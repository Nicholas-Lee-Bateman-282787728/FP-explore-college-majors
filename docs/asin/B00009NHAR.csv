755564,A3Q77CS1DEQLMG,B00009NHAR,Alessandro Bruno,"[3, 4]","""Russian Ark"" by Alexander Sokurov may be interpreted as a film based on a fairy tale structure, which presents the story of the hermitage museum in St. Petersburg, a city which was built at the same time as the palace. Both city and palace have witnessed grandiose and terrible events, while today the former winter residence of the Czars is one of the most famous museums in the world.  The director, Alexander Sokurov takes the viewer along for a visit of the museum, which comes alive with the events that have marked its history in a fairy tale like manner. The viewer is taken for a ride on history, and the historical figures appear at corners and corridors of the palace inviting us to along this journey. Technically speaking the film is remearkable as it as shot entirely in one take; however, it is a film where beauty is expressed almost entirely on a visual level. I visited the Hermitage after seeing the film and could not escape viusalizing events without Sokurov's iimages interfreing. As I saw the portrait of the Persian Shah Abbas, who visited Alexander II, I also grew to appreciate tthate scene that reconstructs that event even more; indeed, it is one of the more effective ones in the film.",5,"The Hermitage, A microcosm of Russian History",1075075200,"01 26, 2004",2004,1214,"['Russian', 'Ark', 'Alexander', 'Sokurov', 'may', 'be', 'interpreted', 'film', 'based', 'fairy', 'tale', 'structure', 'story', 'hermitage', 'museum', 'St.', 'Petersburg', 'city', 'was', 'built', 'same', 'time', 'palace', 'city', 'palace', 'have', 'witnessed', 'grandiose', 'terrible', 'events', 'today', 'former', 'winter', 'residence', 'Czars', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'museums', 'world', 'director', 'Alexander', 'Sokurov', 'viewer', 'visit', 'museum', 'alive', 'events', 'have', 'marked', 'history', 'fairy', 'tale', 'manner', 'viewer', 'taken', 'ride', 'history', 'historical', 'figures', 'appear', 'corners', 'corridors', 'palace', 'inviting', 'along', 'journey', 'Technically', 'speaking', 'film', 'remearkable', 'shot', 'entirely', 'one', 'take', 'however', 'film', 'where', 'beauty', 'expressed', 'almost', 'entirely', 'visual', 'level', 'visited', 'Hermitage', 'seeing', 'film', 'could', 'not', 'escape', 'viusalizing', 'events', 'Sokurov', 'iimages', 'interfreing', 'saw', 'portrait', 'Persian', 'Shah', 'Abbas', 'who', 'visited', 'Alexander', 'II', 'also', 'grew', 'appreciate', 'tthate', 'scene', 'event', 'even', 'more', 'indeed', 'one', 'more', 'effective', 'ones', 'film']",Russian Ark VHS

Of course, I had seen outside pictures of the Hermitage but I had never seen the inside of the Winter Palace wich is absolutely out of this world. There is no words to describe the beauty of that museum. No wonder that, people's life in St. Petersburg, revolves around that breathtaking place. They live FOR art and WITH art and it's very noble. No matter how poor you are, as long as there is art around you, it brings joy and happiness to your soul, somehow. When you are surrounded by such beauty, one never feels  completely alone, and without art ""we are just little worms"" like this man said in the movie.That journey through russian history filled my heart with a lot of emotions, it touched me like any other movie I have seen. Maybe because we will never again witness such grandeur, such magnificence.That movie is a masterpiece and nothing less!

755566,A1LMBOI3T91P87,B00009NHAR,Allan M. Lees,"[6, 6]","Other reviewers have commented ably on the fact that this film is an extraordinary tour-de-force and on the astonishing co-ordination required to make it.  Instead of echoing those cries of delight I would like to add something from a slightly orthgonal perspective.  In modern times we, as recipients of art, have become astonishingly lazy.  We have become accustomed to our entertainment served up in bite-size pieces, easy to digest and requiring no effort on the part of the recipient.  We watch movies that require no knowledge of anything, we listen to music that is banal in the extreme - the list goes on and on.  Even when we listen to more serious art such as a Mozart concerto we don't really know what we are hearing and consequently much of the power of the work simply passes us by.  But if we make a little effort, the results repay us a hundred-fold.  In the case of Mozart, when we know that the painfully beautiful aria sung by the Queen of the Night (in Der Zauberflote) is ornamenting a libretto in which her daughter is being enticed to kill her lover we are struck by the awful contrast between beauty and horror and the power of the piece is greatly intensified.  When we look at Holbein's painting The Ambassadors and we shift our viewing stance to the correct place where we can see the skewed-perspective death's head the painting takes on a deeper and darker meaning than we could otherwise have suspected.And so it is with this tremendous movie.  Unless the viewer takes just a little time and trouble to become acquainted with the broad brush strokes of Russian history, many of the scenes will be nearly meaningless and certainly will lack the power and pathos they contain.  It's true that the character of the Marquis, who acts as our guide and anchor through the scenes, provides his own acerbic commentary on Russia, Russians and their history but it's an intentionally one-sided foil to the off-camera faux-naive mutterings of the film-maker himself.  The ""Russian soul"" has been shaped by many influences and some of the most painful have arisen from (and continue to arise from) the clash between Asiatic and Western European values and attitudes to life.  The setting of the Hermitage is the perfect place to explore some of these contrasts and combinations.  But without some foreknowledge the viewer will simply miss many of the allusions and references and historical figures (who come and go very fleetingly indeed).If you happen to speak a little Russian you'll find much of the dialog is surprisingly easy to understand because there's a minimum of slang and both the principle narrators (the Marquis and the film-maker) speak in a fairly ""clean"" version of Russian.  I found that by the second time through I was following the dialog with ease.Russia is a country that has had more than its fair share of trauma and strife, death and rebirth, hope and disappointment.  The film mirrors these contrasts, being on the one hand a recitation of the horrors (Peter the Great ordering the torture and execution of his son Alexei, for example) and yet also in itself a marvelous affirmation of what Russia and Russians are capable of (who else could have conceived and executed such an intense and masterful piece of work?).  If you have any interest in Russia, this movie is a must-see.  And if, because you're saturated with the drivel generated by the Hollywood studios, you've ever wondered whether it's possible to make a movie that isn't predictable, formulaic and outright boring then this movie will refresh your sense of wonder and lead you to contemplate what other marvels could be created if only people would begin to walk away from the boring, trivial, and silly productions of tinsel-town.",5,Greatness does not come without effort,1168214400,"01 8, 2007",2007,3742,"['Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'commented', 'ably', 'fact', 'film', 'extraordinary', 'tour-de-force', 'astonishing', 'co-ordination', 'required', 'make', 'Instead', 'echoing', 'cries', 'delight', 'would', 'like', 'add', 'something', 'slightly', 'orthgonal', 'perspective', 'modern', 'times', 'recipients', 'art', 'have', 'become', 'astonishingly', 'lazy', 'have', 'become', 'accustomed', 'entertainment', 'served', 'up', 'bite-size', 'pieces', 'easy', 'digest', 'requiring', 'effort', 'part', 'recipient', 'watch', 'movies', 'require', 'knowledge', 'anything', 'listen', 'music', 'banal', 'extreme', 'list', 'Even', 'when', 'listen', 'more', 'serious', 'art', 'such', 'Mozart', 'concerto', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'hearing', 'consequently', 'much', 'power', 'work', 'simply', 'make', 'little', 'effort', 'results', 'repay', 'hundred-fold', 'case', 'Mozart', 'when', 'know', 'painfully', 'beautiful', 'aria', 'sung', 'Queen', 'Night', 'Der', 'Zauberflote', 'ornamenting', 'libretto', 'daughter', 'being', 'enticed', 'kill', 'lover', 'are', 'struck', 'awful', 'contrast', 'beauty', 'horror', 'power', 'piece', 'greatly', 'intensified', 'When', 'look', 'Holbein', 'painting', 'Ambassadors', 'shift', 'viewing', 'stance', 'correct', 'place', 'where', 'can', 'see', 'skewed-perspective', 'death', 'head', 'painting', 'deeper', 'darker', 'meaning', 'could', 'otherwise', 'have', 'suspected.And', 'tremendous', 'movie', 'viewer', 'just', 'little', 'time', 'trouble', 'become', 'acquainted', 'broad', 'brush', 'strokes', 'Russian', 'history', 'many', 'scenes', 'will', 'be', 'nearly', 'meaningless', 'certainly', 'will', 'lack', 'power', 'pathos', 'contain', 'true', 'character', 'Marquis', 'who', 'guide', 'anchor', 'scenes', 'own', 'acerbic', 'commentary', 'Russia', 'Russians', 'history', 'intentionally', 'one-sided', 'foil', 'off-camera', 'faux-naive', 'mutterings', 'film-maker', 'Russian', 'soul', 'been', 'shaped', 'many', 'influences', 'most', 'painful', 'have', 'arisen', 'continue', 'arise', 'clash', 'Asiatic', 'Western', 'European', 'values', 'attitudes', 'life', 'setting', 'Hermitage', 'perfect', 'place', 'explore', 'contrasts', 'combinations', 'foreknowledge', 'viewer', 'will', 'simply', 'miss', 'many', 'allusions', 'references', 'historical', 'figures', 'who', 'come', 'go', 'very', 'fleetingly', 'indeed', '.If', 'happen', 'speak', 'little', 'Russian', ""'ll"", 'find', 'much', 'dialog', 'surprisingly', 'easy', 'understand', 'minimum', 'slang', 'principle', 'narrators', 'Marquis', 'film-maker', 'speak', 'fairly', 'clean', 'version', 'Russian', 'found', 'second', 'time', 'was', 'following', 'dialog', 'ease.Russia', 'country', 'had', 'more', 'fair', 'share', 'trauma', 'strife', 'death', 'rebirth', 'hope', 'disappointment', 'film', 'mirrors', 'contrasts', 'being', 'one', 'hand', 'recitation', 'horrors', 'Peter', 'Great', 'ordering', 'torture', 'execution', 'son', 'Alexei', 'example', 'yet', 'also', 'marvelous', 'affirmation', 'what', 'Russia', 'Russians', 'are', 'capable', 'who', 'else', 'could', 'have', 'conceived', 'executed', 'intense', 'masterful', 'piece', 'work', 'have', 'interest', 'Russia', 'movie', 'must-see', ""'re"", 'saturated', 'drivel', 'generated', 'Hollywood', 'studios', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'wondered', 'possible', 'make', 'movie', ""n't"", 'predictable', 'formulaic', 'outright', 'boring', 'then', 'movie', 'will', 'refresh', 'sense', 'wonder', 'lead', 'contemplate', 'what', 'other', 'marvels', 'could', 'be', 'created', 'only', 'people', 'would', 'begin', 'walk', 'away', 'boring', 'trivial', 'silly', 'productions', 'tinsel-town']",Russian Ark VHS

755568,A2SLA0SXRQV8M0,B00009NHAR,Andres C. Salama,"[7, 9]","Russian Ark has been promoted as a milestone in the history of filmmaking as being the first film ever made in a single shot. Sokurov had his camera tour the Heritage in Saint Petersburg (seat of the Czars from Peter the Great to the Bolshevik revolution) to show us his take on Russian history. The camera moves from room to room and we see Peter the Great, Catherine the Great, we see the son of the Shah of Persia apologizing to the Czar for an attack on the Russian embassy in Tehran, we see a magnificent ball in 1913, and so on. It's a technical tour de force, and it's a beautiful movie to watch. Yet, there's a shallow heart in it, since there's not much to read in it except Sokurov's nostalgia for Russia's imperial past (nothing wrong there, it's his prerogative to have the political views he wishes to have). Sokurov's politically incorrect views tend to be interesting (not having been born or raised in the west, he skipped all the pc nonsense; and not having been raised on the west's popular culture, he's also a man of a very deep culture, something unusual in western directors). Unfortunately, Russian Ark is unusual in Sokurov's oeuvre in being more interested in putting the director in the upscale commercial map than in making a movie that is thought provoking.",3,"Beautiful and innovative, if a bit shallow",1167523200,"12 31, 2006",2006,1285,"['Russian', 'Ark', 'been', 'promoted', 'milestone', 'history', 'filmmaking', 'being', 'first', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'single', 'shot', 'Sokurov', 'had', 'camera', 'Heritage', 'Saint', 'Petersburg', 'seat', 'Czars', 'Peter', 'Great', 'Bolshevik', 'revolution', 'show', 'take', 'Russian', 'history', 'camera', 'room', 'room', 'see', 'Peter', 'Great', 'Catherine', 'Great', 'see', 'son', 'Shah', 'Persia', 'apologizing', 'Czar', 'attack', 'Russian', 'embassy', 'Tehran', 'see', 'magnificent', 'ball', '1913', 'so', 'technical', 'tour', 'force', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'watch', 'shallow', 'heart', 'not', 'much', 'read', 'Sokurov', 'nostalgia', 'Russia', 'imperial', 'past', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'there', 'prerogative', 'have', 'political', 'views', 'have', 'Sokurov', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'views', 'tend', 'be', 'interesting', 'not', 'having', 'been', 'born', 'raised', 'west', 'skipped', 'pc', 'nonsense', 'not', 'having', 'been', 'raised', 'west', 'popular', 'culture', 'also', 'man', 'very', 'deep', 'culture', 'something', 'unusual', 'western', 'directors', 'Unfortunately', 'Russian', 'Ark', 'unusual', 'Sokurov', 'oeuvre', 'being', 'more', 'interested', 'putting', 'director', 'upscale', 'commercial', 'map', 'making', 'movie', 'thought', 'provoking']",Russian Ark VHS
755569,A4VH04TA14CPE,B00009NHAR,"Angry Mofo ""angrymofo""","[19, 43]","He may nominally be a Frenchman, but the character of the ""stranger"" is actually a perfect likeness of the aging, no-longer-relevant Soviet dissident intellectual. He speaks in statements and accusations, ignoring or interrupting his interlocutor. His voice is always much too loud, straining, half-yelling. Even when he talks about aesthetics or spirituality, his tone always contains unpleasant, screeching notes of hysterical vulgarity. One glaring example occurs when he finds some Russian guy looking at a painting of two of Christ's apostles. The ""stranger"" asks the guy if he is religious, the guy says no. Immediately, the ""stranger"" harangues the guy with the line, ""How can you understand this painting if you don't know Scripture?"" He says this in a loud, stentorian voice, like the guy has some obligation to feel guilty in front of him. Then, tellingly, instead of developing this statement, he just repeats it, even louder, as if it's some kind of brilliant irrefutable argument. The guy stammers a justification -- he likes the way the artist depicted the apostles' worn faces and hands -- and the ""stranger"" mockingly repeats his words, as if his condescension alone constitutes a meaningful rebuttal.The narrator's interaction with the ""stranger"" is similar. The narrator goes into a room and meets a famous person from Russian history, such as Czar Peter I. Usually, the famous person is seen doing something boorish and crude. The ""stranger"" gleefully seizes upon each occasion and rubs it in the narrator's face -- see, see, your great historical idols are so uncivilized and uncultured, and you admire them, so that means you're uncivilized and uncultured too, ha ha ha. The narrator tries to argue, but his half-hearted and ineffectual objections basically accept the terms of the debate. His responses run along the lines of ""Yes, but..."" and sometimes he just repeats what the ""stranger"" says without challenging it. In other words, he sounds like he admits his guilt for some great crime (the crime of being inferior, perhaps?), and is timidly trying to justify himself.Consider the title of the film. The Hermitage is called the ""Russian Ark."" That is, the film suggests that the Hermitage somehow embodies the essence of Russian history and culture more than any other building. But this suggestion is very deliberate. It sets up the film in such a way as to allow the ""stranger"" to make one of his main assertions -- that Russians have no culture of their own, except what they allegedly plagiarized from other, allegedly superior cultures. Had the film taken place in the Tretyakov Gallery of Art, or in the Kremlin, buildings of equal historical stature to the Hermitage, the assertion would look silly, but the film bends over backwards to give it an air of legitimacy.For the same reason, Peter I, Catherine II and Aleksandr Pushkin are all portrayed unflatteringly. All three were strong, independent figures in different ways, which is already enough to challenge the ""stranger's"" interpretation of history. So naturally they're his first targets, he has to ridicule them over and over, and woe to anyone who might admire them. But it's the poet Pushkin, not the czars, who gets the most hostile reception. The ""stranger's"" dismissive judgment of Pushkin is full of the aging intellectual's mean, cliquish snobbery: ""Oh, Pushkin, yes, I read him once, he's nothing special. Nothing special at all."" No argument, only airs and condescension. But Nicholas II, on the other hand, is a much weaker figure, and he's valuable for his status as victim, so he and his family are the only Russians whom the film depicts in a positive light.At one point, the ""stranger"" wanders into a room where a disheveled man is making a coffin and yelling about death. The setting is World War II, during the blockade of Leningrad. But when the ""stranger"" asks what is going on, the narrator just says, ""there was a war with Germany,"" and the ""stranger"" (who is supposed to come from the past, before Germany was united) wonders what ""Germany"" is. In the meantime, the guy throws them out of the room while brandishing a hammer and yelling that everyone is going to die. It's as if there is no Germany, as if the blockade just happened by itself, and the guy is just displaying his inherent Russian savagery or something.Then the narrator runs across a few people talking in hushed voices and making veiled references to their fear of the (presumably Soviet, but not stated) government. Someone says that the government never understands or cares about art. Yet this very film was supported by the Ministry of Culture of the Russian Federation, which is stated in the opening credits. Even though there's no real reason why Sokurov should be entitled to such support. Should the French government support a hypothetical film called ""French Ark,"" in which a British lord would walk through the Louvre and repeat over and over that the French have no culture of their own?Quite aside from the content of the film, the script is appalling. The characters repeat absolutely trivial lines of dialogue multiple times, as if they carry great meaning. A typical exchange, as the narrator and the ""stranger"" walk down a hall, might go like this: ""These are nice pictures."" ""Yes, nice pictures."" ""Yes, they are very nice pictures."" ""Nice pictures."" I understand why so many reviewers called the film ""boring."" It's not the slow pace, it's the bad writing.Anyway, eventually the narrator comes across a grand state ball. The ""stranger"" finally relents somewhat, in that he graciously admits that at least Russians know how to party. So, foreign audiences can congratulate themselves on their gracious humanism, after their cultural superiority has been reaffirmed. Sokurov can collect all the awards he can carry, and Russians, well, they probably don't even care about this film. And good for them.",1,"A Frenchman walks into the Hermitage Museum.

The film seems remarkable in two respects: first, for the tour of Russia's magnificent Hermitage Museum and secondly  for the oft-remarked technical achievement of filming in a single 90-minute take.  Personally, I appreciated the first and was bored by the second.  Not only did it drive me, soon enough, to think &quot;So what?&quot;, but after a while I found it very annoying and distracting.  Hitchcock filmed several films with self-imposed constraints -- notably, Lifeboat with one confined set and Rope in one-reel takes -- and in later interviews he said he regretted the artificiality, which he thought detracted from the films.  He was right.  Furthermore, the conceit of the narrative Marquis does not work -- his monologue is strained and, again, distracting and annoying.  What does work is the interesting idea of wandering between historical periods and  the remarkable setting.  You'd probably be better off watching a documentary on the Hermitage.DVD extras are good -- audio commentary; a 43-minute making-of featurette; a 47-minute featurette on the museum; 6 minutes of interviews; filmographies; a trailer.

755572,A355VZC33RZGNA,B00009NHAR,A Viewer and Reader,"[3, 4]","Russian Ark is a fascinating journey though space and time revealing the impact of European culture on Russia.  It begins with Sokarov's disembodied voice encountering the ""man in black', a French Marquis, who leads us into the Winter Palace built by Peter The Great indulging himself in his habit of bludgeoning his courtiers into submission.  The Marquis observes rather contemptuously, ""The more terrible the tyrant the more his memory is cherished ....He built a city on a swamp but the city is still European.""  The Westernization of Slavic Russia began in the early sixteenth century and evolved with Peter The Great who created St. Petersburg in 1703, a city modeled on rational ordered European design.As we ascend a staircase of time and arrive in the Palladian Theatre of the Little Hermitage built for Catherine The Great by a French architect in 1780 they hear music and the Marquis remarks ""What an impressive orchestra, they must be Europeans.""  ""No, they're Russians"" the voice protests. Actually Tsar Peter had little interest in serious music and his musicians were conscripted from the soldiery irregardless of talent or interest, but the musicians that the Marquis hears have improved greatly under Catherine's rule.  And today we are treated to Valery Gergiev conducting the Mariinsky Orchestra in the ball-room scene.""Russia is like a theater"" the Marquis laughs sardonically.  In Tsar Peter's day theater was virtually unknown in Russia except for a small theater Princess Natalya, the Tsar's sister, had established with amateur actors performing her own plays.  Peter invited a professional German theatrical company to reside in Petersburg but it never arrived, and the single little theater in the city soon disappeared.They enter a gallery of bas-reliefs and the Marquis inspects the carvings.  ""So they are copies,"" he announces.  ""Your authorities don't trust your own artists....Russians are so talented at copying....You don't have ideas of your own-- your authorities don't want you to have them.""  The most telling moment is the shot of the cold storeroom filled with stacks of frames empty of Russian expression.The appreciation, if not the creation, of pictorial art was advanced by Catherine The Great who ruled Russia from 1762 to 1796.  She was not Russian. She was German and she commissioned a French architect to design and build the Hermitage where she lived and amassed her collection of Western art amounting to some four thousand paintings.  ""It is not love of art. It is voracity. I am a glutton,"" she announced as she developed into the greatest art collector in European history.The stunning beauty of Sokurov's film offers the message that Russia had been a backward Asiatic nation until it was transformed by Westernization.",5,The Transformation of Russia,1327276800,"01 23, 2012",2012,2774,"['Russian', 'Ark', 'fascinating', 'journey', 'space', 'time', 'revealing', 'impact', 'European', 'culture', 'Russia', 'Sokarov', 'disembodied', 'voice', 'encountering', 'man', 'black', 'French', 'Marquis', 'who', 'Winter', 'Palace', 'built', 'Peter', 'Great', 'indulging', 'habit', 'bludgeoning', 'courtiers', 'submission', 'Marquis', 'rather', 'contemptuously', 'more', 'terrible', 'tyrant', 'more', 'memory', 'cherished', '.He', 'built', 'city', 'swamp', 'city', 'still', 'European', 'Westernization', 'Slavic', 'Russia', 'began', 'early', 'sixteenth', 'century', 'evolved', 'Peter', 'Great', 'who', 'created', 'St.', 'Petersburg', '1703', 'city', 'modeled', 'rational', 'ordered', 'European', 'design.As', 'ascend', 'staircase', 'time', 'arrive', 'Palladian', 'Theatre', 'Little', 'Hermitage', 'built', 'Catherine', 'Great', 'French', 'architect', '1780', 'hear', 'music', 'Marquis', 'remarks', 'What', 'impressive', 'orchestra', 'must', 'be', 'Europeans', 'No', ""'re"", 'Russians', 'voice', 'protests', 'Actually', 'Tsar', 'Peter', 'had', 'little', 'interest', 'serious', 'music', 'musicians', 'were', 'conscripted', 'soldiery', 'irregardless', 'talent', 'interest', 'musicians', 'Marquis', 'hears', 'have', 'improved', 'greatly', 'Catherine', 'rule', 'today', 'are', 'treated', 'Valery', 'Gergiev', 'conducting', 'Mariinsky', 'Orchestra', 'ball-room', 'scene', 'Russia', 'theater', 'Marquis', 'sardonically', 'Tsar', 'Peter', 'day', 'theater', 'was', 'virtually', 'unknown', 'Russia', 'small', 'theater', 'Princess', 'Natalya', 'Tsar', 'sister', 'had', 'established', 'amateur', 'actors', 'performing', 'own', 'plays', 'Peter', 'invited', 'professional', 'German', 'theatrical', 'company', 'reside', 'Petersburg', 'never', 'arrived', 'single', 'little', 'theater', 'city', 'soon', 'disappeared.They', 'enter', 'gallery', 'bas-reliefs', 'Marquis', 'carvings', 'are', 'copies', 'authorities', 'do', ""n't"", 'trust', 'own', 'artists', '.Russians', 'are', 'so', 'talented', 'copying', '.You', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'ideas', 'own', 'authorities', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'have', 'most', 'telling', 'moment', 'shot', 'cold', 'storeroom', 'filled', 'stacks', 'frames', 'empty', 'Russian', 'expression.The', 'appreciation', 'not', 'creation', 'pictorial', 'art', 'was', 'advanced', 'Catherine', 'Great', 'who', 'ruled', 'Russia', '1762', '1796', 'was', 'not', 'Russian', 'was', 'German', 'commissioned', 'French', 'architect', 'design', 'build', 'Hermitage', 'where', 'lived', 'amassed', 'collection', 'Western', 'art', 'amounting', 'four', 'thousand', 'paintings', 'not', 'love', 'art', 'voracity', 'am', 'glutton', 'announced', 'developed', 'greatest', 'art', 'collector', 'European', 'history.The', 'stunning', 'beauty', 'Sokurov', 'film', 'message', 'Russia', 'had', 'been', 'backward', 'Asiatic', 'nation', 'was', 'transformed', 'Westernization']",Russian Ark VHS

The director, whose boldness is like a blistering piece of annoying garbage on one's face on a cold Norwegian day, states that the, ""Hermitage is the greatest museum in the world."" Just from that statement we can then further evaluate that this film is 1) going to rely on manipulating history for its own plight 2) portraying Russians as 'wonderful people and 3) allowing us to see insignificant pieces of junk stolen from countless of eras in the museum. 4) He is completely insane.The film itself was made on one shot by a half bald cinematographer from Germany who complained of back pain after the whole shoot because he was carrying a mobile camera that weighed 250 lbs. Further touches in the editing room configured rooms with dark shadows and an eerie earth tone that seemed almost 'dead like"" and made it seem like this was a Hollywood film.There's not much in the way of the story except an unknown and unseen drunk, played by the camera itself, finds himself in a dank and stench filled restroom, which is actually the foundation of the Hermitage somewhere around the year 1689 and then he encounters a pretentious and annoying old count played by some Russian oaf. All he does is blather around and look at pieces for unusually long periods of time and comment on irrelevant tokens of opportunity such as a beautiful woman walking by who isnt hiding the fact that she has big [.!.]. They keep going into a time machine, which transports them into the next room of the museum, I kept wishing it was the exit, and they keep on commenting about the pieces and about the situation at hand. It isn't even philosophy because the old Russian crank is a really arrogant jerk and he keeps saying stupid things such as, ""I wonder if the Czar eats with butter?"". Its all terribly boring and we must sit through 2 hours worth of it until the end where a bunch of stuffy extras in period pieces dance around a ballroom with Tchaivsky playing in the background. Too bad he couldn't film the lot of the peasants who were freezing and starving to death!There's not much to say in the way of art even, because most of it is fake to begin with, there was a fire in the Hermitage during World War 2 in which most of the museum itself was encapsulated within a great fire.

But many aspects of the film make it different from anything else on the DVD shelf. Unlike most offerings, this isn't a story with a plot line, characters, and dialogue that go from point A to B. It's more of an immersive experience that places you as the viewpoint sweeping through vistas in Petersburg's Hermitage Museum.The motion in Russian Ark is fluid, a flow of images that takes you through a tour of time and place, leaving you with a vague awareness of foregone days. The scenes are dressed in extravagant period costumes in majestic, vaulted spaces. Some of the images seem metaphorical, as is the title, of European cultures preserved beyond regimes and alluded-to invasions, a brief time capsule containing centuries of lives and experiences.You feel like a voyeur, but one who has sparse context to frame the scenes.

755577,A2YXMN40D7WTGP,B00009NHAR,casualsuede,"[8, 20]","This movie is a fantasy and runs off the gimmick that it was shot on one 96 minute take.The movie is a homage to the St. Petersburg Hermitage State Museum, a place that has centuries of history to it. If it isn't, it should be one of the 10 Man-made wonders of the world. It is a place that is so vast, so enormous, that a film that has 2000 extras looks small within it's monstrous walls.The movie begins with a person waking up just outside the museum. He encounters of Renaissance party-goers and believes that he is either watching a production or in a dream. Actually, he is out of his time, a visitor from modern Russian who has been teleported to a vortex where 300 years of Russian history will unfold before him. He is traveling with a French aristocrat/diplomat, who is also out of time. He is with us on our whole trip. The walk through the walls of the Hermitage and view art, sculptures, important periods in St. Petersburg/Russian history with people like Catherine II and Peter the Great coming in and out of the picture. The movie flows effortlessly through the rooms and each room portrays some topic of conversation, whether it is viewing a Persian diplomatic visit to Russia, or the French aristocrat making fun of sailor's uniforms or the modern suit. At the end, the movie ends with grand style at a ball that is a spectacle to view.The gimmick of the movie is the fact that they filmed the movie in one take. While they actually had to stop 4 previous times, they were lucky on the fifth. This movie has the distinct honor of being the longest movie filmed on one shot. While this may seem like something trivial, it does provide a smooth transition between the rooms and the stories and the director pulls it off amazingly. It is not a perfect movie, but within the directors own limitations and rules, it was amazing they didn't give up.The movie is far from perfect though. Those who are not familiar with Russian figureheads (like me) will not know who is what and what their importance is. The film characters does not bother to tell us on most of his observations and expect us to have a basic understanding of Russian history. Well, this will already alienate 99% of the movie going audience. Another problem is that this movie can be very pretentious at times and this is bothersome to a layman like me. One example is when the French aristocrat is looking at magnificent art, he starts critizing it for no other reason than Russia is a poor man's Europe. Again, it is dialog that will not be easily understood by a layman.It's inaccessibility is the key problem with the movie. To those like me, it will bore me because I am never really included into the conversation or the events going on within the movie. I finally understood some when I saw the documentary, which explained who some of these characters were. For example, they mention Russia's finest poet, but they never converses in a way where those who are not knowledgeable of such things can be involved.

Or both. It's that kind of film.You already know what this movie is. One continuous, non-stop shot going through the Hermitage in St Petersburg. Obstensibly it explores three hundred or so years of Russian history. What it really does is showcase Russian art and culture.The movie's visuals are impressive, and the art of course, including the costumes, is amazing.

DeRiemer,"[12, 13]","A 90-minute movie centered on St. Petersburg's Hermitage Museum, filmed in one unbroken take by a digital steadicam, didn't send a lot of Americans racing to buy tickets when it was shown here two or three years ago. The movie, however, is far more than just a technical stunt. It's a unique tour de force with emotional impact.Russian Ark portrays the Hermitage as a kind of cultural and historical ark floating on centuries of Russian seas. The narrative device is a shadowy eighteenth century Frenchman who wanders the halls and time periods, commenting often with good-natured European condescension on what he sees. He is accompanied by a Russian who is never seen, and who questions him about his comments. The movie ranges through time with appearances of Peter the Great, Catherine II, Puskin, Nicholas II and his family, generals, maids, flunkies and diplomats. The Frenchman, played with great style by Russian actor Sergei Dreiden, takes us to painting and sculpture galleries, kitchens, ballrooms, storerooms, basements and living quarters as we observe things that happened in the Hermitage over the centuries.At first, I was very aware of the technical feat of no cuts. Gradually, though, I think most people just relax and accept the skill of the director and photographer, and become immersed in what they are seeing. A kind of unreal imagery takes hold. The movie ends with the last dance held in the Great Ballroom before WWI. Hundreds of actors and dancers, in full costume, swirl around this ornate setting, and swirl around the camera as well, while the camera glides through the crowds. It's a terrific scene, and is followed by the end of the dance with all the hundreds of guests making their way through the halls and staircases to leave the building, with the camera facing them and moving along in front of them.The DVD has several extras, but in my view the best is Film in One Breath. It is the documentary of the making of the movie. Enormous planning went into Russian Ark, and the actual filming required split second coordination with the actors, the lighting and the camerman. Any mistake, and they had to start over. There were two mistakes; they were successful on the third try.

755581,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,B00009NHAR,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[3, 3]","ussian Ark (Russkiy Kovcheg) is one of those films more notable for the technical expertise it exhibits (or preens of) than any real artistic merit. It reminds one of Mike Figgis's 2000 film Timecode, wherein that whole film was supposedly done in four separate single takes, in real time. That claim was debunked by a simple watching of the film, and the film itself was notable for being a screenplay disaster. The four stories, which occupied one fourth of the whole screen the whole time, had volume turned up on one section while the others were backgrounded, and then switched, which made it difficult for the viewer to even stick with whatever tale he preferred. Technically, the film was a mess, and, as there was no real story, just a gimmick, the film bombed critically and financially. Russian Ark, made in 2002 by the infamously somnolent director Alexander Sokurov, has a similar gimmick. While not following four separate stories, it is claimed to have been shot in one continuous take, directly onto a High Definition portable hard drive. It also claims that it was shot over one day, and in real time. While not a technical film expert, I did notice several scenes where the camera passed over black spots, making it the perfect place for an edit to occur, so I tend to believe that the claim of its 87 minute single Steadicam shot are overblown, if not outright false, even though the filmmakers have stated that the completed, unedited film, was done on a fourth attempt by cinematographer Tilman B&uuml;ttner. It could very well just be a slicker version of Alfed Hitchcock's more clumsy attempts in Rope.But, even if wrong, the film is still all style and little substance. Like Timecode, it has an execrable screenplay. Here is its sum narrative: an unnamed an unseen protagonist (voiced by Sokurov, and viewed from his eyes as the camera) wakes up on a winter day and is astonished to be in the 19th Century. He wanders into Peter the Great's Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg- which later became the Russian State Hermitage Museum, that nation's answer to The Louvre and The Metropolitan Museum Of Art. Whether this is a dream or a vision of the afterlife is unclear. The narrator has two companions- another unseen unnamed one, whose voice is heard, and a seen one- a French Marquis (possibly the Marquis de Custine, according to the film information extraneous to the actual narrative) who speaks Russian. He is played by Sergei Dreiden, and helps guide the two unseen travelers through the three dozen grand rooms of the museum. There, we see time flow back and forth from Peter the Great through Catherine the Great through the day before the deaths of the Romanovs through the siege on Leningrad, in World War Two, and back. Other Russian notables, like Alexander Pushkin, have cameos.There is also the feeling, watching the film, and even more so, listening the prattling on about the film in its DVD commentary with producer Jens Meurer, that Sokurov was trying so hard to make a film that was a masterpiece, as well as film history, that he forgot to master a good film. Ok, Russian Ark is not bad, and I'll likely rewatch it, as a curio, but that's it. One wonders what a real filmic master of the little moments, like Yasujiro Ozu, or a master of depth like Akira Kurosawa, or a master of ecstatic truths, like Werner Herzog, would have done with a project like this.In a sense, Russian Ark may indeed, in its better moments, achieve some Russian cultural relevance, but artistically it is pedestrian. Still, I would say see it once, if for the history and achievement- it's sort of like reading bad James Joyce. At least then you'll always be able to say, `Ah, yes, I've seen Russian Ark,' when that pretentious pal of yours asks that at the next party. That neither of you will be able to say much else with zest says all you need to know of this film.",3,Solid but hollow,1221609600,"09 17, 2008",2008,3887,"['ussian', 'Ark', 'Russkiy', 'Kovcheg', 'one', 'films', 'more', 'notable', 'technical', 'expertise', 'preens', 'real', 'artistic', 'merit', 'one', 'Mike', 'Figgis', '2000', 'film', 'Timecode', 'wherein', 'whole', 'film', 'was', 'supposedly', 'done', 'four', 'separate', 'single', 'real', 'time', 'claim', 'was', 'debunked', 'simple', 'watching', 'film', 'film', 'was', 'notable', 'being', 'screenplay', 'disaster', 'four', 'stories', 'occupied', 'one', 'fourth', 'whole', 'screen', 'whole', 'time', 'had', 'volume', 'turned', 'up', 'one', 'section', 'others', 'were', 'backgrounded', 'then', 'switched', 'made', 'difficult', 'viewer', 'even', 'stick', 'tale', 'preferred', 'Technically', 'film', 'was', 'mess', 'was', 'real', 'story', 'just', 'gimmick', 'film', 'bombed', 'critically', 'financially', 'Russian', 'Ark', 'made', '2002', 'infamously', 'somnolent', 'director', 'Alexander', 'Sokurov', 'similar', 'gimmick', 'not', 'following', 'four', 'separate', 'stories', 'claimed', 'have', 'been', 'shot', 'one', 'continuous', 'take', 'directly', 'High', 'Definition', 'portable', 'hard', 'drive', 'also', 'was', 'shot', 'one', 'day', 'real', 'time', 'not', 'technical', 'film', 'expert', 'did', 'notice', 'several', 'scenes', 'where', 'camera', 'passed', 'black', 'spots', 'making', 'perfect', 'place', 'edit', 'occur', 'tend', 'believe', 'claim', '87', 'minute', 'single', 'Steadicam', 'shot', 'are', 'overblown', 'not', 'outright', 'false', 'even', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'stated', 'completed', 'unedited', 'film', 'was', 'done', 'fourth', 'attempt', 'cinematographer', 'Tilman', 'B', 'uuml', 'ttner', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'just', 'be', 'slicker', 'version', 'Alfed', 'Hitchcock', 'more', 'clumsy', 'attempts', 'Rope.But', 'even', 'wrong', 'film', 'still', 'style', 'little', 'substance', 'Timecode', 'execrable', 'screenplay', 'Here', 'sum', 'narrative', 'unnamed', 'unseen', 'protagonist', 'voiced', 'Sokurov', 'viewed', 'eyes', 'camera', 'up', 'winter', 'day', 'astonished', 'be', '19th', 'Century', 'Peter', 'Great', 'Winter', 'Palace', 'Saint', 'Petersburg-', 'later', 'became', 'Russian', 'State', 'Hermitage', 'Museum', 'nation', 'answer', 'Louvre', 'Metropolitan', 'Museum', 'Art', 'Whether', 'dream', 'vision', 'afterlife', 'unclear', 'narrator', 'two', 'companions-', 'unseen', 'unnamed', 'one', 'voice', 'heard', 'seen', 'one-', 'French', 'Marquis', 'possibly', 'Marquis', 'de', 'Custine', 'according', 'film', 'information', 'extraneous', 'actual', 'narrative', 'who', 'Russian', 'played', 'Sergei', 'Dreiden', 'guide', 'two', 'unseen', 'travelers', 'three', 'dozen', 'grand', 'rooms', 'museum', 'see', 'time', 'flow', 'back', 'forth', 'Peter', 'Great', 'Catherine', 'Great', 'day', 'deaths', 'Romanovs', 'siege', 'Leningrad', 'World', 'War', 'Two', 'back', 'Other', 'Russian', 'notables', 'Alexander', 'Pushkin', 'have', 'cameos.There', 'also', 'feeling', 'watching', 'film', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'listening', 'prattling', 'film', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'producer', 'Jens', 'Meurer', 'Sokurov', 'was', 'trying', 'so', 'hard', 'make', 'film', 'was', 'masterpiece', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'history', 'forgot', 'master', 'good', 'film', 'Ok', 'Russian', 'Ark', 'not', 'bad', ""'ll"", 'likely', 'rewatch', 'curio', 'One', 'what', 'real', 'filmic', 'master', 'little', 'moments', 'Yasujiro', 'Ozu', 'master', 'depth', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'master', 'ecstatic', 'truths', 'Werner', 'Herzog', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'project', 'this.In', 'sense', 'Russian', 'Ark', 'may', 'indeed', 'better', 'moments', 'achieve', 'Russian', 'cultural', 'relevance', 'artistically', 'pedestrian', 'Still', 'would', 'say', 'see', 'once', 'history', 'achievement-', 'sort', 'reading', 'bad', 'James', 'Joyce', 'least', 'then', ""'ll"", 'always', 'be', 'able', 'say', 'Ah', 'yes', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Russian', 'Ark', 'when', 'pretentious', 'pal', 'yours', 'asks', 'next', 'party', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'say', 'much', 'else', 'zest', 'need', 'know', 'film']",Russian Ark VHS

Director Alexander Sokurov creates a visually beautiful and thought provoking tour of the famous Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg.  We accompany a long deceased French diplomat who travels across three centuries of Russian history.  His witty and sometimes sarcastic remarks reveal the attitudes of one of his station in life during the eighteenth century.  The Hermitage has a very cruel and haunting history.  Russian nobles such as Catherine the Great were dictators indifferent to the suffering of the common people.  Many paid dearly to put together this fantastic collection.  One can almost sense the ghosts who still roam the Hermitage's many rooms of breath taking art work.I am, though, afraid that many might ignore the Russian Ark due to the snobbish comments of certain members of the cinematic intelligentsia.  These folks get overly excited about the fact that the director completed this film in an unbroken 90 minute span.  Needless to add, most of us could care less.

755587,A2SRZQU1SZG4RR,B00009NHAR,"Erika Borsos ""pepper flower""","[12, 13]","This awe-inspiring film by Alexander Sokurov was filmed at the Museum of the Hermitage, former palace of the Tsars in St Petersburg, Russia. It was done in one take which is a first of its kind. The film is most unusual and creative in that it is narrated by a French Marquis who occasionally is a voyeur to Russian history as it unfolds while strolling through the Hermitage. History unfolds before his eyes and the Marquis occasionally interacts with various people of different eras whom he is viewing. This is a creative and magnificent production which contrasts the European viewpoint of Russian art, culture and history against Russia's own point of view of the same ...The film begins in a haunting, dream-like manner when the French Marquis discovers himself in 18th Century Russia ... watching handsome young officers and their beautiful female partners enter the palace during the time of Peter the Great. The French Marquis is describing what he sees and interprets it for the film viewer, while another disembodied spirit, who has only a voice, occasionaly expresses the Russian point of view about the same scene. This film takes the viewer through 300 years of Russian history and at least four galleries of the Hermitage, as well as the ballroom and other private areas. The French Marquis opens private doors and enters into 18th century Russian aristocratic life. At one point, he recognizes the poet Pushkin during an encounter. The French Marquis also describes and interprets artwork by great Masters displayed on the walls, for instance, a famous painting by Van Dyke and a very exquisite marble statue of three naked muses by the sculptor Canova. The Marquis comments on Russian tastes in art and also about Russian music which he hears coming from a conservatory ...Several of my favorite scenes are when Catherine the Great comes to life before our eyes. Catherine the Great was the founder of the museum. Initially, she bought over 200 paintings which now has grown to a collection of over 2.7 million items. There are five palaces which make up the complex. Her walk outside into the winter snow on the grounds of the Hermitage seems haunting, prophetic and beautiful beyond description. Another authentic looking scene is when a Persian envoy arrives before the throne of the Tsar, with the intention of creating a pact of peace after a Russian diplomat had been murdered in Tehran. The magnificence, grandeur and solemnity of the occasion is indescribable. One of the most impressive scenes was the ballroom scene, when handsome Russian officers and elegantly dressed ladies danced a mazurka to a live orchestra. The costumes were period pieces created just for this film, based on authentic clothes worn by aristocrats of that era. There was a great scene were the Marquis entered the dining room before the guests arrived for dinner. He admired the hand-painted blue and gold porcelain dinner ware (the real thing which was lent by the museum for use in the film). Another haunting and well done scene is when the Marquis enters a dusty room where he is admonished by ""the voice"" to not go. It houses remnants of the past related to World War II ... of which the Marquis would have no knowledge. He was told Germany and Russia went to war and the Russians paid a high price as over one million died. The film ends on a positive note, when the ballroom guests file out, walking down long corridors, and down marble staircases, wearing their magnificent finery, eventually to be escorted to their waiting horse-drawn carriages. The final scene shows an icey ocean which seems to represent the great Unknown ... the void, possibly Infinity.This DVD has a great section, called ""Film in One Breath"", which chronicles how the film was made. There are comments by Alexander Sokurov where he explains his goals and intentions during the filming process. The camerman, Tilman B&uuml;tner, provides insights into the technical difficulties of making a film in one single take. The film was very expensive to make, it had a cast of over 850, most of whom wore 18th Century costumes made especially for this occasion. A special camera called ""steadycam"" was made in Canada specifically for creating this film. It was also the first of its kind. There were numerous organizational and lighting problems to overcome to create the right scene, with the right effects. Great challenges were arose related to set design, lighting and the proper use of architecture which obviously could not be changed.Alexander Sokurov was also the director of ""Mother and Son"" another cinematic masterpiece with highly original filming techniques which made the film look like a French impressionistic painting that came to life. It told a very touching and sensitive story. Truly it depicts the Russian soul during its finest moment. Both  films ""Russian Ark"" and ""Mother and Son"" are highly recommended.

When his eyes focus, he sees before him a carriage of aristocrats hurrying through the cold to the Hermitage in St. Petersburg.  Invisible, he follows them into the palace where he meets a French Marquis.  Together, they roam the halls of the Hermitage, discussing art, people and Russia while spying on Catherine the Great, Nicholas and Alexandra, Pushkin and other great figures of Russian history.Director Aleksandr Sokurov has chosen to tell his story in one continuous 96-minute shot -- a first of its kind.  No editing or film breaks; just a single take, almost as if you were walking through the Hermitage with the characters.  What also makes this film unique and beautiful is the seamless intermingling of time periods.  In the hallway, it's the grandeur of the 18th Century with tsars and tsarinas, but open a door, and you step into the 20th Century where the general public can come to view the magnificent works of art.  Through another door, and you're following Anastasia as she runs down a hallway dressed as a nymph to have a final meal with Nicholas and Alexandra.I saw the film in the theater and am impressed with the DVD.  The picture and sound qualities are very good.  The &quot;Making of &quot; featurette is definitley worth watching, and, to me, is just as intriguing as the film.  I did have a problem with some parts of the dialogue as it is hard to tell who is speaking and to whom the subtitles belong.  but, this is definitely a fine movie and one worth watching many times.",4,"300 Years of Russian History in a Continuous, 96-minute shot",1064188800,"09 22, 2003",2003,1584,"['accident', 'man', 'complete', 'darkness', 'not', 'sure', 'where', 'When', 'eyes', 'focus', 'carriage', 'aristocrats', 'hurrying', 'cold', 'Hermitage', 'St.', 'Petersburg', 'Invisible', 'palace', 'where', 'French', 'Marquis', 'Together', 'roam', 'halls', 'Hermitage', 'discussing', 'art', 'people', 'Russia', 'spying', 'Catherine', 'Great', 'Nicholas', 'Alexandra', 'Pushkin', 'other', 'great', 'figures', 'Russian', 'history.Director', 'Aleksandr', 'Sokurov', 'chosen', 'tell', 'story', 'one', 'continuous', '96-minute', 'shot', 'first', 'kind', 'No', 'editing', 'film', 'breaks', 'just', 'single', 'take', 'almost', 'were', 'walking', 'Hermitage', 'characters', 'What', 'also', 'film', 'unique', 'beautiful', 'seamless', 'intermingling', 'time', 'periods', 'hallway', 'grandeur', '18th', 'Century', 'tsars', 'tsarinas', 'open', 'door', 'step', '20th', 'Century', 'where', 'general', 'public', 'can', 'come', 'view', 'magnificent', 'works', 'art', 'door', ""'re"", 'following', 'Anastasia', 'down', 'hallway', 'dressed', 'nymph', 'have', 'final', 'meal', 'Nicholas', 'Alexandra.I', 'saw', 'film', 'theater', 'am', 'impressed', 'DVD', 'picture', 'sound', 'qualities', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'quot', 'Making', 'quot', 'featurette', 'definitley', 'worth', 'watching', 'just', 'as', 'intriguing', 'film', 'did', 'have', 'problem', 'parts', 'dialogue', 'hard', 'tell', 'who', 'speaking', 'whom', 'subtitles', 'belong', 'definitely', 'fine', 'movie', 'one', 'worth', 'watching', 'many', 'times']",Russian Ark VHS

This 90-minute film is, indeed, just one single take, i.e., when they made the film they just let the camera roll for 90 minutes straight.  No editing (except perhaps sound editing?).  The German cameraman, in an interview, complains that he almost died while shooting the film using his 30+kg Steadycam system.2) Knowledge of Russian history.  The entire ""film"" takes place inside the Hermitage, a massive museum in St. Petersburg.  The film has actors dressed in period costumes and takes you through something like 300 years of Russian history, up to the Revolution of 1917.  If you know little about Russian history, you are bound to be very bored after the first ten minutes.3) You cannot be cynical (like me) and believe that the only reason this film was made was so the director and producers could get into the Guinnes book of records for making the longest single-take film in history.  Ok, maybe also a bit of Russian nationalistic propaganda, but I can accept that since Russian culture and history are fascinating.There's very little acting or story-telling, except for some historical reenactments which unfortunately are not familiar to me or my Russian friends when we watched the film together.  Even they felt immensely bored, so we ended up fast-forwarding the film and then watched a more entertaining French-American flick ""Wicker Park"" afterwards.",2,A very niche film that will bore even most art film lovers,1110844800,"03 15, 2005",2005,1424,"['enjoy', 'film', 'need', 'following:1', 'Stamina', '90-minute', 'film', 'indeed', 'just', 'one', 'single', 'take', 'i.e.', 'when', 'made', 'film', 'just', 'let', 'camera', 'roll', '90', 'minutes', 'straight', 'No', 'editing', 'perhaps', 'sound', 'editing', 'German', 'cameraman', 'interview', 'almost', 'died', 'shooting', 'film', 'using', '30+kg', 'Steadycam', 'system.2', 'Knowledge', 'Russian', 'history', 'entire', 'film', 'place', 'Hermitage', 'massive', 'museum', 'St.', 'Petersburg', 'film', 'actors', 'dressed', 'period', 'costumes', 'something', '300', 'years', 'Russian', 'history', 'up', 'Revolution', '1917', 'know', 'little', 'Russian', 'history', 'are', 'bound', 'be', 'very', 'bored', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes.3', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'cynical', 'believe', 'only', 'reason', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'was', 'so', 'director', 'producers', 'could', 'get', 'Guinnes', 'book', 'records', 'making', 'longest', 'single-take', 'film', 'history', 'Ok', 'maybe', 'also', 'bit', 'Russian', 'nationalistic', 'propaganda', 'can', 'accept', 'Russian', 'culture', 'history', 'are', 'very', 'little', 'acting', 'story-telling', 'historical', 'reenactments', 'unfortunately', 'are', 'not', 'familiar', 'Russian', 'friends', 'when', 'watched', 'film', 'together', 'Even', 'felt', 'immensely', 'bored', 'ended', 'up', 'fast-forwarding', 'film', 'then', 'watched', 'more', 'entertaining', 'French-American', 'flick', 'Wicker', 'Park', 'afterwards']",Russian Ark VHS

The movie is similarly lacking, but has other weaknesses that the preview didn't.In the film a narrator wakes up after an explosion.  He reallizes that he is in the hermitage in the past and soon meets a black clad European (he doesn't say where he is from, only ""Strange, I never spoke Russian before."").  The narrator talks with the European, but not with any of the people they observe.  The European, on the other hand, interacts with the people they meet.  We see this as one continuous take seen through the narrator's eyes.As they travel through the Hermitage, they periodically time travel.  They may cross a threshhold or turn around to find that modern-day tourists have taken the place of the Romanovs.  This would be cool if there were something going on.  There isn't.  At one point, it seems that people with whom the European was interacting, have time traveled with him so that 1800's people stand next to people from our time, but he and the narrator walk into another room and we never see any of those characters again, so whatever possibilities there were of a plot forming vanish.  (No plot ever forms, by the way.)The fabulous preview was filled with costumes and scenes with lots of motion going on.  The movie has these, but almost all of them are in the preview, and it was only about 2 minutes long.  The movie also has a lot of slow pans over artwork or footage of the European walking down a hall of the Hermitage.  I think that maybe the whole point of the movie was to advertise, ""Hey, we filmed this in the Hermitage.""  These scenes are a bit dull, since the movie doesn't give background on what is being shown - it isn't anything like a documentary.This review makes the movie sound better than it actually is.  It is very slow going.  I recommend everyone, normal people, libraries, university libraries, Russian teachers, to pass on this one.  If you must watch it, and at anypoint feel bored (and how could you not?) then I recommend fast forwarding until something hopeful happens.  It will never pick up, but hopefully that will dawn on you quickly.",1,Fabulous preview... and the movie was terrible,1149984000,"06 11, 2006",2006,2262,"['preview', 'Russian', 'Ark', 'fabulous', 'however', 'one', 'tiny', 'detail', 'overlooked', 'time', 'preview', 'clues', 'what', 'plot', 'movie', 'might', 'be', 'movie', 'similarly', 'lacking', 'other', 'weaknesses', 'preview', 'film', 'narrator', 'up', 'explosion', 'hermitage', 'past', 'soon', 'black', 'clad', 'European', ""n't"", 'say', 'where', 'only', 'Strange', 'never', 'spoke', 'Russian', 'before.', 'narrator', 'talks', 'European', 'not', 'people', 'observe', 'European', 'other', 'hand', 'interacts', 'people', 'meet', 'see', 'one', 'continuous', 'take', 'seen', 'narrator', 'eyes.As', 'travel', 'Hermitage', 'periodically', 'time', 'travel', 'may', 'cross', 'threshhold', 'turn', 'around', 'find', 'modern-day', 'tourists', 'have', 'taken', 'place', 'Romanovs', 'would', 'be', 'cool', 'were', 'something', 'going', ""n't"", 'one', 'point', 'people', 'whom', 'European', 'was', 'interacting', 'have', 'time', 'traveled', 'so', '1800', 'people', 'stand', 'next', 'people', 'time', 'narrator', 'walk', 'room', 'never', 'see', 'characters', 'again', 'whatever', 'possibilities', 'were', 'plot', 'forming', 'vanish', 'plot', 'ever', 'forms', 'way', 'fabulous', 'preview', 'was', 'filled', 'costumes', 'scenes', 'lots', 'motion', 'going', 'movie', 'almost', 'are', 'preview', 'was', 'only', 'about', '2', 'minutes', 'long', 'movie', 'also', 'lot', 'slow', 'pans', 'artwork', 'footage', 'European', 'walking', 'down', 'hall', 'Hermitage', 'think', 'maybe', 'whole', 'point', 'movie', 'was', 'advertise', 'Hey', 'filmed', 'Hermitage', 'scenes', 'are', 'bit', 'dull', 'movie', ""n't"", 'give', 'background', 'what', 'being', 'shown', ""n't"", 'anything', 'documentary.This', 'review', 'movie', 'sound', 'better', 'actually', 'very', 'slow', 'going', 'recommend', 'everyone', 'normal', 'people', 'libraries', 'university', 'libraries', 'Russian', 'teachers', 'pass', 'one', 'must', 'watch', 'anypoint', 'feel', 'bored', 'how', 'could', 'not', 'then', 'recommend', 'fast', 'forwarding', 'something', 'hopeful', 'will', 'never', 'pick', 'up', 'hopefully', 'will', 'dawn', 'quickly']",Russian Ark VHS

For me, it was a highly enjoyable guided tour through the rooms, galleries, and halls of one of the greatest museums in the world. I have not been to Hermitage (Winter Palace) for over fourteen years, and to see the familiar rooms, stairs, paintings, and sculptures was like traveling back in time. The film is also the journey over three hundred years of the Russian history and the attempt to understand the country's place and meaning in European culture. Each of the palace's rooms is filled with memories, shadows, whispers, smiles, and tears of the people whose lives have made the history of the country. The fact that it is all presented in a single, the longest uninterrupted shot ever makes it even more incredible. I also saw the documentary about making ""Russian Ark"". It is called ""On One Breath"" - that's how the director, Alexander Sokurov wanted his audience to feel about the film that was shot in a single glorious take during several hours on one winter night.

755592,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00009NHAR,Grady Harp,"[65, 69]","Aleksandr Sokurov has created a unique, wondrous masterpiece of a film in his great homage of Russian history and art and the Hermitage Museum.  Four years in the planning, a cast of thousands, exquisite reproductions of costumes that span the three hundred years of Russian history, and brilliant cinematography by the German Tilman Buttner, Sokurov has condensed the essence of Russian culture in a 90 minute non-stop 'live' filming within the halls of the Hermitage museum (all 5 palaces known as the winter palaces of the Tsars).  The result is an enchanting, bewitching, meandering tour of Russian from the time of Catherine the Great, Peter the Great, Pushkin, the Romanovs - Nicholas I and II - to the final ball in the palace the night Tsarist Russia ended.  Our tour guide is the off camera voice of Sokurov in conversation with a French Marquis and assorted ghosts of the past as we seamlessly view glimpses of Russia's past, scenes like an actual play that Catherine the Great wrote and watched, the writer Pushkin, the Romanov family at their last supper in the palace and the grand ball that culminates this stage of the glory of Russia.  The ballroom scene is resplendent with vast numbers of costumed actors  dancing a mazurka to the music (Glinka's mazurka from his opera 'The Life of the Tsar') provided by the Maryinski Orchestra conducted by no less than Valery Gergiev! As the guests finally leave the Hermitage museum the camera focuses on an open window overlooking the sea on which the city of St Peterburg floats.  We then know that we have been on an ark of Russian culture for the past 90 minutes - an immeasureably beautiful and sensitive document that has captured all the mystery of Russia's history, presented with tenderness and finesse and with the extraordinary facility using the newest of digital camera technology.  This is a magnificent epic film and deserves a wide audience on its own.

755593,A2UYAFQ40U2PHS,B00009NHAR,"Grigory's Girl ""GR""","[8, 9]","Strictly from a technical standpoint, this film is amazing.  As we well know, it is shot in a single, 96 minute, unbroken take.  It was shot once after nearly 7 months of rehearsal.  It was shot on a specifically designed HD video camera that recorded the information to hard disk.  The disk could hold 100 minutes of information, but could not be recorded over.  After 2 false starts, they completed the film on the third take.  So many things could have gone wrong during this, but it didn't, thankfully.  Now, if this was just a technical stunt (like Mike Figgis's inferior film Time Code, which had 4 unbroken, 90 minute video takes), it probably wouldn't really be worth seeing.  Luckily, Alexander Sokurov tells a great story, filled with intelligence, passion, art, emotion, and the history of Russia.  This is not simply a technical stunt.  Sokurov wanted to make a film about Russia, its culture, and its relationship with the West, told through the art contained in the Hermitage.  There is a tender soul to this film, which makes the whole film overwhelming near the end.  Sokurov is an amazing filmmaker.  His other great films include Mother and Son, Father and Son, and Confession.  This is one of the most beguiling films I've ever seen, and it becomes more beautiful and wonderous with each viewing.  There is a featurette on the making of this film, which is completely fascinating to watch.  One of the camera assistants had a portable camera attached to them while Tillman Buttner (the director of photography) filmed this film.  So you get to see how intricate this film was, and how one slip up could have destroyed the whole undertaking.  Imagine someone slipping at minute 46 and saying ""ok, we have to start over.

Other films have dealt with similar premise (the ill-conceived Timecode, for example, features 4 uncut shots simultaneously), but it's even more impressive here because the movie isn't in real-time.

755601,A2OLKV9F2S7O6N,B00009NHAR,James W. Picht,"[7, 10]","I'll confess to being extremely impressed with Russian Ark as an artistic and technical accomplishment. I'm as impressed as anyone with Sokurov's ability to film it in one take (and the ability of the actors late in the film to keep their composure - the fear of messing up at the very end of the thing would probably have made me faint as soon as the camera turned in my direction), and the images are sumptuous and lovely. They could hardly be otherwise in as gorgeous a setting as the Hermitage (Winter Palace). I'm not a very good photographer, and almost every photo I've taken of or in the place over the years looks like a masterpiece.This is clearly a movie in the strict sense of the word, but it's more like a piece of performance art than a movie. It has the power to move me, but I love Russian history and have studied it for years. If you don't know anything about Russian history, watching this film will be something like looking at a painting by Mondrian or Pollock after a lifetime of looking at Rockwells and El Grecos. It will probably leave you cold and baffled, but liking the pretty colors, costumes, and sets. I'd recommend spending some time with Pushkin, Catherine the Great, and Dostoyevsky before watching this. That won't guarantee that you'll like it (I can't really say that I do), but you'll have some basis for understanding it.If it was Sokurov's goal to make something moving and emotional (I've read that it was), he wasn't entirely successful; if it was his goal to make something beautiful and impressive, he did a fine job. I can't help but feel, though, that beauty isn't enough to make a great film.",3,"A lovely work of art, but a movie?",1130457600,"10 28, 2005",2005,1640,"[""'ll"", 'confess', 'being', 'extremely', 'impressed', 'Russian', 'Ark', 'artistic', 'technical', 'accomplishment', ""'m"", 'as', 'impressed', 'anyone', 'Sokurov', 'ability', 'film', 'one', 'take', 'ability', 'actors', 'late', 'film', 'keep', 'composure', 'fear', 'messing', 'up', 'very', 'end', 'thing', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'made', 'faint', 'as', 'soon', 'camera', 'turned', 'direction', 'images', 'are', 'sumptuous', 'lovely', 'could', 'hardly', 'be', 'otherwise', 'as', 'gorgeous', 'setting', 'Hermitage', 'Winter', 'Palace', ""'m"", 'not', 'very', 'good', 'photographer', 'almost', 'photo', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'place', 'years', 'masterpiece.This', 'clearly', 'movie', 'strict', 'sense', 'word', 'more', 'piece', 'performance', 'art', 'movie', 'power', 'move', 'love', 'Russian', 'history', 'have', 'studied', 'years', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'Russian', 'history', 'watching', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'something', 'looking', 'painting', 'Mondrian', 'Pollock', 'lifetime', 'looking', 'Rockwells', 'El', 'Grecos', 'will', 'probably', 'leave', 'cold', 'baffled', 'liking', 'pretty', 'colors', 'costumes', 'sets', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'spending', 'time', 'Pushkin', 'Catherine', 'Great', 'Dostoyevsky', 'watching', 'wo', ""n't"", 'guarantee', ""'ll"", 'like', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'say', 'do', ""'ll"", 'have', 'basis', 'understanding', 'it.If', 'was', 'Sokurov', 'goal', 'make', 'something', 'moving', 'emotional', ""'ve"", 'read', 'was', 'was', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'successful', 'was', 'goal', 'make', 'something', 'beautiful', 'impressive', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'beauty', ""n't"", 'enough', 'make', 'great', 'film']",Russian Ark VHS
755602,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,B00009NHAR,Jeffrey Leach,"[10, 11]","Stunning. Visually arresting. Groundbreaking. Moviegoers who have seen Alexander Sokurov's ""Russian Ark"" know these terms apply in spades to this pioneering motion picture. Why? Because this little film set in the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia is a period piece ranking right up there with Stanley Kubrick's ""Barry Lyndon."" It is also the only film to date-that I have heard of, anyway-to use a single ninety-six minute shot. That's right-no cuts, no crazy zooms, no MTV style editing to be found in this film. It would doubtless entertain greatly to watch a person accustomed to Britney Spears's videos or the latest Vin Diesel film attempt to view Sokurov's production. I suspect they would either fall asleep immediately or suffer some sort of sensory input malfunction. A viewer who doesn't need a lot of flash, eardrum shattering music, or CGI effects to the nth degree is the ones who will get the most out of ""Russian Ark."" I suspect other filmmakers will soon attempt to replicate this director's pioneering cinematography in their own works, and that's all right. After all, Sergei Eisenstein's montage technique soon found innumerable copycats. What is it with Russian filmmakers and groundbreaking cinema? Must be something in the water.""Russian Ark"" boasts thousands of characters, but the most important are a French Marquis and his Russian narrator. The nobleman suddenly ""wakes up"" in the Hermitage, surprised not only to find himself in Russia but also that he speaks Russian so well. He begins to stroll around the museum, taking in its artwork and the people he discovers in the various rooms. The Marquis is quite a character, a typical eighteenth/nineteenth century European that considers Russia a backward nation populated with barbaric Orientals and ruled over by bumpkin nobles. He often praises obviously European objet d'art even as he scoffs at the ""inferior"" Russian imitations. The good Marquis even has the temerity to criticize the type of artwork purchased abroad! His Russian companion tries to put up an appropriate defense of his people and his country, pointing out paintings and sculptures he finds marvelous. Still, the two disagree more often than they find common ground.Something quite peculiar occurs as these two individuals stroll about the museum. Time is not what it seems in the Hermitage, as historical figures from various epochs in Russian history turn up in every room. The Marquis sees Peter the Great, Catherine, Pushkin, Tsar Nicholas II hobnobbing with his doomed family, a state visit from a Persian emissary, three directors of the museum pondering art, and an amazing ballroom party that is definitely the best part of the film. He also meets and argues with twentieth century Russians. Guess who we don't see wondering the halls in contemplation of the greatness adorning the walls? Yep, you got it. Nary a Lenin, Trotsky, Stalin, or Khrushchev can be found anywhere in the Hermitage. The only visual reference to the communist years I saw was a scene where the Marquis stumbles over a freezing room with pictures stacked up against the walls while bombs explode outside, obviously a snapshot of the dark days of World War II. That last, lingering shot of the partygoers filing out of the ballroom only to confront a freezing ocean outside the doors is an amazing metaphor for Russia's culture. Always adrift between Europe and Asia, threatened from without and from within, Sokurov's film says that Russia did develop its own unique culture and that it must be preserved at all costs. That ocean, I think, represents not only Western European encroachment in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, but the horrific nightmares of the communist takeover. Fortunately, the Hermitage-the Ark-protects Russia's glory.Are there anachronisms in ""Russian Ark""? Probably, but I didn't see any leaping off the screen. I am no expert on Russian history, and definitely no expert on art, but I know more than the average guy on the street about these historical eras. The great thing about the movie is that you don't need to be an expert on Russia to get something out of it. If you don't understand the ins and outs of art or history, the splendid visuals and the anticipation that a cut must, absolutely must, happen at some point is enough of a reason to watch the film. The ballroom mazurka at the end of the picture can be enjoyed by anyone regardless of nationality or breadth of historical knowledge. Watching that colorful procession going on and on for nearly thirty minutes brought tears to my eyes. I can only imagine what effect the film would have on a Russian.The extras make the disc. You get a commentary, a trailer, a behind the scenes featurette, a short series of interviews with the principal crewmembers, and a fascinating look at the Hermitage and St. Petersburg. I found the latter extremely interesting as it showcases several individuals associated with restoring the treasures of the museum, a resident of the city who often visits the Hermitage, and a father interested in teaching his son about the country. All of these people have a great love of the museum, the culture, and the country. Particularly noteworthy is the man with the phonograph. He looks like he stepped right out of a Tolstoy novel, embodying everything we associate with the archetypical Russian. He's happy even while sad, whimsical and deeply religious. I highly recommend ""Russian Ark"" to anyone looking for a magical film filled with beautiful images. It's not for everyone, obviously, but it is a treasure trove for those viewers willing to put forth a little effort.",5,Not for everyone,1087862400,"06 22, 2004",2004,5634,"['Stunning', 'Visually',

This has to be one of the most boring, tedious films ever made. It is also one of the most daring and beautiful visions ever recorded.Sokurov takes us on a tour of the Hermitage, in one unedited, 96 minute tracking shot, and along the way, we encounter notable figures from the Romanov dynasty ( Peter and Catherine the Great, Nicholas I, Alexander III, Nicholas II and family) living in their natural habitat (the Hermitage served as a royal residence), doing normal things that monarchs do, like humiliating underlings, hosting foreign dignitaries, and giving grand balls for the aristocracy. The exquisite art and surroundings, gorgeous period costumes, lush orchestral music, and a cast of thousands, coupled with the ingenious filming method, create a sinuous, dreamlike, almost hypnotic mood. The camera's 1st person perspective has Sokurov (the modern man) confused, as if in a dream, following a gangly, Russian speaking French Marquis from the 18th century, who's dressed all in black, and frequently makes disparaging remarks about Russian culture. This ""guide"" is the focal point of the film, and acts as a symbolic link between Russia and Western Europe leading up to the Revolution. At points during the tour they enter rooms or galleries filled with modern people, who the guide can't relate to, so the contrast is not merely between cultures, but between the old and the new.There is in fact enough symbolism and innuendo in RUSSIAN ARK to satisfy those afficianados of art film who demand it, but I really don't think the general public would get it. I would give it a 5 star rating if it could in some way communicate it's message better.

After you see it, run through the extra material on the disk to understand how this incredible film was made. It's even worth another round with the Producers' commentary turned on through the film (he speaks English).It amazes me to think that this film was able to be produced in such a setting, and I know that it will never happen again.

And, since the Hermitage could only close for one day, they had little time for mistakes.While the technical work is admirable, I realized that I do like movies to have some cuts and edits.  Following a single scene for so long was dizzying and I ended up watching the DVD in two segments to give myself a break.

I saw in another review that someone got in an accident and woke up to this scene, but somehow I didn't catch that and was continually wondering who the main characters were.The costumes are spectacular and the glimpses of Russian history, interspersed with questions about Russia's identity and place within Europe, are great.

We get to learn a great deal about the way our French ambassador thinks about Russia, but what do we learn about other important aspects of Russian history?  A great deal of time is spent viewing paintings, which is a good thing, since it did not add to the already extremely expensive budget(if my suggestions are to be meaningful, they should not be expensive suggestions).  When we get to rather expensive situations, such as our encounter with Catherine II, we only see her pretty face and learn that she needs to pee.  Why couldn't we have MEANINGFUL encounters with important historical figures, other than museum administrators?  The movie gets a little boring simply because we focus on one character only:  our French ambassador.  Even the orchestra conductor, in his interview, points out that the movie seems to come to life in the last scene; so why did the rest have to drag?  It seems strange to tell Russians that they suffer from a lack of plurality of characters!

755608,AQ79DO3H5GRS2,B00009NHAR,John Wykes,"[5, 5]","When I first hear about Sukarov's ""Russian Ark,"" most discussion centered on its nature as a feature-length single shot.  This in itself is an amazing achievement -- Hitchcock did something like this with ""Rope,"" but made some necessary (though seemless) cuts whenever the film ran out.  Sukarov's achievement is possible thanks to HD (high definition video) and it looks beautiful.  However, the technique is not an end in itself, but a means to an end.The message of the film, according to its director, is that culture is like an ark in a turbulent sea.  It is culture that expresses who we are, what we feel, what we believe, and how we live.  The Hermitage is therefore much more than a museum, and this film much more than a colorful historical pageant.  It is a celebration of Russian life -- a poignant reflection on the complex and often convoluted journey of the Russian people through time.  Oftentimes the poignancy is expressed visually through ommission -- the charming but brief family dinner of Nicholas II and his family speaks of impending doom.  That the images are tranquil only heightens the contrast to the bullet riddled bodies we never see on screen.  Similarly, the final ball is almost surreal in its celebratory tone -- as the guests leave they speak of perhaps arranging another ball of their own, since this one was so enjoyable, but we know that their words are in vain, for their world is coming to an end, a fact to which they seem blissfully unaware.Sukarov strives to shoot in real time -- thus no cuts.  An official apology delivered to Nicholas I is shown in all its splendor and forced pageantry.  Because there are no cuts, and because the camera meanders freely about the room, the scene seems much less like a historical reconstruction and much more like a documentary.The tone is so real, in fact, that we feel as if we are actually seeing the real Nicholas I, playing with the real Anastasia, and following the real Catherine the Great as her feet crunch the snow in her thoroughly-wintered garden.  What could have been a ponderous cinematic exercise becomes a dream-like excursion through time.  We float, along with the camera, from room to room, taking in pieces of history, gazing at the marvelous artwork, and running into one great historical event after another.Sukorov's succeeds in creating a meditative work of art.  Like many of his films, ""Russian Ark"" is best seen not as a film, but a dream-like meditation.  Those who have the patience and a contemplative state of mind will find a viewing of this film most worthwhile.",5,A compelling and moving exploration of humanity,1133568000,"12 3, 2005",2005,2577,"['When', 'first', 'hear', 'Sukarov', 'Russian', 'Ark', 'most', 'discussion', 'centered', 'nature', 'feature-length', 'single', 'shot', 'amazing', 'achievement', 'Hitchcock', 'did', 'something', 'Rope', 'made', 'necessary', 'seemless', 'whenever', 'film', 'ran', 'out', 'Sukarov', 'achievement', 'possible', 'thanks', 'HD', 'high', 'definition', 'video', 'beautiful', 'However', 'technique', 'not', 'end', 'end.The', 'message', 'film', 'according', 'director', 'culture', 'ark', 'turbulent', 'sea', 'culture', 'who', 'are', 'what', 'feel', 'what', 'believe', 'how', 'live', 'Hermitage', 'therefore', 'much', 'more', 'museum', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'colorful', 'historical', 'pageant', 'celebration', 'Russian', 'life', 'poignant', 'reflection', 'complex', 'often', 'convoluted', 'journey', 'Russian', 'people', 'time', 'poignancy', 'expressed', 'visually', 'ommission', 'charming', 'brief', 'family', 'dinner', 'Nicholas', 'II', 'family', 'speaks', 'impending', 'doom', 'images', 'are', 'tranquil', 'only', 'contrast', 'bullet', 'riddled', 'bodies', 'never', 'see', 'screen', 'Similarly', 'final', 'ball', 'almost', 'surreal', 'celebratory', 'tone', 'guests', 'leave', 'speak', 'perhaps', 'arranging', 'ball', 'own', 'one', 'was', 'so', 'enjoyable', 'know', 'words', 'are', 'vain', 'world', 'coming', 'end', 'fact', 'seem', 'blissfully', 'unaware.Sukarov', 'strives', 'shoot', 'real', 'time', 'thus', 'cuts', 'official', 'apology', 'delivered', 'Nicholas', 'shown', 'splendor', 'forced', 'pageantry', 'are', 'cuts', 'camera', 'meanders', 'freely', 'room', 'scene', 'much', 'less', 'historical', 'reconstruction', 'much', 'more', 'documentary.The', 'tone', 'so', 'real', 'fact', 'feel', 'are', 'actually', 'seeing', 'real', 'Nicholas', 'playing', 'real', 'Anastasia', 'following', 'real', 'Catherine', 'Great', 'feet', 'crunch', 'snow', 'thoroughly-wintered', 'garden', 'What', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'ponderous', 'cinematic', 'exercise', 'dream-like', 'excursion', 'time', 'float', 'camera', 'room', 'room', 'taking', 'pieces', 'history', 'gazing', 'marvelous', 'artwork', 'running', 'one', 'great', 'historical', 'event', 'another.Sukorov', 'creating', 'meditative', 'work', 'art', 'many', 'films', 'Russian', 'Ark', 'best', 'seen', 'not', 'film', 'dream-like', 'meditation', 'who', 'have', 'patience', 'contemplative', 'state', 'mind', 'will', 'find', 'viewing', 'film', 'most', 'worthwhile']",Russian Ark VHS
755609,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B00009NHAR,Joseph Haschka,"[13, 15]","The most remarkable thing about RUSSIAN ARK is that it was filmed with a Steadicam in one unbroken take ninety-plus minutes long utilizing a couple thousand precisely cued and magnificently costumed actors. This was necessitated by the fact that the location, the Hermitage Museum (the former Winter Palace) in St. Petersburg, Russia, was available for only one day. But where did they rehearse? And most important, did Hermitage staff allow the actors to bring munchies inside?As the film opens, an invisible individual (let's call him &quot;The Visitor&quot;), through whose eyes the viewer takes this journey and whose voice is that of Director Alexander Sokurov, is admitted to the snowbound Winter Palace with a group of uniformed czarist army officers and their dates arriving for a gala event. The Visitor soon leaves the revelers behind and joins &quot;The Marquis&quot; (Sergey Dreiden), a Frenchman that serves as the guide for most of the movie. As The Visitor and The Marquis go from room to room, they and the viewer are either in the present, surrounded by modernly dressed tourists, or in some century past, fleetingly meeting such historical figures as Peter the Great, Catherine the Great, and Nicholas II. Ghosts, perhaps?RUSSIAN ARK is primarily a magnificent visual introduction to the Winter Palace of the czars, and one most likely to be useful to one who hasn't experienced the place firsthand. This fact, and the cinematic achievement represented by the skillfully choreographed action photographed in the single take, would otherwise cause me to award 5 stars - except for the dialogue (Russian with English subtitles). The majority of the words spoken by The Visitor, The Marquis, and those they encounter convey little of import or relevance. Indeed, what emanates from the preoccupied Marquis isn't usually much better than distracted mumbles.For those acquainted with Russian history, one of the most poignant scenes is when The Visitor and The Marquis encounter Nicholas II's young daughters - to be brutally murdered by the Reds within a couple of years - breezily skipping along the palace corridors. And the climax of the film is the last thirty minutes or so as the viewer mingles among the elegant, pre-Revolution crowd dancing in a glittering ballroom, and then exits with the throng down a spectacular gold and white grand staircase and out through a long interior promenade.Needless to say, RUSSIAN ARK has no plot in the conventional sense. Had the various scenes been shot separately, they'd be nothing more than a series of unrelated vignettes of marginal interest.RUSSIAN ARK is a film only possible after the implosion of the USSR. It's a peek at a grandiose and &quot;decadent&quot; way of life now gone from Russia - and Europe - for many decades.

I purchased the film at the visitor's center and went home eagerly to watch it.Well...after one watching,it sat never to be viewed again.Why? Because the filming process couldnot convey to the small screen! Hence RUSSIAN ARK,lavishly filmed with High definition cameras in one four hour take that sweeps (at times quite confusingly if you are not somewhat acquainted with at least the major highpoints of Russian History!!!!) through The Hermitage where all of Russia's past treasures and glory is contained (like the Ark of God from the Old Testament).This Alexsandr Sokurov ""life dream"" is HIS dream,

equipped to convey the HD experience (similar to my IMAX debacle)what the director intended, and what you ACTUALLY get watching this film on either enhanced vhs or dvd at your home is simply NOT the same.As it is my intention to review the product RUSSIAN ARK:THE MASTERWORKS EDITION ,I must say ""Sorry ""for those who have had nearly orgasmic experiences concerning this 96 minute tour on Russian history.(Trust me,I repeat, that if you know nothing of Russian History you will find yourselves wishing you were at The National Gallery in D.C. looking at Picasso!)To have someone NOT spend good money on a product that is not what the director intended is worth my ""sour grapes"" .Unless this film is shown near you,perhaps at a University (where I recently saw it) or an Art Gallery or in a revival at a Movie House,I cannot recommend anyone buying this film and watching the aspect ratios changed,the colours dulled and the sweeping magnitude of the director's intention pushed onto a small screen.(The dvd extras are informative,but again,who cares when you cannot view the film as intended!!!YOU WILL NOT GET THIS FILM AS IT WAS MEANT TO BE EXPERIENCED!)When viewed outside it's original venue,RUSSIAN ARK,which apart from the technological aspects,really is a rather dull and lifeless narrative and the continued ongoing room-to-room tour will have you wanting to exit way before  the

For that alone this film is special, but its weird mix of times and spaces and general imagination makes it even more unique.Sadly, and this may be my issue and not the film's, I faded after a while, despite the technical brilliance. I think my general ignorance about the history of the Hermitage and Russian painting made me appreciate this a lot less than I might have had I known more about the subject. For deep fans of the place and/or art, though, I can only imagine what a transcendent experience this would be.To be honest, my favorite thing on the dvd is an extra, the Sokurov film Hubert Robert: A Fortunate Life. It really moved me at times, and I highly recommend it.The other extra, a making-of doc about Russian Ark, is also worth watching even if just to marvel at how they shot this movie in one take with 2,000 extras, and made it work this well. Incredibly impressive, as is Sokurov's vision here.Perhaps I'll return to Russian Ark in 20 years and know enough to really revel in its many glories.

755613,A1WTYALNQNQG99,B00009NHAR,Larry L. Looney,"[140, 152]","One of the most visually stunning films ever made, Alexandr Sokurov's RUSSIAN ARK is a landmark creation on many levels, many of which have been touted in numerous articles and reviews.  From a purely technological aspect, it's the first feature-length film ever made using a single camera photographing a single 96-minute shot in one take, with no edits.  The documentary feature on the DVD gives the viewer an inside look at the challenges of this approach - made more daunting by the fact that during the winter in St. Petersburg, the crew only had about 4 hours of daylight with which to work.  The logistics requiring the crew surrounding the camera - including the director - to stay out of view, even as the cinematographer spun 360 from time to time, are a major work or choreography in themselves.  Sokurov's dedication to his project - and the dedication of his crewmembers - is both apparent and very moving.In an interview included in the `making of' documentary on the DVD, the director states `I'm sick of editing.  I don't want to experiment with time.  I want to screen real time - it should be as it is.  One doesn't have to fear the flow of time.'  So many filmmakers are so concerned that their audience's attention span is so short that they will become bored if things don't `move right along' - it lowers cinema to the `lowest common denominator', fails to challenge the audience, and, in the final analysis, insults the viewer's intelligence.  There's no danger of that in any of Sokurov's work - the viewer's mind (and emotions) are given quite a workout, and, as with physical exercise, are stronger for it in the end.Some critics - who perhaps have no patience for being required to think about what they're seeing - criticize Sokurov and other visionary directors (such as the great Andrei Tarkovsky) as being cold and emotionless.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Sokurov has stated in several forums that one of the goals of RUSSIAN ARK - and all of his work - is to evoke strong emotions in the viewer.  The methods of his creation might be different from those we have come to expect from the major Hollywood studios - but they are very effective, and more thought provoking in the bargain.In RUSSIAN ARK we experience Russia's treasured museum, the Hermitage, from the point of view of a `visitor' - we never see his face, only hear his voice and thoughts (by Sokurov himself) as he walks through the Winter Palace, viewing tableaux from 300 years of Russian history enacted before his eyes.  He is accompanied for most of his journey by another character - unnamed in the film, but based on the Marquis de Custine, who published a travel book in 1839 entitled EMPIRE OF THE CZAR:  A JOURNEY THROUGH ETERNAL RUSSIA - with whom he converses and debates the scenes they see before them.  We witness Peter the Great berating one of his generals;  a play written by the Tsarina is performed for her and selected guests;  the appearance before the Tsar of a delegation from Persia, there to apologize for the murder of a Russian diplomat in their country;  a grand ball featuring a full symphony orchestra and hundreds of dancers (perhaps the visual climax of the film);  and in perhaps the film's most poignant moment, we witness Tsar Nicolas and his family dining together, blissfully unaware of their impending fate.  Along the journey from room to room, from tableau to tableau, the viewer, along with the narrator and the Marquis, can gaze upon some of the most breathtaking art the world has ever produced.  Even the building itself, with its incredible architecture and opulent outfittings, is a character in its own right - Sokurov's vision has brought the Hermitage to life in a way that draws the viewer right into every frame.The director has succeeded marvelously in his effort to show the `living' aspects of history, of art.  Museums have an undeserved reputation for being `dead' places - they couldn't be more alive.  The dangers in abandoning or forgetting our past have been shown time and time again, in both social and political theatres.  As the Marquis states at one point during the film, `Everyone can see the future - but no one remembers the past.'Sokurov stated that he had long held a dream of `making a film in one breath' - he has achieved that beautifully in RUSSIAN ARK, and it will take your breath away as well.  This is cinema for the time capsule.As far as I have been able to ascertain, the only other Sokurov film available in the US is MOTHER AND SON - check it out as well, and pray that more of his work will become accessible.The best way to see any great film is, of course, on the screen - so don't pass up any opportunity to experience him in that way, either.",5,TECHNOLOGICALLY -- AND EMOTIONALLY -- BREATHTAKING CINEMA,1064275200,"09 23, 2003",2003,4742,"['One', 'most', 'visually', 'stunning', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'Alexandr', 'Sokurov', 'RUSSIAN', 'ARK', 'landmark', 'creation', 'many', 'levels', 'many', 'have', 'been', 'touted', 'numerous', 'articles', 'reviews', 'purely', 'technological', 'aspect', 'first', 'feature-length', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'using', 'single', 'camera', 'photographing', 'single', '96-minute', 'shot', 'one', 'take', 'edits', 'documentary', 'feature', 'DVD', 'viewer', 'inside', 'look', 'challenges', 'approach', 'made', 'more', 'daunting', 'fact', 'winter', 'St.', 'Petersburg', 'crew', 'only', 'had', '4', 'hours', 'daylight', 'work', 'logistics', 'requiring', 'crew', 'surrounding', 'camera', 'including', 'director', 'stay', 'view', 'even', 'cinematographer', 'spun', '360', 'time', 'time', 'are', 'major', 'work', 'choreography', 'Sokurov', 'dedication', 'project', 'dedication', 'crewmembers', 'apparent', 'very', 'moving.In', 'interview', 'included', 'making', 'documentary', 'DVD', 'director', ""'m"", 'sick', 'editing', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'experiment', 'time', 'want', 'screen', 'real', 'time', 'should', 'be', 'One', ""n't"", 'have', 'fear', 'flow', 'time', 'So', 'many', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'so', 'concerned', 'audience', 'attention', 'span', 'so', 'short', 'will', 'become', 'bored', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'move', 'right', 'cinema', 'lowest', 'common', 'denominator', 'challenge', 'audience', 'final', 'analysis', 'insults', 'viewer', 'intelligence', 'danger', 'Sokurov', 'work', 'viewer', 'mind', 'emotions', 'are', 'given', 'quite', 'workout', 'physical', 'exercise', 'are', 'stronger', 'end.Some', 'critics', 'who', 'perhaps', 'have', 'patience', 'being', 'required', 'think', 'what', ""'re"", 'seeing', 'criticize', 'Sokurov', 'other', 'visionary', 'directors', 'such', 'great', 'Andrei', 'Tarkovsky', 'being', 'cold', 'emotionless', 'Nothing', 'could', 'be', 'further', 'truth', 'Sokurov', 'stated', 'several', 'forums', 'one', 'goals', 'RUSSIAN', 'ARK', 'work', 'evoke', 'strong', 'emotions', 'viewer', 'methods', 'creation', 'might', 'be', 'different', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'major', 'Hollywood', 'studios', 'are', 'very', 'effective', 'more', 'thought', 'provoking', 'bargain.In', 'RUSSIAN', 'ARK', 'experience', 'Russia', 'treasured', 'museum', 'Hermitage', 'point', 'view', 'visitor', 'never', 'see', 'face', 'only', 'hear', 'voice', 'thoughts', 'Sokurov', 'Winter', 'Palace', 'viewing', 'tableaux', '300', 'years', 'Russian', 'history', 'enacted', 'eyes', 'accompanied', 'most', 'journey', 'character', 'unnamed', 'film', 'based', 'Marquis', 'de', 'Custine', 'who', 'published', 'travel', 'book', '1839', 'entitled', 'EMPIRE', 'THE', 'CZAR', 'JOURNEY', 'THROUGH', 'ETERNAL', 'RUSSIA', 'whom', 'scenes', 'see', 'witness', 'Peter', 'Great', 'berating', 'one', 'generals', 'play', 'written', 'Tsarina', 'performed', 'selected', 'guests', 'appearance', 'Tsar', 'delegation', 'Persia', 'apologize', 'murder', 'Russian', 'diplomat', 'country', 'grand', 'ball', 'featuring', 'full', 'symphony', 'orchestra', 'hundreds', 'dancers', 'perhaps', 'visual', 'climax', 'film', 'perhaps', 'film', 'most', 'poignant', 'moment', 'witness', 'Tsar', 'Nicolas', 'family', 'dining', 'together', 'blissfully', 'unaware', 'impending', 'fate', 'journey', 'room', 'room', 'tableau', 'tableau', 'viewer', 'narrator', 'Marquis', 'can', 'gaze', 'most', 'breathtaking', 'art', 'world', 'ever', 'produced', 'Even', 'building', 'incredible', 'architecture', 'opulent', 'outfittings', 'character', 'own', 'right', 'Sokurov', 'vision', 'brought', 'Hermitage', 'life', 'way', 'viewer', 'right', 'frame.The', 'director', 'succeeded', 'marvelously', 'effort', 'show', 'living', 'aspects', 'history', 'art', 'Museums', 'have', 'undeserved', 'reputation', 'being', 'dead', 'places', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'alive', 'dangers', 'abandoning', 'forgetting', 'past', 'have', 'been', 'shown', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'social', 'political', 'theatres', 'Marquis', 'states', 'one', 'point', 'film', 'Everyone', 'can', 'see', 'future', 'one', 'past', 'stated', 'had', 'long', 'held', 'dream', 'making', 'film', 'one', 'breath', 'achieved', 'beautifully', 'RUSSIAN', 'ARK', 'will', 'take', 'breath', 'away', 'as', 'well', 'cinema', 'time', 'capsule.As', 'far', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'ascertain', 'only', 'other', 'Sokurov', 'film', 'available', 'US', 'MOTHER', 'AND', 'SON', 'check', 'out', 'as', 'well', 'pray', 'more', 'work', 'will', 'become', 'accessible.The', 'best', 'way', 'see', 'great', 'film', 'course', 'screen', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'pass', 'up', 'opportunity', 'experience', 'way']",Russian Ark VHS

Alcat ""Curiosity killed the cat, but sa...","[5, 6]","Filmed in a single take, this movie allows the Hermitage to speak about Russia, specially its culture and history. Of course, that statement might seem a little weird, considering that the Hermitage is merely a building. But then, some say that no building is just a building, that we should consider them witnesses of our lives, and of those who lived before us  :)If that is true, then the possibilities surrounding the Hermitage are enormous. After all, it is one of the greatest museums in the world, and before that is was the Winter Palace of the Tzar. Who could act better as witness to Russian history, and culture, and as an ark containing that?. I think that is just what the director, Alexandr Sokurov, thought. His idea must have been to allow a silent ""character"" to speak, and strangely enough, he succeeded...The plot almost doesn`t exist, but don`t panic, some kind of movies don`t need a great one in order to be enjoyed. In this, the visual images take precedence to any kind of convoluted plot. The idea is simple: you are invited to a tour through the Hermitage, as it changed through the ages. There are no time barriers: only the Hermitage and you...Well, I suppose that isn't entirely true: there are also another two characters, a French diplomat and a voice. Yes, you read that well: a voice. That voice belongs to a person we never see (as a matter of fact, it is Sukurov's voice), who accompanies the disoriented Frenchman in his tour of the Hermitage. The Frenchman doesn't know neither how on earth he arrived at the Hermitage, nor how he suddenly managed to learn Russian, but he doesn't seem too worried about that. Instead, he just seizes the opportunity offered to his senses, and studies the beautiful paintings and the extraordinary architecture. Due to the fact that time constraints somehow disappeared, he also gets to see some scenes of Russian history. He makes some illuminating comments, from the perspective of a Frenchman of the 19th century, of course.On the whole, I believe this is a must see movie. However, you must keep in mind that its pace is sometimes too slow, so watch it only if you are fully awake. I have more than a few friends who have slept through long parts of this movie. That doesn't mean that it is bad, it merely  makes us aware of the fact that we should only watch it when we are in the mood for paying careful attention to details.

The entire hour-and-a-half film is one uninterrupted take. No edits. No stopping. Tilman Buttner, the film's cinematographer,  supported and maneuvered a digital Steadicam through 33 rooms of St. Petersburg's Hermitage Museum for an hour and a half while the action played out before the camera. Director Alexander Sukurov used  2,000 actors, thousands of lavish costumes, precise choreography, and impeccable timing to bring Russian history to life inside the Hermitage Museum, which was for centuries the Winter Palace for Russia's Tzars. The audience sees through the eyes of a modern Russian man, perhaps a ghost, who is able to wander the rooms of Hermitage invisible to those he observes. This man is our narrator, for lack of a better word. His voice is that of director Alexander Sukurov. The narrator encounters another man who is out of place and sometimes unseen by others, a French Marquis who lived in Russia in the early 19th century. The Marquis serves as a guide and provides a running commentary on Russian culture and art, which was not to his liking during his lifetime. As our narrator and the Marquis wander from room to room, they witness the people and history that inhabited the Hermitage through centuries of Romanov rule and into the 20th century. We catch glimpses of Peter the Great, Catherine the Great, Nicholas I, Nicholas II and witness the last days of Tzarist government. The Marquis articulates a Western European view of Russian culture as second-rate and borrowed, while our narrator draws attention to works of Russian origin while acknowledging the tendency for Russians to collect foreign art. The film culminates in a magnificent ball with live orchestra, which would have been logistically difficult to film in multiple takes or even to organize in real life, so is especially impressive filmed in one sweeping take. Director Alexander Sukurov has said that &quot;Russian Ark&quot; is &quot;a film about the Hermitage, for the Hermitage.&quot; Although it is interesting to identify and observe the various prominent figures from Russian history that we see, the film isn't a history lesson. It is more like a fly on the wall in the Hermitage Museum, with cultural commentary from both Russian and European, modern and aristocratic, points of view. The background conversations are apparently of so little importance that they are often not translated. I found myself wondering what people were saying though, so some knowledge of Russian might add to the enjoyment of the film. Filming in one long take could be considered an unnecessary gimmick, but the continuous shot does give the feeling of sweeping through the halls of the Museum and its history. &quot;Russian Ark&quot; does require patience. Not everything that went on within the walls of the Hermitage was interesting, and our guide was not chosen for having a winning personality.

This might go down in cinema history alongside Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin, Godard's Breathless, and Antonioni's L'Avventura as revolutionary icons of filmic language.  Well, perhaps not that far, but time will tell. ;-)As a narrative, the film is insightful and entertaining but hardly revolutionary.  What we get is a spotty rendering of Russian cultural history as manisfested in the halls and annals of the Hermitage in St. Petersburg, Russia.  However, it's cleverly told through the wanderings and confabulations of a semi-fictional French marquis paired with a presumably modern day accidental time traveler who's represented by an off-camera voice and a point-of-view steadicam.  Both find themselves, suddenly and inexplicably, at the Czar's Winter Palace in the 18th Century.  From there, it's a marvelous series of tableaus depicting various events, personages, and works of art which have held their presence there across three centuries.  We slip from one era to another as our wandering pair traverse various physical thresholds within the palace.It's difficult to measure the film's resonance since one is simply in awe of the technical achievement--it was all shot in one single ninety-minute take!  The stagings and filming (on hard drive, but it looks like film) are a wonder of rehearsal, logistics, and precision timing--to say nothing of mental and physical endurance.  Yes, it was contrived as such, so perhaps the style ""is"" the substance here.  But when was the last time you've marveled at a cinematic technical achievement that occurs ""before"" post-production?Whether one truly enjoys the film is probably dependent on one's appreciation of Russian history in relation to its culture as well as to that of Europe as a whole.  Just know that the acting, stagings and costumes are wonderfully authentic. The direction, cinematography, and sound are superb. Though the events depicted are mere snippets, they just might inspire one to explore further.

The director, whose boldness is like a blistering piece of annoying garbage on one's face on a cold Norwegian day, states that the, ""Hermitage is the greatest museum in the world."" Just from that statement we can then further evaluate that this film is 1) going to rely on manipulating history for its own plight 2) portraying Russians as 'wonderful people and 3) allowing us to see insignificant pieces of junk stolen from countless of eras in the museum. 4) He is completely insane.The film itself was made on one shot by a half bald cinematographer from Germany who complained of back pain after the whole shoot because he was carrying a mobile camera that weighed 250 lbs. Further touches in the editing room configured rooms with dark shadows and an eerie earth tone that seemed almost 'dead like"" and made it seem like this was a Hollywood film.There's not much in the way of the story except an unknown and unseen drunk, played by the camera itself, finds himself in a dank and stench filled restroom, which is actually the foundation of the Hermitage somewhere around the year 1689 and then he encounters a pretentious and annoying old count played by some Russian oaf. All he does is blather around and look at pieces for unusually long periods of time and comment on irrelevant tokens of opportunity such as a beautiful woman walking by who isnt hiding the fact that she has big [.!.]. They keep going into a time machine, which transports them into the next room of the museum, I kept wishing it was the exit, and they keep on commenting about the pieces and about the situation at hand. It isn't even philosophy because the old Russian crank is a really arrogant jerk and he keeps saying stupid things such as, ""I wonder if the Czar eats with butter?"". Its all terribly boring and we must sit through 2 hours worth of it until the end where a bunch of stuffy extras in period pieces dance around a ballroom with Tchaivsky playing in the background.  Too bad he couldn't film the lot of the peasants who were freezing and starving to death!There's not much to say in the way of art even, because most of it is fake to begin with, there was a fire in the Hermitage during World War 2 in which most of the museum itself was encapsulated within a great fire.

This movie takes place in St. Petersburg, Russia, and  brings us ninety minutes of the history of ""The Hermitage Museum"" told in an unusual image of the 18th and 19th centuries. The remarkable piece of this movie is that it is shot in one fluid take using High Definition video cameras.The State Hermitage is in actuality 6 buildings on the embankment of the River Neva. The most magnificent of the buildings is the Winter Palace, residence of Russian Tsars from 1754 to 1762. The Hermitage took 2 1/2 centuries to build and exemplifies pieces from the Stone Age to the 20th Century. There are over 3 million pieces of art on display from Da Vinci to Monet.  Some of the most exciting times took place during the German Invasion in 1941. We are indeed fortunate that many hid the treasures within, and that the treasures were found after the war. The Hermitage is open to the public and you can find more information on their web page:[...]867 actors practiced for months to dance the mazurka in the ballroom, march to a military salute or watch a theatre performance. There was one take only and anything could go wrong at any time. There were years of development and preparation for the 4 hours of filming. Sokurov depended upon German HD specialists  KOPP MEDIA to assist with the details of the script. How a camera would move, the distance of feet to be covered in the narrative, and the use of a steadicam. A hard disk recording system was developed that was portable and equipped with an ultra-stable battery. One shooting day with 4 hours of light was the magic number.A Marquis, a limber European in dress black is the film's guide. He is invisible to most and he leads the narrator through each room and gallery. He interacts with guests but others do not see the ""ghost"". The Marquis takes us from the 17th century to the present. We meet Catherine the Great, Nicholas I, and there is no explanation of what is happening or what are their roles. We are left to our imagination and the beautiful rooms and halls and galleries that are The Hermitage. The last thirty minutes are dedicated to 3 orchestras and the ballrooms and the dancing and the exquisitely dressed people of the times.

755627,ANM2SCEUL3WL1,B00009NHAR,Pristine,"[7, 7]","Since I make it a point to forego reading reviews, plot summaries, and descriptions before embarking on a movie, the thing that intrigued me the most about Russian Ark was the metaphor: Where and What is a Russian Ark?It was only halfway through the movie I realized the absence of that omniscient modern-day device in American moviemaking: 5 choppy angles and cuts-per-second a la Bruckheimer.  I ignored it and continued watching the film.  Of course, a part of me did marvel at the technical feat of pulling off such a long take, but to appreciate the Russian Ark because the movie was filmed in one continuous take, would be like asking someone to admire Proust's Remembrances of Things Past because it has 1.5 million words.I'm not sure whether the trailers were geared towards American filmgoers, since the whole selling point seemed to pivot on the tagline: 2000 actors, 300 years, 90 minutes, 1 take.  How could anyone forget the almost non-sequitur American trailers to Bergman films in the sixties?For fans of Russian filmmaker Andrei Tarkovski's work (whom Sokurov is seen as the heir), the notion of ""Sculpting with Time"" is brought to its logical and technological limit in Russian Ark.  The continuous shot utilizes formalism to create a flow that may take getting used to.  Having seen Sukorov's Second Circle and Robert Hubert: A Fortunate Life (a short that walks through the Hermitage Museum as well), I was prepared for a slow moving film.Fans of period pieces will love this film as four years went into the preparation of this 90 minute sequence.  No detail was overlooked in costume design and set recreation.  What was astounding to me was the way the notion of extreme compression forced one to re-evaluate time duration itself.  In thinking about Russian Ark, one suddenly realizes just how much can be accomplished in the span of ninety minutes.

There is something so unique, so thought provoking about it, that it cannot be dismissed as ""boring.""  Some of the single sentence comments are sufficient to start thinking, even something as basic as the Marquis' remark on the modern men's suits - that dressing that way stifled creativity.  (I have to agree that men used to dress MUCH better)There is another interesting and positive aspect to the movie - I watch it walking and running on the treadmill.  Since it is shot in one continuous scene, with the cammera man (excellent work, Tilman!) walking, the pace on the treadmill keeps up in the walking speeds with the camera, and one feels like they are accompanying these two gentlemen on their journey.  And what a journey it is.  I can't afford the trip to St. Petersburg to see the Hermitage in person, but this movie is about as close as it gets, and having the historical events and figures interspersed throughout, makes it an enchanting history lesson as well.  Others have covered the music and costumes, and the director spared nothing on the details there, giving it accuracy and authenticity.Finally, the message of the film is reflected in the reviews.  Some people appreciate art and culture while others don't see the importance in maintaining it.  The point of the movie is to show that the Hermitage is an ark preserving culture and tradition while tossed in an ocean of those who don't appreciate - the results of which are all around us.

755630,A2WL02ENWFU9PM,B00009NHAR,Rex Macaroe,"[2, 6]","Ever since the creation of feature-length films, Russian Ark has been an inescapable inevitability. If you don't already know, it is the first and so far the only movie to be made in only one take. The entire film is one long tracking shot.I went in knowing that, and I promised I wouldn't mention that fact in my review. But, like the film, it was an inevitability. However, I did not know going in that the tracking shot is a POV shot. It didn't really make much difference. We see through someone else's eyes, but never really get to know whose POV we share.Shall we press forward?The goal of the film is to visually capture three hundred years of Russian history. I myself am little familiar with the details recounted, but there is a strange hypnotic quality that kept me intrigued. It's impossible to judge the film by the same standards as one would most others because it's not really a drama. It's an onscreen ballet that turns the audience into one of the dancers.The film didn't really inspire me in the way it was meant. Most of the film consists of watching people look at the art from collections held by historical figures. The cameraman and his European guide drift in and out of invisibility as they walk among the relics of the past, travelling between periods as they walk from room to room. Neither is sure how he ended up there, but they remain too in awe of their surrounds to bother. The truth is eventually revealed, but it is no huge twist given how strange the film is to begin with.The film never bored me, but it never entirely captivated me either. It reminded me of the rides of Epcot at Disney. You strap yourself in your seat and let yourself be guided through an animatronic universe explaining whichever region to which the ride belongs. This dares to be a little more frank about its subject matter, but at the same time, you never quite feel transported the way you do on such rides.If Fellini were to make an entire film based on the ending of 8 1/2, it would probably be something like this.

It is ironic, and strangely fitting, therefore, that it should be the Russians who, almost a full century later, have now produced the first full-length feature film ever to be composed of a single unedited shot running uninterrupted from first moment to last (Hitchcock came close with ""Rope,"" but he did include a few ""cuts"" in the course of the film).  Even Sergei Eisenstein, who, in films like ""Potemkin"" and ""Ten Days That Shook the World"" spent his career developing and demonstrating the power of editing, would, I dare say, be impressed by ""Russian Ark,"" a film every bit as innovative and challenging as those earlier seminal works.For their bravura, awe-inspiring cinematic tour-de-force, director Alexander Sokurov and cinematographer Tilman Buttner take us into the famed Hermitage Museum and Winter Palace in St. Petersburg, providing us with a grand tour not only of the opulent rooms and famous artwork contained therein, but of 300 years of Russian history as well, as various vignettes involving famous people (from Peter and Catherine the Great to Nicholas and Alexandra) and events are played out within the glorious gilded walls.""Russian Ark"" is a bold and audacious project that is the cinematic equivalent of a breathlessly performed high wire juggling act.  We know that one false move on the part of the actors or the cameraman, one missed cue or accident of fate could bring the whole delicately poised enterprise crashing down around them.  How often, one wonders, did a perfectionist like Sukorov have to resist the temptation to yell ""Cut!"" to his actors and crew?  It's truly amazing to see just how beautifully planned and flawlessly executed the final product turns out to be, especially the ball sequence at the end which features hundreds of dancers and spectators who are set in beautifully choreographed and constantly whirling motion.  What's most remarkable is how much of a participant the camera itself is in the proceedings.  Not content to stand idly by and observe the scene like some passive onlooker, the camera moves right into the center of the action, gliding in and out of the crowds with utmost grace and precision.  Visually, the film is stunning, with exquisite costumes and furnishings as far as the eye can see.  Indeed, ""Russian Ark"" is, among other things, a veritable feast for the eyes, the likes of which we have rarely seen on film before.""Russian Ark"" does have something of a ""plot,"" involving a narrator whom we never see, a 21st Century filmmaker - we assume it's Sukorov himself - who's found himself inexplicably caught in some type of time warp and magically transported to this strange spectral world.  There's also a bizarre European ""ghost"" figure from the unspecified past who comments - and occasionally attempts to intrude - on the actions taking place around him.  But these two characters are of far less interest to the audience than the aural and visual delights of the film itself.""Russian Ark"" is a wonder to behold, for it is much more than just an ""exercise,"" a ""gimmick,"" or even an ""antithesis"" to Eisenstein; it is a vibrant work of art that challenges the limits of its medium and reminds us of just what it is about movies that we love so much.",4,the anti-Eisenstein,1069459200,"11 22, 2003",2003,3353,"['history', 'cinema', 'Russians', 'who', 'are', 'generally', 'credited', 'elevating', 'film', 'editing', 'modern', 'art', 'form', 'ironic', 'strangely', 'fitting', 'therefore', 'should', 'be', 'Russians', 'who', 'almost', 'full', 'century', 'later', 'have', 'now', 'produced', 'first', 'full-length', 'feature', 'film', 'ever', 'be', 'composed', 'single', 'unedited', 'shot', 'running', 'uninterrupted', 'first', 'moment', 'last', 'Hitchcock', 'came', 'close', 'Rope', 'did', 'include', 'few', 'cuts', 'course', 'film', 'Even', 'Sergei', 'Eisenstein', 'who', 'films', 'Potemkin', 'Ten', 'Shook', 'World', 'spent', 'career', 'developing', 'demonstrating', 'power', 'editing', 'would', 'dare', 'say', 'be', 'impressed', 'Russian', 'Ark', 'film', 'bit', 'innovative', 'challenging', 'earlier', 'seminal', 'works.For', 'bravura', 'awe-inspiring', 'cinematic', 'tour-de-force', 'director', 'Alexander', 'Sokurov', 'cinematographer', 'Tilman', 'Buttner', 'take', 'famed', 'Hermitage', 'Museum', 'Winter', 'Palace', 'St.', 'Petersburg', 'providing', 'grand', 'tour', 'not', 'only', 'opulent', 'rooms', 'famous', 'artwork', 'contained', 'therein', '300', 'years', 'Russian', 'history', 'as', 'well', 'various', 'vignettes', 'involving', 'famous', 'people', 'Peter', 'Catherine', 'Great', 'Nicholas', 'Alexandra', 'events', 'are', 'played', 'out', 'glorious', 'gilded', 'walls', 'Russian', 'Ark', 'bold', 'audacious', 'project', 'cinematic', 'equivalent', 'breathlessly', 'performed', 'high', 'wire', 'juggling', 'act', 'know', 'one', 'false', 'move', 'part', 'actors', 'cameraman', 'one', 'missed', 'cue', 'accident', 'fate', 'could', 'bring', 'whole', 'delicately', 'poised', 'enterprise', 'crashing', 'down', 'How', 'often', 'one', 'wonders', 'did', 'perfectionist', 'Sukorov', 'have', 'resist', 'temptation', 'yell', 'Cut', 'actors', 'crew', 'truly', 'amazing', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'beautifully', 'planned', 'flawlessly', 'executed', 'final', 'product', 'out', 'be', 'especially', 'ball', 'sequence', 'end', 'hundreds', 'dancers', 'spectators', 'who', 'are', 'set', 'beautifully', 'choreographed', 'constantly', 'whirling', 'motion', 'What', 'most', 'remarkable', 'how', 'much', 'participant', 'camera', 'proceedings', 'Not', 'content', 'stand', 'idly', 'observe', 'scene', 'passive', 'onlooker', 'camera', 'right', 'center', 'action', 'gliding', 'crowds', 'utmost', 'grace', 'precision', 'Visually', 'film', 'stunning', 'exquisite', 'costumes', 'furnishings', 'as', 'far', 'eye', 'can', 'see', 'Indeed', 'Russian', 'Ark', 'other', 'things', 'veritable', 'feast', 'eyes', 'likes', 'have', 'rarely', 'seen', 'film', 'Russian', 'Ark', 'have', 'something', 'plot', 'involving', 'narrator', 'whom', 'never', 'see', '21st', 'Century', 'filmmaker', 'assume', 'Sukorov', 'who', 'found', 'inexplicably', 'caught', 'type', 'time', 'warp', 'magically', 'transported', 'strange', 'spectral', 'world', 'also', 'bizarre', 'European', 'ghost', 'figure', 'unspecified', 'past', 'who', 'comments', 'occasionally', 'attempts', 'intrude', 'actions', 'taking', 'place', 'two', 'characters', 'are', 'far', 'less', 'interest', 'audience', 'aural', 'visual', 'delights', 'film', 'Russian', 'Ark', 'wonder', 'behold', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'exercise', 'gimmick', 'even', 'antithesis', 'Eisenstein', 'vibrant', 'work', 'art', 'limits', 'medium', 'just', 'what', 'movies', 'love', 'so', 'much']",Russian Ark VHS

A phenomenal amount of time, energy, and money went into the production of this film. The cast included 867 trained actors plus more than a thousand extras and dozens of horses and carriages. Filmed in one continuous shot inside the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia, RUSSIAN ARK portrays 300 years of Russian history filmed in 33 museum rooms with three live orchestras. For ninety minutes the camera followed a man dressed in black who is product of the past. As he moves from gallery to gallery it is revealed from his dialogue that this man is a historical diplomat from France. He has much criticisms and critiques of Russian art and culture in contrast to Europe. Important moments of Russia's past are intertwined with the man's visit to the Hermitage. The past comes alive and the viewer is a voyeur to these historical events. I was fascinated and intrigued while watching this film as I was transported to the past.

The film had a surreal and dreamlike atmosphere which was created most effectively by the technical achievement that most critics didn't see past.Russian Ark provided the single longest uncut shot ever recorded on film (1 1/2 hours). The entire duration of the film was a masterfully choreographed tour through  a beautiful Russian museum which required thousands of actors and two failed attempts until the film was completed without mistake. This alone should be reason enough to pique any film lover's curiosity. However, Russian Ark offers so much more.Coming into the movie, I had very little knowledge of Russian history. This may have hindered me from understanding some of the characters portrayed in the film (although I did pick out some of the more prominent figures), but it certainly did not hinder me from becoming enraptured in such a rich and nostalgic journey through a bygone era.This may seem like a light enough concept, but the underlying tone of the film is one of sorrow. With every frame, the director (who is also the narrator of sorts and the main character) seems to ache for a present time that is as beautiful as he sees his country's history.A truly haunting film, as well as an astounding technical achievement, Russian Ark chooses to show what it misses about Russia's past, as opposed to telling what it dislikes about the country's present.

This will no doubt go down as a piece of cinematic history and will be reverred by film students and afficianados everywhere. Not only do we travel through 33 rooms of the Hermitage in St. Petersburg, seeing approximately 2,000 actors and extras, all in opulent, built-for-the -movie costumes, but this is filmed in only one continuous 90 minute take on a steady-cam. AND...they had only 36 hours to set up all the lights, props, etc. This is incredible. While we tour about 1 1/2 miles of this breathtaking museum and art collection, we also become acquainted with Russian history, the influence of Europe on Russian culture and a loose, ghostly framework of a story. But really, what's amazing is how this many people, no doubt mostly strangers, could be in the same mindframe for 1 1/2 hours to create this frozen moment in time. I strongly recommend the DVD due to the extras which explain the process and struggles, especially the poor cameraman who was in so much physical pain that he was on the brink of quitting 20 minutes before the end of the shoot.
