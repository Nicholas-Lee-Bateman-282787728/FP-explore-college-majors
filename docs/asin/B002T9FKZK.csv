1287905,A3LQDYVAAHHV2T,B002T9FKZK,FYI,"[5, 5]","This particular set of three mysteries features even more ale than usual, as an Oxfordshire brewery is the location for dark impulses. By now, you may want to try Morse's ""favourite"" food: Samuel Smith's ales. Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout is fine indeed, as is the rare, oak-aged Samuel Smith's Yorkshire Stingo (released every other year). Enjoy your vicarious, bubbly travels to England!The Sins of the Fathers: Inspector Morse investigates foul play at a family-run brewery called ""Radford Brewery."" Traditional, small business practices are challenged by a takeover bid by a huge multinational company. The murderer finds a terrible use for a beer vat. And by imbibing Samuel Smith's ales with Inspector Morse, we learned a new word: flocculent. A fine word, worthy of Morse's crossword puzzles.Driven to Distraction: How could anyone convince Morse he needs to sell his precious Mark II Jaguar? Devious tendrils of plot unfold as lovely young women are murdered, all connected to a covetous car dealer.Masonic Mysteries: Kevin Whately's (Sergeant Lewis) real-life wife Madelaine Newton plays the unfortunate victim this time, and who but Inspector Morse is at the top of the suspect-list! A dress rehearsal featuring Masonic costumes becomes a murder-zone.

1287906,A20FK68BUB1IVA,B002T9FKZK,Happy Reader,"[8, 8]","This is Set Five of eleven ""Inspector Morse"" Sets. Each Set has three episodes/discs. Don't confuse these eleven ""Sets"" with the previously issued (but still available) ""Collection Sets"". Each of the six ""Collection Sets"" cost more, as each has more episodes/discs than these Sets.Set Five has three episodes, excellent EXCELLENT episodes. They originally aired in January 1990, in the same order, as the last 3 episodes of the British Series 4. (In England, they call them ""series"" instead of ""seasons"".)Episodes:The Sins of the FathersDriven to DistractionMasonic MysteriesTHE SINS OF THE FATHERS:A man finishes typing a letter in his office. He scrunches up the carbon paper, throwing it away, and then burns another letter in an ashtray. As he leaves the office, he is attacked from behind. The next we see of him, it's his dead body, found the next day by a worker. Lewis rushes into Morse's office exclaiming, ""You'll never believe this, Sir. We have to visit a brewery!""They troop over to the Radford Brewery, a proud old name in the brewing business. Charles Radford tells them that his brother, the recently deceased Trevor Radford, had been working late on a ""defense document"". Farmers was bidding to take over the family-held brewery, and Trevor was against it. The police discover that the newly used carbon paper was of a letter dated 1986, four years before. Stranger still, when Morse goes to tell Trevor's wife there's bad news, she looks at him and asks, ""Someone died? Is it Charles?"" Now why would she worry first about Charles instead of Trevor?This story is a Greek tragedy, told with excellent acting, both understated and in-your-face.Trivia: This episode was written by Jeremy Burnham based on the characters created by Colin Dexter. Using an electric typewriter and carbon paper dates it. But that's the only thing that does, for it's a timeless tale of rotten family dynamics and secrets passed from parent to son.DRIVEN TO DISTRACTION:Chief Superintendent Strange (consistently marvelous performances by James Grout) is beside himself. There's been two similar brutal murders, and the police have no leads whatsoever. Now, the viewer knows who the killer is. Sort of. He wears old black leather gloves, drives a stickshift, keeps duct tape in his glove compartment, and plays the Cole Porter songs, ""You Do Something to Me"" and ""Why Can't You Behave"" while stalking his prey. Creepy.Persistence pays off, when the police discover that both women have one thing in common, a car dealership owned by the irksome Jeremy Boynton (played with slick menace by Patrick Malahide). Morse is so sure that Boynton's the murderer, he risks his career on harassing the dealer, and, at one point, Lewis says he just can't follow him there. Boy, this is a great episode.Trivia: This episode is written by Anthony Minghella based on the characters created by Colin Dexter. In ""The Story of Morse"", a 50 minute documentary special, Kevin Whately says, ""If we'd got on like a house on fire as characters, it would have made it dull and flat.""MASONIC MYSTERIES:It's full dress rehearsal night for the Oxford amateur production of ""The Magic Flute"". Morse is in the chorus, and he's driving in a hurry. His passenger, Beryl Newsome, is nervy because of his driving. Morse wants to get to know her better, but she's sharp with him, saying, ""I've just had enough of men for the moment."" Unfortunately, a fellow thespian, Sandra, is eavesdropping.After getting into their costumes, Beryl is called away for a phone call. At the same time, the dresser sends Morse back because he's missing his medallion, part of his costume. While Morse is backstage getting his medallion, Beryl is finding out that there's no one on the phone. ""Hello? Hello? Is anyone there?"" You're getting a bad feeling about this.Sure enough, not only is Beryl stabbed to death while holding the phone, but Morse is the one to find her. In his shock, he actually picks up the knife and gets bloody cradling her body. Naturally, Sandra is only too happy to tell the police that Morse appeared to be forcing his attentions on Beryl.To his anger, Morse is pulled off the case and is a suspect. Remember Morse's Law from ""The Silent World of Nicholas Quinn""? There's always a 50/50 chance that the man who found the body, did the deed. Lewis, however, is still on the case, working with Chief Inspector Bottomly. Bottomly talks to a very uncomfortable Lewis, ""Look Lewis... What's his, um, sex life been all these years? And, people do sometimes, suddenly, if they're disgruntled or humiliated, perhaps ... (pregnant pause) He drinks a lot, doesn't he?""Who is framing Morse?  Is it a nemesis from the past?  Because soon another person close to Morse is killed.Trivia: This episode was written by Julian Mitchell based on the characters created by Colin Dexter. Dexter has a walk-on as a member of the costumed chorus, standing next to Morse. Beryl Newsome is played by Madelaine Newton, who is Kevin Whately's real-life wife.",5,Morse is Wrong!

1287915,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B002T9FKZK,Z Hayes,"[0, 0]","I came to the Inspector Morse series by way of Inspector Lewis, and discovered that Kevin Whately (who is amazing as DI Lewis) also used to play DS Lewis in Inspector Morse. He is one of my favorite actors, and of course, John Thaw is one of my all-time favorite actors in investigative dramas. Thaw's Morse is compelling to watch - he loves listening to operatic music, enjoys his quality pint of ale, is easily smitten by a pretty face and intelligence, and is meticulous and astute in his deductive reasoning. All in all, Morse exemplifies the consummate detective, and most of the Morse episodes are of superior quality in terms of writing and acting.Set Five contains three episodes:The Sins of the FathersIn  almost every Morse episode, the crime committed is caused by baser human instincts be it sex, money, or greed, among others. A murder at a brewery sees Morse investigating the circumstances of a family-owned brewery which has fallen on hard times. Just as Morse feels he has a suspect in hand, another murder is committed followed by one more! Viewers get treated to watching a family unravel bit by bit - surprisingly it is not the deaths of loved ones that affect some of these family members but the horrifying prospect of having their dismal family finances made known to the public. Morse digs deep as he is determined to solve the murders and there is a nice little twist in this plot which made it even more engaging.Driven to DistractionThis is a thought-provoking episode, well more so than some of the other Morse episodes. When three women turn up murdered, Morse and his team try to find a clue that links all three, and discover that all three women had bought cars from the same auto dealer. Morse lets his own prejudices against the auto dealer affect his judgment and this costs him when Superintendent Strange pulls him off the case. Even Lewis refuses to go along with Morse. This episode reveals the flaws in Morse as a man and as an investigator and is quite a sobering episode.Masonic Mysteries""Masonic Mysteries"" is an unusual episode in the Inspector Morse series as Morse (brilliantly portrayed by John Thaw) is the one that is the hunted and persecuted. While rehearsing for an amateur theatrical production of The Magic Flute, Chief Inspector Morse's lady friend Beryl Newsome (played by Kevin Whately's aka DS Lewis' real-life wife, Madelaine Newton) is found stabbed to death. Her body is found by Morse himself, and soon Morse becomes the chief suspect in the case.DS Lewis who is now assigned to assist another Chief Inspector, finds himself struggling to help Morse even as evidence points to Morse as the killer. Soon enough though, it becomes apparent that Morse is being set up by a criminal Morse helped put away years ago, a criminal so attuned to Morse's every move, familiar with Morse's favorite haunts, passions, etc. that Morse finds his life a living hell, exactly what the criminal wants.There are parts of the show that tend to get overly dramatic and a tad exaggerated, especially in the scenes where the loony criminal is featured. Yet John Thaw and his incredible performance as Morse makes it all worthwhile. This is also one of the episodes that best captures the close bond and unwavering loyalty and respect that Lewis has for his Inspector, and where Morse grudgingly acknowledges Lewis' competence!",5,John Thaw provides a flawless performance as the meticulous Insp.
