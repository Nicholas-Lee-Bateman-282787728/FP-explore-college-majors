""1 2 3 Count With Me"" a much better choice, for us at least, and possibly for all 2 year olds. Could be ""learning about numbers"" is better tolerated by older children. Only weakness to ""1 2 3 count with me"" is that they give short shrift or even skip over certain numbers between 1-20. Some kind of brainless editing decision by somebody who didn't get enought sleep, no doubt. but our child much preferred it to ""learning about numbers"" Also: ""learning about numbers"" subjects you to a hyperactive commercial for some Sesame Street foundation at the beginning and doesn't let you bypass it!",2,"our toddler much preferred ""1 2 3 count with me""",1202860800,"02 13, 2008",2008,1298,"['two-and-a-half', 'year', 'old', 'did', ""n't"", 'learning', 'numbers', 'one', 'little', 'sequence', 'show', '2', 'girls', 'playing', 'dollhouse', 'much', 'preferred', '1', '2', '3', 'count', 'two', 'dvds', 'are', 'actually', 'quite', 'different', 'other', 'one', 'elmo', 'ernie', 'feels', 'very', 'much', 'geared', 'young', 'children', 'learning', 'numbers', 'actually', 'were', 'trying', 'entertain', 'children', 'adults', 'same', 'time', 'adopting', 'mock', 'talk', 'show', 'format', 'where', 'big', 'bird', 'supposed', 'be', 'kind', 'jay', 'leno', 'standup', 'lot', 'Count', 'LAN', 'toddler', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'kind', 'dracula', 'knockoff', 'struck', 'kind', 'distasteful', 'even', 'scary', '1', '2', '3', 'Count', 'Me', 'much', 'better', 'choice', 'least', 'possibly', '2', 'year', 'olds', 'Could', 'be', 'learning', 'numbers', 'better', 'tolerated', 'older', 'children', 'Only', 'weakness', '1', '2', '3', 'count', 'give', 'short', 'shrift', 'even', 'skip', 'certain', 'numbers', '1-20', 'kind', 'brainless', 'editing', 'decision', 'somebody', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'enought', 'sleep', 'doubt', 'child', 'much', 'preferred', 'learning', 'numbers', 'Also', 'learning', 'numbers', 'subjects', 'hyperactive', 'commercial', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'foundation', 'beginning', ""n't"", 'let', 'bypass']",Sesame Street - Learning About Numbers VHS

You will recognize many of the songs and skits.  No, it is not as flashy and digital as modern Sesame Street, but that's a good thing, in my opinion.  If your children watch a lot of TV, their attention span might not allow them to watch this video.  If you prefer to use TV/videos sparingly, like we do, your kids will love it as much as you will.
