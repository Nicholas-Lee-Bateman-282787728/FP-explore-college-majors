So I ordered the DVD.Well I am a fan of the character development of the original movie, the lovely choreography and the interplay. None of that is in this movie. The choreography - no real attention was given to this. The characters were mostly flat and the lead female really didn't move me when she danced, be it in the club or on the floor. The two male character from the first movie - where pretty much an expanded cameo. The blonde dancer did pretty much the same routine from the first movie...with the same expertise, but seemed to lack passion.

1207355,A3BWP965RIWBCU,B001K2LFNI,"Gerald Parker ""Gerald Parker""","[0, 0]","""Centre Stage: Turn It up"" is a worthy sequel to the first ""Center [i.e., Centre] Stage"" film (the earlier one subtitled ""Life Doesn`t Hold Tryouts""), but not quite of the same level of interest either as drama or as dance. There is more dance of modern pop styles (rap, hip-hop) in this nice sequel than there is ballet, though both are present in the two films, the difference in that regard being one of balance. Ballet (and some glamourous Hollywood/Broadway show dancing, too) is more prominent in the original (i.e., in ""Life Doesn`t Hold Tryouts""), with much more dancing of all styles in that film by the entrancing Ethan Stiefel, who, however, does enough dancing in ""Turn It up"", in classical and pop styles, to justify obtaining the second DVD as well as the first, which had been, however, more of a showcase for him.The storyline of ""Turn It up"" is not quite so engrossing as that of the interweaving plot constituents of ""Life Doesn`t Hold Tryouts"", but the later motion picture does hold the interest between the dance sequences, which are well integrated into the plot. Kenny Wormald, the the adorably boyish and muscular principal male protagonist in ""Turn It up"", is a fine dancer in his own right; it is his acting that is not quite so up to the level of that of the delightfully insouciant and self-confidently genial Ethan Stiefel, who, fortunately, is in both movies (and in ""Life Doesn`t Hold Tryouts"" as the main male figure of that film).My recommendation is to buy both ""Centre Stage"" films, if one really has a passion for dance in all of its forms, as I do. If star calibre acting and dancing is the shopper's overridingly chief interest, then the first film is the more essential of the two to purchase for his personal collection.",4,"A Good Sequel to ""Centre Stage: Life Doesn`t Hold Try-outs"" but a Film of Somewhat Different Dance Orientation",1324857600,"12 26, 2011",2011,1760,"['Centre', 'Stage', 'Turn', 'up', 'worthy', 'sequel', 'first', 'Center', '[', 'i.e.', 'Centre', ']', 'Stage', 'film', 'earlier', 'one', 'subtitled', 'Life', 'Doesn', 't', 'Hold', 'Tryouts', 'not', 'quite', 'same', 'level', 'interest', 'drama', 'dance', 'more', 'dance', 'modern', 'pop', 'styles', 'rap', 'hip-hop', 'nice', 'sequel', 'ballet', 'are', 'present', 'two', 'films', 'difference', 'regard', 'being', 'one', 'balance', 'Ballet', 'glamourous', 'Hollywood/Broadway', 'show', 'dancing', 'too', 'more', 'prominent', 'original', 'i.e.', 'Life', 'Doesn', 't', 'Hold', 'Tryouts', 'much', 'more', 'dancing', 'styles', 'film', 'entrancing', 'Ethan', 'Stiefel', 'who', 'however', 'enough', 'dancing', 'Turn', 'up', 'classical', 'pop', 'styles', 'justify', 'obtaining', 'second', 'DVD', 'as', 'well', 'first', 'had', 'been', 'however', 'more', 'showcase', 'him.The', 'storyline', 'Turn', 'up', 'not', 'quite', 'so', 'engrossing', 'interweaving', 'plot', 'constituents', 'Life', 'Doesn', 't', 'Hold', 'Tryouts', 'later', 'motion', 'picture', 'hold', 'interest', 'dance', 'sequences', 'are', 'well', 'integrated', 'plot', 'Kenny', 'Wormald', 'adorably', 'boyish', 'muscular', 'principal', 'male', 'protagonist', 'Turn', 'up', 'fine', 'dancer', 'own', 'right', 'acting', 'not', 'quite', 'so', 'up', 'level', 'delightfully', 'insouciant', 'self-confidently', 'genial', 'Ethan', 'Stiefel', 'who', 'fortunately', 'movies', 'Life', 'Doesn', 't', 'Hold', 'Tryouts', 'main', 'male', 'figure', 'film', '.My', 'recommendation', 'buy', 'Centre', 'Stage', 'films', 'one', 'really', 'passion', 'dance', 'forms', 'do', 'star', 'calibre', 'acting', 'dancing', 'shopper', 'overridingly', 'chief', 'interest', 'then', 'first', 'film', 'more', 'essential', 'two', 'purchase', 'personal', 'collection']",Center Stage: Turn It Up
1207356,ALLJT7S5QOFFZ,B001K2LFNI,kaduzy,"[14, 16]","My favorite guilty pleasure movie obsession is dance films.  I will watch pretty much any lousy movie featuring dancing in its main plot, no matter what kind of dancing it is.  These movies all tend to be unimaginative and formulaic, but sometimes they manage to surprise you with decent acting performances and AMAZING dance performances.  One of these surprisingly good flicks is the original ""Center Stage"" -- so when I heard that there was a direct to DVD sequel, I knew I had to rent it.The plot of this movie is very different from the first one, which is a breath of fresh air.  As fans of the first flick know, Jodi Sawyer made it into the American Ballet Academy by the skin of her teeth, then ultimately proved that by mixing passion and modern dance steps in with ballet, she had what it took to be a star in arrogant ""ballerino"" Cooper Nielson's new company.  This time around, Cooper can't save the star, because his company has run out of funding, putting him right back at ABA as an instructor.  And the girl we follow this time is, like Jodi was, a dancer who lacks technical skill but has lots of passion.  This time, however, she doesn't make it.  Perhaps that's because she auditions directly for (even more arrogant) company director Jonathan Reeves, instead of his representatives.  That's a great scene, because it allows us to see the cold, stark reality of hiring dancers, and keeping a company alive.This movie is filled with good dance scenes and decent acting, as it melds ""street"" dancing with ballet, and shows us Kate's journey after her devastating rejection.  The director wanted to make the film seem less formal than the first one, so he uses a lot of hand-held camera moves that make the frames off-center, or shows us the dancers in reflection as they perform.  Call me old-fashioned, but I prefer that the camera be left alone during dance movies, so that I can follow the performance in full.Speaking of performances -- that is where this movie really falls short compared to the last one.  Despite the fact that its only major improvement over the last one is that they hired a full cast of dancers (meaning that unlike the first movie, there's never a need to cut away from an actor who clearly cannot do his or her own dancing) this movie has no GREAT dance performances.  Just good ones.  The finale is especially disappointing compared to finale of the original.  That was a ten-minute, all out, full-on dance spectacular, with great pop music, great costumes, a great story -- and even greater dance moves.  This one is just . . . okay.  Nothing special.  It seems like such a sad waste of such an obviously talented cast.  Perhaps part of the reason is that, according to one of the extras, they only had four days to learn ALL the choreography for the entire movie.  That elevates the dancing in this sequel from good to impressive, but it's still disappointing that they couldn't get enough rehearsal time to really live up to the original.The extras consist of two making-of featurettes, and an ungodly amount of trailers.  Seriously, I have *NEVER* seen so many trailers included in one movie before.  It's absurd.  Overall, this DVD is worth a rental, and is a must-see for fans of the original, if only because you get to watch Cooper Nielson dance hip-hop!  But I wouldn't recommend that anyone purchase it, because it just isn't the kind of movie you can watch over and over again, noticing new things about the dance performances every time.  Instead, go ahead and pop in the first one.

1207360,A2X9AXCWH4MT4I,B001K2LFNI,"Marcy G. ""MarcyG""","[21, 22]","I enjoy dance movies and have the first ""Center Stage"" on dvd. I wasn't sure what to expect from the sequel but decided to check it out when it premiered in Oxygen channel. I found myself hooked within the first 10 minutes. Kenny Wormald and Rachele Brooke Smith are attractive and talented young actors who do a great job of carrying this movie. Both actors are clearly cast for their dancing and athletic abilities, as well as their good looks, and for novice actors, they do a creditable job.The story centers around Kate Parker (Smith) and Tommy Anderson (Wormald). Kate dreams of attending the American Ballet School in NYC but unfortunately doesn't make the cut at audition. Tommy - a former hockey player turned ballet dancer - gets in. When Tommy spots Kate at the audition, sparks fly. Dejected Kate takes a job at a bar/dance club that is owned by Tommy's friend and Tommy falls for Kate.  Tommy offers to help Kate improve her ballet skills, while Kate helps Tommy improve his ""hip/hop-street dance"" skills. They hit it off and fall in love. Conflicts arise when Tommy's wealthy classmate Suzanne (Sarah Jensen) gets in the way and Kate is torn between her fear of rejection (as she plans to re-audition for ABS) and her dreams of being a ballerina.If you love dance movies like ""Center Stage,"" ""Step Up"" and ""Save the Last Dance,"" then this movie is for you. The dancing is more of a blend of the first ""Center Stage"" and ""Step Up"" with ballet moves mixed in with hip-hop/street dance. Both leads are very talented and live up to the demands of the complex dance routines. Smith started out as a gymnast and it shows.  She is also charming and lights up the screen with her big smile and gorgeous eyes. Wormald was a back-up dancer for Justin Timberlake and was in the reality series ""Dancelife."" With his brown eyes and intense stare, he is definitely swoon-worthy.Back from the first ""Center Stage"" are Peter Gallagher (in the same role) and Ethan Stieffel (Cooper Nelson - now an instructor), but don't expect Amanda Schull and Sasha Radensky from the first film. In all honesty, the new leads are interesting enough to hold the story so I spent little time regretting their absence.  The music blends well with the storyline and the dancing is superb.If you're going in expecting to see a good made-for-tv movie with great dancing, attractive and talented leads and an engaging storyline, then you won't be disappointed.  Think of it as ""Center Stage"" meets ""Step Up"" with a bit of ""Flashdance"" sprinkled in and you're all set. For my part, I enjoyed it and certainly plan to purchase the dvd when it comes out. And if they ever do release the soundtrack, then I'll be in line to buy that, too.",5,A pleasant surprise.

What I got was the opposite.  The first Center Stage was more of an introspective look at the various types of dancers that attend an academy as prestigious and as pressure filled as The American Ballet Academy.  It also shows to some degree what those dancers go through to achieve their goals and how for whatever reasons they are or aren't suited to be professional dancers.  This film, while the dancing was great, was nothing more than a knock-off of the very first Step Up film and that was all it was.  The only difference is the person that wants to make it is a girl instead of a guy and the dancer wants to get into the American Ballet Academy.  The acting was okay and the choreography was decent, but that is about all this film has going for it.  Unless a person seriously loves the first Step Up film I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone who is expecting a film like the first Center Stage.
