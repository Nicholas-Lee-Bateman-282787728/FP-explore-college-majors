Keable ""more bass!""","[1, 1]","The phrase ""you can never go back"" is usually very true, especially when applied to musical groups getting back together, but thankfully not in this case.  I read that their Japanese fan base had something to do with them reuniting (or at least performing in Japan first), but whatever the impetus..... hooray!  You just can't say enough superlatives about these guys.  They are one of my favorite groups ever (along with Kings X), and I couldn't wait to hear this, and see the DVD.  The first thing that jumped out at me was the vocal harmonies.  They've always had good harmonies, but now it seems to have gone to another level, truly stunning.  And captured in a live setting, no less (not sweetened in post, I hope).Two new gems are presented in both live and studio (bonus) versions.  I liked the studio version of ""Next Time Around"" better (the tour is named for this track).  Its live counterpart didn't seem as strong as the other material around it.  The live version of ""Hold Your Head Up"" however (yes, the Argent chestnut) was much stronger than the studio version.  Live they do a three or four-part vocal harmony on the first line of each verse that isn't on the studio piece, and it really adds to the arrangement.  And it's Paul doing the high falsetto part during each chorus, which surprised me as I thought it was usually Pat that handled the high end of the vocals.Another truly stunning piece is their live covering of Three Dog Night's ""It's For You"", and they do it as a trio without Eric!  Flawless soaring harmonies, and one of the highlights of the show for me.And of course there's plenty of Paul's and Billy's remarkable axemanship that once again shows each of them to be two of the finest players ever on guitar and bass.Each of the four has done mutiple solo albums over the last several years, and I can attest to all of them being very nice, worth a listen, but no doubt about it, a Mr. Big record just blows all that away.  They are just magic together, and I sincerely hope this is just the start of their ""next time around"".",5,A welcome return,1268956800,"03 19, 2010",2010,2060,"['phrase', 'can', 'never', 'go', 'back', 'usually', 'very', 'true', 'especially', 'when', 'applied', 'musical', 'groups', 'getting', 'back', 'together', 'thankfully', 'not', 'case', 'read', 'Japanese', 'fan', 'base', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'reuniting', 'least', 'performing', 'Japan', 'first', 'whatever', 'impetus', '..', 'hooray', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'superlatives', 'guys', 'are', 'one', 'favorite', 'groups', 'ever', 'Kings', 'X', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'hear', 'see', 'DVD', 'first', 'thing', 'jumped', 'out', 'was', 'vocal', 'harmonies', ""'ve"", 'always', 'had', 'good', 'harmonies', 'now', 'have', 'gone', 'level', 'truly', 'stunning', 'captured', 'live', 'setting', 'less', 'not', 'sweetened', 'post', 'hope', '.Two', 'new', 'gems', 'are', 'presented', 'live', 'studio', 'bonus', 'versions', 'liked', 'studio', 'version', 'Next', 'Time', 'Around', 'better', 'tour', 'named', 'track', 'live', 'counterpart', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'as', 'strong', 'other', 'material', 'live', 'version', 'Hold', 'Head', 'Up', 'however', 'yes', 'Argent', 'chestnut', 'was', 'much', 'stronger', 'studio', 'version', 'Live', 'do', 'three', 'four-part', 'vocal', 'harmony', 'first', 'line', 'verse', ""n't"", 'studio', 'piece', 'really', 'arrangement', 'Paul', 'doing', 'high', 'falsetto', 'part', 'chorus', 'surprised', 'thought', 'was', 'usually', 'Pat', 'handled', 'high', 'end', 'vocals.Another', 'truly', 'stunning', 'piece', 'live', 'covering', 'Three', 'Dog', 'Night', 'do', 'trio', 'Eric', 'Flawless', 'soaring', 'harmonies', 'one', 'highlights', 'show', 'me.And', 'course', 'plenty', 'Paul', 'Billy', 'remarkable', 'axemanship', 'once', 'again', 'be', 'two', 'finest', 'players', 'ever', 'guitar', 'bass.Each', 'four', 'done', 'mutiple', 'solo', 'albums', 'last', 'several', 'years', 'can', 'attest', 'being', 'very', 'nice', 'listen', 'doubt', 'Mr.', 'Big', 'record', 'just', 'away', 'are', 'just', 'magic', 'together', 'sincerely', 'hope', 'just', 'start', 'next', 'time', 'around']",N/A

Lee ""paradoxguy""","[2, 2]","When I was still in medical school, Mr. Big's debut album was released and I heard ""Addicted to that Rush"" on MTV, and thought it was an interesting song that displayed the band's instrumental chops well.  However, a couple of years later, ""To Be With You"" made it big and I thought ""too bad, Mr. Big has become another big hair band with a sensitive power ballad"", and lost track of them until I happened to see this DVD while browsing eBay.  The price was right, so I thought it would be worth purchasing to see how time has treated them.  The band looks and sounds much more vibrant than I anticipated and their covers are outstanding.  I was pleasantly surprised to hear how strong their harmonies are, which are especially well-displayed by their more melodic songs, such as ""To Be With You"", ""It's For You"", and ""Wild World"" (the last two notably are covers).  The instrumental chops are all intact and all members look like they are genuinely having fun.  Pat Torpey, the drummer, especially can't seem to stop smiling and grinning during most of the show.  ""Addicted to that Rush"" and ""Daddy, Brother, Lover, Little Boy"" sound great, as do the Paul Gilbert guitar solos.  The only downside is most of their originals are not particularly memorable.  For a band that's touted as treating songs with the same priority as their instrumental chops, the songs were not as good as advertised.  However, as ""Addicted to That Rush"", ""Daddy, Brother, Lover, Little Boy"", and ""To Be With You"" show, the band is capable of writing strong material and hopefully, if they record another studio album as rumored, their material will be stronger and more memorable.  The instrumental switch-off during ""Smoke on the Water"" is very entertaining; I didn't realize how strong a drummer Paul Gilbert is and Billy Sheehan can certainly play smoking riffs on electric guitar.  Eric Martin can play passable rhythm guitar, but I suspect Pat Torpey's musicianship is limited to drums; during the acoustic set, he used the acoustic guitar he was holding as a percussive instrument and seemed to be miming the bass rather than actually playing it during ""Smoke on the Water"".The band has aged well; Sheehan is already in his mid-50's, Eric Martin and Pat Torpey are almost 50, and Paul Gilbert is the young one at 42-43 (at time of the show), but their vibrancy and energy are those of much younger.Overall this DVD is very entertaining and fun and recommended for anyone who likes strong ensembles, harmonies, and musicianship.",4,An old newbie likes this DVD,1279584000,"07 20, 2010",2010,2511,"['When', 'was', 'still', 'medical', 'school', 'Mr.', 'Big', 'debut', 'album', 'was', 'released', 'heard', 'Addicted', 'Rush', 'MTV', 'thought', 'was', 'interesting', 'song', 'displayed', 'band', 'instrumental', 'chops', 'well', 'However', 'couple', 'years', 'later', 'Be', 'made', 'big', 'thought', 'too', 'bad', 'Mr.', 'Big', 'become', 'big', 'hair', 'band', 'sensitive', 'power', 'ballad', 'lost', 'track', 'happened', 'see', 'DVD', 'browsing', 'eBay', 'price', 'was', 'right', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'worth', 'purchasing', 'see', 'how', 'time', 'treated', 'band', 'much', 'more', 'vibrant', 'anticipated', 'covers', 'are', 'outstanding', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'hear', 'how', 'strong', 'harmonies', 'are', 'are', 'especially', 'well-displayed', 'more', 'melodic', 'songs', 'such', 'Be', 'Wild', 'World', 'last', 'two', 'notably', 'are', 'covers', 'instrumental', 'chops', 'are', 'intact', 'members', 'look', 'are', 'genuinely', 'having', 'fun', 'Pat', 'Torpey', 'drummer', 'especially', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'stop', 'smiling', 'grinning', 'most', 'show', 'Addicted', 'Rush', 'Daddy', 'Brother', 'Lover', 'Little', 'Boy', 'sound', 'great', 'do', 'Paul', 'Gilbert', 'guitar', 'solos', 'only', 'downside', 'most', 'originals', 'are', 'not', 'particularly', 'memorable', 'band', 'touted', 'treating', 'songs', 'same', 'priority', 'instrumental', 'chops', 'songs', 'were', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'advertised', 'However', 'Addicted', 'Rush', 'Daddy', 'Brother', 'Lover', 'Little', 'Boy', 'Be', 'show', 'band', 'capable', 'writing', 'strong', 'material', 'hopefully', 'record', 'studio', 'album', 'rumored', 'material', 'will', 'be', 'stronger', 'more', 'memorable', 'instrumental', 'switch-off', 'Smoke', 'Water', 'very', 'entertaining', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'how', 'strong', 'drummer', 'Paul', 'Gilbert', 'Billy', 'Sheehan', 'can', 'certainly', 'play', 'smoking', 'riffs', 'electric', 'guitar', 'Eric', 'Martin', 'can', 'play', 'passable', 'rhythm', 'guitar', 'suspect', 'Pat', 'Torpey', 'musicianship', 'limited', 'drums', 'acoustic', 'set', 'used', 'acoustic', 'guitar', 'was', 'holding', 'percussive', 'instrument', 'seemed', 'be', 'miming', 'bass', 'rather', 'actually', 'playing', 'Smoke', 'Water', '.The', 'band', 'aged', 'well', 'Sheehan', 'already', 'mid-50', 'Eric', 'Martin', 'Pat', 'Torpey', 'are', 'almost', '50', 'Paul', 'Gilbert', 'young', 'one', '42-43', 'time', 'show', 'vibrancy', 'energy', 'are', 'much', 'younger.Overall', 'DVD', 'very', 'entertaining', 'fun', 'recommended', 'anyone', 'who', 'strong', 'ensembles', 'harmonies', 'musicianship']",N/A

Barrows,"[2, 2]","I agree with the first review and will add that if you think these guys are one-hit wonders (To Be With You) from the hair metal days, think again. Time apart has only allowed them to hone their skills and come back bigger, badder and better than ever. The cover of Argent's Hold Your Head Up is great and fits in with the other classic rock covers they've done in the past and still include in their shows. What really caught my ear were the attention to harmonies they demonstrate here. All 4 of the guys sing and are able to pull off some really cool harmonizing including a cover of It's For You (a song The Beatles wrote but never recorded). Of course the respective solo sections are incredible as always and Paul seems to have toned down his section to focus more on dueling on dual-necked guitar and bass with Billy (outstanding arrangement) instead of just shredding to show how quick he is - although he doesn't disappoint in that area either. Torpey's drum solo is different from what you might expect as he does a lot of work on the rims of the drums. The guys even do some acoustics on a small stage that runs out in the middle of the crowd with Wild World being a particular standout.

All four members of Mr Big are amazing talents and this awesome DVD captures Paul Gilbert shredding with precision, Billy Sheehan matching it all on bass, Pat Torpey nailing some amazing drum grooves, and Eric Martin leading it all on vocals. On top of all this talent the entire band can sing and the four part harmonies on display here are simply killer. There is also an amazing section where the band members trade instruments and perform the Deep Purple classic ""Smoke On The Water"" at a level that most bands only dream of. The song selection at this show is simply awesome including songs from all eras of their career including ""Daddy, Brother, Lover, Little Boy"", ""Green Tinted Sixities Mind"", ""Alive And Kicking"", ""Just Take My Heart"", ""Rock & Roll Over"", ""Addicted To That Rush"", and ""Collorado Bulldog"".
