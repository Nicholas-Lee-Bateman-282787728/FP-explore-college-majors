84597,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,0788867164,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[4, 5]","Did you hate the first season of Grey's Anatomy just as much as I did?  Did you find yourself thinking that this series couldn't go any further than one season because of the dismal characters that seem to have life handed to them with a silver spoon, the love triangles that seemed forced, and the overbearing lisp that each character seemed to allow (i.e. I mean they all had character traits that dug deep under your fingernails)?  Did you finish the first season and say to yourself ""Thankfully that is over...""?  If you did, don't worry, I was one of those naysayers as well.  To quote my own review of this opening series,""Grey's Anatomy is a painful show. There are characters that you will love (the ""Nazi"" seems more real than anyone else on the show), the jokes will make you smile occasionally, and the intensity of being a first year doctor is obviously in place, but where Grey's Anatomy fails is the originality. This is not original programming. Using the season finale cliffhanger as an example, we, as a society of television watchers, have seen this all before. The ""shock"" of the final episode did nothing for me.""""I thought Grey's Anatomy played it safe. The characters will not instantly attract you, but by the end of the first season there is a small spark in their eyes. I will denounce the originality of this show because ... well ... there wasn't any. The actors surrounding the characters were amateur at best, not quite grasping a character as a whole, but instead playing whatever had to be done for the immediate episode.""As you can see, I didn't like the show.  Well, here I am, with my hand in the air, quick to applaud the writers of this show that read these words and stepped their program up at least 110%.  If you hated the first season, shuttering at its mediocrity, then I believe that you will love the second season.  The characters, as well as the storylines, seem to have been miraculously reborn.  The cliffhanger at the end of the first season lead a typical viewer to believe that episodes chalk full of clich&eacute;s would be sure to come, but what we didn't expect was the anger, the emotion, the level of humanity, and the dedication to take this show out of the altruistic rut that was so centralized in the first season, as well as just the random storylines that remind us of the horrors and sadness that happen behind hospital doors.  I, sounding rather shocked with myself, couldn't put this second season down.  Grey's Anatomy easily falls into the addiction category of DVD television, once you stop you just cannot stop, and soon it is three in the morning and work is about to call your name.  That, my friends, is an addiction.I do also want to state that this show wasn't without its flaws.  Some side stories became annoying and felt a bit prolonged (i.e. the Izzy story with her heart transplant patient - the season shocker) or even the choice of girlfriends that George happened to stumble upon after that horrific night.  Maybe I was too dedicated to the show, but these small things could have been easily removed to allow for stronger stories to help develop the characters.  Easily, this was the season to rediscover the characters.  I loved the dynamics between Burke and Christina followed by the chemistry between Burke and George.  One of my favorite episodes dealt with George not crossing the picket line when the nurses went on strike, it showed more about him than a single dramatic surgery could have.  The bullet wound for the police officer in the broken elevator made us see Alex in a new light, while overall, for the entire season, the ""Pink Mist"" two-part episode was the best that television could offer.  The blend of characters, horror, realization of life, and music (these two episodes were aptly named ""It's The End of the World"" and ""As We Know It"" ... an obvious homage to the classic R.E.M. song) created a stronger show that built upon a stronger viewer base.  This show gained popularity in season two, and watching it all on DVD, you can see why.  My personal thought is because of the music.  This season reminded me of Zach Braff and his talent towards finding just the right blend of independent music to fit the mood of the program.  I wouldn't be surprised if his hand was somewhere in the mix.The music, the direction, the power of these newfound characters all helped build Grey's Anatomy back up from a level that I thought would have caused it to end midway through the second season.  I had no hope for this show, now; I cannot wait to get my eyes on the third season.  Something happened between the first and second season, and I cannot applaud the change enough.  For those that were hesitant to go into this amazing second season due to a luke warm response from the first season, I am here to say give it an attempt.  I think you will love it, and discover why Grey's Anatomy is a step above those other programs on television.  I loved it, and while it wasn't perfect, it did provide endless hours of drama, humor, and some wondering love triangles.Keep it going Grey's Anatomy this second season you have raised the bar very high!Grade: **** out of *****",4,This season is very McAddictive...,1161302400,"10 20, 2006",2006,5168,"['Did', 'hate', 'first', 'season', 'Grey', 'Anatomy', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'Did',

However the show does not only focus on these two characters, for Christina, George, Isobel and Alex are placed in situations where they have to evaluate their aspirations, motives, and ethics.

With the lone exception of the charmingly irascible Dr. Bailey, every doctor who is on screen for more than 5 minutes has slept with a colleague, often a boss or subordinate.Doctors chide and insult each other and parade their sexual escapades and love frustrations in front of their patients, occasionally as a patient keels over from lack of attention.  If you think these doctors are busy, my Lord . . . can you imagine the workload in the legal department?  (There's got to be another whole drama concept sitting there ripe for the picking.)After a season and a half of this, why was I still surprised when the comely intern Izzie climbed into bed alongside a patient and giggled as he talked about groping her?  Sure, she knows her supervisor would disapprove.  But, hey . . . what self-respecting intern could be expected to subordinate their own needs and desires to professional ethics?  Can you believe those ponderous old bureaucrats who still preach such quaint notions to people as important as DOCTORS?  And Alex, that hunky little pack of randy medical manliness . . . why should anyone of his elevated sense of self-serving ethics have to obey orders not to spout off condescending insults to patients? The truth shall make you free.  His truth, anyway.These aren't just interns.  They are hip TV interns.  And this isn't just a hospital.  It's home to these hipsters.  And it's an anything-goes type of home where an orthopedic doctor lives in a basement storeroom, just because she wants to.  Its beds, lockerrooms, hallways, operating rooms, and elevators just seem built for chance encounters, sexual imbroglios, heated interchanges, embarassing standoffs, and kissing and making up.Actually, the show is great fun.  I've watched the first two seasons in the span of a couple of weeks.

Hinton ""avid reader""","[4, 4]","After last season's cliffhanger with Meredith learning Dr. McDreamy was married, I couldn't wait for the second season DVDs to arrive. I wasn't disappointed.This season picks up where the last left off beginning with the introduction of Kate Walsh as Dr. Addison Montgomery Shepherd. When Meredith is already feeling like a dirty whore for sleeping with a married man, she feels even worse upon learning that his wife is gorgeous, a renowned neonatal surgeon, and taking a position at Seattle Grace with every intention of fighting for her man.  And, as if the Meredith-McDreamy-Montgomery Shepherd triangle weren't enough, there's also the matter of Christina and Burke's budding relationship. Are they or aren't they together? Will they or won't they last? With Christina's headstrong nature and insistence on always being right and Burke's laid-back attitude and take life as it comes attitude, they're an interesting pair to say the least.  I was constantly wondering if they were going to make it. The outcome is still uncertain, but this season provided some much needed clarity.But by far the best storyline of the season came with the introduction of heart patient Denny Duquette, played by Jeffrey Dean Martin (one of my new favorite actors).  His relationship with intern Izzy Stevens is the stuff that television dramas are made for. I think you would have had to live under a rock not to have heard about the heart-stopping (literally) cliffhanger at the end of the two-part season finale and to have a heart made of stone not to have been torn up about the ending. Almost as much as I couldn't wait for this season to come on DVD, I couldn't wait for the third season to begin airing. And as always, this show hasn't disappointed me. In my opinion this is the best medical show on the air right now, bar none. For those who love House and ER and need a little levity in their television library, I'd suggest adding this show. And for anyone in the mood for an addictive drama-comedy with an incredible cast, I'd suggest it as well.",5,"The best medical show on television right now, bar none",1161907200,"10 27, 2006",2006,2044,"['last', 'season', 'cliffhanger', 'Meredith', 'learning', 'Dr.', 'McDreamy', 'was', 'married', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'second', 'season', 'DVDs', 'arrive', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed.This', 'season', 'up', 'where', 'last', 'left', 'off', 'beginning', 'introduction', 'Kate', 'Walsh', 'Dr.', 'Addison', 'Montgomery', 'Shepherd', 'When', 'Meredith', 'already', 'feeling', 'dirty', 'whore', 'sleeping', 'married', 'man', 'feels', 'even', 'worse', 'learning', 'wife', 'gorgeous', 'renowned', 'neonatal', 'surgeon', 'taking', 'position', 'Seattle', 'Grace', 'intention', 'fighting', 'man', 'Meredith-McDreamy-Montgomery', 'Shepherd', 'triangle', 'were', ""n't"", 'enough', 'also', 'matter', 'Christina', 'Burke', 'budding', 'relationship', 'Are', 'are', ""n't"", 'together', 'Will', 'wo', ""n't"", 'last', 'Christina', 'headstrong', 'nature', 'insistence', 'always', 'being', 'right', 'Burke', 'laid-back', 'attitude', 'take', 'life', 'attitude', ""'re"", 'interesting', 'pair', 'say', 'least', 'was', 'constantly', 'wondering', 'were', 'going', 'make', 'outcome', 'still', 'uncertain', 'season', 'provided', 'much', 'needed', 'clarity.But', 'far', 'best', 'storyline', 'season', 'came', 'introduction', 'heart', 'patient', 'Denny', 'Duquette', 'played', 'Jeffrey', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'one', 'new', 'favorite', 'actors', 'relationship', 'intern', 'Izzy', 'Stevens', 'stuff', 'television', 'dramas', 'are', 'made', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'live', 'rock', 'not', 'have', 'heard', 'heart-stopping', 'literally', 'cliffhanger', 'end', 'two-part', 'season', 'finale', 'have', 'heart', 'made', 'stone', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'torn', 'up', 'ending', 'as', 'much', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'season', 'come', 'DVD', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'third', 'season', 'begin', 'airing', 'always', 'show', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'opinion', 'best', 'medical', 'show', 'air', 'right', 'now', 'bar', 'none', 'who', 'love', 'House', 'ER', 'need', 'little', 'levity', 'television', 'library', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'adding', 'show', 'anyone', 'mood', 'addictive', 'drama-comedy', 'incredible', 'cast', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'as', 'well']",N/A

84661,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,0788867164,Linda Linguvic,"[0, 0]","Recently I watched the first season of this acclaimed TV series.  I  loved all nine episodes of it.  I just watched the second season, all 27 episodes of it, and loved it just as well.  The characters were familiar already and their personal stories told amidst the hospital medical dramas kept me glued to the TV as I watched it all on my brand new Roku.  The personal stories deepened and I picked my favorite characters.  I'm not particularly enhanced with Allison Grey.  She's just too whiney for my taste.  And the plot twist which now includes her former lover's wife becomes a little too hackneyed.  My favorite character by far is Chandra Wilson as Dr. Bailey;  her grit and gumption is unchallenged.

I am pretty sure you have already watched at least some episodes of the series, but missed others and want to make up for it with this dvd. If so, this is your chance, grab it! On the other case, if that is not the case and you are new to ""Grey's anatomy"", do yourself a favour and purchase first ""Grey's Anatomy - Season one"", in order to start watching this series by the beginning.Why should someone be interested in this series? Well, because it is engaging, can boast a great cast and an excellent script. What is more, it is about medical operations in a hospital, but also about the personal lives of the interns and attendings that work there. This series is about the main characters as doctors, but also as people with everyday problems, and their struggle to try to deal with them.In this second season every character has changed, and quite a few things are different. For example Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) has to face the fact that the man she loves, attending physician Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), has a wife she didn't know about, Dr. Addison (Kate Walsh). That hits her hard, and among other things she does to cope with that fact, Meredith ends up buying a dog. According to her, ""Four hundred years ago, another well-known English guy had an opinion about being alone. John Donne. He thought we were never alone. Of course, it was fancier when he said it. ""No man is an island entire unto himself."" Boil down that island talk, and he just meant that all anyone needs is someone to step in and let us know we're not alone. And who's to say that someone can't have four legs. Someone to play with or run around with, or just hang out"".Regarding the other interns, Izzy Stevens (Katherine Heigl), Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) and George O'Malley (T.R McKnight) will have quite a few more problems in their personal lives in this second season, but they will continue to grow as professionals. Christina Yang (Sandra Oh) will have some trouble dealing with her growing feelings for her lover, attending surgeon Preston Burke (Isiah Washington), and with the adjustments both need to make so that their relationship can work.""Grey's anatomy"" is the kind of show that is easy to recommend, as almost everybody will find something good in a show that entertains but also gives you some food for thought. I will finish this review quoting Meredith Grey, who says that ""At the end of the day, there are some things you just can't help but talk about. Some things we just don't want to hear, and some things we say because we can't be silent any longer. Some things are more than what you say, they're what you do. Some things you say cause there's no other choice. Some things you keep to yourself. And not too often, but every now and then, some things simply speak for themselves"".

I was not that involved with it even when Addison (Shepherd's wife) joined the show for the season premiere.

The whole Code Black situation mesmerized me like a moth to a flame. It was just great writing and acting. I loved it when Meredith took over the situation as Ellen Pompeo truly shined in this two-parter. Cristina and Dr. Bailey were also quite outstanding and they continued to be for the rest of the season. After ""It's The End Of The World Of The World"" and ""As We Know It"" episodes, this show became must-see TV for me. Also, ""you don't get to call me a whore!"" was another great episode. Every episode just got more captivating, it just got better and better and I could not be more invested. The 3-part season finale was just so great, it was such a pity that they did not get the Emmy for Best Drama because they truly deserved it just as much as 24 did.I never thought that I would be so devoted to a show more than DH which was the only reason I even knew about this show.

So to play catch up, I went and bought the first season on DVD. I was so impressed. This show is phenomenal. I love the characters, and even more, I love the divesity of the characters. I don't understand how on so many shows, there are no characters of ethnic persuasion. I mean com'mon, we are everywhere! And it's sad to see us not represented on the t.v. we watch. But, Grey's Anatomy has something for everybody. You can watch this show and identify with someone (I identify with Dr. Bailey). I also love the distinct personalities of each character, I mean I've had a doctor who was a jackass (aka Alex Carev), who hasn't?All in all, this show has restored my faith in good television and good writing. The OC's writer said that he killed of one off his main characters because he had no more stories to tell. As a writer I took offense to that. The stories are there, you just have to take the time to tell them. To me, when you stop caring about the characters you've created, then naturally their stories will die. The care is seen in every episode of Grey's Anatomy, the error and flaw of human imperfection and the glorious triumph of the human spirit.
