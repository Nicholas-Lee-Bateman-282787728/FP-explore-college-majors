I think it depicted quite well the problems of the young people in Russia, also the grim details of  the life of Russion people in general - drunkenness, rudeness, total lack  of culture, ignorance and so on.

The image of the East German female weightlifter who would put the Rock or Arnold Schwarzenegger to shame comes to mine.What made this movie interesting is that it was one of the first times where you could see Soviet women depicted as women, as well as the crushing poverty that many still face in the Former Soviet Union.If you are considering meeting and dating foreign women online then this is a recommended film for you.

Picketers surrounded cinemas protesting it, decrying the  morals-corrupting influence of depraved &quot;Western values&quot;.  Actually the sex scene is extremely tame by American standards.  What made  this film truly revolutionary was the heretofore prohibited portrayal of  toxic family life, including grinding poverty, alcoholism, domestic  violence, despair, and youthful rebellion.  The film may be  ground-breaking, but it is also ear-splitting in its stridency.  None of  the characters are likable enough to care about what happens to them.  As  other reviewers have mentioned, the acting is superb.

The state-run television station ran it one evening, and I watched it with my Russian friends, who insisted it was a ""porno"". After the movie, the same people who thought they'd be able to see explicit sex scenes ended up sitting around the kitchen table discussing the movie over vodka and pickles as if it were an obscure painting of the Peter and Paul Fortress.Whatever, the movie gave me, as a United States citizen, an insight on Russian family, lifestyle, fears and hopes. To many Russians, it seems they consider the film effluvium to be dismissed as they are probably used to so much state-sponsored affect flotsam and jetsam. But to some of us ""uneducated"", it was enlightening and funny/ironic toward the end, with that ""HAAA! HAAA!"" attempt at mental escape.Not to mention, Natalya Negoda is hot!

Little Vera is one result. The story of a young rebellious girl in a dysfunctional Russian family confronted with adult decisions.Natalya Negoda is wonderful as Vera, a confused and angry teenager growing into adulthood. Equally excellent is Yuri Nazarov as her alcoholic father. Vera self-destruction steers herself, her lover and the family into flurry of difficulties, including run-ins with police and pregnancy.This is one of the more realistic depictions of life in Russia that I've seen on film (though most Russian families aren't this dysfunctional). In the midst of Vera's calamities and rebellion we see some genuinely touching scenes with her father, who in spite of her shortcomings and his own alcoholism loves her.With excellent acting and directing, I highly recommend Little Vera.",5,A overlooked Russian film on youthful rebellion,1034121600,"10 9, 2002",2002,985,"['late', '80s', 'Gorbachev', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'most', 'film', 'took', 'advantage', 'liberalizing', 'climate', 'address', 'problems', 'realities', 'were', 'often', 'ignored', 'more', 'oppressive', 'times', 'Little', 'Vera', 'one', 'result', 'story', 'young', 'rebellious', 'girl', 'dysfunctional', 'Russian', 'family', 'confronted', 'adult', 'decisions.Natalya', 'Negoda', 'wonderful', 'Vera', 'confused', 'angry', 'teenager', 'growing', 'adulthood', 'Equally', 'excellent', 'Yuri', 'Nazarov', 'alcoholic', 'father', 'Vera', 'self-destruction', 'steers', 'lover', 'family', 'flurry', 'difficulties', 'including', 'run-ins', 'police', 'pregnancy.This', 'one', 'more', 'realistic', 'depictions', 'life', 'Russia', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'most', 'Russian', 'families', 'are', ""n't"", 'dysfunctional', 'midst', 'Vera', 'calamities', 'rebellion', 'see', 'genuinely', 'touching', 'scenes', 'father', 'who', 'spite', 'shortcomings', 'own', 'alcoholism', 'her.With', 'excellent', 'acting', 'directing', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Little', 'Vera']",Little Vera VHS
