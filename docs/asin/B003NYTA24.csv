1355963,ASXW7UQXGMNJL,B003NYTA24,"Alan A. Elsner ""Alan Elsner, author""","[2, 3]","This movie, in Russian and French, tells the story of a conductor forced to quit his job by the Communist authorities in Moscow in the early 1980s. We learn he was expelled and humiliated because he refused an order to throw the Jews out of his ensemble. He's now a janitor at the Bolshoi Theater, cleaning the director's carpet. But luck sends a new opportunity his way -- a chance to reform his orchestra and play one last great concert in Paris with a very special young French violinist as soloist.It's funny, it's charming and there is a kernel of something true and precious at the heart of this movie. Of course, it's also a bit formulaic -- but who cares. First rate entertainment, great music, a lovely heroine, a brooding hero, quirky minor characters -- who could ask for more?",5,Heartwarming comedy with serious side,1315353600,"09 7, 2011",2011,788,"['movie', 'Russian', 'French', 'story', 'conductor', 'forced', 'quit', 'job', 'Communist', 'authorities', 'Moscow', 'early', '1980s', 'learn', 'was', 'expelled', 'humiliated', 'refused', 'order', 'throw', 'Jews', 'ensemble', 'now', 'janitor', 'Bolshoi', 'Theater', 'cleaning', 'director', 'carpet', 'luck', 'new', 'opportunity', 'way', 'chance', 'reform', 'orchestra', 'play', 'one', 'last', 'great', 'concert', 'Paris', 'very', 'special', 'young', 'French', 'violinist', 'soloist.It', 'funny', 'charming', 'kernel', 'something', 'true', 'precious', 'heart', 'movie', 'course', 'also', 'bit', 'formulaic', 'who', 'First', 'rate', 'entertainment', 'great', 'music', 'lovely', 'heroine', 'brooding', 'hero', 'quirky', 'minor', 'characters', 'who', 'could', 'ask', 'more']",N/A

It is a comedy, but has many serious dramatic parts, also very emotional.  I watched the US DVD with English sound.  The best dubbing I ever heard.  The Russian characters speak English with a Russian accent, the French characters with French accent.  Timing is so good in most cases I forgot it was dubbed.  Maybe a special documentary on the DVD would have been a plus, but I don't miss it.  I highly recommend this film to anyone, but you will especially enjoy it if you are from the former communist block.As someone else pointed out, the US version is sadly cut and missing about 15 minutes of the film, notably several parts with King of Gas character.  This is especially unfortunate because he is one of the best characters of the film.  I thought censorship was a thing of the past.

1355965,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B003NYTA24,Andy Orrock,"[3, 4]","Like another reviewer here before me, I too had fairly major qualms about the believability of the main thread of this movie: that a rogue group of 20-years-banished musicians could intercept a proposal for a major international music organization; get and publicize a gig (with full advertising and TV coverage no less); and ultimately (after *considerable* difficulty getting to the stage) pull off a world-class concert WITHOUT PRACTICE.  Sure. That could happen.Still, if you can suspend you belief, 'Le Concert' is an enjoyable tale of redemption.  This is, at heart, staged as a wry, comedic tale.  So, I'll grant writer/director Radu Mihaileanu poetic license.  Mihaileanu - a Jewish emigre (to France) from Ceausescu-era Bucharest - has the background to stage a tale centering on a group of Soviet Jewry Refusniks.  And, at the center of his tale, Aleksei Guskov is likable and winning as director Andre Filipov.  We root for his triumph.  I also was delighted by the performance of Valeriy Barinov as Ivan Gavrilov, the orchestra's Soviet-era manager.  Though Gavrilov banished Filipov (or, at least, delivered the verdict), Filipov recognizes that he needs the apparatchik's considerable negotiating and fixing skills...as well as his more-than-passable French.  Barinov is wonderful - the best part of the film.There's also the not unpleasant sight of the beautiful M&eacute;lanie Laurent, here playing virtuoso violinist (and more - hint, hint), Anne-Marie Jacquet.  Until I remembered her fromParis, I was convinced they'd scored a real concert veteran for the role.  I've read reviews from musicians commenting that her fake playing is very believable.",4,Believable? No.  Enjoyable?

I now  have  discovered that the US Version does indeed have the Original Version,  Here's where you can find it:Go to Settings: then choose AUDIO Options;  Choose French/Russian.  Then resume movie.  The key to this is the default is set to the Dubbed version.In the Original version you hear the Actors voices.  The Film is subtle and quiet in creating these characters.  It says so much that as you watch this film, you realize you are watching something very special, even magical.  It is that powerful in its emotional impact.  This is not only rare, but something we only see as an exception that is exceptional.The Dubbed version is poor at best and all the magic is drained out.  Whoever did this took nothing from the original version.  If you want to do a comparison, look at the way the main character and his wife interact together.  In the Original it is real love in the quiet way they talk to each other.  The Dubbed version never comes close.So in Closing this review, I owe an apology to the ARC Entertainment that put out this US Version, but to be honest, they did not say that the Original version is on the disc.  Even Amazon had no idea and that's where I tried the European version.  That DVD is set up correctly, but as Region 2, you need a DVD Player that plays all regions.

Do you love watching a Russian and French 'reality show' filled with real people?  We got it!  Do you love feeling your heart and throat swell with emotion?  We definitely have got it in this film!I don't know where they got the story but I died laughing at the broad humor and caricature that was used in portraying the Russians in the beginning of the movie.  Having MANY close Russian friends and having traveled to many Russian cities, I couldn't help but get choked with emotion and laughter at this look inside Russia today.  If you understand about modern Russian weddings, you might chuckle the hardest through that scene and the Novy Russki.There are twists and turns that are unexpected and surprising.  There is a sense at one point that the film is moving away from the broad humor to a more serious vein.  It never gets heavy or ponderous but instead, like a flower opening from a bud to a full-blown flower, you begin to see and appreciate deeper human emotions and though the actors' experiences might not have been your own, their parts are acted in such a way that you feel emotion right along with them.  The cinematography is very interesting and presents flashbacks in a way that I have never seen but was very effective!I watched this in a large theater of senior citizens in south Florida.  Various parts of the room laughed at Jewish jokes, French jokes, and we all laughed at the antics of the Russians.  Even though the film was spoken in Russian and French with English subtitles, I thought the subtitles were very well done.  Sometimes foreign films either don't give you time to read the words by flashing them by too fast or they display them against inappropriate backgrounds making them virtually impossible to read.  I thought these subtitles were some of the best I've ever seen; thanks!!!The ONLY reason I didn't give this film 5 stars is because it is not Gone With the Wind or Dr. Zhivago or Lawrence of Arabia or even Elvira Madigan.  How about 4.5 stars?  It certainly deserves that!!!Buy this film and enjoy its sweet humanity.  It has yearnings and dreams that we can all understand.

Twenty-five years after losing his position as the conductor of the Bolshoi Orchestra for his refusal to fire the Jewish musicians, a once-famous musical director attempts to stage a late-career comeback. Andre Semoinovitch Filipov (Aleksei Guskov) was at the top of his game when the Soviet regime ended his career. Two decades later, he's working as a janitor in the same theater where he once conducted. In his spare time, Andre and his wife stage mock communist demonstrations to entertain the locals. When Andre happens across an invitation to Paris' famed Th&eacute;tre du Chtelet, he contacts his old orchestra friends in hopes of staging a performance that will bring the crowd to their feet for a standing ovation.During the development of the first movement of Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto, a sudden and unpleasant fact occurs. Such event will withstand in the mind of an untamed director as well as his musicians by then.The movie is developed like a Symphony in three movements. The first two deal with the efforts against the bureaucracy and obstacles to surmount to materialize a dream to perform a concert at the famous Hall in Paris.

Happily that is now an unnecessary purchase.  This movie is not without its imperfections, but it is also uniquely satisfying as it  swings with gusto from broad farce and roughneck socio/political silliness to its deeply moving finale.  I defy anyone with the least shred of appreciation for music to watch the last 20 minutes without tears rolling down your cheeks.  It is difficult to believe the director is the same man who made the remarkable Go, Live and Become (Va Vis et Deviens), which is one of the most serious and powerful films of the last decade.It is now Oct. 10, 2011 and I am adding the following paragraph to my original May 30 review.  Elsewhere Simina Farcasiu complains about the cuts to this release.  Having watched this region 1 dvd three or four times by now I became curious and since I already owned the all region dvd player mentioned at the beginning I purchased the region 2 disc and just began watching it.  Simina is absolutely correct.  After only 10 minutes I have counted about a dozen meaningless cuts, some only seconds in length, which serve no purpose but to mindlessly streamline a narrative which does not need streamlining.  In fact they weaken the impact significantly.  The film remains a delight but so much more so in the uncut European release.  My suggestion for those who care about such things is to purchase a PIONEER 420 -K all region dvd player.  It's only about $80 (!  There will certainly be other occasions when owning it will be useful.  Often there are films available in Europe that are totally unavailable here and with this machine they are all playable.

It was billed as a French film, and some described it as a tear-jerker, others a comedy.  When the action began in Russia, I groaned inwardly. Russian movies can be bleak, and I wasn't in the mood. But as the film progressed, I found myself drawn into the valiant, but realistically implausible, plotline about a former orchestra conductor, presently working as a janitor, who intercepts a fax to the Bolshoi orchestra begging the Bolshoi to play in Paris.  The fun begins when the conductor re-assembles his own, by now, ragtag former orchestra to take the gig.So as not to spoil your experience, I will keep my observations general. This is a movie about standing up for your beliefs, believing in yourself, and overcoming great odds to validate both yourself and your beliefs. There are quite a few delightful surprises, and many opportunities to chuckle if not guffaw.  If you're firmly rooted in reality, you will resist the suspension of disbelief this film requires, but if you can relax your Type-A self you will be pleasantly entertained.  There are some maudlin moments (hence the 4 star rating). These are most noticable toward the end of the movie, prior to and during an INCREDIBLE musical experience that made the real audience sitting beside me clap wildly along with the movie audience in the film.  How often does that happen?I left the theatre buoyed in spirit, hungry for Tchaikovsky music, and smiling.  To put my money where my review is, I've signed up for the DVD whenever it is released, and I've ordered the soundtrack.

Richardson ""Russian Life""","[7, 19]","On the artistic front (stuff like writing, believability, characterization, cinematography) this film is a must miss. Filled with hideous stereotypes, clich&eacute;s and plot twists that demand Golden Gate scale suspensions of disbelief, The Concert is pure cheese. M&eacute;lanie Laurent and Aleksei Gutskov take two for the team and offer very touching, at times charismatic performances with what they have been given, but that is far from enough.If you know anything about Russia (no, you can't walk all the way to Sheremetyevo from Central Moscow) or music (no, you can't assemble an orchestra and put on a concert without a single re-hearsal), you will probably find The Concert hard to sit through. Yet for Russophiles there is at least one redeeming virtue: most of the acting is done in Russian by Russian actors.
