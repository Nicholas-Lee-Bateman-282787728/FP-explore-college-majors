1093973,ANY46RC9MF6DB,B000UAE7J0,"Anne ""Mystery Fan""","[9, 9]","Ann Rule is the world's best true crime writer. It's almost impossible to put her books down once you've started them, and so I was happy to find one of her books made into a movie that came out on DVD. Few of the movies based on her books can be purchased.This one is a gem and two of TVs top stars have contributed memorable performances. I've loved Kathryn Morris, of Cold Case, since I saw her in ""The Contender"" in a small but brilliant role, and Mark Harmon, NCIS, has shown us once again how effectively he plays handsome, smooth, charming and deadly.Morris portrays Ann Marie Fahey, a beautiful, successful, well-educated woman who is still traumatized by childhood memories. She falls for a married, well-connected lawyer named Tom Capano whom another character mentions knows how to find needy women and capitalize on their neediness. When Ann Marie tries to break away from him, he kills her. The movie then focuses on the problems the police encounter when a very powerful and wealthy man commits a terrible crime then hides the body so effectively that it can't be found.I'm guessing that the main reason the police persisted in tracking Capano is because Fahey worked for the Governor who was determined to arrest her killer and who elicited the help of President Clinton in doing so.  Even Capano couldn't stand up to these two powerhouses.  Capano thought Fahey was unimportant.  If he had known that her connections were better than his own, I don't think he would have killed her.At the time of Capano's trial he was sentenced to death, but this has since been commuted to life in prison. I guess he was just too important to kill",5,Compelling Drama,1262217600,"12 31, 2009",2009,1648,"['Ann', 'Rule', 'world', 'best', 'true', 'crime', 'writer', 'almost', 'impossible', 'put', 'books', 'down', 'once', ""'ve"", 'started', 'so', 'was', 'happy', 'find', 'one', 'books', 'made', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'DVD', 'Few', 'movies', 'based', 'books', 'can', 'be', 'purchased.This', 'one', 'gem', 'two', 'TVs', 'top', 'stars', 'have', 'contributed', 'memorable', 'performances', ""'ve"", 'loved', 'Kathryn', 'Morris', 'Cold', 'Case', 'saw', 'Contender', 'small', 'brilliant', 'role', 'Mark', 'Harmon', 'NCIS', 'shown', 'once', 'again', 'how', 'effectively', 'handsome', 'charming', 'deadly.Morris', 'portrays', 'Ann', 'Marie', 'Fahey', 'beautiful', 'successful', 'well-educated', 'woman', 'who', 'still', 'traumatized', 'childhood', 'memories', 'married', 'well-connected', 'lawyer', 'named', 'Tom', 'Capano', 'whom', 'character', 'mentions', 'how', 'find', 'needy', 'women', 'capitalize', 'neediness', 'When', 'Ann', 'Marie', 'break', 'away', 'movie', 'then', 'problems', 'police', 'encounter', 'when', 'very', 'powerful', 'wealthy', 'man', 'terrible', 'crime', 'then', 'body', 'so', 'effectively', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'found.I', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'main', 'reason', 'police', 'persisted', 'tracking', 'Capano', 'Fahey', 'worked', 'Governor', 'who', 'was', 'determined', 'arrest', 'killer', 'who', 'elicited', 'help', 'President', 'Clinton', 'doing', 'so', 'Even', 'Capano', 'could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'up', 'two', 'powerhouses', 'Capano', 'thought', 'Fahey', 'was', 'unimportant', 'had', 'known', 'connections', 'were', 'better', 'own', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'have', 'killed', 'time', 'Capano', 'trial', 'was', 'sentenced', 'death', 'been', 'commuted', 'life', 'prison', 'guess', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'important', 'kill']",Ann Rule's And Never Let Her Go

1093975,A1UOTG037037XY,B000UAE7J0,Cleo,"[4, 7]","I caught this one late night on the movies for women channel because of Kathryn Morris who was all too briefly beautifully brunette in The Contender and Minority Report before she became a successful working actor with Cold Case.  This movie is very entertaining for a number of reasons: It has a strong East Coast Irish culture theme going on complete with sweaters, a pub and even a store selling those pricey white nightgowns and handmade lace.  Kathryn Morris has a wild nearsighted smiley face and lovely narrow silhouette, only her terrible bottle blonde pixie cut makes her believable as someone who doesn't like herself enough to put up with Mark Harmon's Tom Capano.  Mark Harmon is essentially acting like Mark Harmon which contrasts scarily with his lines.  So here's swooney aging well Mark Harmon with way too much disposable income, add in Rachel Ward with unflattering eyebrows and a believable American accent and OLYMPIA DUKAKIS pretending to be Italian again plus Kathryn Morris has a good girl bachelorette apartment with a lot of character appropriate tchotchkes and there is just not an unentertaining moment watching this movie.  It's very dishy and if it wasn't based on nonfiction, kinda anti-Italian American because there's a construction company, a dogmatic matriarch and ready access to career criminals.  This is definitely a cautionary tale to hold out for Mr. Right no matter how bored and underpaid you are.  There is no time wasted on any supposed romance between the victim and the murder.  This is not about ardor but cruelty and hatred of women.  Casting Mark Harmon just makes it easier to deliver the lesson but I had a feeling while watching this that the real Tom Capano is not nearly as charismatic and good looking as the actor who portrayed him.  Casting Kathryn Morris meant that the contents of the diary would not reflect negatively upon her characterbecause of the actress's ability to communicate vulnerability and worthiness; it is inconceivable that anyone could hurt her and inexcusable of anyone who would do so.",5,Surprisingly Awesome,1272931200,"05 4, 2010",2010,2064,"['caught', 'one', 'late', 'night', 'movies', 'women', 'channel', 'Kathryn', 'Morris', 'who', 'was', 'too', 'briefly', 'beautifully', 'brunette', 'Contender', 'Minority', 'Report', 'became', 'successful', 'working', 'actor', 'Cold', 'Case', 'movie', 'very', 'entertaining', 'number', 'reasons', 'strong', 'East', 'Coast', 'Irish', 'culture', 'theme', 'going', 'complete', 'sweaters', 'pub', 'even', 'store', 'selling', 'pricey', 'white', 'nightgowns', 'handmade', 'lace', 'Kathryn', 'Morris', 'wild', 'nearsighted', 'smiley', 'face', 'lovely', 'narrow', 'silhouette', 'only', 'terrible', 'bottle', 'blonde', 'pixie', 'cut', 'believable', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'like', 'enough', 'put', 'up', 'Mark', 'Harmon', 'Tom', 'Capano', 'Mark', 'Harmon', 'essentially', 'acting', 'Mark', 'Harmon', 'scarily', 'lines', 'So', 'here', 'swooney', 'aging', 'well', 'Mark', 'Harmon', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'disposable', 'income', 'add', 'Rachel', 'Ward', 'unflattering', 'eyebrows', 'believable', 'American', 'accent', 'OLYMPIA', 'DUKAKIS', 'pretending', 'be', 'Italian', 'again', 'Kathryn', 'Morris', 'good', 'girl', 'bachelorette', 'apartment', 'lot', 'character', 'appropriate', 'tchotchkes', 'just', 'not', 'unentertaining', 'moment', 'watching', 'movie', 'very', 'dishy', 'was', ""n't"", 'based', 'nonfiction', 'kinda', 'anti-Italian', 'American', 'construction', 'company', 'dogmatic', 'matriarch', 'ready', 'access', 'career', 'criminals', 'definitely', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'hold', 'out', 'Mr', 'Right', 'matter', 'how', 'bored', 'underpaid', 'are', 'time', 'wasted', 'supposed', 'romance', 'victim', 'murder', 'not', 'ardor', 'cruelty', 'hatred', 'women', 'Casting', 'Mark', 'Harmon', 'just', 'easier', 'deliver', 'lesson', 'had', 'feeling', 'watching', 'real', 'Tom', 'Capano', 'not', 'nearly', 'charismatic', 'good', 'looking', 'actor', 'who', 'portrayed', 'Casting', 'Kathryn', 'Morris', 'meant', 'contents', 'diary', 'would', 'not', 'reflect', 'negatively', 'characterbecause', 'actress', 'ability', 'communicate', 'vulnerability', 'worthiness', 'inconceivable', 'anyone', 'could', 'hurt', 'inexcusable', 'anyone', 'who', 'would', 'do', 'so']",Ann Rule's And Never Let Her Go

I knew the Capano Brothers and frequented the same watering hole  (O'Friel's) and actually met Ann Marie Fahey several times and we'd exchange polite conversation. We weren't friends but were friendly acquaintances. This movie depicts Ann Marie's relationship with manipulating Thomas Capano and her ultimate demise. In the movie the actress playing Ann Marie is blonde, however, Ann Marie had long curly brunette locks, which threw me when I first began watching the movie... then I realized this actress had learned many of Ann Marie's idiosyncracies and quirks and executed them well. Soon, I completely dismissed the fact that she didnt look like Ann Marie, but she sure did her justice in her portrayal. Mark Harmon is so good as Tom Capano that it's creepy good. Mark gave an excellent performance and sometimes when I think about all the friends and good people I've been so blessed to know...

Regardless, it is long and you'll wanna take the time to enjoy it properly.  Mark Harmin, who has portrayed his fair share of real-life baddies, including serial killer Ted Bundy, comes at us with another gripping performance, playing the minipulative and controling Delaware attorney Thomas Capano, whose popularity comes crashing down when he becomes the prime suspect in the dissappearance of his lover, Anne Marie Fahey.  This film chronicles Capano's relationship with Fahey, then the scheduling secretary for Delaware Governor Thomas Carper, his taking control over every aspect of her life, and the sixteen-month investigation between her dissapearance and his arrest for her murder.  Though we can never be sure what exactly happened as Anne Marie Fahey's body was never found and Capano died maintaining his innocence, this film shows us a chilling tale which the prosicution's evidence seems to support.

This reviewer and regular Ann Rule reader thinks that is not long enough.Adam Greenman's teleplay adaptation of Ms Rule's True Crime bookAnd Never Let Her Go: Thomas Capano: The Deadly Seducer, leaves out a lot and might leave the non-reader watcher befuddled and confused. For example, the torrid tawdry Capano/Christine affair is barely hinted, although it was a focal point of the trial and fodder for the tabloids.In contrast to the teleplay writer's wrongful redactions, the Casting Director is to be commended.  Pre-Naval Intelligence Mark Harmon is perfect as the slimy Thomas Capano;  Kathryn Morris is not a Cold Case  as victim Anne Marie Fahey, who narrates a la Brenda Strong's Mary Alice YoungDesperate Housewives - The Complete First Season; Rachel Ward, she of ill-starred romance (The Thorn Birds) is a cool Christine; and MommaMoonstruck (Deluxe Edition)is a magnificent matriarch for the Capano clan.So read the book this week, then, this weekend,  make a nice cozy fire and settle in to watch a wicked good movie./TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer",4,the Evil that Men Do,1200787200,"01 20, 2008",2008,1120,"['Made-for-TV', 'movie', 'runtime', '3', 'hrs', '20', 'minutes', 'reviewer', 'regular', 'Ann', 'Rule', 'reader', 'thinks', 'not', 'long', 'enough.Adam', 'Greenman', 'teleplay', 'adaptation', 'Ms', 'Rule', 'True', 'Crime', 'bookAnd', 'Never', 'Let', 'Her', 'Go', 'Thomas', 'Capano', 'Deadly', 'Seducer', 'out', 'lot', 'might', 'leave', 'non-reader', 'watcher', 'befuddled', 'confused', 'example', 'torrid', 'tawdry', 'Capano/Christine', 'affair', 'barely', 'hinted', 'was', 'focal', 'point', 'trial', 'fodder', 'tabloids.In', 'contrast', 'teleplay', 'writer', 'wrongful', 'redactions', 'Casting', 'Director', 'be', 'commended', 'Pre-Naval', 'Intelligence', 'Mark', 'Harmon', 'perfect', 'slimy', 'Thomas', 'Capano', 'Kathryn', 'Morris', 'not', 'Cold', 'Case', 'victim', 'Anne', 'Marie', 'Fahey', 'who', 'la', 'Brenda', 'Strong', 'Mary', 'Alice', 'YoungDesperate', 'Housewives', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', 'Rachel', 'Ward', 'ill-starred', 'romance', 'Thorn', 'Birds', 'cool', 'Christine', 'MommaMoonstruck', 'Deluxe', 'Edition', 'magnificent', 'matriarch', 'Capano', 'clan.So', 'read', 'book', 'week', 'then', 'weekend', 'make', 'nice', 'cozy', 'fire', 'settle', 'watch', 'wicked', 'good', 'movie./TundraVision', 'Amazon', 'Reviewer']",Ann Rule's And Never Let Her Go
