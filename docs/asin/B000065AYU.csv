However, the second episode is easily one of my favorites. When the moon turns red, Kaolla transforms into an older version of herself. Kaolla's sister, Amalla Su, shows up at Hinata Hot Springs to deal with her little sister's transformation by getting rid of the man who is causing it: Keitaro! (he reminds Kaolla of her older brother) Amalla Su has a white alligator named Shiro as a pet. Yes, you heard me, she has a white alligator!The third episode has Naru becoming an idol singer (and she sings a nice song in the episode). Sure, it's wierd when you watch an English dub and the singing is still Japanese, but at least the songs are there even in the English versionThe last episode has everyone learn that Motoko is afraid of turtles, including the resident flying and talking Tama. This leads ultimately to a giant robot turtle attacking the Hinata Apartments.These are mostly filler episodes, but entertaining nonetheless.

This release shows the Hinata turtle flying, a tame alligator named Shiro, a giant metal turtle that tries to eat the apartments, and magical girls transformations.We see that Kitsune is a prankster. The relationship between Keitaro and Naru grows with Keitaro voicing his feeling outright and Naru showing that she likes having him around. Su's background is covered vaguely as her sister arrives in town and we learn that Su left her homeland to get away from something. We learn that Naru can sing. Motoko learns that her &quot;chi&quot; (inner strength) is only defeated by her own fears.Unfortunately, the english dub is still the achilles heel. (I'd stick to the Japanese track and use subtitles.) Other than that, this installment was not a disappointment.

Turns out that Kaolla has a older sister and she is even crazier than kaolla. Naru becomes a pop star in this dvd and the music that she sings is just awesome. I just love the two songs that she sings and I would personally recommend finding those two songs on your own. Aside from that this dvd was well worth the price of getting!!!,5,A great part of the series!!!,1116288000,"05 17, 2005",2005,433,"['Wow', 'viewing', 'dvds', 'far', 'personally', 'one', 'dvd', 'new', 'character', 'out', 'Kaolla', 'older', 'sister', 'even', 'crazier', 'kaolla', 'Naru', 'pop', 'star', 'dvd', 'music', 'just', 'awesome', 'just', 'love', 'two', 'songs', 'would', 'personally', 'recommend', 'finding', 'two', 'songs', 'own', 'Aside', 'dvd', 'was', 'well', 'price', 'getting']",Love Hina: Volume 3 - Secret Lives - Episodes 9-12

So, Kitsune and Su start seeing who the thief was, but it was nobody at the Hinata Inn. Then, Kitsune says she did. And she has a very clever way, too. To find out who she did it, buy this DVD! In episode 10, Everytime the red moon comes out, there's a mysterious woman with an alligator. Kentaro Sakata is going to give flowers to Naru, but on his way, he discovers the girl, and gives them to her instead. She refuses the flowers, and her alligator beats him up. We discover that Kaolla Su turns into an adult version of herself when the red moon is out. Kentaro says that that girl is Su, but she is not. Instead, she is Su's sister, Amalla Su. She wants Su to come back with her, but Su refuses. This is also another one of my favorite episodes. In episode 11, Naru becomes a pop-star. She gets tired of singing, so she decides to go back to her normal life. In episode 12, Motoko's clothes have been washed, and she has nothing to wear. So, she ends up wearing girl clothes, which she does not like.

The first part with Naru becoming a pop star had some good music in it, will be interested to see what the english version has.  The second episode with Su turning in to her adult version when the red moon is out is rather entertaining, and you get to meet her older sister and her white alligator.  The third episode with Motoko trying to act like a girl was entertaining just because of the premise.  The fourth one with the giant turtle that Su built was good in just watching Motoko's reaction to it.  Most of the episodes (except the second one with Su) are not really needed to be viewed to understand the whole story, but they are still entertaining.
