1271382,A3E3VGOWHL4OPR,B002JHD9DC,Chris L,"[0, 0]","This is one of those rare finds that you wonder about, if they finally put it on DVD or not. When I found this it was so great to see that they did. Infact, at the time I wasn't even aware of the show until I saw a recommendation for me and when I saw this DVD, I had completely forgotten about watching this when it was on TV as a kid. I totally loved this show! This show was great because it combined children's television, cartoon and scary stories all into one. Today you don't see shows like this anymore because parents are to crazy and overprotective to let their kids watch such great shows. Infact most crazy parents today would say this should not be on TV. oh how I wish there'd be a way to punish them for doing such things to kids to deprive them of such fun but oh well.Anyhow, the show takes its stories from the EC archives and makes them a little more kid friendly. The stories are meant to create suspense and a little terror. I think for any great parent who raises their kids early to watch scary movies, this would be a great thing for them to watch just to help get them going on the genre. Another great show that is the next stepping stone for scary watching is ""Are you Afraid of the Dark?"" That one got me going a few times when I used to watch it. Wish they had that on DVD too.What is great about this show is that it helped pave the way for the HBO show, ""Tales from the Crypt,"" they kept the same voice actor, cryptkeeper, and followed the same story structure, with the crpytkeeper introducing the audience to the story. So if you have youngin' that love a good scare now and then, order this for them because they will be sure to love it. I know I did when I used to watch it on Saturday morning cartoons.",4,What a great product on DVD,1343001600,"07 23, 2012",2012,1738,"['one', 'rare', 'wonder', 'finally', 'put', 'DVD', 'not', 'When', 'found', 'was', 'so', 'great', 'see', 'did', 'Infact', 'time', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'aware', 'show', 'saw', 'recommendation', 'when', 'saw', 'DVD', 'had', 'completely', 'forgotten', 'watching', 'when', 'was', 'TV', 'kid', 'totally', 'loved', 'show', 'show', 'was', 'great', 'combined', 'children', 'television', 'cartoon', 'scary', 'stories', 'one', 'Today', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'shows', 'anymore', 'parents', 'are', 'crazy', 'overprotective', 'let', 'kids', 'watch', 'such', 'great', 'shows', 'Infact', 'most', 'crazy', 'parents', 'today', 'would', 'say', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'TV', 'how', 'wish', ""'d"", 'be', 'way', 'punish', 'doing', 'such', 'things', 'kids', 'deprive', 'such', 'fun', 'oh', 'well.Anyhow', 'show', 'stories', 'EC', 'archives', 'little', 'more', 'kid', 'friendly', 'stories', 'are', 'meant', 'create', 'suspense', 'little', 'terror', 'think', 'great', 'parent', 'who', 'kids', 'early', 'watch', 'scary', 'movies', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'thing', 'watch', 'just', 'help', 'get', 'going', 'genre', 'great', 'show', 'next', 'stepping', 'stone', 'scary', 'watching', 'Are', 'Afraid', 'Dark', 'one', 'got', 'going', 'few', 'times', 'when', 'used', 'watch', 'Wish', 'had', 'DVD', 'too.What', 'great', 'show', 'helped', 'pave', 'way', 'HBO', 'show', 'Tales', 'Crypt', 'kept', 'same', 'voice', 'actor', 'cryptkeeper', 'followed', 'same', 'story', 'structure', 'crpytkeeper', 'introducing', 'audience', 'story', 'So', 'have', 'youngin', 'love', 'good', 'scare', 'now', 'then', 'order', 'will', 'be', 'sure', 'love', 'know', 'did', 'when', 'used', 'watch', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'cartoons']",N/A

1271384,A3I9UPX8UYFB5L,B002JHD9DC,Exchronos,"[10, 10]","Admittedly, I've only watched disc 1 thus far! I bought both Seasons 1 and Season 2, but Season 2 has the episodes I mainly remember from my childhood and are my favorites! In fact the ""The Haunted Mine"" episode is so great that I've spent years trying to find it, but it was so good that I remembered it as a live action movie instead of just an episode of this cartoon series! That episode alone is worth the price of the DVD set itself! The title episode for this set ""All The Gory Details"" turned out to be my favorite episode I mainly remember this show for (other than ""The Haunted Mine"" which was a surprise bonus, I mean, I hoped it could be that story I remembered, but I really remembered it being live action...which now I think might be because it's thus far the only episode not centered around young kids, the youngest people in it are at least driving age, the characterization is top notch, and the plot is truly memorable). This set has vampires, Frankenstein-like monsters, Were-Fish, the Grim Reaper with a zombie basketball team, a very touching ghost story (that scared the heck outta me as a kid, but now it's not as scary despite being incredibly well done), and more. Like I said, this is just the first disc I'm reviewing because I haven't gotten to the second one yet!The only annoying thing about this season is that some stories are shorter (but you get two per episode) and the addition of the Vault Keeper and the Old Witch trying to steal the show from the Cryptkeeper. Though when somebody other than the Cryptkeeper tells the story you do get some really good episodes, like ""All The Gory Details"" and ""The Haunted Mine"" which are told by the Vault Keeper. The Old Witch serves up the story of the were-fish, and of the basketball game against the Grim Reaper. The first season was alright, but this second season is a must have and is absolutely top notch quality!",5,The Best Of The Best,1256601600,"10 27, 2009",2009,1898,"['Admittedly', ""'ve"", 'only', 'watched', 'disc', '1', 'thus', 'far', 'bought', 'Seasons', '1', 'Season', '2', 'Season', '2', 'episodes', 'mainly', 'remember', 'childhood', 'are', 'favorites', 'fact', 'Haunted', 'Mine', 'episode', 'so', 'great', ""'ve"", 'spent', 'years', 'trying', 'find', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'remembered', 'live', 'action', 'movie', 'instead', 'just', 'episode', 'cartoon', 'series', 'episode', 'alone', 'price', 'DVD', 'set', 'title', 'episode', 'set', 'Gory', 'Details', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'favorite', 'episode', 'mainly', 'remember', 'show', 'other', 'Haunted', 'Mine', 'was', 'surprise', 'bonus', 'mean', 'hoped', 'could', 'be', 'story', 'remembered', 'really', 'remembered', 'being', 'live', 'action', 'now', 'think', 'might', 'be', 'thus', 'far', 'only', 'episode', 'not', 'centered', 'young', 'kids', 'youngest', 'people', 'are', 'least', 'driving', 'age', 'characterization', 'top', 'notch', 'plot', 'truly', 'memorable', 'set', 'vampires', 'Frankenstein-like', 'monsters', 'Were-Fish', 'Grim', 'Reaper', 'zombie', 'basketball', 'team', 'very', 'touching', 'ghost', 'story', 'scared', 'heck', 'outta', 'kid', 'now', 'not', 'scary', 'being', 'incredibly', 'well', 'done', 'more', 'said', 'just', 'first', 'disc', ""'m"", 'reviewing', 'have', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'second', 'one', 'yet', 'only', 'annoying', 'thing', 'season', 'stories', 'are', 'shorter', 'get', 'two', 'episode', 'addition', 'Vault', 'Keeper', 'Old', 'Witch', 'trying', 'steal', 'show', 'Cryptkeeper', 'when', 'somebody', 'other', 'Cryptkeeper', 'story', 'do', 'get', 'really', 'good', 'episodes', 'Gory', 'Details', 'Haunted', 'Mine', 'are', 'told', 'Vault', 'Keeper', 'Old', 'Witch', 'up', 'story', 'were-fish', 'basketball', 'game', 'Grim', 'Reaper', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'alright', 'second', 'season', 'must', 'have', 'absolutely', 'top', 'notch', 'quality']",N/A

1271386,A1KUWGZ04I0W2R,B002JHD9DC,Supercalafragilisticexpealadocious,"[0, 0]","I LOVE the first season, and this second season is JUST as fun, and ALMOST as perfect, naturally, you cannot usually re-create the same exact amount of fun, perfection, or greatness as it's successor, but this one was close, a perfect follow-up season no less, and surprisingly so since this is not the type of show that would be easy to keep as ghoulish and still delicious! Anyways, this time we don't just get the Cryptkeeper, we also get the Vault Keeper and the Old Witch, making the epilogue and prologue a little more fun than the first. This second season has some of the character's from the previous season in this one in entirely different situations and with entirely different monsters than whatever they previously faced, which I really liked, also, disregard the DVD cover art for the second season, those kids and Deacula are NOT in this season, only in the FIRST season. There are some vampire's towards the end of the last episode of this season, a lot less vampire's than the first season, but there are Werewolves, a lot of Frankenstein Creature's, and all new monsters like Medusa, Fish Monsters, A Giant Slug, Plant People, A Troll, A Giant, and many, many more! This is HIGHLY recommendable just like the first, especially if you're a fan of monsters and Tales from the Crypt, hurry and get this before it's even more out-of-print like the first!Tales from the Cryptkeeper: The Complete Second Season - All the Gory Details ***** out of *****Violent Content: 3/10 - Monster Violence, Frightening Images, Some Fighting, and Cruel Teen Bullying.",5,"Just like season one, this is ghoulicious fun!",1393977600,"03 5, 2014",2014,1566,"['LOVE', 'first', 'season', 'second', 'season', 'JUST', 'fun', 'ALMOST', 'perfect', 'naturally', 'can', 'not', 'usually', 're-create', 'same', 'exact', 'amount', 'fun', 'perfection', 'greatness', 'successor', 'one', 'was', 'close', 'perfect', 'follow-up', 'season', 'less', 'surprisingly', 'so', 'not', 'type', 'show', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'keep', 'ghoulish', 'still', 'delicious', 'Anyways', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'get', 'Cryptkeeper', 'also', 'get', 'Vault', 'Keeper', 'Old', 'Witch', 'making', 'epilogue', 'prologue', 'little', 'more', 'fun', 'first', 'second', 'season', 'character', 'previous', 'season', 'one', 'entirely', 'different', 'situations', 'entirely', 'different', 'monsters', 'previously', 'faced', 'really', 'liked', 'also', 'disregard', 'DVD', 'cover', 'art', 'second', 'season', 'kids', 'Deacula', 'are', 'NOT', 'season', 'only', 'FIRST', 'season', 'are', 'vampire', 'towards', 'end', 'last', 'episode', 'season', 'lot', 'less', 'vampire', 'first', 'season', 'are', 'Werewolves', 'lot', 'Frankenstein', 'Creature', 'new', 'monsters', 'Medusa', 'Fish', 'Monsters', 'A', 'Giant', 'Slug', 'Plant', 'People', 'A', 'Troll', 'A', 'Giant', 'many', 'many', 'more', 'HIGHLY', 'recommendable', 'just', 'first', 'especially', ""'re"", 'fan', 'monsters', 'Tales', 'Crypt', 'hurry', 'get', 'even', 'more', 'out-of-print', 'first', 'Tales', 'Cryptkeeper', 'Complete', 'Second', 'Season', 'Gory', 'Details', '*****Violent', 'Content', '3/10', 'Monster', 'Violence', 'Frightening', 'Images', 'Fighting', 'Cruel', 'Teen', 'Bullying']",N/A
