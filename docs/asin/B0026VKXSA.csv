Not to mention the gangs that had already taken hold prior to the flood, I felt that Val Kilmer and Curtis Jackson aka 50 cents did convincing performances as cops battling these dealers.I saw nothing fake not really your basic drug dealer vs police movie lots of side stories and hardcore street stuff will keep your attention I give this 4 stars.",4,Good hardcore street stuff,1282262400,"08 20, 2010",2010,680,"['did', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'true', 'story', 'what', 'happened', 'various', 'wards', 'flood', 'water', 'receeded', 'was', 'influx', 'drug', 'gangs', 'moved', 'New', 'Orleans', 'control', 'drug', 'traffic', 'gangs', 'where', 'mostly', 'Mexican', 'who', 'came', 'area', 'looking', 'work', 'also', 'brought', 'gangs', 'Not', 'mention', 'gangs', 'had', 'already', 'taken', 'hold', 'prior', 'flood', 'felt', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'Curtis', 'Jackson', 'aka', '50', 'cents', 'did', 'convincing', 'performances', 'cops', 'battling', 'dealers.I', 'saw', 'nothing', 'fake', 'not', 'really', 'basic', 'drug', 'dealer', 'vs', 'police', 'movie', 'lots', 'side', 'stories', 'hardcore', 'street', 'stuff', 'will', 'keep', 'attention', 'give', '4', 'stars']",Streets Of Blood

1252128,AXMKZHK6MDRRK,B0026VKXSA,Denise J. Murray,"[3, 3]","The film starts out with an overview and reminder of how devastating Katrina was. The characters are not well fleshed out, with the exception of Andy and even then it doesn't dig real deep into who he is. It is extremely violent and without the F bomb the dialog would be pretty sparce.  It did paint a nightmarish picture of the control that the gangs had on the city, and the means that the cops had to employ to try and keep it under as much control as they could. With the kind of violence that the gangs were involved in the film could have made a strong statement against disarming the citizens when they needed self protection the most. There was so much mishandling of the events after Katrina that contributed to the violence and desperation of the citizens. Some of the violence seems gratuitous but typical Hollywood.  I think Val Kilmer did the best he could with what he had but it was definately not up to his talent. Andy is kind of a tragic character trying to live up to the image of his dad and avenge his death with every collar, at what seems to be at the expense of a life.  Sharon Stone was so-so and the rest were okey.If you are a Kilmer fan, get it.

After all these years, this has to be the gang/mob version of pointing to the sky and saying ""Look, the Goodyear Blimp!"" to sucker punch somebody.

A better director and it might have emerged. I'm interested to see more of his work. And given the (surprisingly) huge plethora of upcoming films listed on his IMDb schedule - I guess we'll see if that spark can be turned into fire.Sadly, another in a long list of paycheck roles for Val Kilmer. Who, when given the chance, can still do some amazing things. Check out 'Felon', 'Spartan' and 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang'. When in a proper vehicle, he shows he still has the skills.I do appreciate and give credit to the cast and crew for working in flood-wrecked New Orleans. Unfortunately, it comes on the heels of so many well-intentioned preachy productions that actually do a disservice to the city and community by producing video slop.

Durham ""Big Evil""","[4, 5]","Streets of Blood starts out promising enough, as it tells the tale of two cops (Val Kilmer and Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson) in a post-Hurricane Katrina landscape trying to regain control of the drug underworld they police. Coming off as more of an uncensored episode of any prime-time TV cop drama than a real crime saga, Streets of Blood features plenty of shaky camerawork, and even shakier accents. As much as I love Val Kilmer, he's just so stale here, and the fact that his accent keeps changing up doesn't help matters either. Sharon Stone is more than guilty of this as well, as 50 Cent ends up putting in the best performance of the whole show here.

We needed a clear sense of where it was going. I was delighted to see Sharon Stone, but she showed little ""acting chops"" in this film.

I kept expecting her to rise to the challenge, and that there would be a change of gears, and the plot would really take off..BAM!! Never happened.Most of the people, including the police captain, were left dead, and by the end, I felt not much sense of resolution or completion.

From the funny accents that disappear, to the horrible camera work, to the 3D style effects of flashbacks, to the stop-style editing (the film freezes prior to each fade to black cut), to that horrendous ending - all made for another frustrating outing for Kilmer.Kilmer plays a boy scout drug cop fighting the bad guys on the streets and in the FBI. His partner is 50 Cent (sadly enough his best role to date) who cannot seem to decide if he is good or bad. Michael Biehn plays the FBI agent trying to spice things up (failing miserably) and Sharon Stone (scarily unrecognizable) plays the department shrink who violates probably every rule there can be - including having four different accents in the same film. Our plot meanders from Katrina to several years after as our corrupt characters kill and steal their way through their PD work. One memorable moment is when Kilmer and 50 Cent are going to shoot 20 armed guys in an abandoned school, Val gave the exact same speech from Tombstone in the same accent - deja vu.There are no special features, bad film quality and sound that is intermittently mixed at best. I was hoping for more as this film made the promo posters, and I really tried to give it a solid shot, but after attempting to overlook the laundry list of issues I then got to that last shot - literally - and was appalled they ended the film that way.Gave it one more star for the Katrina aftermath footage they included in the credits, heartbreaking as always.",2,"Puns aside, what a disaster this film was",1248393600,"07 24, 2009",2009,1668,"['Knowing', 'film', 'police', 'department', 'trying', 'regain', 'control', 'drug', 'trade', 'midst', 'Katrina', 'aftermath', 'was', 'fitting', 'can', 'be', 'called', 'disaster', 'funny', 'accents', 'disappear', 'horrible', 'camera', 'work', '3D', 'style', 'effects', 'flashbacks', 'stop-style', 'editing', 'film', 'prior', 'fade', 'black', 'cut', 'horrendous', 'ending', 'made', 'frustrating', 'outing', 'Kilmer.Kilmer', 'boy', 'scout', 'drug', 'cop', 'fighting', 'bad', 'guys', 'streets', 'FBI', 'partner', '50', 'Cent', 'sadly', 'enough', 'best', 'role', 'date', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'seem', 'decide', 'good', 'bad', 'Michael', 'Biehn', 'FBI', 'agent', 'trying', 'spice', 'things', 'up', 'failing', 'miserably', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'scarily', 'unrecognizable', 'department', 'shrink', 'who', 'probably', 'rule', 'can', 'be', 'including', 'having', 'four', 'different', 'accents', 'same', 'film', 'plot', 'meanders', 'Katrina', 'several', 'years', 'corrupt', 'characters', 'kill', 'steal', 'way', 'PD', 'work', 'One', 'memorable', 'moment', 'when', 'Kilmer', '50', 'Cent', 'are', 'going', 'shoot', '20', 'armed', 'guys', 'abandoned', 'school', 'Val', 'gave', 'exact', 'same', 'speech', 'Tombstone', 'same', 'accent', 'deja', 'are', 'special', 'features', 'bad', 'film', 'quality', 'sound', 'intermittently', 'mixed', 'best', 'was', 'hoping', 'more', 'film', 'made', 'promo', 'posters', 'really', 'tried', 'give', 'solid', 'shot', 'attempting', 'overlook', 'laundry', 'list', 'issues', 'then', 'got', 'last', 'shot', 'literally', 'was', 'appalled', 'ended', 'film', 'way.Gave', 'one', 'more', 'star', 'Katrina', 'aftermath', 'footage', 'included', 'credits', 'heartbreaking', 'always']",Streets Of Blood
