Like Brandon Lee (RIP), Edward Furlong throws himself into the role of the Crow.  After he comes back from the dead he really shows his pain and his anger as well as his need for forgiveness.  Redemption is something we all seek and we can all relate to that.  Edward also really does look the part.  If you loved the first one as I do, you'll give this one a chance.  Edward and David do a wonderful job with their roles.  But Tara Reid, why why why, but other than that little bad actress, the movie was a story of love always over coming death and setting the wrong things right!",4,"It's a good movie people, listen to me",1221868800,"09 20, 2008",2008,684,"['one', 'star', 'reviewers', 'have', 'say', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'movie', 'fair', 'chance', 'Brandon', 'Lee', 'RIP', 'Edward', 'Furlong', 'role', 'Crow', 'back', 'dead', 'really', 'pain', 'anger', 'as', 'well', 'need', 'forgiveness', 'Redemption', 'something', 'seek', 'can', 'relate', 'Edward', 'also', 'really', 'look', 'part', 'loved', 'first', 'one', 'do', ""'ll"", 'give', 'one', 'chance', 'Edward', 'David', 'do', 'wonderful', 'job', 'roles', 'Tara', 'Reid', 'why', 'why', 'why', 'other', 'little', 'bad', 'actress', 'movie', 'was', 'story', 'love', 'always', 'coming', 'death', 'setting', 'wrong', 'things', 'right']",N/A

I mean it had a good story some fair fighting and the trademark crow look what more do you want? I personaly thought that Edward Ferlong pulled the role off nicly he added a different vibe to the film. I also thought the score was really good too it had a similar sound as the first film in my opinion but with some different musical elements added. Plus having a desert like setting was a nice change from the usual city setting. I also liked how Edward Furlong's character wasn't a very well liked person it gave the film a different kind of twist. Last of all if you are a fan of The Crow films than I am sure you will like this one as well. But if you weren't fond of The Crow: City of Angels or The Crow: Salvation then you probably wont like it.But I gave this movie five stars because I feel that it was a very creative film and had a very good story.,5,I don't understand the bashing of this film?,1121904000,"07 21, 2005",2005,984,"['may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'Crow', 'film', 'still', 'good', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'people', 'hate', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'mean', 'had', 'good', 'story', 'fair', 'fighting', 'trademark', 'crow', 'look', 'what', 'more', 'do', 'want', 'personaly', 'thought', 'Edward', 'Ferlong', 'pulled', 'role', 'nicly', 'added', 'different', 'vibe', 'film', 'also', 'thought', 'score', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'too', 'had', 'similar', 'sound', 'first', 'film', 'opinion', 'different', 'musical', 'elements', 'added', 'having', 'desert', 'setting', 'was', 'nice', 'change', 'usual', 'city', 'setting', 'also', 'liked', 'how', 'Edward', 'Furlong', 'character', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'well', 'liked', 'person', 'gave', 'film', 'different', 'kind', 'twist', 'Last', 'are', 'fan', 'Crow', 'films', 'am', 'sure', 'will', 'like', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'were', ""n't"", 'fond', 'Crow', 'City', 'Angels', 'Crow', 'Salvation', 'then', 'probably', 'wont', 'it.But', 'gave', 'movie', 'five', 'stars', 'feel', 'was', 'very', 'creative', 'film', 'had', 'very', 'good', 'story']",N/A

It is by far the worst Crow ever and quite simply, almost the worst movie I've seen. I powered through it hoping the end would vindicate it. No such luck. Furlong has no credibility as the Crow. He looks like a girl with the makeup and choker and he had zero confidence. Tara Reid is ridiculous as is most of the cast except for the girlfriend of the Crow. Add to it that I think none of the Native Americans were actually Native Americans. The plot sucked, the acting sucked and the story is a waste of time.

891237,A1FE06N5A77K8W,B0007US7DA,Annie Feng,"[2, 6]","I'm a big David Boreanaz fan and that's how I came to known the Crow films in the first place. So basically I haven't seen the original one so I'm only basing the ratings on my impression, as someone who saw this as a film by itself, not comparing it to the original film, which, from watching this one, I'm taking an interest.The film is really, for a lack of a better word- so so. All the actors are fine, they are not great, but they all pulled off a decent performance. I felt David Boreanaz is a miscast though, I like it that he's in the film ('cause I'm a fan, duh) but I truly felt the film is making him living too much in the shadow of Angelus, which he did a brilliant performance in the TV series Angel. I do believe that David can pull off a bad guy who isn't Angelus but as Crash/Satan/death, the sadism is RIGHT THERE, so he's pretty much like Angelus but not as great 'cause there are no brlliant lines that makes your hair stand up like Angelus' linesFor all those people who hate Edward Furlong, can I juss say ?! I felt he did a great job pulling off The Crow with that full of confusion, full of hatred, full of despair feelings all at the same time. To be honest, if I had to pick a favorite performance from the film, I think I would pick him (that is, after I overcome the biase over David hehe- hey at least I'm honest about it)Tere Raid is okay, not that great, she has too much of that American Pie on her, I don't think she's fitting playing an evil girl, I don't feel the evil in her, but she did pull off the slut pretty well- what can I say, that's another American Pie trait anyways.the movie I felt is not exciting enough, it's half gore and half Constantine elemento. But The Crow is pretty cool, but then again I haven't seen the first one, but I'm looking forward to it.",3,three stars is a pretty fair rating for this film,1144454400,"04 8, 2006",2006,1805,"[""'m"", 'big', 'David', 'Boreanaz', 'fan', 'how', 'came', 'known', 'Crow', 'films', 'first', 'place', 'basically', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'original', 'one', 'so', ""'m"", 'only', 'basing', 'ratings', 'impression', 'someone', 'who', 'saw', 'film', 'not', 'comparing', 'original', 'film', 'watching', 'one', ""'m"", 'taking', 'interest.The', 'film', 'really', 'lack', 'better', 'word-', 'so', 'so', 'actors', 'are', 'fine', 'are', 'not', 'great', 'pulled', 'off', 'decent', 'performance', 'felt', 'David', 'Boreanaz', 'miscast', 'like', 'film', ""'m"", 'fan', 'duh', 'truly', 'felt', 'film', 'making', 'living', 'too', 'much', 'shadow', 'Angelus', 'did', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'TV', 'series', 'Angel', 'do', 'believe', 'David', 'can', 'pull', 'off', 'bad', 'guy', 'who', ""n't"", 'Angelus', 'Crash/Satan/death', 'sadism', 'RIGHT', 'THERE', 'pretty', 'much', 'Angelus', 'not', 'great', 'are', 'brlliant', 'lines', 'hair', 'stand', 'up', 'Angelus', 'linesFor', 'people', 'who', 'hate', 'Edward', 'Furlong', 'can', 'juss', 'say', 'felt', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'pulling', 'off', 'Crow', 'full', 'confusion', 'full', 'hatred', 'full', 'despair', 'feelings', 'same', 'time', 'be', 'honest', 'had', 'pick', 'favorite', 'performance', 'film', 'think', 'would', 'pick', 'overcome', 'biase', 'David', 'hehe-', 'hey', 'least', ""'m"", 'honest', 'Tere', 'Raid', 'okay', 'not', 'great', 'too', 'much', 'American', 'Pie', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'fitting', 'playing', 'evil', 'girl', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'evil', 'did', 'pull', 'off', 'slut', 'pretty', 'well-', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'American', 'Pie', 'trait', 'anyways.the', 'movie', 'felt', 'not', 'exciting', 'enough', 'half', 'gore', 'half', 'Constantine', 'elemento', 'Crow', 'pretty', 'cool', 'then', 'again', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'first', 'one', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward']",N/A
891238,A3TQZ521KSRUZ1,B0007US7DA,Anthony Scheinman,"[0, 3]","Based (pretty loosely) on the novel by Norman Partridge in THE CROW paperback series published by HarperCollins, THE CROW: WICKED PRAYER keeps to the legend of The Crow in some respects and brings some new things to the table, but on the whole is not as satisfying as the previous three CROW films.  In the previous fiims, the person who is brought back from the dead has been an innocent victim; here, Jimmy Cuervo (played by Edward Furlong) is not an innocent but a man who has committed murder out of anger (and even though he has ""paid his debt to society for his crime"" [this quote is mine], the people in the dying Southwestern town he lives in will not let him forget it).  For the most part, the formula which creates The Crow is pretty standard (the only difference so far has been in THE CROW: CITY OF ANGELS, where it was the ""hero""'s son who was murdered with him, not his girlfriend), but in this film the viewer doesn't seem to feel much of The Crow's inner pain or too much sympathy for him.  David Boreanaz is charming as ""Luc"", the villain of the piece, but some of the dialogue given to him is a little too comic for me, and his plan to make himself Satan on Earth ... give me a break! I'm afraid he just doesn't match up to the previous CROW villains: Top Dollar (Michael Wincott, THE CROW), Judah Earl (Richard Brook, THE CROW: CITY OF ANGELS) and The Captain (Fred Ward, THE CROW: SALVATION). Tara Reid is cute as Luc's evil lover and accomplice, but again she doesn't have the pure evil of Bai Ling as ""Myra"" in THE CROW or Thuy Trang as ""Kali"" in THE CROW: CITY OF ANGELS.  As for the other members of Luc's ""Four Horsemen"", they don't convey any evil or unredeeming quality; in fact, in this film they are poor slobs who have been manipulated by Luc into being his henchmen.In short, if you want to have a complete collection of THE CROW films I would recommend buying this one ... it's good but not great; it doesn't quite meet the standards that the previous three films set.  Here's hoping that if another CROW film is made, the next director and screenwriter learn from what didn't work here.",3,THE CROW flies for the fourth time ... but its plumage doesn't shine so much this time.,1127174400,"09 20, 2005",2005,2120,"['Based', 'pretty', 'loosely', 'novel', 'Norman', 'Partridge', 'THE', 'CROW', 'paperback', 'series', 'published', 'HarperCollins', 'THE', 'CROW', 'WICKED', 'PRAYER', 'legend', 'Crow', 'respects', 'new', 'things', 'table', 'whole', 'not', 'as', 'satisfying', 'previous', 'three', 'CROW', 'films', 'previous', 'fiims', 'person', 'who', 'brought', 'back', 'dead', 'been', 'innocent', 'victim', 'here', 'Jimmy', 'Cuervo', 'played', 'Edward', 'Furlong', 'not', 'innocent', 'man', 'who', 'committed', 'murder', 'anger', 'even', 'paid', 'debt', 'society', 'crime', '[', 'quote', 'mine', ']', 'people', 'dying', 'Southwestern', 'town', 'will', 'not', 'let', 'forget', 'most', 'part', 'formula', 'Crow', 'pretty', 'standard', 'only', 'difference', 'so', 'far', 'been', 'THE', 'CROW', 'CITY', 'OF', 'ANGELS', 'where', 'was', 'hero', 'son', 'who', 'was', 'murdered', 'not', 'girlfriend', 'film', 'viewer', ""n't"", 'seem', 'feel', 'much', 'Crow', 'inner', 'pain', 'too', 'much', 'sympathy', 'David', 'Boreanaz', 'charming', 'Luc', 'villain', 'piece', 'dialogue', 'given', 'little', 'too', 'comic', 'plan', 'make', 'Satan', 'Earth', 'give', 'break', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'just', ""n't"", 'match', 'up', 'previous', 'CROW', 'villains', 'Top', 'Dollar', 'Michael', 'Wincott', 'THE', 'CROW', 'Judah', 'Earl', 'Richard', 'Brook', 'THE', 'CROW', 'CITY', 'OF', 'ANGELS', 'Captain', 'Fred', 'Ward', 'THE', 'CROW', 'SALVATION', 'Tara', 'Reid', 'cute', 'Luc', 'evil', 'lover', 'accomplice', 'again', ""n't"", 'have', 'pure', 'evil', 'Bai', 'Ling', 'Myra', 'THE', 'CROW', 'Thuy', 'Trang', 'Kali', 'CROW', 'CITY', 'OF', 'ANGELS', 'other', 'members', 'Luc', 'Four', 'Horsemen', 'do', ""n't"", 'convey', 'evil', 'unredeeming', 'quality', 'fact', 'film', 'are', 'poor', 'slobs', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'manipulated', 'Luc', 'being', 'henchmen.In', 'short', 'want', 'have', 'complete', 'collection', 'THE', 'CROW', 'films', 'would', 'recommend', 'buying', 'one', 'good', 'not', 'great', ""n't"", 'quite', 'meet', 'standards', 'previous', 'three', 'films', 'set', 'Here', 'hoping', 'CROW', 'film', 'made', 'next', 'director', 'screenwriter', 'learn', 'what', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'here']",N/A

891240,AHSY48775P8RI,B0007US7DA,Avalon Daughter,"[5, 8]","I think it was morbid curiosity that made me want to see this.  After all, it had a fairly great cast, interesting choices, some raised an eyebrow (*ahem* Tara Reid and Edward Furlong... could they sober up for this?) and of course, the whole plot of another crow, another storyline based on the crow.  Since I liked the first, the second was bad, the third not-so-bad I had to watch this.  Plus, it was just held back from being released so long, (that's always a dead giveaway) I just knew this was a trainwreck waiting to be watched but wanted to give it a chance.  Oh, I was wrong.  I'm an optimist usually; I like to see the best in things but this was just bad.Whelp, we have another crow story.  This time, out in the desert and playing off the whole Native American aspect.  The film starts kind of artsy and has a ""Pulp Fiction"" feel to it and moves a bit slowly but not bad.  Little bit of corn here and there but tolerable.  The first act:  not bad.The movie was based on one of the Crow graphic novel series that continued after James O'Barr's original.  So basically the plot wasn't pulled out of some Hollywood writer's butt, it was adapted.  Furlong is a down-and-out social outcast who is simply in love with the sweetheart of the town.  Think of Romeo and Juliet.Enter the four horsemen of the apocalypse.  Yeah, it's kind of cheesy that they all have those names, but in the first they were just as cheesy (Fun Boy, anyone?)  Alright, let that slide.  They're out to get revenge on... I think it was the fact a coal mine is being shut down by the reservation to put up a casino.... yeah, the plot is that confusing.  But Luc is going to invoke the power of Satan and become immortal.  To do this, they need specific sacrifices, hence, Furlong and his sweetie will do!The second act is where is starts to become a mess.  Character development is let go completely to introduce a plot that is so messy and confusing that you start to become lost. It borrows too much from the original storyline to really have legs of it's own to stand on and you think: ""Oh yeah, this is going to happen.""  Even that is tolerable until you listen to the wise cracking delivery and start to cringe.Third act falls flat on it's face.  First off, the bloopers are completely visible (which I can't reveal due to spoilers if you actually want to watch it) and the plot stutters around as if it's completely mental.  The end is so cheesy you could spread it on a Ritz cracker.  Boreanez is SO annoying towards the end that it really is painful to watch.  The direction and writing are completely to blame at this part and it's unfortunate because it does seem as if the actors really are trying.Edward Furlong was an interesting choice.  Considering he was an excellent actor in the past and now is more famous for looking puffy-eyed and drugged up in tabloids, I wondered how he'd fare in this role.  He seemed to give it all he had but held back only slightly for whatever reason he chose to.  I get the impression in the first love scene that Emmanuelle Chriqui was disgusted by him because he has his arms around her and she actually seems like she's cringing away from him for some reason.  I think he was just too young to play this role.Tara Reid, dare I say it, wasn't that bad.  She seemed alright in her role of evil mole and her display of emotions was pretty good.  Considering I think she's an idiot, I was surprised she was pretty good.David Boreanez was disappointing.  If you've ever seen Angel, then you know he was playing ""Angelis"" in the role; Wise-cracking to the point of annoying, ridiculous and cheesy, his smart alec comments start alright and then get downright embarrasing.Considering Tara and David didn't even attend the premiere of this flick, I think even they knew it was going to be bad.This is a total trainwreck - not a watchable one either.  It's got that ""Star Wars Holiday Special"" feel to it; You either cringe or start fast-forwarding through it.My recommendation: die hard fans who've tolerated the sequels MAY enjoy a new storyline but will be heavily disappointed by the deliverance of this one.  The original Crow was Goth in it's prime and this one is nothing more than a poorly adapted knock-off.Sunday afternoon viewing only: if you're completely bored, nothing's on... and you're confined to a jail cell somewhere that you can't do anything else.",1,Starts flying upwards then swan dives straight down,1150934400,"06 22, 2006",2006,4389,"['think', 'was', 'morbid', 'curiosity', 'made', 'want', 'see', 'had', 'fairly', 'great', 'cast', 'interesting', 'choices', 'raised', 'eyebrow', '*ahem*', 'Tara', 'Reid', 'Edward', 'Furlong', 'could', 'sober', 'up', 'course', 'whole', 'plot', 'crow', 'storyline', 'based', 'crow', 'liked', 'first', 'second', 'was', 'bad', 'third', 'not-so-bad', 'had', 'watch', 'was', 'just', 'held', 'back', 'being', 'released', 'so', 'long', 'always', 'dead', 'giveaway', 'just', 'knew', 'was', 'trainwreck', 'waiting', 'be', 'watched', 'wanted', 'give', 'chance', 'Oh', 'was', 'wrong', ""'m"", 'optimist', 'usually', 'like', 'see', 'best', 'things', 'was', 'just', 'bad.Whelp', 'have', 'crow', 'story', 'time', 'desert', 'playing', 'off', 'whole', 'Native', 'American', 'aspect', 'film', 'kind', 'artsy', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'feel', 'bit', 'slowly', 'not', 'bad', 'Little', 'bit', 'corn', 'here', 'there', 'tolerable', 'first', 'act', 'not', 'bad.The', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'one', 'Crow', 'graphic', 'novel', 'series', 'continued', 'James', ""O'Barr"", 'original', 'So', 'basically', 'plot', 'was', ""n't"", 'pulled', 'out', 'Hollywood', 'writer', 'butt', 'was', 'adapted', 'Furlong', 'down-and-out', 'social', 'outcast', 'who', 'simply', 'love', 'sweetheart', 'town', 'Think', 'Romeo', 'Juliet.Enter', 'four', 'horsemen', 'apocalypse', 'Yeah', 'kind', 'cheesy', 'have', 'names', 'first', 'were', 'just', 'cheesy', 'Fun', 'Boy', 'anyone', 'Alright', 'let', 'slide', ""'re"", 'out', 'get', 'revenge', 'think', 'was', 'fact', 'coal', 'mine', 'being', 'shut', 'down', 'reservation', 'put', 'up', 'casino', 'yeah', 'plot', 'confusing', 'Luc', 'going', 'invoke', 'power', 'Satan', 'become', 'immortal', 'do', 'need', 'specific', 'sacrifices', 'hence', 'Furlong', 'sweetie', 'will', 'do', 'second', 'act', 'where', 'become', 'mess', 'Character', 'development', 'let', 'go', 'completely', 'introduce', 'plot', 'so', 'messy', 'confusing', 'start', 'become', 'lost', 'too', 'much', 'original', 'storyline', 'really', 'have', 'legs', 'own', 'stand', 'think', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'going', 'happen', 'Even', 'tolerable', 'listen', 'wise', 'cracking', 'delivery', 'start', 'cringe.Third', 'act', 'flat', 'face', 'First', 'bloopers', 'are', 'completely', 'visible', 'ca', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'due', 'spoilers', 'actually', 'want', 'watch', 'plot', 'stutters', 'completely', 'mental', 'end', 'so', 'cheesy', 'could', 'spread', 'Ritz', 'cracker', 'Boreanez', 'SO', 'annoying', 'towards', 'end', 'really', 'painful', 'watch', 'direction', 'writing', 'are', 'completely', 'blame', 'part', 'unfortunate', 'seem', 'actors', 'really', 'are', 'trying.Edward', 'Furlong', 'was', 'interesting', 'choice', 'Considering', 'was', 'excellent', 'actor', 'past', 'now', 'more', 'famous', 'looking', 'puffy-eyed', 'drugged', 'up', 'tabloids', 'wondered', 'how', ""'d"", 'fare', 'role', 'seemed', 'give', 'had', 'held', 'back', 'only', 'slightly', 'reason', 'chose', 'get', 'impression', 'first', 'love', 'scene', 'Emmanuelle', 'Chriqui', 'was', 'disgusted', 'arms', 'actually', 'cringing', 'away', 'reason', 'think', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'young', 'play', 'role.Tara', 'Reid', 'dare', 'say', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'seemed', 'alright', 'role', 'evil', 'mole', 'display', 'emotions', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'Considering', 'think', 'idiot', 'was', 'surprised', 'was', 'pretty', 'good.David', 'Boreanez', 'was', 'disappointing', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Angel', 'then', 'know', 'was', 'playing', 'Angelis', 'role', 'Wise-cracking', 'point', 'annoying', 'ridiculous', 'cheesy', 'smart', 'alec', 'comments', 'start', 'alright', 'then', 'get', 'downright', 'embarrasing.Considering', 'Tara', 'David', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'attend', 'premiere', 'flick', 'think', 'even', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'bad.This', 'total', 'trainwreck', 'not', 'watchable', 'one', 'either', 'got', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Holiday', 'Special', 'feel', 'either', 'cringe', 'start', 'fast-forwarding', 'it.My', 'recommendation', 'die', 'hard', 'fans', 'who', ""'ve"", 'tolerated', 'sequels', 'MAY', 'enjoy', 'new', 'storyline', 'will', 'be', 'heavily', 'disappointed', 'deliverance', 'one', 'original', 'Crow', 'was', 'Goth', 'prime', 'one', 'nothing', 'more', 'poorly', 'adapted', 'knock-off.Sunday', 'afternoon', 'viewing', 'only', ""'re"", 'completely', 'bored', 'nothing', ""'re"", 'confined', 'jail', 'cell', 'somewhere', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'else']",N/A

The story is believeable, the problem is the low budget that made the fight scenes kinda phony cause they could've been alot more realistic & the dance to revive the crow was a little weird but it suited the film none-the-less! another part of the problem was Luke(David Boreanaz) channelling Satan towards the end of the film, his acting started to get over-the-top but thankfully, it didn't last too long. & Dennis Hopper was also a mis-cast here delivering gangsta lingo that doesn't suit the film at all. however, there is alot to like about this film at the same time! unlike the rest of the films, we get flashbacks of Luke's & Lola's(Tara Reid) life, showing why they would be doing the things they are doing now!Now to the plot: After mining shaft is shut down to build a casino, gang members decide to take revenge & the lead member(Luke) looks to literally raise hell! The protagonist in this film, Jimmy Cuervo(Furlong) is anything but a hero. an ex-con who murdered a guy who was trying to rape Jimmy's girlfriend when in his teens. He is hated by many in town except for Lily(Emmanuelle Chriqui) who sees the good inside of him & is the only thing that keeps him from remaining sane throughout the film! if not for Lily, Jimmy himself would probably be aiding Luke in causing terror around the town. One day, Jimmy goes to propose to his girlfriend when Luke & Lola show up and murder the two of them for a ritual that will help Lola see the future and like Lily used to, she can see the good & bad in people! Luke, on the other hand, becomes amazingly powerful through this ritual. shortly after, Jimmy is revived by the Crow & is deeply torn. He doesn't want to be alive, he wants to be with Lily. the first thing he does is try to kill himself but finds himself invinceable. so with nothing left to do, he decides to take his revenge against Luke & save many lives that Luke is planning to take. but he'll need some help after Luke kills the crow that's keeping him here.the acting: Edward Furlong- He has the best role here and delivers a powerful performance as Jimmy/The Crow! I think he saved the movie for the most part as he delivered a few good lines that were spot on!David Boreanaz- Falls apart with his Satan channelling like I said above but the majority of the film is does an excellent job conveying the good & bad in Luke! he shows real depth though not as good as he was on Angel, he does a fine job!Tara Reid- People should give her credit for trying something different! I thought she did a fine job cause her character shows alot of depth throughout the story! I don't know why anyone doubts her talent here, most of the people I talked were surprised how good she was! I didn't expect anything from so this was a definite surprise!Emmanuelle Chriqui- Owns this film! without her, Edward's performance wouldn't have meant so much. the two of them can balance out and hold the film together for some of the best scenes in this film have the two of them in it! She's a hell of an actress and does an excellent job conveying the heart & soul her character needed! she shows true passion for the role! too bad I couldn't say the same about the next actor.Dennis Hopper- I said it before, I'll say it again: No to the gangsta lingo. wasn't his choice but still, out of place, it was just ridiculous.Macy Gray- Brief & unimportant role in this film. she's not very good either. thank God her role doesn't last more then a minute, otherwise, I would've hated this film.The rest of the cast is virtually unknown's, to me anywayz. they are all fairly convincing!The Soundtrack- Ok, this film is set in the desert. would be so ridiculous to have rock tracks in this film. wouldn't suit it at all. instead, they have all instrumental, very unique music that suits the setting perfectly! I'm actually disappointed they didn't have a soundtrack for this movie.anywayz, I think the acting, the settings, the soundtrack & for the most part, the plot, held this film together! the plot in this film, mine closed to build a casino brings depth to the film that makes everything in this film seem more real! this is a good film, might not be everyone's cup of tea but cause of the low budget and the stupid Luke zooming everywhere toward the end of the movie, it looks worse then it is and people therefore will give it a low rating. but there's alot to like about and I DO RECOMMEND it!",4,this film is being highly un-recognized,1168819200,"01 15, 2007",2007,4659,"['were', 'going', 'film', 'thinking', 'going', 'be', 'as', 'great', 'first', 'one', 'then', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'end', 'up', 'disappointed', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'alot', 'bad', 'reviews', 'film', 'film', 'Crow', 'films', 'only', 'one', 'depth', 'villains', 'story', 'believeable', 'problem', 'low', 'budget', 'made', 'fight', 'scenes', 'kinda', 'phony', 'cause', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'alot', 'more', 'realistic', 'dance', 'revive', 'crow', 'was', 'little', 'weird', 'suited', 'film', 'none-the-less', 'part', 'problem', 'was', 'Luke', 'David', 'Boreanaz', 'channelling', 'Satan', 'end', 'film', 'acting', 'started', 'get', 'over-the-top', 'thankfully', 'did', ""n't"", 'last', 'too', 'long', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'was', 'also', 'mis-cast', 'here', 'delivering', 'gangsta', 'lingo', ""n't"", 'suit', 'film', 'however', 'alot', 'like', 'film', 'same', 'time', 'rest', 'films', 'get', 'flashbacks', 'Luke', 'Lola', 'Tara', 'Reid', 'life', 'showing', 'why', 'would', 'be', 'doing', 'things', 'are', 'doing', 'now', 'Now', 'plot', 'mining', 'shaft', 'shut', 'down', 'build', 'casino', 'gang', 'members', 'decide', 'take', 'revenge', 'lead', 'member', 'Luke', 'literally', 'raise', 'hell', 'protagonist', 'film', 'Jimmy', 'Cuervo', 'Furlong', 'anything', 'hero', 'ex-con', 'who', 'murdered', 'guy', 'who', 'was', 'trying', 'rape', 'Jimmy', 'girlfriend', 'when', 'teens', 'hated', 'many', 'town', 'Lily', 'Emmanuelle', 'Chriqui', 'who', 'good', 'inside', 'only', 'thing', 'remaining', 'sane', 'film', 'not', 'Lily', 'Jimmy', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'aiding', 'Luke', 'causing', 'terror', 'town', 'One', 'day', 'Jimmy', 'propose', 'girlfriend', 'when', 'Luke', 'Lola', 'show', 'up', 'murder', 'two', 'ritual', 'will', 'help', 'Lola', 'see', 'future', 'Lily', 'used', 'can', 'see', 'good', 'bad', 'people', 'Luke', 'other', 'hand', 'amazingly', 'powerful', 'ritual', 'shortly', 'Jimmy', 'revived', 'Crow', 'deeply', 'torn', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'alive', 'be', 'Lily', 'first', 'thing', 'try', 'kill', 'invinceable', 'so', 'nothing', 'left', 'do', 'take', 'revenge', 'Luke', 'save', 'many', 'lives', 'Luke', 'planning', 'take', ""'ll"", 'need', 'help', 'Luke', 'crow', 'keeping', 'here.the', 'acting', 'Edward', 'Furlong-', 'best', 'role', 'here', 'powerful', 'performance', 'Jimmy/The', 'Crow', 'think', 'saved', 'movie', 'most', 'part', 'delivered', 'few', 'good', 'lines', 'were', 'spot', 'David', 'Boreanaz-', 'Falls', 'apart', 'Satan', 'channelling', 'said', 'majority', 'film', 'excellent', 'job', 'conveying', 'good', 'bad', 'Luke', 'real', 'depth', 'though', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'was', 'Angel', 'fine', 'job', 'Tara', 'Reid-', 'People', 'should', 'give', 'credit', 'trying', 'something', 'different', 'thought', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'cause', 'character', 'alot', 'depth', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'anyone', 'talent', 'here', 'most', 'people', 'talked', 'were', 'surprised', 'how', 'good', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'anything', 'was', 'definite', 'surprise', 'Emmanuelle', 'Chriqui-', 'Owns', 'film', 'Edward', 'performance', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'meant', 'so', 'much', 'two', 'can', 'balance', 'out', 'hold', 'film', 'together', 'best', 'scenes', 'film', 'have', 'two', 'hell', 'actress', 'excellent', 'job', 'conveying', 'heart', 'soul', 'character', 'needed', 'true', 'passion', 'role', 'too', 'bad', 'could', ""n't"", 'say', 'same', 'next', 'actor.Dennis', 'Hopper-', 'said', ""'ll"", 'say', 'again', 'No', 'gangsta', 'lingo', 'was', ""n't"", 'choice', 'still', 'place', 'was', 'just', 'ridiculous.Macy', 'Gray-', 'Brief', 'unimportant', 'role', 'film', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'either', 'thank', 'God', 'role', ""n't"", 'last', 'more', 'then', 'minute', 'otherwise', 'would', ""'ve"", 'hated', 'film.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'virtually', 'unknown', 'anywayz', 'are', 'fairly', 'convincing', 'Soundtrack-', 'Ok', 'film', 'set', 'desert', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'ridiculous', 'have', 'rock', 'tracks', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'suit', 'instead', 'have', 'instrumental', 'very', 'unique', 'music', 'suits', 'setting', 'perfectly', ""'m"", 'actually', 'disappointed', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'soundtrack', 'movie.anywayz', 'think', 'acting', 'settings', 'soundtrack', 'most', 'part', 'plot', 'held', 'film', 'together', 'plot', 'film', 'mine', 'closed', 'build', 'casino', 'depth', 'film', 'everything', 'film', 'seem', 'more', 'real', 'good', 'film', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'cup', 'tea', 'cause', 'low', 'budget', 'stupid', 'Luke', 'zooming', 'everywhere', 'end', 'movie', 'worse', 'then', 'people', 'therefore', 'will', 'give', 'low', 'rating', 'alot', 'like', 'DO', 'RECOMMEND']",N/A

Dennis Hopper is a Satanic guy, performing a wedding ceremony that's supposed to turn the groom into the devil. It goes like this ""I now pronounce you the devil and his shortie!""

I really wish I had listened to my friends who wasted the money renting this and had not watched it. Furlong is a weakling and a nerd in every movie he plays in, and he doesn't do any better as the crow. This would barely be acceptable if it were a college film shot for a film making class, and is nowhere near good enough to pay money for. The plot might have had potential with a large budget, different actors and a different director. As it is, the acting is terrible with no exception and the movie is nothing but a disappointment.

Sadly, the series has lost most of its edge courtesy of some very mediocre sequels. It now finds itself in the company of franchises like ""Hellraiser"" and ""Children Of The Corn"" as another of Dimension's cheap straight-to-video cash cows.Furlong is Jimmy Cuevro, an ex-con who is murdered along with his Native American girlfriend by a satantic gang led by pretty boy David Boreanaz and party girl Tara Reid. As is the case with every ""Crow"" film, Cuevro is risen from the grave by a crow to exact revenge on his killers. That is really where the ties to the other ""Crow"" films end. Where the original movie was a dark and violent rock n' roll film, ""Wicked Prayer"" is way too laid back in its approach. Furlong has his moments in this movie but he is never really given anything to work with. Boreanaz is far too over-the-top to be effective as the villian and Reid is even less convincing. Her eventual fate in the conclusion of the film is very out of character for a villian in this series. Veterans Dennis Hopper and Danny Trejo are compeletly wasted, particulary Hopper who is thrown in as a ""comic relief"" villian who talks in ebonics. Dreadful.""Wicked Prayer"" would have worked far better if it wasn't released as a ""Crow"" sequel. It takes such a different approach to the subject matter that it is almost guaranteed to dissapoint the majority of die-hard fans. While the movie has a pretty impressive cast, its inability to utilize them properly are probably what pushed it to a straight-to-video release.

891246,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B0007US7DA,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[6, 8]","I had no real desire to watch this movie.  I saw the original Crow movie years ago and, although it was a darn good movie with a great soundtrack, I have never gotten around to watching any of the sequels.  Then I saw all the comments about how awful this film is, and I just had to go ahead and watch it.  Just the fact that Tara Reid is in it is pretty much the kiss of death, and - to no one's surprise - Tara proves once again that she can't act a lick.  The real mystery here, though, is why on earth David Boreanaz signed on to this film.  It's not like his career is teetering on the edge; this must have come along before the offer to star in TV's Bones, or maybe he just got drunk one night and signed the deal without knowing what he was doing.  I suspect, though, he just wanted the chance to play an unambiguously evil character.  For awhile, it looked like he might come out of this relatively unscathed, then he made a complete fool of himself in the movie's final scenes, taking atrocious dialogue and actually making it worse than it already was.  Dennis Hopper's appearance, I can understand.  He seems to jump at any chance for a cameo, especially if the character is a spaced-out loony.  Ah, but what of The Crow himself?  Edward Furlong?  I'm sorry, but old Eddie makes for the least intimidating Crow of all time.  He looks like a Culture Club reject who could be blown away at any time from a stray puff of wind.We all know the story.  A guy gets murdered, and the proverbial crow, rather than taking his soul on to wherever, restores him to life (or unlife) long enough for him to exact revenge on those who killed him (and, more importantly, killed his woman).  Jimmy Cuervo (Furlong) made the mistake of falling in love with an Indian girl, and that doesn't go over well on the reservation.  In fact, it leads to a necktie party for two arranged by an escaped con and his gang of Satanic cult tag-alongs.  Luc Crash (Boreanaz) isn't just an evil guy; he has designs on the role of AntiChrist.  He also has the ultimate trashy girlfriend in Lola Byrne (Tara Reid).  Anyway, he and his gang of Four Horsemen go around committing mass murder without the cops even noticing, while Eddie (now The Crow) slithers around and gets his butt kicked on a routine basis.  Then we get into some increasingly silly business with devil worshipping, spell-casting, virgin-sacrificing, Satanic mumbo jumbo which gives us - who else - but Satan himself.  And, wouldn't you know it, Satan fancies himself quite a standup comedian.  (Why do they always portray Satan in such a ridiculous way?)  Trite, trite, trite - and silly.  Maybe a halfway impressive Crow could have salvaged something from this movie, but I doubt it.  I just don't see Crow enthusiasts (or anyone else, for that matter) getting anything out of this movie at all.

Second, to any people who complain about people complaining about how bad this movie was don't be mad at them be mad at Dimension Films and Lance Mungia who made this mess called ""The Crow: Wicked Prayer"". The fact that people complain about people complaining, only reiterates the fact that it was a sucky film which it was, yet some people are too immature (as always) to accept the truth. I've reviewed many movies both good and bad, so I am a good judge of character and let me tell you that this movie is a horrible movie.Crow fans definitely then have a right to express their displeasure with this trash.

LolI gotta admit read some reviews about the movie saying it sucked, after seeing it for myself I have to say those critics were right!!The movie has no suspsense, no real good acting to speak with the exception of David Boreanaz.Tara Reid once again plays a stupid bimbo that will just reiterate the fact that she's a pretty face that can't act beyond playing a floozy.And Edward Furlong....my God Edward Furlong he's just pretty damn awful. He looks more like a girl than the original crow ever did. He plays the guy whose girlfriend gets murdered, butin actually he should have been called the loser nerd. At least Jason Lee from Dracula III had the build to pass himself as a wannabee hero but not Furlong.There are some ok action scenes but nothing that really compels the video for repeated viewing, nothing here is really that original.

891253,A1Z9OQG9GZ26X2,B0007US7DA,Joboo,"[22, 30]","First off, for all of you posting reviews and not having seen the film, what are you doing? Ever heard of actually seeing something before you review it?This review is based soley off the film itself, not the DVD, which is not due out for another month and a half. I recently SAW the movie (unlike the other reviewers here) and here is my review of just the film. I originally rated this film 4 crows out of 5 on my site. But given the fact that so many have seen fit to pre-judge this film and rate it a one without seeing it, I have raised my rating here at Amazon to a 5 star so as to balance things out somewhat.Finally, after what seems like a lifetime, THE CROW: WICKED PRAYER had its official premiere at the AMC Pacific Place Theatre in Seattle Washington, on Friday, June 3rd. It will play at the AMC Pacific Place for a week, then it will have a direct to video release on Tuesday, July 19th. This review is purposely low in spoilers and scene specific information. It is not my intent to spoil the movie for you, but to give you my overall opinion.THE CROW: WICKED PRAYER is inspired by the same-name novel by Norman Partridge. The story keeps the desert setting and satanic gang element from the novel, but changes up pretty much everything else. Luc Crash and Lola Byrne (David Boreanaz and Tara Reid respectively) lead a gang called the Four Horseman of the Apocalypse (Marcus Chong, Tito Ortiz & Yuji Okumato round out the gang). They have been individually wronged and together, they seek justice. To realize this justice, they must take the blue eyes of a girl with a Native American heritage and the heart of a killer. Enter Lily Ignites the Dawn and Jimmy Cuervo (Emmanuelle Chrique and Eddie Furlong). Jimmy is about to be free from the shackles that have kept him in town. His plan is to marry Lily and leave town, taking Lily with him. Unfortunately, this is not to be as Lily and Jimmy fall victim to the Four Horesman's plans. Jimmy comes back, empowered by the crow, to take his revenge and stop the gang from completing their satanic ritual. The irony of the story is Jimmy's revenge will mean he saves the town that despises him.LOOKTHE CROW: WICKED PRAYER marks a return to a stylized form of film making. Each scene, especially early on, is like a framed poetic piece of art work. That word ""poetic"" was used by quite a few folks when describing various scenes. The film/story is set in the desert Southwest. Everything has dust/sand on it. There is a natural haze that seemingly lifts once night fall comes. Gone is the urban decay of previous stories. This dusty/dirty atmosphere helps to establish the film as a modern western tale.STORY / ACTIONThis film presents a lot of social issues and those are played out nicely during the film. The local community is odds over the mine in their town being closed to allow for a casino to be built. The one thing that the town can agree on is nobody likes Jimmy Cuervo (Eddie Furlong).  This conflict pits the Native American community against the rest of the community. This conflict, in part, lends to some of the reasons why the Four Horseman gang featured in the film are seeking revenge. The gang believes THEY are righting wrongs. This clash of missions with Jimmy's will make for some interesting discussion by fans. Also, the dislike of Jimmy sets his character up to be a truer representation of the anti-hero created by James O'Barr in his original story. This is the one element that really captured my interest in the script and it is played out beautifully through the film.The story is spiritual in nature. Native American mythos are added to the ever growing mythology of this franchise. The satanic themes presented may or may not appeal to everyone. Some who saw the film with me were a bit bothered by the satanic imagery and themes. It didn't bother me because there is a balance of this super natural element a long with the Native American spirituality and social themes. In my opinion, the satanic element highlights the despair the whole gang is in and represents a reaching out to the easiest way for them to deal with their pain. These people are not entirely evil, which is evidenced through some very well done moments in the story where the gang isn't so sure of themselves. This humanizes these characters that have in previous Crow films been nothing more than cartoon characters lined up for the slaughter. Jimmy could easily have fallen into this gang. Were it not for the love of Lily, he may well have. It is this tip toeing of the line between who is good and evil that makes the story fascinating.Action is straight on, not a lot of martial arts. Wires are used from time to time, but other than that, the action is raw and emotional. There are no car chases, no exaggerated fighting styles. This is bare knuckle action and it fits the setting and story perfectly. I really liked that the action was not over the top.ACTING / DIALOGUEBy far, Eddie Furlong (Jimmy Cuervo/The Crow) gives the best performance in the film; and well he should. This is his film to either make work or not and he brings forth an emotional and tragic performance. He has some great lines and he delivers all of them dead on. Having read the script numerous times, I was anxious to hear/see his delivery of some of my favorite lines. He flat nailed them and in a few cases, really surprised me with a delivery I did not expect.Emmanuelle Chriqui (Lily) who plays Eddie's love interest and catalyst for his return is fantastic. She conveys the beauty, strength and love that the role called for.More so than any previous film in the franchise, Emmanuelle (Lily) has a lot more to do in the story than just being the damsel in distress.David Boreanaz (Luc Crash/Death) does a good job as Luc, though his later scenes channeling Satan are a bit too animated in my opinion. Luckily, he is not Satan for long enough to derail the film, but I would have liked a more reigned in performance when he finally channeled Satan. He does such a good job as Luc, it is a shame he ends the film hamming it up.Tara Reid (Lola Byrne) gives a really subdued and tragic performance, she does a great job. I know she takes a lot of flack for playing the same character over and over, but she does bring an element of tragedy to Lola Byrne.As for the rest of the gang, Marcus Chong (War) is the anchor of the gang and does a great job delivering, in many cases, poetic verses in the midst of chaos. Yuji Okumato (Pestilence) steals practically every scene he is in. He does a great send up of a wannabe cowboy and his ""western"" accent is a hoot. Some may remember him as the villain opposite Ralph Machio in Karate Kid 2. The biggest surprise was Tito Ortiz (Famine).  I half expected him to be totally out of place amongst the ""real"" actors, but he holds his own and is a steady presence.David Ortiz (Sheriff Tanner) is really good. His scenes with Eddie are some of my favorites from an acting/dialogue aspect. Danny Trejo (Harold) is always good and he delivers once again in a supporting role. Rounding out the cast is Rena Owen (Mary), who gives a short, but emotional performance. Richard Cumba (Moses), like Rena, has a short role but makes the most of it. He plays a preacher who has a past with Luc. His confrontation with Luc (Boreanaz) is one of David's best scenes. Daymond John (Proud Foot Joe) is OK, definitely not an actor, though he doesn't have a lot of scenes that require him to ""act"". He does have one of the movie's funniest moments when he comes upon a newly resurrected Jimmy Cuervo.Dennis Hopper (El Nino) is good, albeit he is saddled with some of the worst lines in the movie. I never liked the gansta' lingo his character uses when I read the script and as feared, it sounds as out of place as it reads. Hopper makes what is basically a cameo, so his dialogue is not around long enough to do any real harm. The last performance to speak of is Macy Gray (Cara Mae, bodyguard for Hopper's Nino character). She is.....well, she is Macy Gray. Not even close to being an acting talent, Gray basically is a presence and thankfully, her ""presence"" is short-lived.WHAT KILLED (what I liked the best)The opening sequence, with its tip of the 10 gallon hat to THE GOOD, THE BAD & THE UGLY intro of the gang is great and sets the tone perfectly. Jimmy and Lily's intros are great. It was a nice to actually see both lovers alive at the beginning, where we can see them relate to each other rather than relying on flashbacks to establish their relationship. This adds strength to our empathy/sympathy for Jimmy later on. Jimmy's resurrection is done perfectly, a lot of emotion.The music is absolutely fantastic. Jamie Christopherson's score is THE best, in my opinion, to date.  It uses guitars, harmonicas, brass, all the elements that you would expect from a western setting.This is the first Crow film without the benefit of a rock soundtrack. In my opinion having a score-only soundtrack works perfectly given the desert setting.As I mentioned before, Eddie Furlong's performance is spot on. He has the crux of responsibility in this film and he handles it beautifully. His character is very different from previous Crow films. He is torn when he comes back. He doesn't want to be there, he wants to be with Lily. Eddie does a great job conveying this pain. Eventually he accepts that this is the only way to be with Lily again. Emmanuelle is a dream, you can feel her love for Jimmy and the strength she has.The villains overall are a much improved element over previous sequels. The beauty of this film is for the first time, we see the villains as humans. They have back stories that we are given glimpses into through their introductions and flashback sequences.As I mentioned, Lance's style is great to watch. The camera angles and shots are beautiful. The editing is near flawless with some very nice transition scenes that go from real-time to flashback back to real-time with beautiful results. I would have to say that for the first time in the sequels, we have a very technically sound film here. There was great care and work put into this film during post-production and it shows.Finally, the ending is one of the best since the first film from an emotional level. It is beautifully shot and executed; you will be moved by it. Again, the word ""poetic"" comes up time and again when I look for a way to describe the look and feel of this film.WHAT DIED (stuff I didn't like)My only complaint with the film is the first half of the 3rd act. This is when Luc has channeled Satan and he and Lola are married to further consummate the union. The wedding itself is fine, but as I mentioned before, David Boreanaz, in my opinion, is too far over the top. The dialogue David has during this part of the film is sprinkled with a tongue-n-cheek tone, but his delivery works against the intent, in my opinion. There are a few exceptions, such as when he and Reid are leaving the church he nails a line that is one of his funniest in the film and really got a great reaction. He obviously tries to take a page from Jack Nicholson's slant on the Joker from the first BATMAN film, but goes two pages instead.Hopper's dialogue is cringe worthy in the first half of the 3rd act. I had hoped perhaps the delivery of the lines would improve them from the last script I had read. But as feared, the gangsta' lingo sounds out of place and I wish it would have been changed. Thankfully the 2nd half of the 3rd act gets things back on the right track with a fitting end.FINAL THOUGHTSWell, after much waiting and build up, the film delivered the goods for me. The film for me has been like a road trip. Since my site has covered the pre-production, production and post-production extensively, I feel like we have been a long for the ride. It was a road trip that has seen a lot of detours, missed exits, closed sections of highway and delays. But in the end, through all the miles of traveling and adventures in between, the final destination is worth it.  My only regret about the film is that it will not see a much deserved full fledged theatrical release. It is high quality work and it is a shame that a film like this is not given its just due, especially in light of the films that have been given a theatrical release of late that absolutely tanked at the box office.LLcruize / Co-webmaster of A Boy & His Bird",5,Best Crow sequel to date,1117843200,"06 4, 2005",2005,12393,"['First', 'off', 'posting', 'reviews', 'not', 'having', 'seen', 'film',

Paul ""John doe""","[0, 1]","Crow Wicked Prayer is the 4th film in the Crow franchise unfortantly not the last there going to do a remake which means can it get any worse. Ok Crow Wicked Prayer Edward Furlong as The Crow/Jimmy Cuevo stupid name I know David Boreanaz as Luc Crash Tara Reid was hit or miss as far as this movie goes I just wish she wasn't in this or any movies & she does a terrible job 99% of the time. Emmanuelle Chriqui plays Lily & Dennis Hopper embarasses himself I mean here is a low budget movie there lucky enough to land a big name like Dennis Hopper & they give him a terrible character. So story is Luc Crash is a leader of a group of Devil Warshipers & 1 day they go kill a named Lily & her boyfriend Jimmy Luc & Jimmy were friends at 1 time & Lolo has always been jelous of Lily WOW! (SARCASIM) Well thry're hanged & Famine & Pestliencd dump them 2 henchmen dump them The Crow resurrects Jimmy he goes out to get revenge. Sherrif Tanner who doesn't like Jimmy suspects Jimmy of murdering his sister Luc attacks The Crow it weakens Jimmy that's basically little bit of the plot. Personally I though Edward Furlong was a kick @** Crow he's no Brandon Lee or Vincent Perez but I think he p****s on Eric Mabius. I liked some of the back stories the score was good. Tara Reid OMG she acted like a bad guy in certain scenes then had a disgusted look in others was there an acting coach on hand cause she has always been 1 of the worst actresses of my generation. The puns to Satan really got old fast I had fun with Boreanaz (sew me) even Hopper was funny El Nino: I now pronounce you devil and his shorty!Lola Byrne: I love you, Lucifer.El Nino: Well, kiss the bride, mother f***er! I like the line ""Quote the Raven Mother F***er sew me. In closing I think Edward Furlong P****s on Crow Salvation I do think the acting is average but sugar coated s**t is s**t in both I don't know why there remaking the Crow cause the sequels didn't make any money even though I like Crow City Of Angles it didn't do well in theaters. Salvation was going to be in theaters but was direct to video so was Wicked Prayer there's only a 20% chance that the reboot will be in theaters there's no but about it will never go back to that magic that of Brandon Lee or Vincent Perez.

Cuervo's love for the daughter of a local pastor causes much concern in the town, because of Cuervo's questionable past in which he allegedly murdered a man.  Jimmy and his love are happy together, even though many would love to see them broken apart; however, happiness is not long for the couple as a satanic cult led by Luc Crash (David Boreanaz) and his girlfriend (Tara Reid), kill the couple in a satanic ritual designed to bring forth the Apocalypse.  Jimmy is resurrected by the mysterious 'Crow' and sets out on his quest for vengeance and to clear his name once and for all.I knew that I would probably like this movie, though I thought I would end up a little disappointed, since this was the fourth film in the franchise and would most likely not present that much of a difference from any of the previous films.  However, I was wrong, with the addition of the exploration of the series' mythology, and having the new 'Crow' not be as innocent a victim as the previous incarnations, this film brought some fresh, new ideas to the franchise.  Another nice touch on the part of the filmmakers, was that of changing the environment, removing the urban locations and setting the film in the west, allowed for a nice change of scenery and provided the filmmakers a great outlet for explaining the mythology behind the legend of the 'Crow'.With solid acting and storytelling, ""The Crow: Wicked Prayer"" delivers audiences another engrossing tale of justice, while continuing to build on the legend of the 'Crow'.

Upon getting to the point where the mexican/native american (never knew for sure which) does the crow dance to heal the bird I was a goner. I had to fast forward it through the rest of the film. I can't believe that someone read this script and said ""I'll give away money to make that!""The acting wasn't overly bad, mostly just a bad story.

891258,A29W1OLYB6I8AI,B0007US7DA,MegsJedi,"[7, 17]","This film, of all the sequels, matches the original the most. Beautiful story, and performances par excellance from Edward Furlong and David Boreanaz (they finally prove that they're not just a kid carried around by a Terminator and a tormented vampire with a soul).Perhaps the movie's story doesn't directly coicide with the book, but I can forgive that, I'm not that much of a purist. Heck, look at the Brandon Lee film and compare it to the graphic novel! They only share a passing resemblance with each other.The story of Jimmy Cuervo and Lily Ignites-The-Dawn is a poignant Romeo and Juliet romance. Lily fights to prove to everyone that Jimmy is a truly good person at heart, despite a terrible mistake he made in the past; all Jimmy wants is Lily, and to have people just leave him alone.Of course, neither Jimmy or Lily get their wish. Just before they can run away to get married and live in peace, Luc Crash pops into their lives, along with his girlfriend Lola, and companions Pestilence, Famine, and War. Needless to say, Crash himself is Death. Jimmy and Crash used to be friends, in high school and in jail. Crash has a bad repayment of friendship in mind: killing Lily and Jimmy, tearing out Jimmy's heart so he can stick it in his own chest, then allowing his girlfriend to steal Lily's eyes so she can have magical Sight, and prepares to cast dark magic that will open a door to the underworld and let Lucifer out.When the Crow arrives to help Jimmy put the wrong back to right, the story evolves to the darkly beautiful and stark world of raging vengeance.

I beg you -- nay! -- I PLEAD with you never, ever to waste a second of your life watching it. The only wickedness here would be if you didn't heed my advice and coughed up a Ballbuster rental fee. The fact that Jay O'Barr, who penned the original ""Crow"" graphic novel and fought tooth and nail along with Brandon Lee to get it made into a movie the right way, has his name tacked onto the credits of this dreck is truly an insult to that tortured genius. I remember an interview from the original Crow DVD where he equated his idea to a beautiful tree that witless studio executives lined up to p*** on. Well, Jay, it looks like their bladders are still tragically full.Painful as the subject is (excuse me while I dose myself with morphine....aaaah) I shall now discuss the movie. Basically, this fourth entry (there was a third?) in the ""Crow"" series finds a reformed ex-con played by Edward Furlong  and his honey getting offed by a cult of Satanic-worshipping muscle-car driving baddies led by David (""Buffy/Angel/Bones"") Boreanaz and Tara ""Psychic Network Here I Come!"" Reid, who want to....oh, to hell with it. Who cares? The plot is utter gibberish, basically an excuse to put Furlong in Brandon Lee's facepaint, a job for which this tyke is woefully inadequate, since Furlong is every bit as intimidating as Gumby.Okay, the plot is nonsense. So what else is wrong with it, the audience asks? Well, unlike Boreanaz's ""Angel"", I am not immortal, so I'll just stick to the main points:1)The writing. Dreadful, just bloody dreadful. The writing in the later sequels to the ""Friday the 13th"" films actually seem like masterworks in comparison.2) The editing. The film flows like it was thrown in a wood chipper and re-assembled by an octopus.3)The sound. I couldn't hear half of what was said. Oh, no, wait....on second thought that's a blessing.4) The complete, utter lack of atmosphere. The original ""Crow"" was urban film noir at its best. What the hell happened?5) The acting. No actor could possibly choke out dialogue this bad and look good. Tara Reid looks like she got hit over the head with a shovel --probably shock from realizing her career is now offically a trivia question on Jeopardy. And David Boreanaz never comes close to the brilliant nastiness he produced playing Angelus on ""Buffy"" and ""Angel."" Why? See #1.I could go on to points 6 - 600 but why bother? This flick is a classic example of Hollywood kicking a once-proud idea to death in the hopes of knocking a few last few coins out of the corpse.

891260,AUZQPGY3KSXSF,B0007US7DA,Michael Bryan Kidd,"[6, 13]","First of all, I haven't seen this movie, yet I'm giving it a five star rating. Why you ask? Because I'd rather assume good things than bad, unlike a lot of people that come to spread negativity about something they are just as clueless as I am about. And frankly, this series of movies has been far stronger than most that are released into theatres. The first was perfect in my opinion, and can never be duplicated. Yet they decided to do a sequel. There's no reason not to, since it deals with completely new characters, with the exception of Sarah. City of Angels, unfortunately tried to copy elements of the first and thusly set itself up for criticism for copying the original. But it was good when looked at without the shadow of the first looming over it.Another problem with City of Angels was that it dealt with a father who lost his son, which isn't an attachment everyone will appreciate. Almost everyone has loved someone at some point, which is part of why the first one resonated so well. However, many who are not parents can only imagine the pain of losing a child, so it was harder to reach the same emotional heights the first one did.Salvation was a return to the lost girlfriend idea, but was very differemt in that the Crow of that film wasn't murdered, but was executed for murdering the loved one he came back to avenge. Of course he was innocent, but this was the first of many ideas that hadn't been done before, including not having colorful, comic book style villains.Now for Wicked Prayer. Edward Furlong seems to be very much in the vein of the previous actors in the installments, as he isn't clean cut, but rather a darker person, who has rough edges. This makes him seem an unlikely romantic hero, but he has always seemed to express emotions in different ways. He seems to be a person who hides his feelings under a mask of anger and rebellion. My point in all this is to show that a lot of people seem to be basing their opinions of him on his performance in Terminator 2, when he has built an impressive career since then, and seems to be very capable of channeling the mindset necessary for the Crow.As someone who has seen the first three and eagerly awaits this installment, look at the originals and tell me if they really seem to be lessening in quality. This has been a series with endless possibilities, as the concept is one that everyone can identify with in some respect. So wait until this movie actually comes out to bash it.

So, Furlong and his the girl he loved named Lilly, played by Emmanuelle Chriqui (Wrong Turn) are murdered and soon after Furlong is brought back to life by The Crow so he can take out his vengence on Boreanaz and his crew.

The original ""Crow"" movie was one of the most heart-wrenching and well done cinematic/comic masterpieces ever shot.  It was brutal, it was at times hard to watch, but it was amazing.  Not just because the cast, director, and everyone else involved had put their heart and soul into the movie, but also because it had one element this most recent incarnation of ""The Crow"" is lacking:  story.""The Crow-Wicked Prayer"" is one of biggest movie letdowns I haveperienced in sometime.  As a huge David Boreanaz fan, I was very excited when I first heard about his being cast as the ""badguy"" in this movie.  When I heard Edward Furlong was going to be coming back from the dead to avenge the murder of himself and the girl he loved I was even more psyched because he's perfect for the part.  Unfortunately, the story and director let both the legend of the Crow as well as the actors in this movie down.To be honest, this movie is just boring.  It never really establishes itself as a film and you never really even care about the ""love"" between Jimmy (Furlong) and Lily (a well-cast Emmanuelle Chriqui).  Basically, thentire premise of the Crow is that love can last forever and bring those slighted of their love back from the dead.  However, Lance Mungia did the worst job of selling a love story that I've seen since George Lucas in Star Wars Episode II.  Jimmy and Lily's love was not believable at all.  It definitely did no justice to the love between Eric and Shelley in the original Crow story.  The background story as to why Jimmy is so hated by everyone makes little to no sense, and the feud between the Indians (are they Aztecs?  Mexicans?  Native Americans?  All three?...it makes no sense, I'm not kidding you....) and the white Satanic cult led by Boreanaz is probably the stupidest thing I've ever heard of.  Wait, no, it's not the stupidest thing I ever heard of, hearing Dennis Hopper call Tara Reid his ""shorty"" and David Boreanaz ""the original homey (ie: Satan)"" are even more stupid.  Dennis Hopper's character is never even introduced and is ridiculous.  He's some sort of pimp and apparently, Tara Reid worked for him at some early time, but then Boreanaz came along and saved her or something...Do you see what I'm getting at?  There's no story, at least not one that makes any sense or is enjoyable at all to follow...it's the most contrived stupid thing I've watched since Starship Troopers 2.Finally, the action sequences are ridiculously lame.  I understand this movie had a low budget, but there were better and more expensive stunts on Buffy, Angel, and probably even Quantum Leap.  Oh yeah, and seeing Boreanaz in his boxers as he crazily tries to have sex with Reid is one of the worst images that I've ever had to see....it was just horrible.I give this movie 2 stars instead of 1 because Edward Furlong really tried to make it work.  He was great in the make-up and I think he was the only person who cared about this movie at all.  Chriqui also did her best, but honestly there's not much acting needed when you're just playing a dead girl.

891267,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B0007US7DA,"N. Durham ""Big Evil""","[43, 47]","Miramax just keeps beating a dead horse.  The original Crow film, forever remembered as the film that would have shot star Brandon Lee to superstardom if not for his tragic death during filming, was somber in it's tone but was an excellent action film and undoubtadly one of the best comic to film adaptations of all time.  Not long later, a sequel (Crow: City of Angels) was churned out based soley on the first film's success, and it was an absolute waste of film.  The third film (Crow: Salvation) wasn't quite as bad, but marked the first film in the series to be released direct to video, and when watching you can see why.  And now, we have the Crow: Wicked Prayer; the fourth film in the series, and the second to be released direct to video.  The storyline (if you can call it that) revolves around an ex-con Jimmy (Terminator 2's Edward Furlong) and his Native American girlfriend who are murdered by a Satanic biker gang (led by David ""Angel"" Boreanaz and has-been in the making Tara Reid), leading to Jimmy's ressurection as the latest incarnation of the Crow.  The first thing you'll notice from the film is the absolutely horrible acting from everyone involved, whether it's Furlong slumming through his role to Boreanaz hamming it up in the film's climax as a wanna-be comedian Satan.  Not to mention that poor old Dennis Hopper is here as well, but for no real reason.  The storyline is devoid of any emotion or conviction, and what has happened to the soundtrack?  Every Crow movie, no matter how bad one could have been, would have a great soundtrack, and Wicked Prayer certainly doesn't.  I wouldn't even recommend this to the most die hard fan of the series, Wicked Prayer is an abomination of film and it's license, and it should be avoided by everyone.",1,An abomination of film and license,1131321600,"11 7, 2005",2005,1773,"['Miramax', 'just', 'beating', 'dead', 'horse', 'original', 'Crow', 'film', 'forever', 'remembered', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'shot', 'star', 'Brandon', 'Lee', 'superstardom', 'not', 'tragic', 'death', 'filming', 'was', 'somber', 'tone', 'was', 'excellent', 'action', 'film', 'undoubtadly', 'one', 'best', 'comic', 'film', 'adaptations', 'time', 'Not', 'long', 'later', 'sequel', 'Crow', 'City', 'Angels', 'was', 'churned', 'out', 'based', 'soley', 'first', 'film', 'success', 'was', 'absolute', 'waste', 'film', 'third', 'film', 'Crow', 'Salvation', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'bad', 'marked', 'first', 'film', 'series', 'be', 'released', 'direct', 'video', 'when', 'watching', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'now', 'have', 'Crow', 'Wicked', 'Prayer', 'fourth', 'film', 'series', 'second', 'be', 'released', 'direct', 'video', 'storyline', 'can', 'call', 'ex-con', 'Jimmy', 'Terminator', '2', 'Edward', 'Furlong', 'Native', 'American', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'are', 'murdered', 'Satanic', 'biker', 'gang', 'led', 'David', 'Angel', 'Boreanaz', 'has-been', 'making', 'Tara', 'Reid', 'leading', 'Jimmy', 'ressurection', 'latest', 'incarnation', 'Crow', 'first', 'thing', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'film', 'absolutely', 'horrible', 'acting', 'everyone', 'involved', 'Furlong', 'slumming', 'role', 'Boreanaz', 'hamming', 'up', 'film', 'climax', 'wanna-be', 'comedian', 'Satan', 'Not', 'mention', 'poor', 'old', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'real', 'reason', 'storyline', 'devoid', 'emotion', 'conviction', 'happened', 'soundtrack', 'Crow', 'movie', 'matter', 'how', 'bad', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'would', 'have', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'Wicked', 'Prayer', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'recommend', 'most', 'die', 'hard', 'fan', 'series', 'Wicked', 'Prayer', 'abomination', 'film', 'license', 'should', 'be', 'avoided', 'everyone']",N/A

Everything from the quality of the type of film used to the sets screams ""B"" movie.  I was also pleasantly surprised because in my opinion the actors in the previous ""Crow"" films before this were unable to pull off the look that is essential to the ""Crow"" character.  Edward Furlong does not pull it off extraordinarily well, but he does pull it off, unlike either Eric Mabius or Vincent Perez.  In order to pull it off he/she has to be tortured, yet enraged, and somewhat pathetic all at the same.  If for no other reason the fact that Edward Furlong can pull that off makes this the only semi-decent ""Crow"" film since the original.It is about Jimmy who is in love with Lily but went to prison after killing a guy who tried to rape her.  There he met Luc Crash and befriended him.  After Jimmy got out and off of probation he and Lily planned to leave the reservation where she lives to start a new life.  However Luc, his girlfriend Lola, and a few of their friends plan to resurrect the antichrist and they sacrifice both Jimmy and Lily in order to do that.  The devil enters Luc's body, at least partially, and in order to stay he has to have sex and if he doesn't the devil will return to hell at dawn the next morning.  But later that same night a crow brings Jimmy's spirit back to his body.  Jimmy starts killing off each of Luc's friends one by one.  Jimmy, also in his own way, makes amends with people that he had wronged while he was alive.  Luc and Lola go to El Nino, the head of a devil worshipping church and he marries them.  The Devil fully enters Luc's body.  Luc injures the crow  and the local indians, knowing that what will happen if Luc is not stopped and also knowing that Jimmy is the only hope for stopping him, heal the crow and Jimmy gets his powers back and gets better.  Inevitably Jimmy stops Luc and Lola from having sex, the devil returns to hell, Luc dies, and Lola will soon be arrested and sent to prison for Lily's murder.  Jimmy lays down and dies, for good, this time.  Jimmy's soul is now at peace and happily joins Lily's soul in the afterlife.This film, while being half-way decent, in the most basic ways does copy the original ""Crow"" script with the ""Crow"" getting even with the bad guys, getting retribution for himself, being injured and getting better, and finally being reunited with his soulmate.  Although, this is a ""B"" film, the actors procured to play some of the larger roles are pretty good. I would reccommend this film to anyone that has a basic appreciation of ""B"" films in general and can also appreciate that sometimes one of the most important things about a role like the ""Crow"" is the ability to pull off the look necessary to the role itself.

Did they forget that the dark, damp, cities is what made the previous films look good? And, what was the crow doing? Flying or limping? You just can't tell. And I think one of the make-up artists hated Ed Furlong very much. I had paid a GOOD $50 to watch this movie and this is what I get?! For, all saken, I kept watching even after the make-over of Jimmy as the Crow, hoping this film would turn out good. But, NOOO...... The scenes just kept getting worse.My head started spinning by the time I reached the end. When the credits started rolling, I flung the DVD out of the player, threw it back in the box, then stuffed in a box full of cotton, and threw it in the storage room, hoping no one in my family will ever find it.All this movie is, is a waste of good acting, a waste of directing, and all in out a VERY GOOD waste of time! (And the people flying around stuff? What was the writer, stupid or something? Oh, yeah, he was!)I expected atleast one good-giver for this movie in here, but I was VERY happy when I saw haters' reviews lined up. I hope this dishonour-of-a-movie will not effect all the past and (I hope) future Crow movies.Hope I inspired those Crow fans who haven't watch this movie to further avoid it.The Reviewer With A Heart To Know-Penny-----------------------------------------------------------------ERIC DRAVEN: Mother is the name for god on the lips and hearts of all children.

Man, I guess I'm in the wrong business.  For all these psychics telling us how much this movie will suck before anyone ever views it, must pay well.  So just for that, I'm giving it 4 stars just in spite of all the 1 star ratings.  So nyah!Anyway, I agree with the fella who said 'get off the Brandon Lee' comparisons.  He's right.  Each Crow movie has been about a different character who has risen from the dead thru the power of the crow due to their own circumstances.  The Crow movies are a continuation of Eric Draven's story, they're their own.Is Edward Furlong a wise choice for the new Crow?  Who knows?  He may be pretty good, although his career went down the tubes after T2.  Was Eric Mabius from Crow: Salvation a good one?  Eh, perhaps,  Quite frankly, I thought Crow: City of Angels was not that bad either.  At least they tried to stick close to the ""look"" of the first one with a long-haired ""artist"" look.So here's my advice for future reviewers of this film on Amazon.

891278,AZXHK8IO25FL6,B0007US7DA,ribcage,"[2, 4]","THE CROW: WICKED PRAYER stars Edward Furlong in corpsepaint pretending to be THE CROW, although the credits suppose that he actually is the sorrowful dead come back for vengeance, but I'll believe it when I see it--which I don't in this film.Edward Furlong just can't do anger. Maybe he was a decent hateful little kid in American History X but that was a good while ago, and it looks like his acting has flown right out the window. It was painful to watch.  He just isn't good. The highlight of his performance is a scene where he confronts one of the villains at an outdoor restaurant and stumbles through trying to look angry by first pursing his lips then squinting his eyes. The guy can't show anger. Period. And these movies are all about sorrow and anger.Plus, the film obviously has him marketting to teenie goths, what with him putting the signature Crow makeup on with A SHARPIE. OH AND HE WEARS A CHOKER. He looks like some 15 year old high schooler claiming to be bisexual when he's never kissed anybody but his mom before, let alone having sex with anyone.Next up, Tara Reid is in it in all her plasticy, leathery done up garbage of a wannabe actress nonglory. Every time she had a line I felt like I was being strangled.Oh, and Dennis Hopper is in it with a completely uninspired cameo near the end. He uses rapper gangster lingo for whatever reason. I was pretty sad to see him messing around with this script.And the script is a DOOZY. If you haven't seen the first three, let me fill you in -- they are about a man coming back over sorrow and seeking revenge against corrupt men of power in their cities. It's a formula to be sure, but WICKED PRAYER proves that deviation means destruction.WICKED PRAYER basically starts out as THE CROW: MEXICANS VS. INDIANS in a fight over a mine being shut down. There's some expository text at the beginning that fills you in on what the movie explains itself in the first 15 minutes. I guess they were worried their shoddy filmmaking hadn't made it clear.Anyway, the men of power are some misguided native americans or some such or who cares. The story is about this gang who hates the native americans working to have their leader become an incarnation of Satan, although everyone but the leader keeps having second thoughts about this evil idea every other scene. One minute they're gung-ho the next they are not so sure about hurting people so much.Furlong's sorrow comes when he inadvertantly crosses them gouging out his love's eyes and then being hung alongside her. But it doesn't at all matter, the film is all about this guy becoming the devil.Did I mention no one in the gang can act either? Because they can't.Along the way, Furlong's companion bird(the actual crow that brings about the resurrection) is killed. The thing is, when this happens in the first three films, the resurrected man loses his invincibility. In WICKED PRAYER, the bird dies a couple of times it seems. I'm not sure because the first time wasn't clear. The second time Danny Trejo does a raindance and brings it back to life. But it never mattered anyway because the writer clearly didn't give any thought or care to this whole ""kill the bird, kill the man"" clause in the canon.The whole thing is just absolutely bonkers. It's a terrible, terrible film in its own right, but all the while manages to rape the Crow mythos. There's no reason to watch it. At all. Not as a film. Not for The Crow. Because it's not a Crow film. It's a undead Edward Furlong in corpsepaint with a bird film.",1,an abortion of a movie,1244592000,"06 10, 2009",2009,3524,"['CROW', 'WICKED', 'PRAYER', 'Edward', 'Furlong', 'corpsepaint', 'pretending', 'be', 'THE', 'CROW', 'credits', 'suppose', 'actually', 'sorrowful', 'dead', 'come', 'back', 'vengeance', ""'ll"", 'believe', 'when', 'see', 'do', ""n't"", 'film.Edward', 'Furlong', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'anger', 'Maybe', 'was', 'decent', 'hateful', 'little', 'kid', 'American', 'History', 'X', 'was', 'good', 'while', 'ago', 'acting', 'flown', 'right', 'window', 'was', 'painful', 'watch', 'just', ""n't"", 'good', 'highlight', 'performance', 'scene', 'where', 'one', 'villains', 'outdoor', 'restaurant', 'stumbles', 'trying', 'look', 'angry', 'first', 'pursing', 'lips', 'then', 'squinting', 'eyes', 'guy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'show', 'anger', 'Period', 'movies', 'are', 'sorrow', 'anger.Plus', 'film', 'obviously', 'marketting', 'teenie', 'goths', 'what', 'putting', 'signature', 'Crow', 'makeup', 'A', 'SHARPIE', 'OH', 'HE', 'WEARS', 'CHOKER', '15', 'year', 'old', 'high', 'schooler', 'claiming', 'be', 'bisexual', 'when', 'never', 'kissed', 'anybody', 'mom', 'let', 'alone', 'having', 'sex', 'anyone.Next', 'up', 'Tara', 'Reid', 'plasticy', 'leathery', 'done', 'up', 'garbage', 'wannabe', 'actress', 'nonglory', 'time', 'had', 'line', 'felt', 'was', 'being', 'strangled.Oh', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'completely', 'uninspired', 'cameo', 'end', 'rapper', 'gangster', 'lingo', 'reason', 'was', 'pretty', 'sad', 'see', 'messing', 'around', 'script', 'DOOZY', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'first', 'three', 'let', 'fill', 'are', 'man', 'coming', 'back', 'sorrow', 'seeking', 'revenge', 'corrupt', 'men', 'power', 'cities', 'formula', 'be', 'sure', 'WICKED', 'PRAYER', 'deviation', 'destruction.WICKED', 'PRAYER', 'basically', 'out', 'CROW', 'MEXICANS', 'VS.', 'INDIANS', 'fight', 'mine', 'being', 'shut', 'down', 'expository', 'text', 'beginning', 'what', 'movie', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'guess', 'were', 'worried', 'shoddy', 'filmmaking', 'had', ""n't"", 'made', 'clear.Anyway', 'men', 'power', 'are', 'misguided', 'native', 'americans', 'such', 'who', 'story', 'gang', 'who', 'native', 'americans', 'working', 'have', 'leader', 'become', 'incarnation', 'Satan', 'everyone', 'leader', 'having', 'second', 'thoughts', 'evil', 'idea', 'other', 'scene', 'One', 'minute', ""'re"", 'gung-ho', 'next', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'sure', 'hurting', 'people', 'so', 'much.Furlong', 'sorrow', 'when', 'inadvertantly', 'gouging', 'out', 'love', 'eyes', 'then', 'being', 'hung', ""n't"", 'matter', 'film', 'guy', 'becoming', 'devil.Did', 'mention', 'one', 'gang', 'can', 'act', 'either', ""can't.Along"", 'way', 'Furlong', 'companion', 'bird', 'actual', 'crow', 'resurrection', 'killed', 'thing', 'when', 'first', 'three', 'films', 'resurrected', 'man', 'invincibility', 'WICKED', 'PRAYER', 'bird', 'couple', 'times', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'first', 'time', 'was', ""n't"", 'clear', 'second', 'time', 'Danny', 'Trejo', 'raindance', 'back', 'life', 'never', 'mattered', 'anyway', 'writer', 'clearly', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'thought', 'care', 'whole', 'kill', 'bird', 'kill', 'man', 'clause', 'canon.The', 'whole', 'thing', 'just', 'absolutely', 'bonkers', 'terrible', 'terrible', 'film', 'own', 'right', 'while', 'rape', 'Crow', 'mythos', 'reason', 'watch', 'Not', 'film', 'Not', 'Crow', 'not', 'Crow', 'film', 'undead', 'Edward', 'Furlong', 'corpsepaint', 'bird', 'film']",N/A

If you've seen THE CROW or any of the films that followed, or read the original comics, or any of the books, short stories or on-line fan fictions - then you know exactly what you're getting here.  Despite the better than average cast (almost all of of which give their best - although Dennis Hopper walks through his part - and who can blame him, this is his sixth movie so far in 2005 - and a door must have been left open somewhere and Macy Gray somehow wandered onto the set, and everyone was too polite to ask her to leave, while Edward Furlong makes for a sad clown and has no trouble playing up to the Crow; and David Boreanaz, as always, manages to cross the line of horror, humor and camp effortlessly - and seems to be having a great time playing anything but a vampire), there's nothing here that we haven't seen before.The setting may be different, and a welcome change from the endless CITY AT NIGHT and POURING RAIN, but the story remains firmly fixed in the mythos and lore of the CROW films and backstory.  Instead of making any real changes they simply sprinkle with desert and bake until hot.  There's magic, there's tragic, there's payback, there's some quirk and a smack of humor, all of which ends as happy as any CROW film can.  FADE OUT.  ROLL CREDITS and begin to set up for the next film where we find our hero killed by vile, evil villains who returns to seek vengence from beyond the grave and... oops, sorry, I'm giving too much away...By now it would seem that even the most die hard CROW fans must be looking for something new, a twist that could help to launch the series into a higher orbit, than have it settle in a low one and just coast.  The HELLRAISER films have reached this point, they just roll them out, and it looks like THE CROW is already well on its way.And that's odd since this DVD comes PAKCED with features - there are FOUR (count them: four!) commentary tracks here (Writer/Director. Production. Music/SFX and Actors), all of which hit their marks and go down easily - but they seem to be watching a totally different film.  For all the choices they made (five treatments, several drafts of the script), changing the setting and going for a bigger and better cast (honestly - Tara Reid is pretty good in this film, she plays both a monster and tormented soul very well - it's a shame they didn't go even darker with her character), they still managed to come up with nearly the exact same film as those that have come before it.  No twists, no turns, but just frustrating hints of a better film trying to break out all the time (I kept waiting for the scorpions, which are spotlighted several times in the film, to become part of the story - but they were just coloring, something you're supposed to see in the desert).  Like the Lucas commentaries on his STAR WARS prequels, the commentaires here go a long way here in explaining the ""ideas and intentions"" behind making the film, adding to the picture rich background detail, but leaving you wondering why almost none of it ended up on screen.In the end the film is simply carried by moments, not by surprises or story.  A new setting, some good performances, a few deft touches in direction and production (the star rippling Crow manifestation was a welcome dash of magic), but little else to separate it from the murder.",2,SWING SHIFT,1121817600,"07 20, 2005",2005,3389,"['CROW', 'movie.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'more', 'simple', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'THE', 'CROW', 'films', 'followed', 'read', 'original', 'comics', 'books', 'short', 'stories', 'on-line', 'fan', 'fictions', 'then', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', ""'re"", 'getting', 'here', 'better', 'average', 'cast', 'almost', 'give', 'best', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'part', 'who', 'can', 'blame', 'sixth', 'movie', 'so', 'far', '2005', 'door', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'open', 'somewhere', 'Macy', 'Gray', 'somehow', 'wandered', 'set', 'everyone', 'was', 'too', 'polite', 'ask', 'leave', 'Edward', 'Furlong', 'sad', 'clown', 'trouble', 'playing', 'up', 'Crow', 'David', 'Boreanaz', 'always', 'cross', 'line', 'horror', 'humor', 'camp', 'effortlessly', 'be', 'having', 'great', 'time', 'playing', 'anything', 'vampire', 'nothing', 'here', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before.The', 'setting', 'may', 'be', 'different', 'welcome', 'change', 'endless', 'CITY', 'AT', 'NIGHT', 'POURING', 'RAIN', 'story', 'firmly', 'fixed', 'mythos', 'lore', 'CROW', 'films', 'backstory', 'Instead', 'making', 'real', 'changes', 'simply', 'sprinkle', 'desert', 'bake', 'hot', 'magic', 'tragic', 'payback', 'quirk', 'smack', 'humor', 'as', 'happy', 'CROW', 'film', 'can', 'FADE', 'OUT', 'ROLL', 'CREDITS', 'begin', 'set', 'up', 'next', 'film', 'where', 'find', 'hero', 'killed', 'vile', 'evil', 'villains', 'who', 'returns', 'seek', 'vengence', 'grave', 'oops', 'sorry', ""'m"", 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'now', 'would', 'seem', 'even', 'most', 'die', 'hard', 'CROW', 'fans', 'must', 'be', 'looking', 'something', 'new', 'twist', 'could', 'help', 'launch', 'series', 'higher', 'orbit', 'have', 'settle', 'low', 'one', 'just', 'coast', 'HELLRAISER', 'films', 'have', 'reached', 'point', 'just', 'roll', 'out', 'CROW', 'already', 'well', 'way.And', 'odd', 'DVD', 'PAKCED', 'features', 'are', 'FOUR', 'count', 'four', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'here', 'Writer/Director', 'Production', 'Music/SFX', 'Actors', 'hit', 'marks', 'go', 'down', 'easily', 'seem', 'be', 'watching', 'totally', 'different', 'film', 'choices', 'made', 'five', 'treatments', 'several', 'drafts', 'script', 'changing', 'setting', 'going', 'bigger', 'better', 'cast', 'honestly', 'Tara', 'Reid', 'pretty', 'good', 'film', 'monster', 'tormented', 'soul', 'very', 'well', 'shame', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'even', 'darker', 'character', 'still', 'managed', 'come', 'up', 'nearly', 'exact', 'same', 'film', 'have', 'come', 'twists', 'turns', 'just', 'frustrating', 'hints', 'better', 'film', 'trying', 'break', 'out', 'time', 'kept', 'waiting', 'scorpions', 'are', 'spotlighted', 'several', 'times', 'film', 'become', 'part', 'story', 'were', 'just', 'coloring', 'something', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'see', 'desert', 'Lucas', 'commentaries', 'STAR', 'WARS', 'prequels', 'commentaires', 'here', 'go', 'long', 'way', 'here', 'explaining', 'ideas', 'intentions', 'making', 'film', 'adding', 'picture', 'rich', 'background', 'detail', 'leaving', 'wondering', 'why', 'almost', 'none', 'ended', 'up', 'screen.In', 'end', 'film', 'simply', 'carried', 'moments', 'not', 'surprises', 'story', 'new', 'setting', 'good', 'performances', 'few', 'deft', 'touches', 'direction', 'production', 'star', 'rippling', 'Crow', 'manifestation', 'was', 'welcome', 'dash', 'magic', 'little', 'else', 'separate', 'murder']",N/A

This is a straight-to-DVD sequel of a movie that was pretty good in terms of action and atmosphere but pretty thin in terms of plotting or character. None of the sequels ever really captured the lightning in a bottle again and they merely proved that attempting to copy the first movie just was a bad idea.This movie has a few things going for it. First, it isn't trying to be the first movie all over again. It's set in a border town and its got some great set pieces of its own. While it looks like the kind of cheap video shot movie that gets to DVD, there are some moments when the desert looks beautiful. Second, it has fun performances by Dennis Hopper, Danny Trejo and David Boreanaz. While they are all doing their scenery chewing acting that has served them so well, it's still a fun scenery chewing that rarely gets old.Of course, it's not perfect. There are some horrible bits of dialogue including the requisite scene where someone has to tell the story of the Crow (and it doesn't help that the woman telling the story is an Indian which means that it's not just a hokey story to drive a revenge plot - it's a Native American Hokey Legend that drives a revenge plot). The overall plot really makes no sense whatsoever but it has something to do with devil worship. I think. Edward Furlong seems like he's heavily medicated throughout the movie. While his initial scenes suggest a loser with a hidden past, once he's the Crow, he's about as intense and scary as Tinky Winky.Still, this isn't too painful to watch and you won't come away hating everyone involved. If you can buy it at a bargain price or borrow it from a friend, it's definitely worth it.",3,Worth a viewing,1372204800,"06 26, 2013",2013,1776,"['come', 'movie', 'high', 'expectations', 'are', 'probably', 'most', 'optimistic', 'horror', 'fan', 'ever', 'born', 'straight-to-DVD', 'sequel', 'movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'terms', 'action', 'atmosphere', 'pretty', 'thin', 'terms', 'plotting', 'character', 'None', 'sequels', 'ever', 'really', 'captured', 'lightning', 'bottle', 'again', 'merely', 'proved', 'attempting', 'copy', 'first', 'movie', 'just', 'was', 'bad', 'idea.This', 'movie', 'few', 'things', 'going', 'First', ""n't"", 'trying', 'be', 'first', 'movie', 'over', 'again', 'set', 'border', 'town', 'got', 'great', 'set', 'pieces', 'own', 'kind', 'cheap', 'video', 'shot', 'movie', 'DVD', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'desert', 'beautiful', 'Second', 'fun', 'performances', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'Danny', 'Trejo', 'David', 'Boreanaz', 'are', 'doing', 'scenery', 'chewing', 'acting', 'served', 'so', 'well', 'still', 'fun', 'scenery', 'chewing', 'rarely', 'old.Of', 'course', 'not', 'perfect', 'are', 'horrible', 'bits', 'dialogue', 'including', 'requisite', 'scene', 'where', 'someone', 'tell', 'story', 'Crow', ""n't"", 'help', 'woman', 'telling', 'story', 'Indian', 'not', 'just', 'hokey', 'story', 'drive', 'revenge', 'plot', 'Native', 'American', 'Hokey', 'Legend', 'revenge', 'plot', 'overall', 'plot', 'really', 'sense', 'whatsoever', 'something', 'do', 'devil', 'worship', 'think', 'Edward', 'Furlong', 'heavily', 'medicated', 'movie', 'initial', 'scenes', 'suggest', 'loser', 'hidden', 'past', 'once', 'Crow', 'about', 'intense', 'scary', 'Tinky', 'Winky.Still', ""n't"", 'too', 'painful', 'watch', 'wo', ""n't"", 'come', 'away', 'hating', 'everyone', 'involved', 'can', 'buy', 'bargain', 'price', 'borrow', 'friend', 'definitely', 'worth']",N/A
