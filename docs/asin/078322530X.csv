52056,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,078322530X,Acute Observer,"[0, 1]","This adventure film is based on the assumption that a state-of-the-art encrypted message could be read by an autistic nine year old! It is another film that is full of sound and fury. There is Alec Baldwin playing a reactionary Govt. agent who is out to kill this autistic child and his parents. Bruce Willis plays the bleeding-heart liberal out to save the world, one child at a time. Hollywood tells the truth.The film opens with a botched bank robbery in ""South Dakota"", of all places. Undercover agent Bruce pleads for more time so he can save two teen aged boys. This fails, and they are killed resisting arrest. (Could an agent really get this deeply involved?) [Does this allow latecomers to take seats and not miss anything?] Next comes the main plot. The autistic boy reads a puzzle magazine, and solves it in his head! This causes the murder of his parents, and the boy's narrow escape. The Chicago police are called, and Bruce gets his assignment: cover this case. He finds the hidden boy, takes him to a hospital. Now Bruce figures out that the boy is a target, and the rest of the story is how he tries to keep him alive until the happy ending.The assassination of a code clerk on a busy street reminds me of Hitchcock's ""Foreign Correspondent"" or similar replicated scenes. The tale of ""rogue agents out of control"" was disproved by the Watergate hearings. These agents are never ""out of control"" until they're caught. Andrew Jackson said that government was not a necessary evil, only its abuses were evil.

He plays Art Jeffries, an FBI agent who is in over his head at the  bureau after a difference in opinion with his superior over a bank heist.  Meanwhile, a small, autistic boy named Simon receives a puzzle book, and  while reading it, he discovers a secret government code called  &quot;Mercury,&quot; meant to keep officers in the American Embassies safe  from harm. He calls the number that he picks up from the puzzle, and the  head of the Mercury project, played by Alec Baldwin, sends one of his  henchmen to eliminate the problem. Soon, Simon is found in his bedroom  closet by Jeffries after the murder of his parents, leading into a  cat-and-mouse chase that spans the entirety of the film. The film contains  a high amount of suspense, and although a lot of the mystery aspects of the  film are in the norm for the genre, some of the plot contains originality.

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[0, 0]","MERCURY RISING (a/k/a MERCURY FALLING, 1998, 112 mins.) - Based on the novelSimple Simonby Ryne Douglas Pearson (which is very good, I read it when it came out and this is an excellent adaptation), MERCURY RISING centers on FBI Agent Art Jeffries (Willis), who ends up finding and protecting an 11-year-old autistic boy, Simon (a stunning Miko Hughes, who has continued acting but has since sunk into obscurity).Simon has cracked a multi-billion-dollar NSA code, which was leaked into a children's puzzle book just to see if it could be done - and by whom. Soon a single wet team (one assassin) is sent to murder Simon's parents, and the action begins. It's a massive chase scene, with the NSA murdering its own in their murderous pursuit of Simon, and the FBI at its wits' end trying to help.Though I was disappointed this film portrayed Simon as 11 instead of the original 16 years old, everyone was super-impressive in this, including the smarmy, hammy Alec Baldwin as the NSA thug-director. This film marks the actual beginning of attempts to teach movie audiences about autistic kids. It must have been a complete laugh for Willis.By the time he did this, he had under his belt the first three ""Die Hard"" films, ""Twelve Monkeys"", ""Last Man Standing"", ""The Fifth Element"" and ""The Jackal"". Miko Hughes did some intense studying for such a small boy in order to portray autism perfectly. I can't really tell why he's vanished into a sad obscurity, since he's still acting.This was way before autism-related films had become as common as they are today - ""Rain Man"" notwithstanding - and is the only film portraying an autistic child in a major starring role. Still, it is mid-career vintage Bruce Willis at his best and the special effects are splendid. Some hair-raising moments await you, and the heartbreaking performance by Miko is something not to be missed.One final point. Allegedly, the novel was inspired by an actual event: during the Cold War (1955), Sears Roebuck published a telephone number that was supposed to be a hotline to Santa Claus for kids to call. With the placement of one wrong digit, the very first kids found themselves calling into CONAD (the original abbreviation of NORAD).The colonel who answered the line simply screamed at those first few unfortunate kids. Later, NORAD set up a special non-classified line and gladly took calls, updating the kids on Santa's progress! - at least, this is the story I have heard. I myself never called that number, but it did kick off that decades-long tradition of NORAD and all weather stations ""tracking"" Santa's progress on Christmas Eve.",4,Simon is home,1318896000,"10 18, 2011",2011,2612,"['MERCURY', 'RISING', 'a/k/a', 'MERCURY', 'FALLING', '1998', '112', 'mins', 'Based', 'novelSimple', 'Simonby', 'Ryne', 'Douglas', 'Pearson', 'very', 'good', 'read', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'excellent', 'adaptation', 'MERCURY', 'RISING', 'centers', 'FBI', 'Agent', 'Art', 'Jeffries', 'Willis', 'who', 'up', 'finding', 'protecting', '11-year-old', 'autistic', 'boy', 'Simon', 'stunning', 'Miko', 'Hughes', 'who', 'continued', 'acting', 'sunk', 'obscurity', '.Simon', 'cracked', 'multi-billion-dollar', 'NSA', 'code', 'was', 'leaked', 'children', 'puzzle', 'book', 'just', 'see', 'could', 'be', 'done', 'whom', 'Soon', 'single', 'wet', 'team', 'one', 'assassin', 'sent', 'murder', 'Simon', 'parents', 'action', 'massive', 'chase', 'scene', 'NSA', 'murdering', 'own', 'murderous', 'pursuit', 'Simon', 'FBI', 'wits', 'end', 'trying', 'help.Though', 'was', 'disappointed', 'film', 'portrayed', 'Simon', '11', 'instead', 'original', '16', 'years', 'old', 'everyone', 'was', 'super-impressive', 'including', 'smarmy', 'hammy', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'NSA', 'thug-director', 'film', 'actual', 'beginning', 'attempts', 'teach', 'movie', 'audiences', 'autistic', 'kids', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'complete', 'laugh', 'Willis.By', 'time', 'did', 'had', 'belt', 'first', 'three', 'Die', 'Hard', 'films', 'Twelve', 'Monkeys', 'Last', 'Man', 'Standing', 'Fifth', 'Element', 'Jackal', 'Miko', 'Hughes', 'did', 'intense', 'studying', 'small', 'boy', 'order', 'portray', 'autism', 'perfectly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'tell', 'why', 'vanished', 'sad', 'obscurity', 'still', 'acting.This', 'was', 'way', 'autism-related', 'films', 'had', 'become', 'as', 'common', 'are', 'today', 'Rain', 'Man', 'notwithstanding', 'only', 'film', 'portraying', 'autistic', 'child', 'major', 'starring', 'role', 'Still', 'mid-career', 'vintage', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'best', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'splendid', 'hair-raising', 'moments', 'heartbreaking', 'performance', 'Miko', 'something', 'not', 'be', 'missed.One', 'final', 'point', 'Allegedly', 'novel', 'was', 'inspired', 'actual', 'event', 'Cold', 'War', '1955', 'Sears', 'Roebuck', 'published', 'telephone', 'number', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'hotline', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'kids', 'call', 'placement', 'one', 'wrong', 'digit', 'very', 'first', 'kids', 'found', 'calling', 'CONAD', 'original', 'abbreviation', 'NORAD', '.The', 'colonel', 'who', 'answered', 'line', 'simply', 'screamed', 'first', 'few', 'unfortunate', 'kids', 'Later', 'NORAD', 'set', 'up', 'special', 'non-classified', 'line', 'gladly', 'took', 'calls', 'updating', 'kids', 'Santa', 'progress', 'least', 'story', 'have', 'heard', 'never', 'called', 'number', 'did', 'kick', 'off', 'decades-long', 'tradition', 'NORAD', 'weather', 'stations', 'tracking', 'Santa', 'progress', 'Christmas', 'Eve']",N/A

It can all be summed up to a harmless action 'flick' , that offers the viewer a couple of hours with the old Willis' McLain we all know all to well from the 'Diehard' trilogy . In addition to that , you find a kind of routine man plus kid getaway from the bad guys thriller , which is enriched with a secondary interesting (though superficial) dramatization of the autism's syndrome .The matching of Willis with the child works quite well . My hunch is that this role had turned Night Shyamalan's attention to Willis , this attention ended up in a collaboration that was concluded in Willis' biggest blockbuster to date . This point of view makes the film more interesting , because you get a chance to watch Willis making his first steps in an uncharted territory for him . Eventually this journey brought him also the role in 'Disney's the kid' and of course in 'Unbreakable' , so it's pretty nice to see another brick in his developing career .Aside from that , the movie is vastly flawed and has lots of holes in the script and plot . I recommend a good and through review of a Canadian writer , that wrote one of the first reviews about this movie and really pointed out  all the defects this product has , in a funny and humorous manner . Nevertheless , for an entertaining movie that doesn't take itself too seriously these are bearable defects you can live with .

Bruce Willis is an FBI agent on the outs because he didn't approve of the agency's handling of a hostage situation where some young men got killed. Now they have him doing scrub work but bring him in on a nearby 'murder/suicide' case where the couple's child might be missing. Said child is autistic and when it's realized the kid seems to have cracked a high-level NSA encryption, Bruce must protect the child from elimination.This is a clever idea for a script but the script itself is pretty awful. With a high concept like this the viewer needs to suspend their disbelief. Not happening here. There were so many things that were so unbelievable it kept me from enjoying it. The directing, performances and pretty much everything else were fine. It's just stupid. For instance: Willis must, by all means, protect the young. But, when he decides to go off his meds, he dumps them out his car window while driving so any young kid can come by, scoop them up and ingest them. And there's the super high-level hitman who doesn't know to flee the scene after a hit. Dumb stuff like that happens throughout.The action is good.

It's a good high-action, well-produced movie and interesting to watch, if you don't let credibility problems get into the way. Willis plays a discredited FBI agent assigned to lesser tasks and stumbles upon a situation where an autistic nine-year-old boy (Miko Hughs) has inadvertently deciphered a super-secret international code putting all U, S. and ally agents at risk for their lives. Well, it seems the CIA Agent in  charge has a solution to eliminate the boy and all others who might know of the breach in security. Let's face it, this is really a jerky plot, but Alec Baldwin, the agent, strives to carry out his gruesome and ruthless task and Willis becomes the protector and defender of the boy after his father and mother are executed. Well, it isn't easy. Eventually the renegade agent is corralled and the boy  finds new foster parents. In between, there's a lot of fighting, gunfire explosions, car chases and even a tiny bit of romance. It's an engaging story, but don't attempt to think about it too deeply.The movie is well produced. Willis is good in his role. Any acting awards ought to  go to Miko Hughs, the little boy. The pace of the movie is good, the action is brisk.. It's an entertaining movie in spite of the credibility problems.

52076,A7Y6AVS576M03,078322530X,gobirds2,"[1, 2]",This is an action film with a lot of emotion behind it. It has a real heart felt story that questions plausibility and true credibility at times but it really hits home as it evokes genuine sentiment and feeling through a brutal world we now live in. This to date is the last great action film staring Bruce Willis. His performance of the dedicated civil servant doing what is right against all odds is admirable. His adversary Alec Baldwin stands for all that is wrong with a system that is supposed to protect our way of life and liberties while sacrificing the innocent trying to protect it at the enrichment of his own ego. At the center is a small autistic boy who supposedly can compromise Baldwin's plans who is being protected by FBI agent Willis who has fallen from grace. In simplest terms it is a film of right and goodness against greed and evil. On that level this film works. This film contains one of John Barry's last great scores as it gives credence to the story by bringing our most tearfully compassionate emotions to the surface while driving the narrative with an impassioned purpose.

It includes many fine action scenes and the entire story from beginning to end is always fast-moving and in your face.The film starts out with Art (Bruce) as an undercover FBI agent inside a bank trying to negotiate with the criminals. He was close to getting the entire bank free of harms way, but when the place is stormed and there is bloodshed Art totally loses his cool and clocks the guy in charge. So much for diplomacy.After being demoted, Art is put in charge of investigating the mysterious disappearance of Simon Lynch (played the Miko Hughes, the smartass from ""Full House."") Simon is a child with severe emotional problems who is incapable of articulating himself in a coherent way, yet he was able to crack the government's top-secret ""mercury"" national security code. Go figure.One of my favorite parts has gotta be when Art shows up at Kudrow's (Alec Baldwin) birthday party, unexpectedly. That's what I loved the most about the character that Bruce plays. He did what we all wanted to do and he never blinked once. He just had so much nerve and gall and only had 1 mission on his mind. I thought it was hysterical when Alec Baldwin told him ""please don't touch the wine bottles"" and it was even funnier when he'd open them up and swig a sip, saying ""you don't care about a 9 year-old boy but you care about your f'n wine bottles.""I enjoyed this movie very much because it's not just a typical Bruce Willis movie. It's somewhat sad, yet it's also uplifting and in this movie we get to see another facet of Bruce, his softer and sensitive side which rarely comes out in any of his other projects. He played the role perfectly because like a ship he was both steady and strong and rough.The plot ties up with Bruce's signature action-filled, theatrical 3-ring circus. If you enjoyed any of the ""Die Hard"" movies or even ""16 Blocks"" you will most assuredly like the pace and the excitement of ""Mercury Rising.""",5,you can't keep a good man down,1265328000,"02 5, 2010",2010,2061,"['many', 'classic', 'movies', 'Mercury', 'Rising', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'man', 'mission', 'save', 'innocent', 'person', 'ruthless', 'killers', 'many', 'fine', 'action', 'scenes', 'entire', 'story', 'beginning', 'end', 'always', 'fast-moving', 'face.The', 'film', 'out', 'Art', 'Bruce', 'undercover', 'FBI', 'agent', 'bank', 'trying', 'negotiate', 'criminals', 'was', 'close', 'getting', 'entire', 'bank', 'free', 'harms', 'way', 'when', 'place', 'stormed', 'bloodshed', 'Art', 'totally', 'cool', 'guy', 'charge', 'So', 'much', 'diplomacy.After', 'being', 'demoted', 'Art', 'put', 'charge', 'investigating', 'mysterious', 'disappearance', 'Simon', 'Lynch', 'played', 'Miko', 'Hughes', 'smartass', 'Full', 'House', 'Simon', 'child', 'severe', 'emotional', 'problems', 'who', 'incapable', 'articulating', 'coherent', 'way', 'yet', 'was', 'able', 'crack', 'government', 'top-secret', 'mercury', 'national', 'security', 'code', 'Go', 'figure.One', 'favorite', 'parts', 'got', 'ta', 'be', 'when', 'Art', 'up', 'Kudrow', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'birthday', 'party', 'unexpectedly', 'what', 'loved', 'most', 'character', 'Bruce', 'did', 'what', 'wanted', 'do', 'never', 'blinked', 'once', 'just', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'nerve', 'gall', 'only', 'had', '1', 'mission', 'mind', 'thought', 'was', 'hysterical', 'when', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'told', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'touch', 'wine', 'bottles', 'was', 'even', 'funnier', 'when', ""'d"", 'open', 'up', 'swig', 'sip', 'saying', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', '9', 'year-old', 'boy', 'care', 'f', 'n', 'wine', 'bottles', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'not', 'just', 'typical', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'sad', 'also', 'uplifting', 'movie', 'get', 'see', 'facet', 'Bruce', 'softer', 'sensitive', 'side', 'rarely', 'out', 'other', 'projects', 'played', 'role', 'perfectly', 'ship', 'was', 'steady', 'strong', 'rough.The', 'plot', 'ties', 'up', 'Bruce', 'signature', 'action-filled', 'theatrical', '3-ring', 'circus', 'enjoyed', 'Die', 'Hard', 'movies', 'even', '16', 'Blocks', 'will', 'most', 'assuredly', 'pace', 'excitement', 'Mercury', 'Rising']",N/A

Exhibit A would have to be a better film.The premise concerns an autistic child who is able to sightread extremely high-order classified ciphers. He's accomplished exactly that with the National Security Agency's latest version, which he's accessed through one of the lamest plot twists imaginable. (They've placed it in a puzzle magazine to beta-test it--no, I'm not making this up.)So great -- the NSA hires the kid and turns him loose on Chinese, French, and other unfriendly ciphers, right? No they do not. Wake up -- this is Hollywood. They send goons out to kill him, which is where Bruce Willis, playing a conflicted law-enforcement officer of uncertain antecendents, comes to the rescue. From there on it's the standard huggermugger--unnecessary hairbreadth escapes, elite assassins who turn dopey at the most convenient moment, all-but-omniscient villains who can't see the obvious trap at the climax, etc.The acting was phoned in. Willis can do many things well, but he can't do conflicted. For some peculiar reason, the guy who fed Buscemi into the wood chipper in &quot;Fargo&quot; has his hair dyed black in this one. All traces of quirkiness evident in his performance for the Coens has vanished here.The sole exception to the overall blandness is provided by the Bloviator himself, Alec Baldwin. Perhaps the film's major offense is the implication that whole scheme is being carried out in support of Iraqi agents working against Saddam. (Kind of getting a jump on Fatboy Moore here.)

He was down on his luck, his rent was three months overdue, and his wife was getting seriously pissed off.The plot of his script was simple. It was about an autistic boy named Simon who can read the secret codes embedded in crossword puzzles. In other words, he took a common urban myth and wrote a script about it. Not original, but certainly compelling. Add Bruce Willis to the mix and you have a big budget movie.Then one day, his agent called. He was nervous. A major studio was offering a six figure number for the movie. When other movie studios heard about it, a war of escalation ensued. Soon, they were trying to outbid each other. The price kept climbing and climbing and climbing.Finally, the agent had enough. The script was sold. Presumably, the scriptwriter got to stay married and pay off his rent. And, I hope, socked the money away into savings. Because this movie sucks.The movie went through several title changes, a sure sign that there's a problem. It was originally supposed to be Simon Says, but the execs changed it because nobody knew what that meant. So they changed it to Mercury Rising instead. As Dr. Evil would say, &quot;Riiiight.&quot;There's a few problems. One of them is translating onto screen the depiction of code. Apparently, the movie decides code decryption sounds like a high-pitched whining sound. Perhaps it's an accurate parallel, but it's not fun to listen to.Simon's autism is depicted a little too accurately. His parents are killed early on, so Simon's on his own and fairly incapable of doing much besides wailing his head off when touched. This is very accurate. This does not make for a pleasant movie.Willis' character is the usual -- haggard, determined, violent. He isn't much more than that. He gets tangled up in the plot (FBI vs. &quot;Government Bad Guys&quot;) and calls in favors.The bad guys show a distinct lack of common sense. It's so blithly nonsensical that it's not even worth the energy to describe the inconsistencies. Suffice it to say, the bad guys show a boogeyman-like ability to pop up anywhere when convenient, and a surprising inability to do it when it might impair the protagonist.What bugged me most is that ultimately, this movie could have been about ANYBODY who happened to know Something Secret (TM). It wasn't about the boy's ability to crack code, it was about Bruce Willis' character protecting an innocent. Like in Eraser. Like in Enemy of the State. Like in a dozen other movies. Only in Enemy of the State, the main character's skills actually were USEFUL in the plot. Simon never gets to exercise his code-cracking abilities more than once (to meet one of the soon-to-be-dead informants).Even in portraying an autistic person, Rain Man and Cube still managed to make the character worth liking instead of utterly pathetic.The other problem is that the villain's execuse is -- *GASP! -- being a patriot to protect undercover agents in Iraq. Well, that dates the movie just a little bit. Not their fault, necessarily, but certainly the movie loses its sting. In addition, the whole concept of &quot;sacrificing one for the good of all&quot; is a little more strict these days. Ask an American if an autistic boy's life should be spared to save thousands of agents attempting to stop terrorism and more than half will doom the boy.I can understand why the studio execs bid on the idea. It was a great concept but utterly defanged of any real meaning, failing to utilize its characters, its high-minded ideals, or even its action scenes in a way that makes us care about anybody in the movie.

52101,A11TUHEHHENLBC,078322530X,"Patrick L. Boyle ""Mr. Wonderful""","[1, 2]","Alec Baldwin is of course a perfectly terrible human being. As has been revealed conclusively by his off screen antics with his daughter, he is a very sour and nasty person. He is however quite entertaining playing a cartoon conservative. He is a comitted liberal - to put it politely. More candidly and more justly, he can be described as a lefty whacko. His dark heart is filled with hate for conservatives - which to him seems to include everyone who doesn't share his taste for tyranny.In this actioner Baldwin gets to again portray the man you love to hate. Baldwin has played this character before, most famously as the sales force motivator in ""Glengary, Glenross"". He also was the wonderfully despicable surgeon in ""Malice"". His technique is to play the character as if he were one of the hated Republicans of his imaginings. He's very good at it. He mouths some preposterous drivel that he thinks characterizes a conservative policy position in his reptilian manner and everyone immediately hates him. He's like Tina Fey and Sarah Palin. He pretends to be a conservative so as to mock and disparage them.In this thriller, Baldwin spouts a lot of patriotic blather as he orders his hired killer to assassinate a nice innocent couple and their handicapped young son. This is certainly painting with a broad brush. Balwin is anything but subtle. He is evil incarnate.He plays a cartoon conservative. He probably thinks like Richard Dreyfuss - another lefty who likes to portray conservatives in a bad light - that he is channeling Dick Cheny. The joke is, he's channeling himself. He doesn't have to act.Baldwin is the reason to see this movie. He's discusting and vicious in real life but that helps him on screen playing agenda driven leftist propaganda characters.There is a problem with Bruce Willis and Chi McBride. In traditional story lines the hero has a sidekick. Classically Gabby Hayes or Walter Brennan played the little guy who tagged after big, dominant John Wayne or Clint Eastwood. But here McBride as the earnest but bumbling sidekick is twice Willis' size. It's not that McBride is so big - although in this film he looks like Godzilla in black face - but that Willis is so small. McBride is 6'4"" but so was John Waybe and Clint Eastwood. I'm 6'4"" myself as are million of others.The problem is that Bruce Willis became an action hero by accident. He played a young, cute wise cracking foil to a beautiful woman in the TV comedy ""Moonlighting"". But then they cast him in ""Die Hard"" against type. The point of the movie plot was that this innocuous looking guy is really a NY street cop and and when need be - an army of one. In Die Hard in the first three scenes everyone is surprised that he is a cop. The fellow passenger, the chauffer, and the party guests all assume that this unassuming guy is just another corporate flunky - maybe an accountant.This drammatic set up wouldn't work if he were played by Clint Eastwood - everyone would immediately assume he was a cop and everyone would expect him to kick the bad guy's butts - without delay. Reginal Vel Johnson plays a similar character. He is set up as a little chubby black cop who is afraid of his own gun. Naturally he too kicks butt in the film's finale. That's the story arc.But Die hard was such a good and profitable movie that it ended up type casting Willis as an action hero - a role for which he was and remains improbable. He's too small, not particularly muscular and not athletic. He is however a very fine actor with a big range and he can be very sympatetic on the big screen. But in this movie little soft Bruce is sattled with a side kick who makes him appear to be a drawf. Willis might have remained a light comedian if not for Die Hard. He could have been the new Jack Lemmon.",3,Alec Baldwin as Snidely Whiplash,1308009600,"06 14, 2011",2011,3778,"['Alec', 'Baldwin', 'course', 'perfectly', 'terrible', 'human', 'being', 'been', 'revealed', 'conclusively', 'off', 'screen', 'antics', 'daughter', 'very', 'sour', 'nasty', 'person', 'however', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'playing', 'cartoon', 'conservative', 'comitted', 'liberal', 'put', 'politely', 'More', 'candidly', 'more', 'justly', 'can', 'be', 'described', 'lefty', 'whacko', 'dark', 'heart', 'filled', 'hate', 'conservatives', 'include', 'everyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'share', 'taste', 'tyranny.In', 'actioner', 'Baldwin', 'again', 'portray', 'man', 'love', 'hate', 'Baldwin', 'played', 'character', 'most', 'famously', 'sales', 'force', 'motivator', 'Glengary', 'Glenross', 'also', 'was', 'wonderfully', 'despicable', 'surgeon', 'Malice', 'technique', 'play', 'character', 'were', 'one', 'hated', 'Republicans', 'imaginings', 'very', 'good', 'mouths', 'preposterous', 'drivel', 'conservative', 'policy', 'position', 'reptilian', 'manner', 'everyone', 'immediately', 'Tina', 'Fey', 'Sarah', 'Palin', 'be', 'conservative', 'so', 'mock', 'disparage', 'them.In', 'thriller', 'Baldwin', 'lot', 'patriotic', 'blather', 'orders', 'hired', 'killer', 'assassinate', 'nice', 'innocent', 'couple', 'handicapped', 'young', 'son', 'certainly', 'painting', 'broad', 'brush', 'Balwin', 'anything', 'subtle', 'evil', 'incarnate.He', 'cartoon', 'conservative', 'probably', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'lefty', 'who', 'portray', 'conservatives', 'bad', 'light', 'channeling', 'Dick', 'Cheny', 'joke', 'channeling', ""n't"", 'have', 'act.Baldwin', 'reason', 'see', 'movie', 'discusting', 'vicious', 'real', 'life', 'screen', 'playing', 'agenda', 'driven', 'leftist', 'propaganda', 'problem', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Chi', 'McBride', 'traditional', 'story', 'lines', 'hero', 'sidekick', 'Classically', 'Gabby', 'Hayes', 'Walter', 'Brennan', 'played', 'little', 'guy', 'who', 'tagged', 'big', 'dominant', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'here', 'McBride', 'earnest', 'bumbling', 'sidekick', 'twice', 'Willis', 'size', 'not', 'McBride', 'so', 'big', 'film', 'Godzilla', 'black', 'face', 'Willis', 'so', 'small', 'McBride', '6', '4', 'so', 'was', 'John', 'Waybe', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', ""'m"", '6', '4', 'are', 'million', 'others.The', 'problem', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'became', 'action', 'hero', 'accident', 'played', 'young', 'cute', 'wise', 'cracking', 'foil', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'TV', 'comedy', 'Moonlighting', 'then', 'cast', 'Die', 'Hard', 'type', 'point', 'movie', 'plot', 'was', 'innocuous', 'looking', 'guy', 'really', 'NY', 'street', 'cop', 'when', 'need', 'be', 'army', 'one', 'Die', 'Hard', 'first', 'three', 'scenes', 'everyone', 'surprised', 'cop', 'fellow', 'passenger', 'chauffer', 'party', 'assume', 'unassuming', 'guy', 'just', 'corporate', 'flunky', 'maybe', 'accountant.This', 'drammatic', 'set', 'up', 'would', ""n't"", 'work', 'were', 'played', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'everyone', 'would', 'immediately', 'assume', 'was', 'cop', 'everyone', 'would', 'expect', 'kick', 'bad', 'guy', 'butts', 'delay', 'Reginal', 'Vel', 'Johnson', 'similar', 'character', 'set', 'up', 'little', 'chubby', 'black', 'cop', 'who', 'afraid', 'own', 'gun', 'Naturally', 'too', 'butt', 'film', 'finale', 'story', 'arc.But', 'Die', 'hard', 'was', 'such', 'good', 'profitable', 'movie', 'ended', 'up', 'type', 'casting', 'Willis', 'action', 'hero', 'role', 'was', 'improbable', 'too', 'small', 'not', 'particularly', 'muscular', 'not', 'athletic', 'however', 'very', 'fine', 'actor', 'big', 'range', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'sympatetic', 'big', 'screen', 'movie', 'little', 'soft', 'Bruce', 'sattled', 'side', 'kick', 'who', 'appear', 'be', 'drawf', 'Willis', 'might', 'have', 'remained', 'light', 'comedian', 'not', 'Die', 'Hard', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'new', 'Jack', 'Lemmon']",N/A

Bruce never fails at being himself a great action hero character and here Bruce does not disappoint.  The problem with this movie is the movie itself.  It is so untruthful as to be lame.  I have autism.  I am diagnosed with high functioning autism now but that was not always the case.  In my childhood I was more towards the catatonic side of the autism spectrum.The kid was so one demensional and flat.  While some autistic people can see patterns really well the little things the quirky natures and odd mannerisms absent or were wrong.  Being autistic is like living in a seperate world all your own while simulteanously trying to understand and survive in this world.  When you are autistic there is always a tug of war between the two opposing worlds that manifests itself somehow in the persons ""acting out"".  Especially at the extreme youth of the so called autistic child it is hard to beleive he was that in control of his senses and responses to humans.  When I was eight years old as a high functioning autistic I have no where near that level of self control in changing stimulus soak environments full of people.It is a ok movie get it if you want.  I guess its why real police officers never watch most cop drama's because they see live and experence police work real life and what they see on film seldom matches their reality.  Likewise Murcury rising is a great film to awaken neurotypicals to the existance of autistic people but please know it is stereotypical, superficial and trite in its handling of autism.  There is both more vigor and hope in life on the the autistm spectrum than this movie reveals.  This Murcury Rising despite its major flaws is an excellent first step on your journey to understand autism because it shows you care.  Rain Man is a better movie dispite some of its relatively minor flaws.I saw the movie Murcury Rising and it was so bad I did not want it in my collection because to me it just did not feel real or meaningful to me in any way.

FBI agent Art Jeffries (Bruce Willis) is washed out after confronting his superiors after an undercover job goes bad, while Simon Lynch (Miko Hughes) is an autistic child who loves puzzles. When he cracks a code that the Government put into a magazine to test it's strength he becomes a target and his parents are murdered by someone from the NSA.

Willis looks like he is on autopilot - and Willis on autopilot is not a good thing. He mumbles his way through it and doesn't really convince aside from when being an action hero.

Ginter is menacing but not given enough time, Dickens is simply thrown into the film without thought and Peter Stormare makes a fleeting appearance.

Die Hard? I just felt as though I was watching a movie that I'd seen before, and that we the first time I saw it. Brucie is getting a bit long in the tooth for all this too.
