1158474,AVJZQ6YNFUK92,B00181RD4G,Grindhouse and Horror,"[4, 4]","In the beginning, a woman's boyfriend is killed by a werewolf when they're both out camping. She kills the creature, but is also bitten. Accused of his murder, she's put in a women's prison. She's visited by the ghost of her boyfriend (this part is similar to AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON) who warns her that she'll become a werewolf. Obviously, she becomes the creature during a full moon and begins tearing people apart in extreme gore sequences; this is made mainly for nudity and gore. This film also has one thought in mind, and that's to put as much entertainment in its running time as possible.  The pace (with the exception of maybe some small parts earlier on) is really fast, and I thought that the film never got boring; and the women are good looking also.  The film is low-budget, but the gore effects are really well done considering its budget and most of them are very extreme.  There's tons of gore and the werewolf looks great for a low budget film, and there's also a lot of nudity; the beginning portions of the film are mostly nudity, and the extreme gore kicks in a little bit later. There's a sequence when Eva Derrick is standing in the nude, but it's difficult to see any full frontal in this scene. Another sequence has Victoria De Mare being fully nude on a table around the beginning, but you can't see any full frontal nudity in this part either. There's plenty of other nude scenes in the film, but none of these contain full nudity; this may disappoint some people.  It's a campy and extreme exploitation film; elements of comedy are present. Despite the extreme gore and high body count, the tone of movie isn't dark or depressing; I wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for a dark toned horror flick. This flick is extremely easy to follow; it's one of those films that you can just turn off you're brain and watch because you don't have to pay attention to it.  If you just want to be entertained I would highly recommend it. However, there are some things about the film that may be a problem with some people. The movie lacks atmosphere, suspense, and most of the scenery is bland; a lot of this film takes place indoors, so the lack of effective atmosphere and dull scenery may be a problem with some people. This is a low-budget flick, so the women's prison isn't that well designed and looks cheap and bland. As for the directing, I personally thought it was OK. I really had fun with the movie, but it isn't a film that's meant to be analyzed. It's too bad that this flick isn't more well known.  As of this particular time, there's only one seller I'm aware of that is offering it.  It should be available everywhere to buy.I can't find a review that specifically states what they shot this movie with. My guess would be a good mini DV camcorder. As for the DVD, it's in widescreen but it isn't anamorphic; but the picture quality is clear, and it looks nice.  The commentary is pretty good, and it has other extras like outtakes and a photo gallery.",5,Simply a fun film,1323302400,"12 8, 2011",2011,2994,"['beginning', 'woman', 'boyfriend', 'killed', 'werewolf', 'when', ""'re"", 'out', 'camping', 'creature', 'also', 'bitten', 'Accused', 'murder', 'put', 'women', 'prison', 'visited', 'ghost', 'boyfriend', 'part', 'similar', 'AMERICAN', 'WEREWOLF', 'IN', 'LONDON', 'who', ""'ll"", 'become', 'werewolf', 'Obviously', 'creature', 'full', 'moon', 'tearing', 'people', 'apart', 'extreme', 'gore', 'sequences', 'made', 'mainly', 'nudity', 'gore', 'film', 'also', 'one', 'thought', 'mind', 'put', 'as', 'much', 'entertainment', 'running', 'time', 'possible', 'pace', 'exception', 'maybe', 'small', 'parts', 'earlier', 'really', 'fast', 'thought', 'film', 'never', 'got', 'boring', 'women', 'are', 'good', 'looking', 'also', 'film', 'low-budget', 'gore', 'effects', 'are', 'really', 'well', 'done', 'considering', 'budget', 'most', 'are', 'very', 'extreme', 'tons', 'gore', 'werewolf', 'great', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'also', 'lot', 'nudity', 'beginning', 'portions', 'film', 'are', 'mostly', 'nudity', 'extreme', 'gore', 'kicks', 'little', 'bit', 'later', 'sequence', 'when', 'Eva', 'Derrick', 'standing', 'nude', 'difficult', 'see', 'full', 'frontal', 'scene', 'sequence', 'Victoria', 'De', 'Mare', 'being', 'fully', 'nude', 'table', 'beginning', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'full', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'part', 'plenty', 'other', 'nude', 'scenes', 'film', 'none', 'contain', 'full', 'nudity', 'may', 'disappoint', 'people', 'campy', 'extreme', 'exploitation', 'film', 'elements', 'comedy', 'are', 'present', 'extreme', 'gore', 'high', 'body', 'count', 'tone', 'movie', ""n't"", 'dark', 'depressing', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', ""'re"", 'looking', 'dark', 'toned', 'horror', 'flick', 'flick', 'extremely', 'easy', 'follow', 'one', 'films', 'can', 'just', 'turn', 'off', ""'re"", 'brain', 'watch', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'pay', 'attention', 'just', 'want', 'be', 'entertained', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'However', 'are', 'things', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'problem', 'people', 'movie', 'atmosphere', 'suspense', 'most', 'scenery', 'bland', 'lot', 'film', 'place', 'indoors', 'lack', 'effective', 'atmosphere', 'dull', 'scenery', 'may', 'be', 'problem', 'people', 'low-budget', 'flick', 'women', 'prison', ""n't"", 'that', 'well', 'designed', 'cheap', 'bland', 'directing', 'personally', 'thought', 'was', 'OK', 'really', 'had', 'fun', 'movie', ""n't"", 'film', 'meant', 'be', 'analyzed', 'too', 'bad', 'flick', ""n't"", 'more', 'well', 'known', 'particular', 'time', 'only', 'one', 'seller', ""'m"", 'aware', 'offering', 'should', 'be', 'available', 'everywhere', 'buy.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'review', 'specifically', 'what', 'shot', 'movie', 'guess', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'mini', 'DV', 'camcorder', 'DVD', 'widescreen', ""n't"", 'anamorphic', 'picture', 'quality', 'clear', 'nice', 'commentary', 'pretty', 'good', 'other', 'extras', 'outtakes', 'photo', 'gallery']",A Werewolf in a Women's Prison

1158477,AGSBVCZ1L0XYO,B00181RD4G,Timothy Collins,"[6, 8]","A great movie combining 2 genres that have never been combined before. Werewolves and prison movies. Normally when you have a women in prison film it's a non-stop beat up the girl movie, but now you add the fact that the victim can transfor into a homicidal super powered wolf and the odds on the sadistic prison guards is not so good. A great film with great effects. Plenty of gore for all of the gorehounds but it also has a great story attached to it. It has parts that are an homage to ""An American Werewolf in London"" but is not ripping it off.
