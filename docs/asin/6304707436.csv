During his lifetime, Williams James criticized his younger brother's novels for, in so many words, containing too much tedious detail that only stood in the way of the plot.  I could not agree more,  However, what Director Jane Campion has done with this story is anything but tedious.  She begins with rich settings and unusual camera angles then brings the characters to life with a very convincing all-star cast.  Nicole Kidman does a fabulous portrayal of Isabel Archer, the independent-minded and impetuous young American heiress who is so intent on remaining single - if only to avoid marriage to a 'proper man of means' because it is what's 'expected' of her - that she finds herself running from the one man who, out of genuine love and concern, pursues her across an ocean while she allows herself to be swept away by the cold and cunning Gilbert Osmond, most excellently portrayed by John Malkovich.

434028,A1L43KWWR05PCS,6304707436,Lawyeraau,"[0, 1]","Jane Campion is a brilliant director who can direct a film and convey much with a minimum of language and action. Her film, &quot;The Piano&quot; is a testament to that innate talent. This would lead one to believe that directing an adaptation of a Henry James novel would be a natural segue for her.While this is a lush and beautiful period piece, the problem with it is that it is somewhat dull. Despite stellar performances by Barbara Hershey and the supporting cast, the main star, Nicole Kidman, is out of her league, though she is a luminous beauty and has some acting ability. The problem is that her performance lacks the presence or depth necessary to transcend the material and make this a truly interesting film. She just is not good enough an actress to be able to carry this type of storyline and engage the viewer in the lead role of wealthy expatriate, Isabel Archer.Moreover, while John Malkovich gives a wonderful performance as the malevolent Gilbert Osmond, he is decidedly miscast as he is simply not charismatic enough to make it believable that Isabel Archer would throw caution to the wind over such an unattractive and, decidedly, sinister man. It is unfortunate, as the film is an otherwise fairly faithful adaptation of Henry James' complex novel of the same name.

Malkovitch is simply the wrong type of actor - Gilbert is, as he says ""convention itself.""  Yet the actor, as usual, looks like an unmade bed - he also wear his ""watch out I'm a psychopath"" visage used in such ""chewing the scenery"" performances as he gave in ""Con Air"" and ""In The Line of Fire"".  Gilbert is the Adrian Brody type - suave, elegant, vain.  Gilbert would never lower himself to hit Isabel - his tactics are more subtle and are untranslatable into a film.  James' works are not cinematic - he plumbs the depths of his characters - the action occurs in the character's consciousness.  The greatest chapter in the novel has Isabel ruminating about her marriage in front of a fireplace.  Also, I'm not at all certain why Campion, a one trick pony if there ever was one, decided to give Kidman a fright wig - it is certainly not in the style a 19th century woman would wear.  If you haven't read the book you may enjoy the film - though I cannot see how you would.  If you have read the book you could not enjoy the film.

He had a gift not only for writing about displacement but also for writing complicated women - women who strive for a better place, a better solution and a better role to fill than the limited one afforded to them by society. Isabel Archer is one of his greatest creations and I thought she was wonderfully played by Nicole Kidman. This is a difficult role and it could not have been easy for her to take it on as Isabel runs the gamut of emotions from start to finish.  She inhabits the role of Isabel - of being that woman who longs for something more, something elusive, something different.  Her co-stars provide her with the very thing she longed for, to the ultimate sad outcome.Martin Donovan and Barbara Hershey deserve extra accolades for the believability they lent to their characterizations of Ralph Touchett and Serena Merle.  Ralph is the unacknowledged heart of the story until his sad demise and Isabel's realization of his unintended contribution to her now sad life. Merle, the consummate American sophisticate and expatriate, is peeled apart layer by layer on screen.  She manages expertly to be a mosaic of a person - a different character with every person she encounters - but she is ultimately trapped by the choices she has made.  In some ways, she is more tragic than Isabel and in other ways, she is more devious than Gilbert. The hardest roles to fill onscreen are those of the selfless (Ralph) and the complex (Merle).  Martin and Barbara were perfectly cast.The direction by Jane Campion was a bit frazzled as she inserted certain dream sequences which I found unnecessary and bizarre.  The Isabel of Henry Jame's creation may have been headstrong, but she was never dreamy or prone to such flights of fancy. I also found the ending did a disservice to the story.  There was no hope for Casper and Isabel and she should have been shown in the context of the ending of the novel.  At the conclusion of the novel, Isabel was left with two choices - return to Osmond or rescue Pansy.  Through Ralph, she had secured a financial legacy, with his passing she had acquired the freedom to make this choice, which were offered as a result of her own choices in life.  An ending fitting for a complex tale.",4,Excellent performances but curtailed ending,1363305600,"03 15, 2013",2013,2301,"['First', 'adaptation', 'can', 'ever', 'equal', 'great', 'book', 'Henry', 'James', 'had', 'gift', 'not', 'only', 'writing', 'displacement', 'also', 'writing', 'complicated', 'women', 'women', 'who', 'strive', 'better', 'place', 'better', 'solution', 'better', 'role', 'fill', 'limited', 'one', 'afforded', 'society', 'Isabel', 'Archer', 'one', 'greatest', 'creations', 'thought', 'was', 'wonderfully', 'played', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'difficult', 'role', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'easy', 'take', 'Isabel', 'gamut', 'emotions', 'start', 'finish', 'role', 'Isabel', 'being', 'woman', 'who', 'something', 'more', 'something', 'elusive', 'something', 'different', 'co-stars', 'provide', 'very', 'thing', 'longed', 'ultimate', 'sad', 'outcome.Martin', 'Donovan', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'deserve', 'extra', 'accolades', 'believability', 'lent', 'characterizations', 'Ralph', 'Touchett', 'Serena', 'Merle', 'Ralph', 'unacknowledged', 'heart', 'story', 'sad', 'demise', 'Isabel', 'realization', 'unintended', 'contribution', 'now', 'sad', 'life', 'Merle', 'consummate', 'American', 'sophisticate', 'expatriate', 'peeled', 'apart', 'layer', 'layer', 'screen', 'expertly', 'be', 'mosaic', 'person', 'different', 'character', 'person', 'ultimately', 'trapped', 'choices', 'made', 'ways', 'more', 'tragic', 'Isabel', 'other', 'ways', 'more', 'devious', 'Gilbert', 'hardest', 'roles', 'fill', 'onscreen', 'are', 'selfless', 'Ralph', 'complex', 'Merle', 'Martin', 'Barbara', 'were', 'perfectly', 'cast.The', 'direction', 'Jane', 'Campion', 'was', 'bit', 'frazzled', 'inserted', 'certain', 'dream', 'sequences', 'found', 'unnecessary', 'bizarre', 'Isabel', 'Henry', 'Jame', 'creation', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'headstrong', 'was', 'never', 'dreamy', 'prone', 'such', 'flights', 'fancy', 'also', 'found', 'ending', 'did', 'disservice', 'story', 'was', 'hope', 'Casper', 'Isabel', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'shown', 'context', 'ending', 'novel', 'conclusion', 'novel', 'Isabel', 'was', 'left', 'two', 'choices', 'return', 'Osmond', 'rescue', 'Pansy', 'Ralph', 'had', 'secured', 'financial', 'legacy', 'passing', 'had', 'acquired', 'freedom', 'make', 'choice', 'were', 'offered', 'result', 'own', 'choices', 'life', 'ending', 'fitting', 'complex', 'tale']",N/A

Jane Campion does not disappoint: each still from the film is like a painting. Gorgeous settings and exquisite costumes. The story is pretty clear for someone who like myself is not familiar with the novel. Young, beautiful and innocent Isabel Archer does not want to get married to the first or second gentleman who proposes to her. She believes that there is more for her in life. She wants to see other choices and experience an adventure. She meets Madame Merle and gets enwrapped in her manipulations. However, I do not want to tell you the whole plot. Some reviewers complained about the acting, but again I found no fault with it. Kidman's Isabel was genuine gentle misguided creature, whose suffering I could feel while watching the film. Hershey's character from the very beginning had some malignancy about her, and Malkovich was purely evil. Donovan's character was my favorite: quiet, sensitive, intelligent and loving.
