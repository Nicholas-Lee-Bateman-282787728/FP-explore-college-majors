981090,A3EBHHCZO6V2A4,B000F0UUSM,"Amaranth ""music fan""","[0, 0]","""Touch the Sound"" is a contemplative documentary about deaf percussionist Evelyn Glennie. At first, one can't tell she's deaf when she chats with her colleagues in the studio and Grand Central Station. She speaks in a normal way with the filmmaker-it's not till later Glennie reveals that she's been deaf since the age of 8. Her story is of triumph over adversity. Evelyn Glennie wanted to study music; when her deafness was discovered, her teachers discouraged her. Then, she found the magic of percussion. She doesn't see music as recreation or frivolity- but as necessary to life as food and sleep. Music saved her life; it saved her from despair.In ""Touch the Sound"", Evelyn travels from the tumult of New York City to the wild heaths of her native Scotland, to a quiet Zen garden in Japan. She revels in both the silence and the sound. In the Middle Ages, church organists were often blind. They were more attuned to the music, despite their lack of sight. Like them, Evelyn absorbs the sound into her very being, despite being deaf. Her deafness accentuates the power of sound- from the running of subways to the clacking of heels. Evelyn Glennie is passionate about her art. In one beautiful scene, she encourages a deaf student to play her drum.""Touch the Sound"" is a meditative movie. It's an exploration of a sonic world, a faith in things not heard, and a deep listening.",5,The Sound Moves Through You,1293840000,"01 1, 2011",2011,1382,"['Sound', 'contemplative', 'documentary', 'deaf', 'percussionist', 'Evelyn', 'Glennie', 'first', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'deaf', 'when', 'colleagues', 'studio', 'Grand', 'Central', 'Station', 'normal', 'way', 'filmmaker-it', 'not', 'till', 'later', 'Glennie', 'reveals', 'been', 'deaf', 'age', '8', 'story', 'triumph', 'adversity', 'Evelyn', 'Glennie', 'wanted', 'study', 'music', 'when', 'deafness', 'was', 'discovered', 'teachers', 'discouraged', 'Then', 'found', 'magic', 'percussion', ""n't"", 'see', 'music', 'recreation', 'frivolity-', 'necessary', 'life', 'food', 'sleep', 'Music', 'saved', 'life', 'saved', 'despair.In', 'Sound', 'Evelyn', 'tumult', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'wild', 'heaths', 'native', 'Scotland', 'quiet', 'Zen', 'garden', 'Japan', 'silence', 'sound', 'Middle', 'Ages', 'church', 'organists', 'were', 'often', 'blind', 'were', 'more', 'attuned', 'music', 'lack', 'sight', 'Evelyn', 'sound', 'very', 'being', 'being', 'deaf', 'deafness', 'power', 'sound-', 'running', 'subways', 'clacking', 'heels', 'Evelyn', 'Glennie', 'passionate', 'art', 'one', 'beautiful', 'scene', 'deaf', 'student', 'play', 'drum', 'Sound', 'meditative', 'movie', 'exploration', 'sonic', 'world', 'faith', 'things', 'not', 'heard', 'deep', 'listening']",Touch the Sound - A Sound Journey With Evelyn Glennie

This documentary presents the concept of sound in a way those of us who can hear don't usually think about. Evelyn Glennie is a percussionist who is deaf - something you don't normally see. This video captures her work, her philosophy, her style in an easy to follow format. While deaf, Ms. Glennie can speak quite articulately, and one has no difficulty following what she is saying.

Clendenin,"[0, 0]","In this documentary about her life and work, the percussionist Evelyn Glennie (a Grammy award-winner) does for sound what her fellow Scot and environmental artist Andy Goldsworthy did for sight in the film Rivers and Tides (2002). In fact, both films were directed by Thomas Riedelsheimer. ""My whole life,"" says Glennie, ""is about sound; it's what makes me tick as a human being."" That's a remarkable statement when about thirty minutes into the film you learn that by the time she was a teenager she was profoundly deaf. From playing a snare drum in New York's Grand Central Station, improvising with Fred Frith in an abandoned warehouse in Germany, visiting her brother at their family farm in Aberdeenshire, or staging an impromptu session in Tokyo using chop sticks on restaurant paraphernalia, Glennie explores the aesthetics, psychology and physicality of sound. Splattering water, pneumatic hammers at construction sites, a tap dancer, and general urban din all provide material for her reflections. Most of the sounds in the film are experimental, eerie, and dissonant, but to her credit Glennie amazes us with the complex miracle of one of our five senses.",4,how does she do it?!,1169596800,"01 24, 2007",2007,1165,"['documentary', 'life', 'work', 'percussionist', 'Evelyn', 'Glennie', 'Grammy', 'award-winner', 'sound', 'what', 'fellow', 'Scot', 'environmental', 'artist', 'Andy', 'Goldsworthy', 'did', 'sight', 'film', 'Rivers', 'Tides', '2002', 'fact', 'films', 'were', 'directed', 'Thomas', 'Riedelsheimer', 'whole', 'life', 'Glennie', 'sound', 'what', 'tick', 'human', 'being', 'remarkable', 'statement', 'when', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'film', 'learn', 'time', 'was', 'teenager', 'was', 'profoundly', 'deaf', 'playing', 'snare', 'drum', 'New', 'York', 'Grand', 'Central', 'Station', 'improvising', 'Fred', 'Frith', 'abandoned', 'warehouse', 'Germany', 'visiting', 'brother', 'family', 'farm', 'Aberdeenshire', 'staging', 'impromptu', 'session', 'Tokyo', 'using', 'chop', 'sticks', 'restaurant', 'paraphernalia', 'Glennie', 'aesthetics', 'psychology', 'physicality', 'sound', 'Splattering', 'water', 'pneumatic', 'hammers', 'construction', 'sites', 'tap', 'dancer', 'general', 'urban', 'din', 'provide', 'material', 'reflections', 'Most', 'sounds', 'film', 'are', 'experimental', 'eerie', 'dissonant', 'credit', 'Glennie', 'complex', 'miracle', 'one', 'five', 'senses']",Touch the Sound - A Sound Journey With Evelyn Glennie

As a subject, Glennie is not as eloquent as Goldworthy and her ""art"" is somehow less interesting.As a film that attempts to capture the artist process, it is a worthy attempt and should not really be compared to ""Rivers and Tides"".

While I agree that the actual performances are the most captivating part, the other parts of the film give us insight into why those performances are so captivating. Yes, it is a noisy world, so noisy that it can even inspire a deaf musician!As a percussionist, what I like most about this film, is that while Glennie is best known for her work with symphony orchestras, the music here is improvised. And with that, it is often very playful (not the serious stuff of classical music). Glennie is at her best when challenged by the avant garde guitar stylings of Fred Frith. His view of seeing everything as possible sound seems to inspire the natural curiousness of Glennie (Frith takes a bow to various metal beams in the abandoned factory they are filming in, noting the sounds they make). Their duo improvisations are the highlight of the film. [As a side note, it would have been nice to have an option to view all the material they did as a separate feature. And what about a CD of their improvisations???]Glennie is also playful and imaginative when she plays glasses, cans, and bottles in a Japanese club, showing that the music is in the musician, not the instruments. Surprisingly, some of the generous out takes reveal more of Glennie herself.All in all a fascinating portrait of a fascinating musician.

981099,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000F0UUSM,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[4, 5]","Touch the Sound (Thomas Riedelsheimer, 2004)I've watched two Thomas Riedelsheimer films this month, and have had a great deal of trouble reviewing either one. (I had no idea this was by Riedelsheimer when I DVRed it; I knew only that it was about Evelyn Glennie.) What that says about my method of approaching the films of Thomas Riedelsheimer I don't know. What I do know is that the best way to approach them is to sit back and let them wash over you. When you lock yourself into a Riedelsheimer joint, you're going to be buffeted with a large number of very attractive, somewhat loosely-joined images. There's no denying his films are documentaries, but often they seem as if they're documentaries as such things would have been filmed by Seurat, had he access to a handheld video camera.Touch the Sound seems to center on Evelyn Glennie's meetings with Fred Frith to record The Sugar Factory, but there's a lot more about Glennie than that short description would imply; playing in a subway station, a trip to Japan to study taiko drumming, teaching deaf school students the joy of percussion, other stuff, all surrounded by that Thomas Riedelsheimer mystique, lots of environmental shots and the like that seem to have little to do with what's going on. (They do; you just have to turn your mind a little way off-center to figure out how.)It should be noted, however, that a lot of people's reactions to this movie seem to hinge on whether or not they like the music being produced. This, of course, makes perfect sense, given that much of the movie's soundtrack comes from the Sugar Factory recordings; if avant-garde music isn't up your alley, you may want to give this one a pass.

981104,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000F0UUSM,Tsuyoshi,"[20, 20]","Thomas Riedelsheimer's ""Touch The Sound - A Sound Journey with Evelyn Glennie"" presents the captivating world of sound and music, perceived and played by Evelyn Glennie, a renowned percussionist. I confess I never knew her name before watching the film, and perhaps you don't know her, but if so, don't let that fact discourage you to watch the documentary.The documentary follows the journey of Evelyn Glennie traveling around the world - New York, Germany, Scotland, and Japan -- to discover the fascinating world of sound and music. For Evelyn, who has been hearing-impaired since she was 8 years-old, listening to sound and playing music should be called `touching the sound,' as the film's title suggest. And this documentary film, with the combination of beautiful images and thrilling music, is an attempt to explore the world perceived by Evelyn Glennie.Though the film contains the interview with Evelyn, it is most arresting when it shows the gifted musician playing and improvising the instruments. The most beautiful moments is Evelyn's solo performance of playing the snare drum at New York's Grand Central Station. Another two standout scenes in this documentary film are her improvisation with guitarist/composer Fred Frith in a huge deserted factory in Cologne, Germany, and the Taiko drummers of `Za Ondekoza' in Fuji City, Japan.The interviews given by Evelyn are slightly disappointing. Though the film brings her back to the farm in Aberdeen, Scotland, where she grew up as child, and gives her some occasions to talk about her views on sound and music, what she says sounds sometimes a bit too ordinary. She is mostly reticent about her life, and as to her remarks about the sound, the film includes the meditation at the Zen garden at Ryo-anji Temple in Kyoto, but it seems the artist is trying to find the right words to describe what she feels. Even the camera occasionally fails to reveal the artist's heart. When Evelyn is listening to the loud bleeping electronic sound of the basement food floor at department stores in Kyoto, what does her close-up face means? Is she enjoying it? Or is she annoyed by it?For all its flaws as documentary film, ""Touch The Sound - A Sound Journey with Evelyn Glennie"" has thrilling moments that easily make up for the lack of words.
