The Animation wasn't the best of the ""Walking-With"" Genre, but I still found it interesting.Behavioral and physical aspects of these supposed creatures of the future are interesting and, as I mentioned earlier, well thought out.My only gripe with this movie is that it is assumed that the climate gets too harsh for people in 5 million years, we leave, and that's where this starts. Now, be real. If humans haven't completely ravaged or destroyed the planet in 5 million years, we will be plenty advanced enough to survive a second ice age. If we could survive a first with stone working, animal furs and basic metallurgey, I think we could handle a second one 5 mllion years from now.But if you can pretend that humans are gone and the planet isn't destroyed, you'll enjoy this, as I did immensly.

This series is not as far-fetched as it seems. Scientists comment through the whole series and explain how and why these animals might evolve. Some of the theories seem insane like their idea that squid will take the place of humans as the dominant species on the planet, but the way the scientists explain these possibilities, the idea becomes understandable, and even possilble.

788856,A1IQV6AI7L9NOK,B0000YEDYU,Feelah the tigress,"[2, 2]","""The Future Is Wild"" is a rather cool concept for a program.  There's tons of dinosaur themed documentaries out there that look at ancient fauna and their evolution, but this is really the only show I've seen that speculates about the future.  Obviously, it's not a real ""documentary"" in the literal sense because it's 100% speculative fiction, but it is scientifically informed speculation, so it's quite interesting and fun.The whole premise of ""The Future Is Wild"" is that humans are gone from earth and the audience now gets to see what might happen in the evolution of the remaining animals there.  The DVD series is quite long (about 5 hours total) and spans as far as 200 million years into the future.  The imaginative views of what new animals would evolve over time are quite interesting, but obviously there's no way to know how true they would be because something as huge as evolution that far into the future would be very difficult to predict.  Still, the scientists who worked with the film makers do stop to give exposition about their reasoning behind a particular animal and what it evolved from and why, and I appreciated these segments.  Overall, I felt that the explanations and reasoning given for certain animal designs were pretty sound, but that the names given to the animals were pretty silly (""Phlish"" and ""Slither Suckers"").  To be fair though, that's the sort of names that people would give to new animals - just very descriptive ones.  Some of them still sound pretty silly though.  As for any other complaints I have...  I'm annoyed that the DVDs don't have a ""play all"" option.  You have to select and play each episode (4 per disc) individually.  That was a bit more inconvenient, but not a deal breaker or anything.  Lastly, I'm a bit disappointed that there are no special features of any kind.  None.So, do I recommend this DVD set?  Well, if the premise I described earlier sounds interesting to you and you can withstand some silliness, then give it a try.  If it doesn't, then obviously give it a pass.

788858,A230ZS8F6I0AGM,B0000YEDYU,"hawthorne wood ""hawthorne wood""","[4, 13]","I think I saw this once, without the scientific commentary, and it was fantastic.  I don't believe, as one reviewer said here, that you have to be more than an ""average joe"" to understand the commentaries by illustrious teachers, because what they're saying isn't that complex, and it's explained by well-drawn digital diagrams, etc.  In fact, the digital stuff is exquisite.  It's just too bad there's not more of it, and I think in the original I saw I loved it because it just went from one digital image to another, and the artistry was marvelous.  Frankly, I was shocked at how boring the scientific commentary was.  At the risk of sounding anti-intellectual (which I am not - I'm a writer and teacher myself) I have to wonder why these incredibly frumpy, lumpy, dumpy scientists were allowed to appear as themselves on what was otherwise a slick and attractive presentation (although there was nowhere near as much variety as there could have been - the repetitiveness of the imagery in this version nearly drove me mad).  What I'm saying is that if you are going to create a commercial film for mass consumption, at least make sure that your stars trim their hair, wear well-fitting clothing that at least camouflages a paunch, and get rid of of the absurd accessories, i.e., floppy, printed day-glow bow-ties and matching pocket handkerchiefs. The public is used to well-groomed celebrities and presenters, but that's not what I am talking about.  It's nice to see ""real"" people in commercial productions.  However - even ""real"" people can present a semblance of taste, when appearing before the public.  The only thing that redeems these geeks is the fact that they resemble, somewhat, the creatures they are describing, especially the giant squid at the end with eight klutzy legs and the pulsing blue light on its forehead: a very attractive millipod or whatever the freak it was.  Enough.  I just threw the freaking thing against the wall in frustration.  I suppose I'll have to write again and make amends for my rude commentary.  But really - is this thing actually a comedy?  By the end of it my husband I were writhing on the floor in hysterical laughter.  Jim Carey should do a take-off.  Love you, guys; geniuses.

788861,AQBRMBQ99ESI7,B0000YEDYU,"John A Lee III ""jal3""","[46, 46]","I did not have high hopes for this series. I assumed it would be rather silly and was looking to be entertained by the strange and the bizarre. I did find those aspects but I found more as well.These programs look at the possible evolution of life in the future without humans and in radically different environments. These speculative life forms are interesting but I expected nothing beyond wild, ""artists' conceptions"". The results are wild but they are based on informed speculation. However bizarre the hypothetical creature presented is, it is compared to current fauna with similar or analogous features. Those features are just taken further and the results are interesting to watch.This program could be looked upon as a way to teach the fundamental ideas of natural selection in a new and different manner; looking to the future instead of the past.Episode synopses appear below:Disc One: 5 Million Years - Ice Age WorldWelcome to the Future - This first episode sets out the suppositions. It postulates a world without humans in which natural selection has had free reign to produce bizarre new life forms. Three time periods are posited. The first is about 5 million years from now. The earth is in the grip of a terrible ice age and the life forms are adapted accordingly. The next scenario takes the opposite extreme. It takes place 100 million years in the future and is a hothouse world. To change things even more dramatically, the third epoch conceived is 200 million years in the future and takes place after a mass extinction event in which most species are killed and the few survivors adapt and radiate into the strangest life forms of all. Each period provides brief glances at some to the imaginary life forms of the future but none is examined in any real depth. This episode serves to set the stage for what is to come by giving the background.Return of the Ice - This episode concentrate on an arctic environment about 5 million years in the future. Some of the life forms presented include a large rodent which travels in herds, a bird evolved to take the place of toothed whales and a large carnivore that preys on both of them.The Vanished Sea - Taking place in the same ice age of the previous episode, this episode examines a completely different environment. The locus is the Mediterranean Sea with a big difference from the present day. It is all dried up and is now a salt desert supporting only specifically adapted animals. The ones examined closely in this episode are a large frilled lizard living on the salt flats, a descendant of the martin which is now a major predator and a highly evolved pig.The Prairies of Amazonia - In this episode we visit yet another biome of the ice age of the future. This one is the vast grassland that occupies most of the continent of South America. It has replaced the Amazon and there are some new and different creatures but, by and large, these creatures face the same challenges that confront today's inhabitants of savannahs. We are introduced to a tool making monkey that bears some resemblance to a baboon, a large flightless bird which has become a top predator and a large rodent which has evolved defensive armor.Cold Kansas Desert - The climate this time is the great desert of the North American Midwest. This desert, though, is frigid owing to the great ice fields. Here, we encounter a large rodent related to the ones of the grasslands of the previous episode. They feed on the same tubers as a small, burrowing descendant of the quail; one with a hive oriented social structure. These flightless birds are the principal prey of gigantic, carnivorous bats which roam the skies looking for easy pickings; they are the evolutionary successors to the buzzards.Disc Two: 100 Million Years - Hothouse WorldWaterland - An additional 95 million years has passed since the time of the previous disk and the world has changed a lot. It is a very hot and very moist world and life has had to adapt. This first episode takes place in a swamp environment. Huge descendants of turtles, the largest land animal ever to walk the earth, stalk the swamps looking for vegetation to eat. Trying to keep out of the way are terrestrial (amphibious) octopi. These mollusks have colonized the land seeking safety from large, predatory fish which use electricity on a scale not envisioned by our modern eels.Flooded World - I like coelenterates as much as the next guy but this episode didn't do much for me. It focuses on the shallow seas of the hothouse earth. The major critters are a huge jellyfish that actually consists of a variety of creatures working together for the common good, a sea slug that has become as mobile as your average fish and a sea spider that exists to protect the big jellyfish.Tropical Antarctica - Antarctica has migrated from its position over the southern pole and has become a lush, tropical jungle. Many of the depicted life forms are evolved from petrels. Some take the role of a hummingbird and another has evolved a noxious chemical weapon system. Very large insects are a major predator but smaller insects get their licks in as well. This was a pretty good episode.The Great Plateau - This episode takes place on a mountain plateau that makes the Himalayas look like minor foothills. Its inhabitants include giant, blue birds with four wings, large spiders that build webs across canyons and which farm mammals and these curious mammals which are the last ones left on earth. It's another really good episode.Disc Three: 200 Million Years - New WorldThe Endless Desert - It's a new world. Vulcanism and an asteroid strike have changed the planet immensely. The continents coming together to form a super-continent has also had an effect. Most of the earth is a vast desert. The wiping out of most species has provided new opportunities for a few. A termite has evolved to be adapted to hunting, agriculture and mining. Worms have it good as well and demonstrate both agrarian and hunting varieties.The Global Ocean - One continent means that there is once ocean as well and this ocean has seen some major changes. Fish are virtually gone. Their multitudinous places in the ecosystems have been taken over by arthropods. Fish are not completely gone, however. Some have become real flying creatures that can breath air. Cephalopods are around as well and they have evolved. Their intelligence is greater and their camouflage is more effective. They can also get huge. Some things remain the same, however. Sharks are still efficient killers; they have just further refined their methods.Graveyard Desert - More troubles in the desert are the theme of this one as we learn about scavenging beetles, scavenging worms, hopping snails and some carnivorous plants that feed on larger life forms than small bugs. This has been the only episode thus far where a plant is a significant part of the show.The Tentacled Forest - Although most of the land is a great desert, there is a magnificent rainforest along the coast. In this environment there are more fish turned to land dwelling flying creatures, giant lichens which resemble trees, slime molds that hunt and a gigantic, walking terrestrial squid. To top things off, there is another squid which dwells in the trees and swings around like an ape. These are intelligent squids and the possibility is left open that they will further involve and become...civilized.",4,Not as Silly as I Had Supposed!,1140912000,"02 26, 2006",2006,7415,"['did',

This thing has the funniest collection of nerdy scientists EVER. It's like they've gone out of their way to find the most stereotypical ivory tower twits in the scientific community. I began to wonder if they were real or actors costumed by a really good designer. I mean the rumpled coats and bow ties with funky awful hair and glasses abound to the point of absurdity! TOO FUNNY!Still, what they are there for and telling us is how they came up with the wild future animals based on what has evolved in the past and it all has a logic to it.But don't get your panties in a twist. It's all just speculation informed a bit by what we know. Don't get too serious This is supposed to be FUN.And it is.It's a great ride. Punctuated by the funniest scientists ever to evolve. So tie that bow tie, get a pocket protector, pop some corn, sit back and just go with the flow. It's great fun. Enjoy!I give it 4 stars because I'm not too fond of the narrator's voice.

That is what we all saw on the Animal Planet version of this show. Each of the ages was treated the same in the full length episodes as they were in the introductery condenced one hour form. They added probes and the omnipresent narrarator to guide us through each hour. I was enthralled with the whole weird thing! Completely swept away!So,when I got this collection of British talking heads beaming at how smart they all were to have theorised all these creatures out of nothing but thin air-headedness,I was disenchanted at best. They all came off as arrogant and way too self satisfied.While listening you could hear the flaws in many of the basic assumtions.The ecologies and behaiviors shown were often far too over simplified to create their ""new possibilities"". As a viewer your suspention of disbelief was completely shot! There was no way to invest your imagination in these soap bubble epocs being constantly reminded that they are just creations.Obviously,I am in the minority here and I'm shouting ""FIRE"" long after the smoke has cooled.So be it. This is one of the very few times that the more intellectual cut was all wrong. The US versions were much better films in every way; repeat footage and all. You were viewing events,not ideas.

Most of it is very interesting and while the DVDs have no extras, the episodes do, in the form of scientists explaining in detail what examples of animals in the past or in the present allowed them to design such wonderful new future creatures.
