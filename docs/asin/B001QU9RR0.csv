1232077,ARNAOSKQZMM2J,B001QU9RR0,Amanda,"[16, 16]","The drama continues in Beverly Hills 90210: The Seventh Season as everyone's favorite drama crew begins their senior year of college at California University. The dramatic characters of 90210 return for another season of soap opera-quality teen drama: Val Malone (Tiffani-Amber Thiessen), Brandon Walsh (Jason Priestly), Steve Sanders (Ian Ziering), Donna Martin (Tori Spelling), David Silver (Brian Austin Green), Kelly Taylor (Jennie Garth), and Clare Arnold (Kathleen Robertson).Season seven picks up during the summer just before the beginning of senior year at C.U. Brandon and Steve are in the middle of a cross-country drive before returning to Beverly Hills for the school year. Once school begins, Brandon engrosses himself in the campus television station (as well as a new, Kelly-free relationship) while Steve fights to stay in school and land a job... all while still keeping Clare and her father, the C.U. chancellor, happy with him.Meanwhile, Val struggles with financial trouble at her club, After Dark. She decides to seek out help from a family friend, but things get out of hand when when an unexpected pregnancy creates friction between Val and the other 90210-ers.Clare continues to struggle in her relationship with Steve while trying to balance her goals and issues with adjusting to new challenges. Even though Clare is known for keeping Steve in a relationship the longest in the show's history, there is constant trouble between the two as Steve falls back into his carefree ways.Donna and David's tempestuous relationship continues throughout the season, ranging from perfectly calm to breakup. Both characters try to encourage their friends and one another to finish up college, but things become difficult when David decides to drop out of college and suffers serious mental problems while Donna's former attacker and near-rapist begins stalking her again.Kelly revisits her past with Brandon and struggles with lingering feelings that collide with other characters. She also attempts to become friends with her long-time nemesis, Val, but the two girls seem to be more prone to fighting than being friends.Season seven ends with a highly satisfying college graduation for all of the cast members, but it leaves the audience wondering: what's going to happen next? How can we possibly keep following all these characters as they grow up, get jobs, and move on with their careers? Even though the series still feels like it has some life left in it, the two-part graduation special made the story seemed a little final.But by the far the best part of this DVD set is being able to experience all of your favorite Beverly Hills 90210 drama in the privacy of your own home (complete with tissue box) in a complete and newly restored, remastered version that looks unlike any other version of the series out there. While non-fans may have a little trouble getting into the constantly intense drama of the series, long-time fans will be delighted with the quality and completeness of this 7-disc collectible DVD set.",4,The drama continues during senior year,1241740800,"05 8, 2009",2009,3040,"['drama', 'Beverly', 'Hills', '90210', 'Seventh', 'Season', 'everyone', 'favorite', 'drama', 'crew', 'senior', 'year', 'college', 'California', 'University', 'dramatic', 'characters', '90210', 'return', 'season', 'soap', 'opera-quality', 'teen', 'drama', 'Val', 'Malone', 'Tiffani-Amber', 'Thiessen', 'Brandon', 'Walsh', 'Jason', 'Priestly', 'Steve', 'Sanders', 'Ian', 'Ziering', 'Donna', 'Martin', 'Tori', 'Spelling', 'David', 'Silver', 'Brian', 'Austin', 'Green', 'Kelly', 'Taylor', 'Jennie', 'Garth', 'Clare', 'Arnold', 'Kathleen', 'Robertson', '.Season', 'seven', 'up', 'summer', 'just', 'beginning', 'senior', 'year', 'C.U', 'Brandon', 'Steve', 'are', 'middle', 'cross-country', 'drive', 'returning', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'school', 'year', 'Once', 'school', 'begins', 'Brandon', 'campus', 'television', 'station', 'as', 'well', 'new', 'Kelly-free', 'relationship', 'Steve', 'fights', 'stay', 'school', 'land', 'job', 'still', 'keeping', 'Clare', 'father', 'C.U', 'chancellor', 'happy', 'him.Meanwhile', 'Val', 'financial', 'trouble', 'club', 'Dark', 'seek', 'out', 'help', 'family', 'friend', 'things', 'get', 'hand', 'when', 'when', 'unexpected', 'pregnancy', 'friction', 'Val', 'other', '90210-ers.Clare', 'struggle', 'relationship', 'Steve', 'trying', 'balance', 'goals', 'issues', 'adjusting', 'new', 'challenges', 'Even', 'Clare', 'known', 'keeping', 'Steve', 'relationship', 'longest', 'show', 'history', 'constant', 'trouble', 'two', 'Steve', 'back', 'carefree', 'ways.Donna', 'David', 'tempestuous', 'relationship', 'season', 'ranging', 'perfectly', 'calm', 'breakup', 'characters', 'try', 'encourage', 'friends', 'one', 'finish', 'up', 'college', 'things', 'become', 'difficult', 'when', 'David', 'drop', 'college', 'suffers', 'serious', 'mental', 'problems', 'Donna', 'former', 'attacker', 'near-rapist', 'begins', 'stalking', 'again.Kelly', 'past', 'Brandon', 'lingering', 'feelings', 'collide', 'other', 'characters', 'also', 'become', 'friends', 'long-time', 'nemesis', 'Val', 'two', 'girls', 'seem', 'be', 'more', 'prone', 'fighting', 'being', 'friends.Season', 'seven', 'ends', 'highly', 'satisfying', 'college', 'graduation', 'cast', 'members', 'audience', 'wondering', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'How', 'can', 'possibly', 'keep', 'following', 'characters', 'grow', 'up', 'get', 'jobs', 'move', 'careers', 'Even', 'series', 'still', 'life', 'left', 'two-part', 'graduation', 'special', 'made', 'story', 'seemed', 'little', 'final.But', 'far', 'best', 'part', 'DVD', 'set', 'being', 'able', 'experience', 'favorite', 'Beverly', 'Hills', '90210', 'drama', 'privacy', 'own', 'home', 'complete', 'tissue', 'box', 'complete', 'newly', 'restored', 'remastered', 'version', 'other', 'version', 'series', 'there', 'non-fans', 'may', 'have', 'little', 'trouble', 'getting', 'constantly', 'intense', 'drama', 'series', 'long-time', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'delighted', 'quality', 'completeness', '7-disc', 'collectible', 'DVD', 'set']","Beverly Hills, 90210: Season 7"

1232079,A1PASRZ81DY9C,B001QU9RR0,Austin Somlo,"[1, 2]","Beverly Hills 90210 is still going strong after six seasons and is entering into seventh season. All I can say is: is it really going strong? I'll have to say...no. I complained about the prior season for having too much of recurring characters that overstayed their welcome. I thought this problem was more ameliorated in seventh season yet some of them stayed far too short and dropped out like flies. Any time a main character breaks up with a secondary character, s/he is conveniently never seen again. The biggest downfall of Season Seven is the recycling of the same old topics. First, Dylan had a drug problem. Then, Brandon had it. On we go to David. Then, Kelly had it. Finally, of all people, Steve was ready to overdose on heroin. This one was really hard for me to believe. Worst of all, no matter how tragic a situation becomes, nobody ever suffered. It's like, ""It's so serious that it's impossible to believe anyone will die of it or whatever."" And of course, nobody did, and all were back for more episodes as usual. That was the biggest failure of the series; please, for a change, just try to have one main character, preferably David, to die; then the show can have its credibility restored. All right, let's review each of the main characters, shall we?Brandon: The hypocrite is still at it. I felt pretty bad for Tracy Gaylian. She was a very nice girl and a dramatic improvement over Susan Keats. Remembering that episode where Sam from the Ranch would beat Brandon up if he mistreated Tracy? I was really hoping for that to happen. I knew the relationship was going to be a disaster when it turned out to be a workplace romance, and these things never work out for the best. Didn't we see this already with Susan from last season? Too much recycled material going on. When Brandon was trying to have an argument with Kelly about her secretly going to airport to see Dylan after receiving a surprise telegram, Brandon practically said that it was not fair that she was with him while being in love with somebody else. Whoa...whoa...wait a minute, didn't he just do that already to Tracy, and how horribly unfair was it to Tracy the entire time? Brandon really gets the King of Hypocrites award. You know, Brandon is always talking about morals and living by them, yet he has a fling with a stripper for a weekend. Explain that one to me. So, after seven season, Brandon, at age of 21, has slept with thirty or forty women already? He wins the Playa of Beverly Hills award also! Hmm...Brandon won the Dryer award and Best Student of graduating class and was an Honors student. You must be kidding me; he is none of that because he is not the kind of a person capable of winning or doing any of them. At best, he is just a good, typical college student but no more than that.Kelly: The second favorite character is back but this time with less drama than the prior season. Almost too often, Kelly, as well as other main characters, faces these life-threatening situations and never suffers the tragedy. It was particularly nice to see Michael Stoyanov, a good talented actor from Blossom whose work was largely overshadowed by a huge fan favorite Joey Lawrence, to guest star in some episodes. On the other hand, I found Mark Reese's departure to be the weirdest of any because right after he lost the Dryer award, he just suddenly transferred out of school? What the heck?Donna: Ah, the poor idiot Donna. Still the same yet still boring as ever. But what's with her hideous hair? That has to rank one of the all-time worst hair disasters ever. She finally loses her virginity in the season finale, but I must ask, is it so important to make a big deal out of it? Really? Anyway, I hated her mother and still do. I just have an incredibly hard time deciding on who was the worst character of the show history: Brenda Walsh or Felice Martin? It's just so dead even, but I may give the nod to Felice.David: If any of the remaining main characters had to be cut out of the show for good, it's David. He is just as annoying as ever and is the worst character of the group. Every episode I watch and every time he appears, the world must revolve around David's, no other exceptions. Ever wondered why David is no longer with Valerie or Clare but is with Donna? It's because David can't control the first two, but with Donna, she is just too easy to control. And she ends up being his toy to abuse with. Oh yeah, David has verbally and mentally abused Donna for so many years; it's pretty sickening to watch. I just get ticked anytime I see his annoying face on screen and want to punch him in the nose. Of anyone in the cast, Brian Austin Green is the worst actor; pretty much constantly for seven years, while speaking his lines, he would look up, down, up, down, up down; that's a very extremely limited acting range.Steve: The most favorite character continues to serve up the fun for the show. Unfortunately, he has become so p*ssywhipped that he is just a weak person. He should have broken up with Clare a long time ago and declared her to be a good riddance. Hopefully, after Clare is finally all gone, Steve will return his old mojo back for Eighth Season. I am very surprised that he got addicted to pot and was ready to try White China. That's so unlike Steve.Valerie: *sighs* Valerie...Valerie...Valerie...she is so stupid that she can't even realize the difference between a dog and a cat. She is so easy that she will sleep with anybody; just be nice to her for a few minutes, and she is yours for good until something bad happens. I just knew after the meeting with Derek Driscoll, a wonderful trip on a memory lane because that's Corin Nemec from the old television show Parker Lewis Can't Lose, it was a scam all the way through. Valerie gets pathetic for the entire season and is at her worst in season finale after committing a fake suicide so she can live in Brandon's house...rent free...in Beverly Hills. It's time to kick her off the show and move on; she thoroughly sucks and has nothing to offer because her act is so old and threadbare.Clare: Bye-bye, Clare...I hate you and never want to see you again. All that crap about her mommy's death nearly every episode is just one big, huge pathetic attempt to make everybody, especially Steve, to feel sorry for her. Hey Clare...shut the hell up. And also, she would make a big deal out of nothing and start these ridiculous fights with Steve over absolutely nothing. That was a very draining aspect on the show: it's just the same problem over and over. I am like, ""Steve, buddy...dump her and move on."" This should have happened many episodes ago. Hey Clare...shut the hell up. Finally, she would go on and on about how her father is so lonely and all that. I got a better idea, Clare...why don't you sleep with him? And yeah...shut the hell up, too.Elsewhere, Dylan's presence is missed, and in a way, he is badly needed to get the show going because it's truly almost running on fumes. I found the idea of the rapist being free after serving two years of prison ridiculous and impossible. Not in California. The season finale was pretty bland, and I didn't find the college graduation all that worth it to watch as compared to their old high school graduation. Looking at the size of the class of 1997, yeah...right for a major California University. Speaking of graduates, I found it interesting that all of the members of the cast graduated in four years perfectly, yeah...right. Even funnier, after four years, I still have no idea what collegiate major of each was except for Kelly's. They sure put in very little effort and graduated very nicely afterwards. I see that there is simply too much champagne drinking going on in the show. All in all, I am seriously looking forward to Season Ten of Beverly Hills 90210 because it is becoming a waste of time: it's just routine and bunch of nothing but the boring going-through-motions maintenance of daily life with a lot of recycled ideas.",4,Almost Running on Fumes in Season Seven.,1306195200,"05 24, 2011",2011,7980,"['Beverly', 'Hills', '90210', 'still', 'going', 'strong', 'six',

We usually haven't had to wait more than 4 or 5 months for a new season to be released, which is good enough timing to allow us to finish watching one before we are ready for another, and it definitely looks like we will be getting the entire series. I'm a little more worried about Melrose Place, the last couple of releases have been suspicious, first with the different packaging starting with season 4, then the long wait for season 5, then we find out that Season 5 is only HALF a season...anyway back to 90210. The music changes suck, yes. In a perfect world we'd have the series as we remembered it.  I've also heard that some of the episodes are the edited versions. But hey, at least we are getting a decent release. The packaging has been consistent, all the Seasons look great on my shelf next to each other! It kinda bugs me that they didn't include Kathleen Robertson or Jamie Walters on the covers of all of their seasons, and the fact that for the first 3 season sets they used a cover picture from the following season (Season 1 had a season 2 picture, season 2 had a season 3 picture, season 3 had a season 4 picture, that's why season 4  didn't have a group shot because they had used it already!)  but whatever, and the special features stopped at Season 4, but I'm glad I get to watch the series again.",4,90210 Keeps Coming,1239148800,"04 8, 2009",2009,1503,"[""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'reviewing', 'season', '7', 'i', 'just', 'got', 'yesterday', 'i', 'have', ""n't"", 'gone', 'yet', 'just', 'wanted', 'say', 'how', 'happy', 'am', 'release', 'schedule', 'series', 'usually', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'wait', 'more', '4', '5', 'months', 'new', 'season', 'be', 'released', 'good', 'enough', 'timing', 'allow', 'finish', 'watching', 'one', 'are', 'ready', 'definitely', 'will', 'be', 'getting', 'entire', 'series', ""'m"", 'little', 'more', 'worried', 'Melrose', 'Place', 'last', 'couple', 'releases', 'have', 'been', 'suspicious', 'first', 'different', 'packaging', 'starting', 'season', '4', 'then', 'long', 'wait', 'season', '5', 'then', 'find', 'out', 'Season', '5', 'only', 'HALF', 'season', 'anyway', 'back', '90210', 'music', 'suck', 'yes', 'perfect', 'world', ""'d"", 'have', 'series', 'remembered', ""'ve"", 'also', 'heard', 'episodes', 'are', 'edited', 'versions', 'hey', 'least', 'are', 'getting', 'decent', 'release', 'packaging', 'been', 'consistent', 'Seasons', 'look', 'great', 'shelf', 'other', 'kinda', 'bugs', 'did', ""n't"", 'include', 'Kathleen', 'Robertson', 'Jamie', 'Walters', 'covers', 'seasons', 'fact', 'first', '3', 'season', 'sets', 'used', 'cover', 'picture', 'following', 'season', 'Season', '1', 'had', 'season', '2', 'picture', 'season', '2', 'had', 'season', '3', 'picture', 'season', '3', 'had', 'season', '4', 'picture', 'why', 'season', '4', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'group', 'shot', 'had', 'used', 'already', 'special', 'features', 'stopped', 'Season', '4', ""'m"", 'glad', 'get', 'watch', 'series', 'again']","Beverly Hills, 90210: Season 7"

They changed her from being a fun, sarcastic character to just a whiner... the constant picking of fights got old...All things considered, this is another strong season of the show... it's slow to begin with but it's worth sticking with after you are in a few episodes and things take off... and it's kinda hard not to be wistful and nostalgic watching the gang graduate at the end.... this really is it, they are all grown up now....Looking forward to season 8, though i know the show kinda starts to lose its way in it and seasons 9 and 10 are kinda more soapy than ever and lots of characters come and go. Still, i will watch em all.....enjoy",4,much better than i remembered,1257897600,"11 11, 2009",2009,1845,"['i', 'have', 'just', 'finished', 'set', 'past', 'weekend', '.And', 'i', 'have', 'say', 'fan', 'show', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'season', 'i', 'remembered', 'most', 'seasons', 'show', 'slowly', 'gang', 'return', 'together', 'various', 'summer', 'activities', '5-', '6', 'episodes', 'really', 'going', 'show', 'finale', 'where', 'sense', 'characters', 'really', 'growing', 'up', 'prepare', 'leave', 'colege', 'big', 'bad', 'real', 'world', '.Highlights', 'season', 'Val', 'course', 'relationship', 'married', 'Kenny', 'Val', 'mom', 'Abby', 'visiting', 'learning', 'more', 'why', 'Val', 'so', 'screwed', 'up', 'relationship', 'dad', 'Val', 'Kelly', 'ongoing', 'bitchiness', 'jealousy', 'Brandon..Kelly', 'friendship', 'guy', 'HIV', 'David', 'brush', 'mental', 'illness', 'Donna', 'stalker', 'build-up', 'conclusion', 'being', 'held', 'hostage', 'Brandon', 'Tracey', 'relationship', 'was', 'nice', 'watch', 'til', 'Brandon', 'dilemma', 'getting', 'back', 'Kelly', 'Lowlights', '.well', 'clare', 'was', 'lot', 'less', 'fun', 'season', 'Steve', 'constant', 'bickering', 'silly', 'stuff', 'got', 'old', 'end', 'season', 'was', 'right', 'i', 'think', 'Clare', 'out', 'finale..', 'changed', 'being', 'fun', 'sarcastic', 'character', 'just', 'whiner', 'constant', 'picking', 'fights', 'got', 'old', 'things', 'considered', 'strong', 'season', 'show', 'slow', 'begin', 'worth', 'sticking', 'are', 'few', 'episodes', 'things', 'take', 'off', 'kinda', 'hard', 'not', 'be', 'wistful', 'nostalgic', 'watching', 'gang', 'graduate', 'end', 'really', 'are', 'grown', 'up', 'now', '.Looking', 'forward', 'season', '8', 'i', 'know', 'show', 'starts', 'lose', 'way', 'seasons', '9', '10', 'are', 'kinda', 'more', 'soapy', 'ever', 'lots', 'characters', 'come', 'go', 'Still', 'i', 'will', 'watch', 'em', '..enjoy']","Beverly Hills, 90210: Season 7"
