Then I saw that his audience was 90% black so I was really curious.I laughed so hard I had tears running down my face.  He talks about his white up bringing as well as his induction into the black community by way of his black wife and compares the two cultures.  He also talks about the challenges of raising bi-racial children.  Of course he exaggerates a little here and there but that is how it is done to get the point across.I think the funniest part was his comparison of the white church service and the black Southern Baptist Church.  I grew up in the Southern Baptist Church and the things that he said were my complaints as a child.  In other words I could relate.I also love it that he is just a comic not a white comic trying to be a black comic with white skin.,5,One of the Funniest Stand Up Comics I Have Seen in a Long Time,1354233600,"11 30, 2012",2012,904,"['had', 'never', 'heard', 'Gary', 'Owens', 'so', 'decided', 'watch', 'Showtime.When', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'thought', 'okay', 'what', 'Then', 'saw', 'audience', 'was', '90', '%', 'black', 'so', 'was', 'really', 'curious.I', 'laughed', 'so', 'hard', 'had', 'tears', 'running', 'down', 'face', 'white', 'up', 'bringing', 'as', 'well', 'induction', 'black', 'community', 'way', 'black', 'wife', 'two', 'cultures', 'also', 'challenges', 'raising', 'bi-racial', 'children', 'course', 'little', 'here', 'there', 'how', 'done', 'get', 'point', 'across.I', 'think', 'funniest', 'part', 'was', 'comparison', 'white', 'church', 'service', 'black', 'Southern', 'Baptist', 'Church', 'grew', 'up', 'Southern', 'Baptist', 'Church', 'things', 'said', 'were', 'complaints', 'child', 'other', 'words', 'could', 'relate.I', 'also', 'love', 'just', 'comic', 'not', 'white', 'comic', 'trying', 'be', 'black', 'comic', 'white', 'skin']",Gary Owen - Live In Concert
