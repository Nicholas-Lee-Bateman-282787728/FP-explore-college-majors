The story of 3 Aboriginal girls, ripped from their home to be integrated into white society ways because -- once again, someone determined that there was something wrong with non-white ways.  Their escape, a triumph!  Their journey after that is the story.  It shows that teaching a child to have a strong sense of family, to know who they are, they can go farther than even they knew.  The children give marvelous, nothing-less-than believable performances!!Ningali Lawford, who plays the Mom, is the reason I bought this DVD.  I saw her in a PBS Special (Vis a Vis: Native Tongue), talking about her life as an Aboriginal, comparing it with the life of a Native American, who was in the documentary with her.

598252,AJDYDG7YZY9QL,B00005JLD4,,"[5, 5]","Philip Noyce has transformed an epic journey into an example of visual poetry.  Three girls, kidnapped and destined for &quot;assimilation&quot; into white Australian society, escape their &quot;protectors&quot;.  In an astonishing journey, pursued by government police and an Aborigine tracker, they evade authority's clutches.  After seven weeks and eighteen hundred kilometres journey, they reach home.  Perhaps the longest foot journey in Australia.Noyce beautifully captures the harsh environment traversed by the trio, even though the filming was far distant from the actual location.  The girls must use every available cover and device to escape capture, and Noyce maintains the tension throughout the film.  Using numerous close-ups to convey feeling, you're kept aware that flight from captivity isn't a social event.  Encounters with either white or fellow Aborigines force reserve, suspicion and hesitation - talk is minimised, even among the three escapees.  This is a highly visual film in a setting providing oppotunities for lush images.It is the people, however, that give this film its true grandeur.  Clearly, the fleeing girls aren't professionals before the camera.  Everlyn Sampi's facial expressions seize the soul in nearly every scene.  She's aware of the burden she's carrying, leading the escape, keeping them free, thwarting detection and pursuit, finding the track.  David Gulpilil, the Aborigine tracker, also rivets the eye as he leads the quest to return the girls to the mission.  How does he feel in pursuit of his own kind in the employ of the dominant, racist, white society?  Kenneth Branagh might have absorbed the soul of A.O. Neville so graphically does he portray the &quot;Protector of Aborigines&quot;.  Called &quot;The Devil&quot; by Aborigines and seeming to personify all the worst aspects of a racist society, Neville was simply an extreme example of his society's mores.  Branagh clearly understands this fully, playing the role with marvelous reserve.This DVD is almost a novelty for other aspects.  The discriminating viewer will soon discover that the &quot;Special Features&quot; aren't something to by-pass lightly.  Instead of the usual long-winded interviews with directors, producers and actors, Noyce, with his usual skill offers something truly captivating.  He takes you on a &quot;hand-held camera&quot; journey to solicit the acting team from remote Australian communities.  We are introduced to the various children discovered, assessed and chosen for the roles.  These are but children suddenly confronted with a new world.  Their reactions are poignant and inspiring.Finally, the viewer will discover yet another level of reward in watching the film again with the voice-over commentary enabled.  Fresh surprises await the patient as Noyce discusses how the film came to him and his enthusiasm for it.  He relates his dealings with all the cast.  It is David Gulpilil who, with infinite subtlety, transforms the book's tracker into a wholly new and realistic character.  Every praise that can be imparted to the three children suddenly becomes remote as you discover Gulpilil manifests the two centuries of Aborigine-white encounters.  Buy this film in anticipation of many unexpected revelations.

598253,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B00005JLD4,Acute Observer,"[2, 3]","Rabbit-Proof Fence, 2002 filmThis movie is set in Australia around 1930 when half-caste Aboriginal children were forcibly removed and sent to government boarding schools for an education that would remove them from their stone-age lives. Three girls escaped to walk back to their mother, nearly a thousand miles. They were guided by the rabbit-proof fence that runs across Australia to control migrating rabbits. A native tracker is sent after them, but the girls know how to avoid leaving a trail (walking in streams). Some people help them with food or a warm coat. In time one of the girls is caught, but the other two succeed in returning to their mother.This story moves slowly at times, but it presents a recreation of rural Australia from the past. Something similar went on in America for the schooling of native American children in schools that removed them from their families. But you won't see a movie about that. Sending children away to school was also used by the ruling classes of England and America at that time, and to this day. How to give children a modern education is an ongoing problem for all today.Were rabbits native to Australia? If they were brought by English settlers, then escaped into the wild to become a pest, it would be a warning against invasive species When predators are eliminated their prey increases.

598254,A18BD98SU49UB7,B00005JLD4,"Adam Hunnicutt ""A.H.""","[3, 3]","Rabbit Proof Fence is an experience that will stay with me for a long time.During the Early 1900's the Australian government formed an organization that could declare parental rights over ""Caste"" aboriginal children. Their goal, a three generational breed-out of these lighter skinned children. In short, if they marry caucasions, and their own children do so, their grandchildren would be white. This would obliterate their race, a chilling notion that we have seen many times in history.After scanning reviews for Rabbit Proof Fence, I found that Roger Ebert actually wept at the end of the film. It is definately moving, and the fact that he wept shouldn't necessarily make you conclude its a sad film.

598255,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00005JLD4,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[2, 3]","""Rabbit-Proof Fence"" is a bit of a conundrum.  Upon watching this film, I was immediately taken aback with the steady use of widescreen cinematography, which graciously captured the beauty of Australia, despite the racist backgrounds.  I was pleasantly surprised by the ending, without giving too much away; I was unaware of the non-fiction elements surrounding these events.  ""Rabbit-Proof Fence"" equally provided an unknown chapter of Australia's history, while also being an emotional challenge from start to finish.  With such powerful, and compelling, arguments for this film, why was there a conundrum?  With such strong, documentary-like features, one could expect this to be a brilliant cinematic entry, yet what was troublesome, was that ""Rabbit-Proof Fence"" was only about average amongst films of this nature.  From a historical standpoint, it provided a new chapter unbeknownst to me concerning the racism, or eradication of the Aborigines race from society, but the ultimate pitfall of this film is the lack of depth in a ""PG"" rating.  Not that tortured children need to run the gamut of every historical film, but there was nothing (sans perhaps one scene) that demonstrated to me that these refugees were struggling in any way.  From the moment of escape until the emotional ending, not one time did I feel that these children were in danger; every scene possible was of them receiving help from either other Aborigines or from native Australians.  When these three girls made their presence known on screen, we were at a happy moment - nowhere within the 900 miles did we see famine, fatigue, or even pain.  One could argue that the collapse in the desert is one of them, but it doesn't arrive until the end of the feature.  Up until that point, we are left to assume that this is a simplistic walk and that any cuts found upon their legs were cautiously placed on from a make-up department head on the edge of the framed shot.I do not want to seem unsympathetic to the plight that these young girls took, it was not only a message to the Aborigines people, but also deflated the power of the Chief Protector (played by Kenneth Branagh - oddly, miscast in this feature).  This film was a struggle, it was emotionally draining to watch these girls desire nothing more than to just go home - but where ""Rabbit-Proof Fence"" fails is the lacking realism.  The reality that these girls made this trek is real, the struggles and hardships of what was happening in Australia during this time is real, the help seen from within - both from locals and other Aborigines - was very real, but the physical journey seemed too ""glossed"" to truly find yourself lost within these events.  When the girls are walking, their hair remains in place, they never change weight, and there seems to be no horrifying event happen to them (i.e. bones broken, animal attacks, or even Mother Nature).  It seemed perfect, and that is what irked me about this film, the images of hope overweighed the images of struggle.  Director Noyce did not give us a balance, thus never quite reaching that true emotional punch at the end.Secondly, the concept of the ""Rabbit-Proof Fence"" was surprising, I had no notion that this even existed, and after watching this film I wanted to know more.  This was another pitfall to this film.  Noyce should have given us, either in words or images, a bit of a history of the fence, and what it represented.  The symbolism throughout the film became apparent, but knowing more about this fence would have only strengthened the cause.  Finally, did anyone else wish that we could spend more time with the reconstruction camps and not with Branagh?  Again, not knowing enough about these camps, I wished to see what the religion was doing to these children.  I feel like we didn't get enough of this to fully see the horrors that were happening.  We heard Branagh's speech about ""why"" these were created, but it would have been interesting to hear it from the women of the robe's mouths.  There needed to be more of an emotional strain when these children ran away, I wanted to see that they desired to escape the teachings, not just go visit their boyfriends.With that said, everything else that Noyce did worked perfectly.  The score by Peter Gabriel was fantastic, adding to the sounds of the Aborigines.  The cinematography was perfect.  The widescreen shots, seen on a projector screen, were breathtaking as we traveled along the outback.  ""Rabbit-Proof Fence"" was a decent film.  It was a great history lesson, and compelled me to learn more about a country I hardly think about in my day-to-day life.  My biggest issue with this film was the lack of ""realism"" surrounding the girls' journey.  I wanted more emotion, more hardship, more struggle - the lack of such made me feel like I, a average guy could make this journey.Grade: **  out of *****",3,The Rabbit-Proof Fence less

598257,ATDE9JYCPI0L1,B00005JLD4,Alyssa A. Lappen,"[7, 9]","For 25 years, through 1940, A.O. Neville (Kenneth Branagh) served as the Australian government minister in charge of Aborigine affairs. This movie portrays the true story of several of his victims.The government authorities rounded by Aborigines and forced them to live in allotted areas, where they controlled every aspect of their daily lives, right down to how many pairs of shoes each individual could receive. The worst lot fell upon the mixed children of Aborigine mothers, whom this movie implies were often (if not always) raped by white men.In 1931, Molly Craig (Everlyn Sampi), then 14, her sister Daisy Kadibill (Tianna Sansbury), 8, and their 10-year-old cousin Gracie Fields (Laura Monaghan) visited the Jigalong trading post with the girls' mother Maud (Ningali Lawford) and their grandmother (Myarn Lawford) and found themselves hunted down like rabbits by the government's police, whom Neville had authorized to kidnap them to be raised at Moore River, a ""school"" camp to ""civilize"" Aborigine ""half-castes.""The school was in fact a sort of prison; frequent escapees were tracked and quickly returned. And even their tracker, Moodoo (David Gulpilil) was effectively imprisoned there. Not only was his daughter also a victim of the government policy, but he was refused frequent requests to return to his home. Much like the children of Native Americans, kidnapped and confined to similar ""English only"" schools until well into the 1960s, these girls were mistreated badly, and had their hair cut off for daring to speak Aborigine--or, heaven forefend--escape.Before the girls' capture, Molly had often seen the ""rabbit proof fence,"" constructed from north to south across Australia to keep western rabbits out of the pastures and ranch lands. Her mother had also shown  her the ""spirit birds"" (whistling kites), which she'd said would always watch over Molly.And so it is that, after being transported in cages, by truck and train, some 1,200 miles from home--and  a very brief separation from their family--the girls follow Molly's lead and set out to return home. The film mostly tells of their nine week journey across harsh outback and desert--to the background music of whistling kites and Australia's haunting Aboriginal didgeridoo, the lengthy, 1- to 2-meter low-toned wind instrument.Adapted from the book of Molly's daughter--the award-winning author, Doris Pilkington--the film very effectively personalizes the plight suffered by many Aborigine parents and children from 1905 through 1971. Molly Craig died in January 2004, at the age of 87.Unfortunately, several governments still separate children of ""unwanted"" minorities from their parents, to this day. These aren't the ""Western colonial"" governments that viewers might expect; They include Hungary and Romania, who target Rom children and families, as well as African and Asian governments, who persecute other minorities.Moreover, historically, separating minority children from their families and raising them differently was and remains a time honored practice within the institution ofIslamic jihad.--Alyssa A.

598258,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JLD4,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","Some films just touch something inside you that you didn't know was there.  For me, `Rabbit-Proof Fence' is one of those films.  It is honest, heartfelt, brutal and reaching.  It is also one of those hidden gems that don't get a lot of attention.  In fact, in a year as rich as 2002, this beautiful film was all but forgotten come awards season.  Instead, it was disregarded for big budget mediocrity like `Gangs of New York'.Sad; very sad.`Rabbit-Proof Fence' tells the true story of young Molly and her sister Daisy and her cousin Gracie as they escape from a training camp in Australia, year 1931.  During the years between 1905 and 1971 (HUGE time span), law in Australia allowed white settlers to basically kidnap half-castle children (that is half white/half aboriginal) and place them in camps where they were integrated into white society.  The purpose of these camps was to basically stamp out the race, forcing these young children to mate with whites in order to phase out their race.  Molly, Daisy and Gracie were stripped from their homes and brought to one of these camps.But they escaped.After fleeing from their brutal new home, these three girls made the 1,500 mile trek (along the rabbit-proof fence) back to their homes, covering desert for nine months.  As grueling and dangerous as their journey was, it serves as one of the most heartwarming and uplifting stories put to screen.Adapted from the book of the same name, which was actually written by Molly's very own daughter, Doris Pilkington Garimara, this beautiful film is bound to touch your heart.  The performances by the entire cast, especially these three young girls (Everlyn Sampi, Tianna Sansbury and Laura Monaghan), are outstanding and very raw and real.  Everlyn Sampi especially carries this film with such honesty.  I was amazed at her beautiful performance.  Kenneth Branagh (yes THAT Kenneth Branagh) is brilliantly used as the enforcer at the camp.  His steely gaze breathes a subtle evil that never overdoes it but respectfully (if you can call it that) approaches this man's wrong ways with honesty and realism.`Rabbit-Proof Fence' is a film that broaches the subject of racism in a way that will make it a real issue for us.  Instead of tacking a slew of clich&eacute;s in a row and calling it provocative (`Crash'), this film uses a subtle yet harrowing approach to give validity to a horrible atrocity.  This film makes racism real to the viewer and raises awareness of the disease.This is a brilliant film that everyone should make a point to see!",5,The definition of `hidden gem'...,1274400000,"05 21, 2010",2010,2543,"['films', 'just', 'touch', 'something', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'there', 'Rabbit-Proof', 'Fence', 'one', 'films', 'honest', 'heartfelt', 'brutal', 'reaching', 'also', 'one', 'hidden', 'gems', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'lot', 'attention', 'fact', 'year', 'as', 'rich', '2002', 'beautiful', 'film', 'was', 'forgotten', 'come', 'awards', 'season', 'Instead', 'was', 'disregarded', 'big', 'budget', 'mediocrity', 'Gangs', 'New', ""York'.Sad"", 'very', 'sad.', 'Rabbit-Proof', 'Fence', 'true', 'story', 'young', 'Molly', 'sister', 'Daisy', 'cousin', 'Gracie', 'escape', 'training', 'camp', 'Australia', 'year', '1931', 'years', '1905', '1971', 'HUGE', 'time', 'span', 'law', 'Australia', 'allowed', 'white', 'settlers', 'basically', 'kidnap', 'half-castle', 'children', 'half', 'white/half', 'aboriginal', 'place', 'camps', 'where', 'were', 'integrated', 'white', 'society', 'purpose', 'camps', 'was', 'basically', 'stamp', 'out', 'race', 'forcing', 'young', 'children', 'mate', 'whites', 'order', 'phase', 'out', 'race', 'Molly', 'Daisy', 'Gracie', 'were', 'stripped', 'homes', 'brought', 'one', 'camps.But', 'escaped.After', 'fleeing', 'brutal', 'new', 'home', 'three', 'girls', 'made', '1,500', 'mile', 'trek', 'rabbit-proof', 'fence', 'back', 'homes', 'covering', 'desert', 'nine', 'months', 'grueling', 'dangerous', 'journey', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'heartwarming', 'uplifting', 'stories', 'put', 'screen.Adapted', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'was', 'actually', 'written', 'Molly', 'very', 'own', 'daughter', 'Doris', 'Pilkington', 'Garimara', 'beautiful', 'film', 'bound', 'touch', 'heart', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'especially', 'three', 'young', 'girls', 'Everlyn', 'Sampi', 'Tianna', 'Sansbury', 'Laura', 'Monaghan', 'are', 'outstanding', 'very', 'raw', 'real', 'Everlyn', 'Sampi', 'especially', 'film', 'such', 'honesty', 'was', 'amazed', 'beautiful', 'performance', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'yes', 'THAT', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'brilliantly', 'used', 'enforcer', 'camp', 'steely', 'gaze', 'subtle', 'evil', 'never', 'respectfully', 'can', 'call', 'man', 'wrong', 'ways', 'honesty', 'realism.', 'Rabbit-Proof', 'Fence', 'film', 'subject', 'racism', 'way', 'will', 'make', 'real', 'issue', 'Instead', 'tacking', 'slew', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'row', 'calling', 'provocative', 'Crash', 'film', 'subtle', 'yet', 'harrowing', 'approach', 'give', 'validity', 'horrible', 'atrocity', 'film', 'racism', 'real', 'viewer', 'awareness', 'disease.This', 'brilliant', 'film', 'everyone', 'should', 'make', 'point', 'see']",Rabbit-Proof Fence

'Rabbit-Proof Fence' tells the amazing, true-life saga of three young Aboriginal girls, kidnapped by the Australian government as part of a terribly misguided forced resettlement program.  These three girls are reflective of what Australians now call the 'lost generation.' The policy is now universally seen as a colossal blunder in this proud nation's history.In the Australian and EU marketing campaigns, we know exactly what the movie brings: it features a stirring image of two of the girls - Everlyn Sampi and Tianna Sansbury - obviously struggling through the Outback, fence on their right, foreboding sky in the background.  In short, a succinct and indelible image of what the film is about.So, how is US release marketed?  With a huge picture of Kenneth Branagh, in 'hero pose' no less, eyes scanning the horizon with intent purpose.  Which would be fine if (a) Branagh was the star, and (b) he was the hero.Much to the contrary, Branagh is the movie's villian.  In fact, he is the villian to such an extent that he's referred to in the film as ""Mr Devil.""This is how you decide to market the movie?  Pathetic.It's a shame, too, because 'Fence' itself is a wonderful movie, both stirring and educational.  Even better is the ""Making of..."" DVD extra, which centers on Director Phillip Noyce's efforts to find and cast his three young stars.  You will be left open-mouthed at the magnetism of the oldest of the selected trio, Everlyn Sampi.

Painful, but a story that should be told, and told as well as in this movie.The three young aborigine girls are forcibly removed from their village and taken off to a kind of boarding school to make them discard their culture and language.

The three young girls do a fine job in these demanding roles, though sometimes it's difficult to hear the spoken lines.

Marold""","[0, 0]","Our professor of theology shows this film, in its entirety, to her classes on ""Theology from the Underside"" about those who preach for the oppressed peoples of the world. One must make a double-take to recognize that the events in the film took place in the middle of the 20th century, and not 200 or more years ago.I'm loathe to say anything about the story in advance, to lessen the impact in any way. There is only one name actor, Kenneth Branagh, in a role where you have to check the credits to verify that it is in fact the famous interpreter of Shakespeare. There is inevitably controversy over the degree to which the villains are painted as too villainous and the heroes are too heroic. But that does not take away from the power of the film, which, in spite of a total absence of flashy CGI and power actors, the story is heart wrenching. One almost wants to believe that things were not as bad as the film makes them out to be, in order to dull the pain. In fact, things may have been worse. While the automobiles signal the '30's, the policies of Australia did not change, eliminating the policies carried out on the screen, until the 1970's. This era created ""The Stolen Generation"" which, if you read it from the Australian government at the time, makes perfect sense. Seen from the point of view of the aborigines, it was cruelty of the worst kind.One can be happy that the practices depicted in this film have come to an end.

598270,A2BIK37ZMXKW91,B00005JLD4,"brian komyathy ""Thanks for scouting out my pa...","[71, 82]","This rather well made & enjoyable Australian film is billed as a true story.  We are shown an individual, half-caste, Aborigine girl by the name of Molly Craig as she is forceably taken from her mother and thence to a place called Moore River to be brought up amongst whites.  All the children at Moore River, we are led to believe, have similarly been remanded here for their own good and against their and/or their parents' will; the director all the while conveying the view that---in this manner---the Australian government went about trying to extiguish Aborigine culture, by removing half-caste (ie., those with one white parent) Aborigine children from their families to be brought up as white.  The focus of this film concerns a young girl (named Molly) as she walks over a thousand miles back to her mother, after she escapes (with her 2 sisters) from Moore River.  The guardian of that institution (played by Kenneth Branagh) is portrayed as one determined to locate these girls and have them forceably brought back for their own good.  It's a remarkable story actually---the girl Molly did in fact walk over a thousand miles! back to her mother & home in the 1930s (by following a low ""rabbit proof fence"" through western Austalia.  The real Molly Craig, when viewing this film, however, declared ""This is not my story.""  She wasn't actually taken by force, for instance.  Her step-father even consented to her being sent to Moore River.  Moreover, the 1936 Royal Commission into treatment of Aborigines showed that 1,003 of Moore River's 1,067 children weren't ""stolen"" but voluntarily brought by their parents to get a schooling or be safe ; for their own good (as half-castes were sometimes harrassed and/or shunned by other Aborigines).  Read all the details yourself from the Australian Civil Liberties Union at this address: ([...]) To boot, the illiterate girl who portrayed Molly Craig in this film herself ran away from the making of this picture; not once, but twice!  And after the film was completed she was then sent to boarding school by the director (yes she was brought back twice too, to complete the film) until she decared she didn't want to be there either; wanting simply to go home---a desire she was ultimately granted.  The director declared that he was only trying to help her---notwithstanding the film's Kenneth Branagh character saying the same thing in the film while being presented as a racist.  Mind you, I LIKED THE FILM.  It was well shot.  The children actors were very believable.  The Australian landscapes involved herein were captured to great effect too.  The problem is---after reading up on this for several hours on the internet---I know not what's true and what isn't concerning the story of Aborigines in Australia; except that the director of this film apparently took an awful lot of liberties with the story on which he based Rabbit Proof Fence.  That the director had the audacity to put a photo of the real Molly Craig at the end of the film, too, inclines me to not recommend this film.  But I won't go that far since I actually liked the film.  Instead, let me suggest that you not take all you see and hear in this film as necessarily part of the notion that ""This is a true story.""  And should you decide to give this film a try do at least have  a look at the article I've indicated above.  Thanks for reading my thoughts herein & I hope you take them in the spirit in which they were offered; honestly, I find it hard to understand why folks wouldn't want more information when it's rather pertinent, I think.

The movie is a must see for everyone to truly understand what the Australian Government did to assimilate and transform the traditions and religious beliefs of the Aborigine culture.  To begin with in 1770 the British established a penal colony on the eastern half of the country and over time many colonist formed families with the Aboriginal people and over the next 130 years changed the ethnicity of the country.  The movie transports you to 1931 when the City of Victoria Australia was enforcing the Aboriginal Protection Act which developed and maintained controls over where the Aboriginals could live, work and who they could marry.  They even passed an Act known as the Half-Caste Act which removed children of Aboriginal people that were mixed with the colonist.  The Chief Protector of the Aboriginal people was a man named A.O. Neville who was in charge of enforcing the Half-Caste Act.  In the movie three girls named Molly (Evelyn Sampi) age 14, her younger sister Daisy (Tianna Sansbury) and Gracie (Laura Monaghan) their cousin were removed against their will and family and taken over 1200 miles to a religious based boarding school named Moore River Native Settlement in Perth.  Moore River was designed to educate the Half-Caste children into the white world and train them to be servants and marry white men.  The goal was to breed the Aboriginal ethnicity out of them over time. This movie becomes an adventure when Molly finds the courage to take her sister and cousin and escape Moore River to get home.  Just imagine yourself as a young teenage girl having to walk or run 1200 miles to get home.  That is the distance between New York City and Tampa Florida.  Not knowing what roads or trails to take they followed a fence that divided Australia into sections from west to east and north to south.  The fence was referred to as the Rabbit Proof Fence and they followed it home to Jigalong Station.  They endured rain, sweltering heat and hunger while knowing they were being tracked by an experienced Aboriginal tracker and The Chief Protector's men whose goal was to return them to the Moore River Settlement.

In this movie, however, the racism is portrayed as a ""gentle"" sort of racism where half caste girls are being isolated and educated for their own good, noblesse oblige at its finest (or at its worst).  One striking point in the movie was when the administrator shows a number of slides where aborigines become more and more white, as succeeding generations intermarry more and more with whites.This was a very painful movie to watch.  I could imagine the three girls wondering what they did wrong to be taken from their homes and from their parents to what could only seem to them to be a prison.  The arrogance of the administrator was very difficult to watch also.  He seemed to believe the clich&eacute;s that he was tossing about regarding the simplicity of these people, and their need to come under the white man's beneficence.  But in today's world he appears more like a slavemaster.The aborigines are portrayed as slaves.  The tracker was obliged to stay at the camp or lose his daughter.

598279,A3BEF4IHWI0VC,B00005JLD4,Chris Luallen,"[5, 5]","This movie tells the story of three aborginal children who were kidnapped from their mother and taken to a faraway school in order to be indoctrinated into white Australian culture. This was the policy of the Australian government towards ""half-caste"" children, meaning those born with one parent who was white and one who was aborginal. In some ways it was similar to how the United States built schools intended to assimilate American Indians into mainstream white society.The rest of the movie depicts how the three kids escape and then, with tremendous bravery and determination, make a 1,500 mile journey on foot to home. It's an extraordinary story that covers an important aspect of Australian history that remains unknown to many people. So, on that level, I enjoyed the movie.But what keeps it from reaching the highest level of cinema is that the movie is basically a simplistic ""morality tale"" with very little nuance or subtly. Of course, the three girls are inherently heroic. But I would have preferred that the rest of the cast were portrayed with greater depth and a wider diversity of perspectives. Instead almost all the white Australians are depicted as simplistic villans, with a few bad ""sell-out"" aborigines thrown in for good measure.History teaches us that the interaction of cultures involves a complex dynamic with a wide diversity of personalities and both sides generally attempting to do what is in their own self-interest. This holds true even when one side is clearly more powerful and therefore able to generally dominate and victimize the other, as was the case between whites and aborigines in Australia.I still consider this a movie worth seeing.

J Millett ""movie critic and buff""","[2, 3]","In a time where movie producers are continuously trying to one-up each other with bigger-and-badder CGI spectacles, watching a film like this is refreshing. Completely stripped of pretension, prettiness, and unneccasary dribble, it is a story that speaks directly to the heart. Director Phillip Noyce (The Quiet American) and D.P. Christopher Doyle give us a vast and seemingly endless Australian desert landscape. In tune with the wonderfully placid score by Peter Gabriel, the results are hypnotic and compelling. There are stretches where very few lines of dialogue are spoken. The camera simply places these three young girls in the harshest reaches of the desert terrain, and we understand, if only slightly, what the real experience must have been like.The film tells a simple story of what it means to feel secure as a child and be with family. It also explores the effects of an age old racial stereotype that was then policy of the Australian government; Blacks must integrate and adjust to white society. And worse, Blacks are not able to raise their own children. It works because it does not trap itself inside a fixed and conventional narrative. Noyce explores his themes well, without throwing them in our faces as so many films regrettably do. We as the viewers are immersed into the journey across 1,500 miles of unforgiving desert, as the young girls try to outmaneuver the men sent to recapture them.This is a beautiful film in its ability to captivate and move us in unexpected ways. The last few shots show us the two surviving sisters, now old and weak, and we hear Molly in voice-over tell us how their family is still being ruined by racial prejudice. We sympathize with them, of course. But we notice they are smiling, unwavering in their optimism and love of life. They lost a sister on their journey back home, and Molly lost her daughter for good.

The film, based off the novel of the same name written by real life daughter to Molly Craig, Doris Pilkington Garimara, chronicles their capture and escape in brutal detail and puts you in their shoes.  A little background info for you, in the years between 1905-1971 the white settlers in Australia enforced a law that allowed all half-caste children (that's half aboriginal and half white) to be taken from their homes and brought to camps where they would be assimilated into white society.  The purpose was to stamp out the race.  They wanted these children to mate with other white men, and their children to mate with whites and so on and so forth until any traces of aboriginal desendence would be gone.  Kenneth Branagh (who resembles Ewan McGregor) plays the enforcer and owner of all aboriginies (it's explained in the outset of the film) and thus he's the villian sort-a-speak.  After the girls are uprooted from their home and placed in the camp they decide to escape, and escape they do.  The rest of the film follows them as they trek for 9 months through the Australian desert, following the rabbit-proof fence, a 1,500-mile fence separating outback desert from the farmlands of Western Australia.  There journey is a heartwrenching, heartwarming story of their desire and need to be who they are.  What is so important about this film is that at times we only see racism in this country, which to be brutally honest is the [...] of too many jokes, and so to see how others were treated sheds light on the subject and hopefully will help others see a need, maybe even in our own homes.  It's crazy how we, as Americans, know of racism, know of slavery...we're taught it in schools and reminded of it everytime we see shows like 'Black/White' and at times it's shows like that that make racism seem more like a joke then a reality, but while watching this film my wife and I started talking and you really start to see what racism really is and that it is a serious problem.  To hear the men in this movie talk about their beliefs and how they feel they are helping these people by in an essence 'making' them white is horrible.  I mean, they really thought they were doing a good thing.  The courage these young girls showed was amazing.

O. Neville (Kenneth Branagh) that the Aborigine ""in spite of himself, the native must be helped."" Doris Pilkington in 1996 wrote ""Follow the Rabbit-Proof Fence"" about the abduction of Molly (Everlyn Sampi), her younger sister Daisy (Tianna Sansbury) and cousin Grace (Laura Monaghan) from their backward and illiterate surroundings. Their mother can offer them a loving home, but the government's educational facility can prepare them to participate more fully in the advanced world of the 20th Century. Director Phillip Noyce does not make the mistake and demonize Neville. The man's heart is truly in the right place. Neville is a racist who adheres to the pseudoscientific theories popular during that era. Surprisingly, his racism is not of the segregationist variety. Neville truly desires full integration of the Aborigine into Australian society. He realizes, quite accurately, that the future prospects of these children will dramatically improve if they become westernized. Regretfully, Neville fails to realize that he has no right to force assimilation upon these Aborigine families. The girls escape from the school and must travel over a thousand miles to return to the land of their ancestors. Neville will not rest until they are safely back in custody. The story revolves around their courageous high risk adventure in avoiding capture and surviving the brutal outback environment. The incredibly beautiful music of Peter Gabriel conveys the inner turmoil of both the benevolent dictators and their innocent and uncomprehending prey. Isn't some sort of compromise possible? Is there anyway of reaching a win-win result?The new world is unrelentingly clashing with that of the old---and Western Civilization as defined by Matthew Arnold must ultimately prevail. The values of the West are nothing more than the championing of the best that has ever been said and written in human history. Race, ethnicity, and religion are not relevant factors. People of Caucasian pigmentation do not inherently have a monopoly on the truth. ""Follow the Rabbit-Proof Fence"" is a beautiful film dealing with the awkward issues surrounding the assimilation of the uninitiated into Western society. We are reminded that the so-called natives still have rights that cannot be ruthlessly ignored. The imposition of the minimal values underpinning a viable social order is warranted. After that, only the process of political and social conversion is acceptable. There is also no reason whatsoever to abandon the valid traditions of the indigenous culture.

They literally tore away children from their parents and although there was no indication in the film that they were mistreated horribly, it is still inhumane.  But in every human tragedy, a person will rise up to challenge the status quo.  The girl named Molly led her younger sister Daisy, and cousin Gracie through the desert, eluding capture by a trained tracker, until Gracie is fooled by the promise of meeting her mother a train station.  For months, nobody could find Molly and Daisy.  It's a testament to human survival.

One has to applaud Phillip Noyce for taking on the project, for the story of the multi-generational theft of half-Aboriginal children is not a proud chapter in Australia's history. The fervor with which so many people still defend the intent, if not the actual text, of the Aborigines Protection Act (which, among other things, allowed half-caste children to be forcibly removed from their parents without any justification) simply proves how shameful it was. Denial is a powerful substitute for guilt.In making this film, Noyce had a monumental job ahead of him. He had to work with untrained child actors, pay heed to historical accuracy, and generate sympathy without slipping into cliches--all of which he accomplished with the aid of some stunning cinematography and a haunting soundtrack by Peter Gabriel. Noyce,  unwittingly, also ended up having to educate the children in their own sad history. (As one of the cast so poignantly put it, they ""lost their innocence"" during the filming.) Although a lot of controversy surrounds the ""Stolen Generations,"" if there is any doubt in anyone's mind that the theft of these children was anything less than a tragedy, watch the Special Features. During the scene in which the children are carried away, the actresses playing the mothers could not stop crying. They huddled in a group and wailed until their ""stolen children"" were brought back to them.

598300,A17IW44FV0HUTY,B00005JLD4,Glen Engel Cox,"[4, 7]","We've been trying to see this film for a while now, after having missed it in the theater. I was interested because it had a score by Peter Gabriel, who has great taste for movies with which to lend his efforts (e.g., Birdy, The Last Tempation of Christ). It also had Kenneth Branagh in it, whom I don't follow as much as I used to given his recent track record, but when he's good, he's very good. And in this movie, playing the part of Mr. Neville, the ""Aborigine Protector"" of Australia for 25 years, he shines. There's nothing more unctuous than a man who thinks he is doing the right and noble thing, which we can view in hindsight as a truly horrible policy.The story is set in 1931 during the Australian relocation of half-caste children to an orphanage that tried to instill white culture and identity on them. The three girls that the story follows are taken from their home and transported to the Moore House 1200 miles away, then run away to make their way back home by walking, mostly using the rabbit-proof fence as a guide. The director doesn't attempt to explain much beyond the initial subtitles that set the time and scene; in fact, in some scenes, his ""show"" has to be interpreted, albeit it is usually obvious enough (such as the white man visiting the half-caste cleaning woman on his farm in the middle of the night). Branagh's Neville is a central focus, ostensibly the villain of the movie, but he comes across as simply a bureaucrat with no empathy for the aborigines that he is supposed to be the protector of. The scene in which he explains his goal of breeding the color out of the half-castes makes clear that his protectorship was more oriented to the whites than the aborigines.One finishes the movie simply shaking your head in disbelief. It's hard to conceive walking 1200 miles (or more, given the wrong turns and need to avoid capture) across the Australian outback without dying of hunger or thirst or simply getting lost. And it's hard to believe in a people that would engage in such practice of separating mother from child, as recently as 1970. As Americans we can't be too critical of the Australians, however, because our actions with our own indigenous people were hardly noble or just and just occured a few decades before the Austrialian debacle.I enjoyed Rabbit-Proof Fence, although I'm not sure I'd recommend it to just anyone.

Neville, Chief Protector of Aborigines in Western Australia at the beginning of the twentieth century.  The film depicts three young girls, who after being removed from their mother to a training school 1,500 miles away, escape and make the long journey back, helped by a long fence used to protect farmland from the ravages of Australia's rabbit population.  The film is solidly based on fact, drawing from a book written by the lone surviving daughter of one of the three girls. Despite contemporary sensibilities to this grim policy once viewed as one of enlightened benevolence, the movie itself is not heavy-handed in moralistic overtones, but rather focuses on the ingenuity of the three girls in eluding their Aboriginal tracker (skillfully played by David Gulpilil). In an extraordinarily powerful climax, we actually see cameo appearances by two of three survivors of this epic journey at the end of the movie, seventy years after their feat in the Western Australian outback.

598303,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00005JLD4,Grady Harp,"[1, 4]","Director Phillip Noyce has succeeded in creating a cinematic version of the true book about the 'racial cleansing' of the Australian Aborigines that took part in the first half of the 20th Century.  The Australian government subsidized campsites to where half caste Aboriginal girls would be sent to breed with white men and thus diminish the ethnic qualities of the 'backward natives'. In three genrations the half castes could produce dilution of the 'blackness' of their people by creating half castes > camaroons > octaroons who would have at least the physical characteristics of whites.  This horid bit of history is brought to light by director Noyce in a sophisticated, straight forward, very tender rendering of the escape of three sisters by following the course of the rabbit-proof fence extending from their displacemnet camp in Northern Australia to their home 1500 miles to the South.  Most of the film dwells on the odyssey of Molly, Gracie, and Daisy as they stalwartly defy desert, hunger, fear and the trackers to reach their home.  Noyce wisely uses three inordinately fine young  Aboriginal girls to play the key roles. The evil incarnate Kenneth Branaugh summarizes the Australian government plan, and the remainder of the cast is uniformly excellent.  Photographed in a tone that suggests the bleak wildness of the Australian desert, this little film is a monument to the indefatigable spirit and soul of the Aborigines, and as such this film stands as an important document in the studies about human rights.

Rabbit-Proof Fence is the certainly the best Australian film I have ever seen and one of the finest films yet from this young decade.  Why?  It's story is real, poignant, and thoroughly entertaining; I never once looked at the clock.  And its heart-tugging without being sappy or overly politically correct; like the Quebecois film &quot;Robe Noir&quot;, one sees that neither side is completely in the right (unless you think its OK to sleep in the dirt, eat lizards, and have no formal education).  The film is visually stunning with brilliant colors and superb wide screen cinematography.  And the acting, in my humble opinion, puts this film over the top.  Kenneth Brannaugh redeems his downwardly spiraling career with a performance that will some day be held up just underneath his Henry V as his most compelling role.  But even more importantly, Everlyn Sampi's quiet but powerful performance should someday be held up with Maria Falconetti's Jeanne d'Arc as one of the most memorable events in the history of film.  She was stunning.  David Gulpilil's role as the tracker was also great.  It gave that &quot;uuuuuuu&quot; scary feel that I remember from reading Mark Twain novels as a kid.  All of this makes for a great family-film introduction to serious topics.I thought the DVD image and the &quot;making of&quot; extra documentary were thoroughly entertaining.  I was also fascinated with how beautiful all those young Aboriginal children were.  In all my life I have never scene an attractive Aboriginal person on TV or film, and here I see that there are bounds of them.  This film was largely ignored by the US market and awards, but that means little.  A look at the long list of best-picture winning Oscars shows a long line of mostly forgotten and unimportant films.

These regulations allowed the Australian government to abduct any half-castes (mix-breed, Aboriginal/Caucasion) and relocate them into camps, not only to force western culture, religion and language upon them, but also to prevent them from mating with full-blood aboriginals in order to cleanse the aboriginal culture into non-existence.  Trust me, you won't believe it, even after you see it.Technically, Rabbit-Proof Fence is a chase movie, utilizing many of the Hollywood conventions of close-calls, miscues, and a soundscape that adds to the tensions tenfold.  The film is also so much more, especially emotionally, with wonderfully developed characters (this is often over-looked in Hollywood chase movies).The three half-caste girls (Sampi, Sansbury and Monaghan) give some of the most natural child performances in cinema, especially considering that during a majority of the film they only have each other to play off of.  They truly give the film a natural, honest, documentary feel which adds so much to the emotional impact.  Branagh, though not very ""natural"", brilliantly portrays the man behind the cleansing scheme, a man that could quite easily hang with Hitler and hold his own in conversations about the ways and means to white supremecy.Its so nice to see something this fresh and touching, a film that doesn't come up roses in the end, but still leaves with much hope and heart.

For those interested in making a movie based on true expierences and hsitorical events, then watch this piece of work that is artistically compelling and both emotionally draining and uplifting.To often, movies based on true events take too many liberities with a astory that both history and the essence of the events are missed and often, what develops is an artistic vision that bares little resemblance to the &quot;real thing.&quot; (Think of The Untouchables or Nixon) This cheats the viewers who wish to connect with people of the past.  Noyce avoids all this by hiring actors like Kenneth Branaugh who turn in a perfect performance and childern to act who are not professionally trained, but come from the backgroud of the people he wishes to portray.The story is about Molly Craig, a 14 year &quot;half-caste&quot; who is taken from her mother to be inculcated into the &quot;white system&quot; of Austriala's government.  She is abducted with her sister and cousain.  The cousian, Gracie, ends up being recaptured by the police, but Molly and her sister triumphantly return home.This movie is so well done, that knowing the plot before hand does not discourage the viewer.

Along with her eight year old sister and ten year old cousin they break free of the cages, both figurative and literal, to embark on an arduous journey back to family, back to home.  Because of a eugenics based government policy in Australia, all half-caste Aboriginal children were to be taken from their parents and sent to schools.  For nearly 70 years this policy attempted to educated and breed out the blackness of half-castes.Based on a book written by the actual daughter of Molly, this film is primarily about the three month struggle endured by the trio of little girls as they followed a rabbit-proof fence home through the sometimes very unforgiving outback landscape.  Along the way they bond, survive, and avoid the various efforts of the ""Chief Protector of the Aborigines,"" A.O. Neville (Kenneth Branaugh), and the tracker who is always one step behind the ingenious little girls.All of the leads were wonderfully real, and had the filming been done differently I could have been convinced that this was a documentary instead of a film.  Those playing Aborigine roles displayed a wide range of emotions, and truly appeared affected by all that transpired.  Branaugh, on the other hand, acted with the quiet reserve of a man who is powerful without being overbearing, a man who believes in the misguided policies of previous generations.  The pacing and directing is purposeful; it's slow, deliberate, and effective.  At no time does tedium become an issue, despite the lack of action.  Attention is demanded by the story's power and historical relevancy.This story and movie would be a wonderful supplement to any history teacher's curriculum, and it should be mandatory viewing for Australian students.  If I had to compare the power of this movie, my immediate thoughts are ofThe Power of One.

C Clark ""eanna""","[0, 0]","Rabbit-Proof Fence is a film with a very simple message, vividly, repeatedly, and wholeheartedly reiterated: the policy of forcibly removing mixed-race aboriginal children from their mothers and educating them in government schools was wrong. Well-meaning, possibly. Probably not vicious or vilely racist (at least as presented in the film). But certainly wrong. The implementers certainly thought they were doing what was best, both for the children and the overwhelmingly white civilization by forcing them to join the Twentieth Century.There are innumerable overlooked wrongs in the past. Enough to keep Hollywood (and all the foreign subsidiaries) busy for many years, and as long as the white characters get portrayed as the villains, there will be a ready market for such films among the American liberal populace.But breaking up families is what was wrong with this policy, and it is what those same American liberals are doing today. All their policies, so cherished and cheered at conventions, diminish the family. Whether it is abortion on demand, abortion without parental consent, state supervision and control of every aspect of a child's life, compulsory schooling--in public schools with no alternative, easy to get divorce, and on and on, the contemporary elite has shafted the family as assuredly as those long dead Australian bureaucrats did.

598321,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B00005JLD4,Joe Sherry,"[3, 3]","One word: Incredible.  I don't remember this movie getting much press when it was released, but it should have.  This is a top 10 movie for 2002 in my eyes.  Rabbit-Proof Fence was directed by Philip Noyce (The Quiet American) and is set in 1930's Australia.  Australia had a policy regarding the Aborignal natives.  A child born of an aboriginal parent and white parent was known as being half-caste.  The government would not allow these children to be raised in their aboriginal families and they were taken away.  Rabbit-Proof Fence follows three girls who were taken from their village and relocated 1200 miles away.  Before I forget to mention it, this is a true story and is based on a book written by the daughters of one of these girls.The film follows Molly, Daisy, and Gracie: three children whose ages range from 8-14.  They are ripped from the arms of their mothers (literally) and taken to the reform school more than a thousand miles away (as far away as New York is from California).  The school tries to strip them of their culture.  They are introduced to Christianity (as a Christian I feel the religion is true and is a good thing, but it should be a choice not forced upon somebody), can only speak English and they are introduced to an entirely new lifestyle.  This is inter-cut with the director of this program giving a lecture on why the half-caste children are a real threat and why they should be taken care of and eventually have the black bred out of them.  Kenneth Branagh plays this man, and while he is the villain, he honestly believes that he is doing right and that he is doing the right thing by the half-caste children.  By no means is he a sympathetic character, but we see that he is misguided and mistaken instead of evil.  He truly believes that the school is the best place for the children.  We also see a scene of a runaway being brought back in.  No runaway had ever escaped for long.Molly leads Gracie and Daisy to escape.  Most of the movie is of the trek back to their home and evading the tracker (extremely skilled).  They are aided at times by white and black citizens and aboriginals, some knowing exactly where these children came from.  It is an incredible journey and if it wasn't a true story I'm not sure I would have believed it was possible.  At the very end of the film we see a shot of Molly and Gracie as old women.  They are walking together.  That was a beautiful shot and even knowing that this was true, that shot makes it hit home.  These are the women that escaped as children.

Neville (Kenneth Branagh) is the government pencil-pusher empowered to ""protect"" the native aboriginals, part of which policy is to forcibly remove half-caste children from their native homes and send them to special schools where they can be ""improved"" by the ways and language of the whites. Rather than being a cruel or bad man, Neville is a well-intentioned and paternalistic bureaucrat whose working theory of racial superiority is at the benevolent end of the spectrum, the other end being the extermination camps of Hitler's Third Reich. As Neville puts it, ""The native must be helped in spite of himself.""Three children abducted from their home under this program are Molly (14), her sister Daisy (8), and cousin Gracie (10). They're transported to a school 1,200 miles away. Very soon after arriving, Molly decides to escape and walk back home. She convinces Daisy and Gracie to accompany her. The trek back is along the RABBIT-PROOF FENCE, a wire mesh barrier thousands of miles long stretching from the north to southern coasts of Western Australia, and which was designed to keep wild rabbits from devastating the crop lands.The three aboriginal children who play the roles of Molly, Daisy and Gracie (Everlyn Sampi, Tianna Sansbury, and Laura Monaghan respectively) are untrained actors, but you wouldn't know it by the performances they give. Molly is especially impressive as the one whose strength must keep her companions moving forward on the long march, as well as provide the cunning and skill to avoid both the roving constables on the lookout and the old aboriginal tracker, Moodoo (David Gulpilil), used by the school to hunt down runaways.RABBIT-PROOF FENCE is based on a true story, a fact brought home to the audience by the film's last scene.  It's an amazing and moving tribute to the pluck of three children determined to foil the foolish and insensitive policy of a misguided government.

598333,A18Y3VRG7OP4J2,B00005JLD4,Kim F.,"[31, 33]","Rabbit-Proof Fence is an amazing movie based on a dark period in Australia's history. Half-caste children are taken from their Aborigine mothers and raised in camps, with the goal of helping them make the transition from their ""primitive"" lifestyle to the white world. Although the camps are not horrible, the fact that the children/families have no choice is.3 girls defy the system and escape. Their plan is to follow the rabbit-proof fence (that's being/been built across Australia) to get back to their home - 1200 miles away! The girls range from 8 to 14 years old. They find some help along the way but it's primarily their will to get back home that gets them through. What makes this even more amazing is that it really happened! In fact, the 14 year old made the trip twice after being returned to the camp after her first successful escape.The movie avoids preaching about the wrongness of the Aborigine Act but, instead, focuses on showing the various sides of the story - the whites who honestly feel that they are helping the children, the whites along the way who help the girls even knowing that they have escaped, the Aborigine tracker who can't seem to find the girls despite his skills, and, of course, the children and families impacted.Rabbit-Proof Fence reminded me of the Railway Children in the US - another story that should be told!",5,A must-see film!,1041984000,"01 8, 2003",2003,1357,"['Rabbit-Proof', 'Fence', 'amazing', 'movie', 'based', 'dark', 'period', 'Australia', 'history', 'Half-caste', 'children', 'are', 'taken', 'Aborigine', 'mothers', 'raised', 'camps', 'goal', 'helping', 'make', 'transition', 'primitive', 'lifestyle', 'white', 'world', 'camps', 'are', 'not', 'horrible', 'fact', 'children/families', 'have', 'choice', 'is.3', 'girls', 'defy', 'system', 'escape', 'plan', 'follow', 'rabbit-proof', 'fence', 'being/been', 'built', 'Australia', 'get', 'back', 'home', '1200', 'miles', 'away', 'girls', 'range', '8', '14', 'years', 'old', 'find', 'help', 'way', 'primarily', 'will', 'get', 'back', 'home', 'What', 'even', 'more', 'amazing', 'really', 'happened', 'fact', '14', 'year', 'old', 'made', 'trip', 'twice', 'being', 'returned', 'camp', 'first', 'successful', 'escape.The', 'movie', 'avoids', 'preaching', 'wrongness', 'Aborigine', 'Act', 'instead', 'focuses', 'showing', 'various', 'sides', 'story', 'whites', 'who', 'honestly', 'feel', 'are', 'helping', 'children', 'whites', 'way', 'who', 'help', 'girls', 'even', 'knowing', 'have', 'escaped', 'Aborigine', 'tracker', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'find', 'girls', 'skills', 'course', 'children', 'families', 'impacted.Rabbit-Proof', 'Fence', 'reminded', 'Railway', 'Children', 'US', 'story', 'should', 'be', 'told']",Rabbit-Proof Fence
598334,A2GPEV42IO41CI,B00005JLD4,Kona,"[1, 1]","Rabbit-Proof Fence is a remarkable story of brutal racism and the courage of three children.  Until as recently as 1970, Australia's harsh policy toward its aboriginal people allowed for the forcible capture of half-white children and their relocation in concentration-camp-like centers, for the purpose of training them to be domestic servants in white society.  This film tells the true story of three such girls who escaped from the center in 1932, and walked 1500 miles back to their family.  Their only marker, across the desolate desert and bush, was the world's longest fence, the ""rabbit-proof fence,"" which eventually led them home.This story of Australia's misguided attempt to help the aborigines ""in spite of themselves"" has an excellent script and direction.  The children, all non-actors, are wonderfully convincing and sympathetic.  Kenneth Branagh has a small role as the government official who tries to recapture the girls.  He is a by-the-books, no-nonsense man who believes he is really helping the people whose lives he decimates.  David Gulpilil plays the aboriginal tracker who relentlessly follows the girls, and his villainous character was truly frightening.  The sweeping photography of the arid outback shows just how tremendous the girls' accomplishment was.

598335,A1WTYALNQNQG99,B00005JLD4,Larry L. Looney,"[1, 1]","Director Phillip Noyce, who has several notably successful films - both `artistically' and `commercially' - to his credit, has given viewers something very special indeed in this effort.  RABBIT-PROOF FENCE is moving and absorbing, and goes a long way in illustrating to the world the injustices that have been done to indigenous peoples - NOT just the Aborigines in Australia - in the name of `doing what is best for them'.  In attempting to impose what they think is best, colonizers from time immemorial have shattered and destroyed millions of families and lives - their arrogance has trampled on the souls of so many.  Facing up to this is the first step in righting wrongs, and - hopefully - in preventing their recurrence.  A novel I read recently - FUGITIVE PIECES, by Anne Michaels - summed it up nicely:  `History is the poisoned well, seeping into the groundwater.  It is not the unknown past we're doomed to repeat, but the past we know.'  In other words - learning about the mistakes of the past is all well and good, but if we don't learn FROM these mistakes, we have accomplished nothing.This film is based on a book that chronicles the true story of three young girls on a perilous and courageous journey across 1500 miles of Outback terrain - terrain that is unforgiving as only that in Australia can be.  Ripped from their families by `well-meaning' government policies designed to civilize and train `half-caste' children (children born of mixed blood) and assimilate them back into white society, `breeding out the Black' over the course of 2-3 generations, the girls (ranging in age from 7 to 14) are traumatized beyond belief.  The strength and heart they show is moving and inspiring - if children can rise up and stand against the odds thrown against these three, we can accomplish anything.  The children who were thus `removed to government care' came to be known as `the stolen generations'.Noyce was moved by the story itself - in the form of a screenplay presented to him - to make this film.  With successes in the past with such works as THE QUIET AMERICAN, THE BONE COLLECTOR, and two Harrison Ford box-office smashes, PATRIOT GAMES and CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER, he had the reputation to make this film happen - and it's a treasure.  I'll agree wholeheartedly with another reviewer below - the accompanying documentary on the making of the film, in which we can see the process used to find the three children to portray the main roles (the girls chosen had never acted before) is fascinating.  One part of the documentary shows the filming of the scene in which the girls are taken by government agents, literally torn from their mothers' arms - even knowing it was `only a scene in a film', when it was over there were tears in the eyes of not just the actors, but the director and film crew as well.  This is VERY moving subject matter - and it translates to the screen incredibly well, without ever lapsing into maudlin sentimentality.Aside from the three girls (Everlyn Sampi, Tianna Sansbury and Laura Monaghan), everyone else in the cast does a nice job as well.  Kenneth Branagh does a fine, understated turn as A.O.Neville, the government official charged with `protecting' the Aboriginal peoples in his region.  Notable also is the well-known Aboriginal actor David Gulpilil - veteran of such classics as Peter Weir' THE LAST WAVE and Nicolas Roeg's WALKABOUT).  His presence is electrifying, as always - his portrayal of Moodoo the Tracker is successful on many levels, allowing him to illustrate how hard it was for an Aborigine to be `in the service' of the white man's government.  Moodoo's own daughter is a pupil at the government-run school where the three girls have been placed - so, while his loyalties to the government lead him to track the runaways, he is able to feel sympathy for their plight at the same time, admiring their skills and (I suspect) secretly hoping that they will elude him.With all of these components adding up to a fine piece of filmmaking, I can't neglect to mention the amazing soundtrack music, composed and performed by Peter Gabriel.  He has taken the story into his heart and provided the viewer with nothing less than the spirit of the girls, their ordeal, story and courage, in musical form.  Incorporating many elements of Aboriginal music into his work makes it more powerful still - it's an important element that makes an outstanding contribution to the overall effect of the film.There is violence in this film - both overt and psychological - but it is a violence that is an intrinsic part of the story.  There is no nudity that I remember - if it was present, it was so much a part of the lives depicted that it flowed naturally into the scheme of things.  There is only a hint of sexuality.  How in the world can a film be successful without sex, nudity, senseless violence, foul language and drugs?  This one does it - by taking a moving story (never forget:  taken from life) and painting it carefully, honestly and with great feeling onto the screen.  This is a film that should be seen by everyone - don't be afraid to view it with your entire family.",5,'...FOR THEIR OWN GOOD...',1061942400,"08 27, 2003",2003,5147,"['Director', 'Phillip', 'Noyce',

598336,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JLD4,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[6, 6]","I was aware that the treatment of the Aborigines by those that settled Australia was fairly consistent with that of all European settlers dealing with indigenous people when &quot;colonizing&quot; someone else's land.  I specifically recall how during the 2000 Sydney Olympics much was made of the symbolism of Cathy Freeman, an Aborigine on the Australian Olympic team, lighting the Olympic torch.  Even more was made of the symbolism when Freeman went on to win the gold medal in the 400 meter.  But I have to admit that when it comes to Australian films I tend to think in terms of &quot;Breaker Morant&quot; and &quot;Gallipoli,&quot; where the point was how the British Empire was treating the Australian citizens of the Commonwealth as if nothing had changed since the first convicts were sent from Britain Down Under.  Still, to see Australians turn around and treat others even more inhumanely was rather something of a shock.&quot;Rabbit-Proof Fence&quot; is the story of three young Aborigine girls who escaped from a government camp in 1931 and tried to walk home 1,500 miles.  Molly (Everlyn Sampi), her sister Daisy (Tianna Sansbury) and cousin Gracie (Laura Monaghan) were taken from their mothers because they are half-castes, their white fathers long gone after constructing the rabbit-proof fence which saves Australia's farm land from being devoured.  The fence, of course, is both a metaphor for the separation of the children from their families as well as the touchstone that can help the girls get home.The reason the girls are removed is because of the edict of A.O. Neville (Kenneth Branagh), who was the administrator in charge of Aborigines in Western Australia.  As portrayed in the film Neville is concerned about the creation of a third race and has the idea that with the proper breeding within three generations the half-castes will look white.  Now there is conflicting historical evidence on how Aborigine children ended up at the Moore River Native Settlement pertaining to half-castes being ostracized by pure bloods and Aborigine parents wanted their children to receive an education.  But in &quot;Rabbit-Proof Fence&quot; the reasons are clearly to &quot;save&quot; these children from themselves, and there is an implication the education is so these children can be domestic servants for white families.Even if you did not see Branagh in &quot;Conspiracy,&quot; the TV movie where he played SS-Obergruppenf&uuml;hrer Reinhard Heydrich, Chief of the Reich Main Security Office, and chief architect of the &quot;Final Solution&quot; at the Wannsee Conference the parallels are unmistakable between Neville's theory of eugenics and the Nazis.  But once Molly leads the other two girls into the outback Neville is not as important to the chase as Modoo (David Gulpilil), the native tracker who is required to enforce the policies that are resulting in &quot;The Lost Generation&quot; of his people.  If this is a film that wants to see the world only in terms of black or white, there is no doubt which side wins your sympathy.Having made big budget Hollywood films like &quot;Patriot Games,&quot; &quot;Clear and Present Danger&quot; and &quot;The Bone Collector,&quot; director Phillip Noyes provides a more intimate film like he did back in 1977 with &quot;Backroads.&quot;  His three stars are a trio of first time actresses, selected (as he explains in the accompanying featurette) so that everybody in the world who say them would want to adopt them.  But they also turn out to act and Sampi as Molly Craig is at least as good as Keisha Castle-Hughes was in &quot;Whale Rider.&quot;This is a true story and as such you know not to expect a happy ending, but that does not stop your from harboring such hopes as the three girls continue on their journey and the authorities try to stop them before they reach their home and their families.  As a true story there will be the obligatory title cards at the end telling you the rest of the story and explaining how the practice of separating half-castes from their parents continued until 1970, which may well be a more depressing thought than anything engendered by the film.  But be forewarned that the most devastating scene on the DVD is not in the film when the girls are taken away from their wailing mothers, but in the featurette when we see what happens to the cast and crew after they finish filming that scene.Special note needs to be made of the commentary track provided by director Phillip Noyce and featuring musician Peter Gabriel, actor Kenneth Branagh, screenwriter Chiristine Olsen and author Pilkington Garimara.  This is not a track where everybody is in the room at once talking about the film.  Instead this is mostly Noyce talking about the film, totally independent of what is on the screen, and when he talks about one of the other principles we get to hear their thoughts on the process of turning the original book and the story it was based on into this film.  This is usually the sort of deep thoughts you get from a film critic doing the commentary on a Criterion Edition of a classic film, so finding it on this 2002 drama is a nice bonus.",5,A heartbreaking

It is about 3 little aboriginal girls who are literally STOLEN from their mother & family & sent to live in a crappy, abusive ""orphange"". And the whole thing was LEGAL!!!!!! I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT THIS WAS ALLOWED TO GO ON FOR SO LONG! At the end of this movie it says that this practice (that of kidnapping what they refer to as ""half-caste"" children from their families who love them and placing them into cold, strict & uncaring ""orphanages"") was practied right up until 1970!!!!!!!! WHERE IS THE OUTRAGE OVER THIS???????? HOW COULD THIS HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO HAPPEN????? I AM SO APPALLED & DISGUSTED BY THIS!!!!!! Well back to the movie...You really can't help but love these precious little girls as they are ripped from ths only home they have ever known & taken away against their and their families wishes. Well the 3 girls do manage to make a break from the orphanage and begin their journey back home. AND A VERY LONG AND DIFFICULT JOURNEY IT IS! But bless their little hearts they never give up!! The ending for me was bittersweet. I was glad that 2 of ths girls made it back & were reunited with their family. But the 3rd girl did not make it back home. That was sad. And there was future troubles for this family as well. All I can say is that these girls were HEROES FOR MAKING THAT JOURNEY & I AM SO GLAD THAT THIS FILM WAS MADE. EVERYONE SHOULD SEE THIS FILM! It will really make you apprecaite the freedoms that you have. I highly reccomend this film to EVERYONE!!! But!, BE PREPARED to be sad & disgusted. (Just a fair warning to you.)

598338,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B00005JLD4,Linda Linguvic,"[171, 182]","Between 1905 and 1971, the Australian government had a horrible policy.  They forcibly removed all half-caste Aboriginal children to special training schools.  The grown daughter of one of these children wrote a book about her mother's experiences.  This film is an adaptation of that book.The story takes place in 1931, when Molly, then 14, her sister Daily, then 8, and her cousin Gracie, then 10, are literally torn from the arms of their mothers, put in a cage, and taken 1,200 miles away to a school which is actually a sort of prison.  Here, they are forbidden to speak their own language, they have to attend a Christian church, and are taught the ways of the white Australian culture around them.  Led by Molly, the girls run away.  And most of the film is the odyssey of their trek back home, following the rabbit-proof fence that bisects Australia, constructed to keep rabbits out of the pastureland.The villain is clearly the white director of the school. It is amazing, but he actually believes in the racial theories that were prevalent at the time. He believes he is helping them and plays his role well, coming across as stupid and misguided rather than evil.  The Aboriginal girls are all unknowns, and terrific actresses, as are the women who play Molly and Daisy's mother and grandmother. The courage and determination of the girls during their three-month journey, the people they meet along the way, and their efforts to dodge the trackers who have been sent to retrieve them by the school, is truly inspiring.  This is all set against the backdrop of the Australian outback; the cinematography certainly captures its beauty.The film is 94 minutes long and moves quickly.  I immediately identified with the girls and felt their fear as well as their bravery as they made their way across the Australian continent.  In a postscript to the story, we learn more about their lives.  It did not turn out to be pretty.  But two of the girls have survived into their nineties, and we meet them briefly.  They are strong women with weathered faces, one of them walking with a cane, but clearly at home in their Outback surroundings.The film is a lesson in inspiration and courage as well as a geography and history lesson about Australia.

There was more weight given to eugenics than to establishing the personalities of the girls. There are scenes where people along the way assist the girls with food and coats, but in a walk of that distance that took a couple months, there must have been something more dramatic to deal with.(lack of water, dingos, poisonous snakes?)The documentary in the special features was actually more interesting as you get to see the real personalities of the people involved.

I can think of nothing more insidious and cruel.My research led me to an article written by a woman who interviewed several of these children.  I read other documentation of 'the stolen generation', and this later led to the filming of the story of Molly Craig, her younger sister and cousin, Gracie, and Daisy who escaped entrapment at the missionary settlement where they were imprisoned.  And how, under Molly's strength and leadership, they began the arduous 1500 mile journey to return to their family.This powerful and emotional packed film of courage, determination, and a deep sense of cultural faith is based on actual events, thanks to the book written by Molly's daughter, Doris Pilkington Garimara.I encourage you to see this heartbreaking film.  I am convince this will prompt you to learn more about the abusive and cruel policy by the British/Australian government, which 'stole' the human rights of countless children and their families by a contemptible practice of racial purification, which continued [in many places] through the 70's.Maizie Lucille JamesMay 29, 2010",5,The Stolen Generation: A Story Of Courage and Defiance,1275091200,"05 29, 2010",2010,1771,"['When', 'read', 'news', 'accounts', 'was', 'not', '2008', 'when', 'Austrian', 'government', 'got', 'apologizing', 'Aborigine', 'culture', 'policy', 'removing', 'half-caste', 'children', 'families', 'felt', 'compelled', 'learn', 'as', 'much', 'could', 'about', 'atrocity.Based', 'legislation', 'began', '1869', 'Aboriginal', 'Protection', 'Act', 'would', 'expand', '20th', 'century', 'more', 'concise', 'language', 'continue', 'horrendous', 'practice', 'forceful', 'cruel', 'child', 'removal', 'half-caste', 'families', 'indict', 'racist', 'bigoted', 'system', 'sole', 'aim', 'was', 'bleed', 'breed', 'black', 'then', ""'re-socialize"", 'culture', 'guardian', 'oppressors', 'can', 'think', 'nothing', 'more', 'insidious', 'cruel.My', 'research', 'led', 'article', 'written', 'woman', 'who', 'interviewed', 'several', 'children', 'read', 'other', 'documentation', ""'the"", 'stolen', 'generation', 'later', 'led', 'filming', 'story', 'Molly', 'Craig', 'younger', 'sister', 'cousin', 'Gracie', 'Daisy', 'who', 'escaped', 'entrapment', 'missionary', 'settlement', 'where', 'were', 'imprisoned', 'how', 'Molly', 'strength', 'leadership', 'began', 'arduous', '1500', 'mile', 'journey', 'return', 'family.This', 'powerful', 'emotional', 'packed', 'film', 'courage', 'determination', 'deep', 'sense', 'cultural', 'faith', 'based', 'actual', 'events', 'thanks', 'book', 'written', 'Molly', 'daughter', 'Doris', 'Pilkington', 'Garimara.I', 'encourage', 'see', 'heartbreaking', 'film', 'am', 'convince', 'will', 'prompt', 'learn', 'more', 'abusive', 'cruel', 'policy', 'British/Australian', 'government', 'human', 'rights', 'countless', 'children', 'families', 'contemptible', 'practice', 'racial', 'purification', 'continued', '[', 'many', 'places', ']', ""70's.Maizie"", 'Lucille', 'JamesMay', '29', '2010']",Rabbit-Proof Fence

Ever since I got the soundtrack album for it, composed and performed by Peter Gabriel, I knew I had to check it out, since Peter never lends his name to productions that are not worth it.

The movie combines visuals, music and performances in a way that I can only relate to the experience of watching ""Until The End of the World"" or ""Whale Rider"".The story takes place in Australia, during the first part of the XX century, at a time when the lives of the aboriginal people were controlled in an absurd manner, obligating them to do things for their ""own benefit"", such as separating the young children from their parents. Three little aboriginal girls escape a camp where children are kept and walk back over a thousand miles by the rabbit-proof fence that they remember leads back home, in an effort to reunite with their mothers.The performances by the girls, who were new to acting, will leave a deep mark in you, as will the impeccable music that accompanies the shots of the incredible spaces of the Australian outback.

598345,A3E5VKPVU8LAIT,B00005JLD4,Manolis Vozalis,"[9, 11]","'Rabbit-proof Fence' tells the story of three Aborigine girls who were taken from their home and were transferred to a special school, where they could learn the manners of white people. That was part of a bigger Australian Government plan to 'assimilate' half-caste children into the white community, a plan monitored and executed by the Chief ""Protector"" of Aborigines. Soon the three girls would commence on a long journey back to their home.This is a story that given to the wrong hands, could easily have turned into a Hollywood melodrama. Still, Phillip Noyce, mostly known for his action flicks, like 'Patriot Games' or 'The Bone Collector', keeps his direction simple and true. He cares for his characters and uses his visual skills in the right direction.He has the help of a nicely assembled cast, that in its majority consists of amateur actors. The three girls, playing the lead parts, and especially Everlyn Sampi as Molly, are impressive. The only big star of the movie is Kenneth Branagh. He succeeds in making us believe that the Chief ""Protector"" of Aborigines truly believes in his task. He feels responsible for those kids, and genuinely thinks that driving them away from their homes is for their own good. David Gulpilill as the aboriginal tracker sent to find the girls, does not have to utter many phrases, but gives a solid performance, mostly based on his facial expressions.The cinematography is gripping, thanks to the breathtaking Australian landscape. The music, written by Peter Gabriel, is right to the point. Still at a few points I would prefer it, if the volume was just a notch lower.My only objection to the movie is its duration. I know and feel that the girls were like birds in a cage, while at the boarding school. Still, I was not totally convinced, by the scenes of their stay there, that they would decide to escape so abruptly. I know and feel that the road back to their home is a tough one, full of obstacles and challenges.

598349,A319KYEIAZ3SON,B00005JLD4,Mary Whipple,"[2, 3]","Set in Australia's bleak outback, this 2002 film takes place in 1931, when white bureaucrats forced their own morality on aboriginal half-castes living in the bush.  Believing that these half-white children &quot;deserved&quot; the &quot;advantages&quot; of &quot;civilization,&quot; and convinced that in three generations their blackness could be &quot;bred out,&quot; the Australian government forcibly removed them from their families, brought them to settlements hundreds of miles from their homes, and trained them to be domestic servants.  Forty years later the government finally abandoned the policy, leaving a &quot;Stolen Generation&quot; in its wake.  Molly Craig has long been the symbol of the Aborigines' refusal to accept this genocidal policy, and this film, brilliantly directed by Philip Noyce, celebrates her unconquerable spirit in the face of sanctioned governmental cruelty.Molly Craig (Everlyn Sampi), her cousin Gracie (Laura Monaghan), and her sister (Tianna Sansbury), aged thirteen to eight, are cruelly removed from their mothers in Jigalong (Western Territories) and taken a thousand miles to the Moore River Native Settlement, which is directed by the self-righteous Mr. Neville (convincingly played by Kenneth Branagh), who believes in the inherent correctness of the resettlement policy.  Placed in overcrowded dormitories, prohibited from using their own language, and required to live according to another world's rules, Molly, her sister, and her cousin decide to escape by following the 1500-mile &quot;rabbit-proof fence,&quot; which borders both the settlement and their distant home.  They must avoid detection by a hired Aborigine tracker (played menacingly by David Gulpilil) and by government workers and white settlers.  For nine grueling weeks, the girls live virtually on their own, surviving through their ancestral knowledge of the land.Written by Molly Craig's daughter, Doris Pilkington Garimara, who, later, was also removed from her mother Molly and forced to live in a settlement, the film is a moving celebration of the human spirit, a tribute to Molly Craig, and a plea to acknowledge the rights of aboriginal peoples, wherever they may live.  The harsh and unforgiving land is beautifully photographed, and the haunting music of aboriginal voices and instruments in the Golden Globe-nominated score by Peter Gabriel further the realism.  The cast of young girls, all making their film debuts, never makes a misstep, conveying the trauma of their separation, their commitment to returning home, and, in Sampi's case, an anger which is only barely hidden.  Branagh, though effective, really does not have to do much to be the villain here.  In this beautifully realized depiction of a wrong-headed policy, director Noyce wisely chooses not to embellish the message with unnecessary, artificial melodrama--reality here is drama enough.

598350,A68QXK0H88J4I,B00005JLD4,matt,"[1, 3]","After reading so many rave reviews of the film I was sure that I had a winner. I showed it to a human geography class and all I can say is we were rather disappointed in the drawn out, poorly acted, poorly scripted film. Moreover, the arc of the story wasn't too compelling. And the story wasn't there at all. The characters remained the same throughout, and it tried to portray real events with dissapointing inaccuracy. Peter Gabriel's scoring was a welcome surprise, however, with a sound reminiscent of The Last Temptation of Christ.On a technical level, I was surprised that the story failed to show in any way just what it was that motivated the whites to want to ""civilize"" the aborigines (forced marriages, the common unacceptance of half-whites in their communities, etc). I am not saying that cultural extermination/relocation is a good thing in any way, or that keeping folks apart on the basis of skin color is ethical at all, but one would get the impression from this film that the natives were doing just fine until the whites showed up destroyed their idyllic culture. That simply isn't true. Their culture left a great deal to be desired (especially from a modern, liberal perspective). The status of women, for example, wasn't at all shown for what it was.What is ironic is the girl who played Molly in the film ran away from the filming because she didn't want to do it anymore, and she was brought back repeatedly. She was also sent to a boarding school after the filming by the director! Lastly, when the real Molly Craig viewed this film, upon whom the film I supposedly based, she simply said, ""This is not my story.""It's worth a viewing, but only as a piece of poorly scripted fiction.",3,Not really a true story.,1291420800,"12 4, 2010",2010,1709,"['reading', 'so', 'many', 'rave', 'reviews', 'film', 'was', 'sure', 'had', 'winner', 'showed', 'human', 'geography', 'class', 'can', 'say', 'were', 'rather', 'disappointed', 'drawn', 'out', 'poorly', 'acted', 'poorly', 'scripted', 'film', 'Moreover', 'arc', 'story', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'compelling', 'story', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', 'characters', 'remained', 'same', 'tried', 'portray', 'real', 'events', 'dissapointing', 'inaccuracy', 'Peter', 'Gabriel', 'scoring', 'was', 'welcome', 'surprise', 'however', 'sound', 'reminiscent', 'Last', 'Temptation', 'Christ.On', 'technical', 'level', 'was', 'surprised', 'story', 'failed', 'show', 'way', 'just', 'what', 'was', 'motivated', 'whites', 'want', 'civilize', 'aborigines', 'forced', 'marriages', 'common', 'unacceptance', 'half-whites', 'communities', 'etc', 'am', 'not', 'saying', 'cultural', 'extermination/relocation', 'good', 'thing', 'way', 'keeping', 'folks', 'apart', 'basis', 'skin', 'color', 'ethical', 'one', 'would', 'get', 'impression', 'film', 'natives', 'were', 'doing', 'just', 'fine', 'whites', 'showed', 'destroyed', 'idyllic', 'culture', 'simply', ""n't"", 'true', 'culture', 'left', 'great', 'deal', 'be', 'desired', 'especially', 'modern', 'liberal', 'perspective', 'status', 'women', 'example', 'was', ""n't"", 'shown', 'what', 'was.What', 'ironic', 'girl', 'who', 'played', 'Molly', 'film', 'ran', 'away', 'filming', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'do', 'anymore', 'was', 'brought', 'back', 'repeatedly', 'was', 'also', 'sent', 'boarding', 'school', 'filming', 'director', 'Lastly', 'when', 'real', 'Molly', 'Craig', 'viewed', 'film', 'whom', 'film', 'supposedly', 'based', 'simply', 'said', 'not', 'story', 'viewing', 'only', 'piece', 'poorly', 'scripted', 'fiction']",Rabbit-Proof Fence
598351,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B00005JLD4,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[0, 0]","Rabbit Proof Fence tells the gripping and extremely painful story of three young ""half-caste"" girls who were forcibly taken from their mother in Australia in 1931. These girls joined other children of mixed race in a ""settlement"" camp where they were taught values and customs against their will with the goal of making them maids and servants for the white people living in Australia. It was also hoped that without any ""inbreeding"" between white people and the aboriginal people, the aborigines would be eventually snuffed out after two generations. This story is clearly not a Disney movie; it's extremely painful but because this is based on real events the story deserves to be told very loudly and clearly so the world knows the injustices done against aboriginal people.When the film starts, we see sisters Molly and Daisy (Everlyn Sampi and Tianna Sansbury, respectively), torn away from their mother along with their cousin Gracie (Laura Monaghan). The three children are moved to the Moore River ""native settlement"" camp where they must only speak English; and they must adhere only to Christian values while eschewing the values, customs and religious beliefs of their people. The girls are terrified; but when Molly, the eldest of the three, decides they need to walk back the 1,200 miles to their mother's village in Jigalong, Australia, the two younger children also choose to run away with her.As many reviewers note, this film keeps you on the edge of your seat every step of the way. Not only is the plot as realistic as possible, the acting of the three children and the cinematography is excellent. Look also for great performances by Kenneth Branagh as A.O. Neville, the ""protector"" of the aboriginal people and Ningali Lawford as Maud, the mother of Molly and Daisy and caretaker of Gracie.The symbolism of the ""rabbit proof fence"" is quite clear. It's not just a way to keep rabbits escaping into the native areas; the fence represents the white people's attempts to separate themselves from another race who they perceive to be inferior. The fence is also a way to keep the aboriginal people out of the white man's land. I am appalled that Australia continued to forcibly remove ""half-caste"" mixed race children from their parents until sometime in 1970.Watch this film and see how the three girls make their escape from Moore River camp and make the journey back to Jigalong. Will all three girls make it? Will they evade the hunt for them by A.O. Neville and his local assistant Moodoo (David Gulpilil)? No plot spoilers--watch the movie and find out!Rabbit Proof Fence is an outstanding movie that won many awards; and it received critical praise.

The fences of the title are those that ran almost the full length of Australia in an attempt to stamp out a problem involved with the over population of rabbits that plagued Australia in the 1930's.There is a particularly horrendous scene involving Mr. Neville (Kenneth Branagh), whom the Aborigines call ""Mr. Devil,"" who talks to a group of women about how the Australian Government hopes to rid Australia of Aborigines through the use of inter-breeding with Caucasians:""All it takes is three generations to accomplish,"" he says with a self-satisfied smile on his face. Disgusting.Molly and Daisy and at first Gracie (who is captured) have very strong ties to their mothers who seem to be guiding them home...some 1800 miles away from the school.  Daisy and Molly are guided by more than a knowledge of the land and of tracking in particular but by the mystical nature of love: there is a magical scene in which Molly's Mother has her hand on the fence 1800 miles away from Molly who also has her hand on the fence and you can tell that they can ""feel"" each other.Much of ""Rabbit Proof Fence"" reminds me Peter Weir's ""The Last Wave"" another film with the strong reverberations of another world, another level of reality.

598355,A1O8CMSX57V7AZ,B00005JLD4,Michael,"[5, 7]","This is a very compelling story about the Australian Government policy from the early 1900's through 1970 to relocate Aborigine children to orphanages by taking them from their families and their mothers.  What is lacking is the usual guns and bloodshed associated with genocide, but the goal is the same.  To entirely wipe out a culture is the purpose of genocide, and bloodless genocide is no less a crime against humanity.  In the case, the Aborigne culture of Australia is over 40,000 years old and maybe the oldest surviving culture on Earth. Gracie, Daisy, and Molly did not cooperate with this plan of the &quot;master race,&quot; and ran away.  This was the start of a 1,500 mile walk home.  Three little girls knew that if they found the rabbit proof fence that stretched across Australia and headed north, they would end up at home.  This is a stretch of land that is one of the most forbidding on the planet.This is the story about the &quot;lost generations.&quot; Both the trek home and committing this wonderful story of survival against wrong were monumental tasks. Director Phillip Noyce conducted numerous auditions with aborigne girls.  After he makes his selections, he warns them, like any good grandfather, to not get spoiled.  Like other grandfathers, he then proceeds to spoil what seems to be his three adopted grandchildren.  A less kind hearted Director would not be able to pull off what this movie accomplishes.  The special features of the DVD documents how the film crew became like a family, with all of the playfullness, teasing, tears, arguments and making up of a real family (or tribe).  When the scene was shot for the movie of the girls being taken away from their families, there were tears and charged emotions put on film.  When the scene ended and the cameras stopped, the crew had to take a prolonged break because the emotions hadn't stopped.  Aboriginal actresses and acting coaches along with the white crew had to hug and cry all the way out what they had started.  Later, when you see the aborigine girls during informal play  and interaction with others, it is easy to recognize the similarities to the little princess daughter or grand daughter you may have at home.Please don't miss the deeper levels of this movie.  If you look deeper, there is quite a statement within this movie about motherhood, daughterhood, and sisterhood. Perhaps, even a mother nature/earth statement.  A full response to the governments question of intelligence is a challenge to come up with a universal standard.  Is intelligence quotations from Shakespeare while undergoing death by thirst, starvation and elements in the outback?  Or is it squeezing the water from roots of plants, catching, roasting and eating giant lizards or eating beetle larva.  I know exactly whom I want to be with in the outback. It isn't Sydney from Sydney.  It is Gracie, Daisy, and Molly. It is Moodoo, the tracker in this film that is pretending to follow the girls but never quite catching them.  Can you recognize him?He is the same person that played the Aborigne teenager many years ago in &quot;Walk About.&quot;  He looks like he is in the same physical condition and ready for the next &quot;walk about.&quot;  I really want to see more movies like this highlighting Aborignal culture and the Australian landscape.",5,Aborigine struggle against a racist white Aussie Government.,1057536000,"07 7, 2003",2003,3330,"['very', 'compelling', 'story', 'Australian', 'Government', 'policy', 'early', '1900', '1970', 'relocate', 'Aborigine', 'children', 'orphanages', 'taking', 'families', 'mothers', 'What', 'lacking', 'usual', 'guns', 'bloodshed', 'associated', 'genocide', 'goal', 'same', 'entirely', 'wipe', 'out', 'culture', 'purpose', 'genocide', 'bloodless', 'genocide', 'less', 'crime', 'humanity', 'case', 'Aborigne', 'culture', 'Australia', '40,000', 'years', 'old', 'maybe', 'oldest', 'surviving', 'culture', 'Earth', 'Gracie', 'Daisy', 'Molly', 'did', 'not', 'cooperate', 'plan', 'quot', 'master', 'race', 'quot', 'ran', 'away', 'was', 'start', '1,500', 'mile', 'walk', 'home', 'Three', 'little', 'girls', 'knew', 'found', 'rabbit', 'proof', 'fence', 'stretched', 'Australia', 'headed', 'north', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'home', 'stretch', 'land', 'one', 'most', 'forbidding', 'planet.This', 'story', 'quot', 'lost', 'generations.', 'quot', 'trek', 'home', 'committing', 'wonderful', 'story', 'survival', 'wrong', 'were', 'monumental', 'tasks', 'Director', 'Phillip', 'Noyce', 'conducted', 'numerous', 'auditions', 'aborigne', 'girls', 'selections', 'good', 'grandfather', 'not', 'get', 'spoiled', 'other', 'grandfathers', 'then', 'spoil', 'what', 'be', 'three', 'adopted', 'grandchildren', 'A', 'less', 'kind', 'hearted', 'Director', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'pull', 'off', 'what', 'movie', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'documents', 'how', 'film', 'crew', 'became', 'family', 'playfullness', 'teasing', 'tears', 'arguments', 'making', 'up', 'real', 'family', 'tribe', 'When', 'scene', 'was', 'shot', 'movie', 'girls', 'being', 'taken', 'away', 'families', 'were', 'tears', 'charged', 'emotions', 'put', 'film', 'When', 'scene', 'ended', 'cameras', 'stopped', 'crew', 'had', 'take', 'prolonged', 'break', 'emotions', 'had', ""n't"", 'stopped', 'Aboriginal', 'actresses', 'acting', 'coaches', 'white', 'crew', 'had', 'hug', 'cry', 'way', 'out', 'what', 'had', 'started', 'Later', 'when', 'see', 'aborigine', 'girls', 'informal', 'play', 'interaction', 'others', 'easy', 'recognize', 'similarities', 'little', 'princess', 'daughter', 'grand', 'daughter', 'may', 'have', 'home.Please', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'deeper', 'levels', 'movie', 'look', 'deeper', 'quite', 'statement', 'movie', 'motherhood', 'daughterhood', 'sisterhood', 'Perhaps', 'even', 'mother', 'nature/earth', 'statement', 'full', 'response', 'governments', 'question', 'intelligence', 'challenge', 'come', 'up', 'universal', 'standard', 'intelligence', 'quotations', 'Shakespeare', 'undergoing', 'death', 'thirst', 'starvation', 'elements', 'outback', 'squeezing', 'water', 'roots', 'plants', 'catching', 'roasting', 'eating', 'giant', 'lizards', 'eating', 'beetle', 'larva', 'know', 'exactly', 'whom', 'want', 'be', 'outback', ""n't"", 'Sydney', 'Sydney', 'Gracie', 'Daisy', 'Molly', 'Moodoo', 'tracker', 'film', 'pretending', 'follow', 'girls', 'never', 'quite', 'catching', 'Can', 'recognize', 'same', 'person', 'played', 'Aborigne', 'teenager', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'quot', 'Walk', 'About.', 'quot', 'same', 'physical', 'condition', 'ready', 'next', 'quot', 'quot', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'more', 'movies', 'highlighting', 'Aborignal', 'culture', 'Australian', 'landscape']",Rabbit-Proof Fence

598358,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B00005JLD4,mirasreviews,"[17, 18]","In Australia prior to 1970, the law gave the &quot;Chief Protector of the Aborigines&quot; legal guardianship of all the Aborigine people and the power to forcibly remove half-white Aborigines from their homes and place them in schools where they would be educated in the ways of White society. In 1931, the &quot;Chief Protector of the Aborigines&quot; was a man named A.O. Neville (Kenneth Branaugh). &quot;Rabbit-Proof  Fence&quot; is the story of three half-Aborigine girls whom Mr. Neville ordered removed from their mothers' care and the girls' courageous journey back home. Molly(Everlyn Sampi), who was the oldest at 14 years, her young sister Daisy (Tianna Sansbury), and their cousin Gracie (Laura Monaghan) were placed far from their home in the &quot;Moore River Native Settlement&quot; for their education. This is the story of the girls' 9-week journey on foot, following Australia's continent-spanning rabbit-proof fence, to try to reach their home and family in northern Australia.&quot;Rabbit-Proof Fence&quot; is a true story, based on the book written by Molly's daughter, Doris Pilkington. This is a stunningly beautiful film in its portrayal of the Australian landscape and its native peoples. Thanks to the beautiful cinematography and the excellent performances, &quot;Rabbit-Proof Fence&quot; is riveting all the way through even though the story of people trudging across a continent on foot offers little variation. Everlyn Sampi gives an outstanding performance as Molly, who is responsible for the fate of her young charges for the course of their arduous journey. Molly is a young woman of few words, but she speaks volumes with her eyes and is magnetic in her ability to fix the audience's attention on the screen. The other great performance is that of Kenneth Branaugh as A.O. Neville, the cause of all the girls' -and many other Aborigines'- troubles. It would have been very easy -but inaccurate, I think- to portray Neville as a horrible power-mongering bureaucrat. With relatively few scenes or dialogue, Branaugh effectively communicates that Neville's intentions were essentially good and that he took his responsibilities seriously. That said, the film does not shy away from demonstrating that his actions were misguided and ultimately very destructive to Australia's Aborigine people and to the nation's moral fabric.

JEFFREY MCMAHON ""herculodge""","[3, 6]","Based on a real story of three half-white, half-Aborigine girls who were legally kidnapped and torn from their mothers in a small Australian village, Rabbit Proof Fence is a compelling, never sentimental, fast-paced account of an odious racial ""purification"" program exercised in Australia from early 1900 to 1970, giving these poor children the tag ""The Lost Generations."" Mostly these poor children were kept in camps where they were to be, ostensibly, taught in the ways of Australian white middle-class society so that, after three generations, their ""blackness"" would disappear. But in truth these children were really trained to be domestics or slaves for white land owners. In the film, we get to know the three girls and find that the oldest, Molly, is very street smart and perceives that the camp she and her cousins are in is a deadend. There's only one thing to do: reunite with their mothers, so they make their escape. Much of the film shows us the harrowing journey that these three girls make and the spiritual strength, inspired by the bond between them and their mothers, that they draw from to make their dangerous trek in the desert. What's remarkable about this film is how dead-on the acting is from the three girls, ages between seven and thirteen. The director, who discussed in great detail the casting in the documentary section of the DVD, says that finding the right girls would make or break the film. He shows how he gained the girls' trust, taught them to act (they were not professional actors), and most of all, explains how they lost their innocence and connected themselves to a part of their history that until then they were not clear about. This is the only DVD where the documentary footage on the making of the film is as compelling as the film itself.

Between 1900 and 1970, at least 100,000 Aboriginal children of mixed blood - called ""half caste"" - were taken from their families by the Australian government. Some were surrendered with their parents' consent, but many were forcibly removed. They have been referred to as the Stolen Generations. These children were placed in government or church-run schools in an attempt to assimilate them into white culture. The living conditions in these institutions were generally poor. The children were also discouraged from speaking their own languages, and also from marrying full-blood Aboriginals, the belief being that if they intermarried with whites instead, all Aboriginal traits could be ""bred out"" within four generations. It was common for children to attempt escape from these facilities, but most never made it far before being recaptured. This story, however, is different.The film ""Rabbit-Proof Fence,"" based on the book ""Molly's Daughter"" by Doris Pilkington (which is in turn based on the true story of her own mother), follows three girls in the 1930's - two of them sisters and the third a cousin - who are taken from their family as described above. They are placed in the Moore River Camp, almost 2000 kilometers from their home. It is not long before the eldest girl, Molly, decides that they must escape and return to their family. Molly (14 years old), Gracie (10 years), and Daisy (8 years) soon find their way to the rabbit-proof fence of the title, a structure bisecting the entire continent with the aim of keeping rabbits on one side and good farmland on the other. Knowing that their village lies along the fence, they set out on an arduous nine-week journey to follow it home, all the while tracked by those that want them recaptured.This is an amazing film in so many ways. The casting all around is brilliant, but the three girls who play Molly, Gracie, and Daisy are particularly remarkable. None of them had any previous acting experience, but their performances are completely natural, neither underacted nor over-the-top. Most amazing of all is Everlyn Sampi (actually 12, though her charatcer is 14) as Molly, and Tianna Sansbury as young Daisy is also incredibly talented for a 7-year-old. I hope both of them choose to go on to work in other movies, because they truly have a rare natural talent. The rest of the cast is also superb, with the notable Kenneth Branagh taking a key role as A.O. Neville, official ""Protector of the Aborigines"" in Western Australia.The cinematography and soundtrack are also quite perfect. One really gets a feel for how beautiful, and how rugged and forbidding, the Western Australian desert country can be. For anyone to have made a 1,500-mile journey across it on foot is remarkable, and for this to have been accomplished by such young children is truly inspirational. The film also shows the complicated interplay of race relations quite well. It is not a clear-cut black-and-white issue (and clearly the protagonists are neither fully Aboriginal, nor fully white themselves). There are of course characters firmly planted on one side or the other, but there are also many stuck in the middle, such as the Aboriginal man employed as a tracker to recover the runaways, or the half-caste laundry woman - herself a former ward of the Moore River Camp - who attempts to help them along the way. These characters hightlight the turmoil of being stuck between two worlds. It should also be noted that not all white people in the film are portrayed as villains, as we see the girls aided by sympathetic non-Aborginals as well.The DVD offers only two special features - commentary with the director, screenwriter, author, and Kenneth Branagh, as well as a documentary on the making of the film - but the documentary, ""Following the Rabbit-Proof Fence"" is well worth watching. I was touched to see how intent director Phillip Noyce was on getting the movie just right, so that it would resonate with both the descendants of those included in the Stolen Generations, and with a white Australian audience. The lengths he went to in order to find just the right three girls to play Molly, Gracie, and Daisy - flying to numerous remote towns to interview hundreds of children - are also impressive. Even more touching is to see just how much the young actors put into the film. In one shot we see the entire cast and crew reduced to tears after filming the abduction scene at the beginning of the movie. In conclusion, I would highly recommend this film to any viewer, and plan to add it to my own collection as well.",5,"Beautiful story of hardship, courage, love, and perseverance.",1157241600,"09 3, 2006",2006,4667,"['definitely', 'been', 'one', 'most', 'moving', 'inspirational', 'films', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'recently', 'Between', '1900', '1970', 'least', '100,000', 'Aboriginal', 'children', 'mixed', 'blood', 'called', 'half', 'caste', 'were', 'taken', 'families', 'Australian', 'government', 'were', 'surrendered', 'parents', 'consent', 'many', 'were', 'forcibly', 'removed', 'have', 'been', 'referred', 'Stolen', 'Generations', 'children', 'were', 'placed', 'government', 'church-run', 'schools', 'attempt', 'assimilate', 'white', 'culture', 'living', 'conditions', 'institutions', 'were', 'generally', 'poor', 'children', 'were', 'also', 'discouraged', 'speaking', 'own', 'languages', 'also', 'marrying', 'full-blood', 'Aboriginals', 'belief', 'being', 'intermarried', 'whites', 'instead', 'Aboriginal', 'traits', 'could', 'be', 'bred', 'out', 'four', 'generations', 'was', 'common', 'children', 'attempt', 'escape', 'facilities', 'most', 'never', 'made', 'far', 'being', 'recaptured', 'story', 'however', 'different.The', 'film', 'Rabbit-Proof', 'Fence', 'based', 'book', 'Molly', 'Daughter', 'Doris', 'Pilkington', 'turn', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'own', 'mother', 'three', 'girls', '1930', 'two', 'sisters', 'third', 'cousin', 'who', 'are', 'taken', 'family', 'described', 'are', 'placed', 'Moore', 'River', 'Camp', 'almost', '2000', 'kilometers', 'home', 'not', 'long', 'eldest', 'girl', 'Molly', 'must', 'escape', 'return', 'family', 'Molly', '14', 'years', 'old', 'Gracie', '10', 'years', 'Daisy', '8', 'years', 'soon', 'find', 'way', 'rabbit-proof', 'fence', 'title', 'structure', 'bisecting', 'entire', 'continent', 'aim', 'keeping', 'rabbits', 'one', 'side', 'good', 'farmland', 'other', 'Knowing', 'village', 'fence', 'set', 'out', 'arduous', 'nine-week', 'journey', 'follow', 'home', 'while', 'tracked', 'want', 'recaptured.This', 'amazing', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'casting', 'around', 'brilliant', 'three', 'girls', 'who', 'play', 'Molly', 'Gracie', 'Daisy', 'are', 'particularly', 'remarkable', 'None', 'had', 'previous', 'acting', 'experience', 'performances', 'are', 'completely', 'natural', 'neither', 'underacted', 'over-the-top', 'Most', 'amazing', 'Everlyn', 'Sampi', 'actually', '12', 'charatcer', '14', 'Molly', 'Tianna', 'Sansbury', 'young', 'Daisy', 'also', 'incredibly', 'talented', '7-year-old', 'hope', 'choose', 'go', 'work', 'other', 'movies', 'truly', 'have', 'rare', 'natural', 'talent', 'rest', 'cast', 'also', 'superb', 'notable', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'taking', 'key', 'role', 'A.O', 'Neville', 'official', 'Protector', 'Aborigines', 'Western', 'Australia.The', 'cinematography', 'soundtrack', 'are', 'also', 'quite', 'perfect', 'One', 'really', 'feel', 'how', 'beautiful', 'how', 'rugged', 'forbidding', 'Western', 'Australian', 'desert', 'country', 'can', 'be', 'anyone', 'have', 'made', '1,500-mile', 'journey', 'foot', 'remarkable', 'have', 'been', 'accomplished', 'such', 'young', 'children', 'truly', 'inspirational', 'film', 'also', 'complicated', 'interplay', 'race', 'relations', 'quite', 'well', 'not', 'clear-cut', 'black-and-white', 'issue', 'clearly', 'protagonists', 'are', 'fully', 'Aboriginal', 'fully', 'white', 'are', 'course', 'characters', 'firmly', 'planted', 'one', 'side', 'other', 'are', 'also', 'many', 'stuck', 'middle', 'such', 'Aboriginal', 'man', 'employed', 'tracker', 'recover', 'runaways', 'half-caste', 'laundry', 'woman', 'former', 'ward', 'Moore', 'River', 'Camp', 'who', 'help', 'along', 'way', 'characters', 'hightlight', 'turmoil', 'being', 'stuck', 'two', 'worlds', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'noted', 'not', 'white', 'people', 'film', 'are', 'portrayed', 'villains', 'see', 'girls', 'aided', 'sympathetic', 'non-Aborginals', 'well.The', 'DVD', 'only', 'two', 'special', 'features', 'commentary', 'director', 'screenwriter', 'author', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'as', 'well', 'documentary', 'making', 'film', 'documentary', 'Following', 'Rabbit-Proof', 'Fence', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'was', 'touched', 'see', 'how', 'intent', 'director', 'Phillip', 'Noyce', 'was', 'getting', 'movie', 'just', 'right', 'would', 'resonate', 'descendants', 'included', 'Stolen', 'Generations', 'white', 'Australian', 'audience', 'lengths', 'went', 'order', 'find', 'just', 'right', 'three', 'girls', 'play', 'Molly', 'Gracie', 'Daisy', 'flying', 'numerous', 'remote', 'towns', 'interview', 'hundreds', 'children', 'are', 'also', 'impressive', 'Even', 'more', 'touching', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'young', 'actors', 'put', 'film', 'one', 'shot', 'see', 'entire', 'cast', 'crew', 'reduced', 'tears', 'filming', 'abduction', 'scene', 'beginning', 'movie', 'conclusion', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'viewer', 'plan', 'add', 'own', 'collection', 'well']",Rabbit-Proof Fence
598365,AZTIDJ4BACLHB,B00005JLD4,Movie Addict NZ,"[5, 5]","Rabbit-Proof Fence is a wonderful film which the world's largest audience, America, has yet to see. Directed by Phillip Noyce of Bone Collector fame, it follows two sisters; Molly and Daisy and their cousin Gracie. Born half-caste children in the 1930's (white fathers with Aboriginal mothers), their fathers have had a quick bit of fun while building a rabbit-proof fence then long since moved on. The fence stretches from one side of Australia to the other. As a law, half-caste children come under rule of a man named Mr A.O. Neville (Kenneth Branagh). He orders the three young girls to be taken from their mothers and placed in a 'concentration camp' like place over 1500 miles from home. Any girl who tries to escape will be tracked down by a man named Moodoo who will have her punished. The three girls manage to escape into the vast untouched land on a trek back home, covering their tracks on the way. Always one step ahead of Moodoo, they come across the occasional people on their farms. Not knowing who to trust they must take risks. The girls realise that the only way to get back home is to follow the Rabbit-Proof Fence.I was lucky enough to go to one of the New Zealand Premieres. After recognising the talanted Christine Olsen (Screenwriter/Producer) from the television and newspapers I decided to approach her. What a wonderful woman she was. We talked about all different things for about 15 - 20 minutes and would have continued if only she didn't have to introduce the film. She grabbed the only Press Kit they had there and personally signed it to me which was a real delight. The movie turned out to be brilliant. The screenplay was amazing and the silence said about as much as the words. The young barely trained actresses playing the girls did a magnificent job. Well directed and a must-see for anyone and everyone.

That said, this is not a film strictly about 'That Evil Racist', although it is a testament to Branaugh's thespian talent that the man doesn't come off reeking of that despicable label.Nary a false note in this exquisitely realised film. One of the few films regarding racial 'misunderstandings' (too light a word?), which eschews the 'monority of the week' tag it could effortlessly have settled for. For the most part, this deceptively slight film is markedly restrained, with director Noyce eliciting brave performances from his untrained leads. Granted, a poorly executed, sappy reunifiation scene between mother and daughters does, unfortunately, drain and unjustly cheapen some of the resonance held within the staggering final shot. Then again, it is based on a book by the protagonists' daughter, the most availably irrefutable outlook on 'what really happened'.Single irk aside, the simple, linear narrative trajectory should, strictly speaking, have lapsed (read: degenerated) into an empty, soporific morality tale or outraged, absurdly overwrought, vacuous polemic. It is heartening to suspect that there are a miniscule number of racially infused 'genre films' being made that can have a gratifying (but not gratuitous) emotional (dare I say 'uplifting', do not be put off by the word.... just this once) effect on an audience. Two minor key but worthy efforts from Philip 'Patriot Games' Noyce in quick succession? (the other being 'The Quiet American', based on a Graham Greene novel dating from the late fifties, which attempts to 'symbolically' lay bare the antecedents of the Vietnam War) Hmmm.

It is definitely not a proud chapter in Australia's history & the Government does not wish to sweep it under the carpet & forget about it simply.  Rather, we were taught of the nation's past, lest we forget & then, we can make sure that the Australia of the future shall never be the same again.  It's really unbelievable and inconceivable that the Government of that time really believed that the assimmilation program was the best thing that could happen to the half caste children.  The notion of freedom & individual rights is definitely not considered then.  The premise of the runaway girls to return to their home is both disturbing and moving at the same time, amid the vast & hostile landscape of Australia, and the police that were hot on their trails.  Kenneth Branagh was simply brilliant as the Protector of the Aborigines, who was also called the Devil by the children.  But the stars of the show would have to be those runaway girls who were so natural with their roles.  Noyce, the Director has proven that you don't need to have a big budget to create a powerful and poignant movie.

From 1931 to 1970, the aborigines were under the ""guardianship"" of a British bureaucrat, with the particular idea of separating ""half-caste"" aborigines from their full-blooded parents and putting them in a home so they could learn how to be servants and low-wage employees.We follow three girls (aged 8-14) who are separated from their homes and placed in this camp some 1200 miles away.  Molly, the oldest girl, who is quite clever and spirited, leads the three on a daring escape and journey back to their home.  Their journey is amazing, because the endure lengthy hardships in the desert, little food, and the treachery of some adults they meet who try to turn these famous refugees over to authorities.They do meet help along the way too, but always they have to be wary of anyone they run into.  The movie has flashes of humor, beautiful scenery and some heart-wrenching scenes.Kenneth Branagh plays Neville, the bureaucrat, and is the only ""star"" in the movie.  His part is quite small...he handles it well, but it is NOT his movie.  The movie belongs to these three inexperienced actresses, who were ""discovered"" by director Philip Noyce and put to work in these tricky parts.  And they pull it off so well.  They are all outstanding at conveying their sense of fear, of outrage, or courage and they have a certain stillness that shows how reserved they feel around these white strangers who have uprooted them.The movie is not exactly fast-paced, but I found it fascinating all the way through.  It quietly draws us in, because we are rooting for the lead characters.The fact that this is a TRUE story (we meet some of the main characters towards the end) makes it all the more riveting.  It's one of those rare films that completely educates you about an obscure but important part of history, but entirely through the power of great storytelling.  We never feel we are ""learning,"" yet at the end of the movie, you want to go find out more about this time in history.The movie is rated PG, but might not be very interesting to kids under 11 or so.  A recommended experience!(By the way, the bonus feature on the DVD about the making of the film is outstanding.

598382,A1XZJ32DJS8YV2,B00005JLD4,"R. M. Williams ""just an avid reader""","[1, 2]","The book is a straightforward telling of the story of the 3 girls walk, almost 2000 KM in about 9 weeks, eluding the police and obtaining food. Interestingly it starts with the first European's landing on the shores and the ancestors of the girls reactions. The reviews at amazon give a sufficient outline of the movie and i don't feel the need to repeat the details here.What i would like to discuss is the clash of cultures that underlies and animates the movie. The key scene in the policeman holding up the paper and removing the children from their mother's loving arms, to be placed in a heartless, cruel, impersonal, prison. Western culture several hundred years ago became structured, institutionalized, bureaucratic, impersonal. The aboriginal culture, for at least 60thousand years has remained close to the foundations of humanity: hunter-gatherers, minimal technology, minimal possessions. The words of the superintendent: &quot;Just because they use Neolithic tools doesn't mean that they have Neolithic brains.&quot; is the key element in this 'clash of cultures'. The conquest of Australia, like the destruction of native cultures in the Pacific and the Americas was done via germs and guns, (to partly quote an excellent book on the topic). It was the difference in the tools, in the things of these two different cultures that doomed the Aboriginals to the destruction of their long held way of life, not the ideas, not the humanity(or lack of it) of either group. And this is, to me, one of the paradoxes of the movie. The motivations of the institutionalizers was clearly not evil as much as wrongly directed. Yet the obvious evil that emerged from it must be explained not only as a result of massive impersonal institutions creating their own inertia, but in the deflection of human personalities, of human feelings in those institutions towards the goals of those institutions. Simply put, our tools shape their own results, despite our personal feelings or conscious intentions. That is even before the observation that people assume the fascade of their organizations, even before we realize that people are shaped and controlled by their institutions and their tools.So it is a story that starkly illustrates the collision of cultures in the type of tools each has purchased with the souls of the people inside. For despite the intentions and outspoken feelings of the white people involved they continued the brutal suppression and destruction of the Aboriginal culture and people through the heart-wrenching tearing away of their next generation. The movie and the book are on a very personal level, just one old lady relating what happened to her so many years ago, to us her audience. Yet even in this personal level the tools intervene, for the way home, the bread crumbs, the yellow brick road was the rabbit proof fence.European culture introduced the rabbits to Australia, to the extraordinary destruction of the native habitat and unique animals that exist there. All to create more rabbits at the destruction of the kangaroos, analogous to the western peoples invasion which substituted white human bodies for black. The rabbit proof fence was a typical western ideological tool to try to fix what never should have happened. More technology chasing the problems of more stupid decisions, round and round until the destructiveness of the whole package is obvious to even the meanest minded colonist. The fence never worked, the rabbits got through, technology failed, again. But the fence became a very specific thing in the minds of the Aboriginals, it was the way to come out of the wilderness where they lived their ancestrial ways and became the hangers-on of the white tool based culture. For the fence was the boundary between white and Aboriginal, between the hunter gatherer and the stationary monthly ration outback ranch way of life. And to the girls it was the way home.The movie, like the destruction of native cultures, is full of paradoxes like these. The powerlessness of young girls arraided against the full brute force of the police and their legal papers, the fact that they are 'half-caste' who grew up hated by the full aboriginal kids, then torn from that by their father's culture who only wanted to turn them into domestic slaves. We cheer for the girls, we distaint the Aboriginal tracker who deserts his own people for the service of the conquerers, we cry with the mothers as they strike their heads with rocks to mourn their children's kidnapping. But we might miss the big picture if we look at them as the only victims of the system, for the huge imposing edifice of Western police, military, courts, governments is just the iceberg-like tip of a culture that imposed tools between people, which dehumanizes and manipulates its inhabitants into believing that theirs is the best of all possible ways of living. This is the big picture, the Aboriginal way of life, the culture as a testimony that humanity has not always lived this way, that it is not necessarily the only way to express our common humanity, that there were alternatives in the recent past.

598383,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00005JLD4,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[3, 5]","Rabbit-Proof Fence (Phillip Noyes, 2002)If Rabbit-Proof Fence is not the best film of 2002, it's certainly within the top three, and missed 'best' by a short nose. Noyce, who is known for directing junk, not to put too fine a point on it,(Patriot Games, Sliver, Clear and Present Danger, et al), gives us his first good film since all the way back in 1989, when he took the boating scene from The Talented Mr. Ripley and turned it into the brilliant Dead Calm.Rabbit-Proof Fence is the story of three racially mixed girls, Molly (the hauntingly beautiful Everlyn Sampi in her screen debut, which has already garnered her at least one Best Actress nod), her sister Daisy (Tianna Sanbury, also a newcomer), and their cousin Gracie (Laura Monaghan, and you know the refrain by now). Pitted against them is, well, all of Australian white society, and a select few aborigines as well. The three girls are taken from their home in Jigalong and sent to the Moore River camp for girls, sort of a twisted Outback version of a finishing school for indentured servants. The head of the camp (and then, through the magic of cinema, the voice of Australian white society) is Neville 'the Devil,' played by Kenneth Branagh. Despite Neville's veneer of civility, and the complexity of his feelings for aborigines ('just because they use Neolithic tools does not mean they have Neolithic minds,' he says to an assistant at one point during the film), the girls see through this faade right quick and decide to walk home, a journey of some twelve hundred mile across the Australian outback. In order to do so, they have to follow the rabbit-proof fence of the film's title, erected in the outback to keep the plagues of (British-imported) rabbits away from the farmlands.The first fifteen minutes of Rabbit-Proof fence are some of the most difficult footage to watch ever filmed; Noyce's camera angles and rapid cuts are disturbingly effective during the scenes leading up to the removal of Molly and her cohorts. Horror film aficionados in the audience will immediately recognize the camerawork as a pastiche of trickery first pioneered by George A. Romero (the blindingly fast cuts are a trademark of Dawn of the Dead, and anyone who's ever seen night of the Living Dead will recognize the car-interior perspective of people beating on the windows from early in that film). So, perhaps, Noyce has learned something from his time in America. Too bad he didn't use it when making The Saint.The film calms down from there, but stays on an emotionally high pitch throughout even when the pace slows down. The last hour of the film almost has to be slow by definition; it's hard to keep a pace up when your main plot point is three girls walking for over a thousand miles.Perhaps the best thing about Rabbit-Proof fence is that Noyce doesn't take the easy way out and turn this into a road movie. The trek isn't used as an excuse for us to watch long scenes of the three girls bonding by firelight, nor are we given long intercut scenes of what's happening in the world around them (they pick up news of pursuit from people they encounter along the way, but cut scenes of their pursuers, and Neville's reaction to the continuing frustration of same, are kept mercifully short throughout). As a result, the movie runs barely over ninety minutes, which is just about what it should be. Noyce gives the material the necessary amount of time to tell the story, and not more.Absolutely stunning. A must-see film for those who rightly believe there's something wrong with the Academy's heads for nominating the tripe they did for the Academy Awards this year. **** ",5,First rival of The Ring for best film of 2002,1047254400,"03 10, 2003",2003,3639,"['Rabbit-Proof', 'Fence', 'Phillip', 'Noyes', '2002', 'Rabbit-Proof', 'Fence', 'not', 'best', 'film', '2002', 'certainly', 'top', 'three', 'missed', ""'best"", 'short', 'nose', 'Noyce', 'who', 'known', 'directing', 'junk', 'not', 'put', 'too', 'fine', 'point', 'Patriot', 'Games', 'Sliver', 'Clear', 'Present', 'Danger', 'et', 'al', 'first', 'good', 'film', 'way', 'back', '1989', 'when', 'took', 'boating', 'scene', 'Talented', 'Mr.', 'Ripley', 'turned', 'brilliant', 'Dead', 'Calm.Rabbit-Proof', 'Fence', 'story', 'three', 'racially', 'mixed', 'girls', 'Molly', 'hauntingly', 'beautiful', 'Everlyn', 'Sampi', 'screen', 'debut', 'already', 'garnered', 'least', 'one', 'Best', 'Actress', 'nod', 'sister', 'Daisy', 'Tianna', 'Sanbury', 'also', 'newcomer', 'cousin', 'Gracie', 'Laura', 'Monaghan', 'know', 'refrain', 'now', 'Pitted', 'well', 'Australian', 'white', 'society', 'select', 'few', 'aborigines', 'as', 'well', 'three', 'girls', 'are', 'taken', 'home', 'Jigalong', 'sent', 'Moore', 'River', 'camp', 'girls', 'sort', 'twisted', 'Outback', 'version', 'finishing', 'school', 'indentured', 'servants', 'head', 'camp', 'then', 'magic', 'cinema', 'voice', 'Australian', 'white', 'society', 'Neville', ""'the"", 'Devil', 'played', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'Neville', 'veneer', 'civility', 'complexity', 'feelings', 'aborigines', ""'just"", 'use', 'Neolithic', 'tools', 'not', 'mean', 'have', 'Neolithic', 'minds', 'assistant', 'one', 'point', 'film', 'girls', 'see', 'faade', 'right', 'quick', 'decide', 'walk', 'home', 'journey', 'twelve', 'hundred', 'mile', 'Australian', 'outback', 'order', 'do', 'so', 'have', 'follow', 'rabbit-proof', 'fence', 'film', 'title', 'erected', 'outback', 'keep', 'plagues', 'British-imported', 'away', 'farmlands.The', 'first', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'Rabbit-Proof', 'fence', 'are', 'most', 'difficult', 'footage', 'watch', 'ever', 'filmed', 'Noyce', 'camera', 'angles', 'rapid', 'cuts', 'are', 'disturbingly', 'effective', 'scenes', 'leading', 'up', 'removal', 'Molly', 'cohorts', 'Horror', 'film', 'aficionados', 'audience', 'will', 'immediately', 'recognize', 'camerawork', 'pastiche', 'trickery', 'first', 'pioneered', 'George', 'A.', 'Romero', 'blindingly', 'fast', 'cuts', 'are', 'trademark', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'seen', 'night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'will', 'recognize', 'car-interior', 'perspective', 'people', 'beating', 'windows', 'early', 'film', 'So', 'perhaps', 'Noyce', 'learned', 'something', 'time', 'America', 'Too', 'bad', 'did', ""n't"", 'use', 'when', 'making', 'Saint.The', 'film', 'calms', 'down', 'there', 'emotionally', 'high', 'pitch', 'even', 'when', 'pace', 'down', 'last', 'hour', 'film', 'almost', 'be', 'slow', 'definition', 'hard', 'keep', 'pace', 'up', 'when', 'main', 'plot', 'point', 'three', 'girls', 'walking', 'thousand', 'best', 'thing', 'Rabbit-Proof', 'fence', 'Noyce', ""n't"", 'take', 'easy', 'way', 'turn', 'road', 'movie', 'trek', ""n't"", 'used', 'excuse', 'watch', 'long', 'scenes', 'three', 'girls', 'bonding', 'firelight', 'are', 'given', 'long', 'intercut', 'scenes', 'what', 'happening', 'world', 'pick', 'up', 'news', 'pursuit', 'people', 'encounter', 'way', 'cut', 'scenes', 'pursuers', 'Neville', 'reaction', 'continuing', 'frustration', 'same', 'are', 'kept', 'mercifully', 'short', 'result', 'movie', 'barely', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'just', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'Noyce', 'material', 'necessary', 'amount', 'time', 'tell', 'story', 'not', 'more.Absolutely', 'stunning', 'must-see', 'film', 'who', 'rightly', 'believe', 'something', 'wrong', 'Academy', 'heads', 'nominating', 'tripe', 'did', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'year', '****']",Rabbit-Proof Fence
598384,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JLD4,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 3]","""Rabbit-Proof Fence"" provides a thrilling adventure tale, a fascinating historical document, and a stirring tribute to the strength and resiliency of the human spirit - all for the price of a single admission ticket (or rental fee).This true-life story is a classic case of racist imperialism run amuck.  As late as 1970, the white government in Australia believed it had solved the ""problem"" of what to do with all the half-caste children populating the country (a half-caste is the product of one parent who is white and the other aborigine).  The solution the leaders came up with was to simply take the children away from their parents, move the youngsters into government-run ""schools,"" then ""ease"" their way into the white population and culture.  The hope was that, through education and interbreeding, the aborigines would eventually be subsumed completely by the white race.  The most maddening and amazing aspect of this story is the fact that many of the people in charge of this policy genuinely believed that what they were doing was right, that they were actually enlightening the aborigines, improving their lot in life and rescuing them from a life of stone-aged hardship and ignorance - if only the natives could be made to see it for themselves!  It didn't seem to matter to these authorities that, in their efforts, they were violating the very foundation upon which civilized society is based: the sacred bond of the family.  Yet through the outrage of those characters who refuse to give into this notion, the film taps into that desire common to each and every one of us:  to be who we are and not what other people think we should be.The story takes place in 1931 when three young girls are ripped away from their homes and families and placed into a ""training camp"" run by the government.  Molly is the oldest of the three, a sensitive but fiery girl of twelve who decides to break out of their prison and lead her cousin and little sister across 1500 miles of scorching desert back to their native home.  Young Everlyn Sampi gives a stunning performance as Molly, a wide-eyed youngster driven by strength and determination to rescue the three of them from this gross miscarriage of justice.  Tianna Sansbury and Laura Monaghan do an equally beautiful job as her erstwhile mates who face a task far more daunting than most of us will ever have to confront.  Kenneth Branagh, in a relatively small but pivotal role as the government official in charge of all the nation's half-castes, manages to bring a touch of humanity to a character who could easily have slipped over into unmitigated villainy in the wrong actor's hands.  In a strange way, Branagh makes us see this character less as an odious creature and more as a misguided product of his culture, upbringing and time.Featuring expert direction by Philip Noyce and haunting music by Peter Gabriel, ""Rabbit-Proof Fence"" serves the same kind of salutary purpose for the present day Australians that a movie like ""One Potato, Two Potato"" (also about the problems faced by mixed race children) did for Americans in the 1960's.  ""Rabbit-Proof Fence"" provides Aussies with a chance to confront and repudiate a disreputable chapter in their recent past - something movies have proven very effective at doing in many different parts of the world.",4,eye-opening social drama,1069545600,"11 23, 2003",2003,3319,"['Rabbit-Proof', 'Fence', 'thrilling', 'adventure', 'tale', 'fascinating', 'historical', 'document', 'stirring', 'tribute', 'strength', 'resiliency', 'human', 'spirit', 'price', 'single', 'admission', 'ticket', 'rental', 'fee', 'true-life', 'story', 'classic', 'case', 'racist', 'imperialism', 'run', 'amuck', 'As', 'late', '1970', 'white', 'government', 'Australia', 'believed', 'had', 'solved', 'problem', 'what', 'do', 'half-caste', 'children', 'populating', 'country', 'half-caste', 'product', 'one', 'parent', 'who', 'white', 'other', 'aborigine', 'solution', 'leaders', 'came', 'up', 'was', 'simply', 'take', 'children', 'away', 'parents', 'move', 'youngsters', 'government-run', 'schools', 'then', 'ease', 'way', 'white', 'population', 'culture', 'hope', 'was', 'education', 'interbreeding', 'aborigines', 'would', 'eventually', 'be', 'subsumed', 'completely', 'white', 'race', 'most', 'maddening', 'amazing', 'aspect', 'story', 'fact', 'many', 'people', 'charge', 'policy', 'genuinely', 'believed', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'was', 'right', 'were', 'actually', 'enlightening', 'aborigines', 'improving', 'lot', 'life', 'rescuing', 'life', 'stone-aged', 'hardship', 'ignorance', 'only', 'natives', 'could', 'be', 'made', 'see', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'matter', 'authorities', 'efforts', 'were', 'violating', 'very', 'foundation', 'civilized', 'society', 'based', 'sacred', 'bond', 'family', 'outrage', 'characters', 'who', 'refuse', 'give', 'notion', 'film', 'desire', 'common', 'one', 'be', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'what', 'other', 'people', 'think', 'should', 'be.The', 'story', 'place', '1931', 'when', 'three', 'young', 'girls', 'are', 'ripped', 'away', 'homes', 'families', 'placed', 'training', 'camp', 'run', 'government', 'Molly', 'oldest', 'three', 'sensitive', 'fiery', 'girl', 'twelve', 'who', 'break', 'prison', 'lead', 'cousin', 'little', 'sister', '1500', 'miles', 'scorching', 'desert', 'back', 'native', 'home', 'Young', 'Everlyn', 'Sampi', 'stunning', 'performance', 'Molly', 'wide-eyed', 'youngster', 'driven', 'strength', 'determination', 'rescue', 'three', 'gross', 'miscarriage', 'justice', 'Tianna', 'Sansbury', 'Laura', 'Monaghan', 'do', 'equally', 'beautiful', 'job', 'erstwhile', 'mates', 'who', 'face', 'task', 'far', 'more', 'daunting', 'most', 'will', 'ever', 'have', 'confront', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'relatively', 'small', 'pivotal', 'role', 'government', 'official', 'charge', 'nation', 'half-castes', 'manages', 'bring', 'touch', 'humanity', 'character', 'who', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'slipped', 'unmitigated', 'villainy', 'wrong', 'actor', 'hands', 'strange', 'way', 'Branagh', 'see', 'character', 'odious', 'creature', 'more', 'misguided', 'product', 'culture', 'upbringing', 'time.Featuring', 'expert', 'direction', 'Philip', 'Noyce', 'haunting', 'music', 'Peter', 'Gabriel', 'Rabbit-Proof', 'Fence', 'same', 'kind', 'salutary', 'purpose', 'present', 'day', 'Australians', 'movie', 'One', 'Potato', 'Two', 'Potato', 'also', 'problems', 'faced', 'mixed', 'race', 'children', 'did', 'Americans', '1960', 'Rabbit-Proof', 'Fence', 'Aussies', 'chance', 'confront', 'repudiate', 'disreputable', 'chapter', 'recent', 'something', 'movies', 'have', 'proven', 'very', 'effective', 'doing', 'many', 'different', 'parts', 'world']",Rabbit-Proof Fence

598387,A38FLWJT9I4KQ1,B00005JLD4,San Diego Movie Critic,"[2, 3]","Overall this was a good movie about a disturbing subject.  Although I have no way of knowing if the facts of the movie are consistent with the true events, there was one critical thing that could have made this movie timeless.  What I am suggesting is that a brave director will at some point address the same subject (probably not the same story) with grit and realism.The problem with the movie:  These girls acoomplished an increadible feat which the movie does not come close to presenting.  However, the three young actors did a great job.  The viewer gets the impression that everyday there was a home or person available along their entire walk to feed them.  I'm guessing this was not the case.  The director needed to provide the viewer with a sense of time and distance traveled which I never felt.  Besides trying to avoid capture, the director gives you the impression that the only hardship occurred during a single day while walking through the desert when they collapsed only to be saved shortly after by the sight of a raptor.  I am sure it was not that easy.Lastly, although not related to the movie, I found it funny to see Kenneth Branagh's larger than life portrait on the cover of the DVD as if he was a primary character in the movie or contributed anything significant to the project.

598388,A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB,B00005JLD4,"Sarah ""Eat Dessert First""","[13, 14]","Phillip Noyce's ""Rabbit-Proof Fence"" is based on the true story of Daisy, Molly and Gracie, three half-caste children in Western Australia in 1931. The Australian government continued enforcing until 1970 a law that allowed mixed race children to be removed forcibly from their parents and sent to boarding schools to ""educate"" them for a white world. The girls were trained to be servants and domestics. The whole system was similar to the Indian schools in the United States, where First Nations children were sent to be raised as pious, productive, educated young adults, but the system there too frequently failed. The plan was that the half-caste girls would marry whites or other half-castes and have the Aboriginal ""bred out of them,"" as policy director A.O. Neville (Kenneth Branagh) explains to a local ladies' society.Daisy, Molly and Gracie are sent to the Moore River Native Settlement in Perth, over 2000 kilometres from their home in Jigalong Station. They do not last more than a few days before Molly, the ringleader, plans their escape through brush and desert, finding her way home by following the rabbit-proof fence, the longest in the world, that divides pasture from rabbit-infested bush. Neville and his men, including a skilled Aboriginal tracker, Moodoo (film veteran David Gulpilil) search for weeks in pursuit of the girls, and one is eventually recaptured in a harrowing scene, only steps from safety with the other girls.There is very little in the way of dialogue, and although Noyce's child actors are all unskilled, there are remarkable performances and true moments of fear, desperation, and grief shine through. The girls' mother and grandmother are particularly effective at conveying the mind-shattering grief they must live with knowing that they may never see their girls again. In one touching scene, at separate points on the fence, thousands of kilometres apart, both the mother and the girls tightly grip the fence, lightly shaking it, as if they could feel the resulting vibrations and sense the others' presence there.The cinematography shows off the dry palette of the desert, the spectacular desert sunsets, the shimmering wave of heat that covers the landscape. This film reminded me in some ways of the 1971 Australian film ""Walkabout,"" which starred Gulpilil as an Aboriginal teenager, and follows two white children that are stranded in the outback with only Gulpilil as a guide. The ""Rabbit-Proof Fence"" score by Peter Gabriel is low-key and appropriately tension-filled, meditative and mysterious at key moments, with wisps of Aboriginal chant and song woven into a lush synth background, and reminded me of the excellent soundtrack to Australian sci-fi series ""Ocean Girl"" by Garry McDonald and Laurie Stone. The narration at the beginning and end of the movie was the most powerful for me: the real-life Molly and Daisy, now old women in bright clothes that are startlingly out of place against the backdrop of the outback they slowly walk through, tell how the story ended. And that was the saddest truth of all.The included documentary ""Following the Rabbit-Proof Fence"" shows Noyce flying to remote outback communities looking for Aboriginal child actors, auditioning thousands of hopefuls before settling on the final three, Everlyn Sampi, Tianna Sansbury, and Laura Monaghan, as well as the emotional journey for the temperamental star and the harrowing experience of filming the girls' abduction at the hands of a white officer. Pretty much the whole cast and crew was in tears and shaken afterwards, forced to relive the crucial moment that defined the ""Stolen Generations:"" the theft from their mothers' arms, some never to be seen or heard from again.An excellent film that treats a little-known subject outside of Australia (and fairly unspoken within), with the fresh-faced innocence of children who beat the odds and found their way home across 2000 km of largely uninhabited, hostile terrain to the waiting arms of their family.",5,"""Rabbit-Proof Fence"" a harrowing tale of loss and courage",1053129600,"05 17, 2003",2003,3995,"['Phillip', 'Noyce', 'Rabbit-Proof', 'Fence', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Daisy', 'Molly', 'Gracie', 'three', 'half-caste', 'children', 'Western', 'Australia', '1931', 'Australian', 'government', 'continued', 'enforcing', '1970', 'law', 'allowed', 'mixed', 'race', 'children', 'be', 'removed', 'forcibly', 'parents', 'sent', 'boarding', 'schools', 'educate', 'white', 'world', 'girls', 'were', 'trained', 'be', 'servants', 'domestics', 'whole', 'system', 'was', 'similar', 'Indian', 'schools', 'United', 'States', 'where', 'First', 'Nations', 'children', 'were', 'sent', 'be', 'raised', 'pious', 'productive', 'educated', 'young', 'adults', 'system', 'there', 'too', 'frequently', 'failed', 'plan', 'was', 'half-caste', 'girls', 'would', 'marry', 'whites', 'other', 'half-castes', 'have', 'Aboriginal', 'bred', 'policy', 'director', 'A.O', 'Neville', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'local', 'ladies', 'society.Daisy', 'Molly', 'Gracie', 'are', 'sent', 'Moore', 'River', 'Native', 'Settlement', 'Perth', '2000', 'kilometres', 'home', 'Jigalong', 'Station', 'do', 'not', 'last', 'more', 'few', 'days', 'Molly', 'ringleader', 'escape', 'brush', 'desert', 'finding', 'way', 'home', 'following', 'rabbit-proof', 'fence', 'longest', 'world', 'pasture', 'rabbit-infested', 'bush', 'Neville', 'men', 'including', 'skilled', 'Aboriginal', 'tracker', 'Moodoo', 'film', 'veteran', 'David', 'Gulpilil', 'search', 'weeks', 'pursuit', 'girls', 'one', 'eventually', 'recaptured', 'harrowing', 'scene', 'only', 'safety', 'other', 'girls.There', 'very', 'little', 'way', 'dialogue', 'Noyce', 'child', 'actors', 'are', 'unskilled', 'are', 'remarkable', 'performances', 'true', 'moments', 'fear', 'desperation', 'grief', 'shine', 'girls', 'mother', 'grandmother', 'are', 'particularly', 'effective', 'conveying', 'mind-shattering', 'grief', 'must', 'live', 'knowing', 'may', 'never', 'see', 'girls', 'again', 'one', 'touching', 'scene', 'separate', 'points', 'fence', 'thousands', 'kilometres', 'apart', 'mother', 'girls', 'tightly', 'grip', 'fence', 'lightly', 'shaking', 'could', 'feel', 'resulting', 'vibrations', 'sense', 'others', 'presence', 'there.The', 'cinematography', 'dry', 'palette', 'desert', 'spectacular', 'desert', 'sunsets', 'shimmering', 'wave', 'heat', 'landscape', 'film', 'reminded', 'ways', '1971', 'Australian', 'film', 'starred', 'Gulpilil', 'Aboriginal', 'teenager', 'two', 'white', 'children', 'are', 'stranded', 'outback', 'only', 'Gulpilil', 'guide', 'Rabbit-Proof', 'Fence', 'score', 'Peter', 'Gabriel', 'low-key', 'appropriately', 'tension-filled', 'meditative', 'mysterious', 'key', 'moments', 'wisps', 'Aboriginal', 'chant', 'song', 'woven', 'lush', 'synth', 'background', 'reminded', 'excellent', 'soundtrack', 'Australian', 'sci-fi', 'series', 'Ocean', 'Girl', 'Garry', 'McDonald', 'Laurie', 'Stone', 'narration', 'beginning', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'most', 'powerful', 'real-life', 'Molly', 'Daisy', 'now', 'old', 'women', 'bright', 'clothes', 'are', 'startlingly', 'place', 'backdrop', 'outback', 'slowly', 'walk', 'tell', 'how', 'story', 'ended', 'was', 'saddest', 'truth', 'all.The', 'included', 'documentary', 'Following', 'Rabbit-Proof', 'Fence', 'shows', 'Noyce', 'flying', 'remote', 'outback', 'communities', 'looking', 'Aboriginal', 'child', 'actors', 'auditioning', 'thousands', 'hopefuls', 'settling', 'final', 'three', 'Everlyn', 'Sampi', 'Tianna', 'Sansbury', 'Laura', 'Monaghan', 'as', 'well', 'emotional', 'journey', 'temperamental', 'star', 'harrowing', 'experience', 'filming', 'girls', 'abduction', 'hands', 'white', 'officer', 'Pretty', 'much', 'whole', 'cast', 'crew', 'was', 'tears', 'shaken', 'afterwards', 'forced', 'relive', 'crucial', 'moment', 'defined', 'Stolen', 'Generations', 'theft', 'mothers', 'arms', 'never', 'be', 'seen', 'heard', 'again.An', 'excellent', 'film', 'little-known', 'subject', 'Australia', 'fairly', 'unspoken', 'fresh-faced', 'innocence', 'children', 'who', 'beat', 'odds', 'found', 'way', 'home', '2000', 'km', 'largely', 'uninhabited', 'hostile', 'terrain', 'waiting', 'arms', 'family']",Rabbit-Proof Fence

So much is similar that I wish there was more relationship between Australia's ""stolen generation"" and First Nations people who survived boarding schools and their descendants.Acting was top-notch from the three girls who had never before acted--particularly Everlyn Sampi, who is clearly a natural method-actor as the director says in the excellent making-of featurette on the DVD (which also includes a great commentary). The photography is gorgeous, really managing to capture the soul of the outback with respect and almost a sort of love.

Brilliant performances are given by first time actors for the roles of Molly Craig (Everlyn Sampi), little sister Daisy Craig (Tianna Sansbury), and cousin Gracie Fields (Laura Monoghan). Peter Gabriel receives a Golden Globe nomination for ""Best Original Score.""Based on a true story, ""Rabbit-Proof Fence"" is a powerful and poignant recount of three young Aboriginal girls who fall victim, in the early 1930's, to a government led initiative to purify `half-caste' children. Born out of `white man's' arrogance, the program is publicized as functioning for the betterment of the children. The supposition proposes that bi-racial (half-caste) Aborigine children are better off raised in white families. There, they will be sent to school and taught to live among white people.A supremacist minded politician, A. O. Neville (Kenneth Branagh) leads the charge in what is now known as ""the stolen generations,"" a phrase used to depict the result caused by barbaric acts of stripping children from their families, leaving behind their indigenous culture, and forcing new beliefs upon them.As the story unfolds, what the government officials do not count on is the determination and resourceful spirit of these three young girls and their overwhelming desire to return to their native families. The journey continues as they put their destiny into their own hands and face the biggest survival test of their young lives. First, they must escape from the Moore River Native Settlement where they are being held captive.When word arrives of the girls' escape, the Jigalong tribe turns to their sacred ways in hopes of evoking the spirit world to help bring them back home. Family members participate in rituals filled with ancient chants, rhythmic drumming, and meditation to call up strength, guidance, and protection for the long journey home. To get home, the girls will have to avoid being caught by skilled trackers, walk 1,500 miles over treacherous terrain, endure searing heat, thirst and hunger -- and the only thing they have to navigate by is a ""rabbit-proof fence.""Rabbit-Proof Fence.

An epic story that sees Molly one step ahead of the authorities at every turn, as she uses the rabbit proof fence that bisects the continent in this incredible journey home.ReviewThe strength of Rabbit Proof Fence comes through its ability to be both educational in its lessons of hidden history while at the same time reinforcing the human spirit and pathos that one can never loose hope under even the most extreme circumstances.The mood of the film is conveyed perfectly through the performance given by Everlyn Sampi, who was discovered after a national talent search on the Australian channel nine.  Her simple gestures and the power held within her eyes, as she leads her sisters on a journey of extremes is both a testament to herself and director Phillip Noyce.Noyce, a veteran of hits such as Clear and Present Danger and The Bone Collector, has had a successful career ""blowing stuff up in the sandpit that is Hollywood"" as he put it, though he has never really become a household name outside of his domestic Australian homeland.  This month the unsung helmer brings us two films: accompanying this is The Quiet American.  Needless to say Fence has his heart while the other satisfies his pocket.  Fence is a personal horror story for all Australians that until now has gone untold.  It brings to life Doris Pilkington's original novel that tells the story of her mother's courageous journey home.  The fence, while having its practical uses in stopping the rabbit population from ravaging crops, acts as a metaphor to us all:  For Molly it was the umbilical cord that allowed her to find her mother and her home, while on a secondary level it is showing the rest of the world the way to the truth - and through its symbolic status after the films release has reunited members of the stolen generation.The most successful film in Australia last year, it has already been nominated for 10 AFI awards and depending upon its marketing in the States, deserves worldwide recognition.  If ever a child star deserved an Oscar then Everlyn Sampi is a top candidate in my mind.  The only major downside to this film is that it has an odd pace and does occasionally feel likes its natural tempo is disrupted in order to give the narrative a kick start it doesn't need.  Maybe too many years in Hollywood are responsible, but one can't help but feel that this is a director at odds with his own styles:  A question of how much gloss does one use before the reality can no longer breath springs to mind!The VerdictThis is a beautiful film that is both mesmerising and finely acted.  If only it were slightly grittier, relying less on creating a point of view experience and had let the story speak for itself it would have been perfect.",4,IT MAY BREAK YOUR HEART,1073433600,"01 7, 2004",2004,3336,"['BriefThis', 'true', 'story', 'three', 'members', 'Stolen', 'Generation', 'Molly', 'Craig', 'young', 'Aboriginal', 'Girl', 'played', 'Everlyn', 'Sampi', 'younger', 'sister', 'cousin', 'escape', 'government', 'institution', 'set', 'up', 'part', 'policy', 'train', 'Aboriginal', 'children', 'domestic', 'workers', 'integrate', 'white', 'society', 'where', 'are', 'suitable', 'candidates', 'were', 'chosen', 'have', 'colour', 'bred', 'out', 'Escaping', 'camp', 'where', 'ethnic', 'cleansing', 'far', 'happier', 'face', 'front', 'one', 'was', 'Europe', 'time', 'companions', 'journey', '1,500', 'miles', 'epic', 'story', 'Molly', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'authorities', 'turn', 'rabbit', 'proof', 'fence', 'continent', 'incredible', 'journey', 'home.ReviewThe', 'strength', 'Rabbit', 'Proof', 'Fence', 'ability', 'be', 'educational', 'lessons', 'hidden', 'history', 'same', 'time', 'reinforcing', 'human', 'spirit', 'pathos', 'one', 'can', 'never', 'loose', 'hope', 'even', 'most', 'extreme', 'circumstances.The', 'mood', 'film', 'conveyed', 'perfectly', 'performance', 'given', 'Everlyn', 'Sampi', 'who', 'was', 'discovered', 'national', 'talent', 'search', 'Australian', 'channel', 'nine', 'simple', 'gestures', 'power', 'held', 'eyes', 'sisters', 'journey', 'extremes', 'testament', 'herself', 'director', 'Phillip', 'Noyce.Noyce', 'veteran', 'hits', 'such', 'Clear', 'Present', 'Danger', 'Bone', 'Collector', 'had', 'successful', 'career', 'blowing', 'stuff', 'up', 'sandpit', 'Hollywood', 'put', 'never', 'really', 'become', 'household', 'name', 'domestic', 'Australian', 'homeland', 'month', 'unsung', 'helmer', 'two', 'films', 'accompanying', 'Quiet', 'American', 'Needless', 'say', 'Fence', 'heart', 'other', 'satisfies', 'pocket', 'Fence', 'personal', 'horror', 'story', 'Australians', 'now', 'gone', 'untold', 'life', 'Doris', 'Pilkington', 'original', 'novel', 'story', 'mother', 'courageous', 'journey', 'home', 'fence', 'having', 'practical', 'uses', 'stopping', 'rabbit', 'population', 'ravaging', 'crops', 'metaphor', 'Molly', 'was', 'umbilical', 'cord', 'allowed', 'find', 'mother', 'home', 'secondary', 'level', 'showing', 'rest', 'world', 'way', 'truth', 'symbolic', 'status', 'films', 'release', 'reunited', 'members', 'stolen', 'generation.The', 'most', 'successful', 'film', 'Australia', 'last', 'year', 'already', 'been', 'nominated', '10', 'AFI', 'awards', 'depending', 'marketing', 'States', 'worldwide', 'recognition', 'ever', 'child', 'star', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'then', 'Everlyn', 'Sampi', 'top', 'candidate', 'mind', 'only', 'major', 'downside', 'film', 'odd', 'pace', 'occasionally', 'feel', 'likes', 'natural', 'tempo', 'disrupted', 'order', 'give', 'narrative', 'kick', 'start', ""n't"", 'need', 'Maybe', 'too', 'many', 'years', 'Hollywood', 'are', 'responsible', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'director', 'odds', 'own', 'styles', 'question', 'how', 'much', 'gloss', 'one', 'use', 'reality', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'breath', 'springs', 'mind', 'VerdictThis', 'beautiful', 'film', 'mesmerising', 'finely', 'acted', 'only', 'were', 'slightly', 'grittier', 'relying', 'less', 'creating', 'point', 'view', 'experience', 'had', 'let', 'story', 'speak', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'perfect']",Rabbit-Proof Fence

The account of Molly, Gracie, and Daisy would be over-the-top, if one did not realize that this was indeed a true story. In an effort to &quot;purify&quot; races and gradually eliminate the continent's aboriginal peoples (all under the guise of &quot;bettering their prospects&quot; -- yeah, right), a white organization ludicrously created for the &quot;Protection&quot; of natives ends up destroying lives, families, and an entire culture with the kind of systematic fervor and idiocy that can only emanate from racist bureacracies. The three children in question are brutally taken from their bush-dwelling mother to be &quot;re-programmed&quot; at a filthy outback concentration camp run by white-clad nun-types who force the children to sing English American Slave plantation songs. The girls escape and, led by the clever Molly, journey hundreds of treacherous miles on foot in a seemingly impossible attempt to reunite with their mother. The story consumed the Australian newspapers at the time and this adaptation wisely chooses reality over sentimentality. Its earthiness and even-handed direction are sadly lacking from most modern indie films. An absolute winner, from the Peter Gabriel score, to the performances, to the cinematography. Kenneth Branaugh does a grand job of making the viewer despise his character's very existence.

The movie has a very detail description of the intention of the Whilte Australians in the 30s to whiten all these children by removing them from their mothers, sending them to the training camps. The story depicted 3 girls running away from the camp and walked 1200 miles back home to reunite with their mother. The movie is very natural and touching that you will just be drawn inside the hearts of those girls, who has nothing but strong determination to go home and live a life they want. The movie also described the arrogance of the Whitle Australians until the 1970s, who tried every effort to justify their whitening process of this Stolen Generation. It is a very honest portray of the experience of Molly, who was unfortunately being forced into this generation and lived a wandering and heart breaking life due to this policy. It should be watched by all people so that we could learn to respect other people's life and culture as they are, instead of superimposing what we think is the best for them, for they might end up to be a curse of life for these people. This is a very touching and introspecting production that should not be missed. It does not attempt to achieve a melodramatic effect, but a simple honest reminder for respecting the aboriginals who are actually the native people who live on this island continent. Things haven't been really improved in Australian over the aboriginal issues, but this is a very good attempt to raise the conscious of people over the land that the White Australians conquered 200 years ago, and how much the mentality of some of these people have and have not changed.

598402,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JLD4,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 4]","This is a story that must be told again and again, from generation to generation.  In 1931, Australia, three aboriginal girls were taken away from their mothers, in order to be raised under the Christian educational system.  The most touching part of the story is, the three girls ran away from the institute, to walk back to their home, barefoot.  And the home was 1,500 miles away.You may find the story is incredible, but what is told is true (you will see that before the end credit rolls).  Because of the government's law that attempted to 'save' the aboriganl children, the three girls, Molly, Gracie, and Daisy were captured by force while playing in their village, to be sent to the special institute where the new educational rules were set for the aboriginal children.But Molly was not a girl to give up, so she and the two girls set out one of the hardest travels in the movie history -- to go back to their home, going 1,500 miles, barefoot.  The only guidance they could have was the rabbit proof fence (they made to prevent the imported rabbits from spreading westward), which would lead them to the destination.But the governental officer in charge A.O. Neville (Kenneth Branagh) soon starts to move.  An able tracker Moodoo follows thier route, reading the footprints on the ground.Can the three girls go back to their home?  The film tells us the simple, but moving story with a skilled storytell's voice, without making it too dramatic nor too lean.  Actually, it is suspeceful when it wants to, but when it does, it does not lose its authenticity at all.TWO GREAT POINTS about the film are its soundtrack music by Peter Gabriel, and the photography by Christopher Doyle.  The film together with their contributions unfolds like an epic against the marvelous backdrop of the nature in Australia.  And though three girls (all non-pro actors) are all convincing, it is Kenneth Branagh who really amazes us.  His character is a very believable one, a kind of person doing very atrocious things out of what he believes is pure good-will.  Branagh is very good when he does this sort of tricky job, as is seen in his portrayal of Nati officer in equally impressive 'The Conspirasy.'DIRECTOR PHILIP NOYCE (himself from Australia) is probably known for his two Jack Ryan films, one so-so shocker 'Bone Collector' or several awful thrillers like 'Sliver' and 'The Saint.'  Forget about his past records.  He is a good director if given a right material, and now he shows it again.",5,"Going Home: Three Girls' 1,500 Mile Journey in Australia",1098316800,"10 21, 2004",2004,2491,"['story', 'must', 'be', 'told', 'again', 'again', 'generation', 'generation', '1931', 'Australia', 'three', 'aboriginal', 'girls', 'were', 'taken', 'away', 'mothers', 'order', 'be', 'raised', 'Christian', 'educational', 'system', 'most', 'touching', 'part', 'story', 'three', 'girls', 'ran', 'away', 'institute', 'walk', 'back', 'home', 'barefoot', 'home', 'was', '1,500', 'miles', 'away.You', 'may', 'find', 'story', 'incredible', 'what', 'told', 'true', 'will', 'see', 'end', 'credit', 'rolls', 'government', 'law', 'attempted', ""'save"", 'aboriganl', 'children', 'three', 'girls', 'Molly', 'Gracie', 'Daisy', 'were', 'captured', 'force', 'playing', 'village', 'be', 'sent', 'special', 'institute', 'where', 'new', 'educational', 'rules', 'were', 'set', 'aboriginal', 'children.But', 'Molly', 'was', 'not', 'girl', 'give', 'up', 'two', 'girls', 'set', 'out', 'one', 'hardest', 'travels', 'movie', 'history', 'go', 'back', 'home', 'going', '1,500', 'miles', 'barefoot', 'only', 'guidance', 'could', 'have', 'was', 'rabbit', 'proof', 'fence', 'made', 'prevent', 'imported', 'rabbits', 'spreading', 'westward', 'would', 'lead', 'destination.But', 'governental', 'officer', 'charge', 'A.O', 'Neville', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'soon', 'move', 'able', 'tracker', 'Moodoo', 'thier', 'route', 'reading', 'footprints', 'ground.Can', 'three', 'girls', 'go', 'back', 'home', 'film', 'simple', 'moving', 'story', 'skilled', 'storytell', 'voice', 'making', 'too', 'dramatic', 'too', 'lean', 'Actually', 'suspeceful', 'when', 'when', 'not', 'lose', 'authenticity', 'all.TWO', 'GREAT', 'POINTS', 'film', 'are', 'soundtrack', 'music', 'Peter', 'Gabriel', 'photography', 'Christopher', 'Doyle', 'film', 'together', 'contributions', 'unfolds', 'epic', 'marvelous', 'backdrop', 'nature', 'Australia', 'three', 'girls', 'non-pro', 'actors', 'are', 'convincing', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'who', 'really', 'character', 'very', 'believable', 'one', 'kind', 'person', 'doing', 'very', 'atrocious', 'things', 'what', 'pure', 'good-will', 'Branagh', 'very', 'good', 'when', 'sort', 'tricky', 'job', 'seen', 'portrayal', 'Nati', 'officer', 'equally', 'impressive', 'Conspirasy', 'PHILIP', 'NOYCE', 'Australia', 'probably', 'known', 'two', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'films', 'one', 'so-so', 'shocker', ""'Bone"", 'Collector', 'several', 'awful', 'thrillers', ""'Sliver"", 'Saint', 'Forget', 'past', 'records', 'good', 'director', 'given', 'right', 'material', 'now', 'again']",Rabbit-Proof Fence
598403,A16IMM180JAOQU,B00005JLD4,Viewer,"[15, 20]","For a ""true story"", this movie contains a number of falsehoods.Almost every allegation in the film of the cruelty these girls then endured is likewise invented. The girls weren't transported in a dog-box, tossed on the back of a truck, or awoken each dawn at Moore River by a clubbing of the walls.They weren't forced to wear prison-style sacks, either. In fact, when Craig fled, her daughter says she wore ""two dresses, two pairs of calico bloomers and a coat"".The central deceit of this ""true story"" - that it was a racist crime to rescue these girls. So no one should object to a fatherless eight-year-old girl being married off to a grown man? Should children services today not uplift children at risk of similar abuse?Here are at least 10 falsehoods in the movie:1. The three girls Molly, Gracie and Daisy were not taken by surprise and removed by force from Jigalong. The violent removal scene in the film is entirely fictional. The girls' mothers knew beforehand they were to go with Constable Riggs and, without any protest, they reluctantly acquiesced in the removal. The girls left Jigalong on horseback, not locked in a motor car.2. The Western Australian Chief Protector, A.O. Neville, did not remove the girls as part of some government plan to ""breed out the colour"". Molly, aged 14, and Gracie, aged 11, were removed because they were having sex with the white fence workers who stopped at the Jigalong depot overnight. Fifteen years earlier, Molly's mother had done the same with a young English fence inspector, who soon moved on. At the time, in all Australian states, under-age white girls were removed for the same reason.3. Daisy, aged 8, was removed because she was betrothed to marry a full-blood Aboriginal man old enough to be her grandfather. In traditional Aboriginal society, girls this age could be married. They had sexual relations immediately. Daisy could be removed from Jigalong under the 1905 Aboriginal Act because she was a half-caste girl. Had she been a full-blood Aborigine she could not have been legally removed and would have had to go through with the marriage. The lay missionary Mary Bennett told the Moseley Royal Commission in 1934 that if full-blood girls who married at this age conceived, the babies always died either before or during childbirth, and the child mother often died with them.Neville told the 1936 Moseley Royal Commission into the treatment of Aborigines: ""The children who have been removed as wards of the Chief Protector have been removed because I desired to be satisfied that the conditions surrounding their upbringing were satisfactory, which they certainly were not ... ""What concerned Neville was their welfare - which is precisely what concerns people today still about such children, and has more children removed today than Neville ever did.4. The speech in the film to a Perth ladies charity society by actor Kenneth Branagh, playing A.O. Neville, was never made by the real Neville. The words did not come from a transcript found in any historical archive but were created for the film by screenwriter Christine Olsen.5. When the girls were removed in 1931, Neville did not have control over the marriages of all the Aborigines in the state. The Western Australian government never gave him either the legal authority or the funding to manage Aboriginal people's affairs in the way the film alleges.6. The Moore River Settlement was not an institution solely for children, as the film depicts. It was a welfare settlement for Aborigines of all ages. Most of its children went there with their parents. When the three girls arrived in 1931, unaccompanied children were in a minority, comprising only 64 of the 400 inhabitants. Between 1915 and 1940, an average of only ten unaccompanied children a year were sent to Moore River. In 1931, Molly, Gracie and Daisy were three of only four children in the whole state sent there, out of an Aboriginal population of 29,000.7. The Moore River Settlement was not, as the film portrays it, a prison. Most Aboriginal people went there voluntarily and temporarily to gain access to welfare. Between 1930 and 1934 Moore River admitted 1067 people, but over the same period 1030 people left.8. On their great trek home, the girls were not pursued by a sympathetic black tracker.9. They did not receive any help along the way from a sexually-exploited Aboriginal domestic servant.10. They did not cross the north-western desert unassisted, nearly perishing in the process. The girls were eventually brought home to Jigalong by a white cattle station contractor, riding on his camels.",2,Misleading Propaganda,1335139200,"04 23, 2012",2012,4600,"['true', 'story', 'movie',

This film is just another example of the world's great racial divide and brings to light the much ignored history of Aboriginal people.Director Phillip Noyce has created a simple movie with a huge impact. He used real Aboriginal actors and managed to get a mountain of emotion out of the eyes of the three young girls that the movie centers around, Everlyn Sampi, Tianna Sansbury and Laura Monaghan. The story is based upon a true tale written by one of the central character's children. It begins happily with a beautiful family of Aborigines who exist in Australia during the 1930's, they live off the land in a peaceful existence until the white society decides that the ""black"" needs to be blended into the white race and eliminated, hints of Nazism invade here. Camps are set up and girls are captured to be trained and blended into the ""supreme"" white society without a care, almost as if they were merely cattle and not actual human beings.The majority of the film is spent following the three girls through their escape from the camps and into the desert. It is adventurous, thrilling and often horribly sad. The girls encounter people along the way who see them as human and some help is offered through crusts of bread and warm coats. They follow a fence line to find their way back home and end up traveling for nine weeks and over about 1,500 miles. The ending is beautifully touching and well worth the adventure.I learned something new from this film. I was never aware of what white society tried to do to the Aborigines, yet another horrid aspect of racism not taught in average schools. It seems that Australia committed atrocities towards the Aborigines well through the 1970's and possibly even to this day to some extent. While I am constantly disappointed by humanity and its constant desire to separate the races I was not disappointed in this film. It is a beautiful and heroic saga about the human spirit and the struggle for personal freedom.

So often these are thrown onto a DVD as a ""bonus"", but amount to nothing more than a refried re-telling of the film. Here, instead, we are treated to forty-five minutes of how Philip Noyce selected his three young actresses, and all the trials and tribulations that entailed. The scene in the film of the three children being taken from their mothers is a very heart-wrenching scene. But, moving beyond compare is that same scene as caught by the ""making of"" cameras during and after the shoot. Many of the people behind the cameras were in tears during the actual filming of the scene. At the end of the scene, the character mothers are on the ground crying and Noyce yells, ""CUT!"". He looks down and you can hear the actresses still crying. He looks up and around the camera with a puzzled look on his face to see if perhaps the actresses did not hear him yell, ""CUT"". They are all still on the ground sobbing, and he has to go over to console them, saying ""Woa, Woa, Woa..."" to calm them down and bring them out of it because everyone was so drawn into the event they were reenacting they forgot they were only filming a scene. That was very moving to see how the girls and women were so affected by the filming of that scene.

Unhappy in the camp they are sent to, the girls escape, outsmarting all of the trackers following them.  Their road to cross the 1200 miles of Australian Outback was a fence to keep rabbits from destroying farmland.  Through all of their adventures, they eventually made it home.  This was based on a true story.The story was okay.  The only problem was that the movie dragged out and seemed to go on forever.  I was very suprized that it was only 90 minutes long.  The director used cool camera angles, but they got kind of annoying after a while.  The soundtrack was composed by Peter Gabriel, and it was just plain scary.  It was mostly buzzing noises of bugs, and more often than not, drowned out the dialog that was going on.The best part of the DVD in my opinion was the documentary about the making of the movie.

It makes you want to slink away into the jungle and mayhaps emerge on the other side and with any luck, all the bad things we have wrought, will have vanished!But, as docudrama's unfold we are again brought to the fore to witness yet another crime against each other. Rabbit-Proof Fence is such a docudrama, as we see the gov't of Australia take half white aboriginal children away from their mothers arms and send them off to schools to be taught to be domestics and to be parterned with other breeds to cull out the aborigine blood in three generations. The great men who thought this up would have fit in with Hitler like a glove.  And to think that this program did not end until 1970s is beyond belief. And the present government of Australia does not offer any condolences for the program.The people of this offensive program were and are referred to as 'The Stolen Generation'Molly and Gracie are sisters and one day they are snatched away from their mother by the police like animals and along with their cousin Gracie. They are taken hundreds of miles away to be trained as domestics, and to enter a breeding program to retrieve all the white genes and breed the aboriginal gene's out. Kenneth Branagh is Dr. Neville and in charge of the program and you will not like him very much. All the children at the camp call him ""Dr. Devil."" The girls escape and trek some 1300-1500 miles back to their ancestral village, their ages are 14, 8, and 10. Molly remembers someone saying that the rabbit fence at their home runs the from coast to coast and they head for the outback in hopes of finding that fence. They meet some people along the way who are nice to them and head them to the fence. There is a hunt for them and no one can imagine how they have made it 600 miles away, but they cannot catch them. Every trap they set the girls get away.Molly's mother hears of her daughter journey and she and the grandmother set up a vigilance at the rabbit fence and meditate and sing a mantra and wait for the girls to return.There are some scary moments and the girls have much hardships.
