One thing I learned is that loving a dog as if the dog were a human is first a diservice to the dog and second an act of selfish neediness on the dog owner's part. Dogs have dog needs, Cesar Millan shows, and by giving the dog boundaries and discipline, rather than indulging the dog like a spoiled princess, the dog owner actually makes the dog more happy.I give Cesar Millan credit for raising our consciousness about dogs, and pets in general, and in this sense Millan is a great humanitarian.",5,"Learning to Treat Dogs Like Dogs, Not Humans",1157155200,"09 2, 2006",2006,859,"['Cesar', 'Millan', 'authentic', 'love', 'dogs', 'series', 'where', 'people', 'dogs', 'have', 'behavioral', 'problems', 'biting', 'over-aggression', 'depression', 'anxiety', 'chronic', 'barking', 'refusal', 'go', 'walks', 'refusal', 'submit', 'owner', 'name', 'few', 'Cesar', 'dog', 'owners', 'how', 'instil', 'discipline', 'consistency', 'mastery', 'dogs', 'One', 'thing', 'learned', 'loving', 'dog', 'dog', 'were', 'human', 'first', 'diservice', 'dog', 'second', 'act', 'selfish', 'neediness', 'dog', 'owner', 'part', 'Dogs', 'have', 'dog', 'needs', 'Cesar', 'Millan', 'giving', 'dog', 'boundaries', 'discipline', 'rather', 'indulging', 'dog', 'spoiled', 'princess', 'dog', 'owner', 'actually', 'dog', 'more', 'happy.I', 'give', 'Cesar', 'Millan', 'credit', 'raising', 'consciousness', 'dogs', 'pets', 'general', 'sense', 'Millan', 'great', 'humanitarian']",N/A

He presents it in a very understandable way though on TV.I noted he was very specific on ""putting out the calm, assertive energy"" --which some of Millan's book readers took literally & grew angry that he didn't explain how to grow that ""magic energy"" or whatever... He means carry your face, hands, body & voice in a very calm, quiet, assertive manner, like a top executive, not like a scared, shivering little girl, or an aggressive mean Tasmanian Devil, or a Flapping Bozo the Clown. Note this works on people too.I wholeheartedly agree on exercise working like Dog (& human) Prozac, and it creates a more manageable dog. 4H, again! It also works to control anxiety & concentration in humans & animals.I never thought about dog backpacks and have HUGE hopes for it. I'd been trying to think of something that'd wear them down a bit. Currently, I have to struggle and fight my way to the 4th lap around the block---by then, they are much calmer & easier to walk. They are easy to walk by themselves, but maybe that pack mentality makes them nutso together. If I leave one at home, he screams, jumps on the window.On one show, he had the dog pull a skateboarder or roller-skating person.

In fact, several of the dogs on his show have bitten holes in his hands but he never, never reacts in a way that is painful to the dog. He maintains his calm assertive self.Cesar's corrections consist of a noise ""shhhh"" and a brief tug on the leash. Cesar works with the type of collar the owner has on the dog. That may be buckle, choke, martingale, or pinch/prong. None of Cesar's corrections are physically damaging to the dog. Incidentally, the prong/pinch collar is not a cruel device when used correctly. It is meant as a TRAINING AID, to be used for no more than 2 weeks to help gain control of larger dogs that need help mastering leash etiquette. A person should ALWAYS consult a professional trainer for information on the proper use of pinch/prong collars. Shock collars should never be used unless they are set on a ""beep"" only setting and under the supervision of a professional.Please, if you own a dog, watch this show! This DVD set is filled with valuable information about canines and our relationship with them. Cesar gives good information in a no nonsense way that anyone can follow.

972201,AOL6BG6SAFGQF,B000EGDALQ,Rufus Quail,"[4, 4]","I don't have a dog, nor do I think of myself as a dog lover.  Yet, for my money ""The Dog Whisperer"" is one of the finest television programs ever produced.  It is sheer genius on many levels.  To name a few:  The photography and editing, the music, the blend of serious issues and  light-hearted fun, and of course Cesar himself, as unlikely a TV host as you can imagine.I love the way the camera captures the wacky antics of the dogs, accompanied by a whimsical musical score.  I would like to know who selects the music because so often it is brilliant.I think National Geographic took a chance with Cesar.  They could have made a conventional choice and used an experienced, polished host while having Cesar as the show's main character.  Thankfully, they decided to produce an unconventional, trailblazing kind of show.Clearly English is Cesar's second language and at best he abandoned his ESL studies early on.  He mangles the language at every turn, and yet he's eloquent and well-spoken when expounding on his life's passion.  Cesar's personality shines through at all times.  He seems like such a likeable, saintly guy.  He sports a Caesar Romero pencil-thin moustache and has a captivating twinkle in his eyes.It's compelling to watch someone with a gift work his magic, the way you can appreciate Tiger Woods without knowing a thing about golf.  I once saw a horse whispering demonstration by the legendary Monty Roberts, another saintly fellow.  Roberts has made a life's work not only of straightening out troubled horses, he works with troubled youngsters.  Watching their work you are grateful for the positive energy they are bringing into the world.  How about Cesar or Monty for the Nobel Peace Prize?In this collection, you get to binge on 26 episodes of doggie doings.  The show's participants are well-chosen to demonstrate that dog owners are as amusing as their charges.  You get to peek into the lives of some well-to-do dog owners who enjoy all the benefits of the American dream save one little shortcoming:  neurotic canines.  Then there was the 30-something nerd, still living with his mama, who wanted his dog to learn some manners to facilitate his meeting single women.Cesar is a man of mystery.  In one episode we get a quick look at Cesar at home with the kids and his wife, Illusion (were her parents hippies?).  I was startled at Cesar's modest lifestyle.  Why is he living so far below his means?One of the bonus features is Cesar spending 10 minutes with a Great Dane puppy that is afraid to walk on a shiny linoleum floor.  A collection of out-takes apparently was added to fill up another disk.  Buy, hey, it's Cesar, so I watched them all.  In one, you see how Cesar handles himself on a skate board.
