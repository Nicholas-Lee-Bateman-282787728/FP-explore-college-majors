Gjeny ""Princess G""","[4, 4]","I have been feeding a family of crows on my side yard for several years now, and can attest to their intelligence and sociability.  I started rewarding them with food when they started to chase the hawks away from my bird feeder whenever the latter came around. We came to a bargain: I would provide regular snacks - and they would keep the hawks away. I started to mimic their calls and after about a year they will generally come quickly now (in a couple of minutes) when I call then. Likewise, they will call to let me know that they're outside and would like some food. Since we no longer have a dog(s), I have found the crows to be good eaters of leftovers, so they now *help* in disposing of items from my regular cleaning out of the fridge.They particularly like french fries (preferably w/ketchup) and pasta (w/red sauce). (Of course they like meat but we are vegetarians so they're mostly out of luck in that regard. Like some children, they're not big on eating vegetables!)This is a good film to introduce people to crows' intelligence and ability, and especially to let people know that animals in general also have intelligence of their own. Once upon a time (as virtually all fairy tales/legends tell) we human beings had much closer relationships with the animals we share this earth with. We lost much of that when we moved from agrarian to industrialized societies. But the animals are still there, and still willing to listen and relate to/with us - if we are interested in giving them the chance.This might be a great film, along with the Hutto one on turkeys, for a teen who may be interested in pursuing a career in wildlife studies.",5,On Behalf of My Crow Friends,1325116800,"12 29, 2011",2011,1654,"['have', 'been', 'feeding', 'family', 'crows', 'side', 'yard', 'several', 'years', 'now', 'can', 'attest', 'intelligence', 'sociability', 'started', 'rewarding', 'food', 'when', 'started', 'chase', 'hawks', 'away', 'bird', 'feeder', 'whenever', 'latter', 'came', 'around', 'came', 'bargain', 'would', 'provide', 'regular', 'snacks', 'would', 'keep', 'hawks', 'away', 'started', 'mimic', 'calls', 'year', 'will', 'generally', 'come', 'quickly', 'now', 'couple', 'minutes', 'when', 'call', 'then', 'Likewise', 'will', 'call', 'let', 'know', ""'re"", 'outside', 'would', 'like', 'food', 'no', 'longer', 'have', 'dog', 's', 'have', 'found', 'crows', 'be', 'good', 'eaters', 'leftovers', 'now', '*help*', 'disposing', 'items', 'regular', 'cleaning', 'fridge.They', 'particularly', 'french', 'fries', 'preferably', 'w/ketchup', 'pasta', 'w/red', 'sauce', 'course', 'like', 'meat', 'are', 'vegetarians', ""'re"", 'mostly', 'luck', 'regard', 'children', ""'re"", 'not', 'big', 'eating', 'vegetables', 'good', 'film', 'introduce', 'people', 'crows', 'intelligence', 'ability', 'especially', 'let', 'people', 'know', 'animals', 'general', 'also', 'have', 'intelligence', 'own', 'Once', 'time', 'virtually', 'fairy', 'tales/legends', 'tell', 'human', 'beings', 'had', 'much', 'closer', 'relationships', 'animals', 'share', 'earth', 'lost', 'much', 'when', 'moved', 'agrarian', 'industrialized', 'societies', 'animals', 'are', 'still', 'there', 'still', 'willing', 'listen', 'relate', 'to/with', 'are', 'interested', 'giving', 'chance.This', 'might', 'be', 'great', 'film', 'Hutto', 'one', 'turkeys', 'teen', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'interested', 'pursuing', 'career', 'wildlife', 'studies']",N/A
1384745,A3HYA534VB3F2S,B00443FMIO,"Althetrainer ""Al""","[8, 8]","Our fascination with corvids began, this late spring, when we rescued 4 magpie chicks from some murderous crows. At that point we really thought magpies were the underdogs and crows, bullies.  But as we started reading about corvids we began to realize how closely the two birds were related to each other.  We observed them every day for 3 months, they are truly amazing! I am sure there are plenty people out there believe corvids are nothing but pesky creatures.  Only if they understood how intelligent these birds really are.This documentary film is very well done but a bit too short for its purpose.  I have to agree with one other reviewer who stated that the experiment in the film seemed inconclusive.  However, the flaw does not lie in the experiment but the film itself.  The mask experiment was actually a lot more extensive and it lasted much longer than what the film shows us.  Not only the experiment included random subjects (people) who wore masks on and off but some of the masks were also modified to test the crows cognitive ability.  At one point the caveman's mask was wore upside down yet the crows still recognized it and treated it as a threat.  If you are interested in reading about these experiments and learn how the authors came up with all other conclusions you may want to read the book ""Gifts of the Crow"". There are many stories and accounts (even brain anatomy and chemistry) in this book to explain why crows deserve the title ""feathered apes"".  One of the co-authors to ""Gifts of the Crow"", John Marzluff, is also behind this wonderful documentary.  If the movie seems a bit confusing, the book will draw you a much clearer picture.I would like the film even better if it was a bit longer.  In that case, a lot more information could be developed as a result less confusion.  Imagine trying to make a 2-hour movie based on the entire Harry Potter series; it's inevitably that some details will have to be sacrificed in order to keep the film in predetermined length.Overall I enjoy this short documentary.  The filming was nicely done and the narrator was engaging.

1384747,A11OTLEDSW8ZXD,B00443FMIO,CGScammell,"[59, 65]","The title of this short documentary refers to the high mortality of wild crows from a variety of reasons:  predators, car crashes, diseases, extreme weather, people shooting at them.  Only 40% of hatchlings make it to their first year, another 50% don't see their second birthday.  Crows can recognize a face out of a crowd, especially the ones who have been enemies of the crows, and tell the rest of their flock who the bad guys are. Thus the title of this work.This 52-minute-long documentary is about behaviorial experiments several ornithologists from the U of Washington (UoW)in Seattle and the Konrad Lorenze Institut in Austria have been conducting to prove the intelligence of these fascinating birds.  One of these researchers, John Marsluff, is a wildlife biologist at UoW who provides most of the scientific data.  Crows are smart, highly sociable, opportunistic, grieve for their dead partners, ""scold"" passersby and learn from other crows.  They are grossly misunderstood.  They communicate within their flocks, have over 250 distinct crow calls and are very territorial.  They can remember a face for up to two years.  Although they don't have the largest brains in the bird world, they are the most intelligent of all birds and have benefitted from evolutionary intelligence.The Seattle ornithologists show the viewing audience the unique ""tricks"" crows can do, including recording the antics of a crow sibling pair, White Wing and her brother, who are followed around via radio transmitter for the first year to record their behavior.  This team walks around the UoW campus wearing spooky-looking full-face masks during the experiments which probably had passersby watching the film crew wondering what was going on.This is narrated by Nora Young, a soft and feminine voice that is accompanied by violin music whenever the scientists aren't speaking about their subject matter.A lot of stuff mentioned in this documentary has already been extensively written about by Berndt Heinrich in his books on birds as well ""Mind of a Raven"" and ""Ravens in Winter,"" books I highly recommend to anyone who wants to read more about crows and ravens.Although this short documentary may not win any awards for cinematography, this is an interesting and enjoyable documentary for any bird or crow lover.  I'd wish it were another hour longer, though.  By the end of the documentary I was becoming attached to the crow subjects.

Anyone who's been around crows for a while, who observes them observing us, knows just how smart they are, despite the size of their brains.  The researchers seems puzzled by this, but it should give them food for thought that brain size isn't everything when it comes to intelligence and smarts.They followed some mated crows, tagging their fledglings (climbing up in the dangerous heights of a tree to do so) to be able to find them later and test their reactions to some cavemen-like masks that they had been exposed to while very young.  The parent crows had been taught to expect danger from the people wearing these masks and they were trying to see if this knowledge had been passed down to the young.One bird in particular was fascinating and you just fell in love with her--White Wing, named for the streaks of white in her feathers.Just how truly smart crows are came across through this show, how they might even be smarter than the primates who are the closest relations to humans.  Not that crow intelligence is exactly like human intelligence, but they can problem-solve as well as, if not better, than human children.I wish this program had been longer.

It then flew back up to the top of an adjacent telephone pole and silently stared down at me.  Ever since this experience, I've considered crows to be a rather ""cheeky"" and interesting creature.  Many people consider these birds to be annoying pests, but I've always liked them.  Perhaps more than anything, I've enjoyed the mystique and superstition that has surrounded these animals since time immemorial.  Thus, when I saw the PBS special MURDER OF CROWS available on DVD, I knew that I'd want to watch it.Overall, I enjoyed the documentary.  It was interesting to learn that crows have the ability to recognize specific faces and voices, and that certain crow species create and use tools to procure food.  One researcher even referred to them as ""apes with feathers""-- I liked that quote.  I've always known that crows are intelligent and tenacious animals; this documentary shows just how intelligent and cognizant these creatures really are.That being said, however, I have to admit that the documentary was rather dry and largely matter-of-fact.  I was hoping that they would also discuss more of the rich mythological history of the animal through the ages, pop cultural references, etc. (They make a brief mention about crows being portrayed as ""trickster"" sorts of characters in Native American cultures, as well as a couple of other minimal social/cultural references, but that's about it).I loved the idea of MURDER OF CROWS, but it could have been done much better.
