I have no idea what Sun Kissed is ""about"": whether Leo and Teddy are one person, or two, or none; whether this is a coming out story or a psychological allegory or a murder mystery, or all three, or something else; whether anybody was murdered or when; whether anything in this movie actually happened or not. I don't know, and I don't care.I happen to love movies like this, that defy understanding, that force me either to accept them on their own terms and see if I can enjoy them, or reject them. I gave Sun Kissed a chance, and I'm very glad I did.I understood nothing, and I enjoyed every second, from the first frame to the last note in the dark. I don't know what it was, and I don't know why, but I sure did like it.

The non-linear plot line meanders, crisscrossing, doubling back on time and space.  The premise of the plot may or may not be true; the characters may or may not exist; the nightmares may be recollections or hallucinations.

The songs (or maybe it's the same song) that pop up about every five minutes, are bad.  Worst aspect of all is the grainy photography, which makes it almost painful to watch the thing.Maybe things got better as the movie progressed, but I could only stand about thirty minutes.  After the second (or was it the third) time our hero started dancing in drag I gave up.Great things can be made on a small budget.
