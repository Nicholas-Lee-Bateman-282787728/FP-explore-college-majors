This movie, however, was a good one.It is not gay-themed in the same way that Beautiful Thing, Get Real or Trick is.  It is more similar to The Hanging Garden.  Like The Hanging Garden, it is complex and multi-layered though not quite as much.  It focuses on many issues at once and the ending would make a good topic for conversation.  Nobody wins and nobody loses entirely though everyone loses something. The viewer is also reminded that an act of revenge is never as sweet as the thought of revenge.My favorite character is Rachel but all the acting was pretty good. In the first part of the movie, the Alex character was a bit over the edge but I grew to like her much more at the end.There are some technical difficulties with sound but they are not insurmountable.Overall, a good movie.  Not a feel-good movie but a good one just the same.",4,This was a good one...,1000425600,"09 14, 2001",2001,932,"['So', 'many', 'gay', 'themed', 'movies', 'are', 'bad', 'are', 'so', 'poorly', 'made', 'are', 'hard', 'watch', 'movie', 'however', 'was', 'good', 'one.It', 'not', 'gay-themed', 'same', 'way', 'Beautiful', 'Thing', 'Get', 'Real', 'Trick', 'more', 'similar', 'Hanging', 'Garden', 'Hanging', 'Garden', 'complex', 'multi-layered', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'much', 'many', 'issues', 'once', 'ending', 'would', 'make', 'good', 'topic', 'conversation', 'Nobody', 'wins', 'nobody', 'entirely', 'everyone', 'something', 'viewer', 'also', 'reminded', 'act', 'revenge', 'never', 'as', 'sweet', 'thought', 'revenge.My', 'favorite', 'character', 'Rachel', 'acting', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'first', 'part', 'movie', 'Alex', 'character', 'was', 'bit', 'edge', 'grew', 'like', 'much', 'more', 'are', 'technical', 'difficulties', 'sound', 'are', 'not', 'insurmountable.Overall', 'good', 'movie', 'Not', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'good', 'one', 'just', 'same']",N/A

First we have the innocent couple debating telling folks that they are engaged.  Then we have the sexy troublemaker rambling on at dinner about how eating meat is a sexist evil perpetuated by the partiarchy, next is the overly dramatic girl with self esteem issues that is horrifically poorly acted to the point that you cannot tell if she is an escaped mental patient or just somebody who likes whinning in a babyish voice.  Basically the plot of the movie wasn't too bad and it would have made a fun short film, say...20 minutes. The problem was in trying to show us how clever some of the characters were it passed the point of sardonic or tongue in cheek to merely self indulgent and boring.

579692,A8QG61LYK0XO1,B00005B1WL,JUST A REVIEWER2,"[0, 0]","For what has, to me, turned out to be a good little film that just could NOT develop a following, it's surprising how often I pull it from my quite large DVD collection and take it for a ""Spin."" From a gay romantic angle (of much interest to me), it is definitely no ""Just A Question Of Love"" or ""Shelter"" or even ""Boy Culture."" No, romance is not the main focus of this little work. What we have, instead, is the individual performance of each ensemble player lifting this production to a sum which is more than a total of its (well, actually their) parts. And, frankly, this is unexpected since, with the exception of Heather Goldenhersh (Rachel), the remainder of our lead cast of five have little to show in the way of both pre- and follow on starring-in work. Be that as it may, this cast ""clicked"" in their work as individual characters and in their interplay with one another.My positive review at this late date won't do anything particularly worthwhile for this film and its place in movie history (yes, I'm bad for not acting sooner). BUT......if you're not a homophobe (look it up), and are considering a film rental or a new/used purchase, I'd say you probably won't go wrong giving it a try (plus I'd predict a not long availability life for this DVD in future).PS: As two other Customer Reviewers have mentioned, the DVD Special Features ""Director/Writers Commentary"" is both revealing and witty. In it you will learn, for example, how puzzling it was to set up the male/male anal sex, lovemaking scene. Apparently no one on set seemed to know (yeah, sure) a suitable ""alignment"" for the ""top"" and ""bottom actors. The resulting face-to-face (missionary), legs fully extended position which was shot might have been more ascetically (or Ratings) acceptable, but....come on guys....having the bottom's legs at least bent at the knees, or even better, locked at the ankles over the top's backside, would have at least lent some realism. Still, can't say this shot's outcome isn't romantic; it is that.****",4,Life is a Spin......And not just of a bottle........,1278374400,"07 6, 2010",2010,2016,"['what', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'good', 'little', 'film', 'just', 'could', 'NOT', 'develop', 'following', 'surprising', 'how', 'often', 'pull', 'quite', 'large', 'DVD', 'collection', 'take', 'Spin', 'gay', 'romantic', 'angle', 'much', 'interest', 'definitely', 'Just', 'Question', 'Love', 'Shelter', 'even', 'Boy', 'Culture', 'No', 'romance', 'not', 'main', 'focus', 'little', 'work', 'What', 'have', 'instead', 'individual', 'performance', 'ensemble', 'player', 'lifting', 'production', 'sum', 'more', 'total', 'well', 'actually', 'parts', 'frankly', 'unexpected', 'exception', 'Heather', 'Goldenhersh', 'Rachel', 'remainder', 'lead', 'cast', 'five', 'have', 'little', 'show', 'way', 'pre-', 'follow', 'starring-in', 'work', 'Be', 'may', 'cast', 'clicked', 'work', 'individual', 'characters', 'interplay', 'one', 'another.My', 'positive', 'review', 'late', 'date', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'particularly', 'worthwhile', 'film', 'place', 'movie', 'history', 'yes', ""'m"", 'bad', 'not', 'acting', 'sooner', 'BUT', ""'re"", 'not', 'homophobe', 'look', 'up', 'are', 'considering', 'film', 'rental', 'new/used', 'purchase', ""'d"", 'say', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'giving', 'try', ""'d"", 'predict', 'not', 'long', 'availability', 'life', 'DVD', 'future', '.PS', 'two', 'other', 'Customer', 'Reviewers', 'have', 'mentioned', 'DVD', 'Special', 'Features', 'Director/Writers', 'Commentary', 'revealing', 'witty', 'will', 'learn', 'example', 'how', 'puzzling', 'was', 'set', 'up', 'male/male', 'anal', 'sex', 'lovemaking', 'scene', 'Apparently', 'one', 'set', 'seemed', 'know', 'yeah', 'sure', 'suitable', 'alignment', 'top', 'bottom', 'actors', 'resulting', 'face-to-face', 'missionary', 'fully', 'extended', 'position', 'was', 'shot', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'ascetically', 'Ratings', 'acceptable', '.come', 'guys', '.having', 'bottom', 'legs', 'least', 'bent', 'knees', 'even', 'better', 'locked', 'ankles', 'top', 'backside', 'would', 'have', 'least', 'lent', 'realism', 'Still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'shot', 'outcome', ""n't"", 'romantic', '****']",N/A

579694,A342EHO42V2G38,B00005B1WL,"Terran ""Terran""","[17, 22]","Ultimately a disappointing film, though the plot is more feasible than the better written and acted RITES OF PASSAGE.  The plot allows five childhood friends now in their late twenties to revisit the past.  The two lone male characters have a PAST that causes one of the men to nurture a grudge and the other to suffer pangs of guilt that the female friends have only a cursory knowledge of.  This serves as one of those tension points in the film, finally explosive as the characters - and the plot - turn on a game of &quot;spin the bottle.&quot;  Besides guilt, the same newly engaged man also is forced to realize he's gone through life as a leaf in the breeze, never setting a deliberate course for himself, but instead unpleasantly residing in a state of complacency.  He doesn't seem to know how to get himself out of this malaise, and this is the root of all his - and the other man's - problems and why things went so horribly bad between them the issue must still be settled more than a decade later.  Though I didn't find any of the characters likeable, seeming far too self-absorbed and infantile, the lot of them, what does work finally are the surprise elements: characters you disliked on sight turn out - by film's end - to be the characters whose view you can most endorse and vice versa.  I've never found real-life relationships to work that way, but in a film setting it functions.",2,Sympathy lost,998179200,"08 19, 2001",2001,1401,"['Ultimately', 'disappointing', 'film', 'plot', 'more', 'feasible', 'better', 'written', 'acted', 'RITES', 'OF', 'PASSAGE', 'plot', 'five', 'childhood', 'friends', 'now', 'late', 'twenties', 'revisit', 'past', 'two', 'lone', 'male', 'characters', 'have', 'PAST', 'one', 'men', 'nurture', 'grudge', 'other', 'suffer', 'pangs', 'guilt', 'female', 'friends', 'have', 'only', 'cursory', 'knowledge', 'one', 'tension', 'points', 'film', 'finally', 'explosive', 'characters', 'plot', 'turn', 'game', 'quot', 'bottle.', 'quot', 'Besides', 'guilt', 'same', 'newly', 'engaged', 'man', 'also', 'forced', 'realize', 'gone', 'through', 'life', 'leaf', 'breeze', 'never', 'setting', 'deliberate', 'course', 'instead', 'unpleasantly', 'residing', 'state', 'complacency', ""n't"", 'seem', 'know', 'how', 'get', 'malaise', 'root', 'other', 'man', 'problems', 'why', 'things', 'went', 'so', 'horribly', 'bad', 'issue', 'must', 'still', 'be', 'settled', 'more', 'decade', 'later', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'characters', 'likeable', 'seeming', 'far', 'too', 'self-absorbed', 'infantile', 'lot', 'what', 'work', 'finally', 'are', 'surprise', 'elements', 'characters', 'disliked', 'sight', 'turn', 'out', 'film', 'end', 'be', 'characters', 'view', 'can', 'most', 'endorse', 'vice', 'versa', ""'ve"", 'never', 'found', 'real-life', 'relationships', 'work', 'way', 'film', 'setting', 'functions']",N/A
