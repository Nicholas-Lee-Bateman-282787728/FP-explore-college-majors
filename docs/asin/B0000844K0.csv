733536,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B0000844K0,"Cloud ""...""","[2, 7]","When I first seriously started getting into anime and not those starter shows people suggest like Evangelion or Dragon Ball Z, I started to get into more obscure ones or just popular ones among anime fans and not the general public. Look at how Yu-Gi-Oh, Pokemon or Airbender are known even to people who don't even bother with anime. One of the initial series was Rurouni Kenshin except I probably watched the amazing Truth/Betrayal OVA's first (which I absolutely reccommend). Reflection, on the other hand, just seems so wrong on so many counts that it's hard to figure out if it was just simply bad ideas or just a genuine lack of care.Essentially, this is the story of Kenshin's later life, burdened by the amount of people he's killed but also the lives that had to live on without their loved ones/friends. Showing re-animated clips of stuff we've already seen in a kind of flashback fashion, we see Kenshin unable to deal with his life, even though he has Kaoru. But Kenshin's fighting isn't over as Enishi, the kid seen in the Trust/Betrayal OVA's is older and he wants revenge.The main problem with this is that it just doesn't feel like a Kenshin story. In Psychology class, we were told a story of a guy with a brain defect that made him unable to recognize his own mother and father, believing them to be imposters. Essentially, I wouldn't go as far with Reflection but not only the spirit is lost, character designs are a bit different but the whole thing just feels off, especially since characters don't act like their series counterparts. This would all be fine if the story was at least decently told. Nope, it mixes so much scenes from the series that it's hard to tell if you're watching a flashback from the series, something they made up or something new. In fact, there were times where I would've been lost had it not been for certain story elements.Is the story about Enishi's revenge or Kenshin's later life? In a way, it's basically him unable to deal with things right in front of him. Even when he says he's happy with Kaoru and their new son, Kenji, he just buggers off and disappears. What happened to fun loving ""oro?"" speaking Kenshin? Not to mention there's Enishi. He was a whiny brat when we first saw him and even though he talks more intelligently he's still a brat. You felt like you wanted to slap him and say smarten up. Trust/Betrayal was nicely animated with lots of memorable images (Tomoe hugging Kenshin from behind is my all-time favorite) but while the character designs are immensely off but backgrounds are pretty well done, especially cherry blossom trees and Kenshin's fight with Enishi is great too.Should you bother with this? Don't know. My dad was a big movie collector and he once remarked that even though a certain actor's movie sucked, he had to have it to complete his ""whoever"" collection. Same thing here. You might hate it, might love it but whether you want to have it for your collection is entirely up to you.",2,2.5; this is not what I fell in love with,1169424000,"01 22, 2007",2007,2976,"['When', 'first', 'seriously', 'started', 'getting', 'anime', 'not', 'starter', 'shows', 'people', 'suggest', 'Evangelion', 'Dragon', 'Ball', 'Z', 'started', 'get', 'more', 'obscure', 'ones', 'just', 'popular', 'ones', 'anime', 'fans', 'not', 'general', 'public', 'Look', 'how', 'Yu-Gi-Oh', 'Pokemon', 'Airbender', 'are', 'known', 'even', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'anime', 'One', 'initial', 'series', 'was', 'Rurouni', 'Kenshin', 'probably', 'watched', 'amazing', 'Truth/Betrayal', 'OVA', 'first', 'absolutely', 'reccommend', 'Reflection', 'other', 'hand', 'just', 'so', 'wrong', 'so', 'many', 'counts', 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'was', 'just', 'simply', 'bad', 'ideas', 'just', 'genuine', 'lack', 'care.Essentially', 'story', 'Kenshin', 'later', 'life', 'burdened', 'amount', 'people', 'killed', 'also', 'lives', 'had', 'live', 'loved', 'ones/friends', 'Showing', 're-animated', 'clips', 'stuff', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'kind', 'flashback', 'fashion', 'see', 'Kenshin', 'unable', 'deal', 'life', 'even', 'Kaoru', 'Kenshin', 'fighting', ""n't"", 'over', 'Enishi', 'kid', 'seen', 'Trust/Betrayal', 'OVA', 'older', 'revenge.The', 'main', 'problem', 'just', ""n't"", 'feel', 'Kenshin', 'story', 'Psychology', 'class', 'were', 'told', 'story', 'guy', 'brain', 'defect', 'made', 'unable', 'recognize', 'own', 'mother', 'father', 'believing', 'be', 'imposters', 'Essentially', 'would', ""n't"", 'go', 'far', 'Reflection', 'not', 'only', 'spirit', 'lost', 'character', 'designs', 'are', 'bit', 'different', 'whole', 'thing', 'just', 'feels', 'off', 'especially', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'act', 'series', 'counterparts', 'would', 'be', 'fine', 'story', 'was', 'least', 'decently', 'told', 'Nope', 'mixes', 'so', 'much', 'scenes', 'series', 'hard', 'tell', ""'re"", 'watching', 'flashback', 'series', 'something', 'made', 'up', 'something', 'new', 'fact', 'were', 'times', 'where', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'lost', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'certain', 'story', 'story', 'Enishi', 'revenge', 'Kenshin', 'later', 'life', 'way', 'basically', 'unable', 'deal', 'things', 'right', 'front', 'Even', 'when', 'happy', 'Kaoru', 'new', 'son', 'Kenji', 'just', 'buggers', 'off', 'disappears', 'What', 'happened', 'fun', 'loving', 'oro', 'speaking', 'Kenshin', 'Not', 'mention', 'Enishi', 'was', 'whiny', 'brat', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'even', 'more', 'intelligently', 'still', 'brat', 'felt', 'wanted', 'slap', 'say', 'smarten', 'up', 'Trust/Betrayal', 'was', 'nicely', 'animated', 'lots', 'memorable', 'images', 'Tomoe', 'hugging', 'Kenshin', 'behind', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'character', 'designs', 'are', 'immensely', 'backgrounds', 'are', 'pretty', 'well', 'done', 'especially', 'cherry', 'blossom', 'trees', 'Kenshin', 'fight', 'Enishi', 'great', 'bother', 'Do', ""n't"", 'know', 'dad', 'was', 'big', 'movie', 'collector', 'once', 'remarked', 'even', 'certain', 'actor', 'movie', 'sucked', 'had', 'have', 'complete', 'whoever', 'collection', 'Same', 'thing', 'here', 'might', 'hate', 'might', 'love', 'want', 'have', 'collection', 'entirely']",N/A

Not some horrible filler episodes, but an OVA based off of the last manga arc of the Rurouni Kenshin series.

His ship gets caught in a storm and in his efforts to save a man from being thrown overboard, he himself is thrown overboard.Kaoru is sick, and after coming back from the port to look for Kenshin, collapses in the dojo.  What happens next is a large flashback to all the important events that had to do with Kenshin and Kaoru's relationship, the biggest ones being Jin-eh kidnapping her (See the second Rurouni Kenshin DVD, Battle in the Moonlight) and of course, the most exciting of all, Kenshin vs Enishi Yukishirou (This is taken from the Jinchuu arc, the final part of the kenshin manga that was not animated).

When it comes to Anime, I pretty much look at everything from an objective point of view, without ties into what I wanted it to be... but with Kenshin it's a little different.Anime Style: well obviously by the title and the cover art it's in the style same as Trust and Betrayal.Gore level: well it is Kenshin... the gore level is lower than Trust and Betrayal, as there is far less killing and more focus on the story, not that the killing in Kenshin was ever gratuitousSuitablity for Children: well some of the concepts probably won't interest children at all, like most anime.  It does have some scenes that are &quot;adult&quot; in that it would children probably won't understand what's going on and something that parents won't want to explain.Alright, with that said and done you have to first recognize that this is a continuation from the other OVA, Trust and Betrayal.  It's 15 years later, Kenshin has gone to China to help with the wars and hasn't come back yet.  He married Kaoru and has a son Kenji (i believe) who has never really seen his father, Kenshin, and therefore doesn't necessarily have the same respect for him as everyone else does.So this entire movie is basically spent &quot;reflecting&quot; upon the past.  Kaoru reflects back on events involving Kenshin, reasons why she loves him and reasons why he would love her.  There is a new scene she reflects upon that we haven't seen yet.  Remeber Tomoe's brother?  Well he's seeking revenge and captures Kaoru in the process.The heavy nature of this anime makes it very dramatical, in the idea that most of it involves the relationship between Kenshin and Kaoru.  Many surprises come up and Kaoru learns more about Kenshin than she previously knew.Some of the scenes you'll notice are taken from parts of the TV series... but not entirely.  Some are written a little differently... but nothing too drastic.  Battle in the Moonlight's Kurogasa scene is written a little differently, removing Kurogasa's supposed powers.  Hints at several other battles, such as Shishio and Sojiro.  You get to see the TV series characters in the different anime style, such as Yahiko and Sanosuke.  It is really worth the watch, and yes it does end the Kenshin series.  It's the final atonement, as the backside would show.  If you get it for any other reason, get it for its finality in the Kenshin Series.  Yes we all hate it when our favorite series come to an end, but it's gotta happen... and this way it a good one.Now if you were a Kenshin fan due to the intense action (like a DBZ fan is) or becuase of the comedy then this might not fit your tastes.  It is crafted after Trust and Betrayal, and if you've seen those and liked them, then this is up your alley.  If you didn't like Trust and Betrayal then you might want to be hesitant about this one first.  Maybe give it a rent or see if you can find some trailers on it, check to see if it really for you.

But the style employed in the OAV series is better suited for tragedy than triumph, and so we are given an ending where all of Kenshin's struggles and achievements result in disease, dysfunction, and death.  Yuck.The problems with ""Seisouhen"" lie squarely with the OAV style, which is emotionally muted, arty, and poorly-suited for action sequences.  While this style worked for the Tsuiokuhen episodes (collected in this country as ""Trust"" and ""Betrayal"") which told the most tragic chapter in Himura Kenshin's life, it is a major shortcoming here.  Indeed, the best sequence is a recreation of the climactic Jinchuu battle between Kenshin and Enishi, where director Kazuhiro Furuhashi all but abandons the OAV look for a style much closer to the original TV series (and the manga).Then there's the question of the material itself.  The Kenshin/Enishi fight is fine, as are several other moments (Kaoru's visions of the past as a series of rooms, the brief flashback appearance of Saito), but why squander all these resources on a re-animation of the Jinei fight from the first TV series (which in no way improves on the original)?

It is the deep emotion of the creator that inspires us all--and inspired I am.Kenshin was always shown as the strongest character, and not just physically, but also emotionally.  No matter how much fans desperately wanted to see some more warmth between him and Kaoru, there never was anything to really satisfy what we were looking for.  As years have passed along, however, and we learn that Kenshin, no matter how you look at him, is only human, we can see a little of his vulnerable side for the first time.  For a character such as his, one that is so fascinating for so many people, it could go either way.  You could, like I did, enjoy watching Kenshin come to terms with the strange and brutal truth of his life, or you could be angry that he did not go out in a blaze of glory.The animation itself is gorgeous.  There was so much thought and detail added to the characters, they could almost jump out of the television and touch you.  In my eyes, everything was perfect, the atmosphere, the music, the dialogue.  Everything was as it should be, and though I admit to crying...yes, crying, I was also a bit happy to see a story that I have loved for so long finally come to a close.

But even though I knew it...even though I knew it, I wanted to chase him, to somehow keep him."" Himura KaoruEvery journey has an ending, and with Rurouni Kenshin: Reflection brings to an conclusion Himura Kenshin's journey of atonement that he has been searching for since his final days as Battousai The Manslayer. Reflection strives to add on to the endings of the anime series Rurouni Kenshin and the manga series as well as giving fans of both a visually emotional yet satisfying ending to Kenshin's endless struggle for atonement for all the lives he has taken, which depends on whether you are a fan of Rurouni Kenshin, or have seen or read the anime and manga series.For those of you who have read the manga know that at the end of the manga series Kenshin and Kauru are married and have a son named Himura Kenji, while Kenshin has given his sword to Yahiko, and Sanosuke has set out on his own journey throughout the world. Reflection picks up over a decade after the end of Rurouni Kenshin the anime series and manga. Kenshin has gone to the continent to help the fledgling Meiji government in the first First Sino-Japanese War, but after the war has ended Kenshin has not returned and is considered missing, yet Kauru who has aged over the years still goes to port every day in hopes of seeing her love. Kauru struggles alone in her and Kenshin's home as their son Kenji who is now a teenager, and who after rejecting his father ran off to train with Kenshin's former master Hiko Seij&#363;r&#333;.The film follows Kenshin's struggle to get home to Kauru, and Kauru's faith and love of Kenshin. Through flashbacks viewers get are able to see how Kenshin and Kauru got to their points in the film. Viewers are also able to finally see the final arch of the Rurouni Kenshin manga brought to life as Enishi Yukishiro returns to seek vengeance on Kenshin for his sister Tomoe death. Through flashbacks viewers are able to see Kenshin's continuing struggle to find atonement even though he is no longer a swordsman. Viewers see even though Kenshin is content, and in a way happy with Kauru and his young son Kenji, but still wishes to find a way to help people and prevent the loss of life, but his struggle has also taken a toll on his body with an unknown disease. The name of the disease Kenshin suffered from is never named in the film. I have heard different theories with the main one being Kenshin suffered from a form of leprosy, which he passed on to Kauru, but I believe it was something else, and Kenshin's body just broke down from Kenshin pushing his body beyond its limits for so long. Kauru is the real star of Reflection has the film shows how strong a woman is, and how much respect people have for her, and her love and support for Kenshin, and the ending is just truly heart wrenching moment.The story is beautifully written and emotionally moving, creating one of the saddest yet emotionally satisfying anime OVA's ever. Yet I can see flaws some will have with Reflection. I have heard some say they do not want to see a broken down Kenshin or how he dies, but in my opinion what we are given in Reflection is a fitting ending to Kenshin's journey and struggle to find atonement, peace and happiness. I mean really come on with the way Kenshin used his body how long did you thing his body could hold up. Just look at athletes from boxing, UFC, football, baseball and other sports. There is only so long a person can push their body to its limits a beyond before it starts to break down, and yet even with his body no longer able to perform in battle I can see Kenshin continuing his selfless battle to help people live and survive. Another flaw I have read people complain about is Kauru. She is a strong willed woman who matches well with Kenshin and is not afraid to enter into battle, and people have complained that she would have gone with Kenshin on his journey, and brought him back. It is a flawed criticism. Critics forget that Kauru was a mother as well, and could not just drag her son on her journey with Kenshin or just abandon him. Then as years went by Kauru's health was failing as well, and she could just not just go off blindly searching for Kenshin. That is just ridiculous, instead I can see her instead supporting the main she loves, raising and loving their son, and being the beacon of light in the darkness so Kenshin would always return home to her, and she proves that by the quote above that Kauru delivers in the OVA.Perhaps the biggest flaw of Reflection is its accessibility. Unlike the OVA Trust and Betrayal, the Rurouni Kenshin anime and manga Reflection takes place in the future, and if you have not seen or read the earlier works you will understand the storylines or connect to the characters as those who are fans of the anime and manga making Reflection simply a love letter meant for fans of the character, and no one else. The story is aided by gorgeous animation done by Studio Deen that rivals any animation that is around today as well as a score by Taku Iwasaki who brought a triumphant yet solemn and uplifting score to Reflection that added emotional impact to each scene.Reflection is certainly not for everyone. The film is certainly not for viewers who are not fans of the characters, and who have not seen or read the anime and manga, but for fans who loved the characters along with the anime and manga series we get a fitting conclusion to Kenshin's journey as well as the love story of Kauru and Kenshin along with getting a glimpse into the lives of our favorite characters and what their future looks like. Reflection delivers on all of those giving viewers a moving conclusion to the journey of Kenshin one of the best characters ever created along with beautiful animation, and a moving score. I highly recommend Reflection for those who are fans of the character, but if you are not or do not know about Himura Kenshin then skip Reflection for now, and instead I highly recommend you watch Trust and Betrayal, watch Rurouni Kenshin the anime series or read the Rurouni Kenshin manga series. You will not be disappointed, and will be introduced to an amazing character as well as being captivated by his struggle and emotional journey.",5,"The fittingly moving and emotionally satisfying

Fortunately, what we have for the conclusion of the &quot;Rurni Kenshin&quot; saga is a hybrid between the two that, for the most part, works to provides an interesting ending for fans, especially in light of how the original series concluded.  NOTE: Be sure to watch the end credits after episode 2 for an epilogue.Many years have passed since the battles of the Meiji Restoration during which Kenshin made his name as the Hitokiri Battousai.  Now, in the year 1893, Kenshin's second wife, the loving and devoted Kaoru, is pining away waiting looking out over the harbor for the return of her husband from the continent where he has gone to continue his quest to atone for his many sins of murder, including that of his first wife, Tomoe.  For all this time he has used his reverse blade sword only to protect those who need his protection, yet the peace and redemption Kenshin seeks have been denied him.  Kaoru mourns not only the absence of her husband, but that of their son, Kenji, as well.  Meanwhile, Kenshin has been washed overboard during a storm as he crosses the sea back to Japan, and wonders if this is how his life is fated to end.The animation continues to reflect the higher standards of the &quot;Samurai X&quot; efforts and we are presented with more mature versions of the characters from the anime series.  The fact that the characters are fifteen years older and drawn in a more &quot;adult&quot; style, for lack of a better term, are appropriate but somewhat problematic because sometimes you cannot tell who the characters are, especially with the time jumps in the narrative.  Plus there is the larger concern in that I think most fans of the series are not going to want to believe that the story is heading in the direction it ends up going (and one that was apparently not endorsed by the manga's creator Nobuhiro Watsuki) as we end on a much sadder note than you would have expected.On the one hand the finale is poignant, even more so with the epilogue, but on the other the point director Kazuhiro Furuhashi is making can be seen as running counter to the overall spirit of &quot;Rurni Kenshin.&quot;  There is no middle ground here because &quot;Reflection&quot; cannot stand on its own and devoted fans of the anime will either cherish it or despise it.",4,The somber end of the anima saga of Rurni Kenshin,1086566400,"06 7, 2004",2004,2685,"['watching', 'quot', 'Samurai', 'X', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'quot', 'quot', 'Rurni', 'Kenshin', 'Ishin', 'shishi', 'Requiem', 'quot', 'where', 'suddenly', 'Samurai', 'X', 'figure', 'prequel', 'quot', 'Betrayal', 'quot', 'quot', 'Trust', 'quot', 'was', 'back', 'present', 'so', 'speak', 'Kenshin', 'Himura', 'anime', 'series', 'was', 'wary', 'what', 'would', 'find', 'quot', 'Samurai', 'X', 'Reflection', 'quot', 'quot', 'Rurni', 'Kenshin', 'Seis', 'hen', 'quot', 'Fortunately', 'what', 'have', 'conclusion', 'quot', 'Rurni', 'Kenshin', 'quot', 'saga', 'hybrid', 'two', 'most', 'part', 'interesting', 'ending', 'fans', 'especially', 'light', 'how', 'original', 'series', 'concluded', 'NOTE', 'Be', 'sure', 'watch', 'end', 'credits', 'episode', '2', 'epilogue.Many', 'years', 'have', 'passed', 'battles', 'Meiji', 'Restoration', 'Kenshin', 'made', 'name', 'Hitokiri', 'Battousai', 'Now', 'year', '1893', 'Kenshin', 'second', 'wife', 'loving', 'devoted', 'Kaoru', 'pining', 'away', 'waiting', 'looking', 'out', 'harbor', 'return', 'husband', 'continent', 'where', 'gone', 'continue', 'quest', 'atone', 'many', 'sins', 'murder', 'including', 'first', 'wife', 'Tomoe', 'time', 'used', 'reverse', 'blade', 'sword', 'only', 'protect', 'who', 'need', 'protection', 'peace', 'redemption', 'Kenshin', 'have', 'been', 'denied', 'Kaoru', 'not', 'only', 'absence', 'husband', 'son', 'Kenji', 'as', 'well', 'Meanwhile', 'Kenshin', 'been', 'washed', 'overboard', 'storm', 'sea', 'back', 'Japan', 'wonders', 'how', 'life', 'fated', 'end.The', 'animation', 'reflect', 'higher', 'standards', 'quot', 'Samurai', 'X', 'quot', 'efforts', 'are', 'presented', 'more', 'mature', 'versions', 'characters', 'anime', 'series', 'fact', 'characters', 'are', 'fifteen', 'years', 'older', 'drawn', 'more', 'quot', 'adult', 'quot', 'style', 'lack', 'better', 'term', 'are', 'appropriate', 'somewhat', 'problematic', 'sometimes', 'can', 'not', 'tell', 'who', 'characters', 'are', 'especially', 'time', 'narrative', 'larger', 'concern', 'think', 'most', 'fans', 'series', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'want', 'believe', 'story', 'heading', 'direction', 'up', 'going', 'one', 'was', 'apparently', 'not', 'endorsed', 'manga', 'creator', 'Nobuhiro', 'Watsuki', 'end', 'much', 'sadder', 'note', 'would', 'have', 'one', 'hand', 'finale', 'poignant', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'epilogue', 'other', 'point', 'director', 'Kazuhiro', 'Furuhashi', 'making', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'running', 'counter', 'overall', 'spirit', 'quot', 'Rurni', 'Kenshin.', 'quot', 'middle', 'ground', 'here', 'quot', 'Reflection', 'quot', 'can', 'not', 'stand', 'own', 'devoted', 'fans', 'anime', 'will', 'cherish', 'despise']",N/A

While the contain a commonality in characters and are the go further in the direction of presenting more of the motivations that lie behind master assassin Kenshin Himura's decisions and provide us with closure on the story of a life full of regret and the quest for atonement.All of the OVA's, 'Reflections' included, lack the comic relief of the TV series.  In that sense they are an acknowledgement of Kenshin's contribution, and the ongoing price he would have to pay for being a murderer.  In 'Reflections,' Kenshin seeks the ability to be at peace again.  And Kaoru, the loyal wife of his later years wants desperately to be as important a part of his life as his first love, Tomoe, who sacrificed her life at his hands so that he could go on to fight the Shogun.The pressures of their lives drive them apart on more time, as Kenshin travels to China to help the living.  But the real story is the retelling of their relationship and it's themes in carefully interwoven flashbacks.  The threads of destiny and duty wind tighter and tighter as the drama, reminiscent of Greek tragedy as well as Noh plays, comes to its bittersweet conclusion.It is almost unfortunate that 'The Cross-shaped Wound' (the last episode of the previous OVA volume) reached such a high standard of artistry.  'Reflections' is wonderful, beautifully written, illustrated and scored, but it lacks the utter magic of its predecessor.  I can't fault it though, it is the difference between excellent and perfection, and I am delighted to have experienced both in the same series.Part of the stories charm is the maturing of not just Kenshin and Kaoru, but many of the supporting cast.  Yahiko Myojin, a loyal friend, is a story unto himself, and several villains also make surprising developments.  All of this gives the story a compelling multi-dimensionality that is infinitely satifying.Because Rurouni Kenshin is a historical romance surrounding real events, as well as a story with deep samurai roots, it appeals to a broad audience.  In a sense, it stands at the apex of the use of anime as classical Japanese drama.  Thus, it is worth seeking out for many reasons, illuminating and uplifting as well as entertaining.  Above all, it will become an unforgettable memory.",5,"""The last of life, for which the first was made""",1052956800,"05 15, 2003",2003,2417,"[""'Samurai"", 'X', 'OVA', 'stand', 'separate', 'body', 'Rurouni', 'Kenshin', 'series', 'subject', 'events', 'preceding', 'following', 'television', 'stories', 'contain', 'commonality', 'characters', 'are', 'go', 'further', 'direction', 'presenting', 'more', 'motivations', 'lie', 'master', 'assassin', 'Kenshin', 'Himura', 'decisions', 'provide', 'closure', 'story', 'life', 'full', 'regret', 'quest', 'atonement.All', 'OVA', ""'Reflections"", 'included', 'lack', 'comic', 'relief', 'TV', 'series', 'sense', 'are', 'acknowledgement', 'Kenshin', 'contribution', 'ongoing', 'price', 'would', 'have', 'pay', 'being', 'murderer', ""'Reflections"", 'Kenshin', 'ability', 'be', 'peace', 'again', 'Kaoru', 'loyal', 'wife', 'later', 'years', 'desperately', 'be', 'important', 'part', 'life', 'first', 'love', 'Tomoe', 'who', 'sacrificed', 'life', 'hands', 'so', 'could', 'go', 'fight', 'Shogun.The', 'pressures', 'lives', 'drive', 'apart', 'more', 'time', 'Kenshin', 'China', 'help', 'living', 'real', 'story', 'retelling', 'relationship', 'themes', 'carefully', 'interwoven', 'flashbacks', 'threads', 'destiny', 'duty', 'wind', 'tighter', 'tighter', 'drama', 'reminiscent', 'Greek', 'tragedy', 'as', 'well', 'Noh', 'bittersweet', 'conclusion.It', 'almost', 'unfortunate', 'Cross-shaped', 'Wound', 'last', 'episode', 'previous', 'OVA', 'volume', 'reached', 'high', 'standard', 'artistry', ""'Reflections"", 'wonderful', 'beautifully', 'written', 'illustrated', 'scored', 'utter', 'magic', 'predecessor', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fault', 'difference', 'excellent', 'perfection', 'am', 'delighted', 'have', 'experienced', 'same', 'series.Part', 'stories', 'charm', 'maturing', 'not', 'just', 'Kenshin', 'Kaoru', 'many', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Yahiko', 'Myojin', 'loyal', 'friend', 'story', 'unto', 'several', 'villains', 'also', 'make', 'surprising', 'developments', 'story', 'compelling', 'multi-dimensionality', 'infinitely', 'satifying.Because', 'Rurouni', 'Kenshin', 'historical', 'romance', 'surrounding', 'real', 'events', 'as', 'well', 'story', 'deep', 'samurai', 'roots', 'appeals', 'broad', 'audience', 'sense', 'apex', 'use', 'anime', 'classical', 'Japanese', 'drama', 'Thus', 'worth', 'seeking', 'out', 'many', 'reasons', 'illuminating', 'uplifting', 'as', 'well', 'entertaining', 'will', 'become', 'unforgettable', 'memory']",N/A

733558,A3DBHO9ZN7GXZI,B0000844K0,m-chan,"[11, 11]","The one-star rating refers specifically to Reflection: Director's Cut. I would rate the original Reflection release--a two-part OAV--four stars. It had its content problems, as most Kenshin fans know. But I loved the quality of animation and the strength of the music, and I went with the content. I didn't feel ripped off, as it all seemed a worthy effort (even if doing a feature of Jinchu Arc would've been energy much better spent.)The director's cut, however, makes me feel VERY ripped off. Why? It may provide about 14 minutes of extra footage, and further interviews with the Japanese voice actors; and for those who like the American track, there is a commentary track by the American voice actors. It also gets rid of the melodramatic dialog over the end credits. HOWEVER, it does an absolutely abysmal overhaul of the soundtrack once you get into the ""part 2"" material, ejecting some of the BEST and most exciting scoring for a rehash of music from Trust and Betrayal. The fight with Enishi is one such instance. In the original Reflection, this fight was electrifying, loaded with tension, the scoring absolutely wonderful. Well, that scoring's gone here. Why? Who knows. And the fight scene suffers terribly from this change. Other tampering with the music includes ""blanket tossing"" the opening theme around, and really ruining Yahiko's fight with Kenji. Such musical revisions all seem so careless, deflating what was previously exciting or touching or thought-provoking. They lack accent for emotion, and when spanning scene shifts, they ignore dramatic enhancement ... a terrible thing to do an anime that was originally, with respect to its scoring, nearly flawless. It also cheapens the Trust and Betrayal music, which I happen to love when it's used well.The most I'll do with this DVD is pop it in for the extra 14 minutes when watching my original Reflection ... if I even do that. To be frank, I wish I had waited and gotten this thing used on the super cheap. The 14 minutes are worth something, I suppose, particularly as Saito shows up in one of those minutes; but nothing here is worth the full price of the disk. In fact, the sense I got from this was that nobody really cared what in heck they were doing, and that grates.For those who are interested in either Reflection release but have not seen other Kenshin material (Trust and Betrayal; the Rurouni Kenshin series), the story here may confuse you and will probably not have much of an emotional impact.

Apparently the producers felt they didn't need to animate the Jinchuu arc, why instead condense it to 10 minutes (maybe) and butcher the hell out of it.  All the readers who either can read japanese (which i am sadly not one of them, getting there though) or found dedicated fans who translated them and scanned them all, will see how wrong and incorrect the entire 'mini jinchuu' is.  And the thing about Kenshin ignoring his family to help people? (I can see how people would get that the written jinchuu arc (which should be animated), but in the animated series it never happened! So why ruin Kenshin?!) Kenshin would NEVER neglate Kaoru and Kenji, what universe is this from? I just can't say enough of how bad it truly is.And the end? I mean come on, (alright i will give in to the disease, as it was hinted at throughout the series) but how could you end the famous Kenshin series, how could you honestly believe in such a sad, ending to such a great character? That is what put tears in my eyes, what they let happen to him, not the actually plot, fake 'reality' they tried to pull.  In conclusion, i totally deny the existence of such horrible ending (Sano and Megumi didn't end together? What's w/ that?!).I think the collective group of Kenshin fans should protest and get those lazy producers off (...) and animated the Jinchuu, a trully fitting end to the great Kenshin series.

733560,A2GI78DN6CXAP7,B0000844K0,N. Nozari,"[2, 4]","I see that the reviews on this DVD are divided into two groups: ones who love it, ones who hate it. So, maybe my review would be helpful to the new reader. Kenshin series has two faces to it. The first one, which is mostly reflected in the TV series is the legend of a Samurai, with utmost skill and best of intentions. The atmosphere is gay and uplifting and it's a great series for both kids and adults. The second face -or the deeper layer of the story- is the legend of the struggle of a man's soul in the journey of life, the story of repent, immense sorrow and indefinite pain. This side of the story is transparent in the TV series and only reveals itself in the trilogy of Trust, Betrayal and Samurai X Reflection. Unlike the TV series, and in harmony with the content, these DVDs are extremely dark and gloomy, definitely not suitable for children.So, it's perfectly fine to just go after the TV series and never get to these three. However, if you can handle a bitter story but are looking for true depth then proceed.I also saw comments on an over-romantic organization of Samurai X reflection. I don't say it's not true. However, I recommend taking it a little more symbolically than by its face value. It's the story of Kenshin's soul striving to overcome the pain, and the devotion of people who care about him. It's difficult to portray that, so the creator uses personification of love, compassion and pain in a mundane form, which, I believe, could look a little too base to some people.

733562,A37G6UPLDGH81P,B0000844K0,"Ookami ""daronin""","[4, 9]","I was one of those fortunate people that imported this DVD.  Being a fan of the first rouruni kenshin OVA, and the animated series, I was looking forward too seeing the conclusion.  It was absoloutly beautiful.  Sweet, sad, dramatic, heartfelt storytelling that never ever slipped into cheesiness like some unmentionable films (Titanic.  Gladiator.)  With wonderfully animated and intense action scenes.  It Was a love letter too all the fans of the kenshin series.  A way too say goodbye too kenshin, Kaoru, Sanosuke, Yahiko, Megumi, Tsubami, Hiko Seijuro, and a few others.  The Fates of all of these are revealed in this film.  There are some very sly jokes, like Hiko's continuous love of alcohol and stern refusal not too age.  It drew a tear as the credits roled, for it was just so heartfelt, beautiful, and touching.Yet I still have nightmares about what ADV did too the last OVA, having seen a imported subtitled version of The first Kenshin OVA; I was appaled at what ADV divided into two disks and called; ""trust"" and ""Betrayal"".  Tomoe was rewritten into a Vamp, enishi into an arrogant young man, and Seito was okinas master, plot inconsistancies were abundant.  Changes too the plot were everywhere, and nothing was changed for the better.  As any fan that understands japanese, or saw the imported subtitle, ""Trust"" and ""betrayal""  will tell you, The ADV version was watered down in complexity and depth.  I shudder too think that ADV will repeat such a tradgedy with this release.  They have already changed the title from Seisouhen (year of frost) too Reflection.  So perhaps my misgivings are correct.Nonetheless, I am quite happy with my import.  those unwilling or unable to do so, feel free too pick up this domestic release.  Its better then nothing.  And I am hoping that ADV for once only changed the title of the DVD and nothing else.

733563,AO3P5BXFCXFHD,B0000844K0,Pandra Selivanov,"[4, 5]","Warning-Major SpoilersFirst of all, it's important to know that Nobuhiro Watsuki, the creator of the manga Rurouni Kenshin, did not like this movie. He did not approve the ending and has gone on record as saying that he wanted Kenshin to have a happy ending. Both the anime and the manga had the happy ending Watsuki wanted for Kenshin, and that is more fitting, in a literary sense, than this movie which is a betrayal of everything that made both the manga and the anime special.It's not that a sad ending is necessarily bad. It's that Watsuki wanted to create a character with a dark past that redeemed himself and found happiness. In a sense, Kenshin makes a full circle in the manga and the anime. He begins life as the child Shinta, who seems to have been happy enough in his home with his family. Then his parents die from cholera, which must have been traumatic enough without being sold into slavery. The slavers are killed by bandits, along with their merchandise, but Shinta is saved by Hiko Seijuro, who renames him Kenshin and takes him for an apprentice to the Hiten Mitsurugi style. At the age of 14, Kenshin runs away to become an assassin during the revolution, then spends 10 years wandering after killing the woman he loved. It's a horrible life, but he did have the few years of happiness in his home with his mother and father. And Watsuki brought him full circle in the end to happiness in his home with Karou and Kenji.Reflection doesn't just have a bad ending for Kenshin. The whole story doesn't make much sense when you look at character development in either the manga or the anime. Kenshin is not the kind of person who can walk out on his responsibilities, even if it may cost him his life. To have him walking out on his own son is to invalidate the character, in the same way that making Sherlock Holmes a womanizer or Mr. Spock a party animal would invalidate those characters. It doesn't even work in an alternate universe, because when strong characters are developed over years, the rules of the story that developed them apply more and more as the years go on. Kenshin simply would not walk out on his son.Which brings us to Karou, another invalid character in Reflection. She couldn't even let him go to Kyoto to face Shishio without following along-the only way she would agree to Kenshin leaving her and Kenji would be if she had completely lost her mind and forgotten everything about her life. Karou was a strong, independent woman who understood Kenshin and his needs, but she never would have tolerated him leaving his family. If he even tried to leave, she would have packed up Kenji, grabbed Sanosuke and Yahiko, and gone after him until he returned home, where Megumi would examine his head. Anybody who has gone through the anime and/or the manga knows this.The disease that Kenshin dies from is not specified, yet it's not hard to understand that if he had a communicable disease, he would not be trying to ""share his pain"" with Karou. He seems to transmit it to her by sexual intercourse, so the movie certainly seems to be implying it's a disease he picked up by the same method. Kenshin was presented as being a continent person during all his wanderings-the only woman he seemed to be with before was his wife, Tomoe, and the idea that he would suddenly not be able to control himself is in itself rather insulting to the character. Kenshin leaving Karou to sleep around Japan is just another layer of impossibility on the character created for this movie. Karou deciding that she would like to catch an incurable STD is beyond ridiculous.Perhaps the most bizarre character in this movie is Sanosuke. He's living in China and finds Kenshin. He remembers how Kenshin was when they first met, and mourns the loss of his friend when he realizes Kenshin doesn't even recognize him. His solution is to go out and kill a tiger for its liver. He then puts Kenshin on a boat to Japan and doesn't give him another thought. After the battle with Shishio, Sanosuke had a broken hand and cracked ribs and carried Kenshin all the way back to the inn where the others were waiting. Here he just dumps his dying best friend on a boat and figures that somehow he'll make it back home. Sanosuke's desertion of Kenshin at the time he needed him the most is the saddest and most troubling betrayal of the whole movie.I don't know what happened with this movie. I don't know how the powers that be decided to take everything that made Kenshin Himura a wonderful memorable character out, and put together a character that doesn't resemble the real rurouni any more than I do. I don't know why the wonderful voice actors and animators and composers, some of whom had worked on the real anime, agreed to be part of this. All I do know is that this movie might work as a stand-alone if you've never heard of the real Kenshin and you like to watch something dark and depressing. If you're a true fan, you cannot like this movie, because it's not the real Kenshin. It's something that bears his name, but was rightly rejected by his creator and most of his fans, and is best thought of as some dark nightmare that occurred in an alternate universe.",1,"If you love

Brown,"[0, 2]","While not to recap what all has been said, Seisohen or as ADV retitled it, Reflection, is the latest of the Kenshin animation, but by no means can you count it the last. The nature of the anime industry is to keep everything viable, even if viewers might think otherwise.That said, I imported this last year and just yesterday finished watching the ADV version. (subtitled)  I couldn't truly recall any major differences in how the two flowed against each other, so while I'm a novice in Japanese, I did feel the translation worked.  The animation itself, of course, was a little bit cleaner, being the offical domestic release and all.One thing not mentioned or I didn't catch, was that the character design is somewhat different than in the last Kenshin OVA.  With the introduction of characters of the series, it seems that there was a pull back on the design from more realistic to less. The result is mostly larger eyes and color schemes which refer to the manga and to the tv series.  While, nice, I felt the realism of the first OVA made it even more striking.  Kenshin has fully orange/red hair in this one and even purple eyes to boot, while his son Kenji, ironically, reminds us more of the character design of the first OVA.So in essence, Seisohen is less of a venture away from the tv series in character design, than was the OVA that preceded it.  The storyline does recap events from the tv series, but its well worth it simply for the slightly different re-interpetations and just to revisit those moments with the much higher quality animation. (The recaps are not related at all to series footage, everything has been re-animated in a different manner).  You also get a glimpse of the Jinchu (Revenge) Arc of the manga, which never made it to the tv series.And yes, this OVA flies left on a tangent from the manga and the tv series, but then again, the tv series did the same with the manga.  The underlying themes of all the above, however, remain true and which is why Seisohen is still a great piece of Kenshin animation.  The music is also along similar themes, but fails to really capture the moment as it did in the prior OVA. By no means is it a lackdown, just not on the exact same level.I truly hope that with Kenshin now playing on the Cartoon network, even with its english dub, that the series' popularity will climb higher.  Even to the extent that ADV might use its growing clout to attempt to at least offer money for further Kenshin animation. (Long as there's no drop in quality!)On a pure technical annoying note, the English dubbing of this OVA is done in 5.1 Dolby, while the Japanese is merely 2.0.

I am actually trying to get the whole series on DVD includin da Jinchuu arc which is only on the Manga on Shonen Jump. This Movie Reflection is a bit confusing at first but then gets even more confusing as the story goes on. WHY? Because the story takes place about 10 years after the fight with Shishio. The whole feeling has also changed where everyone of the series has changed even Kenshin. Kenshin has becomed very weak and confused when he was forced to fight the war in Shanghai, China and has come back to Japan pretty much helpless. Kaoru is the same way she is pathetic in the final hours of her life, she lost the whole willin to be strong when she gets a desease from Kenshin and even on the verge of dying. Yahiko has become much older and much stronger and is tryin to find Kennji (Kenshin and Kaorus son) Yahiko became the exact opposite attitude of the one in the series. Sanosuke has left Tokyo and is a free spirit is willin to help Kenshin in his tough time, Sanosuke was only in 9% of the movie so it was kind of dissapointing. When Kenshin left everything changes but also is a little stupid if you think about it.

This illness however, is a reflection of two distinct things: in the story presented here, Kenshin is not afflicted with some earthly disease such as leprosy or turberculosis. Megumi tells Kaoru that Kenshin is only a man, and that all of the fighting he has done will eventually take its toll. Kenshin also talks about having given up his sword and suffering in a different way to continue atoning for his past - and that is what I believe causes his illness. The lesions are an outer reflection of his inner turmoil and guilt, feelings that his once strong body can no longer supress. Kaoru doesn't contract it because it's communicable, but rather because her soul is so bound up in Kenshin's that she shares all of his pain, spiritual as well as physical. She willing shares his burden out of her great love for him.The story of Reflection takes a beloved character and reflects a flawed understanding of just who Kenshin was and what his story was about. His essential nature has always been that of a deeply scarred man attempting to atone for his past. He has always suffered and felt guilt for the killing he has done, yet he is also the wanderer who has cared for many people. A man who never abandoned his principles such that his very example has helped other unhappy and guilty souls find peace and purpose (i.e. Megumi, Sano, Saitou, Aoshi, even some of Shishio's Juppengatana). To believe that this man would, after all his been through - even after making his peace with Enishi - STILL be wandering around Japan, abandoning Kaoru and their son, is just unbelievable. The whole point of the story as I understand it is that Kenshin finally finds a home with Karoru at the Kamiya dojo since it was a place where he was accepted for both his past and present selves. He has found peace by defeating (or accepting) his past demons in the form of Shishio, and ultimately Enishi. Not only did Kenshin find rest from his wandering, but also a chance at happiness. The corruption of Kenshin's body is simply a reflection of how corrupt the story of Reflection ultimately is.It's hard as a Kenshin fan to accept that this is the latest, and presumeably last, installment in Kenshin's story. I believe that while there are some minor good things - such as seeing Kenji (his fight with Yahiko was the highpoint of the story) and finally getting to see Enishi's arc (if only briefly) were minor pleasures in what is ultimately a bittersweet ending. I believe that the original name, Year of Frost, was well very chosen. This is the melancholy version of how Kenshin's story might have turned out if things had been different. I personally prefer the story where Kenshin not only finds peace and forgiveness for himself, but happiness too.",3,"Reflecting on ""Reflection""",1050537600,"04 17, 2003",2003,2873,"['One', 'most', 'disturbing', 'images', 'new', 'Kenshin', 'OVA', 'Reflection', 'see', 'Kenshin', 'failing', 'grip', 'sort', 'disease', 'illness', 'however', 'reflection', 'two', 'distinct', 'things', 'story', 'presented', 'here', 'Kenshin', 'not', 'afflicted', 'earthly', 'disease', 'such', 'leprosy', 'turberculosis', 'Megumi', 'Kaoru', 'Kenshin', 'only', 'man', 'fighting', 'done', 'will', 'eventually', 'take', 'toll', 'Kenshin', 'also', 'having', 'given', 'up', 'sword', 'suffering', 'different', 'way', 'continue', 'atoning', 'past', 'what', 'believe', 'illness', 'lesions', 'are', 'outer', 'reflection', 'inner', 'turmoil', 'guilt', 'feelings', 'once', 'strong', 'body', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'supress', 'Kaoru', ""n't"", 'contract', 'communicable', 'rather', 'soul', 'so', 'bound', 'up', 'Kenshin', 'shares', 'pain', 'spiritual', 'as', 'well', 'physical', 'willing', 'shares', 'burden', 'great', 'love', 'him.The', 'story', 'Reflection', 'beloved', 'character', 'flawed', 'understanding', 'just', 'who', 'Kenshin', 'was', 'what', 'story', 'was', 'about', 'essential', 'nature', 'always', 'been', 'deeply', 'scarred', 'man', 'attempting', 'atone', 'past', 'always', 'suffered', 'felt', 'guilt', 'killing', 'done', 'also', 'wanderer', 'who', 'cared', 'many', 'people', 'man', 'who', 'never', 'abandoned', 'principles', 'such', 'very', 'example', 'helped', 'other', 'unhappy', 'guilty', 'souls', 'find', 'peace', 'purpose', 'i.e', 'Megumi', 'Sano', 'Saitou', 'Aoshi', 'even', 'Shishio', 'Juppengatana', 'believe', 'man', 'would', 'been', 'even', 'making', 'peace', 'Enishi', 'STILL', 'be', 'wandering', 'Japan', 'abandoning', 'Kaoru', 'son', 'just', 'unbelievable', 'whole', 'point', 'story', 'understand', 'Kenshin', 'finally', 'home', 'Karoru', 'Kamiya', 'dojo', 'was', 'place', 'where', 'was', 'accepted', 'past', 'present', 'selves', 'found', 'peace', 'defeating', 'accepting', 'past', 'demons', 'form', 'Shishio', 'ultimately', 'Enishi', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'Kenshin', 'find', 'rest', 'wandering', 'also', 'chance', 'happiness', 'corruption', 'Kenshin', 'body', 'simply', 'reflection', 'how', 'corrupt', 'story', 'Reflection', 'ultimately', 'is.It', 'hard', 'Kenshin', 'fan', 'accept', 'latest', 'presumeably', 'last', 'installment', 'Kenshin', 'story', 'believe', 'are', 'minor', 'good', 'things', 'such', 'seeing', 'Kenji', 'fight', 'Yahiko', 'was', 'highpoint', 'story', 'finally', 'getting', 'see', 'Enishi', 'arc', 'only', 'briefly', 'were', 'minor', 'pleasures', 'what', 'ultimately', 'bittersweet', 'ending', 'believe', 'original', 'name', 'Year', 'Frost', 'was', 'well', 'very', 'chosen', 'melancholy', 'version', 'how', 'Kenshin', 'story', 'might', 'have', 'turned', 'out', 'things', 'had', 'been', 'different', 'personally', 'prefer', 'story', 'where', 'Kenshin', 'not', 'only', 'peace', 'forgiveness', 'happiness', 'too']",N/A

It's mostly taken from Karou's point of view, so the storyline seems more skewed, since we don't get to see development from Kenshin's side, like in the TV show. Also, it plays with the storyline, not being QUITE accurate, but not completely deviating... at least, not until the end.Still, you get to see Karou fall in love with Kenshin in a fairly intimate way. Although we get to see that in the TV show, there's something in this OAV that makes you understand why she just stuck with him the whole time.Hmmm... besides you get to see Tomoe's brother, Enishi, Sanosuke, a grown-up Yahiko (he's COOL!!), Kenshin and Karou's son, Kenji, Megumi, and Hiko-sama. For this alone, I think this was worth it... although... um... tough call.

Kenji resents this and even goes  master hiko in an attempt to connect with his father's true strenghth. Karou also waits for kenshin's return and is also very sick, but will kenshins poor health prevent him from comming back to his true love? Will Kenji finally connect with his daddy?

733571,A10U58PHFDK81C,B0000844K0,The Anime  Adict,"[6, 7]","Okay now then let me make clear that the first part of this review is a comparing the Director's cut vr. the normal. Also first off Samurai X Reflections takes place about ten years after the end of the manga and series and sheds light on what happens after words. The story is told threw Karu's eye, though this karu is completely different from the Karu in the series. However she is what you would expect an older Karu from the manga would be like. Also there is little if any gore in this movie.Now then if you are trying to decide which one to buy, I would say buy this one for the simple fact it fills some of the questions the other version does not. For example you learn exactly why Kenshin gave up his sword, it also gives a better answer to what desease he is inflicted with. Also the flow of the story is smoother and things make more sense. The last difference is some minor corrections in grammar though there is  still the misspernounce a certain name. However if you have already baught the original version of the ova, don't bother buying this version. There are only about ten minutes worth of extra footage not to mention the end diologe during the end credits which is a rather let down. Second though slight some areas are missing their music but that's nic picking.Now then on to the actual review. I want to say a few things first before I begin. I first off this is not for children, not that there is anything that any one but the most straight laced old biddy will have a problem with. It has more to do with that children just won't get what's going on as this is not a simple story. Second if you were hoping for a happy ending for our favorite wondering samurai, this ain't it.As I said this story is told threw Karu's eyes and give the story a completely different light. The story is just as tragic and flawless as trust and betral, though the ending is somewhat opened for those the opptimist, make sure to watch threw the credits and have the subs on to get the true ending. Saying the story is wonderful is self appearent since Samurai X IS the best tragedy ever created.The music is again flawless as is the English voice acting that is actually better then the japanese actors, I know end of the world stuff. Everything concerning sound is dead on.Imagery is some of the best I have seen in the two hundred some anime series I've seen. Though the color sceme is brighter then turst and bestrayal they are do not harm the atmosphere but rather add to it. Every one has aged very well especially Kenshin.Though I normally over look atmosphere I believe that it would be a mistake not to at the very least mention it. The atmosphere of reflections is perfect everything contriputs to the feel of sadness and regret.In ending if you want to see how things end buy this dvd. If you just plan enjoy a good tragedy buy this dvd. If you such plan like a good story buy this dvd. I can't recommend it too highly.Now then before I end I want to say a few things and clear up some missunderstandings I've heard from people. First off Kenshin wonders because he has to, he can not find peace and thus is forced to wonder. Think, a mans gotta do what a mans gotta do, he just has to. Second Kenshin doesn't return and is leaving in poverity because he has ammenesia and is a forgiener in China after the Chinese and Japonese war and has a deseases. Third Sonoaska doesn't return with him because he knows that that there is nothing more he can do and the best thing he could do to honor everything Kenshin has meant to him is to live his life done his new path, notice his trade make ""Bad"" sign is gone. Fourth why did Kenji leave home? Think about it his father was the main factor that brought down the last government and changed the course of history and was one of the greatest swordsmen to have ever lived, he just wanted to get to know his father and his strength. That is why Yoheko left Kenshin's sword with him for a night. To a samurai their sword is the physical embodiment of their ideals and soul, in away it is their heart. So in away that night Kenji was having a father son talk remembering Kenshin's last sword fight. that's it I hope it helped",5,Is this better edit then un edit?,1155254400,"08 11, 2006",2006,4185,"['Okay', 'now', 'then', 'let', 'make', 'clear', 'first', 'part', 'review', 'comparing', 'Director', 'cut', 'vr', 'normal', 'Also', 'first', 'off', 'Samurai', 'X', 'Reflections', 'place', 'ten', 'years', 'end', 'manga', 'series', 'sheds', 'light', 'what', 'words', 'story', 'told', 'Karu', 'eye', 'karu', 'completely', 'different', 'Karu', 'series', 'However', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'older', 'Karu', 'manga', 'would', 'be', 'Also', 'little', 'gore', 'movie.Now', 'then', 'are', 'trying', 'decide', 'one', 'buy', 'would', 'say', 'buy', 'one', 'simple', 'fact', 'questions', 'other', 'version', 'not', 'example', 'learn', 'exactly', 'why', 'Kenshin', 'gave', 'up', 'sword', 'also', 'better', 'answer', 'what', 'desease', 'inflicted', 'Also', 'flow', 'story', 'smoother', 'things', 'make', 'more', 'sense', 'last', 'difference', 'minor', 'corrections', 'grammar', 'still', 'misspernounce', 'certain', 'name', 'However', 'have', 'already', 'baught', 'original', 'version', 'ova', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'buying', 'version', 'are', 'only', 'about', 'ten', 'minutes', 'extra', 'footage', 'not', 'mention', 'end', 'diologe', 'end', 'credits', 'rather', 'let', 'down', 'Second', 'slight', 'areas', 'are', 'missing', 'music', 'nic', 'picking.Now', 'then', 'actual', 'review', 'want', 'say', 'few', 'things', 'first', 'begin', 'first', 'not', 'children', 'not', 'anything', 'one', 'most', 'straight', 'laced', 'old', 'biddy', 'will', 'have', 'problem', 'more', 'do', 'children', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'what', 'going', 'not', 'simple', 'story', 'Second', 'were', 'hoping', 'happy', 'ending', 'favorite', 'wondering', 'samurai', 'ai', ""n't"", 'it.As', 'said', 'story', 'told', 'Karu', 'eyes', 'give', 'story', 'completely', 'different', 'light', 'story', 'just', 'tragic', 'flawless', 'trust', 'betral', 'ending', 'somewhat', 'opened', 'opptimist', 'make', 'sure', 'watch', 'credits', 'have', 'subs', 'get', 'true', 'ending', 'Saying', 'story', 'wonderful', 'self', 'appearent', 'Samurai', 'X', 'best', 'tragedy', 'ever', 'created.The', 'music', 'again', 'flawless', 'English', 'voice', 'acting', 'actually', 'better', 'then', 'japanese', 'actors', 'know', 'end', 'world', 'stuff', 'Everything', 'concerning', 'sound', 'dead', 'on.Imagery', 'best', 'have', 'seen', 'two', 'hundred', 'anime', 'series', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'color', 'sceme', 'brighter', 'then', 'turst', 'are', 'do', 'not', 'harm', 'atmosphere', 'rather', 'add', 'one', 'aged', 'very', 'well', 'especially', 'Kenshin.Though', 'normally', 'look', 'atmosphere', 'believe', 'would', 'be', 'mistake', 'not', 'very', 'least', 'mention', 'atmosphere', 'reflections', 'perfect', 'everything', 'contriputs', 'feel', 'sadness', 'regret.In', 'ending', 'want', 'see', 'how', 'things', 'end', 'buy', 'dvd', 'just', 'plan', 'enjoy', 'good', 'tragedy', 'buy', 'dvd', 'such', 'plan', 'good', 'story', 'buy', 'dvd', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'too', 'highly.Now', 'then', 'end', 'want', 'say', 'few', 'things', 'clear', 'up', 'missunderstandings', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'people', 'First', 'Kenshin', 'wonders', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'peace', 'thus', 'forced', 'wonder', 'Think', 'mans', 'got', 'ta', 'do', 'what', 'mans', 'got', 'ta', 'do', 'just', 'Second', 'Kenshin', ""n't"", 'return', 'leaving', 'poverity', 'ammenesia', 'forgiener', 'China', 'Chinese', 'Japonese', 'war', 'deseases', 'Third', 'Sonoaska', ""n't"", 'return', 'nothing', 'more', 'can', 'do', 'best', 'thing', 'could', 'do', 'honor', 'everything', 'Kenshin', 'meant', 'live', 'life', 'done', 'new', 'path', 'notice', 'trade', 'make', 'Bad', 'sign', 'gone', 'Fourth', 'why', 'did', 'Kenji', 'leave', 'home', 'Think', 'father', 'was', 'main', 'factor', 'brought', 'down', 'last', 'government', 'changed', 'course', 'history', 'was', 'one', 'greatest', 'swordsmen', 'have', 'ever', 'lived', 'just', 'wanted', 'get', 'know', 'father', 'strength', 'why', 'Yoheko', 'left', 'Kenshin', 'sword', 'night', 'samurai', 'sword', 'physical', 'embodiment', 'ideals', 'soul', 'away', 'heart', 'So', 'away', 'night', 'Kenji', 'was', 'having', 'father', 'son', 'talk', 'remembering', 'Kenshin', 'last', 'sword', 'fight', 'hope', 'helped']",N/A
733572,A2G3HEJ2WSRZVP,B0000844K0,Tivor,"[0, 2]","If you are new to Kenshin (or Samurai X, whatever), do NOT watch this.  This DVD contains what is essentially the END of the whole Kenshin storyline, and it contains a LOT of flashbacks to previous events.  If you are new to Kenshin, you should start by watching the Rurouni Kenshin TV series or the Trust &amp; Betrayal (aka Tsuiokuhen) OVA series.For those of you familiar with Kenshin, this DVD contains a 2-part Reflection OVA (aka Seisouhen) which takes place 15 years after the TV series.  Almost all of the 1st episode and about the half of the 2nd episode are recaps of everything that has happened in Kenshin previously, told somewhat through Kaoru's viewpoint.  The rest of the 2nd episode gives a nice, sentimental ending to the whole Kenshin saga.  In fact, the whole OVA is filled with nostalgic, sentimental atmosphere (fittingly, I suppose, since it IS mostly flashback), and although the action sequences are well-animated, you would not call this OVA &quot;action-packed.&quot;This OVA is obviously intended to give a sense of closure to the Kenshin saga, and it should be taken as such.  Now, some Kenshin fans may not be happy with the kind of closure this OVA gives, but I'll leave that up to you to decide.",4,Not for Kenshin newcomers,1051142400,"04 24, 2003",2003,1227,"['are', 'new', 'Kenshin', 'Samurai', 'X', 'do', 'NOT', 'watch', 'DVD', 'what', 'essentially', 'END', 'whole', 'Kenshin', 'storyline', 'LOT', 'flashbacks', 'previous', 'events', 'are', 'new', 'Kenshin', 'should', 'start', 'watching', 'Rurouni', 'Kenshin', 'TV', 'series', 'Trust', 'amp', 'Betrayal', 'Tsuiokuhen', 'OVA', 'series.For', 'familiar', 'Kenshin', 'DVD', '2-part', 'Reflection', 'OVA', 'Seisouhen', 'place', '15', 'years', 'TV', 'series', 'Almost', '1st', 'episode', 'half', '2nd', 'episode', 'are', 'recaps', 'everything', 'happened', 'Kenshin', 'previously', 'told', 'somewhat', 'Kaoru', 'viewpoint', 'rest', '2nd', 'episode', 'nice', 'sentimental', 'ending', 'whole', 'Kenshin', 'saga', 'fact', 'whole', 'OVA', 'filled', 'nostalgic', 'sentimental', 'atmosphere', 'fittingly', 'suppose', 'mostly', 'flashback', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'well-animated', 'would', 'not', 'call', 'OVA', 'quot', 'action-packed.', 'quot', 'OVA', 'obviously', 'intended', 'give', 'sense', 'closure', 'Kenshin', 'saga', 'should', 'be', 'taken', 'such', 'Now', 'Kenshin', 'fans', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'happy', 'kind', 'closure', 'OVA', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'up', 'decide']",N/A

Fans of the previous OVA will love this DVD. Fans of the TV show will have to put up with even more sappy stuff, but the OVA makes up for it with its awesome quality and good fight scenes. Plus, this is the only chance to see Enishi and Kenji in glorious animation, and we get to see Yahiko and Sano's evolution.But this does have flaws, first of all we need more Enishi, this guy is to awesome to get such limited scrren time in this series; second, the characters aren't very believable. After watching how some of the flashbacks actually ""happened"" in the TV series, the viewer feels like the characters are just acting in a play, instead of being themselves. The series has much better character development, since the OVA characters are just too dramatic. I was actually laughing on some of the so called ""flashbacks"" because some characters reacted totally different in most situations than how they did in the series. Maybe Kaoru just suffers from bad memory.This is still a must have title for Kenshin fans, fans of the OVA will love this sappy story, and TV fans get to see their loved characters in a less relaxed environment, but with better graphics and fighting.",4,"TV Series fans, be patient when you watch this",1048118400,"03 20, 2003",2003,1255,"['Yet', 'quality', 'product', 'people', 'who', 'brought', 'Trust', 'Betrayal', 'Fans', 'previous', 'OVA', 'will', 'love', 'DVD', 'Fans', 'TV', 'show', 'will', 'have', 'put', 'up', 'even', 'more', 'sappy', 'stuff', 'OVA', 'up', 'awesome', 'quality', 'good', 'fight', 'scenes', 'only', 'chance', 'see', 'Enishi', 'Kenji', 'glorious', 'animation', 'get', 'see', 'Yahiko', 'Sano', 'evolution.But', 'have', 'flaws', 'first', 'need', 'more', 'Enishi', 'guy', 'awesome', 'get', 'such', 'limited', 'scrren', 'time', 'series', 'second', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'believable', 'watching', 'how', 'flashbacks', 'actually', 'happened', 'TV', 'series', 'viewer', 'feels', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'acting', 'play', 'instead', 'being', 'series', 'much', 'better', 'character', 'development', 'OVA', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'dramatic', 'was', 'actually', 'laughing', 'so', 'called', 'flashbacks', 'characters', 'reacted', 'totally', 'different', 'most', 'situations', 'how', 'did', 'series', 'Maybe', 'Kaoru', 'just', 'suffers', 'bad', 'memory.This', 'still', 'must', 'have', 'title', 'Kenshin', 'fans', 'fans', 'OVA', 'will', 'love', 'sappy', 'story', 'TV', 'fans', 'get', 'see', 'loved', 'characters', 'less', 'relaxed', 'environment', 'better', 'graphics', 'fighting']",N/A
