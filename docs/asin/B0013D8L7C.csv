Never seen anything like it. I saw it in the theater and wanted very much to see it a second time, but by the time I had a chance it was too late. So, I'm looking forward to it's release on DVD at which time I will promptly order my copy. I say it deserved the best picture nomination and I said that as a great fan of NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN and MICHEAL CLAYTON. 2007 was an amazing year for the movies! On THAT I think we can all agree.Really this film largely has to do with the fabrication of social realities and personal identity, particularly through media. Do not expect a conventional movie here. This movie takes apart the standard biopic and rearranges the pieces, exploring and calling into question our perceptions. Dylan said he's ""got to be me, whoever that is"". He's got to be himself, whoever that is. This film shows that there is not really any ""self"" there that he is being or, at least, _has_ to be, in a certain sense.All the performances were great. Not just Cate Blanchett who did a marvelous and most memorable job and deserves the recognition. I wonder if we'll be able to forget her when we look at those old black and white photos and footage (particularly from DON'T LOOK BACK). All the portrayals of Dylan were fantastic. Heath Ledger was standout and, needless to say, it's heartbreaking watching his performance now. And (on a lighter note) you got to love David Cross as Allen Ginsberg.After having rambled on about all this, you can't leave out the music. If for nothing else, watch this movie for the music!",5,Best Picture of 2007,1205712000,"03 17, 2008",2008,1758,"['Should', 'have', 'least', 'been', 'nominated.If', 'have', 'interest', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'very', 'intelligent', 'strikingly', 'original', 'films', 'have', 'see', 'this.It', 'really', 'entertaining', 'fascinating', 'film', 'many', 'levels', 'Never', 'seen', 'anything', 'saw', 'theater', 'wanted', 'very', 'much', 'see', 'second', 'time', 'time', 'had', 'chance', 'was', 'too', 'late', 'So', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'release', 'DVD', 'time', 'will', 'promptly', 'order', 'copy', 'say', 'deserved', 'best', 'picture', 'nomination', 'said', 'great', 'fan', 'NO', 'COUNTRY', 'FOR', 'OLD', 'MEN', 'MICHEAL', 'CLAYTON', '2007', 'was', 'amazing', 'year', 'movies', 'think', 'can', 'agree.Really', 'film', 'largely', 'do', 'fabrication', 'social', 'realities', 'personal', 'identity', 'particularly', 'media', 'Do', 'not', 'expect', 'conventional', 'movie', 'here', 'movie', 'apart', 'standard', 'biopic', 'pieces', 'exploring', 'calling', 'question', 'perceptions', 'Dylan', 'said', 'got', 'be', 'whoever', 'got', 'be', 'whoever', 'film', 'not', 'really', 'self', 'there', 'being', 'least', '_has_', 'be', 'certain', 'performances', 'were', 'great', 'Not', 'just', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'who', 'did', 'marvelous', 'most', 'memorable', 'job', 'recognition', 'wonder', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'forget', 'when', 'look', 'old', 'black', 'white', 'photos', 'footage', 'particularly', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'LOOK', 'BACK', 'portrayals', 'Dylan', 'were', 'fantastic', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'was', 'standout', 'needless', 'say', 'heartbreaking', 'watching', 'performance', 'now', 'lighter', 'note', 'got', 'love', 'David', 'Cross', 'Allen', 'Ginsberg.After', 'having', 'rambled', 'ca', ""n't"", 'leave', 'out', 'music', 'nothing', 'else', 'watch', 'movie', 'music']",N/A
1140504,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B0013D8L7C,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[55, 59]","After `Don't Look Back' and Martin Scorsese's `No Direction Home'Bob Dylan - No Direction Homewhat's left?  With a subject as complex and multi-faceted as Dylan, it only makes sense to do more.  Just look at Dylan's memoir/autobiography, `Chronicles'.  We were given so much in Volume 1, but we know there's much more to come.  And that's just from him.  To capture all aspects of Dylan, there's `I'm Not There'.  With portrayals by six actors, each representing an aspect of his life, we get a Dylan mosaic that both blends and clashes.This is partly true because of Dylan himself, but it's also true because of the nature of the project.  At its best the movie is an effectively surreal portraiture.  At its worst it becomes a lingering still life that quickly needs the next piece in the gallery or provides some substandard reflections.  More than half of the songs are Dylan's originals, but some of the covers are fairly effective, too.  I was personally glad to have so many songs from his (subjectively greatest) masterpiece, 'Blonde on Blonde', but there is a wealth of material they use throughout.  Their selection is nearly flawless.One thing's for sure it's comprehensive.  Having read the first `Chronicles,' having seen the aforementioned films, and owning several of his recordings, most of the time director, Todd Haynes, is right on the money.  Not having read Dylan's own thoughts in 'Tarantula' or seen his portrayal in 'Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid' there are gaps that inevitably are provided for us.  Still, the mosaic of Dylan effectiveness depends on the actor as well as the scene.How does each actor do?  Marcus Carl Franklin is Woody, the young, aspiring Dylan.  It makes sense to have an African-American play the boy Dylan because in 'Chronicles'Chronicles: Volume One (Chronicles)his blues influences are amply noted, and we certainly know where the name came from.  Remembering Robert Shelton's reflections of among his first interviews, I thought the circus vagabond aspect of his life was pure folklore, but maybe even that fits.  Ben Whisham is Arthur Rimbaud, the rebel Dylan, facing a parole board before he's famous.  So far it's a good blend.Heath Ledger is Robbie Clark or Dylan, the lover and movie star.  This is the Dylan whose underbelly is shown to be chauvinistic at times, but also someone who yearns for a stable family life.  Picking Ledger makes sense.  Christian Bale is sometimes the stage Dylan (Jack Rollins), and, well...sometimes the born-again Christian (Pastor John).  Kate Blanchett is Jude Quinn, the incredulous rebel interviewee who refuses to be pigeon-holed or answer questions based on the elders' self-centered assumptions.  Comparing 'Don't Look Back'Bob Dylan - Don't Look Back (Single Disc Remastered Edition)she's dead on.  Both Jack Rollins and Jude Quinn represent the controversial period when Dylan went electric, and some of the best scenes are found during this era.I came shocked and surprised coming into the movie noting there was a woman playing the part.  I gave myself a pep talk to keep an open mind, and found her the most convincing Dylan.  Ledger and Bale have their moments, but my biggest problem is that I kept thinking of Heath Ledger and Christian Bale more often than I thought of Dylan. Richard Gere plays the Dylan role in the movie `Pat Garrett...'Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid (Two-Disc Special Edition).  Here he's Billy the Kid.  He looked like Dylan, but reminded me the least of him.The supporting players are essential.  Julianne Moore is one of the best in the show as Alice Fabian (Joan Baez).  Matching her is Charlotte Gainsbourg as Claire (Sarah) his wife.  The playful vignettes with The Beatles and Alan Ginsberg are a joy to watch.  Dylan's manager, Morris Bernstein (Albert Grossman), is represented as every bit as protective, resourceful, and demanding as one would expect.  One of the best scenes is with needling newspaper man, Keenan Jones (or ""Mr. Jones"" if you will) played by Bruce Greenwood.This biopic blends more than not.  Their methods seem better than the random hop-scotch 'La Vie en Rose (Extended Version)' tends to do.  Especially when we're at a chic cocktail party, and we see all kinds of images projected fully on the walls; it's very well done.  Jerry Rabinowicz's editing does much for the flow of scenes, except when the 'Pat Garrett' scenes lingered too long, and when the criss-cross of time frames and aspects of his life were distracting and lacked focus.Despite its flaws, 'I'm Not There' is a brave and magnetic portraiture of Bob Dylan.  As a bold experiment it mostly succeeds and satisfies.  The very fact that the 2:15 movie makes as few demands as it does on its audience shows that the results are a labor of love that mostly ring true.",4,Dylan Mosaic Blends and Clashes,1198540800,"12

For those (such as myself) that know only very few tidbits gathered from Wikipedia, there is an enormous amount of confusing material, particularly the entire Richard Gere subplot.Cate Blanchett is remarkable in her portrayal of Dylan - not only is she convincing as a man, but she embodies Dylan's speech, smoking (although the cigarette is never lit for some reason), and looks more like him than any other of the Dylan representations.The opening sequence is done incredibly well, with a creative display of the title. The rest of the movie is filled with artsiness, for better or worse.Ultimately, what Todd Hayes attempts and succeeds in doing is what Tobby Litt discusses in relation to writing about Franz Kafka, ""And all of these interpretations are in themselves wrong, and yet there is always a chance that one combination of them might touch the truth closer than any other.""

1140508,AGEIT17HENDIS,B0013D8L7C,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 0]","If you want Bob Dylan at the beginning, the middle (or middles) and as he moves toward the end of his career this film is for you-if you have decoder ring. After having been introduced to Bob Dylan's music in the early folk revival days of the 1960s, having gone on with him through the folk rock days, moved away during his preacher Bob days and have come back to his music now that he is in his dotage (otherwise known as the endless tour) it is rather nice for someone to be thoughtful enough to do a little cinematic bio of the man who has been hailed as a cultural icon.And after watching this film is that still true? A bio you say? Of who, you say? Well, I didn't say that it was a standard cookie- cutter bio sketch of the many lives of a performer who has been doing it for over forty years, warts and all. No, this is more in the realm of high camp, low camp, surrealism, name games and just pure whimsy as director Todd Haynes (apparently with Dylan's approval) has set up an allegory of the six main lives of Dylan. And it works. Let's put it this way. If you want a standard bio there are many, many good film documentaries out there (especially from the British) that chronicle one aspect or another of the ups and downs of Dylan's recording career. Here we have a puzzle to solve, Dylan from bright young talent to old time Western codger (played by Richard Gere).Although I would not really suggest this thing for novices, every aficionado should be viewing this thing more than once. I might add that between covers of his music by the likes of Richie Havens (a fantastic version of ""Tombstone Blues"" done with one of Dylan's personas) and a sound track filled with his own performances is worth the price of admission. Moreover, Cate Blanchett's performance as Dylan in his turning folk electric period of the mid-1960s is better than... Dylan's.

What shapes a person's perspective and pushes him or her to express their soul? This is not a movie that goes from point A to B, so if you go in expecting that, it would be a confusing disappointment.To me, the movie described how Dylan was influenced by sources outside himself, and how it all melded inside him and then in his passion, he could express himself in his own unique way. Which is what we all do when we create, don't we? Even if not creative geniuses, we are all products of our pasts, dreams, memories, wishes, and present experiencesIt was magical to me how the actors and actresses took their own influences and melded those things to help them create their characters, their essences.Fantastic score- a mix of Dylan's recordings and other fine artists covering his songs. The only actor who sang was the brilliant 13 year old Marcus Carl Franklin who played Woody Guthrie. Breathtaking acting skills and singing, Marcus was channeling something beyond his years.The others lip sinc'd, but were so convincing.Cate Blanchett was incredible, she used just enough of Dylan's vocal style and body movements to create him as an androgynous tortured soul, but she didn't impersonate him. She was using herself to create the essence of how she perceived him.Heath Ledger, all I could keep thinking while admiring his sensitivity and quiet depth was "" Forever Young""... Charlotte Gainsbourg was perfect, such expressions in her eyes and unusually beautiful face.I would highly recommend first reading Dylan's own book Chronicles, before you see this movie. His book explains so beautifully his passions and influences, and that knowledge helped me go with the flow...I think I might have been a little more mystified had I not read it. Also watch the Martin Scorsese documentary. It all helped me to get into the feeling place to experience the movie, and above all Dylan's music, on an emotional non-linear level.I would also recommend letting go of logic and then give the movie a try, just relax into it as if in a dream.",5,The parts create a mysterious whole,1210550400,"05 12, 2008",2008,2129,"['complex', 'very', 'artful', 'movie', 'captured', 'elusive', 'spirit', 'what', 'person', 'create', 'What', 'person', 'perspective', 'express', 'soul', 'not', 'movie', 'point', 'B', 'so', 'go', 'expecting', 'would', 'be', 'confusing', 'disappointment.To', 'movie', 'described', 'how', 'Dylan', 'was', 'influenced', 'sources', 'how', 'melded', 'then', 'passion', 'could', 'express', 'own', 'unique', 'way', 'Which', 'what', 'do', 'when', 'create', 'do', ""n't"", 'Even', 'not', 'creative', 'geniuses', 'are', 'products', 'pasts', 'dreams', 'memories', 'wishes', 'present', 'experiencesIt', 'was', 'magical', 'how', 'actors', 'actresses', 'took', 'own', 'influences', 'melded', 'things', 'help', 'create', 'characters', 'essences.Fantastic', 'score-', 'mix', 'Dylan', 'recordings', 'other', 'fine', 'artists', 'covering', 'songs', 'only', 'actor', 'who', 'sang', 'was', 'brilliant', '13', 'year', 'old', 'Marcus', 'Carl', 'Franklin', 'who', 'played', 'Woody', 'Guthrie', 'Breathtaking', 'acting', 'skills', 'singing', 'Marcus', 'was', 'channeling', 'something', 'years.The', 'others', 'lip', 'sinc', ""'d"", 'were', 'so', 'convincing.Cate', 'Blanchett', 'was', 'incredible', 'used', 'just', 'enough', 'Dylan', 'vocal', 'style', 'body', 'movements', 'create', 'androgynous', 'tortured', 'soul', 'did', ""n't"", 'impersonate', 'was', 'using', 'create', 'essence', 'how', 'perceived', 'him.Heath', 'Ledger', 'could', 'keep', 'thinking', 'admiring', 'sensitivity', 'quiet', 'depth', 'was', 'Forever', 'Young', 'Charlotte', 'Gainsbourg', 'was', 'perfect', 'such', 'expressions', 'eyes', 'unusually', 'beautiful', 'face.I', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'first', 'reading', 'Dylan', 'own', 'book', 'Chronicles', 'see', 'movie', 'book', 'so', 'beautifully', 'passions', 'influences', 'knowledge', 'helped', 'go', 'flow', 'think', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'more', 'mystified', 'had', 'not', 'read', 'Also', 'watch', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'documentary', 'helped', 'get', 'feeling', 'place', 'experience', 'movie', 'Dylan', 'music', 'emotional', 'non-linear', 'level.I', 'would', 'also', 'recommend', 'letting', 'go', 'logic', 'then', 'give', 'movie', 'try', 'just', 'relax', 'dream']",N/A
1140510,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0013D8L7C,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","I chuck a lot of my confusion with this film up to the fact that I am not really all that familiar with Bob Dylan's music.  In fact, it wasn't his name that drew me to this film; it was the conceptual design of director Todd Haynes, a man that I have come to respect and admire as an artist.  Knowing that the film is inspired, not by Dylan's life but by his music has led me to believe that until I really sit down and listen to the man's body of work my perception of this film will continue to be rather cloudy.So, if you are not familiar with Dylan then maybe you'll want to skip this one.Conceptually I feel that this film is pure genius.  Haynes idea behind capturing Dylan's life through interpretations of his music is just beyond original; and casting six (seven if you consider Kris Kristofferson's narrative another `Dylan') actors to portray the man in the many forms of his persona was yet another stroke of genius.  This is where my frustration lies with the film though, because it really should have been brilliant and yet, when all is said and done, it feels incomplete.Shuffling our attention from actor to actor, establishing storyline upon storyline, the film fails to establish a cognitive theme; a cohesive line of thought to act as some connective tissue, tying the whole film together.  Instead it comes off as a series of short films played back to back, at times even weaving in and out of one another.  It hurts me to think that this put a damper on the film, because it is this very uniqueness that sets this apart from all the other biopic films out there, the Walk the Line's and the Ray's.  The fact remains though, that because of the films lack of structure it leaves the audience even more confused about just who this man really was then we were before we ever sat down to watch it.  Sure, like I mentioned, this is more a story about his music than a story about the man himself, but we should gather some insight as to who he was as an artist, and I feel that we don't get that when `I'm Not There' is finished.There are so many good things about this movie though, so that is why I'm torn as to my true feelings on the film as a whole.  The acting across the board is sensational.  Cate Blanchett truly deserved that Oscar nomination, for her portrayal of Jude is as riveting as they come.  She completely embodies this man, fully immersing into her character to create something real, something pure.  I remember when Billy Bush (what an idiot) cracked on her for winning the Golden Globe, saying that her performance was all gimmick because she was a `woman playing a man'.  Hey, I have been one to call out actors for playing gimmicks before (Tom Hanks anyone) but this is so much more than just a one-note, gimmicky performance.  She transcends gimmick, adding layer upon layer to her character.  She is not the only great performance here though.  In fact, everyone that plays a variation of Dylan is superb, especially Marcus Carl Franklin and Heath Ledger.  Michelle Williams and Charlotte Gainsbourg are also outstanding as woman in and around this man at some point in his career (both playing fictitious characters inspired by real acquaintances).Like I said, the film is a conceptual marvel.  Not just the idea behind the script, but the idea behind the vignettes (can we call them that?) is also outstanding.  Todd Haynes creates differing moods inspired by other directory marvels for each of his storylines, borrowing from Fellini and Godard and Peckinpah, lending each character his own world to dwell in.  Every facet of this film is primed and ready for greatness, so it kills me that this film did not mesh together as well as it should have.  Quite honestly, with how excited I am about this film in parts you'd think that it was my favorite film of 2007, and really, it should have been.Sadly, it is not.This is still a must see as far as I am concerned, and I hope that after I really get into listening to Bob Dylan's music I can revisit this film and find a greater appreciation for it.  Maybe then it will all come together for me.  Haynes is an amazing director, an amazing artist and this is proof that he has what it takes to become legend.  A little structure would have really elevated this film and brought it to masterpiece levels.  I'm going to give it a B, even though part of me wants to give it an A for effort and the other part wants to give it a C for failing to live up to its potential.  I'll settle somewhere in the middle.",4,There is too much genius here for it to be so uneven...,1242864000,"05 21, 2009",2009,4502,"['chuck', 'lot', 'confusion', 'film', 'up', 'fact', 'am', 'not', 'really', 'familiar', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'music', 'fact', 'was', ""n't"", 'name', 'drew', 'film', 'was', 'conceptual', 'design', 'director', 'Todd', 'Haynes', 'man', 'have', 'come', 'respect', 'admire', 'artist', 'Knowing', 'film', 'inspired', 'not', 'Dylan', 'life', 'music', 'led', 'believe', 'really', 'sit', 'down', 'listen', 'man', 'body', 'work', 'perception', 'film', 'will', 'continue', 'be', 'rather', 'cloudy.So', 'are', 'not', 'familiar', 'Dylan', 'then', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'want', 'skip', 'one.Conceptually', 'feel', 'film', 'pure', 'genius', 'Haynes', 'idea', 'capturing', 'Dylan', 'life', 'interpretations', 'music', 'just', 'original', 'casting', 'six', 'seven', 'consider', 'Kris', 'Kristofferson', 'narrative', 'Dylan', 'actors', 'portray', 'man', 'many', 'forms', 'persona', 'was', 'yet', 'stroke', 'genius', 'where', 'frustration', 'film', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'brilliant', 'yet', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'incomplete.Shuffling', 'attention', 'actor', 'actor', 'establishing', 'storyline', 'storyline', 'film', 'establish', 'cognitive', 'theme', 'cohesive', 'line', 'thought', 'act', 'connective', 'tissue', 'tying', 'whole', 'film', 'together', 'Instead', 'off', 'series', 'short', 'films', 'played', 'back', 'back', 'times', 'even', 'weaving', 'one', 'think', 'put', 'damper', 'film', 'very', 'uniqueness', 'apart', 'other', 'biopic', 'films', 'there', 'Walk', 'Line', 'Ray', 'fact', 'films', 'lack', 'structure', 'audience', 'even', 'more', 'confused', 'just', 'who', 'man', 'really', 'was', 'then', 'were', 'ever', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'Sure', 'mentioned', 'more', 'story', 'music', 'story', 'man', 'should', 'gather', 'insight', 'who', 'was', 'artist', 'feel', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'when', ""'m"", 'Not', 'finished.There', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'good', 'things', 'movie', 'why', ""'m"", 'torn', 'true', 'feelings', 'film', 'whole', 'acting', 'board', 'sensational', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'truly', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'portrayal', 'Jude', 'as', 'riveting', 'come', 'completely', 'man', 'fully', 'immersing', 'character', 'create', 'something', 'real', 'something', 'pure', 'remember', 'when', 'Billy', 'Bush', 'what', 'idiot', 'cracked', 'winning', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'saying', 'performance', 'was', 'gimmick', 'was', 'woman', 'playing', 'man', 'Hey', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'call', 'out', 'actors', 'playing', 'gimmicks', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'anyone', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'one-note', 'gimmicky', 'performance', 'gimmick', 'adding', 'layer', 'layer', 'character', 'not', 'only', 'great', 'performance', 'here', 'fact', 'everyone', 'variation', 'Dylan', 'superb', 'especially', 'Marcus', 'Carl', 'Franklin', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'Charlotte', 'Gainsbourg', 'are', 'also', 'outstanding', 'woman', 'man', 'point', 'career', 'playing', 'fictitious', 'characters', 'inspired', 'real', 'acquaintances', '.Like', 'said', 'film', 'conceptual', 'marvel', 'Not', 'just', 'idea', 'script', 'idea', 'vignettes', 'can', 'call', 'also', 'outstanding', 'Todd', 'Haynes', 'differing', 'moods', 'inspired', 'other', 'directory', 'marvels', 'storylines', 'borrowing', 'Fellini', 'Godard', 'Peckinpah', 'lending', 'character', 'own', 'world', 'dwell', 'facet', 'film', 'primed', 'ready', 'greatness', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'mesh', 'together', 'as', 'well', 'should', 'have', 'Quite', 'honestly', 'how', 'excited', 'am', 'film', 'parts', ""'d"", 'think', 'was', 'favorite', 'film', '2007', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'been.Sadly', 'not.This', 'still', 'must', 'see', 'as', 'far', 'am', 'concerned', 'hope', 'really', 'get', 'listening', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'music', 'can', 'revisit', 'film', 'find', 'greater', 'appreciation', 'Maybe', 'then', 'will', 'come', 'together', 'Haynes', 'amazing', 'director', 'amazing', 'artist', 'proof', 'what', 'become', 'legend', 'little', 'structure', 'would', 'have', 'really', 'elevated', 'film', 'brought', 'masterpiece', 'levels', ""'m"", 'going', 'give', 'B', 'even', 'part', 'give', 'A', 'effort', 'other', 'part', 'give', 'C', 'failing', 'live', 'up', 'potential', ""'ll"", 'settle', 'somewhere', 'middle']",N/A

1140512,A2582KMXLK2P06,B0013D8L7C,B. E Jackson,"[1, 2]","There's one *extremely* important thing about I'm Not There that you absolutely MUST know. It's a film that's quite confusing to understand because it focuses on very specific details about Dylan's adventurous life from the mid to late 60's.I was honestly quite confused watching this film, especially in the very beginning. I didn't get the Jack Rollins segments, or the little kid riding a train with a guitar and a talented singing voice. These parts went completely over my head, however, I'm not someone who knows a whole lot about Dylan's background- I just listen to his (absolutely terrific) music.  I love Blonde on Blonde, Blood on the Tracks and Desire for example.Now another problem with the film (perhaps an even bigger problem) is that Bob Dylan himself is a *very* complex individual. Most of his lines in the movie were pretty accurate as far as what he's actually like in real life- pretty darn confusing to understand. His lyrics and his music make sense, but his interviews are quite mind-bogglingly difficult to figure out.Trying to understand exactly where Dylan stands on certain issues can be quite the challenge because, let's be honest, he's significantly more intelligent than the average person (like me, for example). This means I'm Not There is loaded with hard to comprehend segments that the average person won't get.  Asking Dylan a straight question just result in a really complicated answer.Make sure before watching I'm Not There that you have a really thorough knowledge of his life (especially his 60's period) because if you don't, you'll probably be sitting there really confused like I was.As for all the actors who portrayed Bob Dylan... was that really necessary? I think it would have been better to settle on just one person even if that one person doesn't quite match the appearance and personality of the ever-changing Dylan figure. That's what I think at least.However, all these actors are good in their performance.  I can totally believe that Dylan WAS exactly like how the actors portrayed him to be.Just keep in mind this movie is not for the average fan- it's for HUGE Dylan fans.",5,it's good but...,1283212800,"08 31, 2010",2010,2135,"['one', '*extremely*', 'important', 'thing', ""'m"", 'Not', 'absolutely', 'MUST', 'know', 'film', 'quite', 'confusing', 'understand', 'very', 'specific', 'details', 'Dylan', 'adventurous', 'life', 'mid', 'late', ""60's.I"", 'was', 'honestly', 'quite', 'confused', 'watching', 'film', 'especially', 'very', 'beginning', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'Jack', 'Rollins', 'segments', 'little', 'kid', 'riding', 'train', 'guitar', 'talented', 'singing', 'voice', 'parts', 'went', 'completely', 'head', 'however', ""'m"", 'not', 'someone', 'who', 'whole', 'lot', 'Dylan', 'background-', 'just', 'listen', 'absolutely', 'terrific', 'music', 'love', 'Blonde', 'Blonde', 'Blood', 'Tracks', 'Desire', 'example.Now', 'problem', 'film', 'perhaps', 'even', 'bigger', 'problem', 'Bob', 'Dylan', '*very*', 'complex', 'individual', 'Most', 'lines', 'movie', 'were', 'pretty', 'accurate', 'as', 'far', 'what', 'actually', 'like', 'real', 'life-', 'pretty', 'darn', 'confusing', 'understand', 'lyrics', 'music', 'make', 'sense', 'interviews', 'are', 'quite', 'mind-bogglingly', 'difficult', 'figure', 'out.Trying', 'understand', 'exactly', 'where', 'Dylan', 'certain', 'issues', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'challenge', 'let', 'be', 'honest', 'significantly', 'more', 'intelligent', 'average', 'person', 'example', ""'m"", 'Not', 'loaded', 'hard', 'comprehend', 'segments', 'average', 'person', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'Asking', 'Dylan', 'straight', 'question', 'just', 'result', 'really', 'complicated', 'answer.Make', 'sure', 'watching', ""'m"", 'Not', 'have', 'really', 'thorough', 'knowledge', 'life', 'especially', '60', 'period', 'do', ""n't"", ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', 'sitting', 'there', 'really', 'confused', 'was.As', 'actors', 'who', 'portrayed', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'was', 'really', 'necessary', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'settle', 'just', 'one', 'person', 'even', 'one', 'person', ""n't"", 'quite', 'match', 'appearance', 'personality', 'ever-changing', 'Dylan', 'figure', 'what', 'think', 'least.However', 'actors', 'are', 'good', 'performance', 'can', 'totally', 'believe', 'Dylan', 'WAS', 'exactly', 'how', 'actors', 'portrayed', 'be.Just', 'keep', 'mind', 'movie', 'not', 'average', 'fan-', 'HUGE', 'Dylan', 'fans']",N/A
1140513,A1EKTLUL24HDG8,B0013D8L7C,Bill R. Moore,"[0, 0]","Few people are more ripe for a biopic than Bob Dylan, especially an unconventional one, and Todd Hanyes - a serious fan experienced in films with musical subjects- seems a good directing choice. Let me say right out that I am a major Dylan fan; I own not only the official canon but hundreds of bootlegs, have attended numerous shows, have a wealth of books and other non-music merchandise, have reviewed dozens of Dylan-related items on Amazon, and have even written a fifteen hundred page book about his songs, while Dylan has influenced my own poems. I say this to ensure everyone that I am not trashing the film automatically or without reason, because trash it I must. My hopes were high, but it is a colossal failure as both Dylan film and film per se. Only true Dylan hard-cores will find it even remotely appealing, but I urge even them to resist, and everyone else should stay far, far away.I will start with the good, because there is not much. Some of the acting is excellent, even superb, and nearly all of it is good. Cate Blanchett got nearly all the attention and certainly deserved much; her 1966 era Dylan is near-perfect - one of the best cross-gender performances ever and fine in itself. However, Marcus Carl Franklin is nearly as good, and his performance is truly admirable considering his age. Ben Whishaw's Dylan/Rimbaud character is fairly good as far as it goes, and the small roles are nearly all spot-on. The real weak point is Christian Bale, unfortunately the only actor to attempt two sides of Dylan; his born again Christian persona is generally convincing, but the folkie character is almost risibly bad. Also unsatisfying is Charlotte Gainsbourg as the love interest; she fails to convey why she would attract a brilliant artist and is not likable or interesting enough for us to care much about her mistreatment. Her on again, off again French accent is also bizarre and highly distracting. On a more positive note, recreations of actual physical scenes are well-done. Finally, of course, the music is good - though not even as good as it could have been. Dylan's performances are inevitably great and generally well-chosen. ""Blind Willie McTell,"" the little-known ""Trouble in Mind,"" and a non-album ""Idiot"" Wind"" are particularly effective, and the previously unreleased title cut is a welcome masterpiece in the making, while the inevitable ""I Want You"" sex scene is more effective than expected. The numerous covers are more mixed; none come close to the originals except Jim James' profoundly emotional ""Goin' to Acapulco"" with Calexico and John Doe's powerhouse ""Pressing On,"" which features in one of the best scenes, but a few others are at least effective. The early acoustic songs are adequate but really nothing more than pale imitations; Dylan's should simply have been used. Far more annoying are horrendous takes on ""All along the Watchtower"" and ""Ballad of a Thin Man,"" the latter being so bad that it ruins what would have been one of the best scenes.Now to the problems. The most obvious and fundamental is that this is perhaps the most ""in"" film ever made. It is not enough to be intimately familiar with Dylan's art and life; one must know interviews, rumors, myths, criticism, and practically everything else.  I have seen non-fans try watching I'm, and they were completely lost, giving up after a few minutes. For example, casuals could easily realize that the character Jude Quinn is named after Dylan's famous song ""Quinn the Eskimo,"" but few can be expected to know that the revelation of his real last name as Edelstein refers to one of Dylan's maternal ancestors. One could of course argue this is not a problem because I'm primarily targets Dylan hard-cores, but it sought widespread critical acclaim and aimed to a certain extent at general viewers, making the minutia puzzling at best.Another major problem is that there is simply no story. Squeezing Dylan's long, storied career into a film even approaching normal length is course impossible, but Haynes' baffling approach is a poor compromise. He has different actors represent different aspects of Dylan's life and personality - a novel idea and perhaps the only workable one. It is easy to take issue with the angles chosen and hard not to notice that nearly the last thirty years are absent, but the eras are broadly representative. The real problem is execution. I'm is not a film so much as a series of disconnected snapshots; the glimpses are sometimes interesting but never make a meaningful whole. Haynes indeed hardly even seems to try connecting them; the blending finale is ingenious but near-laughably superficial. It is as if he realized his film does not hold together and made a last desperate push to correct - too little, too late, needless to say. Richard Gere's part is the most frustrating; some have touted it as the key, but there is little real effort to connect to Dylan, much less the rest of the film, and non-fans will be hopelessly lost. The section is so thoroughly beguiling that it is virtually impossible to judge Gere's performance. More importantly, the whole film suffers from lack of drama; there is nothing to keep us interested and - aside from the scene with Ginsberg at a crucifix - an absence of humor, which Dylan nearly always makes sure to have.But, some may object, I'm is not meant as a straight biopic. Indeed it is not one, and those unfamiliar with Dylan's attitude toward his legacy - ambivalent at best, often seemingly perverse - will be shocked that he approved. Heath Ledger's character is after all extremely unflattering - nay, thoroughly dislikable - with very little factual basis, as is the darker side of Blanchett's, which prominently includes unconfirmed drug use. Most offensive of all is that Haynes has the folkie Dylan character use racial slurs; the event depicted was disastrous but not in this way. Dylan is far from a perfect man, and I'm should be applauded for not being hagiographic like so many presentations, but it sometimes seems as if slander was Haynes' goal. There is a strange negativity focus and very little appreciation for what makes Dylan's art so great and important. His art is indeed barely even present; I'm often degenerates into a gossip fest rather than a biography of a great artist, however intentionally tangential. In addition, there is no new insight into Dylan the man or Dylan the artist. We can only wonder what Haynes was trying to do. However, such non-canonical elements must be weighed beside the plethora of esoteric trivia. Haynes tries to have it both ways and does neither well.Part of the reason I'm is not a straight biopic is that it tries very hard - far too hard - to also be an art film. Film connoisseurs will notice tributes to classic art film directors, several of them admired by Dylan as well as Haynes, but they are simply a poor fit. Most of these elements - the drowning scene, the tarantula, etc. - are presumably meant to lend an appropriate surrealist air but are in reality only distracting. Haynes clearly wanted something infinitely more artistic than the likes of Walk the Line, but I'm is far less entertaining and moving - and even less informative - without being thought-provoking, aesthetic, or whatever else it is supposed to be. This reinforces the only reasonable conclusion one can make - Haynes should either have made a straight biopic or an art film that did not pretend to be a biopic rather than this wretched Frankenstein's monster hybrid.",2,"Good Idea, Horrible Execution",1271030400,"04 12, 2010",2010,7502,"['Few', 'people', 'are', 'more', 'ripe', 'biopic', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'especially', 'unconventional',

This is simply a beautiful art film in many ways. If you want a documentary on Dylan, this is not it. Instead, this is simply a mostly fictional cross section between what the media has made of Dylan, what the fans think of Dylan and how Haynes sees Dylan.

And what I mean by ""insiders"" is that if you're not in-the-know of what Bob Dylan was like and how his life meted itself out, you'll probably be scratching your head rather than applauding (with one notable exception which we'll cover in a moment).Six separate actors (and an actress) portray Dylan as he remakes himself during times of tumult and exacerbation. The first is young black (yes, black) Woody (Marcus Carl Franklin), a train-jumping blues-boy who tries to focus on music of the past rather than the present. When he fails to make it, he must move on and reinvent himself. And the incarnations are many and bewildering (not unlike the man himself). From the pensive Jack (Christian Bale,3:10 to Yuma), to the brutally uncompromising Robbie (Heath Ledger,The Dark Knight), to the solemn Billy (Richard Gere,The Flock), Dylan's music changed with his personae, and a barrage of his songs carry throughout the production.The big failing of I'm Not There, though, is it's pacing, it's unfocused time-line, and the inability of many watchers to understand where, how, and when we are. Although this style was also a plus in that it created an original format (like Dylan himself), it leant itself to extreme confusion. I hope some people out there aren't watching and positively reviewing this movie simply because they don't want to be seen as ""musically uneducated"" or ""art handicapped."" Sometimes the ""I don't understand what this was so it must be good"" attitude pops up at times like these. But sometimes confusion is simply that: confusion.But there is a shining moment that stands out amidst these bizarre sequences, and that radiant star is Cate Blanchett (Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull) as the uneffeminate Jude (Dylan's drug infested wonderlust time). Blanchett's performance was striking in that one never questions her masculinity nor her Dylanesque personae. Her win at the Golden Globes (2008) for Best Supporting Actress was no surprise, nor was her nomination in the same category at the Oscars. Nor her many, many, many, many wins at film festivals across the globe.I'm giving the film a positive rating based on Blanchett's astounding performance, which blew my mind. I know. I know.

Just look how easy it was a few years ago to get a dozen major stars to participate in the bizarre mess of Masked and Anonymous just because Bob himself starred in it (and probably wrote it). Same thing here. Unfortunately my opinion of I'm Not There is that it is generally pointless and sadly lacking in contrast to the man's own art. The film was obviously written by a Dylan devotee. Hardcore Bob fans will see dozens of references to song lyrics, Bob on film and even obscure bootlegs. The problem with all of it is simply that it is not even close to comparing with the original. I can't stress enough - NOT EVEN CLOSE, to the point where most of the film is marginally painful to watch. I'm not a Dylan worshipper, just a fan for about 25 years but Bob Dylan is so much more interesting to watch and hear compared to the performances here. Every time a genuine Dylan song sung by Dylan was played it felt like a breath of fresh air just came in. The stilted acting makes one long for the actual footage of Bob himself onstage, in press conferences and in the documentaries out there like Dont Look Back and No Direction Home. The other embarrassing aspect of this film is that many scenes are played out too long so that everything can be explained, and the Dylan character can be wrapped up in a nice little gift box for us moviegoers who may be too stupid to understand the real Dylan (this is especially true with the Cate Blanchett scenes). Insulting to us and even more so to Dylan himself. I will say that I thought the Richard Gere segments pretty interesting, probably because he wasn't trying to directly imitate Dylan. If you're somewhat new to Bob Dylan and liked this film let me offer some advice - Buy the 4 hour Martin Scorsese produced documentary No Direction Home. Bob himself is here for the whole thing both in glorious flashbacks and as a present-day piercing-blue-eyed 60-something year old.

I'm Not There invites us into Bob Dylan's brain and has look at the world through his eyes. We also see how Dylan is perceived by the media and his fans. Because Haynes is pushing the genre to its extremes the film is quite hard to follow at times as we jump all over the place in time and are confronted by various takes on Dylan. However, I think it is a film that will only improves on subsequent viewings as what Haynes is doing becomes more apparent and understood.On the first disc there is ""An Introduction"" featuring four text essays that help one get a handle on the film. ""Who's Not There: Six Faces of Dylan"" explains who each of the six Dylans the actors are playing and what they represent. ""Tangled Up in Clues"" claims that Haynes' film is ""an homage to 1960s art films."" It does an excellent job of breaking the film down to its basic elements. ""Decoding an Entertaining Enigma"" examines each incarnation of Dylan in the film. ""Notes on I'm Not There"" is written by noted critic Greil Marcus and features a solid analysis of the film.There is an audio commentary by co-writer/director Todd Haynes. He talks about how he rediscovered Bob Dylan's music and his life via biographies. Haynes talks about how he pitched the project to Dylan and how he was inspired by the cinema of the 1960s because that was the time period where most of the film was set. Haynes certainly knows his Dylan history and does a great job analyzing his film and talking about the changes he made while shooting it. This is an engaging and informative track.There is also an option to have the lyrics to the songs that appear on-screen.The second disc features two theatrical trailers and an unreleased flash card trailer done in the style of the famous ""Subterranean Homesick Blues"" video with the cast.There are ""Audition Tapes"" for Marcus Carl Franklin and Ben Whishaw. They both do a good job embodying the character they would eventually play.Also included are two deleted scenes with Blanchett as Dylan messed up on drugs and another with Gere as Dylan during his western phase.There are four alternate/extended scenes that provide an interesting, different take on these scenes.An ""Outtakes"" gag reel features the cast and crew goofing around.""A Tribute to Heath Ledger"" features a montage of clips of the late actor in character and on the set. It is a sobering reminder of what a great talent has been lost with his tragic death.""The Red Carpet Premiere"" in November 2007 features footage of Haynes and his cast walking the red carpet and interacting with the press.""Making the Soundtrack"" examines how they mixed covers of Dylan's songs with original versions by the man himself. Haynes enlisted Sonic Youth's Lee Ronaldo to supervise some of the music and musicians like John Doe recorded their versions of key songs in the film. Assembling the soundtrack was as unconventional as the film itself.""Conversation with Todd Haynes"" features the director going in detail about his film explaining the title, the origins of the project, and so on. It's a nice compliment to his commentary track even if there is some overlap.""Dylanography"" includes the one-page proposal Haynes sent Dylan in order to get his approval for the film.

Does that make much sense?  I suppose not...nor does this movie, really.See how I tied all that together?  Just like Dylan--except, you know, Dylan's GOOD at such things, and I rather lack the knack for it.""I'm Not There.""  It's a bold statement for the film-makers to make...but they manage to back it up.  How else could you tell the story of Bob Dylan, one of the most loved/hated/complicated/simple musicians of all time.  The story is told in allegory, of course--and most of it isn't meant to make much sense, so really, don't bother to try.  If you're a huge Dylan fan, then go ahead and pour over the details, draw your comparisons, work it all out in your head.  For those of you who don't like Dylan--why, again, are you watching this?--or for those of you in my situation...well, you can marvel at the performances.  Cate Blanchett is rivetting.  Christian Bale is a wonder.  Heath Ledger is interesting to watch, even if we wind up seeing more of him that we (or most of us, at least) wanted to.  Kris Kristofferon's narration could have used more air time...got my hopes, for a minute there.  Bruce Greenwood is sinister (is he ever not?).  Richard Gere charms, even if his segment is perhaps the weakest of them.  There is humor and heart here...there is also coldness and despair, even a sense of incompletion (as it should be; after all, Dylan's still here, and even after he's gone, his legacy will remain).  This film may not be classic...but it's just this side of it.  Perhaps, one day, it will slip across the line.  Let's just wait and see, shall we?P.S. The movie has a killer soundtrack.

We know him as Bob Dylan, a name he assumed in 1962, and everyone knows his music when they hear it. But knowing the man has remained a quixotic quest. This unusual film combines clever artistic sophistication with musical nostalgia but fails badly to shed any light on the ""real"" Dylan. Perhaps that was not the film's purpose, or perhaps its purpose was to present Dylan's personality as badly fragmented. Six different actors play six different Dylans, including Cate Blanchett who was nominated for an Oscar for her role. But we're never told any of the characters is Bob Dylan, so if you don't know this in advance you'll be lost. The six characters have different names and different stories that aren't related but instead jump back and forth in a non-linear fashion. All six Dylans make him sound like a cult-like philosopher who only spoke in mysterious Zen-Like koans. Some of what they portray follows Dylan's real life, like his conversion to Christianity or his periods of obscurity, but other parts are entirely fictional (becoming a movie star).

He disdains it. he wrote an entire CD insert (World Gone Wrong) attesting to the loss of actual truth in the world.

1140528,A280GY5UVUS2QH,B0013D8L7C,Doug Anderson,"[25, 37]","Less a biopic and more an exploration of postmod identity, Haynes attempts to bring both Dylan (all six of him) and pomo into the American consciousness (once again) but really only ends up making Dylan look like a bratty, self-centered, and pretensious put-on artist. I think the film makes it seem as though Dylan was only interested in myth-making, namely his own, but Dylan was/is poplar not because he is a celebrity but because of what he says about American life. The most fascinating and most enigmatic Dylan-- the crafter of arch lyrics-- is really what is missing from the film.Cate Blanchett:The most alluring sequence is the long Fellini-inspired London ""trip"". Even though a lot of Dylan lore is poured into this sequence it feels so self-consciously artsy that we wonder just what Haynes' real intentions are. This sequence, as so much of the film, attempts to let us know how all of the Dylan-mania (the positive and negative) felt from the inside of Dylan's head but just ends up feeling like a generic bad trip---complete with Alice in Wonderland references. Its funny as pomo pastiche but redundant as the film Don't Look Back captures the look and feel of this whole period (including run-ins with nasty and brutish reporters who seemed only interested in deflating the pop stars self-sustaining mythos) so well already. Granted, Blanchett is riveting to watch and its interesting to see this mercurial ""Dylan"" haunted and ultimately repulsed by his doppelganger: the equally mercurial ""Edie Sedgewick"" who shows him what he fears most, himself.Heath Ledger:Ledger looks like he's channeling Steve McQueen and Charlotte Gainsborough looks she is channeling Ali McGraw. Very little, if any, of Dylan in this particular scenario. Basically this thread is a generic break-up film. Haynes seems more interested in getting the period interiors perfect (so maybe somewhere inside his own artistic wonderland he does believe in historical accuracy)than in exploring Dylan the homemaker and breaker.Christian Bale:This is a Dylan lookin' for sincerity (a quality the reporter in London said he didn't have) and authenticity within folk and then within the pages of a bible. Haynes seems more interested in getting the 1960's and 1970's fashions correct than seeing what this period meant to Dylan creatively.Eleven year old front porch bluesman:The funniest of the Dylan's but the joke wears pretty thin pretty quick as you can't understand most of what the kid is sayin'.Richard Gere:The rock star film formula is an easy one to identify (even if the rock stars themselves remain elusive). Every rock film deals with a figure who spends the first half of his life searching for fame and the second half (if he makes it that far) despising it. This sequence reproduces Dylan at his most removed from the ""scene"" but what it misses is that these reclusive periods ( as this is really a conflation of two periods: the Basement Tapes period--1968-- and the Rolling Thunder Revue period--1974) were also Dylan at his most creative. If Dylan's rock mystique was increased by each role change (or each disappearance) then the arrival of punk avatar and rock deflater David Bowie on the scene in 1972 stole a lot of Dylan's thunder. (Not too surprisingly Haynes other major rock project -- The Velvet Goldmine-- is about the glam scene).A Series of Dreams:The Rimbaud Dylan is the most appealing because this one is the most artfully self-aware and so speaks the most truths about fame, art, and why people feel the need to craft and persecute heroes (but Dylan should have played this one himself as its closest to his current incarnation).These visions of Dylan are really also visions of the sixties. The chaos and confusion of one was mirrored in the chaos and confusion of the other and neither,according to Haynes' film, amounted to much. But this point has been made. In her own pomo chronicle of the sixties, The White Album, Joan Didion made the now infamous claim ""disorder was its own point.""

1140529,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0013D8L7C,Ed Uyeshima,"[4, 6]","I wish I was better prepared to accept the sheer audacity of Todd Haynes' wildly imagined take on Bob Dylan's life and legend because this 2007 film requires a certain mindset to accept a fragmented story thread that tethers together six disparate evocations of his persona. The conceit is that none of the personalities look remotely like him or have his name, which I believe is Haynes' main point, that Dylan is an enigmatic figure open to anyone's interpretation of who they think he is. Part of the frustration in watching the film is realizing that we don't know that much more about Dylan by the end. Most of the references to his checkered career in the screenplay co-written by Haynes and Oren Moverman will likely go past most viewers, even though many of the lines are direct quotes from Dylan. That's the most significant flaw of the approach taken here, that we are familiar enough with his life to make sense of the story being told.At the outset, we see Dylan as a black eleven-year-old who hops boxcars, writes folk songs as if he was living during the Great Depression, and goes by the name Woody Guthrie after his hero. Luckily, the precocious Marcus Carl Franklin is terrifically winning in the part. The second incarnation is Jack Rollins, a young 1960's-era folk singer with a political conscience played compellingly by Christian Bale. Julianne Moore, the star of Haynes' 2002 Douglas Sirk tribute,Far from Heaven, shows up in documentary-like footage being interviewed as a Joan Baez doppelganger. Bale also shows up later as Pastor John singing gospel songs reflecting Dylan's born-again conversion in 1979. With sometimes merciless bravado, Heath Ledger plays Robbie Clark, a Method-style Hollywood actor whose most acclaimed performance is of Rollins in a biopic. He gets married to a French girl, played affectingly by Charlotte Gainsborough, whom he eventually alienates with his obsessive, chauvinistic behavior.The most talked-about Dylan persona is embodied by Cate Blanchett, physically transformed into Jude Quinn, the male singer who achieves the pinnacle of his success in the mid-1960's only to face harsh criticism for going electric with his music. Looking more like a morosely arrogant k.d. lang, the actress gives a convincingly unapologetic performance as the drug-addicted musician whose media sound-bites were becoming a cynical series of non-sequiturs meant to make fools of the press. In the film's weakest passages, a rather somnambulant Richard Gere plays the latter-day Dylan as Billy the Kid in a surreal, San Peckinpah-influenced world set in the tense western town of Riddle. British actor Ben Whishaw rounds out the Dylan parade in a few faux-interviews as Arthur Rimbaud, a young rebel named after the tortured poet. To emphasize the differences among the Dylan interpretations, Haynes uses different film stock and narrative styles to tell the stories and then further convolutes matters by scrambling the disjointed fragments into a nearly random collage. Dylan's music is used throughout, sometimes as background, other times by contemporary performers lip-synched by the actors. His voice is an almost ghostly presence until he finally shows up playing his harmonica in 1960's-era documentary footage at the end.Part of me is genuinely impressed with Haynes' experimental-feeling narrative and how his film is imbued with an adventurous spirit that doesn't hold much concern for an audience's sensibilities. That's also the rub since it's difficult to have a feeling for an admittedly mysterious subject when the portrait is made up of six shards of a broken mirror. The two-disc 2008 DVD set provides plenty of extras starting with Haynes' rather elliptical commentary track. Also on Disc One are four text pieces under ""Intro to Film"", one describing the film's six principal characters as facets of Dylan. Disc Two contains six shorts featuring each of the characters replicating the famous card-dropping in Dylan's ""Subterranean Homesick Blues"" video. There are also two deleted scenes, four alternative/extended scenes, and an outtakes reel, the total of which runs about a half-hour. Audition tapes of Franklin and Whishaw and a tribute to Ledger are also included, as well as footage from the New York premiere and a twenty-minute featurette on the making of the soundtrack. The centerpiece of the second disc is ""A Conversation with Todd Haynes"", a portrait of the filmmaker running about 45 minutes that has Haynes talking about the genesis of the film and how it was made. More Dylan-specific text pieces and two theatrical trailers round out the extras.",3,Flawed But Periodically Compelling Collage of Dylan Makes for a Murky Character Study,1210636800,"05 13,

What I liked about this film, in addition to it being a movie that required me to engage my brain, is that the different aspects of Dylan's personality are presented as separate personas -- the ""parts"" of the personality get their own screen time.

1140532,A2BPDFR58H9575,B0013D8L7C,Galina,"[2, 2]","I am a fan of Bob Dylan's talent. I admire him as a singer-songwriter, musician who plays several instruments, and especially as a poet. I understand very well that Dylan is not Luciano Pavarotti, Robert Plant, Freddie Mercury or Ian Gillan but his rough, nasal and far from perfect singing voice speaks to me clearly. For five decades he's been a major figure in popular music and the number of his admirers has only increases as time goes by. It is not surprising that the figure of such complexity, influence and enigma would attract journalists, writers, and film directors who would try to understand and explain phenomenon of Bob Dylan. When I learned about Todd Haynes' films about Bob Dylan where different aspects of his personality during different times of his life, represented by the different performers, I became a little suspicious. The whole idea sounded a bit pretentious even if I respected what Hayens was trying to achieve. Sadly, his approach did not work for me.The movie is all over the place and it jumps from past to present and around the world with the grace and elegance of a behemoth. 6 actors of different ages, genders and races play the different Bob Dylan's personalities. I have no problems with many actors playing one person but the problem is - Hayens in his latest film is not Federico Fellini or Luis Bunuel who had made a movie with two actresses playing one character. Bunuel's last film was funny, mysterious, and interesting because Bunuel did not make a big deal of it, and because of his incomparable sense of humor. Having six actors playing one character makes the movie crowded, claustrophobic, and over-complicated with no particular reason and with ""no direction home"". Besides, of six actors, not all are equally good and it is not perhaps even their fault. Try to create depth of the character, for instance, in Richard Gere's part as a Billy the Kid outlaw figure - I could not help laughing out loud every time Gere was on screen and I love the actor dearly. One of the ominous signs for me that the movie is bad is an urge to laugh in the wrong places. Or take another Dylan's incarnation by the name Arthur Rimbaud - you either know who Arthur Rimbaud was and you laugh at the parallel Haynes tries to draw here or you don't, and it would make no sense to you why the French poet-Rebel of 19th Century was brought to life to enlighten us with the pieces of wisdom like: ""I accept chaos. I don't know whether it accepts me ""or ""Y'know, it's nature's will. And I'm against nature. I'm not cool with nature"" among others.I understand that ""I am not there"" was the loving tribute and the attempt to understand one of the most complex, enigmatic, controversial, and influential figure in the modern culture but quoting Dylan himself,""You may call me Terry, you may call me Timmy, You may call me Bobby, you may call me Zimmy, You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray, You may call me anything but no matter what you say... "", Mr. Haynes, sorry, but it did not work as the whole.You should have made the movie with one Bob Dylan - like figure and it should have been Cate Blanchett. She is way above all five male performers combined together, and her Jude Quinn simply blew away all other personalities from the screen. If ever the dis joined overwrought overcrowded incoherent self-indulgent and confusing with no redeeming cause movie did reach a high point, it was with Blanchett on screen. She keeps proving with her every role that she is truly one of the best (for me THE best actress of her generation - courageous, always ready to take on the challenge, convincing, compelling, beautiful talented Cate Blanchett.2/5 - all points go to Cate Blanchett",2,"""You may call me anything but no matter what you say...

1140533,A3QAQUUPFIARWB,B0013D8L7C,"Gord Wilson ""alivingdog.com""","[4, 6]","If you sit through this interminable film school experiment, you'll find something good about it at the end. If you sit through this review, you'll find what's good about the film. Now you'll just find what's wrong with it. Let me count the ways. Yes, Cate Blanchett could be Dylan's body double, and I could watch her all the way through the film, but some of the other personae seem complete blanks playing cardboard cutouts.One reason is that the film, despite appearances, has no period sense. You hear songs from 1983 while watching supposed '60s TVs. This assumes the audience has no sense of Dylan's music, but that undercuts the premise of the film, which assumes that it does. Straight up, this film could not be made without T. Bone Burnett, the one director who seems to have a sense of pacing this sort of film. But he's among those absent. It's got ""Sam Shephard"" all over it, but he's not among those in attendance. You'd have to have watched a lot of actual Dylan films, like Renaldo and Clara, and footage, like Don't Look Back, to get any sense of this film at all, and most of its accidental audience likely has not.Like the Bob Dylan Thirtieth Anniversary Special, a lot of the players seem stuck in the '60s. The exceptions in that TV special and subsequent album were Neil Young and Lou Reed. This film includes a lot of later Dylan music, but seems to suggest that the electric songs, for instance, somehow belonged to his pre-electric period (there is a parody of the Montery Pop Festival scene in which Dylan goes ""electric""). Viewers will likely be amazed to hear what are universally ranked among his best songs, ""Blind Willie McTell"" and ""Pressing On"", but they will be more surprised to find that these songs date from a period they think they despise, the ""born again"" era when Dylan was actually incredibly creative, as shown on The Bootleg Series, Vol. One-Three. Those stuck in the 'sixties, however, dismiss these songs out of hand, and without having heard them, knowing that Dylan must share their own prejudices, and therefore that nothing good can come of this musical relapse. That said, there is a parody of the Vineyard, heavily handled, like so much else in the film, but which provides the opportunity for playing ""Pressing On"" from Saved.Those whose ideas about Dylan only came from this film would get some very wrong ones, with some very wrong emphases, and likely hate him without cause. I think Joan Baez comes off worst in the film, although her name is never used. The actress playing her says things Joan would never say, for one reason because the vocabulary is from the wrong era and the tone is all wrong, shown by watching extant footage of Baez with Dylan, readily available, or by reading her best-selling autobiography, Daybreak. I would suggest that the actress in question declined to do either.Then there's the worst persona in the film, the aging outlaw, which seems to be drawn from Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid and a line in ""Knocking on Heaven's Door"". If you want outlaw/ Southern/ Western/ drifter types, Dylan knew millions of them. Look at the Rolling Thunder Revue. The Band comes to mind, and there seems to be a brief parody of Rick Danko, Levon Helm, and Robbie Robertson, again likely drawn from one Band song. If I had to guess I'd say ""The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down"".What I really can't understand is the critics. I suppose they have to watch so much drivel that seeing something pretentious and arty is a form of release. But a ten second shot parodying the Beatles high during the filming of Help hardly contributes a tribute to Richard Lester. Late on, it slips into an Across the Universe sort of surrealistic rock video which would have made a good starting point. In the end a parody of a play of an interpretation of not generally known history has a slightly limited appeal.I said I'd get to the good part, and I am. It's the closing credits, with all the titles of great Dylan songs going by, some of which seem not even to be in the film. It's the Dylan part. You hear so many great songs in this film, it makes you want to go to Pandora and start streaming Dylan radio. If the actors want viewers to like Dylan as much as they do, that's what will do it. But there's so much Dylan available now. Read his autobiography, Chronicles. Listen to the Bootleg series. Watch Masked and Anonymous, in which Dylan may be playing someone else, as Jack Fate. At least it's Dylan. Or get the soundtrack from I'm Not There.

1140534,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0013D8L7C,Grady Harp,"[26, 33]","I'M NOT THERE is clearly not a movie for everyone.  The concept of the film is experimental, the execution of the 'documentary' is actually an amalgam of the aura and influence of one man in the music world instead of a linear history of a famous singer/poet, and the goal seems more to find the effect of Bob Dylan's chameleon persona on those people with whom he came into contact than it is to relate the story of a fascinating and important American artist.Writer (with Oren Moverman) and Director Todd Haynes ('Far from Heaven', 'Velvet Goldmine') has gathered images, memorabilia, fragments of interviews, and responses from acquaintances and from these he has pieced together a quilt-like panorama of the enigmatic, elusive, ever-changing Bob Dylan.  The result is not meant to be a precise history, but instead a 'feeling' for the man who so profoundly influenced American music in the 1960s.  Haynes selected several top actors to inhabit various aspects of Dylan's life and times.  The Narrator for this both black and white and color film is symbolist poet Arthur Rimbaud (Ben Winshaw) who through a series of comments opens the vignettes that reflect Dylan.  Eleven-year-old Marcus Carl Franklin radiates the energy of Woody Guthrie when he is suggesting the early formative influences of Dylan.  Christian Bale becomes 'Jack Rollins', among the closest of the actors to impersonate the performing Dylan. Heath Ledger embodies the love-life side of Dylan's character with the  Claire of Charlotte Gainsbourg while Cate Blanchett comes closest to showing us the inverted personality as Jude Quinn - the name assigned to the character who most resemble Dylan's appearance and talk and physical reactions to the public, the press, and the audience. And as an homage to Dylan's preoccupation with history, the final version of Dylan becomes Billy the Kid (Richard Gere) in the surreal town of Riddle.  Other important characters pass through this musical m&eacute;lange - Julianne Moore comments as Alice Fabian, a Joan Baez-type figure, Michelle Williams becomes Coco for a moment, and Bruce Greenwood has double roles suggesting influences from the height of Dylan's career to his old age.Throughout the film the music of Bob Dylan pervades the soundtrack, the tunes as important as the timely poetry of his lyrical  output.  The film is as strange as the man who inspired it, and Todd Haynes and his amazing cast of actors give us an impressive slice of our history as well as an appreciation of the aura of the strangely haunting Bob Dylan.  In extended featurettes on the CD the director and cast give wonderful insights both into the character of Dylan as well as the concept of creating this amazing film. For some, watching these introductions BEFORE watching the actual movie may enhance appreciation of this art piece.  Highly recommended - but the audience must understand this is not a routine movie!

While watching the film, I was confused, there was nothing interesting. While fans of the film might argue, you have to be open to the whole new way of directing a film, I must admit this film left me in a bad mood and feeling rather indolent.

The events that follow are drawn as much from Dylan's songs as from his actual biography.My Review:In short, `I'm Not There' is restless, brilliant, and so far up its own arse. It's that kind of film: abundantly engulfing with its self-ego centric demeanour, with the subject that's wholeheartedly likeable.It's all about Bobby; it's a personal elegy to him, and all albeit an allegory that tells parts of his life through the use of several actors who prove to be a well ensemble of players. It's not in order, it goes from best to worst parts of his life, and it has to be; fractionally chronological as you are meant to see his life through a mix of good and bad times.Each segment entwines with the rest, seeming almost unnoticeable. As if you almost wait to see two different Bobby's run past each other, like some corny way to go from one story to another.The Man Dylan, who is it we suspect is his true self? Cate Blanchett, Heath Ledger, Ben Whishaw, Charlotte Gainsbourg, etc all play a part in Dylan's mayhem lived lifestyle.  Heath Ledger playing the easily absolved actor who could have been bigger as apposed to the singer who was made. Heath is also the failed husband, and then there's Ben Whishaw's  Dylan who fathoms and tries to connect his life with the poet Rimbaud.Cate Blanchett's Dylan gives a depiction of his controversial years, where he seemed lost on what his direction of music would turn to. Blanchett is the one who most closely captures the familiar inner conflict and the more upstaged conflict that wasn't in public's eye.Verdict:Played by multi-talented actors, we are given a multi-faceted biopic of Bob Dylan in his prime.

Count me among those that don't get it. For me the film was way too confusing, not particularly well written and just ok acting though Kate Blanchett was very good in her portrayal of Bob. I am a big fan and admirer of Bob Dylan so was certainly looking forward to watching this movie. Boy what a let down it was to me!Reading some of the other reviews on ""I'm Not There"" helped a bit in understanding better what the film was about but did nothing to lessen the disappointment I felt at such a confusing and at times boring movie. Still I might give watching ""I'm Not There"" another chance sometime. Maybe I am missing something I did not get that first time I watched it. Maybe it was just the mood I was in at the time...but I doubt it. It just really isn't that good a movie.The only good thing about this movie is the music. That is why I am giving the film two stars instead of one, the music does help save ""I'm Not There"" to some degree.

The poetry and music of the man are the foundation of this film, but, ""I'm Not There,"" offers an architectural disaster built upon that base.  I'm a fan of black and white films, particularly of the fifties and sixties, genres which this attempts to mimic, so I was disappointed when scenes and characters bounced around more haphazardly than kids in the bubble room at Ikea.  Rather than go with the flow, I wanted to stop the DVD and do some research to make sense of the random personas and make some sense of chaos.  My mind set is different now than it was in decades past and I'm less impressed by free-interpretation without reason.  As a college student, I'd studied and written about the art of Bob Dylan, so his words and delivery are not unfamiliar.  I played his music on the guitar and hi-fi, in pre-iPod times.  I've been a fan for many years and have friends who were neighbors of Bob Dylan in Minnesota when he was Robert Allen Zimmerman.  I expected much from this film but basically received flashbacks of the music with allusions to times past.  I gave this film 3 stars for the following positive reasons:  1. Cate Blanchett as Jude Quinn, 2. Richie Havens in the opening scene, 3. Throw away lines that are actually Dylan's lyrics, 4. Remembering the time I had a conversation with Joan Baez at the University of Florida, and 5. The impetus to listen to Bob Dylan on my iPod, then read Allen Ginsberg.If you're a fan of Dylan, I recommend the film/DVD and expect that you too will find things to like even if you may not care for the assembly of this abstract interpretation of the artist as a young/er/est man.",3,"The muse of the music was the times.

Unfortunately the writer/director Todd Haynes, took them to heart and based the entire picture on the concept, and seems to have done so with relish.

Several big-name reviewers applauded the film with phrases like ""it brakes the mold"" and one described it as an ""incandescent rebus."" NOTE TO SELF: Avoid incandescent rebuses!I like Bob Dylan's music and I really wanted to know more about him. Forget it. This rebus starts with a black child named Woody Guthrie (not the real Woody Guthrie) who is supposed to be Bob Dylan, although throughout the movie, he's called Jack Rollins except, of course, when he's called Billy the Kid, (a.k.a. Mister B. and other aliases), Arthur Rimbaud (not the real Arthur Rimbaud), Jude Quinn, and Pastor John. I get that these personas all represent shades or phases of Dylan's life but they make for a disjointed and incoherent movie. There is no time line. There is no continuity. The movie jumps forward and back leaving the viewer wondering if she should even try to keep track of what's going on. Word to the wise: DON'T.To make matters even murkier, there is yet another character who is the actor who portrays Jack Rollins in an unseen movie and this character is included in the jumping about of the movie. I presume that this character represents a ""Meta-Dylan"" but for the love of Mike, give us some help! I soon threw up my hands and decided to just enjoy the music.This movie might be art, but it is not entertaining or enlightening.

1140549,A27KNXAROMSJ7A,B0013D8L7C,"Kelly L. Norman ""li'l rock & roller""","[1, 1]","There is something about ""I'm Not There"" that lets you know at once  it is more than a biopic. Yes, the main character changes from the exuberant, tall-tale telling  Woody(Marcus Carl Franklin); to  poet Arthur Rimbaud (Ben Wishaw), to entitled Jude Quinn (Cate Blanchett), to  movie star Robbie (Heath Ledger) to folk ""hero"" Jack Rollins (Christian Bale) to Billy the Kid (Richard Gere) and back and forth between them. This is an homage, as Todd Haynes reveals on the commmentator track, to many of  the different directors in the sixties and seventies. Fellini, Goddard, and Peckinpah are mentioned, but I see glimmers of Scorcese and Sergio Leone.The shuttle of characters  works incredibly smoothly, and the variety of film techniques also helps to delineate the six characters.Most of Jude's (Blanchett) story, a black and white Fellini tribute, consists of sparring.  Blanchett embues Jude with some of the ugliness Dylan is supposed to have shown to friends and fans during the time  his style deviated from straight protest.  A journalist acts like everyman, or perhaps even Jude's conscience, turning up even in the elevator, asking ""If you are not singing protest songs any more, does that mean you do not believe what you were singing?  And if so, what do you believe?"" Dali-esque photography, such as a tarantula crawling across the lens of the camera, continues the Fellini theme.Robbie's story is splashed with the pale colors and spare dialogue of a Jean-Luc Goddard film, and like Goddard, the story of Claire and Robbie (mirroring Dylan's first marriage, and the Vietname war) struggles with traditional expectations of women. I wonder if there isn't a bit of Martin Scorcese in this scene too, with the raw emotion between Robbie and Claire, the theme of redemption...Robbie being perhaps the Dylan that stands to lose the most.Gere plays ""Billy"", based on Dylan's fancy of himself as an outlaw.  A Peckinpah-ish vision of Western scenery in which Halloween costumed people pack up all their belongings and shuffle off to accomadate a 6 lane highway is featured. Someone dressed as a soldier in clown face sings a song for a girl who's committed suicide and lies in an open casket: ""Goin to Acapulco"" which to date, I think, is the most beautiful Dylan song I've heard. Now we're not watching Peckinpah, we're watching Leone, specifically, the prison scene inIl Buono Il Brutto Il Cattivowhen soldiers are forced to sing to cover up the noise of torture.Billy's function as far as the Bard is concerned is to keep him off the world stage for awhile, mimicking Dylan's hiatus in the late sixties.  The story picks up with Jack Rollins(Bale), now a pastor in an evangelical church.Christian Bale makes a valiant effort at portraying what I'm sure he or Haynes thinks an evangelical pastor is like. But it comes off as rather stiff. The film style, however, is spot on, recalling grainy seventies documentaries about ""the silent majority"", and ""the New Evangelicals"", at a time the US elected a President who talked openly about being ""born again"".  It also has the look and feel of Christian ""scare"" films of that era such asA Thief in the Night.The stories of Rimbaud (Wishaw), the poet; and of Woody (Franklin), ares as compelling and well done.I was confused about one thing.  The choice of Franklin, an eleven year old black kid, who never gets treated like a kid, and who never gets treated as blacks were in the segregated south, to symbolize the twenty-something b.s.-ing Dylan in his first years in New York, was brilliant.So why did Cate Blanchett have to dress like a boy?

It does seem perfectly sad that Ledger's character is so out of touch with his feelings that he ruins a perfectly good marriage, just as the tabloids hint happened in real life.  As usual, the children pay the price, especially if they are to be left with Sarah (Charlotte Gainsbourg, whose one-dimensional portrayal of the character makes me think that other scenes must have been left on the cutting room floor).  Other reviewers have praised the actresses in Todd Haynes' latest film, but for me none of them did the trick.  Cate Blanchett has been hailed as though she were the second coming of Jesus Christ, but after a few minutes of her in the Don't Look Back, Andy Warhol, Chelsea Hotel phase of Dylan's career I longed for the movie to be over.  It's set up so that she appears to be having a ""meet cute"" romance with the British journalist who's interviewing her--they despise each other on sight, but by the end he's the only one who really understands her snd she knows it.  Clever re-write of the Ballad of a Thin Man narrative, one in which the Thin Man suddenly understands more than the sneering singer of the song.And what happened to poor Michelle Williams, forced to strut around the old set of the Jack Paar Show in a slinky mirrored gown and a Joey Heatherton wig.  Is she supposed to be Edie Sedgwick?  Good God almighty, my cat could have played Edie Sedgwick better than Michelle Williams, and she's a great actress!  Well, Haynes has changed her name to ""Coco,"" and maybe she's supposed to be some sort of combination of Edie and Nico.David Cross as Allen Ginsberg scared me!  All of a sudden I saw that Amber Tamblyn must see in him, an apocalyptic, Jim Jones kind of messiah figure who's not afraid to be a clown at the same time.  Brrrr!All in all I can say, I watched this movie all the way through and I appreciate the fact that Todd Haynes made it.  He must be an enormously persuasive guy to have talked Dylan into it and secured the funding, etc., based on his counterintuitive reading of Dylan's nature.  It's all about the big letdown of the fans, the fans who loved Dylan's folk music and then went bonkers when he went rock at Newport, and then Cate Blanchett has to answer accusations of selling out, and maybe that wasn't interesting anought to base a whole movie on, because I was like, whatever Cate.",4,Six Characters in Search of an Author,1241308800,"05 3, 2009",2009,2452,"['Audacious', 'have', 'Bale', 'Ledger', 'same', 'film', 'thunder', 'was', 'stolen', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'movie', 'seem', 'perfectly', 'sad', 'Ledger', 'character', 'so', 'touch', 'feelings', 'perfectly', 'good', 'marriage', 'just', 'tabloids', 'hint', 'happened', 'real', 'life', 'usual', 'children', 'pay', 'price', 'especially', 'are', 'be', 'left', 'Sarah', 'Charlotte', 'Gainsbourg', 'one-dimensional', 'portrayal', 'character', 'think', 'other', 'scenes', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'praised', 'actresses', 'Todd', 'Haynes', 'latest', 'film', 'none', 'did', 'trick', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'been', 'hailed', 'were', 'second', 'coming', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'few', 'minutes', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Look', 'Back', 'Andy', 'Warhol', 'Chelsea', 'Hotel', 'phase', 'Dylan', 'career', 'longed', 'movie', 'be', 'set', 'up', 'be', 'having', 'meet', 'cute', 'romance', 'British', 'journalist', 'who', 'interviewing', 'despise', 'other', 'sight', 'end', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'really', 'snd', 'Clever', 're-write', 'Ballad', 'Thin', 'Man', 'narrative', 'one', 'Thin', 'Man', 'suddenly', 'more', 'sneering', 'singer', 'song.And', 'what', 'happened', 'poor', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'forced', 'strut', 'old', 'set', 'Jack', 'Paar', 'Show', 'slinky', 'mirrored', 'gown', 'Joey', 'Heatherton', 'wig', 'supposed', 'be', 'Edie', 'Sedgwick', 'Good', 'God', 'almighty', 'cat', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'Edie', 'Sedgwick', 'better', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'great', 'actress', 'Well', 'Haynes', 'changed', 'name', 'Coco', 'maybe', 'supposed', 'be', 'sort', 'combination', 'Edie', 'Nico.David', 'Cross', 'Allen', 'Ginsberg', 'scared', 'sudden', 'saw', 'Amber', 'Tamblyn', 'must', 'see', 'apocalyptic', 'Jim', 'Jones', 'kind', 'messiah', 'figure', 'who', 'not', 'afraid', 'be', 'clown', 'same', 'time', 'Brrrr', 'can', 'say', 'watched', 'movie', 'way', 'appreciate', 'fact', 'Todd', 'Haynes', 'made', 'must', 'be', 'enormously', 'persuasive', 'guy', 'have', 'talked', 'Dylan', 'secured', 'funding', 'etc.', 'based', 'counterintuitive', 'reading', 'Dylan', 'nature', 'big', 'letdown', 'fans', 'fans', 'who', 'loved', 'Dylan', 'folk', 'music', 'then', 'went', 'bonkers', 'when', 'went', 'rock', 'Newport', 'then', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'answer', 'accusations', 'selling', 'out', 'maybe', 'was', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'anought', 'base', 'whole', 'movie', 'was', 'Cate']",N/A

The non-linear story line, the changing of actors, all the surreal imagry, and the whole premise of the move will really polarize people. But for those willing to look past all of these aspects of the film, one will find an extremly unique and oddly moving film.The film is more or less not the typical music biography, its almost like an interpitation of the life of Bob Dylan, one of the most interesting and complicated music icon's ever known. For the the six actors, each one potray's a diffrent side of the eclectic singer. Marcus Carl Franklin potrays the singer during his childhood, who goes by the name of Woodie Guthrie, on the run from a juvinile center. Christian Bale plays Jack Rollins, who represents Dylan as the political folk singer turned born again Christian. Cate Blanchett potray's Dylan during the controversial 'electric years' as Jude Quinn. Heath Ledger represents Dylan's failed marriage life as fictional Hollywood actor Robbie Clark. Richard Gere plays an elderly version of Dylan as 'Billy the Kid' in a surreal Western town. And finally, Ben Whishaw potrays the final version of Dylan as a rebel teen and acts almost like the narrator of the whole film.For me, I think that the reason most people might have a problem with the film is that, yes they know all about the films premise and that these actors are diffrent versions of Bob Dylan but I think the way to look at the film is not like a strict biographical life on the singer but more like stories based on his life, that all these characters are based off him and use his many life stages to evoke a diffrent story. Cause that's what initially threw me off the first time I watched it cuase I was so intent on making it like a Bob Dylan biopic but when I watched it a second time and not think of it as a biopic, then I found myself truley appreciating what the film was potraying.Now all the performances in the film are great. It's really heartbreaking having to watch Ledger, considering his death is still so fresh in people's mind, and seeing him on film reminds us just how much he had to show us. But, this is my honest opinion, Cate Blanchett simply stole the entire movie. As Jude Quinn, she just has everything going for her and submerges herself into this role, with a sarcastic edge to her voice, a broken down walk, cocky attitude, and a fire inside her that just radiates from out of her. Seeing this actress in nearly all her films, I would have to argue that this is her best performance that she has ever delivered so far. This is one performence that SHOULD have won her an Oscar.So while this film may not be for everyone, for those film enthusiast looking for a unique movie experience, this is definantly a film one should watch.

I thinkit is an American Masterpiece in the European Surrealistic tradition(Andre Breton, Salvador Dali), which I can't recall any other Americansignificant films of this genre, although there may have been a few (Early, and some later, David Lynch(e. g.;""erasure head,"" ""Blue Velvet""), Andy Warhol and Maya Deren have some but they are avant guard which is more niche work, ""The Man Who Fell To Earth"" has a little).I can see traces of other films and books about Dylan everywhere in this film: Dylan: A Biography, by Bob Spitz and, in particular the great, Don't Look Back (several scenes in this are playfully adapted to ""I'm not There"") by Pennebaker. Also, the more current ""Chronicles Volume 1"" autobiography, and, to a much lesser extent,Scorsese's (stick to crime films Martin!), overhyped, mediocre- ""No Direction"" Home have some influence as well.That said, the problem I can see for some people is that this film doesn't follow the usual linear approach, with perhaps a major flashback thrown in, of American Films. Cate Blanchette, as is often the case, is great as the ""Don't Look  Back,"" 1965, Dylan. The others are good to ok, with Bales and Ledger good and Richard Gere, as usual, ok. Also, Marcus Carl Franklin,the young black imaginary Dylan, is very good (see Spitz's book's discussion about Dylan's promotional phantasy (living in boxcar, for example), self created, background). I think Julia Moore is a very good actress, but couldn't figure out why she was there. The woman who plays his wife, Sarah, is good, but gets lost in the film's phantasmagoria.The idea of having 4 actors playing different part of Dylan's life is good but can be confusing. I liked the fact that Tod Haynes, the director, tried to capture the times (1960-1980) and didn't try to put today into yesterday. One could write a long essay, I'm sure there are/will (be) several, on this film. As there are several college courseson Dylan.I like post 1980 America films generally for entertainment only: many are fun. But this approaches a great piece of film art. To really appreciate its many subtle nuances fully, looking at  ""Don't Look Back"" wouldhelp immeasurably. Also, as with many art films, it becomes more accessible the more you see it. It is not a biography in a strict sense,but, again, it is film that will stand up with the great works ofEuropean, and world, cinema.

It works OK in films like Fellini's 'Intervista' or Pennebaker's 'Don't Look Back' because the chronology of the jumbled events in those films are not episodic. ('Intervista' revolves around an interview of a famous director on the grounds of the very busy film studio lot, so the chaos is inherent in the production of the many different works in progress there, and 'Don't Look Back' revolves around the circus that is not only a musician's life on the road but apparently Dylan's life in general at that time). But with 'I'm Not There' the scope of the film is a career that has to date spanned 45 years!  Todd Haynes created an interesting and unique collection of biographical short stories, with each developmental phase of Dylan's life being played by a different actor.  This was a brilliant idea and it could have worked well.  But Mr. Haynes gorged himself on the vignettes, and then PUKED it all back up into a chaotic hodge-podge of snippets from the promised tales. The casual viewer will suffer confusion and headaches trying to watch this movie and I doubt seriously if any but the hardcore Dylan fan will have the patience to pick up the pieces, rinse off the slime, and reconstruct the tales.

Dylan is represented by six different personas, but none called ""Bob Dylan"". The adventures of an 11-year-old runaway calling himself Woody Guthrie (Marcus Carl Franklin) are inspired by the fictional biography Dylan used to tell. 19-year-old Arthur Rimbaud (Ben Winslow) answers questions abut his choices put to him by an inquisition. Jack Rollins (Christian Bale) is a politically active folk singer who later immerses himself in Christian evangelism. Robbie Clark (Heath Ledger) is an actor whose personal life resembles Dylan's marriage to Sara Dylan and relationship with Suze Rotolo. Jude Quinn (Cate Blanchett) is a popular folk singer who angers his fans by going electric and abandoning politics. Billy the Kid (Richard Gere) is an aging rancher fighting a highway project in a dying frontier town.The segments about each of these six characters are shot on different film stocks, some color, some black-and-white, and interwoven in a semi-sensical fashion. Jude Quinn and Jack Rollins come the closest to literal representations of Dylan's life. You may recognize some other real-life characters in a folksinger named Alice Fabian (Julianne Moore), who resembles Joan Baez, and trendy socialite Coco (Michelle Williams), who resembles Edie Sedgwick. The Billy the Kid story is entirely fanciful and unfortunately tedious. He's a 19th century rancher fighting a 6-lane highway? Instead of embracing change, as many of Dylan's personas did, Billy resists it. But he does so in the most mind-numbing way possible. That segment would have been better left out or completely reconceived.Cate Blanchett has been praised for her portrayal of Jude Quinn, or Bob Dylan 1965-1966. There is a lot to like about this segment, not the least of which is that it has a sense of humor. It's also the most coherent, and the sometimes surreal black-and-white photography is a pleasure. Cate Blanchett does an imitation of Dylan, not an interpretation of him, similar to the approach she took to Catherine Hepburn in ""The Aviator"" (2004). It's an enjoyable performance, and she accentuates a fragility that was present in Dylan but which may have gone unnoticed. I like Christian Bale's passion as the Dylan that embraces causes, while the Blanchett and Clark personas are indifferent to them, but he has too little screen time. ""I'm Not There"" is more an exploration of identity and persona than of Bob Dylan himself. I suppose there is no better subject for such an undertaking than a man who changed his image many times.

1140563,A1URVCR4OMLG0O,B0013D8L7C,N. Chevalier,"[3, 5]","Well, the soundtrack is impeccable.  Even the cover versions. That's one certainty.OK, now here's the problem:In order to understand anything of this movie, you have to be a pretty knowledgeable Bob Dylan fan.  You have to catch the myriad references, some subtle (eg Richard Gere's ""Dylan"" meets ""a young child beside a dead pony,"" and lives in a town populated with characters from the Basement Tapes songs; the spider image that seems to have puzzled some reviewers here is, of course, a visual nod to Dylan's book, ""Tarantula""), some not--but mostly you have to have at least read Robert Shelton's ""No Direction Home,"" seen DA Pennebaker's ""Don't Look Back,"" and perhaps listened to every Dylan album between 1962 and 1980 (and the Bootleg Series CDs) in order to understand anything of what's going on.  However, anyone with that level of commitment to and understanding of Dylan himself is going to find it hard to assess the film as a film, since he or she will be too busy spotting references and revisiting familiar songs to view this film as an ""outsider"".At least, that was my experience watching this film.  I enjoyed it as a Dylan fan, and I enjoyed it as film to the extent that I was impressed with Cate Blanchett's transformation into the 1965/66 ""Pennebaker"" Dylan (this segment of the film reproduces bits of ""Don't Look Back"" and ""Eat the Document,"" with a weird Fellini-esque party sequence thrown in for good measure), Marcus Carl Franklin's wry treatment of the ""hobo"" Dylan (one of the best lines in the whole film is Franklin being told to ""sing his own time,"" and not bother pretending to be someone from the 1930s)--an astonishing piece of acting from a 13-year-old, and the sometimes-clever, artsy, post-modern vibe of the whole thing.  But I was equally puzzled by some of the film's choices.  Why, for example, is Heath Ledger's ""Dylan"" a washed-up movie actor, who once portrayed a film version of Christian Bale's ""Dylan""?  Ledger is supposed to be the early-1970s Dylan, he of the failed marriage, but the real Dylan transformed his suffering into the masterpiece of ""Blood on the Tracks,"" while Ledger's character just simply wallows in self-pity and misogyny, and becomes tiresome after about 10 minutes.  Why, for example, is Richard Gere portraying Billy the Kid, caught in a goofy showdown with an aged ""Pat Garrett""?  And are those musicians in that segment supposed to be The Band?  Basically, it comes down to this: when the ""Dylans"" in the film are representing skewed versions of their real counterparts (Blanchett, Bale, Franklin) the film works pretty well; when they veer off into oddball territory, only tangentially related to their supposed subject (Gere, Ledger), the film falls apart completely.Ultimately, I had to ask myself after it was over: if I were just an average moviegoer, would I be moved by any of this?  Probably not.  The movie is just too in love with its own cleverness, and too interested in appealing to Dylan fans, to break out of its own bubble and invite non-initiates in.Strangely enough, that is exactly the opposite experience from listening to Dylan himself.  Like Haynes' film, Dylan's work is complex, sometimes confusing, and even daunting.  It never offers its meanings easily.  And yet, every Dylan song is approachable and enjoyable on some level, and Dylan always invites his listeners to explore his work, to revel in the wordplay, or just to watch the creative process unfold.  Dylan the man may be reclusive and hard to find, but Dylan's songs aren't.  One is rewarded by repeated listenings of Dylan's songs; I'm not sure one can say the same of repeated viewings of ""I'm Not There.""",3,Who Is This Movie For?,1213142400,"06 11, 2008",2008,3669,"['Well', 'soundtrack', 'impeccable', 'Even', 'cover', 'versions', 'one', 'certainty.OK', 'now', 'here', 'problem', 'order', 'understand', 'anything', 'movie', 'have', 'be', 'pretty', 'knowledgeable', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'fan', 'have', 'catch', 'myriad', 'references', 'subtle', 'eg', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'Dylan', 'young', 'child', 'dead', 'pony', 'town', 'populated', 'characters', 'Basement', 'Tapes', 'songs', 'spider', 'image', 'have', 'puzzled', 'reviewers', 'here', 'course', 'visual', 'nod', 'Dylan', 'book', 'Tarantula', 'not', 'mostly', 'have', 'have', 'least', 'read', 'Robert', 'Shelton', 'No', 'Direction', 'Home', 'seen', 'DA', 'Pennebaker', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Look', 'Back', 'perhaps', 'listened', 'Dylan', 'album', '1962', '1980', 'Bootleg', 'Series', 'CDs', 'order', 'understand', 'anything', 'what', 'going', 'However', 'anyone', 'level', 'commitment', 'understanding', 'Dylan', 'going', 'find', 'hard', 'assess', 'film', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'too', 'busy', 'spotting', 'references', 'revisiting', 'familiar', 'songs', 'view', 'film', 'outsider', '.At', 'least', 'was', 'experience', 'watching', 'film', 'enjoyed', 'Dylan', 'fan', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'extent', 'was', 'impressed', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'transformation', '1965/66', 'Pennebaker', 'Dylan', 'segment', 'film', 'bits', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Look', 'Back', 'Eat', 'Document', 'weird', 'Fellini-esque', 'party', 'sequence', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure', 'Marcus', 'Carl', 'Franklin', 'wry', 'treatment', 'hobo', 'Dylan', 'one', 'best', 'lines', 'whole', 'film', 'Franklin', 'being', 'told', 'sing', 'own', 'time', 'not', 'bother', 'pretending', 'be', 'someone', '1930s', 'astonishing', 'piece', 'acting', '13-year-old', 'sometimes-clever', 'artsy', 'post-modern', 'vibe', 'whole', 'thing', 'was', 'equally', 'puzzled', 'film', 'choices', 'Why', 'example', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Dylan', 'washed-up', 'movie', 'actor', 'who', 'once', 'portrayed', 'film', 'version', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'Dylan', 'Ledger', 'supposed', 'be', 'early-1970s', 'Dylan', 'failed', 'marriage', 'real', 'Dylan', 'transformed', 'suffering', 'masterpiece', 'Blood', 'Tracks', 'Ledger', 'character', 'just', 'simply', 'self-pity', 'misogyny', 'tiresome', '10', 'minutes', 'Why', 'example', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'portraying', 'Billy', 'Kid', 'caught', 'goofy', 'showdown', 'aged', 'Pat', 'Garrett', 'are', 'musicians', 'segment', 'supposed', 'be', 'Band', 'Basically', 'down', 'when', 'Dylans', 'film', 'are', 'representing', 'skewed', 'versions', 'real', 'counterparts', 'Blanchett', 'Bale', 'Franklin', 'film', 'pretty', 'well', 'when', 'veer', 'oddball', 'territory', 'only', 'tangentially', 'related', 'supposed', 'subject', 'Gere', 'Ledger', 'film', 'apart', 'completely.Ultimately', 'had', 'ask', 'was', 'were', 'just', 'average', 'moviegoer', 'would', 'be', 'moved', 'Probably', 'not', 'movie', 'just', 'too', 'love', 'own', 'cleverness', 'too', 'interested', 'appealing', 'Dylan', 'fans', 'break', 'own', 'bubble', 'invite', 'non-initiates', 'in.Strangely', 'enough', 'exactly', 'opposite', 'experience', 'listening', 'Dylan', 'Haynes', 'film', 'Dylan', 'work', 'complex', 'sometimes', 'confusing', 'even', 'daunting', 'never', 'meanings', 'easily', 'yet', 'Dylan', 'song', 'approachable', 'enjoyable', 'level', 'Dylan', 'always', 'listeners', 'explore', 'work', 'revel', 'wordplay', 'just', 'watch', 'creative', 'process', 'unfold', 'Dylan', 'man', 'may', 'be', 'reclusive', 'hard', 'find', 'Dylan', 'songs', 'are', ""n't"", 'One', 'rewarded', 'repeated', 'listenings', 'Dylan', 'songs', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'one', 'can', 'say', 'same', 'repeated', 'viewings', ""'m"", 'Not']",N/A

Romero's Diary of the Dead, another movie you should miss).Now, I've had my fair share of post-modernism by now. What college student studying during the past 20 years hasn't? But this was not post-modern, or chic, or creative in any way (besides Blanchett, more on that in a minute); nay, it was merely one non-sequitur after another.Random vignettes with little to no purpose are strung together to form a movie that feels about as long as an extended version of Lord of the Rings. The point is to portray Bob Dylan's life. Or to speculate how giraffes were involved. Or something like that. You never know, because the movie feels like a giant inside joke.Several actors portray what they think Dylan at a particular point in his life, such as Richard Gere, who plays Dylan when he was J.D. Salinger, living in the woods and attending town hall meetings. None of these are compelling, and only one is convincing, that being Cate Blanchett's performance as a jaded Bob Dylan being interviewed by the Beeb. She does a great job playing a man, and her performance was the only really memorable moment in the show: at one point, she meets up with Ginsberg and they stand under a crucified Jesus. Cate Dylan yells, ""I liked your older stuff more!"", or something to that effect. It's the only line I vaguely remember, because the rest of the dialog sounded like whining.The movie would have been better served but cutting out everything but Cate, including the late Heath Ledger and the black kid who was apparently a blues singer but also was Bob Dylan when he was hopping trains and putting his guitar in the floorboards. The movie would have been 30 minutes long, and probably would have been a masterpiece of modern short film making.Now, I realize I don't ""get it"".

Once you accept the premise of Dylan's celebrity selves as multifaceted we can sit back and enjoy their performances and the sheer visual pleasures of the cinematography. You are expected, of course, to be Dylan-honed, like a trained bloodhound, to sniff the connexions as  the six selves slip in and out of view, they never intersect or connect. An outward bound boy, an aspiring folkie, a self-protective rocker, a failing  husband, a bemused cowboy, a confessorial poet - the identities remain discreet with little self-disclosure about Dylan. In this mutual oblivion, they track on, cohered by a terrific soundtrack. References abound for the Dylan academic, not least its ramshackle length like a never-ending tour a la 'Renaldo and Clara'. The Pennebaker archives have schooled the most resonant simulation for Blanchett's stunning act, fidgetting with amphetamined lips in the rear of the Rolls in London. And Antonioni's 60s touchstone,'Blow Up' is conjured in the 'Taratula' haunted cocktail party of swingers. Both Blanchett and the wisearse Marcus Franklin are so 'in' their roles(his duet on the verandah with Richie Havens is a highlight) as to heighten the two-dimensionality of the other Dylans. Gere's 'Alias' wandering into bucolic Woodstock is a sweet if drawn out imaginative touch which gives vent to a memorable version of, 'Going To Acupulco'. I loved the cute references to 'Hard Days Night' and Bob and Ginsberg mocking a crucifixion. For depth or dirt we'd have to hear from wives and lovers,Kids and friends - the  Koerners, the van Ronks, the Neils, the Dickinsons: highly unlikely now. Other than that we have Bob's own mythologizing in 'Chronicles' and more importantly for our own transformation,in an unrivalled body of music.

Bloom,"[1, 6]",the movie was a good idea i guess-- its an interesting story-- this kid from hibbing rising to the top-which is really the bottom as he says in one of his brilliant songs-- to be at the top of a culture where the cult of celebrity rules over all and corrupts its artists as well as the people who buy into it-- its just too bad that almost aLL OF THE ACTORS WHO PORTRAY HIM -- HIS O SO VARIED PERsonas--- in his continual quest to stay ahead of the all consuming mass culture who would eat him alive and turn him into a static product-- its too bad they all over act or do these mostly embarassing imitations of the great enigmatic magician genius- the bright spots are the real footage of the era's depicted-and dylan singing his own songs--which thankfully he does quite a bit here- its just great to hear him in 5.1 surround sound !!!! so we have to suffer all these so called actors mucking up the works in every other scene-eroding the brilliance of not so much the man himself - but the very zeitgeist he seems to channel so effortlessly == its not the singer but the songs !! and the times they defined--- getting down his quirky mannerisms is the least of it all--but the movie is ultimately worth it-- because hidden in this quirky hodgepodge-- is the story of the struggle of any great artist-- esp one who has risen to the top of a game --one  he ultimately sees thru and knows is a trap -- living up to others expectations--having to compromise ones self-- haVING TO DEAL W ALL THE SCOUNDRELS AND MONEY HUNGRY  BLOOD SUCKERS who attach themselves to the next big thing like viperous leeches that can suck the life out of the best of them-- just look at lets say judy garland-- marilyn monroe elvis etc--  talented people who's very lives were laid waste by the great devouring soul destroying machinery of our sick culture and its  cult of celebrity obsessions-- and dylan has quite succeeded of course--staying ahead -or is it behind ? of the gnawing teeth and preying eyes ---he knows how to retreat aND  preserve his talent--- so the movie has its interests  re these themes--- and some other real talent in this movie-- is in the short first scene w richie havens--- his voice is a tonic-- and his persona and talent about as real and true as they come---he adds a gravitas to the enterprise that is sorely missed as the story proceeds-- and the cast of sub par actors threaten throughout to bring the whole thing down every time they appear or unfortunately have to sing--- dylan cant really sing in any conventional sense--same w his harp playing--- but therein lies his particular genius-how it all works beyond all imagining ! but putting up w less stellar talent imitating him - without the ringing spark of genius behind it-- well its just unbearable -- but luckily someone else in charge here thought so too apparently-- because after every misstep w others singing his songs-- we have him in all his masterful glory retrieving the whole thing every time--restoring the soundtrack to the heights only he can attain--- so a lot of this is really painful to watch--- the ginsburg character was well done tho -his agent was almost as good----the insights of how dylan would re invent himself and shed personas others would otherwise entrap him in--- all interesting-- and what makes it all really worthwhile- is to hear the final song ---dylan singing his own song-- like a rolling stone--- a song that is so amazing- so thrilling-- it gives me the warmest thrills just to hear the first notes of its crazy jaunty artistry- an anthem of the era it defines- a one of a kind song of a lifetime--- but every one of his tunes is a revelation to hear --when hes singing them-- and the songs here are all well chosen-- some fairly obscure ones you dont hear often--  thankfully addding another rewarding dimension to this often frustrating movie-skip thru the embarrassing scenes of others trying to capture the quixotic & uncapturable genius---and revel in and marvel at the rest !!!,3,actors almost ruin it-- but cant !!!,1210636800,"05 13, 2008",2008,3998,"['movie', 'was', 'good', 'idea', 'i', 'guess', 'interesting', 'story', 'kid', 'hibbing',

1140575,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0013D8L7C,Robert Moore,"[9, 12]","Before delving into the vices and virtues of this film, I have to pause to say how astonishing Cate Blanchett was in this film.  Though Todd Haynes famously used multiple actors to portray versions of Bob Dylan, Cate Blanchett's performance was hands down the most impressive of the bunch.  If you have seen DON'T LOOK NOW -- D.A. Pennebaker's documentary of Dylan on tour in 1975 -- or Scorsese's BOB DYLAN: NO DIRECTION HOME, which featured extensive excerpts of color footage that Pennebaker took but didn't use in that earlier film, Blanchett's performance is bone chillingly accurate.  The Dylan in those documentaries makes you nervous and ill at ease, just as Blanchett does.  What was especially impressive was how completely she nailed Dylan's voice.  An Australian woman in her late thirties would not be someone you would anticipate doing a dead on Dylan impersonation, but there you have it.  Often when men try to sound like women or women like men, they merely raise or lower the pitch of their voice.  Blanchett, who normally has a deep, rich voice, seems somehow to take her voice down very low, and then raise it up as if straining to speak as high as she does.  The result is very much like the Dylan from DON'T LOOK BACK, who strains to speak in a high pitch.  And if you've heard the soundtrack where someone in concert calls Dylan ""Judas"" you'll know that she seems to be channeling Dylan when she replies into the mike, ""I don't believe you.""Cate Blanchett is one of three great things in the movie.  The other is the music of Bob Dylan featured throughout.  One of the Beatles -- I forget which one -- upon being asked if the Beatles would be listened to in 500 years, replied that he thought only Bob Dylan from this generation would still be listened to at that time.  I think that is correct.  There is just a staggering amount of it, much of it on a level of creativity and brilliance that no one else can touch.  So any movie with lots of Dylan's music -- much of it performed by himself as background music, much of it in the form of covers -- is a better movie as a result.  The third great thing in the movie is the look of it.  I'm not sure he is capable of making a film that wasn't riveting to look at.  VELVET GOLDMINE and FAR FROM HEAVEN were both exquisite to look at, and I'M NOT THERE follows form.Unfortunately, there were long stretches of this very long movie that were unrelentingly dull.  Haynes tries to resolve the many contradictions in Dylan's persona by breaking these out and having various aspects played by different actors.  As mentioned, Cate Blanchett's Jude Quinn is a tremendous success in presenting the electric Dylan of the mid-sixties.  Heath Ledger's bad-family-man Dylan was a terrible failure (and it is very sad to see Ledger so horribly miscast in what would turn out to be one of his last roles).  Richard Gere's version of Dylan as Billy the Kid was also strange, never quite shifting over to the Dylan of the Basement Tapes, never quite shifting over into any version of Dylan.  I found it also strange that he was not asked to perform at all.  I don't know if Gere can sing, but I've read that he is a professional quality guitarist and played professionally before becoming an actor.  The other Dylan's were moderately successful.  The short version is that Cate Blanchett was extraordinary, Heath Ledger was wildly inappropriate, while the other Dylan's were average (though Christian Bale's version of Dylan in his Jesus phase was fascinating).If you know don't much about Dylan's career and life this could be a hard film to follow.  Some of it was based nearly word for word on real life interviews, especially some of Blanchett's scenes.  Some bits seem to have very little basis in Dylan's life, such as his marriage to Louise (perhaps the details were changed more there than elsewhere for legal reasons).  Dylan obviously never became a Christian minister, though he did go through a religious phase that he has never completely renounced.  A good deal of the content was supplied by myth.  For instance, when Dylan plugged in at the Newport Folk Festival (the New England Folk Festival in the film), he was greeted with far less anger than many have stated (and it is borne out by concert recordings).  Not all booed.  And Pete Seeger denies that he tried to cut an electrical cable with an ax (though he does say he tried to get the volume turned down).The film creates elaborate fantasies about Dylan's early life, but that at least is similar to lies Dylan told upon first going to New York, telling people he was an orphan and that he had spent time riding the rails.  Many of his closest friends where shocked when his parents turned up to hear him perform, just as they were astonished to learn that he was Jewish and from Minnesota.  One can understand the temptation to create a film breaking down the Dylan mythos.  Walt Whitman said of himself ""I embrace multitudes.""  This is certainly true of Dylan as well.  We can recognize the fragments of these myths by the various incarnations of his personal in this film, while still denying that the film always -- or even often -- does a good job of either ""getting it right"" or making much of a point when it does.So, do I recommend this movie?  To fans of Dylan, yes.  If you know enough to argue with it and know where you need to deny or resist it, it can be -- at times -- fascinating.  But if you are not terribly familiar with Dylan, check out Martin Scorsese's BOB DYLAN: NO DIRECTION HOME instead.  That film doesn't delve into all the myths, but does focus brilliantly on one:  Dylan's move from folk to electric music.  Because the music that Dylan produced on albums like HIGHWAY 61 REVISITED and BLONDE ON BLONDE changed the face of music -- just about every important musical performer of the time, from the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Who, Otis Redding, Sam Cooke, the Motown stable of writers, the Kinks, the Beach Boys, and just about anyone else you care to name, completely rethought their writing, and especially the lyrical content of their songs, in response to Dylan.  Every musician from the time of Dylan's electric turn has either been directly inspired by Dylan, or inspired by people upon whom Dylan was a major if not the major influence.  But one will not get much of that from this film.",3,Both fascinating and a tad dull at the same time,1214092800,"06 22, 2008",2008,6358,"['delving', 'vices', 'virtues', 'film', 'have', 'pause',

1140579,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0013D8L7C,Roland E. Zwick,"[4, 4]","In making a movie about the legendary musician/songwriter/poet/social activist Bob Dylan, filmmaker Todd Haynes could have hired a single actor to impersonate his subject and then related the key events of his life in standard chronological order.  But Haynes clearly had something deeper and more complex in mind when he envisioned this work.  The result, ""I'm Not There,"" is a boldly original movie that is part truth and part deliberate fiction, part straight-forward narrative and part pseudo-documentary, part stark realism and part surrealistic fantasy.  And while all of the elements don't work equally well together, the movie as a whole still provides a fascinating portrait of one of the key artists and musicians of the second half of the 20th Century.Haynes breaks one of the cardinal rules of biographical storytelling right off the bat by having no fewer than six actors - Cate Blanchett, Heath Ledger, Christian Bale, Richard Gere, Ben Whishaw and Marcus Carl Franklin - portray Dylan at various stages of his career and life. And, in an act of even greater audaciousness, he has assigned each of these roles a different fictitious name (and it isn`t because Haynes feared he might be sued for his efforts since Dylan himself okayed the movie).  Haynes, with the assistance of co-writer Oren Moverman, then arranges the various pieces into a time-shifting mosaic that allows us to see Dylan at all those discrete moments in his life virtually simultaneously.  Finally, he incorporates many of Dylan's songs on the soundtrack to serve as a sort of running commentary on both the character and the times in which he`s living.Haynes makes it clear that Dylan was as much a product of those times as he was a shaper of them.  The film shows us his early days as an idealistic young singer/songwriter (here named Woody after Dylan's boyhood hero and role model Woody Guthrie), who has just escaped from a juvenile detention facility and is now riding the boxcars, his guitar in hand, strumming out protest songs in defense of the underprivileged and working classes.  We then follow Dylan through the various stages of his life: first, as Jack (Bale), a rising young folk singer in Greenwich Village; then as Jude (Blanchett) an anti-establishment pop culture hero, singing and speaking out against social injustice and the Vietnam War; later (still as Jude), as a press-hounded ""celebrity"" often denounced as a ""sellout"" for adopting the very elitist lifestyle he'd earlier railed against in his works.  The roles assigned to Ledger and Gere provide even more radically oblique takes on the Dylan persona.  Ledger plays Robbie, a Hollywood actor who's portraying Jack (i.e. Dylan) in a film on his life, while Gere represents an aging version of Dylan, envisioned here as Billy the Kid, living in the wild west and taking on the legendary Pat Garrett in an effort to save a small town from being subsumed by an evil corporation (this is definitely the most ""out there"" of all the storylines in the film and, without a doubt, the least compelling and effective).Of the actors, Blanchett gets to play Dylan at what is probably the juiciest and most provocative period of his life (at least from a character standpoint), the time when he alienated many of his earliest fans by ""reinventing himself"" as it were - turning away from traditional folk music in favor of a much edgier rock'n'roll sound, and transforming his own image from that of a jeans-wearing man of the people to that of a sunglasses-sporting, Carnaby-clad - and now quite remarkably cynical - pop culture celebrity.  Blanchett`s vivid performance captures the tormenting self-doubt of a man caught between being a ""spokesman"" for a social movement and a simple human being trying to survive in the very world he's being called upon to denounce.  The movie raises the question of whether it is ever possible for an artist to remain a social iconoclast after he has attained the level of a cultural icon - with all the attendant compromise that comes with such a status.Next to Blanchett, Ledger gives what is probably the most fully-rounded performance in the film, fleshing out the domestic side of the public figure in his thoughtful portrayal of Dylan as husband and father.Haynes' eclecticism involves the mixing together of not only various time periods but of wildly varying filmmaking styles as well.  For instance, some of the stories are shot in black-and-white while others are done in color, just as he uses a traditional narrative technique in some sequences yet documentary-style reportage in others.The film does suffer from a number of serious, though nowhere near fatal, flaws.  As noted earlier, the Richard Gere section comes across as too arbitrary and tacked-on to feel fully a part of the rest of the film.  And the movie does run on a trifle longer than it needs to in order to make its point.  Moreover, the overly objectified style of the movie, impressive as it is, nevertheless, has the perhaps inevitable effect of distancing us so much from the subject matter that the heart, as opposed to the head, is never really fully engaged in what it is showing us.Still, for the sheer unadulterated love Haynes demonstrates for his medium and the insight the movie offers into a beloved cultural icon, ""I'm Not There"" is a work very much worth savoring, faults and all.",4,vivid and imaginative,1215907200,"07 13, 2008",2008,5362,"['making', 'movie', 'legendary',

Interesting but uninviting, cold, distant. There's a lot of good things to be said about Todd Haynes's 'I'm Not There' but there are even more bad things to be said as well. For an average film-goer who may be unfamiliar with Bob Dylan, 'I'm Not There' could be absolutely unbearable. For myself, having known a thing or two about Dylan (not neccessarily a fan) and being a fan of Haynes's previous films, I thought I'd get something out of this. I was wrong. I just wasn't ""there"".The film is NOT a bio-pic of Dylan. It's rather a bunch of collected scenes from different actors (and actress) ""personifying"" Dylan at different stages in his life. I get that much, and it sounds intriguing enough. However, there's is simply no structure to the film whatsoever, and for a running of over 2hrs, there has got to be at least some kind of order.I can admire the thought but perhaps it's just that - a good thought. As for the preformances, they're really great even though you may not know what's going on, the act(ress)ors keep you engaged. Though after awhile, it can become extremely tedious and irriating.Fans of Dylan might enjoy this a bit more than the average film-goer- the music is good, and in fact at times it feels like you're watching a music video, one very long music video. So if you're into that, then this is for you.Overall, this is a film that probably deserves a look. It's an intellectual art film that's nice to look at listen to, but as far as getting something out of it like some insight on Dylan himself or even just a good story, then you might want to look elsewhere.

It was on this second watching that I realized the true beauthy of this film.I'm Not There is a film about Bob Dylan as Apocalypse Now! is a film about Vietnam. Both films captured the truly surrealistic essence of their substance. The latter captured the surreal lunacy of the Vietnan War while the latter captured the surreal chameleon we know as Dod Dylan. The director was right on point in having different actors portray Dylan at the different phases of his life. THere is some poetic justice at having an Afro-American portray Dylan as a child. Both must have been and felt similarly dispossessed.  There is a similar appropriateness of having Kate Blanchet portray the 1966 Dylan. The ""real"" Dylan was certainly a waif-like shell of a person, exhausted and spent from years of demands from his fans of what they thought he was and what they thought he represented. Dylan was simply Dylan,unable to articulate the reasons behind his persona because he simply experienced and followed his muse, not asking the reasons why he was the mouthpiece for that muse.The movie also accurately portrayed the 60s in general, when the clash of cultures first manifested and reared its ugly head. Those were surrealistic times as well.It will take a number of years before the film receives wide acceptance and not be relegated to a cult film.",5,Simply Brilliant!,1306281600,"05 25, 2011",2011,1429,"['watched', 'movie', 'second', 'time', 'yesterday', 'occasion', 'Bob', 'Dylan', '70th', 'birthday', 'was', 'second', 'watching', 'realized', 'true', 'beauthy', 'film.I', ""'m"", 'Not', 'film', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'film', 'Vietnam', 'films', 'captured', 'truly', 'surrealistic', 'essence', 'substance', 'latter', 'captured', 'surreal', 'lunacy', 'Vietnan', 'War', 'latter', 'captured', 'surreal', 'chameleon', 'know', 'Dod', 'Dylan', 'director', 'was', 'right', 'point', 'having', 'different', 'actors', 'portray', 'Dylan', 'different', 'phases', 'life', 'poetic', 'justice', 'having', 'Afro-American', 'portray', 'Dylan', 'child', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'felt', 'similarly', 'dispossessed', 'similar', 'appropriateness', 'having', 'Kate', 'Blanchet', '1966', 'Dylan', 'real', 'Dylan', 'was', 'certainly', 'waif-like', 'shell', 'person', 'exhausted', 'spent', 'years', 'demands', 'fans', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'what', 'thought', 'represented', 'Dylan', 'was', 'simply', 'Dylan', 'unable', 'articulate', 'reasons', 'persona', 'simply', 'experienced', 'followed', 'muse', 'not', 'asking', 'reasons', 'why', 'was', 'mouthpiece', 'muse.The', 'movie', 'also', 'accurately', 'portrayed', '60s', 'general', 'when', 'clash', 'cultures', 'first', 'manifested', 'reared', 'ugly', 'head', 'were', 'surrealistic', 'times', 'well.It', 'will', 'take', 'number', 'years', 'film', 'wide', 'acceptance', 'not', 'be', 'relegated', 'cult', 'film']",N/A
1140590,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B0013D8L7C,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[8, 18]","I'm not sure what director Todd Haynes (""Far from Heaven"") is trying to accomplish with ""I'm Not There"", his new biography, of sorts, of Bob Dylan.Different actors each play Dylan, at different points in his life, or maybe they play different aspects of Dylan's persona. So, we have Cate Blanchett playing ""Jude Quinn"", Richard Gere playing ""Billy the Kidd"", Ben Whishaw as ""Arthur Rimbaud"",  Marcus Carl Franklin portraying ""Woody Guthrie"", Christian Bale as ""Jack Rollins"" and Heath Ledger playing ""Robbie Clark"". But if each of these actors is playing a different part of Bob Dylan's life, why do they all have different names? Why is Richard Gere's ""Billy the Kidd"" living in 1880s Missouri? Why is a young, black kid playing ""Woody Guthrie"". Why is one of the Dylan personas named after a famous poet?I get Haynes' idea of having different people playing different parts of the musician's life; Dylan has had many facets to his persona and his life. But naming each of these personas doesn't really make any sense.Cate Blanchett is really the only one who makes an effort to evoke what we know of Dylan. She both looks and acts like our image of the famous singer. Maybe that is Haynes point; we really know very little about the singer - songwriter. But if what he is presenting here is supposed to be factual, in any way, how does Gere's ""Billy the Kid"" fit into the picture?Christian Bale, one of the more interesting actors working in Hollywood today, plays his part of the puzzle that is Bob Dylan, largely through still photographs and concert performances relayed to us through clips in a VH1- style ""Where are they now?"" type of documentary. He almost never appears on screen long enough to give his character any life.The film also shifts back and forth between the various characters, shifting our attention back and forth between various times and stages in the subject's life. This isn't a bad thing, it just makes us pay more attention to everything, to keep up with the story. And when the story is lacking or meanders, these moments become glaringly obvious.But what is the story? It's hard to say. Haynes seems to be trying to create a poem of sorts, shifting back and forth between the various elements, painting little dabs of something here and little dabs of something there. This is an interesting idea, but we never get a fully realized idea of what Haynes is trying to say or depict. So all of the shifting back and forth merely becomes a tiring exercise in trying to keep up with the director. When you finally realize all of this work was for naught, you will probably feel let down.As let down as I was, because I felt like I had learned nothing new about the icon's life.I am all for a filmmaker trying to paint a portrait of a difficult to understand artist, but we are never even sure if that is Haynes' thesis about Dylan. Is he difficult to understand? Is that why he chooses to show little snippets here and there, using different actors to portray different people who are supposed to be Dylan? I'm not sure. Generally, if a film is attempting to portray a difficult to understand person or theme and goes to these lengths to create this portrayal, the director should at least have a clear vision of what he is trying to accomplish I don't feel Haynes has this. He seems to be trying to work out what he wants to say as the film rolls.
