It was very eighties cartooning but I don't care. I loved every minute. In fact as a kid it came on at 6 in the morning and I would get up to watch it. Once I tured on the stereo to hear the show in surround sound and it was a little too loud. Well, my old man woke up and can out to the living room in the ""buck"" and turned it off. Walked back to his bedroom without saying a word. I knew I was in a ton of crud but I didn't care.

It was an early Christmas gift, and I didn't expect this to come out until early January!At any rate, I checked out some episodes and I can't complain about the quality -- well done.Also, don't freak out when you look at the playing surface of the discs of Volume 2 (they have a purplish appearance as opposed to the shiny, full color spectrum appearance). It must be some copy-proof thing. But they will do just fine in all DVD players (including my Arcam DVD player).I'm glad we now have all 65 episodes of this 80s classic!",5,SilverHawks Now Complete,1328659200,"02 8, 2012",2012,643,"['should', 'first', 'say', 'how', 'rapidly', 'received', 'long-delayed', 'second', 'half', '80s', 'animated', 'series', 'Silverhawks', 'was', 'early', 'Christmas', 'gift', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'come', 'out', 'early', 'January', 'rate', 'checked', 'out', 'episodes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'complain', 'quality', 'well', 'done.Also', 'do', ""n't"", 'freak', 'out', 'when', 'look', 'playing', 'surface', 'discs', 'Volume', '2', 'have', 'purplish', 'appearance', 'opposed', 'shiny', 'full', 'color', 'spectrum', 'appearance', 'must', 'be', 'copy-proof', 'thing', 'will', 'do', 'just', 'fine', 'DVD', 'players', 'including', 'Arcam', 'DVD', 'player', ""'m"", 'glad', 'now', 'have', '65', 'episodes', '80s', 'classic']","SilverHawks: Season 1, Vol. 2"

I read another review that said not to freak out over the backside of the DVD because it's purplish in color and not the standard clear color.  This person believes that it is a copy coding thing or something but in reality the reason that it is purplish is because it is a DVD-R.  Pretty much all DVD-R's have this same color on the backside of the DVD.  I'm not saying that the DVD's are poor in quality or anything but just know that they are not professionally produced DVD's.  Also, if u look at the descriptions very carefully there is a note about DVD-R's as well as letting u know that the region is all regions which also usually means DVD-R's.  Your professional DVD's usually are like region 1 for the US and then there's region 2 and 4, etc.  Just thought I would give u a heads up about this DVD set.  I will still probably purchase it because it will be nice to finally have all of the episodes of this fantastic show.
