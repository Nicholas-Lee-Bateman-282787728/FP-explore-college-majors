That's not a bad thing, because if he played Cromwell as he really was, no one could stand this movie. Harris, an Irish man, presents a heroic portrayal of the 'Butcher of Ireland', as Cromwell is known. One wonders if Harris needed to be drunk having to present Cromwell as heroic. As it is, the movie is a good piece of entertainment. The battle scenes are well done, though wildly inaccurate.

There is obviously not the slightest hope of compressing the complicated historical events from 1640 to 1660 into 2 hours, and simplification is so inevitable as to be not worth even discussing. But the basics are presented with excellent clarity, and produced with a marvellous balance between entertaining drama and solid essentials. Guinness and Harris are both on tremendous form: the defining characteristics of Charles were vacillation and weakness, and those of Cromwell force and resolution. Both were pious in their own ways. Charles, however, thought he could do what he liked in his position because God had put him there. Cromwell didn't share this belief, and that is what makes him a great man, and a great architect of the British political values which lasted for so long. The ruthless crushing of the threat in Ireland has to be addressed, of course, and perhaps I'll add something on that at a later date.

I hear it's wildly innacurate. That's probably true, and our teacher pointed out plenty of innaccuracies in the segments we watched in class, but there are also many important things the film gets right: for instance, that the crowd at Charles' execution groaned instead of cheering. What makes Cromwell so great in spite of any inaccuracies, though, is its portrayal of its principal characters. Other reviews accuse Cromwell of overacting, but that's the sort of man he was really was (apparently his quote which begins with 'Why in the bowels of Christ...!' is an actual quote). Cromwell is sympathetic as a man who felt that he was compelled by neccesity, to do things which at first he found unthinkable. Charles I is equally or even more sympathetic as a human being crucified for abstract values, but who manages to meet his end with an astonishing amount of dignity. The scene of his execution almost brought tears to my eyes.There's something about the old-fashioned cinematography in Cromwell, also, which it makes it more convincing than more recent, slicker historical epics like Elizabeth. It conveys a sense of real life and real history. Cromwell and Charles are given emphasis on the screen more by their behavior than by any trick of the camera.The one major flaw in the film is its inexplicable ending - in which, against the background of a gothic chorus, a narrator explains what a great human being Cromwell was. The film has shown a different, more complex reality.

Yet it does not really explain who Cromwell was and if he had real objectives of his own beyond his religious rhetoric. It also clearly explains why this period could not go beyond that transitory and imperfect compromise of the least bad in a difficult period leaving the better and the best for later.The film depicts a king who was absolutely tied up in his feudal belief that he had been appointed by God and had no accounts to give to any one. This dominant feudal position was also the dominant legal position: there was no law and no jurisprudence that enabled a king to be dismissed by any authority other than death and God. On that question Cromwell represented a new point of view that had never existed anywhere else in the Christian world at the time. What does human society have to do in such a situation? Move on and let history do what it wants. So they moved on and had the king beheaded after a three days' hearing that could hardly qualify as a trial.Could there have been a compromise moving towards any parliamentary democracy? No, for three main reasons. First the king was stubborn and probably not very swift, at least not able to understand that God is a very good fellow but that on earth we work with compromises and not absolute authority. Second parliament, or what was left of this long parliament, was not elected by the people as is repeated galore of times in the film, but only by a few tens of thousands of people: the propertied and business owning tax paying people and these people, landowners first, could have in their chattel some human serfs or indentured servants who were nothing but a property of some type. These of course, the vast majority of the people had no right to vote. Third Cromwell never accepted to move towards a wider and more open definition of democracy like the Levelers were asking and he even had one of their leaders hanged. In other words the two civil wars led to a draw and nothing else and the only way out was to disband parliament and to rule alone.But the film - that is maybe too old for that - could have questioned history a little bit more and insisted on the essential and contradictory elements of the period. First it is Parliament that introduced for the first and only time in England a body of state censors to implement official censorship of anything published before publication. The discourse about religious freedom was in fact a very one-sided approach of that freedom: freedom provided the Catholics be chased and hunted, the Anglican church and all chapels have no bishops and archbishops, (which was nearly impossible to implement with the Anglican church, and yet they tried). It would have been interesting to show that tremendously sectarianism if not fundamentalism on the side of the moderate puritans like Cromwell as well as on the side of the most committed people beyond this revolution.But the film is absolutely silent on the main subject: the economy. The great expansion to the Americas (northern essentially) but also to the Indian Ocean and to Africa, started under Elizabeth, went on under James I and Charles I, but also went on and even accelerated under Cromwell. But this great expansion was not paid by the Crown for the simple reason the Crown had no fleet whatsoever. The fleet was a merchant fleet in the hands of the mercantile societies and companies that started being set up, and the sailors were those of these companies ,including the militarized ones necessary for the security of that commerce. The Royal fleet was still to come and will be for some time still. If they had thought of that they would have understood the importance of this period in England: it liberated the energy of these merchants because many controls and obligations set under the kings were dropped or eased out.That would also explain why Cromwell had to summon Parliament when he wanted to fight his naval war against Spain (essential for the development of maritime commerce), he had to go to Parliament to ask the Members of Parliament who directly represented or were the merchants in question to accept to lend their ships and their sailors to organize some fleet. That's what happened under Cromwell again.That would also explain what we can think of the readiness of history to accept change. England was not ready for a true parliamentary system of the people for the people by the people. Free and general elections were not even thought of possible. The Industrial Revolution was not even in the making yet. And habeas corpus and other fundamental human rights were not yet even imagined. That will need the Restoration which will be a failure with the second king, James II, and the Glorious Revolution that will oust him. Cromwell at least had the great merit of not trying to force history, or at least not too much, and what he did more or less survived his time after the restoration. The beheading of the king was useless, probably a mistake as Tony Benn thought, but he refused to become a King in his place. He stopped short of the irreversible mistake that would have brought him down in less than a year probably. In other words he was on that point as prudent as Napoleon who did not take the title of King after the French Revolution.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",4,Slightly unsatisfying,1316390400,"09 19,

First BIG flaw...Cromwell is shown as a main player at the battle of Edgehill.  In the movie, he actually starts the battle because he looses his temper.  FACT: Cromwell was NOT at Edgehill.  He came AFTER the battle had ended (yep...English Civil War 101.)  In the movie Cromwell utters the famous Edgehill prayer (Oh Lord, thou knowest how busy I will be this day...)  FACT: Not only did Cromwell NOT say this prayer but it was actually said by a ROYALIST commander at Edgehill, Sir Jacob Lord Astley.  So, as you can see, this movie simply goes down hill historically from here.  True, Cromwell was a great commander, true, he did (sort of) lay the foundations for the modern British Army (i.e the New Model Army.)  HOWEVER...virtually everything in this movie attributed to Cromwell he didn't do.  So why the hype to make him a hero?  ""Cromwell"" came out the same time as ""Patton"" (which slammed the British very unfairly.)  It was a response to ""Patton"" and the British producers wanted to make Cromwell into a sort of Parliamentarian version of Georgie P.  In fact, when I was in London, ""Cromwell"" came out and the logo was a mailed fist holding aloft a Lobster-pot helmet.  So, is this movie worth buying?  A guarded yes...the Naseby battle scene is decent (one of the best musket-pike battles I've seen on the screen.)  And..the best scene with Cromwell throwing out the Long Parliament makes this movie worth owning.  This scene is awesome, and is the BEST coup d'etat scene I've ever seen in a movie.  It's also fairly accurate and is actually toned down from what really happened (In real life, Cromwell began cursing and swearing...in the movie he doesn't do this.)  So remember...Cromwell had nothing to do with Edgehill or the Edgehill prayer, BUT despite historical flaws the scene with Cromwell throwing the Long Parliament out makes the movie worth owing.  Face it...how many of us have dreamed someone would do this to our stupid congress?...think about that and you'll see realize how awesome this movie is despite the flaws.  ""Cromwell"" also has decent costumes to boot.  The film originally had some scenes of Cromwell in Northern Ireland.  When the movie came to America, these scenes disappeared (politically incorrect maybe?)  One final point with historical glitches, Prince Rupert is depicted as a dolt in the movie. He was in reality quite a good commander and ended up returning to England during the Restoration to become a fairly successful admiral (yep...talk about a radical job change...he went from being a cavalry general to an admiral...and a pretty good admiral at that!)",3,The History is completely wrong...but it's still a good movie,1214092800,"06 22, 2008",2008,2929,"['can', 'not', 'imagine', 'why', 'anyone', 'would', 'even', 'dare', 'show', 'movie', 'history', 'class', 'especially', 'MILITARY', 'history', 'class', 'BUT', 'have', 'teacher', 'who', 'make', 'mistake', 'will', 'get', 'A', 'remember', 'following', 'points', 'will', 'also', 'show', 'drastic', 'flaws', 'history', 'movie', 'First', 'BIG', 'flaw', 'Cromwell', 'shown', 'main', 'player', 'battle', 'Edgehill', 'movie', 'actually', 'battle', 'temper', 'FACT', 'Cromwell', 'was', 'NOT', 'Edgehill', 'came', 'AFTER', 'battle', 'had', 'ended', 'yep', 'English', 'Civil', 'War', '101', 'movie', 'Cromwell', 'famous', 'Edgehill', 'prayer', 'Oh', 'Lord', 'thou', 'knowest', 'how', 'busy', 'will', 'be', 'day', 'FACT', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'Cromwell', 'NOT', 'say', 'prayer', 'was', 'actually', 'said', 'ROYALIST', 'commander', 'Edgehill', 'Sir', 'Jacob', 'Lord', 'Astley', 'So', 'can', 'see', 'movie', 'simply', 'down', 'hill', 'historically', 'here', 'True', 'Cromwell', 'was', 'great', 'commander', 'true', 'did', 'sort', 'lay', 'foundations', 'modern', 'British', 'Army', 'i.e', 'New', 'Model', 'Army', 'HOWEVER', 'virtually', 'everything', 'movie', 'attributed', 'Cromwell', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'So', 'why', 'hype', 'make', 'hero', 'Cromwell', 'came', 'out', 'same', 'time', 'Patton', 'slammed', 'British', 'very', 'unfairly', 'was', 'response', 'Patton', 'British', 'producers', 'wanted', 'make', 'Cromwell', 'sort', 'Parliamentarian', 'version', 'Georgie', 'P.', 'fact', 'when', 'was', 'London', 'Cromwell', 'came', 'out', 'logo', 'was', 'mailed', 'fist', 'holding', 'aloft', 'Lobster-pot', 'helmet', 'So', 'movie', 'buying', 'guarded', 'yes', 'Naseby', 'battle', 'scene', 'decent', 'one', 'best', 'musket-pike', 'battles', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'screen', 'And..the', 'best', 'scene', 'Cromwell', 'throwing', 'out', 'Long', 'Parliament', 'movie', 'owning', 'scene', 'awesome', 'BEST', 'coup', ""d'etat"", 'scene', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'also', 'fairly', 'accurate', 'actually', 'toned', 'down', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'real', 'life', 'Cromwell', 'began', 'cursing', 'swearing', 'movie', ""n't"", 'do', 'remember', 'Cromwell', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'Edgehill', 'Edgehill', 'prayer', 'BUT', 'historical', 'flaws', 'scene', 'Cromwell', 'throwing', 'Long', 'Parliament', 'movie', 'owing', 'Face', 'how', 'many', 'have', 'dreamed', 'someone', 'would', 'do', 'stupid', 'congress', 'think', ""'ll"", 'see', 'realize', 'how', 'awesome', 'movie', 'flaws', 'Cromwell', 'also', 'decent', 'costumes', 'boot', 'film', 'originally', 'had', 'scenes', 'Cromwell', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'When', 'movie', 'came', 'America', 'scenes', 'disappeared', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'maybe', 'One', 'final', 'point', 'historical', 'glitches', 'Prince', 'Rupert', 'depicted', 'dolt', 'movie', 'was', 'reality', 'quite', 'good', 'commander', 'ended', 'up', 'returning', 'England', 'Restoration', 'become', 'fairly', 'successful', 'admiral', 'yep', 'talk', 'radical', 'job', 'change', 'went', 'being', 'cavalry', 'general', 'admiral', 'pretty', 'good', 'admiral']",N/A

I hope no one is looking for any history lessons here. Sir Thomas Fairfax founded the New Model Army, not Cromwell who only commanded the cavalry during the initial stages of that army's creation.

It is so pitiful that I feel bad picking on it but someone must speak up and tell the truth about this movie. Good acting talent (Richard Harris and Alec Guiness) is wasted on the worst possible screenplay. I think I could have written a better screenplay as could have the the bag boy at your favorite supermarket. And the history? If this was being shown to school kids in England, it's no wonder the country is socialist. I have read C.V. WEDGEWOOD'S three-volume work on the English Civil War twice so I know something about that conflict. In CROMWELL, the facts are over-simplified to the point of absudity. Charles I is portrayed as a stuttering namby-pampy bullied by his Catholic wife. Oliver Cromwell is shown as a righteous advocate for ""democracy"". The Cavaliers are thugs and greedy, oppressive rich; the Puritans are shown as innocent, hard-working farmers. You can see who our heros are in CROMWELL. In reality, both sides claimed the support of noblemen, craftsmen, laborers, farmers and townsmen. Also, the puritans saw pleasure and luxury as sinful and probably would have liked to impose their strict, black-and-white lifestyle on all of England. CROMWELL would have been much more interesting and truly educational if it had opted to present a balanced view of both sides. Beyond that, the characters are paper-thin and the dialogue painful. The costumes and sets seem pretty good so, for that, I'll give CROMWELL one star. Stay away from this one.

Although the direction and musical score have some problems, the film has great cinematography and is complemented with the talents of Sir Alec Guiness and Sir Richard Harris in the leading roles.Charles I was King of England in early to mid-17th century England. A king married to a devoutly Catholic and foreign queen, Charles I soon found himself in the political aftermath of the reformation and Henry VIII's creation of the Church of England. In addition to the religious-political paradox he found himself in, Charles I sought to retain his power by abolishing Parliament leading him to civil war. Oliver Cromwell was a devout Puritan who soon became the leader of the Roundheads against the Royalists. After taking command of the army and disposing of Charles I, Cromwell appointed himself as a dictator and ruled over parliament for several years during the period called the 'Interregnum' .The best performance in the film is that of Alec Guiness as Charles I. He takes all of the royal airs of the monarch down to his light speech impediment. Although some have complained about Richard Harris' performance, I thought his theatrics and shouting accentuated the fact that Cromwell was a religious fanatic and politically inflexible: this disposition is adequately demonstrated by historical fact. Not only was Cromwell unwilling to compromise with the disposition of Charles I, he was intolerant and unmoving with the rest of England and was considered too rigid even by the Puritans themselves.The worst part of the film is the soundtrack. The liturgical choir in the background presents Cromwell as some divine liberator which he wasn't. As history shows, Cromwell became just as arbitrary and inflexible in his politics as Charles I. Yes, Cromwell had very deep convictions about religion and governance but then, don't all religious zealots?Again, this film has a great cast with beautiful costumes and reenactments. It's uneven in how it seeks to present the characters and theme: although it seems to show Charles I in a good light, it improperly places Cromwell on some biblical podium with the overdone choir music shouting ""Rejoice in the Lord.""

I'm sure liberties were taken with the actual history, but how many historical films *don't* do that? The gist is still there, and the characterizations are delicious--Richard Harris as a bombastic, larger-than-life Cromwell; Alec Guinness the saintly (in his own mind), unfortunate Charles I; Robert Morley the pompous Manchester. The cast members resemble their characters, and despite the almost Shakespearean delivery, there's no overacting going on. These guys are portraying major historical figures and doing it in a major historical way, and they make it pretty darn memorable too.The only thing I really dislike is the soundtrack. The incidental music is dated, and some of the music integral to the plot, such as the choruses sung by the marching armies, isn't even in the same cosmos as what 17th-century people would have actually heard. That's why I took a star off, but it's not like it ruins the movie.If you're interested in the English Civil War, you could do worse than see this film as an introduction.

Cromwell is a Christian, Puritan; living simply and zealously for God, somewhat like the Amish, but without the Amish isolation from society. Cromwell is a middle-class nobleman, land-owner.A couple of noblemen pretend to be on the side of Cromwell; so they can undermine him in battle.

161891,A220FJEQNGMSRN,080011471X,Trevor Willsmer,"[5, 6]","A valiant and not entirely successful attempt at a very English 'thinking-man's' epic, Cromwell is one of the most interesting of the historical dramas of the early seventies - and also one of the most flawed.The first third of the film is very ropey indeed, with banal dialogue full of stilted clich&eacute;s (the best lines are from history, not Ronald Hardwood or Ken Hughes), a very mannered performance Richard Harris and a clumsy dilution of history. It is only too easy to think that the English Civil War was fought because Cromwell didn't get on with the King's wife and that it was  won and lost on the outcome of two battles.The first battle scene is surprisingly weak - even the extras die unconvincingly - and it is not until its aftermath and the training of the New Model Army that the film really finds its feet and gets some fire in its belly. Hughes saves his visual imagination for the Battle of Naseby, (long since turned into a motorway by the decree of an ungrateful Parliament) and gives a surprisingly gripping account of its aftermath that puts some humanity into the history.As a warts and all portrait, the wart is most definitely missing but Richard Harris' Cromwell is a complex and convincing character, always being forced into action rather than forcing events. Alec Guinness' Charles I is also a considered portrait, a mixture of integrity and pragmatic duplicity (recalling Parliament to raise finance for a war with the Scots, he ends up allied to his enemies against his own politicians) that is entirely understandable and on occasion even sympathetic.The cast of supporting players for the most part prove rather less convincing. Nigel Stock is quietly impressive as the King's ultimately disillusioned confidante and Geoffrey Keen solidly reliable as ever as one of Cromwell's political allies; but while Timothy Dalton's Prince Rupert of the Rhine cuts a dash as he brings his pooch into battle on his arm, Patrick Wymark's Royal advisor is a parody worthy of Blackadder the Third - as Guinness points  out, ""You're too loud, Lord Stafford. It is most unpleasant to the ear.""The first hour has no driving force or feeling of the relentless rush towards an irreversible destiny: the force of history is almost totally absent. Similarly, it does not really gain that much in Scope. Geoffrey Unsworth's photography is ill-served by the production and costume design and Hughes lack of visual sense. Indeed, much of this first third is surprisingly slipshod. There are  some very clumsy edits, both on sound and picture and Frank Cordell's often damaging score offers an object lesson in how not to score a film.Where Miklos Rozsa and Dimitri Tiomkin integrated their grandiose style into the fabric of the drama, composer Frank Cordell points every action with sledgehammer subtlety with crescendos on every move and under every key line of dialogue. Atrociously spotted with no faith in the  audience's intelligence, there is too much Benjamin Britten in Cordell's music, which is more of an opera than a film score. Some of the problem can be put down to the appalling mixing that results in the score overpowering a scene rather than underplaying it. Only in the preparations for battle does it gain the grim restraint it needs to work.Not a great film - for that it really needed a better script, score and director - but, after a very bad start, a very good one.Some of the opening credits are so finely printed that they are unreadable (as they are on the video) but otherwise the print quality is quite superb, as if taken from a brand new print, though lovers of the roadshow era will be disappointed that Columbia have removed the Overture and well-timed Intermission.

161892,A2ONX15N6TWDR,080011471X,Vincenzo L.,"[6, 7]","Cromwell was an ambitious undertaking for Director Ken Hughes and his two stars Richard Harris and Alec Guinness. He managed to capture the spirit of that part of the 17th century even if he didn't get all his facts right.Like the many tellings of the story of Mary Tudor and Mary Stuart which have them in climatic meeting, we have Oliver Cromwell and Mary Stuart's grandson, Charles I meeting not once, but several times. They too never met, but the story demands it.In point of fact Oliver Cromwell was a minor figure in the war between the Crown and Parliament until the Parliamentary Army lost a series of battles and looked like they were going down for the count. It was at that point that Cromwell emerged as a military leader. It turned out that this previously obscure member of Parliament who had no previous military training had a natural genius for warmaking. He turned that army around and eventually Parliament won.Cromwell could have been George Washington at this point and retired to the farm, but he used his prestige and not as reluctantly as this film shows to make himself the military dictator of Great Britain with the title of Lord Protector.The experience of Cromwell's reign scarred the English body politic for generations and to a large degree the American one as well. The whole struggle over which interpretation of Christianity would hold sway was something all of the ancestors of the American founding fathers had to deal with. That's when the idea came to them to have no established religion in America. Cromwell's large standing Ironsides Army enforcing his dictatorship led to a positive mania about no standing armies, no quartering of troops and even the right to bear arms. All this because of a collective memory of the Lord Protector.Richard Harris is a lean and mean Cromwell who keeps saying he just wants to go back to the farm, but somehow winds up grabbing for more power. Alec Guinness is the perfect conception of that luckless monarch Charles I. Please note the relationship between Guinness and Queen Henrietta Marie played by Dorothy Tutin. Two things should be remembered there. First Henrietta Marie is the sister of Louis XIV of France, a monarch with considerable more power than Charles has. Note how Tutin is constantly berating Guinness for not standing up to the Parliament. He does and see where it gets him. Secondly Charles I is one of the very few English monarchs with no royal paramours. He and the Queen were actually in love and he knew her advice was from the heart if it proved disastrous.Please note a couple of other good performances, Timothy Dalton as Prince Ruppert of the Rhine, Charles's nephew from Germany who actually was a whole lot smarter than he's shown here. And Robert Morley as the Earl of Manchester, one of Cromwell's rivals in the Parliamentary camp.Oliver Cromwell died in 1658 quite suddenly and within two years the Stuart Monarchy was restored under Charles II, oldest son of Charles I and Henrietta Marie. The collapse of the Protectorate is a subject that English historians have some raging debates over. It was very much like the collapse of the Soviet Union in our time. The collapse of the Protectorate and the Restoration of the Stuarts was filmed in Douglas Fairbanks Jr.'s The Exile and really needs an up to date treatment.Cromwell as a film is magnificently photographed and directed and actually won an Oscar for costume design.

Overall a great cinematic achievement .",5,Magnificent,966038400,"08 12, 2000",2000,2066,"['magificent', 'cinematic', 'portrayal', 'English', 'civil', 'war', '17th', 'century', 'England', 'amp', 'complex', 'character', 'Oliver', 'Cromwell___', 'brilliant', 'costumes', 'enchanting', 'scenery', 'amp', 'evocative', 'musical', 'score.Cromwell', 'across', 'truly', 'remarkable', 'historical', 'figure', '.Some', 'folks', 'may', 'take', 'exception', 'supposed', 'quot', 'ruthlessness', 'quot', 'amp', 'cruelty', 'chopping', 'off', 'Charles', '1', 'head', 'Napolean', 'Bonaparte', 'said', 'have', 'aptly', 'remarked', '___', 'quot', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'omelette', 'smashing', 'few', 'eggs', 'quot', 'what', 'king', 'head', 'worth', 'when', 'compared', 'freedom', 'entire', 'people', 'Sir', 'Alec', 'Guiness', 'who', 'died', 'last', 'week', 'impeccable', 'performance', 'playing', 'role', 'wishy-washy', 'supercilious', 'Charles', '1st', '.Harris', 'think', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'playing', 'Cromwell___', 'rough-hewn', 'full', 'courage', 'iron-willed', 'raspy-voiced', 'obstinately', 'determined', 'make', 'crown', 'subservient', 'will', 'parliament', '.Finally', 'important', 'point', 'glossed', 'age', 'instant', 'soundbites', 'pollyanish', 'drooling___', 'DEMOCRACY', 'IS', 'NOT', 'THE', 'NATURAL', 'STATE', 'OF', 'MAN', '.For', 'instance', 'finishing', 'off', 'King', 'Cromwell', 'farm', 'Oxford', 'hoping', 'members', 'parliament', 'will', 'govern', 'justly', '.No', 'such', 'luck', 'thy', 'make', 'hash', 'things', 'thanks', 'narrow', 'bickerings', 'amp', 'corruption', '.Cromwell', 'had', 'make', 'comeback', 'amp', 'send', 'parliament', 'packing', 'assumed', 'full', 'powers', 'became', 'quot', 'Lord', 'protector', 'England', 'quot', 'office', 'served', 'till', 'death', '1658', '__having', 'successfully', 'laid', 'foundations', 'modern', 'democracy', 'England', '.The', 'obvious', 'lesson', 'countries', 'toying', 'democracy', 'atleast', 'embryonic', 'stages', 'do', 'need', 'want', 'better', 'term', 'quot', 'strong', 'man', 'quot', 'quot', 'quot', 'upstart', 'quot', 'quot', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'petty', 'considerations', 'pay', 'amp', 'However', 'only', 'luckiest', 'countries', 'get', 'Cromell', 'do', 'tough', 'job', 'Overall', 'great', 'cinematic', 'achievement']",N/A
