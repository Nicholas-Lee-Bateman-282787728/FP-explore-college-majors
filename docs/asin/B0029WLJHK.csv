1257441,AMAZJD40RGRI4,B0029WLJHK,B5B,"[5, 11]","None of us can yet review the actual show as it has not yet been released. All of those complaining that this is a rip off because it is the same as the original should wait until it has been released and then view it before being so negative. At least wait until more info is available on the changes.  If you do not want to risk buying it then don't. Certainly many viewers do not watch for the art behind making a show, but just want entertainment. This is likely not for them, and the season box sets will be enough.Personally, I believe many creators would love to have the chance to re-edit their pilot having both the freedom from producers/studios as well as knowledge of where the story and characters ended up. I very much look forward to seeing the changes and directions that Brad Wright takes this and comparing it to the original. Hopefully, I will learn something about the creative process and fall in love with a new show all over again.  I plan to update this review once I have seen the show.I am happy to support anything Brad Wright does. The Stargate franchise and the studio has been reasonable in the cost and releases of their DVDs, unlike others who charge outrageous amounts for their shows (ST) or release them in half seasons for more money (BG).

1257443,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,B0029WLJHK,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[7, 12]","I'm not sure the remastered and re-edited version of the series' pilot, ""Stargate SG-1: Children of the Gods"", on DVD, will win any new fans to the franchise, but I'm pleased that Brad Wright, the 'guiding light' of the TV series, cared enough to try to improve upon it, after 12 years. His changes are largely cosmetic (looping dialogue...including ALL of Christopher Judge's, cleaning up scratchy scenes, improving mat paintings and FX, and utilizing more of Joel Goldsmith's music), but he did make a few very noticable edits (eliminating seven minutes), that actually do tighten and improve the film.The most obvious cut is, of course, removing Vaitiare Bandera's full-frontal nudity, in the scene when she is possessed by the worm-like Goa'uld symbiote; no one in the production team wanted nudity in what was intended as a family show, but Showtime, which first aired the series, thought it would spice things up...it didn't, and actually hurt the overall story. Eliminating the most graphic moments now makes the episode 'family-friendly'.Some redundant and inane dialog has also been eliminated, including my least favorite line in the entire story, when Amanda Tapping tells a room full of male officers that the location of her sexual organs didn't affect her performance of duty (using a bit more graphic terms). It was a dumb line, even in 1997, out of character, and in the script solely for it's shock value. Thanks, Brad, for chopping it!There are still uncorrected errors; without the Air Force advisor who caught errors in later episodes, there are glaring mistakes in military protocol, and uniforms (I wince, every time I see the scene with an airman wearing both a major's gold leaves AND a staff sergeant's stripes)...I wish these had been addressed, but I assume the budget would only stretch so far.While there is only one special featurette, a short piece on Brad Wright's reasons for making this edition, the film commentary, by Wright and series star Richard Dean Anderson, is bright and very funny (and reveals that Anderson will be making a surprise appearance on the latest entry in the franchise, ""Stargate Universe"").

Children of the Gods wasn't one of my favorite episodes, anyway; now we're being served leftovers with a few french fries and a Coke.After the series ended, the producers figured they could make individual episodes and sell them as independent productions. They got off to a shaky start with ""Ark of Truth,"" and then hit gold with ""Continuum."" Now we're getting leftovers.I doubt we can expect much more except the trash marketed as ""Stargate Universe,"" which is one of the most awful concoctions imaginable. Even leftovers would be preferable.As for the production itself, ""Children of the Gods"" is probably worth buying, though I wish they had continued the story on through Kawalski's demise. (I always thought killing him off was a mistake, as he could have easily been a spin-off for another show.) Overall, though, the only disappointment was the Abydos graphic that looked cheesy and unfamiliar. Brad Wright should have made it look more realistic and reminiscent of the movie. In short, they should have used a real desert and dropped in a pyramid.It also was a great (missed) opportunity to explain why people on the other side of these gates could communicate without knowing English. Wright could have written in a segment explaining this, but instead the entire series erred in never addressing it. Some cultures SG-1 gated to had suits with collars and other clothing that looked like it could have been bought at Macy's.I approved of them removing the Macgyver line because it was later used by Sam when she and O'Neill were trapped in the North Pole and also in STARGATE ATLANTIS.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[20, 27]","Most TV shows spun off from movies are uninvolving and uninteresting (""Blade,"" anyone?), and hopefully die and are forgotten.That wasn't the case with the spinoff of the 1995 movie ""Stargate,"" an okay science fiction movie that spawned an excellent television series. And ""Stargate SG-1: Children of the Gods -- a recut and polished-up version of the original pilot movie -- is actually far better than it sounds, with a tightened narrative, souped-up special effects (more modern puddles), and a more dramatic soundtrack.The Stargate has been inactive for a year -- until it is activated, and a bunch of Egyptian-styled warriors come through and kidnap a young officer. General Hammond (Don S. Davis) pulls Jack O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson) out of retirement to learn what really happened on the planet of Abydos, and where these mysterious aliens have come from.O'Neill and a small team go to Abydos and encounter Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks) who has been learning about a vast network of Stargates over the past year. But when Daniel's wife Sha're and brother-in-law Skaara are abducted by the same warriors, O'Neill, Jackson and Air Force scientist Sam Carter (Amanda Tapping) use the Stargate to venture to where they're being kept.What they find is an alien race who inhabits human hosts, the Goa'uld, and their ruthless slave warriors, the Jaffa. Carter, O'Neill and Jackson are captured by the powerful Apophis -- but to escape, they must have the help of an unlikely ally: Teal'c (Christopher Judge), one of the Jaffa.""Stargate SG-1: Children of the Gods had some beginning-of-series awkwardness, and even the recut scenes don't quite cover this (Teal'c is still an enigma, and the team hasn't quite gelled into the trusting, close-as-family unit). But it shows the seeds of what would become an excellent TV series, both in the overall arc storyline and the standalone episodes.It also has some wonderfully snappy, tart dialogue, mostly provided by the brilliant O'Neill. The Egyptian-styled sets and effects have a slightly low-budget style, but the script adds some brilliant twists to the original idea, such as hundreds of Stargates scattered through the cosmos. And the makers add some warm scenes, such as the eager Abydonian teenagers celebrating with O'Neill and his pals, which really makes the characters seem human.As for the recut edition, it's actually not as bad as it sounds; there aren't any George Lucas-style mega changes just for the heck of it (the Abydonians aren't suddenly replaced by screeching dancing CGI bands). It's mostly about tightening up the original episode. The soundtrack is made more dramatically orchestral, and apparently the actors did a bit of rerecorded vocals (honestly, I didn't notice, but I wasn't listening carefully). It also some has some nice behind-the-scenes information about the recut movie and going back to the series' start, and a fun little commentary with Richard Dean Anderson and Brad Wright.Additionally, dialogue is trimmed off (Sam's silly ""reproductive organs"" spiel) or added back in (""Anyone can send a NOTE!""), the special effects are tweaked (the event horizon has been turned a more luminous blue, and the pyramid matte painting has been replaced), and some alternate takes have been inserted (Sam's audible yelp when Jack shoves her through the Stargate). The most controversial aspect of it is that Share's full frontal nude scene has been removed, which is bad or good depending on your attitude -- apparently the creators never wanted it, but they were forced to.The cast is also quite good -- Michael Shanks and Richard Dean Anderson have excellent chemistry as the cynical military man and the enthusiastic nerd, both of whom are still struggling with their own personal tragedies. Tapping is also quite good as a capable scientist/soldier, but Judge sadly doesn't get to show much of his formidable range as Teal'c (although you can see little flickers here and there of his awesomeness).""Stargate SG-1: Children of the Gods"" was a good start to the classic, epic sci-fi series, and despite a few controversial twiddles the ""Final Cut"" is a solid polish-up of the original TV movie.

That makes me wonder what else is missing, however I saw it so many years ago I'm not sure what else they tampered with.It is a great introduction to the series.

It had many good character moments in it, it had a stock footage shot from the film on Abydos of the pyramid, and music from the film too. But this version seem to want to get as far away from the film as possible even though it's suppose to follow on from it. Many of the charater moments are removed, the stock shot from the film is replaced by crapy-looking CGI effects, and much of the music is totally different.This version also seems rushed. They cut out many good scenes as well as some of the action itself. They even sped up many of the scenes themselves, and now instead of excellent performaces we have our charaters saying lines really fast as if the actors are just trying to get the scene out of the way so they can go home as soon as they can. I know that's not what they did, but with the editing the way it is, it seems that way when watching it. And there's not much time to get to know our charaters either.They also cut out the nudity scene. What's up with that! I liked that scene. Not only because it had a beautiful naked woman in it, but the scene was also saying how ruthless the Goa'uld are. Without that scene it makes them seem less ruthless. I thought the point was to make them very ruthless? That was the point of the show. The Goa'uld are the bad guys and bad guys are suppose to be ruthless. The ruthless the better. It's also a lot scarier when you actually see the nudity too. It hurt the pilot greatly when they cut that scene out. Now this new version may be the better version to show the kids. But this show is more for adults anyway so I don't see what the big problem is with having a little nudity in it.They also cut out the cliffhanger ending. Which, I suppose, is better if you don't want the whole series. But if you do, then the original cliffhanger ending is better.In all, I wasn't too impressed with this version.

Expositional scenes that are establishing the basis of the series (which are wordy and slow the pace of the original pilot) are trimmed. The action is tighter. The movie has also been re-scored, whereas the pilot contained re-hashed music from the original Stargate feature film. There are also a handful of new shots, improved special effects, and a re-recording of Teal'c's voice (no longer does he have that strange accent that he had in the pilot, but it is now in keeping with the rest of the series).There is no longer any graphic nudity. Carter no longer makes the cringe-inducing comment about her reproductive organs being on the inside, nor does she say she can ""McGuyver"" anything, and a continuity error has been removed regarding being able to step back through the Stargate once entering (see Apophis' entrance at the beginning of the film).There are new scenes trimmed from the pilot now restored in this film.

1257464,A1C78H0PP3V9WZ,B0029WLJHK,"Matthew Atanian ""Yotsuya""","[1, 1]","This remastered version of the pilot of the television seriesStargate SG-1works well as a stand alone feature, and if all you ever plan to watch is this then I would definitely recommend it. However, if you are looking for something to work as an introduction to the television series, then I would say you should avoid this and just stick with the original version (which would be available as part of the season one DVD set or with the complete series collection).Yes, this version does have some improvements. Some of the effects are better. Even though it has its detractors, I think that the redubbing of Teal'c's dialogue works well. Some of the added bits of scenes are nice. And (while I'm not one to object to it) the nudity in the pilot did seem out of place and would also make the show difficult to introduce to children, so the removal of it is not a loss.However, some of the other things that were cut are moments that, as a fan of the show, were memorable and now are very noticable in their absence. The extra banter between O'Niell and Hammond before getting right down to business may have slowed down the pacing a bit, but showed a hint of the relationship those two characters would build as the show progressed. Sam's ""reproductive organs"" line was indeed cringe worthy, but the fact that much later in the series it is jokingly referenced at least twice leaves those later references as orphaned punchlines with no set up. I hated the removal of Sam's usage of ""McGivering"" the Starrage, a nice little in-joke that didn't stick out like a sore thumb if you didn't get the joke but would put a brief smile on your face if you did.And worst of all, I think, is removing the elements that led to the episode ending on a cliffhanger that would be picked up on the following episode. That is why I said that this version works well as a stand alone feature, and it is clearly how the powers behind the scenes treated it when they prepared it.

When I heard it was coming I preordered the DVD thinking it would enhance my collection. OK some stuff was cleaned up and a few things restored but then things were also removed which led to a couple of inconsistencies later on. I guess the idea was to make the ""pilot"" more in line with the rest of the series. Why? It was a pilot in large part based on the first movie, which is just fine. People have said that is was OK to remove the brief ""nude"" scene. Well it wasn't for me. Frankly I liked that bit because lets face it, she had a beautiful body, and the scene fitted into the storyline just fine. Apophis and his mate wanted to admire the body in which she was to exist. Also removed is the Kowalsky storyline which is a problem for later.Removing Sam's McGuyver reference was another annoyance. Maybe some younger people might not get it but it was a nice little homage to RDA's past. There is more but it has been covered before. While I think that changing the music was OK, it wasn't necessary, and I think the stuff that was removed in this version could have been left in, as well as returning the deleted scenes. Really with a recut version I expect to get more for my money not less. It should be an addition to a series which it isn't.Casual viewers of the show or newbies may enjoy it but I think most fans of the show will be disappointed.

A masterful job and I've been a fan since the Kurt Russell movie!Brad Wright went back to his original 1994 pilot and cleaned it up; he changed several scenes, added CGI in a few places that  needed it (without the invasive stuff that plagued Star Wars: A New Hope when Lucas tried the same thing), got rid of the scratches and marks, and even had Christopher Judge redo a few scenes to make it come across better.I do miss the nude scene with Ms. Bandera, sigh.  But I digress.Watching this reawakened my love for this series and why it lasted for ten full years of excitement and adventure.  The big, bad Goauld, the betrayal of T'lck, the struggle between military orders and humanity by General Hammond.I forgot how much tougher the military was in this pilot.  They really, really wanted to set off that nuclear bomb and send it through the gate!  Even Hammond was saying how much he just wanted to bury the damn thing and wish they never unearthed the thing.And the actors are so young!  The meeting with Captain Carter was cleaned up to where she is not bragging about her reproductive organs being on the inside than the outside...blah blah.  If you have seen the original original, you know this did not work well at all.  Brad Wright cut all that and with some re-editing made it a much more positive meeting.The development of the plot points and the establishment of Apophus and the loss of Shari and Skara was very intense.A dedication to the memory of Don S. Davis, the actor who played General Hammond and passed away in 2008, was a touching thought.The DVD has a making-of, an interview with Wright, and a discussion of the many changes that were done with the pilot.

This is the first episode of SG-1, also known as the ""pilot"" (I thought ""Stargate The Movie"" was the pilot).  If you've got SG-1 Season 1 or the entire series (and who doesn't?), then you've already got the original version of ""Children of the Gods"".  It has been remastered, and tinkered with, but it is still low-definition DVD, not High-Def Blu-ray.  In my opinion the ""tinkering"" promises more than it delivers (i.e., the improvement isn't that obvious, because the story defines the movie), and I object to anything being deleted from the original, particularly for the sake of polical correctness.  I'll wait for the Blu-ray, hopefully with the cut scenes restored---maybe they can call it the ""Re-Extended Edition"", or ""Final Re-Edit""By the way ""The Movie"" although long available on Blu-ray, has been re-mastered yet again asStargate (15th Anniversary Edition) [Blu-ray] ---so the old Blu-ray extended cut is selling for a buck or twoStargate (Extended Cut) [Blu-ray].  True, the original Blu-ray sufferes from some minor defects if you look hard on a big screen, but again it is the story which defines the movie.  The most eggredious ""defect"" of the movie (preserved in the original blue-ray) was crappy camera techinique--lotsa lens flair which washes out many scenes---which no ""remastering"" can recover.  So I don't plan on buying the 15th Anniversery edition.  If you still haven't yet upgraded from a ""full screen"" DVD original cut, the original blu-ray extended cut that people are virtually giving away is a good opportunity.On the otherhand, every dollar which is spent purchasing re-releases of re-releases of Stargate anything probably matters to an accountant somewhere who is considering the profitablility of bringing back SGU---so, by all means, buy every new Stargate anything anybody offers for sale.
