This movie provides a rare opportunity to see Dean Martin playing a bad man. And this is also a  very rare opportunity to see an actor playing a bad guy can be charming. As  long as your initials are D.M., it is not possible to be nasty, even when  you are playing a bad guy ! So whether or not Dean Martin was the best  choice for this role is arguable. Probably, the character that George  Peppard played (good guy) would be much suitable for Dean Martin as people  are always used to see him as a kind and happy-go-lucky persona.As for  the technical details of DVD, it is in wide screen format.

George Peppard plays the anti-heroic hero, typical of westerns (and many other genres) in the mid 1960's.  Jean Simmons is great as the female lead, stil very lovely at 40-ish, playing a tough but vulnerable woman with guts and determination.  JOhn McIntyre is great as the aging former sherriff who can still teach the young guys a few lessons.The plot is fairly simple, quite unrealistic and certainly nothing new for a western -- the bad guy came to town as a lawman, slowly bullying his way into 51% ownership of every business in town.  One business owner (Simmons) is still holding out, refusing to be intimidated into selling out.  She is trying to run a stage coach line - with only one stage coach - and has brought in McIntrye and his protege Peppard for help.  They have become part owners in the business.  After an initial reluctance to get involved, and a few cat and mouse games with Dino, Peppard finally throws his lot in with Simmons in a big way.  They fall in love during the proceedings, of course.  The final showdown between Dean and his henchmen and Peppard's crew is an old fashioned shoot-em-up, blow-em-up melee.Pretty violent by 1967 standards, though mild compared to Peckinpah's contemporaneous work.  The lynching scene at the beginning has the power to disturb, and Dean smacks Jean Simmons around in another scene.Very little humor, except a few of McIntyre's saltier remarks, and one scene in which Simmons and Pppard try to drink one another under the table.Peppard and Simmons make a good romantic pairing, considering the fact that she was several years older than him.",4,"a forgotten, but good little western",1189036800,"09 6, 2007",2007,1729,"['Dean', 'Martin', 'bad', 'guy', 'one', 'good', 'job', 'being', 'ruthless', 'cold', 'completely', 'conscience', 'George', 'Peppard', 'anti-heroic', 'hero', 'typical', 'westerns', 'many', 'other', 'genres', 'mid', '1960', 'Jean', 'Simmons', 'great', 'female', 'lead', 'stil', 'very', 'lovely', '40-ish', 'playing', 'tough', 'vulnerable', 'woman', 'guts', 'determination', 'JOhn', 'McIntyre', 'great', 'aging', 'former', 'sherriff', 'who', 'can', 'still', 'teach', 'young', 'guys', 'few', 'lessons.The', 'plot', 'fairly', 'simple', 'quite', 'unrealistic', 'certainly', 'nothing', 'new', 'western', 'bad', 'guy', 'came', 'town', 'lawman', 'slowly', 'bullying', 'way', '51', '%', 'ownership', 'business', 'town', 'One', 'business', 'owner', 'Simmons', 'still', 'holding', 'out', 'refusing', 'be', 'intimidated', 'selling', 'out', 'trying', 'run', 'stage', 'coach', 'line', 'only', 'one', 'stage', 'coach', 'brought', 'McIntrye', 'protege', 'Peppard', 'help', 'have', 'become', 'part', 'owners', 'business', 'initial', 'reluctance', 'get', 'involved', 'few', 'cat', 'mouse', 'games', 'Dino', 'Peppard', 'finally', 'lot', 'Simmons', 'big', 'way', 'fall', 'love', 'proceedings', 'course', 'final', 'showdown', 'Dean', 'henchmen', 'Peppard', 'crew', 'old', 'fashioned', 'shoot-em-up', 'blow-em-up', 'melee.Pretty', 'violent', '1967', 'standards', 'mild', 'compared', 'Peckinpah', 'contemporaneous', 'work', 'lynching', 'scene', 'beginning', 'power', 'disturb', 'Dean', 'smacks', 'Jean', 'Simmons', 'scene.Very', 'little', 'humor', 'few', 'McIntyre', 'saltier', 'remarks', 'one', 'scene', 'Simmons', 'Pppard', 'try', 'drink', 'one', 'table.Peppard', 'Simmons', 'make', 'good', 'romantic', 'pairing', 'considering', 'fact', 'was', 'several', 'years', 'older']",N/A

He is an ex lawman, that, for reasons never fully explained, has gone bad.  The town he helped clean up is now ruled by him with an iron fist, and he has his stake in all the businesses in town - except for Molly Lang's (Jean Simmons) stagecoach.  She brings in ex Marshall (John Mcintyre, adding some old style Hollywood class) and his ex Deputy Dolan (George Peppard) to run the stagecoach.  When Peppard sees the mood in the town, he figures as a gambling man the odds are against him, and he decides to stay on the sidelines until he can leave.  But how long will his conscience stay unpricked as the situation deteriorates around him..?  The story is all `been there, done that', and the photography and music are very much Hollywood churning the latest of hundreds of Westerns - so it's slickly done, if uninventive, and yet it certainly has a surprising streak of violence in places.  Someone shot in the face, fist fights to the death, Martin smashing a man's face off the bar until he is unconscious... perhaps the desire to compete with the European Westerns which were popular by this time?On the whole though, Peppard is surprisingly amiable company, and holds his own against Martin, who is a show stealer with his role as Flood.  Martin was not taken entirely seriously for his acting by many, and yet here he brings probably the only 3 dimensional character to the movie.  Flood has charisma, is likeable to a point, is understandable, and yet has a mean streak and occasional temper that make you completely believe in the town being terrified of him.  Simmons on the other hand is a fine actress but her role seems to start well but goes nowhere.  Watch out for Slim Pickens playing.. well, Slim Pickens.  The gunfights work fine, if really nothing new, the fistfights are, as mentioned, quite brutal, and so the pace keeps moving along quite nicely.  All is shown in a very clean and bright transfer, in, as far as I could tell, original ratio which showed off the able cinematography nicely.",3,"Worth watching, not for B movie plot, but A movie actors",1341705600,"07 8, 2012",2012,2220,"['thoroughly', 'B', 'movie', 'Western', 'plot', 'elevated', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'performances', 'perfectly', 'enjoyable', 'oater', '1967', 'Western', 'probably', 'most', 'notable', 'having', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'play', 'bad', 'guy', 'Flood', 'ex', 'lawman', 'reasons', 'never', 'fully', 'explained', 'gone', 'bad', 'town', 'helped', 'clean', 'up', 'now', 'ruled', 'iron', 'fist', 'stake', 'businesses', 'town', 'Molly', 'Lang', 'Jean', 'Simmons', 'stagecoach', 'ex', 'Marshall', 'John', 'Mcintyre', 'adding', 'old', 'style', 'Hollywood', 'class', 'ex', 'Deputy', 'Dolan', 'George', 'Peppard', 'run', 'stagecoach', 'When', 'Peppard', 'mood', 'town', 'gambling', 'man', 'odds', 'are', 'stay', 'sidelines', 'can', 'leave', 'how', 'long', 'will', 'conscience', 'stay', 'unpricked', 'situation', 'him..', 'story', 'been', 'there', 'done', 'photography', 'music', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'Hollywood', 'churning', 'latest', 'hundreds', 'Westerns', 'slickly', 'done', 'uninventive', 'yet', 'certainly', 'surprising', 'streak', 'violence', 'places', 'Someone', 'shot', 'face', 'fist', 'fights', 'death', 'Martin', 'smashing', 'man', 'face', 'bar', 'unconscious', 'perhaps', 'desire', 'compete', 'European', 'Westerns', 'were', 'popular', 'time', 'whole', 'though', 'Peppard', 'surprisingly', 'amiable', 'company', 'own', 'Martin', 'who', 'show', 'stealer', 'role', 'Flood', 'Martin', 'was', 'not', 'taken', 'entirely', 'seriously', 'acting', 'many', 'yet', 'here', 'probably', 'only', '3', 'dimensional', 'character', 'movie', 'Flood', 'charisma', 'likeable', 'point', 'understandable', 'yet', 'mean', 'streak', 'occasional', 'temper', 'make', 'completely', 'believe', 'town', 'being', 'terrified', 'Simmons', 'other', 'hand', 'fine', 'actress', 'role', 'start', 'well', 'nowhere', 'Watch', 'out', 'Slim', 'Pickens', 'playing..', 'well', 'Slim', 'Pickens', 'gunfights', 'work', 'fine', 'really', 'nothing', 'new', 'fistfights', 'are', 'mentioned', 'quite', 'brutal', 'so', 'pace', 'moving', 'along', 'quite', 'nicely', 'shown', 'very', 'clean', 'bright', 'transfer', 'as', 'far', 'could', 'tell', 'original', 'ratio', 'showed', 'able', 'cinematography', 'nicely']",N/A

345714,A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9,6302920957,William Amazzini,"[3, 3]","Universal Pictures has literally dug into their vaults for this rare, intense sixties western,Director Arnold Lavin's 'ROUGH NIGHT IN JERICHO'-1967 made when the Euro Western was making a dent in the genre and the states were holding on to the old tried and true oaters.  It's the same old story, a one time lawman turns megalomaniac and decides to run the town of Jericho but the stubborn stage coach owner refuses to give up her rights.  After sending notice to a former US Marshal to come and defend the town, the marshal is accompanied by his assistant who slowly realizes that right makes might.  The film is an intense experience under the wonderful performances by George Peppard, Jean Simmons, and John McIntire but the film is truly owned by Dean Martin who graced many Westerns but here turns in a truly villainous performance.  Martin was never taken seriously in his film work and mores the pity when you see such excellent work such as this.  His Alex Flood character is truly amazing and on repeated viewings makes you really grasp his relentless grip on his order of the town.  With beautiful images by Photographer Russell Metty and a nice music score by Don Costa, we are witness to the last of the truly by rote American Westerns of the late sixties and Lavin pores on the intensity to the last frame. Peppard gives his always heroic performance and Simmons gives her role a grittiness which never seems to be realized.  Highly recommended to all Western lovers and those who only thought Dino was only a show business singer. Along with Director Andrew V. Maclaglen's 'BANDOLERO'-1968. its his best performance ever. Universal releases it in a crystal clear 2.35 DVD-R transfer with no extras.",5,Dino's A Bad Boy,1337904000,"05 25, 2012",2012,1712,"['Universal', 'Pictures', 'literally', 'dug', 'vaults', 'rare', 'intense', 'sixties', 'western', 'Director', 'Arnold', 'Lavin', ""'ROUGH"", 'NIGHT', 'IN', ""JERICHO'-1967"", 'made', 'when', 'Euro', 'Western', 'was', 'making', 'dent', 'genre', 'states', 'were', 'holding', 'old', 'tried', 'true', 'oaters', 'same', 'old', 'story', 'one', 'time', 'lawman', 'megalomaniac', 'run', 'town', 'Jericho', 'stubborn', 'stage', 'coach', 'owner', 'give', 'up', 'rights', 'sending', 'notice', 'former', 'US', 'Marshal', 'come', 'defend', 'town', 'marshal', 'accompanied', 'assistant', 'who', 'slowly', 'right', 'might', 'film', 'intense', 'experience', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'George', 'Peppard', 'Jean', 'Simmons', 'John', 'McIntire', 'film', 'truly', 'owned', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'who', 'graced', 'many', 'Westerns', 'here', 'truly', 'villainous', 'performance', 'Martin', 'was', 'never', 'taken', 'seriously', 'film', 'work', 'pity', 'when', 'see', 'such', 'excellent', 'work', 'such', 'Alex', 'Flood', 'character', 'truly', 'amazing', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'really', 'grasp', 'relentless', 'grip', 'order', 'town', 'beautiful', 'images', 'Photographer', 'Russell', 'Metty', 'nice', 'music', 'score', 'Don', 'Costa', 'are', 'witness', 'last', 'truly', 'rote', 'American', 'Westerns', 'late', 'sixties', 'Lavin', 'pores', 'intensity', 'last', 'frame', 'Peppard', 'always', 'heroic', 'performance', 'Simmons', 'role', 'grittiness', 'never', 'be', 'realized', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'Western', 'lovers', 'who', 'only', 'thought', 'Dino', 'was', 'only', 'show', 'business', 'singer', 'Director', 'Andrew', 'V.', 'Maclaglen', ""'BANDOLERO'-1968"", 'best', 'performance', 'ever', 'Universal', 'crystal', 'clear', '2.35', 'DVD-R', 'transfer', 'extras']",N/A

Hancock,"[0, 0]","Looked forward to writing a good...or great... review of this DVD movie, which I saw years ago and enjoyed immensely (Great Dean Martin performance) but, sorry to say, I can't do that in this case. Though I ordered ""Rough Night In Jericho"" and had a packaged something mailed to me that REPRESENTED itself as being ""RNIJ"", I'm sorry to say it was NOT what it represented itself to be. It came FACTORY-SEALED.....SUPPOSEDLY from the Universal Vault series (and because it WAS factory-sealed in plastic it was NOT Amazon's fault that this disaster occurred)...but, when I opened the DVD case (which had Geo. Peppard  & Dino on the cover) I found inside it a CARTOON FEATURE from the WARNER BROS. ARCHIVES (NOT Universal). What I found was titled ""A FLIGHT OF DRAGONS"". NOT what I was expecting AT ALL!!!  I therefore give fair warning here to anyone interested in purchasing this particular film in the future. Beware. You might be getting something you haven't bargained far.",1,Buyer Beware,1389571200,"01 13, 2014",2014,974,"['Looked', 'forward', 'writing', 'good', 'great', 'review', 'DVD', 'movie', 'saw', 'years', 'ago', 'enjoyed', 'immensely', 'Great', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'performance', 'sorry', 'say', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'case', 'ordered', 'Rough', 'Night', 'Jericho', 'had', 'packaged', 'something', 'mailed', 'REPRESENTED', 'being', 'RNIJ', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'say', 'was', 'NOT', 'what', 'represented', 'be', 'came', 'FACTORY-SEALED', '..SUPPOSEDLY', 'Universal', 'Vault', 'series', 'WAS', 'factory-sealed', 'plastic', 'was', 'NOT', 'Amazon', 'fault', 'disaster', 'occurred', 'when', 'opened', 'DVD', 'case', 'had', 'Geo', 'Peppard', 'Dino', 'cover', 'found', 'CARTOON', 'FEATURE', 'WARNER', 'BROS.', 'ARCHIVES', 'NOT', 'Universal', 'What', 'found', 'was', 'titled', 'FLIGHT', 'OF', 'DRAGONS', 'NOT', 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'AT', 'ALL', 'therefore', 'give', 'fair', 'warning', 'here', 'anyone', 'interested', 'purchasing', 'particular', 'film', 'future', 'Beware', 'might', 'be', 'getting', 'something', 'have', ""n't"", 'bargained', 'far']",N/A
