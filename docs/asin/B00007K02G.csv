730003,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,B00007K02G,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[6, 8]","I knew this would happen, knowing how many books get turned into bad movies, especially the work of literary giants like Edith Wharton.  If you are NOT a reader of fine literature, you may like this movie - a simple romance, like millions of other movies.But if you have read Wharton's classic novelette, one of the finest pieces of work, you would dislike this movie immensely.  Wharton was born in 1862 and died in 1937 at 75 years.  She won a Pulitzer Prize in Literature forThe Age of Innocence.With a unique writing style, one that absorbs the reader into deeper thoughts and greater description, fine prose, and without rushing through the plot.The 1993 film's cinematography was beautiful, characters were nothing memorable and the focus of the story was missing, the intense relationships, the gravity of suspense, the extent of the deeper personalities we so became used to.  Liam Neeson does a decent job at playing Ethan, but we really miss what and who Zeena, Mattie and Ethan are all about.  The book is not about sex or lurid romance, it is subtle.  That is what needs to come across in a Wharton based movie, and Hollywood doesn't do that, and you can't expect them to.  And reading the book, one can instantly recognizes ""movie scenes"", predicting which scenes Hollywood will use.  Ethan Frome is not meant for the big screen!If you are willing to delve into dramatic plays, try  Best American Plays: 1918-1958 Supplementary Volume Complete for a captivating, engaging, play based on the book Ethan Frome.  The play was first staged in 1936 and the adaption of of the book is done by a father and son team, Owen Davis and Donald Davis.  This play is wonderful!!!But, try the bookEthan Fromeand see why this should never had been turned into a Hollywood movie.  .....Rizzo",1,You can never turn the work of Edith Wharton into a movie!!,1253318400,"09 19, 2009",2009,1787,"['knew', 'would', 'happen', 'knowing', 'how', 'many', 'books', 'get', 'turned', 'bad', 'movies', 'especially', 'work', 'literary', 'giants', 'Edith', 'Wharton', 'are', 'NOT', 'reader', 'fine', 'literature', 'may', 'like', 'movie', 'simple', 'romance', 'millions', 'other', 'movies.But', 'have', 'read', 'Wharton', 'classic', 'novelette', 'one', 'finest', 'pieces', 'work', 'would', 'dislike', 'movie', 'immensely', 'Wharton', 'was', 'born', '1862', 'died', '1937', '75', 'years', 'won', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize', 'Literature', 'forThe', 'Age', 'Innocence.With', 'unique', 'writing', 'style', 'one', 'reader', 'deeper', 'thoughts', 'greater', 'description', 'fine', 'prose', 'rushing', 'plot.The', '1993', 'film', 'cinematography', 'was', 'beautiful', 'characters', 'were', 'nothing', 'memorable', 'focus', 'story', 'was', 'missing', 'intense', 'relationships', 'gravity', 'suspense', 'extent', 'deeper', 'personalities', 'so', 'became', 'used', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'decent', 'job', 'playing', 'Ethan', 'really', 'miss', 'what', 'who', 'Zeena', 'Mattie', 'Ethan', 'are', 'book', 'not', 'sex', 'lurid', 'romance', 'subtle', 'what', 'come', 'Wharton', 'based', 'movie', 'Hollywood', ""n't"", 'do', 'ca', ""n't"", 'expect', 'reading', 'book', 'one', 'can', 'instantly', 'recognizes', 'movie', 'scenes', 'predicting', 'scenes', 'Hollywood', 'will', 'use', 'Ethan', 'Frome', 'not', 'meant', 'big', 'screen', 'are', 'willing', 'delve', 'dramatic', 'plays', 'try', 'Best', 'American', 'Plays', '1918-1958', 'Supplementary', 'Volume', 'Complete', 'captivating', 'engaging', 'play', 'based', 'book', 'Ethan', 'Frome', 'play', 'was', 'first', 'staged', '1936', 'adaption', 'book', 'done', 'father', 'son', 'team', 'Owen', 'Davis', 'Donald', 'Davis', 'play', 'wonderful', 'try', 'bookEthan', 'Fromeand', 'see', 'why', 'should', 'never', 'had', 'been', 'turned', 'Hollywood', 'movie', '..Rizzo']",N/A

730006,A1OB5L3WMHJAD9,B00007K02G,Christopher Culver,"[0, 1]","The 1993 British-American television production ETHAN FROME is an adaptation of Edith Wharton's 1911 novel about star-crossed lovers in late 19th-century Massachusetts. Though Wharton was a wealthy New York socialite, she had glimpses of New England village life, and it was the harsh winters, dire poverty and cruel gossip of this region that she sought to portray. The eponymous character (played by Liam Neeson) is a young farmer in the fictional Massachusetts community of Starkfield, whose dreams of making something of himself are dashed by the early death of his parents and then his marriage to the sickly Zenobia ""Zeena"" Frome (Joan Allen). When Zeena's cousin beautiful cousin Mattie Silver (Patricia Arquette) comes to help out in the house, Ethan's heart is thawed, but ultimately the uncompromising conditions of Starkfield life bring Ethan and Mattie to a tragedy.The plot of a pair of star-crossed lovers is rather overdone, but ETHAN FROME is interesting in its depiction of a Massachusetts village in the late 19th century, complete with characters speaking in dialect and a description of country farmhouses. This adaptation does a decent job of presenting those strengths of the novel. It also offers an improvement on the novel in that it tweaks Wharton's risible climax -- Ethan and Mattie deciding to escape this cruel world by sledding down a hill into a big elm tree, the stupidest means of suicide in all of literature -- to be more believable.The adaption is flawed, however, by a number of factors. One is the decision to change the framing story of Wharton's novel. In the book, the visitor to Starkfield who spurs the flashback is an engineer who wonders why Frome is so taciturn. In this film, however, the visitor is the town's new preacher, just out of seminary, who protests against Frome being shunned by the town. Wharton's portrayal of a man who walls himself off by the world after multiple tragedies is replaced, then, by an element completely unknown to the novel: the castigation of the villagers as ignoring basic Christian charity. This has consequences for the ending, which is much less powerful than the novel. Another unwelcome change is that Ethan and Mattie sleep together, while in Wharton's novel the characters seem incapable under their dire circumstances of having even a physical relationship. Also, Liam Neeson offers some of the best acting in the film, but he's 10 years too old to play this role.I first saw this film when it was shown on PBS nearly two decades ago, and it works well enough as passive entertainment on television, but this is a second-rate affair in many ways and I cannot recommend getting the DVD.",2,A deeply flawed adaption of Edith Wharton's novel,1332028800,"03 18, 2012",2012,2675,"['1993', 'British-American', 'television', 'production', 'ETHAN', 'FROME', 'adaptation', 'Edith', 'Wharton', '1911', 'novel', 'star-crossed', 'lovers', 'late', '19th-century', 'Massachusetts', 'Wharton', 'was', 'wealthy', 'New', 'York', 'socialite', 'had', 'glimpses', 'New', 'England', 'village', 'life', 'was', 'harsh', 'winters', 'dire', 'poverty', 'cruel', 'gossip', 'region', 'sought', 'portray', 'eponymous', 'character', 'played', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'young', 'farmer', 'fictional', 'Massachusetts', 'community', 'Starkfield', 'dreams', 'making', 'something', 'are', 'dashed', 'early', 'death', 'parents', 'then', 'marriage', 'sickly', 'Zenobia', 'Zeena', 'Frome', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'When', 'Zeena', 'cousin', 'beautiful', 'cousin', 'Mattie', 'Silver', 'Patricia', 'Arquette', 'help', 'out', 'house', 'Ethan', 'heart', 'thawed', 'ultimately', 'uncompromising', 'conditions', 'Starkfield', 'life', 'bring', 'Ethan', 'Mattie', 'tragedy.The', 'plot', 'pair', 'star-crossed', 'lovers', 'rather', 'overdone', 'ETHAN', 'FROME', 'interesting', 'depiction', 'Massachusetts', 'village', 'late', '19th', 'century', 'complete', 'characters', 'speaking', 'dialect', 'description', 'country', 'farmhouses', 'adaptation', 'decent', 'job', 'presenting', 'strengths', 'novel', 'also', 'improvement', 'novel', 'Wharton', 'risible', 'climax', 'Ethan', 'Mattie', 'deciding', 'escape', 'cruel', 'world', 'sledding', 'down', 'hill', 'big', 'elm', 'tree', 'stupidest', 'means', 'suicide', 'literature', 'be', 'more', 'believable.The', 'adaption', 'flawed', 'however', 'number', 'factors', 'One', 'decision', 'change', 'framing', 'story', 'Wharton', 'novel', 'book', 'visitor', 'Starkfield', 'who', 'spurs', 'flashback', 'engineer', 'who', 'why', 'Frome', 'so', 'taciturn', 'film', 'however', 'visitor', 'town', 'new', 'preacher', 'just', 'seminary', 'who', 'Frome', 'being', 'shunned', 'town', 'Wharton', 'portrayal', 'man', 'who', 'off', 'world', 'multiple', 'tragedies', 'replaced', 'then', 'element', 'completely', 'unknown', 'novel', 'castigation', 'villagers', 'ignoring', 'basic', 'Christian', 'charity', 'consequences', 'ending', 'much', 'less', 'powerful', 'novel', 'unwelcome', 'change', 'Ethan', 'Mattie', 'sleep', 'together', 'Wharton', 'novel', 'characters', 'seem', 'incapable', 'dire', 'circumstances', 'having', 'even', 'physical', 'relationship', 'Also', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'best', 'acting', 'film', '10', 'years', 'too', 'old', 'play', 'role.I', 'first', 'saw', 'film', 'when', 'was', 'shown', 'PBS', 'nearly', 'two', 'decades', 'ago', 'well', 'enough', 'passive', 'entertainment', 'television', 'second-rate', 'affair', 'many', 'ways', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'getting', 'DVD']",N/A

If you would have liked that the hero in the film is happy at the end and he is not, but his sorrow fits in with the plot, do you have the right to complain?

All of these things applied to me about this film adaptation of a famous book.I gave it only three stars, not because it depressed me or that I did not like its ending or because I like non-depressing films, but because I think that the movie moved much too slow. The acting is very good and the plot is an almost ""everyman-type"" of plot, but it develops at snail's pace.I say ""everyman-type"" plot because I see the simple slightly educated Ethan Frome experiencing what all-to-many people experience. They go through life being drawn by forces outside themselves, not doing what they want to do, but what others see as right for them. Then sometimes they are lucky. Something happens to draw them out of their lethargy. They realize that this life of theirs is not what they want; they could have something better.

Jack Warner was sure no one would care to see such hopeless material filmed, no matter how starry or surefooted the treatment.  On the basis of this plodding version, I have to agree with Jack.  American Playhouse's theatrical wing has managed to turn the book every high school student hated (Wharton's novella has done more to kill the idea of reading for pleasure for generations of students than any literary work since SILAS MARNER was thrust upon an unwary world) into a picture that's more grim duty than pleasure.  A game cast struggles to animate Richard Nelson's bare-bones screenplay, but they're soon defeated, lost in an endless progression of drab scenes that sit there, inert, rather than smouldering with emotional subtext, as presumably was intended.  Neeson and Allen come off rather better than Patricia Arquette; very attractive in other films, she seems slackjawed and dimwitted here.

Most of the facts were there, but there were added details, and a few missing things which just destroyed the message portrayed in the book.In the book, Ethan's crippled condition is only barely highlited, yet in the movie, it is dragged out to almost hillarious proportions.  This reduces the novels intended effect on viewers of the movie, as the fact that it is supposed to seem almost a punishment on Ethan is lost almost completely.  Zeena, the lifeless doll which we see with a certain sense of dread at her introduction in the novel, is a beautiful young woman when she appears in the movie, with only a little less charm later on, when, in the events of the novel, she is supposed to seem almost like death itself.  Zeena in the movie is constantly portrayed as being not as bad as we are led to see in the book, therefore making us care for her and almost wonder why Ethan would want to have an affair when he has such a 'good' wife.  Also, the character of Mattie, an innocent, vivacious character in the novel, is portrayed as a flirtatious... and almost instigates the affair more than Ethan.  In the novel, Ethan is the one who truely begins everything, secretly longing for her, but never able to express his feelings to her until he fears she will be gone.All these changes destroy the tone with which the author of the book adressed Ethan, and ruined the message that we were supposed to get out of her work.  Instead of feeling for the characters of Ethan and Mattie as the evil Zeena destroys Ethan, we feel a sense of disgust at Mattie and Ethan's affair.  While the movie was true to the book in many ways, it was the ways in which it wasn't that make this movie sub-par, and almost disgraceful to the book.",2,It was a good book,1076544000,"02 12, 2004",2004,1823,"['Ethan', 'Fromme', 'great', 'romance', 'book', 'however', 'books', 'movies', 'go', 'one', 'worst', 'Most', 'facts', 'were', 'there', 'were', 'added', 'details', 'few', 'missing', 'things', 'just', 'destroyed', 'message', 'portrayed', 'book.In', 'book', 'Ethan', 'crippled', 'condition', 'only', 'barely', 'highlited', 'yet', 'movie', 'dragged', 'out', 'almost', 'hillarious', 'proportions', 'novels', 'intended', 'effect', 'viewers', 'movie', 'fact', 'supposed', 'seem', 'almost', 'punishment', 'Ethan', 'lost', 'almost', 'completely', 'Zeena', 'lifeless', 'doll', 'see', 'certain', 'sense', 'dread', 'introduction', 'novel', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'when', 'movie', 'only', 'little', 'less', 'charm', 'later', 'when', 'events', 'novel', 'supposed', 'seem', 'almost', 'death', 'Zeena', 'movie', 'constantly', 'portrayed', 'being', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'are', 'led', 'see', 'book', 'therefore', 'making', 'care', 'almost', 'wonder', 'why', 'Ethan', 'would', 'want', 'have', 'affair', 'when', ""'good"", 'wife', 'Also', 'character', 'Mattie', 'innocent', 'vivacious', 'character', 'novel', 'portrayed', 'flirtatious', 'almost', 'affair', 'more', 'Ethan', 'novel', 'Ethan', 'one', 'who', 'truely', 'everything', 'secretly', 'longing', 'never', 'able', 'express', 'feelings', 'will', 'be', 'gone.All', 'changes', 'destroy', 'tone', 'author', 'book', 'adressed', 'Ethan', 'ruined', 'message', 'were', 'supposed', 'get', 'work', 'Instead', 'feeling', 'characters', 'Ethan', 'Mattie', 'evil', 'Zeena', 'destroys', 'Ethan', 'feel', 'sense', 'disgust', 'Mattie', 'Ethan', 'affair', 'movie', 'was', 'true', 'book', 'many', 'ways', 'was', 'ways', 'was', ""n't"", 'that', 'make', 'movie', 'sub-par', 'almost', 'disgraceful', 'book']",N/A

I like Liam Neeson,but wondered how some of the themes, like sexual tension, would be portrayed so many years after the book was published (1911).  In many ways the film followed the book closely, especially in the over-all events, but since the strong sexual tensionsin the book were never released by actual consumation, the addition of a sex scene between the 2 principles was inappropriate;even had the early 20th c. approved of an actual &#34;fleshly&#34; relationship between them, the maintenance of their desire asunconsumated was much more consistent with the book's main theme--what people (especially the poor) could have, & whatthey could not, & what they could not have was freedom to make their own choices.  Duty, in the moral sense, was paramount.Thus, although I'm glad I saw this film, some of the authenticity was lost in the irrelevant loss of the tension that dominates everypage of the (powerful) book; this tension cannot, however, survive the gratuitous scene added to pander to the 20th-c.teen-age expectations.",4,Liam is Always Good.

730030,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B00007K02G,Z Hayes,"[1, 1]","I read the book by Edith Wharton,Ethan Frome (Signet Classics)many years ago and did not realize that there was a film adaptation of the book until I came across the DVD at my local library. Seeing Liam Neeson on the cover prompted me to check it out as I admire his talent and I was not disappointed. Though the film adaptation is not a faithful retelling of Wharton's story, the main actors do an excellent job in their respective roles so as to make this a truly compelling and heartbreaking romantic drama.The film is basically a story within a story, which is also employed in the book. A young and idealistic new minister arrives in the rural town of Starkfield, Massachusetts sometime at the turn of the 20th century. He sees a crippled man hobbling along in the snow and wonders why this man seems so isolated and alone, bereft of friends. It is only later that his housekeeper tells him the tragic story of Ethan Frome. Viewers are then taken via flashback to the past, about 20 or so years earlier, when Ethan Frome (Liam Neeson) is portrayed as a strapping young man who is burying his mother. His distant cousin, Zeena (Joan Allen) has been staying with them, nursing his mother until her death, and faced with the prospect of losing someone who has helped him in his time of need, Ethan marries Zeena. Their marriage however is not a success - five years later, there are no children, and Zeena has become a hypocondriac, who seems to catch any ailment there is to be caught. She persuades Ethan to allow another cousin, Hattie Silver (Patricia Arquette), a poor orphan to come and live with them. The objective is to get Hattie to help out with chores for free (a common enough custom for the time when impoverished relatives would be taken in to effectively work as household help).Well, over a period of time, the initially sickly-looking Hattie blossoms into a vibrant beauty who enjoys dances and Ethan finds himself increasingly drawn to her vivacity, a stark contrast to his own sickly and taciturn wife. Zeena senses the growing affection between Ethan and Hattie and predictably disapproves and becomes even meaner and cruel. When Zeena decides to replace Hattie, the doomed lovers are driven to a desperate act that has catastrophic consequences for all.I felt Liam Neeson excelled in his role as the sad and isolated cripple, who seems to have sunk into submission in the present - in stark contrast to his younger days. Joan Allen plays the role of mean and calculating Zeena with credibility and conviction. As for Arquette, she is tolerable in her role, but not very compelling. Perhaps this is due to my own bias, having read the book and not 'seen' the Hattie I pictured in the book being credibly played by Arquette.The fictional town of Starkside is well depicted here with a high sense of realism - the harsh winter landscape paints a bleak picture that accentuates the flaws inherent in the characters. The score goes well with the story and I think this is a wonderful adaptation of Wharton's story, even though it does take liberties (there is no sex in the book, unlike the movie).
