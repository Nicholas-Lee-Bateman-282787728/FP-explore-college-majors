Off course this being the kind of movie that it is, strange things soon begin happening. It turns out that the hotel room is haunted and it begin to drive the couple both insane and apart.I think the best way to describe this movie is boring, it have boring characters, boring plot, boring acting and is filmed in boring locations, the dialog is boring, everything is just so mediocre. I found myself checking several times while watching how much off the movie was left for I just tired of it. There is only one thing which sames The Off Season from one star and that is that it at leasts attempts for originality, the movie also try to play more on mood and characters than shock effects, to bad it falls completely flat at the attempt, however I will give the movie a start for at least trying.There are so many haunted locations movies out there, some of them good and some of them horrible, I do not see why anyone would want to bother with this mediocre film unless it was the only horror movie left they had not seen at the video store.

914415,A387BD735MI50R,B0009W5KJK,R. Schultz,"[7, 9]","This movie has a loveably amateurish quality. The actors lag along some of their lines, trying to maintain momentum through the bad pacing that's imposed on them. The action is riddled with horror movie clich&eacute;s that echo The Shining or Psycho.There's the clich&eacute; of the movie's premise itself. A young couple takes up residence in a small-town resort motel during the off-season so that the man can have the quiet he needs to work on his play. There's the clich&eacute; of the man's assurances that he's progressing with his writing, when in fact something else is going on with him. There's the clich&eacute; of the tension over what sort of assault the woman is going to face as she takes a shower.In spite of these flaws though, I enjoyed the movie and would give it a mild recommendation. It has some genuinely spooky moments. But it's main success lies in its characters. The film is populated by some people with memorable personalities who really talk to each other. This makes it a lot more interesting than most of the slick, strictly action-packed major movie productions.The elderly, slightly doddering motel owner won me over with her heartfelt regret at having supplied the couple with a stain-prone mattress for their unit. And the eccentric retired rodeo rider in the next unit is equally winning.Actor Angus Scrimm (could that be his real name?), who plays the retired rodeo rider, brought his own unique contribution to the movie. He wrote the song he sings in nostalgia over his days on the circuit out West. Mr. Scrimm sings a snatch of this song in the movie itself. But we are treated to his full rendition in the DVD's Bonus Materials.Listen to this last part of the ""Making of Off Season"" at your own risk. Mr. Scrimm's song is so irresistible, you won't be able to get it out of your head. He came up with a gem - a song that pokes fun at the cowboy mystique at the same time that it expresses a sincere enthusiasm for some of the off-beat pleasures to be found on the open range. There's a twist on ""going Brokeback"" here. When the singer's Mary is away from him in Tucumcari, he makes do. He kisses him ""a prairie dog or two.""Those cute little prairie dogs will haunt you as much as the ghosts that inhabit the off-season motel.",3,Worthwhile Despite Flaws,1155859200,"08 18, 2006",2006,2267,"['movie', 'loveably', 'amateurish', 'quality', 'actors', 'lag', 'lines', 'trying', 'maintain', 'momentum', 'bad', 'pacing', 'imposed', 'action', 'riddled', 'horror', 'movie', 'clich', 'eacute', 'echo', 'Shining', 'Psycho.There', 'clich', 'eacute', 'movie', 'premise', 'young', 'couple', 'up', 'residence', 'small-town', 'resort', 'motel', 'off-season', 'man', 'can', 'have', 'quiet', 'work', 'play', 'clich', 'eacute', 'man', 'assurances', 'progressing', 'writing', 'when', 'fact', 'something', 'else', 'going', 'clich', 'eacute', 'tension', 'what', 'sort', 'assault', 'woman', 'going', 'face', 'shower.In', 'spite', 'flaws', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'would', 'give', 'mild', 'recommendation', 'genuinely', 'spooky', 'moments', 'main', 'success', 'characters', 'film', 'populated', 'people', 'memorable', 'personalities', 'who', 'really', 'talk', 'other', 'lot', 'more', 'interesting', 'most', 'slick', 'strictly', 'action-packed', 'major', 'movie', 'productions.The', 'elderly', 'slightly', 'doddering', 'motel', 'owner', 'won', 'heartfelt', 'regret', 'having', 'supplied', 'couple', 'stain-prone', 'mattress', 'unit', 'eccentric', 'retired', 'rodeo', 'rider', 'next', 'unit', 'equally', 'winning.Actor', 'Angus', 'Scrimm', 'could', 'that', 'be', 'real', 'name', 'who', 'retired', 'rodeo', 'rider', 'brought', 'own', 'unique', 'contribution', 'movie', 'wrote', 'song', 'nostalgia', 'days', 'circuit', 'out', 'West', 'Mr.', 'Scrimm', 'snatch', 'song', 'movie', 'are', 'treated', 'full', 'rendition', 'DVD', 'Bonus', 'Materials.Listen', 'last', 'part', 'Making', 'Off', 'Season', 'own', 'risk', 'Mr.', 'Scrimm', 'song', 'so', 'irresistible', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'get', 'head', 'came', 'up', 'gem', 'song', 'fun', 'cowboy', 'mystique', 'same', 'time', 'sincere', 'enthusiasm', 'off-beat', 'pleasures', 'be', 'found', 'open', 'range', 'twist', 'going', 'Brokeback', 'here', 'When', 'singer', 'Mary', 'away', 'Tucumcari', 'do', 'prairie', 'dog', 'two', 'cute', 'little', 'prairie', 'dogs', 'will', 'haunt', 'as', 'much', 'ghosts', 'inhabit', 'off-season', 'motel']","Off Season, The"
