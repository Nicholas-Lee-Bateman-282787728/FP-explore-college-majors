841306,A3GQKB1KF0CRPE,B0002MK61E,"Deborah MacGillivray ""Author,""","[34, 34]","I utterly adored Jim Hutton in his Ellery Queen series, so when his equally talented son Tim announced he was doing Nero Wolfe I had mixed emotions.  Tim is talented; his works speaks of the quality of his career.  But so many times when a series of books such as Rex Stout's beloved 1/7 of a ton detective and his wisecracking assistant Archie are put on film, devoted fans of the books cringe at the efforts.  It's rare that a series will live up to what you have created in your minds.  Very often, they snatch the title, characters names and then they are off-and-running writing their own teleplays.  This happened with the Lee Horsley-William Conrad effort back in the early 80s.  Dreadful!  It little bore a resembled to Stout's books.  Conrad's Wolfe actually paced and sat on the edge of his desk - as all fans know Wolfe would NEVER do!!!  Off the bat, the rich period detail of this television version done for A&E; (the idiots that cancelled it!), is evocative of the same leisurely attention to quality and detail that was done on the elder Hutton's Ellery Queen.The cast is perfect, the setting of Wolfe's brownstone pulled from my imagination.  Even more so, I really recognize the faithful following of the plots of the books!It's a quality production from start to finish and A&E; should hang its head in SHAME for canceling this gem.The second season set includes:Disc 11) Death of a Doxy2) The Next Witness3) Die like a DogDisc 21) Murder is Corny2) Motherhunt3) Poison a la CarteDisc 31) Too Many Clients,2) Before I Die,3) Help Wanted - MaleDisc 41) The Silent Speaker2) Cop Killer3) Immune to MurderDisc 51) The Golden Spiders2) The Making of Nero Wolfe3) Silent Speaker (Double EpisodeLet's hope A&E; one day wakes up and put Tim and the crew back to work!",5,sheer delight!,1121904000,"07 21, 2005",2005,1779,"['utterly', 'adored', 'Jim', 'Hutton', 'Ellery', 'Queen', 'series', 'when', 'equally', 'talented', 'son', 'Tim', 'announced', 'was', 'doing', 'Nero', 'Wolfe', 'had', 'mixed', 'emotions', 'Tim', 'talented', 'works', 'speaks', 'quality', 'career', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'when', 'series', 'books', 'such', 'Rex', 'Stout', 'beloved', '1/7', 'ton', 'detective', 'wisecracking', 'assistant', 'Archie', 'are', 'put', 'film', 'devoted', 'fans', 'books', 'cringe', 'efforts', 'rare', 'series', 'will', 'live', 'up', 'what', 'have', 'created', 'minds', 'Very', 'often', 'snatch', 'title', 'characters', 'names', 'then', 'are', 'off-and-running', 'writing', 'own', 'teleplays', 'happened', 'Lee', 'Horsley-William', 'Conrad', 'effort', 'back', 'early', '80s', 'Dreadful', 'little', 'bore', 'resembled', 'Stout', 'books', 'Conrad', 'Wolfe', 'actually', 'paced', 'sat', 'edge', 'desk', 'fans', 'know', 'Wolfe', 'would', 'NEVER', 'do', 'bat', 'rich', 'period', 'detail', 'television', 'version', 'done', 'A', 'E', 'idiots', 'cancelled', 'evocative', 'same', 'leisurely', 'attention', 'quality', 'detail', 'was', 'done', 'elder', 'Hutton', 'Ellery', 'Queen.The', 'cast', 'perfect', 'setting', 'Wolfe', 'brownstone', 'pulled', 'imagination', 'Even', 'more', 'so', 'really', 'recognize', 'faithful', 'following', 'plots', 'books', 'quality', 'production', 'start', 'finish', 'A', 'E', 'should', 'hang', 'head', 'SHAME', 'canceling', 'gem.The', 'second', 'season', 'set', 'Disc', '11', 'Death', 'Doxy2', 'Next', 'Witness3', 'Die', 'DogDisc', '21', 'Murder', 'Corny2', 'Motherhunt3', 'Poison', 'la', 'CarteDisc', '31', 'Too', 'Many', 'Clients,2', 'Die,3', 'Help', 'Wanted', 'MaleDisc', '41', 'Silent', 'Speaker2', 'Cop', 'Killer3', 'Immune', 'MurderDisc', '51', 'Golden', 'Spiders2', 'Making', 'Nero', 'Wolfe3', 'Silent', 'Speaker', 'Double', 'EpisodeLet', 'hope', 'A', 'E', 'one', 'day', 'up', 'put', 'Tim', 'crew', 'back', 'work']",N/A

As was with it's predecessor, it's a collection of single and 2 part episodes that are faithful to the novels and novelettes they were taken from with Maury Chaykin as the definitive Nero Wolfe who stays at home and solves the case based on the info his legmen including Archie Goodwin (played by Timothy Hutton) and others bring him. In addition to the complete second and final season, you also get the pilot ""The Golden Spiders"" which was released a full year before Season 1.  They also provide a duplicate widescreen formatted copy of an episode from this season (""The Silent Speaker"") for comparison. Since I originally reviewed these 2 sets, A&E has released a mega set of the the full series in slim cases.

Year 2 of Nero Wolf has some excellent mysteries that move quickly and never bog down.  I particularly enjoy Archie (I love his dialogue with Phoebe Gunther) but Nero Wolfe was excellently done by Maury Chaykin (Shutup!!), rest his soul.  The music they use, largely by Michael Small is great and I dearly wish an album of the series music had been produced.Though Rex Stout wrote the mysteries over several decades, the show is wisely placed in the 50's with its definitive clothing styles.  Archie is always dressed immaculately and this adds to the flair of the shows.I think some people may have been turned off by seeing the same people in different roles from show to show.  I know I was until I understood about using an ensemble cast approach.I have enjoyed watching the Nero Wolfe several times and that is extremely important to me.

841311,A3160YSU1KRL8E,B0002MK61E,Justin Playfair,"[48, 48]","From the opening credit sequences that are never the same way twice to absolutely great swing era music as background melodies throughout the series. To colorful dresses, artistic sets, early 50's cars full of multi-colors and lots of shiny chrome, to suits and ties with hats and two- tone shoes. This is a GREAT series. Why for the love of Pete did A&E assume no one was interested? The greatest local scholar (now rest in peace) John J. Mullen, who had read every work by Rex Stout had always said that Nero Wolfe would be the hardest detective of fiction to bring to the screen in all of it's glory. (He even traveled late in his life to the site where the fictional Brownstone mansion would have been. Now that is dedication!)The reason he gave was that the characters never aged despite writing that went from the 1930's through 1974. Whatever year the book was written, THAT was the year it was. So any potential director would have to manipulate sets without the characters aging. Well, Tim Hutton took the best elements of Stout's writing and put together a legend in Detective Fiction that is a tribute to ""the normal recreation of noble minds."". You will love this series, the characters come to life before your eyes! Guys, Dolls, Dancing and Gourmet food are what you will encounter in Stout's world.
