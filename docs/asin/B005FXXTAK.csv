All the characters are well voiced in the English dub and provide good and convincing accents that don't sound awful! This movie not only shows the main plot that actually doesn't stray, but it also includes funny scenes from the episodes that were favorites among the director's, in Japan, choices to fill the 80-something time slot! If you plan on getting this movie you totally should! I got as an early Christmas for myself and it was well worth it!!! (Personally my favorite character is Canada even though he doesn't get a lot of screentime. Also I love Japan, Russia, and Italy)!",5,Hetalia is the best!!!!!!,1323561600,"12 11, 2011",2011,703,"['Ok', 'like', 'random', 'stuff', 'happening', 'adorable', 'bishies', 'mostly', 'comedy', 'Hetalia', 'one', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'voiced', 'English', 'dub', 'provide', 'good', 'convincing', 'accents', 'do', ""n't"", 'sound', 'awful', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'main', 'plot', 'actually', ""n't"", 'stray', 'also', 'funny', 'scenes', 'episodes', 'were', 'favorites', 'director', 'Japan', 'choices', 'fill', '80-something', 'time', 'slot', 'plan', 'getting', 'movie', 'totally', 'should', 'got', 'early', 'Christmas', 'was', 'well', 'worth', 'Personally', 'favorite', 'character', 'Canada', 'even', ""n't"", 'get', 'lot', 'screentime', 'Also', 'love', 'Japan', 'Russia', 'Italy']","Hetalia - Paint it, White - The Movie"

It was impossible to find anything on the movie online except short summaries of the movie. People weren't giving the plot away or what happened in the movie, and it made me excited because she couldn't wait for the movie to come out. She watched it in Japanese and it was very good.Then it came out on English. Beside my DVD having a problem where it won't play the single scene with Prussia, Ukraine and Belarus and skipping straight to the first attack the Axis and Allied had on the aliens, there was no problems with the movie overall.The English dub was funnier than the Japanese dub, but I didn't like some of the dialogue changes. I admit I was more annoyed that the English dub threw in more France/England moments that were unnecessary. I admit as a America/England shipper I only got the movie for that one scene that everyone kept talking about online, but other than that, there really much else.This movie has the only action scene in the actual series. Something you will never get out of a five minute episode. That was probably the best scene in the entire movie. That and Grampa Rome.And of course the outtakes are the best. You can tell the voice actors had fun with this especially Germany's VA. XDOverall a fun movie to watch with your Hetalia friends, but expect non-Hetalia fans to be confused especially if you skip through the 30-40 minutes of episodes from the first two seasons.And of course, I love my bandana~",4,Loved it but...,1328140800,"02 2, 2012",2012,1505,"['When', 'Hetalia', 'movie', 'was', 'first', 'announced', 'Japan', 'went', 'crazy', 'was', 'impossible', 'find', 'anything', 'movie', 'online', 'short', 'summaries', 'movie', 'People', 'were', ""n't"", 'giving', 'plot', 'away', 'what', 'happened', 'movie', 'made', 'excited', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'movie', 'come', 'out', 'watched', 'Japanese', 'was', 'very', 'good.Then', 'came', 'out', 'English', 'Beside', 'DVD', 'having', 'problem', 'where', 'wo', ""n't"", 'play', 'single', 'scene', 'Prussia', 'Ukraine', 'Belarus', 'skipping', 'straight', 'first', 'attack', 'Axis', 'Allied', 'had', 'aliens', 'was', 'problems', 'movie', 'English', 'dub', 'was', 'funnier', 'Japanese', 'dub', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'dialogue', 'changes', 'admit', 'was', 'more', 'annoyed', 'English', 'dub', 'threw', 'more', 'France/England', 'moments', 'were', 'unnecessary', 'admit', 'America/England', 'shipper', 'only', 'got', 'movie', 'one', 'scene', 'everyone', 'kept', 'talking', 'online', 'other', 'really', 'much', 'else.This', 'movie', 'only', 'action', 'scene', 'actual', 'series', 'Something', 'will', 'never', 'get', 'five', 'minute', 'episode', 'was', 'probably', 'best', 'scene', 'entire', 'movie', 'Grampa', 'Rome.And', 'course', 'outtakes', 'are', 'best', 'can', 'tell', 'voice', 'actors', 'had', 'fun', 'especially', 'Germany', 'VA.', 'fun', 'movie', 'watch', 'Hetalia', 'friends', 'expect', 'non-Hetalia', 'fans', 'be', 'confused', 'especially', 'skip', '30-40', 'minutes', 'episodes', 'first', 'two', 'seasons.And', 'course', 'love', 'bandana~']","Hetalia - Paint it, White - The Movie"

Russia's dive from the airplane, the ""France wants to marry England"" thing, England visits Japan, America talks through a pile of burgers...augh, there was just too much recycled. Other than the main characters, the other characters (Prussia, Romano, the Baltic trio, Ukraine, Belarus and Spain) got very limited screen time (I think the longest of those was the Baltics and they got about 10 seconds total).  And my final complaint is that without Grandpa Rome the world would once again be doomed!  Can't they come up with a plot where the actual current countries manage to save the day?That said, it was great to see all the boys again, although France and England both seemed to be wearing bizarre girly jumpsuits.

1459618,A2WM5NHJR2WIT8,B005FXXTAK,Rocky V Bindhamer,"[0, 0]","If you enjoy Politically Incorrect humor, you might find any of the Hetalia amusing. Although some might find some character comments; such as Germany asking Italy (English Dub) &#34;Do you WANT me to gas you!&#34; to be stretching the intentional offensiveness envelope beyond the pale. Having done some world travel myself, I found the series and movie does a good job of presenting national stereotypes as those from other countries see them, i.e. not just a Japanese-centric author's view. Even the English dubbed voice-overs stay true to the original's intention. An added bonus is the fact that you might even learn something historically or culturally you never heard before; Such as the existance of Sealand, proposed &#34;Marriage&#34; (mergers) of France and England, and other trivia.One downside I found in the movie is the Director's excessive use of &#34;callbacks&#34; or &#34;flashbacks&#34; replaying sometimes only slightly altered scenes from seasons one and two. Fortunately we are saved from both the constant title/credit interruptions that made the 5 minute episodes of the series difficult to follow, if not outright annoying, and the redundancy of scenes played as trailers then immediately replayed in the following episode. Most notably &#34;America's Storage Closet&#34;As for entertainment value for one's dollar. IMHO some of the Hetalia offers seem to be overpriced. In particular the &#34;Collector's Edition&#34; movie. There was no way in Hell I was willing to pay $999 for the collector's edition of this movie just to get &#34;Prussia's Bandana&#34; (Handkerchief). Which struck me as odd once I recieved my purchase; as I found a thin handkerchief had arrived along with the DVD inside the art box..I suggest potential buyers be wary of some high-priced anime releases sold online offering &#34;Collector's Editions&#34;.",4,Interesting & Humorous Take On Geopolitical Stereotypes,1358208000,"01 15, 2013",2013,1858,"['enjoy', 'Politically', 'Incorrect', 'humor', 'might', 'find', 'Hetalia', 'amusing', 'might', 'find', 'character', 'comments', 'such', 'Germany', 'asking', 'Italy', 'English', 'Dub', '34', 'Do', 'WANT', 'gas', '34', 'be', 'stretching', 'intentional', 'offensiveness', 'envelope', 'pale', 'Having', 'done', 'world', 'travel', 'found', 'series', 'movie', 'good', 'job', 'presenting', 'national', 'stereotypes', 'other', 'countries', 'see', 'i.e', 'not', 'just', 'Japanese-centric', 'author', 'view', 'Even', 'English', 'dubbed', 'voice-overs', 'stay', 'true', 'original', 'intention', 'added', 'bonus', 'fact', 'might', 'even', 'learn', 'something', 'historically', 'culturally', 'never', 'heard', 'Such', 'existance', 'Sealand', 'proposed', '34', 'Marriage', '34', 'mergers', 'France', 'England', 'other', 'trivia.One', 'downside', 'found', 'movie', 'Director', 'excessive', 'use', '34', 'callbacks', '34', '34', 'flashbacks', '34', 'replaying', 'sometimes', 'only', 'slightly', 'altered', 'scenes', 'seasons', 'one', 'two', 'Fortunately', 'are', 'saved', 'constant', 'title/credit', 'interruptions', 'made', '5', 'minute', 'episodes', 'series', 'difficult', 'follow', 'not', 'outright', 'annoying', 'redundancy', 'scenes', 'played', 'trailers', 'then', 'immediately', 'replayed', 'following', 'episode', 'Most', 'notably', '34', 'America', 'Storage', 'Closet', '34', 'entertainment', 'value', 'one', 'dollar', 'IMHO', 'Hetalia', 'seem', 'be', 'overpriced', 'particular', '34', 'Collector', 'Edition', '34', 'movie', 'was', 'way', 'Hell', 'was', 'willing', 'pay', '999', 'collector', 'edition', 'movie', 'just', 'get', '34', 'Prussia', 'Bandana', '34', 'Handkerchief', 'Which', 'struck', 'odd', 'recieved', 'purchase', 'found', 'thin', 'handkerchief', 'had', 'arrived', 'DVD', 'art', 'box..I', 'suggest', 'potential', 'buyers', 'be', 'wary', 'high-priced', 'anime', 'releases', 'sold', 'online', 'offering', '34', 'Collector', 'Editions', '34']","Hetalia - Paint it, White - The Movie"
