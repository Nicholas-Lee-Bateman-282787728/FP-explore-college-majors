If you go into this movie expecting a lot of popculture references, mindless dialouge, and loads of pop music, that's exactly what you will get! They also make the point that teenagers have become nothing but mindless consumers that will by anything as long as their friends think it is &quot;in.&quot; Individuallity doesn't even exist, the only thing that counts is the next big thing!The bad:As I stated this is product placement theater! Every, and I do mean every company out there has their own little spot in the movie. Some of them are funny, such as the Evian logo being placed in fish tank, but it gets way out of hand and it gets in the way of the story! The story, by the way, is about as transparent as saran wrap, and I could describe the acting using the same reference.Bottom line, if you are between 13 and 18, you'll think that this movie will get the Best Picture award at the Oscars.

So why, you may ask, would an adult man watch a DVD of ""Josie and the Pussycats"", a movie that is clearly pitched at thirteen-year-old girls?  Let me explain.  I have the soundtrack to the movie ""That Thing You Do"".  Adam Schlesinger wrote the title tune.  When I found out he co-produced the soundtrack to ""Josie and the Pussycats"" I decided to get that one too.  I was impressed.  It really rocks.  Out of curiosity I decided to rent the DVD.""Josie and the Pussycats"", the movie, is not an unheralded masterpiece, but it is a fun movie with some genuinely funny moments.  My favorite is near the beginning when we're introduced to all the main characters.  We meet Melody (Tara Reid as the very incarnation of the world's dumbest Dumb Blonde).  Melody is very sweet.  She stands by the side of the road and holds up a sign:  ""Honk if you love Hugs"".  We cut away and cut back.  The sign now reads:  ""Honk if you love Rainbows"".  We cut away again and cut back again.  The sign is now partially obsured by a telephone pole.  All we can make out is:  ""Honk if you love Pussy"".  A guy drives by and slams on his brakes.  Another guy rear-ends the first guy.  Soon there is a three car pile-up.  Melody jumps out from behind the telephone pole.  The sign reads in full:  ""Honk if you love Pussycats"".  Melody drops the sign and runs away.  Very funny.The plot, or what there is of it, is a ridiculous concoction about a giant record company putting subliminal messages into pop songs to brainwash kids into becoming brand-addicted consumer junkies.  Do we really need Hollywood to remind us that Pop Music and Big Media are in bed together to exploit the youth of America?  Still, A for effort.  Parker Posey, as the villainess behind the whole conspiracy, proves once again that she cannot act, and Alan Cumming, as her effeminate foot-soldier, proves once again that he can. Rachael Leigh Cook blends into the wallpaper as lead character Josie and Rosario Dawson is an utter washout as Val.  The best thing about the movie is the songs and they are terrific, with Kay Hanley of ""Letters to Cleo"" pulling a Marni Nixon for Rachael Leigh Cook.Adolescent girls will give ""Josie and the Pussycats"" an A.  Their mothers, who will see it with them in the theaters, will give it a B.

665495,A39PGE3IDI0VY6,B00005MEVO,"A. KAPLAN ""Penelopecat""","[6, 7]","While promoted as just another teen rock band comedy, Josie and the Pussycats is smart and sly, as well as being genuinely funny.  A satire on the prevalent band-as-marketing-tool phenomenon, the movie lets the audience know what it is in for from the very first scenes, featuring a Backstreet Boys-type boy band surrounded by a veritable plethora of product placement logos.  Using real companies' logos helps drive the message home, though it's important to point out--as the filmmakers do on their commentary track--that the companies did not pay to have their logos used, keeping the film from being too hypocritical.Obviously, the movie isn't any too subtle advocating free will over following what's popular, but it's such a likeable movie, that doesn't really matter.  As Josie, Rachel Leigh Cook is perfectly cast, projecting an air of genuine caring towards her friends.  Rosario Dawson, as the constantly neglected black Pussycat, makes her character about more than just her race, and thus makes the racist attitudes seem so much more unreasonable.  Tara Reid, as dumb blonde Melody, adds so much charm to her performance that the character comes across as more than just an object of ridicule.  And Alan Cumming and Parker Posey are delightfully over the top as the evil record company executives, who even manage to make themselves almost sympathetic at the end when their own hidden sides come to light.The extra features on this DVD are pretty nifty, though not the selling point.  I particularly enjoyed the commentary from the filmmakers, proving that if you set your sights higher than a typical teen comedy, it will show in your work.  This movie is so much better than it really has any right to be, and I'm glad I got a chance to see it.",4,Smart and funny,1006473600,"11 23, 2001",2001,1758,"['promoted', 'just', 'teen', 'rock', 'band', 'comedy', 'Josie', 'Pussycats', 'smart', 'sly', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'satire', 'prevalent', 'band-as-marketing-tool', 'phenomenon', 'movie', 'audience', 'know', 'what', 'very', 'first', 'scenes', 'featuring', 'Backstreet', 'Boys-type', 'boy', 'band', 'surrounded', 'veritable', 'plethora', 'product', 'placement', 'logos', 'Using', 'real', 'companies', 'logos', 'drive', 'message', 'home', 'important', 'point', 'out', 'filmmakers', 'do', 'commentary', 'track', 'companies', 'did', 'not', 'pay', 'have', 'logos', 'used', 'keeping', 'film', 'being', 'too', 'hypocritical.Obviously', 'movie', ""n't"", 'too', 'subtle', 'advocating', 'free', 'will', 'over', 'following', 'what', 'popular', 'such', 'likeable', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'Josie', 'Rachel', 'Leigh', 'Cook', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'projecting', 'air', 'genuine', 'caring', 'friends', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'constantly', 'neglected', 'black', 'Pussycat', 'character', 'more', 'just', 'race', 'thus', 'racist', 'attitudes', 'seem', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'unreasonable', 'Tara', 'Reid', 'dumb', 'blonde', 'Melody', 'so', 'much', 'charm', 'performance', 'character', 'more', 'just', 'object', 'ridicule', 'Alan', 'Cumming', 'Parker', 'Posey', 'are', 'delightfully', 'top', 'evil', 'record', 'company', 'executives', 'who', 'even', 'manage', 'make', 'almost', 'sympathetic', 'end', 'when', 'own', 'hidden', 'sides', 'come', 'light.The', 'extra', 'features', 'DVD', 'are', 'pretty', 'nifty', 'not', 'selling', 'point', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'commentary', 'filmmakers', 'proving', 'set', 'sights', 'higher', 'typical', 'teen', 'comedy', 'will', 'show', 'work', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'really', 'right', 'be', ""'m"", 'glad', 'got', 'chance', 'see']",Josie and the Pussycats
665496,AYSWADHW28S1A,B00005MEVO,Amazon Customer,"[1, 1]","All right, so, ""better than 'Spice World"" is pretty faint praise, but ""Spice World"" (ASIN 0767808673) was another movie in a similar vein that was far better than you might expect. The basic plot (evil music executives using subliminal messages to drive fads) is kind of lame, but it's lame in a ""good"" way.The premise facilitates unrelenting product placement and self-referential send-ups of all aspects of modern pop culture. For example, in the opening scene, the boy band of the day, called appropriately enough, ""Du Jour"", begins to suspect something is amiss with their music, at which point they become victims of plan ""American Pie"", in which their Target-logo-bedecked jet is made to crash with them on it. Seth Green's cameo performance as a spoiled band member who's upset because one of the other singers stole his ""look"", was priceless.The plot moves along quite predictably, but the music in this film is actually quite good stuff, and the humor is consistently effective and far more clever than it appears at first glance. It doesn't hold a candle to great comedies like ""Bringing up Baby"" (ASIN B00003CX9A) or ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" (ASIN B00005O3VC), but ""Josie"" does a great job of delivering exactly what you'd expect, plus maybe a tiny bit more.",4,"Better than ""Spice World""",1016668800,"03 21, 2002",2002,1278,"['right', 'so', 'better', ""'Spice"", 'World', 'pretty', 'faint', 'praise', 'Spice', 'World', 'ASIN', '0767808673', 'was', 'movie', 'similar', 'vein', 'was', 'far', 'better', 'might', 'expect', 'basic', 'plot', 'evil', 'music', 'executives', 'using', 'subliminal', 'messages', 'drive', 'fads', 'kind', 'lame', 'lame', 'good', 'way.The', 'premise', 'unrelenting', 'product', 'placement', 'self-referential', 'send-ups', 'aspects', 'modern', 'pop', 'culture', 'example', 'opening', 'scene', 'boy', 'band', 'day', 'called', 'appropriately', 'enough', 'Du', 'Jour', 'suspect', 'something', 'amiss', 'music', 'point', 'become', 'victims', 'plan', 'American', 'Pie', 'Target-logo-bedecked', 'jet', 'made', 'crash', 'Seth', 'Green', 'cameo', 'performance', 'spoiled', 'band', 'member', 'who', 'upset', 'one', 'other', 'singers', 'stole', 'look', 'was', 'priceless.The', 'plot', 'moves', 'quite', 'predictably', 'music', 'film', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'stuff', 'humor', 'consistently', 'effective', 'far', 'more', 'clever', 'first', 'glance', ""n't"", 'hold', 'candle', 'great', 'comedies', 'Bringing', 'up', 'Baby', 'ASIN', 'B00003CX9A', 'Monty', 'Python', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'ASIN', 'B00005O3VC', 'Josie', 'great', 'job', 'delivering', 'exactly', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', 'maybe', 'tiny', 'bit', 'more']",Josie and the Pussycats

I say nearly because there is one aspect of Melody that I think a human actor just cannot carry off and can only be done in animation. The rest however she did to perfection. Melody is not just another dumb, wacky blond like so many people seem to believe. She is innocence encapsulated to the point where you just love to listen to her and watch her antics. Just like Josie says to her in the film ""That's what I love about you!"" Indeed the only part of the cartoon Melody that Ms Reid couldn't pull off, and didn't even try -credit to whoever's idea this was - was the blinking of the eyes as she tries to process in her head what it was she just saw or heard.

Overnight success happens, literally overnight, and soon they find themselves being plastered on the cover of every magazine, albums selling like hotcakes and fans buzzing around them like mad bumblebees. But is everything what it seems, or does it just seem like they have it a bit too easy, or maybe their market-savvy managers have their own personal gain in mind? Directors Deborah Kaplan and Harry Elfont don't mess around with the message here: teens are overpowered by advertisements aimed at their insecurities about fitting in, and here they exploit that issue beyond logical sense (the shower curtains with McDonald's advertisements really stood out for me!) However, since the message is never pounded over your head, and since Elfont and Kaplan already assume that you already get it, it never becomes too self-aware. All of this is greatly helped by the charming performances of its leads, Rachael Leigh Cooke, Tara Reid and Rosario Dawson, with winning support from the fabulous Parker Posey, plus a great soundtrack that just never stops.

665507,A2PBV1899CX3TE,B00005MEVO,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[0, 0]","Josie and The Pussycats is a movie based on a comic book that was a spin off of the Archie series. I had a suspicion that it was really no good, but I wanted to watch it anyway because I like Rosario Dawson (Rent), Rachael Leigh Cook (She's All That), Parker Posey (The House of Yes), Alan Cumming (Romy and Michele's High School Reunion), and Seth Green (Party Monster). It was kind of cute in spots, but it was born under a misbegotten moon.First there was a parody of a boy band, called Du Jour, and Seth Green and Breckin Myer were in it. It was just kind of lame, as far as parodies go. This was mercifully brief, and then another story emerges. Wyatt Frame (Alan Cumming) and Fiona (Parker Posey) are part of a conspiracy to plant subliminal messages in music to get teenagers to buy stuff. The government is in on it, and even Carson Daly (played by himself) and Mr. Moviefone are part of the nefarious plot.---------Mr. Moviefone: Conform! Free will is overrated! Jump on the bandwagon! There is no such place as Area 51!================================When Du Jour gets wise to what is going on, Wyatt and the pilot parachute out of the plane leaving the boy band to pull a Buddy Holly:[to pilot]Wyatt: Take the Chevy to the levy.Silly as it sounds, the subliminal message subplot is actually an improvement over the boy band parody. It is sort of fun for a very brief while, but it soon grows tedious. In this spoof on consumerism, they have over 73 product placements. Yet, they were not paid for any of it, nor were they given any free samples. Though this speaks to the film maker's integrity, it is really kind of stupid. Compare and contrast to the scam Madonna pulled off when she was paid millions by Pepsi to make a commercial and gave them Like a Prayer. The commercial played maybe once before being pulled due to disturbing Catholic imagery. Madonna got the money, the publicity, and then her brand wasn't cheapened by being used to tout sugar water. That was really a successful attack against rampant consumerism. Josie and the Pussycats, the movie, was not.Wyatt needs a replacement for Du Jour, so he finds The Pussycats. He scoops them up and signs them, and within about a week they are at the top of the charts with millions of screaming fans. The subliminal messages also promote the band itself. An inside joke, one of the messages that scrolls on a marquee says ""Can't Hardly Wait' was underrated."" The writer / director team of Deborah Kaplan & Harry Elfont were responsible for that movie, too. I actually liked the musical segments with Josie and The Pussycats. Rachael, Rosario, and Tara were sent to band camp, and were actually playing (though I really doubt that it is them on the soundtrack, and Josie's lead vocals are dubbed by the singer for Letters to Cleo).I love Parker Posey, but this was no The House of Yes. One cute bit of trivia is that Carson Daly, who played himself, hooked up with Tara Reid on the set. They were engaged, even, though they later broke up.---------Carson Daly: If I wasn't a key player in this whole conspiracy to brainwash the youth of America with rock music, we could totally date!=================Bottom Line is that Josie and The Pussycats was cute in parts, but the cuteness wasn't enough to make up for the majority of the movie that was totally lame. Can't Hardly Wait showed promise for the team of Deborah Kaplan & Harry Elfont but they squandered their good will with Josie and The Pussycats.------------Alexander Cabot: You know what?

665508,A2J7B7F2J7V4DM,B00005MEVO,Chosroes III,"[0, 0]","Following the glorious example of ""Clueless"", ""Josie and the Pussycats"" is a teen comedy that asserts itself as art for the generations.  That also means, though, that ""Josie"" figures its teen target-demographic has a mind and a will of its own.  For this is a unique satire of teen crazes that also is in love with them.  The task is, mostly, to separate the loveable stuff from the pure drek.  Hence our film starts with boyband du jour Du Jour landing amid an audience of screaming fans to serenade them with the plaintive strains of ""Backdoor Lover"".  The winking irreverence of this sequence becomes more sinister when we later learn that Corporate America is-- but enough of that.  Suffice it that our real heroes are a trio of ""luscious young ladies"", played with zest and much aplomb by Rosario Dawson, Tara Reid, and Rachel Leigh Cook, who aspire to be both real musicians and rock stars.  Their punk-pop tunes like ""Three Small Words"" and ""Pretend to Be Nice"", though only huge hits in the confines of the film's fictive universe, are much better than what you're going to find on your radio, which helps to show how lovingly this film has been crafted.  Sure, it's a portrait of a dark alternate universe, but it looks an awful lot like OUR universe, thanks largely to the sledgehammer promos inserted into the production design (without any handouts from the companies involved).  And then again, with Cook, Dawson, and Reid as the girls next door, and gorgeous cinematography from Matthew Lebotique, along with a tourbus worth of saucy outfits for our heroines to squeeze into,""Josie and the Pussycats"" looks a lot BRIGHTER than our universe too.  Plus the candyland colors shine with an inspiring richness on this DVD, making ""Josie and the Pussycats"" even more of a visual epiphany than a musical one.  Alan Cumming graduates to the Richard E. Grant role in ""Spice World"", playing the world's most dastardly manager with wicked overthetop hamming, complimented by Parker Posey's catty crimeboss of a label head.  Some inconspicuous cameos might be found by the careful viewer too.

You have your Derek Zoolander type character(s) embodied in Josie and the Pussycats themselves, who were discovered out of nowhere by a music agent who needed a new band to act as a front for the music industry and its use of subliminal messages to get young people to consume products and buy into every fad alive. It really is a good set-up and one that is a great modern reinterpretation of the original Archie Comic (I would have loved to have a cameo of Archie and his friends). The movie follows a one week or so change of fortunes for Josie and their friends as they go from playing at a bowling alley where they are each paid $5 to be ignored by old men bowling strikes to being number one on Billboard. All the while, they are being used to make money. Of course, we have the classic fight between band members and ultimate redemption followed by the chance to play for real, without the subliminal messaging in front of thousands of people. And of course, sprinkle in some love and a moral or two. It all adds up to a relatively entertaining movie from the decade that spawned the ""teen movie.""

Josie and the Pussycats is bad enough to begin with (despite having the characters and general idea from the comic and early 70s TV cartoon, the movie really didn't succeed in transferring the feel of the comic to the screen -- Alexander and Alexandra are wasted); but when the viewer is assaulted by product placement throughout it just becomes too much. I have never felt so insulted by a movie.  This isn't a story, it's an hour and a half advertisement. Products and logos are so awkwardly inserted into every frame that I was overwhelmed. The filmmakers claim it's a subversive in-joke: I see it as deception.  After all, the moviegoer still had to pay to see this movie.The movie itself is a travesty.  Tara Reid has the comic timing of a slice of bologna. Her Melody (with an oddly gin soaked and cigarette hoarse voice) made me miss Jackie Joseph's pitch perfect voicework of the cartoon.  Reid is an awful actress and it's agony to watch her try (and fail) to be funny. Alan Cumming and Parker Posey were entertaining as usual but I was ashamed that they did this and am hoping these were their ""paycheck movies."" Rachel Leigh Cook spends the entire film with the same questioning, bewildered expression on her face.  Maybe she was wondering what she was doing in such a bad movie.Avoid at all costs.

In fact, it is a very clever satire of the whole teenage pop-music industry. The plot centres on an ""evil"" organization (led by Parker Posey and Alan Cumming) that is hiding subliminal messages in pop-music in order to get teenagers to buy things that they don't really want, with girl band, Josie and the Pussycats (Rachel Leigh Cook, Rosario Dawson and Tara Reid), becoming unsuspectingly involved in their scheme.In many ways this film reminded me a lot of ""The Brady Bunch Movie"" in that both of these films are films that don't take their subject matter too seriously and don't underestimate the intelligence of their audience (and are all the better for it). Both films are also filled with an ample supply of jokes (which are very funny) and ""Josie and the Pussycats"" has the added advantage that the songs that the Pussycats play are actually worth listening to (I also own the soundtrack and love it). The only drawback of this film is that there are too many musical montage sequences, particularly in the first half of the film, but that's just a minor matter and would not stop me from re-watching this film.",4,Smarter than you would imagine,1210723200,"05 14, 2008",2008,1230,"['first', 'glance', 'Josie', 'Pussycats', 'yet', 'brainless', 'movie', 'aimed', '12', 'year-old', 'girls', 'fact', 'very', 'clever', 'satire', 'whole', 'teenage', 'pop-music', 'industry', 'plot', 'centres', 'evil', 'organization', 'led', 'Parker', 'Posey', 'Alan', 'Cumming', 'hiding', 'subliminal', 'messages', 'pop-music', 'order', 'get', 'teenagers', 'buy', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'want', 'girl', 'band', 'Josie', 'Pussycats', 'Rachel', 'Leigh', 'Cook', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'Tara', 'Reid', 'becoming', 'unsuspectingly', 'involved', 'scheme.In', 'many', 'ways', 'film', 'reminded', 'lot', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'Movie', 'films', 'are', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'subject', 'matter', 'too', 'seriously', 'do', ""n't"", 'underestimate', 'intelligence', 'audience', 'are', 'better', 'films', 'are', 'also', 'filled', 'ample', 'supply', 'jokes', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'Josie', 'Pussycats', 'added', 'advantage', 'songs', 'Pussycats', 'play', 'are', 'actually', 'worth', 'listening', 'also', 'own', 'soundtrack', 'love', 'only', 'drawback', 'film', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'musical', 'montage', 'sequences', 'particularly', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'just', 'minor', 'matter', 'would', 'not', 'stop', 're-watching', 'film']",Josie and the Pussycats

But when I seen it on TV, it got a little better and soon I found myself watching this movie everytime it came on and then eventually buying the dvd and cd. I'm Pussycat obsessed!! I make sure I watch this movie at least twice a week. I even find myself quoting Val, ""You messed with the wrong Pussy!"" LOL I love this movie. Tara Reid did a superb job of portraying Melody Valentine, and airheaded blonde. Rosario Dawson was really kewl as Valerie Brown, the street smart pussycat (I've only seen her on ""Down To You"" as the stoner girl, so this was nice seeing her in a real acting role). And finally, Rachael Leigh Cook was really kewl as Josie McCoy, the singer. I loved when she let the subliminal messages get to her and she told off Mel and Val. ""What's the matter snuggle-bunny?? Realizing the world ain't all sunshine and rainbows?"" and this one ""Puppies grow into dogs, who get old and DIE!"" LOL Oh this is gonna be a cult classic. And it really does make you think if record companies are brainwashing the youth of america with subliminal messages, because I know too many girls who act like the freaky fans.I also think Alan Cumming and Parker Posey did a great job being the villans of the flick.

665528,A3PJQ4742VN84H,B00005MEVO,"Hope this helps ""help""","[0, 0]","Josie and the Pussycats are one of the most iconic figures in cartoon/comic history.  I had been both familiar with them from both the Archie comics as well as the Hanna-Barbera cartoon adaptation.  When the film originally came out, I originally did not see it because I was still a kid without my own money and frankly, ""remakes"" were popularly seen as always terrible at the time.  But seeing it, now, I totally wish I had been there to watch it in the theaters.  The film is not only a worthy expansion (Archie comics built off of it and added it to their Pussycats lore) for Josie and the Pussycats, but is a light and meaningful film that gives you some things to think about.  And definitely, the early 2000s film ""innocence"" is quite refreshing from today's trend of overly-dark plots and over-seriousness.CONTENT ISSUES:Well, as another reviewer pointed out there are two different versions of the film...a PG version and a PG-13 version.  That reviewer purchased the PG version.  I, on the other hand, have the PG-13 version.  And there are definitely key differences.  In short, the PG version is a ""family friendly"" version with all the innuendos, double entendres, and cursing either taken out completely or voiced over.  The PG-13 version keeps all of that still in.  So, if you are thinking of purchasing this for kids, the PG version would be a good move and you can find it here on Amazon (I checked haha)...and honestly, you wouldn't be missing much at all.  In fact, I dare say that the cussing and whatnot often felt out of place in the whimsical nature of this film.But with that said, as far as the content of the PG-13 version, there was cussing, but it wasn't all too often.  In fact, I noticed more of it in the outtakes than in the film itself.  But the words do include the S-word, B-word, and the D-word.  Did not hear an F-word.  As to the innuendos,, I only noticed 3 instances...in fact, one of them I missed until someone mentioned it haha.  I was quite surprised at the scarcity (which I appreciated) since some of the reviews made it seem like more.  They were jokes.  One was when Melody was holding up different signs on the side of the road.  One of which was ""Honk if you love Pussycats""...except the ""cats"" part of it was blocked by a telephone pole...needless to say that did cause a car accident.  The other two were double entendres that can be taken innocently enough or dirty.  In addition to this, other points to note are that Melody does have a shower scene, but it is a shoulder-up shot...none of those body silhouette things.  And it's completely not portrayed in a sensual manner (think the shower seen in Alfred Hitchcock's film ""Psycho"").  Also, the fashion is very early 2000s late 90s pop star styles in case that is a particular concern for some folks.  But none of it really looks risque...as in uber tight and curvaceous.  Even the one dress that Josie wears to a dinner party with a lower-than-normal cut didn't seem all that ""sexual"".PLOT (ABSOLUTELY NO SPOILERS EXCEPT WHEN LISTED):The narrative is by no means ground breaking or earth shattering.  But it is whimsical, imaginative, yet believable and ""real"".  This is a story about a small town band trying to be heard in a world that won't listen to them.  It is also about best friends discovering what makes them ""a band"".  Then throw in a little conspiracy and that is what ""Josie and the Pussycats"" is.  The pacing of the film is fairly fast paced...but in a good way.  It does not feel rushed at all, but does keep constant motion.  But what really makes the film shine are the themes that it covers such as marketing, taking risks, and roots and identity.  However, what was especially wonderful was the relationship between the band members.  It's not often you find a film that chooses to capitalize and center the film around the Best-Friends-Forever kind of relationship.  And what's more, it's not often you find a film that does it well.  It's very touching and moving...how they each want to see the other succeed...and that serves as part of their drive to do music with each other.  There is some romance thrown in with Alan M., but that took 2nd place to the BFF nature of the film.***PSEUDO SPOILER (ONLY BECAUSE THIS IS A GIVEN IF THEY ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE COMICS AND THE SHOW)***In fact, even when Alan and Josie finally ""make it official"", it was portrayed not just as a joyous moment and victory not just for those two, but for the other Pussycats, as well.***END OF PSEUDO SPOILER***It's also so amusing how they poke fun at themselves with the fact that their source material is a comic book and cartoon show.  In the end, it is not the most groundbreaking plot...but still a solid and fairly well done one.CHARACTERS:Whereas the narrative is pretty simple and not too complexed, the character interaction is what makes the plot and film shine.  Though the characters were certainly ""modernized""  in the way they dress and speak for the sake of the film and connection with the millennial audience, the core of the characters are precise and to the point.  You can still very much see Josie as Josie, Valerie as Valerie, Melody as Meldoy, etc.  What's more, the entire signature cast of characters is there (besides the Pussycats there's Allan, Alexander, and Alexandra).  I loved the interactions they had with each other.  The only little quip I have is that I wish Alexander and Alexandra were given a little more screen time, and that Allan's folk music background was emphasized a bit more (though they did touch on it a few times throughout the film).  But all in all, the actors and actresses did their homework and were truly the embodiment of the characters.MUSIC:The film being so music-centric, of course one must pay some especial attention to the music.  I can simply say, the soundtrack is tons of fun and amazing...filled with wonderful pop punk rock pieces.  What's cool is that though they did hire another vocalist to be the singing voice of Josie, the actresses sang backup vocals for some of the songs.  And as to the ladies visually syncing to the songs in the film...they seriously put in a lot of work.  Their movements, strumming, and fills totally fit in with the music.  Even Josie's visual pronunciations looked natural.  Lyrically, it really fit with what the girls were going through.  And though the music was more punk'ish than the original cartoons, it still felt in character to the kinds of music the they would come up with.  I definitely would like to get the soundtrack sometime.ALL IN ALL...""Josie and the Pussycats"" was an enjoyable music adventure.  The Narrative was nothing new or complexed.  But it was solid, well-crafted, and well paced.  The characters really shine bringing a modern flair to classic personalities...and they do it brilliantly staying true to the originals.  And, of course the music is simply stunning.  This film may not be too serious (it is listed a comedy after all)...but it has tons of humor and meaningful moments that are heartwarming and encouraging.  And ultimately, it's just plain fun :-)",4,The Pussycats Still Stand the Test of Time After All These Years,1404777600,"07 8, 2014",2014,7100,"['Josie', 'Pussycats', 'are', 'one', 'most', 'iconic',

I'm sorry for breaking my new years resolution so soon.  I resolved that I would never again write a negative review on amazon, that I was always trashing everything and I was making people angry and that if I didn't like something I should shut up about it.  Then I saw Josie and the Pussycats.  I have never been more embarrassed for a bunch of actors.  I loved Charlie's Angles and thought this would be like that only with guitars, I was primed for some cool 70's retro music and some silly fun.  This movie was painful.  I have never seen worse acting, never.  If you watch you can see Parker Posie looking around as if she is waiting for the director to yell cut.  Someone should have.  The same tired old joke is rehashed countles times, that product placement is everywhere, Target logos inside the plane etc..  This was mildly funny once.  Once.  Rachel Leigh Cook is unsinkable.  She is so beautiful that she can make a film better simply by standing there, she is incapable of delivering a bad line no matter how poorly it is written, bravo Rachel, you poor brave girl.

I just found it fun to watch. Rachel Leigh Cooke, Rosario Dawson, and Tara Reid (Hilarious! &quot;I could be in this room - and in the bathroom - and in the closet&quot;) made completely lovable characters out of Josie, Val, and Mel. Alan Cummings and Parker Posey were great as our &quot;cartoonish&quot; villians. Parker Posey was hilarious and completely over the top, but it was great. There are plenty of cameos: Carson Daly, Aries Spears of MadTV, Seth Green, Breckin Meyer, and the Moviefone Man's Voice! Josie was all about pop culture and pop references. It's more like a spoof of the whole &quot;Teen takeover&quot; thing going on. The plot revolves around a sinister plan. The plan? &lt;Enter cartoonish villain music from movie&gt; A major underground corporation puts subliminal (right word?) messages in the backgrounds of CDs that sells stuff. A la, &quot;Pepsi One is the new Diet Coke&quot; and &quot;Orange is the new pink!&quot; and &quot;I want an Abercrombie tee.&quot; The organization is headed by Parkey Posey and Alan Cumming's characters, and they have signed Josie and co. as their new band, and their new lab rat. All that ensues in Josie and the Pussycats is good times, and learning how to hold onto friendship. The DVD has pretty good picture, and the sound is good. Especially during the songs. The supplements are good enough to satisfy any fan of the movie. To begin with, there's a 24 minute featurette explaining the whole movie, and has some great behind-the-scenes footage. There are 3 deleted scenes. The first two are entertaining, but the 3rd is just a tiny extended scene. Next up is the video for Three Small Words by Josie and the Pussycats, and 2 videos from the spoofed boy-band Du Jour (Which had Seth Green and Breckin Meyer in it). The Du Jour videos are hilarious spoofs of boy band videos. Rounding out the extras is the theatrical trailer and cast and crew bios. I did find one dissapointing thing. In Parker Posey's movie credits, they forgot to mention her role in Scream 3. That's what made me a fan of Parker. There is also a commentary from director and producer, but I didn't get to catch that. Although I'm pretty sure it was entertaining. In the end, Josie and the Pussycats is your average attempt at a fun movie. For some people, it doesn't work.

My excitement didn't last long!First let me say that the movie, on a visual level, is quite stunning.  It's flashy and shiny- it looks great. The editing is impeccable and extremely creative.  Parker Posey and Alan Cumming (both who seem to be quite reliable in each movie they appear in) have the best time with their respective parts (they are the villains.)  Josie And The Pussycats, on the other hand, are an entirely different matter.  Rachael Lee Cook really doesn't even resemble the cartoon Josie (Lauren Ambrose of &quot;Six Feet Under&quot;, &quot;Psycho Beach Party&quot;, and &quot;Can't Hardly Wait&quot; would have been a much better casting choice).  Rachael does here what she does in all of her movies- walks through all of her scenes with a bland seriousness.  She usually looks like she just smelled a fart.  She seems like she's trying to channel Winona Ryder, but even Winona knows her way around a comedy.  (Rachael, take note of that.)  Rosario Dawson doesn't seem to be aware that she's in a comedy.  Her appearance in the tedious &quot;Kids&quot; flick has permanently put a scowl on her face, apparently.  You're making a movie that comes from a comic book!  Have some fun with it ladies!  Tara Reid, who has never left any sort of lasting impression on me before, is the only one out of the trio that seems to be having a good time.  She obviously cracked open a Josie comic book and watched an episode or two of the cartoon.  She embodies Melody perfectly.The music is forgettable complaint pop.  It has sort of an unglossy, alternative edge to it (thanks to vocals from the former lead singer of Letters To Cleo- who I barely remember.  Didn't they have a song on the &quot;Melrose Place&quot; soundtrack?)- which would have been fine if the movie would have been made in the early to mid-90's when that sort of music was popular.  Perhaps the filmmakers were going for something a little different- to avoid a Britney Spears/Christina Aguilera-esque sort of sound.  However, that is the sort of music that is popular with a lot of the people that this movie was marketed to.  The vocals aren't quite screaming, but they aren't that melodic, and the tunes are all pretty unmemorable.The boy band Du Jour that appears in the movie are infinitely more entertaining than Josie And The Pussycats- check out their bonus videos on the DVD.  Babyface turns in an embarassing cameo.  Carson Daly's cameo is actually quite clever, as are all of the product placements that fit neatly into the storyline.  It's interesting to me that MTV barely gave this flick the time of day when it was released at the theaters, being that they are quite visible here.It's not a horrible movie- there are some good ideas here.  The execution is just marred by some ho-hum, unenthusiastic acting from two of the lead actresses.  It's pretty sad when the villains of a movie are what you look forward to seeing on screen.If you weren't alive when the original comic and cartoon were around you may think it's great.

The boy band is called Dujour, and they are surrounded by screaming fans. They arrive at the airport to leave for their next gig, but they find time to perform a song (Backdoor Lover) on the tarmac. We follow them onto their plane. The film is mostly played straight, but massively tongue-in-cheek. There is more product placement than you can imagine - the inside of Dujour's plane is plastered with Target logos, for example.Dujour is played brilliantly deadpan by actors who don't get full credit in the cast list - only Alex Martin is credited as Les. I recognised Seth Green (as Travis) but not the other two. All seems to be going well for Dujour until they happen to ask their manager Wyatt Frame (Alan Cummings, very sinister in tinted glasses) about a background track on their latest single. He disclaims all knowledge, but immediately leaves the plane with the pilot (in midair, by parachute). On landing, Wyatt makes a phone call: ""Looks like we need a new band"". He has landed just outside Riverdale, where The Pussycats live. Gosh, what a coincidence!We meet The Pussycats playing in a bowling alley. The lead singer and guitarist is Josie (Rachel Leigh Cook, with red hair for a change); the bass guitarist is Val (Rosario Dawson); the drummer is Melody (Tara Reid). Wyatt runs into The Pussycats (almost literally) - Paradise by the Dashboard Light is playing, I think it should have been Band on the Run - and signs them to Mega Records.Perhaps the only real flaw in this movie is the way that it tries so very hard to be arch. (Horrible thought: I wonder if they did that deliberately, given that the characters come from the Archie comics? Nah - that's too subtle for an American film) Most of the time it comes off well, but there are exceptions... Perhaps the weakest part is Fiona (Parker Posey) - the CEO of Mega Records - she tries hard, but fails; maybe another actress could have pulled it off, or maybe they needed a different scriptwriter.Josie and the Pussycats make a record, and we see it climb the charts - interestingly, we see four top 40 charts, but Josie comments that all this happened in a week (should someone tell them that the top 40 only comes out once a week?). One of the many fun things you can do with your remote is read the names of the other songs on the record charts - this is a movie where freeze-framing and reading the backgrounds is rather fun.Naturally, this being a teen movie, the teens catch on to what's going on (I'm not going to tell you the whole plot), and you can probably guess the rest...The best advice I can give you is not to think too hard about the movie, and enjoy it.",3,"Not exactly a masterpiece,but still an entertaining movie",1103846400,"12 24, 2004",2004,2737,"['movie', 'called', 'Josie', 'Pussycats', 'odd', 'boy', 'band', 'boy', 'band', 'called', 'Dujour', 'are', 'surrounded', 'screaming', 'fans', 'arrive', 'airport', 'leave', 'next', 'gig', 'find', 'time', 'perform', 'song', 'Backdoor', 'Lover', 'tarmac', 'follow', 'plane', 'film', 'mostly', 'played', 'straight', 'massively', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'more', 'product', 'placement', 'can', 'imagine', 'inside', 'Dujour', 'plane', 'plastered', 'Target', 'logos', 'example.Dujour', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'deadpan', 'actors', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'full', 'credit', 'cast', 'list', 'only', 'Alex', 'Martin', 'credited', 'Les', 'recognised', 'Seth', 'Green', 'Travis', 'not', 'other', 'two', 'be', 'going', 'well', 'Dujour', 'happen', 'ask', 'manager', 'Wyatt', 'Frame', 'Alan', 'Cummings', 'very', 'sinister', 'tinted', 'glasses', 'background', 'track', 'latest', 'single', 'knowledge', 'immediately', 'plane', 'pilot', 'midair', 'parachute', 'landing', 'Wyatt', 'phone', 'call', 'need', 'new', 'band', 'landed', 'just', 'outside', 'Riverdale', 'where', 'Pussycats', 'live', 'Gosh', 'what', 'coincidence', 'meet', 'Pussycats', 'playing', 'bowling', 'alley', 'lead', 'singer', 'guitarist', 'Josie', 'Rachel', 'Leigh', 'Cook', 'red', 'hair', 'change', 'bass', 'guitarist', 'Val', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'drummer', 'Melody', 'Tara', 'Reid', 'Wyatt', 'Pussycats', 'almost', 'literally', 'Paradise', 'Dashboard', 'Light', 'playing', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'Band', 'Run', 'signs', 'Mega', 'Records.Perhaps', 'only', 'real', 'flaw', 'movie', 'way', 'so', 'very', 'hard', 'be', 'arch', 'Horrible', 'thought', 'wonder', 'did', 'deliberately', 'given', 'characters', 'come', 'Archie', 'comics', 'Nah', 'too', 'subtle', 'American', 'film', 'Most', 'time', 'off', 'well', 'are', 'exceptions', 'Perhaps', 'weakest', 'part', 'Fiona', 'Parker', 'Posey', 'CEO', 'Mega', 'Records', 'hard', 'maybe', 'actress', 'could', 'have', 'pulled', 'off', 'maybe', 'needed', 'different', 'scriptwriter.Josie', 'Pussycats', 'make', 'record', 'see', 'charts', 'interestingly', 'see', 'four', 'top', '40', 'charts', 'Josie', 'comments', 'happened', 'week', 'should', 'someone', 'tell', 'top', '40', 'only', 'out', 'once', 'week', 'One', 'many', 'fun', 'things', 'can', 'do', 'remote', 'read', 'names', 'other', 'songs', 'record', 'movie', 'where', 'freeze-framing', 'reading', 'backgrounds', 'rather', 'fun.Naturally', 'being', 'teen', 'movie', 'teens', 'catch', 'what', 'going', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'tell', 'whole', 'plot', 'can', 'probably', 'guess', 'rest', 'best', 'advice', 'can', 'give', 'not', 'think', 'too', 'hard', 'movie', 'enjoy']",Josie and the Pussycats

665540,AQ2BC2TN40GG3,B00005MEVO,Matthew L. Mutchmore,"[2, 7]","As a lifelong fan of Josie and the Pussycats, and a collector of all things Josie related, I was somewhat apprehensive when I first heard about the movie being made. What would they be doing to the characters that I loved so much? My first glimpses were not exactly enough to relieve my apprehension. But I decided to keep an open mind. When the negative reviews came out, I decided to ignore them until I could see for myself. I waited until the DVD release to see the film. This movie has a lot of clever ideas, some inspired performances, a great visual style, some enjoyable songs and some funny gimmicks. I'm not exactly sure where it went wrong, but I think that the performance by Rachel Leigh Cook as Josie was not exactly &quot;compelling&quot;. I really didn't care about her in any way. The same goes for Rosario Dawson as Valerie. Tara Reid, who I usually don't care much for, did a great job as Melody. I don't think that she could have done any better. Was it the writing that created this problem? Probably not--Parker Posey and Alan Cumming were both fabulous as the villains of the film. Their parts seemed smartly written. Was it the pacing? Maybe--the plot moved pretty quickly, following the whirlwind rise of the band. Maybe I didn't get enough characterization. Was it the music? I don't think so--I enjoyed the music and thought it was at the very least appropriate for the sound of an all-girl smalltown band. I found myself tapping my toes along with the beat (and even singing some of the songs in the shower the next day). It might not be the sound of the moment (exemplified by the film's boy band DuJour) but I felt it fit perfectly with the band. I am glad that they left in the supporting cast, Alex and Alexandra Cabot and Alan M., but I would have enjoyed seeing more of them. They were an integral part of the original material. Should Sebastian the cat have appeared too? I think so, but I guess I can understand why they felt the need to exclude him. I think children would enjoy the film, getting into it's over-the-top product placement, color, and wacky fashion sense. Overall, I think this movie got some undue criticism.

This is an excellent movie that has probably been rarely seen by anyone over the age of 13 or not of the female gender. Yeah so its marketed to that demographic, that doesn't mean its not a qaulity movie. I would just like to proclaim proudly that I am a 20 year old male and I enjoy this movie to no end. I remember hearing ""3 Small Words"" on TRL when the movie came out and liked it. But, like most people who aren't 13 year old girls I thought ""I can't let anyone know that I like this"". I just forgot about it until I happen to see it on a movie channel. I watched it for about 20 minutes and thought ""this is actaully funny, smart, and entertaining."" It didn't hurt that I was a fan of Rachael Leigh Cook, either. Then I remembered hearing ""3 Small Words"" and just as I did the studio scene arrived and I heard them play it and thought ""there is no way I can live without this movie or soundtrack any longer."" So without seeing the whole movie I went out and purchased the DVD and the Soundtrack. Yes, I braved the strange looks of the cashiers and never looked back. Upon seeing the whole movie and hearing the whole soundtrack, I was hooked and proceeded to watch and listen to them incessantly. Rachael, Rosario, and Tara turn in great performances and Alan Cumming steals the show as Wyatt Frame. Breckin, Alex, Donald, and Seth are hilarious as the boy band DuJour and Parker Posie plays the perfect arch-villian Fiona.

They're gorgeous, they're talented, they're a little naive, and they can't seem to get a break in the record business! Little do they know that Wyatt Frame, the main man at Megarecords, is looking for a new act, and he just happens to be looking in Riverdale. After the tragic deaths of the members of his most recent pop sensation find, boy-band Du Jour, Wyatt is desperate to find a replacement. When he stumbles upon Josie and the girls crossing a busy street with their instruments in hand, he signs them immediately without hearing a single note of music from them. Suddenly, the newly dubbed ""Josie and the Pussycats"" are on a rollercoaster ride to fame and fortune, and within a week they have a number one song and a sold out concert on the horizon. But the girls don't know that the sinister music industry has been slipping subliminal messages under their tracks, using their music to sell everything from tennis shoes to Gatorade. When Valerie begins to catch on, Wyatt preoccupies her with the idea that Josie is hogging the spotlight, and when simple-minded Melody ALSO begins to get a bad feeling about things, Wyatt's boss, Fiona, decides the two trouble-making pussycats must be eliminated.Josie and the Pussycats is fun beyond belief. A perfect cast and a smart, funny script carry this movie to a level few comedies have been able to reach recently. The potty humor is to a minimum, focusing the laughs on quirky characters and a great plot about trends and product placement advertising. Despite what some reviewers might say, this live-action version of the famous cartoon band does an excellent job of staying true to the characters while updating them for a 21st century audience. The excessive product placement is meant to be a joke, not a huge ad. Anyone who says otherwise must have completely missed the point of the film, which is pretty sad since it was extremely clear and simple. A warning should be placed on the soundtrack to this movie though. The songs are great, with very sexy voices, but there is a LOT of sexual innuendo here and there. As for the perfect casting I mentioned before, Rachael Leigh Cook is gorgeous and talented as usual, a perfect choice, and definitely one of my top dream-girls. I only wish she had been cast as Sailor Mercury years ago in the live-action Sailor Moon movie that was almost made. Tara Ried and Rosario Dawson were excellent also. Though Tara's character, Melody, aside from being gorgeous, may also seem ridiculously stupid at times, this is only in keeping with the original cartoon character's personality, so God bless 'em for not changing her! Alexander and Alexandra were well cast as well, and really added some extremely funny moments to the film, as did the hilarious villains, Fiona and Wyatt. Alan M. was also nicely cast, though extremely scrawny in comparison to the original cartoon character, but that's the modern image of a hunk I suppose. Oh, and Du Jour, the boy band parody, was too, TOO funny! Great casting there too! Seth Green is always hilarious! All in all, this is simply an awesome movie! Definitely one of my all-time favorite films. As for DVD extras, there's a behind the scenes featurette, great deleted scenes, a hot little Pussycats video, two very funny Du Jour videos, and some other little niblettes. A warning though, for all the other guys like me who'd do just about anything for a date with Rachael Leigh Cook: Though the Backstage featurette will give you some adorable scenes of Rachael, including seeing her with beautiful, long, brown hair, and again later with hideous, chopped and bleached hair, ha, you will also have to suffer through her going on and on about how gorgeous the guy who plays Alan M. is.

With a variety of cute characters, bubblegum rock tracks and satire of commericialist pop music it is too cute to resist.  It follows a rock group, Josie And The Pussycats, on their way up to the top.  The only problem is that their music is being used to transport subliminal messages to the youth of America, dictating trends and fashions to them.  This is certainly a great idea and amusingly, each scene is filled with promotion for other products.  By far the best scene is at the start as hit boy band Du Jour (including Seth Green and Breckin Meyer) fight and bicker in an obvious satire of manufactured boy bands everywhere.Yes, so it's a one joke movie but it goes a long way on this one joke.  The actresses all look the part, especially the scatterbrained Tara Reid and record executive boss Parker Posey.  Whilst there are some unfortunate sidetracks into moral territory, with frienship and togetherness both getting in there, this rarely impinges on the light-hearted nature of the movie.

Overall, people who gave the movie a pass the first time around at the theatres will be pleasantly surprised by this fun movie which pokes a little fun at pop culture and music.THE MOVIE:The Story:Josie and the Pussycats (Rachel Leigh Cooke, Tara Reid and Rosario Dawson) are a garage rock band looking for their big break.  When a huge recording contract and overnight success comes to the girls suddenly they realize all is not as it seems as they uncover a huge media conspiracy.The Cool Stuff:It&#65533;s all about the story here.  All the observers, conspiracy theorists and pundits who talk about how much the media controls the youth of America has their movie right here!!  Overall, the movie&#65533;s a pretty brilliant comedy that touches upon issues such as these as well as simpler, but important, things such as remembering where you come from and who your friends are.  Some of the shots against current pop culture were pretty hilarious also (Boy Bands as well as the over abundance of consumerism) Bravo!!THE DVD:Again, like most DVD releases this DVD comes packed full of some great extras to enhance your viewing pleasure.  While not quite as packed as some other DVDs what you get here is a nice mix.  Among the goodies included here are:1. Commentary &#65533; always insightful2. &#65533;Backstage Pass&#65533; - 25 minute feature that talks about, among other things, the actresses relationships and chemistry and them learning to play together as a real band as well as their rock costumes.3. 3 Deleted Scenes4. 3 music videos:  &#65533;Three Small Words&#65533; by Josie and the Pussycats, &#65533;Backdoor Lover&#65533; by Dujour and &#65533;Dujour Around the World&#65533; by Dujour5. Trailers:  The theatrical and teaser trailer plus trailers for other movies.6. Production Notes &#65533; more insight into the movie7. Cast and Crew BiosTHE VERDICT:Overall this movie was just nice.  It may have passed most people&#65533;s radar the first time around but if you are looking for a nice rental for the weekend or evening this is your film.  The storytelling is very solid.  The story works on the deeper level as a story about friendship and pursuing your dreams.

With a great cast, a well written script, and good songs included, you cannot help but love this movie!The movie starts off with the boy band DuJour (imitating BSB, who were famous during the time this movie released), who discover something awkward behind the music in their CD and are made victims of a plane crash when their manager Wyatt Frame decides to get rid of them before they find out anything more. In search of a new band, Wyatt notices Josie McCoy, Melody Valentine and Valerie Brown of the group `The Pussycats', and instantaneously makes them famous so that the company's secret mission behind the music continues. Josie and her gang promise each other that they would be friends first and a group second. However, once they become popular, Josie's attitude changes, but will she realize her mistakes and bring peace in the end?This movie was hilarious from start to end. Rachel Leigh Cook, Rosario Dawson, and especially Tara Reid acted out their part well as the Pussycats. But the credit has to go to Alan Cumming and Parker Posey for doing such a fantastic job on their roles, and providing so much humor through the movie. Even Missi Pyle (who played Alexandra Cabot) was funny with her expressions. The storyline, even though it is senseless at times, is totally unique and kept my attention. Director Harry Elfont and Deborah Kaplan (who also directed the comical `Cant Hardly Wait') balanced out the comedy and romance in this movie and did a first-class job. And last but not the least, the catchy upbeat songs were a great change to listen to, and I'm sure I will be purchasing the soundtrack of this album in sometime.Even the DVD has some behind the scenes features and an audio commentary for the movie, to entertain us for a while.

665559,A2RN2AO4BE6F4K,B00005MEVO,"Scott Bright ""scottypotty""","[1, 6]","Movie Summary:  The Pussycats are a band that hasn't been having any luck. Until one day when a record producer who needs someone, anyone, to fill the shoes of the last band that he just had to kill, almost runs them over in his car. He quickly talks them into sighing a record deal without even hearing them. It takes Joise and the Pussycats quite a while to realize that something funny is going on. When they do, they end up in a fight for their musical careers as well as their lives.My Opinion: The only thing I found slightly interesting about this movie was the parallel that I dreamt up between Rachael Leigh Cook and her character in the movie. The fact that I had to dig so deep should tell you something. Anyway here it is. The movie is about a record company needing a star, any star regardless of talent. They took this nobody and pushed her on the youth of America with subliminal advertising and everyone believed she was good. I see the exact same thing in the movie. They needed an actress regardless of talent to fill Josie's shoes. She didn't need to be able to sing because that was dubbed in. She didn't need to be able to act because the movie was going to be a farce comedy anyway. They then put her in a glitzy movie and pushed her on the youth of America and told them it was good. Other than that, I didn't find anything redeeming or interesting about the movie. The product endorsement gag was played to death. It wasn't some brilliant master joke that no one gets. Well maybe for viewers of movies like Saving Silverman and Dude Where's My Car? it was pretty deep, but that's just sad for those of us who know better. And big deal there is a boy band parity. Wow what a surprise. How original to parity something from pop culture. It basically comes down to what you compare this movie to. If you compare it to some of the complete stinkers that have come out lately like Dude WMC? and Saving Silverman, then it might look pretty good. But if you compare it to an average comedy, then it's pretty sad stuff.DVD Quality: Video: Widescreen Anamorphic 1.85:1 Decent Video Quality  Sound: DD5.1  Extras:  Deleted scenes, Commentary, and Backstage PassWhat You Should Do:  Steer clear of this one unless you are in the mood for a teen comedy. It's not intelligent and it's not going to go over anyone's head. Tara Reid if fun to watch, but other than that there's not much to go on. There's nothing offensive and I can't remember any swearing so it would be okay for the kids to watch.Related Movies To Check Out or NOT: Saving Silverman, Dude Where's My Car",2,If You Have To Keep Asking &quot;Did You Get It&quot; It's Not Funny!,1001980800,"10 2, 2001",2001,2581,"['Movie', 'Summary', 'Pussycats', 'are', 'band', ""n't"", 'been', 'having', 'luck', 'one', 'day', 'when', 'record', 'producer', 'who', 'someone', 'anyone', 'fill', 'shoes', 'last', 'band', 'just', 'had', 'kill', 'almost', 'over', 'car', 'quickly', 'talks', 'sighing', 'record', 'deal', 'even', 'hearing', 'Joise', 'Pussycats', 'quite', 'while', 'realize', 'something', 'funny', 'going', 'When', 'do', 'end', 'up', 'fight', 'musical', 'careers', 'as', 'well', 'lives.My', 'Opinion', 'only', 'thing', 'found', 'slightly', 'interesting', 'movie', 'was', 'parallel', 'dreamt', 'up', 'Rachael', 'Leigh', 'Cook', 'character', 'movie', 'fact', 'had', 'dig', 'so', 'deep', 'should', 'tell', 'something', 'Anyway', 'here', 'movie', 'record', 'company', 'needing', 'star', 'star', 'regardless', 'talent', 'took', 'nobody', 'pushed', 'youth', 'America', 'subliminal', 'advertising', 'everyone', 'believed', 'was', 'good', 'see', 'exact', 'same', 'thing', 'movie', 'needed', 'actress', 'regardless', 'talent', 'fill', 'Josie', 'shoes', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'able', 'sing', 'was', 'dubbed', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'able', 'act', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'farce', 'comedy', 'anyway', 'then', 'put', 'glitzy', 'movie', 'pushed', 'youth', 'America', 'told', 'was', 'good', 'Other', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'anything', 'redeeming', 'interesting', 'movie', 'product', 'endorsement', 'gag', 'was', 'played', 'death', 'was', ""n't"", 'brilliant', 'master', 'joke', 'one', 'Well', 'maybe', 'viewers', 'movies', 'Saving', 'Silverman', 'Dude', 'Where', 'My', 'Car', 'was', 'pretty', 'deep', 'just', 'sad', 'who', 'know', 'better', 'big', 'deal', 'boy', 'band', 'parity', 'Wow', 'what', 'surprise', 'How', 'original', 'parity', 'something', 'pop', 'culture', 'basically', 'down', 'what', 'compare', 'movie', 'compare', 'complete', 'stinkers', 'have', 'come', 'out', 'lately', 'Dude', 'WMC', 'Saving', 'Silverman', 'then', 'might', 'look', 'pretty', 'good', 'compare', 'average', 'comedy', 'then', 'pretty', 'sad', 'stuff.DVD', 'Quality', 'Video', 'Widescreen', 'Anamorphic', '1.85:1', 'Decent', 'Video', 'Quality', 'Sound', 'DD5.1', 'Extras', 'Deleted', 'scenes', 'Commentary', 'Backstage', 'PassWhat', 'Should', 'Do', 'Steer', 'clear', 'one', 'are', 'mood', 'teen', 'comedy', 'not', 'intelligent', 'not', 'going', 'go', 'anyone', 'head', 'Tara', 'Reid', 'fun', 'watch', 'other', 'not', 'much', 'go', 'nothing', 'offensive', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'swearing', 'would', 'be', 'okay', 'kids', 'watch.Related', 'Movies', 'Check', 'Out', 'NOT', 'Saving', 'Silverman', 'Dude', 'Where', 'My', 'Car']",Josie and the Pussycats

I also couldn't stand the fact that every 10 minutes they found some other reason to sing another song.  Why?  This wasn't Josie and the Pussycats.  Josie and the Pussycats was like a female Scooby Doo.  They should have just dropped the Hanna Barbara license and just made a movie about a band trying to make it.
