The basic storyline about a kid who uses his savings to help someone find her future is kind of cute, but the details of the movie are cheesy be it the somewhat unrealistic photography angle, the gratuitous 1980s topless scenes or the obvious lip-synching of Demi Moore. There's just something about this movie that doesn't quite click for me, but it's still not too bad as far as old movies go.",2,Watchable but cheesy,1238889600,"04 5, 2009",2009,523,"['movie', 'very', 'dated', '80s', 'movies', 'still', 'play', 'well', 'one', 'suffer', 'little', 'more', 'time', 'others', 'basic', 'storyline', 'kid', 'who', 'savings', 'help', 'someone', 'find', 'future', 'kind', 'cute', 'details', 'movie', 'are', 'cheesy', 'be', 'somewhat', 'unrealistic', 'photography', 'angle', 'gratuitous', '1980s', 'topless', 'scenes', 'obvious', 'lip-synching', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'just', 'something', 'movie', ""n't"", 'quite', 'click', 'still', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'as', 'far', 'old', 'movies', 'go']",N/A

This movie was a major intro for him and he does a fine job portraying a teen that falls in love with an older woman. As he photographs the scenic city of San Francisco some people won't get out of his Ansel Adams type pictures. Lucky for him as one of them turns out to be the gorgeous young Demi Moore. When he meets her and finds out she has a husky singing voice he falls in love and ends up spending lots of money to make sure she becomes well known.

While it isn't going to be on anyone's best of all time lists, there are some very funny bits in this film which are clever and do not resort to stupidity.

He's true to his love of photography, tolerates his crazy family with wry humor, and follows his own path.  But when that path intersects with Demi Moore, his well-intentioned attempts to win her favor are classic.

821165,AM2PUFZ203257,B0002234QS,Scott R. Harding,"[3, 3]","This movie was extremely important to me as a young teenager:  the way Jon Cryer pulled off his everyman geekiness really spoke to me during a crucial time in my life.  His characterization of Charles Cummings, like so many John Cusack roles, lived on in my memory as proof positive that the underdog with the slight build could not only intelligently put off the bullies around him, but wind up with the hottest girl.This no-frills DVD is a welcome addition to my movie library.  It's a good transfer, and the film is every bit as good - perhaps better? - than I remember it from countless viewings on HBO.  Mr. Cryer may have gotten short shrift in the inevitable comparison with Matthew Broderick, but this film stacks up as well against ""Ferris Bueller"" in terms of geeky-cool any day.  Demi Moore is at her '80s best:  both demure and sexy, she's the perfect foil for Cummings' affections.  The soundtrack is killer, and there's an actual big sigh of relief at the lack of involved menu pages or special features.  What...you need a ""25th Anniversary Edition"" with interviews explaining the detailed plotlines, and what it all means?  Pfagh.
