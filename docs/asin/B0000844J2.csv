It was well done and a great story. An extra bonus was the fact that a hot hunky Jeff Bridges bares his bubble butt in a nice scene. He almost bares everything except for a sheet that covers his balls.,4,good movie with a naked Jeff Bridges,1376524800,"08 15, 2013",2013,315,"['thinly', 'veiled', 'movie', 'based', 'Kennedy', 'family', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'brother', 'slain', 'president', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'great', 'story', 'extra', 'bonus', 'was', 'fact', 'hot', 'hunky', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'bubble', 'butt', 'nice', 'scene', 'almost', 'everything', 'sheet', 'balls']",Winter Kills
733376,A2CZPM110DW516,B0000844J2,"Brian W. Fairbanks ""Brian W. Fairbanks""","[0, 0]","""Winter Kills"" is far less interesting than the story behind its production (which makes the bonus features on this 2 disc set very worthwhile), but William Richert's adaptation of Richard Condon's novel is worthy of the cult status it has enjoyed since its brief release more than two decades ago.In retrospect, ""Winter Kills"" almost looks like something of a warm-up for Oliver Stones' ""JFK,"" a more ambitious conspiracy thriller made 12 years later. Some of the dialogue in ""Winter Kills"" seems to have been revived, almost word-for-word, in Stone's film. But while ""JFK"" is more of an altar promoting Kennedy worship, ""Winter Kills"" is downright contemptuous of Camelot and of those who wield power in general.Jeff Bridges stars as the half brother of an assassinated United States president, obviously patterned on John F. Kennedy, who learns, via Richard Boone, that a second gunman was involved. Spurred on by his powerful king-maker father (John Huston), Bridges sets out to expose the conspiracy.""Winter Kills"" is an eccentrically entertaining ride with a cast that can only be described as a movie lover's dream.In addition to the always sincere Bridges and the unforgettable Huston, there's Sterling Hayden as a crazed war-mad defense contractor, and the magnificently larger-than-life Boone as a character who may or may not be worthy of the trust Bridges places in him. Ralph Meeker (the screen's best Mike Hammer), Toshiro Mifune, Eli Wallach, and even Elizabeth Taylor, all turn up in small but key roles, and there's Anthony Perkins as the head of the computer run information center that spies on Huston's enemies - and friends - while Perkins'wife, Berry Berenson, appears briefly as a morgue attendant. (She would later die in the terrorist attacks of 9/11.)Kennedy lovers condemned ""Winter Kills"" during its brief controversial theatrical release, and its doubtful they'll warm to it now, but for those who look with skepticism on politics regardless of party, or simply appreciate perverse cinema, ""Winter Kills"" is worth a look.Brian W.

At times the plot developments, such as they were, seemed so paranoid that the intended satirical effect gets buried.

733378,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B0000844J2,C. O. DeRiemer,"[2, 2]","This is an outstanding movie, full of brutal murder, conscienceless business dealings, hidden mikes and political prostitution. In other words, it's a great comedy of politics and power. It is probably one of the funniest, most paranoid black comedies yet made.On a tramp freighter a dying man confesses that he was the second shooter who assassinated, 19 years earlier, President Timothy Kegan. Kegan was a young, charismatic president who seemed to have a great future. On the ship, apparently by coincidence, is Nick Kegan (Jeff Bridges), who was the younger brother of the president. And, also perhaps by coincidence, the ship is part of the multi-billion dollar business empire owned by Nick's and Timothy's father, Pa Kegan, played by John Huston.Nick Kegan immediately heads for home to tell his father what he's learned. With his father's blessing, he sets out to find the truth about the assassination. During his investigation he encounters an aging, rich right-winger (Sterling Hayden) who likes to set up his own war games using his own tanks; a mob boss and killer (Ralph Meeker), a weird computer expert who seemingly has many of the answers on his tapes (Anthony Perkins), a knowing society hostess (Elizabeth Taylor), a sympathetic manservant (Torshiro Mifune), a hard-bitten clean-up man (Richard Boone) and so on. But don't let this list of eccentric cameos put you off. They all work very well. As Nick finds out more, people start to die...especially the people around him.The heart of the movie is Bridges. He brings naive trust to the role. All he wants is the truth; he doesn't want to hurt people. His tendency is to believe what they tell him. When he realizes death is following him, he doesn't know what to do about it. Gradually, he becomes determined to learn the truth wherever it might lead.And just as much a partner of Bridges in the success of the story is John Huston's turn as Pa Kegan. Kegan is simply in a class by himself. He's dynamic, utterly ruthless, cynical and completely charming. Some of the things he does are unbelievably amoral, but they're funny if you're willing to let your worse half take over.This is a movie worth having. I watch it every so often and enjoy it every time.The story of how the movie finally got made is almost as engrossing as the movie. It was financed by a couple of guys making money from soft porn and drugs. The money ran out a couple of times until they found more cash. Once the writer and director, William Richert, had to stop production entirely, make another move to earn cash, and then return to finish the last scenes. During all this, Bridges stayed with him. When the movie finally was released, the production company who had it put no money behind it, the movie disappeared without a trace, and was resurrected only three or four years ago when the DVD was made of it. And if you like the movie, I strongly recommend the book, Winter Kills, by Richard Condon. It's even better.The DVD looks and sounds fine. The three interviews with the director, cast and production crew are insightful, sad and funny. The only caveat I'd have is Huston's advice during the climax.

Richard Condon's dark comic source material is handled adequately by writer-director William Richert but a more assured hand could have really spiced up this Kennedy-esque conspiracy tale.  What makes the film worthwhile is the work of the veteran character actors on hand particularly Sterling Hayden and John Huston who chew the scenery in royal fashion.  Their performances demand the audience to take note of the material's twisted overtones but Richert, to a degree, undermines them.  Jeff Bridges, with his classic movie star looks but a character actors thought process, wisely defers to his older compatriots.

From watching it, it hardly seems worth the effort, but you have to admire his principles. If the story behind the making of the movie is fascinating, the movie itself has problems, not least of which is John Huston, a great director, not actor, playing the most important part. The plot is based on President Kennedy's assasination. The rumor was that Ted Kennedy had the distribution of the film curtailed because he was running for President at the time ""Winter Kills"" was finally released. If he did, he was misguided because the family depicted had little resemblance to the Kennedys, and trying to suppress the movie only gave it more credibility. I think at the time the film didn't meet audience expectations because the stars who were heavily advertised had small parts in the film.

It's a terrific black comedy about (GASP!) a presidential assassination that would make an interesting double-bill with Oliver Stone's ""JFK"". And like ""JFK"", the film is packed with cameo appearances by a stellar cast, with John Huston stealing every scene he's in as a randy, Joseph Kennedy, Sr.-type political patriarch. It's based on the novel of the same name by Richard Condon who also wrote ""The Manchurian Candidate,"" and, while not as complex as that novel or film, ""Winter Kills"" is a must-see for conspiracy buffs with a healthy appreciation for dark, irreverant humor. You'll be hooked through all of the twists and red herrings to the shocking final confrontation which concludes one of the most memorable images in screen history.The movie was plagued with production problems (even requiring a two-year hiatus to raise money to complete shooting), butchered by its original distributors, who then gave it an aborted theatrical release. In 1983, a VHS tape was released, recut to the director's concept with the original ending restored, and that is the version that appears on this DVD. The transfer is stunning and presented in it's original widescreen 2.35:1 aspect ratio and there's an interesting commentary by first-time feature director, William Richert who also adapted the novel for the screen.My only problem with this ""package"" is that its hour or so of extras could easily have fit on one side of one disc, but Anchor Bay has chosen to pad it into two, thus jacking up the price. ... And, frankly, I was expecting more from the featurette, ""Who Killed 'Winter Kills'?"" THAT fascinating story is crammed into the last ten minutes of this 38-minute mini-documentary and still leaves a lot of questions, none of which are answered in the other two extremely short (less then 10 minutes each) extras, which are just back-slapping, ""good-to-see-you-again"" empty memory trips. Yes, there are several still galleries, and the screenplay is on DVD-ROM, but, again, all of this could have fit on one disc.Anchor Bay should be congratulated for bringing this film to DVD, but chided for trying to bleed the consumer out of a few extra bucks. They're NOT The Criterion Collection and, in the future, they should take their cue from MGM who did such a spectaclar job on the Special Edition of ""The Usual Suspects"". The widescreen and pan&scan; versions of the film were on one side, hours of extras were on the reverse (See my review for the details.) and the price was more than reasonable, it was downright cheap for all you were given.So, at the expense of a great 5-STAR movie, I'm ""charging"" Anchor Bay two stars for being greedy and giving the package only three.",3,TERRIFIC FILM !

This was based on a story by Richard Condon who also wrote The Manchurian Candidiate. A great cast with a very young Jeff Bridges as the lead in this partially based on fact, darkest of comedies, paranoid controversy theoretical waking nightmare of a movie.Richard Boone, Sterling Hayden, Toshiro Mifune, Liz Taylor, JOHN HUSTON, Anthony Perkins, Ralph Meeker, Eli Wallach, Tomas Milian, many only get a scene or two, some only a scene, but they are all used for all the iconic power they are capable of generating. Not to mention exquisite cinematography by Vilmos Zsigmond and an astounding debut for director/actor/etc., William Richert. This film was way too early for it's time, and in the same way Welles' Citizen Kane stepped on the feet of a giant this film also played with the thinly veiled mythology of real people, in this case the Kennedys. The story of why this brilliant film was stillborn upon it's initial release is likely a story worthy of the intrigue and rampant angst that fuels this spectacular film itself; though it's only hinted at in the Who Killed Winter Kills documentary, (that helps to flesh out the second disc disc of this set).

733387,A3GLALCBHOR3T,B0000844J2,Harry Georgatos,"[0, 0]","WINTER KILLS wants to parallel the Kennedy assassination in a somewhat satirical manner. It fails to achieve the flight of imagination that Kubrick brought to DR STRANGELOVE. John Huston is channeling the evil nature of his character from CHINATOWN. Huston in WINTER KILLS does not have the detailed characterisation and the essence of evil that he portrayed in CHINATOWN. There are some inspired scenes such as the assassination of the victims in the car early on in the film that had a surreal sense in the manner that the three victims were assassinated, with Jeff Bridges the only surviving member. There weren't enough inspired scenes that would have lifted this film to cult status such as Dr STRANGELOVE. Elli Wallach has one of the best scenes in the film as he's recruited as a mechanic in the presidential assassination of Jeff Bridges brother to only realise he's in over his head. This film is a curiousity piece and deserves a few repeated viewings with cameo appearance from Sterling Hayden as a crazed tank driving General. Vilmos Zigmond widescreen photography is a stand-out. We have gangsters, assassins, government involvement, anti-Castro Cubans that parallel Kennedy's assassination. I wanted more disturbing scenes that needed to be more subversive in the telling of this story. At the end of the day the director didn't have the money he needed to make this film and probaly tell the story he wanted to tell. Part of the film was funded by orgainsed criminals and the one of the investors in this film was killed. There were scenes the director wanted to film but the budget wasn't there and had made a compromised film.

And second, I would never have discovered this movie had I not chanced upon it at the library ... and I'm baffled more people don't mention it. Huston's megalomaniacal Mr. Burns cum Palmer Eldritch cum Citizen Kane is diabolically delicious and the kind of character that should show up in one of the Hollywood retrospectives they show when a host is caught up snorting lines backstage during the Oscars. In fact, ""Winter Kills"" teems with offbeat characterizations that might flutter off into self-absorbed zaniness if not for Jeff Bridges in a competent everyman role. Perkins performs the kind of inspired cameo that makes you shake your head he couldn't have broken free of the ""Psycho"" mold. Sterling Hayden, interestingly, plays a character that could very well be the same power-mad general he played in ""Dr. Strangelove,"" retired now and protecting his land with tanks. And Liz Taylor is perfect in her split-second appearance as a sort of doughboy Heidi Fleiss, dolled up and glassy-eyed. Bridges, tempered amid the maelstrom and a smart, multilayered ""whodunit"" script keeps the film grounded.

This little seen film, barely released in 1979 after a torturous, much delayed production, received strong reviews and then disappeared.There was talk the Kennedy family didn't approve and put pressure on parent company Avco Embassy (which had military contract associations) to withdraw the film, Condon suggested in an article, ""Who Killed Winter Kills"" for Harper's magazine.  Whatever the case -- and the story behind the filming is certainly as interesting as the film story -- this marvelous, all-star thriller about the brother of a murdered president looking into the killing plays with the darkest, almost subconscious fears this country has collectively harbored about the death of JFK.The once in a lifetime cast includes: Jeff Bridges, John Huston, Sterling Hayden, Richard Boone, Elizabeth Taylor, Eli Wallach, Ralph Meeker, Toshiro Mifune and Belinda Bauer.  Plus a great score by Maurice Jarre (Lawrence of Arabia). Extras on this two-disc set (seems like it could've all fit easily on one disc) include a lively, sometimes startling, commentary from Richert and OK interviews with Bridges, Bauer, cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond and production designer Robert Boyle.
