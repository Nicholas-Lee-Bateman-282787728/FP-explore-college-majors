1354498,AH9K6PPVZKVY3,B003N0E5DW,Barbara (Burkowsky) Underwood,"[10, 12]","In recent years, audiences have thronged to both the stage musicals and motion pictures entitled Chicago, with stars like Richard Gere, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Renee Zellweger in the 2002 Oscar-winning film, and Ginger Rogers in the 1942 movie version entitled Roxie Hart.  All of these successful productions are based on the original stage play and subsequent first motion picture from 1927, which writer Maurine Dallas Watkins based on a real-life murder trial which she covered as a journalist for the Chicago Tribute in 1924.After 172 successful Broadway shows in 1926, the first film adaptation was made by the DeMille Production Company, and like most silent films attached to the name of Cecil B DeMille, it contains all the elements of a top-quality Hollywood production.  As such, however, a few changes from the original stage play were made to suit film audiences, resulting in a serious drama with light touches of humour.  An outstanding performance by Phyllis Haver in the lead role as Roxie Hart also greatly contributes to the effectiveness of the film.As a non-musical film adaptation, attention is directed at the main characters and the story of the infamous murder and trial.  The beautiful, blonde Roxie Hart, whose adoring husband is devoted to her, hides a dark double life which is exposed when she shoots her lover and kills him.  Claiming self-defense because she feared the thief and stranger who broke into her home would rape her, an all-male jury acquitted her of murder charges, but it is the way in which she manipulates her surroundings to her own benefit that is expertly conveyed in this film.Using her attractiveness and sex appeal, Roxie plays the sweet and innocent maiden to the hilt, with coaching from her lawyer to appeal to the sympathy of the jurors.  The feminine wiles she over-acts in these cases are humorous indeed, but not when the result in real life is an acquittal solely due to her appearance and behaviour in court.  The viewer is well aware of Roxie's true nature, her complete lack of conscience or remorse, and even her pleasure in flaunting herself and manipulating others.  Her main victim is Amos Hart, her husband, who stoops to stealing in order to pay for her legal fees, and stands by her throughout the trial despite his eyes having been opened to her true nature.Typifying superficial people obsessed with their attractiveness, Roxie is self-absorbed, feisty, money-hungry and opportunistic, and craves attention and publicity. Accomplished actress, Phyllis Haver had already appeared in nearly a hundred films, beginning her career ten years earlier as one of Mack Sennett's Bathing Beauties - the pedestal for other successful silent screen stars such as Mabel Normand and Gloria Swanson.  In contrast to the vibrant character of Roxie, Hungarian-born actor, Victor Varconi, is equally effective in his portrayal of the pathetic husband who silently observes his wife's charade.The use and abuse of journalism and sensationalism are also shown effectively in this superbly crafted silent film, visually expressing transparent motives, feelings and a great deal about human nature without much dialogue.  A poignant ending without words adds the finishing touch, and it is no surprise that Chicago was presented to a sellout house of 1,400 people at the San Francisco Silent Film Festival in 2006.",5,Exciting and not-to-be-missed 1920s crime drama!,1277251200,"06 23, 2010",2010,3367,"['recent', 'years', 'audiences', 'have', 'thronged', 'stage', 'musicals', 'motion', 'pictures', 'entitled', 'Chicago', 'stars', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', '2002', 'Oscar-winning', 'film', 'Ginger', 'Rogers', '1942', 'movie', 'version', 'entitled', 'Roxie', 'Hart', 'successful', 'productions', 'are', 'based', 'original', 'stage', 'play', 'subsequent', 'first', 'motion', 'picture', '1927', 'writer', 'Maurine', 'Dallas', 'Watkins', 'based', 'real-life', 'murder', 'trial', 'covered', 'journalist', 'Chicago', 'Tribute', '1924.After', '172', 'successful', 'Broadway', 'shows', '1926', 'first', 'film', 'adaptation', 'was', 'made', 'DeMille', 'Production', 'Company', 'most', 'silent', 'films', 'attached', 'name', 'Cecil', 'B', 'DeMille', 'elements', 'top-quality', 'Hollywood', 'production', 'such', 'however', 'few', 'changes', 'original', 'stage', 'play', 'were', 'made', 'suit', 'film', 'audiences', 'resulting', 'serious', 'drama', 'light', 'touches', 'humour', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'Phyllis', 'Haver', 'lead', 'role', 'Roxie', 'Hart', 'also', 'greatly', 'effectiveness', 'film.As', 'non-musical', 'film', 'adaptation', 'attention', 'directed', 'main', 'characters', 'story', 'infamous', 'murder', 'trial', 'beautiful', 'blonde', 'Roxie', 'Hart', 'adoring', 'husband', 'devoted', 'dark', 'double', 'life', 'exposed', 'when', 'shoots', 'lover', 'Claiming', 'self-defense', 'feared', 'thief', 'stranger', 'who', 'broke', 'home', 'would', 'rape', 'all-male', 'jury', 'acquitted', 'murder', 'charges', 'way', 'surroundings', 'own', 'benefit', 'expertly', 'conveyed', 'film.Using', 'attractiveness', 'sex', 'appeal', 'Roxie', 'sweet', 'innocent', 'maiden', 'hilt', 'coaching', 'lawyer', 'appeal', 'sympathy', 'jurors', 'feminine', 'cases', 'are', 'humorous', 'indeed', 'not', 'when', 'result', 'real', 'life', 'acquittal', 'solely', 'due', 'appearance', 'behaviour', 'court', 'viewer', 'well', 'aware', 'Roxie', 'true', 'nature', 'complete', 'lack', 'conscience', 'remorse', 'even', 'pleasure', 'flaunting', 'manipulating', 'others', 'main', 'victim', 'Amos', 'Hart', 'husband', 'who', 'stealing', 'order', 'pay', 'legal', 'fees', 'stands', 'trial', 'eyes', 'having', 'been', 'opened', 'true', 'nature.Typifying', 'superficial', 'people', 'obsessed', 'attractiveness', 'Roxie', 'self-absorbed', 'feisty', 'money-hungry', 'opportunistic', 'attention', 'publicity', 'Accomplished', 'actress', 'Phyllis', 'Haver', 'had', 'already', 'appeared', 'nearly', 'hundred', 'films', 'beginning', 'career', 'ten', 'years', 'earlier', 'one', 'Mack', 'Sennett', 'Bathing', 'Beauties', 'pedestal', 'other', 'successful', 'silent', 'screen', 'stars', 'such', 'Mabel', 'Normand', 'Gloria', 'Swanson', 'contrast', 'vibrant', 'character', 'Roxie', 'Hungarian-born', 'actor', 'Victor', 'Varconi', 'equally', 'effective', 'portrayal', 'pathetic', 'husband', 'who', 'silently', 'wife', 'charade.The', 'use', 'abuse', 'journalism', 'sensationalism', 'are', 'also', 'shown', 'effectively', 'superbly', 'crafted', 'silent', 'film', 'visually', 'expressing', 'transparent', 'motives', 'feelings', 'great', 'deal', 'human', 'nature', 'much', 'dialogue', 'poignant', 'ending', 'words', 'finishing', 'touch', 'surprise', 'Chicago', 'was', 'presented', 'sellout', 'house', '1,400', 'people', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Silent', 'Film', 'Festival', '2006']",N/A

Here, it's more a drama with some humorous scenes, released in 1927, just one year after the original play opened.  Although it's a silent film, it's probably the most visually authentic version, filmed as it was so close in time to the real events.  DeMille is not listed as the director but there are many 'DeMille touches' throughout, so can be assumed that he had much to do with making the film.  The black and white print has been beautifully cleaned up at the UCLA Film School.  The musical score (based on the original score) has been edited and recorded in modern sound, which adds immensely to the enjoyment.  In addition to the film, there are many extra features, including a short film with still photos of the real 'Roxie' telling the story that was the major inspiration for the 1926 play. There are also documentaries (made years later) about 'Flappers', the 'Roaring Twenties' and more. One note: The timing of the film is listed as 119 minutes but it is actually about 105 minutes in length. All-in-all a VERY enjoyable set.

1354500,A3M5UGU0NGD38D,B003N0E5DW,Casey62,"[3, 3]","CHICAGO (1927), is a tantalizingly entertaining film that offers us an accurate portrayal of the cynical view people had toward the law, trash journalism, and general moral standards during the 1920's. Phyllis Haver (in an engaging performance) stars as Roxie Hart, a sexy jazz baby who kills a former lover in her apartment and manages to beat the rap through crooked publicity and legal finagling.The film was produced by the legendary Cecil B. DeMille, and although the credited director is Frank Urson, there is substantial proof that DeMille directed much of it himself. DeMille is primarily known today as THE director of large scale epics, but during the teens and 20's his forte was films like CHICAGO - witty, sophisticated and erotically charged urban morality plays that were very popular with audiences.CHICAGO was based on the actual 1924 case of Mrs. Beulah Annan who shot to death Harry Kalstadt allegedly to ""save her honor"". During a widely publicized trial worthy of O.J. Simpson, the defense attorney won over the jury and Annan was acquitted. This lurid bit of history served as the basis for a 1926 Broadway hit as well as for the famous 2002 musical also entitled CHICAGO. In 1942 Ginger Rogers starred in another film version called ROXIE HART, which is pretty good itself.Two fine documentaries serve as DVD extras: THE GOLDEN TWENTIES (1950) and THE FLAPPER STORY (1985).Flicker Alley is to be praised for giving us a spectacular version of this film, mastered directly from DeMille's own original nitrate print which looks immaculate.

1354501,A3QIW6ULPIPM2V,B003N0E5DW,Chip Kaufmann,"[7, 7]","""Those who forget History are condemned to repeat it"" is the famous quote and perhaps that explains the current movie climate where remakes predominate. As we continue to evolve into a culture of short term gratification and long term memory loss, it's important to rediscover forgotten parts of our cinematic history especially when it's presented in such a way as this. David Shepard and Flicker Alley are to be congratulated yet again for their fine work in bringing to us another film previously thought to be lost.For those of you not familiar with the award winning Broadway musical or 2002 film version, CHICAGO is based on a 1926 play which tells the story of the trial of Roxie Hart, an adulterous wife who shot her lover after he tried to ditch her. The play isn't about the verdict but how the trial is used to promote almost everyone involved except the long suffering husband. Although played for all its melodramatic possibilities with elements of humor, it sadly shows us that little has changed in 80 years when it comes to sensationalistic journalism.The film rights were quickly snapped up by Cecil B. De Mille who had his own movie company at this time. It's essentially his movie all the way but he allowed Frank Urson (an assistant director) to take credit because of De Mille's involvement with THE KING OF KINGS which was already in theaters. Phyllis Haver gives a wonderfully manic and comic performance as Roxie Hart while Victor Varconi excels as the betrayed husband, Amos Hart and yes that's gravelly voiced Eugene Pallette minus his voice and later girth as the murdered lover. The print looks as if it were processed yesterday and Rodney Sauer's score is up to his usual fine standards.

The restoration and recording to disk achieves near-perfect production values. It is unlikely that any of the original audience in 1927 saw a better version. The result is that this copy is also quite expensive, nearly $40.The bulk of this money reflects the technical achievement. The movie while good is not truly a lost classic. Yes it is a good movie, yes I recommend you watch this and never mind the cost, but there are better movies to be had. Mostly I wanted this version of Chicago as a completer for the different versions now available. I am happy with my purchase. I will not oversell it.My assumption is that you have come looking for this movie having read about the Maurine Watkins reporting of the original true story or more likely having watched either of the two later movies. Therefore I will not do a plot outline.In this version, Roxie (Phyllis Haver) is guilty of murder. In fact we see her shoot her now ex-lover Rodney Casely as he has already closed her apartment door and is on his way out. For all her loveliness this Roxie is not a nice person. Her contribution to the comedy grows from her mix of flirtatious manipulation and obvious pleasure in being the center of so much attention. In this version the husband Amos (Victor Marconi) is not the invisible dupe he will become in the later movies. That he will resort to theft to pay for the lawyer provides a major inconsistency given his final rejection of Roxie. Lawyer Billy Flynn (Robert Edeson) nearly takes over this movie and is portrayed as more of a deliberate villain than a shyster lawyer.I have not been able to determine if the musical score that accompanies this disk is original music written for the silent film or something that was written for this restoration. In either case the soundtrack is very good. They were scenes wherein musical accompaniment was distracting but I suspect it was more traditional to have a musical performance accompany the entire silent movie. Whatever the source of the score it does enhance the viewing experience.Bottom line: my purpose was to complete my collection. This version of Chicago satisfies my purpose but is unlikely to be worn out from replay.

This is the film that was based on the 1926 play of the same name and THAT was on a book (by Maurine Watkins). And this film formed the basis for the Broadway show, and later the Oscar winning film by the same name. (and there was also the non-musical film ""Roxy Hart"").The 1927 film was considered lost but a near-pristine copy was found in Director Cecil B. DeMille's private collection and the folks at UCLA did some restoration and transfer. Apparently it has been shown at festivals but never released on home video.To say that the print is gorgeous is an understatement! The blacks are sharp black and the whites are sharp too. (And this is on the same TV where the new ""A Star is Born"" restoration wasn't so sharp.) Phyllis Haver is Roxy and she is great! Sexy, cute and lethal with a gun. The pre-code sexuality is highly entertaining and the new score is perfect - with great sound effects too! I couldn't take my eyes off the screen.The film is being released in a 2-DVD package (with great graphics and a 26 page book of notes and photos). The first disc has the film as well as photo gallery.  Plus a short documentary about the woman upon who the Hart character was based. The second disc has a brief column documentary from the 1980s titled ""Flapper Girl"" in which filmmaker Lauren Lazin interviews five women who were ""flappers"" in the 20s. and a compilation from the March of Time series titled ""The Golden Twenties"", which is fun to watch. The print of the former is somewhat worn - but still watchable - while the March of Time one is, again, in beautiful condition.All these bonuses - and is some CD-ROM material on one disc as well - are, of course, icing on the cake. The real reason to see this is for the feature film! You'll watch it a second time just to catch Haver in action!Jeff Masino and David Shepard (the Flicker alley owners) have done great reissues in the past.
