651524,A39OUDNT8FWK32,B00005JPI6,aaron-the-baron,"[4, 4]","Aaron Sorkin's evolvement is evident in ""Studio 60."" I miss this show already; even when I watch the old episodes on my DVR, I am left feeling a little sad knowing that it is not coming back next season. It's a crime. Certainly a show that regularly delivered 8+million viewers until it became evident of its cancellation (6.5+ million for most of the burn-off episodes, plus a million or more on DVR-delay) should still have a place on TV, at least on Showtime or HBO. I know it was expensive, but HBO spent almost as much on ""The Sopranos"" in the later years, and ""S60"" was comparable in viewership. Personally, I absolutely disliked ""The Sopranos"" and everything it represented, but ""Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip"" almost always inspired and entertained me. It's all relative: TNT claims a huge success with ""The Closer,"" which delivers about as many viewers as ""S60"" did. And ""S60"" floors it in The Demo (18-49), as well as the Super Demo (wealthy 18-49). As a member of the rare ""religious middle (toward left)"" I found the battles between Matt and Harriet compelling, and the acting, writing, and chemistry were all first-rate. I do appreciate NBC for at least having the sense to run the last few episodes during the summer. Funny though, NBC switched the order of the episodes for the burn-off, running ""The Disaster Show"" first instead of ""Breaking News."" TDS, missing any appearances by Matt, Danny, or Jordan (Perry, Whitford and Peet), was the worst episode of the series, and after watching it I almost bailed on the rest of the episodes. I sure am glad I didn't do that. The remaining episodes were compelling, sticking with more drama and fewer sketches. The show wasn't perfect, but neither is life. It was heavy-handed at times, and a little melodramatic in spots, too. But it was great TV, some of the best in ages. I eagerly await the DVDs, but wonder why it won't be available in HD-DVD or blu-ray.Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip - The Complete Series",5,"'S60' rules, but why not on HD DVD?",1187136000,"08 15, 2007",2007,1969,"['Aaron', 'Sorkin', 'evolvement', 'evident', 'Studio', '60', 'miss', 'show', 'already', 'even', 'when', 'watch', 'old', 'episodes', 'DVR', 'am', 'left', 'feeling', 'little', 'sad', 'knowing', 'not', 'coming', 'back', 'next', 'season', 'crime', 'Certainly', 'show', 'regularly', 'delivered', '8+million', 'viewers', 'became', 'evident', 'cancellation', '6.5+', 'million', 'most', 'burn-off', 'episodes', 'million', 'more', 'DVR-delay', 'should', 'still', 'have', 'place', 'TV', 'least', 'Showtime', 'HBO', 'know', 'was', 'expensive', 'HBO', 'spent', 'almost', 'as', 'much', 'Sopranos', 'later', 'years', 'S60', 'was', 'comparable', 'viewership', 'Personally', 'absolutely', 'disliked', 'Sopranos', 'everything', 'represented', 'Studio', '60', 'Sunset', 'Strip', 'almost', 'always', 'inspired', 'entertained', 'relative', 'TNT', 'huge', 'success', 'Closer', 'many', 'viewers', 'S60', 'did', 'S60', 'floors', 'Demo', '18-49', 'as', 'well', 'Super', 'Demo', 'wealthy', '18-49', 'member', 'rare', 'religious', 'middle', 'left', 'found', 'battles', 'Matt', 'Harriet', 'compelling', 'acting', 'writing', 'chemistry', 'were', 'first-rate', 'do', 'appreciate', 'NBC', 'least', 'having', 'sense', 'run', 'last', 'few', 'episodes', 'summer', 'Funny', 'NBC', 'switched', 'order', 'episodes', 'burn-off', 'running', 'Disaster', 'Show', 'first', 'instead', 'Breaking', 'News', 'TDS', 'missing', 'appearances', 'Matt', 'Danny', 'Jordan', 'Perry', 'Whitford', 'Peet', 'was', 'worst', 'episode', 'series', 'watching', 'almost', 'bailed', 'rest', 'episodes', 'sure', 'am', 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'remaining', 'episodes', 'were', 'compelling', 'sticking', 'more', 'drama', 'fewer', 'sketches', 'show', 'was', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'life', 'was', 'heavy-handed', 'times', 'little', 'melodramatic', 'spots', 'too', 'was', 'great', 'TV', 'best', 'ages', 'eagerly', 'await', 'DVDs', 'wonder', 'why', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'available', 'HD-DVD', 'blu-ray.Studio', '60', 'Sunset', 'Strip', 'Complete', 'Series']",Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip - The Complete Series
651525,A30O8BV3UG5YTO,B00005JPI6,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","First off, perspective, I'm a died in the wool cord cutter.Not desperate to find material to watch, but anytime I can get a major &#34;chunk o time&#34; to watch something without putting a lot of thought into it.  (bad thing about cable cutting, you're stuck being your own &#34;video jockey&#34;, so a good series is a good thing.).That said, this was apparently put together by Aaron Sorkin (American President, West Wing, Newsroom (ongoing series, well worth watching).  Like Kevin Smith, it would seem there's a cadre of actors that follow along for a lot of his efforts.  It helps that they are an enjoyable crew and can execute dialogue well.In this case, think a backstage look at &#34;Saturday Night Live&#34;, which they give a respectful to several times over the course of the series. Also, a nod given to the old movie &#34;Network&#34;, which is used as another part of the basic premise.Premise?  Well, for reasons that would act as a spoiler, Matt and Danny, walk off / get fired from a Saturday Night Live type show.  Years later, it's falling apart and Judd Hirsch as Wes gets &#34;Mad as h*ll and won't take it anymore&#34;, from there Matt and Danny come on board to try and right the sinking ship.There are a lot of themes that are similar across all of Mr. Sorkin's offerings.-  A small enclosed society, being assaulted by a highly sensitive outside world (one of the big plot things in all of these is characters doing something inappropriate and having to fight the battle on whether to apologize or not.).-  Comedy, goodly amounts of that, a lot of it works (between the different cast members)-  Ties into events of the world current to the show itself;  Iraq War, Flooding of New Orleans, kidnapped soldiers.  They work, but I can see an issue with this whole thing down the road.  Who's going to remember the tie-in?  The cast, nod accordingly, and the writers for the most part assume that the viewer is going to figure it out.-  Uses industry insider knowledge, terms, processes, things that people as part of the show know what is going on, in many cases it isn't explained to the viewer (dropped .2 points for that)-  Comedy, bearable amounts, that don't really work all that well (thus the dropping of .5 stars), which is the actual comedy routines of the show itself.-  All of the characters are damaged goods, and a few of them have alcohol and drug issues.  (works pretty well)-  Character relationships, A man driven by his love for a woman to succeed, but so confused by her that one day they're together and the next not? (how unrealistic is that (sarcasm))Final .3 points deduction, the main female lead is a devout Christian, but tolerates all sorts of sniping at her religious beliefs in skits and such.  Matt, one of the main male leads, doesn't &#34;get&#34; the whole faith thing, their interaction detracts from the overall flow of the series.  BUT, is extremely critical to the plot progression.One thing I have heard is that the humor is extremely sharp, snide and critical...Well, that is true for some of the characters, but really that's a starting place, as the series progresses and you get under the skin of the characters and what drives them and how they develop, it seems to me that they mellow out fairly well.Of course, I have been criticized for being overly cynical and sarcastic, so there's that.End of the day, it's a complete package including an almost satisfying ending.  To me extremely watchable / rewatchable.If you've seen West Wing, you'll see a couple of episodes that are like &#34;I'll take that idea and respin it for TV&#34;, but they work.Highly recommended and if you get a chance check out Newsroom, another good series.",4,"Rewatchable, enjoyable, slightly flawed, but most things are",1372982400,"07 5, 2013",2013,3700,"['First', 'off', 'perspective', ""'m"", 'died', 'wool', 'cord', 'cutter.Not', 'desperate', 'find', 'material', 'watch', 'anytime', 'can', 'get', 'major', '34', 'chunk', 'time', '34', 'watch', 'something', 'putting', 'lot', 'thought', 'bad', 'thing', 'cable', 'cutting', ""'re"", 'stuck', 'being', 'own', '34', 'video', 'jockey', '34', 'good', 'series', 'good', 'thing', 'said', 'was', 'apparently', 'put', 'together', 'Aaron', 'Sorkin', 'American', 'President', 'West', 'Wing', 'Newsroom', 'ongoing', 'series', 'well', 'watching', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'would', 'seem', 'cadre', 'actors', 'follow', 'along', 'lot', 'efforts', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'crew', 'can', 'execute', 'dialogue', 'well.In', 'case', 'think', 'backstage', 'look', '34', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', '34', 'give', 'respectful', 'several', 'times', 'course', 'series', 'Also', 'nod', 'given', 'old', 'movie', '34', 'Network', '34', 'used', 'part', 'basic', 'premise.Premise', 'Well', 'reasons', 'would', 'act', 'spoiler', 'Matt', 'Danny', 'walk', '/', 'get', 'fired', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'type', 'show', 'Years', 'later', 'falling', 'apart', 'Judd', 'Hirsch', 'Wes', '34', 'Mad', 'h*ll', 'wo', ""n't"", 'take', 'anymore', '34', 'Matt', 'Danny', 'come', 'board', 'try', 'right', 'sinking', 'are', 'lot', 'themes', 'are', 'similar', 'Mr.', 'Sorkin', 'offerings.-', 'A', 'small', 'enclosed', 'society', 'being', 'assaulted', 'highly', 'sensitive', 'outside', 'world', 'one', 'big', 'plot', 'things', 'characters', 'doing', 'something', 'inappropriate', 'having', 'fight', 'battle', 'apologize', 'not', '.-', 'Comedy', 'goodly', 'amounts', 'lot', 'different', 'cast', 'members', 'Ties', 'events', 'world', 'current', 'show', 'Iraq', 'War', 'Flooding', 'New', 'Orleans', 'kidnapped', 'soldiers', 'work', 'can', 'see', 'issue', 'whole', 'thing', 'down', 'road', 'Who', 'going', 'remember', 'tie-in', 'cast', 'nod', 'accordingly', 'writers', 'most', 'part', 'assume', 'viewer', 'going', 'figure', 'out.-', 'Uses', 'industry', 'insider', 'knowledge', 'terms', 'processes', 'things', 'people', 'part', 'show', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'many', 'cases', ""n't"", 'explained', 'viewer', 'dropped', '.2', 'points', 'Comedy', 'bearable', 'amounts', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'work', 'well', 'thus', 'dropping', '.5', 'stars', 'actual', 'comedy', 'routines', 'show', 'itself.-', 'All', 'characters', 'are', 'damaged', 'goods', 'few', 'have', 'alcohol', 'drug', 'issues', 'pretty', 'well', 'Character', 'relationships', 'A', 'man', 'driven', 'love', 'woman', 'succeed', 'so', 'confused', 'one', 'day', ""'re"", 'together', 'next', 'not', 'how', 'unrealistic', 'sarcasm', 'Final', '.3', 'points', 'deduction', 'main', 'female', 'lead', 'devout', 'Christian', 'sorts', 'sniping', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'skits', 'such', 'Matt', 'one', 'main', 'male', 'leads', ""n't"", '34', 'get', '34', 'whole', 'faith', 'thing', 'interaction', 'detracts', 'overall', 'flow', 'series', 'BUT', 'extremely', 'critical', 'plot', 'thing', 'have', 'heard', 'humor', 'extremely', 'sharp', 'snide', 'critical', 'Well', 'true', 'characters', 'really', 'starting', 'place', 'series', 'get', 'skin', 'characters', 'what', 'how', 'develop', 'mellow', 'out', 'fairly', 'well.Of', 'course', 'have', 'been', 'criticized', 'being', 'overly', 'cynical', 'sarcastic', 'that.End', 'day', 'complete', 'package', 'including', 'almost', 'satisfying', 'ending', 'extremely', 'watchable', '/', 'rewatchable.If', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'West', 'Wing', ""'ll"", 'see', 'couple', 'episodes', 'are', '34', ""'ll"", 'take', 'idea', 'respin', 'TV', '34', 'work.Highly', 'recommended', 'get', 'chance', 'check', 'Newsroom', 'good', 'series']",Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip - The Complete Series
651526,A2Q3KZR7ZC1Q4T,B00005JPI6,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","My only 2 problems with this series were 1) it was canceled way too soon, and 2) the streaming by Amazon is annoying:  it catches, sometimes once or twice a sentence, for several minutes, or the video will freeze while the audio continues.  I've tried emptying the cache and this does nothing.  This is an Amazon problem that I've encountered on several of their instant videos, so it's not a problem with this series, but it's particularly annoying as this series showcases Aaron Sorkin at his word-drunk best.  I think the reason this series, which Mr. Sorkin created after the West Wing, didn't catch on was that, compared to the sweeping issues raised by a show set in the White House, the problems of a group of comics putting on a sketch comedy show didn't have the same sense of urgency.  Watching it again, though, I'm really impressed both by the casting and the acting choices--Ed Asner has a very assured turn as an urbane media mogul, whose multiple companies INCLUDE a network; Steven Webber really struck me as the head of the network--he doesn't try to make his character likable at all, so when the plot shows him to have his own sense of integrity and commitment to both the people working for him and those he works for, it's completely disarming. Finally, Mark McKinney, of Kids in the Hall fame, who also served this series as Story Editor and wrote 3 episodes, really startled me in a three episode arc as a comedy writer with a personal tragedy in his background-- an almost affect-less performance of a good guy who's emotionally burned out.  Nothing from KITH prepares you for this beautiful pencil sketch of a role.  I could go on about the leads, but then I'd just be gushing.

Where 30 Rock is comedy all the way, Studio 60 is a drama-an Aaron Sorkin/Thomas Schlamme masterpiece. If you loved The"" West Wing"" and enjoy ""Saturday Night Live"" somewhere along the line, then I have no doubt that you will appreciate the brillance of Studio 60. I love how each episode unfolds and as with The West Wing I suggest that you watch the episodes in air date sequence. The cast is fantastic: Matthew Perry (""Friends"" doesn't show case his drauma chops) is wonderful and he and Bradley Whitford play brilliantly against each other's characters. I love the Sorkin/Schlamme character development. How can you miss? Amanda Peet, Steven Weber, D.L. Hughley, Timothy Busfield-if you enjoyed any of their work in television or film before or after the one season of Studio 60 you will appreciate this gem as well. Hardly a one hit wonder. If you are a Hawaii 5 O/Alex O'Loughlin fan check out ""Moonlight"" the precusor to all the vampire series so popular as of 2012. Moonlight had a 16 episode run after falling victim to the Writer's Strike that year and went on to win the People's Choice Award for Favorite New TV Drauma. ""Underworld"" fans will recognize Sophia Myles. Don't let a one season run scare you off. I watch both Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip and Moonlight once a year.

I couldn't help suspecting the show lasted only one season because it bit too close to the bone for television.Bradley Whitford, Bartlett's deputy chief of staff on ""The West Wing,"" plays Danny Tripp, Studio 60's producer. He is teamed with Matthew Perry as Matt Albie, the show's chief comedy writer (and possibly Aaron Sorkin's alter ego). Allison Janney, Bartlett's press secretary and ultimately chief of staff, appears in one segment as herself and the week's host for ""Studio 60.""The tension of being funny every Friday night is no less gripping than, say, 500 well-armed Haitian troops invading the U.S. Embassy in Port au Prince. Politics enters into the plot almost exclusively in nonstop conflict with television industry censors. Romance is the main plot-turner here. Matt Albie has a conflict-riddled on-again, off-again love affair with one of his stars, comedienne Harriet Hayes, played by Sarah Paulson. He also has a drug problem. And Danny Tripp (spoiler alert!) falls reluctantly in love with the network boss, Jordan McDeere, played by Amanda Peet.I was sorry to reach the end of the last disk.",5,"For fans of ""The West Wing""",1255737600,"10 17, 2009",2009,1411,"['fans', 'West', 'WingIf', ""'ve"", 'been', 'wishing', 'Jeff', 'Bartlett', 'could', 'run', 'third', 'term', 'check', 'Studio', '60', 'Sunset', 'Strip', 'Aaron', 'Sorkin', 'creator', 'West', 'Wing', 'also', 'responsible', 'one-season', 'series', 'life', 'backstage', 'West', 'Coast', 'competitor', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'suspecting', 'show', 'lasted', 'only', 'one', 'season', 'bit', 'too', 'close', 'bone', 'television.Bradley', 'Whitford', 'Bartlett', 'deputy', 'chief', 'staff', 'West', 'Wing', 'Danny', 'Tripp', 'Studio', '60', 'producer', 'teamed', 'Matthew', 'Perry', 'Matt', 'Albie', 'show', 'chief', 'comedy', 'writer', 'possibly', 'Aaron', 'Sorkin', 'alter', 'ego', 'Allison', 'Janney', 'Bartlett', 'press', 'secretary', 'ultimately', 'chief', 'staff', 'one', 'segment', 'herself', 'week', 'host', 'Studio', '60', 'tension', 'being', 'funny', 'Friday', 'night', 'less', 'gripping', 'say', '500', 'well-armed', 'Haitian', 'troops', 'invading', 'U.S.', 'Embassy', 'Port', 'au', 'Prince', 'Politics', 'enters', 'plot', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'nonstop', 'conflict', 'television', 'industry', 'censors', 'Romance', 'main', 'plot-turner', 'here', 'Matt', 'Albie', 'conflict-riddled', 'on-again', 'off-again', 'love', 'affair', 'one', 'stars', 'comedienne', 'Harriet', 'Hayes', 'played', 'Sarah', 'Paulson', 'also', 'drug', 'problem', 'Danny', 'Tripp', 'spoiler', 'alert', 'reluctantly', 'love', 'network', 'boss', 'Jordan', 'McDeere', 'played', 'Amanda', 'Peet.I', 'was', 'sorry', 'reach', 'end', 'last', 'disk']",Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip - The Complete Series

Matthew Perry was the only ""friend"" that I thought was really funny, and I was a fan of Sorkin's work (more on Sports Nite -- I thought the West Wing was a little overrated).  This show never really clicked for me, especially when I compared it to NBC's other new dramas Heroes and Friday Night Lights which were much better shows.The show had two major flaws for me.  First, it was supposed to be a comedy sketch show that they were producing but the sketches were awful -- like 1980 or 1986 SNL awful.  I had a hard time believing that Matt's character was the comedic genius that he was supposed to be.Second, it was incredibly condescending to those Americans who choose not to live on one of the coasts, even when it was trying to show both sides.  The best example for me is when the one actors' (I can't remember his name) parents were visiting from their ""rural"" home -- in Columbus, Ohio!  Excuse me? Rural?  Do you have an atlas? Anyway, while he was giving them a tour of their theatre he mentioned that it was where Abbott & Costello premiered their ""Whose on First?"" sketch and the parents stared at him blankly and said that he was ""assuming we knew who that was"".  Ridiculous!  Not only has probably every Bushman in the Khalahari heard that sketch since he was a five-year-old; Abbott and Costello were the parents' generation!  They're from Ohio, not a cave!

Oliver,"[3, 3]","Ask any screenwriter, screenwriting guru, or person who is interested in real storytelling, and they'll tell you that the real entertainment of the twenty-first century is in television, Cable mostly, but occasionally a show on Primetime comes along, or a show on basic cable comes along, and the dialogue cracks off the screen, the show erupts with humor, drama, love, romance, (occasionally violence and sex though not in this show--and that's a brilliant plus in this show), and draws you into a well created story that wraps you into the characters, their lives, their love, and their humanitiy.  It's humanity that runs through the undercurrents of this brilliant show that could've offered us years of stories, but cut down in favor of the lobotimized 30 Rock (which had lower ratings and lower critical acclaim than Studio 60) because 30 Rock was cheaper--the irony for anyone who watches the first five minutes should be aware.This show, though several subplots are left open--they don't feel as if they're unfinished--ends very well, with almost all character archs for the series comfortably ended (capable of more development, but no cliff hangers).  It's a genius series, Aaron Sorkin's brilliant dialogue, quick witted ideas, and well crafted characters shows an innate genius for atmosphere, story, and especially dialogue.  This is nothing like The West Wing, and again that's a good thing (though The West Wing is brilliant and people who enjoy this will enjoy The West Wing, and vice-versa).If you love television, if you love quick witted educated dialogue and stories that don't treat the viewer like a moron, but doesn't complicate (though occasionally makes complex) or attempt to be arty or esoteric or surreal.  It just makes realistic, entertaining characters, that wrap you into their stories, and bring you into their lives.  This show plays like a 900+ minute movie, that's what it feels like to me, something you want to sit down and just watch and watch and watch in one or two days.

651557,A16U73T0WDHZDM,B00005JPI6,CQC,"[13, 35]","I am a big fan of most of Aaron Sorkin's work -- Sports Night, The West Wing, A Few Good Men (not so much a fan of The American President, which I felt was almost a trial story arc for The West Wing). That being said, I wish I could be as big a fan of Studio 60. It has great characters and compelling conflicts between them, which are key for any drama. However, I feel Studio 60 falls short on two fronts:1) It tries to be too important. The pilot essentially opens with how bad television is helping to erode the public discourse, and one of the first story arcs has a reporter cover the show because she feels such television is important to cover. These are valid, debatable points. However, the subject of Studio 60 is sketch comedy, and trying to make Studio 60 ""relevant"" comes off to me as almost pompous and a little too dramatic. Sports Night also analyzed into how its subject matter (journalism, and in particular sports journalism) could be relevant in today's society -- however, it also at several points in the show also noted that sports and sports journalism weren't necessarily the most important things in the world. A similar sense of perspective would be nice in Studio 60.2) The sketch comedy just isn't that funny. Maybe it's just me -- comedy is very subjective. However, if you're painting Studio 60 as a monumentally important sketch comedy show, it seems to me as if the sketches should be, well, funnier. Aaron Sorkin can be very funny -- I found Sports Night very funny, even if writers on The Family Guy, which I also like, apparently didn't. Still, I wouldn't classify him as a sketch comedian. Mark McKinney (of Kids in the Hall and SNL fame) is a story editor on the show -- still, I think Studio 60 would benefit deeply if there were a few more sketch comedy writers on staff. If one had to compare Studio 60 with the other NBC meta-sketch-comedy show, 30 Rock, written by former SNL head writer Tina Fey, I think it'd be fair to say that 30 Rock was funnier.Keep in mind that I am reviewing the show about five episodes into the first season. Still, as a Sorkin fan, while I'd call Studio 60 watchable, I wouldn't call it as good as his prior work, nor as good as some other work that's out there.",3,And this from a huge Aaron Sorkin fan,1161561600,"10 23, 2006",2006,2234,"['am', 'big', 'fan', 'most', 'Aaron', 'Sorkin', 'work', 'Sports', 'Night', 'West', 'Wing', 'A', 'Few', 'Good', 'Men', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'fan', 'American', 'President', 'felt', 'was', 'almost', 'trial', 'story', 'arc', 'West', 'Wing', 'being', 'said', 'wish', 'could', 'be', 'as', 'big', 'fan', 'Studio', '60', 'great', 'characters', 'compelling', 'conflicts', 'are', 'key', 'drama', 'However', 'feel', 'Studio', '60', 'falls', 'short', 'two', 'fronts:1', 'be', 'too', 'important', 'pilot', 'essentially', 'how', 'bad', 'television', 'helping', 'erode', 'public', 'discourse', 'one', 'first', 'story', 'arcs', 'reporter', 'cover', 'show', 'such', 'television', 'important', 'cover', 'are', 'valid', 'debatable', 'points', 'However', 'subject', 'Studio', '60', 'sketch', 'comedy', 'trying', 'make', 'Studio', '60', 'relevant', 'off', 'almost', 'pompous', 'little', 'too', 'dramatic', 'Sports', 'Night', 'also', 'analyzed', 'how', 'subject', 'matter', 'journalism', 'particular', 'sports', 'journalism', 'could', 'be', 'relevant', 'today', 'society', 'however', 'also', 'several', 'points', 'show', 'also', 'noted', 'sports', 'sports', 'journalism', 'were', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'most', 'important', 'things', 'world', 'similar', 'sense', 'perspective', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'Studio', '60.2', 'sketch', 'comedy', 'just', ""n't"", 'funny', 'Maybe', 'just', 'comedy', 'very', 'subjective', 'However', ""'re"", 'painting', 'Studio', '60', 'monumentally', 'important', 'sketch', 'comedy', 'show', 'sketches', 'should', 'be', 'well', 'funnier', 'Aaron', 'Sorkin', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'funny', 'found', 'Sports', 'Night', 'very', 'funny', 'even', 'writers', 'Family', 'Guy', 'also', 'like', 'apparently', 'did', ""n't"", 'Still', 'would', ""n't"", 'classify', 'sketch', 'comedian', 'Mark', 'McKinney', 'Kids', 'Hall', 'SNL', 'fame', 'story', 'editor', 'show', 'still', 'think', 'Studio', '60', 'would', 'benefit', 'deeply', 'were', 'few', 'more', 'sketch', 'comedy', 'writers', 'staff', 'one', 'had', 'compare', 'Studio', '60', 'other', 'NBC', 'meta-sketch-comedy', 'show', '30', 'Rock', 'written', 'former', 'SNL', 'head', 'writer', 'Tina', 'Fey', 'think', ""'d"", 'be', 'fair', 'say', '30', 'Rock', 'was', 'funnier.Keep', 'mind', 'am', 'reviewing', 'show', 'five', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'Still', 'Sorkin', 'fan', ""'d"", 'call', 'Studio', '60', 'watchable', 'would', ""n't"", 'call', 'as', 'good', 'prior', 'work', 'as', 'good', 'other', 'work', 'out', 'there']",Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip - The Complete Series
651558,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,B00005JPI6,Craig MACKINNON,"[0, 0]","Adding my voice to the chorus of praise for this show is somewhat redundant.  Anyone considering buying this DVD surely knows the affection the Sorkin/Schlamme team inspires in their fans.  If Studio 60 is not overall as good as the West Wing series, it's certainly as good as West Wing's first season, and who knows how far the show could have gone had it been able to continue?  Although the show-within-the-show was a sketch comedy, Studio 60 is more of a Dramedy.  I don't think it was cancelled because people didn't know what to make of it - Desperate Housewives does very well and it's got a similar combination of drama and comedy.  So where did this series go wrong?The problem is clearly not with the cast.  Sorkin alumni from the West Wing are abundant: Studio 60 regulars Matthew Perry, Timothy Busfield (who also directed some Sports Night episodes), and Bradley Whitford  were on West Wing.  Many of the Studio 60 guest stars are also old Sorkinites: Allyson Janney, John Goodman, Felicity Huffman (from Sports Night).  The direction is sure-handed and knowing.  The writing surely equals that on most of Sorkin's films and is second only to West Wing in intellegence.  The conflict between the athiest Matt and the born-again Christian Harriet is surprisingly even-handed (although Harriet is perhaps not as articulate about her faith as President Bartlett).  In fact, the second heart of the show (after the Matt-Danny dynamic) is the athiest-Christian conflict that so polarises the United States (and also France and other western democracies).  The show handles the conflict as even-handedly as any I have ever seen, this coming from a Christian that also resolutely supports the separation of Church and State.  There's also some race relations commentary when the (only) black cast member decides to take a young black comedian under his wing.No, I think the show failed in trying to rise above its genre.  People watching the West Wing would expect things like the Israeli-Palastinian conflict to arise, or school shootings, or terrorism.  That a show about comedy writers and performers should cover topics like the Afghanistan (and Iraq) War, the Patriot Act, and Red State-Blue state conflict might turn off viewers who watch TV for escapism (especially as the news itself covered enough of this material to sate the average viewer).  It's not denigrating the national audience to point out that light fare does better in times of conflict.For me, the show definitely goes off the rails for several episodes in the middle of the season.  When Amanda Peet's pregnancy became incorporated into the storyline, something strange happened.  The most important relationship in the show - that between Danny and Matt - became subsumed to the Danny-Jordan and Matt-Harriet relationships.  I think the show's writers recognized it, and the last episodes (the 4-part K&R;) were easily the equals to the earlier episodes.

651560,A1FW37K0DKH5M9,B00005JPI6,David Seaman,"[2, 2]","The first five minutes of the Pilot of Studio 60 on The Sunset Strip (Aaron Sorkin's brilliant and short lived television series after The West Wing)will explain beautifully why it is that this - the finest and most intelligent piece of television in history - lasted for only one season. Aaron Sorkin is a world class writer. In fact, not since William Shakespeare has a playwrite managed text as though each word were a notated piece of music. Sorkin has the respect of every executive, actor, crew member and writer in both Hollywood and New York, but the average television viewer is comfortably enteratined by ""Married With Children"" the formula crime shows of Dick Wolf and the formula direction of Jay Sandrich and Jim Burrows.Studio 60 is a behind the scenes look at what happens on a weekly live comedy satire show. It's modeled after the classic ""Saturday Night Live"" and what we see on the scrfeen moves as fast as what happens in the studio. Backstage is like Boston's route 128 without road dividers and Thomas Schlamme, the director, knows how to film it, cameras moving as fast as toyotas, fvery few cuts, famous ""walk and Talks, where w2e feel as though we're wlking with them. The subject magtter is brilliant and it FEELS realistic- the truth- though who would know. Though the show is written like a symphony and is about a TV show what it's really abo0ut is people. Family.And the pilot for this- as well as each subsequent episode, is clearly expensive, a remarkable set and the finest most reverred actors alive today. Matthew Perry and Bradley Whitford are remarkable. We know him as Chandler, but tis is a different man entirely and Matthew Perry is a remarkable actor. Amanda Peet, as beautiful as can be imagined, is a class act, first rate actor. Th4e supporting cast is all remarkable and many of them you know (Simon Hedburg who does a remarkable Nicholas Cage, is now a household name as Howard Wolowitz on ""{The Big Bang Theory"".) In addition, on the first 45 minutes we have Steven Webber (who makes you forget his irresponsible jokester chanracter from ""Wings"" within ten seconds) Ed Asner, Fellicity Huffman, Donna Murphy and Judd Hirsch. The budget for actors salaries alone show that the network was well invested here. I suppose that it's much like the music publishers and recording executives who, back in the 1970's and 80's, lost money on the work of Stephen Sondheim because they knew that one day he'd be recognized and they'd more than make their money back. Soprkin';s work requires an audience who must think and listen; watch and connect. It's not the sort of television that one can miss half of and still be able to chat about it at work the next dayt.like Sondheim, we'll all catch up. Now Sondheim is rehgarded as the finest composer alive and the all time best writer of musical theatre. I predicted that in 1979. Here's my prediction now: Aaron Sorkin is the next Shakespeare.This is likely the case here. You won't find a better DVD set anywhere and given the brillliance, the comedy, the speed and the acting here, you won;t want to rent it because you can watch it over and over. (John Goodman does a remarkable two episoded arch as a Nevada Judge that is some of the best work ever seen on television)We learn, we love and we see another one of Sorkin's family shows. Mom and Dad are executive producers instead of a President and CHeif of Staff, but they're all here, there's love and support and every single episode is as impressive as a major motion picture written by Aaron Sorkin- Charlie Wilson's War, A Few Good Men, Social Network.Cause if you don't know Aaron Sorkin, it's time.",5,"I'm telling you, he's the next Shakespeare",1331164800,"03 8, 2012",2012,3645,"['first', 'five', 'minutes', 'Pilot', 'Studio', '60', 'Sunset', 'Strip', 'Aaron', 'Sorkin', 'brilliant', 'short', 'lived', 'television', 'series', 'West', 'Wing', 'will', 'explain', 'beautifully', 'why', 'finest', 'most', 'intelligent', 'piece', 'television', 'history', 'lasted', 'only', 'one', 'season', 'Aaron', 'Sorkin', 'world', 'class', 'writer', 'fact', 'not', 'William', 'Shakespeare', 'playwrite', 'managed', 'text', 'word', 'were', 'notated', 'piece', 'music', 'Sorkin', 'respect', 'executive', 'actor', 'crew', 'member', 'writer', 'Hollywood', 'New', 'York', 'average', 'television', 'viewer', 'comfortably', 'enteratined', 'Married', 'Children', 'formula', 'crime', 'shows', 'Dick', 'Wolf', 'formula', 'direction', 'Jay', 'Sandrich', 'Jim', 'Burrows.Studio', '60', 'scenes', 'look', 'what', 'weekly', 'live', 'comedy', 'satire', 'show', 'modeled', 'classic', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'what', 'see', 'scrfeen', 'moves', 'as', 'fast', 'what', 'studio', 'Backstage', 'Boston', 'route', '128', 'road', 'dividers', 'Thomas', 'Schlamme', 'director', 'how', 'film', 'moving', 'as', 'fast', 'toyotas', 'fvery', 'few', 'cuts', 'famous', 'walk', 'Talks', 'where', 'w2e', 'feel', ""'re"", 'wlking', 'subject', 'magtter', 'brilliant', 'FEELS', 'truth-', 'who', 'would', 'know', 'show', 'written', 'symphony', 'TV', 'show', 'what', 'really', 'abo0ut', 'people', 'pilot', 'this-', 'as', 'well', 'subsequent', 'episode', 'clearly', 'expensive', 'remarkable', 'set', 'finest', 'most', 'reverred', 'actors', 'alive', 'today', 'Matthew', 'Perry', 'Bradley', 'Whitford', 'are', 'remarkable', 'know', 'Chandler', 'tis', 'different', 'man', 'entirely', 'Matthew', 'Perry', 'remarkable', 'actor', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'as', 'beautiful', 'can', 'be', 'imagined', 'class', 'act', 'first', 'rate', 'actor', 'Th4e', 'supporting', 'cast', 'remarkable', 'many', 'know', 'Simon', 'Hedburg', 'who', 'remarkable', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'now', 'household', 'name', 'Howard', 'Wolowitz', 'Big', 'Bang', 'Theory', 'addition', 'first', '45', 'minutes', 'have', 'Steven', 'Webber', 'who', 'forget', 'irresponsible', 'jokester', 'chanracter', 'Wings', 'ten', 'seconds', 'Ed', 'Asner', 'Fellicity', 'Huffman', 'Donna', 'Murphy', 'Judd', 'Hirsch', 'budget', 'actors', 'salaries', 'alone', 'show', 'network', 'was', 'well', 'invested', 'here', 'suppose', 'much', 'music', 'publishers', 'recording', 'executives', 'who', 'back', '1970', '80', 'lost', 'money', 'work', 'Stephen', 'Sondheim', 'knew', 'one', 'day', ""'d"", 'be', 'recognized', ""'d"", 'more', 'make', 'money', 'back', 'Soprkin', 'work', 'audience', 'who', 'must', 'think', 'listen', 'watch', 'connect', 'not', 'sort', 'television', 'one', 'can', 'miss', 'half', 'still', 'be', 'able', 'chat', 'work', 'next', 'dayt.like', 'Sondheim', ""'ll"", 'catch', 'up', 'Now', 'Sondheim', 'rehgarded', 'finest', 'composer', 'alive', 'time', 'best', 'writer', 'musical', 'theatre', 'predicted', '1979', 'Here', 'prediction', 'now', 'Aaron', 'Sorkin', 'next', 'Shakespeare.This', 'likely', 'case', 'here', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'better', 'DVD', 'set', 'anywhere', 'given', 'brillliance', 'comedy', 'speed', 'acting', 'here', 'won', 't', 'want', 'rent', 'can', 'watch', 'over', 'John', 'Goodman', 'remarkable', 'two', 'episoded', 'arch', 'Nevada', 'Judge', 'best', 'work', 'ever', 'seen', 'television', 'learn', 'love', 'see', 'one', 'Sorkin', 'family', 'Mom', 'Dad', 'are', 'executive', 'producers', 'instead', 'President', 'CHeif', 'Staff', ""'re"", 'here', 'love', 'support', 'single', 'episode', 'as', 'impressive', 'major', 'motion', 'picture', 'written', 'Aaron', 'Sorkin-', 'Charlie', 'Wilson', 'War', 'A', 'Few', 'Good', 'Men', 'Social', 'Network.Cause', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Aaron', 'Sorkin', 'time']",Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip - The Complete Series

I'm a West Wing fan and it seems that Sorkin recycles plots and relationships and without a care. It's nice to see that he is loyal to his actors.  As loyal as he is to his actors he's equally loyal to his plots and blocking.  Frantic walks down hallways and swollen pregnant (literally and figuratively) relationships are resurrected.  I'm wondering how much time he spent at SNL doing his research?  Evidently not as much time as he spent researching West Wing or A Few Good Men.  It seems his best work is writing for film.  I'm a fan of Sorkin don't get me wrong; a loyal fan.  His new series for HBO is interesting but it leaves me unsatisfied in some scenes and I can't take the hyper screaming from the lead actors.  As always there is a sexual tension between the main characters and while I'm drawn in by the comic irony I think it might be nice if Sorkin let some of his writing staff take a stab at a new plot twist.But then would it be the Sorkin drama for which we tuned in?  The West Wing changed in the final years.  Because Sorkin built such a strong foundation and strong characters the replacement writers only had to fill in the blanks--like a coloring book.  Where Sorkin may fall short in his limited plot twists he can create characters that don't bleed into each other.  That is a feat in and of itself.  He is not afraid of big casts.  He can keep the traffic flowing smoothly and that's not easy.  You become emotionally connected with his characters in the same way Shakespeare locked in his audience.The most amazing thing about Sorkin's writing is that he doesn't talk down to his audience--he demands that maybe sometimes you reach for your dictionary or go to the library and read a book or venture out and see a play--familiarize yourself with the elite clothing designers and jewelers. He's totally well rounded and his work makes me feel like I could possibly be sophisticated one day or at least I'll know what the upper-classes hold in high esteem like SAT scores well after they are 50 years old.  Who knew?All that said, Sorkin rules!  You may enjoy the series for the comedy but you will come back for the sexual tension.",3,"Sorkin, Sorkin, Sorkin...and more Sorkin",1366502400,"04 21, 2013",2013,2264,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'should', 'rate', '2', 'stars', '3', 'stars', 'Maybe', 'should', 'be', 'something', ""'m"", 'West', 'Wing', 'fan', 'Sorkin', 'plots', 'relationships', 'care', 'nice', 'see', 'loyal', 'actors', 'As', 'loyal', 'actors', 'equally', 'loyal', 'plots', 'blocking', 'Frantic', 'walks', 'down', 'hallways', 'swollen', 'pregnant', 'literally', 'figuratively', 'relationships', 'are', 'resurrected', ""'m"", 'wondering', 'how', 'much', 'time', 'spent', 'SNL', 'doing', 'research', 'Evidently', 'not', 'much', 'time', 'spent', 'researching', 'West', 'Wing', 'A', 'Few', 'Good', 'Men', 'best', 'work', 'writing', 'film', ""'m"", 'fan', 'Sorkin', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'loyal', 'fan', 'new', 'series', 'HBO', 'interesting', 'unsatisfied', 'scenes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'hyper', 'screaming', 'lead', 'actors', 'always', 'sexual', 'tension', 'main', 'characters', ""'m"", 'drawn', 'comic', 'irony', 'think', 'might', 'be', 'nice', 'Sorkin', 'let', 'writing', 'staff', 'take', 'stab', 'new', 'plot', 'twist.But', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'Sorkin', 'drama', 'tuned', 'West', 'Wing', 'changed', 'final', 'years', 'Sorkin', 'built', 'strong', 'foundation', 'strong', 'characters', 'replacement', 'only', 'had', 'fill', 'blanks', 'coloring', 'book', 'Where', 'Sorkin', 'may', 'fall', 'short', 'limited', 'plot', 'twists', 'can', 'create', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'bleed', 'other', 'feat', 'not', 'afraid', 'big', 'casts', 'can', 'keep', 'traffic', 'flowing', 'smoothly', 'not', 'easy', 'become', 'emotionally', 'connected', 'characters', 'same', 'way', 'Shakespeare', 'locked', 'audience.The', 'most', 'amazing', 'thing', 'Sorkin', 'writing', ""n't"", 'talk', 'down', 'audience', 'maybe', 'sometimes', 'reach', 'dictionary', 'go', 'library', 'read', 'book', 'venture', 'out', 'see', 'play', 'familiarize', 'elite', 'clothing', 'designers', 'jewelers', 'totally', 'well', 'rounded', 'work', 'feel', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'sophisticated', 'one', 'day', 'least', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', 'upper-classes', 'hold', 'high', 'esteem', 'SAT', 'scores', 'well', 'are', '50', 'years', 'old', 'Who', 'knew', 'said', 'Sorkin', 'rules', 'may', 'enjoy', 'series', 'comedy', 'will', 'come', 'back', 'sexual', 'tension']",Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip - The Complete Series

Superb writing, great cast, plenty of pathos, humor and angst. An abundance of biting intelligence. So why was it shot down by NBC and ignored by a larger viewing audience?Perhaps the major culprit was Aaron Sorkin himself, whose scripted pilot was frustratingly abysmal. If you got beyond the overloaded and too quickly paced first episode and hung in there, you were in for a great ride! (everyone I have implored to give the show a seoond chance after the pilot became hooked)!Another reason it may have failed was the intial timeslot- up against the powerful CSI: Miami on Monday night. As viewership slipped in the first few weeks, NBC pre-empted, and began shifting it around, losing more of its potential audience. (Friday night would have been an ideal slot for it, btw). However, this show, had it been on TNT or FX instead, would have been a resounding hit and renewed for years, I believe.Also, the confusion between this show and ""30 Rock"", both with ""behind the scenes"" concepts further eroded the base. This was a drama with humor, not a comedy!The cast had great chemistry as an ensemble and some of the ""sketches"" such as the NIcholas Cage bit were brilliantly performed.Matthew Perry at last exorcised his Chandler Bing persona; Bradley Whitford made you weep with his wooing of the gorgeous Amanda Peet; Sarah Paulson as Harriet gave a virtuoso performace each and every episode. DL Highley demostrated great acting chops in his first real dramatic role - check out his standoff with the great Steven Weber as a slimy newtwork chairman!The final 3 episode ""arc"" is as fine a trilogy to conclude a series as this viewer has seen on the tube.NBC replaced S60 with ""the Black Donnellys"", which immediately fell flat and was cancelled. And, sadly, all we are left with on Monday night is such drek as ""journeyman""- I give it 4 episodes before being yanked, and that's being generous!Well the geniuses at NBC-Universal at least saw fit to release the set on DVD. It will become a classic, to be sure.The networks persist in underestimating the intelligence of the audience and so we are left with the likes of According to Jim, Till Death, and reality shows.

651581,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B00005JPI6,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[11, 13]","With all the pre-fall hoopla going into the debut of STUDIO 60 ON THE SUNSET STRIP, and the rave reviews it had garnered, I couldn't help but tune in that Monday night at 10pm, September 18, 2006. Now, I'm not really familiar with Aaron Sorkin's prior work. I'd certainly heard of SPORTS NIGHT and THE WEST WING and was aware of the plaudits these shows have earned, but, somehow, I haven't had many occasions to consistently view episodes of them. So, going into STUDIO 60, I wasn't really saddled with preconceptions regarding the much touted writer/creator/producer. Actually, what preconceptions I've had were attributed to my being a fan of FRIENDS and of Matthew Perry, in particular, who was my favorite in that much-missed comedy series. The very few episodes of THE WEST WING that I've seen were the ones guest-starring Perry, who, I felt, acquitted himself well dramatically. So I was very curious to see him branch out and take on the predominantly serious role of Matt Albie. But, after having seen the debut episode, my focus rapidly grew to encompass the rest of the excellent cast. Eleven episodes into STUDIO 60 and I must say things are looking bright in terms of the show's quality. Every show has been golden or, at least, silvery. Thus far, my favorite episodes are the ""Pilot,"" ""The Cold Open,"" ""The West Coast Delay,"" ""The Long Lead Story,"" and ""The Christmas Show."" The ratings, however and sad to say, seem to have steadily declined. But, hopefully, NBC knows a good thing when it kicks 'em in the face and will keep this show on air. After all, they're not the FOX network (still miss you, FIREFLY).For those who care, some SPOILERS follow. The debut episode dealt with the shocking on-air blow-up of Judd Hirsch's character, the executive producer of the live sketch comedy show STUDIO 60. His 53-second tirade (ala Peter Finch's classic explosion from NETWORK) causes him to be summarily sacked and leaves the show and its personnel in shambles. This sucks for Jordan McDeere (Amanda Peet) as this is her first day as the new president of NBS, the network which has Studio 60 as its flagship show. Her first move, a preemptive act against the upcoming public and media outcry, is to immediately hire back the team of writer Matt Albie (Matthew Perry) and director/executive producer Danny Tripp (Bradley Whitford) to ramrod the show. Albie and Tripp, longtime best friends, had been fired from Studio 60 four years before in a cloud of controversy. Initially unwilling,  the duo eventually decides to come back on board and try to save the day and bring the eroded show back to its former glory. The debut and the following episodes go on to reveal a comprehensive behind-the-scenes look at the crafting of a weekly live sketch comedy show, as well as chronicle the personal lives of everyone involved. Among other things, we get to witness the supposedly now defunct romantic relationship between Matt Albie and the gorgeous and religious cast star Harriet Hayes (Sarah Paulson), the come-to-light media story of Jordan's auto accident years back - which brings her to undesirable public scrutiny, as well as her ensuing pregnancy, and Danny's drugs-and-drinks past occasionally dredged up, as well as his blossoming feelings for Jordan.The acting is above par, really excellent. I can't say enough about the chemistry between buddies Matt and Danny. It really seems as if these guys, Perry and Whitford, have known each other for eons, so natural do they bounce off each other. Also, the rapport between Perry and Paulson is pretty palpable. Amanda Peet as the young, take-charge, got-somethin'-to-prove network president does a nice job of being gutsy and cocky yet hinting at vulnerabilites here and there. D.L. Hughley was a surprise acting choice which I think pays off, although he hasn't really done anything here yet. Sarah Paulson as Harriet (supposedly based on Kristin Chenoweth, whom Sorkin dated) is simply marvelous. The sequence in episode 5 ""The Long Lead Story,"" wherein she unveils some personal life stories to a probing reporter  - well, it really showcased some very, very good acting on her part. Paulson unaffectedly exudes qualities of elegant sincerity and humor - and she does a wicked Juliette Lewis impression. I just hope, for however long this series lasts, that the writers take Matt and Harriet's romance seriously. This early in the series, I'm really rooting for them, and never more so than when, over a live Sting performance, Harriet declares to Matt, ""You knock my socks off."" Hey, I may be a guy, but I am susceptible to mushy scenes every now and then. Chances are there could also be something brewing between Danny and Jordan. Time, of course, will tell. And I gotta hand it to Steven Weber. I initially loathed his character, the sneering, eye-strictly-on-the-dollar NBS chairman Jack Rudolph, but, over the past few episodes, have glimpsed a gentler, kinder chairman and have changed my opinion of him to a more favorable one.This premise is so rife with possibilities. Just imagine the storylines that could be mined. As one possible plot tangent, just think of how crazy and surreal the lives and experiences of the Saturday Night Live cast has been and continues to be. STUDIO 60 can go to so many places here, and, as a bonus, the premise of a show within a show means that you can bring in whichever actor or performer and derive some fun from watching them be themselves, or as much as tv will let them. So, yeah, STUDIO 60, and, come to think of it, its lead-in show HEROES, have become my Monday must-see back-to-backs. Now, the only negative I can think of is that, at times, the humor introduced within the actual live comedy show, Studio 60, isn't all that funny, which undermines the credibility of the characters, in particular, Matt and Danny. So, yes, hopefully, the comedy of the show within the show becomes more consistently chuckle-worthy.Big ups to Amazon Unbox Video for hooking me up with episode 5 (so upset I'd missed it originally). For a modest $1.99 per episode - and once I got thru the lengthy initial system start up and then waited for almost an hour for the actual episode download - I finally caught ""The Long Lead Story"" -

I can't believe I'm saying this, but even DL Hughley and the guy from Friends come across as respectable artists. The director must be masterful.But Aaron Sorkin wrote this the same way he wrote The Social Network: each episode is a slowly unfolding drama with no discernible climax (except the first and the final episodes) wrapped in flashbacks to an even more boring parallel drama from a few years prior. This is blue balls as television - over and over again you become enthralled in suspenseful rising action, but then it just fades away without reaching fruition.Also, the dialogue is on the same level as Gilmore Girls: the characters constantly pummel one another with witty parlays at an unrealistic speed, often spitting out the perfect rejoinder before the other character has expressed his thought. This unnatural conversation separates the characters from the viewer. This may help Sorkin feel superior, but it gets tiring within the first three episodes. The desperate attempts to weave relevant social issues into the plot do not humanize the characters.So if you like The Social Network, Gilmore Girls and/or the sensation of blue balls, you might enjoy this show.

This was a show about what goes on behind the scenes of a once cutting edge, live skit program, similar to Saturday Night Live.  Studio 60 was one of the smartest and most entertaining shows on television last year with its insider views of life behind the scenes of a television show and a network.All of the performaces were solid across the board, but Amanda Peet always seemed too hip and young to run a television network, and Bradley Whitford's Danny Tripp seemed interchangable with his West Wing character Josh Lymann.  The show's scripts were able to be funny, nuanced, and dramatic like we would expect from a Sorkin written and created series.  But the skits on the show within a show were often so bland and cringe inducing, you wondered why the pretend show was able to surive.  While the skits were only a minor part of each Studio 60 episode, their failures would often pull you out of the great things occuring within the show.Sorkin's other two shows, Sports Night and the West Wing, are two of the best shows ever created.

651607,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JPI6,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[9, 9]","I like to watch television series from start to favorite and have over three dozen complete runs to enjoy.  My standard practice is to watch one episode a day for the series I am going through, although I might go back-to-back with a two-parter.  But when I decided to watch the one season of ""Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip"" I went through all 22 episodes in five days (it would have been less but I had other things to watch, classes to teach, time to spend sleeping, etc.).  When my wife heard what I was doing she decided to lie in bed for two days and watching the entire series from start to finish.  So that would be a pretty good indication of how much we liked the late and lamented television series from Aaron Sorkin.I am enthralled the art of writing and so wish that when it comes to writing that my attention span was better suited to actual works of literature than writing reviews.  With this television show I get to appreciate both the writing of the episodes and the parts in the episodes where people are writing.  But the bottom line remains that I simply love the way Sorkin writes and have yet to reach my saturation point with watching (although I should really say ""listening"") repeats of ""The West Wing"" the way I have other series that I love (Yes, I know that Sorkin only produced and wrote the first four seasons of the show, but those were the best ones and I would swear that those who wrote in his wake were trying to emulate his style).  It goes without saying that the same comments apply to Sorkin's first television series, ""Sports Night.""Beyond that, I find this television shows particularly affecting.  I think I got choked up more often watching ""Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip"" than for any single season of any television show I have ever seen.  I do not just mean getting teary eyed over all of the life and death questions resolved in the final episode (""What Kind of Day Has It Been""), or when Harriet tells Matt ""You knock my sox off,"" or when Danny tells Jordan ""I'm coming for you.""  I mean things like when Matt bet Jeannie $10,000 that the number of people who liked her ""Commedia dell'arte"" routine is going to go from two to three people (""The Focus Group"").  My wife probably cried more often than I did watching the show, which apparently speaks to a hitherto unrecognized point of commonality between our disparate natures, but once again reinforces our shared affection for the series.This is not to say the show was perfect, because it was not.  My first fear that the series might be fatally flawed came in the second episode where we did not get to see the Crazy Christian skit and were instead treated to reworked lyrics for a Gilbert & Sullivan songs that were okay, but not memorable.  You can only talk about a killer skit so much before you have to show the damn thing.  Of course that means you have to write an absolutely killer skit and maybe it is the case that Sorkin never tired, but what matters in the end is that we never get to see any of it in the show.  Because the point is the show behind the show we do not get to see that much of the show in front of the show behind the show, and what we do see is not stellar late night sketch comedy.  The takeoff on Nancy Grace was pretty good and I liked the dry wit of the White House press conferences, but the news segments never amounted to much of anything.  For me the funniest bit of the entire season was the running gag in ""The Harriet Dinner (1)"" of Harriet's inability to tell a joke, although I have to say it is a toss-up between Holly Hunter and Dolphin Girl for which of Harriet's voices cracks me up more.I know that Sorkin is condemned as a liberal, but he certainly writes some of the best political characters.  That was true on ""The West Wing"" with characters from Ainsley Hayes to Arnold Vinick, with the likes of Christopher Mulready and Sheila Brooks in between, and with Harriet Hayes we find Sorkin doing for evangelical Christians what he did for conservative Republicans (I always thought it would have been interesting to continue ""The West Wing"" with a Republican president to show that dramatic political storytelling is not just the province of the left).  Ultimately what makes Harriet a fascinating character is that despite the inherent contradiction, she is never going to give up her faith in God or her love for Matt.  The question is whether he will ever stop taking one step backwards for every step forward in his relationship with here.  Sorkin and his talented ensemble cast knew the show was over by the time they got to the final episode and were already to provide a sense that the characters go on even if the series does not, which provides some small measure of comfort.  I certainly appreciate that because tonight I start watching ""Carnivale,"" a series HBO jettisoned before the end was even in sight.",5,"""God, Jack, there's about seven things that are funny about

He has a great cast, with Matthew Perry and others as well as some really great cameos. However it does not really gel and in some ways it is not surprising. In many ways it is constructed in the same way as th West Wing visually. HOwever the topic is handled way too seriously. Probably that to some people this kind of television represents culturally something very important. However since it television that revolves aroud comedy and satire, probably that aspect is not apparent enough to give the real perspective. Indeed, the directing and acting is really excellent but somehow the whole thing comes off as very unfocused and at times it is extremely difficult to follow the story-lines.

This show was smart, intellectual, contemplative and had spunk and a generous portion of irreverent social commentary that should  have catapulted it into commercial stardom. For really how could a show not succeed with great actors and a strongly written scripts that challenge every concept that we claim to hold dear? Shouldn't we talk about these things? Shouldn't we interrogate our dear convictions and demand that they hold up under scrutiny? Shouldn't we all do this?Unfortunately none of this is the point. Like it or not, ""right"" or wrong, you cannot win an argument if no one is listening.You cannot light the flame of discussion if you let yourself be canceled. Aaron Sorkin is an incredibly smart guy, but his greatest challenge is for him to realize that in some ways he is TOO smart.As much as I love this show, Sorkin does sometime sound like he is preaching. He is right. I have hardly heard Sorkin saying anything that I didn't ultimately agree with, but again, that's doesn't matter. If 'Studio 60' had spent just a little more time dumbing-down it's message, perhaps it would still be on.This is an imperfect analogy but compare this situation to the original Star Trek. Gene Roddenberry wanted to talk about inter-racial politics. He wanted to talk about corruption and tremendous injustice, BUT he knew he had to do it in a framework of fiction so he could conceal his controversial messages.What I'm trying to say is simply this, you can only shout from the mountain tops as long as you can get people to listen. A prophet is no good to anybody buried 3 miles down in the bedrock. 'Studio 60' was too well written, too smart, too preachy and it was far too good for it's own survival. And now it's gone.I wish I didn't live in a country of mostly stupid people, but I do. Surely if Studio 60's ratings we only based on California and New York, it would still be on.

My friend told me that since the first episode ofSports Night - The Complete Series Boxed Set, he has loved Sorkin's ability to (as he put it) ""challenge my ears to stand up and pay attention."" We both agreed, my friend and I, that Sorkin is a master of the spoken word. He uses dialogue better than anyone writing in American cinema or television today. And STUDIO 60 was no exception. My friend told me that STUDIO 60 was one of the most enticing shows his ears had ever enjoyed. So when my friend heard that STUDIO 60 was being cancelled, he was very upset. I was too. My friend told me that watching STUDIO 60 made him ""feel as if I could see the action right in front of me."" It made my friend think. It made him feel. But most of all, it made him SEE. I hope I am not putting too fine a point on it... but STUDIO 60 - and specifically Sorkin's use of language and tempo - gave my friend a sense of what it might be like to enjoy a television show with ALL of his senses.Those were my friend's feelings; these are mine.

Every single one of the female characters that Sorkin has ever created have such presence, such guts. He gives them every ounce of respect, then he ratchets up their intelligence and moxy to a level rarely seen on television. You can tell he really respects women.Sports Night - The Complete Series Boxed Setwas a fantastic show (and well ahead of its time) with strong female characters that matched their male counterparts blow for blow.The West Wing - The Complete First Four Seasons (4-Pack)(at least the first four seasons) was even better, giving Allison Janney tons of meaty material to sink her acting skills into. (But when Sorkin left the show, I did as well.) Then came STUDIO 60. Again, strong female characters equal in every way to their male counterparts... but... I will readily admit that when the show first began its short lived run on Monday nights, I found it to be a bit difficult to care about. More to the point, I found the relationship between Matt Albie (Matthew Perry) and Harriet Hayes (Sarah Paulson) difficult to care about. All they ever seemed to do was fight. But as the episodes progressed... and specifically after the two month hiatus that NBC put the show into from March through early May 2007... I found myself rooting for them. The show became as exhilarating as anything Sorkin has done. Who could forget when John Goodman stole the show (and won an Emmy) for his portrayal of a kind hearted, rural town Judge in the two part Nevada Day episodes? When he wagged his finger at Danny Tripp (Bradley Whitford) and ordered him to ""Stop thinking everyone living between (New York) and (Los Angeles) just stepped out of the cast of Hee-Haw. Tell your friends!"" Or the very end of The Disaster Show when Cal Shanley (Timothy Busfield) reminds Allison Janney that ""it sure beats digging holes for a living."" Or the moment when Danny Tripp (Bradley Whitford) reminds Matt Albie (Matthew Perry) in both the Pilot and The Christmas Show that ""we live here now."" Or The Christmas Show itself, when the displaced musicians from New Orleans were spotlighted during a soulful rendition of O' Holy Night? If you did not shed at least a small tear as that song ended, then you have no soul. Or most of all, the four part K&R; story arc that brought the horrors of war home for one character in particular. I cannot list all of the great moments from STUDIO 60 because there are far too many. Like others here have mentioned, the show caused me to laugh AND to cry in the same one hour time span. THAT is saying a lot.I have read other reviews commenting that ""if you did not get it, poor you."" I don't think ""getting it"" had anything to do with the shows cancellation. When one considers that NBC chose to replace STUDIO 60 with a show entitled THE NATIONAL SINGING BEE... one can clearly see that ""getting it or not getting it"" was never a factor in the decision. NBC was clearly catering to the lowest common denominator. THE NATIONAL SINGING BEE instead of STUDIO 60? You've got to be kidding me. I cannot give a good reason for the shows cancellation. I doubt very strongly that anyone can. Sorkin knew this might happen. He's been there before. That's why, during the episode titled Breaking News, Matt Albie (Matthew Perry) tells network exec Jack Rudolph (Steven Weber) ""Ratings are cyclical, Jack. Who the hell knows why anybody watches anything?""Lastly, as to the release of the show on DVD, I have two issues that had me strongly considering giving this set only four stars instead of five - which the SHOW ITSELF clearly deserved.1. The title: Calling this set THE COMPLETE SERIES insults the viewers understanding that the show itself was NEVER INTENDED to run for only one season. I have no doubt that Sorkin and the cast intended to see this show run for many years. Did Warner Brothers home video actually think that consumers would be confused if they had simply labeled this set THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON? I knew there was never going to be a Season Two once the show was cancelled...2. The Audio Commentary: During the Pilot episode on disc one, both Aaron Sorkin and Thomas Schlamme provide a brief discussion/commentary on the show and its inception. One glaring omission, however, is evident throughout. The commentary was recorded WHILE THE SHOW WAS STILL IN PRODUCTION, therefore, NO DISCUSSION IS EVER PRESENTED AS TO THE REASON FOR OR TIMING OF THE SHOW'S CANCELLATION. The cancellation is never even mentioned. I feel that in NOT allowing Sorkin to comment on the show's demise robs BOTH the producers AND the fans of a vital piece of the puzzle. Personally, I was searching for some kind of explanation on this matter. Namely: Was Sorkin given a chance to alter the final story arc to coincide with the show's cancellation? Did he completely re-write the show's ending to suit the network decision? None of this comes to light on the discs, as the commentary quickly shows.That said, I am pleased to have this boxed set in my Sorkin Collection. The show took some time to build momentum, and that leads me (and many others) to wonder what if? What if there had been a Second Season? Oh well. Like I said at the start of this review... the show was so good even a blind man could see it. Too bad NBC execs were too blind to do the same. Here is to hoping for more of the same from Sorkin and company. After all, it sure beats digging holes for a living.",5,So good a blind man could see it!,1231804800,"01 13, 2009",2009,6818,"['have', 'friend', 'friend', 'blind', 'been', 'birth', 'television',

651658,A2PGNI5W89IP0Q,B00005JPI6,"travelertc ""tc""","[132, 136]","On the one hand, it didn't crackle the same way Sports Night or The West Wing did, and plot inconsistencies and occasional heavy handedness revealed a show that never fully trusted its truth. Still, I can't shake the feeling that Studio 60 is a link in an evolution toward a new, more complicated, more interesting television. NBC should have given it more time to find itself. Doing that would have benefitted the network, the audience, maybe even the society (that's a lot of pressure!)Imperfections included, Studio 60 made me laugh, it made me cry, it literally made me cheer, and it did what Aaron Sorkin's work always does: celebrate the human condition (instead of tearing it down, as many shows do.) Like other Sorkin series, Studio 60 focused on people of good will doing their best to support each other and create something of value. I inevitably felt cleansed when I watched it, and I didn't clear the episodes from my DVR until the DVD was in my mailbox.As for the DVD, I wish there had been more extras on it than the Pilot commentary, and a mini-documntary made early in the season. It would have been fascinating to hear Mr. Sorkin and his partner Tommy Schlamme have an honest discussion of the strengths and weaknesses, successes and demise of this show.
