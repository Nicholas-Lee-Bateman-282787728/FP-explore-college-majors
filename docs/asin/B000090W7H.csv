She is not hearing impaired but we thought it beneficial to teach her sign language as a second language to help her communictae with us before she could talk. She loved the videos and even asked to watch them. She did her first sign at 10 months and asked for 'Milk"". Now she is 2 years old an still mesmerized by the videos adn loves watching them. She now knows all the signs from the first three videos and signs them often. She is also talking a lot now and signing has in no way impaired her speech or slowed it down.These videos are pleaseing to the eye both for children adn grown ups. Many children sign the signs adn it is also repeeated verbally to help your hearing child to pick up the words. they are bright colourful adn the songs are beautiful adn very catchy.I would recommend these videos to anyone interested in teaching sign to their children.

These include some food signs, a couple emotions, and more.  The songs are very captivating and teach even more signs.Signing Time is a great way to introduce children to a second language, ASL.  It is also the perfect way for babies to communicate before they develop speech.  I can't count the times we've prevented a temper tantrum!

751092,A3GQWBQLT4I2X2,B000090W7H,Jennifer O'Daniel,"[1, 1]","We discovered Signing Time while researching ASL (American Sign Language) as a 2nd language for our children. We knew we wanted to teach ASL as a 2nd language because of the many benefits such as earlier communication. You can communicate with your baby as young as 8 months old, maybe even younger. What a gift to know what your child needs before they can tell you with spoken words! For more information on the benefits of ASL check out the Signing Time website at [...]We love this volume of Signing Time. The songs are wonderful and work very well in a school setting as well as at home. The songs are very catchy so you will find they get stuck in your head. Alex and Leah do a great job. We love to see the 2 friends/cousins interacting together.We like that the written word comes on the screen first and then they show the sign. It is very helpful for practicing the signs. It is like a video flashcard. It also helps children develop reading skills because they start to recognize the written word that goes with the sign. We love watching the children do the signs because you see lots of different kids and lots of different skill levels. It gives you an idea of how your child might make the sign at different ages. Rachel also does the sign so you can clearly see the proper way to do it.The song during the credits is a great way to learn additional signs that were not covered in the show. You can really add to your signing vocabulary if you pay attention.I highly recommend this volume of signing time as well as the other 5 in the series. As a mother and a teacher I can say it is truly the best educational tool I have found for teaching ASL to children (and adults too). I hope they make many more and I will buy them all without hesitation.

751095,A1HW4O8XGHWSPM,B000090W7H,Kim,"[3, 4]","What a wonderful DVD!  The songs are catchy, the colors are bright, the words are perfect for a toddler/preschooler, Rachel is engaging in her facial expressions and her signs are easily understandable for parents to learn and reinforce with their children. The children's voices throughout the DVD capture my daughter's attention and because each word is signed by multiple kids and Rachel - it allows our daughter to try it herself!I think best of all is that my curiosity of Rachel and Emilie led me to search out their own story on the net and this DVD set is really a labor of love since Leah (the little girl in the DVD) is Rachel's daughter and she was born deaf.  Rachel had been a singer/songwriter in a band and she put everything on hold to learn ASL for herself and her child/family.  This DVD collection is her hope to enable many young children to learn ASL and not avoid deaf children they come in contact with on the playground, at the schoolyard etc.  Like all parents, it's hard to see other children ignore our own child. This DVD will hopefully allow Leah and other deaf children an avenue to communicate with new friends.",5,I am amazed that our 3 year old picked up all the signs in less than 24 hours!,1131408000,"11 8, 2005",2005,1142,"['What', 'wonderful', 'DVD', 'songs', 'are', 'catchy', 'colors', 'are', 'bright', 'words', 'are', 'perfect', 'toddler/preschooler', 'Rachel', 'engaging', 'facial', 'expressions', 'signs', 'are', 'easily', 'understandable', 'parents', 'learn', 'reinforce', 'children', 'children', 'voices', 'DVD', 'capture', 'daughter', 'attention', 'word', 'signed', 'multiple', 'kids', 'Rachel', 'daughter', 'try', 'think', 'best', 'curiosity', 'Rachel', 'Emilie', 'led', 'search', 'out', 'own', 'story', 'net', 'DVD', 'set', 'really', 'labor', 'love', 'Leah', 'little', 'girl', 'DVD', 'Rachel', 'daughter', 'was', 'born', 'deaf', 'Rachel', 'had', 'been', 'singer/songwriter', 'band', 'put', 'everything', 'hold', 'learn', 'ASL', 'herself', 'child/family', 'DVD', 'collection', 'hope', 'enable', 'many', 'young', 'children', 'learn', 'ASL', 'not', 'avoid', 'deaf', 'children', 'come', 'contact', 'playground', 'schoolyard', 'etc', 'parents', 'hard', 'see', 'other', 'children', 'own', 'child', 'DVD', 'will', 'hopefully', 'allow', 'Leah', 'other', 'deaf', 'children', 'avenue', 'communicate', 'new', 'friends']",Signing Time!
