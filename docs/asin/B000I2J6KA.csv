The story revolves around the British prime minister's perennial bodyguard, Walter H Thompson (Walter for short) and the almost innumerable attempts to assassinate Churchill. Occasionally, the story is humorous, with Churchill recklessly standing on a roof top, longing to see German V1 rockets at close range. Walter must have worked overtime to save the British war leader from himself! One episode deals with the Nazi-Iranian conspiracy to kill Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin at the Tehran Conference.It seems some other reviewers weren't as satisfied with the series as I was. After all, most of the material shown consists of stills of Winston, Walter and other prominent politicians or military men, plus a lot of maps. Well, it's a historical documentary, guys, not a Hollywood flick. Want some action? Go watch &#8220;Inglourious Basterds&#8221;, ha ha.

1018529,AIM1A1HIA6TAD,B000I2J6KA,Col William Russell,"[1, 2]","Thompson's memoirs are good material but many episodes repeat much of what has already been said in earlier ones. Perhaps to spread the episodes out and sell more DVDs? The modern color footage used to interspace black & white footage is badly blurred. Whether simply poorly done or a misguided attempt to ""match"" the earlier footage. The black & white footage is also not original but badly copied from multi-generation copies with no attempt to try digital restoration. It was also filmed by someone who knew little or nothing of history. Dialog tells of Thompson checking his revolver while the film has a hand holding a .45 automatic.

They are a unique biography of Winston during his adult life with emphasis on his 1920-1945 period.  They also contain large amounts of history of the countries occupied by Britain. It contains hours of newsreel coverage of his activities with narative which describes things that are not mentioned by book writers.  I prize this set of DVDs with the same passion for my book collection of Gilbert biographies.Some more information to improve your appreciation of the program series, back around 1990 the US government released the Venona code word decripts of the code breaking efforts in the war.  It was revealed that the top three advisors to president Roosevelt were Soviet agents.

It is largely based on Thompson's own account and I found it enjoyable to watch. There is some film material such as Churchill's meetings with Roosevelt but otherwise it relies on animations and there is copious duplication which is perhaps understandable but nevertheless annoying. I was amazed to hear about the dangerous journeys undertaken by Churchill using air and sea; for me the series was worth watching for that alone. There is a narrator and also a commentary spoken by the actor Denis Waterman playing the part of Thompson. Unfortunately a bad piece of casting because Denis has a totally different London accent. But, if you are interested in the history of the Second World War, I think you will find this series worth watching.",5,An interesting story,1387584000,"12 21, 2013",2013,940,"['story', 'W', 'H', 'Thompson', 'who', 'was', 'Churchill', 'official', 'police', 'bodyguard', 'two', 'periods', 'Churchill', 'was', 'government', 'office', 'not', 'wildness', 'years', 'First', 'World', 'War', 'largely', 'based', 'Thompson', 'own', 'account', 'found', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'film', 'material', 'such', 'Churchill', 'meetings', 'Roosevelt', 'otherwise', 'animations', 'copious', 'duplication', 'perhaps', 'understandable', 'nevertheless', 'annoying', 'was', 'amazed', 'hear', 'dangerous', 'journeys', 'undertaken', 'Churchill', 'using', 'air', 'sea', 'series', 'was', 'worth', 'watching', 'alone', 'narrator', 'also', 'commentary', 'spoken', 'actor', 'Denis', 'Waterman', 'playing', 'part', 'Thompson', 'Unfortunately', 'bad', 'piece', 'casting', 'Denis', 'totally', 'different', 'London', 'accent', 'are', 'interested', 'history', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'think', 'will', 'find', 'series', 'watching']",CHURCHILL'S BODYGUARD

The first two episodes in particular have a paucity of story line and pictures to work with and the hype for what we we're about to be told amounts to way more than the telling itself. In every session, the modern color footage interspursed with the black and white original is all blurred so that it makes your eyes ache to watch it. We are shown the legs and feet of two actors walking along the street a number of times in every session, as well as a pen writing the last lines on a piece of paper (it is supposed to be Walter writing in his memoirs.) Occasionally we get a map with a journey shown in a snaking red line, which is sometimes helpful, sometimes confusing, and often repeated.  When we are shown an old photograph, the camera usually focuses on the person's stomach and slowly pans up to the face, and really their stomachs are not at all interesting. Sometimes confusing newsreels are included that are connected to Churchill only in a round-about fashion, such as riots in India when he was in New York.

I have always been a big fan of Churchill and after watching this docudrama I even think more highly now of Churchill.  There was nothing fake about Churchill what the public saw was the real man even when he was alone with no one around.  I guess that is what made him such a great leader, he didn't say what he thought people wanted to hear he said what he thought people needed to know and he did make enemies doing this. You may not always agree with his opinions but you have to love a man how has such strong character.  With that said I was shocked at how many times Churchill's life was in danger and how hard it was to protect him.  I don't want to give anything away but if you like to study this era of history then this is something you should watch.
