This sequel chose to focus on the story versus the dancing. The first film had a more compelling story.However...there is something that makes me like this one better...although I LOVE the first one's final dance solo better and have watched that part of the film over and over.This one just had a lot more funny characters and was notably LIGHTER in tone. The surprise is the final dance group number that is delightful.Isabella Miko is STUNNING as Sarah. However her dance numbers just don't sizzle (aside from one early ballet solo)...mostly just so so. Columbus Short has an ELECTRIFYING smile and made the movie doubly enjoyable. Jacqueline Bisset was excellent as the hard nosed Julliard dance professor.This is a light film that will make you smile.",4,Lighter Story Than The Original.

1003901,A2BEU7GPGNIG44,B000GG4Y5U,Dorrie Wheeler,"[20, 20]","Paramount and MTV have released Save The Last Dance 2. The direct to DVD release arrives in stores October 10th. Izabella Miko stars in the film as Chicago native Sarah. She arrives in New York to attend Julliard with a firm love of hip-hop and a love of ballet. Shortly after arriving at Julliard she meets Miles. Miles is all about hip-hop and he takes an interest in Sarah and provides her with creative stimulation both inside and outside of the classroom. He is a Julliard drop out who now teaches at the school. Sarah isn't the greatest dancer in the world, but her mixture of classic ballet moves and modern hip-hop dance bring her fans, especially at the club when she wins a dance off up against the clubs hottest female dancer. Nightlife aside, Sarah has to keep up with a demanding ballet program all in efforts to become a prima ballerina. On top of that, her ballet teacher has a strong dislike of hip-hop culture. The ""poignant, heart wrenching"" aspect of the film comes with Sarah on a mission to find out why Miles dropped out of Julliard. She just can't understand why someone would give up on a Julliard education.Save The Last Dance 2 is an entertaining film, although the storyline isn't as poignant or well written as the original film. Certain elements of the film will remind a true film buff of the 80's dance film Girls Just Want To Have Fun The Movie. Take Save The Last Dance 2 for what it's worth, 82 minutes of home entertainment. The film includes a hip-hop flavored soundtrack and a guest appearance from R&B; sensation Ne-Yo. One thing I noticed is several times the actresses native accent slips through in a few scenes. Izabella Miko is a Polish native who moved to the United States to pursue a ballet career, so she is no stranger to the ballet world.Save The Last Dance 2 is rated PG-13. As for the rating, there isn't much harsh language but there is a rather intimate bedroom love scene between the two lead characters which was pretty unnecessary.",4,Cool Movie To Check Out On DVD,1160006400,"10 5, 2006",2006,1987,"['Paramount', 'MTV', 'have', 'released', 'Save', 'Last', 'Dance', '2', 'direct', 'DVD', 'release', 'stores', 'October', '10th', 'Izabella', 'Miko', 'stars', 'film', 'Chicago', 'native', 'Sarah', 'New', 'York', 'attend', 'Julliard', 'firm', 'love', 'hip-hop', 'love', 'ballet', 'Shortly', 'arriving', 'Julliard', 'Miles', 'Miles', 'hip-hop', 'interest', 'Sarah', 'creative', 'stimulation', 'classroom', 'Julliard', 'drop', 'who', 'now', 'school', 'Sarah', ""n't"", 'greatest', 'dancer', 'world', 'mixture', 'classic', 'ballet', 'moves', 'modern', 'hip-hop', 'dance', 'bring', 'fans', 'especially', 'club', 'when', 'dance', 'off', 'up', 'clubs', 'hottest', 'female', 'dancer', 'Nightlife', 'aside', 'Sarah', 'keep', 'up', 'demanding', 'ballet', 'program', 'efforts', 'become', 'prima', 'ballerina', 'top', 'ballet', 'teacher', 'strong', 'dislike', 'hip-hop', 'culture', 'poignant', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'aspect', 'film', 'Sarah', 'mission', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'Miles', 'dropped', 'Julliard', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'someone', 'would', 'give', 'up', 'Julliard', 'education.Save', 'Last', 'Dance', '2', 'entertaining', 'film', 'storyline', ""n't"", 'as', 'poignant', 'well', 'written', 'original', 'film', 'Certain', 'elements', 'film', 'will', 'remind', 'true', 'film', 'buff', '80', 'dance', 'film', 'Girls', 'Just', 'Want', 'Have', 'Fun', 'Movie', 'Take', 'Save', 'Last', 'Dance', '2', 'what', 'worth', '82', 'minutes', 'home', 'entertainment', 'film', 'hip-hop', 'flavored', 'soundtrack', 'guest', 'appearance', 'R', 'B', 'sensation', 'Ne-Yo', 'One', 'thing', 'noticed', 'several', 'times', 'actresses', 'native', 'accent', 'slips', 'few', 'scenes', 'Izabella', 'Miko', 'Polish', 'native', 'who', 'moved', 'United', 'States', 'pursue', 'ballet', 'career', 'stranger', 'ballet', 'world.Save', 'Last', 'Dance', '2', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'rating', ""n't"", 'much', 'harsh', 'language', 'rather', 'intimate', 'bedroom', 'love', 'scene', 'two', 'lead', 'characters', 'was', 'pretty', 'unnecessary']",N/A

While the cast isn't big names the actors and actress are very well known. Anyone who studies dance and the art of dance right now will recognize the name Columbus Short as he is the lead male in this movie he is also a choreographer for some of today's top artist. Izabella Miko fits into her role perfectly as seeing that she travel from England to learn how to be a balliernia. With her heart set on being the best she realizes that her love for hiphop and dance will near fail. But when she finds herself having to choose between the two she doesn't know which way to turn but she does make the realization that she can't live without both. This movie was a movie that I can see myself watching quite often it wasn't a big hit like the first Save The Last Dance with Julia Stiles & Sean Patrick Thomas but it was defiantly a great follow up.,5,For All The Hip Hop Heads,1168646400,"01 13, 2007",2007,945,"['saw', 'Save', 'Last', 'Dance', 'movie', 'then', 'think', 'will', 'like', 'Save', 'Last', 'Dance', '2', 'cast', ""n't"", 'big', 'names', 'actors', 'actress', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'known', 'Anyone', 'who', 'studies', 'dance', 'art', 'dance', 'right', 'now', 'will', 'recognize', 'name', 'Columbus', 'Short', 'lead', 'male', 'movie', 'also', 'choreographer', 'today', 'top', 'artist', 'Izabella', 'Miko', 'role', 'perfectly', 'seeing', 'travel', 'England', 'learn', 'how', 'be', 'balliernia', 'heart', 'set', 'being', 'best', 'love', 'hiphop', 'dance', 'will', 'near', 'fail', 'when', 'having', 'choose', 'two', ""n't"", 'know', 'way', 'turn', 'make', 'realization', 'ca', ""n't"", 'live', 'movie', 'was', 'movie', 'can', 'see', 'watching', 'quite', 'often', 'was', ""n't"", 'big', 'hit', 'first', 'Save', 'Last', 'Dance', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'Sean', 'Patrick', 'Thomas', 'was', 'defiantly', 'great', 'follow', 'up']",N/A

1003908,A188WBZZMNHMZ4,B000GG4Y5U,tiggrie AKA Sarah,"[1, 1]","As other reviewers have said, the lead character in this film is now played by Izabella Miko, not Julia Stiles. Immediately this ups the credibility of the ballet dancing - and gives us a less able actress in the lead role. You win some, you lose some.Miko actually isn't that bad, she's just not a patch on Stiles.Given that the action has moved to New York and ""my boyfriend and I decided to see other people"", this means we lose any real continuity with the first movie.Columbus Short however as the love interest is easy on the eye and pretty good in the role, though the lead couple don't really have the chemistry to make it completely believable.Jacqueline Bisset is formidable as the scary ballet mistress who makes Sara's life a misery, and there are some other good supporting performances.To watch, it feels like a long-ish movie, even though it's just 80 minutes long. I think probably because of a worn out plot and no huge surprises or plot twists (there's just the one, which I found pretty unbelievable, so it didn't really hit home).All in all, it's an OK movie: for a chick flick or a teen night in, you could do better but you could also do SO much worse. However as a sequel to a strong movie like Save The Last Dance, it falls rather flat, and certainly doesn't conclude nearly as strongly as the first did. It would have worked better as a stand alone movie, although of course you can understand the desire to build on the success of the hit.Overall, it's fine: some good music on the soundtrack, some decent performances, some good dancing and a couple of really clever shots cinematically. It's reasonably rewarding to watch. Just don't expect anything of the calibre, thematically or in terms of the quality of performances etc, that you saw in the first movie.",3,"Slightly disappointing, but not awful.",1327276800,"01 23, 2012",2012,1787,"['other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'lead', 'character', 'film', 'now', 'played', 'Izabella', 'Miko', 'not', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'Immediately', 'credibility', 'ballet', 'dancing', 'less', 'able', 'actress', 'lead', 'role', 'win', 'lose', 'some.Miko', 'actually', ""n't"", 'bad', 'just', 'not', 'patch', 'Stiles.Given', 'action', 'moved', 'New', 'York', 'boyfriend', 'decided', 'see', 'other', 'people', 'lose', 'real', 'continuity', 'first', 'movie.Columbus', 'Short', 'however', 'love', 'interest', 'easy', 'eye', 'pretty', 'good', 'role', 'lead', 'couple', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'chemistry', 'make', 'completely', 'believable.Jacqueline', 'Bisset', 'formidable', 'scary', 'ballet', 'mistress', 'who', 'Sara', 'life', 'misery', 'are', 'other', 'good', 'supporting', 'performances.To', 'watch', 'long-ish', 'movie', 'even', 'just', '80', 'minutes', 'long', 'think', 'probably', 'worn', 'out', 'plot', 'huge', 'surprises', 'plot', 'twists', 'just', 'one', 'found', 'pretty', 'unbelievable', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'hit', 'home', '.All', 'OK', 'movie', 'chick', 'flick', 'teen', 'night', 'could', 'do', 'better', 'could', 'also', 'do', 'SO', 'much', 'worse', 'However', 'sequel', 'strong', 'movie', 'Save', 'Last', 'Dance', 'rather', 'flat', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'conclude', 'nearly', 'as', 'strongly', 'first', 'did', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'stand', 'alone', 'movie', 'course', 'can', 'understand', 'desire', 'build', 'success', 'hit.Overall', 'fine', 'good', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'decent', 'performances', 'good', 'dancing', 'couple', 'really', 'clever', 'shots', 'cinematically', 'reasonably', 'rewarding', 'watch', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'anything', 'calibre', 'thematically', 'terms', 'quality', 'performances', 'etc', 'saw', 'first', 'movie']",N/A
