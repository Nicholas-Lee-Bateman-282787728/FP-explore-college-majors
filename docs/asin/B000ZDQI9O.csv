1121916,A16VBGC40GIQJ8,B000ZDQI9O,Amy,"[1, 1]",I liked this documentary because it's told from John Wilkes Boothe's perspective. Usually the Lincoln assassination is told from the Lincoln perspective. This one tells you what Boothe was doing while the whole nation was tracking him.  It also tells you what was going on in the nation in the days after the assassination.,5,Original,1359244800,"01 27, 2013",2013,323,"['liked', 'documentary', 'told', 'John', 'Wilkes', 'Boothe', 'perspective', 'Usually', 'Lincoln', 'assassination', 'told', 'Lincoln', 'perspective', 'one', 'what', 'Boothe', 'was', 'doing', 'whole', 'nation', 'was', 'tracking', 'also', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'nation', 'days', 'assassination']",The Hunt for John Wilkes Booth

Johnson ""Love The Outdoors""","[1, 1]","After reading Killing Lincoln by Bill O'Reilly, I became quite interested in all the history that surrounded Lincoln's Presidency and of course, his assassination. I thought I was well versed in the details that John Wilkes Booth had shot Lincoln while he was attending an event at the Ford's Theater.There is so much more to the story of the assassination and the characters who conspired with John Wilkes Booth to not only kill Lincoln but assassinate other top level leaders in the government leaving the US floundering. John Wilkes Booth had an evil entourage assisting him in the plans to kill Lincoln. Even a woman was one of the conspirators and was the first woman who was hanged as punishment for her crime. This DVD will keep you on the edge of your seat as you see how each person in this conspiracy had a role to play and when the house of cards began to crumble it left John Wilkes Booth in a predicament that he could not act his way out of. An excellent portrayal of the days leading up to and following the plan to kill Mr. Lincoln.",5,Intriguing Facts and Presentation on John Wilkes Booth,1371081600,"06 13, 2013",2013,1048,"['reading', 'Killing', 'Lincoln', 'Bill', ""O'Reilly"", 'became', 'quite', 'interested', 'history', 'surrounded', 'Lincoln', 'Presidency', 'course', 'assassination', 'thought', 'was', 'well', 'versed', 'details', 'John', 'Wilkes', 'Booth', 'had', 'shot', 'Lincoln', 'was', 'attending', 'event', 'Ford', 'Theater.There', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'story', 'assassination', 'characters', 'who', 'conspired', 'John', 'Wilkes', 'Booth', 'not', 'only', 'kill', 'Lincoln', 'assassinate', 'other', 'top', 'level', 'leaders', 'government', 'leaving', 'US', 'floundering', 'John', 'Wilkes', 'Booth', 'had', 'evil', 'entourage', 'assisting', 'plans', 'kill', 'Lincoln', 'Even', 'woman', 'was', 'one', 'conspirators', 'was', 'first', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'hanged', 'punishment', 'crime', 'DVD', 'will', 'keep', 'edge', 'seat', 'see', 'how', 'person', 'conspiracy', 'had', 'role', 'play', 'when', 'house', 'cards', 'began', 'crumble', 'left', 'John', 'Wilkes', 'Booth', 'predicament', 'could', 'not', 'act', 'way', 'excellent', 'portrayal', 'days', 'leading', 'up', 'following', 'plan', 'kill', 'Mr.', 'Lincoln']",The Hunt for John Wilkes Booth

The two-hour documentary was based on the highly acclaimed Michael Kauffman book,American Brutus: John Wilkes Booth and the Lincoln Conspiracies. I found it both educational and entertaining, narrating the events of President Lincoln's assassination and the thrilling 12-day manhunt for Booth and co-conspirator, David E. Herold. The overall presentation was excellent. The reenactments were well-done. There was great music and wonderful images.
