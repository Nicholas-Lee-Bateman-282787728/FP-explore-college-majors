1137539,A17ZP3VKZ4QRWT,B0012IX3CQ,Charlie Brooks,"[0, 0]","I'm biased because I'm a Giants fan, but I think the 2007-2008 New York Giants season is one of the best sports stories ever. A team that was on the verge of getting broken down and rebuilding suddenly became a championship squad capable of defeating one of the best teams in NFL history. This DVD does a good job of chronicling that season, showing the highs and lows of the journey to the Super Bowl.It's worth noting that this DVD is more of a season overview rather than something about the Super Bowl specifically. This covers everything from training camp up until the final whistle of Super Bowl XLII. If you want the Super Bowl specifically, you should probably find another DVD. Personally, I like the season overview because it gives a good feel for the long road to a championship, from those first two games where the Giants looked hopeless until they finally became world beaters.The one criticism I have for this volume is that it doesn't really give the historical context of how big an upset Super Bowl XLII was. The Patriots were supposedly the best team in the history of the game, and the Giants were expected to get annihilated. The DVD mentions that the Patriots were undefeated, but not that they had the top offense in history, a quarterback who threw 50 touchdowns in a season, a wide receiver who broke the NFL record for touchdown receptions, the league's top-ranked scoring defense, a Hall of Fame coach, and a core group that had already won three Super Bowls. There was so much historical significance that could have been touched upon that was glossed over.Ultimately, though, the story isn't about the fall of the Patriots but rather the rise of the Giants. This story tells the tale of the Giants' greatest season in a remarkable way that is well worth the money.",4,A Good Memento of one of the Best Seasons,1387497600,"12 20, 2013",2013,1795,"[""'m"", 'biased', ""'m"", 'Giants', 'fan', 'think', '2007-2008', 'New', 'York', 'Giants', 'season', 'one', 'best', 'sports', 'stories', 'ever', 'team', 'was', 'verge', 'getting', 'broken', 'down', 'rebuilding', 'suddenly', 'became', 'championship', 'squad', 'capable', 'defeating', 'one', 'best', 'teams', 'NFL', 'history', 'DVD', 'good', 'job', 'chronicling', 'season', 'showing', 'highs', 'lows', 'journey', 'Super', 'Bowl.It', 'worth', 'noting', 'DVD', 'more', 'season', 'overview', 'rather', 'something', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'specifically', 'everything', 'training', 'camp', 'up', 'final', 'whistle', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'XLII', 'want', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'specifically', 'should', 'probably', 'find', 'DVD', 'Personally', 'like', 'season', 'overview', 'good', 'feel', 'long', 'road', 'championship', 'first', 'two', 'games', 'where', 'Giants', 'looked', 'hopeless', 'finally', 'became', 'world', 'beaters.The', 'one', 'criticism', 'have', 'volume', ""n't"", 'really', 'give', 'historical', 'context', 'how', 'big', 'upset', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'XLII', 'was', 'Patriots', 'were', 'supposedly', 'best', 'team', 'history', 'game', 'Giants', 'were', 'expected', 'get', 'annihilated', 'DVD', 'mentions', 'Patriots', 'were', 'undefeated', 'not', 'had', 'top', 'offense', 'history', 'quarterback', 'who', 'threw', '50', 'touchdowns', 'season', 'wide', 'receiver', 'who', 'broke', 'NFL', 'record', 'touchdown', 'receptions', 'league', 'top-ranked', 'scoring', 'defense', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'coach', 'core', 'group', 'had', 'already', 'won', 'three', 'Super', 'Bowls', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'historical', 'significance', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'touched', 'was', 'glossed', 'over.Ultimately', 'story', ""n't"", 'fall', 'Patriots', 'rather', 'rise', 'Giants', 'story', 'tale', 'Giants', 'greatest', 'season', 'remarkable', 'way', 'well', 'money']",NFL Super Bowl XLII - New York Giants Championship

The film covers the highlights of all the games right through the season and has interviews with key players and coaches. It's great to see how the second half turnaround against the Redskins in week 3 transformed the season from almost being an 0-3 start and Tom Coughlin being fired, to being the biggest underdog shock winners of the Superbowl that I can remember.The playoff wins against Dallas and Green Bay get some extra coverage and although there isn't that much of the Superbowl, all the best parts are there. After all, not much happened in the big game until the fourth quarter, but Plaxico Burress's catch for the winning score still sends a shiver down my spine.

Having followed the Giants more closely, this year, it was still amazing to relive it again with this DVD.  Many years ago, when I was in college, I was lucky to spend a few summers at the Cleveland Browns training camp.  Seeing these guys eating raw steak in the cafeteria, play scrimmage, and hangout during some downtime moments, etc., gave me an appreciation of the rigors of training, competition and skill involved in the process.  Just having to bring together a diverse group of talented athletes, (some who will make the grade and some who will be cut) to eventually become ""a team"", is a truly amazing process.  The comments by Giants players and staff in this DVD give you a sense how intense their jobs are and how incredible their season and Super Bowl victory was.  I also enjoyed the additional material, but wished they would have had some real footage on the celebration parade back in New York that the team and the fans seemed to really enjoy.

Other have Americans game the SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONSHIP and shows the ring on the cover. Did I miss something? Would that mean the game is what the DVD is about?  Wrong the only super bowls I have received in their eternity are the two Broncos' super bowls of the Super Bowl XXXII and Super Bowl XXXIII that came along with the 1977 AFC Championship Game in a three set entitled the Broncos 3 greatest games.

The Super Bowl was the greatest game of the season. It was better than the Giant Super Bowl victories in 1986 and 1990 and is one of, if not the greatest, Super Bowls ever played.This dvd has segments on all the games played during the season as well as all the playoff games. In addition two of the extras include a game of the week segment on the playoff games against Dallas and Green Bay but no game of the week for the Super Bowl.I would have gladly done away with all the extras to have a full half hour or hour on the actual plays of the Super Bowl. My dvd player showed the section with the game coverage of the Super Bowl lasting approximately fifteen minutes. There were extra segments commenting on the game but I wanted to see more of the game.Part of the Super Bowl game coverage shows the game officials commenting on the game. This is nice but considering the time devoted to the Super Bowl it takes away from the actual game coverage.The dvd showed only five plays of the Giant's game winning drive. The plays are as follows: a near interception by New England, the fourth down conversion by the Giants that kept the drive alive, a brief clip of a sack of Manning, the amazing pass by Manning to Tyree and the final pass to Burress.The dvd then has extras including the half time show, post game interviews and analysis and segments on Manning, Coughlin, Kiwanuka and Strahan. All this is nice but I want to see more of one of the greatest Super Bowls ever.I heard that a dvd focusing on the Super Bowl may come out later in the year. I don't know if this is true. I hope it is. I will buy it in a second.(I just purchased the Giants' Road to the Superbowl dvd. It was worth the wait.

1137557,AQYSBQWES50MO,B0012IX3CQ,VWC,"[15, 20]","I'm not even a Giants fan but I would buy this DVD just to see alternate coverage of the defeat of the Patriots.  The Patriots franchise is a disgrace.  The fumble in the snow against the Raiders, the holding against the Rams in the Super Bowl, the cheating for years, the arrogance, the poor sportsmanship by their coach, BARELY winning each Super Bowl...yet, they're considered a DYNASTY.  Tom Brady has had the luxury of having the best offensive line in football for practically his entire career.  He was badly exposed and humbled against the Giants.  For every NFL fan who was about ready to puke every time they acknowledged Brady as the best ever, for every fan who had to listen to the talk about the 2007 Patriots being the best team ever, BOY, IS THIS DVD FOR YOU!  The Patriots finally got what was coming to them.  Unfortunately, they can't strip away all of their other Super Bowl titles in which they cheated.  And too bad the evidence was thrown out so quickly.  By the way, it was also a great victory over Favre in the NFC Championship.  He is another overrated QB who, if you think about it, other than being blessed to never be injured, really has done nothing in a decade.  Well, he IS the all-time interception leader.
