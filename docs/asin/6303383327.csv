Although I'm 17 years old, I still find this movie very enjoyable. It's about this geeky kid named Mudd (Jonathan Jackson) and three other kids (including Andrew Keegan), who come up with a plan to make their summer vacation the most fun vacation they've ever had - by creating their own camp called Camp Nowhere, with the help of an ex-drama teacher named Dennis (Christopher Lloyd). The camp was just supposed to be for the four of them, but then a bunch of other kids find out about the camp and they end up going to the camp, too! It's a wild and crazy summer for the kids with no rules or responsible adults. The kids get to do whatever they want, while their parents think they are away at computer camp, weight-loss camp, military camp, or drama camp! And of course, they've got megabucks to spend on whatever they want from the money their parents paid for the camps. But then their parents come for parents' day and they have to prove to them that they are really at the camps their parents thought they were!This movie is very hilarious and fun to watch with your friends. You can watch it over and over again without ever getting tired of it. With an allstar cast including Jonathan Jackson, Andrew Keegan, and Christopher Lloyd and a great script, how could you go wrong? If you haven't seen CAMP NOWHERE, I definitely recommend that you do.
