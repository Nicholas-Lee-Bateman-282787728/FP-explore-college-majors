I got it because I have another work out video by Michelle which I love and it is my all-time favorite, I thought this one would be as good, but it is not.  The pilates section is too short and it does not have enough sets, I have to pause it in order to get more repetitions in and actually get a work out.  Just like another reviewer said, it is also hard to do the work out and view the dvd at the same time, I guess it'll take a few times to memorize the move and then you can do it without watching. I didn't care for the yoga, I don't feel anything, not even stretching my muscles. The ballet is ok, but I've never done any dancing of any sort, so I wouldn't know if it's good or not, and it's a bit challenging to stand on my toes at times, but not enough to feel like my calfs are getting a work out.",2,Not so great,1205798400,"03 18, 2008",2008,842,"['was', 'dissapointed', 'DVD', 'got', 'have', 'work', 'out', 'video', 'Michelle', 'love', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'thought', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'not', 'pilates', 'section', 'too', 'short', 'not', 'have', 'enough', 'sets', 'have', 'pause', 'order', 'get', 'more', 'repetitions', 'actually', 'get', 'work', 'out', 'Just', 'reviewer', 'said', 'also', 'hard', 'do', 'work', 'out', 'view', 'dvd', 'same', 'time', 'guess', ""'ll"", 'take', 'few', 'times', 'memorize', 'move', 'then', 'can', 'do', 'watching', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'yoga', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'anything', 'not', 'even', 'stretching', 'muscles', 'ballet', 'ok', ""'ve"", 'never', 'done', 'dancing', 'sort', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'good', 'not', 'bit', 'challenging', 'stand', 'toes', 'times', 'not', 'enough', 'feel', 'calfs', 'are', 'getting', 'work', 'out']",N/A
691167,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B00005YUR2,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[11, 11]","Breakthru Pilates Plus is a wonderful mix of several different exercise methods, with Pilates being only part of the workout.  The entire video is about 46 minutes long, and it's broken up into four sections as follows:Section 1:  Michelle Dozios leads this stretching segment, which consists mainly of yoga-type stretches, including some sun salutation variations.  About 8 minutes.Section 2:  Tracy York begins this segment, which focuses on Pilates.  The exercises performed here clearly are rooted in Pilates, yet they are modified from traditional Pilates matwork.  Some of moves are deceptively simple (e.g., leaning back to engage your abs and then punching to each side), but I could really feel the work in my abdominal area.  Following the lying abs work, you roll onto your side for some additional unique abs moves as well as Pilates side kick type moves.  A really challenging series containing plank moves combined with push-ups comes next; you will also do ""decellerated push-ups,"" a slower moving tricep pushup.  Michelle takes over to repeat the exercises on the other side as well as to do a second pushup series.  At 17 minutes, this is the longest section of the workout.Section 3:  This is the ballet-inspired section led by Michelle.  Using a chair for ballance, you will do simple plies, leg raises, and leg kicks, first on one side and then repeating on the other side.  These exercises were definitely tougher than they looked, and I found it difficult to emulate Michelle and Tracy's perfect form.  This section lasted about 12 minutes.Section 4:  This was the yoga segment, and it consisted of about 8 minutes of standing yoga poses, including warrior, side angle, chair, and standing forward bends.  Tracy leds this section, and she provides good instructions on alignment.  The workout ends rather abruptly with a very brief stretch at the end of this segment.I really enjoyed this workout; the wide variety combined with the segmented format to hold my interest, and because of this, I know that I won't easily tire of this video.  Michelle and Tracy were both good instructors who provided good cuing, and for many of the exercises, one of them shows a modified version.  They occasionally chatted back and forth, but not to the point of being annoying or disrupting the flow of the routine.  This is a perfect workout for intermediate exercises like myself who enjoy doing a wide variety of methods in a relatively short period of time.",5,Great variety of exercise methods!,1075939200,"02 5, 2004",2004,2468,"['Breakthru', 'Pilates', 'Plus', 'wonderful', 'mix', 'several', 'different', 'exercise', 'methods', 'Pilates', 'being', 'only', 'part', 'workout', 'entire', 'video', '46', 'minutes', 'long', 'broken', 'up', 'four', 'sections', 'Section', '1', 'Michelle', 'Dozios', 'stretching', 'segment', 'mainly', 'yoga-type', 'stretches', 'including', 'sun', 'salutation', 'variations', '8', 'minutes.Section', '2', 'Tracy', 'York', 'segment', 'Pilates', 'exercises', 'performed', 'here', 'clearly', 'are', 'rooted', 'Pilates', 'yet', 'are', 'modified', 'traditional', 'Pilates', 'matwork', 'moves', 'are', 'deceptively', 'simple', 'e.g.', 'leaning', 'back', 'engage', 'abs', 'then', 'punching', 'side', 'could', 'really', 'feel', 'work', 'abdominal', 'area', 'Following', 'lying', 'abs', 'work', 'roll', 'side', 'additional', 'unique', 'abs', 'moves', 'as', 'well', 'Pilates', 'side', 'kick', 'type', 'moves', 'really', 'challenging', 'series', 'containing', 'plank', 'moves', 'combined', 'push-ups', 'next', 'will', 'also', 'do', 'decellerated', 'push-ups', 'slower', 'moving', 'tricep', 'pushup', 'Michelle', 'repeat', 'exercises', 'other', 'side', 'as', 'well', 'do', 'second', 'pushup', 'series', '17', 'minutes', 'longest', 'section', 'workout.Section', '3', 'ballet-inspired', 'section', 'led', 'Michelle', 'Using', 'chair', 'ballance', 'will', 'do', 'simple', 'plies', 'leg', 'raises', 'leg', 'kicks', 'first', 'one', 'side', 'then', 'repeating', 'other', 'side', 'exercises', 'were', 'definitely', 'tougher', 'looked', 'found', 'difficult', 'emulate', 'Michelle', 'Tracy', 'perfect', 'form', 'section', 'lasted', '12', 'minutes.Section', '4', 'was', 'yoga', 'segment', 'consisted', '8', 'minutes', 'standing', 'yoga', 'poses', 'including', 'warrior', 'side', 'angle', 'chair', 'standing', 'forward', 'bends', 'Tracy', 'section', 'good', 'instructions', 'alignment', 'workout', 'rather', 'abruptly', 'very', 'brief', 'stretch', 'end', 'segment.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'workout', 'wide', 'variety', 'combined', 'segmented', 'format', 'hold', 'interest', 'know', 'wo', ""n't"", 'easily', 'tire', 'video', 'Michelle', 'Tracy', 'were', 'good', 'instructors', 'who', 'provided', 'good', 'cuing', 'many', 'exercises', 'one', 'modified', 'version', 'occasionally', 'chatted', 'back', 'forth', 'not', 'point', 'being', 'annoying', 'disrupting', 'flow', 'routine', 'perfect', 'workout', 'intermediate', 'exercises', 'who', 'enjoy', 'doing', 'wide', 'variety', 'methods', 'relatively', 'short', 'period', 'time']",N/A

I thought this would the perfect match to compliment my yoga regime I practiced. I love the pilates section. Incredible and easy to understand the hype on why pilates work. I actually wish they featured pilates a little more in the work out. The ballet was very fun and really did give a new perspective on ballerinas. In fact, the only complaint with the tape is the yoga section. I do not believe its give a first time yoga user a true perspective on what yoga really is about and can do for your body. I really did not enjoy the yoga section at all. But, for the pilates section and the ballet section alone. This tape is completely worth the investment.

691169,A3FGL6OJNBWABI,B00005YUR2,"Cikk ""cikk""","[76, 78]","I tried this yesterday for the first time and wouldn't recommend it for a beginner.  Collage rate it as intermediate/advanced - they're right.  I work our regularly, and have worked up to using Moira Stott's intermediate Pilates video regularly for the last couple of months, interspersed with (amongst others) Baron Baptiste's Soul of Strength and Power and Precision - All the Right Moves - Kathy Smith's Timesaver weights - J Kries Perfect Mix - So I am pretty fit - but cannot lower straight down from a plank - knees go down first.  That should give you an idea of my level!Well - this video has LOTS of pushups - including tricep pushups - with the elbows close in - I couldn't even do these on my knees.  Fine - something to work towards - but frustrating also!Anyway - it starts of with 8 mins ballet/yoga warmup - nice, flows.  And suitable for those who don't know anything about either of these regimes, as they don't take anything for granted - she doesn't even call a downward dog by its name!Next comes the Pilates-based floorwork - 18 minutes - as far as I know, none of this is classic Pilates floorwork, but it is very Pilates in feel - and tough, yes!Then 12 minutes of standing ballet - legwork - this is the easiest segment, but you will feel it if you do it properly - this time, they use the ballet terms - but explain them for non-ballerinas.  Good stuff.Lastly 9 minutes of classic yoga - warriors etc -  to keep toning while stretching out.  Also good. My only crit - why not another down dog to stretch out the calves even more after the ballet legwork?  But the warrior poses probably do the job, as my calves feel ok today.So - 47 minutes in all - 2 pleasant instructors who cue extremely well, while not talking down to us home exercisers - and who smile often (unlike Karen Voigt who I cannot take any more) but not too much - unlike J Kries who can look a bit forced.  This is a keeper, I recommend for those who have previous experience and are already quite strong.  And - to compare with one of my favourite fusion videos - All the Right Moves - this is shorter - 47 as opposed to 60 minutes - and the yoga is hatha - not power as in ATRM - and IMHO it flows better - although really I like the way ATRM leaves me feeling more than this - i.e. wrung out!  This is much less sweaty - which has its own advantages...... go for it!",5,Highly recommended,1019779200,"04 26, 2002",2002,2362,"['tried', 'yesterday', 'first', 'time', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'beginner', 'Collage', 'rate', 'intermediate/advanced', ""'re"", 'right', 'work', 'regularly', 'have', 'worked', 'up', 'using', 'Moira', 'Stott', 'intermediate', 'Pilates', 'video', 'regularly', 'last', 'couple', 'months', 'interspersed', 'amongst', 'others', 'Baron', 'Baptiste', 'Soul', 'Strength', 'Power', 'Precision', 'Right', 'Moves', 'Kathy', 'Smith', 'Timesaver', 'weights', 'J', 'Kries', 'Perfect', 'Mix', 'So', 'am', 'pretty', 'fit', 'can', 'not', 'lower', 'straight', 'down', 'plank', 'knees', 'go', 'down', 'first', 'should', 'give', 'idea', 'level', 'Well', 'video', 'LOTS', 'pushups', 'including', 'tricep', 'pushups', 'elbows', 'close', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'do', 'knees', 'Fine', 'something', 'work', 'towards', 'frustrating', 'also', 'Anyway', '8', 'mins', 'ballet/yoga', 'warmup', 'nice', 'suitable', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'regimes', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'anything', 'granted', ""n't"", 'even', 'call', 'downward', 'dog', 'name', 'Next', 'Pilates-based', 'floorwork', '18', 'minutes', 'as', 'far', 'know', 'none', 'classic', 'Pilates', 'floorwork', 'very', 'Pilates', 'feel', 'tough', 'yes', 'Then', '12', 'minutes', 'standing', 'ballet', 'legwork', 'easiest', 'segment', 'will', 'feel', 'do', 'properly', 'time', 'use', 'ballet', 'terms', 'explain', 'non-ballerinas', 'Good', 'stuff.Lastly', '9', 'minutes', 'classic', 'yoga', 'warriors', 'etc', 'keep', 'toning', 'stretching', 'out', 'Also', 'good', 'only', 'crit', 'why', 'not', 'down', 'dog', 'stretch', 'out', 'calves', 'even', 'more', 'ballet', 'legwork', 'warrior', 'poses', 'probably', 'do', 'job', 'calves', 'feel', 'ok', 'today.So', '47', 'minutes', '2', 'pleasant', 'instructors', 'who', 'cue', 'extremely', 'well', 'not', 'talking', 'home', 'exercisers', 'who', 'smile', 'often', 'Karen', 'Voigt', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'take', 'more', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'J', 'Kries', 'who', 'can', 'look', 'bit', 'forced', 'keeper', 'recommend', 'who', 'have', 'previous', 'experience', 'are', 'already', 'quite', 'strong', 'compare', 'one', 'favourite', 'fusion', 'videos', 'Right', 'Moves', 'shorter', '47', 'opposed', '60', 'minutes', 'yoga', 'hatha', 'not', 'power', 'ATRM', 'IMHO', 'better', 'really', 'like', 'way', 'ATRM', 'feeling', 'more', 'i.e', 'wrung', 'much', 'less', 'sweaty', 'own', 'advantages', 'go']",N/A
691170,A17TDSX354MP7Y,B00005YUR2,CPTScott,"[5, 5]","I've been doing Yoga daily for about 10 years and Pilates (which I do daily before Yoga) for the last year and a half.While I have taken many years of Yoga classes, these days my practice is totally at home and mostly with DVDs and VHS.I've used programs that have featured both of these instructors individually (Dozios: Pilates for Dummies and York: Quick Fix Total Mix) and really enjoyed both of their teaching styles. Ironically I always would confuse the two of them so I thought it was pretty cool that they teamed up for their ""Breakthru"" programs. I find both of their personalities to be very positive and uplifting without being phony or overly perky. They also have a natural chemistry together.I literally just finished doing this entire program and I'm thoroughly impressed. The combination of Pilates, Yoga and Ballet really puts your body through its paces. I like that it ends with the Yoga segment because it really helps your body get equilibrium from the intensity of the other segments. The Yoga segments isn't overly challenging but just enough to really finish off the workout. Also, I've got about 136 Media programs between the DVDs in my Yoga and Pilates collection and this program has really cool variations I've never seen before on any of my other programs.I would definitely not recommend this as a beginners workout because it would probably overwhelm someone unfamiliar to these disciplines or someone who is out of shape. It's probably best to have some experience w/ Pilates and Yoga beforehand. You don't need a huge amount of experience but I think one would benefit from learning the basics of Pilates from something like ""Stott Basics"" and it wouldn't hurt to have done something like Yoga Zone's ""Basics"" program either.The length of this workout certainly adds to its intensity but certainly one could break up the segments for different days. What I did is each section then take a few minutes in between to hydrate myself a little bit and rest before the next segment.The most intense segment for me was the Pilates, especially the pushup segments. I'm in really good shape and I lift weights in addition to all the years of Yoga and Pilates and yet I still found the pushup sequence to be really challenging. They go from slightly wider pushups to closer (like chaturanga style w/ elbows close to the body) doing them as negative and then end with Yoga type pushups with the elbows remaining close to the body.If I would compare this program to others, the ones I have that are closest to it are Jennifer Kries Target Specifics (although she uses hand weights in that, in this program you use body weight only but need a folding chair for the ballet section). Crunches Super Slimdown ""Pilates Yoga Blend"" isn't too far removed from it either. All three of these programs are about the same length and can be broken up into segments to be done on different sessions.Just a note. I'm a guy who can't dance to save my life and when I first got programs with these ballet type moves on them (several of Jennifer Kries' New Method programs have these types of moves) I was feeling it wasn't for me. Then I actually made myself do them and have noticed that I've made significant improvements in my strength and balance in those exercises. I'm just mentioning this because a lot of guys like me might feel that they wouldn't benefit from these types of movements. To my mind, there's no doubt that these exercises really can help one with learning to incorporate their body synergistically, helping strengthen the stabilizing muscles around the hips and core of the body. This is really important not only for any athletic activities but for life in general.I definitely would highly recommend this program it's well done in every way and I know I worked up a pretty good sweat from it!",5,York and Dozois: Breakthru Pilates Plus!,1167523200,"12 31, 2006",2006,3824,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', 'Yoga', 'daily', '10', 'years', 'Pilates', 'do', 'daily', 'Yoga', 'last', 'year', 'half.While', 'have', 'taken', 'many', 'years', 'Yoga', 'classes', 'days', 'practice', 'totally', 'home', 'mostly', 'DVDs', 'VHS.I', ""'ve"", 'used', 'programs', 'have', 'featured', 'instructors', 'individually', 'Dozios', 'Pilates', 'Dummies', 'York', 'Quick', 'Fix', 'Total', 'Mix', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'teaching', 'styles', 'Ironically', 'always', 'would', 'confuse', 'two', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'cool', 'teamed', 'up', 'Breakthru', 'programs', 'find', 'personalities', 'be', 'very', 'positive', 'uplifting', 'being', 'phony', 'overly', 'perky', 'also', 'have', 'natural', 'chemistry', 'together.I', 'literally', 'just', 'finished', 'doing', 'entire', 'program', ""'m"", 'thoroughly', 'impressed', 'combination', 'Pilates', 'Yoga', 'Ballet', 'really', 'body', 'paces', 'Yoga', 'segment', 'really', 'body', 'get', 'equilibrium', 'intensity', 'other', 'segments', 'Yoga', 'segments', ""n't"", 'overly', 'challenging', 'just', 'enough', 'really', 'finish', 'off', 'workout', 'Also', ""'ve"", 'got', '136', 'Media', 'programs', 'DVDs', 'Yoga', 'Pilates', 'collection', 'program', 'really', 'cool', 'variations', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'other', 'programs.I', 'would', 'definitely', 'not', 'recommend', 'beginners', 'would', 'probably', 'overwhelm', 'someone', 'unfamiliar', 'disciplines', 'someone', 'who', 'shape', 'probably', 'best', 'have', 'experience', 'w/', 'Pilates', 'Yoga', 'beforehand', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'huge', 'amount', 'experience', 'think', 'one', 'would', 'benefit', 'learning', 'basics', 'Pilates', 'something', 'Stott', 'Basics', 'would', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'have', 'done', 'something', 'Yoga', 'Zone', 'Basics', 'program', 'either.The', 'length', 'workout', 'certainly', 'intensity', 'certainly', 'one', 'could', 'break', 'up', 'segments', 'different', 'days', 'What', 'did', 'section', 'then', 'take', 'few', 'minutes', 'hydrate', 'little', 'bit', 'rest', 'next', 'segment.The', 'most', 'intense', 'segment', 'was', 'Pilates', 'especially', 'pushup', 'segments', ""'m"", 'really', 'good', 'shape', 'lift', 'weights', 'addition', 'years', 'Yoga', 'Pilates', 'yet', 'still', 'found', 'pushup', 'sequence', 'be', 'really', 'challenging', 'go', 'slightly', 'wider', 'pushups', 'closer', 'chaturanga', 'style', 'w/', 'close', 'body', 'doing', 'negative', 'then', 'end', 'Yoga', 'type', 'pushups', 'elbows', 'remaining', 'close', 'body.If', 'would', 'compare', 'program', 'others', 'ones', 'have', 'are', 'closest', 'are', 'Jennifer', 'Kries', 'Target', 'Specifics', 'hand', 'weights', 'program', 'use', 'body', 'weight', 'only', 'need', 'folding', 'chair', 'ballet', 'section', 'Crunches', 'Super', 'Slimdown', 'Pilates', 'Yoga', 'Blend', ""n't"", 'too', 'far', 'removed', 'three', 'programs', 'are', 'same', 'length', 'can', 'be', 'broken', 'up', 'segments', 'be', 'done', 'different', 'sessions.Just', 'note', ""'m"", 'guy', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'dance', 'save', 'life', 'when', 'first', 'got', 'programs', 'ballet', 'type', 'moves', 'several', 'Jennifer', 'Kries', 'New', 'Method', 'programs', 'have', 'types', 'moves', 'was', 'feeling', 'was', ""n't"", 'Then', 'actually', 'made', 'do', 'have', 'noticed', ""'ve"", 'made', 'significant', 'improvements', 'strength', 'balance', 'exercises', ""'m"", 'just', 'mentioning', 'lot', 'guys', 'might', 'feel', 'would', ""n't"", 'benefit', 'types', 'movements', 'mind', 'doubt', 'exercises', 'really', 'can', 'help', 'one', 'learning', 'incorporate', 'body', 'synergistically', 'helping', 'strengthen', 'stabilizing', 'muscles', 'hips', 'core', 'body', 'really', 'important', 'not', 'only', 'athletic', 'activities', 'life', 'general.I', 'definitely', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'program', 'well', 'done', 'way', 'know', 'worked', 'up', 'pretty', 'good', 'sweat']",N/A
