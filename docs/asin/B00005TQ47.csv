Hearing his songs played as a three-piece lends a simplicity to his songs that I really enjoy, making many of them sound almost &quot;unplugged.&quot;  The concert is a great mix of his older, classic songs with his more recent hits.  BA fans, like me, should enjoy this DVD...others certainly will not be disappointed!  This is a great addition to my concert DVDs - I am sure you will enjoy it, too.",4,Very Enjoyable Concert,1022716800,"05 30, 2002",2002,471,"['have', 'not', 'heard', 'BA', 'while', 'are', 'bit', 'shock', 'Hearing', 'songs', 'played', 'three-piece', 'simplicity', 'songs', 'really', 'enjoy', 'making', 'many', 'sound', 'almost', 'quot', 'unplugged.', 'quot', 'concert', 'great', 'mix', 'older', 'classic', 'songs', 'more', 'recent', 'hits', 'BA', 'fans', 'should', 'enjoy', 'DVD', 'others', 'certainly', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'great', 'addition', 'concert', 'DVDs', 'am', 'sure', 'will', 'enjoy', 'too']",N/A

You can be sure! the sound is hardly 5.1 the picture quality is not the best, but what is unbelievable is that Bryan Adams being the star he is, agreed to release this dvd. Do not expect good extra features. He is not playing the guitar, God what was he thinking when he decided to play the Bass instead?The Band reduced to 3 people why? A poor scenerio (pure white), no good shots, no exciting at all, the camera man was lost in the world focusing on the crowd and not in Bryan. Even if the songs are great (that's true) consumers and fans deserve a better deal in a dvd. This dvd is kind of boring. I already got rid of my copy. I was so disappointed.Technology is there why do not use it?The MTV unplugged version is better, but does not include all his greatest songs, unfortunately ""Live at Slane Castle"" has a better selection of Bryan's hits. But before buying it, rent it or borrow it from a friend so you can be sure what you will get.There was a dvd released in Japan with all Bryan best videos, but it was not 5.1 and just a few could get a copy. It can not be found anymore.Bryan we are waiting...We are sure you have much more to offer and you can give your fans a little extra and a true 5.1 or even better a dts dvd.",1,Do not say I didn't warn you,1033689600,"10 4, 2002",2002,1300,"['consider', 'fan', 'NOOO', 'dvd', 'not', 'what', 'expect', 'can', 'be', 'sure', 'sound', 'hardly', '5.1', 'picture', 'quality', 'not', 'best', 'what', 'unbelievable', 'Bryan', 'Adams', 'being', 'star', 'agreed', 'release', 'dvd', 'Do', 'not', 'expect', 'good', 'extra', 'features', 'not', 'playing', 'guitar', 'God', 'what', 'was', 'thinking', 'when', 'decided', 'play', 'Bass', 'instead', 'Band', 'reduced', '3', 'people', 'why', 'poor', 'scenerio', 'pure', 'white', 'good', 'shots', 'exciting', 'camera', 'man', 'was', 'lost', 'world', 'focusing', 'crowd', 'not', 'Bryan', 'Even', 'songs', 'are', 'great', 'true', 'consumers', 'fans', 'deserve', 'better', 'deal', 'dvd', 'dvd', 'kind', 'boring', 'already', 'got', 'rid', 'copy', 'was', 'so', 'disappointed.Technology', 'why', 'do', 'not', 'use', 'MTV', 'unplugged', 'version', 'better', 'not', 'include', 'greatest', 'songs', 'unfortunately', 'Live', 'Slane', 'Castle', 'better', 'selection', 'Bryan', 'hits', 'buying', 'rent', 'borrow', 'friend', 'can', 'be', 'sure', 'what', 'will', 'get.There', 'was', 'dvd', 'released', 'Japan', 'Bryan', 'best', 'videos', 'was', 'not', '5.1', 'just', 'few', 'could', 'get', 'copy', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'found', 'are', 'waiting', 'are', 'sure', 'have', 'much', 'more', 'offer', 'can', 'give', 'fans', 'little', 'extra', 'true', '5.1', 'even', 'better', 'dts', 'dvd']",N/A

Pick up a stadium next time, or release the wembley gig,in 1996!In My opinion the highlights of this dvd are: summer of 69, when you're gone, heaven, everything i do, don't give up and a stunning cloud n9.The 3 bonus tracks aren't included in the set list, cause there were some problems, like bryan forgetting the lyrics and such.A must have for any true rock lover!",4,Should've Been Earlier!,1041120000,"12 29, 2002",2002,1178,"['Huge', 'BAD', 'fan', 'am', ""'ve"", 'been', 'expecting', 'video', 'material', 'bryan', 'adams', 'first', 'saw', 'live', '1997.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'i', 'was', 'disappointed', 'dvd', 'release', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'much', 'better', 'especially', 'concerning', 'venue', '3', 'piece', 'band', 'guys', 'outfit', 'mean', 'seem', 'westlife', 'something', 'Bryan', 'Adams', 'was', 'born', 'rock', 'age', 'may', 'change', 'mind', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'fans', 'see', 'dressed', 'white', 'picture', 'quality', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'sometimes', 'little', 'unfocused', 'enjoy', 'shots', 'camera', 'crowd', 'bouncing', 'around.Bryan', 'adams', 'due', 'release', 'new', 'album', 'next', 'year', 'new', 'key', 'guitar', 'players', 'world', 'tour', 'already', 'being', 'scheduled', 'please', 'bryan', 'let', 'rock', 'old', 'days', 'Pick', 'up', 'stadium', 'next', 'time', 'release', 'wembley', 'gig', '1996', 'My', 'opinion', 'highlights', 'dvd', 'are', 'summer', '69', 'when', ""'re"", 'gone', 'heaven', 'everything', 'i', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'stunning', 'cloud', 'n9.The', '3', 'bonus', 'tracks', 'are', ""n't"", 'included', 'set', 'list', 'cause', 'were', 'problems', 'bryan', 'forgetting', 'lyrics', 'such.A', 'must', 'have', 'true', 'rock', 'lover']",N/A

Each of the songs he performs is fantastic except for &quot;When You're Gone.&quot; The only flaw in the song is the special guest Bryan brings out on stage, Mel. C. She performs in the recorded version of the song and she's great in it but something has happened to this woman since then. She looks terrible and her voice is even worse. Aside from that the rest of the concert is wonderful. I really don't understand why there are three bonus songs. Why weren't they just put in with the rest of the concert? Is it to make consumers think they are getting more bonus material than they actually are? The interview with Bryan and his band members is really good though.One word to Bryan: White isn't your color.",5,Great,1025395200,"06 30, 2002",2002,757,"['Bryan', 'Adams', 'great', 'show', 'DVD', 'songs', 'fantastic', 'quot', 'When', ""'re"", 'Gone.', 'quot', 'only', 'flaw', 'song', 'special', 'guest', 'Bryan', 'out', 'stage', 'Mel', 'C.', 'recorded', 'version', 'song', 'great', 'something', 'happened', 'woman', 'then', 'terrible', 'voice', 'even', 'worse', 'Aside', 'rest', 'concert', 'wonderful', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'are', 'three', 'songs', 'Why', 'were', ""n't"", 'just', 'put', 'rest', 'concert', 'make', 'consumers', 'think', 'are', 'getting', 'more', 'bonus', 'material', 'actually', 'are', 'interview', 'Bryan', 'band', 'members', 'really', 'good', 'though.One', 'word', 'Bryan', 'White', ""n't"", 'color']",N/A
