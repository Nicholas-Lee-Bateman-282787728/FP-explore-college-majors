Brandon and Kelly's relationship is offically over, he begins to date Susan, a journalism major and she has a stormy romance with Colin, who is a painter and drug addict. Kelly gets hooked on cocaine and goes to rehab and befriends a troubled girl named Tara who becomes obsessed with Kelly. Donna starts dating Joe, a football player with a heart condition. Claire and Steve continue to date, they are hilarious! Valerie dates David and Colin and so much more drama ensues with the return of Val's frenemie, Ginger. Great season, I highly recommend it!

1181086,A1PASRZ81DY9C,B001DHXT5C,Austin Somlo,"[1, 2]","Well...well...the more things change, the more they stay the same. It has finally begun: Beverly Hills 90210 is losing steam in a big way. I thought the first half of season six was good and decent, but man, the second half was quite boring for me. Ray overstayed his welcome as he became annoying to watch. Then, add Colin to the mix. His act had been extremely thin, and he should've disappeared twenty episodes earlier. To make matters worse, Joe Bradley became this boring flake around Donna, and I knew it: time to say ditto to him. Man, I never liked Susan in the first place, she acting all kooky and awkward on purpose. It was like watching a clone of Andrea but worse. Brandon shouldn't have gone out with Susan at all due to her fake elitism and sexism. Finally, to top it all off, Tara...whoa, that's a one serious basket case, and I even saw that coming from miles away. One piece of advice: never befriend anyone coming out of a substance abuse treatment center, especially if you are from Beverly Hills. It just doesn't work. Meanwhile, I thought the rekindled lost romance between Nat and Joan was a bit awkward to watch, especially for younger generations. It was just nauseating to watch; I mean, Jim and Cindy's is enough for once, but please no more than that for a series that's meant to be seen by teenagers. Anyway, let's evaluate the old characters as usual as well as some of the mainstay newcomers.Brandon: still at his old hypocrite self although he has mellowed out, and I've always gotten used to him, likeable or not. I loved the moment when his gambling problem had gotten out of hand. I was like, ""Yep, that's the old Brandon I know."" I thought his decision to date Susan was the biggest mistake in a while, and even bigger mistake was turning down that Boston Globe internship. Such, such a bad idea...never ever do that for a girl, ever. Emma Caulfield, playing as Susan, thankfully never returned again, and honestly, I just never liked her at all.Kelly: Poor Kelly Taylor, arguably the most likeable character of the show next to Steve Sanders, she went through a lot in season six. It's too bad that she got a raw deal many times. I really wished she dumped Colin after finding out that he did an older woman while dating Kelly. Ewww, gross. Blah, moving on....problem with Kelly, she needs some therapy to get her priorities straight especially after what happened with that New Evolution cult thing. It's something missing in her life, but she'll be a stronger woman after some insightful guidance.Donna: Same sweet girl, hardly a complaint about her. Yet still boring as ever.David: It's really impossible for me to say a lot about him, even after six seasons. He is just a boring dude.Steve: Easily the most likeable character of the show, still going strong, same old Steve. Nothing new. He certainly finds new ways to liven things up. The part showing that he has 2 brothers is probably the most farfetched of Season Six because if he had brothers, especially to babysit, it would have been made known way, way back in the beginning.Dylan: Poor kid, the pseudo-intellectual managed to make Season Six interesting as usual. Good ole Dylan, I knew that I could count on him. That was a pretty girl in Toni Marchette. To tell you the truth, I kinda miss him after he disappeared for most of the season, and he won't be back until Season Nine. I am looking forward to his return from hiatus.Cindy: It was nice to see her again one more time, but sadly, it felt weird.Andrea: Hi...bye. Entirely forgettable.Clare: Eh, I am sort of used to her, but I don't like her all that much. She was too snotty for me. One more season left of her, and she will be finally gone.Valerie: As beautiful as she is, she was really hard to like. I knew everything was all planned out beforehand to make sure Valerie gets what she wants. She was clearly responsible for Kelly's addiction to cocaine. You know that saying: ""Leave a candy bar in a room. Sooner or later, it's bound to be eaten."" And Valerie's soft spot for men such as Dylan and Colin, leaving her very vulnerable, was quite annoying to stand. To make matters worse, her two-year cold war with Kelly had grown greatly tiresome for me to watch. Time to end it and move on.Nat: Finally, Joe Tata got his name on the opening credits, way long overdue, but it's unfair that Jamie Walters got his so quickly at same time as Joe. Interestingly, Jamie and Luke Perry's were unceremoniously dropped from the opening credits after their sudden departures, and the opening video was re-edited to make sure none of it included them.Overall, the acting of the cast was quite good and stood the test of time. Of course, I am used to the characters, but I wished the others, the annoying ones, weren't so recurring. I've more or less enjoyed the episodes, but many of the topics were getting rehashed from past episodes. For example, David had a drug problem, and then Dylan had his problem. For some reason, Kelly became the third regular to have an old merry-go-around. That's getting a bit old, especially in how they've all managed to recover and bounce back to their old selves rather quickly. Right now, I am not all that looking forward to Season Seven because I am getting bored and tired of the series. However, I will keep watching and hoping for better stories and better characters.",4,Losing Steam in This One.

1181090,A2NKXXWUY2R41E,B001DHXT5C,"Fjireland ""fjireland""","[0, 0]","Season 6 of Beverly Hills 90210 is another enjoyable season of the show.Although the ratings dipped a fair bit this year, many fans like me stood by it and continued to tune in....The reason some people abandoned the show this year really was the shift of the show towards more soapy relationship based storylines as opposed to the past issue driven stories.If season 5 hinted that change was coming with Brenda out and Val in, season 6 truly delivered many changes...Andrea and Jessy were no more (their season 5 storyline of marital probs was dragged out long enough and really their was nowhere else to bring them),Cindy and Jim have left too... this allows Brandon in particluar to grow more... he's no longer checking with mom and dad about what to do when presented with a tricky situation. And with the gang hanging out more at the walsh house, there is a sense that the characters are really growing up.Dylan departs after episode 10, I for one was glad, the whole ""who killed my dad"" saga had gotten way to tedious, as was his on-off relationship with Kelly.. I knew when he returned in season 9, he wouldn't save the show from being axed... his character was exhausted by the end of season 4 if you ask me.Highlights of season 6 for me:Colin was an interesting addition and his leading Kelly astray, the writers did a good job on rounding out the character of Val more and showing softer, more vulnerable sides at times as well as continuing to rile Kelly with her bitchy antics too.It was good to see Brandon move on, susan was a great addition, her feisty/ feministic attitude made her fun to watch,Steve and Claire pairing up was a smart move, they really worked well as a couple.Donna dumping ray after the whole domestic abuse storyline was good to see, it seemed pointless to add Jamie Walters to the regular cast though when they were only writing him out.In the end, season 6 is another good season of the show, the quality of the show remains consistent if you ask me despite the changes in cast, producers and general tone of the show.  Looking forward to season 7, probably the last strong season of the show before the writers started to run out of ideas for the last seasons.",5,more great 90210 episodes,1231027200,"01 4, 2009",2009,2198,"['Season', '6', 'Beverly', 'Hills', '90210', 'enjoyable', 'season', 'show.Although', 'ratings', 'dipped', 'fair', 'bit', 'year', 'many', 'fans', 'stood', 'continued', 'tune', '.The', 'reason', 'people', 'abandoned', 'show', 'year', 'really', 'was', 'shift', 'show', 'more', 'soapy', 'relationship', 'based', 'storylines', 'opposed', 'past', 'issue', 'driven', 'stories.If', 'season', '5', 'hinted', 'change', 'was', 'coming', 'Brenda', 'Val', 'season', '6', 'truly', 'delivered', 'many', 'changes', 'Andrea', 'Jessy', 'were', 'more', 'season', '5', 'storyline', 'marital', 'probs', 'was', 'dragged', 'out', 'long', 'enough', 'really', 'was', 'nowhere', 'else', 'bring', 'Cindy', 'Jim', 'have', 'left', 'too', 'Brandon', 'particluar', 'grow', 'more', 'no', 'longer', 'checking', 'mom', 'dad', 'what', 'do', 'when', 'presented', 'tricky', 'situation', 'gang', 'hanging', 'out', 'more', 'walsh', 'house', 'sense', 'characters', 'are', 'really', 'growing', 'up.Dylan', 'departs', 'episode', '10', 'one', 'was', 'glad', 'whole', 'who', 'killed', 'dad', 'saga', 'had', 'gotten', 'way', 'tedious', 'was', 'on-off', 'relationship', 'Kelly..', 'knew', 'when', 'returned', 'season', '9', 'would', ""n't"", 'save', 'show', 'being', 'axed', 'character', 'was', 'exhausted', 'end', 'season', '4', 'ask', 'me.Highlights', 'season', '6', 'Colin', 'was', 'interesting', 'addition', 'leading', 'Kelly', 'astray', 'writers', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'rounding', 'out', 'character', 'Val', 'more', 'showing', 'softer', 'more', 'vulnerable', 'sides', 'times', 'as', 'well', 'continuing', 'rile', 'Kelly', 'bitchy', 'antics', 'too.It', 'was', 'good', 'see', 'Brandon', 'move', 'susan', 'was', 'great', 'addition', 'feisty/', 'feministic', 'attitude', 'made', 'fun', 'watch', 'Steve', 'Claire', 'pairing', 'up', 'was', 'smart', 'move', 'really', 'worked', 'well', 'couple.Donna', 'dumping', 'ray', 'whole', 'domestic', 'abuse', 'storyline', 'was', 'good', 'see', 'seemed', 'pointless', 'add', 'Jamie', 'Walters', 'regular', 'cast', 'when', 'were', 'only', 'writing', 'end', 'season', '6', 'good', 'season', 'show', 'quality', 'show', 'consistent', 'ask', 'changes', 'cast', 'producers', 'general', 'tone', 'show', 'Looking', 'forward', 'season', '7', 'probably', 'last', 'strong', 'season', 'show', 'writers', 'started', 'run', 'out', 'ideas', 'last', 'seasons']","Beverly Hills, 90210: Season 6"

It's great seeing these episodes after so many years. The music replacement seems hardly noticable to me. Any place where the music absolutley must be included (like when a band appears) it's been kept.The characters and storylines are what orginally drew me to this show and and that's what I continue to enjoy about it. The music playing in the background isn't essential to the stories or characters. I'm just glad to see the show getting steadily released and look forward to hopefully owning the whole series eventually. As far as the season itself the first ten episodes alone (the Dylan-Marchette story) make this set worth the buy. Then there's barely time to catch your breath as Kelly Taylor gets put through the wringer. The show also benefits immensly from last season's addition on Tiffani Thiesen as Valerie Malone. While Valerie continues to scheme we also see there's more to her this season. She really comes into her own this season and moves beyond the shadow of being Shannon Doherty/Brenda's replacement.Long story short if you were a fan of the show during it's original run you'll want to add this to your collection.,4,Still fun & addictive,1227830400,"11 28, 2008",2008,1234,"['bought', 'Tuesday', 'am', 'now', 'middle', 'enjoying', 'Thankgiving', 'weekend', 'marathon', 'great', 'seeing', 'episodes', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'music', 'replacement', 'hardly', 'noticable', 'place', 'where', 'music', 'absolutley', 'must', 'be', 'included', 'when', 'band', 'been', 'kept.The', 'characters', 'storylines', 'are', 'what', 'orginally', 'drew', 'show', 'what', 'continue', 'enjoy', 'music', 'playing', 'background', ""n't"", 'essential', 'stories', 'characters', ""'m"", 'just', 'glad', 'see', 'show', 'getting', 'steadily', 'released', 'look', 'forward', 'hopefully', 'owning', 'whole', 'series', 'eventually', 'As', 'far', 'season', 'first', 'ten', 'episodes', 'alone', 'Dylan-Marchette', 'story', 'make', 'set', 'buy', 'Then', 'barely', 'time', 'catch', 'breath', 'Kelly', 'Taylor', 'put', 'wringer', 'show', 'also', 'benefits', 'immensly', 'last', 'season', 'addition', 'Tiffani', 'Thiesen', 'Valerie', 'Malone', 'Valerie', 'scheme', 'also', 'see', 'more', 'season', 'really', 'own', 'season', 'moves', 'shadow', 'being', 'Shannon', 'Doherty/Brenda', 'replacement.Long', 'story', 'short', 'were', 'fan', 'show', 'original', 'run', ""'ll"", 'want', 'add', 'collection']","Beverly Hills, 90210: Season 6"
