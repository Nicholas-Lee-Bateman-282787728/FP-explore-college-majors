196082,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,555528988X,Annie Van Auken,"[1, 1]","This GOODTIMES videotape is dubbed at LP speed and doesn't have a HiFi audio track, thus sound and picture quality are somewhat limited..Garson Kanin, who wrote a stageplay that Judy Holliday also appeared in (""Born Yesterday""), created IT SHOULD HAPPEN TO YOU after suggesting to wife Ruth Gordon that he would put her name on a Manhattan billboard.In director George Cukor's enduring comedy, Judy is in top form as Gladys Glover, a girl who moves to NYC from upstate Binghamton in her quest to rise above the crowd and become a celebrity.An off-hand remark from filmmaker friend Pete Shepherd (Jack Lemmon is his screen debut) gives Gladys the wild idea of advertising her name on a giant Columbus Circle billboard, one that's usually rented to Evan Adams III's soap company.Adams (Lawford) swaps six smaller signs in different locations for the use of this one and Miss Glover's quest for notoriety is soon realized: she becomes the celebrity of the moment. Along the way however, Pete decides to give up on pursuing a romance with Gladys..(This film was also John Saxon's screen debut, in a cameo as a boy watching Judy's argument in the park.).Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.(7.1) It Should Happen to You (1954) - Judy Holliday/Peter Lawford/Jack Lemmon/Michael O'Shea/Connie Gilchrist/Whit Bissell/Constance Bennett/Ilke Chase/Wendy Barrie (uncredited: Heywood Hale Broun/Chick Chandler/Art Gilmore/Frank Nelson/John Saxon)",5,It happened to her!,1318636800,"10 15, 2011",2011,1472,"['GOODTIMES', 'videotape', 'dubbed', 'LP', 'speed', ""n't"", 'have', 'HiFi', 'audio', 'track', 'thus', 'sound', 'picture', 'quality', 'are', 'somewhat', 'limited..Garson', 'Kanin', 'who', 'wrote', 'stageplay', 'Judy', 'Holliday', 'also', 'appeared', 'Born', 'Yesterday', 'created', 'IT', 'SHOULD', 'HAPPEN', 'TO', 'YOU', 'suggesting', 'wife', 'Ruth', 'Gordon', 'would', 'put', 'name', 'Manhattan', 'billboard.In', 'director', 'George', 'Cukor', 'enduring', 'comedy', 'Judy', 'top', 'form', 'Gladys', 'Glover', 'girl', 'who', 'NYC', 'upstate', 'Binghamton', 'quest', 'rise', 'crowd', 'become', 'celebrity.An', 'off-hand', 'remark', 'filmmaker', 'friend', 'Pete', 'Shepherd', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'screen', 'debut', 'Gladys', 'wild', 'idea', 'advertising', 'name', 'giant', 'Columbus', 'Circle', 'billboard', 'one', 'usually', 'rented', 'Evan', 'Adams', 'III', 'soap', 'company.Adams', 'Lawford', 'six', 'smaller', 'signs', 'different', 'locations', 'use', 'one', 'Miss', 'Glover', 'quest', 'notoriety', 'soon', 'realized', 'celebrity', 'moment', 'way', 'however', 'Pete', 'give', 'up', 'pursuing', 'romance', 'Gladys..', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'John', 'Saxon', 'screen', 'debut', 'cameo', 'boy', 'watching', 'Judy', 'argument', 'park', '.Parenthetical', 'number', 'preceding', 'title', '1', '10', 'IMDb', 'viewer', 'poll', 'rating', '7.1', 'Should', 'Happen', '1954', 'Judy', 'Holliday/Peter', 'Lawford/Jack', 'Lemmon/Michael', ""O'Shea/Connie"", 'Gilchrist/Whit', 'Bissell/Constance', 'Bennett/Ilke', 'Chase/Wendy', 'Barrie', 'uncredited', 'Heywood', 'Hale', 'Broun/Chick', 'Chandler/Art', 'Gilmore/Frank', 'Nelson/John', 'Saxon']",N/A

196084,A2HVL790PBWYTU,555528988X,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 2]","One of the darn shames in cinema is that Judy Holliday didn't make more movies. Whatever you call it - a presence, sheer talent, that ""it"" factor, whatever - she had it, oozed with it. Judy Holliday was never less than vibrant. She always exuded that sense of fun and a warm accessibility. If she was ever half like that in real life, man, she must've been a joy to be around. IT SHOULD HAPPEN TO YOU (1954) ties withBells Are Ringing(1960) as my favorite Holliday picture. It's the first movie I saw with her in it. She leaves an even greater impression than does Jack Lemmon who here makes his feature film debut (he gets third billing).A pensive Gladys Glover (Holliday) strolls across Central Park, shoes off. When she gets in a spat with some guy in the park, she attracts a curious Peter Sheppard (Lemmon), him what shoots documentaries for a living, and they get to chatting. Gladys has just been fired from her job of modeling girdles. Right now, less than two years in the Big Apple, she's second-guessing herself. She tells Pete that she'll probably have to go back home to a career in the local shoe factory (it's what everyone in her home town does).Pete dispenses a few encouraging words and they amicably part ways. So here's mopey Gladys Glover staring out into the distance, and she glimpses a billboard overlooking Columbus Circle and she notes the ""This space for fent"" sign. It's not certain whether Gladys Glover is always so impetuous but, on impulse, she decides to rent out that space for three months, to put her name, just her name, on that billboard. See, she came to NYC to make a name for herself.Talk about your giant-sized ego strokes. The ball starts rolling when an ad agency covets that very same billboard and the agency's owner, Evan Adams III (Peter Lawford), woos Gladys for that spot. The agency suits believe this to be an easy coaxing job. ""After all,"" one suit reasons, ""nobody hires display space just to put their name on it."" Wrong, suit guy! Gladys stands fast.It's not too long before all of Manhattan is speculating about Gladys Glover or her name, anyway. ""Who or what is Gladys Glover?"" Why, she gets around more than Kilroy. IT SHOULD HAPPEN TO YOU is a delightful film. It's a whimsical romantic comedy showcasing a wonderfully offbeat premise and a likable pair in Holliday and in Lemmon. It's got something to say about the fickle, mercurial nature of fame and of celebrity, as well as the image of the average American girl (""That's what you men don't seem to realize, that the average American girl IS unusual.""). The teeming masses are eventually acquainted with Gladys Glover the face, not only the name. Throughout her character arc, Judy Holliday remains immensely likable and is very funny in several screwball bits. And Jack Lemmon matches her each step of the way. As you may intuit, Gladys and Pete's interplay doesn't stop at the park. Pete is practical-minded and a grounded kind of fella. He's pretty sore at how Gladys' self-promoting behavior has spiraled out of control. And as notoriety gets to Gladys' head, she's faced with some tough choices. How will it all turn out? And where does that suave ad agency owner factor into all this? Keep an eye out for cameos by Constance Bennett and Wendy Barrie and for Holliday and Lemmon's occasionally breaking out into a harmonious duet of ""Why Shouldn't We Fall In Love?"" And why shouldn't they fall in love? Well, take a gander atPHFFFT!(1954) which re-teams them two.",5,"""Who or what is Gladys Glover?""",1383004800,"10 29, 2013",2013,3483,"['One', 'darn', 'shames', 'cinema', 'Judy', 'Holliday', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'more', 'movies', 'call', 'presence', 'sheer', 'talent', 'factor', 'had', 'oozed', 'Judy', 'Holliday', 'was', 'never', 'less', 'vibrant', 'always', 'exuded', 'sense', 'fun', 'warm', 'accessibility', 'was', 'ever', 'half', 'real', 'life', 'man', 'must', ""'ve"", 'been', 'joy', 'be', 'around', 'IT', 'SHOULD', 'HAPPEN', 'TO', 'YOU', '1954', 'ties', 'withBells', 'Are', 'Ringing', '1960', 'favorite', 'Holliday', 'picture', 'first', 'movie', 'saw', 'even', 'greater', 'impression', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'who', 'here', 'feature', 'film', 'debut', 'third', 'billing', '.A', 'pensive', 'Gladys', 'Glover', 'Holliday', 'Central', 'Park', 'off', 'When', 'spat', 'guy', 'park', 'curious', 'Peter', 'Sheppard', 'Lemmon', 'what', 'shoots', 'documentaries', 'living', 'get', 'chatting', 'Gladys', 'just', 'been', 'fired', 'job', 'modeling', 'girdles', 'Right', 'now', 'less', 'two', 'years', 'Big', 'Apple', 'second-guessing', 'herself', 'Pete', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'have', 'go', 'back', 'home', 'career', 'local', 'shoe', 'factory', 'what', 'everyone', 'home', 'town', '.Pete', 'few', 'encouraging', 'words', 'amicably', 'part', 'ways', 'So', 'here', 'mopey', 'Gladys', 'Glover', 'staring', 'out', 'distance', 'billboard', 'overlooking', 'Columbus', 'Circle', 'space', 'fent', 'sign', 'not', 'certain', 'Gladys', 'Glover', 'always', 'so', 'impetuous', 'impulse', 'rent', 'out', 'space', 'three', 'months', 'put', 'name', 'just', 'name', 'billboard', 'See', 'came', 'NYC', 'make', 'name', 'herself.Talk', 'giant-sized', 'ego', 'strokes', 'ball', 'rolling', 'when', 'ad', 'agency', 'covets', 'very', 'same', 'billboard', 'agency', 'owner', 'Evan', 'Adams', 'III', 'Peter', 'Lawford', 'woos', 'Gladys', 'spot', 'agency', 'suits', 'believe', 'be', 'easy', 'coaxing', 'job', 'one', 'suit', 'reasons', 'nobody', 'display', 'space', 'just', 'put', 'name', 'Wrong', 'suit', 'guy', 'Gladys', 'fast.It', 'not', 'too', 'long', 'Manhattan', 'speculating', 'Gladys', 'Glover', 'name', 'anyway', 'Who', 'what', 'Gladys', 'Glover', 'Why', 'around', 'more', 'Kilroy', 'IT', 'SHOULD', 'HAPPEN', 'TO', 'YOU', 'delightful', 'film', 'whimsical', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'showcasing', 'wonderfully', 'offbeat', 'premise', 'likable', 'pair', 'Holliday', 'Lemmon', 'got', 'something', 'say', 'fickle', 'mercurial', 'nature', 'fame', 'celebrity', 'as', 'well', 'image', 'average', 'American', 'girl', 'what', 'men', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'realize', 'average', 'American', 'girl', 'unusual.', 'teeming', 'masses', 'are', 'eventually', 'acquainted', 'Gladys', 'Glover', 'face', 'not', 'only', 'name', 'character', 'arc', 'Judy', 'Holliday', 'immensely', 'likable', 'very', 'funny', 'several', 'screwball', 'bits', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'step', 'way', 'may', 'intuit', 'Gladys', 'Pete', 'interplay', ""n't"", 'stop', 'park', 'Pete', 'practical-minded', 'grounded', 'kind', 'fella', 'pretty', 'sore', 'how', 'Gladys', 'self-promoting', 'behavior', 'spiraled', 'control', 'notoriety', 'Gladys', 'head', 'faced', 'tough', 'choices', 'How', 'will', 'turn', 'out', 'where', 'suave', 'ad', 'agency', 'owner', 'factor', 'Keep', 'eye', 'out', 'cameos', 'Constance', 'Bennett', 'Wendy', 'Barrie', 'Holliday', 'Lemmon', 'occasionally', 'breaking', 'out', 'harmonious', 'duet', 'Why', 'Should', ""n't"", 'Fall', 'Love', 'why', 'should', ""n't"", 'fall', 'love', 'Well', 'take', 'gander', 'atPHFFFT', '1954', 're-teams', 'two']",N/A
