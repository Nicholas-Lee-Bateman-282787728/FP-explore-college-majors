Sometimes (unjustly) considered one of Leigh's lesser works it functions both as comedy and drama as it looks at the reunion of two friends from college several years after they have graduated and have been trying to find their niche in the world.  Told in a series of flashbacks and in present time it shows how he characters have grown over time while many of their vulnerabilities remain.A must for any and all Mike Leigh fans.",5,DVD is on the Way!!!,1119657600,"06 25, 2005",2005,581,"['Good', 'news', 'Mike', 'Leigh', 'fans', 'movie', 'now', 'scheduled', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'September', '6', '2005', 'according', 'Amazon', 'movie', 'excellent', 'one', 'Sometimes', 'unjustly', 'considered', 'one', 'Leigh', 'lesser', 'comedy', 'drama', 'reunion', 'two', 'friends', 'college', 'several', 'years', 'have', 'graduated', 'have', 'been', 'trying', 'find', 'niche', 'world', 'Told', 'series', 'flashbacks', 'present', 'time', 'how', 'have', 'grown', 'time', 'many', 'vulnerabilities', 'remain.A', 'must', 'Mike', 'Leigh', 'fans']",N/A
160113,A111JO8Q4DSUZH,0793970059,"D. Recio, SJ","[11, 11]","Mike Leigh's Career Girls (1997) draws viewers out of a steady diet of inconsequential plotting and formulaic storylines. Among the more fascinating stories involve protagonists who are also antagonists to themselves and others.Young psychology student, Annie (Lynda Steadman), seeks a place to live and answers an ad provided by Hannah (the late Katrin Cartlidge) and Claire (Kate Byers). Annie's flatmates, both reading English at the local Polytechnic school, play a divination game with an old Penguin copy of Bronte's Wuthering Heights to pass the time. Hannah, who appears to have numerous tics, possesses a rapier wit and a developed intuition while managing a stormy relationship with her alcoholic mother. Eventually, Hannah and Annie become close friends, finding between them a tighter bond as a result of shared experiences. The tough and brash Hannah protects the waif-like Annie, self-conscious as a result of a case of dermatitis, most apparent on her youthful visage.The story, told in a series of flashbacks, pushes viewers to enjoy the narrative ride rather than piecing together what happened when. As a result, Leigh establishes his ability to tell a sophisticated and poignant story about friendship, one that lasts because their affection for one another remains when the other is no longer present. Leigh does not dwell on a sentimental storyline largely because he is intelligent enough to suggest that friendships survive as a result of a history of common joys and genuine conflicts. Annie finds herself attracted to a man, Adrian Spinks (Joe Tucker), whom Hannah is dating. Ricky (Mark Benton) suffers from unrequited love when Annie turns him down and Hannah is quick to remind her that she has no cause to decline men because of their appearance. Leigh's meditation brings us back to Aristotle's argument on friendship, that friendship between two persons exists when both are equal and care for the other's well-being. The conversation in the Chinese restaurant is particularly moving.The DVD offers the original trailer, widescreen, and full screen format.",5,"Textured, Rich, and Poignant",1126310400,"09 10, 2005",2005,2087,"['Mike', 'Leigh', 'Career', 'Girls', '1997', 'viewers', 'steady', 'diet', 'inconsequential', 'plotting', 'formulaic', 'storylines', 'more', 'fascinating', 'stories', 'involve', 'protagonists', 'who', 'are', 'also', 'antagonists', 'others.Young', 'psychology', 'student', 'Annie', 'Lynda', 'Steadman', 'place', 'live', 'answers', 'ad', 'provided', 'Hannah', 'late', 'Katrin', 'Cartlidge', 'Claire', 'Kate', 'Byers', 'Annie', 'flatmates', 'reading', 'English', 'local', 'Polytechnic', 'school', 'play', 'divination', 'game', 'old', 'Penguin', 'copy', 'Bronte', 'Wuthering', 'Heights', 'pass', 'time', 'Hannah', 'who', 'have', 'numerous', 'tics', 'rapier', 'wit', 'developed', 'intuition', 'managing', 'stormy', 'relationship', 'alcoholic', 'mother', 'Eventually', 'Hannah', 'Annie', 'become', 'close', 'friends', 'finding', 'tighter', 'bond', 'result', 'shared', 'experiences', 'tough', 'brash', 'Hannah', 'waif-like', 'Annie', 'self-conscious', 'result', 'case', 'dermatitis', 'most', 'apparent', 'youthful', 'visage.The', 'story', 'told', 'series', 'flashbacks', 'viewers', 'enjoy', 'narrative', 'ride', 'rather', 'piecing', 'together', 'what', 'happened', 'when', 'result', 'Leigh', 'ability', 'tell', 'sophisticated', 'poignant', 'story', 'friendship', 'one', 'affection', 'one', 'when', 'other', 'longer', 'present', 'Leigh', 'not', 'dwell', 'sentimental', 'storyline', 'largely', 'intelligent', 'enough', 'suggest', 'friendships', 'survive', 'result', 'history', 'common', 'joys', 'genuine', 'conflicts', 'Annie', 'attracted', 'man', 'Adrian', 'Spinks', 'Joe', 'Tucker', 'whom', 'Hannah', 'dating', 'Ricky', 'Mark', 'Benton', 'suffers', 'unrequited', 'love', 'when', 'Annie', 'down', 'Hannah', 'quick', 'remind', 'cause', 'decline', 'men', 'appearance', 'Leigh', 'meditation', 'back', 'Aristotle', 'argument', 'friendship', 'friendship', 'two', 'persons', 'when', 'are', 'equal', 'care', 'other', 'well-being', 'conversation', 'Chinese', 'restaurant', 'particularly', 'moving.The', 'DVD', 'original', 'trailer', 'widescreen', 'full', 'screen', 'format']",N/A

I still think it is one of the most intelligent pieces of filmmaking I have ever seen.About 180 degrees away in its subject  matter, Career Girls affects me even more strongly. The idea that a couple  of college girl-chums might get together after a few odd years, is nothing  new. The film  effectively puts their relationship under a microscope,  in  two drastically different times of maturation, the college years, and the  10 or so years after. Under that scrutiny each will blossom, brilliantly,  through the short span of the film, much like a rose blooms in time-lapse  photography. It's a helluva notion. Leigh accomplishes it all  brilliantly.We have all seen buddy pictures, and Career Girls is no 48  Hours, or Lethal Weapon.

Gelwasser,"[16, 16]","Out of all of Mike Leigh's brilliant films, &quot;Career Girls is probably my favorite.This is a wonderful character study and look at the friendship of two English women during two different periods in their lives.In the film we meet Hannah (actress Katrin Cartlidge) and Annie (actress Lynda Steadman) former college roomates, who are having their first reunion in six years. These two are a regular pair of Mutt &amp; Jeffs. Hannah is tall, and thin with a caustic wit that is full of spit and vinegar. In contrast Annie is petite, shy and quite mousey in pesonality.As one of the characters is quoted as saying &quot;together they would make the perfect women&quot;.During the film we listen to their converstions as they travel about London remenicing, eating and even humorously go hunting for a flat. It is during all this, that the viewer is treated to flashbacks of how these now, smartly dressed, well coiffed, 'career gals', forged and created this important friendship in their relative youth. We are shown that back in the late eighties/early nineties they were a scruffy, punky looking pair, who went through thick and thin together.The movie shows us how in their outward appearance they might have changed  drastically, but on the inside they pretty much remain the same people (if not a bit more mature and cynically seasoned in nature).Actresses, Katrin Cartlidge and Lynda Steadman are marvelous in the two lead roles of this film.Both are totally believable playing these two interesting, yet imperfect women at different ages.Mike Leigh has written and directed a lovely drama/comedy, which really touches the heart as we get to know the characters(past &amp; present). The film also has a great soundtrack that features the '80's/90's pop music of The Cure.

On closer inspection though, ""Career Girls"" is equally as emotionally open and character driven as its predecessor of just one year before.""Career Girls"" is a film of recollection and remembrance: not always fond nor happy but like all recalled events and relationships one filled with equal parts pride, regret and embarrassment. Hannah ( an equally whacked out and serene performance by the now deceased Katrine Cartlidge) and Annie ( a twitchy, depressed yet also thoughtful and emotionally vulnerable performance by Lynda Steadman..."" a walking open wound"" as described by Hannah) meet again six years after college having been room mates during most of their college years. They were friends, confidants and shared early lives of hurt and despair. They never quite connected though as college room mates, mostly because they were damaged having been mortally wounded by childhood and therefore wary of all commitments. But now, they are mature seemingly successful women and as such recall events of the past with a sly understanding of each other and of the events that helped shape their current lives.Bittersweet is a word that comes to mind while I watched this movie again also having seen it in the theaters some 10 years ago. At a particularly poignant dinner in a Chinese Restaurant, Hannah and Annie reveal all the stuff that they both hated and loved about each other: a scene redolent with the truth of recalled events and emotions...""You're the only person who ever understood me,"" recalls Hannah about Annie.This is a special kind of bittersweet though: a bittersweet brewed by director Leigh with the grounds of regret and heartfelt recollection.

160118,A1IOM171PPQ2U8,0793970059,"""mr_nasty""","[5, 6]","Another brilliant film by the amazing Brit Mike Leigh . . his films go unseen by the public at large and unawarded by the A.M.P.A.S., yet they are  deeper and more profound than 90% of the movies Hollywood has released in  the past 10 years.  This film in particular (in conjunction with &quot;Life  is Sweet&quot;) demonstrates his ability to create incredibly lifelike and  original characters that both intrigue the viewer and tug at his heart.  Katrin Cartlidge is terrific (at first you'll think, weird) as the  unconventional, highly strung and free spirited Hannah (and was unjustly  passed up for an Oscar nod by the Academy) and Lynda Steadman is charming  as well as shy Annie; both women play college chums who reunite after  several years. Through several chance encounters, (including a  heartbreaking scene with another acquaintance, Ricky, played by Mark  Benton, and a jerk who threatened to tear them apart), they discover the  true strength of a friendship which had every reason to fall apart.  It's  reasonable to say you will never forget these characters, simple as they  are; none of them are like anyone you've ever seen on the screen before  (Leigh is a director who blantantly refuses to stereotype, reason enough  for him to be given every honor imaginable).

160120,A1AST89AHN17O7,0793970059,Omnes,"[0, 0]","One year after Mike Leigh won his Golden Palm for Secrets and Lies, and Katrin Cartlidge's incredible success with Breaking the Waves, the two of them, along with Lynda Steadman, did an excellent work in Career Girls. In it, two women (Hannah and Annie), who were roommates during their University studies, meet ten years later and spend the weekend together, all the while considering their career goals, their romantic lives, along with unexpected encounters with people from their students' past.Technically, it is fascinating to see how the shots during the University years are grainy , blue toned, and shot with hand-held cameras that give erratic movements, while the scenes in the present are bright, tame, gorgeous, and shot with a dolly camera. By this contrast of techniques, we get to see how the characters' perspectives of themselves were and have evolved over the years, but also how those memories have shaped them.In its storytelling, Leigh uses both flashbacks and lengthy dialogues to explain the characters' friendship during their studies, how they have evolved over the years, and events that have happened between each other, but outside of London. For instance, the characters talk about a holiday Hannah took at Annie's town and visited her friend's family along with the Bront Parsonage. This was a narrative technique I really liked because Mike Leigh didn't want to present everything about the girls' friendship. He seemed to encourage us to solve the missing pieces and to tie them up to the story. This allows a lot of creativity not only after what happens at the end, but also at what we are not told, such as Ricky's sad story, beautifully played by Mark Benton.In its Special Features, I was pleased to see that they put one of Mike Leigh's short film, called Short and Curlies, which he did with David Thewlis. Mixing both comedy with clear social context, it foreshadows the kind of work the two did in Mike Leigh's Naked, a very powerful work much more dramatic than Career Girls, but as efficient to watch.",5,Wonderful work from Mike Leigh,1338163200,"05 28, 2012",2012,2045,"['One', 'year', 'Mike', 'Leigh', 'won', 'Golden', 'Palm', 'Secrets', 'Lies', 'Katrin', 'Cartlidge', 'incredible', 'success', 'Breaking', 'Waves', 'two', 'Lynda', 'Steadman', 'did', 'excellent', 'work', 'Career', 'Girls', 'two', 'women', 'Hannah', 'Annie', 'who', 'were', 'roommates', 'University', 'studies', 'meet', 'ten', 'years', 'later', 'spend', 'weekend', 'together', 'considering', 'career', 'goals', 'romantic', 'lives', 'unexpected', 'encounters', 'people', 'students', 'past.Technically', 'fascinating', 'see', 'how', 'shots', 'University', 'years', 'are', 'grainy', 'blue', 'toned', 'shot', 'hand-held', 'cameras', 'give', 'erratic', 'movements', 'scenes', 'present', 'are', 'bright', 'tame', 'gorgeous', 'shot', 'dolly', 'camera', 'contrast', 'techniques', 'get', 'see', 'how', 'characters', 'perspectives', 'were', 'have', 'evolved', 'years', 'also', 'how', 'memories', 'have', 'shaped', 'them.In', 'storytelling', 'Leigh', 'flashbacks', 'lengthy', 'dialogues', 'explain', 'characters', 'friendship', 'studies', 'how', 'have', 'evolved', 'years', 'events', 'have', 'happened', 'other', 'London', 'instance', 'characters', 'talk', 'holiday', 'Hannah', 'took', 'Annie', 'town', 'visited', 'friend', 'family', 'Bront', 'Parsonage', 'was', 'narrative', 'technique', 'really', 'liked', 'Mike', 'Leigh', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'present', 'everything', 'girls', 'friendship', 'seemed', 'encourage', 'solve', 'missing', 'pieces', 'tie', 'up', 'story', 'lot', 'creativity', 'not', 'only', 'what', 'end', 'also', 'what', 'are', 'not', 'told', 'such', 'Ricky', 'sad', 'story', 'beautifully', 'played', 'Mark', 'Benton.In', 'Special', 'Features', 'was', 'pleased', 'see', 'put', 'one', 'Mike', 'Leigh', 'short', 'film', 'called', 'Short', 'Curlies', 'did', 'David', 'Thewlis', 'Mixing', 'comedy', 'clear', 'social', 'context', 'kind', 'work', 'two', 'did', 'Mike', 'Leigh', 'Naked', 'very', 'powerful', 'work', 'much', 'more', 'dramatic', 'Career', 'Girls', 'efficient', 'watch']",N/A
