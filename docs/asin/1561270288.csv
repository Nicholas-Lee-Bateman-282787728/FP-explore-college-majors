183059,A2TQ0SRDL86VPH,1561270288,Charles Richards,"[22, 22]","It is a shame that this video recording is the only visual representation of Michael Kaye's outstanding new edition of Offenbach's masterpiece currently available. As most are aware, this great (and I truly mean great) work was orphaned even before its birth, and since then has survived and been trundled out in mutilated versions, with much of Offenbach's original music cut and some numbers added by other hands. It is perhaps a tribute to the work's masterful score and fascinatingly literate libretto that, even in this form, it has gained immense popularity all over the world. The almost miraculous discoveries in the 80's and 90's of hundreds of pages of original Offenbach manuscript have now made it possible to finally re-construct, as best we can, what Offenbach's original intentions were, and has made it even more vital than ever that this work be seen not as some flouncy-bouncy fantasy opera with pretty tunes, but an immense music drama, on a par with Bizet's &quot;Carmen&quot; or Berlioz' &quot;Les Troyens&quot;.So then, why use Kaye's edition and then almost simultaneously de-construct it by truncating it (omitting half of the fourth and the entirety of the fifth acts)and pairing it with a production that counters Offenbach's vision at every step? While I'm not against a fresh look at a masterpiece, this production provides, in my opinion, nothing new to set one thinking, and seems to toss out all the main points of the work: the Muse's struggle for Hoffman's love, the sacrifice of mortal happiness for artistic immortality, the fact that &quot;love makes a man great, but tears make him immortal&quot;. This is all gone in this production. And the omission of Offenbach's original finale/apotheosis which had languished for almost a hundred years, completely unknown and unheard, is a crime.Not that I'm longing for the old-style, glitzy Met productions that saw the work as nothing more than a vehicle for an outing of star singers. It is time to re-think this work, but on Offenbach's terms. This work has suffered enough, it is time it was vindicated by a thoughtful production which explores its depth but does no dis-service to the original.The singing, however, is excellent; but if that's all that interests, I would suggest buying Nagano's recording of the opera which features many of the same cast members (with the welcome addition of Alagna as Hoffman) and presents the score in its entirety.",2,"Flawed, misguided production, but beautifully sung",1057881600,"07 11, 2003",2003,2436,"['shame', 'video', 'recording', 'only', 'visual', 'representation', 'Michael', 'Kaye', 'outstanding', 'new', 'edition', 'Offenbach', 'masterpiece', 'currently', 'available', 'most', 'are', 'aware', 'great', 'truly', 'mean', 'great', 'work', 'was', 'orphaned', 'even', 'birth', 'then', 'survived', 'been', 'trundled', 'out', 'mutilated', 'versions', 'much', 'Offenbach', 'original', 'music', 'cut', 'numbers', 'added', 'other', 'hands', 'perhaps', 'tribute', 'work', 'masterful', 'score', 'fascinatingly', 'literate', 'libretto', 'even', 'form', 'gained', 'immense', 'popularity', 'world', 'almost', 'miraculous', 'discoveries', '80', '90', ""'s"", 'hundreds', 'pages', 'original', 'Offenbach', 'manuscript', 'have', 'now', 'made', 'possible', 'finally', 're-construct', 'can', 'what', 'Offenbach', 'original', 'intentions', 'were', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'vital', 'ever', 'work', 'be', 'seen', 'not', 'flouncy-bouncy', 'fantasy', 'opera', 'pretty', 'tunes', 'immense', 'music', 'drama', 'par', 'Bizet', 'quot', 'Carmen', 'quot', 'Berlioz', 'quot', 'Les', 'Troyens', 'quot', 'then', 'why', 'use', 'Kaye', 'edition', 'then', 'almost', 'simultaneously', 'de-construct', 'truncating', 'omitting', 'half', 'fourth', 'entirety', 'fifth', 'acts', 'pairing', 'production', 'Offenbach', 'vision', 'step', ""'m"", 'not', 'fresh', 'look', 'masterpiece', 'production', 'opinion', 'nothing', 'new', 'set', 'one', 'thinking', 'toss', 'out', 'main', 'points', 'work', 'Muse', 'struggle', 'Hoffman', 'love', 'sacrifice', 'mortal', 'happiness', 'artistic', 'immortality', 'fact', 'quot', 'man', 'great', 'tears', 'make', 'immortal', 'quot', 'gone', 'production', 'omission', 'Offenbach', 'original', 'finale/apotheosis', 'had', 'languished', 'almost', 'hundred', 'years', 'completely', 'unknown', 'unheard', 'crime.Not', ""'m"", 'longing', 'old-style', 'glitzy', 'Met', 'productions', 'saw', 'work', 'nothing', 'more', 'vehicle', 'outing', 'star', 'singers', 'time', 're-think', 'work', 'Offenbach', 'terms', 'work', 'suffered', 'enough', 'time', 'was', 'vindicated', 'thoughtful', 'production', 'depth', 'dis-service', 'original.The', 'singing', 'however', 'excellent', 'interests', 'would', 'suggest', 'buying', 'Nagano', 'recording', 'opera', 'many', 'same', 'cast', 'members', 'welcome', 'addition', 'Alagna', 'Hoffman', 'score', 'entirety']",N/A

183061,A3BU6QT97HMF,1561270288,Joseph Hart,"[10, 11]","I was relieved (it's not so bizarre, grotesque as these other reviewers say) and mildly entertained.  Though the music is sublime, beautiful, this version makes even less sense than the original.  And if I hadn't known the original, I would have been hopelessly lost.  I was anyway.  It had some effective moments, particularly the draping of the corpse of Antonia's mother over Antonia's shoulders, in fact that whole story was wonderful I thought.  The story of Olympia who in this version was called a mechanical doll but was actually a girl in braces who when she first stood could barely walk was, frankly, I thought, in very poor taste.  Guilietta's part made no sense at all, it doesn't in the original to me either, but particularly not in this nonsense.  The stories are arranged Olympia, Antonia, Guilietta.  I won't give away the ending which I didn't understand anyway, I disliked the &quot;modern&quot; vocal sound effects that showed up towards the end, and the last words of the opera were inaudible, but fortunately there were subtitles, for all the good they did.  There were no sets at all, it ran 2 hours with no intermission, the costumes were contemporary dress, I have only the reviewers here to assure me that it all happened in a mental hospital, it was a trip, kept my interest, but like most &quot;modern art,&quot; was more of a curiosity than something to care about.  It had no feeling whatsoever.  But the music was grand.  By the way, the reviewer who lambasts the old (old is new to someone) and calls it in bad grammar and all lower case &quot;conservative,&quot; said nothing I remember about the opera at hand.  And no one in his right mind who knows me would ever call me &quot;conservative.&quot;  I don't even like to say the word.  But being old doesn't make a thing bad, just as being new doesn't ipso facto make it good.  Look at &quot;modern verse.&quot;  But like the lower case reviewer who relishes all things new and despises all things old, I also think art is about dead, but not through want of novelty.  Through want of genius.  But that always was rare.  And there has been a lot of it in Western music since Bach.  Oh.  I almost forgot.  I for one did not think the tenor who sang Hoffmann was that outstanding.  He was almost good enough, but I thought his loves were better.",3,Vaguely Hoffmann,1087689600,"06 20, 2004",2004,2328,"['was', 'relieved', 'not', 'so', 'bizarre', 'grotesque', 'other', 'reviewers', 'say', 'mildly', 'entertained', 'music', 'sublime', 'beautiful', 'version', 'even', 'less', 'sense', 'original', 'had', ""n't"", 'known', 'original', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'hopelessly', 'lost', 'was', 'anyway', 'had', 'effective', 'moments', 'particularly', 'draping', 'corpse', 'Antonia', 'mother', 'Antonia', 'shoulders', 'fact', 'whole', 'story', 'was', 'wonderful', 'thought', 'story', 'Olympia', 'who', 'version', 'was', 'called', 'mechanical', 'doll', 'was', 'actually', 'girl', 'braces', 'who', 'when', 'first', 'stood', 'could', 'barely', 'walk', 'was', 'frankly', 'thought', 'very', 'poor', 'taste', 'Guilietta', 'part', 'made', 'sense', ""n't"", 'original', 'either', 'particularly', 'not', 'nonsense', 'stories', 'are', 'arranged', 'Olympia', 'Antonia', 'Guilietta', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'ending', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'anyway', 'disliked', 'quot', 'modern', 'quot', 'vocal', 'sound', 'effects', 'showed', 'up', 'end', 'last', 'words', 'opera', 'were', 'inaudible', 'fortunately', 'were', 'subtitles', 'good', 'did', 'were', 'sets', 'ran', '2', 'hours', 'intermission', 'costumes', 'were', 'contemporary', 'dress', 'have', 'only', 'reviewers', 'here', 'assure', 'happened', 'mental', 'hospital', 'was', 'trip', 'kept', 'interest', 'most', 'quot', 'modern', 'art', 'quot', 'was', 'more', 'curiosity', 'something', 'care', 'had', 'feeling', 'whatsoever', 'music', 'was', 'grand', 'way', 'reviewer', 'who', 'old', 'old', 'new', 'someone', 'bad', 'grammar', 'lower', 'case', 'quot', 'conservative', 'quot', 'said', 'nothing', 'remember', 'opera', 'hand', 'one', 'right', 'mind', 'who', 'would', 'ever', 'call', 'quot', 'conservative.', 'quot', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'say', 'word', 'being', 'old', ""n't"", 'make', 'thing', 'bad', 'just', 'being', 'new', ""n't"", 'ipso', 'facto', 'make', 'good', 'Look', 'quot', 'modern', 'verse.', 'quot', 'lower', 'case', 'reviewer', 'who', 'things', 'new', 'things', 'old', 'also', 'think', 'art', 'dead', 'not', 'want', 'novelty', 'want', 'genius', 'always', 'was', 'rare', 'been', 'lot', 'Western', 'music', 'Bach', 'Oh', 'almost', 'forgot', 'one', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'tenor', 'who', 'sang', 'Hoffmann', 'was', 'outstanding', 'was', 'almost', 'good', 'enough', 'thought', 'loves', 'were', 'better']",N/A

This modernistic production which seems to be set in a madhouse bears only the faintest relationship to Les Contes D'Hoffman. (Hence the title Des Contes.)

Where were the visuals to go with the grand music? And where in this version of Offenbach is the charm, the beauty, and the humor that goes with this music?
