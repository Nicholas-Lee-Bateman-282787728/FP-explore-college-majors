I love the John Nash interviews in particular, but all the interviews are amazing. There are interviews of his family and colleagues. The pictures are very nice. I love this documentary because it is very informative and inspirational. This is definitely highly recommended.",5,An Inspirational Documentary,1376697600,"08 17, 2013",2013,354,"['amazing', 'documentary', 'part', 'where', 'denied', 'first', 'son', 'love', 'John', 'Nash', 'interviews', 'particular', 'interviews', 'are', 'amazing', 'are', 'interviews', 'family', 'colleagues', 'pictures', 'are', 'very', 'nice', 'love', 'documentary', 'very', 'informative', 'inspirational', 'definitely', 'highly', 'recommended']",American Experience: A Brilliant Madness
703762,A1S3C5OFU508P3,B000067S10,Charles Ashbacher,"[7, 7]","This tape is a remarkable success story on two separate levels. The first is the brilliance of the mathematics that led to John Nash earning a Nobel Prize in economics. In the second case, it is a triumph over an incredibly debilitating mental illness. When he was twenty, Nash did the work that would eventually win him the highest honor of science, and at the age of thirty he began suffering from mental illness. He believed that he was receiving communications from aliens, thought that he had been named Emperor of Antarctica and became obsessed with the idea of secret messages.This led to him being unable to do any mathematical work or teaching. His colleagues and his wife did what they could to help him and he was hospitalized for mental illness. The scenes of the therapy he received are unnerving. The sight of the patients undergoing insulin therapy and being turned into the human equivalent of a limp sponge is very disturbing. Fortunately, Nash suddenly found the will and strength to rise up from the depths of his illness. It took years, but he finally reached the point where he once again could become a functional member of the mathematical community and personally receive his award.Nash, his mathematical colleagues and their spouses, and his wife and children are all heavily interviewed on this tape. Nash in particular is brutally honest in his discussions, at one point saying, ""Madness can be an escape. In madness, I thought I was the most important person in the world."" His wife and child are also very candid, from her words, you know the depth of his wife's frustration as she tried to cope with John as his mind was going elsewhere.This is one of those tapes that will raise the following question in your mind. ""How much distance is there between genius and insanity?"" Clearly, at different points in his life, John Nash displayed both and this is an accurate chronicle of his personal journey between them. His life was the genesis for the award winning movie, ""A Beautiful Mind"", but I consider this tape to be better than the movie. For when you listen to the people who had to deal with Nash in his periods of insanity, it all becomes real to you. I strongly recommend this movie and will show it in my class if I ever again teach a course in the history of mathematics.",5,A tale of triumph in two extraordinary ways,1149292800,"06 3, 2006",2006,2310,"['tape', 'remarkable', 'success', 'story', 'two', 'separate', 'levels', 'first', 'brilliance', 'mathematics', 'led', 'John', 'Nash', 'earning', 'Nobel', 'Prize', 'economics', 'second', 'case', 'triumph', 'incredibly', 'debilitating', 'mental', 'illness', 'When', 'was', 'twenty', 'Nash', 'did', 'work', 'would', 'eventually', 'win', 'highest', 'honor', 'science', 'age', 'thirty', 'began', 'suffering', 'mental', 'illness', 'believed', 'was', 'receiving', 'communications', 'aliens', 'thought', 'had', 'been', 'named', 'Emperor', 'Antarctica', 'became', 'obsessed', 'idea', 'secret', 'messages.This', 'led', 'being', 'unable', 'do', 'mathematical', 'work', 'teaching', 'colleagues', 'wife', 'did', 'what', 'could', 'help', 'was', 'hospitalized', 'mental', 'illness', 'scenes', 'therapy', 'received', 'are', 'unnerving', 'sight', 'patients', 'undergoing', 'insulin', 'therapy', 'being', 'turned', 'human', 'equivalent', 'limp', 'sponge', 'very', 'disturbing', 'Fortunately', 'Nash', 'suddenly', 'found', 'will', 'strength', 'rise', 'up', 'depths', 'illness', 'took', 'years', 'finally', 'reached', 'point', 'where', 'once', 'again', 'could', 'become', 'functional', 'member', 'mathematical', 'community', 'personally', 'receive', 'award.Nash', 'mathematical', 'colleagues', 'spouses', 'wife', 'children', 'are', 'heavily', 'interviewed', 'tape', 'Nash', 'particular', 'brutally', 'honest', 'discussions', 'one', 'point', 'saying', 'Madness', 'can', 'be', 'escape', 'madness', 'thought', 'was', 'most', 'important', 'person', 'world', 'wife', 'child', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'candid', 'words', 'know', 'depth', 'wife', 'frustration', 'tried', 'cope', 'John', 'mind', 'was', 'going', 'elsewhere.This', 'one', 'tapes', 'will', 'raise', 'following', 'question', 'mind', 'How', 'much', 'distance', 'there', 'genius', 'insanity', 'Clearly', 'different', 'points', 'life', 'John', 'Nash', 'displayed', 'accurate', 'chronicle', 'personal', 'journey', 'life', 'was', 'genesis', 'award', 'winning', 'movie', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'consider', 'tape', 'be', 'better', 'movie', 'when', 'listen', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'deal', 'Nash', 'periods', 'insanity', 'real', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'will', 'show', 'class', 'ever', 'again', 'teach', 'course', 'history', 'mathematics']",American Experience: A Brilliant Madness

You will also admire his friends and family's dedication during his roughest periods.My only annoynance was the commentary.

703764,AC96YWEZDFAN,B000067S10,Grouchy  Smurf,"[0, 0]","Overall, I liked this documentary about John Nash's life. It's a nice contrast when you watch it after the movie. It appears that the movie did not entirely reflect the truth. Picture and sound quality were all good, and I enjoyed the interviews with actual colleagues, his sister, his son. I also found the psychiatrists' views helpful in understanding his illness and how he recovered. And of course, hearing John Nash himself talking about his career and illness was nice.I wish the documentary had explored/explained John Nash's work in more detail. I was expecting a more detailed exposition of his equilibrium concept, its significance for economics and how it was different from classical economics. I felt that the work got the short shrift, and his illness and personality got the most attention. I would have loved to hear him talk about his thought process and how he arrived at the idea and so on. All in all, I think it's a valuable addition to any DVD library and a nice complement to the movie, but I don't think it's the most educating, informative or arresting documentary I have seen.",4,"A brilliant madness, not so brilliant documentary",1362441600,"03 5, 2013",2013,1102,"['Overall', 'liked', 'documentary', 'John', 'Nash', 'life', 'nice', 'contrast', 'when', 'watch', 'movie', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'entirely', 'reflect', 'truth', 'Picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'were', 'good', 'enjoyed', 'interviews', 'actual', 'colleagues', 'sister', 'son', 'also', 'found', 'psychiatrists', 'views', 'helpful', 'understanding', 'illness', 'how', 'recovered', 'course', 'hearing', 'John', 'Nash', 'talking', 'career', 'illness', 'was', 'nice.I', 'wish', 'documentary', 'had', 'explored/explained', 'John', 'Nash', 'work', 'more', 'detail', 'was', 'expecting', 'more', 'detailed', 'exposition', 'equilibrium', 'concept', 'significance', 'economics', 'how', 'was', 'different', 'classical', 'economics', 'felt', 'work', 'got', 'short', 'shrift', 'illness', 'personality', 'got', 'most', 'attention', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'hear', 'talk', 'thought', 'process', 'how', 'arrived', 'idea', 'so', 'think', 'valuable', 'addition', 'DVD', 'library', 'nice', 'complement', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'most', 'educating', 'informative', 'arresting', 'documentary', 'have', 'seen']",American Experience: A Brilliant Madness

703766,AW1493ZQTQ2ET,B000067S10,Irfan A. Alvi,"[1, 1]","This documentary is basically a synopsis of Sylvia Nasar's ""Beautiful Mind"" book, and therefore offers a sensitive and accurate portrayal of John Nash and his remarkable life (remarkable in both uplifting and distressing ways).  The narrative of the documentary has a good flow, and we get interview excerpts with his wife, sister, colleagues, wives of colleagues, a childhood friend, Nasar, and Nash himself.  The result is that we learn about many things, including the ambition of genius, solidarity in the mathematics community, the impacts of mental illness, the satisfaction of redemption, and the value of hope.  We don't learn much about game theory itself, but that's OK, since it's a very technical subject which is probably best learned from other dedicated sources anyway.I highly recommend watching this documentary, and then following up with the book (or audiobook).  But I don't recommend watching the superficial and highly fictionalized ""Beautiful Mind"" movie, which I consider to be bordering on rubbish.",5,"Much better than the fictionalized ""Beautiful Mind"" movie",1316044800,"09 15, 2011",2011,1023,"['documentary', 'basically', 'synopsis', 'Sylvia', 'Nasar', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'book', 'therefore', 'sensitive', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'John', 'Nash', 'remarkable', 'life', 'remarkable', 'uplifting', 'distressing', 'ways', 'narrative', 'documentary', 'good', 'flow', 'get', 'interview', 'excerpts', 'wife', 'sister', 'colleagues', 'wives', 'colleagues', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Nasar', 'Nash', 'result', 'learn', 'many', 'things', 'including', 'ambition', 'genius', 'solidarity', 'mathematics', 'community', 'impacts', 'mental', 'illness', 'satisfaction', 'redemption', 'value', 'hope', 'do', ""n't"", 'learn', 'much', 'game', 'theory', 'OK', 'very', 'technical', 'subject', 'probably', 'best', 'learned', 'other', 'dedicated', 'sources', 'anyway.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'watching', 'documentary', 'then', 'following', 'up', 'book', 'audiobook', 'do', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'watching', 'superficial', 'highly', 'fictionalized', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'movie', 'consider', 'be', 'bordering', 'rubbish']",American Experience: A Brilliant Madness
