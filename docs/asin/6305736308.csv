475123,A38UHOCEKSUOSP,6305736308,"dominion_ruler ""Bryan""","[1, 1]","Ernie Reyes Jr. is amazing.  He is unbelievably athletic.  You may recall him from ""The Rundown"".  He was the guy in the jungle who fought the Rock and kicked his butt all over the place.  In The Ultimate Fight, what he makes up with in martial arts skill, he loses in making a good film.What ruined this movie was it's lack of any real plot and an absolutely horrible lead villain.  The acting wasn't good either and most of the charcaters were just uninteresting.  I was kind of bored throughout as pacing seemed very draggy.  But the villain, seriously he was just about the craziest freak I had ever seen.  Everyone calls him Hitler, and he dresses like a homosexual Hitler and must have some mental issues or be on drugs.  It was frustrating watching his role.There are 3 guys in this film that know how to put on a good show - Ernie Reyes Jr, his father (Ernie Reyes Sr.) and Shishir Inocalla.  When watching thse guys, you can tell they are real martial artists.  I just wish there had been some real plot to make their fights worth something more than just kind of showing off.  Kimo was the only villain in thie film I enjoyed, but he actually never impressed me too much.  The actor's name is also Kimo and he is a real life UFC legend.  I typically enjoy it when a good martial artist goes up against a UFC guy in these films.  Jet Li did it in Cradle 2 The Grave.  Tony Jaa did it in The Protector.  All 3 of the formentioned martial artists get their turn at the end of the film, but honestly, I was expecting more, especially out of Kimo.The only part of this movie I enjoyed was the last 15 minutes, simply because the entire 15 minutes was fighting.  The fights were ok, except whenever Reyes Jr. executed his athletic abilites in his kicks I was stunned.  He moves like a video game charcater and he is very fast.  This is about the only reason you will want to own this film, the rest will make you want to turn away in embarassment.",3,"ernie reyes jr. can kick, but he can't make a good movie",1193097600,"10 23, 2007",2007,1951,"['Ernie', 'Reyes', 'Jr.', 'amazing', 'unbelievably', 'athletic', 'may', 'recall', 'Rundown', 'was', 'guy', 'jungle', 'who', 'fought', 'Rock', 'kicked', 'butt', 'place', 'Ultimate', 'Fight', 'what', 'up', 'martial', 'arts', 'skill', 'making', 'good', 'film.What', 'ruined', 'movie', 'was', 'lack', 'real', 'plot', 'absolutely', 'horrible', 'lead', 'villain', 'acting', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'most', 'charcaters', 'were', 'just', 'uninteresting', 'was', 'kind', 'bored', 'pacing', 'seemed', 'very', 'draggy', 'villain', 'seriously', 'was', 'just', 'craziest', 'freak', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'Everyone', 'Hitler', 'homosexual', 'Hitler', 'must', 'have', 'mental', 'issues', 'be', 'drugs', 'was', 'frustrating', 'watching', 'role.There', 'are', '3', 'guys', 'film', 'how', 'put', 'good', 'show', 'Ernie', 'Reyes', 'Jr', 'father', 'Ernie', 'Reyes', 'Sr.', 'Shishir', 'Inocalla', 'When', 'watching', 'thse', 'guys', 'can', 'tell', 'are', 'real', 'martial', 'artists', 'just', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'real', 'plot', 'make', 'fights', 'something', 'more', 'just', 'kind', 'showing', 'off', 'Kimo', 'was', 'only', 'villain', 'thie', 'film', 'enjoyed', 'actually', 'never', 'impressed', 'too', 'much', 'actor', 'name', 'also', 'Kimo', 'real', 'life', 'UFC', 'legend', 'typically', 'enjoy', 'when', 'good', 'martial', 'artist', 'up', 'UFC', 'guy', 'films', 'Jet', 'Li', 'did', 'Cradle', '2', 'Grave', 'Tony', 'Jaa', 'did', 'Protector', '3', 'formentioned', 'martial', 'artists', 'get', 'turn', 'end', 'film', 'honestly', 'was', 'expecting', 'more', 'especially', 'Kimo.The', 'only', 'part', 'movie', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'last', '15', 'minutes', 'simply', 'entire', '15', 'minutes', 'was', 'fighting', 'fights', 'were', 'ok', 'whenever', 'Reyes', 'Jr.', 'executed', 'athletic', 'abilites', 'kicks', 'was', 'stunned', 'video', 'game', 'charcater', 'very', 'fast', 'only', 'reason', 'will', 'want', 'own', 'film', 'rest', 'will', 'make', 'want', 'turn', 'away', 'embarassment']",Ultimate Fight VHS

475125,AW7C9Y6DOYUFF,6305736308,"""kappachino""","[2, 3]","I was an Ernie Reyes Jr fan back when I was little, from watching Sidekicks (TV series), Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2, and Surf Ninjas. Well I knew this was written/produced/action directed by Ernie, 'The Process' as it was originally called was hyped up by the fans to be a good movie. I, along with other fans were expecting a good showcase of martial arts, being the players included both Ernie's and the West Coast Demo Team. Boy was I totally wrong. I go rent this movie for $4.00 and got basically get 90 minutes of fluff. Bad acting. I mean, BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD. Incomprehensible plot, incomprehensible all-around. Everything about this movie was bad. I'm not joking. I'm sorry that they spent $50,000 on the production of the movie, according to Ernie Jr's website. What a horrible waste of money. I say Ernie should hook up with Yuen Woo Ping and do some Hong Kong Cinema. Showcase his skills the way it was meant to. Seriously. All in all, please save your money and do not, I repeat, DO NOT rent or buy this movie!",1,Totally disappointing.

475127,A3QTB346UKG6TV,6305736308,Mantis,"[1, 1]","This flick is so bad it's hilarious.  I think it's safe to say that the majority of the humor was intentional.  Ernie Reyes Jr. (""The Rundown"", ""Surf Ninjas"") directs and stars as Jesse, a member of a group of martial artists who are at war with a group of drug dealers.  Or something like that.  The special features contain a trivia game about the film.  Though I had little recollection of what I had just viewed, I got all dozen-or-so questions right!Though the plot is essentially non-existent, I assume this was made as a showcase for the talented star, his father, and a couple of others.  Ernie Reyes Sr. has a great (and unexplained) fight with Shishir Inocalla in the dining room during mealtime.  Though most of the fights are ridiculous, they're still a lot better than many other B-films of the time.  Though the crazy flying kicks do go a bit overboard.  I'll also assume that Corin Nemec, who plays the flick's main bad guy, Hitler(?!?) owed someone a serious favor.I have been a major fan of Ernie Reyes Jr. since I was a kid.  This movie is probably what keeps him from getting better roles.  He is not the greatest actor in the world but he's much better than a lot of the goons that pass for action stars these days and with much better moves as well.  He is incredibly fast, agile, and crazy ripped.  How many sit-ups does this cat do in a day?  I would love to see what he could do with a real script, director, and choreographer.  The trailer for his current film, ""Red Canvas"" looked pretty cool.The DVD is full screened with decent picture quality.  It only has a few special features, including the trivia and optional Spanish subtitles.  I can't imagine that this would float a lot of people's boats, but not taken seriously it's silly and fun.  If you do like this type of thing act fast, as it's out of print.  2.5 stars.1998.  aka:  The Process",2,"I wish I could say that I hated this, but...",1235865600,"03 1, 2009",2009,1873,"['flick', 'so', 'bad', 'hilarious', 'think', 'safe', 'say', 'majority', 'humor', 'was', 'intentional', 'Ernie', 'Reyes', 'Jr.', 'Rundown', 'Surf', 'Ninjas', 'directs', 'stars', 'Jesse', 'member', 'group', 'martial', 'artists', 'who', 'are', 'war', 'group', 'drug', 'dealers', 'something', 'special', 'features', 'contain', 'trivia', 'game', 'film', 'had', 'little', 'recollection', 'what', 'had', 'just', 'viewed', 'got', 'dozen-or-so', 'questions', 'right', 'plot', 'essentially', 'non-existent', 'assume', 'was', 'made', 'showcase', 'talented', 'star', 'father', 'couple', 'others', 'Ernie', 'Reyes', 'Sr.', 'great', 'unexplained', 'fight', 'Shishir', 'Inocalla', 'dining', 'room', 'mealtime', 'most', 'fights', 'are', 'ridiculous', ""'re"", 'still', 'lot', 'better', 'many', 'other', 'B-films', 'time', 'crazy', 'flying', 'kicks', 'do', 'go', 'bit', 'overboard', ""'ll"", 'also', 'assume', 'Corin', 'Nemec', 'who', 'flick', 'main', 'bad', 'guy', 'Hitler', 'owed', 'someone', 'serious', 'favor.I', 'have', 'been', 'major', 'fan', 'Ernie', 'Reyes', 'Jr.', 'was', 'kid', 'movie', 'probably', 'what', 'getting', 'better', 'roles', 'not', 'greatest', 'actor', 'world', 'much', 'better', 'lot', 'goons', 'pass', 'action', 'stars', 'days', 'much', 'better', 'moves', 'as', 'well', 'incredibly', 'fast', 'agile', 'crazy', 'ripped', 'How', 'many', 'sit-ups', 'cat', 'do', 'day', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'what', 'could', 'do', 'real', 'script', 'director', 'choreographer', 'trailer', 'current', 'film', 'Red', 'Canvas', 'looked', 'pretty', 'cool.The', 'DVD', 'full', 'screened', 'decent', 'picture', 'quality', 'only', 'few', 'special', 'features', 'including', 'trivia', 'optional', 'Spanish', 'subtitles', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'would', 'float', 'lot', 'people', 'boats', 'not', 'taken', 'seriously', 'silly', 'fun', 'do', 'type', 'thing', 'act', 'fast', 'print', '2.5', 'stars.1998', 'aka', 'Process']",Ultimate Fight VHS
475128,A156KP4O8SY490,6305736308,markrob0,"[0, 0]","Brilliant movie with not much storyline because i like to think that the way the film has been made is for martial arts action only. Ernie Reeyes Jr did a great job and is very talented and his father Ernie Reeyes Sr is brilliant also. The plot is about a martial arts champion in the filipino style called arnis. His name is Pinoy (Shishir Inocalla) and travels to america in order to find himself and try to find out who he really is after nearly killing his opponent in his last competition back home. His fighting skills are put to the test when he finds himself in the middle of a gang war. Forced into sudden street combat against members of the Crazy Dragons gang, Pinoy saves the life of Jesse (Ernie Reeyes Jr) who was being attacked for stealing the gangs ounce of heroin. Impressed by Pinoys fighting techniques Jesse brings Pinoy with him to introduce him to his father (Ernie Reeyes Sr) and friends. The Crazy Dragons want their merchandise back so with the Crazy Dragon's poofter-freak boss and his right hand man (Kimo- UFC & K1 Fighter) surrounds Jesse's house threatening the lives of each member of the family. Now its time for Jesse to get serious and put his martial art skills to the test.
