It's awesome from start to finish. Kristanna Loken looks exactly like Rayne. Lots of action, Blood, some sex, Thats what the games are so it did not dissapoint. The only thing, it should have been longer. It's a great horror half human half vampire movie. On a HD tv it looks even better. Bloodrayne dvd usually is pretty cheap. I highly recommend it.

Then again, let's be honest with ourselves shall we?  We are talking about a video game who's greatest selling device is that of the letters T and A.  Just like the Tomb Raider series.  T and A.  This is not a video game series that invokes intellectual stimulation (another stimulation, yes, but not intellectual).  You watch the main character, Rayne, going around, bouncing around, leaping, climbing, attacking, solving puzzles, and again leaping.  The game itself tends to be rather repetitive, but then again, it is still a fun game.  You do not get the same invocation kind of storyline you would see in either the Silent Hill series or the Final Fantasy series.The movie itself really is not that bad.  Of course it is a dumb movie with T and A and running around hacking stuff up, people mostly.  What would you expect from a movie based on a video game?  Shakespeare?  Heck, even the plots dont fit with the before mentioned video games, then again, I would have to think that most people probably dont watch and play BR for wisdom teachings (I mean really, the video game even has a cheat code based upon bouncing breasts, how intellectual is that?).  Hardly Shakespeare, even Shakespeare in the park tends to be better.  The movie itself is a fun movie, watch it with friends, watch it to laugh at what is going on, but also watch it because the choreographed action scenes are actually fairly well done.  Watch it when you are playing video games, watch it to kick back at the end of a work week and you dont want something that is too thought provoking.Give it a try.",5,Actually it is a fun movie,1148860800,"05 29, 2006",2006,1668,"['Yes', 'are', 'correct', 'movie', 'not', 'follow', 'plot', 'video', 'games', 'Then', 'again', 'let', 'be', 'honest', 'shall', 'are', 'talking', 'video', 'game', 'who', 'greatest', 'selling', 'device', 'letters', 'T', 'A', 'Just', 'Tomb', 'Raider', 'series', 'T', 'A', 'not', 'video', 'game', 'series', 'intellectual', 'stimulation', 'stimulation', 'yes', 'not', 'intellectual', 'watch', 'main', 'character', 'Rayne', 'going', 'around', 'bouncing', 'around', 'leaping', 'climbing', 'attacking', 'solving', 'puzzles', 'again', 'leaping', 'game', 'be', 'rather', 'repetitive', 'then', 'again', 'still', 'fun', 'game', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'same', 'invocation', 'kind', 'storyline', 'would', 'see', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'series', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'series.The', 'movie', 'really', 'not', 'bad', 'course', 'dumb', 'movie', 'T', 'A', 'running', 'around', 'hacking', 'stuff', 'up', 'people', 'mostly', 'What', 'would', 'expect', 'movie', 'based', 'video', 'game', 'Shakespeare', 'Heck', 'even', 'plots', 'dont', 'fit', 'before', 'mentioned', 'video', 'games', 'then', 'again', 'would', 'have', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'probably', 'dont', 'watch', 'play', 'BR', 'wisdom', 'teachings', 'mean', 'really', 'video', 'game', 'even', 'cheat', 'code', 'based', 'bouncing', 'breasts', 'how', 'intellectual', 'Hardly', 'Shakespeare', 'even', 'Shakespeare', 'park', 'be', 'better', 'movie', 'fun', 'movie', 'watch', 'friends', 'watch', 'laugh', 'what', 'going', 'also', 'watch', 'choreographed', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'actually', 'fairly', 'well', 'done', 'Watch', 'when', 'are', 'playing', 'video', 'games', 'watch', 'kick', 'back', 'end', 'work', 'week', 'dont', 'want', 'something', 'too', 'thought', 'provoking.Give', 'try']",N/A
643259,A33H8DC3ZG58T0,B00005JOVM,"Amazon Customer ""gorgon-13""","[2, 5]","So many bad reviews and so much adverse comment as to the skills of Uwe Boll, was it deserved ? I'm afraid the answer is largely yes, this film is patchy in the extreme, truly laden with clich&eacute;s and in common with most game derived movies seems to have been written by somebody with only a passing knowledge of the game. Which is pretty silly as BloodRayne the game doesn't exactly have the most complex plot ever seen. For example in the game Rayne a Dhampir is searching for her father, the setting is Europe in the nineteen thirties, she is located and hired by the Brimstone society and then goes on a series of missions recovering three artefacts from the Thule Society.For reasons that remain unexplained the film decided to run as a prequel and being scripted as a predictable clich&eacute; is set in that mythical eastern Europe beloved of Hammer and all the old Dracula movies. There Rayne is looking for her father and is found and trained by the Brimstone society, presumably they mutually forget each other and the later game setting meeting is an amnesiacs reunion. In common with the game Rayne searches for the artefacts of Beliar, though these would appear to be somewhat different to the game versions she searches out later, presumably some kind of generic naming system for supernatural items. If you're going to do a prequel at least make it imaginative, why swipe bits from the game and take them out of context? It's lazy means nothing to non gamers and will only irritate the game fans who are the core audience. Rayne acquires two artefacts and we are told becomes incredibly powerful, though the special effects budget clearly doesn't run to anything that could demonstrate this. She then gets to enter her fathers castle and kill him, another sign of memory loss perhaps as having exterminated dear old dad, one wonders why she spends the next century or so looking for him, or how he crops up in the game BloodRayne 2. Still not to get bogged down in details, lets look at the film as it stands. As I've already said it's clich&eacute;d, oldie worldie eastern European settings and a plot that creaks. A massive and pointless overdose of dismemberment, luridly blood splattered and all very badly done, poorly choreographed and filmed fight scenes, the list goes on. Then we look at the actors, Madsen and Rodriguez are fine in their comfort zone as urban Americans with attitude, take them out of the zone and their limitations are painfully obvious, they just do not fit into this scenario and utter some of the most painfully stilted lines ever committed to film. Kristanna Locken isn't the worlds greatest actor, but at least she tries, which is more than can be said for the Oscar winning Sir Ben Ghandi Kingsley who's performance is so wooden it's teak like, a man who is clearly hating every moment of the shoot, has no idea why he signed the contract and wants everybody to know what a bad time he's having. Instead of dark and brooding, his head vampire just comes over as constipated.  It's not a good movie, but given time may acquire a bit of cult cachet as one of those bad movies you need to see.And yet despite all this I'm not spitting blood at money wasted and that's because the set includes a DVD copy of BloodRayne 2 the game and to be honest that's what I was after in the first place. I think packing the two together is a good idea and one that other game film teams should consider taking up.",3,Just as well they included the game,1176422400,"04 13, 2007",2007,3450,"['So', 'many', 'bad', 'reviews', 'so', 'much', 'adverse', 'comment', 'skills', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'was', 'deserved', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'answer', 'largely', 'yes', 'film', 'patchy', 'extreme', 'truly', 'laden', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'common', 'most', 'game', 'derived', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'somebody', 'only', 'passing', 'knowledge', 'game', 'Which', 'pretty', 'silly', 'BloodRayne', 'game', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'have', 'most', 'complex', 'plot', 'ever', 'seen', 'example', 'game', 'Rayne', 'Dhampir', 'searching', 'father', 'setting', 'Europe', 'nineteen', 'thirties', 'located', 'hired', 'Brimstone', 'society', 'then', 'series', 'missions', 'recovering', 'three', 'artefacts', 'Thule', 'Society.For', 'reasons', 'remain', 'unexplained', 'film', 'decided', 'run', 'prequel', 'being', 'scripted', 'predictable', 'clich', 'eacute', 'set', 'mythical', 'eastern', 'Europe', 'beloved', 'Hammer', 'old', 'Dracula', 'movies', 'Rayne', 'looking', 'father', 'found', 'trained', 'Brimstone', 'society', 'presumably', 'mutually', 'forget', 'other', 'later', 'game', 'setting', 'meeting', 'amnesiacs', 'reunion', 'common', 'game', 'Rayne', 'searches', 'artefacts', 'Beliar', 'would', 'appear', 'be', 'somewhat', 'different', 'game', 'versions', 'out', 'later', 'presumably', 'kind', 'generic', 'naming', 'system', 'supernatural', 'items', ""'re"", 'going', 'do', 'prequel', 'least', 'make', 'imaginative', 'why', 'swipe', 'bits', 'game', 'take', 'context', 'lazy', 'nothing', 'non', 'gamers', 'will', 'only', 'irritate', 'game', 'fans', 'who', 'are', 'core', 'audience', 'Rayne', 'two', 'artefacts', 'are', 'told', 'becomes', 'incredibly', 'powerful', 'special', 'effects', 'budget', 'clearly', ""n't"", 'run', 'anything', 'could', 'demonstrate', 'then', 'enter', 'fathers', 'castle', 'kill', 'sign', 'memory', 'loss', 'perhaps', 'having', 'exterminated', 'dear', 'old', 'dad', 'one', 'wonders', 'why', 'next', 'century', 'so', 'looking', 'how', 'up', 'game', 'BloodRayne', '2', 'Still', 'not', 'get', 'bogged', 'down', 'details', 'lets', 'look', 'film', ""'ve"", 'already', 'said', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'oldie', 'worldie', 'eastern', 'European', 'settings', 'plot', 'massive', 'pointless', 'overdose', 'dismemberment', 'luridly', 'blood', 'splattered', 'very', 'badly', 'done', 'poorly', 'choreographed', 'filmed', 'fight', 'scenes', 'list', 'Then', 'look', 'actors', 'Madsen', 'Rodriguez', 'are', 'fine', 'comfort', 'zone', 'urban', 'Americans', 'attitude', 'take', 'zone', 'limitations', 'are', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'just', 'do', 'not', 'fit', 'scenario', 'utter', 'most', 'painfully', 'stilted', 'lines', 'ever', 'committed', 'film', 'Kristanna', 'Locken', ""n't"", 'worlds', 'greatest', 'actor', 'least', 'more', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'Sir', 'Ben', 'Ghandi', 'Kingsley', 'who', 'performance', 'so', 'wooden', 'teak', 'man', 'who', 'clearly', 'hating', 'moment', 'shoot', 'idea', 'why', 'signed', 'contract', 'everybody', 'know', 'what', 'bad', 'time', 'having', 'Instead', 'dark', 'brooding', 'head', 'vampire', 'just', 'over', 'constipated', 'not', 'good', 'movie', 'given', 'time', 'may', 'acquire', 'bit', 'cult', 'cachet', 'one', 'bad', 'movies', 'need', 'see.And', 'yet', ""'m"", 'not', 'spitting', 'blood', 'money', 'wasted', 'set', 'DVD', 'copy', 'BloodRayne', '2', 'game', 'be', 'honest', 'what', 'was', 'first', 'place', 'think', 'packing', 'two', 'together', 'good', 'idea', 'one', 'other', 'game', 'film', 'teams', 'should', 'consider', 'taking', 'up']",N/A

But I found it to be quite fun if you ignore its faults.  It's a good stupid movie to slap into the player and watch without using any brainpower.The Good Things:-Kristanna Loken looks great and plays a pretty good character.  I think she may have humanized the role a little; that could be seen as good or bad.  She sure beats the crud out of Natassia Malthe, who plays Rayne in the sequel.-There's lots of gratuitous blood, gore, and sex.  It's not for the squeamish.  In fact, it's better for anybody who loves graphic NR-rated content.-Makeup effects are very wicked.  Did I mention there was lots of violence?-Ben Kingsley, Michelle Rodriguez, and Michael Madsen are all in it, along with some other familiar faces.  Cool!-It's a wickedly dark portrayal of medieval life.The Bad Things:-Nothing is of great quality or value in this film.  It all feels subpar.-There's no real romance, even though they tried to put a love story into it.-Even though there are a lot of good action scenes, the action is not choreographed as smoothly as it could have been.  It's like if ""Army of Darkness"" had kung fu; a little awkward.-The plot is very thin, and you won't really understand it unless you pay close enough attention.  Even then, don't bother.  The plot doesn't really take precedence in this film (is that bad, or what?).It's a bad movie, but it's good for those who like bad movies.  I like to pop it in if I have a sudden urge to see some senseless violence or sex.

By ""he"", I'm referring to Uwe Boll and I keep asking that question. How does he keep: a)making horrible movies; b)still getting opportunities to make more movies; and c) getting top-notch actors in his movies? It's just amazing how the cinematic world allows people like Boll to do whatever they want to ruin successful video game franchises. This time, the next victim is ""Bloodrayne"". Although the movie will only open in 2006, a preview screening was shown in the Austin Film Festival and I was one of the (un)lucky ones to be able to watch it. Wow. He actually CAN spoil franchises.At least, Bloodrayne isn't considered one of the most life-changing video games in the world. It is actually about action, violence, and vampire powers. This ""Bloodrayne"" unites stars such as Ben Kingsley (who is not in a very good form lately), Michael Madsen, Michelle Rodriguez, and Kristianna Lokken, known for her role in Terminator 3. Technically, ""Bloodrayne"" is better than ""House of the Dead"", but worse than ""Alone in the Dark"". It is a joke that seems to take on forever, dragging itself on and on through embarrassing fighting sequences. Dreadful actings, shameful dialogues, and a sex scene indicate we are watching another Uwe Boll film. The entertaining video game becomes a forgettable movie in the hand of today's Ed Wood.Despite one or two decent scenes, ""Bloodrayne"" is absolutely horrible. The story about a major vampire leader, called Kagan (sadly portrayed by Ben Kingsley) who is chased by vampire hunters (Michael Madsen in a disappointing role) is poor and flawed. Kristianna Loken looks really sexy, but as an actress, she is lame. As Rayne, a vengeful dhampir (half human, half vampire), she reminds us why Razzies are in the world for. Almost nothing in this movie works. This is one more of those movies you find tons of clones in the closest videostore. During the screening, I wanted to leave bad, but literally came to tears when I found out I couldn't. ""Bloodrayne"" is waste of time, money, human logic, and sanity. It's torturous, painful, and sad. As for the actual DVD, the special features sucked, and not even the addition of the whole version of the PC game ""Bloodrayne II"" brought my score up... the game sucks too. -_-I'm sure ""Bloodrayne"" will attract tons of hardcore fans who may just believe Uwe Boll has learned his lesson. So I end this review by saying two very important words: he didn't. ""Bloodrayne"" is one more of his irritating mistakes and is one more movie where you can learn a lesson from in the most painful way possible. Enjoy life to the fullest.

After watching the painful ""Alone in the Dark"". I didn't think it was possible for Dr Boll to make anything of any substance. This movie had a atmophere to it. And a very interesting cast which I found quite amuzing ! And to be honest, I enjoyed this much more than what most people consider blockbuster's ! Because I look for interesting and obscure titles ! I guess u can say I am a indie movie lover !For starters Kristanna Loken was a excellent choice for the main character. Kristanna is just simply gorgeous, every since Terminator 3 I just thought she was just the sexiest thing ever ! Not to mention she is Bi and alomost 6 feet tall ! She exuded alot of power in this movie just as she did in T3. Michelle Rodriquez was an interesting character but seemed abit out of place. Her accent seemed abit forced. U could definitley tell it wasn't natural. Micheal Madsen, Oh boy he looked like he had came off of a month drunk benge ! He had zero expression in his lines and he acted as if he didn't care much about anything ! He kept the same expression throughout the whole movie. And kept repeating "" We have work to do "". Billy Zane was just silly and had one of the worst Wigs I have ever seen in Hollywood History ! His character was pointless he was the father of Michelle R's character, Isn't that somthing ? Meatloaf, I guess he was some type of vampire Pimp of some sort which was a bit uproarious !Some of the Props looked fake like for instance the Swords? Oh my  ! They looked as if they were aluminium and retangle shaped instead of sharp and pointed ! Oh my, and some of the lines LOL , for instance. Rayne was locked up in Prison and she was angry, this is what she had to say ? "" I will do what I have to do, I want u to know that what ever it takes, I won't stop fighting for a second"". Then some superhero music started playing and they all stood up ! LOL ! Boy ,Oh boy !  was that entertainment ! But for the record this movie isn't nearly on the level of Dr Boll's previous Two efforts NO NO ! This is actually watchable and enjoyable to a huge extent! If u are looking for a movie to just entertain you and not take it seriously, this is the one ! This is good campy fun at best, and action packed as well ! The fight sequences were a bit redundant ! And u could tell that he was trying to hide alot of the flaws. But using camera trick work  during the fight sequences ! But over all this movie is a hell of alot better than ""Blade Trinity and Queen of the Damned"" ! At least this movie had atomophere and was filmed in a beautiful setting ! And it isn't trying to be something it is not ! It is just what it is a unique movie in its own right ! Blade and Queen where just garbage ! I thought that there was somewhat  of an imaginative effort put into this ! Bloodrayne definitley could have been done alot better from another director. But coming from the source this was not bad ! And I honestley say this is as good as it gets from Dr boll, unfortunatley ! Why did this work for him  somewhat ? He had a great game material to start with and a sexy lead ! But in all honesty, the game is much better ............See Ya !",3,Bloodrayne Isn't Perfect ....

643269,AXKLJRDTPJCA7,B00005JOVM,Boss Fan,"[3, 3]","Maybe his next film can be the story of how I - pissed-off movie-goer forced to suffer thorough a truly bad director's inane and amateurish films - comes to collect the debt by beating it out of said director's a*s!  The epiphany comes when I learn the lesson that it is I who is really at fault because I keep watching this [...]  The message; free will can be a bit*h.Uwe Boll has often been called an Ed Wood for a new generation.  This would be fine if he would admit what a cruddy director he is and just go the straight cheese route; but he insists on trying to make good movies, so we can't even laugh and the schlock of it all.  Instead we marvel at how poorly he tries to cover up his dreck with good-looking production values, locals, and actors.In ""House of the Dead"" he was smart enough to get a bunch of hot girls naked for no other reason than to distract the movie's key demographic (video game geek teens) from the fact that everything else about the movie sucked.  Exotic locals and an attractive, albeit untalented, cast not withstanding, the action was directed so poorly, blandly and confusingly that the whole thing was rendered incomprehensible.  The movie was one long yawn of stuff seen a million times before only this time done more ineptly than perhaps ever before.  It was one of the worst films I had ever seen.  Of course, I had not seen ""Alone in the Dark"" yet.  Everything that went wrong with ""House of the Dead"" goes wrong in that POS as well, except this time it was somehow worse because there is a more convoluted plot that wastes even more of the viewer's time, as if the writers are under the impression it is a good story and we care.  The action, bad as was in ""House"" is even lacking here.  And to add insult to injury, this one didn't even have the decency to throw in any gratuitous [...] shots.And now, Uwe gives us ""Bloodrayne,"" and with it he has crafted sort of a film trilogy from hell.  If anyone has ever indeed sold his soul to the devil the way we have seen in countless stories it must be Mr. Boll.  How this man keeps getting these films into theatres rather than straight to video, not to mention work at all, is beyond me.  He also, somehow, attracts talented actors that would be impressive names in any schlocky horror movie, not to mention one from this guy.  Jurgen Prochnow in ""House of the Dead,"" and in this film we have the Terminatress (Kristana Loken) as well as Michael Madsen (""Reservoir Dogs""), ""Michelle Rodriguez (""S.W.A.T.,"" TVs ""Lost""), Billy Zane (""Titanic""), and, most baffling, Ben Kingsly.  Ben Kingsley!!!  Can you imagine his agent saying, 'Yeah, it's from the acclaimed director of ""Alone in the Dark, do it!'?  Granted a lot of these names tend to toil in low budget fare from time to time, but they are names just the same.  Why they look at these movies and this director and jump on board is beyond me.  His movies are not hits.  They all flop (none has made more than 5 million) and are all panned by critics and those who see them.  So again, why does he get to keep making movies and why do known actors want to make them with him?  This is an even better question to pose to studio execs.  Why do his movies keep going into theatres?!  Why does he get work at all?!  The Devil's got some explaining to do.""Bloodrayne"" is what you'd get if ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" had a retarded baby.  It may actually earn the faint praise as the best of Boll's films.  That's a bit like calling puke better than [...], but if you have to rank all these abominations, I think this one wins.  It starts out with a nice moody tone and some picturesque cinematography.  But then people start to speak.  The dialogue and performances are atrocious from the get go.  Even by the generally good actors.  Michael Madsen sets the tone right off.  He utters the film's first line as if he's reading it from his hooked on phonics book, and all the other actors follow suit.  Loken is hot, doing something akin to a poor (wo)man's Charlize Therone, and this is a Vampire movie that remembers to supply the blood and [...].  But the action, again, is awful.  Fight scenes are sped up and slowed down and blurred and every other damn trick to cover up their lameness.  Some of the death scenes are fun in an over-the-top comically gory way.  But most of the deformed faces of Vampires are laughably obvious masks and other things that have their heads severed or blood drained are obvious dummies.  Ben Kingsley, whether it is intentional or not, is stuck in pancake make-up and looks laughably awful.  And Meatloaf turns up doing his usual over -the-top performance shtick.  He's the only who seems to realize this thing sucks, so hammy is the way to go.  At least he sucks on purpose, whereas everyone else just sucks.I can't stress enough that it is the dialog and the awful line readings that really make this unbearable to observe.  I mean, did they bother to reshoot anything before releasing this?!  Second to that are the poorly staged action scenes, and third is the over all sense of blandness that hangs over this thing.  The story just doesn't matter, and is so bad, and every time it comes into play you just wanna grab for the fast-forward button.So this sounds pretty bad right?  Funny bad, even?  I don't know.  Maybe if you're drunk, but I still say this movie doesn't even warrant a recommendation on the so-bad-its-entertaining scale.  There are those moments to be sure, but because it takes itself so seriously as a whole, the plot pops up and there are long moments of pure, dead screen time.  Stuff is happening but you could care less.  And those stretches ain't funny.Which brings me back to my recommendation that if Boll is gonna keep making these crapfests he needs to get out of his own way and stop thinking somewhere along the line one of them is gonna be good.  Embrace is inner Ed Wood-ness.  Camp it up, ham it up and just give us the over-the-top junk that is the only reason most people watch movies with titles like ""House of the Dead,"" ""Alone in the Dark,"" and ""Bloodrayne"" to begin with.He can start with the story I mentioned at the top of this review.  Or something autobiographical perhaps?  The story of his meeting with Beelzebub.  Of course we all know what happens there.  But we don't yet know how it ends...Ah, chances are he'd even screw up that movie.",1,Uwe Boll now owes me roughly 5 hours of my life back!,1148947200,"05 30, 2006",2006,6382,"['Maybe', 'next',

In the beginning of the movie, for instance, it's stated pretty clearly that plain water will kill a vampire. (Disregarding of course the fact that blood itself is 83% water.) Later on though one of the heroes specifically chooses holy water as weapon so it's a little hard to figure. And as much as I like Michael Madsen I have to say, yeah, he's just awful here. That said though, this isn't as bad a movie as some of the reviews would lead you to believe. Most of the cast gives an honest effort (The Romanian prostitutes aren't half bad.), Kristanna Loken is about the sexiest vampire slayer ever and Michelle Rodriguez is a pretty close second. And in my book anyway, any movie with Meat Loaf in it gets an automatic two stars for cool. And while some of the special effects look like, well, special effects, some of the gore is pretty good. So here's what I'm thinking. If you're not into gore or vampires, don't bother with this one. But if you're sitting on the fence, yeah, go ahead, give it a try.

While she does look the part as Rayne, she didn't convey the part in the movie; I never played any of the ""Bloodrayne"" games, but I know the lead character wasn't boring.  The actress didn't bother to emote whenever she speaks, whenever she performs, or whenever she stands perfectly still with her cleavage hang out.  It's rather difficult to get involved with her plight since she simply walks across straight lines while reading them, and she's not the only performer at fault.  The other actors are blisslessly underperformed; I expected such quality in Michael Madson, who's an incongruous addition among the cast alongside Michelle Rodriguez, but not even Ben Kingsley gave it his best as the antagonist named Kagan.  Such light-handedness could be blamed by the poor script, which has characters deliver corny or awkward lines like, 'Kill her; let find the Eye or let her try, then kill her'.

This movie features Kristanna Loken in the title role. Ms. Loken strains so hard at acting that she looks physically ill whenever a scene calls for anything more than rote recitation of her lines--now THAT'S DEDICATION. Ms. Loken may very well be the new Meryl Streep. They even both have the letters S, T, R, L, and E in their names! Fortunately for Ms. Loken, the film generally only requires her to stand around looking hot and reciting dialogue so subtle and low-key that, to the unenlightened, it might seem wooden or cornball. Anyway, Ms. Loken plays a half-vampire hottie in this movie, and that's something that's never been done before in any movies based on the ""Bloodrayne"" video game.

He proves that no matter how talentless you are, studios will still give you money.Well, how do you explain a movie like ""BloodRayne"" otherwise? The infamous Boll's new film is yet another example of cinematic ineptitude, with bad acting from B-list stars, an atrocious script, and a plot that is actually thinner than the original video game. Someone put this movie out of its misery.Rayne (Kristanna Loken) is a dhampir -- half human, half vampire, the result of a vampire raping a human. Escaping from a life as a sideshow freak, she decides to go kill her daddy Kagan (Sir Ben Kingsley). And Kagan is trying to grab the magical body parts of an ancient vampire, which will make him invincible.Since Rayne is a good bloodsucker (animals and bad guys) she happily joins a band of vampire-haters, the Brimstone Society. Vladimir (Michael Madson), Sebastian (Matt Davis) and Katarin (Michelle Rodriegez) join forces with Rayne. But to stop Kagan, they will have to deal with his vicious vampire hordes.If ""Buffy"" had ripped off ""Blade"" and ""Lord of the Rings,"" then the result might have been something like ""BloodRayne."" Yes, the film is that unoriginal -- Uwe Boll tears off chunks of hit movies, and splatters them together into a movie of his own. But it cannot hide this simple fact: Boll has the skills of a mentally backward Yorkie.Well, Boll is trying hard. He really, really tries hard to make this a thrilling, stunning adventure. But the entire movie is strangled in his ineptitude -- the action is Monty Pythonesque at best, with silly wrangling and geysers of blood. Lots of dismemberment. Funny sex against the jail bars. It's all almost campy, but somehow it's too inane to be.And the cast is the worst. To put it simply, most of the actors seem like escapees from a vampire porn movie, wearing grimy costumes and bad wigs. You know a movie is in trouble when Romanian prostitutes -- real prostitutes -- are more impressive thespians than the lead actress. And if this is medieval Romania, how come everyone is naked?Kristanna Loken proves why she has had no major roles besides a robot, and Michelle Rodriegez plays the Antisocial Bad Girl again. And the two good actors, Ben Kingsley and Michael Madson, are left to wallow in the cinematic gook. I felt genuinely sorry for these two guys, since they will probably be fielding the question ""Why did you do BloodRayne?"" for the next twenty years.At any video store, you'll find dozens of movies of this caliber -- straight to video, with F-list actors.

Sadly, that is what this movie is. In the right hands, this could have been a lot better than it turned out. In Uwe Boll's hands, it turns to trash and a disgrace to the franchise, and once again this has been proven as true.  The sad part is, the start of the film was pretty interesting, but it quickly goes down hill after about the first ten minutes.This film has some pretty well known actors, Ben Kingsley and Michael Madsen to name a couple. The problem is, they didn't seem to care about the script and felt bored the entire movie. Ben Kingsley is a well respected actor and he only gave a half a performance in the movie and it can be seen with everyone in the movie. The script itself wasn't anything worth seeing in the first place. It is literally dull, and when it's not, the dialogue at times is embarrassing. It feels more like watching a stage play written  and performed by a group of high school students instead of watching paid Hollywood actors giving their third best when it comes to acting and horrible directing.The make up for the vampires in the film almost disappointed me as much as the zombies from ""House of the Dead"". It looked cheap and a rip off of vampires seen in so many other TV series and movies such as ""From Dusk to Dawn"" and ""Angel"", both of which are better. The fight scenes look very amateurish and cut so it could be put together faster. It looked so bad, you could almost see the actors not even touching each other and the only way you can someone is fighting is by the swords clanking as they hit each other.Overall, I was severely disappointed with this movie. I didn't believe the other reviews saying how bad this movie was, but they were correct. I tried to enjoy it, but it was just a disappointment by the end, which is another problem.

643298,A3E68QNSCABRVW,B00005JOVM,"Gradient Vector Field ""subjectedtometal (dot)...","[4, 5]","Before I watched this movie I read a lot of the one star reviews here on Amazon.  I must say they significantly lowered my expectations for this movie.  Now, this isn't a good movie by any means, but after reading all the negativity, I was expecting something much much worse... like worst movie I could ever imagine, but this movie is better than Manitou (that's one of the worst films I ever saw).Now, my review is strictly based on the movie for this is my first experience with the Bloodrayne universe.  I've been desperate to find another Femme Fatale character I could get into since Chaos! Comics closed up shop and stopped printing Purgatori.  I found out they were also making Bloodrayne comics and her character looked interesting.  I'm very backlogged in my video games and I have not been able to play the games yet, but I plan on playing them soon!As I've already mentioned, this movie actually beat what I was expecting based on the reviews I read here... that or I am quite easily amused.  There are some absolutely horrible parts of this movie though; like Michael Madson's character, Vladamir, always felt out of place.  He just didn't act well in this movie, it's not Resovoir Dogs.  Kristanna Loken did an alright job as Rayne though, better than I was expecting.  The love making scene was absolutely hilarious though because it was so over exaggerated.  And, yes, she is seen topless, for those who only wanted to see the movie for that fact alone.  Ben Kingsley did a fairly poor performance throughout the whole film, up until the very end during the fight scene.  I thought he finally held the air of royalty as the vampire lord during that scene.The other part of the movie that was absolutely laughable was the gore from the fight scenes.  Seriously, they're absolutely absurd, even for a medieval enactment.  There's one scene where this one guy puts a sword through another guys face then lets go of the sword.  Who does that?  No, you KEEP your blade or else you're screwed; you don't let go for the sake of a good camera gore shot.  Then there's a part where it shows this guy on the ground and a group of men hitting him in the face with maces.  The ""guy"" or mannequin's face is turned to pulp, but do they stop after he's dead?  Nope, five guys stand there and keep hitting the ground.  They even looked bored doing it... there's nothing maniacal about these evil attackers.In the end, I was actually entertained.  It doesn't have a lot of re-watch value, but it's good enough to watch with friends... especially those who will offer up the perfect sarcastic comment at just the right time.  One thing I will warn, do NOT pay full price for this film.  Wait till it costs six dollars used.  It is an absolute waste of 20 dollars full price, even if it comes with the Bloodrayne 2 video game.",3,Exceeds the 1 Star Reports given Here:,1202428800,"02 8, 2008",2008,2823,"['watched', 'movie', 'read', 'lot', 'one', 'star', 'here', 'Amazon', 'must', 'say', 'significantly', 'lowered', 'expectations', 'movie', 'Now', ""n't"", 'good', 'movie', 'means', 'reading', 'negativity', 'was', 'expecting', 'something', 'much', 'much', 'worse', 'worst', 'movie', 'could', 'ever', 'imagine', 'movie', 'better', 'Manitou', 'one', 'worst', 'films', 'ever', 'saw', '.Now', 'review', 'strictly', 'based', 'movie', 'first', 'experience', 'Bloodrayne', 'universe', ""'ve"", 'been', 'desperate', 'find', 'Femme', 'Fatale', 'character', 'could', 'get', 'Chaos', 'Comics', 'closed', 'up', 'shop', 'stopped', 'printing', 'Purgatori', 'found', 'were', 'also', 'making', 'Bloodrayne', 'comics', 'character', 'looked', 'interesting', ""'m"", 'very', 'backlogged', 'video', 'games', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'able', 'play', 'games', 'yet', 'plan', 'playing', 'soon', ""'ve"", 'already', 'mentioned', 'movie', 'actually', 'beat', 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'based', 'reviews', 'read', 'here', 'am', 'quite', 'easily', 'amused', 'are', 'absolutely', 'horrible', 'parts', 'movie', 'Michael', 'Madson', 'character', 'Vladamir', 'always', 'felt', 'place', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'act', 'well', 'movie', 'not', 'Resovoir', 'Dogs', 'Kristanna', 'Loken', 'did', 'alright', 'job', 'Rayne', 'better', 'was', 'expecting', 'love', 'making', 'scene', 'was', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'was', 'so', 'exaggerated', 'yes', 'seen', 'topless', 'who', 'only', 'wanted', 'see', 'movie', 'fact', 'alone', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'did', 'fairly', 'poor', 'performance', 'whole', 'film', 'up', 'very', 'end', 'fight', 'scene', 'thought', 'finally', 'held', 'air', 'royalty', 'vampire', 'lord', 'other', 'part', 'movie', 'was', 'absolutely', 'laughable', 'was', 'gore', 'fight', 'scenes', 'Seriously', ""'re"", 'absolutely', 'absurd', 'even', 'medieval', 'enactment', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'one', 'guy', 'sword', 'guys', 'face', 'then', 'go', 'sword', 'Who', 'No', 'KEEP', 'blade', 'else', ""'re"", 'screwed', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'sake', 'good', 'camera', 'gore', 'shot', 'Then', 'part', 'where', 'guy', 'ground', 'group', 'men', 'hitting', 'face', 'maces', 'guy', 'mannequin', 'face', 'turned', 'pulp', 'do', 'stop', 'dead', 'Nope', 'five', 'guys', 'stand', 'there', 'keep', 'hitting', 'ground', 'even', 'looked', 'bored', 'doing', 'nothing', 'maniacal', 'evil', 'attackers.In', 'end', 'was', 'actually', 'entertained', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 're-watch', 'value', 'good', 'enough', 'watch', 'friends', 'especially', 'who', 'will', 'offer', 'up', 'perfect', 'sarcastic', 'comment', 'just', 'right', 'time', 'One', 'thing', 'will', 'warn', 'do', 'NOT', 'pay', 'full', 'price', 'film', 'Wait', 'six', 'dollars', 'used', 'absolute', 'waste', '20', 'dollars', 'full', 'price', 'even', 'Bloodrayne', '2', 'video', 'game']",N/A

Then, quickly and quietly - click your mouse and skedaddle out of this webpage. If you haven't yet seen this cinematic albatross, then do yourself a favor and don't (it's too late for me, but you go on and save yourself, and - remember - don't look back!). I saw it, and I now utterly loathe myself for my staggering lack of judgment, so much so that, nowadays, I find myself second guessing my every decision, all because of BLOODRAYNE. Obviously, this malady of mine can only be cured by an attempt to alleviate the turbulent world situation somehow; after some thought and realizing that I have neither wealth, power, political prowess, nor a starring role in the Lara Croft flicks, my contribution must then come in the form of this cautionary review. By hopefully dissuading you from viewing this piece of dreck, my hope is that you won't grow biased against innocent Romanians or harbor intense resentment against Sir Ben Kingsley (although it's okay to resent Michael Madsen). Trust me, this isn't worth spending an hour and a half of your non-refundable time, time you could better spend watching the superior SON OF THE MASK. Ewe Boll, as it turns out, sucks more than his vampires. Ewe Boll is to directing what H.P. Lovecraft is to light-hearted sketch comedy.Normally, this is the point where I'd unveil something of the film plot, but, no...I don't want to. Suffice it to say, there are uninventive vampires, gratuitous blood-letting, uninspired and unconvincing fight scenes, cheesy f/x, and lackluster acting - except that ""lackluster"" might be too complimentary an adjective; the apt descriptive for the acting here is ""f*cked up."" The two most credible actors present are Michelle Rodriguez (GIRLFIGHT) and Ben Kingsley (GANDHI), and, frankly, what the hell were they thinking?Also, I'm all for formal, stilted dialogue when warranted, and I guess the period setting does take place sometime in the 18th century (apparently, before the invention of contractions), but every word that grudgingly emanates from the actors' lips are excruciatingly cringe-worthy and delivered with the cinematic charisma of a coma victim or a Baldwin brother.Here's the thing: I don't like to give out negative reviews. I'm a fairly positive person. Normally, with the books I've read and the films I've watched, if I don't like 'em, I don't bother writing about 'em. Why bother, when I can write glowing endorsements for stuff I actually enjoy? Which begs this question: what kind of a movie is so stinky that I actually relish the trashing of it? Yup, it's this one. In fact, the only enjoyment I derive from the BLOODRAYNE experience (other than in fleetingly seeing Kristanna Loken nude) is in giving it the smackdown on page. BLOODRAYNE seems, on the surface, to be mouthwatering eye candy, chock full of caramel goodness, but, on actual perusal, tastes like the candy's full of strychnine, two-month-old coleslaw, and toe jam.

I gave up on the guy after House of the dead. But I was given an advance copy of Bloodrayne, and I gotta say, it's his best work. Though that really isn't saying much. Yeah, it's low budget, but the guy finances his own movies. Thats why he is able to get virtually any video game licsense he wants. These game companies want money, most of them don't care about the quality of the movie. Thats why they make budget price games. It's all about the benjamins. Anyhoo. If any one except Boll made this movie, there would not be half of the bad reviews that there are. Sure, there has been way better vampire action flicks, but this one does hold it's own weight. Substantial blood and guts, resonable storyline, and pretty good battle scenes. As for the fanboys(and girls) who say it has nothing to do with the game, IT'S A PREQUAL! It's a shame that this movie got critically hammered because it could have made a good franchise. And leave the actors alone. Since when could Micheal Madsen act(Species? Thats Oscar caliber!!)? Michelle Rodriguez is hot, but she should probably stick to Lost. The only actor worth a damn in this was Ben Kingsley. But still, it's a good movie. I enjoyed it. I say if you're a fan of the genre, check it out. It's something different. One final note.....I noticed that there are a lot of reviewers crying about the lack of realism in Bloodrayne.......A.

643307,A26MBNH7KPR44Z,B00005JOVM,Jayvee Chun,"[10, 12]","Video game adaptations have always had a bad name, and not unfairly so... Year after year, bad quality films based on their pixelated counterparts hit the silver screen, earn some dough, and disappear to eternity, offering utter mindlessness and stupidity for an hour and a half. With that said, not all game adaptations are that bad. Personally, I found the Tomb Raider series, especially the first movie, to be not only entertaining but sufficiently satisfying even though it has its own share of at best, minor boo boos. That is where Blood Rayne come short. It comes short of holding up the entertainment, fails miserably in the props and costumes, and does little justice to a fun game. Video game movies usually have sleek style to back it up... Sadly, Bloodrayne failed in that crucial department.I think its funny, really, to see how star studded the cast is. For me, its unfortunate for the actors to star in such a diabolically bad movie. The story is sufficient to say the most but that is not where the problems lie. The story, no matter how fine it is, was executed poorly because of the screenplay. Choppy moments, bad character build-up, a horrible script, and bad acting plague the story, making it dull and unbearable. The acting, especially, was extra bad because I think the actors were acting unaturally, especially Michelle Rodriguez who was speaking in this sassy accent when I have been always used to hear her say unrefined, straight-up lines in her other movies. The dialogue is just too hard and untappable for us to be entertained.The effects are another issue. I guess all their budget went to recruiting the actors so they had mediocre visuals. I mean Rayne's outfit is just bad... She didn't seem like the heroine we know in the games. Her pants are even too baggy. Its as though Kristanna went to some costume store and wore that to shooting. The fights, which is crucial to an action movie like this, were not sufficient. They appeared here and there but there was no big deal. There was no moment where we just watched in awe. Even the final battle didn't feel like a final battle but rather, one of those run-of-the-mill fights she has with mere mortals.As a whole, Bloodrayne was not a successful adaptation. It felt as though I was watching an unfinished movie which could have been good if better screenplay was present and a more fluid script was pitched.",2,...

This movie is pretty much like the video game where the more blood the better since if you want to see dismemberments and blood, well you'll see plenty here. The actors and actresse are funny as it dies seem in a way that they are half heartedly acting out thier parts. I do have to laugh at one aspect and thats the sex scene in the jail which in a way is a kinda turn on (yeah i'm a sicko but hey, when you tear off clothes why wouldn't you be)? The thing i laugh about and this goes for a lot of movies.... anyone notice this intense sex these two were having lasted like 20 seconds if that? telling you i couldn't be that quick even if you were going to give me a million dollars. I know they didn't want to draw too much into that part of it but honestly they should of. She needs to release tension somehow and can't kill all the time which when watching this movie, thats all that happens 24/7. If you get technical when you see this movie you think that she left the circus and ended the main fight with her father all in 2 days. (theres like only 3 scenes including the ending where something happens diring the daylight). I don't know if it was more of a storyline or character development but you can tell something is severly missing here. Honestly from watching this movie it was to have more blood shed than any movie has ever done before and thats all it is... a glorified bloodbath. Did i like it? yes i did. glad i bought it? yes. would i recommend it to others? hard to say as i have weird taste and well, as i said, this movie highly depends on what you want to see. if you want to see a b-rated movie thats not corny, then yes watch this. if you were expecting a great directed movie with great character development and a story that makes you shocked... well this is based off a videogame and not many of them became blockbusting hits. I would definately rent this first to see if its your taste before you purchase the DVD.*By the way, did anyone else wonder about the ending? I mean it shows the worst bloodshed of the whole movie and everything but it almost makes no sense.

She gets a fortune about her past including how the still alive and powerful vampire lord Kagen (Ben Kingsley) is her father as she goes on a quest to destroy him with the help Vladmire (Michael Madsen) and Sabastian (Matt Davis).A poorly done mess of a movie!

Michael Madsen plays his usual tough guy but with long hair and tunic and it just doesn't come off as well.  Ben Kingsley is Rayne's vampire father and a local warlord.  Rayne escapes from being a captive of a traveling circus and the plot begins.Madsen and company are part of something called Brimstone.  They hunt vampires and Madsen is looking for Rayne as he suspects what she really is.  Kingsley is building his army and getting ready to seize power.  Only the weakened Brimstone stands in his way.  If he can collect three parts from a legendary vampire, he will be unstoppable.  Rayne wants to kill vampires.We never learn what Brimstone really is or what they are capable of.  We don't know who Kingsley is seizing power from as there seems to be no government or rulers.  The ending is strange and non-climactic.  The special effects are laughable with the effects team spending their time on making blood spray fiercely from the slightest of wounds and even from dead bodies.  But don't worry, at the end of the movie there is a montage that reshows some of the most spectacular bleeding.Between not having the plot revealed and the silly special effects there seems little point to this film.  I was so uninspired that I didn't even try loading the free video game that comes with the movie.

As if you thought some movies hit rock bottom in theatres, Uwe surprises you and shows you how bad movies can really be!Bloodrayne follows a young vampire who's very upset with her father and wants to kill him.  After  hunting for what has seemed the most horrendous 24 hours of her life because she was forced to star in this mad pot of monkey poop, she finally does it.Now, I'm sure you're asking, where does this movie go wrong?  The REAL question you should be asking is where does this movie go right?First of all, let's discuss the acting and how wonderfully horrid it is.  If you were to gather several stoned teenagers and stick popsicles down their pants, you would probably get better acting experience than in this movie.  Talking in monotone, actors who clearly didn't want to be there, spitting their lines out as if they were all hungover and just wanted this endless nightmare of a production to end sounds more like it.What Uwe Boll likes to do is make these awesomely intense war scenes filled with gore, and guts, and more gore, and more war, and then some more gore!  He also likes to drag these out for at least 1/3 of the movie, giving you a pointless slaughter spree of broken red hoses and gutsy mannequins.  As you continually watch the endless craze of a blatantly overdone violence escapade, you get introduced to new characters who appear drunk and running from the cops, spewing lines that make even the most witless person seem like a genius.After all the ""fun"" we've had watching actors and actresses bumble across the set as if they're drugged and lost in a house of mirrors, we get to the awesome finale where right as Rayne destroys the main bad guy, she has the decency to relive the entire film through her own eyes.  That's right ladies and gentlemen, you get to watch this movie twice!  Except the second time around is only about 5 minutes, if only it were that long from the start.So, if you enjoy terrible acting, overdone violence scenes, and having to relive this epic nightmare twice, than Bloodrayne is for you!

(To every person who blithely claims this is the worst film ever I recommend Raptor Island on the Sci-fi network as a primer on how bad genre films can actual be or perhaps a made for PAX disaster film such as the obviously titled Killer Flood: The Day the Dam Broke.) Yes Uwe's House of the Dead was a particularity stupid film. I hated it too. But Uwe knows how to point his camera in the general direction of the action and keep the action at a pace that holds ones interest.BloodRayne is a surprisingly enjoyable genre romp. Yes all the individual criticisms at the film from the bizarre choices in hair pieces and costumes to the silly dialogue are true. But c'mon it's a video game/vampire movie. Really how high are ones expectations going in? For a video game movie it isn't half bad. (Its tons better than say Doom, not as tightly put together as say Resident Evil) Uwe brings a refreshing European sensibility to sex and violence in the movie (In other words plenty of gratuitous nudity and violence). He also makes good use of the Romanian landscape bringing an almost Peter Jackson feel to the proceedings.Also in campy side of things it's always fun watching Hollywood professionals ruin careers for the sake of a paycheck. (The way Madsen looks and acts in this movie I wouldn't hire him to do my lawn and Kingsley acts as if he is auditioning for the Mr. Burns role in an upcoming live action Simpson's movie) So Uwe Boll isn't the next Ed Wood more a talentless Paul Verhoeven.

643324,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B00005JOVM,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[1, 5]","""Bloodrayne"" has received nothing but poor publicity from the moment it hit the big screen.  It's been written off for everything from bad acting, horrible action, and darn-near porn sequences.  However, after watching this flick, I don't really see what all the fuss is about.  Sure, the acting is really bad at times, but I've seen worse in many other flicks.  The action looks pretty good in my opinion, though the blood and gore is actually silly at times.  As far as the porn goes, there's a bunch of naked prostitutes in one sequence who do nothing more than lay around on Meatloaf and Rayne gets a little lovin' on the bars of her cell, but nothing that goes any farther than flicks such as ""Body Heat"" and ""An Officer And A Gentleman"" and, more recently, ""Hostel.""Many people seem to be turned off by the fact that the movie doesn't follow the video game as closely as they'd like.  ""Resident Evil"" did the same thing, but managed to handle its own story a little better.  ""Tomb Raider"" is better as a game, no matter how nice Angelina Jolie looks in those tight little outfits.The cast is pretty stiff at times, but I feel that that is primarily due to the fact that the script was rather stiff as well.  Michael Madsen turns in a pretty bad performance as Vladimir, and Michelle Rodriguez is, well, Michelle Rodriguez.  She plays pretty much the same character in every movie she's in, and I'm glad that her role wasn't expanded too much.  Ben Kingsley, who's overrated in my opinion, doesn't have much to do in this flick until the final minutes, in which he delivers his lines in standard Kingsley fashion.  Matt Davis, as Sebastian, delivers a pretty good performance, but the standout is Kristanna Loken as Rayne, who manages to take an iffy character and make her pretty decent to watch on the screen.  Billy Zane has a minor role as Rodriguez' father, but he makes the most of it as he fumbles along nonchalantly as the mortal and immortal worlds collide.The bloodletting in this flick is borderline silly.  In one particular fight sequence at a monastery (headed by none other than Udo Kier, an underused actor in just about every flick he's in), the blood flows at an unusually high rate.  At certain points, you can actually see the gas used to blow the blood out of the ""bodies"" as each is impaled, hacked, decapitated, and smashed.  However, this is a frequent happening in B-movie action.  It's nothing new to fans of any old school zombie flicks.  What's even funnier is that the main characters get nary a drop of blood on their clothing while the blood is flying.So why did I give this flick three stars?  For the simple fact that all involved seemed to know that it wouldn't be a great film and some of them, particularly Loken, Zane and Davis, seemed to have fun with it.  Madsen and Rodriguez didn't seem too happy to be there, but they aren't as great at acting as they might think they are.  What's really funny about this flick is that Madsen and Kingsley were in ""Species"" and Davis and Rodriguez were in ""Blue Crush.""  Rodriguez is also a veteran of the video game genre, having been in ""Resident Evil"" before ""Bloodrayne.""  That's quite a bit of trivia for one flick.If you enjoyed Loken, I suggest picking up ""Dark Kingdom,"" which is a nice step above ""Bloodrayne.""  It's got the whole dragon and sorcery thing going for it, and it's based on an ancient tragedy.I'll admit that most people will probably not enjoy ""Bloodrayne"" as much as I did, but it isn't as terrible as many have posted here.  It's silly most of the time, stiffly acted, and there's a little more flesh than most video game flicks, but it's worth at least a rental.In short, ""Bloodrayne"" is an average low-budget action flick based on a video game.  It's not nearly as good as the ""Resident Evil"" flicks, but it suffices.",3,What's All The Fuss About?,1148947200,"05 30, 2006",2006,3826,"['Bloodrayne', 'received', 'nothing', 'poor', 'publicity', 'moment', 'hit', 'big', 'screen', 'been', 'written', 'off', 'everything', 'bad', 'acting', 'horrible', 'action', 'darn-near', 'porn', 'sequences', 'However', 'watching', 'flick', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'see', 'what', 'fuss', 'Sure', 'acting', 'really', 'bad', 'times', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'worse', 'many', 'other', 'flicks', 'action', 'pretty', 'good', 'opinion', 'blood', 'gore', 'actually', 'silly', 'times', 'As', 'far', 'porn', 'bunch', 'naked', 'prostitutes', 'one', 'sequence', 'who', 'do', 'nothing', 'more', 'lay', 'Meatloaf', 'Rayne', 'little', 'lovin', 'bars', 'cell', 'nothing', 'farther', 'flicks', 'such', 'Body', 'Heat', 'Officer', 'A', 'Gentleman', 'more', 'recently', 'Hostel', 'Many', 'people', 'seem', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'fact', 'movie', ""n't"", 'follow', 'video', 'game', 'as', 'closely', ""'d"", 'like', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'did', 'same', 'thing', 'managed', 'handle', 'own', 'story', 'little', 'better', 'Tomb', 'Raider', 'better', 'game', 'matter', 'how', 'nice', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'tight', 'little', 'outfits.The', 'cast', 'pretty', 'stiff', 'times', 'feel', 'primarily', 'due', 'fact', 'script', 'was', 'rather', 'stiff', 'well', 'Michael', 'Madsen', 'pretty', 'bad', 'performance', 'Vladimir', 'Michelle', 'Rodriguez', 'well', 'Michelle', 'Rodriguez', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'character', 'movie', ""'m"", 'glad', 'role', 'was', ""n't"", 'expanded', 'too', 'much', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'who', 'overrated', 'opinion', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'do', 'flick', 'final', 'minutes', 'lines', 'standard', 'Kingsley', 'fashion', 'Matt', 'Davis', 'Sebastian', 'pretty', 'good', 'performance', 'standout', 'Kristanna', 'Loken', 'Rayne', 'who', 'take', 'iffy', 'character', 'make', 'pretty', 'decent', 'watch', 'screen', 'Billy', 'Zane', 'minor', 'role', 'Rodriguez', 'father', 'most', 'along', 'nonchalantly', 'mortal', 'immortal', 'worlds', 'collide.The', 'bloodletting', 'flick', 'borderline', 'silly', 'one', 'particular', 'fight', 'sequence', 'monastery', 'headed', 'none', 'other', 'Udo', 'Kier', 'underused', 'actor', 'just', 'flick', 'blood', 'unusually', 'high', 'rate', 'certain', 'points', 'can', 'actually', 'see', 'gas', 'used', 'blow', 'blood', 'bodies', 'impaled', 'hacked', 'decapitated', 'smashed', 'However', 'frequent', 'happening', 'B-movie', 'action', 'nothing', 'new', 'fans', 'old', 'school', 'zombie', 'flicks', 'What', 'even', 'funnier', 'main', 'characters', 'get', 'nary', 'drop', 'blood', 'clothing', 'blood', 'flying.So', 'why', 'did', 'give', 'flick', 'three', 'stars', 'simple', 'fact', 'involved', 'seemed', 'know', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'great', 'film', 'particularly', 'Loken', 'Zane', 'Davis', 'seemed', 'have', 'fun', 'Madsen', 'Rodriguez', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'too', 'happy', 'be', 'there', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'great', 'acting', 'might', 'think', 'are', 'What', 'really', 'funny', 'flick', 'Madsen', 'Kingsley', 'were', 'Species', 'Davis', 'Rodriguez', 'were', 'Blue', 'Crush', 'Rodriguez', 'also', 'veteran', 'video', 'game', 'genre', 'having', 'been', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'Bloodrayne', 'quite', 'bit', 'trivia', 'one', 'flick.If', 'enjoyed', 'Loken', 'suggest', 'picking', 'up', 'Dark', 'Kingdom', 'nice', 'step', 'Bloodrayne', 'got', 'whole', 'dragon', 'sorcery', 'thing', 'going', 'based', 'ancient', 'tragedy.I', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'enjoy', 'Bloodrayne', 'as', 'much', 'did', ""n't"", 'as', 'terrible', 'many', 'have', 'posted', 'here', 'silly', 'most', 'time', 'stiffly', 'acted', 'little', 'more', 'flesh', 'most', 'video', 'game', 'flicks', 'worth', 'least', 'rental.In', 'short', 'Bloodrayne', 'average', 'low-budget', 'action', 'flick', 'based', 'video', 'game', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'flicks']",N/A

643337,A2C2U13J7R1DON,B00005JOVM,"Martha Mullins ""Martha""","[6, 9]","Don't go into BloodRayne with HIGH HOPES of excellence because you will be disappointed, COMPLETELY.Instead, do what I did. Have an expectation of some overacting, some bad cgi, and a crappy direction due to the director being Uwe Boll who has never directed a ""good"" movie. Look for aspects of the game aka BloodRayne's attire, attitude, some of the story from both games 1 and 2... and look for good blood rage scenes. If you go in thinking that before you see the movie... do not compare it TOTALLY to the games and to ANY other vampire movie... you will have the same thoughts I am about to share with you.The GOOD:BloodRayne was not a bad movie nor was it a great movie. It was a decent movie for one based on a video game. There was no overacting (save for a few scenes) and the CGI was awesome actually (especially the castles). Blood rage and Blood effects were awesome. And Rayne herself has SOME of her aspects and attitude from the games in the movie. Michael Madsen, I love you. You did such an AWESOME role as Vladamir. AWESOME DUDE. There has yet to be a movie Michael Madsen has done that I have NOT liked him in. UDO KEIR... I love you my man. You are a horror legend and anytime I see you, I am always in awe of you. I love you seriously. Billy Zane, you rock the socks like no tomorrow. I love ya! You seriously should have played Rayne's father Kagan. Zane as Kagan would have majorly rocked!!!! Costuming... ROCKED!!! Enough Said.THE BAD and UGLY:However, I believe some of the parts were miscast. Meatloaf... WHAT THE *insert cuss word here* ?!?! I mean, come on. Would hot naked chicks actually go for Meatloaf? REALLY!?!?! No. I think not. And his expressions were kinda over the top. Michelle Rodriguez overacted terribly to the point I wanted her dead... which Rayne delivered (thank you Rayne). I have seen Michelle Rodriguez in MANY a movie and always disliked her attitude but in this movie with her FAKE accent she couldn't pull off... I just wanted to kill her really. Ben Kingsley wasn't who I think should have played Rayne's father. No. He was too old and too fragile looking to be Kagan. Kagan in the games was stronger and harder and more menacing looking. And seriously, no offense.... but Kingsley can't look that menacing really... not in that fake wig especially. And sorry but the girl who played Rayne... Kristanna Loken, the only movie I have ever seen her in that she did GOOD in was Terminator 3 and that is because she didn't speak. I think someone more dynamic could have played Rayne. Also, too long and too bad of a SEX SCENE there between Rayne and ol' good Non-Vampire dude who's name I never caught at all. John said this movie had too much gore but I didn't think so.MARTHA'S OVERALL RATING:I would have to give BloodRayne a 3 star rating simply because it wasn't bad but it wasn't great. I did like it. I didn't feel I wasted my time or money renting it or seeing it. I have seen worse vampire and even worse video game based movies. And what's more... I have seen WORSE Uwe Boll movies (*cough*HOUSE OF THE DEAD*cough*)So, make up your own Mind about BloodRayne. Follow my instructions above, see it, and draw your own conclusions. I never follow what the OFFICIAL CRITICS say because they blow smoke up their butts and out their mouths. They wouldn't know REAL GOOD movies if they bit them in the bootay.When it comes to BloodRayne... it actually surprised me. I expected it to be a lot worse... but it was decent.ALSO NOTE: THIS IS NOT A MOVIE FOR KIDS AT ALL so tuck the kids in.

Featuring Kristanna Loken in the less-than-enigmatic role of Rayne, a vampire-human hybrid set out to avenge her mother's death by the hands of the big, bad vamp Kagan, the film showcases un-noteable acting, less-than-exciting fight sequences, plenty of bare flesh, and a shameless amount of bloodletting.Disregarding the video game's original storyline of a pre-WWII demon-slaying adventure, the film takes place in a fictional medieval universe where a vampire seeks the remnants of an enigmatic ancestor to empower himself, while his hybrid daughter seeks his death for the murdering of her mother. The film follows Rayne as she escapes her gypsy-esque captors and becomes integrated into the Brimstone Society, which seeks to bring down the ambitious Kagan.Told hastily and in a Harry Potter-like chopping fashion, the film's storyline is provided neither depth nor importance, as the contained scenarios hardly reach out to the audience, highlighting little more than the gory battle scenes, the senseless sexual encounters, and some forced moments of American-envisioned glory. The film's main appeal, after having discarded entirely with the foundations of the video game, is to those exciteable by an excess of blood and sex, both of which are presented in unnecessary amounts and without much motivation behind them.Nothing in particular about ""BloodRayne"" is outstanding or even beyond average or run-of-the-mill - the story has been told before, the production is reminicent of any weekly television show, the acting is nowhere near award-winning, and there are better fight scenes in ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"" than in this production. Even a surprise appearance by rock & roll hero Meat Loaf can't lift this film close to the barline, and its inadequacy as even a summer blockbuster can't be masked by the obscene depictions of violence (pure shock factors) that serves as one of the film's foundations.While the producers can be credited for employing better graphics, costumes, and art direction than depicted in ""House Of The Dead"" and by exhibiting a gorgeous mountainous terrain in several scenes (truly reminicent of ""Lord Of The Rings""), no amount of tidbits can cover up ""BloodRayne""'s lackluster portrayal as just another silly action film, and just another bad effort by Uwe ""can't-take-a-hint"" Boll.",2,"A Bloody, Sordid Display",1167609600,"01 1, 2007",2007,2786,"['Video', 'game', 'fans', 'must', 'remain', 'hopeful', 'will', 'someday', 'be', 'made', 'satisfactory', 'adaption', 'much-loved', 'console', 'arcade', 'franchise.Regardless', 'when', 'will', 'be', 'made', 'will', 'surely', 'not', 'be', 'directed', 'Uwe', 'Boll.Barely', 'improving', 'shamelessly', 'godawful', 'techniques', 'House', 'Dead', 'German', 'director', 'out', 'once', 'more', 're-craft', 'largely', 'destory', 'gamer', 'legacy', 'time', 'form', 'gory', 'vampire-themed', 'action', 'title', 'BloodRayne', 'Featuring', 'Kristanna', 'Loken', 'less-than-enigmatic', 'role', 'Rayne', 'vampire-human', 'hybrid', 'set', 'out', 'avenge', 'mother', 'death', 'hands', 'big', 'bad', 'vamp', 'Kagan', 'film', 'un-noteable', 'acting', 'less-than-exciting', 'fight', 'sequences', 'plenty', 'bare', 'flesh', 'shameless', 'amount', 'bloodletting.Disregarding', 'video', 'game', 'original', 'storyline', 'pre-WWII', 'demon-slaying', 'adventure', 'film', 'place', 'fictional', 'medieval', 'universe', 'where', 'vampire', 'remnants', 'enigmatic', 'ancestor', 'empower', 'hybrid', 'daughter', 'death', 'murdering', 'mother', 'film', 'Rayne', 'gypsy-esque', 'captors', 'becomes', 'integrated', 'Brimstone', 'Society', 'bring', 'down', 'ambitious', 'Kagan.Told', 'hastily', 'Harry', 'Potter-like', 'chopping', 'fashion', 'film', 'storyline', 'provided', 'neither', 'depth', 'importance', 'contained', 'scenarios', 'hardly', 'reach', 'out', 'audience', 'highlighting', 'little', 'more', 'gory', 'battle', 'scenes', 'senseless', 'sexual', 'encounters', 'forced', 'moments', 'American-envisioned', 'glory', 'film', 'main', 'appeal', 'having', 'discarded', 'entirely', 'foundations', 'video', 'game', 'exciteable', 'excess', 'blood', 'sex', 'are', 'presented', 'unnecessary', 'amounts', 'much', 'motivation', 'them.Nothing', 'particular', 'BloodRayne', 'outstanding', 'even', 'average', 'run-of-the-mill', 'story', 'been', 'told', 'production', 'reminicent', 'weekly', 'television', 'show', 'acting', 'nowhere', 'near', 'award-winning', 'are', 'better', 'fight', 'scenes', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'production', 'Even', 'surprise', 'appearance', 'rock', 'roll', 'hero', 'Meat', 'Loaf', 'ca', ""n't"", 'lift', 'film', 'close', 'barline', 'inadequacy', 'even', 'summer', 'blockbuster', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'masked', 'obscene', 'depictions', 'violence', 'pure', 'shock', 'factors', 'one', 'film', 'foundations.While', 'producers', 'can', 'be', 'credited', 'employing', 'better', 'graphics', 'costumes', 'direction', 'depicted', 'House', 'Dead', 'exhibiting', 'gorgeous', 'mountainous', 'terrain', 'several', 'scenes', 'truly', 'reminicent', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'amount', 'tidbits', 'can', 'cover', 'up', 'BloodRayne', 'lackluster', 'portrayal', 'just', 'silly', 'action', 'film', 'just', 'bad', 'effort', 'Uwe', ""can't-take-a-hint"", 'Boll']",N/A
643343,A34X9EZTTQR7R7,B00005JOVM,"MK ""Hussar""","[3, 5]","Director Uwe Boll's (""House of the Dead"") latest foray into the realm of the supernatural is itself a hybrid, much like the film's protagonist--a half-farce, half-travesty journey into the depths of filmmaking hell.  Making sport of director Boll's films is so commonplace that it has become far past fashionable and is now nearer to being pass&eacute;.  Yet, the man persists in adding fuel to the fire of negative public opinion with the atrocious ""Bloodrayne.""Kristanna Loken (""Terminator 3"") continues her descent into B-movie obscurity as Rayne, a half-human, half-vampire dhampir who discovers her destiny after escaping from her traveling carnival ""home.""  An attempted rape brings out her bloodrage--resulting in her slaughtering most of her former captors in hyperpressurized arterial blood-spewing bliss--while simultaneously awakening long-hidden memories in Rayne.  The vampire lord Kagan (Ben Kingsley, ""You Kill Me,"" ""Ghandi"") is evidently responsible for both Rayne's existence and the death of her mother.  Swearing vengeance, she embarks upon a journey to further her powers by collecting relict body parts from an ancient vampire destroyed long ago.  As she journeys towards a distinct monastery in search of the first artifact, she is pursued by two opposing factions--those who conspire to serve, and those who pledge to destroy Kagan.This is the sort of movie which conjures up fear in the heart of the viewer--fear that one will never again find that all-important ""engagement of the senses"" that must occur to enjoy any movie, especially epic fantasy.  I actually began to worry that the atrocious acting, horrible fight choreography, and random sex-themed encounters would destroy my ability to suspend my disbelief in any future movie.Fight encounter film-editing is a touchy affair.  Edit too slowly or not enough, and combat seems like ""real people"" are doing the fighting--in other words, it's boring.  Edit too quickly, and only an ADHD-afflicted individual off his or her medications can keep up with the action.  ""Bloodrayne"" is guilty of both, with the dubious bonus of copious gore which is frankly silly in its implementation.Despite blanket negative criticism of the film's actors, they did not all perform terribly, although nary an Oscar performance lurks here.  Playing Vladimir, a leader of the virtuous Brimstone Society, Michael Madsen (""Reservoir Dogs"") performs so horribly that suspicion is cast that he ever possessed acting ability.  He fights like someone who has had their entire vertebral column fused together.  Michelle Rodriguez plays Katarin, the daughter of Brimstone alumnus-turned-vampire Elrich (Billy Zane)--their cinematographic relation is even more believable considering that both have been irrevocably typecast into supporting roles which do little more than provide a paycheck.  Michelle acts like a time machine transported her character from ""The Fast and the Furious"" to medieval Romania, while giving her a sword and tunic for her trouble.  Billy Zane appears to be auditioning for the role of Macbeth.  Meat Loaf turns up in a bizarre scene with allegedly authentic Romanian prostitutes.

Hollywood realized a few years back that some videogames can make really good movies for a number of reasons including that there is already a fan base installed from the VG itself. With that being said its not hard to see why most of them fail horribly.Here is a tip for Hollywood: Just because a movie is about a videogame character does not mean that you can ignore all of the basic principals on how to make a decent film. You need a good script, you need a good director, you need good performers, You need a good cinematographer, you need a good score etc....  From my experience in viewing movies made from videogames, and I have seen most of them, there seems to be this serious lack in quality that is present in other genres of  film. Its almost like they get lazy because they are dealing with a character that has already proven to be popular and obviously somewhat successful.Bloodrayne could have been a much better movie than it is plain and simple. The only good thing about this film is Kristanna Loken. She is just so strikingly beautiful that the scenes she is in are at least somewhat bearable just from her apperance alone. Its the age old power of beauty. That being said everything else about this movie is a joke. The cinematography was mediocre, The fight scenes were incredibly simplistic & the dialogue could have been written by a 12 year old film student. This combined with absolutly horrid directing by the now infamous Uwe and piss poor acting even by the somewhat decent actors like Ben Kingsley have ranked this videogame movie right at the bottom of the list.If you absolutly love vampires and absolutly love looking at beautiful women on screen then by all means see this movie for a few hours of brainless entertainment, otherwise do yourself a favor and avoid this movie at all costs.GotMyOrangeCrush",1,This movie has one thing going for it and its not Uwe..,1146528000,"05 2, 2006",2006,1904,"['One', 'can', 'understand', 'how', 'movie', 'got', 'green', 'light', 'be', 'made', 'Hollywood', 'realized', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'videogames', 'can', 'make', 'really', 'good', 'movies', 'number', 'reasons', 'including', 'already', 'fan', 'base', 'installed', 'VG', 'being', 'said', 'not', 'hard', 'see', 'why', 'most', 'fail', 'tip', 'Hollywood', 'Just', 'movie', 'videogame', 'character', 'not', 'mean', 'can', 'ignore', 'basic', 'principals', 'how', 'make', 'decent', 'film', 'need', 'good', 'script', 'need', 'good', 'director', 'need', 'good', 'performers', 'need', 'good', 'cinematographer', 'need', 'good', 'score', 'etc', 'experience', 'viewing', 'movies', 'made', 'videogames', 'have', 'seen', 'most', 'be', 'serious', 'lack', 'quality', 'present', 'other', 'genres', 'film', 'almost', 'get', 'lazy', 'are', 'dealing', 'character', 'already', 'proven', 'be', 'popular', 'obviously', 'somewhat', 'successful.Bloodrayne', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'plain', 'simple', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'film', 'Kristanna', 'Loken', 'just', 'so', 'strikingly', 'beautiful', 'scenes', 'are', 'least', 'somewhat', 'bearable', 'just', 'apperance', 'alone', 'age', 'old', 'power', 'beauty', 'being', 'said', 'everything', 'else', 'movie', 'joke', 'cinematography', 'was', 'mediocre', 'fight', 'scenes', 'were', 'incredibly', 'simplistic', 'dialogue', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'written', '12', 'year', 'old', 'film', 'student', 'combined', 'absolutly', 'horrid', 'directing', 'now', 'infamous', 'Uwe', 'piss', 'poor', 'acting', 'even', 'somewhat', 'decent', 'actors', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'have', 'ranked', 'videogame', 'movie', 'right', 'bottom', 'list.If', 'absolutly', 'love', 'vampires', 'absolutly', 'love', 'looking', 'beautiful', 'women', 'screen', 'then', 'means', 'see', 'movie', 'few', 'hours', 'brainless', 'entertainment', 'otherwise', 'do', 'favor', 'avoid', 'movie', 'costs.GotMyOrangeCrush']",N/A

He claims his heart is in the right place, but all he does to back up that claim is throw poorly constructed one-dimensional characters into a story filled with what he can figure out in rotting SFX, blood-spurts, and completely random gratuitous sex scenes!  The best part is that he doesn't let get ideas like ""exposition"" or ""character development"" get in the way... no, it's a straight through, opening shot-to-closing shot heyday of complete ineptitude!Thus, it's an entertaining good time... if your mind is in the right place.Along to share the joke with us are a mixed cast, everyone from the action-movie-star-overmelodramatic Michelle Rodriguez to the thespian Ben Kingsley himself.  You can basically measure each actor's ability in this movie not by how they deal with the material, but how large each one's smirk is throughout the proceedings.  Billy Zane, Michael Madsen, Ben Kingsley, and Meat Loaf all run their lines behind a half-tilted curve of lips, winking at us with their visages, playing a game that Uwe Boll never gets.The rest of the actors run around spouting one-liners at an incredible rate... when not engaging in another blood-fest.  Hey I got to admit, that blood was ENTERTAINING blood... only it wasn't ""cool"" or ""awesome"" or ""gory"" or ""amazing effects"" or ""interesting"" or ""crazy"" or any of that... just blatantly, aggressively pointless (everything you've come to expect from these movies).  The sex scene was almost as pointless as the one in Alone in the Dark... ALMOST.  There was actually written character development leading up to it in the script, it's just that Boll decided to direct around such a use and just lay the lines out and get right to the guy ripping Kristanna Loken's shirt off.  Compare to Alone in the Dark, where the sex scene literally comes from nowhere, and we see that little Uwe may be improving a bit.  Heck, soon he might make movies that wouldn't offend people if they were straight-to-DVD!Also, I have to admit: this movie is probably one of the cleanest videogame adaptations, not because it follows the game (I have no idea), but because it literally plays like one watching a videogame.  The dialog and exposition is roughly the level you can find from your local Dungeons and Dragons Dungeon Master... assuming he's a beginning DM, not one of those that actually exploits the intricacies of the game to make an interesting story.  ""There are three artifacts you must find that can form a union!"" says the old gypsy.  Oh boy, harken sires, I hear a quest afoot!  The acting is like that voice-acting you get in videogames: say the line with only the appeal to emotion, and move on.  Like this: This movie CAN be...very good if I...pause between WORDS and ...fluctuate my voice...I think the shining star of this movie is actually Billy Zane.  For some reason, his role totally works, and he ends up being an interesting character.  Of course that's probably because he only has, like, two scenes, and both of them are as a sarcastic vampire.

643355,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00005JOVM,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[4, 4]","Bloodrayne (Uwe Boll, 2005)Every once in a while you run across a director of truly bad movies, but every time he takes on a project, he does something that, despite your knowing the movie is going to be even worse than the last godawful piece of crap he released, still makes you want to see it.In this case, Uwe Boll, responsible for such execrable movies as Alone in the Dark and House of the Dead, somehow managed to rope in a cast it's quite hard to believe were willing to take a chance on a videogame-based Uwe Boll movie. Topping the list of ""what were they thinking?"" actors here is Ben Kingsley. Can you believe this guy played Gandhi? Michael Madsen (Reservoir Dogs), Billy Zane (Posse), Michelle Rodriguez (Girlfight), Udo Kier (Suspiria), and a number of others come along for the ride as well. I can't believe all of them were that strapped for cash. All of them are billed under TV actress Kristianna Loken (who last saw the big screen while playing the bad boss monster in Terminator 3), in the movie's title role, a half-vampire half-human who's out to kill Kingsley's character, Kagan, because Kagan killed Rayne's mother. The fact that he's also her father doesn't seem to make her question her motivation much. Not that anyone in this movie has enough of a character to really have much motivation.That doesn't seem to bother Boll, who cuts this movie from exactly the same cloth as his others: lots of action, hints of sex that might actually be interesting if he cared enough to explore those scenes, a useless script, camerawork that's just this side of competent, and Boll's somewhat impressive ability to wring the worst possible acting out of anyone he casts.And yet, despite all this, the most depressing thing about Bloodrayne is that the movie actually did well enough overseas (predictably, it flopped like a nightmare in America, making two and a half million, well under one-fifth of its budget) that Vivendi greenlighted Bloodrayne II. At least none of the original cast, including Loken, were hard up enough to sign on for what cannot help but be another Boll monstrosity.

Ten gallons of manure.I don't care how much they dress up the DVD version of this movie, it won't change the fact that it's terrible.A couple of tid-bits about this disaster:1. It's made by Uwe Boll, helmer of two of the worst movies I've ever seen in 'House of the Dead' and 'Alone in the Dark.'2. It was admitted by Boll himself the he didn't cast the movie until TWO WEEKS before filming began. What he wound up with are a bunch of ""names"" that had a hole in their schedule and showed up for a quick paycheck and a free trip to Romania. It shows too, nobody looks even half-interested in making an honest effort.3. Will Sanderson and Michael Madsen were reportly completely drunk through the whole production.4. Ben Kingsley, who previously had to deal with Madsen on the film 'Species' refused to even be on the same set with him.5. In the harem scene with Meatloaf, those are HONEST TO GOD, 100% FULL-BLOODED ROMANIAN PROSTITUTES. Boll apparently couldn't afford real actresses, so he ordered out for the real thing.This is a disaster from front to back. I'll give it this though, it's better then his last two films. 'Bloodrayne', at least, is a little bit unintentionally funny. Even having said that though, I could never recommend anyone ever see this.

And before you say, ""well, duh!"", lemme tell you it's not for the reasons you may think.  Ya see, Uwe Boll has a reputation in the filmworld.  Supposedly he's the worst director out there right now.  It's not often that a director comes along that both filmgoers and critics single out as being absolutely terrible.  Naturally this intrigued me.  And after all, who could be worse than Michael Bay?  Bloodrayne just looked stupid from the getgo. If you ask me, making a movie from the premise of a friggin' video game is a stupid idea no matter how you cut it.  Does the film suck?  Of course it does.  But with Boll's reputation I was expecting more(or less?).  With all I have read about this guy I was expecting a bad movie to a dimension of which bad movies have never ventured to.  Something just so unredeemable and abyssmal that you just can't put it into words.  I wasn't expecting to like it, nor was I expecting a ""so bad it's good"" kinda thing, but I was expecting something unique.  Maybe I had my expectations too high(or low).  What I got was a piece of crap typical of any modern vampire or horror film Hollywood puts out anymore.  This movie would have sucked , Boll directing or not.  Ben Kingsley(that's oscar winner Ben Kingsley) looks rather embarassed.  Madsen looks pissed, drunk and bored.  The chick isn't anywhere near as tantalizing as you're supposed to believe.  Who the hell knows what Billy Zane's character was in it for?  Meatloaf hams it up and looks rather silly in a very small part.  I know he'd do anything for love, but he shouldn't have done that.  There's a bonus feature called Dinner With Uwe Boll.  In this fun little feature two bored looking interviewers talk to Boll about his career while they slurp down something that looks like chinese takeout.  They're all drinking glasses of wine too, but Uwe also has a Diet Mountain Dew.  There's something amusing and disturbing about this interview.  Boll talks so highly of his career and it's weird to watch everyone eat.  Why two stars?  Well, if anything good about Boll can be said, he certainly isn't shy when it comes to onscreen gore.  Kinda cheesy gore, but that's the most fun kind, isn't it?  Plus, Boll hasn't remade a classic horror film under the arrogance that he could somehow do it better.  I'd have to say that if Michael Bay still lives and breathes, Boll isn't the worst director there is.

643365,A3JTBJC5WSEZ7Q,B00005JOVM,Thomas M. Sipos,"[0, 1]","Yes, I was aware of Uwe Boll's (well deserved) reputation for bad filmmaking. But it's been many years since I suffered through one of his films. And since BLOODRAYNE had vampires, the sexy Michelle Rodriguez,Meat Loaf(my favorite singer), and Michael Madsen (pretty good inSpeciesandFrankenstein), and since I was able to buy a used copy on Amazon for only one penny, I gave it a shot.I thought, how bad could it be?Pretty bad.Part of the trouble is that BLOODRAYNE is based on a video game. Not being a gamer, I didn't know that, though I knew that Boll specializes in video game films.Films based on video games are typically stiflingly dull, because there's nothing substantive in a game to base a film on. No deep stories or fully-fleshed characters. Nothing but a series of colorful, but soulless, combat situations.BLOODRAYNE is mostly just a series of battles. Lots of CGI effects. Tons of hacked limbs and torsos. Gushers of blood spurting from wounded warriors. Countless faces transforming into vampires. But there's so much of it, and the ""characters"" are so thinly written, that pretty soon all this combat becomes mind-numbingly repetitive to watch.Michelle Rogriguez does a dreadful accent. I think it's supposed to be Old English, sort of. It's an inconsistent accent, coming and going. Nobody else in BLOODRAYNE has her accent.Accents are as inconsistent as the costuming. Meat Loaf has a sort of 18th century French wig, whereas other characters are dressed in medieval garb, or ancient barbarian garb, or even what looks like a 19th century, braided, Chinese ponytail.Meat Loaf has very little screen time.

643368,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JOVM,Tsuyoshi,"[13, 17]","Kristanna Loken, probably best known for her killing machine role in `Terminator 3,' is the titular Rayne, a vengeful `dhampir' (half human, half vampire) who is determined to kill the vampire king Kagan played by Oscar winner Sir Ben Kingsley. The supporting cast includes Billy Zane, Michelle Rodriguez, Matthew Davis, Michael Madsen, Will Sanderson, Meat Loaf, Michael Pare, Udo Kier and Geraldine Chaplin. These names, though admittedly not completely A-list, are still impressive enough, and with the deft hand of director who knows how to tell a good story, the film could be an entertaining action, if not the greatest movie of the year.No such luck here, for the film is directed by Uwe Boll, whose totally inept filmmaking reminded me of one legendary director Edward Wood Jr. and his `Plan 9 From Outer Space.' There is no consistent tone or logics behind his storytelling, and no reasonable editing can be found in the sword-fight sequences in `BloodRayne' in which we must be satisfied with some so-so images of Romania, the choppily edited incomprehensible `stunts,' and occasional blood splattering.It is very sad to see these professional actors doing only half-hearted works. Most actors especially Madsen, Rodriguez, and Kingsley are doing the laziest work in their career, as if sleepwalking in the set. Perhaps they were, dreaming of the paycheck. Loken's character is certainly sexy, but her stilted acting with her eyes wide open is much worse and annoying than Milla Jovovich in `Resident Evil.'I don't know why, but some directors are so lucky that they can find their jobs after making TWO fiascos. I am talking about Mr. Uwe Boll, German director of this film, who previously made two awful based-on-video-game films, namely `House of the Dead' and `Alone in the Dark.' If the baseball rules should apply to filmmaking, `BloodRayne,' another terrible horror film, should be the three-strikes-and-you're-out film for him. The fact is, the star of `BloodRayne' seems to have agreed to appear in his film again.

Sadly, it wasn't even that... this film bottoms out worse than even Ultraviolet.First off, let me say that I have only watched the ""Unrated Directer's Cut"" edition and not any other versions available. That said, I have yet to ever see a hollywood film of such a thoroughly malodourous calibre, in every conceivable aspect, as this.Any film that - immediately following the climax and in lieu of a denouement - has almost ten minutes of montage recap consisting purely of every (low-budget) decapitation, disemboweling, squirting artery, blood-spraying torso, blood-drinking, and dismembered body part shot in the entire movie (as if for the sole purpose of explaining the ""Blood"" in the film and game's title) deserves to be avoided like the plague. I (scarasm!) love the shot of the disemboweled corpse on the floor (guts splayed everywhere, immobile, torso half-removed) where the frenzied fighters like flailing idiots are still senselessly hacking at the corpse in the middle of a pitch battle. There was so much senseless gore in this movie that I found myself thrown into uncontrollable fits of laughter. This should give you a clue as to the equally senseless pacing of the film. Then again, the plot is filled with so many holes (and seems so incomplete) that it would be charity to say that there was enough story for there to have been pacing at all. There is absolutely nothing in the film that hangs together properly, in any semblance of good crafting.The action is poorly executed, immediately recognisable as ripped off from every other action movie, and poorly choreographed. The swordfighting is even worse (and rather slow), seemingly slapped together by 6-year-olds with sticks. Only the climactic fight between Lokken and Kingsley is even half-decently choreographed and somewhat entertaining.The dialogue could also have been written by children, the acting is flat and unappealing with inconsistent accents - especially from actors you know could have done better - the costumes unoriginal and unconvincing. I still find it odd to hear american accents in the middle of any medieval ""epic"" and I always shall. As for the musical score, it is uncoordinated with the screen action, nor is particularly memorable. The incidental music and the main themes are unsuccessfully experimental, even though you can tell that the composer somewhat sincerely attempted to write a good ""epic"" score to lift up the incredibly poor quality of the film.  Sadly, the score overwhelms the screen action at many a place and runs amok trying to be Wagner, Mahler, and Berlioz at once while forgetting it is supposed to be a film score.Someone above mentioned the senseless soft-core porn in this film (it's even more soft-core than in Underworld Evolution, and less tactfully filmed) - unless you're looking for soft-core porn involving Kristanna Lokken or Romanian prostitutes, I must reiterate: avoid this film like the plague.",1,Wow.

The characters were like cardboard cutouts or paper dolls, pretty to look at but no substance whatsoever. The director and script writer for this film should just give it up and try something else, because neither one has any talent whatsoever.The story was all over the place, jumping from scene to scene without a smooth transition between them and without any logic to me at all. The director and script writer assumed I suppose that all the viewers were mind readers and could tell by looking what was going on and why.I love usually vampire movies and I have watched just about every vampire movie made. But this movie is by far and away the worst I have ever seen. It's a pity too, because it could have been soooo much more than it was.I saw this at the theater. Believe me, seeing it on the big screen didn't make it better, it just made my eyes and ears bleed sooner. I sat there while the credits rolled in stunned disbelief at the complete mess they made of this movie. I was so upset over the quality of this piece of trash, I asked for a refund from the manager of the theater. Yuck!",1,Absolutely..

While he seems to always take the worst scripts he can find, he also has the edge and the eye to pull them off in an entertaining way (though not a particularly interesting one) If you're not looking for plot and you want a monster movie with a lot of action and Indiana Jones sort of booby traps and creepy crawlies, go ahead and rent this one.  It'll pass the time and you may even think it's pretty fun.
