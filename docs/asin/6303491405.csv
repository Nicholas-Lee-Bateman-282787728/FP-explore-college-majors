377725,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,6303491405,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[3, 3]","This film was really good. Writer and director Jamaa Fanaka was still a student at UCLA and Penitentiary was the first starring vehicle for former disc jockey and future evangelist Leon Isaac Kennedy. If you don't know the story it goes like this; Too Sweet (Leon Isaac Kennedy) is charged with murder, and convicted despite his innocence; he's shipped off to a run-down prison where Jesse Amos (Donovan Womack), one of the prisoners, lords it over the other inmates. Too Sweet ends up sharing a cell with Half Dead (Badja Djola), a violent lunatic who is one of Jesse's musclemen. Too Sweet refuses to buckle under to the intimidation dished out by Half Dead and his cronies, even after seeing how they've ""turned out"" Eugene (Thommy Pollard), another new fish who has become Jesse's sexual slave. Forced to defend himself even though he hates violence, Too Sweet displays a genuine talent for fighting, and is persuaded to take part in the prison boxing tournament, where he could win a night with a woman or even his freedom. However, Too Sweet sees the deck may be stacked against him when he finds out his opponent is the horrible Half Dead.After watching this I found the fight between Too sweet and Half dead particularly interesting. Through out this film you will also find some of the characters to be animated with there jail house humor and realism through others such as Too Sweet's trainer. The cinematography wasn't bad also. The use of the wide angle lenses to give the viewer a distorted view was impressive and the way some characters address the camera was interesting and strange at the same time. Some people say that part two is even funnier and I might give it a try later in the future.This exploitation is a masterpiece, PENITENTIARY (1979) is especially worth watching because of its strange, neo-realism.  An almost all-unknown cast (that also contributes a lot to the movie's appeal), realistic 1970s African American dialog and backgrounds, realistic and mind-bending scenes of perverse violence and huge doses of humor make this a blast in every department. It's a must-see if you're a fan of this genre and one to check out.",4,I can defiantly see why this is one of John Singleton's favorite films,1160352000,"10 9, 2006",2006,2155,"['film', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'Writer', 'director', 'Jamaa', 'Fanaka', 'was', 'still', 'student', 'UCLA', 'Penitentiary', 'was', 'first', 'starring', 'vehicle', 'former', 'disc', 'jockey', 'future', 'evangelist', 'Leon', 'Isaac', 'Kennedy', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'story', 'Too', 'Sweet', 'Leon', 'Isaac', 'Kennedy', 'charged', 'murder', 'convicted', 'innocence', 'shipped', 'off', 'run-down', 'prison', 'where', 'Jesse', 'Amos', 'Donovan', 'Womack', 'one', 'prisoners', 'lords', 'other', 'inmates', 'Too', 'Sweet', 'up', 'sharing', 'cell', 'Half', 'Dead', 'Badja', 'Djola', 'violent', 'lunatic', 'who', 'one', 'Jesse', 'musclemen', 'Too', 'Sweet', 'refuses', 'buckle', 'intimidation', 'dished', 'out', 'Half', 'Dead', 'cronies', 'even', 'seeing', 'how', ""'ve"", 'turned', 'out', 'Eugene', 'Thommy', 'Pollard', 'new', 'fish', 'who', 'become', 'Jesse', 'sexual', 'slave', 'Forced', 'defend', 'even', 'violence', 'Too', 'Sweet', 'genuine', 'talent', 'fighting', 'persuaded', 'take', 'part', 'prison', 'boxing', 'tournament', 'where', 'could', 'win', 'night', 'woman', 'even', 'freedom', 'However', 'Too', 'Sweet', 'deck', 'may', 'be', 'stacked', 'when', 'out', 'opponent', 'horrible', 'Half', 'Dead.After', 'watching', 'found', 'fight', 'Too', 'sweet', 'Half', 'dead', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'film', 'will', 'also', 'find', 'characters', 'be', 'animated', 'jail', 'house', 'humor', 'realism', 'others', 'such', 'Too', 'Sweet', 'trainer', 'cinematography', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'also', 'use', 'wide', 'angle', 'lenses', 'give', 'viewer', 'distorted', 'view', 'was', 'impressive', 'way', 'characters', 'address', 'camera', 'was', 'interesting', 'strange', 'same', 'time', 'people', 'say', 'part', 'two', 'even', 'funnier', 'might', 'give', 'try', 'later', 'future.This', 'exploitation', 'masterpiece', 'PENITENTIARY', '1979', 'especially', 'worth', 'watching', 'strange', 'neo-realism', 'almost', 'all-unknown', 'cast', 'also', 'lot', 'movie', 'appeal', 'realistic', '1970s', 'African', 'American', 'dialog', 'backgrounds', 'realistic', 'mind-bending', 'scenes', 'perverse', 'violence', 'huge', 'doses', 'humor', 'make', 'blast', 'department', 'must-see', ""'re"", 'fan', 'genre', 'one', 'check', 'out']",N/A

377727,A1NGWU5RWYVKUL,6303491405,J. Lewis,"[1, 1]","""Penitentiary"" appeared in 1979, at the end of the blaxploitation movie era, and has some of the hallmarks the genre: a few wooden performances and rather poor production values. It's nonetheless an excellent film. T Donovan Womack as ""Jesse"" the prison shot-caller, Badja Djola as ""Half Dead"" and a few others compensate for the wooden performances. The real authenticity of the movie compensates for it low-budget production values. Wherever director-writer Jamaa Fanaka got it, he clearly had reliable information about his topic.The theme running through ""Penitentiary"" is a prison gang's attempt to convert a young new inmate who they dub ""Too Sweet"" into their sex-slave through rape, an effort foiled when the intended victim defeats and in turn sodomizes his anointed rapist, ""Half-Dead."" A sub-plot involves the relationship between the shot-caller ""Jesse"" and his prison wife Eugene, renamed ""Jenny"" after he is turned-out. It closely follows the realities of prison sex and sexuality, including the nuances of how sex, violence and love can get fused and confused. Thus we see a scene of extreme violence when ""Jesse"" brutally beats ""Jenny"" for standing over instead of sitting down on the toilet while urinating -- defying his role as ""wife"" and substitute female by committing a uniquely masculine act -- followed later by ""Jesse's"" half-apology in which he tells ""Jenny"" that ""you all I got."" The hard, brutal and ruthless prison gang leader had fallen in love with his victim. At another moment, one inmate quibs to another who's been knocked out in an organized boxing match, ""how am I gonna get some pu--y with you laying on your back?""""Penitentiary"" is full of moments like these which anyone familiar with the research on prison sexuality will recognize as absolutely true. These are easy to miss or misunderstand for those who are not familiar with the nuances of prison realities, or who have been mislead about it by some academic misunderstandings of it inspired by feminist theory applied to male prison situations (""rape is not about sex, it's about power"" -- BS, at least in prison!).

Back in the day when me and my buddies would sit around my 13 inch TV set smoking, drinking, checking out this flick on video tape and rewinding it over and over to the funny parts like the brother with the broken cigarette sticking out his ear; the part when Big Jess clocks ""Genie"" for standing up to use the toilet; the part where the brothers are out in the yard dancing; the part where an inmate planning to rape another inmate says to his partner: ""relax, Dead. Wait a few days, so we can set the booty up right.""This is ""the"" buddy movie for me growing up in my late teens. Basically, it's about a brother named Too Sweet who is set up and goes down for killing a racist hillbilly. Once he's sent up to the 'pen, the film becomes about survival and maintaining his sense of who and what he is against predators, like Half-Dead, probably the ugliest dude in the history of motion pictures, and homosexuals who have surrendered their manhood. But Too Sweet is a fighter both in his cell and also in the boxing-for-booty tournaments that take place in the film.

No, it's not the one with Mr. T (penitentiary II) or that horrible one with the midget. (penintiary III) This is the one with  the original too sweet, half dead and seldom seen. The movie is low budget  and cheap, try to find the boom mike in some scenes, but that's not what  impresses me. It's the fact it transends the usual blacksploitation  stereotypes. They are still there but also there is also a lot of truth  within it.  The seldom seen character is no characture he's a real. (He  play's too sweet trainer.) I was amazed at how realistic his portrayal of  an institutionalized convict was. We really get to understan him and why he  does what he does. Another interesting thing about this movie is the the  character half dead (Badja Djola) was hilarious. (You want some Mr.  goodbar) You might remember  him from the  dozens of movies afterward (a  rage in harlem, mississippi burning and other films) I also liked the fact  that this was funny(mostly) but it also was serious at times.
