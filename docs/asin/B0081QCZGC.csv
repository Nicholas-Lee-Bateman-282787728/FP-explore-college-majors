This cartoon, because it's a CARTOON children, is offensive and racist. It has no positive factors whatsoever!. I could barely understand what the poorly drawn SQUIDS were talking about. Yes I said SQUIDS! How absurd? The sherrif is a geneticaly grown... needless to say it's just soooo bad it's not funny. If the most absurd thing that could possibley happen apeals to you then you have a very unrefined sense of humor. Some day you will cringe at the fact you liked this racist unintellagable garbage fest. I don't mean to sound harsh but come on! If this was based in an innercity neighborhood, that was named SQUIGGERS. It wouldn't have lasted 2 episodes. Since when is it ok to be racist to white folks? I digress.
