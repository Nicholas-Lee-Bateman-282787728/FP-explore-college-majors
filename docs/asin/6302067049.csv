So I was delighted to find this movie at the Video Store thanks to Tom the guy who works there and is a ""good bloke"" . Ms. Post plays a prostitute  and when one of her clients is murdered in her home  she and the  client's wife Cindy Williams play detective and try to solve the murder. Ms. Post appears in some great outfits in this film which alone makes it worth watching!!!",5,This Is a Very Funny Movie!!!

I used to have the VHS copy and remember the tag line on the box, ""A Beverly Hills housewife. A Hollywood hooker. This could get tricky."" Too bad they didn't keep that on the DVD cover. Cindy Williams (Laverne & Shirley) and Markie Post (Night Court) were perfectly cast and had great chemistry together. Catherine Todson (Williams) has it all. A loving, successful husband named Donald (John Ritter in a short cameo role), a grand house in Beverly Hills, dinner parties, Godiva chocolates, you name it. But Catherine is about to find out that her life wasn't as perfect as she would have liked to think when her husband is found murdered in a hooker's (Post) apartment in Hollywood. When Catherine decides to ""get in touch with her anger"" by the advice of her therapist, she confronts her her husband's mistress and things just seem to get worse (and funnier) from that point on. The two women decide to team up through the streets of L.A. to find out the truth about what happened to Donald. If you are thinking that these women will eventually begin to form a friendship (think of Outrageous Fortune with Shelley Long and Bette Midler) you would be right. Williams and Post each shine and are comical and fun to watch. While the concept would probably never happen in real life, it works for this movie! Check it out, you will not be disappointed and it's for sale at a great price! It is much funnier than a lot of movies coming out today.",4,Funny TV movie with the charming Cindy Williams and Markie Post,1204156800,"02 28, 2008",2008,1532,"[""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'someone', 'remembered', 'what', 'great', 'movie', 'was', 'decided', 'put', 'DVD', 'used', 'have', 'VHS', 'copy', 'remember', 'tag', 'line', 'box', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'housewife', 'Hollywood', 'hooker', 'could', 'get', 'tricky', 'bad', 'did', ""n't"", 'keep', 'DVD', 'cover', 'Cindy', 'Williams', 'Laverne', 'Shirley', 'Markie', 'Post', 'Night', 'Court', 'were', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'had', 'great', 'chemistry', 'together', 'Catherine', 'Todson', 'Williams', 'loving', 'successful', 'husband', 'named', 'Donald', 'John', 'Ritter', 'short', 'cameo', 'role', 'grand', 'house', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'dinner', 'parties', 'Godiva', 'name', 'Catherine', 'find', 'out', 'life', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'perfect', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'think', 'when', 'husband', 'found', 'murdered', 'hooker', 'Post', 'apartment', 'Hollywood', 'When', 'Catherine', 'get', 'touch', 'anger', 'advice', 'therapist', 'husband', 'mistress', 'things', 'just', 'seem', 'get', 'worse', 'funnier', 'point', 'two', 'women', 'decide', 'team', 'up', 'streets', 'L.A.', 'find', 'out', 'truth', 'what', 'happened', 'Donald', 'are', 'thinking', 'women', 'will', 'eventually', 'begin', 'form', 'friendship', 'think', 'Outrageous', 'Fortune', 'Shelley', 'Long', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'would', 'be', 'right', 'Williams', 'Post', 'shine', 'are', 'comical', 'fun', 'watch', 'concept', 'would', 'probably', 'never', 'happen', 'real', 'life', 'movie', 'Check', 'out', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'sale', 'great', 'price', 'much', 'funnier', 'lot', 'movies', 'coming', 'out', 'today']",N/A

Everything is very simple.  You don't have to think.  I would have given it five stars if Markie Post had lost just a little of the outfit she was wearing but she is hot anyway.  Also if she had lost any of that outfit the rating would have went to R pretty fast.  If you want to see something well written, funny and you can just sit back and enjoy then this is it.  If you want deep thought then watch 2001 A Space Odyssey.
