837950,AFVROUVTT63XM,B0002JP48C,"Dr. H. A. Jones ""Howard Jones""","[0, 0]","Molly Lasch (Brandy Ledford) has just been released from prison after serving a sentence for killing her husband. An old school friend and investigative reporter Fran Simmons (Laura Leighton) is sent by her editor to write a human interest story about Molly. Secretly, Fran does not believe Molly killed her husband and wants to investigate the story. She is reluctant to re-visit her home town however because her father was accused of embezzling half a million dollars from the library fund. Fran finds that Dr Gary Lasch (Steve Archer) is one of two doctors at the Lasch Institute who was murdered in the space of a few weeks. Lasch and the other doctor were both having an affair with Ann Marie Scalli (Ona Grauer). The head of the Lasch Institute now is Dr Peter Gaynes (Gedeon Burkhard) assisted by Nick Whitehall (Andrew Jackson) whose wife Jenna (Anne Openshaw) was also a schoolfriend of Fran's.As Fran investigates, it emerges that there is a lot more to the story than first appears. There is a young girl in a coma that seems to have been induced by medical negligence. Molly's housekeeper Edna Barry (Paula Shaw) has a retarded son who also was a friend of Molly's and frequent visitor to the house. It's a complicated story but it made for a very entertaining thriller: I won't reveal any of the other twists in the plot.",5,An entertaining thriller based on Mary Higgins Clark's book,1350777600,"10 21, 2012",2012,1335,"['Molly', 'Lasch', 'Brandy', 'Ledford', 'just', 'been', 'released', 'prison', 'serving', 'sentence', 'killing', 'husband', 'old', 'school', 'friend', 'investigative', 'reporter', 'Fran', 'Simmons', 'Laura', 'Leighton', 'sent', 'editor', 'write', 'human', 'interest', 'story', 'Molly', 'Secretly', 'Fran', 'not', 'believe', 'Molly', 'killed', 'husband', 'investigate', 'story', 'reluctant', 're-visit', 'home', 'town', 'however', 'father', 'was', 'accused', 'embezzling', 'million', 'dollars', 'library', 'fund', 'Fran', 'Dr', 'Gary', 'Lasch', 'Steve', 'Archer', 'one', 'two', 'doctors', 'Lasch', 'Institute', 'who', 'was', 'murdered', 'space', 'few', 'weeks', 'Lasch', 'other', 'doctor', 'were', 'having', 'affair', 'Ann', 'Marie', 'Scalli', 'Ona', 'Grauer', 'head', 'Lasch', 'Institute', 'now', 'Dr', 'Peter', 'Gaynes', 'Gedeon', 'Burkhard', 'assisted', 'Nick', 'Whitehall', 'Andrew', 'Jackson', 'wife', 'Jenna', 'Anne', 'Openshaw', 'was', 'also', 'schoolfriend', ""Fran's.As"", 'Fran', 'lot', 'more', 'story', 'first', 'young', 'girl', 'coma', 'have', 'been', 'induced', 'medical', 'negligence', 'Molly', 'housekeeper', 'Edna', 'Barry', 'Paula', 'Shaw', 'retarded', 'son', 'who', 'also', 'was', 'friend', 'Molly', 'frequent', 'visitor', 'house', 'complicated', 'story', 'made', 'very', 'entertaining', 'thriller', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'other', 'twists', 'plot']",N/A

WE'LL MEET AGAIN is an okay entry but it's cast isn't up to the material; most of them perform lethargically and don't compel us to feel for their characters.  Brandy Ledford plays a sexy young woman who is sentenced for the death of her doctor husband. She can't remember what went on the night of the murders.  Laura Leighton plays the plucky reporter whose roots go back to the town where this murder took place and she finds herself trying to help Ledford find out who murdered her husband.  Lots of red herrings and some confusing subplots give us several suspects, but with such listless direction and acting, the movie suffers and the viewer is left to muddle through the proceedings.",3,WEARY  WHODUNIT,1127606400,"09 25, 2005",2005,817,"['Mary', 'Higgins', 'Clark', 'one', 'world', 'most', 'read', 'suspense', 'writers', 'made', 'TV', 'movies', 'books', 'have', 'surfaced', 'WE', 'MEET', 'AGAIN', 'okay', 'entry', 'cast', ""n't"", 'up', 'material', 'most', 'perform', 'lethargically', 'do', ""n't"", 'compel', 'feel', 'characters', 'Brandy', 'Ledford', 'sexy', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'sentenced', 'death', 'doctor', 'husband', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'what', 'went', 'night', 'murders', 'Laura', 'Leighton', 'plucky', 'reporter', 'roots', 'go', 'back', 'town', 'where', 'murder', 'took', 'place', 'trying', 'help', 'Ledford', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'murdered', 'husband', 'Lots', 'red', 'herrings', 'confusing', 'subplots', 'give', 'several', 'suspects', 'such', 'listless', 'direction', 'acting', 'movie', 'suffers', 'viewer', 'left', 'muddle', 'proceedings']",N/A
