493780,A3XIJ6YQMIS4R,B000006FV7,"Read Sonja ""nonseqtr""","[1, 1]","Reckless Kelly is pretty much on par with Young Einstein, although a bit more juvenile in places. I really liked both of these films and I think it is important to remember that these were independently made and not just churned out by a studio. Yes the humor is puerile and juvenile for the most part, yes the story doesn't make a lot of sense if you look at it too closely. However, as a just for fun film it can be entertaining. Reasons to like this film? Eye candy. Cute animals. Random sound effects. Fun music. There are also some interesting plot themes such as the Kelly Gang, the animal sanctuary, towing the island to Japan and the video store location, not to mention Shakespeare. There are funny throw away gags and although some of the humor is as I mentioned previously there are quite a few levels of humor running throughout. The Brit bashing is so over the top that you can't really take it seriously, having the bad guy be British is obviously a convenient plot device and this IS an Australian film so it isn't totally without context. There are plenty of jokes which make fun of Hollywood and the So Cal social scene, not to mention the expectations of movie goers in general. So basically, taken as a regular film it is simple with a weak plot and low humor, however taken as an example of alternative film it offers a fun lightweight story that makes fun of making movies and has many layers of humor. Most of all it doesn't take itself seriously. It even pokes fun at itself.

493782,A1EB3EO0NZ1LO,B000006FV7,The Movie Critic,"[4, 21]","Surely the makers Reckless Kelly were capable of making something better than this mess. It's a childish, lame attempt at a comedy. The main problem is the script. It isn't funny at all. I don't remember even laughing once. Lame scene after lame scene rolls on by and you wonder if the movie is ever going to pick up the pace. It never does. It just keeps going downhill. Also the attempts at trying to get a laugh out of the audience are so forced it's ridiculous. For example, Kelly can't stand flies, so whenever one is buzzing around he shoots it. Mildly amusing the first time, but it wears thin around the third or fourth time.Also the plot is very confused. The island the Kelly's live on is being sold. To keep it, they must pay a million dollars. So what can they do? They can't rob the banks in Australia and keep the money for themselves. They only rob banks and give the money to the poor. So Kelly goes all the way to America to rob banks. For some reason, it's ok to keep the money from the banks in America. But while over there, the plot looses it's way when Kelly becomes a moviestar to get the money. All of a sudden, he's no longer a bank robber anymore and the character really changes. It's all pointless from there on.In short, Reckless Kelly is a confused, disorganized mess. It's a big disappointment for Australian movies and is not worth watching.",1,A big disappointment.,977443200,"12 22, 2000",2000,1373,"['Surely', 'makers', 'Reckless', 'Kelly', 'were', 'capable', 'making', 'something', 'better', 'mess', 'childish', 'lame', 'attempt', 'comedy', 'main', 'problem', 'script', ""n't"", 'funny', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'even', 'laughing', 'once', 'Lame', 'scene', 'lame', 'scene', 'rolls', 'wonder', 'movie', 'ever', 'going', 'pick', 'up', 'pace', 'never', 'just', 'going', 'downhill', 'Also', 'attempts', 'trying', 'get', 'laugh', 'audience', 'are', 'so', 'forced', 'ridiculous', 'example', 'Kelly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'flies', 'so', 'whenever', 'one', 'buzzing', 'Mildly', 'amusing', 'first', 'time', 'thin', 'third', 'fourth', 'plot', 'very', 'confused', 'island', 'Kelly', 'live', 'being', 'sold', 'keep', 'must', 'pay', 'million', 'dollars', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'ca', ""n't"", 'rob', 'banks', 'Australia', 'keep', 'money', 'only', 'rob', 'banks', 'give', 'money', 'poor', 'So', 'Kelly', 'way', 'America', 'rob', 'banks', 'reason', 'ok', 'keep', 'money', 'banks', 'America', 'there', 'plot', 'way', 'when', 'Kelly', 'moviestar', 'get', 'money', 'sudden', 'no', 'longer', 'bank', 'robber', 'anymore', 'character', 'really', 'changes', 'pointless', 'on.In', 'short', 'Reckless', 'Kelly', 'confused', 'disorganized', 'mess', 'big', 'disappointment', 'Australian', 'movies', 'not', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A
