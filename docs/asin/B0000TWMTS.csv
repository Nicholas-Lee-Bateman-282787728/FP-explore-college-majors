An unfunny satire on the ""Ghetto Fabulous"" lifestyle, this film is as offensive as an Amos N' Andy episode. The plot revolves around two gold-digging B.A.P.S. (Halle Berry, Natalie Deselle) and their quest for fame and fortune in the music world. They dump their jerricurl pimp-suit wearing scrub boyfriends and head out to Hollywood on a quest for stardom. After failing to make it in an audition as video dancers they run into an ailing white millionaire who wants to leave his riches to them. ???? This is where the story makes a WRONG turn. In the millionaires mansion the B.A.P.S. act like slaves in the Master's plantation and the movie goes from awful to abysmal.Like Meteor Man, Townsend does not understand the culture of the lifestyle he's making fun of in his film. And that is the downfall of this satire. Townsend doesn't know Baps, from hoochies, baby mamas, pigeons, or chicken heads. Likewise he doesn't know the difference between Macks, Pimps, Hustlers, B-Boys, or No Job Scrubs. To make fun of a culture in satire you must live in it and be a part of it. Ironically, Townsend is the one now doing the ""Hollywood Shuffle"" he poked fun at over 10 years ago directing a movie so similar to the satirical ""Jivetime Jimmy's Revenge"" It's scary.Halle Berry says she ""was having fun"" doing this movie; it wasn't fun for me. This is one of her worst performances. She and Desselle are modern day mammies. I was embarrassed to see her in this movie; she is far above trash like this. Robert Townsend should bow his head in shame for directing this modern minstrel show. It disheartens me to know that African-Americans could make something so racist and offensive after many have died fighting against negative images like this for decades.
