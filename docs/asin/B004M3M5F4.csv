1419645,AGYBNE1KH6HR7,B004M3M5F4,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","All one can say is that (IMHO) ""Home Improvement"" was a comedy classic -- but one with an intelligent story line behind it.  The whole premise of the show is that an ex-hardware salesman gets his own handy-man show (ala Bob Vila), calls the show ""Tool Time"" and goes on to become the most inept and accident prone ""unhandy man"" anyone could ever imagine on cable television.On ""Tool Time"", Tim Allen's character doles out advice about projects from installing a shelf or a wall outlet to creating an entire ""man's"" bathroom complete with built-in television and beer cooler.  Tim is usually saved from some near disaster of his own making by his basically insecure but really proficient assistant Al Borland, an old fashioned midwest kind of guy who just happens to only wear flannel shirts.The other part of the program mainly takes place at Tim's home in suburban Detroit with his wife Jill, their three extremely active sons, and their neighbor Wilson who provides advice coupled with philosophy to the Taylors over the wood fence dividing their back yards.  Tim builds hot rod cars in HIS garage and tries to add ""more power"" to the home appliances while his loving wife tries to cope and keep it all under control while raising their three sons.  What shines through most of all is the genuine affection between Tim and Jill set against all little and big situations that occur in any average family.The show ran for eight years, so you watch the boys grow up to young adulthood; Jill stars out as a free-lance magazine writer then goes back to college to earn a degree as a professional counsellor; and finally Tim's little show is swallowed up by ""corporate bureaucratics"" who buy out the tool manufacturing company that sponsored ""Tool Time"", and take the program out of Tim's hands.""Tool Time"" still airs on some cable television networks but having the entire series on DVD was worth the price.  Oh, and the Anniversary Collection comes in that red simulated metal ""tool box"" with a handle on top and a ""binford tape measure"" inside.  It's fun and probably a neat gift, but now where do I put the box?  If you don't want the box, you'll find the DVDs in other packaging.Added Note:  There is a terrific and much more detailed description of ""Home Improvement"" in Wikipedia.  It can be seen by searching on Tool Time in Google.Home Improvement: The 20th Anniversary Complete Collection",5,No Improvement Needed for Home Improvement,1348272000,"09 22, 2012",2012,2394,"['one', 'can', 'say', 'IMHO', 'Home', 'Improvement', 'was', 'comedy', 'classic', 'one', 'intelligent', 'story', 'line', 'whole', 'premise', 'show', 'ex-hardware', 'salesman', 'own', 'handy-man', 'show', 'ala', 'Bob', 'Vila', 'show', 'Tool', 'Time', 'become', 'most', 'inept', 'accident', 'prone', 'unhandy', 'man', 'anyone', 'could', 'ever', 'imagine', 'cable', 'television.On', 'Tool', 'Time', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'character', 'out', 'advice', 'projects', 'installing', 'shelf', 'wall', 'outlet', 'creating', 'entire', 'man', 'bathroom', 'complete', 'built-in', 'television', 'beer', 'cooler', 'Tim', 'usually', 'saved', 'near', 'disaster', 'own', 'making', 'basically', 'insecure', 'really', 'proficient', 'assistant', 'Al', 'Borland', 'old', 'fashioned', 'midwest', 'kind', 'guy', 'who', 'just', 'only', 'wear', 'flannel', 'shirts.The', 'other', 'part', 'program', 'mainly', 'place', 'Tim', 'home', 'suburban', 'Detroit', 'wife', 'Jill', 'three', 'extremely', 'active', 'sons', 'neighbor', 'Wilson', 'who', 'advice', 'coupled', 'philosophy', 'Taylors', 'wood', 'fence', 'dividing', 'back', 'yards', 'Tim', 'hot', 'rod', 'cars', 'HIS', 'garage', 'tries', 'add', 'more', 'power', 'home', 'appliances', 'loving', 'wife', 'tries', 'cope', 'keep', 'control', 'raising', 'three', 'sons', 'What', 'most', 'genuine', 'affection', 'Tim', 'Jill', 'set', 'little', 'big', 'situations', 'occur', 'average', 'family.The', 'show', 'ran', 'eight', 'years', 'watch', 'boys', 'grow', 'up', 'young', 'adulthood', 'Jill', 'out', 'free-lance', 'magazine', 'writer', 'then', 'back', 'college', 'earn', 'degree', 'professional', 'counsellor', 'finally', 'Tim', 'little', 'show', 'swallowed', 'up', 'corporate', 'bureaucratics', 'who', 'buy', 'out', 'tool', 'manufacturing', 'company', 'sponsored', 'Tool', 'Time', 'take', 'program', 'Tim', 'hands', 'Tool', 'Time', 'still', 'cable', 'television', 'networks', 'having', 'entire', 'series', 'DVD', 'was', 'worth', 'price', 'Oh', 'Anniversary', 'Collection', 'red', 'simulated', 'metal', 'tool', 'box', 'handle', 'top', 'binford', 'tape', 'measure', 'inside', 'fun', 'probably', 'neat', 'gift', 'now', 'where', 'do', 'put', 'box', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'box', ""'ll"", 'find', 'DVDs', 'other', 'packaging.Added', 'Note', 'terrific', 'much', 'more', 'detailed', 'description', 'Home', 'Improvement', 'Wikipedia', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'searching', 'Tool', 'Time', 'Google.Home', 'Improvement', '20th', 'Anniversary', 'Complete', 'Collection']",Home Improvement: The 20th Anniversary Complete Collection

Except to say that I kind of think of it as the last of the great family sitcoms.  As much as shows like ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" and ""King Of Queens"" were just getting started when this show left the air, neither of them, nor any other series since has ever been one that is truly geared toward entertainment for the whole family.  It was never really about the kids in ""Raymond"", and there were almost none at all in ""Queens"".  Home Improvement was the show of choice for our family here when my son was a youngin'.  I especially remember looking forward to the holiday episodes every year that pretty much stayed on the same theme, but hardly did we ever grow tired of them. They never missed a chance to create a very memorable and funny piece when Halloween, Thanksgiving, and especially Christmas came around every year.  They were the best always.  It's so unfortunate the kids on the show had to grow up, and, that TV itself just drifted away from family sitcoms that were always innocent, and just plain fun...As for this set itself, its the best.  The discs work perfectly, and the toolbox container is a nice nostalgic touch.  Probably best of all is the fact that as of the time of this writing this set is the best deal price wise on the entire series.  In fact I picked it up locally for more than what they are asking for it here.

I remember snuggling on the couch with my family & we would all laugh & enjoy the show together.The Show: All of the characters have great chemistry, they look their age & the Taylor&#8217;s even look like they could be related - how great is that! Shows on TV today aren&#8217;t like this, the actors are always 5-10 years older than their characters & overall it&#8217;s just not the same; I&#8217;m not saying everything is bad, there are some good ones, but overall it&#8217;s different.  Home Improvement is a great show for the entire family.The DVDs: It was so great watching these episodes again, especially as an adult, I still enjoy them so much & can watch them over & over. There were a few episodes I hadn&#8217;t seen before, so it was great to finally see all of them. The picture & sound quality is good, I have watched each episode & haven&#8217;t had any issues with any discs. The menu screen for selecting the episodes or playing them all is very straight forward & easy to use.The Collectors Toolbox: It&#8217;s cardboard, however, it&#8217;s durable. I think it&#8217;s the perfect casing for a collection such as this. If the box had been plastic it would&#8217;ve made it heavier & depending on where you box set is going, that could be a potential issue; in my opinion, the box is perfect. Each season fits perfectly into the cut out hole in the center of the box keeping each season safe & new looking. It comes with a little &#8220;Binford&#8221; level with a small pen, paper & measuring tape. Honestly, I wouldn&#8217;t actually use it for work around the house, but it&#8217;s a fun collectors item!Overall: I&#8217;m so glad that I bought this when I did, it seems like the price has gone way up, yikes! My order came early & in perfect condition. I&#8217;ve said this already but it truly is the perfect collection for any Home Improvement fan! The quality is great & so is the box set. I highly recommend this to people of all ages, it&#8217;s a great journey down memory lane, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll enjoy it as much the second time around as you did the first!",5,The Perfect Collection for All Home Improvement Fans!,1365724800,"04 12, 2013",2013,2221,"['day', 'still', 'absolutely', 'LOVE', 'Home', 'Improvement', 'far', 'one', 'most', 'favorite', 'TV', 'shows', 'watch', 'growing', 'up', 'remember', 'snuggling', 'couch', 'family', 'would', 'enjoy', 'show', 'Show', 'characters', 'have', 'great', 'chemistry', 'look', 'age', 'Taylor', '8217', 's', 'even', 'look', 'could', 'be', 'related', 'how', 'great', 'Shows', 'TV', 'today', 'aren', '8217', 'actors', 'are', 'always', '5-10', 'years', 'older', 'characters', 'overall', '8217', 's', 'just', 'not', 'same', '8217', 'not', 'saying', 'everything', 'bad', 'are', 'good', 'ones', '8217', 'different', 'Home', 'Improvement', 'great', 'show', 'entire', 'family.The', 'DVDs', 'was', 'so', 'great', 'watching', 'episodes', 'again', 'especially', 'adult', 'still', 'enjoy', 'so', 'much', 'can', 'watch', 'over', 'over', 'were', 'few', 'episodes', 'hadn', '8217', 'seen', 'was', 'great', 'finally', 'see', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'good', 'have', 'watched', 'episode', 'haven', '8217', 'had', 'issues', 'discs', 'menu', 'screen', 'selecting', 'episodes', 'playing', 'very', 'straight', 'forward', 'easy', 'use.The', 'Collectors', 'Toolbox', '8217', 'cardboard', 'however', '8217', 'durable', 'think', '8217', 's', 'perfect', 'casing', 'collection', 'such', 'box', 'had', 'been', 'plastic', 'would', '8217', 've', 'made', 'heavier', 'depending', 'where', 'box', 'set', 'going', 'could', 'be', 'potential', 'issue', 'opinion', 'box', 'perfect', 'season', 'perfectly', 'cut', 'out', 'hole', 'center', 'box', 'keeping', 'season', 'safe', 'new', 'looking', 'little', '8220', 'Binford', '8221', 'level', 'small', 'pen', 'paper', 'measuring', 'tape', 'Honestly', 'wouldn', '8217', 'actually', 'use', 'work', 'house', '8217', 's', 'fun', 'collectors', 'item', 'Overall', '8217', 'so', 'glad', 'bought', 'when', 'did', 'price', 'gone', 'way', 'up', 'yikes', 'order', 'came', 'early', 'perfect', 'condition', '8217', 've', 'said', 'already', 'truly', 'perfect', 'collection', 'Home', 'Improvement', 'fan', 'quality', 'great', 'so', 'box', 'set', 'highly', 'recommend', 'people', 'ages', '8217', 'great', 'journey', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', '8217', 'sure', '8217', 'enjoy', 'as', 'much', 'second', 'time', 'around', 'did', 'first']",Home Improvement: The 20th Anniversary Complete Collection
