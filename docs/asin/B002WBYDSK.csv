1296677,A25UZ7MA72SMKM,B002WBYDSK,Brent Butler,"[3, 3]","Alan Ludden created a simple but eminently entertaining show in Password, and the early years were the best. Guest stars included some of the most engaging comedians, actors, band leaders, and other personalities of the day. Although the games themselves were interesting, the real appeal was the interaction between the guest star players ... both with each other and with Alan, and occasionally with the players. You've never seen anyone as gracious as Alan Ludden. He met Betty White when she was a guest on the show and they later married.You'll find some wonderfully entertaining moments on this DVD. You might also watch for its occasional runs on the Game Show network. When they show it, it is generally in the wee morning hours, so use the search feature and then set your DVR to catch it. You'll be glad you did! In those runs you'll find such thrills as Jimmy Steward and wife Gloria (and their kids), Lucille Ball, Carol Burnette, Mitch Miller, Carol Channing, Peter Lawford (who held the long time record for the fastest lightning round), Skitch Henderson (you may not remember who Skitch was, but look him up ... he was also one of most engaging Password guest stars), Bennet Cerf, and the list goes on. This was a coveted guest role for major stars in those days. They enjoyed playing the game and were happy to do so on TV for us all to see. There are some moments to cherish in these shows.",5,Wonderful vintage game show,1315612800,"09 10, 2011",2011,1407,"['Alan', 'Ludden', 'created', 'simple', 'eminently', 'entertaining', 'show', 'Password', 'early', 'years', 'were', 'best', 'Guest', 'included', 'most', 'engaging', 'comedians', 'actors', 'band', 'leaders', 'other', 'personalities', 'day', 'games', 'were', 'interesting', 'real', 'appeal', 'was', 'interaction', 'guest', 'star', 'players', 'other', 'Alan', 'occasionally', 'players', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'anyone', 'as', 'gracious', 'Alan', 'Ludden', 'met', 'Betty', 'White', 'when', 'was', 'guest', 'show', 'later', 'married.You', ""'ll"", 'find', 'wonderfully', 'entertaining', 'moments', 'DVD', 'might', 'also', 'watch', 'occasional', 'runs', 'Game', 'Show', 'network', 'When', 'show', 'generally', 'wee', 'morning', 'hours', 'so', 'search', 'feature', 'then', 'set', 'DVR', 'catch', ""'ll"", 'be', 'glad', 'did', 'runs', ""'ll"", 'find', 'such', 'thrills', 'Jimmy', 'Steward', 'wife', 'Gloria', 'kids', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'Carol', 'Burnette', 'Mitch', 'Miller', 'Carol', 'Channing', 'Peter', 'Lawford', 'who', 'held', 'long', 'time', 'record', 'fastest', 'lightning', 'round', 'Skitch', 'Henderson', 'may', 'not', 'remember', 'who', 'Skitch', 'was', 'look', 'up', 'was', 'also', 'one', 'most', 'engaging', 'Password', 'guest', 'stars', 'Bennet', 'Cerf', 'list', 'was', 'coveted', 'guest', 'role', 'major', 'stars', 'days', 'enjoyed', 'playing', 'game', 'were', 'happy', 'do', 'so', 'TV', 'see', 'are', 'moments', 'cherish', 'shows']",N/A
1296678,AD5JI9UN98JPH,B002WBYDSK,christmas lover,"[1, 1]",This is a classic game show and has been done in various forms throughout the years like Password Plus Super Password and Million Dollar Password. All those are good and so is this which is the original Password. The only thing tough about it is that the clues had to be one word. I snached this up as I did DVDs of other game shows and its not a disappointment.
