458352,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,630529299X,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[7, 7]","I was very surprised by the level of humor, wit, charm, and simplicity surrounding the film I Think I Do.  I was expecting to see another low-budget independent film about homosexuality similar to what I witnessed in Go Fish, you know, the graininess of the scenes, the clich&eacute; homosexual characters coupled with humor that would be more political than funny, but I was wrong.  I must admit, I Think I Do was extremely stage-ish and not overly original, but what captured my attention throughout the film was the level of respect that the friends had for each other.  This was not a film that carried any hatred, or insecurities, or racism towards our main characters, but instead centered itself on the power of friends.  I think that is why I had such a big smile on my face as I watched this film.  Sure, on the surface it was about a gay man's struggle to decide between the man he has loved for many years or the long-term relationship he has already developed.  Yet, for me, there was so much more.  I would have to say that friendship was the central theme of this film, and director Brian Sloan realized this and used it to his advantage.  Instead creating this clich&eacute; pro-homosexuality film, Sloan just created a movie.  As you watch the characters develop, you forget that this is a gay film, but instead feels just like a typical modern romance that you would pay to see in theaters.  I hate to use the word average, but for I Think I Do, it is not a bad thing.  This was an average movie, and because of the average nature of the themes, characters, and emotions, I Think I Do is better than any romantic comedy that Hollywood could create.With independent films you sometimes run into the problem of having too many hands in the cookie jar.  By this I mean, too many characters and not having enough time to develop the emotions behind them all.  Brian Sloan overcame this typical hurdle and produced a film that gives each of our eight characters a chance to breathe and live on screen.  As I think back to this film, I do not know of one character that I could say I didn't know anything about.  It is rare in cinema, because so often directors focus most of the attention on their two centralized characters that the minor players fall to the wayside.  This is not the case in I Think I Do.  Everyone is developed, shockingly, and everyone is their own unique personality.  Sloan made sure that the eight different players didn't suddenly end up like each other.  With these types of films, especially in Go Fish, everyone was the same.  You had characters that were supposed to be different, but talked and walked exactly the same.  It is as if a gay man can only be played one way.  This film proves different.  I thought that the entire Sterling Scott backstory was hysterical.  Here you have this mediocre soap opera star that has this HUGE gay fan base.  For me, I found this so funny.  Each time he went out in public, he was swarmed by gay men wanting his autograph because they loved his ""hospital"" scenes that Bob had wrote.  Sterling was by far my favorite character because he could have been one to dapper the entire film, but instead he continued to keep it light and bubbly.  It was good to finally have ""fun"" characters, watching them have fun, and seeing this over-played story develop in a new way.  Again, I Think I Do was not original, but it was fun.The music in this film played a huge part in creating the tone of the film.  Instead of playing these clich&eacute; gay music, Sloan took contemporary tunes and placed them in the background.  These songs completely lightened the mood and created the essence of a comedy.  There weren't any dark, dreary moments to this film, you knew what was going to happen from the beginning, the only obstacle to overcome would be how Sloan was going to handle it.  I must admit, he did a great job.  Sloan's camera work isn't the greatest, his direction isn't as tight, but that isn't the reason for this film.  Love, friendship, and the classic tale of a missed college romance is the center of this film and Sloan keeps that in our face.  I have to applaud his dedication to these themes.  He didn't go political, he didn't try to make a huge statement about the gay community, he just made a movie.  This may be hard for me to explain, but I loved watching the ""standard"" wedding take place in the backdrop of this bigger romance.  I think Sloan placed our characters in the best positions for the best humor.  I just think I liked this film because it wasn't pushing pro-gay in my face, it was just demonstrating true love in our modern world.  I am surprised this film isn't shown more because of the unbiased images it shows.Again, I would like to restate that this was not a perfect film.  Was it a play prior to being captured on film?  While the answer may be ""no"", it did have a stage-like aura to it.  The actors seemed to pause after each of their jokes, and my only change would be to speed up the pacing of the humor.  It was funny, don't get me wrong, but the overall feeling of the film could have been tightened to create a perfect moment of gay cinema.  Finally, Sloan had the ability to build more into his story.  He made it so simple that more lines could have been crossed, and I secretly wished they would have.  I wanted to see more between Beth and Eric, and even more closure with Sarah, but I was satisfied.  This was a great film.  Funny, witty, charming ... you know, all those elements that seem to be missing whenever Hollywood taps its magic wand.  The story was unoriginal, but the themes will just grab at you and make you happy to live in a culture that will soon accept this type of lifestyle.Grade: **** out of *****",4,"If you can't fall in

The film makes me laugh and cry as much the 100th time as it did on my first viewing. If Brian Sloan can do this incredible a production on this lower-budgeted film, I can't wait to see what he can create when the ""bank vaults are open."" Mr. Sloan stated a very perceptive insight about the making of this film. If I can paraphrase a bit it is that gay and straight people cannot be seperated. They are intertwined together in our society.The film introduces us to a group of college friends (gay, straight, and closeted) during their senior year at Georgetown University and then jump-forwards five years later to their reunion at one of the couple's wedding. The plot is already described in many of the reviews on line already. Suffice to say the interwoven themes are about unrequited love, friendship, loyalty, honestly, and finding one's self-idenity and place in the word. The casting- PERFECT!- from the six main characters to all the supporting actors and actresses in this movie. The chemistry created by this ensemble is rarely matched or equaled in films today.My two favorite characters in the film? Carol and Brendan. Carol, the bride, gets all the good lines! Her facial and body language in her delivery only adds to my enjoyment and laughter. Brendan delivers one of the consistent and enjoyable roles from making me laugh to making me cry. The final scene with Brendan (and Bob) at the train station has me in tears everytime. Bravo Christian and Lauren!The script is border-line genius in so many of the lines- serious and funny. To top it all off is having the Partridge Family songs, which at times almost seem like they were made for this movie, pop in and out during the film.This film is why we all go to the movies... to laugh, have fun, and maybe walk away a better person having taken away a lesson(s) about life philosophies.

458364,AL1WBEKIEPUPE,630529299X,"GEORGE RANNIE ""GWRJWMCL""","[50, 52]","In the following review, I'm not going to tell the plot of this wonderful, warm movie because almost everyone else on this board has told highlights of the plot.  However I'm going to tell you what this fillm means to me on a personal level.This is one of my all time favorite movies.  It is a movie I view when I'm happy, when I'm sad, when I'm depressed, when I'm discontented,, when I'm contented when I'm grumpy, when I'm feeling older than god, etc.--in other words, no matter what state of mind I'm in, this movie makes me feel better, happier and yes, even younger. (By the way, I'm a whole lot older than the characters in the movie.) I really can't say how many time I've viewed ""I Think I Do"" it must be, going on, at least, a hundred times.  I love all of the characters.  It's just an integral part of my life.  In the course of a day, I'm forever thinking of some line from the film that I particularly like and find amusing (e.g., ""Advil and sleep"" ""Oh Bob, I'm scared, you've been writing for that soap-opera too long"" ""So making out in the bathroom is what you call romantic? It would've been if you hadn't been moving around so much"" ""your ex-father will arrive at..."" ""Whatever you say, pokey-bear"" etc. You'll have to see the movie to be able to relate and find out what context those quotes are in, and I'm sure you'll find your own funny lines to remember.I highly recommend this movie to anyone that wants a little romance, warmth and/or fantasy in his/her life (or just to feel good) by getting acquainted with a lovable group of wonderful friends where gay and straight get along and care about each other no matter what his/her respective sexual orientation happens to be.  To me the group of characters in ""I Think I Do"" are every bit as funny (if not funnier) as the characters on the television sit-com ""Friends""; however, the characters in the film are far more diverse--ethnically and sexually.  One thing for sure, they handle the gay issue far better than the television group does.  No one is ""put-down"" for being gay or appearing to be gay--no cheap shots at gay people.Each actor is wonderful in his or her role being far funnier and likeable than any of the actors in the above-mentioned sit-com.  The stand-out is Guilermo Diaz (he also starred in ""Stonewall"") as Eric.  The actress that plays Beth is also one of my favorites.  Frankly, I like them all!! I just wish, in my youth, I had a group of friends like those portrayed in this movie.  Maybe I'm reliving my youth a little (or at least a fantasy thereof), by repeated viewings of this film.The critics felt this movie was a 1990's version of a 1930's slapstick romantic comedy where ""boy gets girl""; however, in this movie ""boy gets boy"".  The gay romance is interwoven seamlessly into the fabric of the film occurring at the same time as a heterosexual wedding.

Recently I saw its trailer with another movie and wanted to see it, having completely forgotten in the intervening months that I'd seen it before. This time I LOVED it! Go figure. I guess it proves that sometimes first impressions are wrong.The story could be clich&eacute;d and predictable but isn't (I really love the satisfying and perfectly executed double-twist at the end); the characters could be tired stereotypes but aren't; the dialog could be as dumb as it is in most movies, but it is fresh, smart and completely believable; the ""my straight crush turns out to be gay and loves me"" fantasy could be infuriating (why I hated it before) but isn't, really, after all.Alexis Arquette is charming in the lead, Chris Maelen is every bit as marvelous as everybody else says he is, and the chemistry between them is real. (I've given up wondering why gorgeous, fantastic actors like Maelen don't go on to stardom, but he's probably better off. Arquette looks better and is obviously happier as a woman, but I'm very glad he made this and Grief - his two best performances - while he could still play male characters.)This movie's only faults are five extremely irritating minor characters: a priest, a stoner dude named Eric, and Carol's neurotic mother, slutty sister and ditzy aunt.

Alexis Arquette, as Bob, isn't even believable as the object of affection of Christian Maelin (as Brendan) and T.C. Watkins (as Sterling). It's a quantum leap for me to believe that Brendan or Sterling would ever be hung-up on Bob. And as an actor/actress, Arquette over-acts and doesn't have a natural acting prowess like Maelin or Watkins. We already knew that T.C. Watkins can act. The true relevation is the acting ability of Christian Maelin as Brendan. He's extremely good. But even Maelin and Watkins can't save a story/script that is dreadfully slow and boring. The whole movie seemed like a long party scene with not much happening. I was bored.",2,Overall movie is not good but Christian Maelin is a revelation!,1353196800,"11 18, 2012",2012,975,"['Think', 'Do', 'fairly', 'awful', 'wonder', 'authenticity', 'online', 'reviews', 'biggest', 'problem', 'casting', 'First', 'could', 'never', 'imagine', 'straight', 'couple', 'ever', 'getting', 'married', 'onscreen', 'chemistry', 'whatsoever', 'same', 'could', 'be', 'said', '3', 'leads', 'gay', 'triangle', 'chemistry', 'Alexis', 'Arquette', 'Bob', ""n't"", 'even', 'believable', 'object', 'affection', 'Christian', 'Maelin', 'Brendan', 'T.C', 'Watkins', 'Sterling', 'quantum', 'leap', 'believe', 'Brendan', 'Sterling', 'would', 'ever', 'be', 'hung-up', 'Bob', 'actor/actress', 'Arquette', 'over-acts', ""n't"", 'have', 'natural', 'acting', 'prowess', 'Maelin', 'Watkins', 'already', 'knew', 'T.C', 'Watkins', 'can', 'act', 'true', 'relevation', 'acting', 'ability', 'Christian', 'Maelin', 'Brendan', 'extremely', 'good', 'even', 'Maelin', 'Watkins', 'ca', ""n't"", 'save', 'story/script', 'dreadfully', 'slow', 'boring', 'whole', 'movie', 'seemed', 'long', 'party', 'scene', 'not', 'much', 'happening', 'was', 'bored']",I Think I Do VHS

458389,A26MQ4YGVS5CC2,630529299X,Todd Bartholomew,"[3, 3]","""I Think I Do"" is very much an ""of the moment"" movie that sums up the zeitgeist of the 1990s for the LGBT community.  The story starts in the 1980s as we get the familiar tale of two college buddies (Alexis Arquette and Christian Maelen) who are roommates and who quite subtly have the hots for each other.  While clearly shot on the cheap in Washington D.C. the film has an other-worldly real/unreal feel to it.  The script and the actors have the requisite ""independent"" feel that alternately feels excessive and languid, which hinders things a bit.  We don't really learn the characters names or motivations until we reach the flashback stage; before then they're just not fully fleshed out or articulated.  We only know that Bob wants Brendan, but his affections are unrequited.Flash forward six years and it's the marriage of Carol and Matt (Carol played by the delightful Lauren V&eacute;lez, better known as Lt. LaGuerta on the series ""Dexter"") and the old gang is invited to attend.  All have moved on with their lives and it's in the portion where ""I Think I Do"" finally hits its stride.  And while most have moved on with their lives not everyone has, culminating in Bob being torn between his involvement with his soap actor boyfriend Sterling and his unrequited love Brendan.  The film resolves itself in ways predictable and unexpected, lending a ""seen-it-all-before"" quality to the proceedings.  That's not to say it's a clich&eacute;d or trite movie, but it's hardly breaking new ground here.  I enjoyed it and there are far worse movies out there to see.

Several years later he's in an almost too comfortable relationship with the hunky soap opera star he writes for when he's reunited with Brendan at a wedding.  In the intervening years -  Brendan has realized he's gay and in love with Bob.  But he isn't sure about how to tell Bob about his feelings or what to do about the soap opera boyfriend, Sterling.  Add  the drama and comedy of old friends reuniting and the who do I really love and you have a wonderful and funny little film.The writing is crisp and sharp and direction is well done too.  The music is fantastic and centers around the classic sappy pop tunes of the Partridge Family (that we all love but almost no one admits to).
