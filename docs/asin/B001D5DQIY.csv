But why couldn't they have made it about Marlowe without bringing in the idea that he wrote Shakespeare?  It's a very improbable idea-- that Marlowe evaded or survived his documented murder, fled to the continent, and spent the next two decades writing the Shakespeare canon and somehow getting it performed and published in England.  And if PBS can produce a lavish program on Marlowe's candidacy, why can't it produce one on the much more substantial case that Edward de Vere wrote the Shakespeare canon?  It is entertaining to watch ""Marlovians"" baiting Stratfordians, but it is irrelevant to the real controversy.",4,An Entertaining  Irrelevance,1365206400,"04 6, 2013",2013,761,"['Christopher', 'Marlowe', 'was', 'most', 'important', 'Elizabethan', 'playwright', 'Shakespeare', 'lively', 'PBS', 'program', 'great', 'viewing', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'made', 'Marlowe', 'bringing', 'idea', 'wrote', 'Shakespeare', 'very', 'improbable', 'idea', 'Marlowe', 'evaded', 'survived', 'documented', 'murder', 'fled', 'continent', 'spent', 'next', 'two', 'decades', 'writing', 'Shakespeare', 'canon', 'somehow', 'getting', 'performed', 'published', 'England', 'PBS', 'can', 'produce', 'lavish', 'program', 'Marlowe', 'candidacy', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'produce', 'one', 'much', 'more', 'substantial', 'case', 'Edward', 'Vere', 'wrote', 'Shakespeare', 'canon', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'Marlovians', 'baiting', 'Stratfordians', 'irrelevant', 'real', 'controversy']",Frontline: Much Ado About Something
1179352,A3MWYPZBKL1NJ,B001D5DQIY,Jeffery Mingo,"[1, 8]","Did Marlowe fake his death and send Shakespeare his plays from Italy?  This work wrestles with that question for 90 minutes.  The work said not just Marlowe, but DeVere, a third author, may have penned Shakespearen works.  However, they never pursue that avenue in the slightest.The problem is that it doesn't pose that question upfront and then answer it.  It meanders and you could miss things if you don't listen carefully.  How did Shakespeare write high-level work when he never attended college?  If his female characters could read, then why didn't he teach his daughters to read?  If Shakespeare had to perform a lot of managing at the Globe, how did he have so much time to write?Why are so many Shakespeare plays set in Italy?  Why do Shakespeare's sonnets often deal with exile when that never happened to the bard?  This documentary raises many intriguing questions, but it's slow-moving.  This could not be played in an American high school because teenagers would not stay focused upon it.  The work hints that Queen Elizabeth could have played a role in Marlowe's cover-up.  Why not start off with something attention-grabbing like that?This work has a class politic and a gender politic.  Extant signatures of Shakespeare are chicken scratch, so how could he write entire, legible plays?  Marlowe went to college, how did Shakespeare develop high-level skills?  This work interviews women as well as men.  One interviewee said Marlowe didn't write much with women, but Shakespeare has many powerful female characters.One interviewee contrasts Marlowe's rainbow flag nature with Shakespeare's marriage to a woman at age 18.  However, no one ever talks about theories that Shakespeare too may have had things in common with Oscar Wilde and E.M. Forster.When hearing authors and scholars debate this matter, I got it.  However, this work posits that everyday folk are invested in the question.  I don't know about putting that much energy into a 400 year-old concern.  Go buy stock or get physically fit or something that could improve you directly!One interviewee had the most annoying voice.  I barely wanted to hear him.  The work interviews an Italian archivist, but it doesn't let you know she's speaking French to the camera, rather than Italian.I wish this work could have tied the question to theories of others that are not supposedly dead.  Examples include Elvis, Tupac, Anastasia, and others.  I wish the work asked, ""Why can't fans accept that certain famous people died when reports says so?""",4,Shakespeare vs. Marlowe,1225238400,"10 29, 2008",2008,2519,"['Did', 'Marlowe', 'fake', 'death', 'send', 'Shakespeare', 'plays', 'Italy', 'work', 'question', '90', 'minutes', 'work', 'said', 'not', 'just', 'Marlowe', 'DeVere', 'third', 'author', 'may', 'have', 'penned', 'Shakespearen', 'works', 'However', 'never', 'pursue', 'avenue', 'slightest.The', 'problem', ""n't"", 'pose', 'question', 'upfront', 'then', 'answer', 'could', 'miss', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'listen', 'carefully', 'How', 'did', 'Shakespeare', 'write', 'high-level', 'work', 'when', 'never', 'attended', 'college', 'female', 'characters', 'could', 'read', 'then', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'teach', 'daughters', 'read', 'Shakespeare', 'had', 'perform', 'lot', 'managing', 'Globe', 'how', 'did', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'write', 'Why', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'Shakespeare', 'plays', 'set', 'Italy', 'Why', 'do', 'Shakespeare', 'sonnets', 'often', 'deal', 'exile', 'when', 'never', 'happened', 'bard', 'documentary', 'many', 'intriguing', 'questions', 'slow-moving', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'played', 'American', 'high', 'school', 'teenagers', 'would', 'not', 'stay', 'focused', 'work', 'hints', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'role', 'Marlowe', 'cover-up', 'Why', 'not', 'start', 'off', 'something', 'attention-grabbing', 'work', 'class', 'politic', 'gender', 'politic', 'Extant', 'signatures', 'Shakespeare', 'are', 'chicken', 'scratch', 'how', 'could', 'write', 'entire', 'legible', 'plays', 'Marlowe', 'went', 'college', 'how', 'did', 'Shakespeare', 'develop', 'high-level', 'skills', 'work', 'women', 'as', 'well', 'men', 'One', 'interviewee', 'said', 'Marlowe', 'did', ""n't"", 'write', 'much', 'women', 'Shakespeare', 'many', 'powerful', 'female', 'characters.One', 'interviewee', 'Marlowe', 'rainbow', 'flag', 'nature', 'Shakespeare', 'marriage', 'woman', 'age', '18', 'However', 'one', 'ever', 'theories', 'Shakespeare', 'too', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'things', 'common', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'E.M.', 'Forster.When', 'hearing', 'authors', 'scholars', 'debate', 'matter', 'got', 'However', 'work', 'everyday', 'folk', 'are', 'invested', 'question', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'putting', 'much', 'energy', '400', 'year-old', 'concern', 'Go', 'buy', 'stock', 'get', 'physically', 'fit', 'something', 'could', 'improve', 'directly', 'One', 'interviewee', 'had', 'most', 'annoying', 'voice', 'barely', 'wanted', 'hear', 'work', 'Italian', 'archivist', ""n't"", 'let', 'know', 'speaking', 'French', 'camera', 'rather', 'Italian.I', 'wish', 'work', 'could', 'have', 'tied', 'question', 'theories', 'others', 'are', 'not', 'supposedly', 'dead', 'Examples', 'include', 'Elvis', 'Tupac', 'Anastasia', 'others', 'wish', 'work', 'asked', 'Why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fans', 'accept', 'certain', 'famous', 'people', 'died', 'when', 'reports', 'so']",Frontline: Much Ado About Something
1179353,A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ,B001D5DQIY,"L. Power ""nlp trainer""","[13, 13]","I decided to watch this several months ago because of my increasing interest in Marlowe.I first read Dr Faustus immediately after reading Hamlet, and was immediately struck by the curious parallels between the opening soliloquy of Faust, and Hamlet's famous meditation on life and death.Faust philosophises about life and death,..'and live and die in Aristotle's works'..'bid On Kai me On farewell (bid being and non being farewell)..Que Sera Sera.. what will be, will be.If you're like me, the more you read Marlowe, the more parallels you find between him and the Shakespeare canon.  Marlowe is credited with revolutionising and popularising the use of blank verse (unrhymed) on the Elizabethan stage, a style repeated throughout Shakespeare.Unfortunately, with serious Atheism charges pending against Marlowe, (who also was a spy), he was supposedly killed in a tavern knife fight in May 1593. Two of the three people at the scene were spies, the third, the accused killer Frizer (who stabbed Marlowe through the eye is self defense), an employee of his patron Walsingham, a cousin of the former head of Intelligence, Francis Walsingham.Frizer was pardoned, and continued to work for the patron for many years.Twelve days before Marlowe died Venus and Adonis was registered anonymously with the Stationer's Office.Twelve days after, with the printing of Venus and Adonis, Shakespeare's name appears in print as a published writer for the first time.The documentary itself, is very balanced, with contributions from Marlovian Scholars such as Dolly Wraight, who has written several good books on the subject.  I particularly enjoyed the segments with Calvin Hoffman, who was probably the premier investigator of Marlowe within the Shakespeare canon.There is also a segment with Charles Nicholl, who wrote The Reckoning, another essential read.  I was particularly impressed with his research and use of primary sources, and his attention to detail.Their commentary is balanced by contributions by Stanley Wells, who has written numerous books about Shakespeare, and is the editor of the Oxford Shakespeare.The documentary is very well done, and I have now read Hoffman's Murder of the Man who was Shakespeare.  He uncovered numerous clues, such as the scorning of the uneducated William in the  woods of Arden, in As You Like et.  Why would Shakespeare create a character named William whom he would then attack for his lack of learning in a play?  A reversal of the name Sir Oliver Mar-Text yields  Is Marlos veri text.  This play registered in 1600 was stayed from publication, making its first appearance in the First Folio of 1623.Whatever your interest in Marlowe is, at some point this is a must see.  Even if you believe that Shakespeare wrote Shakespeare, it's interesting to see two actors quoting exact lines that appear in both Shakespeare and Marlowe plays, to see how profoundly one influenced the other.I also recommendThe Life & Complete Works Of Christopher Marloweas an inexpensive yet factually comprehensive way to jump into Marlowe's world.  If you're like me, it's a rich rewarding experience.I think you will enjoy it, and I hope this was helpful.",5,As you Like -it,1334620800,"04 17, 2012",2012,3171,"['decided', 'watch', 'several', 'months', 'ago', 'increasing', 'interest', 'Marlowe.I', 'first', 'read', 'Dr', 'Faustus', 'immediately', 'reading', 'Hamlet', 'was', 'immediately', 'struck', 'curious', 'parallels', 'opening', 'soliloquy', 'Faust', 'Hamlet', 'famous', 'meditation', 'life', 'death.Faust', 'philosophises', 'life', 'death', ""..'and"", 'live', 'die', 'Aristotle', ""works'..'bid"", 'Kai', 'farewell', 'bid', 'being', 'non', 'being', 'farewell', '..Que', 'Sera', 'Sera..', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'will', 'be.If', ""'re"", 'more', 'read', 'Marlowe', 'more', 'parallels', 'find', 'Shakespeare', 'canon', 'Marlowe', 'credited', 'revolutionising', 'popularising', 'use', 'blank', 'verse', 'unrhymed', 'Elizabethan', 'stage', 'style', 'repeated', 'Shakespeare.Unfortunately', 'serious', 'Atheism', 'pending', 'Marlowe', 'who', 'also', 'was', 'spy', 'was', 'supposedly', 'killed', 'tavern', 'knife', 'fight', 'May', '1593', 'Two', 'three', 'people', 'scene', 'were', 'spies', 'third', 'accused', 'killer', 'Frizer', 'who', 'stabbed', 'Marlowe', 'eye', 'self', 'defense', 'employee', 'patron', 'Walsingham', 'cousin', 'former', 'head', 'Intelligence', 'Francis', 'Walsingham.Frizer', 'was', 'pardoned', 'continued', 'work', 'patron', 'many', 'years.Twelve', 'days', 'Marlowe', 'died', 'Venus', 'Adonis', 'was', 'registered', 'anonymously', 'Stationer', 'Office.Twelve', 'days', 'printing', 'Venus', 'Adonis', 'Shakespeare', 'name', 'print', 'published', 'writer', 'first', 'time.The', 'documentary', 'very', 'balanced', 'contributions', 'Marlovian', 'Scholars', 'such', 'Dolly', 'Wraight', 'who', 'written', 'several', 'good', 'books', 'subject', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'segments', 'Calvin', 'Hoffman', 'who', 'was', 'probably', 'premier', 'investigator', 'Marlowe', 'Shakespeare', 'canon.There', 'also', 'segment', 'Charles', 'Nicholl', 'who', 'wrote', 'Reckoning', 'essential', 'read', 'was', 'particularly', 'impressed', 'research', 'use', 'primary', 'sources', 'attention', 'detail.Their', 'commentary', 'balanced', 'contributions', 'Stanley', 'Wells', 'who', 'written', 'numerous', 'books', 'Shakespeare', 'editor', 'Oxford', 'Shakespeare.The', 'documentary', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'have', 'now', 'read', 'Hoffman', 'Murder', 'Man', 'who', 'was', 'Shakespeare', 'uncovered', 'numerous', 'clues', 'such', 'scorning', 'uneducated', 'William', 'woods', 'Arden', 'et', 'Why', 'would', 'Shakespeare', 'create', 'character', 'named', 'William', 'whom', 'would', 'then', 'attack', 'lack', 'learning', 'play', 'reversal', 'name', 'Sir', 'Oliver', 'Mar-Text', 'yields', 'Marlos', 'veri', 'text', 'play', 'registered', '1600', 'was', 'stayed', 'publication', 'making', 'first', 'appearance', 'First', 'Folio', '1623.Whatever', 'interest', 'Marlowe', 'point', 'must', 'see', 'Even', 'believe', 'Shakespeare', 'wrote', 'Shakespeare', 'interesting', 'see', 'two', 'actors', 'quoting', 'exact', 'lines', 'appear', 'Shakespeare', 'Marlowe', 'plays', 'see', 'how', 'profoundly', 'one', 'influenced', 'other.I', 'also', 'Life', 'Complete', 'Works', 'Christopher', 'Marloweas', 'inexpensive', 'yet', 'factually', 'comprehensive', 'way', 'jump', 'Marlowe', 'world', ""'re"", 'rich', 'rewarding', 'experience.I', 'think', 'will', 'enjoy', 'hope', 'was', 'helpful']",Frontline: Much Ado About Something

Unconvincing in arguing that Marlowe wrote the plays attributed to Shakespeare.I used to make an annual pilgrimage to the Oregon Shakespeare Festival where I would attend seven plays in five days.  I have always heard people comment about Shakespeare's wonderful use of language.  Because of my dyslexia, I tend to be 'tone deaf' to many of the subtleties of language (both spoken and written), but I always enjoyed the plots and the interesting characters, especially as they were brought to life by the wonderful actors in Ashland, Oregon.One year the festival presented one of Marlowe's most popular plays.  In spite of the excellent staging and fine acting, the play didn't particularly grab me.  The next night I saw Shakespeare's 'Richard III' and, for the first time in my life, I finally heard how Shakespeare's language indeed did soar (in stark contrast to the Marlowe play that I had seen the night before).  I could never believe that the person that wrote that Marlowe play could possibly be the author of 'Richard III.'I wish that the Frontline program 'The Shakespeare Mystery,' which presents a very convincing case for Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, were also available on DVD.
