The documentary itself is only 48 min., so I'm not sure why they cut out scenes such as the analysis of ""Drain You""; a section about Grohl's joining of the band (it's tough to overstate the importance of that addition to the band); a funny anecdote about the band's stymied attempt to travel from Seattle to L.A. to begin pre-production; and a look at the cover art that actually talks to the baby on the album cover -- now a likable and very hip-looking teenager.This installment in the series is one of the better ones.",4,"Hello, hello, hello, how low...?",1131753600,"11 12, 2005",2005,993,"['solidly-made', 'thoroughly', 'interesting', 'entry', 'Classic', 'Album', 'series', 'time', 'focusing', 'Nirvana', 'landmark', 'album', 'Nevermind', 'doc', 'tracks', 'in-depth', 'analysis', 'also', 'talks', 'Grohl', 'Novoselic', 'Butch', 'Vig', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'say', 'piece', 'love', 'Nirvana', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'find', 'completely', 'absorbing.And', 'check', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'too', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'important', 'stuff', 'was', 'there', 'documentary', 'only', '48', 'min.', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'cut', 'out', 'scenes', 'such', 'analysis', 'Drain', 'section', 'Grohl', 'joining', 'band', 'tough', 'overstate', 'importance', 'addition', 'band', 'funny', 'anecdote', 'band', 'stymied', 'attempt', 'travel', 'Seattle', 'L.A.', 'begin', 'pre-production', 'look', 'cover', 'art', 'actually', 'baby', 'album', 'cover', 'now', 'likable', 'very', 'hip-looking', 'teenager.This', 'installment', 'series', 'one', 'better', 'ones']",Classic Albums - Nirvana: Nevermind
884979,AEUIDDK5MU1LI,B0007OP1HG,Dennis W. Alvey,"[5, 7]","This was a pretty pleasant surprise. Recent interviews with Kris and Dave, writers, journalists and producers with thier input on the making and influence of this record. Perfect DVD to sit and geek out on and absorb usesless knowledge. I have to admit, the bits with Butch Vig get a bit tedious. At times i'm thinkin' he's sorta milking it or just giving already obvious insight... and those glasses. haha... they dont make you look any cooler. get rid of the mustache, dude. Anyhow, the best parts are the interviews and extras with Kris and Dave. Also what's really admirable is the maintenance of the topic. There's no crying or drama about Kurt's death or drug problems, AND NO COURTNEY LOVE!! WHHOOHOOO! Although, some insight from Dave and Kris' point of view on the topic of Kurt's death totally intrigue me, that would have put a damper on the DVD. There's some really cool live footage from their beginnings and some well done video graphic art work. geeky stuff not alot of people might care about but it adds to the quality and enjoyment of the DVD. There are some live clips (kris with shaved head...yikes) and a full live version of Polly on the extras. Also the baby on the cover of the record is now 14 years old and get his 15 minutes (well, more like 3) of fame.  dude, its cheap and its really enjoyable. buy it.",4,better than i suspected,1113436800,"04 14, 2005",2005,1331,"['was', 'pretty', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'Recent', 'interviews', 'Kris', 'Dave', 'writers', 'journalists', 'producers', 'thier', 'input', 'making', 'influence', 'record', 'Perfect', 'DVD', 'sit', 'geek', 'out', 'absorb', 'usesless', 'knowledge', 'have', 'admit', 'bits', 'Butch', 'Vig', 'get', 'bit', 'tedious', 'times', 'i', ""'m"", 'thinkin', 'sorta', 'milking', 'just', 'giving', 'already', 'obvious', 'insight', 'glasses', 'haha', 'dont', 'make', 'look', 'cooler', 'get', 'rid', 'mustache', 'dude', 'Anyhow', 'best', 'parts', 'are', 'interviews', 'extras', 'Kris', 'Dave', 'Also', 'what', 'really', 'admirable', 'maintenance', 'topic', 'crying', 'drama', 'Kurt', 'death', 'drug', 'problems', 'NO', 'COURTNEY', 'LOVE', 'WHHOOHOOO', 'insight', 'Dave', 'Kris', 'point', 'view', 'topic', 'Kurt', 'death', 'totally', 'intrigue', 'would', 'have', 'put', 'damper', 'DVD', 'really', 'cool', 'live', 'footage', 'beginnings', 'well', 'done', 'video', 'graphic', 'art', 'work', 'geeky', 'stuff', 'not', 'alot', 'people', 'might', 'care', 'quality', 'enjoyment', 'DVD', 'are', 'live', 'clips', 'kris', 'shaved', 'head', 'yikes', 'full', 'live', 'version', 'Polly', 'extras', 'Also', 'baby', 'cover', 'record', 'now', '14', 'years', 'old', 'get', '15', 'minutes', 'well', 'more', '3', 'fame', 'dude', 'cheap', 'really', 'enjoyable', 'buy']",Classic Albums - Nirvana: Nevermind

884982,AV6J6ET05AYEM,B0007OP1HG,lucifer_sam,"[3, 3]","i'm glad ""nevermind"" finally got a spot in the ""classic albums"" series.  it's probably best to leave the story of a controversial and famous record like ""nevermind"" to a reputable name who actually have a budget and can get butch vig, krist novoselic, dave grohl, and thurston moore to appear in their dvds rather than a bunch of burnouts and junkies who maybe knew kurt in middle school.  if you're interested in music engineering as i am, watching butch vig shave tracks off songs such as ""in bloom"" and ""drain you"" to reveal the individual vocal, guitar, and bass tracks naked is highly intriguing.  the comments from dave and krist are interesting as usual as is the appearence of thurston moore from sonic youth, one of my other favorite bands.one small complaint is that the flow of the footage seems kind of disorienting and vague at times, as one minute krist would be talking about how he and kurt smashed their gear to get off stage and close their set while the next minute butch vig will be telling a little anecdote about how he couldn't get kurt to double track vocals.  this actually detracts from the overall value very little, however.one other thing i missed in this release is the fact that the engineering aspects of songs such as ""lounge act"", ""breed"", ""territorial pissings"" (interesting in the sense that kurt plugged his guitar straight into the board), ""on a plain"", or ""stay away"" aren't to be found on this release.  clips of most of these songs can be found on the release but there isn't much in-depth information about them.  this is unfortunate, but this DVD dodges the bullet again and it doesn't ruin the experience.  as an aside, the june 2005 issue of guitar world contains two long, excellent articles about the making of ""bleach"" and ""nevermind"" that complement the information on this DVD very well.  the ""nevermind"" article is of interest because it does actually cover all of the songs on the album as well as the other songs that were recorded during the sessions but never used, such as ""sappy"" and ""old age"".the exterior packaging is done very well too, keeping in with the watery theme of the cover art on ""nevermind"".  as such, i kind of expected a bunch of morons to buy it and expect it to be a compilation of music videos or something and get all pissed off when it's just some lame-o documentary with a bunch of stupid-head old dudes playing around in a studio.  try reading the packaging before you buy something, idiots.  and there actually is one full-length video in this release: a really good live version of ""polly"" with an ethereal, watery backdrop being projected on the curtain behind the band.  of course, i doubt this would please the ""smells like teen spirit"" teenie-boppers but i liked it.  the bonus material is very good as well and includes an interview with the now grown-up baby pictured on the cover of the album, who has now become a stuttering sub-mongoloid who looks like he was loaded into a cannon and fired into a wall at pacsun.  just like the kind of people who would buy a DVD about the making of ""nevermind"" and expect it to be a music video compilation.",4,a few holes but is better than most nirvana documentaries,1115424000,"05 7, 2005",2005,3133,"['i', ""'m"", 'glad', 'nevermind', 'finally', 'got',

I didn't want to get disappointed, and I didn't. This is the making of Nevermind. With no real footage from the sessions though, the band members, producers, etc tell the story. The thing was there are really not any interviews of Kurt. I am pretty sure he has said something about the album or the sessions in the past. The extra features include a live performance of ""Polly"", which if you have the box set the performance of ""Jesus Doesn't Want Me for a Sunbeam"" it is the same concert. Also the making of the smells like teen spirit. Again there is no footage of the shoot just director Sam Bayer discussing the shoot. Also the band talks about how Dave joined the band. The making of ""Drain You"" is just the producer messing around with the soundboard and discussing the session. Then the band and everyone else just discuss how they got the idea for the album cover. They even interview Spencer Elden who is the baby featured on the Nevermind Cover. If you're a big Nirvana fan this is for you.

884985,A5R3U8ZSFKAL4,B0007OP1HG,"Paul Lawrence ""'EJL'""","[2, 2]","Without Cobain to interview afresh for this release the producers have had to cobble together old interview footage. And this is part of the tragedy of the situation because I for one would love to be able to hear what a grown up and more mature Cobain would of said about the album he is most famous for. Others may champion earlier stuff like Bleach but it's Nevermind that for the average punter is this band, and in fact the entire grunge movements calling card.That's not to say that Cobain doesn't get to speak, as noted earlier there is a chunk of interview footage with him. And Novoselic and Grohl do a great job in giving thoughtful and considered insights into the process and mind set of the band. The are less amusing anecdotes here than are shared by some of the other bands featured in this series perhaps because of the rather sombre tone the tragic end of the tale culminates in. But there are a slew of interesting points to be found out about the bands genesis and their progression through the trials and tribulations of the underground scene to their explosion with this album, spearheaded by the hard rock anthem Smells Like Teen Spirit.As per usual with the Classic Albums series some of the most interesting aspects of this release are provided by the associates of the band - management and producer types and some of the real talent behind the band is explained. Which for me as only a casual fan was really enlightening and some of my preconceptions were challenged. Which is a great thing to have happen sometimes.Through my reviews of various products, pretty much all the Classic Albums series I've written about have scored four stars. They aren't life changing - hey I'd rather play an album than watch a show about it most of the time - but they are great for fans, even casual ones. This one deserves four stars but only just, as there is that overall feeling of loss, of the part of the jig saw puzzle that should be in the middle has been lost forever. But the understated yet appropriate production values, interesting discussions and the bonus material which takes the running time out to 74 minutes mean this is well worth your while especially if you can pick it up cheap.Nirvana were always a flawed proposition. Feeding off the usual teenage feelings of alienation they were the right band at the right time. At a stage where teenage alienation had become a packaged parody of itself, offered up with bright lights and brighter profit margins to an ever more consumerist 15-24 year old market, Nirvana came along and scooped up millions of fans who were alienated from the pre-packaged alienation, if you take my meaning. They only held these fans in the palms of their hands for a couple of years but that was enough to secure their place in hard rock/heavy metal folklore. Because while some sections of their fanbase may be aghast at the idea, this is hard rock. This album did not convert people to liking loud music, this album sold to people who already did. And this DVD is a great exploration of some of the reasons they jumped so effectively into the fast lane of the mainstream and the creative process of how they formed the recorded statement for which they'll always be remembered.",4,"Kurt isn't here,  but he'll always be here...",1200614400,"01 18, 2008",2008,3236,"['Cobain', 'interview', 'afresh', 'release', 'producers', 'have', 'had', 'cobble', 'together', 'old', 'interview', 'footage', 'part', 'tragedy', 'situation', 'one', 'would', 'love', 'be', 'able', 'hear', 'what', 'grown', 'up', 'more', 'mature', 'Cobain', 'would', 'said', 'album', 'most', 'famous', 'Others', 'may', 'champion', 'earlier', 'stuff', 'Bleach', 'Nevermind', 'average', 'punter', 'band', 'fact', 'entire', 'grunge', 'movements', 'calling', 'card.That', 'not', 'say', 'Cobain', ""n't"", 'get', 'speak', 'noted', 'earlier', 'chunk', 'interview', 'footage', 'Novoselic', 'Grohl', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'giving', 'thoughtful', 'considered', 'insights', 'process', 'mind', 'set', 'band', 'are', 'less', 'amusing', 'anecdotes', 'here', 'are', 'shared', 'other', 'bands', 'featured', 'series', 'perhaps', 'rather', 'sombre', 'tone', 'tragic', 'end', 'tale', 'are', 'slew', 'interesting', 'points', 'be', 'found', 'bands', 'genesis', 'progression', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'underground', 'scene', 'explosion', 'album', 'spearheaded', 'hard', 'rock', 'anthem', 'Smells', 'Teen', 'Spirit.As', 'usual', 'Classic', 'Albums', 'series', 'most', 'interesting', 'aspects', 'release', 'are', 'provided', 'associates', 'band', 'management', 'producer', 'types', 'real', 'talent', 'band', 'explained', 'Which', 'only', 'casual', 'fan', 'was', 'really', 'enlightening', 'preconceptions', 'were', 'challenged', 'Which', 'great', 'thing', 'have', 'happen', 'reviews', 'various', 'products', 'pretty', 'much', 'Classic', 'Albums', 'series', ""'ve"", 'written', 'about', 'have', 'scored', 'four', 'stars', 'are', ""n't"", 'life', 'changing', 'hey', ""'d"", 'rather', 'play', 'album', 'watch', 'show', 'most', 'time', 'are', 'great', 'fans', 'even', 'casual', 'ones', 'one', 'four', 'stars', 'only', 'just', 'overall', 'feeling', 'loss', 'part', 'jig', 'saw', 'puzzle', 'should', 'be', 'middle', 'been', 'lost', 'forever', 'understated', 'yet', 'appropriate', 'production', 'values', 'interesting', 'discussions', 'bonus', 'material', 'running', 'time', '74', 'minutes', 'mean', 'well', 'worth', 'especially', 'can', 'pick', 'up', 'cheap.Nirvana', 'were', 'always', 'flawed', 'proposition', 'Feeding', 'off', 'usual', 'teenage', 'feelings', 'alienation', 'were', 'right', 'band', 'right', 'time', 'stage', 'where', 'teenage', 'alienation', 'had', 'become', 'packaged', 'parody', 'offered', 'up', 'bright', 'lights', 'brighter', 'profit', 'margins', 'ever', 'more', 'consumerist', '15-24', 'year', 'old', 'market', 'Nirvana', 'came', 'along', 'scooped', 'up', 'millions', 'fans', 'who', 'were', 'alienated', 'pre-packaged', 'alienation', 'take', 'meaning', 'only', 'held', 'fans', 'palms', 'hands', 'couple', 'years', 'was', 'enough', 'secure', 'place', 'hard', 'rock/heavy', 'metal', 'folklore', 'sections', 'fanbase', 'may', 'be', 'aghast', 'idea', 'hard', 'rock', 'album', 'did', 'not', 'convert', 'people', 'liking', 'loud', 'music', 'album', 'sold', 'people', 'who', 'already', 'did', 'DVD', 'great', 'exploration', 'reasons', 'jumped', 'so', 'effectively', 'fast', 'lane', 'mainstream', 'creative', 'process', 'how', 'formed', 'recorded', 'statement', ""'ll"", 'always', 'be', 'remembered']",Classic Albums - Nirvana: Nevermind

Being a Nirvana fan I picked this up new, sealed on here for like $4.00 and I will now look into the other additions to this series.Nevermind as a LP/CD has fantastic music, drove everyone nuts back in the day and opened the door for the Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam and Sound Garden types. ALL of which ADDED something the others did not have! What a great time to be 22 years old I now realise! Saw Nirvana live in 1993 and before that, I hardly knew their music but I researched and found a great backstory about them and was hooked. In Utero was my favorite album. If you enjoy Nirvana in the least pick this up. Great insight on how the album came to be, was recorded, how it was received and how it changed music at that time...literally overnight. I remember when they hit they made it big and FAST...was insane. I can't think of anyone recent that last did this...which is sad really. Current generations have no defining group that speaks for them..just the same old crap recycled. This era was a breath of fresh air. Like Dave Grohl says in it, he would be nothing if it wasn't for the other 2 members and music would not be the same without all 3 of them.Only complaint is that the sound format is Dolby 2.0, video is a decent 16X9 1.85 format and looks quite nice. Reissue this on Blu-ray with added footage, use a updated audio format and you are set.Highly recommended.",5,Nirvana fan?
