(and by that I mean literally sell all its titles to FUNimation where they might actually get some deserved treatment.  (Dubbing/better packaging).",1,FUNimation please buy this series off of Bandai!

1326638,AHO36V79YNS88,B0035KTIYQ,Lansing,"[3, 18]","Kannagi is one of my favorite series, but when they charge 50$ for a DVD box set to a ""13 episode"" series, and it isn't even dubbed, I call it criminal.Common Practice with Bandai, and Sentai Filmworks. They won't put series in 5.1, but instead 2.0. Over half the time they don't even dub. To top it all off, not only are their products not in 5.1 or dubbed, but they also charge PREMIUM prices for their Discs as well. 50-60$ it just unacceptable anymore for a DVD/Blu-Ray still in production.Basically they get a license, then they ship off the dvds.Sry for ranting, kannagi is a great anime series. It is cliche, but the way the series is presented compared to most animes of its genre is excellent.I do not recommend buying it, until they at least dub it. Hell I'd only buy it if they at least dropped the price to 20$ and dubbed it.",1,Great Series but 1 star for not being dubbed,1312243200,"08 2, 2011",2011,837,"['Kannagi', 'one', 'favorite', 'series', 'when', 'charge', '50', 'DVD', 'box', 'set', '13', 'episode', 'series', ""n't"", 'even', 'dubbed', 'call', 'criminal.Common', 'Practice', 'Bandai', 'Sentai', 'Filmworks', 'wo', ""n't"", 'put', 'series', '5.1', 'instead', '2.0', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'dub', 'top', 'off', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'products', 'not', '5.1', 'dubbed', 'also', 'charge', 'PREMIUM', 'prices', 'Discs', 'well', '50-60', 'just', 'unacceptable', 'anymore', 'DVD/Blu-Ray', 'still', 'production.Basically', 'get', 'license', 'then', 'ship', 'dvds.Sry', 'ranting', 'kannagi', 'great', 'anime', 'series', 'cliche', 'way', 'series', 'presented', 'compared', 'most', 'animes', 'genre', 'excellent.I', 'do', 'not', 'recommend', 'buying', 'least', 'dub', 'Hell', ""'d"", 'only', 'buy', 'least', 'dropped', 'price', '20', 'dubbed']",Kannagi: Crazy Shrine Maidens Complete Collection

1326640,A3DF8QZ9V8Q10N,B0035KTIYQ,"R. Lusk ""Robbie Lusk""","[2, 2]","Well there is a great story here in Kannagi. I found the characters and the animation design by A-1 Pictures to be very good.There are harem aspects in the show, but it's much more than that. It's about two young people, Jin and Kannagi, that come together under unusual circumstances. They learn to live with each others inconsistencies while trying to figure out just who the hell they are in the world.That statement is especially true for Kannagi or Nagi as she is called by Jin, and her friends. All the side or minor characters are good ,too.As you watch them spend time together, you do find yourself wanting to know more about them.It's just a damn enjoyable anime, and hilarious at times. It definately takes you on an emotional ride. Of course there may be a few things left to the unknown, but the overall charming story it does tell really does cover that up.It comes with Volumes 1 and 2, one disc per volume, in an open ended case that holds both.I highly recommend it.",5,Very Enjoyable Anime Series!,1298851200,"02 28, 2011",2011,983,"['Well', 'great', 'story', 'here', 'Kannagi', 'found', 'characters', 'animation', 'design', 'A-1', 'Pictures', 'be', 'very', 'good.There', 'are', 'harem', 'aspects', 'show', 'much', 'more', 'two', 'young', 'people', 'Jin', 'Kannagi', 'come', 'together', 'unusual', 'circumstances', 'learn', 'live', 'others', 'inconsistencies', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'just', 'who', 'hell', 'are', 'world.That', 'statement', 'especially', 'true', 'Kannagi', 'Nagi', 'called', 'Jin', 'friends', 'side', 'minor', 'characters', 'are', 'good', 'too.As', 'watch', 'spend', 'time', 'together', 'do', 'find', 'wanting', 'know', 'more', 'them.It', 'just', 'damn', 'enjoyable', 'anime', 'hilarious', 'times', 'definately', 'emotional', 'ride', 'course', 'may', 'be', 'few', 'things', 'left', 'unknown', 'overall', 'charming', 'story', 'tell', 'really', 'cover', 'up.It', 'Volumes', '1', '2', 'one', 'disc', 'volume', 'open', 'ended', 'case', 'both.I', 'highly', 'recommend']",Kannagi: Crazy Shrine Maidens Complete Collection
