But still, I was looking forward to the remake, especially when I heard that Kathy Bates would be playing the role of the Ms. Hannigan, the villainous orphanage director.I thought Kathy Bates would be FANTASTIC as Ms. Hannigan, and she was. Unfortunately, as great as she is/was, she is not enough to pull of this movie by herself. Because with the exception of Kathy Bates, the rest of the casting was AWFUL!Although Alicia Morton (who played Annie) is cute, she just does NOT hold a candle to Aileen Quinn of the original 1982 version. While Aileen was nowhere near as adorable as Alicia, the character of Annie is supposed to be feisty, street-smart, sassy and tomboyish -- NONE of which Alicia can pull off successfully. But the casting of Alicia is nowhere near as bad as the HORRENDOUS casting of Audra McDonald as Grace Farrell, the secretary and later the love interest for Oliver WarbucksNow I am all for equality, justice and non-discrimination, and I absolutely abhor any kind of bigotry, racism & prejudice, but by the same token, there is also a lot to be said for being accurate and realistically true to history, especially when the setting of the work depicted is in past decades/centuries/millenniums. In all seriousness, in what world would an African-American woman be the personal secretary to a billionaire in the 1930s, let alone DATE him or marry him??Ever heard of anti-miscegenation laws which CRIMINALIZED interracial marriages or relationships??During the 1920s and 1930s, an African-American woman being in a position like that would unfortunately have NEVER have happened. It's sad & unfortunate but during those ""Jim Crow"" days. prior to the incredible work done by heroes like Martin Luther King, Rosa Parks, Malcolm X., Medgar Evers and others, and the passage of the Civil Rights Act, and its slowly increasing acceptance, interracial marriage was forbidden and neither black men and especially not black women were allowed to be in any positions of power. As the saying went back then, black women were relegated to being ""maids, mammies and mamas""! And what is it with casting Audra McDonald in every single remake?? She was also cast as the Mother Abbess in the recent live remake ofThe Sound of Musicand she was awful, not to mention historically inaccurate, there as well!This is NOT about either racism, multi-culturalism, or ""political correctness"" -- its about sheer historical inaccuracy, that stretches the limits of believability. Its like remakingGone with the Wind, and recasting Scarlett O'Hara with a Chinese woman, Rhett Butler with an African-American, Ashley Wilkes with a Latino, Melanie Hamilton with a Native American, India Wilkes with a woman from India (and I say that being of Indian descent myself!) and Mammy & Prissy with fair-skinned, blue-eyed blondes! Because that's what the ridiculous casting in these remakes basically amounts to -- changing the cast's characteristics, simply for the sake of political correctness and multi-culturalism, and the truth of history be damned!Unfortunately. the rest of the casting and acting in this movie is just as bad, if not worse!While Victor Garber is a great actor, he is too stiff and wooden for this role. Nearly every character is unbearably annoying and petulant, Rather than being lovable and adorable like the kids at the orphanage (especially Molly) in the original movie were, the kids come off as total brats. From what I saw and remember (I couldn't get through more than even half of this movie) with possibly the exception of Kathy Bates as Ms. Hannigan there was not been one single character in this production that I liked.What is it with everyone producing such AWFUL remakes of ALREADY-GREAT musicals & movies likeThe Sound of MusicandAnnie?? Why do they have to mess with perfection?!?So many people are saying that this 1999 Disney version is so much better than the original, and I just do NOT get it!!I've been watching the 1982 version or as long as I can remember and I still love it. It's a classic! .......it's one of the best ""Annie"" versions out there, if not the best! This version should NEVER have been made!! :(",1,What IS IT With People Producing Such AWFUL Remakes of ALREADY-GREAT Musicals & Movies?!?,1399680000,"05 10, 2014",2014,4257,"['originalAnniewas', 'released', '1982', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'version', 'most', 'part', 'still', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'remake', 'especially', 'when', 'heard', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'would', 'be', 'playing', 'role', 'Ms.', 'Hannigan', 'villainous', 'orphanage', 'director.I', 'thought', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'would', 'be', 'FANTASTIC', 'Ms.', 'Hannigan', 'was', 'Unfortunately', 'as', 'great', 'not', 'enough', 'pull', 'movie', 'herself', 'exception', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'rest', 'casting', 'was', 'AWFUL', 'Alicia', 'Morton', 'who', 'played', 'Annie', 'cute', 'just', 'NOT', 'hold', 'candle', 'Aileen', 'Quinn', 'original', '1982', 'version', 'Aileen', 'was', 'nowhere', 'near', 'as', 'adorable', 'Alicia', 'character', 'Annie', 'supposed', 'be', 'feisty', 'street-smart', 'sassy', 'tomboyish', 'NONE', 'Alicia', 'can', 'pull', 'off', 'successfully', 'casting', 'Alicia', 'nowhere', 'near', 'as', 'bad', 'HORRENDOUS', 'casting', 'Audra', 'McDonald', 'Grace', 'Farrell', 'secretary', 'later', 'love', 'interest', 'Oliver', 'WarbucksNow', 'am', 'equality', 'justice', 'non-discrimination', 'absolutely', 'abhor', 'kind', 'bigotry', 'racism', 'prejudice', 'same', 'token', 'also', 'lot', 'be', 'said', 'being', 'accurate', 'realistically', 'true', 'history', 'especially', 'when', 'setting', 'work', 'depicted', 'past', 'decades/centuries/millenniums', 'seriousness', 'what', 'world', 'would', 'African-American', 'woman', 'be', 'personal', 'secretary', 'billionaire', '1930s', 'let', 'alone', 'DATE', 'marry', 'Ever', 'heard', 'anti-miscegenation', 'laws', 'CRIMINALIZED', 'interracial', 'marriages', 'relationships', '1920s', '1930s', 'African-American', 'woman', 'being', 'position', 'would', 'unfortunately', 'have', 'NEVER', 'have', 'happened', 'sad', 'unfortunate', 'Jim', 'Crow', 'days', 'prior', 'incredible', 'work', 'done', 'heroes', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'King', 'Rosa', 'Parks', 'Malcolm', 'X.', 'Medgar', 'Evers', 'others', 'passage', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'Act', 'slowly', 'increasing', 'acceptance', 'interracial', 'marriage', 'was', 'forbidden', 'black', 'men', 'especially', 'not', 'black', 'women', 'were', 'allowed', 'be', 'positions', 'power', 'saying', 'went', 'back', 'then', 'black', 'women', 'were', 'relegated', 'being', 'maids', 'mammies', 'mamas', 'what', 'casting', 'Audra', 'McDonald', 'single', 'remake', 'was', 'also', 'cast', 'Mother', 'Abbess', 'recent', 'live', 'remake', 'ofThe', 'Sound', 'Musicand', 'was', 'awful', 'not', 'mention', 'historically', 'inaccurate', 'as', 'well', 'NOT', 'racism', 'multi-culturalism', 'political', 'correctness', 'sheer', 'historical', 'inaccuracy', 'limits', 'believability', 'remakingGone', 'Wind', 'recasting', 'Scarlett', ""O'Hara"", 'Chinese', 'woman', 'Rhett', 'Butler', 'African-American', 'Ashley', 'Wilkes', 'Latino', 'Melanie', 'Hamilton', 'Native', 'American', 'India', 'Wilkes', 'woman', 'India', 'say', 'being', 'Indian', 'descent', 'Mammy', 'Prissy', 'fair-skinned', 'blue-eyed', 'blondes', 'what', 'ridiculous', 'casting', 'remakes', 'basically', 'amounts', 'changing', 'cast', 'characteristics', 'simply', 'sake', 'political', 'correctness', 'multi-culturalism', 'truth', 'history', 'be', 'damned', 'Unfortunately', 'rest', 'casting', 'acting', 'movie', 'just', 'bad', 'not', 'worse', 'Victor', 'Garber', 'great', 'actor', 'too', 'stiff', 'wooden', 'role', 'Nearly', 'character', 'unbearably', 'annoying', 'petulant', 'Rather', 'being', 'lovable', 'adorable', 'kids', 'orphanage', 'especially', 'Molly', 'original', 'movie', 'were', 'kids', 'come', 'off', 'total', 'brats', 'what', 'saw', 'remember', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'more', 'even', 'half', 'movie', 'possibly', 'exception', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'Ms.', 'Hannigan', 'was', 'not', 'been', 'one', 'single', 'character', 'production', 'liked.What', 'everyone', 'producing', 'such', 'AWFUL', 'remakes', 'ALREADY-GREAT', 'musicals', 'movies', 'likeThe', 'Sound', 'MusicandAnnie', 'Why', 'do', 'have', 'mess', 'perfection', 'So', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'saying', '1999', 'Disney', 'version', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'original', 'just', 'do', 'NOT', 'get', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', '1982', 'version', 'as', 'long', 'can', 'remember', 'still', 'love', 'classic', 'one', 'best', 'Annie', 'versions', 'there', 'not', 'best', 'version', 'should', 'NEVER', 'have', 'been', 'made']",N/A
771588,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,B0000BWVNK,Mark Baker,"[20, 21]","I've always loved musicals.  They may be corny, and the idea of a bunch of people breaking out into the same song at the drop of a hat is unrealistic, but they are so much fun.  And done right, there's very little that entertains in the same way.These three made for TV musicals were done right.  Wonderful casts, gorgeous costumes and sets, and great choreography.  Everything a musical lover could possibly want.&quot;Rodgers and Hammerstein's Cinderella&quot; is the oldest, having premiered in 1997.  It tells the familiar story of the poor girl who goes to the ball and wins the heart of the prince thanks to her Fairy Godmother.  It stars Brandy, Whitney Houston, Bernadette Peters, Jason Alexander, and Paolo Montalban.  It looks incredible, like a story book come to life.  And it's lots of fun.  This is the only version of the musical I've seen, so I have nothing to compare it to, but I really enjoyed it.1999 brought the premier of a new version of &quot;Annie&quot; staring Alicia Morton, Kathy Bates, Victor Garber, and Audra McDonald.  This one stuck much closer to the original stage version, so I much prefer it over the original movie.  The rags to riches story of Annie is sheer fun with songs I love to sing along with.  I can get a goofy grin on my face as soon as I start watching that doesn't go away until after the movie is over.  And anyone worried about Kathy Bates, don't.  She is perfect as Miss Hannigan.Rounding out the set is &quot;The Music Man&quot; from spring of 2003.  This new adaptation stars Matthew Broderick and Kristin Chenoweth.  Again, this was the first version of the musical I saw, and I loved it.  It brings small town life of 90 years ago to life in a wonderful way while telling the story of a con man who gets and gives more then he bargained for in River City, Iowa.The DVD's are basically movie only versions.  Presented in their original full frame ratio, they look and sound great.  &quot;The Music Man&quot; does have a very brief behind the scenes documentary and a special performance of Kristin Chenoweth singing &quot;Till there was You.&quot;These movies are also available individually.  Either way, they are certainly worth getting.Any fan of musicals will love these new adaptations of some of the classics of the genre.  New fans will be born with these movies as well.  In two cases, it's certainly worked on me.",5,Three Winning Musical Adaptations,1074124800,"01 15, 2004",2004,2379,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'loved', 'musicals', 'may', 'be', 'corny', 'idea', 'bunch', 'people', 'breaking', 'out', 'same', 'song', 'drop', 'hat', 'unrealistic', 'are', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'done', 'right', 'very', 'little', 'same', 'way.These', 'three', 'made', 'TV', 'musicals', 'were', 'done', 'right', 'Wonderful', 'casts', 'gorgeous', 'costumes', 'sets', 'great', 'choreography', 'Everything', 'musical', 'lover', 'could', 'possibly', 'want.', 'quot', 'Rodgers', 'Hammerstein', 'Cinderella', 'quot', 'oldest', 'having', 'premiered', '1997', 'familiar', 'story', 'poor', 'girl', 'who', 'ball', 'heart', 'prince', 'thanks', 'Fairy', 'Godmother', 'Brandy', 'Whitney', 'Houston', 'Bernadette', 'Peters', 'Jason', 'Alexander', 'Paolo', 'Montalban', 'incredible', 'story', 'book', 'come', 'life', 'lots', 'fun', 'only', 'version', 'musical', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'have', 'nothing', 'compare', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'it.1999', 'brought', 'premier', 'new', 'version', 'quot', 'Annie', 'quot', 'staring', 'Alicia', 'Morton', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'Victor', 'Garber', 'Audra', 'McDonald', 'one', 'stuck', 'much', 'closer', 'original', 'stage', 'version', 'much', 'prefer', 'original', 'movie', 'rags', 'riches', 'story', 'Annie', 'sheer', 'fun', 'songs', 'love', 'sing', 'along', 'can', 'get', 'goofy', 'grin', 'face', 'as', 'soon', 'start', 'watching', ""n't"", 'go', 'away', 'movie', 'anyone', 'worried', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'do', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'Miss', 'Hannigan.Rounding', 'out', 'set', 'quot', 'Music', 'Man', 'quot', 'spring', '2003', 'new', 'adaptation', 'stars', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'Kristin', 'Chenoweth', 'Again', 'was', 'first', 'version', 'musical', 'saw', 'loved', 'small', 'town', 'life', '90', 'years', 'ago', 'life', 'wonderful', 'way', 'telling', 'story', 'con', 'man', 'who', 'more', 'then', 'bargained', 'River', 'City', 'Iowa.The', 'DVD', 'are', 'basically', 'movie', 'only', 'versions', 'Presented', 'original', 'full', 'frame', 'ratio', 'look', 'sound', 'great', 'quot', 'Music', 'Man', 'quot', 'have', 'very', 'brief', 'scenes', 'documentary', 'special', 'performance', 'Kristin', 'Chenoweth', 'singing', 'quot', 'Till', 'was', 'You.', 'quot', 'movies', 'are', 'also', 'available', 'individually', 'way', 'are', 'certainly', 'worth', 'getting.Any', 'fan', 'musicals', 'will', 'love', 'new', 'adaptations', 'classics', 'genre', 'New', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'born', 'movies', 'as', 'well', 'two', 'cases', 'certainly', 'worked']",N/A
