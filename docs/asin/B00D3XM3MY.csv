Since it is a double-dip, and since it looked like there was more (presumably) to the interviews, it would have been nice to have had more on this disc. Would have also been nice for Shatner to have had interviews with some of his co-stars about what they thought of him during his tenure on Trek- but since this is a Shatner production and since 3/4ths of the dvd cover has a giant closeup of him, it's foolish to NOT think that he would have treated his own 'mini-biography' with kid gloves. Would have been nice if there were a more objective director shooting this whole thing, but for what it is, we still get a lot of great tidbits (including one pretty horrible bit about how Kate Mulgrew was treated by Paramount and the execs on the last day of shooting Voyager) on very likeable actors that I didn't know about otherwise.

1653541,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00D3XM3MY,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[28, 31]","Actor William Shatner came up with an inspired idea in the documentary feature ""The Captains."" Adding a missing piece to the legacy of television's longest running space saga, the film united the six actors that have been featured as Captains in the show's various interpretations. Chris Pine from the current movies appeared in the full length film, but is not a notable part of the documentary series ""The Captains Close Up."" This five part series that appeared on the EPIX network (yeah, I don't know what that is either) is basically an expansion of the film. Each of the five episodes deals specifically with one of the TV captains. The interviews deal, obviously, with the Star Trek experience but also with their travails as actors in general. And Shatner steps forward both as subject and interviewer using footage he captured for the movie version.The five included episodes are each approximately 30 minutes in length for a total program content of about 2 1/2 hours. In addition, there is some Bonus interview footage with Shatner that is exclusive to the DVD release.The Five episodes are:1) William Shatner: Star Trek2) Patrick Stewart: The Next Generation3) Avery Brooks: Deep Space Nine4) Kate Mulgrew: Voyager5) Scott Bakula: EnterpriseAt the heart of the series is Shatner himself. He is, at once, the show's most valuable asset and one of its primary weaknesses. As a persona, he is as lively as ever. As an interviewer, however, he lacks a bit of focus constantly bringing any conversation back to what seems to be his favorite topic--himself. It is sometimes awkward, sometimes endearing. At the beginning of each interview, he seems to want to introduce some deep philosophical concept to make the casual get-togethers seem as if they are fraught with meaning. One of my favorite moments is when he is absolutely incredulous when Stewart says he was in an adult theater piece at the age of 12 (with bulging enthusiasm, ""How did you get into a play with adults?"" as if it were a strange concept for a budding thespian). Other odd moments include him singing along to Brooks' piano playing and the strangely sexist bend his interview with Mulgrew hits.Through it all, though, Shatner is an enthusiastic guide. The interviews may lack some insight, as I've mentioned, but they are entertaining enough. ""The Captains Close Up"" is certainly an easy recommendation for Star Trek enthusiasts, perhaps less so for others. If you've seen the film version of ""The Captains,"" you'll know exactly what to expect. If not, I might suggest that you sample that first. I'm not sure, having seen both the movie and now the series, that I felt both were essential. But again, if you're a fan, I suppose there are worse ways to spend your time.
