I checked out her filmography on IMDB and saw Kabluey, which seemed quirky enough for me and so it goes. She is in this for about 5 minutes total. One unexpected pleasure was seeing Terry Garr as an acerbic and disgruntled person, clearly out-of-character for her but done well. The theme is a new spin on out-sourcing. I have to say that I did enjoy this movie although some of it moved very slowly, as it was well played by leads quirky Scott Prendergast and Friend's alumna Lisa Kudrow. And by the way, that blue guy on the side of the road on the cover is NOT a cartoon.

It isn't laugh out loud funny and its darker side is certainly more prevalent than one may have initially thought.  It is subtle, but it makes a big impact as it lingers on the screen.  That said; there is an airy emptiness that also is prevalent and one that makes this a hard film to truly enjoy or at least fondly remember.It feels unlike anything else I've ever seen.  It isn't perfect as a whole, but in parts it is flawless.The story tells that of a desperate mother left to wrangle two seriously unruly children while her husband is away in Iraq.  To help, the man's loser brother comes, but he's almost more trouble than he's worth considering that he lacks any real skill.  He gets a thankless job as a roadside mascot of sorts and he begins to use this guise as a way to intake knowledge of everyone around him.  He observes and thus we observe and we start to see the reality of certain things that are not all what they seem.  The film's conclusion was pitch perfect for the direction things were headed, because it added a certain depth that could have been wasted on a perceived clich&eacute;.  Kudrow is wonderful as the exhausted mother, and Conchata Ferrell, Teri Garr and Christine Taylor all make the most of their scenes.  Scott Prendergast (who also directs) isn't particularly interesting, but his character is basically a doorway to another world, so as a prop he works well I suppose.I'm still not sure how I really feel about this movie.

First off Lisa Kurdrow is a wonderful actor.  I have seen her in several different parts and she never seems to stop shining a true artistic light on any role she takes.  Her supporting cast is ok, save Conchata Ferrell who is straight up delightful in this film.  The children are over played and certainly get the point across of being obnoxious, perhaps too much.I am not going to into great depth about the movie, but it is a unique story line that is not overly political as I thought it would be, though there are a few needless opinions.  Dad/Husband goes to war and Uncle comes to help is the basic plot, but what transpires from there is interesting.It is by no means some same old same old movie with too much drama.

1174827,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B001C4Z63E,Brian E. Erland,"[5, 5]","Doesn't the title of this film arouse memories of your childhood reading your favorite superhero comic book? Kabluey was one of the sounds indicating a loud, ground shaking explosion letting the reader know that the commencement of hostilities between powerful enemies had just begun.  I think the spelling was different but I believe the comparison is valid and accurate. The quirky '08 film `Kabluey' tells the tale of a family about to self-destruct. With the prolonged absence of her husband overseas fighting the war in Iraq poor Leslie (Lisa Kudrow) has fallen into deep depression mode and her two young sons aren't fairing much better. In an act of desperation she invites her inept, out of work brother-in-law Salman (Scott Prendergast) to move in and help take care of her two sons while she's at work.Upon his arrival it immediately becomes obvious that Salman is no better off than they are and hence the situation appears to be progressing from bad to worse. With Leslie's help Salman is hired to wear an outlandish blue costume and stand on the highway passing out brochures' advertising rental space. What first appears to be yet another disaster slowly begins to turn into a stroke of good fortune and Salman finds himself a popular figure amongst the local children attracted to the cartoon-like figure. Hiding within the `blue man' he discovers a part of himself that eventually gives him the strength and courage to do what he must do with or without the costume.`Kabluey' is one of those slow moving indie films that rely more on visuals and mood than on dialogue or storyline to sustain audience interest and that it does quite well. It also contains an off-beat soundtrack perfect for the surreal environment unfolding on-screen. Maybe not something that would stand up well to repeated viewings but certainly worth seeing at least once.",4,"""We're Being Attacked..., By Cheese"" ~ Heroes Come In Various Guises And Colors",1228521600,"12 6, 2008",2008,1859,"[""n't"", 'title', 'film', 'memories', 'childhood', 'reading', 'favorite', 'superhero', 'comic', 'book', 'Kabluey', 'was', 'one', 'sounds', 'indicating', 'loud', 'ground', 'shaking', 'explosion', 'letting', 'reader', 'know', 'commencement', 'hostilities', 'powerful', 'enemies', 'had', 'just', 'begun', 'think', 'spelling', 'was', 'different', 'believe', 'comparison', 'valid', 'accurate', 'quirky', ""'08"", 'film', 'Kabluey', 'tale', 'family', 'self-destruct', 'prolonged', 'absence', 'husband', 'overseas', 'fighting', 'war', 'Iraq', 'poor', 'Leslie', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'fallen', 'deep', 'depression', 'mode', 'two', 'young', 'sons', 'are', ""n't"", 'fairing', 'much', 'better', 'act', 'desperation', 'inept', 'work', 'brother-in-law', 'Salman', 'Scott', 'Prendergast', 'move', 'help', 'take', 'care', 'two', 'sons', 'arrival', 'immediately', 'obvious', 'Salman', 'better', 'off', 'are', 'hence', 'situation', 'be', 'progressing', 'bad', 'worse', 'Leslie', 'help', 'Salman', 'hired', 'wear', 'outlandish', 'blue', 'costume', 'stand', 'highway', 'passing', 'out', 'brochures', 'advertising', 'rental', 'space', 'What', 'first', 'be', 'yet', 'disaster', 'slowly', 'turn', 'stroke', 'good', 'fortune', 'Salman', 'popular', 'figure', 'local', 'children', 'attracted', 'cartoon-like', 'figure', 'Hiding', 'blue', 'man', 'part', 'eventually', 'strength', 'courage', 'do', 'what', 'must', 'do', 'costume.', 'Kabluey', 'one', 'slow', 'moving', 'indie', 'films', 'rely', 'more', 'visuals', 'mood', 'dialogue', 'storyline', 'sustain', 'audience', 'interest', 'quite', 'well', 'also', 'off-beat', 'soundtrack', 'perfect', 'surreal', 'environment', 'unfolding', 'on-screen', 'Maybe', 'not', 'something', 'would', 'stand', 'up', 'well', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'certainly', 'worth', 'seeing', 'least', 'once']",Kabluey

It's pointless, a waste of some talented individuals (Kudrow, Taylor & Garr)... and by the end of the film you care less about everyone involved... I would NEVER recommend this to anyone; not even an enemy.. I can't believe this movie even exists and that someone, somewhere, in some office, thought this was worth making. The film makes no statement (which isn't a bad thing), but it's not entertaining either....and what's really scary is that so many people seemed to loved it... the xanax crowd??Some reviewers on here have said there's political messages in it, which is completely false. It's set during war time, and the beginning is setting up a boring cliched plot and an excuse to let us know that a war bride can't keep it together while her hubby is away at war, which explains the two monster children... and the disconnected and estranged brother-in-law whose life was going nowhere when he's asked to come and watch the two demon seeds who have no structure or boundaries...Kudrow's character is cold, emotionless, unappreciative and very difficult to empathize with through out, and it's got to be one of the worst roles she's ever played..The film attempts to go where dozens of other films have gone, until the film ends up in a dead end & then suddenly, the husband does come home, but he's just a blurred one dimensional image (even though we were forced to see him in long shots throughout the film in photos hung on the wall)... maybe this was to keep him as a generic image to symbolize the common soilder...or..whatever...... But he never once acknowledges his brother who dropped his life to come help out.... And so the brother-in-law suddenly leaves and there's absolutely no resolution, except to say that he's a doormat, and she's a lying cold b***h who now has her husband back and they're going to live happily ever after in their suburban house and 2.5 kids...and a lie that will never surface because ""I really do love your brother... I do..I really do..No, really, I do..I do....... I do"".. MESS..Oh, Sorry, did I fail to put a spoiler alert at the top of my review??....ooops....Trust me, I'm doing you all a favor - you're welcome.

With a star as unbeatable as Lisa Kudrow as a mother who's husband is shipped off again to Iraq, leaving her with two monstrous sons, she can barely hang on.  Enter her brother-in-law loser (Scott Prendergast), also the director, and the film escalates.  Salman (loser brother-in-law) shows up to help with the kids, but only proves that he makes matters terribly, terribly worse.  Mom (Lisa Kudrow) is struggling with a full time job and the loneliness of no husband.  To help, Salman (the fish salmon jokes are endless) gets a demeaning job as a corporate mascot to hand out `office rental space' on a highway to nowhere.  From here, the plot moves on to the other community parents, other nasty kids, sexual gossip, affairs and much more than you would ever anticipate.  Teri Garr makes a great cameo as a disgruntled former employee of the `mascot's' firm.  Conchata Ferrell is a hilarious character actress that brings levity to every scene as Salman's boss (this woman is brilliant). The turnabout ending is perfect as truth comes visiting and the family dynamics produce a believable and welcome happy ending.To add:  I have never seen SO MANY deleted scenes as extras on any DVD.

Somehow we knew we were in trouble around the first fifteen minutes, or so.  We just didn't connect with the rather weak story, the contrived characters or the extremely flat production.  About 40-minutes in we determined there was no way things would get better, so we decided to call it quits.  But after stopping the DVD we wanted to see how the movie ended, so we popped it back in the player and went to the last few chapters.  It turns out we were pretty much on the money in predicting how it would end.  So, in addition to being hopelessly boring, it also suffered from a bad and totally predictable screenplay.

Enter Prendergast as Salman (like Salman Rushdie, he proudly proclaims), Leslie's ne'er-do-well but well-intentioned brother-in-law who comes to live with the family and ostensibly offer his assistance - though Salman may be in as much need of help as Leslie and the kids.""Kabluey!"" is distinguished primarily by its droll and understated visual humor, which comes primarily through the humiliating costume Salman is forced to don for his job delivering flyers advertising a flat-lining dot.com company to utterly uninterested and even dismissive passersby. Salman has been pretty much a failure his entire life, but he soon discovers that, even though he can lose himself and even take a proactive role by hiding his identity in the suit, it is ultimately only by shedding the costume that he can hope to grow up a bit and become a responsible, fully functioning adult.""Kabluey!,"" like most idiosyncratic independent comedies, captures the capricious flakiness of the people and environs of small-town life and the special quality of alienation that seems to reside in such places - and no one is more faceless and alienated than Salman when he's stuck in that suit. Its talented cast also includes Terri Garr (Kudrow's real-life mother and perfect voice-match), Christine Taylor, Jeffrey Dean Morgan and ""SNL"" and ""Portlandia""'s Chris Parnell.It's a nicely atmospheric look at post-9/11 America, one that mixes humor and pathos in roughly equal measure.",4,Endearing combination of subtle wit and broad visual physical humor,1330819200,"03 4, 2012",2012,1805,"['Scott', 'Prendergast', 'wrote', 'directed', 'stars', 'Kabluey', 'indie', 'comedy', 'quirky', 'offbeat', 'title', 'Friends', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'Leslie', 'small', 'town', 'woman', 'husband', 'been', 'off', 'fighting', 'Iraq', 'year', 'half', 'two', 'unruly', 'sons', 'are', 'more', 'harried', 'overstressed', 'mom', 'can', 'reasonably', 'cope', 'own', 'Enter', 'Prendergast', 'Salman', 'Salman', 'Rushdie', 'proudly', 'Leslie', ""ne'er-do-well"", 'well-intentioned', 'brother-in-law', 'who', 'live', 'family', 'ostensibly', 'offer', 'assistance', 'Salman', 'may', 'be', 'as', 'much', 'need', 'help', 'Leslie', 'kids.', 'Kabluey', 'distinguished', 'primarily', 'droll', 'understated', 'visual', 'humor', 'primarily', 'humiliating', 'costume', 'Salman', 'forced', 'don', 'job', 'delivering', 'flyers', 'advertising', 'flat-lining', 'dot.com', 'company', 'utterly', 'uninterested', 'even', 'dismissive', 'passersby', 'Salman', 'been', 'pretty', 'much', 'failure', 'entire', 'life', 'soon', 'even', 'can', 'lose', 'even', 'take', 'proactive', 'role', 'hiding', 'identity', 'suit', 'ultimately', 'only', 'shedding', 'costume', 'can', 'hope', 'grow', 'up', 'bit', 'become', 'responsible', 'fully', 'functioning', 'adult', 'Kabluey', 'most', 'idiosyncratic', 'independent', 'comedies', 'capricious', 'flakiness', 'people', 'environs', 'small-town', 'life', 'special', 'quality', 'alienation', 'reside', 'such', 'places', 'one', 'more', 'faceless', 'alienated', 'Salman', 'when', 'stuck', 'suit', 'talented', 'cast', 'also', 'Terri', 'Garr', 'Kudrow', 'real-life', 'mother', 'perfect', 'voice-match', 'Christine', 'Taylor', 'Jeffrey', 'Dean', 'Morgan', 'SNL', 'Portlandia', 'Chris', 'Parnell.It', 'nicely', 'atmospheric', 'look', 'post-9/11', 'America', 'one', 'humor', 'pathos', 'roughly', 'equal', 'measure']",Kabluey

He's called for a favor; to help his brother's wife and kids while he is away at war.The life at home is chaotic and Salman is not welcomed with open arms by  either of the two children or his sister-in-law Leslie(Lisa Kudrow).When Salman lands a job as a big blue character handing out fliers for open office space for rent on the side of a not-so-busy street, Salman begins to get some attention that he deserves.With a little help from the alien-like blue suit, Salman starts to turn his life around; performing at a child's birthday party, connecting with his nephews, and replacing a kind old man's thermos.Includes a great offbeat indie soundtrack and fabulous surreal and hilarious visuals, with cutting witty dialogue.Kabluey is enjoyable, entertaining and a lot of fun.
