Cisyk (billed as Kasey Cisyk in the credits) was an unknown backup and commercial jingle singer when she was hired by Joe Brooks to dub Didi Conn's vocals in his movie, ""You Light Up My Life.""  It was her beautiful rendition of the title song that filmgoers fell in love with, but Brooks chose Pat Boone's daughter Debbie to record the single version, so Boone got all the attention and the airplay (plus a Gold Record).  Cisyk can be heard on the complete soundtrack album but most people still credit Debbie Boone.  Director Carl Reiner properly recognized Cisyk's contribution to that hugely successful song and hired her to sing the title song in ""The One and Only.""  She was a beautiful singer who, tragically, died of breast cancer in 1998, leaving behind two gorgeous CD collections of Ukrainian folk songs. She was a great singer who never got the recognition she deserved.",4,Listen to the title song sung by Kvitka (Kasey) Cisyk,1284508800,"09 15, 2010",2010,1086,"['addition', 'delightful', 'comic', 'performances', 'Henry', 'Winkler', 'Kim', 'Darby', 'Gene', 'Saks', 'rest', 'cast', 'film', 'notable', 'being', 'last', 'major', 'English', 'language', 'recording', 'Kvitka', 'Cisyk', 'Cisyk', 'billed', 'Kasey', 'Cisyk', 'credits', 'was', 'unknown', 'backup', 'commercial', 'jingle', 'singer', 'when', 'was', 'hired', 'Joe', 'Brooks', 'dub', 'Didi', 'Conn', 'vocals', 'movie', 'Light', 'Up', 'Life', 'was', 'beautiful', 'rendition', 'title', 'song', 'filmgoers', 'fell', 'love', 'Brooks', 'chose', 'Pat', 'Boone', 'daughter', 'Debbie', 'record', 'single', 'version', 'Boone', 'got', 'attention', 'airplay', 'Gold', 'Record', 'Cisyk', 'can', 'be', 'heard', 'complete', 'soundtrack', 'album', 'most', 'people', 'still', 'credit', 'Debbie', 'Boone', 'Director', 'Carl', 'Reiner', 'properly', 'recognized', 'Cisyk', 'contribution', 'hugely', 'successful', 'song', 'hired', 'sing', 'title', 'song', 'One', 'Only', 'was', 'beautiful', 'singer', 'who', 'tragically', 'died', 'breast', 'cancer', '1998', 'leaving', 'two', 'gorgeous', 'CD', 'collections', 'Ukrainian', 'folk', 'songs', 'was', 'great', 'singer', 'who', 'never', 'got', 'recognition', 'deserved']",The One and Only VHS

223926,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,6300217027,David Baldwin,"[1, 1]","This a film that definitely deserves revisiting.  I saw it as a kid and was put off by the apparently obnoxious character, Andy Schmidt, played by Henry Winkler.  Apparently a lot of people were as well because it received a lukewarm critical and commercial response.  You could almost say it put a fork in Henry Winkler's nascent film career.  Give Winkler credit though for trying to put distance between his ""Happy Days"" character and his big-screen persona.  His previous cinematic effort was in ""Heroes"" where he played a troubled Vietnam vet.  Give Winkler kudos here for tackling a potentially unlikable role and by the film's end not only do you gain empathy for him you find yourself rooting for him to succeed.  The film is also blessed with an impeccable supporting cast.  Everybody here should be praised but special mention should be given to Gene Saks as a harried wrestling promoter and Herve Villechaize as a randy midget wrestler.  The script is by the late Steve Gordon who later achieved acclaim by profiling another potentially unlikable character in ""Arthur"".  Carl Reiner helms the film with an assured comic hand and perfectly captures the Fifties milieu which is a far cry from Arnold's Restaurant.

223928,A3BWP965RIWBCU,6300217027,"Gerald Parker ""Gerald Parker""","[1, 1]","When I had learned that it was the legendary ""Gorgeous George"" (George Raymond Wagner, 1915-1963) and his wife Betty who inspired those behind this movie, I was very eager to acquire and view this sweet little film on DVD. Well, the model that Gorgeous George set for the title role of Andy Schmidt (played by Henry Winkler) in ""The One and Only"" (which is what Andy likes to call himself, in the ring or in any other entertainment venue) is far removed in details from the real Gorgeous George. Andy is an eccentric fake as a wrestler, physically unfit for genuine wrestling; Gorgeous George, on the other hand, while not particularly imposing as a ring athlete, was, indeed, a skillful wrestler as well as a very amusing showman.My familiarity with Gorgeous George`s way of professional fighting comes from the years of seeing him in the ring when my family (parents, siblings, and, on other occasions, my paternal step-grandfather, too) used to watch Gorgeous George on TV during the late 1940s onward. The film only approximates that milieu, but it is very amusing on its own terms.Gorgeous George`s first wife Betty was a publically visible (and very pretty) part of his public persona, but Mary Crawford, Betty`s parallel in the film (played by Kim Darby) is shy, retiring, and of rather homely looks, rather than the publically visible companion to a celebrity wrestler as Gorgeous George`s lovely wife (n&eacute;e Betty Hanson) had been to some extent. Darby`s performance in the film, however, is almost as comical as Winkler`s, so, cinematically, it does not matter that much, does it? Andy`s trainer, the hilarious and philandering midget, Milton Miller (himself, in the film, a comedy wrestler, played by the diminuitive actor and painter, Herv&eacute; Villachaize) ""steals the show"" grandly, surely the funniest actor in this talented cast! The scene in which Milton flirts seductively and with grotesque inappropriety with Mary`s genteel mother, who finds the dwarf`s attentions utterly revolting, while both of Mary`s parents are visiting the young couple, is the single most side-splitting scene in what is withal a very hilarious film.There certainly is room for a genuine bio-film on Gorgeous George, the memory of whose career deserves to be honoured in that way, but for those who have any liking for wrestling (and I have to admit that my own interest only centred narrowly on Gorgeous George, a man of real class, however amusing, the others leaving me indifferent, especially the ring buffoons who came after him) and who have a strong hankering for film comedy (which I like a lot more widely!), this movie will likely be in their video machines rather often! It would have been desirable to include some ""extra features"" for this product (Legend Films LR-00210, as available in the U. S. of A. and Canada) that would make the background to ""The One and Only"" clearer to viewers too young to recall George Wagner, but, naturally, it is the motion picture itself that determines most buyer`s decision to purchase or to pass by on. It is the absense of special features on the DVD that results in the review`s rating of four rather than in five stars, but I still say, buy it and savour it!",4,"Gorgeous George Was Eccentric yet the ""Real Thing"" as Wrestler, but Andy is a Total yet Lovable Fake in Same Dubious Profession",1353369600,"11 20, 2012",2012,3212,"['When', 'had', 'learned', 'was', 'legendary', 'Gorgeous', 'George', 'George', 'Raymond', 'Wagner', '1915-1963', 'wife', 'Betty', 'who', 'inspired', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'eager', 'acquire', 'view', 'sweet', 'little', 'film', 'DVD', 'Well', 'model', 'Gorgeous', 'George', 'set', 'title', 'role', 'Andy', 'Schmidt', 'played', 'Henry', 'Winkler', 'One', 'Only', 'what', 'Andy', 'call', 'ring', 'other', 'entertainment', 'venue', 'far', 'removed', 'details', 'real', 'Gorgeous', 'George', 'Andy', 'eccentric', 'fake', 'wrestler', 'physically', 'unfit', 'genuine', 'wrestling', 'Gorgeous', 'George', 'other', 'hand', 'not', 'particularly', 'imposing', 'ring', 'athlete', 'was', 'indeed', 'skillful', 'wrestler', 'as', 'well', 'very', 'amusing', 'showman.My', 'familiarity', 'Gorgeous', 'George', 's', 'way', 'professional', 'fighting', 'years', 'seeing', 'ring', 'when', 'family', 'parents', 'siblings', 'other', 'occasions', 'paternal', 'step-grandfather', 'too', 'used', 'watch', 'Gorgeous', 'George', 'TV', 'late', '1940s', 'onward', 'film', 'only', 'milieu', 'very', 'amusing', 'own', 'terms.Gorgeous', 'George', 's', 'first', 'wife', 'Betty', 'was', 'publically', 'visible', 'very', 'pretty', 'part', 'public', 'persona', 'Mary', 'Crawford', 'Betty', 's', 'parallel', 'film', 'played', 'Kim', 'Darby', 'shy', 'retiring', 'rather', 'homely', 'looks', 'rather', 'publically', 'visible', 'companion', 'celebrity', 'wrestler', 'Gorgeous', 'George', 's', 'lovely', 'wife', 'n', 'eacute', 'Betty', 'Hanson', 'had', 'been', 'extent', 'Darby', 's', 'performance', 'film', 'however', 'almost', 'as', 'comical', 'Winkler', 's', 'so', 'cinematically', 'not', 'matter', 'much', 'Andy', 's', 'trainer', 'hilarious', 'philandering', 'midget', 'Milton', 'Miller', 'film', 'comedy', 'wrestler', 'played', 'diminuitive', 'actor', 'painter', 'Herv', 'eacute', 'Villachaize', 'show', 'grandly', 'surely', 'funniest', 'actor', 'talented', 'cast', 'scene', 'Milton', 'seductively', 'grotesque', 'inappropriety', 'Mary', 's', 'genteel', 'mother', 'who', 'dwarf', 's', 'attentions', 'utterly', 'revolting', 'Mary', 's', 'parents', 'are', 'visiting', 'young', 'couple', 'single', 'most', 'side-splitting', 'scene', 'what', 'withal', 'very', 'hilarious', 'film.There', 'certainly', 'room', 'genuine', 'bio-film', 'Gorgeous', 'George', 'memory', 'career', 'be', 'honoured', 'way', 'who', 'have', 'liking', 'wrestling', 'have', 'admit', 'own', 'interest', 'only', 'centred', 'narrowly', 'Gorgeous', 'George', 'man', 'real', 'class', 'however', 'amusing', 'others', 'leaving', 'indifferent', 'especially', 'ring', 'buffoons', 'who', 'came', 'who', 'have', 'strong', 'hankering', 'film', 'comedy', 'like', 'lot', 'more', 'widely', 'movie', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'video', 'machines', 'rather', 'often', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'desirable', 'include', 'extra', 'features', 'product', 'Legend', 'Films', 'LR-00210', 'available', 'U.', 'S.', 'A.', 'Canada', 'would', 'make', 'background', 'One', 'Only', 'clearer', 'viewers', 'too', 'young', 'recall', 'George', 'Wagner', 'naturally', 'motion', 'picture', 'most', 'buyer', 's', 'decision', 'purchase', 'pass', 'absense', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'results', 'review', 's', 'rating', 'four', 'rather', 'five', 'stars', 'still', 'say', 'buy', 'savour']",The One and Only VHS
