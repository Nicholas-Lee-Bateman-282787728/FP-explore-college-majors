While his history teacher (a Jew who we later learn had dated Danny's mother, but was driven off by the rest of the family's attitude) would like to see him expelled for good, the school principal (who happens to be black) would like to give him another chance - and gives him an assignment - to write a paper on the effect his older brother has had on his life.The older brother, Derek (Edward Norton) has been a bright kid, but turned into a 'skin head' neo nazi at a certain point in highschool - and things just got worse & worse until Derek has been incarcerated for killing a black man who tried stealing his car. Being charismatic, he's the most dominant member of his neo nazi gang - led by an older man (Stacy Keach) who doesn't like to get his hands dirty, so he lets the boys (led by Derek) to do it for him. Danny is also affected by Derek's rhetoric, and turns into a skin head himself when Derek isn't home.While writing his assignment, Danny flashes back into the family's history, trying to undertand why his older brother went for the white supremacy rhetoric in the first place, and hears his brother's ""change of heart in jail"" story (that may be a little too graphic), when trying to save his little brother from a fate he now understand is wrong.",5,Good movie despite some flaws...,1110499200,"03 11, 2005",2005,1839,"['bringing', 'up', 'important', 'lessons', 'wringness', 'neo', 'Nazism', 'white', 'supremacy', ""'touchy"", 'feely', ""'re"", 'here', 'teach', ""lesson'attitude"", 'film', 'using', 'standard', 'Hollywood', 'techniques', 'such', 'black', 'white', 'flashbacks', 'was', 'little', 'offputting.On', 'other', 'hand', 'performances', 'especially', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'direction', 'storytelling', 'made', 'up', 'quite', 'well.The', 'story', 'starts', 'present', 'Danny', 'Vineyard', 'Edward', 'Furlong', 'trouble', 'school', 'again', 'wrote', 'assignment', 'heroic', 'light', 'Adolf', 'Hitler', 'history', 'teacher', 'Jew', 'who', 'later', 'learn', 'had', 'dated', 'Danny', 'mother', 'was', 'driven', 'off', 'rest', 'family', 'attitude', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'expelled', 'good', 'school', 'principal', 'who', 'be', 'black', 'would', 'like', 'give', 'chance', 'assignment', 'write', 'paper', 'effect', 'older', 'brother', 'had', 'life.The', 'older', 'brother', 'Derek', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'been', 'bright', 'kid', 'turned', ""'skin"", 'head', 'neo', 'nazi', 'certain', 'point', 'highschool', 'things', 'just', 'got', 'worse', 'worse', 'Derek', 'been', 'incarcerated', 'killing', 'black', 'man', 'who', 'tried', 'stealing', 'car', 'Being', 'charismatic', 'most', 'dominant', 'member', 'neo', 'nazi', 'gang', 'led', 'older', 'man', 'Stacy', 'Keach', 'who', ""n't"", 'like', 'get', 'hands', 'dirty', 'boys', 'led', 'Derek', 'do', 'Danny', 'also', 'affected', 'Derek', 'rhetoric', 'skin', 'head', 'when', 'Derek', ""n't"", 'home.While', 'writing', 'assignment', 'Danny', 'back', 'family', 'history', 'trying', 'undertand', 'why', 'older', 'brother', 'went', 'white', 'supremacy', 'rhetoric', 'first', 'place', 'brother', 'change', 'heart', 'jail', 'story', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'too', 'graphic', 'when', 'trying', 'save', 'little', 'brother', 'fate', 'now', 'understand', 'wrong']",N/A

33695,A3BTP4OU2NQOXT,0780625129,"A. I. Baruti KMT-Sisouvong ""Baruti""","[6, 8]","American History X, Starring Edward Norton (as Derek Vinyard) and Edward Furlong (as Daniel ""Danny"" Vinyard), is one of the greatest silver screen efforts to bring to the fore a discussion regarding the construct of race and one of its many manifestations: hate both of others and yourself.  The movie delicately balances the topic in terms of thematic coloring, i.e. black and white for reflection and color for the present.  Not only is this technique, effective in reflection, it also serves as a symbol to encompass and discuss the antagonistic positions held between ""Blacks and Whites"" in the film as well.  However, more important than style, this movie has the potential to become a classic among all types of viewers, for it is a catalyst for discussions of change for all parties involved.American History X portrays the rise of a white supremacist organization and its impact on one Venice Beach family.  Told from the perspective of Danny, younger brother of Derek, who is a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Cameron Alexander, played by Stacy Keach, founder of the D.O.C., it also delves into the genesis of hate as it relates to the Vineyard family. Given that it is told from a perspective not widely portrayed in American media: from that of a member of a professed ""hate group,"" it captures the attention and imagination of the viewer with its charged storyline and reflective camera work.After meeting with Danny's History teacher regarding the inflammatory nature of an assignment, Sweeney, brilliantly played by Avery Brooks, says to Danny, ""so, here's the drill.  I'm your history teacher from now on.  We will discuss current events.  We will call this class American History X.  We meet once a day.  Your first assignment is to prepare for me a new paper, due tomorrow.  I want you to analyze and interpret all the events surrounding Derek's incarceration.  How these events helped shape your present perspective concerning life in contemporary America.""  Danny reluctantly agrees and sets out on a journey that will be both painful and enlightening.There are several poignant moments in the film; the first being when Derek takes one of the car thieves, and in killing him provides a tongue-across-the-teeth moment not soon forgotten.  Also, when Sweeney says, ""I am not disputing the fact that the child is confused. And he harbors some sick ideas.  But I'm not ready to give up on him yet.""  He goes on to say, ""this racist propaganda, this Mein Kampf psychobabble; he learned this nonsense Murray, and he can unlearn it too.  I will not give up on this child yet.""  Such a moment illustrates that as humans and social beings, our behavior is learned and acted out and the level of belief.Shot in past and present-time, American history X provides the viewer with many profound moments for consideration.  In one such instance, upon Derek's incarceration, one of his initial teachable moments comes in the form of fellow inmate Lamont, masterfully played by Guy Torry.  In an attempted dialogue, Lamont, after Derek is reluctant to talk, reminds him that his position, while incarcerated, is not one of privilege.  This appeared to be a sobering moment as to not only the reality of his situation, but of the rhetoric voiced by his mentor Cameron Alexander.As Derek begins to come to the realization of what white supremacy really is, via the action/inaction of his compatriots, his fellow inmates turn on him.  Having been dehumanized, Derek receives a visit from Sweeney.  During this visit, Sweeney asks him perhaps the most important question of his life; ""has anything you've done made your life better?""  With that question raging in his head, Derek begins a journey of self-discovery that eventually leads him away from the ideological rhetoric of his mentor, Cameron Alexander and the D.O.C., to the asking of weightier questions about what he has done not only to himself, but his family.With Sweeney's assistance, Derek begins to understand the construct of race and how he fell into the trap laid by Alexander.  Upon his release, Derek decides to confront Alexander and lay to rest the demons that haunted him during the three years of his incarceration.After the confrontation with Alexander and in a conversation with Danny, Derek begins to explain what he encountered in prison.  He discusses how angry he felt at the world and states ""nothing I ever did took that feeling away.""  Also, he explains how the rhetoric of white supremacy never helped him or the family, but only caused immense amounts of pain.  With this newfound understanding, he chose to leave it all behind.Another emotional moment occurs when Derek and Danny began removing the paraphernalia from Danny's room (note the voiceover of Danny's paper for Sweeney).  Such a moment not only brought them closer together, it also serves, symbolically, as another turning point in not only their respective lives, but the life of their family as well.American History X is a wonderful movie replete with thought-provoking subject matter.  As I viewed the movie, the constant question in my mind was ""how did this movie bypass the larger movie going public?""  Perhaps this observation/oversight is cause for an iteration on what the movie going public really wants to see; maybe next time.Note: the above is part of a work presented in a course on Deviant Behavior and Social Control.",5,"""Has anything you've done made your life better?""",1079654400,"03 19, 2004",2004,5375,"['American', 'History', 'X', 'Starring', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'Derek',

Derek is introduced as a racist scumbag in the first scene, when he kills a couple of black men in front of his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong); Derek is sent to prison and Danny gets so impressed with the actions of his older brother that he decides to follow his footsteps as a radical racist.Then the movie is divided in two kind of scenes: the black and white scenes, the flashbacks, where we can see the past of Derek, his thoughts about every person which is different to a white American person, he hates black people, Jews, Mexicans, Asiatic people, etc., he just hates them all. And then are the color scenes, the present, where we see a new Derek, a reformed Derek, he is now ashamed of his racist past, and now he has to fight to save his brother of following his footsteps.&quot;American History X&quot; is not a popcorn movie; is a powerful drama with strong scenes, strong language, and a very disturbing ending; it requires an open mind because the subjects that the story introduces to us may be controversial.Edward Norton is incredible as Derek, in this movie he offers his best performance so far, and that's saying a lot.

33702,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0780625129,Andrew Ellington,"[8, 10]","Fueled by a powerfully convincing Oscar worthy performance, `American History X' is probably my favorite movie of the given year.  It's an intense portrayal of hatred and racism and the causes behind it as well as the horrible consequences that spawn from it.  In its gritty black and white sequences it establishes an air of hostility and vindictive fervor, but what's strangely enamoring about this film is that, with all it's shocking violence and hate filled propaganda, it raises a level of sympathetic understanding that you'd never expect to find nestled underneath it's repelling shell.  Through the eyes of Derek Vinyard we begin to realize his struggle and understand his viewpoints, no matter how wrong they really are.  The reasoning behind his hatred is explained with such conviction and assurance that he begins to sell the audience.  This is important because Derek is a man we're supposed to connect with and sympathize with, and without understanding him that becomes impossible and he remains a monster to us.So then, much praise must be heaped upon the amazing Edward Norton who completely devours his role here.  His performance is one of the most impressive and earth shattering portrayals of the human heart I've seen in years, perhaps forever.  His control over his character is incredible.  His conviction, his determination, his grip on his characters reality is so strong it's engrossing and absorbing.  Derek Vinyard is a revelation.  As the film shifts from present time, with Derek being released from prison and trying to put his family back together, to past tense, where in that gritty black and white we see the rise and fall of Derek's Nazi days, we are invited into this mans world, and effortlessly we see Norton shift from a man determined to hate to a man determined to fix the mess he started.The film focuses mainly on the relationship between Derek and his younger brother Danny, played brilliantly by Edward Furlong.  Upon arriving home from prison Derek sees that Danny has now fallen just as deep into the race hating ways he was once privy to and he realizes he has his work cut out for him.  Having been reformed while behind bars Derek is now a much different man than he once was and he begins to try and reason with his brother, prove to him that the life they are leading is one only destined for failure and doom.  Unfortunately Danny has fallen into ties with Cameron, the leader of a group of Neo-Nazi tyrants who once worshiped the ground Derek walked on.  Breaking Danny of this pact would not only result in Derek's segregation but could result in his death.Tony Kaye does a fantastic job directing this film, creating an unsteady air about the scenes that adds layers to the message behind this film.  The film is forceful and blunt but it manages to invest itself so deeply in the audience that we become invested in the film and thus and compelled to keep watching despite the at times very harsh sequences of events.  `American History X' may not be the easiest film to sit through, but it's easily one of the most important films to ever address the bounds of racism.  Highly superior to the Oscar winning `Crash', `American History X' sets a profound statement that not only rationalizes with the villain but breaks down his barrier and exposes the scared little child growing within him.  Thanks in large part to the Oscar robbed Edward Norton, this is one of those films that will move you to rethink everything you think you know about the ones you think you understand and realize that maybe, just maybe, you don't know as much as you give yourself credit for.",5,Revolutionary filmmaking that grabs you and never lets you go...,1184198400,"07 12, 2007",2007,3627,"['Fueled', 'powerfully', 'convincing', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'performance', 'American', 'History', 'X', 'probably', 'favorite', 'movie', 'given', 'year', 'intense', 'portrayal', 'hatred', 'racism', 'causes', 'behind', 'as', 'well', 'horrible', 'consequences', 'spawn', 'gritty', 'black', 'white', 'sequences', 'air', 'hostility', 'vindictive', 'fervor', 'what', 'strangely', 'enamoring', 'film', 'shocking', 'violence', 'hate', 'filled', 'propaganda', 'level', 'sympathetic', 'understanding', ""'d"", 'never', 'expect', 'find', 'nestled', 'repelling', 'shell', 'eyes', 'Derek', 'Vinyard', 'begin', 'realize', 'struggle', 'understand', 'viewpoints', 'matter', 'how', 'wrong', 'really', 'are', 'reasoning', 'hatred', 'explained', 'such', 'conviction', 'assurance', 'sell', 'audience', 'important', 'Derek', 'man', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'connect', 'sympathize', 'understanding', 'impossible', 'monster', 'us.So', 'then', 'much', 'praise', 'must', 'be', 'heaped', 'amazing', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'who', 'completely', 'role', 'here', 'performance', 'one', 'most', 'impressive', 'earth', 'shattering', 'portrayals', 'human', 'heart', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'years', 'perhaps', 'forever', 'control', 'character', 'incredible', 'conviction', 'determination', 'grip', 'characters', 'reality', 'so', 'strong', 'engrossing', 'absorbing', 'Derek', 'Vinyard', 'revelation', 'film', 'shifts', 'present', 'time', 'Derek', 'being', 'released', 'prison', 'trying', 'put', 'family', 'back', 'together', 'past', 'tense', 'where', 'gritty', 'black', 'white', 'see', 'rise', 'fall', 'Derek', 'Nazi', 'days', 'are', 'invited', 'world', 'effortlessly', 'see', 'Norton', 'shift', 'man', 'determined', 'hate', 'man', 'determined', 'fix', 'mess', 'film', 'mainly', 'relationship', 'Derek', 'younger', 'brother', 'Danny', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Edward', 'Furlong', 'arriving', 'home', 'prison', 'Derek', 'Danny', 'now', 'fallen', 'just', 'deep', 'race', 'hating', 'ways', 'was', 'once', 'privy', 'work', 'cut', 'out', 'Having', 'been', 'reformed', 'bars', 'Derek', 'now', 'much', 'different', 'man', 'once', 'was', 'try', 'reason', 'brother', 'prove', 'life', 'are', 'leading', 'one', 'only', 'destined', 'failure', 'doom', 'Unfortunately', 'Danny', 'fallen', 'ties', 'Cameron', 'leader', 'group', 'Neo-Nazi', 'tyrants', 'who', 'once', 'worshiped', 'ground', 'Derek', 'walked', 'Breaking', 'Danny', 'pact', 'would', 'not', 'only', 'result', 'Derek', 'segregation', 'could', 'result', 'death.Tony', 'Kaye', 'fantastic', 'job', 'directing', 'film', 'creating', 'unsteady', 'air', 'scenes', 'layers', 'message', 'film', 'film', 'forceful', 'blunt', 'invest', 'so', 'deeply', 'audience', 'become', 'invested', 'film', 'thus', 'compelled', 'keep', 'watching', 'times', 'very', 'harsh', 'sequences', 'events', 'American', 'History', 'X', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'easiest', 'film', 'sit', 'easily', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'films', 'ever', 'address', 'bounds', 'racism', 'Highly', 'superior', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'Crash', 'American', 'History', 'X', 'sets', 'profound', 'statement', 'not', 'only', 'villain', 'down', 'barrier', 'scared', 'little', 'child', 'growing', 'Thanks', 'large', 'part', 'Oscar', 'robbed', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'one', 'films', 'will', 'move', 'rethink', 'everything', 'think', 'know', 'ones', 'think', 'understand', 'realize', 'maybe', 'just', 'maybe', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'as', 'much', 'give', 'credit']",N/A
33703,A2O7MOWVMSKO5J,0780625129,Andy Gill,"[15, 19]","It's difficult to gauge my feelings towards this film. It is incredibly powerful, shocking and moving, lasting long in your mind after the end credits have faded to black. The performances are particularly engaging, both Ed Norton and Edward Furlong giving career bests, and Stacy Keach, Elliot ""Father Gellar"" Gould, and Beverly ""Mother Griswald"" D'Angelo thankfully kept to an absolute minimum. The music, coupled with the bleak cinematography that cuts from black and white to slow motion to grainy textures and bleached colours, makes this a surprisingly emotional film, and the story line grips you throughout. What troubles me, however, is the subject matter, twinned with the charisma given off by Norton's fascist mastermind.The film is obviously sending out the message that it is wrong to be racist, and yet, just as `Falling Down' brought cheers of support from the white middle-classes, `American History X' may gain the same support. The appeal of Norton's character whilst he is in his racist phase is magnetic, to say the least, as the camera adulates him in glorious monochrome and voyeuristic slow motion, and his sociological (and fascist) dialogue is given a solitary forum from which to speak. So, you wait for the abuttal, the turnaround, the moment in which he realises his error, the adulation of an anti-racist, and the same sociological arguments that reverse what has been said before...and yet they never come. Indeed, it seems to make the point that racism is bad because it tears up your white middle-class family, and not because it is wrong. And so, though the ending is powerful and shocking from an emotional drama point-of-view, from a political viewpoint it is dangerous, because it does not reverse the seductive allure of racism that fills up the first half of the movie. Essentially, therefore, the film is full of rhetoric that argues racism has a valid and acceptable root, and is rather slim on evidence that racism is bad.I gave `American History X' four stars because of its power: just a look from the characters can rend your heart. When Norton is in the shower having been released from prison, he thinks back to his innocent childhood, and upon leaving the cubicle, sees himself in the mirror, complete with his Nazi tattoos, and the expression that crosses his face, added to the slow-motion footage and music, is incredibly moving. Likewise, the manic gleam in his eyes having killed the two men being replaced by despair upon realising he is going to be separated from his family strikes the heart. And yet I cannot fully commit to this movie because its surface anti-racist sentiment seems to hide an undercurrent of pro-fascist ideologies and aesthetics, in that never does the camera dwell upon a coloured person the way it does the white cast members. It is, however, a must-see movie, if only for the cinematic masterpiece that comprises the final scenes. Watching it as a drama, it is a great movie. Watching it as something else is deeply unsettling.",4,"Good, but troubling",988329600,"04 27, 2001",2001,3007,"['difficult', 'gauge', 'feelings', 'film', 'incredibly', 'powerful', 'shocking', 'moving', 'lasting', 'long', 'mind', 'end', 'credits', 'have', 'faded', 'black', 'performances', 'are', 'particularly', 'engaging', 'Ed', 'Norton', 'Edward', 'Furlong', 'giving', 'career', 'bests', 'Stacy', 'Keach', 'Elliot', 'Father', 'Gellar', 'Gould', 'Beverly', 'Mother', 'Griswald', ""D'Angelo"", 'thankfully', 'kept', 'absolute', 'minimum', 'music', 'coupled', 'bleak', 'cinematography', 'black', 'white', 'slow', 'motion', 'grainy', 'textures', 'bleached', 'colours', 'surprisingly', 'emotional', 'film', 'story', 'line', 'grips', 'What', 'however', 'subject', 'matter', 'twinned', 'charisma', 'given', 'off', 'Norton', 'fascist', 'mastermind.The', 'film', 'obviously', 'sending', 'out', 'message', 'wrong', 'be', 'racist', 'yet', 'just', 'Falling', 'Down', 'brought', 'cheers', 'support', 'white', 'middle-classes', 'American', 'History', 'X', 'may', 'gain', 'same', 'support', 'appeal', 'Norton', 'character', 'whilst', 'racist', 'phase', 'magnetic', 'say', 'least', 'camera', 'glorious', 'monochrome', 'voyeuristic', 'slow', 'motion', 'sociological', 'fascist', 'dialogue', 'given', 'solitary', 'forum', 'speak', 'So', 'wait', 'abuttal', 'turnaround', 'moment', 'error', 'adulation', 'anti-racist', 'same', 'sociological', 'arguments', 'reverse', 'been', 'said', 'yet', 'never', 'come', 'Indeed', 'make', 'point', 'racism', 'bad', 'up', 'white', 'middle-class', 'family', 'not', 'wrong', 'so', 'ending', 'powerful', 'shocking', 'emotional', 'drama', 'point-of-view', 'political', 'viewpoint', 'dangerous', 'not', 'reverse', 'seductive', 'allure', 'racism', 'up', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'Essentially', 'therefore', 'film', 'full', 'rhetoric', 'racism', 'valid', 'acceptable', 'root', 'rather', 'slim', 'evidence', 'racism', 'bad.I', 'gave', 'American', 'History', 'X', 'four', 'stars', 'power', 'just', 'look', 'characters', 'can', 'rend', 'heart', 'When', 'Norton', 'shower', 'having', 'been', 'released', 'prison', 'back', 'innocent', 'childhood', 'leaving', 'cubicle', 'mirror', 'complete', 'Nazi', 'tattoos', 'expression', 'face', 'added', 'slow-motion', 'footage', 'music', 'incredibly', 'moving', 'Likewise', 'manic', 'gleam', 'eyes', 'having', 'killed', 'two', 'men', 'being', 'replaced', 'despair', 'realising', 'going', 'be', 'separated', 'family', 'heart', 'yet', 'can', 'not', 'fully', 'commit', 'movie', 'surface', 'anti-racist', 'sentiment', 'hide', 'undercurrent', 'pro-fascist', 'ideologies', 'aesthetics', 'never', 'camera', 'dwell', 'coloured', 'person', 'way', 'white', 'cast', 'members', 'however', 'must-see', 'movie', 'only', 'cinematic', 'masterpiece', 'final', 'scenes', 'Watching', 'drama', 'great', 'movie', 'Watching', 'something', 'else', 'deeply', 'unsettling']",N/A

33707,ATXO4UA7N1HDC,0780625129,Ari Weiss,"[8, 9]","American History X: rated R, 1 hour and 58 minutes  American History X is a well-thought out thriller in which Edward Norton stars as an extraordinarily astute neo-nazi who becomes repentant for choosing the path of becoming a racist skinhead. The characters in the movie are exceptionally developed with skillful actors to match their complexity. Edward Furlong plays Norton's confused teenage brother. Furlong's acting is sensational, but Norton in particular displays talent literally beyond human conception. He delves so deep into the character of Derek Vinyard that he easily wins over the audience in thoroughly convincing them of his animosity. At one moment in the movie, Derek marches back triumphantly after brutally slaying a black man. In this flash, Edward Norton presents a facial expression like no other. His eyes are filled with deathly delight, his mouth twisted in a grin of sheer pleasure, and his cheeks glowing with the image of death. At this instant, as well as throughout the whole movie, Edward Norton puts in his greatest effort and captures and provokes the audience utilizing his incredibly skilled acting ability. I firmly believe that he is worthy of holding the best-actor title at this year's Academy Awards.  The plot of American History X starts off with Daniel Vinyard being assigned an enormous report containing all of the details on how his brother had become active in the nazi community, how that impacted his life, and all of the events leading up to the present day. Initially he is overwhelmed and does not take it seriously, but his brother, who just returns home to his family after being incarcerated for the murder of three men, forcefully urges Danny to complete the thesis. Danny titles the report American History X and proceeds to type it up with minimal success. As time passes by, Danny begins to undergo painful flashbacks involving his brother and his own childhood. He submerges into his past and progresses greatly with his life story. It becomes obvious that Derek is the main influence on him. Derek introduces Daniel to the life of hatred and crime. After their father dies trying to put out a fire, being shot by a colored man, the two boys' lives change dramatically. This is the supposed origin of Derek's loathsome ways. Later on, it is known that the source of Derek's anger goes much deeper beyond his father's death. Now out of prison, Derek seems to be strangely reformed. Jail has traumatized him and taught him a valuable lesson that he could not have possibly learned without his outstanding perception and intellect. The rest of the movie deals with Derek attempting to restore his own life and correct his younger brother's before it is too late.  Chilling and forceful, American History X is aimed directly at the hearts of sensitive Americans like myself. American History X is truly more frightening than any typical horror movie; it portrays the harshness and injustice of reality in an extremely effective manner. It is in my opinion, the most powerful and emotional movie of the decade. The movie is created as a wake up call to America. The violence, racial prejudice, and malevolence that take place concealed amongst the citizens of the US are expressed to a maximum velocity in the movie. As well as acting as a warning, the movie offers great insight into questions that many of us have forever yearned for the answers to. It accurately exposes the means by which a seemingly average and intelligent human being can be metamorphosed into a vicious and cruel hate monger.  American History X is an incredible entertaining and educational experience. The movie brought tears to my eyes during certain sequences and fury during others. It hit me head on with all of its intensity and I came out of the film perplexed and abysmal, yet in no way do I regret seeing it. I strongly would recommend that anyone with the tolerance for excessive violence and graphic depictions view this movie.Profound and mesmerizing, American History X, also starring Elliot Gould, Beverly D'Angelo, and Stacy Keach, directed by Tony Kaye, is in my eyes one of the most rich and enlightening movies of its time.

I'm a sucker for movies based on true stories.Derek Vinyard is a hate-filled white supremicist, a skinhead with a huge swastika tattooed on his chest. One night he's banging his girlfriend when his younger brother Danny notices the sound of someone breaking into Derek's truck. He looks out his bedroom window and there's a black guy trying to rip off the truck. He interrupts Derek's activities to tell him, and Derek goes out in his underwear with his semi-automatic weapon and guns down the thief and one accomplice. One of them is not dead, and raises his arm begging for mercy. The audience does not see until later how Derek responded.But Danny saw. Danny idolized his older brother and shaved his head, too. He also had several tattoos. Most of the story is told in flash-backs from the day Derek is released from prison and comes back to his largely dysfunctional family.Derek changed while he was in the prison at Chino, and I was just glad that the credit was not given to religion. Instead, his English teacher (later principal of the school when Danny is there) is the one who deserves some of the credit. I'm not going to tell you who else gets the credit for turning Derek into a decent fellow.When Danny turned in a history paper all about Adolf Hitler, his teacher (who used to date his mother) goes to the principal and wants him thrown out. The principal is not prepared to give up on Danny, and tells him that from now on he will be Danny's history teacher. They will call the class American History X, and Danny's first assignment is to write an essay all about his brother and his influence on him and on the community.Not gonna tell you any more. You just have to see it develop.

It can happen here, and a society that abandons  its youth to lives of hopelessness and impoverishment will learn the  lessons of history if it doesn't do more to rectify the causes underlying  such hate and discontent. This is a tough, gritty, and violent look at the  complex problems associated with race, poverty, and hopelessness that  pervade our inner cities and prey especially upon the young and vulnerable  teens trapped by life circumstance into these kinds of confrontations.  While George W. Bush waxes on so dreamily about his proposed Presidency not  ""leaving a single child behind"", the reality of the situation is quite  different; the stark economic realities of contemporary America is that  more and more urban youth are being abandoned and isolated in the midst of  all this unbelievable affluence for others.The movie is set up as a  kind of morality play; Edward Norton is a newly ex-convict hoping to turn  his life around by disassociating himself from the neo-Nazi group that led  him astray into a life of hate, violence, and murder a few years before.  Still, his younger brother, played well by Edward Furlong, is fascinated by  the power and allure of the neo-Nazis. As the movie progresses, we become  more familiar with just how it is that both brothers have become so  indoctrinated by hate, and left so susceptible to the racist messages of  the extremists. All of the cast, from Norton to Furlong to Eliot Gould to a  host of others are excellent, and this gripping story of how easily hate,  distrust, and violence beget more of the same is a sorry statement of what  the not so benign neglect of the society toward its less fortunate sons and  daughters can result in.

Towards the end I found it hard to pay attention.

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[2, 3]","AMERICAN HISTORY X is so powerful, so engrossing, so well-acted, that I sat in silence for some time after the last credit rolled past. The message of hate and how it affects generations is something so true and ingrained in our culture that it often defies logic. And so goes this film...Based on the true-life story of a white supremacist, Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton,The Painted Veil), the story leads us down a path many would probably not rather see, but must see in order to understand what hateful ignorance lay in wait in America (and beyond).After killing some black men trying to break into his car, Derek is sent to prison for several years, leaving his family to fend for themselves. Most notable is impressionistic brother Danny (Edward Furlong) who practically worships brother Derek. In high school, Danny taunts students of color and creates a few enemies that will ultimately be his undoing.Trying to save both Derek and Danny is high school principal Bob Sweeney (Avery Brooks), a black man on a mission to salvage the men from hatred (a great role for Brooks, too, second only to Norton's amazing performance).In prison, Derek learns a humbling lesson: those that are supposed to be your friends can be your worst enemies, and true friends can be color-blind. Derek becomes friends with an unlikely laundry buddy ...who happens to be black. The two form a bond based on trust and understanding, and a love for sports talk. Derek is surprised when he actually survives his prison term, only to learn that his survival was helped along by his friend of color. Derek has awakened to his loss of hatred of colored people (and Jews), and realizes that he has to try and save brother Danny from a similar fate.But can he...Edging his way back into the family, Derek distances himself from his disturbing past, but will it be in time to save his beloved skinhead brother?Without a doubt, the film's ending can be viewed as fatalistic. We don't know what Derek is going to do but we are left with an inkling of hope that he'll stay true on his new path. Whether he would or not is left up to the audience to decide.Which is why I remained sitting, staring at a black screen after the credits finished rolling. I wanted to see my hopeful thoughts come true; to see Derek rise up and defeat his demons. I didn't want to see what `might' happen.I hope...An incredibly powerful performance by Norton and an even more powerful message of (possible) redemption ...with a terrible cost.",5,Sitting In Awe Of Norton's Performance And The Film's Message...,1241308800,"05 3, 2009",2009,2491,"['AMERICAN', 'HISTORY', 'X', 'so', 'powerful', 'so', 'engrossing', 'so', 'well-acted', 'sat', 'silence', 'time', 'last', 'credit', 'rolled', 'past', 'message', 'hate', 'how', 'generations', 'something', 'so', 'true', 'ingrained', 'culture', 'often', 'logic', 'so', 'film', 'Based', 'true-life', 'story', 'white', 'supremacist', 'Derek', 'Vinyard', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'Painted', 'Veil', 'story', 'down', 'path', 'many', 'would', 'probably', 'not', 'rather', 'see', 'must', 'see', 'order', 'understand', 'what', 'hateful', 'ignorance', 'lay', 'wait', 'America', '.After', 'killing', 'black', 'men', 'trying', 'break', 'car', 'Derek', 'sent', 'prison', 'several', 'years', 'leaving', 'family', 'fend', 'Most', 'notable', 'impressionistic', 'brother', 'Danny', 'Edward', 'Furlong', 'who', 'practically', 'brother', 'Derek', 'high', 'school', 'Danny', 'students', 'color', 'few', 'enemies', 'will', 'ultimately', 'be', 'undoing.Trying', 'save', 'Derek', 'Danny', 'high', 'school', 'principal', 'Bob', 'Sweeney', 'Avery', 'Brooks', 'black', 'man', 'mission', 'salvage', 'men', 'hatred', 'great', 'role', 'Brooks', 'too', 'second', 'only', 'Norton', 'amazing', 'performance', '.In', 'prison', 'Derek', 'humbling', 'lesson', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'friends', 'can', 'be', 'worst', 'enemies', 'true', 'friends', 'can', 'be', 'color-blind', 'Derek', 'friends', 'unlikely', 'laundry', 'buddy', 'who', 'be', 'black', 'two', 'form', 'bond', 'based', 'trust', 'understanding', 'love', 'sports', 'talk', 'Derek', 'surprised', 'when', 'actually', 'prison', 'term', 'only', 'learn', 'survival', 'was', 'helped', 'friend', 'color', 'Derek', 'awakened', 'loss', 'hatred', 'colored', 'people', 'Jews', 'try', 'save', 'brother', 'Danny', 'similar', 'fate.But', 'can', 'Edging', 'way', 'back', 'family', 'Derek', 'disturbing', 'past', 'will', 'be', 'time', 'save', 'beloved', 'skinhead', 'brother', 'doubt', 'film', 'ending', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'fatalistic', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'Derek', 'going', 'do', 'are', 'left', 'inkling', 'hope', ""'ll"", 'stay', 'true', 'new', 'path', 'would', 'not', 'left', 'up', 'audience', 'decide.Which', 'why', 'remained', 'sitting', 'staring', 'black', 'screen', 'credits', 'finished', 'rolling', 'wanted', 'see', 'hopeful', 'thoughts', 'come', 'true', 'see', 'Derek', 'rise', 'up', 'defeat', 'demons', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'what', 'might', 'happen.I', 'hope', 'incredibly', 'powerful', 'performance', 'Norton', 'even', 'more', 'powerful', 'message', 'possible', 'redemption', 'terrible', 'cost']",N/A
33729,A1QDQT0ZAAZHQS,0780625129,BookMania,"[2, 2]","This movie frightened me more than any movie I had ever seen before, mainly because the content is more than just a brilliant story, but an eye-opening reality in many places across America.  I was so frightened that I couldn't even stay in the theater after the movie was over to watch the end credits.There are two separate and distinct storylines in this movie that are interwoven in order to give the audience the entire picture.  Half the movie is shot in color, symbolizing the present day.  The other half is black and white, representing things that had occurred two years earlier, before Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) was incarcerated.  The movie starts out in black and white, with a gruesome scene where Derek, a white supremacist, executes two African-Americans on his front yard for trying to steal his car.  Subsequent black and white scenes will explain the reasons why these guys were trying to seek revenge by stealing the car.  For his actions, Derek goes to prison for two years, during which time he better grasps the realities of his hatred and decides to change his perspective when he is released.  The present day scenes show Derek and his attempt to dissuade his brother Danny (Edward Furlong) from following in his footsteps.Director Tony Kaye does a brilliant job of concurrently narrating both of these story lines.  Simultaneously, Kaye shows how hate is learned, and also how it can be unlearned.  Though, this isn't really a movie about how things SHOULD be, but about how things ARE.  While I'm not going to give away the ending, I will say that the battle against racism and hatred is not furthered at the story's conclusion.  ...  However, here we have a movie about an educated, articulate man who believes that he can intelligently justify his rage against anyone who isn't white Protestant.There are several great performances in this movie.  Of course, there's the brilliant performance by Edward Norton, who was rightfully nominated for an Academy Award for this role and probably should have won.  Beverly D'Angelo was also outstanding in the role of Derek and Danny's mother.  I still get goosebumps when I think of her character screaming out that ""the only thing [she's] ashamed of is that [Derek] came out of her body.""  Avery Brooks is also excellent as a high school principal who can be both intimidating and compassionate.  Finally, I have to acknowledge the performance of Ethan Suplee as Seth, the bumbling and impressionable lackey.  Playing a lackey isn't new to Suplee, who had a recurring role on ""Boy Meets World"" as the brainless sidekick to the school bully.  He plays the same character here, except that this role is far more powerful and emotionally charged.  There's a memorable scene in the movie where he's driving down the street in a van singing ""The Battle Hymn of the Republic"" substituted with White Power lyrics.This is an extremely violent movie with many graphic scenes that are definitely not suitable for children and even adults would find disturbing.  However, this movie is extremely compelling, and definitely a must-see.",5,"It'll Startle You, Then Make You Think",1041206400,"12 30, 2002",2002,3098,"['movie', 'frightened', 'more', 'movie', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'mainly', 'content', 'more', 'just', 'brilliant', 'story', 'eye-opening', 'reality', 'many', 'places', 'America', 'was', 'so', 'frightened', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'stay', 'theater', 'movie', 'was', 'watch', 'end', 'are', 'two', 'separate', 'distinct', 'storylines', 'movie', 'are', 'interwoven', 'order', 'give', 'audience', 'entire', 'picture', 'movie', 'shot', 'color', 'symbolizing', 'present', 'day', 'other', 'half', 'black', 'white', 'representing', 'things', 'had', 'occurred', 'two', 'years', 'earlier', 'Derek', 'Vinyard', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'was', 'incarcerated', 'movie', 'out', 'black', 'white', 'gruesome', 'scene', 'where', 'Derek', 'white', 'supremacist', 'two', 'African-Americans', 'front', 'yard', 'trying', 'steal', 'car', 'Subsequent', 'black', 'white', 'scenes', 'will', 'explain', 'reasons', 'why', 'guys', 'were', 'trying', 'seek', 'revenge', 'stealing', 'car', 'actions', 'Derek', 'prison', 'two', 'years', 'time', 'better', 'grasps', 'realities', 'hatred', 'decides', 'change', 'perspective', 'when', 'released', 'present', 'day', 'scenes', 'show', 'Derek', 'attempt', 'dissuade', 'brother', 'Danny', 'Edward', 'Furlong', 'following', 'footsteps.Director', 'Tony', 'Kaye', 'brilliant', 'job', 'concurrently', 'narrating', 'story', 'lines', 'Simultaneously', 'Kaye', 'how', 'hate', 'learned', 'also', 'how', 'can', 'be', 'unlearned', 'Though', ""n't"", 'really', 'movie', 'how', 'things', 'SHOULD', 'be', 'how', 'things', 'ARE', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'give', 'away', 'ending', 'will', 'say', 'battle', 'racism', 'hatred', 'not', 'furthered', 'story', 'conclusion', 'However', 'here', 'have', 'movie', 'educated', 'articulate', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'intelligently', 'justify', 'rage', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'white', 'Protestant.There', 'are', 'several', 'great', 'performances', 'movie', 'course', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'who', 'was', 'rightfully', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Award', 'role', 'probably', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'Beverly', ""D'Angelo"", 'was', 'also', 'outstanding', 'role', 'Derek', 'Danny', 'mother', 'still', 'get', 'goosebumps', 'when', 'think', 'character', 'screaming', 'out', 'only', 'thing', '[', ']', 'ashamed', '[', 'Derek', ']', 'came', 'body', 'Avery', 'Brooks', 'also', 'excellent', 'high', 'school', 'principal', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'intimidating', 'compassionate', 'Finally', 'have', 'acknowledge', 'performance', 'Ethan', 'Suplee', 'Seth', 'bumbling', 'impressionable', 'lackey', 'Playing', 'lackey', ""n't"", 'new', 'Suplee', 'who', 'had', 'recurring', 'role', 'Boy', 'Meets', 'World', 'brainless', 'sidekick', 'school', 'bully', 'same', 'character', 'here', 'role', 'far', 'more', 'powerful', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'memorable', 'scene', 'movie', 'where', 'driving', 'down', 'street', 'van', 'singing', 'Battle', 'Hymn', 'Republic', 'substituted', 'White', 'Power', 'lyrics.This', 'extremely', 'violent', 'movie', 'many', 'graphic', 'scenes', 'are', 'definitely', 'not', 'suitable', 'children', 'even', 'adults', 'would', 'find', 'disturbing', 'However', 'movie', 'extremely', 'compelling', 'definitely', 'must-see']",N/A

There's a deep undertone of violence from the opening moments when we see the star, Norton, interrupted while having sex in order to dash outside and shoot the two hoods burglarizing his car. We are then subjected to back and forth time shifting, on top of all the other movie-making gimmicks. At heart, the message is that hate kills. However, I was unconvinced that the white supremacist skinhead who went to prison for the killings would ever emerge fully cured of his racism, as we are expected to believe here.

33733,A5LNIF5QPQ0G6,0780625129,Brian A. Gross,"[2, 5]","""Hate, is baggage.""  Those, along with a quote from Abraham Lincoln, are the last words spoken in the final narration of American History X; a movie with so much depth and character that it makes the regular Hollywood fare look like student films in comparison.  Amazingly, it has a first time feature director in Tony Kaye and a freshman screenwriter in David McKenna.Danny Vinyard's (Edward Furlong) young life has seen its share of pain and turmoil: first, his father is murdered doing his job and then he witnesses his older brother Derek (Edward Norton) murdering two would-be robbers.  Derek is a kind of &uuml;ber neo-Nazi, an Honors English student in High School and a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of the local racist leader, Cameron Alexander (Stacey Keach).  He is also Danny's hero.  After their dad is killed fighting a fire in a Compton crack den, Derek turns his hate into action and becomes a leader of the growing White Power movement in Venice Beach.  He is never a true believer though -- the group is an outlet for his charismatic personality and his rage at things he doesn't understand.  Cameron is right there to focus the attention of hopeless, young white kids like him and gives them an excuse to be angry, and stay angry.The story, mostly told by Danny, is featured in black and white flashbacks with the current story told in color.  It opens with Danny in Dr. Sweeney's office (Avery Brooks as the principal) for writing a civil rights paper entitled ""My Mien Kampf.""  It is the same day Derek is released from Chino after serving three plus years for homicide for the aforementioned killings.  When Danny finally sees Derek again he realizes that he has come home a man, and we witness one of the most powerful stories of redemption I have ever seen.  We cannot truly know how far he has come until we see where he has been.  Where he has been is told in a brutal, graphic and final manner but it does provide the basis for his evolution.When Derek goes into prison he is a hardened young man.  He immediately makes his presence known to the Aryan convicts and is safe with them.  Little does he realize his attitude of purity and adherence to philosophy gets him nowhere here.  He becomes jaded from the compromise he sees his posse making and goes off on his own.  After being raped and humiliated by one of his own men, Derek is visited by Dr. Sweeney, who offers his help.  He tells Derek about his own angry days of youth:""I used to be mad too.  Mad at everyone.  Mad at society, white people, God.  I had all the wrong answers but I wasn't asking the right questions.  You need to ask the right questions, Derek.""""Like what?""""Has anything you've done made your life better?""The slow headshake Derek gives is the turning point.  His only contention left is to deal with the prison's black population (the ""brothers"") who will be gunning for him.  As he is leaving he realizes that the young black guy who befriended him, and broke down his perceptions, had put out the word that he be left alone.  Derek has grace extended to him and doesn't even realize it.  He only understands the mercy he has lived under as he is leaving, but it has already changed him.  Dr. Sweeney gives him help too, but it is a conditional grace based on his heart change.Both of them are worried about Danny and they both realize that he is headed down the same path Derek is departing from.Not only is Derek a man of honor when he comes home, he displays a compassion and protectiveness of his family he hasn't had for years.  He is clearly appalled at where they have to live and they are his top priority now.  He does make mistakes and lashes out in anger several times but that is what makes him the man he is; a character fully realized.  He is about his business of severing the ties that bind him to his old life (even some very personal ones) and rebuilding the new life he has been given.X is an emotional and moving piece of work, a wonderful marriage of image, writing, and acting.  Mr. McKenna boldly draws characters, not caricatures.  He does not rely on the handy crutch of pathos but allows his progeny to live and move amongst the rest of us.  The material he supplies allows Edward Norton to shine and give an Oscar-worthy performance.  Mr. Kaye shows a flair for the showy image at times but as Edward Norton states: ""his visuals...are wholly unique"" and he does make his presence felt less than many other Hollywood directors.On a side note, during post-production, the director decided he did not want his name anywhere on the picture and is still bad-mouthing it to this day.  (He considers it ""raped"" by Edward Norton -- whom he calls a ""narcissistic dilettante"" -- and New Line Cinema, when he was refused more money and time for a third edit).  What is more ironic is this egotistical clown, who is by his own estimation ""the greatest English filmmaker since Alfred Hitchcock,"" could win an award for his work on the movie; work he fought months to damage and have his name replaced with a pseudonym.  When asked about wanting to have his credits read `Humpty Dumpty' he explained ""Its all about the fall of mankind..."" -- my guess is that would be anything that removes Tony Kaye from the spotlight, with his teeth marks still planted on it.",5,Complex Racial Issues - Great Screenwriting,985564800,"03 26, 2001",2001,5273,"['Hate', 'baggage', 'quote', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'are', 'last', 'words',

Also, I heard of it before. As I got into the movie, I began to enjoy, unlike a lot of the movies on this channel.The movies about a young teenager who really wants to be a skinhead like his older brother Derek Vinyard, who is famous for starting up a group of skinheads in Venus Beach, California. The trouble start up when Derek goes off to jail for killing two young African Americans who were breaking into his car on night.The movie starts off with Danny, the young skinhead brother, getting in trouble with the principle of his school, who happens to be African American, for writing a book report on Mein Kumph, Adolf Hitler's autobiography. The teacher now sends Danny into a class which he will teach named American History X. To start off the class, Danny has to write a new report on his brother Derek. Even though Danny hates the idea, he still agrees to write the paper.Around this time, Derek is released from jail. However, his look has changed. He no longer pocesses his rebellious bald scalp, but a full head of hair. He is met early by the still bald-headed Danny, who tells him about the report he has to do. Shocking to the boy, Derek tells him to do the report, and says it wasn't a good idea for him to write on Hitler. Derek also discovers that Danny has joined the group that he had been a part of, and taken the same mentor that Derek took when he was a skin.Intense, disturbing, and touching at times, American History X gives the story of a family who has been torn down by racism. With excellant performances from Edward Nortan and Edward Furlong, this movie packs a message about the neo-Nazi skinheads of America. This is definatly a movie anyone on the planet shoulld see. It pulls in family, anti-racism, and changes that will shock you until the end.",5,Excellant Movie!,1055116800,"06 9, 2003",2003,1925,"['was', 'sitting', 'around', 'watching', 'Independent', 'Film', 'Channel', 'when', 'sudden', 'movie', 'came', 'looked', 'good', 'decided', 'watch', 'Also', 'heard', 'before', 'got', 'movie', 'began', 'enjoy', 'lot', 'movies', 'channel.The', 'movies', 'young', 'teenager', 'who', 'really', 'be', 'skinhead', 'older', 'brother', 'Derek', 'Vinyard', 'who', 'famous', 'starting', 'up', 'group', 'skinheads', 'Venus', 'Beach', 'California', 'trouble', 'start', 'up', 'when', 'Derek', 'jail', 'killing', 'two', 'young', 'African', 'Americans', 'who', 'were', 'breaking', 'car', 'night.The', 'movie', 'Danny', 'young', 'skinhead', 'brother', 'getting', 'trouble', 'principle', 'school', 'who', 'be', 'African', 'American', 'writing', 'book', 'report', 'Mein', 'Kumph', 'Adolf', 'Hitler', 'autobiography', 'teacher', 'now', 'Danny', 'class', 'will', 'teach', 'named', 'American', 'History', 'X', 'start', 'off', 'class', 'Danny', 'write', 'new', 'report', 'brother', 'Derek', 'Even', 'Danny', 'idea', 'still', 'write', 'paper.Around', 'time', 'Derek', 'released', 'jail', 'However', 'look', 'changed', 'no', 'longer', 'rebellious', 'bald', 'scalp', 'full', 'head', 'hair', 'met', 'early', 'still', 'bald-headed', 'Danny', 'who', 'report', 'do', 'Shocking', 'boy', 'Derek', 'do', 'report', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'idea', 'write', 'Hitler', 'Derek', 'also', 'Danny', 'joined', 'group', 'had', 'been', 'part', 'taken', 'same', 'mentor', 'Derek', 'took', 'when', 'was', 'skin.Intense', 'disturbing', 'touching', 'times', 'American', 'History', 'X', 'story', 'family', 'who', 'been', 'torn', 'down', 'racism', 'excellant', 'performances', 'Edward', 'Nortan', 'Edward', 'Furlong', 'movie', 'message', 'neo-Nazi', 'skinheads', 'America', 'definatly', 'movie', 'anyone', 'planet', 'shoulld', 'see', 'family', 'anti-racism', 'changes', 'will', 'shock', 'end']",N/A
33735,A36WS7A1CHIB4B,0780625129,"Brooke Pennington ""Renaissance girl""","[2, 3]","The acting in this film, if cut away from the plot and directing, would definitely rate 5 stars.  Unfortunately the other elements of the film drag it down just a bit, but it remains a thought-provoking and affecting film.The plot centers around two sons in a Venice Beach, CA family.  The older son, Derek Vinyard, is a former neo-Nazi skinhead who has just been released from prison (he killed two black men while still a skinhead).  He comes home to find that his younger brother Danny is headed down the same path, and tries to convince Danny to turn his life around before it is too late.  The film starts off very promisingly, with incredible performances from Edward Norton and Edward Furlong.  The only minor annoyance is the use of a contrived technique that uses black-and-white for flashbacks and color for present-day events.  Dialogue is snappy, and the rantings of Norton's character have an eerie half-logic that can almost make you understand why Derek gains so many followers.  There are a string of striking images, such as skinheads bathing a black store clerk in milk during a robbery.  The film stays strong until after its midpoint, but it begins to descend into plot contrivances and melodrama.  These notes make the ending utterly unsatisfying and a little disappointing, considering what came before.  It remains a powerful movie, but tantalizes with the prospect of how great it could have been had the third-act denouement not descended into overdone predicability.A final note:  very interesting casting sees supporting performances from Beverly D'Angelo, Fairuza Balk, Ethan Suplee, and even Paul Le Mat from ""American Graffiti"".",4,"Gripping, well-acted, but a little contrived",1057708800,"07 9, 2003",2003,1658,"['acting', 'film', 'cut', 'away', 'plot', 'directing', 'would', 'definitely', 'rate', '5', 'stars', 'Unfortunately', 'other', 'elements', 'film', 'drag', 'down', 'just', 'bit', 'thought-provoking', 'affecting', 'film.The', 'plot', 'centers', 'two', 'sons', 'Venice', 'Beach', 'CA', 'family', 'older', 'son', 'Derek', 'Vinyard', 'former', 'neo-Nazi', 'skinhead', 'who', 'just', 'been', 'released', 'prison', 'killed', 'two', 'black', 'men', 'still', 'skinhead', 'home', 'find', 'younger', 'brother', 'Danny', 'headed', 'same', 'path', 'tries', 'convince', 'Danny', 'turn', 'life', 'too', 'late', 'film', 'off', 'very', 'promisingly', 'incredible', 'performances', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'Edward', 'Furlong', 'only', 'minor', 'annoyance', 'use', 'contrived', 'technique', 'black-and-white', 'flashbacks', 'color', 'present-day', 'events', 'Dialogue', 'snappy', 'rantings', 'Norton', 'character', 'have', 'eerie', 'half-logic', 'can', 'almost', 'make', 'understand', 'why', 'Derek', 'gains', 'so', 'many', 'followers', 'are', 'string', 'striking', 'images', 'such', 'skinheads', 'bathing', 'black', 'store', 'clerk', 'milk', 'robbery', 'film', 'strong', 'midpoint', 'descend', 'plot', 'contrivances', 'melodrama', 'notes', 'make', 'ending', 'utterly', 'unsatisfying', 'little', 'disappointing', 'considering', 'what', 'came', 'before', 'powerful', 'movie', 'prospect', 'how', 'great', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'third-act', 'denouement', 'not', 'descended', 'overdone', 'predicability.A', 'final', 'note', 'very', 'interesting', 'casting', 'sees', 'supporting', 'performances', 'Beverly', ""D'Angelo"", 'Fairuza', 'Balk', 'Ethan', 'Suplee', 'even', 'Paul', 'Le', 'Mat', 'American', 'Graffiti']",N/A

Edward Norton plays the part of Derek Vinyard, who is an intelligent young man who falls into the skinhead neo Nazi lifestyle in Venice Beach, California. Stacey Keach plays Cameron Alexander, a white supremacist based on Tom Metzger, and Avery Brooks plays Dr. Bob Sweeney, a black high school teacher who reaches out to his students, both Black and White, to try to get them to turn away from gangs, hatred, and violence.Edward Furlong plays Daniel Vinyard, the younger brother of Derek, who also gets involved in the neo Nazi skinhead lifestyle once his brother Derek is sent to prison. Derek shoots and murders some Black car jackers who are stealing his truck, but goes over the line in his zealotry, and is sent to prison. While in prison, he rejects racism, and when he gets out, he tries to prevent his younger brother Danny from making the same mistakes as he. But it is not that easy, it is not like a Country Club that you can just quit and walk away from.Finally, director Tony Kaye wanted his name removed and sued the film company for damages. Edward Norton edited the film, and gave himself a bigger role, according to Kaye, and they fell out over artistic differences. I think that the final product was very good, and I don't see why Tony Kaye didn't want to be associated with it. The film I saw was well directed and covered a very controversial subject remarkably well. I guess it is just that the subject creates very strong feelings, and it is difficult to come to an agreement about how best to convey the proper politically correct line. It was almost one of those ""directed by Alan Smithee' situations, but one of the stipulations of using that pseudonym is that you don't discuss your dissatisfaction with the project in public, and Tony Kaye had already taken out ads in Variety that aired his dirty laundry and complaints.FILMS AND ROLES OF EDWARD NORTONFrida(2002) ....

Edward Norton stars as good kid turned homicidal neo-nazi, Derek Vinyard.  Vinyard is sent up after capping some Crips he catches trying to jack his car, but he returns to his old hood three years later on a mission from God.  This odd metamorphosis is effected through his friendship with a mysterious prisoner of color; and by his loathsome skinhead cellmates, who bum him in the shower for being friendly with a black man.  Although the story has holes in it big enough to drive a panzer through the movie held my interest.  Special mention should be made about the excellent acting of all those involved, especially Edward Norton, who somehow makes Vinyard's transformation from psycho killer to penitent believable.  In my opinion, Norton's presence in any movie is enough to raise it a star or two.  Less satisfying were the somewhat lifeless cinematography and the sometimes hammy dialogue.

American History X is the story of skinhead leader Derek Vinyard who is sent to prison for a racially motivated double homicide. During his stay in prison he has realizes the pointlessness of his racial hatred and belief system. When released he breaks with his virulent nazi past and attempts to extricate his younger brother from the mental clutches of racist philosophy/culture. The tale is stylishly shot and edited, perhaps too stylishly in its use of slow motion, lengthy black and white flashback scenes and dramatic musical score. A simpler approach would have helped the movie's sense of gritty reality and upped the emotional ante. The Hollywood production gloss can sometimes get in the way. Unfortunately its not just the production that is overdone. The film is often crudely melodramatic, and ham fisted when driving home its point. What is it's point? Well, American History X doesn't explore the origins of racism so much as it explores the pathology of racism, how it grows and spreads. It makes the assumption that racism is a learned behavior based in anger and then asks the question if racism is a learned behavior, could it then be unlearned? Which is an interesting point, but American History X's conclusions/assumptions are often too Hollywood pat and simplistic. The transformation of the central character from neo-nazi to moral thinking man is pivotal to the plot, but the circumstances surrounding his transformation are just not that believable, nor is his complete break with racism. Derek became a racist organizer in reponse to his bigoted fireman father's murder in a poor black neighborhood while fighting a fire. Which almost absolves him of some of the responsibiliy for his views. His anger at the death of his father is understandable even if his philosophy and subsequent actions are not forgivable. But Derek's allegiance to racial ideas is tenuous and more a reaction to the grief and anger he feels over his father's death and he's a VERY angry guy. The ultimate message the film seems to convey is not nescessarily that racism can be unlearned but that hatred is just too much work. If you choose to live with hatred and carry that baggage around, you and your loved ones will be affected by that hatred as evidenced by the violent and somewhat predictable end of the movie. As the Avery Brooks character asks Derek in prison: Has anything you've done in you life actually made it better? In Derek's case the answer is an obvious no. The seed of racism planted by his father and nurtured by Derek's hatred results in tragedy. Ultimately though the film is a bit too Hollywood and heavy handed, chosing to reach for easy emotional thrills, simple answers and consequences rather than to more fully explore its dark and complex subject matter. The movie can be at times VERY powerful, but true redemption is hard to come by.",3,An interesting if flawed tale of redemption,1147824000,"05 17, 2006",2006,3007,"['Racism', 'racist', 'violence', 'rarely', 'been', 'portrayed', 'ugly', 'stupid', 'kudos', 'filmakers', 'deglamorizing', 'racialist', 'culture', 'American', 'History', 'X', 'story', 'skinhead', 'leader', 'Derek', 'Vinyard', 'who', 'sent', 'prison', 'racially', 'motivated', 'double', 'homicide', 'stay', 'prison', 'pointlessness', 'racial', 'hatred', 'belief', 'system', 'When', 'released', 'virulent', 'nazi', 'past', 'attempts', 'extricate', 'younger', 'brother', 'mental', 'clutches', 'racist', 'philosophy/culture', 'tale', 'stylishly', 'shot', 'edited', 'perhaps', 'too', 'stylishly', 'use', 'slow', 'motion', 'lengthy', 'black', 'white', 'flashback', 'scenes', 'dramatic', 'musical', 'score', 'simpler', 'approach', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'movie', 'sense', 'gritty', 'reality', 'upped', 'emotional', 'ante', 'Hollywood', 'production', 'gloss', 'can', 'sometimes', 'get', 'way', 'Unfortunately', 'not', 'just', 'production', 'overdone', 'film', 'often', 'crudely', 'melodramatic', 'ham', 'fisted', 'when', 'driving', 'home', 'point', 'What', 'point', 'Well', 'American', 'History', 'X', ""n't"", 'explore', 'origins', 'racism', 'so', 'much', 'pathology', 'racism', 'how', 'spreads', 'assumption', 'racism', 'learned', 'behavior', 'based', 'anger', 'then', 'question', 'racism', 'learned', 'behavior', 'could', 'then', 'be', 'unlearned', 'Which', 'interesting', 'point', 'American', 'History', 'X', 'conclusions/assumptions', 'are', 'often', 'too', 'Hollywood', 'pat', 'simplistic', 'transformation', 'central', 'character', 'neo-nazi', 'moral', 'thinking', 'man', 'pivotal', 'plot', 'circumstances', 'surrounding', 'transformation', 'are', 'just', 'not', 'believable', 'complete', 'break', 'racism', 'Derek', 'became', 'racist', 'organizer', 'reponse', 'bigoted', 'fireman', 'father', 'murder', 'poor', 'black', 'neighborhood', 'fighting', 'fire', 'Which', 'almost', 'responsibiliy', 'views', 'anger', 'death', 'father', 'understandable', 'even', 'philosophy', 'subsequent', 'actions', 'are', 'not', 'forgivable', 'Derek', 'allegiance', 'racial', 'ideas', 'tenuous', 'more', 'reaction', 'grief', 'anger', 'father', 'death', 'VERY', 'angry', 'guy', 'ultimate', 'message', 'film', 'convey', 'not', 'nescessarily', 'racism', 'can', 'be', 'unlearned', 'hatred', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'work', 'choose', 'live', 'hatred', 'carry', 'baggage', 'around', 'loved', 'ones', 'will', 'be', 'affected', 'hatred', 'evidenced', 'violent', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'end', 'movie', 'Avery', 'Brooks', 'character', 'Derek', 'prison', 'Has', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'done', 'life', 'actually', 'made', 'better', 'Derek', 'case', 'answer', 'obvious', 'seed', 'racism', 'planted', 'father', 'nurtured', 'Derek', 'hatred', 'results', 'tragedy', 'Ultimately', 'film', 'bit', 'too', 'Hollywood', 'heavy', 'handed', 'chosing', 'reach', 'easy', 'emotional', 'thrills', 'simple', 'answers', 'consequences', 'rather', 'more', 'fully', 'explore', 'dark', 'complex', 'subject', 'matter', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'times', 'VERY', 'powerful', 'true', 'redemption', 'hard', 'come']",N/A

Both are restless white skinheads who are part of a neo-nazi skinhead gang. The plot unravels Derricks penchant for leadership while Daniel looks up to him in awe. Filmed in both colour and black and white, this is very powerful film-making backed up by powerful performances.Much of the story holds a message, which is one that I'll leave for you to find out yourselves. It looks at racism, both from whites and blacks. It looks at those who look past the colour of someone's skin or hold no grudge for prejudice that another man holds. It looks at family and role models. It looks at the unnecessary anger that a whole generation of people can have.This is a powerful and impressing film that everyone should see.",5,One of the finest films Ihave seen in some time,1048032000,"03 19, 2003",2003,1169,"['are', 'very', 'few', 'films', 'truly', 'came', 'away', 'stunned', 'Fight', 'Club', 'was', 'one', 'English', 'Patient', 'was', 'Films', 'pushed', 'boundaries', 'did', 'things', 'differently', 'refused', 'conform', 'cliched', 'predictable', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'Films', 'lean', 'away', 'mere', 'entertainment', 'more', 'towards', 'art', 'doubt', 'American', 'History', 'X', 'one', 'films.The', 'storyline', 'Daniel', 'Edward', 'Furlong', 'older', 'brother', 'Derrick', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'are', 'restless', 'white', 'skinheads', 'who', 'are', 'part', 'neo-nazi', 'skinhead', 'gang', 'plot', 'unravels', 'Derricks', 'penchant', 'leadership', 'Daniel', 'up', 'awe', 'Filmed', 'colour', 'black', 'white', 'very', 'powerful', 'film-making', 'backed', 'up', 'powerful', 'performances.Much', 'story', 'message', 'one', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'find', 'out', 'yourselves', 'racism', 'whites', 'blacks', 'who', 'look', 'colour', 'someone', 'skin', 'hold', 'grudge', 'prejudice', 'man', 'family', 'role', 'models', 'unnecessary', 'anger', 'whole', 'generation', 'people', 'can', 'have.This', 'powerful', 'impressing', 'film', 'everyone', 'should', 'see']",N/A

I'll explain in a minute, first let's give a small summary.Edward Norton plays Derek Vinyard, basically a co-leader of a growing and violent white supremacy group, until he lands in jail for manslaughter, and comes out a changed man.  Meanwhile, his little brother, Danny Vinyard, played excellently by Edward Furlong, is adapting his brother's ways since held him on a pedestal, and is moving down the same path.  Enriched by black and white flashbacks, and incredible emotion and superior acting by the main characters, and its supporting cast (Fairuza Balk, Ethan Suplee, Beverly D'Angelo, and Elliott Gould), AHX is a movie I'll always remember and love.The acting in this movie surely makes it great.  All the characters are quite believable in their roles, and they make those roles come alive.  Edward Norton's portrayal of Derek is one of the best performances I've ever seen.  But the whole movie is about deception, power, anger, and redemption, all four on high.  Furlong, Balk, and Suplee give performances of a lifetime as well.I don't recommend this to anyone under 13, basically for its graphic violence, but I consider it necessary for a teenager to watch and learn from.  There are a lot of lessons embedded within this film, and despite the very strong language and very mature situations, I recommend this to parents and teenagers over the age of 13.  Watch this and be mesmerized by memorable performances, and highly emotional scenes.  There is a certain graphic realism, and it shouldn't be overlooked.

Middleton,"[8, 11]","The fear of foreign races or people, and it evolving into an actual phobia, an intense and irrational dread, in other terms, racism, has been around since primitive man began forming tribes, millions of years ago. American History X examines racism in the context of present day neo-Nazism, and similar to the German Nazis of the 30's and 40's all foreigners are blamed for everything wrong with the State. The solution to unemployment, a high cost of living, rocketing welfare and rising crime is to jettison all immigrants, foreigners, from the country so that the original people, the white's in America or the Aryan race in 30's Germany can flourish as they are truly destined to do. This notion is one of the foundational tenets of fascism, and added to this, violence and war is the only method to achieve a `pure' flourishing State.American History X is a strong film presenting the arguments for the Right and the Left where, for the most part, the propositions on both sides have valid points, however, it is impossible to argue a subject as complex as immigration, rising crime and the cost of living by blaming these situations on a particular race of people. In fact, the argument is absurd because there are always exceptions, and as this important film points out with force and powerful emotion, racism is about hate, fear and personal anger, projected on a generality because it is convenient, a scapegoat for a lack of control and responsibility.Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) is an intelligent young man but somewhere along the line began to hate Black American's, Asian American's et al, and under the tutelage of an older and influential White Supremist, (Stacy Keach), becomes the leader of a `skinhead' gang in Venice Beach, trashing foreign owned grocery stores to finally be jailed for the brutal murder of two teenaged Black Americans because they attempted to steal his car. Derek is strong, passionate, and terribly angry and now, a cold blooded killer and his younger brother, Danny, (Edward Furlong) idolises him.Edward Furlong as Danny was perfect casting as he has a sensitive and forlorn, lost gaze, almost innocent because he loves his brother so much, and when his brother is released from prison with a different point of view, at first goes a little crazy, but will go along because he worships and loves him. Of course this makes the ending that much more forbidding and terribly moving. Furlong is a talented actor and is restrained in this picture, resulting in his performance being totally believable.A film about such a controversial subject matter cannot avoid presenting a message for the viewer. In the case of American History X, racism is not an innate condition but a learned one, passed on from generation to generation.American History X is not a good film but a truly great one and should be viewed by all concerned about our society and the hate and fear it contains...",5,XXXX...,1175558400,"04 3, 2007",2007,2920,"['fear', 'foreign', 'races', 'people', 'evolving', 'actual', 'phobia', 'intense', 'irrational', 'dread', 'other', 'terms', 'racism', 'been', 'primitive', 'man', 'began', 'forming', 'tribes', 'millions', 'years', 'ago', 'American', 'History', 'X', 'racism', 'context', 'present', 'day', 'neo-Nazism', 'similar', 'German', 'Nazis', '30', '40', 'foreigners', 'are', 'blamed', 'everything', 'wrong', 'State', 'solution', 'unemployment', 'high', 'cost', 'living', 'rocketing', 'welfare', 'rising', 'crime', 'jettison', 'immigrants', 'foreigners', 'country', 'so', 'original', 'people', 'white', 'America', 'Aryan', 'race', '30', 'Germany', 'can', 'flourish', 'are', 'truly', 'destined', 'do', 'notion', 'one', 'foundational', 'tenets', 'fascism', 'added', 'violence', 'war', 'only', 'method', 'achieve', 'pure', 'flourishing', 'State.American', 'History', 'X', 'strong', 'film', 'presenting', 'arguments', 'Right', 'Left', 'where', 'most', 'part', 'propositions', 'sides', 'have', 'valid', 'points', 'however', 'impossible', 'argue', 'subject', 'as', 'complex', 'immigration', 'rising', 'crime', 'cost', 'living', 'blaming', 'situations', 'particular', 'race', 'people', 'fact', 'argument', 'absurd', 'are', 'always', 'exceptions', 'important', 'film', 'points', 'out', 'force', 'powerful', 'emotion', 'racism', 'hate', 'fear', 'personal', 'anger', 'projected', 'generality', 'convenient', 'scapegoat', 'lack', 'control', 'responsibility.Derek', 'Vinyard', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'intelligent', 'young', 'man', 'somewhere', 'line', 'began', 'hate', 'Black', 'American', 'Asian', 'American', 'et', 'al', 'tutelage', 'older', 'influential', 'White', 'Supremist', 'Stacy', 'Keach', 'leader', 'skinhead', 'gang', 'Venice', 'Beach', 'trashing', 'foreign', 'owned', 'grocery', 'stores', 'finally', 'be', 'jailed', 'brutal', 'murder', 'two', 'teenaged', 'Black', 'Americans', 'attempted', 'steal', 'car', 'Derek', 'strong', 'passionate', 'terribly', 'angry', 'now', 'cold', 'blooded', 'killer', 'younger', 'brother', 'Danny', 'Edward', 'Furlong', 'him.Edward', 'Furlong', 'Danny', 'was', 'perfect', 'casting', 'sensitive', 'forlorn', 'lost', 'gaze', 'almost', 'innocent', 'brother', 'so', 'much', 'when', 'brother', 'released', 'prison', 'different', 'point', 'view', 'first', 'little', 'crazy', 'will', 'go', 'along', 'course', 'ending', 'much', 'more', 'forbidding', 'terribly', 'moving', 'Furlong', 'talented', 'actor', 'restrained', 'picture', 'resulting', 'performance', 'being', 'totally', 'believable.A', 'film', 'controversial', 'subject', 'matter', 'can', 'not', 'avoid', 'presenting', 'message', 'viewer', 'case', 'American', 'History', 'X', 'racism', 'not', 'innate', 'condition', 'learned', 'one', 'passed', 'generation', 'generation.American', 'History', 'X', 'not', 'good', 'film', 'truly', 'great', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'viewed', 'concerned', 'society', 'hate', 'fear']",N/A

33753,AAPA4KQWA7UXN,0780625129,cvairag,"[1, 4]","Vintage years for film seem to come in bunches - the late forties - the late nineties - being primary examples.  In the thick - when the critics become the most confused  - spoiled by the surfeit, we, the movie going masses seem to troop along.  Such a year for film was 1998-1999.  Most of us have had our differences with the judgments of The Academy of Arts and Sciences (if you're not smiling by now - don't read further).  But none of the Academy's many shameful blunders compare to what went down on Oscar night 1998.  Let me remind you.  The nominees for best picture: Shakespeare In Love (winner), Elizabeth, Life is Beautiful (Best Foreign Language Film winner), Saving Private Ryan, The Thin Red Line.  O.K.  I'll ask:  Would any of you today, in your right mind, claim that any of these films (every one of them set in Europe, by the way), with the possible exception of Saving Private Ryan, held a candle to that enduring masterpiece, in the opinion of so many here, and elsewhere, one of the greatest and most important and moving films ever made, American History X?Over time, the vox populi imparts justice of sorts.  These days, when I inquire of my 20-something students if any of them have seen Shakespeare In Love, maybe a hand goes up.  Perhaps, this handily-crafted piece of fluff (with its cavalier sense of history) made all the more delicious by the mellifluous, long-waisted presence of La Paltrow, goddess of the late dot com boom in the blush of young beauty, deserved a better fate.  Perhaps not.  Perhaps, the spectacle of Gwynnie dancing with Daddy (like Candy) at her Oscar coronation helped prepare T.V. audiences for the nepotistic profligacy of the coming Bush inauguration.  Perhaps, nothing could have prepared them.The response to American History X is, of course, quite different.  A decade later, an entirely new generation of viewers again experiences the intensity and passion of this magisterial cinematic statement and responds in kind.  My point is: there's no substitute for a film which has something crucial say and says it as well as it could be said.We all know how much inconsequential junk is passed of as cinema every year.  Like the audience, the film industry must eat to stay alive.  Clich&eacute;s, humorless as ever, abound.  Ask Bruce Willis to say something on film.  That's why I'm upset.  When a great script gets made into a masterpiece, in Hollywood no less, even the best tend to shun or worse, pan it.  Or misunderstand it. This film is about a lot more than misguided white racist supremacy. Please.  And Derek's rhetoric is not that logically powerful or convincing to be obsessed over, as many critics have, at the expense of all the many more important things this film says.Take the greatest screenwriting mentors: Robert McKee and Syd Field.  McKee's masterpiece, Story, may be best book ever written on dramatic writing (roll over Aristotle), or writing narrative, period.  Sine qua non for attempting to write for the cinema.  What is the favorite script of these genius pedagogues?  Chinatown.  No doubt a great script - the textbook exemplar.  And - in many senses a great film - made at a pivotal moment in the history of film - a moment it eulogized - the passing of film noir.  Yeah.  The ultimate corruption of the world, the masked and massive darkness we found our world on.  The perversity of power we enshrine in our struggle for survival. But to tell you truly, American History X (to my knowledge wholly ignored by both Field and McKee in their writings and seminars) is the greater script (for all the principles it betrays) and the greater film.  The proof is in the pudding: this film enunciates the essential conflict of our time, not another, or the fruit of that conflict, whichever way one wishes to see it.  And I would go further.

This film was reccomended to me, and I though it was a great film about what unreasoned, reckless hate does to a person, but one underlying theme continued to bug the heck out of me.First, the positives.  The stroy follows the family of a slain police officer.  They live in an area that is constantly being taken over by immagrants and gangs.  This is the platform for which Derick, the eldest brother of the family begins to form his neo-nazi ethics.  Derick is a bright, well spoken young man, and after his father is slain by black gangsters, he concentrates his energy upon forming a white, neo-nazi gang to counter the increasing black and immigrant gangs in the area.  When Derick's gang wins a basketball game, forcing a rival black gang from the local basketball courts, the black gangsters propose to get even by vandlizing Derick's late father's truck.  In the proposed defense of his family and property, Derick goes too far and is sentanced to prison.  While in prison, Derick begins to learn the flaws of his reasoning and the hipocracy of his Neo_Nazi gang's actions.  Meanwhile, Danny, Derick's younger brother, who practically worships Derick, continues down the dark path, making trouble at school (Writing paper on ""Mein Kumph"" for his class that has a back teacher).  Danny is enveloped by the very gang which Derick began.  When Derick is released from prison, it is up to Derick to streighten Danny out and try to set things right...but it has tragic consequences.Now for my major gripe.  What would have been an extrodinary film is ruined when the scriptwriters turn the film into an advertisement for the DNC / liberal left.  Just about every arguement brought up in this film is one of the mainstream (not racist) conservitive.  The answer to every arguement proposed, such is that if you want illeagle immagrents deported, if you are against affermitive action, if you think race has no matter or no excuse for crime, then you must be a racist neo nazi.  This is what the whacko leftist hollywoood idiots want you to think (as does the communist media).  In other words, if you felt guilty because you began to understand Derick's arguments, don't.  Neo-Nazis go far beyond (and a lot more irrationally) than points such as these.  This was just the insertion of the left's propiganda.In other words, this is a film would have come close to excellance, if it hadn't so ardently pushed an adjenda.

He should be so proud, but alas, if theres one thing that prison has tought him it's that he was there for a reason...he was wrong.  This film has so much heart and soul it's a shame that there are still those who don't see it for what it really is.  You have a man who knows only one way to feel, and due to experiences in his life he feels he is justified, and throughout the movie, while listening to Derrik rant and rave you will start to see where he's coming from.  It may be scary to admitt, but then again it's not when you see the life he lived and the adverse effects childhood trauma can have on someone, regardless of rights and wrongs.  It's like when a man, abused relentlessly by his father turns around and abuses another child.  There's no justifying the crime, it's WRONG, but you can start to break down the reason's as to why.  That's what this film does, it breaks down the reasons as to WHY there is so much hate today and why people feel the way they do.  The key to this film is that you can't blame the world for what one person has done...and you can't blame a race for the jack@$$ decitions of a few.  Derrik realizes this after spending his time in prison, realizing that there is good and bad in all races, even whites, and that you can't hold a nametag over the heads of every minority you see just because the ones you know are @$$holes...It's a timely lession because we all do it.  Stereotypes are so common that he blacks will make comments in regards to there own stereotypes and whites will do the same.  We all cast judgment because of a few instances and thus make it harder for each coming generation to make there own choice as to how to feel.  We are molding our youths to feel the hatred we keep inside by the comments we make under our breath or the jokes we make when in mixed company.  EVERYONE does it, but what this movie does so well at showing is the HORRID outcome that can happen if we don't learn as a society to accept one another.  We should not hate a race but hate an action.  Don't hate every african-american because the ones on your street seel crack and gang beat your brother...don't hate whites because your brother was harrased at school by the class racist...There is good in bad in every race, culture, religion...you name it it's there...but the bottom line is that with the bad there is the good and we as humans only have to dig so far before we find it.

Sanderman,"[3, 5]","From an incredibly unknown director, ""American History X"" is a powerful film that brings the audience face-to-face with white supremacy.  But this is not the easily dismissed, ignorant white supremacy that is represented in so many films these days.  Rather, it is white supremacy in the mind of an extremely intelligent young man played by Edward Norton.  While anyone with reasonable intelligence can see the holes in Derek Vinyard's logic, the arguments themselves are delivered with powerful and forceful eloquence that is absolutely shocking.  Norton's performance is riveting; I am constantly amazed at the depth of his acting ability.  One is able to go from hating him to being moved by him to absolutely routing for him-all in the same film.The movie is extremely graphic and moving.  ""American History X"" is not your typical film about racism and violence.  It manages to emerge from the rubble and provide a positive message for those of us who are left to deal with the world.  Hate is learned; one can see that in the lives of these two neo-Nazis.  But it can also be forgotten.  The most important thing, however, is to never learn to hate in the first place.  Not only does this film provide insight into the making of a racist, it empathizes with those who are unwittingly caught up in the false logic the white supremacists sell.  Many movies try to dismiss those who hate.  This film tries to understand where they are coming from and shows us how close we all are to crossing the line.

I sincerely think that the subject of AMERICAN HISTORY X is one of the most important matter to discuss nowadays. I cannot stand the arguments of any extremist political or social groups, leftist or  ultra-conservative. But we're here to give an opinion about a movie and not  to have a philosophical meeting about morals. So, in my humble opinion,  AMERICAN HISTORY X is a very poor movie with a great subject and  outstanding actors.The script of AMERICAN HISTORY X is a collection of  clich&eacute;s one can find in thousands of Hollywood movies since the thirties.  Just imagine, in the character played by Edward -DEREK- Norton, James  Cagney or Humphrey Bogart. After having spent three years in jail, Bogie  comes back home and realizes his younger brother has become a potential  public danger. With the help of his parole officer, he'll try to save him  from the streets.

While his character may look scary, it's the fact that he is almost plausible that makes him truly scary.The scene where his character Derek Vinyard self-destructs at the dinner table while arguing with his mothers new Jewish boyfriend is agonisingly painful. And yet Norton is such a good actor that he makes his point sound reasoned, and despite ourselves we can see some logic in his rationale. There is another infamous scene where he dispatches a black victim that literally made me wince with the sheer brutality of it.Ultimately, despite himself, Derek begins to realise that a life wasted on hatred is fruitless, and he attempts to redeem himself by saving his younger brother from following his bad example. The climax of the film provides a painful and poignant denouement, and unlike many films today, does not leave us with a neatly tied-up ending, but rather with tragedy and anguish.Not easy viewing, but worthy.

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[0, 1]","Edward Norton is a fabulous actor, yet his portrayal as an angry, hate-filled skinhead in AMERICAN HISTORY X may be his best, most powerful performance.  Norton so immerses himself in the role of a young man feeling disenfranchised from his culture and society that his racist rants take on a surreal logic all their own; one of the primary reasons this is such a disturbing film.The interracial interaction and tension is as volatile as it is believable, making the first half of the film extremely uncomfortable to watch.  Stacy Keach playing a cold, cunning, calculating mentor to the skinhead gang is extremely effective, and Edward Furlong is compelling as Norton's impressionable younger brother.  The brothers come from a highly dysfunctional family, matriarched by a frightened, unstable mother (Beverly D'Angelo).  Once Norton's character is sent to prison for gunning down two African Americans, AMERICAN HISTORY X takes a decided turn, as the protagonist experiences a reawakening--and a very ironic friendship.Upon his release our main character has a much different outlook on life, yet cannot turn his younger brother away from years of indoctrinated hate, and the film moves relentlessly toward its hopelessly tragic (and horrific) conclusion.  One does indeed reap what one sows--a powerful lesson to take from AMERICAN HISTORY X, a compelling, engrossing, yet disturbing film.--D.

You may need to keep one finger on the fast forward button during the Black & White flashbacks. Norton is at his best portraying three personas as the film masterfully transitions forward and backward in time among adolescent Derek, skinhead Derek, and mature Derek. Edward Furlong is superb as the impressionable younger brother and fair witness to events. A film about race relations and hate crimes could easily come across as preachy, this one does not.

Though he claims that Edward Norton edited the film to allot himself more screen time, most believe there is something deeper at work here.Equally as interesting: this film's script-ending is dramatically different from the end-product. To avoid spoilers, check the bottom of IMDB's trivia for this film for the shocking details!! (Though this conclusion is alluded to in the actual film-ending, it is made blatant in the script).If for some strange reason ""Fight Club,"" ""Red Dragon,"" ""Death to Smoochy,"" and ""Primal Fear"" did not convince you that Norton has TREMENDOUS range, this film will. Not only did Norton physically transform himself for this role by gaining THIRTY pounds of muscle, he mentally accessed the very dark place where hatred resides. His character is all-too-believable. A credit to his talent, indeed!!Those who find this film only reinforces stereotypes seem to miss how the film portrays the both the irrationality of racism and its insidious nature. This is especially evident in the character of Seth. That fact the Seth refuses to eat a black jellybean because of its color paints a pretty clear picture. On the other hand, the film does not hesitate to show the viewer that many members of hate groups are intellectually gifted: like Derek and Danny. Circumstance has pushed these young men to seek a new father figure, and they find comfort in the attention provided by Cameron (leader of the fictional D.O.C. or Disciples of Christ). Chilling!Several people here claim the black-and-white scenes are ""artsy."" Entirely untrue. They have a very clear purpose: they exist simply to indicate ""the past."" (It is a common film-device. . . as nearly all of you reading this know). In no way does this detract from the film. In fact, it makes several graphic scenes more tolerable.If you are interested in film art, keep an eye on the use of the sea ... and pay specific attention to the diner-scene (near the conclusion) where Norton stands in front of a sea-scape painting . . . his head engulfed in the waves. That which was once so alive becomes frozen in time. (Read into it what you will!)Though there are some sexually explicit scenes, it is a great film for a college classroom or for a very mature teenager (though, if I were a parent, I would not want to watch it WITH my child). Some see the work as heavy-handed . . . I think it is quite real.A must-see for any Norton fan or anyone interested in human-behavior.Suggested Reading: Roth, Luanne.

Told through the eyes of Derek's younger brother Danny, superbly portrayed by Edward Furlong, this is the story of a family torn apart after the loss of their firefighter father, killed whilst working in a black neighbourhood. As a result, the highly intelligent Derek (Norton), already influenced by his late father's bigotry and manipulated by cowardly fascist Cameron Alexander (Stacy Keach) becomes the charismatic leader of a local gang of skinheads. This inevitably leads to friction within Derek's family and his imprisonment for the murder of two black youths. Whilst in prison hero-worshipping Danny (Furlong) seeks to emulate his older brother and becomes more and more involved with the white power movement and influenced by Cameron (Keach) and his mindless morons. However, with a hero's welcome being planned for Derek's release from prison, he returns to his neighbourhood a changed man and sets out to repair the damage he's done to his family and to persuade his brother not to travel the same road.Brilliantly written by David Mc.Kenna and with top-notch performances from both its male leads (ably supported by Avery Brooks and Stacy Keach) American History X is an intelligent and powerful examination of the causes and existence of racial bigotry and hatred. It does not seek to sensationalise rascism or violence but neither does it duck the issues. Controversial because of its frank portrayal of rascists as human beings, the scariest part of watching American History X is how credible and believable Edward Norton's rascists arguments (as the charismatic leader Derek Vinyard) can be and how easy it must be for impressionable youth to be drawn into a world of hatred and violence. This is as much education as entertainment and essential viewing for fans of intelligent drama.

Where should I start with the complaints, ah yes.  The liberal bias in Hollywood is present, and you want prove watch this.  It seems that you are either a liberal(the good guys) or a conservative homophoic racist fascist bigot.  There is no in-between, its just that easy.  The dinner table scene with Elliot Gould is the best example.  While Edward Norton is spewing his hate filled diatribes, the only opposition to his speech is a pretty left-wing point of view.  If a conservative was sitting at the table, I think he would be just as outraged at the language Norton uses, but no we can't add even a little bit of debate into this.  Its the liberal way or the fascist way.  Well, now that I'm done with that, I'll get to the plot.  Ultimately, its a little predictable and overwrought.

American History X tells an all-too-real story about modern issues such as racism, affirmative action, and white supremacy. This movie really makes you think about these issues, and for that, along with the fine acting of the cast (especially Ed Norton), this movie is outstanding (a word I seldom use).The movie deals with Derek Vinyard (Norton), an intelligent, charismatic, and well-spoken neo-nazi skinhead, who was driven to racism after the murder of his father. Vinyard has just been released from prison, and is trying to sever ties with his racist past, and also trying to convince his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) not to follow in those footsteps, as he is starting to do.The flashback scenes (including the now-infamous scene involving the curb) are very well-done. In black and white, they actually play out like Danny Vinyard's bad memories.Another interesting point is how well-spoken and articulate Derek is. He actually does bring up good points about Rodney King, and illegal immigration in America. (I am not racist, and do not condone neo-nazism in any way, but I do agree with him on these issues.)In short, this film is a must-see.

This is about  to prove my points.  Firstly, it is essential from the start you know who  it is who is narrating the piece, as this got me confused to begin with, i  caught on at the end of the film, so i had to watch it again in a different  perplexion.  Derek (Nortan) is out for revenge on the race that murdered  his father, so he stops at nothing with this in mind.  So much so that he  leads a white power movement.  Despite his wisdom, a flash of anger  overppowers him for say 5 minutes leading to the brutal murder of 3 people,  and this lands him in Jail, where his whole vision changes, and when he is  released, he becomes ashamed of his past, and he tries to rectify this.  Okay theres the 'blurb', but my point lies with the fact that this movie is  very graphic, and a bit on the racist side, so i would say watch it by  yourself first, so you dont get embarresed when watching it with friends.

33791,A84UFSF2SZS2W,0780625129,"EriKa ""E""","[1, 1]","Not long ago I told a friend to see this disturbing but well made film, and he said, ""I think I should watch the first nine parts first."" This is what happens when your communications are reduced to computers. If I were talking to him verbally I could say, ""American History ex..."" but written it looks like American History 10. So be it. We eventually straightened it out. It is just one great film, not a ten part documentary series by Ken Burns. This film may touch you on many levels. It will make you examine your own feelings on race. It may make you confront the idea that has been put forth that we are all racists on some level. Naturally we don't take our racial feelings to extremes like the characters in this film do, but on some level we can see and understand and trace the roots of where our racial feelings come from. When I was a baby I played with a little neighbour girl who was black. We were not even a year old, and we obviously did not care what colour we were. And we did not care about this until we got older and had ideas put into our heads by our families, our surroundings, our environment and our experiences. We might think we do not care, but we do. In the film, Derek (a shocking and excellent Edward Norton) goes to prison for murdering two black boys who have come to his house and attempted to steal his truck. Derek is a violently racist, white supremacist who has tattoos of swastikas and ""white power"" emblazoned all over his body. The film, through the eyes of Derek's younger brother (played by Edward Furlong), illustrates not just racism but how that racism began (with their late father's tirade on the evils of affirmative action and against reading black literature in school, and of course with their father-who was a police officer-losing his life in the line of duty). All of these events and others shaped who Derek grew up to be. Naturally he resented and hated someone for taking his father from him, and all the evidence in his mind pointed to ""otherness""... to blacks, to Jews, to anyone he could think in his pain and bitterness to blame. The turning point of the film comes when Derek murders the two black kids in the street in front of his house. The terrifying look on his face as he stands in the middle of the road and surrenders to the police is startling (who would have thought Edward Norton capable of that? Well, I suppose if you saw Primal Fear you know he is a superb actor). Derek goes to prison (prison scenes are filmed in black and white for a contrast) and starts to see things from a totally different angle and he comes out of prison a changed man, but by then his prior actions have changed the lives of his entire family and most of all for his younger brother whom he tries to save from having the same fate as he did. All the actors here are excellent, Norton being the most brilliant, to Beverly D'Angelo and the scary Fairuza Balk as Derek's psycho girlfriend Stacy. The ending is not at all happy, but it is about what you would expect from such an unforgiving and real look at unhappy circumstances and ills of society.",4,ILLS OF SOCIETY,992131200,"06 10, 2001",2001,3103,"['Not', 'long', 'ago', 'told', 'friend', 'see', 'disturbing', 'well', 'made', 'film', 'said', 'think', 'should', 'watch', 'first', 'nine', 'parts', 'first', 'what', 'when', 'communications', 'are', 'reduced', 'computers', 'were', 'talking', 'verbally', 'could', 'say', 'American', 'History', 'ex', 'written', 'American', 'History', '10', 'So', 'be', 'eventually', 'straightened', 'out', 'just', 'one', 'great', 'film', 'not', 'ten', 'part', 'documentary', 'series', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'film', 'may', 'touch', 'many', 'levels', 'will', 'make', 'examine', 'own', 'feelings', 'race', 'may', 'make', 'confront', 'idea', 'been', 'put', 'forth', 'are', 'racists', 'level', 'Naturally', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'racial', 'feelings', 'extremes', 'characters', 'film', 'do', 'level', 'can', 'see', 'understand', 'trace', 'roots', 'where', 'racial', 'feelings', 'come', 'When', 'was', 'baby', 'played', 'little', 'neighbour', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'black', 'were', 'not', 'even', 'year', 'old', 'obviously', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'what', 'colour', 'were', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'got', 'older', 'had', 'ideas', 'put', 'heads', 'families', 'surroundings', 'environment', 'experiences', 'might', 'think', 'do', 'not', 'care', 'do', 'film', 'Derek', 'shocking', 'excellent', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'prison', 'murdering', 'two', 'black', 'boys', 'who', 'have', 'come', 'house', 'attempted', 'steal', 'truck', 'Derek', 'violently', 'racist', 'white', 'supremacist', 'who', 'tattoos', 'swastikas', 'white', 'power', 'emblazoned', 'body', 'film', 'eyes', 'Derek', 'younger', 'brother', 'played', 'Edward', 'Furlong', 'not', 'just', 'racism', 'how', 'racism', 'began', 'late', 'father', 'tirade', 'evils', 'affirmative', 'action', 'reading', 'black', 'literature', 'school', 'course', 'father-who', 'was', 'police', 'officer-losing', 'life', 'line', 'duty', 'events', 'others', 'shaped', 'who', 'Derek', 'grew', 'up', 'be', 'Naturally', 'resented', 'hated', 'someone', 'taking', 'father', 'evidence', 'mind', 'pointed', 'otherness', 'blacks', 'Jews', 'anyone', 'could', 'think', 'pain', 'bitterness', 'blame', 'turning', 'point', 'film', 'when', 'Derek', 'two', 'black', 'kids', 'street', 'front', 'house', 'terrifying', 'look', 'face', 'middle', 'road', 'surrenders', 'police', 'startling', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'capable', 'Well', 'suppose', 'saw', 'Primal', 'Fear', 'know', 'superb', 'actor', 'Derek', 'prison', 'prison', 'scenes', 'are', 'filmed', 'black', 'white', 'contrast', 'see', 'things', 'totally', 'different', 'angle', 'prison', 'changed', 'man', 'then', 'prior', 'actions', 'have', 'changed', 'lives', 'entire', 'family', 'most', 'younger', 'brother', 'whom', 'save', 'having', 'same', 'fate', 'did', 'actors', 'here', 'are', 'excellent', 'Norton', 'being', 'most', 'brilliant', 'Beverly', ""D'Angelo"", 'scary', 'Fairuza', 'Balk', 'Derek', 'psycho', 'girlfriend', 'Stacy', 'ending', 'not', 'happy', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'such', 'unforgiving', 'real', 'look', 'unhappy', 'circumstances', 'ills', 'society']",N/A

Here in California we are the eighth largest economy in the world and we have been embracing multicultaralism for a long, long time.  I personally know for a fact that any good things about it, are heavily outweighed by the bad things.  It is fun to get to know other cultures, and one grows and learns a lot about themselves in the process, but it comes at a terrible price.  Multiculturalism is a looting of culture and tradition.  It is also the means to lower a people from prosperous, down into the ranks of the nothingness pool of poverty and enslavement.  Think that I'm just bigoted and don't know what I'm talking about?  I would've said the same thing to me a few years back, as I was also heavily indoctrinated by the media, believing that to roll out the red carpet to all peoples from all lands was an enlightened, peaceful position to be at.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Realize that you are not to blame if other countries have become rotten from the inside out.  Drop your guilt trip.American History X is a good movie, I highly doubt there is anyone disputing that.  Back in the mid-90s when I was attending the College of San Mateo, we watched it in my 3rd World Cinema class (a controversial class taught by a very opinionated black panther, and where my self-hatred really took hold).  It's a great movie to watch if you want to have a debate about racial issues afterwords.  But the scales are tipped in favor of non-white races in the movie.  If you can't immediately see that then just pay attention to the opinions in your debate, almost everyone will be defending every race but the white race after the movie.  It has always been one of my favorite movies, but now that I am learning to actually like my own people again, I see it for what it is, yet another brilliant propaganda piece made by Holly Wood, which is in fact an elitist magical world wanded by people who are not of my race, and who are famous for hating my race.  Disinformation is a lie sandwich, it will have good truth on the outer layers but a bad lie sandwiched in the middle.  This movie is no different.........The good message: You cannot judge a whole race badly based on the actions of a few bad eggs within it.  Every tree has it's good apples and it's rotten apples.

33800,AGMI06Z7JDCL6,0780625129,GeneH,"[2, 5]","I gave my review this title because in a lot of ways Ed Norton brings some of himself to this film and to ""Fight Club"".  There is a similar urban grit and undertone of dispair to both films.  Ed does a good job of being a thug, albiet a somewhat less convincing job of being a convict. In jail he did not harden, in fact he grew complacent.There were some wonderful moments in this movie, such as when the Principal described the lesser Vinyard as ""misguided"" and sets out to straighten him out by taking a personal interest in him. In doing so he demonstrates that education and experience are the best antidotes to self imposed stupidity.The gun play (especially the ""gangsta"" poses"") was irritating and at the same time ironic given which neo-nazis were using them. The undertone of Political Correctness was, as always, irritating and unnecessary.  I was pleased to note that the Principal dismissed one teacher's concerns about ""hate"" while at the same time addressing them head on.The Neo-Nazis were and are thier own best spokespersons.  Where they fall short is confusing race with culture, ideology and belief systems. They'd would probably be amazed at how much they have in common with conservative persons of color, who also hate crime and self destructive behavior.  Neo-Nazis also fail to recognize just how alien Nazi Germany was to the America that they claim to defend. The idea of ""volk"" is not American and I'm not even sure it's really German, given the self identity of provinces in Germany and German speaking nations.None the less there is something that suggests that our modern era's penchant for class identity and community must surely be creating pressures for whites to band together. Perhaps if we thought of ourselves more as ""I"" and not as ""we"" there might be less reason for hate groups?This movie isn't bad, but I did not assign it a high rating because of the heavy use of cliches and stereotypes - on both sides.  I think as a morality play it might have been improved by more attention to people and less attention to ideology.

Ed Norton received a well-deserved Best Actor Oscar Nomination this year for the lead role of Derek. The supporting cast includes Edward Furlong, Stacey Keach, and Avery Brooks.  They carry their weight as the story unfolds.The story is primarily told through the eyes of Derek's younger brother Danny, played by Edward Furlong. At the beginning of the story Danny is in trouble yet again for writing a paper on that most misunderstood figure, Adolph Hitler. Danny is an up and coming member of the Skin-Head gang located in that area of California. Avery Brooks, appearing as Danny's principal, doesn't want to give up on the promises he sees in Danny. Instead of throwing him out, he assigns another paper to be written. This is to be on Danny's older brother, Derek, who was just released from prison that morning. Derek was the head of the Skin-Head gang that Danny is currently running with. The rest of the movie flashes back and forth from the past to the present. Through Danny's paper we see how Derek, a brilliant student, is turned into a bitter teen-ager that believes only through ""white-power"" will he get anywhere in life. We also see the tragic night that causes Derek to be justly imprisoned. In the present phase of the movie we encounter a Derek who has grown intellectually while in prison and will now do anything to get his brother out of the trap he allowed himself to be drawn into.Ed Norton is wonderful in this role. Those who have seen him in previous roles remember him to be a good actor but built on a rather slight frame. Here he has bulked himself up to be the ""Aryan Superman"" his character portrays. During the time frame of the movie he carries us convincingly on the journey from embitter teenager to enlightened young adult.Strong warning though. This movie well deserves it's R rating. The subject matter alone is disturbing enough. The story is also visually graphic with scenes of violence and rape. If you are prepared for something like this I highly recommend this movie.

Tony Kaye`s directional debut is a strong piece of filmmaking, a poignant urban drama about racism and the way youth deals with it.The plot focuses the relationship of Derek Vinyard (an excellent Edward Norton) and his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong, also well cast), who live in a Californian neighborhood. Derek and his friends have strong neo-nazi convictions, an ideology that they have chosen (or were just manipulated) while were dealing with the difficult task of growing up and its common alienating process.After Derek spends some time in prison, his views of society change and he becomes a more tolerant, reasonable person and struggles to get his brother away from some racist influences. Kaye knows how to deliver a gritty and realistic atmosphere, with an intriguing visual style and some tense and suspenseful moments.There are a couple of brutal, strong scenes here to enhance the violence and latent danger of extreme racist actions.

33808,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,0780625129,Gregor von Kallahann,"[5, 5]","It's probably not surprising that so young an actor as Edward Norton did not get an Oscar for his riveting performance in AMERICAN HISTORY X back in 1998.  Actors in the 20s, usually get passed over on the assumption that they've got plenty of time to prove themselves over the course of their careers.  (I believe Adrien Brody's recent win for THE PIANIST made him the youngest winner ever--and he was pushing 30 by that point.)  Of course, cinema historians may find Norton's loss to the now somewhat discredited Roberto Benigni particularly galling (at least give it to Nolte or McKellan who were also up for the award that year--but Benigni fever, however benign it was, was running rampant that year and dictated otherwise).Norton's performance, as is generally acknowledged, is a tour-de-force.  Aside from his age, the other thing that worked against him as far as recognition from the Academy goes was the disturbing nature of the film.  Many reviewers have noted that the very articulateness with which Norton's character Derek expounds his racist views is downright scary.  One cannot dismiss him--as one can with nearly all of his neo-Nazi colleagues--as a complete ignoramus.  Even the supposedly canny and diabolically charismatic group leader, Cameron (Stacy Keach) is pretty much a cypher.  At the very least, Keach needed more screen time to establish why he was able to exert such a hold over Venice Beach's alienated white youth.  Do such groups really rely on middle aged Nazi gurus for inspiration?The failure to develop Keach's character is only one of many dramatic flaws--many of which have been detailed by other reviewers below and elsewhere.  The relatively short term (three years) that Derek serves in prison seems unlikely.  His in-prison conversion, mainly through the influence of a black inmate who befriends, him is certainly plausible, but also a little cliched.  The outreach efforts of a former teacher, also African-American, rings a bit truer but is also a bit dramatically suspect.  Finally, one could argue that someone as intelligent as Derek would not be so quick to reveal his change of heart to potentially dangerous former colleagues without first having made some provisions for his family's and his own safety and security.In short, there are gaps in the plot that you could drive a semi through.  That does not make the film--and Norton's performance--anything less than gripping, however.  The film's ending, which some may find a bit heavy handed, at least serves to remind the viewer that neither Derek's moral transformation not that of his younger brother (which Derek has begun to help effect) can prevent tragedy.  It is a final, powerful reminder that the cycle of hate is nearly impossible to break.For those who might be doing some programming or who simply like to do their own in-house double bills, consider running this film along with Mathieu Kassovitz's equally hard hitting HATE (LA HAINE).",4,Hard Hitting,1096156800,"09 26, 2004",2004,2955,"['probably', 'not', 'surprising', 'so', 'young', 'actor', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'Oscar', 'riveting', 'performance', 'AMERICAN', 'HISTORY', 'X', 'back', '1998', 'Actors', '20s', 'usually', 'get', 'passed', 'assumption', ""'ve"", 'got', 'plenty', 'time', 'prove', 'course', 'careers', 'believe', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'recent', 'win', 'THE', 'PIANIST', 'made', 'youngest', 'winner', 'ever', 'was', 'pushing', '30', 'point', 'course', 'cinema', 'historians', 'may', 'find', 'Norton', 'loss', 'now', 'somewhat', 'discredited', 'Roberto', 'Benigni', 'particularly', 'galling', 'least', 'give', 'Nolte', 'McKellan', 'who', 'were', 'also', 'up', 'award', 'year', 'Benigni', 'fever', 'however', 'benign', 'was', 'was', 'running', 'rampant', 'year', 'dictated', 'otherwise', '.Norton', 'performance', 'generally', 'acknowledged', 'tour-de-force', 'age', 'other', 'thing', 'worked', 'as', 'far', 'recognition', 'Academy', 'was', 'disturbing', 'nature', 'film', 'Many', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'very', 'articulateness', 'Norton', 'character', 'Derek', 'racist', 'views', 'downright', 'scary', 'One', 'can', 'not', 'dismiss', 'one', 'can', 'nearly', 'neo-Nazi', 'colleagues', 'complete', 'ignoramus', 'Even', 'supposedly', 'canny', 'diabolically', 'charismatic', 'group', 'leader', 'Cameron', 'Stacy', 'Keach', 'pretty', 'much', 'cypher', 'very', 'least', 'Keach', 'needed', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'establish', 'why', 'was', 'able', 'exert', 'hold', 'Venice', 'Beach', 'alienated', 'white', 'youth', 'Do', 'such', 'groups', 'really', 'rely', 'middle', 'aged', 'Nazi', 'gurus', 'inspiration', 'failure', 'develop', 'Keach', 'character', 'only', 'one', 'many', 'dramatic', 'flaws', 'many', 'have', 'been', 'detailed', 'other', 'reviewers', 'elsewhere', 'relatively', 'short', 'term', 'three', 'years', 'Derek', 'prison', 'unlikely', 'in-prison', 'conversion', 'mainly', 'influence', 'black', 'inmate', 'who', 'certainly', 'plausible', 'also', 'little', 'cliched', 'outreach', 'efforts', 'former', 'teacher', 'also', 'African-American', 'bit', 'truer', 'also', 'bit', 'dramatically', 'suspect', 'Finally', 'one', 'could', 'argue', 'someone', 'as', 'intelligent', 'Derek', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'so', 'quick', 'reveal', 'change', 'heart', 'potentially', 'dangerous', 'former', 'colleagues', 'first', 'having', 'made', 'provisions', 'family', 'own', 'safety', 'security.In', 'short', 'are', 'gaps', 'plot', 'could', 'drive', 'semi', 'not', 'make', 'film', 'Norton', 'performance', 'anything', 'less', 'gripping', 'however', 'film', 'ending', 'may', 'find', 'bit', 'heavy', 'handed', 'least', 'serves', 'remind', 'viewer', 'Derek', 'moral', 'transformation', 'not', 'younger', 'brother', 'Derek', 'begun', 'help', 'effect', 'can', 'prevent', 'tragedy', 'final', 'powerful', 'reminder', 'cycle', 'hate', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'break.For', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'doing', 'programming', 'who', 'simply', 'do', 'own', 'in-house', 'double', 'bills', 'consider', 'running', 'film', 'Mathieu', 'Kassovitz', 'equally', 'hard', 'hitting', 'HATE', 'LA', 'HAINE']",N/A

The whole story of the movie takes place in about 24 hours but seems longer because Danny (Edward Furlong) is reflecting on how his brother's experiences has helped shape his own ideas and attitudes concerning contemporary america.  That is the gist of the film; an essay which Danny was forced to write in one night.  Alot of ground was covered in terms of how kids are shaped and molded by their parents attitudes and by their experiences.  Another reviewer said that the most un-racist person would rethink some of their views while watching the Rodney King argument scene.  The arguement was good in the sense that Derek (Ed Norton) seemed really convinced, but his arguements regarding the LAPD using &quot;text book&quot; procedures on Rodney king was very weak.  I'm very liberal and democratic, yet his arguement didn't make me rethink any of my views one bit.  Basically all he was doing is using the same old right-wing conservative ku klux rhetoric that has been going on since slavery.  Where does this rhetoric get him or anybody else?  The movie makes it clear that there are only two places for people who espouse the views expressed by Derek.The movie begins and ends with a beautiful sunset on an isolated beach.  The music really adds to the surrealness of these two scenes.  Perhaps the one part of the movie which &quot;takes the cake&quot; for me was when Derek walked into Danny's room and looked at the wall filled with nazi posters and then began to help his brother tear everything down without saying a word.

It was very disturbing and moving and is a masterpiece. The movie is excellent with powerful performances notably by Edward Norton. Where's his oscar? Why'd Roberto Benigni get it? Edward was robbed!The movie is very powerful and moving and has a very sad and tragic ending. The movie is so sad because it is depicting reality. The watcher sees these skinheads and how awful they are. But, then you think about some of Edward Norton's statements and how they're maybe true. This makes you think a lot. The movie is about the leader of the skinheads, Derek (Edward Norton) who is sent to jail for killing some black guys trying to steal his car. His brother Donny (Edward Furlong) is headed down the same path as Derek but once Derek is released, he is a changed man. He feels bad for what he has done and wants to change. But his brother is confused and the skinheads aern't happy with their ex leader. The movie is so powerful and moving and shows the remarquable transformation of a mean and angry man into a kind and caring man.This movie is one of my favorites ever and I recommend it to everyone.

33822,AW1493ZQTQ2ET,0780625129,Irfan A. Alvi,"[1, 1]","This is generally a very good movie which explores the issue of race relations, primarily revolving around the story of a neo-Nazi group in California.  The acting is good overall, the plot is gripping, many of the images are (appropriately) horrifying, and Ed Norton is impressively buff.The main point the movie illustrates is that, because reality is rich and complex, one can readily sift and bend the evidence in order to construct all sorts of ideologies, including generally racist and specifically neo-Nazi ideologies.  A person with a lot of brainpower, but lacking checks and balances, can do this fairly creatively and rigorously, and such a person possessed with rhetorical skill can sell the ideology to more credulous people, especially if they're at an impressionable age or if they're facing tough times and would like to shift blame away from themselves and toward others.  If you have any doubt about this, try the experiment of spending a few days forcefully arguing for an ideology which you abhor; you might be surprised by the extent to which you begin to convince even yourself!  A related point is that falling in the grip of an ideology fosters a tribal mindset, which can lead to conflict between cultures, nations, classes, religious groups, political parties, ""special interests,"" clans, gangs, and of course races (though race is more a cultural than biological concept).  Such conflict can escalate to perpetuated violence (""An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind"" - Gandhi).  Again, all of this is illustrated well by the movie.My one complaint is that the movie doesn't really show how the main neo-Nazi character breaks free of his ideology and, moreover, his younger brother breaks free almost literally overnight, which strikes me as fairly implausible.  Because of this flaw, and because the movie didn't really cover any new ground or offer new perspectives for me (I've thought about this stuff for nearly all of my life), I've deducted one star, but I can still recommend this movie to anyone interested in a vivid depiction of these issues.",4,"Very good, but no truly new perspectives",1275264000,"05 31, 2010",2010,2087,"['generally', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'issue', 'race', 'relations', 'primarily', 'revolving', 'story', 'neo-Nazi', 'group', 'California', 'acting', 'good', 'overall', 'plot', 'gripping', 'many', 'images', 'are', 'appropriately', 'horrifying', 'Ed', 'Norton', 'impressively', 'buff.The', 'main', 'point', 'movie', 'reality', 'rich', 'complex', 'one', 'can', 'readily', 'sift', 'bend', 'evidence', 'order', 'construct', 'sorts', 'ideologies', 'including', 'generally', 'racist', 'specifically', 'neo-Nazi', 'ideologies', 'person', 'lot', 'brainpower', 'lacking', 'checks', 'balances', 'can', 'do', 'fairly', 'creatively', 'rigorously', 'person', 'possessed', 'rhetorical', 'skill', 'can', 'sell', 'ideology', 'more', 'credulous', 'people', 'especially', ""'re"", 'impressionable', 'age', ""'re"", 'facing', 'tough', 'times', 'would', 'like', 'shift', 'blame', 'away', 'others', 'have', 'doubt', 'try', 'experiment', 'spending', 'few', 'days', 'forcefully', 'arguing', 'ideology', 'abhor', 'might', 'be', 'surprised', 'extent', 'begin', 'convince', 'even', 'related', 'point', 'falling', 'grip', 'ideology', 'tribal', 'mindset', 'can', 'lead', 'conflict', 'cultures', 'nations', 'classes', 'religious', 'groups', 'political', 'parties', 'special', 'interests', 'clans', 'gangs', 'course', 'races', 'race', 'more', 'cultural', 'biological', 'concept', 'Such', 'conflict', 'can', 'escalate', 'perpetuated', 'violence', 'eye', 'eye', 'whole', 'world', 'blind', 'Gandhi', 'Again', 'illustrated', 'well', 'movie.My', 'one', 'complaint', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'show', 'how', 'main', 'neo-Nazi', 'character', 'breaks', 'free', 'ideology', 'moreover', 'younger', 'brother', 'breaks', 'free', 'almost', 'literally', 'overnight', 'fairly', 'implausible', 'flaw', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'cover', 'new', 'ground', 'offer', 'new', 'perspectives', ""'ve"", 'thought', 'stuff', 'nearly', 'life', ""'ve"", 'deducted', 'one', 'star', 'can', 'still', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'interested', 'vivid', 'depiction', 'issues']",N/A

The movie itself is very powerful with a powerful message within the movie showing how a young boy growing up with certain feelings about society and the people within that society can change his life around.  Some of the scenes within this movie are very hard to watch because of the violence of the scenes, and the main character slow motion shots of him on the street with the black guys trying to rob from his truck stays with you for life, plus the look in his eyes no feeling no compassion.  Though it also shows that same main character how he was able to change once he got out of jail for his crime and try to live a better life and watch out for the family he loves.  It proves that we can do something wrong in our past and be able to forgive ourselves and go on the right path because like one of the ending lines in the movie the one playing the brother says ""What have I learn from all this, is that hate is baggage...""  I totally agree with that line in  the movie there is no room in this world for hate because it will consume you take over your body, mind, heart, and soul and destory you.

It is true there are some interesting scenes in the first four fifths of the film. But the last part, after the nocturnal confrontation of the two brothers around what happened to Derek in prison goes its own way and leads to a message that is absolute despair. ""What have I done?"" says Derek on the dead body of his brother. He has in fact done nothing at all but exploited a manipulative situation that was rotten from the start and made him the victim of bigotry. But Derek was redeemed in prison. His brother was redeemed by Derek's tale of what happened to him in prison and by the black principal of the school. The two white boys were redeemed.

The movie deals with the current part of the story in colour, while the back story explaining Norton's past is presented in stark black and white.  The viewer gets to see the language and violence of hate that spewed from Norton, and very little is held back.  It's disturbing to watch.  His ""conversion"" away from racism is not as explicitly presented, and I found it to be a weaker part of the story.  Considering the depths of his white supremacist beliefs, not enough detail and time is given to explaining why he turns around.  Norton is riveting in the central role, bringing an all-too convincing charisma to a character that at times repulses the viewer.  Furlong, usually a weak actor in my opinion, is stronger than I have seen him before.  The supporting cast are fine.  The black and white and colour cinematography are excellent and used to great effect.  I don't want to spend time analyzing the speeches given and the film's point of view, because at the end, regardless of where you stand politically, the message is pretty clear.  At times, it's not an easy to film to sit through, but I don't know if racism, a topic of many a film, has ever been presented in so direct and disturbing a way.",4,Disturbing,1038700800,"12 1, 2002",2002,1399,"['Edward', 'Norton', 'one', 'today', 'finest', 'actors', 'stars', 'former', 'white', 'supremacist', 'recently', 'released', 'prison', 'who', 'save', 'brother', 'Edward', 'Furlong', 'following', 'footsteps', 'movie', 'deals', 'current', 'part', 'story', 'colour', 'back', 'story', 'explaining', 'Norton', 'past', 'presented', 'stark', 'black', 'white', 'viewer', 'see', 'language', 'violence', 'hate', 'spewed', 'Norton', 'very', 'little', 'held', 'back', 'disturbing', 'watch', 'conversion', 'away', 'racism', 'not', 'as', 'explicitly', 'presented', 'found', 'be', 'weaker', 'part', 'story', 'Considering', 'depths', 'white', 'supremacist', 'beliefs', 'not', 'enough', 'detail', 'time', 'given', 'explaining', 'why', 'around', 'Norton', 'riveting', 'central', 'role', 'bringing', 'all-too', 'convincing', 'charisma', 'character', 'times', 'repulses', 'viewer', 'Furlong', 'usually', 'weak', 'actor', 'opinion', 'stronger', 'have', 'seen', 'before', 'supporting', 'cast', 'are', 'fine', 'black', 'white', 'colour', 'cinematography', 'are', 'excellent', 'used', 'great', 'effect', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spend', 'time', 'analyzing', 'speeches', 'given', 'film', 'point', 'view', 'end', 'regardless', 'where', 'stand', 'politically', 'message', 'pretty', 'clear', 'times', 'not', 'easy', 'film', 'sit', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'racism', 'topic', 'many', 'film', 'ever', 'been', 'presented', 'so', 'direct', 'disturbing', 'way']",N/A

However, the story does not make  the movie. The story is simple. The procedure is flawless. Everything in  this film connects so perfectly that it makes me wonder how it did not  achieve more critical appeal. From start to finish, there is neither a  wasted scene, nor poor portrayal of Kaye's idea. Everything fits as it  should. For starters, the movie opens and closes on a beach. Nothing is  unimportant. After close viewing, the first beach is in B&amp;W and the  same beach later is shown in vibrant color. All the while it is accompanied  by a beautiful score that not only shows the dark life of our hero, but  also the beauty of nature and life in essence. When you think about it,  black and white is so ironic for the memories of our pro-Caucasian,  anti-Negro neo-Nazi. That in itself seems to be hidden brilliance. The  dialog is realistic and never overacted. Ed Norton should havebeen  nominated for best actor for his role in this film. You can see all the  emotions of his character just by looking in his eyes. Edward Furlong  proves to us that he CAN act. Also, AHX has some of the best cinematography  that can be found in these days of flashy camera angles. The cinematography  actually makes sense in portraying the drama and seems necessary in all of  its usage. Where was the academy when this movie was up for nominations?  Apparently kissing up to big whigs like Cameron and Spielberg. Not that I  dislike them, they are just overrated. AMX is WAY underrated. By far one of  the best films of the year.

33832,A2OU415LB9I5J6,0780625129,Jason C. Wilkerson,"[1, 1]","I remember when I was a kid the most I knew of American History X was the curb stomping scene. I didn't know anything more about the movie, so prior to seeing the movie the message was obviously not being translated properly within the minds of my peers. Looking back, though, that was fine by me as I'm mulatto and the friends who introduced the stories of American History X to me were all white, meaning they didn't have any of the personal issues the film mainly referred to.Recently though, I mean within a week of writing this review I have a friend who told me that he would have loved this movie had it not been for the ending (he didn't quite say it that way, but the ending ruined it for him which is the same in my small little mind). I think this is largely due to the editing of the movie putting the focus in an area that kind of throws our reasoning of the movie slightly off.For those of you who may not have seen American History X here's a little break down of the plot: Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton), an open white supremacist, has been in prison for several years due to the voluntary manslaughter of a couple of black people who tried to carjack him. On the day of his release his brother Danny (Edward Furlong), after turning in an assignment advocating Hitler's Mein Kampf, is required to write a history paper based on Derek's experience.First, I would like to say that this film is brilliant. In its exploration of white supremacy it views all of our stereotyping as a gateway to more virulent hate. Despite it's, at times, extremely violent imagery, X is very much a call for reform in the way that we think of race and of each other as individuals. Many people will, and have, found this movie preachy, but in my opinion it's not as preachy as other race related movies that others have ""campaigned"" against that I have enjoyed (i.e. Crash).The ending is still quite a point of contention though, and with good reason. As I mentioned before, I think this owes a lot to the editing of this movie. Unfortunately, director Tony Kaye was unable to offer an edit of the movie that the studio was willing to work with, and other editors were brought in and Norton assisted with the editing. The result was an edit of the movie that was extremely Norton heavy, although the finished movie was still thoroughly enjoyable. That also meant the message of the movie was fairly diluted.Viewing the movie from my perspective, though, the story was actually speaking to everyone trying to reform Danny through Derek's story. Sure partially to the movie's detriment the story is overly focused on Derek, but Danny is our way into the story of the movie and he also represents the audience. He's exploring the story of his brother, as we are, because he needs to learn something from it. The whole reason for that exploration: to turn back before it's too late.It's easy to miss that point in the wake of the ending, but if you allow yourself to bypass the end, you'd realize that it really represents the seemingly never ending circulation of hate. Trying not to give away the ending, this is really what we see. Danny has given in to the story of Derek and has freed himself of the hate that once consumed him, but he passed it on to another person who willingly partakes of that hate. It's a cycle that we need to break, and that's really what the ending, including the ending Abraham Lincoln quote signifies.I highly recommend this movie. I know some people will find it contrived, and a little too on the nose, but I feel there is quite a bit of drama to offset the preachiness of this film. The only other issue that I had with this particular film concerns a score that over emphasizes moments of the movie as grandiose or too foreboding considering the more documentary like style of the shoot. Overall, though, I think it effectively evokes emotion while conveying a message to end the cycle of hate.4.5/5For more review check out: &lt;...>",4,American History X,1308441600,"06 19, 2011",2011,3960,"['remember', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'most', 'knew', 'American', 'History', 'X', 'was', 'curb', 'stomping', 'scene', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'more', 'movie', 'so', 'prior', 'seeing', 'movie', 'message', 'was', 'obviously', 'not', 'being', 'translated', 'properly', 'minds', 'peers', 'Looking', 'back', 'was', 'fine', ""'m"", 'mulatto', 'friends', 'who', 'introduced', 'stories', 'American', 'History', 'X', 'were', 'white', 'meaning', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'personal', 'issues', 'film', 'mainly', 'referred', 'to.Recently', 'mean', 'week', 'writing', 'review', 'have', 'friend', 'who', 'told', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'movie', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'ending', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'say', 'way', 'ending', 'ruined', 'same', 'small', 'little', 'mind', 'think', 'largely', 'due', 'editing', 'movie', 'putting', 'focus', 'area', 'kind', 'throws', 'reasoning', 'movie', 'slightly', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'seen', 'American', 'History', 'X', 'here', 'little', 'break', 'plot', 'Derek', 'Vinyard', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'open', 'white', 'supremacist', 'been', 'prison', 'several', 'years', 'due', 'voluntary', 'manslaughter', 'couple', 'black', 'people', 'who', 'tried', 'carjack', 'day', 'release', 'brother', 'Danny', 'Edward', 'Furlong', 'turning', 'assignment', 'advocating', 'Hitler', 'Mein', 'Kampf', 'required', 'write', 'history', 'paper', 'based', 'Derek', 'experience.First', 'would', 'like', 'say', 'film', 'brilliant', 'exploration', 'white', 'supremacy', 'stereotyping', 'gateway', 'more', 'virulent', 'hate', 'times', 'extremely', 'violent', 'imagery', 'X', 'very', 'much', 'call', 'reform', 'way', 'think', 'race', 'other', 'individuals', 'Many', 'people', 'will', 'have', 'found', 'movie', 'preachy', 'opinion', 'not', 'as', 'preachy', 'other', 'race', 'related', 'movies', 'others', 'have', 'campaigned', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'i.e', 'Crash', '.The', 'ending', 'still', 'quite', 'point', 'contention', 'good', 'reason', 'mentioned', 'think', 'lot', 'editing', 'movie', 'Unfortunately', 'director', 'Tony', 'Kaye', 'was', 'unable', 'offer', 'edit', 'movie', 'studio', 'was', 'willing', 'work', 'other', 'editors', 'were', 'brought', 'Norton', 'assisted', 'editing', 'result', 'was', 'edit', 'movie', 'was', 'extremely', 'Norton', 'heavy', 'finished', 'movie', 'was', 'still', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'also', 'meant', 'message', 'movie', 'was', 'fairly', 'diluted.Viewing', 'movie', 'perspective', 'though', 'story', 'was', 'actually', 'speaking', 'everyone', 'trying', 'reform', 'Danny', 'Derek', 'story', 'Sure', 'partially', 'movie', 'detriment', 'story', 'overly', 'focused', 'Derek', 'Danny', 'way', 'story', 'movie', 'also', 'audience', 'exploring', 'story', 'brother', 'are', 'learn', 'something', 'whole', 'reason', 'exploration', 'turn', 'back', 'too', 'late.It', 'easy', 'miss', 'point', 'wake', 'ending', 'allow', 'bypass', 'end', ""'d"", 'realize', 'really', 'seemingly', 'never', 'ending', 'circulation', 'hate', 'Trying', 'not', 'give', 'away', 'ending', 'really', 'what', 'see', 'Danny', 'given', 'story', 'Derek', 'freed', 'hate', 'once', 'consumed', 'passed', 'person', 'who', 'willingly', 'partakes', 'hate', 'cycle', 'need', 'break', 'really', 'what', 'ending', 'including', 'ending', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'quote', 'signifies.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'know', 'people', 'will', 'find', 'contrived', 'little', 'too', 'nose', 'feel', 'quite', 'bit', 'drama', 'offset', 'preachiness', 'film', 'only', 'other', 'issue', 'had', 'particular', 'film', 'concerns', 'score', 'moments', 'movie', 'grandiose', 'too', 'foreboding', 'considering', 'more', 'documentary', 'style', 'shoot', 'Overall', 'think', 'effectively', 'emotion', 'conveying', 'message', 'end', 'cycle', 'hate.4.5/5For', 'more', 'review', 'check', 'lt', '>']",N/A

After watching the movie I noticed the emphasis being placed on the white characters listing their racist feelings and why they felt the way they did. It continued on to show the main white character as changing his racist attitude after his experiences in prison and the actions he took to correct his behavior. The movie also displayed the anti-white racist behavior of the black gangsters but did not show why they were racist or what action they were going to take to correct their behavior. Those black anti-white racist gangsters needed as much counseling and help as the main white character (played by Ed Norton) did. It showed them armed with firearms attempting to steal Ed Norton's truck and also appeared as if they were going to break into his house and shoot him and his family. He shot them in self-defense, and even though he was overly aggressive in his actions, his actions were justified. The movie skirts over the anti-white racist behavior by the black gangsters as if to say their behavior was normal and acceptable, and their behavior is not acceptable. It is anti-white racist. They shoot and rob people. The movie made no mention of the police trying to take them down; it only mentioned a police effort to take down the skinheads. The movie did imply that the white gang was formed as a defensive measure against the black and other non-white gangs operating in the Venice Beach area. Another part of the movie showed Ed Norton having a very emotional discussion with Elliot Gould and his family members (Elliot Gould portrayed a teacher of Jewish origin who was dating Ed's mother). I listened to what Ed was saying in that conversation, and tend to agree with what much of what he said. It was a conservative view, but in the movie the conservative viewpoints are deliberately being directly associated with white neo-nazi racism, which is a deliberate liberal Hollywood attempt to bash and profile conservative views. There was a comment made by Elliot Gould's character that I didn't like either. During that heated conversation with Ed Norton's character, Elliot Gould made a comment that Jews have been persecuted for 5,000 years. That comment does not apply to either Elliot Gould or the character he is playing, because they are both doing quite well in American society as are many Jews doing quite well in American society today; they would not be able to do as well as they are doing if they were being persecuted. His persecution complex in the comment he made just doesn't cut it. Elliot Gould's character also didn't seem to have any problem with the anti-white black racist gangsters (like the three depicted in the movie who cowardly ganged up on the one white student in the high school bathroom).  Again, the anti-white black gangster behavior was not addressed in the movie. The movie was slanted to the left and was anti-conservative as well as anti-white. It was not unbiased, impartial, or with a balanced view. This is why I am giving it two stars.",2,The point of the movie was slanted.

But if you're a real movie afficianado, you'll find this flick's messages are so overt that it's almost hard to be entertained by the story.For a better discussion of racism in the US, check out Spike Lee's ""Bamboozled.""In any case, the PC messages in this movie will make it dated in a decade or so, when PC switches to some other causes, or people no longer understand late-90s morale qualities.  Hatred and racism will always be around to one degree or another, but the peculiarities of our times won't.Norton's switch from buff evil Nazi to equal equality commando was a bit quick.  It's not like he'd never seen blacks or minorities or known them growing up in Venice Beach, CA.  Then he gets to prison and just one guy turns him around?Overall, it's a pretty good movie showing why race hatred is stupid.  The biggest fault I have is them showing the brutality with which Norton defended his property as being a bad thing.  It's not!  You don't steal people's rides!  As a blue-collar guy, that pickup truck may be the only thing that gets him to work.  Work is the only thing that feeds his family.

33837,A2EBLL2OYEQJN9,0780625129,Jessica Lux,"[0, 1]","This is a powerful movie that deserves all the respect it has gained.  It does not present a simple tale of right vs. wrong, but rather puts you in the shoes of people to see how skinhead ideals (or any racist ideals) can take over, and become all-consuming, and shape your life forever.  It's not at all a preachy story of a changed man, rather it is an intense portrait of a family hit by race issues, and the stuggles of each family member to come to terms with reality and find their own personal belief system.The story is told in flashbacks--it opens with Edward Norton's skinhead character getting out of jail for killing a black man.  Slowly, we learn the backstory of how he got to be the skinhead leader he was, and what happend to him in prison to make him look at the world differently.  I had tears in my eyes during the prison flashback segments.The Norton character gives many eye-opening monologues on his skinhead ideals.  There's just enough truth in what he says to make him dangerous.  It's very easy to see how disaffected youth, bullied by gangs, could turn to the skinhead ideals as a safe haven.This is an amazing movie about racist ideals and family ties.

33838,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,0780625129,J from NY,"[0, 1]","I remember very clearly when ""American History X"" was all the rage, and every guy with a trench coat or a goatee thought it was the best movie ever made.  I never saw it because I hate self consciously politically correct films, as they tend to leave out some gray areas in reality.  I have to say, though, this is actually a pretty realistic film of what can transform an average, or intensely bright person from being disgruntled and alienated into full racist scumbag.  There are always predators that target young people, and Skinheadism/Nazism is a particularly predatory mold to cast one in.  They are in prison, on the street, and as in the film, they specialize in urban areas where tensions uniquely racial exist.Edward Norton plays Derek Vinyard, a young man with a father who was shot in an urban area while working in his capacity as a fireman, seemingly randomly.  This, along with a nasty comment he makes to his son about black literature, are the two fuses that blow his mind into a Reichstag firestorm of hatred.  What is so sad about this story is not only the diabolic path he chooses, but the waste of an obviously enormous intellect.  The predator, played despicably well by Stacy Keach, calls himself ""Cameron"" and just like a pedophile, he waits for white kids who feel pushed around by minorities to feel empowered with Nazi ideology.  For a time, Derek sees him as his surrogate father and is willing to do his bidding anywhere; pushing black guys around on the basketball court, giving Himmlerlike speeches about immigration worthy of Joe Arpaio himself, and finally murdering three black guys and executing one with the infamous ""curb stomp"".  This scene really is perfectly done and ambiguous; we see that the three men he kills all have guns and are a threat to his family, but this is not why he kills them, not really; he kills them because he wants to, badly, and does so with a fanatical zeal.His younger brother, Danny (Edward Furlong), is like a lukewarm version of his older brother but never as full of hate.  I disagree with viewers who see him as really on his older brother's path.  He's confused and in an environment that is so chaotic he cannot form an opinion for himself on anything.  What Derek is doing, without realizing it, is encouraging his brother to involve himself in situations he can't handle, one of which gets him killed.What happens to Derek in prison didn't seem quite true to life to me.  Anyone who has known a true skinhead or Neo Nazi is aware that they can encounter nice minorities anywhere and chat with them; but at the end of the day, the dogma usually sticks pretty well.  They have no desire for human interconnection, even if they know what they propose is BS.  And it happens so quick with Derek.Now, with the Stand your Ground laws (i.e. ""I Can Shoot Anyone If They Sneeze Wrong""), I think the ending of this movie has even more importance.  Tragic but necessary, this is the nature of reality.  What goes around comes around.  This isn't the ""most enlightening movie"" I've ever seen, but it has superb acting and direction and is absolutely a memorable film.",4,One of the darling films of the 90's with a message pertinent to today,1392508800,"02 16, 2014",2014,3133,"['remember', 'very', 'clearly', 'when', 'American', 'History', 'X', 'was', 'rage', 'guy', 'trench', 'coat', 'goatee', 'thought', 'was', 'best', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'never', 'saw', 'hate', 'consciously', 'politically', 'correct', 'films', 'tend', 'leave', 'out', 'gray', 'areas', 'reality', 'have', 'say', 'though', 'actually', 'pretty', 'realistic', 'film', 'what', 'can', 'transform', 'average', 'intensely', 'bright', 'person', 'being', 'disgruntled', 'alienated', 'full', 'racist', 'scumbag', 'are', 'always', 'predators', 'target', 'young', 'people', 'Skinheadism/Nazism', 'particularly', 'predatory', 'mold', 'cast', 'one', 'are', 'prison', 'street', 'film', 'specialize', 'urban', 'areas', 'where', 'tensions', 'uniquely', 'racial', 'exist.Edward', 'Norton', 'Derek', 'Vinyard', 'young', 'man', 'father', 'who', 'was', 'shot', 'urban', 'area', 'working', 'capacity', 'fireman', 'seemingly', 'randomly', 'nasty', 'comment', 'son', 'black', 'literature', 'are', 'two', 'fuses', 'blow', 'mind', 'Reichstag', 'firestorm', 'hatred', 'What', 'so', 'sad', 'story', 'not', 'only', 'diabolic', 'path', 'waste', 'obviously', 'enormous', 'intellect', 'predator', 'played', 'despicably', 'well', 'Stacy', 'Keach', 'Cameron', 'just', 'pedophile', 'white', 'kids', 'who', 'feel', 'pushed', 'minorities', 'feel', 'empowered', 'Nazi', 'ideology', 'time', 'Derek', 'surrogate', 'father', 'willing', 'do', 'bidding', 'anywhere', 'pushing', 'black', 'guys', 'basketball', 'court', 'giving', 'Himmlerlike', 'speeches', 'immigration', 'worthy', 'Joe', 'Arpaio', 'finally', 'murdering', 'three', 'black', 'guys', 'executing', 'one', 'infamous', 'curb', 'stomp', 'scene', 'really', 'perfectly', 'done', 'ambiguous', 'see', 'three', 'men', 'have', 'guns', 'are', 'threat', 'family', 'not', 'why', 'not', 'really', 'badly', 'so', 'fanatical', 'zeal.His', 'younger', 'brother', 'Danny', 'Edward', 'Furlong', 'lukewarm', 'version', 'older', 'brother', 'never', 'full', 'hate', 'disagree', 'viewers', 'who', 'see', 'really', 'older', 'brother', 'path', 'confused', 'environment', 'so', 'chaotic', 'can', 'not', 'form', 'opinion', 'anything', 'What', 'Derek', 'doing', 'realizing', 'encouraging', 'brother', 'involve', 'situations', 'ca', ""n't"", 'handle', 'one', 'killed.What', 'Derek', 'prison', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'quite', 'true', 'life', 'Anyone', 'who', 'known', 'true', 'skinhead', 'Neo', 'Nazi', 'aware', 'can', 'encounter', 'nice', 'minorities', 'anywhere', 'chat', 'end', 'day', 'dogma', 'usually', 'pretty', 'well', 'have', 'desire', 'human', 'interconnection', 'even', 'know', 'what', 'propose', 'BS', 'so', 'quick', 'Derek.Now', 'Stand', 'Ground', 'laws', 'i.e', 'Can', 'Shoot', 'Anyone', 'Sneeze', 'Wrong', 'think', 'ending', 'movie', 'even', 'more', 'importance', 'Tragic', 'necessary', 'nature', 'reality', 'What', 'around', 'around', ""n't"", 'most', 'enlightening', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'superb', 'acting', 'direction', 'absolutely', 'memorable', 'film']",N/A

This has a good  effect in the film, because his brother has convinced him that hatred is  good.  Danny's perspective shows how someone is forced to change his  viewpoints about a belief that he thought was absolutely true.  I could  relate to this because there are many situations in my life where I have  been forced to question assumptions that I thought were undeniably  true.The black and white parts are all flashbacks.  They make the point  that Derek's earlier attitudes were ""black and white"", but the movie  doesn't ever user that clich&eacute;. This means that Derek and Danny were blind  to the different colors or variations in life.  There is only one flashback  that is not black and white, and that is a flashback of the brothers  walking on the beach when they were a few years old.  I think this is meant  to show the innocence of youth, before their father introduced blind  prejudice into their lives.It seems to be a shock film to show the  people who are very prejudiced that their ways are wrong.  However, I think  that it is intended for people who like preachy films about racism.  I  usually don't like films that are this much of a lecture, but this film  worked for me because the characterization of Danny and Derek engrossed me.  Also, I could empathize with the conflicts in the movie, like their family  struggles and Derek's attitude of wanting to watch out for Derek.I felt  no different about race relations after watching this film.  I feel that  there are no inborn differences among people of different races; ergo, no  prejudice from me.  However, this film helped me to understand how someone  could get wrapped up in a ""skinhead"" mentality.  Also, I vicariously  experienced Derek's fear when he was in prison and the group of black  prisoners was about to turn on him.",4,Preachy but good,968198400,"09 6, 2000",2000,1867,"['Danny', 'younger', 'brother', 'Derek', 'story', 'good', 'effect', 'film', 'brother', 'convinced', 'hatred', 'good', 'Danny', 'perspective', 'how', 'someone', 'forced', 'change', 'viewpoints', 'belief', 'thought', 'was', 'absolutely', 'true', 'could', 'relate', 'are', 'many', 'situations', 'life', 'where', 'have', 'been', 'forced', 'question', 'assumptions', 'thought', 'were', 'undeniably', 'true.The', 'black', 'white', 'parts', 'are', 'flashbacks', 'make', 'point', 'Derek', 'earlier', 'attitudes', 'were', 'black', 'white', 'movie', ""n't"", 'ever', 'user', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Derek', 'Danny', 'were', 'blind', 'different', 'colors', 'variations', 'life', 'only', 'one', 'flashback', 'not', 'black', 'white', 'flashback', 'brothers', 'walking', 'beach', 'when', 'were', 'few', 'years', 'old', 'think', 'meant', 'show', 'innocence', 'youth', 'father', 'introduced', 'prejudice', 'lives.It', 'be', 'shock', 'film', 'show', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'very', 'prejudiced', 'ways', 'are', 'wrong', 'However', 'think', 'intended', 'people', 'who', 'preachy', 'films', 'racism', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'films', 'are', 'much', 'lecture', 'film', 'worked', 'characterization', 'Danny', 'Derek', 'engrossed', 'Also', 'could', 'empathize', 'conflicts', 'movie', 'family', 'struggles', 'Derek', 'attitude', 'wanting', 'watch', 'out', 'Derek.I', 'felt', 'different', 'race', 'relations', 'watching', 'film', 'feel', 'are', 'inborn', 'differences', 'people', 'different', 'races', 'prejudice', 'However', 'film', 'helped', 'understand', 'how', 'someone', 'could', 'get', 'wrapped', 'up', 'skinhead', 'mentality', 'Also', 'vicariously', 'experienced', 'Derek', 'fear', 'when', 'was', 'prison', 'group', 'black', 'prisoners', 'was', 'turn']",N/A
33849,A34D06JL7LC6MU,0780625129,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[5, 7]","""American History X"" can be looked at two ways. (A) A liberating piece of film making which deals with some important social issues in our society today or (B) a piece of (...) that is merely an excuse to see a black man have his face smashed into a curb. I realize, from reading the reviews on Amazon, that people view this film usually from these two perspectives. ""American History X"" may be violent (the film is rated R for Graphic Brutal Violence Including Rape, Pervasive Language and Strong Sexuality and Nudity) but despite the reasons for it's R rating and despite the violence used to portray waht point they are trying to get across; American History X is a fantastic film. Edward Norton scored his second Oscar nomination for the film, rightly so, as Derek Vinyard. Derek is sent to Chino prison for three years after he murders two black men attempting to steal his truck. Derek is also the leader of a group of White Supremacists (one of which played by Ethan Suplee).After getting out; Derek has changed and sees that his brother Danny (Edward Furlong) is following in his footsteps. The script, by David McKenna is right on target in showing racism and the consequences caused by it. The ending is sad & great; but movies are starting to develop a pattern in which the same ending occurs. Norton is brilliant in his role; going from playing skinhead nazi Derek to cleaned up Derek. Furlong is good, but wasn't the greatest choice to play Danny in my oppinion. I'm not saying this one of my favorite movies or even that it's one of the best films ever made; but I think this is one of those movies people should view at least once.

The death of Derek's father seems to be the catalyst for his seduction by Stacy Keach.Hate is truely blinding it seems because once Derek gives into his hate, he becomes compassionless, and void of human feelings, making him capable of committing murder and feeling good about it.Fortunately though, he meets his enemy (the black man) face to face in prison and actually has many conversations with him.Derek learns a lot about the man and himself.

33862,A2MS6UV7ZGTMLR,0780625129,"K. M. Talha ""Weird Gurl""","[4, 6]","Sometimes, a single image is enough to make or break a film's advertising, and the theatrical poster for American History X is an example of the latter. I think it was the image of Edward Furlong that also occupies the lower half of the cover artwork that broke the advertising campaign for me, although I didn't know what to make of Edward Norton until I recently viewed Fight Club. Not that the rest of the cast in this film particularly excited me, but seeing Norton in a role where he was the aggressor rather than the passive, whiny half of a disassociative tag team was worth the effort.Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) is a highly-placed member of the neo-Nazi contingent on Venice Beach, a tightly organized group with a similar political view to the Pat Robertsons and Fred Niles of this world. At the film's beginning, he is in the middle of having sex with his girlfriend, Stacey (Fairuza Balk), when a pair of Afro-Americans decide to break into his car. They are spotted by Derek's younger brother, Danny (Edward Furlong), who raises the alarm in spite of what a bad time to get Derek's attention it is.Derek responds in a similar manner to how many of us would when confronted with criminals breaking into our property - by beating them off with violence. However, in this case, the violent force he uses has lethal results for the young Afro-Americans, and Derek is sent to prison for three years as a result. Ignoring for a moment the fact that the thieves were armed, and that I find it hard to believe that a man would serve prison time for defending himself and his property (without Danny's testimony, they would barely have a case), the film jumps to a point where Danny is called before his school's principal, Bob Sweeney (Avery Brooks) to explain himself about an essay he wrote. The essay in question, entitled ""My Mein Kampf"", obviously ruffles a few feathers with the school's administration, but Sweeney tries to reach out to Danny, and does so by asking Danny to write another essay about his elder brother and the influence said brother has had over his life.On the same day, Derek is released from prison, and comes home to the celebrations of his crimes by his lover, his brother, and the men he calls his friends. What they discover on his return, however, is that prison has brought him several revelations that have dramatically changed him and his perspective on life and the life he once led. The plot summation to be found on the back cover is, in fact, surprisingly accurate, even if the story is a little simplistic in terms of detail, with the support cast not being particularly fleshed out. Herein lies one of this film's essential problems: comparisons to the Australian-produced Romper Stomper are inevitable in spite of the fact that the two films are stylistically very different beasts, and in terms of entertainment, the comparisons are not necessarily in favour of this film.

33871,AYW3H5NJ56EYW,0780625129,~LEON~,"[0, 0]","Reccomended to me by a friend, I really did not know what to expect with this film (although Ed Norton on the box with a shaved-head &amp; a 'white power' tattoo on his shoulder gave me a rough guess), so I had an open mind before I saw it.  (basic plot) The film is set in a neighbourhood in Venice, LA County, California.  After losing his father to a heartless gang-related shooting in Compton, where his dad was putting out a fire at a dealer's house, Derek (Ed Norton) takes a turn for the worse. A turn which sees him adopt the views of neo-Nazist Aerian supremacy. This bad turn in his life culminates in the hatred-fuelled murder of two Afro-American gangstas trying to steal his car one night. Needless to say, he winds up in the local correctional facility, and a whole bundle of laughs it ain't. Derek comes out a changed man (with the help of his ex-teacher, and a laundry-duty black con, who comes to be Derek's best friend inside), and knows he has to show his brother Danny (Edward furlong) the error of his ways before one of the local gun-toting gang-members decides white supremacists and black people don't mix, and does a nasty on one of them.  I can see why Norton was nominated for an oscar, his performance is chillingly real, and his acting is so convincing that even the most un-racist person will see the apparent logic behind some of his ideas, such as the contraversial Rodney king incident. Although obviously I'm not saying they're right, of course the whole point is that they aren't, but Norton's acting is persuasive enough to make you question your own opinion, if only (I hope) for the duration of the film.  Norton gained 30lbs of muscle for the role, and the skinhead, tattooed look helped him live his role as one of venice Beach's most violent men. He genuinely looks like the type of person who, with the backing of his gang of skinheads (portrayed in a particularly dumb light in this film, which could be a good thing) could square up to any of the neighbourhood Hispanic or African-American gangs. And it is this fearsomely efficient &amp; muscular physique, adorned with racist imagery, coupled with his sharp intelligence (he was a good student before he started all this rubbish) and supremacist views that, in his mind, justify the most brutal acts, that make him so dangerous.  Some viewers may find some of the scenes particularly heartless, but that is why they are there, to show the viewer how heartless hatred, fuelled by faulty ideas, can lead to tragedy. Taken for what it is, the film is pretty negative, but when reading between the lines you will see the positive message that the director intended you to.  It will make you think, and it will probably shock you, but get a copy of this and you won't be wishing you hadn't.

The third time, I shook my head and sighed at the fact that people like the characters in this movie -do- exist.This movie is, to put it plainly, about racism, and it has a subtle plot of redemption scarred by loss. The first is subject matter few directors or actors would dare to touch, but this movie takes such things to the extreme.Pros of this movie: Excellent acting. I have a new respect for Ed Norton after this; he portrayed semi-psychotic Derek very well. Edward Furlong portrayed impressionable Danny well, and then there were all the subcharacters who added an interesting flavor to the movie. The dialouge is powerful. This movie makes you listen. The locations added that grimy sense of ghetto to this movie, just as it should have. The black-and-white portions of the movie added a strange something to the movie...to me, it added to the black vs. white conflict that Derek encountered when...I won't tell and spoil it. :)Cons to this movie: Well, language, if that insults you. This movie favors the f-word a lot, but it's not for no reason, it has place in the movie. Well, racism, but that's the plot, so don't get it if it bothers you.

But I did buy American History X.This is the incredibly powerful story of two brothers who fall into the trap of racism and hate. It is also the story of these brothers trying to free themselves from racism and hate. After spending some time in prison for murdering two blacks who try and steal his car (a dispute starting with a basketball game), former neo-nazi Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) leaves his incarceration a changed man. To his dismay, however, he find that his younger brother is walking the same path he once did. The movie uses black-and-white scenes from the past in conjunction with color scenes in the current situation to establish Derek's sordid history as a vicious racist and show his path to change.The younger brother, Danny (Edward Furlong), idolizes Derek. In fact, the local coterie of skinheads all do. Derek has a power to feed the hate of his retinue with fiery rhetoric that targets ethnic groups indiscriminately with intense indignation. The movie is truly scary when you see the skinheads bonding, brought together by an irrational hate and Derek's ability to gratify it with his fierce oratories.Edward Norton was robbed when the Academy denied him the Oscar for Best Actor (he was nominated, though). His performance is compelling and real...frighteningly so. He effectively straddles the line between a smart kid with dumb ideas and the true racist seething with hate. I sincerely think he is one of Hollywood's most promising actors. Edward Furlong is also powerful, which is shocking for an actor of his age. Danny shares Derek's hate, but not the ability to convey it &quot;rationally.&quot; The script is stunning, likewise the directing and editing.The movie is violent and brutal, almost disturbingly so, but it is critical to underscore the power of the story. This is not tasteless killing. And it does not glorify racism...it exposes the consequences of racism and its absurdity. It shows how screwed-up people can rise above the pettiness of hate. One of the most powerful scenes in the movie is when Derek and Danny pull down all the Nazi crap on his bedroom wall.This movie is intense, as well. I must have lost 20 pounds watching it, because my heart was pounding insanely hard. The ending is horrifyingly sad...I have to wonder if I've ever been more moved by a movie.Be warned: It's brutal, gritty, and emotionally heavy.

If you live in a city it makes wonder what motivates people to do what they do and how they could perform such acts of violence. If you live in rural America you wonder the same thing but are glad you don't have neighborhood rival gangs around your home. Directed by Tony Kaye - the only film I know he has done to date - there is a sense of satisfaction with the completely sad ending of this film.Edward Norton does a phenomenal job as playing a kid, Derrick Vinyad growing up against all odds being thrown at him and going through the judicial system - and failing. Failing his family. After growing up in gangs and violence Edward's character goes to prison and threw several reform programs only to learn that his childhood was never a childhood. The help of Avery Brooks', Dr. Bob Sweeney, and the two travel a road down LA streets that would scare even the most indignant criminals.The photography is cleverly don the best part about the film is the kid playing Edwards brother, played by Edward Furlong, gives an incredible performance right until the end. The ending is shocking and almost disgusting - but the emotional impact is very real.There are not many DVD extra's on this one. There is no commentary which I would have liked to have heard from the director because apparently what I had heard is that he didn't like the studio cut of the film and filled a law suite to New Line in 1998 about not letting him use his pseudonym ""Humpty Humpty"" because he didn't like the final version of his film that New Line cut for him.

These things come to a head, when a ""king"" without his subjects is put in prison and found--through some crude persuasion--that his lifestyle was a ""game"" and not indicative of how things mostly are. Sure, some--as what happened in the school with blacks attacking the white boy--happens, but it's not the mainstream and--even if it was--they were wrong and are going to have to pay for their choices just like Norton had to pay for his choices. It even took his dramatic prison story to convert his little brother, which is true to life when you have prideful individuals doing wrong(the process is usually not magically easy, but takes specificity). This movie was very, very true to life; if a leader or prideful person is doing something wrong that he's very interested in, then it will either take a few big moments(as is the case with this movie) or smaller events over time(such as life maturing a person) to change them.

33890,A3PA0W1VUDU4J7,0780625129,Mat,"[12, 16]","It has been many years since I have seen this film. My memory attested it to be an excellent picture that meaningfully discussed issues as heavy as race relations, prejudice, and hatred. Unfortunately my memory is a little at fault, and upon viewing it this time I found it a bit disappointing. The film sets its sights to the heavens, and while succeeding in many ways, it could not attain such a lofty height. In trying to cover all the basis in such a thorny issue as race relations it cheats a bit in its storytelling. But we'll cover more of that in a bit.The plot involves a young, white Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) and the tumultuous 24 hours after his release from prison for killing two black men, while they were trying to steal his car. Much of the story is told in a flash backed black and white. Here we learn that Derek was a Neo-Nazi skinhead leader who has had a change of heart after his stint in prison. Post prison time is being spent trying to keep his brother, Danny (Edward Furlong) from following in his footsteps. A path he is already walking down.This is a powerful, moving film. Reading the boards on IMDB will attest to lives being changed through watching it. It works best when it shoots for an emotional response, rather than an intellectual one. Scenes such as when Edward Nortan's skin head leader rallies the troops to loot a local grocer, or the opening scene where we see Norton kill the two aforementioned black men, or a traumatic rape scene in prison, emit a guttural response from its viewers. It is in such scenes that we are rallied into discourse on the issues presented. Yet when the film gets talky it falls short of its ideals. It presents nothing beyond the general rhetoric you can find just about anywhere. In fact most of the rhetoric is spewed from the Neo-Nazi skinheads, and this type of discussion can be found every other day on day time talk shows. There is little in way of discussion from the rational, unprejudiced mind.There are two powerful performances from Edward Norton and Edward Furlong. At this point Norton was already beginning to take his role as the new Robert DeNiro, who had previously taken his turn as the new Marlon Brando. Let's hope he escapes the fate of mediocrity that they fell into. Furlong who once made Arnold Schwarzenegger look like Laurence Olivier with such a wooden performance, here has finally made himself worthy of attention. He gives a fine performance here, as a young man struggling with the passionate feelings of youth.Tackling an issue as heady as racism in America is a worthy, yet difficult cause. It proves to be too much for first time screenwriter David McKenna and director Tony Kaye. Trying to condense their story into regulation movie time they either skipped over completely or barely touched on some important issues. To give reasons for Derek's turn as a skinhead we are only allowed one small dinner table conversation with his father who spews some hateful race sentiments. This and his fathers murder at the hands of black addicts in a crackhouse, whom he was trying to save from a fire must suffice for an intelligent, middle class youths turn into a Nazi. Likewise his subsequent salvation in prison is not dwelt on enough to give us sufficient reasons for this turn of heart. Yes, the skinheads in prison are hypocrites, and yes the rape scene is brutal enough to turn away from their midst. But, his relationship with the black coworker, Lamont (Guy Torry) is not enough to change the heart of such hatred. Torry gives a fine performance, and does enough to show Derek that all blacks aren't as vile as the rhetoric made him believe, but are jokes about sex really going to make a skinhead believe in the goodness of the black race?In searching for a cause behind the Neo-Nazi scene in America the filmmakers seem to point directly towards the intense feelings of anger found in adolescence and the need to fit in with some social group. And rightly, these two issues play powerfully on the minds of many in the skinhead culture. But the issue goes deeper than this, and it is here, again, that this film misses the mark. Just as Derek dismisses issues of poverty, and social position in the plight of the black man this film seems to skim over some of the deeper motivation behind racism.Don't get me wrong. This is a powerful, well made film. There is plenty to chew upon and discuss. It is, in fact, a good film to watch with others and bring into light an important debate. Yet when I watch it I can't help but think of how it could have been better, how it could have reached the heights it was reaching for.(...)",3,"Passionate, flawed film",1110758400,"03 14, 2005",2005,4638,"['been', 'many', 'years', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'memory', 'attested', 'be', 'excellent', 'picture', 'meaningfully', 'discussed', 'issues', 'as', 'heavy', 'race', 'relations', 'prejudice', 'hatred', 'Unfortunately', 'memory', 'little', 'fault', 'viewing', 'time', 'found', 'bit', 'disappointing', 'film', 'sights', 'heavens', 'succeeding', 'many', 'ways', 'could', 'not', 'attain', 'such', 'lofty', 'height', 'trying', 'cover', 'basis', 'such', 'thorny', 'issue', 'race', 'relations', 'bit', 'storytelling', ""'ll"", 'cover', 'more', 'bit.The', 'plot', 'young', 'white', 'Derek', 'Vinyard', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'tumultuous', '24', 'hours', 'release', 'prison', 'killing', 'two', 'black', 'men', 'were', 'trying', 'steal', 'car', 'Much', 'story', 'told', 'flash', 'backed', 'black', 'white', 'Here', 'learn', 'Derek', 'was', 'Neo-Nazi', 'skinhead', 'leader', 'who', 'had', 'change', 'heart', 'stint', 'prison', 'Post', 'prison', 'time', 'being', 'spent', 'trying', 'keep', 'brother', 'Danny', 'Edward', 'Furlong', 'following', 'footsteps', 'path', 'already', 'walking', 'down.This', 'powerful', 'moving', 'film', 'Reading', 'boards', 'IMDB', 'will', 'attest', 'lives', 'being', 'changed', 'watching', 'best', 'when', 'shoots', 'emotional', 'response', 'rather', 'intellectual', 'one', 'Scenes', 'such', 'when', 'Edward', 'Nortan', 'skin', 'head', 'leader', 'troops', 'loot', 'local', 'grocer', 'opening', 'scene', 'where', 'see', 'Norton', 'kill', 'two', 'aforementioned', 'black', 'men', 'traumatic', 'rape', 'scene', 'prison', 'emit', 'guttural', 'response', 'viewers', 'such', 'scenes', 'are', 'rallied', 'discourse', 'issues', 'presented', 'when', 'film', 'talky', 'short', 'ideals', 'nothing', 'general', 'rhetoric', 'can', 'find', 'just', 'about', 'anywhere', 'fact', 'most', 'rhetoric', 'spewed', 'Neo-Nazi', 'skinheads', 'type', 'discussion', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'other', 'day', 'day', 'time', 'talk', 'shows', 'little', 'way', 'discussion', 'rational', 'unprejudiced', 'are', 'two', 'powerful', 'performances', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'Edward', 'Furlong', 'point', 'Norton', 'was', 'already', 'beginning', 'take', 'role', 'new', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'who', 'had', 'previously', 'taken', 'turn', 'new', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'Let', 'hope', 'fate', 'mediocrity', 'fell', 'Furlong', 'who', 'once', 'made', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'look', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'wooden', 'performance', 'here', 'finally', 'made', 'worthy', 'attention', 'fine', 'performance', 'here', 'young', 'man', 'struggling', 'passionate', 'feelings', 'youth.Tackling', 'issue', 'as', 'heady', 'racism', 'America', 'worthy', 'yet', 'difficult', 'cause', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'first', 'time', 'screenwriter', 'David', 'McKenna', 'director', 'Tony', 'Kaye', 'Trying', 'condense', 'story', 'regulation', 'movie', 'time', 'skipped', 'over', 'completely', 'barely', 'touched', 'important', 'issues', 'give', 'reasons', 'Derek', 'turn', 'skinhead', 'are', 'only', 'allowed', 'one', 'small', 'dinner', 'table', 'conversation', 'father', 'who', 'hateful', 'race', 'sentiments', 'fathers', 'murder', 'hands', 'black', 'addicts', 'crackhouse', 'whom', 'was', 'trying', 'save', 'fire', 'must', 'suffice', 'intelligent', 'middle', 'class', 'youths', 'turn', 'Nazi', 'Likewise', 'subsequent', 'salvation', 'prison', 'not', 'dwelt', 'enough', 'give', 'sufficient', 'reasons', 'turn', 'heart', 'Yes', 'skinheads', 'prison', 'are', 'hypocrites', 'yes', 'rape', 'scene', 'brutal', 'enough', 'turn', 'away', 'midst', 'relationship', 'black', 'coworker', 'Lamont', 'Guy', 'Torry', 'not', 'enough', 'change', 'heart', 'such', 'hatred', 'Torry', 'fine', 'performance', 'enough', 'show', 'Derek', 'blacks', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'vile', 'rhetoric', 'made', 'believe', 'are', 'jokes', 'sex', 'really', 'going', 'make', 'skinhead', 'believe', 'goodness', 'black', 'race', 'searching', 'cause', 'Neo-Nazi', 'scene', 'America', 'filmmakers', 'seem', 'point', 'directly', 'intense', 'feelings', 'anger', 'found', 'adolescence', 'need', 'fit', 'social', 'group', 'rightly', 'two', 'issues', 'play', 'powerfully', 'minds', 'many', 'skinhead', 'culture', 'issue', 'deeper', 'here', 'again', 'film', 'mark', 'Just', 'Derek', 'issues', 'poverty', 'social', 'position', 'plight', 'black', 'man', 'film', 'skim', 'deeper', 'motivation', 'racism.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'powerful', 'well', 'made', 'film', 'plenty', 'chew', 'upon', 'discuss', 'fact', 'good', 'film', 'watch', 'others', 'bring', 'light', 'important', 'debate', 'when', 'watch', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'how', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'how', 'could', 'have', 'reached', 'heights', 'was', 'reaching', 'for.']",N/A

The fact that it failed at the boxoffice is not surprising. In our modern age, what's most important it that it was made and is available for anyone who chooses to see it.It is simply done, yet exquisite in its deliberate use of both black and white and color. The colors show often that the stark contrasts of black and white are often just an illusion. The world is far more complex than black, white and shades of gray can capture.It is the story of an average American boy named Derek [Edward Norton in his Oscar nominated performance] who turns into a neo-Nazi skinhead. How this decision affects the lives of his younger brother Danny [Edward Furlong in his best role] and the rest of his family, not to mention the lives of others around him, is the focus of the movie. Yet it is far more than the story of a bigoted boy gone bad. It deals with the basic nature of racial hatred and plays more like a modern updating of an idea by William Shakespeare than anything else I can think of.If I have any negative opinion of this film, it is that there was not time in it to fully flesh out every thing it addresses. This is a minor complaint, and is far better than films that go on and on about a thing long after we've gotten the point.Edward Norton truly deserved his Oscar nomination for Best Actor. I never though I'd see the day when Robert DiNero would have a competitor, but if it isn't Norton, then it isn't anyone.Every part of this movie rang true to me - the simple, middle-class family struggling to survive, the love between brothers, the scenes in prison.

33898,A8YJ32NRV39I6,0780625129,M. George,"[1, 1]","American History X comes out as a film that will stick with you after watching it with it's great performances, great writing, and some very well thought out and realized characters, yet one can't but feel it missed the mark on a couple things that could have made the film more than what it is.To start off, the performance by Edward Norton is what really carries the movie by playing as Derek, a neo-nazi before and after his time in prison, and he is essentially the leader of a surprisingly large neo-nazi group in LA, which includes his young brother, his friends and his girlfriend. Of course, this group is very violent and filled with hate and serves as the focus in the film on how they react to their local community.Norton and his character really shine by despite being a man filled with irrational and misdirected hate he is able to bring up numerous great arguments and points, making him into an obviously intelligent person and less of a simple racist stereotype. Yet I had trouble believing in his shift of nature that occurs as the focus throughout most of the movie, where it seems to be less of a slow change and more of just because one or two convenient key events, which I felt, made the movie considerably less subtle and even impactful.I also felt that while still heavily invested in the characters and the events they find themselves in, it all felt a bit predictable. Once realizing the grim nature of the film, one will eventually start predicting the twists and turns before they even happen.Like many great movies, this one has many scenes be made into wonderfully tense and powerful. Often tense without the use of violence or something to that effect, just tense with the use of great writing and performances from the characters where the hostility towards one another could be cut with a knife.While not to degrade the movie, the only release for this movie on Blu-ray serves as very bare-bones, with the only two special features being the trailer for the movie, and a short handful of deleted/extended scenes that are pretty good though. Yet the video and audio quality is pretty good, surprised to see the numerous black and white sections to look the best.I strongly recommend this movie as more of an emotional then intellectual look at modern racism in America.",4,"Falls a bit short of modern classic, yet still great",1356652800,"12 28, 2012",2012,2302,"['American', 'History', 'X', 'out', 'film', 'will', 'stick', 'watching', 'great', 'performances', 'great', 'writing', 'very', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'realized', 'characters', 'yet', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'feel', 'missed', 'mark', 'couple', 'things', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'film', 'more', 'what', 'is.To', 'start', 'off', 'performance', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'what', 'really', 'movie', 'playing', 'Derek', 'neo-nazi', 'before', 'time', 'prison', 'essentially', 'leader', 'surprisingly', 'large', 'neo-nazi', 'group', 'LA', 'young', 'brother', 'friends', 'girlfriend', 'course', 'group', 'very', 'violent', 'filled', 'hate', 'focus', 'film', 'how', 'react', 'local', 'community.Norton', 'character', 'really', 'shine', 'being', 'man', 'filled', 'irrational', 'misdirected', 'hate', 'able', 'bring', 'up', 'numerous', 'great', 'arguments', 'points', 'making', 'obviously', 'intelligent', 'person', 'less', 'simple', 'racist', 'stereotype', 'had', 'trouble', 'believing', 'shift', 'nature', 'focus', 'most', 'movie', 'where', 'be', 'less', 'slow', 'change', 'more', 'just', 'one', 'two', 'convenient', 'key', 'events', 'felt', 'made', 'movie', 'considerably', 'less', 'subtle', 'even', 'impactful.I', 'also', 'felt', 'still', 'heavily', 'invested', 'characters', 'events', 'find', 'felt', 'bit', 'predictable', 'Once', 'realizing', 'grim', 'nature', 'film', 'one', 'will', 'eventually', 'start', 'predicting', 'twists', 'turns', 'even', 'happen.Like', 'many', 'great', 'movies', 'one', 'many', 'scenes', 'be', 'made', 'wonderfully', 'tense', 'powerful', 'Often', 'tense', 'use', 'violence', 'something', 'effect', 'just', 'tense', 'use', 'great', 'writing', 'performances', 'characters', 'where', 'hostility', 'one', 'could', 'be', 'cut', 'knife.While', 'not', 'degrade', 'movie', 'only', 'release', 'movie', 'Blu-ray', 'serves', 'very', 'bare-bones', 'only', 'two', 'special', 'features', 'being', 'trailer', 'movie', 'short', 'handful', 'deleted/extended', 'scenes', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'video', 'audio', 'quality', 'pretty', 'good', 'surprised', 'see', 'numerous', 'black', 'white', 'sections', 'look', 'best.I', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'more', 'emotional', 'then', 'intellectual', 'look', 'modern', 'racism', 'America']",N/A

This is a beautifully photographed and wonderfully written movie that takes a very strong subject, and forms it all into a truly unique film. Norton is amazing - He has such as tremendous range as an actor that it so difficult that he also played a neurotic New Yorker in Woody Allen's Everyone Says I Love You. His buffed-up physique, shaved head, and goatee all make him look incredibly realistic as a Los Angeles skinhead (and worried some that skinheads would become chic). His performance is incredible, as are the standout supporting performances from Avery Brooks as the black teacher who believes in both Derek and Danny, and Stacy Keach (who seems determined to break his image as Mike Hammer) as the head white supremacist in town. First-time feature director Tony Kaye (who also served as cinematographer) directs and photographs this film beautifully, and Anne Dudley's score is one to remember.

Not many films would dare to peer into the cancer that is white supremacy, reveal its twisted yet nearly  convincing logic, yet show that there can be a redemption of sorts.The  most thought-provoking scenes occur during Derek's (Edward Norton)  transformation in prison. Here, he finds that everything is not as he  thought it was, and that some injustices are very real. He eventually  befriends a black inmate who unconditionally treats him as an equal  (despite clearly knowing Derek's racist views), and soon learns that his  friend is serving 6 years for a mere theft that has been trumped up to  &quot;assault of a police officer&quot;, while his own sentence for  murdering two black men is lesser. And yet this does not come off as some  preachy statement on the injustices faced by blacks who commit crimes  versus whites. The film levels the playing field quite admirably. Avery  Brooks does a fine job as Sweeney, a black teacher who recognizes the blind  hatred in Derek and consequently in his younger brother Daniel (Edward  Furlong), who is swiftly following in his brothers footsteps. Sweeney,  reflecting on his own youth, sheds light on reverse-racism in growing up  black. Both Edwards (Norton and Furlong) deliver intensely real  performances.This film, like no other I have seen in recent years, so  well conveys the concept that the only real enemy is not to be found in  another person, but in the blind, untempered hatred within us fueled by our  fears, insecurities and misunderstanding.",5,Fight the real enemy: hate,952387200,"03 7, 2000",2000,1635,"['was', ""n't"", 'too', 'keen', 'watching', 'film', 'based', 'premise', 'truly', 'one', 'best', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Not', 'many', 'films', 'would', 'dare', 'peer', 'cancer', 'white', 'supremacy', 'reveal', 'twisted', 'yet', 'nearly', 'convincing', 'logic', 'show', 'can', 'be', 'redemption', 'sorts.The', 'most', 'thought-provoking', 'scenes', 'occur', 'Derek', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'transformation', 'prison', 'Here', 'everything', 'not', 'thought', 'was', 'injustices', 'are', 'very', 'real', 'eventually', 'black', 'inmate', 'who', 'unconditionally', 'equal', 'clearly', 'knowing', 'Derek', 'racist', 'views', 'soon', 'learns', 'friend', 'serving', '6', 'years', 'mere', 'theft', 'been', 'trumped', 'up', 'quot', 'assault', 'police', 'officer', 'quot', 'own', 'sentence', 'murdering', 'two', 'black', 'men', 'lesser', 'yet', 'not', 'come', 'off', 'preachy', 'statement', 'injustices', 'faced', 'blacks', 'who', 'commit', 'crimes', 'versus', 'whites', 'film', 'levels', 'playing', 'field', 'quite', 'admirably', 'Avery', 'Brooks', 'fine', 'job', 'Sweeney', 'black', 'teacher', 'who', 'blind', 'hatred', 'Derek', 'consequently', 'younger', 'brother', 'Daniel', 'Edward', 'Furlong', 'who', 'swiftly', 'following', 'brothers', 'footsteps', 'Sweeney', 'reflecting', 'own', 'youth', 'sheds', 'light', 'reverse-racism', 'growing', 'up', 'black', 'Edwards', 'Norton', 'Furlong', 'deliver', 'intensely', 'real', 'performances.This', 'film', 'other', 'have', 'seen', 'recent', 'years', 'so', 'well', 'conveys', 'concept', 'only', 'real', 'enemy', 'not', 'be', 'found', 'person', 'blind', 'untempered', 'hatred', 'fueled', 'fears', 'insecurities', 'misunderstanding']",N/A

Ever since then, Derek has been filled with hate, rage, violence, and racism. He joins up with Cameron Alexander ( Stacey Keach) who is the leader of the Nazi movement in Los Angeles. One night Derek catches three African American men breaking into his car, and he kills them. Derek is sent to prison for six years. While inside, Derek reluctantly becomes friends with an African American prisoner named Lamont (Guy Torry). Over time, Lamont causes Derek to realize that all his hate and anger never made his life any better. Now he is out and a changed man. Unfortunately , his brother Danny ( Edward Furlong) is headed in the exact same direction Derek was, and loves the life of a Nazi. Now it is up to Derek to save his brother and teach him the true meaning of redemption.""American History X"" is one of the best films that I have ever seen. The story is amazing, all the actors are outstanding, and the script provides for shocking scenes and great dialogue overall. The film takes an extremely controversial look at racism and shows just how damaging it can be. Watching the film unfold will leave you in awe. The parts dealing with Derek's past are shot in black and white to give them more of an ominous appeal. The present is shot in color to give the appearance of hope. Edward Norton gives the performance of his career as Derek Vinyard. He plays both sides of the character great. He is very convincing as a skinhead, and after prison shows that redemption is possible. Edward Furlong in my opinion did the best job in the movie. Furlong supplies extremely realistic emotion to let the audience know the inner conflict that his character is dealing with. The reason the character has such an impact on the film is because he is only trying to be like his brother. The rest of the cast was filled with excellent actors that include Stacey Keach, Avery Brooks, Ethan Suplee, Beverly De Angelo, and Fairuza Balk.""American History X"" is a highly controversial and disturbing film.

Reverse discrimination is mentioned in one scene, and I somewhat agree that reverse discrimination accelerated hate crime. I did not grow up in America and do not know how it feels to hate other races, but I often felt hopeless being caught between black and white in times of conflicts since I am neither black nor white.The change in this film sadly cost them one of their lives. I think any time a change occurs there is a friction, and the friction can be extremely sad as a result.Also, the film reminded me of the fact that we all cannot escape Karma - a consistency of cause and effect.

It mainly focuses on white supremacy, but we never see the other side to racism which were only a few parts in the movie when the african american boys were teasing furlong for being white and making racist comments. The whole movie is focuses on skinheads being racist against blacks, hispanics, and jews, but we hardly get much from the other perspective which is the ones racosxt against whites. But yes it's a nazi movie so i can understand why it's so one sided. There are a few flaws, but i do believe the most important points were focused on in the film, and the main issue is violence associated with racism. But many parts seemed a little unrealistic like the bastketball scene. Come on, if the skinheads won in real life, and they dont the black guys to get their ""black asses off the court"" that would have resulted in some sort of fight or worse, and lets not forget the slam dunk by norton, which always made me and my roomate laugh. I know it's a movie and it's suppose to be sensationalized. Despite it's flaws it's still a very good film that people can learn from. Whenever i hear this movie being mentioned, i always hear how hard it has hit it's viewers and the strong ,message that it has, which defeats the little flaws it has, it's still a great filmAs for the murder scene. I do feel you have a right to protect your family and property, and the black males did have guns, but why were they strapped while stealing a car, and one guy waiting near the front door, and they only fleed because norton had a gun and chased them while shooting. I'm not condoning the curb murder, which was brutal, and it was a genius way to show the fact that norton was losing his mind up till that point, and thats why he's smiling like a lunatic when the police get there. I dont think the reviewers were saying it was fine doing that, it's just mixed feelings about protecting your family and property. But yes the crypts were fleeing, after trying to steal the truck, and had guns, but thats no excuse to commit that haneous murder, by splitting the guys head open on the curb. That scene was written in to reflect dereyk's frame on mind at the time, and then going to prison, where he has a chance to think about his life of hatred, and his crime.",5,Unforgettable,1129939200,"10 22, 2005",2005,2403,"['do', 'think', 'brilliant', 'film', 'extraordinary', 'performance', 'edward', 'norton', 'i', 'also', 'do', 'agree', 'reviews', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'mainly', 'white', 'supremacy', 'never', 'see', 'other', 'side', 'racism', 'were', 'only', 'few', 'parts', 'movie', 'when', 'african', 'american', 'boys', 'were', 'teasing', 'furlong', 'being', 'white', 'making', 'racist', 'comments', 'whole', 'movie', 'focuses', 'skinheads', 'being', 'racist', 'blacks', 'hispanics', 'jews', 'hardly', 'get', 'much', 'other', 'perspective', 'ones', 'racosxt', 'whites', 'nazi', 'movie', 'i', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'so', 'one', 'sided', 'are', 'few', 'flaws', 'i', 'do', 'believe', 'most', 'important', 'points', 'were', 'focused', 'film', 'main', 'issue', 'violence', 'associated', 'racism', 'many', 'parts', 'seemed', 'little', 'unrealistic', 'bastketball', 'scene', 'Come', 'skinheads', 'won', 'real', 'life', 'dont', 'black', 'guys', 'get', 'black', 'court', 'would', 'have', 'resulted', 'sort', 'fight', 'worse', 'not', 'forget', 'slam', 'dunk', 'norton', 'always', 'made', 'roomate', 'laugh', 'know', 'movie', 'suppose', 'be', 'sensationalized', 'flaws', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'people', 'can', 'learn', 'Whenever', 'i', 'hear', 'movie', 'being', 'mentioned', 'i', 'always', 'hear', 'how', 'hard', 'hit', 'viewers', 'strong', 'message', 'little', 'flaws', 'still', 'great', 'filmAs', 'murder', 'scene', 'do', 'feel', 'have', 'right', 'protect', 'family', 'property', 'black', 'males', 'did', 'have', 'guns', 'why', 'were', 'strapped', 'stealing', 'car', 'one', 'guy', 'waiting', 'front', 'door', 'only', 'fleed', 'norton', 'had', 'gun', 'chased', 'shooting', ""'m"", 'not', 'condoning', 'curb', 'murder', 'was', 'brutal', 'was', 'genius', 'way', 'show', 'fact', 'norton', 'was', 'losing', 'mind', 'up', 'till', 'point', 'thats', 'why', 'smiling', 'lunatic', 'when', 'police', 'get', 'there', 'dont', 'think', 'reviewers', 'were', 'saying', 'was', 'fine', 'doing', 'just', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'protecting', 'family', 'property', 'crypts', 'were', 'fleeing', 'trying', 'steal', 'truck', 'had', 'guns', 'excuse', 'commit', 'haneous', 'murder', 'splitting', 'guys', 'head', 'open', 'curb', 'scene', 'was', 'written', 'reflect', 'dereyk', 'frame', 'mind', 'time', 'then', 'going', 'prison', 'where', 'chance', 'think', 'life', 'hatred', 'crime']",N/A

Recommended it by a friend I eventually sat down to watch it.  When I did I was completely mesmerised.  It takes an incredibly difficult premise and manages to make it credible, evocative and tragic.  It's basically about a member of a white supremacy group, Edward Norton, who goes to prison for three years after killing three car theifs in a race attack.  Told through the eyes of his younger brother, played by Edward Furlong, as he begins to follow in the footsteps of his brother.  The movie takes a look at Norton's time in prison, his return and his effect on those around him.'American History X' certainly doesn't shy away from some of its key moments and is highly graphic, so be warned.  Never before have I watched such horrible sights of brutality and been moved to such an extent, some scenes are just so horrible that you will find yourself crying out.  This makes it even more hard-hitting, and its message is a lot more complicated than 'racism is bad'.  It talks about the effect of society on a disillusioned youth population, racial friction and the family unit.Thanks to Edward Norton's brave, compelling performance, the audience is really dragged into his emotional turmoil.  His performance is unflinching, refusing to cop out and go for the sympathetic vote.  He's backed up by strong performances from Edward Furlong (the kid from 'Terminator 2') and Fairuza Balk (a much underrated actress whose formidable acting ability is yet again proved here) as his girlfriend.This is a movie that has several levels to it.

33913,A1YHKSTVSYEYTU,0780625129,Mr. N. Carnegie,"[14, 16]","Edward Norton gives an extraordinarily brilliant (and Oscar nominated) performance as Derek Vinyard, a neo-nazi skinhead in this explosive and powerful drama about two brothers caught up in a cycle of racial hatred and violence. Told through the eyes of Derek's younger brother Danny, superbly portrayed by Edward Furlong, this is the story of a family torn apart after the loss of their firefighter father, killed whilst working in a black neighbourhood. As a result, the highly intelligent Derek (Norton), already influenced by his late father's bigotry and manipulated by cowardly fascist Cameron Alexander (Stacy Keach) becomes the charismatic leader of a local gang of skinheads. This inevitably leads to friction within Derek's family and his imprisonment for the murder of two black youths. Whilst in prison hero-worshipping Danny (Furlong) seeks to emulate his older brother and becomes more and more involved with the white power movement and influenced by Cameron (Keach) and his mindless morons. However, with a hero's welcome being planned for Derek's release from prison, he returns to his neighbourhood a changed man and sets out to repair the damage he's done to his family and to persuade his brother not to travel the same road.Brilliantly written by David Mc.Kenna and with top-notch performances from both its male leads (ably supported by Avery Brooks and Stacy Keach) American History X is an intelligent and powerful examination of the causes and existence of racial bigotry and hatred. It does not seek to sensationalise rascism or violence but neither does it duck the issues. Controversial because of its frank portrayal of rascists as human beings, the scariest part of watching American History X is how credible and believable Edward Norton's rascists arguments (as the charismatic leader Derek Vinyard) can be and how easy it must be for impressionable youth to be drawn into a world of hatred and violence. This is as much education as entertainment and essential viewing for fans of intelligent drama.

The way this movie uses the language of racism, whether gutter or sophisticated, as well as the rabble-rousing rhetoric an' intelligence of Edward Norton's character Derek, makes for a damn compelling watch.This probably is one'a the best an' more important films of its year. It's beautifully shot, intriguing an' definitely thought-provoking. But whenever discussions are brought up about this film, whether someone felt it was good or not, it seems that the one unanimous praise is Norton's performance. He was one'a my favorite actors before this based on his should'a-won-the-Oscar performance in 'Primal Fear', but he friggin' ASTOUNDED me in his ability to be completely immersed in two so different roles here; one as a neo-Nazi skinhead, with bulging muscles, a shaved head, and a swastika tattoed over his heart, an' one as a lonely, disillusioned young man who must struggle to redeem himself. He personified the concept of a bright kid with bad ideas; he's burning with hatred from what has been learned through his father's death and the struggle to find an ideology and a purpose in life.Grief-stricken and lonely, Derek has become the man of a dysfunctional household. His father's death while tryin' to preserve a burnin' crackhouse has motivated Derek toward the Nazi cause an' it's here that we see Venice Beach as a breeding ground for hate crimes an' white supremacist rallies with Derek as the mos' charismatic orater.The boiling point comes when two black guys attempt to steal Derek's car one night, after bein' provoked by gettin' slammed on the basketball court. He marches out in his undies with a gun clutched in his hand.  He murders them in cold blood right there on the street outside his house; torturing an' brutalizing both of them. Is' a disturbing scene but nothing is more striking and horrifying than the sequence when the police arrive; there's a glimmer in his eye an' a proud smile on his face, as the haunting score rises over the soundtrack.  He's staring at his little brother who witnessed the whole incident.  And he's staring with the shameless pride an' honor of a man who had just doled out a taste of ""justice"". These early scenes as well as the ending, are some'a the most compelling pieces of filmmaking I've seen in a long time.  So much so, that it almost completely overshadows some of the sloppy and rushed quality of the rest of it, like the fact that Derek's prison experience isn't really touched upon quite enough, an' the way the film seems to want to cover too much ground in too little time.Using black and white to show the recent past, and color to show the 24-hour period after Derek is released from prison, Tony Kaye gives meaning an' relevance to the simplest thing, like the newly-reformed Derek staring at himself in the mirror after a shower the first night back home, looking at the swastika on his heart.  The newfound sense of humanity and compassion for human life has finally brought out the shame in him.  As he stares, he places his right hand over his heart, covering up the swastika.  Filled with depression, guilt, an' regret over his life, he can only dream of what he could have been and look forward.  In spite of its shortcomings, this is a good and powerful film that MUST be seen and understood.",4,"Riveting, thought-provoking an' emotional stuff, in spite of a hurried script...",1005955200,"11 17, 2001",2001,3409,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'flick', 'know', 'hard', 'trivialize', 'very', 'REAL', 'STRONG', 'message', 'tryin', 'convey', 'way', 'movie', 'language', 'racism', 'gutter', 'sophisticated', 'as', 'well', 'rabble-rousing', 'rhetoric', 'intelligence', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'character', 'Derek', 'damn', 'compelling', 'watch.This', 'probably', 'one', 'best', 'more', 'important', 'films', 'year', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'intriguing', 'definitely', 'thought-provoking', 'whenever', 'discussions', 'are', 'brought', 'up', 'film', 'someone', 'felt', 'was', 'good', 'not', 'one', 'unanimous', 'praise', 'Norton', 'performance', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'based', 'should', 'a-won-the-Oscar', 'performance', ""'Primal"", 'Fear', 'friggin', 'ASTOUNDED', 'ability', 'be', 'completely', 'immersed', 'two', 'so', 'different', 'roles', 'here', 'one', 'neo-Nazi', 'skinhead', 'bulging', 'muscles', 'shaved', 'head', 'swastika', 'tattoed', 'heart', 'one', 'lonely', 'disillusioned', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'must', 'struggle', 'redeem', 'personified', 'concept', 'bright', 'kid', 'bad', 'ideas', 'burning', 'hatred', 'what', 'been', 'learned', 'father', 'death', 'struggle', 'find', 'ideology', 'purpose', 'life.Grief-stricken', 'lonely', 'Derek', 'become', 'man', 'dysfunctional', 'household', 'father', 'death', 'tryin', 'preserve', 'burnin', 'crackhouse', 'motivated', 'Derek', 'Nazi', 'cause', 'here', 'see', 'Venice', 'Beach', 'breeding', 'ground', 'hate', 'crimes', 'white', 'supremacist', 'rallies', 'Derek', 'mos', 'charismatic', 'orater.The', 'boiling', 'point', 'when', 'two', 'black', 'guys', 'attempt', 'steal', 'Derek', 'car', 'one', 'night', 'bein', 'provoked', 'gettin', 'slammed', 'basketball', 'court', 'out', 'undies', 'gun', 'clutched', 'hand', 'cold', 'blood', 'right', 'there', 'street', 'house', 'torturing', ""'"", 'brutalizing', 'disturbing', 'scene', 'nothing', 'more', 'striking', 'horrifying', 'sequence', 'when', 'police', 'arrive', 'glimmer', 'eye', 'proud', 'smile', 'face', 'haunting', 'score', 'soundtrack', 'staring', 'little', 'brother', 'who', 'witnessed', 'whole', 'incident', 'staring', 'shameless', 'honor', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'just', 'doled', 'out', 'taste', 'justice', 'early', 'scenes', 'as', 'well', 'ending', 'are', 'most', 'compelling', 'pieces', 'filmmaking', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'So', 'much', 'almost', 'completely', 'sloppy', 'rushed', 'quality', 'rest', 'fact', 'Derek', 'prison', 'experience', ""n't"", 'really', 'touched', 'quite', 'enough', 'way', 'film', 'want', 'cover', 'too', 'much', 'ground', 'too', 'little', 'time.Using', 'black', 'white', 'show', 'recent', 'past', 'color', 'show', '24-hour', 'period', 'Derek', 'released', 'prison', 'Tony', 'Kaye', 'meaning', 'relevance', 'simplest', 'thing', 'newly-reformed', 'Derek', 'staring', 'mirror', 'shower', 'first', 'night', 'back', 'home', 'looking', 'swastika', 'heart', 'newfound', 'sense', 'humanity', 'compassion', 'human', 'life', 'finally', 'brought', 'out', 'shame', 'right', 'hand', 'heart', 'covering', 'up', 'swastika', 'Filled', 'depression', 'guilt', 'regret', 'life', 'can', 'only', 'dream', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'look', 'forward', 'spite', 'shortcomings', 'good', 'powerful', 'film', 'MUST', 'be', 'seen', 'understood']",N/A

Norton is hypnotic and lights up the screen whenever he appears as the young and charismatic Derek Vinyard, a former white supremicist who has re-thought his ways during his time in prison, and now fights to save his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) from a similar fate.  As the Amazon review above states, Norton is so convincing in his role that you can almost detect a shred of logic in Derek's views before his prison time, and he is so immersed in his role (from his bulked up body to his swastika tattooed across his heart) that you'll find his Oscar nomination for Best Actor quite well deserved (and some may even feel he was robbed), and Norton proves that he is one of the most daring and finest actors of today.  Furlong gives the best performance of his career, and he deserved much more acclaim for his performance than he received.  The cast also includes Beverly D'Angelo as Derek and Danny's mother, Stacy Keach as Derek's former neo-nazi mentor, and Avery Brooks as Derek's former teacher; all of whom give knockout performances.  All in all, American History X is one of the most powerful films to come along in quite some time, and it is carried on the shoulders of Norton's brilliant performance.

I spoke to a friend of mine in 2001 and he told me that it was good so I looked at him like he was crazy. I decided to see it in 2005 and was blown away by how good it was. Now, look if you can handle extremely harsh racial rhetoric you're about to hear then you can find out that this movie is a gem with great performances and a good look at racism and its effects on people's lives.Plot/spoiler: Derek Vinyard(Edward Norton) is a well-known white supremacist who just received jail time for a carjacker. In jail he realizes how wrong-headed he has been and sees how fellow white supremacists don't even follow the ""morals"" they set(add to that another incident I wont give away to anybody who hasn't seen it). He befriends a black inmate named Lamont(Guy Torry). He drops his hateful ways, is released from jail and comes home to find his brother Danny(Edward Furlong) going down the same destructive path. Danny Vinyard has a dilemma also. His professor, Dr. Sweeney(played by the underrated and underused Avery Brooks) is not happy on the report that Danny wrote on the views of the most notorious killer in world history(I wont spoil that for you either), so he has him write his report again so Danny writes about his brother and their life growing up.Opinion: This is the best movie of 1998 and I'll go out on a limb and say that this is one of the most important films in history. Edward Norton gives an excellent performance as the prejudiced Danny Vinyard who lives his life through hate only to realized how misguided and confused his hatred was. I've always hated Edward Furlong(since the god-awful Pet Sematery 2) but he gives a good performance as the brother who goes down the same sad path of his brother. Beverly D'Angelo is in top form as the mother who has to put up with the pain her son causes with his racism. Avery Brooks is great as Dr. Sweeney and Guy Torry is his usual goofy but funny self as Lamont. The story is well-written and well acted without coming off as pretentious. You really believed that those characters thought that way. American History X tackles a most feared subject in America without trivializing it and the movie itself was not made to teach hate. It was meant to tell a story of a man filled with hate but later realizes the error of his ways and tries to stop his brother from making the same mistake.

The film tells his story through the eyes of his brother (Furlong) who must write a paper for his principle on his brother's life as punishment for writing an essay on Adolf Hitler.The film poses a number of great questions and answers many of them, although we will never actually get to see the REAL American History X because Kaye was locked out of the editing room, by Hollywood executives and Norton, in an attempt to control Norton's content on the screen and to give it a Hollywood flavor which can be seen throughout the picture when Norton does the sudden U-Turn with the Nazi brother and suddenly become ""good guys"" almost overnight. Yes, it is hard to believe at times and certainly there is a lot to spoon down in that department, but overall the film is certainly very good and plays out well even if the story is a bit contrived at times, however you will LOVE the cinematography that Kaye produces on the screen and this film does indeed look lush in its color, black and white, slow motion sequences.Definitely a picture worth looking at - to look at, and although the story does have a lot of impact it might be a little artificial in a Hollywood sort of way at times.

I find this criticism unfounded.  The little brother has a complete worldview, albeit skewed by his upbringing.  Some of the &#34;gangster&#34; types (both skinhead and black) are rather simple, but this fits with there characters.  They aren't intended to portray criminal masterminds.  They reflect the reality of the average &#34;member.&#34;  People with better options usually find one.  Those who lack the brains to lead or strike out on their own path, follow.  e.g. Our large friend really IS pretty dumb.

This scene is the defining moment of the film and while not being exceptionally bloody onscreen, the implied violence is grotesque. The act is probably witnessed by police coming on scene, he is arrested sent to prison. In prison he finds that black people arent all bad and white supremacists arent all good. When he gets out of jail he tries to rescue his girlfriend and brother from the nazis. This movie has problems staying balanced. The story prior to his arrest builds dramatically until the murders. Once he tries to find safety in prison the movie tries and fails to show exactly what changes his hate. There is an attempt to show a friendship with an inmate but it is shallow, allowing the character to transform by breaks in time rather than soul searching on-screen. Once he is out, his friends and relatives dont understand and wont accept his change, leading to defining moments with his brother, girlfriend and the Neo Nazi leader. Edward Norton is excellent. He shows the dominant personality and aggressiveness needed to make the film realistic. But, the later scenes require more from the supporting cast and they simply arent up to the challenge. The side plots (including the ending) are entirely predictable. Enough so to make the film a dissapointment. There is theme lifted from the Godfather films: redemption is not anough and the price for hate must be paid, so they force a useless tragedy on the film.

33940,ADE852UR9121C,0780625129,perfecto,"[1, 2]","I have heard great things about this movie. My friends raved about it. Critics loved it. And I have always been a fan of Edward Norton. However it was just until recently that I managed to catch this movie, and I was blown away. I was expecting something good, but no way as shocking and powerful as this.Derek was charged with murdering 2 black guys, who were trying to steal his car. He is currently doing time in prison and we are given glimpses of his life before entering prison. He is an influential member of the skinheads. They are a racist group and believe that whites have the sole rights to flourish in the U.S. We are also shown some of the hate crimes committed by Derek and his gang as well as life in prison. These are all in short cuts until they show Derek out of prison and how he sees things differently from then on.First of all, I have to say bravo to the writers and the film makers for making such a bold movie. Whatever movie that deals with racism pales in comparison to this. Derek is not a mindless fool following the crowd. He has his views, his opinions about various problems the country is facing, and scary as this may sound...some of them actually makes sense. That is how profound the dialogue is. One scene in particular showcases this, a scene where the family is having dinner. Derek's mother has a friend over, Murray and they don't share his believes. They are shocked to find Derek has such hatred toward the minorities. Derek delivers some of the best lines in this scene, that you are left wondering...have you ever shared his views? If you did, does that make you a bad person? Is is true what Derek is saying, and if it is...is it fair? These are some of the questions I was left with, watching this movie.As good as the script is, this movie would be nothing without Edward Norton's electrifying performance. Sure, the supporting cast did a fantastic job as well, especially Edward Furlong who played Derek's brother, Danny in the movie. But this movie is undeniably Norton's. I believe that the late 90's was the pinnacle of Norton's success. He gave a superb performance in Primal Fear in 1996, followed by this in 1998 and ending the millennium with outstanding acting in Fight Club in 1999. Here, the character he plays is larger than life. He has the power to change people's perception on crimes and racial views. Putting on 30 pounds of muscle for this role, he has never looked bigger and badder than this. Every move he makes seem to accentuate hate. He feels disgusted with what his neighbourhood has become and he decides to take matters on his own hand, and do something about it. It's just that his believes have been skewed by his father, and without much self control, he spirals down to committing hate crimes. Derek is a bad-a$$ and Norton captures it perfectly. Yet, after prison...Derek experiences something completely different. He has feelings of regret over his past life. He has repent, yet can his sins really be forgiven by him not indulging himself in hate crimes? His brother is headed down the same path and the people who he recruited are now angry with him for leaving that life, they see him as an enemy. How Norton transforms himself to reflect this is really amazing. From a confident, ""don't give a f*ck"" attitude, he is reduced to a broken man. He feels remorse but at the same time doesn't want to shoulder the responsibility of educating his friends the wrong of his ways. He knows it won't sit well with them. This leads to the movie's final scene which suffice to say, might not really have shocked you but will leave you feeling a mixed of emotions.Good movies entertain, but great movies affect you on a personal level. This is an example of the later. This movie is not for everyone, but for those who are open minded and willing to take the leap, you won't be disappointed. Terrific script and brilliant acting makes this one of my favorite movies.

It shows a side of white supremacy and white power organisations we don't hear all that much about (i.e. skinheads) 2. It shows how extreme it can be and how far hate can go.

33946,AJK8D6ELGCX6W,0780625129,"Renee Floyd ""DeliriousPink""","[0, 0]","I watched American History X for the first time about an hour ago. Having already seen a number of Edward Norton films, I expected nothing but brilliance from one of my favourite male actors. But I also knew that Norton, as spectacular of an artist as he is, could not single-handedly conceal the flaws of a less talented team of actors, and certainly not a poor script. I also knew that racism and hate were becoming cliche subjects, and that they have been losing the passion they used to inspire in American audiences. Feeling all these things, I popped the movie into the VCR and watched the film. All the skepticism I had had disappeared long before I reached the end credits.A number of movies about the division of blacks and whites have been made through still prejudiced eyes, glorifying one view or the other. This movie's focus on racism and hate is unlike the others because the perspective we see the characters through changes during the movie. The black man is not pure good or pure evil, and neither is the white man. Rather than pointing out the differences between blacks and whites, the movie made me see only their similar struggles and conflicts, and their similar means of trying to resolve hate through suffering and bloodshed.Also in most movies, there is a distinct line drawn between protagonists and antagonists. American History X is filled with such complex, disturbed, and impressionable characters that it is difficult at times to be sure who is who, ethically speaking. For example, Derek's (Norton's) motivating speeches about white supremacy and illegal immigrants are given with such confidence and leadership that at times, I find myself agreeing with his views. But when he is released from prison a changed man, I understand his newfound disgust with white supremacists, and find myself feeling sympathetic toward Derek. These feelings I have, along with the vulnerability and despair of the characters, make me believe absolutely that people are not born hating each other, rather it is taught by those who have the power to influence people.Along with Edward Norton's wonderful performance, I found Avery Brooks' role to be powerful and authoritative, to such a realistic extreme that I felt guilty whenever his lines were punishing, and reassured whenever his words were comforting. I have decided that Avery Brooks should have had a number of Samuel L. Jackson roles.I guess I'll finish saying this: American History X has the power to force us to question ourselves and the people that influence our lives; to ask ourselves 'Do we believe what our role models are saying because we're truly listening, or are we so blinded by their glowing reputations that we couldn't distinguish right from wrong even if we tried?' There are so many more things I would like to say about how I feel about this movie, but I'd rather let you decide where you stand on things. I will probably write a ten page essay later.",5,Black and White becomes Grey,1028678400,"08 7, 2002",2002,2947,"['watched', 'American', 'History', 'X', 'first', 'time', 'hour', 'ago', 'Having', 'already', 'seen', 'number', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'films', 'expected', 'nothing', 'brilliance', 'one', 'favourite', 'male', 'actors', 'also', 'knew', 'Norton', 'spectacular', 'artist', 'could', 'not', 'single-handedly', 'conceal', 'flaws', 'less', 'talented', 'team', 'actors', 'certainly', 'not', 'poor', 'script', 'also', 'knew', 'racism', 'hate', 'were', 'becoming', 'cliche', 'subjects', 'have', 'been', 'losing', 'passion', 'used', 'inspire', 'American', 'audiences', 'Feeling', 'things', 'popped', 'movie', 'VCR', 'watched', 'film', 'skepticism', 'had', 'had', 'disappeared', 'long', 'reached', 'end', 'credits.A', 'number', 'movies', 'division', 'blacks', 'whites', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'still', 'prejudiced', 'eyes', 'glorifying', 'one', 'view', 'other', 'movie', 'focus', 'racism', 'hate', 'others', 'perspective', 'see', 'characters', 'changes', 'movie', 'black', 'man', 'not', 'pure', 'good', 'pure', 'evil', 'white', 'man', 'Rather', 'pointing', 'out', 'differences', 'blacks', 'whites', 'movie', 'made', 'see', 'only', 'similar', 'struggles', 'conflicts', 'similar', 'means', 'trying', 'resolve', 'hate', 'suffering', 'bloodshed.Also', 'most', 'movies', 'distinct', 'line', 'drawn', 'protagonists', 'antagonists', 'American', 'History', 'X', 'filled', 'such', 'complex', 'disturbed', 'impressionable', 'characters', 'difficult', 'times', 'be', 'sure', 'who', 'who', 'ethically', 'speaking', 'example', 'Derek', 'Norton', 'motivating', 'speeches', 'white', 'supremacy', 'illegal', 'immigrants', 'are', 'given', 'such', 'confidence', 'leadership', 'times', 'find', 'agreeing', 'views', 'when', 'released', 'prison', 'changed', 'man', 'understand', 'newfound', 'disgust', 'white', 'supremacists', 'find', 'feeling', 'sympathetic', 'Derek', 'feelings', 'have', 'vulnerability', 'despair', 'characters', 'make', 'believe', 'absolutely', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'born', 'hating', 'other', 'rather', 'taught', 'who', 'have', 'power', 'influence', 'people.Along', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'found', 'Avery', 'Brooks', 'role', 'be', 'powerful', 'authoritative', 'realistic', 'extreme', 'felt', 'guilty', 'lines', 'were', 'punishing', 'reassured', 'whenever', 'words', 'were', 'comforting', 'have', 'decided', 'Avery', 'Brooks', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'number', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'guess', ""'ll"", 'finish', 'saying', 'American', 'History', 'X', 'power', 'force', 'question', 'people', 'influence', 'lives', 'ask', 'believe', 'what', 'role', 'models', 'are', 'saying', ""'re"", 'truly', 'listening', 'are', 'so', 'blinded', 'glowing', 'reputations', 'could', ""n't"", 'distinguish', 'right', 'wrong', 'even', 'tried', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'more', 'things', 'would', 'like', 'say', 'how', 'feel', 'movie', ""'d"", 'rather', 'let', 'decide', 'where', 'stand', 'things', 'will', 'probably', 'write', 'ten', 'page', 'essay', 'later']",N/A

The primary purpose of this movie is to associate conservative thinking as equal to racist nazi skinheads. In other words republicans are racist. America is racist!Time and again in this film the ed norton character will carry on about main stream political issues such as welfare, immigration or the rodney king incident. He recruits new members by carrying on about illegal immigrants and how much they cost the california tax payer. Is that what these vile racist nuts actually care about? In one clip a particularly disgusting member of their group calls his sister a bleep bleep ""democrat"". His brother later quips his distain for hillary clinton. At a dinner table argument ed norton's mother has a boy friend over; a teacher who happens to be jewish played by elliot gould. The subject is rodney king. Ed norton of course is carrying on about how rodney king deserved to be beaten spouting disgusting racist names. At least two times during the discussion the L word is mentioned in distain. ""Liberal hypocritcal bleep"". Get the picture? Being liberal or democrat is the antithesis of vile racist scum. So a conservative then must be the same. Simple logic and a simple messge according to this movie. This isn't a political agenda? And of course the american flag always is flying high whenever these bigots are carrying on. The flag is there when the norton character explodes in a racist rage about the murder of his his fire fighting father. A few choice words about welfare are included in his out burst. The flag is there when the skinhead nuts get together for their little club parties. The colors of the flag are even there on the coffee mug of the leader of the skinheads. Get the message?There is a second message in this movie. That is that racism is learned so therefore it can be unlearned. This is the redeeming quality of the film. The skin heads are not necessarily that way from the beginning but are manipulated to think that way. Racism has a trigger.

33968,A2Y4MUU6R9NDUR,0780625129,Shotgun Method,"[25, 35]","American History X had a ton of potential to be a really great film, with a powerful anti-racism message and a deep look into the heart of white supremacy in America. What it ends up being is a showcase for Ed Norton's BRILLIANT acting and a movie that appeals more to emotion than to logic and reason, an example of Hollywood politicking gone awry.Take the scene at the dinner table for instance, with white supremacist teen Derek Vinyard getting into a debate with his mother's boyfriend, a Jewish teacher played by Eliot Gould. Many of the points Derek makes in this scene, and throughout the movie (once you strip away the racial slurs and Derek's skinhead image) are scarily, devastating LOGICAL, and often factually correct right down to the statistics.This position is never really given any sort of strong debate throughout the movie. Instead, Tony Kaye prefers to equate right-wing/conservative rhetoric with white supremacists, a cheap and logically flawed shot. Norton's character makes clear and rational arguments against affirmative action and the LA riots, but of course since he's the one with swastika tattoos he's not granted one ounce of credibility. We are expected to believe that if one doesn't buy into the Left's viewpoint on race relations they are automatically vile, contemptible racist pigs, capable of beating their own families and killing in cold blood; strawman reasoning at its worst.The movie expects us to connect the dots, rhetoric with acts of violence (ex. Derek gives speech about illegal immigration from Mexico, then along with his cronies attacks a store run by Asian folks). Racism doesn't necessarily lead to violence; it can be (and often is) a more insidious force. Kaye prefers to beat us over the head with melodramatic constant reminders that ""RACISM IS BAD"" rather than reach past emotion and present us with a stronger, more considered argument.On top of that, Derek's conversion in prison is way too sudden and poorly thought out to be realistic. No skinhead as adamant as Norton's character will suddenly change his tune after having a good-natured conversation with one black man. If anything, the threat of gang rape by the skinhead prisonmates he was once in league with would force Derek to abandon racism for one utilitarian reason; it failed to protect him from abuse. There is not enough of a moral impetus here to make for Derek's transformation into a Gandhi figure.Still despite all this negative baggage, American History X is not without its powerful moments, as it comes with some of the rawest, most shocking violence in cinema history. The brutal scene where Derek murders two black men after they attempt to steal his truck had me cringing*, as did the other scenes of rape and violence strewn throughout the film. I've seen some pretty gory films, but there are few that have made me this uncomfortable to watch. And the idea that racism is a vicious cycle, as Derek's brother Danny (played by Edward Furlong) inherits his brother's Nazi ideals and his former gang, certainly has merit. It also offers an interesting look into the Aryan Youth subculture and what encourages these blue-collar white kids to adopt Neo-Nazism. Too bad American History X doesn't solidify its prescence with a strong logical argument rather than simply playing to emotion and shocking imagery to further its points.* Despite what some other reviewers have said, shooting two men as they are FLEEING and stomping a man's head into a curb is NOT a natural or morally correct defense of one's property--let's be realistic here, that's cold murder.",2,"Hell, good intentions and all that.

The film does not lecture but nor does it pardon - it approaches its delicate subject matter with conviction, maturity and stark imagery.Set among the resurgence of Neo-Nazism among California's disenchanted urban youth in the 80's and early 90's, X is the story of one family, headed by eldest son Norton, and how the seed of racism takes root in his heart and begins to grow.Leading man Norton delivers an explosive and utterly convincing performance as a young man who's world view becomes twisted by racist convictions. Soon his festering and misdirected rage lands him in prison, where hard lessons await. Outside of the prison walls Norton's younger brother begins the cycle anew as he seeks to follow in the footsteps of the brother he has come to idolize.A fascinating and deeply layered tale of prejudice and the painful lessons of lives misspent in its shadow, American History X is explicitly violent but superbly performed and executed. The ending, as shocking as any I've seen in cinema, is as uncompromising as the rest of the film and will provide little comfort to happy-ending seekers.

Apon viewing History, I left with knowing three things: 1)The writing and direction are bar none 2) Edward Norton is still a phenominal actor and 3)American History X is one helluva film.Nazi's are characters which aren't too common in American film. Outside of being plastered by an All American protagonist assult rifle, (or by the Bear Jew's bat) Nazi's are untouched by the cinema. Never before has anyone tried to take a Nazi, a modern day Nazi at that, and turn him into a heroic character. American History X uses this as it's main hook. Edward Norton plays a reformed Neo-Nazi in Venice Beach. After being incarcerated for 3 years in prision, Derek Vinyard (Norton) looks to reform his life and save his brother from the gang life that he lead. Norton's acting in the late 90's was that of legends. AHX catipultes him on a podium of acting that is untouched by the hords of modern day preformers. His acting talents have leaked into other flicks, but with History X and Fight Club, Norton was in rare form, catipulting two revolutionary films even further.Thematically, American History gives a good amount of social commentary where the message is prevelant, but you aren't bashed over the head. Touching on a theme that Unforgiven gave, direcotr Tony Kaye asks us, can forgiveness be an option to a person with such a terrible history? Mixing themes of race, gang life, and redemption, American History message is left blatently open, but is strong and powerful.American History X blew me away. I intially thought X would showcase the downfall of a man with no morals. Instead, I was introduced to a cast of mentally complex characters that grow and evolve. As brutal as it is brilliant, AHX is rated R for good reason. Graphic violence, rape and language is used liberally. It packs as big a punch with adult material is it does with it's message. On the last note, Hollywood once agian takes its stabs at Republicans (although Vinyard is right winged Naxi, he has very educated political opinions), dissapointing me, the ""close minded conservative"".

33974,A3DY46ZABF4CMQ,0780625129,"S. Sarhan ""matured reviewer""","[3, 4]","American History X is a powerful film directed by Tony Kaye, and starring Edward Norton (Fight Club), Edward Furlong (Terminator 2: Judgement Day), and Beverly D'Angelo (National Lampoon's Vacation).The movie is about racism in American society, focusing on a white suburban man named Derek Vinyard, played brilliantly by Norton, who following the death of his father on the hands of a black man, becomes an active member of a white supremacy group led by Cameron Alexander, played by Keach. His ideals are all about ridding their society and ultimately the country from all the immigrants and minority groups who as he believes have infested the good white culture with poverty and struggle in 'their' own land. The events of the film are recollections, shot in black and white, of Derek's younger brother Danny, played by Furlong, who witnessed his older brother murder a black kid outside their home and get arrested. While Derek is in jail, he comes to a realization that everything he stood and fought for was an ill cause, and finally redeems himself; he comes out only to find that his own flesh and blood is following in his footsteps.American History X is a very intriguing movie about redemption, discussing some very delicate and serious issues that are infesting in American society on a daily basis.

33975,A2UW83R0JOZZ6,0780625129,S. Schell,"[7, 10]","It's very hard to put into words how this movie makes me feel, because each and every time I watch it, I am swept away by how powerful and influential it is. Bigotry is an ever-growing boorishness in our society and young Americans are easily induced into believing that one sex or one race is better than the other. It is scary to think that one man alone can be responsible for such wide-spread hatred, but this movie only proves that you need but a few people of similar thinking to spread the word and build your biased militia. The story is told through the eyes of Derek Vinyard's younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong), an impressionable adolescent who idolizes his brother's power of persuasion and blindly consigns to his discriminatory views.Derek (Edward Norton) has reasonable predisposed opinions of African-Americans: his firefighting father was murdered by one of them while sousing a blaze in an impoverished quarter of Venice Beach, California. From the immediate point of this personal tragedy, his vocation is to spread the belief that foreigners and ethnics are given more rights than hard-working, white Protestants and the solution is now in the hands of the victims: themselves. Thus under the headship of well-known white supremacist Cameron Alexander, Derek builds his legion of racist devotees, deftly christening his growing gang of disillusioned teens the &quot;D.O.C.&quot;. The consequences of these beliefs take a powerful impact on his family when he guns down two Crips trying to steal his truck and is incarcerated for three years. During this time, his fledgling organization continues cultivating under the supervision of Cameron whilst Danny is swallowed into the chaos and adheres to Derek's corrupt ideals.Through his junket in a maximum-security prison, his fellow inmate in the laundry happens to be a young black man interned for a false charge of assault. He breaks down the towering wall of stereotypes that surround his race, making Derek realize his beliefs were largely askew and that he had dissapatedly influenced many innocent people, more importantly his brother. As soon as he is paroled, he is on a mission to sway Danny from the neo-Nazi crew that he himself formulated and to unlearn the harmful ethics he so vigorously preached. This proves to be a difficult task as Danny has been completely conditioned by the fascist agenda of the D.O.C., posing a grueling solution: Derek must confront Cameron and confess to Danny the agonizing incident that induced his miraculous epiphany behind bars.Edward Furlong is excellent here, showing there is a deeper acting power lurking in him than such flops as &quot;Brainscan&quot;, &quot;Detroit Rock City&quot; and &quot;Pet Sematary II&quot;. He plays his character with impressive range and doesn't inflate Danny's Nazi disposition to a ridiculous degree and balances his emotional outbursts to an acceptable median. Beverly D'Angelo and newcomer Jennifer Lien turn in top-notch performances as Derek's distraught mother Doris and his educated, fiercely liberal sibling Davina. I have to say I was surprised to see Ethan Suplee as Derek's narrow-minded companion Seth after the bawling dimwit he played in Kevin Smith's critical flop &quot;Mallrats&quot;. Some other famous faces included Stacy Keach as the indomitable Cameron Alexander, Avery Brooks as the laissez-faire counselor Bob Sweeney, and the former Mr. Streisand Eliot Gould as the Jewish boyfriend Murray. Who I was not surprised to see playing the brainwashed girlfriend Stacey is Fairuza Balk, a veteran of such bizarre films as &quot;Return To Oz&quot;, &quot;The Island Of Dr. Moreau&quot; and &quot;The Craft&quot;. She definetely fits the character description with her willingness to buzz her raven locks and wear unattractive appliques to the most noticeable parts of her face. She's one in a million, and I have to say she was wonderful.Who really turns this film and its audience upside down is Edward Norton. A colossal performance anchoring this recycled theme, Edward brings the stereotypical skinhead to life with horrifying realism, pushing the limits with Derek's loutish temperament and blissful ignorance. He spews the Nazi-esque propaganda with nary a flaw or pause, his powerful preaching frightening convincing at times. I found myself nodding my head in agreement in the scene where he complained about &quot;border jumpers&quot; vying for American jobs and the citizens of our country receiving inadequate support in their growing poverty because of invading foreigners. I thought how incredible it was that I had been swayed as easily as his audience of teenagers on these issues, but not on others (believing I am supreme because I'm a Catholic Caucasian). This is a sign of an amazing writer, one who harbors an autocratic power that is channeled through this mesmerizing and credible character.Tony Kaye's artistic brilliance lent this film an emotive and metaphorical leg, curbing the abhorrent pretense with ingenious merit and poetic essence. The black and white segments are purposely applied to convey the mindset of its protaganist. The film finishes with the full-color portions of the beach, suggesting to the audience that everyone (characters and viewers) is illuminated as a result. Many complained that this artsy approach hampered the grisly subject matter, but I think it balanced a delicate scale of mindless violence by reintroducing humanity with our fragile existences. Overall, &quot;American History X&quot; shows us that violence is an infinite circle that traverses far and wide but always comes back to haunt us.",5,Good Vs.

It was a hard hitting, no holds barred drama about a former skinhead trying to turn his life around after three years spent in prison for murder. I believe that this is a movie that  most people should see because of it's extremely powerful portrayal of racism and the consequences of racism. Edward Norton, Edward Furlong, and the rest of the cast give wonderful performances. This film should have been nominated for more Oscars!This is a great film, but one thing is for sure: it is not for the everyone. Please take strong caution before you see this movie. The profanity level is extreme, but it is typical of the environment the characters live in. I can't see how you could accuratly portray this without the excessive profanity. Although I can't stand tons of profanity, I tolerated it in this movie because of the strong subject matter that it dealt with. There was also a rape scene which was graphic and very disturbing, and one strong sexual scene at the beggining. There was graphic violence and lots of blood, but it is also accurate to the subject of the film.This movie portrays the redemption of a man who thought he had screwed his life up forever.

The film centers on a white supremacist in the once-pleasant, now-crime stricken Los Angeles beach enclave of Venice. Edward Norton plays the racist, but the dialogue is sharp and intelligent. While there is no question that Norton is not in the right, and that his racial hatreds have taken him down a perilous personal path, he makes certain biting commentary about race and society that are entirely true and worth agreeing with. Whether the filmmakers wanted whites (and blacks) in the audience nodding in agreement with a guy they would like to show to be a monster is not known. He is charismatic, and intelligent enough to see the light after being stigmatized in prison. With the help of a black teacher, he turns his life around, but sees the damage he has caused to those around him. Heavy-handed political bias cannot be helped.

33983,AYKM1B74OLEVC,0780625129,Story Charts,"[0, 0]","American History X is about the idea that prejudice and bigotry will kill our children. The idea is that prejudice is a slippery slope. A father's offhanded racist remark over the dinner can lead to unintended consequences. The result, in the world of this movie, is children killing each other. The movie makes a pretty convincing argument that the consequences in our world would be just as dire, that there is no room for even a little bit of bigotry in our society if we are to survive without killing each other.American History X goes about proving this idea with two main plots: the internal plot of Derek's redemption from being a skinhead Nazi to a tolerant individual actively helping the good cause and the external plot of Derek's attempt to save his younger brother Danny from the brainwashing that ruined him. Derek is successful in redeeming himself, but his attempt to save Danny fails when Danny is shot and killed. This suggests that even if we live with hate in a momentary weakness, that hate will have consequences far beyond the moment. The movie suggests that with hate, there is no such thing as true redemption. Therefore, we are all well-advised to avoid even a little bit of it.The movie makes the idea fully believable because of the depths of hate and true redemption Derek goes through. He seemed to have finally won the battle to save both his family's soul when his past all of a sudden catches up to him and kills Danny. This twist at the end makes it impossible to finish the movie feeling good about ourselves that the hero has won his redemption through his trials by fire. It makes it impossible not to think and feel and believe that hate will eventually catch up to all of us if we let it in for even a little bit.

If you are affected by ugliness like I am, give it a chance. There is a point to it all.The settings are all great. Even if you've never been in the types of places that are filmed, you get a complete sense of what the neighborhood, school, prison, and party is like. The costumes, hair, and overall look of people is right on.The writing is pretty good. There are times, like at the dinner table scene with the mom's Jewish boyfriend, that the conversation seems contrived, but those moments are few. Usually the dialog moves the story along without ever seeming preachy or fake.The story is unique and fresh. It's not your typical Hollywood movie. It is a biography of a skinhead. It shows the development of his hatred, how his hate contaminated his thinking, his family and his life. Fortunately it ends with his redemption, but it does not come without cost.

Bluray is awesome, the picture quality is so sharp I can see the actors pores on their skin.499 people give this movie 5 stars and i see 29 people give it 2 stars or less, made me try and figure out why, and see from other peoples point of view. Yes this movie is stereotypical, but some stereotypes are true, and some are false. Yes not every young white person is racist, duh. And not all black people commit crimes, duh. etc etc etc. Basically this movie has a deep message that we all face, most people have racist and prejudice  thoughts, but to different degrees. Some are extreme, some are peaceful and theres people in between. We as human carry this deadly virus that can either consume us, or if we choose, cure ourselves and live a happy enlightening life. But like a virus that hides deep wihtin our body, we need to dig down deep to find ourselves first before we can start fighting back for the good. The message this movie is sending cannot be any clearer. ""HATE IS BAGGAGE"". So true.Those people who rated this movie with 2 stars or less have the right to their opinion, but after thinking and pondering, I can only conclude, that they may have some personal issues deep within that they may not want to face, because the truth can hurt you. Just like with anything. Whether you confront and face your fears or the truth, it can set you free. I give this movie 5 stars for 2 reasons, first it does it excellent job entertaining you which is why people watch movies, and secondly, it has a really good message that contributes to improving the quality of life, because after all, white, black, brown, yellow, pink, orange, red, or purple, we are all brothers and sisters one with the universe and until you cannot understand that concept, you will always be a victim of endless suffering caused of your own weakness. ""Hate is baggage"" what a simple yet profound message this movie emphasizes and reminds those who get caught up in the storm of hatred. Hatred is so powerful, is the what will consume life if we as humans let it, one day there will be no earth left, hatred is the most deadliest, potent, evil, dark, form of energy that can completely take over ones mind and change oneself completely. Hatred is so deadly because people under estimate its power over the mind. Yes most people understand the concept of hate, but once it has captured your mind, it is almost impossible to free yourself from it as your mind becomes saturated with such evil.

In prison Derek, (Edward Norton, the  same guy I mentioned earlier obviously) is subjected to the horrors of  prison life, and is reluctant to discover the truths about the wrongs  commited against the Black community and the Hispanic Community, etc.  through working in the laundry department with a black man in for several  years for &quot;resisting arrest&quot; and &quot;assaulting an  officer.&quot;  But it also appears that Derek had always been subjected  to hatred, from his father, from the man he looked up to in the neo-nazi  group, and from everything he'd read on the subject.  Derek, however,  after being released from prison wants to set things straight. He wants to  get his old job back and make sure his brother doesn't get involved in what  he did. However, to do this he needs to confront his old neo-nazi mentor,  and the rest of the hate group that used to look to him as god...  What  is so great about the film is it's strikingly new and original subject  matter. And the awesome use of black-and-white film to signify past events  and normal technicolor for the present. The performances are stellar.  Norton is all too believable as the former skinhead he portrays and almost  is too in character. The supporting cast does a fine job in its role as  well.

Many of these films reveal to be an honest portrayal of the account in which they are trying to explain.  ""American History X"" focuses on the horrors that the root of racism can breed, spreading aimlessly throughout a small California town, and sucking in innocent young adults into a world of fascist and prejudice living.Edward Norton gives the best performance of his young career as a skinead Neo-Nazi who returns from prison to his Venice beach home.  His evolution from a young, bright jock in high school to a thug full of hatred is a rigid, cunning depiction--but the film mainly focuses on his metamorphesis into an enlightened parolee and his relationship with a young brother (played exceptionally well by Edward Furlong, star of ""The Terminator 2: Judgement Day"") who is following in his toxic foosteps.  Director Tony Kaye's vision of how racism ravages a middle-class family is staggering until the last few moments of the motion picture, taking the audience through a whirlwind of events that will shock, disturb, and expose the true nature of hate--and also the strength and courage that it takes to break the chain.Truly one of the most important films of the last decade, ""American History X"" is a bold statement that is not for all--adults and children alike; however, it sends a message and tells a story that should be embraced by all people and is articulate enough with its delivery to create a monsoon of emotion.

His reform happens when he spends his time talking about basketball with his only friend in the laundry room.Yet - I can't completely hate this movie for one reason alone - Edward Norton is one of those actors that is entirely watchable. He can play very nice or very scary and you never know where he's going to go with it. In this movie he's white kid urban rage on all barrels. He's alternately sinister and scary as he explains the tenets of Nazism and makes them sound almost reasonable. Unlike Russel Crowe who has all the intensity but only rage in &lt;b>Romper Stomper&lt;/b> you can see Norton thinking and planning.Sadly he's trapped in a bad plot and that takes away much of the power.

33992,A1LZVU5SRRM3VX,0780625129,Timothy Michael Resh,"[0, 0]","The first few minutes of AHX are intended to horrify and shock you, to show the callousness of people who hate other people simply because of racial or ethnic stereotypes that have been blindly forced upon them.  Edward Norton really shows off his acting chops as he transforms from a bigoted, murderous neo-Nazi to a gentle, rehabilitated older brother trying to prevent his impressionable younger brother (Edward Furlong) from following in his misguided footsteps.The film is both uplifting and tragic, as well as brutally realistic.  Without spoiling the ending for anyone who has not seen the film, Norton's pain and guilt will linger with you long after the credits roll.  Yet from all the tragedy of the hate and violence that consume the characters in this film comes a ray of hope--with the guidance of Dr. Bob Sweeney (played by Avery Brooks) Norton's character, and ultimately Furlong's character, both have small victories in overcoming the cycle of hate.  The ending of the film reminds us, however, that we still have a long way to go in race relations in America.Beverly D'Angelo, Elliot Gould, Stacey Keach, and Fairuz Balk also play convincing supporting roles in this powerful drama that is well worth watching.  Although it is certainly not intended for young children with its violence and graphic rape, AHX is one of those films that should be mandatory for older teens (17-18), especially those who might be pre-disposed to hate a certain religious or ethinic group due to their environment.

His almost maniacal performance is simply astounding. You can see it in his eyes, he takes this role 100% seriously. It truly is probably his best performance to date and surely worthy of the Oscar nomination. I sometimes find him to be understated, but there is no mistaking that in this film. He owns this role and he is the reason to see this film.That said, the film itself is nothing truly innovative or spectacular, the subject matter isn't original or shocking, but it did hook me in regardless. Again, the acting made it believable. The prison scenes were an eye opener, thought a tad on the clich&eacute; side, but I couldn't help but be moved.The ending, for me, almost didn't make any sense in the grand scheme of things, but I think the director ended it exaclty where it was supposed to end.

I think the way in which he portrayed the characters of Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) and Danny Vinyard (Edward Furlong) is close to the best casting job a person could do.Furlong and Norton are able to obtain a perfect amount of love for each other.  Whereas there is enough hate built up inside of the both of them to kill off the entire black community; which is something that is very prevalent in each scene.  There are some very disturbing images in the movie.  For example, when Norton smashes the jaw of the man who breaks into his car (we'll leave it at that) I almost threw up.  And that's the kind of brilliance you should be looking for in a film.  It can't matter whether or not the images or views are gross or even racist, because it's just a movie.  And it's a great one.  Seeing Edward Furlong break out of his ""Detroit Rock City"" bad-ass/photo-taking peckerboy-swagger is enough in itself to make this movie 5 stars.But what really makes this movie so great is its ending.

So, indeed, I sat down to watch it with the expectation of being moved or struck by some conflicting theme that lay within the boiling heart of this movie with the tagline ""Some Legacies Must End"".I was disappointed, and would like to say why.  First of all, I can't malign Edward Norton.  I think that his performance is .. breathtaking, and certainly worth seeing the movie for.  Indeed, I don't say that one shouldn't see this movie.  However, and I won't give away the ending, it's not worth owning.

I hated him every second.However, the plot was lacking.  There was no subtlety, and the characters seemed so one-sided as to almost be farcical ...types of actual people.  The point may have been, in this movie, to provide no subtlety, and to be violent with the plot and imagery, but I think some of that was lost in the intent.  The opening scenes were of a beach or an area like that, with waves slowly lapping in over the sands.  If that was meant to convey some great metaphor, I think I must have missed it.  Flashbacks in black-and-white seemed meaningful, and the character of Derek was intelligent as well as conflicted, but I didn't understand his metamorphosis, and I found it extremely hard to believe that his younger brother would simply .. alter his ways just like that.All in all, I'd only give this movie the three stars on the basis of the strong, strong acting.

You may have thought this would be fairly self-evident but Holywood obviously thinks we need yet another lecture on this subject - and by rights this film should have become yet another clumsily preachy morality play.Edward Norton's astounding performance saved it from this fate. His acting at his best when his character Derek is at his worst. Derek is a troubled teen who turns to neo-Nazism when his fireman father is murdered by black gang members, Derek's powerful oration, lightning sharp mind and leadership skills help propel a group of Hitler-worshipping beach bums into one of the most dangerous gangs in Los Angeles. Delivering his poisonous orations, whether against his mother's Jewish boyfriend or to whip up his followers before assaulting a group of innocent Latino shop workers, Norton imbues Derrick's vitriolic rhetoric with power and just enough truth to make any white liberal squirm. However inside prison Derek finds that truth is no more black and white than skin colour and when he crosses white gang leaders he must depend on a black fellow-inmate to save his life. Derek plays his transformation as well as he is allowed by a clumsy script, with sensititvity and tact.There are some other strong performances in the film, notably from Edward Furlong of Terminator II fame playing Derek's wannabe Nazi younger brother, Fairuza Balk as Derek's wonderfully nasty and unrepentant girlfriend and Guy Torry as the witty, trash-talkin', black petty criminal who saves Derek's life. These are sadly balanced by dreadful overacting by Avery Brooks (Cisco of Deep Space Nine) and Beverly d'Angelo (Ellen Griswold of National Lampoon) as Derek's headmaster and mother respectively.What really lets the film down is the weakness of the 'bad guys' - other than Balk, Norton's fellow gang members are cardboard-cut out stereotypes of red necks and overweight white trash, and the black gang members they fight are equally two-dimensional villains, as are most of Norton's fellow inmates in prison. You can always tell the bad guys - they're fat, obsessed with tattoos and they smoke. This says more about the prejudices of the Holywood wealthy than it does about anything else. Anyone disagreeing with any part of American liberal orthodoxy is also turned into a carboard racist - noticeably Derek's father; obviously not being a committed supporter of affirmative action is just one step away from joining a neo-Nazi gang and murdering innocent people... oh, and all the good guys are English teachers, or want to become English teachers, or are reading serious English literature to transform themselves from evil gang members into good guys.All in all though, there is much more good than bad in this film, and it is well worth watching; by the end I cared enough about the main characters to find the finale genuinely upsetting; it just isn't quite as good as they hype implies.Oh, the cinematography, especially for a relatively low budget film, is beautifully done.",5,2 Dimensional Film Saved By Nortons Acting,1151107200,"06 24, 2006",2006,3213,"['message', 'American', 'History', 'X', 'pretty', 'simple', 'racism', 'bad', 'joining', 'neo-Nazi', 'gang', 'not', 'going', 'solve', 'problems', 'becoming', 'English', 'Literature', 'teacher', 'film', 'actor', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'constructive', 'may', 'have', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'fairly', 'self-evident', 'Holywood', 'obviously', 'need', 'yet', 'lecture', 'subject', 'rights', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'become', 'yet', 'clumsily', 'preachy', 'morality', 'Norton', 'astounding', 'performance', 'saved', 'fate', 'acting', 'best', 'when', 'character', 'Derek', 'worst', 'Derek', 'troubled', 'teen', 'who', 'neo-Nazism', 'when', 'fireman', 'father', 'murdered', 'black', 'gang', 'members', 'Derek', 'powerful', 'oration', 'lightning', 'sharp', 'mind', 'leadership', 'skills', 'help', 'propel', 'group', 'Hitler-worshipping', 'beach', 'bums', 'one', 'most', 'dangerous', 'gangs', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Delivering', 'poisonous', 'orations', 'mother', 'Jewish', 'boyfriend', 'whip', 'up', 'followers', 'assaulting', 'group', 'innocent', 'Latino', 'shop', 'workers', 'Norton', 'Derrick', 'vitriolic', 'rhetoric', 'power', 'just', 'enough', 'truth', 'make', 'white', 'liberal', 'squirm', 'However', 'prison', 'Derek', 'truth', 'more', 'black', 'white', 'skin', 'colour', 'when', 'white', 'gang', 'leaders', 'must', 'depend', 'black', 'fellow-inmate', 'save', 'life', 'Derek', 'transformation', 'as', 'well', 'allowed', 'clumsy', 'script', 'sensititvity', 'are', 'other', 'strong', 'performances', 'film', 'notably', 'Edward', 'Furlong', 'Terminator', 'II', 'fame', 'playing', 'Derek', 'wannabe', 'Nazi', 'younger', 'brother', 'Fairuza', 'Balk', 'Derek', 'wonderfully', 'nasty', 'unrepentant', 'girlfriend', 'Guy', 'Torry', 'witty', 'trash-talkin', 'black', 'petty', 'criminal', 'who', 'Derek', 'life', 'are', 'sadly', 'balanced', 'dreadful', 'overacting', 'Avery', 'Brooks', 'Cisco', 'Deep', 'Space', 'Nine', 'Beverly', ""d'Angelo"", 'Ellen', 'Griswold', 'National', 'Lampoon', 'Derek', 'headmaster', 'mother', 'respectively.What', 'really', 'film', 'down', 'weakness', ""'bad"", 'guys', 'other', 'Balk', 'Norton', 'fellow', 'gang', 'members', 'are', 'cardboard-cut', 'stereotypes', 'red', 'necks', 'overweight', 'white', 'trash', 'black', 'gang', 'members', 'fight', 'are', 'equally', 'two-dimensional', 'villains', 'are', 'most', 'Norton', 'fellow', 'inmates', 'prison', 'can', 'always', 'tell', 'bad', 'guys', ""'re"", 'fat', 'obsessed', 'tattoos', 'smoke', 'more', 'prejudices', 'Holywood', 'wealthy', 'anything', 'else', 'Anyone', 'disagreeing', 'part', 'American', 'liberal', 'orthodoxy', 'also', 'turned', 'carboard', 'racist', 'noticeably', 'Derek', 'father', 'obviously', 'not', 'being', 'committed', 'supporter', 'affirmative', 'action', 'just', 'one', 'step', 'away', 'joining', 'neo-Nazi', 'gang', 'murdering', 'innocent', 'people', 'oh', 'good', 'guys', 'are', 'English', 'teachers', 'want', 'become', 'English', 'teachers', 'are', 'reading', 'serious', 'English', 'literature', 'transform', 'evil', 'gang', 'members', 'good', 'guys.All', 'much', 'more', 'good', 'bad', 'film', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'end', 'cared', 'enough', 'main', 'characters', 'find', 'finale', 'genuinely', 'upsetting', 'just', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'hype', 'implies.Oh', 'cinematography', 'especially', 'relatively', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'beautifully', 'done']",N/A

The story is about how Derek (Norton) turned into a racist and then back into a non-racist under the influence of his father and his jail-mates respectively. And it's also about how his brother Daniel molded himself into another racist Derek. Some of the scenes are very powerful, especially the one where Derek killed a black man and then got arrested. Senses of hate, cruelty, violence and defiance are all very effectively expressed by the slow black-&amp;-white series of images of Norton displaying the swastika tattoo on his naked muscular chest. But this comprehensive representation of racism is unfortunately not matched by the subsequent plot development where Derek came to regret about what he'd done. The eariler expression of racism is so powerful that the later less successful projection of the transformed Derek pales in comparison. Overall, however, it is a movie that would leave a lasting impression with the viewers. Viewers may not agree with the way the movie handled such a sensitive topic, but it in any case has succeeded in bringing us a strong visual sensation of racism.

With an amazing cast, and powerful story line, it's all but impossible to walk away from this movie unmoved and with eyes unopened",4,AMX,1095120000,"09 14, 2004",2004,587,"['American', 'History', 'X', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'gripping', 'dramas', 'ever', 'made', 'story', 'tragedy', 'hate', 'ignorance', 'sides', 'black/white', 'racial', 'boundary', 'Narrated', 'posthumously', 'Daniel', 'Vinyard', 'story', 'hate', 'white', 'supremicist', 'Derrick', 'Vinyard', 'how', 'hate', 'rips', 'not', 'only', 'world', 'family', 'apart', 'as', 'well', 'movie', 'excellent', 'job', 'driving', 'home', 'old', 'adage', 'what', 'around', 'around', 'amazing', 'cast', 'powerful', 'story', 'line', 'impossible', 'walk', 'away', 'movie', 'unmoved', 'eyes', 'unopened']",N/A

It was -- both quality and disturbing. I have never seen Norton anything but excellent in any role, my expectations of him were high, and he fully met and surpassed those expectations. Indeed, this is one of his best, and I can understand why he was nominated for an Oscar based on his performance in AHX.""American History X"" portrays a young man turned into a neo-Nazi when his father, a man he unquestioningly idolizes as so many young sons do their fathers, is murdered. His father, a racist police officer, plants a seed of racism in his son's mind shortly before his death, and with the bloody fertilization of a brutal murder, the seed produces a young man filled with hatred and rage, seeking to spill blame on those different than himself. What makes Norton's character of Derek Vinyard so horrifying and plausible is his intelligence. This is not a person who swallows a prejudice whole. He turns it into a philosophy of life, and it is only when his rage flames out of control that we can see how dangerous his views are, how far reaching the hatred. Culminating in two murders that chill to the bone, Derek Vinyard is imprisoned. Outside of those prison walls, his younger brother, played also with exceptional skill by Edward Furlong, yet another boy who idolizes his older sibling, continues on the path Derek has blazed. Inside the prison walls, Derek Vinyard undergoes a harsh lesson of humility coupled with the kindness of an expected enemy that he finally realizes has saved him. Few things teach better than pain. Most lessons in life are learned best when we hit bottom. Derek Vinyard hits bottom hard, but it is the kindness of those he had seen as enemies that provides now the balm of human compassion that helps him complete his inner growth. He emerges from prison a changed man. Life is not so neat, however, and the seeds of hatred he has sown in prior years must yet travel their full course.To change a man's heart is a difficult feat. To transform hatred and rage into wisdom and compassion happens rarely, too rarely. But Norton makes this transformation of a man's heart ring true. The movie stands as a powerful statement of the possibilities of changing evil into good, of waking a spirit seemingly lost to hatred to the grace of love in what becomes a true hero: the man who was once fallen, who grows through his pain, and becomes a  man able to stand up for what takes true courage - doing the right thing.The only flat performance in AHX is by Stacy Keach, who plays the guru of the Nazi movement. He is unable to pop out of his one dimensional character. But all other performances in this movie, notably also Beverly D'Angelo's potrayal of Derek's mother, are first class. However uncomfortable some of the graphic scenes in this movie, it is a must see.",5,Courage to Change,1069372800,"11 21, 2003",2003,3003,"['recommendations', 'several', 'friends', 'combined', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'being', 'lead', 'role', 'American', 'History', 'X', 'settled', 'what', 'suspected', 'would', 'be', 'disturbing', 'quality', 'movie', 'evening', 'was', 'quality', 'disturbing', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'Norton', 'anything', 'excellent', 'role', 'expectations', 'were', 'high', 'fully', 'met', 'surpassed', 'expectations', 'Indeed', 'one', 'best', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'based', 'performance', 'AHX', 'American', 'History', 'X', 'young', 'man', 'turned', 'neo-Nazi', 'when', 'father', 'man', 'unquestioningly', 'so', 'many', 'young', 'sons', 'do', 'fathers', 'murdered', 'father', 'racist', 'police', 'officer', 'plants', 'seed', 'racism', 'son', 'mind', 'shortly', 'death', 'bloody', 'fertilization', 'brutal', 'murder', 'seed', 'young', 'man', 'filled', 'hatred', 'rage', 'seeking', 'spill', 'blame', 'different', 'What', 'Norton', 'character', 'Derek', 'Vinyard', 'horrifying', 'plausible', 'intelligence', 'not', 'person', 'who', 'prejudice', 'whole', 'philosophy', 'life', 'only', 'when', 'rage', 'control', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'dangerous', 'views', 'are', 'how', 'far', 'reaching', 'hatred', 'Culminating', 'two', 'murders', 'chill', 'bone', 'Derek', 'Vinyard', 'imprisoned', 'prison', 'walls', 'younger', 'brother', 'played', 'also', 'exceptional', 'skill', 'Edward', 'Furlong', 'yet', 'boy', 'who', 'older', 'sibling', 'path', 'Derek', 'blazed', 'prison', 'walls', 'Derek', 'Vinyard', 'harsh', 'lesson', 'humility', 'coupled', 'kindness', 'expected', 'enemy', 'finally', 'saved', 'Few', 'things', 'teach', 'better', 'pain', 'Most', 'lessons', 'life', 'are', 'learned', 'best', 'when', 'hit', 'bottom', 'Derek', 'Vinyard', 'bottom', 'hard', 'kindness', 'had', 'seen', 'enemies', 'now', 'balm', 'human', 'compassion', 'complete', 'inner', 'growth', 'prison', 'changed', 'man', 'Life', 'not', 'so', 'neat', 'however', 'seeds', 'hatred', 'sown', 'prior', 'years', 'must', 'yet', 'travel', 'full', 'course.To', 'change', 'man', 'heart', 'difficult', 'feat', 'transform', 'hatred', 'rage', 'wisdom', 'compassion', 'happens', 'rarely', 'too', 'rarely', 'Norton', 'transformation', 'man', 'heart', 'ring', 'true', 'movie', 'powerful', 'statement', 'possibilities', 'changing', 'evil', 'good', 'waking', 'spirit', 'seemingly', 'lost', 'hatred', 'grace', 'love', 'what', 'true', 'hero', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'once', 'fallen', 'who', 'pain', 'man', 'able', 'stand', 'up', 'what', 'true', 'courage', 'doing', 'right', 'thing.The', 'only', 'flat', 'performance', 'AHX', 'Stacy', 'Keach', 'who', 'guru', 'Nazi', 'movement', 'unable', 'pop', 'one', 'dimensional', 'character', 'other', 'performances', 'movie', 'notably', 'also', 'Beverly', ""D'Angelo"", 'potrayal', 'Derek', 'mother', 'are', 'first', 'class', 'However', 'uncomfortable', 'graphic', 'scenes', 'movie', 'must', 'see']",N/A
