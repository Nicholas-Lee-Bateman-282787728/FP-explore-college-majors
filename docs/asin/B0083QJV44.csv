1545292,A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,B0083QJV44,"Christopher Barrett ""Evil Corgi""","[3, 4]","Granted it's selling for lower than the MSRP of $60 ($36 currently), but it's still tough to swallow, especially after watching it less than a year ago for free on Crunchyroll. And I remember the old days of anime when I was paying $9.99 for 3-4 episodes on VHS. But with the quantity of anime from Funimation and Sentai being sold at $50-60 for 24 episodes, it's tough to cough up the high price per episode for a series such as this one, which is really a watch once kind of series.***Note - the four star rating has NOTHING to do with the price. Please read on.***The series is VERY GOOD, just NOT GREAT in my opinion. The premise is sound, but it seems that 11 episodes were too little to really capture everything. It was based on a 9 volume novel series for crying out loud! So in trying to fit nine volumes of literature into 275 minutes of anime, one can notice that there are gaps in the story. Especially in the last two episodes things seem overly rushed and incomplete. I really liked the inclusion of the Shakespeare references too!In the series, Shion is growing up in the utopia called No. 6. He shelters a boy named Nezumi (Japanese for rat) and this leads him into a whole heap of trouble. Shion and his mother lose their privileged status and are forced to move into the suburbs. Four years later, through a chance encounter (is it really a 'chance' encounter one wonders) Nezumi takes Shion outside of No. 6 and opens his eyes to the real world beyond. Shion discovers that there is much beneath the surface of the utopia, including medical experimentation on the citizens, totalitarian rule, and oppressive peacekeepers.Really the whole problem is that they only made 11 episodes. The characters are interesting but don't have time to fully develop, at least not to the extent one would hope. The final two episodes seem rushed and the conclusion, while fitting, is kind of forgetful. When the last episode ended I was thinking ""That's it?""Animation is very good quality, on par with some of Gonzo's works. The Japanese language cast is very good. I haven't listened to an English dub, so I cannot comment on that. Music is decent, though not exceptional. The story is great and very interesting, just pared down quite a bit from the novels.Overall a good series, but perhaps worthy of watching first if you have access to episodes via Netflix or another streaming service. If it were pushed down to $22 (or $2 per episode) then I would heartily recommend a purchase. At this point, buy if you really like it, I'm just glad that personally, I was able to watch first.For this style of anime, I feel Ergo Proxy, Now and Then Here and There, Last Exile, and Shangri-La are better for re-watching. This is a good series to at least watch once. I just don't think I would really get much more from subsequent views.",4,"A good series, good for a viewing, not really worth owning~",1345593600,"08 22, 2012",2012,2831,"['Granted', 'selling', 'lower', 'MSRP', '60', '36', 'currently', 'still', 'tough', 'swallow', 'especially', 'watching', 'less', 'year', 'ago', 'free', 'Crunchyroll', 'remember', 'old', 'days', 'anime', 'when', 'was', 'paying', '9.99', '3-4', 'episodes', 'VHS', 'quantity', 'anime', 'Funimation', 'Sentai', 'being', 'sold', '50-60', '24', 'episodes', 'tough', 'cough', 'up', 'high', 'price', 'episode', 'series', 'such', 'one', 'really', 'watch', 'once', 'kind', 'series', '***Note', 'four', 'star', 'rating', 'NOTHING', 'do', 'price', 'Please', 'read', '***The', 'series', 'VERY', 'GOOD', 'just', 'NOT', 'GREAT', 'opinion', 'premise', 'sound', '11', 'episodes', 'were', 'too', 'little', 'really', 'capture', 'everything', 'was', 'based', '9', 'volume', 'novel', 'series', 'crying', 'out', 'loud', 'So', 'trying', 'fit', 'nine', 'volumes', 'literature', '275', 'minutes', 'anime', 'one', 'can', 'notice', 'are', 'gaps', 'story', 'Especially', 'last', 'two', 'episodes', 'things', 'seem', 'overly', 'rushed', 'incomplete', 'really', 'liked', 'inclusion', 'Shakespeare', 'references', 'too', 'series', 'Shion', 'growing', 'up', 'utopia', 'called', 'No', '6', 'boy', 'named', 'Nezumi', 'Japanese', 'rat', 'whole', 'heap', 'trouble', 'Shion', 'mother', 'lose', 'privileged', 'status', 'are', 'forced', 'move', 'suburbs', 'Four', 'years', 'later', 'chance', 'encounter', 'really', ""'chance"", 'encounter', 'one', 'wonders', 'Nezumi', 'Shion', 'No', '6', 'eyes', 'real', 'world', 'Shion', 'much', 'surface', 'utopia', 'including', 'medical', 'experimentation', 'citizens', 'totalitarian', 'rule', 'oppressive', 'peacekeepers.Really', 'whole', 'problem', 'only', 'made', '11', 'episodes', 'characters', 'are', 'interesting', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'fully', 'develop', 'least', 'not', 'extent', 'one', 'would', 'hope', 'final', 'two', 'episodes', 'seem', 'rushed', 'conclusion', 'fitting', 'kind', 'forgetful', 'When', 'last', 'episode', 'ended', 'was', 'thinking', 'Animation', 'very', 'good', 'quality', 'par', 'Gonzo', 'works', 'Japanese', 'language', 'cast', 'very', 'good', 'have', ""n't"", 'listened', 'English', 'dub', 'can', 'not', 'comment', 'Music', 'decent', 'not', 'exceptional', 'story', 'great', 'very', 'interesting', 'just', 'pared', 'down', 'quite', 'bit', 'novels.Overall', 'good', 'series', 'perhaps', 'worthy', 'watching', 'first', 'have', 'access', 'episodes', 'Netflix', 'streaming', 'service', 'were', 'pushed', 'down', '22', '2', 'episode', 'then', 'would', 'heartily', 'recommend', 'purchase', 'point', 'buy', 'really', ""'m"", 'just', 'glad', 'personally', 'was', 'able', 'watch', 'first.For', 'style', 'anime', 'feel', 'Ergo', 'Proxy', 'Now', 'Then', 'Here', 'Last', 'Exile', 'Shangri-La', 'are', 'better', 're-watching', 'good', 'series', 'least', 'watch', 'once', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'really', 'get', 'much', 'more', 'subsequent', 'views']",No. 6: The Complete Collection
1545293,A2U4TBSL80X26Y,B0083QJV44,Jim,"[0, 0]","Although the premise and characters are not entirely original, I grew quite fond of No. 6 and its off center method of telling a story that makes us ask ourselves tough questions. The show started off as most similar stories do with the sweeping exaggeration of the greatness of the utopia that is No. 6 juxtaposed against the desperation of one of the protagonists struggle to escape the clutches of its oppression. Out of all of these warmed over undertones of a rotten prison lurking within paradise emerge touching relationships and believable characters with very real motivations and emotional struggles.While I would not categorize any of the characters or concepts in this series as original (especially not Nezumi, who is almost an exact copy of Saotome Alto from Macross Frontier) I am highly impressed by the storytelling and synthesis of all of these elements to form a very unique work that, in my humble opinion, delivers powerful messages and encourages us to question the world around us.Until the last two episodes, the animation is excellent, and even after the drop off in animation quality that is evident in the final two episodes, it never takes away from the experience to any measurable degree. The ending is simultaneously highly satisfying and somewhat open ended forcing you to trust in the characters that guided you through the story (that's a good thing in my opinion).Overall, if you have not seen this diamond in the rough you should most certainly view it. While not perfect, it is quite memorable and thought provoking and certainly worthy of 11 episodes of viewing time.",4,Memorable and touching!,1381104000,"10 7, 2013",2013,1605,"['premise', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'entirely', 'original', 'grew', 'quite', 'fond', 'No', '6', 'off', 'center', 'method', 'telling', 'story', 'ask', 'tough', 'questions', 'show', 'started', 'off', 'most', 'similar', 'stories', 'do', 'sweeping', 'exaggeration', 'greatness', 'utopia', '6', 'juxtaposed', 'desperation', 'one', 'protagonists', 'struggle', 'escape', 'clutches', 'oppression', 'warmed', 'undertones', 'rotten', 'prison', 'lurking', 'paradise', 'emerge', 'touching', 'relationships', 'believable', 'characters', 'very', 'real', 'motivations', 'emotional', 'struggles.While', 'would', 'not', 'categorize', 'characters', 'concepts', 'series', 'original', 'especially', 'not', 'Nezumi', 'who', 'almost', 'exact', 'copy', 'Saotome', 'Alto', 'Macross', 'Frontier', 'am', 'highly', 'impressed', 'storytelling', 'synthesis', 'elements', 'form', 'very', 'unique', 'work', 'humble', 'opinion', 'delivers', 'powerful', 'messages', 'question', 'world', 'last', 'two', 'episodes', 'animation', 'excellent', 'even', 'drop', 'off', 'animation', 'quality', 'evident', 'final', 'two', 'episodes', 'never', 'away', 'experience', 'measurable', 'degree', 'ending', 'simultaneously', 'highly', 'satisfying', 'somewhat', 'open', 'ended', 'forcing', 'trust', 'characters', 'guided', 'story', 'good', 'thing', 'opinion', '.Overall', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'diamond', 'rough', 'should', 'most', 'certainly', 'view', 'not', 'perfect', 'quite', 'memorable', 'thought', 'provoking', 'certainly', 'worthy', '11', 'episodes', 'viewing', 'time']",No. 6: The Complete Collection
1545294,AMYSV3PZLNDCS,B0083QJV44,Just some old guy.,"[3, 5]","Civilization,for the most part, live in walled cities. Life is good in the cities, you have all the luxuries you could hope for. It was a dark and stormy night and young teen is out on the balcony screaming to vent. In the woods his voice is heard by another whom is not much older. This other person is wounded and manages to enter trough the balcony. It turns out that this wounded person aka Rat is a fugitive.I will not tell you all that happens but after dressing his wounds the two develop a friendship. Rat explains that he lives outside the city and that what the residents of the city are told and what reality is are two different things.Time passes and Rat reappears and now saves the teens life.  At Rats side he leaves all & everyone that he has known and if he returns he will be killed. No longer in the lap of luxury his eyes are opened to the horrors that comes with living outside the city.These are not stand alone episodes so it plays like a movie and since this is not out yet I can say anything about the extras that will be on the disc.There is much, much more to this story but that is the premises. How do you right such a terrible injustice to those outside the city? What difference can two people make?My feeble explanation does not do the show justice. Will I but this show...yes,but more around the 30-40 dollar range.I can not say ""You should buy this"" or ""this is the best I've seen""...etc. I can tell you it was good show, just over 4 stars. Animation is good from start to finish and ranges from average to slightly above. This story moves forward from start to finish and never gets bogged down. There is blood but nothing over the top. Some of the shows that I like are Broken Blade..Black Blood Brothers..Corpse Princess...Steins Gate...When They Cry...Claymore...Trinity Blood..Deadman Wonderland...etc. If you like some of those then you should enjoy this...I streamed it via Crunchyroll.",4,It was a dark & stormy night.....,1338595200,"06 2, 2012",2012,1927,"['Civilization', 'most', 'part', 'live', 'walled', 'cities', 'Life', 'good', 'cities', 'have', 'luxuries', 'could', 'hope', 'was', 'dark', 'stormy', 'night', 'young', 'teen', 'out', 'balcony', 'screaming', 'vent', 'woods', 'voice', 'heard', 'whom', 'not', 'much', 'older', 'other', 'person', 'wounded', 'enter', 'balcony', 'out', 'wounded', 'person', 'aka', 'Rat', 'fugitive.I', 'will', 'not', 'tell', 'dressing', 'wounds', 'two', 'develop', 'friendship', 'Rat', 'city', 'what', 'residents', 'city', 'are', 'told', 'what', 'reality', 'are', 'two', 'different', 'things.Time', 'passes', 'Rat', 'reappears', 'now', 'teens', 'life', 'Rats', 'side', 'everyone', 'known', 'will', 'be', 'killed', 'No', 'longer', 'lap', 'luxury', 'eyes', 'are', 'opened', 'horrors', 'living', 'city.These', 'are', 'not', 'stand', 'alone', 'episodes', 'movie', 'not', 'yet', 'can', 'say', 'anything', 'extras', 'will', 'be', 'disc.There', 'much', 'much', 'more', 'story', 'premises', 'How', 'do', 'right', 'terrible', 'injustice', 'city', 'What', 'difference', 'can', 'two', 'people', 'make', 'feeble', 'explanation', 'not', 'do', 'show', 'justice', 'Will', 'show', 'yes', 'more', '30-40', 'dollar', 'range.I', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'should', 'buy', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'etc', 'can', 'tell', 'was', 'good', 'show', 'just', '4', 'stars', 'Animation', 'good', 'start', 'finish', 'average', 'slightly', 'above', 'story', 'forward', 'start', 'finish', 'never', 'bogged', 'down', 'blood', 'nothing', 'top', 'shows', 'like', 'are', 'Broken', 'Blade..Black', 'Blood', 'Brothers..Corpse', 'Princess', 'Gate', 'When', 'Cry', 'Claymore', 'Trinity', 'Blood..Deadman', 'Wonderland', 'etc', 'like', 'then', 'should', 'enjoy', 'streamed', 'Crunchyroll']",No. 6: The Complete Collection
