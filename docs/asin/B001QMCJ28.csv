However, they soon discover a video of a young boy that resembles their son taken from a small village in Burma, and they set off using any means necessary to bring back their child. A blaring title sequence opens VINYAN with an air of pretension that is carried on throughout the rest of the picture. Frabrice du Welz' English-language premiere is light on character, but heavy on aesthetic and atmosphere. The eerie psychological-thriller follows a similar plot progression to Francis Ford Coppola's APOCALYPSE NOW, traveling deep into the misty jungles and deeper into the darkest recesses of the human mind. Welz' camera goes into all-wheel-drive as it tears through the jungle paths and splashes into the sea right alongside each of the characters in a rough but calculated shooting style. Although Emmanuelle Beart and Rufus Sewell provide strong performances, their portrayals of the distant Jeanne and reactionary Paul garner little support in their hunt for their missing son. VINYAN's spooky settings and frightening look at human trafficking make for a unique watch, but the thin plotting and vague ending will leave many viewers wanting more.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",3,Vinyan,1287360000,"10 18, 2010",2010,1288,"['Hope', 'seemed', 'be', 'lost', 'Bellmers', 'son', 'was', 'washed', 'away', 'tsunami', 'Indonesia', 'However', 'soon', 'discover', 'video', 'young', 'boy', 'son', 'taken', 'small', 'village', 'Burma', 'set', 'off', 'using', 'means', 'necessary', 'bring', 'back', 'child', 'blaring', 'title', 'sequence', 'VINYAN', 'air', 'pretension', 'carried', 'rest', 'picture', 'Frabrice', 'du', 'Welz', 'English-language', 'premiere', 'light', 'character', 'heavy', 'aesthetic', 'atmosphere', 'eerie', 'psychological-thriller', 'similar', 'plot', 'progression', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'APOCALYPSE', 'NOW', 'traveling', 'deep', 'misty', 'jungles', 'deeper', 'darkest', 'recesses', 'human', 'mind', 'Welz', 'camera', 'all-wheel-drive', 'jungle', 'paths', 'splashes', 'sea', 'right', 'characters', 'rough', 'calculated', 'shooting', 'style', 'Emmanuelle', 'Beart', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'provide', 'strong', 'performances', 'portrayals', 'distant', 'Jeanne', 'reactionary', 'Paul', 'garner', 'little', 'support', 'hunt', 'missing', 'son', 'VINYAN', 'spooky', 'settings', 'frightening', 'look', 'human', 'trafficking', 'make', 'unique', 'watch', 'thin', 'plotting', 'vague', 'ending', 'will', 'leave', 'many', 'viewers', 'wanting', 'more.-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",Vinyan

Christopher Blackshere ""Mackshere""","[23, 27]","VINYANA spirit consumed by rage and confusion after being horribly stripped from the clutches of mortality._________________________________INTRODUCTIONA dismal, overwhelming sense of hopelessness resonates through every frame of this riveting mind-bender.  I was a little shocked to catch this at a private screening during Fangoria's Weekend of Horrors.  This movie might put your average gorehound to sleep, as the blood and guts spewage is pretty non-existent.  But VINYAN has an unbelievably black tone, such a disturbing descent into madness that will leave you feeling completely drained and lifeless._________________________________CAST & CREW*Lead actor--Rufus Sewell (Dark City)*Lead actress--Emmanuelle Beart (Mission:Impossible)*Director--Fabrice du Welz (Calvaire)*Cinematographer--Benoit Debie (Irreversible)_________________________________STORYJeanne and Paul are an American couple working in Thailand.  They are totally ravaged by the loss of their son Joshua, who was swept away in the Southeast Asia Tsunami.  His body was never found, which left them a tiny glimmer of hope of his survival.Six months later at a charity fundraiser, they see a video of orphans living in the jungles of Burma.  They catch a glimpse of a boy that resembles their lost child, and Jeanne becomes obsessed with searching for him.Their treacherous journey sends them on an ill-fated quest through the jungle, led by dangerous human trafficers._________________________________ACTINGThe two stars do a phenomenal job, very controlled and convincing.  Beart especially, she completely delves into this role and is totally fearless.  The final scene is so unbelievably shocking, I still can't fathom her putting herself through it.  The MPAA no doubt would disapprove.  A-_________________________________CINEMATOGRAPHYSome very spooky shots, very stylistic and engrossing.  Some resemble the shots from IRREVERSIBLE, in the Rectum club.  Along with the sounds, the shots set a very tense atmosphere.  Plus there are hallucinations and drunken dreams that capture the desperation quite well.  There are shots underwater, shots with a hand-held camera that were totally impressive.  A+_________________________________DIRECTIONDu Welz did an amazing job with his first English-dialogue film.  This isn't a story that will have a broad appeal, but he poured his heart into it.  He does well capturing the emotional upheaval of the characters.  He doesn't fall into the temptation of adding cheap scares to appease the casual moviegoers.  Some might have issues with the pacing.  I was leery as the climax drew near, realizing that there was no satisfying way to end this story.  Somehow, thankfully, he proved me wrong.

At first the suspense of trying to find their child was intense but as the film progressed, I gradually lost interest in whether they would find their child since it started to become very tedious watching them slough the mud and losing their connections.  I looked at the ""Special Features"" and though it may have been pleasurable for the actors, this viewer was left in the lurch.

Wilson ""SonRisedInTheEast""","[2, 4]","Allow me to save several of you some time right off the bat by warning that if you're on the hunt for a legitimate horror movie-- look elsewhere immediately.  Vinyan is a plodding and artistic drama about loss, regret, and... well, whatever you want to categorize the finale as(revenge maybe?), but it's NOT horror.  It's well made, with some gloomy atmosphere and excellent cinematography, even a few(and by few I mean EXACTLY 3) creepy moments, but it's NOT horror.  The story follows a pair of grieving parents on the hunt for the son they lost 6 months prior to a tsunami in Thailand.  To do this they enlist the help of a criminal, who for 1.5 million, guarantee's he can find they're son.  From this point forward they travel to various secluded jungle locations while continually being monetarily sucked dry.  The bleak ending is shocking only to those that actually think travelling to remote foreign islands with criminals is a ""great idea.""  It may seem at this point that my low rating for Vinyan is due to the disappointment of it being something other than I expected... but actually, even reviewed as a drama it left much to be desired(unless you're fellow reviewer Christopher Blackshere of course LOL!).

1231215,A328S9RN3U5M68,B001QMCJ28,Grady Harp,"[8, 13]","VINYAN (apparently meaning 'drifting souls') is a film that calls for stamina and courage just to sit through it.  The story is so meager, related by an ill-composed, repetitive script (Oliver Blackburn and director Fabrice Du Welz), that the only reason to not turn off the DVD after the first 10 minutes is the hope that the fine actors  Emmanuelle B&eacute;art and Rufus Sewell might make something of the simplistic idea.  They don't.A couple (B&eacute;art and Sewell) lives in Thailand recovering from the loss of their only son Joshua in a tsunami.  A video observed at a fundraiser seems to show (at least in the mother's mind) the presence of a still alive Joshua in a jungle in Burma.  From that point the sole line of the story is the misfortunes the couple endure on a scam riddled journey to Burma to find their son.  The ending involves a mountain of special effects and dreary children in silly makeup who supposedly represent the 'vinyan' of the title.  The ending is one of gore and titillation in very bad taste.  This movie is one to 'pass' when selecting DVDs form the local shelves.

The premise is very intersting and I'm a fan of Rufus Sewell. The only thing scary about this film was how boring it was.  The director lingers way too long on scenes with no dialogue and random images.  Possibly to make up for the total lack of story or characters to care about.  I kept waiting for the film to pick-up and do something that made sense.  One thing that would have made sense is for the lead male character to leave his crazy, pouty-mouthed wife in the jungle to talk to the trees. But alas, we're expected to believe that a pampered European couple could wander aimlessly through the jungles of Southwast Asia without running into anything worse than a pack of children with pointy sticks.

All of these films, Vinyan included, are insidiously well crafted pieces of cinema that pack a nasty punch; great performances, solid storylines, and cleverly orchestrated horror.The story concerns a couple devastated by the loss of their son 6 months earlier, the wife moreso than the husband. They essentially head off on a wild goosechase to find the kind in Burma once the wife starts obessing over footage that leads her to believe the kid survived the tsunami that supposedly claimed his life.As their search begins to go horribly, horribly wrong, both start to crack, and some bizarre things start to happen.

1231222,APOUYO1BEPK22,B001QMCJ28,"M. B Cole ""Kegrun""","[9, 16]","Paul Belhmer (Rufus Sewell) and Janet Belhmer (Emmanuelle B&eacute;art) are parents who tragically lost their son in a tsunami six months ago. Lost as in lost, not as in dead. There was no evidence that their son was dead. Then one day, while at a charity event, they were shown a video of the poor and the helpless in Thailand. In the video, Janet believes she sees her lost son. She convinces Paul that they must do whatever they can to find that spot and find their son. Since the couple are English speaking Americans (I think), their journey to an unsafe location of Thailand is anything but easy. Lies, trickery, and heart-ache await for them on the search for their son.Wow. I could not believe how bored I was through out this movie. Wasn't even fun to watch with a friend and joke around kind of movie either. ""OH GOD PLEASE JUST END"" was probably shouted about 40 times between the two of us watching. It all started with the beginning credits. A lot of the words were turned sideways to be, I don't know, cool? Annoying right away. Then after the credits we see someone's J-Horror type black hair underwater for around 2 minutes with a very loud wave crashing static type of noise. I almost wanted to throw up it was so annoying. My friend started screaming ""WHY WONT IT STOP!!!"" I honestly fast forwarded through it because it just wouldn't stop. Then the movie FINALLY beings with big hipped Emmanuelle B&eacute;art walking out of the water. Ok here we go...now it's time for spooky stuff to begin soon. Charity event happens...we see video...we see what might be their son. Ok off we go. Gotta find the kid. Everything is going smooth...and then I get aggravated again. Daddy has to pay this guy 1.5 million to get a boat ride to find his son. I scream out ""Yen?!"" because seriously he got 1.5 million to pay this guy in like hours. Ok...just let it goes...it's a movie. And then there's a boat ride. Some freaky lady. Getting bored. Still boating. Then I'm thinking the movie is picking up, but no. After a somewhat sad encounter with some bad guys, we basically see the already unstable mom just break down into crazy land. More weird encounters happen, but nothing is really to shocking or even interesting really. While they parents go farther into Thailand, on boat, to look for their child, I felt like I was watching ""Wake Up with Discovery Channel"" because there was just way to much scenery being thrown in with no story. I honestly think there was 5 minutes of no story, while we just watched a boat go down a river in cool angles and then shots of trees and mountains and other things. Really boring. By the time we got to the end, I could care less what happened with the parents or the child. But oh was I wrong. After the oh so shocking/stupid ending of the movie, I honestly wanted to burn the movie for how much I hated what happened.Even though I absolutely hated the character Emmanuelle played, I loved her acting. She was really good at being a mother who has just completely lost it. Rufus Sewell was pretty good to I guess, except for his dumb drunk scene.I do want to say one thing though. I kind of felt weird at the end of the movie. Me and my friend were saying ""Are they really doing that?"" Basically, right before the credits we see Emmanuelle B&eacute;art being rubbed down in mud by like 20+ kids that are around like 8-12 years old. Rubbed down right on the [...] and back. For around maybe 30-45 seconds. I started laughing because these kids, you could see were thinking `HECK YEAH [...]!!"" cause they were smiling all giddy like while constantly rubbing her [...]. That was a little weird.In the end, I would say, with all my heart, ignore this movie. I just don't see anything good about it. Yes it was kind of haunting and sad for the parents, but man the movie was just directed and edited badly I think.P.S. Finally one movie me and my Amazon bud Chris totally disagree on.",1,Beware of Children,1240185600,"04 20, 2009",2009,3925,"['Paul', 'Belhmer', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'Janet', 'Belhmer', 'Emmanuelle', 'B', 'eacute', 'art', 'are', 'parents', 'who', 'tragically', 'lost', 'son', 'tsunami', 'six', 'months', 'ago', 'Lost', 'lost', 'not', 'dead', 'was', 'evidence', 'son', 'was', 'dead', 'Then', 'one', 'day', 'charity', 'event', 'were', 'shown', 'video', 'poor', 'helpless', 'Thailand', 'video', 'Janet', 'lost', 'son', 'Paul', 'must', 'do', 'can', 'find', 'spot', 'find', 'son', 'couple', 'are', 'English', 'speaking', 'Americans', 'think', 'journey', 'unsafe', 'location', 'Thailand', 'anything', 'easy', 'Lies', 'trickery', 'heart-ache', 'await', 'search', 'son.Wow', 'could', 'not', 'believe', 'how', 'bored', 'was', 'movie', 'Was', ""n't"", 'even', 'fun', 'watch', 'friend', 'joke', 'kind', 'movie', 'either', 'OH', 'GOD', 'PLEASE', 'JUST', 'END', 'was', 'probably', 'shouted', 'about', '40', 'times', 'two', 'watching', 'started', 'beginning', 'credits', 'lot', 'words', 'were', 'turned', 'sideways', 'be', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'cool', 'Annoying', 'right', 'away', 'Then', 'credits', 'see', 'someone', 'J-Horror', 'type', 'black', 'hair', 'underwater', '2', 'minutes', 'very', 'loud', 'wave', 'crashing', 'static', 'type', 'noise', 'almost', 'wanted', 'throw', 'up', 'was', 'so', 'annoying', 'friend', 'started', 'screaming', 'WHY', 'WONT', 'IT', 'STOP', 'honestly', 'fast', 'forwarded', 'just', 'would', ""n't"", 'stop', 'Then', 'movie', 'FINALLY', 'beings', 'big', 'hipped', 'Emmanuelle', 'B', 'eacute', 'walking', 'water', 'here', 'go', 'now', 'time', 'spooky', 'stuff', 'begin', 'soon', 'Charity', 'event', 'happens', 'see', 'video', 'see', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'son', 'go', 'Got', 'ta', 'find', 'kid', 'Everything', 'going', 'smooth', 'then', 'get', 'aggravated', 'again', 'Daddy', 'pay', 'guy', '1.5', 'million', 'get', 'boat', 'ride', 'find', 'son', 'scream', 'Yen', 'seriously', 'got', '1.5', 'million', 'pay', 'guy', 'like', 'hours', 'Ok', 'just', 'let', 'movie', 'then', 'boat', 'ride', 'freaky', 'lady', 'Getting', 'bored', 'Still', 'boating', 'Then', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'movie', 'picking', 'up', 'somewhat', 'sad', 'encounter', 'bad', 'guys', 'basically', 'see', 'already', 'unstable', 'mom', 'just', 'break', 'down', 'crazy', 'land', 'More', 'weird', 'encounters', 'happen', 'nothing', 'really', 'shocking', 'even', 'interesting', 'really', 'parents', 'go', 'farther', 'Thailand', 'boat', 'look', 'child', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'Wake', 'Up', 'Discovery', 'Channel', 'was', 'just', 'way', 'much', 'scenery', 'being', 'thrown', 'story', 'honestly', 'think', 'was', '5', 'minutes', 'story', 'just', 'watched', 'boat', 'go', 'down', 'river', 'cool', 'angles', 'then', 'shots', 'trees', 'mountains', 'other', 'things', 'Really', 'boring', 'time', 'got', 'end', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'what', 'happened', 'parents', 'child', 'oh', 'was', 'wrong', 'oh', 'so', 'shocking/stupid', 'ending', 'movie', 'honestly', 'wanted', 'burn', 'movie', 'how', 'much', 'hated', 'what', 'happened.Even', 'absolutely', 'hated', 'character', 'Emmanuelle', 'played', 'loved', 'acting', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'being', 'mother', 'who', 'just', 'completely', 'lost', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'guess', 'dumb', 'drunk', 'scene.I', 'do', 'want', 'say', 'one', 'thing', 'kind', 'felt', 'weird', 'end', 'movie', 'Me', 'friend', 'were', 'saying', 'Are', 'really', 'doing', 'Basically', 'right', 'credits', 'see', 'Emmanuelle', 'B', 'eacute', 'being', 'rubbed', 'down', 'mud', '20+', 'kids', 'are', '8-12', 'years', 'old', 'Rubbed', 'down', 'right', '[', ']', 'back', 'maybe', '30-45', 'seconds', 'started', 'laughing', 'kids', 'could', 'see', 'were', 'thinking', 'HECK', 'YEAH', '[', ']', 'cause', 'were', 'smiling', 'giddy', 'constantly', 'rubbing', '[', ']', 'was', 'little', 'weird.In', 'end', 'would', 'say', 'heart', 'ignore', 'movie', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'anything', 'good', 'Yes', 'was', 'kind', 'haunting', 'sad', 'parents', 'man', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'directed', 'edited', 'badly', 'think.P.S', 'Finally', 'one', 'movie', 'Amazon', 'bud', 'Chris', 'totally', 'disagree']",Vinyan

1231225,A27JAIYP0U9FGH,B001QMCJ28,PJR,"[2, 3]","Five stars for the reviews alone! The film is a terrific ink blot and the 24 previous reviews are great and say so much about the horror film fans community. Thanks. Right guys, this is not a horror film and that community is right to feel ripped off by the false advertising.On the other hand what do we call it. Drama? No, the acting is impressive by that standard but the dramatic tension in ""will they find their kid"" is very thin. Adventure? No, the setting combined with the photography are grippingly exotic, but ""adventure"" does not hit the mark. Artsy? -- not exactly. Psychodrama? Maybe sorta.Several viewers refer to Heart of Darkness and Apocalypse Now. Yes of course -- there is a slide into madness in a quite foreign ""jungle"" setting and these iconic stories come to mind. There is a further parallel with the film in that the American adventure in Vietnam had the feeling of a mad obsession and of slim chances of success, and the wife in Vinyan certainly had a mad obsession about finding her son and slim chances of success. It is mad and compulsive obsession that is horror in both films. Viewers complain that the actions of the couple do not make sense. Of course they do not, anymore than the actions in Apocalypse Now do because they are crazed. The husband in Vinyan is crazed by guilt and apparently a codependency with his wife and feels to some extent responsible for her madness and so gets sucked into it, leading to his own destruction. So there is the horror of being trapped in guilt and co-dependency, but this is certainly not the blood and sadism and surprising shocks (or not so surprising shocks that one likes to groan at) that horror fans have a perfect right to expect for their bucks. It would be like paying to bungee jump and instead being lowered in a basket.Yes, this is not an action film! It is a SLOW slide into more and more craziness. The slowness underscores the relentlessness of obsession, but does not make for exciting action.The ending has been given away over and over in the previous 24 reviews. But I think the richness of the nude mud scene has been missed. I did think when I watched it, this could not have been made for an American audience because many will be conditioned to focus on boys rubbing the body and breasts of a mature woman as pedophilia. Of course several in the comments to the reviews did just this. Sorry but this is crazy if you think about it. There is nothing to suggest that the adult/wife is sexually seducing the boys.There is certainly ambiguity in this scene but the possibility that is most obvious is that the ""lost boys"" are giggling with her because they have found a mother, and she is delighted and giggling because she has found sons. The pleasure looks most like the primal joy of mother and child in suckling and nurturing. I say primal because of course they are all quite crazy and they are not literally suckling. We are shown mother/infant body contact among mad people.One can wonder if when the boys get older they might gang-bang her. But that is not part of the film itself.I think all this is pretty straight forward. One could get Freudian I suppose and wonder if the boys are doing some Oedipal thing in killing their symbolic father and lusting after their symbolic mother. But I don't think viewers have to worry about this. I think the film is not that deep. It stands very well on its own as a well-acted and photographed dreamy portrayal of self-destructive obsession.PS -- Film production lovers. The extra feature that shows the problems of shooting so many difficult shots in the jungle, as well as in the streets and brothels, will make you appreciate this film as a technical achievement all the more.",5,nightmare,1286928000,"10 13, 2010",2010,3720,"['Five', 'stars', 'reviews', 'alone', 'film', 'terrific', 'ink', 'blot', '24', 'previous', 'reviews', 'are', 'great', 'say', 'so', 'much', 'horror', 'film', 'fans', 'community', 'Thanks', 'Right', 'guys', 'not', 'horror', 'film', 'community', 'right', 'feel', 'ripped', 'off', 'false', 'advertising.On', 'other', 'hand', 'what', 'do', 'call', 'Drama', 'No', 'acting', 'impressive', 'standard', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'will', 'find', 'kid', 'very', 'thin', 'Adventure', 'No', 'setting', 'combined', 'photography', 'are', 'grippingly', 'exotic', 'adventure', 'not', 'hit', 'mark', 'Artsy', 'not', 'exactly', 'Psychodrama', 'Maybe', 'sorta.Several', 'viewers', 'refer', 'Heart', 'Darkness', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'Yes', 'course', 'slide', 'madness', 'quite', 'foreign', 'jungle', 'setting', 'iconic', 'stories', 'come', 'mind', 'further', 'parallel', 'film', 'American', 'adventure', 'Vietnam', 'had', 'feeling', 'mad', 'obsession', 'slim', 'chances', 'success', 'wife', 'Vinyan', 'certainly', 'had', 'mad', 'obsession', 'finding', 'son', 'slim', 'chances', 'success', 'mad', 'compulsive', 'obsession', 'horror', 'films', 'Viewers', 'complain', 'actions', 'couple', 'do', 'not', 'make', 'sense', 'course', 'do', 'not', 'anymore', 'actions', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'do', 'are', 'crazed', 'husband', 'Vinyan', 'crazed', 'guilt', 'apparently', 'codependency', 'wife', 'feels', 'extent', 'responsible', 'madness', 'so', 'sucked', 'leading', 'own', 'destruction', 'horror', 'being', 'trapped', 'guilt', 'co-dependency', 'certainly', 'not', 'blood', 'sadism', 'surprising', 'shocks', 'not', 'so', 'surprising', 'shocks', 'one', 'groan', 'horror', 'fans', 'have', 'perfect', 'right', 'expect', 'bucks', 'would', 'be', 'paying', 'bungee', 'jump', 'instead', 'being', 'lowered', 'basket.Yes', 'not', 'action', 'film', 'SLOW', 'slide', 'more', 'more', 'craziness', 'slowness', 'relentlessness', 'obsession', 'not', 'make', 'exciting', 'action.The', 'ending', 'been', 'given', 'away', 'previous', '24', 'reviews', 'think', 'richness', 'nude', 'mud', 'scene', 'been', 'missed', 'did', 'think', 'when', 'watched', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'American', 'audience', 'many', 'will', 'be', 'conditioned', 'focus', 'boys', 'rubbing', 'body', 'breasts', 'mature', 'woman', 'pedophilia', 'course', 'several', 'comments', 'reviews', 'did', 'just', 'Sorry', 'crazy', 'think', 'nothing', 'suggest', 'adult/wife', 'sexually', 'seducing', 'boys.There', 'certainly', 'ambiguity', 'scene', 'possibility', 'most', 'obvious', 'lost', 'boys', 'are', 'giggling', 'have', 'found', 'mother', 'delighted', 'giggling', 'found', 'sons', 'pleasure', 'most', 'primal', 'joy', 'mother', 'child', 'suckling', 'nurturing', 'say', 'primal', 'course', 'are', 'quite', 'crazy', 'are', 'not', 'literally', 'suckling', 'are', 'shown', 'mother/infant', 'body', 'contact', 'mad', 'people.One', 'can', 'wonder', 'when', 'boys', 'get', 'older', 'might', 'gang-bang', 'not', 'part', 'film', 'itself.I', 'think', 'pretty', 'straight', 'forward', 'One', 'could', 'get', 'Freudian', 'suppose', 'wonder', 'boys', 'are', 'doing', 'Oedipal', 'thing', 'killing', 'symbolic', 'father', 'lusting', 'symbolic', 'mother', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'viewers', 'have', 'worry', 'think', 'film', 'not', 'deep', 'very', 'well', 'own', 'well-acted', 'photographed', 'dreamy', 'portrayal', 'self-destructive', 'obsession.PS', 'Film', 'production', 'lovers', 'extra', 'feature', 'problems', 'shooting', 'so', 'many', 'difficult', 'shots', 'jungle', 'as', 'well', 'streets', 'brothels', 'will', 'make', 'appreciate', 'film', 'technical', 'achievement', 'more']",Vinyan

1231227,AKI1CK229BDUC,B001QMCJ28,PsyRC,"[0, 1]","I completely get what the director was trying to do, and it was a mock-valiant effort on his part; the dark settings, the dream-like shots, and the faux-delusional performance by the main actress. The philosophical undertones are there, they just need to be dug out from beneath the hard-to-buy acting and set-ups.  We are all interchangeable, at a physical and psychic level; in her state of utmost despair, Jeanne was hurdled into a psychotic state of mind, and very interestingly incorporating the semblance of delusional misidentification syndrome (namely, Fregoli syndrome); any and all of those children were Joshua. I do believe that this film could have gotten its point across, because the premise is actually appealing; unfortunately that was not enough to leave me with more than an empty sensation after it ended. The dude playing Paul was not believable, and his reactions to the bizarre situations arising were deadened by his own disbelief as an actor. Jeanne just figured that adopting the dead fish expression throughout the film would be sufficient, apart from a possible ripoff from the Piano Teacher with regards to the sex scene in which any and all human emotion has long abandoned her carcass. Now, the only crude emotion she displayed was during the final scene, and I believe this was not a scripted reaction; her smiling showed simply her obvious arousal with the situation, in a very primitive and sexualized manner, irrespective of any taboos people may have about the particular content. Again, it was the symbolic transfiguring into the literal, as the psychogenic bre*st was incorporated into the lives of children who had no healthy attachment to a caregiver, so we can look at the scene as a form of regression on their part, reacquiring the bre*st in an attempt to somehow be reborn through her... and she experienced the giving of life in this straining-to-be-poignant moment, and was thus reborn as well.",2,Avant-garde gone awry,1262390400,"01 2, 2010",2010,1940,"['completely', 'get', 'what', 'director', 'was', 'trying', 'do', 'was', 'mock-valiant', 'effort', 'part', 'dark', 'settings', 'dream-like', 'shots', 'faux-delusional', 'performance', 'main', 'actress', 'philosophical', 'undertones', 'are', 'there', 'just', 'need', 'be', 'dug', 'out', 'hard-to-buy', 'acting', 'set-ups', 'are', 'interchangeable', 'physical', 'psychic', 'level', 'state', 'utmost', 'despair', 'Jeanne', 'was', 'hurdled', 'psychotic', 'state', 'mind', 'very', 'interestingly', 'incorporating', 'semblance', 'delusional', 'misidentification', 'syndrome', 'namely', 'Fregoli', 'syndrome', 'children', 'were', 'Joshua', 'do', 'believe', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'gotten', 'point', 'premise', 'actually', 'appealing', 'unfortunately', 'was', 'not', 'enough', 'leave', 'more', 'empty', 'sensation', 'ended', 'dude', 'playing', 'Paul', 'was', 'not', 'believable', 'reactions', 'bizarre', 'situations', 'arising', 'were', 'deadened', 'own', 'disbelief', 'actor', 'Jeanne', 'just', 'figured', 'adopting', 'dead', 'fish', 'expression', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'sufficient', 'apart', 'possible', 'ripoff', 'Piano', 'Teacher', 'regards', 'sex', 'scene', 'human', 'emotion', 'long', 'abandoned', 'carcass', 'Now', 'only', 'crude', 'emotion', 'displayed', 'was', 'final', 'scene', 'believe', 'was', 'not', 'scripted', 'reaction', 'smiling', 'showed', 'simply', 'obvious', 'arousal', 'situation', 'very', 'primitive', 'sexualized', 'manner', 'irrespective', 'taboos', 'people', 'may', 'have', 'particular', 'content', 'Again', 'was', 'symbolic', 'transfiguring', 'literal', 'psychogenic', 'bre*st', 'was', 'incorporated', 'lives', 'children', 'who', 'had', 'healthy', 'attachment', 'caregiver', 'can', 'look', 'scene', 'form', 'regression', 'part', 'reacquiring', 'bre*st', 'attempt', 'somehow', 'be', 'reborn', 'experienced', 'giving', 'life', 'straining-to-be-poignant', 'moment', 'was', 'thus', 'reborn', 'as', 'well']",Vinyan
1231228,A91FE91BI7XIW,B001QMCJ28,S. Fischer,"[0, 1]","A white couple lose their young son in a tsunami in Thailand. 6 months later, the husband has accepted his child's death, but the mother can't handle the loss at all and keeps seeing her son in other children. When they watch a video of Burmese children, the mother is convinced that the blurry kid they see only from behind is their missing son. He must have been washed ashore in Burma! After all, he's wearing a red shirt just like their son did! The husband doesn't really believe it, but he doesn't want to disappoint the wife he loves deeply, and he still feels guilt because he couldn't hold on to the son during the tsunami, so he agrees to go  to Burma with her. Since the country doesn't permit travellers, they pay a very large sum of money to criminals to take them there and find the child. This leads to a life-threatening horror trip into the Burmese jungle.So far, so good. The plot is psychologically interesting, the actors are truly fine (especially Rufus Sewell as the husband), and up to a certain point, the story is convincing. But after a while, the director loses himself in weird scenes that don't make any sense, there are no explanations for the strange events in the second half of the film, and he basically steals from other movies when he moves into this section (think Apocalypse Now and the like). What could have been an interesting psychological drama turns into meaningless nonsense with a few shock / horror elements. The title (Vinyan means 'angry spirits', which are supposed to remain on earth after a violent death in many Asian beliefs) may explain the otherwise inexplicable hundreds of brutal children with painted faces that start showing up more and more as the film continues (maybe, I'm really not sure). But on the whole I see this film as a wasted opportunity to tell a good story with fine actors in an interesting landscape.

Can't really categorize it as a horror movie but might be able to call it a supernatural thriller. Very unusual theme and very European in execution and story. Not your usual run of the mill supernatural thriller.There are a few scenes that are absolutely nerve wracking and there are a couple of characters in the movie that will make you very ill at ease-which is the goal.The acting is quite good and the two main stars have a few scenes that really produce emotional result. And Emmanuelle Beart? Stunningly beautiful as always. Worth a look just to watch her.I can't tell you anything about the movie without giving something away so I will just say that it takes a European slant on things, this means a lot of symbolism and a lot of wondering about what is going on.I was surprised to see Julie Dreyfus in this movie. She is the uneartly beautiful woman who Plays Sofie Fatale in Tarantino'sKill Bill - Volume TwoAnd she is perfectly cast in this movie -beautiful yet with something very bad brewing underneath -its a bit unnerving how well she plays this duality.

It's original.An American couple in Thailand discover possible evidence that their young son who died in a tsunami six months earlier is still alive and living in the jungles of Myanmar (Burma). They pay some dubious characters a lot of money to go up river into the forbidden country. Things go from bad to worse.""Vinyan"" is equal parts haunting, beautiful, strange and creepy. The plot is thin but the story maintains your attention. The acting is excellent all around and you believe that these characters are real. The five main characters are Paul and Jeane Bellmer (Rufus Sewell and Emmanuelle B&eacute;art), a human trafficker named Thaksin Gao, the captain of the small boat named Soncha and the couple's liaison, Kim (Julie Dreyfus).Memorable parts abound -- Kim's subtle-but-clear seduction of Paul, the beautiful floating-lanterns at the beach ceremony, the awesome tree fortress, etc.The meaning of the film is ambiguous, but it provokes thought on many things: The nature of grief -- letting go or not letting go, obsession, madness, tribal instincts, going feral and more.As for the tribe of lost kids in the last act, are they vinyan -- angry, confused spirits who suffered horrible deaths -- or are they simply a pack of kids gone wild in the jungle a la ""Lord of the Flies""? I say the evidence points to the latter.In any event, ""Vinyan"" has elements of films like ""apocalypse now,"" ""The Emerald Forest,"" ""Fitzcarraldo"" (or ""Aguirre, the Wrath of God"") and ""Lord of the Flies"".The film runs 96 minutes and was shot in Thailand.GRADE: B+",4,Haunting descent into jungle hell,1364774400,"04 1, 2013",2013,1675,"['Many', 'reviewers', 'denounce', '2008', 'Vinyan', 'not', 'typical', 'horror', 'film', 'precisely', 'why', 'worthwhile', 'original.An', 'American', 'couple', 'Thailand', 'discover', 'possible', 'evidence', 'young', 'son', 'who', 'died', 'tsunami', 'six', 'months', 'earlier', 'still', 'alive', 'living', 'jungles', 'Myanmar', 'Burma', 'pay', 'dubious', 'characters', 'lot', 'money', 'go', 'up', 'river', 'forbidden', 'country', 'Things', 'go', 'bad', 'worse', 'Vinyan', 'equal', 'parts', 'haunting', 'beautiful', 'strange', 'creepy', 'plot', 'thin', 'story', 'attention', 'acting', 'excellent', 'believe', 'characters', 'are', 'real', 'five', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'Paul', 'Jeane', 'Bellmer', 'Rufus', 'Sewell', 'Emmanuelle', 'B', 'eacute', 'art', 'human', 'trafficker', 'named', 'Thaksin', 'Gao', 'captain', 'small', 'boat', 'named', 'Soncha', 'couple', 'liaison', 'Kim', 'Julie', 'Dreyfus', '.Memorable', 'parts', 'abound', 'Kim', 'subtle-but-clear', 'seduction', 'Paul', 'beautiful', 'floating-lanterns', 'beach', 'ceremony', 'awesome', 'tree', 'fortress', 'etc.The', 'meaning', 'film', 'ambiguous', 'thought', 'many', 'things', 'nature', 'grief', 'letting', 'go', 'not', 'letting', 'go', 'obsession', 'madness', 'tribal', 'instincts', 'going', 'feral', 'more.As', 'tribe', 'lost', 'kids', 'last', 'act', 'are', 'vinyan', 'angry', 'confused', 'spirits', 'who', 'suffered', 'horrible', 'deaths', 'are', 'simply', 'pack', 'kids', 'gone', 'wild', 'jungle', 'la', 'Lord', 'Flies', 'say', 'evidence', 'points', 'latter.In', 'event', 'Vinyan', 'elements', 'films', 'apocalypse', 'now', 'Emerald', 'Forest', 'Fitzcarraldo', 'Aguirre', 'Wrath', 'God', 'Lord', 'Flies', '.The', 'film', '96', 'minutes', 'was', 'shot', 'Thailand.GRADE', 'B+']",Vinyan
