1413161,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B004LLIRTU,David Baldwin,"[1, 1]","I was drawn to this movie because I recalled my two older sisters seeing it at the time of it's theatrical release and saying how great it was.  I might have been twelve then and I was more inclined to see ""Jaws"" for a fourth time than waste my time on a girly flick.  Regardless, this recalled to me a film from 1956 called ""Interrupted Melody"" that starred the incomparable Eleanor Parker as a rising opera singer who was felled by polio at the heighth of her fame.  The distinction between these two films is that Parker's character's illness did not silence her voice but the result of Jill Kinmont's(Marilyn Hassett) skiing accident means she cannot renew a semblance of the life she once knew.  Prior to her accident the world was Kinmont's oyster.  She was at the top of her game and headed to the 1956 Winter Olympics.  Like many athletes her drive and determination belied some narcissism and arrogance.  When the reality of permanent paralysis hits her Jill has new obstacles to overcome.  Not only does she have to tackle her physical shortcomings but she has to rebuild herself as a person.  Jill's journey is both grueling and touching.  Hassett, an actress who inexplicably fell off the map after starring in an adaptation of Sylvia Plath's ""The Bell Jar"" in 1979, does monumental work assaying the transitions that Kinmont has to go through to realize her true worth as a person.  The physical demands of the role as well as the emotional ones are handled seamlessly by Hassett.  There's a side story involving a relationship with a daredevil skier played by Beau Bridges that could scuttle the movie but that's not the case.  Instead of being a time capsule curio ""The Other Side of the Mountain"" is relevant today because it's themes are universal.",5,Old Fashioned Tear Jerker,1327190400,"01 22, 2012",2012,1765,"['was', 'drawn', 'movie', 'recalled', 'two', 'older', 'sisters', 'seeing', 'time', 'theatrical', 'release', 'saying', 'how', 'great', 'was', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'twelve', 'then', 'was', 'more', 'inclined', 'see', 'Jaws', 'fourth', 'time', 'waste', 'time', 'girly', 'flick', 'Regardless', 'recalled', 'film', '1956', 'called', 'Interrupted', 'Melody', 'starred', 'incomparable', 'Eleanor', 'Parker', 'rising', 'opera', 'singer', 'who', 'was', 'felled', 'polio', 'heighth', 'fame', 'distinction', 'two', 'films', 'Parker', 'character', 'illness', 'did', 'not', 'silence', 'voice', 'result', 'Jill', 'Kinmont', 'Marilyn', 'Hassett', 'skiing', 'accident', 'can', 'not', 'renew', 'semblance', 'life', 'once', 'knew', 'Prior', 'accident', 'world', 'was', 'Kinmont', 'oyster', 'was', 'top', 'game', 'headed', '1956', 'Winter', 'Olympics', 'many', 'athletes', 'drive', 'determination', 'belied', 'narcissism', 'arrogance', 'When', 'reality', 'permanent', 'paralysis', 'Jill', 'new', 'obstacles', 'overcome', 'Not', 'only', 'have', 'tackle', 'physical', 'shortcomings', 'rebuild', 'person', 'Jill', 'journey', 'grueling', 'touching', 'Hassett', 'actress', 'who', 'inexplicably', 'fell', 'off', 'map', 'starring', 'adaptation', 'Sylvia', 'Plath', 'Bell', 'Jar', '1979', 'monumental', 'work', 'assaying', 'transitions', 'Kinmont', 'go', 'realize', 'true', 'worth', 'person', 'physical', 'demands', 'role', 'as', 'well', 'emotional', 'ones', 'are', 'handled', 'seamlessly', 'Hassett', 'side', 'story', 'involving', 'relationship', 'daredevil', 'skier', 'played', 'Beau', 'Bridges', 'could', 'scuttle', 'movie', 'not', 'case', 'Instead', 'being', 'time', 'capsule', 'curio', 'Other', 'Side', 'Mountain', 'relevant', 'today', 'themes', 'are', 'universal']",N/A

1413163,A3D2DJEHR4U7HC,B004LLIRTU,"D. Hinson ""D. Hinson""","[1, 1]","I remember seeing this as a kid, and how much it resonated with me at the time.  It is a tragic story, to be sure, and this movie is definitely one of those tearjerkers that plays on your emotions to get the point across.  The music swells in just the right places--at all the perfect pivotal moments--thus pushing all the right emotional buttons to great effect.  It's all very obvious, and undoubtedly designed to wrench every tear from your heart as the story unfolds.  That's why it was the blockbuster hit that it was back in the day.  Still...it is very effectively done, and beautifully acted by everyone in the cast--Marilyn Hassett in particular.  Yes, it could have been more subtly rendered, but, still, it really does the job well if you can abide such sappiness.  I sat through it again tonight, with a more astute eye for its interpretation of the story, and still felt that proverbial lump in my throat over and over, once again, even with the benefit of hindsight and clarity that age sometimes brings to one's esthetic.I would still recommend this to anyone with a soft heart, and the capacity for imagining what could have been, under different circumstances. The Olivia Newton-John song, ""Richard's Window""--a reference to the late Dick Buek--at the end of the movie--is the proverbial nail in the coffin.  Watch it and weep.  Is the emotion one feels for this tragic character who rises from the ashes any less meaningful in spite of all of the intended shmaltz?  In my estimation, no.  Sometimes this kind of movie is just a balm for the soul.  It was like visiting an old friend seeing it again last night.  I had some reservations about purchasing the On Demand dvr offered here, but aside from two hiccups in the movie toward the end, it played beautifully on my 31"" television--in letterbox, as it should be seen.",4,"Still a powerful story about the resilience of the human spirit, despite its flaws....",1330646400,"03 2, 2012",2012,1838,"['remember', 'seeing', 'kid', 'how', 'much', 'resonated', 'time', 'tragic', 'story', 'be', 'sure', 'movie', 'definitely', 'one', 'tearjerkers', 'emotions', 'get', 'point', 'music', 'just', 'right', 'places', 'perfect', 'pivotal', 'moments', 'thus', 'pushing', 'right', 'emotional', 'buttons', 'great', 'effect', 'very', 'obvious', 'undoubtedly', 'designed', 'wrench', 'tear', 'heart', 'story', 'unfolds', 'why', 'was', 'blockbuster', 'hit', 'was', 'back', 'day', 'Still', 'very', 'effectively', 'done', 'beautifully', 'acted', 'everyone', 'cast', 'Marilyn', 'Hassett', 'particular', 'Yes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'subtly', 'rendered', 'still', 'really', 'job', 'well', 'can', 'abide', 'such', 'sappiness', 'sat', 'again', 'tonight', 'more', 'astute', 'eye', 'interpretation', 'story', 'still', 'felt', 'proverbial', 'lump', 'throat', 'once', 'again', 'even', 'benefit', 'hindsight', 'clarity', 'age', 'sometimes', 'one', 'esthetic.I', 'would', 'still', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'soft', 'heart', 'capacity', 'imagining', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'different', 'circumstances', 'Olivia', 'Newton-John', 'song', 'Richard', 'Window', 'reference', 'late', 'Dick', 'Buek', 'end', 'movie', 'proverbial', 'nail', 'coffin', 'Watch', 'weep', 'emotion', 'one', 'feels', 'tragic', 'character', 'who', 'ashes', 'less', 'meaningful', 'spite', 'intended', 'shmaltz', 'estimation', 'Sometimes', 'kind', 'movie', 'just', 'balm', 'soul', 'was', 'visiting', 'old', 'friend', 'seeing', 'again', 'last', 'night', 'had', 'reservations', 'purchasing', 'Demand', 'dvr', 'offered', 'here', 'aside', 'two', 'hiccups', 'movie', 'end', 'played', 'beautifully', '31', 'television', 'letterbox', 'should', 'be', 'seen']",N/A

Marilyn Hassett and Beau Bridges both put in what seem like heartfelt performances.  Bridges is both romantic and sad in his portrayal of Dick Buek, champion ski racer and daredevil boyfriend of Jill Kinmont (Hassett).  You get the impression there is more to his story, and we never find out what that is.  This left me wanting to know more.  Hassett though seems over the top at times in her emotional expressions.  This may be one reason why she never really went that far as an actress in her own right.  She may have been just about perfect for this role, but she obviously was rather limited in her general acting talent.
