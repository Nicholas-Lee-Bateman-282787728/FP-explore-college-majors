980626,AN7NK92JUYU98,B000EXZKQM,Mr Peabody,"[0, 0]","If you have a Blu-ray player and enjoy Jazz this is a must have.  Each performance is great.  The styles of Jazz vary from performer to performer.  I like a variety of music so this was not a problem for me. It shouldn't for most either, since, after all, the performers are ""Jazz Legends"". The most benefit from this disc will be to those who have their Blu-ray hooked up to an audio system and especially if you can take advantage of the Dolby Tru-HD sound track here.  There is also a two channel uncompressed sound track.  I haven't been one to embrace multi-channel music but this disc is an excellent example of how surround sound music can be done right and with Tru-HD listening becomes quite an experience.  The mix is done as if you are in the audience.  The instruments are in front of you with just enough to surround speakers to give ambience to the music.  The video, of course, being in high definition, is stunning as well.  Legends of Jazz on Blu-ray is a real audio video treat and the price is no more than a typical CD.
