Griffiths ""Adrian""","[0, 0]","I sat down to watch this expecting to mock it for being wooden and mawkish, but instead of laughing at it, I found it to be better than I expected, so I'm inclined to review it fairly positively.You can't escape the fact, though, that it really is simply a vehicle for Liberace, and at 115 minutes long, it outstays its welcome. The extra bloat is all down to prolonged sequences of Liberace playing the piano, which naturally are there to showcase his talent but they really grind the pace of the film to a halt. The story is uncomplicated: Liberace plays a pianist who suddenly loses his hearing which changes his life in more ways than expected.Although Liberace does not have much range as an actor, he does impart some sense of emotion as his life changes. Not a lot, but some. And with him are some more seasoned actors who all acquit themselves fairly well. It's a shame that the story did focus on the plot more than the piano playing, although to see it for the story one could always watch ""The Man Who Played God"", an earlier film that this is a remake of.So basically if you like Liberace as a performer, you could enjoy this. Even I, while getting bored during most of the lengthy concert sequences, did enjoy his ""Boogie-Woogie"" set piece, and I could see how his fans found him to be an entertaining performer. But for anyone watching for the story, it's too melodramatic and preachy in too many places to really draw you in.Probably more of a curiosity piece than anything else, but as I said at the start of the review, it is not a total failure, and actually does stand up as moderately entertaining piece of schmaltz. I was able to buy the UK Region 2 DVD which is a lot less expensive than the Amazon.com far eastern import, although the UK Orbit Media DVD is not great quality, it's in full screen and with faded colours and a blurry image. However it is cheap!Comment",2,Passable,1365552000,"04 10, 2013",2013,1889,"['sat', 'down', 'watch', 'expecting', 'mock', 'being', 'wooden', 'mawkish', 'instead', 'laughing', 'found', 'be', 'better', 'expected', ""'m"", 'inclined', 'review', 'fairly', 'positively.You', 'ca', ""n't"", 'escape', 'fact', 'though', 'really', 'simply', 'vehicle', 'Liberace', '115', 'minutes', 'long', 'welcome', 'extra', 'bloat', 'down', 'prolonged', 'sequences', 'Liberace', 'playing', 'piano', 'naturally', 'are', 'there', 'showcase', 'talent', 'really', 'grind', 'pace', 'film', 'halt', 'story', 'uncomplicated', 'Liberace', 'pianist', 'who', 'suddenly', 'hearing', 'life', 'more', 'ways', 'expected.Although', 'Liberace', 'not', 'have', 'much', 'range', 'actor', 'impart', 'sense', 'emotion', 'life', 'changes', 'Not', 'lot', 'are', 'more', 'seasoned', 'actors', 'who', 'acquit', 'fairly', 'well', 'shame', 'story', 'did', 'focus', 'plot', 'more', 'piano', 'playing', 'see', 'story', 'one', 'could', 'always', 'watch', 'Man', 'Who', 'Played', 'God', 'earlier', 'film', 'remake', 'of.So', 'basically', 'like', 'Liberace', 'performer', 'could', 'enjoy', 'Even', 'getting', 'bored', 'most', 'lengthy', 'concert', 'sequences', 'did', 'enjoy', 'Boogie-Woogie', 'set', 'piece', 'could', 'see', 'how', 'fans', 'found', 'be', 'entertaining', 'performer', 'anyone', 'watching', 'story', 'too', 'melodramatic', 'preachy', 'too', 'many', 'places', 'really', 'draw', 'in.Probably', 'more', 'curiosity', 'piece', 'anything', 'else', 'said', 'start', 'review', 'not', 'total', 'failure', 'actually', 'stand', 'up', 'moderately', 'entertaining', 'piece', 'schmaltz', 'was', 'able', 'buy', 'UK', 'Region', '2', 'DVD', 'lot', 'less', 'expensive', 'Amazon.com', 'far', 'eastern', 'import', 'UK', 'Orbit', 'Media', 'DVD', 'not', 'great', 'quality', 'full', 'screen', 'faded', 'colours', 'blurry', 'image', 'However', 'cheap', 'Comment']","Sincerely yours (1955) / All Region DVD / Audio: English / Subtitle: Chinese / Starring: Joanne Dru, Liberace Director: Gordon Douglas"

Liberace is a very good actor after all. this movie is also overflowing with Liberace's music and his personal brand of homey sentimentality. this is a delight for any fan who can't wait for a major release of this.for what it is, the presentation is not bad. and it will do more than suffice for the long waiting and impatient. buy it.",5,All Region DVD From BoYing On Amazon Is A Excellent Buy At $18.99.

I never thought he was as good as Oscar Levant; but, he knew how to wow an audience - even in his old 30-minute TV shows.

It looks grainy but as the seller said, it is the only version on DVD. Dorothy Malone co-stars in it and Liberace shows his piano talent like nobody else could do. His Museum in Las Vegas finally closed down. I was glad to be one of the last visitors to see it.NOTE: Since this review, Warner Bros. has released it. But, I sent it back for exchange because it was a bad transfer and freeze framed at the end. I hope Warner Bros. does it right. Liberace wasn't appreciated by people in the fifties, when he had his TV show. They could tell he was gay, and overlooked his talent. But, today things have changed and you can enjoy the Warner Bros. version, if they get it corrected. Too bad his museum in Las Vegas has closed.
