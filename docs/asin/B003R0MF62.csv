1359966,A2B7SS9OH87HLR,B003R0MF62,Boston Reader,"[2, 5]","Some will say that this probably ""just another grr-reat year of SVU."" That will be their opinion as this is mine we're all allowed to disagree. With that being said, this season is actually part of the three worst seasons of SVU in my opinion. It would probably easier to list the episodes I did like. The one with Jennifer Love Hewitt (mainly b/c of the crossover with LA), the Campus rape episode, Christine Lahti's last epiosde, the one where Casey Novak returns and DDA Dekker makes a guest appaerance, the last one with Jeremy Irons, the with the masked freak and the one written by Chris Brancato about an abduction and blackmail. The one episode that I striaght out hate most is ""Bombshell."" And I remember that one by heart because it was the worst hour of TV i have ever wasted. There were a lot of stupid characters in this episode and as for the plot, well you didn't have to be a psychic to see how awful it was going to end once your were halfway through the episode. It is as if the show had lost its quality. Nearly every episode ended with cliche ""plot-twist"" of a death, but it didn't make you feel anything. Not even sympathy. The only deaths that were really meaningful were ADA Paxton (if you think she improved from season 11) and the victim's daughter in the last episode. There's very little element of actual police procedure, there's very little emotion. In fact the only the only emotion happens to be Stabler's anger, but even that looked like it was overdone and like most of the cast it was getting old. But my biggest complaint was the lacking of Sergeant John Munch, who by the way has supervisor duties over all the detectives, which was for the most part ignored throughout seasons 9-12. Where was the veteran Baltimore Homicide Detective who left dead bodies in Baltimore to be with living traumatized victims in New York?For the quality of the product, I have nothing to say. But the quality of the episodes is pretty much drained. SVU use to be unique and standout from most of the crap on TV, but this season and the two before it are now just the same as anything else. I will gladly recommend good episodes and good ""SVU"" episodes from these three seasons, but I will certainly not recommend seasons 10-12. If you just like to watch SVU to see Stabler, Benson or both, then by all means buy this season even though there is no character development. Buy this season if you are just a collector or a loyal fan of SVU or all things Law & Order. But if you're looking for a good quality show, with great plots with victims that will make you sympathize and suspects that'll make your skin crawl then get the older seasons or season 13.But by all means this is a must for Elliot Stabler fans, for this is sadly his last season on the show. I wish Mr. Meloni all the best in his career, he is a tremendous actor and I hope he will find great roles to fill. Thank you Mr. Meloni for 12 years you've given us.",1,Note: This Review is for the quality of the season and not the product.,1349568000,"10 7, 2012",2012,2941,"['will', 'say', 'probably', 'just', 'grr-reat', 'year', 'SVU', 'will', 'be', 'opinion', 'mine', ""'re"", 'allowed', 'disagree', 'being', 'said', 'season', 'actually', 'part', 'three', 'worst', 'seasons', 'SVU', 'opinion', 'would', 'probably', 'easier', 'list', 'episodes', 'did', 'like', 'one', 'Jennifer', 'Love', 'Hewitt', 'mainly', 'b/c', 'crossover', 'LA', 'Campus', 'rape', 'episode', 'Christine', 'Lahti', 'last', 'epiosde', 'one', 'where', 'Casey', 'Novak', 'returns', 'DDA', 'Dekker', 'guest', 'appaerance', 'last', 'one', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'masked', 'freak', 'one', 'written', 'Chris', 'Brancato', 'abduction', 'blackmail', 'one', 'episode', 'striaght', 'out', 'hate', 'most', 'Bombshell', 'remember', 'one', 'heart', 'was', 'worst', 'hour', 'TV', 'i', 'have', 'ever', 'wasted', 'were', 'lot', 'stupid', 'characters', 'episode', 'plot', 'well', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'psychic', 'see', 'how', 'awful', 'was', 'going', 'end', 'once', 'were', 'halfway', 'episode', 'show', 'had', 'lost', 'quality', 'Nearly', 'episode', 'ended', 'cliche', 'plot-twist', 'death', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'feel', 'anything', 'Not', 'even', 'sympathy', 'only', 'deaths', 'were', 'really', 'meaningful', 'were', 'ADA', 'Paxton', 'think', 'improved', 'season', '11', 'victim', 'daughter', 'last', 'episode', 'very', 'little', 'element', 'actual', 'police', 'procedure', 'very', 'little', 'emotion', 'fact', 'only', 'only', 'emotion', 'be', 'Stabler', 'anger', 'even', 'looked', 'was', 'overdone', 'most', 'cast', 'was', 'getting', 'old', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'was', 'lacking', 'Sergeant', 'John', 'Munch', 'who', 'way', 'supervisor', 'duties', 'detectives', 'was', 'most', 'part', 'ignored', 'seasons', '9-12', 'Where', 'was', 'veteran', 'Baltimore', 'Homicide', 'Detective', 'who', 'left', 'dead', 'bodies', 'Baltimore', 'be', 'living', 'traumatized', 'victims', 'New', 'York', 'quality', 'product', 'have', 'nothing', 'say', 'quality', 'episodes', 'pretty', 'much', 'drained', 'SVU', 'use', 'be', 'unique', 'standout', 'most', 'crap', 'TV', 'season', 'two', 'are', 'now', 'just', 'same', 'anything', 'else', 'will', 'gladly', 'recommend', 'good', 'episodes', 'good', 'SVU', 'three', 'seasons', 'will', 'certainly', 'not', 'recommend', 'seasons', '10-12', 'just', 'watch', 'SVU', 'see', 'Stabler', 'Benson', 'then', 'means', 'buy', 'season', 'even', 'character', 'development', 'Buy', 'season', 'are', 'just', 'collector', 'loyal', 'fan', 'SVU', 'things', 'Law', 'Order', ""'re"", 'looking', 'good', 'quality', 'show', 'great', 'plots', 'victims', 'will', 'make', 'sympathize', ""'ll"", 'make', 'skin', 'crawl', 'then', 'get', 'older', 'seasons', 'season', '13.But', 'means', 'must', 'Elliot', 'Stabler', 'fans', 'sadly', 'last', 'season', 'show', 'wish', 'Mr.', 'Meloni', 'best', 'career', 'tremendous', 'actor', 'hope', 'will', 'find', 'great', 'roles', 'fill', 'Thank', 'Mr.', 'Meloni', '12', 'years', ""'ve"", 'given']",Law & Order: Special Victims Unit - The Twelfth Year
1359967,AW3VZ5O895LRK,B003R0MF62,"carol irvin ""carol irvin""","[4, 12]","I wasn't that surprised that Chris Melloni-Elliott-dropped out at the end of this season.  Nor that Mariska Hagarty-Olivia- would be in at most half of the episodes next season.  There is just about nothing left to do in this series except continue to make money doing it and I assume these two now have other offers.  I've enjoyed the whole Law & Order franchise, all three versions of it.  However, it has been doing the same formula for too long on all of its shows.  What was unusual about this show was that it was (basically) sex crimes. However, there are only so many variations on even that deviant world and this show has just about covered every one of them.Season 12 presented the usual assortment of cases, all with a deviant sexual orientation. If not squarely sexual, the crime was sexually suggestive. Virtually all of these shows led to a murder too. Although sex crimes do occur without murders, this series has almost always ended up with a murder too in the second half of the show.I am having trouble remembering individual episodes as all 12 seasons are kind of blurring together in my head now.They are all more alike than they are different.  One thing I would have liked was more involvement by the others in the cast, such as Wong the psychiatrist, plus Ice T and Richard Belkin, two other detectives in the unit.  I couldn't keep track of all of the attorneys who kept rotating in and out of this show. I would have liked Christine Lahti to take over that role but her character was written out.  So overall it was a bit too much the Olivia and Elliott show yet I can't see this show surviving without them.The other thing which must be factored in is that we know are able to see international crime shows and compare them to these American shows.  I just finished watching the Danish KILLING, the Swedish IRENE HUSS, the UK Luther, etc., This is really stiff competition in the crime drama department as we Americans are fascinated to watch crime in another country.  I just started watching another crime show set in Scotland.Perhaps Dick Wolf should take his bows all around and ride off into the sunset with the blue flashers going like mad on his stretch limo.",4,Good But Running Out of Gas,1309305600,"06 29, 2011",2011,2193,"['was', ""n't"", 'surprised', 'Chris', 'Melloni-Elliott-dropped', 'out', 'end', 'season', 'Mariska', 'Hagarty-Olivia-', 'would', 'be', 'most', 'half', 'episodes', 'season', 'just', 'nothing', 'left', 'do', 'series', 'continue', 'make', 'money', 'doing', 'assume', 'two', 'now', 'have', 'other', 'offers', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'whole', 'Law', 'Order', 'franchise', 'three', 'versions', 'However', 'been', 'doing', 'same', 'formula', 'too', 'long', 'shows', 'What', 'was', 'unusual', 'show', 'was', 'was', 'basically', 'sex', 'crimes', 'However', 'are', 'only', 'so', 'many', 'variations', 'even', 'deviant', 'world', 'show', 'just', 'about', 'covered', 'one', 'them.Season', '12', 'presented', 'usual', 'assortment', 'cases', 'deviant', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'not', 'squarely', 'sexual', 'crime', 'was', 'sexually', 'suggestive', 'Virtually', 'shows', 'led', 'murder', 'too', 'sex', 'crimes', 'do', 'occur', 'murders', 'series', 'almost', 'always', 'ended', 'up', 'murder', 'too', 'second', 'half', 'show.I', 'am', 'having', 'trouble', 'remembering', 'individual', 'episodes', '12', 'seasons', 'are', 'kind', 'blurring', 'together', 'head', 'now.They', 'are', 'more', 'alike', 'are', 'different', 'One', 'thing', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'was', 'more', 'involvement', 'others', 'cast', 'such', 'Wong', 'psychiatrist', 'Ice', 'T', 'Richard', 'Belkin', 'two', 'other', 'detectives', 'unit', 'could', ""n't"", 'keep', 'track', 'attorneys', 'who', 'kept', 'rotating', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'Christine', 'Lahti', 'take', 'over', 'role', 'character', 'was', 'written', 'out', 'So', 'overall', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'Olivia', 'Elliott', 'show', 'yet', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'show', 'surviving', 'them.The', 'other', 'thing', 'must', 'be', 'factored', 'know', 'are', 'able', 'see', 'international', 'crime', 'shows', 'compare', 'American', 'shows', 'just', 'finished', 'watching', 'Danish', 'KILLING', 'Swedish', 'IRENE', 'HUSS', 'UK', 'Luther', 'etc.', 'really', 'stiff', 'competition', 'crime', 'drama', 'department', 'Americans', 'are', 'fascinated', 'watch', 'crime', 'country', 'just', 'started', 'watching', 'crime', 'show', 'set', 'Scotland.Perhaps', 'Dick', 'Wolf', 'should', 'take', 'bows', 'around', 'ride', 'off', 'sunset', 'blue', 'going', 'mad', 'stretch', 'limo']",Law & Order: Special Victims Unit - The Twelfth Year

That's what happens when a show has been around for as long as SVU has.  And that's not a bad thing.  It isn't that all the episodes are the same.  The lack of originality in my reviews more stem from not wanting to give the plots away for all the episodes rather than a lack of detail in the show itself.Law and Order SVU is about the Special Victims Unit.  For those of you somehow stumbling into this review without having heard of this show before, this means the police force that deals with the special crimes of rape, and abuse of elders and children.  Anything with a sexual overtone is also included.  Because of these hard topics, it's probably not considered a show for kids.  And some of the episodes contain very hard topics.  ""Behave"" is especially frightening, with a woman being stalked and re-raped by her abuser every few years to the extent that she is no longer able to cope or leave the house.  It was probably the best episode of the season.  There were a few I didn't like though.  ""Pop"" which was a fight club type of episode that didn't have sympathetic characters.  ""Bombshell"" which involved alternative lifestyles and then went even wackier with incest.  I'm not saying these things don't happen in real life, but the way they were portrayed in this season was almost cheesy.Characters:Christopher Meloni as Det. Elliot StablerMariska Hargitay as Det. Olivia BensonRichard Belzer as Sgt. John MunchIce-T as Det. Fin TutuolaB. D. Wong as Dr. George HuangTamara Tunie as Dr. Melinda WarnerDann Florek as Capt. Don CragenThe cast doesn't change too much in this series (although I hear that changes next season).  You've got Meloni and Hargitay as the hard hitters.  They have great on-screen chemistry and really work well together.  You'd almost wish they were real detectives out there getting the bad guys.  Belzer again isn't in this season as much.  He's almost a guest character with as little as he appears in this show in the last few years.  Ice-T had a little bit of a bigger role, but always as a support to Hargitay or Meloni.  And I didn't see too much of Cragen in this one, which was a disappointment.  Some of the bad guys were cheesy this go around and some were actually sympathetic.  You wanted to hate some of them but just couldn't because of their pitiable past.The camera work is just as gruesome as any other season.  There's blood, murder, associations with rape and other things.  Plus a visit to a sex club (although no sex is actually shown) among other things are in this season.  It's not entirely graphic but it's enough that viewers who are sensitive to these things should take caution.  More of the film work focuses on the detectives talking to people and interviewing suspects though.  And that's the better part of the show as it involves character interaction.I've got mixed feelings heading into the next season but this one wasn't too bad and is a load better than a ton of other shows out there right now.  At least this one tries to raise awareness and seek justice.Review by M.

Eliot Stabler was a Jarhead and a HOT Head but you always knew his heart was in the right place.  He stood for the victim no matter what their age, race or gender.  Eliot was a passionate character who was haunted at times even tormented by his flaws.  Eliots flaws are what made him the most human and this was his last and best ever season.Yes Eliot rides into the sunset at the end of this 12th season after these many years fighting the good fight angainst multitudonous Special Victoms Unit evil doers.  The nice thing is Eliot does not die, he just gets that well deserved good rest all truely awesome policemen should have after years protecting good people from the hellraisers in even his fictional New York community.  The rest of the acting is top notch as you have come to expect in, Law & Order: Special Victims Unit - The Twelfth Year!  If anything I would say the 12 year stories are some of the best tightly written well acted SUV dramas ever.  Law & Order: Special Victims Unit - The Twelfth Year exzudes all the qualities that made Law & Order SVU a must see show.  I must admit this 12th Season is one of my most favorite Law & Order runs ever.  Every person involved seemed to step up their game in Season 12 Eliot's final season and it shows in the consistant high quality of work here.Eliot goes out in typical Stabler style but I won't reveal how here.  Buy Law & Order: Special Victims Unit - The Twelfth Year and find out for yourself.  I don't think you will be disappointed I wasn't!
