I being an Alice in Wonderland fanatic bought it hoping it would be something I would love to watch again and again. Maybe it's because I'm not 4? I just didn't like it that much and I don't think I will ever watch it again.

1261531,A2UBSGFCP2QFNV,B002BYSG0Y,"Greg Ehrbar ""'MouseTracksOnline'""","[15, 20]","This year we've seen Abby Cadaby of ""Sesame Street"" go to the Muppet version of Wonderland, next year we're going to a Tim Burton vision of Wonderland, but right now we can follow Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and the gang down a different sort of rabbit hole.""Mickey Mouse Clubhouse"" is a CG-animated daytime series for preschoolers on the Playhouse Disney schedule of the Disney Channel. It has some references to the original ""Mickey Mouse Club"" -- a roll call, for example -- but instead of Mouseketeers, Mickey and his pals play a more central role. The stories are simple and involve viewer participation, in the style of ""Dora the Explorer.""This lengthened episode takes the gang to a gentler version of the Lewis Carroll land, where the characters suggest Mother Goose more than Wonderland and the songs are short ditties. It's nice to see characters like Daisy Duck, Clarabelle Cow and others join the action with Mickey, Goofy and Minnie. Most of all, it gives young children a chance to get to know these characters as something besides merchandise.The late, great Wayne Allwine is on hand here to voice Mickey, along with his widow, Russi Taylor as Minnie. Recently announced Disney Legends Tony Anselmo and Bill Farmer voice Donald and Goofy, respectively. The program can be played in two modes for different age groups with questions for advanced play. A bonus episode of ""Mickey Mouse Clubhouse"" called ""Goofy Goes Goofy"" rounds out the package.",4,Mickey goes to a CG Wonderland tailored for youngsters,1253491200,"09 21, 2009",2009,1457,"['year', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Abby', 'Cadaby', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'go', 'Muppet', 'version', 'Wonderland', 'next', 'year', ""'re"", 'going', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'vision', 'Wonderland', 'right', 'now', 'can', 'follow', 'Mickey', 'Mouse', 'Donald', 'Duck', 'gang', 'down', 'different', 'sort', 'rabbit', 'hole', 'Mickey', 'Mouse', 'Clubhouse', 'CG-animated', 'daytime', 'series', 'preschoolers', 'Playhouse', 'Disney', 'schedule', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'references', 'original', 'Mickey', 'Mouse', 'Club', 'roll', 'call', 'example', 'instead', 'Mouseketeers', 'Mickey', 'pals', 'play', 'more', 'central', 'role', 'stories', 'are', 'simple', 'involve', 'viewer', 'participation', 'style', 'Dora', 'Explorer', 'lengthened', 'episode', 'gang', 'gentler', 'version', 'Lewis', 'Carroll', 'land', 'where', 'characters', 'suggest', 'Mother', 'Goose', 'more', 'Wonderland', 'songs', 'are', 'short', 'ditties', 'nice', 'see', 'characters', 'Daisy', 'Duck', 'Clarabelle', 'Cow', 'others', 'join', 'action', 'Mickey', 'Goofy', 'Minnie', 'Most', 'young', 'children', 'chance', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'something', 'merchandise.The', 'late', 'great', 'Wayne', 'Allwine', 'hand', 'here', 'voice', 'Mickey', 'widow', 'Russi', 'Taylor', 'Minnie', 'Recently', 'announced', 'Disney', 'Legends', 'Tony', 'Anselmo', 'Bill', 'Farmer', 'voice', 'Donald', 'Goofy', 'respectively', 'program', 'can', 'be', 'played', 'two', 'modes', 'different', 'age', 'groups', 'questions', 'advanced', 'play', 'bonus', 'episode', 'Mickey', 'Mouse', 'Clubhouse', 'called', 'Goofy', 'Goes', 'Goofy', 'out', 'package']",Disney Mickey Mouse Clubhouse: Mickey's Adventures In Wonderland
