643908,A34VV92TSLC37R,B00005JOYL,Adam Craig,"[0, 2]","Nighwatch is the first part in a dark fantasy trilogy out of Russia.  The basic backstory to the film is that the forces of Dark and Light have had a Truce ever since an ancient battle where both sides realized neither could defeat the other.  The Truce involves both sides keeping the other ""in check.""  The forces of Light, called the Nightwatch, are supposed to make sure no Dark Others break the Truce.  The same is true for the forces of Dark, who are called the Daywatch.  The film opens with a flashback of our main character, Anton, who is a seer, and he is employing a woman to get his woman back for him and give her a miscarriage.  The forces of Light stop the woman from completing the miscarriage, and this is when Anton first finds out that he is an Other, and can see the forces of Light and Dark as they truly are.  Flash forward twelve years, and Anton is now a full-fledged member of the Nightwatch, which is run by Gesser, who has been the leader of the forces of Light for all of time.  The real story of the film starts when Anton is given an assignment to stop a twelve-year old boy from succumbing to ""the Call,"" which is what vampires use to lure their victims into a trap and suck their blood.  On his assignment, Anton comes across a woman with a ""vortex"" around her.  He is later told that this woman is ""the virgin,"" and her return signals that the final battle between Light and Dark is about to take place, with the balance changing forever.  Another part of this prophecy involves the coming of an Other who is more powerful than any other ever before.  This Other must choose between Light and Dark, as all must, and the side he chooses will decide which side will win the last battle.Okay, now that that has all been said, I hope everyone is still with me as to what is going on.  The film is very convoluted and tough to follow.  There is a whole lot that goes totally unexplained throughout the whole movie, and I guess that is to be expected if you view the film as the first chapter in the trilogy that is yet to be finished.  We are introduced to a bunch of characters, but we only get to know two or three of them, with the others just being background and essential for certain scenes to take place.On the up side, the visuals in the film are absolutely amazing.  This is some of the coolest imagery that I have seen in a movie in a long time, but visuals aren't everything, and this film proves that.  The story is very interesting too, and the film does a fairly good job of developing the historical context of what is going on, but there is a lot that is mentioned that we get no information on whatsoever, and that sort of leaves the viewer out of the loop.  Maybe you need to read the book to get the true essence of the film, and I probably will, but as a stand alone movie, this film just basically does not work on a lot of levels.  As the first chapter in a trilogy, I can see how it will fit in with the other two films, but I don't even know if those are going to be released in the U.S., so it is tough to judge this film based on the trilogy, and not on the film itself.  I also think the film would have been a lot better if it would have simply included more action.  There is a surprising lack of action in the film.  There are really only 3 action scenes in a 2-hour film, and none of them are that long or impressive.  Again, this film is only set up, as most first volumes of a trilogy are, but still, I was expecting a little more along the lines of entertainment than I got.Overall, Nightwatch is one of those films that I wouldn't say I liked or disliked, it just sort of.....is what it is.  When the film is released on DVD, I will definitely give it another chance, and I am sure that I will see the other parts of the trilogy if they ever do get released in the U.S.  There really isn't anything groundbreaking here, though.",3,(3.5) Don't really know what to say...,1141603200,"03 6, 2006",2006,3890,"['Nighwatch', 'first', 'part', 'dark', 'fantasy', 'trilogy', 'Russia', 'basic', 'backstory', 'film', 'forces', 'Dark', 'Light', 'have', 'had', 'Truce', 'ever', 'ancient', 'battle', 'where', 'sides', 'realized', 'neither', 'could', 'defeat', 'other', 'Truce', 'sides', 'keeping', 'other', 'check', 'forces', 'Light', 'called', 'Nightwatch', 'are', 'supposed', 'make', 'sure', 'Dark', 'Others', 'break', 'Truce', 'same', 'true', 'forces', 'Dark', 'who', 'are', 'called', 'Daywatch', 'film', 'flashback', 'main', 'character', 'Anton', 'who', 'seer', 'employing', 'woman', 'get', 'woman', 'back', 'give', 'miscarriage', 'forces', 'Light', 'stop', 'woman', 'completing', 'miscarriage', 'when', 'Anton', 'first', 'out', 'Other', 'can', 'see', 'forces', 'Light', 'Dark', 'truly', 'are', 'Flash', 'forward', 'twelve', 'years', 'Anton', 'now', 'full-fledged', 'member', 'Nightwatch', 'run', 'Gesser', 'who', 'been', 'leader', 'forces', 'Light', 'time', 'real', 'story', 'film', 'when', 'Anton', 'given', 'assignment', 'stop', 'twelve-year', 'old', 'boy', 'succumbing', 'Call', 'what', 'use', 'lure', 'victims', 'trap', 'suck', 'blood', 'assignment', 'Anton', 'woman', 'vortex', 'later', 'told', 'woman', 'virgin', 'return', 'signals', 'final', 'battle', 'Light', 'Dark', 'take', 'place', 'balance', 'changing', 'forever', 'part', 'prophecy', 'coming', 'Other', 'who', 'more', 'powerful', 'other', 'ever', 'before', 'Other', 'must', 'choose', 'Light', 'Dark', 'must', 'side', 'will', 'decide', 'side', 'will', 'win', 'last', 'battle.Okay', 'now', 'been', 'said', 'hope', 'everyone', 'still', 'what', 'going', 'film', 'very', 'convoluted', 'tough', 'follow', 'whole', 'lot', 'totally', 'unexplained', 'whole', 'movie', 'guess', 'be', 'expected', 'view', 'film', 'first', 'chapter', 'trilogy', 'yet', 'be', 'finished', 'are', 'introduced', 'bunch', 'characters', 'only', 'get', 'know', 'two', 'three', 'others', 'just', 'being', 'background', 'essential', 'certain', 'scenes', 'take', 'place.On', 'up', 'side', 'visuals', 'film', 'are', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'coolest', 'imagery', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'long', 'time', 'visuals', 'are', ""n't"", 'everything', 'film', 'story', 'very', 'interesting', 'too', 'film', 'fairly', 'good', 'job', 'developing', 'historical', 'context', 'what', 'going', 'lot', 'mentioned', 'get', 'information', 'whatsoever', 'sort', 'viewer', 'loop', 'Maybe', 'need', 'read', 'book', 'get', 'true', 'essence', 'film', 'probably', 'will', 'stand', 'alone', 'movie', 'film', 'just', 'basically', 'not', 'work', 'lot', 'levels', 'first', 'chapter', 'trilogy', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'will', 'fit', 'other', 'two', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'released', 'U.S.', 'tough', 'judge', 'film', 'based', 'trilogy', 'not', 'film', 'also', 'think', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'better', 'would', 'have', 'simply', 'included', 'more', 'action', 'surprising', 'lack', 'action', 'film', 'are', 'really', 'only', '3', 'action', 'scenes', '2-hour', 'film', 'none', 'are', 'long', 'impressive', 'Again', 'film', 'only', 'set', 'up', 'most', 'first', 'volumes', 'trilogy', 'are', 'still', 'was', 'expecting', 'little', 'more', 'lines', 'entertainment', 'got.Overall', 'Nightwatch', 'one', 'films', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'liked', 'disliked', 'just', 'sort', '..is', 'what', 'When', 'film', 'released', 'DVD', 'will', 'definitely', 'give', 'chance', 'am', 'sure', 'will', 'see', 'other', 'parts', 'trilogy', 'ever', 'do', 'get', 'released', 'U.S', 'really', ""n't"", 'anything', 'groundbreaking', 'here', 'though']",Nochnoy dozor

The author inspired himself in several sources, including possibly white wolf's world of Darkness (he even incorporated the ""umbra"") and created something unique. It was a true challenge to the director Timur Bekmambetov because not only he didn't had experience in those kind of films, his country also never had done nothing like it, neither the professional technicians nor the actors had worked in a fantasy movie before! This film is pioneering work done with inspiration and geniality. The angles are fabulous, the pacing is marvelous, the photography is first rate - it's scary, disturbing and quite violent - yes, it has quite some disturbing scenes (viewer discretion is advised).The fight between Light and Dark is not exactly between good and evil (although very close), but also between responsibility and free will. The characters are extremely well portrayed and we can empathize with both Geser and Zavulon, the faction leaders (they are both extremely charismatic). Anton (the main character), brilliantly depicted by Konstantin Khabensky, is a nightwatch seer that gets involved in a nightmarish complex plot where the fate of the balance of powers is at stake.As extras you will get several featurettes about the characters, subtitles and the series; there is also the trailer (although Russia has great cinema, I believe they must work a lot on this great marketing tool - the trailer), posters, making of, etc. Three stars for the extras.

No plot spoilers from me; the movie follows Anton, an agent of the ""Night Watch"", who keeps an eye on Dark Forces and protects a 1000 year old truce. There is a ""vortex"" forming in Moscow that heralds the restarting of the war between Light and Dark and Anton is assigned to find the cause. Along the way, we see that there is another reality that sort of runs concurrently with ours and it is filled with people who have special abilities (vampires, witches, fortune tellers, etc)  and who have chosen a side, either Light or Dark. The plot is solid and there are a few really good twists that makes this so much better than the standard horror flick.The acting is very good, but the dialog is in Russian with subtitles in English. I understand that the theatrical release had much better subtitles that were actually like a part of the movie, but the ones on this version were perfectly serviceable.

643927,A1DBQOB2CVLDOS,B00005JOYL,"Chris Van Deelen ""Chris Van Deelen""","[0, 1]","Foreign films are not easy to review. The biggest problem is usually in the translation.Have you ever tired to watch a poorly dubbed or translated Chinese martial arts film? They tend to be hilarious due to the translation from Chinese to English. Usually this happens when it's translated in Hong Kong or China.Another problem with reviewing a foreign film is that quite often cultural references and other minor nuances are lost on the viewer.Consider this. Over the years I've watched quite a few Filipino and Hindi Movies. For me, most of the Filipino movies I've watched were pretty straightforward and easy to understand, although quite often there were obvious differences between our culture and theirs.Hindi movies on the other hand - well, most of the time when I watched one I was left sitting there scratching my head in confusion. Humour, unless it was slapstick or obvious, was completely lost on me.The other night I watched a movie called Nightwatch. It's based on the first book of a modern day Russian fantasy / horror trilogy that was a major hit over in the former Soviet Union country.It was so successful in fact that they made movies of the first two books in the trilogy.Now, being a fan of this type of genre (not a huge fan, but a fan none the less), I decided to give the two movies that have been made a shot. I bought both of them and they've been sitting on my shelf for several weeks, waiting for the opportune moment for me to sit down and give them a view.After I finished watching the movie, I was left scratching my head. I was able to follow, for the most part, what was going on in it, but I'm pretty sure that I missed a great deal due to the cultural differences between Canada and Russia.The story, from what I could gather, is that for centuries the balance between good and evil has been carefully maintained. There are essentially two organizations, the Nightwatch (good) and the Daywatch (evil). They are, in effect, the police force for good and evil, and they monitor one another constantly.The world is filled with what they call `others'. These others (not the Lost type, mind you), are Vampires, magic wielders, shape shifters, and other creatures of mythology.Legend has it that there will be an other born who will tip the scales for either good or evil, but this other will have to choose which side he or she will join. It's supposed to lead to Armageddon.The movie begins with a young man going to a witch to get back the woman he loves, and to kill the unborn child she's carrying in her womb. The ceremony is interrupted by the Nightwatch, and much to everyone's surprise, he can see them.Fast forward twelve years and he's now part of the Nightwatch.Now, this is where the movie gets confusing. Is he a vampire? I honestly don't know. But he's sent out to track down a child who is one of the others in order to prevent him from falling into the hands of vampires.Things go south real fast, and he kills one of the Vampires. From the way I understand it, there is no killing between the two factions. If there is, it's treated like a crime and those responsible are punished.Anyhow, it just keeps getting stranger and stranger, and the plot revolves for some reason around this child, and a cursed woman who has to have the curse removed or the world will be destroyed.Honestly, I couldn't figure out what was going on, and I was still pretty confused when the movie ended, but I'm pretty sure that they were able to resolve things and they prevented the destruction of the world.At least for the time being.Now, the acting was, I guess, ok. Hey, they were all Russian actors and thus completely unknown to me. The movie itself was set in Moscow, and man, I thought we had some ugly cities, but the movie was shot mainly in run-down neighbourhoods, so I'll have to assume that it was done on purpose.The special effects were pretty good, nothing absolutely spectacular. Plenty of use of computer graphics anyhow. Although the whole bit with the crows and the vortex over the apartment complex was pretty neat.I have to say that I didn't really care for the movie now that I've had some time to digest it and think about it. The main reason is that it was so difficult to understand.Normally I pick up on fantasy and science fiction easily, but in this case, it was over my head.And, as the beginning of my review stated, I'm pretty sure it had to do with the cultural barrier that I faced sitting down to watch it.Will I watch the sequel, Daywatch? Yeah, I am going to. I know it's a longer movie, but the fact is that I paid for it, and I don't like to throw money away.Finally, the lack of bonus material was disconcerting. There was an extended roof top scene (near the end of the movie) and that was it.2.5 out of 5",3,Confusing to watch - lost in translation maybe?,1199232000,"01 2, 2008",2008,4776,"['Foreign', 'films', 'are', 'not', 'easy', 'review', 'biggest', 'problem', 'usually', 'translation.Have', 'ever', 'tired', 'watch', 'poorly', 'dubbed', 'translated', 'Chinese', 'martial', 'arts', 'film', 'tend', 'be', 'hilarious', 'due', 'translation', 'Chinese', 'English', 'Usually', 'when', 'translated', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'China.Another', 'problem', 'reviewing', 'foreign', 'film', 'quite', 'often', 'cultural', 'references', 'other', 'minor', 'nuances', 'are', 'lost', 'viewer.Consider', 'years', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'quite', 'few', 'Filipino', 'Hindi', 'Movies', 'most', 'Filipino', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'were', 'pretty', 'straightforward', 'easy', 'understand', 'quite', 'often', 'were', 'obvious', 'differences', 'culture', 'theirs.Hindi', 'movies', 'other', 'hand', 'well', 'most', 'time', 'when', 'watched', 'one', 'was', 'left', 'sitting', 'there', 'scratching', 'head', 'confusion', 'Humour', 'was', 'slapstick', 'obvious', 'was', 'completely', 'lost', 'me.The', 'other', 'night', 'watched', 'movie', 'called', 'Nightwatch', 'based', 'first', 'book', 'modern', 'day', 'Russian', 'fantasy', '/', 'horror', 'trilogy', 'was', 'major', 'hit', 'former', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'country.It', 'was', 'so', 'successful', 'fact', 'made', 'movies', 'first', 'two', 'books', 'trilogy.Now', 'being', 'fan', 'type', 'genre', 'not', 'huge', 'fan', 'fan', 'none', 'less', 'decided', 'give', 'two', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'shot', 'bought', ""'ve"", 'been', 'sitting', 'shelf', 'several', 'weeks', 'waiting', 'opportune', 'moment', 'sit', 'down', 'give', 'view.After', 'finished', 'watching', 'movie', 'was', 'left', 'scratching', 'head', 'was', 'able', 'follow', 'most', 'part', 'what', 'was', 'going', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'missed', 'great', 'deal', 'due', 'cultural', 'differences', 'Canada', 'Russia.The', 'story', 'what', 'could', 'gather', 'centuries', 'balance', 'good', 'evil', 'been', 'carefully', 'maintained', 'are', 'essentially', 'two', 'organizations', 'Nightwatch', 'good', 'Daywatch', 'evil', 'are', 'effect', 'police', 'force', 'good', 'evil', 'monitor', 'one', 'constantly.The', 'world', 'filled', 'what', 'call', 'others', 'others', 'not', 'Lost', 'type', 'are', 'Vampires', 'magic', 'wielders', 'shape', 'shifters', 'other', 'creatures', 'mythology.Legend', 'will', 'be', 'other', 'born', 'who', 'will', 'tip', 'scales', 'good', 'evil', 'other', 'will', 'have', 'choose', 'side', 'will', 'join', 'supposed', 'lead', 'Armageddon.The', 'movie', 'young', 'man', 'going', 'witch', 'get', 'back', 'woman', 'kill', 'unborn', 'child', 'carrying', 'womb', 'ceremony', 'interrupted', 'Nightwatch', 'much', 'everyone', 'surprise', 'can', 'see', 'them.Fast', 'forward', 'twelve', 'years', 'now', 'part', 'Nightwatch.Now', 'where', 'movie', 'confusing', 'vampire', 'honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'sent', 'out', 'track', 'down', 'child', 'who', 'one', 'others', 'order', 'prevent', 'falling', 'hands', 'vampires.Things', 'go', 'south', 'real', 'fast', 'one', 'Vampires', 'way', 'understand', 'killing', 'two', 'factions', 'treated', 'crime', 'responsible', 'are', 'punished.Anyhow', 'just', 'getting', 'stranger', 'stranger', 'plot', 'reason', 'child', 'cursed', 'woman', 'who', 'have', 'curse', 'removed', 'world', 'will', 'be', 'destroyed.Honestly', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'was', 'still', 'pretty', 'confused', 'when', 'movie', 'ended', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'were', 'able', 'resolve', 'things', 'prevented', 'destruction', 'world.At', 'least', 'time', 'being.Now', 'acting', 'was', 'guess', 'ok.', 'Hey', 'were', 'Russian', 'actors', 'thus', 'completely', 'unknown', 'movie', 'was', 'set', 'Moscow', 'man', 'thought', 'had', 'ugly', 'cities', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'mainly', 'run-down', 'neighbourhoods', ""'ll"", 'have', 'assume', 'was', 'done', 'purpose.The', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'pretty', 'good', 'nothing', 'absolutely', 'spectacular', 'Plenty', 'use', 'computer', 'graphics', 'anyhow', 'whole', 'bit', 'crows', 'vortex', 'apartment', 'complex', 'was', 'pretty', 'neat.I', 'have', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'movie', 'now', ""'ve"", 'had', 'time', 'digest', 'think', 'main', 'reason', 'was', 'so', 'difficult', 'understand.Normally', 'pick', 'up', 'fantasy', 'science', 'fiction', 'easily', 'case', 'was', 'head.And', 'beginning', 'review', 'stated', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'had', 'do', 'cultural', 'barrier', 'faced', 'sitting', 'down', 'watch', 'it.Will', 'watch', 'sequel', 'Daywatch', 'Yeah', 'am', 'going', 'know', 'longer', 'movie', 'fact', 'paid', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'throw', 'money', 'away.Finally', 'lack', 'bonus', 'material', 'was', 'disconcerting', 'was', 'extended', 'roof', 'top', 'scene', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'it.2.5', '5']",Nochnoy dozor

Night Watch uses a Lord of the Rings type battle scene in flashback to explain the back story of Night Watch.The action then moves to Moscow (circa 1992).  Then the story becomes a cross between Underworld, and Men in Black.Night Watch is the first Russian fantasy movie after communism.  The director says, ""Night Watch is the reflection of American culture, (meaning movies) through Russian eyes.""When American colleagues complemented the director on the design  of the world for the movie Night Watch, he said, ""this is really reality.  I couldn't make this stuff up.  This is really just Russia through Russian eyes, (minus the vampires of course.)  This in reality, is just the Russian take on storytelling.Overall, I would say that Night Watch is a good movie, about the struggle between good and evil.  You can categorize it as urban fantasy, which is why I compare it to Underworld.The movie takes place between two parallel worlds.  The world of Faerie (which the movie calls The Gloom), and our world.The movie is interesting, because we get to see cultural differences in storytelling between Russia and the United States.So if you like fantasy movies, horror movies with vampires, or movies about alternate reality.  I'd like to suggest that you give Night Watch (Nochnoi Dozor) a try.The director, sometimes struggles to get his point across in the commentaries, but he eventually does so.  I believe this is mostly due to the difficulty speaking US English for someone who has not been born here.The writer's subtitled commentary is also interesting, and it adds to the DVD.

It's actually a little difficult to review Night Watch (Nochnoy Dozor); it's a film you hate to criticize, even though the plot can get pretty confusing at times.  The special effects are darned impressive, certainly up to (if not better than) the standards of your typical Hollywood blockbuster, but I don't think the stylish atmosphere of the film rises to the point of richness.  Night Watch actually reminded me a bit of Constantine in that regard - but I must say that Night Watch is easily the better film of the two.What you've got here is basically an eternal struggle between good and evil, with both sides really residing in a gray area in between.  Supposedly, there was this huge confrontation between the forces long ago - but, seeing that both equally matched sides would surely annihilate one another, both sides agreed to a truce that has held for many, many years.  Light rules the day, Night rules the night, and both sides watch one another to make sure no one goes around messing with that whole balance thing.  Who are these guys, anyway?  They call themselves the Others, and everyone among them has some kind of special power that is decidedly more than human (most humans can't transform themselves into cheetahs, for example).  As with all such mystical beings, there's a prophecy.  This one says that some Other will emerge and win the day for one side - it could be Light, or it could be Dark.  Sounds a little like Star Wars, doesn't it?Anton Gorodetsky (Konstantin Khabensky) discovers that he is an Other after seeking the assistance of some ooby jooby lady to get his wife back.  That whole thing doesn't go too well, which isn't all bad because a wife would sort of get in the way of Anton's new job - tracking down vampires who are illegally ""calling"" victims to them.  Even though he chose the Light side, he still has to scarf down a bunch of blood in order to exercise his special gift.  Things start to heat up after he kinda sorta kills one of the agents of Darkness, but everything comes down to a contest between both sides to lay claim to a boy who may bring balance to the Force (oops, I mean tip the balance for one side over the other).  There's a twist toward the end, which probably won't come as a huge surprise to some viewers, but the conclusion succeeds very well in setting the stage for the next installment in what will be a trilogy of films.While I can't get as breathlessly excited over the film as a good many others have (including the population of Russia, who made this the country's highest grossing film ever - although it only held that title for a few months), it's still an enjoyable, visually stunning, decidedly different type of film - and a real treat for Western audiences.  Don't worry about the subtitles, either, as they are superb.

Anton Gorodetsky is a reluctant, semi-alcoholic agent of  ""The Nightwatch"" - a self-regulating body pledged to keeping the forces of darkness, ""The Daywatch"", in check and prosecuting those of the day-watch who threaten the truce which has kept an uneasy peace between theses diametrically opposed forces for thousands of years.However cataclysmic forces are gathering on the streets of Moscow - forces which have haunted Anton's past, threaten to destroy the present peace, and ignite a firestorm that could well destroy all our futures.'Nightwatch' is an urban fantasy for for people who don't like or who have grown bored of urban fantasy as a genre. Whilst taking stylistic cues from the likes ofBlade (New Line Platinum Series)and the truly awfulThe Matrix, it is a completely original and visionary work which breathes new life into a stale and overwrought genre. Although it contains vampires, witches, curses and other ephemera of the genre, it treats them in a refreshingly grungy and highly intelligent manner. Whilst the pacing, cinematography, special effects and editing are geared towards the hyper-kinetic, director Timur Bekmambetov never allows the film's style to overwhelm the essential ordinariness or humanity of it's characters - a factor which is of critical importance in the film's denouement.Highly recommended.

I liked the movie, even though it has a few holes in the plot.This is a kind of rare film that portraits an ethernal battle between the forces that govern light and darkness. The battle begun many centturies ago over a bridge where both armies clashed. Seing that the balances of their forces were even and that only the total annihilation of both sides will end the battle, both sides signed a truce. Now in modern day Moscow member of both sides live among humans, and are known as ""The Others"". The ones supported by the forces of light govern during daylight, while the night belongs to the Dark side of the force (no reference to Star Wars). The dark ""Others"" live as vampires during the night, and there is a ""Night Watch"" patrol run by the light ""others"", and a ""Day Watch"" run by the dark ""Others"". Each side watch each other in order to asure that the conditions set by the truce stays in place.There is a legend about an specially powerful ""other"" that will be born and forced to take one of the sides, breaking the balance between Light and Dark.There is something nicely rare about this movie that makes you like it. Maybe is because there so many interesting characters, you will encounter Vampires, Shape-shifters, Witches, Warriors that pull they swords from their spine.

When I saw this in the rental store, I got it right away. I didn't know what to expect from a Russian 'action' film, especially one dealing with western-style supernatural themes. I was pleasantly surprised.If you want gore and non-stop action, this is not your film. It is moody and mildly depressing (in a Russian way, not a Woody Allen way) but a great deal of fun. I got into it right away, and loved most of it. I didn't see the point of not allowing the airplane to land, until I thought of where the airport might be. An airport right in the middle of a populated area wouldn't be able to let an airplane land when there was no visibility and the possibility of a tornado to boot. They should have just left the airplane out, or put someone of importance (another Light Other? a key Dark Other?) on board. It could be deleted with no harm. And at the end, the guy should have just said ""Wait. You aren't telling the whole truth. You tricked me"" or something to that effect. But all in all, I will watch this film more than once.Many of the reviewers who did not like the film sounded like they're in their early 20s, especially when reading their other reviews. This film might not appeal to that generation because it is slow, there is little blood and gore (thank God. Nothing more boring than a slasher film), lots of plot, lots of mood. This isn't what our studios are cranking out, and the difference will take getting used to, if all you know is U.S. blockbuster trash.Rent the video and see it in both English and Russian with subtitles. Be aware: the Russian starts out in English. It does change languages at last. The dubbed version (speaking English) is kind of cheesy but still okay. If you aren't sure about watching foreign-language films, watch the English. It isn't terrible.I do wish there was more on why dark is evil and light is good. Both drink blood and both feed on humans.

However, compared to other Russian movies, it is 4.5 to 5 stars. It's the biggest thing I've seen come out of Russia in a long time.Over and over, I see people comparing this movie to The Matrix. Frankly, I just don't think that is a very good comparison. There are a few topical similarities, but plot-wise and subject-matter-wise, it just really didn't remind me of The Matrix at all.This movie is about introducing you to some of the finer points of an underworld that involves supernatural creatures such as werewolves, vampires, shapeshifters, etc. And I mean that literally, it is about INTRODUCING you to this world. The storyline doesn't really cover a lot of ground beyond setting up the situations and characters for the upcoming conflict, the battle to end all battles.Indeed, having now watched the trailer for the second movie, Day Watch, I find it rather amusing that the TRAILER for movie #2 has more explanation of the storyline in it than the entire first movie.

There is a great deal of reference to special powers, but most of them are not seen in the movie at all.

643940,A3T4SJNHKDQ09C,B00005JOYL,dyzml,"[8, 26]","I'm honestly speechless. I've never seen a movie so over-hyped in my life - there are no action sequences (unless u consider quick-cutting to random screams & close-up shots of open eyeballs 'action'), the special effects are lame (when they even show up - watch the trailer and u'll see all there is to see of the tiger woman - a whole 2 seconds!), and the acting wooden. I'm a big fan of B movies, but it really pisses me off when a film as bad as this gets so much attention and truly great movies like 'the descent' go relatively unnoticed. The film isn't even cheesy in a good way - there are no cool monster designs, no witty one-liners, really no action or gore, and, worst of all, it is actually trying to be serious with its hokey plot. You get a certain amateur charm with most B movies, but for some reason the ones that always seem to be pressing for attention end up just looking ridiculous. And is it just me, or is the whole quick-cutting/fast-forward movement of characters getting REALLY old?! I mean honestly, how many times can you get 'freaked out' by seeing someone stand still for a silent moment, then suddenly thrust their hand up on a mirror with the fast-forward effect? The first I remember seeing this in was Resident Evil, where the camera cut suddenly to the little red girl with her hand on the glass and her eyes open. I've seen it in almost every single big-name horror movie since then, though, and these pathetic attempts at portraying a shattered psyche or frenetic movements are getting REALLY lame. Doesn't anyone recognize a tired device anymore? A good example of this is during the scene where the main character tries to revive a little kid (why he passed out and was suddenly covered in ash makeup, I couldn't say). Cheesy glow-in-the-dark spider veins showed up all over his body for no reason, and the camera suddenly goes on a frenzy, darting into one of the veins and then careening around wildly inside the kid's blood vessels. We see a shirt button fall 'ominously' through the darkness and slice several ribbons, and then we cut to a mosquito sucking blood from a transluscent pool. Wow, great stuff guys. Suddenly the kid is revived, and he doesn't seem the least bit surprised that he's suddenly now a ghoul, or 'Other' (original, huh). As for the action sequences, there were none. I don't recall a single fight, save for the ultra-cheesy medieval swordfight in the beginning (and replayed during the end for the climax). Bunch of the cast dressed up in either fur or silver armor, running at each other with swords. Wow. Epic, lemme tell ya. Oh, and there's the climactic fight - the villain pulls his spine out of his back (in a cheesy sequence with obvious dyed rubber) and doesn't do a damn thing with it. This villain and the main character have perhaps the lamest sword duel ever captured on film. It cuts between the main character weilding a massive blacklight bulb like a maniac, to the villain slamming his sword into the ground over and over. Isn't this guy supposed to be the king of darkness or something? And wasn't he an accomplished warlord? His swordsmanship was totally unconvincing, not to mention the fact that neither sword actually seemed to clash during the duel - they just dodged and swung, repeatedly. There's no resolution to this either - the little kid mentioned earlier just runs into the fray and suddenly the fight stops, and it's revealed that the child has strayed onto the dark path. It really took a lot for me to finish this flim, because I desperately wanted to turn it off about halfway through...but I just had to see what all the hype was about, and form my own honest opinion. In summation, I honestly don't see a single redeeming quality in this - hell, at least underworld had monsters and action. This is basically just a bad plot with some ultra-cheesy 'new-wave' horror effects thrown in as (bad) eye candy.

643941,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B00005JOYL,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[1, 2]","""For it is easier to kill the Light within oneself, than to scatter the Darkness around. The prophecies are coming true...""So goes one of the most stirring lines of ""Night Watch,"" a tight, atmospheric, slightly surreal fantasy that has the distinction of being one of the most successful movies in Russian history. Full of mages, shapeshifters and witches, this movie spins a compelling battle between good and evil. Think ""Star Wars,"" but with vampires.Long ago, two armies of powerful Others fough -- and came to a stalemate. To maintain the balance between the Light and Darkness, the Night Watch and Day Watch were created, to keep an eye on each other's sides. But it seems that the balance between good and evil is about to be tipped, by a prophesied Other who will choose one side.And now it seems to be happening: the prophesied boy has been found, and a vortex with a mystery girl is heading toward Moscow.  Anton (Konstantin Khabensky) has to find the boy and turn him toward the side of light, while repelling the Dark Ones. But he is not the only one, and soon the pact is cracking as both sides try to get the kid.Be warned: ""Night Watch"" doesn't really end so much as stop. There are two more movies -- one of which is already out in Eastern Europe -- which continue and finish the story. Remember ""Lord of the Rings""? It's like that, so don't expect everything neatly wrapped up at the end. It's has a satisfactory stopping place, but with lots of plot threads awaiting ""Day Watch.""In plot, it has the fantasy staples -- a prophecy, secret organizations, a savior, a reluctant hero, an ancient clash between good and evil. But it takes place in an urban-gothic Moscow full of the supernatural, but with the grimy, downbeat look that you'd expect from Moscow. It also gives an imaginative twist on the typical vampire legends. (Check out the Gloom!)Timur Bekmambetov is brilliant stylistically, with tense dialogue, bizarre (sometimes very gory) fights, and fast-moving action scenes. He seems to include anything he thinks is cool, which is fine for the witches, shapeshifters, and a dose of religious symbolism. But occasionally it's a drawback, since it doesn't really make sense that these uberpowerful heroes would need swords to fight the bad guys.Additionally, he can give twists to the typical, such as a fight between Anton and a Dark One, with both combatants in different realities and able to see each other only through broken mirrors. It's a wild scene, and one of the most suspenseful, unique action sequences you'll see for ages.Khabensky is a very solid actor, and he brings a pathos to Anton. The only problem is that it takes a long time for Anton to finally develop as a character, although it's worth waiting for. And while there are lots of supporting characters, Bekmambetov gives them weaknesses and quirks of their own, such as the owl-sorceress who seems to have a thing for Anton.Dark, grimy, explosive and very weird, ""Night Watch"" overflows with cinematic promise.

Generals Gesen and Zavulon command the forces of Others dedicated to Light and Darkness, respectively. On a bridge, the two armies meet, and a truce is struck to prevent to annihilation of all Others in that combat. Both sides wait for the birth of an Other whose choice of sides will decide the end to their struggle.In 1992, Anton, a mild mannered man, meets a modern witch in her apartment to have her cast a spell to retun his lost love to him. She warns him that his love is now pregnant with another man's child, and that this child will constantly draw Anton's love back to the other man, unless it is also destroyed. However, the witch will only attempt to destroy the child if Anton agrees to accept the responsibility of that act. In the botched process of casting the spell to destroy the unborn child, he awakes to the uneeen world around him, becoming an Other.In 2004, Anton has chosen the Light side, and is hunting vampires and other Dark siders in Moscow, using his special Gift as a Seer. Ironically, he lives next door to a vampire, and they share a wary but friendly relationship. Interestingly, the Light is in the habit of providing special licenses to Dark siders, allowing them to kill/feed/convert/etc., but each side polices the activities of the other to make certain that the Truce is never broken. During an intervention, Anton kills the vampire lover of a young girl, recently ""turned"", saving a young boy in the process, but effectively violating the peace. He also encounters Svetlana, something ""much worse than a vampire"", but who is wholly unaware of her role in apocalyptic events about to unfold.This unique film brings a Russian artistic and cultural approach to a story that seems straight out of a graphic novel. While the story itself may not be unique, seeming pretty much standard Gaiman or Vertigo fare, the production is stunning. The director uses camera angles, and incorporates photographic and artistic elements I've never seen, and the effect is enthralling. It's not a film based on big pyrotechnic explosions and gunfire, and the Special Effects aren't totally up to Dreamworks standards, but the film is a lush portrait of the struggle between good and evil, as well as the tendency of each walking those paths to cross over to the others point of view, that puts recent films of similar theme (Underworld 1/2, Constantine, Van Helsing) in 2nd place.",5,Now among my favorite films!,1147564800,"05 14, 2006",2006,2540,"['Others', 'are', 'wizards', 'sorcerers', 'witches', 'shapechangers', 'locked', 'combat', 'dedictaed', 'Light', 'Dark', 'Generals', 'Gesen', 'Zavulon', 'command', 'forces', 'Others', 'dedicated', 'Light', 'Darkness', 'respectively', 'bridge', 'two', 'armies', 'meet', 'truce', 'struck', 'prevent', 'annihilation', 'Others', 'combat', 'sides', 'wait', 'birth', 'Other', 'choice', 'sides', 'will', 'decide', 'end', 'struggle.In', '1992', 'Anton', 'mild', 'mannered', 'man', 'modern', 'witch', 'apartment', 'have', 'cast', 'spell', 'retun', 'lost', 'love', 'love', 'now', 'pregnant', 'man', 'child', 'child', 'will', 'constantly', 'draw', 'Anton', 'love', 'back', 'other', 'man', 'also', 'destroyed', 'However', 'witch', 'will', 'only', 'attempt', 'destroy', 'child', 'Anton', 'accept', 'responsibility', 'act', 'botched', 'process', 'casting', 'spell', 'destroy', 'unborn', 'child', 'uneeen', 'world', 'becoming', 'Other.In', '2004', 'Anton', 'chosen', 'Light', 'side', 'hunting', 'vampires', 'other', 'Dark', 'siders', 'Moscow', 'using', 'special', 'Gift', 'Seer', 'Ironically', 'next', 'door', 'vampire', 'share', 'wary', 'friendly', 'relationship', 'Interestingly', 'Light', 'habit', 'providing', 'special', 'licenses', 'Dark', 'siders', 'allowing', 'kill/feed/convert/etc.', 'side', 'activities', 'other', 'make', 'certain', 'Truce', 'never', 'broken', 'intervention', 'Anton', 'vampire', 'lover', 'young', 'girl', 'recently', 'turned', 'saving', 'young', 'boy', 'process', 'effectively', 'violating', 'peace', 'also', 'Svetlana', 'something', 'much', 'worse', 'vampire', 'who', 'wholly', 'unaware', 'role', 'apocalyptic', 'events', 'unfold.This', 'unique', 'film', 'Russian', 'artistic', 'cultural', 'approach', 'story', 'straight', 'graphic', 'novel', 'story', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'unique', 'seeming', 'pretty', 'much', 'standard', 'Gaiman', 'Vertigo', 'fare', 'production', 'stunning', 'director', 'camera', 'angles', 'photographic', 'artistic', 'elements', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'effect', 'enthralling', 'not', 'film', 'based', 'big', 'pyrotechnic', 'explosions', 'gunfire', 'Special', 'Effects', 'are', ""n't"", 'totally', 'up', 'Dreamworks', 'standards', 'film', 'lush', 'portrait', 'struggle', 'good', 'evil', 'as', 'well', 'tendency', 'walking', 'paths', 'cross', 'others', 'point', 'view', 'recent', 'films', 'similar', 'theme', 'Underworld', '1/2', 'Constantine', 'Van', 'Helsing', '2nd', 'place']",Nochnoy dozor

No one can win that battle and the forces keep truce controlling each other's actions during the Night and Day watch. Skip to Moscow, Russia of 2004 - the balance between the Dark and the Light is just about to collapse because the Chosen one who would either save the world if he joins the Light or destroy it if he goes with the dark forces has been born but does know his destiny yet. Sounds familiar, does it not? ""Lord of the Rings"", ""The Matrix"", ""Star Wars"" - yes, ""Night Watch"", the first entry in the trilogy brings to mind all these celebrated movies but it has very distinguished look and feel to it, ""horror-fantasy-down-and-dirty-Moscow-style"". The film also explores (at least it tries to) Mikhail Bulgakov's ""Master and Margarita"" territory and reminds of the popular Russian cult novel by Vladimir Orlov, ""Danilov the Violist"" in the way both beloved books combine bitter realism of life in Moscow with darkly humorous fantasy. I have to admit that I did not expect much but I was pleasantly surprised. The movie was entertaining, funny, and at the same time very dark, unsettling, and gripping. It is not a perfect movie (its director is a little too much in love with the MTV style camera movements and cuts) but it's got many interesting sequences and special effects. The B/W animated part was brilliant and it alone makes the film worth of watching.Some jokes are hilarious. My favorite was the one about two vampires that fell in love and wanted to enroll in the teaching college together.P.S.

And, for the light, the equivalent is the Nightwatch.12 years ago, a man named Anton made a malevolent deal with a witch. To regain his straying wife, he accepted the sin of the dark magic intended to consume his wife's unborn child, a child not his own. But agents of the Nightwatch arrived just in time and the foul act was aborted. Moments later, Anton's nascent precognitive abilities surfaced, his Otherness confirmed. The Nightwatch quickly brought him into the fold.Cut to the present. Anton, now a full-fledged Nightwatch member (never mind that his skills in field work are dubious), receives instructions to track down a boy mesmerized by a vampire. En route, he glimpses a girl on the subway and undergoes a shocking bout of clairvoyance. The Vortex of Damnation, the source of all Darkness, hovers above this cursed girl. A prophecy is recalled, proclaiming the arrival of a powerful entity who must decide between good and evil, of which choice will once and for all tip the balance towards one side. The final battle draws near.NIGHT WATCH is the aggresively-shot cinematic adaptation of Russian author Sergei Lukyanenko's popular contemporary dark fantasy novel, and it's fairly good and made a lot of rubles in its native box office. Despite its flaws, I quite enjoyed the movie experience and particularly appreciated the film's frenetic energy. NIGHT WATCH unveils a world become a feverish and apocalyptic nightmare - inhabited by vampires, magicians, bestial shapeshifters, and others of that supernatural ilk - and so what if the production values don't quite live up to the immense scale of the story? The actors are enthusiastic and the dark fantasy/horror elements are for the most part intriguingly envisioned (Anton's tension-wracked clash with the vampire lovers near the beginning is a must-see). A nice quirk is Anton's assigned partner Olga, who had just completed serving out 60 years of punishment trapped in the shape of an inanimate owl figure.The movie does suffer from an occasional lack of clarity, the storyline feeling somewhat scattershot. I kept my eye on the screen for every second, but I have a feeling I missed out on some of the nuances (I actually might have to read the book now). My confusion wasn't abated by the actors' lines which now and then proved to be incomprehensible, but my crappy ear for accents is probably at fault here. The camera work is gratifyingly, sometimes jarringly, hectic and is key to lending a deliciously gothic atmosphere, but it sometimes lapses into the amateurish; it's no biggie, though, and I liked the effort.Fans of fantasist Sergei Lukyanenko know that there are several sequels to Night Watch. So it's no real surprise that this flick ends without a definitive resolution. In fact, the ending ratchets up the intensity and heightens even further that already prevailing sense of foreboding. I've already ordered the film sequelDay Watch (Unrated), and I can't wait to watch it. But I should get a flashlight.",4,"""Your glimpses of the future won't help field work.""",1191110400,"09 30, 2007",2007,3286,"['Three', 'half', 'stars', 'NIGHT', 'WATCH.In', 'eternal', 'struggle', 'darkness', 'light', 'balance', 'must', 'be', 'maintained', 'Long', 'ago', 'pact', 'was', 'made', 'granted', 'person', 'free', 'will', 'choose', 'side', 'join', 'ensure', 'liberty', 'forces', 'darkness', 'assembled', 'Daywatch', 'light', 'equivalent', 'Nightwatch.12', 'years', 'ago', 'man', 'named', 'Anton', 'made', 'malevolent', 'deal', 'witch', 'regain', 'straying', 'wife', 'accepted', 'sin', 'dark', 'magic', 'intended', 'consume', 'wife', 'unborn', 'child', 'child', 'not', 'own', 'agents', 'Nightwatch', 'arrived', 'just', 'time', 'foul', 'act', 'was', 'aborted', 'Moments', 'later', 'Anton', 'nascent', 'precognitive', 'abilities', 'surfaced', 'Otherness', 'confirmed', 'Nightwatch', 'quickly', 'brought', 'fold.Cut', 'present', 'Anton', 'now', 'full-fledged', 'Nightwatch', 'member', 'never', 'mind', 'skills', 'field', 'work', 'are', 'dubious', 'instructions', 'track', 'down', 'boy', 'mesmerized', 'vampire', 'En', 'route', 'girl', 'subway', 'shocking', 'bout', 'clairvoyance', 'Vortex', 'Damnation', 'source', 'Darkness', 'hovers', 'cursed', 'girl', 'prophecy', 'recalled', 'proclaiming', 'arrival', 'powerful', 'entity', 'who', 'must', 'decide', 'good', 'evil', 'choice', 'will', 'once', 'tip', 'balance', 'one', 'side', 'final', 'battle', 'draws', 'near.NIGHT', 'WATCH', 'aggresively-shot', 'cinematic', 'adaptation', 'Russian', 'author', 'Sergei', 'Lukyanenko', 'popular', 'contemporary', 'dark', 'fantasy', 'novel', 'fairly', 'good', 'made', 'lot', 'rubles', 'native', 'box', 'office', 'flaws', 'quite', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'experience', 'particularly', 'appreciated', 'film', 'frenetic', 'energy', 'NIGHT', 'WATCH', 'world', 'become', 'feverish', 'apocalyptic', 'nightmare', 'inhabited', 'vampires', 'magicians', 'bestial', 'shapeshifters', 'others', 'supernatural', 'ilk', 'so', 'what', 'production', 'values', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'live', 'up', 'immense', 'scale', 'story', 'actors', 'are', 'enthusiastic', 'dark', 'fantasy/horror', 'elements', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'intriguingly', 'envisioned', 'Anton', 'tension-wracked', 'clash', 'vampire', 'lovers', 'beginning', 'must-see', 'nice', 'quirk', 'Anton', 'assigned', 'partner', 'Olga', 'who', 'had', 'just', 'completed', 'serving', 'out', '60', 'years', 'punishment', 'trapped', 'shape', 'inanimate', 'owl', 'figure.The', 'movie', 'suffer', 'occasional', 'lack', 'clarity', 'storyline', 'feeling', 'somewhat', 'scattershot', 'kept', 'eye', 'screen', 'second', 'have', 'feeling', 'missed', 'out', 'nuances', 'actually', 'might', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'now', 'confusion', 'was', ""n't"", 'abated', 'actors', 'lines', 'now', 'then', 'proved', 'be', 'incomprehensible', 'crappy', 'ear', 'accents', 'probably', 'fault', 'here', 'camera', 'work', 'gratifyingly', 'sometimes', 'jarringly', 'hectic', 'key', 'lending', 'deliciously', 'gothic', 'atmosphere', 'sometimes', 'amateurish', 'biggie', 'liked', 'effort.Fans', 'fantasist', 'Sergei', 'Lukyanenko', 'know', 'are', 'several', 'sequels', 'Night', 'Watch', 'real', 'surprise', 'flick', 'definitive', 'resolution', 'fact', 'ending', 'ratchets', 'intensity', 'heightens', 'even', 'further', 'already', 'prevailing', 'sense', 'foreboding', ""'ve"", 'already', 'ordered', 'film', 'sequelDay', 'Watch', 'Unrated', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'watch', 'should', 'get', 'flashlight']",Nochnoy dozor

Of course blood and all kinds of gross and other physical tortures and distortions and sufferings accumulate minute after minute, never ending, never coming to the slightest beginning of an end. They capture, because they have never lost it, the curse of a medieval vision in which evil is all powerful but cannot exist without good living next to it and fighting against it. Note good is submitted to the same curse. It is their vision of the world. Evil is necessary for the world to be able to survive its own menacing death, for anything not too bad to come out of the deeply bad witch's brew in a witch's pot history is. This vision is absolutely diabolically human. The devil is in man and man could not even exist if the devil was not in him. Some of the visual special effects are extremely good. Some others are more average. But I find it very funny to consider that your own backbone is your sword and that you can draw it to fight against - or is it for? - the existential survival of evil.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",4,There is no hope against evil: let's live with it,1201824000,"02 1, 2008",2008,1491,"['When', 'Russians', 'start', 'trying', 'get', 'world', 'fantasy', 'have', 'go', 'back', 'oldest', 'Slavonic', 'could', 'even', 'say', 'Lithuanian', 'old', 'Teutonic', 'Knights', 'would', 'have', 'said', 'possible', 'bring', 'life', 'present', 'so', 'well', 'so', 'intensely', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'real', 'reality', 'where', 'fiction', 'two', 'meanings', 'intended', 'course', 'blood', 'kinds', 'gross', 'other', 'physical', 'tortures', 'distortions', 'sufferings', 'accumulate', 'minute', 'minute', 'never', 'ending', 'never', 'coming', 'slightest', 'beginning', 'end', 'capture', 'have', 'never', 'lost', 'curse', 'medieval', 'vision', 'evil', 'powerful', 'can', 'not', 'exist', 'good', 'living', 'fighting', 'Note', 'good', 'submitted', 'same', 'curse', 'vision', 'world', 'Evil', 'necessary', 'world', 'be', 'able', 'survive', 'own', 'menacing', 'death', 'anything', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'come', 'deeply', 'bad', 'witch', 'brew', 'witch', 'pot', 'history', 'vision', 'absolutely', 'diabolically', 'human', 'devil', 'man', 'man', 'could', 'not', 'even', 'exist', 'devil', 'was', 'not', 'visual', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'extremely', 'good', 'others', 'are', 'more', 'average', 'find', 'very', 'funny', 'consider', 'own', 'backbone', 'sword', 'can', 'draw', 'fight', 'existential', 'survival', 'evil.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', 'Dauphine', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Versailles', 'Saint', 'Quentin', 'Yvelines']",Nochnoy dozor
643953,A2OLKV9F2S7O6N,B00005JOYL,James W. Picht,"[2, 6]","Night Watch is an interesting, imaginative film. The special effects are quite good by Russian film standards, though not particularly new or special by the standards of such films as The Matrix. They're prominent, but they don't drive the film, else it wouldn't be a particularly good film. What does drive the film are plot and an interesting premise.By now you know both plot and premise, so I won't bother providing a synopsis here. This film has at its core the struggle between good and evil (something we find in most of the literature ever written and most films ever made), but the relationship between the two is a bit unusual. The principal character for good (the Night Watch), Anton, lives across the hall from an agent of evil (the Day Watch) and is on rather chummy terms with him. When good and evil aren't engaged in apocalyptic struggle, they go after each other like bureaucrats and lawyers. An evil witch is arrested by the Night Watch and written up (complete with forms) for black magic against an innocent much like she might expect to be written up for hygiene violations in her restaurant kitchen. The dialogue is nearly along the lines of, ""what, a nice old lady like me? Anyway, this was entrapment!"" ""Yeh, yeh, tell it to the judge."" Anton creates a mini-crisis when, rather than arrest a vampire, he kills him. His Day Watch neighbor, also a vampire, is put out and affronted by this, not driven into a vengeful rage. Seldom has the war between good and evil seemed so civilized.This film is very Russian. The attitudes of the characters and the modus operendi of the Day and Night Watches have a certain post-Soviet weariness to them, a certain sense of sloppiness. The chuminess I noted above is part of that. If the war between good and evil is bureaucratic and tame, it's because both sides are morally lax. There's no sense of outrage for good or evil done, no sense that ends can't be justified by means. When a good but cursed woman seems set to set off the apocalypse, the leader of the Night Watch (a good guy, an agent of Light, remember) tells his operatives to find a way to lift the curse or kill her for the greater good. Agents of good and evil seem to operate on the basis of rational utilitarian concerns, not on irrational principle. It's a perspective that seems very much conditioned by Soviet theory and practice.Parts of the movie were confusing. Some sequences were so sudden or frenetic that I had no clue what had just happened. It's nice to be able to go back and rewatch them (though in a couple of cases I'm as baffled as I was the first time), but this is still confusing. There are some plot holes that are flung past us so quickly that the director may hope we don't notice, and in some cases he's probably right. There are some surprises that are entirely unsurprising (I figured out the identity of the Great Other and his or her (no spoilers from me) relationship to Anton before the Great Other even made it onto the screen), but there are also some genuine surprises and a few good startles.This isn't a bad film, and in some ways it's quite good. It's Russian. The DVD transfer isn't bad. What I hated about the DVD was that I couldn't figure out how to get Russian dialogue without subtitles, and I had to have English dubbing for several minutes before I got any Russian at all. That's just plain strange. I wouldn't have known I could get Russian language at all if another reviewer hadn't mentioned the problem - a few minutes into the film (before it made the transition) I just switched it to English and got rid of the subtitles. It's also annoying that there are no Russian subtitles. This is a general gripe for me with Russian film DVDs, since I like to show them to my Russian students and like them to be able to read the dialogue as they hear it. Are there no deaf Russians who watch these things?I'd give this film four stars, but that stupid business of having to have the first minutes in dubbed English and having to have the English subtitles in Russian costs it a star.",3,Four pony riders of the Apocalypse - a tiff between goodishness and sort of evil,1162339200,"11 1, 2006",2006,4054,"['Night', 'Watch', 'interesting', 'imaginative', 'film', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'Russian', 'film', 'standards', 'not', 'particularly', 'new', 'special', 'standards', 'such', 'films', 'Matrix', ""'re"", 'prominent', 'do', ""n't"", 'drive', 'film', 'else', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'particularly', 'good', 'film', 'What', 'drive', 'film', 'are', 'plot', 'interesting', 'premise.By', 'now', 'know', 'plot', 'premise', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bother', 'providing', 'synopsis', 'here', 'film', 'core', 'struggle', 'good', 'evil', 'something', 'find', 'most', 'literature', 'ever', 'written', 'most', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'relationship', 'two', 'bit', 'unusual', 'principal', 'character', 'good', 'Night', 'Watch', 'Anton', 'hall', 'agent', 'evil', 'Day', 'Watch', 'rather', 'chummy', 'terms', 'When', 'good', 'evil', 'are', ""n't"", 'engaged', 'apocalyptic', 'struggle', 'go', 'other', 'bureaucrats', 'lawyers', 'evil', 'witch', 'arrested', 'Night', 'Watch', 'written', 'up', 'complete', 'forms', 'black', 'magic', 'innocent', 'much', 'might', 'expect', 'be', 'written', 'up', 'hygiene', 'violations', 'restaurant', 'kitchen', 'dialogue', 'nearly', 'along', 'lines', 'what', 'nice', 'old', 'lady', 'Anyway', 'was', 'entrapment', 'Yeh', 'yeh', 'tell', 'judge', 'Anton', 'mini-crisis', 'when', 'rather', 'arrest', 'vampire', 'Day', 'Watch', 'neighbor', 'also', 'vampire', 'put', 'out', 'affronted', 'not', 'driven', 'vengeful', 'rage', 'Seldom', 'war', 'good', 'evil', 'seemed', 'so', 'civilized.This', 'film', 'very', 'Russian', 'attitudes', 'characters', 'modus', 'operendi', 'Day', 'Night', 'Watches', 'have', 'certain', 'post-Soviet', 'weariness', 'certain', 'sense', 'sloppiness', 'chuminess', 'noted', 'above', 'part', 'war', 'good', 'evil', 'bureaucratic', 'tame', 'sides', 'are', 'morally', 'lax', 'sense', 'outrage', 'good', 'evil', 'done', 'sense', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'justified', 'means', 'When', 'good', 'cursed', 'woman', 'set', 'set', 'off', 'apocalypse', 'leader', 'Night', 'Watch', 'good', 'guy', 'agent', 'Light', 'remember', 'operatives', 'find', 'way', 'lift', 'curse', 'kill', 'greater', 'good', 'Agents', 'good', 'evil', 'seem', 'operate', 'basis', 'rational', 'utilitarian', 'concerns', 'not', 'irrational', 'principle', 'perspective', 'very', 'much', 'conditioned', 'Soviet', 'theory', 'practice.Parts', 'movie', 'were', 'confusing', 'sequences', 'were', 'so', 'sudden', 'frenetic', 'had', 'clue', 'what', 'had', 'just', 'happened', 'nice', 'be', 'able', 'go', 'back', 'rewatch', 'couple', 'cases', ""'m"", 'as', 'baffled', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'still', 'confusing', 'are', 'plot', 'holes', 'are', 'flung', 'so', 'quickly', 'director', 'may', 'hope', 'do', ""n't"", 'notice', 'cases', 'probably', 'right', 'are', 'surprises', 'are', 'entirely', 'unsurprising', 'figured', 'out', 'identity', 'Great', 'Other', 'spoilers', 'relationship', 'Anton', 'Great', 'Other', 'even', 'made', 'screen', 'are', 'also', 'genuine', 'surprises', 'few', 'good', 'startles.This', ""n't"", 'bad', 'film', 'ways', 'quite', 'good', 'Russian', 'DVD', 'transfer', ""n't"", 'bad', 'What', 'hated', 'DVD', 'was', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'get', 'Russian', 'dialogue', 'subtitles', 'had', 'have', 'English', 'dubbing', 'several', 'minutes', 'got', 'Russian', 'just', 'plain', 'strange', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'known', 'could', 'get', 'Russian', 'language', 'reviewer', 'had', ""n't"", 'mentioned', 'problem', 'few', 'minutes', 'film', 'made', 'transition', 'just', 'switched', 'English', 'got', 'rid', 'subtitles', 'also', 'annoying', 'are', 'Russian', 'subtitles', 'general', 'gripe', 'Russian', 'film', 'DVDs', 'like', 'show', 'Russian', 'students', 'like', 'be', 'able', 'read', 'dialogue', 'hear', 'Are', 'there', 'no', 'deaf', 'Russians', 'who', 'watch', 'things', ""'d"", 'give', 'film', 'four', 'stars', 'stupid', 'business', 'having', 'have', 'first', 'minutes', 'dubbed', 'English', 'having', 'have', 'English', 'subtitles', 'Russian', 'costs', 'star']",Nochnoy dozor

A number of reviewers stand correct on this film regarding its ups and downs base on the production. There are a number of movies you can describe this to. To me personally it was a blend of `The Matrix,' a dash of `Constantine,' with a hint of `Under World,' place it the oven you get `Night Watch' done in one hour and fifty four minutes.It's hard to believe that this film was only done with $4 million, that's like pocket change compare to other production cost out there. To explain ""Night Watch' in its entirety would be pointless, only raising more question than answers. Then afterwards you would be looking at this review like I'm crazy.Unfortunately, the director is clearly a veteran of music videos, and he makes the action sequences hyper kinetic and often incoherent. When he does manage to create an alluring visual, he quick-cuts, and you wish he would've had the patience to hold some of the shots longer. This hectic visual style is evident in the plotting as well, which clearly is setting up for sequels with the introduction of many characters, though some of the subplots (especially involving the cursed virgin woman and her evil vortex) seemed unnecessary. Likewise, the rushed finale seemed oddly anti-climatic and didn't pack the wallop I feel the filmmakers intended.I'd never shook my head so much with a questionable look on my face on a film for quite some time. I also felt that they could have done a way better job towards the ending.

You know the kind: their plots spring from the premise that there's been an ages-long supernatural or futuristic-type war going on right under the noses of humanity, only we're not aloud, or are just too dumb, to see it.  Other examples of this growing sub-genre include ""Hellboy"", ""Constantine"", the ""Matrix"" trilogy, and the two ""Underworld"" films.This one's about ""good"" supernatural beings (who mostly seem to be shapeshifters and telepaths) versus ""bad"" supernatural beings (who mostly seem to be vampires).  There's an uneasy truce between both sides, rules of behavior that tend to get broken, and rumors of a ""chosen one"" who must pick a side in the ""coming war"" and ultimately tip the balance to one side or the other.  Yes, you've seen this sort of thing before.Moments of plot deja vu aside, I found this Russian-made movie generally imaginative and entertaining enough, but definitely not as amazingly good as all the hype a few years ago suggested it would be.  I did like it enough to want to eventually check out ""Day Watch"", the next installment, though I can't say I'm exactly going to rush out and get it.I can't resist this final quibble, however: wanting a fast pace for your movie is fine, but do you HAVE to generate that fast pace by employing that slick, hyper-fast MTV-style editing technique, laced with show-offy slo-mo and speeded-up visual flourishes?  Do people actually like this type of editing?  I guess some do.  Myself, I find it distracting, and certainly overused.The English dubbing job is very good, though.  When I perused the DVD viewing options, I chose to watch it that way instead of in the original Russian (also offered), as I didn't want to subject my wife to watching a geeky horror movie AND having to read sub-titles.

643965,AIIR8E34EDKCQ,B00005JOYL,- Kasia S.,"[2, 3]","Night Watch is a refreshing take on the good versus evil battle, without yawning anthologies and preaching as its concise, to the point and draws the watcher in and doesn't let go unless some scenes are so obscure that you need to pause the TV and sit there and ponder the images that seared the brain. It's part one of a grand trilogy taking place in modern Moscow, unknown's to the humans there, a breeding ground for shape shifters who can turn into bears and tigers, vampires, sinister cursed characters who tangle innocent people into the never ending battle between the lines of good and evil.The story starts off with a young man Anton, who visits an extremely creepy old woman in a red suit, who tells him that his wife is having an affair and that she bears a child that isn't his. Crimes of lust and passion aren't new but this take on them is quite extraordinary as he pays the witch to get the woman back and to abort the child. While she falls into a demon like trance he changes his mind and something weird happens as he sees invisible forces holding her down as she tries to slap her hands together to kill his child. He realizes that the traumatic experience in her house changes him forever, as the world is still weird and unchanged, but now visible to him in its pure and ancient form. From a visual view the movie is a work of art; a cinematic achievement that kept me bewildered and pondering each scene, as the most incredible things crept and crawled through it. Plastic dolls that grew legs of a spider, vortex of black crows circling over a building where a doomed and cursed woman lived, as everything she touched died and her role in this movie. Powerful warriors who pulled swords form the spinal cords and who fought battles against light wielding Others who believed in good, moving through a dark mist called the Gloom. It paralyzed its pray from inside out, sucking blood out of its veins through mosquitoes and hordes of warriors in their mythical costumes, with winged helmets battling on the bridge in Moscow but in a different universe unseen by regular humans.There is a tale of a special Other, a person who will tip the scales, as Anton gets involved he releases that the person who will influence man kind forever is tied to him and his past, and he must travel though obstacles greater than human mind can bear to get to the vortex and its final resolution. The images and fantasy in this movie were spellbinding and so well though out as the story was captivating and entertaining and certainly wild!The movie was superb, every angle and screen shot was perfect and amazing, the flying and fighting, the mystery and the creatures fed my eyes for two hours as I am impatiently awaiting the second installment of this amazing fairy tale like movie. In a nutshell this movie is about Anton and his group of fellow strange creatures who look like harmless humans who keep tabs on the evil ones, who try to trick the good side to commit crimes so great, that the best of the good ones will switch sides.

No, I mean it: this movie, spectacular to watch, makes The Matrix and Lord of the Rings look like rehearsals.  I don't think I've ever seen a movie so lush in graphic design, so thorough that I could vanish into its dreamlike environment with complete abandon.  I just wish it had a story as grand as its visuals.Loosely based on the first third of Sergei Lukenyenko'snovel of the same title, Night Watch spotlights a grunt soldier in a timeless war between Light and Darkness, fought amid the neon of post-Soviet Moscow.  At its best, it works like an abstract expressionist array of urban fantasy images that dazzle the senses and bewilder the imagination.  This must be a cinematographer's dream gig.But examined for narrative, the story relies on characters willing to obey the plot demands, nothing more.  Key actions only compute if characters know they're cast members in an ensemble drama.  Significant characters vanish from the story in the middle of a scene.  The climactic confrontation must only make sense in light of the sequel, which I haven't seen.  And the movie stops mid-action.Night Watch is clearly the prologue for a film series, and must be watched in those terms.  If you expect any plot threads to resolve, you have a long wait ahead of you.  It's gorgeous, but it's also relentlessly frustrating.

643970,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00005JOYL,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","There has certainly been a lot of effusive praise heaped on this film--the first of a trilogy. It's been dubbed an epic comparable to ""Lord of the Rings"" by Quentin Tarantino, no less. So when such bold praise is handed down--then, of course, comes the inevitable backlash.Well, this film is by no means the masterpiece some make it out to be. But neither is it the disaster others would have you believe.I won't go into the plot--it is what it is. You go with it or not. I heard one reviewer call the story a cross between ""Underworld"" and ""The Matrix""--and that description is as apt as any other. There are some interesting ideas presented and overall I enjoyed the story, though it's not without some missteps.What you definitely get is a cool looking film. The images are vibrant and well done, the effects and visuals are great. I watched the subtitled version (YOU SHOULD NEVER WATCH ANYTHING DUBBED, as far as I'm concerned) and I loved how they were incorporated into the movie. Very unusual, very cool. It was really a unique experience, in that regard.Overall, the movie was fun and entertaining. I'm not waiting at the edge of my seat for part two--but I'll give it a look when it comes out.

643973,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B00005JOYL,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[0, 0]","This is an original and strange but quite interesting Russian supernatural thriller. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.Once upon the time, in fact in medieval times, lived The Others, allied with the forces of either Light or Dark. The two factions got into it, hard, until Geser, the lord of Light, realized that the two forces are evenly matched and asked for a truce. Zavulon, the boss of the Darkness, agreed. From now on there would be no fighting and every Other would have free choice between Light and Darkness. Warriors of Light would form a Night Watch and Warriors of Darkness would become the Day Watch, in order to enforce the agreement. The truce endured ever since then - until now...This is just the introduction and I will say no more here about what happens in the film, except that the main ""hero"" is a man called Anton Gorodetsky, played by the excellent Russian actor Konstantin Khabensky (he also played amongst others the main character in ""Admiral""). With time Gorodetsky will become the object of great interest of both Night and Day Watch and he will discover a lot of troubling things about himself...This film will mostly appeal to all amateurs of fantastic, fantasy and horror films, as it is a good mixture of all three of them, giving as final result a kind of (very) dark fantasy. Its strongest point is its originality, as it is completely not Hollywoodian (for obvious reasons) and the action is situated in today's Russia, a premise in itself quite fascinating. It is also a strange and surprising film, taking us to a surrealistic ride of which we can not anticipate the final ending... But for the same reason it is also a little bit confusing by moments and I think that cutting like 5-8 minutes would do it some good, as some scenes are unnecessary and too long.Still, this is good, solid stuff, allowing fantasy afficionados to taste something else than the usual American fodder (which even if frequently good can get monotonous). I will have now to buy the sequel, called obviously ""The Day Watch"", to see how this whole story ends...

Fitzpatrick ""Mark Fitz""","[6, 8]","The theatrical release of Night Watch was a fantastic movie, containing Russian dialogue with the most unique subtitles I have ever seen. Unfortunately, Fox has only released this ""dumbed down"" version in the US. They pulled the same stunt with the Australian release, saying that they may release a special edition later. I own the UK release which is far superior to this one, offering the full russian with real subtitles, as well as a special disc that offers the theatrical subtitles. When I watched it in Russian it was very easy to follow the subtitles and the emotional tone that was provided in the Russian language edition truly helped the story. I wish the US release would offer this and let's hope that Fox agrees someday.The special effects in the movie are excellent. Other countries understand that special effects should add to the story, not become the story. If you only need someone to transform into a tiger for a couple seconds, then that's all you need. Too many American producers would milk it out far longer than it would be useful for just to get a certain level of coolness. The effects here are focused to adding to the story, not becoming it.This was a fantastic movie though it suffers from some re-editing and dialog that seems to have been changed for no reason even though the cultural idioms still work.Bottom line, rent it first. If you like it enough, buy this version.

Granted, stunning visuals will never take the place of a stunning plot, but in lieu of one, it's nice to have the other.The darkly lavish ""Night Watch"" is Russia's answer to the vampire movie, a twisted tale about the warring forces of Good and Evil and the hasty (and rather shaky) pact they made that allows them to operate within certain parameters without getting in each others' way.  These forces are known, collectively, as Others.At the start of the film, our lead, Anton Gorodetsky, enlists the help of a witch in an attempt to get his ex-wife to return to him, but the witch is stopped in mid-ritual by the Night Watch -- the ""Good"" Others -- because she lied to Anton about the circumstances of the spell (thus violating the ancient pact).  Anton is thrust maddeningly into this dark, tarry underworld, and he also discovers that he, too, is an Other.Anton chooses the side of Light and spends his life hunting down those Dark Others who are not abiding by the terms of the long-standing agreement between Good and Evil.  But the times, they are a-changing.  It seems a new Other has been born, one whose power will end the stalemate between Black and White and usher in a new era where the rules no longer apply.The rules, as they are, are vague anyway.  Anton's world is built on some presuppostions that many viewers (I, at least) may not be aware of.  And the cogs and wheels of the war between the two worlds turn according to a logic that isn't what you would call instantly familiar.  However, they also turn at a rambunctious pace, throwing off enough sparks to distract anyone from the story's odd structure, weird methodology, and gaping holes.Well-ventilated though the tale may be, the central mechanism of the plot is firmly in place, and is actually kind of heartbreaking.  Although there are elements that are superfluous (the character of Maxim Ivanovich), incongruous (the introductory scene), and vague (the video game fortune teller), the core storyline is satisfying enough.I get the impression that all of the weird, orbiting, and unconnected bits of plot would've made for a stronger story had the movie been extended to, say, three hours long (or made into a mini-series), giving the gaps time to be filled in.  Even as it stands, with a slim (and slightly shattered) story, the film is still, if nothing else, an amazing technical achievement.  Ignore the unfinished philosophical musings, relish the kaleidoscopic editing, and sit back with some popcorn.  It may be hard to understand at parts, but it's not at all hard to watch.",4,Black Light Beauty,1177286400,"04 23, 2007",2007,2699,"['anything', 'movies', '300', 'andThe', 'Matrixhave', 'taught', 'enough', 'movie', 'just', 'look', 'good', 'Granted', 'stunning', 'visuals', 'will', 'never', 'take', 'place', 'stunning', 'plot', 'lieu', 'one', 'nice', 'have', 'other.The', 'darkly', 'lavish', 'Night', 'Watch', 'Russia', 'answer', 'vampire', 'movie', 'twisted', 'tale', 'warring', 'forces', 'Good', 'Evil', 'hasty', 'rather', 'shaky', 'pact', 'made', 'operate', 'certain', 'parameters', 'getting', 'others', 'way', 'forces', 'are', 'known', 'collectively', 'Others.At', 'start', 'film', 'lead', 'Anton', 'Gorodetsky', 'help', 'witch', 'attempt', 'get', 'ex-wife', 'return', 'witch', 'stopped', 'mid-ritual', 'Night', 'Watch', 'Good', 'Others', 'lied', 'Anton', 'circumstances', 'spell', 'thus', 'violating', 'ancient', 'pact', 'Anton', 'thrust', 'maddeningly', 'dark', 'tarry', 'underworld', 'also', 'too', 'Other.Anton', 'side', 'Light', 'life', 'hunting', 'down', 'Dark', 'Others', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'abiding', 'terms', 'long-standing', 'agreement', 'Good', 'Evil', 'times', 'are', 'a-changing', 'new', 'Other', 'been', 'born', 'one', 'power', 'will', 'end', 'stalemate', 'Black', 'White', 'usher', 'new', 'era', 'where', 'rules', 'no', 'longer', 'apply.The', 'rules', 'are', 'are', 'vague', 'anyway', 'Anton', 'world', 'built', 'presuppostions', 'many', 'viewers', 'least', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'aware', 'cogs', 'wheels', 'war', 'two', 'worlds', 'turn', 'according', 'logic', ""n't"", 'what', 'would', 'call', 'instantly', 'familiar', 'However', 'also', 'turn', 'rambunctious', 'pace', 'throwing', 'off', 'enough', 'sparks', 'distract', 'anyone', 'story', 'odd', 'structure', 'weird', 'methodology', 'gaping', 'holes.Well-ventilated', 'tale', 'may', 'be', 'central', 'mechanism', 'plot', 'firmly', 'place', 'actually', 'kind', 'heartbreaking', 'are', 'elements', 'are', 'superfluous', 'character', 'Maxim', 'Ivanovich', 'incongruous', 'introductory', 'scene', 'vague', 'video', 'game', 'fortune', 'teller', 'core', 'storyline', 'satisfying', 'enough.I', 'get', 'impression', 'weird', 'orbiting', 'unconnected', 'bits', 'plot', 'would', ""'ve"", 'made', 'stronger', 'story', 'had', 'movie', 'been', 'extended', 'say', 'three', 'hours', 'long', 'made', 'mini-series', 'giving', 'gaps', 'time', 'be', 'filled', 'Even', 'slim', 'slightly', 'shattered', 'story', 'film', 'still', 'nothing', 'else', 'amazing', 'technical', 'achievement', 'unfinished', 'philosophical', 'musings', 'relish', 'kaleidoscopic', 'editing', 'sit', 'back', 'popcorn', 'may', 'be', 'hard', 'understand', 'parts', 'not', 'hard', 'watch']",Nochnoy dozor

This original but extremely strange Russian film was directed by Timur Bekmambetov, and has a sequel (""Day watch"") that allows us to follow the adventures of the characters.The main premise of this movie is that there are people with supernatural powers called ""Others"" that live among human beings. The ""Others"" are very different, and are neatly divided into the opposing forces of Light and Dark according to their characteristics and beliefs. The soldiers of Light (NightWatch) Project human beings, and the soldiers of Dark (DayWatch) prey on them. These two forces don't get on well with each other, but have striken an uneasy truce in order to survive. That truce won't last forever, though, as both sides are waiting for the person that will break the balance to be born and chose sides...

Although in the fantasy / horror genre, its style will endear it to others, in the same way `The Matrix' did.However, this is no clean cut Matrix style movie - though similarly ambitious in story, this is down and dirty.  The world contains The Others, people who though mortal have gifts, whether sorceresses, witches, mediums, vampires or whatever.  At some point in their life they have to choose to be part of the army of Dark, or part of the army of Light.  Through a prologue which sets this up, oddly spoken in English and looking like it uses leftover armour from Lord of the Rings, we see the dark and the light have formed a truce.  This story follows the Night Watch - these are Others who are of the Light, but during the night they check their counterparts do not break the truce.  In particular, it follows one man who following a meeting with someone that looks suspiciously like a Russian version of The Oracle from The Matrix, makes choices which threaten to upset the whole balance and truce.Music, acting, directing and art direction are all uniquely Russian and yet in quality are the match of any current Hollywood film.  There are quibbles - the parallels to Ghostbusters plot are distracting - the yellow emergency vehicle for getting fast to paranormal events, the vortex around the skyscraper which becomes the focus of the climax. On the other hand, the originality makes up for this - the occasional striking use of CGI, the lack of perfect ending that Hollywood would have provided, and most especially the subtitles!  The subtitles are a star in their own right and make the movie even more worth watching - if you get the two disc set make sure you watch the theatrical version, which has subtitles on screen.  They are in colour, they jump about the screen, they appear and disappear in unexpected ways..This is in short an original and imaginative movie in both style and substance - forget the language barrier and embrace something new!

I enjoyed it quite a bit -- a nice and inventive twist on supernatural/superhero/good vs. evil themed films, with the advantage that cultural differences between the United States and Russia make this one feel a bit more quirky than the usual fare.  While the film is obviously inspired by post-Matrix Hollywood sci-fi, its story and style are distinctive enough, and dark enough, to render it convincing that they come from a world apart from L.A., that conveys (in allegorical fashion) aspects of the tensions in Moscow that have emerged in the post-Soviet era.  The most obvious thematic connection to its time and place -- but one this film also has in common with the best American film-noir -- is the way in which the film shows it can't be taken for granted that the ""lawless"" are evil while the ""enforcers of law"" are good (even when they describe themselves in that way).  While the plot is not nearly as difficult to follow as some of the early reviews suggested, the film is at least willing (unlike many major Hollywood blockbusters) to assume that the audience is not composed of idiots who can't put two and two together.  Easily as enjoyable (and maybe a bit more profound, given that it plays with ambiguities more effectively and is more unpredictable and inventive) as films like ""Blade"" ""Blade II"" ""Hell Boy"",and even some of the Batman films, and much better than much more expensive films like ""Van Helsing"" or ""Chronicles of Riddick"".One thing I really liked about this film, that I haven't seen a lot of commentary on, is its inventive use of subtitles.  This is one of the first subtitled films I've seen to actually do something interesting with them -- to let them carry some of the weight of the design rather than merely slap them on over the top of the film.  Sometimes they change the color, to fit themes (e.g. red and dripping lettering, or blood red letters that dissipate like blood in water; or subtitles in other colors to match the composition of a shot), or they flicker or they are placed in different parts of the screen rather than merely at the bottom.  This is something you see in a few early silent films, where intertitles are sometimes used in interesting ways, but I don't recall seeing this in any foreign films with subtitles.",4,"Fun flick, with a very inventive use of subtitles",1150761600,"06 20, 2006",2006,2387,"[""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'comment', 'film', 'general', 'are', 'lots', 'reviews', 'have', 'already', 'done', 'enjoyed', 'quite', 'bit', 'nice', 'inventive', 'twist', 'supernatural/superhero/good', 'vs.', 'evil', 'themed', 'films', 'advantage', 'cultural', 'differences', 'United', 'States', 'Russia', 'make', 'one', 'feel', 'bit', 'more', 'quirky', 'usual', 'fare', 'film', 'obviously', 'inspired', 'post-Matrix', 'Hollywood', 'sci-fi', 'story', 'style', 'are', 'distinctive', 'enough', 'dark', 'enough', 'render', 'convincing', 'come', 'world', 'apart', 'L.A.', 'conveys', 'allegorical', 'fashion', 'aspects', 'tensions', 'Moscow', 'have', 'emerged', 'post-Soviet', 'era', 'most', 'obvious', 'thematic', 'connection', 'time', 'place', 'one', 'film', 'also', 'common', 'best', 'American', 'film-noir', 'way', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'taken', 'granted', 'lawless', 'are', 'evil', 'enforcers', 'law', 'are', 'good', 'even', 'when', 'describe', 'way', 'plot', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'difficult', 'follow', 'early', 'reviews', 'suggested', 'film', 'least', 'willing', 'many', 'major', 'Hollywood', 'blockbusters', 'assume', 'audience', 'not', 'composed', 'idiots', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'put', 'two', 'two', 'together', 'Easily', 'enjoyable', 'maybe', 'bit', 'more', 'profound', 'given', 'ambiguities', 'more', 'effectively', 'more', 'unpredictable', 'inventive', 'films', 'Blade', 'Blade', 'II', 'Hell', 'Boy', 'even', 'Batman', 'films', 'much', 'better', 'much', 'more', 'expensive', 'films', 'Van', 'Helsing', 'Chronicles', 'Riddick', 'thing', 'really', 'liked', 'film', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'lot', 'commentary', 'inventive', 'use', 'subtitles', 'one', 'first', 'subtitled', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'actually', 'do', 'something', 'interesting', 'let', 'carry', 'weight', 'design', 'rather', 'merely', 'slap', 'top', 'film', 'Sometimes', 'change', 'color', 'fit', 'themes', 'e.g', 'red', 'dripping', 'lettering', 'blood', 'red', 'letters', 'dissipate', 'blood', 'water', 'subtitles', 'other', 'colors', 'match', 'composition', 'shot', 'flicker', 'are', 'placed', 'different', 'parts', 'screen', 'rather', 'merely', 'bottom', 'something', 'see', 'few', 'early', 'silent', 'films', 'where', 'intertitles', 'are', 'sometimes', 'used', 'interesting', 'ways', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'seeing', 'foreign', 'films', 'subtitles']",Nochnoy dozor

643986,A3SU3TXON36T0X,B00005JOYL,"New Age of Barbarism ""zosimos""","[0, 1]","_Night Watch_  (_Nochnoi Dozor_) is a bizarre Russian film based on a series of novels which features an epic confrontation between the forces of Light and those of Darkness.  Apparently throughout history there have always been ""Others"", those possessed with supernatural powers (vampires, witches, shapeshifters), who must choose to fight on the side of Light or the side of Darkness.  However, at one point in time a confrontation occurred between these two forces in which armies of Light and Dark led by Generals Gesen and Zavulon fought on a bridge.  However, in order to prevent the complete destruction of all their forces the generals agreed on a truce.  Thus was born the ""night watch"" (the watch over the forces of darkness in the night by the forces of light) and the ""day watch"" (the watch over the forces of light in the day by the forces of darkness) to assure that all laws were followed by the Others and that the truce was not broken.  It is during a confrontation between these two forces that the hero Anton makes his appearance, is revealed as an Other, and chooses the side of Light.  Apparently, Anton had sought the services of a witch to bring his girlfriend back to him and to cause her to miscarry with another man's child; however, at just the moment she is casting her hex upon the child the ""night watch"" appears.  The movie features a dark atmosphere in which Anton must attempt to prevent a vampiress (whose vampire boyfriend he has killed) from sucking the blood of a young boy.  The movie also reveals an ancient curse placed upon a girl, Svetlana, which has caused a vortex to appear drawing all in her path to their destruction.  Ultimately however, the forces of Light must again confront the forces of Dark in an apocalyptic battle in which the chosen Other must choose between Light and Dark.  The movie is certainly strange and while the dubbing into English may appear cheesey, it nonetheless is highly entertaining.  For an apocalyptic Russian film with an eerie atmosphere of supernatural strangeness give it a try and you are sure to enjoy.",5,An Epic Confrontation between the Forces of Light and Those of Darkness.,1151884800,"07 3, 2006",2006,2084,"['_Night', 'Watch_', '_Nochnoi', 'Dozor_', 'bizarre', 'Russian', 'film', 'based', 'series', 'novels', 'epic', 'confrontation', 'forces', 'Light', 'Darkness', 'Apparently', 'history', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'Others', 'possessed', 'supernatural', 'powers', 'vampires', 'witches', 'shapeshifters', 'who', 'must', 'choose', 'fight', 'side', 'Light', 'side', 'Darkness', 'However', 'one', 'point', 'time', 'confrontation', 'occurred', 'two', 'forces', 'armies', 'Light', 'Dark', 'led', 'Generals', 'Gesen', 'Zavulon', 'fought', 'bridge', 'However', 'order', 'prevent', 'complete', 'destruction', 'forces', 'generals', 'agreed', 'truce', 'Thus', 'was', 'born', 'night', 'watch', 'watch', 'forces', 'darkness', 'night', 'forces', 'light', 'day', 'watch', 'watch', 'forces', 'light', 'day', 'forces', 'darkness', 'assure', 'laws', 'were', 'followed', 'Others', 'truce', 'was', 'not', 'broken', 'confrontation', 'two', 'forces', 'hero', 'Anton', 'appearance', 'revealed', 'Other', 'side', 'Light', 'Apparently', 'Anton', 'had', 'sought', 'services', 'witch', 'bring', 'girlfriend', 'back', 'cause', 'miscarry', 'man', 'child', 'however', 'just', 'moment', 'casting', 'hex', 'child', 'night', 'watch', 'movie', 'dark', 'atmosphere', 'Anton', 'must', 'attempt', 'prevent', 'vampiress', 'vampire', 'boyfriend', 'killed', 'sucking', 'blood', 'young', 'boy', 'movie', 'also', 'ancient', 'curse', 'placed', 'girl', 'Svetlana', 'caused', 'vortex', 'appear', 'drawing', 'path', 'destruction', 'Ultimately', 'however', 'forces', 'Light', 'must', 'again', 'confront', 'forces', 'Dark', 'apocalyptic', 'battle', 'chosen', 'Other', 'must', 'choose', 'Light', 'Dark', 'movie', 'certainly', 'strange', 'dubbing', 'English', 'may', 'appear', 'cheesey', 'nonetheless', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'apocalyptic', 'Russian', 'film', 'eerie', 'atmosphere', 'supernatural', 'strangeness', 'give', 'try', 'are', 'sure', 'enjoy']",Nochnoy dozor
643987,AB1UMC7SB9D7Z,B00005JOYL,"PolarisDiB ""dibness""","[6, 10]","I first heard about this movie from a review from the AV Club, which, though it wasn't exactly singing this movie's praises, still interested me because this movie is supposed to be a set-up for subsequent films in a series.  I think about book series like DragonLance and other fantasy-based stuff, and then anime series, and I thought it would be neat to see the beginning of a similar thing working with film.By the time the movie had ended, however, my feelings were mixed.  A few things just didn't sit right with me, and I didn't know whether or not I wanted to continue the series, considering I was roughly displeased with the characters we were presented.  However, the ending is one of those well-defined cliffhangers that of course has one begging for more despite himself.Honestly, however, it doesn't hold up well.  Everything this movie does sort of undermines itself in some way.  It's spectacularly visual... but too visual.  Quick-cut editing filled with striking digital effects is used even when unnecessary, thus making the moments that WOULD have been really cool and gripping just another part of movie.  It tries to have a strong theme about light and darkness, but really it just assumes too much about the audience: it never really shows until the end why light is ""good"" and darkness is ""bad"", it just assumes the audience assumes it... and honestly I didn't see why either side mattered, or why they were even fighting, any further than the opening narration just TOLD me they were.  Finally, they present the action through the experiences of a young man who has difficulty dealing with and understanding this new world he's thrown into (having discovered he's an ""Other"" later in life), but his ""confusion"" comes off more as stupidity, really... and that's the key problem with this movie.  Had this one character, apparently the main protagonist and the character we're supposed to think about, had one ounce of critical thinking skills, he could have reversed the entire storyline for all of the subsequent films.Once again we're presented with a film that is so familiar with genre conceits that it no longer takes the time to understand them, thus resulting in a story where next to nothing actually stands up to the question ""Why?""  Why was that sub-plot about the woman with the curse really there, anyway (besides that it makes a contrivance for the main guy to leave)?  Why did Bear and Tigercub just randomly decide to start making out and stop paying attention to that kid (besides that the story needed a way for the kid to leave)?  Why did we focus, or care, about that plane, and why wouldn't an airfield allow a DAMAGED PLANE to land (besides that it adds suspense to a part of the movie that doesn't need it)?  And, finally, why do we keep cutting to close-ups of... nothing?  An engine firing off, squeeling tires, sunglasses, ""cool"" imagery (besides the fact that it makes the movie ""kick butt"").  Why are they even ""light"" and ""dark"" at all (besides the fact that then we have a simple one-dimensional good-vs-evil narrative).All of these things and more would be acceptable, however, if they actually lead somewhere.  However, the one big subplot basically ends with, ""Okay I did it but I'm done now,"" and the main ""twist"" could have easily ended simply with, ""But that woman tricked me, so the decision was really out of my control.""  Oh gee, look at that, I just one-uped the main protagonist... the same guy who blindly follows almost every single thing everybody tells him to do, even when it's CLEARLY A TRAP.Yes, it might be fun to watch but it doesn't really stand up well to any second thoughts and probably even worse to second viewings.  If you want to enjoy this, which you can, just don't think about it after you're done.  It'll be better that way.A note on the DVD: I try to always watch a film in its original language with subtitles if needed.  This disc is double-sided with an English dub on one side and a Russian 5.1 Dolby track on the other.  However it's confusing because it starts out with an English narration, which confused me and had me playing around with language and subtitle options for a good while before I found out that I didn't need to.  Then the subtitles were annoying anyway, picking up the ""effects"" of the movie going on.  It was an interesting idea, but it made watching the movie just that much more tiresome to pick up the subtitles before they were faded, wiped, changed colors, or whatever out of sight.--PolarisDiB",2,"Fun, but doesn't hold up well.",1151625600,"06 30, 2006",2006,4510,"['first', 'heard', 'movie', 'review', 'AV', 'Club', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'singing', 'movie', 'praises', 'still', 'interested', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'set-up', 'subsequent', 'films', 'series', 'think', 'book', 'series', 'DragonLance', 'other', 'fantasy-based', 'stuff', 'then', 'anime', 'series', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'neat', 'see', 'beginning', 'similar', 'thing', 'working', 'time', 'movie', 'had', 'ended', 'however', 'feelings', 'were', 'mixed', 'few', 'things', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'sit', 'right', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'not', 'wanted', 'continue', 'series', 'considering', 'was', 'roughly', 'displeased', 'characters', 'were', 'presented', 'However', 'ending', 'one', 'well-defined', 'cliffhangers', 'course', 'one', 'begging', 'more', 'himself.Honestly', 'however', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'well', 'Everything', 'movie', 'sort', 'undermines', 'way', 'spectacularly', 'visual', 'too', 'visual', 'Quick-cut', 'editing', 'filled', 'striking', 'digital', 'effects', 'used', 'even', 'when', 'unnecessary', 'thus', 'making', 'moments', 'WOULD', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'cool', 'gripping', 'just', 'part', 'movie', 'have', 'strong', 'theme', 'light', 'darkness', 'really', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'audience', 'never', 'really', 'end', 'why', 'light', 'good', 'darkness', 'bad', 'just', 'audience', 'honestly', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'side', 'mattered', 'why', 'were', 'even', 'fighting', 'further', 'opening', 'narration', 'just', 'TOLD', 'were', 'Finally', 'present', 'action', 'experiences', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'difficulty', 'dealing', 'understanding', 'new', 'world', 'thrown', 'having', 'discovered', 'Other', 'later', 'life', 'confusion', 'off', 'more', 'stupidity', 'really', 'key', 'problem', 'movie', 'Had', 'one', 'character', 'apparently', 'main', 'protagonist', 'character', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'think', 'had', 'one', 'ounce', 'critical', 'thinking', 'skills', 'could', 'have', 'reversed', 'entire', 'storyline', 'subsequent', 'films.Once', 'again', ""'re"", 'presented', 'film', 'so', 'familiar', 'genre', 'conceits', 'no', 'longer', 'time', 'understand', 'thus', 'resulting', 'story', 'where', 'next', 'nothing', 'actually', 'up', 'question', 'Why', 'Why', 'was', 'sub-plot', 'woman', 'curse', 'really', 'there', 'anyway', 'contrivance', 'main', 'guy', 'leave', 'Why', 'did', 'Bear', 'Tigercub', 'just', 'randomly', 'decide', 'start', 'making', 'out', 'stop', 'paying', 'attention', 'kid', 'story', 'needed', 'way', 'kid', 'leave', 'Why', 'did', 'focus', 'care', 'plane', 'why', 'would', ""n't"", 'airfield', 'allow', 'DAMAGED', 'PLANE', 'land', 'suspense', 'part', 'movie', ""n't"", 'need', 'finally', 'why', 'do', 'keep', 'cutting', 'close-ups', 'nothing', 'engine', 'firing', 'off', 'squeeling', 'tires', 'sunglasses', 'cool', 'imagery', 'fact', 'movie', 'kick', 'butt', 'Why', 'are', 'even', 'light', 'dark', 'fact', 'then', 'have', 'simple', 'one-dimensional', 'good-vs-evil', 'narrative', '.All', 'things', 'more', 'would', 'be', 'acceptable', 'however', 'actually', 'lead', 'somewhere', 'However', 'one', 'big', 'subplot', 'basically', 'Okay', 'did', ""'m"", 'done', 'now', 'main', 'twist', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'ended', 'simply', 'woman', 'tricked', 'decision', 'was', 'really', 'control', 'Oh', 'gee', 'look', 'just', 'one-uped', 'main', 'protagonist', 'same', 'guy', 'who', 'blindly', 'almost', 'single', 'thing', 'everybody', 'do', 'even', 'when', 'CLEARLY', 'A', 'TRAP.Yes', 'might', 'be', 'fun', 'watch', ""n't"", 'really', 'stand', 'up', 'well', 'second', 'thoughts', 'probably', 'even', 'worse', 'second', 'viewings', 'want', 'enjoy', 'can', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'re"", 'done', ""'ll"", 'be', 'better', 'way.A', 'note', 'DVD', 'try', 'always', 'watch', 'film', 'original', 'language', 'subtitles', 'needed', 'disc', 'double-sided', 'English', 'dub', 'one', 'side', 'Russian', '5.1', 'Dolby', 'track', 'other', 'However', 'confusing', 'out', 'English', 'narration', 'confused', 'had', 'playing', 'language', 'subtitle', 'options', 'good', 'found', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'Then', 'subtitles', 'were', 'annoying', 'anyway', 'picking', 'up', 'effects', 'movie', 'going', 'was', 'interesting', 'idea', 'made', 'watching', 'movie', 'just', 'that', 'much', 'more', 'tiresome', 'pick', 'up', 'subtitles', 'were', 'faded', 'wiped', 'changed', 'colors', 'sight.', 'PolarisDiB']",Nochnoy dozor

I don't do plots but suffice it to say this one is a combo of thriller, comedy, and superb action sequences that astound.  The sfx are as good as anything Cameron or Industrial Light And Magic can conjure and the hero is anti-hero enough to attract both the youth of today and the old geezers like me.

My response: ""cue the animatronic spiders."" I didn't know how right I was.There is a shaky truce between the powers of light and the powers of darkness, reached after a long, very bloody battle over a bridge. For some reason, the powers of light and darkness, in the present day, both live and work in Moscow rather than worldwide. In the opening sequences of the movie, we meet Anton Gorodetsky (Sky. Plane. Girl.'s Konstantin Khabensky), just a regular guy until he's drafted into the Others' war through no fault of his own. Fast forward to 2004. Gorodetsky is twelve years older, and a foot soldier in Light's service. He gets an assignment from above to hunt down a pair Darks who are planning to kill a kid. He attempts to complete the mission and fails rather spectacularly, setting in motion events so monumental that his only solace is that things would have been a lot worse had he succeeded...There's a great, great premise here, and isolated pieces of the movie are done well. The screenplay, when it's not bogged down in its own sludge, is quite interesting, even if it's nakedly manipulative. But the little things-- you know, the ones the song says mean a lot-- will likely drive the viewer to distraction. Annoying overdone camerawork hasn't been this in style since Irreversible, and Night Watch does it even worse. The music is interesting at times, weirdly inappropriate in others. Some characters do their jobs well, others are either horribly acted, horribly written, or both.In short: it's a half-decent movie that could have been good, maybe even great. It manipulated me into wanting to see the second movie in the trilogy with a cliffhanger ending, but I think I'll wait for the DVD. ** ",3,Wait for the DVD.,1142208000,"03 13, 2006",2006,1903,"['Nochnoi', 'Dozor', 'Timur', 'Bekmambetov', '2004', 'were', 'driving', 'theatre', 'see', 'chap', 'was', 'said', ""'d"", 'read', 'Timur', 'Bekmambetov', 'being', 'referred', 'Russian', 'Roger', 'Corman', 'response', 'cue', 'animatronic', 'spiders', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'right', 'shaky', 'truce', 'powers', 'light', 'powers', 'darkness', 'reached', 'long', 'very', 'bloody', 'battle', 'bridge', 'reason', 'powers', 'light', 'darkness', 'present', 'day', 'live', 'work', 'Moscow', 'rather', 'worldwide', 'opening', 'sequences', 'movie', 'meet', 'Anton', 'Gorodetsky', 'Sky', 'Plane', 'Girl', 'Konstantin', 'Khabensky', 'just', 'regular', 'guy', 'drafted', 'Others', 'war', 'fault', 'own', 'Fast', 'forward', '2004', 'Gorodetsky', 'twelve', 'years', 'older', 'foot', 'soldier', 'Light', 'service', 'assignment', 'hunt', 'down', 'pair', 'Darks', 'who', 'are', 'planning', 'kill', 'kid', 'complete', 'mission', 'rather', 'spectacularly', 'setting', 'motion', 'events', 'so', 'monumental', 'only', 'solace', 'things', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'worse', 'had', 'succeeded', 'great', 'great', 'premise', 'here', 'isolated', 'pieces', 'movie', 'are', 'done', 'well', 'screenplay', 'when', 'not', 'bogged', 'down', 'own', 'sludge', 'quite', 'interesting', 'even', 'nakedly', 'manipulative', 'little', 'things', 'know', 'ones', 'song', 'mean', 'lot', 'will', 'likely', 'drive', 'viewer', 'distraction', 'Annoying', 'overdone', 'camerawork', ""n't"", 'been', 'style', 'Irreversible', 'Night', 'Watch', 'even', 'worse', 'music', 'interesting', 'times', 'weirdly', 'inappropriate', 'others', 'characters', 'do', 'jobs', 'well', 'others', 'are', 'horribly', 'acted', 'horribly', 'written', 'both.In', 'short', 'half-decent', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'maybe', 'even', 'great', 'manipulated', 'wanting', 'see', 'second', 'movie', 'trilogy', 'cliffhanger', 'ending', 'think', ""'ll"", 'wait', 'DVD', '**']",Nochnoy dozor

These are the stars of 2004's Russian made Nochnoy Dozor...or to us Capitalist Pigs, Night Watch.By 2005, Night Watch was the highest grossing Russian film ever made....which speaks volumes about the number of movies that come out of Russia and their quality.Night Watch wasn't a great movie. Night Watch was indeed a good movie, but, man, is it ever good to speak English if you're a film buff that enjoys mostly Hollywood. I don't know how non-English speaking countries don't get tired of reading the subtitles or listening to stiffly dubbed US movies. I went with the subtitles for Night Watch, and by the end of the movie I had a headache.I don't know if all subtitled films are doing this now because I don't watch many, but in Night Watch the subtitles are sometimes ""integrated"" into the movie as an effect. Sometimes they float around the screen; sometimes they evaporate as a bloody mist; sometimes they flicker...I'm sure that reading this it sounds annoying (or the cause of my headache), but it was actually kind of cool. And the translations were modern slang instead of deadpan.The sound is great (5.1). The picture is great. Much higher quality than expected from a foreign film. The film is mostly dark lending a comicbookesque/graphic novel atmosphere. The movie looks like it cost a lot more than the worldwide $33MM it grossed. But, hey, prices are a bit different 'over there.'For those that haven't already deduced from the product description, Night Watch is a Vampire movie...a Guardians of the Light versus the Gloom, if you will. And the story, while familiar, has enough uniqueness to make it certainly worth a try. But, oy, Night Watch is the first in a trilogy, which means two more subtitle headaches are on the way (one of which, Day Watch, is already available on foreign region DVD that won't play on most US DVD players).So if you can deal with subtitles (or poorly dubbed dialogue), and you're into the genre, slip into the Gloom and visit this place that only the Others can go.

Aside from anything, the film looks and feels great, and the director's attention to detail goes beyond the abilities of most other reviewers to even notice, or correctly spell their criticism.  One of the most compelling features of the film is its subtitles.  This is not a film to be lazily viewed in a dubbed version, as the subtitles themselves are a major work of art and the innovative technique will be ripped off constantly over the next few years.  The subtitles are an integral part of the film's plot, the words dissolving into blood as a character bleeds, or appearing with a cursor as a computer is utilized on-screen.  At one point the subtitles even pulse in and out to the rhythm of a faltering vampire heartbeat.About the movie, well it's a vampire flick, basically.  There are other dimensions filled with horrible brutes most of us cannot, and would not want to perceive.  There is a great Russian Batmobile, it's a lumbering army truck with flames shooting out of the exhaust.  Some of the scenes are positively mesmerizing, such as a vampire's view of a boy's skull as a network of blood vessels something akin to an MRI.  The cuts are rapid, and jump back and forth between the perspectives of different characters.

644005,A171FU7AC9YYMS,B00005JOYL,"Steve Forsyth ""sforsythnoe""","[9, 21]","NIGHT WATCH may have been done in by its own marketing campaign.  Sold to the West as Russia's surprise blockbuster hit with fantastic effects, big-budget flare, and the first part of a planned trilogy or even quadrolgy, the film had its bar raised so high that it ultimately could not reach it in the eyes of this viewer.I will give them credit for their two main strengths - 1) there are some nice shots and FX in the movie, and 2) there is a whole world created here with plenty of fuel for the planned trilogy.However, as many nice moments and plot-points as there are, they do not add up to a total satisfying experience.  Either the problem lies with this film being aimed at a Russian audience with a different palate for movie exposition, or the filmmakers are just not able to completely immitate what they have seen from the west.As a Westerner, I was looking for much more excitement - the action of this movie is shot in a grand STYLE, but is not present in the same ABUNDANCE required for the Blockbusters we are used to here.  As such, the film's few action scenes are pretty boring - reminiscent of a movie from about 20 years ago with some cool elements, but without the means or budget to give them life.Furthermore, there is just no way to really understand what is going on in each scene.  A fault in the translation, perhaps, but half of the dialogue makes no sense.  The overall thread of the story makes sense ultimately, but it took a long time to follow what was going on in each individual scene.Then there are some just plain bad mistakes - such as a point in which an owl turns into a woman who seems to have not been human for over 60 years.  As such, we spend a few minutes watching her try to understand what plumbing and soap are for - only to have her emerge from her bath a few seconds later and state, ""Oh - I've been aching for a hot shower for 60 years!""  For the remainder of the movie, she seems to know more about her surroundings and what's going on than the hero himself does.Then, the full nature of the supernatural beings is never quite understandable.  Are they created as ""Others,"" or do they start as human and then BECOME Others after a pivotal event occurs?  If they are now supernatural, why do they still bleed, sleep, and eat?  Why are the sometimes visible and sometimes not?  We see that they are always fighting - but over what?As for characters and developement - it is non-existent.  Aside from the main hero, every other character is just in the background - and there are ALOT of characters who had potential to be great - but they simply have few lines and few memorable moments in the movie. In the end, you don't remember any of them - they were just there.At the end of the movie (if you are still awake), you may be interested enough to anticipate the coming sequels.  I myself am not, considering that the director himself admits that the first film was made for a Russian audience, then surprised him by finding a national audience, and now demanding the new movies consider the global audience.  A further complication is that the third of the series is expected to be produced IN ENGLISH by FOX Studios.  All this means that the three movies are unlikely to have a common feel or direction, but will be influenced by changing demographics, and the interference of a western production studio with their own mentalities.By and large, this movie had potential, but is ultimately just a conglomeration of ideas taken from better American movies such as UNDERWORLD and BLADE.  And when I can say that THOSE two movies are ""better"" - well, that's just sad!",2,Overhyped example of a foreign film market trying to imitate American-Style Blockbuster films,1151712000,"07 1, 2006",2006,3619,"['NIGHT', 'WATCH', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'own', 'marketing', 'campaign', 'Sold', 'West', 'Russia', 'surprise', 'blockbuster', 'hit', 'fantastic', 'effects', 'big-budget', 'flare', 'first', 'part', 'planned', 'trilogy', 'even', 'quadrolgy', 'film', 'had', 'bar', 'raised', 'so', 'high', 'ultimately', 'could', 'not', 'reach', 'eyes', 'viewer.I', 'will', 'give', 'credit', 'two', 'main', 'strengths', '1', 'are', 'nice', 'shots', 'FX', 'movie', '2', 'whole', 'world', 'created', 'here', 'plenty', 'fuel', 'planned', 'trilogy.However', 'many', 'nice', 'moments', 'plot-points', 'are', 'do', 'not', 'add', 'up', 'total', 'satisfying', 'experience', 'problem', 'film', 'being', 'aimed', 'Russian', 'audience', 'different', 'palate', 'movie', 'exposition', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'just', 'not', 'able', 'completely', 'immitate', 'what', 'have', 'seen', 'west.As', 'Westerner', 'was', 'looking', 'much', 'more', 'excitement', 'action', 'movie', 'shot', 'grand', 'STYLE', 'not', 'present', 'same', 'ABUNDANCE', 'required', 'Blockbusters', 'are', 'used', 'here', 'such', 'film', 'few', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'pretty', 'boring', 'reminiscent', 'movie', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'cool', 'elements', 'means', 'budget', 'give', 'life.Furthermore', 'just', 'way', 'really', 'understand', 'what', 'going', 'scene', 'fault', 'translation', 'perhaps', 'half', 'dialogue', 'sense', 'overall', 'thread', 'story', 'sense', 'ultimately', 'took', 'long', 'time', 'follow', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'individual', 'scene.Then', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'bad', 'mistakes', 'such', 'point', 'owl', 'woman', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'human', '60', 'years', 'such', 'spend', 'few', 'minutes', 'watching', 'try', 'understand', 'what', 'plumbing', 'soap', 'are', 'only', 'have', 'emerge', 'bath', 'few', 'seconds', 'later', 'state', 'Oh', ""'ve"", 'been', 'aching', 'hot', 'shower', '60', 'years', 'remainder', 'movie', 'know', 'more', 'surroundings', 'what', 'going', 'hero', 'does.Then', 'full', 'nature', 'supernatural', 'beings', 'never', 'quite', 'understandable', 'Are', 'created', 'Others', 'do', 'start', 'human', 'then', 'BECOME', 'Others', 'pivotal', 'event', 'occurs', 'are', 'now', 'supernatural', 'why', 'do', 'still', 'bleed', 'sleep', 'eat', 'Why', 'are', 'sometimes', 'visible', 'sometimes', 'not', 'see', 'are', 'always', 'fighting', 'what', 'characters', 'developement', 'non-existent', 'Aside', 'main', 'hero', 'other', 'character', 'just', 'background', 'are', 'ALOT', 'characters', 'who', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'great', 'simply', 'have', 'few', 'lines', 'few', 'memorable', 'moments', 'movie', 'end', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'were', 'just', 'there.At', 'end', 'movie', 'are', 'still', 'awake', 'may', 'be', 'interested', 'enough', 'anticipate', 'coming', 'sequels', 'am', 'not', 'considering', 'director', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'Russian', 'audience', 'then', 'surprised', 'finding', 'national', 'audience', 'now', 'demanding', 'new', 'movies', 'consider', 'global', 'audience', 'further', 'complication', 'third', 'series', 'expected', 'be', 'produced', 'IN', 'ENGLISH', 'FOX', 'Studios', 'three', 'movies', 'are', 'unlikely', 'have', 'common', 'feel', 'direction', 'will', 'be', 'influenced', 'changing', 'demographics', 'interference', 'western', 'production', 'studio', 'own', 'mentalities.By', 'large', 'movie', 'had', 'potential', 'ultimately', 'just', 'conglomeration', 'ideas', 'taken', 'better', 'American', 'movies', 'such', 'UNDERWORLD', 'BLADE', 'when', 'can', 'say', 'THOSE', 'two', 'movies', 'are', 'better', 'well', 'just', 'sad']",Nochnoy dozor

Neill,"[0, 0]","...of a movie lightened up with a good dose of Russian humor.Since pre-history, Others have existed on Earth in their own secret world, Light ones energized by Light and protecting Good - and unsuspecting humans - and Dark ones feeding on Darkness and promoting Evil. All have some super power: telepathic visions, telekinesis, shape-shifting. Some are vampires. All have the right to choose between Darkness and Light. In ancient times, the two sides engaged in violent conflict for World domination.  Now they live in a truce so tense and fragile that ""Watches"" have been set up to protect it: agents of Light guard on the Night Watch against harm (such as a vampire bite that will turn a human into a Dark Other) to humans, while agents of Dark take over on the Day Watch to protect their own selfish interests from Light Others. But soon in Moscow, the truce may be broken forever when a boy named Yegor, who will develop powers never seen before, makes his choice (this is serious stuff...).Meanwhile, Anton - played by Russian mega-star Konstantin Khabensky - has been dumped by his wife. He puts the World on a path to destruction when he asks a witch/Dark Other to help him get her back. Turns out that the unsuspecting Anton is an Other too, a seer who chooses the Light. Twelve years later, he's a Night Watch agent, using his visions to hunt vampires. He has to drink blood in order to do his job, and spends his off hours wallowing in guilt and vodka over his past and wondering if he chose the Light against his destiny. He's smart and brave, but bumbles around in an alcoholic's fog and doesn't always do his job well. Khabensky makes him endearingly goofy and very sexy.This movie is an amazing overload for the senses, moving so fast through its complex plot and eye-popping - yet very believable - special effects that it's hard to understand in one viewing.

644010,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00005JOYL,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[2, 4]","""Night Watch"" (""Nochnoi Dozor""), a new Russian film, blends elements of horror, thriller and fantasy creating a truly different story. The first entry of a proposed trilogy, ""Night Watch"" is a visually interesting, imperfect film. As the story progresses, through two more films, I anticipate many more layers of story, character and action will be revealed based on the promise of this first entry.In 1992, Anton (Konstantin Kabensky) visits a local `witch'. He wants the woman to help him win his estranged pregnant wife back; she recently left him and he is having trouble coping with the loss. The `witch' tells Anton that she can help him, but his wife's illegitimate child will be lost. He consents. Before the meeting ends, Anton will learn he is an ""Other"", one of a group of creatures who help keep the balance between good and evil. Twelve years later, Anton has joined the Night Watch, the group of Others who oversee the night, and all things light and good. This group spar with Day Watch, the Others who protect all things bad or dark. Oh, and Anton is now a vampire.I could go on and on, describing every aspect of this tale, such as the shape shifters, a cursed woman who could unknowingly cause the Apocalypse, vampires hunting a twelve year old boy, and more. But if I did so, a lot of the surprise, magic and interest in the tale would be lost. A large part of our ability to suspend disbelief rides on our ability to be surprised. If you aren't surprised, you are probably anticipating something and comparing it to real life. It is better for you to be surprised.On paper, it sounds like a mess, but strangely, oddly, inconceivably, it works. While far from a perfect film, the alternate universe created here is well-defined and makes sense based on the parameters established by the writer and director Timur Bekmambetov. Clearly, ""Watch"" isn't going to depict a real time and place. But the director establishes this time and place well. There are moments which don't make sense, detracting from the overall quality of the project, but these are few and far between.Given the circumstances, all of the characters are suitably dour and depressed. Locked in an epic battle, I imagine they have little time for fun or jokes. Anton is a particularly interesting character. As a vampire, he would naturally need blood in order to survive. But as he is a member of the Night Watch, he seems determined to drink pig blood, staying away from humans, something the vampires of Day Watch have no trouble with. As he struggles with this seemingly self-enforced character trait, he serves as a sort of foot soldier for his group, helping them find people, dealing with problems. His current assignment is to help them find a 12 year old boy who is receiving the calling, from the Day Watch to come and join them. Of course, the little boy has no idea what that means, but the Night Watch have to stop him before he makes it.Because the film was shot in Russia, the settings are unique and foreign, adding to the `alternate reality' view they present. Because the typical Russian lives in conditions a couple of grades below what most of us are used to, this adds to the feel of the film, giving the characters more desperation, less comfort. They live in small, dark, cluttered apartments. If the power goes out, they simply adapt because they are used to it. It doesn't even occur to them that the power outage might be a sign of something more serious. They drive old cars and trucks. There clothes are dark and slightly worn out. To us, everything people living in Moscow deal with on a daily basis seems like a prop or set decoration in a film about the Apocalypse.Director Bekmambetov has occasional flashes of brilliance. In one scene, Anton finds himself battling two vampires from the Day Watch for the 12 year old boy. These Day Watch vampires can only be seen consistently in mirrors. But when the one large mirror in the old warehouse is broken, Anton can no longer see the male who is attacking him. He grabs a large shard of mirror and holds it close to his face, swirling around, looking for his attacker. This scene is quite interesting, almost brilliant in execution. One problem with the film is some of the guidelines established are inconsistent. Later, the female vampire is seen without the aid of mirrors.Less successful are scenes of the leader of the Day Watch using a video game for training purposes. Images of the video game are cut into scenes of the leader practicing sword moves. The figures in the video game look remarkably similar to this character and it almost seems like a plug for a video game tie in. Unfortunately, the game is featured a few times, detracting from the film.As this is a Russian film, there are subtitles. For the American release, Fox Searchlight has added an English language introduction and coda, to help orient the viewers. Also, many of the subtitles seem to be integrated into the image. For instance, when the 12 year old boy hears the calling, the subtitles mysteriously drift away, much like the woman's voice he hears. It's a nice touch.This is a film that will require you to suspend disbelief. If you are willing to do that, you should enjoy the ride. If you are expecting to watch a realistic drama featuring recognizable American actors, you will be disappointed.",4,Come To Me...,1141948800,"03 10, 2006",2006,5345,"['Night', 'Watch', 'Nochnoi',

644011,A96JD9312DHWC,B00005JOYL,"TorridlyBoredShopper ""T(to the)B(to the)S""","[3, 4]","There are creatures amongst us, some light and some dark, committed to a truce to end an otherwise catastrophic form of eternal conflict. Enter the Night Watch, the guardians that keep the Dark in check, and the Day Watch, that do the reverse. Both sides await the coming of a prophesized ""other"" who will choose his prospective side and shift this otherwise eternal variation of static warfare, however, and the time seems to be coming soon. Enter Anton, a seemingly innocuous man with a love he wants to preserve, who is told that his love is pregnant - that the child is not his - and that the only way his love can be preserved is through the death of an innocent. Reluctantly Anton agrees to this but, in the midst of the witchery, the Night Watch comes in and stops the procedure. In the middle of that, Anton finds out that he is what is referred to as one of The Others; that things are happening around him, that he can see things that were previously unseen and do things in conjunction with either the light or the dark, and that he is changed.And the story begins building from there.While the DVD version of the movie isn't very popular, this is actually a really unique take on the world of the supernatural. Vampirism is explained here, shapeshifters are seen, and some of the strangest clashes between Light/Dark cultures are explored by Anton and the characters around him. This makes for a great story that keeps on keeping on, dragging itself deeper and deeper into a world that seems so alien when setting side-by-side with our own. I liked that; there was a lot of time spent building a world inside the world but there wasn't a lot of time spent dumbing it down so a viewer could watch it. It simply is the way it is, it has the rules it has, and the ""why"" isn't always explained. This, combined with the fact that we see the coming of the other and w also witness how the ripples of one action melds into a forest of other actions, really makes a person watch.As Anton himself says, ""curse"" isn't simply a word.The other thing about the movie is the visuals, which are absolutely mindblowing. Some of the things that happen are simply amazing, either by conflict or by the traversing of something called ""the gloom,"" and then there is the bigger saga that simply looks good while the movie plays out. The whole of the movie looks good, too, from the beginning shots that explain the battle between the forces to series where Anton is simply ""looking"" at a boy while trying to follow him. Perhaps it was because the movie was Russian or perhaps it was because some people found the format of the tale unappealing - it was more of a chapter than a complete tale, but the chapter was self-contained and told a story all its own -  or the unheralded release of the movie made it unappealing. Whatever the reason, this movie should have gotten a lot more acknowledgement than it did because the storyline and the visuals combine to make something grand.Again, this is a really interesting tale and would be good for anyone that wants something different from the obvious stories set to supernatural tones. The one thing to keep in mind is that the disc is double-sided and one side is dubbed and the other side is in Russian (with subtitles). I'm personally a fan of original language movies so I'm glad I noticed the Russian side of the movie, but I could see how this could confuse (and turn people off to the movie). The disc also comes with an extended ending with optional commentary and ""sneak peaks"" of the sequels.It really is worth the watch - and a bit more.",5,Accidents Speak Louder than Words,1187308800,"08 17, 2007",2007,3586,"['are', 'creatures', 'light', 'dark', 'committed', 'truce', 'end', 'otherwise', 'catastrophic', 'form', 'eternal', 'conflict', 'Enter', 'Night', 'Watch', 'guardians', 'keep', 'Dark', 'check', 'Day', 'Watch', 'do', 'reverse', 'sides', 'await', 'coming', 'prophesized', 'other', 'who', 'will', 'choose', 'prospective', 'side', 'shift', 'otherwise', 'eternal', 'variation', 'static', 'warfare', 'however', 'time', 'be', 'coming', 'soon', 'Enter', 'Anton', 'seemingly', 'innocuous', 'man', 'love', 'preserve', 'who', 'told', 'love', 'pregnant', 'child', 'not', 'only', 'way', 'love', 'can', 'be', 'preserved', 'death', 'innocent', 'Reluctantly', 'Anton', 'midst', 'witchery', 'Night', 'Watch', 'stops', 'procedure', 'middle', 'Anton', 'out', 'what', 'referred', 'one', 'Others', 'things', 'are', 'happening', 'can', 'see', 'things', 'were', 'previously', 'unseen', 'do', 'things', 'conjunction', 'light', 'dark', 'changed.And', 'story', 'building', 'DVD', 'version', 'movie', ""n't"", 'very', 'popular', 'actually', 'really', 'unique', 'take', 'world', 'supernatural', 'Vampirism', 'explained', 'here', 'shapeshifters', 'are', 'seen', 'strangest', 'clashes', 'Light/Dark', 'cultures', 'are', 'explored', 'Anton', 'characters', 'great', 'story', 'keeping', 'dragging', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'world', 'so', 'alien', 'when', 'setting', 'side-by-side', 'own', 'liked', 'was', 'lot', 'time', 'spent', 'building', 'world', 'world', 'was', ""n't"", 'lot', 'time', 'spent', 'dumbing', 'down', 'so', 'viewer', 'could', 'watch', 'simply', 'way', 'rules', 'why', ""n't"", 'always', 'explained', 'combined', 'fact', 'see', 'coming', 'other', 'w', 'also', 'witness', 'how', 'ripples', 'one', 'action', 'forest', 'other', 'actions', 'really', 'person', 'watch.As', 'Anton', 'curse', ""n't"", 'simply', 'word.The', 'other', 'thing', 'movie', 'visuals', 'are', 'absolutely', 'mindblowing', 'things', 'happen', 'are', 'simply', 'amazing', 'either', 'conflict', 'traversing', 'something', 'called', 'gloom', 'then', 'bigger', 'saga', 'simply', 'good', 'movie', 'out', 'whole', 'movie', 'good', 'too', 'beginning', 'shots', 'explain', 'battle', 'forces', 'series', 'where', 'Anton', 'simply', 'looking', 'boy', 'trying', 'follow', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'movie', 'was', 'Russian', 'perhaps', 'was', 'people', 'found', 'format', 'tale', 'unappealing', 'was', 'more', 'chapter', 'complete', 'tale', 'chapter', 'was', 'self-contained', 'told', 'story', 'own', 'unheralded', 'release', 'movie', 'made', 'unappealing', 'Whatever', 'reason', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'gotten', 'lot', 'more', 'acknowledgement', 'did', 'storyline', 'visuals', 'combine', 'make', 'something', 'grand.Again', 'really', 'interesting', 'tale', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'anyone', 'something', 'different', 'obvious', 'stories', 'set', 'supernatural', 'tones', 'one', 'thing', 'keep', 'mind', 'disc', 'double-sided', 'one', 'side', 'dubbed', 'other', 'side', 'Russian', 'subtitles', ""'m"", 'personally', 'fan', 'original', 'language', 'movies', ""'m"", 'glad', 'noticed', 'Russian', 'side', 'movie', 'could', 'see', 'how', 'could', 'confuse', 'turn', 'people', 'movie', 'disc', 'also', 'extended', 'ending', 'optional', 'commentary', 'sneak', 'peaks', 'sequels.It', 'really', 'watch', 'bit', 'more']",Nochnoy dozor

There is so much awesomeness in this movie, that you can almost feel the rest of the trilogy building as this first installment goes on.  The story is so well crafted, the action so exhilarating, and the themes and concepts put forth so fresh that the few flaws are easily brushed aside in favor of total immersion into this new world. The story centers around the war between light and dark.  The light side has a special organization, Night Watch, who monitor the dark ones even as the dark side's own Day Watch monitors them.  Both sides have the goal of maintaining peace and order as each man and woman is free to choose which side they will follow.  Needless to say, the truce between the two sides is tentative at best. Each member of the supernatural light/dark battle is referred to as an ""Other"" and they include in their ranks witches, vampires, shapeshifters and all of the other usual horror fare.  They all have the ability to slip into an alternate dimension known as ""The Gloom"" which makes them invisible to the real world except for their reflection in mirrors.  This is used to create some mind-bogglingly awesome and creepy shots.  The characters are many, interesting, and instantly accessible.  Each has a great story behind them, but most are sorely underdeveloped.  This, I'm sure, will be remedied in the next installment.  I mean, how could you not want to see more of a villain who pulls a sword out of his own spine?  Then there's the sexy were-tiger girl (don't blink or you'll miss her awesome tranformation) and a pop-diva who doubles as a Day Watch warrior.  Heck, there's a character who can supposedly change into a bear and it is never even shown in the film.  But you know what they say in show business:  always leave the audience wanting more.  Well, they certainly succeeded on that front.  The best thing about this genre-defying epic is that it really does feel like the tip of the iceberg.  The only true flaw that this film has is some very bad quick-cutting during the action sequences that can be very confusing.  That's pretty much it.  The rest is pure gold as far as I'm concerned.  There is also a wealth of deleted scenes that are well worth watching as they help flesh out the story. In fact, I don't think I've ever seen a DVD with more deleted scenes that I wished had stayed in the film.  If you've been looking for something different and mind-blowing in the horror/sci-fi/fantasy genre then you would be a fool to pass this film by.",5,Absolutely incredible genre-busting film.,1146441600,"05 1, 2006",2006,2717,"['easier', 'man', 'destroy', 'Light', 'defeat', 'darkness', 'Night', 'Watch', 'closest', 'film', 'come', 'Matrix', 'completely', 'knocking', 'ass', 'fisrt', 'viewing', 'so', 'much', 'awesomeness', 'movie', 'can', 'almost', 'feel', 'rest', 'trilogy', 'building', 'first', 'installment', 'story', 'so', 'well', 'crafted', 'action', 'so', 'exhilarating', 'themes', 'concepts', 'put', 'forth', 'so', 'fresh', 'few', 'flaws', 'are', 'easily', 'brushed', 'aside', 'favor', 'total', 'immersion', 'new', 'world', 'story', 'centers', 'war', 'light', 'dark', 'light', 'side', 'special', 'organization', 'Night', 'Watch', 'who', 'monitor', 'dark', 'ones', 'even', 'dark', 'side', 'own', 'Day', 'Watch', 'monitors', 'sides', 'have', 'goal', 'maintaining', 'peace', 'order', 'man', 'woman', 'free', 'choose', 'side', 'will', 'follow', 'Needless', 'say', 'truce', 'two', 'sides', 'tentative', 'best', 'member', 'supernatural', 'light/dark', 'battle', 'referred', 'Other', 'include', 'ranks', 'witches', 'vampires', 'shapeshifters', 'other', 'usual', 'horror', 'fare', 'have', 'ability', 'slip', 'alternate', 'dimension', 'known', 'Gloom', 'invisible', 'real', 'world', 'reflection', 'mirrors', 'used', 'create', 'mind-bogglingly', 'awesome', 'creepy', 'shots', 'characters', 'are', 'many', 'interesting', 'instantly', 'accessible', 'great', 'story', 'most', 'are', 'sorely', 'underdeveloped', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'be', 'remedied', 'next', 'installment', 'mean', 'how', 'could', 'not', 'want', 'see', 'more', 'villain', 'who', 'sword', 'own', 'spine', 'Then', 'sexy', 'were-tiger', 'girl', 'do', ""n't"", 'blink', ""'ll"", 'miss', 'awesome', 'tranformation', 'pop-diva', 'who', 'Day', 'Watch', 'warrior', 'Heck', 'character', 'who', 'can', 'supposedly', 'change', 'bear', 'never', 'even', 'shown', 'film', 'know', 'what', 'say', 'show', 'business', 'always', 'leave', 'audience', 'wanting', 'more', 'Well', 'certainly', 'succeeded', 'front', 'best', 'thing', 'genre-defying', 'epic', 'really', 'feel', 'tip', 'iceberg', 'only', 'true', 'flaw', 'film', 'very', 'bad', 'quick-cutting', 'action', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'confusing', 'pretty', 'much', 'rest', 'pure', 'gold', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'also', 'wealth', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'help', 'flesh', 'out', 'story', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'DVD', 'more', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'wished', 'had', 'stayed', 'film', ""'ve"", 'been', 'looking', 'something', 'different', 'mind-blowing', 'horror/sci-fi/fantasy', 'genre', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'fool', 'pass', 'film']",Nochnoy dozor

644016,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JOYL,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 2]","Based on the bestselling fantasy novels by Sergei Lukyanenko who also co-wrote the script, `NOCHNOI DOZOR' (`Night Watch') is the first of the epic fantasy trilogy. Director Timur Bekmambetov, one of the new wave directors from Russia, has actually worked under Roger Corman, king of B-films when he directed an exploitation film named `Arena' in 2001 shot in Russia. That means Bekmambetov is no stranger to the grammars of entertaining B-movies: more actions at the expense of sophisticated storytelling.Actually, the story about the two conflicting sects of the `Others' - humans with supernatural powers - is sometimes hard to follow, but the film's visuals manage to keep entertaining us. After the opening sequence with a bloody medieval battle between the forces of Light and Darkness, we are told that a shaky truce has been kept for more than 1,000 years.But the uneasy peace between the two forces is about to be broken in modern Moscow when one ordinary-looking boy is hypnotized and lured by a seductive voice calling `Come to me.' One `Night Watch' (`Light' members monitoring the activities of the Darkness) named Anton (Konstantin Khabensky) tries to stop the mysterious scheme, which leads him to the gory fights between him and very violent Vampire Andrei.[VISUALS & SUBTITLES] The film is full of (or overcrowded with) visual ideas done by Russian CGI technicians who have shown impressive skills here. You witness each and every movement of a metal rivet falling from the airplane; Anton's aide Olga who is turned into an owl; a lady whose curse unwittingly causes a huge vortex in the sky of Moscow; or a blood-sucking female roaming in the midnight tunnel barefoot. Many parts are left unexplained (who is the guy who overturned the truck?), and the visual images are not exactly all refreshing, but it is undeniable that each image has power of its own, which makes up for the lack of skilled storytelling. Even the English subtitles are unique, occasionally turning red or bigger according to the scenes without detracting our attentions from the film's content.It was about 25 years when Vladimir Menshov, who plays the role of Geser, Anton's boss here, directed critically acclaimed `Moscow Does Not Believe in Tears' (1979) which went on to become the Oscar winner for Foreign Language Film. Now he is this Russian answer to the Hollywood's alternative world, presented by 20th Century Fox Searchlight. Surely Russia has changed.Whether or not this trilogy can be called a success depends on the quality of the sequels. So we must wait for the second and third installments `Day Watch' and `Dusk Watch.' The results could be either better than expected, or perhaps disappointing. Whatever they would be, it remains true that `Night Watch' is a promising start for the new cinematic movement in Russia.",4,'The Light' vs 'The Darkness': Visually Unique First Chapter of Russian Epic Fantasy,1145750400,"04 23, 2006",2006,2827,"['Based', 'bestselling', 'fantasy', 'novels', 'Sergei', 'Lukyanenko', 'who', 'also', 'co-wrote', 'script', 'NOCHNOI', 'DOZOR', 'Night', 'Watch', 'first', 'epic', 'fantasy', 'trilogy', 'Director', 'Timur', 'Bekmambetov', 'one', 'new', 'wave', 'directors', 'Russia', 'actually', 'worked', 'Roger', 'Corman', 'king', 'B-films', 'when', 'directed', 'exploitation', 'film', 'named', 'Arena', '2001', 'shot', 'Russia', 'Bekmambetov', 'stranger', 'grammars', 'entertaining', 'B-movies', 'more', 'actions', 'expense', 'sophisticated', 'storytelling.Actually', 'story', 'two', 'conflicting', 'sects', 'Others', 'humans', 'supernatural', 'powers', 'sometimes', 'hard', 'follow', 'film', 'visuals', 'manage', 'keep', 'entertaining', 'opening', 'sequence', 'bloody', 'medieval', 'battle', 'forces', 'Light', 'Darkness', 'are', 'told', 'shaky', 'truce', 'been', 'kept', 'more', '1,000', 'uneasy', 'peace', 'two', 'forces', 'be', 'broken', 'modern', 'Moscow', 'when', 'one', 'ordinary-looking', 'boy', 'hypnotized', 'lured', 'seductive', 'voice', 'calling', 'Come', 'One', 'Night', 'Watch', 'Light', 'members', 'monitoring', 'activities', 'Darkness', 'named', 'Anton', 'Konstantin', 'Khabensky', 'stop', 'mysterious', 'scheme', 'gory', 'fights', 'very', 'violent', 'Vampire', 'Andrei', '[', 'VISUALS', 'SUBTITLES', 'film', 'full', 'overcrowded', 'visual', 'ideas', 'done', 'Russian', 'CGI', 'technicians', 'who', 'have', 'shown', 'impressive', 'skills', 'here', 'witness', 'movement', 'metal', 'rivet', 'falling', 'airplane', 'Anton', 'aide', 'Olga', 'who', 'turned', 'owl', 'lady', 'curse', 'unwittingly', 'huge', 'vortex', 'sky', 'Moscow', 'blood-sucking', 'female', 'roaming', 'midnight', 'tunnel', 'barefoot', 'Many', 'parts', 'are', 'left', 'unexplained', 'who', 'guy', 'who', 'overturned', 'truck', 'visual', 'images', 'are', 'not', 'exactly', 'refreshing', 'undeniable', 'image', 'power', 'own', 'up', 'lack', 'skilled', 'storytelling', 'Even', 'English', 'subtitles', 'are', 'unique', 'occasionally', 'turning', 'red', 'bigger', 'according', 'scenes', 'detracting', 'attentions', 'film', 'content.It', 'was', '25', 'years', 'when', 'Vladimir', 'Menshov', 'who', 'role', 'Geser', 'Anton', 'boss', 'here', 'directed', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'Moscow', 'Does', 'Not', 'Believe', 'Tears', '1979', 'went', 'become', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Foreign', 'Language', 'Film', 'Now', 'Russian', 'answer', 'Hollywood', 'alternative', 'world', 'presented', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'Searchlight', 'Surely', 'Russia', 'changed.Whether', 'not', 'trilogy', 'can', 'be', 'called', 'success', 'quality', 'sequels', 'must', 'wait', 'second', 'third', 'installments', 'Day', 'Watch', 'Dusk', 'Watch', 'results', 'could', 'be', 'either', 'better', 'expected', 'perhaps', 'disappointing', 'would', 'be', 'true', 'Night', 'Watch', 'promising', 'start', 'new', 'cinematic', 'movement', 'Russia']",Nochnoy dozor
644017,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B00005JOYL,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[1, 1]","Based upon a novel by Sergei Lukyanenko, NIGHTWATCH is an action-packed, cinematically illuminating film from Russia about the individual decisions that people make and how those choices and affect the struggle between good and evil.  The movie begins with a prologue explaining that there people who live in the world who resemble humans, but are not.  These people are known as Others.  The exist in our world, but also live in a plane separate from it. Others have an incredibly long lifespan and have powers.  Wizards and witches, sorcerers and shapeshifters, and other such creatures are all Others.As the prologue explains, the Others belong to one of two sides: Light and Dark.  Light Others seek to help humanity and coexist in peace while Dark Others seek to torment and plague humanity and use humans as a means for gaining power.  Over a millennia before, the Light and Dark faced each other in a deadly battle.  Both sides were evenly matched and to save the lives of those that weren't killed, a truce was formed.  Dark Others who make sure the Light follows the truce are known as the Day Watch, while Light others who make sure the Dark keeps the truce are known as Night Watch.NIGHT WATCH follows the story of a particular member of the Night Watch.  In 1992, Anton Gorodetsky discovers that his wife has been having an affair and wants to divorce him.  He seeks out the aid of a witch to get back at the man who has wrecked his life.  He is informed by the woman that his wife is pregnant and that she can get rid of the child, but only if Gorodetsky is willing to take the responsibility of the action upon himself.  Gorodetsky seems to assume that the child isn't his and agrees.  However, before the deed can be finished, the Night Watch arrives to arrest the witch and saves the child.  Gorodetsky is amazed at the people he sees and learns then that he is an Other.The movie fast forwards twelve years later. Gorodetsky is now a valuable member of the Night Watch and is on the prowl seeking to save a young boy from being eaten by a couple of vampires.  The boys' name is Yegor and after a violent battle Gorodetsky learns that Yegor is actually his son.  While trying to protect his son from revenge, Gorodetsky also become entangled with a woman name Svetlana (Mariya Poroshina) who has been cursed and is a part of the key that will bring about Armageddon.  The film builds until a climatic battle upon the rooftop of a Moscow apartment building where the fate of the world is decided by the choices of Gorodetsky.What makes NIGHT WATCH so interesting to watch isn't the plot.  There are countless movies about ""others"" living among us and the strains they go through to co-exist and the constant struggle between good and evil.  What DOES make NIGHT WATCH an interesting and fascinating movie is the cinematography.  The film has some breathtaking and amazing images.  Some of these shots were done using traditional old school film techniques, but many of them were done using computer effects.  The result is a film that doesn't look anything like a traditional Hollywood big budget fantasy/action picture and stands on its own as an example of the power of the medium.  Some of the shots appear so simple, but when viewed again one can is overwhelmed by the complexity.NIGHT WATCH was a huge film in Russia and during the year of its release became the largest grossing Russian film ever (until that record was broken by a different movie a year later).  Ironically, the film doesn't look anything like a typical big budget Hollywood film, but was protested by the group ""Padonki"" for being too American and Hollywood.Highly recommended for any person who considers themselves a student of film or for people that like Russian and/or fantasy films.",5,Come Out of the Twilight,1198627200,"12 26, 2007",2007,3778,"['Based', 'novel', 'Sergei', 'Lukyanenko', 'NIGHTWATCH', 'action-packed', 'cinematically', 'illuminating', 'film', 'Russia', 'individual', 'decisions', 'people', 'make', 'how', 'choices', 'affect', 'struggle', 'good', 'evil', 'movie', 'prologue', 'explaining', 'people', 'who', 'live', 'world', 'who', 'resemble', 'humans', 'are', 'not', 'people', 'are', 'known', 'Others', 'exist', 'world', 'also', 'live', 'plane', 'separate', 'Others', 'have', 'incredibly', 'long', 'lifespan', 'have', 'powers', 'Wizards', 'witches', 'sorcerers', 'shapeshifters', 'other', 'such', 'creatures', 'are', 'Others.As', 'prologue', 'Others', 'belong', 'one', 'two', 'sides', 'Light', 'Dark', 'Light', 'Others', 'seek', 'help', 'humanity', 'coexist', 'peace', 'Dark', 'Others', 'seek', 'torment', 'plague', 'humanity', 'use', 'humans', 'means', 'gaining', 'power', 'millennia', 'Light', 'Dark', 'faced', 'other', 'deadly', 'battle', 'sides', 'were', 'evenly', 'matched', 'save', 'lives', 'were', ""n't"", 'killed', 'truce', 'was', 'formed', 'Dark', 'Others', 'who', 'make', 'sure', 'Light', 'truce', 'are', 'known', 'Day', 'Watch', 'Light', 'others', 'who', 'make', 'sure', 'Dark', 'truce', 'are', 'known', 'Night', 'Watch.NIGHT', 'WATCH', 'story', 'particular', 'member', 'Night', 'Watch', '1992', 'Anton', 'Gorodetsky', 'wife', 'been', 'having', 'affair', 'divorce', 'out', 'aid', 'witch', 'get', 'back', 'man', 'who', 'wrecked', 'life', 'informed', 'woman', 'wife', 'pregnant', 'can', 'get', 'rid', 'child', 'only', 'Gorodetsky', 'willing', 'take', 'responsibility', 'action', 'Gorodetsky', 'assume', 'child', ""n't"", 'However', 'deed', 'can', 'be', 'finished', 'Night', 'Watch', 'arrest', 'witch', 'child', 'Gorodetsky', 'amazed', 'people', 'then', 'Other.The', 'movie', 'fast', 'forwards', 'twelve', 'years', 'later', 'Gorodetsky', 'now', 'valuable', 'member', 'Night', 'Watch', 'prowl', 'seeking', 'save', 'young', 'boy', 'being', 'eaten', 'couple', 'vampires', 'boys', 'name', 'Yegor', 'violent', 'battle', 'Gorodetsky', 'Yegor', 'actually', 'son', 'trying', 'protect', 'son', 'revenge', 'Gorodetsky', 'also', 'become', 'entangled', 'woman', 'name', 'Svetlana', 'Mariya', 'Poroshina', 'who', 'been', 'cursed', 'part', 'key', 'will', 'bring', 'about', 'Armageddon', 'film', 'climatic', 'battle', 'rooftop', 'Moscow', 'apartment', 'building', 'where', 'fate', 'world', 'decided', 'choices', 'Gorodetsky.What', 'NIGHT', 'WATCH', 'so', 'interesting', 'watch', ""n't"", 'plot', 'are', 'countless', 'movies', 'others', 'living', 'strains', 'go', 'co-exist', 'constant', 'struggle', 'good', 'evil', 'What', 'DOES', 'make', 'NIGHT', 'WATCH', 'interesting', 'fascinating', 'movie', 'cinematography', 'film', 'breathtaking', 'amazing', 'images', 'shots', 'were', 'done', 'using', 'traditional', 'old', 'school', 'film', 'techniques', 'many', 'were', 'done', 'using', 'computer', 'effects', 'result', 'film', ""n't"", 'look', 'anything', 'traditional', 'Hollywood', 'big', 'budget', 'fantasy/action', 'picture', 'own', 'example', 'power', 'medium', 'shots', 'appear', 'so', 'simple', 'when', 'viewed', 'again', 'one', 'can', 'overwhelmed', 'complexity.NIGHT', 'WATCH', 'was', 'huge', 'film', 'Russia', 'year', 'release', 'became', 'largest', 'grossing', 'Russian', 'film', 'ever', 'record', 'was', 'broken', 'different', 'movie', 'year', 'later', 'Ironically', 'film', ""n't"", 'look', 'anything', 'typical', 'big', 'budget', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'was', 'protested', 'group', 'Padonki', 'being', 'too', 'American', 'Hollywood.Highly', 'recommended', 'person', 'who', 'student', 'film', 'people', 'like', 'Russian', 'and/or', 'fantasy', 'films']",Nochnoy dozor

644025,A145CT70T2SB51,B00005JOYL,Zekeriyah,"[3, 3]","Based off a successful series of books (which I have, unfortunately, yet to read), Night Watch is part of a planned triology of movies detailing the struggles of The Others - supernatural creatures like vampires, werewolves, witches and stranger creatures that lurk, hidden amongst the mortal populace. Long ago, the armies of the Dark Others (who would exalt in their powers and enslave humanity) and the Light Others (who sought to protect humanity) fought each other to a standstill. On that day, they agreed to an ancient pact whereby the two forces would police each other. Set in modern day Moscow, this movie (and the sequel Day Watch) successful capture the feel of urban Russia.The story revolves around Anton, an alcoholic Light Other who serves on the 'Night Watch' (policing the Dark Others). While on the trail of a pair of vampires, Anton runs across a woman who is surrounded by a dark vortex, which may affect the entire world! Behind the scenes, the action is overshadowed by the figures of Gesser (leader of the Light Others) and  Zavulon (ruler of the Dark Others). The story is quite richly detailed and elaborate (hey, it IS Russian after all) and the action goes by very quickly, but you will get sucked into the plot. Despite the supernatural elements, and the brilliant special effects, these are actually fairly understated. Nonetheless, this is one of the most brilliant applications of the supernatural that I've ever seen in a film.For those who want to see a new direction in Sci-Fi, Horror and Fantasy, I strongly recommend checking this film out, along with it's sequel 'Day Watch' and the forthcoming 'Twilight Watch.' Especially if you are a fan of Russian/Eastern European film-making. I only wish more American film-makers would take a cue from Moscow and make movies this good!
