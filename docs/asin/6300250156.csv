I watched this video after viewing a History channel program on the legend of Bruce Lee.The theme song is a faint watered echo of a 007 soundtrack.  The stripper was fat.  The dubbed voices were something else...and, who wrote that dialogue? The ending is extraordinarily similar to ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" filmed two years previously.  The acting is beyond belief.  Watching people getting back up from blows that would have shattered bones was silly, although this seems to be a major theme in modern action movies. The Japanese were stereotyped and some did not appear to be Japanese at all.But, anyone who has not seen a Bruce Lee film should do so, just so they know what other folks are talking about.  Viewing this DVD was in fact an educational experience.  I am not sure if it was a good or bad one, but it was educational.  But, I think that was enough and my lust to view more of Lee's work may have been satisfied forever...except for ""The Green Hornet"" television series, which is also silly in it's own way.",3,Outch!!,1299715200,"03 10, 2011",2011,1045,"['watched', 'video', 'viewing', 'History', 'channel', 'program', 'legend', 'Bruce', 'Lee.The', 'theme', 'song', 'faint', 'watered', 'echo', '007', 'soundtrack', 'stripper', 'was', 'fat', 'dubbed', 'voices', 'were', 'something', 'else', 'who', 'wrote', 'dialogue', 'ending', 'extraordinarily', 'similar', 'Butch', 'Cassidy', 'Sundance', 'Kid', 'filmed', 'two', 'years', 'previously', 'acting', 'belief', 'Watching', 'people', 'getting', 'back', 'blows', 'would', 'have', 'shattered', 'bones', 'was', 'silly', 'be', 'major', 'theme', 'modern', 'action', 'movies', 'Japanese', 'were', 'stereotyped', 'did', 'not', 'appear', 'be', 'Japanese', 'all.But', 'anyone', 'who', 'not', 'seen', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'film', 'should', 'do', 'so', 'just', 'know', 'what', 'other', 'folks', 'are', 'talking', 'Viewing', 'DVD', 'was', 'fact', 'educational', 'experience', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'good', 'bad', 'one', 'was', 'educational', 'think', 'was', 'enough', 'lust', 'view', 'more', 'Lee', 'work', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'satisfied', 'forever', 'Green', 'Hornet', 'television', 'series', 'also', 'silly', 'own', 'way']",N/A

229113,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,6300250156,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[2, 2]","I'm by no means a martial arts enthusiast, and I know almost nothing about Asian cinema, but there is just nothing better than a Bruce Lee movie.  Fists of Fury marks the point in which Bruce finally sheds the silly mask of the Green Hornet's sidekick Kato and becomes a full-fledged star in his own right.  Certainly, Fists of Fury is not Bruce's best film, and I don't believe he even choreographed the fight scenes himself, but to me this is a vastly underrated film.The film opens with Cheng Chao-an (Bruce Lee) arriving wherever it is this story takes place to live and work alongside some of his cousins.  His uncle as well as the locket he wears around his neck are constant reminders of the pledge he made to his mother that he would never fight anyone again.  I have to tell you, it's pretty hard not to fight in this environment.  Before he even gets to his new home, he has to watch a gang of thugs intimidate a poor young lady and kick a little kid around.  He holds himself back, but his cousin does not; he takes on all comers and walks away smiling.  Cheng's new life is turbulent from the start; the foreman at the ice shipping factory where all the men work is a brute of a man, some guy gives him a knuckle sandwich for no good reason on his first day, and the business itself turns out to be beyond crooked, but the real problem is even more insidious.  Cheng's friends and relatives slowly begin disappearing, usually after having a talk with the manager or the nebulous Big Boss.  When the men revolt and start an all-out fight at the plant, Cheng hangs back- until, that is, someone cuts him.  This marks the first appearance of the Bruce Lee so many of us know and love; the look in Cheng's eyes right after he is slashed foretells the imminent demise of his oath of peace, and the fight ends rather quickly once he joins the fray.  He wanders off the path somewhat after this, taken in by a promotion and the frills that come his way as a result, but his destiny is to face the dope-smuggling, preternaturally cruel Big Boss mano a mano.Bruce Lee's acting talents are easily apparent in this first of his feature films.  Starting as a country bumpkin of sorts, Cheng's shyness and feelings for the lovely lass Chow Mei (Maria Yi) are expressed both subtly and convincingly.  His face also bears clearly the inner turmoil he feels early on as his oath keeps him from joining a fight that is morally justified.  His expressions when the decision to fight is basically made for him are priceless, but he really comes into his own during the fight scenes.  No one will ever come close to matching Lee's fighting performances, and while the fights in Fists of Fury aren't as elaborate as those of later films, they are plenty impressive to me.  Who else but Bruce Lee could take on the ultimate bad guy and his minions while purposefully eating a bag of crackers?Fists of Fury is a dark film; let there be no mistake about that.  You won't come away from this movie feeling happy or light of heart.  It has a pretty high body count, and while none of the deaths are shown in gruesome detail, there can be little doubt about the levels of blood and pain that surely coincide with a good many final breaths.  Evil and cruelty run rampant on the streets, and even the brotherhood of the good guys is greatly diminished at one critical juncture of the story.  I doubt that the American public had ever really seen a movie such as this Hong Kong production back in 1971, but two things are certain: Fists of Fury played a very important part in making Bruce Lee the super-human legend he is and always will be, and it also helped make martial arts films a hearty new staple to be enjoyed by untold numbers of people across America and much of the rest of the non-Asian world.",5,Bruce takes care of business in his first starring role,1064966400,"10 1, 2003",2003,3789,"[""'m"", 'martial', 'arts', 'enthusiast', 'know', 'almost', 'nothing', 'Asian', 'cinema', 'just', 'nothing', 'better', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'movie', 'Fists', 'Fury', 'point', 'Bruce', 'finally', 'silly', 'mask', 'Green', 'Hornet', 'sidekick', 'Kato', 'full-fledged', 'star', 'own', 'right', 'Certainly', 'Fists', 'Fury', 'not', 'Bruce', 'best', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'even', 'choreographed', 'fight', 'vastly', 'underrated', 'film.The', 'film', 'Cheng', 'Chao-an', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'arriving', 'wherever', 'story', 'place', 'live', 'work', 'alongside', 'cousins', 'uncle', 'as', 'well', 'locket', 'neck', 'are', 'constant', 'reminders', 'pledge', 'made', 'mother', 'would', 'never', 'fight', 'anyone', 'again', 'have', 'tell', 'pretty', 'hard', 'not', 'fight', 'environment', 'even', 'new', 'home', 'watch', 'gang', 'thugs', 'intimidate', 'poor', 'young', 'lady', 'kick', 'little', 'kid', 'around', 'back', 'cousin', 'not', 'comers', 'walks', 'away', 'smiling', 'Cheng', 'new', 'life', 'turbulent', 'start', 'foreman', 'ice', 'shipping', 'factory', 'where', 'men', 'work', 'brute', 'man', 'guy', 'knuckle', 'sandwich', 'good', 'reason', 'first', 'day', 'business', 'out', 'be', 'crooked', 'real', 'problem', 'even', 'more', 'insidious', 'Cheng', 'friends', 'relatives', 'slowly', 'begin', 'disappearing', 'usually', 'having', 'talk', 'manager', 'nebulous', 'Big', 'Boss', 'When', 'men', 'revolt', 'start', 'all-out', 'fight', 'plant', 'Cheng', 'back-', 'someone', 'cuts', 'first', 'appearance', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'so', 'many', 'know', 'love', 'look', 'Cheng', 'eyes', 'right', 'slashed', 'foretells', 'imminent', 'demise', 'oath', 'peace', 'fight', 'rather', 'quickly', 'fray', 'path', 'somewhat', 'taken', 'promotion', 'frills', 'come', 'way', 'result', 'destiny', 'face', 'dope-smuggling', 'preternaturally', 'cruel', 'Big', 'Boss', 'mano.Bruce', 'Lee', 'acting', 'talents', 'are', 'easily', 'apparent', 'first', 'feature', 'films', 'Starting', 'country', 'bumpkin', 'sorts', 'Cheng', 'shyness', 'feelings', 'lovely', 'lass', 'Chow', 'Mei', 'Maria', 'Yi', 'are', 'expressed', 'subtly', 'convincingly', 'face', 'also', 'clearly', 'inner', 'turmoil', 'early', 'oath', 'joining', 'fight', 'morally', 'justified', 'expressions', 'when', 'decision', 'fight', 'basically', 'made', 'are', 'priceless', 'really', 'own', 'fight', 'scenes', 'one', 'will', 'ever', 'come', 'close', 'matching', 'Lee', 'fighting', 'performances', 'fights', 'Fists', 'Fury', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'elaborate', 'later', 'films', 'are', 'plenty', 'impressive', 'Who', 'else', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'could', 'take', 'ultimate', 'bad', 'guy', 'minions', 'purposefully', 'eating', 'bag', 'crackers', 'Fists', 'Fury', 'dark', 'film', 'let', 'be', 'mistake', 'wo', ""n't"", 'come', 'away', 'movie', 'feeling', 'happy', 'light', 'heart', 'pretty', 'high', 'body', 'count', 'none', 'deaths', 'are', 'shown', 'gruesome', 'detail', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'doubt', 'levels', 'blood', 'pain', 'surely', 'coincide', 'good', 'many', 'final', 'breaths', 'Evil', 'cruelty', 'run', 'rampant', 'streets', 'even', 'brotherhood', 'good', 'guys', 'greatly', 'diminished', 'one', 'critical', 'juncture', 'story', 'doubt', 'American', 'public', 'had', 'ever', 'really', 'seen', 'movie', 'such', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'production', 'back', '1971', 'two', 'things', 'are', 'certain', 'Fists', 'Fury', 'played', 'very', 'important', 'part', 'making', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'super-human', 'legend', 'always', 'will', 'be', 'also', 'helped', 'make', 'martial', 'arts', 'films', 'hearty', 'new', 'staple', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'untold', 'numbers', 'people', 'America', 'much', 'rest', 'non-Asian', 'world']",N/A

229117,A1TKYAYESYHIA2,6300250156,"Elijah Chingosho ""Dr Elijah Chingosho""","[0, 0]","""Fist of Fury"" is a good movie. This is Bruce Lee (starring as Cheng Chao-an) first debut as a fully fledged martial arts star. This is not his best film but it helped to propel him into the super-hero and legend status that he is today and will ever be. He also popularized martial arts worldwide.The movie is a bit slow at the beginning when Bruce Lee moves from his town to run away from fights and other problems and goes to a small town to live with his cousins. He promises his mother that he will never fight, which is a hard promise to keep in the environment he is living. For example, on his way to his new home, he witnesses a young lady and a kid being harassed and bullied but does not take an active part in the ensuing fight.Cheng gets a job at a local ice factory. Cheng finds out that the factory is just a front for making drugs. His friends start disappearing mysteriously without trace. The pace of the film picks up when Cheng and his colleagues start investigations into the disappearance of their friends. Fighting erupts and Cheng demonstrates his exceptional martial arts skills.Among my most memorable scenes includes when Bruce Lee fights the gangsters in the ice factory after someone cuts him and he joins the fight. When he starts to participate in the fight, the end is brief as the gangsters cannot match his outstanding performance. Also the grand finale is when Bruce Lee takes the fight to the Big Boss. The viewer is treated to some remarkable and breathtaking display of martial arts fighting in an open courtyard. Cheng has to fight some fierce dogs and ruthless gangsters and finally the Big Boss himself.This is a good movie that is well worth watching.",4,The Making of a Legend,1146873600,"05 6, 2006",2006,1693,"['Fist', 'Fury', 'good', 'movie', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'starring', 'Cheng', 'Chao-an', 'first', 'debut', 'fully', 'fledged', 'martial', 'arts', 'star', 'not', 'best', 'film', 'helped', 'propel', 'super-hero', 'legend', 'status', 'today', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'also', 'popularized', 'martial', 'arts', 'worldwide.The', 'movie', 'bit', 'slow', 'beginning', 'when', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'town', 'run', 'away', 'fights', 'other', 'problems', 'small', 'town', 'live', 'cousins', 'mother', 'will', 'never', 'fight', 'hard', 'promise', 'keep', 'environment', 'living', 'example', 'way', 'new', 'home', 'young', 'lady', 'kid', 'being', 'harassed', 'bullied', 'not', 'take', 'active', 'part', 'ensuing', 'fight.Cheng', 'job', 'local', 'ice', 'factory', 'Cheng', 'out', 'factory', 'just', 'front', 'making', 'drugs', 'friends', 'start', 'disappearing', 'mysteriously', 'trace', 'pace', 'film', 'up', 'when', 'Cheng', 'colleagues', 'start', 'investigations', 'disappearance', 'friends', 'Fighting', 'erupts', 'Cheng', 'exceptional', 'martial', 'arts', 'skills.Among', 'most', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'when', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'gangsters', 'ice', 'factory', 'someone', 'cuts', 'fight', 'When', 'participate', 'fight', 'end', 'brief', 'gangsters', 'can', 'not', 'match', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'Also', 'grand', 'finale', 'when', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'fight', 'Big', 'Boss', 'viewer', 'treated', 'remarkable', 'breathtaking', 'display', 'martial', 'arts', 'fighting', 'open', 'courtyard', 'Cheng', 'fight', 'fierce', 'dogs', 'ruthless', 'gangsters', 'finally', 'Big', 'Boss', 'himself.This', 'good', 'movie', 'well', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A
229118,AKZMP6OOE89GV,6300250156,Elite14,"[0, 0]","Fists Of Fury represents Bruce Lee's introduction into the martial arts movie genre. After getting shunned by Hollywood, he went back to Hong Kong and teamed with Raymond Chow (a movie producer). This first film in the Bruce Lee collection is much more raw and low budget than the others. It's also quite cheesy watching it 23 years later. But it has Bruce Lee in it. And he kicks ass. What else do you need to know?The story goes that Bruce comes to a small town that some of his cousins live in. He moved there to escape the fights and problems he was having in his old town. Of course, he will find some trouble in his new surroundings soon enough. He spends the first half of the movie NOT fighting, due to a promise he once made his mother. He gets a job at a Thailand ice factory. He and his mates find that it is a front for a drug smuggling operation. Once his friends start disappearing, he investigates. And that is where the movie really kicks in.I must admit, the movie is quite low budget and cheesy. Once Bruce starts beating everyone in sight, however, it gets really good. The acting is terrible. The dialogue is even worse. You will also notice some Hong Kong movie staples that could never happen in real life. Like the bad guy lightly tossing a birdcage up in the air and it hooking itself on to a tree branch. Then Bruce chucks a knife up and hits the cage, it falls and breaks and the birds escape. When you see this, it will make you wonder how the hell this cheesy movie made money. Then when Bruce's fists and feet start flying, you will know. This film is built around Bruce and Bruce alone. If you can get past the fact that it's quite dated looking, poorly acted, and has a terrible script, you will enjoy it. Kick back and watch Bruce in his first role that would make him a god in many people's eyes for years to come.The DVD has no extras whatsoever.

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","Not having parlayed his Green Hornet television stint to stardom in the U.S. and stuck in the purgatory of making cameos in Hollywood, Bruce Lee deployed to Hong Kong cinema to try his luck there. 1971's The Big Boss (a.k.a. Fists of Fury) shattered Hong Kong's box offices, the highest grossing film in Hong Kong's history until it was supplanted by Lee's next major release, The Chinese Connection. The Big Boss elevated Bruce to international superstar status and made Golden Harvest head producer Raymond Chow have an oopsie in his pants (but in a good way).We don't get to know the specifics of why Cheng Chao-an (Lee) had to relocate to Thailand. We strongly suspect it was for inordinate street brawling. In Thailand he moves in with his cousins - including the lovely Chow Mei (Maria Yi) - and lands a job at the ice factory in the southside of town. In Thailand Cheng aims to start fresh, aims to uphold his vow to his mother to keep out of trouble. But Cheng may have to let his mother down when the sadistic foreman just won't let up, and then laborers at the ice factory start to mysteriously vanish, and then his lovely cousin is jeopardized.The Big Boss is such seminal work, and yet it speaks to how even more iconic his other films are that this one is possibly the least famous in his starring feature films. The Big Boss reset the paradigm with its more realistic approach to martial arts filmmaking. More tellingly, Bruce Lee's undiluted charisma was unleashed to the world, and the world said, ""Whoa!"" Bruce stalks the screen like a coiled tiger, and right away you register the big swagger. But The Big Boss slow burns you to death. The plot unfolds as an extended tease up until the third act. Throughout, Cheng Chao-an's pacifist resolve is severely tested. But whenever you think he's had enough and is about to bust out a can on someone, he instead resorts to a lot of fingering his mom's locket circling his neck. Give Cheng his due, he tried like the dickens to keep that promise.We learn quickly enough that the ice factory is a front for the local drug cartel, and that the blocks of ice serve as a drug delivery system. Maybe I'm wrong but I swear I read somewhere that The Big Boss was originally intended as a vehicle for co-star James Tien - who plays Bruce's noble cousin Hsu Chien - until studio heads realized what they had in Bruce and went all in on him. Sure enough, early on, it's James Tien who comes off as the protagonist. His Hsu Chien is the one succoring the weak and the bullied. He's the one serving up the thrashings. But when Bruce - in one of those classic delayed gratifications for the audience - at last springs into action, he leaves James Tien, action hero, in the dust. Even for those who'd seen him in Green Hornet (or, as it's billed in Hong Kong, ""The Kato Show""), it must've been an eye-opening revelation to eyeball Bruce Lee in motion. The Big Boss captures the unparalleled grace, the fluidity, the whiplike quickness, and that trademark intensity. There's that peerless show of bravado and that sense of style in how he takes out waves of goons, whether it's a no-look knife toss to take out a baddie sneaking up or punching a henchman so hard he crashes thru a wall and leaves behind a henchman-shaped hole on that wall. Note that Bruce isn't averse to grabbing onto and twisting one's junk to end a fight.But even when he's not making a thug reevaluate his career as a bruiser, even though he's given minimal dialogue, Lee still has a presence about him. Even when in repose, when he's just sitting or standing there, your eye's drawn to him. He's a likeable leading man, and I like that he doesn't mind occasionally acting goofy (like his boozy time at the brothel or when he and his cousins celebrate an unexpected promotion).I won't fib, I prefer Enter the Dragon, Way of the Dragon, and The Chinese Connection over The Big Boss. And Bruce's ever escalating duels at the pagoda in Game of Death are easily trump the brand of violence presented in The Big Boss. But even the least interesting of Bruce's scraps in The Big Boss craps on those staged by this film's comtemporaries. Bruce Lee is just that dynamic. So if you're curious about the film that broke him out as an overnight motion picture sensation... if you're down with some groovy 1970's theme music... and you don't mind a few seconds of nudity (remember: brothel)... then catch this movie and see how Bruce Lee forever changed the identity of martial arts and made martial arts accessible to western audiences. From then on, I guess Britt Reid had to do his own driving.",4,"""Cheng! Don't just stand there!

Some English dubbed versions are known as Fists of Fury. The bad English dubbing is amusing and it uses stock music from Peter Thomas LP's. The film was re-released in 1981 with an original music score. Lee struggled to get good parts in Hollywood movies and TV shows. Golden Harvest president in Hong Kong Raymond Chow gave Bruce Lee the green light to make an action movie in Thailand with a budget of $100,000. Lo Wei was hired to direct the film. Lee played Cheng Chiu An, a Chinese guy who moves to Thailand to get a job. When his ""friends and family"" vanish, he conducts an investigation and stumbles upon a shocking secret. It's ironic that the main bad guy is also Chinese. There's many scenes from this film that are lost forever. There's a scene where Cheng sleeps with a prostitute. There's another scene where Cheng graphically splits a man's head open with a saw! The censors snipped out this footage after 1971. Maria Yi is quite good as a Chinese girl who has a crush on Cheng. The Big Boss is a low budget grindhouse movie with good editing by Ming Sun. Early 1970's movies had a hard edge. This could explain why The Godfather(1972) and The French Connection(1971) were big hits. Chinese comedian Li Kun is in the film. Guess Who Killed My 12 Lovers(1968) probably gave him more screen time for his brand of comedy. In the 1960's, Bruce Lee was friends with some of Hollywood's A list talent.

FOF is the early Bruce Lee, still trying to establish his own screen persona. His learning curve stretched for several more years.  What becomes evident is a movie that has all the hallmarks of Hong Kong kung fu flicks: simpering Chinese girls in pigtails who cry in every other scene; the Oriental equivalent of the 'comic darkey' who tries pathetically hard to tell jokes; some truly atrocious plotting, scripting, dubbing, directing; villains who laugh as they do evil and twirl their mustaches in a manner that brings to mind Snidely Whiplash; and then there are the fight scenes.  For most of the first half, Bruce Lee does not fight at all.  Bound by a promise to an uncle who seems cosmically ignorant, Lee allows others to fight for him.  After a while, the audience begins to pay less attention to the minimal plot and more to wondering when Lee will do more than just watch others battle.Lee begins the movie as Cheng, who gets a job working in an ice factory run by drug dealers who hide their drugs and victims in rolling blocks of ice.  He promises not to fight and the only suspense that the film generates is when he will break his promise.  Well into the second half, he discovers the true nature of the ice factory and then follows two scenes of martial arts worth noting.  The first occurs in the ice factory when he confronts and disposes of an entire platoon of pathetic opposition.  One of the problems I saw in this fight was the incredible stupidity of the bad guys.  They outnumber Lee.  They surround Lee.  But they attack him only one at a time while the others bounce up and down making ridiculous kata movements. If they had jumped him en masse Lee would have surely gone down.  The second fight scene was the climactic one-on-one encounter between Lee and the Evil Boss (no not Vince McMahon).  This fight is one of those drawn out exhibitions whose phoniness only manages to expose the lack of fighting ability of the Evil Boss. Since it was so easy for Lee to wipe the floor with the Boss's lackeys, why then does it take so long to take out their boss?  The answer to this conumdrum does not become evident until several Lee movies later when Bruce Lee recognizes that for him to look good, he needs a worthy opponent. He did not find one in FOF, a movie that will be of interest only to those who are fanatical about seeing every movie he was in.

229134,AE8YLQ8P45GR,6300250156,M.C,"[2, 4]","I ask you once again, Is Bruce Lee's first starring role in THE BIG BOSS (titled FISTS OF FURY for it's U.S. audience) suuposed to be this,ph Ha Ha Ha, Hil- Ha Ha Ha- Hilarious? I really don't know. This has got to be one of the cheesiest hong kong films ever, but with good old Bruce Lee around, who cares?The fighting is cool when Bruce Lee bursts with FURY, breaking a sacred promise to his mother to avoid fights. Most of the acting is fairly mediocre, with Bruce as an exception, of course. Boy, when he starts kickin', it's awesome, and even when he's just got that look in his eye, that he knows that he's in control of the fight and no matter how badly they beat him, he will always rise to the occasion and kick some [booty].Bruce not only displays his martial arts skills, the finesse of his ossified physique, and his abilty to act, he even shows a few of his legendary punchlines, things like cracking his knuckles simply by making a FIST, or licking the blood off and open wound and screaming before retaliating.Of course, Bruce was a pretty good actor, but even he couldn't always deal with dialouge as bad as this. The movies most memorable line was ""They stole my rice cakes and kicked me."" and wasn't even throw out there by Bruce. Nope, they left and innocent child with that responsibilty. Here's another pseudo semi-descent quote from the movie:""Why hasn't my son come back. Go to the factory and see if you can locate him.""Bruce got all the best lines, and all of those are evidence that the writers just went through the motions for the dialouge. Didn't they know that the hero in any action film should have something clever to say. Nope, they gave Bruce childish dialouge.Of course, that's 5 times what can be said for the dubbing. Everytime a punch or kick is throw in the movie, it somehow sounds like someone's blowing with great force into a microphone. And the cinematography is on par with your average camcorder. The martial arts scenes are terrifc, nonetheless. Bruce just had that ability to take any bad film, toss in his patented Jeet Kune Do, and voila! We have an enjoyable movie.Bottom line, to Bruce Lee fans(of whom there are many)and non-fans (of whom there are very few) alike. Watch this film.

229139,A1D2Z6UOCT9456,6300250156,"P. Ferrigno ""firehouse444""","[26, 27]","Back in 1970, Bruce Lee was a keen martial artist with three Jeet Kune Do studios, he had a fledgling TV/movie career in the United States appearing in movies such as ""Marlowe"" and TV series such as ""Longstreet"", and he was charging major Hollywood stars up to $250 an hour for personal martial arts tuition. However, Bruce Lee was somewhat unsatisfied with his life, and he had headed back to Hong Kong for a break and arrived to an unexpected welcome from many young Chinese TV fans, who had seen him as ""Kato"" on the cult TV series ""The Green Hornet"". Also around this time, HK film producer Raymond Chow had left Run Run Shaw and started ""Golden Harvest"" productions, and spied the athletic Bruce as a potential lead actor for the action film genre. After some negotiations, Chow managed to secure Bruce's signature to star in a low budget martial arts film titled ""Tang shan da xiong"", or as it was eventually released in Western film markets, ""The Big Boss"" aka ""Fists of Fury"".Filming was completed around Pak Chang in Thailand, and by all reports it wasn't the most pleasant of places, and the cast and crew survived on terrible meals and poor accomodation. The plot line is simple enough....a young Bruce Lee plays Cheng Chao-an, who has come to the big city to work with his cousins in the local ice factory. His father's departing words of wisdom to Bruce are to remember his promise not to get into any fights, and as a reminder Bruce wears a jade pendant around his neck. However, trouble seems to follow Cheng around and before long he is drawn into violence, as the truth is uncovered that the ice factory is merely a front for a heroin smuggling operation. ""The Big Boss"" aka ""Fists of Fury"" certainly has it's shortcomings, however in 1971 it was the springboard that really launched the legend of Bruce Lee, and it remains forever a key film in the evolution of the martial arts / action genre. Lee was a capable enough actor to demonstrate a broad range of emotion and feelings beyond just anger.....he's an eager and willing worker for his first day at the ice factory, he's wooden and uncomfortable when he first meets his city cousins, and he's clumsy and embarassed around the pretty Nora Maio. However, Lee was at his most charismatic and thrilling to film audiences when he explodes against the villains who butcher his friends, and the film's fight sequences featuring Lee are violent, uncompromising and fast paced. Lee could also capably mix in humour with his brooding menace, such as in the scene when Bruce is munching on a bag of chips, he kicks two knife wielding thugs in the groin, and then continues to finish his chips ! As the body count escalates, the film moves towards a showdown between Bruce Lee and the sinister owner of the ice factory (played by the wonderful Yin-Chieh Han, who also appeared as a trecherous cook in Lee's next film ""Fist of Fury"" )The film received a rapturous welcome from Chinese film fans, who just loved watching this rugged & handsome Chinese actor and his flailing fists, and the movie broke many box office records in Hong Kong.Now to which version on DVD you should buy ! The DVD version of this film on Amazon.com with the red tinted cover is the Region 1 CBS/FOX release, and it's not true widescreen, it's only the dubbed English version, and only presented in Dolby Digital 2.0 mono.However, my suggestion is that you log onto the Amazon UK website and buy yourself the Hong Kong Legends Special Collectors Edition DVD of ""The Big Boss"", as it is the finest quality presentation available of this movie on DVD. The special release DVD's long list of goodies includes the following : a digitally remastered crystal clear and UNCUT 16:9 Anamorphic widescreen presentation, plus the soundtrack is selectable between the dubbed English version, or the original Cantonese version both in Dolby Digital 5.1 Audio ! On top of that there is a sensational audio commentary track from film commentator / Bruce Lee fanatic Bey Logan, plus original theatrical trailers and interviews with cast members. The disc is Region 2, but hey that's why they invented multi-region DVD players. I've owned many versions of this film on DVD from all over the world, however hands down the HK Legends DVD is the best one yet and it rates 5 stars and more.

Seen today, the martial artist's breakthrough performance compensates for a limited budget and director Lo Wei's slow pacing. Lee plays a young man who has promised his uncle not to fight - however, when friends and relatives are murdered by heroin smugglers, he finds the promise difficult to keep. The movie slightly disappoints because Lee doesn't take charge until the final half-hour, with some fight sequences marred by trick photography.

The movie is brutal, and Lee is  actually an excellent actor, what an amazing face, and what amazing  expression.  Of course the dialogue and stuff sound a little corny because  of the translation, but when he gets back to the ice factory later, and  he's not just trying to beat people up anymore, but rather leaving people  killed with their mouths open, WHAT?  Plus there's nudity!  (okay, that's  not what gives it points, but it doesn't detract).  Furthermore, its got a  funky soundtrack.  The Chinese, unlike Americans, don't need happy endings,  and this is one of the most sublime, not just going down in a blaze, he is  the hero, but it's futile.  Don't sleep on this movie, its amazing.

How can you give anything less to the man that perpetuated all the kung fu movies, after him ? You can't . I certainly wouldn't. There'll never be another like him. The film , itself is flawless ... kicking. It's got the famous ice factory scene, the yard scenes , and Jackie Chan performing the longest fall in kung fu history on film , at that time. This film is very significant. But this rating , I give to the dvd ""cheap"" version. Check this out : I have all of his movies on vhs , as well. However , I've recently converted to dvd's. With that in mind , I wanted to purchase all of Lee's movies on dvd. Fists of Fury is one of Bruce Lee's finest movies and I appreciate it's importance to the kung fu genre. However , I figured I'd save a few bucks and get the version that costs less than , say , an official version ( with an actual picture of Bruce on the cover , instead of a cartoon or painting). In  my cheap version , it is intirely in fullscreen. So much , in fact , that parts of the film run off of the screen. It was painful to watch. From that point , I ordered the normal versions of his other movies , and found the format phenominally different and I could start watching the Bruce Lee films , the way that he would want any of his fans to. Just stay away from the cheap versions and stick to the official studio ones.
