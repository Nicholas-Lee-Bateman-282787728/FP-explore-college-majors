692870,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0000633SD,Andrew Ellington,"[4, 4]","I've always been, and probably (hopefully) will always be an emotional person.  Lately (in light of some major personal revelations) I've been an even bigger emotional wreck than usual, so it's no surprise that I bawled like a baby during the final `flower' scene in `Letyat Zhuravli'.  While the ending scene's manipulative sentiment may tug at every person's heartstrings (it better), the film as a whole is far from a clich&eacute;d emotional melodrama.  `Letyat Zhuravli' is a tender, honest and beautifully tragic tribute to love, war and love during war.The film centers around a young and impressionable woman named Veronika.  Smitten with her fianc&eacute; (maybe not officially, but they cannot deny the inevitable) Boris, Veronika can't stop imagining the eternal love they will share as a family.  What she is unaware of though is that Boris has volunteered to fight in the war, a war that will tear her dreams to shreds.  With Boris missing in action and presumed dead Veronika feels almost forced into a marriage to Boris's draft-dodging cousin Mark, who has been pawning over Veronika even before Boris's departure.  Despite the cold shoulder by some in Boris's family, Veronika presses forward, holding firm to the belief that her love will eventually return to her.But will he?I want to just say right now that Tatyana Samojlova is a revelation here as the wilted Veronika.  Her handling of this lost soul is astounding.  She easily maneuvers her character through harrowing sequences of pure loneliness and isolation and then into enraged hysterics that never once feel forced or overtly dramatized.  She gives a natural and moving performance, breathing a life into this all too familiar woman.  I also want to single out Vasili Merkuryev, who plays Fyodor, Boris's father.  His strong and grounded paternal performance is a beautifully controlled example of unwavering love, even in the face of trials to once faith.  That final scene, the one that just kills me, is made all the more heartwarming (and breaking) by his presence.This film carries with it a strong political statement, yet like powerful films such as `Dead Man Walking', `Scener ur ett Aktenskap' and `4 Luni, 3 Saptamani si 2 Zile', `Letyat Zhuravli' refuses to gives us an easy answer to the questions posed.  War is a touchy subject, for there is rarely a middle ground.  You are either a supporter or not.  I personally (watch this get me a slew of negative votes) find the idea of war repulsive and do not support it in any way, shape or form.  That doesn't stop me from appreciating the stance that this beautiful film encourages us to take.  We see both sides of the spectrum and are left with the ability to either take a side or just ponder the ambiguities, which for me is the more richly rewarding course.  With strong talk of heroics (which is a needed attribute to completely adore the film) yet ample examples of the obvious downside, `Letyat Zhuravli' gives us an honest portrayal of war.It is just up to each and every viewer to decide how he or she perceives this film's purpose.",5,A stunning film that really exposes war with blatant honesty...,1258329600,"11 16, 2009",2009,3081,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'probably', 'hopefully', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'emotional', 'person', 'Lately', 'light', 'major', 'personal', 'revelations', ""'ve"", 'been', 'even', 'bigger', 'emotional', 'wreck', 'usual', 'surprise', 'bawled', 'baby', 'final', 'flower', 'scene', 'Letyat', 'Zhuravli', 'ending', 'scene', 'manipulative', 'sentiment', 'may', 'tug', 'person', 'heartstrings', 'better', 'film', 'whole', 'far', 'clich', 'eacute', 'emotional', 'melodrama', 'Letyat', 'Zhuravli', 'tender', 'honest', 'beautifully', 'tragic', 'tribute', 'love', 'war', 'love', 'war.The', 'film', 'centers', 'young', 'impressionable', 'woman', 'named', 'Veronika', 'Smitten', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'maybe', 'not', 'officially', 'can', 'not', 'deny', 'inevitable', 'Boris', 'Veronika', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'imagining', 'eternal', 'love', 'will', 'share', 'family', 'What', 'unaware', 'though', 'Boris', 'volunteered', 'fight', 'war', 'war', 'will', 'tear', 'dreams', 'shreds', 'Boris', 'missing', 'action', 'presumed', 'dead', 'Veronika', 'feels', 'almost', 'forced', 'marriage', 'Boris', 'draft-dodging', 'cousin', 'Mark', 'who', 'been', 'pawning', 'Veronika', 'even', 'Boris', 'departure', 'cold', 'shoulder', 'Boris', 'family', 'Veronika', 'forward', 'holding', 'firm', 'belief', 'love', 'will', 'eventually', 'return', 'her.But', 'will', 'want', 'just', 'say', 'right', 'now', 'Tatyana', 'Samojlova', 'revelation', 'here', 'wilted', 'Veronika', 'handling', 'lost', 'soul', 'astounding', 'easily', 'character', 'harrowing', 'sequences', 'pure', 'loneliness', 'isolation', 'then', 'enraged', 'hysterics', 'never', 'once', 'feel', 'forced', 'overtly', 'dramatized', 'natural', 'moving', 'performance', 'breathing', 'life', 'too', 'familiar', 'woman', 'also', 'want', 'single', 'out', 'Vasili', 'Merkuryev', 'who', 'Fyodor', 'Boris', 'father', 'strong', 'grounded', 'paternal', 'performance', 'beautifully', 'controlled', 'example', 'unwavering', 'love', 'even', 'face', 'trials', 'once', 'faith', 'final', 'scene', 'one', 'just', 'kills', 'made', 'more', 'heartwarming', 'breaking', 'presence.This', 'film', 'strong', 'political', 'statement', 'yet', 'powerful', 'films', 'such', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Walking', 'Scener', 'ur', 'ett', 'Aktenskap', '4', 'Luni', '3', 'Saptamani', 'si', '2', 'Zile', 'Letyat', 'Zhuravli', 'refuses', 'easy', 'answer', 'questions', 'posed', 'War', 'touchy', 'subject', 'rarely', 'middle', 'ground', 'are', 'either', 'supporter', 'not', 'personally', 'watch', 'get', 'slew', 'negative', 'votes', 'find', 'idea', 'war', 'repulsive', 'do', 'not', 'support', 'way', 'shape', 'form', ""n't"", 'stop', 'appreciating', 'stance', 'beautiful', 'film', 'take', 'see', 'sides', 'spectrum', 'are', 'left', 'ability', 'take', 'side', 'just', 'ponder', 'ambiguities', 'more', 'richly', 'rewarding', 'course', 'strong', 'talk', 'heroics', 'needed', 'attribute', 'completely', 'adore', 'film', 'yet', 'ample', 'examples', 'obvious', 'downside', 'Letyat', 'Zhuravli', 'honest', 'portrayal', 'war.It', 'just', 'up', 'viewer', 'decide', 'how', 'film', 'purpose']",N/A
692871,A1PASRZ81DY9C,B0000633SD,Austin Somlo,"[1, 1]","Viewed: 1/08Rate: 71/08: The Cranes Are Flying, for me, is a mixed bag of opinions. On a technical standpoint, it's brilliantly shot at times. Moreover, the technique is absolutely raw and uninhibited. Of course, it's not often that I see this nowadays, or in the past films, for that matter. On the other hand, the story is a bit confusing, and at times, The Cranes Are Flying is tediously slow. Once the picture gets picked up and rolling, The Cranes Are Flying starts to become alive and then slows down. Pretty much of the time, it's best to say that The Cranes Are Flying is an intermittent type of a picture. Still, the film is more of a required-repeated-viewing than just a one-timer. The acting is not bad at all, and the beautiful Tatyana Samojlova steals the show in every scene. One letdown from The Cranes Are Flying is the weak chemistry between her character and Boris. That probably undermines the film as whole, but the ending, the way how it is done, may have erased the negativity. It is also possible that the lack of originality in the story renders The Cranes Are Flying mundane, but again, how the film is shot rises itself out of that position. All in all, The Cranes Are Flying requires another watch from me but remains highly recommended for its technical viewpoint in terms of camera work.",4,Technically Beautiful But Lacking in Other Areas.,1290902400,"11 28, 2010",2010,1317,"['Viewed', '1/08Rate', '71/08', 'Cranes', 'Are', 'Flying', 'mixed', 'bag', 'opinions', 'technical', 'standpoint', 'brilliantly', 'shot', 'times', 'Moreover', 'technique', 'absolutely', 'raw', 'uninhibited', 'course', 'not', 'often', 'see', 'nowadays', 'past', 'films', 'matter', 'other', 'hand', 'story', 'bit', 'confusing', 'times', 'Cranes', 'Are', 'Flying', 'tediously', 'slow', 'picture', 'picked', 'up', 'rolling', 'Cranes', 'Are', 'Flying', 'starts', 'become', 'alive', 'then', 'down', 'Pretty', 'much', 'time', 'best', 'say', 'Cranes', 'Are', 'Flying', 'intermittent', 'type', 'picture', 'Still', 'film', 'more', 'required-repeated-viewing', 'just', 'one-timer', 'acting', 'not', 'bad', 'beautiful', 'Tatyana', 'Samojlova', 'show', 'scene', 'One', 'letdown', 'Cranes', 'Are', 'Flying', 'weak', 'chemistry', 'character', 'Boris', 'probably', 'film', 'whole', 'ending', 'way', 'how', 'done', 'may', 'have', 'erased', 'negativity', 'also', 'possible', 'lack', 'originality', 'story', 'Cranes', 'Are', 'Flying', 'mundane', 'again', 'how', 'film', 'shot', 'rises', 'position', 'Cranes', 'Are', 'Flying', 'watch', 'highly', 'recommended', 'technical', 'viewpoint', 'terms', 'camera', 'work']",N/A

But those shots were tied to sketchy, overlong, shrill vignettes, whereas this 1957 film is an enjoyable, old-fashioned melodrama. The lead, Tatyana Samojlova, is very appealing; she's fresh-faced and sexy and very moving when she needs to be. The most famous shot when she races to bid farewell to her lover headed off to war: it starts hand-held on a bus, leaves the bus to track laterally through a crowd, and then goes up, up, up on a crane to catch view the whole street. Wonderful montage sequences when she's raped by her lover's cousin during an air-raid, when she has a panic attack and almost kills herself, and when her lover is wounded in battle and imagines a wedding that is not to be. 8/10",4,The Cranes Are Flying,1320364800,"11 4, 2011",2011,813,"['so', 'many', 'people', 'was', 'astounded', 'tracking/hand-held/crane', 'shots', 'Mikhail', 'Kalatozov', 'AM', 'CUBA', 'shots', 'were', 'tied', 'sketchy', 'overlong', 'shrill', 'vignettes', '1957', 'film', 'enjoyable', 'old-fashioned', 'melodrama', 'lead', 'Tatyana', 'Samojlova', 'very', 'appealing', 'fresh-faced', 'sexy', 'very', 'moving', 'when', 'be', 'most', 'famous', 'shot', 'when', 'bid', 'farewell', 'lover', 'headed', 'off', 'war', 'hand-held', 'bus', 'bus', 'track', 'laterally', 'crowd', 'then', 'up', 'up', 'up', 'crane', 'catch', 'view', 'whole', 'street', 'Wonderful', 'montage', 'sequences', 'when', 'raped', 'lover', 'cousin', 'air-raid', 'when', 'panic', 'attack', 'almost', 'kills', 'when', 'lover', 'wounded', 'battle', 'imagines', 'wedding', 'not', 'be', '8/10']",N/A
692874,A2BPDFR58H9575,B0000633SD,Galina,"[9, 9]","It does not surprise me that this short (91 minutes) B/W movie that was made 50 years ago in the Soviet Union during the short period called ""ottepel'"" or ""the thaw"", has gained so much love and admiration among the movie lovers over the world. It is sublime and beautifully filmed. Some scenes feel like there were made way ahead of their time. Sergei Urusevsky's camera work and creative discoveries were included in the text books and widely imitated. The film tells the moving and timeless story of love destroyed by merciless war but eternally alive in the memory of a young woman. It is also the film about loyalty, memories, ability to live on when it seems there is nothing to live for; it is about forgiveness, and about hope. The film received (absolutely deservingly) the Grand Prix at Cannes Film Festival and Tatiana Samoilova was chosen as a recipient of a special award at Cannes for playing Veronika, the young girl happily in love with the best man in the world in the beginning of the movie. After separation with her beloved who went to the front, the loss of her family in the bomb ride, and the marriage to the man she never loved and only wished he never existed, she turned to the shadow of herself, she became dead inside. Her long journey to redemption, to finally accepting death of her beloved and to learning how to live with it, is a fascinating and heartbreaking one and it simply won't leave any viewer indifferent.For me, the movie is very personal and dear because I was born and grew up in the city where its characters lived and were so happy in the beginning. I walked the same streets, squares, and bridges over the Moskva River. Every family in the former Soviet Union had lost at least one but often more than one family member to a combat or to the concentration camp or to the ghetto or to hunger, cold, and illnesses during WWII and my family is not exception. My mother and grandmother knew the horrors of war and never healing pain of losses not just from the movies and the books.

Now, the film itself was made during the 'Soviet Thaw' when film makers were given a bit more freedom with which to work, and it shows in the realism of The Cranes are Flying.  There is no glorification of war here as it is shown for what it is, a brutal event that seperates loved ones and inevitably leads to death and sorrow for most.  There is very little, if any, political propaganda to sift through and the camerawork is absolutely next level.

692888,A39IY0JU5JI69G,B0000633SD,"Promise ""promise""","[4, 9]","I have to say that I appreciate this film more than I really enjoyed it.  Film historians will find a lot to appreciate, too, more than I did.I feel compelled to give my honest impression of the film, for those who may be interested in buying it.  What interested me, personally, was the glimpse inside Soviet society.  I found their clothing, their faces, their homes, their attitudes very interesting. This film was made at the height of the Cold War when Russians were still considered to be very much our enemies.  Here we see people who look a lot like us, and seem to have the same set of human passions and problems.  That may seem obvious to us, now, but as one who remembers keenly the anti-Russian attitudes of those days, I found this probably the most interesting aspect of the filmThe story is very human, and shows the horrors and hardships of war, especially on those left behind.  It focuses on one young woman, Veronika, or ""Squirrel"" as her boyfriend, Boris calls her.We see her before the war, when she and Boris are carefree and she dreams happilly of their wedding and life together.  Then the war breaks out and Boris volunteers.  From then on, Veronika suffers one loss after another and the carefree, rather capricious young girl quickly falls into shock and depression.What I found most moving was the way the family of Boris took her in and cared for her, when she lost her parents.  Boris' father is marvellously played and for my money was the star of the film.  I also loved Boris' grandmother, the sweet old Babushka.What probably kept me from really loving the film was the leading character, Veronika. I didn't find her to be a very sympathetic person. After pledging her undying love to Boris, she suddenly married his cousin, a concert pianist who was very much in love with her.  I could understand that she was frightened and needed protection but what didn't compute for me was the terrible way she treated him after the wedding, even telling him that she wished he had never been born.  Eventually she chased him into the arms of a loose woman and it was revealed that he had bribed his way out of military service. The film was clearly telling us that he was a bad guy. However he was consistently loving and kind to Veronika so I actually found myself more sympathetic to him than to her. I hate to say it but I didn't find the actress who played Veronika particularly interesting or attractive either.  (Spare me your nasty comments!)There are some striking scenes.  My favorite was when the pianist played feverishly on his Steinway for Veronika during a bombing.  Another is the scene when Boris is shot and dies, clutching a birch tree as he goes down, with thoughts of an imaginary wedding with Veronika spinning in his mind.I may be nitpicky to expect the plot to have more psychological reality but that's the way I saw it.  If you are a serious film student and/or love Russian culture then you will probably love this movie. Of course there are always those who are easily impressed by obscure foreign films, especially if they win the Palm d'Or.",3,Interesting Soviet era film,1278806400,"07 11, 2010",2010,3095,"['have', 'say', 'appreciate', 'film', 'more', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Film', 'historians', 'will', 'find', 'lot', 'appreciate', 'too', 'more', 'did.I', 'feel', 'compelled', 'give', 'honest', 'impression', 'film', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'interested', 'buying', 'What', 'interested', 'personally', 'was', 'glimpse', 'Soviet', 'society', 'found', 'clothing', 'homes', 'attitudes', 'very', 'interesting', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'height', 'Cold', 'War', 'when', 'Russians', 'were', 'still', 'considered', 'be', 'very', 'much', 'enemies', 'Here', 'see', 'people', 'who', 'look', 'lot', 'seem', 'have', 'same', 'set', 'human', 'passions', 'problems', 'may', 'seem', 'obvious', 'now', 'one', 'who', 'keenly', 'anti-Russian', 'attitudes', 'days', 'found', 'probably', 'most', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'filmThe', 'story', 'very', 'human', 'horrors', 'hardships', 'war', 'especially', 'left', 'behind', 'one', 'young', 'woman', 'Veronika', 'Squirrel', 'boyfriend', 'Boris', 'her.We', 'see', 'war', 'when', 'Boris', 'are', 'carefree', 'happilly', 'wedding', 'life', 'together', 'Then', 'war', 'out', 'Boris', 'volunteers', 'then', 'Veronika', 'one', 'loss', 'carefree', 'rather', 'capricious', 'young', 'girl', 'quickly', 'shock', 'depression.What', 'found', 'most', 'moving', 'was', 'way', 'family', 'Boris', 'took', 'cared', 'when', 'lost', 'parents', 'Boris', 'father', 'marvellously', 'played', 'money', 'was', 'star', 'film', 'also', 'loved', 'Boris', 'grandmother', 'sweet', 'old', 'Babushka.What', 'probably', 'kept', 'really', 'loving', 'film', 'was', 'leading', 'character', 'Veronika', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'be', 'very', 'sympathetic', 'person', 'pledging', 'undying', 'love', 'Boris', 'suddenly', 'married', 'cousin', 'concert', 'pianist', 'who', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'love', 'could', 'understand', 'was', 'frightened', 'needed', 'protection', 'what', 'did', ""n't"", 'compute', 'was', 'terrible', 'way', 'treated', 'wedding', 'even', 'telling', 'wished', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'born', 'Eventually', 'chased', 'arms', 'loose', 'woman', 'was', 'revealed', 'had', 'bribed', 'way', 'military', 'service', 'film', 'was', 'clearly', 'telling', 'was', 'bad', 'guy', 'However', 'was', 'consistently', 'loving', 'kind', 'Veronika', 'so', 'actually', 'found', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'hate', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'Veronika', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'attractive', 'Spare', 'nasty', 'comments', 'are', 'striking', 'scenes', 'favorite', 'was', 'when', 'pianist', 'played', 'feverishly', 'Steinway', 'Veronika', 'bombing', 'scene', 'when', 'Boris', 'shot', 'dies', 'clutching', 'birch', 'tree', 'down', 'thoughts', 'imaginary', 'wedding', 'Veronika', 'spinning', 'mind.I', 'may', 'be', 'nitpicky', 'expect', 'plot', 'have', 'more', 'psychological', 'reality', 'way', 'saw', 'are', 'serious', 'film', 'student', 'and/or', 'love', 'Russian', 'culture', 'then', 'will', 'probably', 'love', 'movie', 'course', 'are', 'always', 'who', 'are', 'easily', 'impressed', 'obscure', 'foreign', 'films', 'especially', 'win', 'Palm', ""d'Or""]",N/A

692890,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,B0000633SD,Randy Keehn,"[1, 1]","I had read somewhere that ""The Cranes are Flying"" was a rather over-rated Russian movie.  It had won the Cannes Palme d'Or or whatever they call their top award.  I have noticed that a number of the past such awards were for movies that I thought were over-rated (although, in fairness, many of the award winners were outstanding movies).  Thus I was prepared to be sceptical.  However, I was impressed when I saw it last night.  It is a very good (not quite ""great"") movie in my estimation.It begins with scenes of two young lovers.  Their relationship seems destined yet not determined.  We are quickly introduced to the extended families and, before we know it, war breaks out.  I must admit that I wasn't sure just what war this 1960 movie was referring to.  Some of the architecture that we get glimpses of seems post-WWII.  While I don't think that there was ever any specific mention of the enemy, there were too many terms that made it clear this this was WWII (""fascists', ""Stalingrad"", ""Leningrad under siege"", etc).  Our young man, Boris, feels compelled to enlist, much to the dismay of his fiance.  His decision is quick and unquestioned.  One of the best series of scenes in the movie has to do with the lovers parting at the crowded train station.Home life during the war becomes increasingly difficult and there arises a serious problem for the young lady.  At the Front, there is a chillingly beautiful scene in which a soldier is shot.  As he falls, we see, through his eyes, the tree tops spinning while his fondest dreams are brought to view amid those spinning trees.  The home front becomes even more challenging for our heroine.  In time she has to face up to choices that were forced upon her; choices that stain the dreams and asperations of her life with her beloved Boris.  We rediscover a code of ethics for the homefront in a series of impressive scenes.  At the end there is an outstanding scene depicting loneliness in a crowd; misery amidst celebration.  We are left with the realization that wars create victims in ways we don't always appreciate.  At the same time, the cranes remind us that life goes on.I was tempted to put 5 ""stars"" on ""The Cranes are Flying"" but I started thinking of the many movies that have had a greater impact on me than this one.

692891,AFJFXN42RZ3G2,B0000633SD,"R. DelParto ""Rose2""","[2, 2]","Mikhail Kalatozov's THE CRANES ARE FLYING is a cinematic masterpiece.  The film was made during the height of the Cold War, but depicts World War II Russia.  Boris(Alexei Batalov) and Veronica (Tatiana Samoilova) are the two star-crossed lovers who get caught in the whirlwind of war, and are separated when Boris volunteers to go to war to fight against fascism.The plot becomes complicated when Veronica assumes that Boris is not coming back and marries his cousin.  She becomes the focal point of the film, and Kalatozov does a fine job at depicting her changing state of mind after her parents die during an air raid -- from carefree to madness.  One can see how Veronica has become disturbed by her actions, such as in the hospital ward where Boris' father, Byodor Ivanvich (Vasili Merkuriev), tries to calm an injured soldier who becomes upset upon finding out that his girlfriend married another man.The cinematography is exceptional in capturing the dramatic scenes.  The images of World War II Russia are wrenching, but the images of the characters within the modernist infrastructures is artistically attractive to the eye.  Photographer Sergei Urusevsky simulates human chaos with his camera movements, which almost looks like a bird flying out control -- Veronica running side by side with a train amongst a snow covered landscape.  However, the most effective aspect about films, such as Cranes Are Flying is that it is shot in black and white and creates an abstract and ambiguous quality to the film as well as depict the emotions between the characters in their light and dark moods.Overall, The Cranes Are Flying is a recommendable film.  For those not familiar with Russian cinema, this was quite a surprise.  The film captures the images of war and humanity, and brings an understanding of this particular period in Russian history that is not usually portrayed.",5,Understanding  War and Humanity,1173052800,"03 5, 2007",2007,1881,"['Mikhail', 'Kalatozov', 'THE', 'CRANES', 'ARE', 'FLYING', 'cinematic', 'masterpiece', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'height', 'Cold', 'War', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Russia', 'Boris', 'Alexei', 'Batalov', 'Veronica', 'Tatiana', 'Samoilova', 'are', 'two', 'star-crossed', 'lovers', 'who', 'get', 'caught', 'whirlwind', 'war', 'are', 'separated', 'when', 'Boris', 'volunteers', 'go', 'war', 'fight', 'fascism.The', 'plot', 'becomes', 'complicated', 'when', 'Veronica', 'Boris', 'not', 'coming', 'back', 'cousin', 'focal', 'point', 'film', 'Kalatozov', 'fine', 'job', 'depicting', 'changing', 'state', 'mind', 'parents', 'die', 'air', 'raid', 'carefree', 'madness', 'One', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'Veronica', 'become', 'disturbed', 'actions', 'such', 'hospital', 'ward', 'where', 'Boris', 'father', 'Byodor', 'Ivanvich', 'Vasili', 'Merkuriev', 'calm', 'injured', 'soldier', 'who', 'upset', 'finding', 'out', 'girlfriend', 'married', 'man.The', 'cinematography', 'exceptional', 'capturing', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'images', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Russia', 'are', 'wrenching', 'images', 'characters', 'modernist', 'infrastructures', 'artistically', 'attractive', 'eye', 'Sergei', 'Urusevsky', 'human', 'chaos', 'camera', 'movements', 'almost', 'bird', 'flying', 'out', 'control', 'Veronica', 'running', 'side', 'side', 'train', 'snow', 'covered', 'landscape', 'However', 'most', 'effective', 'aspect', 'films', 'such', 'Cranes', 'Are', 'Flying', 'shot', 'black', 'white', 'abstract', 'ambiguous', 'quality', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'depict', 'emotions', 'characters', 'light', 'dark', 'moods.Overall', 'Cranes', 'Are', 'Flying', 'recommendable', 'film', 'not', 'familiar', 'Russian', 'cinema', 'was', 'quite', 'surprise', 'film', 'images', 'war', 'humanity', 'understanding', 'particular', 'period', 'Russian', 'history', 'not', 'usually', 'portrayed']",N/A
692892,A1A71FUA46JTOY,B0000633SD,ric03,"[1, 1]","97 minutes,""The Cranes are Flying"" (Russia, Mikhail Kalatozov, 1957) is quite simply one of the best films that I have seen in ages.The story centres around two young lovers - Boris, an artist and factory worker (Aleksey Batalov) and Veronica (Tatiana Samoilova) -- and the devastating effect that World War Two (Russia's ""Great Patriotic War"") has upon their relationship. It also highlights (being partially set in war-torn Moscow) the losses Russian people face during this catastrophic period.At every moment in this film I was moved. From the opening scenes of romantic innocence (as the carefree lovers frolicked around the city streets) to the later scenes of despair and terror (the Nazi air-raids and burning rubble afterwards), the direction is perfect and constantly challenges your emotional resilience. This isn't like any fifties war film I have seen: it is more like watching a combination of French arthouse cinema and actual, gritty war footage. The lighting is stunning, the sets (including some spectacular outdoor and huge crowd scenes) are evocative, and the story binding it all together is touching. There are also several harrowing Hitchcock-style sequences (such as someone pounding the keys of a piano to drown out the roar of an air-raid) that the great man himself would surely have appreciated. At every level this surpassed my expectations, and I was left wondering why I'd never heard of this film before.The central love-story is acted with great poignancy and passion by the two leads (particularly Samoilova, who portrays a mountain of restrained emotions for someone so young). It is through their initial romance (a memorable opening that is littered with lingering looks and touches, and ballet-like movements as they swirl adoringly around each other) that the later effects of war on those left behind are hammered home to chilling effect.If you like a great war film, if you like foreign films, if you appreciate beautiful and character-driven cinema, then this will leave you mesmorised throughout and leave your appetite whetted for more Russian cinema. It is a simple yet powerful masterpiece that provokes all your emotions, and will sit in the pride of place amongst any collection.",5,Beautiful Russian War Film,1292630400,"12 18, 2010",2010,2227,"['97', 'minutes', 'Cranes', 'are', 'Flying', 'Russia', 'Mikhail', 'Kalatozov', '1957', 'quite', 'simply', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'ages.The', 'story', 'centres', 'two', 'young', 'lovers', 'Boris', 'artist', 'factory', 'worker', 'Aleksey', 'Batalov', 'Veronica', 'Tatiana', 'Samoilova', 'devastating', 'effect', 'World', 'War', 'Two', 'Russia', 'Great', 'Patriotic', 'War', 'upon', 'relationship', 'also', 'being', 'partially', 'set', 'war-torn', 'Moscow', 'losses', 'Russian', 'people', 'face', 'catastrophic', 'period.At', 'moment', 'film', 'was', 'moved', 'opening', 'scenes', 'romantic', 'innocence', 'carefree', 'lovers', 'frolicked', 'city', 'streets', 'later', 'scenes', 'despair', 'terror', 'Nazi', 'air-raids', 'burning', 'rubble', 'afterwards', 'direction', 'perfect', 'constantly', 'emotional', 'resilience', ""n't"", 'like', 'fifties', 'war', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'watching', 'combination', 'French', 'arthouse', 'cinema', 'actual', 'gritty', 'war', 'footage', 'lighting', 'stunning', 'sets', 'including', 'spectacular', 'outdoor', 'huge', 'crowd', 'scenes', 'are', 'evocative', 'story', 'binding', 'together', 'touching', 'are', 'also', 'several', 'harrowing', 'Hitchcock-style', 'sequences', 'such', 'someone', 'pounding', 'keys', 'piano', 'drown', 'out', 'roar', 'air-raid', 'great', 'man', 'would', 'surely', 'have', 'appreciated', 'level', 'surpassed', 'expectations', 'was', 'left', 'wondering', 'why', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'film', 'before.The', 'central', 'love-story', 'acted', 'great', 'poignancy', 'passion', 'two', 'leads', 'particularly', 'Samoilova', 'who', 'mountain', 'restrained', 'emotions', 'someone', 'so', 'young', 'initial', 'romance', 'memorable', 'opening', 'littered', 'lingering', 'looks', 'touches', 'ballet-like', 'movements', 'swirl', 'adoringly', 'other', 'later', 'effects', 'war', 'left', 'behind', 'are', 'hammered', 'home', 'chilling', 'effect.If', 'great', 'war', 'film', 'like', 'foreign', 'films', 'appreciate', 'beautiful', 'character-driven', 'cinema', 'then', 'will', 'leave', 'mesmorised', 'leave', 'appetite', 'whetted', 'more', 'Russian', 'cinema', 'simple', 'yet', 'powerful', 'masterpiece', 'emotions', 'will', 'sit', 'pride', 'place', 'amongst', 'collection']",N/A

Sure Eisenstein is a great director and he made wonderful classics but this is probably the first russian movie that I can identify with the characters since the Eisenstein movies and a few others that I've seen like Earth (Alexander Dovzhenko, 1930) are very political and showing me a culture and a way of life that is interesting and informative but that I can't identify with. This movie tells a simple story about a young couple (Veronika and Boris) that is separated because Boris as to go to war. I think I love this movie so much because it is so open and so full of humanity. It is also very poetic particulary when Boris is at the front and he dreams about his girl back home. But the thing that I admire the most is the superior cinematography, the camera angles are stunning and the close-ups (very close) are almost disturbing because you feel that you are spying on them or following them anywhere they go. Also, great scenes with hand held cameras and used wisely not just to use it but at chosen moments to accentuate dramatic scenes or to show chaos during this time of war. It amaze me that a great reference for  cinematography like that is not use or missuse in movies today. If you can, try to catch the movie I am Cuba with the same great director and the same wonderful cinematography, the story is political but unlike early russian movies of Eisenstein and such, the characters are warmer and you can identify with them.",5,My favorite russian classic,1025654400,"07 3, 2002",2002,1536,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'soviet', 'cinema', 'saw', 'great', 'movie', 'few', 'months', 'ago', 'Sure', 'Eisenstein', 'great', 'director', 'made', 'wonderful', 'classics', 'probably', 'first', 'russian', 'movie', 'can', 'identify', 'characters', 'Eisenstein', 'movies', 'few', 'others', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Earth', 'Alexander', 'Dovzhenko', '1930', 'are', 'very', 'political', 'showing', 'culture', 'way', 'life', 'interesting', 'informative', 'ca', ""n't"", 'identify', 'movie', 'simple', 'story', 'young', 'couple', 'Veronika', 'Boris', 'separated', 'because', 'Boris', 'go', 'war', 'think', 'love', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'so', 'open', 'so', 'full', 'humanity', 'also', 'very', 'poetic', 'particulary', 'when', 'Boris', 'front', 'girl', 'back', 'home', 'thing', 'admire', 'most', 'superior', 'cinematography', 'camera', 'angles', 'are', 'stunning', 'close-ups', 'very', 'close', 'are', 'almost', 'disturbing', 'feel', 'are', 'spying', 'following', 'anywhere', 'go', 'Also', 'great', 'scenes', 'hand', 'held', 'cameras', 'used', 'wisely', 'not', 'just', 'use', 'chosen', 'moments', 'accentuate', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'show', 'chaos', 'time', 'war', 'amaze', 'great', 'reference', 'cinematography', 'not', 'use', 'missuse', 'movies', 'today', 'can', 'try', 'catch', 'movie', 'am', 'Cuba', 'same', 'great', 'director', 'same', 'wonderful', 'cinematography', 'story', 'political', 'early', 'russian', 'movies', 'Eisenstein', 'such', 'characters', 'are', 'warmer', 'can', 'identify']",N/A
