Girls, jiggly boobs, panties, etc with a smidgen of plot thrown in. It does have all of those things but the dialogue is intelligent and thought provoking. The action is well paced and animated and the last three episodes really do grip you. I was sitting on the edge of my seat waiting to see what happened.This top grade A anime to be put in the same class as Rosario and Vampire and Ikki Tousen. (Sekirei and Heaven's lost property being the B-team). So whilst it might be a guilty please it is a real pleasure. They even eave open the possibility of a second series.

He thinks he can never get a girlfriend until a young lady named Yuma asked to go out.  When they have their first date, it also ends up being their last as she grows wings and stabs him with a spear of light.  As he dies, a vision in red hair and a big chest arrives and tells him she is her master.  The next day, he wakes up naked with her in his bed.  Later he learns that she and her friends (the school Lolita, the busty upperclassman, and the most popular boy in school) are all devils (and you would rather deal with a devil over a demon.  Devils make a pact and honor it, demons just want to play with your insides - even if you do not want them to.) and so is he and the one who tried to kill him was a Fallen Angel.  He will learn that he has a special power but can he learn to harness it to protect him, his friends and possibly one he cares about.Despite the high Ecchi level, there is a story under all the adult themes.  Issei is actually not a bad person, despite his perverse behavior, he is willing to help those who needs it.

It seemed to combine all the bad elements of this type of anime: a completely unlikeable &#34;hero,&#34; female characters so pneumatic they look deformed, and a plot so farfetched that the viewer is in danger of brain-lock.But when the character Asia is introduced, it begins to change for the better. Suddenly the hero has something to think about that doesn't reside in his pants, and the viewer has something to look at that doesn't resemble a cart full of watermelons. The storyline itself gets much more interesting once there are characters one gives a damn about.I had hopes for the series at this point, but alas, they are dashed by the weak ending.

The storyline, humor, action, animation, music and dialogue is all blended together; which is guaranteed to satisfy any nerd.I have heard a lot of criticism about this anime, which I'm sure you've all heard as well. Honestly, I don't know what these critics were expecting. This anime is about sexy demons killing fallen angels in the battle between good and evil. This is what we called &#34;Entertainment.&#34; If you were looking for something different, like &#34;What's the meaning of life?;&#34; then you definitely should stay away from this anime.Regardless, this anime is a must-buy for all fans of anime, especially if you like anime such as Sekirei, Queen's Blade and Sora No Otoshimono. The action is great, the humor is hilarious, the characters all have some development, and there are even some heart-felt moments where you're motivated to do the same as the characters. The music is AWESOME and the extras making the purchase well worth it.Funimation did a great job dubbing this series. Personally, I like the subbed version better, only because I feel like I can take it more seriously than listening to some cheesy dialogue. Still, it's worth watching at least once.Now, High School DXD New (Second season) was released in Japan in October 2013.

1538855,A2F0UY1SIZ37LE,B007VUKO80,Jason T. Del Sol,"[0, 0]","I first came across this series after discussing what fansubs (that is to say, un-licensed anime that is not professionally translated) my friends would be getting for the winter 2012 lineup, this title came to mind. the last time i had downloaded ANYTHING resembling fanservice was Queen's Blade in 2008, and that series was so heavy in the fan-service i felt i needed a hot shower to clean the muck off of myself. so when i heard that this was a pretty 'servicey' show, i had my doubts.after downloading episode one though, i was shocked. yes, there was nudity. yes the character was an incorrigible lech, what amazed me is that they actually MADE THE PREMISE WORK. Issei was unashamed of his unbridled libido and his desire to see women's boobs. even as his girlfriend is MURDERING him, all he can think of is that her breasts were wasted since he only got to see them for a few seconds. Usually, if im being stabbed to death by a loved one, i would tend to surmise that breasts would be the least of my worried. That he is once again hunted by another fallen angel, bringing the whole 'cavalry' running was a sidestep, but when he wakes up naked next to a just-as-naked Rias Gremory, the most sought after campus idol, and doesnt totally recollect how he got there - okay, Awkward....but instead, we have female characters who are in control of their sexuality. hell, instead of pummeling poor Issei like most decent harem shows, Rias tells him to look as much as he wants to. admitted, he is shocked by it, and doesnt resist much or even make much of a statement as she dresses in lingerie that would probably make a Victoria's secret model say 'daaaaaayum'as the series progresses we get even more fan-service, in the first instance is a nameless rogue devil the cast has to eliminate, in which we meet the rest of the cast (Yuto, the Knight; Koneko, the Rook; and Akeno; the Queen to Rias' King) in which once again, breasts become the primary focus of Issei leading to comical results.which is the amazing thing about this, as a fan-service show: it actually makes the fan-service part of the plot, and NOT just something to titilate the viewer:case in point: the whole reason Rias is naked is that she can heal Issei's would totally with skin-to-skin contact, which is a staple gag about couples stranded in icy environments having to share body heat.we see that the nudity is not just fun and games with the rogue devil for, despite her rather beautiful human appearance, she's actually a centauresque creature who has a human torso from the hips up along the waist of the monster, despite her beauty, its meant as a distraction as her own powers make her quite lethal to a normal person.and as the series progresses, Issei's own desires (to be master of his own harem) are actually encouraged by Rias but it becomes soon apparent that having a harem like that will be an uphill battle due to his lowly status (that of the pawn) but can be 'promoted' for working hard.the girls of the series are all about taking charge and easily match their male counterparts, though Issei is truly king of the libido in the series. even many of his eventual 'special' moves are based on rendering his target naked (which leads to many gags about its name 'dress breaker')the fan-service continues on to season 2 (which just wrapped up a season or two ago in japan) and still appears to have room for a third season as well.",5,Fanservice that serves more than one purpose?,1390003200,"01 18, 2014",2014,3419,"['first', 'came', 'series', 'discussing', 'what', 'fansubs', 'say', 'un-licensed', 'anime', 'not',
