1650245,A3UC6M6CZUPVGW,B00CQGLD9S,"A. J. Jewler ""Retired..and loving it.""","[2, 10]","When ""At Long Last Love"" was withdrawn from release shortly after its opening and its savaging by the critics, I had to wonder if the film could really be that awful. So when it popped up on amazon a few weeks ago--and in blu-ray yet--I took a chance, believing that even if it wasn't the perfect musical, it had to have some redeeming graces. My wife and I watched it in silence a few nights ago. I didn't look at her and I don't think she was looking at me. We couldn't take our eyes off the screen--not because the movie was so engaging, but because it wasn't engaging either of us at all. It reminded me of the scene in Mel Brooks' ""The Producers,"" when the audience is frozen with shock when ""Springtime for Hitler"" begins. If anyone wants my copy they can have it. I might even pay postage, just to get the abomination out of the house. Do not--under any circumstances--purchase this item unless you are a fan of self-flagellation. Even the Cole Porter songs do not sound witty in this miss-mash of a movie. I could say more, but if you haven't gotten the point by now, you'll have to buy the damned thing to find out.At Long Last Love '75 [Blu-ray]",1,why did they bother remastering this mess in blu-ray??,1373155200,"07 7, 2013",2013,1155,"['When', 'Long', 'Last', 'Love', 'was', 'withdrawn', 'release', 'shortly', 'opening', 'savaging', 'critics', 'had', 'wonder', 'film', 'could', 'really', 'be', 'awful', 'So', 'when', 'popped', 'up', 'amazon', 'few', 'weeks', 'ago', 'blu-ray', 'yet', 'took', 'chance', 'believing', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'musical', 'had', 'have', 'redeeming', 'graces', 'wife', 'watched', 'silence', 'few', 'nights', 'ago', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'looking', 'could', ""n't"", 'take', 'eyes', 'screen', 'not', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'engaging', 'was', ""n't"", 'engaging', 'reminded', 'scene', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'Producers', 'when', 'audience', 'frozen', 'shock', 'when', 'Springtime', 'Hitler', 'anyone', 'copy', 'can', 'have', 'might', 'even', 'pay', 'postage', 'just', 'get', 'abomination', 'house', 'Do', 'not', 'circumstances', 'purchase', 'item', 'are', 'fan', 'self-flagellation', 'Even', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'songs', 'do', 'not', 'sound', 'witty', 'miss-mash', 'movie', 'could', 'say', 'more', 'have', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'point', 'now', ""'ll"", 'have', 'buy', 'damned', 'thing', 'find', 'out.At', 'Long', 'Last', 'Love', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']']",At Long Last Love '75
1650246,A2X34UWD1ZFD02,B00CQGLD9S,"Alec Howe ""buffguy""","[7, 7]","Having seen this film many times over the years in its broadcast TV incarnations (three to be exact - the 121 min. complete cut, the 115 min. theatrical release that begins with ""Which?"" and the hasty 98 min. re-edit following the yank from theaters), a few things blew me away when viewing the Blu-ray.First, the absolutely unexpected reprise of ""From Alpha to Omega,"" which I never even knew existed. Having two more minutes of Kahn to treasure was too much to expect.  It's a joy.Second: how absolutely charming Duilio Del Prete is in this film. His name has always gotten lost in the shuffle when people discuss the movie, for reasons easy to understand, but Del Prete is a sprite of good humor and effervescent charm in a film dependent on these traits.  So little is known of his life, and the remainder of his career was spent in Europe, so AT LONG LAST LOVE is precious to me because Del Prete was a special performer, incredibly endearing, and this film captures his essence so beautifully.Finally, there is a revelation that had never occurred to me until now: I had always assumed, like most people, that the project was simply done at the wrong time, with a cast ill-suited to the genre, but that's simply not the case. In retrospect, Cybill Shepherd is the only fish out of water among a cast that is pitch perfect and to the era born. Despite any lack of musical gifts, Reynolds glides through his role with a sense of fun that could only be mustered by a man coasting on his position as the top box office star in the world. Kahn and Brennan were rooted in musical theatre, so their bountiful contributions are to be expected.  Del Prete, as aforementioned, glows.  And Hillerman and Natwick bring years of memorable character work to the table. In high-def, restored and resplendent, it is Shepherd alone whose tone is off.  Her every instinct is mistaken, and one gets the feeling that Bogdanovich was so blinded on a personal level that he couldn't see her with objectivity in the rushes.  The role of Brooke is not as fleshed out as the others, and Shepherd's reading of it is best summed up by the scene in which she raps Reynolds with her fist and he cowers, ""You're strong, do you know that?""  She's actually right for the role physically, and if Brooke had been written and Cybill directed with a sure and steady hand, one gathers she could have tapped into the same pool of charm as her fellow performers did.  But she's the one wrong note, and the sheer amount of footage in which she appears ends up setting an unfortunate tone for the whole enterprise.  It's a shame, because she has some terrific moments - anything having to do with the eyeglasses, the ""I Loved Him"" duet with Kahn, and ""You're the Top"" with Del Prete.  While her colleagues have accessed the time machine to venture back to 1935, she seems left behind in the 1970s, in look, in style, in appeal. And I speak as a fan of hers.While appreciating the blu-ray, the finished product sets up two glaring mysteries: why Bogdanovich didn't (a) include Natwick and Brennan's excised numbers in some capacity on this release and (b) do an audio commentary, when he seems to pop up, ascot in tow, hat tipped in tribute, in the special features of every disc on the market.  It would seem this whole experience may have been too painful to relive with the world at large, frame by frame.  But I am thankful for his recent blogs about this film. It's hard to explain -  those of us who are attached to it to such an extent when it continues to be reviled by the greater population. Maybe you had to be there.  AT LONG LAST LOVE remains a brave experiment by a man who loves movies, but who loved Cybill just a little more.",5,At Long Last...,1375142400,"07 30, 2013",2013,3706,"['Having', 'seen', 'film', 'many', 'times', 'years', 'broadcast', 'TV', 'incarnations', 'three', 'be', 'exact', '121', 'min', 'complete', 'cut', '115', 'min', 'theatrical', 'release', 'Which', 'hasty', '98', 'min', 're-edit', 'following', 'yank', 'theaters', 'few', 'things', 'blew', 'away', 'when', 'viewing', 'Blu-ray.First', 'absolutely', 'unexpected', 'reprise', 'From', 'Alpha', 'Omega', 'never', 'even', 'knew', 'existed', 'Having', 'two', 'more', 'minutes', 'Kahn', 'treasure', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'expect', 'joy.Second', 'how', 'absolutely', 'charming', 'Duilio', 'Del', 'Prete', 'film', 'name', 'always', 'gotten', 'lost', 'shuffle', 'when', 'people', 'discuss', 'movie', 'reasons', 'easy', 'understand', 'Del', 'Prete', 'sprite', 'good', 'humor', 'effervescent', 'charm', 'film', 'dependent', 'traits', 'So', 'little', 'known', 'life', 'remainder', 'career', 'was', 'spent', 'Europe', 'so', 'AT', 'LONG', 'LAST', 'LOVE', 'precious', 'Del', 'Prete', 'was', 'special', 'performer', 'incredibly', 'endearing', 'film', 'essence', 'so', 'beautifully.Finally', 'revelation', 'had', 'never', 'occurred', 'now', 'had', 'always', 'assumed', 'most', 'people', 'project', 'was', 'simply', 'done', 'wrong', 'time', 'cast', 'ill-suited', 'genre', 'simply', 'not', 'case', 'retrospect', 'Cybill', 'Shepherd', 'only', 'fish', 'water', 'cast', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'era', 'born', 'lack', 'musical', 'gifts', 'Reynolds', 'role', 'sense', 'fun', 'could', 'only', 'be', 'mustered', 'man', 'coasting', 'position', 'top', 'box', 'office', 'star', 'world', 'Kahn', 'Brennan', 'were', 'rooted', 'musical', 'theatre', 'bountiful', 'contributions', 'are', 'be', 'expected', 'Del', 'Prete', 'aforementioned', 'glows', 'Hillerman', 'Natwick', 'bring', 'years', 'memorable', 'character', 'work', 'table', 'high-def', 'restored', 'resplendent', 'Shepherd', 'alone', 'tone', 'off', 'instinct', 'mistaken', 'one', 'feeling', 'Bogdanovich', 'was', 'so', 'blinded', 'personal', 'level', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'objectivity', 'rushes', 'role', 'Brooke', 'not', 'fleshed', 'out', 'others', 'Shepherd', 'reading', 'best', 'summed', 'up', 'scene', 'Reynolds', 'fist', ""'re"", 'strong', 'do', 'know', 'actually', 'right', 'role', 'physically', 'Brooke', 'had', 'been', 'written', 'Cybill', 'directed', 'sure', 'steady', 'hand', 'one', 'gathers', 'could', 'have', 'tapped', 'same', 'pool', 'charm', 'fellow', 'performers', 'did', 'one', 'wrong', 'note', 'sheer', 'amount', 'footage', 'up', 'setting', 'unfortunate', 'tone', 'whole', 'enterprise', 'shame', 'terrific', 'moments', 'anything', 'having', 'do', 'eyeglasses', 'Loved', 'Him', 'duet', 'Kahn', ""'re"", 'Top', 'Del', 'Prete', 'colleagues', 'have', 'accessed', 'time', 'machine', 'venture', 'back', '1935', 'left', 'behind', '1970s', 'look', 'style', 'appeal', 'speak', 'fan', 'hers.While', 'appreciating', 'blu-ray', 'finished', 'product', 'up', 'two', 'glaring', 'mysteries', 'why', 'Bogdanovich', 'did', ""n't"", 'include', 'Natwick', 'Brennan', 'excised', 'numbers', 'capacity', 'release', 'b', 'do', 'audio', 'commentary', 'when', 'pop', 'up', 'ascot', 'tow', 'hat', 'tipped', 'tribute', 'special', 'features', 'disc', 'market', 'would', 'seem', 'whole', 'experience', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'painful', 'relive', 'world', 'large', 'frame', 'frame', 'am', 'thankful', 'recent', 'blogs', 'film', 'hard', 'explain', 'who', 'are', 'attached', 'extent', 'when', 'be', 'reviled', 'greater', 'population', 'Maybe', 'had', 'be', 'there', 'AT', 'LONG', 'LAST', 'LOVE', 'brave', 'experiment', 'man', 'who', 'movies', 'who', 'loved', 'Cybill', 'just', 'little', 'more']",At Long Last Love '75

Unseen by millions, an absolute joy, with a superb cast, stunning production design, and of course, Cole, all the way. Long before all the fuss about Les Mis and the 'groundbreaking' live musical recording, Bogdanovich used this method for absolute spontaneity, employed in the earliest musicals. In his own words, taken from the movie soundtrack album, he states 'I didn't want to make a musical that was about singing and dancing: I wanted to make a musical about some people who sing and dance instead of walk and talk'. What a fantastic movie, and i can't wait to recapture the excitement, on seeing it several times on its original release.

1650248,A25UZ7MA72SMKM,B00CQGLD9S,Brent Butler,"[16, 18]","Obviously, I was of the first of the two opinions in my title. I saw ""At Long Last Love"" in its premier at Radio City Music Hall, and again in my then home town of Jacksonville, Florida, a few weeks later.I've been following the progress of this Blu-ray release for about 18 months now, and word on the street was that it is a superior cut and has been restored the ""right"" way. Having just watched it, the transfer is not pristine, but it does match up to a number of Blu rays I own, for example ""The Man from Snowy River"" and ""Stardust"", both of which show a lot of grain and actually look better if I don't wear my glasses when watching them. LOL However, once the horrible looking 20th Century Fox intro is done, nothing about the look of the film will distract you from enjoying the story.The soundtrack is nothing special. In fact it is apparently Mono (listed as 1.0). Once again, while it does not have the full, rich sound that we've come to expect from most DVDs and Blu rays, the charm in this movie is in the acting and the story, and you won't be displeased.This Blu ray version runs 123 minutes, which is 5 minutes more than the theatrical release (according to IMDB.com). Most likely an extra song sequence was added back in.The story essentially relates one long social engagement concerning the four stars. It is light-hearted and cheerful, and filled with great Cole Porter songs. It has a wonderful throwback look to early 30s style, with highly artistic use of stark black and white in scenery and costume, accomplished with an excellent flair. I've always thought that was an homage to black and white films of that era without actually presenting the film in black and white.Contrary to what some have written about this movie, none of the stars do embarrassing work with their singing. Reynolds certainly isn't known for singing, but his performance is competent in this film, as is Cybil Shepard's. What you absolutely DO get here are the actors ""acting the songs"", and in a very entertaining fashion. It adds an air of authenticity and charm that doesn't come across in absolutely flawless dubbed performances.Madeline Kahn was of course a wonderful singer. Eileen Brennan and John Hillerman not only sing well, but provide unforgettable stretches of comedy ... she as Cybil Shepard's maid, and Hillerman as Reynold's chauffeur. Duilio Del Prete is charming and amusing as the romantic foreigner with a bit of a gambling problem.One thing that disposes me towards good memories of this film is that I had a fun date with a great looking young lady when I saw it in Jacksonville ... a girl named Anita (So for any of you Anita's who saw this that spring in Jacksonville with a freshman from Ga Tech that year, Hi Anita!).Letting actors with no ""singing chops"" do their own vocals had not been done a lot by the time this film was made ... ""Paint your Wagon"" comes to mind ... so maybe that was one of the reasons that critics panned this LIKE the gold pans in ""Paint Your Wagon"" when they came up all sand. It has been done a LOT more since this film, and with many more misses on the singing quality.As my wife and I watched this Blu ray, we found ourselves frequently chuckling at both clear dialogue and physical bits, especially from Burt Reynolds, who has always been adroit at mugging and showing off for the camera in amusing ways.If you don't like light romantic comedies which segue into song from time to time, just don't buy or watch this film. Otherwise, it is definitely worth taking a chance on. Cybil and Burt never looked better. John Hillerman gives you a peek at what would become the role of his career on ""Magnum PI"". Madeline Kahn is simply the great Madeline Kahn, and Eileen Brennan is a riot.Highly recommended.",5,Love it or hate it,1369612800,"05 27, 2013",2013,3759,"['Obviously', 'was', 'first', 'two', 'opinions', 'title', 'saw', 'Long', 'Last', 'Love', 'premier', 'Radio', 'City', 'Music', 'Hall', 'again', 'then', 'home', 'town', 'Jacksonville', 'Florida', 'few', 'weeks', 'later.I', ""'ve"", 'been', 'following', 'progress', 'Blu-ray', 'release', '18', 'months', 'now', 'word', 'street', 'was', 'superior', 'cut', 'been', 'restored', 'right', 'way', 'Having', 'just', 'watched', 'transfer', 'not', 'pristine', 'match', 'up', 'number', 'Blu', 'own', 'example', 'Man', 'Snowy', 'River', 'Stardust', 'show', 'lot', 'grain', 'actually', 'look', 'better', 'do', ""n't"", 'wear', 'glasses', 'when', 'watching', 'LOL', 'However', 'once', 'horrible', 'looking', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'intro', 'done', 'nothing', 'look', 'film', 'will', 'distract', 'enjoying', 'story.The', 'soundtrack', 'nothing', 'special', 'fact', 'apparently', 'Mono', 'listed', '1.0', 'Once', 'again', 'not', 'have', 'full', 'rich', 'sound', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'most', 'DVDs', 'Blu', 'rays', 'charm', 'movie', 'acting', 'story', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'displeased.This', 'Blu', 'ray', 'version', '123', 'minutes', '5', 'minutes', 'more', 'theatrical', 'release', 'according', 'IMDB.com', 'Most', 'likely', 'extra', 'song', 'sequence', 'was', 'added', 'back', 'in.The', 'story', 'essentially', 'one', 'long', 'social', 'engagement', 'concerning', 'four', 'stars', 'light-hearted', 'cheerful', 'filled', 'great', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'songs', 'wonderful', 'throwback', 'look', 'early', '30s', 'style', 'highly', 'artistic', 'use', 'stark', 'black', 'white', 'scenery', 'costume', 'accomplished', 'excellent', 'flair', ""'ve"", 'always', 'thought', 'was', 'homage', 'black', 'white', 'films', 'era', 'actually', 'presenting', 'film', 'black', 'white.Contrary', 'what', 'have', 'written', 'movie', 'none', 'stars', 'do', 'embarrassing', 'work', 'singing', 'Reynolds', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'known', 'singing', 'performance', 'competent', 'film', 'Cybil', 'Shepard', 'What', 'absolutely', 'DO', 'get', 'here', 'are', 'actors', 'acting', 'songs', 'very', 'entertaining', 'fashion', 'air', 'authenticity', 'charm', ""n't"", 'come', 'absolutely', 'flawless', 'dubbed', 'performances.Madeline', 'Kahn', 'was', 'course', 'wonderful', 'singer', 'Eileen', 'Brennan', 'John', 'Hillerman', 'not', 'only', 'sing', 'well', 'provide', 'unforgettable', 'stretches', 'comedy', 'Cybil', 'Shepard', 'maid', 'Hillerman', 'Reynold', 'chauffeur', 'Duilio', 'Del', 'Prete', 'charming', 'amusing', 'romantic', 'foreigner', 'bit', 'gambling', 'problem.One', 'thing', 'good', 'memories', 'film', 'had', 'fun', 'date', 'great', 'looking', 'young', 'lady', 'when', 'saw', 'Jacksonville', 'girl', 'named', 'Anita', 'So', 'Anita', 'who', 'saw', 'spring', 'Jacksonville', 'freshman', 'Ga', 'Tech', 'year', 'Hi', 'Anita', '.Letting', 'actors', 'singing', 'chops', 'do', 'own', 'vocals', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'done', 'lot', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'Paint', 'Wagon', 'mind', 'so', 'maybe', 'was', 'one', 'reasons', 'critics', 'panned', 'LIKE', 'gold', 'Paint', 'Wagon', 'when', 'came', 'up', 'sand', 'been', 'done', 'LOT', 'more', 'film', 'many', 'more', 'misses', 'singing', 'quality.As', 'wife', 'watched', 'Blu', 'ray', 'found', 'frequently', 'chuckling', 'clear', 'dialogue', 'physical', 'bits', 'especially', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'who', 'always', 'been', 'adroit', 'mugging', 'showing', 'off', 'camera', 'amusing', 'ways.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'light', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'segue', 'song', 'time', 'time', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'watch', 'film', 'Otherwise', 'definitely', 'worth', 'taking', 'chance', 'Cybil', 'Burt', 'never', 'looked', 'better', 'John', 'Hillerman', 'peek', 'what', 'would', 'become', 'role', 'career', 'Magnum', 'PI', 'Madeline', 'Kahn', 'simply', 'great', 'Madeline', 'Kahn', 'Eileen', 'Brennan', 'riot.Highly', 'recommended']",At Long Last Love '75

Of all the movies I have had on my list to get since DVD came out, this is the only one that was not released.  I could understand why at the time it wasn't attracting audiences.  Musicals were dead.  They sung live!  Like in Les Miserables (fortunately they had much better equipment to use for that).  I feel bad the director never got to know how many people actually loved this movie.  I can't wait to finally see this in widescreen!  Burt Reynolds was a hoot singing and dancing.  Cybil Shepard was absolutely adorable.  There aren't too many movies with the late great Madeleine Kahn, so that alone is worth the watch.  Eileen Brennan with that deadpan delivery - priceless!  ""Most Gentlemen Don't Like Love"" is on my list of all the great movie showstoppers.  ""But baby if I'm the bottom, you're the top"".  I had no idea what that meant at 11, but it started a life long love and admiration for one of the great composers of all time and all the shows and movies that showcased his work.  This gem deserves to be among them!  UPDATE:  After finally getting it in the mail I don't think I ever enjoyed it this much!  I am so glad for the subtitles to finally clearly know the lyrics.  I was singing along!  The long shots of live performances really impressed me.  I never looked at them at how difficult it must have been.  It's like music is playing at a party and someone just starts singing along, but does it very well.  Roger Ebert was my favorite critic and it is nice to see a positive excerpt of his review on the box.

Risoli ""black farmer""","[2, 7]","Oh, give me the failures of Peter Bogdanovich's next failed masterpiece when the the forced slapstick fell flat but there was an inventiveness still to it and it was not in such a grand scale.  Yes, allowing Bogdanovich to have a DVD release with a black-and-white version, something once again those awful studios forced the famous director to do, make the film in color when it was originally meant to be in black-and-white.  (And, at least for the DVD release of ""Nickelodeon"" (1977) we were given the Director's Cut of ""The Last Picture Show"" for our money).  But then, we must remember, Bogdanovich had just prior had his been allowed to make his big flop musical ""At Long Last Love"" in 1975 based on a script by Bogdanovich on interconnecting a lot of some expressively dated Cole Porter songs tied to a cliched and very slight story.  At least in ""What's Up, Doc?"" a similarly conceived idea to lovingly present a pastiche to screwball comedies, but at least it had an intelligent narrative.  With ""At Long Last Love"", the idea is to lovingly present a pastiche to madcap musicals (and according to Bogdanovich, where the characters just happen to sing and dance to tell their stories, which allowed him, to current audiences to believe, his technique to allow non-singing actors and actresses to sing without re-dubbing their less than stellar song deliveries.  It is called a ""direct-sound musical"" and the recent filmization of ""Les Miserables"" is the first critically successful outcome of such ""experiments.""  When a big budget film allows mistakes to be caught in the final product, a director is getting careless.  Such were some of the failures of ""Nickelodeon.""  You know when you anticipate things will happen, but I hope they don't, then they do, the direction is less than inspired and, in the case of ""At Long Last Love"" clumsy.  And one feels that the marketing scheme to present ""At Long Last Love"" only in a costly Blu-ray edition is an attempt to finally make up the lost dollars the film racked up when it was removed shortly after its release in a director's cut (without a director's commentary) is another costly ploy.  Burt Reynolds and Cybill Sheperd never looked better, but neither, nor could anyone else in the cast (Madeline Kahn, Dulio Del Prete, Eileen Brennan, John Hillerman and Mildred Natwick) make a memorable character or not look downright stupid in failed contrived antics.  Not only was Bogdanovich clumsy with his direction, but the writing seems amateurish.  The film has a sense of not fully filling its own shoes and being narcissistic.  This attempt to re-calculate the film's credibility and Bogdanovich's fall from grace as a gifted and commanding director should appropriately arouse suspicions.  The film is an interesting experiment, but still a failure. It makes what it idolizes, those madcap musicals of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, seem inordinately and superiorly edifying.

1650264,A1OX3O1B6HKCUV,B00CQGLD9S,"William G. Harris ""Bill""","[43, 47]","One Sunday, in Cleveland, Peter Bogdanovich came for a talk to the Cleveland Public Library downtown. It was about a book he'd just written. This had to be about twelve or so years ago. I brought my original movie poster of At Long Last Love & my original LP soundtrack of Paper Moon. I not only wanted to get his autograph on both (which I did), but I just wanted to tell him EXACTLY what I thought of At long Last Love. I said how this film was a brilliant amalgamation of both the RKO-Pandro S. Berman musicals of Fred Astaire & Ginger Rogers, and relations between the sexes circa the sexual reveloution of the 1970's. This film is one of the best I've ever seen about intrapersonal communication between and amoungst the sexes, using the lyrics of Cole Porter (a brilliant composer and closeted homosexual who had lyrics with hidden meanings rampant throughout his entire career--lyrics designed to express true feelings and yearnings without being too too literal). In spite of this, the film appears to be, superficially, a light and frothy period piece. I love all the performances, but, let's be frank, they are uneven at best. There are those who feel Cybill Shepherd can sing and dance, and those who do not. There is NO inbetween! I feel she can...As I do about Burt Reynolds--but he really can't. I feel his charms work in spite of this, some people do not (I guess it's all in the eye of the beholder)...The rest of the cast I feel is stellar, in particular the byplay between Eileen Brennan & John Hillerman. Brilliant! Madeline Kahn is her usual magnificent self. And, about Mr. Bogdanovich's brave and foolhardy decision to spend approx. $6 million of 20th Century-Fox's money to film his cast LIVE singing and dancing before the camera...? In hindsight, I will forever be sorry it changed his career the way that it did, but I always felt, and will always feel, it made for a more real and feeling finished product.
