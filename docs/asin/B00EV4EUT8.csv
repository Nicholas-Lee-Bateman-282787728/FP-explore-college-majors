It was such painful scene to watch a black man and bunch of white men standing at the door of the president's bathroom, listening to ranting of a president who took a bold step in freeing black men.  If all that was shown in the movie is true then no wonder about the anger that is felt in the African American community.

I can't say enough great things about it. I highly recommend the movie and while it does have a few apocryphal scenes that may never have taken place in real life, the dramatic license that Daniels takes is quite understanding.Forest Whitaker again gives an Oscar-worthy performance. The first scene of the movie is quite shocking so I do not recommend it for women or children; it is that shocking and terrifying. To me real life violence is more terrifying than something I see in an action movie like Rambo or Die-Hard. When you see it and what subsequently happened to people at the sit-ins and Freedom Rides, you will be shocked and angered all at the same time.When this comes out on DVD I will be one of the first to buy it.A.

1668973,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00EV4EUT8,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 8]","I am not one who considers Lee Daniels a competent filmmaker.  I know that he has an Oscar nomination for his direction of &#8216;Precious&#8217; (a film that I personally think was pulled back from greatness thanks in large part to Daniels&#8217; shoddy direction) but at the end of the day, this is about personal taste, and while he seems to have a way with actors he really doesn&#8217;t understand film composition very well.  All of his films (that I&#8217;ve seen) suffer in the very basic way they are constructed, feeling unfocused from start to finish.  He has some ideas that could work, but they would need a skilled filmmaker to give them the heft they need to make a real impact and not feel like a poorly executed gimmick.Oh, where do I begin?&#8216;The Butler&#8217;, or more exactly, &#8216;Lee Daniels&#8217; The Butler&#8217; (the title is already pretentious) tells the true story of Cecil Gaines, although the REAL Cecil Gaines was not really named Cecil Gaines and so immediately it gets you wondering how much of this is true and not exaggerated in order to make this man&#8217;s life feel more relevant than it really was.  Cecil grew up on a cotton farm, which was all he knew (as we are told, quite unnecessarily, by Forest Whitaker in voiceover), until his father was shot dead and his mother went crazy and he was brought inside the home to learn how to serve.  Then he grows up and leaves (Why wasn&#8217;t this explained better?  Was his family slaves?  Were they mere workers?  If they were workers then WHY did they put up with what they did and why did their employers get away with what they did, and if they were slaves then how could he just walk away from it all?).  He gets a job, a wife and eventually a big opportunity; to serve as a butler in the White House.He&#8217;s there for thirty years, and in the process becomes the Forrest Gump of the Washington D.C., observing the goings on of term after term and President after President and subtle affecting things in the process.Maybe too subtly.A major problem with &#8216;Lee Daniels&#8217; The Butler&#8217; is that Cecil Gaines is a very boring character to play.  I understand that the man is repressed for a reason, trained and taught to be invisible (they make sure we are aware of this) but those characters are rarely interesting to watch unless the actor in the role knows how to emote tremendously through the eyes.  There are actors who have taken on these roles and sung, but Whitaker doesn&#8217;t do too well.  It doesn&#8217;t help him that the makeup department makes his face look like it is literally melting about halfway through, which is a true distraction.  In fact, Cecil is the least interesting aspect of this film, and the fact that he is supposed to carry it on his shoulders is a shame.  I would have much rather had the film solely focus on his son, Louis (a tremendous performance by David Oyelowo, who really deserved a better film), who has a real arc and develops such a well-rounded character throughout this film.But he&#8217;s the only one, which is unfortunate.  There are so many characters who seemingly have key roles (all those Presidents) and yet they are given such little screen time in order to develop those roles.  Each President is given MAYBE four minutes of screen time and most of which is degraded in moments of nothing.  We see Eisenhower paint, Nixon yell, Kennedy introduce his family, Johnson poop and Reagan eat dinner.  This great cast of characters (and actors) is given NOTHING to do.  Sure, they aren&#8217;t the main characters, and so we shouldn&#8217;t expect them to take over, but the film never develops much on the home front either (outside of some sparsely brushed clich&eacute;s) and with all the jumping from alcoholic Oprah to some random President to Louis&#8217;s personal journey then back to Oprah, the film never finds needed footing to develop a complete story.And don&#8217;t even get me started on the film&#8217;s ridiculously tacked on Obama fueled finale.I want to say this; I understand that this film was using Cecil&#8217;s position in the White House to chronicle the Black power movement and the change the country as a whole has undergone with regards to the treatment of African Americans, but that ending just felt&#8230;forced.  It took the film out of itself and gave it this air of trying way too hard, which is weird because up till that point I was convinced the film wasn&#8217;t really trying much at all.The ensemble is huge, but there are only a few actors who have a chance to make an impression, and even fewer who make a good one.  As I mentioned, Oyelowo is clearly the best in show here.  Cuba Gooding Jr. is hilarious, but is only there to make us laugh.  Oprah delivers a fine performance, but she oversells in key moments (that slap) and comes off like a Soap Opera actress.  Yaya Alafia is pretty good, but her final scenes (with the Black Panthers) are ill-played.  And then there is Whitaker, who is just there.I can&#8217;t recommend this.  It had promise, and the story told is one that is important, but there is so much going on here that nothing gets the proper treatment and the whole thing just feels like message film without a message.This would have worked better as a television mini-series.",2,One scene mistakes: or how Lee Daniels attained an eclectic cast and failed to do anything with it&#8230;,1389916800,"01 17,

The colors popped and were lifelike, and the detail strong.  The cinematography was excellent and from a movie making point of view, this was a very well done film, save for the presidents!  Now for the social-political reasons this film was made, that get's two thumbs down!Of course this film, it's subject matter and it's black gay director, always get more hype than normal.  That is because these slave themed films are put together for a new generation of blacks to learn what their place in this country should be.  Just keep in mind that these films are made and sponsored by the traditional heads in Hollywood and the black man's most relentless enemy!  Of course I cannot mention them here or I will be called anti-Jewish or something...If you noticed, Spike Lee and John Singleton are no longer promoted for their QUALITY, serious subject matter films from a black perspective, instead they are left by the wayside in favor of three homosexual, buffoon type black directors in Steve McQueen, Lee Daniels and Tyler Perry.  Whatever these guys come out with get's all of the hype, Singleton and Lee get no hype.  Of course Hollywood would never allow movies about the Moors ruling Spain, black Europe, ancient Egypt, BLACK Carthage, Black Israel, etc. to be made.  In other words, history as it was is a no-no, but more fiction and 'negro' films can keep coming!The Butler is one of the latest bunch of such 'negro' slave type films, along with Django, 12 Years a Slave and even the upcoming Roots remake (by you know who), all design to put both blacks and whites in a certain state of mind about blacks and to remind us all about where they prefer blacks to be.  &#34;The Butler,&#34; with it's title, imaging and storyline is a prime example of these movies.  Of course, Hollywood is slick enough to get &#34;negro&#34; gay directors like Lee Daniels who will do as told, as long as there are promises made to further along the gay cause and to set up a sick film about black gay love - Lee Daniels next film!Of course, this film was promoted as a biopic but it was 'loosely' based on the man's life, which anyone with a brain should have guessed, but anyone without a brain would get - brainwashed.  The Butler starts off in what appears to be slavery, but way after the fact, then he runs away, then he becomes a thief, then is raised by a master, in the arts of Uncle Tomming/butlery!  Many viewers act as if they failed to see and hear that the main character acknowledges being an Uncle Tom but refuses to be called that because his personal success (like all Toms) is more important than that of the group's (blacks).  It should be known that it was indeed mentioned throughout the film that he was an Uncle Tom.  However, this film's overall message was that blacks being Uncle Toms is a GOOD thing and being a black militant will get you put in jail, beat up or killed.The Butler is highly fictionalized and carries on the tradition of Hollywood reimgagining black history and whitewashing it with craziness, as if to make mockery of it or to poison the minds of newer generations and to revise American history.  All they have to do is to pay some fool, give him fame and fortune, hype him up as very talented and he will do whatever they ask!  However, when he is no longer of us, then he will find it hard to get a film out.  In this movie, there was no militant son, which they based his story on actual civil rights events, but if the son, Louis, had been real, THAT film should have been made, not this Uncle Tom/slave film.  Of course, heroics in favor of blacks thought was not the order, subservient blacks was the order.Forrest Whitaker did a great job - almost too great!  He seems to doe very well in these types of films for some reason.  Oprah Winfrey was actually pretty good, as she seems to only play in these 'down and out blacks' films, all while being very far from down and out, without helping any blacks do better while she has enough money and power to make some difference.  Oprah was good in her role and she was looking sexy too!  A woman her age should be looking worse now than what she did in her 20's and 30's, but Oprah can bring it over here and i'd deal with her!  These two, along with Cuba Gooding Jr. and Lenny Kravitz were the only good actors that I can recall.Now, they went through a few presidents starting with Truman, whom they portrayed as neutral to the black experience.  They skipped over Ike, but they did mention him.  They of course put emphasis on JFK, with a poor and SHORT actor portraying him - somewhat.  I did like the fact that they showed JFK for what he was - the ONLY president to proactively take on the plight of the black man!  That means that no one told him to do it, he just did what he knew to be right, he also paid the price for it.  I do like that they showed LBJ as the racist and uncouth person that he was, although the actor looked more like Spiro Agnew than LBJ!Nixon of course was a racist and at least the film showed his hatred of JFK and his resentment of the wealthy getting ENTITLEMENTS, even though he and his political career were sponsored, paid for and hooked up by the very wealthy Bush family - of Connecticut.  You can even make the valid case that the Bush family helped removed JFK in order to install their man Nixon, as well as their own into the White House.  They move on to Regan who the film made talk very slowly, I assume, to show is Parkinson's.  They also shows his racism as well, which was good in case people forgot.  Too bad they did not talk about Carter so we could see their analysis of him towards blacks.The presidents concludes with the Butler, being proud to see a 'black' man (who came out of a white woman no less!) be INSTALLED (not elected) as president, so he was invited for that.  The final scene of the film ends with a sick message of telling blacks (what Obama has said to blacks, but not to gays or illegals) that they need to &#34;do for self&#34; and to find their own way.  All of that after showing that blacks were systematically prevented from doing for self!  After over 30 years of butlering, the butler himself only realizes that he was an Uncle Tom after being served by the very butlers he worked with!  How can a man be proud to Tom only to have an epiphany about what he had do for so long?  Then he decides to join his living son's anti-apartheid protests at the risk of his job - a job that he protected with his life and stopped speaking to his son for what seem like 20 years!

1669047,A20NTWL30HBNYE,B00EV4EUT8,"Chris B ""Kuklapolitan""","[0, 0]","I am so glad a film such as this made the impact it did in today's world.  We are so used to seeing the bloody debacle of slavery and the civil rights movement  we sometimes forget that there was life between and after those times and it is that which we know so little of.  This film gives us an opportunity to witness life as seen through the eyes of a young boy going forward into manhood and old age from a place that is still almost frozen in time. The startling truth of the residual effects of slavery comes when we realize, that in the opening scenes, we are seeing life as it was in the 1920's!  This is when we see and realize that southern blacks, at the very least, were still very much their master's &#34;slaves&#34; and were still horribly oppressed and hard put. It is from this important vantage point do we enter the life of a young boy and follow, with him, through the ensuing years. It is this truth which sets us up for the mindset of a man that will travel through the many tumultuous years of this country as they pertained to the black man's experience in America. It is more than ironic that he became a butler in the White House under 8 distinctly different presidents during the many tumultuous years this film encompasses! The White House is used almost as a metaphor employed as a backdrop for the panoply of historical events through which his life passes and not about the White House itself! That must be understood or one will take a wrong turn and believe that something is missing!  While there are a few instances of interaction with sitting Presidents the overall story is one that does not at all depend on those interactions.  Not at all...this is about a man who happens to become a butler in the most revered place in the land but in reality, his life was no different than that of a well employed man working at any other job.  The thing that should give one pause is that even by employment at the White House, the seat of all American hope and the perpetual guardian of our Constitution, the history of this family was no different than any other and his experiences were really not much different than any other.  His wants or his needs were not met any differently than they would have been had he worked four blocks over and three to the right. His children experienced life as most other Black children did in and through their time.  White America and its feelings toward the Black man are more than evident when one contrasts the differences between White staff and Black.  Who was sitting in the Oval Office mattered very little and the problems are more than obvious. The story is an important one and Forrest Whittaker gives a beautifully controlled performance as the protagonist while Oprah Winfrey, as his wife, shows us the reality of the flip side of this strange little coin.

1669055,ACJVGDN8G386P,B00EV4EUT8,"classicalsteve ""classicalsteve""","[0, 1]","Although the American Civil War ended in 1865, civil injustice towards African-Americans continued to be an enduring aspect of American life, particularly in the South. Not until the Civil Rights legislation of 1964 was written into law about 100 years after the assassination of President Lincoln could the United States truly boast of being a country where all citizens were truly free or at least regarded as &#34;equal&#34; (more or less) by law. The United States for African-Americans was a very different place in 1920 than it became in 1970, a half-century later. This transformation is shown through the eyes and experiences of a butler for the White House, based on the life of Eugene Allen, who was a prominent butler at the US President's residence for 34 years. Allen lived from 1919 to 2008 and was one of the few people who lived long enough to see racial lynchings in the early 20th century and an African-American become president in 2008.Loosely based on Allen, Cecil Gaines, played by Forest Whitaker in a tour-de-force performance, grew up in the American South where he sees first-hand injustice and racial inequality. He works for a southern plantation and receives an opportunity to work inside the house, as a &#34;house n-----&#34;. His employment experiences eventually lead to a post at an exclusive club in Washington DC where he is spotted by someone who recruits for the hired help at the White House. He becomes a butler in the residence of the most powerful political figure of the United States. He has a wife, played by Oprah Winfrey, and two sons.As a parallel story, Gaines' son, Louis, played with equal vitality by David Oyelowo, becomes interested in the Civil Rights movement. While the elder Gaines is forced to steer clear of any kind of political posturing because of his role as a White House employee, his son participates in the demonstrations, sit-ins, the Freedom Riders, and even the Black Panthers. Because of his involvement, the relationship between father and son becomes strained. A large part of the story is not only about Gaines' employment at the White House but about Gaines the elder and Gaines the younger.On the other front, the elder Gaines learns about the eccentricities, the sensibilities, and even the political mind-sets of several presidents. Although he has been trained to stand in the midst of the president and other heads-of-state as if he is part of the furniture, Gaines cannot help but overhear the political goings-on at the White House. One of the remarkable aspects of Whitaker's performance is his ability to seem strangely detached from his surroundings, and yet through it all, he can't quite escape from having an opinion about his different employers. He is forced because of his employment obligations to resist offering his political opinions, and yet occasionally he is asked for his opinion by some of the presidents he served, which I would guess is probably quite accurate. (As a footnote, the fictional character and the real butler Allen, lived to see the election of Barack Obama in 2008.)&#34;The Butler&#34; is one of the best films to date of the 21st century. In addition to Whitaker's masterful performance, many other name actors are in this film, including Robin Williams in a surprisingly on-the-money portrayal of Dwight Eisenhower, John Cusack as Richard Nixon, Liev Schreiber as Lyndon Johnson, Alan Rickman as Ronald Reagan, and Jane Fonda as Nancy Reagan. Through it all, it's still Whitaker who takes all the way from racial segregation to Barack Obama.

I can only imagine the psychological strength it must take to keep one's self-control when you are confronted by so much evil, shallowness and contempt. Forget about politics for a moment, this film is the psychological study of a man who is the ultimate survivor! And if I was ever imprisoned someday in a Concentration camp this is the kind of man I would want to have in the bunk next to mine!In the very last scene there was a quite an ironic moment when out of all the Presidential tie clasps The Butler had to choose from he decides to wear LBJ's! President Johnson domestic agenda accomplished so much it defies comprehension: The passing of major civil rights bills, huge aid increases in education, the passage of Medicare and Medicaid, urban renewal programs, the Clean Air Act of 1963, the Wilderness Act, the Freedom of Information Act, the Public Architectural Barriers Act, the Public Broadcasting Act, beautification programs, development aid for depressed regions throughout the United States, a wide-scale fight against poverty and the removal of obstacles to the right to vote, in addition to the creation of the Head Start program and the Food Stamps program. Let us not forget the passage of the Gun Control Act (and he was from Texas, for God's Sake!) Under Johnson, NASA conducted the Gemini manned space program, developed the Saturn V rocket used by the Apollo and Skylab programs and made the first manned Apollo program flights. KEEP IN MIND JOHNSON PUSHED ALL THIS THOUGH CONGRESS IN LESS THAN 6 YEARS! I don't want to minimize the evil President Johnson did in Vietnam, but no President has done more for every American LIVING TODAY than LBJ and the Democratic Congress under his leadership! Every four years, I literally pray for a domestic policy version of LBJ to win the White House! To date, President Obama comes closest with his expansion of health care insurance and getting us through the greatest economic downturn since the Great Depression.For those conservatives who believe Ronald Reagan is ready for sainthood, he did more harm than good. Sure he was a nice guy, but I could care less about how nice he was. Even he admits he was on the wrong side of history! What more do you want? The irony is that by today's crazy Republican party standards Reagan would be considered a flaming liberal!The Butler is a synopsis of some of the most important moments in United States history witnessed by one incredibly brave man!

1669118,A1E6JS6C205VZD,B00EV4EUT8,Dr. Laurence Raw,"[151, 189]","THE BUTLER is a film which, for all its sentimental tone, nonetheless addresses the fundamental issue of civil rights, and whether the reforms of the Sixties have actually had the desired effect.  It centers on the life of Cecil Gaines (Forrest Whitaker), who grew up on a plantation but spent most of his career in service at the White House.  To his son Louis (David Oyelowo), Cecil is nothing more than a representative of &#34;Uncle Tom&#34; culture, spending his life in willing thrall to the white man.  On the other hand Cecil manages to provide for his family and carve out a career; it is only late on in his life, when President Ronald Reagan (Alan Rickman) offers him an opportunity to savor something that he has never previously experience, that he understands how little his masters have changed, ideologically speaking, since the days of racial segregation.  This is the film's &#34;aha-moment&#34; - from then on Gaines devotes himself to the cause of equal rights.  THE BUTLER brings out the ambiguities of the African American experience; how Gaines' life might be regarded as a form of &#34;liberation,&#34; despite working for a succession of white Presidents; and how the Civil Rights cause (as symbolized by the Black Panther movement of the Sixties and Seventies) might not have necessarily aided the African American experience.  The film contains a clutch of memorable performances: Oprah Winfrey is quite admirable as Gaines' wife Gloria, supported by Terrence Howard and Cuba Gooding Jr., in supporting roles.

1669125,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00EV4EUT8,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 11]","Director Lee Daniels is not one for subtlety in his filmmaking approach. Reminiscent of Douglas Sirk in his prime (All That Heaven Allows), he has an old-fashioned Baroque style full of melodramatic flourishes that work surprisingly well for an emotional powerhouse like 2009'sPrecious. A lot of that now-recognizable style is on display in this fictionalized 2013 historical drama, but it doesn't work quite as well when he is trying to give a history lesson of the civil rights movement through the eyes of a relatively recessive character like Cecil Gaines, a White House butler who survived seven Presidential administrations from Eisenhower to Reagan. Fortunately, Daniels cast Forest Whitaker as Gaines, and the actor responds with an intensely reflective performance that manages to capture the character's innate nobility and conflicting emotions. Gaines is based on a real-life White House butler, the late Eugene Allen, who actually started with Truman, but screenwriter Danny Strong (HBO'sGame Change) appears more intent in juxtaposing Gaines' insulated existence with the encroaching revolution embodied by the travails of his eldest son Louis.The film's timeline spans some eighty years starting with an eight-year-old Cecil working the Georgia cotton fields in 1926 when one day, he suddenly sees his mother taken to a cabin where she is raped by a disreputable white farmer and in turn, his father shot point-blank in the head for looking at the farmer in a questioning manner. The farmer's grandmother (a throwaway cameo from Vanessa Redgrave) brings Cecil into the house and has him trained as a servant, an experience that allows him to escape to North Carolina and then to Washington D.C. where he lands a job as a waiter at the exclusive Excelsior Hotel. Noticed by White House staffers, Gaines is hired as a butler in 1957 during the Eisenhower Administration. He proves to be ideal in his role as he silently does what is expected from him given ""there is no room for politics in the White House"". Gaines becomes a passive spectator to defining moments in the political and social landscape from the late-'50s until his retirement in the mid-80's when he plays a pivotal role in the black staff finally given equal pay and opportunity for advancement.Meanwhile, through it all, his saucy wife Gloria stands by him fighting alcoholism and the temptations of an amorous neighbor while struggling to connect with a son estranged by his father's subservient profession. In quick succession, Louis becomes a Freedom Rider, an aide to Martin Luther King, a Black Panther, a failed congressional candidate, an anti-apartheid activist and finally a Congressman. Despite a stalwart performance by David Oyelowo, he becomes something of a convenient plot device to personalize actual historical events such as the Greensboro sit-in at Woolworth's (a devastating montage) and King's assassination in Memphis. It brings aForrest Gump-like tone to the story that sometimes feels trivializing. Oprah Winfrey, on the other hand, infuses Gloria with so much of her larger-than-life persona that it is often difficult to see anyone but Oprah, yet she manages to retain credibility throughout and handles the movie's dramatic high points with aplomb. Daniels takes a similarly starry-eyed approach to his casting of the White House inhabitants, and the results are often distracting.Robin Williams is uncharacteristically restrained and consequently wasted as Eisenhower. Looking far more like Bobby than Jack, a too- youthful James Marsden trivializes Kennedy to the level of a prep-school student. Liev Schreiber is a blustery caricature as Johnson, while a prosthetically altered John Cusack manages to etch a thumbnail portrait of paranoia as Nixon. Alan Rickman looks strangely anesthetized as Reagan, but Jane Fonda places her authoritative stamp on Nancy in just one brief scene. The same cannot be said of Mariah Carey's brief and muted appearance early on as Gaines' catatonic mother. The framing device of a meeting with Obama (gratefully seen only in archival footage) brings the plot full circle with the elephantine point being made that Gaines was able to live to see the day when a black man could become President. Nonetheless, despite an emotional catharsis that lands with the impact of a sledgehammer and the multitude of stunt casting, the movie works on a basic emotional level because Daniels and Strong are so determined to use Gaines' life as the singular plot thread that brings all the landmark moments in the civil rights movement into dramatic focus.",4,The Reach of Daniels' Episodic History Lesson

Some of the script was very predictable. I knew when he said he was going to join the military what would happen to the younger son. I knew that the older son would survive.However, my biggest objections (as an Air Force Viet Nam era veteran--female if that makes a difference--and mainly as an American), is that the creators chose to cast Hanoi Jane, a traitor to our country, as Nancy Reagan. And this despite major objection when her casting was announced. What a slap in the face to Nancy Reagan and one of the most patriotic of our presidents. I did not realize that this was the movie she was cast in as the first lady. Had I known, I never would have watched it. The portrayal of Reagan's policy on civil rights was also inaccurately portrayed.  This website explains it better than I can.

1669159,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00EV4EUT8,Grady Harp,"[1, 2]","The duplicitous name of this film raises the question of the need to include the director's name in the film's title. Just as with LEE DANIELS' PRECIOUS, referring to this film as LEE DANIELS' THE BUTLER (when his successful films THE PAPER BOY and SHADOWBOXER did not bear is name on the marquee) makes the viewer question the concept of promoting the film. There likely is an answer to the question of why the name addition to the title, but that is another story.Likely most everyone has seen this film by now, now that the awards buzz have subsided and the film is available on television on demand so a summary of the film can be short: based on a `true story' in name, the film shares the life of one Cecil Gaines (Forrest Whitaker) from a Southern sharecropper's son who witnessed the racist murder of this father and the mind altering rape of his mother and fled the cotton fields to become a servant - first in hotels and subsequently as a White House butler for some thirty odd years. His family life with alcoholic wife Gloria (Oprah Winfrey) and two sons reflects the black struggles from the civil rights movement, the Black Panthers, the loss of a son in the Vietnam conflict, up to the crowning glory of the inauguration of a black President. The progress is captured in vignettes that while not always clearly defined, are heart wrenching.For some strange reason, perhaps out of respect for Daniels' courage in presenting American black history, the cast is brimming over with tiny bit parts that use famous actors: Vanessa Redgrave, Mariah Carey, Alex Pettyfer, Terrence Howard, Robin Williams, John Cusack, James Marsden, Live Schreiber, Alan Rickman, Jane Fonda, etc who rarely give the impression of the famous people they are enacting. The remainder of the large cast is good (David Oyelowo, Cuba Gooding, Jr., Lenny Kravitz, et al). But somehow despite the impact of watching the events in this country's finally coming to grips with human rights and racism, the film as a film feels shallow - all parade and no circus. And maybe that is because the racist issue remains incompletely resolved.

The first crack in this country's deeply engrained views on the place of afro-americans, then often called something else as a real term, is viewed in the family of lthe principal character--the butler. The Butler takes the path of improvement by way of more prestigious service; namely, The White House. He works within the system. His son just wants to be a regular U.S. citizen with equal rights.

It has an awful lot going for it. Although it is based loosely on the life of Eugene Allen, a butler for the White House from the presidency of Harry Truman to that of Ronald Reagan (from an article by Wil  Haygood of the ""Washington Post""), Director Lee Daniels (""Precious"") takes many liberties with the facts of Mr. Allen's life, something I have not a problem with as everything in every frame in this not-to-be-missed film actually took place in this country, whether it was the rape of a sharecropper's wife by a white man who then killed the sharecropper (I have a good friend who tells a similar story about his own grandfather in the rural South in the middle years of the 20th century) or the conflict between Cecil Gaines (Forest Whitaker) and his son Louis (David Oyelowo), who is a fictionalized character, or his other son who dies in Vietnam, which also did not happen to Mr. Allen's son.The acting of the three main characters Whitaker, Oyelowo and Oprah Winfrey as Gloria, Cecil Gaines' wife, is in a word superb (I had forgotten what a talented actress Ms. Winfrey is, not having seen her in a film since ""The Color Purple"" several years ago). Of course Allen/Gaines was a witness to the history of the civil rights movement in this country. (Gaines actually goes to the inauguration of  Mr. Obama, an event that actually happened  I believe as did the Allens being invited by Nancy Reagan to attend a state dinner.) Gaines' buddies, the other butlers in the White House, provide much comic relief in this very serious movie that probably won't be seen by those individuals who need to be reminded most about  how many white people treated  black people in much of the 20th century.My only complaint about the movie is that few of the actors who played the many presidents the butler worked for were very convincing to me. On the other hand, I found Jane Fonda as Nancy Reagan as she gushes about  her beloved ""Ronnie"" totally believable although she had the smallest of roles.I suspect the film is destined to become a classic.

Therefore, the director's name was added.Cecil Gaines (Forest Whitaker), now an old man, awaits inside The White House to meet President Barack Obama.  He thinks back to the time when he was 8 years old (Michael Rainey Jr). He was in the cotton field with his father, Earl (David Banner). The white owner of the plantation is Thomas Westfall (Alex Pettyfur). Thomas is a ruthless man and makes the black men work hard in the fields. Thomas takes Cecil's mother, Hattie (Mariah Carey) by the hand and into the shed. Cecil senses what is about to happen, but his father gets a hold of him and reminds him this is the white man's world and we are working in it. Cecil hears his mother scream.  Annabeth Westfall (Vanessa Redgrave) hears the screams too. Thomas walks out of the shed and into the field. Cecil asks his father what he is going to do. All the Earl says to Thomas is, ""Hey"", in a gentle voice. Thomas turns around, points a gun at Earl and shoots him dead. From then on, Annabeth makes Cecil work in the house as servant.When Cecil becomes a young man, he leaves the Westfall house to make a life for himself. He goes to his mother's home and says goodbye to her.In the city, he meets Maynard (Clarence Williams III). He works with Maynard as a butler. This later leads to an invitation for a job interview at The White House. Maynard feels he is old now and he doesn't want that job, so he gave Cecil's name a recognition instead.Cecil is given the job at The White House were he ultimately served for 7 Presidents of the United States in nearly 30 years (1957-1986) from President Dwight D.

And it reminds us that our current politics of 2013 are by no means the most divisive in recent history.This is meant to be a family movie, and while some of the vivid civil rights scenes are shocking, the brutality of the Civil Rights era was far worse. For example, no pictures of little kids being spat on, no teens blown up in churches. (Someday, someone will have the guts to do a real movie about the freedom riders and what it took to break the back of segregation, but it will be too violent and disturbing to get the ratings this movie has.)For the many boomers old enough to remember all these events first hand, it will be a fast-forward run through recent history, like reading a scrapbook. One vignette of this, a snapshot of that. It will make them feel great. For kids who didn't live through this, though, I wonder if this format will work. Will they even know who LBJ was, or why he'd be portrayed on a toilet? [A needless scene IMO].I gave this movie only three stars despite solid performances because it's too pat, too sanitized, everything is too much at arms length.  It's a good attempt at describing what happened in that time period, but it doesn't really explain why or how it happened. That requires great art.

Director Daniels (""Precious"") has once again evoked powerful performances from the entire cast, some of whom have worked with him before.Inspired by an article written by Wil Haygood about a real White House butler named Eugene Allen, this film creates a fictitious gentleman who, over three decades in the White House, serves as a butler to eight presidents. Had this been better explained, it would have avoided the controversy that followed the movie's release.This story encompasses a turbulent period in the history of the American Civil Rights Movement, but Danny Strong's Forrest Gumpish screenplay made me feel a bit manipulated as we went to Selma, Birmingham, Oakland, etc., etc., where we witnessed hide-your-eyes events that triggered (but ultimately advanced) the movement.We see:* Forest Whitaker (""The Last Stand"") is mesmerizing as Cecil Gaines who first becomes a butler for Dwight D. Eisenhower and continues his service into the Reagan Administration. Whitaker ages convincingly and is in top form for this year's Oscars.* Oprah Winfrey (""Ocean's Thirteen"") is his wife Gloria, who seems to be in chronic rivalry with her husband's prestigious job.* David Oyelowo (""Jack Reacher"") is their son Louis, who becomes increasingly radical, much to his parents' dismay.* Lenny Kravitz (""Precious"") is one of five other White House butlers who provide social commentary and humor.* Liev Schreiber (""Defiance"") steals the presidential show as Lyndon B. Johnson because LBJ's profane bombast is so theatrical.* Mariah Carey (""Precious"") is our hero's mother, raped, abused and ultimately mad.* Alan Rickman (""Galaxy Quest"" ...smile...) is Ronald Reagan, the fellow who listened to our hero and finally raised the salaries of the black staff to match those of the whites. Ronald and Nancy invite our hero and his wife to be guests at a White House dinner.There are far, far too many other fine actors to name, space doesn't permit me to identify all the players in this 132 minute outing. Be prepared to laugh at the generation gap as Gaines and his wife encounter changing attitudes, clothes and politics through their son. ""Black Power? What does that mean?"" and ""Shaneequa? What kind of a name is that?""This is rated PG-13, so expect horrifying examples of racism, but no sweaty bodies, very little gunfire, and no blowie uppie stuff, but the ""N"" word is used repeatedly and the police dogs are scary.

What gave this film some legs was his performance and the moving relationship the fictional Mr. Gaines had with his sons and wife. Mainly, the scenes with his older son who, we are led to believe, not only became a Freedom Rider, but a Black Panther and Mandela advocate in the ensuing decades. All this had some weight and believability--but the lunch counter scenes where a group of random crackers spitting, humiliating, the good, noble protesters was a bit much for me. In such cases, the cops would have been called in immediately. But like Mr. McQueen in his TWELVE YEARS A SLAVE (which is a far better film)--it's almost with a perverse delight to have these scenes of just how sadistic Whitie was to the good, noble, Black man taken to its fullest extreme.The opening scene, where I really did not know which century I was in, where a ""Plantation"" owner rapes the good, noble, Mullotto mother of the butler character, and then kills his father for no reason was really way over the top. 1930's Georgia? I don't think so. More like 1830's. And if such a thing occurred, the sadistic Whitie would have gone to jail. Sorry, but it was insult to my intelligence.What became amusing, though, were the ridiculous scenes with all of these presidents. Just as Mr. Gaines enters the Oval Office, take your pick president, is discussing some aspect of civil rights.

I believe there are synchronistic occurrences in the universe that have no business being in such coordinated juxtaposition as to appear to be crafted or contrived. I believe that the billions of humans running around with hopes, dreams, fears, and desires - all emanating those emotions into the universe like a siren song to be returned by the laws of attraction - create what can only be described by a disconnected observer as chaos.But this movie, based on the true story and life of Cecil Gaines, who served as a butler in the White House for eight presidents, will leave you pondering more questions of your own perception of coincidence and chaos. This man's past, and his path that led to the open door of serving in the white house, and his eventual influence on the decisions of presidents, really makes you see that there are greater forces at work than we can comprehend.Forrest Whitaker - what can I say the man is an acting genious. A legend. There isn't anything I've ever seen him in that I didn't love his acting. Oprah, well I think Oprah is misunderstood and underrated. She is a perfect example of why a person should do one thing and do it excellently, or risk confusing everybody. This woman could be a talk show host and do nothing else and be great. She can be an actress and do nothing else and be great. When I see her in a great acting role, I think ""why does she do a talk show"" and when I see her on her talk show (which I realize doesn't exist anymore) I wonder the opposite.But enough of my diatribe about these great actors. The movie is really excellent, worth watching, and will, if nothing else, make you realize that people who are always pining for ""the good old days"" should go read a history book.

The only part of the film that was true was that the original real life character, Eugene Allen, served in the White House staff under 8 Presidents starting with Harry Truman.  The film itself was good and well acted by Forest Whitaker and Oprah Winfrey.This was actually a good movie that goes out of the way to present the story line in a skewed manner to make the facts as dramatic as possible.  While the reality of racism is presented in the film and many of the things that occurred are realistic and true, they had nothing to do with the story of Eugene Allen.  The story line differs from the book as the book does not cover the rape of the young man's mother nor the murder of his father in a cotton field.  Those facts did not happen.  The film also made his wife of 64 years out to be an adulterous woman and an alcoholic.The movie goes on to slander Ronald Reagan as a racist while nothing in the history books or the testimony of the people that worked with Mr. Reagan ever showed any of the tendencies that the movie brings forth.  History is skewed in an effort for Hollywood to dramatize the race relations issues by portraying a fictitious story as a true story.  The real butler in the real life only had one son and not two and that son was not a political activist on racial issues as presented in the film while he did serve in Vietnam and he returned alive and well.While this is a good story and the problems of racism in our country need to be told, they should be told without political spin or Hollywood's rewriting of history.  This movie was about a story of a black man that served 8 Presidents and saw a dramatic change in this country's attitude towards racism and the treatment of other people.  That in and of itself would have been a great film without all of the added garbage that improperly depicted the life of Eugene Allen and others in the historical record.I give the film three stars, one for Forest Whitaker, one for Oprah Winfrey and one for Eugene Allen, The Butler.",3,Based on a true story that was twisted for political and dramatic impact!,1396656000,"04 5, 2014",2014,2117,"['do', ""n't"", 'like', 'films', 'proclaim', 'be', 'true', 'story', 'then', 'present', 'story', 'fictional', 'happenings', 'only', 'part', 'film', 'was', 'true', 'was', 'original', 'real', 'life', 'character', 'Eugene', 'Allen', 'served', 'White', 'House', 'staff', '8', 'Presidents', 'starting', 'Harry', 'Truman', 'film', 'was', 'good', 'well', 'acted', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'Oprah', 'Winfrey.This', 'was', 'actually', 'good', 'movie', 'way', 'present', 'story', 'line', 'skewed', 'manner', 'make', 'facts', 'as', 'dramatic', 'possible', 'reality', 'racism', 'presented', 'film', 'many', 'things', 'occurred', 'are', 'realistic', 'true', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'story', 'Eugene', 'Allen', 'story', 'line', 'differs', 'book', 'book', 'not', 'cover', 'rape', 'young', 'man', 'mother', 'murder', 'father', 'cotton', 'field', 'facts', 'did', 'not', 'happen', 'film', 'also', 'made', 'wife', '64', 'years', 'be', 'adulterous', 'woman', 'alcoholic.The', 'movie', 'slander', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'racist', 'nothing', 'history', 'books', 'testimony', 'people', 'worked', 'Mr.', 'Reagan', 'ever', 'showed', 'tendencies', 'movie', 'forth', 'History', 'skewed', 'effort', 'Hollywood', 'dramatize', 'race', 'relations', 'issues', 'portraying', 'fictitious', 'story', 'true', 'story', 'real', 'butler', 'real', 'life', 'only', 'had', 'one', 'son', 'not', 'two', 'son', 'was', 'not', 'political', 'activist', 'racial', 'issues', 'presented', 'film', 'did', 'serve', 'Vietnam', 'returned', 'alive', 'well.While', 'good', 'story', 'problems', 'racism', 'country', 'need', 'be', 'told', 'should', 'be', 'told', 'political', 'spin', 'Hollywood', 'rewriting', 'history', 'movie', 'was', 'story', 'black', 'man', 'served', '8', 'Presidents', 'saw', 'dramatic', 'change', 'country', 'attitude', 'towards', 'racism', 'treatment', 'other', 'people', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'film', 'added', 'garbage', 'improperly', 'depicted', 'life', 'Eugene', 'Allen', 'others', 'historical', 'record.I', 'give', 'film', 'three', 'stars', 'one', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'one', 'Oprah', 'Winfrey', 'one', 'Eugene', 'Allen', 'Butler']",N/A

Can you imagine Oprah smoking in real life?! But you can easily imagine, as I did, where the influence for this portrayal of a famous person smoking cigarettes came from --- the tobacco industry.

1669232,A356HRZZFCEGL1,B00EV4EUT8,"John Panagopoulos ""John Andrew Panagopoulos""","[8, 17]","***This review may contain spoilers.***Ed Uyeshima's review of ""Lee Daniels The Butler"" (hereafter ""The Butler"") pretty much encompasses and captures my feelings toward this ambitiously sweeping movie. What more can I add? In this review I will focus upon the need to sustain Civil Rights/Equality history's relevance and the need to represent something greater than you.Through the passive but observant eyes of partly-fictionalized eyes of Cecil Gaines (Forest Whitaker), the viewer is barraged with practically every notable American Civil Rights, Affirmative Action, and Equality event from the late thirties to the near present. Some events are sketchy and ephemeral, others more shockingly substantial. Some events are uplifting and optimistic, others are shameful and appalling. Like Cecil to some extent, we sympathize and empathize with the players in these historical dramas, but also wish to be distanced from it because it threatens our family, our livelihood, and even our lives. Cecil, at least as a small boy, wants to fight the injustices African-American endure, but his life's training as a servant has suppressed all that. To survive and even prosper, Cecil has internalized the old adage ""Keep your head down, and you'll work forever"". As a result, he has a ""prestigious"" job as a White House butler and a comfortable home in a predominantly black (and therefore safe) D.C. suburb.However, comfort zones (especially in the movies) don't last long. Cecil's older son Louis (David Oyelowo) is diametrically opposed to being like father. Improbably but admirably, Louis becomes involved in practically every revolutionary Civil Rights event, including Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s 1963 march on Washington and the formation of the Black Panthers. To his father's fearful dismay, Louis's militant activities take precedence over his Fisk University studies and even his career. At a family dinner, when Louis condemns Sidney Poitier's ""Uncle Tom"" vanilla appeasement of whites, that ignites a confrontation with his father. However, ""The Butler"" makes blindingly clear that it isn't Louis who has alter his thinking. Cecil has to find it within himself to radically alter years of subservient conditioning and take a stand, not only for Civil Rights/Equality, but also for his own self-respect. He begins by arguing with the White House serving head for equal pay for equal work, and works up to dinner as a guest of the Reagans. As he approaches old age, Cecil is fortunate enough to see Obama's election to the presidency and get a formal White House invitation from him. ""The Butler"", I think, also states that taking a stand for bettering the human condition does not have to begin on a dramatic, monumental scale. Quietly but determinedly working for incremental change is also courageous and vital.""The Butler"" frequently presents a whirlwind synopsis of American Civil rights history with the subtlety of a charging rhinoceros. Some viewers may balk at that and, especially in light of the 50th anniversary of Dr. King's ""I Have a Dream"" oration, uncomfortably dismiss it as restive propaganda. Yet, we have to remember to remember history, otherwise... well, you know. We need to be reminded of American Civil Rights' tortured, violent, but progressive history and the ignorant hatred of intolerant people. We need to be reminded that we have come a long way, but that we have a long way to go, and perhaps always will. Nevertheless, when you fight for justice, the very fight is a triumph. The only way to lose is when you stop fighting.",4,"Through a Civil Rights and Equality Prism, ""Lee Daniels's The Butler"" Reminds Us to Never Forget, and to Take a Stand",1382918400,"10 28, 2013",2013,3562,"['***This', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***Ed', 'Uyeshima', 'review', 'Lee', 'Daniels', 'Butler', 'hereafter', 'Butler', 'pretty', 'much', 'encompasses', 'captures', 'feelings', 'ambitiously', 'sweeping', 'movie', 'What', 'more', 'can', 'add', 'review', 'will', 'focus', 'need', 'sustain', 'Civil', 'Rights/Equality', 'history', 'relevance', 'need', 'represent', 'something', 'greater', 'passive', 'observant', 'eyes', 'partly-fictionalized', 'eyes', 'Cecil', 'Gaines', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'viewer', 'barraged', 'practically', 'notable', 'American', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'Affirmative', 'Action', 'Equality', 'event', 'late', 'thirties', 'near', 'present', 'events', 'are', 'sketchy', 'ephemeral', 'others', 'more', 'shockingly', 'substantial', 'events', 'are', 'uplifting', 'optimistic', 'others', 'are', 'shameful', 'appalling', 'Cecil', 'extent', 'sympathize', 'empathize', 'players', 'historical', 'dramas', 'also', 'wish', 'be', 'distanced', 'family', 'livelihood', 'even', 'lives', 'Cecil', 'least', 'small', 'boy', 'fight', 'injustices', 'African-American', 'endure', 'life', 'training', 'servant', 'suppressed', 'survive', 'even', 'prosper', 'Cecil', 'internalized', 'old', 'adage', 'Keep', 'head', 'down', ""'ll"", 'work', 'forever', 'result', 'prestigious', 'job', 'White', 'House', 'butler', 'comfortable', 'home', 'predominantly', 'black', 'therefore', 'safe', 'D.C.', 'suburb.However', 'comfort', 'zones', 'especially', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'last', 'long', 'Cecil', 'older', 'son', 'Louis', 'David', 'Oyelowo', 'diametrically', 'opposed', 'being', 'father', 'Improbably', 'admirably', 'Louis', 'involved', 'practically', 'revolutionary', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'event', 'including', 'Dr.', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'King', 'Jr.', '1963', 'march', 'Washington', 'formation', 'Black', 'Panthers', 'father', 'fearful', 'dismay', 'Louis', 'militant', 'activities', 'take', 'precedence', 'Fisk', 'University', 'studies', 'even', 'career', 'family', 'dinner', 'when', 'Louis', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'Uncle', 'Tom', 'vanilla', 'appeasement', 'whites', 'confrontation', 'father', 'However', 'Butler', 'blindingly', 'clear', ""n't"", 'Louis', 'who', 'alter', 'thinking', 'Cecil', 'find', 'radically', 'alter', 'years', 'subservient', 'conditioning', 'take', 'stand', 'not', 'only', 'Civil', 'Rights/Equality', 'also', 'own', 'self-respect', 'arguing', 'White', 'House', 'serving', 'head', 'equal', 'pay', 'equal', 'work', 'up', 'dinner', 'guest', 'Reagans', 'old', 'age', 'Cecil', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'see', 'Obama', 'election', 'presidency', 'get', 'formal', 'White', 'House', 'invitation', 'Butler', 'think', 'also', 'taking', 'stand', 'bettering', 'human', 'condition', 'not', 'have', 'begin', 'dramatic', 'monumental', 'scale', 'Quietly', 'determinedly', 'working', 'incremental', 'change', 'also', 'courageous', 'vital', 'Butler', 'frequently', 'whirlwind', 'synopsis', 'American', 'Civil', 'rights', 'history', 'subtlety', 'charging', 'rhinoceros', 'viewers', 'may', 'balk', 'especially', 'light', '50th', 'anniversary', 'Dr.', 'King', 'Have', 'Dream', 'oration', 'uncomfortably', 'dismiss', 'restive', 'propaganda', 'have', 'remember', 'remember', 'history', 'otherwise', 'well', 'know', 'need', 'be', 'reminded', 'American', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'tortured', 'violent', 'progressive', 'history', 'ignorant', 'hatred', 'intolerant', 'people', 'need', 'be', 'reminded', 'have', 'come', 'long', 'way', 'have', 'long', 'way', 'go', 'perhaps', 'always', 'will', 'Nevertheless', 'when', 'fight', 'justice', 'very', 'fight', 'triumph', 'only', 'way', 'lose', 'when', 'stop', 'fighting']",N/A

1669234,ABUGC6184LYR9,B00EV4EUT8,Joseph Ryan,"[0, 0]","My wife and I saw The Butler in a theater in August and found it thrilling, as well as sentimental and impressive: impressive for the actors' performances, obviously sentimental, and thrilling because it pulled few punches regarding nearly contemporary U.S. history.  We saw all nine movies nominated for the Best Movie Oscar: a couple are remarkable but The Butler remains the major movie experience of 2013 for us.Given that it also had a lot of Oscar buzz at the time, we were puzzled later when it was shut out of the Oscar nominations.  Casting about for a theory, the best we heard was that the Academy was reluctant to vote for Oprah due to some sense of rivalry.  This is pretty weak, I know, but we can't quite make ourselves believe that The Butler was not nominated because it was released before October.Reading Amazon reviews (over 1,300 now) has helped me understand the ""Oscar snub"" a bit better.  There seem to be two issues.The smaller issue is that The Butler is pro-Obama.  I wouldn't want to under-play this angle, as (if I read the news right) 11% of the U.S. public have told pollsters that they believe Obama is the Anti-Christ.  And even if I can't quite wrap my head around that, I know that The Butler's having Jane Fonda play Nancy Reagan is going to be a bit much for quite a few people.  So given everything that The Butler put on the screen, it's clearly going to raise a lot fewer hackles to vote for period pieces like Twelve Years a Slave, safely tucked away six generations ago.Still, I'm forced to conclude from the reviews that The Butler's real issue is that it bores people.I can see that it has a low sex-and-violence rating: indeed, I think I remember at one point a man dancing with his own wife.  Beyond that, however, consider the idea of portraying Dwight Eisenhower on the screen.  Now to me it's somewhat daring, since if Eisenhower spoke and acted as President now the way he did then, his Anti-Christ rating would probably make it into the 7 to 9 percent range anyway.  But in a world where cinematic greatness depends on repeat viewings by 14-year-olds, it's more likely a formula for ratings oblivion.Let's take Gravity, by way of contrast.  Kinetically, it's apparently the greatest IMAX feature ever.  And on top of this, it reinforces grade-school patriotism while reassuring viewers that women really are emotional beings who become hysterical under pressure and need to be rescued (repeatedly) by good-ol' boys, represented in Gravity by a character so authentically American that his presence in a scene (even if only in spirit) makes country-western music resonate spontaneously in the vacuum of outer space.  The votes are in, and The Butler can't compete with that.So I suppose the studio projects about sundown towns will have gone back on the shelf and The Butler may only retain a niche audience.",5,Still Too Soon,1395446400,"03 22, 2014",2014,2858,"['wife', 'saw', 'Butler', 'theater', 'August', 'found', 'thrilling', 'as', 'well', 'sentimental', 'impressive', 'impressive', 'actors', 'performances', 'obviously', 'sentimental', 'thrilling', 'pulled', 'few', 'punches', 'regarding', 'nearly', 'contemporary', 'U.S.', 'history', 'saw', 'nine', 'movies', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Movie', 'Oscar', 'couple', 'are', 'remarkable', 'Butler', 'major', 'movie', 'experience', '2013', 'us.Given', 'also', 'had', 'lot', 'Oscar', 'buzz', 'time', 'were', 'puzzled', 'later', 'when', 'was', 'shut', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'Casting', 'theory', 'best', 'heard', 'was', 'Academy', 'was', 'reluctant', 'vote', 'Oprah', 'due', 'sense', 'rivalry', 'pretty', 'weak', 'know', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'make', 'ourselves', 'believe', 'Butler', 'was', 'not', 'nominated', 'was', 'released', 'October.Reading', 'Amazon', 'reviews', '1,300', 'now', 'helped', 'understand', 'Oscar', 'snub', 'bit', 'better', 'seem', 'be', 'two', 'issues.The', 'smaller', 'issue', 'Butler', 'pro-Obama', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'under-play', 'angle', 'read', 'news', 'right', '11', '%', 'U.S.', 'public', 'have', 'told', 'pollsters', 'believe', 'Obama', 'Anti-Christ', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'wrap', 'head', 'know', 'Butler', 'having', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'play', 'Nancy', 'Reagan', 'going', 'be', 'bit', 'much', 'quite', 'few', 'people', 'So', 'given', 'everything', 'Butler', 'put', 'screen', 'clearly', 'going', 'raise', 'lot', 'fewer', 'hackles', 'vote', 'period', 'pieces', 'Twelve', 'Slave', 'safely', 'tucked', 'away', 'six', 'generations', ""'m"", 'forced', 'conclude', 'reviews', 'Butler', 'real', 'issue', 'people.I', 'can', 'see', 'low', 'sex-and-violence', 'rating', 'indeed', 'think', 'remember', 'one', 'point', 'man', 'dancing', 'own', 'wife', 'Beyond', 'however', 'consider', 'idea', 'portraying', 'Dwight', 'Eisenhower', 'screen', 'Now', 'somewhat', 'daring', 'Eisenhower', 'spoke', 'acted', 'President', 'now', 'way', 'did', 'then', 'Anti-Christ', 'rating', 'would', 'probably', 'make', '7', '9', 'percent', 'range', 'anyway', 'world', 'where', 'cinematic', 'greatness', 'repeat', 'viewings', '14-year-olds', 'more', 'likely', 'formula', 'ratings', 'oblivion.Let', 'take', 'Gravity', 'way', 'contrast', 'Kinetically', 'apparently', 'greatest', 'IMAX', 'feature', 'ever', 'top', 'grade-school', 'patriotism', 'reassuring', 'viewers', 'women', 'really', 'are', 'emotional', 'beings', 'who', 'become', 'hysterical', 'pressure', 'need', 'be', 'rescued', 'repeatedly', 'good-ol', 'boys', 'represented', 'Gravity', 'character', 'so', 'authentically', 'American', 'presence', 'scene', 'even', 'only', 'spirit', 'country-western', 'music', 'resonate', 'spontaneously', 'vacuum', 'outer', 'space', 'votes', 'are', 'Butler', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compete', 'that.So', 'suppose', 'studio', 'projects', 'sundown', 'towns', 'will', 'have', 'gone', 'back', 'shelf', 'Butler', 'may', 'only', 'retain', 'niche', 'audience']",N/A

Two, he assembled the most brilliant, talented, enlightened and heartwarming cast of `Hollywood Gold' he could find. And three, directed the film, cast, crew and story with such subtly of warmth, compassion and bitter reality of what was the highs and lows of the Negro segregation issues were and then became over a 70 year time period from the streets of America to the inside view from the White House itself.I'm only going to highlight the most stunning performances of this over 30 membered star-studded cast, although there wasn't a single bad performance by anyone in this film. Forest Whitacker (Platoon, The Last King of Scotland) plays the leading role Cecil Gaines, as the butler who served in the White House for over 60 years. His passion and dilemmas with the oppression of the Negro race has seen many supporters and non-supporters both in the nation's streets and in office as our presidents. Some were sympathetic to him like James Marsden (X-Men, Hairspray) playing John F. Kenny and other were not as accepting like Alan Rickman (Harry Potter, Die Hard) playing Ronald Reagan.Oprah Winfrey (The Color Purple) choses her roles based on the quality of the character and she hit a `gold mine' with Gloria Gaines, Cecil's wife and mother of two very different children heading in two very different directions in a time when a nation did not respect their own citizens based on the color of their skins. Oprah's passion for her two children, Earl Gaines played brilliantly by David Banner (The Ropes, street Kings) and Charlie Gaines played so sympathetically by Elijah Kelly (Hairspray, Dirty Sexy Money) was so compassionate you completely understand this mothers concerns and fears and her eventually downfall with alcohol. Yet, her love overcomes all.Cuba Gooding, Jr. (Jerry McGuire, As Good As It Gets) plays a new best friend to Forest in the White House and does a heartfelt amazing realization of what Cecil has to deal with at home and in the Oval Office.The presidents were amazingly portrayed by Robin Williams (Good Morning Vietnam, Good Will Hunting) as Dwight D. Eisenhower, John Cusak (2012, Being John Malkovich) as Richard M. Nixon, Liev Schrieber as Lyndon B. Johnson and other White House icons like Minka Kelly (500 Days Of Summer, Just Go With It) as Jacqueline Kenny, Nelson Ellis (True Blood, The Inside)as Martin Luther King, Vanessa Redgrave (Howard's end, Mission: Impossile)as slave owner Annabeth Westfall, Mariah Carey (Precious) as family friend Hattie Pearl and Jane Fonda (The China Syndrome, On Golden Pond) as Nancy Reagan. They all looked, acted and even sounded exactly like what you would expect them to. It was amazing.This film should not only be nominated, but as far as all the films out there so far this year, it should win all the awards in all the categories it could possibly  be nominated for/in; Including Cinematography by Andrew Dunn (Hitch, Crazy Stupid Love), Costume Design by Ruth E. Carter (Serenity, Malcolm X), musical score by Rodrigo Leao (Ecuador) and the entire make-up department for the film for the wonderful transformations of some of our favorite actors into real historical figures of the past.Take the entire family for a strong, emotionally riveting historical journey through American history of the Negro (Afro American) struggle to attain their supposedly ""God-Given rights"" as citizens of this nation. You will laugh, you will be angered, you will be disgusted, you will be shocked, you will be ashamed and you will cry - both happy tears and sad tears. And remember, there are still races, classes, genders and preferences over 230 years later, still fighting to be treated equal! Thanks to films like this, American might look as civil rights and discrimination still trying to thrive like and unforgiving weed all around us.

1669289,A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ,B00EV4EUT8,"L. Power ""nlp trainer""","[8, 14]","I love Oprah as much as reason allows, and that, favorable pre-movie buzz, and Oscar talk propelled me to see this movie. In fact I looked forward to it with some anticipation.The beginning stated that the movie was inspired by a true story.  If there was one thing I would change about the movie it would be that statement, as some of the more significant story elements used in this movie are in fact not true.  That is not to diminish the story in any way as entertainment, but to depict something as a true story, and then foist a not true narrative on the spectator does not bode well for the movies Oscar aspirations, though it has not hurt it at the box office.With the well deserved success of the superior movie  'The Help,' from last year, the writers of this movie were obviously hoping to get similar acclaim for this movie.The movie opens in a deep south plantation cotton field in 1926, and a young black boy watches as the plantation owners son grabs the boys mother (played by Mariah Carey) and pulls her into the barn, where we can deduce what happens.  When the owner emerges what happens next is fiction.  The landowners mother or aunt, played by Vanessa Redgrave perhaps moved by pity, or guilt, then trains the boy to be a house slave, I mean servant.  When the boy grows up, he leaves the plantation, and filled with determination to make a better life for himself than his parents somehow becomes the White house butler.Except in reality the inciting event did not happen.What I did like about the movie is that it was well made, and has a stellar cast.  Several performances are worth talking about, particularly Forest Whitaker as The Butler, who may win an Oscar nomination, and I particularly liked James Marsden's take on John F Kennedy.  John Cusack gave an interesting though unlikely performance as Nixon.  Lenny Kravitz is also a pleasant surprise.In fact, as entertainment, it is quite good.  A few tv commentators have talked up Oprah's performance. Oprah has her moments in this movie, though I thought she was better in both Beloved, and The color Purple. Here she plays the Butler's alcoholic wife, who may not or may not be having an affair with the character played by Terence Brady.  A scene where she danced along to the telly was subtle and amusing, and a scene where she  puts on lipstick in front of the mirror while arguing with her husband and about to go to bed I found to be messed up but arresting.  Who puts on lipstick to go to bed?  What about the laundry bills?As a scene where a character criticized Sidney Poitier unfolded I found myself wondering what would Oprah do.  This was a great scene.One of the more surprising elements of the story, apparently true, was that despite all the Civil Rights laws passed in the 1960s, black Butlers still had less pay and opportunity for advancement than their white counterparts, although we do not see any white butlers in the movie. It's really curious that the Kennedys would not do anything about it, or Nixon though in the movie he makes a campaign promise to the butlers to that effect.  It's not until Reagan becomes President that that is resolved, although Reagan's son takes issue with how his father is depicted in the movie on other matters.So the movie has attracted some controversy, yet has done very well at box office.  As I write it has grossed over $102 million in 5 weeks of release having spent three weekends at number one.  So it's success is assured.

""Avid reader, history buff, mom, pro...","[1, 1]","In the last six months three movies have moved me to change and open my heart on race, society, and gender. 'The Butler' is the third, after 'Twelve Years a Slave' and 'Belle'. Perhaps no-one else would/will be affected in the same way. Some may think my reaction shallow. But this story, fictionalized as it is, drew laughter, smiles, tears, outrage, pain - Cecil Gaines is the lens through which we witness the massive societal shifts that reshaped society over the last 60 years.  It's an uncompromising lens. For example, Martin Luther King's over-voice saying 'the black domestic defy racial stereotypes' by being hard working... He slowly tears down racial hatred... in many ways they are subversive' while we see Cecil and the White House staff working in a White House where they are paid less, called ni**er, where the goal is that a room should feel empty when they are in it. Pain? Outrage? Hope? There is no word for the mix of all three, and more, that this movie evokes over and over again.At times the Gaines' home-life feels like my own childhood in the sixties - then all hell breaks loose at the homecoming dinner table. The tension is society's tension, generational tension, family tension, church tension. Heartbreak, conflict, hope - over and over in scene and dialogue skillfully set against one another, history plays out.  Presidents, Cecil, his family, the news...This is not a light movie, but it is a must-see. If you lived through this time, it may break open your memories. If you only know this era through history and others, it can open your heart. Where do we go from here? The Gaines' family pain made me wonder about healing the wounds of race, of generations, of the 'isms' that continue to wound and divide. Yes, this is a fictionalized account of the life of Eugene Allen. I've read Michael Reagan's outraged critique of 'The Butler', and find it overdone. It doesn't make the Reagans look weak or vicious in Reagan's pondering and self-doubt on race. The movie included Nancy, played by Jane Fonda, bossing staffers around for 'Ronnie's' sake. Fonda comes off a snarky and arrogant, but this is Jane playing Nancy - I don't think she could  help it. Kristin Chenoweth would have been excellent in the roll. What was included about the Reagans speaks volumns: Cecil (as was Eugene Allan) is invited to be a guest at a state dinner. The movie massages this, and then -spoiler- has Cecil resigning over Reagan's decision to veto the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act. Doesn't feel like a slam at Reagan, who was very much shaped by his generational anti-Communist worldview.  It marks a turning point Cecil's attitudes and his growth, from his virulent opposition to his son's Civil Rights activity, rooted in his upbringing, his generational attitudes and experiences - and he movement beyond them. It marks the beginning of Cecil's reconciliation to his son, and of Louis to his father.The last scenes are poignant -bit of a spoiler, if you haven't seen it-  Cecil, now old and basking in the candidacy of Barack Obama, is fretting that his son hasn't been on time to pick them up for church since he'd been elected to congress. Gloria is fretting over their granddaughter. There is a powerful hope in the homey fretting and affectionate banter about grandchildren and life. Can we move beyond the chains and pains of the past, even live into brutal honesty and repentance and forgiveness into something like healing, as individuals and as a society? Yes, we can.

This movie showed beautifully the generational fights of father/son. The 'butler' had all the faith that the 'good white men'  showed understanding and true love for the humans struggling to survive while only wanting equal treatment, while on the other hand the son was a bit more radical which caused conflict between father/son and decades of estrangement.The reviewers who had no personal first-hand experience with segregation, separate water fountains, bathrooms, seating arrangements, integration, riots (on and on and on) probably should stop nit-picking about what is inaccurate about this movie and concentrate more on what actually happened in the early 1960's (and before). Nobody knows what goes on behind closed doors (until it is no longer secret information), but there is absolutely no denial of what is/was witnessed.Having said that, Forest Whitaker has been a favorite since Good Morning Vietnam, but Oprah just really could not pull off the role she attempted to play, probably from way too much overexposure.

1669314,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B00EV4EUT8,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[8, 18]","4 1/2 starsThe Butler (aka Lee Daniel's The Butler) is an emotional, powerful film based on the story of a real life butler who worked at The White House; the film deals primarily with the civil rights movement as it influences the life of an African-American youth who grows up to be a butler employed at The White House. The relationship between the subservient African-American butler who must never speak his mind nor react to whatever is being said by very powerful white people highlights the deplorably low status in society that African-Americans endured especially during the time the butler, named Cecil Gaines in this film, was employed at The White House. In addition, the effects of both Vietnam and American politics in general are well explored as experienced by Cecil and his family. However, while that is all well done, and the performances in this film are tremendously good and poignant, the storyline itself is a bit choppy--for example, the earlier years of the butler's (Cecil's) working at The White House are explored in greater detail and length than the later years--President Ford's administration is dealt with for barely more than 15 seconds as we see a clip of him talking on the television as President and President Carter doesn't get too much time in this film, either. There's still more to the plot but I'll leave some out so you can watch and appreciate this film as much as I did.I also give the filmmakers and the others who worked on this film a tremendous amount of credit for making this all come alive--for example, the makeup was so convincing I could completely believe that people like Cecil are aging as the movie progresses! The sets are very well done and the choreography and cinematography both shine. The musical score, while not too extensive since this is certainly no musical, enhances the film as well making it all the more powerful and memorable.Again, however, it is the story of an African-American man and his quest for at least a half-way decent life (or at least survival) for himself and his family in a world in which the white man dominated the black man that truly captivated me. The plot is full of poignant moments that brought tears of sadness to my eyes: we see the butler (Cecil Gaines played with panache by Forest Whitaker) so broken and scarred by the horrific violence he witnessed in his youth that when his son Louis (David Oyelowo) wants to join the Freedom Riders he promptly and angrily dismisses the movement as futile; Cecil also forbids Louis to even just attend a civil rights rally held in the late 1950s when the family is already living in Washington, D.C. and supposedly (but of course not really) treated noticeably better than African-Americans were treated in the South. Oprah Winfrey's portrayal of Cecil's wife Gloria with her strengths and inner demons also stunned me with its raw power; Oprah's ability to make Gloria come to real life on that screen is remarkable. Adriane Lenox as Gina and Pernell Walker as Lorraine astounded me with their exceptionally convincing performances that I won't forget anytime soon.There are, as many others have noted, quite a few big name stars who lend their presence to the film and make it even more powerful. Look for Mariah Carey as Hattie Pearl, Cecil's mother; Vanessa Redgrave as Annabeth Westfall; Robin Williams as Dwight D. Eisenhower; John Cusack as Richard Nixon; James Marsden as John F. Kennedy; Liev Schreiber as Lyndon B. Johnson; Alan Rickman and Jane Fonda as Ronald and Nancy Reagan; Clarence Williams III as Maynard; Jim Gleason as R.D. Warner; Cuba Gooding Jr. as Carter Wilson; Lenny Kravitz as James Holloway and Minka Kelly as Jacqueline Kennedy.Overall, The Butler will remain one of the better films of 2013 and I highly recommend it for people interested in racial issues and the history of our country's long and rocky struggle to become a society in which everyone is truly equal. In addition, people who appreciate dramas, especially dramas based on real life stories, will not be disappointed.",4,The Butler,1378771200,"09 10, 2013",2013,4056,"['4', '1/2', 'starsThe', 'Butler', 'aka', 'Lee', 'Daniel', 'Butler', 'emotional', 'powerful', 'film', 'based', 'story', 'real', 'life', 'butler', 'who', 'worked', 'White', 'House', 'film', 'deals', 'primarily', 'civil', 'rights', 'movement', 'life', 'African-American', 'youth', 'who', 'up', 'be', 'butler', 'employed', 'White', 'House', 'relationship', 'subservient', 'African-American', 'butler', 'who', 'must', 'never', 'speak', 'mind', 'react', 'being', 'said', 'very', 'powerful', 'white', 'people', 'highlights', 'deplorably', 'low', 'status', 'society', 'African-Americans', 'endured', 'especially', 'time', 'butler', 'named', 'Cecil', 'Gaines', 'film', 'was', 'employed', 'White', 'House', 'addition', 'effects', 'Vietnam', 'American', 'politics', 'general', 'are', 'well', 'explored', 'experienced', 'Cecil', 'family', 'However', 'well', 'done', 'performances', 'film', 'are', 'tremendously', 'good', 'poignant', 'storyline', 'bit', 'choppy', 'example', 'earlier', 'years', 'butler', 'Cecil', 'working', 'White', 'House', 'are', 'explored', 'greater', 'detail', 'length', 'later', 'years', 'President', 'Ford', 'administration', 'dealt', 'barely', 'more', '15', 'seconds', 'see', 'clip', 'talking', 'television', 'President', 'President', 'Carter', ""n't"", 'get', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'film', 'either', 'still', 'more', 'plot', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'out', 'can', 'watch', 'appreciate', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'did.I', 'also', 'give', 'filmmakers', 'others', 'who', 'worked', 'film', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'credit', 'making', 'come', 'alive', 'example', 'makeup', 'was', 'so', 'convincing', 'could', 'completely', 'believe', 'people', 'Cecil', 'are', 'aging', 'movie', 'sets', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'choreography', 'cinematography', 'shine', 'musical', 'score', 'not', 'too', 'extensive', 'certainly', 'musical', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'making', 'more', 'powerful', 'memorable.Again', 'however', 'story', 'African-American', 'man', 'quest', 'least', 'half-way', 'decent', 'life', 'least', 'survival', 'family', 'world', 'white', 'man', 'dominated', 'black', 'man', 'truly', 'captivated', 'plot', 'full', 'poignant', 'moments', 'brought', 'tears', 'sadness', 'eyes', 'see', 'butler', 'Cecil', 'Gaines', 'played', 'panache', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'so', 'broken', 'scarred', 'horrific', 'violence', 'witnessed', 'youth', 'when', 'son', 'Louis', 'David', 'Oyelowo', 'join', 'Freedom', 'Riders', 'promptly', 'angrily', 'movement', 'futile', 'Cecil', 'also', 'Louis', 'even', 'just', 'attend', 'civil', 'rights', 'rally', 'held', 'late', '1950s', 'when', 'family', 'already', 'living', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'supposedly', 'course', 'not', 'really', 'treated', 'noticeably', 'better', 'African-Americans', 'were', 'treated', 'South', 'Oprah', 'Winfrey', 'portrayal', 'Cecil', 'wife', 'Gloria', 'strengths', 'inner', 'demons', 'also', 'stunned', 'raw', 'power', 'Oprah', 'ability', 'make', 'Gloria', 'come', 'real', 'life', 'screen', 'remarkable', 'Adriane', 'Lenox', 'Gina', 'Pernell', 'Walker', 'Lorraine', 'astounded', 'exceptionally', 'convincing', 'performances', 'wo', ""n't"", 'forget', 'anytime', 'are', 'many', 'others', 'have', 'noted', 'quite', 'few', 'big', 'name', 'stars', 'who', 'lend', 'presence', 'film', 'make', 'even', 'more', 'powerful', 'Look', 'Mariah', 'Carey', 'Hattie', 'Pearl', 'Cecil', 'mother', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', 'Annabeth', 'Westfall', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Dwight', 'D.', 'Eisenhower', 'John', 'Cusack', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'James', 'Marsden', 'John', 'F.', 'Kennedy', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'Lyndon', 'B.', 'Johnson', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'Ronald', 'Nancy', 'Reagan', 'Clarence', 'Williams', 'III', 'Maynard', 'Jim', 'Gleason', 'R.D', 'Warner', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'Carter', 'Wilson', 'Lenny', 'Kravitz', 'James', 'Holloway', 'Minka', 'Kelly', 'Jacqueline', 'Kennedy.Overall', 'Butler', 'will', 'remain', 'one', 'better', 'films', '2013', 'highly', 'recommend', 'people', 'interested', 'racial', 'issues', 'history', 'country', 'long', 'rocky', 'struggle', 'become', 'society', 'everyone', 'truly', 'equal', 'addition', 'people', 'who', 'appreciate', 'dramas', 'especially', 'dramas', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'stories', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A

Druxman ""A Good Story is a Terribl...","[2, 6]","Lee Daniels' THE BUTLER tells the story of the American civil rights movement, as viewed from the perspectives of a an African-American, working as a butler in the White House, and his family.  It&#8217;s a powerful film, filled with many notable scenes and performances, however there are times when the narrative seems to lose its way.Forest Whitaker stars as Cecil Gaines, who was raised in the 1920s on a Southern cotton plantation where he witnessed the owner rape his mother and murder his father without legal consequences.  After working as a house servant on the plantation, then moving to Washington D.C. where he is employed in a upscale hotel, Gaines is invited to join the White House staff.  He stays there for thirty years, serving from the Eisenhower through the Reagan administrations.Paralleling his years at the White House is Gaines&#8217; personal journey, in which he travels from being the compliant butler who is &#8220;invisible&#8221; to those he serves, to becoming a man who is not afraid to stand up for his rights in a free society.  Complicating his life is an alcoholic wife (Oprah Winfrey) and an activist son (David Oyelowo) who becomes a Freedom Rider and a member of the Black Panthers.I don&#8217;t want to be a spoiler, so I&#8217;ll just say that I certainly understand why director Lee Daniels and writer Danny Strong wanted to bring their story up into the Obama Administration, however from a strictly dramatic standpoint, I think the film would have been more effective had it ended ten minutes earlier.That said, the cast in Lee Daniels&#8217; THE BUTLER is nothing short of magnificent.  It includes Robin Williams (as Eisenhower),  John Cusack (Nixon), Cuba Gooding, Jr., Lenny Kravitz, Terrence Howard,  James Marsden (Kennedy), Liev Schreiber (Johnson), Alan Rickman and Jane Fonda (the Reagans) and Vanessa Redgrave.The Blu-Ray/DVD/Digital combo pack from Anchor Bay Entertainment contains many extras, including a &#8220;Behind the Scenes&#8221; documentary, several deleted scenes, a gag reel and more.

For whatever reason, his name was changed in this film to Cecil Gaines (Forest Whitaker).  The film opens in Macon, Georgia where Cecil (Isaac White) and his parents are sharecroppers on a cotton farm.In the south, things hadn't changed all that much from the Civil War.  Cecil's mother (Mariah Carey) is raped on a regular basis by one of the land owners (Alex Pettyfer).  When his father (David Banner) says something, he is gunned down in front of the boy.  The young boy is taken in to the ""big"" house and is trained to be a server to the family.  Once he has grown, he strikes out on his own and heads north.  He catches a job at a large Washington, D. C. hotel and gets a call from a White House staffer to come in for an interview.  He is hired and so it begins.Cecil's days at the White House, while at times interesting, are but a backdrop for what the film is really about.  The relationship between Cecil and his oldest son, Louis (David Oyelowo).  The heart of the film takes place during the civil rights struggles of 1960's and `70's.  As Louis gets older and heads off to college, he becomes more and more active in the civil rights movement, eventually becoming a ""freedom rider"" and then a member of the Black Panther Party.As Cecil struggles with his son's activism, his marriage to Gloria (Oprah Winfrey) is on the wane thanks to his long hours and her struggles with alcohol.  These are 3 terrific performances and they certainly carry the film, although I was admittedly curious to see how the various presidents and their wives would be portrayed by the line of celebrity actors who quickly step on and off the screen.  Most were just short of awful.I will also give a mention to Cuba Gooding Jr. as Carter Wilson, one of Cecil's co-workers.  He manages to add a bit of levity and humanity to many of the scenes.  Note also that there are some brutal portrayals, some staged for this film and some historical newsreels that provide viewers with a reminder of the struggles of the era.

If this is a major issue for you (it is for many folks), be forewarned then; a significant example occurs early on, as our title character (named Cecil Gaines in the film) leaves the plantation he's working on in the south largely because of an incident of violence that did not in fact happen to the real Eugene Allen.  There are other important details in the film that are fictionalized or altered; this one is worth mentioning because it makes for a greater contrast between the life he left and the life he gained than there actually was.  Given the harsh realities of black life before, during, and even after the Civil Rights era, I'm not sure it was necessary to begin the film with such violence.But this is not, for me, a huge problem, and I think the film's general thrust - that a black man's service to the men who occupied the highest office in the land did not exempt him from indignities small and large, and that there was still blatant racism even in the White House, even years after MLK, Malcolm X, and the Civil Rights Act - rings true and is generally well and potently told.  Forest Whitaker, one of the finest American actors of his generation in this reviewer's opinion, gives a typically excellent and well-rounded performance, playing a character who is essentially passive for much of the film but managing to give him plenty of pathos, dignity, and occasional moments of emotional power.  I don't think it's anything close to Whitaker's best performance - that would be his monumental portrayal of Charlie Parker inBird- but the difficulties in playing a static character who must hide his emotions over much of his life shouldn't be underestimated.  David Oyelowo as Gaines' eldest son Louis - Freedom Rider, close associate of Dr. King, Black Panther, and ultimately Congressman - is just as impressive, and the rocky relationship between the father who is willing (generally) to wait for black lives to get better, and the angry son who will do anything to help create equality NOW, is at the heart of the story.Louis, though, does cast a light on one of the problems with the film - the need to hit every historical event possible, to put the Gaines family in the center of as much of black experience as can possibly be shown from the 60s through the present.  Louis' achievements aren't impossible and are mirrored in some real-life people, but added to all of the close associations that his father seems to have with every President - being alone with Jackie as she weeps over JFK, hearing Reagan defend his South Africa policies but then later listening to him wonder aloud if he was right, handing LBJ his toilet paper, etc - does make it all seem a little ""Forrest Gump"" at times.  And the famous names who play the Presidents, including Robin Williams as Ike, John Cusack as Nixon, and Alan Rickman as Reagan, distract as much as they add any dramatic urgency to the story. I'm also not entirely sure that Daniels and his screenwriter Danny Strong needed to soft-pedal the actions and attitudes of the Presidents themselves; the film leaves you with the feeling that the men who served in the office were all (eventually) pretty decent-minded when it came to their attitudes about race (though admitting that LBJ, Nixon and Reagan had quite imperfect records) and one feels that the blame is placed almost entirely on southern racists.  It feels a little gutless at times, in refusing to really take these men or their administrations to task.  As the film draws to an end, it all adds up to a frankly predictable, play-your-heartstrings finale that honestly didn't need to be pitched at the emotional heights that it hit. The real story - or something closer to it - would have felt a bit more satisfying to me.  But if you're a big fan of the traditional Hollywood ending, you may not mind; and I will say that there was a tear or two on my face, despite the ""oh, of course this is the way he'll end it"" feeling.And a big part of that lump-in-the-throat effect, I'm pleased to say, was due to Oprah Winfrey's outstanding portrayal of Gloria, Cecil's brash, sexually charged, hard-drinking, but world-weary and always caring wife Gloria.  I'll say right off that I've never been a huge fan of Oprah's TV show, or her public persona.  Maybe it's because she often seems to be putting on an act even when I'm fairly sure she's not; and I think that's because she really is a born performer.  I HAVE been a big fan of her as an actress, and her Gloria is almost as memorable as her Sethe in Jonathan Demme's criminally underratedBeloved.  There's a wonderful toughness and brittleness and intelligence in Gloria, but also a crazy side, and one of the major achievements of ""The Butler"" is as a convincing portrait of a tumultuous marriage in which each partner really does seem to realistically complement the other.So to sum up, this certainly isn't a film that feels real as history - a little too much is stuffed in - and it's a little too Hollywood and sentimental at the end for my tastes.  But it does feel emotionally true to the periods, and it is well worth seeing for the excellent performances, especially that of Oprah Winfrey.  I don't think the great film about the American Civil Rights era has been made yet, but ""The Butler"" does get more right than it gets wrong, and it's eminently watchable.",4,Oprah is the main reason

There is a notable subplot to the narrative as Cecil's eldest son, Louis, strives to bring about social change. History is deeply woven into the story, at times with some liberties, and both Cecil and Louis find themselves in the midst of numerous amendments to American Civil Rights. In some instances, though, both go about delivering change in different ways. The movie does convey a particular political leaning, but the unique perspective offered by Cecil, beginning with his early life growing up on a cotton plantation in Macon, Georgia, provides the viewer with many insightful and absorbing scenes. Perhaps the most notable craft of the narrative is the way in which the lead characters participate in so much social change, and the quality of acting certainly conveys sincerity and deep emotion.Nicholas R.W.

1669399,A3V61K0EF38GP4,B00EV4EUT8,Philip Scholz,"[0, 0]","I used to think a bit less of this film because of the numerous changes made to the life of Eugene Allen, the real-life butler whom this is all based on.  I just assumed these changes were made under the name of ""artistic license"" to add more drama to the story.  Then I readThe Butler: A Witness to History, including director Lee Daniels's forward and I now understand the man's reasons for making the changes he made.While Daniels wanted to tell the story of a man who selflessly worked as a butler in the White House for thirty-four years, serving under eight U.S. Presidents from Truman to Reagan, he also wanted to tell the story of what was simultaneously going on outside of the White House...mainly the Civil Rights era.  Having read the forward in the book, I now understand this and the fact that, in order to tie it all together, changes had to be made.  I consequently like the movie a lot more than I once did.Forest Whitaker was by far my favorite in the film, playing Cecil Gaines, Eugene Allen's film counterpart.  He played the character with a quiet self-confidence that Allen surely possessed in life.  I thought it was a bit clich&eacute; for him to have personal conversations with many of the Presidents, but Whitaker's subtle ability to draw in an audience in made it work.  I admit I wasn't sure about the casting of Oprah Winfrey as Whitaker's wife, but she did well.  The older of their sons, played by David Oyelowo, was a portal for his family, and the audience, to see the struggles going on throughout the nation, especially in the South, as people fought for Civil Rights.  You could see the conflict between father and son...it all felt genuine and that made the ending between them all the more satisfying.  The second son, played by Elijah Kelley, was there just so there could be a second son.  But he served one purpose, which was to illustrate a second conflict going on at the time.  I knew nothing about either of these actors before they played these boys, but I was quite impressed by both of them.  Another person who really impressed me was Aml Ameen, who played Cecil Gaines at age 15.  The scene of his time at the caf&eacute; or diner or whatever it was was perhaps my favorite in the film.As for the other supporting characters, this film featured a cast of all-stars.  I did find it weird to see Robin Williams never crack a joke anywhere in a movie he was in, but  he played a fine Dwight D. Eisenhower...in fact, I didn't see Robin Williams at all...I only saw Eisenhower.  Same goes for John Qusack, who disappeared into his role as Richard Nixon.  James Marsden once commented on all the Oscars and nominees he played alongside, but he can stand proudly among these folks as he was a fine John F. Kennedy.  In the end, everyone who played a historical figure did a great job.  My favorite among this crowd would have to be Robin Williams as Eisenhower.  As for the fictional supporting characters, Cuba Gooding, Jr., was my favorite, but he didn't get nearly the amount of screen time he deserved.The story was great as well.  As I've explained, I've changed my mind and really do like it as opposed to the first time I saw it in theaters.  There was never a dull moment throughout and many cast members, such as Oprah Winfrey and Mariah Carey, really surprised me, doing much better than I would have guessed.I fully recommend this film as it delivers a worthwhile plot from beginning to end...and the final line will make you laugh and just smile right afterward because both Forest Whitaker and Cecil Gaines totally deserved to say that line after everything they had been through.

I have no idea of any background interest by the megastar but I kept imagining in the theatre, that the Director and Editor was perhaps scared to make her ""supportive"" of Forest Whitaker. He is excellent, as well. (Was he the star?).A secondary criticism is in the ""aging"" of the stars. Forest looks exactly the same in 1974 as he did in 1954. Oprah ages about 30 years in one 5 year period.We also get a small, and very unnecessary and depressing soap opera involving the neglected Oprah and the next door neighbor dude. Super acting, yes, but what a mistake.That plus too many administration recollections...the Eisenhower years are very well done (although Robin Williams is pretty awful as Ike). Then we get the Camelot years, but Jack looks about 27 years old. Another good (albeit disturbing) set of scenes involves the reluctant war monger but socially beneficient LBJ. Then we find the older and wiser Nixon, surprisingly well represented - when it was all said and done, the ""crook"" came up with enterprise zones for minorities.The Carter and Reagan years could have been cut. This Reviewer feels that Reagan, although a man of vision (Welfare Reform and ""47% pay no Fed. taxes"", etc.), was past his prime. Still, the very cold portrayal here, is quite unnerving. Here's a Leader who took a bullet for his Country.So, sadly, we get another coulda-shoulda from ""Hollywood"". Another movie twenty minutes too long.Positives are too numerous to mention: it's a great review of the Civil Rights movement through the eyes of a family, a Father, who must look away from political machinations six feet away from him and serve cookies to segregationists; a Son, equally concerned about his country, but willing to demonstrate (and take his Life in his hands).",4,life changing - buy it....but be prepared for alot of draggy melodrama,1379030400,"09 13, 2013",2013,1894,"['based', 'theatre', 'viewing', 'Above-mentioned', 'flaws', 'include', 'too', 'many', 'close-ups', 'Oprah', 'who', 'none', 'less', 'outstanding', 'have', 'idea', 'background', 'interest', 'megastar', 'kept', 'imagining', 'theatre', 'Director', 'Editor', 'was', 'perhaps', 'scared', 'make', 'supportive', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'excellent', 'as', 'well', 'star', '.A', 'secondary', 'criticism', 'aging', 'stars', 'Forest', 'exactly', 'same', '1974', 'did', '1954', '30', 'years', 'one', '5', 'year', 'period.We', 'also', 'get', 'small', 'very', 'unnecessary', 'depressing', 'soap', 'opera', 'involving', 'neglected', 'Oprah', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'dude', 'Super', 'acting', 'yes', 'what', 'mistake.That', 'too', 'many', 'administration', 'recollections', 'Eisenhower', 'years', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'pretty', 'awful', 'Ike', 'Then', 'get', 'Camelot', 'years', 'Jack', '27', 'years', 'old', 'good', 'disturbing', 'set', 'scenes', 'reluctant', 'war', 'monger', 'socially', 'beneficient', 'LBJ', 'Then', 'find', 'older', 'wiser', 'Nixon', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'represented', 'when', 'was', 'said', 'done', 'crook', 'came', 'up', 'enterprise', 'zones', 'minorities.The', 'Carter', 'Reagan', 'years', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'Reviewer', 'Reagan', 'man', 'vision', 'Welfare', 'Reform', '47', '%', 'pay', 'Fed', 'taxes', 'etc', 'was', 'prime', 'Still', 'very', 'cold', 'portrayal', 'here', 'quite', 'unnerving', 'Here', 'Leader', 'who', 'took', 'bullet', 'Country.So', 'sadly', 'get', 'coulda-shoulda', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'too', 'long.Positives', 'are', 'too', 'numerous', 'mention', 'great', 'review', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'movement', 'eyes', 'family', 'Father', 'who', 'must', 'look', 'away', 'political', 'machinations', 'six', 'feet', 'away', 'serve', 'cookies', 'segregationists', 'Son', 'equally', 'concerned', 'country', 'willing', 'demonstrate', 'take', 'Life', 'hands']",N/A

Anyway this movie would of got 5 stars if the political favoritism was left out. I am so sick of the political bashing. I just want a real story. Hotel Rwanda shows a real hero who saved so many lives. The movie won many awards. Ofcourse even though it was nominated for an academy they didn't win. Probably because of Rwanda's dislike of Clinton. The Butler was not done in good taste as to show the real struggles of the civil rights era. The real tragedies. The real people. I believe the civil rights era had many passionate people. And I hope to one day see a civil rights movie done with passion just like Hotel Rwanda was done. Show me hero's. People who fought.

1669437,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00EV4EUT8,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 0]","""Lee Daniels' The Butler"" is a highly fictionalized account of the life of Eugene Allen, a black man who served as butler in the White House for 34 years (he was even there to greet the first black president in 2009). It's so highly fictionalized, in fact, that even the character's name has been changed to Cecil Gaines.Allen - and by proxy, Gaines' - years of service coincided with one of the most volatile periods in the nation's history in terms of civil rights advances. As conceived by screenwriter Danny Strong, Cecil is a near-Zelig (or Forrest Gump, if you prefer)-type character who stands witness to history as a cavalcade of presidents, policy makers, racists, civil rights activists and seminal events go marching by on their way to the future.Though it has its share of undeniable shortcomings, ""The Butler"" does a couple of things very well. First, it effectively drives home the very real reasons blacks in the pre-civil rights era had for deferring to whites. At a time when even the slightest hint of reproach or of standing up for oneself could result in society-sanctioned death (be it through beating, shooting or lynching), it's understandable that many blacks developed a go-along-to-get-along mentality just to survive.  And that's where the second quality aspect of the movie comes in: the illustration of just how much courage it took for the early ""agitators"" to stand up against the deeply entrenched system of Jim Crow laws that for decades allowed such atrocities to go unpunished. Cecil is caught between the old-school view of not rocking the boat and the new era of radical change in which blacks - along with sympathetic white allies - have begun to assert their right to be treated as equals. This leads to much butting of heads between Cecil and his son, Louis (David Oyelowo), a Freedom Rider who refuses to stand back and wait for change to come incrementally and at the white man's behest, opting instead to take a more proactive role in actualizing his own future - even at the risk of being beaten, imprisoned or even murdered for his efforts. And at what point should non-violent passive resistance yield to violent self-defense and retaliation when the former seems to be yielding few tangible results?""The Butler"" is at its most compelling when it is dealing with such issues. On the debit side, the movie provides an array of none-too-impressive impersonations of famous people - Robin Williams as Eisenhower,  John Cusack as Nixon, James Marsden as Kennedy, Minka Kelly as Jackie, Liev Schreiber as Johnson, Alan Rickman as Reagan, Jane Fonda as Nancy, Nelsan Ellis as Martin Luther King, Jr. - doubly hampered by less-than-convincing makeup jobs in many of those cases. Moreover, the movie can't entirely avoid that taint of smug self-righteousness that inevitably attaches itself to movies whose main purpose for being is to Do Good. It's particularly egregious in the lugubrious narration delivered by the main character. Yet even that is kept to an acceptable minimum.Forest Whitaker does well with a role that is too sketchily written at times, for when a character is being called upon to be Everyman, he often emerges as No Man. One often gets the sense that the events that happen to him are less the product of a life being organically lived and more contrivances designed to make him a symbol of the times in which he lived. By its very nature, the schematic nature of the storytelling deprives the man of his much of his individuality, which should definitely not be the case in a movie in which individuality and personhood are at the very core of its message.Of the supporting performers, it is Oprah Winfrey who makes the deepest mark as Cecil's alcoholic, philandering wife, a woman whose combination of virtues and flaws makes her a convincing, relatable character.  Other well-known faces in the cast include Terrance Howard as her love interest, Vanessa Redgrave as a plantation owner, Maria Carey as Cecil's young mother, Cuba Gooding, Jr. as the White House's chief butler, Clarence Williams III as the man who inspires Cecil to become a butler, and Lenny Kravtiz as a fellow butler at the White House.For all its flaws, ""The Butler"" ultimately reminds us that it takes both the Cecile Gainses and the Louis Gainses to truly change society.

1669441,AS6K15HL31TDW,B00EV4EUT8,R. Sumners,"[1, 2]","There might be a few spoilers here. Just saying.I saw ""The Butler"" last night. A good, very ambitious, but flawed film, definitely worth seeing for its emotional overview of the Civil Rights struggle of the '60's and '70's (and continuing into the '80's), and the great performances by Forest Whitaker as Cecil Gaines and Oprah Winfrey as his wife, who I think shared a great chemistry. The film had some very good, very moving moments--it was based, loosely, on the life of Eugene Allen, who served as a waiter and eventually as the chief butler to the President from 1952 until 1986. I think the film would have been better served had it followed his life a bit more closely. Cecil Gaines' son becomes an almost Forrest Gumpian/Tom Joadian character who manages to coincidentally find himself somehow thrust smack dab into the middle of just about ever major turning point in the Civil Rights movement--he's at the lunch counter in Woolworth's, he's beaten as a Freedom Rider, he just happens to be there when Dr. King is assassinated, he becomes a Black Panther--you name it, ma, and he's there. It's an effective yet unsubtle plot device, I suppose, to give an overview of history, and the events that are portrayed are done so in an effective manner and are a powerful testament to the fundamental courage of those involved in the Civil Rights Movement and the utter hell they went through just to be treated like human beings, but it's too much to be happening to one person when so many individuals were involved. It's just a bit contrived for a serious drama. Also, I found the casting of most of the Presidents to be, well, less than stellar, especially Johnson and Nixon, although the image of LBJ carrying on intense conversations with his staff while sitting on the toilet with the door open was hilarious, because, well, he really did that. I also suppose I have a bit of an issue with the official title of the film: ""Lee Daniel's The Butler"". Really? Could there be a bit of an ego issue here? Even Orson Wells didn't go with ""Orson Wells' Citizen Kane"", and he had an ego that could change the tidal patterns. Everyone knows who directed the film, the work can speak for itself. All in all, though, the film was interesting, well worth watching, and at times a very powerful portrayal of the Civil Rights movement, with a somewhat mixed bag of performances, although Forest Whitaker and Oprah Winfrey were excellent.

The movie itself should win the Oscar for 2013!  It is an outstanding combination of the life of Cecil Gaines, a black man who comes up from the cotton fields of Georgia and becomes a butler at the White House who becomes well respected by Presidents, staff, and his peers.  It combines an historic background of the Civil Rights Movement in America starting back in the late '50's through the election of Barack Obama.  It is so moving to see (even though I grew up in that era) what the black people continued to go through to become equal citizens of the United States.  It is hard to imagine what you see they had to go through - especially in the South - where most people were merciless in their treatment of the coloreds.  I loved this movie...I saw it and I just bought it because I want to see it again and again!  I just wish more movies of this caliber were being made today.

As other posters in this forum have commented, the life of Gaines was not portrayed very well. His elder son's active involvement in the civil rights movement was both much more interesting and informative than Gaines' brief and mostly general one-on-ones with a few of the presidents under whom he served.Additionally, devoting at least 10 minutes to Obama's election (which included part of Obama's victory speech) more than 20 years after Gaines retired was pure propaganda in this film co-starring Obama savior Oprah. The significance of that event is acknowledged, but giving that more than 5 year-old event at least 10 times the amount of screen time as most of the '70s is grossly disproportional. Also, we already knew the particular significance of that event to the titular butler and other black people who lived through the civil rights movements.It should further be noted that Obama received as much (if not more) screen time as Kennedy, under whom Gaines served and who played a HUGE role in the movement that led to developments that contributed to Obama being a viable candidate.",2,Should Have Been Based on Butler's Son,1388966400,"01 6, 2014",2014,1406,"['Watching', 'film', 'evoked', 'thoughts', 'reviews', ""'90s"", 'sitcom', '34', 'Will', 'Grace', '34', 'were', 'published', 'summer', 'series', 'premiered', 'articles', 'stated', 'show', 'should', 'be', 'called', '34', 'Jack', 'Karen', '34', 'due', 'supporting', 'characters', 'being', 'more', 'interesting', 'titular', 'leads', 'other', 'posters', 'forum', 'have', 'commented', 'life', 'Gaines', 'was', 'not', 'portrayed', 'very', 'well', 'elder', 'son', 'active', 'involvement', 'civil', 'rights', 'movement', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'informative', 'Gaines', 'brief', 'mostly', 'general', 'one-on-ones', 'few', 'presidents', 'whom', 'served.Additionally', 'devoting', 'least', '10', 'minutes', 'Obama', 'election', 'included', 'part', 'Obama', 'victory', 'speech', 'more', '20', 'years', 'Gaines', 'retired', 'was', 'pure', 'propaganda', 'film', 'co-starring', 'Obama', 'savior', 'Oprah', 'significance', 'event', 'acknowledged', 'giving', 'more', '5', 'year-old', 'event', 'least', '10', 'times', 'amount', 'screen', 'time', 'most', ""'70s"", 'grossly', 'disproportional', 'Also', 'already', 'knew', 'particular', 'significance', 'event', 'titular', 'butler', 'other', 'black', 'people', 'who', 'lived', 'civil', 'rights', 'movements.It', 'should', 'further', 'be', 'noted', 'Obama', 'received', 'as', 'much', 'not', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'Kennedy', 'whom', 'Gaines', 'served', 'who', 'played', 'HUGE', 'role', 'movement', 'led', 'developments', 'contributed', 'Obama', 'being', 'viable', 'candidate']",N/A

I would like to point out that Amazon has a policy of combining all formats of a film (theater, DVD, Bluray and Amazon Instant) together when providing reviews. I always recommend that those seeking a review of a DVD or Bluray sort by date &#8211; you can choose &#8220;newest first&#8221;  - and then look to see which format the reviewer is discussing. This review is of the DVD version (including the &#8220;Bonus Features&#8221;).I won&#8217;t spend a lot of time discussing the film itself, except to say that it does provide a capsule history of the civil rights movement in the US between 1957 and (roughly) 1977. (There is a bit of an update to 2008 with the inauguration of President Obama. ). The film uses the device  of centering  the story around  the life of the White House butler  - Cecil Gaines  -who served seven Presidents,.  Gaines childhood life and early butler career are summed up in the first 21 minutes of this 132-minute film. He is soon in the White House serving President Eisenhower (played by Robin Williams, and not looking at all (IMHO) like Ike). We see some other Presidents that Gaines served ( JFK, Reagan, Nixon and Johnson &#8211; the latter two are played for laughs).  Jane Fonda gets a shot at portraying Nancy Reagan (an inside joke?). There are big celebrity names all over the cast list and I lost count at the end when the list of Producers and &#8220;Executive Producers&#8221; scrolled by. But this is the kind of film that the Weinstein brothers (Bob and Harvey) love to produce, in addition to the much smaller (and, in my opinion, better) films like the recent Oscar-winning &#8220;20 Feet From Stardom&#8221; and &#8220;Fruitvale Station&#8221;.  Yes, Oprah is on screen a lot and the problem for me was that she looks and sounds like Oprah, while Forrest Whitaker- as Gaines &#8211; actually inhabited the role. I just felt that the screenplay tried to cover too much. After all, the basis for the film was just a magazine article. If you want to know about the Freedom Riders (a major part of the story) you can do better with the recent PBS documentary (which I&#8217;ve reviewed elsewhere on Amazon.)The DVD has a bunch of bonuses, though the only one I found worthwhile was the six-minute featurette on &#8220;The Original Freedom Riders&#8221; . There&#8217;s a 21-minute &#8220;making of&#8221; featurette with cast and crew but it spends a lot of time showing scenes from the film. The 20 minutes or so of &#8220;deleted scenes&#8221; didn&#8217;t add much for me either. And the including of a 5-minute &#8220;gag reel&#8221; in a film like this on a serious subject seemed like feeler too. Finally there is a 2 minute performance of Gladys Knight and Lenny Kravitz singing a song from the film&#8217;s soundtrack.I had high hopes for this film and it never reached them for me, however, Oprah is a draw and may bring in younger folks who don&#8217;t know the history of the Civil Rights movement is the US and even encourage them to dig deeper. As someone who lived through the same presidential terms as Gaines, I knew the story and watched it on TV every night. So there was nothing new here and some of the casting let me down as well.So it gets three stars from me (in Amazon&#8217;s code that &#8220;It&#8217;s OK&#8221;).I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm&#8220;Anything Phonographic&#8221;",3,Review of the DVD (and its bonuses) &#8211; Celebrity casting dampens the impact of story of Civil Rights movement.,1393977600,"03 5, 2014",2014,3465,"['post', 'review', 'are', 'already', '1,100', 'reviews', 'film', 'would', 'like', 'point', 'out', 'Amazon', 'policy', 'combining', 'formats', 'film', 'theater', 'DVD', 'Bluray', 'Amazon', 'Instant', 'together', 'when', 'providing', 'reviews', 'always', 'recommend', 'seeking', 'review', 'DVD', 'Bluray', 'sort', 'date', '8211', 'can', 'choose', '8220', 'newest', 'first', '8221', 'then', 'look', 'see', 'format', 'reviewer', 'discussing', 'review', 'DVD', 'version', 'including', '8220', 'Bonus', 'Features', '8221', '.I', 'won', '8217', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'discussing', 'film', 'say', 'provide', 'capsule', 'history', 'civil', 'rights', 'movement', 'US', '1957', 'roughly', '1977', 'bit', 'update', '2008', 'inauguration', 'President', 'Obama', 'film', 'device', 'centering', 'story', 'life', 'White', 'House', 'butler', 'Cecil', 'Gaines', '-who', 'served', 'seven', 'Presidents', 'Gaines', 'childhood', 'life', 'early', 'butler', 'career', 'are', 'summed', 'up', 'first', '21', 'minutes', '132-minute', 'film', 'soon', 'White', 'House', 'serving', 'President', 'Eisenhower', 'played', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'not', 'looking', 'IMHO', 'Ike', 'see', 'other', 'Presidents', 'Gaines', 'served', 'JFK', 'Reagan', 'Nixon', 'Johnson', '8211', 'latter', 'two', 'are', 'played', 'laughs', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'shot', 'portraying', 'Nancy', 'Reagan', 'inside', 'joke', 'are', 'big', 'celebrity', 'names', 'cast', 'list', 'lost', 'count', 'end', 'when', 'list', 'Producers', '8220', 'Executive', 'Producers', '8221', 'scrolled', 'kind', 'film', 'Weinstein', 'brothers', 'Bob', 'Harvey', 'love', 'produce', 'addition', 'much', 'smaller', 'opinion', 'better', 'films', 'recent', 'Oscar-winning', '8220', '20', 'Feet', 'From', 'Stardom', '8221', '8220', 'Fruitvale', 'Station', '8221', 'Yes', 'Oprah', 'screen', 'lot', 'problem', 'was', 'like', 'Oprah', 'Forrest', 'Whitaker-', 'Gaines', '8211', 'actually', 'inhabited', 'role', 'just', 'felt', 'screenplay', 'tried', 'cover', 'too', 'much', 'basis', 'film', 'was', 'just', 'magazine', 'article', 'want', 'know', 'Freedom', 'Riders', 'major', 'part', 'story', 'can', 'do', 'better', 'recent', 'PBS', 'documentary', '8217', 'reviewed', 'elsewhere', 'Amazon', 'DVD', 'bunch', 'bonuses', 'only', 'one', 'found', 'worthwhile', 'was', 'six-minute', 'featurette', '8220', 'Original', 'Freedom', 'Riders', '8221', '8217', 's', '21-minute', '8220', 'making', '8221', 'featurette', 'cast', 'crew', 'lot', 'time', 'showing', 'scenes', 'film', '20', 'minutes', 'so', '8220', 'deleted', 'scenes', '8221', '8217', 'add', 'much', 'including', '5-minute', '8220', 'reel', '8221', 'film', 'serious', 'subject', 'seemed', 'feeler', 'too', 'Finally', '2', 'minute', 'performance', 'Gladys', 'Knight', 'Lenny', 'Kravitz', 'singing', 'song', 'film', '8217', 'soundtrack.I', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'film', 'never', 'reached', 'however', 'Oprah', 'draw', 'may', 'bring', 'younger', 'folks', 'who', 'don', '8217', 'know', 'history', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'movement', 'US', 'even', 'encourage', 'dig', 'deeper', 'someone', 'who', 'lived', 'same', 'presidential', 'terms', 'Gaines', 'knew', 'story', 'watched', 'TV', 'night', 'was', 'nothing', 'new', 'here', 'casting', 'let', 'down', 'well.So', 'three', 'stars', 'Amazon', '8217', 'code', '8220', '8217', 'OK', '8221', '.I', 'hope', 'found', 'review', 'informative', 'helpful.Steve', 'Ramm', '8220', 'Anything', 'Phonographic', '8221']",N/A

Gaines served in the White House from the Dwight Eisenhower administration to the Ronald Reagan presidency.  The story is loosely based on the true story of Eugene Allen, the real life Cecil Gaines.The movie's main focus is about the plight and struggle of African Americans during that time.  It also deals with other key points in American history, such as the assassination of President John Kennedy to name one.  The story is told in a very simplistic manner.  It goes from one presidency to the next and, basically, highlights the key events Gaines witnessed during each one.The film stars Forest Whitaker as Gaines.  He is supported by Oprah, Cuba Gooding Jr. and other stars as well.  The film also includes Robin Williams in a small role playing Eisenhower.  There was good chemistry between the cast.  At 2 hours and 10 minutes long, the film seemed to move fairly quickly.  It was interesting to see how each President dealt with certain African American issues.The film definitely deserves five stars.  I just wish it was not a fictionalized account.  For instance, Allen only had one son.  In the film, he has two.  There are certain scenes that could not have happened because of this.It would have been nice to know the true story of Eugene Allen.  What great tales and insight could that man give us by telling his stories.  It deserves to be, at least, a book.  Unfortunately, that will never happen.

I'd like to have seen more of the in between, more of Cecil Gaines' younger years before he became a butler at the White House, how he met his wife, how he applied for the job, etc. From all I've read, this film is merely &#34;based&#34; on fact with much fictional embellishment. It's very episodic, paralelling scenes in the White House with what's happening in the Civil Rights movement at the time, one causing or in conjunction with the other and being balanced by what's happening in Gaines' personal life in that same moment.

He becomes a domestic servant for the family that owns the plantation. His skill at that position leads him to become a butler at the White House, a job he keeps for 30 years. During this time he watches the Civil Rights movement unfold with his son in the middle of it all. I was pretty excited about this movie because not only am I a huge history buff but also love bio-pics and movies based on true stories. While 90% of the movie never really happened that's not the reason why I was disappointed. The thing that really bothered me was Cecil himself. Even though he was a great servant to Presidents he wasn't a good family man and never supported his son at all. That really bothered me and because of that I found it really hard to like the character. When you don't like the main character it's hard to really enjoy the movie. I'm not saying it's bad because it is worth watching but I was disappointed while watching this. Not that it matters to the enjoyment of the movie but about 90% of the movie didn't really happen the way they said it did either.

1669527,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00EV4EUT8,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","&#8220;Lee Daniels' The Butler&#8221; follows the life of Cecil Gaines (Forest Whitaker), who runs away from a cotton plantation as a boy and ends up working for a hotel in Washington DC, and then, the White House. The film&#8217;s story is inspired by the 2008 Washington Post article about a real-life butler Eugene Allen, whose life story is pretty much different from that of Cecil Gaines, as is often the case with Hollywood movies.Like &#8220;Forrest Gump,&#8221; &#8220;The Butler&#8221; is not just a drama about the titular person&#8217;s life; it is also a commentary on contemporary American history, especially the civil rights movement. One of Gaines&#8217; sons becomes campaigner for civil rights, which results in estrangement from his more conservative father. Thus the film attempts to cover more than one thing at the same time.The story of director Lee Daniels&#8217;s latest effort is more ambitious in its scope than that of &#8220;Precious&#8221; he made five years ago, but the result is a mixed bag, a movie that has something important to say, but doesn&#8217;t know how to do it effectively. With strong performances from the leads Forest Whitaker and Oprah Winfrey, &#8220;The Butler&#8221; has many emotional moments, but as a whole the film falls short on dramatic tension, lacking details that would have made the father-son relationship interesting.Despite some strange casting choice (such has John Cusack as Richard Nixon, or Alan Rickman as Ronald Reagan) and uneven pacing, &#8220;The Butler&#8221; is a largely engrossing drama thanks to the star Forest Whitaker, though the film needs more time to cover the subject matter sufficiently.",3,"Ambitious, Maybe Too Ambitious",1396396800,"04 2, 2014",2014,1674,"['8220', 'Lee', 'Daniels', 'Butler', '8221', 'life', 'Cecil', 'Gaines', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'who', 'away', 'cotton', 'plantation', 'boy', 'up', 'working', 'hotel', 'Washington', 'DC', 'then', 'White', 'House', 'film', '8217', 's', 'story', 'inspired', '2008', 'Washington', 'Post', 'article', 'real-life', 'butler', 'Eugene', 'Allen', 'life', 'story', 'pretty', 'much', 'different', 'Cecil', 'Gaines', 'often', 'case', 'Hollywood', 'movies.Like', '8220', 'Forrest', 'Gump', '8221', '8220', 'Butler', '8221', 'not', 'just', 'drama', 'titular', 'person', '8217', 's', 'life', 'also', 'commentary', 'contemporary', 'American', 'history', 'especially', 'civil', 'rights', 'movement', 'One', 'Gaines', '8217', 'sons', 'campaigner', 'civil', 'rights', 'results', 'estrangement', 'more', 'conservative', 'father', 'Thus', 'film', 'attempts', 'cover', 'more', 'one', 'thing', 'same', 'time.The', 'story', 'director', 'Lee', 'Daniels', '8217', 'latest', 'effort', 'more', 'ambitious', 'scope', '8220', 'Precious', '8221', 'made', 'five', 'years', 'ago', 'result', 'mixed', 'bag', 'movie', 'something', 'important', 'say', 'doesn', '8217', 'know', 'how', 'do', 'effectively', 'strong', 'performances', 'leads', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'Oprah', 'Winfrey', '8220', 'Butler', '8221', 'many', 'emotional', 'moments', 'whole', 'film', 'short', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'lacking', 'details', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'father-son', 'relationship', 'interesting.Despite', 'strange', 'casting', 'choice', 'such', 'John', 'Cusack', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'uneven', 'pacing', '8220', 'Butler', '8221', 'largely', 'engrossing', 'drama', 'thanks', 'star', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'film', 'more', 'time', 'cover', 'subject', 'matter', 'sufficiently']",N/A
1669528,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00EV4EUT8,Turfseer,"[17, 34]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***The dictionary tells us that the word 'contrived' is defined as ""obviously planned or forced; artificial; strained,"" as in a ""a contrived story."" And isn't that exactly what 'The Butler' is? Contrived! Director Lee Daniels and his screenwriter Danny Strong knew that they had to create an additional, secondary story, to make the true story of Eugene Allen, the Butler who served 34 years in the White House, more dramatic. This is called 'dramatic license' and all films more or less must fudge the truth a little bit to enhance the narrative.Actually, two stories were created out of whole cloth, when Daniels and Strong created the fictional character of Cecil Gaines. There was the acceptable but contrived story of inventing two sons for Gaines (in reality Allen had only one). To make things more dramatic, Gaines' son Louis, ends up becoming radicalized and butting heads with his father throughout the film. In reality, Allen modestly differed with his son about politics but he never left the Washington, D.C. area. Daniels and Strong prefer to put Louis in the middle of the every significant event in the history of the civil rights movement, like a Woody Allen 'Zelig' or a Tom Hanks 'Forrest Gump.' All well and good, but I felt uncomfortable when Louis turns up at the Lorraine Motel, and is part of Martin Luther King's entourage, hours before King's assassination. More believable, is the scene where Louis is part of a college protest against a segregated lunch counter. When Louis becomes a Black Panther and later rejects the movement and goes into politics, it just feels like a lot of this stuff has been done before and in some cases better (take a look at a much more subtle, non-Hollywood indie, 'Night Catches Us', about the legacy of the Black Panther movement).Whether you agree creating the fictional character of 'Louis' worked, it does fit under the purview of dramatic license. The opening of this film, does not. I'm referring of course to the scene of Gaines' childhood, where a white racist rapes his mother and murders his father in broad daylight, down in a cotton field in Georgia. The whole problem with this scenario is that it never happened. The real-life Allen grew up in Virginia, not in Georgia, and never underwent such an unspeakable tragedy. It's an odious scene designed to manipulate the audience into believing that 'The Butler' overcame a tremendous psychological/emotional burden, throughout his life (the other manipulative scene is the death of Gaines' second son in Vietnam--which of course also never happened in real life!).If Allen (Gaines) had witnessed such a horrific event, do you really believe he would have turned out to be the compliant and also nice guy, he ended up as? Sure, it's entirely plausible that a person with that kind of history, would have to suck it up, and appear completely cooperative, while on the job. But in his home life, I hardly can imagine a person not being scarred by such a terrible event. But here, Gaines is a mild-mannered family man, who has no bitterness. Why in real life did Allen (Gaines) have no bitterness? Because, the rape and the murder never happened. There's another reason why that scene should never have been falsely attributed to a real person's biography. If you are going to remind people of the injustices of the past, especially young people, do it in a truthful way. This is not a fictional character we're dealing with--it's a real life person, who endured racism throughout his life (but not in the incendiary way it's presented here).The other problem with 'The Butler' is that it mostly fails to make us feel that we're watching scenes of verisimilitude, involving Gaines' interactions with the various Presidents in the White House. Why was the decision made to cast well-known actors in the roles? Obviously, the big names will draw the bigger crowd. But what if casting known names, turn your scenes into veritable Saturday Night Live skits? Almost every well-known actor fails to hit the mark. Despite the prosthetics, Robin Williams simply looks like Robin Williams attempting to play Dwight Eisenhower. James Marsden does a decent enough job as JFK, but is too young for the part. John Cusack makes Nixon into a caricature and Liev Schrieber doesn't even come close to reminding us of LBJ. While they did a passable job of making Alan Rickman, look like Ronald Reagan, he acts wooden and cannot convey Reagan's affability. What's more, Lee Daniels bias against Reagan shines through, when he fails to have Reagan explain why he opposed the apartheid regime in South Africa (whether you agree with Reagan or not, at least have the character provide some explanations, as to why he acted as he did). Only Jane Fonda hits the mark as Nancy Reagan. She not only looks like her, but sounds like her too (perhaps the best cameo in the entire film).Finally there's Oprah. While she can act, she's too recognizable to play this part. She's also saddled with playing a character that's inclined toward soap opera machinations (do we really care about Mrs. Gaines' alcoholism and flirtations with the neighbor?)'The Butler' is a pure Hollywood spectacle. It features a restrained, professional job by Forrest Whitaker as 'The Butler' and has a number of notable scenes that remind us of the turbulent days of the civil rights movement. By trying to cover too much, much of 'The Butler' feels like a mere documentary. The father-son conflict works well but it's a bit perfunctory; and I felt I wanted more interesting tidbits from Allen's (Gaines') life, working in the White House. The cameos by well-known actors, were a disaster and the opening scene, is appallingly manipulative. 'The Butler' is nothing more than a mediocre effort, except for an occasional dramatic moment or two, which will stick in your memory.",2,"Attempt to fuse White House Butler story with civil rights

1669530,AZ4IUCJHXTUBD,B00EV4EUT8,"uni aum Entertainment ""uni aum Entertainment""","[1, 2]","The Butler tells the story of a White House butler who served eight American presidents over three decades. The film traces the dramatic changes that swept American society during this time, from the civil rights movement to Vietnam and beyond, and how those changes affected this man's life and family. Forest Whitaker stars as the butler with wife, Gloria, Oprah Winfrey, and many more. Academy Award nominated Lee Daniels (Precious) directs and co-wrote the script with Emmy-award winning Danny Strong (Game Change).The Butler may have virtually very little in common with its real life inspiration, White House butler Gene Allen, except for the fact that the main character of the film and Allen were both black butlers in the White House.Historical inaccuracies aside, The Butler may have been a more tolerable movie if it could have rang more authentically true. Peculiarities of the film's accuracy are most bizarre in portraying President Ronald Reagan as mailing money in ""secret"" to those who wrote him of their hardships yet he was in opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa. The son's Black Panther girlfriend YaYa DaCosta is always socially appropriate, but at a first meeting with his parents she because classless and rude? And various shots show the 1st thing written on the Black Panther manifesto is about being polite. The father doesn't approve of his son's activism, yet he is depicted as so loyal to the White House code of secrecy that he does not warn his son that the president is talking about completely annihilating everyone in his militant political party. But then the father is offended by him and his wife being treated well at a White House dinner? Kill his son, okay; treat him and his wife to dinner, causes him to rethink his entire 50 years of loyalty.Its all-star cast is its blessing and its curse. Robin Williams as Dwight Eisenhower, John Cusack as Richard Nixon, Alan Rickman as Ronald Reagan, James Marsden as John F. Kennedy, Liev Schreiber as Lyndon B. Johnson, and many more. It's cursed in having so many stars that it gets in the way of allowing its story to be told without distraction of a star that apparently was cast merely because they are a star. Mariah Carey worked well as a social worker in ""Precious"" but here, her in the cotton fields was so distracting on so many levels.When the all-star cast is a blessing, when a star's strong performance overcomes an uneven narrative. As Cecil's wife, Gloria, Oprah Winfrey gives the film's most layered performance. She's nuanced as she battles an alcohol addiction, struggles with guilt over an affair (Terrence Howard), and mediates a fractured family.Lee Daniels' The Butler is an ambitious attempt at a Hollywood-style epic around the experience of normal black Americans and the civil rights movement. The movie negates itself by so much time showing both sides of the black conscious yelling and fighting each other and not coming together until its viewer may be too fed up to care anymore.",3,Why not tell The Butler truth?,1391040000,"01 30, 2014",2014,3015,"['Butler', 'story', 'White', 'House', 'butler', 'who', 'served', 'eight', 'American', 'presidents', 'three', 'decades', 'film', 'dramatic', 'changes', 'swept', 'American', 'society', 'time', 'civil', 'rights', 'movement', 'Vietnam', 'how', 'changes', 'affected', 'man', 'life', 'family', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'butler', 'wife', 'Gloria', 'Oprah', 'Winfrey', 'many', 'more', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominated', 'Lee', 'Daniels', 'Precious', 'directs', 'co-wrote', 'script', 'Emmy-award', 'winning', 'Danny', 'Strong', 'Game', 'Change', '.The', 'Butler', 'may', 'have', 'virtually', 'very', 'little', 'common', 'real', 'life', 'inspiration', 'White', 'House', 'butler', 'Gene', 'Allen', 'fact', 'main', 'character', 'film', 'Allen', 'were', 'black', 'butlers', 'White', 'House.Historical', 'inaccuracies', 'aside', 'Butler', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'tolerable', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'rang', 'more', 'authentically', 'true', 'Peculiarities', 'film', 'accuracy', 'are', 'most', 'bizarre', 'portraying', 'President', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'mailing', 'money', 'secret', 'who', 'wrote', 'hardships', 'yet', 'was', 'opposition', 'sanctions', 'apartheid', 'South', 'Africa', 'son', 'Black', 'Panther', 'girlfriend', 'YaYa', 'DaCosta', 'always', 'socially', 'appropriate', 'first', 'meeting', 'parents', 'classless', 'rude', 'various', 'shots', 'show', '1st', 'thing', 'written', 'Black', 'Panther', 'manifesto', 'being', 'polite', 'father', ""n't"", 'approve', 'son', 'activism', 'depicted', 'so', 'loyal', 'White', 'House', 'code', 'secrecy', 'not', 'warn', 'son', 'president', 'talking', 'completely', 'annihilating', 'everyone', 'militant', 'political', 'party', 'then', 'father', 'offended', 'wife', 'being', 'treated', 'well', 'White', 'House', 'dinner', 'Kill', 'son', 'okay', 'treat', 'wife', 'dinner', 'rethink', 'entire', '50', 'years', 'loyalty.Its', 'all-star', 'cast', 'blessing', 'curse', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Dwight', 'Eisenhower', 'John', 'Cusack', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'James', 'Marsden', 'John', 'F.', 'Kennedy', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'Lyndon', 'B.', 'Johnson', 'many', 'more', 'cursed', 'having', 'so', 'many', 'stars', 'way', 'allowing', 'story', 'be', 'told', 'distraction', 'star', 'apparently', 'was', 'cast', 'merely', 'are', 'star', 'Mariah', 'Carey', 'worked', 'well', 'social', 'worker', 'Precious', 'here', 'cotton', 'fields', 'was', 'so', 'distracting', 'so', 'many', 'levels.When', 'all-star', 'cast', 'blessing', 'when', 'star', 'strong', 'performance', 'overcomes', 'uneven', 'narrative', 'Cecil', 'wife', 'Gloria', 'Oprah', 'Winfrey', 'film', 'most', 'layered', 'performance', 'nuanced', 'alcohol', 'addiction', 'guilt', 'affair', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'fractured', 'family.Lee', 'Daniels', 'Butler', 'ambitious', 'attempt', 'Hollywood-style', 'epic', 'experience', 'normal', 'black', 'Americans', 'civil', 'rights', 'movement', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'showing', 'sides', 'black', 'conscious', 'yelling', 'fighting', 'other', 'not', 'coming', 'together', 'viewer', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'fed', 'up', 'care', 'anymore']",N/A

1669537,A4YXKE5F62II8,B00EV4EUT8,Visual Bureau,"[14, 21]","""Lee Daniels' The Butler, while taking liberties from the original source, is a commendable effort with Forest Whitaker's performance as a subtle, understated White House butler in a more grounded light than we would normally see with recent race-oriented films like Django Unchained or a film from Spike Lee (which many of his films talk about something tough but boil down to a heavy and potentially one-sided argument).The film reflects much of the butler's years working since childhood to an elderly age and it reflects his life in motion with his alcoholic, disenchanted wife played by billionaire Oprah Winfrey, his rebellious son who joins the Black Panthers and demonstrates at sit-ins, and his naive youngest son who goes to Vietnam. It was a very interesting experience to watch this fictionalised persona Cecil Gaines (Whitaker), based on the real-life Eugene Allen, play it so good-to-the-bone that there is an inner sadness and melancholy in his character that amid the rebellion (son), negligence (wife), he still remains strong-minded and has a goodwill, something that is relatively important for audiences to watch and discover.The film also gets even better with some comic relief provided by Cuba Gooding, Jr. played a White House server too as well as Terrence Howard playing a smarmy, perverted neighbour. In addition, the cameos shown in the film maybe stereotypical but are relatively humanising and interesting to watch especially Liev Schreiber playing a catankerous old Lyndon B. Johnson (who led the Vietnam war) and Alan Rickman playing Ronald Reagan (whilst bizarre and accented unusually, still works in a funny way).Much of the set designs, cinematography, and editing (especially at the cut-away scenes) are well-done within the constraints of its budget much relating back to what the team done on Forrest Gump. Unfortunately, the film suffers a bit with a slightly simplistic narrative (which isn't bad given Whitaker's character and the tone of the film), a missing scene from the trailer involving Black Panthers shooting at the police, restraint from showing the horrors and carnage of both whites and blacks amid segregation, and a vague ending.While a political piece, it could've been better. As a film, it was beyond satisfactory enough and it didn't falter in the cracks like Oliver Stone's W. (2008) or Dr. Strangelove and many young people will be able-minded to understand its themes and ideas without being bored by the history of it all, especially with the rebellious son and his struggle to develop his identity.Without remorse, the film is tough material but it is important on several levels. Unfortunately, the state of affairs as of today are a result of much of this chaos (whether it be identity, race, economic status, housing, culture, and labour). But for many people-of-minority who watch the film, a lot of questions will be asked about and a doubt and inner ambition to find liberty and non-pressure elsewhere is still an uncertain one.""",4,"For history beginners, this is a cleancut yet tough take on U.S. racial politics",1385337600,"11 25, 2013",2013,2999,"['Lee', 'Daniels', 'Butler', 'taking', 'liberties', 'original', 'source', 'commendable', 'effort', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'performance', 'subtle', 'understated', 'White', 'House', 'butler', 'more', 'grounded', 'light', 'would', 'normally', 'see', 'recent', 'race-oriented', 'films', 'Django', 'Unchained', 'film', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'many', 'films', 'talk', 'something', 'tough', 'boil', 'down', 'heavy', 'potentially', 'one-sided', 'argument', '.The', 'film', 'much', 'butler', 'years', 'working', 'childhood', 'elderly', 'age', 'life', 'motion', 'alcoholic', 'disenchanted', 'wife', 'played', 'billionaire', 'Oprah', 'Winfrey', 'rebellious', 'son', 'who', 'Black', 'Panthers', 'sit-ins', 'naive', 'youngest', 'son', 'who', 'Vietnam', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'experience', 'watch', 'fictionalised', 'persona', 'Cecil', 'Gaines', 'Whitaker', 'based', 'real-life', 'Eugene', 'Allen', 'play', 'so', 'good-to-the-bone', 'inner', 'sadness', 'melancholy', 'character', 'rebellion', 'son', 'negligence', 'wife', 'still', 'strong-minded', 'goodwill', 'something', 'relatively', 'important', 'audiences', 'watch', 'discover.The', 'film', 'also', 'even', 'better', 'comic', 'relief', 'provided', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'played', 'White', 'House', 'server', 'too', 'as', 'well', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'playing', 'smarmy', 'perverted', 'neighbour', 'addition', 'cameos', 'shown', 'film', 'maybe', 'stereotypical', 'are', 'relatively', 'humanising', 'interesting', 'watch', 'especially', 'Liev', 'Schreiber', 'playing', 'catankerous', 'old', 'Lyndon', 'B.', 'Johnson', 'who', 'led', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'playing', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'whilst', 'bizarre', 'accented', 'unusually', 'still', 'funny', 'way', '.Much', 'set', 'designs', 'cinematography', 'editing', 'especially', 'cut-away', 'scenes', 'are', 'well-done', 'constraints', 'budget', 'much', 'relating', 'back', 'what', 'team', 'done', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'bit', 'slightly', 'simplistic', 'narrative', ""n't"", 'bad', 'given', 'Whitaker', 'character', 'tone', 'film', 'missing', 'scene', 'trailer', 'involving', 'Black', 'Panthers', 'shooting', 'police', 'restraint', 'showing', 'horrors', 'carnage', 'whites', 'blacks', 'segregation', 'vague', 'ending.While', 'political', 'piece', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'film', 'was', 'satisfactory', 'enough', 'did', ""n't"", 'falter', 'cracks', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'W.', '2008', 'Dr.', 'Strangelove', 'many', 'young', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'able-minded', 'understand', 'themes', 'ideas', 'being', 'bored', 'history', 'especially', 'rebellious', 'son', 'struggle', 'develop', 'identity.Without', 'remorse', 'film', 'tough', 'material', 'important', 'several', 'levels', 'Unfortunately', 'state', 'affairs', 'today', 'are', 'result', 'much', 'chaos', 'be', 'identity', 'race', 'economic', 'status', 'housing', 'culture', 'labour', 'many', 'people-of-minority', 'who', 'watch', 'film', 'lot', 'questions', 'will', 'be', 'asked', 'doubt', 'inner', 'ambition', 'find', 'liberty', 'non-pressure', 'elsewhere', 'still', 'uncertain', 'one']",N/A

In fact, aside from a few very poor casting choices, the acting was top notch. Still, I can't fathom how anyone thought of casting Mr. Cusack, as President Nixon, and Mr. Rickman, as President Reagan! These are two outstanding men of talent and they were just completely wrong for their parts. The tragedy is there were several other roles in the film where they would have been used to their full potential. I also object to the casting of Mr. Marsden and Ms. Kelly as President and Mrs. Kennedy-Onassis, but they were in it for less than five minutes.Still, despite my imaginary recasting of those four incredibly small roles, the main strike against this movie is how it's put together.If you take it as a series of individual vignettes, then they are all quite superlative. The main trouble is tunnel vision. The writers got so locked down into trying to condense a half century into two hours that none of the momentous events they touch on, get proper treatment, and they skip over events that honestly should have been highlighted such as: The Cuban Missile Crises, The Moon Landing, McCarthy trials, Watergate, and most incomprehensibly... the appointment of Justice Thurgood Marshall to the Supreme Court, were never even acknowledged.I can't help but think that this story would have been better presented as a mini series with each Administration given a two hour episode.My favorite part of the film is when Mr. Gaines in later life observes... that as a society Americans look out in judgment at the world and it's atrocities while ignoring what they have done to their own people. Such a sentiment isn't very popular, but it's truth certainly touched me. Taken as a whole, this country has a grievous list of sins that as a whole we try to sweep under the rug.If nothing else, Mr. Gaines' life exemplifies that despite suffering injustice, tragedy, and heartache one can live a life of dignity and value with hard work and self-respect.

1669540,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B00EV4EUT8,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[105, 135]","Lee Daniels' The Butler is something of a mixed bag. Had it been made twenty years ago, it might have stood on more original ground, but in 2013 it has a highly derivative feel to it, like what you'd get if you crossed Backstairs at the White House (a TV-miniseries from the 1980's that related the real-life experiences of a mother and daughter who worked as maids at the White House over a period of fifty years, starting with the Taft administration and ending with the arrival of JFK) and Forrest Gump where the life of a fictional character seems to cross paths with all the notable figures of his day.It is important to emphasize that in spite of the impression the promotions for The Butler give, this film is in fact fiction. It is supposedly based on the life of a real-life White House butler named Eugene Allen, but other than the fact that Forrest Whitaker's character - a butler named Cecil Gaines - works at the White House for over three decades - almost nothing that happens in the film had anything to do with Allen's actual life.Besides Whitaker's stand-out performance, the supporting cast are quite good as well, from Oprah Winfrey as Gaines' much put-upon boozed-up wife to Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Lenny Kravitz as Cecil's fellow staffers and Terrence Howard as a somewhat too familiar neighbor. David Oyelowo does a creditable job as Cecil's elder son, Louis, who takes the audience through almost every aspect of the black civil rights' experience, from joining the Freedom Riders and participating in sit-in protests at segregated diners to the later Black Panther movement and later still into the rising of black candidates for political office. The script, however, does not leave him a lot of room to be more than a symbolic character for the ear, but Oyelowo does manage to breathe some genuine individuality into the character which helps us to identify with the events he experiences.A major drawback to the film however is the truly bizarre casting of most of the various Presidents of the era. Robin Williams' Eisenhower comes across more as a benign Elmer Fudd than the man who once commanded Allied forces during WWII. James Marsden does a creditable JFK, particularly in a scene where we see him laid out on the floor by the chronic back pain he had to endure through most of his adult life. But Liev Schreiber's LBJ, though he does have a great comic scene as he gives orders to his staff while sitting on the toilet, is badly miscast, employing arguably the worst attempt at a Texas accent ever recorded on film. John Cusack's Nixon is - one presumes - unintentionally hilarious as he slouches about with a fake nose. The film skips over Ford entirely, leading directly into Alan Rickman's Reagan, where you have to wonder ""What _were_ they thinking?"" as Rickman's sole attempt at conveying Reagan was having his hair slicked up. Reagan was British?

Eventually, after his service is noticed by a high-ranking official, Cecil becomes a butler at the White House, serving the Eisenhower-Reagan administrations.  Along the way, Cecil's relationship with his wife Gloria (Oprah Winfrey) and son Louis (David Oyelowo) are the forces that truly define his life.As with all movies about such sensitive topics as civil rights, I was a bit worried going in that ""The Butler"" would be overly preachy.  However, I quickly found that this type of filmmaking is far from that approach.  Director Lee Daniels does indeed delve into some heavy issues, but he pretty much just lays out the situations and lets the viewers themselves decided what to believe.  As with all truly great movies, this is a film about people, first and foremost, and their often complicated interactions with each other.  Yes, civil rights and the White House is the backdrop, but the real strength is the relationships cultivated within it.The acting is also absolutely top-notch.  Each character had a purpose and each actor was able to bring out that purpose in an emotionally form.  For a period piece (though a rather long period), the acting and cinematography make you feel as if you  are truly a part of the action.  One chilling scene involving the KKK will have you almost physically uncomfortable.Overall, ""The Butler"" is one of the better movies I've seen in awhile.  As I was leaving the theater, I was thinking deep thoughts and pondering the many messages it will leave kicking around in your brain.",5,One Of The Better Civil Rights Films In Recent Years,1379116800,"09 14, 2013",2013,1805,"['were', 'history', 'teacher', 'day', 'age', 'job', 'when', 'teaching', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'unit', 'would', 'be', 'oh', 'so', 'simple', 'just', 'cue', 'up', 'Butler', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'movie', 'story', 'Cecil', 'Gaines', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'who', 'young', 'slave', 'craft', 'serving', 'Eventually', 'service', 'noticed', 'high-ranking', 'official', 'Cecil', 'butler', 'White', 'House', 'serving', 'Eisenhower-Reagan', 'administrations', 'way', 'Cecil', 'relationship', 'wife', 'Gloria', 'Oprah', 'Winfrey', 'son', 'Louis', 'David', 'Oyelowo', 'are', 'forces', 'truly', 'define', 'life.As', 'movies', 'such', 'sensitive', 'topics', 'civil', 'rights', 'was', 'bit', 'worried', 'going', 'Butler', 'would', 'be', 'overly', 'preachy', 'However', 'quickly', 'found', 'type', 'filmmaking', 'far', 'approach', 'Director', 'Lee', 'Daniels', 'indeed', 'delve', 'heavy', 'issues', 'pretty', 'much', 'just', 'out', 'situations', 'viewers', 'decided', 'what', 'believe', 'truly', 'great', 'movies', 'film', 'people', 'first', 'foremost', 'often', 'complicated', 'interactions', 'other', 'Yes', 'civil', 'rights', 'White', 'House', 'backdrop', 'real', 'strength', 'relationships', 'cultivated', 'it.The', 'acting', 'also', 'absolutely', 'top-notch', 'character', 'had', 'purpose', 'actor', 'was', 'able', 'bring', 'out', 'purpose', 'emotionally', 'form', 'period', 'piece', 'rather', 'long', 'period', 'acting', 'cinematography', 'make', 'feel', 'are', 'truly', 'part', 'action', 'One', 'chilling', 'scene', 'involving', 'KKK', 'will', 'have', 'almost', 'physically', 'uncomfortable.Overall', 'Butler', 'one', 'better', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'awhile', 'was', 'leaving', 'theater', 'was', 'thinking', 'deep', 'thoughts', 'pondering', 'many', 'messages', 'will', 'leave', 'kicking', 'brain']",N/A
