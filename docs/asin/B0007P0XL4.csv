I've Heared About Of Bad Things About It But Who Cares I Still Want It! Its Just Driving Me Crazy That With All The Techo. Noone Has Ripped It Off DVD And Put It On The Internet.I Was Told That The Aaron Carter ""Popstar"" Movie Is A ""Rip Off"" Of This On. Everyone Had Bad Thoughts Of That Movie Too But I Loved It!

The movie is based around Chris ""posing"" as a normal person to escape the pressures of being part of Dream Street.  Characters are funny, and the movie line is sweet.",5,LOL,1249257600,"08 3, 2009",2009,313,"['Ok', 'movie', 'slightly', 'cheesy', 'BUT', 'purchase', 'were', 'once', 'Dream', 'Street', 'fan', 'and/or', 'idolized', 'Chris', 'Trousdale', 'main', 'star', 'movie', 'based', 'Chris', 'posing', 'normal', 'person', 'escape', 'pressures', 'being', 'part', 'Dream', 'Street', 'Characters', 'are', 'funny', 'movie', 'line', 'sweet']",N/A

Jesse Mccartney (okay everyone knows who he is) is 18 now! who would want to see a few seconds of him in his little pre-teen made band that only little preteen girls knew about  -underage? Creepy. Now Jesse seems to be the only successful one, but the cover of the movie box shows that if Chris continued in the same direction, he should be also very good-looking right now - unlike the other little boys. It wasn't released so long for a reason- if Chris wants a career, he should be focusing on the future and the age he is now. This is clearly ONLY for the little pre-teen fans of dreamstreet whenever they existed.",2,eww - old -but WAY too young...,1121817600,"07 20, 2005",2005,685,"['was', 'SCHEDULED', 'be', 'released', '2001', 'when', 'was', 'filmed', 'Jesse', 'Mccartney', 'everyone', 'knows', 'who', '18', 'now', 'who', 'would', 'want', 'see', 'few', 'seconds', 'little', 'pre-teen', 'made', 'band', 'only', 'little', 'preteen', 'girls', 'knew', '-underage', 'Creepy', 'Now', 'Jesse', 'be', 'only', 'successful', 'one', 'cover', 'movie', 'box', 'Chris', 'continued', 'same', 'direction', 'should', 'be', 'also', 'very', 'good-looking', 'right', 'now', 'other', 'little', 'boys', 'was', ""n't"", 'released', 'so', 'long', 'reason-', 'Chris', 'career', 'should', 'be', 'focusing', 'future', 'age', 'now', 'clearly', 'ONLY', 'little', 'pre-teen', 'fans', 'dreamstreet', 'whenever', 'existed']",N/A

The picture looks like a vhs movie and some scenes (like the dream street concert clips) are worse.  wish they had another company produce the movie.,4,Good movie.
