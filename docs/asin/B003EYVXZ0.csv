1342474,A1LIS4BFMI6C4A,B003EYVXZ0,A. Jasper Rains,"[7, 7]","I have to start off by saying that the production quality of this film is top notch. It reviles most independent movies that Hollywood puts out every year. The acting is fine, The directing is also well done. The script is well thought out and packs a lot of issues into a couple of hours.At first I thought they tried to do too much in too little time. Then I started to think about the teens in my student ministry. I thought about their lives and the hectic pace that this technology driven society forces them to lead. Then I realized that many students today are bombarded by these issues all at once. We like to think that our students are dealing with one problem at a time in a neat little way when truthfully many of them feel like they are being closed in from all sides with major conflict and turmoil all at once. I think this movies speaks to those teens.I have heard concern that the gospel message isn't made crystal clear in the movie. I would agree with that. However, I am not sold on the idea that this film is for the lost. I think that seeking kids can find hope in this film but I came away from it seeing it as a battle cry to Christian teens. I think the moral of the movie is much more about removing ourselves from lukewarm Christianity and actually DOING something than it is about seeking salvation. Jake Taylor's redemption is vital to the story but what he does with that redemption is where the real value lies.Some people will be offended by the suggestive scenes of drinking and sex. Some will be offended by the mild language. I think the producers went right where they needed to go. We got the idea of the life of the teens but I never felt like my mind was taken to places where it didn't need to be. It showed real life. I know because when I was in high school I was immersed in scenes just like those in the movie. I think to ignore that culture is to bury our heads in the Christian bubble of sand.I believe that this film's legacy will be twofold. I think first, it will be known as a movie that inspires students to find hope for themselves as well as point their friends to that hope. I also believe that a line in the sand has been drawn as far as future faith based movies go. I think Newsong pictures has laid down the gauntlet and has proven to us that just because we deem a movie ""Christian"" it does not have to be cheesy. We do not have to put up with sub par acting and production. If you have read my blog at all you know I love the people of Sherwood films. Facing the Giants quite literally was used by God to change my life. I also believe that without their success, To Save A Life may not have been made. They opened doors that were previously closed. Still, I always felt that I had to apologize a bit for the quality of those films. I think To Save A Life will leave us expecting more of a movie. I think in the end that could be very good for Christian media.So, I wholeheartedly endorse this film. Show it to students and parents. I also think the church as a whole can learn from it's message of being authentic. The one area where I am struggling is how to capitalize on the message of the film to see real change in our group. I am praying that God will lead us in that knowledge. The film has opened up avenues for discussion,now the challenge is making it more than just a great film we all saw together.",5,Excellent Film and Resource,1286496000,"10 8, 2010",2010,3371,"['have', 'start', 'off', 'saying', 'production', 'quality', 'film', 'top', 'notch', 'most', 'independent', 'movies', 'Hollywood', 'out', 'year', 'acting', 'fine', 'directing', 'also', 'well', 'done', 'script', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'lot', 'issues', 'couple', 'hours.At', 'first', 'thought', 'tried', 'do', 'too', 'much', 'too', 'little', 'time', 'Then', 'started', 'think', 'teens', 'student', 'ministry', 'thought', 'lives', 'hectic', 'pace', 'technology', 'driven', 'society', 'forces', 'lead', 'Then', 'realized', 'many', 'students', 'today', 'are', 'bombarded', 'issues', 'once', 'like', 'think', 'students', 'are', 'dealing', 'one', 'problem', 'time', 'neat', 'little', 'way', 'when', 'truthfully', 'many', 'feel', 'are', 'being', 'closed', 'sides', 'major', 'conflict', 'turmoil', 'once', 'think', 'movies', 'teens.I', 'have', 'heard', 'concern', 'gospel', 'message', ""n't"", 'made', 'crystal', 'clear', 'movie', 'would', 'agree', 'However', 'am', 'not', 'sold', 'idea', 'film', 'lost', 'think', 'seeking', 'kids', 'can', 'find', 'hope', 'film', 'came', 'away', 'seeing', 'battle', 'cry', 'Christian', 'teens', 'think', 'moral', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'removing', 'lukewarm', 'Christianity', 'actually', 'DOING', 'something', 'seeking', 'salvation', 'Jake', 'Taylor', 'redemption', 'vital', 'story', 'what', 'redemption', 'where', 'real', 'value', 'lies.Some', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'offended', 'suggestive', 'scenes', 'drinking', 'sex', 'will', 'be', 'offended', 'mild', 'language', 'think', 'producers', 'went', 'right', 'where', 'needed', 'go', 'got', 'idea', 'life', 'teens', 'never', 'felt', 'mind', 'was', 'taken', 'places', 'where', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'showed', 'real', 'life', 'know', 'when', 'was', 'high', 'school', 'was', 'immersed', 'scenes', 'just', 'movie', 'think', 'ignore', 'culture', 'bury', 'heads', 'Christian', 'bubble', 'sand.I', 'believe', 'film', 'legacy', 'will', 'be', 'twofold', 'think', 'first', 'will', 'be', 'known', 'movie', 'students', 'find', 'hope', 'as', 'well', 'point', 'friends', 'hope', 'also', 'believe', 'line', 'sand', 'been', 'drawn', 'as', 'far', 'future', 'faith', 'based', 'movies', 'go', 'think', 'Newsong', 'pictures', 'laid', 'down', 'gauntlet', 'proven', 'just', 'deem', 'movie', 'Christian', 'not', 'have', 'be', 'cheesy', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'put', 'up', 'sub', 'par', 'acting', 'production', 'have', 'read', 'blog', 'know', 'love', 'people', 'Sherwood', 'films', 'Facing', 'Giants', 'quite', 'literally', 'was', 'used', 'God', 'change', 'life', 'also', 'believe', 'success', 'Save', 'A', 'Life', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'opened', 'doors', 'were', 'previously', 'closed', 'Still', 'always', 'felt', 'had', 'apologize', 'bit', 'quality', 'films', 'think', 'Save', 'A', 'Life', 'will', 'leave', 'expecting', 'more', 'movie', 'think', 'end', 'could', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'Christian', 'media.So', 'wholeheartedly', 'endorse', 'film', 'Show', 'students', 'parents', 'also', 'think', 'church', 'whole', 'can', 'learn', 'message', 'being', 'authentic', 'one', 'area', 'where', 'am', 'struggling', 'how', 'capitalize', 'message', 'film', 'see', 'real', 'change', 'group', 'am', 'praying', 'God', 'will', 'lead', 'knowledge', 'film', 'opened', 'up', 'avenues', 'discussion', 'now', 'challenge', 'making', 'more', 'just', 'great', 'film', 'saw', 'together']",N/A

Velasquez,"[0, 0]","Now, here's a movie that is different to what we are accustomed to watch these days: no violence, no special effects, and no sex - in short, no commercial appeal for the tastes of this generation. Yet, this is a film that will leave you satisfied and, in some way, will fill a void that perhaps you have in your life. That is, at least, what the honest and precious ""To Save a Life"" did for me.Jake Taylor (Randy Wayne) is a young man that has everything in life: a well-to-do family, a successful promising career in basketball, a scholarship to a prestigious university, and a girlfriend (Deja Kreutzberg). And he also has Roger Dawson (Robert Bailey Jr.), a childhood friend that is like his brother, and once saved his life. However, Jake got mixed with the party crowd, with false values, and abruptly distanced himself from Roger. Things slowly get complicated for Randy, and his world began to crumble once Roger commits suicide. Enter Chris Vaughn (Joshua Weigel), a counselor associated to a church, who offers to help Chris during his struggles with friends and family. Will Jake be able to sort his life out?""To Save a Life,"" directed by Brian Baugh, is about many things, but what I got from it is that we should evaluate our life, and consider the values that are really important, which we tend to forget due to the pressures that life imposes on us, particularly when we are young and at school. Is about helping people in need, because we just don't know when we'll need compassion and understanding. The film clearly has a religious undertone to it, and perhaps it was financed with that purpose. But it really doesn't matter, because this aspect is not imposed on us, and we have to think about the real meaning of the movie.

1342491,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B003EYVXZ0,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[7, 7]","Once in awhile, you catch a film that you find very inspiring and a film that just makes you think and know that there are many kids who are lost, their parents unaware of how their life is going and for many teens, they choose to end it all by taking their own lives.""To Save a Life"" is a film by director Brian Baugh and a screenplay by Jim Britts and a Christian film that was made for around $1,000,000 and earned over $3 million in the box office.  The film is probably the first Christian film that I watched that is PG-13, includes sexual innuendo, drug use, teenage drinking but I felt was a very important step for a Christian film company to break out of the paradigm and showcase how teenagers are these days.This is not a story about preaching about God or a storyline that is in-your-face about why one should change their life for God but it is a film that was created for the sole purpose of helping kids who are seen as outcasts, kids who are in pain and don't know where to turn.  If anything, an inspiring film that shows that today's kids, no matter how rough things are in their personal life, there is always hope.VIDEO:""To Save a Life"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1).  The film features a lot of outdoor school scenes and during those scenes, plenty of vibrant colors and for the most part, the picture quality showcases the detail around the various surroundings.  Skin tone is natural, blacks are nice and deep especially during the night time scenes.  A Blu-ray that features solid visuals and saw no compression artifacting or blemishes.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""To Save a Life"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA.  The dialogue is clear and understandable.  I didn't notice too much of surround usage but there were times of segments with crowd ambiance, so pretty much ""To Save a Life"" is front and center-channel driven.  The film does sport a good amount of music, especially hip hop and rock music.  Bass was nice and deep for the music segments via lossless but for the most part, this film is purely dialogue driven.Subtitles are in English, English SDH and French.SPECIAL FEATURES:""To Save a Life"" comes with the following special features (in HD, English Stereo with English subtitles):* Commentary with Director Brian Baugh, Writer/Co-Producer Jim Britts and Producers Nicole Franco and Steve Foster - Audio commentary by the director, writer and producer with explanation of certain scenes and how they filmed it, working with the various talents for the film and more.* Deleted Scenes - (9:41) A total of eight deleted scenes.* Gag Reel - (5:58) The bloopers and outtakes from the film.* To Save a Life: Behind the Scenes - (12:18) The making of ""To Save a Life"", interviews with the producers, director and cast members.* Music Videos - Featuring two music videos: ""Bounce"" by J-Rus and ""Sunset Cliffs"" by Paul Wright.* Previews - Previews for ""The Karate Kid"", ""Fireproof"" and ""Facing the Giants"".JUDGMENT CALL:""To Save a Life"" is an inspiring film that I hope many parents and their teens will watch and hopefully somehow will make a difference.  May it inspire one to change their life or one to help others who are in need.In today's world, we hear about escalating numbers of teen suicide and even unfortunate and tragic situations that happen in school.  There are far too many children who are hurting and feel they have no other option in their life but to end it.Granted, there are going to be many people who will not accept Christian films and there are many who have a wrong idea of Christian films as stories that are in your face about going to church, accepting God into your life and some may feel that the message and the people who try to get them into religion are being  preachy.  But I can tell you right now, ""To Save a Life"" is not one of those films.Having reviewed my share of Christian films throughout the years, never are these characters depicted as perfect. In fact, many start out as having some troubles in their life but managing to overcome it due to their faith.What makes ""To Save a Life"" so different is that it doesn't preach to anyone.  Nor does this film tell the viewer of what they must do or should do when it comes to God.  But one will notice it's PG-13 rating and its because the film accurately depicts teenage high school life and what happens at these teenage parties or the things that some teenagers do.If anything, ""To Save a Life"" accurately captures teenage life.  May it be from the underage drinking, teenage sex, teenage pregnancy, alcohol and drug use, things that you just don't usually see in a Christian film, let alone a Christian teen film.The characters of Jake the jock, Amy the cheerleader, Doug the jock/party boy, Andrea the teenager who has found Christianity and then the various students who are often alone or seen lower than those who are popular.There is no sugar coating how teenage life is or the peer pressure that exists in this film.  If it happens in real life, the filmmaker, writer and producers wanted to capture that.But the center of this film is the character of Jake Taylor, played by Randy Wayne.  Jake is a guy with a good heart but like many people who excel in sports, you become a jock, you hang out with the athletes and popular people of your school and your old friends, you end up separating away from them.In this case, it hits Jake very hard because not only was he there when his former best friend Roger kills himself, the last few years, he saw Roger being ridiculed because of the way he walks.  An injury that he suffered because he saved Jake's life.  But it's that guilt of not doing anything, not saying anything and it's guilt that hits him hard until it was too late.  This gives Jake a new outlook in life and gives him a new outlook about his current friends, including his relationship with Amy.When Jake meets the youth pastor Chris, Chris doesn't tell him that he must believe in God, nor is he preachy.  He just tells him to show up to the youth classes.  He doesn't have to but he can check it out if he wants.It's that journey of discovering what he really needs in his life is what I found so inspiring and to see how he starts to share his life with others and how it starts to impact their lives positively.Aside from the previously mentioned, teenage activities, It's also important how even at the youth group, there are students that Jake sees at school who are doing drugs and yet come to the youth group classes and in Jake's words ""are fakers"".  To show that problems can happen to all families, no matter what financial status they are.  Even in this film,  the head pastor is unaware of how his own son is a ""faker"" and a stoner.For anyone who has gone to Sunday school or youth class, many teens know that some look at these classes as an excuse to get away from family and hang out with friends at night.  And just because you go to church or a Christian youth group, doesn't mean these kids are perfect Christians because there are kids ""faking it"".  And it was interesting at the same time, was happy to see a film that shows that this does happen.""To Save a Life"" is an inspiring film, an entertaining film and yes, it's  a Christian film.  It's probably one of the better Christian films I have seen in the last two decades.  It was well-written, the acting and the talent were not wooden and if anything, everything seemed to go quite smoothly.So, in many ways, I think a lot of parents and older teenagers can watch this film and possibly be inspired to take a proactive approach in helping those in need.So, overall, I do recommend ""To Save a Life"".  I've read some calling this a ""Christian film disguised as a teenage drama film"".  I'm not sure if disguised is a good word for it but I will say that Christian films are typically not like ""To Save a Life"" but perhaps this is the beginning of something new for Christian filmmaking and if anything, I feel when does this way, accurately depict life as it is, it's easily accessible for those who are not Christians.But granted, I understand if non-Christians will want to stay away from this film but for parents and teenagers who know of teenagers who are hurting, who need some help and need some guidance, I recommend giving ""To Save a Life"" a try.  It's inspirational, dramatic, well-performed and entertaining.A film that is definitely recommended!",4,"Blu-ray: To Save a Life"" is an inspirational film that I can easily recommend to parents and

1342494,A2OKCS5234ZV7S,B003EYVXZ0,Flower,"[0, 0]","This was an excellent movie... I am so glad that Faith based movies are finally getting the attention they need. The message that this movie delivers is awesome and should hit home in many different ways.With bullies in schools and even in the work place, and cliques in schools and the work place, this movie shows just how cruel people can be, and the results that their cruel acts have on others.My family and I viewed this movie on our movie night and this movie was very touching.. I am glad that this movie can be shown to teens, etc as a tool to gain understanding of life and issues that arise in life. The issues that were portrayed in this movie are very real and too many people ignore and make fun of individuals when they are different.This movie shows you how people feel when they are judged by others and what can happen when others are judgmental. This is a great tool for community, church youth groups, summer camps, schools (hopefully they will be allowed to view this movie due to the bulling that is going on in schools and the high teen pregnancies that are going on).This movie covered so many different areas that needed to be covered. This movie can also be used in the juvenile systems and with youth counselors.One person really can make a difference, and that one person can spread positive ways to embrace individuals who are different or who feel left out. You can take a stand and be a voice that is heard. You can lead and not follow.  You can save a life, you can save many lives...Be ready to take a stand after viewing this movie... If you don't stand for something, you will fall for anything.This movie can be used as a grass roots tool to start groups in communities, church, juvenile systems, schools, summer camps, mission trips, sports teams, and any where youth are in attendance and need to be reached. (You can also show this in the work place if it is allowed.. And if it is not, you can tell them about it). You can then have discussion groups and discuss the events of the movie.Life really is important, people are important and do matter. Take time to just listen to our youth of today.. You never know the impact you will have on their life just by showing kindness and having an ear to listen and time to show that  they really do matter.This movie may have had a focus on teens, but really the solutions that this movie offers can be used on all age level groups. Some adults are in the same situation that you will see in this movie.. Look at the news when you see the violence that many adults are involved in... So please take time to view this movie and you to can save a life on any level..Many people really just want to know that they matter and that people see and hear them.. Weather you believe it or not there are many miserable adults in this world and they may display their misery though their actions of how they treat others.When you view this movie, if you are getting it just for teens, take time to view the movie with them. You can learn a lot from this movie as well. This movie covers so many topics.. Even look at the parents and what issues that are going on with them. Many parents are not aware of what is going on with their children they don't see the signs or miss the signs.. This movie will help parents as well. You don't have to be a christian to watch this movie.. This movie is great for all.Rent out the movie theaters, and take your neighborhood teens, youth groups, summer camps to view this movie.. And if you can not do that, then have a big gathering and show this movie.. God moves through out this whole movie.. No one is too young or too old to be on FIRE for the Lord! My children have already said that they are going to go to school and tell all of their friends about this movie.. And we as parents are going to tell all of our friends, family members, co workers etc...It is way cool to show your love for the Lord and to do the right thing when you see people in need or people that are different. I mean really, who are we to pass judgement on others?Well happy viewing! Make a change today and everyday! One person really can make a difference.

Nonetheless, it does a great job of showing what happens in the life of secular school students who get their beliefs mocked and cruelly ridiculed.Unlike how the title sounds, it starts with the funeral of one who's life wasn't saved, but felt it more important to take his own. Why? You discover later on, and the reason should slap the reason popularity is popular. There are many controversial topics tackled, and none of them have the typical easy ""Christian solution"" of prayer then sunshine. It takes a hard look at how hard life is for today's teens, especially today, where people look for any reason bash one another. Depression, self-cutting, drug use, religious hypocrisy, teen social status, partying, basically everything is packed in a not-so-family-friendly packaging. So, why won't it show the easy solution to everything? That's not what this film is about- looking for the easy way out, except for the first victim.So, if you're a Christian and have a problem with the content in this film, remember, this is intended for an audience that would rather laugh in God's own face and tell Him off than ever consider trying to read the Bible.

1342506,A31SSLCKQ9U2XX,B003EYVXZ0,"Jim4God ""Jim4God""","[0, 0]","I really loved this film because I really think it speaks to what a Christian should be especially a Christian in school.  I like that it pointed out the hypocrisy that sometimes infiltrates and overwhelms churches, and it sought to correct that hypocrisy.  However, I do not like the fact that it was pointed out by cursing in church.  I gave another christian movie a really bad rating because there was cursing in the church.  After watching this film, I have had to re-evaluate why I rated that movie so low.  It comes down to this.  The cursing in the other film was done by someone who was supposed to be a Christian who supposedly helped lead back one of her friend's who was a prodigal.  The problem here is that you have a hypocrite leading back a prodigal.  I believe if the blind lead the blind that they both fall into the ditch like the Bible said so I really see no redemption in that movie.  Here you have a person teetering on the edge of becoming a Christian pointing out the hypocrisy in the church by cursing to get their attention then confronting the hypocrisy.  Here in this movie, the cursing did have a redeeming value.  Now don't get me wrong about how much time I am focusing on the cursing, this movie curses very little.  If I remember correctly, it uses two or three words.  I really don't like Christian films cursing; however if they have to have it, I believe it was used appropriately in this movie.  I really wished they would have left it out and just replaced it with someone throwing something or kicking something.  Even Jesus flipped a few tables out of frustration so this fits better in a Christian film in my opinion.  However, this film shows the journey of a young boy from sinner to what I would consider a normal baby Christian.  It also shows the importance of showing the love of God to those who normally would not be shown love by the world.  Overall, I would recommend the movie to most youth pastors and youth groups; however beware of the few curse words, I know some Christians don't want to allow anything like that around their youth.  If you really want to watch it without the cursing, you might be able to pick up a curse word blocker like tv guardian or guardian angel to block out the few words that it does have.

What a beautiful combination of faith and cinema.  For those who enjoy Christian films likeFlywheelorFireproof, this is an excellent addition to that genre.  Unfortunately, many of these films seem to be quite low budget and have a very handmade feel to them.  This one has a taste of that, but is most professional both in the writing and editing of the feature.  Director Brian Baugh who is primarily known as a cinematographer did an amazing job of keeping the pacing and bringing out performances from his mostly young cast.  The lead of Jake is played by Randy Wayne who has been in the TV version of ""Dukes of Hazzard"" and done television shows as diverse as ""The Closer"" & ""True Blood.""  The blond actor has an infectious smile and is believable as a popular high school athlete whose world changes dramatically.  From his abandonment of his best friend so that he can be with the ""cool"" kids, we see him become a party animal.  With his friend's suicide, it takes him on a journey where he realizes that true happiness and peace of mind come from caring about others and being a true friend.  His girlfriend in the film Amy Briggs is played by Deja Kreutzberg who did a number of episodes on the soap ""As the World Turns.""  Doug Moore, Jake's friend who urges him to drink and be cool, is played well by Steven Crowder.  Sean Michael Afable plays Jonny Garcia whose ""cutting"" scene made me squirm in my seat.  Bubba Lewis plays the preacher's kid who pulls about every mean trick in the book.  Joshua Weigel who recently won an award from Clint Eastwood for a short film does a wonderful job as the youth pastor Chris.  His caring and willingness to go the second mile for even those outside his church holds the spiritual heart of the film together.  ""To Save a Life"" does not flinch when bringing up topics such as drug abuse, alcohol use & sex that young people must navigate their way through.  However, the end of the journey is inspiring and emphasizes that one person with God can make a difference.

While surfing though the internet I came across this movie in someone's list. I borrowed it from our library and was moved by the subject and way of handling of some of very sensitive issues the young generation is going through. We read a lot about teen suicide, teen killing others in school.... but never try to understand what was happening in that person's mind. This movie very tactfully addressed most of those issues. The best part is that it has a solution. Unlike most movies which ask questions and leave the audience to answer those, this movie has shown how we all can be of small help to others and might SAVE A LIFE. The movie might be categorized as a Christian movie, but it was never too preachy. I respect every religion; I believe every person has the rite to follow whatever he or she believe, as long we are doing something good to make the world a better place to stay. We all need the Higher Power to guide us when we are lost. This movie has moved me so much that I purchased the Bluray and promised to first improve my life and try to SAVE A LIFE (at least).

1342530,A1IMGIEFQQFFNH,B003EYVXZ0,Tommy,"[18, 26]","By now you have probably heard of the movie To Save a Life, which opened nation-wide in theaters on January 22nd. The movie deals with so many issues that teens face today, like suicide, cutting, drinking, drugs, premarital sex, teen pregnancy, and abortion. At first glance this movie looks like an awesome resource that we should recommend for our teens, parents, youth pastors, and youth workers.But a closer look at the movie reveals a few disturbing things. For starters, according to pluggedin.com, there are 2 uses of the ""A"" word, 5 uses of hell (used as a curse word), and once the ""D"" word is used. There are other crude terms used to describe a girl, and crude terms for referring to sexual activity. There is also a bedroom scene that shows a girl removing a boy's shirt, then afterwards the girl putting her shirt back on.I know the arguments in favor of this movie. I realize that the curse words are before the young man gives his life to Christ, and I know that the bedroom scene is essential to the storyline.The movie's writer, who is a youth pastor in California, said that he prayed over every curse word he wrote into the script. While he admitted that cussing ""is not cool,"" he added that those words helped to make the story real. I have to take issue with this (here comes the part where I get called a Pharisee and legalist again). Where do we read in the Gospels that Jesus used curse words to appeal to those ""real people"" around Him? Where do we see Him stealing to reach the tax collectors, kicking people around to reach the Roman centurions, or bragging about Himself to reach the Pharisees? Obviously He did not do those things; instead we see Jesus transcending culture and urging people to change their lives and follow Him.As followers of Jesus we are told to be light to the darkness, salt to the earth, and a city on a hill. What will really reach people is Christians living a different life, not doing what Casting Crowns sings about, ""blending in so well that people can't see the difference, and it's the difference that sets the world free.""Ironically, one of the elements in this movie is hypocrisy in the church. How is it not hypocrisy to live by the Bible that says to be separate from the world, then make a movie with profanity in it? A movie about hypocrisy is being hypocritical.About the curse words, the movie's producer said that kids hear much worse all the time. That is a terrible way of justifying sin. The reason many people, youth pastors included, don't have a problem with 8 curse words in a movie is they are already watching movies and TV shows that use much worse language. If you have no problem watching and talking about sitcoms that use cursing and taking God's Name in vain and movies that will use F-bombs and gd's, then there is certainly no problem with a few of the ""lighter curse words."" The same point can also be made for all the sexual innuendo on TV.I know the bedroom scene sets up a crucial part of the storyline, and I know that many people are praising the movie for not showing too much, but in my opinion (here comes more legalist accusations) it does show too much. Can a young man's mind not wander and continue to play out the scene in his mind? Can the image of the young lady putting her shirt back on (while the young man says, ""Let's do it again. You know you want to."") not cause a student to lust?While this movie can and will be used to compel many teens to look out for the outcasts in their school, I still see it as a wasted opportunity, as the movie's writer admitted that he did not intend to make a Christian movie, and that this movie does not ""share the faith.""I have and do endorse movies, but I will not endorse a movie that can cause a student to fall into sin. Youth pastors, just imagine that one of your students goes home and uses the ""A"" word in front of his mother.""Where did you learn to talk like that?""""It was in that movie that Pastor ___________ took us to see.""But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to stumble, it would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck, and he were thrown into the sea.--Jesus, Mark 9:42To save a life, I will not endorse To Save a Life.",1,"A ""Christian"" movie with 8 cuss words and a bedroom scene?",1349049600,"10 1, 2012",2012,4221,"['now', 'have', 'probably', 'heard', 'movie', 'Save', 'Life', 'opened', 'nation-wide', 'theaters', 'January', '22nd', 'movie', 'deals', 'so', 'many', 'issues', 'face', 'today', 'suicide', 'cutting', 'drinking', 'drugs', 'premarital', 'sex', 'teen', 'pregnancy', 'abortion', 'first', 'glance', 'movie', 'awesome', 'resource', 'should', 'recommend', 'teens', 'parents', 'youth', 'pastors', 'youth', 'workers.But', 'closer', 'look', 'movie', 'few', 'disturbing', 'things', 'starters', 'according', 'pluggedin.com', 'are', '2', 'uses', 'A', 'word', '5', 'uses', 'hell', 'used', 'curse', 'word', 'once', 'D', 'word', 'used', 'are', 'other', 'crude', 'terms', 'used', 'describe', 'girl', 'crude', 'terms', 'referring', 'sexual', 'activity', 'also', 'bedroom', 'scene', 'girl', 'removing', 'boy', 'shirt', 'then', 'girl', 'putting', 'shirt', 'back', 'on.I', 'know', 'arguments', 'favor', 'movie', 'realize', 'curse', 'words', 'are', 'young', 'man', 'life', 'Christ', 'know', 'bedroom', 'scene', 'essential', 'storyline.The', 'movie', 'writer', 'who', 'youth', 'pastor', 'California', 'said', 'prayed', 'over', 'curse', 'word', 'wrote', 'script', 'admitted', 'cussing', 'not', 'cool', 'added', 'words', 'helped', 'make', 'story', 'real', 'have', 'take', 'issue', 'here', 'part', 'where', 'get', 'called', 'Pharisee', 'legalist', 'again', 'Where', 'do', 'read', 'Gospels', 'Jesus', 'used', 'curse', 'words', 'appeal', 'real', 'people', 'Him', 'Where', 'do', 'see', 'Him', 'stealing', 'reach', 'tax', 'collectors', 'kicking', 'people', 'reach', 'Roman', 'centurions', 'bragging', 'Himself', 'reach', 'Pharisees', 'Obviously', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'things', 'instead', 'see', 'Jesus', 'transcending', 'culture', 'urging', 'people', 'change', 'lives', 'follow', 'Him.As', 'followers', 'Jesus', 'are', 'told', 'be', 'light', 'darkness', 'salt', 'earth', 'city', 'hill', 'What', 'will', 'really', 'reach', 'people', 'Christians', 'living', 'different', 'life', 'not', 'doing', 'what', 'Casting', 'Crowns', 'sings', 'blending', 'so', 'well', 'people', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'difference', 'difference', 'world', 'free', 'Ironically', 'one', 'elements', 'movie', 'hypocrisy', 'church', 'How', 'not', 'hypocrisy', 'live', 'Bible', 'be', 'separate', 'world', 'then', 'make', 'movie', 'profanity', 'movie', 'hypocrisy', 'being', 'curse', 'words', 'movie', 'producer', 'said', 'kids', 'hear', 'much', 'worse', 'time', 'terrible', 'way', 'justifying', 'sin', 'reason', 'many', 'people', 'youth', 'pastors', 'included', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', '8', 'curse', 'words', 'movie', 'are', 'already', 'watching', 'movies', 'TV', 'shows', 'use', 'much', 'worse', 'language', 'have', 'problem', 'watching', 'talking', 'sitcoms', 'use', 'cursing', 'taking', 'God', 'Name', 'vain', 'movies', 'will', 'use', 'F-bombs', 'gd', 'then', 'certainly', 'problem', 'few', 'lighter', 'curse', 'words', 'same', 'point', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'made', 'sexual', 'innuendo', 'TV.I', 'know', 'bedroom', 'scene', 'up', 'crucial', 'part', 'storyline', 'know', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'praising', 'movie', 'not', 'showing', 'too', 'much', 'opinion', 'here', 'more', 'legalist', 'accusations', 'show', 'too', 'much', 'Can', 'young', 'man', 'mind', 'not', 'wander', 'continue', 'play', 'out', 'scene', 'mind', 'Can', 'image', 'young', 'lady', 'putting', 'shirt', 'back', 'young', 'man', 'Let', 'do', 'again', 'know', 'want', 'not', 'cause', 'student', 'lust', 'movie', 'can', 'will', 'be', 'used', 'compel', 'many', 'teens', 'look', 'out', 'outcasts', 'school', 'still', 'see', 'wasted', 'opportunity', 'movie', 'writer', 'admitted', 'did', 'not', 'intend', 'make', 'Christian', 'movie', 'movie', 'not', 'share', 'faith', 'have', 'do', 'endorse', 'movies', 'will', 'not', 'endorse', 'movie', 'can', 'cause', 'student', 'fall', 'sin', 'Youth', 'pastors', 'just', 'imagine', 'one', 'students', 'home', 'A', 'word', 'front', 'mother', 'Where', 'did', 'learn', 'talk', 'was', 'movie', 'Pastor', '___________', 'took', 'see', 'whoever', 'one', 'little', 'ones', 'who', 'believe', 'Me', 'stumble', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'millstone', 'were', 'hung', 'neck', 'were', 'thrown', 'sea.', 'Jesus', 'Mark', '9:42To', 'save', 'life', 'will', 'not', 'endorse', 'Save', 'Life']",N/A
