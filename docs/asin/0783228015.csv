Jane Seymour plays this theater actress so well.  Christopher Reeve is excellent as a man captivated so much by the woman's mere photo and his passion for this actress makes him want to go absolutely anywhere to meet her and this  drives the story. She and Christopher Reeve have great chemistry and the location is also irresistible as much of the film was shot on location at the Grand Hotel in Michigan on Mackinac Island.  I heard that Christopher Reeve would take Jane Seymour on plane rides there as well during breaks in filming....wonderful film!,5,Apparently it didn't work in the Gazebo with Maria so Christopher Plummer found Elise Makenna then Christopher Reeve does too!,1398297600,"04 24, 2014",2014,680,"['will', 'love', 'film', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'great', '34', 'agent', '34', 'guard', 'very', 'successful', 'Elise', 'Makenna', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'theater', 'actress', 'so', 'well', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'excellent', 'man', 'captivated', 'so', 'much', 'woman', 'mere', 'photo', 'passion', 'actress', 'want', 'go', 'absolutely', 'anywhere', 'meet', 'story', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'have', 'great', 'chemistry', 'location', 'also', 'irresistible', 'much', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'location', 'Grand', 'Hotel', 'Michigan', 'Mackinac', 'Island', 'heard', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'would', 'take', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'plane', 'rides', 'there', 'as', 'well', 'breaks', 'filming', '.wonderful', 'film']",N/A

If you don't agree with me, then, as my Italian grandmother one memorably uttered after an entire evening of watching ""Welcome Back Kotter"" reruns on Nick at Nite, ""Uppa you nose-a with a rubber-a hose-a.""But more importantly -- I have a real soft spot for this movie.  It's a little over the top, and doesn't always make sense, but that's why people like this kind of story. The music is like the soundtrack to ""Doctor Zhivago"" on steroids. Jane Seymour gets plenty of opportunities to do that signature smile of hers, with the curling lip. Anyway, the plot is a little thin, but I think that's one of this movie's strong points, actually. It is impossible to be distracted from the romance of it, because the romance is all the movie has to offer.A friend once pointed out to me the issue of the golden watch. When was it actually created?? She gives it to him in the present, but the only reason she has the watch is that he gave it to her in the past. Then again, the only reason HE had it in the past is that she gave it to him in the present. What does it all mean?

Seeing cars on the scene was odd since they are not permitted on the Island. In any case, this movie seems to be a cult favorite. I have seen it twice and was left wanting more each time. The acting isn't bad, but the storyline seems to leave a lot of gaps. The whole time travel premise is kind of flimsy, but in movies like this you sort of have to suspend disbelief. Thankfully the movie doesn't dwell too heavily on the time travel setup. What bothered me is that it seems like there were so many possibilities left unrealized with the plot. It seems very unbelievable that the two characters would fall in love so easily and quickly. There seems to be little basis for it. This is another one of those romantic movies in which the male character is charming, but basically appears on the scene as a stalker and yet the female character falls for him anyway.

My imagination can be overloaded with thoughts of time travel; it fires me more than almost any other type of fantasy we see in performing arts.  In this case when it is combined with a love story that is about love and not dysfunction, it mesmerizes me.There are a couple of things that get me.  I love the paradox of the watch Elise gives Richard in the opening scene.  Where did it come from?  Frankly it would have been a disappointment if the author had decided to explain his truth of it. (If he had one)Another is, (well first I will say that when I saw the picture of Elise I thought that it certainly was a face to inspire time travel),  that the look in her photo is because she sees Richard so it makes even more sense that he fell in love at that point.I guess a confession on my part is necessary.  I am afraid to think too hard on what I would give for love like that.  For a love that causes a woman to say my name the way Elise says Richards when she had thought she lost him.  Maybe many men won't admit it but I believe that real deep love is what we all crave, and certainly that is true for me.If you have not seen this, watch it.If you are a man and are going to have a date at home with a woman, watch this.When the world is crap, when the news has worn you down, when you wonder if you will ever again see a movie that suspends completely the real world and draws you into true escape, watch this.Enough of my inarticulate drivel.

I sat through the film spellbound by the beautiful scenery and sincere acting. Critics in 1980 (when the theatre-run movie first opened) did not like it nor could they understand why anyone else would. At the time I was only 12, at an ""impressionable"" age where B movie fare such as ""Xanadu"" and ""Grease 2"" made me ooh and ah. Twenty-two years later, I still love this romantic fantasy as much as ever, even though I tend to go for more mind-bending work such as ""Mulholland Drive.""What the critics don't get and what is just plain wonderful is that ""Somewhere in Time"" no longer carries a ""bad movie stigma.""  The Richard Matheson-scripted film enjoys a strong following among people who love lavish cinematography and lush film scores. Quirky movie guides often list ""Somewhere in Time"" as a must-see. You don't need a book or a critic, though, when you've got that magic feeling you get from this Jeannot Szwarc-directed piece. Movies today may be a lot smarter, charge your brain better and depict our often cruel world with frightening clarity, but can you honestly remember the last time your heart was tugged at with gooey-free innocence and yearning? If not, give ""Somwhere in Time"" a chance.Many who enjoy Christopher Reeve's varied film career cite ""Superman"" as the work that made them take notice. For me, it was his role as the good-hearted Richard Collier who goes the distance for true love and is unwilling to face its loss. Jane Seymour, the 80s tv-miniseries darling and now a beloved celebrity, proved she could lend an understated touch to her acting and a modesty that suited the 1910 setting of ""Somewhere in Time.""",5,The first movie that stole my heart,1097712000,"10 14, 2004",2004,2251,"['Pocket-size', 'plot', 'summary', 'Boy', 'girl', 'old', 'photo', 'early', '1900s', 'Boy', 'meet', 'girl', 'so', 'back', 'time', 'meets', 'girl', 'girl', 'rest', 'up', 'discover', 'WARNING', 'movie', 'faint', 'heart', 'who', 'weep', 'openly', 'will', 'cry', 'so', 'get', 'tissues', 'out', 'now', 'No', 'shame', 'need', 'be', 'involved', 'will', 'remind', 'joys', 'sorrows', 'being', 'love', 'might', 'need', 'little', 'aspirin', 'paradoxes', 'time', 'travel', 'what', 'fun', 'tissues', 'getting', 'completely', 'soaked', 'Back', '1982', 'Somewhere', 'Time', 'aired', 'network', 'television', 'sat', 'film', 'spellbound', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'sincere', 'acting', 'Critics', '1980', 'when', 'theatre-run', 'movie', 'first', 'opened', 'did', 'not', 'could', 'understand', 'why', 'anyone', 'else', 'would', 'time', 'was', 'only', '12', 'impressionable', 'age', 'where', 'B', 'movie', 'fare', 'such', 'Xanadu', 'Grease', '2', 'made', 'ooh', 'ah', 'Twenty-two', 'years', 'later', 'still', 'love', 'romantic', 'fantasy', 'as', 'much', 'ever', 'even', 'tend', 'go', 'more', 'mind-bending', 'work', 'such', 'Mulholland', 'Drive', 'What', 'critics', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'what', 'just', 'plain', 'wonderful', 'Somewhere', 'Time', 'no', 'longer', 'bad', 'movie', 'stigma', 'Richard', 'Matheson-scripted', 'film', 'strong', 'following', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'lavish', 'cinematography', 'lush', 'film', 'scores', 'Quirky', 'movie', 'guides', 'often', 'list', 'Somewhere', 'Time', 'must-see', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'book', 'critic', 'though', 'when', ""'ve"", 'got', 'magic', 'feeling', 'get', 'Jeannot', 'Szwarc-directed', 'piece', 'Movies', 'today', 'may', 'be', 'lot', 'smarter', 'charge', 'brain', 'better', 'depict', 'often', 'cruel', 'world', 'frightening', 'clarity', 'can', 'honestly', 'remember', 'last', 'time', 'heart', 'was', 'tugged', 'gooey-free', 'innocence', 'yearning', 'not', 'give', 'Somwhere', 'Time', 'chance.Many', 'who', 'enjoy', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'varied', 'film', 'career', 'cite', 'Superman', 'work', 'made', 'take', 'notice', 'was', 'role', 'good-hearted', 'Richard', 'Collier', 'who', 'distance', 'true', 'love', 'unwilling', 'face', 'loss', 'Jane', 'Seymour', '80s', 'tv-miniseries', 'darling', 'now', 'beloved', 'celebrity', 'proved', 'could', 'lend', 'understated', 'touch', 'acting', 'modesty', 'suited', '1910', 'setting', 'Somewhere', 'Time']",N/A

I used to do it frequently when I was a teenager, and I guess I never concentrated enough, because I never quite made it to the Red Planet.Well here Christopher Reeve tries and then tries again, to go back to 1912 to be with the every-lovely Jane Seymour, a noted actress from that period. Somehow he succeeds. Bravo on behalf of all romantics and science fiction fans out there!Her manager tries to quench the hot and growing romance between these two,but he not only has to compete with their desire, but with the stately historic hotel in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, and all its trappings. Kind of like the Chicago Cubs trying to get to a World Series.Anyway, see the movie, buy it and cherish it.

I don't pretend to understand it, not really, but it's a love story and a time travel story.Richard Collier (Christopher Reeve) was a beginning playwright in 1972, and had just written a very good play that was produced at his college, and being scouted for a possible run on Broadway. Suddenly, a very dignified old lady walks out of the shadows, hands him a gift, and whispers to him ""Come back to me."" The gift is an old-fashioned gold watch.Eight years later, he's a successful playwright being pressured by his agent for the play he said he was writing, and decides to go to the Grand Hotel, the fine old resort near where he went to college. When it turns out he has some time to kill before the dining room opens, he goes into a little museum room the hotel maintains. There on the wall, in an ornate frame, is a photograph of Elise McKenna (Jane Seymour) that mesmerizes him. So instead of going back to the city, he stays at the Grand and researches Miss McKenna. Turns out she was a famous actress who had played there in 1912. She went on to have a great career, but she was new and not much known at that time.I won't detail the mechanism, but Collier manages to travel back in time to 1912, still at the Grand Hotel, and meets Elise. They fall in love. Of course he never told her he was from the future, and indeed subsequent events suggest he did not know it during that time.But William Robinson (Christopher Plummer), her manager, knows something. And has prophesied that some day she will meet a man who changes her life. So when she meets Collier, she says ""Is it you?"" And while she may or may not recognize him, he recognizes her, and says ""Yes.""There are many charming touches, the costumes and sets are marvelous, and it's basically a love story with a unique twist. One important twist is how he ended up returning to the present time. So I won't spoil that for you.BTW, Christopher Reeve really was a very handsome, very competent actor in those days.

Intrigued, he starts to do some research and discovers that the woman was, in her youth, a beautiful and popular stage actress named Elise McKenna. He travels to a resort where she had performed, and becomes obsessed with a photographic portrait he sees on display there. (Next comes the really fantasy part) He decides he has to learn how he can travel back in time so that he may meet her, and by self-hypnosis, combined with other methods/props, they meet and fall in love. But trouble rears its ugly head in the form of Elise's overbearing and overprotective manager (Plummer).Christopher Reeve is at his handsome prime here, and his performance is wonderfully Gary Cooperish-tall-awkward-naive-in love.

This heartfelt, innocent, and altogether gentle motion picture explores that question exceedingly well.Based upon Richard Matheson's simalarly themed ""Bid Time Return,"" this is a unique fantasy that takes us into the life of Richard Collier. Collier, performed with great passion by the late Christopher Reeve, has just come off a successful debut performance of his most recent play in 1972. Friends and colleagues congratulate him in a post reception-style party, where he crosses paths with a most extraordinary old woman. She approaches from the abandoned back half of the party hall, handing him an exquisite gold watch on a chain, and says: ""Come back to me."" The story then shifts eight years ahead to 1980. Collier is now living in Chicago, his play writing has come to a standstill, and his love life is near non-existent. So, he decides to pack up and go away for a holiday to collect his thoughts. His travels take him to the posh Grand Hotel on Michigan's luxurious Mackinac Island where, upon entering the hotel's spacious Hall of History, he discovers a vintage portrait of the most beautiful woman he has ever seen. Transfixed by her astonishing beauty, he proceeds to uncover everything he can about her. This information reveals that she is, infact, the very same woman who came to him years before with the gold watch. This, of course, is where the real story begins. It branches off into borderline science fiction as Collier develops a manner of willing himself back through time to 1912, the very year this woman performed in a play at the same hotel.Various critics, it goes without saying, have attacked this film for being too superficial and corny. I, like many others it would appear, do not share in that sentiment. This is a beautiful and staggeringly emotional film. Much like ""The Bridges of Madison County,"" another movie I have reviewed here, ""Somewhere In Time"" is a movie that melts my heart with each and every viewing. It's the sort of film that reminds us just how powerful the emotion of love can be. You have Christopher Reeve portraying a man who gives up the life he has in the present to start a new one in the past with a woman he feels nothing but the utmost affection for. How patently romantic is that?I have been recommending this wonderful film to just about every single person I know, and for good reason. This is the sort of romance that Hollywood just cannot seem to harness in dramas today.

Specifically, I don't think I would have liked it.That said I did like this movie very much.  Somewhere in Time is based on the novel Bid Time Adieu by Richard Matheson.  The book is now titled Somewhere in Time because of the popularity of the movie.For those not familiar with either: Richard Collier is a 36-year old writer who falls in love with a beautiful actress - Elise McKenna. But there's one big problem. She's dead. She lived years ago in another time. But that doesn't stop Richard who figures out a way to travel back in time and win her heart.  And that is basically all there is to the plot, a romantic love story between two misplaced souls.The movie is very well written and is, for the most part, true to the book.  Of course Richard Matheson, the book's author, wrote the screenplay so that isn't surprising.  The good thing about the movie is it moves along at a reasonably nice pace and the mood it evokes is very much like the book - a nostalgic setting and ethereal romance.  The lighting, the pace, the set, and the very good acting make the move work.The stars of the movie were the late Christopher Reeves - whose unruly hair and kind of stiff but gangly bigness make Richard Collier a likeable goof.  Jane Seymour was fabulous as Elise McKenna.

Ms. Seymour is quite simply a vision of loveliness and a woman most men can only dream of. I believe Ms. Seymour is not only at her most beautiful in this film but, as an actress, totally in her element.  The setting is pure old school grandeur and uses the magnificent Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island in Michigan as its setting.  The hotel and grounds are nothing short of perfect for the premise and purpose of this film. A current day playwright is celebrating his success as a playwright and is taken aback when a very old woman approaches him. She says only four words to him...&#34;Come back to me!&#34; presses a beautiful pocket watch into his hand and then, she is gone.  He has no idea who she is or what it is she is referring to at that moment.  Some years go by and his success has both exhausted and given him a severe case of writer's block. Deadlines are fast approaching and he decides to flee the city and give his mind a well needed rest.  He heads out in his car to points unknown and along the road he sees a sign for The Grand Hotel and decides to stop there...at least for the night.  After registering, and having little to do, he goes about the hotel and discovers a room off the lobby which is set up as a memorial to the great plays of yesteryear once performed there. It seems the hotel once had a theater that was very popular in its day and a portrait of the actress around whom this display is geared is on the far wall. As he walks toward it, he is instantly mesmerized and drawn to her.  He looks at all the artifacts preserved in that room and comes across another photograph of someone he actually recognizes!  It is the old woman who approached him that night so many years ago and it is attached to the obituary of the actress whose portrait is on that wall. The beautiful woman in the portrait and the older woman are one and the same person.  She had died later on very night she had spoken to him!  He locates the manager of the hotel and begins to ask questions about her, why this room has so much significance and what it's all about.  Having grown up in the hotel himself, he explains who she was and what she meant to the era and the hotel itself.  He tells him that the actresses companion is still alive and living nearby.  He decides to pay her a visit to see what else he can discover and when he does the woman is a bit reticent in revealing too much about her until he shows her the watch he has in his pocket!  What ensues is the stuff great stories are made of and the point of this entire movie.

60458,A3OEECMCM2T4KQ,0783228015,C. Middleton,"[4, 4]","For many this film takes the notion of ""soul mates"" and pushes it to extremes. We've all experienced at one time or another a ""first love"". It usually happens in our adolescence, this special relationship may last only weeks and sometimes years, but inevitably, it fades for a variety of reasons, though years can pass, and the thought of them returns when we least expect it - a conversation, a stranger at a restaurant or a song on the radio, all these things can spark their memory. What if there was a way to actually return to that time and see them again as they were...? What if a total stranger approaches you and gives you something, a memento, and asks you to come back to them? Only later you discover a photo of that person and feel with all your heart that you know them. You've never actually met them before, but you just `know' that you've met them somewhere, and you would do anything to see them again.Somewhere in Time is a fantasy that takes this notion of ""lost loves' and turns it into reality. Our protagonist meets his soul mate and becomes so obsessed with seeing her again, that he actually transverses time and space in order to accomplish this. He succeeds, but there's always a catch. This is a sentimental tale that makes no apologies for being so, it is what it is, and maybe that's why it has retained its appeal for so many people over so many years.The late Christopher Reeves does a fantastic job as the besotted time traveller - a naive, bumbling writer in love with a woman who existed before he was born. He delivers a wonderful performance at that moment when he finally goes back in time. His reaction is nothing less than perfect. When he sees his lost love for the first time at the hotel, the romantic soundtrack flowing in the background, the majority of us set our cynicism aside, and feel the protagonist's excitement and awe... I suppose that is one of the keys to watching this sentimental film, suspending our propensity for cynicism, our world-weariness, and relating to these people whose love for each other knows no bounds.Chris Reeves will always be remembered as Superman, but for me, this performance as the besotted time traveller in search of his lost love, will always stand out as one of his greatest performances.",5,"""Come back to me.""",1100304000,"11 13, 2004",2004,2274,"['many', 'film', 'notion', 'soul', 'mates', 'extremes', ""'ve"", 'experienced', 'one', 'time', 'first', 'love', 'usually', 'adolescence', 'special', 'relationship', 'may', 'last', 'only', 'weeks', 'sometimes', 'years', 'inevitably', 'variety', 'reasons', 'years', 'can', 'pass', 'thought', 'returns', 'when', 'least', 'expect', 'conversation', 'stranger', 'restaurant', 'song', 'radio', 'things', 'can', 'spark', 'memory', 'What', 'was', 'way', 'actually', 'return', 'time', 'see', 'again', 'were', 'What', 'total', 'stranger', 'approaches', 'something', 'memento', 'come', 'back', 'Only', 'later', 'discover', 'photo', 'person', 'feel', 'heart', 'know', ""'ve"", 'never', 'actually', 'met', 'just', 'know', ""'ve"", 'met', 'somewhere', 'would', 'do', 'anything', 'see', 'again.Somewhere', 'Time', 'fantasy', 'notion', 'lost', 'loves', 'reality', 'protagonist', 'meets', 'soul', 'mate', 'so', 'obsessed', 'seeing', 'again', 'actually', 'time', 'space', 'order', 'accomplish', 'always', 'catch', 'sentimental', 'tale', 'apologies', 'being', 'so', 'what', 'maybe', 'why', 'retained', 'appeal', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'so', 'many', 'years.The', 'late', 'Christopher', 'Reeves', 'fantastic', 'job', 'besotted', 'time', 'traveller', 'naive', 'bumbling', 'writer', 'love', 'woman', 'who', 'existed', 'was', 'born', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'moment', 'when', 'finally', 'back', 'time', 'reaction', 'nothing', 'less', 'perfect', 'When', 'lost', 'love', 'first', 'time', 'hotel', 'romantic', 'soundtrack', 'flowing', 'background', 'majority', 'set', 'cynicism', 'aside', 'feel', 'protagonist', 'excitement', 'awe', 'suppose', 'one', 'keys', 'watching', 'sentimental', 'film', 'suspending', 'propensity', 'cynicism', 'world-weariness', 'relating', 'people', 'love', 'other', 'bounds.Chris', 'Reeves', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'remembered', 'Superman', 'performance', 'besotted', 'time', 'traveller', 'search', 'lost', 'love', 'will', 'always', 'stand', 'out', 'one', 'greatest', 'performances']",N/A

I'm not usually a big fan of romance stories, but this one has always moved me, maybe because, as another reviewer points out, it's from the man's point of view.The film is a wonderful old-fashioned type of story with a really nice feel for the period (1912) and is simply a pleasant, leisurely-paced story I found comfortable. Would kids of today like this? No. Too slow for them. Too bad, because I found the movie moved pretty well. The 100 minutes went by quickly.Christopher Reeve is the star of the film but personally I found Jane Seymour and Christopher Plummer far more entertaining. The theme song, ""Somewhere In Time,"" is one of the prettiest songs ever and that adds to the sad and frustrating romance angle of the story. The language also is quite tame. Yes, it's a bit ""sappy"" at times, but for sentimental people, this is a nice film to keep.My only real complaint is I've never seen a sharp transfer put on a DVD yet. There have been two DVDs out and both have that grainy look to them. That's disappointing because this would really look nice with a clear picture.

Star Wars&#34;. &#34;Halloween&#34; was my favorite horror movie, them among other Sci-fi, action, and horror genres, and I still somehow managed to get the meaning and feel for this movie, that so many others have gotten out of it, that has made it a true cult classic survivor.An absolute flop at the box office, it was dismissed by the critics, as being riddled with loose ends, and loop holes. However, cable tv, and video rentals, just breathed a new life into this movie, and now we have it in the best format possible(for now). Like any Blu-ray movies that I have seen and own, it is like watching it for the first time. It just pulls you in, with so many details that were impossible to notice before. Only noticed a bit of grain as the older Elise, is looking out her bedroom window, on the night that she dies. The sound is not very good throughout the film. It's a bit hollow and thin. No surround at all. It's not the worst sound I have heard, I just think it was the best they could do with a low budget, mono sound released in the theatres.I can say so much more about this movie, but I would just be repeating what many others have said throughout the years, so I will just say that I'm very pleased with the Blu-ray release which has just come out.

60470,A3QY9AN12M8P8N,0783228015,"David B. Jaromnak ""djaromnak""","[92, 93]","Somewhere in Time is an excellent film that combines Time Travel with romance, using an interesting and unique idea involving hypnotizing your mind to believe you are actually in that moment in history.  If you can avoid analyzing the rationality of time travel and suspend your disbelief, this film will be very enjoyable for you.  The idea of travelling back through time to find your soulmate is something both men and women can believe in.  It is to the credit of the performances of the leads, Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour, that the viewer believes that such a thing is possible.  Reeve and Seymour also look well together and have obvious chemistry, making their love affair entirely believable. Especially with their first kiss, there is a deep and passionate love that seems entirely real. The third element is the acting of Christopher Plummer, who is always excellent and quite effective here as the overprotective manager of Seymour's character.  But, there are two more elements that contributes greatly to the atmposhere of the film - the moving music composed by John Barry, and the Grand Hotel where most of the movie is set.  The handsome and expressive Reeve, the calm beauty of Seymour, the brooding and calculating Plummer, the romantic and moving music and the timeless presence of the Grand Hotel combine into a magical film for the hopeless romantic.DVD Comments:  Compared to reference DVDs the video and audio quality are average, with slight graininess at times.  However, this can be forgiven because of the excellent quality of the film.  Those who have only seen Pan Scan versions on Cable and VHS will enjoy the widescreen presentation.  The extras include a Behind the Scenes Special, Trailer, Fan Club Information, Bios and Production Photos.  All are excellent and welcome additons.  Of note, I found the Behind the Scenes Special added to the film experience. You will learn interesting tidbits about the making of the movie, with comments by the director, Reeve, Seymour and other players.  It becomes readily apparent that the actors and crew loved making this film and hold it in a special place in their hearts.  To see Reeve, who suffered a horseback-riding accident that left him paralyzed years after making the film, lends to the heartbreaking experience of seeing the film again.  His comments about the final scenes of the film are very interesting and insightful to his own tragic life experience.  The production photos are excellent, especially the stills of Seymour with her incredibly beautiful face and long, flowing hair. It is easy to relate and believe that Reeve's character would fall so hopelessly in love with her picture alone.

I'm paraphrasing, but that's pretty much the gist of the the last line of the review.It would help if some movie critics could get their facts straight. There is a Somewhere in Time fan club called INSITE in which 50% of the members are men, which disproves Mr. Shannon's sexist notion that only women can like this movie-or any romantic film, for that matter.Sexist statements that are not based on facts are not only foolish, they are narrow-minded, piggish, and immature.  Alas, it is not the fault of the filmmakers that some critics have to stoop so low in a pathetic attempt at being humorous.  Somewhere in Time is a timeless classic that is, to this day, attracting new fans.  This can be proven by a music video of the film, which was created by a 16 year old MAN for YouTube, just a couple of years ago.The fact that Mr. Shannon didn't think much of the film is immaterial to me, because one can like or dislike a film as one sees fit.

60496,AC4OS65DJPQMN,0783228015,E.L. Cruz,"[2, 5]","This movie is about true love that transcends time. Richard Collier (Reeve) is a playwright from the late 1970s who is approached by a strange old woman. Lovingly and reverently, she places a gold pocketwatch into Richard's hand and utters four cryptic words: &quot;Come back to me,&quot; before she disappears into the shadows.Eight years after that strange meeting, Richard drives to a luxurious old hotel in the countryside. There, he sees a picture of the lovely young Elise McKenna (Seymour), a talented actress who reached her prime around 1910 and 1912. In a flash of recognition, Richard realizes that this is the same woman, now deceased, who gave him the gold watch eight years ago. Spurred by love and obsession, Richard struggles to conquer mind-induced time travel to reach Elise back in 1912, thereby recapturing the love that has eluded him, yet has been powerful enough to transcend decades.The plotline is definitely beautiful and mesmerizing to envision, yet the movie itself was surprisingly disappointing. However, there were some definite positive points of the film. The lush scenery of the New England coast and the beautiful Grand Hotel are great testaments to the cinematography of early 80s movies. Reeve's character, Richard, is handsome and likeable because of his awkward yet dashing personality. The chemistry between Richard and Elise is amazing. Each look they cast upon each other sets the sparks flying, and their love for one another is so powerful that it infused every moment of the movie.However, despite the beauty of the film, the plotline is severely lacking. The story has numerous holes in it that do not explain how the elderly Elise had the watch in the first place, or how Richard knew her in the past and then magically appeared in the 1970s with no recollection of her. Plus, the conclusion of the film is dismaying and heartbreaking. When I saw what happened to Richard, I felt like the whole ordeal he went through to reach Elise in the past was for nothing. It is difficult to watch a human being break down and waste away into nothing.I agree with other reviews that if you watch this movie with an open mind, oblivious to the constraints of epochs and rationality, but with the hope of romantic enlightenment in mind, then you would be enraptured by this movie. Unfortunately, I cannot stand a movie that does not have a solid conclusion, or at least a conclusion where you can figure out what happened and mentally tie up loose ends. The ending of this movie left me completely lost. And it is definitely debatable whether or not this movie had a happy ending.And another thing to keep in mind: Although I've never read it, this movie was based on a novel called BID TIME RETURN by Richard Matheson. Therefore, you can be almost certain that there is a crucial element in the book that the movie doesn't cover that would fill the holes in the plot. That is why I am being generous with 3 stars.

60497,AT2ONGBAQ8HFD,0783228015,Ema Nnep,"[5, 5]","This may qualify as one of the original 'chick flicks' but there is something wonderful about this movie.To break this down into big parts before putting them back together again, you have a handsome leading man, you have Jane Seymour who is, in my opinion, at the zenith of her beauty in this movie, you have a gorgeous old hotel from an era long since past and you have a lovestory that defies time.Now, to put the pieces back together again, you have our hero, Peter Collier/Chris Reeves, who is celebrating the opening night of his very first play with all his college friends and family around him, and gliding out of the shadows is a delicate, fragile old woman in a black Victorian gown with her platinum hair swept up into a period hairstyle and she goes to Peter and touches his shoulder.  He turns to her and is startled to see a woman who he not only doesn't know but also clearly doesn't belong in the group surrounding him.She gazes at him for a moment and everything goes silent as he stares at her, not sure what to do, then she says to him, 'Come back to me,' and places a gold pocket watch in his hand, curls his fingers around it and then glides back into the shadows, leaving everyone stunned.  When his friends ask Peter who she was he admits that he has no idea who she was and then looks at the pocket watch in amazement because he can tell it's an antique.We then see him in his apartment years later, reviews and accolades framed on the walls while he deals with a case of writer's block and decides he needs to get out of town to clear his head.  He hops in his little Triump Spitfire and tools off into the countryside away from the city and happens to drive past The Grand Hotel  which is actually a place you can visit and apparently people make 'pilgrimages' there because of this movie  then thinks better of it and goes zipping up to get himself a room.While he waits for a room to be readied, he wanders around taking in the beauty of the hotel and wanders into a room that is dedicated to the history of the hotel and as he walks in he catches a glimpse of this most gorgeous woman gazing at him as he walks through a shaft of sunlight coming through the window, momentarily blinding him until he walks through it and realizes that the woman he saw was actually a photo mounted on the far wall.  He goes to it, transfixed by the woman's beauty and the expression on her face and finds that the nameplate is missing from the photo.Completely intrigued, he asks the bellman about the photo and he learns that she was an actress, a very well known and acclaimed actress named Elise McKenna who had performed at the small theater along the lake of the hotel's grounds.What follows is a detective story of sorts, because as Peter learns more about Elise, he discovers that it was she who came to him that night at the theater when his first play was performed and gave him the watch, dying that very night after she left him with that one entreaty.He discovers more clues that lead him to believe that he was, in fact, with her when she was young and is determined to find out how it happened, determined to find a way to make it happen, and when he does, he finds that Elise's manager is none too pleased to see this young man coming into her life and ruining all the well laid plans that he had made for her.Despite the obstacles, they do manage to steal time to be together, get to know each other, fall in love with each other, and then Peter is thrown back to his own time.While I have never really been overly impressed with Christopher Reeves' acting, I have to say that in the scene when he comes back and scrambles to return, finally realizing he going to be unable to get back to her, when he begins to weep with the loss of the love of his life, there is no way you cannot feel that pain with him and it never ceases to make me cry every time I see it.The ending reminds me very much of the last scene of the original Wuthering Heights and The Ghost and Mrs. Muir, but this movie haunts you it's so good.  The music in this movie, especially the love theme, is exquisite and when it plays while the two are together, just looking at each other as they discover and learn about each other, it just makes your heart ache in the best, most bittersweet way.It might be a chick flick, but it truly is worth watching again and again.",5,There is just something about this movie...,1318118400,"10 9, 2011",2011,4366,"['may', 'qualify', 'one', 'original', 'flicks', 'something', 'wonderful', 'movie.To', 'break', 'down', 'big', 'parts', 'putting', 'back', 'together', 'again', 'have', 'handsome', 'leading', 'man', 'have', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'who', 'opinion', 'zenith', 'beauty', 'movie', 'have', 'gorgeous', 'old', 'hotel', 'era', 'long', 'past', 'have', 'lovestory', 'time.Now', 'put', 'pieces', 'back', 'together', 'again', 'have', 'hero', 'Peter', 'Collier/Chris', 'Reeves', 'who', 'celebrating', 'opening', 'night', 'very', 'first', 'play', 'college', 'friends', 'family', 'gliding', 'shadows', 'delicate', 'fragile', 'old', 'woman', 'black', 'Victorian', 'gown', 'platinum', 'hair', 'swept', 'up', 'period', 'hairstyle', 'Peter', 'shoulder', 'startled', 'see', 'woman', 'who', 'not', 'only', ""n't"", 'know', 'also', 'clearly', ""n't"", 'belong', 'group', 'surrounding', 'him.She', 'gazes', 'moment', 'everything', 'silent', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'do', 'then', 'back', 'gold', 'pocket', 'watch', 'hand', 'curls', 'fingers', 'then', 'glides', 'back', 'shadows', 'leaving', 'everyone', 'stunned', 'When', 'friends', 'ask', 'Peter', 'who', 'was', 'idea', 'who', 'was', 'then', 'pocket', 'watch', 'amazement', 'can', 'tell', 'antique.We', 'then', 'see', 'apartment', 'years', 'later', 'reviews', 'accolades', 'framed', 'walls', 'case', 'writer', 'block', 'get', 'town', 'clear', 'head', 'little', 'Triump', 'Spitfire', 'tools', 'off', 'countryside', 'away', 'city', 'drive', 'Grand', 'Hotel', 'actually', 'place', 'can', 'visit', 'apparently', 'people', 'make', ""'pilgrimages"", 'movie', 'then', 'better', 'zipping', 'up', 'get', 'room.While', 'room', 'be', 'readied', 'around', 'taking', 'beauty', 'hotel', 'wanders', 'room', 'dedicated', 'history', 'hotel', 'glimpse', 'most', 'gorgeous', 'woman', 'gazing', 'shaft', 'sunlight', 'coming', 'window', 'momentarily', 'blinding', 'woman', 'saw', 'was', 'actually', 'photo', 'mounted', 'far', 'wall', 'transfixed', 'woman', 'beauty', 'expression', 'face', 'nameplate', 'missing', 'photo.Completely', 'intrigued', 'bellman', 'photo', 'was', 'actress', 'very', 'well', 'known', 'acclaimed', 'actress', 'named', 'Elise', 'McKenna', 'who', 'had', 'performed', 'small', 'theater', 'lake', 'hotel', 'grounds.What', 'detective', 'story', 'sorts', 'Peter', 'more', 'Elise', 'was', 'who', 'came', 'night', 'theater', 'when', 'first', 'play', 'was', 'performed', 'gave', 'watch', 'dying', 'very', 'night', 'left', 'one', 'entreaty.He', 'more', 'clues', 'lead', 'believe', 'was', 'fact', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'determined', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'happened', 'determined', 'find', 'way', 'make', 'happen', 'when', 'Elise', 'manager', 'none', 'too', 'pleased', 'see', 'young', 'man', 'coming', 'life', 'ruining', 'well', 'laid', 'plans', 'had', 'made', 'obstacles', 'do', 'manage', 'steal', 'time', 'be', 'together', 'get', 'know', 'other', 'fall', 'love', 'other', 'then', 'Peter', 'thrown', 'back', 'own', 'time.While', 'have', 'never', 'really', 'been', 'overly', 'impressed', 'Christopher', 'Reeves', 'acting', 'have', 'say', 'scene', 'when', 'back', 'scrambles', 'return', 'finally', 'realizing', 'going', 'be', 'unable', 'get', 'back', 'when', 'weep', 'loss', 'love', 'life', 'way', 'can', 'not', 'feel', 'pain', 'never', 'make', 'cry', 'time', 'see', 'it.The', 'ending', 'reminds', 'very', 'much', 'last', 'scene', 'original', 'Wuthering', 'Heights', 'Ghost', 'Mrs.', 'Muir', 'movie', 'so', 'good', 'music', 'movie', 'especially', 'love', 'theme', 'exquisite', 'when', 'two', 'are', 'together', 'just', 'looking', 'other', 'discover', 'learn', 'other', 'just', 'heart', 'ache', 'best', 'most', 'bittersweet', 'way.It', 'might', 'be', 'chick', 'flick', 'truly', 'worth', 'watching', 'again', 'again']",N/A

I only knew of Christopher Reeve for Superman, and then as I got older, Deathtrap (movie and play), Fifth of July (play), Monsignor (movie), etc.  But the comments are right, this IS his best role.  He plays Richard Collier, a reasonablly successful playright in the 1970s.  One day in 1972 after a successful show, an old woman walks up to him, hands him a gold watch and says ""Come Back To Me"".  Soon after she returns home and dies.  8 years later, it's 1980 and he's still thinking about her trying to get inspiration for his next play.  After checking into the Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island in Michigan, he starts having feelings of Deja Vu (even the old groundskeeper, bell captain seems to recognize him).  While going through the halls of history and some news clippings, he discovers pictures of beautiful actress Elise Mckenna (played in a bravura perfomance by Jane Seymour) who visited the island with her theater troupe in 1912.  He does some research on her and after finding a newspaper clipping from 1972 around he learns that the old woman was her.  Desperate to find out more, he finds a book in her last home called ""Travels in Time"".  He seeks out the author, who was an old professor of his, and learns his old professor's theories on time travel.  After returning to the hotel, he finds other artifacts of 1912 in the attic including the hotel registration, and discovers he was at the hotel back then.  He returns to his room, self hypnotizes himself and finds himself in 1912.  He then goes out of his way to find Elise, and become her friend without hinting anything about his trip from 68 years in the future.  He does, at they hit it off well, much to the dismay of the playright/leader of her troupe played by Christopher Plummer.  In the end love conquers all (or so you think), and Elise stays with Richard after her troupe leaves the island with plans for the future.  Until, that is Richard pulls a 1979 vintage penny out of his pocket, which causes him to return to the present.  He tries to rehypnotize himself to return to 1912, but nothing seems to work.

It has a different way to those sappy romance stories and being different is always better. It seperates itself from other movies. The way the movie was so interesting and how things came about. Time really worked with the people who made it possible. And the acting. Oh my gosh, the acting is amazing!Richard Collier is a playright just barely entering the 1980's. He knows something is missing in his life but he just can't place his finger on it. Upon a spur of the moment vacation, he comes across the Grand Hotel which strikes him as inspiring, until it becomes even more with the history of 1912 it has behind it that in fact includes him, even though he is only 29 years old, and along this line, a woman is looking for him.Though something has occurred along this line in time, Richard knows he has someone waiting for him, and that is he wants to find the woman he's been looking for, he'll have to sacrifice everything he knows and understands completely in the present for him to find his real life in the past, where Elise Mckenna and Richard will find each other in time.Before Back To The Future even came out, the brilliant Somewhere In Time brought up the thought of time travel without a machine, but only using the power of the mind. It is in fact extremely believable the way it is explained, and how it is done, and that's not easy to do. There was no doubt in my mind throughout the whole thing that he had in fact done it, and the way the whole process was reversed was also incredibly believable.The acting is amazing by the two very young Christopher Reeve (before his fateful accident) and Jane Seymour. The chemistry between the two is amazing. It made you feel as if they were chosen so perfectly for the parts, they were just meant to play those roles alone. I've seen them in other films, but none nearly as rememberable as in Somewhere in Time. Other fantastic actors such as Bill Erwin, and Christopher Plummer make this an even better movie to think and create an illusion in your own mind that you aren't watching a movie, but a real life story. I'm sure many people can relate to what happens throughout the film.Even if you didn't like the film, one thing you cannot deny by the whole thing is the amazing music. The Rhapsodey by Rachmoninoff, which was composed by John Barry, created a whole essence to the movie and it's plot all by itself, and you couldn't help but notice it the whole time in the movie. I was really surprised that Rachmoninoff could do something so beautiful instead of always being heard with these loud thumps on the piano.I just wish more romance movies would tangle with my mind such as Somewhere in Time. I'm only 14 and usually I like more action or horror movies, but in this case, Somewhere In Time did me over so much, the romantic feel to the movie somehow brough the imagination back out in me. Plus, the DVD has a really cool making of documentary on the film, and tells you so much you never knew about the film. It went a long way and still got criticized by reviewers. But I'm glad the public liked it. Even if you don't want to see it, at least see it, and maybe you'll find the romantic feeling within yourself.

I am not a big fan of romances, but as a time travel film, ""Somewhere in Time"" interested me greatly. The script of this film is written by Richard Matheson, based on his novel ""Bid Time Return"" (Matheson also wrote ""I Am Legend"" and a number of episodes of ""The Twilight Zone"", among other science-fiction and horror works), and he seems to have put a lot of thought into the logistics of his story, right down to the necessity of Collier having old money for when he goes back in time. Matheson's approach to time travel in this film is different from that which has been used in other films and yet, somehow it seems so much more logical than someone building a time machine, like in H.G. Wells's novel.The only thing I didn't like about this film is the abruptness of the ending. According to the discussion boards on IMDb, a second version of this film exists, that is about an hour longer than this version, which doesn't surprise me.

It's kind-of a girlish thing that resembles biting your fingernails.  No other way to describe it - for girls or for Superman - except ""cute.""

In this case, comic relief=innocently charming instead of ""smooth"" like we usually see in more recent films.There's definitely some dumb stuff going on in this movie too.

My husband and I took a pilgrimage to Mackinac island in 1981 to see where it all was filmed.  There wasnt much on the island about the movie at that time. Only a couple photos on the wall in the Grand Hotel. But theroom that appeared as the  Hall of History in the move was the same with it's red wallpaper. (Now all changed.)Other things have changed too and the storekeepers have since realised what a travelogue this movie was for their quaint island and sell memorabilia.Of course the SIT fan weekends made a big difference in awareness of the movie's impact.I have had every version of this movie since it was released on video back in the 80s. My first version was laden with dropouts from the frequent viewings.The last dvd version was good but not perfect--Never have I see truer colors, more detail (and thats hard when you've seen a film as many times as Ive seen this.) than on this bluray release. I dont think it was this brilliantly colorful when I saw it at the movies back when it was released. Also Jane looked even more stunning in bluray if that is possible.It almost has a 3-D quality to it, the forefront images are so crystal clear.  I never noticed Chris' victorian shirt was a mint green, his striped suit a lightweight wool. Anyway, I waited for this film on bluray for quite some time and it did not disappoint.Only 2 scenes were a little grainy--One when Susan French comes back from the stage play clutching Collier's programand the second when Jane Seymour is in her dressing room before the play.Other than those the bluray edition is 100% improvement over all those that came before. If you love the film before, you'll enjoy it even more on bluray.The specials are the same as on the Special edition 20th anniversary DVD release.",5,The Ultimate version of the film,1393977600,"03 5, 2014",2014,1886,"['Not', 'alot', 'say', 'wonderful', 'story', 'been', 'described', 'many', 'Other', 'favorite', 'movie', 'time', 'husband', 'took', 'pilgrimage', 'Mackinac', 'island', '1981', 'see', 'where', 'was', 'filmed', 'wasnt', 'much', 'island', 'movie', 'time', 'Only', 'couple', 'photos', 'wall', 'Grand', 'Hotel', 'theroom', 'appeared', 'Hall', 'History', 'move', 'was', 'same', 'red', 'wallpaper', 'Now', 'changed', 'Other', 'things', 'have', 'changed', 'too', 'storekeepers', 'have', 'realised', 'what', 'travelogue', 'movie', 'was', 'quaint', 'island', 'sell', 'memorabilia.Of', 'course', 'SIT', 'fan', 'weekends', 'made', 'big', 'difference', 'awareness', 'movie', 'impact.I', 'have', 'had', 'version', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'video', 'back', '80s', 'first', 'version', 'was', 'laden', 'dropouts', 'frequent', 'viewings.The', 'last', 'dvd', 'version', 'was', 'good', 'not', 'perfect', 'Never', 'have', 'see', 'truer', 'colors', 'more', 'detail', 'thats', 'hard', 'when', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'many', 'times', 'Ive', 'seen', 'bluray', 'release', 'dont', 'think', 'was', 'brilliantly', 'colorful', 'when', 'saw', 'movies', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'Also', 'Jane', 'looked', 'even', 'more', 'stunning', 'bluray', 'possible.It', 'almost', '3-D', 'quality', 'forefront', 'images', 'are', 'so', 'crystal', 'clear', 'never', 'noticed', 'Chris', 'victorian', 'shirt', 'was', 'mint', 'green', 'striped', 'suit', 'lightweight', 'wool', 'Anyway', 'waited', 'film', 'bluray', 'quite', 'time', 'did', 'not', 'disappoint.Only', '2', 'scenes', 'were', 'little', 'grainy', 'One', 'when', 'Susan', 'French', 'back', 'stage', 'play', 'clutching', 'Collier', 'programand', 'second', 'when', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'dressing', 'room', 'play.Other', 'bluray', 'edition', '100', '%', 'improvement', 'came', 'before', 'love', 'film', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'even', 'more', 'bluray.The', 'specials', 'are', 'same', 'Special', 'edition', '20th', 'anniversary', 'DVD', 'release']",N/A

60515,A5WMBIOGE8Q6N,0783228015,"Golden Lion ""Reader""","[4, 4]","Time travel is all in ones mind.  The paradox is that Richard could return back in time, find his love, gain happiness, and inevitably return back too 1979, and die of a broken heart.The Book, ""Travels through Time"" was a key.  9 years previously Richard was a student of the professor.While at college Richard studied with a physics professor, who wrote a book, ""Journey in Time"", on time travel.  Richard asked the professor, ""Is time travel possible""?  The professor believed he had accomplished time travel, only a few seconds because of objects from the present brought him back to the present.  The professor instructed Richard; too remove all the objects associated with the present.  Richard decides to buy a suite probably 15 years older than the target year 1912 and attempts to move his mind back in time.  In one of the last scenes, Elise jests about how Richard's suit is 15 years out of style and Elise wants to buy Richard a new suit.  It is during this scene that Richard discovers the 1979 penny disrupting the channel back in time and returns back to the present.The professor told Richard, he believed time travel was possible and by emerging ones mind totally on the past and remove all reminders of the current, time travel to the past could occur.  Richard removes pictures, coins, and puts the recorder under his bed.  Richard discovers a registry for room 416 with his signature on it in 1912 that gives Richard confidence, he did return too the past.  Richard finally is completely emerged in the past and allowed to move back through the time/space absolute into the past.Elise read ""Travels through Time"" over and over.  Elise in 1979, contacted Richard and placed a watch in his hand and said ""come back to me"".Richard wakes up June 27, 1912 on a bed (416), at the Grand Hotel.  Richard seems determined not to change the events leading to the future.  It seems impossible for events too be changed in any disruptive manner.  Richard knowing the future would make sure events such as his signature at the grand hotel occurred for the correct room and time.  Richard's cohesion in preserving time event as understood in 1979 remained a necessity as he move through time/space into the future as it would happen in 1979.  Just as Richard must accept the facts that he will go back in time, so must he accept the time events that form the future.If any evidence surfaced that pointed to the current, such as, a 1979 penny the time/space absolute time travel connection would be destroyed.  The watch would disappear, the night Richard returned too the future, and the night Elise died.  Did Richard fantasized his trip in time and so intensely emerge himself into the past that his realty became the past like a deep dream.  The mind's attempt to maintain symmetry would return him to the present and leave him devoid of his love.In 1910, Arthur was five and came with his father, who worked in the Grand Hotel.  Arther would ask Richard in 1979, ""Have we met before"".  Richard in the past was kind to Arther.In 1912, Elise had a photograph while smiling at Richard that hung on the wall of the Hotel archive room.  The photograph became a portal between the current and the past.  Richard fell in love with the photograph; the photograph seemed too span generations of time, a sink a love deep inside his heart with a message ""I want to be everything for you.  I want to make you happy"".  Richard was tormented by his infatuation and intrigue with the actress, ""One of the most revered actress on the stage"", ""creator of mystique on the stage"", and ""pinnacle of seclusion and privacy"".  Elise was ""bright"",""cheerful"", and after 1912 became quite.  Richard studied public library documentation on the Actress Elise McKeena.Every woman dreams that a prince will walk into her life.  A companion she can express  her deep emotional expressions of affection, passion, and longing; a companion who will make her happy and she him.  ""Is it you"" touches the essence of her realm and decisions and his reply of ""yes"" is the appropriately direct and assertive.  Did two people travel back in time: Both Richard and Robinson? Robinson, told Elise she would met a man, who someday that would change her life.  Robinson used the illusion too keep Elise his captive bird and it is probably just a coincidence that Richard did travel back to met the perfect woman and free her.Richard single mindedness hope to establish relationship is rudely intercepted by Robinson. Robinson tells Richard, ""leave Ms. Mckeena alone or I will see that your put out.""  What does ""Is it you mean""?  Richard is a complete stranger, a play writer from Chicago, and a man Elise has never before seen.  Richard is the symbol of the perfect man for Elise.  Does Elise have time for love?  Can Elise maintain control of her career and love Richard?There was something strange about William Robinson (Plumber is brilliant - Shogan Jesuit priest adversary against Blackthorne) relationship with Elise.  Some of the music was reused in ""Dances with Wolves"".  Robinson is the ""Phantom of the Menace"" and claims too be the Actress ""Guardian"" responsible for turning Elise into a star.  Robinson worships Elise, finding her young, and culturing her into a star.  Robinson secretly loves Elise but can not declare his love for her.  The best Robinson can do is declares his possession of her.  When Richard asks Robinson, if he wants Elise for a wife, Robinson is insatiable about his appraise of Elise. Elise loves Richard and defends her love for Richard. Elise is cruel to Robinson telling him, ""I love Richard"" and rebukes sharply telling him not to interfere with their love.  Robinson rejection forces him, too bind in cord, Richard and leave him gagged in a horse stable.Many of Reeves idoms seem quirky and boyishly ackward in comparison to British sophistry. ""If you do not walk with me, I shall go insane, simply mad."" ""Surely, I would walk with you and resolve all about me"", ""just say yes"", and ""she's crazy about me"".  The scenry and music are classics.  The movie only intrigues more and more people to watch over time.",5,Time travel is all in ones mind.,1151280000,"06 26, 2006",2006,6115,"['Time', 'travel', 'ones', 'mind', 'paradox', 'Richard',

The scene that really got me was when Elise was making her speech about love in the play. Great movie. Sadly, Christopher Reeve had a horrible accidnt in the mid-90's, which meant he would never walk again. I'd have loved to see him and Jane Seymour do another film together. Jane Seymour was radiant as always and excellent as Elise (my favourite character from this movie). Christopher Reeve was terrific, just off his star-making turn in ""Superman: The Movie."" Christopher Plummer was as authoritarian as he was in ""The Sound Of Music"" with a touch of menace added. I fail to see why this romantic movie that had very little objectionable material (one ""S"" word) didn't do well when released in 1980.

Finney's book details how its hero transitions from the present to the past as a scientific project, relying more on historical inter weavings than plot.  &#34;Somewhere in Time&#34;, using Finney's devices unembarassedly, is a simple love story, and ultimately much less effective.Reeve falls in love with a photograph of a beautiful performer (Seymour), hanging on the wall of a 19th century hotel he accidentally visits.  Determined to find the object of his love in the flesh, he sequesters himself in a room in the hotel, recreating the circumstances and environment of the 1890's.  Just as it does in the novel it stole from, this ploy works, and the hero finds himself in the presence of the woman he loves.So far so good.  Then the bottom drops out.  In brief, there's really no story here; mutual love is immediate, threatened only by a sinister manager who is determined to destroy the relationship between the actress and the hero.  This all goes absolutely nowhere, and despite the sincere efforts of the cast, it's fluffy and insignificant in the worst sense of the world.This is a deliberate tear-jerker, not only because these lovers are torn apart by a simple oversight on the part of the hero, but because, for no particular reason unable to to travel back in time and find his lover again,  he just gives up.

However, I'd like to take a moment to compare this wonderful film to two other ""failures"" you may be familiar with...In 1939, when the ""Wizard of Oz"" was initially released, it was considered a failure by MGM. It wasn't until 10 years later, when it was re-released in 1949, that MGM was pleased with the box-office profits. In later years, as movie fans all over the world discovered it on television, it went on to become one of the ""most watched films in history"" (according to the Library of Congress). Also, it's commonly listed as one of the top 10 best movies ever made.also...When ""Its a wonderful life"" was released in 1946/47 it was considered a major dissapointment and a box-office flop. Thanks to television, and video rentals, it's now recognized by the American Film Institute as one of the 100 greatest films ever made, and is listed at number ONE on their list of the most inspirational films of all time.Not bad for two ""failures""....huh?Now, please understand that I'm not trying to elevate Somewhere in Time to the same ""legendary"" status as the aforementioned films, but it's not THAT different of a success story. And for that matter, from the perspective of storytelling, not that different as far as content as well.Just like the Wizard of Oz, or It's a wonderful Life, Somewhere in Time mixes fantasy elements into a very simple plot structure. The result; a film that initially caused most viewers and critics to cry ""corny"" and ""cheese"". However, in later years, thanks to cable TV, VHS rentals, and now DVD, a HUGE fan base has appeared. It seems that all the jaded critics in the world couldn't destroy the simple magic found within this film!We really do need a BLU-RAY release!If you like this film, you might also enjoy another 80's classic ""The Boy Who Could Fly"".

Dentro del 'amante pian&iacute;simo"" argumento, el amor despliega, sobres de pasi&oacute;n, y fines de intimidad sobre nosotros con fuerza y fuego de dentro. Observamos a Minero de Richard (jug&oacute; con matiz por Christopher Reeve) volviendo en el tiempo de seguir a una mujer de otra era (Elise McKenna, jugado con la belleza y la gracia por Jane Seymour y en a&ntilde;os m&aacute;s anticipados jugados por la actriz estimada Teresa Correcto). Nosotros no sabemos exactamente c&oacute;mo es posible (viaje de tiempo) pero aceptamos la premisa como affectionados de este g&eacute;nero. Si Richard tiene alas en la eternidad tan hacen nosotros. Si puede transportarse atr&aacute;s en tiempo, as&iacute; que puede nosotros. Afterall que nos invertimos en un romance alto. Es pleamar o nada: una vez nosotros somos consumidos con los temas ricos jam&aacute;s presenta en este drama de categor&iacute;a.Todo llega a ser secundario: miramos s&oacute;lo al momento los ojos encuentran suyo; cuando ella - el suave - reconoce su gentileza en su beneficio, y lo invita a continuar en sus gestos, que afecta su susceptibilidad (m&aacute;s que &eacute;l quiz&aacute;s sepa); ordena la etapa (literalmente y en sentido figurado) cuando viene a intervalos rom&aacute;nticos. Es ella que sabe los matices y calidades sombr&iacute;as de un intervalo fuerte o d&eacute;bil, comenzando del tiempo que avanza su masculinidad sobre su femininity al tiempo que retira aspectos de su persona, para permitirla presentar aspectos de su persona. Sus emociones nos persuaden a quedarnos por su lado, no importa lo que la separemos de su amante escogido. Su profundidad eleva nuestra empat&iacute;a.Por supuesto, sabemos la fuerza de mentiras de Richard en su alcance de esas sutilezas. La verdad de la historia: La pasi&oacute;n de Elise no bajar&aacute;. Es un resultado inevitable. Asentimos a su amor intenso para Richard de 'en alg&uacute;n lugar En Tiempo' de otra manera que su propio. Le regresar&aacute; o ir&aacute; a &eacute;l. Vinculamos con ella f&aacute;cilmente una vez ella indica su deseo en el escenario delante de una audiencia empacada, en el soliloquio ahora famoso por Jane Seymour. Quiz&aacute;s esto es el &eacute;xtasis ocultado dentro del argumento. Nuestra hero&iacute;na no permitir&aacute; el ""amor inacabado"" quedarse constante en su vida; llegar&aacute; sin ayuda para reunirse con su amante partido. Recomiende sumamente este romance hist&oacute;rico.

60563,ARNWCLQZFQECA,0783228015,John Paquette,"[5, 5]","This is a time-travel fantasy on a par with &quot;Back To The Future,&quot; but far more romantic, and using, arguably, a more interesting device for time travel: self-hypnosis.  The fantastic premise is simple: what if convincing yourself you were in the past actually took you there somehow?First, the basics. The script is great. The plotting is airtight. The cinematography is perfect. The acting is very good. The direction, and the timing of action, is stellar.  It has what I'd call the best on-screen kiss.  And the crowning feature of the film is something I don't dare mention.What makes the film work, though, is that it doesn't spell it all out for you.  At its end you'll be thinking lots of &quot;hows&quot; and &quot;whys&quot;, and wanting to see it again to figure things out better.Jane Seymour (as actress Elise McKenna) is luminous here. Christopher Reeve is winningly gawky and hunky at the same time.  Their romantic tension is palpable, and it makes their high-speed love affair very convincing.  Christopher Plummer has great substance as Elise McKenna's protective manager.This film at once takes romance seriously, and uses time travel to create a mind-bending plot that will haunt you afterward.The only weakness of this film is that it is a bit light on the characterization.  We see that Richard (Reeve) and Elise (Seymour) love each other, and we must guess that it is ultimately because of their love for the theatre, but this is never made fully explicit.  Still, this &quot;weakness&quot; is in the nature of this very plot-driven film.  It's mainly a series of events that all fit together like a puzzle, rather than a study of human nature.  That the romance is so believable is a tribute to the acting and the direction, rather than the script.",4,Superb time travel fable,1071705600,"12 18, 2003",2003,1780,"['time-travel', 'fantasy', 'par', 'quot', 'Back', 'Future', 'quot', 'far', 'more', 'romantic', 'using', 'arguably', 'more', 'interesting', 'device', 'time', 'travel', 'self-hypnosis', 'fantastic', 'premise', 'simple', 'what', 'convincing', 'were', 'past', 'actually', 'took', 'somehow', 'First', 'basics', 'script', 'great', 'plotting', 'airtight', 'cinematography', 'perfect', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'direction', 'timing', 'action', 'stellar', 'what', ""'d"", 'call', 'best', 'on-screen', 'kiss', 'crowning', 'feature', 'film', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'dare', 'mention.What', 'film', 'work', ""n't"", 'spell', 'out', 'end', ""'ll"", 'be', 'thinking', 'lots', 'quot', 'quot', 'quot', 'quot', 'wanting', 'see', 'again', 'figure', 'things', 'out', 'better.Jane', 'Seymour', 'actress', 'Elise', 'McKenna', 'luminous', 'here', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'winningly', 'gawky', 'hunky', 'same', 'time', 'romantic', 'tension', 'palpable', 'high-speed', 'love', 'affair', 'very', 'convincing', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'great', 'substance', 'Elise', 'McKenna', 'protective', 'manager.This', 'film', 'once', 'romance', 'seriously', 'time', 'travel', 'create', 'mind-bending', 'plot', 'will', 'haunt', 'afterward.The', 'only', 'weakness', 'film', 'bit', 'light', 'characterization', 'see', 'Richard', 'Reeve', 'Elise', 'Seymour', 'love', 'other', 'must', 'guess', 'ultimately', 'love', 'theatre', 'never', 'made', 'fully', 'explicit', 'Still', 'quot', 'weakness', 'quot', 'nature', 'very', 'plot-driven', 'film', 'mainly', 'series', 'events', 'fit', 'together', 'puzzle', 'rather', 'study', 'human', 'nature', 'romance', 'so', 'believable', 'tribute', 'acting', 'direction', 'rather', 'script']",N/A
60564,A22BPC7LRSGSYQ,0783228015,Joker,"[3, 4]","So much has already been written about the plot, etc. by other reviewers that I just want to give a few thoughts on this movie...Somebody I know ranks this as his third favorite movie of all time, so I was curious to see it.  I had never seen it until several months ago.  This movie was released in 1980 and basically was a box office bomb.  I guess it got buried by The Blues Brothers, which was released the same week.  This movie has gained in stature in the decades since its release.  It now has a cult following.  Basically it's a sappy love story with some supernatural elements and/or science fiction thrown in the mix (example -- traveling through time).  The movie is very slow moving, soft, tender, and sappy, but it did hold my attention somewhat.  This movie stars Christopher Reeve, Jane Seymour, and Teresa Wright.  Reeve acts very much like he does when he played Clark Kent/Superman in the Superman movies.  I don't know if was intentional or not, but it's Reeve as most people know him.  Jane Seymour looks good and her acting is good.  The musical score by John Barry (King Kong 1976) is a big plus and it's quite good.  The screenplay was written by Richard Matheson (The Legend Of Hell House) and it was well done.When it comes to movies that fall into the love story category, I like to draw the line somewhere.  I like such ""love story"" or ""romance"" movies as Vertigo (1958), Notorious (1946), Rebecca (1940), Humoresque (1946), Rear Window (1954), Marnie (1964), Titanic (1997), etc. (I can give many other examples), BUT these movies have additional aspects about them that make them more watchable and appealing to me.  For example, Vertigo is quite a dark, haunting, and suspenseful romance story.  Notorious is dark, suspenseful, and the love story doesn't make up the entire plot, in other words, it's a subplot.  Rebecca is very gothic in feel and has the evil Mrs. Danvers.  Humoresque has a romance that is rocky from the start and never fully develops.  Rear Window is another movie that has a romance mixed in with a dark and suspenseful story.  Marnie has a plot that's centered around a woman with psychological problems, while her boss TRIES to romance her.  Titanic has a love story mixed in with the sinking of the ship, a sad and tragic event.  I guess I like seeing romance movies when the romance is mixed in with a dark and suspenseful plot.  I like dark and suspenseful movies and horror movies.  Just my taste, I guess.  Somewhere In Time, on the other hand, is pretty much just a straight romance movie.  It's a little too sappy, soft, and tender for me.Overall, an OK movie if you like your romance movies very soft, tender, played straight, and with little ""oomph"".  If you're like me, you prefer that your romance movies have more ""oomph"", darkness, and suspense.UPDATE - I re-watched this movie in December 2012 and couldn't believe I originally gave it 3 3/4 stars, rounded up to 4.

I do not see how people got loop holes in this.  I have seen this movie about, (and I am not kidding with this) 200-300 times.  There is not a single loop hole in this.  The movie shows the boundaries of love.  It shows that if u love and believe enough neither Time nor Death will hold it back. If your want to completely understand this movie, and I say this to EVERY person I tell 2 watch this movie, watch it AT least twice.  You will not understand it unless u see it at least twice.  if u watch it only once u will not get it.  The more u see it the more u will get it.  This movie is PERFECTION from the soundtrack to the costumes.  I almost spent a night in the hotel on Mackenac Island in Elise's room.  Until I found out it was over $700 per night.  I mean who is going 2 spend that $$$?  The movie is a guy that is down and going 2 escape.  It opens up at the opening of an aspiring playwrite in college. The opening night was a success.  An elderly woman comes up 2 him out of nowhere and puts something in his hand and says: ""Come Back To Me"".  And leaves.  Everyone asks who she was and he said he had no idea.  He looks in his hand and it is a pocket watch.  Several years later he is an accomplished Playwrite but is in a slump.  He decides to go on a pseudo vacation.  He ends up at this hotel on a whim.  He finds a picture.  The picture has his attention.  He is obsessed with it.  The picture draws him in.  He asks who it was by a guy that worked there for about 60 years.  Arthur says  ""Elise McKenna that picture was taken in... 1912"".  Richard decides since he is so drawn to 2 the beauty in the picture he needs 2 find out more.  He goes 2 the local library.  He researches Elise Mckenna.  He finds out she was an actress.  One of the most accomplished actresses in the very early 1900's.  Volumes and volumes.  And he comes across the last picture that was taken of her... it was the woman that gave him the pocket watch a few years ago.  I am not going 2 tell u the end it is up 4 u 2 watch.

But this film was different...Somewhere in Time is about a playright who, on the opening night of his first play sees a woman brush by him saying ""come back to me"", as she gives him an antique-looking watch.  Of course he becomes intrigued by this, and upon researching just who this woman is, finds out that she was a stage actress - many, many years before.He then travels to a beautiful resort where this woman used to perform, and sees her picture hanging there.  Upon seeing it, he becomes obsessed with ""finding"" her.  He is left with the problem, though, of how to find her when she's been dead for quite some time!With the hopes of reuniting with what appears to be a long lost love, he utilizes a method of self-hypnosis to traverse time.

60578,AEIPZ7QBQ9OIL,0783228015,Keaton Fan,"[1, 1]","I first saw this movie on TV years ago; they were advertising it, and since I'd never seen or even heard of it before, and I was intrigued by the premise, I decided to give it a go. I missed part of the film when a friend called, but I was hooked on it after we hung up.It's not a perfect film. There are plot holes, yes. But Reeve and Seymour are so good, and so believable, that they draw you in. I read that Reeve took some criticism after the film was released by being TOO sensitive in his portrayal of Richard Collier! Well, that was 1980 for you, folks.The DVD has a problem, or maybe it's just my copy, where at times in the film, the image suddenly becomes rather jerky. Fortunately, this doesn't last.I enjoyed watching the interviews, hard though it was to see the once-vibrant Christopher Reeve in a wheelchair, having to talk around the operation of his respirator. It was hard, too, to see him in the film, walking and running with ease.There's just something about this film that takes hold of you. As I mentioned before, Reeve and Seymour give perfect performances.

Unlike LOTR tho, this show is only about just two ""time-crossed"" lovers -- meeting and re-meeting versus all odds. Rather than being IN a great grand glorious world like LOTR, the lead couple CREATE their own richly deeply private world. This brings to life the literal [oldest] meaning of world -- from wer-ald [human-being life-time]. Also, the scenery and settings are just spot-on for the several areas and eras. Much of this movie was filmed on an island where motor-vehicles move about only by special permission. The lead couple, as actors, really got into their roles -- so are utterly believable.

The acting by Christopher Reeve, Jane Seymour, and Christopher Plummer (as the interfering manager W.F. Robinson) is superb. The musical score by composer John Barry is wonderful and also includes Rachmaninoff's Rhapsody. It has often been the musical choice of figure skaters for their skating programs and is actually where I first heard the music.Richard Collier (Reeve) is a playwright who lives in Chicago in 1980. One day, out of the blue, he receives the gift of a watch from an elderly woman who says, ""Come back to me"". He becomes haunted by this experience and becomes attracted to a picture in the hotel of a famous actress, Elise McKenna (Seymour). Through research he realizes that she is the same woman who gave him the watch and also that she died on the same day. He then begins his struggle, through hypnosis, to make it back to 1912 to renew his acquaintance with Elise.The movie is slow paced, but has some very touching moments. I love the scene of their first meeting when Elise says, ""Is it you?"" It contains a minimal amount of swearing (religious in nature)and also the ending love scene, although tastefully done, may cause it to be inappropriate for children under 12. I personally prefer the Hallmark movie, The Love Letter, which has a similar theme but is more appropriate for all ages.It is not surprising that this movie has become a cult classic, with fans meeting every October at the Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island, Michigan, where the story takes place and was filmed. It was also filmed in Chicago.The special edition also includes an interesting featurette from 2000 about the making of the film and interviews with the actors. Christopher Reeve shares an experience from his own life that is very similar to what happens to his character in the film.

Maybe this is  really a Harlequin made into a movie, but, at age 18, with movie tastes at  that time in the &quot;Animal House/Blazing Saddles&quot; vein, I was so  taken with this movie that I bought tickets to see the second showing that  night.  Jane Seymour is perfect as the exemplar of Late Victorian beauty  and grace. Her presence on the screen is positively mesmerizing, and makes  her efforts in other works seem rather anticlimax.  Christopher Plummer is  also superb as her semi-visionary mentor.  Christopher Reeve also does a  fine job.  The plot: In 1972, an aged, retired actress from another era,  Elise McKenna, goes to see a play at Medfield College, staged by a  student-playwright.  She, with grave dignity mingled with passion, silently  makes her way through the throng of well-wishers to press a gold watch into  his hands, with the barely audible worde, &quot;Come back to me.&quot;  Just as quickly, she is gone.  Eight years later, Richard is sucessful, but  spiritually empty.  By chance, he decides to stop at the Grand Hotel.  Lighting upon a dusty history room, he sees The Picture - an exquisite  beauty who inflames his imagination.

In the deft hands of screenwriter Richard Matheson, the answers to those questions take us on a fantastic journey into the past.Yes, it's a sappy story.

Its intense romanticism prompts us to break the rules in judging what makes a good movie, much as Christopher Reeve's love for Jane Seymour allows him break the rules of time.  And, the movie is even more poignant today, since it's about going back into the past, and it reminds us of the past physical vibrance of Christopher Reeve, not as Superman, but as the healthy young man he was.In many ways, this is Reeve's movie.  He almost ruins it with his occasional lapses into Clark-Kentish oafishness, but he also injects into the film its dreamy sweetness, with his hungering eyes and his boyish awe of Miss Seymour.  Speaking of her, I think she is one of the most beautiful and competent screen actresses in films and I have no idea why she never really became a huge movie star.Christopher Plummer adds the right notes of meanness, thinly-veiled jealousy, lurking menace, and his own inner hurt as the blunt end of a love triangle.  He also embodies reality, reminding us, by his dissapproving presence, of the vulnerability of the fragile love affair between Reeves and Seymour.The special segment on the making of the film (in the collector's edition DVD) is a good one.  It convincingly shows that the director, crew, and cast loved making this film and had high hopes for it.  It also provides some interesting insights into how the novel was adapted for the screen and the choices, sometimes painful, that had to be made in the process.  It's gratifying that this segment, which is low-key and refreshingly sincere, features the three principal stars of the film, the director, the composer, the author, and other players and crew members.  Only the composer, John Barry, seems a bit taken with himself.Somewhere In Time was nominated for the American Film Institute's list of the 100 most romantic movies of all time, but it didn't make it.

A great photography can make one falling in love with the person in the past. This movie is made to be the classic of its time, when 80s the romance story seldom hit the line, it was a stand out of its kind.

Right after his first major success with the first Superman movie, he wanted to do something else that would show he was a legitimate actor and not an action star.  This movie did not make a huge splash in the box office, but thanks to it's repeats on cable in the 80s when cable first came out, it gained a cult status that would not be equalled among most romantic movies.  There is just enough mystery and fantasy elements to make us all cry buckets of tears, even the most hardened souls who have lost all hope at finding love and romance in the world.Christopher Reeve plays Richard, a playwrite who is one day approached by an older woman with a strange message.  She hands him a pocket watch and says ""Come back to me"", then walks away.  A few years later, Richard does some investigating and finds out that the strange woman who did that passed away that very night she handed him the pocket watch.  What is this all about?  After some more research, he decides to travel back in time (no really) to find this mysterious woman who performed at a hotel in which he was doing to have his play premiere.  A little ridiculous?  Yes it is.  But then he sees the woman walking by the lake that he saw in the photograph, a beautiful Jane Seymour, Elise, in that delightful flapper outfit and looking just perfect.  They fall in love because they were meant to be in love even though they were born in different times.Ridiculous?  Yes it is.  But then again, it's about love.  How many of us have done something crazy for love?  If you haven't, then you are missing out.  Even those of us who have been burned (as we all have in some way), know that we must take a chance in life because there are no absolutes.  And when we see that photograph or find that person from the past, we look at them and say ""that was the one who got away"".  And if you don't take a risk, you will not learn.

Picture quality is at times disappointing, and the audio never was very well mixed to begin with, but there has always been something beautiful about this film's imperfections. The score by John Barry is of course exceptional and incredibly moving, and the performances are top-notch all round, as I'm sure most of you reading this will already know.Particularly interesting on the 20th anniversary DVD is the documentary 'Back to Somewhere in Time'.

I watched it with my gf and she, a person that adores classical movies and watches them a lot unlike me, actually stopped watching it before I did and went to do something else. Her complaint was that it was too boring.However, my complaint is that there are major gaps in this movie and the ending was in no manner satisfying. It leaves you with a very big empty hole in your stomach and makes you wonder ""okay what the heck just happened?"".The gap I'm mainly talking about is the time space in which the movie should have used to give the characters moments that help justify the kind of love they have grown to have with each other. It's like the guy comes into her life, goes out to walk with her....and boom, she's madly in love with him and so is he with her. They don't even show the steps in their relationship, the steps needed to form that kind of bond (they do but barely). You would expect to see them go out and have a good time and go through more relationship related issues before the end.It's like the main part or body of the movie is cut out. The movie is good in one sense but horrific in another. The ending was pathetic and very unsatisfying in every sense. If you think about it, why would she do that to him? She basically destroyed his real life by coming back for him in the beginning part of the movie. True love isn't suppose to do that? What's the point? He was living a great life before he realized about her existence. She would at least have somehow dropped him some clue that would have changed their potential fate.This movie is crap.....love it in many ways, but hate everything else.

60643,AOFW3CKGCVWV7,0783228015,Nice Old Guy,"[1, 1]","I despair to think that the vast cult of admirers of Somewhere in Time is dwindling because the last generation of romantics have now passed 50 and are on their way to extinction. If trends in movies and TV shows are an accurate gauge of attitudes toward love, recent generations find immediate sex sensible but the waiting game of romance idiotic.  As a high school teacher and university instructor since two years after the release of Somewhere in Time, I have watched young people become less and less susceptible to the romantic sentiment on which films like this depend, not to mention the hundreds of other romantic classics from earlier decades, like The Apartment or Now, Voyager, which I mention specifically because they are gloriously romantic without the exchange of a single kiss at their crowning moments.  Even on broadcast TV, with whole families watching, many shows combine the first kiss, ravenous and visceral, with the rapid shedding of clothes.  Although Somewhere in Time contains a quasi-nude scene, and although I am a man who enjoys ""manly"" entertainments which most Somewhere in Time fans would not like at all, I am not ashamed to say that this movie is and has always been for me a kind of religious experience. (My sister, also a devotee, is one of the thousands who made the pilgrimage to the Grand Hotel.)  But it is pointless, for example, to ask a 25-year old incapable of feeling sentiment what he thinks of the score of Somewhere in Time, Barry and Rachmaninoff in excelsis, or whether he would sit in a hotel room, alone, trying to recapture a lost moment in time until he needs a paramedic.

As any fan of Sci-Fi knows, time travel is a very risky venture at best. Such events as meeting yourself, accidently causing the death of a relative, and altering the time-stream (as depicted in the original STAR TREK episode &quot;City on the Edge of Forever&quot;) are just a few of the many pitfalls encountered. The sequence of time is also a major consideration. To quote perhaps the most famous time traveler of all (Dr. Who, of course!), &quot;Have I been here before... or am I yet to come?&quot;. In this movie, none of this really applies. For in &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot;, time travel... in the &quot;classic&quot; sense... is not the main event. This is NOT sci-fi, but a LOVE story that TRANSENDS time! Yes,there is one time &quot;loop&quot; here... starting when the &quot;old&quot; Elise gives Richard the watch. But the sequence of events should be taken just as presented in the movie, from both characters points of view. This is why Richard has no prior recollection of past events, even though the &quot;old&quot; Elise knows all. Only several years later, at the Grand Hotel, does he start to sence an affinity to the portrait of the &quot;young&quot; Elise, which causes him to realize that the old woman with the watch and the young woman in the portrait are one and the same. Thus begins his &quot;quest&quot; of love. In the final scene, he does what &quot;Sam&quot; does in the movie &quot;Ghost&quot;... reuniting with loved ones that have preceded him to &quot;the other side&quot;. It's as simple as that, and this is a great way to prevent repeating (that dreaded time-loop thingy)any events of the past. So don't try to over-think this flick... snuggle up with that &quot;special someone&quot;, keep plenty of tissues on hand... and enjoy one of the GREAT movies of out times!",4,Don't trip over the small stuff...,998956800,"08 28, 2001",2001,1998,"['reading', 'several', 'reviews', 'quot', 'Somewhere', 'Time', 'quot', 'one', 'issue', 'out', 'causing', 'confussion', 'amoung', 'viewers', 'matter', 'concerning', 'quot', 'time', 'travel', 'quot', 'fan', 'Sci-Fi', 'knows', 'time', 'travel', 'very', 'risky', 'venture', 'best', 'Such', 'events', 'meeting', 'accidently', 'causing', 'death', 'relative', 'altering', 'time-stream', 'depicted', 'original', 'STAR', 'TREK', 'episode', 'quot', 'City', 'Edge', 'Forever', 'quot', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'many', 'pitfalls', 'encountered', 'sequence', 'time', 'also', 'major', 'consideration', 'quote', 'perhaps', 'most', 'famous', 'time', 'traveler', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'course', 'quot', 'Have', 'been', 'here', 'before', 'am', 'yet', 'come', 'quot', 'movie', 'none', 'really', 'quot', 'Somewhere', 'Time', 'quot', 'time', 'travel', 'quot', 'classic', 'quot', 'sense', 'not', 'main', 'event', 'NOT', 'sci-fi', 'LOVE', 'story', 'TRANSENDS', 'time', 'Yes', 'one', 'time', 'quot', 'quot', 'here', 'starting', 'when', 'quot', 'old', 'quot', 'Elise', 'Richard', 'watch', 'sequence', 'events', 'should', 'be', 'taken', 'just', 'as', 'presented', 'movie', 'characters', 'points', 'view', 'why', 'Richard', 'prior', 'recollection', 'past', 'events', 'even', 'quot', 'old', 'quot', 'Elise', 'Only', 'several', 'years', 'later', 'Grand', 'Hotel', 'start', 'sence', 'affinity', 'portrait', 'quot', 'young', 'quot', 'Elise', 'realize', 'old', 'woman', 'watch', 'young', 'woman', 'portrait', 'are', 'one', 'same', 'Thus', 'quot', 'quest', 'quot', 'love', 'final', 'scene', 'what', 'quot', 'Sam', 'quot', 'movie', 'quot', 'Ghost', 'quot', 'reuniting', 'loved', 'ones', 'have', 'preceded', 'quot', 'other', 'side', 'quot', 'as', 'simple', 'great', 'way', 'prevent', 'repeating', 'dreaded', 'time-loop', 'thingy', 'events', 'past', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'over-think', 'flick', 'up', 'quot', 'special', 'someone', 'quot', 'keep', 'plenty', 'tissues', 'hand', 'enjoy', 'one', 'GREAT', 'movies', 'out', 'times']",N/A
60657,A2EWN4ANV3CPG6,0783228015,Paul Sayles,"[4, 4]","Somewhere in Time is one of those movies that, while primarily set in 1912, is timeless in it's appeal.  I have watched this movie innumerable times.  It is just one of those magic tales that caught me and has stayed with me ever since.The plot centers on an elderly woman coming to Christopher Reeves's post-production party of a play he has written and giving him a watch and saying 'come back to me'.  Who is she, what does she mean?  From there, Reeve is off on an adventure that will change his life.In the need of a break from writer's block and a failed relation, Reeve goes to the Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island for a night.  He sees a picture of an actress of 1912 and is arrested by her and turns to researching her, plowing through the library searching for information.  He even finds the woman who was her companion in her final days and learns that there is more to the woman than present day information reveals.  A book about traveling through time comes into the mix and Reeve is caught up in the possibility that it presents about going back in time.After more reserach, false starts and frustration, Reeve finally finds himself in 1912 on Mackinac Island and the adventure really starts.The principle actors are excellently casted, Plummer, Reeve and Seymour, but the smaller roles and extras just make the movie that much more entertaining.  One charecter, Arthur appears in both the present as a post social security age hotel worker and also as a 5 year old with a tendency to bounce his ball in the hotel lobby in 1912.  It is a detail like this that makes the movie appealing.The musical score is a tremendous compliment to the film.  Without this score, it might never have made the impact it has over the years.The book from which this movie is adapted is set at the Hotel Del Coronado in San Diego, but I think the Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island is better.  It is a little misleading since Reeve uses a car to get to the hotel and I recall reading that there are only two vehicles, emergency vehicles, on the island.  But that minor point is of no weight to the movie because once you get there, you don't want to leave.  I've been to the Hotel Del and just think the setting in  the Grand is more in keeping with the film.The whole setting, from Reeves bumpy introduction to the world of 1912 through his abrupt departure, is captivating.  His first encounter with a cut throat razor is quite impressive, not to mention Seymour's response to his appearing with a face plastered in toiler paper to stop the blood loss.  The constant surveilance from Plummer, of the two, gives a sinister aspect to the film.  I'm not sure if I dislike Plummer's charecter as a controlling, manipulative manager or like him as a father-figure interested in making sure his daughter isn't hurt.  Each time I see the film, I'm reevaluating Plummer's charecter.  Right now, I rather like him, but that may change.The catastrophe which befalls Reeve and Seymour is at once abrupt and almost inevitable.  No plan is fool proof and a penny is a small item to affect the lives of all involved, but it does.In all, I found this a film of tremendous appeal.  I've seen it countless times and need to get a new tape as the one now is starting to show signs of overuse.  I recommend this to anyone with an interest in &quot;what if ...&quot; films.  I think part of this film's appeal is that it falls into many categories, drama, romance and science fiction, so it has broad based appeal.  This is a fine film, well worth watching and rewatching because you always see something you missed before.",5,I keep coming back to this movie.,1011139200,"01 16, 2002",2002,3596,"['Somewhere', 'Time', 'one', 'movies', 'primarily', 'set', '1912', 'timeless', 'appeal', 'have', 'watched', 'movie', 'innumerable', 'times', 'just', 'one', 'magic', 'tales', 'caught', 'stayed', 'ever', 'since.The', 'plot', 'centers', 'elderly', 'woman', 'coming', 'Christopher', 'Reeves', 'post-production', 'party', 'play', 'written', 'giving', 'watch', 'saying', 'back', 'Who', 'what', 'mean', 'there', 'Reeve', 'off', 'adventure', 'will', 'change', 'life.In', 'need', 'break', 'writer', 'block', 'failed', 'relation', 'Reeve', 'Grand', 'Hotel', 'Mackinac', 'Island', 'night', 'picture', 'actress', '1912', 'arrested', 'researching', 'plowing', 'library', 'searching', 'information', 'even', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'companion', 'final', 'days', 'more', 'woman', 'present', 'day', 'information', 'reveals', 'book', 'traveling', 'time', 'mix', 'Reeve', 'caught', 'up', 'possibility', 'going', 'back', 'time.After', 'more', 'reserach', 'false', 'starts', 'frustration', 'Reeve', 'finally', '1912', 'Mackinac', 'Island', 'adventure', 'really', 'starts.The', 'principle', 'actors', 'are', 'excellently', 'casted', 'Plummer', 'Reeve', 'Seymour', 'smaller', 'roles', 'extras', 'just', 'make', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'entertaining', 'One', 'charecter', 'Arthur', 'present', 'post', 'social', 'security', 'age', 'hotel', 'worker', 'also', '5', 'year', 'old', 'tendency', 'bounce', 'ball', 'hotel', 'lobby', '1912', 'detail', 'movie', 'musical', 'score', 'tremendous', 'compliment', 'film', 'score', 'might', 'never', 'have', 'made', 'impact', 'years.The', 'book', 'movie', 'adapted', 'set', 'Hotel', 'Del', 'Coronado', 'San', 'Diego', 'think', 'Grand', 'Hotel', 'Mackinac', 'Island', 'better', 'little', 'misleading', 'Reeve', 'car', 'get', 'hotel', 'recall', 'reading', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'vehicles', 'emergency', 'vehicles', 'island', 'minor', 'point', 'weight', 'movie', 'once', 'get', 'there', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'leave', ""'ve"", 'been', 'Hotel', 'Del', 'just', 'think', 'setting', 'Grand', 'more', 'keeping', 'film.The', 'whole', 'setting', 'Reeves', 'bumpy', 'introduction', 'world', '1912', 'abrupt', 'departure', 'captivating', 'first', 'encounter', 'cut', 'throat', 'razor', 'quite', 'impressive', 'not', 'mention', 'Seymour', 'response', 'appearing', 'face', 'plastered', 'toiler', 'paper', 'stop', 'blood', 'loss', 'constant', 'surveilance', 'Plummer', 'two', 'sinister', 'aspect', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'dislike', 'Plummer', 'charecter', 'controlling', 'manipulative', 'manager', 'like', 'father-figure', 'interested', 'making', 'sure', 'daughter', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'time', 'see', 'film', ""'m"", 'reevaluating', 'Plummer', 'charecter', 'Right', 'now', 'rather', 'may', 'change.The', 'catastrophe', 'Reeve', 'Seymour', 'once', 'abrupt', 'almost', 'inevitable', 'plan', 'fool', 'proof', 'penny', 'small', 'item', 'affect', 'lives', 'involved', 'found', 'film', 'tremendous', 'appeal', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'countless', 'times', 'need', 'get', 'new', 'tape', 'one', 'now', 'starting', 'show', 'signs', 'overuse', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'interest', 'quot', 'what', 'quot', 'films', 'think', 'part', 'film', 'appeal', 'many', 'categories', 'drama', 'romance', 'science', 'fiction', 'broad', 'based', 'appeal', 'fine', 'film', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'rewatching', 'always', 'see', 'something', 'missed']",N/A

60659,AL8IWEXRY1EWB,0783228015,"P. Connors ""Colonialpara""","[574, 591]","I remember seeing this movie 20 years ago this summer when I was living in Los Angeles and being so taken by it that I sat through it three more times  that night.  The soundtrack haunted me and like Richard Collier in the  movie after he discovers Elise McKenna's picture in the Hall of History, I  could not sleep.  Before the movie left circulation, I'll bet I saw it 30  times.  Everything about this small film grabbed and held me.  There was  the unforgettable story of a love so strong that it transcended time and  place, there was the beautiful setting and there was the evocative and  haunting score by John Barry.  Finally, there was my favorite piece of  classical music;  Variation 18 of Sergei Rachmaninoff's Rhapsody on a Theme  of Paganini, which is probably one of the most romantic pieces of piano  music written in modern times.This is a magical movie and one that  was maligned by critics at the time of its release.  Because it was fantasy  and because the requirement to suspend disbelief was so demanding, it was  dismissed as a four hankie tearjerker.  It wasn't for me and I was a 26  year old single guy hoping that I would experience a love so complete and  so fulfilling.  This movie proved beyond a doubt that such love is possible  and that everyone should seek it and hopefully, find it.This movie  was made on a small budget and yet, it was produced and directed in the  grand tradition of the old Hollywood.  Quality was paramount and they  included great costumes and a wonderful locale to enhance the mood of the  film.  Lighting, music, soft shading all were used to give the viewer the  sense that this was something to be remembered.Very few people saw  this movie in 1980; it was discovered and developed its following on cable  and on video.  I consider myself very fortunate to have seen it when new on  the large screen.  Every penny I paid for admission and all of the hours I  sat hunkered in my seat marveling at Jane Seymour's beauty were aspects of  the movie that only make me love it more.There are so many treats to  this movie that one doesn't know where to begin.  Of all the movies ever  made though, it is one of only two that has a fan club dedicated to its  preservation and enjoyment.  The fan club, which is known as INSITE (for  International Network of Somewhere In Time Enthusiasts) publishes an  extremely high quality quarterly journal and holds several events during  the year to commemorate the members' love for the movie and its cast.  The  editor of the journal, Jo Addie, even appeared as an extra in the movie and  has written eloquently and lovingly of her time as a member of the cast  family.  Through her articles, other members have come to know more about  Jane and Christopher and Elise and Richard and her words have added  immeasurably more to our enjoyment.This is a very special movie and  others have said that.  It is not a perfect movie, but then, none are.  I  am not here to discuss its flaws because whatever they might be, I choose  to overlook them.  This movie grabbed me like few others ever have.  I  doubt many to come ever will again.  Somewhere In Time is a timeless  story because men and women will continue to fall in love long after all of  us here now are gone.  In 500 years, if someone opens a vault and finds a  DVD copy of this movie, they will surely know what it was like to find a  love so all encompassing, so true that one would willingly give up life in  the present to find love in the past.Some would say that Richard  Collier became obsessed with a portrait and perhaps they would be right.  But that doesn't explain the obsession of thousands of fans here and around  the world who have adopted this movie and given it a special place in their  hearts.  It is a credit to the writer Richard Matheson, who adapted his  novel BID TIME RETURN so well that 20 years later, members of INSITE would  launch a campaign to re-release Somewhere In Time.  It is a credit to Reeve  and Seymour that they made their characters so alive that INSITE members  portray them at the annual Somewhere In Time weekend held at the Grand  Hotel on Mackinac Island each Fall.Some have called this the ultimate  Chick Flick.  Well, I'm here to say it's not. This is the kind of movie  that a man, if he is unafraid to admit it, could  sit down alone with and  understand that a relationship, even of short duration could be so all  consuming as to replace the need for anything else.  All throughout this  movie, whenever Reeve and Seymour look at each other, there is a chemistry  and magic that we don't see in the movies made today.  That magic grows  stronger with every viewing for me and I'll bet for all lovers of this film  and its poignant story.Lest you think it's nothing more than romance,  this movie also has some very humorous scenes that creep up on the viewer.  There are very cute scenes where Richard Collier (Reeve) practices what he  will say when he meets Elise McKenna.  There is the scene by the lake where  Richard and Elise first meet and they are both somewhat taken aback before  she says, &quot;Is it you...?&quot;  Then, there is the scene where  Elise McKenna changes the lines she is to say in the play being shown at  the hotel's theater.  She stares dreamily off into the audience and says,  &quot;the man of my dreams has almost faded now...&quot;  Her soliloquy is  probably one of the most well written speeches ever delivered by a  cinematic character.  It is another reason so many fans love this movie  because it is Elise McKenna's confession, her public soul-baring that she  has found the man of her dreams and finally recognized him.  From the  moment Elise finishes her monologue, the viewer knows that Richard and  Elise were meant to be together and nothing will ever keep them apart. Not  distance, not place, not time. They will be together, always.There  is magic and music and a simple wonder to this movie and its timeless  story.  But you know what, don't take my word for it.  Rent it or buy it  and find out why it is one of Universal's best sellers in video.  It was  made 20 years ago and yet, new fans continue to find it.  See it, open your  heart to it and discover yourself why so many people around the world call  it their favorite movie of all time.",5,Excess Within Control...,957830400,"05 9,

From the first I admired the attention to detail in this film.  The reproducion of the world of 1912 is absolutely masterful. Imagine, a  fantasy film without a single special effect or CGI shot. It's almost  unheard of nowadays!I certainly don't think it's the greatest film ever  made. The story could use a bit more depth, and the acting is weak in  places. However, this hasn't stopped it from retaining it's special place  in my heart these past 20 years. The incurably logical minded probably  won't get much out of this picture. It's meant more for those who have a  truely romantic, loving heart. I defy anyone who fits the above discription  NOT to cry like a baby during the last ten minutes!That being said, I  was somewhat dissapointed with the quality of the DVD version. Both the  audio and picture are nowhere near as crisp as other disks in my  collection. While it's nice to have a widescreen copy, this film really  deserves a COLLECTORS EDITION with remastered video and audio, director and  cast commentary tracks, deleted scenes and other goodies that seem to be  part of so many DVD packages these days.

However, we were disappointed.  The film is extremely slow and parts of it make no sense.  Richard Collier travels in time by...a fantastic time machine?  A bolt of lightning?  No.  By HYPNOSIS...how pathetic is that?  He dresses up in old-time clothes and repeats ""I am in 1912,"" over like a zillion times, and BOOM-BAM, he travels in time!  And it just gets stupider.  He falls in love with the woman he thinks he knows (but we never figure out why or what actual time he's really from) after only being with her ONE DAY!  And this is the best part- he is tragically sent back to his own time when he opens his coat pocket and pulls out...A PENNY!  A PENNY FROM 1979, and he is magically whisked back to his own time!  Watch it if you don't believe me!  When he arrives back in his own time and can't return to be with his beloved, he tragically dies...but the good news is, he meets his loved one in heaven.  YAY!  This was a totally stupid and unbelievable film, (for example, why would a refined knockout like Elise McKenna fall in love with a dork like Richard Collier) and I only gave it two stars because my mom and I had a good laugh over it!

60667,A10OS2RVJT7J6W,0783228015,Raymond Sasso,"[2, 2]","I remember the first time I saw this movie back in the early 80's. I had not seen it in the theaters, or remember ever hearing about it, or for a couple years after that even. I first saw this movie when it came out on VHS. I guess I didn't know what to expect, but it looked good so I rented it. I have always been a mushy fan of love stories that goes way back to when I was a young teenager (in love with love). I had worked in movie theaters when I was in college part time, so I got to see a lot of movies, especially film festivals of the older films where romantic movies were always mushy, like for instance Bette Davis in 'Now, Voyager'.When I sat down to watch the movie, it enthralled me. First the idea of time travel. I won't say how many times I dreamt of moving in time...even romantically and this movie fit the bill. I was always so angry with the reviewers for panning this movie so badly! After doing Superman, which was cheesy in its own way, I guess they expected another box office action smash hit and they were let down with a 'love story'! I always said that the reviewers of films had seen so many that they would knit pick everything they could when reviewing a movie. It was then that I lost all faith in reviewers because they made a flop out of 'Somewhere in Time' when it could have had a good opening. I know this also because at the time, I knew Christopher Reeves from a business that I worked at and he was so excited about what we all thought of Superman, yet unless you said something about this movie, he never said anything. When I told him that I adored the movie, he was surprised...and I guess it was because of all the panning he got when it opened, he knew the critics had tore it apart, and that was a shame! He was happy to hear how much I loved it and asked me why...and I told him.To move on, besides romance, fantasy was my other favorite topic and when I have read (a dozen times) 'Time and again', I was utterly fascinated being a NY'er and hearing how NY was back in the 1880's when someone finds a way to go back in time. Or like the most recent one ""Kate and Leopold', which had a time travel-love thing going on, but in reverse. Put them both together in a film like this, and I am utterly enthralled. I don't know how many times I have seen it (stopped counting) I used to tell anyone I could who I know would like it, that they watch it and wouldn't be sorry. Almost everyone I told loved it when they had seen it, which is why I think the critics destroyed the movie. Just like Jeff Shannon's review, they can forgive many things in films they like and tell us to over look it for the main content of the film. But when it comes to this one, they ignore a WHOLE LOT of people who tell them otherwise and still pan the movie after all these years.I have owned this movie on VHS, laser disc and finally DVD. I always have to have it near so when I get the urge to watch something so positively romantic, I have it to watch. No matter how many times I have seen this movie, I never get tired of it. It is so totally romantic and tragic at the same time. You're happy when he does make it back in time (and before he makes it sees his name in the register to prove he made it...and the part where he has to sign it at just the right place as he saw it in the future. I've always wondered why I so loved this movie and found out that, just like in the movie, love conquers all, but most times in death. Maybe that was what made this movie so real to me. It wasn't just a mushy love story with a 'happily ever after' ending but only in his death were they reunited. But I guess also I had always wished someone would love me so deeply that nothing else mattered was always an altruistic dream of mine.Like it or not critics...this movie put a big pie in your face for your bad reviews and has made more money on video than it did at the box office should have woken you up. I guess it did since I bought it 3 times and now maybe a 4th with the special documentary on their look back featurette. And I can say that there are plenty of people out there like me who have done the same and spent money countless times on 'such a panned movie'...so much for reviews and great job people who made this rank so high in the video charts :-)",5,Time is a loop...,1366156800,"04 17, 2013",2013,4284,"['remember', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'movie', 'back', 'early', '80', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'theaters', 'remember', 'ever', 'hearing', 'couple', 'years', 'even', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'VHS', 'guess', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'looked', 'good', 'so', 'rented', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'mushy', 'fan', 'love', 'stories', 'way', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'teenager', 'love', 'love', 'had', 'worked', 'movie', 'theaters', 'when', 'was', 'college', 'part', 'time', 'got', 'see', 'lot', 'movies', 'especially', 'film', 'festivals', 'older', 'films', 'where', 'romantic', 'movies', 'were', 'always', 'mushy', 'instance', 'Bette', 'Davis', ""'Now"", ""Voyager'.When"", 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'movie', 'enthralled', 'First', 'idea', 'time', 'travel', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'dreamt', 'moving', 'time', 'even', 'romantically', 'movie', 'fit', 'bill', 'was', 'always', 'so', 'angry', 'reviewers', 'panning', 'movie', 'so', 'badly', 'doing', 'Superman', 'was', 'cheesy', 'own', 'way', 'guess', 'expected', 'box', 'office', 'action', 'smash', 'hit', 'were', 'let', 'down', ""'love"", 'story', 'always', 'said', 'reviewers', 'films', 'had', 'seen', 'so', 'many', 'would', 'knit', 'pick', 'everything', 'could', 'when', 'reviewing', 'movie', 'was', 'then', 'lost', 'faith', 'reviewers', 'made', 'flop', ""'Somewhere"", 'Time', 'when', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'good', 'opening', 'know', 'also', 'time', 'knew', 'Christopher', 'Reeves', 'business', 'worked', 'was', 'so', 'excited', 'what', 'thought', 'Superman', 'yet', 'said', 'something', 'movie', 'never', 'said', 'anything', 'When', 'told', 'adored', 'movie', 'was', 'surprised', 'guess', 'was', 'panning', 'got', 'when', 'opened', 'knew', 'critics', 'had', 'apart', 'was', 'shame', 'was', 'happy', 'hear', 'how', 'much', 'loved', 'asked', 'why', 'told', 'move', 'romance', 'fantasy', 'was', 'other', 'favorite', 'topic', 'when', 'have', 'read', 'dozen', 'times', ""'Time"", 'again', 'was', 'utterly', 'fascinated', 'being', ""NY'er"", 'hearing', 'how', 'NY', 'was', 'back', '1880', 'when', 'someone', 'way', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'most', 'recent', 'one', 'Kate', 'Leopold', 'had', 'time', 'travel-love', 'thing', 'going', 'reverse', 'Put', 'together', 'film', 'am', 'utterly', 'enthralled', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'have', 'seen', 'stopped', 'counting', 'used', 'tell', 'anyone', 'could', 'who', 'know', 'would', 'like', 'watch', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'sorry', 'Almost', 'everyone', 'told', 'loved', 'when', 'had', 'seen', 'why', 'think', 'critics', 'destroyed', 'movie', 'Just', 'Jeff', 'Shannon', 'review', 'can', 'forgive', 'many', 'things', 'films', 'like', 'tell', 'look', 'main', 'content', 'film', 'when', 'one', 'ignore', 'WHOLE', 'LOT', 'people', 'who', 'tell', 'otherwise', 'still', 'pan', 'movie', 'years.I', 'have', 'owned', 'movie', 'VHS', 'laser', 'disc', 'finally', 'DVD', 'always', 'have', 'have', 'when', 'get', 'urge', 'watch', 'something', 'so', 'positively', 'romantic', 'have', 'watch', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'never', 'get', 'tired', 'so', 'totally', 'romantic', 'tragic', 'same', 'time', ""'re"", 'happy', 'when', 'make', 'back', 'time', 'name', 'register', 'prove', 'made', 'part', 'where', 'sign', 'just', 'right', 'place', 'saw', 'future', ""'ve"", 'always', 'wondered', 'why', 'so', 'loved', 'movie', 'found', 'out', 'just', 'movie', 'love', 'conquers', 'most', 'times', 'death', 'Maybe', 'was', 'what', 'made', 'movie', 'so', 'real', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'mushy', 'love', 'story', ""'happily"", 'ever', 'ending', 'only', 'death', 'were', 'reunited', 'guess', 'also', 'had', 'always', 'wished', 'someone', 'would', 'love', 'so', 'deeply', 'nothing', 'else', 'mattered', 'was', 'always', 'altruistic', 'dream', 'mine.Like', 'not', 'critics', 'movie', 'put', 'big', 'pie', 'face', 'bad', 'reviews', 'made', 'more', 'money', 'video', 'did', 'box', 'office', 'should', 'have', 'woken', 'guess', 'did', 'bought', '3', 'times', 'now', 'maybe', '4th', 'special', 'documentary', 'look', 'back', 'featurette', 'can', 'say', 'are', 'plenty', 'people', 'there', 'who', 'have', 'done', 'same', 'spent', 'money', 'countless', 'times', 'panned', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'reviews', 'great', 'job', 'people', 'who', 'made', 'rank', 'so', 'high', 'video', 'charts']",N/A

Graff,"[1, 1]","Somewhere in Time tells the story of Richard Collier, a successful playwright who shortly after the start of the movie, is suffering from writer's block.  On a whim, he goes to a nearby ritzy hotel to clear his mind.  While there, he sees an old photo of Elise McKenna, a famous actress for her time, who was once a guest at the hotel in 1912.  He is entranced by the beautiful woman, and researches as much about her as he can.  On the way, he realizes she was the woman who gave him a gold pocket watch when he just graduated from college eight years before.  Now so in love with the woman he never really knew, he decides to hypnotize himself into believing he is in 1912 so that he can meet the woman he loves.  The only catch-any reminder of his present time in any way, shape or form will end the hypnosis and take him back.This film is incredibly romantic, and the sweet chemistry between Jane Seymour and Christopher Reeve only heightens it.  Jane Seymour, as Elise, gives the best performance in the film, showing great strength and weakness as her part requires.  The musical score, arguably the best part, is mostly the lovely sounds of piano and orchestra which complement everything wonderfully.  Unfortunately, the film is not perfect.For one thing, some of the acting is a bit wooden and poor.  Reeve may have been a great humanitarian and the definitive Superman, but let's be honest, he was never much of an actor.  The script is not the best written, and the lines being recited just don't sound very natural to real life (such as when Arthur, a supporting character, can somehow name dates on a whim anytime Richard asks.  Finally, there are quite a few plot holes that are hard to ignore (i.e. if any reminder of present time can end the hypnosis, how come Richard's constantly reminding himself he's time traveled doesn't end it?).The flaws are pretty easy to overlook as you get entranced by the film, though.

He gets to see her alright... but in the spirit realm--because he's dead.So, that's what the old lady (who lived her life to  a ripe old age) asked him to do--to kill himself, so that he could spend eternity with her in the spiritual realm.It's a tale (a really big one) about a very selfish old lady and a very stupid young man.This movie is implausible; a man shows up out of the blue and immediately wants to make love to a woman in 1912, and  she's going to allow this to happen--in 1912?

60697,A3IXC749UVCXWF,0783228015,Sabrina M. Messenger,"[1, 1]","Somewhere In Time is refreshing in the way that it doesn't bash you over the head with lots of extreme special effects. It's also a movie that doesn't try to rely on cheap humor, gratuitous violence or graphic depictions of sex in order to get your attention. I especially appreciate the way the love scene was handled in this movie. In my opinion, it was romantic, sensual but yet still very discreet and old fashioned. Very reminiscent of the window scenes in ""Gone with the Wind"" or ""Casablanca""it's nice to leave a little something to the imagination sometimes, isn't it?I thought the actors in SIT played their roles well and in a very believable way. Of course, I loved Jane Seymour in the role of the very elegant stage actress Elise McKenna, and Christopher Plummer was excellent in the role of her very controlling manager William Fawcett Robinson, but it was performance of the late Christopher Reeve as playwright Richard Collier that captured my heart and made me fall in love with this genre. Somewhere in Time was the perfect vehicle for Reeve...and as far as I am concerned, it was the best role he ever played.The Mackinac Island scenery was beautiful, the soundtrack absolutely captivating (it's one I can listen to all the time without ever tiring of it), the dialogue was well written. It was an all around beautiful movie. To me, in spite of what some detractors say about perceived historical errors, alleged continuity mistakes and so- called ""plot holes"" Somewhere in Time is still a masterpiece! As far as I am concerned, it is still BETTER than Gone with the Wind, Citizen Kane, the 1997 version of Titanic or even Casablanca.Why?Because Somewhere in Time is more than just another light entertaining romantic comedy told from only a 21st century female point of view. It is rare to see a serious romantic movie that explores a masculine viewpoint of love and romance (Casablanca is a notable exception). What was really surprising to me is that this movie tends to attract a significant number of men who become die-hard fans! In fact, half of the membership of the fan club, International Network Of Somewhere In Time Enthusiasts (INSITE) are men. Not bad for a flicker that could've been labeled and blown off as just another ""chick's movie!""Somewhere In Time appeals to the intellect as well as to the heart. I consider SIT a ""thinking person's"" movie because it is not a story that allows you to remain complacent in your beliefs. It shakes you up, makes you question things, requires you to take a leap of faith and suspend any pre-conceived notions about the many constructs one forms over the years about a variety of issues. SIT is a drama that brings to you an awareness of the possibility of time travel, an alternative universe and raises your consciousness of the spiritual as well as making you seriously consider the whole idea of whether everyone has a soul mate that is only separated from them by time and space...and whether we are truly controlled by our circumstances, and if we truly have the power to effect change in the way one witnesses in this movie. So is time travel possible? You can research it or you can just take that leap of faith and suspend disbelief while watching this movie. Reeve himself would tell us ""Nothing is impossible"" regarding his belief that he would walk again...in a sense, this movie demonstrated that belief many years before.Whether you like the movie or not, watching it does cause one to think...and part of the reason for movies is to encourage learning, and to explore concepts as well as to entertain. I definitely consider this movie a must-see for the Romantic soul...with special emphasis on the documentary regarding the making of this movie. It has much to tell us and much to make us re-examine our entire concept of the time and space continuum, other laws of physics, philosophy, the supernatural, and yes, even our approaches to romance and love.

The book is a deeply rewarding journey that reaches nuances and depths not present in the screen version, and is worth reading to compare. In the screen adaptation Somewhere in Time, Matheson also served as the screenwriter, lending the movie an unerring fidelity to the original work.Richard Collier (Christopher Reeve in his first role afterSuperman - The Movie) is a modern-day playwright in Chicago. As the film opens at a cast party for his latest work, an elderly woman walks up to him, instantly hushing the celebratory atmosphere, and deposits an engraved pocket watch in his hand, muttering, ""come back to me."" Richard brushes this off as the ravings of a senile woman until later, when a photograph shatters his indifference. Later, Richard seeks a weekend escape at Mackinac Island, Michigan after hitting the wall on his new work.Once checked into the Grand Hotel (one of the world's largest vintage summer resorts, with the world's longest covered patio facing Lake Michigan), he is haunted by the sensual photograph of a beautiful woman in the Grand Hotel's Hall of History, and races to dig up any and all information on the luminous beauty (leading to some fabulous shots of recognizable structures on Mackinac Island). Elise McKenna (Jane Seymour) was a promising young stage actress managed by the dour, possessive W.F. Robinson (Christopher Plummer). Richard toys with the idea of self-hypnosis to travel back to 1912 in order to meet Elise when she was performing at the Grand Hotel, and after several attempts, he succeeds (or is it only the product of a desperate and haunted imagination?), and begins a slow wooing of Elise. Humorous ""fish out of water"" mishaps plague modern-day Richard, including wearing an antique suit that was already an antique by 1912, and the dangers of shaving with a straight razor.The phrase ""love at first sight"" doesn't quite capture the haunting sense of deja vu when Richard first speaks to Elise on the shore of Lake Michigan. A stricken Elise simply asks, ""Is it you?"" and Richard answers yes. It's as though the two have known each other for decades, or at least sensed the other's presence (the mechanics of said time travel, including the ""pocket watch loophole,"" are shaky at best). Their courtship is nearly thwarted by the machinations of the insanely jealous Robinson, who views Elise as his protegee (and property).The bittersweet romance comes to a tragic end, much in the same vein asThe Ghost and Mrs. Muir(which is a very similar ghost love story set in coastal England, but minus the time travel), but ultimately has a fulfilling ending.The cinematography of the 1912 portion is appropriately dreamy, with soft light permeating outdoor shots. The film's soundtrack by John Barry is quite possibly the most romantic I've ever heard, centered around a Rachmaninoff variation on a theme by Paganini.Somewhere In Time (1998 Re-recording)was quite literally the soundtrack of my youth; we would play it on trips to Northern Michigan, and on Mackinac Island in particular. Even if you never see the movie, it's worth purchasing the rerecorded Somewhere In Time soundtrack.Reeve, Seymour, and Plummer all put in heartfelt performances, and the true star of the show is Mackinac Island and the Grand Hotel in particular. Although long valued as a Midwest summer resort, Mackinac Island became an international tourist destination with the cult status of Somewhere in Time.The 20th-anniversary DVD features a one-hour documentary on the making of Somewhere in Time, with new interviews by the late Christopher Reeve (after being paralyzed from the neck down after a horseback accident in 1995), Jane Seymour, Christopher Plummer, and other actors and crewmembers including director Jeannot Szwarc. Also included are cast and crew bios, production stills and notes, an audio commentary by Szwarc (I haven't listened to it yet, so I can't comment), a still photo gallery, the original theatrical trailer, and a segment on INSITE, the International Network of Somewhere in Time Enthusiasts. All in all, the bonus features lend new depth for diehard fans of the movie, but will probably not interest casual fans.",5,"""Come back to me.""",1205366400,"03 13, 2008",2008,4572,"[""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'old', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'beat-up', 'VHS', 'copy', 'Somewhere', 'Time', 'had', 'be', 'several', 'years', 'first', 'visit', 'Mackinac', 'Island', 'age', 'four', 'years', ""'ve"", 'come', 'greatly', 'appreciate', 'nuances', 'standalone', 'merits', 'most', 'gentle', 'unique', 'love', 'story.The', 'charming', 'time-travel', 'love', 'story', 'Somewhere', 'Time', 'based', 'Richard', 'Matheson', 'Bid', 'Time', 'Return', 'book', 'deeply', 'rewarding', 'journey', 'nuances', 'depths', 'not', 'present', 'screen', 'version', 'worth', 'reading', 'compare', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'Somewhere', 'Time', 'Matheson', 'also', 'served', 'screenwriter', 'lending', 'movie', 'unerring', 'fidelity', 'original', 'work.Richard', 'Collier', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'first', 'role', 'afterSuperman', 'Movie', 'modern-day', 'playwright', 'Chicago', 'film', 'cast', 'party', 'latest', 'work', 'elderly', 'woman', 'up', 'instantly', 'hushing', 'celebratory', 'atmosphere', 'engraved', 'pocket', 'watch', 'hand', 'muttering', 'come', 'back', 'Richard', 'off', 'ravings', 'senile', 'woman', 'later', 'when', 'photograph', 'indifference', 'Later', 'Richard', 'weekend', 'escape', 'Mackinac', 'Island', 'Michigan', 'hitting', 'wall', 'new', 'work.Once', 'checked', 'Grand', 'Hotel', 'one', 'world', 'largest', 'vintage', 'summer', 'resorts', 'world', 'longest', 'covered', 'patio', 'facing', 'Lake', 'Michigan', 'haunted', 'sensual', 'photograph', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'Grand', 'Hotel', 'Hall', 'History', 'races', 'dig', 'up', 'information', 'luminous', 'beauty', 'leading', 'fabulous', 'shots', 'recognizable', 'structures', 'Mackinac', 'Island', 'Elise', 'McKenna', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'was', 'promising', 'young', 'stage', 'actress', 'managed', 'dour', 'possessive', 'W.F', 'Robinson', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'Richard', 'idea', 'self-hypnosis', 'travel', 'back', '1912', 'order', 'meet', 'Elise', 'when', 'was', 'performing', 'Grand', 'Hotel', 'several', 'attempts', 'only', 'product', 'desperate', 'haunted', 'imagination', 'slow', 'wooing', 'Elise', 'Humorous', 'fish', 'water', 'mishaps', 'plague', 'modern-day', 'Richard', 'including', 'wearing', 'antique', 'suit', 'was', 'already', 'antique', '1912', 'dangers', 'shaving', 'straight', 'razor.The', 'phrase', 'love', 'first', 'sight', ""n't"", 'quite', 'capture', 'haunting', 'sense', 'deja', 'vu', 'when', 'Richard', 'first', 'Elise', 'shore', 'Lake', 'Michigan', 'A', 'stricken', 'Elise', 'simply', 'Richard', 'answers', 'yes', 'two', 'have', 'known', 'other', 'decades', 'least', 'sensed', 'other', 'presence', 'mechanics', 'said', 'time', 'travel', 'including', 'pocket', 'watch', 'loophole', 'are', 'shaky', 'best', 'courtship', 'nearly', 'thwarted', 'machinations', 'insanely', 'jealous', 'Robinson', 'who', 'Elise', 'protegee', 'property', 'bittersweet', 'romance', 'tragic', 'end', 'much', 'same', 'vein', 'Ghost', 'Mrs.', 'Muir', 'very', 'similar', 'ghost', 'love', 'story', 'set', 'coastal', 'England', 'time', 'travel', 'ultimately', 'fulfilling', 'ending.The', 'cinematography', '1912', 'portion', 'appropriately', 'dreamy', 'soft', 'light', 'permeating', 'outdoor', 'shots', 'film', 'soundtrack', 'John', 'Barry', 'quite', 'possibly', 'most', 'romantic', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'centered', 'Rachmaninoff', 'variation', 'theme', 'Paganini.Somewhere', 'Time', '1998', 'Re-recording', 'was', 'quite', 'literally', 'soundtrack', 'youth', 'would', 'play', 'trips', 'Northern', 'Michigan', 'Mackinac', 'Island', 'particular', 'Even', 'never', 'see', 'movie', 'worth', 'purchasing', 'rerecorded', 'Somewhere', 'Time', 'soundtrack.Reeve', 'Seymour', 'Plummer', 'put', 'heartfelt', 'performances', 'true', 'star', 'show', 'Mackinac', 'Island', 'Grand', 'Hotel', 'particular', 'long', 'valued', 'Midwest', 'summer', 'resort', 'Mackinac', 'Island', 'became', 'international', 'tourist', 'destination', 'cult', 'status', 'Somewhere', 'Time.The', '20th-anniversary', 'DVD', 'one-hour', 'documentary', 'making', 'Somewhere', 'Time', 'new', 'interviews', 'late', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'being', 'paralyzed', 'neck', 'down', 'horseback', 'accident', '1995', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'other', 'actors', 'crewmembers', 'including', 'director', 'Jeannot', 'Szwarc', 'Also', 'included', 'are', 'cast', 'crew', 'bios', 'production', 'stills', 'notes', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Szwarc', 'have', ""n't"", 'listened', 'yet', 'ca', ""n't"", 'comment', 'still', 'photo', 'gallery', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'segment', 'INSITE', 'International', 'Network', 'Somewhere', 'Time', 'Enthusiasts', 'bonus', 'lend', 'new', 'depth', 'diehard', 'fans', 'movie', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'interest', 'casual', 'fans']",N/A

Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour are perfectly cast in the leads with Christopher Plummer in a memorable supporting role.Of all the films to which Jane Seymour has brought grace, this one might be her shining glory. She is effecting and lovely as in this appearance and perfectly cast. Her brief soliloquey on stage is by itself well worth the price of admission.The settings are fantastic -- including the Lake Michigan hotel area -- and costumes, photography and music give added weight to the slight story.  John Barry is a composer of film scores whose work never ceases to please and charm. His signature counterpoint of deep strings responding to the central theme reach the depths of the heart. His contribution here is exacting.However, the towering success of this film is in its managing to bring light to the this elevated plane of a grand romance, so rare that most of us never even see it for ourselves in a lifetime, much less experience it. We all yearn for it. It is the aerial dream of souls that have evolved to subtle levels of discernment.It is for this reason that this film has risen and continues to rise to the level of a cult favorite and far above the heads of its boorish critics.

60709,A1XEFHQZP8Y35W,0783228015,Silver Screen,"[3, 5]","Somewhere in Time is a love story for the true romantic.  It's not just your typical boy meets girl, falls in love, loses girl and reclaims girl.  In this heartbreaking story, the boy must travel thru time in order to get his girl.Christopher Reeve, fresh from Superman, is Richard Collier, a playwright.  When the story first opens, Richard is a college student and his first play has just been produced.  In the audience is an elderly lady, who approaches him after the play's conclusion, puts an antique gold pocketwatch in his hands, and whispers ""Come back to me.""Flash forward to current day (which was then 1980) and Richard is a successful, award-winning playwright living in Chicago, who has hit writer's block with his newest play.  Seeking to clear his head and reclaim his creative juices, he jumps in his car and heads out of the city.  He comes across the Grand Hotel, a real hotel located in Mackinaw Island, Michigan.  The hotel itself is enough to take anyone's breath away and Richard is no different.  He decides to stop there for the evening and while waiting for the hotel's dining room to open, he kills some time in the hotel's hall of history.  While there, he spots a photograph of the actress Elise McKenna, played by the ethereally beautiful Jane Seymour.  He falls in love immediately with her portrait and runs to find Arthur, the elderly hotel bellhop who informs him that Elise McKenna performed in a play at the hotel theater back in 1912.Richard appears crushed but is unable to think of anything but this lovely actress.  The next day he travels to the local library to find out any kind of information on her and is stunned to find the last photograph taken of her - - it's the same elderly woman who presented him with the watch.After a series of meetings, including with the woman who was her last caretaker/companion, Richard comes to believe that he was actually there back in 1912 and met Elise McKenna.  He wills himself back in time, to meet and woo her again, with the constant threat of the present hanging over him, not to mention Elise's overly protective manager, Robinson, who is not about to let any man come between him and his star protege.What makes this movie such a feast for true romantics are several factors.  First, the actors are splendid and perfect for their roles.  In Christopher Reeve's eyes and voice, you can see and hear the longing and love for Jane Seymour, who is so beautiful that you honestly can imagine him falling in love with her portrait.Second, the soundtrack music is heart stopping.  Can anyone hear the theme from this movie and not immediately think of the sweet, yet passionate, love of these characters?Third, the location.  The Grand Hotel deserves to be considered one of the stars of this movie.  The hotel seamlessly transfers from the present day back to 1912 with no problem and no obvious inconsistencies.  The landscaping is lush and the design of the hotel and rooms is done to period perfection.One warning to watching this movie though - - be sure and have a box of tissues handy.  Definitely one for repeated viewings.",5,For the True Romantic,1138060800,"01 24, 2006",2006,3114,"['Somewhere', 'Time', 'love', 'story', 'true', 'romantic', 'not', 'just', 'typical', 'boy', 'meets', 'girl', 'love', 'girl', 'girl', 'heartbreaking', 'story', 'boy', 'must', 'travel', 'thru', 'time', 'order', 'get', 'girl.Christopher', 'Reeve', 'fresh', 'Superman', 'Richard', 'Collier', 'playwright', 'When', 'story', 'first', 'Richard', 'college', 'student', 'first', 'play', 'just', 'been', 'produced', 'audience', 'elderly', 'lady', 'who', 'play', 'conclusion', 'antique', 'gold', 'pocketwatch', 'hands', 'whispers', 'Come', 'back', 'Flash', 'forward', 'current', 'day', 'was', 'then', '1980', 'Richard', 'successful', 'award-winning', 'playwright', 'living', 'Chicago', 'who', 'hit', 'writer', 'block', 'newest', 'play', 'Seeking', 'clear', 'head', 'reclaim', 'creative', 'juices', 'car', 'city', 'Grand', 'Hotel', 'real', 'hotel', 'located', 'Mackinaw', 'Island', 'Michigan', 'hotel', 'enough', 'take', 'anyone', 'breath', 'away', 'Richard', 'different', 'stop', 'evening', 'waiting', 'hotel', 'dining', 'room', 'open', 'time', 'hotel', 'hall', 'history', 'there', 'spots', 'photograph', 'actress', 'Elise', 'McKenna', 'played', 'ethereally', 'beautiful', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'love', 'immediately', 'portrait', 'find', 'Arthur', 'elderly', 'hotel', 'bellhop', 'who', 'Elise', 'McKenna', 'performed', 'play', 'hotel', 'theater', 'back', '1912.Richard', 'crushed', 'unable', 'think', 'anything', 'lovely', 'actress', 'next', 'day', 'local', 'library', 'find', 'out', 'kind', 'information', 'stunned', 'find', 'last', 'photograph', 'taken', 'same', 'elderly', 'woman', 'who', 'presented', 'watch.After', 'series', 'meetings', 'including', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'last', 'caretaker/companion', 'Richard', 'believe', 'was', 'actually', 'back', '1912', 'met', 'Elise', 'McKenna', 'back', 'time', 'meet', 'woo', 'again', 'constant', 'threat', 'present', 'hanging', 'not', 'mention', 'Elise', 'overly', 'protective', 'manager', 'Robinson', 'who', 'not', 'let', 'man', 'come', 'star', 'protege.What', 'movie', 'feast', 'true', 'romantics', 'are', 'several', 'factors', 'First', 'actors', 'are', 'splendid', 'perfect', 'roles', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'eyes', 'voice', 'can', 'see', 'hear', 'longing', 'love', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'who', 'so', 'beautiful', 'honestly', 'can', 'imagine', 'falling', 'love', 'portrait.Second', 'soundtrack', 'music', 'heart', 'stopping', 'Can', 'anyone', 'hear', 'theme', 'movie', 'not', 'immediately', 'think', 'sweet', 'yet', 'passionate', 'love', 'characters', 'Third', 'location', 'Grand', 'Hotel', 'be', 'considered', 'one', 'stars', 'movie', 'hotel', 'seamlessly', 'transfers', 'present', 'day', 'back', '1912', 'problem', 'obvious', 'inconsistencies', 'landscaping', 'lush', 'design', 'hotel', 'rooms', 'done', 'period', 'perfection.One', 'warning', 'watching', 'movie', 'be', 'sure', 'have', 'box', 'tissues', 'handy', 'Definitely', 'one', 'repeated', 'viewings']",N/A

60721,A3VC1CIRFDXJAY,0783228015,"Teresa ""SWEETHEART""","[0, 0]","This movie touched my heart! It was a beautiful love story, that transcends time, and it is about a handsome, modern day playwright, who falls in love with a photographed painting, of a very beautiful woman, who lived in 1912!I loved Richard Collier's handsome self! Christopher Reeve (Richard Collier), was so good looking and handsome, and so full of charm, this is the type of man that can take a women's breath away, by just being near him! Richard feels so empty in his life, as a famous playwright, until he takes a vacation, and sees the painting of Elise! Elise was a very famous actress in her day! Richard can't get the picture of Elise out of his mind, and then Richard finds a way to travel thur time, so that he can meet Elise! During Richard's research, he also finds out that in his modern present day life, that he has already met Elise, when she was old, and at that time, he did not know who she was! But she immediately knew, who Richard was, and she even spoke to him!I loved the scene where Richard and Elise ( Jane Seymour) meet when Elise was young, while she is walking by the lake! I thought Jane was perfect for this part, she was so beautiful! I also loved the scene where Richard came to Elise's room to ask her to take a walk with him! I also loved Elise's beautiful clothes, and hats, and I loved the way she did her long, pretty hair!In this movie I so loved ,the heartfelt emotion, and passion, that Richard and Elise had for each other, it was so profound! I loved the chemisty between Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour. The theatre scene where Elise yearns for a man to touch the secret regions of her heart was awesome! And one small scene that really touched my heart, was the scene showing, how that photograped painting of Elise was made, that Richard fell so in love with, Wow!I also loved , the beautiful, soul stirring music to this movie, it says it all! I thought all the actors in this movie did a outstanding job, especially Christopher Plummer, (Elise's manager, and mentor)! You will need tissues for this movie, I have seen it many times, over the years, and I cry each time!

60722,A3TFFSO47Z3BX8,0783228015,"The Bluto ""adncjs3""","[19, 20]","During it's release in 1980, &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot; was virtually ingnored by film audiences and widely panned by critics stating that the film was &quot;too sentimental&quot; and too corny.  I was a child when the film was first released so my only interest in viewing the film on cable was that &quot;Superman was in it and it's about time travel!&quot;.  But what I saw was an innocent and sweet hearted film about love against all odds.  Viewing the film as an adult, I find the film even more touching and sad.First the acting by Jane Seymore and Christopher Plummer is first rate.  I was suprised that Plummer was not nominated for a Best Supporting Oscar.  Christopher Reeve I believe recieved harsh criticism in 1980 for portraying a man completely vulnerable and desperate to find his one true love.  I believe post 1970's audiences and critics found his performance too corny while I found it true and earnest.  Reeve makes this film stronger than it would if it were cast with someone else.  His character has such conviction in love that he's able to travel through time with just his mind!  Reeve's performance makes that believeable.  I also believe it is because of Reeve that the film endures.  For Reeve fans this film may be more popular than even the first &quot;Superman&quot; film.I cannot continue praise for this film without mentioning the music by John Barry.  His theme for &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot; is both haunting and sweet and sets a perfect tone for this movie.  The &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot; theme may be one of the most recognized movie themes ever.I am pleased to find that this film has found a new popularity.  I believe that this film began a trend of more sentimental love stories which became very popular in the 80's and 90's.  Which brings me to a certain observation.  There are many similarities between this film and another tragic love story released in 1997.  THAT film became the highest grossing film in history, and it dealt with the same subject matter as &quot;Somewhere..&quot;  Both &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot; and &quot;Titanic&quot; begin with an old lady thinking about the past, both films are set in 1912, the heroines in both films have a domineering figure in their lives, their love affair with the hero is brief but lasts forever, the heroes of both films die, and at the end of both films the lovers are reunited in a heavenly afterlife.I feel it unfortunate that &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot; couldn't find praise when it was first released by film audiences as &quot;Titanic&quot; had.  But just as the characters found love years later in the film, people eventually found this film and fell in love with it and it will continue to touch people.",5,This film was made at the wrong time.,974592000,"11 19, 2000",2000,2728,"['release', '1980', 'quot', 'Somewhere', 'Time', 'quot', 'was', 'virtually', 'ingnored', 'film', 'audiences', 'widely', 'panned', 'critics', 'stating', 'film', 'was', 'quot', 'too', 'sentimental', 'quot', 'too', 'corny', 'was', 'child', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'so', 'only', 'interest', 'viewing', 'film', 'cable', 'was', 'quot', 'Superman', 'was', 'time', 'travel', 'quot', 'what', 'saw', 'was', 'innocent', 'sweet', 'hearted', 'film', 'love', 'odds', 'Viewing', 'film', 'adult', 'find', 'film', 'even', 'more', 'touching', 'sad.First', 'acting', 'Jane', 'Seymore', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'first', 'rate', 'was', 'suprised', 'Plummer', 'was', 'not', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Oscar', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'believe', 'recieved', 'harsh', 'criticism', '1980', 'portraying', 'man', 'completely', 'vulnerable', 'desperate', 'find', 'one', 'true', 'love', 'believe', 'post', '1970', 'audiences', 'critics', 'found', 'performance', 'too', 'corny', 'found', 'true', 'earnest', 'Reeve', 'film', 'stronger', 'would', 'were', 'cast', 'someone', 'else', 'character', 'such', 'conviction', 'love', 'able', 'travel', 'time', 'just', 'mind', 'Reeve', 'performance', 'believeable', 'also', 'believe', 'Reeve', 'film', 'endures', 'Reeve', 'fans', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'popular', 'even', 'first', 'quot', 'Superman', 'quot', 'film.I', 'can', 'not', 'continue', 'praise', 'film', 'mentioning', 'music', 'John', 'Barry', 'theme', 'quot', 'Somewhere', 'Time', 'quot', 'haunting', 'sweet', 'perfect', 'tone', 'movie', 'quot', 'Somewhere', 'Time', 'quot', 'theme', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'recognized', 'movie', 'themes', 'ever.I', 'am', 'pleased', 'find', 'film', 'found', 'new', 'popularity', 'believe', 'film', 'began', 'trend', 'more', 'sentimental', 'love', 'stories', 'became', 'very', 'popular', '80', '90', 'Which', 'certain', 'observation', 'are', 'many', 'similarities', 'film', 'tragic', 'love', 'story', 'released', '1997', 'film', 'became', 'highest', 'grossing', 'film', 'history', 'same', 'subject', 'matter', 'quot', 'Somewhere..', 'quot', 'Both', 'quot', 'Somewhere', 'Time', 'quot', 'quot', 'Titanic', 'quot', 'begin', 'old', 'lady', 'thinking', 'past', 'films', 'are', 'set', '1912', 'heroines', 'films', 'have', 'domineering', 'figure', 'lives', 'love', 'affair', 'hero', 'brief', 'forever', 'heroes', 'films', 'die', 'end', 'films', 'lovers', 'are', 'reunited', 'heavenly', 'afterlife.I', 'feel', 'unfortunate', 'quot', 'Somewhere', 'Time', 'quot', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'praise', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'film', 'audiences', 'quot', 'Titanic', 'quot', 'had', 'just', 'characters', 'found', 'love', 'years', 'later', 'film', 'people', 'eventually', 'found', 'film', 'fell', 'love', 'will', 'continue', 'touch', 'people']",N/A

60733,A3KXV8AFQ550DY,0783228015,Wayne C. Rogers,"[0, 0]","Somewhere In Time (originally published in novel format as Bid Time Return by the great horror writer, Richard Matheson), starring the late Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour, has become a cult classic during the last twenty-six years.  I think it was the second or third movie that Christopher Reeve did after Superman.  Next to Superman, this is probably the other movie that most fans remember him for.  Though tall and extremely handsome, there was a slight awkwardness to his acting in this film, which fortunately turned out to be perfect for the character he was portraying.  Jane Seymour never looked beautiful as she does in this movie.  I think it made every man who saw it want to travel back in time just to be with her.The story (beware of plot spoilers) deals with Richard Collier, a young playwright in college who has just seen his first play successfully performed and is backstage, celebrating with the rest of the cast and crew.  Everything is interrupted when an elderly, yet very elegant, woman moves through the crowd of people and silently approaches him.  She takes his hand and places an antique pocket watch in it, and then says only four words: ""Come back to me.""  The elderly lady returns home that night and dies.  The movie then jumps ahead several years to when Collier is now a world-renown playwright, living in Chicago.  He's just broken up with his girlfriend, plus he's having trouble completing his newest play.  He decides at the spur of the moment to hop in his car and to take off for a few days, hoping this will help him to regroup.  His journey leads him to the beautiful Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island in northern Michigan, where he decides to stay for a day or two.  While waiting for the hotel's restaurant to open on his first evening there, he takes a tour through the hotel's Walk of History and sees a photograph of the lovely, breath-taking stage actress, Elise McKenna (played by the lovely Jane Seymour) , who performed at the hotel in 1912.  Collier finds himself mesmerized by the photograph.  He can't stop thinking about the woman in it.  It's almost as if he's fallen in love with her.  Wanting to find out more about her, he makes a trip to the public library and discovers that Elise McKenna was the elderly lady who gave him the pocket watch.  This leads him to investigate the hotel's old registers.  Collier finds out that he stayed at the hotel in 1912.  Though it seems impossible, he accepts the facts that are presented to him.  The only question now is how to return to 1912 and to the woman he loves.Somewhere In Time is definitely a tearjerker in the biggest sense.  If you have a sensitive heart, you can't help but be moved by this film.  It still brings tears to my eyes, and I've seen it over twenty times.  The music to the movie is hauntingly beautiful and was done by none other than John Barry, who's more famous for his soundtracks to many of the ""James Bond"" films.  This movie has so many fans that they actually get together every year at the Grand Hotel to relive the film and to have a big party where they all dress up in the style of clothing that was popular in 1912.

60740,A3BZ0BNK9CXU8Z,0783228015,WyldCherry,"[5, 7]","I first saw it on TV. at age 5.  It was one of those late night movies they show on the weekends.  I had the chicken pox which allowed me the privilege to stay up late.  At first, I had no interest in the movie because I was (and still is) an action/adventure type movie go'er.  Yet, the idea of time travel had its appeal and drew me in. (Also due to the fact, that I couldn't reach the remote control!) So, I watched the movie and I actually enjoyed it. (Although, the ending was a bit tragic.) Thus, ""Somewhere in Time"" became on of my favorite mushy, lovey-dovey, chick-flicks!The plot is rather simple(heh heh). A guy meets a mysterious old lady in the present (well during the 1970's). She gives the guy something and tells him to ""Come back to her!""  The guy is like what the '----' who is this chick (paraphrasing here) and like whatever!. Some years later, the guy gets dumped (I think?) and is suffering from play writer's block. So, the man goes to a nice hotel that was there since the early 1900's for inspiration for his play. The hotel--incidentally--has a history museum and the guy decides look around. Then low and behold, the dude sees a picture of this bodacious babe. He finds out that the chick in the pic was non-other than the mysterious old lady that he met years ago! Like totally weird! The guy gets totally obsessed with the bodacious babe in the picture and tries to find out anything and everything about her. This does not help cease his 'thing' for this girl and he wants to be with her.  Question is, how?  She's long gone and in the past while he is stuck in the 80's. Hmmm, well time travel seems like a good (but whacked) idea! So, our love sick playwright opposes all the laws of classical physics--without a Dalorian (sp?? Back to the Future)and his ""Superman"" powers (the 'reverse the earth's rotation thingy')--in order to be with the love of his life! The rest of the story is pretty much history. I don't want to give too much away (probably did)to those who have not watch the movie!Yeah, story is a bit corny (and vague) at times, but it has its 'oh that was so romantic' parts in it that would sweep anyone off his/her feet. The actors and actresses in this movie did a good job in their roles.  Christopher Reeves was charming and fit his character well. Also, Jane Seymore made and excellent Elise.  The costumes that were used were pretty cool (especially Elise's awesome dresses).  Plus, for all those Rachmaninof fans out there (like I am), you'll love the score. Hey, Rachmaninof and romance go together and this is a romance flick. So, if you watched the movie and liked it, then kudos for you! Might as well get the movie. Might as well get it on DVD. I did! Also, if you didn't see this movie, then go see it. However, beware of the ending. It is sad. Just as sad as the ""City of Angels"" chick, that got hit by a truck after getting it on with the cute angel dude!  (What an idiot! Sorry that movie just ticks me off! Maybe, I should review it!) Then, after you've seen the movie, write a review for it on Amazon.com.

Instead of boring viewers with time-travel technobabble explanations, though, ""Somewhere In Time"" uses it only as a plot device, not the MAIN event.  Essentially, the core of the movie has very little to do with time-travel...time-travel is only the vehicle through which the story can come forward.I will not reveal any plot details, so as not to spoil your experience with this film, but the plot is very engaging.  It will have romantics reaching for the tissue box and less-romantic viewers marveling at the subtle plot nuances.The acting in this film is also terrific.  Christopher Reeve is spot-on as a ""normal guy"" (much like his Clark Kent of ""Superman"" fame) who does his best under abnormal circumstances, while Jane Seymour is the epitome of classical beauty.Overall, this is a film that everyone can enjoy.
