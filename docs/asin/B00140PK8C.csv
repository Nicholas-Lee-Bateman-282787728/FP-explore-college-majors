1144797,A3JDWL4YWJMIS0,B00140PK8C,B. Percell,"[1, 2]","Simply put, Cybill was a great show. The comedy was well written. It was funny without being overly stupid. The cast had a great chemistry and Christine Baranski was nothing less than hilarious as Cybill's buddy Mary Ann. They deserve better treatment than what they've been given on dvd in the states. I will never be able to understand the moronic thinking behind American video releases. Foreign countries have had access to some of our t.v. shows long before we ever did. In some cases; i.e. Six Million Dollar Man, Bionic Woman, it took years for us to catch up. That makes no sense at all to me. We're supposed to be the greatest country in the world and yet we can't even purchase simple things like dvd's of shows that are wholly native to this country? It's pathetic, not to mention infuriating. And we shouldn't have to go out and buy all region players and order dvd's from other continents just to be able to watch these shows. Okay, some of you are saying geez, dude, lighten up it's just a t.v. show. Fair enough, but I stand by that old saying, ""it's the principle of the thing."" As viewers of these shows, as Americans who made these shows popular, and therefore kept them on television long enough to even have complete seasons in the first place, we have a right to expect them to be available to us, just as they are to the rest of the world. That's not too much to ask. And another thing...this show, like all others, is best seen as whole cloth, not some patchwork crap that's thrown together and doesn't match. The episodes should be presented uncut and in order. This release is disrespectful to the people who worked on this show and the people who are fans.",1,"5 Stars for the show, 1 Star for this crappy release.",1330041600,"02 24, 2012",2012,1682,"['Simply', 'put', 'Cybill', 'was', 'great', 'show', 'comedy', 'was', 'well', 'written', 'was', 'funny', 'being', 'overly', 'stupid', 'cast', 'had', 'great', 'chemistry', 'Christine', 'Baranski', 'was', 'nothing', 'less', 'hilarious', 'Cybill', 'buddy', 'Mary', 'Ann', 'deserve', 'better', 'treatment', 'what', ""'ve"", 'been', 'given', 'dvd', 'states', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'able', 'understand', 'moronic', 'thinking', 'American', 'video', 'releases', 'Foreign', 'countries', 'have', 'had', 'access', 't.v', 'shows', 'long', 'ever', 'did', 'cases', 'i.e', 'Six', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Man', 'Bionic', 'Woman', 'took', 'years', 'catch', 'up', 'sense', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'be', 'greatest', 'country', 'world', 'yet', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'purchase', 'simple', 'things', 'dvd', 'shows', 'are', 'wholly', 'native', 'country', 'pathetic', 'not', 'mention', 'infuriating', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'go', 'out', 'buy', 'region', 'players', 'order', 'dvd', 'other', 'continents', 'just', 'be', 'able', 'watch', 'shows', 'Okay', 'are', 'saying', 'geez', 'dude', 'up', 'just', 't.v', 'show', 'Fair', 'enough', 'stand', 'old', 'saying', 'principle', 'thing', 'viewers', 'shows', 'Americans', 'who', 'made', 'shows', 'popular', 'therefore', 'kept', 'television', 'long', 'enough', 'even', 'have', 'complete', 'seasons', 'first', 'place', 'have', 'right', 'expect', 'be', 'available', 'just', 'are', 'rest', 'world', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'ask', 'thing', 'show', 'others', 'best', 'seen', 'whole', 'cloth', 'not', 'patchwork', 'crap', 'thrown', 'together', ""n't"", 'match', 'episodes', 'should', 'be', 'presented', 'uncut', 'order', 'release', 'disrespectful', 'people', 'who', 'worked', 'show', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'fans']",Cybill: The Volume 1
1144798,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B00140PK8C,Byron Kolln,"[1, 1]","Following up her acclaimed role in ""Moonlighting"" was never going to be an easy task, but in 1995 Cybill Shepherd returned with the zany TV sitcom, CYBILL.  Shepherd plays Cybill Sheridan, a middle-aged actress in Los Angeles whose career has never really advanced past commercials/Movie of the Week/After-School Special status.  Living with her sharp-witted teen daughter Zoey (Alicia Witt) in a mansion perched on a crumbling L.A. hillside, Cybill's private life is just as chaotic and muddled as her career....  Two ex-husbands (Tom Wopat and Alan Rosenberg) still make themselves at home, whether she wants them or not!  Eldest daughter Rachel (Dedee Pfeiffer) is married to an uptight college professor (Peter Krause).  Finally there's Cybill's best friend, divorced multi-millionaire socialite Maryann Thorpe (Christine Baranski), a woman who has only one goal in life...to make her ex-husband Dr. Dick's life a total hell!CYBILL ran for four seasons, garnering praise for it's stars and sharp writing.  Cybill gamely plays for laughs as a character who'd seem uncomfortably close to what an actress of Shepherd's age may indeed have first-hand experiences of.  Early seasons saw the character of Maryann get the biggest laughs and funniest storylines, and Ms Baranski gives her all in the part.  Maryann was softened somewhat in later seasons, at least in part because Ms Shepherd felt she was being upstaged by her co-star and tensions on the set started to get out of hand.  CYBILL was cancelled by CBS after the fourth season, depite leaving the characters' stories unresolved (the last episode sees Cybill and Maryann going to jail after a prank on Dr. Dick literally backfires).  I do feel there was more to be mined in the show, and it could have happily continued but perhaps the rivalry between Shepherd and Baranski was becoming too much.Complete season sets of CYBILL have been released in the United Kingdom (where CYBILL still enjoys a very large and dedicated following).  Hopefully they will also eventually get released locally in the States, but until then, this ""best of"" collection will have to be sufficient for CYBILL's American fanbase.Includes the following episodes:""The Last Temptation of Cybill"" - Cybill is busy rehearsing a romantic new play with Rick (guest star Kevin Sorbo) who begins taking his role into reality.  Maryann delights in spying on her movie star neighbours with a telescope.""Local Hero"" - Who knew Cybill was the most popular TV star in Eastern Europe?  ""Island Cop"" re-runs propel Cybill into an evening with some of her biggest fans.""Educating Zoey"" - Cybill and Ira wonder what went wrong when they discover that college isn't on the list for Zoey's future education.""Pal Zoey"" - Cybill is thrilled when Zoey decides to take a new page in their relationship.  Meanwhile, Maryann decides to make Ira jealous by flirting with Cybill's visiting cousin.""Bringing Home the Bacon"" - Cybill the pig liberator?  Cybill rescues the star of her latest acting gig from ending up on the dinner plate.""Cybill Does Diary"" - Cybill and Maryann decide to produce a women-friendly erotic movie but it's Zoey's diary that becomes the hot news.""Kiss Me, You Fool"" - Cybill and her ex-husband Jeff co-star in a big action blockbuster.""Where's a Harpoon When You Need One?"" - Cybill is called away as part of her role in a cruiseship campaign, just when Dr. Dick ramps up his plan to win back an emotionally-vulnerable Maryann.""Show Me the Minnie"" - Cybill needs cash when her garage collapses and must arrange for expensive reconstructive work...but when her loan officer turns out to be crazed former Cybill Fan Club president Minnie Arbogast (Paula Poundstone), what are her chances?""Going to Hell in a Limo (Part 1)"" - Cybill lands a role on the new science fiction series ""Lifeforms"".""Valentine's Day"" - Maryann becomes concerned when it looks like things are getting serious between her son Justin (Danny Masterson) and Zoey.""The Golden Years"" - It's a spooky glimpse into the future when we see an elderly Cybill and Maryann as they recall their past romances via an old diary.""Ka-Boom"" - Cybill's show is getting canned, and Maryann could be out on the street when Dr. Dick walks away with her life savings.",4,zany comedy treat,1278374400,"07 6, 2010",2010,4249,"['Following', 'up', 'acclaimed', 'role', 'Moonlighting', 'was', 'never', 'going', 'be', 'easy', 'task', '1995', 'Cybill', 'Shepherd', 'returned', 'zany', 'TV', 'sitcom', 'CYBILL', 'Shepherd', 'Cybill', 'Sheridan', 'middle-aged', 'actress', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'career', 'never', 'really', 'advanced', 'commercials/Movie', 'Week/After-School', 'Special', 'status', 'Living', 'sharp-witted', 'teen', 'daughter', 'Zoey', 'Alicia', 'Witt', 'mansion', 'perched', 'crumbling', 'L.A.', 'hillside', 'Cybill', 'private', 'life', 'just', 'chaotic', 'muddled', 'career', 'Two', 'ex-husbands', 'Tom', 'Wopat', 'Alan', 'Rosenberg', 'still', 'make', 'home', 'not', 'Eldest', 'daughter', 'Rachel', 'Dedee', 'Pfeiffer', 'married', 'uptight', 'college', 'professor', 'Peter', 'Krause', 'Finally', 'Cybill', 'best', 'friend', 'divorced', 'multi-millionaire', 'socialite', 'Maryann', 'Thorpe', 'Christine', 'Baranski', 'woman', 'who', 'only', 'one', 'goal', 'life', 'make', 'ex-husband', 'Dr.', 'Dick', 'life', 'total', 'hell', 'CYBILL', 'ran', 'four', 'seasons', 'garnering', 'praise', 'stars', 'sharp', 'writing', 'Cybill', 'gamely', 'laughs', 'character', 'who', ""'d"", 'seem', 'uncomfortably', 'close', 'what', 'actress', 'Shepherd', 'age', 'may', 'indeed', 'have', 'first-hand', 'experiences', 'Early', 'seasons', 'saw', 'character', 'Maryann', 'get', 'biggest', 'laughs', 'funniest', 'storylines', 'Ms', 'Baranski', 'part', 'Maryann', 'was', 'softened', 'somewhat', 'later', 'seasons', 'least', 'part', 'Ms', 'Shepherd', 'felt', 'was', 'being', 'upstaged', 'co-star', 'tensions', 'set', 'started', 'get', 'hand', 'CYBILL', 'was', 'cancelled', 'CBS', 'fourth', 'season', 'depite', 'leaving', 'characters', 'stories', 'unresolved', 'last', 'episode', 'sees', 'Cybill', 'Maryann', 'going', 'jail', 'prank', 'Dr.', 'Dick', 'literally', 'do', 'feel', 'was', 'more', 'be', 'mined', 'show', 'could', 'have', 'happily', 'continued', 'perhaps', 'rivalry', 'Shepherd', 'Baranski', 'was', 'becoming', 'too', 'much.Complete', 'season', 'sets', 'CYBILL', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'United', 'Kingdom', 'where', 'CYBILL', 'still', 'very', 'large', 'dedicated', 'following', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'also', 'eventually', 'get', 'released', 'locally', 'States', 'then', 'best', 'collection', 'will', 'have', 'be', 'sufficient', 'CYBILL', 'American', 'following', 'episodes', 'Last', 'Temptation', 'Cybill', 'Cybill', 'busy', 'rehearsing', 'romantic', 'new', 'play', 'Rick', 'guest', 'star', 'Kevin', 'Sorbo', 'who', 'taking', 'role', 'reality', 'Maryann', 'delights', 'spying', 'movie', 'star', 'neighbours', 'telescope', 'Local', 'Hero', 'Who', 'knew', 'Cybill', 'was', 'most', 'popular', 'TV', 'star', 'Eastern', 'Europe', 'Island', 'Cop', 're-runs', 'propel', 'Cybill', 'evening', 'biggest', 'fans', 'Educating', 'Zoey', 'Cybill', 'Ira', 'wonder', 'went', 'wrong', 'when', 'discover', 'college', ""n't"", 'list', 'Zoey', 'future', 'education', 'Pal', 'Zoey', 'Cybill', 'thrilled', 'when', 'Zoey', 'take', 'new', 'page', 'relationship', 'Meanwhile', 'Maryann', 'make', 'Ira', 'jealous', 'flirting', 'Cybill', 'visiting', 'cousin', 'Bringing', 'Home', 'Bacon', 'Cybill', 'pig', 'liberator', 'Cybill', 'star', 'latest', 'acting', 'gig', 'ending', 'up', 'dinner', 'plate', 'Cybill', 'Does', 'Diary', 'Cybill', 'Maryann', 'decide', 'produce', 'women-friendly', 'erotic', 'movie', 'Zoey', 'diary', 'hot', 'news', 'Kiss', 'Me', 'Fool', 'Cybill', 'ex-husband', 'Jeff', 'co-star', 'big', 'action', 'blockbuster', 'Where', 'Harpoon', 'When', 'Need', 'One', 'Cybill', 'called', 'away', 'part', 'role', 'cruiseship', 'campaign', 'just', 'when', 'Dr.', 'Dick', 'up', 'plan', 'win', 'back', 'emotionally-vulnerable', 'Maryann', 'Show', 'Me', 'Minnie', 'Cybill', 'cash', 'when', 'garage', 'collapses', 'must', 'arrange', 'expensive', 'reconstructive', 'work', 'when', 'loan', 'officer', 'out', 'be', 'crazed', 'former', 'Cybill', 'Fan', 'Club', 'president', 'Minnie', 'Arbogast', 'Paula', 'Poundstone', 'what', 'are', 'chances', 'Going', 'Hell', 'Limo', 'Part', '1', 'Cybill', 'role', 'new', 'science', 'fiction', 'series', 'Lifeforms', 'Valentine', 'Day', 'Maryann', 'becomes', 'concerned', 'when', 'things', 'are', 'getting', 'serious', 'son', 'Justin', 'Danny', 'Masterson', 'Zoey', 'Golden', 'Years', 'spooky', 'glimpse', 'future', 'when', 'see', 'elderly', 'Cybill', 'Maryann', 'recall', 'past', 'romances', 'old', 'diary', 'Ka-Boom', 'Cybill', 'show', 'getting', 'canned', 'Maryann', 'could', 'be', 'out', 'street', 'when', 'Dr.', 'Dick', 'away', 'life', 'savings']",Cybill: The Volume 1

Thus, that may explain also why you haven't been as lucky as British fans who were exempt from these problems and now have DVD sets of SEASON 1, 2 and 3!Before I go, I should say SEASON 2 is for me one of my favourites for the fact that Cybill manages to sneak in quite a few songs.

1144805,A2H6HSTMNWG9RR,B00140PK8C,Robert L. Frazier,"[46, 47]","""Cybill"" was one of my favorite shows from the mid-90's and was one of the funniest, most under-rated sitcoms of all-time.  Cybill Shepherd was essentially playing herself, Cybill Sheridan, a one-time beauty queen and semi-famous Hollywood actress who's been married a couple of times with children from both marriages and is now over 40 and finding it more difficult to get the acting roles she used to get when she was a young ingenue.Christine Baranski plays her best friend - boozy, over-the-top, cynical, socialite, Maryanne Thorpe, which deservedly won her a Best Supporting Actress Emmy and was the prototype for Megan Mullally's Karen Walker character on ""Will & Grace"".  The talented supporting cast is rounded out by Alan Rosenberg and Tom Wopat who play her ex-husbands, Ira and Jeff; and Alicia Witt and Deeded Pfeiffer who play her daughters, Zoey and Rachel. Although the ""Cybill"" show only last four seasons on CBS, and I wish we could get the complete seasons on DVD, this is the next best thing.Although it was described by some critics as a ""Lucy and Ethel for the 90's"" it's really much more than that.  At it's best, ""Cybill"" throws a humorous light on what it's like to an actress over 40 struggling to maintain a career in Hollywood while still juggling being a mother, ex-husbands and finding romance.  With it's sharp, witty dialogue and cast of zany characters - especially the outrageous Christine Baranski - it's more similiar to ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"".",5,"Finally, the ""Cybill"" show is coming to DVD!",1203984000,"02 26, 2008",2008,1485,"['Cybill', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'shows', 'mid-90', 'was', 'one', 'funniest', 'most', 'under-rated', 'sitcoms', 'all-time', 'Cybill', 'Shepherd', 'was', 'essentially', 'playing', 'Cybill', 'Sheridan', 'one-time', 'beauty', 'queen', 'semi-famous', 'Hollywood', 'actress', 'who', 'been', 'married', 'couple', 'times', 'children', 'marriages', 'now', '40', 'finding', 'more', 'difficult', 'get', 'acting', 'used', 'get', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'ingenue.Christine', 'Baranski', 'best', 'friend', 'boozy', 'over-the-top', 'cynical', 'socialite', 'Maryanne', 'Thorpe', 'deservedly', 'won', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'Emmy', 'was', 'prototype', 'Megan', 'Mullally', 'Karen', 'Walker', 'character', 'Will', 'Grace', 'talented', 'supporting', 'cast', 'rounded', 'out', 'Alan', 'Rosenberg', 'Tom', 'Wopat', 'who', 'play', 'ex-husbands', 'Ira', 'Jeff', 'Alicia', 'Witt', 'Deeded', 'Pfeiffer', 'who', 'play', 'daughters', 'Zoey', 'Rachel', 'Cybill', 'show', 'only', 'last', 'four', 'seasons', 'CBS', 'wish', 'could', 'get', 'complete', 'seasons', 'DVD', 'next', 'best', 'was', 'described', 'critics', 'Lucy', 'Ethel', '90', 'really', 'much', 'more', 'best', 'Cybill', 'humorous', 'light', 'what', 'actress', '40', 'struggling', 'maintain', 'career', 'Hollywood', 'still', 'juggling', 'being', 'mother', 'ex-husbands', 'finding', 'romance', 'sharp', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'cast', 'zany', 'characters', 'especially', 'outrageous', 'Christine', 'Baranski', 'more', 'similiar', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'Show']",Cybill: The Volume 1
