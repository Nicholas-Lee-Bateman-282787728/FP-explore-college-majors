Seeing how bad gigs can go seeing how you have to put yourself out there time and time again. Seeing how you make very little money and even lose money just to get on stage and potentially have the audience hate you, oh the joys of comedy. But also you get a look at how comedians develop their material how they draw their jokes from their lives and also how they change their material when the time is right.This movie had me laughing out loud which it on often do (in all actuality I was ROTFLOL because I'm in a wheelchair and any time I laugh out loud I  roll on the floor laughing out loud). The reason I want to say this is because that joke is funny but also a lot of times when I find something funny in a movie I just smile or laugh to myself but this movie actually had me laughing out loud a few times and to me that the mark of something that is truly funny. I would like to note that maybe I we thought it was really funny because I'm a comedian it'll be interesting to see what my friends think.I also like the overall arc of the story has with his message on marriage.

Eventually, in desperation, he starts griping about his stagnant love life during the act and his career picks up steam. Also, he's begun sleepwalking. There's really no connection between those two threads, so they tenuously coexist on lonely parallel paths while the narrator lays it out for us.

1547777,A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3,B0087ITAT4,"K. Corn ""reviewer""","[3, 5]","If the plot of Sleepwalk with Me gives you a sense of deja vu, that could be because you may have heard comic Mike Birbiglia's account of his sleepwalking experiences on public radio. Or perhaps you saw the one man show based on his life. Now Birbiglia- and Ira Glass, host of This American Life- have joined forces to help create and promote Sleepwalk with Me, loosely based on Birbiglia's life.This low budget film could be a sleeper hit of the year. I hope it becomes more than a sleeper and receives major acclaim. It deserves the attention.I recently saw this film (via a pay per view option before the film's official release date) and was totally captivated. I hadn't heard the radio essays by Birbiglia or seen the one man show or even caught any promos for this movie. But I was instantly hooked by the autobiographical tale of a comic afflicted by a sleepwalking problem so severe that he engages in some very wild and bizarre behavior.To say this film is a ""must see"" is an understatement. While fictionalized, the movie is based, however loosely, on Birbiglia's real life and the problems caused by his sleepwalking. But that is only one aspect of his life. There is so much more: his efforts to succeed as a comic, his ambivalent feelings towards his girlfriend ( played wonderfully by Lauren Ambrose), and his complicated relationship with his parents.Birbiglia plays himself in the film, although his name is changed to Matt and real life events are transformed enough that the film is labeled as a fictionalized version of Birbiglia's life. But even if some details aren't an exact match with Birbiglia's experiences, the film still seems absolutely believable and authentic. This is both passion and very real pathos here. There is also drama, danger, and pain.I felt so drawn to Birbiglia and his alter ego Matt, especially  his struggle to build a career while trying to handle the stress of a serious sleep disorder.

The style kept reminding me of Woody Allen movies, back when they were reliable good, but without so much sex-obsession and neurosis.I found the main story about the relationship engaging and poignant. The side stories about comedy and sleepwalking just added that much more. The acting was all good.I like Birbiglia's comedy. The best bit for me in this movie was when he reminds the audience that they are on his side. Loved that.Note that this movie is primarily about relationships and coming-of-age. It's not a comedy in the sense of trying to give you a lot of laughs. Think Annie Hall or Lost in Translation, rather than Some Like it Hot or Raising Arizona.I was actually pleasantly surprised with this movie. I've become a fan of Birbiglia recently - watched a few streaming comedy videos, heard an interview with him on NPR. But I really didn't expect much from this movie - a first-time film by a young comedian, what are the odds that it would actually be very good?Birbiglia's character in this movie, and his comedy persona too, is kind of a mumbling loser. (And could a guy like that make a good movie?) But he is so unassuming and honest about himself that you end up liking him. So that was one of the things I liked about this movie, watching him ""find himself."" Transformation of character is one of the things that makes a story good. Birbiglia is obviously not a slacker in real life, to have directed and created this movie.For people who care about content, there was one F-bomb that I remember, something that a few years ago would have gotten this movie an R. There are also a couple brief seduction scenes, with talk of breasts.The review here titled ""Excellent film full of bittersweet comedy"" said it all in a nutshell.

Oleson,"[0, 0]","Comedian Mike Birbiglia's first movie is an autobiographical story of his life as a struggling stand-up comic and his relationship with his longtime girlfriend Abby (Lauren Ambrose).  Both issues are complicated by a sleep disorder that causes Matt to sleepwalk, sometimes with disastrous results.When Matt (Birbiglia) attends his sister's (Cristin Milioti) wedding, all fingers begin to point at him and when he and Abby will get hitched.  After all, it's been 8 years.  Everybody likes Matt but they love Abby.  Matt bartends hoping to become a stand-up comic, but as more than one person tells him, ""you're not very good.""  And he's not, at least early on.  There's one telling scene in the picture, when asked why he's not sure about marriage and his response is that he's afraid that the best thing about him is Abby.  We get it.As luck would have it, Matt gets a series of one night stands that force him to travel throughout the northeastern United States, alone in a crummy station wagon donated by his critical father (James Rebhorn).  He stumbles and fumbles along the way but eventually finds his rhythm and discovers a new line of jokes.  And they all feature him and his fading relationship with Abby.Fortunately for both, they each discover that they weren't meant for each other, even as they were closing in on a wedding.  The movie is certainly more comedic than dramatic.  It works even if it is sometimes a bit awkward with Matt talking into the camera.  There are several funny scenes involving Matt's sleepwalking.  They are at their best when we get to see what Matt is actually dreaming about.

1547783,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B0087ITAT4,Paul Allaer,"[6, 6]","""Sleepwalk With Me"" (2012 US release; 90 min.) brings the story of Matt (played by Mike Birbiglia) as he struggles with a sleep disorder and tries to salvage his long-time relationship with Abby (played by Lauren Ambrose). Abby wants to get married, badly. Matt, not so much. Abby is looking for any sign from Matt that he will propose, which he eventually does, after an emotional side trip that makes him feel guilty and ashamed. Parallel to all of this, we see Matt getting his start on the stand-up comedy circuit, and barely hnaging on. Then, one day, he makes a funny quip about his failing relationship with Abby, and wouldn't you know, the audience eats it up! I don't want to give more away, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: first and foremost, even though he plays a character called ""Matt"", this story is based on Mike Birbiglia's own life experiences (in fact, before this became a movie, this was an unexpected off-Broadway hit play). Birbiglia not only stars but also co-wrote and co-directed the movie. Second, the movie makes the most of the shoestring budget on which this obviously was made, and I was pleasantly surprised how well it all flowed. Last but not least, the overall tione of the movie is very much bitter-sweet (to me at least). When I saw this in the theatre a few days ago (at the Landmark E Street Cinema in Washington, DC), there were a number of people who were laughing out loud in many parts of the movie. I never felt quite that way. Yes, there are funny moments in it, but when all is said and done, this movie documents a failing relationship and a serious disorder, so how truly laugh-out-loud funny is that?Besides Bribiglia, who obviously carries the movie (and quite well at that), the support cast is nothing short of terrific, including the already mentioned Lauren Ambrose as his girlfriend, but equally if not even more so James Reborn and Carol Kane as his parents. They make the most of the limited screen time they have. This movie is MILES away from your standard Hollywood fare, but if you are in the mood for something quirky and slightly left of center, ""Sleepwalk WIth Me"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",4,Bitter-sweet and funny at the same time,1346976000,"09 7, 2012",2012,2195,"['Sleepwalk', 'Me', '2012', 'US', 'release', '90', 'min', 'story', 'Matt', 'played', 'Mike', 'Birbiglia', 'sleep', 'disorder', 'tries', 'salvage', 'long-time', 'relationship', 'Abby', 'played', 'Lauren', 'Ambrose', 'Abby', 'get', 'married', 'badly', 'Matt', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'Abby', 'looking', 'sign', 'Matt', 'will', 'propose', 'eventually', 'emotional', 'side', 'trip', 'feel', 'guilty', 'ashamed', 'Parallel', 'see', 'Matt', 'getting', 'start', 'stand-up', 'comedy', 'circuit', 'barely', 'hnaging', 'Then', 'one', 'day', 'funny', 'quip', 'failing', 'relationship', 'Abby', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'audience', 'up', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'more', 'away', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'see', 'how', 'out.Several', 'comments', 'first', 'foremost', 'even', 'character', 'called', 'Matt', 'story', 'based', 'Mike', 'Birbiglia', 'own', 'life', 'experiences', 'fact', 'became', 'movie', 'was', 'unexpected', 'off-Broadway', 'hit', 'play', 'Birbiglia', 'not', 'only', 'stars', 'also', 'co-wrote', 'co-directed', 'movie', 'Second', 'movie', 'most', 'shoestring', 'budget', 'obviously', 'was', 'made', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'how', 'well', 'flowed', 'Last', 'not', 'least', 'overall', 'tione', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'bitter-sweet', 'least', 'When', 'saw', 'theatre', 'few', 'days', 'ago', 'Landmark', 'E', 'Street', 'Cinema', 'Washington', 'DC', 'were', 'number', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'many', 'parts', 'movie', 'never', 'felt', 'quite', 'way', 'Yes', 'are', 'funny', 'moments', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'movie', 'documents', 'failing', 'relationship', 'serious', 'disorder', 'how', 'truly', 'laugh-out-loud', 'funny', 'Besides', 'Bribiglia', 'who', 'obviously', 'movie', 'quite', 'well', 'support', 'cast', 'nothing', 'short', 'terrific', 'including', 'already', 'mentioned', 'Lauren', 'Ambrose', 'girlfriend', 'equally', 'not', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'James', 'Reborn', 'Carol', 'Kane', 'parents', 'make', 'most', 'limited', 'screen', 'time', 'have', 'movie', 'MILES', 'away', 'standard', 'Hollywood', 'fare', 'are', 'mood', 'something', 'quirky', 'slightly', 'left', 'center', 'Sleepwalk', 'Me', 'HIGHLY', 'RECOMMENDED']",N/A

He seemed like a funny guy who also happened to be sorta nice too.  I knew nothing about his book, Ira Glass appearances or one-man off-Broadway show.  That's probably a good thing, because I was able to enjoy SLEEPWALK WITH ME pretty much on its own terms.Apparently this movie is quite autobiographical, even though Mike has changed his character's name to Matt.  But Mike/Matt frequently talks directly to the camera, and we're assured the story is true...so it's almost impossible not to assume that we're basically seeing a (perhaps exaggerated) take on Birbiglia's life.  But it doesn't really matter either...the story is compelling and says some interesting things about relationships and about how a stand-up comic builds their career literally from the ground up.Matt is in an 8-year relationship with Abby (Lauren Ambrose, who is wonderful).  Abby is a great girl, and everyone (both viewer and the characters on screen) have to wonder why Matt is having a hard time settling down and committing to a marriage with her.  But as Matt says, he's unhappy that everyone says the best thing about him is his girlfriend.  It's true.  He's a bartender who wants to do stand-up.  Or at least, he thinks he does...he gets almost no opportunities to try.  His life and his relationship is on hold.  Abby is faithful and patient, but also growing frustrated.  Surely she is wondering what more she can give of herself to this man who trembles at the thought of marrying her.One day, with Abby's help, Matt actually gets an agent.  And the agent begins to give Matt tiny gigs.  Gigs that barely cover the cost of gas and food to get there.  But Matt wades in, ready to try out his meager material.  He's actually a pretty terrible comedian, but he's willing to do just about any lousy gig he can get.  He is excited at his new life on the road (there's a great scene when he checks into his first flea-bag motel and is clearly THRILLED).Abby remains in NYC, but is supportive.  Matt continues to limp along until he gets the advice of a more successful peer to use his personal conflicts as fodder for his material.  Suddenly, his material connects with the audience, and his success grows.  He loves life on the road.  And thus, his distance from Abby grows.Meanwhile, he also suffers from severe sleepwalking, where he gets out of bed and runs from the creatures that are chasing him in his dreams.  His dreams of running seem to coincide with this waking fear of commitment.  Of a ""normal"" life chasing him down.Matt frequently behaves poorly, but Birbiglia is so specific in showing us details of his life, that we tend to sympathize with him, even as we wish he would pull himself together.  At one point, before showing us some really poor behavior, Matt turns to the camera and says ""before I show you this next part...remember, you're on my side.""  And he's right, we are.We're also on Abby's side and that's what gives this movie such a rich, bittersweet quality.  We yearn for them to find happiness...yet we see how elusive that is going to be.  Birbiglia directs the film, and he shows an adept touch for little details and telling dialogue.  I'm not ready to say he's a great director, because so far, he's only used his own life as material...but I'd be prepared to see more of his work.SLEEPWALK WITH ME is very funny at times.  It's very raw at times.  It can frequently be surprising (the details of his sleep disorder are fascinating).  It's a very adult film (the language is relatively mild though).  It is VERY well acted (including great support from James Rebhorn and Carol Kane as Matt's parents).  The dialogue is sharp, and few words are wasted.  Almost every line is significant.It's not a perfect film.  Sometimes the pace drags...it felt longer than its 90 minutes.  It occasionally struggles to reconcile its varying tones. I like movies that shift tone, but I like to feel the director MEANT for the tone to shift...sometimes I think it does despite Birbiglia's efforts.  But these are fairly minor complaints and I'd give the film 4.5 stars.",4,Excellent film full of bittersweet comedy,1348617600,"09 26, 2012",2012,4246,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'Mike', 'Birbiglia', 'few', 'stand', 'up', 'broadcasts', 'really', 'knew', 'nothing', 'liked', 'laconic', 'stutter-step', 'approach', 'delivering', 'material', 'seemed', 'funny', 'guy', 'who', 'also', 'happened', 'be', 'sorta', 'nice', 'too', 'knew', 'nothing', 'book', 'Ira', 'Glass', 'one-man', 'off-Broadway', 'show', 'probably', 'good', 'thing', 'was', 'able', 'enjoy', 'SLEEPWALK', 'WITH', 'ME', 'pretty', 'much', 'own', 'terms.Apparently', 'movie', 'quite', 'autobiographical', 'even', 'Mike', 'changed', 'character', 'name', 'Matt', 'Mike/Matt', 'frequently', 'directly', 'camera', ""'re"", 'assured', 'story', 'true', 'almost', 'impossible', 'not', 'assume', ""'re"", 'basically', 'seeing', 'perhaps', 'exaggerated', 'take', 'Birbiglia', 'life', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'story', 'compelling', 'interesting', 'things', 'relationships', 'how', 'stand-up', 'comic', 'builds', 'career', 'literally', 'ground', 'up.Matt', '8-year', 'relationship', 'Abby', 'Lauren', 'Ambrose', 'who', 'wonderful', 'Abby', 'great', 'girl', 'everyone', 'viewer', 'characters', 'screen', 'have', 'wonder', 'why', 'Matt', 'having', 'hard', 'time', 'settling', 'down', 'committing', 'marriage', 'Matt', 'unhappy', 'everyone', 'best', 'thing', 'girlfriend', 'true', 'bartender', 'who', 'do', 'stand-up', 'least', 'almost', 'opportunities', 'try', 'life', 'relationship', 'hold', 'Abby', 'faithful', 'patient', 'also', 'growing', 'frustrated', 'Surely', 'wondering', 'what', 'more', 'can', 'give', 'man', 'who', 'thought', 'marrying', 'her.One', 'day', 'Abby', 'help', 'Matt', 'actually', 'agent', 'agent', 'give', 'Matt', 'tiny', 'gigs', 'Gigs', 'barely', 'cover', 'cost', 'gas', 'food', 'get', 'there', 'Matt', 'wades', 'ready', 'try', 'out', 'meager', 'material', 'actually', 'pretty', 'terrible', 'comedian', 'willing', 'do', 'just', 'lousy', 'gig', 'can', 'get', 'excited', 'new', 'life', 'road', 'great', 'scene', 'when', 'first', 'flea-bag', 'motel', 'clearly', 'THRILLED', '.Abby', 'NYC', 'supportive', 'Matt', 'limp', 'along', 'advice', 'more', 'successful', 'peer', 'use', 'personal', 'conflicts', 'fodder', 'material', 'Suddenly', 'material', 'connects', 'audience', 'success', 'grows', 'life', 'road', 'thus', 'distance', 'Abby', 'grows.Meanwhile', 'also', 'severe', 'sleepwalking', 'where', 'bed', 'creatures', 'are', 'chasing', 'dreams', 'dreams', 'running', 'seem', 'coincide', 'waking', 'fear', 'commitment', 'normal', 'life', 'chasing', 'down.Matt', 'frequently', 'poorly', 'Birbiglia', 'so', 'specific', 'showing', 'details', 'life', 'tend', 'sympathize', 'even', 'wish', 'would', 'pull', 'together', 'one', 'point', 'showing', 'really', 'poor', 'behavior', 'Matt', 'camera', 'show', 'next', 'part', 'remember', ""'re"", 'side', 'right', 'are.We', ""'re"", 'also', 'Abby', 'side', 'what', 'movie', 'rich', 'bittersweet', 'quality', 'yearn', 'find', 'happiness', 'yet', 'see', 'how', 'elusive', 'going', 'be', 'Birbiglia', 'film', 'adept', 'touch', 'little', 'details', 'telling', 'dialogue', ""'m"", 'not', 'ready', 'say', 'great', 'director', 'so', 'far', 'only', 'used', 'own', 'life', 'material', ""'d"", 'be', 'prepared', 'see', 'more', 'work.SLEEPWALK', 'WITH', 'ME', 'very', 'funny', 'times', 'very', 'raw', 'times', 'can', 'frequently', 'be', 'surprising', 'details', 'sleep', 'disorder', 'are', 'fascinating', 'very', 'adult', 'film', 'language', 'relatively', 'mild', 'VERY', 'well', 'acted', 'including', 'great', 'support', 'James', 'Rebhorn', 'Carol', 'Kane', 'Matt', 'parents', 'dialogue', 'sharp', 'few', 'words', 'are', 'wasted', 'line', 'significant.It', 'not', 'perfect', 'film', 'pace', 'felt', 'longer', '90', 'minutes', 'occasionally', 'reconcile', 'varying', 'tones', 'like', 'movies', 'shift', 'tone', 'like', 'feel', 'director', 'MEANT', 'tone', 'shift', 'sometimes', 'think', 'Birbiglia', 'efforts', 'are', 'fairly', 'minor', 'complaints', ""'d"", 'give', 'film', '4.5', 'stars']",N/A
