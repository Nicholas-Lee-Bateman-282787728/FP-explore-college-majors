There are some breath taking chases in the film and Tom Hanks never makes us forget to remember what is at stake. But then again, Mr. Hanks  is a well accomplished actor.

1556336,AGEIT17HENDIS,B008JFUNKU,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 0]","For a while, the last few years anyway, pirates had a pretty good cinematic reputation as a result of Johnny Depp&#8217;s Pirates of the Caribbean series. You know one for all, all for one where even the bad guy pirates were merely misunderstood rather than monstrous barnacles on our homeland, the sea (nice, right). And the good guy pirates, if they would only settle down a little and maybe join a twelve- step program, would be accepted in many a respectable neighborhood as colorful figures sprucing up the leafy suburbs. Going back to childhood even bad guy pirates like Long John Silver in Treasure Island were just irascible figures who needed a couple of breaks. At worst the lot of them were just out to make a little dough doing the best they could by going where the money was on the high seas-the ships. But as the Somalian pirates (and ex-farmers and fishermen) in the high seas drama under review, Captain Phillips, make clear all bets are off as far as that previous characterization of this nasty breed goes- except the money part- they are certainly one with their earlier brethren in seeing booty (no, not that booty) as the sole reason to be in this dangerous occupation.The story-line here, based on the real life incident involving Captain Phillips, is pretty straight forward, pretty much out of today&#8217;s headlines. The Horn of Africa is a key world trade shipping lane which is moreover adjacent to Somalia (and other coastal African countries) where due to political, environmental, and man-made destruction the old ways of life, farming and fishing, have dried up and many young men in need of work find it on the high seas as pirates. That is where the money is. Not so much the question of taking cargoes as the ability to highjack a ship or passengers for ransom. And that is what happens here to the ship that Captain Phillips (played by Tom Hanks) is carefully navigating through the straits.The difference here is, the difference that makes this a dramatic presentation, that Captain Phillips is bound to defend his ship in the old-fashion code of the sea as best he could. Through evasions, through negotiations, and eventually through force (after the pirates and captain wind up on a modern day lifeboat away from the ship) , through the force of the U.S. Navy as it turns out in this situation the pirates are thwarted in their desire to make money. Along the way we get the full range of emotions and ploys by the captain as he tries to save his ship and the &#8220;captain&#8221; pirate (played by Barkhad Abdi) with counter-ploys as he tries to control his increasing restricted environment as well.

Even though the actor does not enjoy the kind of success that he once seemed to have, his choice of roles haven't suffered on account of diminished box office returns, Hanks still makes some great films. Captain Phillips gives Hanks another vehicle to display his great range.In a story based on the 2009 pirate attack  off the Somalian Coast, we get a glimpse of the real Phillips made it and the circumstances that can drive ordinary men to impossible greatness. And the film is all about Hanks- the reluctant hero who must be a leader for his crew and survive at the hands of the pirates, and so incredible is Hanks that you almost forget that he is a superstar. Such is his brilliance that he inspires nothing short of awe when you watch him implode in a scene at the end from all the harrowing days, the unending tension and drama finally taking its toll on an ordinary middle aged man from Vermont, who at the beginning of the world is sharing an observation with his wife about the fast changing world. The film begins as Hanks is being driven to the airport by his wife to a plane that will take him to Africa to his job as the captain of a container ship. As soon as Philips boards the ship it is attacked by a group of Somali outlaws who want to hijack the ship for ransom. They are not armed to the teeth but what makes them dangerous is their bravado and greed. The enemy&#8217;s nature should have been obvious but the director tries to steer us with sympathy about the plight of the pirates and the circumstances under which they became pirates, even hinting that the West could have been indirectly responsible for it.As I said before the amazing part of the film is watching Phillips and the director Greengrass&#8217;s handling of the tale. This film is almost 134 minutes but does not feel lengthy thanks to them.

1556360,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B008JFUNKU,Andrew Ellington,"[60, 79]","I want you to close your eyes (not really, because then you couldn't read this) and imagine something for a moment.  A weathered Bruce Willis sips his coffee while chatting up a group of young, muscle bound actors as they stare out at the open sea.  Just as calm is setting in over the group, Willis sounds the alarms because there are pirates approaching.  Next, we see Will Smith stagger into view as he wields a gun and tries his hardest to win an Oscar by talking with an uneven accent.  He demands money, and lots of it, and next thing you know there is an all-out war as these seaman tear off their shirts, exposing their pulsating chest muscles, and race throughout the ship, taking out pirates left and right.  Willis, who appeared old and weathered on the outset, turns out to be in better shape than he's ever been in his life and the finale centers on a meticulously choreographed fight sequence between him and Will Smith where he spews some one-liners and winds up single handedly rewriting history.I shudder at the thought of what this movie would have turn into, had someone like Michael Bay directed it.Thankfully, we don't really have to think much about that, since Michael Bay did NOT direct this.  Paul Greengrass did, and while Greengrass has had his fair-share of directing action films (those Bourne sequels), he's done so with grit and class, and he's also managed to formulate some really interesting `adult' films (`United 93' still makes a serious impact on me).  He's smart, and he understands that creating tension does not have to revolve around the obvious.`Captain Phillips' snuck up on me.  I was walking into this with some intrigue but little expectation.  The reviews were strong, but I hadn't really read any of them.  I only knew of their status through word of mouth.  My biggest hesitation drew from the fact that Tom Hanks is an actor I just don't get.  He's attained this reputation in the industry as one of the greatest actors to ever live, and yet I've been largely underwhelmed by his career.  I consider his two Oscar wins to be two of the worst in the history of the Oscars, and I just, as a whole, don't find him very compelling.  That isn't to say that I've never liked him, for I have on occasion (his ease and naturalness in `That Thing You Do' was a great moment for him), but overall I just don't care for him.  So, to hear that this is his career best didn't mean much to me; at the time.Now that I've seen the film I have to say that I'm speechless as to the power he brings to EVERY moment of this performance, and those final twenty minutes are some of the best acting I've ever seen put to film, by anyone.The film tells the true story of Richard Phillips, the captain of the MV Maersk Alabama, a US cargo ship sailing to bring supplies to Africa.  While passing through Somalia waters they are hijacked by Somali pirates.  The danger of pirates had become a real thing over the past few months, and it was something that Captain Phillips was aware of and cautious about, but it wasn't anything any of them were really prepared for (it had never happened to an American ship before).  Just when it seemed like they had avoided the worst, one persistent pirate by the name of Muse winds up getting aboard the ship, and from there things take a drastic turn.I have to admit that I was really unaware of a lot of this story.  I remember when it happened, but I don't remember the details and so some of the shifts in this film and the plot details took me by surprise, in a good way.  For over two hours, this film had me trying desperately to breathe.  By the end, I was literally shaking in my seat.  The intensity level of this film is hard for me to describe, but I told my wife when we left (who was sobbing by the end of the film) that I had never felt like that while watching a movie.  It isn't the same feeling of intensity when watching a scary film or an average adventure epic.  There was such brutal honesty to each frame that the heightened empathy felt for Captain Phillips was something I almost couldn't bare up under.  Watching his plight felt almost too real, too authentic.His emotional breakdown (""Can you see this?"") is choking me up right now, just thinking about it.This has already been a great year for film, and `Captain Phillips' is up there at the top.  It fuses genres together with precision yet an ease that makes the whole thing feel genuine, never forced.  The action is there, but the intensity of the film transcends that aspect and really lives and breathes in the moments (and large segments) where the action is non-existent.  The dedicated performances by the entire cast, but more notably by Hanks and Abdi, really bring an earnest authenticity to this film.  I said to my wife when we left the theater that I had NEVER seen fear so honestly depicted on film than while watching Tom Hanks react to the pirate intruders.  Greengrass's decision to keep the American cast from meeting the African actors before filming began was a smart choice, for it added an authenticity you can't fake.Another thing I really appreciated about this film, and something that I think should be noted, is that the treatment of the pirates was very astute.  Muse, while terrifying, has an actual arc (however subtle it may be) and helps create a well-rounded portrayal of the truth.  While their actions are never condoned, you can sense a personal desperation, and when Phillips pleads with visible anger (""You're not just a fisherman!"") you can sense a backstory that holds Muse to his profession and his course of action.  Like he said, he's gone too far now.This has become the biggest surprise of my `film year' so far, and I'm ecstatic at how excellent this film really is.  Technically perfect, with a pitch perfect cast and a resounding finale that will lift your spirits but never in a heavy handed way (such devastating honesty), this is a film you CANNOT MISS!",5,"A

In fact, it was largely the crew efforts that got the pirates off the ship.Captain Phillips efforts were helpful to be sure but one of the most beneficial aspects of his captivity aboard the lifeboat was that he did not move from his initial seated position.  However, many hours/days he was aboard, incredibly he didn't move from his initial position thus making it more likely the special forces wouldn't hit him when they shot the pirates.  So most of the drama aboard the lifeboat was for our entertainment compliments of Hollywood rather than what occurred during the incident itself.Nevertheless, kudos to the captain, crew & the US Navy.for their excellent work denying outlaws any kidnap victims, cargo & the sudden demise of the 3 pirates ought to act as some sort of determent to future like activities.

1556477,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B008JFUNKU,Chris Kennison,"[5, 12]","The story of ""Captain Phillips"" was huge news in 2009 as a large container ship, the MV Maersk Alabama, was boarded by pirates off the coast of Somalia. In an age of rampant terrorism, the story was headline news and was so highly publicized that the President of the United States got involved, along with the Navy Seals. To many, it was shocking news that this sort of thing happens. Pirates? Really? These aren't Jack Sparrow, Captain Hook type pirates, these are desperate, vicious, poor pirates in small boats with nothing to lose. These are pirates who are for the most part, under orders of bigger controlling groups who pray upon the desperate lifestyles of the Somali people.Much has been said about the accuracy of the book written by Captain Phillips,  ""A Captain's Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy Seals, and Dangerous Days at Sea"" and now the movie, ""Captain Phillips"". In fact, many of the crew of the Maersk Alabama are now suing Captain Phillips for wantonly and arrogantly putting them in danger. They are telling stories that completely contradict much of what you see in the film leading up to the pirates boarding their ship. This to me is extremely disappointing if their stories are true. I believe it is irresponsible for movie-makers to misrepresent history. Many people take the easy way out when learning about history and movies leave a huge impression on their minds.That being said, I assume that most of the movie is completely accurate as most of what happened after the pirates boarded is documented by news outlets and the Navy Seals. Director Paul Greengrass handled the true story with a realistic eye. He's made a niche for himself with 7-true story films, the most recognizable of those being ""United 93"". His staging of events is engrossing, vivid and at times tough to watch.""Captain Phillips"" is listed as an action/thriller, but those viewing the film would be quick to mention that this movie shouldn't be lumped in with the typical action movie. I would consider ""Captain Phillips"" more a drama than an action/thriller.  You are side by side Captain Phillips (Tom Hanks) through this realistic and horrible incident with pirates who cannot be accused of being intelligent, but are certainly without a morale code or an alternative to their actions.The movie is tough to watch at times and possibly a little long, but for the most part it is an amazing look inside one of the biggest news stories of 2009. The pirates, although portrayed realistically are infuriating to watch and annoying to watch. From beginning to end they are amazingly fool-minded, disorganized and constantly angrily yelling. I agree that these portrayal's are probably extremely accurate, but as a movie, they are like listening to 10 people yelling different stories at each other for over an hour.""Captain Phillips"" is not for everybody and there's a reason why the creators called this an action/thriller. If they told you what it really was, you probably wouldn't go. ""Captain Phillips"" is not fun to watch and far from thrilling. It is not filled with harrowing and exciting bravery at every corner. It is not filled with twists and turns. It is a dirty, difficult and drudging film that tells the story of real people in a horrible and real situation. If you like that sort of thing, go see it.",4,"at times ANNOYING, TOUGH TO WATCH, PARTLY INACCURATE but still a GOOD film",1381708800,"10 14, 2013",2013,3310,"['story', 'Captain', 'Phillips', 'was', 'huge', 'news', '2009', 'large', 'container', 'ship', 'MV', 'Maersk', 'Alabama', 'was', 'boarded', 'pirates', 'coast', 'Somalia', 'age', 'rampant', 'terrorism', 'story', 'was', 'headline', 'news', 'was', 'so', 'highly', 'publicized', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'got', 'involved', 'Navy', 'Seals', 'many', 'was', 'shocking', 'news', 'sort', 'thing', 'happens', 'Pirates', 'Really', 'are', ""n't"", 'Jack', 'Sparrow', 'Captain', 'Hook', 'type', 'pirates', 'are', 'desperate', 'vicious', 'poor', 'pirates', 'small', 'boats', 'nothing', 'lose', 'are', 'pirates', 'who', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'orders', 'bigger', 'controlling', 'groups', 'who', 'pray', 'desperate', 'lifestyles', 'Somali', 'people.Much', 'been', 'said', 'accuracy', 'book', 'written', 'Captain', 'Phillips', 'Captain', 'Duty', 'Somali', 'Pirates', 'Navy', 'Seals', 'Dangerous', 'Days', 'Sea', 'now', 'movie', 'Captain', 'Phillips', 'fact', 'many', 'crew', 'Maersk', 'Alabama', 'are', 'now', 'suing', 'Captain', 'Phillips', 'wantonly', 'arrogantly', 'putting', 'danger', 'are', 'telling', 'stories', 'completely', 'contradict', 'much', 'what', 'see', 'film', 'leading', 'up', 'pirates', 'boarding', 'ship', 'extremely', 'disappointing', 'stories', 'are', 'true', 'believe', 'irresponsible', 'movie-makers', 'misrepresent', 'history', 'Many', 'people', 'take', 'easy', 'way', 'when', 'learning', 'history', 'movies', 'leave', 'huge', 'impression', 'minds.That', 'being', 'said', 'assume', 'most', 'movie', 'completely', 'accurate', 'most', 'what', 'happened', 'pirates', 'boarded', 'documented', 'news', 'outlets', 'Navy', 'Seals', 'Director', 'Paul', 'Greengrass', 'handled', 'true', 'story', 'realistic', 'eye', 'made', 'niche', '7-true', 'story', 'films', 'most', 'recognizable', 'being', 'United', '93', 'staging', 'events', 'engrossing', 'vivid', 'times', 'tough', 'watch', 'Captain', 'Phillips', 'listed', 'action/thriller', 'viewing', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'quick', 'mention', 'movie', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'lumped', 'typical', 'action', 'movie', 'would', 'consider', 'Captain', 'Phillips', 'more', 'drama', 'action/thriller', 'are', 'side', 'side', 'Captain', 'Phillips', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'realistic', 'horrible', 'incident', 'pirates', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'accused', 'being', 'intelligent', 'are', 'certainly', 'morale', 'code', 'alternative', 'actions.The', 'movie', 'tough', 'watch', 'times', 'possibly', 'little', 'long', 'most', 'part', 'amazing', 'look', 'one', 'biggest', 'news', 'stories', '2009', 'pirates', 'portrayed', 'realistically', 'are', 'infuriating', 'watch', 'annoying', 'watch', 'beginning', 'end', 'are', 'amazingly', 'fool-minded', 'disorganized', 'constantly', 'angrily', 'yelling', 'agree', 'portrayal', 'are', 'probably', 'extremely', 'accurate', 'movie', 'are', 'listening', '10', 'people', 'yelling', 'different', 'stories', 'other', 'hour', 'Captain', 'Phillips', 'not', 'everybody', 'reason', 'why', 'creators', 'called', 'action/thriller', 'told', 'what', 'really', 'was', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'go', 'Captain', 'Phillips', 'not', 'fun', 'watch', 'far', 'thrilling', 'not', 'filled', 'harrowing', 'exciting', 'bravery', 'corner', 'not', 'filled', 'twists', 'turns', 'dirty', 'difficult', 'drudging', 'film', 'story', 'real', 'people', 'horrible', 'real', 'situation', 'like', 'sort', 'thing', 'go', 'see']",N/A

Sawin,"[4, 6]","Unless you're familiar with the actual real life event ""Captain Phillips"" is based on, you can really only judge the action thriller as a film and how much it entertains you rather than how accurate it actually is. As far as captivation goes, ""Captain Phillips"" is absolutely exhilarating at times. The film is a pretty even balance between Phillips, his crew, and preparation for a pirate attack and it even touches on why the Somali pirates do what they do. If they wanted to eat that day, they'd go out, find a ship, and hope its cargo was valuable so their bosses would shower them with reward money. When the two worlds finally collide, it's this really vigorous game of tug of war as you sympathize with Phillips and his crew as they are only trying to protect the load they're transferring along with the lives of those they work with while the group of pirates begins to crumble from within due to their unreasonable greed, stubborn attitudes, and the constant desire to find the mother load that would make them rich.Director Paul Greengrass has become notorious for utilizing what most refer to as the shaky camera technique, however the technique in ""Captain Phillips"" isn't an issue in the slightest and that's coming from someone who can't stand the craze. The camera work in ""Captain Phillips"" almost feels like guerrilla filmmaking as every scene makes the audience feel like they're right along with the crew of the Maersk Alabama being held hostage and fighting for their lives. The perspective that seems like the camera man is capturing the scene with his life on the line while taking cover and the way there's just the right amount of movement to feel authentic without coming off as sloppy causes the film to be mesmerizing from beginning to end.While Phillips' crew mostly all bleeds together, the pirates are significant thanks to their short fuses, extreme tempers, and outrageous attitudes. Nearly everyone in Muse's crew becomes wide-eyed, screams at the top of their lungs, and threatens the lives of several innocent people throughout the course of the film. They easily become memorable thanks to how exaggerated their characters are. Barkhad Abdi is the most extraordinary as Muse as he seems to be the type of man who would rather sit back and see how things play out and yet isn't afraid to get his hands dirty. Muse is a man who's set in his ways and refuses to give in even when the odds are against him and Abdi portrays the character with a kind of grace that makes Muse extremely fascinating to watch. Tom Hanks delivers a masterful performance that has to be the actor's best since ""Road to Perdition."" Captain Richard Phillips is obviously scared out of his mind the majority of the film, but he never stops looking for a way to slow his enemies down. His brain is always ticking away searching for a way to escape. You'll hold your breath and your heart will skip beats in the final 15-20 nerve-racking minutes of ""Captain Phillips."" Hanks' performance is completely disheartening and quite astounding.While the film is mostly very good, there are stretches during its 134-minute duration that drag and feel longer than they probably should. ""Captain Phillips"" is more or less a hostage crisis that spans over two hours, so there's bound to be a little downtime. However, once the pirates turn up it seems as though the formula of the film results to the pirates making absurd demands and Phillips attempting to thwart them before succumbing to whatever they were asking for to begin with. Then it starts all over again while you watch Phillips try to overcome an even stickier situation. Rinse and repeat several times before the big climax. It wasn't necessarily a bad thing. In fact, it was more of a simple premise with a spectacular execution.""Captain Phillips"" is an action thriller filled with intense, chaotic, mayhem, absolute pandemonium, and nefariously determined villains.

Tsao ""Seaview1""","[0, 0]","Based on the real life story and book by Captain Richard Phillips, Captain Phillips is an authentic recreation of the events leading up to the hijacking of an American freighter ship on the high seas by modern day Somali pirates in 2009.  Directed by Paul Greengrass (United 93, The Bourne Ultimatum), the film is a non-stop edge of your seat entertainment that puts you in the midst of a seemingly hopeless situation.  Tom Hanks and a talented supporting cast bring the participants to life in one of the year&#8217;s best films.Phillips is a responsible commander of a freighter with a small crew.  As he boards his ship and readies to embark at sea, a group of Somali men prepares to search for nearby ships to board and hold hostage for money.  As the freighter nears the Somali waters, the pirates give chase and the race is on as Phillips follows a series of procedures to elude and repel the invaders.  When the pirates board and take control of the bridge by force, the dynamic has shifted to a hostage situation. As the Somali, who are smart and cautious, search the ship for other crew members, it becomes a tense game of cat and mouse.  Led by Muse (Barkhad Abdi), the pirates want money even as US military forces come to the rescue.  A tense standoff leads Phillips and his captors to the freighter&#8217;s life boat and a race against time to save the brave captain.Phillips and his crew take creative steps to make this hijacking as difficult as possible.  They even follow a protocol for securing the ship from boarders by running drills and taking extra precautions.  Phillips himself proves resourceful even when alone with his captors by making innocent suggestions that have ulterior motives and meaning.The scene where the pirates take over the bridge is well shot and has a real time feel.  Nobody shoots docudramas better than Greengrass with his rapid edits and handheld cameras.  He conveys a sense of progressively worsening desperation and hopelessness.  Henry Jackman&#8217;s score matches the intensity of the film.Like the concluding mission in Zero Dark Thirty, the final sequence here is meticulously detailed and ratchets the suspense to an unbearable level even though most people know how these events transpired.  The play is the thing, and Greengrass executes the finale like a true, military SEAL operation complete with preparations and tactics.  The climax is a brilliantly edited moment of split second timing, patience, and decisive action. It affects the audience on a visceral level where so much is at riskHanks (Saving Mr. Banks, Philadelphia) is completely convincing as Phillips.  Abdi is authentic and menacing as Muse, all the more impressive since he was a total amateur when cast in the role. You even feel a bit of sympathy for Muse because he comes from a place of poverty where there are few options in life, and you come to realize that he is a person under extreme pressure from his bosses on the mainland.  In fact, utilizing mostly unknowns aside from Hanks, works to the film&#8217;s realism.  The other Somali men are each given a chance to shine and have unique personas which makes what happens to them a shared experience.You also wonder how Phillips&#8217; wife and family are reacting to the crisis but you never see them despite Catherine Keener&#8217;s brief role as his wife at the beginning.

It is riveting, suspenseful, exciting, and very well-made. There are no off moments; no built-in ""bathroom breaks."" Somali pirates capturing an American ship off the Horn of Africa is a timely and fraught topic.The film's verisimilitude is so powerful at times I really did drift into thinking that I was watching a documentary. There's a lot of money up on the screen: cargo vessels, beat-up pirate skiffs, ports, open ocean, Navy warships. Even so it was the performances and the pacing that kept my eyes glued to the screen. I found every last character so well played and gripping, right down to the medic who appears toward the end, that I wondered if Director Paul Greenglass had not hired real corpsmen, or real pirates.Sound is used masterfully. Loud, pulsing music suddenly stops at key moments. Yeah, it's an old trick, but it works especially well here.This is the kind of film I am grateful to have seen in a theater, and I am eager to recommend to friends. Even though action-adventure is not my genre, I'd re-watch this film, and that is high praise.This film is so consistently excellent that one must ask why it doesn't raise to the level of a ten-out-of-ten star film. ""Captain Phillips"" touches on some of the biggest issues of our times: the collision between the First World and the Third World, poverty in Africa, jihad. ""Captain Phillips"" assiduously avoids addressing any of these issues.From this film, viewers would never know that the millions of dollars in ship ransom that pirates claim goes to al-Shabaab, the terrorist group that attacked a mall in Kenya. Muse (Barkhad Abdi) offers rationalizations for piracy: Western nations stole Somalia's fish, and piracy is the ""tax"" for that. Pirates made millions of dollars through piracy. Those millions were not pocketed by the pirates themselves, who work for others. No reference is made to Somalis, in 1993, dragging an American soldier through Mogadishu's streets. Americans were attempting to help Somalis after a famine.Phillips does mention that his ship, waylaid by pirates, was carrying food aid for hungry Africans.None of this is gone into in any detail in the script, and it could have been.Rather, the First World - Third World clash, and the clash of civilizations and religions is communicated solely through images, and, in the absence of a complex script, the images speak very loudly.Somalia is depicted as a dusty, dry, hellhole. Somalis are depicted as chaotic, unproductive, violent, angry, greedy, and lawless. Somalis are dressed in discarded Western clothing and plastic sandals, or simply barefoot. They live in huts. They only things they possess that give them any power is the guns that they got from Westerners. Somalis hold life cheaply and are ready to kill and die.Americans are depicted as orderly, disciplined, skilled, courageous, and productive. Americans devote massive amounts of money to saving one life.When the Somali pirates manage to get their ladder against the Maersk Alabama, the image suggests the pirates as invasive parasites attempting to assault a larger, more successful organism. Whereas the Westerners have built a civilization that creates ships and commerce, the Somalis have created only violence, chaos and greed. They must take guns that they themselves can't manufacture and invade more productive peoples in order to survive. It's an ugly picture, and I can completely understand if Somalis are enraged by this film.Andrew O'Hehir, Salon's film critic, apparently was enraged by the film, and he lambasted it. It was distressing to O'Hehir to watch ""corn-fed, gym-toned"" Americans struggle against ""malnourished"" Africans. That the thin Africans were holding guns to the heads of the Americans did not disturb him. O'Hehir calls the film ""unpleasant and uncomfortable."" He hated watching American military rescue an American hostage. What a sick dude, you want to say. But his view is all too common.I greatly enjoyed this movie. It could have been an all-time classic if the script had offered some insight into the issues the images depicted.",4,Excellent Action Adventure; Why It Is Not a Ten; Clash of Civilizations,1381536000,"10 12, 2013",2013,4138,"['Captain', 'Phillips', 'excellent', 'action-adventure', 'film', 'riveting', 'suspenseful', 'exciting', 'very', 'well-made', 'are', 'moments', 'built-in', 'bathroom', 'breaks', 'Somali', 'capturing', 'American', 'ship', 'Horn', 'Africa', 'timely', 'fraught', 'topic.The', 'film', 'verisimilitude', 'so', 'powerful', 'times', 'really', 'did', 'drift', 'thinking', 'was', 'watching', 'documentary', 'lot', 'money', 'screen', 'cargo', 'vessels', 'beat-up', 'pirate', 'skiffs', 'ports', 'open', 'ocean', 'Navy', 'warships', 'Even', 'was', 'performances', 'pacing', 'kept', 'eyes', 'glued', 'screen', 'found', 'last', 'character', 'so', 'well', 'played', 'gripping', 'right', 'down', 'medic', 'who', 'end', 'wondered', 'Director', 'Paul', 'Greenglass', 'had', 'not', 'hired', 'real', 'corpsmen', 'real', 'pirates.Sound', 'used', 'masterfully', 'Loud', 'pulsing', 'music', 'suddenly', 'key', 'moments', 'Yeah', 'old', 'trick', 'especially', 'well', 'here.This', 'kind', 'film', 'am', 'grateful', 'have', 'seen', 'theater', 'am', 'eager', 'recommend', 'friends', 'Even', 'action-adventure', 'not', 'genre', ""'d"", 're-watch', 'film', 'high', 'praise.This', 'film', 'so', 'consistently', 'excellent', 'one', 'must', 'ask', 'why', ""n't"", 'raise', 'level', 'ten-out-of-ten', 'star', 'film', 'Captain', 'Phillips', 'touches', 'biggest', 'issues', 'times', 'collision', 'First', 'World', 'Third', 'World', 'poverty', 'Africa', 'jihad', 'Captain', 'Phillips', 'assiduously', 'addressing', 'film', 'viewers', 'would', 'never', 'know', 'millions', 'dollars', 'ship', 'ransom', 'claim', 'al-Shabaab', 'terrorist', 'group', 'attacked', 'mall', 'Kenya', 'Muse', 'Barkhad', 'Abdi', 'rationalizations', 'piracy', 'Western', 'nations', 'stole', 'Somalia', 'fish', 'piracy', 'tax', 'Pirates', 'made', 'millions', 'dollars', 'piracy', 'millions', 'were', 'not', 'pocketed', 'pirates', 'who', 'work', 'others', 'reference', 'made', 'Somalis', '1993', 'dragging', 'American', 'soldier', 'Mogadishu', 'streets', 'Americans', 'were', 'attempting', 'help', 'Somalis', 'famine.Phillips', 'mention', 'ship', 'waylaid', 'pirates', 'was', 'carrying', 'food', 'aid', 'hungry', 'Africans.None', 'gone', 'detail', 'script', 'could', 'have', 'First', 'World', 'Third', 'World', 'clash', 'clash', 'civilizations', 'religions', 'communicated', 'solely', 'images', 'absence', 'complex', 'script', 'images', 'speak', 'very', 'loudly.Somalia', 'depicted', 'dusty', 'dry', 'hellhole', 'Somalis', 'are', 'depicted', 'chaotic', 'unproductive', 'violent', 'angry', 'greedy', 'lawless', 'Somalis', 'are', 'dressed', 'discarded', 'Western', 'clothing', 'plastic', 'sandals', 'simply', 'barefoot', 'live', 'huts', 'only', 'things', 'possess', 'give', 'power', 'guns', 'got', 'Westerners', 'Somalis', 'hold', 'life', 'cheaply', 'are', 'ready', 'kill', 'die.Americans', 'are', 'depicted', 'orderly', 'disciplined', 'skilled', 'courageous', 'productive', 'Americans', 'devote', 'massive', 'amounts', 'money', 'saving', 'one', 'Somali', 'manage', 'get', 'ladder', 'Maersk', 'Alabama', 'image', 'pirates', 'invasive', 'parasites', 'attempting', 'assault', 'larger', 'more', 'successful', 'organism', 'Westerners', 'have', 'built', 'civilization', 'ships', 'commerce', 'Somalis', 'have', 'created', 'only', 'violence', 'chaos', 'greed', 'must', 'take', 'guns', 'ca', ""n't"", 'manufacture', 'invade', 'more', 'productive', 'peoples', 'order', 'survive', 'ugly', 'picture', 'can', 'completely', 'understand', 'Somalis', 'are', 'enraged', 'film.Andrew', ""O'Hehir"", 'Salon', 'film', 'critic', 'apparently', 'was', 'enraged', 'film', 'lambasted', 'was', 'distressing', ""O'Hehir"", 'watch', 'corn-fed', 'gym-toned', 'Americans', 'struggle', 'malnourished', 'Africans', 'thin', 'Africans', 'were', 'holding', 'guns', 'heads', 'Americans', 'did', 'not', 'disturb', ""O'Hehir"", 'film', 'unpleasant', 'uncomfortable', 'hated', 'watching', 'American', 'military', 'rescue', 'American', 'hostage', 'What', 'sick', 'dude', 'want', 'say', 'view', 'too', 'common.I', 'greatly', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'all-time', 'classic', 'script', 'had', 'offered', 'insight', 'issues', 'images', 'depicted']",N/A

Wend,"[0, 0]","The hallmark of a great performance is if the actor can convince us that they are not acting at all, and have become the person they are portraying. (some Tom Hanks, as he has many times before, does just that as Captain Philips. He is every bit the captain of the Maersk Alabama, carrying out the mundane but important daily chores of looking after the ship and the welfare of the crew. One has the sense of the responsibilities on his shoulders and the distance he needs to keep from the crew.  Once the ship is boarded by the Somali pirates, we see the professional in his character, protecting the crew and his human side trying to stay clear of harm's way and convince his inexperienced captors that they are in something way over their heads.  The scene when Captain Philips has been captured is riveting and the scene when he has been free, Mr. Hanks remarkably portrays the emotions that the real captain probably felt.  This is a marvelous performance that demands to be seen.The same excellence is true with the actors portraying the pirates, even more remarkable that none of them had any acting experience. Barkhad Abdi is excellent as Muse, the leader of the pirates, as are Barkhad Abdirahman,  Faysal Ahmed and Mahat M. Ali. They are frighteningly unpredictable but also nave and trusting when they should be doubtful.Direct Paul Greengrass does a splendid job telling this true story.  The story is moving and riveting. The scenes where the US Navy and Seals are engaged in freeing Captain Philips are told with military precision itself, with the audience being impressed with the professionalism and determination of our armed forces.

Instinctively he knows how to play the characters he's portraying and dials up the requisite temperament.  Here he is required to be cool and collected as not to upset his machine gun wielding captors.  Fans of action films demand their heroes have a little Arnold Schwarzenegger in them but realistically the approach that Hanks' Captain Richard Phillips takes is the correct one.  This calm veneer belies a man who is emotionally breaking down but for the sake of the crew of his container ship Phillips must maintain the brave face.  Hanks is equaled by his adversary, Muse, played expertly by Barkhad Abdi in his first feature film.  The emaciated Somali pirate is all bravado and jutting bones but unknown to his captives he only engaged in this act of barbarism to appease his tribal elders.  Knowing this you gain a sense of empathy for this ragtag horde of high seas raiders and you sense that Phillips shares this feeling.

But watching the film based on his harrowing ordeal, I felt exactly as Phillips himself must have felt while living through it: When the hell is this damn thing going to end?Don't get me wrong, this is a well crafted, well acted film -- Hanks's last 20 minutes, in particular, are brilliant -- but one that goes on for at least a half-hour too long.  Granted -- unlike Phillips, of course -- I knew how the story would end and I knew that he'd be fine.  Even so, I expected to feel some sense of anxiety and suspense, much as Ben Affleck was able to create in ""Argo,"" another film where the ending was public knowledge.  For some reason, instead of heightening the scariness of it all, Greengrass's ultra-real, ""You Are There"" documentary-style approach, felt flat.  (Particularly in the film's very first scene, which has some of the worst, most artificial dialogue I've ever heard...well, anywhere.)Too many of the scenes are played at an exhausting fever pitch, with everyone yelling and screaming; too many of the set-pieces are drawn-out to a ridiculous length, as if we're watching events in real time.  I get that that's something of the point, and I'm sure it's all very accurate, but I was left numbed and bored.  I seem to be in the minority here -- the film just received 6 Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture --  so I expect most people will be caught up in the drama of ""Captain Phillips.""

Although it's most intently focused on the high-stress elements of the experience, which admittedly make for some gripping, powerful footage, I was most impressed with how even-handedly the film treated the Somali interlopers. While making no excuses for their actions, it successfully conveys an understanding of the pressures and motivations that would drive someone to attempt such a brazen assault and, ultimately, lends sympathy to their plight. Hanks is, predictably, excellent throughout as the stern-for-a-reason captain, though his New England accent seems to drift away with the tide as events unfold. His emotional breakdown near the end of the ordeal is particularly memorable and stirring. Although the plot doesn't cover a lot of ground, Captain Phillips is nonetheless effective at ratcheting up the drama and delivering a charged, uncomfortable, claustrophobic atmosphere.",4,"Harsh, Taxing Suspense with a Racing Pulse and Steady, Level-Headed Convictions",1389916800,"01 17, 2014",2014,1002,"['Tom', 'Hanks', 'helm', 'intense', 'recreation', 'Somalian', 'pirate', 'raid-turned-kidnapping', 'open', 'seas', 'most', 'intently', 'focused', 'high-stress', 'elements', 'experience', 'admittedly', 'make', 'gripping', 'powerful', 'footage', 'was', 'most', 'impressed', 'how', 'even-handedly', 'film', 'treated', 'Somali', 'interlopers', 'making', 'excuses', 'actions', 'successfully', 'understanding', 'pressures', 'motivations', 'would', 'drive', 'someone', 'attempt', 'brazen', 'assault', 'ultimately', 'sympathy', 'plight', 'Hanks', 'predictably', 'excellent', 'stern-for-a-reason', 'captain', 'New', 'England', 'accent', 'drift', 'away', 'tide', 'events', 'unfold', 'emotional', 'breakdown', 'end', 'ordeal', 'particularly', 'memorable', 'stirring', 'plot', ""n't"", 'cover', 'lot', 'ground', 'Captain', 'Phillips', 'nonetheless', 'effective', 'ratcheting', 'up', 'drama', 'delivering', 'charged', 'uncomfortable', 'claustrophobic', 'atmosphere']",N/A

1556586,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B008JFUNKU,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 1]","CAPTAIN PHILLIPS (2013, 135 minutes) is the harrowing true story of Captain Rich Phillips (a stunning performance by Tom Hanks, who lost the Golden Boy to Daniel Day Lewis but then Lincoln is far more interesting than Capt. Phillips and Hanks is Lincoln's 13th cousin once removed), a MAERSK shipping captain whose vessel was besieged by incompetent yet lethal Somali pirates in March of 2009.This film is simple in so many ways--yet it is riveting and Tom Hanks somehow effortlessly, as usual, sinks into his role and it is this fact that established Hanks as our generation's greatest screen presence. In a time when we lost ""our other Tom Hanks"", Philip Seymour Hoffman just as his career got sky-high, it is always a comfort and a joy for me to see Hanks in anything.Here there is nothing overblown or excessive. Hanks' profound gift, a Spencer Tracy-like comfort and ease with anything he does, sets the pace. So Capt. Phillips is like our hero in another of Hanks' masterpiece performances,Cast Away: another day on the job but it will end as anything but another day on the job.The simple fact of the MAERSK Line and the cargo it carries has its own significance: Capt. Phillips late in the film tells the pirates they were shipping food, water and so forth ... for Africans, including for Somalis. Since this is no big-hero, empty-headed shallowfest, it is in a way a real thinker's film.Hanks' portrayal of Phillips is heroic to a fault, yet he is a great captain. Perhaps he is a worrywart, yet that saves his crew's life. His preparedness, which is just what it ought to be, caused the outcome to be victorious. It frustrates me since I have seen the documentary about the event, and it makes Capt. Phillips out to be, well, a hapless victim. Which Capt. Phillips is the real one?If there was any other problem I had it was with the portrayal of the Somali pirates. Since I can't exactly put a finger on that, I can only say we don't really know much about them, so I can't tell if the film was accurate enough. I suspect it was, but I do not ever like trusting any director to teach me anything. Especially anything cultural.You must get this film and drink in the pleasure of a full-on Hanks performance, which I always compare to an important addition to my diet. It is also a rather vital historical document, as fine a picture as it is, because as we all know, Somali pirates continue to plague us and anyone who ventures near them. Best of all, you will instantly feel the overall value, the quality, of this movie.There is at the beginning a sort of homage to CASTAWAY, when Capt. Phillips leaves his Vermont home, setting off for work, and has a long drive with his wife. There they discuss the hardship of his job and there is a loving weariness between them about just how hard it is. Of course, even then, we realize later, Capt. Phillips is thinking about the very real dangers.The cinematography deserves mention: it is of the greatest caliber. Somehow this was shot with the ocean rather than the actors bobbing up and down ... that isn't easy. The film and its action sequences were expertly filmed at every second, and that matters much to me. Instead of getting vertigo, I was even more riveted because of the shooting style. It was steady and straightforward, Old School, and that is THE Good School.Hanks, still relatively young, is also of that School. There are close-ups of him when and as needed, he is that compelling. Anytime a director makes use of the charisma and skill of Hanks through close-ups, you know you have a good director making full use of his best asset. Hanks is perhaps the largest and most fun asset in Hollywood. If you don't know, he blew out the silver screen with his performance as Walt Disney inSaving Mr. Banks(see my review).I tell you: not just any old movie can convey so much so elegantly and clearly. Get this. I have a feeling this will become an all-time perennial classic in the future and we will not be able to live without seeing it repeatedly.FUN FACTS: In my review's title I reference a Spencer Tracy film as a pun (Hanks in my book is second only to Tracy). But it links Hanks to his predecessor: Tracy and Hanks are the only two actors to win best actor Oscars two years in a row.Captains Courageous [VHS] was one of Tracy's Oscar films (the other beingBoys Town); Hanks got two Golden Boys in a row, forPhiladelphiathen forForrest Gump. Oddly, Hanks has also often been chosen as one of the worst actors due to some of his lackluster performances which is something he does not share with Spencer Tracy!",5,"Captain Courageous, or, Tom Hanks 'The Golden Boy' and his next Golden Boy",1393372800,"02 26, 2014",2014,4581,"['CAPTAIN', 'PHILLIPS', '2013', '135', 'minutes', 'harrowing', 'true', 'story', 'Captain', 'Rich', 'Phillips', 'stunning', 'performance', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'who', 'lost', 'Golden', 'Boy', 'Daniel', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'then', 'Lincoln', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'Capt', 'Phillips', 'Hanks', 'Lincoln', '13th', 'cousin', 'once', 'removed', 'MAERSK', 'shipping', 'captain', 'vessel', 'was', 'besieged', 'incompetent', 'yet', 'lethal', 'Somali', 'pirates', 'March', '2009.This', 'film', 'simple', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'yet', 'riveting', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'somehow', 'effortlessly', 'usual', 'sinks', 'role', 'fact', 'established', 'Hanks', 'generation', 'greatest', 'screen', 'presence', 'time', 'when', 'lost', 'other', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'just', 'career', 'got', 'sky-high', 'always', 'comfort', 'joy', 'see', 'Hanks', 'anything.Here', 'nothing', 'overblown', 'excessive', 'Hanks', 'profound', 'gift', 'Spencer', 'Tracy-like', 'comfort', 'ease', 'anything', 'sets', 'pace', 'So', 'Capt', 'Phillips', 'hero', 'Hanks', 'masterpiece', 'performances', 'Cast', 'Away', 'day', 'job', 'will', 'end', 'anything', 'day', 'job.The', 'simple', 'fact', 'MAERSK', 'Line', 'cargo', 'own', 'significance', 'Capt', 'Phillips', 'late', 'film', 'pirates', 'were', 'shipping', 'food', 'water', 'so', 'forth', 'Africans', 'including', 'Somalis', 'big-hero', 'empty-headed', 'shallowfest', 'way', 'real', 'thinker', 'film.Hanks', 'portrayal', 'Phillips', 'heroic', 'fault', 'great', 'captain', 'Perhaps', 'worrywart', 'crew', 'life', 'preparedness', 'just', 'what', 'ought', 'be', 'caused', 'outcome', 'be', 'victorious', 'have', 'seen', 'documentary', 'event', 'Capt', 'out', 'be', 'well', 'hapless', 'victim', 'Which', 'Capt', 'Phillips', 'real', 'one', 'was', 'other', 'problem', 'had', 'was', 'portrayal', 'Somali', 'pirates', 'ca', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'put', 'finger', 'can', 'only', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'much', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'film', 'was', 'accurate', 'enough', 'suspect', 'was', 'do', 'not', 'ever', 'trusting', 'director', 'teach', 'anything', 'Especially', 'anything', 'cultural.You', 'must', 'get', 'film', 'drink', 'pleasure', 'full-on', 'Hanks', 'performance', 'always', 'compare', 'important', 'addition', 'diet', 'also', 'rather', 'vital', 'historical', 'document', 'fine', 'picture', 'know', 'Somali', 'continue', 'plague', 'anyone', 'who', 'ventures', 'Best', 'will', 'instantly', 'feel', 'overall', 'value', 'quality', 'movie.There', 'beginning', 'sort', 'homage', 'CASTAWAY', 'when', 'Capt', 'Phillips', 'Vermont', 'home', 'setting', 'off', 'work', 'long', 'drive', 'wife', 'discuss', 'hardship', 'job', 'loving', 'weariness', 'about', 'just', 'how', 'hard', 'course', 'even', 'then', 'realize', 'later', 'Capt', 'Phillips', 'thinking', 'very', 'real', 'dangers.The', 'cinematography', 'mention', 'greatest', 'caliber', 'Somehow', 'was', 'shot', 'ocean', 'rather', 'actors', 'bobbing', 'up', 'down', ""n't"", 'easy', 'film', 'action', 'sequences', 'were', 'expertly', 'filmed', 'second', 'matters', 'much', 'Instead', 'getting', 'vertigo', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'riveted', 'shooting', 'style', 'was', 'steady', 'straightforward', 'Old', 'School', 'Good', 'School.Hanks', 'still', 'relatively', 'young', 'also', 'School', 'are', 'close-ups', 'when', 'needed', 'compelling', 'Anytime', 'director', 'use', 'charisma', 'skill', 'Hanks', 'close-ups', 'know', 'have', 'good', 'director', 'making', 'full', 'use', 'best', 'asset', 'Hanks', 'perhaps', 'largest', 'most', 'fun', 'asset', 'Hollywood', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'blew', 'out', 'silver', 'screen', 'performance', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'inSaving', 'Mr.', 'Banks', 'see', 'review', '.I', 'tell', 'not', 'just', 'old', 'movie', 'can', 'convey', 'so', 'much', 'so', 'elegantly', 'clearly', 'Get', 'have', 'feeling', 'will', 'become', 'all-time', 'perennial', 'classic', 'future', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'live', 'seeing', 'repeatedly.FUN', 'FACTS', 'review', 'title', 'reference', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'film', 'pun', 'Hanks', 'book', 'second', 'only', 'Tracy', 'Hanks', 'predecessor', 'Tracy', 'Hanks', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'actors', 'win', 'best', 'actor', 'Oscars', 'two', 'years', 'row.Captains', 'Courageous', '[', 'VHS', ']', 'was', 'one', 'Tracy', 'Oscar', 'films', 'other', 'beingBoys', 'Town', 'Hanks', 'got', 'two', 'Golden', 'Boys', 'row', 'forPhiladelphiathen', 'forForrest', 'Gump', 'Oddly', 'Hanks', 'also', 'often', 'been', 'chosen', 'one', 'worst', 'actors', 'due', 'lackluster', 'performances', 'something', 'not', 'share', 'Spencer', 'Tracy']",N/A

Then there's Phillips. Hanks is a seasoned professional and it shows here. One of his final scenes is so powerful it, alone, is worth the price of admission. He's a by the books guy. He's not overly strict with his men but he's not their buddy either. He expects them to do as he asks. He's also clever. He pulls a couple of tricks that help him and his men in this difficult situation. Then there's Greengrass. This is no slick Hollywood outing. There is a lot of hand held camera and natural light which helps draw the viewer into the action. You feel as though you are there with them. And it's not overwrought.

1556598,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,B008JFUNKU,Erik North,"[2, 5]","It's not likely that anyone anticipated the possibility of high-seas piracy coming back into style in the post-9/11 world.  But that's what befell the crew of the American cargo ship ""Maersk Alabama"" in April 2009, when four Somali pirates took over their vessel, resulting in a three-day ordeal in which the captain of the ship, Richard Phillips, was held hostage for a $10 million ransom.  That ransom was never paid; and a team of Navy Seals managed to end the crisis by killing the four pirates, who had been holding Phillips hostage in an escape boat less than two hundred miles from the Somali coast.  Phillips and his crew, however, all survived the horrific ordeal, shaken but alive.  This is the true story told in CAPTAIN PHILLIPS, the 2013 docudrama about perhaps the best-known instance of high seas terrorism in our present context.Effectively directed by Paul Greengrass, whose penchant for docudrama was perhaps best established in the much-lauded, and intense, 2006 9/11 film UNITED 93, CAPTAIN PHILLIPS stars Tom Hanks in the title role, of the captain who, aware that armed Somali pirates were present in the waters of the Indiana Ocean some six hundred miles east of Somalia, urges his crew to keep a lookout for any skiffs that seem to contain armed men.  One such group, led by Barkhad Abdi, approaches them; but through some skillful maneuvers, they manage to evade them.  The next day, however, the ""Maersk Alabama"" isn't so lucky.  Armed with automatic weaponry and with a better knowledge of American cargo ship tactics, Abdi and his four companions board the ship and hold Hanks and a few others hostage (this while Hanks has managed to get the rest of his crew below deck and out of sight).  When one of the hijackers gets his foot badly injured by broken glass, Hanks urges them to get help, and leaves with them in the ship's escape boat.  The pirates believe that Hanks is willing to be a hostage in an act of self-sacrifice; but all along, his crew on the ""Maersk Alabama"" are tailing him and his captors; and the decision is made from Washington to end the crisis by the use of the Navy's elite Seal Team Six (the same one that would, in 2011, track down and kill Osama Bin-Laden).  It all comes down to a fierce confrontation within a hundred miles of the Somali coastline.Greengrass' great specialty is in bringing back the idea of documentary-style realism to the cinema, which had proven to be highly successful in his own 2002 opus BLOODY SUNDAY (which was based on the 1972 crackdown of the Irish Republican Army by the British).  In UNITED 93, he told in very stark terms the terrifying saga of the one plane hijacked on 9/11 that didn't reach its intended target because the passengers of that flight fought back against their Al-Qaeda captors.  That same sense of realism infuses CAPTAIN PHILLIPS, with Greengrass and his director of photography Barry Ackroyd doing things largely in the same documentary, almost cinema verite, style that had worked for BLOODY SUNDAY and UNITED 93, resulting in a film that, even if it doesn't surpass UNITED 93, comes very close to it.  But just as much of the success of CAPTAIN PHILLIPS is owed to the incredible Everyman performance of Hanks in the title role.  His ability to do the Everyman role, exemplified in his portrayal of astronaut Jim Lovell in the 1995 Ron Howard classic APOLLO 13, works out quite well for him; and Abdi makes for a particularly great adversary.  There is a real sense of Greengrass, as he had done on UNITED 93 (as well as Hanks on APOLLO 13) of not wanting to do everything in CAPTAIN PHILLIPS as your typical Hollywood action blockbuster, and the end result, along with an intense score by Henry Jackman (which also interpolates the climactic cue of John Powell's score for UNITED 93) being the icing on this cake, is a tremendous piece.Indeed, it is on my list of the best movies released in 2013.",5,"""They're Not Here To Fish""",1382313600,"10 21, 2013",2013,3909,"['not', 'likely', 'anyone', 'anticipated', 'possibility', 'high-seas', 'piracy', 'coming', 'back', 'style', 'post-9/11', 'world', 'what', 'befell', 'crew', 'American', 'cargo', 'ship', 'Maersk', 'Alabama', 'April', '2009', 'when', 'four', 'Somali', 'pirates', 'took', 'over', 'vessel', 'resulting', 'three-day', 'ordeal', 'captain', 'ship', 'Richard', 'Phillips', 'was', 'held', 'hostage', '10', 'million', 'ransom', 'ransom', 'was', 'never', 'paid', 'team', 'Navy', 'Seals', 'managed', 'end', 'crisis', 'killing', 'four', 'pirates', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'holding', 'Phillips', 'hostage', 'escape', 'boat', 'less', 'two', 'hundred', 'miles', 'Somali', 'coast', 'Phillips', 'crew', 'however', 'survived', 'horrific', 'ordeal', 'shaken', 'alive', 'true', 'story', 'told', 'CAPTAIN', 'PHILLIPS', '2013', 'docudrama', 'perhaps', 'best-known', 'instance', 'high', 'seas', 'terrorism', 'present', 'context.Effectively', 'directed', 'Paul', 'Greengrass', 'penchant', 'docudrama', 'was', 'perhaps', 'best', 'established', 'much-lauded', 'intense', '2006', '9/11', 'film', 'UNITED', '93', 'CAPTAIN', 'PHILLIPS', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'title', 'role', 'captain', 'who', 'aware', 'armed', 'Somali', 'pirates', 'were', 'present', 'waters', 'Indiana', 'Ocean', 'six', 'hundred', 'miles', 'east', 'Somalia', 'crew', 'keep', 'lookout', 'skiffs', 'seem', 'contain', 'armed', 'men', 'One', 'such', 'group', 'led', 'Barkhad', 'Abdi', 'skillful', 'maneuvers', 'manage', 'evade', 'next', 'day', 'however', 'Maersk', 'Alabama', ""n't"", 'so', 'lucky', 'Armed', 'automatic', 'weaponry', 'better', 'knowledge', 'American', 'cargo', 'ship', 'tactics', 'Abdi', 'four', 'companions', 'board', 'ship', 'hold', 'Hanks', 'few', 'others', 'hostage', 'while', 'Hanks', 'managed', 'get', 'rest', 'crew', 'deck', 'sight', 'When', 'one', 'hijackers', 'foot', 'badly', 'injured', 'broken', 'glass', 'Hanks', 'get', 'help', 'ship', 'escape', 'boat', 'pirates', 'believe', 'Hanks', 'willing', 'be', 'hostage', 'act', 'self-sacrifice', 'along', 'crew', 'Maersk', 'Alabama', 'are', 'tailing', 'captors', 'decision', 'made', 'Washington', 'end', 'crisis', 'use', 'Navy', 'elite', 'Seal', 'Team', 'Six', 'same', 'one', 'would', '2011', 'track', 'down', 'kill', 'Osama', 'Bin-Laden', 'down', 'fierce', 'confrontation', 'hundred', 'miles', 'Somali', 'coastline.Greengrass', 'great', 'specialty', 'bringing', 'back', 'idea', 'documentary-style', 'realism', 'cinema', 'had', 'proven', 'be', 'highly', 'successful', 'own', '2002', 'BLOODY', 'SUNDAY', 'was', 'based', '1972', 'crackdown', 'Irish', 'Republican', 'Army', 'British', 'UNITED', '93', 'told', 'very', 'stark', 'terms', 'terrifying', 'saga', 'one', 'plane', 'hijacked', '9/11', 'did', ""n't"", 'reach', 'intended', 'target', 'passengers', 'flight', 'fought', 'back', 'Al-Qaeda', 'captors', 'same', 'sense', 'realism', 'infuses', 'CAPTAIN', 'PHILLIPS', 'Greengrass', 'director', 'photography', 'Barry', 'Ackroyd', 'doing', 'things', 'largely', 'same', 'documentary', 'almost', 'cinema', 'verite', 'style', 'had', 'worked', 'BLOODY', 'SUNDAY', 'UNITED', '93', 'resulting', 'film', 'even', ""n't"", 'surpass', 'UNITED', '93', 'very', 'close', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'success', 'CAPTAIN', 'PHILLIPS', 'owed', 'incredible', 'Everyman', 'performance', 'Hanks', 'title', 'role', 'ability', 'do', 'Everyman', 'role', 'exemplified', 'portrayal', 'astronaut', 'Jim', 'Lovell', '1995', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'classic', 'APOLLO', '13', 'out', 'quite', 'well', 'Abdi', 'particularly', 'great', 'adversary', 'real', 'sense', 'Greengrass', 'had', 'done', 'UNITED', '93', 'as', 'well', 'Hanks', 'APOLLO', '13', 'not', 'wanting', 'do', 'everything', 'CAPTAIN', 'PHILLIPS', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'action', 'blockbuster', 'end', 'result', 'intense', 'score', 'Henry', 'Jackman', 'also', 'climactic', 'cue', 'John', 'Powell', 'score', 'UNITED', '93', 'being', 'icing', 'cake', 'tremendous', 'piece.Indeed', 'list', 'best', 'movies', 'released', '2013']",N/A

However, it's not as though his acting ability has diminished in his 12 year drought - just his acting frequency.  Within the last ten years, his roles have been sporadic at best and shockingly mediocre at times - especially in films like The Ladykillers, Larry Crowne, and Angels & Demons.  Although his acting career may seem less important, it's not as though he's left the entertainment business - he's simply taken on different roles in the entertainment business, such as play actor and executive producer.  But, fear not Tom Hanks fans - it would appear his lack of Academy recognition will be coming to an end with the upcoming award season as Hanks should have no problem earning a lead actor nomination for his portrayal as Captain Richard Phillips in Captain Phillips.Based on a true story and directed by Paul Greengrass (United 93, The Bourne Ultimatum), Captain Phillips stars Tom Hanks as Richard Phillips, Captain of the United States transport ship, Maersk Alabama.  On the way to Africa, the Maersk Alabama is approached and eventually hijacked by a crew of Somali pirates, led by their own Captain - named Muse (Barkhad Abdi).  However, once aboard the ship, the Somalis are unable to operate the vessel, forcing them to abandon their plan and head home - but not before they take a hostage with them.  Tensions run high as the U.S. Navy is called in to defuse the situation, either by freeing Captain Phillips or stopping the Somalis by any means necessary.

Ali, & Yul Vazquez also star in supporting roles.If you're unaware of the actual events of the Maersk Alabama hijacking in April 2009, you're encouraged to keep it that way, at least until after you see this movie.  Obviously, like any means of entertainment, if you know how something is going to turn out, the build-up isn't as exciting.  With that being said, I'll happily admit that the real life events of this story had somehow escaped my memory, so I had no idea how this film was going to end.  For better or worse, the high amount of tension involved with this film's plot literally had me biting my finger nails for nearly the entirety of the film.  Much like last year's critically acclaimed film, Argo, Captain Phillips progresses in a similar manner, depicting an emotionally taxing historical event.  The progression of the story is fueled by copious amounts of emotional stress, and focuses on lead characters that you can't help but become emotionally attached to.  And, while Argo was brilliant in its own right, Captain Phillips is a much more personal tale, which also happens to deal with hostages being taken during a rather unique scenario.While Captain Phillips is a masterfully written story (scripted by Billy Ray), Tom Hanks is the real attraction of this film.  Not since Forrest Gump has Tom Hanks been this awe-inspiring, bringing a screen presence that is all-domineering in every facet of the film.  Unquestionably, Hanks radiates in his portrayal of this brave, selfless hero that puts his crew above and beyond his own safety - qualities that anyone and everyone can admire.  While Hanks' career is already defined by so many quality roles, this portrayal of Captain Phillips is easily one of his top five portrayals, rivaling any of his previous roles (other than Forrest Gump - which will easily go down as his greatest role of all-time).  In any event, if you're a Tom Hanks fan (and I don't know many people that aren't), this film will re-cement him on your list of the best actors in the world today.The most shocking aspect of this film is the fact that the Somali pirates, portrayed by Barkhad Abdi, Barkhad Abdirahman, Faysal Ahmed, and Mahat M. Ali, have never acted in a feature film prior to Captain Phillips.  The best part about it is that if I wouldn't have just told you that particular tidbit, you would have never noticed.  In fact, you'll likely assume these guys are all well-established in the industry - only you've just never seen them before.  It's obviously a major gamble from the casting department, but it's a gamble that couldn't have gone any better and pays off in dividends.  While each of the pirates play a significant role in this film, Barkhad Abdi plays a much more important role than his three counterparts, portraying Captain Phillips's main rival.  Even though Tom Hanks owns nearly every scene of this film, his character is only as strong as the main villain, a role that Abdi pulls off brilliantly.  It wouldn't be a surprise in the least to hear a substantial amount of award buzz surround Abdi for depiction of the pirate known as Muse.The beauty of a film like Captain Phillips is that it's an all-encompassing film hat quickly reaches out and snatches your attention to the point that you'll forget that you're even watching a movie.  From the pirate's first attempt to take the ship, all the way until the final scenes of the film - each and every passing moment is just as vital and important as the last, causing you to become emotionally invested in the outcome of Captain Phillips and his crew.  And, even since the successful elimination of Osama bin Laden, featured prominently in Zero Dark Thirty, there has been a great deal of interest in previous Seal Team Six missions, one of which was defusing the tense situation while Captain Phillips was in captivity.  Naturally, the incorporation of the seals also adds to the general interest of a story the one might simply chalk up to being a random pirate encounter.Overall, there's no doubt that Captain Phillips is the best film of 2013 - at least up to this point (and it will be nearly impossible to overtake).  The level of passion and sentiment emanating from this film is the reason many of us (including myself) go to the movies.  This film provides an escape from reality as a means to witness one of the more stressful, thrilling, and eventually heart-warming events - not just in real life, but also on the big screen.  Tom Hanks brings the character of Richard Phillips to the forefront, and with good reason.  At a time when he was in need, this film also sheds light on the often unaccounted heroic actions of the United States military and the lengths they will go to protect its citizens.  To be honest, there's too many aspects of this film to praise in one short review, but the bottom line is this thrilling drama screams (to the rafters) Academy Award winner - for several individual (writing, screenplay) and group efforts (cinematography, production design), including Best Motion Picture.  In other words, go see this movie.  Go now!GRADE: AFNDNreview.com",5,'Captain Phillips' is the best film of 2013,1381363200,"10 10, 2013",2013,6852,"['surprise', 'many', 'Tom', 'Hanks', ""n't"", 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', '1995',

It was a true shame when the warlords moved in and ruined the country. But it broke your heart to see people on the edge of starvation, when a goat's milk and blood was the only thing between living and dying! Enter the piracy and ransom methodology. Watching a film in which an egoed captain put his crew at risk to save the company a few bucks, while ignoring numerous piracy warnings and then seeking notoriety on top of it by writing a book is too much to take! This hijacking/kidnapping attained such notoriety because it was the first US-flagged ship attacked in a hundred years. Everybody had to get in on the act! I could find no data on the cost of this rescue, but it surely went into the multimillions of dollars to the US taxpayer, with at least three Navy cruisers and an aircraft carrier involved; with a jump-in by US Navy seal snipers. All this could have been avoided if international maritime law were changed for 'unarmed' craft, allowing minimum arms in the Somali 600-mile attack corridor! Two security men per ship, with grenade and rocket launchers and .50 cal machine guns would surely wave off any attack. This reminds me of the US Space program, in which NASA spent 9 million dollars developing a ballpoint pen that would write in space! The Russians merely used pencils. The US has always been involved in overkill and inefficient use of resources, with tremendous cost to the US taxpayer. Why Captain Phillips was revered is difficult to comprehend...it was his crew who captured the Somali leader. And they are now suing him for risking their lives! The film itself is relatively boring...how exciting can a container ship be? Once the attack takes place it is just screaming and gun threats...not much acting there!

Of course, much of that is due to the impeccable direction by Paul Greengrass (The Bourne series, United 93, Green Zone, etc), but the kudos land directly for the extraordinary performance by Tom Hanks, in what many of us believe is his finest performance on film, along with `Philadelphia'.Because it is history, everyone knows the story: a multi-layered examination of the 2009 hijacking of the U.S. container ship Maersk Alabama by a crew of Somali pirates. The film focuses on the relationship between the Alabama's commanding officer, Captain Richard Phillips (Hanks), and the Somali pirate captain, Muse (Barkhad Abdi), who takes him hostage. Phillips and Muse are set on a predestined collision course when Muse and his crew target Phillips' unarmed ship. In the breathtaking standoff, 145 miles off the Somali coast, both men find themselves at the mercy of forces beyond their control.Greengrass had the right idea in casting completely unknown non-actors as the Somali pirate crew: Barkhad Abdi (born in Somalia but living in the US and serving as a chauffeur when he was cast with no acting experience at all), Barkhad Abdirahman, Faysal Ahmed, and Mahat M. Ali - each is wholly credible in the tense drama both on the big ship and in the claustrophobic life boat where they hold Captain Phillips hostage. The entire cast is very well enacted, keeping the tension and the sense of terror at facing a battle for which they have never been trained.This is a superb piece of filmmaking and why it was snubbed by the Oscar nominations is a conundrum.

And it does. Kind of.OK. Seriously, though. First, be aware that this film may be a whitewash of the real Captain Phillips; his crew says they in fact warned him repeatedly about entering pirated waters, but he ignored them. And so on. I don't know whom to believe, but just FYI.Second, the good Captain does things which don't make sense. He ignores the warning of his crew that the first encounter will be followed-up, and they should haul, er, butt. He says if they do, they'll run into other pirates anyway. This decision allows the pirates to catch up. Then, after telling the crew to hide and under no circumstances be captured to be held hostage, he stays on the bridge and ... is held hostage.Third, he is constantly saying things to his captors which would probably irritate them rather than calm them down. Look for these nuggets. I cringed each time.Otherwise, this film is suspenseful, not exactly action-packed, but thrilling nevertheless. This is due in no small part to the actors who play the wild-eyed pirates, looking scary as all get-out. You see how they're recruited into a ruthless, greedy pirate ring, constantly demanding and yelling and threatening. You feel a bit sorry for them.They say they're forced into this life because of big fishing boats which get all their fish. I don't know if this is true or not. But they apparently use this as their excuse for violence and theft.You get to see how comedically useless the ""non-lethal"" defenses of a big ship are against pirates - they blithely weave in between water jets and shoot open pirate cages.And we sympathize with the crew, who complain that they are unarmed against dangerous thugs. We can pontificate all day about how un-nice it is to have armed security on ships, but I guarantee the day you spot a skiff of armed criminals on course with your ship, you'll be wishing you had a bazooka - certainly after watching this team of khat-addled goons.You'll see the full force of the US Navy swing into action to rescue this one man. And you'll make no mistake - these are the good guys. And consummate professionals, carrying out what seems a convoluted plan (what's that with making big wakes, stopping the tow, etc.?).There is more waiting than I had expected. There is Jason Bourne Jerky-Cam in the lifeboat, which might make you seasick. Nothing actually happens a lot of the time there, just some threatening and panicking. The Captain's interactions with the pirates there seem somewhat random and without any real plan, except to apparently antagonize them more.There is a semi-happy ending, as the pirate team lead, Muse, makes his way to the United States.I enjoyed it, but it's not a five-star movie to me.

With Paul Greengrass (""United 93"" and the ""Bourne"" franchise) at the helm, we know we are in for a PG-13, white-knuckle ride. We see the US-flagged MV Maersk Alabama container-ship taken by pirates off the coast of Somalia in 2009, the first such hijacking in two hundred years.The script by Billy Ray (""The Hunger Games"") is based on (Captain) Richard Phillips book, ""A Captain's Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy SEALS, and Dangerous Days at Sea"" which depicts these events from his personal experience.Although we are already familiar with the situation from 2009 news accounts, we see the wildly contrasting lives of our principals: the high-tech environment enjoyed by modern maritime workers, as opposed to the starkly marginal survival of the Somalis who are assigned the task to ""Go get us some money!"" I was fascinated by the ubiquity of khat, the mildly addictive African narcotic used in Muslim countries because alcohol is forbidden. Chewing these leaves dulls the appetite, which makes life there more endurable.We have:* Tom Hanks (""Cloud Atlas"") as our eponymous (and resourceful) hero, a fellow who insists he is anything BUT a hero. He says, ""You just do what you have to do."" ...but he does PLENTY, in extremely trying circumstances!* Barkhad Abdi in his first film role, plays Muse (""Moo say'""), the Somali captain of a primitive pirate boat, desperate and wily. His ultimate goal is to ""go to America.""* Faysal Ahmed is Najee, a big, gun-waving Somali who becomes increasingly frenzied as the full might and power of the United States military (WITH Navy SEALS!) surrounds their tiny lifeboat.There were many wonderful characters but I won't devote any more space to them. Instead, I urge you to see the film and tell me if you agree that the last ten minutes will earn Mr. Hanks another Oscar. Our screening audience applauded and you will applaud your DVD from Amazon.Kudos for the sound, photography, art direction, set design, script, and acting.

Hanks chooses his roles carefully, and brings all of his accumulated skill and talent to fully realizing the role he accepts. As Captain of a container ship plying the waters of the Indian Ocean, he commands the ship with a firm but fair hand. Though the crew is small, he admonishes them to secure the ship before they even leave port, and runs a safety drill once they are underway.When they spot their pursuers, he immediately takes evasive action, but  due to a flaw in one of the water hoses that spout water at high pressure to fend off the pirates, the ragtag band of 4 Somali pirates are able to board the vessel and break into the bridge. In order to spare his crew from the violent unstable pirates, Phillips bravely agrees to leave the ship with the pirates in the life boat. He remains calm and even gives them advice, which of course they spurn. He shows compassion for the pirates, even offering to clean and wrap the wounded foot of the youngest Somali.There are numerous very intense scenes where the pirates, particularly their captain, erupt into screaming matches and threaten to kill Phillips, but somehow his calm demeanor overcomes their anger. The final scenes, when the Navy SEALS arrive and dispatch the pirates, are brutal and emotional and Captain Phillips' reaction is truly stunning.I hoped for a conclusion from this episode, such as improved security on ships in the area, or a reduction in instances of piracy, but after Phillips was freed from the pirates, the movie just ended.

Richard Phillips is given the task of taking command of a ship by the name MV Maersk Alabama. And as he aboards the ship things are running ever so smoothly. However, after taking notice of two not-so-familiar boats that are approaching the ship, our Captain finds himself at the very center of a hostage crisis, and from there, we have our movie.I should start by saying that I did do some research going into the movie; and although there have been reports that this movie itself is not entirely accurate, I loved Captain Phillips. Tom Hanks has had numerous good/great performances; THIS IS one of his greats. From beginning to end, he personifies the role of the Captain turned hostage very well. And though Barkhad Abdi is relatively an unknown actor, he was equally as great in his role as Abduwali Muse. Great acting.The situation on screen is almost unbearable; many times during the movie I was holding my breath because of the intensity of the scenes and the savagery of the Somalian pirates. They are not clever, but they have guns, and their leader Abduwali has a motive.If you have not yet seen Captain Phillips, I urge everyone to give this movie a watch.

1556777,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B008JFUNKU,J. Richardson,"[0, 0]","Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.Whenever I watch a film like Captain Phillips, my immediate reaction is always, &#8220;That actually happened?!?&#8221; When dealing with the world of fiction, the audience can easily accept any scenario without question because, in the back of their mind, everyone knows the events are not real. When dealing with non-fiction, however, this mindset changes drastically. Now we are watching a story based on a living, breathing human being and, depending on the narrative, this realization could be unsettling, which is the perfect word to describe Captain Phillips: unsettling. The film is raw and unforgiving in its execution, and the ending is as beautiful as it is emotional.Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks) is a ship captain who is in charge of the MV Maersk Alabama, a cargo ship loaded with food and supplies. His destination is the poverty-stricken city of Mombasa, which he and his crew will reach by traveling through the Horn of Africa. Unfortunately, this part of the sea is littered with pirates, mainly from Somalia, so the risk is high for everyone on board. The fear of being taken over by pirates soon becomes a reality as Phillips and crew fight off approaching pirate boats. However, because the ship is unarmed, one of the boats manages to commandeer the ship, and Phillips must fight for his life and the safety of his crew.Surprisingly, the narrative in Captain Phillips is extremely dense, which is why the film wastes no time throwing the viewer into the action. Within moments of meeting Phillips, the captain finds himself on the ship, meeting the crew, and setting sail. I wasn&#8217;t expecting things to move at such a rapid pace, but the further I got into the movie, the more it became apparent as to why the film starts the way it does. Although it may not have been advertised as such, this is a complex story that relies on heavy emotion almost as much as it does on high intensity, so in order to receive the appropriate reaction, they needed as much detail as possible in all the right places.For the most part, the film succeeds in accomplishing this task, which is shocking given the fact the story follows Phillips, his crew, and the Somalians. With the exception of the crew, the audience builds up a certain emotional connection with Phillips through the events that transpire, and the same can be said about the Somalians, to a certain extent. These pirates aren&#8217;t acting out for personal gain per se; they are acting out because their country is struggling. As the film progresses, Phillips begins to truly understand this, and he tries to use this to his advantage through persuasion. Although I personally would have liked to see more from the crew, I understand why they were excluded due to the film&#8217;s current running time.Another minor complaint of mine comes through the use, or lack thereof, of forced subtitles. After doing some light research, I&#8217;m under the impression that the forced subtitles were present in the theatrical release, but this is never made clear to those who watch the film on DVD/Blu-Ray. Apparently there are subtitles for the Somali language, but they have to be activated in the &#8220;Settings&#8221; menu. As a result, my family went through the entire movie ignorant as to what the Somalian pirates were saying, and it became a bit taxing because they make up a good 50% of the dialogue. I will say, though, that it allowed me to better sympathize with Phillips because he too had no idea what was going on. Their language is foreign and incomprehensible, and this only makes the situation all the more frightening. So it was kind of a win/lose situation, but it is something everyone should be made aware of.My biggest complaint, however, is in regards to the obnoxious shaky cam that is arguably Captain Phillips' biggest downfall. Paul Greengrass' work on the Bourne films suffered from the same issue, but those were at least a little understandable due to the constant action. The shaky cam in Captain Phillips, on the other hand, is just the result of bad camera work. There are never any demanding fight sequences, there aren&#8217;t any crazy firefights, and there is no real reason why this should even be a problem. Majority of the film consists of Phillips and company having conversations, walking across the ship, or sitting down. That&#8217;s it. I just about lost it when the shot switched to a silent, still Abduwali Muse (Barkhad Abdi), and the camera was swaying all over the place.Although the shaky cam did manage to take me out of the experience on occasion, the performances always managed to pull me right back in. Considering this was his first film, Barkhad Abdi was a blast to watch on screen. His heavy accent made Abduwali all the more menacing, and his facial expressions displayed someone who was truly conflicted with the severity of the situation. Another surprise standout was Michael Chernus, who plays first officer Shane Murphy. He was always an attention grabber in the scenes he was in, and I would have liked to see more of him. The real accomplishment, though, came from Tom Hanks, who seems to outdo himself time and time again. His performance left me speechless as I fought back tears during the film&#8217;s final moments, and this will probably go down as one of his best performances.Overall Score: 8.8/10 - Is Captain Phillips perfect? No, but there is no denying the film&#8217;s excellence. The film manages to immerse its audience with ease, and the performances across the board were fantastic. Unfortunately, the story&#8217;s density made it impossible for the writers to include all the details that would have truly left me satisfied, like the impact these events had on the crew, and the film&#8217;s shaky cam never ceased to be a huge annoyance. Taking that into consideration, Captain Phillips succeeds more than it fails, and that&#8217;s all that matters. Those looking for a balls-to-the-wall action flick should look elsewhere, but if you want something that will truly stick with you, look no further.",4,8.8/10 - Hanks dominates,1395187200,"03 19,

If not let me tell you alittle bit about the event that started on April 8th 2009 and ended four long days later on April 12th. Four Somali Pirates attacked the Maersk Alabama cargo ship on route toward Mombasa, Kenya and after a struggle they got on board with the intentions of taking over the ship and sailing it to Somalia. However the crew fought back and the pirates were forced to leave the ship on a lifeboat, with the captain as a hostage. After 3 days on the lifeboat, the U.S military were able to safely rescue Phillips from the pirates. I had previously herd about this on the news. It was fascinating, and I knew at once it had potential to be film adapted. And here we are, October 2013. Captain Phillip and his crew's story of heroism and survival have been painted onto the big screen. The film went onto be nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards. It didn't win, but I can see why it got nominated. It's a great film, and I'll tell you why. My review of 'Captain Phillips'.'Captain Phillips' tells the true story of the crew of the Maersk Alabama cargo ship of which was on route toward Mombasa, Kenya when a group of four Somali Pirates hijacked the ship. But when the crew fought back, the four Somalians were forced to hold the Captain (Played by Tom Hanks) hostage on a life boat.Ok, so I may have just spoiled the whole film for you. But odds are you have already read in the paper the story of the Maersk Alabama cargo ship hijacking and already knew what was going to happen. Anyways, the story is told in a pretty solid fashion. The cast which includes real simalians (Smart casting decision) powerfully convey the emotions and energy that the real crew and pirates were probably having at the time of the incident. 'Tom Hanks' leads the cast as the Captain. With Hanks, you used to be able to tell that if he's in the film, it's going to be good, but lately with disaster 'Larry Crowne' and pile of migraines 'Cloud Atlas' you can't tell anymore. But rest easy, maybe Hanks is getting back to his old self. He acts with ease, sending the audience the heartbreaking emotions of his predicament. His acting leads the film, and you want him to make it, to continue to fight back and get on. He played perfectly the average man, ho when thrusted into a problem acts as any average man would act. Not all John McClain sudden action hero. His last 5 minutes of screentime are the most emotional minutes the entire film has, all because of his performance. 'Barkhad Abdi' is the scene stealer though as the leader of the hijacking pirates. He is smart, leadership worthy, and pitiful. He isn't the worst guy; he just wants money and will do anything for it. He isn't crazy or just plain kill-hungry. He just wants money. He stole all the scenes he had, and I wish he'd been given a better chance at the Academy Awards.What makes 'Captain Phillips' a success is its direction from 'Paul Greengrass'. Greengrass successively captures the true story on camera with skill. His camera work is impressive and smart, bringing you into the action, seeing things the way Phillips and other's see things. It's really worthwhile to watch. He gives us a few nice shots of the boats as well as a view of Somalia. Oh, and we can't forget those neat shots of the lifeboat from the U.S military's point of view... that was pretty neat.A problem here is the jagged editing. The pace doesn't help anything either. The film runs to fast into its action and the editing doesn't keep up, jolting us back and forth with quick glances at Hanks and then to Abdi and it makes your eyes kind of roll right into your head. The editing and pacing make it hard for you to concentrate on the emotional center the cast is trying to convey. It's too fast and jittery for you to be able to grab anything to hold onto. It ends in a blur, a big blue blur. You try your best to keep steady but in the end it tips you over. Not to say it ruined the film, just made it harder to fully engulf yourself into when you have to concentrate on everything to make sure you processed it. If you will, relate the pacing to a speeding motor boat, and relate the editing to the hard waves you hit when your fast boat hits the waves. That's what you feel watching this. However points go to it as well, for keeping you on the edge of your seat.The music gives a very dynamic performance as well. Even if the film isn't as holding as it should be, the music tries to catch the viewer and hold them as long as it can. It is original, it is moving, it is almost as quick and loud as the film itself is, and it holds you. It gets you to the edge of your seat. It's like a beating and as soon as someone moves it grows loud jumping out at you, to waken you, get you more invested in what is about to go down. In the end it's a clever score, with a few nice bits of music that work well with the scene's going on.The script is very smart as well. The script writer, 'Billy Ray', adapts the true story in very good fashion. While I'll admit, he does add to the story to more fully cinematize the story for the big screen. But, gratefully enough it doesn't do anything to alter the story too much, but instead showcases the heroics of the crew and Captain. It's the true American tale and it's told quite well. There seem to be no inaccuracies here, it looks to me that 'Billy Ray' took some time to research the ship and such to make the film as accurate as possible, and I have to pat him on the back for his work. The script deserved the nod at the Academy Awards for best screenplay. It's a solid and smart script and beyond tense, even if it isn't as emotionally driven as it could've and should've been.Making use of its solid 50 million budge, the film sports great production values, what with the ships and scenery and waves, it's all put to the best use to make this tale as accurate in portrayal as it is on paper. 'Paul Greengrass' knew what he wanted to do with the true tale, and succeeds in using what he had to faithfully adapt the story for the screen.All and all, 'Captain Phillips' is a solidly acted, tense, and smartly scripted film from the great 'Paul Greengrass' but I must express my sadness at the film not having been as emotionally connected as it should have been. B+ 3/27/14P.S: Next up for 'Tom Hanks' was playing another real life hero... just not in the same fashion as Walt Disney in 'Saving Mr. Banks'. I have yet to see the film, but from Hank's performance here, I can hopefully rest at ease that Disney won't go to shame with his onscreen portrayal.",4,"Tense, powerfully acted, and strongly

The cinematography by Barry Ackroyd is brilliant. The film editing by Christopher Rouse (who also co-produced) is brilliant. The casting by Francine Maisler is brilliant.

In his discussions of SEAL training and what they can do, he told of this daring rescue of Captain Phillips, played by Tom Hanks. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, was because it kind of went on too long in the scene where Phillips and the pirates were in the life boat. It lasted forever. Otherwise, it would be a 5 star rated movie. I think you'll enjoy it. After watching this, it did leave me with one big question. Why in the world are these ships unarmed when they know they will be entering pirate infested areas? It must be due to civilian ships traveling in international waters.

His portrayal of the captain of the American cargo ship The Alabama, highjacked by Somali pirates, is outstanding. Better still, Barkhad Abdi, an unknown inexperienced Somali who plays his qat-fuelled neurotic nemesis, Muse, is truly brilliant - the perfect foil to Hanks' polish. Both of them are worthy of their respective award nominations. A stellar cast, all round, made credible under Paul Greengrass' expert direction.Tension builds at a steady pace, setting the scene for what is to come. Having successfully boarded the ship, the pirates take Phillips hostage in a lifeboat.

Writer Billy Ray (Hunger Games, Flight Plan) did an amazing adaption of the book written by Richard Phillips and Stephen Talty and made the sea adventure extremely feel real, intense and packed with emotion.Tom Hanks (Forrest Gump, Philadelphia) does a tour-de-force performance (again), especially at the end, of a ship's Captain who makes quick and rational decisions in the forbodding  inevitable face of real deadly danger that is approaching his ship. Based on a real happening, the story is a simple one, but how it unfolds is dramatic, energetic and quite often `hold-your-breadth' thrilling. Peaking at an emotional climax at the end where you'll be relieved and overwhelmed with the outcome of the entire adventure.This is a truly adventurous thrill ride of fear and anticipation. Tom Hanks is just amazing to watch and completely real in his convictions for his character. From his basic love of his wife played by Catherine Keener (40 Year Old Virgin, Into The Wild) as he leaves his home to take his ship, to the calming `take control of the situation' attitude when the threat of looming boats, just two miles from the ship, are getting closer, to the intense direction and misdirection toward the pirate crew who actually board his ship to take control of it.The real adventure occurs when Hanks is tricked off his own boat onto the lifeboat and taken as a hostage with thirty thousand dollars from the ships safe. There are moments of anguish, fear and competition amongst the pirates and it's when the US Navy and Navy Seals are brought in to defuse the situation that your heart doesn't stop pounding.Basically it's about a band of pirates want to take over a barge and sell its cargo and hold hostage its crew, all done miles off the coast of Africa. Hanks is the captain of the boat and with a minimal crew he learns how to survive with only his experience, wits and a desire to live for his wife as his tools.With this being their first motion picture credit, Barkhad Abdi playing the Pirate Captain,  Barkhad  Abdirahman playing the wildly crazy eyed `first mate' and the young teenager Mahat M. Ali do an incredible job of playing a rogue band of pirates trying to steal a 30 million dollar barge filled with cargo and food.

Power ""nlp trainer""","[4, 6]","About four years ago an American freight ship was hijacked off the coast of Somalia, and pirates attempted to extort a ridiculous ransom. Ultimately the US government directed a rescue mission involving Navy seals, recovered the ship, and killed the pirates.Except that is not exactly what happened, and we now have a gripping movie telling the true story of what happened to Captain Phillips.Tom Hanks excels as the Captain, dealing with these sometimes hysterical, often irrational pirates who make unrealistic demands for money, and persist in their demands to the point of folly, with the only weapons at his disposal, his wits.If any pirate should dare to watch this movie, they will learn a very cautionary tale about messing with American ships in International waters, and more importantly messing with the military might of the American government.If you're like me you may be surprised at the level and style of defense of the freighter given the prevalence of piracy incidents around Somalia, that enabled a large freighter ship to be taken over by only four pirates, and unusual measures the ship took. How four pirates were able to actually to get this ship is a wonder to behold.There is no Captain Jack Sparrow, no peg legs, no pieces of eight, or bottles of rum in this movie. What we have instead is the gritty reality of piracy, and pirates, and the sense that human life has no value to them.What I like about Captain Phillips the character is that he is in his element, and in control of his ship. The pirates are never able to get control, because the crew is dispersed and hidden, and without arms yet able to resourcefully counter the pirates attempts.  Tom Hanks gives another nomination worthy performance.Captain Phillips is not so much a struggle between pirates and sailors but between entirely different ways of life, and systems. When Captain Phillips offer them the $30,000 in the ships safe, one wonders why they did not take that, and call it a good days work. But no, one can see how their choices pave the way to tragedy, greed being the fatal propeller.I found this movie to be much better than I anticipated, and I loved the acting of the pirate Muse, the gaunt leader of the pirates, whose very gauntness appears menacing.One strange response I had to the movie was that about two third of the way through the movie when the action moves to a lifeboat, I began to feel queasy, not understanding why. I realized I was getting from watching all the heaving motion on a forty foot screen, filmed with somewhat jerky hand held cameras.I put my hands over my eyes for several minutes, stealing the occasional peek when I could, until the feeling passed. I imagine you will not experience the same problem watching on a large screen tv as in a theater, but if you decided to watch this while still in release, bring some dramamine or cover your eyes if necessary.So, my takeaway from this movie is that it's not about the motion of the ocean or the size of the ship, it's about the size of the navy you have supporting you, and it's about your own personal resourcefulness in dealing with danger. An interesting fact is that the leader of the pirates asked to be tried as a juvenile, claiming he was 15 or 16 at the time.  He later admitted to being 18.I understand that the shipping company's was sued by some members of the crew claiming the company and Phillips recklessly and knowingly ignored piracy reports, and allowed the ship to sail in pirate infested waters.I think you will enjoy, as it is quite gripping.

I didn't know of the events before watching the film, that added to my enjoyment.I got the feeling that Tom Hanks was playing Tom Hanks rather than Captain Phillips, in much the same way that he did in Cast Away, but I'm not concerned about that and I may be wrong anyway. Barkhad Abdi both looked the part and played the part very well.Paul Greengrass' style is not to everyone's tastes but I liked the way that tension was built and then converted into action. I heard Messrs Hanks and Greengrass interviewed about the stresses deliberately created when shooting the scene of the pirates breaking into the bridge; I was looking forward to seeing that scene and I wasn't disappointed. That for me was a great example of the effectiveness of Greengrass' style. The mind games in the lifeboat were well shot too.I had a strong feeling of inevitability (in a good way that added to the tension) at many stages in this film and not knowing the story accentuated that. Knowing that this was based on actual events prevented me from considering the movie to be all 'a bit too Hollywood'.Inevitability and loss of control were keenest for me at a number of stages: The captain had no effective means to deny boarding; the double cross to get the captain into the lifeboat; the deployment of the SEALs; the deterioration of the 'negotiations' as the pirate leader lost control through lack of ability.It was good to see some balance in the storytelling. This was not just 'Team America, World Police'. I might have preferred a little more time devoted to the background of the Somalis' situation but perhaps that would have painted them too much as victims. In the end, everybody lied at some stage.I liked the line &#34;We all have bosses.;..&#34; and its context; also, the captain's reply to the leader's statement about the how his previous hijacking led to a payment of $6million.The final 10 or 15 minutes were compelling and the final 3 or 4 minutes simply brilliant, I challenge anyone to remain unemotional as they are played out.An interesting homily about one's chances of successfully negotiating with Special Forces whilst holding hostages - but then one shouldn't hijack and abduct in the first place.",5,Entertaining and well made,1394668800,"03 13, 2014",2014,2269,"['very', 'enjoyable', 'well', 'made', 'film', 'highly', 'recommend', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'events', 'watching', 'film', 'added', 'enjoyment.I', 'got', 'feeling', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'was', 'playing', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'rather', 'Captain', 'Phillips', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'did', 'Cast', 'Away', ""'m"", 'not', 'concerned', 'may', 'be', 'wrong', 'anyway', 'Barkhad', 'Abdi', 'looked', 'part', 'played', 'part', 'very', 'well.Paul', 'Greengrass', 'style', 'not', 'everyone', 'tastes', 'liked', 'way', 'tension', 'was', 'built', 'then', 'converted', 'action', 'heard', 'Messrs', 'Hanks', 'Greengrass', 'interviewed', 'stresses', 'deliberately', 'created', 'when', 'shooting', 'scene', 'pirates', 'breaking', 'bridge', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'scene', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'was', 'great', 'example', 'effectiveness', 'Greengrass', 'style', 'mind', 'games', 'lifeboat', 'were', 'well', 'shot', 'too.I', 'had', 'strong', 'feeling', 'inevitability', 'good', 'way', 'added', 'tension', 'many', 'stages', 'film', 'not', 'knowing', 'story', 'accentuated', 'Knowing', 'was', 'based', 'actual', 'events', 'prevented', 'considering', 'movie', 'be', 'bit', 'too', ""Hollywood'.Inevitability"", 'loss', 'control', 'were', 'keenest', 'number', 'stages', 'captain', 'had', 'effective', 'deny', 'boarding', 'double', 'cross', 'get', 'captain', 'lifeboat', 'deployment', 'SEALs', 'deterioration', ""'negotiations"", 'pirate', 'leader', 'lost', 'control', 'lack', 'ability.It', 'was', 'good', 'see', 'balance', 'storytelling', 'was', 'not', 'just', ""'Team"", 'America', 'World', 'Police', 'might', 'have', 'preferred', 'little', 'more', 'time', 'devoted', 'background', 'Somalis', 'situation', 'perhaps', 'would', 'have', 'painted', 'too', 'much', 'victims', 'end', 'everybody', 'lied', 'stage.I', 'liked', 'line', '34', 'have', 'bosses', '..', '34', 'context', 'also', 'captain', 'reply', 'leader', 'statement', 'how', 'previous', 'hijacking', 'led', 'payment', '6million.The', 'final', '10', '15', 'minutes', 'were', 'compelling', 'final', '3', '4', 'minutes', 'simply', 'brilliant', 'challenge', 'anyone', 'remain', 'unemotional', 'are', 'played', 'interesting', 'homily', 'one', 'chances', 'successfully', 'negotiating', 'Special', 'Forces', 'whilst', 'holding', 'hostages', 'then', 'one', 'should', ""n't"", 'hijack', 'abduct', 'first', 'place']",N/A

It makes sense:  both deal with American encounters with Somalis and Somalia and both are superb, nail-bitingly intense stories that will keep viewers on the edge of their seats.The story centers around Captain Richard Phillips (played by Tom Hanks in a performance that I bet gets him an Academy Award or at least a nomination for one).  The real-life Phillips was the master of the cargo ship Maersk Alabama, which was hijacked in 2009 by Somali pirates.  Phillips found himself adrift in a lifeboat with the pirates heading for Somalia until the US Navy decisively intervened.Besides Tom Hanks' standout performance as Phillips, the movie has multiple strong points:1.  The realism is very strong.  I found the sequence of scenes where the pirates chased and boarded the ship to be particularly convincing (it seems a real ship was used for much of it and if there were any CGI effects they were seamlessly integrated into the mix).  The stand-off on the high seas between the pirates and the Navy was another strong point (given the apparent participation of the US Navy in making the film).2.  The movie made the Somali pirates three-dimensional human beings instead of cardboard villains, but it didn't go overboard by even slightly attempting to excuse their despicable behavior.  The Somali actors playing them did a great job portraying desperate men who were willing to commit murder and terrorize people who had done nothing wrong to them for money.&lt;spoilers>3.  The movie also deserves praise for its depiction of how Phillips reacted to his ordeal.  Up until the point where the pirates were shot dead, he had shown a great deal of composure and cool-headed thinking.  But in the immediate aftermath of his rescue, guess what?  He went into shock.  How many times have we seen movies where the hero or heroine undergoes some sort of horrific ordeal and displays no evidence of that in its aftermath? Hank's showing Phillips having an emotional and physiological collapse after being held at gunpoint, threatened, abducted, and brutally beaten over a prolonged period, made the movie viscerally ""real"" to me.The film is not perfect.  I thought the first couple of minutes where Phillips drove to the airport from his home in the US with his wife was pretty dull, and given the fact that they didn't show any scenes with his wife or family after that, it was pretty pointless.  Another criticism I would have would be that the film didn't explain why after the first attempt by the pirates to hijack the ship was reported, there was no real response to the authorities.  But those are minor criticisms.  Bottom line:  this is a terrific movie.  I plan to see it again in the theaters, and I know I will be adding it to my DVD library.&lt;end spoilers>Here are some books I'd suggest looking into reading to get a better understanding of Somalia and piracy.The Pirates of Somalia: Inside Their Hidden WorldPirate State: Inside Somalia's Terrorism at SeaThe World's Most Dangerous Place: Inside the Outlaw State of Somalia",5,Terrifying Story of Modern Day Piracy,1381449600,"10 11, 2013",2013,3143,"['year', 'two', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'see', 'Captain', 'Phillips', 'bundled', 'together', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'sense', 'deal', 'American', 'encounters', 'Somalis', 'Somalia', 'are', 'superb', 'nail-bitingly', 'intense', 'stories', 'will', 'keep', 'viewers', 'edge', 'seats.The', 'story', 'centers', 'Captain', 'Richard', 'Phillips', 'played', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'performance', 'bet', 'Academy', 'Award', 'least', 'nomination', 'one', 'real-life', 'Phillips', 'was', 'master', 'cargo', 'ship', 'Maersk', 'Alabama', 'was', 'hijacked', '2009', 'Somali', 'pirates', 'Phillips', 'found', 'adrift', 'lifeboat', 'pirates', 'heading', 'Somalia', 'US', 'Navy', 'decisively', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'standout', 'performance', 'Phillips', 'movie', 'multiple', 'strong', 'points:1', 'realism', 'very', 'strong', 'found', 'sequence', 'scenes', 'where', 'pirates', 'chased', 'boarded', 'ship', 'be', 'particularly', 'convincing', 'real', 'ship', 'was', 'used', 'much', 'were', 'CGI', 'effects', 'were', 'seamlessly', 'integrated', 'mix', 'stand-off', 'high', 'seas', 'pirates', 'Navy', 'was', 'strong', 'point', 'given', 'apparent', 'participation', 'US', 'Navy', 'making', 'film', '.2', 'movie', 'made', 'Somali', 'three-dimensional', 'human', 'beings', 'instead', 'cardboard', 'villains', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'overboard', 'even', 'slightly', 'attempting', 'excuse', 'despicable', 'behavior', 'Somali', 'actors', 'playing', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'portraying', 'desperate', 'men', 'who', 'were', 'willing', 'commit', 'murder', 'terrorize', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'done', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'money.', 'lt', 'spoilers', '>', '3', 'movie', 'also', 'praise', 'depiction', 'how', 'Phillips', 'reacted', 'ordeal', 'point', 'where', 'pirates', 'were', 'shot', 'dead', 'had', 'shown', 'great', 'deal', 'composure', 'cool-headed', 'thinking', 'immediate', 'aftermath', 'rescue', 'guess', 'what', 'went', 'shock', 'How', 'many', 'times', 'have', 'seen', 'movies', 'where', 'hero', 'heroine', 'undergoes', 'sort', 'horrific', 'ordeal', 'evidence', 'aftermath', 'Hank', 'showing', 'Phillips', 'having', 'emotional', 'physiological', 'collapse', 'being', 'held', 'gunpoint', 'threatened', 'abducted', 'brutally', 'beaten', 'over', 'prolonged', 'period', 'made', 'movie', 'viscerally', 'real', 'me.The', 'film', 'not', 'perfect', 'thought', 'first', 'couple', 'minutes', 'where', 'Phillips', 'drove', 'airport', 'home', 'US', 'wife', 'was', 'pretty', 'dull', 'given', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'scenes', 'wife', 'family', 'was', 'pretty', 'pointless', 'criticism', 'would', 'have', 'would', 'be', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'explain', 'why', 'first', 'attempt', 'pirates', 'hijack', 'ship', 'was', 'reported', 'was', 'real', 'response', 'authorities', 'are', 'minor', 'criticisms', 'Bottom', 'line', 'terrific', 'movie', 'plan', 'see', 'again', 'theaters', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'adding', 'DVD', 'library.', 'lt', 'end', 'spoilers', '>', 'Here', 'are', 'books', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'looking', 'reading', 'get', 'better', 'understanding', 'Somalia', 'piracy.The', 'Pirates', 'Somalia', 'Inside', 'Their', 'Hidden', 'WorldPirate', 'State', 'Inside', 'Somalia', 'Terrorism', 'SeaThe', 'World', 'Most', 'Dangerous', 'Place', 'Outlaw', 'State', 'Somalia']",N/A

1556895,A33AB9A2RVBGHG,B008JFUNKU,MegaPrimeBleach,"[0, 0]","Captain Philips is based on a true event which occurred in the year 2009. Richard Phillips, played by Tom Hanks, had to manage the Maersk Alabama, a ship with a crew of 20, loaded with 17,000 metric tons of cargo which was bound for Mombosa, Kenya departing about the end of March. After a week or two of traveling the Maersk is attacked by a Somolian pirate group of four all around the ages of 16-20. The pirates take Captain Phillips to one of the ship&#8217;s life boats and endeavor on bringing him to Somolia for ransom.Pros:This movie is intense and nerve-wracking. At one scene, the Captain realizes the radar indicates two small boats so he alerts everyone in the ship to do their procedure. Just the tension of everyone preparing as time runs out is nail biting. The possible upcoming situation is chilling. Even when the pirates are attempting to attach a ladder to the ship, one of the crew members activates some hydraulic system of hoses that shoot out high-pressurized water, which are all around the boat for defense. The pirates end up on the boat of course. There is plenty more parts that leave one on the edge of their seat.The acting is phenomenal, and truly brings the characters too life. Tom Hanks does a fantastic job on emphasizing anxiety and stress in his face, so well done you would think he is really feeling this way. The Somolian leader Abduwali Muse, played by American Somolian actor Barkhad Abdi, was committed to make money even if it meant kidnapping, and had no thoughts on turning back. An example of his determination was when at one point Phillips asked him &#8220;Isn&#8217;t there anything else for you to do instead of kidnapping people?&#8221; Muse replies &#8220;Maybe in America, but not where I come from&#8221;. Also while Captain Phillips had plans and ways of crippling the pirates, Muse was ahead of the game. The acting shows struggle, and anxiety amazingly and even makes one who watches this feel it as well. To make the viewer feel this is a great achievement.The camera angles tend to move frequently to go with the movements of the characters or stress of their voice. The shots were done right, and instead of ruining the experience it enhanced it, strangely giving a sense of realism. The movements of the cameras are almost hypnotic and give the viewer a perception of being in the actual situation.To sum up this short review, it is nearly inconceivable to discover any faults in this movie. It is well worth the time and effort of watching. The fact that this was a true event also increases this movie&#8217;s eminence. Captain Phillip&#8217;s earns a 10/10, a real masterpiece.

Most of the movie feels like a discovery channel ""build it bigger"" episode the way the director shows the outside/inside/inner workings of the ship throughout the movie.  There's so much photography of the ship that I was thinking the studio should market a Captain Philips Maersk Alabama model ship or something like that.As for the story, its basically a retelling of the events of the Somali pirate hijacking a few years ago.  At the time the movie was released there was talk of how the crew was displeased with the movie/book and that the captain was not quite as sympathetic as portrayed by Tom Hanks.  I can understand their point of view; sometimes I felt like his character was overdoing it with the understanding and compassionate approach he had towards the pirates.  At other times, when the pirates are riding their motor boats towards to ship it felt like I was watching the Waterworld stunt show at Universal.Nonetheless the movie draws you in as your watching, as you see the pirates overtake the ship and began a fierce search for crew members throughout the ship.  There's many shots of intense conversation between the pirates and Hanks, while the vastness of the ocean is shown in the background.This is not the most intense or exciting movie, but doable for a Saturday night.

1556916,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B008JFUNKU,M. Oleson,"[2, 2]","Theatrical review.  There may be spoilers.Director Paul Greengrass rarely disappoints, whether it's with his two ""Bourne"" movies or with the OMG ""United 93.""  Because the film is based on real events, the film has feel of dramatic accuracy, similar to ""United 93.""  And like that film, this one has a mix of veteran actors and an effective group of newbies.Tom Hanks is the veteran actor who really counts.  He has another memorable performance as Phillips, the captain of a U. S. flagged freighter.  He and his crew are caught off the Somali coast and, after some heroic efforts, are ultimately boarded by a handful of armed pirates.  Most filmmakers would likely have eschewed any back story of how those pirates got to a profession of taking cargo and crew as hostages, but Greengrass and screenwriter Billy Ray take the time to see how fishermen become criminals.  It doesn't make what they do any more acceptable, but does give us an understanding.Greengrass keeps the audience wrapped up tight as the pirates search the ship for the hiding crew.  Only Phillips and 2 crewmen from the bridge are being held.  Phillips is calm and does his best to keep his crew safe.  Tension mounts as the Somalis led by Muse (remarkable Barkhad Abdi) take Phillips and $30K (from the safe) into the ocean inside a capsule-like lifeboat.  The U. S. Navy intercepts the lifeboat, refusing to allow it to enter the Somalian mainland.The standoff ratchets up again, especially after the S.E.A.L. team is called in.  With the crew snacking on what I assume are coco leaves, they become more and more agitated.  Especially Najee (Faysal Ahmed) who would scare the hell out of anyone in his high-as-a-kite condition, waving around a .45 semi-automatic pistol.  Greengrass doesn't give the audience a lot of time to celebrate Phillips ultimate extraction either.  This is where Hanks will likely draw some Oscar votes.  In a state of shock that seems authentic to me, Phillips has to be coaxed to breathe by the ship's corpsman.  Hell, I felt like she was bringing me out of the same state.  This is a brilliant piece of filmmaking.  One of the year's best.BLU RAY UPDATE (6-3-14):This second viewing of this remarkable film, allowed me to look a bit closer at some of the technical aspects of the film.  I was immediately struck by the editing (Christopher Rouse).  Let's face it, the middle part of an action based drama can be a bit of a challenge to keep interesting.  Much of that middle slog is overcome by some quick edits and views of several things going on at the same time.  I was also impressed with the authentic look of the ""Alabama"" with its bits of rust and crud.  Also another look at the acting suggest the various award nominations for Tom Hanks and Barkhad Abdi are clearly warranted.  Hanks final scene remains fixed in my memory.  Finally, this is another near perfect movie by Paul Greengrass, who excels in these action thrillers.The Blu ray package provides a 1080p video resolution with a 2.39:1 aspect ratio.  It looks perfect.  Somewhat surprisingly, the colors are excellent given the mostly shipboard based film.  But the ocean looks very lifelike.  The actors are bruised up, always sweating and look very tired.  The skin textures and detail leave no doubt as to the character's condition.  If anything the audio track is even better.  Using a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack, the disc handles both the small ambient sounds early in the film and the crescendo of concluding fireworks.  I had just tweaked my subwoofers and they came to attention as the action got going.  The dialog is easily understood including the halting English spoken by the pirates.  Subtitles are available in English, English SDH, Spanish and French.  Extras include an audio commentary by Greengrass and a 3-part documentary (about 1 hour total), a DVD and UV Digital copy and some previews.",5,(BLU RAY REVIEW) 4 1/2 stars for a tension filled real life thriller,1381622400,"10 13, 2013",2013,3885,"['Theatrical', 'review', 'may', 'be', 'spoilers.Director', 'Paul', 'Greengrass', 'rarely', 'two', 'Bourne', 'movies', 'OMG', 'United', '93', 'film', 'based', 'real', 'events', 'film', 'feel', 'dramatic', 'accuracy', 'similar', 'United', '93', 'film', 'one', 'mix', 'veteran', 'actors', 'effective', 'group', 'newbies.Tom', 'Hanks', 'veteran', 'actor', 'who', 'really', 'memorable', 'performance', 'Phillips', 'captain', 'U.', 'S.', 'flagged', 'freighter', 'crew', 'are', 'caught', 'off', 'Somali', 'coast', 'heroic', 'efforts', 'are', 'ultimately', 'boarded', 'handful', 'armed', 'pirates', 'Most', 'filmmakers', 'would', 'likely', 'have', 'eschewed', 'back', 'story', 'how', 'pirates', 'got', 'profession', 'taking', 'cargo', 'crew', 'hostages', 'Greengrass', 'screenwriter', 'Billy', 'Ray', 'take', 'time', 'see', 'how', 'fishermen', 'become', 'criminals', ""n't"", 'make', 'what', 'do', 'more', 'acceptable', 'give', 'understanding.Greengrass', 'audience', 'wrapped', 'up', 'tight', 'pirates', 'search', 'ship', 'hiding', 'crew', 'Only', 'Phillips', '2', 'crewmen', 'bridge', 'are', 'being', 'held', 'Phillips', 'calm', 'best', 'keep', 'crew', 'safe', 'Tension', 'mounts', 'Somalis', 'led', 'Muse', 'remarkable', 'Barkhad', 'Abdi', 'take', 'Phillips', '30K', 'safe', 'ocean', 'capsule-like', 'lifeboat', 'U.', 'S.', 'Navy', 'lifeboat', 'refusing', 'allow', 'enter', 'Somalian', 'mainland.The', 'standoff', 'up', 'again', 'especially', 'S.E.A.L', 'team', 'called', 'crew', 'snacking', 'what', 'assume', 'are', 'coco', 'leaves', 'become', 'more', 'more', 'agitated', 'Especially', 'Najee', 'Faysal', 'Ahmed', 'who', 'would', 'scare', 'hell', 'anyone', 'high-as-a-kite', 'condition', 'waving', '.45', 'semi-automatic', 'pistol', 'Greengrass', ""n't"", 'give', 'audience', 'lot', 'time', 'celebrate', 'Phillips', 'ultimate', 'extraction', 'either', 'where', 'Hanks', 'will', 'likely', 'draw', 'Oscar', 'votes', 'state', 'shock', 'authentic', 'Phillips', 'be', 'coaxed', 'breathe', 'ship', 'corpsman', 'Hell', 'felt', 'was', 'bringing', 'same', 'state', 'brilliant', 'piece', 'filmmaking', 'One', 'year', 'best.BLU', 'RAY', 'UPDATE', '6-3-14', 'second', 'viewing', 'remarkable', 'film', 'allowed', 'look', 'bit', 'closer', 'technical', 'aspects', 'film', 'was', 'immediately', 'struck', 'editing', 'Christopher', 'Rouse', 'Let', 'face', 'middle', 'part', 'action', 'based', 'drama', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'challenge', 'keep', 'interesting', 'Much', 'middle', 'slog', 'overcome', 'quick', 'edits', 'views', 'several', 'things', 'going', 'same', 'time', 'was', 'also', 'impressed', 'authentic', 'look', 'Alabama', 'bits', 'rust', 'crud', 'Also', 'look', 'acting', 'suggest', 'various', 'award', 'nominations', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Barkhad', 'Abdi', 'are', 'clearly', 'warranted', 'Hanks', 'final', 'scene', 'fixed', 'memory', 'Finally', 'near', 'perfect', 'movie', 'Paul', 'Greengrass', 'who', 'action', 'thrillers.The', 'Blu', 'ray', 'package', '1080p', 'video', 'resolution', '2.39:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'perfect', 'Somewhat', 'surprisingly', 'colors', 'are', 'excellent', 'given', 'mostly', 'shipboard', 'based', 'film', 'ocean', 'very', 'lifelike', 'actors', 'are', 'bruised', 'up', 'always', 'sweating', 'look', 'very', 'tired', 'skin', 'textures', 'detail', 'leave', 'doubt', 'character', 'condition', 'anything', 'audio', 'track', 'even', 'better', 'Using', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', '5.1', 'soundtrack', 'disc', 'small', 'ambient', 'early', 'film', 'crescendo', 'concluding', 'fireworks', 'had', 'just', 'tweaked', 'subwoofers', 'came', 'attention', 'action', 'got', 'going', 'dialog', 'easily', 'understood', 'including', 'halting', 'English', 'spoken', 'pirates', 'Subtitles', 'are', 'available', 'English', 'English', 'SDH', 'Spanish', 'French', 'Extras', 'include', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Greengrass', '3-part', 'documentary', '1', 'hour', 'total', 'DVD', 'UV', 'Digital', 'copy', 'previews']",N/A

Perhaps best, it's based(and pretty accurately from what I understand) on the piracy event off the Somali coast of a couple years ago.  First of all, the depiction of how the captain and crew prevented the Somali pirates from taking the ship Maersk Alabama when they were onboard is a tribute to their ingenuity.  That they managed to get a weapon away from the terrorists(because that's what they are) and get them to leave the ship is a tribute to their courage and intelligence.  That they took the captain hostage was bad, but it would have been so much worse had they had 20 hostages rather than one.  It is also a tribute to Captain Phillips and the seal team snipers, who acted with courage and skill to take out the pirates.The one thing that bothered me was the fact that the commercial ship was totally unarmed.  With just one captured automatic weapon, the crew managed to get the four other pirates(all armed with automatic weapons) to leave the ship.  Had the crew had one automatic weapon before the encounter instead of some ineffective water cannons to fire down at the approaching pirates, the four pirates would never have been able to climb aboard and take the Alabama in the first place.  Gun control does not work because the disarmed are at the mercy of any barbarian with a gun.  Commercial ships in that part of the world should be armed.  Otherwise they are just big targets.It is amusing that probably the best movie I've seen in over a year is based on a true story and not appreciated by the Academy.

1556976,A11TUHEHHENLBC,B008JFUNKU,"Patrick L. Boyle ""Mr. Wonderful""","[0, 0]","The first story in Suetonius's &#34;Twelve Caesars&#34; is about how Julius Caesar dealt with his pirates. There's a lesson there.Caesar was a young man when he was sent to Greece to learn rhetoric. On the voyage home his ship was captured by the Cilician Pirates. The Mediterranean was indeed a 'Roman Lake' since the end of the Punic Wars. No nation could oppose them but Rome couldn't or wouldn't  control the many pirates. Some years later Pompey got a commission to wipe the seas clean of pirates and he did so in only a year. But this was before Caesar was captured.The pirates relied on the inability of the captured prisoners to remember the sea coast to their den. They brought the prisoners back to their camp and held them until they were ransomed. They had done this for years but no prisoner could describe just how to find their camp along the rugged seacoast. But Caesar wasn't an ordinary fellow with an ordinary mind and sense of purpose.When he was ransomed he led a Roman fleet back along the route he had memorized and caught them all. He then had all fifty of them crucified.That's still a good policy towards pirates.Pirates are enemies of all people and should be wiped out wherever they are found. Real pirates are not like Johnny Depp - who is effeminate, wears a lot of eye makeup and is fun to watch. Real pirates are more like gangs of serial killers. Crucifixion requires close contact. It's not really needed. In modern times were have aircraft, with which we could drop chemical and/or biological weapons. We could scour the whole Somali sea coast for twenty miles inland. After a few bombing missions no Somali's would live near the water again. We have at other times and other places established 'No Fly Zones'. We should simply declare the whole coastline a 'No Float Zone'.The first thing that bothered me about the movie was that it showed that we knew where Somali pirates lived an didn't bomb them. The next was the defense that the &lt;I>Alabama Maersk&lt;/I> employed. In WWII the comparable cargo ship would have been a Liberty Ship. The modern container ship is a bit bigger and much faster and better equipped than the old fashion Liberty Ships. But there was one big difference. A typical Liberty Ship was armed with three 20 mm cannon, a three inch cannon, and a five incher. A modern container ship like the &lt;I>Alabama Maersk&lt;/I>  would only need a single fifty caliber machine gun (Ma Deuce) to be safe fro these tiny pirate boats with teenagers armed with AK-47s. The Liberty Ships seldom got to use their armament. Many just broke in two spontaneously and others were torpedoed from below. But it would have been crazy for a Liberty Ship to sail in hostile waters unarmed.Pirates had captured and killed crews from other ships just before this voyage. Yet these men went into hostile waters against armed pirates with only water hoses to protect them. Crazy.I understand that the real Captain Phillips is not well liked by his own crew or many other crews he has worked with. I don't much care. I also understand that the real hero in this incident was another crew member not Phillips. Again I don't care. It cost the producers something like $50 million to get this story into theaters. They spent plenty to just get Hanks. You can hardly blame them for twisting the screen play a little to make it more commercial.From what I read on Wikipedia the movie is mostly accurate to the real story.

1556982,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B008JFUNKU,Paul Allaer,"[2, 3]","""Captain Phillips"" (2013 release; 133 min.) brings the real life story of Captain Rich Phillips and his crew aboard the Maersk Alabama on their way delivering cargo from Oman to Kenya in April, 2009. That journey requires them to go through the Somali basin, where ship hijackings have become a huge problem. In a parallel story line, we are introduced to a group of Somalis who have only one thing on their minds: to attack cargo ships and demand ransom for the crew. Phillips, aware of the dangers, is preparing his ship and his crew for the possibility of a pirate attack and everyone participates in security drills. It isn't long before several boats with Somalis appear on the horizon, heading for the Maersk Alabama.... At this point we are about 30 min. into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is a rousing adventure movie from start to finish. The fact that it is based on a true story makes it even more compelling. No wonder then that this movie is directed by Paul Greengrass, who has brought us several other top-notch action/adventure movies (The Bourne Supremacy/Ultimatum; Green Zone) as well as the 9/11 movie United 93. Tom Hanks as Captain Phillips delivers his best role in years. I will admit that I hesitated long and hard before I finally went to see it just this past weekend, because only months ago I saw another movie dealing with modern day piracy off the coast of Somali and also based on true events: ""A Hijacking"" (2012 release from Denmark) played briefly in theatres in the US and is now available on DVD/Blu-ray. Contrary to ""Captain Phillips"", it is NOT an action/adventure movie, but rather a psychological thriller, focusing on the negotiations between the Somali pirates and the Danes. It is an incredible movie as well, and I recommend that you seek it out.Bottom line: I was pleasantly surprised with ""Captain Phillips"", perhaps because it is so different, both in style and substance, from ""A Hijacking"". I would not be surprised at all if ""Captain Phillips"" does very well in the upcoming awards season, and deservedly so.

It was decent, but it wasn&#8217;t Best Picture of the Year material.4. Half of the movie takes place on a cramped cargo ship. The other half takes place on an even more cramped lifeboat. This isn&#8217;t exactly epic.5. It was filmed on exact replicas of the ship and the lifeboat.6. It&#8217;s really interesting in terms of seeing how modern-day pirates operate, and how the US retaliates.7. The story itself is pretty predictable. You&#8217;ve got the Good Guy, the Bad Guy Who Isn&#8217;t Really Bad, the Real Bad Guy, and the Teenager That&#8217;s In Over His Head. The fact that the Good Guy is Tom Hanks takes away a lot of the suspense about who is going to live. I didn&#8217;t know the real story, but I knew how the movie was going to end about halfway through.8. Tom Hanks does a good job, but he&#8217;s always the same. In this movie, he&#8217;s just Tom Hanks with a Boston accent.9. The real standout actor is Barkhad Abdi, who plays the Somali pirate captain. He was excellent and deserves an award.",4,interesting but predictable,1390867200,"01 28, 2014",2014,1373,"['Nine', 'Things', 'Film', '8220', 'Captain', 'Phillips', '8221', '1', 'Based', 'true', 'story', 'merchant', 'mariner', 'cargo', 'ship', 'hijacked', 'Somali', 'pirates', '2009.2', 'was', 'directed', 'guy', 'made', 'couple', '8220', 'Bourne', '8221', 'movies.3', 'was', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Picture', '2013', '8217', 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'was', 'decent', '8217', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Year', 'material.4', 'Half', 'movie', 'place', 'cramped', 'cargo', 'ship', 'other', 'half', 'place', 'even', 'more', 'cramped', 'lifeboat', 'isn', '8217', 'exactly', 'epic.5', 'was', 'filmed', 'exact', 'replicas', 'ship', 'lifeboat.6', '8217', 'really', 'interesting', 'terms', 'seeing', 'how', 'modern-day', 'pirates', 'operate', 'how', 'US', 'retaliates.7', 'story', 'pretty', 'predictable', '8217', 'got', 'Good', 'Guy', 'Bad', 'Guy', 'Who', 'Isn', '8217', 'Really', 'Bad', 'Real', 'Bad', 'Guy', 'Teenager', 'That', '8217', 's', 'Head', 'fact', 'Good', 'Guy', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'away', 'lot', 'suspense', 'who', 'going', 'live', 'didn', '8217', 'know', 'real', 'story', 'knew', 'how', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'end', 'halfway', 'through.8', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'good', 'job', '8217', 'always', 'same', 'movie', '8217', 's', 'just', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Boston', 'accent.9', 'real', 'standout', 'actor', 'Barkhad', 'Abdi', 'who', 'Somali', 'pirate', 'captain', 'was', 'excellent', 'award']",N/A

1556992,A1S2M6SA4OAUNK,B008JFUNKU,Perry,"[148, 167]","One word, ""Phenomenal"" I could literally stop this review right there!  I was invited to the first screening of the movie in Tampa and after having watched the trailer I knew for sure this was a movie I didn't want to miss.  I accepted the invite and printed my tickets and informed friends of the screening so they could get theirs and then we waited for the day to arrive.  In the meantime I began to research the story of the MV Maersk Alabama and the related hijackings.First let me say this movie is a true story and seemed to match the details of the original story very accurately as it was based on the book ""A Captain's Duty"" penned by the man Richard Phillips himself and the screenplay was adapted from his book by Billy Ray.The story begins introducing us to Captain Richard ""Rich"" Phillips and humanizes him through a discussion with his wife about their children.  Within a few minutes, we're taken to a small village in Somalia where a band thugs arrives to pressure the locals into going back to the work of hijacking Marine Vessels and returning their cargo to the regional warlords where the ship is then ransomed back to the owners.After a failed attempt to board the Maersk Alabama the pirates rejoin their mother ship and repair their boat and add a second engine to help the skiff catch the larger, more powerful vessel.  The Crew users flairs, high pressure water hoses, a series of 30 degree turns in an attempt to fend off the pirates but, all their efforts fail as the ship is boarded and the skiff is sunk. The crew then goes into a series of rehearsed procedures in which most of them hide in the engine room where they take control of the ship and shut it down.  From there two of them risk their lives going above deck to kill the generators which stops emergency lighting and the other retrieves food and water for the men in hiding.In the meantime the pirate captain forces Captain Phillips to take him on a search for the crew to which, he leads one man into a trap that injures the man's feet.  The Captain is then ordered to go with the injured man back to the bridge and he complies.  Of course the rest of the crew seized the opportunity presented to them and overwhelm the Pirate captain.  This sets up the event that would ultimately be the meat of the movie as Captain Phillips is supposed to be exchanged for the Pirate Captain and the pirates are supposed to take the life boat and head home but, they renege on their deal and take Captain Phillips with them.Within a day of being notified the US Navy intercepts the small vessel and the rest of the story really is something you have to witness.  I'm not going to go into much more than this as we're only about 30 minutes into a 2 hour and 10 minute movie and I really recommend seeing this movie as this is my new favorite movie of the year! Seriously, if this doesn't win best picture then Hollywood is an even bigger scam than I could have ever imagined.Captain Richard Phillips is played by Tom Hanks and in my opinion, this is the best acting Tom Hanks has ever done.  For the most part, there's literally nobody else you'll recognize in this movie and given his performance throughout the movie Hanks is more than up to the task of leading the entire cast straight to what is sure to be one award win after another.  The 4 Somali Hijackers also did an outstanding job and they're literally unknowns without a single role to their acting career beyond this movie; they really did an incredible job in their supporting roles.  Seriously, everybody in this film was spot on in their roles and I cannot say enough good things about the acting.As for the political aspect of this movie, there was no swaying from either side and even the decisions made by Obama (this happened during his first term) were only referenced as orders from the White House.Overall, I cannot say enough good things about this film and how deep it really went.  It was a pretty intense and emotional ending which only further sealed this movie, in my opinion, as one of the best movies to come along in several years and it easily bests the majority of the films released in the past 2 years.For the record, Somali Pirates have attempted three more hijackings of the Maersk Alabama since this incident and each time they were turned away by armed security forces so, this shipping company clearly learned from their mistakes.And another note, the Captain actually returned to work within 2 years of the event.*If any of you want to know how to get into these

I wish I had this movie so I could watch it again!This movie is based on the true story about a guy named Richard Phillips who is a captain of a ship. Pirates come and take the captain as hostage. Eventually he is stuck on a life boat with the pirates and the captain just wants to see his family again. Luckily the navy comes but they don&#8217;t want to hurt Captain Phillips so they try to trick the pirates. The movie is very intense and I was on edge the whole time.The main characters in the movie are Captain Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks), Muse (Barkhad Abdi), Bilal (BArkhad Abdirahman), Najee (Faysal Ahmen), and Elmi Mahat M. Ali). My favorite character in this movie is Captain Phillips because he is really nice and he would rather sacrifice his own life for his crew. That shows how much he cares about other people. It really made me think about what I would do in this type of situation.My favorite part in the movie is when they capture the captain because that&#8217;s when the action really starts. It&#8217;s not good that he gets captured but you see a lot of action after that. You see the navy show up, you hear threats from the pirates, you see helicopters in the air. Everything goes crazy!

Most of us remember reading about the hijacking of the Maersk Alabama by Somali pirates; the heroic actions by Captain Phillips; and the precision rescue by U. S. Navy personnel; and director Paul Greengrass has crafted the film to fit the news reporting as I remember it. And Greengrass crafts a top notch actioner...the pacing is such that a long film at 134 minutes actually seems much shorter; there are no dead spots and no wasted footage. The Somali pirates, while appropriately villainous, are not presented as totally ruthless...there is a level of sympathy attached to them. The actors who play them do a fine job. My oldest grandson (he's 15) and I watched it and thoroughly enjoyed it...unless the aforementioned controversy affects the jury, I'm betting this film will earn at least a Best Picture nomination.",5,"""I am the captain now!""",1392681600,"02 18, 2014",2014,1115,"['controversy', 'real', 'Merchant', 'Mariner', 'Captain', 'Richard', 'Phillips', 'doubt', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'characterization', 'Phillips', 'biopic', 'absolutely', 'masterful', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'years', 'should', 'garner', 'least', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Most', 'remember', 'reading', 'hijacking', 'Maersk', 'Alabama', 'Somali', 'pirates', 'heroic', 'actions', 'Captain', 'Phillips', 'precision', 'rescue', 'U.', 'S.', 'Navy', 'personnel', 'director', 'Paul', 'Greengrass', 'crafted', 'film', 'fit', 'news', 'reporting', 'remember', 'Greengrass', 'crafts', 'top', 'notch', 'actioner', 'pacing', 'such', 'long', 'film', '134', 'minutes', 'actually', 'much', 'shorter', 'are', 'dead', 'spots', 'wasted', 'footage', 'Somali', 'pirates', 'appropriately', 'villainous', 'are', 'not', 'presented', 'totally', 'ruthless', 'level', 'sympathy', 'attached', 'actors', 'who', 'play', 'do', 'fine', 'job', 'oldest', 'grandson', '15', 'watched', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'aforementioned', 'controversy', 'jury', ""'m"", 'betting', 'film', 'will', 'earn', 'least', 'Best', 'Picture', 'nomination']",N/A

Hanks, as always, gives an excellent performance.  This film is based upon Captain Phillips' own account of the incident.The elephant in the room is the question as to why on Earth this cargo ship sailed unarmed into one of the most dangerous areas in the world.  The short answer is that the insurance companies that provide coverage for these vessels insist upon it, for whatever stupid reason.  Thus, a 21st Century wonder like this cargo vessel can be successfully overcome by illiterate primitives with a few rifles in skiffs powered by outboard motors.  I found myself having to struggle to enjoy the movie simply because the idea that the crew of the cargo ship were without weapons seemed like a peculiar form of insanity.  So instead, when the ship notifies the local naval force that they are being attacked by pirates, they are advised to ""deploy your fire hoses...""  Fire hoses are for putting out fires, not for standing up to gunmen armed with AK-47s.  This was stupidity on a grand scale.  Not Captain Phillips' fault, of course.  These were the orders he and his crew received.If you can get past the stupidity of whoever put this cargo vessel in harm's way completely unarmed, this is a tense, gripping, and accurate film.  Of course, eventually heroic men with guns, i.e. the US Navy and its Seals, were called in to save the day and the ending will make anyone proud of America's armed forces.  But what form of insanity requires brave men like Captain Phillips and his crew to present themselves as unarmed targets to these savages?  That is the real question that this film never answers.

1557065,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B008JFUNKU,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 2]","Based on an event that garnered worldwide attention in 2009, &#8220;Captain Phillips&#8221; tells the tale of two total strangers, both hailing from opposites corners of the earth, who are brought together by circumstance and fate.One of those individuals is Richard Phillips, the captain of an unarmed cargo ship sailing through international waters off the coast of Africa en route to Mombasa, and the other is Abduwali Muse, the leader of a band of Somali pirates who are determined to board the ship and hold its captain and crew hostage for ransom.Billy Ray has based his screenplay on the book &#8220;A Captain&#8217;s Duty&#8221; by Steven Talty and Phillips himself. The movie, directed with his usual taut precision by Paul Greengrass, relates the story in step-by-step detail, exploring the relationship between these two wildly disparate but equally desperate captains, as a thrilling real-life drama plays itself out on the high seas. While Phillips&#8217; self-sacrificing heroism - and that of the Navy Seals who successfully took out three of the four pirates - takes center stage in the drama, Ray is still able to give Abduwali his due, making it clear that the young man has been driven to this action as much out of desperation as out of greed or criminal intent, since illegal fishing and the dumping of toxic waste on the part of foreigners in that area have pretty much depleted the Somali fishing grounds, leaving men like Abduwali without any viable means of supporting themselves and their families. Sadly, piracy becomes the next obvious step in the struggle for survival. It would have been easy to have turned Abduwali and his cohorts into one-dimensional villains, but, to their credit, Ray and Greengrass have chosen not to do so.This complexity of character is attributable in no small measure to the outstanding performances by veteran Tom Hanks and newcomer Barkhad Abdi, who earned an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his work here. Together, they create a human dynamic that carries the film far beyond the heart-stopping, race-against-the-clock surface aspects of the drama. Not that the visceral is in any way slighted, for in true Greengrass fashion, the film moves along at a breakneck pace, rarely slowing down to give the audience a chance to catch its breath along the way.By far, the most effective scene in the movie comes right near the end, after Phillips has been rescued and is taken to the ship&#8217;s trauma center to ascertain his physical and mental condition. Unlike the vast majority of movies and TV shows in which characters who are subjected to horrifying circumstances seem to bounce back from them almost immediately, &#8220;Captain Phillips&#8221; shows us the true human response to a life-shattering, traumatic event (thanks in no small measure to Hanks&#8216; magnificent acting).It is just this type of insightful verisimilitude that informs each and every moment of &#8220;Captain Phillips.&#8221;",4,Action the Greengrass way,1402099200,"06 7, 2014",2014,2977,"['Based', 'event', 'garnered', 'worldwide', 'attention', '2009', '8220', 'Captain', 'Phillips', '8221', 'tale', 'two', 'total', 'strangers', 'hailing', 'opposites', 'corners', 'earth', 'who', 'are', 'brought', 'together', 'circumstance', 'fate.One', 'individuals', 'Richard', 'Phillips', 'captain', 'unarmed', 'cargo', 'ship', 'sailing', 'international', 'waters', 'coast', 'Africa', 'en', 'route', 'Mombasa', 'other', 'Abduwali', 'Muse', 'leader', 'band', 'Somali', 'pirates', 'who', 'are', 'determined', 'board', 'ship', 'hold', 'captain', 'crew', 'hostage', 'ransom.Billy', 'Ray', 'based', 'screenplay', 'book', '8220', 'A', 'Captain', '8217', 'Duty', '8221', 'Steven', 'Talty', 'Phillips', 'movie', 'directed', 'usual', 'taut', 'precision', 'Paul', 'Greengrass', 'story', 'step-by-step', 'detail', 'exploring', 'relationship', 'two', 'wildly', 'disparate', 'equally', 'desperate', 'captains', 'thrilling', 'real-life', 'drama', 'out', 'high', 'seas', 'Phillips', '8217', 'self-sacrificing', 'heroism', 'Navy', 'Seals', 'who', 'successfully', 'took', 'out', 'three', 'four', 'pirates', 'center', 'stage', 'drama', 'Ray', 'still', 'able', 'give', 'Abduwali', 'due', 'making', 'clear', 'young', 'man', 'been', 'driven', 'action', 'as', 'much', 'desperation', 'greed', 'criminal', 'intent', 'illegal', 'fishing', 'dumping', 'toxic', 'waste', 'part', 'foreigners', 'area', 'have', 'pretty', 'much', 'depleted', 'Somali', 'fishing', 'grounds', 'leaving', 'men', 'Abduwali', 'viable', 'means', 'supporting', 'families', 'Sadly', 'piracy', 'next', 'obvious', 'step', 'struggle', 'survival', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'easy', 'have', 'turned', 'Abduwali', 'cohorts', 'one-dimensional', 'villains', 'credit', 'Ray', 'Greengrass', 'have', 'chosen', 'not', 'do', 'so.This', 'complexity', 'character', 'attributable', 'small', 'measure', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'veteran', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'newcomer', 'Barkhad', 'Abdi', 'who', 'earned', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'work', 'here', 'Together', 'create', 'human', 'dynamic', 'film', 'far', 'heart-stopping', 'race-against-the-clock', 'surface', 'aspects', 'drama', 'Not', 'visceral', 'way', 'slighted', 'true', 'Greengrass', 'fashion', 'film', 'moves', 'along', 'breakneck', 'pace', 'rarely', 'slowing', 'down', 'give', 'audience', 'chance', 'catch', 'breath', 'way.By', 'far', 'most', 'effective', 'scene', 'movie', 'right', 'end', 'Phillips', 'been', 'rescued', 'taken', 'ship', '8217', 'trauma', 'center', 'ascertain', 'physical', 'mental', 'condition', 'vast', 'majority', 'movies', 'TV', 'shows', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'subjected', 'horrifying', 'circumstances', 'seem', 'bounce', 'back', 'almost', 'immediately', '8220', 'Captain', 'Phillips', '8221', 'true', 'human', 'response', 'life-shattering', 'traumatic', 'event', 'thanks', 'small', 'measure', 'Hanks', '8216', 'magnificent', 'acting', '.It', 'just', 'type', 'insightful', 'verisimilitude', 'moment', '8220', 'Captain', 'Phillips.', '8221']",N/A

However.... this movie is supposed to be based on events in and around 2009 and for that it's terrible.  Just Google &#34;Captain Phillips The Real Story&#34; and you'll see what I mean.  The screenplay was adapted from the Phillips' book as he recalls the hijacking of his vessel.  But Phillips omitted many truths of that week and he lied about others.  And Sony Pictures will have you believe that this movie is true.  Sony went so far to hide the truth that they paid some (but not all) of the 20 crew members with Phillips $5000.00 and had them sign non-disclosure agreements stating they they could not divulge the truth.  Other crew members refused to make the deal with the Devil and have since launch a lawsuit against the shipping line and Phillips.  When the hijacking had ended and Phillips was safely back home, the crew swore that they would not disclose the truth about Phillip's conduct for it truly painted him in an unfavourable light.  However, once Phillips' book came out and he played up the &#34;hero&#34; card in the media, the crew was disgusted with actions and decided to right a dreadful wrong.  For you see, Phillips as an employee of the shipping line ignored six emails send to him instructing him to keep his vessel 600 nm away from the Somali coast.  When the Maersk Alabama was raided by the pirates, the ship was 234 nm east of the coastline.  He therefore put himself and his crew in harms way.  Phillips excuse was it didn't matter how far the ship was away from the Somali coast, they were going to get boarded anyways.  Not true.  600 nm would have been beyond the range of the pirate's motherships.  Phillips also never offered up himself to the pirates to save his crew.  The movie shows Phillips conducting a security drill when the hijackers attempted their first attack.  However, the drill in question was a fire drill and it was during this exercise that the Somali skiffs first appeared.  The Mate suggested that they end the drill and prepare the ship, however Phillips ordered the crew to complete the drill.  Poor judgement on his part.  The crew claims that the real hero was the Chief Officer.  Some of his heroics were vented in the movie, but not enough to overshadow the fictional movie character as portrayed by Tom Hanks.  Phillips as described by his crew is a self-centred, egotistical, arrogant person prone to poor judgements.  Not the type of character that you would wish to showcase in a movie and certainly not how Phillips wants to be seen as, especially after he wrote his book and has accepted all of the media's kudos for the hero that they paint him out to be.  Once again Hollywood takes a good story and distorts the truth all for the sake of turning a buck.

1557129,A2I7NGKA8LPN89,B008JFUNKU,Stacy Hackney (formerly customerS),"[0, 0]","Tom Hanks is excellent as usual and the outstanding actors playing the Somali pirates were frightening, making you almost believe they were pirates. If Captain Phillips behaved anything like portrayed in the film, he is a remarkable and brave man. Negatives for me were the music was too intense to much of the time, didn't care for so much handheld camera work, didn't care for the choppy editing, I guess director was going for a documentary look. Feels slightly propaganda-ish with the Navy saving the day, and casting Tom Hanks, and the sometimes slightly friendly conversations between the Tom Hanks' character and the pirates after his kidnap: seemed unlikely that those conversations would take place as many times as they did, and the way that they did. For a captive fearing for his life, the Captain seemed overly talkative. I liked his intelligence and initiative though. If this part of the story was accurate, if the Captain was that functional under pressure, the writer should've shown that side of the Captain, pre-heist, so it'd be more believable during the kidnapping. It might've happened similar to this in real life, but the writer should've made the Captain's behavior believable in the story, in other words, the fact that the Captain was so good under pressure should've been established earlier in the story so that I could accept it as truth when it mattered. As filmed, there seemed too many conversations between captive and pirates, it seemed too ""Hollywoody."" If the Captain was really like this during his kidnapping ordeal or if the writer wanted me to believe that the Captain was like this, he/she should've established that part of the Captain's character earlier in the story.It's impossible to be pro-pirate, though what are peasants along coastal countries to do if larger more powerful countries illegally fish off their coasts, depleting the fish stock and drying up their livelihood. I'm not accusing America of doing this, I just saw a BBC documentary on Youtube called the Future of Food, parts 1 through 3, which discusses just such an issue from African fishermen point of view, and the trawler illegally fishing their waters was a Spanish ship, not an American one.  In this story, the Somali head pirate poses just such a question, what do fishermen do when their traditional livelihood dries up through no fault of their own. Absolutely no justification for kidnapping and harming other innocent citizens. This film shows how impoverished fishermen and peasants can be forced into a life of crime, get caught up in the violence and perpetuate the violence themselves, and get in over their heads.  What I liked about the story is that it showed how their Warlord forced them into criminal activity; also liked how story showed how peasants are used: the lead pirate said he'd taken a ship hostage a year ago and gotten $6 million. He couldn't explain to Tom Hanks' character why he was still pirating after that heist: it showed that the Warlord took all the money, especially clear when you consider the opening scenes where you see the pirates, pre-heist, living in abject poverty.

1557131,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B008JFUNKU,Stephanie De Pue,"[4, 7]","Captain Phillips, (2013). A biographical  and action/adventure flick, this is the true story of Captain Richard Phillips and the 2009 hijacking by Somali pirates of the US-flagged MV Maersk Alabama, the first American cargo ship to be hijacked in two hundred years.  It is based upon the book A CAPTAINS DUTY: SOMALI PIRATES, NAVY SEALS, AND DANGEROUS DAYS AT SEA by Richard Phillips.  Screenplay was by Billy Ray; direction by British Paul Greengrass, acclaimed master of suspense, when logically there should be none, see UNITED  93, the Bourne films.To quote Sony Pictures Entertainment, the releasing studio, as reprinted at IMDb:Captain Phillips is a multi-layered examination of the 2009 hijacking of the U.S. container ship Maersk Alabama by a crew of Somali pirates. It is - through director Paul Greengrass's distinctive lens - simultaneously a pulse-pounding thriller, and a complex portrait of the myriad effects of globalization. The film focuses on the relationship between the Alabama's commanding officer, Captain Richard Phillips (two time Academy Award-winner Tom Hanks), and the Somali pirate captain, Muse (Barkhad Abdi), who takes him hostage. Phillips and Muse are set on an unstoppable collision course when Muse and his crew target Phillips' unarmed ship; in the ensuing standoff, 145 miles off the Somali coast, both men will find themselves at the mercy of forces beyond their control.Hanks ably carries the picture  in another Oscar-worthy performance.  Bdi, portraying Muse, powerfully balances Hanks.  Catherine Keener is featured in a small part as Andrea Phillips, the Captain&#8217;s wife.  The movie  is 134 minutes of pure, heart-stopping suspense.  Though, logically speaking, we know that Phillips survived.  Also, logically speaking, we know that this handful of pirates as portrayed, half-dressed, probably hardly half-fed and educated, stoned on &#8220;khat,&#8221; and probably no better off than their pirate ancestors of centuries ago, who inspired the line &#8220;the shores of Tripoli,&#8221; in the U.S. Marine anthem, cannot possibly prevail against the might of the twenty-first century U.S. Navy.  Which has clearly spent millions of dollars in men and materiel to ensure that the captain is freed.  Nevertheless, the film left me limp.

The film too some creative license, and you already know the outcome. The only reason I wanted to comment is that it would have been so easy for the crew to over power the pirates with all the tools and equipment they have. They were strong men, and the pirates are weak, not clever, and not paying attention with their Bulgarian made AK-47's. It is almost impossible to believe that four skinnies could take such a huge ship when there are so many chances to bash their heads in.The Navy does a great job, but if the cargo ships were able to have 1)Wilson Combat Shotguns,  2, Mount Mini-Guns, 3) Have a few hand grenades and phosphorous bombs, and sidearms as well as AR 10's, there is no way they could be boarded even with four or five private contractors. Seems like insurance companies would DEMAND this. In port the weapons can be locked up. But these guys manage to take the whole ship with a cheap aluminum skiff and no plans. Time for sea marshals or contractors that ca fight. Even basic martial arts would have defeated them the way they held their rifles and pistols and it would have all been over.  Flame throwers would be useful to and simple RPG right to the skiff. They would never even get close. That part was frustrating as the passiveness of the crew allowed very weak pirates and very few to board. Drop boiling oil on their heads for gosh sakes and they would never get close.

1557134,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B008JFUNKU,Steven Aldersley,"[1, 3]","I was a huge Tom Hanks fan in the 1990s and the early part of the 2000s, but it's been a while since he turned in an exceptional performance. I enjoyed The Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons, but Hanks hasn't been great since Cast Away 12 years ago. After hearing the early buzz about Captain Phillips, I was hoping one of my favorite actors would return to peak form.Although Hanks didn't put a foot wrong, I came away a little disappointed. Let me explain why.We meet Rich Phillips (Hanks) as he is driving to the airport with his wife, Andrea (Catherine Keener). This introduction is somewhat brief, and Catherine Keener plays no further part in the movie. What it does do is allow us to see how Phillips prepares for a trip. He's aware of the dangers of piracy, but he's an experienced man.The next characters we meet are the pirates. This introduction is a much longer segment, and is extremely chaotic. We learn that life is hard for these Somali pirates and that they have bosses that they have to answer to. These people felt like standard villains to me, and we end up knowing little about them despite the length of time spent showing us their homeland. They talk in heavy accents when they do speak  English, and they have bad teeth. Yep, these are the people we are supposed to hate.Some of the most impressive scenes in the movie happen near the beginning as we see Phillips go about his routine. Hanks is particularly good at playing understated roles, and he's completely believable. The tone changes when the inevitable meeting with the pirates occurs. If you were to sit down and guess what kind of things might happen from this point, you would probably be pretty close. I know the movie is supposed to be based on real events, so I can't deduct points for lack of originality, but there aren't many surprises.I'm not going to delve into the plot beyond these scenes which all take place in the first 30 minutes. Anything more would venture too deeply into spoiler territory.Paul Greengrass also directed The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum, which are among the best action movies I own. If you are familiar with those, it won't surprise you to learn that Greengrass employs similar techniques in Captain Phillips. He tries to enhance the action by showing extreme closeups and point of view shots, intended to place us right in the middle of the action. You can also expect to see plenty of shaky cam effects. Although this worked quite well, it will definitely annoy some viewers.Captain Phillips is a tense account of what can happen in dangerous waters. When you see all of the events transpire, you might be wondering whether it wouldn't be cheaper and safer to hire a few armed guards if you're transporting cargo through the region in question. The ultimate resolution was infinitely more expensive.I'm happy enough with Captain Phillips, and will be adding it to my collection, but I'm still waiting for a role meaty enough to extract another Oscar-worthy performance from Tom Hanks. Don't avoid it, but temper expectations a little.Overall score 3.75/5",4,"Good Hanks, but he can do better with the right material",1382227200,"10 20, 2013",2013,3088,"['was', 'huge', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'fan', '1990s', 'early', 'part', '2000s', 'been', 'while', 'turned', 'exceptional', 'performance', 'enjoyed', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'Angels', 'Demons', 'Hanks', ""n't"", 'been', 'great', 'Cast', 'Away', '12', 'years', 'ago', 'hearing', 'early', 'buzz', 'Captain', 'Phillips', 'was', 'hoping', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'would', 'return', 'peak', 'form.Although', 'Hanks', 'did', ""n't"", 'put', 'foot', 'wrong', 'came', 'away', 'little', 'disappointed', 'Let', 'explain', 'why.We', 'meet', 'Rich', 'Phillips', 'Hanks', 'driving', 'airport', 'wife', 'Andrea', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'introduction', 'somewhat', 'brief', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'further', 'part', 'movie', 'What', 'do', 'allow', 'see', 'how', 'Phillips', 'trip', 'aware', 'dangers', 'piracy', 'experienced', 'man.The', 'next', 'characters', 'meet', 'are', 'pirates', 'introduction', 'much', 'longer', 'segment', 'extremely', 'chaotic', 'learn', 'life', 'hard', 'Somali', 'pirates', 'have', 'bosses', 'have', 'answer', 'people', 'felt', 'standard', 'villains', 'end', 'up', 'knowing', 'little', 'length', 'time', 'spent', 'showing', 'homeland', 'talk', 'heavy', 'accents', 'when', 'do', 'speak', 'English', 'have', 'bad', 'teeth', 'Yep', 'are', 'people', 'are', 'supposed', 'hate.Some', 'most', 'impressive', 'scenes', 'movie', 'happen', 'beginning', 'see', 'Phillips', 'go', 'routine', 'Hanks', 'particularly', 'good', 'playing', 'understated', 'roles', 'completely', 'believable', 'tone', 'changes', 'when', 'inevitable', 'meeting', 'pirates', 'occurs', 'were', 'sit', 'down', 'guess', 'what', 'kind', 'things', 'might', 'happen', 'point', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'pretty', 'close', 'know', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'based', 'real', 'events', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deduct', 'points', 'lack', 'originality', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'surprises.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'delve', 'plot', 'scenes', 'take', 'place', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'Anything', 'more', 'would', 'venture', 'too', 'deeply', 'spoiler', 'territory.Paul', 'Greengrass', 'also', 'directed', 'Bourne', 'Supremacy', 'Bourne', 'Ultimatum', 'are', 'best', 'action', 'movies', 'own', 'are', 'familiar', 'wo', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'learn', 'Greengrass', 'similar', 'techniques', 'Captain', 'Phillips', 'enhance', 'action', 'showing', 'extreme', 'closeups', 'point', 'view', 'shots', 'intended', 'place', 'right', 'middle', 'action', 'can', 'also', 'expect', 'see', 'plenty', 'shaky', 'cam', 'effects', 'worked', 'quite', 'well', 'will', 'definitely', 'annoy', 'viewers.Captain', 'Phillips', 'tense', 'account', 'what', 'can', 'happen', 'dangerous', 'waters', 'When', 'see', 'events', 'transpire', 'might', 'be', 'wondering', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'cheaper', 'safer', 'hire', 'few', 'armed', 'guards', ""'re"", 'transporting', 'cargo', 'region', 'question', 'ultimate', 'resolution', 'was', 'infinitely', 'more', 'expensive.I', ""'m"", 'happy', 'enough', 'Captain', 'Phillips', 'will', 'be', 'adding', 'collection', ""'m"", 'still', 'waiting', 'role', 'meaty', 'enough', 'extract', 'Oscar-worthy', 'performance', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Do', ""n't"", 'avoid', 'temper', 'expectations', 'little.Overall', 'score', '3.75/5']",N/A

For instance, the movie opens with a scene of Phillips readying himself for his trip. [It's actually the kind of thing I routinely tell my creative writing class not to do: Do not give us your character waking up in the morning, brushing his teeth and eating breakfast. We don't care. Unless there actually is some relevance to the story. Not that that is what see with Phillips, but it's the same kind of thing, but it does have a point.] It's completely normal and middle class, him going off to the airport. I have to say, though, that the dialogue between Phillips and his wife is terrible. It switches, then, to the character of Muse and how his day starts. It serves to show us how very different these two characters are and, yet, how they are similar. So, yeah, that was interesting, but that's the first 10 minutes or so and nothing's that interesting the rest of the movie.The whole movie can be boiled down to one conversation between Phillips and Muse:Phillips: There has to be something more than fishing and kidnapping people.Muse: Maybe in America. Maybe in America.I think that moment is so short that it gets lost in the rest of the movie. And the movie does nothing to support it, since it focuses on Phillips and not what drove the pirates to do what they do.The thing I was most struck with, though, is not something I think I was meant to think about:The pirates were trying to ransom Phillips for $10 million. In response, we mounted a huge Naval engagement which included airdropping in a bunch of SEALs and an aircraft carrier. The recovery mission took days. I'm sure the cost of the rescue mission dwarfed the 10 million the pirates wanted. I'm not saying we should have paid them off, because I don't that at all. I do think there has to be a better way, though. [And because I was curious, the cost to operate an aircraft carrier per day is $7 million! And it was one of only three Navy ships involved in the mission. The mission which lasted several days. So, yeah, we spent WAY more than $10 million to get Phillips back.]As for the acting, I was unimpressed. Hanks showed up and was appropriately stoic through most of the film. The only real acting he did was at the very end after he was rescued, at which point he has a complete meltdown. That scene with him was great, but the rest of the movie was pretty flat. His acting, all the acting, the whole movie. Let's just say that, overall, I was particularly underwhelmed. It was kind of like watching the &#34;high speed&#34; chase of O.J. Simpson on TV a couple of decades ago. Oh, except for the brief moment where I thought the movie was about to become Home Alone as the crew did things like spread broken glass on the floor for the barefoot pirates to step on. But that didn't last long enough to be engaging.Basically, the movie gets a &#34;meh&#34; from me. It wasn't stupid (which, you know, would have been pretty bad considering it's based on true events), but it also just didn't do anything for me. I never cared about any of the people involved except for brief moments for the &#34;pirate&#34; kid that stepped on the glass; he was only 15-ish. But, then, Muse was only 16-ish (which never comes out in the movie. If they'd highlighted that, there may have been some emotional investment, but, then, it might have been invested in the &#34;bad&#34; guys). This just isn't an Oscar caliber movie. It's better than The Wolf of Wall Street but not by much. It is, however, politically correct, I would suppose.",3,meh,1391385600,"02 3, 2014",2014,4062,"['question', 'kept', 'asking', 'was', 'watching', 'movie', 'have', 'continued', 'ask', 'seeing', 'movie', '34', 'Why', 'did', 'need', 'be', 'movie', '34', 'My', 'wife', 'need', 'have', 'movies', 'year', 'feature', 'American', 'military', 'good', 'guys', ""'m"", 'just', 'not', 'quite', 'buying', 'mean', 'probably', 'true', 'just', ""n't"", 'do', 'me.Yes', 'will', 'be', 'spoilers', 'Not', 'everyone', ""n't"", 'already', 'know', 'how', 'are', 'few', 'interesting', 'parts', 'movie', ""'re"", 'not', 'enough', 'give', 'movie', 'real', 'depth', 'instance', 'movie', 'scene', 'Phillips', 'readying', 'trip', '[', 'actually', 'kind', 'thing', 'routinely', 'tell', 'creative', 'writing', 'class', 'not', 'do', 'Do', 'not', 'give', 'character', 'waking', 'up', 'morning', 'brushing', 'teeth', 'eating', 'breakfast', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'actually', 'relevance', 'story', 'Not', 'what', 'see', 'Phillips', 'same', 'kind', 'thing', 'have', 'point', 'completely', 'normal', 'middle', 'class', 'going', 'airport', 'have', 'say', 'though', 'dialogue', 'Phillips', 'wife', 'terrible', 'then', 'character', 'Muse', 'how', 'day', 'show', 'how', 'very', 'different', 'two', 'characters', 'are', 'yet', 'how', 'are', 'similar', 'So', 'yeah', 'was', 'interesting', 'first', '10', 'minutes', 'so', 'nothing', 'interesting', 'rest', 'movie.The', 'whole', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'boiled', 'down', 'one', 'conversation', 'Phillips', 'Muse', 'Phillips', 'be', 'something', 'more', 'fishing', 'kidnapping', 'people.Muse', 'Maybe', 'America', 'Maybe', 'America.I', 'think', 'moment', 'so', 'short', 'lost', 'rest', 'movie', 'movie', 'nothing', 'support', 'Phillips', 'not', 'what', 'drove', 'pirates', 'do', 'what', 'do.The', 'thing', 'was', 'most', 'struck', 'not', 'something', 'think', 'was', 'meant', 'think', 'pirates', 'were', 'trying', 'ransom', 'Phillips', '10', 'million', 'response', 'mounted', 'huge', 'Naval', 'engagement', 'included', 'airdropping', 'bunch', 'SEALs', 'aircraft', 'carrier', 'recovery', 'mission', 'took', 'days', ""'m"", 'sure', 'cost', 'rescue', 'mission', 'dwarfed', '10', 'million', 'pirates', 'wanted', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'should', 'have', 'paid', 'off', 'do', ""n't"", 'that', 'do', 'think', 'be', 'better', 'way', 'though', '[', 'was', 'curious', 'cost', 'operate', 'aircraft', 'carrier', 'day', '7', 'million', 'was', 'one', 'only', 'three', 'Navy', 'ships', 'involved', 'mission', 'mission', 'lasted', 'several', 'days', 'So', 'yeah', 'spent', 'WAY', 'more', '10', 'million', 'get', 'Phillips', 'back', ']', 'acting', 'was', 'unimpressed', 'Hanks', 'showed', 'up', 'was', 'appropriately', 'stoic', 'most', 'film', 'only', 'real', 'acting', 'did', 'was', 'very', 'end', 'was', 'rescued', 'point', 'complete', 'meltdown', 'scene', 'was', 'great', 'rest', 'movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'flat', 'acting', 'acting', 'whole', 'movie', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'overall', 'was', 'particularly', 'underwhelmed', 'was', 'kind', 'watching', '34', 'high', 'speed', '34', 'chase', 'O.J', 'Simpson', 'TV', 'couple', 'decades', 'ago', 'Oh', 'brief', 'moment', 'where', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'become', 'Home', 'Alone', 'crew', 'did', 'things', 'spread', 'broken', 'glass', 'floor', 'barefoot', 'step', 'did', ""n't"", 'last', 'long', 'enough', 'be', 'engaging.Basically', 'movie', '34', 'meh', '34', 'was', ""n't"", 'stupid', 'know', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'pretty', 'bad', 'considering', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'also', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'never', 'cared', 'people', 'involved', 'brief', 'moments', '34', 'pirate', '34', 'kid', 'stepped', 'glass', 'was', 'only', '15-ish', 'then', 'Muse', 'was', 'only', '16-ish', 'never', 'out', 'movie', ""'d"", 'highlighted', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'emotional', 'investment', 'then', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'invested', '34', 'bad', '34', 'guys', 'just', ""n't"", 'Oscar', 'caliber', 'movie', 'better', 'Wolf', 'Wall', 'Street', 'not', 'much', 'however', 'politically', 'correct', 'would', 'suppose']",N/A

The military is portrayed as tough, smoking cigarettes, and muscular guys that have short one liners to make them look invincible.  The bad guys, whoever they may be, are portrayed as thoughtless and heartless monsters who do not deserve your sympathy.  Captain Phillips does not employ those kind of tactics in this film.Instead of having, cut and dry, good and bad guys, you are told a story where you realize the Somali pirates are not entirely bad human beings.  Mainly, they are poor fisherman that are just trying to survive and hijack ships out of desperation.  I'm glad it was told that way.  At the end, you are happy for the captain, but you are not blindly hating the pirates.  Kudos to the scriptwriter for not taking the easy way out.The film, not counting credits was about two hours and ten minutes long.  It goes by pretty fast, because all the scenes are pertinent to the film.  I could not see them taking out 20-30 minutes out of the film without harming the films overall quality.  It keeps your eyes glued to the movie because, if you miss a scene, you might be missing something pertinent to the story.In relation to the movie, the true story is somewhat different.  Also, it leaves out certain details.  Here is just a small list (Spoilers Ahead):1.  Captain Phillips had been warned to keep at least 600 miles away from the Somali coastline.  Instead, he kept the ship at only 300 miles.  Because of that, the crew does not view him as a hero, but a person who put their lives in danger.  In fact, they are suing the shipping company over the hijacking.2.  There is no broken glass to hurt the hijackers feet in the real story.  That was completely made up and added into the film.3.  He never offered to let the hijackers shoot him instead of one of his crewmen.4.  He was taken hostage in the lifeboat because of a botched prisoner exchange.  It was not because he offered to leave the ship with them.5.  Just to expand on the first point:  The movie as well as the media portrays him as a hero, but his crew thinks the opposite.It should be noted that Captain Phillips never portrays himself as a hero.  That part was created by Hollywood and the media.  They chose to tell the more dramatic story instead of the real one.  That is not his fault.The film is fairly accurate but, keep in mind, some details have been added, while others removed, for the sake of creating a more dramatic story which portrays the Captain in a too heroic fashion.",5,Complex Storytelling,1389052800,"01 7, 2014",2014,2587,"['Usually', 'when', 'see', 'story', 'involving', 'special', 'ops', 'military', 'action', 'story', 'usually', 'told', 'cartoonish', 'way', 'military', 'portrayed', 'tough', 'smoking', 'cigarettes', 'muscular', 'guys', 'have', 'short', 'one', 'liners', 'make', 'look', 'invincible', 'bad', 'guys', 'may', 'be', 'are', 'portrayed', 'thoughtless', 'heartless', 'monsters', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'deserve', 'sympathy', 'Captain', 'Phillips', 'not', 'employ', 'kind', 'tactics', 'film.Instead', 'having', 'cut', 'dry', 'good', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'told', 'story', 'where', 'realize', 'Somali', 'pirates', 'are', 'not', 'entirely', 'bad', 'human', 'beings', 'Mainly', 'are', 'poor', 'fisherman', 'are', 'just', 'trying', 'survive', 'hijack', 'ships', 'desperation', ""'m"", 'glad', 'was', 'told', 'way', 'end', 'are', 'happy', 'captain', 'are', 'not', 'blindly', 'hating', 'pirates', 'Kudos', 'scriptwriter', 'not', 'taking', 'easy', 'way', 'out.The', 'film', 'not', 'counting', 'credits', 'was', 'two', 'hours', 'ten', 'minutes', 'long', 'pretty', 'fast', 'scenes', 'are', 'pertinent', 'film', 'could', 'not', 'see', 'taking', 'out', '20-30', 'minutes', 'film', 'harming', 'films', 'overall', 'quality', 'eyes', 'glued', 'movie', 'miss', 'scene', 'might', 'be', 'missing', 'something', 'pertinent', 'story.In', 'relation', 'movie', 'true', 'story', 'somewhat', 'different', 'Also', 'out', 'certain', 'details', 'Here', 'just', 'small', 'list', 'Spoilers', 'Ahead', ':1', 'Captain', 'Phillips', 'had', 'been', 'warned', 'keep', 'least', '600', 'miles', 'away', 'Somali', 'coastline', 'Instead', 'kept', 'ship', 'only', '300', 'miles', 'crew', 'not', 'view', 'hero', 'person', 'who', 'put', 'lives', 'danger', 'fact', 'are', 'suing', 'shipping', 'company', 'hijacking.2', 'broken', 'glass', 'hurt', 'hijackers', 'feet', 'real', 'story', 'was', 'completely', 'made', 'up', 'added', 'film.3', 'never', 'offered', 'let', 'hijackers', 'shoot', 'instead', 'one', 'crewmen.4', 'was', 'taken', 'hostage', 'lifeboat', 'botched', 'prisoner', 'exchange', 'was', 'not', 'offered', 'leave', 'ship', 'them.5', 'Just', 'expand', 'first', 'point', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'media', 'hero', 'crew', 'opposite.It', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'Captain', 'Phillips', 'never', 'hero', 'part', 'was', 'created', 'Hollywood', 'media', 'chose', 'tell', 'more', 'dramatic', 'story', 'instead', 'real', 'one', 'not', 'fault.The', 'film', 'fairly', 'accurate', 'keep', 'mind', 'details', 'have', 'been', 'added', 'others', 'removed', 'sake', 'creating', 'more', 'dramatic', 'story', 'Captain', 'too', 'heroic', 'fashion']",N/A

1557167,ALJLONJXLA3OQ,B008JFUNKU,The People's Critic,"[5, 7]","In the opening scene of Captain Phillips, Tom Hanks' character, Rich Phillips, has a frank conversation with his wife Andrea (Catherine Keener) while they drive to the airport.  As a teacher, I took special note of this conversation, as it pertained to Phillips' concern regarding his son's performance in school.  He tells his wife that he's worried that the world is far more competitive than it used to be and that even putting in the minimum is not enough to rise above and have a chance at success.  I've delivered various versions of this message to my high school students and while this conversation stood out to me for a different reason than it will to many other theatergoers, this seemingly innocuous scene sets the tone for a far more substantial and contextual film than I had expected.Adapted from Richard Phillips' memoir, Captain Phillips tells the somewhat well-known true story of an American cargo ship hijacked by Somali pirates in the Spring of 2009.  The surprisingly rapid turnaround between original incident and major film production speaks volumes to the merits of the story.  The film presents a form of ""bio-pic"" that forgoes the melodramatic retelling of fact, and instead uses real life to make a statement, in this case about globalization.  Director Paul Greengrass (The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum), aims his ""shaky"" camera not only at the heroic protagonist, but also at what leads these Somali pirates to take such risky action.  By the time the pirates board Phillips' ship, we are thoroughly disturbed and authentically frightened for what they may be capable of doing to take over the vessel.  The four pirates are meticulously realized through some menacing bilingual performances by a group of first-time Somali actors.  As the film unfolds, their story and motivations are every bit as fascinating and gripping as those of Phillips and his crew.  Phillips' opening conversation with his wife about the stresses of competition and the vanishing opportunities for those less fortunate becomes realized as we see this despair front and center.Tom Hanks is sure to earn an Oscar nomination for his performance in this film.  In fact, this may be the performance of his career, certainly his best since Philadelphia.  His pragmatic performance is captivating, and he is never over-the-top.  In a scene where Muse, the lead pirate, invades the cargo ship's control room, Phillips squares off with the pirates for the first time.  Hanks responds to this scenario so well and so realistically that it is easy to forget that this is a movie and not real life.  As the film goes on, Hanks tempers his performance for every new development culminating in a scene towards the end that is nothing short of brilliant, heartbreaking, and stirring.Captain Phillips is another great movie for 2013.  While the story is still relatively current and many film-goers will be aware of its outcome, Greengrass, Hanks, and the supporting cast ensure a thrilling experience.  The film also works on a deeper level by examining the motives of the pirates and theorizing about some of the policies that should, perhaps, be revisited regarding freighter security measures and the ""acceptable"" risks that are taken for the sake of transporting goods overseas.  The film resonates with vivacity but Hanks' performance is the film's true strength.

1557168,A3PBLIJGRM4ZJW,B008JFUNKU,The Peripatetic Reader,"[9, 24]","This is a movie with cardboard characters in an incredulous plot. While this movie is based on real events taking place in 2009, it is pure Hollywood. It is presented in the most simple manner possible &#8212; Good against Evil. Therefore the story line presents the events as the story of the piracy of an American freighter captain portrayed by Tom Hanks (Good) overtaken by a group of Somali Pirates (Evil) led by supporting actor Barkhad Abdi. And like all simplistic over-generalized stories, Hanks is saved by intervention of the U.S. Navy Seals (Very  Good).There are the usual Hollywood stereotypes thrown in for good measure:&#8226; There is Najee, the main villain, Evil incarnate, worse than his boss.&#8226; There is Elmi, the nervous teenager, who constantly wants to go back to land and befriends Hanks as much as possible.&#8226; Then there is the Calvary to the rescue, featured in this film as the US Navy and Navy Seals.The Seals come in to save the day. They kill the Somali pirates and arrest the leader, who is now sitting in federal prison.The fact that this was the general course of events in the real incident is merely incidental. If this all sounds like thousands of Westerns we&#8217;ve all seen, you&#8217;re right. Instead of taking place in the wide West, it is in international waters off the Somali coast. There is no real suspense in the outcome, in part because we all know from recent events the outcome, but also because it is like a modern Western, a simple story with a happy ending.Reality is not so very simple. The subtext lurking behind the action is the desperate poverty existing in Somalia, which is touched upon ever so briefly early in the movie. This is not an excuse for piracy, but explains the desperation that drives these young people to rob. The producers want to tell a simple story in a simple way, and in this they have succeeded. The sheer number of five-star ratings for this movie is testament to the general public&#8217;s desire for an uncomplicated story, sparing the uncomfortable details, with a happy ending.Reality is also complicated. In real life, the crew members of the Maersk are suing Captain Phillips for negligence in federal court. Quoting directly from this complaint, which is readily available for review online, Captain Phillips:1. failed to heed official warnings regarding the presence of pirates in waters where the vessel sailed;2. failed to take evasive action to avoid the area where pirates were present and known to be actively attaching vessels and taking merchant vessels and their crews hostage;3. Intentionally sailed into waters where pirates were present and knowingly placed his crew in harm&#8217;s way;4. Intentionally and knowingly placed his crew in harm&#8217;s way for reasons of financial gain;5. Failed to provide a safe place in which to work;6. Failed to provide appropriate levels of security to protect the other members of the crew;7. Failed to establish appropriate policy and failed to promulgate and enforce reasonable rules and regulations for the performance of the work on the vessel in such a manner to provide for the safety of His crew and other members of the officers and crew in the performance of their duties;8. Failed to adequately inspect and insure the proper operation of the vessel, its appurtenances and equipment so as to eliminate the risk of injuries to their employees;9. Failed to provide the his crew with the proper training, assistance, manning, security, tools, and equipment for the performance of the work which he was obliged to do at the aforesaid time and place;10. Failed to adequately warn the his crew of the dangerous, unsafe and unseaworthy condition;11. Failed to provide a competent crew for the vessel;12.

1557170,A1Y2GZGBMICFG8,B008JFUNKU,The Separator,"[1, 2]","The best thing about Paul Greengrass&#8217; new action thriller Captain Phillips is that it is actually about Captain Phillips. No, this is not a joke.Phillips is an adept ship captain for the huge shipping conglomerate Maersk. He assumes his role aboard a freighter docked in Oman bound for Kenya, and this route is straight through the Gulf of Aden, past Somali, the most pirate infested piece of ocean in the world. I assume most viewers entering the theatre already know that this film is about pirates attacking a ship. The film does fulfill this expectation in the first act, but from there everything that happens is as unpredictable as is possible to be unpredictable.First of all, kudos to the trailer&#8217;s producers and marketers for selling this film as a conflict totally based upon on the hijacking of a ship. While this is the first major conflict of the film, it is not the only one. As the ship&#8217;s hijacking unfolds, and errors occur, whole tangential series of events and complications are created. Greengrass takes these tangents to a place we never could have expected, and all of a sudden we have an unexpected thrilling crisis of a film.Overall it&#8217;s a simple story, but it&#8217;s so creative in its originality and unfolding that I was on the edge of my seat the whole film. Since it&#8217;s based on a true story I guess Greengrass shouldn&#8217;t get all the credit. A lot of the credit must go to one the two scriptwriters, Richard Phillips. He adapted this script from the book that was based on true events.Second of all, there is a storyline involving the Somali&#8217;s and the world they come from. It was a great idea to include this. We are shown that Somali pirates are not just pure evil, but are in many ways forced into the acts of piracy they undertake. In a extremely revealing scene Phillips and Muse, the head pirate, reveal how higher levels of bureaucracy influences both their lives, they both have bosses they say.In a moment of cinematic excellence, Greengrass actually makes the viewer feel sympathy for Muse despite the fact that he is a maniacal, automatic weapon toting killer who hijacks ships. Sir Greengrass, very well done.There has been a concern over this film&#8217;s release though, and this raises the question that all art needs to consider: do the events of the film/artwork that declare themselves as true have an obligations to actually be true? Or can anyone declare anything and make into a work in itself?This though comes from media attacks on the real Captain Phillips. According to The Guardian, apparently Captain Phillips himself was not the hero he is portrayed as in the film.  He was a notoriously difficult captain to work for, and by sailing too close to Somalia some say he was the cause of the whole incident. Debate aside, very good film.9/10Having transvered this section on ocean myself I feel a particular attraction to hijacking movies, and so I had to compare the Captain Phillips to Tobias Lindholm&#8217;s 2012 feature A Hijacking. Lindholm&#8217;s film was fantastic but in Lindholm&#8217;s take the onboard antics of the pirates are the focus. The Somalis were portrayed as plot devices. They reminded me of the riverboat&#8217; crew &agrave; la Conrad&#8217;s Heart of Darkness; they were there to serve their purposes as savages, and that&#8217;s it. So Unlike Greengrass&#8217; portrayal, in A Hijacking we hate the pirates.No subtitles (expect Danish to English), no frills, no action sequences, no military, just pure, raw, compelling filmmaking, with the ship&#8217;s cook as the main character played brilliantly by Pilou Asbk. I was worried that Greengrass saw the Lindholm film, which was an indie film on a tight budget, and decided remake it as blockbuster. I can say with complete confidence that these are two completely different films with only two real things in common, Somali pirates and ship hijackings.A hijacking: Highly recommended!More at getthebonesaw.blogspot.com",4,"Much different than anticipated, and very well done",1388448000,"12 31, 2013",2013,3989,"['best', 'thing', 'Paul', 'Greengrass', '8217', 'new', 'action', 'thriller', 'Captain', 'Phillips', 'actually', 'about', 'Captain', 'Phillips', 'No', 'not', 'joke.Phillips', 'adept', 'ship', 'captain', 'huge', 'shipping', 'conglomerate', 'Maersk', 'role', 'freighter', 'docked', 'Oman', 'bound', 'Kenya', 'route', 'straight', 'Gulf', 'Aden', 'past', 'Somali', 'most', 'pirate', 'infested', 'piece', 'ocean', 'world', 'assume', 'most', 'viewers', 'entering', 'theatre', 'already', 'know', 'film', 'pirates', 'attacking', 'ship', 'film', 'fulfill', 'expectation', 'first', 'act', 'there', 'everything', 'as', 'unpredictable', 'possible', 'be', 'unpredictable.First', 'kudos', 'trailer', '8217', 'producers', 'marketers', 'selling', 'film', 'conflict', 'totally', 'based', 'upon', 'hijacking', 'ship', 'first', 'major', 'conflict', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'ship', '8217', 'hijacking', 'unfolds', 'errors', 'occur', 'whole', 'tangential', 'series', 'events', 'complications', 'are', 'created', 'Greengrass', 'tangents', 'place', 'never', 'could', 'have', 'expected', 'sudden', 'have', 'unexpected', 'thrilling', 'crisis', 'film.Overall', '8217', 's', 'simple', 'story', '8217', 'so', 'creative', 'originality', 'unfolding', 'was', 'edge', 'seat', 'whole', 'film', '8217', 's', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'guess', 'Greengrass', 'shouldn', '8217', 'get', 'credit', 'lot', 'credit', 'must', 'go', 'one', 'two', 'scriptwriters', 'Richard', 'Phillips', 'adapted', 'script', 'book', 'was', 'based', 'true', 'events.Second', 'storyline', 'involving', 'Somali', '8217', 's', 'world', 'come', 'was', 'great', 'idea', 'include', 'are', 'shown', 'Somali', 'pirates', 'are', 'not', 'just', 'pure', 'evil', 'are', 'many', 'ways', 'forced', 'acts', 'piracy', 'undertake', 'extremely', 'revealing', 'scene', 'Phillips', 'Muse', 'head', 'pirate', 'reveal', 'how', 'higher', 'levels', 'bureaucracy', 'influences', 'lives', 'have', 'bosses', 'say.In', 'moment', 'cinematic', 'excellence', 'Greengrass', 'actually', 'viewer', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'Muse', 'fact', 'maniacal', 'automatic', 'weapon', 'toting', 'killer', 'who', 'ships', 'Sir', 'Greengrass', 'very', 'well', 'done.There', 'been', 'concern', 'film', '8217', 's', 'release', 'question', 'art', 'consider', 'do', 'events', 'film/artwork', 'true', 'have', 'obligations', 'actually', 'be', 'true', 'can', 'anyone', 'declare', 'anything', 'make', 'work', 'media', 'attacks', 'real', 'Captain', 'Phillips', 'According', 'Guardian', 'apparently', 'Captain', 'Phillips', 'was', 'not', 'hero', 'portrayed', 'film', 'was', 'notoriously', 'difficult', 'captain', 'work', 'sailing', 'too', 'close', 'Somalia', 'say', 'was', 'cause', 'whole', 'incident', 'Debate', 'aside', 'very', 'good', 'film.9/10Having', 'transvered', 'section', 'ocean', 'feel', 'particular', 'attraction', 'hijacking', 'movies', 'so', 'had', 'compare', 'Captain', 'Phillips', 'Tobias', 'Lindholm', '8217', 's', '2012', 'feature', 'Hijacking', 'Lindholm', '8217', 'film', 'was', 'fantastic', 'Lindholm', '8217', 's', 'take', 'onboard', 'antics', 'pirates', 'are', 'focus', 'Somalis', 'were', 'portrayed', 'plot', 'devices', 'reminded', 'riverboat', '8217', 'crew', 'agrave', 'Conrad', '8217', 's', 'Heart', 'Darkness', 'were', 'there', 'serve', 'purposes', 'savages', '8217', 's', 'So', 'Greengrass', '8217', 'portrayal', 'A', 'Hijacking', 'hate', 'pirates.No', 'subtitles', 'expect', 'Danish', 'English', 'frills', 'action', 'sequences', 'military', 'just', 'pure', 'raw', 'compelling', 'filmmaking', 'ship', '8217', 's', 'cook', 'main', 'character', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Pilou', 'Asbk', 'was', 'worried', 'Greengrass', 'saw', 'Lindholm', 'film', 'was', 'indie', 'film', 'tight', 'budget', 'decided', 'remake', 'blockbuster', 'can', 'say', 'complete', 'confidence', 'are', 'two', 'completely', 'different', 'films', 'only', 'two', 'real', 'things', 'common', 'Somali', 'ship', 'hijackings.A', 'hijacking', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'More', 'getthebonesaw.blogspot.com']",N/A

1557178,A3LDFTSXU3UPBO,B008JFUNKU,Tim &#34;Timdiana&#34; Dunn,"[2, 4]","Film inspired by true events are a dime and a dozen; but every now and again, we have a movie that does a swell job at bringing the true story to the silver screen. The latest film to bring reality to the limelight is Captain Phillips: the story of the hostage situation of the Maersk Alabama in 2009. This adaption was courtesy of  the book A Captain's Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy SEALs, and Dangerous Days at Sea , which was written by Capt. Richard Phillips and Stephan Talty. With a star like Tom Hanks and director Paul Greengrass, Captain Phillips has been shaping itself into quite the movie; and now it has the reviews to back it up. Yet, is this thriller worthy of the true events and your time?As already stated, the movie follows the events of the hostage situation of the Maersk Alabama. The situation saw Captain Phillips and his crew dealing with Somalian Pirates only for the captain to be capture and the US Navy to get involved. Now imagine the tension and drama that made this situation and turn it into an action flick.Captain Phillips' story is one that is easy to get into. While I felt the first act was quickly paced, once the Maersk Alabama gets chased by the Pirates, the plot straighten itself out. The story plays out by looking at two perspective: Captain Phillip and Muse. While this element does not last long, it gave the film a form of depth and I think it helped in the long run. Nevertheless, Captain Phillips has a story tension that will have anyone interested.I can't say Tom Hanks gives the performance of his life as Captain Phillips; but it certainly one his best in a while. If anything the role is one of Tom Hanks' more physical ones. I was curious to see how Barkhad Abdi would fair as Muse. While his performance wasn't as impressive as I was hoping, it was still solid. The rest of the cast is their to be supporting, and nothing more. That might sound discrediting; but on the contrary, the cast still worked.The cinematography was a hit a miss for me. On one hand, I like the overall imagery. Unfortunately, I found that  the cinematography to be very distracting. The camera move so much that it became an eyesore for me. Granted, I understand why the camera was moving, but it was still obnoxious. Fortunately, what wasn't straining was the tension, and boy is this movie was exciting. From the chase of the Marersk Alabama to the film's climax, Captain Phillips is certain to have you on the edge of your seat.The one scene that stood  out to me was the chase of the Maresk Alabama. In fact the whole sequence of the Alabama vs Pirates was great. The scene was riddled with tension and didn't play like your average action film. I would also give props to the film's climax, but you know what is going to happening in that, so it wasn't as gripping. Still, the sequence is tense.Captain Phillips is a film worthy of its subject matter. While the cinematography can be difficult to deal with, the film is still gripping and has terrific performance from Tom Hanks. I can't say how close it is to the true story; but Captain Phillips makes for one exiting time at the movies.Also read the review here: [...]",4,"Very Tense, Very Real and Very Good",1381449600,"10 11, 2013",2013,3155,"['Film', 'inspired', 'true', 'events', 'are', 'dime', 'dozen', 'now', 'again', 'have', 'movie', 'swell', 'job', 'bringing', 'true', 'story', 'silver', 'screen', 'latest', 'film', 'bring', 'reality', 'limelight', 'Captain', 'Phillips', 'story', 'hostage', 'situation', 'Maersk', 'Alabama', '2009', 'adaption', 'was', 'courtesy', 'book', 'A', 'Captain', 'Duty', 'Somali', 'Pirates', 'Navy', 'SEALs', 'Dangerous', 'Days', 'Sea', 'was', 'written', 'Capt', 'Richard', 'Phillips', 'Stephan', 'Talty', 'star', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'director', 'Paul', 'Greengrass', 'Captain', 'Phillips', 'been', 'shaping', 'quite', 'movie', 'now', 'reviews', 'back', 'up', 'thriller', 'worthy', 'true', 'events', 'time', 'already', 'stated', 'movie', 'events', 'hostage', 'situation', 'Maersk', 'Alabama', 'situation', 'saw', 'Captain', 'Phillips', 'crew', 'dealing', 'Somalian', 'Pirates', 'only', 'captain', 'be', 'capture', 'US', 'Navy', 'get', 'involved', 'Now', 'imagine', 'tension', 'drama', 'made', 'situation', 'turn', 'action', 'flick.Captain', 'Phillips', 'story', 'one', 'easy', 'get', 'felt', 'first', 'act', 'was', 'quickly', 'paced', 'once', 'Maersk', 'Alabama', 'chased', 'Pirates', 'plot', 'straighten', 'out', 'story', 'out', 'looking', 'two', 'perspective', 'Captain', 'Phillip', 'Muse', 'element', 'not', 'last', 'long', 'gave', 'film', 'form', 'depth', 'think', 'helped', 'long', 'run', 'Nevertheless', 'Captain', 'Phillips', 'story', 'tension', 'will', 'have', 'anyone', 'interested.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'performance', 'life', 'Captain', 'Phillips', 'certainly', 'one', 'best', 'while', 'anything', 'role', 'one', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'more', 'physical', 'ones', 'was', 'curious', 'see', 'how', 'Barkhad', 'Abdi', 'would', 'fair', 'Muse', 'performance', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'impressive', 'was', 'hoping', 'was', 'still', 'solid', 'rest', 'cast', 'be', 'supporting', 'nothing', 'more', 'might', 'sound', 'discrediting', 'contrary', 'cast', 'still', 'worked.The', 'cinematography', 'was', 'hit', 'miss', 'one', 'hand', 'like', 'overall', 'imagery', 'Unfortunately', 'found', 'cinematography', 'be', 'very', 'distracting', 'camera', 'move', 'so', 'much', 'became', 'eyesore', 'Granted', 'understand', 'why', 'camera', 'was', 'moving', 'was', 'still', 'obnoxious', 'Fortunately', 'what', 'was', ""n't"", 'straining', 'was', 'tension', 'boy', 'movie', 'was', 'exciting', 'chase', 'Marersk', 'Alabama', 'film', 'climax', 'Captain', 'Phillips', 'certain', 'have', 'edge', 'seat.The', 'one', 'scene', 'stood', 'out', 'was', 'chase', 'Maresk', 'Alabama', 'fact', 'whole', 'sequence', 'Alabama', 'vs', 'Pirates', 'was', 'great', 'scene', 'was', 'riddled', 'tension', 'did', ""n't"", 'play', 'average', 'action', 'film', 'would', 'also', 'give', 'props', 'film', 'climax', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'happening', 'was', ""n't"", 'gripping', 'Still', 'sequence', 'tense.Captain', 'Phillips', 'film', 'worthy', 'subject', 'matter', 'cinematography', 'can', 'be', 'difficult', 'deal', 'film', 'still', 'gripping', 'terrific', 'performance', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'how', 'close', 'true', 'story', 'Captain', 'Phillips', 'one', 'exiting', 'time', 'movies.Also', 'read', 'review', 'here', '[', ']']",N/A

There are some clever attempts at defense (Phillips' making a false a call for help, knowing his radio is being monitored; his men placing broken glass for the barefooted pirates to step on), a few little ironies, such as the pirate's stating his ""love of the US"" as he threatens to kill Phillips to get one of his captured men back, and his wish to travel to the States coming above in the most ironic way possible.

When he boards a ship captained by Rich Phillips (Hanks) he thinks he found his answer to his problems, but things only get worse for all involved. This is a true story. It's always more fun to watch a movie that is also a true story and even better when you see one that you remember the events when it was happening. As far as the movie goes it starts off pretty slow but grows more and more tense as it goes on. As good an actor as Tom Hanks is I found myself thinking that this is really a part that many people could pull off. Then I watched the last 20 minutes and realized why they got Hanks. Much like the movie Apollo 13, when you watch a movie that you know how it ends but still end up shedding a tear it is because of great filmmmaking. This falls into that category. A movie that builds momentum the entire time. Starts off slow but by the end you are hoping for more. I liked it.

1557203,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B008JFUNKU,Turfseer,"[1, 1]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Rating: 3.5 out of 5.0'Captain Phillips' is British director Paul Greengrass' convincing recreation of the kidnapping and subsequent rescue of Merchant Marine Captain Richard Phillips by Somali pirates in 2009. Greengrass manages to make things quite believable by no sleight of hand. Firstly, he films most of the story on the high seas, utilizing a sister container ship, filling in for the Maersk Alabama, which four Somali pirates managed to board as it made its way to Mombassa, Kenya in the Indian Ocean.Greengrass employed three other successful strategies to give the film a heady verisimilitude. There is of course the casting of Tom Hanks as Captain Phillips, a no-nonsense New Englander, who heroically survived a brutal kidnapping. Hanks conveys Phillips' stoicism early on as he ensures that his crew practice drills to prepare themselves for any potential pirate incursions (notably Phillips dispenses with the stoic demeanor at the end of his ordeal and becomes very emotional--probably Hanks' best scene in the entire film). It should be noted that Phillips' crew in real-life, faulted their captain for sailing too close to the Somali coast, which they alleged, put them all at risk. But I believe Phillips' analysis when he comments early on in a meeting with the crew, that they could have been thousands of miles from the coast, and still could have been subject to attack.Greenbrass also utilizes the sister ship of the USS Bainbride, the Truxtun, along with most of the Navy crew, who also make the eventual rescue operation quite believable. Finally, the casting of the four Somali pirates, neophyte Somali-born actors, who moved to the US when they were young, and who Greengrass found after a casting call in Minneapolis, added greatly to the film's overall realism.The expository scene where Phillips says goodbye to his wife at the airport, goes on a tad bit too long but things are off and running when he arrives for duty as skipper on the Maersk Alabama in the port of Salalah in Oman. Greengrass then cuts to Somalia where the inciting incident occurs. The four pirates led by Muse (aka 'Skinny'), who eventually successfully board the Maersk and kidnap Phillips, along with another group of pirates, are beholden to a syndicate (headed by a warlord). While they are forced to do this gang's bidding, they don't go grudgingly, as engaging in such nefarious activities as a pirate is viewed as a 'badge of honor'.Once Phillips is on board the Maersk Alabama, we become privy to just how much knowledge is needed to run a container ship of that size. The first half of 'Captain Phillips' involves the attack and subsequent boarding of the ship by the pirates. As depicted (and as it happened during the actual event), the first attempt to board the ship was a failure. Phillips ends up bluffing one pirate group back to their mother ship after pretending that the American Navy is already on their way. The second group, headed by Muse, decides to try again, and using a ladder, manages this time to successfully board the Maersk. All this appears quite exciting on screen and in watching the Blu-ray extra documentary about the making of 'Captain Phillips' afterward, one must commend Mr. Greengrass for not only his technical expertise in filming the attack scenes but also directing actors who had no actual prior experience manning skiffs on the high seas.Most of the events depicted in 'Captain Phillips' actually happened but here and there, scenes are concocted for dramatic effect. I'm thinking particularly of the scene where the Maersk crew intentionally leave shards of broken glass near where they're hiding below deck, which leads to the injury of one of the pirates after he steps on the glass, cutting his foot.After Muse is captured by the Maersk crew and the exchange for Captain Phillips goes awry, the second half of the film begins. The scene inside the cramped lifeboat is perhaps the weakest. Greengrass attempts to establish the personal relationship that develops between Muse and Phillips with Muse claiming that Western companies destroyed their livelihood as fisherman by basically cleaning out the ocean's stock and Phillips rightfully maintaining that no way in the world, Muse and his unpleasant band, were fishermen. The pirates argue over a lack of the local narcotic khat and Phillips attempts to put a bandage on the injured foot of one of the pirates (again, an injury which did not happen during the actual event). There's little tension in the lifeboat scene and Greengrass probably should have compressed it, perhaps partially as a montage, utilizing the film's tension-producing score.Things pick up again with the arrival of the Bainbridge and the exciting sequence of events, leading to the rescue of Captain Phillips. Before three of the pirates are taken out by Navy marksmen and Muse is tricked into boarding the Bainbridge, to 'negotiate' a ransom, Hanks acquits himself quite nicely where he attempts to escape by diving off the lifeboat and swimming for his life. Greengrass doubles down on the suspense when the pirates tie Phillips up and put a gun to his head, right before they're dispensed with.Greengrass makes a big point of not being jingoistic after the seals take down three of the four pirate crew. Nonetheless, one cannot completely disagree with Andrew O'hehir, writing in Salon magazine, when he remarks that 'Captain Phillips', has the ""calm technological blankness of a Navy commercial, without the 1970s waka-waka guitar."" AS O'hehir sees it, there are ""billions of dollars of cutting-edge military hardware and hundreds of corn-fed, gym-toned Americans on one side, four malnourished men with black-market Kalashnikovs on the other.""Still, one can see no justification for piracy. The emotional impact on Phillips is evident in the great final scene as Phillips begins sobbing, as he's being treated by Navy medical personnel. It's a compelling ending to the suspense that comes before.",3,Suspenseful high sea rescue drama succeeds in spite of slight slowdown after the midpoint,1399161600,"05 4, 2014",2014,6020,"['***',

1557205,A13P6BK2DG60B6,B008JFUNKU,"T.W. ""TW""","[1, 2]","Stripped of the million dollar production gadgetry, I'm not sure why they made this movie, as presented. Yes, I know it's based on a true story, however, at its core this is nothing but a hostage negotiation stand-off movie. I've seen better stories within this genre on Law & Order SVU. The impressive production values and the pulse-riveting movie-score disguise the remnants of a narrative that was overdone 20 years ago. This movie - unintentionally - is about Samson and Galieth, the former being the pirates. Yes, a couple of young, uneducated and desperate thugs from Somalia have gotten themselves into a situation that's way over their heads. Tom Hanks tries VERY hard to make his captors appear as formidable adversaries but he never succeeds. Even in captivity, Hank's Captain Phillips is able to easily manipulate them. Later, the Somalians find themselves doing battle with the big-bad American Navy with their billion dollar military hardware. It's obvious even before the pirates overtake Captain Phillips' ship they are in over their heads, when their small ship breaks down during the first attempt to breach the ship. The pirates are angry, untrained, uneducated but armed - the latter unfortunately is their undoing. The pirates' fate is abundantly clear when the SEAL's arrive by parachute and by sea. The contrasting professionalism and might of the opposing forces, the American Navy versus the pirates, is so lopsided you can't help but feel sympathy for the pirates, as the audience knows what their fate is going to be. It's like watching an NFL team play a little-league football pee-wee team, to the death. Yes, I know pirates are thugs and criminals but they are also desperate. It's a desperation that will never be completely understood in the West. I would suspect President Obama blessed the SEAL's mission. If it hadn't been for this, I would say the narrative of Captain Phillips, as presented by the movie, borders on being a little racist. As a propaganda movie, Captain Phillips' narrative is designed as an attaboy for the military and is designed to show pirates or any other threat out there what to expect if they mess with Americans at sea. The pirates are desperate thugs and criminals but at least they don't make movies about their accomplishments.",2,Not Sure Why They Made This Movie,1394236800,"03 8, 2014",2014,2293,"['Stripped', 'million', 'dollar', 'production', 'gadgetry', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'made', 'movie', 'presented', 'Yes', 'know', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'however', 'core', 'nothing', 'hostage', 'negotiation', 'stand-off', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'better', 'stories', 'genre', 'Law', 'Order', 'SVU', 'impressive', 'production', 'values', 'pulse-riveting', 'movie-score', 'disguise', 'remnants', 'narrative', 'was', 'overdone', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'movie', 'unintentionally', 'Samson', 'Galieth', 'former', 'being', 'pirates', 'Yes', 'couple', 'young', 'uneducated', 'desperate', 'thugs', 'Somalia', 'have', 'gotten', 'situation', 'way', 'heads', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'VERY', 'hard', 'make', 'captors', 'appear', 'formidable', 'adversaries', 'never', 'Even', 'captivity', 'Hank', 'Captain', 'Phillips', 'able', 'easily', 'manipulate', 'Later', 'Somalians', 'find', 'doing', 'battle', 'big-bad', 'American', 'Navy', 'billion', 'dollar', 'military', 'hardware', 'obvious', 'even', 'pirates', 'overtake', 'Captain', 'Phillips', 'ship', 'are', 'heads', 'when', 'small', 'ship', 'breaks', 'down', 'first', 'attempt', 'breach', 'ship', 'pirates', 'are', 'angry', 'untrained', 'uneducated', 'armed', 'latter', 'unfortunately', 'undoing', 'pirates', 'fate', 'abundantly', 'clear', 'when', 'SEAL', 'arrive', 'parachute', 'sea', 'contrasting', 'professionalism', 'might', 'opposing', 'forces', 'American', 'Navy', 'pirates', 'so', 'lopsided', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'pirates', 'audience', 'what', 'fate', 'going', 'be', 'watching', 'NFL', 'team', 'play', 'little-league', 'football', 'pee-wee', 'team', 'death', 'Yes', 'know', 'pirates', 'are', 'thugs', 'criminals', 'are', 'also', 'desperate', 'desperation', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'completely', 'understood', 'West', 'would', 'suspect', 'President', 'Obama', 'blessed', 'SEAL', 'mission', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'would', 'say', 'narrative', 'Captain', 'Phillips', 'presented', 'movie', 'borders', 'being', 'little', 'racist', 'propaganda', 'movie', 'Captain', 'Phillips', 'narrative', 'designed', 'attaboy', 'military', 'designed', 'show', 'pirates', 'other', 'threat', 'there', 'what', 'expect', 'mess', 'Americans', 'sea', 'pirates', 'are', 'desperate', 'thugs', 'criminals', 'least', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'movies', 'accomplishments']",N/A

His performance in the last three minutes of the movie alone was oscar-worthy.  The performances by the actors portraying the &#34;pirates&#34; are exceptional as well.  I feared the movie might bore me at times, but Director Greengrass does a terrific job pacing every moment.  He builds a two plus hour movie to a terrific, suspenseful crescendo.  I really tried to find something to complain about this movie, but couldn't.  I have not had a chance to read the book by Captain Phillips so it may be that the filmmakers took a degree of poetic license to enhance the story, but from script, to dialogue, to acting to cinematography this borders on a perfect movie.  There are a few moments where some of the dialogue is not as clear as one might like, or action is difficult to see owing to low light, but I felt like those instances lent to the realism and effort to build tension and draw the audience in.

1557230,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B008JFUNKU,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[177, 199]","Paul Greengrass' Captain Phillips is the story of a 2009 incident that most people probably still remember, when a group of Somali pirates boarded an American cargo freighter, the Maersk Alabama, and after failing to gain control of the ship, took its captain, Richard Phillips, hostage, resulting in the US Navy mounting an intense rescue operation to recover Captain Phillips. Directed by Greengrass (United 93, The Bourne Ultimatum) from a script by Billy Ray (Breach, The Hunger Games) based on a book written by Phillips and Stephan Talty about the incident, Captain Phillips is a well-crafted, tense docu-drama that captures the intensity of the events as they played out, from the moment the Maersk Alabama first sees the approaching pirate crafts to the moment when Navy Seals make their assault, ending the situation with deadly finality and the successful rescue.More than anything else, the core of Captain Phillips is the contest of wills that takes place between Phillips (a finely nuanced performance by veteran Tom Hanks) and the pirate leader Muse (an amazingly intense performance by first-time actor Barkhad Abdi). Phillips is determined to do everything he can to keep the pirates from gaining control of the ship and to keep his crew from being captured and held hostage, while Muse is determined to succeed in achieving the pirates' version of the American dream, against all odds and no matter what risks he and his men must take. Hanks' Phillips is a man who desperately hangs on to his sense of calm in the face of mounting danger because he knows it's his - and his crew's - only path to safety. And survival. Abdi's Muse is more complex. On the one hand, he displays a relentless cunning and daring, combined with the ability to take the lead, that invites your unwilling admiration even as he engages in threats and brutality to gain and keep control of the situation. But at the same time, he shows an incredible naivety about just what he is doing, not thinking beyond securing his catch of the day. At one point he tells an astonished Phillips of his plan to go to America with the money he'll get from the ransom and buy a car. There is also a certain hubris about Muse that makes his character at least pitiable if not actually sympathetic as things begin to go wrong and he feels his control - and his chances for his big score - rapidly slipping away from him. This is most particularly brought home in the form of an increasingly unstable pirate named Najee (Faysal Ahmed) whom Muse had hand-picked for the operation but who now is threatening to kill their hostage.The musical score by Henry Jackman (X-Men: First Class, Kick-Ass) is very well done, adding to the sense of rising tension without distracting from what is happening on the screen. And in addition to the music, Greengrass makes excellent use of sound, particularly the sounds of a ship gone dead in the water, creating a sense of an alien space that the pirates have invaded when they go searching for the crew, each random creak and clang breaking the silence wearing at the pirates' khat-frayed nerves. (Note: khat is a plant native to the region whose leaves, when chewed, act as an amphetamine-like stimulant, and all of the pirates are seen chewing khat since the operation began).Highly, highly recommended for anyone who enjoys a taut thriller that will keep your attention  gripped to the screen for its entire 134 minutes.",5,"A well-crafted, tense docu-drama centered around a clash of wills",1381622400,"10 13, 2013",2013,3432,"['Paul', 'Greengrass', 'Captain', 'Phillips', 'story', '2009', 'incident', 'most', 'people', 'probably', 'still', 'remember', 'when', 'group', 'Somali', 'pirates', 'boarded', 'American', 'cargo', 'freighter', 'Maersk', 'Alabama', 'failing', 'gain', 'control', 'ship', 'took', 'captain', 'Richard', 'Phillips', 'hostage', 'resulting', 'US', 'Navy', 'mounting', 'intense', 'rescue', 'operation', 'recover', 'Captain', 'Phillips', 'Directed', 'Greengrass', 'United', '93', 'Bourne', 'Ultimatum', 'script', 'Billy', 'Ray', 'Breach', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'based', 'book', 'written', 'Phillips', 'Stephan', 'Talty', 'incident', 'Captain', 'Phillips', 'well-crafted', 'tense', 'docu-drama', 'intensity', 'events', 'played', 'out', 'moment', 'Maersk', 'Alabama', 'first', 'approaching', 'pirate', 'crafts', 'moment', 'when', 'Navy', 'Seals', 'make', 'assault', 'ending', 'situation', 'deadly', 'finality', 'successful', 'rescue.More', 'anything', 'else', 'core', 'Captain', 'Phillips', 'contest', 'wills', 'place', 'Phillips', 'finely', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'veteran', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'pirate', 'leader', 'Muse', 'amazingly', 'intense', 'performance', 'first-time', 'actor', 'Barkhad', 'Abdi', 'Phillips', 'determined', 'do', 'everything', 'can', 'keep', 'pirates', 'gaining', 'control', 'ship', 'keep', 'crew', 'being', 'captured', 'held', 'hostage', 'Muse', 'determined', 'succeed', 'achieving', 'pirates', 'version', 'American', 'dream', 'odds', 'matter', 'what', 'men', 'must', 'take', 'Hanks', 'Phillips', 'man', 'who', 'desperately', 'sense', 'calm', 'face', 'mounting', 'danger', 'crew', 'only', 'path', 'safety', 'survival', 'Abdi', 'Muse', 'more', 'complex', 'one', 'hand', 'relentless', 'cunning', 'daring', 'combined', 'ability', 'take', 'lead', 'unwilling', 'admiration', 'even', 'threats', 'brutality', 'gain', 'keep', 'control', 'situation', 'same', 'time', 'incredible', 'naivety', 'about', 'just', 'what', 'doing', 'not', 'thinking', 'securing', 'catch', 'day', 'one', 'point', 'astonished', 'Phillips', 'plan', 'go', 'America', 'money', ""'ll"", 'get', 'ransom', 'buy', 'car', 'also', 'certain', 'hubris', 'Muse', 'character', 'least', 'pitiable', 'not', 'actually', 'sympathetic', 'things', 'begin', 'go', 'wrong', 'control', 'chances', 'big', 'score', 'rapidly', 'slipping', 'away', 'most', 'particularly', 'brought', 'home', 'form', 'increasingly', 'unstable', 'pirate', 'named', 'Najee', 'Faysal', 'Ahmed', 'whom', 'Muse', 'had', 'hand-picked', 'operation', 'who', 'now', 'threatening', 'kill', 'hostage.The', 'musical', 'score', 'Henry', 'Jackman', 'X-Men', 'First', 'Class', 'Kick-Ass', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'adding', 'sense', 'rising', 'tension', 'distracting', 'what', 'happening', 'screen', 'addition', 'music', 'Greengrass', 'excellent', 'use', 'sound', 'particularly', 'sounds', 'ship', 'gone', 'dead', 'water', 'creating', 'sense', 'alien', 'space', 'pirates', 'have', 'invaded', 'when', 'go', 'searching', 'crew', 'random', 'creak', 'clang', 'breaking', 'silence', 'wearing', 'pirates', 'khat-frayed', 'nerves', 'Note', 'khat', 'plant', 'native', 'region', 'leaves', 'when', 'chewed', 'act', 'amphetamine-like', 'stimulant', 'pirates', 'are', 'seen', 'chewing', 'khat', 'operation', 'began', '.Highly', 'highly', 'recommended', 'anyone', 'who', 'taut', 'thriller', 'will', 'keep', 'attention', 'gripped', 'screen', 'entire', '134', 'minutes']",N/A

To me, however, the hallmark of the movie was its ability to make viewers ask themselves the question &#34;what would I do in a similar scenario?&#34;.For a basic plot summary, &#34;Captain Phillips&#34; tells the story of Rich Phillips (Tom Hanks), captain of a shipping vessel that is boarded by a gang of Somali pirates led by Muse (Barkhad Abi).  Looking to strike a a huge payday from an American ship, the pirates take Mr. Phillips as their hostage.  However, despite their best efforts, the pirates are constantly set back by the ingenuity and courage of Phillips and his crew.The most striking experience of this whole film to me was this: Here we are in the year 2014, and we are still dealing with pirates!  When people use that word nowadays, they are mostly referring to fictional characters with eye-patches flying the Jolly Roger skull-and-crossbones.  The Somali pirates, though, are not of this variety.  They are both ruthless and calculating, producing a visceral sense of fear that they could begin taking lives at any time.Thus, while watching the movie, I was constantly thinking &#34;how would I handle this situation?&#34;.  At the same time, I was amazed by the ingenuity and courage of Phillips in the face of a very, very frightening situation.  Being based on a true story (although I honestly know nothing about the real Captain Phillips, so I can't vouch for accuracy whatsoever), this movie has a sense of &#34;real-world gravitas&#34; to it, while at the same time producing incredibly high drama due to the unique situations it presents.As far as the acting is concerned, &#34;Captain Phillips&#34; showcases some of the best.  The tension between the Hanks and Abdi characters is palpable throughout, while the final few minutes of the film may be the best work Mr. Hanks has ever put up on the big screen (and what a statement that is!).Overall, then, &#34;Captain Phillips&#34; is the film I would vote as &#34;Best Picture&#34; at the 2014 Academy Awards.  It is a film that can be enjoyed by all, not just appealing to a particular segment.  Even if you &#34;know what is going to happen&#34;, so to speak (being based on a real person's experiences), the tension between Phillips and the Pirates will still have you on the edge of your seat.",5,What If It Happened To You?,1391299200,"02 2, 2014",2014,2476,"['are', 'many', 'unique', 'aspects', 'make', '34', 'Captain', 'Phillips', '34', 'Best', 'Picture-nominee', 'incredible', 'acting', 'high', 'tension', 'plot', 'one', 'would', ""n't"", 'think', 'could', 'occur', 'yet', '21st', 'century', 'however', 'hallmark', 'movie', 'was', 'ability', 'make', 'viewers', 'ask', 'question', '34', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'similar', 'scenario', '34', '.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', '34', 'Captain', 'Phillips', '34', 'story', 'Rich', 'Phillips', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'captain', 'shipping', 'vessel', 'boarded', 'gang', 'Somali', 'pirates', 'led', 'Muse', 'Barkhad', 'Abi', 'Looking', 'strike', 'huge', 'payday', 'American', 'ship', 'pirates', 'take', 'Mr.', 'Phillips', 'hostage', 'However', 'best', 'efforts', 'pirates', 'are', 'constantly', 'set', 'back', 'ingenuity', 'courage', 'Phillips', 'crew.The', 'most', 'striking', 'experience', 'whole', 'film', 'was', 'Here', 'are', 'year', '2014', 'are', 'still', 'dealing', 'pirates', 'When', 'people', 'use', 'word', 'nowadays', 'are', 'mostly', 'referring', 'fictional', 'characters', 'eye-patches', 'flying', 'Jolly', 'Roger', 'skull-and-crossbones', 'Somali', 'pirates', 'are', 'not', 'variety', 'are', 'ruthless', 'calculating', 'producing', 'visceral', 'sense', 'fear', 'could', 'begin', 'taking', 'lives', 'time.Thus', 'watching', 'movie', 'was', 'constantly', 'thinking', '34', 'how', 'would', 'handle', 'situation', '34', 'same', 'time', 'was', 'amazed', 'ingenuity', 'courage', 'Phillips', 'face', 'very', 'very', 'frightening', 'situation', 'Being', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'honestly', 'know', 'nothing', 'real', 'Captain', 'Phillips', 'ca', ""n't"", 'vouch', 'accuracy', 'whatsoever', 'movie', 'sense', '34', 'real-world', 'gravitas', '34', 'same', 'time', 'producing', 'incredibly', 'high', 'drama', 'due', 'unique', 'situations', 'presents.As', 'far', 'acting', 'concerned', '34', 'Captain', 'Phillips', '34', 'best', 'tension', 'Hanks', 'Abdi', 'characters', 'palpable', 'final', 'few', 'minutes', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'work', 'Mr.', 'Hanks', 'ever', 'put', 'up', 'big', 'screen', 'what', 'statement', '.Overall', 'then', '34', 'Captain', 'Phillips', '34', 'film', 'would', 'vote', '34', 'Best', 'Picture', '34', '2014', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'not', 'just', 'appealing', 'particular', 'segment', 'Even', '34', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'happen', '34', 'speak', 'being', 'based', 'real', 'person', 'experiences', 'tension', 'Phillips', 'Pirates', 'will', 'still', 'have', 'edge', 'seat']",N/A
