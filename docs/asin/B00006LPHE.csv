720972,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00006LPHE,Grady Harp,"[8, 8]","'Torz&oacute;k' ('Abandoned') is a brilliant Hungarian film written and directed by &Aacute;rp&aacute;d Sopsits that takes us back to Hungary of 1960 when the oppressive Communist rule altered the lives of everyone, especially children.  The quality of the film is absolutely first rate from story to acting to filming to scoring.  It may be a tough film to absorb and certainly not for the easily offended, but it is a perfectly honed gem of a film that deserves wide audience exposure.&Aacute;ron (Tam&aacute;s M&eacute;sz&aacute;ros) is a young lad whose life seems warm at first until suddenly a disease of vision impairment attacks his mother and his parents divorce: the mother is somewhere in a hospital and the father (S&aacute;ndor G&aacute;sp&aacute;r) beats the boy and eventually turns him over to a rigid orphanage for boys run by cruel taskmasters.  &Aacute;ron undergoes initiation tactics by his fellow orphans but despite the beatings he is strong enough to survive.  He is befriended when he has his nightmares about his mother's blindness by his friend Atilla (Szabolcs Csizmadia) and the two bond emotionally and physically. In this bleak atmosphere a little light comes from the beautiful young housekeeper Anya (Krisztina Somogyi) but even her contributions are compromised by the cruelty of the staff.  There is one 'teacher' in the orphanage school, Nyitrai (L&aacute;szl&oacute; G&aacute;lffi) who has been reduced to his position as an 'imprisoned one' by the government and his sadness is offset by his playing his cello and studying his beloved astronomy. Nyitrai offers  &Aacute;ron solace and introduces his 'fellow traveler' to the glory of the stars, giving &Aacute;ron a map of the heavens that &Aacute;ron cherishes - his window to a world beyond the dark confines of his prison-like orphanage.  He gradually wins over his fellow orphans and when Nyitrai, in the pit of depression for his life situation and the cruelty of the orphanage and the government, hangs himself. This horrid incident drives &Aacute;ron to organize an escape from the orphanage, an event that is ultimately fractured with a death for which &Aacute;ron feels responsible. And the end of the film fades into the many possibilities that event could trigger.The atmosphere created by the stunning cinematography by P&eacute;ter Szatm&aacute;ri defines the darkness that represents the orphanage well but also suggests the darkness in Hungary of that period.  The musical score by P&eacute;ter Fejcsik, Tam&aacute;s G&ouml;rg&eacute;nyi, Ferenc Toma, and Bal&aacute;zs Winkler is some of the most beautiful composed for the screen, making tremendously effective use of the cello and lower strings.  In all, this is a brilliant piece of filmmaking, acted with depth in every role, and unveiling a portion of history and tragedy too often pushed to the background of our books.  Highly Recommended.

720973,A3EPH0HLPI98T3,B00006LPHE,Jakey,"[15, 15]","Like many in America, I'm one who enjoys venturing away from the all-too-common Hollywood films that are filled with flashy violence, gangs, killings, (mostly done with special effects).... and of course an unending supply of four letter words in nearly every situation imaginable.Yet foreign films often tend to derive their impact more from a sense of 'realism', and that is precisely what this film ""Abandoned"" (""Torzok"") does.Most of us would like to believe that a Hungarian orphanage such as the one depicted in this film could never exist.  But they have.... and likely still do.Some of the scenes I've read about in other reviews of this film have often been referred to as sexual, and I hardly see this as such.  Most of us cannot begin to imagine what it must be like.... as a very small child being tossed into a world of sheer abandonment from any sense of security or love from family.  But that is precisely what these children represent.... and a kiss between two little boys who share a bed after one has had a horrendous nightmare - - I can hardly imagine why one would consider this sexual.There are many chilling scenes in this film.... most notably the whipping of one boy by other boys (against their will).I was also deeply disturbed by the way the orphanage leader lied to the blonde-haired youngster, by bribing him with a lie about the child's brother.  This is something I've reflected back upon with this film, and it bothered me as much, if not more than the physical abuse we see.  Because as devastating as physical abuse may be.... nothing can compare to destroying the trust of a child in a moment of utter despair and vulnerability, (not only was the boy naked, he needed a reason at that very moment to believe and to have hope), and this trust is literally shattered with a false promise.After renting this dvd, I have hesitated to purchase this film... because of the haunting effect it has on our inner-being.  It forces me to wonder why one child in this world is fortunate - - - and another's fate is doomed before he's even given a chance to truly live.  Perhaps I feel guilt in being one of the ""fortunate"" ones.",5,Powerful and impactful.,1123632000,"08 10, 2005",2005,2153,"['many', 'America', ""'m"", 'one', 'who', 'venturing', 'away', 'all-too-common', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'are', 'filled', 'flashy', 'violence', 'gangs', 'killings', 'mostly', 'done', 'special', 'effects', 'course', 'unending', 'supply', 'four', 'letter', 'words', 'nearly', 'situation', 'foreign', 'films', 'often', 'tend', 'derive', 'impact', 'more', 'sense', ""'realism"", 'precisely', 'what', 'film', 'Abandoned', 'Torzok', 'does.Most', 'would', 'like', 'believe', 'Hungarian', 'orphanage', 'such', 'one', 'depicted', 'film', 'could', 'never', 'exist', 'have', 'likely', 'still', 'do.Some', 'scenes', ""'ve"", 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'film', 'have', 'often', 'been', 'referred', 'sexual', 'hardly', 'see', 'such', 'Most', 'can', 'not', 'begin', 'imagine', 'what', 'must', 'be', 'very', 'small', 'child', 'being', 'tossed', 'world', 'sheer', 'abandonment', 'sense', 'security', 'love', 'family', 'precisely', 'what', 'children', 'represent', 'kiss', 'two', 'little', 'boys', 'who', 'share', 'bed', 'one', 'had', 'horrendous', 'nightmare', 'can', 'hardly', 'imagine', 'why', 'one', 'would', 'consider', 'sexual.There', 'are', 'many', 'chilling', 'scenes', 'film', 'most', 'notably', 'whipping', 'one', 'boy', 'other', 'boys', 'will', '.I', 'was', 'also', 'deeply', 'disturbed', 'way', 'orphanage', 'leader', 'lied', 'blonde-haired', 'youngster', 'bribing', 'lie', 'child', 'brother', 'something', ""'ve"", 'reflected', 'back', 'film', 'bothered', 'much', 'not', 'more', 'physical', 'abuse', 'see', 'as', 'devastating', 'physical', 'abuse', 'may', 'be', 'nothing', 'can', 'compare', 'destroying', 'trust', 'child', 'moment', 'utter', 'despair', 'vulnerability', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'boy', 'naked', 'needed', 'reason', 'very', 'moment', 'believe', 'have', 'hope', 'trust', 'literally', 'shattered', 'false', 'promise.After', 'renting', 'dvd', 'have', 'hesitated', 'purchase', 'film', 'haunting', 'effect', 'inner-being', 'wonder', 'why', 'one', 'child', 'world', 'fortunate', 'fate', 'doomed', 'even', 'given', 'chance', 'truly', 'live', 'Perhaps', 'feel', 'guilt', 'being', 'one', 'fortunate', 'ones']",Abandoned

Where I'm having ambivalent feelings is in the acting, directing, and storyline.  The acting of the main charactor apperars too directed thus detacheded true emotions.  I'm not blaming this on the actor as he is very young, thus, inexperienced in real life sceneros that require similair situations to draw upon when asking to reenact.  There are too many instances where he is performing out of duty and not fully aware of the emotional impact the particular scene requires.  Too many ""adult"" situations that kids are being directed to act in but with out full understanding of what they mean lessens the impact in film.The little boy who prays outloud evey night was the exception to the rule (kids being abused DO pray for safety). The adults who work at the school and have difference with the strict authortive nature of the headmaster also seem weak which, in my opinion weakens the film (as adults, they don't have a backbone).
