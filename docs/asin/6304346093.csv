Griffiths ""Adrian""","[4, 10]","Ok, a lot of reviewers seem to love this film, and I must say I enjoyed watching it too...but only due to the constant jaw-dropping horror and surprise I experienced during this unfathomable exercise in ""entertainment.""The plot...well, simply it doesn't matter. Suffice to say that Mae West must be well over 80, but she plays a Hollywood sex bomb who has just married for the 6th time. She is greeted by a level of hysteria on arrival in London that rivals the second coming (albeit on a budget). Her new husband is a young Timothy Dalton, long before his James Bond years. The married couple book into a posh London hotel and there are plenty of ""laughs"" to follow as their planned night of wedded bliss is constantly interrupted by various capers and intruding ex husbands. My reaction to this was...""Thank God for that""! The notion of an 80+ year old woman fighting off the attention of all these 30 something young suitors is plain ridiculous. Its sooo obvious that Mae (game though she is throughout) is simply way too old to make this role believeable. She can barely walk, and her acting consists of little more than creaking around in tight, figure hugging gowns and feathers (mmm...), patting her platinum curls and reading out vulgar double-entendres in answer to any query from a male member of the cast. I don't think she had a single line in the whole film that a) wasn't dirty, and b) contributed something to the plot!If you can suspend your disbelief about this situation long enough to concentrate on the rest of the film, you'll be blown away by the sheer ineptitude of it, not least of all the musical numbers. At one point, all the staff and guests in Mae's London hotel lobby suddenly break into ""Hooray For Hollywood"" as she checks in...so wrong, and for so many reasons! Then later, Mae and Dalton enjoy a (barely) sung duet of ""Love Will Keep Us Together"", and there are many more just as bad. Mae has a few brief solo numbers of her own, and its obvious that she didn't have the energy (or the voice) to pull them off, but they are here all the same. Its all so pitiful and there isn't a shred of irony about it. Some reviewers say the film is tongue in cheek, and is not taking itself seriously. I disagree. The film is obviously intended to be a tribute to the curvaceous charms of its star..it's just 40 years too late! But I'm glad, because the amount of laughs you'll get from watching it are doubled for this very reason. There are loads more howlers that I don't have the space to even go into, but nothing matches the bare-faced inappropriateness of the central issue. So do Mae and Tim ever get it together for a night of passion...? If the idea doesn't turn your stomach, get this DVD and find out!",3,"File under ""What Were They Thinking?""",1083024000,"04 27, 2004",2004,2734,"['Ok', 'lot', 'reviewers', 'seem', 'love', 'film', 'must', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'too', 'only', 'due', 'constant', 'jaw-dropping', 'horror', 'surprise', 'experienced', 'unfathomable', 'exercise', 'entertainment', 'plot', 'well', 'simply', ""n't"", 'matter', 'Suffice', 'say', 'Mae', 'West', 'must', 'be', 'well', '80', 'Hollywood', 'sex', 'bomb', 'who', 'just', 'married', '6th', 'time', 'greeted', 'level', 'hysteria', 'arrival', 'London', 'second', 'coming', 'budget', 'new', 'husband', 'young', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'long', 'James', 'Bond', 'years', 'married', 'couple', 'book', 'posh', 'London', 'hotel', 'are', 'plenty', 'laughs', 'follow', 'planned', 'night', 'wedded', 'bliss', 'constantly', 'interrupted', 'various', 'capers', 'intruding', 'ex', 'husbands', 'reaction', 'was', 'Thank', 'God', 'notion', '80+', 'year', 'old', 'woman', 'fighting', 'off', 'attention', '30', 'something', 'young', 'suitors', 'plain', 'ridiculous', 'sooo', 'obvious', 'Mae', 'game', 'simply', 'way', 'too', 'old', 'make', 'role', 'believeable', 'can', 'barely', 'walk', 'acting', 'consists', 'little', 'more', 'creaking', 'around', 'tight', 'figure', 'hugging', 'gowns', 'feathers', 'mmm', 'patting', 'platinum', 'curls', 'reading', 'out', 'vulgar', 'double-entendres', 'answer', 'query', 'male', 'member', 'cast', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'had', 'single', 'line', 'whole', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'dirty', 'b', 'contributed', 'something', 'plot', 'can', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'situation', 'long', 'enough', 'concentrate', 'rest', 'film', ""'ll"", 'be', 'blown', 'away', 'sheer', 'ineptitude', 'not', 'least', 'musical', 'numbers', 'one', 'point', 'staff', 'guests', 'Mae', 'London', 'hotel', 'lobby', 'suddenly', 'break', 'Hooray', 'Hollywood', 'so', 'wrong', 'so', 'many', 'reasons', 'Then', 'later', 'Mae', 'Dalton', 'enjoy', 'barely', 'sung', 'duet', 'Love', 'Will', 'Keep', 'Us', 'Together', 'are', 'many', 'more', 'just', 'bad', 'Mae', 'few', 'brief', 'solo', 'numbers', 'own', 'obvious', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'energy', 'voice', 'pull', 'off', 'are', 'here', 'same', 'so', 'pitiful', ""n't"", 'shred', 'irony', 'reviewers', 'say', 'film', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'not', 'taking', 'seriously', 'disagree', 'film', 'obviously', 'intended', 'be', 'tribute', 'curvaceous', 'charms', 'star..it', 'just', '40', 'years', 'too', 'late', ""'m"", 'glad', 'amount', 'laughs', ""'ll"", 'get', 'watching', 'are', 'doubled', 'very', 'reason', 'are', 'loads', 'more', 'howlers', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'space', 'even', 'go', 'nothing', 'bare-faced', 'inappropriateness', 'central', 'issue', 'So', 'do', 'Mae', 'Tim', 'ever', 'get', 'together', 'night', 'passion', 'idea', ""n't"", 'turn', 'stomach', 'get', 'DVD', 'find', 'out']",Sextette VHS
415999,A2EOFYRFB292KS,6304346093,"Alberto M. Barral ""NY LuxViewer""","[1, 1]","This movie can only be appreciated as the true masterpiece of camp it undoubtedly is.Mae West is delightful. True courage was needed to impersonate the courtesan character that was her trademark, at the age she did, and still get away with stealing the show. For all the other stars that are here are just background for Mae's antics and famous one-liners.My favorite scene in the movie is when she is trying out an entire new wardrobe for a new movie, each gown more lavish, exagerated and madder in design than the last, and in the midst of it she caresses a mink coat and says ""If you want to catch a fox you have to get up early in the morning, but you've got to stay up late to get a mink"", so true to form and fabulous.The movie was intended as a camp fest, and it is! There are wonderful musical numbers with dancing hotel attendants that are a wonderful record of gay chorus line dancing of the seventies. The Gym scene is also a wonderful record of early steroid treatments, post-liberation gay body aesthetics and the adaptation of the Farah Fawcett hairdo to men styles, a phenomenon of kitsch that has not been studied properly, as the influence of Fawcett into new frontiers of the ridiculous and tacky has not been explored as  it deserves. We really need an extensive documentary just to make sense of that hair style and how it is connected with women's hair loss in the 80's and 90'sFor those who complain about the film's quality: I actually found this film to be uncannily avant-garde: It points to the future of Hollywood which is now our present, where this quality/style of directing, vapid, meaningless dialogue, and the ridiculousness of the situations is now the rule rather than the exception, but most often without any comic relief. In other words, we have been seeing variations of this movie for the last 30 years, usually starring an anorexic blonde without any of the sexiness, pizzaz or style of Mae West and certainly without that extra push towards the outer realms of true camp that Mae West can give this one.There is also one other area, overlooked by all reviewers here, where this movie is totally ahead of its time: Mae West looks far younger than her 85 years, and her weight proportions are pretty much the same as when she was younger,  but the women her age nowdays ALL over America have this look now. The restorations of plastic surgery, the implants of botox and other substances have finally accomplished an entire population that looks like she does in this movie. We can all recognize her slightly Chinese eyes, her intensely dyed hair and reconstructed cheek bones and mouth from  the women who lunch in New York, in other words she was the archetype of a new race of women between 40 and death that has taken over the national landscape and is rapidly becoming the standard rather than the exception. From this perspective Mae west can be studied as an anthropological phenomenon that has helped form a new ""improved"" image of women and feminine beauty with no expiration date in sight. Some of the latest samples of this scientifically improved beauty can be examined every morning amongst the anchorwomen in tv channels all over the country, sporting these features on an even younger generation, but with the additional bigger, whiter teeth that are a trademark of our time.A must-see for Mae West fans, but also for all those involved in theater and movie costumes and design, scholars of camp aesthetics, visual culture, plastic surgery and body modification.",5,Absolute Masterpiece of Camp,1263168000,"01 11, 2010",2010,3517,"['movie', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'appreciated', 'true', 'masterpiece', 'camp', 'undoubtedly', 'is.Mae', 'West', 'delightful', 'True', 'courage', 'was', 'needed', 'impersonate', 'courtesan', 'character', 'was', 'trademark', 'age', 'did', 'still', 'get', 'away', 'stealing', 'show', 'other', 'stars', 'are', 'here', 'are', 'just', 'background', 'Mae', 'antics', 'famous', 'one-liners.My', 'favorite', 'scene', 'movie', 'when', 'trying', 'out', 'entire', 'new', 'wardrobe', 'new', 'movie', 'gown', 'more', 'lavish', 'exagerated', 'madder', 'design', 'last', 'midst', 'mink', 'coat', 'want', 'catch', 'fox', 'have', 'get', 'up', 'early', 'morning', ""'ve"", 'got', 'stay', 'up', 'late', 'get', 'mink', 'so', 'true', 'form', 'fabulous.The', 'movie', 'was', 'intended', 'camp', 'fest', 'are', 'wonderful', 'musical', 'numbers', 'dancing', 'hotel', 'attendants', 'are', 'wonderful', 'record', 'gay', 'chorus', 'line', 'dancing', 'seventies', 'Gym', 'scene', 'also', 'wonderful', 'record', 'early', 'steroid', 'treatments', 'post-liberation', 'gay', 'body', 'aesthetics', 'adaptation', 'Farah', 'Fawcett', 'hairdo', 'men', 'styles', 'phenomenon', 'kitsch', 'not', 'been', 'studied', 'properly', 'influence', 'Fawcett', 'new', 'frontiers', 'ridiculous', 'tacky', 'not', 'been', 'explored', 'really', 'need', 'extensive', 'documentary', 'just', 'make', 'sense', 'hair', 'style', 'how', 'connected', 'women', 'hair', 'loss', '80', ""90'sFor"", 'who', 'complain', 'film', 'quality', 'actually', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'uncannily', 'avant-garde', 'future', 'Hollywood', 'now', 'present', 'where', 'quality/style', 'directing', 'vapid', 'meaningless', 'dialogue', 'ridiculousness', 'situations', 'now', 'rule', 'rather', 'exception', 'most', 'often', 'comic', 'relief', 'other', 'words', 'have', 'been', 'seeing', 'variations', 'movie', 'last', '30', 'years', 'usually', 'starring', 'anorexic', 'blonde', 'sexiness', 'pizzaz', 'style', 'Mae', 'West', 'certainly', 'extra', 'push', 'outer', 'realms', 'true', 'camp', 'Mae', 'West', 'can', 'give', 'one.There', 'also', 'one', 'other', 'area', 'overlooked', 'reviewers', 'here', 'where', 'movie', 'totally', 'ahead', 'time', 'Mae', 'West', 'far', 'younger', '85', 'years', 'weight', 'proportions', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'women', 'age', 'ALL', 'America', 'have', 'look', 'now', 'restorations', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'implants', 'botox', 'other', 'substances', 'have', 'finally', 'accomplished', 'entire', 'population', 'movie', 'can', 'recognize', 'slightly', 'Chinese', 'eyes', 'intensely', 'dyed', 'hair', 'reconstructed', 'cheek', 'bones', 'mouth', 'women', 'who', 'lunch', 'New', 'York', 'other', 'words', 'was', 'archetype', 'new', 'race', 'women', '40', 'death', 'taken', 'over', 'national', 'landscape', 'rapidly', 'becoming', 'standard', 'rather', 'exception', 'perspective', 'Mae', 'west', 'can', 'be', 'studied', 'anthropological', 'phenomenon', 'helped', 'form', 'new', 'improved', 'image', 'women', 'feminine', 'beauty', 'expiration', 'date', 'sight', 'latest', 'samples', 'scientifically', 'improved', 'beauty', 'can', 'be', 'examined', 'morning', 'anchorwomen', 'tv', 'channels', 'country', 'sporting', 'features', 'even', 'younger', 'generation', 'additional', 'bigger', 'whiter', 'are', 'trademark', 'time.A', 'must-see', 'Mae', 'West', 'fans', 'also', 'involved', 'theater', 'movie', 'costumes', 'design', 'scholars', 'camp', 'aesthetics', 'visual', 'culture', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'body', 'modification']",Sextette VHS

Legendary movies that are total classics make Mae one of the greatest ever top female Superstars...in her 80's Mae West once again treated us to a view of the legend and many found pleasure in this fun movie that once again gives us a chance to have a view of the classic and very legendary Mae West!  God forbid anyone or any of us age...Mae was never conventional having started her motion picture career in her forties and continued the following decades doing various stage and recording projects so it wasn't surprising that Mae West would do yet another motion picture once again in her eigthies!!! Mae was still very entertaining and had the thrill of going to the preview of this delightful movie in 1978 in Westwood California & had a strong feeling Mae West would attend. A line formed & arriving early we were the red velvet ropes and soon a red carpet rolled out and media came from everywhere equiped with boom mikes that started curbside and lined the red carpet!  Up came a shining limousine and out came a sparkling and radiant Mae West with a strapping guys in tuxedos on each arm...Mae in person looked magnificent and the crowd went wild...she strutted up the red carpet and stopped at each interviewer and popped off witty and very funny one liners that had everyone cracking up!  Mae West looked gorgeous and we gave her a standing ovation inside of the theatre when it was announced over the PA that she was in attendance then a spotlight lit her up...luckily seated a few rows in front of Maem, got to look directly at her and give her a big smile and let out a few Bravo's...Mae was beaming and it was a magical event never to forget!  Find it very sad some strangely put down her last effort to entertain and everyone loved this ""over the top"" entertaining movie on that great afternoon in Westwood and still do!  Recently watched Sextette with a friend and we laughed and loved every moment of the Magic Of Mae West with a fun cast of amusing characters including a wonderful performance by Dom Deluise...watch how Mae lights up when George Raft appears on screen with her! Those who think that life is perfect and legends never age...get over it and get a reality check. Thank you Mae West for your genius and sharing your incredible and wonderous gifts for some seventy-plus years and for the support that you warmly gave the Gay Community at a time when few would even get close...the best in the West left behind a treasure chest of classics for us to savor and enjoy!!! If you love Mae then grab this while you can as cult favorites such as Sextette usually have a short release run...BRAVO MAE WEST!",5,WE  CAME  UP  TO SEE MAE  AND  IT  WAS  GRAND!!!,1115683200,"05 10, 2005",2005,2813,"['Mae', 'West', 'one', 'most', 'brilliant', 'talents', 'ever', 'grace', 'Silver', 'Screen', 'single-handedly', 'saved', 'major', 'studio', 'going', 'depression', 'era', 'early', 'thirties', 'Legendary', 'movies', 'are', 'total', 'classics', 'make', 'Mae', 'one', 'greatest', 'ever', 'top', 'female', 'Superstars', '80', 'Mae', 'West', 'once', 'again', 'treated', 'view', 'legend', 'many', 'found', 'pleasure', 'fun', 'movie', 'once', 'again', 'chance', 'have', 'view', 'classic', 'very', 'legendary', 'Mae', 'West', 'God', 'anyone', 'age', 'Mae', 'was', 'never', 'conventional', 'having', 'started', 'motion', 'picture', 'career', 'forties', 'continued', 'following', 'decades', 'doing', 'various', 'stage', 'recording', 'projects', 'was', ""n't"", 'surprising', 'Mae', 'West', 'would', 'do', 'yet', 'motion', 'picture', 'once', 'again', 'eigthies', 'Mae', 'was', 'still', 'very', 'entertaining', 'had', 'thrill', 'going', 'preview', 'delightful', 'movie', '1978', 'Westwood', 'California', 'had', 'strong', 'feeling', 'Mae', 'West', 'would', 'attend', 'line', 'formed', 'arriving', 'early', 'were', 'red', 'velvet', 'ropes', 'soon', 'red', 'carpet', 'rolled', 'out', 'media', 'came', 'everywhere', 'equiped', 'boom', 'mikes', 'started', 'curbside', 'lined', 'red', 'carpet', 'Up', 'came', 'shining', 'limousine', 'came', 'sparkling', 'radiant', 'Mae', 'West', 'strapping', 'guys', 'tuxedos', 'arm', 'Mae', 'person', 'looked', 'magnificent', 'crowd', 'went', 'wild', 'strutted', 'up', 'red', 'carpet', 'stopped', 'interviewer', 'popped', 'off', 'witty', 'very', 'funny', 'one', 'liners', 'had', 'everyone', 'cracking', 'up', 'Mae', 'West', 'looked', 'gorgeous', 'gave', 'standing', 'ovation', 'theatre', 'when', 'was', 'announced', 'PA', 'was', 'attendance', 'then', 'spotlight', 'lit', 'up', 'luckily', 'seated', 'few', 'rows', 'front', 'Maem', 'got', 'look', 'directly', 'give', 'big', 'smile', 'let', 'out', 'few', 'Bravo', 'Mae', 'was', 'beaming', 'was', 'magical', 'event', 'never', 'forget', 'very', 'sad', 'strangely', 'put', 'down', 'last', 'effort', 'entertain', 'everyone', 'loved', 'top', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'great', 'afternoon', 'Westwood', 'still', 'do', 'Recently', 'watched', 'Sextette', 'friend', 'laughed', 'loved', 'moment', 'Magic', 'Mae', 'West', 'fun', 'cast', 'amusing', 'characters', 'including', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'Dom', 'Deluise', 'watch', 'how', 'Mae', 'up', 'when', 'George', 'Raft', 'screen', 'who', 'think', 'life', 'perfect', 'never', 'age', 'get', 'get', 'reality', 'check', 'Thank', 'Mae', 'West', 'genius', 'sharing', 'incredible', 'wonderous', 'gifts', 'seventy-plus', 'years', 'support', 'warmly', 'gave', 'Gay', 'Community', 'time', 'when', 'few', 'would', 'even', 'get', 'close', 'best', 'West', 'left', 'behind', 'treasure', 'chest', 'classics', 'savor', 'enjoy', 'love', 'Mae', 'then', 'grab', 'can', 'cult', 'favorites', 'such', 'Sextette', 'usually', 'have', 'short', 'release', 'run', 'BRAVO', 'MAE', 'WEST']",Sextette VHS

It is widescreen and from the master print, but not digitally corrected, so grain is still present. At last we can see Mae West's lips and eyebrows, unlike past prints, where we saw only a pale face and massive eyelashes. She looks very, very good for her age. In some shots she is a beautiful older lady, in some, well...there are only so many angles one can look great in, after the age of 60. It is interesting to note that private footage I have of West at the San Francisco premiere of 'Sextette' provide extreme close ups, and she looks roughly 55, smooth and vibrant. Her makeup is flawless as she walks up to a microphone and quips, ""I hope you enjoyed my demonstration of progressive ed-u-cation.""  The crowd of thousands is completely hysterical for her.This is not a film I usually show my younger friends when introducing them to the phenomenon that is Mae West, but I like it. Mae West was a trouper, totally dedicated to her image. Her co-stars are every bit as campy as she is in this film, and in fact, much more over the top than she. It is a great time capsule of the late 70's.a note: With all due respect to Ian Whitcomb (who is great at what he does) he was a little off in saying West referred to herself in the third person as ""Miss West.""  Indeed, she would often say ""We can't use that. Mae West would never say that."" But never ""Miss"" West. That would have been completely insane.

That Mae West decided to film ""Sextette"" in the late Seventies, when she was in her mid eighties, is the flip side of Garbo: the Baby-Jane-Norma-Desmond syndrome descended upon a new world with new values. And to pair West with the young Timothy Dalton and expect the audience to take the romance seriously further complicates this already messy film.  Part musical, part comedy, part Grand Guignol, this film should be seen for the five-star lesson it presents: know when to gracefully retire, leaving only the fondest of memories, Garbo-like, captured on film forever.",5,SEXTETTE: Don't Let This Happen To You!,1088812800,"07 3, 2004",2004,719,"['Greta', 'Garbo', 'retired', 'films', 'mid', 'thirties', 'did', 'more', 'keep', 'memory', 'mystique', 'alive', 'anything', 'else', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'Mae', 'West', 'decided', 'film', 'Sextette', 'late', 'Seventies', 'when', 'was', 'mid', 'eighties', 'flip', 'side', 'Garbo', 'Baby-Jane-Norma-Desmond', 'syndrome', 'descended', 'new', 'world', 'new', 'values', 'pair', 'West', 'young', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'expect', 'audience', 'take', 'romance', 'seriously', 'further', 'already', 'messy', 'film', 'Part', 'musical', 'part', 'comedy', 'part', 'Grand', 'Guignol', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'five-star', 'lesson', 'know', 'when', 'gracefully', 'retire', 'leaving', 'only', 'fondest', 'memories', 'Garbo-like', 'captured', 'film', 'forever']",Sextette VHS

Unfortunately, she seems to have thought that she could simply pick up where she left off.And I'm going to try not to be ageist, but her final film, ""Sextette,"" made me squirm -- it's kind of embarrassing watching the octogenarian West awkwardly creaking out double-entendres at men fifty years younger than herself. But the rest of the story is a mess as well, involving an audio tape, the UN, and secret agents.Movie star/sex symbol Marlo Manners (West) is marrying her sixth husband, British lord Sir Michael Barrington (Timothy Dalton). Their honeymoon is to be spent at a posh hotel, which also happens to be where all the world's leaders are congregating for some kind of conference.And while Sir Michael embarrasses himself for the press, Marlo is approached by a gaggle of her ex-husbands (including a presumed-dead mobster), all of whom are still desperately in love with her. And her evil manager (Dom Deluise) has convinced her to destroy the audio tape of her memoirs... except he keeps fudging it.If you've ever read a bad self-insert fanfic, you pretty much know the feeling that ""Sextette"" inspires... except it also makes you sad to see a great star looking like an awkward, lecherous mummy. It's all about how Marlo is the sexiest creature alive, and everybody with a Y chromosome -- including men SIXTY YEARS YOUNGER -- desperately wants to have sex with her.Most of the story is devoted just to that. Marlo sashays awkwardly around the hotel, creaking out dialogue mostly made up of double entendres (""Do you get a lot of proposals from your male fans?"" ""Yeah, and what they propose is nobody's business"").But ""Sextette"" does try to come up with more of a story... and it's a disaster. It's thin as paper and yet horrible convoluted. It tries to cram in wacky comedy, spy thrills and international intrigue, only to hamfistedly try to wrap them up in the silliest way possible. Also, there is singing. Horrible, awkward singing.As I mentioned, it's simply saddening to see Mae West as a hollow shell of herself, slathered in mortar-like makeup and looking somewhat mummified. She's also the only actor in this movie who doesn't look heartily ashamed of herself -- Timothy Dalton, Dom Deluise, Tony Curtis, Alice Cooper and the rest all look vaguely embarrassed, as if they can't remember how they got here.""Sextette"" is a little like watching your grandmother make a pass at your boyfriend -- embarrassing and horrendously awkward.

I can only imagine that Mae West must have put up the money for the film, because it just doesn't make sense!Mae West was never an accomplished dramatic actress.  She was a sex kitten - even a provacateur way ahead of her time - in mostly sexual comedies of the 1930's and 1940's.  At that, West was tops.In Sextette, West chose to resurrect a script she had written for production back in the 1930's.  It is the same script some 40 years later.  While that in and of itself is not a bad thing -West stars as the sex kitten once again!  That is not good.  The film is full of her famous inuendo (which is great), but it is also full of her famous inuendo uttered by her at the tender age of 150.Honestly, Mae West couldn't look worse!  She is shot through so much gauze that she actually looks plastic at times.  The director has mentioned that she couldn't remember her lines, so they shot her by herself and fed her lines through a device in her ear.  She just repeated the lines as only she could.That her costumes and her gait are the same some 40 years later is less a testament to the film and her abilities than it is to the sad nature of her career.  In an interview some years ago, a friend of hers noted that Mae West had long ago lost any semblance of who Mae West the woman was and only knew how to be ""Mae West: Sex Kitten"".  It wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the fact that she was in her late 80's when she appeared in this film (in fact she died less than two years after the film was released).The film is a quaint little sexual farce built inside a very light piece of intrigue.  The whole of the film hinges on West and it is West that you pay the price of admission to see.  However, to see Timothy Dalton play West's much younger husband is really icky.  George Hamilton and Dom Deluise also appear in large parts.It's a bizarre little film, that truly is a train wreck, but one worth the price of admission.

416014,AQQFI7YHMRL7S,6304346093,James Morris,"[22, 23]","This new edition of Sextette presents the film in Widescreen for the first time, with a new transfer from the original print.  This corrects the fact that when the previous DVD release was pressed, an  inferior print of the film was used, which meant that the VHS version was actually better than the DVD.As a fan of the late, great Mae West I would like to take the time to correct some factual errors repeated on the Amazon page for the original DVD by some of the other reviewers, and add a few comments of my own.  Miss West was 84 when she made this film in 1977; she died three years later on November 22, 1980, at the age of 87.  She did in fact attend the Hollywood premiere, and received a Lifetime Achievement award from After Dark magazine the same year.  The play Sextette was a minor comedy she starred in and wrote in 1961, not the 1920's.  When she toured with the stage play she was 68.  While it certainly is true that she was but a parody of herself by the time she made the film, many of her fans were grateful for the chance to see her perform one last time, as both her screen and television appearances were far too few in relation to her talent and comedic genius.The cast included many big-league supporting actors and cameos.  Timothy Dalton, George Raft, Rona Barrett, Dom De Louise, Tony Curtis, Ringo Starr, George Hamilton, Walter Pidgeon and even Alice Cooper all had scenes with the star, resulting in a film that can only be classified as pure camp.  It was a tribute to Miss West's reputation that so many of these stars were anxious to work with her.  I once met a lighting technician who was assigned to the original stage tour of Sextette, and he confirmed what I had always heard - Mae West was regarded as a total professional and a consummate artist by all who worked with her, and absolutely loved by the crews on both her movies and plays.Many critics were quick to promote the rumor that she was totally senile at the time of filming, and there were many rumors about how she had to have her lines fed to her through an ear-piece.  This rumor is belied by watching her lip-synch her way through any one of several songs on the soundtrack.  On ""Happy Birthday, 21"" for example, her timing is absolutely perfect and her lips move in complete harmony with the recording, not a minor feat for someone her age.  On a few of the funnier lines, her delivery is classic West at its best, and she shows flashes of her famous impeccable timing just as often as she shows her extreme age.  Yes, she looks, moves and talks like someone in their late 80's, but what can one expect?  The fact that she had the stamina and chutzpah at that age to even appear before the cameras was amazing in itself.Strictly for fans?  Absolutely, but I for one am glad she bothered.  If you want classic Mae West get a hold of I'm No Angel, She Done Him Wrong or Klondike Annie and see her in her prime, but if you are a devoted fan you will want to see this film as well.PS - It's about time that this woman had a major documentary devoted to her talents.  Her TV appearances, which are almost completely unavailable, include her 1959 Academy Award duet of BABY IT'S COLD OUTSIDE with Rock Hudson and guest stints on the Dean Martin and Red Skelton variety shows.

416018,A2R6RA8FRBS608,6304346093,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[7, 9]","Sextette tells the story of Marlo Manners, played by Mae West, who is in London to marry her sixth husband. Sir Michael Barrington, played so ably by Timothy Dalton, will be Marlo's sixth husband. Oh yes, they do get married--but after the wedding ceremony the press, Marlo's Hollywood agent Dan Turner and a cast of what seems like thousands all pester Marlo and Michael. They will not leave them alone to enjoy their wedding night. The plot is indeed thin and rather silly; but Sextette keeps your attention with its campy qualities and outlandish scenarios. The subplots poke fun at whirlwind courtships and Hollywood itself--excellent!Before the wedding night can begin, Marlo faces pressure to wine and dine a Russian diplomat so that he can have one last fling with her in exchange for his ""yes"" vote on an international accord. Of course, this subplot couldn't stop at that--this Russian diplomat would have to be one of Marlo's five ex husbands, too! Marlo's obligations don't end there--she must do screen tests in her honeymoon suite directed by another ex played wonderfully by Ringo Starr. Sir Michael Barrington also has a burden; he must prove to the public that he likes women after there is an honest misunderstanding during a television interview Sir Michael gives to Rona Barrett. To complicate matters even further, people hunt to find Marlo's memoirs tape which goes missing; this could harm Marlo's image if the press were to capture it.The subplots explore whirlwind courtships and the divorces that are obtained even faster than the courtships ever were. At one point Marlo's agent asks her if she remembered ""that week and a half when (she) was a widow."" Marlo remembers--and she did mourn the loss of her husband, too. Sure, she played the piano to forget her pain--but ""only the black keys.""The cinematography shines strongest in the opening scenes when the wedding procession arrives at the hotel; and the scenes filmed on top of the hotel are well done, too. The choreography of every scene in the hotel gymnasium and the international summit reflects careful planning, too. The song and dance numbers are particularly well choreographed.There are a few songs in this movie although I can't call it a ""true-blue"" musical. Marlo sings a rendition of ""Happy Birthday, Sweet Sixteen"" to a young athlete training in the hotel gymnasium. ""Hooray For Hollywood"" and ""Love Will Keep Us Together"" show forethought as well. Unfortunately, most of the other songs are cute but forgettable.There are numerous cameos to spice up the film even further: Look for George Hamilton who has a brief role as one of Marlo's ex husbands; a young Regis Philbin playing himself at the very beginning of the movie; Alice Cooper as a waiter and Rona Barrett playing herself as a television news reporter.The DVD does not come with any extras. This disappoints me but it is a minor flaw.I agree with the reviewer who writes that if you like Mae West you'll love Sextette. Fans of campy movies with razor thin plots will also enjoy this movie. This was Mae West's final film. Nevertheless, in Sextette Mae still did what she always did best--delivering punchy one line double-entendres and shimmying all over the screen as self-confident as ever.Hooray for Hollywood!",5,"Marlo, remember that week and a half when you were a widow?",1172188800,"02 23, 2007",2007,3268,"['Sextette', 'story', 'Marlo', 'Manners', 'played', 'Mae', 'West', 'who', 'London', 'marry', 'sixth', 'husband', 'Sir', 'Michael', 'Barrington', 'played', 'so', 'ably', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'will', 'be', 'Marlo', 'sixth', 'husband', 'Oh', 'yes', 'do', 'get', 'married', 'wedding', 'ceremony', 'press', 'Marlo', 'Hollywood', 'agent', 'Dan', 'Turner', 'cast', 'what', 'thousands', 'pester', 'Marlo', 'Michael', 'will', 'not', 'leave', 'alone', 'enjoy', 'wedding', 'night', 'plot', 'indeed', 'thin', 'rather', 'silly', 'Sextette', 'attention', 'campy', 'qualities', 'outlandish', 'scenarios', 'subplots', 'poke', 'fun', 'whirlwind', 'courtships', 'Hollywood', 'excellent', 'wedding', 'night', 'can', 'begin', 'Marlo', 'pressure', 'wine', 'dine', 'Russian', 'diplomat', 'so', 'can', 'have', 'one', 'last', 'fling', 'exchange', 'yes', 'vote', 'international', 'accord', 'course', 'subplot', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'Russian', 'diplomat', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'one', 'Marlo', 'five', 'ex', 'husbands', 'too', 'Marlo', 'obligations', 'do', ""n't"", 'end', 'there', 'must', 'do', 'screen', 'tests', 'honeymoon', 'suite', 'directed', 'ex', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'Ringo', 'Starr', 'Sir', 'Michael', 'Barrington', 'also', 'burden', 'must', 'prove', 'public', 'women', 'honest', 'misunderstanding', 'television', 'interview', 'Sir', 'Michael', 'Rona', 'Barrett', 'complicate', 'matters', 'even', 'further', 'people', 'hunt', 'find', 'Marlo', 'memoirs', 'tape', 'missing', 'could', 'harm', 'Marlo', 'image', 'press', 'were', 'capture', 'it.The', 'subplots', 'explore', 'whirlwind', 'courtships', 'divorces', 'are', 'obtained', 'even', 'faster', 'courtships', 'ever', 'were', 'one', 'point', 'Marlo', 'agent', 'remembered', 'week', 'half', 'when', 'was', 'widow', 'Marlo', 'remembers', 'did', 'mourn', 'loss', 'husband', 'too', 'Sure', 'played', 'piano', 'forget', 'pain', 'only', 'black', 'keys', 'cinematography', 'strongest', 'opening', 'scenes', 'when', 'wedding', 'procession', 'hotel', 'scenes', 'filmed', 'top', 'hotel', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'too', 'choreography', 'scene', 'hotel', 'gymnasium', 'international', 'summit', 'careful', 'planning', 'too', 'song', 'dance', 'numbers', 'are', 'particularly', 'well', 'choreographed.There', 'are', 'few', 'songs', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'call', 'true-blue', 'musical', 'Marlo', 'rendition', 'Happy', 'Birthday', 'Sweet', 'Sixteen', 'young', 'athlete', 'training', 'hotel', 'gymnasium', 'Hooray', 'Hollywood', 'Love', 'Will', 'Keep', 'Us', 'Together', 'show', 'forethought', 'as', 'well', 'Unfortunately', 'most', 'other', 'songs', 'are', 'cute', 'are', 'numerous', 'cameos', 'spice', 'up', 'film', 'even', 'further', 'Look', 'George', 'Hamilton', 'who', 'brief', 'role', 'one', 'Marlo', 'ex', 'husbands', 'young', 'Regis', 'Philbin', 'playing', 'very', 'beginning', 'movie', 'Alice', 'Cooper', 'waiter', 'Rona', 'Barrett', 'playing', 'television', 'news', 'reporter.The', 'DVD', 'not', 'come', 'extras', 'minor', 'flaw.I', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'who', 'like', 'Mae', 'West', ""'ll"", 'love', 'Sextette', 'Fans', 'campy', 'movies', 'razor', 'thin', 'plots', 'will', 'also', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'was', 'Mae', 'West', 'final', 'film', 'Nevertheless', 'Sextette', 'Mae', 'still', 'did', 'what', 'always', 'did', 'best', 'delivering', 'punchy', 'one', 'line', 'double-entendres', 'shimmying', 'screen', 'as', 'self-confident', 'ever.Hooray', 'Hollywood']",Sextette VHS

416020,A35FEM4C0LQTPN,6304346093,Mike Leone,"[9, 11]","Now, this is a real anomaly:  Mae West starring in a film based on a successful play she wrote back in 1926.  So theoretically, this film could have been made into a silent movie, and here it is, turning up over 50 years later in 1978.  And even in these more enlightened times, they didn't use the original title of Sex, calling it Sextette instead (although the opening credits put the first three letters into slight relief for those who might otherwise have missed it).I'm a big fan of Mae West, and I finally let my curiosity get the better of me about her final film, which I have been warned against many times.  Happily, I thought it was a delight from beginning to end.Mae West is unique in the history of sex stars in the movies because she was able somehow to both play the role of a sex goddess and simultaneously parody that same role.  So while other sex queens could not have gotten away with doing such a role as this one at the age of 85, Mae does much more than ""get away with it,"" and even at this age it's not all parody all the time.Allowances do have to be made for a very few things.  Her wig is one of them, her slightly bizarre makeup that makes her eyes seem way too far apart is another, and her slow movements from time to time is the final one.  Still, she has obviously taken very good care of herself over the years, and gets to show herself off at one point in a series of beautiful gowns (with Keith Moon over the top as her dress designer) as she supposedly prepares herself for a screen test.She is clearly having a lot of fun.  The film is set up so that she can consistently deliver the one-liners that made her famous.  And these one-liners still work for her, some 45 years after she used this technique in her first film.  (And the line about being ""the girl who works for Paramount all day and . . . "" is probably the funniest of any of her one-liners.)  I sat there with a huge smile on my face anytime Mae was onscreen.  I would consider her an inspiration to those who feel that after they reach a certain age, it's time to give up.  Mae West is just as effervescent and zestful here as she was in her 1930s films.Her co-stars are quite good, with Dom DeLuise leading the pack, followed closely by (in no particular order) Tony Curtis, Ringo Starr, George Hamilton, and Alice Cooper.  I hope I can be forgiven for thinking that Timothy Dalton, who makes up the final member of the Sextette of the title is not quite in their league (and by the way, ""sex"" is Latin for ""six"" and I suspect that the original title is more about this than it is about ""the act"").  Then again Dalton is playing the straight man to all these buffoons, and so his part is a little less showy than theirs.  Also, his singing voice is decent although he could stand some lessons on phrasing (not breaking the musical line partway through the phrase).And speaking of singing, Mae does three numbers through the course of the film.  She makes winners out of all three both through her singing voice (remember she even creditably sang opera in 1935's Goin' to Town) and through the force of her personality.  Now, this is something we would have missed out if Sextette had been made as a silent.There are a number of star cameo turns.  It's fun to see Regis Philbin way back when (I didn't realize he was that well known in 1978), it's a trip down memory lane to see the once-ubiquitous Rona Barrett, and a bit bizarre to see one Ed Beheler playing Jimmy Carter, something he apparently made a minor career out of (even in some GOP campaign ads).  Probably the most touching cameo is that of George Raft, who played the lead in Mae's first film, Night After Night, from 1932.And of course Mae loved to surround herself with bodybuilders, and she gets a scene with a number of them here.  And these are not just guys they picked up off the street; they all have athletic credentials or hold titles such as Mr. America, as is indicated in the closing credits.Okay, so Gone with the Wind it's not (hence 4 stars instead of 5).  It's still a lot of fun, and it's great to see Mae West go out in such grand style.",4,A fun romp,1151539200,"06 29, 2006",2006,4124,"['Now', 'real', 'anomaly', 'Mae', 'West', 'starring', 'film', 'based', 'successful', 'play', 'wrote', 'back', '1926', 'So', 'theoretically', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'silent', 'movie', 'here', 'turning', 'up', '50', 'years', 'later', '1978', 'even', 'more', 'enlightened', 'times', 'did', ""n't"", 'use', 'original', 'title', 'Sex', 'calling', 'Sextette', 'instead', 'opening', 'credits', 'put', 'first', 'three', 'letters', 'slight', 'relief', 'who', 'might', 'otherwise', 'have', 'missed', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'Mae', 'West', 'finally', 'let', 'curiosity', 'get', 'better', 'final', 'film', 'have', 'been', 'warned', 'many', 'times', 'Happily', 'thought', 'was', 'delight', 'beginning', 'end.Mae', 'West', 'unique', 'history', 'sex', 'stars', 'movies', 'was', 'able', 'somehow', 'play', 'role', 'sex', 'goddess', 'simultaneously', 'parody', 'same', 'role', 'So', 'other', 'sex', 'queens', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'gotten', 'away', 'doing', 'such', 'role', 'one', 'age', '85', 'Mae', 'much', 'more', 'get', 'away', 'even', 'age', 'not', 'parody', 'time.Allowances', 'do', 'have', 'be', 'made', 'very', 'few', 'things', 'wig', 'one', 'slightly', 'bizarre', 'makeup', 'eyes', 'seem', 'way', 'too', 'far', 'apart', 'slow', 'movements', 'time', 'time', 'final', 'one', 'Still', 'obviously', 'taken', 'very', 'good', 'care', 'herself', 'years', 'show', 'off', 'one', 'point', 'series', 'beautiful', 'gowns', 'Keith', 'Moon', 'top', 'dress', 'designer', 'supposedly', 'screen', 'test.She', 'clearly', 'having', 'lot', 'fun', 'film', 'set', 'up', 'can', 'consistently', 'deliver', 'one-liners', 'made', 'famous', 'one-liners', 'still', 'work', '45', 'years', 'used', 'technique', 'first', 'film', 'line', 'being', 'girl', 'who', 'Paramount', 'day', 'probably', 'funniest', 'one-liners', 'sat', 'huge', 'smile', 'face', 'anytime', 'Mae', 'was', 'onscreen', 'would', 'consider', 'inspiration', 'who', 'feel', 'reach', 'certain', 'age', 'time', 'give', 'up', 'Mae', 'West', 'just', 'effervescent', 'zestful', 'here', 'was', '1930s', 'films.Her', 'co-stars', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'Dom', 'DeLuise', 'leading', 'pack', 'followed', 'closely', 'particular', 'order', 'Tony', 'Curtis', 'Ringo', 'Starr', 'George', 'Hamilton', 'Alice', 'Cooper', 'hope', 'can', 'be', 'forgiven', 'thinking', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'who', 'up', 'final', 'member', 'Sextette', 'title', 'not', 'quite', 'league', 'way', 'sex', 'Latin', 'six', 'suspect', 'original', 'title', 'more', 'act', 'Then', 'again', 'Dalton', 'playing', 'straight', 'man', 'buffoons', 'so', 'part', 'little', 'less', 'showy', 'theirs', 'Also', 'singing', 'voice', 'decent', 'could', 'stand', 'lessons', 'phrasing', 'not', 'breaking', 'musical', 'line', 'partway', 'phrase', 'speaking', 'singing', 'Mae', 'three', 'numbers', 'course', 'film', 'winners', 'three', 'singing', 'voice', 'remember', 'even', 'creditably', 'sang', 'opera', '1935', 'Goin', 'Town', 'force', 'personality', 'Now', 'something', 'would', 'have', 'missed', 'out', 'Sextette', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'are', 'number', 'star', 'cameo', 'fun', 'see', 'Regis', 'Philbin', 'way', 'back', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'was', 'that', 'well', 'known', '1978', 'trip', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'see', 'once-ubiquitous', 'Rona', 'Barrett', 'bit', 'bizarre', 'see', 'one', 'Ed', 'Beheler', 'playing', 'Jimmy', 'Carter', 'something', 'apparently', 'made', 'minor', 'career', 'even', 'GOP', 'campaign', 'ads', 'Probably', 'most', 'touching', 'cameo', 'George', 'Raft', 'who', 'played', 'lead', 'Mae', 'first', 'film', 'Night', 'Night', '1932.And', 'course', 'Mae', 'loved', 'surround', 'bodybuilders', 'scene', 'number', 'here', 'are', 'not', 'just', 'guys', 'picked', 'up', 'street', 'have', 'athletic', 'credentials', 'hold', 'titles', 'such', 'Mr.', 'America', 'indicated', 'closing', 'credits.Okay', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'not', 'hence', '4', 'stars', 'instead', '5', 'still', 'lot', 'fun', 'great', 'see', 'Mae', 'West', 'go', 'out', 'such', 'grand', 'style']",Sextette VHS

416025,A2Q5Y2EMS6KDWI,6304346093,"Randy E. Halford ""Comedy Fan""","[1, 1]","The mere fact that 82-year old Miss Mae West actually made a film in 1977 is a pretty amazing thing. It took many years for her to realize filming her play ""Sextette"", but she got it done, to the delight of fans and the consternation of everyone else. Considering that her previous comeback ""Myra Breckinridge"" was such an utter disaster that this film seems like a joyful fling in comparison, Mae handles herself quite well here. The tone light & campy most of the time, Mae plays Marlowe Manners, a big-time movie star who's getting hitched (for the sixth time) to British gentleman Timothy Dalton (it's purely coincidental that a James Bond reference is made, considering he bagged the role a decade later). But the marriage is put on hold when peace talks keep breaking down (Mae's affiliation with this is her character was once married to Russian Alexis, played with flair by Tony Curtis). And so, Marlowe's manager (the always-funny Dom DeLuise) convinces her to ""take one for her country"" by stepping in & helping untangle this political mess. There's some amusing business with hubby Dalton jamming his foot in his mouth in interviews by insinuating he's gay (he misunderstands the meaning), and the contemporary covers of musical numbers are utterly cute & charming.So how does Mae look? Well, close up, she's just not as attractive (hence, plenty of long shots). But she's in good physical shape for her age, and she still sounds like the same ol' Mae West. Fans will be relieved that she hasn't lost her touch with tossing out her trademark racy one-liners, which surprisingly, haven't lost their impact for the 1970's. Some may be shocked that Marlowe is marrying a man decades younger. But then you have to consider the facts: Hugh Hefner nearly married a 25-yr. old Playmate; and Carol Burnett remarried someone over 30 yrs. her junior. So yep, it's perfectly acceptable.The parade of male actors is like a who's who of the times: Curtis, DeLuise, George Hamilton, Ringo Starr, Dalton, Walter Pigeon, Regis Philbin, Alice Cooper, Keith Moon, etc.Of course, Mae has some frollicks checking out the beefcake in a gym, and she flaunts some great costumes.Whether you love this film or thinks it's awful is up to you.

416026,A2P5BW17M2SBYX,6304346093,"Robert Brian Lamm ""robeezee""","[23, 39]","I think Rex Reed was correct when, in his initial review of this movie, he opined that its only value was perhaps ""as a training film for retired French whores"".  Ahh, the acting.... the songs.... the placement of the songs in the movie .....they all stink....... and seem to be the product of an adolescent mind with a wicked sense of humor.  Take a semi-lifelike Miss West, terribly overweight, age-inappropriate hair and garb, speech slurred, with an expressionless face similar to those seen hovering above bedpans across America, and then.... watch a scene in which a room full of men jump to their feet upon her entry.....to sing ""Babyface"" to her.  Is this a bad joke?  At better than 80, there is no part of a baby's anatomy that Miss West resembled, let alone its face.  The only commonality there is that both wore diapers.Miss West aged poorly - not only in the physical sense, but in spirit.  More accurately, she mummified, perhaps because she could not let go of the notion that she, and she alone, at any age, could be the only femme-fatale in a movie.  She behaved shamefully offscreen toward Raquel Welch in Myra Breckinridge; in Sextette, she is allowed to strut her stuff without competition.  The only problem is that her ""stuff"" hangs about two feet lower than it did in her heyday, and because of her excessive weight, she looks as swollen and shapeless as a tick.  This, from a woman often quoted as saying, ""Cultivate your curves - they may be dangerous, but they won't be avoided.""  The audience is asked to believe that every man in the movie is attempting to get into her knickers, including a Timothy Dalton (who is probably younger than one of Miss West's wigs).  And what IS with those stringy hang-dog wigs, anyway?  In her old movies, she was always beautifully coiffed - bobbed and in glossy finger waves.Those reviewers who assume that any criticism of this movie comes exclusively from folks who are unfamiliar with or unappreciative of Miss West in her early days are wrong.  I've seen all of her (earlier) movies, even have a very rare photograph of Miss West (her hair in smart brunette finger waves, since she had not yet decided to go blond) being arrested at the Bronx Opera House for leud public behavior (alluding to sex verbally while on stage).  Her week in jail was more valuable for its publicity than it was punitive.  However, this reviewer is saddened to see a movie that makes it as obvious as a poke in the eye that Miss West could not make the transition from center of attention-femme-fatale to more realistic roles -a la Joan Blondell, Marilyn Maxwell, Betty Grable.Some of the reviewers of this movie seem to regard Miss West's willingness to demonstrate [that her ego can triumph over complete physical decay] as some sort of show of good sportsmanship.  To this reviewer, it seems only a tad less desperate an act than self-immolation.After her heyday, I understand it was an unhappy, Norma Desmond-like life for Miss West, constantly trying to shut out the world around her, with its upcoming stars, the inevitable generation after generation of serious actors, all of whom she dismissed as talentless.  In the course of the few interviews she granted, there appeared to be an unhappy truce between Miss West and reality, with such unhealthy signs as her contending that no movies of value had been made since she stopped acting in them.  This, from a successful ex-vaudvillian who could push the envelope, always playing the same wisecracking broad, but beyond that one role, had no interest or real acting ability.  Yes, her movies were popular and breezy, and did save Paramount from bankruptcy.  She was a genious at creating illusion...throughout her career, a short, slightly chubby woman, she wore a corset, and always a gown with a long train that provided the illusion of height and statuesque presence.  The only time she stepped out of those amazing costumes was in one unfortunate movie in which she played a lion trainer, and her short, thick legs and heavy thighs did not benefit from exposure.  And so it was back to the streamlining gowns that she wore so well and to a career in which she continued to fascinate moviegoers.But that was 50 years ago.  This reviewer likes as much as the next person to be fascinated by people who don't appear to age like the rest of us common folk a la Sophia Loren or Catherine DeNeuve.  But as for Miss West looking good for her age, she looked age-inappropriate in Sextette - an odd-looking creature who vaguely resembles Bert Lahr in The Wizard of Oz.Was this movie a golden moment for Miss West?  I suppose she was lucky in that she wanted to film this ancient vanity piece, and found enough people willing to make it happen.  Of course, a few changes had to be made in the screenplay to bring it up to date - stagecoaches replaced by automobiles, references to the world being flat had to be edited out, etc.  In Miss West's little world, with lines being fed to her through a wire, I guess it might have been analagous to Norma Desmond's ""Big Closeup"" in which Gloria Swanson has a psychotic break and descends into the depths of madness.  Miss West's lines were so slurred that it sounded as if the wire were connected below, rather than above her waist.Other reviewers here have reported that Miss West passed away shortly after this film was released.  I wonder if the cause of death was listed as ""embarrassment"" or perhaps ""wire chafe"".If this movie has one redeeming quality, it lies in teaching us (by negative example) to let the world in as we get older, and try, as difficult as it may be, to embrace new approaches and ideas (and the younger generations that provide such challenge) - and to be generous.  I've occasionally had a hankering to trot out a Shakespear-esque play I wrote when I was 16, in which I play all the characters.  But 35 years later, I'm saavy enough to know that I no longer look good in leotards, and, like many men my age, although I have an ample though uninvited bosom able to fill any bustiere, this is a sight to which no audience should be subjected.If I could wish one thing for Miss West (since she did provide me with much entertainment and laughter in the early days), it would be that through the years of her life following her popularity, she'd learned to be more generous with other upcoming performers, and therefore have the ability to get pleasure from situations other than those in which she was the mandatory center of attention.",5,5 Stars for Unintended Humor,994896000,"07 12, 2001",2001,6500,"['think', 'Rex', 'Reed', 'was', 'correct', 'when', 'initial', 'review', 'movie', 'opined',

416030,A2SR8CWDTIKXAT,6304346093,Tell It Like It Is,"[5, 5]","I first bought this movie on VHS many years ago. I have every Mae West film, including the hard to find ""The Heats On"", which I don't think has ever been out on DVD. So believe me when I tell you, I am a huge fan of Mae West. I have her albums, a doll of her, books on her and a few other rare collectibles.Sextette is by no means ""oscar material"", but it makes no sense to me at all why so many people insist on bashing Sextette so badly. I must agree with the previous reviewer who said this movie only has a bad storyline if you compare it to Citizen Kane. In other words, taken for what it is, a fun, campy movie, Sextette is great.First off, I read in one of my Mae West books that making Sextette was NOT Mae's idea. She was approached by those who wanted it made and she agreed. They said she had good days when she was ""on"" and other days where they couldn't get her to remember anything. Other days she thought she was back in the 1930's. However, overall, her performance is wonderful and everyone in the cast was so good, they helped sell her. I don't know how much of that is true about her condition, but assuming it is, she did a great job. The Mae West we all know comes through in many scenes.To truly enjoy Sextette, first off you must suspend reality. Mae does not look like she's in her 80's here. She looks like she's around her late 50's or early 60's. I know a lot of women now in their 50's who don't look half as good as Mae did in this movie. In any case, we are encouraged to believe she is still the Mae West we knew in 1933. Once you forget the details about her age, and once you realize this is a campy 70's movie, you can appreciate that there really is a plot and there is a lot of funny stuff in this film which is well delivered. The performances of Ringo Starr, Dom Deluise, George Hamilton and others are excellent.Why did all these stars want to do this movie? Probably for the same reason true Mae West fans wanted to see it. A tribute to a legend. A woman who never let the system beat her down. A woman who took on Hollywood back when it was truely a man's world. A woman who saved Paramount studios from going bankrupt during the Great Depression. A woman who wrote her own screenplays and Broadway plays when those areas were also male dominated. Mae West was not just a great performer and entertainer, she was a great business woman and a great writer. She was truely ahead of her time.As for the criticisms about her age, I also agree with the previous reviewer who pointed out that Mae was almost 40 when she first came to Hollywood. When she did ""I'm No Angel"" in 1933 she was 40 and I think she looked great for 40, especially in a day long before anti-oxidants and botox. And as for her shape in Sextette, she sure doesn't look like a young woman, but her body isn't bad at all for her age. She's still got an hourglass shape. They shouldn't have given her a big, fluffy wedding gown in the opening scene, though. She'd have been better off with a tapered gown, but most of her gowns were gorgeous in this film and her dress maker in the movie is hilarious. Compare her shape here to her shape in the 1940 film ""My Little Chickadee"" with WC Feilds and she doesn't look all that different except for maybe a little more hunch to the shoulders.All in all this movie is a movie for Mae's fans. It gives us one last chance to see her do her thing and give us those fun one-liners that made her so famous. If I had to make any real criticism of this film, it would be that some of the musical numbers were not so fabulous. ""Love Will Keep Us Together"" was my least favorite, but even the cheesey musical numbers are fun enough to sit through. The creators of this movie did NOT intend this to be a serious musical like ""The Sound of Music"" or anything of that caliber.The bottom line is to suspend reality and enjoy it for what they intended it to be. A campy, fun tribute to a fabuous Hollywood legend. Nothing more or less than that.",5,"Sextette is all in good fun, nothing more",1199750400,"01 8, 2008",2008,3979,"['first', 'bought', 'movie', 'VHS', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'have', 'Mae', 'West', 'film', 'including', 'hard', 'find', 'Heats', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'ever', 'been', 'out', 'DVD', 'So', 'believe', 'when', 'tell', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'Mae', 'West', 'have', 'albums', 'doll', 'books', 'few', 'other', 'rare', 'collectibles.Sextette', 'means', 'oscar', 'material', 'sense', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'insist', 'bashing', 'Sextette', 'so', 'badly', 'must', 'agree', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'who', 'said', 'movie', 'only', 'bad', 'storyline', 'compare', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'other', 'words', 'taken', 'what', 'fun', 'campy', 'movie', 'Sextette', 'great.First', 'read', 'one', 'Mae', 'West', 'books', 'making', 'Sextette', 'was', 'NOT', 'Mae', 'idea', 'was', 'approached', 'who', 'wanted', 'made', 'agreed', 'said', 'had', 'good', 'days', 'when', 'was', 'other', 'days', 'where', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'remember', 'anything', 'Other', 'days', 'thought', 'was', 'back', '1930', 'However', 'overall', 'performance', 'wonderful', 'everyone', 'cast', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'helped', 'sell', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'much', 'true', 'condition', 'assuming', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'Mae', 'West', 'know', 'many', 'scenes.To', 'truly', 'enjoy', 'Sextette', 'first', 'must', 'suspend', 'reality', 'Mae', 'not', 'look', '80', 'here', 'around', 'late', '50', 'early', '60', 'know', 'lot', 'women', 'now', '50', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'half', 'as', 'good', 'Mae', 'did', 'movie', 'case', 'are', 'encouraged', 'believe', 'still', 'Mae', 'West', 'knew', '1933', 'forget', 'details', 'age', 'once', 'realize', 'campy', '70', 'movie', 'can', 'appreciate', 'really', 'plot', 'lot', 'funny', 'stuff', 'film', 'well', 'delivered', 'performances', 'Ringo', 'Starr', 'Dom', 'Deluise', 'George', 'Hamilton', 'others', 'are', 'excellent.Why', 'did', 'stars', 'want', 'do', 'movie', 'Probably', 'same', 'reason', 'true', 'Mae', 'West', 'fans', 'wanted', 'see', 'tribute', 'legend', 'A', 'woman', 'who', 'never', 'let', 'system', 'beat', 'down', 'woman', 'who', 'took', 'Hollywood', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'truely', 'man', 'world', 'woman', 'who', 'saved', 'Paramount', 'studios', 'going', 'bankrupt', 'Great', 'Depression', 'A', 'woman', 'who', 'wrote', 'own', 'screenplays', 'Broadway', 'plays', 'when', 'areas', 'were', 'also', 'male', 'dominated', 'Mae', 'West', 'was', 'not', 'just', 'great', 'performer', 'entertainer', 'was', 'great', 'business', 'woman', 'great', 'writer', 'was', 'truely', 'ahead', 'time.As', 'criticisms', 'age', 'also', 'agree', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'who', 'pointed', 'out', 'Mae', 'was', 'almost', '40', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'Hollywood', 'When', 'did', ""'m"", 'Angel', '1933', 'was', '40', 'think', 'looked', 'great', '40', 'especially', 'day', 'long', 'before', 'anti-oxidants', 'botox', 'shape', 'Sextette', 'sure', ""n't"", 'look', 'young', 'woman', 'body', ""n't"", 'bad', 'age', 'still', 'got', 'hourglass', 'shape', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'given', 'big', 'fluffy', 'wedding', 'gown', 'opening', 'scene', 'though', ""'d"", 'have', 'been', 'better', 'off', 'tapered', 'gown', 'most', 'gowns', 'were', 'gorgeous', 'film', 'dress', 'maker', 'movie', 'hilarious', 'Compare', 'shape', 'here', 'shape', '1940', 'film', 'Little', 'Chickadee', 'WC', 'Feilds', ""n't"", 'look', 'different', 'maybe', 'little', 'more', 'hunch', 'shoulders.All', 'movie', 'movie', 'Mae', 'fans', 'one', 'last', 'chance', 'see', 'do', 'thing', 'give', 'fun', 'one-liners', 'made', 'so', 'famous', 'had', 'make', 'real', 'criticism', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'musical', 'numbers', 'were', 'not', 'so', 'fabulous', 'Love', 'Will', 'Keep', 'Us', 'Together', 'was', 'least', 'favorite', 'even', 'cheesey', 'musical', 'numbers', 'are', 'fun', 'enough', 'sit', 'creators', 'movie', 'did', 'NOT', 'intend', 'be', 'serious', 'musical', 'Sound', 'Music', 'anything', 'caliber.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'suspend', 'reality', 'enjoy', 'what', 'intended', 'be', 'campy', 'fun', 'tribute', 'fabuous', 'Hollywood', 'legend', 'Nothing', 'more', 'less']",Sextette VHS
416031,A3IP0R4JOD4R5G,6304346093,the masked reviewer,"[1, 6]","The good news is that this is one of the most frightening horror movies ever made. The bad news is that it was supposed to be a musical comedy. (Bad comedies are painful, bad musicals are worse, and combining the two, then adding in liberal sexual innuendo involving an eighty-five year old former sexpot is agony.) But Sextette is never boring. It can't be...there's virtually a new TERROR around every corner!This unbelievably misguided project from director Ken Hughes and screenwriter Herbert Baker takes Mae West's 1926 play SEX and reimagines it as a romance between the 85-year old West and 32-year old Timothy Dalton. And while Mae and her latest hubbie (future James Bond star, Dalton) lounge around their palatial honeymoon suite, Mae reminisces about her past conquests while a roster of escapees from the Hollywood Squares stumble through.There's the always-confused Ringo Starr as a Stroheim-like director; leather-skinned George Hamilton as a pinstriped gangster; Alice Cooper in a permed `Barry Manilow-style' wig and tuxedo; Keith Moon as a foppy fashion designer; plus Dom DeLuise, George Raft, Regis Philbin, Rona Barrett -- the list of has-beens and never-will-be's goes on and on ...and on!  Meanwhile, the viewer gets to grind their teeth at the loose excuse for a plot, in which the U.S. government begs Mae to spend a night with one of her ex's, a Russian bigwig (Tony Curtis), in order to save diplomatic relations.But the show really belongs to its octogenarian leading lady, (who at this point in her life must have been giving her corset-maker hazard pay), in her final and most astounding screen role. The most bizarre thing about Sextette is that it pretends that its star is still in her twenties! and has her firing off racy double-entendres that will make every viewer nauseous with their quasi-necrophilic implications. The star is filmed in such soft-focus that one can barely make out her face. She shambles across the sets like she's about to fall over, and when she recites trademark zingers like, ""I'm the girl who works at Paramount all day and Fox all night,"" (Say it out loud), she seems to have forgotten what they mean. The most horrifying exchange comes when she caresses her breasts provocatively, causing Dalton to embrace her and break into an ear-melting rendition of ""Love Will Keep Us Together.""YES! Just when you think it's as cheesy as it could ever possibly get, the entire cast breaks into song and dance, and you remember it's also a freaking musical! You haven't lived until you've heard Dom DeLuise creaking out a cover of the Beatles' ""Honey Pie""? Other low lights have West crooning ""Happy Birthday"" while pawing a 21-year-old youth in a gym full of Olympic bodybuilders and lip-synching another standard to which she appears to have forgotten the words. And we'll bet you thought AT LONG LAST LOVE was interminable!...The whole mess ends with West singing ""Babyface"" (astonishingly, she's referring to herself) and sneaking onto Dalton's yacht for a really sick-making seduction scene. We'd like to tell you that the movie has a happy ending, (if having sex with an eighty-five year-old woman qualifies as ""happy"") but the viewer's side of the experience is something far less pleasant.Sextette is a jaw-droppingly Bad Move We Love that separates true worshipers of heinous cinema from the fainthearted.

416033,A24Q7Q8DXQUZ52,6304346093,Vinnie Rattolle,"[0, 0]","At the start of the DVD era, Rhino released ""Sextette"" in a cardboard snap-case but the quality was worse than the company's earlier VHS release and it featured no extras, a washed-out picture and sound that was practically inaudible even with the amps cranked up to 11.  Flash-forward to 2011 when the film got a beautiful HD transfer from the original IP negatives and two new DVD releases.  The open-matte full-screen edition is available in Mill Creek's setDangerous Babes (12 Movie Collection)), and Scorpion Entertainment's stand-alone DVD includes a widescreen print and a few extras.  The picture's so crisp that you can clearly see Mae West's cataracts though there's the occasional fleck of dirt and obligatory film grain as well as mono sound.  Still, for such a poorly-regarded film it's better than one could've hoped.If you're price-conscious, the 'Dangerous Babes' set is the way to go.  The disc is overcompressed (on a double-sided disc paired with three other low-budget dramas by the same production company) but otherwise the quality's pretty good.  Scorpion's release costs a little more but the widescreen version is framed better (let's be frank, this isn't an overtly cinematic film but there are a few sequences with dancers where more is visible on the sides), the disc compression is even and, if you're a fan of Mae West (why else would you still be reading?) there's a 40 minute interview with Ian Whitcomb, who produced an album for her (which ""Happy Birthday, 21"" was lifted from) and was hired as the music supervisor on the film... though he didn't retain that position.  Whitcomb got to know her at the end of her life and clearly had an affection for ""Miss West"" so his stories are funny, insightful -- and some remembrances about the film are recited straight from his personal diaries.  I don't know how Whitcomb got involved with this DVD release, but kudos to whomever arranged the interview.  Also available on the Scorpion release is a trailer, though the quality is pretty poor, and text ""liner notes"" by columnist Dennis Dermody.  Unlike Whitcomb's charming interview, Dermody's comments and remembrances are pretty mean-spirited.So unless/until this goes to Blu-Ray, Scorpion Entertainment's got the best release available.",5,Best DVD release?

Her unique delivery coupled with memorable, highly quotable double entendres (""Is that a gun in your pocket or are you just glad to see me?"") were the highlights of her early-'30s movies. In SEXTETTE (1978), her final film, a fossilized, eighty-something Mae delivers the same kind of dialogue that made her famous way back when, and the result is a textbook example of how not to grow old gracefully.In this West-scripted endeavor, Mae immodestly casts herself as sex queen Marlo Manners, the World's Most Desirable Woman (yikes!), who can't seem to keep men from pursuing her, even when she's on her honeymoon. The once-in-a-lifetime supporting cast includes Timothy Dalton, Tony Curtis, Ringo Starr, George Hamilton, Alice Cooper, Dom DeLuise, Keith Moon, George Raft, and Regis Philbin.
