258563,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,6301627768,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[1, 2]","`Dead Poets' Society' feels like a classic from start to finish.  The movie finds Robin Williams in a break-out role that transcends his earlier, comedic work.  Which is not to say he isn't funny at times in this movie; it's just that he's more well-rounded.  If we didn't care about the poor lads at Welton Academy, the whole film would fall apart.  A boarding school with the highest academic standards, Welton is presented as the epitome of 1950's conformity and convention.It all begins when alumna, John Keating (Williams) replaces a deceased English professor at the aforementioned school.  It's school motto is ""Tradition, Honor, Discipline, and Excellence"".  It lives up to the standards, even if the emotional needs of the all-male institution don't seem to be met.  Keating comes into the classroom, tearing at the textbook--literally, as well as metaphorically--while giving a context and a passion to find the meaning of poetry in their young lives.  Digging out his old yearbook, they discover he was a decorated academic figure with a colorful past:  He belonged to ""The Dead Poets' Society,"" a secret, male-bonding organization off the school's extracurricular path.  Wanting to emulate their ""Captain, My Captain,"" as he takes from Walt Whitman, they reinstate his contraband club by skirting curfew and meeting in their teacher's former lair, a cave, where they perform pagan rituals of passion and enjoyment.  Of course the whole affair is bound to bump heads with tradition and the administration, but the developments admirably keep our studied interest.While columnist George Will has stated objections to the movie, noting that gratitude back then was higher and the tragedy presented in the film was far lower, the main mentor is a mouthpiece of caution.  Good judgment is part and parcel to enjoyment of life.  Who then can argue that pursuing one's passion is the goal and impetus to avoid making life ""a life of quiet desperation,"" as he quotes Thoreau?  In a separate column, Will did argue that the fifties weren't ""The Dark Ages"" they have been reported to be, significantly citing the advent of Alan Ginsberg, a Beat Poet, as his evidence.  Nevertheless,  'Dead Poet's Society' supports a vision to grab the gusto in life and jealously guard one's dreams. Even though the actual cave scenes sometimes leave something to be desired, they are important for the development of the flow and the plot of the movie.  They certainly are genuine.  Making poetry a living art to try and match the soul is work of a real mentor.  Even taken with a grain of salt, the movie's message is convincing and important.",4,Breathing Life into School,1174003200,"03 16, 2007",2007,2631,"['Dead', 'Poets', 'Society', 'feels', 'classic', 'start', 'finish', 'movie', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'break-out', 'role', 'earlier', 'comedic', 'work', 'Which', 'not', 'say', ""n't"", 'funny', 'times', 'movie', 'just', 'more', 'well-rounded', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'poor', 'lads', 'Welton', 'Academy', 'whole', 'film', 'would', 'fall', 'apart', 'boarding', 'school', 'highest', 'academic', 'standards', 'Welton', 'presented', 'epitome', '1950', 'conformity', 'convention.It', 'begins', 'when', 'alumna', 'John', 'Keating', 'Williams', 'deceased', 'English', 'professor', 'aforementioned', 'school', 'school', 'motto', 'Tradition', 'Honor', 'Discipline', 'Excellence', 'up', 'standards', 'even', 'emotional', 'needs', 'all-male', 'institution', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'met', 'Keating', 'classroom', 'tearing', 'textbook', 'literally', 'as', 'well', 'metaphorically', 'giving', 'context', 'passion', 'find', 'meaning', 'poetry', 'young', 'lives', 'Digging', 'out', 'old', 'yearbook', 'discover', 'was', 'decorated', 'academic', 'figure', 'colorful', 'past', 'belonged', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'Society', 'secret', 'male-bonding', 'organization', 'school', 'extracurricular', 'path', 'Wanting', 'emulate', 'Captain', 'My', 'Captain', 'Walt', 'Whitman', 'reinstate', 'contraband', 'club', 'skirting', 'curfew', 'meeting', 'teacher', 'former', 'lair', 'cave', 'where', 'perform', 'pagan', 'rituals', 'passion', 'enjoyment', 'course', 'whole', 'affair', 'bound', 'bump', 'heads', 'tradition', 'administration', 'developments', 'admirably', 'keep', 'studied', 'interest.While', 'columnist', 'George', 'Will', 'stated', 'objections', 'movie', 'noting', 'gratitude', 'back', 'then', 'was', 'higher', 'tragedy', 'presented', 'film', 'was', 'far', 'lower', 'main', 'mentor', 'mouthpiece', 'caution', 'Good', 'judgment', 'part', 'parcel', 'enjoyment', 'life', 'Who', 'then', 'can', 'argue', 'pursuing', 'one', 'passion', 'goal', 'impetus', 'avoid', 'making', 'life', 'life', 'quiet', 'desperation', 'Thoreau', 'separate', 'column', 'Will', 'did', 'argue', 'fifties', 'were', ""n't"", 'Dark', 'Ages', 'have', 'been', 'reported', 'be', 'significantly', 'citing', 'advent', 'Alan', 'Ginsberg', 'Beat', 'Poet', 'evidence', 'Nevertheless', ""'Dead"", 'Poet', 'Society', 'vision', 'grab', 'gusto', 'life', 'jealously', 'guard', 'one', 'dreams', 'Even', 'actual', 'cave', 'scenes', 'sometimes', 'leave', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'are', 'important', 'development', 'flow', 'plot', 'movie', 'certainly', 'are', 'genuine', 'Making', 'poetry', 'living', 'art', 'try', 'match', 'soul', 'work', 'real', 'mentor', 'Even', 'taken', 'grain', 'salt', 'movie', 'message', 'convincing', 'important']",N/A

We're introduced to a group of boys who study in this school: Neil (Robert Sean Leonard, in a good performance here unlike some later movies), the leader of his group, who's in constant odds with his dad about practically everything: his dad wants him to go to med school, and to give up all extra corricular activities that aren't directly contributing to his career 'choice', such as editing the school paper or acting. His room mate, Todd Anderson,is the shy new boy, who is overshadowed by his older brother (Ethan Hawke, as good as always). Their friends include Meks & Pitts, the 'geeks', Charlie Dalton the nice class 'Bad Boy', Cameron, the not - very - nice teachers' pet, and Knox Overstreet - a sensitive & quiet boy (by the way, has anyone else noticed that all of these guys are sensitive except for Cameron, who's the total & obnoxious opposite?).Robin Williams, Mr. Keating, or 'the Captain' as he likes to be called, is a graduate of Welton school,is hired as an English teacher. He tries to inspire his students to live their lives to the fullest, and to enjoy poetry even thoguh they might think it's 'useless' for their lives and future careers, and just live their lives to the fullest. He also inspires them to recreate the 'Dead Poets Society"" he and his friends had formed while in school - a group that gathered to enjoy poetry.Slowly this is taking effect: Knox decides to go after a girl he likes, and Todd seems to be coming out of his shell. But this attitude takes a disasterous turn with Neil: he decides to join a play without telling his dad (which he knows won't approve) and his dad finds out, and tells him to quit it. Neil is upset, and asks for Mr. Keating's advice, which is reasonable: don't go against your father, but try to convince him, and if that doesn't work, just wait until you're on your own. Neil still decideds to go aheard with the play, and is discovered by his father. When his dad decides to send him to military school, Neil commits suicide. Eventually, Mr. Keating is blamed for Neil's death, and is fired from the school.On the most basic level possible, this movie is a classic teens against grownups that just don't understand, while Mr. Keating is the adult who's 'cool' enough to understand the boys. But on a different level, the movie also question's the 'CARPE DIEM' philosophy - Knox gets in trouble with his love interest's boyfriend, and Neil, after all, chose to lose his life to follow it. The movie has a very extremist attitude towards this issue - the school 'wrongly' accuses Mr. Keating in Neil's death, but the questions of how far to take his ideas are still there for people who are looking for them...",5,Good movie!,1022630400,"05 29, 2002",2002,2879,"['beginning', 'school', 'year', 'Welton', 'conservative', 'prep', 'school', 'age', 'where', 'crew', 'cuts', 'rule', 'boys', 'wish', 'be', 'bankers', 'lawyers', 'doctors', 'parents', 'wish', 'be', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'group', 'boys', 'who', 'study', 'school', 'Neil', 'Robert', 'Sean', 'Leonard', 'good', 'performance', 'here', 'later', 'movies', 'leader', 'group', 'who', 'constant', 'odds', 'dad', 'practically', 'everything', 'dad', 'go', 'med', 'school', 'give', 'up', 'extra', 'corricular', 'activities', 'are', ""n't"", 'directly', 'contributing', 'career', ""'choice"", 'such', 'editing', 'school', 'paper', 'acting', 'room', 'mate', 'Todd', 'Anderson', 'shy', 'new', 'boy', 'who', 'overshadowed', 'older', 'brother', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'as', 'good', 'always', 'friends', 'include', 'Meks', 'Pitts', ""'geeks"", 'Charlie', 'Dalton', 'nice', 'class', 'Boy', 'Cameron', 'not', 'very', 'nice', 'teachers', 'pet', 'Knox', 'Overstreet', 'sensitive', 'quiet', 'boy', 'way', 'anyone', 'else', 'noticed', 'guys', 'are', 'sensitive', 'Cameron', 'who', 'total', 'obnoxious', 'opposite', '.Robin', 'Williams', 'Mr.', 'Keating', 'Captain', 'be', 'called', 'graduate', 'Welton', 'school', 'hired', 'English', 'teacher', 'inspire', 'students', 'live', 'lives', 'fullest', 'enjoy', 'poetry', 'even', 'thoguh', 'might', 'think', 'lives', 'future', 'careers', 'just', 'live', 'lives', 'fullest', 'also', 'recreate', ""'Dead"", 'Poets', 'Society', 'friends', 'had', 'formed', 'school', 'group', 'gathered', 'enjoy', 'poetry.Slowly', 'taking', 'effect', 'Knox', 'go', 'girl', 'Todd', 'be', 'coming', 'shell', 'attitude', 'disasterous', 'turn', 'Neil', 'join', 'play', 'telling', 'dad', 'wo', ""n't"", 'approve', 'dad', 'out', 'quit', 'Neil', 'upset', 'Mr.', 'Keating', 'advice', 'reasonable', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'father', 'try', 'convince', ""n't"", 'work', 'just', 'wait', ""'re"", 'own', 'Neil', 'still', 'go', 'aheard', 'play', 'discovered', 'father', 'When', 'dad', 'send', 'military', 'school', 'Neil', 'suicide', 'Eventually', 'Mr.', 'Keating', 'blamed', 'Neil', 'death', 'fired', 'school.On', 'most', 'basic', 'level', 'possible', 'movie', 'classic', 'teens', 'grownups', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'Mr.', 'Keating', 'adult', 'who', ""'cool"", 'enough', 'understand', 'boys', 'different', 'level', 'movie', 'also', 'question', ""'CARPE"", 'DIEM', 'philosophy', 'Knox', 'trouble', 'love', 'interest', 'boyfriend', 'Neil', 'chose', 'lose', 'life', 'follow', 'movie', 'very', 'extremist', 'attitude', 'towards', 'issue', 'school', ""'wrongly"", 'accuses', 'Mr.', 'Keating', 'Neil', 'death', 'questions', 'how', 'far', 'take', 'ideas', 'are', 'still', 'there', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'looking']",N/A

The point really driven home by the movie though is to stand up for one's beliefs throughout all of life no matter how hard it may prove. Now, while the character of Neil, does try to do what he feels he must without regard to his father, in the end, he doesn't stand up at all, but simply accepts his father's authority.

Even in what is essentially a serious role, he injects a good bit of humor, but always appropriately. For example, in explaining about how to understand Shakespeare, he does half-a-dozen side-splitting imitations of famous actors in Shakespearean roles, including John Wayne. Now admit it, you never figured John Wayne for a role in Shakespeare, did you? But Robin Williams would, and so would John Keating, English teacher at a stuffy boys' prep school. Of course the administration disapproves of his teaching methods, and even his goals. He says bluntly that he wants the boys to learn how to think for themselves, and that's not what the headmaster wants. It's also not what the parents want.So what is the Dead Poets Society? When Keating was a student the same prep school, he and a group of his friends met in a cave off campus where they read poetry and could talk about whatever they wanted to, without anyone to rat on them or teachers to disapprove. Asking his students whether they can keep a secret, he tells them about the Society, and even loans/gives them the Society's poetry book.One of the boys, Neil, is being bullied into preparing for medical school by his domineering father. Neil wants to be an actor. He tries out for a part in a play being put on in conjunction with the nearby co-ed school, forging his father's signature for permission. They're doing ""A Midsummer Night's Dream,"" and he is Puck. The lead! And he's good, really good.

258574,ALR35EFI69S5R,6301627768,"Barron Laycock ""Labradorman""","[6, 7]","This film represented a breakaway opportunity for comedian Robin William, and the star of such other films as ""The World According To Garp"" wasted no time establishing himself as a serious actor with the role of John Keating in ""The Dead Poets' Society"".  In his stand-up routines, Williams performance is quicksilver, and he can quickly be all over the place all at once, his mind seemingly moving at something approaching the speed of light itself. So it is interesting and impressive indeed to observe him here in such a constrained effort to be consistent and predictable, and a bit understated at that.I had more than a passing personal interest in the subject matter, having been a private school history teacher myself, and yet I felt quite comfortable with the kind of character Williams portrayed, as I found his interpretation of the professor to be both plausible and understandable.  The story itself is interesting and provocative; Williams plays an English Literature teacher who returns to his alma mater and is horrified by the crass materialism and lack of intellectual curiosity the students are exhibiting. Thus, he mystifies and then intrigues a few of the students with his unconventional histrionics and intellectual zeal, and his palpable subtext of alternative ways to look at, experience and launch oneself out into the larger world beyond the campus.Two of the students, played by a very young Ethan Hawke and Robert Sean Leonard, fall under William's considerable charm and influence. Yet Leonard's father is adamantly opposed to such nonsense, and vehemently works against his son's ethereal concerns and interests. Thus is the stage set for a tragedy of monumental proportions. This is an absorbing and thoughtful period piece, and I enjoyed the insider's look at prep schools the way they existed in the time frame of the late 1950s and early 1960s.  It will not only entertain you, but also give you cause for some thought and reflection. I can highly recommend this film.

Robin Williams gives another outstanding performance as  he always does.  I do have a bone to pick with people who simply think  this film is too wonderful for words and cannot see the other problems the  film suffers. I am a teacher of High School students myself, and I guess I  always find myself looking more closely at pictures like this one,  Dangerous Minds, Stand &amp; Deliver, etc. There seems to be a tendency, in  this picture, to convey to the audience that one class, one man can  instantly inspire youngsters in a brief period. There are rewards in  teaching, but it is just not that easy to see the immediate rewards and  sometimes it is years later when kids come back and thank you. This film  seems to be saying, also, that it is okay to challenge an established order  whenever it seems fit. There are times when conformity is necessary(and  maybe the producers and writers of the picture know this and this is all  presumptious).  You have to look at both sides of the coin here. The  film casts Keating as a hero, and the officials of the school, who pride  the schools' successful record of achievement with the 4 pillars, as the  heavys. I did feel real sympathy for the character of Neal Perry(wonderful  acting job by Robert Sean Leonard) who is torn between obeying his stern  father's wishes and going for his dream. It is, indeed, a tragic situation.  I don't think that the film should be viewed in simple black and white  terms in that Keating is good and the parents &amp; school officials are  bad.

I can easily tell why my teacher felt this film this appropriate to show to students who are becoming writers: it helps inspire writers. First of all, the inspiring teacher played by Robin Williams gives a few important lessons. He tells them to rip out the serious, practical pages of the book in order to focus on unordinary, creative ideas. He tells them to &quot;Sieze the day&quot;, not by actually stating it, but you would have to see the movie to understand what I mean. Other staff at the school become displeased with him because they find his lessons to be untraditional. It goes to show that sometimes people have to go beyond the ideas of the world and come up with their own ideas. Second of all, the characters include some very silly, callow young boys who learn about poetry. As a teenager, I saw my own generation in these youth, though the setting I believe is about forty or fifty years ago. The viewer sees how these normal juvenilles end up learning some important lessons in life and discover their intellectuals. This is an excellent inspiration for young people of today(it's no wonder why so many college students like this movie). In the end, the story gets pretty intense. Someone ends up dieing in the end, but it's not one of those pointless, sentimental scenes we see in some types of movies.  It leads to questions, which makes the viewer really think. After all that happens in the end, the young characters never give up their hopes or loyalty. This is truely a very thoughtful film and inspiring, as I said before. It also had many very good lines that I would just love to list and quote. So if you are a yound, avid free-lance writer, this would be the film for you to invest in and learn from. I was surprised to learn it is more well known and popular than I thought, which is a good sign because it shows that many know where to look for inspiration.",5,A film that inspires writers.,983577600,"03 3, 2001",2001,1959,"['saw', 'movie', 'last', 'year', 'high', 'school', 'creative', 'writing', 'class', 'can', 'easily', 'tell', 'why', 'teacher', 'felt', 'film', 'appropriate', 'show', 'students', 'who', 'are', 'becoming', 'writers', 'inspire', 'writers', 'First', 'all', 'inspiring', 'teacher', 'played', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'few', 'important', 'lessons', 'rip', 'out', 'serious', 'practical', 'pages', 'book', 'order', 'focus', 'unordinary', 'creative', 'ideas', 'quot', 'day', 'quot', 'not', 'actually', 'stating', 'would', 'have', 'see', 'movie', 'understand', 'what', 'mean', 'Other', 'staff', 'school', 'become', 'displeased', 'find', 'lessons', 'be', 'untraditional', 'show', 'sometimes', 'people', 'have', 'go', 'ideas', 'world', 'come', 'up', 'own', 'ideas', 'Second', 'characters', 'include', 'very', 'silly', 'callow', 'young', 'boys', 'who', 'learn', 'poetry', 'teenager', 'saw', 'own', 'generation', 'youth', 'setting', 'believe', 'forty', 'fifty', 'years', 'ago', 'viewer', 'how', 'normal', 'juvenilles', 'end', 'up', 'learning', 'important', 'lessons', 'life', 'discover', 'intellectuals', 'excellent', 'inspiration', 'young', 'people', 'today', 'wonder', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'college', 'students', 'movie', 'end', 'story', 'pretty', 'intense', 'Someone', 'up', 'dieing', 'end', 'not', 'one', 'pointless', 'sentimental', 'scenes', 'see', 'types', 'movies', 'questions', 'viewer', 'really', 'think', 'end', 'young', 'characters', 'never', 'give', 'up', 'hopes', 'loyalty', 'truely', 'very', 'thoughtful', 'film', 'inspiring', 'said', 'also', 'had', 'many', 'very', 'good', 'lines', 'would', 'just', 'love', 'list', 'quote', 'So', 'are', 'yound', 'avid', 'free-lance', 'writer', 'would', 'be', 'film', 'invest', 'learn', 'was', 'surprised', 'learn', 'more', 'well', 'known', 'popular', 'thought', 'good', 'sign', 'many', 'know', 'where', 'look', 'inspiration']",N/A

In the beginning I wasn't sure the story was going to contain a message that I liked about ""free thinking""--especially since I'm not quite as crazy about Walt Whitman as Mr. Keating was--but by the time it ended, I was jubilant about the movie's very good message.  I felt the ""free thought"" was tempered by the depth of Keating's mature love for the boys, and his wise counsel.  He had a mature sense of how  prudent responsibility had to go hand-in-hand with freedom.  He showed that conscientiousness had to be a part of the courage to think and act  ""against the grain.""(Wonder of wonders, I decided to pick up this movie and watch it on a day when I needed diversion from despondency about having failed in expressing to someone a message about ""individuality""--somewhat like the one this movie deals with.  And the movie turned out to help me feel a lot better.)The setting is ""the best prep school in America,"" a classically traditional academic institution whose foundational Four Pillars are Tradition, Honor, Discipline, Excellence.  The story's themes relate to concepts of Freedom, Conformity, and Authority.  Also the Love of Teaching, and the charism of a very outstanding teacher.While watching the movie I thought what immense difficulty and responsibility there is in the education of boys.  I pondered about the importance of what kind of ideals and convictions make up the substance of a teacher's own convictions--just what his obdurate insistences are going to be--especially when male mentors are showing boys How to be ""responsible"" Men.  That word ""responsible"" can have many ramifications, as for instance Keating's insistence upon living Life fully with all the strength of one's being.  It's an awesome scene when Keating drags really striking ""poetry"" out of shy and silent Anderson.  (I especially identified with Anderson.)The musical choices for the sound tract were very well-suited to the action and even served as a musical ""commentary""of sorts--not just random accompaniment.I think it's a great movie, very successful, very effective.

Robin Williams stars as John Keating, an inspirational and unconventional English teacher in an atmosphere of strict conformity. The school is one that rigid, simplistic parents send their young men to, and they expect the education to be formal, complete and without deviation from the prescribed path.Williams arrives at the school and teaches the boys the joy of breaking with the mass lockstep and thinking for themselves. A group re-forms the Dead Poets Society, where they sneak out of their dorm rooms and meet in an Indian cave and read classical poetry. It is a club like those formed by young men since they first existed, a chance for them to rebel against their restrictions and branch out into new and forbidden areas.However, when one of the boys chooses to act in violation of his father's edicts, the father responds with an ultimatum. When the boy chooses suicide over giving up acting, a scapegoat must be found and Keating is the ""logical"" choice. The boys are forced to sign statements blaming Keating for the death of their friend, with some being completely shameless about it. In a touching scene at the end, the most rebellious of the boys stands on his desk and says to Keating,  ""Oh Captain! My Captain!"", from a poem of the same name penned by Walt Whitman and dedicated to the memory of the assassinated Abraham Lincoln. Others follow his lead and only the most heartless of us can watch that scene and not generate a teardrop.In my opinion, this is the best movie Williams has ever done; his character is forceful, imaginative, and creative and pays dearly for his excellence.

Also, it was a film in which he did not have the most screen time. His character is not the central focus; rather it is the boys who play the students in his class that get the bulk of the screen time for it is their story. The film is the in the tradition of other classic prep school stories like A Separate Peace and The Catcher in the Rye that are poignant coming-of-age tales that feature conflicts between individuality and conformity.Williams is quite good and very believable as an English teacher. Director Peter Weir reigns him in and not once does the comedian go on one of his trademark manic tears but still has his funny moments. More importantly, he evokes a passion for literature and this in turn inspires his students who resurrect an old tradition of his when he was a student at the school - The Dead Poets Society, a group of boys who met, after lights out, at the old Indian cave and recited their favourite poetry and even some of their own.Weir perfectly captures the look and atmosphere of the northeast in autumn with orange and brown coloured leaves on trees or lying on the ground as winter approaches. He also accurately depicts the rarified atmosphere of private school life: the camaraderie of the boys, the secret breaking of the rules, and the strict adherence to tradition. He shows us glimpses of the day-to-day goings on: chapel first thing in the morning, classes where one learns the standards (Latin, Trig, etc.) and the participation in sports like rowing.""Dead Poets: A Look Back"" features cast members Ethan Hawke, Robert Sean Leonard, Kurtwood Smith and others praising Weir's skills as a director.

Robin Williams is superb in his role as a highly creative English teacher, John Keating, at a conservative prep school in the 1950s. From the moment he first began teaching poetry by taking the class out of the room to listen to old photos in the main hall whispering, ""Carpe Diem!"" to the wildly amusing time in which he instructed his students to rip the entire first section out of their poetry books, Williams shines as one of the most brilliant examples of an inspirational teacher ever to appear in film.The concept of the DEAD POETS SOCIETY is explained when Professor Keating tells his students about how he had once belonged to this secret group that would meet in the middle of the night in a cave off campus to read poetry with passion... and to find the true passion in life. It's a true joy to see Keating's students become ablaze with fresh enthusiasm for poetry, life and love... even when the price of following one's passion in such a conservative setting can be quite steep.The setting, script, casting, acting, and directing for DEAD POETS SOCIETY are all exceptionally wonderful... leaving one feeling revitalized and inspired after viewing it.

I've probably seen Dead Poet's Society a dozen times and while I still think it is a beautiful motion picture in its message about how the power of the written word as a tool for free thought is a life-changing force, I can't seem to find it in me to think it's possible that a teacher could have reached teenaged boys in quite that way. Well, I guess that's why we have films, so we can see things we wouldn't in life. All this said, I do believe Dead Poet's Society is a classic. If you haven't seen it, you probably should.

That said there are those that succeed on every level like `A Beautiful Mind' or `Mr. Holland's Opus' and even `Dangerous Minds' to an extent.  Then you have those that fail miserably.  But this film is neither.  It failed to move me in ways never done before, but it also carried enough weight to make the experience worth the time spent viewing it.  `Dead Poets Society' is a film about being who you are despite what the rest of society wants you to be.  It's about expressing yourself in the face of adversity.  The idea of a bunch of male college students secretly sneaking off campus to read poetry is pretty lame and far fetched, but it's the ferocity in their eyes while in the class room that makes up for the plot.Robin Williams plays English Professor John Keating.  Keating is unlike any professor these boys have ever seen.  He challenges them to look past the text book and truly ""Carpe Diem"" (seize the day).  His enthusiasm for life and the pursuit of ones dreams has a positive effect on his students, two in particular.  First is Neil (Leonard) who dreams of a career in theater against the wishes of his overbearing father (Kurtwood Smith).  The second is Todd (Hawke) who is still trying to find himself, separating himself from his unconcerned and somewhat uncaring parents.  As Keating continues to encourage the boys to think for themselves they are hit with adversity, from parents as well as fellow teachers.To me the real standout performance here is Hawke who commanded the screen and delivered the most memorable performance.  Next would be Smith who plays the overbearing father perfectly, as seen by anyone whose watched `That 70's Show', but Smith was able to erase all comedic subtext from his performance and give us raw emotion.  I feel bad for Robert Sean Leonard because it seems that no matter what film he's starring in (and face it, he was the star...he had more screen time than Williams) he is always outshined by the supporting players.  Williams, to me, was a disappointment.  He didn't convey the same ferocity I've seen in almost every other performance he's given.  I'm a huge fan of Williams so I was saddened to be so disappointed.I was discussing this movie with my best friend the other day and he was saying how it was one of his favorite movies.  We got into the discussion of teacher/student films and their adaptation over the years.  Recent films like `A Beautiful Mind', one of my personal favorite films, really touched on a deeper level to me, but that's just the progression of time I guess.  That's not to say that `Dead Poets Society' isn't a good film, that's just to say that entertainment has progressed to the point where it's become more of a good film than a great one.  It will be remembered for a long time to come, and that's what matters in the long run.",4,"""Captain, my captain...""",1158278400,"09 15, 2006",2006,2881,"['influx', 'teacher/student', 'movies', 'will', 'never', 'cease', 'said', 'are', 'succeed', 'level', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'Mr.', 'Holland', 'Opus', 'even', 'Dangerous', 'Minds', 'extent', 'Then', 'have', 'fail', 'miserably', 'film', 'failed', 'move', 'ways', 'never', 'done', 'before', 'also', 'carried', 'enough', 'weight', 'make', 'experience', 'time', 'spent', 'viewing', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'Society', 'film', 'being', 'who', 'are', 'what', 'rest', 'society', 'be', 'expressing', 'face', 'adversity', 'idea', 'bunch', 'male', 'college', 'students', 'secretly', 'sneaking', 'off', 'campus', 'read', 'poetry', 'pretty', 'lame', 'far', 'fetched', 'ferocity', 'eyes', 'class', 'room', 'up', 'plot.Robin', 'Williams', 'English', 'Professor', 'John', 'Keating', 'Keating', 'professor', 'boys', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'look', 'text', 'book', 'truly', 'Carpe', 'Diem', 'seize', 'day', 'enthusiasm', 'life', 'pursuit', 'ones', 'dreams', 'positive', 'effect', 'students', 'two', 'particular', 'First', 'Neil', 'Leonard', 'who', 'career', 'theater', 'wishes', 'overbearing', 'father', 'Kurtwood', 'Smith', 'second', 'Todd', 'Hawke', 'who', 'still', 'trying', 'find', 'separating', 'unconcerned', 'somewhat', 'uncaring', 'parents', 'Keating', 'encourage', 'boys', 'think', 'are', 'hit', 'adversity', 'parents', 'as', 'well', 'fellow', 'real', 'standout', 'performance', 'here', 'Hawke', 'who', 'commanded', 'screen', 'delivered', 'most', 'memorable', 'performance', 'Next', 'would', 'be', 'Smith', 'who', 'overbearing', 'father', 'perfectly', 'seen', 'anyone', 'watched', '70', 'Show', 'Smith', 'was', 'able', 'erase', 'comedic', 'subtext', 'performance', 'give', 'raw', 'emotion', 'feel', 'bad', 'Robert', 'Sean', 'Leonard', 'matter', 'what', 'film', 'starring', 'face', 'was', 'star', 'had', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'Williams', 'always', 'outshined', 'supporting', 'players', 'Williams', 'was', 'disappointment', 'did', ""n't"", 'convey', 'same', 'ferocity', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'almost', 'other', 'performance', 'given', ""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'Williams', 'was', 'saddened', 'be', 'so', 'disappointed.I', 'was', 'discussing', 'movie', 'best', 'friend', 'other', 'day', 'was', 'saying', 'how', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'got', 'discussion', 'teacher/student', 'films', 'adaptation', 'years', 'Recent', 'films', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'one', 'personal', 'favorite', 'films', 'really', 'touched', 'deeper', 'level', 'just', 'progression', 'time', 'guess', 'not', 'say', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'Society', ""n't"", 'good', 'film', 'just', 'say', 'entertainment', 'progressed', 'point', 'where', 'become', 'more', 'good', 'film', 'great', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'long', 'time', 'come', 'what', 'long', 'run']",N/A

Happily, director Peter Weir, and writer Tom Schulman were attuned to the same  universal mindset,but then if you study a particular actor long enough, it's not hard to imagine roles in which he may excel.Williams brings only a little of his routine comic schtick to this part.In this 1989 release about life 30 years earlier, it is the beginning of a Vermont autumn. As the leaves turn, the incipience of a new term at the Welton Academy for Boys is marked, amid the reluctant young tears of boys being sent away from home for the first time, returning students reuniting with old friends, and a ceremony of banners and bagpipe music(specifically ""Scotland the Brave""), and the recital of the school credo, ""Tradition, Honor, Discipline, and Excellence"".In this world of high hopes for young men, Todd Anderson(Ethan Hawke) is a student who has a lot to live up to, as he is a school legacy whose older brother excelled there. The headmaster, Mr. Nolan(Norman Lloyd) reminds him of this fact.The main group of boys in this story, besides Todd Anderson include Knox Overstreet(Josh Charles), Steven Meeks(Allelon Ruggiero), Gerard Pitts( James Waterston), uberconformist Richard Cameron(Dylan Kussman), and Todd's roommate, Neil Perry(Robert Sean Leonard, giving a sensitive performance with a lot of range).There is a lot of foreshadowing in the early scenes where Neil's domineering father(Kurtwood Smith) lays down the agenda for his son's school year, harshly rebuking his son even for trying to state his case to divert from his ascribed course in the company of his friends. This embittered man, overly determined that his son take opportunities that life denied him, is destined to create a tragic outcome. We feel that Neil's mother(Carla Belver), who appears to be a repressed housewife typical of her era, might have been more willing to accept the course her son tried to chart for his own life.Enter Mr. Keating, who on his first day of class, calls his students from the seats in the classroom to the gallery, where they stand before photos of Welton alumni of a half-century earlier. Keating points out that they are all currently fertilizing daffodils and that his young charges must find ways to fulfill their own ambitions.""Make your lives extraordinary!"" he tells them.""Carpe diem!"" or ""Seize the day!"" becomes a motto for the students, and through various sessions of Keating's English classes, we watch him inspire his students to think outside the box as far as poetry and life are concerned.He does, however, point out the necessity of professions for which most of these students are destined.But he also tells them that while the professions they may one day enter sustain life, things such as poetry will help them celebrate and enjoy life.The boys soon get hold of Mr. Keating's old Welton yearbook,and discover his  membership in the mysterious ""Dead Poets Society"". When they ask him about it he is reluctant to discuss it and asks them to burn the documentation of his formative years.With a twinkle in his eye, Neil encourages his comrades to re-form the Dead Poets Society. Finding a way to escape the main building late at night, the boys convene in an Indian cave in the woods of the campus where they recite the works of dead poets such as Thoureau, Shakespeare, Byron, and Lindsay(having particular fun with the politically correct verses of the latter's ""The Congo""), and using the lessons presented by Keating to enrich their lives.Three cornerstone vignettes of this film are presented by the lovelorn Knox Overstreet in his romantic pursuit of a lovely cheerleader named Chris Noel(Alexandra Powers), Todd Anderson's uncertainty about expressing himself, and Neil's struggle to follow his own path in life despite his father's opposition.Along the way, the meetings of the club continue, and we view the students' academic regimen, the growing ire of Mr. Nolan and the establishment, who fail to realize their nonconformist English teacher is more of a realist in some ways than they are, a misguided act of rebellion, Todd's discovery of his own poetic abilities(coaxed out of him by Mr. Keating), and a lovely evening at the theater which will culminate in Neil's tragically short-lived triumph as Puck in ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"".The promising autumn at the beginning turns into the winter of students' discontent as they deal with a shattering loss and inquiries by the headmaster, who blinds himself to the truth about who was really responsible for the tragedy and makes Keating the scapegoat. Helping him in this endeavor is Richard Cameron, whose blind obedience to authority may cause one to envision him as a casualty in the Vietnam War a few years down the road.All may seem lost, but amid the legendary Maurice Jarre's stately and wistfully triumphant score, John Keating receives his final victory at the moment of his departure.The final deference of his loyal students is powerful, and he leaves with evidence of Todd's leadership abilities and knowing that he has made a difference in their lives. No teacher could ask for more.",5,Journeying Into the Woods,1284854400,"09 19, 2010",2010,5405,"['Interestingly', 'honor', 'bright', 'passionate', 'fan', 'Robin', 'Williams', '80s', 'had',

258601,A11PTCZ2FM2547,6301627768,"D. Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[5, 7]","Two reasons to like DEAD POETS SOCIETY.  First of all, there is a fundamental human component innate and inherent in all of us--that yearning to rebel, to ""stick it to the man"".  Secondly, instead of being his usual ADD, out-of-control maniacal self, Robin Williams is delightfully restrained (at least, for him) as the smirking John Keating, an English teacher who dares to teach outside the box of a conservative boys' prep school in the Fifties.  And he does the unthinkable--turns his young charges on to poetry, so much so that seven of them form their secret club, the Dead Poets Society.  As they gather in secret to pursue their bohemian pleasures, each of them goes on his own individual journey of self-discovery.Which, of course, is anathema to both school and parents.  A young man wishing to live his own life?  Pursue his own dreams?  How gauche!  We've seen this theme, over and over in countless stories:  once Authority is challenged, it cracks down vigorously.  Here, with the boys' disdain for such regimented authority causing unhappiness--even tragedy--Authority conveniently scapegoats Mr. Keating as the culprit.  And all of this leads to the film's climactic, triumphant ending, when Authority finally succumbs to the indomitable human spirit.  To say DEAD POETS SOCIETY has a feel-good ending is akin to saying accountants are boring.Again, Robin Williams is subdued, making him delightfully watchable and effective.  The young actors, led by Ethan Hawke and Robert Sean Leonard, are fun to watch, and interact most believably.  The plot is, alas, predictable, often bordering on purplish melodrama; but putting such inconveniences aside, DEAD POETS SOCIETY is engaging as it is engrossing.  Longfellow must be smiling.--D.

In my view these critics simply need to open themselves up a little more.The arrival of John Keating in a strict boys boarding school, blows open the lives and minds of all his young students. Perhaps this is where the film finds a place in the hearts of so many viewers. Many people will have spent their schooldays mired in tedium and waiting for someone to truly engage them. This is the gift that Mr. Keating bestows upon his students. The movie is a subtle, beautiful and moving examination of human relations.The movie works heavily with the idiom that still waters run deep.

258612,A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4,6301627768,Elisabeth,"[13, 26]","The messages in this movie are good -- don't be afraid to be a free thinker, a non-conformist, and someone who lives their life to the fullest (seizes the day) -- but the delivery came across as hypocritical.For example, in English class, the English teacher (played by Robin Williams) has the students rip up the pages of their poetry textbook simply because it was written by someone with a PhD.  He then has the students exclusively study poetry using his methods alone...as if his methods alone are the only ones that hold any merit.  During all this, he also stresses the importance of these students being free thinkers.However, if he REALLY wanted these students to be free thinkers, then he would've left the textbooks intact, allowing the opportunity to compare both methods of study if they desired.  This would allow the students to decide -- for themselves -- which method they preferred better.  But by limiting them to his way only, the teacher was actually stunting the students' ability to be free thinkers.This movie also preaches non-conformity, but what that really meant in this movie was not conforming to the traditional way of doing things.  But what if someone LIKES doing things the traditional way?  What if someone LIKES structure?  Then they're mocked for not conforming to the more liberal, spontaneous way of doing things.The best example of this is the redheaded student.  He clearly preferred doing things in a structured way and is mocked for it.  When he copies what the English teacher writes on the board, complete with ruler in hand, he looks like a fool because the teacher was really making a mockery of copying things off a board.  But just because it's not the teacher's way of learning, why does the student have to look like a fool for liking to learn this way?It's interesting that the students are all gung-ho about non-conformist thinking, but nonetheless have no problem pressuring this redhead to conform to their thinking.  When they all want to break curfew by sneaking out to a poetry reading, the redhead doesn't want to break the rules and get into trouble.  Instead of respecting his independent thinking, they pressure him to follow.Another message being preached here is living life to the fullest and seizing the day.  However, there didn't seem to be any limits with this.  For example, one student ""seized the day"" by going after another guy's girlfriend.  Instead of seeing his invasion into someone elses relationship as a narcissistic thing to do, it's seen as a brave thing to do.  Who cares if his actions are at the boyfriend's expense?  He's seizing the day!There's one scene where the English teacher does try to set limits, but he came across as a hypocrite for doing so.  The scene is when one student disrupts an assembly, gets in trouble for it, and is lectured by the English teacher to respect authority.This is the same teacher who disrespected authority by having students tear up the textbook assigned by the authorities, by breaking the teaching methods set up by the authorities, by influencing students to break curfew set up by authorities and by cracking jokes about authority.  What did he expect?He taught these students to defy and dismiss authority and yet, when his teaching methods inspire one student to publically defy and dismiss authority, he does a 180 and acts like he's against that kind of behavior.  But then...wanting to also be seen as a cool, hip teacher does another 180 by following his lecture with a joke that basically says, everything I just told you, you can dismiss.  So by doing a 360, his original teachings about defying and dismissing authority remain.The hypocrisy in this movie was not only evident in the teachings, but also in the portrayal of traditional thinkers.  All the traditional thinkers in this movie are portrayed as stuffy, intolerant and overbearing.  While these types of people do exist, there's no other sane traditional thinkers to balance out this view.  So what you're left with is a very limited, stereotypical view of traditional thinkers.  But...wasn't the point of this movie to broaden your mind and not cram people into limiting boxes?",2,Good messages delivered in a hypocritical way,1310515200,"07 13, 2011",2011,4174,"['messages', 'movie', 'are', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'afraid', 'be', 'free', 'thinker', 'non-conformist', 'someone', 'who', 'life', 'fullest', 'seizes', 'day', 'delivery', 'came', 'hypocritical.For', 'example', 'English', 'class', 'English', 'teacher', 'played', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'students', 'rip', 'up', 'pages', 'poetry', 'textbook', 'simply', 'was', 'written', 'someone', 'PhD', 'then', 'students', 'exclusively', 'study', 'poetry', 'using', 'methods', 'alone', 'methods', 'alone', 'are', 'only', 'ones', 'hold', 'merit', 'also', 'importance', 'students', 'being', 'free', 'thinkers.However', 'REALLY', 'wanted', 'students', 'be', 'free', 'thinkers', 'then', 'would', ""'ve"", 'left', 'textbooks', 'intact', 'allowing', 'opportunity', 'compare', 'methods', 'study', 'desired', 'would', 'allow', 'students', 'decide', 'method', 'preferred', 'better', 'limiting', 'way', 'only', 'teacher', 'was', 'actually', 'stunting', 'students', 'ability', 'be', 'free', 'thinkers.This', 'movie', 'also', 'non-conformity', 'what', 'really', 'meant', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'conforming', 'traditional', 'way', 'doing', 'things', 'what', 'someone', 'LIKES', 'doing', 'things', 'traditional', 'way', 'What', 'someone', 'LIKES', 'structure', 'Then', ""'re"", 'mocked', 'not', 'conforming', 'more', 'liberal', 'spontaneous', 'way', 'doing', 'things.The', 'best', 'example', 'redheaded', 'student', 'clearly', 'preferred', 'doing', 'things', 'structured', 'way', 'mocked', 'When', 'what', 'English', 'teacher', 'board', 'complete', 'ruler', 'hand', 'fool', 'teacher', 'was', 'really', 'making', 'mockery', 'copying', 'things', 'off', 'board', 'just', 'not', 'teacher', 'way', 'learning', 'why', 'student', 'have', 'look', 'fool', 'liking', 'learn', 'way', 'interesting', 'students', 'are', 'gung-ho', 'non-conformist', 'thinking', 'nonetheless', 'have', 'problem', 'pressuring', 'redhead', 'conform', 'thinking', 'When', 'want', 'break', 'curfew', 'sneaking', 'out', 'poetry', 'reading', 'redhead', ""n't"", 'want', 'break', 'rules', 'get', 'trouble', 'Instead', 'respecting', 'independent', 'thinking', 'pressure', 'follow.Another', 'message', 'being', 'preached', 'here', 'living', 'life', 'fullest', 'seizing', 'day', 'However', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'limits', 'example', 'one', 'student', 'seized', 'day', 'going', 'guy', 'girlfriend', 'Instead', 'seeing', 'invasion', 'someone', 'relationship', 'narcissistic', 'thing', 'do', 'seen', 'brave', 'thing', 'do', 'Who', 'actions', 'are', 'boyfriend', 'expense', 'seizing', 'day', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'English', 'teacher', 'try', 'set', 'limits', 'came', 'across', 'hypocrite', 'doing', 'so', 'scene', 'when', 'one', 'student', 'assembly', 'trouble', 'lectured', 'English', 'teacher', 'respect', 'authority.This', 'same', 'teacher', 'who', 'disrespected', 'authority', 'having', 'students', 'tear', 'up', 'textbook', 'assigned', 'authorities', 'breaking', 'teaching', 'methods', 'set', 'up', 'authorities', 'influencing', 'students', 'break', 'curfew', 'set', 'up', 'authorities', 'cracking', 'jokes', 'authority', 'What', 'did', 'expect', 'taught', 'students', 'defy', 'dismiss', 'authority', 'yet', 'when', 'teaching', 'methods', 'inspire', 'one', 'student', 'publically', 'defy', 'dismiss', 'authority', '180', 'acts', 'kind', 'behavior', 'then', 'wanting', 'also', 'be', 'seen', 'cool', 'hip', 'teacher', '180', 'following', 'lecture', 'joke', 'basically', 'everything', 'just', 'told', 'can', 'dismiss', 'So', 'doing', '360', 'original', 'teachings', 'defying', 'dismissing', 'authority', 'remain.The', 'hypocrisy', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'evident', 'teachings', 'also', 'portrayal', 'traditional', 'thinkers', 'traditional', 'thinkers', 'movie', 'are', 'portrayed', 'stuffy', 'intolerant', 'overbearing', 'types', 'people', 'do', 'exist', 'other', 'sane', 'traditional', 'thinkers', 'balance', 'out', 'view', 'what', ""'re"", 'left', 'very', 'limited', 'stereotypical', 'view', 'traditional', 'thinkers', 'was', ""n't"", 'point', 'movie', 'broaden', 'mind', 'not', 'cram', 'people', 'limiting', 'boxes']",N/A

Dead Poets Society is about an English teacher who adores poetry and has such a passion and enthusiasm for it that he infects his students with this drive to live life to the fullest based off of the preachings of transcendentalist authors such as Thoreau and Whitman.  The students he teaches, a group of boys from a private school that is locked down within uniformity, religion, and discipline, are all stunned at Mr. Keating's teaching methods, but soon begin to laugh and enjoy themselves.As with any group of people, some follow suit very closely, while others fear to leave the comforts of conformity.  Although teaching students to live outside the box can be dangerous, it is also liberating and exalting for the students to gain a new perspective on life.  The film teaches us to inspire, to create, to enjoy, and to never let the driving force of conformity hold us into a mold that is not our own.  We must walk our own walk, and be our own being.Robin Williams steals the show with his passionate role of Mr. Keating and we feel for the students he teaches to seize the day.

Robin Williams does a brilliant job in his role as a semi-bohemian poetry teacher with a passion for challenging orthodoxy.  As mentioned so many times by past reviewers, Ethan Hawke's performance is similarly powerful, as are those of the other boys.  Sets and cinematography deserve praise too, for capturing the ""feel"" not only of the school but the era in which it is set.  The script is superb as well.  It captures all the angst felt by the young men as they begin to question the world they have been thrust into and their places in it.I have long wondered whether what Keating did for the boys was on whole positive or negative, and I can see cogent arguments for both.  On one hand it was obvious they were being trained to be little more than financially successful conformists in a staid, deadly dull world.On the other, ""free"" thought isn't necessarily the same as good thought.  All one need do is survey some of the opinion boards on AOL or other sites to see that many, many people voice opinions based almost entirely on emotion and personal prejudice.  They use few if any real thinking skills and commit one error after another in their posts; common examples are ad hominem attacks, circular reasoning and the straw man fallacy.Such opinions reveal nothing but the poster's ignorance and unwillingness to consider any opinions contrary to their own, yet I am sure that they would defend their remarks using terms like ""free thought.""  This does not change the fact that they contribute nothing to the debate.In short, dissent is a fine thing if it is grounded in well constructed arguments; a historic example is the Declaration of Independence, which outlines the reasons America sought independence from Great Britain.

258625,A2UBSGFCP2QFNV,6301627768,"Greg Ehrbar ""'MouseTracksOnline'""","[10, 11]","It is arguable that Dead Poet's Society can be called Robin Williams' best film, or his best performance, but doing so only diminishes much of his other impressive work on film and television (and for those lucky enough to have seen him, on stage). I would go as far as to say that Dead Poet's Society is probably the best dramatic film from the heydey of Disney's then-emerging Touchstone division.The film's audio commentary (thank you!) is chock full of interesting facts. Screenwriter Tom Schulman talks about how several studio executives held a meeting in which they were going to go over pages of ""notes"" with endless comments and changes -- then Jeffrey Katzenberg glanced through the pages and told Schulman to go ahead and make the film as written.The finished film is the subject of some discourse, because what we saw in the theaters back in 1989 is shorter than what appeared on the ""director's cut"" on laserdisc. Several of the edited scenes (perhaps not all, I'm not sure) are available on the special features section of the Blu-ray. You can make your own decision about whether these scenes should have stayed, but to me, the movie that I saw and never forgot in 1989 is the film as presented here.Except that when I saw it, the film did not look or sound like it does on this Blu-ray. Director Peter Weir is a very contemplative filmmaker, prone to capturing scenery and moments that establish various moods. Many of these extraordinarily beautiful scenes of Delaware in the fall and winter are downright dazzling on Blu-ray.Back to the movie itself, though -- it has not lost any of its impact in the ensuing years. Williams' character of Prof. Keating is not the hellbent-for-conflict hummingbird he played in Good Morning Vietnam (though in Dead Poet's Society, he gets just a few minutes to do some of his iconic shtick). There is amazing depth in his silence as well as his inspiring speech, almost an internal battle between what life can be and what life has dealt him (even though we get little hint of that in the narrative).Every member of the cast rises to the occasion, particularly one of the best actors now on television, Robert Sean Leonard, who artfully plays the best (only?) friend of Hugh Laurie in the long-running series, House.One of the most thankless performances in the movie is that of Kurtwood Smith, also handled masterfully: as Leonard's immovable father, brings dimension to a very unlikable role. Again, that draws attention to how different an edited film can be from a director's cut -- there is one deleted scene between Smith and Williams from the last act that, had it remained, would have made a huge difference in the perception of both characters. It's helpful that we get a featurette on the bonus materials (clearly from an earlier DVD) in which the creative people discuss how they approached the challenges.Weir explains that he deliberately avoided clear-cut answers in the film. Keating tells young, impressionable teens to reach beyond their grasp, as did the legendary people he quotes. He doesn't warn them that those visionaries paid their prices in one way or another. When some of these teens take chances, only some succeed, just as in real life. Is it worth it? What a great discussion this opens for parents and their kids.In its context of late-1950's McCarthyism, perched at the edge of cultural revolution in the '60s, Keating is an outspoken voice before it was cool. In today's world of extremes from one spectrum of propriety to another, as well as political correctness, one might wonder how he would fare.",5,"""SEIZE THE BLU-RAY!""",1327622400,"01 27, 2012",2012,3586,"['arguable', 'Dead', 'Poet', 'Society', 'can', 'be', 'called', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'best', 'film', 'best', 'performance', 'doing', 'so', 'only', 'much', 'other', 'impressive', 'work', 'film', 'television', 'lucky', 'enough', 'have', 'seen', 'stage', 'would', 'go', 'as', 'far', 'say', 'Dead', 'Poet', 'Society', 'probably', 'best', 'dramatic', 'film', 'heydey', 'Disney', 'then-emerging', 'Touchstone', 'division.The', 'film', 'audio', 'commentary', 'chock', 'full', 'interesting', 'facts', 'Screenwriter', 'Tom', 'Schulman', 'talks', 'how', 'several', 'studio', 'executives', 'held', 'meeting', 'were', 'going', 'go', 'pages', 'notes', 'endless', 'comments', 'changes', 'then', 'Jeffrey', 'Katzenberg', 'glanced', 'pages', 'told', 'Schulman', 'go', 'ahead', 'make', 'film', 'written.The', 'finished', 'film', 'subject', 'discourse', 'what', 'saw', 'theaters', 'back', '1989', 'shorter', 'what', 'appeared', 'director', 'cut', 'laserdisc', 'Several', 'edited', 'scenes', 'perhaps', 'not', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'are', 'available', 'special', 'features', 'section', 'Blu-ray', 'can', 'make', 'own', 'decision', 'scenes', 'should', 'have', 'stayed', 'movie', 'saw', 'never', 'forgot', '1989', 'film', 'presented', 'here.Except', 'when', 'saw', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'look', 'sound', 'Blu-ray', 'Director', 'Peter', 'Weir', 'very', 'contemplative', 'filmmaker', 'prone', 'capturing', 'scenery', 'moments', 'establish', 'various', 'moods', 'Many', 'extraordinarily', 'beautiful', 'scenes', 'Delaware', 'fall', 'winter', 'are', 'downright', 'dazzling', 'Blu-ray.Back', 'movie', 'though', 'not', 'lost', 'impact', 'ensuing', 'years', 'Williams', 'character', 'Prof.', 'Keating', 'not', 'hellbent-for-conflict', 'hummingbird', 'played', 'Good', 'Morning', 'Vietnam', 'Dead', 'Poet', 'Society', 'just', 'few', 'minutes', 'do', 'iconic', 'shtick', 'amazing', 'depth', 'silence', 'as', 'well', 'inspiring', 'speech', 'almost', 'internal', 'battle', 'what', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'what', 'life', 'dealt', 'even', 'get', 'little', 'hint', 'narrative', '.Every', 'member', 'cast', 'occasion', 'particularly', 'one', 'best', 'actors', 'now', 'television', 'Robert', 'Sean', 'Leonard', 'who', 'artfully', 'best', 'only', 'friend', 'Hugh', 'Laurie', 'long-running', 'series', 'House.One', 'most', 'thankless', 'performances', 'movie', 'Kurtwood', 'Smith', 'also', 'handled', 'masterfully', 'Leonard', 'immovable', 'father', 'dimension', 'very', 'unlikable', 'role', 'Again', 'attention', 'how', 'different', 'edited', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'director', 'cut', 'one', 'deleted', 'scene', 'Smith', 'Williams', 'last', 'act', 'had', 'remained', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'huge', 'difference', 'perception', 'characters', 'helpful', 'get', 'featurette', 'bonus', 'materials', 'clearly', 'earlier', 'DVD', 'creative', 'people', 'discuss', 'how', 'approached', 'challenges.Weir', 'deliberately', 'avoided', 'clear-cut', 'answers', 'film', 'Keating', 'tells', 'young', 'impressionable', 'teens', 'reach', 'grasp', 'did', 'legendary', 'people', ""n't"", 'warn', 'visionaries', 'paid', 'prices', 'one', 'way', 'When', 'teens', 'take', 'chances', 'only', 'succeed', 'just', 'real', 'life', 'What', 'great', 'discussion', 'parents', 'kids.In', 'context', 'late-1950', 'McCarthyism', 'perched', 'edge', 'cultural', 'revolution', ""'60s"", 'Keating', 'outspoken', 'voice', 'was', 'cool', 'today', 'world', 'extremes', 'one', 'spectrum', 'propriety', 'as', 'well', 'political', 'correctness', 'one', 'might', 'wonder', 'how', 'would', 'fare']",N/A
258626,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,6301627768,Gregor von Kallahann,"[1, 3]","As much as I'd like to deny it, I think I've always suffered, to some degree, from a kind of ""prep school envy.""  Maybe it comes from having read A SEPARATE PEACE as a teenager--or for that matter, A CATCHER IN THE RYE, which in its own perverse way, still makes going to a private school more romantic and somehow fulfilling (even to the extent of making rebellion against it all the more appealing).  Wherever the appeal of prep school mythology may lie, I doubt that I'm alone in succumbing to it. There's an inherent appeal to our inner adolescent of a life away from home and family, of dealing with adult authority figures who are not relatives (and therefore seemingly all the easier to outwit), and of simply being part of a KIND of elite, which is probably universal.  It certainly seems to be a big part of the appeal of the HARRY POTTER series, which, when you get right down to it, is yet another private school romance once you take away the supernatural trappings.It's easy then to identify with the excitement and nervous anticipation at the prospect of a new school year that all the students seem to be exhibiting in the opening scenes of DEAD POETS SOCIETY.  Of course, you also realize that there are below-the-surface issues that many of the boys are dealing with, not the least of which, of course, are the high demands and expectations of the parents who are footing the bill and whose ambitions for their sons (and this is the '50s, so we are talking SONS here) almost assuredly will not quite jibe with their progeny's actual dreams.Indeed as to be expected, the dreams of the two youths most readily identifiable as protagonists, are much loftier and more elevated than the socially ambitious fantasies of their parents seem to be.  We have the young aspriring actor (Robert Sean Leonard, who was indeed quite a young and aspiring actor at the time) whose tyrannical father is pushing towards a career in medicine, and sensitive newcomer (Ethan Hawke), who is suffering under the yoke of being brother of a former valedictorian and who we know is going to grow up to be a writer, even if he never quite articulates this as his life's goal.  We also can assume that their dreams will be both nurtured and nearly quashed at the hands of the various adults in their lives (parents, teachers and administrators).  On the good guy side of that equation, we have inspiring new teacher, John Keating (a somewhat reined-in Robin Williams) and on the bad guy end of things, we have veteran actor Norman Lloyd as the school's villainous headmaster, Mr. Nolan (and to think, he was such a sweet old guy as Dr. Auschlander on TV's ST. ELSEWHERE--you never can tell).If it sounds like the deck is stacked and that the players are clearly black and white, well, that's sorta true.  At its heart DEAD POETS SOCIETY is your basic ""misunderstood youth/insensitive-intransigent adult drama,"" and that's unfortunate, because 1989, the year of the film's release, something a bit richer, a bit more subtle COULD have been told and successfully sold.  Considering Norman Lloyd's considerable talent, for instance, it would not have been unreasonable to have the school's chief administrator express at least a few private doubts about the kinds of rigidly disciplinary actions he's more or less forced to do.There are, in fact, a few moments where the ""good student/bad adult"" schema is successfully shaded, just enough,in fact, to make you wish for more.  When Mr. Keating's unconventional teaching methods are just beginning to come to light, he is gently criticized by a fellow teacher, who seems less reproving than nostalgic for his own younger, more idealistic self.  That's the kind of small moment that can make or break a drama, and unfortunately, there are just too few of them in this film.Nearly every review I've read of DPS mentions that Robin Williams' part is actually surprisingly small.  His relationship to his students is actually NOT that close a one, as it turns out--although when the administration decides to railroad him, they certainly imply that his influence on the boys has been outsize.  And it certainly isn't true that he encourages that the students ""revive"" the secret literary society he had himself been a member of during his own years at the school.  In reality, he doesn't even seem to be aware that his old club HAS been revived, let alone act as any kind of advisor to the group.  We do know that the boys have somehow come into possession of something like a procedures manual for the meetings, so perhaps Keating was at least aware of their interest in a reviving a group that seems to have disbanded some 17 or 18 years before.  but beyond being their initial inspiration, the idealistic new teacher seems to have nothing to do with the current group.If the kids vs. adult conflict is something of a hoary old cinematic trope, so too is that of the idealistic, inspirational teacher.  Admittedly, if anyone is going to bring something new to this readymade character type, it'd be Robin Williams.  But Williams has to tread a narrow line here.  He can't be his manic stand-up self, obviously, but he has to bring enough of that craziness to his character to make his iconoclasm and the enthusiasm it generates among the students somewhat plausible.  I'm not sure that imitating John Wayne and Marlon Brando doing Shakespeare is the best way to suggest his character's uniqueness.  It seems like every Robin Williams film has to give him his Robin Williams moment, however, whether it makes dramatic sense or not.  I suppose you could argue that a teacher gifted enough at impressions of the day's most famous actors could get a rise out of his students by mimicking Brando and Wayne in 1959.  But it still seems like Robin Williams doing his schtick in *1989*.If Keating seems doomed to fail in this buttoned down setting,  it is not clear from the get go.  For the longest time, it seems that his unconventional methods are indeed being tolerated, and that may be the point.  He is only railroaded out when tragedy occurs (the suicide of a student who, we can clearly see, is actually the victim of his own father's relentless demands) and the school needs tofind a scapegoat.  It may be that he would have been fired anyway, or it may be that his non-conformity would have continued to be tolerated on some level if the waves he was making never quite reached tsunami strength.Bottom line: yes, the movie is worth watching.  The talent behind it (director, Peter Weir, cast members: Williams, Leonard, Hawke and just about the entire cast really) is considerable.  But the good moments are just enough to make you wish the whole enterprise could have been better.  I've always admired director Weir, but he seems to have dropped the ball here.  I'm not sure if limitations in the script were partially to blame, but at this point in his career, Weir was certainly enough of an auteur to have pulled rank, order some rewrites and do things in his own distinctive way.",3,Seize The Semester!,1293580800,"12 29, 2010",2010,7017,"['As', 'much', ""'d"", 'like', 'deny', 'think', ""'ve"", 'always', 'suffered', 'degree', 'kind', 'prep', 'school',

However, what more can I add to that?  Hopefully, something useful, if not entertaining.It was almost uncanny.  I was at a used book-store years ago.  I came across an old yearbook from  Wooster University in Wooster, Ohio.  It is from 1936.  Mint condition.  The price was $1.50.  That's right, one dollar and fifty cents.  I  purchased it with no hesitation.Looking at those pictures, of people  most likely long deceased, &quot;Dead Poets' Society&quot; came to mind.  &quot;Carpe Diem&quot; and the lives of these people brought to reality.  Each individual, captured for eternity in an array of poses.  One lad, with  his cap and goggles, posed dashingly on his motorcycle (an incredibly  gorgeous 1930-ish Indian motorcycle).  The girls, in lovely sweaters and  skirts, looking unabashedly like the Andrews Sisters.  The gents, most in  bowlers, wire rimmed glasses, etc....strikingly handsome.  &quot;Trying  hard to look like Gary Cooper&quot; as it were.  Or at least a young  Frankie.  All exuding a sense of innocence and naivete, in a pre-WWII  world.  At least, before things really started getting heated in  Europe.What did these kids acheive in their lives?  Was it what they  wanted?  Was it what they expected?  Are they even missed?  Which ones were  lovers?  How many found their love?  How many were shipped off to the Great  War, and lost their lives/loves?This movie brings to life the images,  and stories, of youth.  Of casting away all preconceived (or even,  brainwashed) ideas of what should and should not be.  Of being an  individual.  Experiencing life.  Experiencing the tragedy of what can  happen when the forces of the world won't let you have that experience.  (Those who have seen the movie know the tragedy of which I refer.)It is  an incredibly powerful movie.  One that is uplifting and depressing at the  same time.  But, inasmuch as it carries such a feeling with it, it also  inspires.  It inspires you to live your life to the fullest, to experience  life and love.  It also affirms that life need not be what others say it  should be.Perhaps this is much too deep, or maybe it's a bunch of  psuedo-intellectual non-sense (&quot;mumbo-jumbo&quot; my grandmother would  say).  I don't know, and who am I to say?  Just, whatever the general vibe  maybe that you got from the story about the yearbook, and lives lived and  lost, that's the jist of this movie.Robin Williams in one of his  finest roles, if not &quot;the&quot; finest role of his life.",5,"Moving, enchanting...",966816000,"08 21, 2000",2000,2597,"['really', 'surprise', 'see', 'are', 'already', 'well', '120', 'reviews', 'written', 'one', 'However', 'what', 'more', 'can', 'add', 'Hopefully', 'something', 'useful', 'not', 'entertaining.It', 'was', 'almost', 'uncanny', 'was', 'used', 'book-store', 'years', 'ago', 'came', 'old', 'yearbook', 'Wooster', 'University', 'Wooster', 'Ohio', '1936', 'Mint', 'condition', 'price', 'was', '1.50', 'right', 'one', 'dollar', 'fifty', 'cents', 'purchased', 'hesitation.Looking', 'pictures', 'people', 'most', 'likely', 'long', 'deceased', 'quot', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'Society', 'quot', 'came', 'mind', 'quot', 'Carpe', 'Diem', 'quot', 'lives', 'people', 'brought', 'reality', 'individual', 'captured', 'eternity', 'array', 'poses', 'One', 'lad', 'cap', 'goggles', 'posed', 'dashingly', 'motorcycle', 'incredibly', 'gorgeous', '1930-ish', 'Indian', 'motorcycle', 'girls', 'lovely', 'sweaters', 'skirts', 'looking', 'unabashedly', 'Andrews', 'Sisters', 'gents', 'most', 'bowlers', 'wire', 'rimmed', 'glasses', 'etc', '.strikingly', 'handsome', 'quot', 'Trying', 'hard', 'look', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'quot', 'were', 'least', 'young', 'Frankie', 'exuding', 'sense', 'innocence', 'naivete', 'pre-WWII', 'world', 'least', 'things', 'really', 'started', 'getting', 'heated', 'Europe.What', 'did', 'kids', 'acheive', 'lives', 'Was', 'what', 'wanted', 'Was', 'what', 'expected', 'Are', 'even', 'missed', 'Which', 'ones', 'were', 'lovers', 'How', 'many', 'found', 'love', 'How', 'many', 'were', 'shipped', 'off', 'Great', 'War', 'lost', 'lives/loves', 'movie', 'life', 'images', 'stories', 'youth', 'casting', 'away', 'preconceived', 'even', 'brainwashed', 'ideas', 'what', 'should', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'being', 'individual', 'Experiencing', 'life', 'Experiencing', 'tragedy', 'what', 'can', 'happen', 'when', 'forces', 'world', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'have', 'experience', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'know', 'tragedy', 'refer', 'incredibly', 'powerful', 'movie', 'One', 'uplifting', 'depressing', 'same', 'time', 'inasmuch', 'feeling', 'also', 'live', 'life', 'fullest', 'experience', 'life', 'love', 'also', 'life', 'need', 'not', 'be', 'what', 'others', 'say', 'should', 'be.Perhaps', 'much', 'too', 'deep', 'maybe', 'bunch', 'psuedo-intellectual', 'non-sense', 'quot', 'mumbo-jumbo', 'quot', 'grandmother', 'would', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'am', 'say', 'Just', 'general', 'vibe', 'maybe', 'got', 'story', 'yearbook', 'lived', 'lost', 'jist', 'movie.Robin', 'Williams', 'one', 'finest', 'roles', 'not', 'quot', 'quot', 'finest', 'role', 'life']",N/A

Many students simply ignore Keating, but a few are taken with his message of free thinking. Two students, roommates, Neil and Todd (Robert Sean Leonard and Ethan Hawke) become ardent followers of Keating's Carpe Diem philosophy. But Neil's father has other plans for him. He is, in fact, stealing a second life from Neil and doing, via his son, what he wished he'd done.

A new English teacher soon changes all of that.The teachers shows the boys that they can accomplish more in life by taking logistic chances and by living freely.

The English teacher infused a spirit of joy in the boys, a desire to wonder at the world once more, a longing to seize the day. The subsequent courage of the boys was admirable and thrilling.My only worry about the movie is the apparent disregard for tradition and discipline. Poetry and romantic thoughts are all good and well, but it must not be insinuated that tradition or order or that sort of thing hinders true joy. Many times binding rules and stifling systems unintentionally keep students down, depressed, and bored, but that is not the nature of tradition. True reverence for history, parents, and all that rot should be a source of wisdom and encouragement, an encouragement toward the life of excitement and exploration.Having said all that, the movie is good to strike out against the boring sort of authority that doesn't recognize the possibility of excitement in life. But usually authority is not of that nature, and should be honored as such. So have fun honoring authority! Put a tack on the teacher's chair in deference to them.

""Dead poets"" is one of the most sensitive and gripping movies in recent years.Robin Williams is the new literature teacher in a most conservative and old-fashioned prep-school in the 50s. His unorthodox methods of teaching bring most of his students close to him, while the school board worries a bit more each day. In his classes, professor Keating makes the young boys not only understand and enjoy poetry, but also to understand how to make life worthwile, in society and as individuals (carpe diem).I think there really is no central characters in the movie, since the exceptionally written script and subtle but eloquent directing by Peter Weir give life to many people, professor, students, fathers, deans, etc, each one with believable dialogues and motivations.Seen now, 15 years after its original release date, somethings might seem stereotyped, even cheesy, but maybe this is just a ""big picture"" of a part of the american white high/middle-class society at the end of the fifties (I don't know, I wasn't there).

We all know the film is awsome and anyone that already has the DVD already likes it, and may find some newer fans as well.  When I first placed the disc in my player I was hoping for a huge upgrade, but being the fact the movie did debut in 1989 you can only expect so much and not wanting to alter the directors intentions.  I was hoping for a directors cut with some of the TV or deleted scenes added back into the flick especially the funeral scene.My only disapointment it seems some of the scenes still are a bit fuzzy, some of the background shots also show alot of film grain.  The majority of the film is a nice improvment to the Sp. Ed. DVD from 2006.  The DTS HD Master Audio sounds great, not that is is a huge rear channel and sub audio film, alot of the music really stands out.  As mentioned by other reviewers the outdoor scenes are really clear.  I guess when your a big fan of a particuliar movie you are always wanting more and it will never be enough.  I really apprecited the upgrades, just thought we might of gotten more since so much information can go on a Blu-Ray.  I was hoping for innerviews from all cast members for this year and a bit more clean up of the picture.  I did read other industry reviews that stated that they were trying to leave intact the directors visions, I understand that, also it is a catelogue tittle, and most of those don't get the royal treatment.  If you are a new fan I highly recomend this film, It will inspire you and grab at your soul.  For those that already love this film, I am sure you will appreciate the uprgraded picture and sound.  I was just hoping for some added special features and a little better transfer.  You will see a scene of complete clarity and some grainy scense that show it is a bit fuzzy in the background and in the actors faces.  For its age it is pretty dam good.

He has an exceptional gift for these types of dramatic roles, his clown like ways masking a depth and sensitivity underneath.Using poetry as his tool, his challenge of conservative, narrow minded teaching methods and philosophy not surprisingly does not sit well with his peers. His rebellious attitude, passion for his job and caring, does however, have a profound impact on his students. This impact sparks a series of events which ultimately end in an unforseen tragedy and devastating school scandal. As a result Keating is made the the fall guy and political scapegoat, and athough his career takes a severe blow as result, his efforts have not been in vain, his inspiring legacy not lost.It's one of Robyn Williams's finest outings, and although as a teacher myself I would find the larger than life 'Hollywood version' of the Keating character hard to live up to, this film  brings home its message in a most effective and powerful way.",5,"''Oh Captain, my Captain''",1135728000,"12 28, 2005",2005,1940,"['Oh', 'Captain', 'Captain', 'very', 'words', 'now', 'always', 'move', 'goosebumps', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'ending', 'will', 'show', 'why', 'one', 'great', 'very', 'inspiring', 'memorable', 'cinematic', 'moments', 'Even', 'synopsis', 'movie', 'place', 'toffy', 'nosed', ""'male"", 'centred', 'world', 'American', ""'Ivy"", 'League', 'school', 'Harvard', 'wan', 'na', 'be', 'hard', 'relate', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'love', 'Regardless', 'setting', 'just', 'luuuvvv', 'message', 'do', 'what', 'want', 'life', 'passion', 'conviction', 'think', 'square', 'follow', 'dreams', 'own', 'mind', 'seize', 'day..', 'make', 'lives', 'extraordinary', 'also', 're-ignite', 'power', 'Arts', 'Literature', 'education', 'reminding', 'art', 'poetry', 'know', 'are', 'truly', 'alive', 'also', 'love', 'Robyn', 'Williams', 'performance', 'own', 'charisma', 'distinctive', 'humour', 'role', 'real', 'life', 'uncoventional', 'school', 'teacher', ""'John"", 'Keating', 'exceptional', 'gift', 'types', 'dramatic', 'roles', 'clown', 'ways', 'masking', 'depth', 'sensitivity', 'underneath.Using', 'poetry', 'tool', 'challenge', 'conservative', 'narrow', 'minded', 'teaching', 'methods', 'philosophy', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'not', 'sit', 'well', 'peers', 'rebellious', 'attitude', 'passion', 'job', 'caring', 'however', 'have', 'profound', 'impact', 'students', 'impact', 'series', 'events', 'ultimately', 'end', 'unforseen', 'tragedy', 'devastating', 'school', 'scandal', 'result', 'Keating', 'made', 'fall', 'guy', 'political', 'scapegoat', 'career', 'severe', 'blow', 'result', 'efforts', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'vain', 'inspiring', 'legacy', 'not', 'lost.It', 'one', 'Robyn', 'Williams', 'finest', 'outings', 'teacher', 'myself', 'would', 'find', 'larger', 'life', 'version', 'Keating', 'character', 'hard', 'live', 'up', 'film', 'home', 'message', 'most', 'effective', 'powerful', 'way']",N/A

It's about this teacher at an all-boys boarding school, who has &#34;unconventional&#34; ways of teaching. In that nutshell, this would be fine. BUT this teacher prompted these boys to disobey authority (breaking darn near all of the rules of the place), turn away from their parents and one boy even committed suicide! Now, I understand that all of this is supposed to be symbolic of these boys creating their own way, figuring out what THEY believe versus what those in authority are &#34;making&#34; them believe, but I see this as turning these kids away from their source of peace - their parents - and unnecessarily shaking their foundation. In the case of the boy who committed suicide, he was just fine doing what his parents told him to do, knowing that all he had to do was finish school and then he would be done with them - but no, the teacher invoked this &#34;live in the moment&#34; crap that made this boy feel like life wasn't worth living another 3 - 5 years (when he would be somewhere around 18) if he couldn't do what he wanted to do. The teacher just left those kids not trusting any adults around them (except him, of course) and that is harmful. He took away their security for no good reason. So, yeah...

I was privledged enough to be surrounded by teachers who taught me to be whatever I wanted to be and to reach for the stars.  Nearly 25 years later, I am older and more jaded and rather disappointed with the world around me.  But this movie provided what is so lacking in a world of domination, apathy and disorganization.Robin Williams in what was perhaps his finest role EVER is Mr. Keating, a rather eccentric and engaging new English teacher at the stiff upper lipped Welton Academy in the 1950s.  This is before the swinging 60s really began, and there was little to no sense of what we now know today as ""youth culture"".  Instead of his ADD hyperactivity comedy that we are used to seeing, Williams is a delightful breath of fresh air in this stuffy boys' academy.  Instead of sticking to the text and demanding like the rest of the staff, he engages his students into dreaming, thinking and awakening their inner artistic selves.  He uses poetry to shape their perceptions of themselves, encouraging even the most insecure of students (a very young Ethan Hawke) to come out of their shells and think for themselves.  Soon the boys are embracing their inner feelings through his words.  They even restart the Dead Poet's Society, a club that Williams began during his days at the same academy that met in secret, reading poetry in the caves near school grounds.It takes a dark turn, however, when ernest, supressed Neil decides to try out for a play, something he always wanted to do despite his unforgiving, harsh father.  When Neil gets the part, he is overjoyed.  And then his father finds out.  The notion of ""sticking it to the man"" is there, like we all do at some point, the adolescent rebellion was prominent no matter what you like to say.This is a joyous movie, filled with laughter and tears and the most unsappy coming of age story I have ever experienced.  It rings just as true today as it did back then.  I was fortunate enough to have been surrounded by just such teachers, who told me that I could reach for the stars and be whatever I wanted to be.  As an adult, however, we are met with a million disappointments and depressing things, when we realize the apathy, illiteracy and how little others truly care about themselves or others around them.  You CAN build your castle in the sky.  You CAN achieve whatever it is that you want.  You CAN make your dreams come true, but be warned that you are in the minority on this.  Being a dreamer AND a doer takes HARD WORK, as well as capital, as well as a certain risk taking that we are not always ready to do.  If the answer is no, the answer is no.  If the answer is yes, then GO GET IT and don't let whatever it is stop you from achieving that dream.",5,I have built my castle in the sky,1338854400,"06 5, 2012",2012,2804,"['THis', 'was', 'beloved', 'movie', 'youth', 'one', 'still', 'treasure', 'day', 'was', 'privledged', 'enough', 'be', 'surrounded', 'teachers', 'who', 'taught', 'be', 'wanted', 'be', 'reach', 'stars', 'Nearly', '25', 'years', 'later', 'am', 'older', 'more', 'jaded', 'rather', 'disappointed', 'world', 'movie', 'provided', 'what', 'so', 'lacking', 'world', 'domination', 'apathy', 'disorganization.Robin', 'Williams', 'what', 'was', 'perhaps', 'finest', 'role', 'EVER', 'Mr.', 'Keating', 'rather', 'eccentric', 'engaging', 'new', 'English', 'teacher', 'stiff', 'upper', 'lipped', 'Welton', 'Academy', '1950s', 'swinging', '60s', 'really', 'began', 'was', 'little', 'sense', 'what', 'now', 'know', 'today', 'youth', 'culture', 'Instead', 'ADD', 'hyperactivity', 'comedy', 'are', 'used', 'seeing', 'Williams', 'delightful', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'stuffy', 'boys', 'academy', 'Instead', 'sticking', 'text', 'demanding', 'rest', 'staff', 'students', 'dreaming', 'thinking', 'awakening', 'inner', 'artistic', 'selves', 'poetry', 'shape', 'perceptions', 'encouraging', 'even', 'most', 'insecure', 'students', 'very', 'young', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'come', 'shells', 'think', 'Soon', 'boys', 'are', 'embracing', 'inner', 'feelings', 'words', 'even', 'restart', 'Dead', 'Poet', 'Society', 'club', 'Williams', 'began', 'days', 'same', 'academy', 'met', 'secret', 'reading', 'poetry', 'caves', 'school', 'grounds.It', 'dark', 'turn', 'however', 'when', 'ernest', 'supressed', 'Neil', 'decides', 'try', 'out', 'play', 'something', 'always', 'wanted', 'do', 'unforgiving', 'harsh', 'father', 'When', 'Neil', 'part', 'overjoyed', 'then', 'father', 'out', 'notion', 'sticking', 'man', 'there', 'do', 'point', 'adolescent', 'rebellion', 'was', 'prominent', 'matter', 'what', 'like', 'say.This', 'joyous', 'movie', 'filled', 'laughter', 'tears', 'most', 'unsappy', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'have', 'ever', 'experienced', 'just', 'true', 'today', 'did', 'back', 'then', 'was', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'have', 'been', 'surrounded', 'just', 'such', 'teachers', 'who', 'told', 'could', 'reach', 'stars', 'be', 'wanted', 'be', 'adult', 'however', 'are', 'met', 'million', 'disappointments', 'depressing', 'things', 'when', 'realize', 'apathy', 'illiteracy', 'how', 'little', 'others', 'truly', 'care', 'others', 'CAN', 'build', 'castle', 'sky', 'CAN', 'achieve', 'whatever', 'want', 'CAN', 'make', 'dreams', 'come', 'true', 'be', 'warned', 'are', 'minority', 'Being', 'dreamer', 'doer', 'HARD', 'WORK', 'as', 'well', 'capital', 'as', 'well', 'certain', 'risk', 'taking', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'ready', 'do', 'answer', 'answer', 'answer', 'yes', 'then', 'GO', 'GET', 'IT', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'whatever', 'stop', 'achieving', 'dream']",N/A
258673,A1Q0AQ2HVNSYYW,6301627768,Mr. Cairene,"[7, 10]","In a strange roundabout way Dead Poets Society is like Milos Forman's One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest. Both films pretend to be about much more then they are. That film turned the tale of a convict in mental asylum in to an  anti-establishment metaphor, and similarly this film (unwisely) turns a  school tale into a freedom of expression soap opera. Ofcourse Cukoo's nest  is a better film because the message doesn't reach the sachrrine heights it  does here. Yet beneath the gloss of Dead Poets Society there is a simpler,  more engaging tale of friends at school that makes the film well worth  watching.  Peter Weir is a director whose films any self respecting film  buff should make a point of seeking out. His early (and under appreciated)  masterpieces include The Last Wave, Last Picnic at Hanging Rock, and  Galipoli. He has made modern classics (Witness, The Truman Show) and little  gems( Fearless, Greencard). His best though is the 1983 journalist drama  The Year of Living Dangerously.Dead Poets Society is perhaps his  least work, the freedom of expreesion/self actualisation message is  completely contrived, bears very little resemblance to the behaviour or  concerns of average teenagers, and thus a big distraction in the centre of  the film that almost sinks it. So is the tragic fate of Neil, it feels like  manipulation, a trick and left me unmoved. We now come to the ending which  is downright embarassing. Then why is this film worth seeing (and perhaps  owning)? Because of the actors playing the students, and their more  interesting(and moving) side stories. Ethan Hawke is great as the shy  student who has difficulty communitating, similarly Robert Sean Lenorad  plays the father pleasing affable Neil to perfection.Of these stories I  enjoyed Nox Overstreet's persuit of the popular girl the most engaging,the  scene at a party where huge football players mistake him for somebody else  is hilarious. Perhaps this would have been a great film if it just were  their story, leaving out the Robin Williams character entirely, because on  the level of the students this is a wonderful film.

258677,A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ,6301627768,Nicholas Carroll,"[12, 14]","This film had the brilliant timing of being released in the summer before my Senior year in high school. Though I didn't watch it until it came to the $1 theater in the fall of 1989, by that point, I had already been in a government class with a teacher who was nearly exactly like the one Robin Williams played. For that reason, and many more, this film quickly became one of my all-time favorite films (only ""The Sound of Music"" endears me more).I have a well worn copy of this film on VHS and waited to buy it on DVD because I suspected that Touchstone would re-release another version with more bells and whistles. They did so with ""Beaches"", another film I was glad not to buy the first DVD version. I've been waiting for a special edition DVD that features deleted scenes, interviews, and most important...a director's commentary track. This dvd is well worth the wait and I can finally replace my VHS copy.Though Robin Williams was nominated for Best Actor with this film, he is actually a supporting character to the boys he inspires with his unconventional teaching. His Mr. Keating is a new teacher who soon gets into trouble for breaking out of the box of teaching methods, as he tries to get his students to challenge their thinking and ways of viewing the world. Memorable scenes include the marching in the courtyard as a lesson in nonconformity; standing atop his desk for a new perspective; the ripping out of Mr. Jay Evans Pritchard's rhyme and meter measurement theory; and the moment he is able to draw out a shy student's inner poet (I especially love the line ""truth like a blanket that always leaves your feet cold"").The cinematography and location is absolutely perfect. So enamored of this film in my ""impressionable age"" that I made a pilgrimage to St. Andrews School in Middleton, Delaware and took a roll of photos, with me acting out some of the scenes (like Niwanda's refusal to march in the courtyard; and the phonecall from God at the podium of the chapel). The film really does bring out a magic and I would suspect that St Andrews School benefitted from the film. It really is beautiful there in person (if you go, go in the fall).Though this film was criticized by some Christian groups during the 1990 Academy Awards for its ""humanism"", I guess if inspiring people to think for themselves and having the courage to go against the flow is considered ""humanist"", what does that say about Christianity? I can see Mr. Keating as an atheist, though it really isn't spelled out. His unconventional ways of teaching runs against the standard and rigid structure of tradition, so it's not surprising that he becomes the scapegoat for the resulting tragedy when one student goes against his parents' wishes.Everytime I watch this film, I receive an initial burst of inspiration that feels too good to let go. With the tributes to Henry David Thoreau (""sucking the marrow out of life doesn't mean choking on the bone,"" Mr. Keating tells his students) and Walt Whitman (""a sweaty tooth madman""), you'll want to make sure you have copies of both ""Leaves of Grass"" and ""Walden"" to read when you finish watching.

In fact, the older I get, the more this movie speaks to me with its message about the fleeting nature of our lives, and of our limited opportunities to live them fully.Robin Williams is absolutely brilliant as John Keating, a new teacher at the Welton Academy, an all-boys' preparatory school.  Welton (also called ""Hellton"" by the students) is a place of deep tradition and strong discipline, where scholarship is exalted and frivolity of any kind is discouraged and promptly squelched.  Conformity is the order of the day, and that order is rigidly enforced by the entire Welton staff.By all, that is, except Mr. Keating.  Keating approaches life with an eager heart and an open mind as he pursues his motto, ""Carpe Diem"", seize the day.  As a teacher of English poetry, he makes language and literature come alive, not just as a means of communicating ideas, but as the very stuff of life -- love, passion, adventure and mystery -- dripping from the pens of poets long dead.  He inspires the teenage young men to look beyond cultural pressures and demands for conformity, and to live life with an irrepressible zest while there's still time.  Too many men, Keating reminds his students, live lives of quiet desperation, and he exhorts them not to follow suit.The students resurrect the ""Dead Poets Society"", a secret and unauthorized group of bon vivants who choose to live out the ""carpe diem"" philosophy.  Meeting in a remote Indian cave, the ""Poets"" breathe new life into the poetry they read, and allow it to breathe new life into them, as ""spirits soar, women swoon, and gods are created"" in their sessions.The movie is also one of conflict and immense loss.  Neil, one of the students and a leader of the Poets, realizes his passion, and his gift, for acting.  When he chooses to ""seize the day"" and pursue his calling, he encounters sharp and unrelenting opposition from his stern father, who is a foil for ""the system"" that holds the souls of men in the dreary bondage of conformity.  Neil is taken to the heights of ecstasy and the depths of despair as he is caught in the battle between his heart's desire and his father's demands.  The result is tragic.For those who have never seen this movie, by all means do!  If you already have seen it, watch it again, and remind yourself to make time to be alive.",5,Inspiring and poignant.

Perhaps we are now too far removed from the days when a masculine society cosseted itself in the first of many institutions in this way, although  goodness knows, it really wasn't so long ago. So many of the details of  this movie failed to hold true; it lacked continuity in the most important  areas, at the most important moments. Relationships were explored but never  developed. Tradition and discipline are all very well, but they must be  maintained in order to be effective. At no time did I think the film was  seriously questioning these twin virtues of another age. The character of  Robin Williams was acting entirely within the scope of the school, as he  needs must. And the difference between the meetings in the grotto and the  school drama, which was supposed to play such a pivotal role in the plot,  was scarcely apparent.Only Robin Williams really shone. Somehow his  acting is effortless and I will remember this as another good Robin  Williams movie, though I only give it four stars. Among the actors playing  the schoolboys, some had been carefully chosen for their adolescent  qualities; just look at their faces. Others were typecast and I found  myself unable to reach into the depths of imagination to the extent of  finding them believable. The unfortunate event near the end of the movie  was typical of the rest. It was unplanned and unprovided for and the  charade which followed, in which students were interviewed by both the  headmaster and the boy's parents, only served to confirm the fact. As for  the final scene, well, by then, something dramatic was needed to conclude,  I certainly agree.Yet before the movie lost its track, it had much  promise. How much of that was due to the impact of Robin Williams is hard  to say, but there is a relationship. Schoolboy life before 1960 was often  like that of the temporarily indentured servant, no matter what Williams  claimed to the contrary. There were limits to what could be done and  stepping outside them brought a firm response, there is no doubt. So there  are very few real schools, methinks, in which these events could have  unfolded, although fragments of them no doubt occurred in all schools. This  is what this movie brought to life; a fragmentary glimpse of a world now  closed.

258684,A1ZNGD2TMQY7HQ,6301627768,Pato Cree,"[7, 13]","(THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS)I saw this movie about 3 years ago on TV and really enjoyed it. I thought there was strong emotional depth, impressive acting, and a well-structured storyline. However, the next time I saw it which was about a year ago, I was underwhelmed. Don't get me wrong; it's not a horrible movie. It's just not as engaging as I thought it was. A lot of this does have to do with its tired, overused premise: the rebellious students oppose conservative, authoritative parents with the help of their liberal teacher. Now, you can take any premise and make it into a good movie, but DEAD POETS SOCIETY doesn't bother to give us anything fresh or insightful. It's just ""Find yourself"" and ""Seize the Day!"" and ""Believe and you will succeed"" for 2 hours.I still think the acting is generally fine, especially from the kids. I'm surprised that only Ethan Hawke and Robert Sean Leonard were the only ones that went anywhere after this movie (correct me if I'm wrong). The adults aside from Williams however are not as effective. They're just stereotypical, hard-core conservative snobs who want to only keep the kids from ""expressing who they truly are in life."" Not much depth is given to them. Robin Williams is good too, but not as spectacular as most people claim him to be. When he's onscreen, he's enjoyable and effective. When he's not, I don't miss him. I guess it has to do with the fact that there's not much to his character. He's just a wise, caring, liberal teacher who only wants to help his students. That's not bad, but he seems more like a representation of the movie's idea of Carpe Diem than an actual character. Mr. Keating also acts more like a plot device because he is only around when he's either a) teaching a class, or b) helping a student(s) outside of class. I guess that's why I don't miss him when he's not onscreen. The rest of the movie is about the kids taking his lessons and applying to their daily lives. Nothing wrong with that, but it would have been better if we saw Keating more as just the teacher/moral support. Bland characterization, however, is not the only problem I have with this film.The biggest problem for me is the third act when the Robert Sean Leonard kid commits suicide. What the heck happened?! I would be emotionally involved if the film bothered to show signs of him struggling with suicidal thoughts. But this seems so sudden and out of nowhere. The kid does the play, his father doesn't approve, and he kills himself. That doesn't work. This is the part that makes me wonder why this movie won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay because when I see a movie that has a sporadic act of tragedy, I don't think, ""Oh, my goodness! This is so sad and moving!"" I think, ""What the heck? Did the screenwriter run out of ideas?"" Here's the thing: Suicide can be a powerful dramatic tool if handled correctly. It can work in a story that sets itself up as a tragedy. But this movie sets itself up more as an inspirational and uplifting drama, so this act of despair seems out of place. Even at the end where the kids stand up on their desks and protest, I still had a hard time getting past that kid's suicide. Another thing that bothers me about this is that it's such a cheap way to show how damaging conservative attitudes can be and how helpful liberal attitudes can be. This can be an effective lesson but here it's told clumsily. The screenwriter forces the audience to care instead of simply telling a story and allowing the audience to be naturally affected by it. I'm sure the person who wrote the script meant well, but this comes across as a little condescending. It seems like they're saying, ""Care for these characters right now!"" I'll feel what I'll feel, just show us these people and their lives.That's all I can think of for now. Hopefully, I didn't rant too much.

Well, John Keating is definitely the kind of teacher I always wanted in school and still do.  Every one of Williams's jokes and ad-libs fit perfectly into the story as he guides future Hollywood stars...I mean, students through the riggers of an elite all-boys boarding school.  This should be a case study for how a person should behave if they want to be humorous while still being taken seriously.  It doesn't entirely work in the film, but it definitely works for anyone in the audience like myself.  As for the students, as I ""accidentally"" already noted, it's a who's who of famous actors in their early years, including Ethan Hawke, Robert Sean Leonard, and Josh Charles.  They do fine as well, though none of them can top Williams.  Thankfully, none of them try and instead focus on their own performances, which consequently came out pretty darn good.  While this film is by no means a substitute for an English class, it is a film worth taking time out of your day for.  It shows us that it's okay to be different and to defy authority figures while guiding us as to how one can be different and defy authority figures without it actually becoming inappropriate.

This movie was our English case study in class and our teacher made it compulsory for us to watch it in cinemas and so we did.  I was sixteen years old then, an impressionable age as those teenagers that were portrayed in here.  I couldn't understand much about the depth and subtleties of those poems by Emerson, Frost, Whitman, Thoreau, et cetera but one message did manage to sink in is ""Carpe Diem - Seize the Day"".  For all its worth, I gave everything a go and that value has taken me places.  Many times I failed but that didn't bother me because I know that I would be able to get myself together and tried again.  Neil's character in that movie died but to me, where there's death, there's a rebirth and whilst he faltered, he reminded us all to live our dreams.  That value I also implemented upon my friends and loved ones and I could literally see their transformations.  I revisited this movie again eighteen years later and its message is still as relevant and as powerful as it was eighteen years ago.  With the extra features such as interviews with some of the actors who have now all but grown up, they talked candidly about how that movie changed their lives and the relativity between John Keating, the teacher and Peter Weir, the Director.  They all said unanimously that he had a rather unorthodox way of directing and brought out the best in his crew.  Then, there were the deleted scene of John Keating and the students went to the cave to celebrate after Neil's performance in Midsummer's Night Dream.  Two additional main features were the technical aspect of using lighting to convey different seasons of the year and a homage to the set director.  To me, this is a definite classic.  I wouldn't see it simply as an entertainment piece but a piece of work that might change someone's lives (as it had done to me).  This is as powerful as the movie can get.

It was the most influential film I had ever watched, and the only one that I could relate  to directly and indirectly.Robin Williams plays the English teacher, John Keating, who brings enthusiasm to the classroom of young scholars whose only sense of fun is spending time together in their study groups.  But his method of teaching was rather unconventional.  Keating did not conduct an in your face way of teaching, and nor did he spoon feed the boys in his class.  Keating suggests to the students that in any formal environment, there is the strict expectation that one follows the straight and narrow, and free thinking is the antagonist where there should not exist any curves or turns.  He simply opens the minds of the students who only thought that going to prep school was the easiest way to get to Harvard.  And in essence, the main gist of the film has to do with, no matter what direction in life one takes, poetry is the path to expression.This movie was high with emotions and of course relationships.  I particularly thought Ethan Hawke's performance was very convincing.  If you've ever been a situation like Hawke's character, you would know what I mean; watch the movie and you'll understand.  Also, the relationship between Robert Sean Leonard's character and his father was very realistic of a person who's dying to break free from parental influence.As in any movie depicting honor and respect (School Ties and Scent of a Woman), someone suffers the consequences, but no one is left standing alone.  In the case of Dead Poets Society, the circle of friendship that existed between the students became a hard lesson.  The film makes a good  of emphasizing that those whom you thought were invincible, turned out to be less of your expectations, and the movie was good at presenting that scenario.If you  like a movie that doesn't preach to you, but nourishes your mind with words  to ponder, or words of encouragement, I recommend Dead Poets Society.",5,Inspirational,948412800,"01 21, 2000",2000,2099,"['matter', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'watch', 'particular', 'movie', 'certain', 'ones', 'have', 'way', 'moving', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'Society', 'was', 'one', 'was', 'most', 'influential', 'film', 'had', 'ever', 'watched', 'only', 'one', 'could', 'relate', 'directly', 'indirectly.Robin', 'Williams', 'English', 'teacher', 'John', 'Keating', 'who', 'enthusiasm', 'classroom', 'young', 'scholars', 'only', 'sense', 'fun', 'spending', 'time', 'together', 'study', 'groups', 'method', 'teaching', 'was', 'rather', 'unconventional', 'Keating', 'did', 'not', 'conduct', 'face', 'way', 'teaching', 'did', 'spoon', 'feed', 'boys', 'class', 'Keating', 'students', 'formal', 'environment', 'strict', 'expectation', 'one', 'straight', 'narrow', 'free', 'thinking', 'antagonist', 'where', 'there', 'should', 'not', 'exist', 'curves', 'turns', 'simply', 'minds', 'students', 'who', 'only', 'thought', 'going', 'prep', 'school', 'was', 'easiest', 'way', 'get', 'Harvard', 'essence', 'main', 'gist', 'film', 'do', 'matter', 'what', 'direction', 'life', 'one', 'poetry', 'path', 'expression.This', 'movie', 'was', 'high', 'emotions', 'course', 'relationships', 'particularly', 'thought', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'performance', 'was', 'very', 'convincing', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'been', 'situation', 'Hawke', 'character', 'would', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'watch', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'Also', 'relationship', 'Robert', 'Sean', 'Leonard', 'character', 'father', 'was', 'very', 'realistic', 'person', 'who', 'dying', 'break', 'free', 'parental', 'influence.As', 'movie', 'depicting', 'honor', 'respect', 'School', 'Ties', 'Scent', 'Woman', 'someone', 'consequences', 'one', 'left', 'standing', 'alone', 'case', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'Society', 'circle', 'friendship', 'existed', 'students', 'became', 'hard', 'lesson', 'film', 'good', 'emphasizing', 'whom', 'thought', 'were', 'invincible', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'less', 'expectations', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'presenting', 'scenario.If', 'movie', ""n't"", 'preach', 'nourishes', 'mind', 'words', 'ponder', 'words', 'encouragement', 'recommend', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'Society']",N/A

Sounds mundane, but it isn't. The real strength in this film is that it doesn't leave 'heroic tales' to the 'heroic past', it brings heroic ideals and potential to the life of everyday students in modern society. Every student is special, every student is capable of special things, and perhaps most of all, every student is capable of happiness and true freedom. We ourselves are heroes, we ourselves can make the future beautiful.What is poetry? Is it a quaint little way of expressing words and ideas suited to the old or the quiet types? No, it is life, it is the expression of the soul, the heart and expression of the struggle for independance, freedom and happiness. &quot;So it is about a bunch of guys standing around reading poetry&quot;, asks one of the students? No, they didn't 'read it', they were themselves the embodiment of it, they were life itself finding itself young and beautiful. The 'dead poets' refers, I believe, to the death of mediocrity, the birth of substance and freedom of the free. The motto is simple, sieze the day, sieze the time, live life in beauty and grandeur, die to mediocrity, and express all of who you are. Wise words. The trouble is, some will not like you for it, in rare cases you may die for it.This film captures many of the passions and the troubles young people of all ages experience, but importantly, it also manages to put these passions and troubles in the social sphere of modern young humanity.

It's nearly enough to make anyone lose faith in Peter Weir's abilities as a director (thank God he redeemed himself with the brilliant TRUMAN SHOW).  Robin Williams appears in yet another one of  his serious, fine-specimen-of-a-man roles, this time playing an offbeat  English teacher at a boys' prep school.  It's not his worst performance,  since for the most part he eschews the obvious humor, but you know you're  watching a bad movie when Robin Williams turns out to be the best thing in  it--and DEAD POETS SOCIETY is a shamefully bad movie.The film  unabashedly lifts quotes from Thoreau and other notable writers, many of  whom would have rolled over in their graves to see their thoughtful,  reflective writings reduced to trite, easy-to-swallow tidbits--the  equivalent of literary mashed potatoes.  DEAD POETS SOCIETY seems to be in  a rush to pay homage to the joy of literature, so it's ironic that the  story embodies literature's worst elements--predictable soap opera  plotting, godawful dialogue, and cheap, obvious payoffs.  A character  shoots himself at the end, and I couldn't have cared less--my only regret  is that the rest of the young lads didn't subsequently gut themselves  (that, at least, would have made this thing interesting).

We see how the other teachers teach -- threats, boredom, etc.  And we see how Robin Williams' character teaches -- with interest, with involvement and with getting the boys to see that poetry and the arts are what we live for.  ""Carpe Diem"" is the watchword in his class!These new teaching methods have an impact on the boys -- one decides to get the girl of his dreams and takes each small step as a gain.  Another decides to break through his shyness and fear of expression.But the film is really about another boy, Neal (played dramatically well by Robert Sean Leonard) who is literally in a fight for his future life -- with a draconian father who makes him guilty with every small decision squashed if it does nto conform to the father's goals.  Neal's story ends tragically and even more so points out the folly of restraint and of harsh demands on young minds and hearts.The boys' defiance with authority and a somewhat beginnigns of what we would call the ""beat"" generation was dramatic and fun to watch.  The cinematography was great as well -- the birds squawking and honking and then cut to the boys' squawking and yawping -- was excellent.Will you scoff at this film's message as hackneyed and go back to your 9 to 5 slavery, or will you take another look at your life and be willing to change it?  The answer that comes back to you will determine if this film becomes a favorite or not.DVD:Perfect extras for a film school:  how the lighting of the sets was done, the amazing sound technicians, a trailer and interviews with the actors -- who expressed how Peter Weir was an inspiration to them (in the same way as Williams' character was an inspiration).Highly recommended.Other Films:This film reminded me of Goodbye Mr. Chips, though not as dark.Goodbye, Mr. ChipsAnother is the Brendan Frasier film, School Ties.School TiesAnd, Richard Dreyfus' film: Mr. Holland's Opus.Mr. Holland's OpusCast & Crew:*  Actors: Robin Williams, Robert Sean Leonard, Ethan Hawke, Josh Charles, Gale Hansen*  Directors: Peter Weir*  Writers: Tom Schulman",5,O Captain My Captain -- Excellent Film!,1304208000,"05 1, 2011",2011,2227,"['short', 'review', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'Peter', 'Weir', 'film', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'Society', 'private', 'boys', 'school', 'late', '1950s', 'teacher', 'who', 'unorthodox', 'teaching', 'methods', 'see', 'how', 'other', 'teachers', 'teach', 'threats', 'boredom', 'etc', 'see', 'how', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'character', 'teaches', 'interest', 'involvement', 'getting', 'boys', 'see', 'poetry', 'arts', 'are', 'what', 'live', 'Carpe', 'Diem', 'watchword', 'class', 'new', 'teaching', 'methods', 'have', 'impact', 'boys', 'one', 'get', 'girl', 'dreams', 'small', 'step', 'gain', 'break', 'shyness', 'fear', 'expression.But', 'film', 'really', 'boy', 'Neal', 'played', 'dramatically', 'well', 'Robert', 'Sean', 'Leonard', 'who', 'literally', 'fight', 'future', 'life', 'draconian', 'father', 'who', 'guilty', 'small', 'decision', 'squashed', 'nto', 'conform', 'father', 'goals', 'Neal', 'story', 'tragically', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'out', 'folly', 'restraint', 'harsh', 'demands', 'young', 'minds', 'hearts.The', 'boys', 'defiance', 'authority', 'somewhat', 'beginnigns', 'what', 'would', 'call', 'beat', 'generation', 'was', 'dramatic', 'fun', 'watch', 'cinematography', 'was', 'great', 'as', 'well', 'birds', 'squawking', 'honking', 'then', 'cut', 'boys', 'squawking', 'yawping', 'was', 'excellent.Will', 'scoff', 'film', 'message', 'hackneyed', 'go', 'back', '9', '5', 'slavery', 'will', 'take', 'look', 'life', 'be', 'willing', 'change', 'answer', 'back', 'will', 'determine', 'film', 'favorite', 'not.DVD', 'Perfect', 'extras', 'film', 'school', 'how', 'lighting', 'sets', 'was', 'done', 'amazing', 'sound', 'technicians', 'trailer', 'interviews', 'actors', 'who', 'expressed', 'how', 'Peter', 'Weir', 'was', 'inspiration', 'same', 'way', 'Williams', 'character', 'was', 'inspiration', '.Highly', 'recommended.Other', 'Films', 'film', 'reminded', 'Goodbye', 'Mr.', 'Chips', 'though', 'not', 'dark.Goodbye', 'Mr.', 'ChipsAnother', 'Brendan', 'Frasier', 'film', 'School', 'Ties.School', 'TiesAnd', 'Richard', 'Dreyfus', 'film', 'Mr.', 'Holland', 'Opus.Mr', 'Holland', 'OpusCast', 'Crew', '*', 'Actors', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Robert', 'Sean', 'Leonard', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'Josh', 'Charles', 'Gale', 'Hansen*', 'Directors', 'Peter', 'Weir*', 'Writers', 'Tom', 'Schulman']",N/A

Because the longer you wait, the less likely you are to find it at all.""(6) ""You must trust that your beliefs are unique, your own, even though others may think them odd or unpopular, even though the herd [of conformists] may go 'that's bad.'""(7) The quotation that titles this review also comes from Keating.(Literally, the Latin phrase of (2) above is technically ""diem carpere"" which translated means ""to make the most of the present."")Keating's charisma and love of poetry (from such people as Thoreau, Whitman, Shakespeare, Tennyson, and Frost) inspires several school students such as Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard) and Knox Overstreet (Josh Charles) to revive a secret society (called the ""Dead Poets Society"") but this time, with a Bohemian twist.  As well, some of the students take what these dead poets and Keating say too literally.  This ultimately leads, in one case, to tragedy.However, the movie ends on an uplifting note about intellectual freedom and creativity.The acting is terrific.  Williams is not on-screen all the time but when he is, he gives a good, restrained, dramatic performance and the script gives him wide latitude for him to do his own brand of comedy (and he delivers). The story is mainly about Keating's influence (through the dead poets' works) on his students.  Actors Leonard and Charles give good performances as very influenced students.The background music adds to each scene.  There is even some classical music.  The cinematography is also quite well done.  The filming was at St. Andrews, a private boarding school in Delaware.Note that this movie had four Academy Award nominations: Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Director (Peter Weir), and Best Original Screenplay.Also note that this movie (""Special Edition"") is NOT the director's cut.  This movie lasts about a minute longer than the original theatrical release version.Finally, the DVD itself (Special Edition) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has several extras.  In one of these extras are interviews with some of the cast.  There is, however, no interview with Robin Williams.  I found this strange since he is given top billing in this movie and he received a Best Actor nomination.In conclusion, I recommend viewing this movie in order to understand the full meaning of the phrase ""carpe diem.""(1989;  2 hr, 9 min)+++++",5,"""No matter what anybody tells you, words and ideas can change the world""",1139616000,"02 11, 2006",2006,2950,"['+++++This', 'movie', 'based', 'book', 'same', 'title', 'N.H.', 'Kleinbaum.In', 'movie', 'set', 'late', '1950s', 'meet', 'unconventional', 'English', 'teacher', 'named', 'John', 'Keating', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'who', 'students', 'conservative', 'expensive', 'all-male', 'prep', 'school', 'such', 'things', 'following', '1', 'purpose', 'education', '[', ']', 'learn', 'think', '2', 'Carpe', 'diem', 'seize', 'day', 'make', 'lives', 'extraordinary', '3', 'read', 'write', 'poetry', 'are', 'members', 'human', 'race', '4', 'Only', 'dreams', 'can', 'men', '[', 'women', ']', 'be', 'truly', 'free', '5', 'must', 'strive', 'find', 'own', 'voice', 'longer', 'wait', 'less', 'likely', 'are', 'find', '6', 'must', 'trust', 'beliefs', 'are', 'unique', 'own', 'even', 'others', 'may', 'think', 'unpopular', 'even', 'herd', '[', 'conformists', ']', 'may', 'go', ""'that"", 'bad', '7', 'quotation', 'review', 'also', 'Keating', 'Literally', 'Latin', 'phrase', '2', 'above', 'technically', 'diem', 'carpere', 'translated', 'make', 'most', 'present', 'Keating', 'charisma', 'love', 'poetry', 'such', 'people', 'Thoreau', 'Whitman', 'Shakespeare', 'Tennyson', 'Frost', 'several', 'school', 'students', 'such', 'Neil', 'Perry', 'Robert', 'Sean', 'Leonard', 'Knox', 'Overstreet', 'Josh', 'Charles', 'revive', 'secret', 'society', 'called', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'Society', 'time', 'Bohemian', 'twist', 'well', 'students', 'take', 'what', 'dead', 'poets', 'Keating', 'say', 'too', 'literally', 'ultimately', 'one', 'case', 'tragedy.However', 'movie', 'uplifting', 'note', 'intellectual', 'freedom', 'creativity.The', 'acting', 'terrific', 'Williams', 'not', 'on-screen', 'time', 'when', 'good', 'restrained', 'dramatic', 'performance', 'script', 'wide', 'latitude', 'do', 'own', 'brand', 'comedy', 'story', 'mainly', 'Keating', 'influence', 'dead', 'poets', 'works', 'students', 'Actors', 'Leonard', 'Charles', 'give', 'good', 'performances', 'very', 'influenced', 'students.The', 'background', 'music', 'scene', 'even', 'classical', 'music', 'cinematography', 'also', 'quite', 'well', 'done', 'filming', 'was', 'St.', 'Andrews', 'private', 'boarding', 'school', 'Delaware.Note', 'movie', 'had', 'four', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominations', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Best', 'Director', 'Peter', 'Weir', 'Best', 'Original', 'Screenplay.Also', 'note', 'movie', 'Special', 'Edition', 'NOT', 'director', 'cut', 'movie', 'minute', 'longer', 'original', 'theatrical', 'release', 'version.Finally', 'DVD', 'Special', 'Edition', 'perfect', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'several', 'extras', 'one', 'extras', 'are', 'interviews', 'cast', 'however', 'interview', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'found', 'strange', 'given', 'top', 'billing', 'movie', 'received', 'Best', 'Actor', 'nomination.In', 'conclusion', 'recommend', 'viewing', 'movie', 'order', 'understand', 'full', 'meaning', 'phrase', 'carpe', 'diem', '1989', '2', 'hr', '9', 'min', '+++++']",N/A

One of the characters dies and another loses his job. I have never been to a school like the one portrayed in the film. Something keeps me coming back and I recently upgraded when it was released on Blu-ray for the first time.Robin Williams as John Keating holds the whole thing together with his unconventional style of teaching. The film proves that Williams is a genuine acting talent and not just a gifted comedian. Many of the scenes are moving and some of the prominent themes include friendship, parenting, romance and individuality. Peter Weir gets some good performances out of the (mainly) young cast and the situations in which they find themselves feel authentic for the most part.My favorite scenes include the moment when Todd Anderson (Hawke) finally overcomes his excessive shyness and also Neil Perry's (Leonard) realization that he was born to act. If you strip down the subject material there's not a whole lot there, but the atmosphere of the movie draws me in and makes me feel as though I am a part of that group of boys.

Robin Williams delivered his best performance in this film and the supporting cast is no less brilliant.  This film made a star out of Ethan Hawke and a very young Robert Sean Leonard of ""House"" fame is no less convincing in his role.  The story is very simple actually and the Amazon review does tell enough about the story so that I don't have to repeat it here.  I just want people to remember this classic film that only cost about 15 million to make and ended up grossing 235+ million.  It's a testimony that a great film doesn't have to cost a fortune to make.I love any films that are education centered and this is one of my favorites and it will be yours to.

(Henry David Thoreau, ""Walden."")Hands up folks, how many of us discovered Thoreau after having watched this movie? *Really* discovered I mean, regardless whether you had known he'd existed before. How many believe they know what Thoreau was talking about in that passage about ""sucking the marrow out of life"" cited in the movie, even if you didn't spend the next 2+ years of your life living in a self-constructed cabin on a pond in the woods? How many bought a copy of Whitman's poems ... whatever collection? (And maybe even read more than ""Oh Captain! My Captain!""?) How many went on to read Emerson? Frost? Or John Keats, on whose personality Robin Williams's John Keating is probably losely based? Judging by the vast majority of the reviews on this site alone, you just can't fail to notice that this movie has a powerful appeal like few others; ""inspirational"" is probably the most frequently used word in the opinions represented here. And justifiedly so, despite the fact that charismatic Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard), one of the movie's main characters, tragically falters in the pursuit of his dreams, in the wake of apparent triumph. Because although Neil's story is one of failure, ultimately this movie is a celebration of the triumph of free will, independent thinking and the growth of personality; embodied in its closing scene.Of course, lofty goals such as these are not easily achieved. Todd Anderson (Ethan Hawke) in particular, the last scene's triumphant hero, is literally pushed to the edge of reason before he learns to overcome his inhibitions. And Thoreau said in ""Walden:"" ""If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost; That is where they should be. Now put the foundations under them."" Anyone who takes this movie's message to heart (and Thoreau's, and Whitman's, and Emerson's, Frost's and Keats's) knows that success too easily won is often no success at all, and most of our truly important accomplishments are based on focus, tenacity and hard work as much as on anything else. And prudence, too ... dashing Charlie Dalton (Gale Hansen) pays a high price for his spur-of-the-moment challenges of authority; although of course you just gotta love him for refusing to sign Keating's indictment. ""Carpe diem"" - live life to its fullest, but always know what you are doing, too.You won't enjoy this movie if you are afraid of letting your mind and your feelings run free. Shot on the magnificent location of Delaware's St. Andrews Academy, ""Dead Poets' Society"" is visually stunning, particularly in its depiction of the amazingly beautiful scenery (where the progression of the seasons mirrors the progression of the movie's story line), and it is as emotionally engaging as it invites you to mentally reexamine your position in life. Robin Williams delivers another Academy Award-worthy performance (he was nominated but unfortunately didn't win). Of course, Robin Williams will to a certain extent always be Robin Williams ... ""Aladdin's"" Genie, ""Good Morning Vietnam's"" Adrian Cronauer and ""Good Will Hunting's"" Professor McGuire (the 1997 role which would finally earn him his long overdue Oscar) all shimmer through in his portrayal of John Keating; and if you've ever seen him give an interview you know that the man can go from hilarious and irreverent to deeply reflective in a split second even when it's not a movie camera that's rolling. Yet, the black sheep among Welton Academy's teachers assumes as distinct and memorable a personality as any other one of Williams's film characters.Of its many Academy Award nominations (in addition to Robin Williams's nomination for best leading actor, the movie was also nominated in the best picture, best director [Peter Weir] and best original screenplay categories), ""Dead Poets' Society"" ultimately only won the Oscar for Tom Schulman's script. But more importantly, it has long since won it's viewers' lasting appreciation, and for a reason. - As the Poet said: ""Camerado!

258713,A2I5O8AEFU1SOK,6301627768,the_smoking_quill,"[0, 0]","This beautiful, poignant film stars Robin Williams as a new, iconclastic English teacher (John Keating) at a prestigious, conservative boarding school.  Keating fans the flames of poetry and passion in several of his students, who revive a tradition Keating founded during his time as a student at the school: The Dead Poets Society.  By day, the young men attend Keating's unorthodox classes, where he encourages them to think and dream for themselves and to understand that, while law and medicine and business sustain life, poetry and passion make life worth sustaining.  By night, they gather in a woodland cave, sharing poetry, stories, music and friendship.  Their lives grow and change . . . and ultimately collide with the strictures of the school and the destinies ordained by their parents--with tragic and touching results.Williams, Robert Sean Leonard as the inspired Neil and a young Ethan Hawke as the socially stunted Todd give wonderful, heartfelt performances; and the cinematography--depicting glorious autumn days with flocks of Canadian geese and golden light, shadows and the school's Gothic architecture--is magnificent.  In particular, the scene depicting Keating's first class--wherein the students stand silently before ancient, graying photographs of their predecessors, once immortal, now dead, while Keating whispers as from beyond the grave, &quot;Carpe diem . . . seize the day, boys . . . make your lives extraordinary&quot;--is alone worth the viewing.  Inspirational through and through, this is a film about dreams, which also shows wisdom in addressing the consequences of pursuing dreams recklessly (&quot;Nuwanda&quot;) and not defending them when the time comes (Neil).  Highly recommended.Afternote: As a high school senior visiting my future college, I attended an English class, where, for a sparkling moment, the man on whom Keating was based (Pickering, I believe) appeared in the classroom doorway to greet the professor.

All these sports star's group pictures, their tropheys, the glitter and the gold of the days of old, all gone. All turned to dust. Seize the moment! Williams tells these young men. For one day you to will be a photo, a trophey, a speck of glitter and gold from the days of old. Breathe! Inhale! Exhale! Spread your wings. This is your moment. Seize it! This is how the story goes. Sure, it's a little sappy at times. It has a definate liberal bent. But it's about the spirit of Whitman, Emerson and Thoreau. The younger generations ask, who are they? What have they to do with me? everything! They are the reason for this story. They are the inspiration of so many of us who were still taught about this American Holy Trilogy. Life can be a real ____sandwhich. But with heroes like those in the &quot;Dead Poet's Society&quot; you learn things that endure and expand beyond the dead wood of life. You hear the trees talking to you as the wind rushes through.

258715,ALN0TTRTLHA4E,6301627768,"Tom Munro ""tomfrombrunswick""","[18, 79]","Was seen as some sort of highbrow film when it was released, hard to see why. The main charcter is a teacher who has a vision of eduction which is at variance with his employers of school being a factory for producing middle class professionals.Our hero believes that education rather than moving you up the social ladder and providing you with money so that you can buy all aspects of life should in some way develop you as a person. The school in which he works no doubt markets itself by the number of young things it can get into elite universities.Our hero starts out by getting his poetry students to tear out a rather leaden prefix to their poetry books so that they can experiance the verse without the inhibiting vision of some long dead book editor. He then suggests that his students should form a society which breaks curfew at the boarding school and read English 19th Century poetry to each other in a cave late at night. All very homo erotic really.During the film one of the boys wants to act rather than to make huge amounts of money being a banker or a dentist. Our hero supports the kid in this rather heroic decision to opt for a career in which there is a 95% unemployment rate and there is nothing to suggest that the kid has any talent. The kids parents go ballistic and the kid kills himself. Now is this really the sort of teacher that you want teaching your kid? Of course in the film the end is heroic. Our teacher has been sacked and he turns up all meek and mild. His kids jump on their desks in a strange form of existential support for him and he shuffles of to a life of unemployment and writing small poems.The reality is that the film is meant to suggest that education is something more than a mechanical imbibing of facts and that in some way should develop independant thought and a basis of seeing the world. Perhaps so but the main character in this film is weird. He wants the kids to call him ""my captain"" and to follow his specific vision of life, a sort of Jungian do what you feel thing, rather than acquire any defined skills. It probably appeals in a sort of nostalgic way to people who have attended dreadful schools but seriously, if this sort of teaching went on we would be back in the 19th Century.",1,...,1012608000,"02 2, 2002",2002,2249,"['Was', 'seen', 'sort', 'highbrow', 'film', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'hard', 'see', 'why', 'main', 'charcter', 'teacher', 'who', 'vision', 'eduction', 'variance', 'employers', 'school', 'being', 'factory', 'producing', 'middle', 'class', 'professionals.Our', 'hero', 'education', 'rather', 'moving', 'social', 'ladder', 'providing', 'money', 'can', 'buy', 'aspects', 'life', 'should', 'way', 'develop', 'person', 'school', 'doubt', 'markets', 'number', 'young', 'things', 'can', 'get', 'elite', 'universities.Our', 'hero', 'out', 'getting', 'poetry', 'students', 'tear', 'out', 'rather', 'leaden', 'prefix', 'poetry', 'books', 'can', 'experiance', 'verse', 'inhibiting', 'vision', 'long', 'dead', 'book', 'editor', 'then', 'students', 'should', 'form', 'society', 'curfew', 'boarding', 'school', 'read', 'English', '19th', 'Century', 'poetry', 'other', 'cave', 'late', 'night', 'very', 'homo', 'erotic', 'really.During', 'film', 'one', 'boys', 'act', 'rather', 'make', 'huge', 'amounts', 'money', 'being', 'banker', 'dentist', 'hero', 'kid', 'rather', 'heroic', 'decision', 'opt', 'career', '95', '%', 'unemployment', 'rate', 'nothing', 'suggest', 'kid', 'talent', 'kids', 'parents', 'go', 'ballistic', 'kid', 'Now', 'really', 'sort', 'teacher', 'want', 'teaching', 'kid', 'course', 'film', 'end', 'heroic', 'teacher', 'been', 'sacked', 'up', 'meek', 'mild', 'kids', 'jump', 'desks', 'strange', 'form', 'existential', 'support', 'life', 'unemployment', 'writing', 'small', 'poems.The', 'reality', 'film', 'meant', 'suggest', 'education', 'something', 'more', 'mechanical', 'imbibing', 'facts', 'way', 'should', 'develop', 'independant', 'thought', 'basis', 'seeing', 'world', 'Perhaps', 'so', 'main', 'character', 'film', 'weird', 'kids', 'call', 'captain', 'follow', 'specific', 'vision', 'life', 'sort', 'Jungian', 'do', 'what', 'feel', 'thing', 'rather', 'acquire', 'defined', 'skills', 'probably', 'appeals', 'sort', 'nostalgic', 'way', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'attended', 'dreadful', 'schools', 'seriously', 'sort', 'teaching', 'went', 'would', 'be', 'back', '19th', 'Century']",N/A

This movie quickly became one of my favorite films of all time! Directed by Peter Weir and written by Tom Schulman, two men who accept the Blakean view that no bird soars too high if he soars with his own two wings. In a rousing performance, Robin Williams stars as John Keating who in the fall of 1959 arrives at Welton Academy, a private boy's prep school, to teach English. Exemplifying his philosophy of strident individualism, this charismatic and unconventional teacher tells his students to seize the day and make their lives extraordinary. Keating's passion for poetry inspires some of his students to revive a secret club that he led when he was a student at the Academy. They gather in a cave to read poetry aloud and share their creative efforts. Among those who are most deeply influenced by Keating are Robert Sean Leonard as a boy who defies his father's orders and plays Puck in A Midsummer Night's Dream, Ethan Hawke as a reclusive lad who learns to stand up for what he believes in, and Josh Charles as a love-sick student who uses poetry to woo a seemingly unattainable girl away from her football star boyfriend. Keating's ardent belief that words and ideas can change the world turns out to be true when a tragedy rocks the Academy and the conservative play-it-by-the-book administration make him into the scapegoat. His best students now become rebels with a cause. Dead Poets Society celebrates nonconformity and freethinking as an adventure worthy of emulation and as some of us know, that subject isn't one of your usual movie theme these days.

This IS how it feels to suddenly discover poetry, beauty, ideas &amp; ideals in a new way, and to believe for the first time that such things are not only worthwhile but necessary. No doubt some older viewers will cringe &amp; squirm a bit, remembering that feeling with some embarrassment; when the moment is no longer so intimate, so open, so vulnerable to us as it once was, seeing it so vividly once more is like seeing pictures of ourselves at that age.

However raw &amp; unformed &amp; obvious that feeling seems to the sensibilities of age &amp; experience, it should be embraced &amp; developed as we grow older.

258722,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,6301627768,Wuchak,"[0, 0]","Released in 1989, Peter Weir's ""Dead Poets Society"" is one of the most inspiring films ever made. It ranks with my all-time favorite movies.THE STORY: John Keating (Robin Williams), a new teacher at a stuffy prep school in 1959, inspires his students to capitalize on their natural talents and develop a passion for life because they only have one shot and in 60 years or so they'll all be worm-food. Each boy starts to act on Keating's dynamic ideas with explosive consequences -- both good and bad.THE CINEMATOGRAPHY AND LOCATIONS are top rate, shot in the Middletown region of Delaware (although the story itself takes place in Vermont). The quiet Fall & Winter scenes are breathtaking.WHAT WORKS: For the most part, the film never takes a wrong turn. It captivates from the very beginning and doesn't release until it's over. That's when you KNOW a movie's really good, regardless of the subject matter.This is not a spoiler, but there's a powerful scene at the climax where the students give Keating a daring final salute. Although Roger Ebert criticized this scene as ""so moving he wanted to throw up,"" he's dead wrong. The scene is both unexpected and potent. That such a great writer & critic as Ebert would criticize this scene (and the movie itself) tells me he watches WAY too many movies. He gave that Roadrunner cartoon ""King Kong '05"" a perfect rating though (rolling my eyes).The film contains a wealth of riches to mine in subsequent viewings, and I don't just mean the insights conjured from the poetry & prose. Here are a handful off the top of my head: ""the letter kills"" (referring to the legalistic nature of Neil's joyless father and most of the teachers at the school); the type of Judas (Cameron); the scapegoat (Keating); the stunning nature of feminine beauty (when Chris appears at the entrance of the school and the guys' mouths drop); the marvels of nature and how they're conducive to inspiration and spirituality; Keating's heartbroken countenance after Neil is removed from the theater crowd by his angry father (Keating knows there's little he can do about the authoritarian abuse); and so much more.WHAT DOESN'T WORK: There are a couple of insignificant scenes that don't work so well but that's always the case, even with the best of films.POSSIBLE OBJECTIONS:First, there's the objection that one boy's tragedy goes against the very message of the film to ""seize the day."" I disagree. The kid really started to ""seize the day"" but his passions were quenched by someone who didn't share Keating's mindset and he unfortunately couldn't handle it. Again, dynamic ideas have explosive consequences, both good and bad. The other kids had varying results with their attempts to ""seize the day."" Some made progress in attaining their dreams and others got in trouble because they threw wisdom to the wind. These VARYING results make the story realistic.Another criticism was voiced by a reviewer who stated that the late night meetings at the cave to read poetry and inspire one another were ""homo erotic."" This interpretation could only be derived by an ADULT in our gay-obsessed modern culture. The kids in the film are about 16-17 years-old. This was the only way they could go out and have fun under the strict rules at a prep school in 1959. I remember when I was a teenager going out to the treehouse with a group of guys and drinking & smoking; we'd sometimes discuss metal/rock lyrics, which could be viewed as a delinquent form of poetry, and other such things. I assure you that not one of us had a gay thought. In the film, in two the cave meetings one of the guys brings a couple babes from another school while the others look on in awe; on a couple of other occasions a couple of the guys bring porn pages of WOMEN. I think that pretty much quells the ""homo-erotic"" theory.Most of those who scoff at this film's message go back to their 9 to 5 slavery (or 3 to 11 or 11 to 7, etc.) with no light at the end of the mundane tunnel. I encourage such people to give the film a second look -- but BEWARE, there are no moronic explosions, CGI, non-stop 'action', gore, OTT cussing, nudity or sex scenes; I know that's completely shocking, but it's true. Then I would encourage these people to take a good look at their lives and ask: Are you willing to change it? Throw off the shackles? Throw caution to the wind and pursue your true calling, your dream? Will you ""sieze the day""? Or will you continue to stagnate in a puddle of mediocrity? The answer that comes back will usually determine if this film becomes a favorite or not.FINAL ANALYSIS: Australian director Peter Weir has other good films like ""Witness"" and ""Picnic at Hanging Rock (The Criterion Collection)"" (the latter is, incidentally, a film about an ALL-GIRLS school and can be boring if you're not in the mood for an ultra-mystery yarn), but ""Dead Poets Society"" is his best. Check it out. Give it a second (or third) chance if you already have. It's an outstanding story and it'll inspire you, especially if you've fallen into a life-stifling, growth-stultifying rut of drudgery.The film runs just over two hours (128 minutes).GRADE: A+",5,Sieze

A few days ago, I watched this video again and was absolutely convinced it is one of the best US movies I have ever watched. Totally no affectation, no fanciness.

I never did appreciate Williams much as a comic actor, but in his straight roles I have found him to be an exceptional actor, and Dead Poets is certainly among his finest. Ethan Hawke and Robert Sean Leonard are also outstanding as two of the vulnerable young students he inspires.Weir films in his usual, mesmerizing way that seems to bring out the beauty in everything. The Delaware locations are the ideal backdrop for his characteristic juxtapositioning of human constraints and the childlike innocence of nature.This is a film that really does challenge us to live, and move us to seize the moment. I can overlook the occasional brief lapse into sentimentality that seeps through into an otherwise convincing, inspiring and utterly unforgettable celebration of life.",5,Weir --- a wonderful talent,1074988800,"01 25, 2004",2004,1063,"['Peter', 'Weir', 'how', 'make', 'truly', 'beautiful', 'film', 'film', 'appeal', 'almost', 'as', 'simple', 'that.Dead', 'Poets', 'Society', 'story', 'John', 'Keating', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'English', 'teacher', 'private', 'school', '1950s', 'New', 'England', 'who', 'students', 'seize', 'day', 'carpe', 'diem', 'never', 'did', 'appreciate', 'Williams', 'much', 'comic', 'actor', 'straight', 'roles', 'have', 'found', 'be', 'exceptional', 'actor', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'certainly', 'finest', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'Robert', 'Sean', 'Leonard', 'are', 'also', 'outstanding', 'two', 'vulnerable', 'young', 'students', 'films', 'usual', 'mesmerizing', 'way', 'bring', 'out', 'beauty', 'everything', 'Delaware', 'locations', 'are', 'ideal', 'backdrop', 'characteristic', 'juxtapositioning', 'human', 'constraints', 'childlike', 'innocence', 'nature.This', 'film', 'really', 'challenge', 'live', 'move', 'seize', 'moment', 'can', 'overlook', 'occasional', 'brief', 'lapse', 'sentimentality', 'otherwise', 'convincing', 'inspiring', 'utterly', 'unforgettable', 'celebration', 'life']",N/A
258725,AP3B615GM191G,6301627768,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[1, 1]","Sometimes a film can become cliched due to sheer overexposure.  Since Dead Poets Society came out in 1989, it has been used in nearly every English classroom in the United States at least once, I believe.  As a result, it suffers from severe overexposure to the general public.  However, as a viewer watching the film for the first time, I was not privy to the cliches, and thus enjoyed it very much.For a basic plot summary, the film focuses on a prestigous East Coast preperatory school.  The students at said school have their entire future planned out, and are under intense pressure to succeed.  Introduced to this atmosphere is new professor John Keating (Robin Williams), whose teachign philosophy in equal parts rankles the traditional faculty, inspires his students, and forever changes the landscape of the institution.This movie is groundbreaking in its portrayal of the teacher-student relationship.  However, the true genius of the filmmaking is that the issues are presetned in shades of grey, not black and white.  Many situation are incredibly complex and have no concrete ""correct answers"", but this film valiantly tackles them anyway.  It doens't shy away from reality, and for that I am thankful, as too many films these days over-simplify real-life situations, leading to watered-down scenarios.In terms of casting, Dead Poets Society is a cut above the rest.  Williams is tremendous as the inspirational instructor, who isn't too over-the-top, but also injects the requiste amount of passion into the role.  Both the professors and students at the prep school are alos spot-on in their characterizations.Thus, I highly recommend this film to anyone who hasn't yet had the pleasure.  It may be highly cliched these days, but that is only because it has been around for so long.  It truly is an amazing film that hsould only get better with time.",5,Only Cliched Now Because It Is Such A Classic,1279929600,"07 24, 2010",2010,1865,"['Sometimes', 'film', 'can', 'become', 'cliched', 'due', 'sheer', 'overexposure', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'Society', 'came', 'out', '1989', 'been', 'used', 'nearly', 'English', 'classroom', 'United', 'States', 'least', 'once', 'believe', 'result', 'severe', 'overexposure', 'general', 'public', 'However', 'viewer', 'watching', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'not', 'privy', 'cliches', 'thus', 'enjoyed', 'very', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'film', 'prestigous', 'East', 'Coast', 'preperatory', 'school', 'students', 'said', 'school', 'have', 'entire', 'future', 'planned', 'out', 'are', 'intense', 'pressure', 'succeed', 'Introduced', 'atmosphere', 'new', 'professor', 'John', 'Keating', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'teachign', 'philosophy', 'equal', 'parts', 'traditional', 'faculty', 'students', 'forever', 'landscape', 'institution.This', 'movie', 'groundbreaking', 'portrayal', 'teacher-student', 'relationship', 'However', 'true', 'genius', 'filmmaking', 'issues', 'are', 'presetned', 'shades', 'grey', 'not', 'black', 'white', 'Many', 'situation', 'are', 'incredibly', 'complex', 'have', 'concrete', 'correct', 'answers', 'film', 'valiantly', 'anyway', 'shy', 'away', 'reality', 'am', 'thankful', 'too', 'many', 'films', 'days', 'over-simplify', 'real-life', 'situations', 'leading', 'watered-down', 'scenarios.In', 'terms', 'casting', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'Society', 'cut', 'rest', 'Williams', 'tremendous', 'inspirational', 'instructor', 'who', ""n't"", 'too', 'over-the-top', 'also', 'requiste', 'amount', 'passion', 'role', 'professors', 'students', 'prep', 'school', 'are', 'alos', 'spot-on', 'characterizations.Thus', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'yet', 'had', 'pleasure', 'may', 'be', 'highly', 'cliched', 'days', 'only', 'been', 'so', 'long', 'truly', 'amazing', 'film', 'only', 'get', 'better', 'time']",N/A
