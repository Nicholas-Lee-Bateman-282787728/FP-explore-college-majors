No one movie stands out as better than any of the others -- they were all great! I can't wait for more.

1278177,AC4HF3MKS35Y0,B002MGZBS6,"D. Clark ""Dan's Mom""","[2, 2]","I remember when the Star Trek movies were being made and released. Each time we'd see one, whether or not the critics loved or panned it, we could hardly wait for the next one. Same with the 007 movies over the years. These Jesse Stone movies give the same feeling: we love each one of them, some more than others, but we can hardly wait for the next one.Tom Selleck is perfect in the role of Jesse Stone. He just keeps getting better and better. Not only is he a gift for the eyes (of females) but his acting improves with every role he plays. William Devane is always a pleasure to see, and the other cast members, from Healy and Suitcase and Molly to all the others...they are great. Joe, the Golden Retriever, playing the role of Reggie, tugs at the heart with his expressions. The musical score is wonderful, with a haunting theme song.Can't say much more other than these movies are such a nice change from the usual junk on tv, and we considered them well worth the price of buying them to watch over and over again via DVD. As a matter of fact, tonight I'm ordering the entire set of five for our son as a Christmas gift. He likes Tom Selleck as much as the rest of the family does.",5,Looking forward to the next one.,1258761600,"11 21, 2009",2009,1190,"['remember', 'when', 'Star', 'Trek', 'movies', 'were', 'being', 'made', 'released', 'time', ""'d"", 'see', 'one', 'not', 'critics', 'loved', 'panned', 'could', 'hardly', 'wait', 'next', 'one', 'Same', '007', 'movies', 'years', 'Jesse', 'Stone', 'movies', 'give', 'same', 'feeling', 'love', 'one', 'more', 'others', 'can', 'hardly', 'wait', 'next', 'one.Tom', 'Selleck', 'perfect', 'role', 'Jesse', 'Stone', 'just', 'getting', 'better', 'better', 'Not', 'only', 'gift', 'eyes', 'females', 'acting', 'improves', 'role', 'William', 'Devane', 'always', 'pleasure', 'see', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'Healy', 'Suitcase', 'Molly', 'others', 'are', 'great', 'Joe', 'Golden', 'Retriever', 'playing', 'role', 'Reggie', 'tugs', 'heart', 'expressions', 'musical', 'score', 'wonderful', 'haunting', 'theme', 'song.Ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'more', 'other', 'movies', 'are', 'such', 'nice', 'change', 'usual', 'junk', 'tv', 'considered', 'well', 'price', 'buying', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'DVD', 'matter', 'fact', 'tonight', ""'m"", 'ordering', 'entire', 'set', 'five', 'son', 'Christmas', 'gift', 'Tom', 'Selleck', 'as', 'much', 'rest', 'family']",N/A
