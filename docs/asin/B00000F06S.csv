The problem is the quality of the DVD's, which is poor.Let's begin with the DVD sleeve cover image, which shows in sailor uniforms five men who are NOT in the film - I don't know why the producers of this set didn't simply do a screen capture of the scene from the film for this sleeve cover image, instead of substituting an image of five anonymous men who do not appear in the film.Then comes Disc One, whose subtitles would not switch off when I pressed my remote control to switch them off; and I found that all the other controls on the remote - pause, fast-forward, reverse, and even STOP (!) - did not work, and so  the movie just kept on playing through; and even when the film ended and the disc reverted to display the DVD menu, none of my remote's controls activated, or even navigated to, any of the options on the menu screen - and the STOP button on my remote would not stop the disc from menu display, so that I had to switch off the power to my disc player to get the disc to stop playing its menu display. Also, the film's subtitles suffer from several misspelling howlers, including, but not limited to, &#34;Road Island Red&#34; for the Sullivan family's Rhode Island Red hen, and &#34;Kathryn Mary&#34; for Al Sullivan's wife Katherine Mary.Then there's Disc Two, whose special featurs contain a great deal of fine pictorial and video historical material on the Sullivan brothers, their sister Genevieve, their mother and father, their life in Waterloo, Iowa, on their descendents, and on the museum devoted to the Sullivans in their Iowa hometown. The problem with the special feature videos is that they appear to have been taped originally with a videocassette recorder, and the video thus suffers from the limitation of that earlier technology, and suffers again from its transfer to the DVD medium: images are grainy, audio is muddy. The quality of the still images of old photos of the Sullivans and other special feature subjects is only fair.I don't know that the historical material in this two-disc set is available elsewhere on DVD, but it's all pretty muddy on this set, and yet it contains a great deal of information pertinent to the real Sullivans, so I have mixed feelings about this paradox purely because of the slapdash DVD production and because of the unresponsiveness of the DVD to my player's remote controls.",2,"Great Film, Slapdash Discs",1370649600,"06 8, 2013",2013,2645,"['two-disc', 'commemorative', 'edition', ""'The"", 'Fighting', 'Sullivans', 'contains', 'Disc', 'One', 'decent', 'print/transfer', 'title', 'film', 'Disc', 'Two', 'fine', 'selection', 'special', 'features', 'including', 'speeches', 'interviews', 'last', 'survivors', 'sinking', 'USS', 'Juneau', 'problem', 'quality', 'DVD', 'poor.Let', 'begin', 'DVD', 'sleeve', 'cover', 'image', 'sailor', 'uniforms', 'five', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'NOT', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'producers', 'set', 'did', ""n't"", 'simply', 'do', 'screen', 'capture', 'scene', 'film', 'sleeve', 'cover', 'image', 'instead', 'substituting', 'image', 'five', 'anonymous', 'men', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'appear', 'film.Then', 'Disc', 'One', 'subtitles', 'would', 'not', 'switch', 'off', 'when', 'pressed', 'remote', 'control', 'switch', 'off', 'found', 'other', 'controls', 'remote', 'pause', 'fast-forward', 'reverse', 'even', 'STOP', 'did', 'not', 'work', 'so', 'movie', 'just', 'kept', 'playing', 'even', 'when', 'film', 'ended', 'disc', 'reverted', 'display', 'DVD', 'menu', 'none', 'remote', 'controls', 'activated', 'even', 'navigated', 'options', 'menu', 'screen', 'STOP', 'button', 'remote', 'would', 'not', 'stop', 'disc', 'menu', 'display', 'had', 'switch', 'off', 'power', 'disc', 'player', 'get', 'disc', 'stop', 'playing', 'menu', 'display', 'Also', 'film', 'subtitles', 'suffer', 'several', 'misspelling', 'howlers', 'including', 'not', 'limited', '34', 'Road', 'Island', 'Red', '34', 'Sullivan', 'family', 'Rhode', 'Island', 'Red', 'hen', '34', 'Kathryn', 'Mary', '34', 'Al', 'Sullivan', 'wife', 'Katherine', 'Mary.Then', 'Disc', 'Two', 'special', 'featurs', 'contain', 'great', 'deal', 'fine', 'pictorial', 'video', 'historical', 'material', 'Sullivan', 'brothers', 'sister', 'Genevieve', 'mother', 'father', 'life', 'Waterloo', 'Iowa', 'descendents', 'museum', 'devoted', 'Sullivans', 'Iowa', 'hometown', 'problem', 'special', 'feature', 'videos', 'appear', 'have', 'been', 'taped', 'originally', 'videocassette', 'recorder', 'video', 'thus', 'suffers', 'limitation', 'earlier', 'technology', 'suffers', 'again', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'medium', 'images', 'are', 'grainy', 'audio', 'muddy', 'quality', 'still', 'images', 'old', 'photos', 'Sullivans', 'other', 'special', 'feature', 'subjects', 'only', 'fair.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'historical', 'material', 'two-disc', 'set', 'available', 'elsewhere', 'DVD', 'pretty', 'muddy', 'set', 'yet', 'great', 'deal', 'information', 'pertinent', 'real', 'Sullivans', 'so', 'have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'paradox', 'purely', 'slapdash', 'DVD', 'production', 'unresponsiveness', 'DVD', 'player', 'remote', 'controls']",The Fighting Sullivans VHS

The opening is cute as we are shown one baptism after another.  Those Irish Catholic families sure had the children back in the day.  But the movie focuses heavily on the antics of the boys when they are little.  Basically, they are a band of wild ruffians who had little supervision and got into fights and all kinds of predicaments.  The girl is stuck at home doing all the household chores like a slave, which is quite an eye opener and makes us women appreciate our improved lot nowadays.  And finally when they grow up we learn most of them didn't finish school (go figure, they ran around wild as youngsters) and they tease the youngest son mercilessly when he brings home his girlfriend.  She leaves the house crying and eventually the family is able to convince her that they were not telling the truth.  Their wedding and love story is a sweet one and one of the highlights of the film.  When the Japanese bomb Pearl Harbor the boys all go down to the Navy office and try to enlist, with the requirement that they all be together.  The officer doesn't guarantee it so they walk out.  But they return later with a letter from the top brass giving them permission to all be together and so they join the Navy on the same boat.  They get hit and have to abandon ship and in a touching a moment the boys all go back to get their brother who is in sick bay.  Thankfully, the scene goes black and we are spared any gore.  As the film closes with the Christening of a new ship as ""The Sullivans"" we are treated to the boys walking on clouds.  It is very touching and I'm sure meaningful to many who have lost any loved ones in war.  I just had a hard time getting past all the wildness of their youth.",1,Hard to sit through.,1329177600,"02 14, 2012",2012,1889,"['admire', 'fact', 'five', 'sons', 'went', 'war', 'country', 'feel', 'sorry', 'such', 'tragic', 'loss', 'family', 'found', 'movie', 'incredibly', 'difficult', 'sit', 'opening', 'cute', 'are', 'shown', 'one', 'baptism', 'Irish', 'Catholic', 'families', 'sure', 'had', 'children', 'back', 'day', 'movie', 'heavily', 'antics', 'boys', 'when', 'are', 'little', 'Basically', 'are', 'band', 'wild', 'ruffians', 'who', 'had', 'little', 'supervision', 'got', 'fights', 'kinds', 'predicaments', 'girl', 'stuck', 'home', 'doing', 'household', 'chores', 'slave', 'quite', 'eye', 'opener', 'women', 'appreciate', 'improved', 'lot', 'nowadays', 'finally', 'when', 'grow', 'learn', 'most', 'did', ""n't"", 'finish', 'school', 'go', 'figure', 'ran', 'around', 'wild', 'youngsters', 'tease', 'youngest', 'son', 'mercilessly', 'when', 'home', 'girlfriend', 'house', 'crying', 'eventually', 'family', 'able', 'convince', 'were', 'not', 'telling', 'truth', 'wedding', 'love', 'story', 'sweet', 'one', 'one', 'highlights', 'film', 'When', 'Japanese', 'bomb', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'boys', 'go', 'down', 'Navy', 'office', 'try', 'enlist', 'requirement', 'be', 'together', 'officer', ""n't"", 'guarantee', 'so', 'walk', 'return', 'later', 'letter', 'top', 'brass', 'giving', 'permission', 'be', 'together', 'so', 'join', 'Navy', 'same', 'boat', 'get', 'hit', 'have', 'abandon', 'ship', 'touching', 'moment', 'boys', 'go', 'back', 'get', 'brother', 'who', 'sick', 'bay', 'Thankfully', 'scene', 'black', 'are', 'spared', 'gore', 'film', 'Christening', 'new', 'ship', 'Sullivans', 'are', 'treated', 'boys', 'walking', 'clouds', 'very', 'touching', ""'m"", 'sure', 'meaningful', 'many', 'who', 'have', 'lost', 'loved', 'ones', 'war', 'just', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'getting', 'wildness', 'youth']",The Fighting Sullivans VHS
496201,A1S3C5OFU508P3,B00000F06S,Charles Ashbacher,"[6, 7]","Having lived in Iowa all my life, I have heard the phrase, ""the five Sullivan brothers"" many times. This movie is about their lives, and it is typical of boys who lived on a river at that time. They grew up in Waterloo, Iowa and when the United States entered world war II, their first response was to cuss the Japanese and their second was to decide which branch of the military they were going to join. However, they wanted to serve together, but navy rules did not allow all of the children of a family to be on the same ship. When the recruiter rejected their request, they wrote to the navy department and received a special dispensation so that they could all be on the same ship. That ship was torpedoed in the battle of Guadalcanal and sunk with all five of the Sullivan brothers perishing.This is a story about the joy of youth, where five boys are brothers, best friends and inseparable. They have a lot of fun, even when other boys are beating the tar out of them. Their life was that of any boys growing up on a river, they fished, swam and floated a boat every chance they got during the summer. While the movie is more than a little bit hokey, it has a feel good quality about it. They worked hard, played hard and at the end, they thought nothing of risking their lives for their country. It is fitting that the only ship ever named for more than one person was called the U. S. S.

496208,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B00000F06S,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 12]","One little war propaganda film that has a certain charm. The charm comes from the five brothers that can never do anything separately. By insisting on being the five of them on the same ship they were all killed at the same time. That is no heroism in itself. That is just slightly sad and moving. Never put all your eggs in the same basket. If that basket gets run over you lose all your eggs. Yet the film has a charm beyond that and the charm comes from the number five, for one, and the reversal of age order for two. Five is a strange number. The Sullivans are a good Catholic Irish family. So six should be a better number and actually it is reached with the daughter and that brings the family to eight, Christ in his glory. Note when the five boys are dead, if we take into account the wife of the youngest son and their son that makes five again. Five is a deeply pagan number associated with life, the enjoyment of life and here it is inverted by the tragic death of the five sons leaving five people behind them. That is also surprising because of the satanic dimension of this number in a catholic dimension, and this inversion is typically American: the revisiting and de-diabolizing of this number, especially since they become heroes and their name is given to a war ship. Note the last vision of them is a dream when the ship is christened: four sons at first in two groups of two and the fifth one, the only married one, the youngest one coming running after. And then this number five becomes the basic symbol of the western civilization, the five fingers of a hand, the five senses and so many other things that come in five, especially the five cent nickel. Apart from that the film is nothing but propaganda, even when showing the suffering of the survivors, parents, sister and wife: very soft suffering indeed.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",4,War propaganda ages very fast,1203379200,"02 19, 2008",2008,1969,"['One', 'little', 'war', 'propaganda', 'film', 'certain', 'charm', 'charm', 'five', 'brothers', 'can', 'never', 'do', 'anything', 'separately', 'insisting', 'being', 'five', 'same', 'ship', 'were', 'killed', 'same', 'time', 'heroism', 'just', 'slightly', 'sad', 'moving', 'Never', 'put', 'eggs', 'same', 'basket', 'basket', 'run', 'lose', 'eggs', 'film', 'charm', 'charm', 'number', 'five', 'one', 'reversal', 'age', 'order', 'two', 'Five', 'strange', 'number', 'Sullivans', 'are', 'good', 'Catholic', 'Irish', 'family', 'So', 'six', 'should', 'be', 'better', 'number', 'actually', 'reached', 'daughter', 'family', 'eight', 'Christ', 'glory', 'Note', 'when', 'five', 'boys', 'are', 'dead', 'take', 'account', 'wife', 'youngest', 'son', 'son', 'five', 'again', 'Five', 'deeply', 'pagan', 'number', 'associated', 'life', 'enjoyment', 'life', 'here', 'inverted', 'tragic', 'death', 'five', 'sons', 'leaving', 'five', 'people', 'also', 'surprising', 'satanic', 'dimension', 'number', 'catholic', 'dimension', 'inversion', 'typically', 'American', 'revisiting', 'de-diabolizing', 'number', 'especially', 'become', 'heroes', 'name', 'given', 'war', 'ship', 'Note', 'last', 'vision', 'dream', 'when', 'ship', 'christened', 'four', 'sons', 'first', 'two', 'groups', 'two', 'fifth', 'one', 'only', 'married', 'one', 'youngest', 'one', 'coming', 'running', 'then', 'number', 'five', 'basic', 'symbol', 'western', 'civilization', 'five', 'fingers', 'hand', 'five', 'senses', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'things', 'come', 'five', 'especially', 'five', 'cent', 'nickel', 'Apart', 'film', 'nothing', 'propaganda', 'even', 'when', 'showing', 'suffering', 'survivors', 'parents', 'sister', 'wife', 'very', 'soft', 'suffering', 'indeed.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', 'Dauphine', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Versailles', 'Saint', 'Quentin', 'Yvelines']",The Fighting Sullivans VHS

496210,A3KY68OTSNHM3G,B00000F06S,Jeffrey T. Munson,"[10, 10]","This excellent film tells the story of the five Sullivan brothers Al, Frank, George, Matt, and Joe from Waterloo, Iowa who signed up for the Navy after the attack on Pearl Harbor and requested to be assigned to the same ship.  The film encompasses their life from young children to their time in the service.Thomas Mitchell and Selena Royle star as Tom and Mrs. Sullivan; strong parents with a deep Irish heritage and great love for their five sons and one daughter Genevieve.  Tom ruled with a strong hand, but was always fair with his sons, and he let them learn from their mistakes.  One of the boys' great joys was running down to the water tower near the railroad tracks where Tom worked and waving to him as his train pulled away each day.  The Sullivans were typical young boys; getting into fights, bringing home a stray dog, or fixing an old boat and sailing it on the river.The film then proceeds to show the Sullivans in their late teens and early twenties.  They enjoyed racing motorcycles or working at the town's factory.  Al, the youngest of the boys, falls in love and eventually gets married and has a child.  After the bombing of Pearl Harbor, the boys go down to the local recruiting station and enlist in the Navy.  George, the oldest, wrote a letter to the Navy Department receiving permission for all of the brothers to serve together on the same ship.Time passes, and one fateful day, the Navy sends a spokesman to the Sullivan's home to deliver the tragic news that all five boys have been lost when their ship, the USS Juneau, was sunk off of Guadalcanal.  After this tragic accident, the navy forbid any siblings from serving on the same vessel.The last ten minutes are the most touching of the movie. After hearing the news, Tom Sullivan heads off to work just like any other day, but when he passes the water tower where his beloved sons gathered and waved to him every day, he stands at attention and, with tears in his eyes, delivers a snappy salute.  The end scene shows the five brothers dressed in their class A uniforms surrounded by clouds waving from the afterworld.  These two scenes are the most touching scenes that I can ever remember seeing in a movie.This movie is excellent from beginning to end.

Norberg,"[0, 0]","Amazingly, only the last 20 minutes of an almost 2-hour movie are sad, yet the whole movie builds up to that final dreadful situation, and you can't help but get emotional (that's a good thing, by the way. Everyone should get emotional every now and then.)The bulk of the movie is spent letting you ""get to know"" the Sullivan family--an Irish family full of scrappers. It's really quite cheesy and fluffy for the most part--until all five brothers determine they are going to help put a quick end to the war after Pearl Harbor. Of course, being a family that has always done everything together, they refused to enlist *unless* they could be guaranteed the same ship to serve aboard.The Sullivans got their wish, of course, and this resulted in one of the singular most tragic episodes of WW2 with all five brothers being lost aboard the same ship. The cover of the DVD points out how the movie almost depends on the fact that the audience knows the ending before the movie starts. I must admit it makes movies like this hard to watch, but it's worth it. Actually, my most emotional moment was after the news was given and everyone had left the room except for the mother and the Navy man (Ward Bond) who had to deliver the news. The man made a comment to the mother that was clearly made only for her benefit, and seeing her response brought tears to my eyes.Ultimately, the story should be told, and this film does a good job. The fact that it triumphantly ends was really somewhat of a surprise. I will leave the very end just in case there are people like me who didn't know that...!

496222,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00000F06S,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[107, 109]","&quot;The Fighting Sullivans&quot; is the true story of five brothers who died together when their Navy ship, the Juneau, was sunk in the South Pacific during World War II.  But only the last act of this 1944 film, directed by Lloyd Bacon, shows the Sullivans at war.  Most of this film is pure Americana, following the lives of the boys from their childhood in Waterloo, Iowa.  Thomas Mitchell and the marvelous Selena Royle are the loving parents, while the five boys are played by unknown actors: Edward Ryan (Al), John Campbell (Frank), James Cardwell (George), John Alvin (Matt), and George Offerman (Joe).  Trudy Marshall plays their only sister, Genevieve.  Top billing actually goes to Anne Baxter as the young girl who marries into the family and will be left a widow with a baby in arms.  Ward Bond plays the Navy lieutenant who befriends the family when the Sullivans insist that they will only join up if they can serve together.  Eventually the Navy relents and the boys get their wish.Audiences knew the tragic fate of the Sullivans, although the film was originally released as &quot;The Sullivans&quot; and pretty much bombed at the box office.  Retitled &quot;The Fighting Sullivans&quot; and re-released, it became a smash hit.  The use of unknown actors made the film all the more effective, especially since it refrained from the sort of cliches you would expect.  If the scene where the parents learn all five boys have died does not get you, the next scene will: Mr. Sullivan goes off to his job on the railroad and as the train passes the water tower where his boys waved to him as kids, he salutes them.  Actually, this film works so well that the final shot, of the Sullivans in uniform striding across the clouds of the afterlife does not seem one whit hokey.  There is a documentary available on the Sullivans, which tells how one of the boys survived the sinking before dying in the waters off of Guadacanal.  I would not have thought anything could have made this story more tragic, but that bit of information certainly made it worse for me.",5,An American family sends its five boys off to World War II,994464000,"07 7, 2001",2001,2071,"['quot', 'Fighting', 'Sullivans', 'quot', 'true', 'story', 'five', 'brothers', 'who', 'died', 'together', 'when', 'Navy', 'ship', 'Juneau', 'was', 'sunk', 'South', 'Pacific', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'only', 'last', 'act', '1944', 'film', 'directed', 'Lloyd', 'Bacon', 'Sullivans', 'war', 'Most', 'film', 'pure', 'Americana', 'following', 'lives', 'boys', 'childhood', 'Waterloo', 'Iowa', 'Thomas', 'Mitchell', 'marvelous', 'Selena', 'Royle', 'are', 'loving', 'parents', 'five', 'boys', 'are', 'played', 'unknown', 'actors', 'Edward', 'Ryan', 'Al', 'John', 'Campbell', 'Frank', 'James', 'Cardwell', 'George', 'John', 'Alvin', 'Matt', 'George', 'Offerman', 'Joe', 'Trudy', 'Marshall', 'only', 'sister', 'Genevieve', 'Top', 'billing', 'actually', 'Anne', 'Baxter', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'family', 'will', 'be', 'left', 'widow', 'baby', 'arms', 'Ward', 'Bond', 'Navy', 'lieutenant', 'who', 'family', 'when', 'Sullivans', 'insist', 'will', 'only', 'join', 'up', 'can', 'serve', 'together', 'Eventually', 'Navy', 'relents', 'boys', 'get', 'wish.Audiences', 'knew', 'tragic', 'fate', 'Sullivans', 'film', 'was', 'originally', 'released', 'quot', 'Sullivans', 'quot', 'pretty', 'much', 'bombed', 'box', 'office', 'Retitled', 'quot', 'Fighting', 'Sullivans', 'quot', 're-released', 'became', 'smash', 'hit', 'use', 'unknown', 'actors', 'made', 'film', 'more', 'effective', 'especially', 'refrained', 'sort', 'cliches', 'would', 'expect', 'scene', 'where', 'parents', 'learn', 'five', 'boys', 'have', 'died', 'not', 'get', 'next', 'scene', 'will', 'Mr.', 'Sullivan', 'job', 'railroad', 'train', 'water', 'tower', 'where', 'boys', 'waved', 'kids', 'Actually', 'film', 'so', 'well', 'final', 'shot', 'Sullivans', 'uniform', 'striding', 'clouds', 'afterlife', 'not', 'seem', 'one', 'whit', 'hokey', 'documentary', 'available', 'Sullivans', 'how', 'one', 'boys', 'survived', 'sinking', 'dying', 'waters', 'Guadacanal', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'thought', 'anything', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'story', 'more', 'tragic', 'bit', 'information', 'certainly', 'made', 'worse']",The Fighting Sullivans VHS

Though Roosevelt took the Prime Minister's warning under advisement, it came too late to prevent the devastating tragedy which befell a devout Irish-American family from Waterloo, Iowa, an incident which made headlines around the world in 1942.Lloyd Bacon's flag-waving melodrama THE SULLIVANS (1944) - released on DVD under its theatrical re-release title THE FIGHTING SULLIVANS - tells the true story of six children (five boys and a girl) who were raised by hard-working parents (played here by Thomas Mitchell and Selena Royle) and imbued with the kind of traditional values that audiences craved during wartime. Mary C. McCall Jr.'s episodic screenplay (based on an Oscar-nominated story by Jules Schermer and Edward Doherty) follows the children from birth to adolescence and young adulthood, recreating notable - and not so notable! - events in their lives as a means of illustrating their individual personalities. As children, they get into scrapes with other kids from the surrounding neighborhood, and as young adults they form relationships outside their close-knit family which are rudely interrupted by the bombing of Pearl Harbor. When the five boys go off to war and the inevitable tragedy strikes, unprepared viewers might feel like they've just been hit by an express train. In fact, the last fifteen minutes of the film are so utterly heartbreaking (particularly the 'water tower' sequence), many theater owners refused to screen the movie until after the war was over, believing it would be too painful for families who had lost loved ones on the front line. Half a century later, Steven Spielberg would pay tribute to the Sullivan family by using their experience as a springboard for his own wartime melodrama, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (1998).Nevertheless, THE SULLIVANS was a modest success in its day, thanks to its stirring patriotism and heartfelt emotion. Director Bacon (a veteran craftsman who had begun his career in silent films before making a name for himself during the sound era with the likes of 42nd STREET [1933]) tells the story in straightforward fashion, spurning flashy camera tricks in favor of a low-key visual style, employing close-ups and tracking shots purely for dramatic emphasis at key points in the narrative. Bacon also uses an instrumental version of the old military standard 'Anchors Away' to particularly memorable effect during the latter stages of the film - some will find it corny, others will be deeply moved; either response is valid.Production values are economical but solid, and the cast is a mixed bag, spearheaded by veterans Royle (THE HEIRESS [1949]) and Mitchell (one of Hollywood's most celebrated character actors, usually a supporting player in A-list productions like GONE WITH THE WIND [1939] and IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE [1946]), while Anne Baxter - so memorable in Orson Welles' THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS [1942] - toplines the younger cast in a thankless minor role. The five Sullivan boys are played by relative unknowns and their performances are pretty variable, though the young actors who play them as children aren't even credited on-screen! Chief amongst them is Bobby Driscoll (as the youngest Sullivan boy), a hugely talented child star who won an Oscar for his role in Ted Tetzlaff's superb thriller THE WINDOW (1949) and later provided the voice of the title character in Disney's PETER PAN (1953) before his life was tragically cut short by a drugs overdose in 1968. Further down the cast list in a small but crucial role is Ward Bond, playing a navy officer who utters the single most wrenching line of dialogue in the entire film (""All five""). Though virtually forgotten today, Bond appeared in almost 300 movies during the course of his long career, lending an element of quiet dignity to every role he ever played.NB. Shortly after the events described in this film, President Roosevelt finally decreed that family members would no longer be allowed to serve together in the US military.
