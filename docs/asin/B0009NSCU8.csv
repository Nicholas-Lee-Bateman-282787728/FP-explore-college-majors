908740,AXGMP2PTX1WH6,B0009NSCU8,douglas martin,"[2, 2]","Pay no attention to the one star review. This is a very funny show especially if you've ever worked in a restaurant. Garrett is a typical chef - an arrogant, self important S.O.B. - but very funny. Him calling the wait staff morons is how most chefs feel - believe me I'm a waiter (moron). The rest of the staff are typical of a high end restaurant. I hope you enjoy this show - season 3 is not as funny but still watchable- as much as I did.

None of the reviews included ""canned laughter"" and had I known that, it would not have been a program I would have watched or a DVD that I would have bought. This is an AWFUL show! The actors are corny and in need of lessons, but if you enjoy a program with canned laughter, this is the show for you.

908747,A3OB3WDUN51D8A,B0009NSCU8,Sterling,"[2, 2]","The show is primarily about an imperious chef and his staff, running a kitchen in an upscale French cuisine restaurant. The pompous, ""Britain's finest"" Chef frequently bursts out in eloquent oratory, mainly on how low his lowlife employees are. The Chef is a perfectionist, to the extent that he will ignore the law by buying illegal, unpasteurized Stilton cheese to get the taste he wants. Then there is his beautiful wife, trying to reign-in his excessive spending on ingredients and feeling somewhat neglected. What is a bit unusual is that with one minor exception the show does not involve wine.The writing is witty, engaging and sophisticated. It derives its humor from plausible situations, rather than stuff like sticking pencils in your nose to get a laugh, and it does not use profanity or vulgarity. The episodes are amusing, there are many funny moments, but you will not fall out of your chair laughing. To those more familiar with the culinary arts, there are more humorous moments in the preparation of certain dishes.One thing the show does, it makes you want to cook, or at least eat something really delicious. Also, the people with high blood pressure who put salt on their food only in their dreams, may find the show helpful, as the Chef presents a most compelling and rational case against salting food. After watching that, one may feel perfectly fine not using salt and liking it.",4,A delicious comedy,1247788800,"07 17, 2009",2009,1404,"['show', 'primarily', 'imperious', 'chef', 'staff', 'running', 'kitchen', 'upscale', 'French', 'cuisine', 'restaurant', 'pompous', 'Britain', 'finest', 'Chef', 'frequently', 'out', 'eloquent', 'oratory', 'mainly', 'how', 'low', 'lowlife', 'employees', 'are', 'Chef', 'perfectionist', 'extent', 'will', 'ignore', 'law', 'buying', 'illegal', 'unpasteurized', 'Stilton', 'cheese', 'get', 'taste', 'Then', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'trying', 'reign-in', 'excessive', 'spending', 'ingredients', 'feeling', 'somewhat', 'neglected', 'What', 'bit', 'unusual', 'one', 'minor', 'exception', 'show', 'not', 'involve', 'wine.The', 'writing', 'witty', 'engaging', 'sophisticated', 'humor', 'plausible', 'situations', 'rather', 'stuff', 'sticking', 'pencils', 'nose', 'get', 'laugh', 'not', 'use', 'profanity', 'vulgarity', 'episodes', 'are', 'amusing', 'are', 'many', 'funny', 'moments', 'will', 'not', 'fall', 'chair', 'laughing', 'more', 'familiar', 'culinary', 'arts', 'are', 'more', 'humorous', 'moments', 'preparation', 'certain', 'dishes.One', 'thing', 'show', 'want', 'cook', 'least', 'eat', 'something', 'really', 'delicious', 'Also', 'people', 'high', 'blood', 'pressure', 'who', 'put', 'salt', 'food', 'only', 'dreams', 'may', 'find', 'show', 'helpful', 'Chef', 'most', 'compelling', 'rational', 'case', 'salting', 'food', 'watching', 'one', 'may', 'feel', 'perfectly', 'fine', 'not', 'using', 'salt', 'liking']",Chef! - The Complete Series One
