1157877,A3F8LMJKR5HAH4,B0017UOU58,Annie,"[0, 0]","I LOVE this workout!  i started with it on exercise tv on demand and i've already decided to buy it when it is no longer available there.  when i started out i could barely get through it but now i find it challenging and refreshing.  the music is good, the background is beautiful, and the instructor's voice is relaxing to listen to. my thighs and buns already show more definition.  i just wish it was a little longer but sometimes i rewind it and go through the entire routine an extra time.Update: I was given this DVD off my wishlist and had to change my review to 3 stars instead of 4 because the full workout is very slow and not cardio by anyone's definition (or dance).  the workout I had done before was the express workout which I still really like doing.  And the bonus yoga stretch is pretty good.  But I honestly don't think I will do the full workout again because I didn't care for it.  And in the full workout she does have some strange phrases that she repeats a lot. I thought it would be the same as the express workout just longer but it is completely different.",3,Excellent Yoga Workout,1228176000,"12 2, 2008",2008,1084,"['LOVE', 'workout', 'i', 'started', 'exercise', 'tv', 'demand', 'i', ""'ve"", 'already', 'decided', 'buy', 'when', 'no', 'longer', 'available', 'there', 'when', 'i', 'started', 'out', 'i', 'could', 'barely', 'get', 'now', 'find', 'challenging', 'refreshing', 'music', 'good', 'background', 'beautiful', 'instructor', 'voice', 'relaxing', 'listen', 'thighs', 'buns', 'already', 'show', 'more', 'definition', 'i', 'just', 'wish', 'was', 'little', 'longer', 'sometimes', 'i', 'rewind', 'go', 'entire', 'routine', 'extra', 'time.Update', 'was', 'given', 'DVD', 'wishlist', 'had', 'change', 'review', '3', 'stars', 'instead', '4', 'full', 'workout', 'very', 'slow', 'not', 'cardio', 'anyone', 'definition', 'dance', 'workout', 'had', 'done', 'before', 'was', 'express', 'still', 'really', 'doing', 'bonus', 'yoga', 'stretch', 'pretty', 'good', 'honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'will', 'do', 'full', 'workout', 'again', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'full', 'workout', 'have', 'strange', 'phrases', 'lot', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'same', 'express', 'workout', 'just', 'longer', 'completely', 'different']",Cardio Burn Yoga

The yoga practice actually moves very slowly through each pose and I enjoyed the practice very much. The instructor is very good and positive but she was too chatty for my taste. Some people may not be bothered by that because she is a very likeable person.",3,"No cardio, but good yoga",1266364800,"02 17, 2010",2010,371,"['yoga', 'practice', 'far', 'cardio', 'can', 'possibly', 'get', 'think', 'title', 'DVD', 'misleading', 'yoga', 'practice', 'actually', 'very', 'slowly', 'pose', 'enjoyed', 'practice', 'very', 'much', 'instructor', 'very', 'good', 'positive', 'was', 'too', 'chatty', 'taste', 'people', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'bothered', 'very', 'likeable', 'person']",Cardio Burn Yoga

I even had to turn the sound off.  I will probably NEVER do this one again.Now, there is a bonus express workout that actually was not too bad.  Still was not close to a tough yoga workout, but MUCH improved and she kept her silly phrases to a minimum.  The bonus stretch was okay.  I can do these 2 bonus features infrequently.Due to her EXTREME cheesiness and turtle-moving-rate for the main workout, I will NEVER buy any products with Patricia Moreno.",2,Where is the cardio??,1292716800,"12 19, 2010",2010,610,"['Maybe', 'cardio', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'worked', 'out.The', 'main', 'work', 'out', 'was', 'very', 'slow', 'Patricia', 'cheesy', 'sayings', 'were', 'really', 'starting', 'make', 'gag', 'even', 'had', 'turn', 'sound', 'will', 'probably', 'NEVER', 'do', 'one', 'again.Now', 'bonus', 'express', 'actually', 'was', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'Still', 'was', 'not', 'close', 'tough', 'yoga', 'workout', 'MUCH', 'improved', 'kept', 'silly', 'phrases', 'minimum', 'bonus', 'stretch', 'was', 'okay', 'can', 'do', '2', 'bonus', 'features', 'infrequently.Due', 'EXTREME', 'cheesiness', 'turtle-moving-rate', 'main', 'workout', 'will', 'NEVER', 'buy', 'products', 'Patricia', 'Moreno']",Cardio Burn Yoga
1157881,A1X1R9KGM2PI6I,B0017UOU58,Missoops,"[4, 6]","The 30 minute workout is an excellent calorie burner. The series is a little repetitive (lots of lunges), but that makes it easy to follow, and it isn't so bad that it gets boring. A couple of places are uneven on the two sides: Once she tells you to put the right foot back instead of the left, and another area where she does high lunge on one side and not the other. I also don't love the balance series, mostly because she tells you to put your foot on your knee during tree, and I've always heard that your foot should either be just above or just below your knee, never on it. I do like her voice, the ""beat"" to the workout, and the fact that it really gets me sweating and even breathing a little heavy. I haven't made it through the longer workout because I get bored after about 15 or 20 minutes. It isn't as intense, and the moves seem more dance-based than yoga, which some people may like, but didn't work for me.",3,"Liked the Short Workout, but not the long one",1312588800,"08 6, 2011",2011,925,"['30', 'minute', 'workout', 'excellent', 'calorie', 'burner', 'series', 'little', 'repetitive', 'lots', 'lunges', 'easy', 'follow', ""n't"", 'so', 'bad', 'boring', 'couple', 'places', 'are', 'uneven', 'two', 'sides', 'Once', 'put', 'right', 'foot', 'back', 'instead', 'left', 'area', 'where', 'high', 'lunge', 'one', 'side', 'not', 'other', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'love', 'balance', 'series', 'mostly', 'put', 'foot', 'knee', 'tree', ""'ve"", 'always', 'heard', 'foot', 'should', 'either', 'be', 'just', 'just', 'knee', 'never', 'do', 'voice', 'beat', 'workout', 'fact', 'really', 'sweating', 'even', 'breathing', 'little', 'heavy', 'have', ""n't"", 'made', 'longer', 'workout', 'get', 'bored', '15', '20', 'minutes', ""n't"", 'intense', 'moves', 'seem', 'more', 'dance-based', 'yoga', 'people', 'may', 'like', 'did', ""n't"", 'work']",Cardio Burn Yoga
