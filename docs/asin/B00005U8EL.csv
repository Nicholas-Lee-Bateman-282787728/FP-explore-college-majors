683437,A15G57AIKJ5PRQ,B00005U8EL,"A. C. Walter ""awalter""","[56, 61]","&quot;O&quot; sets the tragedy of &quot;Othello&quot; in a modern high school where Odin James, the only black kid in a high school full of rich white kids, has been brought to the school for his skill on the basketball court.  He is about to lead his team through the playoffs, and he has recently won the love of a dean's daughter, Desi.  However, the coach's angry son Hugo is also on the team.  Neglected by his father and overshadowed by Odin, Hugo forms a vicious plan, resulting in a bloody and all too familiar disaster.The filmmakers pull no punches and opt for a fairly straight adaptation, doing an admirable job of staying true to the Shakespeare's plot and characters while avoiding his language in favor of an entirely original script. Though rap music, guns, drugs, cars, and the basketball court do figure into the story, these modern trappings never overshadow the human drama. Director Tim Blake Nelson lets his camera tell the story in a refreshingly simple manner, refusing the typical gimmickry of modern cinema; and a very solid cast carries the story well. Josh Hartnett as Hugo is perhaps the most outstanding--his angsty Ivy League face, reminiscent of Ethan Hawke and Robert Sean Leonard, always captures the bitter essence of his character.Though the film was completed in 1998, the release of &quot;0&quot; was repeatedly delayed due to the rash of high school shootings in the late 1990s. While it is understandable that such incidents of youth violence should make film studios cautious, this is one film which stands apart with a mature and timeless message about hate and the seeds of tragedy.",4,An insightful retelling of Shakespeare's &quot;Othello.&quot;,991008000,"05 28, 2001",2001,1625,"['quot', 'O', 'quot', 'tragedy', 'quot', 'Othello', 'quot', 'modern', 'high', 'school', 'where', 'Odin', 'James', 'only', 'black', 'kid', 'high', 'school', 'full', 'rich', 'white', 'kids', 'been', 'brought', 'school', 'skill', 'basketball', 'court', 'lead', 'team', 'playoffs', 'recently', 'won', 'love', 'dean', 'daughter', 'Desi', 'However', 'coach', 'angry', 'son', 'Hugo', 'also', 'team', 'Neglected', 'father', 'overshadowed', 'Odin', 'Hugo', 'vicious', 'plan', 'resulting', 'bloody', 'too', 'familiar', 'disaster.The', 'filmmakers', 'pull', 'punches', 'opt', 'fairly', 'straight', 'adaptation', 'doing', 'admirable', 'job', 'staying', 'true', 'Shakespeare', 'plot', 'characters', 'avoiding', 'language', 'favor', 'entirely', 'original', 'script', 'rap', 'music', 'guns', 'drugs', 'cars', 'basketball', 'court', 'do', 'figure', 'story', 'modern', 'trappings', 'never', 'overshadow', 'human', 'drama', 'Director', 'Tim', 'Blake', 'Nelson', 'camera', 'tell', 'story', 'refreshingly', 'simple', 'manner', 'refusing', 'typical', 'gimmickry', 'modern', 'cinema', 'very', 'solid', 'cast', 'story', 'well', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'Hugo', 'perhaps', 'most', 'outstanding', 'angsty', 'Ivy', 'League', 'face', 'reminiscent', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'Robert', 'Sean', 'Leonard', 'always', 'bitter', 'essence', 'character.Though', 'film', 'was', 'completed', '1998', 'release', 'quot', '0', 'quot', 'was', 'repeatedly', 'delayed', 'due', 'rash', 'high', 'school', 'shootings', 'late', '1990s', 'understandable', 'such', 'incidents', 'youth', 'violence', 'should', 'make', 'film', 'studios', 'cautious', 'one', 'film', 'apart', 'mature', 'timeless', 'message', 'hate', 'seeds', 'tragedy']",O

683441,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005U8EL,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","I say original despite knowing full well that this is an adaptation of Shakespeare's `Othello', but this take feels remarkably fresh thanks to convincing portrayals of key characters by talented young actors.  It doesn't hurt that the textural context of Shakespeare's story fits modern-day elements like a glove.This just works.In this retelling (or reimagining) we are introduced to Odin James, the star basketball player at a private school where he is the only African American student.  His best friend and fellow teammate is Hugo, the fiendish reincarnation of Iago.  Odin is dating the dean's daughter Desi, a beautiful and virtuous young woman who loves Odin deeply.  Feeling the sharp sting of jealousy, Hugo concocts a plan to destroy Odin by eroding his confidence, planting seeds of doubt that slowly corrode his happiness and provoke him to lash out in, resulting in an end we wish would never come.I would have never thought that Tim Blake Nelson would direct a film of this nature, and that he would do it so effectively, but the man knows all about restraint apparently since this film is just drenched in it.  That may seem like a misrepresentation, since the films glaring themes are certainly forthright and the film is bold enough to chuck any and all candy coated sympathies to the corner (the film is R rated and earns that rating) but what Nelson does do here is allow the inner manipulations of the characters to strike the audience eloquently, giving them truly felt development and not stereotypical and clich&eacute;d `roles'.  These characters develop in front of us, baring their teeth and showing their true colors magnificently.  The modern twists are also effectively transferred into Shakespeare's prose, allowing the modern elements to take a back seat to the core representation of human emotions, but never allowing the relevance to become lost in the original text.And then there are the performances, all of which are noteworthy.  Julia Stiles (WHY HAVE YOU FORSAKEN ME?) was once my dream actress.  In the early 00's she barreled out of the gate with so many promising projects that projected her talent like a beacon.  She did a lot of Shakespeare (not only was she in `O' but she was also in that horrendous `Hamlet' remake with Ethan Hawke and '10 Things I Hate About You', which is not only one of my favorite teen comedies but it is also adapted from `The Taming of the Shrew') and she did it well.  This is no exception.  Her heartbreak is devastating to watch.  As devastating as she is, Mekhi Phifer one-ups her by layering his breakdown with so many emotional lapses.  He really dissects this character flawlessly.  Josh Hartnett though is the clear standout.  What he does with Hugo is remarkable.  He just sinks his teeth into this character, divulging his selfish pursuits with a level of intensity and honesty that allows you to see his own plotting lifting up over his head.  His facial expressions throughout this entire film, but especially in the end as his plan escalates out of control, tell a story as old as time and one that is still poignant today.Some may balk at a film like `O' taking a classic and reinventing it so severely, but `O' is faithful to Shakespeare's vision and merely makes it increasingly more accessible to today's culture.Highly recommended.",5,O-riginal and underrated...,1300320000,"03 17, 2011",2011,3323,"['say', 'original', 'knowing', 'full', 'well', 'adaptation', 'Shakespeare', 'Othello', 'take', 'remarkably', 'fresh', 'thanks', 'convincing', 'portrayals', 'key', 'characters', 'talented', 'young', 'actors', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'textural', 'context', 'Shakespeare', 'story', 'modern-day', 'elements', 'glove.This', 'just', 'works.In', 'retelling', 'reimagining', 'are', 'introduced', 'Odin', 'James', 'star', 'basketball', 'player', 'private', 'school', 'where', 'only', 'African', 'American', 'student', 'best', 'friend', 'fellow', 'teammate', 'Hugo', 'fiendish', 'reincarnation', 'Iago', 'Odin', 'dating', 'dean', 'daughter', 'Desi', 'beautiful', 'virtuous', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'Odin', 'deeply', 'Feeling', 'sharp', 'sting', 'jealousy', 'Hugo', 'plan', 'destroy', 'Odin', 'eroding', 'confidence', 'planting', 'seeds', 'doubt', 'slowly', 'corrode', 'happiness', 'provoke', 'lash', 'out', 'resulting', 'end', 'wish', 'would', 'never', 'come.I', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'thought', 'Tim', 'Blake', 'Nelson', 'would', 'direct', 'film', 'nature', 'would', 'do', 'so', 'effectively', 'man', 'restraint', 'apparently', 'film', 'just', 'drenched', 'may', 'seem', 'misrepresentation', 'films', 'glaring', 'themes', 'are', 'certainly', 'forthright', 'film', 'bold', 'enough', 'chuck', 'candy', 'coated', 'sympathies', 'corner', 'film', 'R', 'rated', 'rating', 'what', 'Nelson', 'do', 'here', 'inner', 'manipulations', 'characters', 'strike', 'audience', 'eloquently', 'giving', 'truly', 'felt', 'development', 'not', 'stereotypical', 'clich', 'eacute', 'roles', 'characters', 'develop', 'front', 'baring', 'teeth', 'showing', 'true', 'colors', 'magnificently', 'modern', 'twists', 'are', 'also', 'effectively', 'transferred', 'Shakespeare', 'prose', 'allowing', 'modern', 'elements', 'take', 'back', 'seat', 'core', 'representation', 'human', 'emotions', 'never', 'allowing', 'relevance', 'become', 'lost', 'original', 'text.And', 'then', 'are', 'performances', 'are', 'noteworthy', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'WHY', 'HAVE', 'YOU', 'FORSAKEN', 'ME', 'was', 'once', 'dream', 'actress', 'early', '00', 'barreled', 'out', 'gate', 'so', 'many', 'promising', 'projects', 'projected', 'talent', 'beacon', 'did', 'lot', 'Shakespeare', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'O', 'was', 'also', 'horrendous', 'Hamlet', 'remake', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', ""'10"", 'Things', 'Hate', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'favorite', 'teen', 'comedies', 'also', 'adapted', 'Taming', 'Shrew', 'did', 'well', 'exception', 'heartbreak', 'devastating', 'watch', 'As', 'devastating', 'Mekhi', 'Phifer', 'layering', 'breakdown', 'so', 'many', 'emotional', 'lapses', 'really', 'character', 'flawlessly', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'clear', 'standout', 'What', 'Hugo', 'remarkable', 'just', 'sinks', 'teeth', 'character', 'divulging', 'selfish', 'pursuits', 'level', 'intensity', 'honesty', 'see', 'own', 'plotting', 'lifting', 'up', 'head', 'facial', 'expressions', 'entire', 'film', 'especially', 'end', 'plan', 'control', 'tell', 'story', 'as', 'old', 'time', 'one', 'still', 'poignant', 'today.Some', 'may', 'balk', 'film', 'O', 'taking', 'classic', 'reinventing', 'so', 'severely', 'O', 'faithful', 'Shakespeare', 'vision', 'merely', 'increasingly', 'more', 'accessible', 'today', 'culture.Highly', 'recommended']",O

When the Texas film was made, the issues of that time's generation weren't violent based or too melodramatic; it was just an attempt of having a meaningful place in society. But in O, the issues are taken blown out of proportions, seriously enough that violence is warranted to resolve them. Actually, that's how people are doing it today. Now, that's a good film considering I had a very high expectations prior to watching it because of that sleek DVD cover. The acting holds up very well, and even the invariably terrible actor Josh Harnett manages to rise to the occasion. In the last fifteen minutes, my only issue is that there is a state championship(?) game being played; surely everybody would automatically know it and assume all will be there.

Litton,"[40, 45]","Never having seen or read William Shakespeare's play &quot;Othello,&quot; I was unsure what to expect from &quot;O,&quot; a film that begins somewhat slowly, and then kicks into a higher gear as the plot thickens. This modern update of the classic play pays a great tribute to the work of Shakespeare, while also featuring some very well-wrought performances and a third act that is disturbing and affecting at the same time.Taking place in Charleston, South Carolina, at the high-class Palmetto Grove prep school, the film begins with a basketball game as Odin James (Mekhi Phifer), brings the team to yet another victory, while the wildly jealous Hugo (Josh Hartnett) looks on from the sidelines. Odin's fame among his teammates and fellow students, not to mention his stable relationship with Desi Brable (Julia Stiles), the daughter of the school's headmaster, enrages Hugo, who keeps his cool and concocts a plan of earning Odin's fame for himself.At this point, the actors have proved themselves very worthy of the film's many complex emotions. Phifer is also able to convince us of Odin's inner strength and sense of devotion to Desi, and Stiles mirrors these attributes in her character. The two share a warm and inviting chemistry seen little in films of a teenage nature; this is due in large part to the time the movie devotes to the developing of their relationship. This drawn-out approach may seem a bit tedious, but it serves to better the film by enhancing our connection with these two characters.It is Josh Hartnett, however, who steals most of the show as Hugo, instilling in him a subtle sense of deception that can be quite chilling. Hartnett handles the material just as it needs to be, in a calm, laid-back fashion. Hugo is the type of person who steps on those around him to get where he wants to be, and for this to work, he must show no emotion over the actions he takes; Hartnett captures this trait beautifully.As Hugo's jealousy grows, so do his evil plans. He involves many others in his quest for revenge; when fellow teammate Michael is temporarily kicked off the team, Hugo offers a glimmer of hope by suggesting that he get Desi to convince Odin to suggest to the coach that he be reinstated. Hugo then plays on Odin's doubts, filling him with suggestions that Desi may be sharing more than just friendship with Michael.This begins an increasingly fascinating descent into untruths, deceit, and evil, as each character becomes involved in a final plot twist that will decide each of their fates. This, accompanied by the slowly progressing beginning and middle, make this one of the best Shakespeare reworkings I've seen to date. Everything about the film rings true to his work, right down to the dialogue, which, even in its modern state, evokes the tones and emotions that his original writings also do.That final act is what almost kept the film from reaching the silver screen. Filmed before the Columbine High School disaster, the film was shelved for fear that it would create a stir after that most brutal act. Seeing it now makes it that much more effective; it takes teenage issues, like jealousy, loyalty, betrayal, trust, and love, and casts them into a light that no other film would dare touch. The violence that permeates the film's ending is gratuitous, yes, but it also serves as a warning sign of just how out of control our society can be.&quot;O&quot; can be considered an unconventional teenage film, due to its daring approach, and its success in carrying out that approach in a convincing manner. Its lead actors are able to sell us on the characters they play, while the story itself stays in touch with the many messages embodied in all of Shakespeare's works. At first, I found the film somewhat tiresome; upon further thought, it gains luster.",4,&quot;O&quot; is eye-opening and mind-blowing.,1000080000,"09 10, 2001",2001,3804,"['Never', 'having', 'seen', 'read', 'William', 'Shakespeare', 'play', 'quot', 'Othello', 'quot', 'was', 'unsure', 'what', 'expect', 'quot', 'O', 'quot', 'film', 'somewhat', 'slowly', 'then', 'kicks', 'higher', 'gear', 'plot', 'modern', 'update', 'classic', 'play', 'great', 'tribute', 'work', 'Shakespeare', 'also', 'featuring', 'very', 'well-wrought', 'performances', 'third', 'act', 'disturbing', 'affecting', 'same', 'time.Taking', 'place', 'Charleston', 'South', 'Carolina', 'high-class', 'Palmetto', 'Grove', 'prep', 'school', 'film', 'basketball', 'game', 'Odin', 'James', 'Mekhi', 'Phifer', 'team', 'yet', 'victory', 'wildly', 'jealous', 'Hugo', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'sidelines', 'Odin', 'fame', 'teammates', 'fellow', 'students', 'not', 'mention', 'stable', 'relationship', 'Desi', 'Brable', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'daughter', 'school', 'headmaster', 'Hugo', 'who', 'cool', 'plan', 'earning', 'Odin', 'fame', 'himself.At', 'point', 'actors', 'have', 'proved', 'very', 'worthy', 'film', 'many', 'complex', 'emotions', 'Phifer', 'also', 'able', 'convince', 'Odin', 'inner', 'strength', 'sense', 'devotion', 'Desi', 'Stiles', 'mirrors', 'attributes', 'character', 'two', 'share', 'warm', 'inviting', 'chemistry', 'seen', 'little', 'films', 'teenage', 'nature', 'due', 'large', 'part', 'time', 'movie', 'developing', 'relationship', 'drawn-out', 'approach', 'may', 'seem', 'bit', 'tedious', 'better', 'film', 'enhancing', 'connection', 'two', 'characters.It', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'however', 'who', 'most', 'show', 'Hugo', 'instilling', 'subtle', 'sense', 'deception', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'chilling', 'Hartnett', 'material', 'just', 'be', 'calm', 'laid-back', 'fashion', 'Hugo', 'type', 'person', 'who', 'get', 'where', 'be', 'work', 'must', 'show', 'emotion', 'actions', 'Hartnett', 'trait', 'Hugo', 'jealousy', 'grows', 'so', 'do', 'evil', 'plans', 'many', 'others', 'quest', 'revenge', 'when', 'fellow', 'teammate', 'Michael', 'temporarily', 'kicked', 'off', 'team', 'Hugo', 'glimmer', 'hope', 'suggesting', 'get', 'Desi', 'convince', 'Odin', 'suggest', 'coach', 'be', 'reinstated', 'Hugo', 'then', 'Odin', 'doubts', 'filling', 'suggestions', 'Desi', 'may', 'be', 'sharing', 'more', 'just', 'friendship', 'Michael.This', 'increasingly', 'fascinating', 'descent', 'untruths', 'deceit', 'evil', 'character', 'involved', 'final', 'plot', 'twist', 'will', 'decide', 'fates', 'accompanied', 'slowly', 'progressing', 'beginning', 'middle', 'make', 'one', 'best', 'Shakespeare', 'reworkings', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'date', 'Everything', 'film', 'rings', 'true', 'work', 'right', 'down', 'dialogue', 'even', 'modern', 'state', 'tones', 'emotions', 'original', 'writings', 'also', 'do.That', 'final', 'act', 'what', 'almost', 'kept', 'film', 'reaching', 'silver', 'screen', 'Filmed', 'Columbine', 'High', 'School', 'disaster', 'film', 'was', 'shelved', 'fear', 'would', 'create', 'stir', 'most', 'brutal', 'act', 'Seeing', 'now', 'much', 'more', 'effective', 'teenage', 'issues', 'jealousy', 'loyalty', 'betrayal', 'trust', 'love', 'light', 'other', 'film', 'would', 'dare', 'touch', 'violence', 'film', 'ending', 'gratuitous', 'yes', 'also', 'warning', 'sign', 'just', 'how', 'control', 'society', 'can', 'be.', 'quot', 'O', 'quot', 'can', 'be', 'considered', 'unconventional', 'teenage', 'film', 'due', 'daring', 'approach', 'success', 'carrying', 'out', 'approach', 'convincing', 'manner', 'lead', 'actors', 'are', 'able', 'sell', 'characters', 'play', 'story', 'touch', 'many', 'messages', 'embodied', 'Shakespeare', 'works', 'first', 'found', 'film', 'somewhat', 'tiresome', 'further', 'thought', 'gains', 'luster']",O

683453,AC9B29BXXWJHD,B00005U8EL,Ellis Bell,"[20, 21]","Those who are familiar with the play Othello will have no trouble guessing what happens in this dark tale of jealously and desire. How it happens, though, is a completely different story, and it is interesting to see how this timeless classic plays itself out.O is an excellent (albeit haunting) rendition of the Shakespeare play, with Mekhi Pheiffer in the title role as the stellar athlete Odin (Othello) who finds himself the only black student at an elite boarding school. Josh Hartnett is Hugo (Iago), the jealous, brooding teammate who tries to steal Odin's fire. Julia Styles is Desi (Desdemona), and the rest of the cast does an excellent job of rounding this trio out.There were two things about this movie which are of some importance. The scarf, for one (which also appears in the play). It seems to take on a life of its own, as Odin becomes more and more outraged at the idea that Desi might be cheating on him with his teammate Mike, the passion becoming so consuming that he can't control himself. The other was the hawk, the school mascot. Hugo compares himself and Odin repeatedly to the hawk- how the hawk has to soar and be independent.The movie does an excellent job of transposing Shakespeare's ideas to the big screen and into modern language. Take, for example, the scene in which Hugo tries to plant seeds of doubt in Odin's mind about his girlfriend's fidelity. Here, the schene takes place in a weight room, and Josh Harnett, in that kind of sexy, seductive way he has, is wonderfully sly and manipulative. In this he does a far better job than Kenneth Branaugh did in the 1995 film.",5,"O, if only other renditions could be as fine as this!",1095984000,"09 24, 2004",2004,1609,"['who', 'are', 'familiar', 'play', 'Othello', 'will', 'have', 'trouble', 'guessing', 'what', 'dark', 'tale', 'jealously', 'desire', 'How', 'though', 'completely', 'different', 'story', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'timeless', 'classic', 'out.O', 'excellent', 'haunting', 'rendition', 'Shakespeare', 'play', 'Mekhi', 'Pheiffer', 'title', 'role', 'stellar', 'athlete', 'Odin', 'Othello', 'who', 'only', 'black', 'student', 'elite', 'boarding', 'school', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'Hugo', 'Iago', 'jealous', 'brooding', 'teammate', 'who', 'steal', 'Odin', 'fire', 'Julia', 'Styles', 'Desi', 'Desdemona', 'rest', 'cast', 'excellent', 'job', 'rounding', 'trio', 'were', 'two', 'things', 'movie', 'are', 'importance', 'scarf', 'one', 'also', 'play', 'take', 'life', 'own', 'Odin', 'more', 'more', 'outraged', 'idea', 'Desi', 'might', 'be', 'cheating', 'teammate', 'Mike', 'passion', 'becoming', 'so', 'consuming', 'ca', ""n't"", 'control', 'other', 'was', 'hawk', 'school', 'mascot', 'Hugo', 'Odin', 'repeatedly', 'hawk-', 'how', 'hawk', 'soar', 'be', 'independent.The', 'movie', 'excellent', 'job', 'transposing', 'Shakespeare', 'ideas', 'big', 'screen', 'modern', 'language', 'Take', 'example', 'scene', 'Hugo', 'plant', 'seeds', 'doubt', 'Odin', 'mind', 'girlfriend', 'fidelity', 'Here', 'schene', 'place', 'weight', 'room', 'Josh', 'Harnett', 'kind', 'sexy', 'seductive', 'way', 'wonderfully', 'sly', 'manipulative', 'far', 'better', 'job', 'Kenneth', 'Branaugh', 'did', '1995', 'film']",O
683454,AD6G5M3KL7GTB,B00005U8EL,Eric Smith,"[2, 3]","As you probably all know, the movie ""O"" is a modern-day adaptation of Shakespere's ""Othello"" and was held on the shelf two years earlier because of comparisions between the movie and the Columbine shooting. Well, it's been a while and I just rented this movie. Overall it's a fairly good movie, though I had a few bones to pick with it. First off, the beginning scenes seemed a bit ""Choppy"", not flowing together very well. I also think they could've done better in choosing the actor for the character of Hugo. I'm sorry but I think Josh Hartnett is overrated as an actor. No doubt he does have (some) talent, but I just didn't get much of a feeling from his acting...it just seemed quite bland. Julia Stile's acting was good as usual, though she really didn't have much to do in the film. There needed to be more actions regarding race. Everyone seemed to ignore the fact that Odin (O) was the only African-American in the school...which was what caused such controversy in the original Shakesperian play. Another bone I had to pick was background music. Yes they did need to put (some) Hip-Hop in the background but the amount they used was rediculous. This is TWO years ago when Hip-Hop wasn't as mainstream...and at a Southern Prep Boarding School I'm sure they listened to a lot more then Hip Hop. Anyways, I thought the movie got better and more powerful towards the end. I don't mean to be a spoiler, but hey...you'll know ""Othello"" is a tragedy and of course people die in the end. I thought the plot picked up towards the end, and we the audience learned more and more about each character which kept us interested (at first I felt like just turning off the moving it was so boring). In addition there was a lot of imagery...with the doves always enclosed in the circle (of course in an ""O"" shape) with a dark background. I like how there was narration in the beginning and end. Overall I thought the movie was pretty good but I was expecting more then what I got out of it. You'll just have to see it for yourself. At leased it had Julia Stiles who was the best as always!

683458,A2VE83MZF98ITY,B00005U8EL,"FrKurt Messick ""FrKurt Messick""","[6, 6]","Modern directors have found a way of connecting great literature to younger audiences by putting recasting the context -- this is not a corruption, for indeed Shakespeare and other literary giants have had their work adapted for the times, and for different times, on stage and screen numerous times.  Perhaps the best comparison here is the adaptation of the French 'Dangerous Liaisons' to the modern, urban 'Cruel Intentions'.  One of the best places for playing out unbridled passion isn't the corporate boardroom or courtroom or political venue, but the intensely emotional and unrestrained world of teenagers and high school.  It is into this context that director Tim Blake Nelson (also known for his acting in 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' and 'Holes') and screenwriter Brad Kaaya updated Shakespeare's play of jealousy and betrayal, Othello.While Mekhi Phifer is the title player ('O', actually Odin James, the modern Othello), Josh Hartnett in the supporting role of Hugo (Iago) steals the show.  Odin is a black basketball player in a private, mostly-white southern prep school, in love with the dean's daughter, and the star of the basketball team, setting up rivalries in the team based both on abilities and racial lines.  Hugo is jealous of Odin's popularity, skill and preferential treatment by all, even Hugo's own father, Duke Goulding (Martin Sheen), the basketball coach.  Hugo decides to ruin Odin, his jealousy becoming contagious of a sort to influence his roommate Roger, his own girlfriend Emily (Rain Phoenix), Odin's best friend Michael, and finally Odin's girlfriend, the dean's daughter, Desi (Desdimona, played by Julia Stiles).This is an underappreciated gem.  The language is not Shakespearean (so comparisons to the recent diCaprio Romeo + Juliet fail here), but the situations are most assuredly from Shakespeare's story.  The ever-increasing layers of manipulation, as situations seem to grow out of control and each seem to take a life of their own, are dizzying and subtle, strong and astonishing.The direction is slow and steady, as if the very pace of the film shares the slow but deepening growth of Hugo/Iago's dark desires.  The styles of the southern prep school, the soundtrack shifting from urban rap to darkening orchestral backing, and the earnest performances of the actors all combine to make this a stunning piece.  The ending, both the planning by Hugo, manipulating others into his intentions, as well as the actual ending is surprising but understandable.

The setting has been modernized from the Venetian army to the world of basketball at a North Carolina prep school.  When Hugo (Iago) becomes jealous of the accomplishments of Odin (Othello) he devises a trap to bring him down by having his girlfriend, Desi (Desdemona) break up with him.  Hugo weaves an all-too-intricate plan that becomes increasingly complicated as time  passes and stages of the scheme do no progress accordingly.  As this is of course a tragedy, the lives of everyone involved is either ended or horribly altered.The acting is superb on the parts of Julia Stiles (Desi), Mekhi Phifer (Odin) and Josh Hartnett (Iago).  An appearance of Martin Sheen as the basketball coach and father of Hugo was pleasantly surprising.  The experience of this seasoned actor was evident in this production that was otherwise lacking in acting talent.  Sadly, the rest of the cast left something to be desired.  Even with the surprise appearance of Rain Phoenix, the younger sister of River, the supporting cast simply did not pull their weight.Why 4 Stars?:  All things considered, this film is one of the few that is worth seeing in the theatre, though I would recommend a discount matinee as the full-price ticket is a little unwarranted.

The problem with transferring this Shakesperean tragedy onto and into the lives of high schoolers is that it reads (without prior knowledge of the play, which I'm assuming most of the young people whom this appeals to will not have read) as just another examination of misguided teenage violence devoid of a thesis.The cinematography is beautiful in places, and our new Othello (O) and Iago (Hugo) are well casted and well acted, but the excellent Julia Stiles (Desi/Desdemona) has nothing to do but look victimized and flat. (As in a flat character not flat chested). The racial tension is forced upon the viewer a little too forcefully; I think the screenwriter could have found more subtle ways to show us the animosities there.This movie is disturbing and violent.  I would recommend discretion in regards to what ages view this film.  It's an interesting adaption, but (and I apologize if I come across as a purist) because the violence is so explicit,and in the end, pointless, there isn't a larger frame of reference to put this in for most people, no discussion afterwards like the reading of Othello in a classroom might provide, that I'm forced to wonder what was the point of making this film?

Bernabo,"[6, 6]","&quot;O&quot; was originally scheduled to be released right after the Columbine High School shootings and since the film deals with violence and shooting in a high school setting it was pulled and not released for another two years.  But like the episodes of television's &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; that were pulled in the period following the Columbine tragedy, it is impossible to look at this story and see it inspiring a similar crime.  Besides, did Mirimax (the original distributor, ultimately replaced by Lion Gate) ask schools to stop teaching &quot;Othello&quot; or have any of their other releases, which could also be accused of inspiring teenage violence, pulled from video stores?  Somehow, I suspect not.Obviously the film takes Shakespeare's play and updates it by transforming the story to a Southern high school and its star basketball player.  Within that context I think the biggest change in the dynamic of the story is overlooked, because in &quot;O&quot; the big game is still to be played.  In &quot;Othello&quot; the war is over and Venice has been saved by the Moor.  This is a significant difference, because in this case Odin (Mekhi Phifer) has the pressures of sports working in tandem with the machinations of Hugo (Josh Hartnett) to fan O's jealousy towards Desi (Julia Stiles).  I admit I have something of a problem thinking that Odin really cares about any woman more than he does about the game, but it is worked into the complex plot that Hugo is weaving toward the story's fatal climax.There are obvious comparisons to be drawn between &quot;O&quot; and other version of Shakespeare in high school dress, such as &quot;William Shakespeare's Romeo &amp; Juliet&quot; and &quot;10 Things I Hate About You&quot; (also with Stiles).  Actually the film that came to mind first with me was &quot;Cruel Intentions,&quot; another film where the classic plot line seems an absolute natural for being set in a high school, but the performances are justs a bit too stylized at times.  Not that this version does not have its advantages.  Certainly the motivation of Hugo is a lot clearer in &quot;O&quot; than what we find with Iago in Shakespeare, and O's final speech provides a fitting epitaph.  By paying attention to the essence of Shakespeare's plays rather than the time, place, or words (several key moments in the film are carried entire by the significant looks characters give one another), &quot;O&quot; certainly keeps the commercial viability of such projects intact.Ironically, I picked up this DVD along with a copy of Shakespeare's &quot;Othello,&quot; only to discover that Disc 2 has a restored version of the 1922 silent film of &quot;Othello&quot; with Emil Jannings.

With that in mind the filmakers have done a good job adapting it into a realistic present day tradgedy.Odin is the star player of his prep school basketball team, he is popular, dates the girl of his dreams, the coach loves him like a son, and colleges are fighting over him. So what is the problem? The coach has a son, Hugo (sound familiar?) that wants his dad to love him like a son. He does everything his father asks yet Odin was still the MVP. All he wants is a little appreciation. Too bad they didn't give it to him. So angry is Hugo that he unleashes the largest double-cross since Iago double-crossed Othello. It is too good to go on. Lets just say for a while it goes as planned.There are several major hang ups with this film that can't be overlooked. Unfortunatly some of them are plot spoilers so it would be wrong to go into them. However, this film does raise an interesting question about society, especially our youth. How long should we let people go before we ask is everything okay? See the film and you will understand.The acting from the young cast is solid and the film looks great. The all rap soundtrack was a little out of place, but it did serve well in some dramatic moments. The story is very solid, but don't forget, Shakepeare really wrote it. And on an additional note, anyone who is affraid this film is in Shakepearian English can relax, it's not.Problems aside, this film is worth a watch.

683479,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00005U8EL,Matthew Horner,"[2, 2]","You'd think any movie based on a Shakespeare play would have little trouble making it to the screen. Such was not the case with ""O'"", which is based on ""Othello"". Once the small, independent production was finished, prestigious Miramax Films quickly picked it up for distribution. Then came the Columbine shootings, and since ""O"" updates the violent story to a private high school in South Carolina, Miramax got cold feet and shelved the film. They didn't count on the persistence of Tim Blake Nelson, the director, who sued them. Finally, two years later, ""O"" was picked up and released by Lions Gate. All this fuss was about bad timing, not bad moviemaking. We can, of course, argue that movies overall are too violent. What was Nelson supposed to do? Change the ending of a story written four hundred years ago? Shakespeare's plays have either happy or unhappy endings, never ambiguous ones. ""Othello"" is definitely in the unhappy category; it ends the way it ought to.This fictional private high school in Charleston, SC may be small, but it has one great basketball team. The star of the team, Odin [Mekhi Phifer] is the only black student. [Remember that in Shakespeare, Othello was the only black man in Venice.] When the team wins the game that allows them to go to the state championships, Coach Goulding [Martin Sheen] lets the whole student body know that he loves Odin as if he were his own son. This does at all please the troubled Hugo [Josh Hartnett], who is not just another star player. He's Goulding's real son. Enlisting the aid of another student, Roger [Elden Henson], who will do anything to get the approval of the school's winners and leaders, Hugo plots to destroy Odin. He tries several things that don't work before he discovers Odin's fatal flaw - a jealous streak that can be manipulated into rage and fury. When he suggests that their good friend, Michael [Andrew Keegan] may be sleeping with Odin's girlfriend, Desi [Julia Styles], a sinister plot is irreversibly set into motion. As is typical of Shakespeare, though, this plot is not as foolproof as its perpetrator thinks it is.The cast is quite good. Josh Hartnett, often seen in big budget action fare such as ""Black Hawk Down"", gets to display a wide range of emotions. Mekhi Phifer does a wonderful job as Odin. Part of their success can be credited to the director, who is a fine actor himself.The movie's plot follows Shakespeare closely, but it throws out all of his glorious dialog. This, and the choice of what setting to place the modern story in, are both the strongest and weakest points of the movie, depending on the point of view. It's strong because it presents the story in an accessible way to teenagers. It preserves Shakespeare's astute observations about the cataclysmic results that some emotions [in this case, jealousy] can induce. It shows that violence only begets more violence. The weaknesses, though, almost outweigh the strengths. It's true that the same character flaws that undo a great prince and warrior can also destroy a basketball player, but reducing the grandeur and stature of the characters also reduces the impact of the story. Hugo uses his words to propel Odin into action, just as Iago uses them on Othello. In Shakespeare's version, Iago's words are so powerful that we readily understand Othello's reactions to them. Odin's being so swayed by Hugo's modern lingo makes him seem rather gullible. As a result, that shocking ending loses much of its emotional impact.",3,Interesting Attempt at an Update of Othello,1015632000,"03 9, 2002",2002,3495,"[""'d"", 'think', 'movie', 'based', 'Shakespeare', 'play', 'would', 'have', 'little', 'trouble', 'making', 'screen', 'Such', 'was', 'not', 'case', 'O', 'based', 'Othello', 'small', 'independent', 'production', 'was', 'finished', 'prestigious', 'Miramax', 'Films', 'quickly', 'picked', 'up', 'distribution', 'Then', 'came', 'Columbine', 'shootings', 'O', 'violent', 'story', 'private', 'high', 'school', 'South', 'Carolina', 'Miramax', 'got', 'cold', 'feet', 'shelved', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'count', 'persistence', 'Tim', 'Blake', 'Nelson', 'director', 'who', 'sued', 'Finally', 'two', 'years', 'later', 'O', 'was', 'picked', 'up', 'released', 'Lions', 'Gate', 'fuss', 'was', 'bad', 'timing', 'not', 'bad', 'moviemaking', 'can', 'course', 'argue', 'movies', 'overall', 'are', 'too', 'violent', 'What', 'was', 'Nelson', 'supposed', 'do', 'Change', 'ending', 'story', 'written', 'four', 'hundred', 'years', 'ago', 'Shakespeare', 'plays', 'have', 'happy', 'unhappy', 'endings', 'never', 'ambiguous', 'ones', 'Othello', 'definitely', 'unhappy', 'category', 'way', 'ought', 'to.This', 'fictional', 'private', 'high', 'school', 'Charleston', 'SC', 'may', 'be', 'small', 'one', 'great', 'basketball', 'team', 'star', 'team', 'Odin', '[', 'Mekhi', 'Phifer', ']', 'only', 'black', 'student', '[', 'Remember', 'Shakespeare', 'Othello', 'was', 'only', 'black', 'man', 'Venice', ']', 'When', 'team', 'game', 'go', 'state', 'championships', 'Coach', 'Goulding', '[', 'Martin', 'Sheen', ']', 'whole', 'student', 'body', 'know', 'were', 'own', 'son', 'please', 'troubled', 'Hugo', '[', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', ']', 'who', 'not', 'just', 'star', 'player', 'Goulding', 'real', 'son', 'Enlisting', 'aid', 'student', 'Roger', '[', 'Elden', 'Henson', ']', 'who', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'get', 'approval', 'school', 'winners', 'leaders', 'Hugo', 'plots', 'destroy', 'Odin', 'several', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'Odin', 'fatal', 'flaw', 'jealous', 'streak', 'can', 'be', 'manipulated', 'rage', 'fury', 'When', 'good', 'friend', 'Michael', '[', 'Andrew', 'Keegan', ']', 'may', 'be', 'sleeping', 'Odin', 'girlfriend', 'Desi', '[', 'Julia', 'Styles', ']', 'sinister', 'plot', 'irreversibly', 'set', 'motion', 'typical', 'Shakespeare', 'though', 'plot', 'not', 'as', 'foolproof', 'perpetrator', 'is.The', 'cast', 'quite', 'good', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'often', 'seen', 'big', 'budget', 'action', 'fare', 'such', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'display', 'wide', 'range', 'emotions', 'Mekhi', 'Phifer', 'wonderful', 'job', 'Odin', 'Part', 'success', 'can', 'be', 'credited', 'director', 'who', 'fine', 'actor', 'himself.The', 'movie', 'plot', 'Shakespeare', 'closely', 'out', 'glorious', 'dialog', 'choice', 'what', 'setting', 'place', 'modern', 'story', 'are', 'strongest', 'weakest', 'points', 'movie', 'depending', 'point', 'view', 'strong', 'story', 'accessible', 'way', 'teenagers', 'Shakespeare', 'astute', 'observations', 'cataclysmic', 'results', 'emotions', '[', 'case', 'jealousy', ']', 'can', 'induce', 'violence', 'only', 'more', 'violence', 'weaknesses', 'though', 'almost', 'outweigh', 'strengths', 'true', 'same', 'character', 'flaws', 'undo', 'great', 'prince', 'warrior', 'can', 'also', 'destroy', 'basketball', 'player', 'reducing', 'grandeur', 'stature', 'characters', 'also', 'impact', 'story', 'Hugo', 'words', 'propel', 'Odin', 'action', 'just', 'Iago', 'Othello', 'Shakespeare', 'version', 'Iago', 'words', 'are', 'so', 'powerful', 'readily', 'understand', 'Othello', 'reactions', 'Odin', 'being', 'so', 'swayed', 'Hugo', 'modern', 'lingo', 'seem', 'rather', 'gullible', 'result', 'shocking', 'ending', 'loses', 'much', 'emotional', 'impact']",O

I was hoping and expecting for another 10 Things I Hate About You - and was pleasantly surprised when I watched it, and discovered that it's rawer, sexier and more violent than 10 Things I Hate About You.Mekhi Phifer (8 Mile) stars as the originally nicknamed ""O"" and is the only black guy in a private school (which reminded me of Cruel Intentions), who is the star basketball player. He is going out with Julia Stiles, Desi, and his best friends are Andrew Keegan, and Josh Hartnett. Things start to go wrong when Hugo's (Josh) father (the head of the school) publicly announces that he sees Odin as a son to him - thus upsetting his own son. Jealous of O, and making a promise to his best friend, Hugo starts to sow the seeds of doubt when it comes to O and Desi, setting off a chain of events, which end tragically.There are some very strong performances from all the actors in this, and the film also deals with the drugs, which O also ends up involved in, showing his downward spiral, after falling out with Desi. Previously, it was only Hugo that took drugs - including a scene that will make you wince when he gets injected into a vein into his stomach.If you think you recognise some of the supporting actors, then you'd be right. Rain Phoenix shows she can act as well as her brother, although she's a very underrated actor in this.  Elden Henson previously starred in She's All That, and Andrew Keegan starred in 10 Things I Hate About You, so in O, he is reunited with his ""enemy"" in that, Julia Stiles.I won't ruin the ending for anyone, but it's very dramatic, and has undertones of Romeo & Juliet at the same time. It's also a very surprising ending, as everyone's lives completely unravel, and I was left with tears in my eyes at the end.The extras are quite good. You get a few trailers for other Lions Gate Films (none of which look very interesting); cast & crew interviews (consisting of Julia Stiles, Mekhi Phifer, Josh Hartnett, and the director, Tim Blake Nelson); deleted scenes; and comprehensive analysis of key basketball scenes (very boring, and also the sound mix is dreadful, and you can barely hear the guys making the commentary). Also, which is quite surprising, you get the newly restored classic film ""Othello"" (from 1922, so I won't be watching THAT anytime soon)There's an underlying message in this movie - everyone has their flaws, and they can either make them great, or lead to their downfall.A great movie if you're a fan of Julia Stiles, any of the modern day versions of Shakespeare's film, or if you're just looking for a great teen movie, with an outstanding cast. Just watch the sound - whether it was my DVD player, or the guys just can't speak above a whisper, I was having big problems with the sound, and ended up getting deafened when the basketball scenes came on.",4,A great adaptation,1077667200,"02 25, 2004",2004,2897,"[""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'O', 'previously', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'anywhere', 'buy', 'DVD', 'was', 'hoping', 'expecting', '10', 'Things', 'Hate', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'when', 'watched', 'discovered', 'rawer', 'sexier', 'more', 'violent', '10', 'Things', 'Hate', 'You.Mekhi', 'Phifer', '8', 'Mile', 'originally', 'nicknamed', 'O', 'only', 'black', 'guy', 'private', 'school', 'reminded', 'Cruel', 'Intentions', 'who', 'star', 'basketball', 'player', 'going', 'out', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'Desi', 'best', 'friends', 'are', 'Andrew', 'Keegan', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'Things', 'start', 'go', 'wrong', 'when', 'Hugo', 'Josh', 'father', 'head', 'school', 'publicly', 'Odin', 'son', 'thus', 'upsetting', 'own', 'son', 'Jealous', 'O', 'making', 'promise', 'best', 'friend', 'Hugo', 'sow', 'seeds', 'doubt', 'when', 'O', 'Desi', 'setting', 'off', 'chain', 'events', 'end', 'are', 'very', 'strong', 'performances', 'actors', 'film', 'also', 'drugs', 'O', 'also', 'up', 'involved', 'showing', 'downward', 'spiral', 'falling', 'out', 'Desi', 'Previously', 'was', 'only', 'Hugo', 'took', 'drugs', 'including', 'scene', 'will', 'make', 'wince', 'when', 'injected', 'vein', 'stomach.If', 'think', 'recognise', 'supporting', 'actors', 'then', ""'d"", 'be', 'right', 'Rain', 'Phoenix', 'can', 'act', 'as', 'well', 'brother', 'very', 'underrated', 'actor', 'Elden', 'Henson', 'previously', 'starred', 'Andrew', 'Keegan', 'starred', '10', 'Things', 'Hate', 'so', 'O', 'reunited', 'enemy', 'Julia', 'Stiles.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'ending', 'anyone', 'very', 'dramatic', 'undertones', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'same', 'time', 'also', 'very', 'surprising', 'ending', 'everyone', 'lives', 'completely', 'unravel', 'was', 'left', 'tears', 'eyes', 'end.The', 'extras', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'get', 'few', 'trailers', 'other', 'Lions', 'Gate', 'Films', 'none', 'look', 'very', 'interesting', 'cast', 'crew', 'interviews', 'consisting', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'Mekhi', 'Phifer', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'director', 'Tim', 'Blake', 'Nelson', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'comprehensive', 'analysis', 'key', 'basketball', 'scenes', 'very', 'boring', 'also', 'sound', 'mix', 'dreadful', 'can', 'barely', 'hear', 'guys', 'making', 'commentary', 'Also', 'quite', 'surprising', 'get', 'newly', 'restored', 'classic', 'film', 'Othello', '1922', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'watching', 'anytime', 'soon', 'underlying', 'message', 'movie', 'everyone', 'flaws', 'can', 'either', 'make', 'great', 'lead', 'downfall.A', 'great', 'movie', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'modern', 'day', 'versions', 'Shakespeare', 'film', ""'re"", 'just', 'looking', 'great', 'teen', 'movie', 'outstanding', 'cast', 'Just', 'watch', 'sound', 'was', 'DVD', 'player', 'guys', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'whisper', 'was', 'having', 'big', 'problems', 'sound', 'ended', 'up', 'getting', 'deafened', 'when', 'basketball', 'scenes', 'came']",O

I mean: an adaptation of the Shakespeare play Othello that includes a basketball team?  How was that going to work?  It works perfectly!  This tale of a man, who seems to have it all, betrayed by his friend's jealousy is adapted into a boarding school setting.  Mekhi Phifer is Odin, the tragic hero.  Odin is the star of the boarding school's basketball team, dating the teams daughter, popular and loved by all.  The basketball team's coach, played by Martin Sheen, has told Odin that he is like a son to him, much to the chagrin of his real son, Hugo (played by Josh Hartnett).  Hugo is insanely jealous of Odin, especially Odin's relationship with Hugo's father.  Hugo wants to be the center of attention.  He hatches a plan to bring Odin down, deceptively drawing everyone into his web of deceipt.  He enlists his roommate as an assistant to his plot, promising Odin's girlfrined Desi (played by Julia Stiles) as the reward for a job well done.Jealousy, rage, betrayal - this movie has all of the original elements of Shakespeare's Othello.  The actors are brilliant in their roles.  Julia Stiles has once again turned in a great performance in another Shakespeare adaptation (her first being 10 Things I Hate About You aka: Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew).  Josh Hartnett is chilling in his portrayal of Hugo.  The movie is a bit violent, but most of Shakespeare's tragedies involve violence, so this is not surprising.

683482,AUFK6UT2DU87H,B00005U8EL,"Meredith L. Burton ""Bookworm""","[2, 2]","Shakespeare's ""Othello"" has undergone many adaptions.  Perhaps this fact is due to the timelessness of the themes which transcend all centuries; jealousy, deception, and betrayal.  Shakespeare had a knack for exploring relevant themes.  ""O"" is a modern-day adaptation of the best of The Bard's plays.Set in a private school, ""O"" revolves around the school's basketball team.  Odin is the star player, much to the anger of the coach's son, manipulative and unscrupulous Hugo.  The story also focuses on Odin's love for Desi, the Dean's daughter.  Hugo will use his supposed friendship with Odin to plant seeds of doubt regarding Dessi's fidelity.This movie is unforgettable.  It is very disturbing when one realizes how young the characters are supposed to be, which proves that no matter what the age, young individuals have to wrestle with their baser instincts just like everyone else.All of the performers are exceptional.  Mekhi Phifer is unsurpassable as Odin, showing his pain and anger in a totally sympathetic manner.  Julia Stiles is not the best performer in this movie, but she does fairly well as Dessi.  Rain Phoenix, (I hope this is the right actress!) is wonderful as Emily, Hugo's girlfriend and ultimately his tool.  She, like Emilia in the original ""Othello,"" is very smart and realizes what is going on.  Josh Hartnett is wonderful as Hugo, and even shows a human vulnerability to an otherwise despicable and irredeemable character.  His ""love"" sceen with Emily is very frightening as he exhibits his ultimate control.This adaptation provides a commentary on the absence of adults in these teenagers' lives.  For instance, Hugo acts the way he does in order to receive attention, which he does not receive from his aloof father.This movie will remain with you after the final credits have disappeared.  I was thoroughly impressed with how closely the director stayed with the original play.  Even snatches of Shakespeare's dialog is reworked into modern language without robbing them of their original meanings: ""Iago: How poor are they that have no patience. What wound did ever heal but by degrees? Hugo: Why is it you rich kids don't have any patience?  Good plans take time to work"" (Hugo's lines are slightly paraphrased because of some profanity).I would recommend watching this movie in conjunction with the reading of the original play.  Also try the modern adaptation by Andrew Davies, starring Emmann Walker and Christopher Eckleston.  This British adaption, although taking many liberties with the plot of the original play, nevertheless examines the universal themes in an unforgettable manner.",5,A Disturbing Portrait of Deception and Jealousy Among Teenagers,1206921600,"03 31, 2008",2008,2625,"['Shakespeare', 'Othello', 'undergone', 'many', 'adaptions', 'Perhaps', 'fact', 'due', 'timelessness', 'themes', 'transcend', 'centuries', 'jealousy', 'deception', 'betrayal', 'Shakespeare', 'had', 'knack', 'exploring', 'relevant', 'themes', 'O', 'modern-day', 'adaptation', 'best', 'Bard', 'plays.Set', 'private', 'school', 'O', 'school', 'basketball', 'team', 'Odin', 'star', 'player', 'much', 'anger', 'coach', 'son', 'manipulative', 'unscrupulous', 'Hugo', 'story', 'also', 'Odin', 'love', 'Desi', 'Dean', 'daughter', 'Hugo', 'will', 'use', 'supposed', 'friendship', 'Odin', 'plant', 'seeds', 'doubt', 'regarding', 'Dessi', 'fidelity.This', 'movie', 'unforgettable', 'very', 'disturbing', 'when', 'one', 'how', 'young', 'characters', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'matter', 'what', 'age', 'young', 'individuals', 'have', 'wrestle', 'baser', 'just', 'everyone', 'else.All', 'performers', 'are', 'exceptional', 'Mekhi', 'Phifer', 'unsurpassable', 'Odin', 'showing', 'pain', 'anger', 'totally', 'sympathetic', 'manner', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'not', 'best', 'performer', 'movie', 'fairly', 'well', 'Dessi', 'Rain', 'Phoenix', 'hope', 'right', 'actress', 'wonderful', 'Emily', 'Hugo', 'girlfriend', 'ultimately', 'tool', 'Emilia', 'original', 'Othello', 'very', 'smart', 'realizes', 'what', 'going', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'wonderful', 'Hugo', 'even', 'human', 'vulnerability', 'otherwise', 'despicable', 'irredeemable', 'character', 'love', 'sceen', 'Emily', 'very', 'frightening', 'ultimate', 'control.This', 'adaptation', 'commentary', 'absence', 'adults', 'teenagers', 'lives', 'instance', 'Hugo', 'way', 'order', 'receive', 'attention', 'not', 'receive', 'aloof', 'father.This', 'movie', 'will', 'remain', 'final', 'credits', 'have', 'disappeared', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'impressed', 'how', 'closely', 'director', 'stayed', 'original', 'play', 'Even', 'snatches', 'Shakespeare', 'dialog', 'reworked', 'modern', 'language', 'robbing', 'original', 'meanings', 'How', 'poor', 'are', 'have', 'patience', 'What', 'wound', 'did', 'ever', 'heal', 'degrees', 'Hugo', 'Why', 'rich', 'kids', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'patience', 'Good', 'plans', 'take', 'time', 'work', 'Hugo', 'lines', 'are', 'slightly', 'paraphrased', 'profanity', 'would', 'recommend', 'watching', 'movie', 'conjunction', 'reading', 'original', 'play', 'Also', 'try', 'modern', 'adaptation', 'Andrew', 'Davies', 'starring', 'Emmann', 'Walker', 'Christopher', 'Eckleston', 'British', 'adaption', 'taking', 'many', 'liberties', 'plot', 'original', 'play', 'nevertheless', 'universal', 'themes', 'unforgettable', 'manner']",O

The movie is about a young high school student (Josh Hartnett) who is jealous of his basketball teamate (Mekiah Phiper.) His teamate, nicknamed O (short for Odin) is the star backetball player and Josh Hartnett's character wishes that he could get as much attention as Odin gets. So he decides to ruin his life. He decides to befriend Odin, and then lie to him. He makes Odin believe that his girlfriend (Julia Stiles) is cheating on him.This movie is going to have to go down as one of my all time favorites. Unlike in Romeo and Juliet (a terribly done Shakespeare play to modern day movie) Othello (O) is done very well and deserves alot of credit. The acting, especially Mekiah Phipers preformance was absolutley amazing. The only preformance I thought was weak (and the only part of the movie I thought was weak) was Josh Hartnetts preformance. I dont know I just felt it to be mediocre, and I thought he couldve acted like he was more into ruining O's life. Even with Hartnett's weak performance I must admit the directing was well done. One thing I really liked is the transiton of making this a William Shakespere play in the Elizabethan Age to an excellent modern day movie.Although Hartnett's performance was weak I still think this is one of the best movies on DVD and is definitly worth a buy.",5,Amazing,1067817600,"11 3, 2003",2003,1396,"['O', 'modern', 'day', 'remake', 'William', 'Shakespeares', 'Othello', 'great', 'play', 'own', 'right', 'movie', 'young', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'who', 'jealous', 'basketball', 'teamate', 'Mekiah', 'Phiper', 'teamate', 'nicknamed', 'O', 'short', 'Odin', 'star', 'backetball', 'player', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'character', 'could', 'get', 'as', 'much', 'attention', 'Odin', 'ruin', 'life', 'befriend', 'Odin', 'then', 'lie', 'Odin', 'believe', 'girlfriend', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'cheating', 'him.This', 'movie', 'going', 'have', 'go', 'down', 'as', 'one', 'time', 'favorites', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'terribly', 'done', 'Shakespeare', 'play', 'modern', 'day', 'movie', 'Othello', 'O', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'alot', 'credit', 'acting', 'especially', 'Mekiah', 'Phipers', 'preformance', 'was', 'absolutley', 'amazing', 'only', 'preformance', 'thought', 'was', 'weak', 'only', 'part', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'weak', 'was', 'Josh', 'Hartnetts', 'preformance', 'dont', 'know', 'just', 'felt', 'be', 'mediocre', 'thought', 'couldve', 'acted', 'was', 'more', 'ruining', 'O', 'life', 'Even', 'Hartnett', 'weak', 'performance', 'must', 'admit', 'directing', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'One', 'thing', 'really', 'liked', 'transiton', 'making', 'William', 'Shakespere', 'play', 'Elizabethan', 'Age', 'excellent', 'modern', 'day', 'Hartnett', 'performance', 'was', 'weak', 'still', 'think', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'DVD', 'definitly', 'worth', 'buy']",O

If you never read Othello in lit class or on your own, you'll probably like to know that it was one of Shakespeare's more popular tragedies.  In other words, if you're into happy-endings, you WON'T find one here.As far as updates go, this one is actually VERY true to Shakespeare's original (character names, plot lines, plot devices, etc) as opposed to comparable films (like Romeo and Juliet with Titanic boy several years back...).  Points to the producers for staying true to the original.Basically, the overall story is about a jealous, psychotic plot of mind games.  Bitter about being passed over for an MVP award and being overshadowed by the team's Black MVP Odin (Mekhi Phifer), White basketball player Hugo (who is also the coach's son, played by Josh Hartnett), sets in motion a sinister plot of mind games to bring down Odin using friends and lover, Desi (Julia ""Ten Things I Hate About You"", ""Save the Last Dance"" Stiles) as pawns.  In all, the story is pretty decent, although the actions of Hugo can be kindly labeled as ""disturbing.""Beautifully filmed, with a solid hip-hop, basketball, prep-school theme and with a semi-solid story (although some of the plot is a little non-sensical, all this over an MVP award and being upstaged???) the good points about the movie end here.  It's the politically incorrect, highly disturbing ending which really mars this film.  Clearly not for ""impressionable"" kids, this movie does feature prominently the sick mind games of Hugo's character, drug use, an intense sex scene (which is cool with me...) guns and TONS of graphic violence at the end. The films completely tragic ending will leave most with a REALLY bad taste in their mouths.  Despite it's delayed release (completed in 1998, the release was IN FACT delayed because of the school shootings of recent years) it is amazing in the wake of Columbine and other school shootings that this film EVER saw the light of day.It's actually a pretty powerful film, in fact a true piece of art for filmography.  The images at the end will just leave you shocked (like a good tragedy should).  However, if you're like myself, you'll more than likely will NOT like this film as, I repeat, the ending leaves a REALLY bad taste in your mouth.  If you are into sinister mind games, psychopaths, and senseless violence, by all means, THIS IS YOUR MOVIE.

683487,A2SETXU4UY67C9,B00005U8EL,"Ms Diva ""cycworker""","[5, 8]","What do you get when you take a brilliant seventeenth century Shakespearian tragedy about a general who driven to a murderous rage by a deceitful underling into believing his new spouse is unfaithful and set it in a private high school in the twenty first century? A very unconvincing, well meaning, but ultimately average movie. I am speaking, of course, about Lions Gate Cinema's O, directed by Tim Blake Nelson.The Shakespeare play is, of course, Othello, and the plot is basically as simple as outlined above. But Shakespeare had a way of bringing out all the drama, pathos, and motivation of his characters and their situation. We could understand what made it possible for Iago (Hugo in the movie) to want to destroy Othello (Odin, or ""O""). We understand how Othello could be driven to murder because of his fear that Desdimona  (Desi) is being unfaithful to him with Cassio (Michael Cassio) in the movie. It never quite comes together in the movie.The reason it doesn't work in the movie is simple: the translation doesn't work. The fact is that a hot shot basketball star is in no way shape or form comparable to a man who is a general in the battlefield. This is high school, and O and Desi have only been dating for four months.  A huge issue in the original play is that Othello is black. Shakespeare really tackles the issue of racism; it's part of Iago's motive. This movie totally glosses over the interracial aspect of the relationship. O seems totally unaware of the fact that he's the only black man on the campus. Everyone likes and accepts him. Hugo's  (played by Josh Hartnett, who may as well have been wearing a curled black mustache) problems with him is the fact that his father (played by Martin Sheen, doing his imitation of Bobby Knight on speed) loves O like a son, and O views Michael, not him, as his right hand man (naming him co-MVP at the end of the season). It also does short shrift to issues of bullying, drug abuse and intense competition in the basketball world. If the movie focused more on these issues it might have worked. Instead, it focused on the romantic entanglements of a group of callow, two dimensional teenagers I didn't much care about.I thought some of the performances were excellent, if wasted. Mekhi Phifer and Julia Stiles are revelations.  They look to have long futures ahead of them. In fact, it is in part the fact that Phifer and Stiles made their characters seem so intelligent that the movie was so hard to swallow. I just couldn't buy that Odin would fall for Hugo's lies. How does a black guy who has had to bust his hump to get where he is, who must have seen and experienced some racism at some point, not get even slightly suspicious of a white guy who starts slamming his girlfriend and messing with his head just before the state championships? And, I'm sorry, as I said above, O and Desi were dating all of four months. If she's cheating on ya, just break up with her man!  I admired how Stiles tried to make Desi modern and intelligent But, she was really hampered by the plot (which is actually typical of Shakespeare plays - women are really important). She can see this guy getting weirded out, she calls him on it, and yet she doesn't just dump his sorry butt. It was ridiculous. The supporting players were great, as well. I totally bought it that Emily (the talented Rain Phoenix), Micheal (a surprisingly effective Andrew Keegan) and Rodger (a heartbreaking fantastic Elden Henson)The best part of the movie was actually the basketball scenes.

Odin James (Mekhi Phifer), the school's star basketball player, spends most of his time in the limelight, and the time he's not he spends in a secret relationship with Desi Brable (Julia Stiles). Odin's best friend, Hugo Goulding (Josh Hartnett), who also happens to be the coach's (Martin Sheen) son, is tired of seeing Odin in the spotlight all the time-- and, of course, also wants to be the guy dating the school's resident goddess. Thus, in true Shakespearean fashion, he contrives an impossibly complex plot to make Odin think Desi's scoring on the side while Odin's off scoring baskets. And, in true Shakespearean fashion, everything that can go wrong does. This is a tragedy. You know that things will not end well.Now, given the updated setting and abbreviated running time, you know that this isn't Baranagh or Olivier, and O shouldn't necessarily be compared to Olivier (or, for that matter, Welles, who got a tan to play the title role a dozen years before Olivier did). And taken on its own merits, this is a pretty good stand-alone flick. Phifer is on fire in the title role. Hartnett could have probably been a bit more consistent, but when it comes to the climax, he rises to the occasion. Stiles is the weak link in this triangle; she's upstaged by Rain Phoenix, who plays her roommate, in every scene the two share.

683498,A1P9QCU33WQQED,B00005U8EL,Sandra Robertson,"[2, 2]","I just watched this yesterday, and after reading some of the online reviews, I couldn't help but wonder if I saw the same film.  I'm probably the biggest Shakespeare fan I know, and I think this film updates Old Willy's story admirably, even going him one better, IMHO.  One problem I always had with Othello is that I never could figure why Iago feels he has to go to such lengths to destroy everyone; in ""O"" Hugo's jealously for his father's attention, coupled with his 'roid rage, make his motivations believable. However, I think you really should be somewhat familiar with Shakepeare's work to truly get the most out of this film.The film is beautifully photographed and the brooding intensity of the main character is reflected in the murky sensuality of the foggy, Spanish moss-hung Charleston campus.There are some very good performances, and the film doesn't try to soften what remains, after FIVE HUNDRED YEARS, a very powerful storyline. Mekhi Phifer is very good, Josh Hartnett is excellent, and Rain Phoenix gives a very strong performance.  I thought Julia Stiles was the weak link in this ensemble, however.  Though physically right for the role, (Desi should be the preppiest, whitest girl on campus, and Stiles is a fresh-scrubbed teen-model beauty) Stiles' performance irritated me, coming off as more than a little wooden.  For reasons I can't fathom, she played one entire scene (a two-shot with Phifer) looking just over his shoulder rather than at him.  Did she have cue cards over there, or what?Note to parents and teachers: This film has graphic depictions of psychosexual violence that disturbed me greatly.  One earlier reviewer is a teacher who showed this to her AP English class; if I did that, I would be fired.

It's been years since I've read the play, but the silent movie included on disc 2 helped jog my memory some. Comparing the two, it was interesting how closely _""O""_ follows _Othello_.This is not like _Romeo + Juliet_ where the play was acted out within a modern setting. _""O""_ is a true update - including the language. You have a basketball player instead of a warrior out on the battlefield, a basketball coach named Duke instead of an actual duke, and so on. All of the elements are there even if there are slight changes to names. There may also be some changes with the ending. (I have not reread the play recently.) All of it has wonderful acting and production style. Some of the less major characters are not performed as well as the main ones, but they aren't too bad. Very powerful ending!!The first DVD has the movie in both letterboxed and pan/scan. The DVD box incorrectly mentions the trailer being on disc 1. All of the extras are on disc 2.The second DVD includes the trailer, interviews, deleted scenes and a silent film version of _Othello_.The movie _Othello_ is a nice production of the play, and from what I can remember, it seems to follow the play very well. It appears to have been made on an average budget. The sets look like stage sets - which wasn't too unusual for silent movies. The silent film runs about 80 minutes. However, about 66 minutes into the movie, it appears some frames are missing. It doesn't seem to cause too much trouble in following the plot.The DVD of _""O""_ is a great value considering you're actually getting two movies.

683502,A2CCMDEZSWKMGQ,B00005U8EL,The Judge of the Value of all Entertainment & Art,"[5, 17]","Kids love abbreviations. That's probably why the masterminds behind the teen movie extravaganza based on Shakespeare's ""Othello"" decided to rename it ""O."" Why try to keep a young audience interested for those five extra letters, whatever their symbolic value might be. Symbolism? That is so four centuries ago!If the improvements over Shakespeare's work had stopped there, though, one might wonder what the point of creating this film might be. Fortunately, the overhaul is exhaustive. For one thing, Othello, who is now named Odin without explanation, no longer fights in an army, but plays on a basketball team. After all, are athletes not our modern gladiators? GENIUS! Also, the scribes behind this screen adaptation took note of the fact that very few modern youths would become engaged at the ripe young age of 17, at which Desi (Desdemona's new moniker) and Odin (Othello's name... for whatever reason) are currently residing. As such, Odin states that he doesn't ""want to run off to Vegas or nothing(sic),"" but that maybe they can ""pretend for awhile,"" as he slips a rubber band onto his love's ring finger. Few could argue that screenwriter Brad Kaaya has anything less than a subtle, genius handle on translating this timeless tale... for our times.Sit down. Breathe deeply. There's little doubt that your heart is practically beating out of your chest with excitement over these downright incredible advancements over Shakespeare's ""first draft"" of ""O,"" but you haven't heard the best of them yet, and it would be a shame for you to drop dead from gleeful shock before even having the chance to view this masterpiece. As such, let us fearlessly move on to how Kaaya dealt with ""the Michael Cassio Problem.""It hardly needs explanation, but in case you're simply clueless, allow me to reveal exactly what this conundrum constitutes: you see, my dear reader, it's common knowledge that the modern American teenager couldn't possibly care less about his or her reputation. Popularity is a secondary concern. Nothing shames them. They don't spend hours worrying about what others think of them. This is a thing of the past. Alas, though, Michael Cassio, an important character in ""Othello,"" does worry very much about his reputation... fortunately, this script is in the hands of pros, and they serve up a solution that is more than plausible, and in fact speaks volumes about the generation gap. ""Dude,"" worries Michael to Hugo (Iago), ""My parents are going to kill me... they're always talking about reputation."" Of course! He's worried about what his parents think. I wish I'd thought of that. Hugo, then, tells him to ""play by [his] own rules,"" and not worry what his parents think. I'm sure that's an improvement over whatever Iago might have said in the original play.Anyone with a head on his or her shoulders would prefer this film version of ""Othello"" to the script cranked out by Shakespeare. It's more visually stimulating, has a younger cast, is shorter, and avoids Shakespeare's fancypants showoffy writing in favor of good old  plain English.

Anyway ""O"" has the makings of a remarkable film:  great acting, great plot, original cinematography, and some pretty good music.  For the running time of this film, I temporarily forgot that it's a modernized adaptation of Shakespeare's Othello.  Mekhi Pfifer can count this as a milestone and breakthrough film of his career.  This is Shakespeare at its finest and Mekhi carries the movie brilliantly as 'O' (the modernized Othello).  The characters are layered and, unlike many of the films that were released betwenn 2000 and 2001, you're able to understand why things happened the way they did.  You understand why Iago (Hugo - played brilliantly by Josh Hartnett) is jealous of 'O'.  Think about it.  The coach (Hugo's father) seems to favor 'O' more than his very own son.  Julia Styles is both wonderful and beautiful as Desi (an updated Desdemona).  I understand the controversy that surrounded this film.
