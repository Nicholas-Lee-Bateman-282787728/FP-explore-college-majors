I thought I was just too uncoordinated.  I decided, though, to give this DVD a try based on favorable reviews.Finally!  Scott Cole is the total package.  He is very easy on the eyes (for us women), has a soft, pleasant voice, a very appealing manner and, best of all, he has created an easy to follow and enjoyable workout for me.  I have only done the PM Workout so far as relaxing is my main goal.  He starts going very slowly through all the moves and explains them thoroughly.  I don't pay attention to right or left, I just watch him and mirror him and I was not confused.  Once he gets you familiar with the workout, he puts it all together in a beautiful beach setting, flowing through all the moves with narration and then repeating the moves for a second time with just music.  A lot of moves emphasized getting joints looser and there were balancing moves - I was shaky on these but this practice should improve my balance and that is one of the purposes of tai chi.  Also, I could feel afterward that my leg muscles had been working.  I think everyone could do the PM Workout and Scott says at times to not judge yourself if you can't do everything precisely.I previewed the AM Workout and the music and moves are faster and more energetic but either workout can be done at any time of day.  I look forward to giving that one a try but, even if I only use the PM Workout, it is well worth the money for me.",5,Scott Cole Rocks!,1266710400,"02 21, 2010",2010,1529,"['am', 'total', 'beginner', 'tai', 'chi', 'had', 'tried', 'few', 'tapes', 'years', 'ago', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'heads', 'tails', 'thought', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'uncoordinated', 'decided', 'though', 'give', 'DVD', 'try', 'based', 'favorable', 'reviews.Finally', 'Scott', 'Cole', 'total', 'package', 'very', 'easy', 'eyes', 'women', 'soft', 'pleasant', 'voice', 'very', 'appealing', 'manner', 'best', 'created', 'easy', 'follow', 'enjoyable', 'workout', 'have', 'only', 'done', 'PM', 'Workout', 'so', 'far', 'relaxing', 'main', 'goal', 'going', 'very', 'slowly', 'moves', 'thoroughly', 'do', ""n't"", 'pay', 'attention', 'right', 'left', 'just', 'watch', 'mirror', 'was', 'not', 'confused', 'Once', 'familiar', 'workout', 'together', 'beautiful', 'beach', 'setting', 'flowing', 'moves', 'narration', 'then', 'repeating', 'moves', 'second', 'time', 'just', 'music', 'lot', 'moves', 'emphasized', 'getting', 'joints', 'looser', 'were', 'balancing', 'moves', 'was', 'shaky', 'practice', 'should', 'improve', 'balance', 'one', 'purposes', 'tai', 'chi', 'Also', 'could', 'feel', 'afterward', 'leg', 'muscles', 'had', 'been', 'working', 'think', 'everyone', 'could', 'do', 'PM', 'Workout', 'Scott', 'times', 'not', 'judge', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'everything', 'precisely.I', 'previewed', 'AM', 'Workout', 'music', 'moves', 'are', 'faster', 'more', 'energetic', 'workout', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'time', 'day', 'look', 'forward', 'giving', 'one', 'try', 'even', 'only', 'use', 'PM', 'Workout', 'well', 'money']",Scott Cole: Discover Tai Chi AM/PM Workouts

1225213,A2QX49LS3Y3ANI,B001OSC4F6,Dienne,"[14, 14]","I'll admit upfront that I don't know much about Tai Chi, so I can't say whether Scott Cole teaches ""authentic"" Tai Chi in this video.  But I can say, I really like it.I haven't done the AM workout very much.  I prefer a more vigorous workout early in the morning, which this Tai Chi video is not, so I've only done it a couple times on weekends when I can get to the Y later in the morning for a ""real"" workout.  Because I've only done it a few times, I haven't got all the movements yet and I can't do the entire flow sequence without instructions.But I absolutely LOVE the PM workout.  I do it almost every night before I go to bed to relax after a day of work and kids.  It leaves me feeling so peaceful and relaxed that I can go right to bed and fall deeply asleep - something that hasn't been easy for me lately.In each segment, Scott starts with a verbal introduction to Tai Chi (which I now forward through), and then talks you through each move individually while demonstrating and giving you plenty of time to practice.  His explanations and demonstrations make it very easy to follow along.  Then he does the entire flow sequence giving just the name and perhaps a brief explanation of each movement, and finally he does the entire flow sequence without any words.  The explanation portion of each segment is filmed in a studio, while the two flow portions of each segment are filmed on a beach.  In the studio, the camera angles are very good for following along in mirror pose.  Once on the beach, however, Scott is filmed from a variety of angles, so if you haven't mastered the sequence from the explanation portion, you might have difficulty following along.I find Scott Cole to be a great instructor.  He's very encouraging and non-judgmental.  His voice is gentle, soothing and easy to listen to and he himself is easy to look at, if you know what I mean.If you're looking to shape up or lose weight, this video probably won't do much for you.  But if you're looking to de-stress as well as to develop more control, both mentally and physically, as well as other health benefits of Tai Chi, then I highly recommend it.",5,A great way to relax,1283126400,"08 30, 2010",2010,2135,"[""'ll"", 'admit', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'Scott', 'Cole', 'authentic', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'video', 'can', 'say', 'really', 'it.I', 'have', ""n't"", 'done', 'AM', 'workout', 'very', 'much', 'prefer', 'more', 'vigorous', 'workout', 'early', 'morning', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'video', 'not', ""'ve"", 'only', 'done', 'couple', 'times', 'weekends', 'when', 'can', 'get', 'Y', 'later', 'morning', 'real', 'workout', ""'ve"", 'only', 'done', 'few', 'times', 'have', ""n't"", 'got', 'movements', 'yet', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'entire', 'flow', 'sequence', 'instructions.But', 'absolutely', 'LOVE', 'PM', 'workout', 'do', 'almost', 'night', 'go', 'bed', 'relax', 'day', 'work', 'kids', 'feeling', 'so', 'peaceful', 'relaxed', 'can', 'go', 'right', 'bed', 'fall', 'deeply', 'asleep', 'something', ""n't"", 'been', 'easy', 'segment', 'Scott', 'verbal', 'introduction', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'now', 'forward', 'then', 'talks', 'move', 'individually', 'demonstrating', 'giving', 'time', 'practice', 'explanations', 'demonstrations', 'make', 'very', 'easy', 'follow', 'along', 'Then', 'entire', 'flow', 'sequence', 'giving', 'just', 'name', 'perhaps', 'brief', 'explanation', 'movement', 'finally', 'entire', 'flow', 'sequence', 'words', 'explanation', 'portion', 'segment', 'filmed', 'studio', 'two', 'flow', 'portions', 'segment', 'are', 'filmed', 'beach', 'studio', 'camera', 'angles', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'following', 'along', 'mirror', 'pose', 'Once', 'beach', 'however', 'Scott', 'filmed', 'variety', 'angles', 'so', 'have', ""n't"", 'mastered', 'sequence', 'explanation', 'portion', 'might', 'have', 'difficulty', 'following', 'along.I', 'find', 'Scott', 'Cole', 'be', 'great', 'instructor', 'very', 'encouraging', 'non-judgmental', 'voice', 'gentle', 'soothing', 'easy', 'listen', 'easy', 'look', 'know', 'what', 'mean.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'shape', 'up', 'lose', 'weight', 'video', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', ""'re"", 'looking', 'de-stress', 'as', 'well', 'develop', 'more', 'control', 'mentally', 'physically', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'health', 'benefits', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'then', 'highly', 'recommend']",Scott Cole: Discover Tai Chi AM/PM Workouts
