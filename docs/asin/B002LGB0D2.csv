1276448,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B002LGB0D2,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[3, 3]","Two inept biogeneticists in New Mexico stumble upon a formula that appears to discourage sexual activity among lab rats, providing hope it can be used to curtail rat populations in urban areas.  But our country's simple-minded, religious zealot President at the time, desperately searching for anything to help his popularity rating, hears of it first, and decides to use the untested formula to curtail premarital sex among young people.  He rushes the formula out to the general population, before the inventors determine a rather serious side effect: it turns straight people gay, and gay people straight.  Uh, oh.I really wanted to like this film, figuring a clever satire on this subject, in capable hands, could be both entertaining and enlightening for many people.  Unfortunately, this attempt falls far short of that, and - in my opinion - is remarkable only in the sense that it surpasses ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry"" as the worst gay themed film of the past decade.I realize this is a low budget film, with inexperienced actors, and I don't fault them for that.  However, the whole thing gives the impression it was shot over a long weekend, with much of the dialogue adlibbed to a cartoonish extreme. There is an ongoing bit with reports from ""Fax"" (parody of Fox) News, detailing the results of the formula's mayhem, which was clever the first couple of times it was used, but soon became tedious and overdone. The mostly straight characters became complete stereotypes, once they were ""turned gay,"" and the resulting persecution of heterosexuals (now a minority; a bill is introduced to make heterosexual marriage illegal) could be seen as a justification for discrimination against gays in our real world. At best, the film lets straight viewers with a slight homophobic bent falsely feel like they are being open-minded.DVD has extensive extras, including auditions, table reads, director commentary and stills.  I can't give any more than two stars out of five.",2,"Could have been clever, but this comes off too cartoonish and stereotypical.",1257465600,"11 6, 2009",2009,1987,"['Two', 'inept', 'biogeneticists', 'New', 'Mexico', 'stumble', 'formula', 'discourage', 'sexual', 'activity', 'lab', 'rats', 'providing', 'hope', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'curtail', 'rat', 'populations', 'urban', 'areas', 'country', 'simple-minded', 'religious', 'zealot', 'President', 'time', 'desperately', 'searching', 'anything', 'help', 'popularity', 'rating', 'hears', 'first', 'decides', 'use', 'untested', 'formula', 'curtail', 'premarital', 'sex', 'young', 'people', 'formula', 'general', 'population', 'inventors', 'determine', 'rather', 'serious', 'side', 'effect', 'straight', 'people', 'gay', 'gay', 'people', 'straight', 'Uh', 'oh.I', 'really', 'wanted', 'like', 'film', 'figuring', 'clever', 'satire', 'subject', 'capable', 'hands', 'could', 'be', 'entertaining', 'enlightening', 'many', 'people', 'Unfortunately', 'attempt', 'far', 'short', 'opinion', 'remarkable', 'only', 'sense', 'Now', 'Pronounce', 'Chuck', 'Larry', 'worst', 'gay', 'themed', 'film', 'past', 'decade.I', 'realize', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'inexperienced', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'fault', 'However', 'whole', 'thing', 'impression', 'was', 'shot', 'long', 'weekend', 'much', 'dialogue', 'adlibbed', 'cartoonish', 'extreme', 'ongoing', 'bit', 'reports', 'Fax', 'parody', 'Fox', 'News', 'detailing', 'results', 'formula', 'mayhem', 'was', 'clever', 'first', 'couple', 'times', 'was', 'used', 'soon', 'became', 'tedious', 'overdone', 'mostly', 'straight', 'characters', 'became', 'complete', 'stereotypes', 'once', 'were', 'turned', 'gay', 'resulting', 'persecution', 'heterosexuals', 'now', 'minority', 'bill', 'introduced', 'make', 'heterosexual', 'marriage', 'illegal', 'could', 'be', 'seen', 'justification', 'discrimination', 'gays', 'real', 'world', 'best', 'film', 'lets', 'straight', 'viewers', 'slight', 'homophobic', 'bent', 'falsely', 'feel', 'are', 'being', 'open-minded.DVD', 'extensive', 'extras', 'including', 'auditions', 'table', 'reads', 'director', 'commentary', 'stills', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'more', 'two', 'stars', 'five']",Horror in the Wind
