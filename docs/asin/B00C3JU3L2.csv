1641668,AIS3Q7ISV0WGQ,B00C3JU3L2,Angel,"[9, 13]","Horizon In The Middle of Nowhere II is the next chapter in the extremely popular series. As someone who really enjoyed the first season, I was jumping with joy when I heard there was a second season airing.the story is one of the strongest points in this anime. The historical references in this futuristic anime are quite amusing and interesting. Many battles from our real past are reenacted with an outcome that can be seen a mile away but it still manages to wow you by how it's all played out. Many people are turned off by the over the top ecchi and claim this to have no plot but I can assure you it has a great story. Now that I mentioned the ecchi, I should warn you that there is quite a bit of it. The supporting cast got a lot more screen time this go around and most episodes Tori had little to no interaction with anyone else. This really did develop the rest of the cast well and I believe strengthened the anime. Expect to see a lot of abnormally large bouncing boobs every few seconds. To me it is glorious but some can be easily turned off by that. The comedy is another strong point, Everyone would agree that the Battles are the strength and livelihood of Horizon.Great care and detail is put into crafting every scene perfectly. Laugh worthy comedy, magnificently choreographed conflicts, beautifully integrated music, and compelling characters are thrown into a vast and detailed world to pursue their own goals. I enjoyed every second of it. Hoping season 3 will be announced soon and with 24 episodes, praying when that day comes",5,This Gem keeps on Shinning,1368576000,"05 15, 2013",2013,1553,"['Horizon', 'Middle', 'Nowhere', 'II', 'next', 'chapter', 'extremely', 'popular', 'series', 'someone', 'who', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'jumping', 'joy', 'when', 'heard', 'was', 'second', 'season', 'airing.the', 'story', 'one', 'strongest', 'points', 'anime', 'historical', 'references', 'futuristic', 'anime', 'are', 'quite', 'amusing', 'interesting', 'Many', 'battles', 'real', 'past', 'are', 'reenacted', 'outcome', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'mile', 'away', 'still', 'wow', 'how', 'played', 'out', 'Many', 'people', 'are', 'turned', 'off', 'top', 'ecchi', 'claim', 'have', 'plot', 'can', 'assure', 'great', 'story', 'Now', 'mentioned', 'ecchi', 'should', 'warn', 'quite', 'bit', 'supporting', 'cast', 'got', 'lot', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'go', 'around', 'most', 'episodes', 'Tori', 'had', 'little', 'interaction', 'anyone', 'else', 'really', 'did', 'develop', 'rest', 'cast', 'well', 'believe', 'strengthened', 'anime', 'Expect', 'see', 'lot', 'abnormally', 'large', 'bouncing', 'boobs', 'few', 'seconds', 'glorious', 'can', 'be', 'easily', 'turned', 'off', 'comedy', 'strong', 'point', 'Everyone', 'would', 'agree', 'Battles', 'are', 'strength', 'livelihood', 'Horizon.Great', 'care', 'detail', 'put', 'crafting', 'scene', 'perfectly', 'Laugh', 'worthy', 'comedy', 'magnificently', 'choreographed', 'conflicts', 'beautifully', 'integrated', 'music', 'compelling', 'characters', 'are', 'thrown', 'vast', 'detailed', 'world', 'pursue', 'own', 'goals', 'enjoyed', 'second', 'Hoping', 'season', '3', 'will', 'be', 'announced', 'soon', '24', 'episodes', 'praying', 'when', 'day']",Horizon in the Middle of Nowhere: Season 2

Japan.mix in some Bibilcal references, which I worry many may find disagreeable, women in tight-fitting clothes, and you get this.Did I mention a lot of fighting and violence?There is no sense and logic in all this. And definitely no educational value. Yet a second season has been made. A tragedy for kids of America in my view.This cartoon is definitely banned from my home.",1,A silly cartoon of epic failure,1373328000,"07 9, 2013",2013,507,"['cartoon', 'not', 'make', 'sense', 'all.the', 'setting', 'really', 'just', 'devastated', 'earth', 'only', 'habitable', 'place', 'gasp', 'Japan.mix', 'Bibilcal', 'references', 'worry', 'many', 'may', 'find', 'disagreeable', 'women', 'tight-fitting', 'clothes', 'get', 'this.Did', 'mention', 'lot', 'fighting', 'violence', 'sense', 'logic', 'definitely', 'educational', 'value', 'second', 'season', 'been', 'made', 'tragedy', 'kids', 'America', 'view.This', 'cartoon', 'definitely', 'banned', 'home']",Horizon in the Middle of Nowhere: Season 2
