I sure got my money's worth, even though there is no sermon included, as was promised. That was a big disappointment!I have Billy Graham's biography in book form so I knew about his early years. Still, it was fun to watch on the screen. The acting was wonderful! I had never heard of most of these actors so I was very surprised at how good they all were. Martin Landau, Jennifer O'Neil, and Lindsey Wagner were great, as always.Billy Graham, the man, is a true blessing to all Christians and even non-Christians the world over and it's about time a movie about him was made. I just hope the rest of his life will be covered through film someday. And I hope it's not too far ahead!In this day and age when it's so difficult to find something the entire family can watch, Billy, The Early Years is a gem to stumble across. In fact, I am going to be taking my DVD copy to church for a Family Movie Night real soon.Thank you, Alice Kane",5,A Beautiful Movie!,1270252800,"04 3, 2010",2010,1006,"['too', 'bought', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'local', 'Wal*Mart', 'just', '9.00', 'sure', 'got', 'money', 'worth', 'even', 'sermon', 'included', 'was', 'promised', 'was', 'big', 'disappointment', 'have', 'Billy', 'Graham', 'biography', 'book', 'form', 'knew', 'early', 'years', 'Still', 'was', 'fun', 'watch', 'screen', 'acting', 'was', 'wonderful', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'most', 'actors', 'so', 'was', 'very', 'surprised', 'how', 'good', 'were', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'Jennifer', ""O'Neil"", 'Lindsey', 'Wagner', 'were', 'great', 'always.Billy', 'Graham', 'man', 'true', 'blessing', 'Christians', 'even', 'non-Christians', 'world', 'time', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'just', 'hope', 'rest', 'life', 'will', 'be', 'covered', 'film', 'someday', 'hope', 'not', 'too', 'far', 'ahead', 'day', 'age', 'when', 'so', 'difficult', 'find', 'something', 'entire', 'family', 'can', 'watch', 'Billy', 'Early', 'Years', 'gem', 'stumble', 'across', 'fact', 'am', 'going', 'be', 'taking', 'DVD', 'copy', 'church', 'Family', 'Movie', 'Night', 'real', 'soon.Thank', 'Alice', 'Kane']",N/A

Much to my delight it is an excellent movie.  The story of Billy Graham's early years is told through the eyes of Dr. Templeton, a friend turned harsh critic of Billy Graham's.  He is being interviewed in the nursing home and the actor portraying him is most convincing.  As the story goes, Billy Graham aspired to be a baseball player.  His family had a dairy farm so while not starving during The Great Depression as many were, they weren't a gilded age family either.  He goes to a revival led by Dr. Ham and feels drawn to a higher calling of serving The Lord.  The actor portraying Billy does a good job of being the young love struck fellow.  And the romantic story is a sweet one.  Incidentally, I didn't know Ruth Bell Graham had a little bit of a feminist streak in her until this movie.  That was neat to discover!  We are led through the story of how Templeton hits his crisis in Faith and Billy hits a stumbling block in preaching The Word.  But eventually he realizes that Faith is the key and his evangelizing soars.  The actor portrayed the preaching a little bit more animated in nature than I've heard Billy Graham do.  But then I don't know much about his early years.  In the end, the movie leaves one wanting to watch more, it is that good of a film.  There is only one swear word in the movie and other than that, it is a very clean and family friendly motion picture.",5,A very good film.,1329350400,"02 16, 2012",2012,1489,"['bought', 'movie', 'local', 'Lifeway', 'Christian', 'Bookstore', 'watched', 'very', 'same', 'evening', 'Much', 'delight', 'excellent', 'movie', 'story', 'Billy', 'Graham', 'early', 'years', 'told', 'eyes', 'Dr.', 'Templeton', 'friend', 'turned', 'harsh', 'critic', 'Billy', 'Graham', 'being', 'interviewed', 'nursing', 'home', 'actor', 'portraying', 'most', 'convincing', 'story', 'Billy', 'Graham', 'aspired', 'be', 'baseball', 'player', 'family', 'had', 'dairy', 'farm', 'so', 'not', 'starving', 'Great', 'Depression', 'many', 'were', 'were', ""n't"", 'gilded', 'age', 'family', 'either', 'revival', 'led', 'Dr.', 'Ham', 'feels', 'drawn', 'higher', 'calling', 'serving', 'Lord', 'actor', 'portraying', 'Billy', 'good', 'job', 'being', 'young', 'love', 'struck', 'fellow', 'romantic', 'story', 'sweet', 'one', 'Incidentally', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'Ruth', 'Bell', 'Graham', 'had', 'little', 'bit', 'feminist', 'streak', 'movie', 'was', 'neat', 'discover', 'are', 'led', 'story', 'how', 'Templeton', 'crisis', 'Faith', 'Billy', 'stumbling', 'block', 'preaching', 'Word', 'eventually', 'Faith', 'key', 'evangelizing', 'soars', 'actor', 'portrayed', 'preaching', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'animated', 'nature', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'Billy', 'Graham', 'do', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'early', 'years', 'end', 'movie', 'one', 'wanting', 'watch', 'more', 'good', 'film', 'only', 'one', 'swear', 'word', 'movie', 'other', 'very', 'clean', 'family', 'friendly', 'motion', 'picture']",N/A

1319455,A2W2ODLRQ2L8LE,B0032W5Z94,G. Max Gooding,"[10, 11]","Background:William Franklin ""Billy"" Graham, Jr.  was born on November 7, 1918 to William Franklin Graham I (1888-1962) and Morrow Coffey (1892-1981). He grew up on a dairy farm near Charlotte, North Carolina. He was raised in the Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church. However, it was only when he attended a series of revival meetings in Charlotte which were led by evangelist Mordecai Ham in 1934 that he truly accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as his personal Lord and Savior. He was 16 years old.He attended Sharon High School until May 1936. He then went attended Bob Jones College (Tennesse) for one semester before transferring to the Florida Bible Institute in 1937. It was here that he received his calling to preach the Gospel. Subsequently in 1943, Graham graduated from Wheaton College in Wheaton, Illinois with a degree in anthropology. In August of that year he also married his classmate Ruth Bell (1920-2007). They had five children together. While attending this college, he became pastor of the United Gospel Tabernacle and also had other preaching engagements.Storyline/Presentation:This movie is unfolded by the recollections of Billy Graham's early mentor in the ministry, Charles Templeton (Martin Landau). These two men became very good friends as they ministered the Word together. However, at the end of World War II, as Templeton views the images of the Holocaust, his faith in God starts to diminish. Hence as Graham starts to be more well recognized and established, Templeton, turns his back on his flock and takes up a secular position instead.This film obviously, is not your typical 'white wash' Christian movie, but it delves into the heart of man, and their frailties. No punches are held back, in doing so, we begin to comprehend how some ministers of the Gospel fail and do not finish their race successfully.Conclusion:This film appears to be a true reflection of the early years of Billy Graham, however, without some background information you may find it difficult to follow the story along. I feel that the producers could have lenghtened the film a bit so that the reasons for his college transitions could have been presented more clearly.",5,Evangelist Extraordinaire,1293408000,"12 27, 2010",2010,2180,"['Background', 'William', 'Franklin', 'Billy', 'Graham', 'Jr.', 'was', 'born', 'November', '7', '1918', 'William', 'Franklin', 'Graham', '1888-1962', 'Morrow', 'Coffey', '1892-1981', 'grew', 'up', 'dairy', 'farm', 'Charlotte', 'North', 'Carolina', 'was', 'raised', 'Associate', 'Reformed', 'Presbyterian', 'Church', 'However', 'was', 'only', 'when', 'attended', 'series', 'revival', 'meetings', 'Charlotte', 'were', 'led', 'evangelist', 'Mordecai', 'Ham', '1934', 'truly', 'accepted', 'Lord', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'personal', 'Lord', 'Savior', 'was', '16', 'years', 'old.He', 'attended', 'Sharon', 'High', 'School', 'May', '1936', 'then', 'went', 'attended', 'Bob', 'Jones', 'College', 'Tennesse', 'one', 'semester', 'transferring', 'Florida', 'Bible', 'Institute', '1937', 'was', 'here', 'received', 'calling', 'preach', 'Gospel', 'Subsequently', '1943', 'Graham', 'graduated', 'Wheaton', 'College', 'Wheaton', 'Illinois', 'degree', 'anthropology', 'August', 'year', 'also', 'married', 'classmate', 'Ruth', 'Bell', '1920-2007', 'had', 'five', 'children', 'together', 'attending', 'college', 'became', 'pastor', 'United', 'Gospel', 'Tabernacle', 'also', 'had', 'other', 'preaching', 'engagements.Storyline/Presentation', 'movie', 'unfolded', 'recollections', 'Billy', 'Graham', 'early', 'mentor', 'ministry', 'Charles', 'Templeton', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'two', 'men', 'became', 'very', 'good', 'friends', 'ministered', 'Word', 'together', 'However', 'end', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Templeton', 'images', 'Holocaust', 'faith', 'God', 'diminish', 'Hence', 'Graham', 'be', 'more', 'well', 'recognized', 'established', 'Templeton', 'back', 'flock', 'up', 'secular', 'position', 'instead.This', 'film', 'obviously', 'not', 'typical', ""'white"", 'wash', 'Christian', 'movie', 'heart', 'man', 'frailties', 'punches', 'are', 'held', 'back', 'doing', 'so', 'begin', 'comprehend', 'how', 'ministers', 'Gospel', 'fail', 'do', 'not', 'finish', 'race', 'successfully.Conclusion', 'film', 'be', 'true', 'reflection', 'early', 'years', 'Billy', 'Graham', 'however', 'background', 'information', 'may', 'find', 'difficult', 'follow', 'story', 'feel', 'producers', 'could', 'have', 'lenghtened', 'film', 'bit', 'so', 'reasons', 'college', 'transitions', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'presented', 'more', 'clearly']",N/A

1319463,A22MQ2OAHY8SIJ,B0032W5Z94,"KittyKins ""KittyKins""","[2, 2]","This is a wonderful movie on so many different levels.  In many ways it is the story of two men, Billy Graham and Charles Templeton, and highlights the consequences that each man has as a result of his faith choices. Providing a contrast between the two men's lives made the main message all the more meaningful. One of its strengths is that it does not water down the faith elements and beautifully presents Billy Graham's call to the ministry.  The balance of faith, humour, romance, and dealing with real issues, makes for a very well-rounded film.  One of the strong messages of the movie is that God will never leave or forsake us, and it encourages people to come to true faith in Jesus Christ through its accurate portrayal of the Gospel message.First of all it is well acted by the entire cast from major to minor characters. Armie Hammer portrays Billy Graham brilliantly and is careful not to overplay the role.  He is also an actor with impeccable comedic timing and this adds to the story as well by presenting Billy as just a regular fellow with a calling to preach the Gospel. The only weakness is with the portrayal of his mixed, and rather complex, accent. However, Armie's presentation of Billy as a man, and not as a spiritual icon, is really well done.  Lindsay Wagner plays his mother and also has a standout performance.  I was surprised to see Scott Hamilton, the figure skater, in a minor role.  He does a good job as well!  I also like Cliff Bemis' performance as Dr. Ham and Kristoffer Polaha as the younger Charles Templeton.*Spoiler Paragraph:  Part of the story is told through an aging Charles Templeton, who talks to news reporters about his friendship with Billy Graham from his hospital bed.  He also mentions his own spiritual conversion and as an aging man seems to have regrets about his life choices.  The real Charles reported seeing angels and said he missed Jesus before he died.  In the film, it shows Charles' journey and how he falls into unbelief as a younger man.  He becomes disillusioned after the war as he can't understand why God allows such horrible things to happen to innocent people, and he also begins to doubt the Divine inspiration of Scripture.  I find the scenes with Billy Graham's conversion at a Dr. Mordecai Ham crusade and the spiritual climax in the film to be extremely moving and well done.  The romance between Billy & Ruth is very sweet.  Although it may not have happened exactly like that, it makes for a good story and is respectful of both of them.*Reactions from the Graham family have been mixed. Billy Graham's oldest daughter, Gigi, and Ruth Bell Graham's sister have both said that they love the film, and I have to say that their characters are both in the film as well. Apparently Ruth Bell Graham never threw a baseball? However, to me this is small potatoes and not at all what the film is about. I feel the screenwriter was just trying to connect Billy's love for baseball at the beginning of the film, with an activity that many couples do together. She was a strong woman and this was nicely presented in this way. The scene when Bob Jones tells Billy he will not amount to anything, which was the one thing that apparently caused some embarrassment for the Graham family, was not included on the dvd. However, Billy Graham mentions the occurrence in his auto-biography himself, so perhaps sometimes the truth is harder to take than fiction. My feeling is that the Graham family could come out with a more accurate biographical film, but I for one will keep coming back to this charming film.

This DVD tells the rest of that story, and it was very interesting.The narrative begins with Billy Graham as a young man living at his parent's home, and how he came to be called into the ministry.  We also learn about the person he almost married, and the one he did--and how he met her.  We see how one of Billy Graham's very best friends in the ministry lets him down, and then ridicules him publicly.  It is very easy to identify with Billy Graham in the different situations portrayed.This movie definitely keeps your interest, some parts are funny and some are sad.  Even if Billy Graham were not a public figure, this would be an account worth watching.  Even though there were not any big name actors in this film, it was well done and enjoyable.  I am a long-time admirer of Dr. Graham, and came forward at one of his crusades when I was twelve years old.  Learning Dr. Graham's history made me respect him even more.The movie is suitable for all ages and clean.

Armie Hammer does a fantastic job of portraying a young farm boy who believes God wants him to preach; along the way he stumbles yet grows while learning how to preach.  One of the finest scenes for me was him preaching to a passing crowd while only one man responds, 'no one wants anything to do with me' and Billy says &#34;God does&#34;, and embraces the black man pouring out his heart.  Then the wonderful scenes of a nervous lovestruck college student hopelessly falling for Ruth, who becomes his one and only the rest of her life.  So many other poignant scenes with Charles Templeton, becoming youngest president of a Bible college, and ending with his famous 1949 Los Angeles Tent Crusade (which both of my parents attended).
