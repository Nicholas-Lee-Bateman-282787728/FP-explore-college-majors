1664846,AOB5695UUUJ0,B00E687FA0,"Anime Lover ""D""","[16, 16]","Shougo is the heir apparent to a large business conglomerate and only child to the president.  However on the day of the funeral, a lady's voice comes through the window telling him that she is his little sister and wishes to marry him.  One year later he transfers to his new school with the understanding that he need to find a nice girl and marry her before he graduates (good thing he is a second year).  And he is surrounded by a lot of lovely ladies, until a mysterious caller calls and lets him know that his little sister is at the exact same school.  Now he must not only be careful on who he falls in love with, but also narrow down his search and find the sister he never knew he had.Despite what the other reviewer says, this is not a rip of Onegai Twins (one of my favorite series)(though Episode 3 did have that feel, but it was a lot more entertaining than Twins Episode 3 was).  You have a slew of potential suitors/sisters from the cute girl next door, to the rich blonde, to the mysterious store owner - each one with their own unique personalities and character story that just draws you in as you watch Shougo go through to find true love, but hopefully not with the sister he also wishes to be united with.  You will enjoy this series if you enjoy a good story with a mystery and the chance for happiness for all involved.",4,A good series full of twists and turns,1382400000,"10 22, 2013",2013,1343,"['Shougo', 'heir', 'apparent', 'large', 'business', 'conglomerate', 'only', 'child', 'president', 'However', 'day', 'funeral', 'lady', 'voice', 'window', 'telling', 'little', 'sister', 'wishes', 'marry', 'One', 'year', 'later', 'new', 'school', 'understanding', 'need', 'find', 'nice', 'girl', 'marry', 'good', 'thing', 'second', 'year', 'surrounded', 'lot', 'lovely', 'ladies', 'mysterious', 'caller', 'calls', 'know', 'little', 'sister', 'exact', 'same', 'school', 'Now', 'must', 'not', 'only', 'be', 'careful', 'who', 'love', 'also', 'narrow', 'down', 'search', 'find', 'sister', 'never', 'knew', 'had.Despite', 'what', 'other', 'reviewer', 'not', 'rip', 'Onegai', 'Twins', 'one', 'favorite', 'series', 'Episode', '3', 'did', 'have', 'feel', 'was', 'lot', 'more', 'entertaining', 'Twins', 'Episode', '3', 'was', 'have', 'slew', 'potential', 'suitors/sisters', 'cute', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'rich', 'blonde', 'mysterious', 'store', 'owner', 'one', 'own', 'unique', 'personalities', 'character', 'story', 'just', 'watch', 'Shougo', 'go', 'find', 'true', 'love', 'hopefully', 'not', 'sister', 'also', 'be', 'united', 'will', 'enjoy', 'series', 'enjoy', 'good', 'story', 'mystery', 'chance', 'happiness', 'involved']",N/A

I can honestly say that this has so few redeeming qualities, you would have more fun studying physics.  At any rate, watch it and come to your own conclusion; however, for my two cents, there are much (MUCH...Steins:Gate, Beck, Gundam, Sword Art Online, etc...) better series out there to enjoy.Frankly, I do not usually review stuff I rate as low as this, preferring to provide opinion on series I find exceptional, but because this one was such a blatant copy, I couldn't keep quiet.",2,Meh...,1382227200,"10 20, 2013",2013,599,"['First', 'off', 'pretty', 'much', 'ripoff', 'Please', 'Twins', 'Johnny', 'Yong', 'Bosch', 'Kari', 'Walhgren', 'kickin', '@', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'so', 'few', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'would', 'have', 'more', 'fun', 'studying', 'physics', 'rate', 'watch', 'come', 'own', 'conclusion', 'however', 'two', 'cents', 'are', 'much', 'MUCH', 'Gate', 'Beck', 'Gundam', 'Sword', 'Art', 'Online', 'etc', 'better', 'series', 'there', 'enjoy.Frankly', 'do', 'not', 'usually', 'review', 'stuff', 'rate', 'as', 'low', 'preferring', 'provide', 'opinion', 'series', 'find', 'exceptional', 'one', 'was', 'such', 'blatant', 'copy', 'could', ""n't"", 'keep', 'quiet']",N/A

1664851,A195PLFQV0UARO,B00E687FA0,Solace,"[2, 2]","This series contains some nudity/fan service and is not suitable for children.An average series, nothing mind blowing in concept or execution.  The animation was pretty good, the girls were cute, and the Japanese voice acting was good.  The plot line was an interesting twist to the typical harem themed comedy.  The mystery of course is which girl is the biological little half-sister.  Each episode seems to eliminate a potential candidate... until what you think you know is thrown out the window at the end and the actual sister is identified.I slowly lost enthusiasm from episode to episode.  The humor is OK, nothing new.  Each character has a decent background story and you become interested in their lives.. but the series seemed to stretch on.  While the &#34;question&#34; of whose who is answered, there isn't a resolution at the end of the series.  This would prompt a season 2.. but I'm not sure it was interesting enough for me to buy it when/if it becomes available.No real negatives, almost 4 stars, but it the story just lacked the depth to get there.",3,Had potential,1402012800,"06 6, 2014",2014,1069,"['series', 'nudity/fan', 'service', 'not', 'suitable', 'children.An', 'average', 'series', 'nothing', 'mind', 'blowing', 'concept', 'execution', 'animation', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'girls', 'were', 'cute', 'Japanese', 'voice', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'plot', 'line', 'was', 'interesting', 'twist', 'typical', 'harem', 'themed', 'comedy', 'mystery', 'course', 'girl', 'biological', 'little', 'half-sister', 'episode', 'eliminate', 'potential', 'candidate', 'what', 'think', 'know', 'thrown', 'out', 'window', 'end', 'actual', 'sister', 'identified.I', 'slowly', 'lost', 'enthusiasm', 'episode', 'episode', 'humor', 'OK', 'nothing', 'new', 'character', 'decent', 'background', 'story', 'become', 'interested', 'lives..', 'series', 'seemed', 'stretch', '34', 'question', '34', 'who', 'answered', ""n't"", 'resolution', 'end', 'series', 'would', 'prompt', 'season', '2..', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'interesting', 'enough', 'buy', 'available.No', 'real', 'negatives', 'almost', '4', 'stars', 'story', 'just', 'lacked', 'depth', 'get', 'there']",N/A
