1136091,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B00128VA6C,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[5, 6]","Splitting kindergarteners into groups, I was given the privilege of assigning names for each group.  I was surprised to learn that about two-thirds of them had recently seen `The Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (Widescreen Edition),' so I knew names like Aslan, Mr. Tumnus, and the beavers would mean something special to them.  `Weren't you scared when the wolves showed up?' I asked.  `No,' they said in unison if not with some amusement.  The thought hadn't occurred to them, even if their embarrassed teacher wouldn't admit he got a jolt every time the wily beasts made their appearance.What does that have to do with `Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium'?  Well, it has to do with audience appeal.  For some this movie will be only for primary purposes, say pre-school to third grade.  For me I was enchanted, but for some the digitalized special effects will seem ho-hum, and cynics will not even want to ride along.  With today's standards, even some of those kindergarteners may be underwhelmed by this film.For all his inviting charm, Dustin Hoffman plays Edward Magorium, a soft spoken Willy Wonka with a lisp.  He's 243 years old, and his life is measured by the nifty pair of shoes he bought in Tuscany.  When his last pair wears out, he's done.  (Maybe I'm being too philosophical, but most of us--myself included--can hardly be trusted with that much time.)He laudably puts the majority of his life span into his Emporium, a free-for-all place--that in my estimation--comes to life.  A magic inventory book summons a wish list, duck-duck goose takes literal form, and a perpetual paper air plane flies around the store.  These are just tasters, for the pacing of their unveiling is magical enough for me.  (I don't want to give away the whole store--sorry!)Just like in `Willy Wonka' Magorium is looking for a successor to his emporium.  Mollie Mahoney (Natalie Portman) heads his staff, but while she believes in the magic, she pines to be a professional pianist and doesn't feel worthy to take his place.  The toy store seems to agree as it starts to turn grey in its foundations as the turnover becomes imminent.The story unfolds like a book, complete with chapters as their created by a book builder (Ted Ludzek).  Balancing the skeptic/believer schism are an accountant and a kid.  Young Eric (Zack Mills) imitates his hero by sporting a collection of hats; sober Henry Westin (Jason Bateman) can't seem to smile, let alone loosen up to play checkers.  Edward Magorium isn't worried, for he's reassuring to Molly, and hiring Henry to assess the place was his idea.Looking at the movie posters, I thought, `Well, it looks nice, but...How much can they do with a toy store?'  The answer is they do enough with the toy store, but what they do to the story is even better.  Predictable in places, I was still smitten by the interplay of budding romance and childhood whimsy.  Given the simple, but effective soundtrack and Mills' narration, and you're given one sweet and solid movie.

I have now seen this film 3 times - the last being the bluray version which I had to purchase.  The film itself has an amazing cast who create a great ensemble.  No one tries to steal the show and they all inhabit their characters fully and with care as if they know the special story they are telling.  The story, message and magical wonder emporium itself are the true stars here.Dutin Hoffman as the store owner is magical and Natalie Portman and Jason Bateman shine on screen as they do some of their best work.  Child actor Zach Mills is a revelation and gives a truly tender, heartfelt performance.  In this day and age with so much tragedy sometimes we forget to feel good and that pleasure can be found in some of the simplest places.  This film shows the viewer that life can be looked at with a positive outlook, definitely tells us to never forget our dreams and that the child in us has the right to always be in the forefront.  Love, sharing and casring are what makes the world go round.Bluray is also a magical gift in itself to film lovers and this movie was created for bluray presentation.  The whole movie is crisp with vivid color and strong detail.  Everything pops out and the store itself is a thing of beauty.  The whole film shines.  It is so clear that some scenes that were shot with a spotlight on the main action appears like a play.  The film becomes a magical stage with the special light highlighting the action.I had to give this film 4 stars and not 5 for I try to review honestly.  It is one of my true favorites and is nowe part of my bluray collection.  It is a magical joyful experience all should have but it does lack that certain oomph to make it a masterpiece.  Believe me, the 4 star rating is meant in no way to say the film is not brilliant.  Please give yourself the experience of viewing this film and remebering what is good in this world.

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[1, 4]","Before I get started on this review, let me say that I've enjoyed most of Dustin Hoffman's films.The GraduateandRain Manare the ones that stand out most but he's done intervening work that entertained, too. He has, however, been involved in a few clunkers. Things like the questionableSphereand the stomach churningIshtarshow that he needs to be a bit choosey when deciding on film roles. Which brings us to MR. MAGORIUM'S WONDER EMPORIUM...Hoffman's portrayal of Mr. Magorium is pretty unique, if not sexually confusing; an unmarried 243-year-old man with a lisp and colorful outfits? {that was a joke, by the way} Mr. Hoffman does play the role very well. He was the shining star in an otherwise slipshod script.The problems are many, but the biggies are the lack of secondary character development and an extremely rushed series of events, particularly the ending. Examples:The movie packed zero emotional punch when a main character dies. Zach Mills (Hollywoodland) who plays a vital role as the young and lonely Eric doesn't really shine, even when he tries to reach out to accountant Mark Loring (Jason Bateman,The Kingdom) and make friends. It is cute but that's about it.Natalie Portman (The Darjeeling Limited) stars as Molly, the surprising heir-in-interest of this magical -- and alive -- emporium. But even Portman's tearful and soft face couldn't hold the story up. The short 93 minute run-time of the film allowed for minimal immersion into her character and the aforementioned rush to the finish.Probably the most interesting character wasn't a character at all and had very little screen time (which was a shame because I wanted to know more about it). I'm speaking, of course, about the emporium building itself, which goes into a temper tantrum and dark mood when it learns that Mr. Magorium plans to ""leave.""There are some interesting shots and ideas, however. The turning of a dial near a doorway produces different exit points when the door is opened. Toys come to life if they feel nearby emotion (fear, love, etc.). And the idea that someone must move on so that others can learn and become more human is cliche but came off okay if a bit forced.The other good thing is that this film holds very little that would upset the parents of young kids.

We get an inkling about Molly being lost and get an idea that Bateman's character doesn't have as much fun as he should, but we really know little about Mr Magorium. Despite his 243 years, we have no knowledge of who he interacted with over the centuries: which famous people might have walked through those doors to get a toy that they cherished throughout their lives. Hoffman appears to be doing a homage to Ed Wynn in his mannerism and delivery, yet overall I wanted more from this flick. Why does only the monkey toy beckon to Bateman of all the toys on the wall? For a while I thought it was a toy he had long forgotten about. That would have been a better hook to pull Bateman's character into believing the store's magic (realising something he'd lost; finding again a cherished toy that cherished him).

1136107,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B00128VA6C,Chris Pandolfi,"[3, 3]","What a charming movie ""Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium"" is; here's a film that's delightful, fun, and touching without getting too sentimental. Not that the story is free from sentiment--many key moments tap into a number of emotions, many of which we thought we had abandoned long ago. Watching this film, my belief in the power of positive thinking was refreshed, and I'll thank you to not make fun of me for saying something so hokey. Much like the toy store owned by the eccentric yet loveable Edward Margorium, the film thrives on magic and whimsy, with a plot that instills a positive message without getting sappy. It was thoroughly delightful to watch something so upbeat.Some have dismissed this film as being a watered down rehash of ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory."" I do understand how that comparison can be made; both films include oddball lead characters and magical, kid-friendly environments. Nonetheless, ""Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium"" stands on its own, having the power to entrance its audience with a meaningful story, humorous characters, and a wealth of creative special effects. Basically, it feels as bright and colorful as it looks, and we begin to feel joyous as soon as the opening credits begin to roll. Immediately after that, a voiceover narration introduces us to Bellini (Ted Ludzik), the bookmaker for Mr. Magorium's toyshop and his personal historian. From this, we learn that the film will be divided into chapters, each one covering the events that led to big changes.The most important character, obviously, is Mr. Magorium (Dustin Hoffman), a 243-year-old free spirit who operates a living toy store. Behind certain doors, rooms can change with the flick of a switch. An inventory book can produce a toy in the blink of an eye. Toys are able to operate on their own. Balls bounce by themselves. A mobile has living fresh-water fish hanging from strings. Stuffed animals reach out and beg to be hugged. The store's manager is Molly Mahoney (Natalie Portman), an incredibly insecure young woman desperate to find her purpose in life. A marvelous pianist, she's unable to escape the world of prewritten music; she wants to compose an original piece. But something is holding her back, something strong enough to leave her frustrated while sitting behind a keyboard. She knows there's more to herself, but she doesn't know what it is or how to free it. As happy as she is working for Mr. Magorium, she feels stuck.After running the shop for over one hundred years, Mr. Magorium decides that it's time to leave (and I won't get more specific than that). To sort out the financial details--of which he had never given any thought to--he hires an accountant named Henry Weston (Jason Bateman). He's immediately given the nickname Mutant, not only because Mr. Magorium believes it's the suffix to ""accountant,"" but also because he's an uptight workaholic that doesn't believe in magic. From his point of view, nothing extraordinary happens in the store; it's a place where kids buy things, and nothing more. Mahoney says he sees everything in terms of the word ""just""--it's ""just"" a toy store, and it ""just"" sells ordinary things. Doing paperwork and talking business is all he knows how to do, which is why he thinks nothing of pointing out suspicious financial activity to Mr. Magorium. Example: when Mutant addresses doing business with imaginary characters like the King of Planet Yahweh, Mr. Magorium says, ""Oh, he's not imaginary. He was never a king, and Planet Yahweh doesn't exist, but he's real.""Frequenting the store is nine-year-old Eric Applebaum (Zach Mills), who also serves as the film's narrator. I loved this character; he's articulate and witty, and in some ways, he's just as eccentric as Mr. Magorium. For one thing, he has an impressive hat collection, and he wears a different one every single day. He can also build a life-sized state of Abraham Lincolm out of Lincoln Logs. But as approachable as he seems, he has absolutely no friends, save for Mahoney and Mr. Magorium. They both pressure him to be more outgoing, but he holds himself back because everyone his age has labeled him as weird and unlikable. He finally begins to engage Mutant, who gradually relearns how to have some fun. There's a wonderful scene in which they have a conversation through a window; they communicate by writing messages on pieces of paper and holding them up.Mr. Magorium tells Mahoney that, upon his departure, she'll be the sole owner of the Wonder Emporium. Her self-confidence plummets--how can she operate a business without the man who started it? And what if she doesn't want to be the owner? What if she wants to pursue a career in music? The store itself also takes the news pretty badly, as seen when it's bright red walls turn gray and the toys go berserk. Much like an infant child, it throws a temper tantrum, forcing Mr. Magorium to temporarily close the store. Even for a man that owns a pet zebra and actually helped Thomas Edison invent the light bulb, this is simply too bizarre; everything must be smoothed out before he leaves, and in order for that to happen, he has to have the full cooperation of the store, of Mahoney, and of Mutant.There are many, many subtler nuances that make ""Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium"" a truly enjoyable film, such as a machine that dresses people, a living dinosaur skeleton made of wood, and a cameo appearance by Kermit the Frog. But what I enjoyed the most was its emotional core; I actually felt happy when I left the theater, not only because I had watched a fun film, but also because it actually resonated with me on a deeper level. This is an enchanting story--I recommend it to everyone, young and old alike.",4,Let's Hear it for the Toys,1195516800,"11 20, 2007",2007,5712,"['What', 'charming', 'movie', 'Mr.', 'Magorium',

1136108,AUHG8KSHI529U,B00128VA6C,Craig Matteson,"[8, 9]","OK, I didn't quite know what to make of this movie.  It has its charms.  Unlike some folks, I didn't mind Dustin Hoffman's choice of hair and lisp for Mr. Magorium.  The man is supposed to be more than two hundred years old, magical, and imbued with a childlike wonder of life.  Yet, the story really isn't about him.  The story is about Molly Mahoney, played by Natalie Portman (one of the actors I always enjoy).  She was a child prodigy on the piano who, the story says, played the Rachmaninoff Second Piano Concerto.  Yeah, right.  No one who could actually play that concerto as a child would ever find there way behind the counter of a toy store.  The sad history of prodigies does indicate a poor chance for her to progress into permanent pianistic stardom, but she would likely stay in music or head into some other intellectual profession.  Oh, and the kind of music the movie has her ""composing"" and playing is just absurd.  Portman's hands look as if they have had lessons and played the piano, but they are not hands strong enough or experienced enough for a big concerto.  As the Master Thespian used to declare, ""Acting!""Magorium hires an accountant, a counting-mutant, to help him figure out what the store is worth since he has never even seen a receipt.  The hiring of Henry Weston (played by Jason Bateman - whom I also always enjoy) is one of the more delightful scenes in the movie.  Of course the store is in a state beyond disarray.  Magorium isn't big on explaining why he wants the Mutant (as he is affectionately called).  The other delightful character in the movie is Eric Applebaum (delightfully done by Zach Mills).  Eric is a lonely boy with amazing creativity, a superb collection of hats, and zero friends.  Given his personality that seems as impossible as Molly's playing Rachmaninoff.The store Magorium runs is indeed magical, and we are given abundant evidence of it.  However, it understands Magorium's secret, as do some of the toys, and none are happy about it.  Magorium intends to give the store to Molly, who doesn't want it because she wants Magorium to stay.  He can't or won't.  The store turns entirely black after he goes and Molly intends to sell it.  But Eric and the Mutant want her to keep it.  The climax of the story, which is about the power of being aware of the magic that is your life and the power of believing in yourself, is whether or not Molly can bring the store to its former glory or whether she lets it slip away.  Take a big guess.So, some of the things in the story didn't work for me.  I didn't like that no one has an actual complete family.  Magorium's history is largely never discussed nor is how he lived to be a couple of hundred years old.  We do learn about his delight in the kind of shoes wears.  Molly is alone except for the store (no boyfriend, fianc&eacute;, mother, or father), Eric has a Mom but only because he is nine.  She doesn't do much except fret.  The Mutant is as alone and as detached Molly.  And the issue surrounding Magorium's decision actually makes no sense and has nothing of the weight such events have in real life.Yet, my opinion of the movie changed when my five year old granddaughter watched it.  She was delighted and mesmerized and demanded to see it again immediately.  And she has watched it twice more since.  So, there is obviously something about the movie that is compelling to a small child that escapes me as an adult, deeply into the realities of life.  Hmmmm... take that for what you will and I added a star because of my grandchild's enthusiasm.  It is not a bad movie.  The special effects are a bit much.  However, it is successful for the kids.

In this age of crass commercialism, this film celebrates idealism and imagination - things that our world so desperately needs.Dustin Hoffman portrays Magorium as an optimistic Willy Wonka-type who is a genius toy maker and has a pet zebra in his home. He runs a magical toy store complete with an enormous book that lists the store's entire inventory and going to the appropriate page magically produces said toy. Each character has their own dilemma to resolve: Eric has to make a friend; Henry has to learn how to have fun, and Molly's desire to create music instead of running the Emporium. The cast is uniformly excellent, from Natalie Portman's engaging turn as Molly to Jason Bateman as the button-down accountant.There is an absolutely charming scene where Henry and Eric communicate on opposite sides of a pane of glass via handwritten messages to the Cat Stevens' song, ""Don't Be Shy"" that demonstrates director Zach Helm's skill a visual storyteller. It was at this moment that I wondered if he is a fan of Hal Ashby's films as this song was used prominently inHarold and Maude. This hunch was confirmed with Ashby's surname popping up in a scene as a store name. It is these little touches, like the nervous slinky or the gigantic dodge ball that fills an entire room or Magorium's hospital room at night decorated with many glow-in-the-dark stars, that make this film such a joy to watch.He adopts a vibrant colour scheme with the larger shocks of colour being primary in nature and then the smaller details (toys and clothes) comprised of secondary and tertiary colours. For example, the hospital that Magorium stays in is dominated by golden yellows while warm, brown wood dominates the Emporium. The entire film is like a giant box of Crayola crayons exploded all over it.Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium is not at all what I expected it to be (to be honest, I had little to no expectations) and was pleasantly surprised by how charming and imaginative this film turned out to be. It makes a convincing argument for keeping magic and wonderment alive. So often we grow up and either lose or ignore these feelings. There's more to life than dollars and sense. Mr. Magorium is a wonderful film that appeals to your heart without being so obviously manipulative and celebrates imagination over conformity. It also appeals to children with condescending to them and to adults who haven't forgotten what it's like to be a kid.""Strangely Weird and Weirdly Strange: The Magical World of a Wonder Emporium"" is comprised of four featurettes that take brief looks at various aspects of the film. The first one features cast and crew praising director Zach Helm. Another takes a look at how the Sock Monkey puppet works. We also see how the production dealt with an actual zebra on the set. Finally, we see how the life-sized sculpture of President Abraham Lincoln was made entirely out of Lincoln Logs.""An Eccentric Boss and An Awkward Apprentice"" takes a look at the characters of Mr. Magorium and Molly Mahoney. Not surprisingly, the actors were drawn to the project because of the well-written script. Cast and crew speak highly of Hoffman and Portman. The two actors describe their characters.""To Meet Eric Applebaum, Start by Saying Hi"" takes a look at Eric and the actor who plays him, Zach Mills.

There are, to a degree, some parallels withWilly Wonka & the Chocolate Factory [HD DVD].  However, for the most part it is its own movie.  It centers around a man (played by Dustin Hoffman) who wishes to leave the management / ownership of his magical toy store to his favorite employee (portrayed by Natalie Portman) as he can sense that his end is near.  Unfortunately, Portman's character is apprehensive about taking over the toy store, mostly stemming from a lack of self-confidence.To be sure, many will say that this film is predictable, and so it is.  However, the people who criticize it on such grounds are, I believe, missing the point.  Granted, there are no real ""hooks"" in the plot or plot-twists that will keep you guessing.  So what?  In a movie like this, it really doesn't matter.  At base, to me the film is not so much about the story itself as it is about how we all used to look upon the world with such  a sense of wonder when we were children.  People who are only looking for surprises are not prone to ""getting it"" insofar as this DVD is concerned.The casting is terrific with Hoffmann and Portman leading the way.  Hoffmann gets his chance to play a sort of pseudo-Santa Clause, and it's evident that he enjoyed himself immensely.  I've always like Portman, and it's nice to see a young woman who is both a fine actress as well as a great person.  She is kind of the antipode to ""bad girls"" like Lindsay Lohan.If you are the parent of small children, I'd highly recommend this film.

With a title that rhymes like that, what would you expect beside the magical sweetness that just happens to be accepted by the world? I was quickly drawn in by this storybook world where the bizarre and quirky is just a way of life and no one thinks much more of it. Throw in a beautiful message of finding yourself, and I was pleasantly engrossed in this heartfelt tale.Mr. Magorium is a very old inventor (several centuries) who has not only helped a few famous souls out there but has managed to create a magical toy store. However, he feels it is time to pass from this world. It seems to be pretty much his decision and he seems perfectly fine with it, and I found that to be an interesting look at death.However, the store's manager Molly is a young woman who still hasn't quite figured out her place in the world. It's pretty shocking to her to learn that her beloved boss plans to die and leave her in charge when she has no idea who she is and only has a hat-collecting boy with no friends his own age and a workaholic accountant as her only companions.Mr. Magorium is positive she'll do fine, with a little encouragement, and thus pours out a sweet story about finding the best in yourself.It wasn't what I expected, and that's not a bad thing, especially when I realized the plot was deeper than a toy store romp.I don't think the characters other than Mr. Magorium were as realized as they could have been, but they were still a far cry from two-dimensional bimbos and it did leave room for some proper growth.Overall, I was pleasantly surprised at the story's charming simplicity and message.

I generally don't mind ""bittersweet"" movies, but this one just drug me too far down that even the joyful ending couldn't erase the sad feeling from earlier in the film. Mahoney's distress was just too real!The second reason is the manner in which Magorium dies. I love that the movie somewhat ""demystifies"" death, reinforcing that a life well lived is not a cause for sadness but of celebration and honor. But the fact that they made his death so ordinarily human with the funeral and everyone lined up at his graveside dressed in black, really disappointed me. I was so hoping as they showed his feet on the night he ""departed"" that somehow they would just disappear as a fitting end to his magical life. Instead I was left with the terrible question, ""What did he do to himself?"" and ""Who found his body?"" etc. I am relatively certain that kids over a certain age are savvy enough to ask the same questions. And the way the movie portrays it, I don't think there are satisfactory answers.This portrayal of death with the questions it raises take away from the main message of the movie that, ""Your life is an occasion... rise to it,"" and that we do that by believing in ourselves and by faith in the seemingly impossible. ""Wonder Emporium"" is a beautifully crafted movie with only this one dark spot in my mind.This is the kind of movie that seems like it must have been a well-loved book first with it's classic kid-lit characters... what a joy to find that there are people in Hollywood with the talent and imagination to create a story like this in present times!

The story of Mr. Magorium is partly one of the archetypal American legend who inspired a generation to carry on dreaming. It is significant that Kermit makes an appearance in the film as Jim Henson was one such figure who may well, have inspired the films philosophy. Few men of his generation were so influential to the children of the world and these men like Magorium set an example not by what they said so much but by what they did with their lives. Inspiration reverberates for generations and the wisdom which comes from that inspiration will hopefully always lead us towards the lights until ultimately we have a legacy like Magorium's to pass on. This idea of finding faith in past childhood wisdom in order to regain direction in ones life is largely the journey Molly Mahoney must grasp in the film until she understands the strength of her perception and how she can do some good in this world.This film was an unexpected highlight over the holiday period.

My six year old sat enthralled through most of it given the emporium full of wonderful toys that Mr. Magorium had.  Unfortunately, for adults this is a dull, plodding movie that will test your patience throughout.  I expected much more from Hoffman and Portman, but they can only deliver on what has been handed them, and in this case it was more props than it was story, as Zach Helm made Mr. Magorium into a 243-year-old Mr. Gadget who no longer had any tricks up his sleeves and had decided to sign out.  The reason, as Mr. Magorium explains, is that he has come to the end of his last pair of Tuscan leather shoes and there is nowhere else to find them.  The film's fixation on death is a bit strange given that it seems aimed mostly at elementary age kids.  Sadly, the main characters are all such loners that they have a very hard time letting Mr. Magorium go, so we get endless attempts to forestall the event and a store that goes into a deep gray funk over the matter.  What little humor there is in the movie is parsed out in little cubes of sugar, seeming forced and contrite.  They could have at least found the toymaker extraordinaire an old shoe shop in New York that could fix his dilapidated shoes.  Poor Molly seems to have the hardest time, staring at a block of wood Mr. Magorium gave her, unable to unlock its magic power until the end, when everything is restored to glowing technicolor as it should be.

While there is a lot to recommend this movie to children, there isn't much here for adults.  When it came to it, I was reminded of Nanny McPhee versus Mary Poppins.  Nanny McPhee was a fun little movie, but it just didn't have the ""magic"" that Poppins had, and neither does Magorium match up to the wonder of Willy Wonka.  That said, it was an entertaining movie overall and I'm glad I saw it, but just as glad I didn't buy the DVD.Mr. Magorium has decided it is time to depart, and wants an accountant to tell him the value of his store before he leaves it to his assistant, Mahoney.  The accountant, of course, manages to miss all the magic that happens in the store.  And the film wastes no time throwing the audience into the bright colors and wackiness that a living toy store, imbued with the spirit of children, must have.  There is a huge book out of which toys magically appear, a door that has a special dial to change what's on the other side, a room with the biggest dodge ball on earth - no one can dodge it! - a shelf full of stuffed toys literally reaching out to the people passing by (including one adorable sock monkey), and through it all Dustin Hoffman smiles benevolently upon the children.  Hoffman plays the part a little too over the top, but still manages to retain his charm.  But, there is no plot beyond this simple premise.  Mahoney is distraught when she learns Magorium's leaving and the store itself throws a temper tantrum.  Yet, there is an uplifting message behind it all that made this movie worth seeing.Mahoney believes in the magic of the store, whole-heartedly.  Yet, she doesn't truly believe in herself.  The accountant gets befriended by a boy who collects hats, and together they must convince her she does have the magic to keep the store going.  This is a great film for younger children that are ready to move past animated films.  The CGI and special effects are pretty good, and the characters are all likeable.

1136132,A2XQMGE2YY88DC,B00128VA6C,Jiang Xueqin,"[2, 3]","The children's movie ""Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium"" is highly manipulative and highly effective film-making. Mr. Magorium (Dustin Hoffman) is a toystore wizard whose decided that it's time for him to depart from this world not because 243 years is a long time to live but because he's run out of his favorite shoes. Molly Mahoney (Natalie Portman) is his apprentice who once as a piano prodigy tried to compose a master concerto but now as Mr. Magorium's heir apparent must figure out what to do with a block of wood. To help her Mr. Magorium has hired an accountant or ""a counting mutant"" (Jason Bateman), who as a humorless workaholic represents all that's wrong with the adult world, and so kids instinctively like to step on him. Serving as the narrator and the conscience of the movie is nine-year old Eric.With Mr. Magorium as the composer the wonder emporium is simply a visual symphony, with shiny fire engines popping out of dusty books and Lego construction workers causing fire hazards. Everything is so cute and cuddly, as are the characters. Dustin Hoffman is very good, Jason Bateman is his usual likable self even when he's playing the movie's antagonist, and Natalie Portman manages to yet again demonstrate the full range of her acting talents even in a movie as emotionally one-sided as this one. This is a feel-good movie, and even the supposedly weird narrator Eric is weird only because he has the wisdom of someone who has lived three centuries.And as a feel-good movie it slides into conflict and climax without really doing so. Mr. Magorium's last day is one big holiday, his depature is treated as a non-event, and Molly Mahoney's ""rise to the occasion"" is so assured that we have to credit the movie with even pretending anything else was possible.Yes, this movie may be predictable and plotless but it raises an interesting point about how children and the elderly benefit society. Modern economics views children and the elderly as ""dependents,"" meaning they use important resources without helping to create wealth. Economists have long known that a population with a large proportion of working adults relative to dependents (Ireland, China, and soon India) benefit from fast and tremendous growth; the converse is also true, and so it's easy and quick to believe that the less children and elderly there are the better.""Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium"" suggests these so-called dependents have an instrinsic and priceless social value: in them lies humanity's collected wisdom that adults have too easily forgotten. The counting mutant never believed in the magic of faith to change one's world, and Molly Mahoney had forgotten to believe but Eric always believed, and he believed with such a stubborn passion that he, not Molly Mahoney, is Mr. Magorium's true heir apparent. Eric is the only one who understands the counting mutant is really a child at heart, that it is time for Mr. Magorium to leave, and that Molly Mahoney is the only one who can inherit the store. The adults must struggle to discover truths that come instinctively to Eric.That's because this is a children's movie, and Eric is the true hero and protagonist. More than conversing with the Molly Mahoneys and the counting mutants of this world (who as caricatures don't really exist) this movie is telling the the lonely and underappreciated Erics of this world that everyday because they see color in a world of gray and have faith in an overly rational world they help blind adults see.But is this really true?

And when I say magical, I do mean magical. The toys come alive and play with the kids. There is even a door of rooms controlled by a dial to find the room you want.Molly Mahoney (Natalie Portman) is the store manager, a former piano virtuoso ready to get back to her music career.  Mr. Magorium doesn't pay any attention to her, however, but brings in a mutant.  Okays, so it's really an accountant, but he figures the word derived from mutant at some point.  Henry Weston (Jason Bateman) is hired to find out just how much the store is worth.  See, Mr. Magorium has not kept records at all.  Fortunately, he has saved every receipt along the way.Yet it's Eric Applebaum (Zach Mills), a nine year old hat collector with no friends, who first notices the problem. A wall of the store is turning dark and bubbling. Could Mr. Magorium's decision to leave be causing the problem? Will the store react poorly if he follows through?This movie was marketed as a fun comedy fantasy.  From those ads, I was really looking forward to seeing it.  Unfortunately, the movie is much more serious then I was led to believe it would be.  While the theme of believing in yourself is wonderful, the melancholy tone made parts of it sadder then I was looking for.Despite the disappointment in tone, there is much to praise.  There were several funny sight gags and great lines.  Most of these were in the previews, however.  This accountant got a huge kick out of the characters continually calling Henry ""Mutant.""  And don't miss Kermit the Frog's wonderful cameo.  This movie wasn't the special effects extravaganza I was expecting, but what was there was great.  And the acting was top notch.  All four of the leads made their characters absolutely believable.  Special praise has to go to Dustin Hoffman as Mr. Magorium.  He made the movie work.I think if I had walked into this film knowing what to expect, I would have enjoyed it.  But since the movie wasn't what I wanted, I couldn't help but feel disappointed.

Magorium is getting old, he is 243 years old and senses that his apprentice is stuck so he dies to push her along. Molly Mahoney doesn't feel she has the skills or sense to run a magical toy store, yet she knows it is magical, as she tells the accountant Henry, who is even more mundane and buttoned up. It is a learns-better story, an opening up to active magic, finding a connection. But old wizard Magorium has to die to teach  Molly and Henry what is magic. A sense of wonder, but a sweet children's story. Not quite Mary Poppins but still a better story than expected. If I had been 5 years old at the time I would have been overwhelmed with joy at it. Nowadays I don't got so enthralled with a fantasy movie unless it is slightly more adult in nature (for example, Stardust, Monkeybone, Who Framed Roger Rabbit). This film has a magnificent and very impressive set of thousands and thousands of toys---all alive. There is a symbiotic connection between the store and Mr. Magorium (who resembles Merlin in many ways). When Magorium dies the store goes deep into depression, when it feels Magorium is going to go away it has a temper tantrum.The cast choice is a surprise. Why Dustin Hoffman? And Natalie Portman? I don't think they were right for the parts. Definitely a film for small children. It has parallels with Miracle on 34th Street-- in which skeptics develop a sense of the magical in a subtle way.

They did a very good job of portraying a whimsical magical toy store full of neat things that come alive.  When the toy store was content, it was quite colorful and enjoyable to behold.

It also had a temper tantrum and went from an orderly organized toy store to a disorganized messy chaotic toy store.  You see, the toy store had a personality too, and it was upset that Mr. Magorium (played by Dustin Hoffman) was leaving.  He was leaving the store to Molly Mahoney (played by Natalie Portman), but she didn't want the store at first.  She thought that only Mr. Magorium could effectively run the store because he was full of magic.

Her utterly wooden appearance in those 3 movies were an affront to acting.  But after seeing Closer and this movie, I now blame George Lucas for her acting in the Star Wars movies.  This is probably the biggest name movie since Star Wars in which Portman is the lead actress, and she pulls it of quite well.  The premise of the movie is quite simple, a very old man owns a magical toy shop whose clerk is a young lady played by Portman.  Said owner, Mr. Magorium, feels his death approaching and decides to hand the store over to his lady clerk.  The store and her disagree, and trouble ensues.  Of course, being a children's movie, the ending is happy, if not somewhat predictable.

1136158,AXV9GS0TMSVW,B00128VA6C,Poor Napoleon,"[4, 4]","""Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium"" is a great and albeit odd family film.  It's odd in the sense that many alleged family films of late have been sprinkled with hints of vulgarity and innuendo.  So ""Magorium"" is great in the sense that there's none of that here.  This is an innocent family film that is fun and entertaining, even if its story seems on the sophmoric side.  The film's spirit makes up for it by leaps and bounds.The story centers on Mahoney, played by Natalie Portman, who manages the store, but is an aspiring piano player who sees herself leaving the store soon.  She is friends with Eric, a boy who comes to the store but has no friends his own age.  Magorium, played with cartoon like precision by Dustin Hoffman, is looking to leave the store to Mahoney.  In the meantime, the store seems to be losing some of it's magic.Part of the charm of this film is that it is pure fun.  The actors (especially Hoffman) look like they're having a good time and the pure magic of the toy store celebrates children and their imagination.  Coming from a child development background, I especially grinned at one of the lines where Mahoney remarks to a child that they don't have to stay in the lines when they color.  The effects and look of the store are neat.  While there are neat visual effects, a lot of the store's charm comes from creative use of sets and puppetry and, oh, a couple live animals here and there.The film falters a bit in the story department.  It's an okay story.  Like many children's features though, it's short.  The conclusion seems rather rushed by the end of the film's 90 minute running time and I felt something was missing from the script. Some of the film's humor is spot on, while some of it rests on tired puns.  When that happens, we are at ease because of the performers' ability to deliver.Overall, this is a fun family film.  It's a real shame that it did not do well in theatres as the film captures innocence and imagination better than a lot of recent family films.  Parents can rest assured that this film lives up to its G rating.  The film is cute and non threatening, and while the story may not break any ground in family entertainment, this is still a film that families can sit down and enjoy without worry.",4,"Magorium celbrates imagination, innocence",1204588800,"03 4, 2008",2008,2261,"['Mr.', 'Magorium', 'Wonder', 'Emporium', 'great', 'albeit', 'odd', 'family', 'film', 'odd', 'sense', 'many', 'alleged', 'family', 'films', 'late', 'have', 'been', 'sprinkled', 'hints', 'vulgarity', 'innuendo', 'Magorium', 'great', 'sense', 'none', 'here', 'innocent', 'family', 'film', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'even', 'story', 'sophmoric', 'side', 'film', 'spirit', 'up', 'leaps', 'bounds.The', 'story', 'centers', 'Mahoney', 'played', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'who', 'store', 'aspiring', 'piano', 'player', 'who', 'leaving', 'store', 'soon', 'friends', 'Eric', 'boy', 'who', 'store', 'friends', 'own', 'age', 'Magorium', 'played', 'cartoon', 'precision', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'looking', 'leave', 'store', 'Mahoney', 'meantime', 'store', 'be', 'losing', 'magic.Part', 'charm', 'film', 'pure', 'fun', 'actors', 'especially', 'Hoffman', 'look', ""'re"", 'having', 'good', 'time', 'pure', 'magic', 'toy', 'store', 'children', 'imagination', 'Coming', 'child', 'development', 'background', 'especially', 'grinned', 'one', 'lines', 'where', 'Mahoney', 'remarks', 'child', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'stay', 'lines', 'when', 'color', 'effects', 'look', 'store', 'are', 'neat', 'are', 'neat', 'visual', 'effects', 'lot', 'store', 'charm', 'creative', 'use', 'sets', 'puppetry', 'oh', 'couple', 'live', 'animals', 'here', 'there.The', 'film', 'falters', 'bit', 'story', 'department', 'okay', 'story', 'many', 'children', 'features', 'short', 'conclusion', 'rather', 'rushed', 'end', 'film', '90', 'minute', 'running', 'time', 'felt', 'something', 'was', 'missing', 'script', 'film', 'humor', 'spot', 'tired', 'puns', 'When', 'are', 'ease', 'performers', 'ability', 'deliver.Overall', 'fun', 'family', 'film', 'real', 'shame', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'well', 'theatres', 'film', 'innocence', 'imagination', 'better', 'lot', 'recent', 'family', 'films', 'Parents', 'can', 'rest', 'assured', 'film', 'up', 'G', 'rating', 'film', 'cute', 'non', 'threatening', 'story', 'may', 'not', 'break', 'ground', 'family', 'entertainment', 'still', 'film', 'families', 'can', 'sit', 'down', 'enjoy', 'worry']",Mr. Magorium's: Wonder Emporium

You see, Mr. Magorium (Dustin Hoffman), the 243 year old proprieter has just run out of his last pair of shoes that he'd selected to 'last the rest of his life' and he's going to move on. (Note--he didn't say 'die' batteries do that)Eric Applebaum (Zach Mills) is a young boy who collects hats, but only made one friend at summer camp.  ""Jeff"" turned out to be a squirrel.

Mahoney is just marking time at Magorium's--she was a musical prodigy, but at 23 feels washed up because she can't get her music quite right. She's surprised when the boss calls in an accountant--they've never had one.

It's ""just a""--toy store, car, etc.  No magic in him.When Magorium does move on, it's up to the three of them to ressucitate a place that's lost all the color in it.  It takes a wooden cube and a whole lot of belief to make that happen.I'll certainly buy this DVD when it becomes available and see it periodically, because it is a geniune 'feel good' movie without drowning you in excess sucrosity.

Granted, it is formulaic, but in a way that's not tedious.Mr. Magorium (Hoffman), who reminded me a little of Ed Wynn's Uncle Albert in ""Mary Poppins,"" owns a living, magical store full of colorful, magical toys that children love.  He's never kept tabs on profit or loss, has items and signatures from people who lived up to hundreds of years ago, and is now about to ""leave.""  He wishes to pass the store on to Mahoney (Portman), much to her dismay.  She sees  herself as a failure in her chosen field and entirely unsuited to run a magic store.  And, because she loves Mr. Magorium (who is also ""Not Steve""), is heartbroken at the same time.  The child-like Magorium will not be swayed from his appointed hour, however.To further the crisis, the store itself throws a temper tantrum at Magorium's planned exit and loses all of its color and magic after his death.  Mahoney, with accountant Henry (nicknamed ""Mutant,"" which I found funny all movie long) and store gofer Eric, must set about restoring things after a mandatory crisis of faith.  She wants to sell the store, sort of.It is the dry and dusty accountant who finally sees the light, that the store must not be sold off, and helps Mahoney to realize her destiny with the help of a magical block of wood.  Of course the beauty and magic of the store and its furnishings are restored.Will Mahoney also live 243 years, and somehow keep that quaint old building (sandwiched between skyscrapers) intact, open, and safe from modern government regulations?  Who knows?  But forget the newspaper review if it was like the one I read.

1136175,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B00128VA6C,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[1, 1]","For a film focusing heavily on believing in magic, Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium is surprisingly devoid of the magic of moviemaking. Several clich&eacute; characters and a story missing any real conflict produces a whimsically dreary tale best reserved for the young at heart and absent of mind. While its target audience will likely find plenty to enjoy in the Emporium, fans of Hoffman and Portman will want to wait for more meaningful ventures.Narrated by young Eric (Zach Mills) and told like a storybook complete with chapters, Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium tells the tale of exactly that. The eccentric 243-year-old toy aficionado (Dustin Hoffman) runs a magical toy store with little care in the world. But when he decides it's time to depart from this life and wills the store to Molly Mahoney (Natalie Portman), the Emporium's manager and only other employee (save for the strange circus reject living in the basement), she questions her ability to handle such promotion and determines to make Magorium realize all the fun he would be leaving behind. Meanwhile, Magorium has hired Henry (Jason Bateman) to sort out the mess of receipts and legal requirements of running a business, and it's up to Eric (and a mystical wooden cube) to show both the stuffy accountant and the insecure Molly the magic of believing in yourself.Deceptively opening with Pixar-esque cutout animation during its credits, such frills are the only thing Magorium has in common with the ever-entertaining computer animated films. Stocked with unremarkable characters, the situations they are confronted with range from death to disbelief, though rarely do we feel attached enough to care. The conflicts never feel immediate and the solutions don't stay grounded in reality. Perhaps the most pressing predicament is a saddened, personified toy store quickly losing its color, or a mopey sock monkey without someone to hold.Magorium has an impressive cast in likely their least impressive performances. Dustin Hoffman as the gray-haired, bushy-eyebrowed title character grates on the nerves rather quickly with his too-cheerful quips and contrived speech impediment. If Willy Wonka wasn't cool, and owned a toy store instead of a chocolate factory, he'd be Mr. Magorium. Natalie Portman is believable as a cheery toy store manager, and even as a piano prodigy, but rarely does she evoke any emotions from her audience other than regret for not watching her other, better roles. Jason Bateman fits as the workaholic accountant who needs to believe in magic for others to believe in themselves, but too little focus is placed on his character development. He's not an antagonist and no one needs to work all that hard to make a believer out of him. In fact, there is no villain in this film at all, unless the sandman's gritty fingers reaching for your eyelids counts.While rather languid in the story department, the effects and set designers likely had a field day with the living Emporium, piled high with all manner of games and toys. Animated mobiles, graying walls, and a monstrous dodgeball highlight the special effects, and what wasn't computer generated appeared painstakingly crafted. The dial that changes the rooms of the store also added to the creative feats, though its too bad Miyazaki showcased the concept in Howl's Moving Castle several years earlier.If one tried very hard they might be able to sink into the magical world of Mr. Magorium and his living toy store, and at times might even realize the important lessons on display, from believing in yourself to the value of friendship. But flying wooden cubes and sad sock puppets mixed with Shakespearean quotes and misbehaved zebras will probably make you forget about such trivial morals.- Joel Massie",2,Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium Review,1196208000,"11 28, 2007",2007,3756,"['film', 'focusing', 'heavily', 'believing', 'magic', 'Mr.', 'Magorium', 'Wonder', 'Emporium', 'surprisingly', 'devoid', 'magic', 'moviemaking', 'Several', 'clich', 'eacute', 'characters', 'story', 'missing', 'real', 'conflict', 'whimsically', 'dreary', 'tale', 'best', 'reserved', 'young', 'heart', 'absent', 'mind', 'target', 'audience', 'will', 'likely', 'find', 'plenty', 'enjoy', 'Emporium', 'fans', 'Hoffman', 'Portman', 'will', 'want', 'wait', 'more', 'meaningful', 'ventures.Narrated', 'young', 'Eric', 'Zach', 'Mills', 'told', 'storybook', 'complete', 'chapters', 'Mr.', 'Magorium', 'Wonder', 'Emporium', 'tale', 'exactly', 'eccentric', '243-year-old', 'toy', 'aficionado', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'magical', 'toy', 'store', 'little', 'care', 'world', 'when', 'time', 'depart', 'life', 'store', 'Molly', 'Mahoney', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'Emporium', 'manager', 'only', 'other', 'employee', 'save', 'strange', 'circus', 'reject', 'living', 'basement', 'questions', 'ability', 'handle', 'such', 'promotion', 'determines', 'make', 'Magorium', 'realize', 'fun', 'would', 'be', 'leaving', 'Meanwhile', 'Magorium', 'hired', 'Henry', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'sort', 'out', 'mess', 'receipts', 'legal', 'requirements', 'running', 'business', 'up', 'Eric', 'mystical', 'wooden', 'cube', 'show', 'stuffy', 'accountant', 'insecure', 'Molly', 'magic', 'believing', 'yourself.Deceptively', 'opening', 'Pixar-esque', 'cutout', 'animation', 'credits', 'such', 'frills', 'are', 'only', 'thing', 'Magorium', 'common', 'ever-entertaining', 'computer', 'animated', 'films', 'Stocked', 'unremarkable', 'characters', 'situations', 'are', 'confronted', 'range', 'death', 'disbelief', 'rarely', 'do', 'feel', 'attached', 'enough', 'care', 'conflicts', 'never', 'feel', 'immediate', 'solutions', 'do', ""n't"", 'stay', 'grounded', 'reality', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'pressing', 'predicament', 'saddened', 'personified', 'toy', 'store', 'quickly', 'losing', 'color', 'mopey', 'sock', 'monkey', 'someone', 'hold.Magorium', 'impressive', 'cast', 'likely', 'least', 'impressive', 'performances', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'gray-haired', 'bushy-eyebrowed', 'title', 'character', 'grates', 'nerves', 'rather', 'quickly', 'too-cheerful', 'quips', 'contrived', 'speech', 'impediment', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'was', ""n't"", 'cool', 'owned', 'toy', 'store', 'instead', 'chocolate', 'factory', ""'d"", 'be', 'Mr.', 'Magorium', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'believable', 'cheery', 'toy', 'store', 'manager', 'even', 'piano', 'prodigy', 'rarely', 'evoke', 'emotions', 'audience', 'other', 'regret', 'not', 'watching', 'other', 'better', 'roles', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'workaholic', 'accountant', 'who', 'believe', 'magic', 'others', 'believe', 'too', 'little', 'focus', 'placed', 'character', 'development', 'not', 'antagonist', 'one', 'work', 'hard', 'make', 'believer', 'fact', 'villain', 'film', 'sandman', 'gritty', 'fingers', 'reaching', 'eyelids', 'counts.While', 'rather', 'languid', 'story', 'department', 'effects', 'set', 'designers', 'likely', 'had', 'field', 'day', 'living', 'Emporium', 'piled', 'high', 'manner', 'games', 'toys', 'Animated', 'mobiles', 'graying', 'walls', 'monstrous', 'dodgeball', 'highlight', 'special', 'effects', 'what', 'was', ""n't"", 'computer', 'generated', 'appeared', 'painstakingly', 'crafted', 'dial', 'rooms', 'store', 'also', 'added', 'creative', 'feats', 'too', 'bad', 'Miyazaki', 'showcased', 'concept', 'Howl', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'several', 'years', 'earlier.If', 'one', 'tried', 'very', 'hard', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'sink', 'magical', 'world', 'Mr.', 'Magorium', 'living', 'toy', 'store', 'times', 'might', 'even', 'realize', 'important', 'lessons', 'display', 'believing', 'value', 'friendship', 'flying', 'wooden', 'cubes', 'sad', 'sock', 'puppets', 'mixed', 'Shakespearean', 'quotes', 'misbehaved', 'zebras', 'will', 'probably', 'make', 'forget', 'such', 'trivial', 'morals.-', 'Joel', 'Massie']",Mr. Magorium's: Wonder Emporium

Like Wonka, Mr. Magorium (Hoffman) is a playful eccentric with wild hair, and a penchant for bizarre behavior.  His old world story is nestled between high rise building and it's no wonder as he has owned the store for over 200 years.  Toys virtually come to life inside the store, playing with the customers as much as they play with the.  The store has an inter-dimensional quality to it as a certain door can lead to different rooms with the turn of a dial on the wall.  The large, dusty store catalog can materialize its toys from thin air just by turning its pages.Molly Mahoney (Portman) is the store manager and we learn immediately that while she loves working there, she feels incomplete for having never pursued her dream to be a concert pianist.  This is underscored when a former college classmate comments that he didn't know that she was still working at the store.  For shy 9-year-old Eric, the store is a sanctuary as he has no friends his age.  Because Mr. Magorium has never kept book or paid taxes (sure, like the IRS would let him get away with that for 200 years!) he hires accountant Henry Weston (Bateman) to get the books in order.Magorium startles Molly by announcing that his time in the world is up and he intends to leave the store to her.  Molly refuses to believe that's he's going to die and turns down the offer.  This causes the store to lose all its magic.  Its bright red walls turn black and the toys are now lifeless.  Henry and Eric have to convince Molly that she has to take over the store in order to save it.Again, the parallels with Wonka are many, even down to the owner needing to find someone younger to take over.  However, while Wonka was laced with often biting commentary about the behavior of spoiled kids and their parents, Magorium has none of this conflict.  Henry's unresolved issues about having friends his age remain unresolved.  Molly's dreams of becoming a pianist are tossed aside.  Only Henry gets to grow, realizing that he cannot be all work and no play.The film does have some nice special effects that bring the wonder and magic of the store alive but there's not much magic in the predictable and unsatisfying script.  It's riddled with clich&eacute;s which try to force the viewer into knowing when to laugh and cry and be overjoyed.  On the plus side it's a film most kids, especially younger kids will adore and it is good, clean family entertainment.ExtrasThe DVD does come with several featurettes:Strangely Weird and Weirdly Strange:  The Magical World Of A Wonder EmporiumAn Eccentric Boss And An Awkward ApprenticeTo Meet Eric Applebaum, Start By Saying HiThe Magical Toy Store Featurette",3,LACKS THE MAGIC OF WONKA,1214179200,"06 23, 2008",2008,2794,"['Take', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'chocolate', 'factory', 'put', 'toy', 'story', 'essentially', 'have', 'Mr.', 'Magorium', 'Wonder', 'Emporium', 'Wonka', 'Mr.', 'Magorium', 'Hoffman', 'playful', 'eccentric', 'wild', 'hair', 'penchant', 'bizarre', 'behavior', 'old', 'world', 'story', 'nestled', 'high', 'rise', 'building', 'wonder', 'owned', 'store', '200', 'years', 'Toys', 'virtually', 'come', 'life', 'store', 'playing', 'customers', 'as', 'much', 'play', 'store', 'inter-dimensional', 'quality', 'certain', 'door', 'can', 'lead', 'different', 'rooms', 'turn', 'dial', 'wall', 'large', 'dusty', 'store', 'catalog', 'can', 'materialize', 'toys', 'thin', 'air', 'just', 'turning', 'pages.Molly', 'Mahoney', 'Portman', 'store', 'manager', 'learn', 'immediately', 'working', 'there', 'incomplete', 'having', 'never', 'pursued', 'dream', 'be', 'concert', 'pianist', 'underscored', 'when', 'former', 'college', 'classmate', 'comments', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'still', 'working', 'store', 'shy', '9-year-old', 'Eric', 'store', 'sanctuary', 'friends', 'age', 'Mr.', 'Magorium', 'never', 'kept', 'book', 'paid', 'taxes', 'sure', 'IRS', 'would', 'let', 'get', 'away', '200', 'years', 'accountant', 'Henry', 'Weston', 'Bateman', 'get', 'books', 'order.Magorium', 'startles', 'Molly', 'announcing', 'time', 'world', 'up', 'leave', 'store', 'Molly', 'believe', 'going', 'die', 'turns', 'down', 'offer', 'store', 'lose', 'magic', 'bright', 'red', 'walls', 'turn', 'black', 'toys', 'are', 'now', 'lifeless', 'Henry', 'Eric', 'have', 'convince', 'Molly', 'take', 'over', 'store', 'order', 'save', 'it.Again', 'parallels', 'Wonka', 'are', 'many', 'even', 'down', 'owner', 'needing', 'find', 'someone', 'younger', 'take', 'over', 'However', 'Wonka', 'was', 'laced', 'often', 'biting', 'commentary', 'behavior', 'spoiled', 'kids', 'parents', 'Magorium', 'none', 'conflict', 'Henry', 'unresolved', 'issues', 'having', 'friends', 'age', 'remain', 'unresolved', 'Molly', 'dreams', 'becoming', 'pianist', 'are', 'tossed', 'aside', 'Only', 'Henry', 'grow', 'realizing', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'work', 'play.The', 'film', 'have', 'nice', 'special', 'effects', 'bring', 'wonder', 'magic', 'store', 'alive', 'not', 'much', 'magic', 'predictable', 'unsatisfying', 'script', 'riddled', 'clich', 'eacute', 'try', 'force', 'viewer', 'knowing', 'when', 'laugh', 'cry', 'be', 'overjoyed', 'plus', 'side', 'film', 'most', 'kids', 'especially', 'younger', 'kids', 'will', 'adore', 'good', 'clean', 'family', 'entertainment.ExtrasThe', 'DVD', 'come', 'several', 'featurettes', 'Strangely', 'Weird', 'Weirdly', 'Strange', 'Magical', 'World', 'A', 'Wonder', 'EmporiumAn', 'Eccentric', 'Boss', 'Awkward', 'ApprenticeTo', 'Meet', 'Eric', 'Applebaum', 'Start', 'Saying', 'HiThe', 'Magical', 'Toy', 'Store', 'Featurette']",Mr. Magorium's: Wonder Emporium

Mr Magorium is that, and more. It is, at its' core, a modern day parable that speaks to the power and magic of faith.On the surface, Mr Magorium's Wonder Emporioum is a toy store for the ages. The children come into play in brightly lit corners stacked high with toys, games, books, and models. Rockets fly around the ceiling. A magical ball room transforms itself into an upstairs suite with the twist of a knob. The life of the store is reflected in the joy of the children and parents who enter the doors.Mr Edward Magorium is dying. 243 years old, and his shoes are finally wearing out. As he explains to his assistant, Molly Mahoney, his last pair of shoes is wearing out and he knows that when they do, he will die. To prepare for the event, he hires an accountant, Henry Weston, to evaluate the value of the store and the contents. Magorium, names him Mutant, and throughout the whole film, Henry discovers the oddities that define a 200 year old man. $300,000 for a door knob (I've never paid more than $250,000). An IOU from the Thomas Edison. Century old toys. And a book keeping system that defies logic and belief. It's almost too much for a trained Mutant to bear!Like a living being, the toy store ebbs and moves.  Cracks appear on the walls.  The life within the toys wanes and the atmosphere is less magical.  A young assistant, Eric Applebaum,On the passing of Mr Magorium, the store 'dies' as well. But not before he presents a gift to Molly of a large block presumably possessing magical powers.  Unable to sustain the life of the store and business flow, Molly closes and prepares to sell much to the disappointment of Eric Applebaum, the young hat collector who works at the store.When all is darkest, and Molly's dream of finishing her grand masterpiece, she discovers the missing piece to the puzzle.  When all is dark, and she is about to sign the store over, she discovers the magic behind the emporium.""Move"" ""Move"" ""Fly...."" is all that is required when her journey to joy takes flight as her faith is renewed and the toy store explodes!  In one broad stroke, he symphony is complete, and the deadened toy store comes to life once more.I said before this is a modern day parable, and I believe it is.  Beneath the toys lies the truth of the mustard seed. ""If I have faith as a mustard seed, I could say to the mountain, move, and it shall MOVE!""  And it does.There are other themes too.  Joy in the journey.  Youth.  Living life to its' fullest.  Passing on of our faith.  Mourning.Dustin Hoffman and Natalie Portman are wonderfully cast in this film.  The `mutant', Justin Bateman, plays a perfect straight man.This is a true family film that is not fluff.  Talk about it. Watch it together.  Share it.
