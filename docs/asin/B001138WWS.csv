I would highly recommend this movie IF you want to watch something so terrible that it borders on greatness!  The Rock is more convincing as an actor than anybody in this cast of whose-nots; the special effects would have been special twenty years ago - now, they only add to the ridiculousness of the movie.  The story itself was so ill-conceived that it makes the American Pie movies seem like the Godfather by comparison.

I can deal with cheese, but this was just one of those movies that make you wonder how it got financed, completed, and released. Most movies that the Sci Fi Channel does are better than this and that's saying a great deal. The story line had potential, but everything else just causes it to flat line.Movies of this type that were done better? Army of Darkness (plenty of cheesy fun) or any of the Mummy movies. Other reviewers seem to like it which makes me wonder if they were involved with the film somehow.

1129326,A31JB6CYMPB3RB,B001138WWS,Shaun G Rodriguez,"[1, 1]","""Army of the Dead"" is not a gory violent movie, like most horror movies today. It does have it's charm but is a watered down version of ""Army of Darkness"". This is probably a attempt to make ""Army of Darkness"" with a modern twist. I still think ""Army of Darkness"" is way better and the effects are almost the same. This is your typical B-horror movie without the gore. I would watch this movie again and it holds down an interesting concept. The skeleton army is pretty cool for a low budget film. I didn't mind the bad acting, because all B-movies have bad acting. If you have kids who are in there early teens this is a great movie for you. There is no nudity, I can't recall any profanity, and there is little to no gore. So if you like horror movies that you can watch with your teenage kids this is a rare movie for you. I thought it was an ok movie that is rare in the horror genre. If you are a gore fan stay away you will find this movie cheesy and boring.
