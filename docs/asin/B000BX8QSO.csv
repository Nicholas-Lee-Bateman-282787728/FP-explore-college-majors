952212,AWDIIREVRB6BI,B000BX8QSO,"Collector ""fan""","[2, 2]","Hare and Guu doesn't seem like the type of anime that mature anime fans would want to watch. But actually this is one show that can be enjoyed by fans of all ages. The story revolves around Hare and a strange pale girl named Guu. Guu shows up unexpectedly in Hare's life and throws it into a whole lot of confusion. Guu is one of the funniest, strangest characters I have ever seen in an anime. Her origins are a complete mystery. Who is she? Where is she from? WHAT is she? All questions you will keep asking yourself while you watch the show. You'll have to keep watching to find out if your questions are answered or not. The first volume starts out good enough. It introduces you to the main characters, and sets up character dynamics that will last through the series. The animation is very simple and colored brightly to reflect the vibrant jungle setting. Underneath the cutesy, colorful exterior there are some adult issues that are dealt with also. In the first volume, there are hints of the real hilarity that is yet to come. Stick around and find out how crazy and funny this anime gets. I promise you it'll be lots of fun!",4,Good Start...gets better.....,1143417600,"03 27, 2006",2006,1135,"['Hare', 'Guu', ""n't"", 'seem', 'type', 'anime', 'mature', 'anime', 'fans', 'would', 'want', 'watch', 'actually', 'one', 'show', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'fans', 'ages', 'story', 'Hare', 'strange', 'pale', 'girl', 'named', 'Guu', 'Guu', 'up', 'unexpectedly', 'Hare', 'life', 'whole', 'lot', 'confusion', 'Guu', 'one', 'funniest', 'strangest', 'characters', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'anime', 'origins', 'are', 'complete', 'mystery', 'Who', 'Where', 'WHAT', 'questions', 'will', 'keep', 'asking', 'watch', 'show', ""'ll"", 'have', 'keep', 'watching', 'find', 'out', 'questions', 'are', 'answered', 'not', 'first', 'volume', 'out', 'good', 'enough', 'main', 'characters', 'up', 'character', 'dynamics', 'will', 'last', 'series', 'animation', 'very', 'simple', 'colored', 'brightly', 'reflect', 'vibrant', 'jungle', 'setting', 'cutesy', 'colorful', 'exterior', 'are', 'adult', 'issues', 'are', 'dealt', 'also', 'first', 'volume', 'are', 'hints', 'real', 'hilarity', 'yet', 'come', 'Stick', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'crazy', 'funny', 'anime', 'promise', ""'ll"", 'be', 'lots', 'fun']",N/A
952213,A39LRLKACX89IP,B000BX8QSO,Courtland J. Carpenter,"[10, 13]","It's amazing the number of reviewers that will give a bad product a good review.  I always wondered, especially when it comes to books, film, music, and other media what they saw in it.  I had seen some good reviews of an anime called: Super Milk Chan, and when it played on Toonami, I expected something watch able.  How anyone can call that kind of thing entertaining is beyond me!!I was half expecting to be disappointed when I got hold of some fansubs of this series.  Commonly known just as Jungle Wa, I guess because it take place there most of the series, I was expecting a lot of dumb antics and no storyline.  The guy that gave me the DVD described this as Tex Avery characters on ""crack"".  Now Tex Avery was known for doing zany, hyper characters like, Daffy, Bugs, Porky and others, so I got that this may be a bit over the top as an anime.  From the start of the entry music, and jungle animation, I started to believe.  At least it seemed more fun thus far than Milk Chan!The plot centers around a character named Hare, called Hale or sometimes Harry in the fansub, depending on translator.  He is a relatively ordinary 13 year old kid who lives with his single, alcoholic mother in a hut in a jungle community.  One day he is sent to get some bananas, has a strange, and quite terrifying experience, and returns to find his mother has taken in a house guest.  A cute little girl who goes by the name of Guu.  Hare senses something is not right about this little girl, and the next morning she looks like a completely different person, think Mandy of the ""Billy and Mandy"" cartoon series.  She's slightly mean looking, and talks all depressed, and sort of arrogant. The strange thing is only Hare seems to notice.  Whats more is this ""girl"" can apparently consume anything, and what she eats is transformed into an extra-dimensional world.Along the way despite instigating an endless degree of trouble, Guu eats, and later spits out, ""at least some of them"", various animals, Hare, Hare's classmates, the better part of an ocean, and a number of other things.  She also seems to have other ""powers"", not the least of which is always seems to know whats going on, and the ability to charm anyone by instantly changing her face to that charmingly charismatic little girl, Hare first saw her as.Oh yeah, plot, and a fairly serious one is behind the craziness.  Hales mother was a sickly child taken advantage of as an underage girl by a certain ""doctor"", who plays a prominent part in the series.  In the second half of the series, it changes locations back to the city where Hare's mom came from, and Guu serves more of a help there as opposed to her usual meddling role.  If you do the math, you'll realize how old Hare's mom is, and his age make for a very young mother. This whole seriousness would generally be lost, or at best feel out of place in most anime of this type.  Somehow it all seems to work here.  I'm half guessing they may water a bit of this down for American audiences, so you may want to leave the subtitles on, at least if you play the dubbed version.I can't speak here for the quality of the dub or extras, I'm still reviewing from the standpoint of the fansubs.  I an say it's a very vividly colored animation, and the music is bright and catchy.  Plus this is one of the few series that you'll not really be able to tell what's gonna happen next.  That in itself is worth the price of admission!",4,Super Milk Chan this is not!

But she's actually sarcastic, eerie and has a dimension inside.... her stomach.Yeah, ""Hare + Guu"" is a pretty cracked-out little anime series, where any semblance of normal is abandoned within the first five minutes. And the first volume -- four episodes long -- is an animated acid trip through a surreal jungle full of weirdos, freaky rabbit things, and a pair of very unusual small children.Ten year old Hare (pronounced ""Hah-ray"")lives in an idyllic jungle with his lazy mom Weda... until the day she brings Guu (pronounced ""Goo"") home. At first the children get along, but soon Hare finds out just how bizarre Guu is: she always looks flat, she's very sarcastic, and she likes to swallow weird things. And after she (temporarily) swallows Hare, he learns that she has a dimension in her stomach full of things she's swallowed -- people, animals, buildings, and so on.This is just the first episode, mind. It doesn't get any less weird.Unfortunately, only Hare seems to notice that Guu is kind of weird, and he begins trying to keep her from causing more trouble. With very limited success. On her first day at school, she swallows the entire class after they annoy her, then rips off the Elder's bushy chest hair to make herself an afro. And after seeing the Stupid Couple squabbling, Guu decides to have a romantic fight with Hare. And kiss everyone at the school as well...There are some wonderfully cracked out, whacked out anime series out there, with ""FLCL"" and ""Magical Shopping Arcade Abenobashi"" as some of my favorite examples. It's kind of obvious even from the opening credits (dancing banana trees! Red Riding Hood! Centipede-cats! Tropicalia!) that this series is a lot like those -- imagine a ""Swiss Family Robinson"" episode on some really amazing acid.The four episodes here are a string of colourful misadventures, usually caused by Guu trying to put everything in her mouth and Hare's manic reactions. Lots of jungle foliage, bright colours, weird wildlife (living jelly donuts?), weird dialogue (""I gotta admit, I'm a bit more worried about that voice that said 'Oh a bird' from inside Guu's mouth than I am about your horrible DEATH!"") and running gags.Hare really is a likable, responsible, goodhearted kid, albeit one who's doomed to have hypertension by fifteen -- in the first episode, his mom finds him sitting in a puddle of rain, giggling insanely. And in every other episode, he stresses himself out about keeping Guu from getting trouble (""I'm worrying about things way too much... I'M STILL WORRIED!"").And Guu is a hilarious source of chaos: social obliviousness, machine-gun laughter and attempts to swallow everything (including the teacher). And there are lots of other wacky people -- a guy who laughs ALL the time, a superhumanly lazy teacher, the flaky Marie, an elder who treasures his undulating mass of chest hair, and the cheesy and excitable Stupid Couple (who sound an awful lot like Rukia and Ichigo from ""Bleach"").""Hare + Guu Volume 1"" is a hilariously acid-soaked debut for an unspeakably hilarious little series. It may look cute and innocent, but like Guu it has a wicked sense of humor.",5,BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT I WAAAAAAAANT...,1238630400,"04 2, 2009",2009,3189,"['angelic', 'pink-haired', 'orphan', 'girl', 'actually', 'sarcastic', 'eerie', 'dimension', 'stomach.Yeah', 'Hare', '+', 'Guu', 'pretty', 'cracked-out', 'little', 'anime', 'series', 'where', 'semblance', 'normal', 'abandoned', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'first', 'volume', 'four', 'episodes', 'long', 'animated', 'acid', 'trip', 'surreal', 'jungle', 'full', 'weirdos', 'freaky', 'rabbit', 'things', 'pair', 'very', 'unusual', 'small', 'children.Ten', 'year', 'old', 'Hare', 'pronounced', 'Hah-ray', 'idyllic', 'jungle', 'lazy', 'mom', 'Weda', 'day', 'Guu', 'pronounced', 'Goo', 'home', 'first', 'children', 'get', 'along', 'soon', 'Hare', 'out', 'just', 'how', 'bizarre', 'Guu', 'always', 'flat', 'very', 'sarcastic', 'swallow', 'weird', 'things', 'temporarily', 'Hare', 'dimension', 'stomach', 'full', 'things', 'swallowed', 'people', 'animals', 'buildings', 'so', 'on.This', 'just', 'first', 'episode', 'mind', ""n't"", 'get', 'less', 'weird.Unfortunately', 'only', 'Hare', 'notice', 'Guu', 'kind', 'weird', 'trying', 'keep', 'causing', 'more', 'trouble', 'very', 'limited', 'success', 'first', 'day', 'school', 'entire', 'class', 'annoy', 'then', 'Elder', 'bushy', 'chest', 'hair', 'make', 'afro', 'seeing', 'Stupid', 'Couple', 'squabbling', 'Guu', 'have', 'romantic', 'fight', 'Hare', 'kiss', 'everyone', 'school', 'as', 'well', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'cracked', 'out', 'whacked', 'out', 'anime', 'series', 'there', 'FLCL', 'Magical', 'Shopping', 'Arcade', 'Abenobashi', 'favorite', 'examples', 'kind', 'obvious', 'even', 'opening', 'credits', 'dancing', 'banana', 'trees', 'Red', 'Riding', 'Hood', 'Centipede-cats', 'Tropicalia', 'series', 'lot', 'imagine', 'Swiss', 'Family', 'Robinson', 'episode', 'really', 'amazing', 'acid.The', 'four', 'episodes', 'here', 'are', 'string', 'colourful', 'misadventures', 'usually', 'caused', 'Guu', 'trying', 'put', 'everything', 'mouth', 'Hare', 'manic', 'reactions', 'Lots', 'jungle', 'foliage', 'bright', 'colours', 'weird', 'wildlife', 'living', 'jelly', 'donuts', 'weird', 'dialogue', 'got', 'ta', 'admit', ""'m"", 'bit', 'more', 'worried', 'voice', 'said', 'bird', 'Guu', 'mouth', 'am', 'horrible', 'DEATH', 'running', 'gags.Hare', 'really', 'likable', 'responsible', 'goodhearted', 'kid', 'one', 'who', 'doomed', 'have', 'hypertension', 'fifteen', 'first', 'episode', 'mom', 'sitting', 'puddle', 'rain', 'giggling', 'insanely', 'other', 'episode', 'out', 'keeping', 'Guu', 'getting', 'trouble', ""'m"", 'worrying', 'things', 'way', 'too', 'much', ""'M"", 'STILL', 'WORRIED', '.And', 'Guu', 'hilarious', 'source', 'chaos', 'social', 'obliviousness', 'machine-gun', 'laughter', 'attempts', 'swallow', 'everything', 'including', 'teacher', 'are', 'lots', 'other', 'wacky', 'people', 'guy', 'who', 'time', 'superhumanly', 'lazy', 'teacher', 'flaky', 'Marie', 'elder', 'who', 'undulating', 'mass', 'chest', 'hair', 'cheesy', 'excitable', 'Stupid', 'Couple', 'who', 'sound', 'awful', 'lot', 'Rukia', 'Ichigo', 'Bleach', 'Hare', '+', 'Guu', 'Volume', '1', 'hilariously', 'acid-soaked', 'debut', 'unspeakably', 'hilarious', 'little', 'series', 'may', 'look', 'cute', 'innocent', 'Guu', 'wicked', 'sense', 'humor']",N/A

He doesn't mind because she's so indescribably cute and nice. They spend the night playing boardgames and bonding. But there's always the morning after.....At breakfast the cute little girl has disappeared and in her place is a lethargic, morose, subdued Guu. Hare soon finds out that the cute girl image is just a front for a bizarre and creepy true identity. Guu's worst facet is that she eats things, and by that I mean ANYTHING! Elephants, people, her teacher, even Hare's little bird friend are her prey. And what's even more strange is that Hare has a dream that a whole world exists in Guu's stomach....or was it a dream...or was he eaten too? As the episodes progress, Guu is introduced to other inahabitants of the island paradise, with hilarious results. For instance, the village elder has a huge afro of hair on his chest that makes Austin Powers look shaven. Mysteriously, in the night, his hair disappears, but the next day Guu is sporting a poofy afro on her head. And then she crosses paths with one of Hare's school chums, who cannot stop laughing. Surely, Guu will find a way to get him to stop....I thought this show was going to be a disappointment at first but each episode got funnier and funnier and became infectiously hilarious. Maybe it was because the setting and characters are so odd, it takes a while to get acclimated to them. But by the fourth episode, you realize this is a real gem. Guu reminds me a lot of Snoopy from the Peanuts strips. The characters in this show are really vibrant and you feel like you know them by the end of this disk.
