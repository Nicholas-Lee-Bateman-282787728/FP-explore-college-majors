1085415,A2WJ6Y2KOXJ6FD,B000S6LS70,Cerebellum,"[2, 9]","Bear Grylls has a somewhat entertaining show but it is completely worthless from a survival standpoint. I do not like the Title ""Man vs. Wild""? There are enough people going against the natural world already. That title gives nature a bad name, like it is something you must fight against. The man has admitted to staging scenes of the show and staying in hotel rooms, to me, that discredits almost anything he has to say about natural living. If you are only interested in entertainment, then this show deserves about three stars. However, if you are interested in learning survival information, or not interested in seeing a fool run around in the woods, I would highly recommend Survivor Man. Also, any of Tom Brown's field guides are great for a person who is truly interested in survival and not just cheap entertainment.Also, NEVER drink your urine as Bear tells you to do. That ""survival advice"" can easily get you killed.",1,Man vs. Hotel,1230940800,"01 3, 2009",2009,929,"['Bear', 'Grylls', 'somewhat', 'entertaining', 'show', 'completely', 'worthless', 'survival', 'standpoint', 'do', 'not', 'Title', 'Man', 'vs.', 'Wild', 'are', 'enough', 'people', 'going', 'natural', 'world', 'already', 'title', 'bad', 'name', 'something', 'must', 'fight', 'man', 'admitted', 'staging', 'scenes', 'show', 'staying', 'hotel', 'rooms', 'almost', 'anything', 'say', 'natural', 'living', 'are', 'only', 'interested', 'entertainment', 'then', 'show', 'three', 'stars', 'However', 'are', 'interested', 'learning', 'survival', 'information', 'not', 'interested', 'seeing', 'fool', 'run', 'around', 'woods', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Survivor', 'Man', 'Also', 'Tom', 'Brown', 'field', 'guides', 'are', 'great', 'person', 'who', 'truly', 'interested', 'survival', 'not', 'just', 'cheap', 'entertainment.Also', 'NEVER', 'drink', 'urine', 'Bear', 'do', 'survival', 'advice', 'can', 'easily', 'get', 'killed']",N/A
1085416,A1FL9JCI32TC0Y,B000S6LS70,"D. Colley ""daz78""","[25, 27]","I was never really interested in 'survival' programmes on the context of the fact I live in a city/town and the only wilderness around here is a small family park with a small duck pond, not exactly the Rockies.I found survival documentaries slightly dull, not the programmes themselves, but the fact that it was a topic/genre I could not connect with or relate to. Survival experts seemed to belong to another lifestyle incorporating hunters through to paranoid doomsday nuts (I was very naive about the subject). Survival programmes usually had a barrel-chested bearded guy with glazed twitching eyes trying to show us how to make a smoking-jacket out of some poor rabbit and some leaves for a cravat.However, I really enjoy the Man vs. Wild ones. In fact, nowadays I like survival programmes a lot, and my naivety about them is now only 'slightly pathetic'.I first watched this on the Discovery channel, though it was re-titled (or may have been originally titled, I am not too sure) Born Survivor. I slowly come to liked it, listening to Bear Gryll's morbid stories of 'travelers' and 'hikers' meeting a doomed fate - he ALWAYS has a story to go with a poisonous plant, or a man-eating frog, etc. It was also funny watching him eat some gigantic insects to 'survive' and whilst he is telling us that these are good for us he squirms and chews with disgust at what the poor creature tastes like. There is also a slight Steve Irwin OTT drama about Bear Grylls also. For example, watching him jump off a helicopter with a slight over dramatic ""yee-hah!""Man vs. Wild is survival in a dramatic, but fun way, glamourising environments that most of us city dwellers will seldom see, besides sitting on our sofas watching TV.Grylls comes across as a likeable fella, he seems the type to be devoted to what he does, and I guess that's what makes the programme work well. It must be great to have a job one enjoys as a hobby.A lot has been said recently about 'faking' parts; I do not know why people would believe that these Man vs. Wild docs were 100 percent genuine. I spotted it first time I watched them, for example Grylls climbs a cliff type face yet the cameraman is at the top filming him climbing up, yet they are `all' together.The fuss over these programmes came about because of an uproar over 'fake' scandals on British TV (fake phone-in scandals, dodgy editing on a Royal family documentary trailer that made the Queen look like she walked out of a photoshoot in a huff when she was exactly walking IN to the photoshoot, and she wasn't in a huff). Grylls came into the firing line, though his seem the most innocent. His programmes are fun and educational, if you really think that he can walk across most of Alaska and suddenly find an abandoned boat to rescue himself are slightly naive.Another clear indication to viewers that certain parts are dramatized for artistic lisence is that each episode has a 'plot' arc which is as follows: Grylls gets stranded (albeit, purposely), Grylls has to get to a certain position covering many miles or/and obstacles whilst telling us how to accomplish it, and, finally, Grylls gets rescued or he escapes. It's that simple. The fact that certain things were planned was not shocking. He is showing how things should be done in the wild. If it was 100 percent real what are the chances he could find every plant he wanted to show us (""This is poisonous, don't eat it"") or get a camera crew up a cliff? I am sure Grylls, being one of the youngest to climb Everest and being an ex-TA SAS Special Forces soldier could do all the stuff he wants to do, but people forget that programmes are made with the restrictions of lawyers, health and safety people and, most importantly, the liability and insurance restrictions. I also read somewhere that during his time with the SAS he broke his back from a parachuting mishap and spent months recovering, so I think he has already taken enough risks in his lifetime without folks calling him a 'fake'.I am not writing this review to defend the guy, however, as a fan of the series I was worried that they would not make any more, which would be a huge shame in my opinion.All in all, you have to take these programmes as they are - a dramatic calculated documentary about survival techniques that appeal to an audience that may not necessarily like 'survival' documentaries. It is fun yet informative, and whilst most of us will never experience some of the things Grylls does, I guess there are loads of us who wish we could get off our lazy arrses and experience some of these journeys through the exotic and hostile environments that our diverse world has to offer.If you like Bear Grylls stuff, you may also like Ray Mears programmes as well.",5,Great fun and

The makers and distributers of this program are very irresponsible in this regard. Parents, this is mainly a warning for you.Some of the ""techniques"" are baloney, and many of the ""survival choices"" the host makes are extremely inadvisable and should not be followed by the average person or even an intermediate wilderness adventurer.The fact that the show itself is faked is of secondary concern to me. The host sometimes stays in hotels when supposedly sleeping in the wild, several scenes are faked, and the crew does a great deal of the work for the host. Why is this? For entertainment certainly, but more importantly because a lot of what he does is extremely... stupid. So stupid, sketchy and far-fetched that not even Grylls would do it. (Some of the things he supposedly does on the show might have actually killed him if he had really done so.

First, the episode list that is listed here on Amazon, isn't what's on the actual DVDs.  There is no desert island episode, or Colorado Rockies for example.  Plus the episodes that are on the DVD, well they aren't the original broadcast edited versions...they've been re-edited.  For example, there is no horse taming scene in the Sierra Nevada episode.  Now while some may feel good about that, as they called some of those scenes fake, I think it's a poor choice to not include the ORIGINAL episodes as they were meant to be.And there are no bonus features on this disc, UNLESS you call ""deleted scenes"" from the Sierra Nevada episode (which the scenes in question are already included in the final cut of the episode anyway), and a quick montage of eating bugs as bonus material...then well, there really isn't anything here worthwhile.
