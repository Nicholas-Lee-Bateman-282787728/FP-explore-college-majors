My biggest problem is the relationship between the two lead characters - I never believed in it. It was ACTED, not EXPERIENCED, by the two actors.Their love scenes were so tightly choreographed to the cloyingly sweet soundtrack that they came off as cold and mechanical. It was like watching ballet dancers, not lovers. That may be either because the straight actors needed a rigid scenario to follow since there was no genuine sexual dynamic between them or because the director didn't know how else to stage those scenes. Either way, it's the director's fault.They were more believable outside the bedroom. There the actors were somewhat freer to be themselves and allow the characters to interact as persons, not having to try to force themselves to act like lovers. The story is fairly interesting but also not quite believable.My last comment regards other reviews, which make dumb comments like ""the Israel police are definitely as bad and vicious as the Terrorists they are trying to infiltrate"". That's simply not true.The Palestinians (here as in real life) are thugs, not hesitating to torture and murder even their own people just to ""set an example"", with the same moral compass as an LA street gang. The Israeli police are FIGHTING TERRORISM - in the most effective way yet discovered.Israel fights an unending battle for survival against a brutal enemy who surround them and outnumber them about 500 to 1. But despite their need for relentless vigilance, the Israeli police treat even their most dangerous suspects far more humanely than their Palestinian counterparts treat even their own people.Anybody who believes that if the Palestinians were given their own sovereign country they then would leave Israel in peace is a fool. They (rather the far more powerful forces who use them as pawns) will not rest until Israel has been totally obliterated.
