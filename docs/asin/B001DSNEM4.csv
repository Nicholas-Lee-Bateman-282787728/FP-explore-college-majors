I'm one who throws DVD cases in the trash, in favor of a DVD booklet where I can store hundreds at a time.The set is stacked in one plastic spindle, and that's all you need. All 5 seasons, ready to go. The episodes are crisp and clear, the audio is perfect. Episodes are listed on the Box by disc. No episode details are listed and that is the only drawback, as some episodes are titled after Led Zeppelin Albums.A special treat is the commitment to audio commentaries. Each season features more than 10 episode commentaries. It really adds replay value to the set. The writers, producers and actors comment, some actors comment on episodes specific to the development of their characters.Season 4 even includes a good amount of behind the scenes  footage. We can sit in on readers round tables, and table reads with the cast. In one bizarre clip, we hang out with Andy Dick in his trailer discussing a musical he has written. One of my favorite clips is being a fly on the wall during the filming of an episode. Each bonus clip also includes commentary which can be turned off. Not to mention gag reels, and the producers even do spoofs of the show itself.Fans of NewsRadio should not miss this set! it is worth more than the listed price, and like me, you will enjoy it over and over because of all the bonus content.",5,Great Compact Package for a Great Series.,1318809600,"10 17, 2011",2011,1369,"[""'m"", 'tired', 'Muli-box', 'multi', 'sleeve', 'DVD', 'releases', ""'m"", 'one', 'who', 'DVD', 'cases', 'trash', 'favor', 'DVD', 'booklet', 'where', 'can', 'store', 'hundreds', 'time.The', 'set', 'stacked', 'one', 'plastic', 'spindle', 'need', '5', 'seasons', 'ready', 'go', 'episodes', 'are', 'crisp', 'clear', 'audio', 'perfect', 'Episodes', 'are', 'listed', 'Box', 'disc', 'episode', 'details', 'are', 'listed', 'only', 'drawback', 'episodes', 'are', 'titled', 'Led', 'Zeppelin', 'Albums.A', 'special', 'treat', 'commitment', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'season', 'more', '10', 'episode', 'commentaries', 'really', 'replay', 'value', 'set', 'writers', 'producers', 'actors', 'comment', 'actors', 'comment', 'episodes', 'specific', 'development', 'characters.Season', '4', 'even', 'good', 'amount', 'scenes', 'footage', 'can', 'sit', 'readers', 'round', 'tables', 'table', 'reads', 'cast', 'one', 'bizarre', 'clip', 'hang', 'out', 'Andy', 'Dick', 'trailer', 'discussing', 'musical', 'written', 'One', 'favorite', 'clips', 'being', 'fly', 'wall', 'filming', 'episode', 'bonus', 'clip', 'also', 'commentary', 'can', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'Not', 'mention', 'gag', 'reels', 'producers', 'even', 'do', 'spoofs', 'show', 'NewsRadio', 'should', 'not', 'miss', 'set', 'more', 'listed', 'price', 'will', 'enjoy', 'bonus', 'content']",Newsradio: The Complete Series

1183164,A1FW37K0DKH5M9,B001DSNEM4,David Seaman,"[4, 4]","Paul Simms created a TV Series that (sadly)lasted onlyu 97 episodes. The indisytry requirement for syndication is 100 episode4s. This show is called ""News Radio"" and it makes ""WKRP"" look like ""My Mother The Car."" To begin with we have an ensemble cast that rivals any of the legendary casts in history (including ""Friends"", ""The West Wing"" and ""Will & Grace"" with outrageously funny writing that borde3red on the insnane from time to time- as did the characters themselves- and a set as brilliantly designed as ""Cheers"". There are episodes of this series that rival ""Chukles Boites The Dust"" as funniest epsiodes in history (Matthew Brock and his hysterical mispronounciation of Joey Buttafuco on the air; Jimmy James' heart attack, The Jumper,) It's almost a Bob Newhart style, where a rational and normal man is set into a group of luhnatics and expected to lead them.Two things occured to this show that heold it back. The first was the untimely murder of one of it's stars, Phil Hartman and though they replaced him with Jon Lovgtiz, one of the fiunniest men in America, no one really fell into a pattern of how to write for him- his strengths weren;t utilized and where he was Hafdrtman's best friend it's possible that the chemistry could never have worked anyway. The second was the Network who kept throwing in stupid tested elements, forcing 434 productions to do things tyo placate the American audience, thinking they would please as manyt as possible and subsequently dissapointing all. In Season 5 we had the addition of Future ""gilmour Girls"" star, ANdrea Plan B who dominated an Arc that caused me to stop watching the series while it airted. Then the addition of a tall handsome wino to whom Lisa got married pushed us away from the characters we'd grown to love and into worlds with characters we simply didn't like. For this, ther show loses a star.Despite this, it's well worth buyingthe series and watching the first four seaqsons over and over and over. Enjpoy Viki Lawrence- a remarkable talent, and Phil Hartmen, who is a lovablke cipher, Steven Root and his remarkable comic timing, Then there is Andy Dick who is a blend of Andy Kaufman and David SChgwimmer; his willingness to do anything to make us laugh and his knack for pjhysical comedy. Joe Rogan, who would become famous for feeding goat entrails to idiot Americans on ""Fear Factor"" is an actor and comdeian of such brilliance that his chemistry with Andy Dick on this show was worthy of ruminating over possible ways to paiur the two if not in ""The Odd Couple"" on Broadway, then some sit-com. one would never guess that the beef-cake brilliant actor Rogan and the skinmny, loing fingerer Dick could have a Tracy/Hepburn or Newman/Redford chemistry, but they do.The show is full of miustakes, but it's a rare series that isn;t and watching a series upwards of ten times gives a critic the opportunity to do something no one of the production team could do: How many siblings did Matthew have? How many birthdays each year did Catherine Duke have? (It's like Helen CHappel's sister, Lorraine who is then brought onto the series full time in season six and her name is Casey and came from San Francisco, not Maui.)There are many inside jokes with this show that must have begun withg the production team (certainly I'm not the only one who wished they would fired their cosume designer) but it becane clear that our writers either epent a lot of time drinking or a lot of time doiscussing ""Firefly"" while playing Video Games. I'd guess that the writers room had no living plants ajd the coats stretched across chairs were denim or polar fleece and not Burberry, but these guys were brave and brilliant.So I place this one in the top ten of all time simply because half the erpisodes are brilliant. Some of the episodes were phones in, but they handled the motion picture schedules of Hollywoods finer actors, the murder of one of their best actors and a network who was fighting to learn that there IS no formula to creating and producing a hit sit-com; like all art, it is a miracle and it doesn';t alw3ays have to do with quality. This is why ALF was a hit and Stio 60 lasted only 24 episodes. George's Seurat never sold a painting in his lifetime and Norman Rockwell died a millionaire.As for the manty typos here I apologize: I suffer from a severe pns neuromuscular illness and to take the time to correct the errors would delay this review further- a review I've been meaning to write for more than a year.Secondly, buy this- gift this and you heard it here first: ""Good times... good times...""",4,When Genuis Arcade geeks meet Metwork Suits....,1332720000,"03 26, 2012",2012,4580,"['Paul', 'Simms', 'created', 'TV', 'Series', 'sadly', 'lasted', '97', 'episodes', 'indisytry',

1183170,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B001DSNEM4,Mark Turner,"[11, 16]","As any actor will tell you, comedy is not easy. And comedy shows in particular are not easily made nor do they stand the test of time. Many shows that were benchmarks in their day do not hold up well years later. Then there are the jewels that DO stand up with repeated viewings at a later date. Such can be said of NEWSRADIO.The show only aired for 4 years and yet it had some of the funniest scenes ever committed to video tape. It covered some topical issues but not to the point of preaching and not to the point where the discussions aren't relevant today. But best of all was that this was an ensemble cast that worked.I've often said that ensemble casting in television shows is the way to go. With a wide ranging casts the hopes and dreams of the show aren't placed on the shoulders of just one person, the make or break burden that leads to celebrity meltdown. A great ensemble casts spreads the jokes around, makes everyone a part of the plan and offers some of the best comedy and acting there is. Such was the case with NEWSRADIO.The story revolved around the new station manager, Dave Nelson (Dave Foley), just in from the Midwest and now the manager of WNYX, an all news station in New York. Where one would expect the show to adopt the fish out of water aspect, it never happens. Instead we have a fresh take on the country bumpkin going to New York. He isn't a bumpkin at all! He's pleasant, affable and tries to rope in the staff and anchors that work at his station. And he does so well considering who that is. Foley does an upstanding job as Dave, making him appear nave and yet capable of handing himself.Stephen Root stars as station owner Jimmy James. What an incredible character this is. And I think that this was/is the best part that Root has ever played. Jimmy is incredibly wealthy and yet never seems snobby. Jimmy can buy and sell as he pleases, yet holds on to this station. Jimmy often times seems incredibly stupid and simple, yet beneath it all he knows more than anyone in the building. To portray this person and do make it work shows some fantastic acting chops.Maura Tierney is Lisa Miller, the top news writer and all around station fixture who takes care of everything. Her belief was that she would get the job now handed to Dave. The two face off immediately with malice in her eyes. So what's next? They jump into bed together and become a secret item in the office.Vicki Lewis is Beth, the all knowing, all seeing, all commenting smart alek of an employee who knows the dirt on everyone. She's the one who offers the quickest of quips when things happen and stirs the pot when she can.Joe Rogan is Joe Garello, the handy man in the office. Mr. Fixit can whip up a computer, fix the station's microphones or create an exploding block of cheese in an attempt to discover who is stealing food from the fridge (one of my favorite moments). Here again we have someone who appears simple minded yet knows all the tech that runs the station.Of the cast here Khandi Alexander seems to be the least used. But when she is the biting criticism of her character, the standoffishness of her aloof Catherine Duke, news anchor, is such that she still seems approachable. Her remarks to co-anchor Bill McNeal offer the counterpoint to his sarcasm. She goes toe to toe with him and stands her ground.Matthew Brock. This character is perhaps the only funny thing that comedian/actor Andy Dick has ever done. Since the show I've not seen him be funny once. But here, he drew viewers towards him every time he stepped into a scene. He was the goof, the oddball, the nerd and he did it well. Not only did he play the character that way but he had a puppy dog attitude that made you feel for him while laughing at his antics.Best for last. Phil Hartman as Bill McNeal. When you watch this DVD, you can't help but feel a certain amount of sadness knowing that Hartman is gone. While he was amazing on SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE, he truly shines here. Hartman doesn't take center stage all the time, rather sharing the limelight with every other cast member. But when he's there you can't help but be amazed at how natural everything he does seems. His character is filled with egotistical mania, considering himself to be the best that there is in this station. And at the same time he does some of the most ridiculous stuff or misquotes famous lines. It is Hartman and not McNeal that makes for one of the most interesting members of the cast.So now you have the cast. How does that make a show? Simple, they all work well together. Each one plays off of the other, none of them stepping on the toes of the next cast member. While watching you never feel like one member or another is the centerpiece of the show. Each has their own moment in the spotlight. This is what makes great ensemble acting.The stories range from the simple (Dave having to fire the man he is replacing) to the ridiculous (the staff setting off rat traps because they have adopted the rat in the room). Certain episodes make the serious funny like the attempts of Bill McNeal to stop smoking that starts with him simply ignoring the no smoking rule.So we have a great cast, great stories and great directing. Is there anything at all wrong with this series? Once I find it I'll let you know. As for now the chance to own the complete series in one box for a more affordable price than buying them separately is enough to make you whip open your wallet. This is one that is worth having on your shelf. I doubt there would be a time (with the exception of a loved one dying) that you couldn't pop in a disc from this set and find yourself laughing. In today's serious world, that alone makes it worth the money invested.",5,HELLO LISTENERS...,1225152000,"10 28, 2008",2008,5709,"['actor', 'will', 'tell', 'comedy', 'not', 'easy', 'comedy', 'shows',

The entertainment industry weenies continue to see how little value they can give you for the highest possible price.  Unfortunately, packaging is the one (the others are double sided disks that get scratched no matter how carful you are and compressing the show, to squeeze more on each disk, reducing the quality).  This time they hit a new... all time low!  When you open the box you will find a paper thin plastic ""space filler"" shrink wrapped (so thin, the wrap bends it all out of shape) with a piece of cardboard on a spindle.  Pry the cardboard up and you will find all 12 disks stacked on top of each other.  That's it.  I really can't explain how cheap this was done.  I've thrown away packing materials that were far superior.  I'm sure they would respond that "" they want to keep the price down so we can afford to buy it"".  Since I can buy a thin jewel case retail for about 10 cents, we are talking pennies at the manufacturing level...not wholesale - that cost could realistic be 1 cent.

1183178,A3DZCNEU21MB6L,B001DSNEM4,"THowerton ""SHowT""","[1, 1]","This is an absolute steal!  $20-30 bucks for the entire News Radio series?  The best comedy sitcom ever!?!  You can't go wrong here.The series revolves around straight man Dave Nelson (played with put-upon determination by Kid's In the Hall actor Dave Foley), who is only an odd-duck himself in that he can tolerate a cast of fellow odd-ducks without having a nervous breakdown, managing a disparate cast of characters at a radio news station.  Among the comedy gold stands out Phil Hartman playing pompous and argumentative Bill McNeal through the first four seasons.  One of my favorite moments from this show was when Dave, who is trying to uphold the no-smoking ban in the office much to Bill's chagrin, challenges Bill to avoid smoking and throws in with him by himself giving up coffee.  Both men, straining to maintain a semblance of non-addiction professionalism, break down and vocally rip Matthew's character (played by Andy Dick who may not be likable in anything else he's ever done or as a human being) to shreds in a fit of addict-starved hostility.  The way they played off of each other is something that you hardly ever see anymore.  The other office oddballs are Joe (played by Fear Factor's own host, Joe Rogan), the handyman/ conspiracy theorist/ male man-child who can fix anything but you better not be around when it breaks; Jimmy James, the station's eccentric rich billionaire owner, who writes his own rules just so he can rule his own writings; Beth, the plucky do-nothing office assistant who never met a peacock dress that she didn't like; Catherine Duke (played by the lovely Khandi Alexander) who was essentially the competitive foil for Phil Hartman's character; the I-don't-know-what-I'm-doing Matthew who is dumber than a box of chocolates and is always in jeopardy of losing his job...or some body part (except for in the episode where he becomes ""SMatthew"", a.k.a. ""Smart Matthew"", when his boss Dave wants to keep him on staff); and Lisa Miller (played by E.R.'s Maura Tierney), the lioness who is who is Dave's intellectual equal and competitor as well as his lover.The writers of this series deftly weave and connect 2-3 story threads in each episode a la later seasons of Seinfeld.  Each of the character's are sympathetically portrayed and played and this group of actors worked extremely well with and off of each other.  There were almost always several laugh-out-loud moments in each episode and you frequently did not know what was going to happen next (Jimmy James falls out a window when the stock market drops--only to see a moment later that that is what he was fantasizing about and considering; Bill McNeal biting into a sandwich and hearing that sandwich crunch like a bag of chips!).  There was a lot of physical humor in this series, often revolving around sight gags and Matthew's prone-to-fall character.  There was a lot of relational and situational humor and all of it was handled and blended very well.  The show took risks also in parodying other popular zeitgeists, like ""Titanic"", or in saying good-bye to important characters while simultaneously tugging at our heart and tapping our funny bone.  My wife and I literally cried when they said ""good-bye"" to Bill McNeal.  Unfortunately for us we lost the irreplaceable Phil Hartman after season 4 (R.I.P. my noble friend) and Khandi Alexander (after season 3 I think).  They chose not to replace Khandi's character (smart move, that would have been a distraction) but Bill's antagonistic relationship with boss Dave Nelson was a central relationship in the show and, if they were to go on, they needed to find a replacement.  It's true that nobody was going to be able to fill Phil's shoes in quite the same way so they went for bringing in another character with a quirky personality who could be a radio star--Jon Lovitz's Max Lewis.  An ""A"" for effort for all who tried but, like most of the other reviewers have said, the show just wasn't the same and the 5th season became the last.  Still, a good run it was and we have it collected here in its entirety.For those reviewers who have dumped low ratings on this due to the packaging (discs stacked together; no catalog of episode names; etc.) you have done this product (namely the show itself, with all of the extras and audio commentaries still on these discs) a disservice.  Better that you would have recognized the brilliance of the program and given that it's due while addressing the packaging issue in the review and ""starring"" it there.  For everyone else, bow down to Jimmy James' empire while you still can.",5,"Jimmy James says, ""You will buy this and make me more money.""",1327968000,"01 31, 2012",2012,4584,"['absolute', 'steal', '20-30', 'bucks', 'entire', 'News', 'Radio', 'series', 'best', 'comedy', 'sitcom', 'ever', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'here.The', 'series', 'straight', 'man', 'Dave', 'Nelson', 'played', 'put-upon', 'determination', 'Kid', 'Hall', 'actor', 'Dave', 'Foley', 'who', 'only', 'odd-duck', 'can', 'tolerate', 'cast', 'fellow', 'odd-ducks', 'having', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'managing', 'disparate', 'cast', 'characters', 'radio', 'news', 'station', 'comedy', 'gold', 'out', 'Phil', 'Hartman', 'playing', 'pompous', 'argumentative', 'Bill', 'McNeal', 'first', 'four', 'seasons', 'One', 'favorite', 'moments', 'show', 'was', 'when', 'Dave', 'who', 'trying', 'uphold', 'no-smoking', 'ban', 'office', 'much', 'Bill', 'chagrin', 'challenges', 'Bill', 'avoid', 'smoking', 'giving', 'up', 'coffee', 'men', 'straining', 'maintain', 'semblance', 'non-addiction', 'professionalism', 'break', 'down', 'vocally', 'rip', 'Matthew', 'character', 'played', 'Andy', 'Dick', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'likable', 'anything', 'else', 'ever', 'done', 'human', 'being', 'shreds', 'fit', 'addict-starved', 'hostility', 'way', 'played', 'other', 'something', 'hardly', 'ever', 'see', 'anymore', 'other', 'office', 'oddballs', 'are', 'Joe', 'played', 'Fear', 'Factor', 'own', 'host', 'Joe', 'Rogan', 'handyman/', 'conspiracy', 'theorist/', 'male', 'man-child', 'who', 'can', 'fix', 'anything', 'better', 'not', 'be', 'when', 'Jimmy', 'James', 'station', 'eccentric', 'rich', 'billionaire', 'owner', 'who', 'own', 'rules', 'just', 'can', 'rule', 'own', 'writings', 'Beth', 'plucky', 'do-nothing', 'office', 'assistant', 'who', 'never', 'met', 'peacock', 'dress', 'did', ""n't"", 'Catherine', 'Duke', 'played', 'lovely', 'Khandi', 'Alexander', 'who', 'was', 'essentially', 'competitive', 'foil', 'Phil', 'Hartman', 'character', ""I-don't-know-what-I'm-doing"", 'Matthew', 'who', 'dumber', 'box', 'chocolates', 'always', 'jeopardy', 'losing', 'job', 'body', 'part', 'episode', 'where', 'SMatthew', 'a.k.a', 'Smart', 'Matthew', 'when', 'boss', 'Dave', 'keep', 'staff', 'Lisa', 'Miller', 'played', 'E.R', 'Maura', 'Tierney', 'lioness', 'who', 'who', 'Dave', 'intellectual', 'equal', 'competitor', 'as', 'well', 'lover.The', 'writers', 'series', 'deftly', 'weave', 'connect', '2-3', 'story', 'threads', 'episode', 'la', 'later', 'seasons', 'Seinfeld', 'character', 'are', 'sympathetically', 'portrayed', 'played', 'group', 'actors', 'worked', 'extremely', 'well', 'other', 'were', 'almost', 'always', 'several', 'laugh-out-loud', 'moments', 'episode', 'frequently', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'Jimmy', 'James', 'out', 'window', 'when', 'stock', 'market', 'drops', 'only', 'see', 'moment', 'later', 'what', 'was', 'fantasizing', 'about', 'considering', 'Bill', 'McNeal', 'biting', 'sandwich', 'hearing', 'sandwich', 'crunch', 'bag', 'chips', 'was', 'lot', 'physical', 'humor', 'series', 'often', 'revolving', 'around', 'sight', 'gags', 'Matthew', 'prone-to-fall', 'character', 'was', 'lot', 'relational', 'situational', 'humor', 'was', 'handled', 'blended', 'very', 'well', 'show', 'took', 'risks', 'also', 'parodying', 'other', 'popular', 'zeitgeists', 'Titanic', 'saying', 'good-bye', 'important', 'characters', 'simultaneously', 'tugging', 'heart', 'tapping', 'funny', 'bone', 'wife', 'literally', 'cried', 'when', 'said', 'good-bye', 'Bill', 'McNeal', 'Unfortunately', 'lost', 'irreplaceable', 'Phil', 'Hartman', 'season', '4', 'R.I.P', 'noble', 'friend', 'Khandi', 'Alexander', 'season', '3', 'think', 'chose', 'not', 'replace', 'Khandi', 'character', 'smart', 'move', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'distraction', 'Bill', 'antagonistic', 'relationship', 'boss', 'Dave', 'Nelson', 'was', 'central', 'relationship', 'show', 'were', 'go', 'needed', 'find', 'replacement', 'true', 'nobody', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'able', 'fill', 'Phil', 'shoes', 'quite', 'same', 'way', 'went', 'bringing', 'character', 'quirky', 'personality', 'who', 'could', 'be', 'radio', 'star', 'Jon', 'Lovitz', 'Max', 'Lewis', 'A', 'effort', 'who', 'tried', 'most', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'show', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'same', '5th', 'season', 'became', 'last', 'Still', 'good', 'run', 'was', 'have', 'collected', 'here', 'entirety.For', 'reviewers', 'who', 'have', 'dumped', 'low', 'ratings', 'due', 'packaging', 'discs', 'stacked', 'together', 'catalog', 'episode', 'names', 'etc', 'have', 'done', 'product', 'namely', 'show', 'extras', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'still', 'discs', 'disservice', 'Better', 'would', 'have', 'recognized', 'brilliance', 'program', 'given', 'due', 'addressing', 'packaging', 'issue', 'review', 'starring', 'there', 'everyone', 'else', 'bow', 'down', 'Jimmy', 'James', 'empire', 'still', 'can']",Newsradio: The Complete Series

Oh and I just don't understand that Andy Dick what the heck is wrong with him... you always see him on some stupid reality TV show about rehab or something it is so freaking lame he is in his 40's, while I'm 20 and more mature then him...",5,GREAT,1285286400,"09 24, 2010",2010,655,"['show', 'probably', 'better', 'then', 'even', 'know', 'part', 'history', '90s', 'like', 'married', 'children', 'better', 'then', 'right', 'really', 'sad', 'what', 'happened', 'Phil', 'Hartman', 'was', 'such', 'funny', 'guy', 'then', 'have', 'life', 'end', 'what', 'call', 'peak', 'such', 'tragic', 'way', 'Season', '5', 'tried', 'really', 'feel', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'was', 'still', 'funny', 'none', 'less', 'Oh', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'Andy', 'Dick', 'what', 'heck', 'wrong', 'always', 'see', 'stupid', 'reality', 'TV', 'show', 'rehab', 'something', 'so', 'freaking', 'lame', '40', ""'m"", '20', 'more', 'mature', 'then']",Newsradio: The Complete Series
