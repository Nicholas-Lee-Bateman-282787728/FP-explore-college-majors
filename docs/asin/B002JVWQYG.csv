There's no doubting Mike Henry's voice talent; and, let's face it, co-creator Seth MacFarlane has one of the crudest (in the nicest way possible) imaginations in comedy today.  The story structure borrows from both of MacFarlane's previous shows, FAMILY GUY and AMERICAN DAD: a mainly straight-forward sitcom structure with a few flashbacks and random skits.However, the show doesn't seem entirely cohesive yet.  MacFarlane hit his stride long ago (FAMILY GUY has gone downhill and you know it), and Cleveland Brown simply isn't an interesting enough character to hold our attention for long.  That's why we've been given the usual quirky additional characters: a jerk, a talking bear, a pimp baby, an overweight/naive/possibly homicidal kid, a tough-as-nails wife, and an inbred redneck and his grossly obese wife.  None of them really stand out (and most of it reeks of stale creativity).  The show will get a few well-deserved chuckles (I decided to continue watching it after a scene in the second episode involving a naked Cleveland and a scared opossum), but will never get any of those deep belly laughs you're really looking for.  It's worth a few viewings, but maybe not a permanent place on your DVD rack.",3,Not bad...,1285459200,"09 26, 2010",2010,1335,"['whole', 'season', 'second', 'season', 'just', 'starting', ""'m"", 'still', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'make', 'THE', 'CLEVELAND', 'SHOW', 'doubting', 'Mike', 'Henry', 'voice', 'talent', 'let', 'face', 'co-creator', 'Seth', 'MacFarlane', 'one', 'crudest', 'nicest', 'way', 'possible', 'imaginations', 'comedy', 'today', 'story', 'structure', 'MacFarlane', 'previous', 'shows', 'FAMILY', 'GUY', 'AMERICAN', 'DAD', 'mainly', 'straight-forward', 'sitcom', 'structure', 'few', 'flashbacks', 'random', 'skits.However', 'show', ""n't"", 'seem', 'entirely', 'cohesive', 'yet', 'MacFarlane', 'hit', 'stride', 'long', 'ago', 'FAMILY', 'GUY', 'gone', 'downhill', 'know', 'Cleveland', 'Brown', 'simply', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'enough', 'character', 'hold', 'attention', 'long', 'why', ""'ve"", 'been', 'given', 'usual', 'quirky', 'additional', 'characters', 'jerk', 'talking', 'bear', 'pimp', 'baby', 'overweight/naive/possibly', 'homicidal', 'kid', 'tough-as-nails', 'wife', 'inbred', 'redneck', 'grossly', 'obese', 'wife', 'None', 'really', 'stand', 'out', 'most', 'stale', 'creativity', 'show', 'will', 'get', 'few', 'well-deserved', 'chuckles', 'decided', 'continue', 'watching', 'scene', 'second', 'episode', 'involving', 'naked', 'Cleveland', 'scared', 'opossum', 'will', 'never', 'get', 'deep', 'belly', ""'re"", 'really', 'looking', 'few', 'viewings', 'maybe', 'not', 'permanent', 'place', 'DVD', 'rack']",N/A

I argue that American Dad is the best, Family Guy is past its prime and the Cleveland show has yet to find its voice. I believe that the Cleveland Show has potential, but it has to first distance itself from the overplayed legacy of Family Guy.The first few episodes of the Cleveland Show are terrible attempts to Derain laughs which are rare when they do come. I think one of the most positive steps the show has taken in its first season is getting rid of the Family Guy style cutaways prevalent in the pilot. Cleveland is an interesting character, as is Cleveland Jr and Roberta. The character of Rallo is played for laughs and comes off as a painful riff on a stereotype getting away with it as essentially, Black Gangsta Stewie. The character of the Bear is odd and hard to identify with, mostly because it does not play a central role and seems out of place. To be honest, the small guy is a one joke character who should have been eliminated shortly after his introduction (I never bothered remembering his name). Lester is a hick who I give credit for being developed throughout the season but also comes off one-dimensional.The Cleveland Show is attractively animated and the performance of Mike Henry creates a likable character trying to get by.

Cleveland was always seen as the supporting character that was funny every now and then but I couldn't see a show focused on him being that great. But when it aired I decided to check it out, and was somewhat surprised. While Cleveland isn't the most constantly hilarious guy, this show does work in my opinion. But, it's the supporting characters that really save this show. Rollo is a great counter point to Stewie, Cleveland Jr. can make me laugh just with that voice(nods to KMR). While Cleveland Show may not be to the quality of early Family Guy, it's not a flop in the least. I know alot of people brought up that Quagmire should've been the one to get the spin-off, and while Quagmire is a fantastic character and is pretty much always coming with a ""lol"" moment, I think he's the kind of character that works in small doses. Too much of a good thing can be a bad thing, and Quagmire having his own show would fall into that category for me. But I digress.

I say this because the show isn't very funny but is as, at least one other reviewer noted, one of the crudest cartoons on tv. Some of the humor on this show could almost be compared to ""Drawn Together"". The thing is that CHILDREN watch these shows. Family Guy and American Dad are raunchy enough but The Cleveland Show just rubs our faces in filth at times.As for the show I think it would have been better for Cleveland to have remained single. As it is he has an instant family, and one that is not interesting. And, YEAH, Family Guy has a talking dog and a talking baby, both of whom are SMALL, but this show has a HUMONGOUS TALKING BEAR. Talk about the ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM. The Bear is RIDICULOUS. Stewie and Brian the dog are classic characters and one EXPECTS such characters in ANY home, but a BEAR???????????As for Cleveland I think it would have been more fun to have him DATE to help the audience BELIEVE in a family should he ever have one. As it is Cleveland is suddenly a father figure of children and he has a wife. Was Clevelandever a father with Lorretta? Has Cleveland EVER been a father??? If the man was never a FATHER then HOW in the HELL is he suddenly SO WELL ADJUSTED????I think a better spin off character would have been Family Guy's wheelchair bound guy. Or perhaps Quagmire might have been a better choice. The problem with Quagmire though, giggidy, is that he already was such a raunchy character to where we probably didn't want to know much more about the guy.I guess we should be grateful that Seth McFarlane didn't use Peter's CHICKEN rival for a show.I doubt the Cleveland show will last much longer.
