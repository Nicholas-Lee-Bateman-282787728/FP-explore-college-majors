That is somewhat surprising as it is a somewhat classic tale.  It is the story about a group of layabouts led by a character played by Spencer Tracy.  They try to survive by mooching rather than working and, when one of their group inherits from his grandfather, they move in to share in their friend's good fortune.  It is considered a sin for one of their group to actually take a job, even though jobs are available (the motion picture was filmed in 1942 after the economy had picked up following the Great Depression).  Marriage is to be avoided, because that would cause a man to work.Some characters come across much stronger than others and tend to carry the motion picture forward.  Overall, it is not five star, but is worth watching.

306734,A1LTJCQGRPTOTD,6302308542,STEPHEN T. McCARTHY,"[8, 14]","INTERVIEWER: Welcome back!  We're here again with Stephen T. McCarthy and discussing the Hollywood classics in glorious black and white.  Tell us, Stephen, what makes TORTILLA FLAT, the 1942 adaptation of John Steinbeck's novel of the same name, one of your favorite films of all-time?McCARTHY: Well, there's a great deal of wine-drinking in it.INTERVIEWER:  Ha!-Ha! Alright, but really now, why does Tortilla Flat rate so high with you?McCARTHY: Because in watching it - or even just discussing it - I get a kind of contact high.  I mean, they drink AN AWFUL LOT of wine in this movie!  But beyond that, it's simply a wonderful production of a truly funny and heartwarming story.  Also, one of the prime examples of how some of those marvelous character actors of yesteryear could sometimes steal a picture right out from under the stars during the Golden Age of Hollywood.INTERVIEWER:  The stars in this case being Spencer Tracy and John Garfield?McCARTHY: Right.  And Hedy Lamarr is the high candy.  Excuse me - EYE candy.  Lamarr plays Dolores ""Sweets"" Ramirez, the Paisano girl who drives young, headstrong Danny insane with desire.  The virile Danny is portrayed by Garfield.  When he unexpectedly inherits two houses in Tortilla Flat, it sets off a whole chain reaction of events that soon threaten to dissolve his old friendships and undermine the sway that the cunning and manipulative Pilon - played by Tracy - holds over him.  Soon, Pilon and ""Sweets"" are engaged in a power stwuggle - uhm, STRUGGLE - for influence with Danny, while his oddball collection of loafing friends shpend their days trying to devise new ways of acquiring more wine ... short of working for a paycheck, that is.  It's fabulous fun!INTERVIEWER Some viewers have expressed dissatisfaction with how the story deviates somewhat from Steinbeck's book.McCARTHY:  Sure, but what some people fail to realize is that novels and movies are two separate mediums and each has its own requirements - a certain form that must be adhered to generally in order to successfully relate a story.  A novel has plenty of time to unfold, but a movie has 90 to 120 minutes in which to tell its tale vishually. Uhm, visually.  You don't build a house like a boat and you don't build a boat like a housh. House. A film demands a centwal conflict, and the third wheel ""love twiangle"" - which occupies only a small segment of Steinbeck's novel - becomes the catalysht ... catalysht ... [hic!] ... becomes the thing that dwives the film.  I think it was beautifully adapted to the big shcreen, retaining all of the charm and the overall tone of the novel.  And in shome ways, the movie is even better than the book!INTERVIEWER: But in the book, Danny--McCARTHY: Yeah, Danny dies!  How fun is that?  And ""Sweets"" Ramirez is descwibed as ""not pretty. Her voice is shwill ... shrill.  Her face is hard and sharp as a hatchet, and her figure ish lumpy.""  Who wants to shee a lumpy woman?  Huh? Tortilla Frat was directed by Victor Fleming. He diwec ... he directed GONE WITH THE WIND and THE WIZARD OF OZ, too; he knew what he wash doing!  Steinbeck wrote: ""What ish a Paisano? He is a mixture of Spanish, Indian, Mexshican and assorted Caucasian bloods. He speaks English with a Paisano accent, and Spanish wish a Paisano accent.""  I don't know what shortta accent Spensher Tracy was doing, but it's loushy.  But you get ushed to it after awhile.INTERVIEWER: Stephen, you mentioned the character actors.McCARTHY: They're mahvelous! Shtupendous!  They practically shteal the show!  John Qualen as skinny Jos[hic!] ... Jose Maria.  And Akim Tamiroff as big, dumb Pablo.  And Allen Jenkins ash Portagee Joe, who fallsh asleep everywhere.  Sheldon Leonard as the jailer who breaks out of hish own jail.  And eshpecially the great, great theshpian, Frank Morgan - he was the wizard in THE WI[hic!]ZARD OF OZ.  He playsh Pirate, the old man with a long beard who lovesh hish dogs.  Hish dogs are ""good boys.""  There's Enrique, and Paja[hic!]rito, and Fluff - he's a pug.  And Senor Alec Thompson, whosh a kind of an Airedale.  And Rudolph - he ish ""an American dog.""

Meanwhile, we'll get our establishing shot taken care of, and do some pickup shots, and maybe by then Stephen will be sober enough to complete the interview. ... Why, oh why?

306736,A2NK7K9DLLSBMC,6302308542,T.R. Hammer,"[1, 16]","I saw this movie on TCM. The Hispanic guest commentator was not impressed and neither was I. He spoke about it as if it was a train wreck, and, frankly, it's difficult to disagree.The extremely low-budget flick was pretty much a total waste of time and certainly a waste of talent. Spencer Tracy must have looked back on his illustrious acting career replete with two Oscars and many more Oscar nominations and wondered why he ever accepted the role. But even he wasn't consistent with his accent; it was all over the place.I thought it was insulting to Hispanics the way Tracy kept tricking them with simple tricks.I found it very difficult to give a damn about any of the characters. They were not properly developed. Even the early storyline about inheritance is ridiculously rushed.Hedy Lamarr does okay with her role and she is there for some kind of romantic subplot, but most of the time she's angry at the man who wants her and she ends up marrying. When she's not telling him to get away from her after he shows up at work, or the time he forces himself on her (sexual harassment), and gets out her knife, threatening to cut him to pieces, she's slapping him across the face for a rude remark he made about her being happy to marry anyone who has money.But then there's a huge jump from the non-relationship to them getting married at the end. What did he ever do for her? He bought her a vacuum cleaner (which she couldn't even use because her house didn't have electricity). That's one of my pet peeves about old ""romance"" in movies. The men and women do and say very little but somehow they're suddenly madly in love. O-kay. What-ever. It must be nice to be so easily impressed.Most of the characters had bad manners.
