Faced with loneliness and depression, we all have our moments of anguish and forlorness.  Casey Affleck plays the leading role with life's alienation written all over his face.  He has lost the paper chase out in the world and must--like many young adults nowadays--come home and live with the family until his luck changes.  The mother is supportive, but the father intimidates him from just feeding off their bounty, so he works at the family business and takes the menial jobs at the factory.  He tries to go to all the familiar watering holes, an exercise that only seems to make his inner hole bigger, until he meets a cheerful and generous nurse.  He also volunteers for a young girls basketball team, which he seems to go through the motions.He is also an aspiring writer, and he wears the despair of his greatest heroes on his sleeve, including Hemingway, whom he notes shot himself.  On one cheerful encounter with his mother (played wonderfully by Mary Kay Place) she asks Jim what they've done to raise two miserable boys:  ""Be honest...You're a smart and sensitive man, you should have some idea.""  He replies, ""Some people shouldn't have kids,"" a response that injures even her seemingly unflappable resource of cheerfulness.  His cousin Stacie works at the factory and brings his monetary resources to Jim who naively gets blackmailed by him from snitching when he uses the factory to mail drugs, and Jim's mother gets busted.Sometimes loneliness and depression are a disease.  The reason I recommend watching 'Lonesome Jim' is because it goes through it and glides on top of it at the same time.  His loneliness is as tangible as watching the futile anguish of Johnny Depp in 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape?'  The film is entertaining and cathartic, but it may have the best feature of confronting a part of all of us that is screaming to make life a better domain.",4,"""You Can't Always Get What You Want""",1165104000,"12 3, 2006",2006,1918,"[""'Lonesome"", 'Jim', 'presents', 'problems', 'Faced', 'loneliness', 'depression', 'have', 'moments', 'anguish', 'forlorness', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'leading', 'role', 'life', 'alienation', 'written', 'face', 'lost', 'paper', 'chase', 'world', 'must', 'many', 'young', 'adults', 'nowadays', 'come', 'home', 'live', 'family', 'luck', 'changes', 'mother', 'supportive', 'father', 'just', 'feeding', 'off', 'bounty', 'family', 'business', 'menial', 'jobs', 'factory', 'go', 'familiar', 'watering', 'holes', 'exercise', 'only', 'make', 'inner', 'hole', 'bigger', 'cheerful', 'generous', 'nurse', 'also', 'young', 'girls', 'basketball', 'team', 'go', 'motions.He', 'also', 'aspiring', 'writer', 'despair', 'greatest', 'heroes', 'sleeve', 'including', 'Hemingway', 'whom', 'shot', 'one', 'cheerful', 'encounter', 'mother', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'Mary', 'Kay', 'Place', 'Jim', 'what', ""'ve"", 'done', 'raise', 'two', 'miserable', 'boys', 'Be', 'honest', ""'re"", 'smart', 'sensitive', 'man', 'should', 'have', 'idea', 'people', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'kids', 'response', 'even', 'seemingly', 'unflappable', 'resource', 'cheerfulness', 'cousin', 'Stacie', 'factory', 'monetary', 'resources', 'Jim', 'who', 'naively', 'blackmailed', 'snitching', 'when', 'factory', 'mail', 'drugs', 'Jim', 'mother', 'busted.Sometimes', 'loneliness', 'depression', 'are', 'disease', 'reason', 'recommend', 'watching', 'Jim', 'glides', 'top', 'same', 'time', 'loneliness', 'as', 'tangible', 'watching', 'futile', 'anguish', 'Johnny', 'Depp', ""'What"", 'Eating', 'Gilbert', 'Grape', 'film', 'entertaining', 'cathartic', 'may', 'have', 'best', 'feature', 'confronting', 'part', 'screaming', 'make', 'life', 'better', 'domain']",N/A
997719,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000FZEU3S,A Customer,"[5, 7]","As bland and flat as the landscape in which it is set, this is indeed a strange directing vehicle for Steve Buscemi who has made a career out of acting in hard-edged gritty films. Lonesome Jim is a cheaply made, boring and lackluster film about a twenty-seven year old would be mopey writer who returns to his Indiana family after bottoming out in Manhattan.The whole film is dispiriting, pointless and morose as we watch Jim (Casey Affleck) advise his divorced older brother (Kevin Corrigan) to kill himself, be dismissive and occasionally cruel to both his mother (Mary Kay Place) - and even steal from her purse - and flirt with the beautiful nurse (Liv Tyler) he supposedly wants to date.Obviously Jim is terribly depressed  - he even keeps pictures of suicidal writers on his bedroom wall - but apart from the fact that he ran out of money in New York, the film offers few clues to the source of Jim's malaise, or that of his entire sad-sack family. Consequently, the story is directionless and rudderless and so indebted to deadpan, droopy, mopey blandness that the subject and the form become one, and end up leaving the viewer numb and indifferent.The main problem with Lonesome Jim is that the characters are just not that interesting. The film also tries for a kind of pokerfaced humor, which doesn't really work as it attempts to make light of Jim's situation. He's got no wit, no energy, no creative drive, and no spark of life. He's a big, self-indulgent idiot and the film is so closely allied to his dulled sensibilities that it's agonizing, even at its brief running time.In all fairness, Lonesome Jim does paint a realistic portrait of working-class, mid-western suburbia and the film does have some interesting things to say about following your dreams, with only hard work and a life plan ensuring success. Most of these people are stuck in some kind of rudderless life - choices are limited and their worldview is often narrow.Affleck, a sly comic and easily the best actor in his family, is suitably solitary and lifeless, maybe a bit too lifeless and Tyler is miscast as a small-town beauty. Fortunately Mary Kay Place rises above it all and provides is with a great portrait of a doting and somewhat neurotic mid-western mom.Lonesome Jim is indeed a lonely road of a film, it too often dawdles and never accelerates and apart from a thread where one character gets arrested for drug smuggling, the film doesn't seem to have much drama. Mr. Affleck and Buscemi have been weighed down with the difficult task of making grumpiness and petulance seem interesting. But neither of them really succeeds; consequently this film is almost dead on arrival.

It has a few laugh-out loud moments, and an overall sweet feel to it.  The subtle message of the film is that you might just be able to change your life -- albeit, a little at a time.Jim and his family are the very definition of dysfunctional.  He returns home from living in New York after quitting his job as a dog-walker.  That's right -- dog WALKER.  His mother, marvelously played by Mary Kay Place, is emotionally needy and all-but-clueless -- or, at least you think so in the beginning.  Jim assessment of his parents is overwhelmingly negative, though he usually expresses this in a very passive fashion.  Thing is, he is cognizant enough to realize that he, himself, is every bit as stuck in a rut.  When he meets Liv Tyler in a local bar, his view of things begins to change, but it is hardly overnight.  No fireworks, wine or roses here.  Just the subtle realization that there might be a different way to look at one's life.Far from being maudlin, the film acknowledges the character's shortcomings unsparingly, and yet does so in a way that is both comical and very nearly sympathetic.

Ben is sitting to the right of ole Papa Affleck and they're talking 'Good Will Hunting' Oscar winnings, Jennifer Garner, and all-things Matt Damon. Down at the end of the table sits one Casey Affleck at the kid's table, eyes tearing up and burning with jealous rage. For years, this has been the case for the Affleck family, Casey at the kid's table while Ben talks about his most recent big-screen successes. Once, Casey was asked about his movie career, to which he replied, ""Well, I made this film called Gerry that was pretty...."" only to find his father interrupting him at this point as he asked Ben, ""So what about this new film you and Morgan Freeman are making?""Then, like a gift from the movie gods, came Lonesome Jim, a bizarre, loveable dark comedy in which our boy Casey Affleck could finally sink his ready teeth.Lonesome Jim is a poor man's comedy, the type of film which can really only be appreciated by the Casey Affleck's of the universe, to which I readily admit I am one. In this world, underdog comedy is not only appreciated, but joyously celebrated. Jim, played by Casey, is a guy not unlike us. He has tried his hand at life, failed miserably at it, and returns in bitter defeat to his parent's basement. Here, he finds a guilt-tripping father who wants to run his life and a mother who is all-too happy to cut Jim's meet for him or let him borrow the family van. When it comes to women, Jim misses all the signals and often is left out thinking with over-analytical questions like, ""Was she coming onto me?"" as the girl, in the meantime, leaves it disgust when her advances are not reciprocated.This is the world of Lonesome Jim.

Lonesome Jim is (and Buscemi even admitted it) pretty short on plot, summing it up in a few words would be simple. But it's slightly more complex than that and is pretty damn funny and has a lot of heart. Remember the film ""Five Easy Pieces."" I'm not putting this film in the same category, but both movies are simple yet complex. Casey Affleck has been around about as long as his brother Ben, but rarely do you see him in lead roles. He's not leading man material, due to his skinny frame and wimpy voice. This role is perfect for him, because Jim is a pretty weak, small, and wimpy guy. Jim is a writer, who failed to make it in New York and is forced to move back in with his parents. His mother Sally (Mary Kay Place) is that typical movie mom. Overbearing, really sweet, and rather clueless. His father, Don (Seymour Cassel) is the typical movie dad. Doesn't really care. Jim also has a brother Tim (Kevin Corrigan, playing the same part he played in Buffalo 66 and TV's Grounded for Life. There's not a scene in this film where he doesn't look stoned) and figuring out who's a bigger failure is actually pretty difficult. At one point, Jim marvels to Tim""I'm a f**k up. But you're a tragedy."" Tim still lives with Sally and Don, has two daughters, coaches a girls basketball team that always loses, and works for a dollar over minimum wage. After Jim's speech, Tim crashes his car into a tree. The love story of Lonesome Jim is between Tim and Anika (Liv Tyler, who looks gorgeous), a nurse and mother of one. After meeting in a bar, we're led to one of the funniest (if not rather predictable) sex scenes I've seen in a while. For Liv Tyler fantatics, a quick side-note. There is no nudity. There's also the sub-plot about Evil (Mark Boone Junior), a man who works in Sally's factory dappling in drugs which eventually gets Sally arrested. The movie isn't hysterically funny, but one of those toned-down subtle comedies.It's not one of the best movies of the year, but it's definitely worth checking out. My biggest complaint is the cinematography. Out of the three films I've seen from IFC films (the other two being Sorry, Haters and Manderlay).

After having pondered this for a while it seems to me that it's a problem of tone.  The director couldn't make up his mind if he wanted this to be a straight romantic comedy or a black comedy.  There are some very dark aspects to the film---the accident the brother had after the ""hero"" told him his life wasn't worth living, the way the dad couldn't bother to post bail for his wife and the way the mom kept hovering over the son, even when he was in the bathtub.  These things could have been hilarious in another context but the way they appeared in this otherwise sort of sweet story was closer to horrifying.The moral of the story is to show, as per the coach's talk to the girls at the basketball game, that it's possible to change---that the way you were yesterday doesn't have to determine how you are today.  It's a good moral and the hero rises to his own words and becomes something like a responsible man, no longer just a slacker jerk.  That makes for a nice ending.  But for too much of the film we have to watch this fellow lope along being the passive recipient of his mom's love and the nurse's love.  He's so spineless and selfish that it was hard for this viewer to care about him.
