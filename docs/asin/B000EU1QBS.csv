This show definitely deserves the release of a full season, so hopefully Warner Bros will act soon.I also recently saw the 1974 movie Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore from which the TV series was developed. The movie is more drama than comedy but it is definitely worth a look.

But I post at Sitcoms Online, where the voting for the episodes for the disc took place, and apparently Warner Bros. is unsure if season sets of Alice would sell well or not.  So they decided to test the waters by releasing a TV Favorites collection with 6 episodes.  If it meets their expectations, they will for certain release seaon sets, but if it doesn't sell well then there is basically no chance.I understand it's absolutely ridiculous for us to have to buy a Best Of release in order to get season sets, but doing so for Alice would be worth it.  That's why I encourage ALL Alice fans to please buy this DVD and not boycott it because it's only a Best of release.  This DVD can make or break it's chance for season sets.  We have to make this disc a success.The episodes on the disc are as follows:08/31/76Alice Gets a PassAlice falls for an ex-football player, who is now an actor.02/26/77The Odd CoupleFlo's trailer is stolen, and Alice has the heart to let her stay at her house for a spell.

Alice, the sitcom, aired on CBS for 9 seasons between 1976 and 1985.  The showed starred Linda Lavin as a waitress and single mother named Alice.  She was going to college, raising her son Tommy and working in Mel's Diner alongside two characters named Flo and Vera.Everyone can recall Flo for her catch phrase ""kiss my grits.""  Vera was the dark haired wacky waitress. Mel was the grumpy diner owner.  Television Favorites Alice was released on DVD in late June.  The single disc DVD release includes six episodes of the classic episode.The episodes chosen are pretty good and a fan of the series will feel like they are getting a decent taste of Alice on DVD.  The set opens with the episode ""Alice Gets A Pass.""  Alice is digging a new guy and Tommy takes to him.  Much to her surprise Alice finds out the guy is gay.  In the episode ""The Odd Couple"" Alice and Flo find themselves mismatched room mates after Flo's trailer is stolen.  Flo drives Alice and Tommy crazy while she stays with them.  Next up is the episode ""Close Encounters of the Worst Kind.""  This is one of the funniest episodes on the DVD.  Alice and Flo get into an argument when Alice criticizes Flo's man eater behavior.  Before long everyone is arguing with each other and Alice brings the whole gang over to her house for some trust building exercises based on what she has learned in her psychology course.  Another great episode on the set is ""Block Those Kicks"" in which everyone working at the diner vows to give up one of their vices.  Mel struggles to give up gambling. Flo gives up coffee, Vera gives up smoking and Alice struggles to give up chocolate. Rounding out the set are the episodes ""Cabin Fever"" and ""Flo's Farewell.""A lot of Alice fans have been waiting for season sets of the show to arrive.  The show last 9 seasons--which is a long time for a sitcom.  Fans of the show should run out and pick up Television Favorites Alice.

Starring Linda Lavin in Ellen Burstyn's original role and returning Vic Tayback as Mel Sharples, the diner owner/cook with the salty vocabulary, the quartet of unfriendly Hollywood Ten witnesses set about creating a situation comedy that was so subtle in imparting its socialist messages of racial/class/gender equality that it did so with an all-white cast, which included Nancy McKeon's (The Facts of Life) brother Phillip as the boy with the single mother, predating the Murphy Brown controversy by at least 15 years.Getting ""Alice"" past the TV censors--a.k.a., the Sponsors--was no problem at all, because the crypto-communist messages of class division were cast as mere household and workplace spats within the well-worn paradigm of the comedy of manners.The chief instigator for the socialistic message of racial equality, surprisingly, was Polly Holliday, co-starring as the sassy, backtalking, Southern gal (read: black) waitress Flo. When she told oppressive male diner owner (read: capitalist honky) Mel to ""Kiss My Grits,"" Holliday's retort represented a very thinly-veiled comeback that downtrodden black Americans secretly wanted to unleash against their white racist overlords. Beth Howland as Vera was a stand in for lesbians, though her lesbianism was only implied in the faintest manner possible (her plain looks and lack of makeup), though she did foreshadow ""Ellen"" by more than two decades.While its producers meant ""Alice"" to be a modern version of a strike play (e.g., ""Waiting for Lefty""). it totally went over audiences' heads.  Although the class divisions (working poor versus oppressive boss poor) were sharply delineated, viewers could access *actual* racial tensions in the Norman Lear shows ""All In the Family"" and its spinoff, ""The Jeffersons."" In those programs, viewers could watch actual racial confrontations between white bigot Archie Bunker (Carroll O'Connor)  and ""uppity"" black George Jefferson (Sherman Hemsley).Unfortunately, Marxist critics were quick to point out, even those shows got the class disparity angle wrong by portraying Archie Bunker as a member of a favored social class (blue collar everyman) and Jefferson as a member of the oppressor class (black entrepreneur owner of a chain of drycleaners).In his groundbreaking monograph on the inherent class and racial divisions in both ""Alice"" and ""The Jeffersons,"" leading postmodernist critic Jean-Francois Lyotard opined that these ostensible socialists had lived too many decades under the oppressive capitalist American system, which had engrained a counter-productive bourgeoise prejudice in their latent assumptions of racial, class and gender biases.For a more extensive critique on the latent racism, sexism and homophobia in American sitcoms, read Lyotard's

It only served to remind me how far behind WB is in getting out some of their back catalog of Classic TV on DVD. Rumor has it that their successful Manufacture-on-Demand program will continue to grow in 2011, including more Classic TV series, rather than just the movies and cartoons they've been dealing with thus far.That being said, this is a nice starter volume and really should have been called ""Fan Favorites"". Unlike Sony's budget releases of the same name, which basically took the first disc of Season 2 of ""Bewitched"", ""All in the Family"" and repackaged and CALLED them Fan Favorites, WB actually polled fans back in 2005 for their input.I took part in that survey and was delighted to see that four of the six episodes I picked made the final cut. All six feature the original cast of characters: Alice, Mel, Flo and Vera. (I had picked one Jolene and one Belle episode. Actually, ""Vera the Vamp"" made a strong showing among other fans, but being a Belle episode, WB chose not to include it, wanting to stick with shows from the Flo era. My Jolene pick was ""Bet-a-Million-Mel"", my favorite of the whole series).My choices here include ""The Odd Couple"", in which Flo's stolen trailer results in her sharing Alice's apartment temporarily; ""Close Encounters of the Worst Kind"" is the episode with the water fight between the waitresses; the gang try and give up their various vices in ""Block Those Kicks""; and ""Flo's Farewell"" is self-explanatory. Her final ""Kiss my grits"" to Mel is surprisingly touching.Rounding out the DVD are ""Alice Gets a Pass"" in which guest star Denny Miller plays a gay football player dating Alice (VERY progressive for 1976!) and ""Cabin Fever"" featuring Victoria Carroll as Mel's main squeeze Marie.The episodes are all uncut and in great shape (no herky-jerky time compression here like when TNN ran these; or horrible butchering a la E! Network). I love the inside artwork too--it's designed like a placemat and diner menu--VERY cute!Season One has been available as a digital download for some time now, but c'mon Warners--I want a set I can hold in my hands and watch on my TV.

Their station wagon breaks down in Phoenix, Arizona and since they are now broke, she takes a job as a waitress in Mel's Diner which is owned by Mel Sharples (the late Vic Taybeck).  Fellow waitresses Vera Louise Gorman (Beth Howland) and the hilarious Florence Jean Castleberry (the fabulous Polly Holliday) become Alice's best friends and co-workers.  This was a very talented cast and the show itself was funny, down-to-earth and Flo's famous quip ""Kiss my grits!"" became one of the most popular catch phrases of the late 70's.Since most of the sitcoms which appeared during the same time period like ""All in the Family"", ""The Jeffersons"", ""Maude"", ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"", ""Sanford and Son"", ""One Day at a Time"", ""Barney Miller"", ""Happy Days"" and ""Laverne and Shirley"" have already had multiple seasons released on DVD, it's high time that Warner Brothers gives the fans what they want - Season 1 of ""Alice""!",5,There's a New Girl in Town - and she's lookin' good!,1258070400,"11 13, 2009",2009,1470,"['used', 'watch', 'Alice', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'as', 'much', 'love', 'compilation', 'series', 'best', 'episodes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Warner', 'Bros.', ""n't"", 'bothered', 'release', 'even', 'one', 'full', 'season', 'what', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'longest', 'running', 'sitcoms', 'television', 'running', 'CBS', '9', 'seasons', 'Alice', 'was', 'very', 'funny', 'sitcom', 'starring', 'Linda', 'Lavin', 'widow', 'aspiring', 'singer', 'Alice', 'Hyatt', 'who', 'son', 'Tommy', 'Philip', 'McKeon', 'leave', 'New', 'Jersey', 'home', 'death', 'husband', 'traveling', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'search', 'singing', 'career', 'station', 'wagon', 'breaks', 'down', 'Phoenix', 'Arizona', 'are', 'now', 'broke', 'job', 'waitress', 'Mel', 'Diner', 'owned', 'Mel', 'Sharples', 'late', 'Vic', 'Taybeck', 'Fellow', 'waitresses', 'Vera', 'Louise', 'Gorman', 'Beth', 'Howland', 'hilarious', 'Florence', 'Jean', 'Castleberry', 'fabulous', 'Polly', 'Holliday', 'become', 'Alice', 'best', 'friends', 'co-workers', 'was', 'very', 'talented', 'cast', 'show', 'was', 'funny', 'down-to-earth', 'Flo', 'famous', 'quip', 'Kiss', 'grits', 'became', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'catch', 'phrases', 'late', ""70's.Since"", 'most', 'sitcoms', 'appeared', 'same', 'time', 'period', 'Family', 'Jeffersons', 'Maude', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'Show', 'Sanford', 'Son', 'One', 'Day', 'Time', 'Barney', 'Miller', 'Happy', 'Days', 'Laverne', 'Shirley', 'have', 'already', 'had', 'multiple', 'seasons', 'released', 'DVD', 'high', 'time', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'fans', 'what', 'want', 'Season', '1', 'Alice']",N/A

Other classics include ""Block Those Kicks,"" from Season three, as well as an episode from Season two and one I remember as one of the funniest from the entire series titled ""Close Encounters of the Worst Kind,"" in which Alice convinces everyone to be honest instead of passive-aggressive, leading to disastrous yet hilarious results.",4,A great starter set,1164067200,"11 21, 2006",2006,872,"['Still', 'waiting', 'complete', 'seasons', 'Alice', 'be', 'produced', 'DVD', 'least', 'first', 'four', 'seasons', 'Truthfully', 'Alice', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'funny', 'Flo', 'was', 'gone', 'kind', 'Seinfeld', 'had', 'lost', 'one', 'three', 'sidekicks', 'gave', 'release', 'four', 'stars', 'instead', 'five', 'only', 'Flo', 'Farewell', 'sad', 'moment', 'series', 'are', 'classic', 'episodes', 'provided', 'package', 'Alice', 'Pass', 'very', 'early', 'episode', 'daring', 'one', 'handling', 'topic', 'homosexuality', 'such', 'open', 'way', '1976', 'Other', 'classics', 'include', 'Block', 'Kicks', 'Season', 'three', 'as', 'well', 'episode', 'Season', 'two', 'one', 'remember', 'one', 'funniest', 'entire', 'series', 'titled', 'Close', 'Encounters', 'Worst', 'Kind', 'Alice', 'everyone', 'be', 'honest', 'instead', 'passive-aggressive', 'leading', 'disastrous', 'yet', 'hilarious', 'results']",N/A
