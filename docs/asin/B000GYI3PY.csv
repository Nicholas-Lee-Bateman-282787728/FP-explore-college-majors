And yet, each of them would seem to want nothing more than a friend, some companionship.As described in the Beatles ""Eleanor Rigby"" ---""All those lonely people, where do they all come from?""The widow, played by the ever-lovely Joan Plowright, finds unexpected friendship with a young writer played by Rupert Friend. While the snoops in the hotel dining room are persuaded that this is the grandson who has been ignoring her, his charm wins not only Plowright, but all those lonely people.For seniors reading this review, let's hope we do not spend the final  period of our life alone. Keep reaching out, not only to family but to friends and potential friends.Even the residents of the Clarmont Hotel somehow manage to be a comfort now and then.""All those lonely people, where do they all come from?""

Unfortunately- and very sadly- it is often the older generation whose stories are treated as if they hold little value. In this gem of a movie the main character (played beautifully by Rupert Friend) develops a friendship with an older woman who teaches him a bit about life and not giving up on your dreams. Their relationship reminds us that the spirit of a person is not diminished by age, that wisdom is a treasure to be valued as much as friendship itself, and that our words and actions are not insignificant even if we aren't aware of their effect on someone else. There is so much we don't know and can't see beyond ourselves and our own life experiences, and we all have so much potential- more than I would guess most of us even realize. What if one small move on your part gave someone else the encouragement and inspiration they needed, and made a life-changing difference for them? What if someone did this for you?

And yes, Joan Plowright did receive a special award from AARP here in America for the role--but a close friend was obliged to accept that on Joan's behalf. Joan did send a special video message to the AARP awards dinner.Let me be very clear about something: MRS. PALFREY AT THE CLAREMONT is not a HAROLD AND MAUDE remake, or even remotely like that disgusting film. This is NOT A ""ROMANCE""! This is a movie about a lonesome old lady, once grand and happy, now alone. Confused about her new adventure of living on her own, she meets a lovely young man and makes him her honorary grandson. Later she says to his mother, ""I have been made a sort of honorary grandmother.""Sarah Palfrey (Mrs.), a lonesome but plucky, classy widow, finds her way to the Claremont Hotel--a new adventure in being on her own after the death of her husband Arthur. During her slightly madcap adventures fitting in to the senior-retirement-home climate at the Claremont, she meets a handsome twenty-something writer, Ludovic Meyer (a charming Rupert Friend). They hit it off, and Mrs. Palfrey soon realizes that she has a potential grandson at hand. Her own negligent a-hole grandson Desmond (Lorcan O'Toole, relative of Peter?) has left her in the lurch. ""Ludo"", as she calls her new grandson, will henceforth play Desmond's role.Happy adventures and a warm, wonderful feel await the viewer in this film. Set in southern England (I think it's London), there's even a bit of location-filming that delights greatly. There is no shortage of talent here either: we have Zoe Tapper as Ludo's girlfriend Gwendolyn; Anna Massey as Mrs. Arbuthnot; Anna Carteret as Elizabeth, Mrs. Palfrey's equally negligent daughter; Robert Lang as the perpetually tipsy Mr. Osbourne; and Millicent Martin as the eccentric Lorna De Sallis. It's a veritable who's who of great British talent.This film I think will appeal even to children, for it has a story to tell and never bores. Imagine the film in the hands of some blighter who can't tell a lens from a location. Too many of those out there.

Yet despite multiple attempts her grandson Desmond (Lorcan O'Toole) doesn't respond and Mrs. Palfrey realizes she has entered a world of loneliness.Out on an errand she falls and is befriended by a handsome young busker/writer Ludovic Meyer (Rupert Friend) who nurses her leg wound, makes her tea, and escorts her home. Ludo is a loner and lonely and when Mrs. Palfrey offers him dinner at the hotel he gladly accepts. But at the hotel the guests presume that Mrs. Palfrey's guest will be her grandson Desmond: Mrs. Palfrey hastily informs Ludo that she has erred and Ludo agrees to pose as her grandson. The guests at the hotel are charmed by Ludo, and Mrs. Palfrey and Ludo grow increasingly bonded - they share many likes and tastes and meld into a beautiful relationship that would be the envy of any grandmother and grandson. Mrs. Palfrey's loneliness is dissipated by Ludo and the effect is vice versa. How the two progress to the end of the film, finding new lives from old ones, forms the immensely touching finale to the film.Though this film falls into the 'ensemble acting' category, so finely entwined are the performances of every actor in the cast, the film clearly belongs to Dame Joan Plowright whose performance once again proves that she is one of the durable treasures of cinema and stage. This is a film that will touch the hearts of even the most hardened viewers and this viewer cannot recommend it more highly.

The residents are a mix of elderly and very lonely people, just like her.Mrs. Palfrey (Joan Plowright) is a pleasant woman. Living in London seemed like a good way to connect with her only grandson, who works at a museum and in her mind she pictures him lunching with her on Sundays.  After the move, she tries and tries to reach him by telephone, but weeks go by without his returning her phone calls. She settles in to thinking he will never visit her.Good things are never completely the way that we picture them to be and Mrs. Palfrey does make a few friends with the residents.  She also meets and is befriended by a young man who is helpful to her. When she eventually has her grandson  to visit, it's more than wonderful.

When widowed Mrs. Sarah Palfrey (Joan Plowright) decides to not be a burden on her daughter, she moves into the Claremont Hotel in London.  It's quite a disappointment from what she was hoping, but she makes do with amazing spirit. Unfortunately, neither her daughter or her grandson have time to visit her or even return her calls.One day a fortunate fall places her in the hands of young writer, Ludovic Meyer (Rupert Friend).  The pair are drawn to each other from the beginning and when she invites him to dinner, the other folks at the home believe that he's the grandson she's been extolling.  Neither Mrs. P. nor Ludo are willing to dissuade them, so they keep up the relationship.  Mrs. P. gets a chance at seeing the world through a young man's eyes and Ludo learns about the classics including Mrs. P.'s favorite film, which coincidentally gets him introduced to the love of his life.This ia a grand tale told only as the British could with elegance and understatement.

Hoping for elegance in spite of the Claremont's unexpectedly doughty appearance, she arrives in the dining room on her first night in her going-to-theater best, eager to make a good first impression on her fellow residents.  But rather than the storied salon of the Titanic, she finds herself in something of a commissary for cast-offs, a sparse room thinly populated with oddballs at assorted tables-for-one.  An eternity later she realizes that only ten minutes have in fact passed, and Mrs. Palfrey comprehends that she may have gotten herself into something other than that which she expected.But before the deadening gloom, maddening sameness, and reruns of Sex in the City can fully mummify her, a chance accident brings a young man, a seemingly aimless 20-something writer, into her life...and everything changes.  Too embarrassed to correct them when her fellow residents mistake the young man for her long-awaited and decidedly absent grandson, she finds herself playing surrogate grandmother when their ruse becomes permanent.  In him she finds the first friend of her new life; in her he finds the reassurance to be and believe in himself.Beautifully filmed and scored, intelligently written and acted, ""Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont,"" is warm without being sappy, insightful without being preachy, and clever without being silly.  The cast is simply perfect.Nothing in her life may have prepared Mrs. Palfrey for what she found at the Claremont; but she nonetheless faces it with an inspiring and infectious gusto that will make any viewer from twenty to seventy quietly pray that they will have half as much spirit in the December of their years.This is, quite simply, a movie not to be missed.",5,A Must See,1181606400,"06 12, 2007",2007,2156,"['came', 'world', 'sensible', 'choices', 'nothing', 'life', 'had', 'prepared', 'loud', 'confusion', 'herunexpected', 'present.So', 'enchanting', 'journey', 'Mrs.', 'Palfrey', 'Claremont', 'journey', 'discovery', 'renewal', 'affirmation', 'connection.Mrs', 'Palfrey', 'widow', 'years', 'just', 'moved', 'London', 'take', 'up', 'residence', 'Hotel', 'Claremont', 'things', 'strength', 'magazine', 'ad', 'mentioned', 'excellent', 'cuisine', 'Hoping', 'elegance', 'spite', 'Claremont', 'unexpectedly', 'doughty', 'appearance', 'dining', 'room', 'first', 'night', 'going-to-theater', 'best', 'eager', 'make', 'good', 'first', 'impression', 'fellow', 'residents', 'rather', 'storied', 'salon', 'Titanic', 'something', 'commissary', 'cast-offs', 'sparse', 'room', 'thinly', 'populated', 'oddballs', 'assorted', 'tables-for-one', 'eternity', 'later', 'only', 'ten', 'minutes', 'have', 'fact', 'passed', 'Mrs.', 'Palfrey', 'may', 'have', 'gotten', 'something', 'other', 'expected.But', 'deadening', 'gloom', 'maddening', 'sameness', 'reruns', 'Sex', 'City', 'can', 'fully', 'mummify', 'chance', 'accident', 'young', 'man', 'seemingly', 'aimless', '20-something', 'writer', 'life', 'everything', 'changes', 'Too', 'embarrassed', 'correct', 'when', 'fellow', 'residents', 'mistake', 'young', 'man', 'long-awaited', 'decidedly', 'absent', 'grandson', 'playing', 'surrogate', 'grandmother', 'when', 'ruse', 'permanent', 'first', 'friend', 'new', 'life', 'reassurance', 'be', 'believe', 'himself.Beautifully', 'filmed', 'scored', 'intelligently', 'written', 'acted', 'Mrs.', 'Palfrey', 'Claremont', 'warm', 'being', 'sappy', 'insightful', 'being', 'preachy', 'clever', 'being', 'silly', 'cast', 'simply', 'perfect.Nothing', 'life', 'may', 'have', 'prepared', 'Mrs.', 'Palfrey', 'what', 'found', 'Claremont', 'nonetheless', 'inspiring', 'infectious', 'gusto', 'will', 'make', 'viewer', 'twenty', 'seventy', 'quietly', 'will', 'have', 'half', 'much', 'spirit', 'December', 'years.This', 'quite', 'simply', 'movie', 'not', 'be', 'missed']",Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont
1008472,A387BD735MI50R,B000GYI3PY,R. Schultz,"[9, 22]","This is the sort of movie you want to like - and it does have some touching moments. But in the end, the intergenerational friendship portrayed here is just not believable. How often would a handsome young man rush out to help an elderly woman who has fallen in front of his apartment, scoop her up, invite her inside, bandage her bruise, serve her tea, and then befriend her and serve as her proxy son? This is especially true if the older woman turns out to be rather uninteresting.Yet that's what happens here. Joan Plowright is a distinguished actress with limpid, expressive eyes - but she isn't given much to do in this movie other than to be accepting and relatively sane compared to some of the mild eccentrics arcing around her in the hotel where she takes up residence. She really doesn't have anything profound or funny to say. The young man, and we the viewers, have to do all the work of imputing wisdom to her.This film does provide some interesting backward glances of pockets of old-fashioned London that staunchly persist into the modern world. There is the retirement hotel itself, where people still come down to occupy their reserved places for breakfast, in that Terrence Rattigan ""Separate Tables"" way that one of the characters remarks on. There are the drizzly London streets flanked by the black wrought iron grills.However in general, this is a sort of forced fairy tale, right through to its sanitized ""Love Story"" scene. It holds up the possibility for the sort of unlikely friendship that a lot of us, me included, might wistfully daydream about.

And that's exactly the situation Mrs. Palfrey finds herself in when she moves into a hotel-cum-retirement home, the Claremont.  It's a severe change of pace for Palfrey, but she gamely makes the most of it.  Meanwhile, she's told the residents that her grandson has promised to visit, but he never does.  Some suspect that this mysterious grandson is just a figment of the older lady's imagination.A chance encounter with a struggling writer leads to a visit to the Claremont, where he can get a nice meal and a nice chat.  Assumptions are made that this is Mrs. Palfrey's long-rumored grandson, a rumor Palfrey does nothing to dispel.Joan Plowright adds another great performance to a long and distinguished career in the titular role.  At times a bit daft, but mostly just sweet and a bit lonesome, Plowright fits the role to a T.  The audience has no trouble in believing her to be exactly whom she is playing.Rupert Friend plays Ludovic Meyer, a down-on-his-luck aspiring writer, and beautifully fits in as the long-absent grandson.  He's a bit puzzled at first, but true affection blooms between the two, and he makes a better and more dutiful relative than the real grandson obviously is.This is a sweet, poignant movie that is definitely worth watching, mainly for the performances of Plowright and Friend, but also for the bittersweet tale of love and loss, of the worth of the older person, who may have a hard time getting around, but has had a rich life and much to teach their younger compatriots.Strongly recommended.  Appropriate for most ages, but probably best targeted to those neglectful children (and grandchildren) who just can't seem to make any time for those who sacrificed so much to raise them.",5,Touching Portrait of a Forgotten Woman,1289606400,"11 13, 2010",2010,1830,"[""'You"", 'never', 'call', 'never', 'write', 'lament', 'probably', 'uttered', 'hundreds', 'times', 'day', 'world', 'exactly', 'situation', 'Mrs.', 'Palfrey', 'when', 'hotel-cum-retirement', 'home', 'Claremont', 'severe', 'change', 'pace', 'Palfrey', 'gamely', 'most', 'Meanwhile', 'told', 'residents', 'grandson', 'promised', 'visit', 'never', 'suspect', 'mysterious', 'grandson', 'just', 'figment', 'older', 'lady', 'imagination.A', 'chance', 'encounter', 'struggling', 'writer', 'visit', 'Claremont', 'where', 'can', 'get', 'nice', 'meal', 'nice', 'chat', 'Assumptions', 'are', 'made', 'Mrs.', 'Palfrey', 'long-rumored', 'grandson', 'rumor', 'Palfrey', 'nothing', 'dispel.Joan', 'Plowright', 'great', 'performance', 'long', 'distinguished', 'career', 'titular', 'role', 'times', 'bit', 'daft', 'mostly', 'just', 'sweet', 'bit', 'lonesome', 'Plowright', 'role', 'T.', 'audience', 'trouble', 'believing', 'be', 'exactly', 'whom', 'playing.Rupert', 'Friend', 'Ludovic', 'Meyer', 'down-on-his-luck', 'aspiring', 'writer', 'beautifully', 'fits', 'long-absent', 'grandson', 'bit', 'puzzled', 'first', 'true', 'affection', 'blooms', 'two', 'better', 'more', 'dutiful', 'relative', 'real', 'grandson', 'obviously', 'sweet', 'poignant', 'movie', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'mainly', 'performances', 'Plowright', 'Friend', 'also', 'bittersweet', 'tale', 'love', 'loss', 'worth', 'older', 'person', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'getting', 'around', 'had', 'rich', 'life', 'much', 'teach', 'younger', 'compatriots.Strongly', 'recommended', 'Appropriate', 'most', 'ages', 'probably', 'best', 'targeted', 'neglectful', 'children', 'grandchildren', 'who', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'make', 'time', 'who', 'sacrificed', 'so', 'much', 'raise']",Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont

I rented it from Netflix and I fell in love with it. The story is simple, and I suppose one could say it was perdictable, but that doesn't take away from the warm, well acted appeal of the film. There isn't any vulgarity, no sex and no violence. Maybe that's why the film never made a ""hit"" with film critics and movie goers. The widowed Mrs. Palfrey takes a little ""vacation"" for herself and makes reservations at an older hotel that (in its prime)was a high-class establishment.  Unfortunately, the years were not kind and it has become quite run down.  After taking such pains to make ""a good first impression"" with her appearance, Mrs. Palfrey finds herself a little out of her element. The permanent guests are an interesting assortment and a ""family"" atmosphere emerges. Mrs. Palfrey's family leaves something to be desired (her daughter is wrapped up in her own life, and her grandson isn't any better).

1008485,A1ULR1IIIW0ER4,B000GYI3PY,Thomas Randleman,"[6, 6]","Just when you think that most current films preach, frighten, annoy and frustrate with their subject matter, along comes what could be described as an old fashioned ""feel good"" film.Joan Plowwright has always grasped her characters with an intellence that ranges from bright humor to deeply felt human emotion.  One marvels at her ability to get into whatever role she is portraying and often rise above the material and in some cases her fellow actors.  She is wonderful to watch.Mrs. Plafrey at the Calremont reminds one of the wonderful stories one read as a child or young person with sharply defined characterizations and lovely exterior and interior scenes.  The interaction of the various characters mirrors life story elements which everyone can idenify with and be sympathetic with.  First, this is not a film which focuses a ""tied up with a ribbon"" story.  It covers the ambiguious nature of relationships and compels us to think about our own lives and how we react and respond to others in our lives.  Most importanly, it allows us to celebrate the magesty of caring, love and regard which makes life truly worth living.  A very refreshing element of this film is the beautifully balanced act the ensemble of actors perform.  Even though there are many well know Brit actors we have seen on Masterpiece Theatre and other British films who are first-rate in their own right, none trys to outdo or overshadow even in what might be termed ""cameo"" roles.

1008491,A3BGM84XBZ55JP,B000GYI3PY,WilF.,"[0, 0]","Great little film...and a great escape yet not too unrealistic in the sense that one day we may all face feeling a lonely displacement in old age when the people we once knew has moved or passed on and younger relatives seem to not have time for us anymore. Joan Plowright is spot on as a dignified senior who now lives at a retirement place of sorts. Each person has their own little room or compartment and while relationships between residents are brisk and shallow and definitely unexplored, Mrs. Palfrey is just around the corner from meeting a new friend from outside who begins to fill that gap. The actor who portrays her friend is devastatingly handsome btw!I enjoyed this movie quite a bit... though was left with what I usually feel of slightly quirky films; that I wish there were more 'enchanted aprils, Mrs. Palfreys, tea with mussolini and ladies in lavender' type people around to come together and to truly care about each other! It just seems so simple to do and yet the reality is, life isn't this charming! Which is why I guess these kind of movies engage the part of us who wishes life could be this way - more simple and straightforward.Another noticeable thing (and not to be a damper) in films like this is ...most of them depict characters who've some degree of financial security or even wealth. Unfortunately, especially in the US - many elderly do NOT possess enough income to live in these settings and must rely on family members, live in situations where they are isolated and without help and tend to live a much lesser quality of life. I wonder if in the U.K. the quality of life for seniors on limited incomes is better than here in the states???",4,When we are old and forgotten about...good things can happen!,1403136000,"06 19, 2014",2014,1680,"['Great', 'little', 'film', 'great', 'escape', 'yet', 'not', 'too', 'unrealistic', 'sense', 'one', 'day', 'may', 'face', 'feeling', 'lonely', 'displacement', 'old', 'age', 'when', 'people', 'once', 'knew', 'moved', 'passed', 'younger', 'relatives', 'seem', 'not', 'have', 'time', 'anymore', 'Joan', 'Plowright', 'spot', 'dignified', 'senior', 'who', 'now', 'retirement', 'place', 'sorts', 'person', 'own', 'little', 'room', 'compartment', 'relationships', 'residents', 'are', 'brisk', 'shallow', 'definitely', 'unexplored', 'Mrs.', 'Palfrey', 'just', 'corner', 'meeting', 'new', 'friend', 'who', 'fill', 'gap', 'actor', 'who', 'friend', 'devastatingly', 'handsome', 'btw', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'quite', 'bit', 'was', 'left', 'what', 'usually', 'feel', 'slightly', 'quirky', 'films', 'wish', 'were', 'more', ""'enchanted"", 'aprils', 'Mrs.', 'Palfreys', 'tea', 'mussolini', 'ladies', 'lavender', 'type', 'people', 'come', 'together', 'truly', 'care', 'other', 'just', 'so', 'simple', 'do', 'yet', 'reality', 'life', ""n't"", 'charming', 'Which', 'why', 'guess', 'kind', 'movies', 'engage', 'part', 'who', 'life', 'could', 'be', 'way', 'more', 'simple', 'straightforward.Another', 'noticeable', 'thing', 'not', 'be', 'damper', 'films', 'most', 'depict', 'characters', 'who', ""'ve"", 'degree', 'financial', 'security', 'even', 'wealth', 'Unfortunately', 'especially', 'US', 'many', 'elderly', 'do', 'NOT', 'possess', 'enough', 'income', 'live', 'settings', 'must', 'rely', 'family', 'members', 'live', 'situations', 'where', 'are', 'isolated', 'help', 'tend', 'live', 'much', 'lesser', 'quality', 'life', 'wonder', 'U.K.', 'quality', 'life', 'seniors', 'limited', 'incomes', 'better', 'here', 'states']",Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont
