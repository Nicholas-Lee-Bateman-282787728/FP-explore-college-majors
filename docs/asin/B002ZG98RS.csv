I also love that Pattinson's character is able to allow himself to be vulnerable with the girl that would become his girlfriend. They make love, but they are too young for this. I love that she has a caring father 'cause he reminds me of my dad. I also love that he has a friend, but unfortunately they are troubled and do self-destructive things. I don't like how he meets his girlfriend, but I love that they are able to patch things up. It's always nice when people forgive each other. I love that he bought her some food (if I remember correctly) from the restaurant that he and his brother went to on various occasions before he died. I thought Brosnan's character was convincing as his father and Pattison's character loved his sister, which is terrific. But I don't like how they used 9/11 as a reason for his death because it made a story that was already tragic, unnecessarily more tragic. I just think it was just too sad overall.

I can write decent reviews on music CDs but even if I watch a good movie, it's sometimes hard for me to put together a nice review on a movie for some reason.)ANYWAY,I'm sure there is nothing I could say new here, and even if some people already did, I won't put any major spoilers in this review....But I must write my short, short piece because I really enjoyed this movie.My favorite part of the movie was probably the actors and actresses. Most of them do an outstanding job. My favorite character is probably Tyler's eventual girlfriend, Allie, who at first plays hard-to-get. The two find each other after both dealing with a death in the family, and just trying to find their way through life.I also enjoyed Tyler's little sister a great deal. She was very smart and interesting and I felt so bad for her when she was picked on at times by the snotty little girls in her class.Although this movie isn't quite an uplifting one like I thought it'd be, and sometimes the plot seems a bit thrown together, it is still a good movie to see.

1309085,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B002ZG98RS,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 2]","I ask this question because the ending to `Remember Me' is so abrupt and unexpected that it threatens to reconstruct in my mind my entire viewing experience; in good and bad ways.  While the film is expertly paced and delicately directed, it has so many issues within its tightly woven web that I can't help but see the potential of what this film could have been, not what it actually became.  But then there is the ending, which changes the game entirely.First, the film's core itself is a budding romance between unlikely yet uniquely kindred spirits.  At the films gut-wrenching opening a young girl witnesses the senseless murder of her mother.  That young girl grows up to be the beautiful Ally, daughter to a rough-necked police officer who obvious hasn't moved on from the death of his wife.  Ally is introduced to a loner of sorts; the apathetic Tyler who has a tumultuous family life thanks to divorced parents, a deceased brother and a disinterested father.  Tyler is reclusive and aimless in life, simply sifting through life waiting for it to catch up with him.  After a run-in with Ally's father, Tyler takes up a bet to mess with the hotheaded police officer by taking his daughter out on a date, using her and abusing her, sending her home crying to daddy.  Tyler, of course, falls in love with her instead and then all bets are off.Think a darker, more graphic `She's All That' or something like that.Yeah, I kind of hate the dissolving into clich&eacute;d genre techniques that pollute good ideas.  That isn't to say that `Remember Me' is a `great idea', it's just a good one that could have been bolstered by staying away from generalities.  Why does there have to be a bet?  Why does she have to find out about it?  Why do they need to break up before they can make up?  Why does Robert Pattinson have to be such a bad actor?Wait, that is another complaint.Yes, the acting is marginally effective thanks to some major players dropping the ball.  Pattinson is a vacant actor.  One may say that is the character he plays, but NO, that is not true.  Someone can be apathetic and reclusive and still expressive in their eyes and Pattinson is not that kind of actor.  He's just there.  When he tries to express himself (the sarcasm, the frustration, the yelling) he comes off awkward and unnatural.  Another low point is Pierce Brosnan who suffers from a horribly uneven accent.  Chris Cooper broods well, but I'm still waiting for him to do something else with his career (he's regurgitated this character for the past decade and looks to repeat for this one) and Tate Ellington is funny but under developed as a character.  Ruby Jerins is super sweet and emotes well (I see a child star in the making there), but the only real standout acting comes from Emilie de Ravin, who manages to be interesting from scene to scene.I wanted to know her.And then we have the ending.I'm going to scream SPOILERS right now, but I do promise that I will NOT give away the ending or divulge too much information as to spoil the impact of the ending, but I can't talk about my feelings here without giving away at least a hinting, which could be considered by some a spoiler.Amidst all these clich&eacute;s we are given an ending that no one would have seen coming and one that took my breath away.  First of all, I must admit that I was becoming irritated with the ending because it seemed like a lazy way to tie up familial disagreements (little Caroline has a school debacle that everyone treats like the death of a loved one, complete with mourning; Tyler loses his poo and throws a fit that gets him arrested; father comes to rescue and everyone is happy again) and then BAM, I was hit with something that changed the whole ending in a way that I'm still confused over my actual feelings over.  In a way, it is the best thing about the film because it is so unexpected and so anti-generic.  On the other hand, it seems so out of place that it almost feels highly manipulative and insincere.  Like I said, I'm still trying to figure out what I think about the ending.One thing I will say about `Remember Me' that I respect, even if it can be seen as a deterant of sorts, is that it isn't afraid to be dark and unconventionally constructed.  Despite the fact that the love story angle is highly clich&eacute;d and the familial relationship is `been there done that', the dark surroundings and the fearless thrusts into violence and heartache (bookended tragedy as well as sporadic violent sequences) help make this film memorable and give it a slight edge.But it is just a slight edge, considering that the film is propelled by a mediocre lead `male' performance and restrained by familiar plot points that should have been stripped from the film to create something more honest and more admirable.",3,Can a films climax truly alter

1309088,A2D7B5I7ZQ51XL,B002ZG98RS,Anthony Pittore,"[6, 17]","In 'Remember Me,' Robert Pattinson ('Twilight') stars as Tyler Hawkins, a twentysomething in New York City confused about just about everything: life, love, family, etc. After a night of drinking, Tyler is arrested for breaking up a brawl and then assaulting a police officer. When Tyler's friend (Tate Ellington) spots the arresting officer's daughter Ally (Emilie de Ravin of 'Lost') at school, he dares Tyler to sleep with her as revenge. As time goes on, Tyler & Ally fall for one another amidst their separate family problems and issues with one another.When judging a film, it's only proper to judge the film as a whole. There are films like 'The Mist' where an overly dramatic ending was seemingly tacked on for effect to make up for a previous 90 minutes of mediocrity. Here, with 'Remember Me,' the tacked-on ending is one of the few things to actually dislike about the film. The original script from newcomer Will Fetters was, for the most part, very well written with solidly fleshed-out characters and believable dialogue. The cast brought the script to life very well with great performances by the typically forgettable Robert Pattinson and the oh-so-cute Emilie de Ravin, not to forget the always dependable Chris Cooper as Ravin's father. Allen Coulter, whose only other feature film in his 20+ year directing career was the mundane 'Hollywoodland,' does well capturing the extremely personal script while still managing to get a great grasp on the New York City setting. Regardless of all the great elements of this film, one item that will always hold it back from greatness to me and many others was the previously mentioned ending. For the first 100 or so minutes, we are given a bleak and sad film for pretty much every viewer. From lost love to family issues to that feeling of being ""lost"" in life, the film connects with many things we all deal with throughout or lives, and this is important to do in a personal film like this. Therefore, it seems unnecessary that a seemingly unrelated ""surprise"" ending needs to be thrown at us to exacerbate the depressing story. Once the finale is played out, the film completely changes the reason why we're sad to begin with, thus cheapening the meaning of the rest of the movie. I admit, I was emotionally affected like the many others who bawled their eyes out over 'Remember Me,' but that's more for the subject matter of the conclusion than for the actual relevance to the film. Regardless, if one can view the film and take the ending as just another reason to be weepy instead of being offended by it, 'Remember Me' can be a powerfully film for the right reasons. However, be sure to think of the film as a whole before passing any real judgments on it.Final Verdict: 7/10.-AP3-",3,A bleakly depressing romance with a nearly offensive conclusion,1271894400,"04 22, 2010",2010,2749,"[""'Remember"", 'Me', 'Robert', 'Pattinson', ""'Twilight"", 'stars', 'Tyler', 'Hawkins', 'twentysomething', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'confused', 'about', 'just', 'everything', 'life', 'love', 'family', 'etc', 'night', 'drinking', 'Tyler', 'arrested', 'breaking', 'up', 'brawl', 'then', 'assaulting', 'police', 'officer', 'When', 'Tyler', 'friend', 'Tate', 'Ellington', 'spots', 'arresting', 'officer', 'daughter', 'Ally', 'Emilie', 'de', 'Ravin', ""'Lost"", 'school', 'Tyler', 'sleep', 'revenge', 'time', 'Tyler', 'Ally', 'fall', 'one', 'amidst', 'separate', 'family', 'problems', 'issues', 'one', 'another.When', 'judging', 'film', 'only', 'proper', 'judge', 'film', 'whole', 'are', 'films', ""'The"", 'Mist', 'where', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'ending', 'was', 'seemingly', 'tacked', 'effect', 'make', 'up', 'previous', '90', 'minutes', 'mediocrity', 'Here', ""'Remember"", 'Me', 'tacked-on', 'ending', 'one', 'few', 'things', 'actually', 'dislike', 'film', 'original', 'script', 'newcomer', 'Will', 'Fetters', 'was', 'most', 'part', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'solidly', 'fleshed-out', 'characters', 'believable', 'dialogue', 'cast', 'brought', 'script', 'life', 'very', 'well', 'great', 'performances', 'typically', 'forgettable', 'Robert', 'Pattinson', 'oh-so-cute', 'Emilie', 'de', 'Ravin', 'not', 'forget', 'always', 'dependable', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'Ravin', 'father', 'Allen', 'Coulter', 'only', 'other', 'feature', 'film', '20+', 'year', 'directing', 'career', 'was', 'mundane', ""'Hollywoodland"", 'well', 'capturing', 'extremely', 'personal', 'script', 'still', 'managing', 'get', 'great', 'grasp', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'setting', 'Regardless', 'great', 'elements', 'film', 'one', 'item', 'will', 'always', 'hold', 'back', 'greatness', 'many', 'others', 'was', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'ending', 'first', '100', 'so', 'minutes', 'are', 'given', 'bleak', 'sad', 'film', 'pretty', 'much', 'viewer', 'lost', 'love', 'family', 'issues', 'feeling', 'being', 'lost', 'life', 'film', 'connects', 'many', 'things', 'deal', 'lives', 'important', 'do', 'personal', 'film', 'Therefore', 'unnecessary', 'seemingly', 'unrelated', 'surprise', 'ending', 'needs', 'be', 'thrown', 'exacerbate', 'depressing', 'story', 'finale', 'played', 'out', 'film', 'completely', 'reason', 'why', ""'re"", 'sad', 'begin', 'thus', 'cheapening', 'meaning', 'rest', 'movie', 'admit', 'was', 'emotionally', 'affected', 'many', 'others', 'who', 'bawled', 'eyes', 'out', ""'Remember"", 'Me', 'more', 'subject', 'matter', 'conclusion', 'actual', 'relevance', 'film', 'Regardless', 'one', 'can', 'view', 'film', 'take', 'ending', 'as', 'just', 'reason', 'be', 'weepy', 'instead', 'being', 'offended', ""'Remember"", 'Me', 'can', 'be', 'powerfully', 'film', 'right', 'reasons', 'However', 'be', 'sure', 'think', 'film', 'whole', 'passing', 'real', 'judgments', 'it.Final', 'Verdict', '7/10.-AP3-']",N/A

1309092,A30TQET02FLSUX,B002ZG98RS,BLACKBOXBLUE,"[14, 17]","For whatever reason, it seems that it's rare now that a movie completely shocks or blows me away with a twist in the story. Maybe I'm just old enough and have seen enough movies that the stories aren't as ""new"" to me. Maybe it's the writing in current movies, i.e. it's not very creative but more ""reality"" based. All I know is that Remember Me (2010) blew me away with its twist ending when I saw it recently on DVD from Redbox. I'm surprised I didn't see it coming, because now, looking back on it, it seems like the clues were there all along. I'm not going to give away the ending, because that's what elevates this movie from average (2.5 to 3.0 stars) to good (3.5 stars out of 5) in my opinion. It's exciting to see a movie completely elevate its emotional connection so powerfully and abruptly in just a few minutes at the end. That's what Director Allen Coulter did with this story from fresh new screenwriter Will Fetters. And the timing and relevance of the story feels just right.It's kind of hard for me to even talk about the movie without giving away the ending, so I'll simply say that the first 3/4 of the movie is decent, even though it lingers a little and feels like it's going nowhere at times. But the ending makes it all worth it. In today's wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am culture, I know it's hard for classic movie foreplay to appeal to people. I try to give a movie or tv show a chance to build up and pay off, but sometimes even I can't wait too long. We've all gotten so accustomed to quick emotional or technological payoffs that we are like crack addicts waiting for the hit. I'm not sure that Robert Pattinson was the right choice for the lead character Tyler, but the movie is good despite him. Pattinson seems a little too dramatic and over the top in his acting, but he's not bad either. I can't say I'm a fan of his work since I haven't seen any of the Twilight movies or anything else he's done. His role in Remember Me might have been better in the hands of another actor, but I can't think of who at this point. I just know he won't be receiving any Oscar nominations for this movie. But it was a step in the right direction for his career. Maybe with a second viewing I'll feel differently about him.Like so many recent movies I've seen, I can't help but notice the high quality of the production design and photography. Both are top notch, even thought they don't jump out at you. That's the beauty sometimes of great design and photography...they don't call attention to themselves because you just immerse yourself in the movie and its story. The production design make the crappy apartment that Tyler lives in seem ""real"" and believable within New York City. It adds to the emotional feelings within the movie, showing the contrasts between the good and the bad in the city and life. There's a great supporting cast of actors, including Chris Cooper, Pierce Brosnan, and Lena Olin. Pattinson's love interest Ally is played by Emilie de Ravin of Lost fame, and she is just like Pattinson...neither great nor bad, but par for the course. I definitely recommend watching Remember Me...all the way through to the end.",3,Shocking Ending,1286236800,"10 5, 2010",2010,3150,"['reason', 'rare', 'now', 'movie', 'completely', 'away', 'twist', 'story', 'Maybe', ""'m"", 'just', 'old', 'enough', 'have', 'seen', 'enough', 'movies', 'stories', 'are', ""n't"", 'new', 'Maybe', 'writing', 'current', 'movies', 'i.e', 'not', 'very', 'creative', 'more', 'reality', 'based', 'know', 'Remember', 'Me', '2010', 'blew', 'away', 'twist', 'ending', 'when', 'saw', 'recently', 'DVD', 'Redbox', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'because', 'now', 'looking', 'back', 'clues', 'were', 'there', 'all', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'give', 'away', 'ending', 'what', 'movie', 'average', '2.5', '3.0', 'stars', 'good', '3.5', 'stars', '5', 'opinion', 'exciting', 'see', 'movie', 'completely', 'elevate', 'emotional', 'connection', 'so', 'powerfully', 'abruptly', 'just', 'few', 'minutes', 'end', 'what', 'Director', 'Allen', 'Coulter', 'did', 'story', 'fresh', 'new', 'screenwriter', 'Will', 'Fetters', 'timing', 'relevance', 'story', 'feels', 'just', 'right.It', 'kind', 'hard', 'even', 'talk', 'movie', 'giving', 'away', 'ending', ""'ll"", 'simply', 'say', 'first', '3/4', 'movie', 'decent', 'even', 'little', 'feels', 'going', 'nowhere', 'times', 'ending', 'today', ""wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am"", 'culture', 'know', 'hard', 'classic', 'movie', 'foreplay', 'appeal', 'people', 'try', 'give', 'movie', 'tv', 'show', 'chance', 'build', 'up', 'pay', 'off', 'sometimes', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'too', 'long', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'so', 'accustomed', 'quick', 'emotional', 'technological', 'payoffs', 'are', 'like', 'crack', 'addicts', 'waiting', 'hit', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'Robert', 'Pattinson', 'was', 'right', 'choice', 'lead', 'character', 'Tyler', 'movie', 'good', 'Pattinson', 'little', 'too', 'dramatic', 'top', 'acting', 'not', 'bad', 'either', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', ""'m"", 'fan', 'work', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Twilight', 'movies', 'anything', 'else', 'done', 'role', 'Remember', 'Me', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'hands', 'actor', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'who', 'point', 'just', 'know', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'receiving', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'movie', 'was', 'step', 'right', 'direction', 'career', 'Maybe', 'second', 'viewing', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'differently', 'him.Like', 'so', 'many', 'recent', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'notice', 'high', 'quality', 'production', 'design', 'photography', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'even', 'thought', 'do', ""n't"", 'jump', 'out', 'beauty', 'sometimes', 'great', 'design', 'photography', 'do', ""n't"", 'call', 'attention', 'just', 'immerse', 'movie', 'story', 'production', 'design', 'make', 'crappy', 'apartment', 'Tyler', 'seem', 'real', 'believable', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'emotional', 'feelings', 'movie', 'showing', 'contrasts', 'good', 'bad', 'city', 'life', 'great', 'supporting', 'cast', 'actors', 'including', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'Lena', 'Olin', 'Pattinson', 'love', 'interest', 'Ally', 'played', 'Emilie', 'de', 'Ravin', 'Lost', 'fame', 'just', 'Pattinson', 'neither', 'great', 'bad', 'par', 'course', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'watching', 'Remember', 'Me', 'way', 'end']",N/A

1309095,A2LLWO2030A41A,B002ZG98RS,Brittany,"[24, 24]","*Definite, major spoilers*I hate tear-jerkers. I hate romances. I hate movies about people who have troubled pasts. I hate character deaths. I hate portrayals of drunken cops who take the law a little too far and people with anger management issues.  So even though I like Robert Pattinson and Emilie de Ravin, I figured I would come out hating this movie. Only I didn't, and to say I didn't is a major understatement.  I will say that only three movies have made me tear up, and this is one of them. It's funny because no matter how hard I try to ""type"" it -- Is it ""just"" a tear-jerker? Is it ""just"" another typical romance, albeit with a twist ending?--- I can't. And you know, I really don't care anymore. I think any movie that can make you feel the way this movie made me feel stands on its own.  Because okay, I have about 40+ DVDS in my personal collection.  I can pop in any one of them and watch it and feel almost nothing.  I enjoy what I'm watching, sure, but after it's over I can go back and wash the dishes or feed my dog or whatever, and never think about it again that day, or any day, really, until I'm ready to watch it again.But Remember Me? People talk a lot about the ending, and yeah, I suppose that's what makes it so unforgettable. And I also suppose that's what turns some people off: they see it as exploitation. Personally I think that's ridiculous -- if you really wanted to argue the point further, you'd have to consider all war movies and portrayals of natural disasters exploitive.  Maybe it hits a little hard only 9 years later, when so many families are still grieving and we get televised reminders every year. But to anyone who considers the ending out of place with the whole film -- ""But they've just fallen in love!"" you might say. ""What's the point of showing this? And why THIS? Exploitation!"" Well, I'm not a screenwriter, but I thought I could see ""why this:"" Nobody ever said this was a romantic comedy.  There's no rule saying that every movie has to follow the formula romance. It doesn't work out that way statistically, anyway. People die.  They die in national tragedies. 911 was sudden and I'm sure none of the people in those buildings expected to die when they woke up that morning.The thing is, life isn't automatically tied up in a neat little package when we die. In many cases victims of tragedies are young.  They have emotional problems. They've recently fallen in love. If you didn't see the ending coming, well, you're not really supposed to, are you? The only real clue is that it's set in 2001, and I barely pay attention to dates on the screen, anyway. It's sudden because 911 was sudden. The romantic plot doesn't lead up to the ending because that's how it is in reality for many couples separated by death. I can't see it as exploitation because it's so very real, it's so very possible, and it's so very meaningful.  If Tyler had died any other way, would the film have had the same impact? No, I don't think so.  Because when you focus on this particular tragedy, and one particular character who is involved in it, that character beecomes a symbol for other lives lost. You end up not only feeling tremendously for the character of Tyler, but in watching grief in the aftermath of his death played out on-screen, the entire weight of the tragedy hits you all over again.I was in 4th grade when 911 happened.  At the time I had no clue what it all meant or what I was supposed to feel. It is only in the past two or three years or so, in watching a documentary about the event (Possibly called Flight 93? I'm not sure of the exact name.) and watching video tributes to the 911 victims that any of it really hit home for me. This was real. This happened in our country less than ten years ago and it's still affecting us. And finally I watched Remember Me... Besides the realistic acting and the sympathetic and complex characters, and yes, the execution of the plot as a whole, I found the title nearly perfect as well: ""Remember Me."" Not ""Remember 911."" Because if you forget that every tragedy has a deeply personal aspect, you're missing something important.  So in summary, I say it's not an exploitation, but a tribute.  And it's a great movie to boot, so you really can't go wrong.  I wouldn't watch it if you're feeling depressed, though: I literally cried for about a half-hour afterward and before I watched it I felt perfectly normal. But like I said: any movie that can grab you like that is definitely worth watching.",5,Wow...Just wow...,1281225600,"08 8, 2010",2010,4499,"['*Definite', 'major', 'spoilers*I', 'hate', 'tear-jerkers', 'hate', 'romances', 'hate', 'movies', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'troubled', 'pasts', 'hate', 'character', 'deaths', 'hate', 'portrayals', 'drunken', 'cops', 'who', 'take', 'law', 'little', 'too', 'far', 'people', 'anger', 'management', 'issues', 'So', 'even', 'like', 'Robert', 'Pattinson', 'Emilie', 'de', 'Ravin', 'figured', 'would', 'come', 'out', 'hating', 'movie', 'Only', 'did', ""n't"", 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'major', 'understatement', 'will', 'say', 'only', 'three', 'movies', 'have', 'made', 'tear', 'up', 'one', 'funny', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'try', 'type', 'just', 'tear-jerker', 'just', 'typical', 'romance', 'twist', 'ending', 'ca', ""n't"", 'know', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'anymore', 'think', 'movie', 'can', 'make', 'feel', 'way', 'movie', 'made', 'feel', 'stands', 'own', 'okay', 'have', '40+', 'DVDS', 'personal', 'collection', 'can', 'pop', 'one', 'watch', 'feel', 'almost', 'nothing', 'enjoy', 'what', ""'m"", 'watching', 'sure', 'can', 'go', 'back', 'dishes', 'feed', 'dog', 'whatever', 'never', 'think', 'again', 'day', 'day', 'really', ""'m"", 'ready', 'watch', 'again.But', 'Remember', 'Me', 'People', 'talk', 'lot', 'ending', 'yeah', 'suppose', 'what', 'so', 'unforgettable', 'also', 'suppose', 'what', 'people', 'see', 'exploitation', 'Personally', 'think', 'ridiculous', 'really', 'wanted', 'argue', 'point', 'further', ""'d"", 'have', 'consider', 'war', 'movies', 'portrayals', 'natural', 'disasters', 'exploitive', 'Maybe', 'little', 'hard', 'only', '9', 'years', 'later', 'when', 'so', 'many', 'families', 'are', 'still', 'grieving', 'get', 'televised', 'reminders', 'year', 'anyone', 'who', 'ending', 'place', 'whole', 'film', ""'ve"", 'just', 'fallen', 'love', 'might', 'say', 'What', 'point', 'showing', 'why', 'THIS', 'Exploitation', 'Well', ""'m"", 'not', 'screenwriter', 'thought', 'could', 'see', 'why', 'Nobody', 'ever', 'said', 'was', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'rule', 'saying', 'movie', 'follow', 'formula', 'romance', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'way', 'statistically', 'anyway', 'People', 'die', 'die', 'national', 'tragedies', '911', 'was', 'sudden', ""'m"", 'sure', 'none', 'people', 'buildings', 'expected', 'die', 'when', 'woke', 'up', 'morning.The', 'thing', 'life', ""n't"", 'automatically', 'tied', 'up', 'neat', 'little', 'package', 'when', 'die', 'many', 'cases', 'victims', 'tragedies', 'are', 'young', 'have', 'emotional', 'problems', ""'ve"", 'recently', 'fallen', 'love', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'ending', 'coming', 'well', ""'re"", 'not', 'really', 'supposed', 'are', 'only', 'real', 'clue', 'set', '2001', 'barely', 'pay', 'attention', 'dates', 'screen', 'anyway', 'sudden', '911', 'was', 'sudden', 'romantic', 'plot', ""n't"", 'lead', 'up', 'ending', 'how', 'reality', 'many', 'couples', 'separated', 'death', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'exploitation', 'so', 'very', 'real', 'so', 'very', 'possible', 'so', 'very', 'meaningful', 'Tyler', 'had', 'died', 'other', 'way', 'would', 'film', 'have', 'had', 'same', 'impact', 'No', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'when', 'focus', 'particular', 'tragedy', 'one', 'particular', 'character', 'who', 'involved', 'character', 'symbol', 'other', 'lives', 'lost', 'end', 'up', 'not', 'only', 'feeling', 'tremendously', 'character', 'Tyler', 'watching', 'grief', 'aftermath', 'death', 'played', 'out', 'on-screen', 'entire', 'weight', 'tragedy', 'again.I', 'was', '4th', 'grade', 'when', '911', 'happened', 'time', 'had', 'clue', 'what', 'meant', 'what', 'was', 'supposed', 'feel', 'only', 'past', 'two', 'three', 'years', 'so', 'watching', 'documentary', 'event', 'Possibly', 'called', 'Flight', '93', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'exact', 'name', 'watching', 'video', 'tributes', '911', 'victims', 'really', 'hit', 'home', 'was', 'real', 'happened', 'country', 'less', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'still', 'affecting', 'finally', 'watched', 'Remember', 'Me', 'realistic', 'acting', 'sympathetic', 'complex', 'characters', 'yes', 'execution', 'plot', 'whole', 'found', 'title', 'nearly', 'perfect', 'well', 'Remember', 'Me', 'Not', 'Remember', '911', 'forget', 'tragedy', 'deeply', 'personal', 'aspect', ""'re"", 'missing', 'something', 'important', 'So', 'summary', 'say', 'not', 'exploitation', 'tribute', 'great', 'movie', 'boot', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'would', ""n't"", 'watch', ""'re"", 'feeling', 'depressed', 'literally', 'cried', 'half-hour', 'afterward', 'watched', 'felt', 'perfectly', 'normal', 'said', 'movie', 'can', 'grab', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A

1309104,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B002ZG98RS,Chris Pandolfi,"[10, 16]","A title like ""Remember Me"" is automatically mysterious. Who is making that statement? Who is it directed at? Why is it being made? It is something a character is requesting, or is it actually a theme that carries all throughout? Is it both? I wouldn't be asking these questions if it weren't for the ending of this film, which, I admit, I have no idea how to feel about. I do know that it will divide audiences. Some will see it as powerful while others will see it as emotionally manipulative, perhaps even offensive. Everyone will agree that it comes completely out of left field. At least, it might seem that way at first; I too was caught off guard, but as I thought back on how the film progressed, I quickly realized that hints - some of them not at all subtle - were being given to us.All I can say with certainty is that everything leading up to the ending is enjoyable, if a little routine. The main character is Tyler Hawkins (Robert Pattinson), a moody, rebellious, bitter twenty-one year on the verge of turning twenty-two. Is this something to celebrate? Not with the life he has leading. He lives in a dingy New York apartment. He takes all his college classes on an auditing basis. He has no prospects. He picks fights with the wrong people. He smokes too much. He often lands in jail. He hates his father, Charles (Pierce Brosnan), whose cold, distant workaholic tendencies may have played a part in the suicide of Michael, Tyler's brother. Michael, of course, was only twenty-two years old.In due time, Tyler starts dating a college student named Ally Craig (Emilie de Ravin), who has her own emotional baggage to contend with. Part of it stems from her father, an NYPD officer named Neil (Chris Cooper), a broken man who we know is decent deep down. He's immensely overprotective of Ally. Why? He has his reasons, other than the fact that he's her father. If she forgets to call home after just one night away, he'll call everyone he knows down at his precinct and demand they help track her down. If he had his way, she wouldn't have a boyfriend, nor would she be allowed to grow up. Be that as it may, Tyler and Ally really do seem to have a good thing going, despite the fact that it all started under false pretenses.Meanwhile, Tyler remains devoted to his eleven-year-old sister, Caroline (Ruby Jerins), a gifted artist who has a tendency to space out in the middle of class. She's often made fun of. Eventually, she learns just how mean other kids can be. This generates even more friction between Tyler and his father, who frequently thinks business meetings are more important than family gatherings, specifically an art show Caroline was lucky enough to be a part of. But is Charles really the hard-hearted monster he seems to be? Or is he still grieving the death of his other son? Tragedy can make us do things we ordinarily wouldn't do. For Charles, overworking might be easier than actually allowing himself to feel. All he knows is that he more than adequately provides for his family, financially speaking. And Tyler? He has no responsibilities at all. How can he when he believes that life ends at age twenty-two?While hardly groundbreaking in terms of story, ""Remember Me"" does have emotional resonance. It helps that the performances are strong. I responded best to the scenes featuring Pattinson and Jerins; all too often, the chemistry between child actors and adult actors is overlooked, and this is a shame because it's sometimes the most believable aspect of a film. This isn't to suggest that there isn't chemistry between the adults. Indeed, Pattinson and de Ravin are always charming, humorous, and poignant whenever they appear together. And Pattinson and Brosnon are convincing as a quarrelling father and son. The only casting choice I question is Tate Ellington, although it had nothing to do with his performance; his character - Aiden Hall, Tyler's roommate - was completely unnecessary, and, quite frankly, annoying.I've now established that this movie opens on a good but unoriginal premise. This brings me back to what I started this review with: The ending. Was it earned? Honestly, I have no idea. On the one hand, it's a contrived scene that's in service of an already contrived plot, which is more than a little unfair. On the other hand, it depicts a very real event, and it correctly reinforces the idea that it's pointless to put all your energy into hating those closest to you. Both are equally valid points. Ultimately, I can recommend ""Remember Me"" only on the basis of its opening and middle sections, which were well done in spite of a very traditional premise. As far as the ending is concerned, I'm afraid you're on your own. Hopefully, I'll be able to make up my mind the next time around.",4,Endings Have a Funny Way of Sneaking Up on You,1268352000,"03 12, 2010",2010,4758,"['title', 'Remember', 'Me', 'automatically', 'mysterious', 'Who', 'making', 'statement', 'Who', 'directed', 'Why', 'being', 'made', 'something', 'character', 'requesting', 'actually', 'theme', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'asking', 'questions', 'were', ""n't"", 'ending', 'film', 'admit', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'feel', 'do', 'know', 'will', 'divide', 'audiences', 'will', 'see', 'powerful', 'others', 'will', 'see', 'emotionally', 'manipulative', 'perhaps', 'even', 'offensive', 'Everyone', 'will', 'agree', 'completely', 'left', 'field', 'least', 'might', 'seem', 'way', 'first', 'too', 'was', 'caught', 'off', 'guard', 'thought', 'back', 'how', 'film', 'progressed', 'quickly', 'realized', 'hints', 'not', 'subtle', 'were', 'being', 'given', 'us.All', 'can', 'say', 'certainty', 'everything', 'leading', 'up', 'ending', 'enjoyable', 'little', 'routine', 'main', 'character', 'Tyler', 'Hawkins', 'Robert', 'Pattinson', 'moody', 'rebellious', 'bitter', 'twenty-one', 'year', 'verge', 'turning', 'twenty-two', 'something', 'celebrate', 'Not', 'life', 'leading', 'dingy', 'New', 'York', 'apartment', 'college', 'classes', 'auditing', 'basis', 'prospects', 'fights', 'wrong', 'people', 'too', 'much', 'often', 'jail', 'father', 'Charles', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'cold', 'distant', 'workaholic', 'tendencies', 'may', 'have', 'played', 'part', 'suicide', 'Michael', 'Tyler', 'brother', 'Michael', 'course', 'was', 'only', 'twenty-two', 'years', 'due', 'time', 'Tyler', 'dating', 'college', 'student', 'named', 'Ally', 'Craig', 'Emilie', 'de', 'Ravin', 'who', 'own', 'emotional', 'baggage', 'contend', 'Part', 'father', 'NYPD', 'officer', 'named', 'Neil', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'broken', 'man', 'who', 'know', 'decent', 'deep', 'down', 'immensely', 'overprotective', 'Ally', 'Why', 'reasons', 'other', 'fact', 'father', 'call', 'home', 'just', 'one', 'night', 'away', ""'ll"", 'call', 'everyone', 'down', 'precinct', 'demand', 'help', 'track', 'down', 'had', 'way', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'boyfriend', 'would', 'be', 'allowed', 'grow', 'up', 'Be', 'may', 'Tyler', 'Ally', 'really', 'do', 'seem', 'have', 'good', 'thing', 'going', 'fact', 'started', 'false', 'pretenses.Meanwhile', 'Tyler', 'devoted', 'eleven-year-old', 'sister', 'Caroline', 'Ruby', 'Jerins', 'gifted', 'artist', 'who', 'tendency', 'space', 'out', 'middle', 'class', 'often', 'made', 'fun', 'Eventually', 'just', 'how', 'mean', 'other', 'kids', 'can', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'friction', 'Tyler', 'father', 'who', 'frequently', 'business', 'meetings', 'are', 'more', 'important', 'family', 'gatherings', 'specifically', 'art', 'show', 'Caroline', 'was', 'lucky', 'enough', 'be', 'part', 'Charles', 'really', 'hard-hearted', 'monster', 'be', 'still', 'grieving', 'death', 'other', 'son', 'Tragedy', 'can', 'make', 'do', 'things', 'ordinarily', 'would', ""n't"", 'do', 'Charles', 'overworking', 'might', 'be', 'easier', 'actually', 'allowing', 'feel', 'more', 'adequately', 'family', 'financially', 'speaking', 'Tyler', 'responsibilities', 'How', 'can', 'when', 'life', 'ends', 'age', 'twenty-two', 'hardly', 'groundbreaking', 'terms', 'story', 'Remember', 'Me', 'have', 'emotional', 'resonance', 'performances', 'are', 'strong', 'responded', 'best', 'scenes', 'featuring', 'Pattinson', 'Jerins', 'too', 'often', 'chemistry', 'child', 'actors', 'adult', 'actors', 'overlooked', 'shame', 'sometimes', 'most', 'believable', 'aspect', 'film', ""n't"", 'suggest', ""n't"", 'chemistry', 'adults', 'Indeed', 'Pattinson', 'de', 'Ravin', 'are', 'always', 'charming', 'humorous', 'poignant', 'whenever', 'appear', 'together', 'Pattinson', 'Brosnon', 'are', 'convincing', 'quarrelling', 'father', 'son', 'only', 'casting', 'choice', 'question', 'Tate', 'Ellington', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'performance', 'character', 'Aiden', 'Hall', 'Tyler', 'roommate', 'was', 'completely', 'unnecessary', 'quite', 'frankly', 'annoying.I', ""'ve"", 'now', 'established', 'movie', 'good', 'unoriginal', 'premise', 'back', 'what', 'started', 'review', 'ending', 'Was', 'earned', 'Honestly', 'have', 'idea', 'one', 'hand', 'contrived', 'scene', 'service', 'already', 'contrived', 'plot', 'more', 'little', 'unfair', 'other', 'hand', 'very', 'real', 'event', 'correctly', 'idea', 'pointless', 'put', 'energy', 'hating', 'closest', 'are', 'equally', 'valid', 'points', 'Ultimately', 'can', 'recommend', 'Remember', 'Me', 'only', 'basis', 'opening', 'middle', 'sections', 'were', 'well', 'done', 'spite', 'very', 'traditional', 'premise', 'As', 'far', 'ending', 'concerned', ""'m"", 'afraid', ""'re"", 'own', 'Hopefully', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'make', 'up', 'next', 'time', 'around']",N/A

However, to call this movie merely a ""love story"" does not do it justice. This is a heartwrenching tale of love, loss, suffering, friendship, and so much more.I have never watched a movie that resonated with me so much, even after the movie was over. Not only is the storyline compelling, but also, the acting in the movie is exemplary. In particular, the performances of Robert Pattinson, Emilie de Ravin, Ruby Jerins, and Tate Ellington deserve recognition.As the lead in the film, Robert Pattinson more than proves that he can act outside of the Twilight Saga. In fact, in my opinion, this is his greatest film to date. He completely embodies the character of Tyler Hawkins, pulling you along on an emotional journey that will bring you from laughter to tears. The ability to truly make you feel what a character is feeling is an amazing feat, but Pattinson does just that. The chemistry between he and Emilie de Ravin is apparent and helps to really drive the story home.Ruby Jerins portrays Caroline Hawkins, little sister to Pattinson's character in the film.

Some examples: the a**hole roommate, eating dessert first, being goaded to ""pick up"" a woman, and sappy melodramatic music (sometimes it almost drowns out the dialogue). I think the writers/producers involved with this film are perhaps too young to realize that these gimmicks are hackneyed, and their earnestness in the extra features sections of the DVD seem to bear this out.

I was not in a rush to see this movie (due to RP/Twilight overload), but it came out so close to Eclipse that my interest was peaked because I figured RP would take the chance  to break from the Twilight atmosphere. Needless to say, he didn't. His Tyler was another moody guy who fell in love w/another moody girl. I didn't see the character as much of a stretch from his Edward roles. I went into this movie w/o any bias (not a Twilight fan, but not a 100% hater...yet), but after maybe 30 mins, I started getting Twilight-esque vibes (the angsty stuff) about the direction of the story. I also found myself getting bored, so I went ahead and read the plot summary on Wiki. It turned out to be a pretty standard angst teen/tween movie.Now...about the ending. This is where the sucker punch came in. I'd heard months ago about the end, so I wasn't surprised, but just imagine if you were ignorant to where they were going. There's no real indication of time in the movie up until mere moments before the ""twist"" occurs. I guess this was the writer's way of trying to make the film relevant or ""worth"" more than it really is, but it just seemed cheap. The cryptic music, the teacher walking past the board w/that Tuesday's date, finding out his brother died in '95 and he'd be 28 that year, and the worst of all...Tyler staring out the window and the fade out shows that he's near the top of one of the Twin Towers. A stronger movie would not have needed to do that to invoke emotion. It almost seemed tacked on. I am not one who believes that the TT should be edited from movies and tv shows (we shouldn't act as though they never existed), but I really hope that if other movies decide to go back in time to reference 9/11 that they do a better job. If it was a ""twist"" in the vein of City of Angels, it would have been fine, but this one seemed over the top.I mentioned that I now appreciate ""Titanic"" more bc although that movie was primarily a romance, the tragedy of the Titanic's voyage was always there. Obviously history is not about spoilers, so you knew in the movie what they were in for. It never felt cheap or exploitive. The tragedy was not tacked on, or treated as simplistic as in RM. The acting was light years better also. I read that the writer of Remember Me had 9/11 in mind when it was written, and that's all well and good, but this is a movie. Of course those 3,000 Americans went about their normal routine, but here in this film, it was as though the inclusion (intentions aside) was designed for an instant reaction from the audience.I had low expectations, so I would not say I was disappointed...but it's not deserving of more than three stars.",3,"A bit of a sucker punch and I've got a new appreciation for ""Titanic""... spoilers included",1287360000,"10 18, 2010",2010,2753,"['probably', 'term', 'may', 'find', 'several', 'reviews', 'here', 'elsewhere', 'was', 'not', 'rush', 'see', 'movie', 'due', 'RP/Twilight', 'overload', 'came', 'out', 'so', 'close', 'Eclipse', 'interest', 'was', 'peaked', 'figured', 'RP', 'would', 'take', 'chance', 'break', 'Twilight', 'atmosphere', 'Needless', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'Tyler', 'was', 'moody', 'guy', 'who', 'fell', 'love', 'w/another', 'moody', 'girl', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'character', 'much', 'stretch', 'Edward', 'went', 'movie', 'bias', 'not', 'Twilight', 'fan', 'not', '100', '%', 'hater', 'yet', 'maybe', '30', 'mins', 'started', 'getting', 'Twilight-esque', 'vibes', 'angsty', 'stuff', 'direction', 'story', 'also', 'found', 'getting', 'bored', 'went', 'ahead', 'read', 'plot', 'summary', 'Wiki', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'pretty', 'standard', 'angst', 'teen/tween', 'movie.Now', 'ending', 'where', 'sucker', 'punch', 'came', ""'d"", 'heard', 'months', 'end', 'was', ""n't"", 'surprised', 'just', 'imagine', 'were', 'ignorant', 'where', 'were', 'going', 'real', 'indication', 'time', 'movie', 'up', 'mere', 'moments', 'twist', 'guess', 'was', 'writer', 'way', 'trying', 'make', 'film', 'relevant', 'worth', 'more', 'really', 'just', 'seemed', 'cheap', 'cryptic', 'music', 'teacher', 'walking', 'board', 'w/that', 'Tuesday', 'date', 'finding', 'out', 'brother', 'died', ""'95"", ""'d"", 'be', '28', 'year', 'worst', 'Tyler', 'staring', 'out', 'window', 'fade', 'out', 'shows', 'top', 'one', 'Twin', 'Towers', 'A', 'stronger', 'movie', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'needed', 'do', 'invoke', 'emotion', 'almost', 'seemed', 'tacked', 'am', 'not', 'one', 'who', 'TT', 'should', 'be', 'edited', 'movies', 'tv', 'shows', 'should', ""n't"", 'act', 'never', 'existed', 'really', 'hope', 'other', 'movies', 'decide', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'reference', '9/11', 'do', 'better', 'job', 'was', 'twist', 'vein', 'City', 'Angels', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fine', 'one', 'seemed', 'top.I', 'mentioned', 'now', 'appreciate', 'Titanic', 'more', 'bc', 'movie', 'was', 'primarily', 'romance', 'tragedy', 'Titanic', 'voyage', 'was', 'always', 'there', 'Obviously', 'history', 'not', 'spoilers', 'knew', 'movie', 'what', 'were', 'never', 'felt', 'cheap', 'exploitive', 'tragedy', 'was', 'not', 'tacked', 'treated', 'as', 'simplistic', 'RM', 'acting', 'was', 'light', 'years', 'better', 'also', 'read', 'writer', 'Remember', 'Me', 'had', '9/11', 'mind', 'when', 'was', 'written', 'well', 'good', 'movie', 'course', '3,000', 'Americans', 'went', 'normal', 'routine', 'here', 'film', 'was', 'inclusion', 'intentions', 'aside', 'was', 'designed', 'instant', 'reaction', 'audience.I', 'had', 'low', 'expectations', 'would', 'not', 'say', 'was', 'disappointed', 'not', 'deserving', 'more', 'three', 'stars']",N/A

Writer Will Fetters has created a story that will likely remained married to the memories of everyone who views this film - such is the impact and lessons of the last moments of the movie.  Director Allen Coulter has gathered a fine cast of actors who are able to translate this lesson in facing death with a great deal of credibility and aplomb.As the film opens in 1991 in New York's subway a mother and child await their train: the mother is played by Martha Plimpton, the daughter Alyssa by Caitlyn Rund.  In a senseless situation the mother is murdered by ruffians, observed by Alyssa and promptly the father, police Sgt Craig (Chris Cooper), arrives on the scene to take his terrified daughter home.  Jump forward  10 years and we meet disshelved Tyler Hawkins (Robert Pattinson) and his alcoholic roommate Aidan (Tate Ellington) who after a bar brawl are taken to jail by none other than Sgt Craig. Tyler's distant  father is the wealthy Charles Hawkins (Pierce Brosnan) who bails them out of jail.  Aidan suggests revenge at the beating they received from Sgt Craig in the form of having Tyler date and dump Craig's daughter Alyssa (now Emilie de Ravin).  The two meet, spar, and fall in love in a genuine way: Tyler confesses to Alyssa his dark memory of seeing his brother hang himself and Alyssa shares being present when her mother was murdered.  Tyler's only connection with his family now is his devotion to his eleven-year-old sister Caroline (Ruby Jerins) and his now divorced mother (Lena Olin).  Through a series of unhappy incidents the story moves from coping with past memories of death and the consequences of the impact on each of the characters of the film.  And just when it looks as though the film may have a happy an unexpected trauma occurs - one that changes the lies of every character.The cast is excellent down to the smallest role. The lighting and music and cinematography are all first rate. This is a movie that will creep under your skin and stay there as a reminder of how love, death and redemption affects us all in such a variety of ways.

I remember before watching that movie, me telling my sister how Zac Efron was a better actor than Robert Pattinson simply because Zac Efron did an amazing role in Charlie St.Cloud and he's matured from his Disney days and it was clear. And that Robert Pattinson just played a vampire in Twilight and it wasn't much of an emotional show. Boy, did I put my foot in my mouth. I was so wrong.

There is a scene where she calls her older brother, Tyler, played by Robert Pattinson (their relationship was very touching), in tears because her ""friends"" have chopped off half her hair. In a later scene, she's in class with the best haircut they could manage to give her, though she's looking a little bit nerdy. The teacher says, ""Caroline... hello?"" I think to myself... what the heck? Caroline was looking down at her notebook, writing. The fact that this happened AFTER her fellow students battered her really disturbed me. I really think the teacher is part of the problem. Earlier in the movie she had been talking to Tyler about how she ""spaces out"" sometimes. Well, everybody daydreams sometimes. It's normal. Especially when you're bored in some lousy teacher's class! But this lady has her feeling something's wrong with her. It may even have prompted the other students to act as they did. Caroline came across to me as wise and mature for an 11-year-old and could grow up to become a productive member of society... if only she's treated well.I'm glad I didn't read any reviews ahead of time, as the ending was a complete surprise.

Girl finds out what all the wrong reasons were and dumps young man.  Girl realizes sometimes people do the right thing for the wrong reasons.  We've seen it before.Robert Pattinson plays Tyler Hawkins, the middle child of divorced parents.  Older brother is a suicide, neglected baby sister is artistically talented and bullied by mean girls in her private school.  Dad is a filthy rich lawyer who cares about his career more than his family.  Tyler is turned off by most everything in his life, and doesn't seem to be doing much of anything; he audits college courses instead of studying for credit and has no regular job.  The one person he seems to really care about, besides his lady friend, is his little sister, towards whom he is tender, caring and protective, the way their father should be and isn't.I found the climactic scene in the movie to be almost insultingly exploitative and having almost nothing to do with the overall plot; the hero could just as well have stepped unthinkingly in front of a speeding bus.  There are some creditable performances in the film, notably Pierce Brosnan as Tyler's lawyer dad, Lena Olin as his mother, and Ruby Jerins as his little sister.  But the film belongs to Robert Pattinson, who is in almost every scene and demonstrates once and for all that he is way more than just a pretty face.

I'm not a twilight fan, so I actually came into this partway negative simply because of the actor.But I was wrong.  Don't judge a book, or a movie evidently, by the cover.I didn't know this movie was leading up to any type of climatic ending, and so I simply enjoyed it.  Each scene added something, there were none that, as with most movies, you think should've ended up on the editing room floor so to speak.  There was no wasted motion, no extraneous storytelling.  It moved, flowed, and each scene led well to the next.The characters are well thought out, and, surprisingly to me, well acted.  You got not only a feel for them, but actually FELT for them.  A sense of compassion that movies have a difficult time dredging up out of the viewers.When the ""big scene"" at the end revealed itself with such simple measures, my jaw hit the floor.

1309146,AO80ZID761BZH,B002ZG98RS,Joseph_,"[12, 14]","""Remember Me"", when you glance at the DVD cover, says three things. One, you see Edward's- I mean, Robert Pattinson's- face, and you immediately assume this movie is pinpointed towards him breaking out of his vampire mold. Second, the title makes it obvious that someone dies, which  is just no fun. And third, it's a love story, and while that genre is perfectly fine, it gets old.But after I decided to humor my family and watch it, I was surprised by how much I ended up liking it.The plot-line is simple: two grown-up teenagers with broken families are trying to find their way through life, and after some unlikely events bring them together, they end up finding what they least expected: a love story. I think this movie would have been the forgettable film it looks like had it not been for a few things. Firstly, the acting. Robert Pattinson, painfully infamous for his Twilight role, really shows he's not that kind of actor at all: he's the type who can go from a million-dollar series to a much smaller movie, and do really well. His acting was believable and true, and that's why I liked his character to much, even related to him.The second was the other colorful cast members: everyone put in their heart to the movie, and you can truly tell they enjoyed working on it. The plot-line is pretty dark, and would have been too heavy had it not been for the comedic presence of Tate Ellington as the amusing prick of a friend who's got a good heart after all. Emilie de Ravin was beautiful and pulled her part as a struggling daughter who lost her mother very well. I thought Pierce Brosnan stood out too as the father whose kids think he doesn't care about them, when in reality he deeply loves all of them.The dialog was clever and fast, amusing at some points, touching at others. The plot moved along fast enough to keep us always interested, and it really almost forced us to care about the characters. New York was shot beautifully, and even the grittiest parts looked truly New York-ish.And, finally, the ending. Like many other people who've seen this movie, they knew beforehand what fate was held for Tyler in the end, but it was very sad nonetheless, and though it wasn't sad enough to cry, it was certainly heart-wrenching. Believable, and an interesting twist, you truly know his last moments are in his father's office, whether you've read the summary beforehand or not. I believe it certainly touched many people who lost loved ones on 9/11, and this movie may bring up terrible memories, though it honors them in the believability that Tyler's story was just one that was tied into the thousands in the nightmare of September 2001.A small, touching movie, ""Remember Me"" was far better than I expected, and worth a watch, even a buy if you'd like. I look forward to future Rob Pattinson movies now, and I believe our Edward had proved himself a truly noteworthy actor in his first big role since the Twilight phenomenon.

To somewhat describe his character: Tyler is from a rich family, tragedy hit his family unexpectedly , and he does whatever he can to keep his younger sister happy; even when he Himself is not happy. Tyler is not what you would consider a all-around sad person, but there are times where he is miserable and frustrated with those around him because to him, nothing is really that important. Tyler eventually gets involved with a girl Ally , and as a result, Remember Me has some memorable ups but also some heartbreaking downs then, the ending is so surprising that I had to rewind my dvd player to re play what had just happened.All that Said, Remember Me is one of those overlooked/underrated movies that is very addictive, thought provoking, moving, and most importantly, good to watch. I originally dismissed this movie because of the Twilight-hype with Robert Pattinson. But Robert really DOES has some Great acting abilities. As the front cover of the dvd case says : ""Robert pattinson gives a raw and gut-wrenching performance."" I agree with this statement 110%.

It addresses only the plot and the ending.The plot, if one can refer to the film as having a plot (perhaps it would be more to the point to refer to it as 'the point' of the film) was a statement on grief, life, forgiveness, love, revenge, and a multitude of other everyday experiences and emotions. As such, the movie had an unlimited number of paths to explore and many possible endings which could have better served the film.While the movie kinda dragged through some of these circumstantial emotions and provided the cast with a lines to read and recite; the 'point' of the film was relegated to being nil and pointless because of the blantant exploitation the ending ending.Having the ending tied unexpectedly to the circumstances of 0911, while not necessarily what I would term 'a slap in the face', as one reviewer described it, it was a jolt that was inconsistent with the rest of the film and it was a blatant attempt to use the sensationalizing of this a very real national tragedy in a film not otherwise related to the catastrophic loss this country collectively, and so many of its citizens individually, experienced - and as such was in extremely poor taste, not to mention trivializing any previous point the viewer may have been garnering from the story itself.For me personally the ending tacked tackily on the rest of the marginal film made this film one of my all-time least-liked films and I can not in good faith recommend it to anyone as a movie worth watching.",1,Not recommended....,1278028800,"07 2, 2010",2010,1573,"['am', 'not', 'tween', 'comment', 'nothing', 'do', 'Pattinson', 'other', 'cast', 'member', 'only', 'plot', 'ending.The', 'plot', 'one', 'can', 'refer', 'film', 'having', 'plot', 'perhaps', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'point', 'refer', 'point', 'film', 'was', 'statement', 'grief', 'life', 'forgiveness', 'love', 'revenge', 'multitude', 'other', 'everyday', 'experiences', 'emotions', 'such', 'movie', 'had', 'unlimited', 'number', 'paths', 'explore', 'many', 'possible', 'endings', 'could', 'have', 'better', 'served', 'film.While', 'movie', 'kinda', 'dragged', 'circumstantial', 'emotions', 'provided', 'cast', 'lines', 'read', 'recite', ""'point"", 'film', 'was', 'relegated', 'being', 'nil', 'pointless', 'blantant', 'exploitation', 'ending', 'ending.Having', 'ending', 'tied', 'unexpectedly', 'circumstances', '0911', 'not', 'necessarily', 'what', 'would', 'term', 'slap', 'face', 'one', 'reviewer', 'described', 'was', 'jolt', 'was', 'inconsistent', 'rest', 'film', 'was', 'blatant', 'attempt', 'use', 'sensationalizing', 'very', 'real', 'national', 'tragedy', 'film', 'not', 'otherwise', 'related', 'catastrophic', 'loss', 'country', 'collectively', 'so', 'many', 'citizens', 'individually', 'experienced', 'such', 'was', 'extremely', 'poor', 'taste', 'not', 'mention', 'trivializing', 'previous', 'point', 'viewer', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'garnering', 'story', 'itself.For', 'personally', 'ending', 'tacked', 'tackily', 'rest', 'marginal', 'film', 'made', 'film', 'one', 'all-time', 'least-liked', 'films', 'can', 'not', 'good', 'faith', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A

Tyler (Robert Pattinson) is the moody slacker son of a corporate fat cat (Pierce Brosnan) and Ally (Emilie de Raven) is the spunky daughter of a cop (Chris Cooper).  Tyler dates Ally on a dare but finds they have a real connection and their mutual trust begins to heal past losses.The first half of this romantic drama is about the two young lovers getting to know each other.  They're both grumpy and sarcastic and their conversations are made up mostly of monosyllabic grunts and mumbles  accompanied by much slouching and shoulder-shrugging. These scenes move a bit slowly, but in the second half, we see a much wider range of emotions and Cooper and Brosnan bring maturity and outstanding, nuanced performances.  Pattinson is surprisingly good, in spite of his trademark unkempt appearance.  Brosnan has outgrown his dashing leading-man days and graduated to wonderful, serious character actor status.  Cooper gives a poignant performance and almost steals the movie.The much talked-about ending seemed too manipulative to me.

1309161,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B002ZG98RS,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[9, 10]","I was not inclined to check out ""Remember Me"" because it stars Robert Pattison.  In the ""Twilight"" universe I belong to neither Team Edward nor Team Jacob, being more of a Team Bella kind of guy (or maybe Team Alice), so his presence was insufficient to get me interested.  But the movie also has Emilie de Ravin, who I remember as being young and pregnant on ""Roswell"" before she played young and pregnant on ""Lost,"" which restored some equilibrium.  But then I noticed that the movie had an A- rating on Redbox, which is one of the few A grades I have seen, so I decided to rent it, knowing nothing else about the movie.  It turns out that Pattison's Tyler Hawkins and de Ravin's Ally Craig, are both scarred by devastating deaths in their lives and in the great tradition of such movies, they find each other, and despite coming from totally different worlds and a deep dark secret that could threaten everything, it looks like things might possibly have a chance of actually working out between them as they heal each other.As far as both leads go I can say this is the best work I have seen either of them turn in.  For the first time I got a sense of Pattison as playing an interesting character who is neither Hogwart's golden boy nor the paragon of undead virtue, and the actor gets bonus points for being an executive producer on this film, which underscores his level of commitment to this product.  But as much as I liked his performance I thought de Ravine was better.  Certainly her's is the more grounded and realistic character, and she avoids a lot of the stereotypical problems of the female character in this type of romance.  Then there is Ruby Jerins as Tyler's kid sister Caroline.  I have watched Jerins in ""Nurse Jackie,"" where I am pretty sure I have never seen her character, a child worried about way too much to far too great a degree, crack a smile.  So it was nice seeing her be more like a real kid, although Caroline has her own problems.  In many ways, the most touching relationship in the film is between Caroline and Tyler, while the most troubled is between Tyler and their father, Charles (Pierce Brosnan), who is apparently as rich as he is distant from his children.  Ally has issues with her father (Chris Coooper), a New York City cop, who actually gets to meet Tyler before she does, and therein lies another crucial element in the tale.  As you might guess with Brosnan and Cooper as the fathers, the supporting cast of this 2010 film is a major strength.  The international flavor of the cast continues with Lena Olin as Tyler's mom, and then we throw into the mix Martha Plimpton as Ally's mother and Kate Burton as Brosnan's assistant.  Finally, director Allen Coulter, whose name you might recognize more from his directing television series on HBO than as the director of ""Hollywoodland,"" brings an elegant artistic touch to this film.The problematic element of this movie for the critics (versus the reviewers) is the ending, which, I have to admit, I did not see coming, because I did not pick up on the significance of the opening shot or work out the dates to realize this is not a film set in our present.  For that matter, I did not try to decode the meaning of the film's title.  That being said, I think there are three factors supporting the conclusion.  The first is that the ending is well set up as a surprise.  Marcelo Zarvos's score creates a strong sense of unease that something not too good is going to happen, and those of you adept at ""reading"" a film will pick up on what is going to be the source of that badness, only that is not how it plays out.  I am not sure if the credit belongs to the screenplay or the director, but it plays out well.  The second would be how the more you think about the movie the more you can see how the actions of the characters ended up switching the positions of two of them, and you all know how I love irony the master trope of the universe.  The final and least important one is that screenwriter Will Fetters literally began with the ending and then decided to tell a story that reached that particular point.  There is no way of knowing that when you just see the film, and I did not find out about it until afterwards, but it is important to appreciate that the ending is integral to the story and not one of those endings that Hollywood producers like to slap on a film.",5,"""Remember Me"" is a surprisingly good film on so many levels",1278460800,"07 7, 2010",2010,4378,"['was', 'not', 'inclined', 'check', 'out', 'Remember', 'Me', 'Robert', 'Pattison', 'Twilight', 'universe', 'belong', 'Team', 'Edward', 'Team', 'Jacob', 'being', 'more', 'Team', 'Bella', 'kind', 'guy', 'maybe', 'Team', 'Alice', 'presence', 'was', 'insufficient', 'get', 'interested', 'movie', 'also', 'Emilie', 'de', 'Ravin', 'who', 'remember', 'being', 'young', 'pregnant', 'Roswell', 'played', 'young', 'pregnant', 'Lost', 'restored', 'equilibrium', 'then', 'noticed', 'movie', 'had', 'A-', 'rating', 'Redbox', 'one', 'few', 'A', 'grades', 'have', 'seen', 'decided', 'rent', 'knowing', 'nothing', 'else', 'movie', 'out', 'Pattison', 'Tyler', 'Hawkins', 'de', 'Ravin', 'Ally', 'Craig', 'are', 'scarred', 'devastating', 'deaths', 'lives', 'great', 'tradition', 'such', 'movies', 'find', 'other', 'coming', 'totally', 'different', 'worlds', 'deep', 'dark', 'secret', 'could', 'threaten', 'everything', 'things', 'might', 'possibly', 'have', 'chance', 'actually', 'working', 'out', 'heal', 'other.As', 'far', 'go', 'can', 'say', 'best', 'work', 'have', 'seen', 'turn', 'first', 'time', 'got', 'sense', 'Pattison', 'playing', 'interesting', 'character', 'who', 'Hogwart', 'golden', 'boy', 'paragon', 'undead', 'virtue', 'actor', 'bonus', 'points', 'being', 'executive', 'producer', 'film', 'level', 'commitment', 'product', 'as', 'much', 'liked', 'performance', 'thought', 'de', 'Ravine', 'was', 'better', 'Certainly', 'more', 'grounded', 'realistic', 'character', 'lot', 'stereotypical', 'problems', 'female', 'character', 'type', 'romance', 'Then', 'Ruby', 'Jerins', 'Tyler', 'kid', 'sister', 'Caroline', 'have', 'watched', 'Jerins', 'Nurse', 'Jackie', 'where', 'am', 'pretty', 'sure', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'character', 'child', 'worried', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'far', 'too', 'great', 'degree', 'crack', 'smile', 'was', 'nice', 'seeing', 'be', 'more', 'real', 'kid', 'Caroline', 'own', 'problems', 'many', 'ways', 'most', 'touching', 'relationship', 'film', 'Caroline', 'Tyler', 'most', 'troubled', 'Tyler', 'father', 'Charles', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'who', 'apparently', 'as', 'rich', 'distant', 'children', 'Ally', 'issues', 'father', 'Chris', 'Coooper', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'cop', 'who', 'actually', 'meet', 'Tyler', 'therein', 'crucial', 'element', 'tale', 'might', 'guess', 'Brosnan', 'Cooper', 'fathers', 'supporting', 'cast', '2010', 'film', 'major', 'strength', 'international', 'flavor', 'cast', 'Lena', 'Olin', 'Tyler', 'mom', 'then', 'throw', 'mix', 'Martha', 'Plimpton', 'Ally', 'mother', 'Kate', 'Burton', 'Brosnan', 'assistant', 'Finally', 'director', 'Allen', 'Coulter', 'name', 'might', 'recognize', 'more', 'directing', 'television', 'series', 'HBO', 'director', 'Hollywoodland', 'elegant', 'artistic', 'touch', 'film.The', 'problematic', 'element', 'movie', 'critics', 'reviewers', 'ending', 'have', 'admit', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'coming', 'did', 'not', 'pick', 'up', 'significance', 'opening', 'shot', 'work', 'out', 'dates', 'realize', 'not', 'film', 'set', 'present', 'matter', 'did', 'not', 'try', 'decode', 'meaning', 'film', 'title', 'being', 'said', 'think', 'are', 'three', 'factors', 'supporting', 'conclusion', 'first', 'ending', 'well', 'set', 'up', 'surprise', 'Marcelo', 'Zarvos', 'score', 'strong', 'sense', 'unease', 'something', 'not', 'too', 'good', 'going', 'happen', 'adept', 'reading', 'film', 'will', 'pick', 'up', 'what', 'going', 'be', 'source', 'badness', 'only', 'not', 'how', 'out', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'credit', 'belongs', 'screenplay', 'director', 'out', 'well', 'second', 'would', 'be', 'how', 'more', 'think', 'movie', 'more', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'actions', 'characters', 'ended', 'up', 'switching', 'positions', 'two', 'know', 'how', 'love', 'master', 'trope', 'universe', 'final', 'least', 'important', 'one', 'screenwriter', 'Will', 'Fetters', 'literally', 'began', 'ending', 'then', 'decided', 'tell', 'story', 'reached', 'particular', 'point', 'way', 'knowing', 'when', 'just', 'see', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'out', 'afterwards', 'important', 'appreciate', 'ending', 'integral', 'story', 'not', 'one', 'endings', 'Hollywood', 'producers', 'slap', 'film']",N/A

I was pleasantly surprised with the father character played by Pierce Brosnan (on the surface, despicable, but later on reveals a depth of emotion) as well as young actress Ruby Jarins (of Nurse Jackie fame). The movie overall is touching and a bit sad. I really enjoyed it. It had just enough humor as well as drama to keep it moving. The end should be a surprise, unless you've read too many reviews; in my opinion, this shouldn't matter as it is a fine film regardless. I watch movies to immerse myself into the story and forget about life's little problems. This film makes you realize that there are: 1) no places that you are truly safe in, and 2) your problems are likely insignificant compared to others'. I am completely impressed with the story, acting, production, etc. and I watch A LOT of movies. This one is unique, like Memento was in its own way.

De Taeye,"[4, 5]","After having watched this movie the first time (I always watch a movie twice unless I deem it really bad or stupid), I had mixed emotions about it. I could tell I liked it but some things bugged me too. I went to check the top critics' reviews on rotten tomatoes to see what the general opinion was. It fared really poorly and some reviews delivered easy, mean punches aimed at Pattinson, in particular. I am not a fan of the guy but he doesn't bother me either, and I get reallly irritated when it seems that he is being blamed for cheesy melos in which he has played, a.k.a. the twilight saga, and also when journalists get sarcastic about the fandom that he seems to generate. Get over it people: Pattinson is a fine young man, maybe not the greatest actor but maybe it's just because he hasn't come across great material.Anyway, I thought the negative reviews were unfair and easy but, what the heck, if viewers enjoy and are moved by a movie, it's really what matters most.I definitely would praise the movie for its raw and true performances, in spite of the fact that I thought the dialogues were often either overdone or underdone, as may happen sometimes in indie cinema with a focus on character. However, everybody pulled it off nicely. The plot has a major, obvious flaw being that it brings on a tragedy at the very end of the story and therefore minimizes other human dramas already at play: the loss of a parent in brutal circumstances, the suicide of a sibling, divorce and the absence of a parent... In these aspects alone, the movie had enough substance and emotions that it didn't need to bring on a major heartbreaking event to top it off. I know what the screenwriter was trying to convey - I watched the bonus feature - but I still think he missed his point. Some critics were not nice about it either.

This is a guy who wrecks or sullies everything he touches. But it's all done by divine right. Yes, this is a guy with many talents, and he uses them all to create his own cult of personality.

He doesn't see them ever catching up to the likes of him. Imagine his surprise when a lie destroys the love of his life, the one girl we're asked to believe he ""really"" cares for. As she stands there, stunned by what he has done to her, he is too arrogant to say the words that could salvage the situation. And does he apologize afterward? Why should he when he has a best friend who is willing to do it for him? And of course she comes back. He is just too cool for her not to. Really? Are we supposed to accept this as credible drama?But hold on, it gets worse. We're supposed to be tricked by the filmmakers into thinking well of our hero because he loves his little sister. Hell, he even goes on a rage and gets arrested for her. But it's not nearly enough to compensate for the wreckage he otherwise strews.

I have seen enough of him to know that he is capable of far more than the critics realize.  However, most movie making today is a vast wasteland and most movies, even the critically acclaimed ones, are drek.The subject matter appeared to be trite and so I avoided the movie until just this moment.  December 31, 2010.  I decided to give it a try, knowing that the movie would most likely be fair to middling.As has been said over and over here..  I was so wrong.  The movie is a simple yet profound story, beautifully directed and exquisitely acted by the entire company, Robert Pattinson delivers a performance that should have been NOTED.  His growth as an actor is evident.  Add to this the touching portrayal of Ally by Emilie Ravin, the wondrous performance by Roby Jerins as Caroline, and the stalwart performances by Chris Cooper and Pierce Brosnan who round out the cast.The devil is in the details, and every facet of this productions was gorgeous.  Allen Coulter crafted a beautiful film here.  The music, by Marcelo Zarvos was sparkling and powerful.  The cinemtagraphy, by Jonathan Freeman was delicious.  I particuarly loved the way he framed the scenes though windows or from hallways, giving the viewer the very strong feeling of actually witnessing a real life drama.  The effect was deepened by the powerful, realistic portrayals of the two leads, Pattinson and de Ravin, as their lives collided.  Set decoration by Diana Lederman was miraculous.All of these things melded into a strong movie with a strong message.  Live now because life is precious and fragile.  Tyler Hawkins and Ally Craig both knew this from hard experience.  They had both lost someone immensely important in their lives,  with no warning, and so had just about every one else in this movie.And in the end, Tyler's life and his message impacted the lives of those he loved.  I had no idea what was coming, and so when I saw the date on the blackboard, ""Oh god, no"" escaped my lips.  Horror filled me because I had come to care deeply for Tyler and his love, Emilie and their families.  I wondered how I had missed it.  And I immediately watched the movie again.  Not one second of film is wasted.  Every moment is exposition, in some form or other.  This movie is one of the most hauntingly beautiful movies I have ever seen.  Powerful, human, and profoundly moving.

I watched him in Twilight and thought that he was terrible, but he is very good here.  I won't say anything to give the ending away, but there is a twist that will blow your mind if you don't already know what's coming.  I highly suggest that everyone see this at least once.",4,Surprised At How Much I Liked It,1320710400,"11 8, 2011",2011,416,"['am', 'not', 'big', 'romance', 'fan', 'really', 'movie', 'was', 'shocked', 'find', 'out', 'Robert', 'Pattinson', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'actor', 'watched', 'Twilight', 'thought', 'was', 'terrible', 'very', 'good', 'here', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'anything', 'give', 'ending', 'away', 'twist', 'will', 'blow', 'mind', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'know', 'what', 'coming', 'highly', 'suggest', 'everyone', 'see', 'least', 'once']",N/A

Yes I am a Pattinson fan, but I am also a stickler for a good, morose drama. Well I must say that this film provides a bit of both. Handsome and brooding, Pattinson honestly does a great job as a young man with a sort of screwed up life. I truly don't wish to give anything away but I urge people to just see it for themselves. The romance is believable and never over the top and while the pace isn't quick, it never drags. For me, the ending came out of nowhere and as soon as I saw it coming, I think I may have even gasped. Some people may find it random or contrived, but if you really think about it, it doesn't even matter. What happened, happened. I'll leave it at that.",4,Surprisingly good,1276128000,"06 10, 2010",2010,748,"['reading', 'so', 'many', 'critical', 'reviews', 'was', 'prepared', 'worst', 'Yes', 'am', 'Pattinson', 'fan', 'am', 'also', 'stickler', 'good', 'morose', 'drama', 'Well', 'must', 'say', 'film', 'bit', 'Handsome', 'brooding', 'Pattinson', 'honestly', 'great', 'job', 'young', 'man', 'sort', 'screwed', 'up', 'life', 'truly', 'do', ""n't"", 'wish', 'give', 'anything', 'away', 'urge', 'people', 'just', 'see', 'romance', 'believable', 'never', 'top', 'pace', ""n't"", 'quick', 'never', 'ending', 'came', 'nowhere', 'as', 'soon', 'saw', 'coming', 'think', 'may', 'have', 'even', 'gasped', 'people', 'may', 'find', 'random', 'contrived', 'really', 'think', ""n't"", 'even', 'matter', 'What', 'happened', 'happened', ""'ll"", 'leave']",N/A
