(1) Abandoned teen boy tries to survive without a mother, (2) but he also spends considerable screen-time in teen-related scenes with a girl, and, oh, yes, there is (3) the art forgery angle that could have made this a great movie but was treated only as perhaps a third subplot. Agonizingly slow story goes in all direction and goes nowhere. The lead character, Josh, has a habit of breaking into houses and getting into fights---overall an obnoxious and irritating lead character with no clear positive values. Yet the writers of this mess want us to believe that he is redeemable because he has an art talent. Even that angle is not developed sufficiently. Lauren Bacall and Alfred Molina do a great acting job in the limited length of time they spend on the screen---two great talents essentially wasted in this sorry mess that was probably a TV-movie. Even in that genre it should have been canned.

He ends up entering-but-not-breaking into the home of an artist who eventually becomes his temporary guardian and who commissions a forged painting from him.Basically, Everly (the artist/art dealer) takes advantage of Joshua's talent and the fact that he is a kid with no place left to go. In steps Anne Marie, who DOES in fact give a care about him. Turns out that Anne Marie and Everly have a little something in common.Then there's Amber, who Joshua decides right away he has a thing for. He befriends her and her older brother and becomes a bit possessive of her. Amber (Hayden Panieterre) doesn't have a crucial role in this film. I think they just threw her in for a romantic element.Still confused about the little Irish guy. I'm not sure if he's supposed to be Everly's partner or his partner, partner if you catch my drift. Either way, he's a bit annoying.Storyline was interesting enough, though I found that the movie is not nearly as dark as it is depicted in the trailer, which shows guns and plays some very dramatic music. No, it doesn't end up in a shoot-out or anything.Anyway, this film is pretty predictable and very hurt-comforty. (JHutch cries like a champ. Prepare to have those heartstrings pulled). The acting is good, but the actual story is so-so. It was entertaining, and appropriate for younger ages (Hardly any profanity, no sex, but a bit of punching).

1531463,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B007IU8YY4,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[2, 3]","THE FORGER (a/k/a CARMEL-BY-THE-SEA, Prod. Josh Hutcherson/Carlos De Los Rios, Writ. Carlos De Los Rios/Lawrence Roeck, Dir. Lawrence Roeck, 2012, 110 minutes) was sort of fun, humorous 'after-school-special' type drama that kept me watching.Josh Hutcherson plays Joshua Mason, a Carmel, California kid of immense misfortune. His horrifying monster of a mother, drug addict and child abuser, abandons him in a motel room where he is later found. Though he is supposed to be 15, Joshua somehow eludes school and even foster care. He is taken under the wing of a suave art forger (Alfred Molina) who needs Joshua's immense artistic talents.One thing simultaneously refreshing and frightening is the art forgery lesson this film teaches. Never have I seen a film specifically oriented this way, but it felt quite real to me. More real than the drama it enfolded.Along the way he meets the wonderful, immortal Lauren Bacall as Anne-Marie, the local eccentric millionairess. There is a scene when the two hug, Lauren and Josh, and I wondered: Does that boy know he is hugging HOLLYWOOD?! Did he have any idea of the person with whom he was sharing a scene? Not only do I maintain my crush on the beautiful but eternally wooden Hutcherson, now I actually sort of hate him for being a big-time producer AND hugging Lauren Bacall!!What next, he gets to play Peter O'Toole's great-grandson with Colin Firth as his father??This is a gently funny and gently moral tale; its PG-13 rating is well-deserved, and I see a greater future for Hutcherson as producer than as an actor - though he can keep doing acting as long as one day he plays that dream gay role I fully expect of him. Meanwhile, don't miss this colorful, meaningful film that somehow seems to float aimlessly in spite of all the drama.I'm not too sure the director knew what he was trying to say here: it is his first picture. But they all did a hell of a job trying. As for Lauren Bacall, I imagine this was like a mini-vacation for the likes of her! Is there anyone left alive today who is her equal?!With the additional talents of Billy Boyd, Adam Godley, an incredibly gorgeous Scott Eastwood (yes, Clint's son whose real name is Scott Reeves), and Dakota-Fanning-lookalike Hayden Panetierre as Joshua's love interest. Filmed on location in Carmel, California.HUTCHERSON, INC.:There's a passing of the torch evident here for Kentucky-born Hutcherson, who additionally has had to suffer rumors about his gay self. Here he is, in a film he produced, costarring with Lauren Bacall and Alfred Molina. Note, the only thing of interest he's done since this film is The Hunger Games, with whatever number of sequels to follow. Hutcherson started out as a mere boy doing TV until he landed the part of ""the hero boy"" inPolar Express. He then popped up conspicuously in Robin Williams' lame comeback comedyRV, playing Williams' son. He then starred inBridge To Terabithiawhich annoyed a lot of people for some reason.Hutcherson was sort of reborn as a sex symbol inJourney to the Center of Earth, by which time it was clear somebody was seeing to this boy's meteoric rise to stardom. After sufferingThe Kids Are All Right, Hutcherson showed his sweet self in the sequel to JOURNEY,Journey 2: The Mysterious Island (+ UltraViolet Digital Copy).After he finally 'hit it big' in the overblown HUNGER GAMES he's gone on to star in a very busy 2013 schedule: the sequel THE HUNGER GAMES: CATCHING FIRE (see him for now inChase the Stars: The Cast of the Hunger Games), the remake RED DAWN, PARADISE LOST (based on the true story of the West Memphis Three) and he will of course be doing a second sequel to JOURNEY: JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH 3.If he's not careful, he'll be the next Mel Gibson (in the best sense of the description).",4,"Stellar cast, gentle film, I wanted and expected more",1362182400,"03 2, 2013",2013,3783,"['FORGER', 'a/k/a', 'CARMEL-BY-THE-SEA', 'Prod', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson/Carlos', 'De', 'Los', 'Rios', 'Writ', 'Carlos', 'De', 'Los', 'Rios/Lawrence', 'Roeck', 'Dir', 'Lawrence', 'Roeck', '2012', '110', 'minutes', 'was', 'sort', 'fun', 'humorous', ""'after-school-special"", 'type', 'drama', 'kept', 'watching.Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'Joshua', 'Mason', 'Carmel', 'California', 'kid', 'immense', 'misfortune', 'horrifying', 'monster', 'mother', 'drug', 'addict', 'child', 'abuser', 'abandons', 'motel', 'room', 'where', 'later', 'found', 'supposed', 'be', '15', 'Joshua', 'somehow', 'school', 'even', 'foster', 'care', 'taken', 'wing', 'suave', 'art', 'forger', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'who', 'Joshua', 'immense', 'artistic', 'talents.One', 'thing', 'simultaneously', 'refreshing', 'frightening', 'art', 'forgery', 'lesson', 'film', 'teaches', 'Never', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'specifically', 'oriented', 'way', 'felt', 'quite', 'real', 'More', 'real', 'drama', 'enfolded.Along', 'way', 'wonderful', 'immortal', 'Lauren', 'Bacall', 'Anne-Marie', 'local', 'eccentric', 'millionairess', 'scene', 'when', 'two', 'hug', 'Lauren', 'Josh', 'wondered', 'Does', 'boy', 'know', 'hugging', 'HOLLYWOOD', 'Did', 'have', 'idea', 'person', 'whom', 'was', 'sharing', 'scene', 'Not', 'only', 'do', 'maintain', 'crush', 'beautiful', 'eternally', 'wooden', 'Hutcherson', 'now', 'actually', 'sort', 'hate', 'being', 'big-time', 'producer', 'AND', 'hugging', 'Lauren', 'Bacall', 'What', 'next', 'play', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'great-grandson', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'father', 'gently', 'funny', 'gently', 'moral', 'tale', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'well-deserved', 'see', 'greater', 'future', 'Hutcherson', 'producer', 'actor', 'can', 'keep', 'doing', 'acting', 'as', 'long', 'one', 'day', 'dream', 'gay', 'role', 'fully', 'expect', 'Meanwhile', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'colorful', 'meaningful', 'film', 'somehow', 'float', 'aimlessly', 'spite', 'drama.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'too', 'sure', 'director', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'trying', 'say', 'here', 'first', 'picture', 'did', 'hell', 'job', 'trying', 'Lauren', 'Bacall', 'imagine', 'was', 'mini-vacation', 'likes', 'there', 'anyone', 'left', 'alive', 'today', 'who', 'equal', 'additional', 'talents', 'Billy', 'Boyd', 'Adam', 'Godley', 'incredibly', 'gorgeous', 'Scott', 'Eastwood', 'yes', 'Clint', 'son', 'real', 'name', 'Scott', 'Reeves', 'Dakota-Fanning-lookalike', 'Hayden', 'Panetierre', 'Joshua', 'love', 'interest', 'Filmed', 'location', 'Carmel', 'California.HUTCHERSON', 'INC.', 'passing', 'torch', 'evident', 'here', 'Kentucky-born', 'Hutcherson', 'who', 'additionally', 'had', 'suffer', 'rumors', 'gay', 'self', 'Here', 'film', 'produced', 'costarring', 'Lauren', 'Bacall', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'Note', 'only', 'thing', 'interest', 'done', 'film', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'whatever', 'number', 'sequels', 'follow', 'Hutcherson', 'started', 'out', 'mere', 'boy', 'doing', 'TV', 'landed', 'part', 'hero', 'boy', 'inPolar', 'Express', 'then', 'popped', 'up', 'conspicuously', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'lame', 'comeback', 'comedyRV', 'playing', 'Williams', 'son', 'then', 'starred', 'inBridge', 'Terabithiawhich', 'lot', 'people', 'reason.Hutcherson', 'was', 'sort', 'reborn', 'sex', 'symbol', 'inJourney', 'Center', 'Earth', 'time', 'was', 'clear', 'somebody', 'was', 'seeing', 'boy', 'meteoric', 'rise', 'stardom', 'sufferingThe', 'Kids', 'Are', 'Right', 'Hutcherson', 'showed', 'sweet', 'self', 'sequel', 'JOURNEY', 'Journey', '2', 'Mysterious', 'Island', '+', 'UltraViolet', 'Digital', 'Copy', '.After', 'finally', ""'hit"", 'big', 'overblown', 'HUNGER', 'GAMES', 'gone', 'star', 'very', 'busy', '2013', 'schedule', 'sequel', 'THE', 'HUNGER', 'GAMES', 'CATCHING', 'FIRE', 'see', 'now', 'Stars', 'Cast', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'remake', 'RED', 'DAWN', 'PARADISE', 'LOST', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'West', 'Memphis', 'Three', 'will', 'course', 'be', 'doing', 'second', 'sequel', 'JOURNEY', 'JOURNEY', 'THE', 'CENTER', 'THE', 'EARTH', '3.If', 'not', 'careful', ""'ll"", 'be', 'next', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'best', 'sense', 'description']",The Forger

And how it's about art and the positive impact the arts can have on people, as well as the possible dark side.However, there a number of problems (I'll try to avoid too many spoilers):- What crazy person decided to market this as a thriller?  This is definitely NOT a thriller by a long shot.  More of a coming-of-age drama about a troubled teenager.  I honestly wondered what movie I was watching at first.  Because it did not fit the description on the box at all.- The way the other characters respond to the protagonist is too unbelievable.  Seriously, more of them should be creeped out or concerned about his anti-social behavior.  Or at least be more cautious around him.  Or fed up.  Or something.- God.  The teen romance.  No.  Please no.  This has to be my least favorite aspect of the film.  It feels so forced and trite and stupid and unrealistic and makes me gag.  Hayden Panettiere's obnoxious, perky wholesomeness doesn't help much to boot.- This almost feels like two storylines smashed together.  One is about art forgery.  The other is the main character's life.  I really think the screenwriter/director should have either picked one or the other.  Because they don't seem to mesh well to me.  There are too many ideas and such floating around for the running time.  We never get to explore any of them fully.- There are a few too many loose ends that never add up.  Also, some things should have been clarified better.  When my dad saw this there was one point in particular he didn't get because of the way a scene was edited.  I had to explain it to him.- Does not hold up well under multiple viewings.  You become more and more aware of the flaws and plot holes.So yeah.  To be fair there are good points, too.

1531469,A2A1HXFSAPA9A5,B007IU8YY4,S. Der,"[0, 0]","Contained some spoilers-----------------------This movie could had easily been a 5 star movie, but it failed to do so many things. At times this movie felt like an A-movie, but at other times it felt like a B-movie. The acting, story line, and directing was really a mix of good and bad. Also, the music used was great, but it was sometimes too dramatic and messed up the movie.For the acting, it seemed like Hayden Panetiere and Josh Hutcherson were the best in the movie. The other actors had their moments, but in other scenes failed to make the movie more realistic. So, in some scenes I was believing what they were doing and in other scenes it all just seemed way too scripted.I find that the story was very bad at times, where it doesn't make any sense. But, the movie still goes forward even though it doesn't make sense. For example, when the case worker finds Josh's character's mother finally! She steps in and looks at the situation. The mother asks the case worker what she doing there but never answers her. The case worker saw that the mom is abusing a new small child. The case worker goes off and calls for the police. The mother is never heard from again because the case worker told Josh character she didn't find his mother. The way the story was build didn't make sense for him to care that his mom was still abusing kids. He doesn't care that he was abused, that another kid was too, or that his mom is a drug addict. He just wants to see his mom and the story doesn't let that happen. And so, the movie just moves on from that to the next so builded up scene, which was even worse than the last.The very worse scene was the climax of the movie. This is where the audience is waiting to see if the painting being shown is real or not. The super big showing that will save Everly (art dealer), career, fortune, and life basically. Then, all of a sudden Aunt Marie (kind old artist) comes out of no where and reveals that she was a art forger before and tells people there the painting is a forgery. Her acting was terrible when she slashed up the painting and her acting was even worse when she threaten Everly. Then, the story just allowed her to do whatever with her life after that. No one stopped her after words, no police for past crimes? No angry art buyers? Not even Everly? What kind of movie is this???Then, Josh Hutcherson character was there too and no one stopped him either or did anything bad happened to him afterwards. The very end of the movie doesn't make sense! Now Everly just lost everything!!!! He bascailly going to be living in the gutter for the rest of his life or be dead by the people that he borrowed money from, but he didn't do anything about it or was mad. He just disappeared after that. That's so crazy!!! You would think he would really want to get back at Josh character for spoling everything and basically killing him. But, no, nothing happens. Also, what happened to the $5K that he gave Josh at the end too? You don't think Everly going o want that back because he basically broke and $5 cut can still buy him some things to get out of the country, while he still can that is. So, the movie just allows Josh's character to keep the money? Man that's hard to believe.This movie is way to nice on everyone that is good and too unrealistic for the ones that are part. Even aunt Marie was let off too easy. This movie creates a ""force happy ending"", even though, there was no way of really having one. So, it doesn't make any sense based on the events leading towards the climax and after, but everyone likes a happy ending, right? Even if it doesn't make sense on how it got there. NOT!!!It's a so-so movie. Watch it at your own risk. But, you might find yourself thinking at the end of the movie, ""what kind of ending was that?????""",3,"A-movie, B-movie?

1531470,A1CLUR3JCYO0TQ,B007IU8YY4,stevie,"[0, 0]","So this is one of those movies that slips by the public. I guess they can't have every movie in theaters. Anyway, there is some recognizable names in this one. Alfred Molina, Hayden Panetierre, and Josh Hutcherson (coming off the successful Hunger Games) lead up the cast. Also, they have that one guy who was one of the hobbits in lord of the rings. And this is how his career has turned out??Ok, so Hutcherson is supposed to be 15 in the movie. He looks boyish enough to pull it off I guess. They are stretching it though. Panetierre is supposed to be around the same age although they hint at her being a couple years older than Hutcherson. Nevertheless, this is a pet peeve of mine. Why does Hollywood always hire actors in their 20s and 30s to be teenagers? In this case, we lucked out. Hutcherson is 19, but panetierre is 23 which is my age. In my opinion, teenage girls never looked like adults when I was in high school. Nevertheless, we continue.So Hutcherson is a homeless teen. The typical homeless teen scenario plays out. His mom ran away and he never knew his dad. He knows the social workers more than anyone else and he has no friends. But he can draw! A local artist discovers his abilities after Hutcherson breaks into his house to make a sandwich and take a shower. Hutcherson stumbles into the basement and completes a painting the artist was working on. Then, we learn that the artist is actually a forger who wants to use the kids abilities to make money. And this could have been a really great premise for a movie which is exactly why I wanted to see it. Also, panetiere is in it to remember?Well, hutcherson does not like that the artist is a forger. He is only slightly on board with the plan to do a couple more forgery jobs. He really just wants to skip town because I guess that is what all the homeless kids want. He carries that attitude through the whole movie and there is little redemption. A couple meaningless side stories transpire. The case worker tries to find his mom. Panetierre is sort of his friend. However, it is unclear why they would be close because he keeps hurting her every other scene. Well, she is in their to be a love interest. However, she does not have any real impact on the story. The movie is not really about art forgeries even though it is. Its about Hutcherson searching for some peace. There is no mystery or intrigue behind the forgeries. No high stakes scenes. No consequences until the end of the movie. Even then, we don't know what happens to the real forger, Molina. The movie just kind of ends and I was disappointed.",2,More of a drama than a thriller,1349568000,"10 7, 2012",2012,2588,"['So', 'one', 'movies', 'slips', 'public', 'guess', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'movie', 'theaters', 'Anyway', 'recognizable', 'names', 'one', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'Hayden', 'Panetierre', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'coming', 'off', 'successful', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'lead', 'up', 'cast', 'Also', 'have', 'one', 'guy', 'who', 'was', 'one', 'hobbits', 'lord', 'rings', 'how', 'career', 'turned', 'out', 'Ok', 'Hutcherson', 'supposed', 'be', '15', 'movie', 'boyish', 'enough', 'pull', 'off', 'guess', 'are', 'stretching', 'Panetierre', 'supposed', 'be', 'same', 'age', 'hint', 'being', 'couple', 'years', 'older', 'Hutcherson', 'Nevertheless', 'pet', 'peeve', 'mine', 'Why', 'Hollywood', 'always', 'hire', 'actors', '20s', '30s', 'be', 'teenagers', 'case', 'lucked', 'out', 'Hutcherson', '19', 'panetierre', '23', 'age', 'opinion', 'teenage', 'girls', 'never', 'looked', 'adults', 'when', 'was', 'high', 'school', 'Nevertheless', 'continue.So', 'Hutcherson', 'homeless', 'teen', 'typical', 'homeless', 'teen', 'scenario', 'out', 'mom', 'ran', 'away', 'never', 'knew', 'dad', 'social', 'workers', 'more', 'anyone', 'else', 'friends', 'can', 'draw', 'local', 'artist', 'discovers', 'abilities', 'Hutcherson', 'breaks', 'house', 'make', 'sandwich', 'take', 'shower', 'Hutcherson', 'basement', 'painting', 'artist', 'was', 'working', 'Then', 'learn', 'artist', 'actually', 'forger', 'who', 'use', 'kids', 'abilities', 'make', 'money', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'great', 'premise', 'movie', 'exactly', 'why', 'wanted', 'see', 'Also', 'remember', 'Well', 'hutcherson', 'not', 'artist', 'forger', 'only', 'slightly', 'board', 'plan', 'do', 'couple', 'more', 'forgery', 'jobs', 'really', 'just', 'skip', 'town', 'guess', 'what', 'homeless', 'kids', 'want', 'attitude', 'whole', 'movie', 'little', 'redemption', 'couple', 'meaningless', 'side', 'stories', 'transpire', 'case', 'worker', 'tries', 'find', 'mom', 'Panetierre', 'sort', 'friend', 'However', 'unclear', 'why', 'would', 'be', 'close', 'hurting', 'other', 'scene', 'Well', 'be', 'love', 'interest', 'However', 'not', 'have', 'real', 'impact', 'story', 'movie', 'not', 'really', 'art', 'forgeries', 'even', 'Hutcherson', 'searching', 'peace', 'mystery', 'intrigue', 'forgeries', 'high', 'stakes', 'scenes', 'consequences', 'end', 'movie', 'Even', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'real', 'forger', 'Molina', 'movie', 'just', 'kind', 'ends', 'was', 'disappointed']",The Forger
