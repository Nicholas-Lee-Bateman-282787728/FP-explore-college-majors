It didn't help that there was absolutely no attempt at suspense, just cheap kills.  As far as the story goes, the past and present are doled out in stages, like shuffling a deck of cards (and just about as interesting).  The characters aren't involving; most are archetypes, there to suit the purpose of a cloyingly slim premise: the hometown return of the only survivor (Angela Bettis as Joan Burrows) of a serial killer.  The minute she steps foot in the vicinity, the killings begin again, thus making her the ONLY suspect.  In this little town of nowhere, forensics is never applied, nor is a great deal of thought.  The movie simply stumbles to a clumsy ending/reveal that can be seen coming from miles away.The filmmakers' astounding reliance on standard horror gimmicks results in a complete lack of originality (however did they get funding for this dud?).  I'm sure it looked much worse on paper than as filmed.My reaction is less about the graphic nature of this film and more about the slipshod way it was made.

You tell me to keep on killing, and you get to keep on living""Thus is the basic premise of the torture porn flick, Scar 3-D. Survivor of a sadistic attack by a demented mortician, Joan Burrows (Angela Bettis - May), is returning home to visit her police officer brother Jeff (Christopher Titus - Titus), and niece Olympia (Kirby Bliss Blanton - Hannah Montana) for Olympia's high school graduation. Almost as soon as Joan is back, two of the graduating class disappears mysteriously. As the mutilated body of one appears, another student disappears. Much like when Joan was being held by Bishop (Ben Cotton - Slither). What follows is a series of found bodies and disappearing students. Among the new characters around town is the new mortuary director Melvin Gray (Bill Baksa - Tucker & Dale vs. Evil), Olympia's friend Paul (Devon Grave - Dexter), and Paul's father (James D. Hopkin - Fear Itself).Part of the film is told through flashbacks of Joan's capture with her friend Susie while partying in the cemetery, ensuing torture at the hand of Bishop, and her eventual escape and killing of her tormentor. The flashbacks are spaced nicely to coincide with events in the current storyline. But it's not enough to save this film from mediocrity. While the movie has good, disturbing scenes and story, it never lives up to its full potential.Special Features:Scar 3-D come in both a 2-D and 3-D version with two pairs of 3-D classesTheatrical Trailer16:9 Widescreen5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound - English 2.0 StereoKarl Grade:Acting - BSetting - A-Special Effects - B+Creep Factor - ATension - C-What The Heck Moments - Disturbing themes, mediocre otherwise.Overall - C-Scar 3-D is one of those films that has a tremendous amount of potential, but comes up lacking at the end of the day. The concept of your torture, and even death, being in the hands of your tortured friend, whose own well being is controlled by your ability to withstand punishment is disturbing and terrifying. To have your life at the hands of someone whose life is in your tortured hands is scarier than being in the hands of a psychopath. But they took this concept and buried it in mediocrity, and the obvious of plot gimmicks.Surrounded by a young up-and-coming cast, Angela Bettis turns in a believable performance as the soul, tortured by the death of her friend, and Christopher Titus, known for his comedic roles, is excellent as the father and brother who must hold the remaining family together.

1397293,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B004DNWPKS,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[1, 1]","Joan Burrows (Angela Bettis looking like a roughed up version of Christina Ricci) returns to her home town of Ovid for a reunion with family. She is haunted by past memories (and a facial scar), about a weird slasher named Bishop (Ben Cotton) who killed her friend as well as giving her a scar. The flashbacks are used to make comparisons with Bishop, the killer, and somewhat creepy kid named Paul (Devon Graye) who is a friend of her niece Olympia (Kirby Bliss Blanton). Paul's dad (James D. Hopkin) is a bit of a psycho from being in Iraq.Meanwhile teens have a graduation party. Drinking, pot smoking, and a girl(thank you Kristin Kowalski) who strips down to her panties and says, ""Howard! Come here and take my virginity. I'm not graduating with it!""As in any good teen slasher movie, kids by the lake who want to have sex... The body count rises, but we don't get to see the killer, nor the kids being tortured. Instead we get flashbacks to the Burrows/Bishop torture. Don't worry, if you missed Joan Burrows getting her face cut, they show it again. The theme of the murders is ""would you kill a friend to save yourself."" However the movie rarely delves into that theme, rather it just shows us dead bodies.The film culminates in a far too predictable poorly written ending.",3,WOULD YOU KILL A FRIEND TO SAVE YOURSELF?,1342569600,"07 18, 2012",2012,1282,"['Joan', 'Burrows', 'Angela', 'Bettis', 'looking', 'roughed', 'up', 'version', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'home', 'town', 'Ovid', 'reunion', 'family', 'haunted', 'past', 'memories', 'facial', 'scar', 'weird', 'slasher', 'named', 'Bishop', 'Ben', 'Cotton', 'who', 'killed', 'friend', 'as', 'well', 'giving', 'scar', 'flashbacks', 'are', 'used', 'make', 'comparisons', 'Bishop', 'killer', 'somewhat', 'creepy', 'kid', 'named', 'Paul', 'Devon', 'Graye', 'who', 'friend', 'niece', 'Olympia', 'Kirby', 'Bliss', 'Blanton', 'Paul', 'dad', 'James', 'D.', 'Hopkin', 'bit', 'psycho', 'being', 'Iraq.Meanwhile', 'teens', 'have', 'graduation', 'party', 'Drinking', 'pot', 'smoking', 'girl', 'Kristin', 'Kowalski', 'who', 'strips', 'down', 'panties', 'Howard', 'Come', 'here', 'take', 'virginity', ""'m"", 'not', 'graduating', 'good', 'teen', 'slasher', 'movie', 'kids', 'lake', 'who', 'want', 'have', 'sex', 'body', 'count', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'killer', 'kids', 'being', 'tortured', 'Instead', 'get', 'flashbacks', 'Burrows/Bishop', 'torture', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'missed', 'Joan', 'Burrows', 'getting', 'face', 'cut', 'show', 'again', 'theme', 'murders', 'would', 'kill', 'friend', 'save', 'However', 'movie', 'rarely', 'theme', 'rather', 'just', 'dead', 'bodies.The', 'film', 'culminates', 'far', 'too', 'predictable', 'poorly', 'written', 'ending']",Scar 2D

After finally returning to her hometown after escaping a serial killer, Joan (Bettis) notices things that are all too familier.  This movie goes back and forth between flashbacks and present day.  As a teen Joan and her best friend are taken and brutaly tortured by a sadistic man.  In order to get the torture to stop Joan must tell him to kill her friend.  Upon returning to her hometown, Joan begins to witness dead bodies piling up and it seems all too familier.  She begins to wonder if the person she thought she killed years ago is actually dead.  Honstly I expected this to be totally lame.  It was not that bad.  It was very gory, but it also had a plot, which doesn't always go hand-in-hand.  The use of flashback is pretty well done.  This is not an edge-of-your-seat type movie, but it will keep you watching until the end, as well as keep you entertained. This is another movie this week that surprised me.  I give it a B-.",3,"A very gory serial killer movie along the lines of ""Saw"", equally as good as the later ones.  Much better then expected.
