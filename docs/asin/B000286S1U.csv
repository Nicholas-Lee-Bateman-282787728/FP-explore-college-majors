826365,A20IIR0422G3A5,B000286S1U,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[11, 14]","`Tiptoes' is a rare social commentary and comedy which takes on what may be one of the very few personal problems not yet explored in a film. As interracial and interfaith relations have been explored up the wazoo, the very premise of this movie raises a little grim. The basic plot is driven by difficulties between a normal sized couple where the man has dwarfism in his genes and is afraid to admit it to their partner until it may be too late. That is, until the woman has become pregnant. The title, then, is a double entendre on dwarfs standing on tiptoe to come closer to normal height and the manner in which normal sized people tiptoe around the subject of dwarfism, especially in conversations with `little people'.After `Lord of the Rings' where six normal sized actors are represented as sub 4 foot tall hobbits and one dwarf in the company of normally tall characters, it was almost expected that this technique would be used in other movies, so that `little people' can be represented my major name actors. In this case, it should be almost no surprise whatsoever that the top billing given to the actor in the dwarf role goes to Gary Oldman who has made a speciality of really oddball roles, mostly as villains, and mostly with heavy makeup and costuming. This is not the kind of movie I normally look forward to seeing, but the prospect of seeing another Oldman performance decided the issue. He is certainly among my favorite hard case actors, along with Mickey Rourke, Steve Buscemi, and Harvey Keitel. In this movie, aside from his small stature, Oldman plays the role straight up. In fact, the whole movie makes no cheap jokes whatsoever over the premise and over dwarfs. The closest the movie comes to an easy laugh is when the woman's (Beckinsale) normal sized parents meet the man's (McConaughey) dwarf parents and brother (Oldman) for the first time, and the woman's mother strains to bring up a delicate subject.This movie probably casts more dwarf actors than any since either `The Wizard of Oz' or the more recent `Legend'. And, unlike either of those two fantasy movies, this movie deals with all the mostly good and sometimes loutish side of dwarf characters. I sincerely do not understand why the dwarf actor, Peter Dinklage, playing the most important dwarf role next to Oldman does not get a credit tacked onto the end of the names of the four normal sized actors. He appears on the screen longer than Patricia Arquette, with whom he maintains a plainly sexual relation through most of the movie. The relation between Arquette and Dinklage plays as a kind of counterpoint to the relation between Beckinsale and McConaughey, almost like the comic relief provided by the amateur troupe of actors in `A MidSummer's Night Dream' play to the much more serious goings on between the young human lovers and the spirits of the forest.Aside from Oldman's transformation into a dwarf, the movie makes almost no effort to disguise incongruous facts about the actors and their roles. The engaged couple have a Jewish wedding, while both actors are about as Irish Catholic as you can possibly imagine. Also, while Oldman and McConaughey are plotted as literally biological twins, Oldman is obviously several years older than McConaughey.While this is not a thriller, and while you sometimes wonder whether the movie is really going anywhere, it does arrive at a surprising conclusion which is consistent with it's primary theme, where it is the man with the dwarf genes who has a problem with the dwarf child, while the normal mother accepts the child and deals with the medical problems which accompany a child growing up with dwarfism.Movies with a social conscience tend to entertain me less than a good action, suspense, horror, or sci-fi flick, but I can see and appreciate the skill of the writer and actors in this movie, and I can enjoy another addition to the collection of unusual Gary Oldman performances. I relish the thought of Oldman's getting together to make a movie with Quentin Tarantino. Yum.This movie is well crafted and entertaining, but not quite a classic.",3,Good Treatment of Unusual Subject.

826369,A2FDFWRBCU8ERY,B000286S1U,Daddy,"[1, 1]","I am dismayed to see so many low ratings and critical reviews for this movie. It's a damn fine movie.  The basic premise is; Steven (played adequately by Matthew McConaughey) is a normal-size man - from a family of dwarfs.  Gary Oldman shines in a very convincing role as Rolfe, his dwarf brother. (They use camera effects to make him seem much shorter and smaller.) Steven is ashamed of his dwarf family and fears having a dwarf child with his new fiance Carol (played very well by Kate Beckinsale).  Carol, her parents, and many others are surprisingly accepting and caring when it comes to their introduction to the world of little people. Only Steven, with his genetic dwarfism background, is ashamed of his own people. And when Carol and Steven get married and their baby is born a dwarf, Steven begins a destructive path of emotions which ends their marriage. Meanwhile, Carol begins to fall for Steven's brother, Rolfe, who has been a good friend to her the whole time.  There's much more to the story... I'm just outlining the basics. Gary Oldman carries a good portion of the movie with his powerful performance. Also... Peter Dinklage (also in Elf and The Station Agent) does a wonderful job as one of Rolfe's buddies, Maurice, a French biker rebel who meets a hitchhiker, Lucy (Patricia Arquette) and has an intense relationship with her. There are many interesting facets to the story, almost stories within stories, and a very human approach to the lives of little people - that they are not novelties to be smirked at, but rather human and real, with real drama and tragedy in their lives. This is a great movie. I might have given it five stars, except for the poor acting ability of Mathew McConaughey... Otherwise, it's a terrific movie.",4,Gary Oldman is great!,1358812800,"01 22, 2013",2013,1754,"['am', 'dismayed', 'see', 'so', 'many', 'low', 'ratings', 'critical', 'reviews', 'movie', 'damn', 'fine', 'movie', 'basic', 'premise', 'Steven', 'played', 'adequately', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'normal-size', 'man', 'family', 'dwarfs', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'very', 'convincing', 'role', 'Rolfe', 'dwarf', 'brother', 'use', 'camera', 'effects', 'make', 'seem', 'much', 'shorter', 'smaller', 'Steven', 'ashamed', 'dwarf', 'family', 'fears', 'having', 'dwarf', 'child', 'new', 'fiance', 'Carol', 'played', 'very', 'well', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'Carol', 'parents', 'many', 'others', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'accepting', 'caring', 'when', 'introduction', 'world', 'little', 'people', 'Only', 'Steven', 'genetic', 'dwarfism', 'background', 'ashamed', 'own', 'people', 'when', 'Carol', 'Steven', 'get', 'married', 'baby', 'born', 'dwarf', 'Steven', 'destructive', 'path', 'emotions', 'ends', 'marriage', 'Meanwhile', 'Carol', 'fall', 'Steven', 'brother', 'Rolfe', 'who', 'been', 'good', 'friend', 'whole', 'time', 'much', 'more', 'story', ""'m"", 'just', 'outlining', 'basics', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'good', 'portion', 'movie', 'powerful', 'performance', 'Also', 'Peter', 'Dinklage', 'also', 'Elf', 'Station', 'Agent', 'wonderful', 'job', 'one', 'Rolfe', 'buddies', 'Maurice', 'French', 'biker', 'rebel', 'who', 'hitchhiker', 'Lucy', 'Patricia', 'Arquette', 'intense', 'relationship', 'are', 'many', 'interesting', 'facets', 'story', 'almost', 'stories', 'stories', 'very', 'human', 'approach', 'lives', 'little', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'novelties', 'be', 'smirked', 'rather', 'human', 'real', 'real', 'drama', 'tragedy', 'lives', 'great', 'movie', 'might', 'have', 'given', 'five', 'stars', 'poor', 'acting', 'ability', 'Mathew', 'McConaughey', 'Otherwise', 'terrific', 'movie']",Tiptoes

The reason it so special is  because it tells a very special story, of which I shall synopsize.Lucy and Steven have been living together and plan to eventually get married.  However, Lucy tells Steven one night that she's pregnant.  Steven is less than thrilled.  He tells Lucy that although he did plan to have a family with her, this is too soon.  He was planning to have children years down the line.  Lucy doesn't understand why he's so upset; they've talked about raising children a hundred times.Lucy gets a life changing surprise the next day when Steven's injured brother, Rolfe, drops by Steven and Lucy's home.  Lucy has alway wondered why Steven has never introduced her to his family.  Rolfe is a dwarf -- a little person.  Lucy asks Rolfe are he and Steven biological brothers.  Rolfe says ""You could say that.  We're twins.""  Clearly they are fraternal twins because Steven is a conventional sized tall man, while Rolfe is clearly a dwarf.  Lucy asks Rolfe if his parents are also little people.  The answer is yes.  Here lies the meat of the story.  The reason Steven never told Lucy about his family is because dwarfism is a genetic condition and Steven and Lucy have the potential to pass on the genes to offspring.This is a story about learning to accept and deal with circumstances in your life that are out of and beyond your control.  I think it's an excellent film for our society to watcha, understand, and learn from.I thought the acting was excellent.  I had no idea McConaughey was this good.  He's really quite an amazing actor.  Does he always get the recognition for that?  Beckinsale was also very moving.  Gary Oldman was fabulous.

The whole side-story with Patricia Arquette in love with one of the dwarves is completely forgotten.  Also, we are led to believe the two main characters have careers as a painter(Kate Beckinsale) and a Navy man(Matthew McConaughey) who now trains firefighters with one scene having her painting and only a couple scenes showing him shouting/speaking to his trainees.  At no time did I believe they were these characters.  Also, Kate Beckinsale, while talented and gorgeous, simply needs better dialogue.  She seems to be forcing the words out while ignoring any or all emotional conotation therein.  In fact, the only performance of any special note here is Matthew McConaughey.  He has a few splendid scenes in which he buries all the other actors attempting to steal the scene from him.  There are a couple of scenes where he is sincerely emotional and the other actors look like deer caught in the headlights of a Mac truck.

Not a bad idea, especially when the gathered cast consists of some of the finest actors who incidentally happen to be dwarves.  But superimpose on this concept the love interest of people of normal height - an edgy artist Carol (Kate Bekinsale, almost unrecognizable in her artsy costumes and hairdo) and a fireman Steven (Matthew McConaughey) - and the problems of victimization cloud the scene.  Only when Carol becomes pregnant does she discover that Steven has a twin brother Rolfe (Gary Oldman in as quiet a role as we'll ever see him!) who happens to be a dwarf.  How this plays out - the coping with the possibility and eventuality that Carol's baby will be born a dwarf - is the serious side of the tale.  Enough said of plot: further information would taint the viewer.  The saving grace of this film lies in the hands of the supporting cast of dwarves (yes, Gary Oldman plays a little person - and very well!).  The enormously gifted Peter Dinklage takes Patricia Arquette as a girlfriend, the parents of Steven and Rolfe are a delight as are their friends, and the bits of humor that dot the screenplay involve the coming together of Carol's and Steven's parents to plan a wedding!

He plays one of two twin brothers, one of whom grows up to be a dwarf, a free lance writer with a column syndicated in the Chicago Tribune.  That's the character Gary Oldman plays.  I was astonished to see him so short in this movie.  Are special effects of this kind so inexpensive now that they could be lavished even in a movie which otherwise looks like it cost maybe $4 million dollars, in other words, hardly anything in today's big budget Hollywood?  Sometimes Oldman was photogaphed in a way which suggested that he was sitting on the ground, for example, in a rauncy motel room he's sitting between two beds while Patricia Arquette is rollingaround having sex with another ""little"" actor, the French Marxist firebrand, ""Maurice,"" played by Peter Dinklage, who runs away with the whole movie with his preposterous ""French"" accent saying, ""Ze marriage is for ze morons!""I liked Dinklage's performance.  I wonder if they could use reverse special effects as cast him as a man of normal height and all the other actors could be magically shrunk to his height like the hobbit boys in LORD OF THE RINGS.  Patricia Arquette as ""Lucy"" looks rough, like she slept the whole night out in the woods the evening before she reported for duty on TIPTOES.

Kate Beckinsdale shines as always in this story and Gary Oldman was fantastic!  His metamorphasis and physical challenges for this role are amazing!  Matthew McConaughey was wasted and disappointing.  Near the end, the movie finally deals with the heavily emotional charged story of two average people having a dwarf child because the of the father's background - he comes from a family of dwarfs.  This part was great and the whole movie should have started from here.  However, it choose to randomly target issues that ran all over the place but never really formed a cohesive plot (the physical pain associated with dwarfism, the twin brother issue with one being a dwarf and one average, the average child's denial of his family, the political association of the dwarf cause - which I still don't know what it is?).

A fine cast rises above the predictable plotting, but director Matthew Bright seems to be saying, ""Look, we're doing a really different kind of film with dwarves as the heroes, and look how nasty ""normal"" people are to these suffering people.  On one hand, the dwarves are heroically postured as being people who physically suffer due to their ""deformity""; on the other hand, they are portrayed almost saintly and without any real cares in the world.  It also throws in the added implausibility of Matthew McConaughey as the only ""tall person"" in a family of dwarves.  When his main squeeze Kate Beckinsale becomes pregnant, McConaughey is afraid their offspring will be a dwarf too, and this is hard for him to accept.  Meanwhile Beckinsale develops a strong kinship with McConaughey's ""twin"" brother (marvelously etched out by Gary Oldman in a bizarre physical transformation), and the viewer doesn't need Cliff Notes to see where this will end up.

I knew all this and it sounded so bad that I had to see it because sometimes things can be so bad that they become good in a unique way.The plotline is somewhat unique, a couple that is having a baby and they're worried that the baby will be a dwarf since the normal sized husband comes from a family of dwarves.  There's a very weird and uncomfortable side plot but it essentially was not even part of the movie and it's absolute garbage.So, terrible effects and stupid casting aside this movie is still awful, it's a lot of very good actors at their very worst. The costumes are outlandish but in a very poor way, the outfits look more often than not like something drug out of the garbage can behind a Goodwill. All of the characters are extremely annoying and unrealistic as well as the dialogue. They're worried about having a dwarf baby but they act like it's going to be an unearthly beast even though they are completely comfortable around dwarves at any other point in time.This movie is only 90 minutes but it drug on to a point I rechecked the length cause I could have swore that multiple hours had passed.  I didn't lose respect for the cast, they have bills to pay but the director should be absolutely ashamed of himself, the only place this movie belongs is the garbage.

826387,A2K3ZJWLF0V4K,B000286S1U,"Rachel Holland ""miribeau""","[0, 0]","To put it plainly, this is a film in which the pivotal role of a dwarf is played by Gary Oldman, waddling around on his knees with the help of a cane. Other, actual, dwarves are relegated to limited and inexplicably comedic roles with Peter Dinklage playing the most substantial of the roles for real dwarves, a random man whose inclusion in the story defies explanation. Why Dinklage would participate in this is beyond me as he is hardly unemployed. Many dwarf actors face such difficulty and cannot be faulted for taking the work but when he walked on set and saw the Oldman shuffle (did I mention he walks on his knees throughout the film, faking being a dwarf) I am surprised that he did not turn around and go home. In fact, I'm surprised the entire case and crew did not go on strike at seeing such an offensive display of bigotry.Similar to the exceptional nausea experienced when watching Al Jolson in The Jazz Singer and C. Thomas Howell in Soul Man, sporting their versions of Black Face, I found myself pausing this to pop some Dramamine and, when that didn't work, some Meclizine, just to make my way through this genuine horror show. I haven't been this offended since watching a very white Kate Hepburn in Yellow Face as a Chinese girl in Dragon Seed and that came out during World War II.How could Oldman do this role, day after day, on his knees, playing at being a dwarf? How much less than his most special and super talented self must Gary Oldman find dwarf actors to be, that he would have the gall to act on his knees while Warwick Davis waits in the wings and Peter Dinklage waits in the wings and every other talented male dwarf actor you can think of waits in the wings ready and able to NOT walk on their knees in a film about supposed acceptance of midgets and dwarves. Not to mention the fact that Oldman's role, as the fraternal twin of Matthew McConaughey could have been better played by Dinklage himself, who was actually born in the same year as McConaughey and not eleven years earlier as Oldman was.I don't know if I'll ever look at Oldman the same way again. Actually, I'm pretty sure I won't. And what in the world were McConaughey and Beckinsale thinking? What, Beckinsale wouldn't ever really be attracted to Dinklage or Davis or any other highly talented male dwarf actor because she's so bigoted that they had to cast Gary Oldman to make her feel less icky?

The only problem is that when Steven goes out at night he won't tell Lucy where he's going. Turns out he's going to Little People Conventions since his entire family, except for himself, are dwarfs. Meanwhile, Steven's twin brother Rolfe (Gary Oldman) is on a motorcycle trip with his best friend Maurice (Peter Dinklage). The trip comes to an abrupt end when Maurice picks up a hippy prostitute (Patricia Arquette). Tiring of the noise, Rolfe decides to pay an ex-girlfriend (Bridget Powerz) a visit. Things don't go according to plan and Rolfe gets badly beaten by her current lover. Hoping to recuperate at his big brother's he instead discovers Lucy who eventually learns about everything Steven has been keeping from her. Lucy is pissed at first but with a little open mindedness she begins to accept Rolfe and the rest of Steven's family. When she becomes pregnant Steven fears their child will be born a dwarf and loses his mind. His subsequent actions are shocking and devastating to his family. The film is  strange partly because of it's handling of dwarfism but mainly because the intended comedy isn't funny. Thankfully the filmmakers don't make fun of little people but show them in a positive light not seen on film before. I assume we're supposed to laugh at the sight of Arquette as a New Age nut or at Dinklage as a murderous Frenchman but I didn't. It's not funny it's distracting. They're both fine actors but rather than add anything to the film they take away from it. This is a nice role for Oldman since he gets to show off his tender and vulnerable side. Rolfe is a heartbreaking character who longs to be accepted by his big brother but instead finds comfort in Lucy. David Lynch regular Michael J. Anderson is also given a wonderful opportunity to show a different side of himself playing Rolfe and Steven's proud papa. I really  hated the ending, but then again I can't say I liked anything that preceded it.

He plays Rolfe, a journalist and dwarf brother to a fire-fighter instructor Steven played by Matthew McConaughey. Steven happens to be the only member of his family who is not a dwarf, but he hasn't told his girlfriend Carol (Kate Beckinsale) about the presence of his brother or anything about his family. But when Carol becomes pregnant, he knows he has to tell, but is still slow to do that.The premise is intriguing in several ways - amiable Steven hesitates to talk about his family, but why? for instance - but the film, which starts off pretty interesting, gradually veers from the topic, not knowing the story it has to tell.I know Matthew McConaughey is a talented actor, but I am afraid his acting here is far from his best. He should not be blamed, however, as his character is so underwritten and the romance with his girlfriend so undeveloped that I couldn't understand why she was attracted to him in the first place. The same can be said about the relation between Oldman's Rolfe and Beckinsale's Carol, one of the pivotal themes of the film, I think, but ""Tiptoes"" gives only about 10 minutes (out of 90) to depict its process, which should be treated with more details.Supporting actors turn in fine performances, especially Peter Dinklage as Maurice a radical French, but the subplot concerning his love/hate relations with Patricia Arquette's character just goes nowhere, abruptly cut short before it really interests us.
