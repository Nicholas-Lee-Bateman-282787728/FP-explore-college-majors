Okay, I am on a huge Dom adams kick, so I'm snapping up whatever I can find.  I ran across this - and was disappointed. Yes, I loved seeing Don back in action as Agent 86 again, and the premise of the film was, er, interesting.  Ahem.I could forgive the absence of Edward Platt.  After all, he passed away in 1974.  I couldn't really overlook the absence of Barbara Feldon, and Max's resulting playboy attitude.  It just made the character seem that much more flawed.In addition, the script is not so much a coherent narrative as it is an excuse to recycle everyone's favorite gags form the original ""Get Smart"" series.  There was way too much 12-cent slapstick.  Max could be counted to run into just about every fixed object on any given set face first.  Okay, so he was meant to be a bumbling detective, but this was too much, and again, it diluted the character.There were some genuinely original moments, most notably Max's high-speed (if not exactly street-legal) desk, but they were few and far between.The only thing that makes this film worth watching at all is Don Adams himself.  Although handed a sow's ear, he manages to do a reasonably decent job of trying to make a silk purse out of it, and almost carries it off - with all the charm, aplomb, and humor we came to expect of him.  I quite liked the dialogue betweem Max and Larabee - Larabee's paln to defeat the bomb is priceless.  Sadly it isn't enough to save the movie.It's a guilty pleasure for Don Adams fans, but not much else.

Would you believe you can get a collection of 8 much-funnier Abbott & Costello features for less? Would you believe I would have given this DVD a three-star rating if only it were less than ten bucks?I first saw THE NUDE BOMB on its initial theatrical release in 1980, in a crowded theater. While the audience guffawed appreciatively all the way through the picture, I only found myself chuckling and laughing intermittently. Maybe this audience wasn't as familiar with the TV series as I was, because I came away thinking this was a misfire. Don Adams was a gifted comedic actor and a pitch-perfect Maxwell Smart, but without crucial characters such as Agent 99 (Barbara Feldon), The Chief (Edward Platt, who died in 1974), and Siegfried (Bernie Kopell) for Adams to play off of, THE NUDE BOMB couldn't possibly achieve the TV series' level of comic brilliance.As Don Adams lamented in later interviews, THE NUDE BOMB was made by a studio that didn't comprehend the appeal or intent of the original series -- and it shows. Even the title reveals this lack of understanding. In Europe the film was released as THE RETURN OF MAXWELL SMART -- a much better title, in my opinion -- yet in the U.S. it was distributed as THE NUDE BOMB, which makes it sound like a cheap softcore grindhouse flick.Nevertheless, I don't believe THE NUDE BOMB is a terrible film. Don Adams tries hard to make the best of a less-than-ideal situation, and he manages to inject some laughs into this diluted affair. There are some clever and amusing moments, and a casual viewer may find it an agreeable spy-movie satire.

GET SMART is hands down the greatest series in the history of American television (and most likely it's future), so it's easy to see the appeal of a chance to revisit Maxwell Smart's world.but what exactly was the appeal of doing such a half-assed job? i've seen episodes of THE SMURFS that bore more resemblance to the classic series than this debacle. only one regular besided Don Adams returns, namely Bob ""Larrabee"" Karvelas, and one frankly doubts that even he would've made it, were he not Don Adams' cousin. why was no attempt made to re-recruit 99, to say nothing of Siegfried or Hymie the robot?but the casting is only a fraction of the problem. despite a ""written by"" credit for three GET SMART veterans (Arne Sultan, Bill Dana, and Leonard Stern, specifically), the damn thing doesn't come off as the work of someone who understands, or has even seen, the classic series. for instance, Max is transferred from CONTROL to an agency called PITS...as if they'd completely missed the cornerstone idea of the struggle between the forces of KAOS and CONTROL. one of the most basic puns, jettisoned completely!one can only assume bringing Max into the budgetary realm of a James Bond appealed to someone...but more so than doing it right? did someone actually not mind the possibility of of said budget coming at the expense of quality of product? well, that sort of thing has happened before, hasn't it?the good news is, they did manage to do so right a few years ago, via Steve Carrell, Anne Hathaway, Alan Arkin, and Terrance Stamp. granted, Don Adams had to die (the film was made as a sort of tribute), but then, since when did cinema magic not have it's price?",1,MISSED IT BYYYYYY...a hell of a lot more than usual,1339459200,"06 12, 2012",2012,1736,"['money', 'Industry', 'all-time', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'GET', 'SMART', 'hands', 'down', 'greatest', 'series', 'history', 'American', 'television', 'most', 'likely', 'future', 'easy', 'see', 'appeal', 'chance', 'revisit', 'Maxwell', 'Smart', 'world.but', 'what', 'exactly', 'was', 'appeal', 'doing', 'such', 'half-assed', 'job', 'i', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'episodes', 'THE', 'SMURFS', 'bore', 'more', 'resemblance', 'classic', 'series', 'debacle', 'only', 'one', 'regular', 'besided', 'Don', 'Adams', 'returns', 'namely', 'Bob', 'Larrabee', 'Karvelas', 'one', 'frankly', 'even', 'would', ""'ve"", 'made', 'were', 'not', 'Don', 'Adams', 'cousin', 'why', 'was', 'attempt', 'made', 're-recruit', '99', 'say', 'nothing', 'Siegfried', 'Hymie', 'robot', 'casting', 'only', 'fraction', 'problem', 'written', 'credit', 'three', 'GET', 'SMART', 'veterans', 'Arne', 'Sultan', 'Bill', 'Dana', 'Leonard', 'Stern', 'specifically', 'damn', 'thing', ""n't"", 'come', 'off', 'work', 'someone', 'who', 'even', 'seen', 'classic', 'series', 'instance', 'Max', 'transferred', 'CONTROL', 'agency', 'called', 'PITS', ""'d"", 'completely', 'missed', 'cornerstone', 'idea', 'struggle', 'forces', 'KAOS', 'CONTROL', 'one', 'most', 'basic', 'puns', 'jettisoned', 'completely', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'bringing', 'Max', 'budgetary', 'realm', 'James', 'Bond', 'appealed', 'someone', 'more', 'so', 'doing', 'right', 'did', 'someone', 'actually', 'not', 'mind', 'possibility', 'said', 'budget', 'coming', 'expense', 'quality', 'product', 'well', 'sort', 'thing', 'happened', ""n't"", 'good', 'news', 'did', 'manage', 'do', 'so', 'right', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'Steve', 'Carrell', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'Terrance', 'Stamp', 'granted', 'Don', 'Adams', 'had', 'die', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'sort', 'tribute', 'then', 'when', 'did', 'cinema', 'magic', 'not', 'have', 'price']",N/A

So the movie is not a total flop as Max is given a mission to seek out where KAOS is hiding a bomb that when ignited, removes clothing, and KAOS threaten to use it to take over the fashion world.However, what is missing here is familiar faces from the series, especially Barbra Feldon as 99. It is completely wrong that 99 is not here, and that Max has a new love interest in a completely different leading lady.Had they have gotten Barbra to do the movie, or if the leading lady was NOT a love interest of Max's, this film would be considered great. But fans of the series will not swallow Max not being with 99, so that is where this movie fell hard on it's rear end.Almost ten years after this, a re-union movie was made called, ""Get Smart Again"" and had 99 and as many familiar faces as they could get who where still around or hadn't passed on yet.Definitely pick up that one, but as for this one, the only way I can make myself watch this one is to either ignore scenes with the new gal, or pretend it was supposed to be a prequel to when the series started.Some parts where funny, some where recycled jokes from the TV series, but this movie of the return of Maxwell Smart was just a bad mistake with the directions they chose to go in. Even Don Adams himself said he wished he had not done this movie.Get Smart was originally designed as a comedic version of James Bond, but as the character grew, it was set that Max only had one women, and wasn't the type to always have a new leading lady every week to fall in love with and have disappear without a trace the next.

From people hating it to liking it to loving it, it was pretty complicated to decide.  But being the Don Adams fan that I am I did the smartest thing... Okay,I bought it.I saw that he didn't exactly play Maxwell Smart but more like an Austin Powers type, women falling all over him, the strange colorful villian that clones himself, but Adams didn't get too Risqu&eacute; with the sexual talk like Austin Powers did.  But overall I happen to think that this movie was pretty funny.  I missed not seeing Barbara Feldman but my favorite scenes was the beginning of the film (very James Bondish) Him driving the desk all over the road after the bad guy and towards the end when Adams and the villian kept cloning themselves and you can even see a mini-Max for a few seconds.So you can love it, you can hate it, but I personally thought it was a very entertaining spy spoof.",5,A Pretty Funny Movie,1216252800,"07 17, 2008",2008,954,"['purchasing', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'read', 'lot', 'reviews', 'different', 'sites', 'people', 'hating', 'liking', 'loving', 'was', 'pretty', 'complicated', 'decide', 'being', 'Don', 'Adams', 'fan', 'am', 'did', 'smartest', 'thing', 'Okay', 'bought', 'it.I', 'saw', 'did', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'play', 'Maxwell', 'Smart', 'more', 'Austin', 'Powers', 'type', 'women', 'falling', 'strange', 'colorful', 'villian', 'Adams', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'too', 'Risqu', 'eacute', 'sexual', 'talk', 'Austin', 'Powers', 'did', 'overall', 'happen', 'think', 'movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'funny', 'missed', 'not', 'seeing', 'Barbara', 'Feldman', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'was', 'beginning', 'film', 'very', 'James', 'Bondish', 'Him', 'driving', 'desk', 'road', 'bad', 'guy', 'end', 'when', 'Adams', 'villian', 'kept', 'cloning', 'can', 'even', 'see', 'mini-Max', 'few', 'seconds.So', 'can', 'love', 'can', 'hate', 'personally', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'entertaining', 'spy', 'spoof']",N/A
