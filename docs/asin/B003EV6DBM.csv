Doyle ""Sniperbait1966""","[0, 0]","I've been watching the Doctor since my days at the University Of Colorado at Colorado Springs, when the Doctor was fairly new here thanks to PBS. That was a very looong time ago. William Hartnell to John Hurt, John Hurt? That's right the next Doctor is going to be John Hurt. I will withhold judgement until I've seen what this noted actor brings to the milieu. Matt Smith, Karen Gillan, Arthur Darvill and Alex Kingston Are superb in their roles and work together so well as to make the entire experience of Doctor Who as exciting as ever. Matt Smith is another great Doctor, season five, just another astounding season of great fun and drama.

1338775,A2OZBJ58CML9OS,B003EV6DBM,A. Gammill,"[210, 245]","OK, it's a little premature to judge something that hasn't been released yet.  And I'm sure I'll make a few additions to this review when the set is released.  In the meantime, this review is meant to enlighten you about Series 5 of Doctor Who.I'm sure I wasn't the only fan who was skeptical that this lanky upstart Matt ""Who?"" Smith (Ha! Did you see what I did there?) could replace the wonderful 10th Doctor, played by David Tennant.  But we long-time fans have come to accept that the role of the Doctor is going to change every few years.  And in the case of Matt Smith, the role couldn't be in better hands.But Doctor Who doesn't just have a new face in front of the camera; Steven Moffat, writer of such modern-day DW classics like ""Blink"" and ""The Girl in the Fireplace"" took over the showrunner position from Russell T. Davies.  And again, the show couldn't be in better hands.  Moffat has been very vocal about his reimagining of the series as a sort of dark fairy tale.  And this is evident right from the start, as the TARDIS crash-lands in the back year of 8 year old Amy Pond.  The figurative monster under Amy's bed is actually a crack in her wall, one that will have cosmic consequences throughout the season.New companion Karen Gillan (playing the adult version of Amy) brings a spunky kick to the new Doctor's adventures.  Yet one can still see hints of that lost little girl from time to time.  Gillan and Smith perfectly compliment each other, as both appear wise and experienced far beyond their years.  She almost immediately endures herself to the Doctor (and the audience, hopefully) in the 2nd episode, ""The Beast Below,"" by preventing the Doctor from making a terrible mistake.The series touches on more familiar territory--the Daleks, the Weeping Angels, the mysterious River Song--yet stays firmly entrenched in the fantasy world Moffat has helped to create.  As the bowtie-wearing Time Lord, Smith channels Doctors of the past from Patrick Troughton to David Tennant.  He is, as Amy Pond notes in the first episode ""a mad man with a blue box.""  And despite his seemingly unhinged nature, Smith gives the Doctor great dramatic weight when needed. . .whether it's righteous indignation at alien (or human) stupidity, or trying to protect his new companion from the inevitable fate that befalls all his fellow travelers.Doctor Who carries on in fantastic style, and I for one hope that Smith and Gillan stay with their roles for years to come.  I congratulate Steven Moffat and his team for honoring the legacy of Doctor Who, but making it all their own at the same time.  Highly recommended.UPDATE: As expected, the set doesn't disappoint.  Doctor Who began filming in HD in 2009, and the Blu-ray format is perfect for capturing the gorgeous cinematography and excellent effects work.  There are behind-the-scenes features for every episodes, some amusing outtakes, and a few commentary tracks.  And this may be a minor point for many people, but the packaging is really impressive.  The cover features a 3-D lenticular hologram, and there are 3 bonus art prints featuring the Doctor, TARDIS, and a Dalek.  THIS is how you do t.v. on Blu-ray :-)",5,Brilliant revision of a beloved series,1275868800,"06 7, 2010",2010,3172,"['OK', 'little', 'premature', 'judge', 'something', ""n't"", 'been', 'released', 'yet', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'make', 'few', 'additions', 'review', 'when', 'set', 'released', 'meantime', 'review', 'meant', 'enlighten', 'Series', '5', 'Doctor', 'Who.I', ""'m"", 'sure', 'was', ""n't"", 'only', 'fan', 'who', 'was', 'skeptical', 'lanky', 'upstart', 'Matt', 'Who', 'Smith', 'Ha', 'Did', 'see', 'what', 'did', 'there', 'could', 'replace', 'wonderful', '10th', 'Doctor', 'played', 'David', 'Tennant', 'long-time', 'fans', 'have', 'come', 'accept', 'role', 'Doctor', 'going', 'change', 'few', 'years', 'case', 'Matt', 'Smith', 'role', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'better', 'hands.But', 'Doctor', 'Who', ""n't"", 'just', 'have', 'new', 'face', 'front', 'camera', 'Steven', 'Moffat', 'writer', 'such', 'modern-day', 'DW', 'classics', 'Blink', 'Girl', 'Fireplace', 'took', 'showrunner', 'position', 'Russell', 'T.', 'Davies', 'again', 'show', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'better', 'hands', 'Moffat', 'been', 'very', 'vocal', 'reimagining', 'series', 'sort', 'dark', 'fairy', 'tale', 'evident', 'right', 'start', 'TARDIS', 'crash-lands', 'back', 'year', '8', 'year', 'old', 'Amy', 'Pond', 'figurative', 'monster', 'Amy', 'bed', 'actually', 'crack', 'wall', 'one', 'will', 'have', 'cosmic', 'consequences', 'season.New', 'companion', 'Karen', 'Gillan', 'playing', 'adult', 'version', 'Amy', 'spunky', 'kick', 'new', 'Doctor', 'adventures', 'one', 'can', 'still', 'see', 'hints', 'lost', 'little', 'girl', 'time', 'time', 'Gillan', 'Smith', 'perfectly', 'compliment', 'other', 'appear', 'wise', 'experienced', 'far', 'years', 'almost', 'immediately', 'Doctor', 'audience', 'hopefully', '2nd', 'episode', 'Beast', 'Below', 'preventing', 'Doctor', 'making', 'terrible', 'mistake.The', 'series', 'touches', 'more', 'familiar', 'territory', 'Daleks', 'Weeping', 'Angels', 'mysterious', 'River', 'Song', 'yet', 'firmly', 'entrenched', 'fantasy', 'world', 'Moffat', 'helped', 'create', 'bowtie-wearing', 'Time', 'Lord', 'Smith', 'Doctors', 'past', 'Patrick', 'Troughton', 'David', 'Tennant', 'Amy', 'Pond', 'notes', 'first', 'episode', 'mad', 'man', 'blue', 'box', 'seemingly', 'unhinged', 'nature', 'Smith', 'Doctor', 'great', 'dramatic', 'weight', 'when', 'needed', 'righteous', 'indignation', 'alien', 'human', 'stupidity', 'trying', 'protect', 'new', 'companion', 'inevitable', 'fate', 'fellow', 'travelers.Doctor', 'Who', 'fantastic', 'style', 'one', 'hope', 'Smith', 'Gillan', 'stay', 'roles', 'years', 'come', 'congratulate', 'Steven', 'Moffat', 'team', 'honoring', 'legacy', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'making', 'own', 'same', 'time', 'Highly', 'recommended.UPDATE', 'expected', 'set', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'began', 'filming', 'HD', '2009', 'Blu-ray', 'format', 'perfect', 'capturing', 'gorgeous', 'cinematography', 'excellent', 'effects', 'work', 'are', 'behind-the-scenes', 'features', 'episodes', 'amusing', 'outtakes', 'few', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'may', 'be', 'minor', 'point', 'many', 'people', 'packaging', 'really', 'impressive', 'cover', '3-D', 'lenticular', 'hologram', 'are', '3', 'art', 'prints', 'featuring', 'Doctor', 'TARDIS', 'Dalek', 'THIS', 'how', 'do', 't.v', 'Blu-ray']",N/A
1338776,A1LMBOI3T91P87,B003EV6DBM,Allan M. Lees,"[8, 14]","After David Tennant had more or less made The Doctor his own, how would the new cast and crew carrying the franchise forward?  In a word: brilliantly.Transitions are always tricky to pull off.  Russell T Davis took a big gamble when Tennant took over from Ecclestone - a gamble that was almost too clever. To contrast the new Doctor against Ecclestone's dark, almost manic energy, RTD placed the newly regenerated Doctor into a coma, so that Tennant's doctor slept much of the way through the opening scenes. It was intellectually clever but left many viewers feeling a bit over-teased. So the big question was always: how would Moffat handle his turn at the segue?The answer turned out to be far more satisfying than RTD's approach. The opening scenes move fast and furious, mixing humor with undertones of darkness and throwing in subtle, clever little hints (WHERE did that apple come from...?) to the viewer along the way. My family and I were prepared to hate this new Doctor because the trailers had been so very bad, but the first episode swept us up, carried us along, and by the end of the first fifteen minutes we were totally convinced that Series Five wouldn't be a disappointment after all.  Matt Smith's performance is very good indeed, but the real praise is for the script writing, which is of the very highest order.As the series progresses, Moffatt plays with the viewer's expectations, setting things in a direction where we all think, ""oh, I know where this is leading"" and then turning it around 180 degrees to head off in an entirely new direction. The most obvious example of this intentional misleading is with the relationship between The Doctor and Amy. There's probably no viewer on the planet who doesn't have The Doctor and Rose firmly embedded in their consciousness, and for a while it really does look as if we're heading for a reprise. But Moffatt is good, very good. We get the most overtly sexual references ever present in a Doctor Who episode and yet... well, as River Song would say, ""spoilers..."" You'll have to see it for yourself.Best of all, Moffatt embraces the apparent contradiction of a very young actor playing a very old man - and carries it off perfectly. Smith is at his very best when he looks out of his too-old eyes embedded in a young and oddly angular face.While there are moments here & there throughout the series where the pace drops a bit, for the most part this is compulsive viewing. It continues the tradition of optimism and kindness that has been a core element of the series almost since the very beginning but it returns to the darkness that was part of Series One with Ecclestone. In my opinion Doctor Who needs this counterpoint of darkness in order to work really well, and it seems Moffatt is able to supply it.All in all this is a great series and we must hope fervently that the cast and crew can keep up - or even improve on - the very high standard they've set as they go forward into the Christmas Special and the Sixth Series.",5,A Great Continuation of the Series,1283472000,"09 3, 2010",2010,3002,"['David', 'Tennant', 'had', 'more', 'less', 'made', 'Doctor', 'own', 'how', 'would', 'new', 'cast', 'crew', 'carrying', 'franchise', 'forward', 'word', 'brilliantly.Transitions', 'are', 'always', 'tricky', 'pull', 'off', 'Russell', 'T', 'Davis', 'took', 'big', 'gamble', 'when', 'Tennant', 'took', 'over', 'Ecclestone', 'gamble', 'was', 'almost', 'too', 'clever', 'contrast', 'new', 'Doctor', 'Ecclestone', 'dark', 'almost', 'manic', 'energy', 'RTD', 'placed', 'newly', 'regenerated', 'Doctor', 'coma', 'Tennant', 'doctor', 'slept', 'much', 'way', 'opening', 'scenes', 'was', 'intellectually', 'clever', 'left', 'many', 'viewers', 'feeling', 'bit', 'over-teased', 'big', 'question', 'was', 'always', 'how', 'would', 'Moffat', 'handle', 'turn', 'segue', 'answer', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'satisfying', 'RTD', 'approach', 'opening', 'scenes', 'move', 'fast', 'furious', 'mixing', 'humor', 'undertones', 'darkness', 'throwing', 'subtle', 'clever', 'little', 'hints', 'WHERE', 'did', 'apple', 'come', 'viewer', 'way', 'family', 'were', 'prepared', 'hate', 'new', 'Doctor', 'trailers', 'had', 'been', 'so', 'very', 'bad', 'first', 'episode', 'swept', 'up', 'carried', 'end', 'first', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'were', 'totally', 'convinced', 'Series', 'Five', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointment', 'Matt', 'Smith', 'performance', 'very', 'good', 'indeed', 'real', 'praise', 'script', 'writing', 'very', 'highest', 'series', 'Moffatt', 'viewer', 'expectations', 'setting', 'things', 'direction', 'where', 'think', 'oh', 'know', 'where', 'leading', 'then', 'turning', '180', 'degrees', 'head', 'off', 'entirely', 'new', 'direction', 'most', 'obvious', 'example', 'intentional', 'misleading', 'relationship', 'Doctor', 'Amy', 'probably', 'viewer', 'planet', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'Doctor', 'Rose', 'firmly', 'embedded', 'consciousness', 'while', 'really', 'look', ""'re"", 'heading', 'reprise', 'Moffatt', 'good', 'very', 'good', 'get', 'most', 'overtly', 'sexual', 'references', 'ever', 'present', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'episode', 'yet', 'well', 'River', 'Song', 'would', 'say', 'spoilers', ""'ll"", 'have', 'see', 'yourself.Best', 'Moffatt', 'apparent', 'contradiction', 'very', 'young', 'actor', 'playing', 'very', 'old', 'man', 'off', 'perfectly', 'Smith', 'very', 'best', 'when', 'too-old', 'eyes', 'embedded', 'young', 'oddly', 'angular', 'face.While', 'are', 'moments', 'here', 'there', 'series', 'where', 'pace', 'bit', 'most', 'part', 'compulsive', 'viewing', 'tradition', 'optimism', 'kindness', 'been', 'core', 'element', 'series', 'almost', 'very', 'beginning', 'darkness', 'was', 'part', 'Series', 'One', 'Ecclestone', 'opinion', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'counterpoint', 'darkness', 'order', 'work', 'really', 'well', 'Moffatt', 'able', 'supply', 'it.All', 'great', 'series', 'must', 'hope', 'fervently', 'cast', 'crew', 'can', 'keep', 'up', 'even', 'improve', 'very', 'high', 'standard', ""'ve"", 'set', 'go', 'forward', 'Christmas', 'Special', 'Sixth', 'Series']",N/A

Well Matt Smith begins very poorly as the doctor, decent but not great.  By the end of the season he grows into the role, although I still have to say I prefer Eccleston and Tennant, but we are stuck with Smith.  But what is worse than the new doctor is the new companion.  Amy (Amelia) Pond is obnoxious, annoying, and irritating as the doctor's new companion.  All she seems to want to do is try to make out with him for the first few episodes-even though she is engaged I might add.  Another thing is that the show, from this point and on into the sixth season, becomes the Amy Pond Show.  She is smarter than the doctor and the focus of almost every episode and both the fifth seasons series story arc as well as the sixth season's story arc.

In those series, I really enjoyed the diversity of the casting for every episode; the incredible music scoring of each episode; how the characters endured modern struggles - such as Donna being frustrated that she was stuck working as a temp - all those things contributed to a sense of *relatability* to the characters. Moffat's Doctor Who seems to be created inside a much more sterile, narrowly-defined world.On to Matt Smith - he's very good, but would it be too much to ask that the 11th Doctor display even just a smidge of sex appeal! :) Companion Amy Pond - 100% annoying. (I know, I know - heresy.)Writing and direction for the fifth series: was rarely on the edge of my seat. The worst episodes of the RTD era were more compelling than what was offered up as the best of this series.No doubt, though, this dvd collection of series 5 will deliver the goods for Doctor Who fans.

1338806,A3UKTEEU8TWNV7,B003EV6DBM,B. Starbuck,"[5, 10]","... the future of our favorite Time Lord is safe and sound in the capable hands of Matt Smith and Steven Moffat. Yes, we all knew it was going to be tricky watching after the departure of David Tennant, which was a shock to the system, but after thirteen episodes with Smith and Moffat at the helm, I am a believer.The series opens with one of the better season openers of the revived series, 'The Eleventh Hour', and we are introduced to the Doctor's new persona as he descends on Amelia Pond's life and home. Moffat did something really good with this episode: he didn't waste a lot of time on the regeneration and instead dove head first into the action, which I thought was a great decision, especially after the harrowing end to Tennant, and he needed to move Smith in there fast and get people acclimated as quickly as possible. Our introduction to Amelia ~ or Amy ~ as a child, was something new as well, and was a poignant bit of storytelling. As the series progresses, Amy sort of becomes a confusing character, and a bit irritating at times, but I think that was the way she was meant to be written, considering that her life, as the Doctor said, made no sense, up until the final episodes.As for the writing, I think this season was a lot sharper, a lot tighter than the previous four and Moffat and the other writers definitely stepped it up a notch. There were one or two weak spots ~ there always are ~ but on the whole, I think this was the best season yet, especially the episodes penned by Moffat himself. We saw the return of River Song and the Weeping Angels ~ two episodes that will give you the creeps; we saw the return of the Silurians and the Daleks (who just can't seem to go away), the advent of the mysterious Dream Lord, and a few vampire fish thrown in for good measure. One of the finer episodes of this season was 'Vincent and the Doctor' ~ there was something very touching about that episode and it was beautifully written. The two-part finale was the best of the finales of the current show, and there was something very visceral about that Pandorica and what it was designed for.Now to Smith. Well, when I first heard about his casting, I was more than a little skeptical. He seemed too young for the role and I knew he would either make or break the future of the revived series. Luckily, he made it. His portrayal of the Doctor is breath of fresh air, I think. After Tennant's reign, I think Whovians needed to be reminded of the fact that the Doctor is NOT a human, as much as we love him and wish he were. We needed to be reminded of his alienness, and Matt Smith has done that in a brilliant fashion, while maintaining a certain empathy and affection for those in his company; however, he's quirky, he's weird, he's random, he's explosive, he's arrogant, he has an old-soul quality... he's all the things that the Doctor should be as the last of the Time Lords, the last of his species, and this series deserves the five stars for Smith's portrayal alone, because it CANNOT have been easy, especially on the heels of the most popular Doctor ever (Tennant). And if you quit watching just because Tennant left, well, that's a shame, because you don't know what you're missing.In closing, I loved the new series, I love Matt Smith, I adore Steven Moffat, and I think we can all breathe a huge sigh of relief... and I CANNOT WAIT to see who exactly River Song turns out to be...",5,"Deep breath, everyone...",1280016000,"07 25, 2010",2010,3414,"['future', 'favorite', 'Time', 'Lord', 'safe', 'sound', 'capable', 'hands', 'Matt', 'Smith', 'Steven', 'Moffat', 'Yes', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'tricky', 'watching', 'departure', 'David', 'Tennant', 'was', 'shock', 'system', 'thirteen', 'episodes', 'Smith', 'Moffat', 'helm', 'am', 'believer.The', 'series', 'one', 'better', 'season', 'openers', 'revived', 'series', 'Eleventh', 'Hour', 'are', 'introduced', 'Doctor', 'new', 'persona', 'Amelia', 'Pond', 'life', 'home', 'Moffat', 'did', 'something', 'really', 'good', 'episode', 'did', ""n't"", 'waste', 'lot', 'time', 'regeneration', 'instead', 'dove', 'head', 'first', 'action', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'decision', 'especially', 'harrowing', 'end', 'Tennant', 'needed', 'move', 'Smith', 'fast', 'get', 'people', 'acclimated', 'as', 'quickly', 'possible', 'introduction', 'Amelia', '~', 'Amy', '~', 'child', 'was', 'something', 'new', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'poignant', 'bit', 'storytelling', 'series', 'Amy', 'sort', 'becomes', 'confusing', 'character', 'bit', 'irritating', 'times', 'think', 'was', 'way', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'written', 'considering', 'life', 'Doctor', 'said', 'made', 'sense', 'up', 'final', 'episodes.As', 'writing', 'think', 'season', 'was', 'lot', 'sharper', 'lot', 'tighter', 'previous', 'four', 'Moffat', 'other', 'writers', 'definitely', 'stepped', 'up', 'notch', 'were', 'one', 'two', 'weak', 'spots', '~', 'always', 'are', '~', 'whole', 'think', 'was', 'best', 'season', 'yet', 'especially', 'episodes', 'penned', 'Moffat', 'saw', 'return', 'River', 'Song', 'Weeping', 'Angels', '~', 'two', 'episodes', 'will', 'give', 'creeps', 'saw', 'return', 'Silurians', 'Daleks', 'who', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'go', 'away', 'advent', 'mysterious', 'Dream', 'Lord', 'few', 'vampire', 'fish', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure', 'One', 'finer', 'episodes', 'season', 'was', ""'Vincent"", 'Doctor', '~', 'was', 'something', 'very', 'touching', 'episode', 'was', 'beautifully', 'written', 'two-part', 'finale', 'was', 'best', 'finales', 'current', 'show', 'was', 'something', 'very', 'visceral', 'Pandorica', 'what', 'was', 'designed', 'for.Now', 'Smith', 'Well', 'when', 'first', 'heard', 'casting', 'was', 'more', 'little', 'skeptical', 'seemed', 'too', 'young', 'role', 'knew', 'would', 'either', 'make', 'break', 'future', 'revived', 'series', 'Luckily', 'made', 'portrayal', 'Doctor', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'think', 'Tennant', 'reign', 'think', 'Whovians', 'needed', 'be', 'reminded', 'fact', 'Doctor', 'NOT', 'human', 'as', 'much', 'love', 'wish', 'were', 'needed', 'be', 'reminded', 'alienness', 'Matt', 'Smith', 'done', 'brilliant', 'fashion', 'maintaining', 'certain', 'empathy', 'affection', 'company', 'however', 'quirky', 'weird', 'random', 'explosive', 'arrogant', 'old-soul', 'quality', 'things', 'Doctor', 'should', 'be', 'last', 'Time', 'Lords', 'last', 'species', 'series', 'five', 'stars', 'Smith', 'portrayal', 'alone', 'CAN', 'NOT', 'have', 'been', 'easy', 'especially', 'heels', 'most', 'popular', 'Doctor', 'ever', 'Tennant', 'quit', 'watching', 'just', 'Tennant', 'left', 'well', 'shame', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'missing.In', 'closing', 'loved', 'new', 'series', 'love', 'Matt', 'Smith', 'adore', 'Steven', 'Moffat', 'think', 'can', 'all', 'breathe', 'huge', 'sigh', 'relief', 'CAN', 'NOT', 'WAIT', 'see', 'who', 'exactly', 'River', 'Song', 'out', 'be']",N/A

Pretty much everything has been changed and this is for the better.We start off with ""The Eleventh Hour"", showing our new hero, our new TARDIS, and new companion in the form of Amy. The story itself was reasonably interesting and the execution was ok. It wasn't anything really great, but it was a solid start, and I loved seeing glimpses of all the previous Doctors (except, tellingly, number 10).From there we go to ""The Beast Below"" and get the impression straight-away that perhaps Davies is back. There wasn't really anything great about this episode. It wasn't horribly offensive, but it was a bit twee and very lacking. I did enjoy the Doctor's moral choice at the end, but that was about it.Then we arrive at ""Victory of the Daleks"". I do like the ""X of the Daleks"" title, which reminds me very much of the old school episodes. I also liked some of the performances. What I didn't like was the story, which was rather dull, and the resolution, which wasn't much of a resolution at all. It felt like two episodes crammed together and it didn't really make sense.But then we get to two of the best episodes of any series, ""The Time of Angels"" and ""Flesh and Stone"", featuring the return of the Weeping Angles and River Song. It's everything the series should be; moody, atmospheric, interesting, and featuring wonderful moments of tension, like Amy walking through a crowd of angels with her eyes closed. Fascinating viewing!After that we have another ""meh"" episode in the form of ""Vampires in Venice,"" which features vampires. In Venice. It is what it is. I didn't hate it, but it wasn't great.Then, however, we go onto ""Amy's Choice"", which was far more interesting than it should be and had an ending that reminded me strongly of certain events from ""Trial of a Timelord"".Sadly after that we go onto the two very mediocre Silurian episodes, ""The Hungry Earth"" and ""Cold Blood"". Everything about these episodes was wrong. The Silurians didn't look at all like the original ones (this is hand-waved a bit, but still), the plot is rather pointless and the ending didn't work for me at all. It was a real low-point for this series.Things pick up, however, when we get to ""Vincent and the Doctor"", which is a story more beautiful than it should be, containing some excellent performances and a genuinely moving scene at the end. For me this is the story that really MADE this series of the show. I was entirely happy!As we move into the endgame of the series we stop off at ""The Lodger"", where we see the Doctor playing football and going down the pub. It's a nice, fairly light-hearted piece, and I really liked it.Finally we get to ""The Big Bang"" and ""The Pandorica Opens"", where we get at least something of a resolution to some of the ongoing plot points with this series. River Song is back, as is... well, pretty much everyone. The Daleks, the Sontarans, the Cybermen, the Silurians... basically everyone pops by to say hello and goodbye. While the story doesn't quite reach the level it wants to, it doesn't fail from a lack of trying.Overall the series as a whole was quite good, and I'm looking very much forward to the Christmas special and the next series!

Voices get lost in the mix (on iTunes, anyway) and accents are often way too thick for my U.S. ears.  Never had this problem with Who before.  Similarly, lighting tends to shade the new Doctor's eyes under his enormous forehead, which doesn't help him to do much ""acting.""  Sidekick Karen Gillian gets one of the best introductions of all time but is frequently irritating and unlikeable.  As is the Doctor.And that, I think, is my biggest problem with the new series-- neither Amy nor the Doctor are nice people.  The two leads bounce around from place to place, getting people killed for forgettable reasons and chronically disagreeing.  More often than not, Amy will completely disregard the Doctor's orders and be right for doing so, since this Doctor is only right about 10% of the time.  There's really no believing that this sociopathic incarnation of the Doctor was once Eccleston or Tennant.  One episode has the Doctor putting a small child in danger because he forgets about him-- and not for laughs.  And since he's basically a pompous idiot this time around, one quickly begins to question why anyone would follow his lead.  Someone should at least be questioning his medical credentials, since he looks about 22 (another problem).Tonally, Series 5 seemingly aims for a slightly older crowd, with a less fantastic feel and a more frank approach to sex.  The actual result feels about as mature as a Disney sitcom, but whatever.  The stories often continue from the popular Moffat works of previous seasons (River Song, the Weeping Angels, etc) and range from pretty good to mediocre.  The best episodes I think were the season opener, ""The Lodger,"" which solved some problems by separating the two leads, and the season finale.  (None would make my top ten.)  The season seems to sacrifice week-to-week quality for the promise of a big finale payoff, but it isn't as clever as they hoped.Oddly enough, I am a huge fan of producer/ writer Steven Moffat's other show, ""Sherlock.""

1338819,AQVBOVE8P7K3J,B003EV6DBM,Condor Libros,"[2, 2]","3 1/2 stars, really. This season was bound to split viewers and cause some consternation. David Tennant was one of the most popular doctors on record (only Tom Baker rivaled him), and so I wouldn't envy anyone the task of coming after. A few of the reviews here have, I think, been a bit unfair to Matt Smith in that regard: in their (justified) adoration for Tennant, they've made up their minds to hate Smith without ever really giving him a shot.In reality, Smith acquits himself relatively well - he's stronger in some episodes than in others, but that's to be expected in his first season out when he's just figuring his own take on the role. (And in retrospect, even the fondly remembered Tennant's first season was a wee bit rocky.) Smith is always watchable, and by the time the season's two-part finale comes along he's pretty well knocking it out of the park. His doctor is less showy than Tennant's, and less melancholic or physical than Eccleston's. And yet I think Smith is able to evoke one quality essential to the Doctors character better than either of his immediate precursors: his age. Which is odd, considering that he's the youngest doctor on record. But watch him in the finale, especially his scene with the young version of Amy toward the end. Well done.That said, there is a very important weak point to this season: the writing. The premier is solid stuff, as are the series' first and third 2-parters (the Weeping Angels storyline and the finale, respectively), but the others... Meh. Something is decidedly off here.

I then tried series 5 again - I don't know why, but then I liked this series.There is a new Doctor starting in this series and a new sidekick, Amy Pond. I liked them both.The part of the first episode with Amy Pond as a little girl was very funny - fish sticks and pudding (YUCK!!). Only the Doctor would eat that I guess.I thought all the episodes were at least good, but some are really outstanding. The two-parter with the reptile people who live underground on Earth was well done and gave some food for thought as well. Another two-parter shows the return of the (quantum) Angels which had been featured in the (great) episode, Blink, from an earlier series, but this time the Angels are much, much more dangerous.I liked the Lodger episode, not so much for the story line, but more for how the Doctor interacted with his roommate. Truly funny in parts.The final two episodes were another two-parter. A Cyberman's head attacks Amy - this is really something to see. The Doctor's old enemies build the Pandorica to contain him - they claim he is the most dangerous thing in the universe. The time travel line employed does get a little hard to follow here and there, but it is still a good story.

Kilbane,"[1, 2]","Well having only discovered the glory of doctor who in January, some friends of mine spoke so highly of it that i decided what the heck I'll watch a few episodes and go from there. From The very first Episode Entitled ""Rose"" it took me only three months to Catch all the way up to current running season 6. I was obsessed! I'll be the first to admit i was extremely skeptical of how Matt Smith was going to fill David Tennant's shoes. I am happy to report that Smith has really taken the role and owned every episode of this season. He's really a much more lighthearted and carefree kind of Doctor. Which given the subject matter of Tennant's three season run of quirky first then depressed, on to almost power crazed at times, it is nice to see a less burdened doctor. don't get me wrong that is why the Tenth doctor was so good and the development of those traits is what made me keep watching.  Since we have a new Doctor it is good to see the character having more fun and back to the totally intrigued with everything wonder that makes Who continue.I was also worried about Amy Pond as a companion. I loved Rose , Martha, and Donna all for there own individual manner of how they view the Doctor. I am happy to report that Karen Gillan's Amy is unique enough to stand out from being a clone of any of the Others. Amy is no pushover she is a fiery scottish gal who had to move to England and therefore really wants to see everywhere but where she grew up. She is tough witty sometimes a little seductive as well. Her Fiance Rory is an on again off again character but i don't wanna give any spoilers lets just say it's not easy being engaged to a doctor's companion especially not for him. In short Amy is awesome as wellAnother change was Steven Moffatt taking over as head writer. Moffat wrote pretty much all of the best episodes of the previous 4 seasons. With him taking the reigns as the boss this season is incredibly intricate and interwoven with a constant story arc that at least touches every episode of the season, and practically is imperative to a few others.Almost every episode of this season is top notch i'd say the weakest of the lot is a late season one called The lodger but it has a lot of really candid doctor moments which make it a nice little break before getting slammed with the intense season finale 2-parter, which is really quite awesome.Special features are a lot of fun with the Doctor Who confidential episodes all worth watching. and the video diary's are quite fun to watch as well.

1338831,A13OUB4K10Z7F1,B003EV6DBM,Dennis Evans,"[10, 14]","I have been a Doctor Who fan since the debut of the modern series in 2005.  I have every episode of the modern series on DVD, along with 30 episodes of the 1963-1989 series.  I had great hopes for the current season, because Steven Moffat had taken over the show.  Moffat wrote 4 out of the 46 ""episodes"" (2- and 3-part episodes counting as 1) from the Russell T. Davies series.  All 4 of his earlier stories ranked among my all-time top 10, including number 1 (The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances).  Unfortunately, the first Moffat season did not come close to living up to my expectations, and I did not think that any of Moffat's episodes from this season compared favorably to his earlier 4.  I think there were 2 reasons for this.Excessive quantity led to reduced quality on Moffat's part, and he had poor support from other writers.  Moffat wrote as many episodes (4) and weekly installments (6) this year as he did in the entire Davies era - this was too much for him.  Moffat needs to cut his number of weekly installments to 4 or 5 next year and recruit better writers than he had last year.  Aside from Moffat, the only good writers in the Davies era were Paul Cornell, Robert Shearman, Toby Whithouse, and Matt Jones, in that order.  Toby Whithouse wrote 1 weekly installment this year; the other three combined for ZERO.  Moffat should bring Paul Cornell and Robert Shearman back.The second problem is Moffat's fault.  Moffat's first Doctor Who episode - The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances - was a superb example of the traditional ""Doctor solving a problem"" type of episode.  Moffat's other three episodes from the 2005-2009 series all dealt with time-loop paradoxes and/or interleaving timelines.  These episodes all worked well, especially ""Blink,"" but this was partially because such episodes were ""different.""  Having such episodes account for the bulk of a season, as they did in season 5, is tedious and also confusing.  I still don't understand how much of season 5 actually happened after the end of the last episode  (The Big Bang) erased most or all of the season.Another issue pertains to the current Doctor.  I was not impressed by the Matt Smith iteration, especially in comparison to Tom Baker, David Tennant, and Chris Eccleston. (He was definitely better than Sylvester McCoy, Colin Baker, or Jon Pertwee from the original series.)  Tennant and Eccleston brought gravity to the role.  I especially liked the angry, enigmatic, vengeful, but mostly good, version of Eccleston (Season 1 of the modern series).  The ""lonely angel"" of the Tennant years (Seasons 1-4.5) also has definite merits.  For example, the last 10 minutes of ""Human Nature/The Family of Blood"" may have been the high point of the entire modern series, or maybe even the entire series back to 1963.  The latest Season 5/Steven Moffatt/Matt Smith portrayal of the Doctor as ""a madman with a box"" lacked dignity and emotional depth, and even risked trivializing the role and making it silly.  Unlike some other somewhat negative reviewers, I did not object to Karen Gillan/Amy Pond.In terms of my average rating per episode, season 5 compares well to the first 4 full seasons, and the partial season 4.5, rating behind only season 1.  However, this is due to strength at the bottom, not strength at the top.  Season 5 had only 1 really rotten episode - Victory of the Daleks - compared to 3 or 4 per year in seasons 1-4.

Thus was the feeling when Tennant started to glow, and Matt Smith reappeared as The Doctor.  He was SUCH a departure from David Tennant's version of The Doctor, that it took a while to warm up to him in the beginning.  Tennant's Doctor loved hard, felt deeply, and burned with fire. Additionally, we lose Russel T. Davies as a writer. Russel's writing had SO much heart.  And now we introduce Stephen Moffatt - who has more of a warped sense of style...which as the seasons roll on, becomes undeniably cool and leaves you wanting more.  As for The Doctor - let's just say that Matt's version of The Doctor came on scene bumbling, clumsy, and almost slapstick comical. I immediately hated him..but I stuck with it - and Im so glad I did.SO.....As Matt was allowed to find his version of The Doctor, and we are introduced to the new companions, he literally BECOMES The Doctor.  And a New Doctor is born.The episodes in Season 5 are really good. Im not going to list them all, but you get to meet some really great characters - like Amy, Rory, River Song, Craig (one of my faces) etc...Moffatt manages to find a way to merge the heart of Davies writing filled with heart and Moffatt's own style of twists and turns taking you into the abyss.

I wouldn't call them spoilers, but those who absolutely want to remain completely unspoiled as to 1-4 may wish to avoid this review.)There is a very noticeable change in tone in the fifth series of the new Doctor Who. Some might attribute this to Matt Smith, but the blame or credit (depending upon your perspective), I suspect is more due to Steven Moffat taking over from Russell Davies as the man in charge.Lest anyone get the wrong idea, this iteration of the Doctor is still fun, but at times, I missed the passion found in series 1-4. Matt Smith is delightfully quirky as the new Doctor, but he's working with what is being written for him (and he's upstaged by Karen Gillan as Amy Pond in a number of episodes...not necessarily a bad thing, but sometimes it does feel more like ""The Amy Pond Show""). Aside from the episodes ""Vincent and the Doctor"" and the series finale (season finale, in American vernacular), it's rare to see this incarnation of the Doctor express sheer joy in the workings of the universe, humanity itself, or simple happenstance.  Personally, I found Eccleston and Tennant most engaging when at the extremes of emotion. There isn't much here that compares with Eccleston nearly breaking into tears of joy and exclaiming ""Just this once, everybody lives!""  or Tennant's farewell in his final episode (to name just two of many). That isn't to say that series 5 is devoid of emotion, but it does seem to play less a part on average.The writing too, has taken something of a hit. This was a bit of a surprise to me, as I greatly enjoyed Moffat's work (writing and/or producing) on Coupling, Sherlock, and past series of Doctor Who. It's not bad by any means, but at times it seems to lack the attention to detail we've come to expect from series 1-4. Most notably, the finale has a giant gaping plothole which is never addressed. Of course, that's not a first for Doctor Who, but at least Moffat himself (or at least he was credited with it) gave a wink and nod to the paradox he wrote himself into in ""Blink"" with the ""big ball of wibbly wobbly... time-y wimey... stuff"" line in series 3.Nonetheless, good series and recommended to fans of series 1-4.

1338847,A3LQDYVAAHHV2T,B003EV6DBM,FYI,"[14, 21]","Steven Moffat turned Doctor Who into the Amy Pond Show, or an ersatz ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer."" He uses Doctor Who to make ""his mark"" rather than respect the genre and characters. At its best, this British pop-culture phenomena reflects deeper values, legends, and myths. Moffat's anti-continuity regeneration reinvents the wheel and the Doctor. Doctor Who's heroic intensity is squandered, mired by women with rotten attitudes. Big explosions and fluff don't equal real imagination, Mr. Moffat. Like disco-era John Nathan-Turner, ego runs amuck; even the opening score is ruined. Matt Smith and Karen Gillan lack the maturity or charisma to reach beyond these limitations. Viewers are subjected to poor dialog delivered in loud, rapid-fire staccato mumbles; this does not make bad stories more interesting. The fellow with the thankless task of playing Pond's Rory would be a better Doctor, given half a chance.Moffat's Doctor is a vehicle for his own perpetually adolescent framework, rife with obnoxious women reflecting childish (in a bad way) fantasies. Russell T. Davies left and the show turned girly. The Doctor is saddled with a sullen sulking boring sidekick, Amy Pond, a neurotic nightmare. In Moffat's ""The Time of Angels/Flesh and Stone,"" she utters the loathsome, ""Are we there yet?"" The vapid Pond is permeated with Botox flat-affect, an un-enticing creature only a peculiar (in a bad way) old man would find attractive, dolled-up in silly skirts and cowboy boots. Her boyfriend Rory is a pathetic joke (no fault of the actor). As a child, Pond kneeled at her bedside praying to Santa Claus, but as a petulant adult she ridiculously throws herself on that bed demanding the Doctor's services. Is this for children? Or demented old men? Pond is no Donna Noble, no Rose, no Martha Jones, no Sarah Jane Smith, no Zoe. ""Hello, Sweetie."" Translation: ""Hi, you dumb ...""Sandwiched between women telling him how dumb he is, the Doctor can't summon Tennant's energy and intensity. Moffat's vat of blandness flattens the Time Lord's cosmos, grandness and majesty are missing. The young actress Caitlin Blackwood, as the child Pond, does a great job. Alex Kingston's character is the only semi-strong one, thus she dominates her scenes, something not possible in previous seasons. Writers like Chris Chibnall and Richard Curtis (Tony Curran steals the show as Vincent) provide much better episodes than Moffat's. The only reason Moffat's previous ""Blink"" was good is that Davies rewrote the script with help from other talents. The season's great story was written by Gareth Roberts, ""The Lodger."" Roberts created a classic of British Sci-Fi, perfection. ""The Lodger"" features a rescue by teapot: Doctor Who pouring medicine down the throat of his kindly plump roommate. Later, he converses with a very attractive cat on the mysterious stairwell. James Corden is a delight as ""Craig,"" while Matt Smith does his best in this story, frenetic and eccentric (of course). The Doctor bangs his head on the above roommate, communicating images of past Doctor Who incarnations; this is Gareth Robert's invitation to inspire your investigation into the vast old series.I enjoy the TARDIS by exploring venerable episodes of the past, and we're talking decades. Not all Doctors were created equal. In the 1980s, producers lost their minds and respect for Who fans, as they have now. The unique music was badly altered from Grainer's original score, and costumes lacked the 1960/70s thrift-store flair of the original. Peter Davison and Colin Baker were aberrant versions; Davison walked through the part like a Plastic Man. Sylvester McCoy tries, though fans pity the capable actor forced to run around in ""Delta and the Bannerman"" like a fool. Thankfully, Russell T. Davies and his Doctor Who restored the intelligent alien with the eccentric grace of Hartnell, Troughton, Pertwee, and Tom Baker. You may want to try an episode that influenced Davies:Doctor Who: Spearhead from Space (Story 51). This campy romp stars the great Jon Pertwee, whose portrayal of the super-intelligent elegant cosmic eccentric flavours Tennant's Doctor.I have to get Amy Pond's brittle whining out of my head with heroic Hartnell and Pertwee classics. The kid'sThe Sarah Jane Adventures: The Complete Second Seasonfeatures the incredible good-sport and fine actress Elisabeth Sladen, elegant as Sarah Jane, better than anyone on the New Who, with her crew of smart children, especially the talented actor who portrays her son Luke. The disappointingThe Sarah Jane Adventures: The Complete Third Seasoninflicts Sladen with orange glop. But it features a story written by Gareth Roberts, containing Tennant's last appearance, ""The Wedding of Sarah Jane Smith."" Before allowing Sarah Jane's young companions into the TARDIS, Tennant deftly evokes Hartnell with one precise phrase and motion.Notes on Season Six, Doctor Boo-Who, or The Amy Pond Show:Again, I'm trying not to blame the actors; it's not their fault that Moffat blandly flattens the Time Lord's cosmos; grandness and majesty are MIA. Even the distinctive English landscape is ditched in favor of the surreal. Under Russell T. Davies, the U.K. itself was a complex character of the series. But Moffat's bloated budget and silly concept of American fans turns Doctor Who into an incoherent version of the X-Files. Fans delight in the Doctor's Britishness, and don't want pandering. No one cares about watching a bad American president portrayed preposterously. But hey, Moffat couldn't even get Churchill right. Without substantive stories, all rules are off. The over-rated Neil Gaiman's fantasy nightmares don't even try to make sense; pointless punches are pulled on shallow cartoon characters. The immature Doctor can't shine, stuck with griping harpies. Boo-hoo, Pond leaks. Who cares? Pond's loathsome, ""Are we there yet?"" of Season Five set the tone for Season Six. Moffat offers no Steam Punk, but an overheated radiator.Straining to broaden the market, Moffat's opening sequence focuses the narrative on Little Miss Moffat, i.e., Amy Pond. Strong women aren't whiners, as anyone blessed to explore the cosmos with one knows. Again, dolled-up in silly skirts and cowboy boots, Pond is no Action Girl. Alex Kingston's character again dominates her scenes. Again, Pond's poor husband Rory is a pathetic joke (no fault of the excellent actor). Doctor Who is merely a creature dominated by obnoxious women with rotten attitudes. In Season Six, ""Day of the Moon,"" a quivering Amy Pond inflicts us with: ""It's a figure of speech, moron!"" and ""Hey, stupid face!"" Or we again get River Song's unbelievable ""Hello Sweetie,"" you dumb ...Moffat and the over-rated Gaiman indulge in fantasy, envisioning Doctor Who as a freak-show. The Disneyish pirate episode ""The Curse of the Black Spot"" explores Moffat's parenting issues. It adds nothing to the Who Oeuvre. Gaiman's comic-book shtick is in full Victorian Drag during ""The Doctor's Wife,"" with his usual Alice in Wonderland gimmicks. The Doctor further regresses into an inept anti-hero: a stuttering, self-conscious, doddering young man floundering in piles of Gaiman's sloppy Victorian junk. It's cut and paste imagery, sampling, not creativity, and tedious running in corridors. This emotional, sentimental manipulation attempts to involve us, but it's not coherent Sci-Fi. The Doctor is already psychically sensitive to the TARDIS, but in Gaiman's fantasy play-world, the TARDIS is reduced to human form. She blurts, ""What am I saying? Why am I saying it?"" Who cares? Gaiman reduces the original TARIS to vacuous stupidity, with her overweening need to be called ""Sexy."" Yeah, right. The extraordinary TARDIS done up in a frock and simpering is boring, sexist, not sexy. Only one point, that the TARDIS stole the Doctor, and not the other way around, is interesting. ""The Rebel Flesh"" is better Sci-Fi, at least the noxious Pond is quieter, and poor Rory is given more to chew on.Fans wish the superbly talented Doctor Who writer Gareth Roberts, who added historic depth and polished humor to the Doctor, could rescue the series. Meanwhile, Doctor Who has left the building, and even the TARDIS is too clean.A shout-out ""Amen Brother!"" to reviewer Robert Hindla of The Real Who-ville.",2,Doctor Shrew,1289260800,"11 9,

I liked the first episode, but grew to increasingly dislike the new team as I watched more episodes. I have now reached the point where I loathe Smith.In a way, I can't exactly blame him because Smith is too young to be Doctor Who. Maybe it's his limitation as an actor, but 27-year-old Matt Smith portrays Doctor Who as a 27-year-old or even younger. His Doctor Who lacks wisdom (that can only come from age and experience), passion and brilliance of intellect (which Tennant had in loads), and the sadness of being the last of his species and of having seen so much suffering and misery.Instead, Smith's Doctor Who is physically gawky (like some bumbling teenager), not particularly brilliant (how many times did Amy, a 20-year-old earthling with neither education nor special training, come up with the solution to their predicament? Puleese), and most offensive of all, is rude (telling others to ""Shut Up!) and RESORTS TO VIOLENCE (which violates Doctor Who's very nature).I'm also weary of how Moffat and the writers make every episode incomplete -- they continue on and bleed into each other. No episode is truly a stand-alone episode.If Smith and Moffat continue what they've done in this season, I will no longer watch Doctor Who.

1338851,A26TY6GCGBF5HT,B003EV6DBM,Graves,"[6, 9]","The fifth season of the BBC's wildly popular sci-fi program Doctor Who, about a time travelling alien with a fondness for earth, see's new comer Matt Smith step somewhat shakily into the shoes of the departing David Tennant. There were a few bumps along the way but by the end, long time fans of the show can rest easy in the konwledge that the character of the Doctor is in capable hands.It is always a risk when you change the lead character in a series, even one like Doctor Who which has the `regeneration' as a well established part of the character, but when the very popular David Tennant stepped down from the role after 3 seasons, 4 specials and a few cameos on other shows, he left some very big shoes to fill.  At 25 Matt Smith, the 11th actor to take the role, was also the youngest actor ever to play the 900+ year old Time Lord and there was a considerable amount of concern over his ability to pull it off. Added to this was the fact the long time producer had also stepped down meaning there wasn't the same guiding hand to help Smith find his way.The result is that at the beginning of the series Smith seems a little unsure of himself. A new actor has to be given time to grow into the role and set his own stamp on it. In this Smith wasn't helped by the writing. A lot of the dialogue he's given early on can easily be imagined coming from Tennant's mouth. Sure it help's the audience's continuity but makes it harder for the actor to make the role his own. As the series progressed though Smith's style starts to evolve;  a fondness for improvising odd devices and a hint of snobbery. He seems far more comfortable in his skin than Tennant's somewhat gangly portrayal and this projects an easy confidence. He does come across as a bit grumpy at times like the distracted not quite mad scientist and while Tennant's Doctor loved local slang, Smith seems to be working his own, slightly off dialogue that is certainly more memorable. ""Am I talking nonsense? No I'm talking perfect sense. You're just not keeping up!""The adventures themselves are the usual mix of the Doctor's adventures with a slightly larger proportion seemly set in the modern world rather than the past or future. (Sorry but one set only 10 years in the future doesn't count as `future.)Adventures include helping Winston Churchill during the blitz, meeting a lonely Van Gogh , discovering the mystery behind the ""spaceship UK"" in the far future, facing another classic enemy of the doctor's from the original series in the 1960's, in modern Essex something is living upstairs from a love lorn slacker  and something is hiding in renaissance Venice so terrible it would prefer the populace thinks it's a blood sucking vampire than the truth.The Doctor's companion, Amy Pond, a strong willed Scottish girl on the run from her wedding day is a nice fit after several seasons of girls simpering after the Doctor. One problem though is she has a fondness for very short skirts.  The actress has the legs for it, but they seem a little out of place in, for example 1940 London, but no mention of this is made.Not all of the adventures work. The two part adventure with the weeping angels was so awful that it has caused some people to rethink their fondness for their first appearance in Tennant's second season, Blink. And one where the doctor is caught up between wondering if he's in a dream or not was just odd. The interestring thing is that these adventures on disc are longer than what was broadcast on BBC America, where I assume the original productions were' edited for television' or at least commercials. The result is that these adventures seem less rushed and what had seemed like continuity errors to the sharp eyed viewer are actually explained.For the most part this is entertaining. The show was feeling its way having changed its producer and lead actor at the same time. It is a little shaky in parts but it also very much is Doctor Who.  After early, shaky steps Smith proves he is in fact the Doctor with a charm and wit that should entertain for a long time to come.",4,A shaky start but still a fun Doctor.,1280448000,"07 30, 2010",2010,4072,"['fifth', 'season', 'BBC', 'wildly', 'popular', 'sci-fi', 'program', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'time', 'travelling', 'alien', 'fondness', 'earth', 'see', 'new', 'comer', 'Matt', 'Smith', 'step', 'somewhat', 'shakily', 'shoes', 'departing', 'David', 'Tennant', 'were', 'few', 'bumps', 'way', 'end', 'long', 'time', 'fans', 'show', 'can', 'rest', 'easy', 'konwledge', 'character', 'Doctor', 'capable', 'hands.It', 'always', 'risk', 'when', 'change', 'lead', 'character', 'series', 'even', 'one', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'regeneration', 'well', 'established', 'part', 'character', 'when', 'very', 'popular', 'David', 'Tennant', 'stepped', 'down', 'role', '3', 'seasons', '4', 'specials', 'few', 'cameos', 'other', 'shows', 'left', 'very', 'big', 'shoes', 'fill', '25', 'Matt', 'Smith', '11th', 'actor', 'take', 'role', 'was', 'also', 'youngest', 'actor', 'ever', 'play', '900+', 'year', 'old', 'Time', 'Lord', 'was', 'considerable', 'amount', 'concern', 'ability', 'pull', 'off', 'Added', 'was', 'fact', 'long', 'time', 'producer', 'had', 'also', 'stepped', 'down', 'meaning', 'there', 'was', ""n't"", 'same', 'guiding', 'hand', 'help', 'Smith', 'find', 'way.The', 'result', 'beginning', 'series', 'Smith', 'little', 'unsure', 'new', 'actor', 'be', 'given', 'time', 'grow', 'role', 'set', 'own', 'stamp', 'Smith', 'was', ""n't"", 'helped', 'writing', 'lot', 'dialogue', 'given', 'early', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'imagined', 'coming', 'Tennant', 'mouth', 'Sure', 'help', 'audience', 'continuity', 'harder', 'actor', 'make', 'role', 'own', 'series', 'progressed', 'Smith', 'style', 'evolve', 'fondness', 'improvising', 'odd', 'devices', 'hint', 'snobbery', 'far', 'more', 'comfortable', 'skin', 'Tennant', 'somewhat', 'gangly', 'portrayal', 'projects', 'easy', 'confidence', 'come', 'bit', 'grumpy', 'times', 'distracted', 'not', 'quite', 'mad', 'scientist', 'Tennant', 'Doctor', 'loved', 'local', 'slang', 'Smith', 'be', 'working', 'own', 'slightly', 'dialogue', 'certainly', 'more', 'memorable', 'Am', 'talking', 'nonsense', 'No', ""'m"", 'talking', 'perfect', 'sense', ""'re"", 'just', 'not', 'keeping', 'up', 'adventures', 'are', 'usual', 'mix', 'Doctor', 'adventures', 'slightly', 'larger', 'proportion', 'seemly', 'set', 'modern', 'world', 'rather', 'past', 'future', 'Sorry', 'one', 'set', 'only', '10', 'years', 'future', ""n't"", 'count', 'future', 'include', 'helping', 'Winston', 'Churchill', 'blitz', 'meeting', 'lonely', 'Van', 'Gogh', 'discovering', 'mystery', 'spaceship', 'UK', 'far', 'future', 'facing', 'classic', 'enemy', 'doctor', 'original', 'series', '1960', 'modern', 'Essex', 'something', 'living', 'upstairs', 'love', 'lorn', 'slacker', 'something', 'hiding', 'renaissance', 'Venice', 'so', 'terrible', 'would', 'prefer', 'populace', 'blood', 'sucking', 'vampire', 'truth.The', 'Doctor', 'companion', 'Amy', 'Pond', 'strong', 'willed', 'Scottish', 'girl', 'run', 'wedding', 'day', 'nice', 'fit', 'several', 'seasons', 'girls', 'simpering', 'Doctor', 'One', 'problem', 'though', 'fondness', 'very', 'short', 'skirts', 'actress', 'legs', 'seem', 'little', 'place', 'example', '1940', 'London', 'mention', 'made.Not', 'adventures', 'work', 'two', 'part', 'adventure', 'weeping', 'angels', 'was', 'so', 'awful', 'caused', 'people', 'rethink', 'fondness', 'first', 'appearance', 'Tennant', 'second', 'season', 'Blink', 'one', 'where', 'doctor', 'caught', 'up', 'wondering', 'dream', 'not', 'was', 'just', 'odd', 'interestring', 'thing', 'adventures', 'disc', 'are', 'longer', 'what', 'was', 'broadcast', 'BBC', 'America', 'where', 'assume', 'original', 'productions', 'were', 'edited', 'television', 'least', 'commercials', 'result', 'adventures', 'seem', 'less', 'rushed', 'what', 'had', 'seemed', 'continuity', 'errors', 'sharp', 'eyed', 'viewer', 'are', 'actually', 'explained.For', 'most', 'part', 'entertaining', 'show', 'was', 'feeling', 'way', 'having', 'changed', 'producer', 'lead', 'actor', 'same', 'time', 'little', 'shaky', 'parts', 'also', 'very', 'much', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'early', 'shaky', 'steps', 'Smith', 'fact', 'Doctor', 'charm', 'wit', 'should', 'entertain', 'long', 'time', 'come']",N/A

1338856,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B003EV6DBM,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[7, 12]","As the fairly wonderful David Tennant moves on to do whatever, Matt Smith steps thru the door as the new and the eleventh and the youngest Doctor yet. And while I count Tom Baker as my most favorite Doctor ever, this new guy rapidly wins me over. This latest incarnation of the Doctor - youthful-faced (for someone 907 years old) and leany-gawky and so floppy-haired that Conan O'Brien isn't amused - is a bit high strung and yet has that twinkle in the eye. The eccentricity is a given, as is that he still champions the human race. And the Doctor is clearly having fun, welcomes each dawning adventure with open arms, he does. It helps that his new companion - the rather fantastic Amy Pond (a superb Karen Gillan) - is as equally excited. I am loving the new blood. And this Doctor coins the best nickname for himself yet: ""space Gandalf.""This season tells the life of Amelia Pond. The first episode, ""The Eleventh Hour,"" sold me on the new Doctor, had me relishing the fairy tale angle. There's an almost mythic archetypal element to the Doctor and Amy Pond's relationship. It dates back to how they met. ""The Eleventh Hour"" opens one evening with an earnest Scottish seven-year-old named Amelia Pond praying for someone to come and fix the scary crack in her bedroom wall. And when the disoriented new Doctor appears from nowhere to hang out and taste various foods (fish custard?) and to examine that notorious wall crack, little Amelia Pond understandably takes to him. So much so, that many years later the Doctor still has a place in the adult Amelia's mind (Amelia who is now Amy). Twelve years after the Doctor first met Amelia, he resurfaces, very tardy on his promise. He resurfaces in the bare nick of time. Because while he'd been gone, something sinister had stayed with Amy Pond all these years. Just what is the secret of... Prisoner Zero?A few things to take from this episode. One is the chemistry between Matt Smith and Karen Gillan (both of them are irrepressible). Then, near the end, the Doctor has a moment of sheer asssownery as he absolutely cows an encroaching alien spacecraft (""Hello, I'm the Doctor. Basically... run.""). Finally, we hear Prisoner Zero's ominous prophecy and realize it to be this season's recurring plot thread: ""The universe is cracked. The Pandorica will open. Silence will fall."" That crack is growing ever wider. Oh, snap.A new interior set design for the Tardis. A new retro wardrobe for the new Doctor (bow ties are cool again). A new companion. But the tropes are familiar. The time travel. The alien planets. The Daleks. The last surviving Time Lord applying his smug and his compassion and intellect to save the day. And so on, so on. This season allows us to gaze at weeping angels and vampires in Venice and at the very last of the star whales. We take in an insidious dream lord and a faithful lone plastic Roman Centurion, and let's not forget the attack of the evil geriatrics. And Starship UK. We even see the Doctor brush elbows with Winston Churchill and Vincent Van Gogh. All thirteen episodes are fine and I love the many bits of continuity callbacks, but I've got preferences. ""The Eleventh Hour"" is fantastic for the reasons already mentioned. ""The Time of Angels"" is creepy, creepy, creeeeepy. The riveting two-part season-ender (""The Pandorica Opens"" & ""The Big Bang"") has the Doctor racing against time to solve the puzzle of that crack in the wall which could spell doom for all time and all the stars in the sky. And there's also a wedding and crazy dancing at the wedding. And possibly Karen Gillan's finest moment in this show so far.Oh, and we finally learn why the Tardis makes that noise whenever it begins fading in and out.DOCTOR WHO - THE COMPLETE FIFTH SERIES contains the entire thirteen episodes. It comes in six discs and with the following bonus features:- ""Meanwhile in the Tardis"" presents two additional scenes (from ""The Eleventh Hour"" & ""Flesh and Stone,"" respectively) with Amy and the Doctor hanging out in the Tardis- ""Monster Files"" on the Daleks, the Weeping Angels, the Silurians, and the Alliance- A 3-Part ""Video Diary"" (split over three discs) as Matt Smith and Karen Gillan guide you behind-the-scenes of the show from make-up to sets to the actors' trailers to crafts services to shooting various scenes of the show- The thirteen informative ""Doctor Who Confidential"" mini-documentaries (each @13-15 minutes long) which explore the episodes in Series 5- ""In-Vision Commentaries"" have various of the cast & crew (but not Matt Smith) in picture-in-picture mode as they provide commentary tracks for the following six episodes: ""The Eleventh Hour,"" ""Victory of the Daleks,"" ""The Time of Angels"" (in which Karen Gillan and head writer Steven Moffat settle the debate of who would win in a battle between the Daleks and the Weeping Angels), ""The Vampires of Venice,"" ""Cold Blood,"" and ""The Big Bang"" (also with Karen Gillan)- Outtakes- Teaser trailers, episodic trailers, finale trailers, international trailers... in a nutshell, trailers, trailers, trailers- The DVD box set also comes with three lithographs featuring, respectively, an orange Dalek, the Tardis, and Amy & the Doctor, as well as a tiny pamphlet promoting various cool Doctor Who toysThe Series 5 episodes:- ""The Eleventh Hour"" - Imagine if you learn that your imaginary childhood friend was real? Kiss-a-gram girl Amy Pond, haunted by a perceived delusion, must confront a monster long ago escaped from a crack in her bedroom wall and that had been lurking in her home all these years.- ""The Beast Below"" - Hundreds of years in the future, the United Kingdom of Britain is floating about in space - the Starship UK, if you will - but something nasty inhabits the ship's lower levels. It never bodes well when a little girl sings a nursery song or says a scary poem. ""Expect no love from the Beast Below,"" this little girl recites.- ""Victory of the Daleks"" - In wartime England, Prime Minister Winston Churchill has a new secret weapon in his fight against Germany: the Daleks. ""I am your soldier,"" harshly proclaims one of Churchill's Ironsides to the Doctor who isn't buying any of it. It's weird, though, to hear a Dalek volunteering to make tea.- ""The Time of Angels"" & ""Flesh and Stone"" - In an adventure 12,000 years in the making, the Doctor, Amy Pond, and the mysterious Professor River Song (Alex Kingston) tangle with an ""enemy of unnoble power and infinite evil."" A monster who can't move as long as you look at it, one wouldn't think of that as so frightening. Except that one has to blink sometime. And that's when they get you. One of the spookiest, creepy-crawliest Doctor Who episodes I've ever seen.- ""The Vampires of Venice"" - In the year 1580, in Venice, the sinister and undead Signora Caldieri reigns supreme. This is the when and where that the Doctor sends Amy and her fiance Rory off to on their romantic date. It's funny how the Doctor and Amy get so excited when they first learn they may be facing vampires.- ""Amy's Choice"" - Five years later, the Doctor drops in on Rory and a pregnant Amy in their quaint little village. In the present, they're all still in the Tardis but traveling towards a cold dead sun. Which is the dream, which is the reality?- ""The Hungry Earth"" & ""Cold Blood"" - Not to steal from the First in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but the theme for this one is ""From beneath you, it devours."" Enroute to Rio, the Doctor, Amy, and Rory make an unscheduled pit stop in 2020AD, in the mining community of Cwmtaff, South Wales, which at that moment is a pretty untouristy place. The miners of Cwmtaff are terrorized by something burrowing in the ground. Because while the miners have been drilling down, something else has been drilling up.- ""Vincent and the Doctor"" - At an art museum, the Doctor espies evil lurking in a Vincent Van Gogh painting. So it's time travel time back to 1890, France, to consult with the famous moody madman who, it turns out, can see invisible monsters. We also learn that Van Gogh loathes sunflowers. Bill Nighy has a cameo.- ""The Lodger"" - Perilous time loops collide with unrequited love. Craig Owens, the landlord, is a bit concerned about that wee bit of rotting stain on the ceiling and also about that mysterious lodger upstairs and sundry associated odd noises. And then the Doctor shows up as the new flat mate. The Doctor also plays football (soccer, to the Yanks).- ""The Pandorica Opens"" & ""The Big Bang"" - The apocalyptic ""crack in the wall"" arc comes to a head, triggered by Vincent Van Gogh's prophetic painting. The Underhenge, the Alliance and its fleet of ten thousand (at least) war ships orbiting Earth, the Pandorica exhibit, the slaying of stars, Go go gadget hand, a fez, and even more than usual of mucking about with the time continuum. Two bloody brilliant episodes.",5,"""I'm the Doctor.

Yet I got hooked on this new series as I'd step through the room where my father watches the show. Now, I've never seen the original series, and the only thing that is an ""old version"" that I've seen is the movie fox did, and I liked that too.This series is fresh mostly because its a fantasy adventure that doesn't take itself seriously. Writers have the stories and characters poke fun at the absurdity of the sci fi universe and that is what makes it so fun. The stories are stupid, but the style of delivery is comical and the actors/actress are humorous which makes the show so entertaining. It feels fresh because if you compare it to the style of shows which dominate US airwaves, (CSI, Law & Order, NCIS, Cold Case, Bones) all these murder shows that are soooo repetitive and predictable, Doctor Who feels so original.It is a stupid show, but everyone involved knows it and uses that to their advantage of creating an entertaining fantasy world of far fetched crisis with humorous characters.Series 5 is not as good as 3 or 4 due to Amy Pond who is very dependent on The Doctor. I like companions like Martha Jones and Donna because they are able to competently handle themselves in dire situations, and when they're left without The Doctor, those companions knew what to do. Amy Pond is very much like Rose frm series 1 and 2, Pond is funny but such a drag because she can't really do anything without The Doctor telling her what to do.Matt Smith is brilliant and a perfect replacement for Tenet, and I look forward to Smith to remain as The Doctor for as long as possible. Now the finale for this series is not as good as the past 4 were because the end event is not as dangerous for the world, but its still captivating. The best aspects to this series was the pilot and seeing the new Doctor for the first time in action and witnessing him regenerate with a very intriguing personality. The return of the Weeping Angels along with Riverssong was great, and the writers seem to be hinting a stronger arc w/ her in it. I personally am keeping my fingers crossed for Riversong to be The Doctor's next companion, she's competent, witty, smart, and keeps The Doctor in line, the perfect woman.Love this series and Matt Smith is a godsend as the new Doctor.",4,"New Doctor, New Rules.",1280102400,"07 26, 2010",2010,2335,"['Love', 'coming', 'early', '20', 'yr', 'old', 'who', ""n't"", 'sci', 'fi', 'got', 'hooked', 'new', 'series', ""'d"", 'step', 'room', 'where', 'father', 'show', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'original', 'series', 'only', 'thing', 'old', 'version', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'fox', 'did', 'liked', 'too.This', 'series', 'fresh', 'mostly', 'fantasy', 'adventure', ""n't"", 'take', 'seriously', 'Writers', 'have', 'stories', 'characters', 'poke', 'fun', 'absurdity', 'sci', 'fi', 'universe', 'what', 'so', 'fun', 'stories', 'are', 'stupid', 'style', 'delivery', 'comical', 'actors/actress', 'are', 'humorous', 'show', 'so', 'entertaining', 'fresh', 'compare', 'style', 'shows', 'dominate', 'US', 'airwaves', 'CSI', 'Law', 'Order', 'NCIS', 'Cold', 'Case', 'Bones', 'murder', 'shows', 'are', 'soooo', 'repetitive', 'predictable', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'so', 'original.It', 'stupid', 'show', 'everyone', 'involved', 'advantage', 'creating', 'entertaining', 'fantasy', 'world', 'far', 'fetched', 'crisis', 'humorous', 'characters.Series', '5', 'not', 'as', 'good', '3', '4', 'due', 'Amy', 'Pond', 'who', 'very', 'dependent', 'Doctor', 'like', 'companions', 'Martha', 'Jones', 'Donna', 'are', 'able', 'competently', 'handle', 'dire', 'situations', 'when', ""'re"", 'left', 'Doctor', 'companions', 'knew', 'what', 'do', 'Amy', 'Pond', 'very', 'much', 'Rose', 'frm', 'series', '1', '2', 'Pond', 'funny', 'such', 'drag', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'anything', 'Doctor', 'telling', 'what', 'do.Matt', 'Smith', 'brilliant', 'perfect', 'replacement', 'Tenet', 'look', 'forward', 'Smith', 'remain', 'Doctor', 'as', 'long', 'possible', 'Now', 'finale', 'series', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'past', '4', 'were', 'end', 'event', 'not', 'as', 'dangerous', 'world', 'still', 'captivating', 'best', 'aspects', 'series', 'was', 'pilot', 'seeing', 'new', 'Doctor', 'first', 'time', 'action', 'witnessing', 'regenerate', 'very', 'intriguing', 'personality', 'return', 'Weeping', 'Angels', 'Riverssong', 'was', 'great', 'writers', 'seem', 'be', 'hinting', 'stronger', 'arc', 'w/', 'personally', 'am', 'keeping', 'fingers', 'crossed', 'Riversong', 'be', 'Doctor', 'next', 'companion', 'competent', 'witty', 'smart', 'Doctor', 'line', 'perfect', 'woman.Love', 'series', 'Matt', 'Smith', 'godsend', 'new', 'Doctor']",N/A

1338872,A1ZR8F86DJRVLX,B003EV6DBM,Jason Bean,"[9, 14]","I've been a fan of Doctor Who since 2005 when Christopher Eccleston took the title role. After that first season I didn't think anyone else could top him but of course David Tennant came along and made the character iconic from the get go. After three seasons and some so-so films I was ready to stop watching the show because I didn't think anyone could top David Tennant, nor did I want them to. Imagine my surprise when I watched the first episode of Dr. Who season 5 and was rooting for Matt Smith from the get go!Doctor Who season 5 sets itself apart from the first four seasons by creating a completely new plot. There's a crack running through all of time and space that's erasing all of existence. The Doctor meets new companion Amy Pond who's connected to this rift somehow and it keeps popping up wherever they go. The episodes seem like standard Dr. Who fare (somethings wrong in some part of space/time, they investigate, nothing's as it seems, Doctor pulls some idea out of no-where nd saves the day with a speech in the end). That is until a few episodes in and we get the two-parter 'Time of Angels'/'Flesh in Stone'. These two episodes bring a level of suspense rarely seen in television and make up for the more formula episodes in the season (though the finale, which is also a two-parter manages to tie in the more mundane episodes into the overall plot). To put it simply, the story of this season is not to be missed!As I said before I was hesitant about Matt Smith as the Doctor. The promo-shots with him in the bow-tie made me want to gag and his youthful appearance made me afraid he was going to ruin a good mature character. Of course I was wrong; Smith's Doctor is more naive but he's got a charm that's completely his own and I'll admit he's my favorite incarnation of he Doctor to date, bow-tie and all! Just as good (or maybe better) is actress Karen Gillan as companion Amy Pond. While Amy's very taken with the Doctor at first she's not afraid to talk back to him and throw his self-righteousness back in his face! Their relationship in the season is really something to see!While this season of Doctor Who is very different than previous series, it's no less impressive (and in my opinion MORE impressive).

1338875,A1UEW0GN2JOK5B,B003EV6DBM,Jes,"[2, 2]","I am not a Doctor Who fan, in general.  I have been aware of the series for years, and have a great deal of respect for it as the longest running series ever.  That is also why I tend not to like it, overall.  When you develop a mechanic that allows you to replace the cast every few years or so, yes the series lives on, but you have new people.  What if the new people don't click?  What if the newest doctor doesn't grab your attention?  New companions' dynamic are not believable?That has been my trouble for the longest time.  I knew of the series, had a grasp of the various races and plots, but... I never clicked with actors.  So, I couldn't get into it.  And then, they stumbled upon Matt Smith and I finally found a doctor I could grasp, one that actually grabbed my attention.  More than that, his companions didn't bother me.  The Ponds worked, River Song made sense, even the cameo companions (like Roy's Dad) played out well.When they change up the cast, I catch a few episodes (recently through means like Netflix), to give it a chance.  If they cannot grab me in 3 episodes, they never will.  Matt Smith and his gang hit the mark and, after the 3rd episode, I instantly ordered all the series that portrayed him as the Doctor (as well as ordered the &#34;day of the doctor&#34; special out in Dec).  They did THAT well.  Never owned any Doctor Who before, but it landed so well, I went all out.That is what I recommend to people that do not know, or are curious about, Doctor Who.  Find a few episodes, on Youtube, Netflix, or whatever.  Each new Doctor is a different taste.  See if any of the land with you.  There are 11 (soon to be 12) different doctors and all are a hit or miss, if you ask me.You might find one you enjoy, or love them all.  But, give it a shot.

Fortunately it was also the time of vhs so I managed to record a plethora of episodes going back to Jon Pertwee.Everyone will tell you they have a favorite Doctor. For many it was the quirkiness and smile of Tom Baker that first sold them. For others the suave sophistication of Pertwee. For me it was Peter Davidson for the very simple reason that, for the first time, the Doctor was no longer a character, he was a person. A bit stuffy perhaps, but a reasonably ordinary being with the same sorts of reactions as us humans to various situations. He was a the kind of guy you could really see yourself hanging around with and not always feeling a bit out of place.When Doctor Who was revived by the BBC with Christopher Eccleston in the title role, I was initially dubious. He was too brooding, too angry, and his attempts at humor came off a bit sinister. Not my ideal traveling companion. But then David Tennant assumed the role and at last the Doctor was fulfilled. Possessing all the sense of fun of a Tom Baker, but with the ability to be a deliberate goof of Patrick Troughton. Yet in an instant he could become quietly menacing. And his rages (and their results) were frightening. In short, for me he WAS the Doctor, the regeneration it had all been leading up to.Naturally, learning that David would depart after only four years raised a concern for me. There was even talk that the show itself could be cancelled. How could the top David?Well, they didn't. They did something better and something earlier teams of Doctor Who producers and writers had known since William Hartnell announced he was leaving the first incarnation of the Doctor. They went sideways. And with delightful effect.Matt Smith has qualities that wouldn't sit well in David's Doctor, but which suit the new direction of the show to a tee. He is, by turns, absent-mindedly brilliant, goofy, geeky, thoughtful, charming and, ultimately, unique. Just like all prior Doctors have been. And it works. Again.In addition, the transition to the helm being manned by Peter Moffett is producing many of the most intricate, thoughtful and engaging stories. The high standard set by such earlier incarnation episodes as the brilliant ""Blink"" (Season 3) is being nicely maintained. It's even being played with, as demonstrated by the Doctors use of the Matter Transfer wrist devide in the final episode of this latest season.All in all, the Doctor and his latest, perhaps most charming Companions (Rory and Amy) promise some exciting heights to be reached in Matt's second season (provided he never ever dons a Fez again. That was just so wrong. Really.) For this first season we are treated to a fantasic episodic science fiction series merely shifting gears and making a sharp turn, tires squealing the whole way. And anyone who enjoys sci-fi, wit, excitement and thought-provoking concepts could do much worse that this latest season.",5,The torch has been passed,1289001600,"11 6, 2010",2010,3004,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'fan', 'thirty', 'years', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'only', 'occasionally', 'available', 'PBS', 'Fortunately', 'was', 'also', 'time', 'vhs', 'managed', 'record', 'plethora', 'episodes', 'going', 'back', 'Jon', 'Pertwee.Everyone', 'will', 'tell', 'have', 'favorite', 'Doctor', 'many', 'was', 'quirkiness', 'smile', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'first', 'sold', 'others', 'suave', 'sophistication', 'Pertwee', 'was', 'Peter', 'Davidson', 'very', 'simple', 'reason', 'first', 'time', 'Doctor', 'was', 'no', 'longer', 'character', 'was', 'person', 'bit', 'stuffy', 'perhaps', 'reasonably', 'ordinary', 'being', 'same', 'sorts', 'reactions', 'humans', 'various', 'situations', 'was', 'kind', 'guy', 'could', 'really', 'see', 'hanging', 'not', 'always', 'feeling', 'bit', 'place.When', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'was', 'revived', 'BBC', 'Christopher', 'Eccleston', 'title', 'role', 'was', 'initially', 'dubious', 'was', 'too', 'brooding', 'too', 'angry', 'attempts', 'humor', 'came', 'off', 'bit', 'sinister', 'Not', 'ideal', 'traveling', 'companion', 'then', 'David', 'Tennant', 'assumed', 'role', 'last', 'Doctor', 'was', 'fulfilled', 'Possessing', 'sense', 'fun', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'ability', 'be', 'deliberate', 'goof', 'Patrick', 'Troughton', 'instant', 'could', 'become', 'quietly', 'menacing', 'rages', 'results', 'were', 'frightening', 'short', 'WAS', 'Doctor', 'regeneration', 'had', 'been', 'leading', 'up', 'to.Naturally', 'learning', 'David', 'would', 'depart', 'only', 'four', 'years', 'raised', 'concern', 'was', 'even', 'talk', 'show', 'could', 'be', 'cancelled', 'How', 'could', 'top', 'David', 'Well', 'did', ""n't"", 'did', 'something', 'better', 'something', 'earlier', 'teams', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'producers', 'writers', 'had', 'known', 'William', 'Hartnell', 'announced', 'was', 'leaving', 'first', 'incarnation', 'Doctor', 'went', 'sideways', 'delightful', 'effect.Matt', 'Smith', 'qualities', 'would', ""n't"", 'sit', 'well', 'David', 'Doctor', 'suit', 'new', 'direction', 'show', 'tee', 'turns', 'absent-mindedly', 'brilliant', 'goofy', 'geeky', 'thoughtful', 'charming', 'ultimately', 'unique', 'Just', 'prior', 'Doctors', 'have', 'been', 'Again.In', 'addition', 'transition', 'helm', 'being', 'manned', 'Peter', 'Moffett', 'producing', 'many', 'most', 'intricate', 'thoughtful', 'engaging', 'stories', 'high', 'standard', 'set', 'such', 'earlier', 'incarnation', 'episodes', 'brilliant', 'Blink', 'Season', '3', 'being', 'nicely', 'maintained', 'even', 'being', 'played', 'demonstrated', 'Doctors', 'use', 'Matter', 'Transfer', 'wrist', 'devide', 'final', 'episode', 'latest', 'season.All', 'Doctor', 'latest', 'perhaps', 'most', 'charming', 'Companions', 'Rory', 'Amy', 'promise', 'exciting', 'heights', 'be', 'reached', 'Matt', 'second', 'season', 'provided', 'never', 'ever', 'Fez', 'again', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'wrong', 'Really', 'first', 'season', 'are', 'treated', 'fantasic', 'episodic', 'science', 'fiction', 'series', 'merely', 'shifting', 'gears', 'making', 'sharp', 'turn', 'squealing', 'whole', 'way', 'anyone', 'who', 'sci-fi', 'wit', 'excitement', 'thought-provoking', 'concepts', 'could', 'do', 'much', 'worse', 'latest', 'season']",N/A

A few years ago, I'd probably have given this a lower rating. Don't get me wrong I watched the show faithfully, I grew up old Who and I promised I'd stick it out for the new show if there was even a slither of hope for it.I'm happy to say from episode one there was way more than a slither. Yes from series 1-4 the ratio of good episodes and bad episodes were at best 6/13 in favor of the bad shows but when the episodes were good they were usually great. For instance, The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances, Midnight, Silence In the Library/Forest of the Dead, The Impossible Planet/The Satan Pit, Blink, The Runaway Bride, Turn Left, Human Nature/The Family of Blood all great episodes and other than that you have about four or five good episodes so out of 52 episode only about 17 are worth watching (not including Christmas specials), but the ones that are are superb.Then comes series 5 when the show got a new head writer, Steven Moffat (who wrote most of the best episodes of the previous seasons) and the new Doctors, Matt Smith. The shoe still remains uneven but at the most you have one or two bad episodes out of the rest are very good and then there's those special great episodes like The Big Bang, The Impossible Astronaut/Day of the Moon, Amy's Choice, The Doctor's Wife, and The Wedding of Riversong. Far more pleasure without drudging through the embarrassingly bad. The show usually moves along at break neck speeds, it can silly, or gravely serious at the drop of a dime just like its ancient young protagonist, you'll be thrilled by the adventures and engrossed in the human drama.

1338892,A1LPTWPNBPZWJP,B003EV6DBM,Kaan Vural,"[39, 40]","It's a huge pet peeve of mine when people review Doctor Who based on their tastes rather than the objective standards on the show. Doctor Who as a show has changed so often and so radically that there will ALWAYS be parts of the show that, whether or not they are good, just don't appeal to people. If you want darkness and grit, try Season 7. If you want space exploration, avoid it. And so on, and so on.For this reason, I'm going to start with OBJECTIVE commentary - standards of writing, storytelling, etc. - and then proceed to the SUBJECTIVE, as in my personal take on the direction of the show, the style, and the acting.First the objective.THE PLOTSOverall, this is a more tightly written series than the four which preceded it. There's a little more attention to plotting and logic, which is due in no small part to Moffat's talent for writing puzzlebox stories. In past seasons, you always knew you had to suspend a lot of your logical faculties to enjoy the season finales; this time around, it's much more acceptable on that front. There are still exceptions, specifically Victory of the Daleks, but in terms of plot this series is hitting higher peaks and just maintaining a higher average.THE PRODUCTION VALUESThis is something I'm least inclined to give importance, since Doctor Who was always enjoyable regardless of its production, but the effects have definitely improved from the last season. Part of it comes from less overt reliance on CGI for the most part. You certainly don't get anything on the level of the TARDIS towing a planet. Additionally, the locations are substantially more effective and interesting. The Time of Angels/Flesh and Stone, Vincent and the Doctor, Vampires of Venice, and the finale all have examples of great, tactile locations that you could almost believe were real locations.THE SOUNDTRACKAlthough it's still Murray Gold in charge of the music, the tone of the soundtrack has shifted considerably along with the rest of the show. The music tends to be more upbeat, faster and more overtly heroic, as well as a lot more catchy. It's just a lot easier to hum the music you hear in the show.THE CHARACTERS(Note: this is in terms of the writing, not the performances.)There were certain innovations in the cast which I thought were quite interesting, and perhaps necessary. For one thing, we have a male companion who is neither wholly incompetent nor utterly dumped by his girlfriend. Rory does start out in much the same position as Mickey, but unlike him he grows substantially as a character - proving his worth and truly earning his place on the TARDIS by the last episode - and Amy does not abandon him the way Rose abandoned Mickey. As a result, while the two relationships start out on similar pages, this most recent one ends up in a much more palatable place.In terms of writing, Amy Pond is how Rose's character should have been treated in Series 2. Both start out as fairly selfish, obsessed with the Doctor to the point of being rather bratty. In Series 2, however, Rose never grows out of this condition, and the problem is instead solved by having the plot conveniently get her out of the way. In Series 5, however, Amy becomes substantially aware of her own brattiness and takes steps to change. The implied romantic subtext that made the Ten/Rose relationship so thoroughly creepy (please - a nine-hundred-year-old and a nineteen-year-old? Don't insult my intelligence.) threatens to resume here, but...well, let's say the writers knew what they were doing on that score.The Doctor here is largely without a character arc, in sharp contrast to his immediate predecessors. I would be quick to explain to viewers who haven't experienced the Eleventh Doctor, however, that this is a consequence of the change in showrunners. It was Moffat's intention to have a ""safe"" series to which viewers could adjust before ramping up his own style. As a result, we see aspects of the Doctor's future arcs and conflicts foreshadowed, but emotionally speaking the series is not so much about him, but more about his companions.The supporting cast is fairly strong - nothing particularly better- or worse-written than in previous seasons. Memorable characters include Winston Churchill, Rosanna Calvierri, and Liz Ten. River Song also appears in two stories, and given that it's her creator who's writing her character she's hardly mischaracterized.THE BADDIESThe antagonists are all over the map. Standouts are the still-effective Weeping Angels, the Dream Lord, the...shall we say...baddies of the finale. The Earth Reptiles, the Vampires, and the Smilers are middling - decently written, but not necessarily memorable. The Atraxi, the new Daleks, and the Krafayis are less memorable - none of them are given a chance to be truly threatening. Overall, this kind of distribution is basically the standard for the New Series.Now for my subjective interpretations.THE PLOTSAfter the extremely shoddy writing behind The End of Time, I was very happy to watch a Series that didn't insult my intelligence every step of the way. Victory of the Daleks, which does suffer from very shoddy logic, is thankfully over with very early in the season. From then on, any thin plotting is made up for by some other aspect: the atmosphere and the Doctor/Dream Lord interaction in Amy's Choice, Tony Curran in Vincent and the Doctor, and so on. I also enjoyed the comedy, though of course it's going to play differently with different people.The more light-hearted approach this season was also fine with me since a) the Doctor had exorcised a lot of demons in The End of Time and b) after four years of suffering, the guy just needed a holiday. And as a childhood viewer, I was used to light-hearted Doctor Who anyway. But don't worry - they haven't forgotten about his history, and there are some very poignant moments here.THE PRODUCTION VALUESAs I said above, I place little importance on production values. If the Classic Series was good enough for me and countless others as a kid, it should be good enough for kids today. And frankly, I prefer good stories to good production. But maybe that's just me.In general, I'm OK with CGI when it's depicting large-scale events - such as the TARDIS in motion or a planet blowing up or something - but less OK with trying to make CGI work in the creation of monsters. There's a fairly even balance in this series, but I feel they could have gone further. The Atraxi could have remained invisible; Prisoner Zero could easily have been made into a threatening puppet; the Krafayis could have been kept invisible; and so on. But as I said, a lot of the sets are very effective.THE SOUNDTRACKCall me crazy, but I don't like themes you can hum. The Classic Series soundtrack was all about atmosphere; it was about accentuating the situation while letting the characters do their thing. In the New Series there's a greater focus on characters, so it makes sense that there would be leitmotifs; but Murray Gold's work is going to feel very repetitive after a while. The Classic Series music almost felt improvised, which gave it a varied quality. Don't get me wrong; the music is still very good and enjoyable to listen to - but I prefer it when the music stays in the background, if that makes sense.THE CHARACTERSMatt Smith is going to play differently for a lot of people, and the title role is often the biggest point of contention in criticizing the show.What follows is purely my opinion - so take it for what it is - but I never quite bought the Tenth Doctor. This wasn't due to Tennant, who is a very skilled and versatile actor. But the Tenth Doctor never quite convinced me that he was a) an alien or b) 900 years old. Actors such as Tom Baker and Sylvester McCoy, perhaps because of their middling age, were able to portray the Doctor as an ageless character who were always focused on the big picture. The Doctor's age and his alienness are his two most important traits, and for me somehow that mix just didn't come through. By no means was he a bad Doctor - he just wasn't my thing.You might have guessed this, but I found Matt Smith to be an improvement. Smith is of course a younger actor than Tennant, and as with many fans I was hesitant about accepting him when I first looked him up. But Smith has three things going for him. The first is that Smith is EXTREMELY good at playing quirky characters. Watching him, it's difficult not to think that he actually IS an alien in real life. His brand of quirk may rub some people the wrong way, but for me he's so natural in the way he does this that I can't help but buy it.The second is that whether it's because of his looks or his technique, he does in fact come across as a more mature character than Tennant's Doctor. There's a moment in the finale when the Doctor is...let's say sitting next to someone...where he closes his eyes, and it felt like a slap in the face: this guy IS ancient. It always puzzled me why they chose to make the Tenth Doctor so youthfully, given that even the Fifth Doctor played the role like an old man, and so for me this was a breath of fresh air.The third trait is warmth. Simply speaking, you can't help but think the Eleventh Doctor is a really, really nice guy. In fact, this might even work against his character if he tries to be extremely angry or threatening - but that's more a question for Series 6. Taking these traits together, I found Smith convincing as a) an alien, b) a kindly father, and c) a superhero. Smith works for me.The companions are a bit more mixed. I very much enjoy the work of the actor who plays Rory - he's modest and down-trodden, but with deep reserves of strength, courage, and above all else love. I really wanted Rory to become the hero he deserved to be. As for how this pans out...let's say the writers knew what they were doing.I wasn't so impressed by Karen Gillan as Amy Pond. I think it was due in part to Amy's character being deliberately written as initially selfish, but at the same time playing a character like that requires great versatility in an actress - a comic background often helps - and I'm not sure Gillan has quite the range to keep her character likable in ambiguous moments. I was personally more invested in Rory - but, luckily enough, the season's treatment of Rory also enabled Amy to grow in a much more palatable direction.I confess that I never cared all that much for River Song. She's become such an icon to Doctor Who fans that they just can't stop quoting her, which has led her into the habit of having ""catchphrases"" - a writing contrivance I personally despise. But conceptually speaking, there's nothing wrong with her here, and if you liked her in Series 4 you'll like her here too.THE BADDIESNot much to add on this score, except to say that...yes, I also disliked the new Dalek design. The best possible explanation for the color scheme is that it's supposed to be impressive, but my problem with this is that the Daleks were never interested in impressing anyone. Their armor is functional, not pretty. And yes, my favorite scheme is indeed the gunmetal grey from the Fourth Doctor's era. So shoot me.OVERALLThis is a fairly solid season - across the board, I would say the second best after Series 1 (I can't compare to the Classic Series). The main issues people are going to have are taste-related ones. If you don't like Matt Smith; if you didn't want a bit of a lighter approach to Doctor Who (even if only for one year - it gets a lot darker in Series 6); if you miss too many characters from the earlier seasons; if you prefer the ""comic-book"" approach to the ""fairy-tale"" approach, then you'll have trouble appreciating the series.My advice? Don't take it too hard. Don't narrow your expectations too much, and try and get through the Series anyway. Let it digest a little. It's always difficult for fans to make this sort of transition, but it's often healthy to do so. Just don't force it - and you might end up enjoying it a lot more than you thought you would.",4,"Safe, but sharp - Tennant fans should give it a shot",1310428800,"07 12, 2011",2011,12020,"['huge',

Langro ""AVID TV WATCHER""","[0, 1]","i Think that Matt Smith is great as the Doctor, he reminds me in a way of Tom Baker Doctor Who number four, but yet he's not doing a youger version of him.  Yet again the team behind the show, keep on hiring the right actor to protray him.  I love the way he is so unimpressed by the villians, and takes the wind out of their sails!  They think they are going to win, but hell no!  It's the Doctor that does.  I hope that Matt Smith can do a third year, one thing for sure when it's said that a good man is going to die, of course it does'nt mean the show will go, of course not its a ratings winner.  I do have a suggestion, bring back the Time Lords.  No longer have him be the last one, this way it will give the writers more story ideas.  I'm sure that they can do it.  One idea they can have for free, is that someway, somehow the Doctor was'nt offically deposed as the President, and they bring him back, and he has to figure a way out, which of course he does.  He then continues to travel throughout the universe!  And last, but not least Long live the Doctor!  This is really Part Two of my review, about the Doctor dying in 200 years, you know of course the first show of the new season.  Well no way that should happen, like the Enginzer bunnny(batteries) he keeps on going and going and going, well of course you get the idea.  Of course the Doctor will not be killed off eventually, if the writers allow that to happen, well it might be a good idea for them to don duguises and leave the country.  Just kidding, well maybe, no! really just kidding!  The writers will find a way, such as that was not the doctor, he cloned himself, because he was able to see into the future,and is not going to allow anyone to take away his 12th regeneration, which of course he will end up getting a new 12 regeneration cycle.  Which those who know Doctor Who, that in The Five Doctors, the Master was offered a new regeneration cyle, if he helped the fifth Doctor.  So gain long live (of course) the Doctor!",5,KAREN.

1338898,A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2,B003EV6DBM,"Kevin L. Nenstiel ""omnivore""","[3, 7]","Steven Moffatt, Doctor Who's new head writer, has won multiple awards writing for this show and worked with Spielberg, so he must be awesome, right?  Well, maybe not, as this season shows.  I enjoyed this season once through on BBC America, but when I watched the DVD, everything felt thin.  While I can't say this season is bad, it doesn't achieve the standards I've come to expect from Doctor Who.On one hand, Matt Smith's Doctor isn't bad; he looks like an old, old man wearing a young man's body.  Karen Gillan as Amy makes a brash, outspoken foil to the Doctor, keeping him upright and challenging him to greater humanity.  Arthur Darvill's Rory, sadly underutilized, is pretty sharp, too.  And some of this year's villains, like Homo Reptilia or the Dream Lord, recapture the classic series' mystique and glory.On the other hand, Smith waves the sonic screwdriver around so reflexively that it's like he has Tourette's.  Several episodes begin abruptly, with a problem or plot device that leaves writers' fingerprints on the stories, and end with long, talky denouements.  Moffatt's ambitious attempt to graft the season into one long arc, much likeThe Key to Time, often seems strained, struggling to hang together against heavy-handed writing.Many episodes, especially the climactic season-ender, only make sense if you make more leaps of faith than religion.  And I don't use that analogy lightly.  This season makes so many references to churches, bishops, and God that it starts to resemble evangelism.  I don't know if Moffatt and the writers' stable have a secret agenda, or just a pet issue, but whatever it is, they don't conceal it very well.Don't misunderstand: this season isn't bad, nor do I fear it spells the end of Doctor Who.  I just had high hopes, and it doesn't withstand the scrutiny that comes with multiple viewings.  It has many good points, especially Smith himself, who reminds me of both Peter Davison and Paul McGann.  Perhaps things will improve.  After all, it took a year for Russell T. Davies to find his footing, too.",3,Should Have Been Better,1291852800,"12 9, 2010",2010,2056,"['Steven', 'Moffatt', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'new', 'head', 'writer', 'won', 'multiple', 'awards', 'writing', 'show', 'worked', 'Spielberg', 'must', 'be', 'awesome', 'right', 'Well', 'maybe', 'not', 'season', 'enjoyed', 'season', 'once', 'BBC', 'America', 'when', 'watched', 'DVD', 'everything', 'felt', 'thin', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'season', 'bad', ""n't"", 'achieve', 'standards', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'Doctor', 'Who.On', 'one', 'hand', 'Matt', 'Smith', 'Doctor', ""n't"", 'bad', 'old', 'old', 'man', 'wearing', 'young', 'man', 'body', 'Karen', 'Gillan', 'Amy', 'brash', 'outspoken', 'foil', 'Doctor', 'keeping', 'upright', 'challenging', 'greater', 'humanity', 'Arthur', 'Darvill', 'Rory', 'sadly', 'underutilized', 'pretty', 'sharp', 'too', 'year', 'villains', 'Homo', 'Reptilia', 'Dream', 'Lord', 'recapture', 'classic', 'series', 'mystique', 'glory.On', 'other', 'hand', 'Smith', 'sonic', 'screwdriver', 'so', 'reflexively', 'Tourette', 'Several', 'episodes', 'begin', 'abruptly', 'problem', 'plot', 'device', 'writers', 'fingerprints', 'stories', 'end', 'long', 'talky', 'denouements', 'Moffatt', 'ambitious', 'attempt', 'graft', 'season', 'one', 'long', 'arc', 'much', 'likeThe', 'Key', 'Time', 'often', 'strained', 'struggling', 'hang', 'together', 'heavy-handed', 'writing.Many', 'episodes', 'especially', 'climactic', 'season-ender', 'only', 'make', 'sense', 'make', 'more', 'leaps', 'faith', 'religion', 'do', ""n't"", 'use', 'analogy', 'lightly', 'season', 'so', 'many', 'references', 'churches', 'bishops', 'God', 'resemble', 'evangelism', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Moffatt', 'writers', 'stable', 'have', 'secret', 'agenda', 'just', 'pet', 'issue', 'do', ""n't"", 'conceal', 'very', 'well.Do', ""n't"", 'misunderstand', 'season', ""n't"", 'bad', 'do', 'fear', 'end', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'just', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', ""n't"", 'withstand', 'scrutiny', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'many', 'good', 'points', 'especially', 'Smith', 'who', 'Peter', 'Davison', 'Paul', 'McGann', 'Perhaps', 'things', 'will', 'improve', 'took', 'year', 'Russell', 'T.', 'Davies', 'find', 'footing', 'too']",N/A

1338903,AIRCASSWQRZDT,B003EV6DBM,Kolwynia,"[0, 1]","This is the start of a new era for the Doctor and his friends.  Matt Smith takes over as the Doctor, and gathers a few new companions to come with him on his journey through time and space.  Also, Stephen Moffat takes over as the head writer and executive producer of the show.  Does the new series compare to the Russell T. Davies and David Tennant era?  Yes it does.  The story of the Doctor and Amy Pond is a science-fiction fairy tale, spanning ages and entire worlds.  The whole series just feels fresher and more exciting now.  Here are a few reasons to watch:New Companions -- Amy Pond is a great addition to the show.  ""The Girl Who Waited"" seems to have the same tough spirit that Donna Noble had.  She's treats the Doctor like an equal, while at the same time loving him in her own way and realizing that he is something beyond her understanding.  I think she's cool.  Then we get Rory, Amy's fiance, a lovable goof and all around good guy.  He is my personal favorite of the Doctor's new companions.  He's just so out of place on their adventures.  Finally, the mysterious River Song returns to the series.  We learn a little more about her (emphasis on ""little"") this time around.  I enjoy watching her strange, out-of-time relationship with the Doctor play out.  There seems to be something foreboding on the horizon...Old Enemies -- The Daleks return in full force.  Plus we get the return of the Weeping Angels, the terrific villains of the old episode ""Blink.""New Times and Places -- We get to see the Doctor and Amy travel to a space-faring colony of humans, whose lives depend on a terrible secret.  An old enemy appears during World War II in an unlikely place.  The Weeping Angels stalk our heroes through a synthetic forest on board a crashed spacecraft.  Deep within the Hollow Earth, an ancient threat is waking from a long slumber.  Plus, vampires in Venice, an excursion into our heroes' dreams, and an encounter with Vincent van Gogh.A New Doctor -- Matt Smith is wonderful as a brighter, zanier Doctor.  Smith follows on the heels of David Tennant's very popular portrayal of the Doctor.  And, in my opinion, rises to the occasion.  He's quirkier and crazier than Tennant's Doctor, but still holds enough of the character that we feel it's the same traveler of time and space that we know and love.  I love Smith's Doctor, and hope he stays around for a few seasons.A New Adventure -- Previous seasons have had something subtle, like a phrase, dropped into various episodes that hinted at a main storyline for each season.  (Ex: ""Bad Wolf,"" ""Mister Saxon,"" planets going missing...)  The new series does something a little more overt, but it doesn't get in the way of the self-contained episodes throughout the season.  There is a crack in the universe, slowly spreading, following the Doctor and Amy Pond through time and space.  What has damaged the whole universe, and what is the connection to Amy Pond?  It is a good story, intended as a kind of fairy tale.  And the way it all comes together in the finale is epic.If you haven't watched Doctor Who, then this is a great time to get on board the series.  And if you are a fan, this is a great collection of science fiction storytelling, a brand new chapter in the saga of the Doctor and his friends.",5,Something new.,1304208000,"05 1, 2011",2011,3281,"['start', 'new', 'era', 'Doctor', 'friends', 'Matt', 'Smith', 'over', 'Doctor', 'gathers', 'few', 'new', 'companions', 'come', 'journey', 'time', 'space', 'Also', 'Stephen', 'Moffat', 'over', 'head', 'writer', 'executive', 'producer', 'show', 'new', 'series', 'compare', 'Russell', 'T.', 'Davies', 'David', 'Tennant', 'era', 'Yes', 'story', 'Doctor', 'Amy', 'Pond', 'science-fiction', 'fairy', 'tale', 'spanning', 'ages', 'entire', 'worlds', 'whole', 'series', 'just', 'fresher', 'more', 'exciting', 'now', 'Here', 'are', 'few', 'reasons', 'watch', 'New', 'Companions', 'Amy', 'Pond', 'great', 'addition', 'show', 'Girl', 'Who', 'Waited', 'have', 'same', 'tough', 'spirit', 'Donna', 'Noble', 'had', 'treats', 'Doctor', 'equal', 'same', 'time', 'loving', 'own', 'way', 'realizing', 'something', 'understanding', 'think', 'cool', 'Then', 'get', 'Rory', 'Amy', 'fiance', 'lovable', 'goof', 'around', 'good', 'guy', 'personal', 'favorite', 'Doctor', 'new', 'companions', 'just', 'so', 'place', 'adventures', 'Finally', 'mysterious', 'River', 'Song', 'series', 'learn', 'little', 'more', 'emphasis', 'little', 'time', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'strange', 'out-of-time', 'relationship', 'Doctor', 'play', 'out', 'be', 'something', 'foreboding', 'horizon', 'Old', 'Enemies', 'Daleks', 'return', 'full', 'force', 'get', 'return', 'Weeping', 'Angels', 'terrific', 'villains', 'old', 'episode', 'Blink', 'New', 'Times', 'Places', 'get', 'see', 'Doctor', 'Amy', 'travel', 'space-faring', 'colony', 'humans', 'lives', 'depend', 'terrible', 'secret', 'old', 'enemy', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'unlikely', 'place', 'Weeping', 'Angels', 'stalk', 'heroes', 'synthetic', 'forest', 'board', 'crashed', 'spacecraft', 'Deep', 'Hollow', 'Earth', 'ancient', 'threat', 'waking', 'long', 'slumber', 'vampires', 'Venice', 'excursion', 'heroes', 'dreams', 'encounter', 'Vincent', 'van', 'Gogh.A', 'New', 'Doctor', 'Matt', 'Smith', 'wonderful', 'brighter', 'zanier', 'Doctor', 'Smith', 'heels', 'David', 'Tennant', 'very', 'popular', 'portrayal', 'Doctor', 'opinion', 'occasion', 'quirkier', 'crazier', 'Tennant', 'Doctor', 'still', 'enough', 'character', 'feel', 'same', 'traveler', 'time', 'space', 'know', 'love', 'love', 'Smith', 'Doctor', 'hope', 'few', 'seasons.A', 'New', 'Adventure', 'Previous', 'seasons', 'have', 'had', 'something', 'subtle', 'phrase', 'dropped', 'various', 'episodes', 'hinted', 'main', 'storyline', 'season', 'Ex', 'Bad', 'Wolf', 'Mister', 'Saxon', 'going', 'missing', 'new', 'series', 'something', 'little', 'more', 'overt', ""n't"", 'get', 'way', 'self-contained', 'episodes', 'season', 'crack', 'universe', 'slowly', 'spreading', 'following', 'Doctor', 'Amy', 'Pond', 'time', 'space', 'What', 'damaged', 'whole', 'universe', 'what', 'connection', 'Amy', 'Pond', 'good', 'story', 'intended', 'kind', 'fairy', 'tale', 'way', 'together', 'finale', 'epic.If', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'then', 'great', 'time', 'get', 'board', 'series', 'are', 'fan', 'great', 'collection', 'science', 'fiction', 'storytelling', 'brand', 'new', 'chapter', 'saga', 'Doctor', 'friends']",N/A

I hope season 6 is better, I'm the kind of person who waits until the season comes out and watches it without commercials. I don't have cable or converter I just watch dvds.I haven't seen the older version of Doctor Who but at a friends recommendation (and to understand all of his Doctor Who jokes) I started watching it. I LOVED IT! The first season was okay but by the end I was hooked, I just hated that they changed actors. I ended up LOVING David Tennant! :D So when they changed the guy YET again I figured I could roll with the punches and learn to love the new actor but REALLY? I HATED Matt Smith! The dang hair was RIDICULOUS (with David Tennant it suited him), the suite REALLY didn't work for him (same as the hair!!) but the attitude had really improved BUT the MAN CAN'T ACT!! I either wanted to just turn the TV off or fast forward the episode... which I really didn't want to.And another thing I thought the Doctor HATED guns, yet in this season he picks on up! That's one of the reasons I REALLY loved the show, it wasn't some guy picking up girls and running around chasing monsters with guns. And Amy Pond the new companion WOW... all those SHORT skirts, dresses and inappropriate clothes yuck. I was finding myself wishing (I got the dvd's from the library I don't own them), I could go and get the first, second, third and forth series and watching them.

A third of the episodes were okay, the others were HORRIBLE like the Weeping Angles one, it started out confusing, got good and got worse.

1338906,AV4645DYR9KUL,B003EV6DBM,Kyle N.,"[1, 1]","Series 5 of Doctor Who can be described as sort of a ""reset"" of the series, one that inevitably comes with a show where the main character can regenerate an umpteen number of times, bringing in a new face and personality with each one. However, unlike with the first regeneration in the revived series of Doctor Who, this change in Doctors also came with a complete change in cast and crew. The head writer and producer, Russell T. Davies, handed over his position to the equally brilliant Steven Moffat (known for many fan favorites of the series, such as ""The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances"", ""Blink"", and ""Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead""), and many other crew members shifted in positions. Combined with an overhauled cast (the only character from the previous seasons set to return was River Song, herself a Steven Moffat-written character) and a reworked style, this is a whole new season of Doctor Who in many ways. Except one, of course: despite all of the changes, Doctor Who didn't lose any of its charm, style, and brilliance in this transition.After regenerating into his eleventh incarnation at the end of ""The End of Time"", Matt Smith has taken over the role of the Doctor from David Tennant. Just as Tennant was a different yet very much the same Doctor in comparison to Christopher Eccleston, Matt Smith shares many similarities and differences with his predecessor, giving consistency to his character while also making him fresh again (a major reason why regeneration is always a good thing). Smith's Doctor has just the right amount of brilliance, mystery, charm, and darkness in him to ensure that he lives up to his role beautifully. In fact, Smith's kookier and angrier Doctor is a delight to watch just like the actors before him. His new companion, Amy Pond (Karen Gillan), also shares the right similarities and differences with the companions that came before her. Like Martha Jones or Rose Tyler, Amy Pond is adventurous, brave, and a strong-willed young woman, qualities that make her an excellent companion. Moments like the forest scene in ""Flesh and Stone"" prove that she can hold her own and that she is a strong character. However, her flirtatious personality gives her something unique in comparison to her predecessors, and although it may seem like it would become unlikeable at first, it is handled with care and brilliance, and never does Amy truly become an unlikeable character. In fact, her romance over the course of this season with Rory Williams is consistently realistic, believable, and charming. It has its faults in moments, especially midway through the season, but the show's writers keep it from becoming cheap drama and instead build a romance that makes sense and never angers the viewers, and their decision to keep the two together, rather than give Amy a romance with the Doctor, is one that will make many fans happy. The last two mainstays of the season, Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill) and River Song (Alex Kingston) (who was previously introduced in series four in a very interesting and totally Doctor Who way), both are just as well developed and interesting as the rest of the cast, and they also stand out as strong, likeable characters. River especially has just the right amount of mystery and understanding surrounding her character, as more about her relationship with the Doctor and who she is are revealed this season.As previously implied, the writing in this series stays consistently brilliant and doesn't falter in the transition. Many of the episodes in this season are great. With standouts like the creepy ""The Time of Angels/Flesh and Stone"", the wonderful ""Amy's Choice"", the thematic ""The Hungry Earth/Cold Blood"", the fun and great ""Vincent and the Doctor"", and lastly, the intense and epic finale ""The Pandorica Opens/The Big Bang"", this season remains just as enjoyable as the previous four. This season's myth arc, dealing with the ""cracks in time"", takes a departure from the villain-centric myth arcs of past seasons, a nice move that compliments the season well, giving a new way of telling the over-arching narrative that pays off well in the season finale. Not to mention, it is just as intriguing as those of the past. Like ""Bad Wolf"" or ""the stars are going out"", it carries a constant and mysterious presence throughout the season that keeps the viewer interested and reveals itself in just the right portions, with some really excellent and mind blowing clues given. The show doesn't lose any of its humor, either, as the new Doctor's kooky-ness or the banter between the Doctor, Amy, and Rory can attest to. Great comedic moments are sprinkled throughout, keeping the show from ever taking itself too seriously (because guess what, it doesn't!). Although the show is never known for its logic and science (it still isn't; hard science-fiction this is not), the characters and narrative are always great and never falter over the course of the season.The production is also just as great, too. The new theme tune, while it takes some getting used to (and still doesn't fully compare to the epic version that graced series four), is still excellent and the new opener is nice and flashy, while also fitting the slightly different style of the new season. The logo itself also fits the new season well, adding to the fresh new feel of the show. The effects continue to wow, with some great monsters appearing, such as the vampires in Venice or Prisoner Zero, ones that can scare and intrigue at the same time. The make-up and design for the humanoid aliens is also still excellent, with some great designs appearing over the course of the season (including some great cameos in a certain episode). Lastly, the set pieces are still phenomenal this season, with Starship UK, the underground in ""Cold Blood"", and the Earth's sky in ""The Big Bang"" all working well to complement their episodes and set the right tones, especially in the case of the last example. Even the TARDIS gets a makeover, becoming a flashy piece of beauty that fits the Eleventh Doctor perfectly. The music also stays consistent and great, with shining examples that set the mood, like when the Pandorica is finally seen in its mysterious way in ""The Big Bang"".Overall, this season didn't lose a single touch of the excellence from the seasons before it. The writing and production of the show stay consistent, and the reboot that accompanies the new Doctor is fresh and exciting. Anyone worried that the show would falter when Steven Moffat took over has no need to worry. Despite all of the changes to the show, this is still the same Doctor Who.",5,A revamped Doctor Who that doesn't lose its quality.,1376179200,"08 11, 2013",2013,6617,"['Series', '5', 'Doctor', 'Who',

I was amazed at how the formula could stay intact through two doctors and several female companions.So I put the first disc of Season 5 into may computer with a mixture of dread and anticipation and ...fell asleep before the end of the episode (OK, I was a bit tired when I started and I did see most of it).The ""production values"" are there, but the endearing doctor is out.  He seems to be sort of an immature jerk, which actually could have worked and been a great idea if he had somehow teamed up with a strong female lead who could help with his character while he saved the universe every week.  That would have been a fun new take on an old formula.But this is the old formula just implemented badly in my opionion.  Maybe it just takes a few episodes for the new characters to gain their footing.  I've seen this happen in other series, and I know not to judge an entire series on the pilot, which the first episode with a new doctor sort of is.  I just cant bring myself to watch any more.  Maybe try to see an episode or two before you plunk down money and buy it.Update: So I decided to give it another chance and watched two more episodes.  In the third episode we find that the Daleks have infiltrated the British military during World War II (Battle of Britain to be precise).  To make a tedious story short, toward the end a Dalek mother ship appears above London and threatens to blow it up.  I thought to myself -- in Winston Churchill's voice -- that it's nothing a few Spitfires can't handle.  And then I see Spitfires attacking the Dalek ship.So, it come to this.  The stupidest dirction I can think of taking a story is now exactly what I see minutes later.  It's like it's been dumbed down and targeted at a different audience.My wife hasn't seen much of the earlier seasons, and I think I'd rather watch season (""series"" for you across the pond) one again than continue with Dr. Whatever.",2,A doctor too far.,1302998400,"04 17, 2011",2011,2046,"[""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'first', 'four', 'seasons', 'was', 'never', 'fan', 'traditional', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'well', 'let', 'say', 'previous', 'century', 'was', 'amazed', 'how', 'formula', 'could', 'stay', 'intact', 'two', 'doctors', 'several', 'female', 'companions.So', 'put', 'first', 'disc', 'Season', '5', 'may', 'computer', 'mixture', 'dread', 'anticipation', 'fell', 'asleep', 'end', 'episode', 'OK', 'was', 'bit', 'tired', 'when', 'started', 'did', 'see', 'most', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'there', 'endearing', 'doctor', 'out', 'be', 'sort', 'immature', 'jerk', 'actually', 'could', 'have', 'worked', 'been', 'great', 'idea', 'had', 'somehow', 'teamed', 'up', 'strong', 'female', 'lead', 'who', 'could', 'help', 'character', 'saved', 'universe', 'week', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fun', 'new', 'take', 'old', 'formula.But', 'old', 'formula', 'just', 'implemented', 'badly', 'opionion', 'Maybe', 'just', 'few', 'episodes', 'new', 'characters', 'gain', 'footing', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'happen', 'other', 'series', 'know', 'not', 'judge', 'entire', 'series', 'pilot', 'first', 'episode', 'new', 'doctor', 'sort', 'just', 'cant', 'bring', 'watch', 'more', 'Maybe', 'try', 'see', 'episode', 'two', 'plunk', 'down', 'money', 'buy', 'it.Update', 'So', 'decided', 'give', 'chance', 'watched', 'two', 'more', 'episodes', 'third', 'episode', 'find', 'Daleks', 'have', 'infiltrated', 'British', 'military', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Battle', 'Britain', 'be', 'precise', 'make', 'tedious', 'story', 'short', 'end', 'Dalek', 'mother', 'ship', 'London', 'blow', 'up', 'thought', 'myself', 'Winston', 'Churchill', 'voice', 'nothing', 'few', 'Spitfires', 'ca', ""n't"", 'handle', 'then', 'see', 'Spitfires', 'attacking', 'Dalek', 'ship.So', 'stupidest', 'dirction', 'can', 'think', 'taking', 'story', 'now', 'exactly', 'what', 'see', 'minutes', 'later', 'been', 'dumbed', 'down', 'targeted', 'different', 'audience.My', 'wife', ""n't"", 'seen', 'much', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'think', ""'d"", 'rather', 'watch', 'season', 'series', 'pond', 'one', 'again', 'continue', 'Dr.', 'Whatever']",N/A

And while I was disappointed in his version of Doctor Who for its soap opera stylings and poor science fiction content, I could at least understand why it was popular.With this season, the ""showrunner"" switched from Davies to Steven Moffat, the creator of ""Coupling."" Many fans - including myself - expected Moffat to come riding in like the cavalry and make Doctor Who a cool, gothic, real science fiction show again. Alas, in the end, Moffat brings nothing to the table but nostalgia. Unlike the progressive Davies, he presents an all-Caucasian cast that hangs out in a quaint (that is, unreal) English country village - hurling the show's sensibilities back in time about 50 years. And also unlike Davies, who could at least write comprehensible scripts, Moffat loses himself in convoluted, nerdy plots that are heavy on continuity and alienating to casual viewers; note that this is exactly the kind of writing that doomed the original Doctor Who back in the 1980s.And there are many other flaws in this season, apart from the writing. Matt Smith is clearly miscast as the Doctor, and his age has nothing to do with it; he simply doesn't project intelligence, or any kind of gravitas. Indeed, the defining trait of his Doctor is a goofy sense of humor that rarely proves to be funny. From his irritating catchphrase (""bow ties are cool"") to his frivolous observation that Vincent van Gogh's children would be ""the ultimate ginge,"" Smith makes a range of stupid comments that drag down the character's IQ about fifty points. Is this really the same man who used to boast of hanging out with Chairman Mao, and who used to say things like ""your species has the most amazing capacity for self-deception, matched only by its ingenuity when trying to destroy itself""?The production values are yet another source of disappointment here. Anyone who thinks the new Doctor Who has a huge budget ought to carefully examine the scene in which the new Daleks - which resemble giant fire hydrants painted in gaudy colors - emerge from a swirl of dry ice, into a ""spaceship"" set that resembles a factory basement (which is probably what it was). Only a few episodes here, like the unusually strong Weeping Angel two-parter, manage to achieve the cinematic, Pan's Labyrinth-style look that the production team was going for.In short, this version of Doctor Who is nothing but nostalgic silliness - a kitsch re-imagining of a superior old show that was cheesier but smarter. The Davies version of the show, for all its glaring flaws, at least felt like something *new* in addition to being nostalgic. The Moffat vision is a step backward. If Doctor Who ever gets another showrunner, I don't want it to be another geeky fan who loves the original series and views the whole enterprise through a rose-tinted haze; I want to show to be written by a sharper, less nostalgic writer who isn't afraid to make the Doctor brilliant again and to cast a somewhat tougher actor in the role (Jason Isaacs? Idris Elba?) Anything, to me, would be preferable to watching a goofball Doctor confront a tangerine-colored Dalek in a basement...",2,Time to get disappointed all over again,1317772800,"10 5, 2011",2011,3374,"['did', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'Russell', 'T.', 'Davies', 'vision', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'guy', 'was', 'least', 'progressive', 'successfully', 'dragged', 'show', '21st', 'century', 'giving', 'somewhat', 'convincing', 'urban', 'setting', 'making', 'cast', 'racially', 'sexually', 'diverse', 'was', 'disappointed', 'version', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'soap', 'opera', 'stylings', 'poor', 'science', 'fiction', 'content', 'could', 'least', 'understand', 'why', 'was', 'popular.With', 'season', 'showrunner', 'switched', 'Davies', 'Steven', 'Moffat', 'creator', 'Coupling', 'Many', 'fans', 'including', 'expected', 'Moffat', 'come', 'riding', 'cavalry', 'make', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'cool', 'gothic', 'real', 'science', 'fiction', 'show', 'again', 'Alas', 'end', 'Moffat', 'nothing', 'table', 'nostalgia', 'progressive', 'Davies', 'all-Caucasian', 'cast', 'out', 'quaint', 'unreal', 'English', 'country', 'village', 'hurling', 'show', 'sensibilities', 'back', 'time', '50', 'years', 'also', 'Davies', 'who', 'could', 'least', 'write', 'comprehensible', 'scripts', 'Moffat', 'convoluted', 'nerdy', 'plots', 'are', 'heavy', 'continuity', 'alienating', 'casual', 'viewers', 'exactly', 'kind', 'writing', 'doomed', 'original', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'back', '1980s.And', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'flaws', 'season', 'apart', 'writing', 'Matt', 'Smith', 'clearly', 'miscast', 'Doctor', 'age', 'nothing', 'do', 'simply', ""n't"", 'project', 'intelligence', 'kind', 'gravitas', 'Indeed', 'defining', 'trait', 'Doctor', 'goofy', 'sense', 'humor', 'rarely', 'be', 'funny', 'irritating', 'catchphrase', 'bow', 'ties', 'are', 'cool', 'frivolous', 'observation', 'Vincent', 'Gogh', 'children', 'would', 'be', 'ultimate', 'ginge', 'Smith', 'range', 'stupid', 'comments', 'drag', 'character', 'IQ', 'fifty', 'points', 'really', 'same', 'man', 'who', 'used', 'boast', 'hanging', 'out', 'Chairman', 'Mao', 'who', 'used', 'say', 'things', 'species', 'most', 'amazing', 'capacity', 'self-deception', 'matched', 'only', 'ingenuity', 'when', 'trying', 'destroy', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'yet', 'source', 'disappointment', 'here', 'Anyone', 'who', 'new', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'huge', 'budget', 'ought', 'carefully', 'examine', 'scene', 'new', 'Daleks', 'resemble', 'giant', 'fire', 'hydrants', 'painted', 'gaudy', 'colors', 'emerge', 'swirl', 'dry', 'ice', 'spaceship', 'set', 'factory', 'basement', 'probably', 'what', 'was', 'Only', 'few', 'episodes', 'here', 'unusually', 'strong', 'Weeping', 'Angel', 'two-parter', 'manage', 'achieve', 'cinematic', 'Pan', 'Labyrinth-style', 'look', 'production', 'team', 'was', 'going', 'for.In', 'short', 'version', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'nothing', 'nostalgic', 'silliness', 'kitsch', 're-imagining', 'superior', 'old', 'show', 'was', 'cheesier', 'smarter', 'Davies', 'version', 'show', 'glaring', 'flaws', 'least', 'felt', 'something', '*new*', 'addition', 'being', 'nostalgic', 'Moffat', 'vision', 'step', 'backward', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'ever', 'showrunner', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'geeky', 'fan', 'who', 'original', 'series', 'whole', 'enterprise', 'rose-tinted', 'haze', 'want', 'show', 'be', 'written', 'sharper', 'less', 'nostalgic', 'writer', 'who', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'make', 'Doctor', 'brilliant', 'again', 'cast', 'somewhat', 'tougher', 'actor', 'role', 'Jason', 'Isaacs', 'Idris', 'Elba', 'Anything', 'would', 'be', 'preferable', 'watching', 'goofball', 'Doctor', 'tangerine-colored', 'Dalek', 'basement']",N/A

I feel that this fifth season of the 'new' Doctor falls short on story and science.I have to agree with several points made in the Richard C.

Also, bring back all the rooms - could even do a show on it.The eleventh doctor... not so bad.  A always miss the old doctor for awhile then get used to the new one.  As to Matt Smith, I didn't like anything about him at the very first, but he grew on me.  By the end of the season I liked him quite well (but a return to David Tenent wouldn't upset me). He just needs a better writer.Finally, I'd like to see some fresh stuff; new planets, new aliens, solid science, better stories, an updated K-9 (like a robot that looks like a real dog), possibly a multiple-doctor story (that happened a few times before).P.S.

Davies was leaving, but I was hoping that the author of ""Blink"" will not let us down!This is a NEW Doctor all right. If you believe me, it's the best! It's all nerdy and fast thinking and caring, but Matt Smith brings a new depth that David Tennant was trying to achieve in his last episodes. It's this mystery and darkness and profoundness that the Doctor should have, someone you love and admire but that you also fear a bit, someone that you can never grasp completely because he is so much more... A Time Lord! Chris Eccleston had that, just a look in his eyes that brought you galaxies and eons away...the Fire and the Storm  brewing. Tennant developed it slowly through the painful 2nd Season where the relationship with Rose was getting ridiculous! But he was also loud, flashy and a little hyper. Smith's Doctor seems a wiser, more mature incarnation by comparison!Speaking of Rose, Amy Pond is in a league of her own! Makes Rose really look like an airhead by comparison! She is quick, witty and picks things up on the way, this is by far the smartest companion, beats Martha Jones! This is Gwen Cooper without the drama and soapy tendencies!( if you haven't watch Torchwood yet, give it a try!)Way to go Karen Gillan!If you expect the ""thrills"" and ""fireworks"" we got used to during Davies' era, this series is more somber, maybe the BBC budget cuts are being felt, there is less ""flashiness"". But what is lost in that is gained in the witty script,and exceptional acting of Smith and Gillan. And YES, it's still sexy!No words are too little to acknowledge Steven Moffat's achievement, to take command after Davies and to actually improve the series... That is some feat! The previews on the internet are deceiving, everything looks so much better on the DVD, the new logo, the style, I was skeptic but I had no problem switching. It is more reverend to the look of the old series but no worries, it's by no means ""quaint""! It's cool retro!Did I say enough about Matt Smith? I can't praise him enough! This kid is phenomenal!

I heard back from customer service the same day, with a promise to contact me, but I received no contact after the first.  However, the next day, I started to view the episode on my computer.  Found the sound restored, then downloaded (with credit restored) to my TIVO.For me, this was a frustrating episode.  Personally, I prefer one complete episode rather than a three episode finale.  After one look, my husband said that they were trying to unsuccessfully top the Cliff Hanger in Season 1 of Andromeda.Still, leaving three major characters in trouble leaves one wondering how they would be able to get out of the mess, and it also gives the writers three different corners to write themselves out of.It never dawned on me what the monster in the Pandora Box was.  I'm back to speculating about what Riversong is.  The Riversong character in the Matt Smith episodes seems less in awe of the Doctor than in the library episodes with David Tennant.  I wonder if that's because Riversong seems physically older than the Doctor at this point, while in the library episodes, she was closer to his own age.  I don't remember the Sweety reference in the library episodes.  She's also a younger more roguish Riversong.  And seems to have a love hate relationship.  ""If he's dead, I'll never forgive you, and if he's alive, I'll never forgive him.""  But later she refers to him as ""my love.""  Wondering how long they'll stretch out the story arc.  If Riversong really is the Doctor's daughter, they could stretch out the relationship indefinitely.  To me, the sweety reference seems more like a nickname between family, and relationships would be strange if the father looks younger than the daughter.  I also wonder why they didn't bump into Captain Jack Harkness, since he's from the same time period that Riversong had been imprisoned.A nice monster reunion from the creatures they'd brought out since the 2005 version of Doctor Who began.",4,Good Episode!,1279411200,"07 18, 2010",2010,2000,"['previous', 'review', 'sound', 'have', 'been', 'deleted', 'heard', 'back', 'customer', 'service', 'same', 'day', 'promise', 'contact', 'received', 'contact', 'first', 'However', 'next', 'day', 'started', 'view', 'episode', 'computer', 'sound', 'restored', 'then', 'downloaded', 'credit', 'restored', 'TIVO.For', 'was', 'frustrating', 'episode', 'Personally', 'prefer', 'one', 'complete', 'episode', 'rather', 'three', 'episode', 'finale', 'one', 'look', 'husband', 'said', 'were', 'trying', 'unsuccessfully', 'top', 'Cliff', 'Hanger', 'Season', '1', 'Andromeda.Still', 'leaving', 'three', 'major', 'characters', 'trouble', 'one', 'wondering', 'how', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'mess', 'also', 'writers', 'three', 'different', 'corners', 'write', 'out', 'of.It', 'never', 'dawned', 'what', 'monster', 'Pandora', 'Box', 'was', ""'m"", 'back', 'speculating', 'what', 'Riversong', 'Riversong', 'character', 'Matt', 'Smith', 'less', 'awe', 'Doctor', 'library', 'episodes', 'David', 'Tennant', 'wonder', 'because', 'Riversong', 'physically', 'older', 'Doctor', 'point', 'library', 'episodes', 'was', 'closer', 'own', 'age', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'Sweety', 'reference', 'library', 'episodes', 'also', 'younger', 'more', 'roguish', 'Riversong', 'have', 'love', 'hate', 'relationship', 'dead', ""'ll"", 'never', 'forgive', 'alive', ""'ll"", 'never', 'forgive', 'later', 'refers', 'love', 'Wondering', 'how', 'long', ""'ll"", 'stretch', 'out', 'story', 'arc', 'Riversong', 'really', 'Doctor', 'daughter', 'could', 'stretch', 'out', 'relationship', 'indefinitely', 'sweety', 'reference', 'more', 'nickname', 'family', 'relationships', 'would', 'be', 'strange', 'father', 'younger', 'daughter', 'also', 'wonder', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'bump', 'Captain', 'Jack', 'Harkness', 'same', 'time', 'period', 'Riversong', 'had', 'been', 'imprisoned.A', 'nice', 'monster', 'reunion', 'creatures', ""'d"", 'brought', 'out', '2005', 'version', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'began']",N/A

It's not so bad that I won't watch the show, but I much prefer seasons 1-4.  I'm a recent Doctor Who convert and I'm loving the show in general, but with season 5 and 6 the attitude changed and I liked it better the other way.  Matt Smith plays the Doctor like an idiot savant, rather than a highly intelligent man acting a fool to disarm his opponents.  Amy is sometimes so stupid I want to strangle her.  The episodes themselves have lost something that I find hard to describe, but that was, it seemed to me, and integral part of what made Doctor Who what it was.  While it is interesting and fun to see ties between episodes now and then, this season is nothing but ties back and forth.  It plays more like a strange soap opera, which I really do not care for.  I am highly disappointed, but as I said, not to the point I will not watch the series.  It is still good, just not 5 star good any more.As for the Blu-ray DVD, I always prefer them to the standard.

1338937,A21HAN5XF6M22X,B003EV6DBM,Michael L. Emery,"[37, 48]","Tom Baker was ""my Doctor"" growing up, I ""tolerated"" Peter Davison when he took over, and then when Colin Baker became The Doctor I completely lost interest and stayed away from anything Doctor Who.Then in 2010, I was told that BBC had brought back Doctor Who and that Christopher Eccleston was ""fantastic.' Though I resisted at first, my girlfriend convinced me to checked them out (she had the first 4 seasons on DVD.) My faith in quality Doctor Who stories (and a quality Doctor) was renewed.When Christopher left I was anticipating a crappy replacement but David Tennant blew me away with his performance! In fact, David Tennant rivaled my feelings about Tom Baker as being ""my Doctor."" So when I heard that David Tennant would be leaving the role after ""End of Time"" I was again worried that a crappy replacement would follow.I watch the first episode of this current season, and through most of it I was not all that impressed by Matt Smith. He seemed too goofy, like he was trying to hard.****SPOILER ALERT****Then came the scene atop the Hospital, where The Doctor faces down the Atraxi. He asks, ""Is this planet protected?"" and the sequence that follows, leading up to Matt Smith stepping through the projected images of past Doctors and saying, ""Hello, I'm The Doctor."" and then with unblinking eyes he says, ""Basically...run!""****END OF SPOILER****That scene won me over and I felt that he might make a good Doctor after all.My review of the CHARACTERS:The Doctor:In the past, he always managed to stay calm and even arrogant enough to believe that even though he had no clue how he would resolve the latest crisis, a solution would come to him. The Doctor multi-tasks, so sometimes he seems lost in his own world...however Matt Smith seems to come off more like the Doctor has ADHD. While most of the time I enjoyed Matt's performance, it had lots of moments when I just did not feel that engaged. Overall, I like his performance, I just hope he's able to make me LOVE his performance in the sixth season.Amy:This companion took me a couple of episodes to accept, as she had spotty moments where her attempt at humor felt forced and her behavior/emotions seemed switch without a logical transition. While she is NO Rose Tyler (then again, no one in my opinion was a better companion than she) or Martha, I liked her far better than Donna.Rory:Amy's boyfriend was at first annoying to me, he seemed too wimpy, then I grew to really like him with each episode.My review of the WRITING:Since Moffet was the writer of ""Blink"" which was one of my top favorite Tennant episodes, I expected the series to be on par. sadly, it was some of the weakest writing since the series relaunched. Granted, Actress Carey Mulligan was a large part of why ""Blink"" was so good in my opinion; the writing/story was actually smart and creative. NONE of the episodes in this season were equal in enjoyment for me.For one thing, the Dalex episode had a weak ""logic"" as to why they were in WWII (I won't spoil it by saying why they're there). I did like the new Daleks though, they add a new level to the intimidating factor!The episode marking the return of the Weeping Angels felt like Moffet wrote the episode as they shot scenes; very disjointed and not captivating at all!The finale episode storyline was probably the biggest letdown. It was built up all through the season then fell flat and had me scratching my head and wondering if they had just made this up right before filming or did they really have this worked out all along?I was left feeling as if Moffet let his ego get the better of him, as if he thought he could only write gold. I say this because unlike the past four seasons, none of these episodes make me eager to watch them a second time unless I need reminding of something later. Simply put, I can name scenes that are my favorite but not one single episode that I would consider a favorite.My main gripe about the episodes is that they focused less on the science and more on trying to seem cool and hip.My review of The Product:The packaging is well done. Mine has a lenticular face, which was cool.The interior, like the previous four seasons, has a nice ""busy but organized"" look.You get three illustrated cards and the artwork is impressive.I love that they kept with the format of having various characters from the show colorfully displayed on each disk.As for the bonus features, I loved Matt Smith better in his ""Video Diary"" sections than him as The Doctor, so I have faith his performance can improve.The extras as a whole were very fulfilling. My only gripe is all the interview sections with Moffet, he comes off as very full of himself and I got tired of him pretty fast.While I can not say that this is a MUST HAVE for all Doctor Who fans, it is worth checking out. I liked it well enough to look forward to watching the new season.If you don't really care about bonus features or collectible cards and just want to watch the show, my suggestion is to take advantage of Amazon's Video On Demand to watch them.",3,It won me over...but...,1296777600,"02 4, 2011",2011,5036,"['Tom', 'Baker', 'was', 'Doctor', 'growing', 'up', 'tolerated', 'Peter', 'Davison', 'when',

I was very skeptical about the idea of trying to resurrect the series, but for once, proven wrong. Series 1 was good, 2 was better, and 3 was amazing. Series 4 showed the beginnings of Russel T Davies burning out, but was still mostly good. Then there was the non-series of 5 specials (series 4.5?), which had 2 good episodes, and 3 awful episodes. RTD was definately burned out, and allowing it to hurt the show.So, now the man responsible for 4 of the best stories of the previous 4 years was going to be in charge. Great. Should be absolutely amazing.It wasn't. It was awful. The first 2 stories are OK, but do more to establish the companion than the Doctor. Eating fish sticks with porridge and saying ""Bow Ties are Cool."" is not establishing a new personality. The Doctor is badly neglected by the writers. After the first 2 episodes, the writing plunges into the depths of mediocrity and starts sinking. Below the quality of American Television. Below Oprah. And down.I honestly cannot express how awful the writing of these episodes is--both dialog itself and the overall ideas.After nearly 30 years of watching Doctor Who, this series made me want to give up on any future stories. THAT is how bad it was.I certainly would not buy the DVDs. If given a box as a present, I would trade it in for store credit or throw it away.Honestly, they are not worth owning. Not even for a completionist.Not even for the music--which followed the same quality as the series writing (Good, Better, Amazing, meh, oh there was BGM?, yuck).Steven Moffet: Shame on you.",1,An awful disaster,1311206400,"07 21, 2011",2011,1610,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'early', '80s', 'was', 'very', 'skeptical', 'idea', 'trying', 'resurrect', 'series', 'once', 'proven', 'wrong', 'Series', '1', 'was', 'good', '2', 'was', 'better', '3', 'was', 'amazing', 'Series', '4', 'showed', 'beginnings', 'Russel', 'T', 'Davies', 'burning', 'out', 'was', 'still', 'mostly', 'good', 'Then', 'was', 'non-series', '5', 'specials', 'series', '4.5', 'had', '2', 'good', 'episodes', '3', 'awful', 'episodes', 'RTD', 'was', 'definately', 'burned', 'out', 'allowing', 'hurt', 'show.So', 'now', 'man', 'responsible', '4', 'best', 'stories', 'previous', '4', 'years', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'charge', 'Great', 'Should', 'be', 'absolutely', 'amazing.It', 'was', ""n't"", 'was', 'awful', 'first', '2', 'stories', 'are', 'OK', 'do', 'more', 'establish', 'companion', 'Doctor', 'Eating', 'fish', 'sticks', 'porridge', 'saying', 'Bow', 'Ties', 'are', 'Cool', 'not', 'establishing', 'new', 'personality', 'Doctor', 'badly', 'neglected', 'writers', 'first', '2', 'episodes', 'writing', 'depths', 'mediocrity', 'sinking', 'quality', 'American', 'Television', 'Oprah', 'honestly', 'can', 'not', 'express', 'how', 'awful', 'writing', 'episodes', 'dialog', 'overall', 'ideas.After', 'nearly', '30', 'years', 'watching', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'series', 'made', 'want', 'give', 'up', 'future', 'stories', 'how', 'bad', 'certainly', 'would', 'not', 'buy', 'DVDs', 'given', 'box', 'present', 'would', 'trade', 'store', 'credit', 'throw', 'away.Honestly', 'are', 'not', 'worth', 'owning', 'Not', 'even', 'completionist.Not', 'even', 'music', 'followed', 'same', 'quality', 'series', 'writing', 'Good', 'Better', 'Amazing', 'meh', 'was', 'BGM', 'yuck', '.Steven', 'Moffet', 'Shame']",N/A

Daleks in World War Two was going to happen sooner or later - it was just a matter of time.  I don't wish to spoil anything but the stories were good, many were tight and without plot holes, and frankly I enjoyed it.The Bad - If you took the Doctor and his friends out of some of the episodes and replaced them with the main characters from Farscape, or Stargate, or Land of the Lost, or The Sarah Jane Smith Adventures you would not in any way upset that individual story.  It is good science fiction but not yet reached the level of good Doctor Who.  But give Matt Smith time.

I had absolutely loved David Tennant and Chris Eccleston, and these were some very large shoes to fill. Fortunately, Matt Smith gave me a delightful surprise and ended up owning the character in his own lighter way. He isnt as grave as the 9th doctor, nor as intense as Tennant's take. Considering the things that were happening in the doctor's life at the time those actors were portraying him (lost love, recovering from a lost people) it is not surprising that Smith's version is less damaged and more carefree. Don't get me wrong, I ADORE the previous incarnations, I'm just saying the evolution in personality at this time makes sense. It's reminiscent of when Tom Baker took over the reins in the early seventies with his big grin and goofy scarf - just replace it with big hair and a goofy (but cool) bow tie.I wasn't at all sure about Amy until I realised later in the series that we weren't talking about 'just' Amy but her interraction and role in a larger cast of characters including River Song. When placed in the Doctor's 'party' of travellers, she is an effective companion. She certainly isnt pulling off all the notes and expressions of Donna Noble or filling the doctor's heart and soul like Rose Tyler, but at this stage of the doctor's life I think that with the rest of the ensemble she does an admirable job. It's important not to consider her as a replacement for companions of the past because if you do, she doesnt feel (to me at least) like she is completing the picture, especially in the beginning episodes when you really focus on her.It's definitely not the same as previous seasons. The darkness often appears and a few episodes have very sad moments, but theres a resilience in Matt Smith's doctor and an impeccable sense of comedic timing. If Tennant's doctor towards the end was a 'glass is half empty' kind of guy, Smith's is almost certainly 'half full'. Despite his youthful appearance he comes off as far far older.

1338958,A3TISHGXRLMTTV,B003EV6DBM,Patrick Correa,"[1, 1]","Having witnessed how awesome a Doctor Matt Smith makes after watching the 2nd half of series 6, I decided to start from his beginning (although to be honest, it was the only set of the new series in my price range).  But thank you Amazon, for putting this on sale.  It was one of the best $20 I've ever spent in my whole life.  This season is just excellent, for the most part.  Here's a review of each episode:The Eleventh Hour:  The newly regenerated Doctor has 20 minutes to save the world and only Amy Pond can help him. If you can get past the overly long & very stupid scene where he tries food, this episode is awesome.  It's worth it just for the scene where The Doctor confronts the Atraxi.  AThe Beast Below:  The Doctor Takes Amy to a distant future, where she finds all of Britain in a giant spaceship.  This is the sort of story I became to expect toward the end of series 6.  It's a very interesting one-off story with a great ending.  AVictory of the Daleks:  The Doctor is summoned to blitz torn London by Winston Churchill - and the Daleks are waiting for him!  This is something of a miss.  For the most part it's good, but the Daleks escaping at the end sort of ruins it.  B-The Time of Angels:  Don't blink - the Doctor hunts the last of the Weeping Angels through the terrifying Maze of the Dead.  I had not seen Blink before I saw this episode, but that didn't keep me from finding it excellent.  A+Flesh and Stone:  Surrounded by an army of Weeping Angels, the Doctor & his friends must escape through the forest.  This is another excellent episode, making this one of the greatest 2 part stories in the new show.A+Vampires of Venice: Dessicated corpses and terror in the canals - the Doctor takes Amy and Rory to 17th Century Venice.  This is a great episode with one of the best monsters of the week and some very funny moments.  AAmy's Choice:  It's been 5 years since Amy saw the Doctor, and when he reappears, she faces a terrible choice.  This is an incredibly good episode that keeps you guessing.  A+The Hungry Earth:  The most ambitious drilling project ever reaches far below the Earth's crust - but the ground is fighting back.  The nadir of the season, perhaps even of the whole new series.  Everyone acted stupidly.  Seriously, I can't think of any single episode worse than this one.  FCold Blood:  The Earth faces the dawn of a new age of harmony, or the start of its final war.  It's more of the same idiotic writing as the first.  The ending, or rather everything from when the crack showed up, was excellent but that does not make up for the preachy & stupid story.  This is by far the worst 2 part episode in the new show.  DVincent & the Doctor:  The Doctor & Amy Pond meet Vincent Van Gogh, and help him fight a monster.  Aside from how they suddenly felt sad when the beast died, this was an excellent episode.  AThe Lodger:  The Doctor must solve the mystery of the staircase that people go up, but never down.  This episode was a disappointment to me.  I loved the second episode with Craig, & thought the first one would be as good.  There's far too much stalling and not enough good comedy, but the central idea was good.  C-The Pandorica Opens: The Doctor's friends unite to send him a terrible warning - the Pandorica is opening.  Only one word can describe this episode: epic.  Everything from this season really came together.  This also had one of the top 10 most suspenseful cliffhangers in Doctor Who ever.  A+Big Bang: The last hope for all reality is a little girl who still believes in stars...  The series finale continues to rock.  This is the best 2 part story I've seen of the whole series so far, & this part is the best one of the season.  A+So, it came to basically 2 dollars for every outstanding episode (9), and 2 dollars extra for the special features.  Definitely a great deal.  Matt Smith is definitely one of my top 3 Doctors (along with Tom Baker & David Tennant) and this was a great season, even if there were a few duds.

1338962,A1CIZ90FFOZTLM,B003EV6DBM,phantomfan,"[11, 16]","I had extremely high expectations going into season 5 because I am such a huge fan of Steven Moffatt. Also, as a fan of the original Dr Who I am aware that the series, by its nature, reinvents itself every few years, so the prospect of a new doctor and a new start was exciting to me.I was, however, a little disappointed to hear so many negative reviews early on, and when I finally got the box set I was prepared to be let down. And while I can think of several ways in which the series could be better, I was pleasantly surprised to find, nay-sayers aside, that season five is by far the best yet.I found that there was a maturity in the storytelling and a restraint in the later episodes that was completely lacking in previous seasons. Yes, the finale was big, but it was also subtle and masterfully restrained, and didn't insult my intelligence like previous finales have done. There was also an artistry in the look of the show that was new, and even the weaker episodes looked gorgeous.And speaking of weaker episodes, the biggest disappointment was Victory of the Daleks. This could have been a decent story, and it wasn't a bad idea, but it was very poorly done. In contrast, the two-parter with the Silurians was a weak, cliched story that was really quite well done. The Silurians weren't particularly interesting the first time around, and look even sillier now, but there were some truly great moments, and oh what a shock at the end!Every other episode was brilliant in its own way, although I did find the pacing too fast at the beginning. Fortunately this improved. I would say hands down the best episode of the season (best ever?) was Vincent and the Doctor. Stunning.And of course I can't write a review without mentioning the new cast. I liked Matt Smith from the beginning, although it wasn't until fairly late in the season that he really ""clicked"" for me as the Doctor. Nothing against Matt Smith, it was my own mental barrier. Up till that time I had been enjoying watching him, but all of a sudden he ceased to be the new actor playing the Doctor and became the Doctor. And now that he has, it will make the season that much more enjoyable in the re-watching.Amy didn't win me over until the second episode, and I continued to like her better and better. You just feel a connection with her that is pretty rare even for Doctor Who.And then there's Rory, one of the greatest things about the new series. How he can add so much depth as well as so much lightness is just sheer genius. Fantastic.The return of River Song is very welcome, and promises to become even more interesting in season 6.Overall, despite one true clunker, one weak two-parter, and some pacing problems at the beginning, this was an amazing, amazing season that met and exceeded my expectations.

1338963,AMUNDUVA1VUB9,B003EV6DBM,Phil Rosenbach,"[9, 11]","Doctor Who Season 5 ReviewOnce again, this isn't specifically a review of the individual shows on this box set, or of the program itself, but more of a review as to the faults and ignorant oversights as to what it doesn't offer, compared to previous box sets from seasons 1-4.  If you need to know the specifics of this product, content, and episode by episode break down, there are plenty of web sites out there just for that. And if that is all you're looking for from this review, then I humbly suggest that you skip this and continue to read anything from elsewhere.And now for those who care for something more insightful...For starters, I payed for this, and as such, I don't want to be inundated with commercials!  After you get through all the legal stuff, and the 2|entertain and BBC logos, there are commercials for various programs on most of the discs, and for BBC America.  Personally, I feel that since I am PAYING for this program, I should be able to watch said program without having to watch any commercials.  And this shouldn't apply only to this release, but to all future releases no matter what the show or show or movie is.Getting past that initial irritation, you should know that there is one major feature, or lack thereof, and that being there is no ""Select Episode"" option, only ""Play All.""  But after some time, and I admit, by accident, I discovered that if you use the ""Select Scene"" option, you can watch individual episodes.  But for anyone to not include a ""Select Episode"" option on the main menu is either lazy or incompetent.Also, there is no 3-D trailer, and I know for a fact that one was made.  You can watch it on YouTube.  So why not include it?  The one on YouTube requires the green and red glasses, but nonetheless, they should at least make it an option for those who care to get those specs and enjoy that trailer.  And since I'm on the subject of trailers, if all that was lacking isn't enough, the ""Coming Next"" trailer at the end of each episode has been eliminated from the original broadcast.  Now to be honest, I always skipped past this, but for the purists out there, since it was part of the show then, it should be included now.  If the BBC doesn't want to do the ""Coming Next"" clip at the end of the episodes for season six, then fine, at least we won't be missing anything that didn't already air.  Just don't pull a George Lucas or Steven Spielberg by continually changing that which has already been broadcast.As for the, behind the scenes, geeks like me, there are only In Vision commentaries for select episodes.  I remember the good old days, about, oh, two years ago, when there used to be commentaries for all episodes in previous seasons, either In Vision or standard audio.  Adding insult to injury, said same commentaries for this season are in many aspects an ego boost for Moffat, and are filmed as a straight forward shot of those participating, which sort of looks like a police line up.  And even worse than that, those participating, quite frankly, look bored.  And if you didn't think it could get any worse, (hello wound, would you care for some salt?) the two parters only have a commentary for one of the two parts!  Seriously, can't you people finish what you start, or in some cases, start what you finish?  And while it's unfortunate that Matt Smith didn't participate in any of the commentaries, Karen (Amy) and (Arthur) Rory, were in the last one with the director, and that was really the only one that was enjoyable to listen to as well as watch, while they reacted to the episode.Now for the worst part.  On the technical aspect, the damn thing gets jack up during the In Vision commentaries unless the screen resolution is manually reset to a specific setting.  It was only after reading another customers' review did I learn that some players need to be manually set to a specific screen resolution in order to avoid this problem.  (1080i)  This is all due to the fact that the Blu-Ray version wasn't remastered for players outside the UK, and so, there is a chance that, even with updating your Blu-Ray player, you may not be able to enjoy everything that this box set has to offer.  Again, this is all due to laziness on behalf of those the pressed these and allowed their distribution.Finally, there is the last disc which contains the Confidentials...  They are not listed as being cut, but you can bet the tin dog that they are just that.  While the originals averaged roughly 43 minutes in length, those presented on the Blu-Ray are averaging 12 minutes!  One would think that since Blu-Ray discs hold considerably more data than DVDs, they should have been presented if not wholly, then at least more complete than these whittled down thumbnails.So in conclusion, while I profess to still be an avid fan of Doctor Who, I loath the ad infused, content diluted product, which I payed for.  The DVD set is cheaper, and has no fewer features than the Blu-ray, so I would regard that as a better buy.  Or, if all you wish to do is watch the bare bones of each episode, then purchase the individual shows through On Demand, or Amazon, or anything, and save even more money, since you won't be getting much of anything elsewhere.",3,Blu-Nay,1294185600,"01 5, 2011",2011,5218,"['Doctor', 'Who', 'Season', '5', 'ReviewOnce', 'again', ""n't"", 'specifically', 'review', 'individual', 'box', 'set',

First off, he's just too young. But, more so, he's just not The Doctor. He is a kid who is full of himself and clearly out of his league. I have watched every episode of this new season with Matt Smith desperately looking for something to like. I cannot, and have not found it. I believe that the writers are going back to the original plan in writing the story for children this time around. It's sad, because David Tennant was an excellent doctor. As was Christopher Eccelston, and all who came before him. I even liked the Peter Cushing doctor, and the Paul McGann Dr. as well. I know many fans liked neither. I feel I am a true fan. I loved William Hartnell and the so called clown Patrick Troughton. Though, to this day, Jon Pertwee is my favorite, Tom Baker second, and Chris E. third, then David Tennant. There has not been one story with Matt Smith that I have felt worthy of wanting to own.{****Spoiler Alert**** Read on at your own risk} The final episode as pointed out by another reviewer just wipes out the whole story of the Matt Smith's first season, what a cop-out. That in itself is the kookiest (for lack of a better term) choice the writers ever could have made. The whole was that Amy brings him back by remembering him makes no sense at all. I guess the main thing about science fiction that makes me love it, and always has, is the science part of it. They seem to have taken the science out of this season of Dr. Who with this particular Dr. I won't buy it, I have purchased most of every other dvd out there containing Dr. Who. I have all 4 of the prior seasons, and most of the specials, most of the dvd's of the earlier doctors as well. When the prices come down on the newer releases I will own them also. But, I doubt I would want this in my collection. Sorry, Matt. You are just not my doctor.Ralph J.

I mean, they did get progressively darker and uglier and at times downright depressing. But they had some extraordinary episodes. I'll never forget being held by the neck by the suspense of Midnight or scared to walk down the hallway of my house at night after watching &#34;Blink&#34;. Sadly, the specials (or the &#34;Let's get another year out of Tennant and Davies whether they like it or not&#34; episodes) were garbage. Aside from &#34;Waters of Mars&#34;, the Doctor did nothing but bitch and moan and whine, and I was glad to see him go. But I won't lie, his final scene was a bit heart wrenching, because the Doctor I knew and loved, despite being annoyed by his whininess in those last episodes, was leaving. But, when Matt Smith appeared for the first time in that last episode, my kind changed about him completely. I thought he was not going to live up, because DT set standards way too high. And maybe he did. But I was charmed by his suaveness, hilarity and perkiness within that short appearance, and immediately I sprung to &#34;The Eleventh Hour&#34; without hesitation.Simply put, Matt Smith is a winner. Sure, he's no David Tennant. But he doesn't try to be David Tmennat either- after all, if he tried aping the winning formula, it wouldn't be good, right? It would be sour and boring. Thankfully, Matt Smith does take a page or two from other actors books, but gives it his own spin too. He portrays The Doctor as someone who is almost always positive and thinks &#34;it can get much worse&#34;. Sure he does have a few moments where you can tell he's seen death, but he chooses not to angst and realizes that Time Lords have long lives for a reason. His catch phrases like &#34;Bow ties are cool&#34; and &#34;Geronimo!!!!!!&#34; are pure winners and are absolutely hilarious. And when he smiles, we smile. He is fun, charming, suave, persuasive, and flamboyant, which is truly refreshing.His companions are equally fun. Amelia Pond is a beautiful and fun girl who has a great sense of humour and doesn't take herself too seriously. She has a cute Scottish accent and a lot of hilarious one liners, and she helps make the episodes fun to watch. Her fiance&eacute; Rory is played by the handsome and charming Arthur Darvill, who does have to put up with Amy's constant sarcasm and sort of let's her walk all over him, but it's funny. He himself has some funny lines, like near the end of &#34;Vampires of Venice&#34;, when he uses the following to defend Amy: &#34;This way you ugly... spongebob... the only thing uglier was your-- mum...&#34;.The episodes? Admittedly this season does start rather slowly, but around episode 3, it really gets going, and when it does, it's a roller coaster. River Song returns for a couple episodes (including the Pandorica ones) and she is great to watch- sassy, full of class, and badass, with a lot of good jokes too. The weeping angels are back and this time they're everywhere. They're just as scary as they were in series 3 too. Really, I didn't not like any episodes in the season, as all of them were fun, and most were very fast paced.In short, I can't recommend this season enough. It's one of the best and the beginning of a era for The Doctor. Thank you Moffat for bringing new life to the show, and thanks to Smith for giving a fresh feel to The Doctor. Thanks to Gillan and Darvill for also providing excellent performances as the companions!

1338976,ARZ8M95ZUMY7L,B003EV6DBM,R. Hernandez,"[3, 3]","Like alot of other Doctor Who fans, I grew up during the Tom Baker years until the show was pulled after Sylvester McCoy.  When it was revived with Christopher Eccleston and the David Tennant years, I was sucked back into the Who universe once again.  Both the 9th and 10th Doctor incarnations were incredible as each had their own personality that was strong yet compassionate at the same time with a smidgen of darkness around the edges.  And so we enter into the 11th incarnation of the Doctor played excellently by newcomer Matt Smith.  As season 5 opens, the TARDIS crash lands outside of little Amelia(Amy) Pond's residence as she prays to God for someone to come to her house and get rid of a crack on her wall that allows her to hear voices from the unknown.  Little does she know that it's the sound of the universe that is collapsing and the plot line for the season.That's where the newly regenerated Doctor appears and quickly realizes that the world will end in twenty minutes unless he rises to the occasion.  This leads to several time leaps that if your not careful, could confuse you as the Doctor leaves young Amelia behind to straighten out some problems in the TARDIS and mistakenly returns some years later to find an adult Amy Pond played beautifully by Karen Gillan as his new companion.  Season 5 not only continues the crack in time storyline throughout the season but new and old enemies are brought together in the 2 part finale in ""The Pandorica Opens"" and ""The Big Bang"".  Along the way, we also run into the Daleks and another fan favorite known as the Weeping Angels in a spectacular episode.  Also in the mix, the Doctor's future bride River Song, played by Alex Kingston, is in several episodes and she hints about things about her that the Doctor might not like hearing about.  Look to see her next season for a clearer explanation.I realize that some people may not take to Matt Smith but if given a chance, you'll find him hilarious, serious and a little sinister at times.  The character of Amy Pond is a strong willed person that at times might seem annoying but her courage and cleverness makes up for her bullheadedness that makes her the polar opposite of Rose Tyler and Martha Jones and more like former companions Tegan or Donna Noble.  This is an excellent series so far and with Matt Smith as the lead, look for some more great years to come.  The series has alot of great extras like the Video Diaries of the actors, additional scenes from certain episodes that continue just a little longer and Doctor Who Confidential, outtakes and trailers.  I highly recommend this and it arrived real fast when I ordered it.  Remember, the Doctor is the same person...he just has a different face after each regeneration.

Some of the episodes in this season and last season are the worst ever.  Putting aside that ridiculous stinker ""Daleks in Manhattan"", lets take a look at this season.A Dalek Constructed cybernetic bomb, about to destroy the Earth. The Doctor and companion convince him to remember his false memories of love.  He does. And love disarms the bomb.  Gag!  So if we extrapolate, when he discovers his love is false or is rejected, we can kiss the Earth goodbye, right?Same episode, propeller driven aircraft flying in the vacuum of space. Yea, right.  That's just idiotic.Same episode. The Daleks base their entire existence on the Doctor saying a certain phrase in the vicinity of a certain object to verify that they are actually Daleks and can be reborn. Pathetic.Season finale: I think the writer watched the Bill and Ted movies a few too many times.  Yes, Doctor Who, the original Time Traveler TV series, is ripping off Bill and Ted.  Oh yea, and the Doctor is saved by - Love. OH COME ON!  We've passed pathetic and moved on to brain-dead territory.There are just so many moments like that in Season Five that this will rank as the WORST season in the reincarnation. Doctor Who is not a CHICK FLICK! Problems are not solved by emotions, discussions and, gak, love.  There have been books written on the science behind the series.  Now they can write one on the fluff, lack of originality, and atrocious writing.The opening title sequence and theme music?  Amateurish, lacking any soul.  Sounds and looks like a rookie intern project. There's better theme music on the fan websites.The series seems to be targeted at kids.  We have a clown playing the doctor, lots of pretty lights, simple plots, hollow characters, and a story line sculptured for those with attention deficit.The writers have an obvious policy. When the plot is garbage, add Daleks. If it's total garbage, add Daleks and make the Doctor jump around like a fool, hopefully distracting from the underwhelming storyline. Please kill off this Doctor.  He's obviously terrified of leaving the Earth (or the writers can't seem to come up with a decent off-Earth story) and thinks channeling Cameron from ""Ferris Bueller's Day off"" solves problems.The only reason it has two stars - at least Amy is pleasant to look at, and I love a Scots accent.I have all the seasons released to date.

1338988,AJ7SBFCIXPJM1,B003EV6DBM,"Scot Merideth Peirson ""Scot Peirson""","[3, 5]","Season Five of the reconstituted/reimaged Doctor Who was greatly anticipated, not just because of the transition from David Tennant to Matt Smith as The Doctor, but what direction Steven Moffat would take as the showrunner after--using the terminology I've used with this series--the Russell T. Davies chapter.  Smith--the youngest actor ever to play the TimeLord--brought an old-soul nature to the role.  If Tennant seemed to hearken to Tom Baker, Smith seemed to go all the way back to Patrick Troughton and William Hartnell; a little crotchety at times, but filled with the usual boundless energy and the lines flying at warp speed.The Companion to Smith's Eleventh Doctor is Karen Gillan's Amy Pond.  The immediate issue with Gillan--because of her red hair--is to immediately compare her to Catherine Tate.  Whereas Donna Noble was all mouth and ""shoulders"" (AHEM); Amy Pond is all eyes (brown and doe-eyed) and legs.  Not that she isn't mouthy, but Amy has NOTHING on Donna.  In this storyline, The Doctor first meets ""Pond"" (As he calls her sometimes) when she's seven, leaves for two minutes (his two minutes), but comes back to her 12 years later (Her 12 years), then, when she's ready to travel with him it's after a minute of his time--but two more years (And the night before she's supposed to get married) in her time (There WILL be a test on this later...).  Plus, there is the element of Amy's attraction to The Doctor, something that plays out at the end of the ""The Time Of Angels/Flesh And Stone"" two-parter.  This isn't a case of Amy having the feelings for The TimeLord that Rose Tyler or Martha Jones had...this is a Companion in heat.  Which leads to the first interesting twist in the Moffatt chapter...The first unique twist of this first part of the Moffatt chapter comes from Arthur Davrill's Rory Williams--Amy's fianc&eacute;e, who ends up being a key part of this season; putting Rory into the TARDIS--which sort of gives the storyline a feel of Jack Harkness/Gwen Cooper/Rhys Williams from Torchwood.  Moffatt takes a very different tack here by very quickly giving this Doctor his family...it's just a little bit of a shock that the fourth member of this group is Alex Kingston's River Song--but make no mistake, it's a pleasant shock.  River was introduced in Series 4--the two-parter ""Silence in The Library/Forest of The Dead""--as a woman who at some point, ends up being very important to The Doctor, but he currently keeps running into her out of order.  Kingston certainly brings a little bawdiness to the character--letting The Doctor know that he's about to run into her with the message, ""Hello, Sweetie""--but the season finale--""The Big Bang""--also alerts the viewer that there's more to her than just being a Companion (Future wife?) to The Doctor.  Suffice it to say that (For those familiar with the Whoniverse) hearing a Dalek begging for mercy from a Companion...is a little different.  This series--with River's appearances in four episodes--allows for River to become the person pointing towards the impending dangers that The Doctor, Amy and Rory face, but she also shows her affection for her man.  The last scene between Kingston and Smith in ""The Big Bang"" is a hearty and passionate moment where River really starts letting her guard down to The Doctor...and gets cut short with her next warning of impending danger.There are many high points in this season--the opener, ""The Eleventh Hour"", in which Smith establishes his take on The Doctor, and the season's storyline gets set into motion...""The Beast Below"" has the surprising and unique twist of Amy picking up on things early and stopping The Doctor from making a mistake--plus a great turn from Sophie Okonedo as ""Liz Ten""...the aforementioned ""The Time Of Angels/Flesh And Stone"", which brings back The Weeping Angels from Season 3's ""Blink"";  ""The Hungry Earth/Cold Blood"" two-parter which begins the time paradox that is part of the season's climax;... but my absolute favorite story of this season is the episode ""Vincent And The Doctor"", where the TimeLord and Amy meet up with Vincent Van Gogh after seeing something out of place in one of his paintings at Musee D' Orsay in Paris.  It's a great turn by Tony Curran as the tortured artist...who develops a little bit of a thing for Amy...but what makes this episode is an uncredited performance by Bill Nighy as a curator/expert at D'Orsay who unknowingly lets an unpopular artist during his life know that he ends up being held in higher esteem in history.  It's a touching and brilliant scene, all at once heartbreaking and uplifting.  Nighy is just great, oblivious to the person near him; Curran is heartbreaking--finding out that his art is held in such high esteem after his departure.Overall, this first part of Moffatt's chapter allows Smith to establish is old soul in a young body (""Bow ties are cool...""), Amy to evoke some element of Donna Noble (Though Donna made the point that she wasn't a shag in the TARDIS early on to The Tenth Doctor) while being the ultimate hero of the season, Davrill to become something more than Noel Clarke's Mickey Smith from the Davies chapter, and Kingston to begin to add layers--both heroic and ominous--to River.  All in all, a good beginning to the Moffatt Chapter.",5,Doctor Who Season 5--Smith Gives The Doctor Old Soul,1296000000,"01 26, 2011",2011,5279,"['Season', 'Five', 'reconstituted/reimaged', 'Doctor',

1339002,A3VQSFORKH8B7O,B003EV6DBM,Steven Hancock,"[1, 3]","The fifth season (or series) of ""Doctor Who"" presented viewers with a number of changes. Head Writer/Executive Producer Russell T. Davies and Executive Producer Julie Gardner, who had successfully brought the show back to television in 2005, stepped down from their duties. Replacing them were Steven Moffatt, Piers Wenger and Beth Willis. The new creative team brought in many things, including a new look for both the interior and exterior of the Tardis, as well as a slightly different style to the stories they would tell. But biggest of all, they introduced us to a new Doctor: Number Eleven, played by relative newcomer Matt Smith.Smith's performance as the Eleventh Doctor is fascinating to watch. It's hard to explain exactly how he plays the Doctor, but he does so with a lot of energy and talent. He's joined on his adventures by Karen Gillan as the feisty redhead Amy Pond, who provides the Doctor with a companion willing to butt heads with him on occasion. Also joining them on occasion is Amy's fiance Rory, played by Arthur Darvill, and the mysterious River Song, once again played by Alex Kingston, reprising her role from the previous regular season.Steven Moffatt, no stranger to the world of the Good Doctor, has written several stories before, including the classic ""Blink"" and the two-part adventure ""Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead."" As Head Writer for the new series, he's written six of the thirteen episodes. Five of those episodes (The premiere episode, ""The Eleventh Hour;"" the two-parter ""The Time of Angels/Flesh and Stone"" that sees the return of the creepy and sinister Weeping Angels; and the two-part finale ""The Pandorica Opens/The Big Bang,"" where the Doctor faces his greatest challenge yet) are destined to become classics! The other standout episode is ""Vincent and the Doctor,"" where the Doctor and Amy join Vincent van Gogh to fight an alien threat.The other episodes are good overall. However, there are two drawbacks to this season. The first is that the show suffers from a slight lack of cohesion. Unlike previous seasons, where all the episodes melded together well despite the many locations through time and space, this one tends to go all over the place without sticking together well. The other problem is Episode Three, ""Victory of the Daleks."" Although the episode is good overall, the unwelcome return of the Doctor's greatest enemy mars the whole endeavor, and  shows that the Daleks are quickly becoming stale.However, other than these problems, the new season of ""Doctor Who"" is strong overall, and bodes well for the show's future. The Blu-ray release is good as well, with terrific picture and sound, and a good amount of extras. Fans will definitely find this season of the show worth owning.Program/Blu-ray Grade: B+",4,"""The Pandorica Will Open.

No actor could ever be too young to play the Doctor since the regeneration could take on any age or visage of the Doctor's race- the Timelords. Doctor Who has been silly sometimes let's face facts. But some of the greatest shows are the ones where in spite of lame sets, the actors who play all the characters-the Doctor included, just work well together. Especially in the case of Patrick and Wendy and Frazer. Those three were incredible together. I think that Rory and Amy and the Matt reached similar moments this last season. Rory like Jamie is totally out of his element, Amy like Wendy seems to be on the same wavelength as the Doctor. Some fun things happen. I really enjoyed most of the episodes.

I didn't expect much going in, as David Tennant was a fine Doctor (though his ending annoyed me to no end), but Smith takes his place with a fun charismatic performance. From the moment he shows up, he gives a sense of other worldness. His approach with young Amy Pond is delightful in that he's playing child psychiatry to keep her brave wonderfully.The season stands out to me as being one of the better ones in recent memory. We have the return of the Angels, which actually managed to make them even creepier. The running story line was interesting, and made me try to piece together not only what was going on, but how it could possibly end.My only complaints are that the collection did not include the Christmas Special, which was placed in series 6 instead.

The excessive regard for royalty is one thing, but they also sneak in a lot of jabs against Victorian values, and they employ subliminal Luciferian images.  For instance, in the first episode of this season, when Amy questions whether she should trust the doctor, he offers her an apple, then angelic music plays in the background, and a wedge of light moves from the left side of the screen behind the doctor and through him into Amy.

If not, you're missing out because Matt Smith is wonderful and I can't imagine anyone else as the Eleventh Doctor. The companion, Amy Pond, may just be crazy but in the best of ways.

The Dcotor is nothing if not a man of his word, however, and things step off rather well as the two of them find out many things - including what frozen fish and custard taste like.This season seems a bit odd, and not just because of the change-up. It is also because of the housecleaning Who is enduring, because the Dr. annd the staffing are new.

While Matt Smith is fine as the Doctor and brings his own quirky interpretation to the role, the writing for the first two episodes was, to be charitable, weak (in fact the second episode borrowed an idea from the pilot episode of ""Star Trek: The next Generation"" although to be fair ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" ""borrowed"" the idea of the Borg so turn about seems to be fair play here.). I was surprised as writer Steven Moffatt had written the best episodes of the previous seasons in my opinion. Luckily, things picked up by the third episode set in World War Two where PM Winston Churchill unveils his own secret weapon to take out the Nazi's with unintended consquences and results.The transfer here looks better than any of the previous episodes on either DVD or Blu-ray. The first four series were shot on regular video and blacks looked more like very dark blues. The colors are quite good here. The fifth season looks quite nice in its high def premiere. If you've purchased the DVD I can't comment on the video quality as I haven't seen it.A couple of minor complaints--the two part episode involving the Weeping Angels are NOT on the same disc (and should be)and while audio is an improvement over some of the previous sets, dialogue is occasionally overwhelmed by the music IF you choose to listen to the 5.1 mix in stereo (the obvious solution would be to listen to it in 5.1 but some folks won't do that hence the warning).The extras are, as always, quite generous. ""The Eleventh Hour"", ""Victory of the Daleks"", ""The Time of Angels"", ""The Vampires of Venice"", ""Cold Blood"" and ""The Big Bang"" all feature pip commentary tracks. We get deleted scenes, outtakes, ""Doctor Who Confidential"", video diaries and ""Monster Files"" for various creatures. There are three collectable postcards included in the set as well. The booklet that was in previous editions has been eliminated replaced by credits on the cardboard fold out cover. I dislike this packaging compared to the previous ones but it isn't horrible.

There's no pushing and it comes across as natural at all times. He is especially strong in showing the doctor's lighthearted madness.  For many this might make him the best performer out of the three and therefore the best doctor; however, he lacks vulnerability in his approach. With the two previous actors you could often see the despair, lonliness and fear that the doctor holds inside- for them the madness the doctor portrayed was often an attempt to hide these vulnerabilities.  Where as Matt Smith's doctor seems to just be somewhat mad...simply because he is mad.  And to his credit Smith portrays this very well actually, but it's not as interesting because it was the doctor's vulnerability that made him so easy to relate to even though he is an alien time lord from outer space that travels in a 1960's police box.  There are so many scenes where Smith chooses not to show any fear in the face of danger, while Tennant and Eccleston often did.  If the doctor isn't scared about what's about to happen then why should the audience care what's going to happen?  I found myself drifting in my attention sometimes.  The main problem I see is the writing in seasons 5 & 6 is significantly less interesting than it was during Tennant's reign as the doctor, which means Matt Smith has less rich material to work with. (Not always- ""The God Complex"" in season 6 for instance is a well written episode). Season 6 is better than Season 5 but in general I feel they are both just shadows of previous seasons.  The doctor is a very different character than he was before.  All of a sudden, ""The doctor lies"" all the time.  So what is he now, House M.D.??  The previous doctors didn't like lying at all and the few times he did lie about a serious issue it bothered him. When he lied and told Martha (season 3 motorway episode) that Gallifrey still existed he was struggling with his guilt the entire episode and said so- until the end of the episode where he admited the lie and told her the truth.  It doesn't fit dr. who and it just makes him less likeable.  This doctor Who doesn't seem like he has a different face, but rather that it's an entirely different character and show altogether.",3,Comparing The Doctors,1343433600,"07 28, 2012",2012,2788,"['doctor', 'something', 'different', 'table', 'not', 'easy', 'compare', 'them.9th', 'doctor', 'Christopher', 'Eccleston', 'was', 'strong', 'showing', 'darkness', 'last', 'time', 'lords', 'when', 'came', 'showing', 'light', 'heartedness', 'would', 'sometimes', 'be', 'caught', 'forcing', 'facial', 'expressions.10th', 'doctor', 'David', 'Tennant', 'was', 'strong', 'showing', 'vulnerability', 'sadness', 'lonliness', 'was', 'palpable', 'audience', 'again', 'was', 'sometimes', 'forcing', 'facial', 'expressions', 'scenes', 'where', 'was', 'showing', 'intense', 'shock', 'anger.11th', 'doctor', 'Matt', 'Smith', 'not', 'force', 'acting', 'pushing', 'natural', 'times', 'especially', 'strong', 'showing', 'doctor', 'lighthearted', 'madness', 'many', 'might', 'make', 'best', 'performer', 'three', 'therefore', 'best', 'doctor', 'however', 'vulnerability', 'approach', 'two', 'previous', 'actors', 'could', 'often', 'see', 'despair', 'lonliness', 'fear', 'doctor', 'inside-', 'madness', 'doctor', 'portrayed', 'was', 'often', 'attempt', 'hide', 'vulnerabilities', 'Where', 'Matt', 'Smith', 'doctor', 'just', 'be', 'somewhat', 'mad', 'simply', 'mad', 'credit', 'Smith', 'very', 'well', 'actually', 'not', 'interesting', 'was', 'doctor', 'vulnerability', 'made', 'so', 'easy', 'relate', 'even', 'alien', 'time', 'lord', 'outer', 'space', '1960', 'police', 'box', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'scenes', 'where', 'Smith', 'not', 'show', 'fear', 'face', 'danger', 'Tennant', 'Eccleston', 'often', 'did', 'doctor', ""n't"", 'scared', 'what', 'about', 'happen', 'then', 'why', 'should', 'audience', 'care', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'found', 'drifting', 'attention', 'sometimes', 'main', 'problem', 'see', 'writing', 'seasons', '5', '6', 'significantly', 'less', 'interesting', 'was', 'Tennant', 'reign', 'doctor', 'Matt', 'Smith', 'less', 'rich', 'material', 'work', 'Not', 'always-', 'God', 'Complex', 'season', '6', 'instance', 'well', 'written', 'episode', 'Season', '6', 'better', 'Season', '5', 'general', 'feel', 'are', 'just', 'shadows', 'previous', 'seasons', 'doctor', 'very', 'different', 'character', 'was', 'sudden', 'doctor', 'time', 'what', 'now', 'House', 'M.D.', 'previous', 'doctors', 'did', ""n't"", 'lying', 'few', 'times', 'did', 'lie', 'serious', 'issue', 'bothered', 'When', 'lied', 'told', 'Martha', 'season', '3', 'motorway', 'episode', 'Gallifrey', 'still', 'existed', 'was', 'struggling', 'guilt', 'entire', 'episode', 'said', 'so-', 'end', 'episode', 'where', 'admited', 'lie', 'told', 'truth', ""n't"", 'fit', 'dr.', 'who', 'just', 'less', 'likeable', 'doctor', 'Who', ""n't"", 'seem', 'different', 'face', 'rather', 'entirely', 'different', 'character', 'show', 'altogether']",N/A

Thank goodness BBCAmerica isn't so limited in their choices!!!! I and other longtime and new Dr. Who fans would be missing the fabulous gift of Matt Smith's 11th Dr. Who's delightful, bubbling over personality! What a loss that would be!Via Matt Smith's portrayal, the 11th Doctor is playful, enthusiastic, full of passion for life, his friends, new discoveries and just brightly and boldly lights up the screen! He's also very ferocious and protective when the role calls for those qualities and tender and gentle at other times. It's awesome and uplifting and continues to get better!There are the episodes that are dark and foreboding and he's depressed and sullen due to certain tragic outcomes, these are clearly communicated in Matt Smith's wonderful performance.With Stephen Moffat at the helm, the storytelling of Dr. Who's adventures is going in unique and very entertaining directions! The writing overall is deep, imaginative and has great theme and character patterns follow-through from episode to episode and season to season. The time travel stories are very well done and have at times entertainingly made my brain crossed in trying to figure them out.I hope Matt Smith and Stephen Moffat continue on successfully for many years! It's a show I always look forward to watching and overall doesn't disappoint.",5,Matt Smith you ROCK as the 11th Doctor Who!!!

1339031,A354YKPKIPALX4,B003EV6DBM,"Yvonne Jocks ""also writing as Evelyn Vaughn""","[2, 3]","First: Amazon.com's ""Watch it Now"" downloads? I love 'em. With iTunes, I have to wait for a download to finish before I can start watching a new show, but not with Amazon. And that's how I watched the entirety of Season 5 of Dr. Who.Second: This season of Dr. Who was my first, and I do believe it's the closest I've come to seeing a perfect season of television. Considering what a TV addict I am--Buffy, Veronica Mars--that's saying a lot! I'm an American, but Dr. Who shows how to avoid so many pitfalls currently plaguing network television:* The fairy-tale start and the crazy introduction of the Eleventh Doctor create the exact right suspension of disbelief. Network shows, too often, either take things so seriously that the audience (also serious) questions everything, or is so tongue-in-cheek that it doesn't seem at all real. Not Dr. Who! Everyone sells the situation, even the ""terror"" of the Daleks, but there's enough humor that the audience plays along, which is as it should be. Heartbreak and humor! It's positively Whedonesque... or, more likely, Joss Whedon has Whovian elements to his work. Creativity may be faily timey-wimey itself.* The romance--oh, the romance! I like a good (preferrably happy!) romantic subplot to my television, which is why I'd avoided Who before now--as I understood it, the rare romance was generally unrequited? And yet on American television, shows like Bones tempt the audience with will they/won't they situations while all the time fleeing an imaginary ""Moonlighting Curse."" This season of Dr. Who blew that away. The Amy/Rory romance. The Doctor/River romance. They weren't allowed to overwhelm the story (duh), but they were completely satisfying.* The artistic unity. By the final two episodes, I was savoring the callbacks to previous episodes and how beautifully everything came back to form a perfect circle. No episode or secondary character had been wasted--which means Nothing Was Forgotten. Too often, American television seems to lose some of its continuity. This season of Dr. Who was absolute continuity. AND--they resolved everything. On an American network, the series would have ended with the 2nd to the last episode and the tragic cliff-hanger, as if audiences can't be expected to tune back in unless they're held hostage by a need to know. Dr. Who gave us an ending so satisfying that I'll be a repeat customer. What a concept?Finally--the time travel. I can take or leave the space aliens, but I do love a good time travel. As a huge fan of Audrey Niffeneggar's The Time Traveler's Wife, I loved how it flavored this season of Dr. Who, from the out-of-sync romance of River Song to the redheaded girl waiting for her time traveling friend to return. I've loved time travel television from Voyagers! to Journeyman, and this season of Dr. Who in particular has shot to the top of my list.Watch it.",5,Perfect Time Travel TV -- American Shows Take Note!,1306022400,"05 22, 2011",2011,2869,"['First', 'Amazon.com', 'Watch', 'Now', 'downloads', 'love', 'iTunes', 'have', 'wait', 'download', 'finish', 'can', 'start', 'watching', 'new', 'show', 'not', 'Amazon', 'how', 'watched', 'entirety', 'Season', '5', 'Dr.', 'Who.Second', 'season', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'was', 'first', 'do', 'believe', 'closest', ""'ve"", 'come', 'seeing', 'perfect', 'season', 'television', 'Considering', 'what', 'TV', 'addict', 'am', 'Buffy', 'Veronica', 'Mars', 'saying', 'lot', ""'m"", 'American', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'how', 'avoid', 'so', 'many', 'pitfalls', 'currently', 'plaguing', 'network', 'television', '*', 'fairy-tale', 'start', 'crazy', 'introduction', 'Eleventh', 'Doctor', 'create', 'exact', 'right', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'Network', 'shows', 'too', 'often', 'either', 'take', 'things', 'so', 'seriously', 'audience', 'also', 'serious', 'questions', 'everything', 'so', 'tongue-in-cheek', ""n't"", 'seem', 'real', 'Not', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'Everyone', 'situation', 'even', 'terror', 'Daleks', 'enough', 'humor', 'audience', 'along', 'should', 'be', 'Heartbreak', 'humor', 'positively', 'Whedonesque', 'more', 'likely', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'Whovian', 'elements', 'work', 'Creativity', 'may', 'be', 'faily', 'timey-wimey', '*', 'romance', 'oh', 'romance', 'good', 'preferrably', 'happy', 'romantic', 'subplot', 'television', 'why', ""'d"", 'avoided', 'Who', 'before', 'now', 'understood', 'rare', 'romance', 'was', 'generally', 'unrequited', 'yet', 'American', 'television', 'Bones', 'tempt', 'audience', 'will', 'they/wo', ""n't"", 'situations', 'time', 'fleeing', 'imaginary', 'Moonlighting', 'Curse', 'season', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'blew', 'away', 'Amy/Rory', 'romance', 'Doctor/River', 'romance', 'were', ""n't"", 'allowed', 'overwhelm', 'story', 'duh', 'were', 'completely', 'satisfying', '*', 'artistic', 'unity', 'final', 'two', 'episodes', 'was', 'savoring', 'callbacks', 'previous', 'episodes', 'how', 'beautifully', 'everything', 'came', 'back', 'form', 'perfect', 'circle', 'episode', 'secondary', 'character', 'had', 'been', 'wasted', 'Nothing', 'Was', 'Forgotten', 'Too', 'often', 'American', 'television', 'lose', 'continuity', 'season', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'was', 'absolute', 'continuity', 'resolved', 'everything', 'American', 'network', 'series', 'would', 'have', 'ended', '2nd', 'last', 'episode', 'tragic', 'cliff-hanger', 'audiences', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'expected', 'tune', 'back', ""'re"", 'held', 'hostage', 'need', 'know', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'gave', 'ending', 'so', 'satisfying', ""'ll"", 'be', 'repeat', 'customer', 'What', 'concept', 'Finally', 'time', 'travel', 'can', 'take', 'leave', 'space', 'do', 'love', 'good', 'time', 'travel', 'huge', 'fan', 'Audrey', 'Niffeneggar', 'Time', 'Traveler', 'Wife', 'loved', 'how', 'flavored', 'season', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'out-of-sync', 'romance', 'River', 'Song', 'redheaded', 'girl', 'waiting', 'time', 'traveling', 'friend', 'return', ""'ve"", 'loved', 'time', 'travel', 'television', 'Voyagers', 'Journeyman', 'season', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'particular', 'shot', 'top', 'list.Watch']",N/A
