Saw the original program on PBS so was really looking forward to this.  Definitely wasn't disappointed.  Great to see Hugh & friends (CBB) enjoying themselves so much.  Recently (10/26) saw them in concert & was thrilled.  This DVD brings back wonderful memories.,5,Hugh & CBB excells,1384992000,"11 21, 2013",2013,349,"['was', 'had', 'hoped', 'more', 'Great', 'music', 'terrific', 'interview', 'Hugh', 'Saw', 'original', 'program', 'PBS', 'so', 'was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'Definitely', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'Great', 'see', 'Hugh', 'friends', 'CBB', 'enjoying', 'so', 'much', 'Recently', '10/26', 'saw', 'concert', 'was', 'thrilled', 'DVD', 'back', 'wonderful', 'memories']",N/A

He creates an energy and a synergy with the crowd that was not captured well in the DVD and/or Blu-ray! Maybe the Queenmary was not the best place for the concert, don't know! So, if you have the opportunity to see him playing live, I can guarantee you will have much more fun!

1668801,ASEBX8TBYWQWA,B00EUEWQVI,"Steven I. Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[0, 0]","British-born Hugh Laurie is best known in the US as an actor for his eight years playing a doctor on the TV comedy series ""House"" According to Wikipedia, ""He has been listed in the 2011 Guinness Book of World Records as the most watched leading man on television and is one of the highest-paid actors in a television drama, earning 250,000 ($409,000) per episode"" for the series. His career started in England as half of the comic team Fry & Laurie (with Stephen Fry- whose BBC travelogues only show up in the US on BBC America). But Laurie ventured into music and released two albums of New Orleans - style blues and pop with his band, The Copper Bottom Band.  There was a PBS special about New Orleans music and now this Blue-ray of a performance he gave on the Queen Mary (no longer sailing the ocean but now a hotel moored in Huntington Beach, California).As the 106-minute performance began, I felt that Laurie's talent was ""just okay"" - he's not a great vocalist and an okay pianist - and his ego became annoying to me. He talks about the great musicians in the band (who, honestly, were the reason I liked the performance as it progressed) but didn't bother to name them at the outset. Like a few other British musicians (pianist Jon Cleary comes first to my mind) Laurie just loves the piano music of NOLA legend Professor Longhair as well as the blues of Ray Charles, and that shows throughout the evening. If you look at the audience on the QM you will realize that they are here to see ""Dr. House"" perform and, if they learn about some great music through that experience, the show will have served its purpose. The same goes with the DVD or BD.  There's nothing on the cover to tell the buyer they are going to be introduced to some great songwriters that they never heard of.The DVD/BD comes with a bonus interview (20 minutes) in which a female interviewer (who does not identify herself) mentions that the show aired on PBS and asks about his music. Laurie comes across (at least to me) as ""flip"" and sardonic, almost like his ""House"" character. Laurie fans will appreciate the bonus, though it didn't add much info for me.Unlike the previous reviews here, I can't give this five stars. It's all subjective but - again - I found Laurie's ""celebrity"" attitude a bit to overpowering. (Look at me, I can act AND play the piano). It was the band that really provided the reason to watch this, in my opinion.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",4,"BD review -""House"" star plays and sings New Orleans music - he's okay, but the band is the reason to watch this (PBS special).",1386460800,"12 8, 2013",2013,2509,"['British-born', 'Hugh', 'Laurie', 'best', 'known', 'US', 'actor', 'eight', 'years', 'playing', 'doctor', 'TV', 'comedy', 'series', 'House', 'According', 'Wikipedia', 'been', 'listed', '2011', 'Guinness', 'Book', 'World', 'Records', 'most', 'watched', 'leading', 'man', 'television', 'one', 'highest-paid', 'actors', 'television', 'drama', 'earning', '250,000', '409,000', 'episode', 'series', 'career', 'started', 'England', 'half', 'comic', 'team', 'Fry', 'Laurie', 'Stephen', 'Fry-', 'BBC', 'only', 'show', 'up', 'US', 'BBC', 'America', 'Laurie', 'ventured', 'music', 'released', 'two', 'albums', 'New', 'Orleans', 'style', 'blues', 'pop', 'band', 'Copper', 'Bottom', 'Band', 'was', 'PBS', 'special', 'New', 'Orleans', 'music', 'now', 'Blue-ray', 'performance', 'gave', 'Queen', 'Mary', 'no', 'longer', 'sailing', 'ocean', 'now', 'hotel', 'moored', 'Huntington', 'Beach', 'California', '.As', '106-minute', 'performance', 'began', 'felt', 'Laurie', 'talent', 'was', 'just', 'okay', 'not', 'great', 'vocalist', 'okay', 'pianist', 'ego', 'became', 'annoying', 'great', 'musicians', 'band', 'who', 'honestly', 'were', 'reason', 'liked', 'performance', 'progressed', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'name', 'outset', 'few', 'other', 'British', 'musicians', 'pianist', 'Jon', 'Cleary', 'first', 'mind', 'Laurie', 'just', 'piano', 'music', 'NOLA', 'legend', 'Professor', 'Longhair', 'as', 'well', 'blues', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'evening', 'look', 'audience', 'QM', 'will', 'realize', 'are', 'here', 'see', 'Dr.', 'House', 'perform', 'learn', 'great', 'music', 'experience', 'show', 'will', 'have', 'served', 'purpose', 'same', 'DVD', 'BD', 'nothing', 'cover', 'tell', 'buyer', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'introduced', 'great', 'songwriters', 'never', 'heard', 'DVD/BD', 'bonus', 'interview', '20', 'minutes', 'female', 'interviewer', 'who', 'not', 'identify', 'mentions', 'show', 'aired', 'PBS', 'music', 'Laurie', 'least', 'flip', 'sardonic', 'almost', 'House', 'character', 'Laurie', 'fans', 'will', 'appreciate', 'bonus', 'did', ""n't"", 'add', 'much', 'info', 'previous', 'reviews', 'here', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'subjective', 'again', 'found', 'Laurie', 'celebrity', 'attitude', 'bit', 'overpowering', 'Look', 'can', 'act', 'play', 'piano', 'was', 'band', 'really', 'provided', 'reason', 'watch', 'opinion.I', 'hope', 'found', 'review', 'informative', 'helpful.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",N/A
