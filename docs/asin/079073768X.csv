106418,A1PASRZ81DY9C,079073768X,Austin Somlo,"[2, 2]","Viewed: 8/13Rate: 108/13: Chalk Mr. Wonderful as one of the best Matt Dillon movies. The way he performed his role is spectacularly good. Annabella Sciorra, who lights up the room in every scene she appears in, matches him minute for minute. They are both excellent when together, and they are both excellent when not together. There is a very good chemistry between the two. Mary-Louise Parker and William Hurt throw in their great supporting hands to keep the story lively and refreshing. The writing by Amy Schor and Vicki Polon is the chief reason why the movie moves very well with a lot of twists and turns in the plot. While watching Mr. Wonderful, I feel energized and look forward what will happen the next scene. Directed by Anthony Minghella, The English Patient, a film I've seen three times already, feels artificial and detached whereas Mr. Wonderful is real and engaging. All in all, do I think that Mr. Wonderful is a `10' picture? Yes, I do.",5,"Great, Enjoyable Picture.

You realize from nearly the beginning, despite Matt's woodeness, that Gus and Lee never sbould have split. When she left, Gus hoped she'd come back and Lee thought he'd have called. Nonetheless, while he's trying to fix her up so he can stop paying alimony and put up his share to buy the old neighborhood bowling alley, Rita, Gus' new girl; Dominic; Lee's new guy; Gus' friends and family all realize that Gus & Lee still care about each other and ultimately are still in love. Despite William Hurt's professore' performance you knew he was a heel and despite D'Onofrio being the really sweet pharmacist he is, you know that Gus & Lee only argue because of the passion they don't want to unleash due to the hurt they felt, still feel. They've known each other since childhood, for God's sake! I don't know if you have to be Italian or Catholic to get this movie, but it might help.
