It's about a young and brilliant girl consumed in a Mexican family where her mother guilts her everyday of her life, and takes out her own pain on her daughter, guilting her daughter about her imperfections.The daughter remains strong and learns through working with her sister how difficult life can be without an education, and strives to get into a good college, despite the fact that her parents only want her to get married right now and start having babies. And that that is the ONLY thing that matters. Women do not have thoughts or minds, they are only for one thing. Much of the family learns from the youngest daughter what is means to be a real woman, that you are worth so much more than just being a wife and a mother at age eighteen, and it's a beautiful, touching story about real women, not the super-model looking women you see on TV all the time.

It's a leisurely paced film and makes many good points about the stifling effects parents can have when they refuse to see the potential in their own children, and about the need for children to sometimes ignore the guilt they feel when they defy their parents in order to meet that potential.The young lady who stars does a mostly fine job with the role, but I never felt she was completely invested in what her family thought in the first place, so didn't fully appreciate the conflicts she was supposed to be having with herself over deserting them.The scene in which the group of female dress-shop workers strip down to compare cellulite and then proceed to work in the semi-nude is hilarious, and one of the film's highlights.Thoroughly enjoyable.Grade: B",4,A Well-Done Coming of Age Film,1077062400,"02 18, 2004",2004,1100,"['saw', 'movie', 'same', 'weekend', 'watched', 'quot', 'Bend', 'Beckham', 'quot', 'two', 'movies', 'are', 'very', 'similar', 'theme', 'quot', 'Real', 'Women', 'quot', 'somewhat', 'darker', 'not', 'much', 'little', 'more', 'seriously', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'girl', 'coming', 'terms', 'family', 'working-class', 'L.A', 'leisurely', 'paced', 'film', 'many', 'good', 'points', 'stifling', 'effects', 'parents', 'can', 'have', 'when', 'refuse', 'see', 'potential', 'own', 'children', 'need', 'children', 'sometimes', 'ignore', 'guilt', 'feel', 'when', 'defy', 'parents', 'order', 'meet', 'potential.The', 'young', 'lady', 'who', 'mostly', 'fine', 'job', 'role', 'never', 'felt', 'was', 'completely', 'invested', 'what', 'family', 'thought', 'first', 'place', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'fully', 'appreciate', 'conflicts', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'having', 'deserting', 'them.The', 'scene', 'group', 'female', 'dress-shop', 'workers', 'strip', 'down', 'compare', 'cellulite', 'then', 'proceed', 'work', 'semi-nude', 'hilarious', 'one', 'film', 'highlights.Thoroughly', 'enjoyable.Grade', 'B']",N/A

609291,A1ERZIZ48CBCSB,B00005JLXZ,Charismatic Creature,"[17, 49]","As a full figured woman myself, I badly wanted to like this indie film. But it's shallow and full of cliches and very underwritten, with many unrealistic events and situations that seem artificial.America Ferrara plays the heroine Ana, who is only slightly overweight by normal people standards but of course HUGELY FAT by the standards of Hollywood and the media. In most parts of the world and throughout most of human history (until the last 40 years or so), she would have been considered a beautiful, sexy, curvaceous fertility symbol. Now, sadly, any young woman who looks like Ana is considered obese. It is very hard to believe that Ana is really as confident as she comes on -- considering her weight a kinda of ""f__k you"" to the larger society -- without a drop of insecurity or pain. The movie does not explore this duality of liking yourself and still feeling bad that your physical appearance is scorned.Oddly enough, Hispanic culture is one where fuller figured women are traditionally more accepted than in mainstream Anglo culture. So the filmakers choose an odd cultural setting for their story. Also, Ana gets the most flack from her overweight mom....she is totally accepted by her skinny white boyfriend from Beverly Hills. Huh? This doesn't seem real to me in the slightest. Not that mom's don't nag you about your weight, but in the long run, a mom -- especially one struggling with her own weight -- is more likely to be sympathetic to your problem. And the harsh reality is that boys, especially teenagers from a wealthy enclave, are likely to be the cruelest critics of all. We are never shown any problems Ana has encounted going to high school in Beverly Hills, surrounded by rich super-skinny Anglo chicks. Isn't she teased and made fun of there? We aren't given a hint.By the way, is it policy in L.A. for high achieving students from inner city neighborhoods to be pulled from their local schools and sent to snotty Beverly Hills? I don't live there so I don't know. All I can say is they don't do it in my community, and with good reason -- why would you deprive local schools of their ONLY good students? and leave them with only underachievers, thus pulling down their overall standards and demoralizing the remaining students.Another shortfall in the movie is Ana's job in her sister's dressmaking business. It's set up kinda like it's a sweatshop, but it's not really -- she works for her kind, lovable sister alongside her mom and some other women. There is no exploitative ""overboss"" and when a couple women quit, there is seeming no one to replace them. Huh? No lines of unemployed immigrants waiting for low paying jobs? This is a sweatshop fantasy conjured by filmakers who have never been inside a real sweatshop. Also, I couldn't help but think since they are making $600 dress for $18, why don't they just go into business for themselves with a custom dressmaking business? Maybe making dresses for full figured gals? (They are only sewing teeny tiny dresses for rich women.)There are other gaffs -- Ana only starts thinking about college (and getting pushed by her teacher -- AFTER graduation. Doesn't anyone who ever went to college know that students start apply spring semester of senior year (or earlier!)? You don't typically get a full scholarship in late August, just a week or so before school starts. And why Colombia in New York, so far from her closeknit family? California has one of the finest and most affordable public university systems in the country, plus many excellent private colleges, some right in L.A. Ana doesn't seem to even explore the many choices available to her, including part-time schooling, community college etc. The Colombia scholarship just falls out of the sky, like a duex ex machina.Another real credibility stretcher is the idea that Ana has waited until after high school graduation to even experiment with dating or sex. Come on people, what century is this? (...) There is nothing to suggest that Ana is sheltered or even very religious.America Ferrera is a charming young actress. But sadly, unless she loses about 65 pounds, her career will be very limited, maybe a few chubby girlfriend parts at most. There is almost no place on the silver screen for a full figured woman.""Real Women"" is a disappointment from every angle. I truly wish this could have been better.

Well, suds can wait rather than make the wife irate, so I watched REAL WOMEN HAVE CURVES.  I was pleasantly--but not enthusiastically--surprised.The story of this film has been rehashed and recycled countless times:  an extended immigrant family, set in its ways, pitted against a determined youngster determined to set out on his (in this case, her) own.  Modified, the conflict centers around a proud, strong-headed mother and her equally proud, strong-headed daughter; Carmen (Lupe Ontiveros) wants her younger daughter to stay at home and help make ends meet by working in the family's East LA dress shop--Ana (America Ferrero) wishes to live her own life, which includes attending college in New York.  Of course, we all know how the story will pan out, yet the journey to Ana's destiny is interesting and at times entertaining.This is a coming of age story featuring an independent, overweight young woman who is both comfortable and at peace with her appearance--hopefully an inspiration to women everywhere frantically starving themselves to drop ten dress sizes before their next high school reunion or blind date.  And &quot;real&quot; women do have curves, as evidenced by Ana and her rather healthy coworkers stripping to their underwear on a steamy, sticky day in the dress shop.  The sight of this hastened my beer run, but it also was quite liberating.  The next day, all of us potbellied guys stripped to our boxers over at the freight dock.  I just now made bail.--D.

The women in the story work hard to make a living and the brat main character never misses a chance to provide them with a snide remark, showing off the smarts that she thinks that she has.

Hopefully, she will find roles that allow her to develop her obvious potential. The scenes of East L.A. are shot beautifully and the neighborhood comes alive and looks inviting.Unfortunately despite the talents of the film's cast, the execution of the movie doesn't follow through on it's promise. Characters are underwritten or rendered too simplistically. I also found the plot and story to be too predictable. For instance, the audience realizes what Carmen's ""condition"" is immediately and way before the character knows it herself. Also a scene in the factory where the female workers disrobe should ring truer than it does. Instead it seems too contrived.I didn't hate this film but I wanted to like it a lot more than I did. While it was good to see a Latino cast in non-stereotypical roles, the actors deserved better. The writing and acting is often leaden and the film while amusing at times is often preachy and will remind some viewers of the Afterschool Specials that ABC used to broadcast years ago.I wouldn't discourage anyone from seeing this film.

She lives in the heavily Latino community of East Los Angeles. She has just graduated from a prestigious Beverley Hills high school and wishes to attend college.  She is a very smart woman, but her family; still clinging to old traditions, want Ana to stay home and provide for the family by working in her older sister's struggling sewing factory (which in actuality is more of a sweatshop, as Ana kindly points out).  Though Ana's teacher (George Lopez) tries to convince her parents to let Ana go, they say that they are a family and will not be separated.""Real Women Have Curves"" is a funny and refreshing film.  It has several storylines that work together to convey the film's core message, accept yourself for who you are and to follow your dreams!  The film's main focus is, well, I can't really say.  Let's just say it is evenly split between Ana's conflict with her mother, Carmen (Lupe Ontiveros), who expects her daughter to marry and have children, education means nothing to her.  She also hates the fact that her daughter is overweight and is constantly calling her ""fatty"" and demeaning Ana in other harsh ways.  The film also focuses on Ana's struggle to choose between college or family, the nervous excitement she feels from her first boyfriend, the admiration she soon finds herself feeling towards the women who work so dedicatedly at the sewing shop, and, of course, her struggle to accept herself, curves and all.""Real Women Have Curves"" is a funny, refreshing, and meaningful film.  It boasts a witty script filled with delightfully funny and diverse characters that bring the story to life.  I admire how the film reinforces the belief that you don't have to be skinny to be happy or successful.  The reoccurring theme, to accept your body, is one not often seen in Hollywood films nowadays.  It was great to finally see it done.

So, I decided to rent the movie and give it a chance.  I almost didn't, all because of the title.  Real Women Have Curves?  I'm a guy and while I do enjoy ""chick flicks"", the title of this one suggests more estrogen than ""The Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood"".  But I gave it a try anyway.I'm glad that I did.  This is actually a good movie.  The movie deals with Ana.  Ana lives in a Mexican-American family and she is just about to graduate from high school.  She is a very bright girl, but her family has no money to send her to college.  Her mother forces her to work in the family factory (making $18 dresses that will sell for $600).  Her mother calls her a fatty.  Ana's English teacher is working to get her accepted to Columbia University, but her mother is against this (""it will tear the family apart"").  The movie focuses mostly on Ana's family relationships and with the dress factory.  The other focus of the movie is on Ana's brief relationship with a guy, but that seems only to show Ana maturing about herself and her weight.The one scene that sticks out as an image of feminine empowerment/classic chick flick is one in the factory where the women strip down to their undergarments and compare stretch marks from their fat and their cellulite.  The scene is played for laughs (and gets some, I suppose), but other than this one scene, the movie is really for everyone and not just for women.",4,"forget about the title, this is a good movie",1053388800,"05 20, 2003",2003,1516,"['ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'where', 'heard', 'movie', 'can', 'remember', 'heard', 'good', 'things', 'So', 'decided', 'rent', 'movie', 'give', 'chance', 'almost', 'did', ""n't"", 'title', 'Real', 'Women', 'Have', 'Curves', ""'m"", 'guy', 'do', 'enjoy', 'chick', 'flicks', 'title', 'one', 'more', 'estrogen', 'Divine', 'Secrets', 'Ya', 'Ya', 'Sisterhood', 'gave', 'try', 'anyway.I', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'actually', 'good', 'movie', 'movie', 'deals', 'Ana', 'Ana', 'Mexican-American', 'family', 'just', 'about', 'graduate', 'high', 'school', 'very', 'bright', 'girl', 'family', 'money', 'send', 'college', 'mother', 'work', 'family', 'factory', 'making', '18', 'dresses', 'will', 'sell', '600', 'mother', 'fatty', 'Ana', 'English', 'teacher', 'working', 'get', 'accepted', 'Columbia', 'University', 'mother', 'will', 'tear', 'family', 'apart', 'movie', 'mostly', 'Ana', 'family', 'relationships', 'dress', 'factory', 'other', 'focus', 'movie', 'Ana', 'brief', 'relationship', 'guy', 'only', 'show', 'Ana', 'maturing', 'herself', 'weight.The', 'one', 'scene', 'out', 'image', 'feminine', 'empowerment/classic', 'chick', 'flick', 'one', 'factory', 'where', 'women', 'strip', 'undergarments', 'compare', 'stretch', 'marks', 'fat', 'cellulite', 'scene', 'played', 'laughs', 'suppose', 'other', 'one', 'scene', 'movie', 'really', 'everyone', 'not', 'just', 'women']",N/A

In all cases, we are presented with a female protagonist endeavoring to break traditional cultural bonds being imposed by an older generation - father, mother, or grandparent.In REAL WOMEN HAVE CURVES, Ana (America Ferrera) has just graduated from a Beverly Hills high school, to which she buses every day from her family's home in east central Los Angeles. Not only is Ana a gifted student, but she's won a scholarship to Columbia University. However, her Latino parents, and especially her mother Carmen (Lupe Ontiveros), expect her not to abandon the nest, but rather work in her older sister Estela's (Ingrid Oliu) small clothing factory that creates fancy dresses for high-end retailers. Because Estela chronically operates short of employees and money and  perilously close to production deadlines, her establishment is a figurative and literal sweatshop, especially since the fans can't be turned on as they would blow dirt onto the finished goods. Needless to say, Ana loathes working for her sister.Ana is also overweight. It doesn't help her self-image that Mom, who fears for her younger daughter's marriage prospects, habitually addresses Ana as &quot;Fatty&quot;. The two have a tense relationship.Because the creators of this film apparently endeavored to keep the storyline true to life, it also perhaps lacks entertainment value in comparison to the other movies mentioned. The finale of MONSOON WEDDING dazzled the viewer with a vibrantly colorful and joyous Indian marriage ceremony. BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM had a sports theme and included the Big Game. MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING was overtly comedic as a vegetarian WASP incorporates himself, via marriage, into an extended Greek family - emphatically neither vegetarian or WASP. WHALE RIDER included everybody's warm and fuzzy animal - whales. REAL WOMAN HAVE CURVES offers little more than a teenage girl with an understandably Bad Attitude.I'll not say that this film is totally without merit. The best sequence involves Estela's employees, all zaftig, and including Ana, comparing stretch marks and cellulite, much to Carmen's horror. And the film's very last scene leaves the viewer feeling good about Ana's prospects in life. However, the movie as a whole isn't any more entertaining than watching the next door neighbor kid be normally rebellious.

Gelwasser,"[14, 14]","Patricia Cardosa's &quot;Real Women Have Curves&quot; is a touching and humorous comedy/drama about both self-esteem and family.In the story we meet Ana (wonderfully played by America Ferrera) a smart, young, Mexican American, women who has just graduated from high school.With the help of scholarships and financial aid she has the ability to be the first in her family to go on to college. She is at that point in life, where anything is possible.Unfortunately she is opposed by her loving but extremely rigid, Mother (Lupe Ontiveros), who insists that her place and duty is to help with the family's financial survival by working in her sister's small, struggling, dress factory. Ana joins the friendly (and gossiping), female workers in the factory, but eventually she must get on with her life on her own terms.This is a beautiful movie about letting go of a person even though you love them. It is also a film about being proud of who you are. The Ana character is overweight (she's not your typical Hollywood size 2)yet she is proud of herself and sees no shame in her body.This leads to one of the funniest scenes in the movie in which Ana coxes her similarly overweight co-workers to strip down to their undies in the broiling, hot factory! Actress, America Ferrera really is a charismatic force, who just lights up the screen with her talent.The rest of the cast is equally marvelous including Lupe Ontiveros, Ingrid Oliu, George Lopez, Soldad St. Hilaire and Felipe de Alba.This is a wonderfully moving film which I highly recommend!

609312,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JLXZ,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[1, 3]","The surprise in ""Real Women Have Curves"" is not that Ana Garcia (American Ferrera) is able to get into a first rate college, given that she is the daughter of a poor Latino family in East L.A., because we buy that she is smart enough. But given her family, it is rather surprising that she dares to dream the dream. Certainly it is nothing that was every discussed around the dinner table in the Garcia family. Her father, Ra&uacute;l (Jorge Cervera, Jr.) is a gardener and her mother, Carmen (Lupe Ontiveros) makes dresses at the sweatshop run by Ana's sister, Estela (Ingrid Oliu). Her mother dismisses out of hand the idea that Ana can go to college and insists she come to work at the dress shop. Although Ana's teacher, Mr. Guzman (George Lopez), continues to encourage her it is not until Ana endures working in the sweatshop for a while that she becomes desperate enough to sit down and write that college application essay.While the story of this 2002 film begins with a young girl graduating high school and ends with her on her way to college, as the title of ""Real Women Have Curves"" should indicate, this is really about notions of self-worth and body image. Estela's shop makes dresses that are sold for ten times what they are paid on consignment from a big company that is exploiting their cheap labor. Despite her overbearing mother, Ana has enough brains to know exploitation of the workers when she sees it and enough self-confidence to challenge the way of the world for all the good that might do anybody. But then another idea becomes more important as Ana gets her co-workers to wonder why big women (the size of say, cows, hippos, elephants and orcas) should not get to wear beautiful dresses cut to their own figures. The best scene in the movie is when Ana is sweating to death in the dress shop and decides being comfortable is a worthy goal. The next thing we know the ladies are comparing their bodies and driving Ana's mother absolutely crazy.This was originally a play by Josefina Lopez, who worked on the teleplay along with George LaVoo for this film directed by Patricia Cardoso (""El Reino de los cielos""). The flaw that most stands out in this film is that having created an ideal with regards to a beautiful dress for a real woman with curves, we never get the payoff, even though such a dress materializes. This is rather disappointing seeing as how the dress becomes pivotal to my deconstructing of the film, but while I endorse the ideological sentiments of the film regarding female body image I am obviously not in a position to do so from personal knowledge, which may well indicate that I am off base here.This DVD has a pair of above average commentary tracks, the first with actresses Ferrera and Ontiveros, and the second with the director and the screenwriters. Since all are committed to the message of the film, they actually discuss the importance of what is going on and how such issues resonate in their own lives and careers (especially in terms of Lopez), rather than simply telling stories of what happened on the set and other sundry topics. Ferrera is clearly the star of this film, and her performance is a winning one whatever problems we may see with the teleplay, but for those who were introduced to Ontiveros's talents on ""Desperate Housewives"" it is certainly nice to see here playing a more completely fleshed out (so to speak) character, and her participation in the commentary track is equally as strong. In the end the key thing is that this film is not merely for Latino women, but all real women with curves, and if this film teaches them anything it is to make sure they are exposed to its rhetorical position when they are still young.",4,Young Ana Garcia takes on her mother and the world,1122768000,"07 31, 2005",2005,3706,"['surprise', 'Real', 'Women', 'Have', 'Curves', 'not', 'Ana', 'Garcia', 'American', 'Ferrera', 'able', 'get', 'first', 'rate', 'college', 'given', 'daughter', 'poor', 'Latino', 'family', 'East', 'L.A.', 'buy', 'smart', 'enough', 'given', 'family', 'rather', 'surprising', 'dream', 'dream', 'Certainly', 'nothing', 'was', 'discussed', 'dinner', 'table', 'Garcia', 'family', 'father', 'Ra', 'uacute', 'Jorge', 'Cervera', 'Jr.', 'gardener', 'mother', 'Carmen', 'Lupe', 'Ontiveros', 'dresses', 'sweatshop', 'run', 'Ana', 'sister', 'Estela', 'Ingrid', 'Oliu', 'mother', 'hand', 'idea', 'Ana', 'can', 'go', 'college', 'come', 'work', 'dress', 'shop', 'Ana', 'teacher', 'Mr.', 'Guzman', 'George', 'Lopez', 'encourage', 'not', 'Ana', 'working', 'sweatshop', 'while', 'desperate', 'enough', 'sit', 'down', 'write', 'college', 'application', 'story', '2002', 'film', 'young', 'girl', 'graduating', 'high', 'school', 'way', 'college', 'title', 'Real', 'Women', 'Have', 'Curves', 'should', 'indicate', 'really', 'notions', 'self-worth', 'body', 'image', 'Estela', 'shop', 'dresses', 'are', 'sold', 'ten', 'times', 'what', 'are', 'paid', 'consignment', 'big', 'company', 'exploiting', 'cheap', 'labor', 'overbearing', 'mother', 'Ana', 'enough', 'brains', 'know', 'exploitation', 'workers', 'when', 'enough', 'self-confidence', 'challenge', 'way', 'world', 'good', 'might', 'do', 'anybody', 'then', 'idea', 'more', 'important', 'Ana', 'co-workers', 'wonder', 'why', 'big', 'women', 'size', 'say', 'cows', 'hippos', 'elephants', 'orcas', 'should', 'not', 'get', 'wear', 'beautiful', 'dresses', 'cut', 'own', 'figures', 'best', 'scene', 'movie', 'when', 'Ana', 'sweating', 'death', 'dress', 'shop', 'decides', 'being', 'comfortable', 'worthy', 'goal', 'next', 'thing', 'know', 'ladies', 'are', 'comparing', 'bodies', 'driving', 'Ana', 'mother', 'absolutely', 'crazy.This', 'was', 'originally', 'play', 'Josefina', 'Lopez', 'who', 'worked', 'teleplay', 'George', 'LaVoo', 'film', 'directed', 'Patricia', 'Cardoso', 'El', 'Reino', 'los', 'cielos', 'flaw', 'most', 'out', 'film', 'having', 'created', 'ideal', 'regards', 'beautiful', 'dress', 'real', 'woman', 'curves', 'never', 'get', 'payoff', 'even', 'such', 'dress', 'materializes', 'rather', 'disappointing', 'seeing', 'how', 'dress', 'pivotal', 'deconstructing', 'film', 'endorse', 'ideological', 'sentiments', 'film', 'regarding', 'female', 'body', 'image', 'am', 'obviously', 'not', 'position', 'do', 'so', 'personal', 'knowledge', 'may', 'well', 'indicate', 'am', 'base', 'here.This', 'DVD', 'pair', 'above', 'average', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'first', 'actresses', 'Ferrera', 'Ontiveros', 'second', 'director', 'screenwriters', 'are', 'committed', 'message', 'film', 'actually', 'discuss', 'importance', 'what', 'going', 'how', 'such', 'issues', 'resonate', 'own', 'lives', 'careers', 'especially', 'terms', 'Lopez', 'rather', 'simply', 'telling', 'stories', 'what', 'happened', 'set', 'other', 'sundry', 'topics', 'Ferrera', 'clearly', 'star', 'film', 'performance', 'winning', 'one', 'problems', 'may', 'see', 'teleplay', 'who', 'were', 'introduced', 'Ontiveros', 'talents', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'certainly', 'nice', 'see', 'here', 'playing', 'more', 'completely', 'fleshed', 'out', 'so', 'speak', 'character', 'participation', 'commentary', 'track', 'equally', 'strong', 'end', 'key', 'thing', 'film', 'not', 'merely', 'Latino', 'women', 'real', 'women', 'curves', 'film', 'anything', 'make', 'sure', 'are', 'exposed', 'rhetorical', 'position', 'when', 'are', 'still', 'young']",N/A
609313,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B00005JLXZ,Linda Linguvic,"[19, 19]","This 2002 independent film is classified as a comedy. It's not.It's a small slice of life about a Mexican American young woman who has just graduated high school.  She dreams of going to college but her family insists she work in her older sister's dress factory.  There's a clash of cultures.  And some very moving moments.  It's a uniquely American story, one that has been told over and over again as all waves of immigrants have to deal with assimilation.  And yet, it is always fascinating.Casting is excellent.  America Ferrera plays the young woman.  She, like her mother and sister, is overweight and curvy. But the title doesn't just relate to her body.  It's about the kind of curves that woman have to deal with in life - like a curve ball thrown in a baseball game.  Lupe Ontiveros is the mother.  It's a great role, and it's easy to relate to her as she tries to keep her family together.  She has absolutely magnificent facial expressions.  One look from her tells a thousand stories.  Ingrid Oliu is the older sister trying to keep her small shop in business.  The women sew evening gowns that sell for $600 or more in Bloomingdale's.  For this, the contractor gets a mere $18 per dress.  It's hot in the shop and they work long hours.  Not a life for a young woman who has big dreams.Later, during the DVD's special feature section, Josefina Lopez, the writer, told the audience that she, herself, actually worked in one of these sweatshops.  No wonder it all seemed so authentic!This is a coming of age film.  It's also a film about women, and their bodies.  In one scene the women in the sweatshop strip down to their underwear and proudly display their very imperfect bodies to one another.  There sure was a lot of strength in that scene.

The plot moves along at an excellent pace. I can honestly say that they edited it extremely well; there's not too much here that could have been cut and that's a rarity! The cinematography and the choreography shine throughout the movie as well.When the action starts, we quickly meet 18 year old Ana Garcia (America Ferrera) who lives at home with her working class family in East Los Angeles. Ana has a sister Estela (Ingrid Oliu) who runs a small factory making dresses for just a few pennies on the dollar; and their mother Carmen (Lupe Ontiveros) works in Estela's factory. They call it a ""factory;"" but it's really just a sweatshop at best. Ana gets along fairly well with her father and she's especially close with her kindly old grandfather (Felipe de Alba); but Ana's mother Carmen is a neurotic hopelessly rooted in the past. Carmen dreams up fantasies of being pregnant at age 52; and she complains that Ana is just not like her. Carmen and Ana do not get along. Moreover, Ana has dreams of breaking out of the working class cycle of barely living paycheck to paycheck to make something of herself. Specifically, Ana wants to go to college where she can meet new people and learn exciting new things.High school ends for Ana; and as the summer goes by Ana must slowly but surely square off with her parents--and especially her mother Carmen-about college. Her high school professor Mr. Guzman (George Lopez) believes in her and Guzman even uses his political connections to get Ana a full scholarship to Columbia University in New York City. But when Mr. Guzman tells the family of this development, he is practically kicked out of their house without any thanks whatsoever--and things between Ana and her mother Carmen really start to heat up.Of course, there is more. Ana becomes romantically involved with Jimmy (Brian Sites), a young guy from her high school graduating class. Ana and Jimmy date and more things happen. How will Ana's mother Carmen ever be able to handle all this? In addition, Estela's workshop is running very low on cash. After three women of the already much too small staff suddenly quit, how will the dressmakers ever be able to meet their quotas on time if they are to get any pay at all from the distributors?What happens after all this? Will Ana ever be able to convince her stubborn, old-world mother Carmen that college is actually what's best for her? What about Ana's relationship with her grandfather--when the chips are down, will Ana abandon him? Will Ana and Jimmy have a future together? Watch and find out!The DVD comes with a few extras. There is an additional scene of Ana one year later; and we get two commentaries. There are two versions of a featurette about the movie; one is in English and the other is in Spanish.Real Women Have Curves showcases the fantastic talents of these marvelous actors; and hopefully young women will be inspired by Ana's story and reach high to achieve their dreams. This is a fine movie that also deals with coming of age issues; and for all these reasons I highly recommend this film.",5,and don't eat that flan !!!,1238803200,"04 4, 2009",2009,3215,"['Real', 'Women', 'Have', 'Curves', 'charming', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'set', 'East', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'acting', 'very', 'convincing', 'well', 'plot', 'along', 'excellent', 'pace', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'edited', 'extremely', 'well', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'here', 'that', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'rarity', 'cinematography', 'choreography', 'shine', 'movie', 'well.When', 'action', 'quickly', 'meet', '18', 'year', 'old', 'Ana', 'Garcia', 'America', 'Ferrera', 'who', 'home', 'working', 'class', 'family', 'East', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Ana', 'sister', 'Estela', 'Ingrid', 'Oliu', 'who', 'small', 'factory', 'making', 'dresses', 'just', 'few', 'pennies', 'dollar', 'mother', 'Carmen', 'Lupe', 'Ontiveros', 'Estela', 'factory', 'call', 'factory', 'really', 'just', 'sweatshop', 'best', 'Ana', 'along', 'fairly', 'well', 'father', 'especially', 'close', 'kindly', 'old', 'grandfather', 'Felipe', 'de', 'Alba', 'Ana', 'mother', 'Carmen', 'neurotic', 'hopelessly', 'rooted', 'past', 'Carmen', 'fantasies', 'being', 'pregnant', 'age', '52', 'Ana', 'just', 'not', 'Carmen', 'Ana', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'along', 'Moreover', 'Ana', 'dreams', 'breaking', 'working', 'class', 'cycle', 'barely', 'living', 'paycheck', 'paycheck', 'make', 'something', 'herself', 'Specifically', 'Ana', 'go', 'college', 'where', 'can', 'meet', 'new', 'people', 'learn', 'exciting', 'new', 'things.High', 'school', 'ends', 'Ana', 'summer', 'Ana', 'must', 'slowly', 'surely', 'square', 'off', 'parents', 'especially', 'mother', 'Carmen-about', 'college', 'high', 'school', 'Mr.', 'Guzman', 'George', 'Lopez', 'Guzman', 'even', 'political', 'connections', 'get', 'Ana', 'full', 'scholarship', 'Columbia', 'University', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'when', 'Mr.', 'Guzman', 'family', 'development', 'practically', 'kicked', 'house', 'thanks', 'whatsoever', 'things', 'Ana', 'mother', 'Carmen', 'really', 'start', 'heat', 'up.Of', 'course', 'more', 'Ana', 'romantically', 'involved', 'Jimmy', 'Brian', 'Sites', 'young', 'guy', 'high', 'school', 'graduating', 'class', 'Ana', 'Jimmy', 'date', 'more', 'things', 'happen', 'How', 'will', 'Ana', 'mother', 'Carmen', 'ever', 'be', 'able', 'handle', 'addition', 'Estela', 'workshop', 'running', 'very', 'low', 'cash', 'three', 'women', 'already', 'much', 'too', 'small', 'staff', 'suddenly', 'quit', 'how', 'will', 'dressmakers', 'ever', 'be', 'able', 'meet', 'quotas', 'time', 'are', 'get', 'pay', 'distributors', 'What', 'Will', 'Ana', 'ever', 'be', 'able', 'convince', 'stubborn', 'old-world', 'mother', 'Carmen', 'college', 'actually', 'what', 'best', 'What', 'Ana', 'relationship', 'grandfather', 'when', 'chips', 'are', 'down', 'will', 'Ana', 'abandon', 'Will', 'Ana', 'Jimmy', 'have', 'future', 'together', 'Watch', 'find', 'out', 'DVD', 'few', 'extras', 'additional', 'scene', 'Ana', 'one', 'year', 'later', 'get', 'two', 'commentaries', 'are', 'two', 'versions', 'featurette', 'movie', 'one', 'English', 'other', 'Spanish.Real', 'Women', 'Have', 'Curves', 'fantastic', 'talents', 'marvelous', 'actors', 'hopefully', 'young', 'women', 'will', 'be', 'inspired', 'Ana', 'story', 'reach', 'high', 'achieve', 'dreams', 'fine', 'movie', 'also', 'coming', 'age', 'issues', 'reasons', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film']",N/A
609317,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00005JLXZ,Matthew Horner,"[0, 0]","""Real Women Have Curves"" is a warm, funny ethnic comedy - one of the most likeable movies I have seen in a long time. It also seems rather true to life. The script has a few flaws in it [a couple of key plot points never pan out, for example], but these are not significant enough to spoil either the fun or the film's message about the joy of being yourself - or, more specifically, your own woman.Ana [America Ferrara] lives with her family in a Latino section of Los Angeles. Because of her intelligence and good grades, she's been able to attend upscale Beverly Hills High School. She's about to graduate and is definitely college material. Her mother [Lupe Ontiveros], an eccentric, neurotic woman, has other plans for Ana. She wants her to stay home and go to work in her older daughter, Estela's [Ingrid Oliv], small dress factory. The family doesn't have the money for college, and mom blissfully ignores the fact that Ana can easily qualify for grants and scholarships. Ana unhappily agrees to work in the factory, where she is ridiculed for being too overweight to fit into the stylish dresses her family churns out. But there are things in her favor - she likes who she is and what she can become. Slowly, the family comes to see Ana in a new light and to understand that her inner beauty is far more important than her exterior appearance.The cast is relatively unknown to mainstream American audiences, but it is a remarkable one.

She attends Beverly Hills High School, and works in her sister's sweatshop dress factory alongside her mother, Carmen. Ana dreams of attending Columbia while her mother wants her to stay and continue making dresses. Basically it's a movie about mother and daughters, self-image issues, and a little bit of romance.

The plot involves Ana, a Mexican-American girl just graduating from Beverly Hills High School (although she lives in East LA -- she's a high achiever despite her background as the daughter of lower-income but hardworking immigrants).  She is being encouraged by a teacher to apply to Columbia -- he thinks he can get her in with a full scholarship -- but her family expects her to go to work in her sister's ""factory"" (read: sweat shop) making formal dresses for upscale stores.  Ana is spunky and can stand her own against her strong-willed and often manipulative mother, Carmen.  Ana's father, grandfather, and sister are the saner ones in this family (as opposed to the mother), who love Ana and are more open to giving her opportunities.  Ana's mother is constantly riding her daughter about her weight (even though the mother herself is overweight) because she wants her daughter to get married and produce grandchildren for her.  Ana resists her mother's nagging, all the while she resents her mother's cruel remarks.The acting is amazing and the story rings completely true.  The issue of weight and women is very well handled -- the scene involving ""cellulite"" is unforgettable -- funny and iconic.Because the story in this film involves a Mexican-American family living in East LA, the conversations in this film flip back and forth between Spanish and English (the Spanish is subtitled).I'm sure I'll watch this movie many times.

America Ferrera plays Ana (who's 5 days younger than me), a young girl rebelling against her family's wishes. She's a size 14/16, which is the average size for a UK female in this day and age, but America wears her size with pride.Ana comes across as really insecure with her figure, although she talks back to her mother (also overweight, as is most of her family) when she makes comments about her weight. After Ana sleeps with her boyfriend, she lets him see her in the mirror, in all her glory, but then when he says he'll phone/write/email when he goes away to teacher training college, she says no to all of them. And then comes out with a severely biting remark that he'll meet some skinny girl.Ana fights for what she believes in, against her Catholic parents. When they say she can't go to college, she goes behind their back and gets accepted. She does a lot of things, most of which probably aren't featured in the film.There is a terrific scene, which features a lot of the female members of the cast in a state of undress! It's the most hilarious scene. Ana goes to work with her sister in what basically could only be described as a sweatshop, and strips down to her bra and Bridget Jones knickers cos she's so hot. The rest of the female cast start to compare stretchmarks, ripples, lumps, bulges, in all their glory! It's the highlight of the whole film.What's disappointing about the ending, when Ana gets her way, and goes off to college in New York, her 'mama' doesn't want her to, and doesn't even give her blessing or go to the airport with her. There is no resolution to this subplot, and it's almost heartbreaking to see Ana leave home, without sorting things out with her mum.Many of the characters speak Spanish in this, and there are no subtitles, which kinda grates after a while. Ana seems to speak mainly English, until she says something rude about someone in Spanish. But the whole Spanish speaking when there are no subtitles is annoying. It wouldn't be so bad if it was a little bit here and there, but a chunk of the characters speak it.This a great movie for every girl to see out there. There are real women out there. There is no need to live on coffee &amp; cigarettes, like some super skinny supermodels do. If you have curves, flaunt them - hell knows, I do!

609321,A1C2P5HX5RLPAX,B00005JLXZ,"M. E. Wood ""Content Writer and Reviewer""","[1, 3]","Real Women Have Curves is the story of Ana (played by America Ferrera), a Latina teenager, during the summer of her 18th year. Ana is beautiful. Hourglass figure with melon breasts, full lips and long thick hair. She's intelligent and strong willed but is being held back by her family, especially her mother who constantly berates her because of her physical appearance.Ana lives with her family in East Los Angeles in a Mexican community but she goes to a high school in Beverly Hills; a feat she accomplished on her own. The story begins with Ana getting ready for her last day of high school. Her mother feigns being sick to get her to stay home but Ana doesn't fall for it and heads off to school showing immediately the strained relationship between these two women and the emphasis Ana places on education.Ana's mother, Carmen (played by Lupe Ontiveros) is old school; she started working for her family when she was thirteen. She married young and became a mother. Work and family are her life. She wants the same for Ana and wants Ana to want the same which is an odd scenario because most story mom's want more for their children. Carmen constantly insults Ana about her weight in front of everyone. As the story moves on it becomes more disturbing.Estela (played by Ingrid Oliu) is Ana's adult sister. She still lives at home and runs the sewing factory where they all work, Estela's Fashion Design. They make dresses for Bloomingdales, getting $18 a dress when the store sells them for $600. This infuriates Ana as well as the fact they never make dresses bigger than size 7. Estela has many heavy weights beside the physical weight she carries. She's fighting to keep the factory open, pay the rent, get the dresses made on time to satisfy buyers and keep her employees working despite the inability to pay them their wages. Three employees move back to Mexico and Estela has Ana to promise to stay and help with a recent order.With Ana's unknowing help, Estela steps outside the box and begins designing her own dresses. As a special gift, she makes a special red gown for Ana, regrettably we never get to see Ana in it. Like Ana but to a lesser degree, Carmen berates Estella. It's during one of these time Carmen mentions love, ""It's because I love you that I make your life so miserable."" Estela replies, Love me less.George Lopez makes an appearance as Ana's teacher, Mr. Guzman. He encourages her to go to college, helps her fill out her college application and makes a special visit to plead with Ana's parents to let her go to college when she is offered a full scholarship to Columbia. Although a small role, Lopez's character is effective as the nurturing teacher looking to help a woman from his own community.The best scene in the movie is when the women in the factory, strip to their underwear to expose their secrets. It all starts when Ana can't take the heat in the factory any longer and removes her shirt to cool herself. Her mother freaks, telling her she's too fat to show that much of her body. Ana is not ashamed or afraid of her body and she lets her mother know it. The other women in the factory back her up. They begin to share their body parts and how they feel about it. They take off their clothes which further infuriates Carmen. ""this is who we are"" yells Ana, ""real women."" They all celebrate each other (without Carmen) and go back to work in their underwear after Carmen walks out. This seen easily shows how Ana and Estela evolve while Carmen seems trapped in her bitterness and insecurities. She has an opportunity to bond with her daughters, women, and chooses not to. It's very exhilarating to watch. Real Women Have Curves is worth seeing for this scene alone.Throughout the movie is laced with lots of peppy Mexican music and shots of the Mexican community. There are subtitles between family members but it isn't distracting enough to be cumbersome and adds to the angst of family.I love this little film about a strong willed girl's transition from a teenager into a woman. America Ferrera plays the part of Ana as a confident teenager who has a devilish side for egging her mother on. She still has insecurities to discover and conquer. It's easy to love her, her sister and even her mother. I would have liked Estela's storyline expanded as hers is an interesting character.Most importantly this film's success and the success of the characters are not contingent on Ana losing weight and finding true love to be happy. Real Women Have Curves is a movie not only for Latina women but, I think, for girls and women everywhere battling the views of others about how they should feel about their bodies.Original Review Posted at [...]",4,Easy to Love the Characters - Good Message,1113523200,"04 15, 2005",2005,4689,"['Real', 'Women', 'Have', 'Curves', 'story', 'Ana', 'played', 'America', 'Ferrera', 'Latina', 'teenager', 'summer', '18th', 'year', 'Ana', 'beautiful', 'Hourglass', 'figure', 'melon', 'breasts', 'full', 'lips', 'long', 'thick', 'hair', 'intelligent', 'strong', 'willed', 'being', 'held', 'back', 'family', 'especially', 'mother', 'who', 'constantly', 'because', 'physical', 'appearance.Ana', 'family', 'East', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Mexican', 'community', 'high', 'school', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'feat', 'accomplished', 'own', 'story', 'Ana', 'getting', 'ready', 'last', 'day', 'high', 'school', 'mother', 'feigns', 'being', 'sick', 'get', 'stay', 'home', 'Ana', ""n't"", 'fall', 'school', 'showing', 'immediately', 'strained', 'relationship', 'two', 'women', 'emphasis', 'Ana', 'places', 'education.Ana', 'mother', 'Carmen', 'played', 'Lupe', 'Ontiveros', 'old', 'school', 'started', 'working', 'family', 'when', 'was', 'thirteen', 'married', 'young', 'became', 'mother', 'Work', 'family', 'are', 'life', 'same', 'Ana', 'Ana', 'want', 'same', 'odd', 'scenario', 'most', 'story', 'mom', 'want', 'more', 'children', 'Carmen', 'constantly', 'Ana', 'weight', 'front', 'everyone', 'story', 'moves', 'more', 'disturbing.Estela', 'played', 'Ingrid', 'Oliu', 'Ana', 'adult', 'sister', 'still', 'home', 'sewing', 'factory', 'where', 'work', 'Estela', 'Fashion', 'Design', 'make', 'dresses', 'Bloomingdales', 'getting', '18', 'dress', 'when', 'store', '600', 'Ana', 'as', 'well', 'fact', 'never', 'make', 'dresses', 'bigger', 'size', '7', 'Estela', 'many', 'heavy', 'weights', 'physical', 'weight', 'fighting', 'keep', 'factory', 'open', 'pay', 'rent', 'get', 'dresses', 'made', 'time', 'satisfy', 'buyers', 'keep', 'employees', 'working', 'inability', 'pay', 'wages', 'Three', 'employees', 'move', 'back', 'Mexico', 'Estela', 'Ana', 'promise', 'stay', 'help', 'recent', 'order.With', 'Ana', 'unknowing', 'help', 'Estela', 'steps', 'box', 'designing', 'own', 'dresses', 'special', 'gift', 'special', 'red', 'gown', 'Ana', 'regrettably', 'never', 'get', 'see', 'Ana', 'Ana', 'lesser', 'degree', 'Carmen', 'Estella', 'one', 'time', 'Carmen', 'mentions', 'love', 'love', 'make', 'life', 'so', 'miserable', 'Estela', 'replies', 'Love', 'less.George', 'Lopez', 'appearance', 'Ana', 'teacher', 'Mr.', 'Guzman', 'go', 'college', 'fill', 'out', 'college', 'application', 'special', 'visit', 'plead', 'Ana', 'parents', 'let', 'go', 'college', 'when', 'offered', 'full', 'scholarship', 'Columbia', 'small', 'role', 'Lopez', 'character', 'effective', 'nurturing', 'teacher', 'looking', 'help', 'woman', 'own', 'community.The', 'best', 'scene', 'movie', 'when', 'women', 'factory', 'strip', 'underwear', 'expose', 'secrets', 'when', 'Ana', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'heat', 'factory', 'longer', 'shirt', 'cool', 'mother', 'freaks', 'telling', 'too', 'fat', 'show', 'much', 'body', 'Ana', 'not', 'ashamed', 'afraid', 'body', 'mother', 'know', 'other', 'women', 'factory', 'back', 'up', 'begin', 'share', 'body', 'parts', 'how', 'feel', 'take', 'off', 'clothes', 'further', 'infuriates', 'Carmen', 'who', 'are', 'yells', 'Ana', 'real', 'women', 'celebrate', 'other', 'Carmen', 'go', 'back', 'work', 'underwear', 'Carmen', 'walks', 'out', 'seen', 'easily', 'how', 'Ana', 'Estela', 'evolve', 'Carmen', 'trapped', 'bitterness', 'insecurities', 'opportunity', 'bond', 'daughters', 'women', 'not', 'very', 'exhilarating', 'watch', 'Real', 'Women', 'Have', 'Curves', 'worth', 'seeing', 'scene', 'movie', 'laced', 'lots', 'peppy', 'Mexican', 'music', 'shots', 'Mexican', 'community', 'are', 'subtitles', 'family', 'members', ""n't"", 'distracting', 'enough', 'be', 'cumbersome', 'angst', 'family.I', 'love', 'little', 'film', 'strong', 'willed', 'girl', 'transition', 'teenager', 'woman', 'America', 'Ferrera', 'part', 'Ana', 'confident', 'teenager', 'who', 'devilish', 'side', 'egging', 'mother', 'still', 'insecurities', 'discover', 'conquer', 'easy', 'love', 'sister', 'even', 'mother', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'Estela', 'storyline', 'expanded', 'hers', 'interesting', 'character.Most', 'importantly', 'film', 'success', 'success', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'contingent', 'Ana', 'losing', 'weight', 'finding', 'true', 'love', 'be', 'happy', 'Real', 'Women', 'Have', 'Curves', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'Latina', 'women', 'think', 'girls', 'women', 'everywhere', 'battling', 'views', 'others', 'how', 'should', 'feel', 'bodies.Original', 'Review', 'Posted', '[', ']']",N/A

Ana tries not to be discouraged by her mother's (Lupe Ontiveros) constant criticism and stubborn insistence that she should work, marry, and forget about college. The acceptance of her father, boyfriend, and a close friendship with her grandfather, along with her own strong sense of selfworth, provide Ana with the strength and motivation to pursue her goals.""Real Women Have Curves"" immediately impressed me as a movie about real people. The characters give a strong impression of authenticity. They seem more genuine than any movie characters in my recent memory. In this case, reality is a good thing. Ana and her family and friends are sometimes charming, sometimes exasperating, but always full of life. Ana's youthful energy and hope are palpable. The cast is excellent all around.

609328,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B00005JLXZ,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[4, 4]","REAL WOMEN HAVE CURVES is a cute coming of age story in which Ana, a first generation Mexican-American teenager, is living in a predominately Latino community of East Los Angeles. This movie is filled with culture and sun drenched streets.America Ferrera has personal experience with this type of situation and this is perhaps why she adds such beauty and understanding to her role. She knows how even school counselors will not always encourage the dreams of their students. While in real life her mother encouraged her educational goals, in this movie, Ana's mother is completely against her daughter's dream of going to college.As she is evolving very quickly into a woman, Ana learns to accept her body, her needs and her dreams about her future. While her attitude about various subjects are definitely more modern than her families traditional values, she eventually learns to respect and value her family members. Ana is trying to deal with her own inner desires and the expectations of her parents.I found this movie amusing from the perspective of someone who used to sew all her own clothes as a teenager. Living in Africa did encourage such activities. This is a story about a teenager who thinks sewing and ironing are definitely not as fun as dating and reading a good book. I found out about dating after the sewing.Like most teenagers in America, Ana finds a part-time job. What is amazing is that while attending Beverly Hills High School, she becomes almost unaware of what the rest of her family struggles with on a daily basis. I think this might have something to do with having to take three buses to get to school and three to get home. Her day is consumed with travel and walking.On the last day of school, her mother competes for her attention and Ana chooses to ignore her mother's pain and go to school anyway. There is obviously a struggle between her family responsibilities and wanting to create her own life. Her mother (Lupe Ontiveros)  is going through menopause and Ana is just finding out about her own sexuality.The two women are separated by a wide gulf of misunderstandings and life experiences. We laugh as Ana's mother says she is pregnant, all while fearing her daughter might date and become pregnant. This movie tries to also teach a bit about birth control, but fails to emphasis the need for commitment and love before consummation. To Ana, sex just seems to be something fun to do and doesn't seem to care if she sees her boyfriend again. Perhaps this emphasizes her masculine side.One of her supportive teacher, Mr. Guzman (George Lopez), keeps encouraging Ana to pursue her dreams of college, while her family wants to selfishly keep her to work in the sewing sweatshop. When Ana (the beautiful America Ferrera) does have to help her family to keep the factory working, she learns to appreciate how difficult life has been for her sister, Estela (Ingrid Oliu), and gains a new respect for her mother.I thought this movie was cute enough to watch three times and enjoyed the commentary! I liked the fact that Ana is willing to accept herself and show the world what a ""real"" woman looks like.Ana's mother is a real character and her facial expressions are at times just hilarious. She tries to teach Ana life lessons through stories, but it seems Ana is going to have to learn how to deal with life on her own. Mothers and daughters will relate well to this movie. For some reason they don't focus on any of Ana's female friendships, yet she does seem to have a rich family life and a boyfriend. She has a beautiful relationship with her grandfather who fully supports her in her dreams.A word of advice: If you burn yourself with an iron, apply an ice cube immediately. It works!A film about family and seeking fulfillment in your own life. I didn't really find this to be as much a comedy as a comforting story about finding your dreams.~The Rebecca Review",5,Designing a Life,1059868800,"08 3, 2003",2003,3904,"['REAL', 'WOMEN', 'HAVE', 'CURVES', 'cute', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'Ana', 'first', 'generation', 'Mexican-American', 'teenager', 'living', 'predominately', 'Latino', 'community', 'East', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'movie', 'filled', 'culture', 'sun', 'drenched', 'streets.America', 'Ferrera', 'personal', 'experience', 'type', 'situation', 'perhaps', 'why', 'such', 'beauty', 'understanding', 'role', 'how', 'even', 'school', 'counselors', 'will', 'not', 'always', 'encourage', 'dreams', 'students', 'real', 'life', 'mother', 'encouraged', 'educational', 'goals', 'movie', 'Ana', 'mother', 'completely', 'daughter', 'dream', 'going', 'college.As', 'evolving', 'very', 'quickly', 'woman', 'Ana', 'accept', 'body', 'needs', 'dreams', 'future', 'attitude', 'various', 'subjects', 'are', 'definitely', 'more', 'modern', 'families', 'traditional', 'values', 'eventually', 'respect', 'value', 'family', 'members', 'Ana', 'trying', 'deal', 'own', 'inner', 'desires', 'expectations', 'parents.I', 'found', 'movie', 'amusing', 'perspective', 'someone', 'who', 'used', 'sew', 'own', 'clothes', 'teenager', 'Living', 'Africa', 'did', 'encourage', 'such', 'activities', 'story', 'teenager', 'who', 'sewing', 'ironing', 'are', 'definitely', 'not', 'as', 'fun', 'dating', 'reading', 'good', 'book', 'found', 'out', 'dating', 'sewing.Like', 'most', 'teenagers', 'America', 'Ana', 'part-time', 'job', 'What', 'amazing', 'attending', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'High', 'School', 'almost', 'unaware', 'what', 'rest', 'family', 'daily', 'basis', 'think', 'might', 'have', 'something', 'do', 'having', 'take', 'three', 'buses', 'get', 'school', 'three', 'get', 'home', 'day', 'consumed', 'travel', 'walking.On', 'last', 'day', 'school', 'mother', 'competes', 'attention', 'Ana', 'ignore', 'mother', 'pain', 'go', 'school', 'anyway', 'obviously', 'struggle', 'family', 'responsibilities', 'wanting', 'create', 'own', 'life', 'mother', 'Lupe', 'Ontiveros', 'going', 'menopause', 'Ana', 'just', 'finding', 'out', 'own', 'sexuality.The', 'two', 'women', 'are', 'separated', 'wide', 'gulf', 'misunderstandings', 'life', 'experiences', 'laugh', 'Ana', 'mother', 'pregnant', 'fearing', 'daughter', 'might', 'date', 'become', 'pregnant', 'movie', 'also', 'teach', 'bit', 'birth', 'control', 'emphasis', 'need', 'commitment', 'love', 'consummation', 'Ana', 'sex', 'just', 'be', 'something', 'fun', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'care', 'boyfriend', 'again', 'Perhaps', 'masculine', 'side.One', 'supportive', 'teacher', 'Mr.', 'Guzman', 'George', 'Lopez', 'encouraging', 'Ana', 'pursue', 'dreams', 'college', 'family', 'selfishly', 'keep', 'work', 'sewing', 'sweatshop', 'When', 'Ana', 'beautiful', 'America', 'Ferrera', 'have', 'help', 'family', 'keep', 'factory', 'working', 'appreciate', 'how', 'difficult', 'life', 'been', 'sister', 'Estela', 'Ingrid', 'Oliu', 'gains', 'new', 'respect', 'mother.I', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'cute', 'enough', 'watch', 'three', 'times', 'enjoyed', 'commentary', 'liked', 'fact', 'Ana', 'willing', 'accept', 'show', 'world', 'what', 'real', 'woman', 'mother', 'real', 'character', 'facial', 'expressions', 'are', 'times', 'just', 'hilarious', 'teach', 'Ana', 'life', 'lessons', 'stories', 'Ana', 'going', 'have', 'learn', 'how', 'deal', 'life', 'own', 'Mothers', 'daughters', 'will', 'relate', 'well', 'movie', 'reason', 'do', ""n't"", 'focus', 'Ana', 'female', 'friendships', 'yet', 'seem', 'have', 'rich', 'family', 'life', 'boyfriend', 'beautiful', 'relationship', 'grandfather', 'who', 'fully', 'dreams.A', 'word', 'advice', 'burn', 'iron', 'apply', 'ice', 'cube', 'immediately', 'film', 'family', 'seeking', 'fulfillment', 'own', 'life', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'find', 'be', 'as', 'much', 'comedy', 'comforting', 'story', 'finding', 'dreams.~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",N/A

This is a wonderful movie. I laughed, my heart was warmed, and I love the messages. I'd never heard of Real Women Have Curves until happening upon it at the library.

609331,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00005JLXZ,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[3, 3]","Real Women Have Curves (Patricia Cardoso, 2002)Seeing this one the same weekend the Oscars aired was a travesty. Thoroughly snubbed by the Oscars, this film, which won a large number of other awards (including Special Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival), stood head and shoulders above much of what there was to see, according to the Academy.The story centers around Ana, a teen just graduating from high school (America Ferrara, in her screen debut), her insane family, an English teacher who keeps encouraging her to go on to college, and one of her classmates, who's been worshipping her from afar all year. While the main point of the story (reflected in the title) is Ana's unwillingness to cave into her mother's (Lupe Ontiveros [Mi Familia, As Good As It Gets, etc.]) constant cracks about her weight, much of the subtext centers on the plight of first-generation immigrant families in America. Ana and her family have it relatively good, in a number of ways; Ana finagled herself a full scholarship to Beverly Hills high school, her sister (Ingrid Oliu, from Flatliners and Stand and Deliver) is an entrepreneur running her own business, even if it is a chronically-behind-on-its-orders sweatshop, her father has a good job, etc. etc. But, like most families who live day to day wondering when the wave that will push their heads under is coming, when sudden changes occur, the whole fragile network is flung into chaos. Always, in the background, Ana's mother is telling her to lose weight, and Ana responds by refusing to feel bad about it. (And here is where the story hits a slight snag in suspension of disbelief; no matter how good the actress, casting a girl who's maybe size 14-16 in such a role made me wonder if this movie would have ever gotten released were the main character really fat.)The whole thing is loud, chaotic, and fast-moving without ever going over the top, and in that it is truly distinguished. It makes the viewer feel good without manipulating the viewer into feeling good, and that is a very rare thing in American film these days.

609335,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JLXZ,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 1]","""Real Women Have Curves"" feels a bit like a modern ethnic version of ""Georgy Girl,"" featuring a free-spirited young woman named Ana who doesn't quite fit the mold of what society believes a woman should look like.Ana is a somewhat ""overweight"" high school senior living in East LA who has dreams of being the first person in her family to go to college.  Her parents, however, have other plans for her life, which basically involve marriage, motherhood and a job working in her older sister's dress factory.  Ana faces the struggle common to many young people who happen to be first-generation Americans:  should she conform to the old-fashioned customs and traditions of her family or should she set out to make it on her own with all the advantages and opportunities available to people in this society?  ""Real Women Have Curves"" avoids becoming a culture clash clich&eacute; through its keen observation of the minutiae of everyday life.  Unlike most films, ""Real Women"" actually explores the day-to-day struggles of the working class in this country.  The people in this film worry about whether or not they will be able to make a go of their businesses, whether or not their bills will get paid, whether or not a promising young student will be allowed to go to college and make something of herself or just end up as a cog in the system that absorbs so many of the underclass.  It's these slice-of-life details that make the film interesting.Ana's main foil is her own mother, who believes not only that her daughter is overweight and, thereby, ruining her chances to make an acceptable marriage, but that she must forego college in order to help with the family business.  The majority of the conflict in the film occurs between these two women, both equally hardheaded, moody and determined to get what they want.  America Ferrara as Ana, Lupe Ontiveras as her mother and Ingrid Oliu as Estela, her hardworking, levelheaded sister, create characters who are believable, subtle and instantly recognizable.  Writers Josefina Lopez and George LaVoo have a sharp ear for the way people actually speak.  Director Patricia Cardoso doesn't try to impress us with fancy camera angles or clever cutting.  Instead, she lets the story develop naturally, allowing us to eavesdrop on a milieu that may seem strange to some of us.  Cardoso knows full well that the universal nature of what she is showing us will draw us into the story and these characters' lives.  It's nice, too, to see a film in which the young people are spending their time trying to get into good colleges instead of indulging in all the high school hijinks and hoopla we usually see in more mainstream movies these days.True, the movie does sacrifice some of its verisimilitude by trying a bit too hard to be a ""feel good"" experience.  One occasionally senses a certain straining for the upbeat moral message, as when Ana convinces her coworkers to strip down to their undies in the factory as a statement about how women should not be ashamed of their bodies just because they aren't a size six.  But the film more than makes up for that in the unconventional way in which it treats Ana's departure from her mother at the end.""Real Women Have Curves"" is a small movie but a universal one.",3,endearing slice-of-life drama,1053907200,"05 26, 2003",2003,3257,"['Real', 'Women', 'Have', 'Curves', 'bit', 'modern', 'ethnic', 'version', 'Georgy', 'Girl', 'featuring', 'free-spirited', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Ana', 'who', ""n't"", 'quite', 'fit', 'mold', 'what', 'society', 'woman', 'should', 'look', 'like.Ana', 'somewhat', 'overweight', 'high', 'school', 'senior', 'living', 'East', 'LA', 'who', 'dreams', 'being', 'first', 'person', 'family', 'go', 'college', 'parents', 'however', 'have', 'other', 'plans', 'life', 'basically', 'involve', 'marriage', 'motherhood', 'job', 'working', 'older', 'sister', 'dress', 'factory', 'Ana', 'struggle', 'common', 'many', 'young', 'people', 'who', 'happen', 'be', 'first-generation', 'Americans', 'should', 'conform', 'old-fashioned', 'customs', 'traditions', 'family', 'should', 'set', 'out', 'make', 'own', 'advantages', 'opportunities', 'available', 'people', 'society', 'Real', 'Women', 'Have', 'Curves', 'avoids', 'becoming', 'culture', 'clash', 'clich', 'eacute', 'keen', 'observation', 'minutiae', 'everyday', 'life', 'most', 'films', 'Real', 'Women', 'actually', 'day-to-day', 'struggles', 'working', 'class', 'country', 'people', 'film', 'worry', 'not', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'make', 'go', 'businesses', 'not', 'bills', 'will', 'get', 'paid', 'not', 'promising', 'young', 'student', 'will', 'be', 'allowed', 'go', 'college', 'make', 'something', 'just', 'end', 'up', 'cog', 'system', 'so', 'many', 'underclass', 'slice-of-life', 'details', 'make', 'film', 'interesting.Ana', 'main', 'foil', 'own', 'mother', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'daughter', 'overweight', 'thereby', 'ruining', 'chances', 'make', 'acceptable', 'marriage', 'must', 'forego', 'college', 'order', 'help', 'family', 'business', 'majority', 'conflict', 'film', 'two', 'women', 'equally', 'hardheaded', 'moody', 'determined', 'get', 'what', 'want', 'America', 'Ferrara', 'Ana', 'Lupe', 'Ontiveras', 'mother', 'Ingrid', 'Oliu', 'Estela', 'hardworking', 'levelheaded', 'sister', 'create', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'believable', 'subtle', 'instantly', 'recognizable', 'Writers', 'Josefina', 'Lopez', 'George', 'LaVoo', 'have', 'sharp', 'ear', 'way', 'people', 'actually', 'speak', 'Director', 'Patricia', 'Cardoso', ""n't"", 'try', 'impress', 'fancy', 'camera', 'angles', 'clever', 'cutting', 'Instead', 'story', 'develop', 'naturally', 'allowing', 'eavesdrop', 'milieu', 'may', 'seem', 'strange', 'Cardoso', 'full', 'well', 'universal', 'nature', 'what', 'showing', 'will', 'draw', 'story', 'characters', 'lives', 'nice', 'too', 'see', 'film', 'young', 'people', 'are', 'spending', 'time', 'trying', 'get', 'good', 'colleges', 'instead', 'indulging', 'high', 'school', 'hijinks', 'hoopla', 'usually', 'see', 'more', 'mainstream', 'movies', 'days.True', 'movie', 'sacrifice', 'verisimilitude', 'trying', 'bit', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'feel', 'good', 'experience', 'One', 'occasionally', 'certain', 'straining', 'upbeat', 'moral', 'message', 'when', 'Ana', 'coworkers', 'strip', 'down', 'undies', 'factory', 'statement', 'how', 'women', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'ashamed', 'bodies', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'size', 'six', 'film', 'more', 'up', 'unconventional', 'way', 'Ana', 'departure', 'mother', 'end', 'Real', 'Women', 'Have', 'Curves', 'small', 'movie', 'universal', 'one']",N/A
609336,A1L8HRCM60W0W7,B00005JLXZ,Shashank Tripathi,"[4, 4]","...and this one packs a mean punch! It is sad really to see this pretty much relegated to a speciality movie genre (perhaps because it's marketed by HBO?) while common farces like My Big Fat Greek Wedding make it to the top of popular minds.Theme-wise, and in liberal dollops of FeelGood comedy, both are about equally predictable. A pleasingly plump Ana (of Hispanic heritage) doesn't quite fit the typical beautiful woman boilerplate, the Petite Yet Voluptuous club of anorexic women. And instead is audacious enough to dream of BecomingSomething as her OldFashioned parents cherish her wedding off into a GoodFamily while chastity is still around. The cause for worry of course being her obesity, a clear social no-no (smacks a little of ""Georgy Girl""). Note that this comes from parents who between them could outweigh an African gorilla themselves.But Real Women Have Curves does a much more compelling, credible, charming job of the theme. For one thing, the mother-daughter relationship is electric, Lupe Ontiveros is a rocket in her shrewd-mom role and much of the movie's delicious pace comes from the moments between the two women at intellectual loggerheads.Much to the credit of the movie, we are spared any inane ethnic humour and a lot of the tickles happen as we see Ana come of age and forge an identity for herself despite her parent's machinations. A lot of the humour is real, credible and hence hilarious. F'instance, the mother believes it is OK for her to fat ""because I'm married""! Then there is a priceless scene where the two women disrobe in the heat of the moment and compare their tummy handles to see just how obese they are.Equally so, when Ana has her first physical encounter she tells her beau ""Turn the lights on. I want you to see me. See, this is what I look like."" He responds, ""You're not fat. You're beautiful.""It's easy to see why this film swept hearts away at Cannes (+ an Oscar?)... it's a touching coming-of-age ode to a culture that values family and a woman who values herself. Plus, the humour is actually amusing, a great thing in itself these days.

609342,A1ICEZXI9PTCN3,B00005JLXZ,"""troytron""","[7, 7]","What a gem of a film! I saw immediately why this little masterpiece made such a fuss at Sundance. The film has been compared to 'Greek Wedding' in many ways, and there are some similarities: contentious, ethnic family issues; female with body-image issues;etc. However, from the soundtrack to the outstanding peformances, this film actually tops the fine 'Greek Wedding' because it is just as funny, accessibly artful, and most of all, it never pushes caricatures -- never overbakes the ethnic ""ham"" card in an attempt to get laughs. A realistic and, at times, almost surrealistic, work, 'Real Women' details the plight of Ana, a bright new grad from Beverly Hills High School who just happens to live in poor East Los Angeles with her extended Latino family. There is a great deal of love in her home, as is evident by Ana's relationship with her Grandfather, her father, her cousins, and even her surly, harried, dressmaker big sister, Estela. However, Ana and her mother, Carmen, are always at odds. Carmen and Ana are both obstinate, moody, overweight women -- the difference is that Mama thinks Daughter should abandon any notions of pursuing a future based upon her intellectual talents and sacrifice her happiness for the good of keeping the family unit intact. Mama belittles Ana constantly -- not so much in a deliberately cruel way, as in a way that indicates Mama's own self-awareness as an overweight martyr and her desire to raise Ana just as she herself was raised. Basically, she wants Ana to suffer hardship and undue toil in life, just like herself. The friction between old-fashioned mother and modern, stubborn daughter is the occasion for some great laughs. All of their bickering seems very real without becoming campy -- a problem that sometimes bogged down the lovely 'Greek Wedding' film. The excellent dialogue is a tribute to the screenplay adapted from Josefina's original play. The conflict here centers upon how Ana and her family are going to handle Ana's acceptance into Columbia University on a full scholarship. Mama tries everything in her repertoire of Guilt to break Ana's spirit of ambition, even to the point of forcing Ana into a godawful job at big sister Estela's dress-shop/sweatshop. The best commentary takes place there, where several of the workers provide superb characterizations without ever overplaying their roles. The laughs and heartfelt realizations never stop coming in this movie. A subplot in which Ana responsibly handles her first crush/sexual-relationship is handled with such poignancy, good-taste, and realism, that you can't help but marvel at the ""powerful restraint"" of the film's theme and direction. A truly perfect soundtrack of Mexican/Latin music hovers over the whole mix and the overall effect is warm and reshreshingly inviting. You will be drawn into the singular magic of this movie because it is so delicately orchestrated and displays not a shred of the contrived ""reality"" that seems to have saturated our entertainment culture. The movie is wonderfully, wistfully HUMAN. The performances by newcomer America Ferrero(Ana) and Lupe Ontiveros(Mama)are superb -- as are those by everyone in the cast, with special mention of the actress who plays Estella's overworked, pragmatic sister (PERFECT!). Will Ana find a way to move forward into *her* future against Mama's wishes and her own temptations to ""settle"" where her culture tells her she must settle? Will Estella's gaggle of lovable, flabby seamstresses finish their dresses on time to save the day -- and their jobs? Will they all just fade into the buzz and hustle of LA and be forgotten as the sun and the smog sets into the sultry barrio nights? Buy this ""keeper"" of a film and find out. You won't regret it.",5,I'm Glad She Didn't Wed -- Greek or Otherwise,1058054400,"07 13, 2003",2003,3742,"['What', 'gem', 'film', 'saw', 'immediately', 'why', 'little', 'masterpiece', 'made', 'fuss', 'Sundance', 'film', 'been', 'compared', ""'Greek"", 'Wedding', 'many', 'ways', 'are', 'similarities', 'contentious', 'ethnic', 'family', 'issues', 'female', 'body-image', 'issues', 'etc', 'However', 'soundtrack', 'outstanding', 'peformances', 'film', 'actually', 'fine', ""'Greek"", 'Wedding', 'just', 'funny', 'accessibly', 'artful', 'most', 'never', 'caricatures', 'never', 'ethnic', 'ham', 'card', 'attempt', 'get', 'laughs', 'A', 'realistic', 'times', 'almost', 'surrealistic', 'work', ""'Real"", 'Women', 'details', 'plight', 'Ana', 'bright', 'new', 'grad', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'High', 'School', 'who', 'just', 'live', 'poor', 'East', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'extended', 'Latino', 'family', 'great', 'deal', 'love', 'home', 'evident', 'Ana', 'relationship', 'Grandfather', 'father', 'cousins', 'even', 'surly', 'harried', 'dressmaker', 'big', 'sister', 'Estela', 'However', 'Ana', 'mother', 'Carmen', 'are', 'always', 'odds', 'Carmen', 'Ana', 'are', 'obstinate', 'moody', 'overweight', 'women', 'difference', 'Mama', 'Daughter', 'should', 'abandon', 'notions', 'pursuing', 'future', 'based', 'intellectual', 'talents', 'sacrifice', 'happiness', 'good', 'keeping', 'family', 'unit', 'intact', 'Mama', 'Ana', 'constantly', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'deliberately', 'cruel', 'way', 'way', 'Mama', 'own', 'self-awareness', 'overweight', 'martyr', 'desire', 'raise', 'Ana', 'just', 'was', 'raised', 'Basically', 'Ana', 'suffer', 'hardship', 'undue', 'toil', 'life', 'just', 'friction', 'old-fashioned', 'mother', 'modern', 'stubborn', 'daughter', 'occasion', 'great', 'laughs', 'bickering', 'very', 'real', 'becoming', 'campy', 'problem', 'sometimes', 'bogged', 'lovely', ""'Greek"", 'Wedding', 'film', 'excellent', 'dialogue', 'tribute', 'screenplay', 'adapted', 'Josefina', 'original', 'play', 'conflict', 'here', 'centers', 'how', 'Ana', 'family', 'are', 'going', 'handle', 'Ana', 'acceptance', 'Columbia', 'University', 'full', 'scholarship', 'Mama', 'everything', 'repertoire', 'Guilt', 'break', 'Ana', 'spirit', 'ambition', 'even', 'point', 'forcing', 'Ana', 'godawful', 'job', 'big', 'sister', 'Estela', 'dress-shop/sweatshop', 'best', 'commentary', 'place', 'there', 'where', 'several', 'workers', 'provide', 'superb', 'characterizations', 'ever', 'overplaying', 'roles', 'laughs', 'heartfelt', 'realizations', 'never', 'stop', 'coming', 'movie', 'subplot', 'Ana', 'responsibly', 'first', 'crush/sexual-relationship', 'handled', 'such', 'poignancy', 'good-taste', 'realism', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'marvel', 'powerful', 'restraint', 'film', 'theme', 'direction', 'truly', 'perfect', 'soundtrack', 'Mexican/Latin', 'music', 'hovers', 'whole', 'mix', 'overall', 'effect', 'warm', 'reshreshingly', 'inviting', 'will', 'be', 'drawn', 'singular', 'magic', 'movie', 'so', 'delicately', 'orchestrated', 'not', 'shred', 'contrived', 'reality', 'have', 'saturated', 'entertainment', 'culture', 'movie', 'wonderfully', 'wistfully', 'HUMAN', 'performances', 'newcomer', 'America', 'Ferrero', 'Ana', 'Lupe', 'Ontiveros', 'Mama', 'are', 'superb', 'are', 'everyone', 'cast', 'special', 'mention', 'actress', 'who', 'Estella', 'overworked', 'pragmatic', 'sister', 'PERFECT', 'Will', 'Ana', 'find', 'way', 'move', 'forward', '*her*', 'future', 'Mama', 'wishes', 'own', 'temptations', 'settle', 'where', 'culture', 'must', 'settle', 'Will', 'Estella', 'gaggle', 'lovable', 'flabby', 'seamstresses', 'finish', 'dresses', 'time', 'save', 'day', 'jobs', 'just', 'fade', 'buzz', 'hustle', 'LA', 'be', 'forgotten', 'sun', 'smog', 'sets', 'sultry', 'barrio', 'nights', 'Buy', 'keeper', 'film', 'find', 'out', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret']",N/A

Anna is an intelligent Hispanic girl, about to graduate from high school and encouraged by her professor to continue her studies in college. Anna's mother however has other plans for her: work at her sister's dress factory, loose weight and eventually find a husband. This mother has already given up on Anna's big sister, Estella, and now concentrates her efforts, manipulations and prayers on Anna. Anna herself, ambitious and proud of her body and brains has other plans for herself and she is not the one to be quiet about it.The tale is not very unique, however truly enjoyable to watch, especially due to the major change -  a &quot;real woman&quot; for the main character and not some skinny Hollywood girl. No...the women in this movie are curvy, fat and proud of their stretch marks..The fat-comparing scene, which is one of the movie's climax moments reminds me of Mel Gibson and Rene Russo comparing their scars in &quot;Lethal weapon&quot; and its as funny to watch.Both Anna and her sister are lovely, real women characters, which immediately receive the viewer's sympathy. Their mother, however, is the one who evokes all possible emotions - ranging from hate to pity to compassion. I must confess I did not know that Hispanic mothers are a true rival to Jewish mothers in their ability to evoke drama and use all possible manipulations in order to make their child succumb to their wishes. This mother (which makes Anna and the viewer alike upset with her constant harassing and comments about Anna's fat) can be pitied and endearing at the same time and you end up understanding the way Anna feels.Anna grows up to be an impressive young lady who shows in her character a lot of what she received from her parents and family.

Since she's the leading character in this film, she has to move the audience with her character's everyday struggles, and the growth she will have throughout the 90 minute film.
