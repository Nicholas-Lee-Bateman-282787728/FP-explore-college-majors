It's a wonderfully dark, supernatural tale of witches, satanism, and creepy Puritans! Toss in an eeevil kid named Jennifer, and Hope Lange as the beleaguered heroine, and you've got a 70s TV classic!  Maggie (Lange) inherits the property of the title after her relative dies in a car ""accident"". Of course, we know better! Things start going south very quickly, especially when 10yo Jennifer joins the family! More ""accidents"" occur, and Maggie becomes increasingly convinced that she and her husband are being attacked by eeevil spirits.

In fact, virtually all of ABC's MOTW were great, and finally they are releasing some on DVD (Gargoyles, Trilogy of Terror, The Night Stalker, Scream of the Wolf, etc.). I am genuinely happy to have CF in my collection.I enjoyed the supernatural plot as I did before, and couldn't help thinking what a handsome guy Paul Burke was (even more so with longer hair than when he was in Twelve O'clock High), and how gorgeous Hope Lange was. It was lovely to see the cast of character actors with whom I grew up.However, I was disappointed by the quality of the video, which wasn't anywhere near the caliber of the movies I mentioned above. There was real blurriness to the film, kind of like when you had a VHS version and then used another machine to make a second VHS copy. Also, there was no menu, extras, or anything: when the movie ended, the screen simply went blank. Obviously whoever created this version had no desire for basic 'extras.' When I opened the DVD case, I was startled to see that the DVD label looked like someone had printed it out at home rather than it being a professional release.I wish the company that released this took more care and respect in producing the product than they did.",3,"Good Old Movie of the Week, but ...",1371513600,"06 18, 2013",2013,1279,"['loved', 'old', 'TV', 'movie', 'remember', 'watching', 'when', 'was', 'college', 'fact', 'virtually', 'ABC', 'MOTW', 'were', 'great', 'finally', 'are', 'releasing', 'DVD', 'Gargoyles', 'Trilogy', 'Terror', 'Night', 'Stalker', 'Scream', 'Wolf', 'etc.', 'am', 'genuinely', 'happy', 'have', 'CF', 'collection.I', 'enjoyed', 'supernatural', 'plot', 'did', 'before', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'thinking', 'what', 'handsome', 'guy', 'Paul', 'Burke', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'longer', 'hair', 'when', 'was', 'Twelve', ""O'clock"", 'High', 'how', 'gorgeous', 'Hope', 'Lange', 'was', 'was', 'lovely', 'see', 'cast', 'character', 'actors', 'whom', 'grew', 'up.However', 'was', 'disappointed', 'quality', 'video', 'was', ""n't"", 'anywhere', 'caliber', 'movies', 'mentioned', 'above', 'was', 'real', 'blurriness', 'film', 'kind', 'when', 'had', 'VHS', 'version', 'then', 'used', 'machine', 'make', 'second', 'VHS', 'copy', 'Also', 'was', 'menu', 'extras', 'anything', 'when', 'movie', 'ended', 'screen', 'simply', 'went', 'blank', 'Obviously', 'whoever', 'created', 'version', 'had', 'desire', 'basic', ""'extras"", 'When', 'opened', 'DVD', 'case', 'was', 'startled', 'see', 'DVD', 'label', 'looked', 'someone', 'had', 'printed', 'out', 'home', 'rather', 'being', 'professional', 'release.I', 'wish', 'company', 'released', 'took', 'more', 'care', 'respect', 'producing', 'product', 'did']",N/A
