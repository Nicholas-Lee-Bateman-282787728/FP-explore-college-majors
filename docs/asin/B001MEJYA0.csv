1216843,A328S9RN3U5M68,B001MEJYA0,Grady Harp,"[1, 2]","Wallace Shawn wrote the very fine 'My Dinner with Andre', a talky but sensitive film that created a niche for conversational stories without plot.  Sadly the qualities of that play to film result did not make it with his MARIE AND BRUCE.  On paper it looks as though this strenuously boring film should be worth watching: Shawn's previous credentials, the direction by Tom Cairns, and the presence of Julianne Moore and  Matthew Broderick together with little feature appearances by the likes of Campbell Scott and Blossom Dearie should suggest investing time in viewing.Unfortunately the film's premise is so dull that even the technique of having characters speak exactly what is in their minds mixed with dialogue seemingly more appropriate for human ears and adding dreamlike sequences including some rather randy voyeurism - stage worthy though these techniques may be - just can't make this dreary story of a day in the dissolution of a VERY bad marriage work.  The only character in the film with whom the viewer can empathize is a friendly dog.  Pass on this sad flop.

Am still trying to find a category for this, but mostly it fits into the day in the life of a dysfunctional marriage in Manhattan film.Julianne Moore is why I watch any movie, and in the end, was the only reason I suffered through to see the credits role. Imagine a mix of What Dreams May Come, meets Blindness, meets Broderick running from the Out on a Limb set (filmed locally here and I swear he is wearing the same clothes and glasses) meets a mid-life crisis. The film is narrated by our married couple both to the camera and in their heads, sometimes blurring what is real and what becomes a dream through the coarse of one day in the city.The dialogue becomes so tedious and frustrating by anyone who opens their mouth that you wish it would have stayed on the stage, as I believe this was the original location of this pedantic story. I cannot find the words to describe the variety of self loathing narratives and forced conversations. To summarize briefly, nothing jumped out at me to hold an interest and I give it another star just on JM's ability to hold a film together with her expressions and genuine look of disgust in what she is doing.No extras to speak of from Genius once again.",2,Another forgotten Genius dumping film,1236902400,"03 13, 2009",2009,1346,"['took', 'five', 'years', 'Genius', 'get', 'DVD', 'suppose', 'are', 'trying', 'span', 'little-known', 'sets', 'time', 'Am', 'still', 'trying', 'find', 'category', 'mostly', 'day', 'life', 'dysfunctional', 'marriage', 'Manhattan', 'film.Julianne', 'Moore', 'why', 'watch', 'movie', 'end', 'was', 'only', 'reason', 'suffered', 'see', 'credits', 'role', 'Imagine', 'mix', 'What', 'Dreams', 'May', 'Come', 'Blindness', 'Broderick', 'running', 'Out', 'Limb', 'set', 'filmed', 'locally', 'here', 'swear', 'wearing', 'same', 'clothes', 'glasses', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'film', 'narrated', 'married', 'couple', 'camera', 'heads', 'sometimes', 'blurring', 'what', 'real', 'what', 'dream', 'coarse', 'one', 'day', 'city.The', 'dialogue', 'so', 'tedious', 'frustrating', 'anyone', 'who', 'mouth', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'stayed', 'stage', 'believe', 'was', 'original', 'location', 'pedantic', 'story', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'words', 'describe', 'variety', 'self', 'loathing', 'narratives', 'forced', 'conversations', 'summarize', 'briefly', 'nothing', 'jumped', 'out', 'hold', 'interest', 'give', 'star', 'just', 'JM', 'ability', 'hold', 'film', 'together', 'expressions', 'genuine', 'look', 'disgust', 'what', 'doing.No', 'extras', 'speak', 'Genius', 'once', 'again']",Marie and Bruce
1216846,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B001MEJYA0,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[3, 4]","""Marie and Bruce,""  based on a play by Wallace Shawn, focuses on one day in the life of a dysfunctional Manhattan couple (Julianne Moore, Matthew Broderick).  The film opens with Marie's pronouncement that their long-deteriorating marriage is over and she is leaving.  During the next 24 hours,  each vents, recalls happier times, and expresses hopes for the future.  Despite a few attempts to open up the action the movie can't shake its stage origins.  It is very talky, and because you have two unhappy people unloading their frustrations and gripes, things become pretty grating.  Both Moore and Broderick are good, but it's hard to warm to their characters.  Though ""Marie and Bruce"" is only 90 minutes long, it seems endless.  Language is often profane and there is some nudity, which explains the R rating.
