662455,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B00005LB88,Acute Observer,"[1, 1]","Hanover Street, 1978 filmThis story is set in war-time London. People queue up to catch a bus. [They are quiet.] An American pilot meets a British girl in uniform, they dine together. She works in a hospital, David Halloran is from Chicago and pilots a B-25. Bombs explode, people run away. Halloran kisses his woman. Will they meet again? She says no. Halloran attends a briefing on another bombing mission. [Does he talk too much?] The enemy fires cannons at them; some are hit. [Some words are deleted.] They release their bombs over the target. Later Halloran returns to that street corner, she meets him, they to an inn. Romantic times. She won&#8217;t tell her name. Halloran is on another mission. Does he have an attitude? Halloran meets that woman again; and again. Her name is Margaret. Agents sent to France were quickly caught. Is there a double agent in London?There is another bombing mission. Halloran notices something wrong with the #1 engine, but nothing registers on the gauges. It is Christmas time. There is a dance for the Army Air Corps. [Do those people look too old?] Halloran hears about the raid. [No armed guards by those bombers?] A man in an enemy uniform is questioned. Dave and Margaret meet again. [Did women use eyeliner in those days? Wartime rationing.] There is a course in lock-picking for Lt. Wells. [Its easy for an expert.] The Colonel asks Lt. Halloran to volunteer for a mission. Paul telephones Margaret: &#8220;I love you&#8221;. [No blackout covers on those headlights at night?] Could a British spy be passed off as a German Major? Is that believable?] Margaret reads the letter from Paul.The B-25 is hit by anti-aircraft fire. &#8220;He has no face.&#8221; David bails out and lands in France; he will head west to the coast. Will Paul have a problem? Does traveling together look suspicious? Hiding in the hay leads to a problem. [Is comedy out of place here?] Could Halloran impersonate a German Sergeant? [Is that a regulation haircut?] Later they return for those papers. Will something go wrong? [It&#8217;s a movie.] There is a chase for action. They return to that French barn. Will they be noticed? [Something to add drama?] Enemy troops arrive. Can they create a diversion to get away? There is another chase [for action]. An armored vehicle shells them. There is a daring rescue, they are returned to England. David says goodbye to Margaret. And so it ends in a proper manner.This is about average for a TV movie, but less for a Hollywood movie (production budget). Was it done to take advantage of a new popular star fresh from &#8220;Star Wars&#8221;? The story seems like an echo from earlier films. Why was it set during WW II?

Still, it was just a little too predictable.Margaret Sellinger (Lesley-Anne Down) is a volunteer at a military hospital in London in 1943. David Halloran (Harrison Ford) is a Yankee soldier who meets her trying to get on an over-crowded bus, takes her to tea, and predictably falls in love with her. She falls in love with him, too. She wouldn't even tell him her first name for quite a while, eventually says it is Margaret. Just Margaret. What she does not tell him (although apparently he guessed) is that she is married to Captain Sellinger (Christopher Plummer) of British Intelligence. And they have a bright, charming daughter. Still, Margaret meets Halloran on Hanover Street, they go to out of the way inns and make love.Halloran is a pilot. So when British Intelligence plans a very dangerous mission inside Nazi-occupied France, they decide to ask the Yanks to help them, since there is obviously a leak in their organization. (For awhile I thought perhaps Captain Sellinger was the leak. He's not.) Obviously, Halloran ends up being the pilot on this dangerous secret mission.Predictably, Captain Sellinger takes the mission himself (to impress his wife with his courage), and he and Halloran end up in trouble in France. No, I'm not going to tell you whether either or both survive to return to Margaret.Still, it is a pretty good movie, even though it's rather predictable.",3,Sexy Harrison Ford in a Rather Predictable War Movie,1336867200,"05 13, 2012",2012,1511,"['love', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'really', 'do', 'So', 'was', 'prepared', 'love', 'film', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'also', 'favorite', 'mine', 'Still', 'was', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'predictable.Margaret', 'Sellinger', 'Lesley-Anne', 'Down', 'volunteer', 'military', 'hospital', 'London', '1943', 'David', 'Halloran', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Yankee', 'soldier', 'who', 'trying', 'get', 'over-crowded', 'bus', 'tea', 'predictably', 'love', 'love', 'too', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'tell', 'first', 'name', 'quite', 'while', 'eventually', 'Margaret', 'Just', 'Margaret', 'What', 'not', 'tell', 'apparently', 'guessed', 'married', 'Captain', 'Sellinger', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'British', 'Intelligence', 'have', 'bright', 'charming', 'daughter', 'Still', 'Margaret', 'Halloran', 'Hanover', 'Street', 'go', 'way', 'inns', 'make', 'love.Halloran', 'pilot', 'So', 'when', 'British', 'Intelligence', 'very', 'dangerous', 'mission', 'Nazi-occupied', 'France', 'decide', 'ask', 'Yanks', 'help', 'obviously', 'leak', 'organization', 'awhile', 'thought', 'perhaps', 'Captain', 'Sellinger', 'was', 'leak', 'not', 'Obviously', 'Halloran', 'up', 'being', 'pilot', 'dangerous', 'secret', 'mission.Predictably', 'Captain', 'Sellinger', 'mission', 'impress', 'wife', 'courage', 'Halloran', 'end', 'up', 'trouble', 'France', 'No', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'tell', 'survive', 'return', 'Margaret.Still', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'even', 'rather', 'predictable']",N/A

Chow,"[3, 7]","In case you haven't heard `Hanover Street' 100% directed in a 50s style of Hollywood fantasy, music, acting, editing, and dialogue which by today's standards comes across as cheesy rather than nostalgic.""Embarrassing"" is a better description than horrible. Embarrassing is how to describe the way the film makers should have felt. That professional filmmakers and producers sat down and decided to direct a WWII film in 50s fashion is truly embarrassing.The Plot: Not that bad or good, `Hanover Street' utilizes the winning WWII genre guaranteed to provide at least some entertainment. American pilot Harrison Ford falls for a married Londoner during a German air raid. (Although no exact year is given, the American involvement in the War and the occupation of France would place it between 1942 and the summer of 1944 and I'm not aware of a German bombing of London during that time.)The love affair is meaningless. They are not in love and do not even talk enough to exchange names. All their time is spent in the bedroom, but due to the 50s retro and PG rating nothing is happing there either. The only impact it has is on Ford's skills as a B25 bomber over France, no longer the Maverick flier he is unwilling to risk his life. The only interesting thing about these bombing raids is that Ford's copilot is played by Michael Sack star of `Slaughterhouse Five' and `Sugarland Express.' One of his few films.Danger arrives when Ford is ordered to deliver a deep cover agent, Christopher Plummer to occupied France and their B25 is shot down. Deep behind German lines Plummer must get the German illiterate Ford back to England. As the two soldiers bond Ford realizes Plummer is his lover's husband.After 90 minutes of low production quality `Hanover Street' does provide a heart pounding well directed action packed escape from France. Unfortunately by then I was too asleep to even remember if Ford survives and I don't care. I recall that Plummer makes it back to England to reunite with his wife and rebuild their marriage.Herald as one of Ford's few WWII films (The other being the far better `Force 10 From Navarone', `Indiana Jones' does not count since none of them took place during WWII.) `Hanover Street' has thankfully been forgotten with other 80s' 50s retro movies like `1941' and `Streets on Fire'.

662465,A1HX00DL0SZM1G,B00005LB88,"Darren Harrison ""DVD collector and reviewer""","[36, 37]","When Harrison Ford saw an advance cut of the original STAR WARS movie he realized the powerful impact the movie made. In subsequent interviews Ford said that it was at that point that he realized that he needed to get to work in a variety of projects so he could avoid being stereotyped by the role of Han Solo. Of the three leads of that movie that shook the world in 1977 he was the most active in the years immediately following, and the strategy appears to  have worked as now, almost 30 years later, he is the only one who is considered a megastar.One of the movies Ford chose was the World War II romantic drama HANOVER STREET in the role of American bomber pilot David Halloran who falls for married English nurse Margaret Sellinger. The Halloran role was originally to be  played by Kris Kristofferson, but it is a testament to Fords personality and acting that it is hard to imagine the movie as it was originally cast.Viewed today the movie has an impressive cast, but at that time Ford was perhaps the least known of the three leads.Playing Sellinger is the amazing and impossibly beautiful Lesley-Anne Down who was well known to British television audiences (in UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS) and in addition to an appearance in 1976s THE PINK PANTHER STRIKES AGAIN had, a year previously, appeared  opposite Sean Connery and Donald Sutherland in THE GREAT TRAIN ROBBERY.Down would go on to make other movies such as ROUGH CUT (with Burt Reynolds) and my personal-favorite SPHINX (with Sir John Gielgud and John Rhys-Davies). But here she plays a nurse caught in a love triangle between the hotshot flier (Ford) and her British intelligence husband  Paul (played by screen great Christopher Plummer).The movie really picks up the pace when David and Paul have to work together behind enemy lines. There is dramatic tension there as Halloran is initially unaware of the connection he shares with Paul and yet, the success of the mission depends on them cooperating. This is not an action movie by any means, but when there is action on the screen it is handled well in a nice understated manner.It seems that the transfer on this DVD has come in for some criticism, but I found it serviceable. I think the movie is actually quite beautiful at times.The direction by Peter Hyams is steady and he keeps the movie focused on the human drama unfolding before you. He also supplies an audio commentary for this DVD release that is amiable and light.On a trivia note, the young Sellinger's daughter Sarah is portrayed by the actress (and singer for the group Eighth Wonder) Patsy Kensit, who ten years later would appear opposite Mel Gibson in the action movie LETHAL WEAPON 2.Three trailers round out the special features.",4,Romantic gem that tugs on the heart strings - a nostalgic favorite,1147305600,"05 11, 2006",2006,2718,"['When', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'saw', 'advance', 'cut', 'original', 'STAR', 'WARS', 'movie', 'realized', 'powerful', 'impact', 'movie', 'made', 'subsequent', 'interviews', 'Ford', 'said', 'was', 'point', 'realized', 'needed', 'get', 'work', 'variety', 'projects', 'could', 'avoid', 'being', 'stereotyped', 'role', 'Han', 'Solo', 'three', 'leads', 'movie', 'shook', 'world', '1977', 'was', 'most', 'active', 'years', 'immediately', 'following', 'strategy', 'have', 'worked', 'now', 'almost', '30', 'years', 'later', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'considered', 'megastar.One', 'movies', 'Ford', 'chose', 'was', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'romantic', 'drama', 'HANOVER', 'STREET', 'role', 'American', 'bomber', 'pilot', 'David', 'Halloran', 'who', 'married', 'English', 'nurse', 'Margaret', 'Sellinger', 'Halloran', 'role', 'was', 'originally', 'be', 'played', 'Kris', 'Kristofferson', 'testament', 'Fords', 'personality', 'acting', 'hard', 'imagine', 'movie', 'was', 'originally', 'cast.Viewed', 'today', 'movie', 'impressive', 'cast', 'time', 'Ford', 'was', 'perhaps', 'least', 'known', 'three', 'leads.Playing', 'Sellinger', 'amazing', 'impossibly', 'beautiful', 'Lesley-Anne', 'Down', 'who', 'was', 'well', 'known', 'British', 'television', 'audiences', 'UPSTAIRS', 'DOWNSTAIRS', 'addition', 'appearance', '1976s', 'THE', 'PINK', 'PANTHER', 'STRIKES', 'AGAIN', 'had', 'year', 'previously', 'appeared', 'opposite', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'THE', 'GREAT', 'TRAIN', 'ROBBERY.Down', 'would', 'go', 'make', 'other', 'movies', 'such', 'ROUGH', 'CUT', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'personal-favorite', 'SPHINX', 'Sir', 'John', 'Gielgud', 'John', 'Rhys-Davies', 'here', 'nurse', 'caught', 'love', 'triangle', 'hotshot', 'flier', 'Ford', 'British', 'intelligence', 'husband', 'Paul', 'played', 'screen', 'great', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', '.The', 'movie', 'really', 'up', 'pace', 'when', 'David', 'Paul', 'have', 'work', 'together', 'enemy', 'lines', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'there', 'Halloran', 'initially', 'unaware', 'connection', 'shares', 'Paul', 'yet', 'success', 'mission', 'cooperating', 'not', 'action', 'movie', 'means', 'when', 'action', 'screen', 'handled', 'well', 'nice', 'understated', 'manner.It', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'come', 'criticism', 'found', 'serviceable', 'think', 'movie', 'actually', 'quite', 'beautiful', 'times.The', 'direction', 'Peter', 'Hyams', 'steady', 'movie', 'focused', 'human', 'drama', 'unfolding', 'also', 'audio', 'commentary', 'DVD', 'release', 'amiable', 'trivia', 'note', 'young', 'Sellinger', 'daughter', 'Sarah', 'portrayed', 'actress', 'singer', 'group', 'Eighth', 'Wonder', 'Patsy', 'Kensit', 'who', 'ten', 'years', 'later', 'would', 'appear', 'opposite', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'action', 'movie', 'LETHAL', 'WEAPON', '2.Three', 'trailers', 'round', 'out', 'special', 'features']",N/A

At the time, I thought ""Hanover Street"" was one of those movies that was so bad it was good.  But now that I'm an adult and I have revisited it, I see much more there that I didn't appreciate as a teenager.I love these characters...David Halloran starts out as being a wise-arse bomber pilot who takes nothing seriously.  After he begins his affair with Margaret (whom he nicknames ""Fred"" when she won't tell him her name at first), he realizes that his love for her has become the most important thing in his life, and it almost makes him lose his edge as a risk-taker (a quality he has relied on to become a leader in his squadron).Paul Sellinger, a self-described ""pleasant"" fellow, is also in love with Margaret, his wife.  His love for her makes him become brave and reckless as he senses her slipping away from him...he wants to be a hero for her, a hero like he sees Halloran as being, even though he has no clue about his wife's affair with the dashing bomber pilot.Margaret herself is kind of like a leaf on the wind...she loves her husband, her home, her daughter, her privileged life, but she also loves Halloran and the fire and passion he brings.  The brutality and uncertainty of life in a time of war makes Halloran irresistible to her, yet the guilt she feels over her infidelity weigh on her soul whenever she is not with him.  Even at the end of the movie, you don't get the feeling that she has resolved herself to what must be as Halloran has.  That is really the most unsatisfying thing about ""Hanover Street"" -- it has an unfinished quality about it, as though there should be more between Margaret and Paul at the end to make it seem more uplifting.For whatever weaknesses may be in the actual storytelling, there are many scenes that are real gems.  Every scene with Margaret, Sellinger, and their daughter stands out with very witty and warm dialogue.  Halloran and Sellinger's mission to Nazi-occupied France is also excellent from beginning to end...even though I had seen the movie before, I was still on the edge of my seat the entire time.""Hanover Street"" is basically the story of how the love of one woman can affect two men in very different ways.  It makes one man weak, and makes the other man strong.  Had the storytelling been more even, this could have become a classic film.  As it stands, though, it's an enjoyable film full of romance and adventure, and I'm glad I was able to see it again after all these years.",4,"""Hello, old friend....""",1234742400,"02 16, 2009",2009,2535,"['movie', 'came', 'out', 'when', 'was', 'teens', 'madly', 'love', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'time', 'thought', 'Hanover', 'Street', 'was', 'one', 'movies', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'was', 'good', 'now', ""'m"", 'adult', 'have', 'revisited', 'see', 'much', 'more', 'did', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'teenager.I', 'characters', 'David', 'Halloran', 'out', 'being', 'wise-arse', 'bomber', 'pilot', 'who', 'nothing', 'seriously', 'affair', 'Margaret', 'whom', 'Fred', 'when', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'name', 'first', 'love', 'become', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'life', 'almost', 'lose', 'edge', 'risk-taker', 'quality', 'relied', 'become', 'leader', 'squadron', '.Paul', 'Sellinger', 'self-described', 'pleasant', 'fellow', 'also', 'love', 'Margaret', 'wife', 'love', 'become', 'brave', 'reckless', 'slipping', 'away', 'be', 'hero', 'hero', 'Halloran', 'being', 'even', 'clue', 'wife', 'affair', 'dashing', 'bomber', 'pilot.Margaret', 'kind', 'leaf', 'wind', 'husband', 'home', 'daughter', 'privileged', 'life', 'also', 'Halloran', 'fire', 'passion', 'brutality', 'uncertainty', 'life', 'time', 'war', 'Halloran', 'irresistible', 'guilt', 'infidelity', 'weigh', 'soul', 'whenever', 'not', 'Even', 'end', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'feeling', 'resolved', 'what', 'must', 'be', 'Halloran', 'really', 'most', 'unsatisfying', 'thing', 'Hanover', 'Street', 'unfinished', 'quality', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'Margaret', 'Paul', 'end', 'make', 'seem', 'more', 'uplifting.For', 'weaknesses', 'may', 'be', 'actual', 'storytelling', 'are', 'many', 'scenes', 'are', 'real', 'gems', 'scene', 'Margaret', 'Sellinger', 'daughter', 'out', 'very', 'witty', 'warm', 'dialogue', 'Halloran', 'Sellinger', 'mission', 'Nazi-occupied', 'France', 'also', 'excellent', 'beginning', 'end', 'even', 'had', 'seen', 'movie', 'was', 'still', 'edge', 'seat', 'entire', 'time', 'Hanover', 'Street', 'basically', 'story', 'how', 'love', 'one', 'woman', 'can', 'affect', 'two', 'men', 'very', 'different', 'ways', 'one', 'man', 'weak', 'other', 'man', 'strong', 'Had', 'storytelling', 'been', 'more', 'even', 'could', 'have', 'become', 'classic', 'film', 'though', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'full', 'romance', 'adventure', ""'m"", 'glad', 'was', 'able', 'see', 'again', 'years']",N/A

662489,A3R5AFKW4FP0U5,B00005LB88,SusieQ,"[1, 1]","I imagined while watching HANOVER STREET that the director wanted to make a tribute to 1940's Hollywood films, and in a few respects, he succeeded.  The opening credits of floating clouds and blue sky - the extravagant soundtrack - and the way the couple meet and fall in love ""immediately"", are all reminiscent of classic Hollywood movie romances.No one loves watching a melodramatic love story more than me - but at the very least, it's got to be well acted and well written in order to BE watchable.  Unfortunately for this love story, Harrison Ford and Lesley-Anne Down are really wooden, and their dialogue, particularly during love scenes, is embarrassingly lame.  I didn't believe for a minute that these two were madly passionate about each other - Lesley-Anne Down's face is annoyingly expressionless; she almost seems tranquilized.  Harrison Ford looks very handsome, but in 1979 he didn't have the acting ability to portray a man who's desperately in love with a woman (it really wasn't until WITNESS, in my opinion, that he gained this ability).  Also, his hair was way too long for the 1940's time period (these things bother me).  I was also distracted by the amount of visible eye makeup Lesley-Anne Down wore.HANOVER STREET is really two films:  the love story between the American pilot, David Halloran, and the British housewife/nurse's aide Margaret Sellinger, which takes up the first half; then the action film which takes over in the second half.  The second half is actually a better, more lively movie (if no more believable) mostly thanks to the acting talent of charismatic Christopher Plummer, who plays Lesley-Anne Down's intelligence agent husband.  (There are some nice supporting moments from Alec MacGowan and the young Patsy Kensit.)  Christopher Plummer, just seated on a couch talking to his little daughter, or in conference with other intelligence agents, acted rings around Lesley-Anne Down or Harrison Ford, although to give Harrison credit, once he was in France trying to escape Nazis, his character came to life.  In fact, IMO, he had more connection & charisma with Christopher Plummer than he did with Lesley-Anne Down!Another fault of the film is that, despite the air raid that happens in the first eight minutes of the film, and several scenes of Harrison Ford's character going on bombing raids, there didn't seem to be a consistent, believable, ""WWII"" aspect.  I don't think the luxurious house where Lesley-Anne Down's character lived even had blackout curtains.  And the scene where Harrison Ford's character {SPOILER ALERT} *** rescues Christopher Plummer's character from a exploding bridge, looked extraordinarily, cheaply fake. ** {END SPOILER}I was very disappointed in this film.  I'd often wondered by it never turns up on TV, and now I know why.  Even the John Barry score was over the top and clunky.

662494,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B00005LB88,Trevor Willsmer,"[3, 4]","One of the delights of DVD - even more than video - is that its insatiable desire for fresh product sees the resurrection of swathes of unloved would-be blockbusters that no self-respecting cinematheque would ever include in any retrospective and which would otherwise be left to rot in time-compressed panned-and-scanned graveyard slots on network TV just before the infomercials start. These aren't the forgotten or under-appreciated masterpieces awaiting rediscovery, but rather the misjudged, the misbegotten or the just plain mistimed, films before or after their time that never found their audience and, until the advent of DVD, would never have been given the chance.Hanover Street fits into all those categories at once. Intended both as a throwback to 1940s tearjerkers and an epic Summer event movie that would launch Harrison Ford to stardom (something that would still be another two years and a bullwhip away), it proved a major box-office failure and a source of much critical derision - not quite the Battlefield: Earth of its day, but close. It's easy to understand why, but, dammit, it is fun. Maybe not always in the ways its makers intended, but fun nonetheless.Ford is the bomber pilot with nerves of steel and no fear of death or heavy anti-aircraft fire - or at least until he falls in love with nice English girl Lesley Anne Down and starts to scrub missions because the engine never sounds quite right as he finds something to live for. To prove to himself and the various whisperers at the airbase that he's still got what it takes, he volunteers himself and his crew (including John Ratzenberger who, pre-Cheers, must have starred in almost every single US movie made in the UK from Star Wars to The Bitch) for a top secret mission over occupied territory. Naturally, it goes wrong and he finds himself behind enemy lines in Nazi-occupied territory with a British secret agent (Christopher Plummer) out to prove his courage and show himself worthy of his wife's love by stealing vital documents from the local Gestapo headquarters. Yes, you know exactly what's coming next, but that's part of the fun of this unashamedly romantic throwback to World War Two morale-boosters: the Germans are dastardly, the Brits quietly heroic, the Yanks brash but decent sorts underneath it all, the French resistance irresistible and all the clich&eacute;s are played straight as if freshly minted.Ford and Down were last-minute replacements when Kris Kristofferson and Genevieve Bujold dropped out of the picture. At the time, Ford admitted that he only took the role (his first lead) because he had never kissed a woman onscreen, which is as good an excuse as any. In the process he started a career trend of romantic flops and underachievers (Regarding Henry, Random Hearts, Sabrina, Six Days, Seven Nights), but hokey as this is - and it definitely is - this is by far the most entertaining. There's no shortage of cringingly bad dialogue (""Think of me when you drink tea"") while an infant Patsy Kensit's deeply annoying turn as Plummer and Down's sugar-sweet oh-so-perfect daughter makes Shirley Temple look like a chainsaw-wielding drug-crazed Christina Ricci and will have you cursing the poor aim of the Luftwaffe. Plummer's unutterably decent cuckolded husband also seems stuck in post-transformation Captain Von Trapp mode - you keep on expecting him to thank Down for bringing music back into his home. Yet much of the humour is intentional, Plummer has a great speech about always being the guy who gives his coat to the drowning man that someone else has rescued and, while it's not exactly hardcore gritty realism, in an age of CGI effects it's refreshing to see a film that literally rebuilds part of WW2 London (even if it does plant a non-existent tube station in Hanover Street) just to blow it all up and in which the bombers are still all real vintage aircraft rather than pixels. Now that it's firmly in the past as an old movie, what was anachronistic in 1979 almost has exactly the kind of charm it failed to weave on cinema audiences all those years ago. And hey, it's a lot more fun than Pearl Harbor.Although on his audio commentary writer-director Peter Hyams acknowledges the influence of Joseph Heller's novel, Richard Masur's dialogue isn't so much inspired by Catch-22 as lifted from it verbatim. Still, since Mike Nichols didn't use much of it in his poe-faced movie version, and since Masur has such fun with it, you can forgive them the conceit. The film even shares the same cinematographer, David Watkin, though unfortunately it's from that period in late-seventies mainstream cinema when cinematography was both soft and dominated by Earth tones, so the film never looks quite as rich as it could, and this is reflected in the 2.35:1 transfer.Sadly, Columbia have missed a trick by not including an isolated score track - a particular disappointment because John Barry has famously little regard for his lush and unashamedly romantic score and has always resisted moves to include a suite on any of his own compilations (a 5-minute suite conducted by Nic Raine is included on Silva Screen's The Classic John Barry). No trailer either, though it does include trailers for Random Hearts, The Remains of the Day and Neil Jordan's The End of the Affair.",3,Silly but highly enjoyable,1194480000,"11 8,

Although I had seen the original Star Wars movie and American Graffiti, Harrison Ford was still not a familiar face to me.  This movie, however, did more than these previous two films to cement him in my consciousness.  I was a young graduate student at the time I saw this movie, and could identify with Ford's character as a young man largely oblivious to the future.  His perspective, however, changes dramatically when he falls in love with a young married woman played by Lesley Anne Downs.  I remember that after meeting her he aborts a mission due to the vague feeling that one of the four engines of his bomber does not sound right.  In discussing this incident with Downs' character, he remarks that before meeting her he wouldn't have cared if one of the propellers had fallen off his plane--he would taken off regardless!
