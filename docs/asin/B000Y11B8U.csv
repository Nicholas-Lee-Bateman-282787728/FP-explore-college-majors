If you don't find that objectionable, then you will find the story based on facts to be informative and interesting. Some would argue that this is the real world. And to some degree I would agree; however, I cannot believe that high level business executives and lawyers have such a limited vocabulary as to depend so totally on this one expletive.",1,"One good, one not worth watching again.",1401840000,"06 4, 2014",2014,472,"['Civil', 'Action', 'well', 'done', 'not', 'offensive', 'Insider', 'F-word', 'was', 'capitalization', 'punctuation', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'objectionable', 'then', 'will', 'find', 'story', 'based', 'facts', 'be', 'informative', 'interesting', 'would', 'argue', 'real', 'world', 'degree', 'would', 'agree', 'however', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'high', 'level', 'business', 'executives', 'lawyers', 'have', 'limited', 'vocabulary', 'depend', 'so', 'totally', 'one', 'expletive']",2-PK Civil Action/Insider

I have often wondered why the main actor never received oscar mention.  I highly recommend this movie for its foray into an area and subject matter that most americans do not like to discuss.  The ending of this movie was quite interesting.,5,Review,1399334400,"05 6, 2014",2014,350,"[""'ve"", 'seen', '34', 'A', 'Civil', 'Action', '34', 'many', 'times', 'notice', 'something', 'new', 'time', 'amazing', 'movie', 'have', 'often', 'wondered', 'why', 'main', 'actor', 'never', 'received', 'oscar', 'mention', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'foray', 'area', 'subject', 'matter', 'most', 'americans', 'do', 'not', 'discuss', 'ending', 'movie', 'was', 'quite', 'interesting']",2-PK Civil Action/Insider

The performances are all first rate--John Travolta is very good as the plaintiff's attorney in A Civil Action.

1115787,A2EW64WI4R74Z8,B000Y11B8U,RestlessBoomer,"[1, 1]","This was a pretty good deal on a movie I'd seen before (but not for a long time)--A Civil Action and Insider a movie about a whistle-blower in the cigarette industry.  John Travolta starts out as an arrogant, money-hungry lawyer who ends up actually having a heart when he represents people who are fighting for their very lives against a company who could care less about the havoc they're wreaking on a small town.  It will make you angry because you know this has happened before, is still happening and will continue to happen as long as people put money before others' welfare.In The Insider, Russell Crowe does a good job of playing the whistle blower who's life starts falling apart when he tries to do the right thing.  Al Pacino (not one of my favorite actors) is actually quite good in his role as the reporter who works with Crowe to expose the cigarette industry.All in all, a pretty good double-feature for the money.",4,Good double feature,1369785600,"05 29, 2013",2013,930,"['was', 'pretty', 'good', 'deal', 'movie', ""'d"", 'seen', 'not', 'long', 'time', 'Civil', 'Action', 'Insider', 'movie', 'whistle-blower', 'cigarette', 'industry', 'John', 'Travolta', 'out', 'arrogant', 'money-hungry', 'lawyer', 'who', 'up', 'actually', 'having', 'heart', 'when', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'fighting', 'very', 'company', 'who', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'havoc', ""'re"", 'wreaking', 'small', 'town', 'will', 'make', 'angry', 'know', 'happened', 'still', 'happening', 'will', 'continue', 'happen', 'as', 'long', 'people', 'put', 'money', 'others', 'welfare.In', 'Insider', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'good', 'job', 'playing', 'whistle', 'blower', 'who', 'life', 'falling', 'apart', 'when', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'not', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'role', 'reporter', 'who', 'Crowe', 'expose', 'cigarette', 'industry.All', 'pretty', 'good', 'double-feature', 'money']",2-PK Civil Action/Insider
