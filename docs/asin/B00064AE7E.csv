I still can't get enough of it. Looking thru the inside of the real Marshall Mathers before he became Eminem or Slim Shady filled with trials, tribulations, turmoil, death situations, and so much happening and how he rose to be one of the true geniuses in the rap industry today. He's by no means stands as a true living poet with much dignity, love, encouragement, heartfelt and pride. There's nobody else that can sound like him. If you ever seen the movie8 Mile (Full Screen Edition), you can tell the real deal how he got his inspiration from.Nice interviews from friends and family members who got to know him better. The bonus features are worth the pick on this DVD.No matter whether you hate him, dislike him or the other, he is what he is. You can't deny that. RIP to Eminem's Uncles Todd Nelson, Em's best friend and protege Proof, and his sidekick Ronnie whom changed Eminem's life.Still the best documentary seen so far.",5,Overall the best documentary ever done on Eminem,1296259200,"01 29, 2011",2011,1029,"['doubt', 'mind', 'DVD', 'incredible', 'documentary', 'would', 'be', 'down', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'Looking', 'inside', 'real', 'Marshall', 'Mathers', 'became', 'Eminem', 'Slim', 'Shady', 'filled', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'turmoil', 'death', 'situations', 'so', 'much', 'happening', 'how', 'rose', 'be', 'one', 'true', 'geniuses', 'rap', 'industry', 'today', 'means', 'true', 'living', 'poet', 'much', 'dignity', 'love', 'encouragement', 'heartfelt', 'pride', 'nobody', 'else', 'can', 'sound', 'ever', 'seen', 'movie8', 'Mile', 'Full', 'Screen', 'Edition', 'can', 'tell', 'real', 'deal', 'how', 'got', 'inspiration', 'from.Nice', 'interviews', 'friends', 'family', 'members', 'who', 'got', 'know', 'better', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'pick', 'DVD.No', 'matter', 'hate', 'other', 'what', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deny', 'RIP', 'Eminem', 'Uncles', 'Todd', 'Nelson', 'Em', 'best', 'friend', 'protege', 'Proof', 'sidekick', 'Ronnie', 'whom', 'changed', 'Eminem', 'life.Still', 'best', 'documentary', 'seen', 'so', 'far']",N/A

Just messin' with you MM.I'm not really into rap since my therapist took me off the meds and I had to stop smokin' over 30 years ago. And I can't really say I miss the year I spent in the Detroit cold ... mainly because I can't really remember much of it due to all the alcohol there, and the fact that I had to leave so fast ... (long story).Anyway, that said, this is one of the most down to earth, true-to-life feelin' rapumentary's I've ever seen. I don't know how much if it is really real, but the message seems genuine - that is, the man struggled to exorcise his demons the best way he knew how.Despite the fact that the fake world kept tellin him it was he who wasn't real, he kept to his work and made it to the next level. The money level.Slim, if you're reading this, and I hope you are, you know that the next level is not 'the end'. That it's only peaceful for a little while before the craziness begins again.Just remember that some of us struggle with you, and that when the new s... starts to seem just as bad as the old s... - go to what you know ... writin tiny words from the heart that have huge meaning.I don't remember who said it, but ""all writers are meant to struggle"", keep strugglin bro. Maybe I'll get to Motor City to see you perform before my days are up. Gonna take a long time to save up for all those party favorites though.Thank you for the fine work. Keep your head up.Definitely a must see for Em lovers & haters alike. Enjoy.
