This performance clearly shows his amazing talent, although it is a bit more subdued than some of his more recent performances.  I often refer to Tommy's style as Kamakazi finger style.  That is usually pretty close.  On this DVD, he seemed to be a little more conventional, but still displays his amazing gift.",5,Tommy Emmanuel is as good as they come.,1285200000,"09 23, 2010",2010,433,"['have', 'ever', 'heard', 'Tommy', 'Emmanuel', 'know', 'one', 'most', 'accomplished', 'finger', 'style', 'guitarists', 'world', 'performance', 'clearly', 'amazing', 'talent', 'bit', 'more', 'subdued', 'more', 'recent', 'performances', 'often', 'refer', 'Tommy', 'style', 'Kamakazi', 'finger', 'style', 'usually', 'pretty', 'close', 'DVD', 'seemed', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'conventional', 'still', 'amazing', 'gift']",N/A
993962,A36EW68H08UOCS,B000FPYNV2,"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[0, 1]","I saw an interview with the great Braves trio of pitchers about ten years ago - Greg Maddux, John Smoltz, Tom Glavine gathered with their seven Cy Young Awards to talk about being teammates and comparing things like golfing ability and who had the most devastating pitch.  It's pretty common knowledge that Maddux has one of the best change-ups in history, but Maddux himself said that Smoltz has a ""Bugs Bunny"" fastball.I knew exactly what he meant - a pitch so fast and with so much movement and delivered with a smirk on the side of his face that it just simply overmatches hitters.That's the way Tommy Emmanuel plays guitar - with superhuman speed and dexterity, but also with a Bugs Bunny smirk at the same time - not a smirk at the audience, but a smirk WITH the audience, as in ""aren't we having a good time here?!""A few of the cuts from ""Live at Her Majesty's Theatre"" are available on-line in places like Tommy's website and youtube, but I'd say it's worth seeing the whole concert.There are a few vocals, from Tommy and from fianc&eacute;e Elizabeth Watkins, and although a few other reviewers point out that they're not exactly Sinatra and Ella, complaining about their singing is like going to see Tiger Woods at the Masters and complaining that there were some other people playing golf too.Emmanuel strums and bangs and caresses and frankly gets about as many interesting sounds out of a six-string acoustic as anyone.  His repertoire is varied and entertaining - Chet Atkins to Classical Gas, Beatles to Merle Travis, plus original compositions that are as good as anything else he plays.  If you don't like the tune he's doing right now - just wait a minute, he'll be playing something different.Plus - he plays guitar like a cross between Chet Atkins and Bugs Bunny.",5,The Bugs Bunny of Acoustic Guitar DVDs,1234828800,"02 17, 2009",2009,1783,"['saw', 'interview', 'great', 'Braves', 'trio', 'pitchers', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'Greg', 'Maddux', 'John', 'Smoltz', 'Tom', 'Glavine', 'gathered', 'seven', 'Cy', 'Young', 'Awards', 'talk', 'being', 'teammates', 'comparing', 'things', 'golfing', 'ability', 'who', 'had', 'most', 'devastating', 'pitch', 'pretty', 'common', 'knowledge', 'Maddux', 'one', 'best', 'change-ups', 'history', 'Maddux', 'said', 'Smoltz', 'Bugs', 'Bunny', 'fastball.I', 'knew', 'exactly', 'what', 'meant', 'pitch', 'fast', 'so', 'much', 'movement', 'delivered', 'smirk', 'side', 'face', 'just', 'simply', 'way', 'Tommy', 'Emmanuel', 'guitar', 'superhuman', 'speed', 'dexterity', 'also', 'Bugs', 'Bunny', 'smirk', 'same', 'time', 'not', 'smirk', 'audience', 'smirk', 'WITH', 'audience', 'are', ""n't"", 'having', 'good', 'time', 'here', 'A', 'few', 'cuts', 'Live', 'Her', 'Majesty', 'Theatre', 'are', 'available', 'on-line', 'places', 'Tommy', 'website', 'youtube', ""'d"", 'say', 'worth', 'seeing', 'whole', 'are', 'few', 'vocals', 'Tommy', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Elizabeth', 'Watkins', 'few', 'other', 'reviewers', 'point', 'out', ""'re"", 'not', 'exactly', 'Sinatra', 'Ella', 'complaining', 'singing', 'going', 'see', 'Tiger', 'Woods', 'Masters', 'complaining', 'were', 'other', 'people', 'playing', 'golf', 'too.Emmanuel', 'strums', 'bangs', 'caresses', 'frankly', 'about', 'many', 'interesting', 'six-string', 'acoustic', 'anyone', 'repertoire', 'varied', 'entertaining', 'Chet', 'Classical', 'Gas', 'Beatles', 'Merle', 'Travis', 'original', 'compositions', 'are', 'as', 'good', 'anything', 'else', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'tune', 'doing', 'right', 'now', 'just', 'wait', 'minute', ""'ll"", 'be', 'playing', 'something', 'different.Plus', 'guitar', 'cross', 'Chet', 'Atkins', 'Bugs', 'Bunny']",N/A

This DVD has him singing too  many songs and  a guest female vocalist on at least 4 numbers....I allmost feel its misleading to not have her name on the front of the DVD!There are many better singers in the world...few better guitarists...stop singing and play!,2,too much singing!!  the Mel Bay DVD is far superior...IMHO,1151452800,"06 28, 2006",2006,448,"['love', 'Tommy', 'Emmanuel..but', 'previously', 'released', 'DVD', 'concert', 'much', 'more', 'liking', 'Tommy', 'playing', 'great', 'repetoire', 'standards', 'originals', 'nobody', 'else', 'world', 'DVD', 'singing', 'too', 'many', 'songs', 'guest', 'female', 'vocalist', 'least', '4', 'numbers', 'allmost', 'feel', 'misleading', 'not', 'have', 'name', 'front', 'DVD', 'are', 'many', 'better', 'singers', 'world', 'few', 'better', 'guitarists', 'stop', 'singing', 'play']",N/A
