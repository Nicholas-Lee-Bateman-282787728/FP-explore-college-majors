If you want to watch a decent post Vietnam movie there are many others better than this. But it's fairly funny in a childish way. Sally Field and Harrison Ford were in this movie when they were young so if you want to see them in their prime this may be a good movie for you. If you've got a couple bucks to spare it may be worth buying. It is in HD which was good considering when it came out.,3,"Not the best, not the worst",1389052800,"01 7, 2014",2014,473,"['Heroes', 'decent', 'movie', 'Henry', 'Winkler', 'acted', 'little', 'too', 'goofy', 'taste', 'want', 'watch', 'decent', 'post', 'Vietnam', 'movie', 'are', 'many', 'others', 'better', 'fairly', 'funny', 'childish', 'way', 'Sally', 'Field', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'were', 'movie', 'when', 'were', 'young', 'so', 'want', 'see', 'prime', 'may', 'be', 'good', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'got', 'couple', 'bucks', 'spare', 'may', 'be', 'worth', 'buying', 'HD', 'was', 'good', 'considering', 'when', 'came', 'out']",N/A

It's blunted and trivialized somewhat by the replacement of ""Carry On Wayward Son"" by Kansas with a generic rock song over the end credits.  The reason I have a fond memory of that song is because of this movie, so to see  the ending altered in such a crude way is somewhat upsetting.  However, the movie itself is still worth a look for a flawed but interesting and risky performance by Henry Winkler, and good supporting roles by Sally Field and Harrison Ford before both became the respected Hollywood actors they are now.  The movie as a whole is hit and miss, but its depiction of PTSD I think is fairly accurate, though the subject was better handled some years later in Peter Weir's Fearless.",3,Ending Blunted By Generic Replacement of Kansas Song,1214524800,"06 27, 2008",2008,855,"['ending', 'movie', 'always', 'been', 'etched', 'memory', 'one', 'most', 'harrowing', 'depictions', 'what', 'would', 'later', 'be', 'called', 'PTSD', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'blunted', 'trivialized', 'somewhat', 'replacement', 'Carry', 'Wayward', 'Son', 'Kansas', 'generic', 'rock', 'song', 'end', 'credits', 'reason', 'have', 'fond', 'memory', 'song', 'movie', 'so', 'see', 'ending', 'altered', 'such', 'crude', 'way', 'somewhat', 'upsetting', 'However', 'movie', 'still', 'worth', 'look', 'flawed', 'interesting', 'risky', 'performance', 'Henry', 'Winkler', 'good', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Sally', 'Field', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'became', 'respected', 'Hollywood', 'actors', 'are', 'now', 'movie', 'whole', 'hit', 'miss', 'depiction', 'PTSD', 'think', 'fairly', 'accurate', 'subject', 'was', 'better', 'handled', 'years', 'later', 'Peter', 'Weir', 'Fearless']",N/A

204677,A1CK5G1VZ7QDRD,6300184102,A. Thurston,"[0, 0]",I recall seeing this as a teen at the drive in and not realizing that Henry Winkler was the same guy who played the Fonz on Happy Days. In other words he looked a lot different in Heroes than on tv .This film is one of those it feels like the 70's and that's a good thing in my book.I have a great deal of respect for films made in that era both big budget and exploitation. Anyways the story is really well done you will relate to the 2 main characters stressed out possibly crazy  Vietnam vet Jack played by Winkler and his at first foil then later lover Carol played by the wonderful Sally Field.I have always had a soft spot for Sally Field and appreciate many of the films she did along the way. Jack is a loose cannon being held at a V.A. in NYC for those who suffered mental or physical  issues due to being in Vietnam. He has a plan he and his fellow platoon mates want to start a worm farm in Eureka California where one of the men was from. So in his quest to get together with the gang he plots an escape from the hospital.A grand chase through 70's downtown Manhattan ensues and Jack finally eludes his would be captors. Jack makes it to the Penn Station Bus terminal and using his meager funds purchases a bus ticket to Kansas City where he's to meet one of his old mates.But the bus is overbooked and Jack is left to fight with Carol over the last ticket.Carol is going to wed an old flame but is getting cold feet and wants to take off and be free to figure things out. So somehow Jack manages to bribe his way onto the bus even though there's no seat available. He then proceeds to torture both Carol and the bus driver Mel for most of the duration of the trip. Carol is wary of the eccentric Jack and his ways are whacky but generally harmless.Jack also has a bunch of worms with him as a starter kit so to speak.Eventually Carol softens on jack and they end up together stranded in Kansas City.There Jack gets together with the first platoon member played by Harrison Ford. Here we start to see the toll that Vietnam took on these men's psyches .Harrison's character is a do nothing slob who owns a race car but is afraid to race it.He also was to have raised some rabbits for the worm farm as rabbit pellets are good nutrients for worms. While Jack is high energy and hyper his buddy is the opposite lethargic and sour. This is an omen for the rest of the film as Jack and Carol go in search of the rest of the guys and find out that things are not well with any of them. The climatic scene at the last house in Eureka is outstanding and the acting of Winkler and Field is off the charts good. I won't raise a fuss about the film makers decision to not pay the band Kansas royalties to use their hit song Carry On (Wayward Son) .I mean any classic rock station across the country plays that song as a staple anyhow. My only quibble is that the film could have been edited tighter as it runs near 2 hours and there's a good 15-20 minutes of tedious action that could have been edited out without hurting the story. If you are like me and like 70's cinema.like both Winkler and Field and want a movie that is both funny and sad then I recommend Heroes it's an under the radar gem.,4,Vintage 70's feature film,1362614400,"03 7, 2013",2013,3197,"['recall', 'seeing', 'teen', 'drive', 'not', 'realizing', 'Henry', 'Winkler', 'was', 'same', 'guy', 'who', 'played', 'Fonz', 'Happy', 'Days', 'other', 'words', 'looked', 'lot', 'different', 'Heroes', 'tv', '.This', 'film', 'one', '70', 'good', 'thing', 'book.I', 'have', 'great', 'deal', 'respect', 'films', 'made', 'era', 'big', 'budget', 'exploitation', 'story', 'really', 'well', 'done', 'will', 'relate', '2', 'main', 'characters', 'stressed', 'out', 'possibly', 'crazy', 'Vietnam', 'vet', 'Jack', 'played', 'Winkler', 'first', 'foil', 'then', 'later', 'lover', 'Carol', 'played', 'wonderful', 'Sally', 'Field.I', 'have', 'always', 'had', 'soft', 'spot', 'Sally', 'Field', 'appreciate', 'many', 'films', 'did', 'along', 'way', 'Jack', 'loose', 'cannon', 'being', 'held', 'V.A', 'NYC', 'who', 'suffered', 'mental', 'physical', 'issues', 'due', 'being', 'Vietnam', 'plan', 'fellow', 'platoon', 'mates', 'want', 'start', 'worm', 'farm', 'Eureka', 'California', 'where', 'one', 'men', 'was', 'So', 'quest', 'get', 'together', 'gang', 'escape', 'hospital.A', 'grand', 'chase', '70', 'downtown', 'Manhattan', 'ensues', 'Jack', 'finally', 'would', 'be', 'captors', 'Jack', 'Penn', 'Station', 'Bus', 'terminal', 'using', 'meager', 'funds', 'purchases', 'bus', 'ticket', 'Kansas', 'City', 'where', 'meet', 'one', 'old', 'mates.But', 'bus', 'overbooked', 'Jack', 'left', 'fight', 'Carol', 'last', 'ticket.Carol', 'going', 'wed', 'old', 'flame', 'getting', 'cold', 'feet', 'take', 'off', 'be', 'free', 'figure', 'things', 'out', 'So', 'somehow', 'Jack', 'bribe', 'way', 'bus', 'even', 'seat', 'available', 'then', 'torture', 'Carol', 'bus', 'driver', 'Mel', 'most', 'duration', 'trip', 'Carol', 'wary', 'eccentric', 'Jack', 'ways', 'are', 'whacky', 'generally', 'harmless.Jack', 'also', 'bunch', 'worms', 'starter', 'kit', 'so', 'speak.Eventually', 'Carol', 'jack', 'end', 'up', 'together', 'stranded', 'Kansas', 'City.There', 'Jack', 'together', 'first', 'platoon', 'member', 'played', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Here', 'start', 'see', 'toll', 'Vietnam', 'took', 'men', 'psyches', '.Harrison', 'character', 'do', 'nothing', 'slob', 'who', 'race', 'car', 'afraid', 'race', 'it.He', 'also', 'was', 'have', 'raised', 'rabbits', 'worm', 'farm', 'rabbit', 'pellets', 'are', 'good', 'nutrients', 'worms', 'Jack', 'high', 'energy', 'hyper', 'buddy', 'opposite', 'lethargic', 'sour', 'omen', 'rest', 'film', 'Jack', 'Carol', 'go', 'search', 'rest', 'guys', 'find', 'out', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'well', 'climatic', 'scene', 'last', 'house', 'Eureka', 'outstanding', 'acting', 'Winkler', 'Field', 'charts', 'good', 'wo', ""n't"", 'raise', 'fuss', 'film', 'makers', 'decision', 'not', 'pay', 'band', 'Kansas', 'royalties', 'use', 'hit', 'song', 'Carry', 'Wayward', 'Son', '.I', 'mean', 'classic', 'rock', 'station', 'country', 'song', 'staple', 'anyhow', 'only', 'quibble', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'edited', 'tighter', '2', 'hours', 'good', '15-20', 'minutes', 'tedious', 'action', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'edited', 'out', 'hurting', 'story', 'are', '70', 'cinema.like', 'Winkler', 'Field', 'want', 'movie', 'funny', 'sad', 'then', 'recommend', 'radar', 'gem']",N/A

The ending with the Kansas song &#34;Carry On Wayward Son&#34; gives you one of those rare moments when you have goosebumps from head to toe. The second that acapella parts begins, I always get an immediate lump in my throat and the tears well up in my head. Knowing all too well the trauma that so many veterans came home with, especially from Viet Nam, this movie took that and made it just funny enough for it not to be a complete bummer of a movie to watch and kept the poignant truth behind PTSD, which at the time wasn't talked about much like it is now. That particular song at the end...the sublime placement of it....that was the money shot. I had always  loved that song anyway, but lyrically, it never hit me the way it did in this movie. To release it without that song is a travesty and I can only assume it has to either be a licensing issue or for some reason, Kansas decided not to make their song available any longer (can't imagine why). So, for that reason alone, I won't purchase this DVD. I'm kicking myself in the ass for throwing away the video tape I had of it, which I believe I taped off of HBO back in the 70's when I first got a VCR. It had the ending complete with the song. But, stupid me threw it away only because the quality of a 40+ year VHS tape left a lot to be desired. I hate when this crap happens!! I only hope whatever the problem is/was gets resolved, so they can restore the film to what it once was. It looks like the exclusion of the song is the #1 complaint given out of all the reviews given. So, my 5 star rating is based on the film itself, not the DVD release. The original version of the movie is ingrained in my memory and retains it's high rating. Thanks everyone for letting the world know.
