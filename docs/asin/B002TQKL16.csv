He is a practical man, that doesn't know how to hide his feeling and expresses them even if they are hurtful, actually, this is a good kind, because most people nowadays are two faces.This show is funny, and the chemistry between the characters is strong and makes it even funnier.Season 3 starts off with ""The Film Critic""; which is funny and talks mostly about movie theaters and how people can't seem to find peace there. The season ends off when Becker tries to help his patient and advices him to go to the gym and even goes with him, but the patient has a heart attack and instead of thanking Becker he sues him, and Becker's practice would seem to be on it's way to end.You've gotta love this season, it digs deep into the relations between the characters, Bob becomes the Super and Reggie dating experience and Margret's husband relation.I miss those Sitcom days, where every episode used to be funny.Long live Becker.",5,The show that changed many of our lives,1272931200,"05 4, 2010",2010,996,"['think', 'Becker', 'show', 'appreciation', 'angel', 'practical', 'man', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'hide', 'feeling', 'even', 'are', 'hurtful', 'actually', 'good', 'kind', 'most', 'people', 'nowadays', 'are', 'two', 'faces.This', 'show', 'funny', 'chemistry', 'characters', 'strong', 'even', 'funnier.Season', '3', 'starts', 'Film', 'Critic', 'funny', 'talks', 'mostly', 'movie', 'theaters', 'how', 'people', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'find', 'peace', 'there', 'season', 'off', 'when', 'Becker', 'help', 'patient', 'go', 'gym', 'even', 'patient', 'heart', 'attack', 'instead', 'thanking', 'Becker', 'Becker', 'practice', 'would', 'seem', 'be', 'way', 'end.You', ""'ve"", 'got', 'ta', 'love', 'season', 'deep', 'relations', 'characters', 'Bob', 'Super', 'Reggie', 'dating', 'experience', 'Margret', 'husband', 'relation.I', 'miss', 'Sitcom', 'days', 'where', 'episode', 'used', 'be', 'funny.Long', 'live', 'Becker']",Becker: Season 3
