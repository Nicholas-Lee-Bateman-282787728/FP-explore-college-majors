980616,A1JZUI3JE5CKVT,B000EXZFSK,Johan Peter,"[3, 3]","I purchased this DVD in the beginning of this year [2007] and -lucky me- the former incompleteness was already corrected. I watched this miniseries about fifteen years ago and I never forgot the brilliant performance of Patrick Dempsey as the young Jack Kennedy. Since then the two are inseparable in my perception of JFK and I have been quite amazed for a long, long time that Dempsey didn't reach star-status or at least became a sex-symbol. Of course this is history now since the succes of Grey's Anatomy and he acquired both, strangely enough at roughly the same age that JFK became president...I believe that this production paints also one of the most accurate pictures of the [Joe and Rose] Kennedy household that I have ever seen: a strange blend of conservatism and modernism, freedom and discipline. Probably some of the ingredients that made the future president, his wife and brother such enigmatic and fascinating personalities.Thumbs up for the wardrobe-department too: the clothing of the individual characters is impeccable and completely in line with the period.",5,Patrick Dempsey's JFK,1195689600,"11 22, 2007",2007,1080,"['purchased', 'DVD', 'beginning', 'year', '[', '2007', ']', '-lucky', 'me-', 'former', 'incompleteness', 'was', 'already', 'corrected', 'watched', 'miniseries', 'fifteen', 'years', 'ago', 'never', 'forgot', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'Patrick', 'Dempsey', 'young', 'Jack', 'Kennedy', 'then', 'two', 'are', 'inseparable', 'perception', 'JFK', 'have', 'been', 'quite', 'amazed', 'long', 'long', 'time', 'Dempsey', 'did', ""n't"", 'reach', 'star-status', 'least', 'became', 'sex-symbol', 'course', 'history', 'now', 'succes', 'Grey', 'Anatomy', 'acquired', 'strangely', 'enough', 'roughly', 'same', 'age', 'JFK', 'became', 'president', 'believe', 'production', 'paints', 'also', 'one', 'most', 'accurate', 'pictures', '[', 'Joe', 'Rose', ']', 'Kennedy', 'household', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'strange', 'blend', 'conservatism', 'modernism', 'freedom', 'discipline', 'Probably', 'ingredients', 'made', 'future', 'president', 'wife', 'brother', 'such', 'enigmatic', 'fascinating', 'personalities.Thumbs', 'up', 'wardrobe-department', 'too', 'clothing', 'individual', 'characters', 'impeccable', 'completely', 'line', 'period']",N/A

I open the box to insert disk 2 and there wasn't one. I got online to return the DVD and also emailed the distributor. Unfortunately, it was Friday evening.This is the response I received Monday morning:Dear RuthThank you for your purchase of JFK Reckless Youth.The film that you purchased aired on television as a 2 part miniseries, and the disc was replicated in that same 2 part format..The miniseries will play and as it nears the end of the first   it will appear as though the film is over, run credits, blank 2-5 second screen shot ect.  However, if you let the DVD continue to play , the opening credit will again appear (as they did at the first  of the film) and then the DVD will pick up with the second half of the film.You could also access the second  using  the scene selection option from your main menu. This should allow you to determine where the second half of the miniseries starts. Select that scene and the story will continue.If you continue to have problems with the DVD please feel free to reply to this email with question or concerns or call 608.784.6620.One of our customer service representatives will be happy to help you.Sincerely,EBHE Customer ServiceIT WORKED!!! I watched the second half and thought, I wasted all this time and energy for this?  For ME a three star rating is too high because of MY EXPECTATIONS. I wanted to see a story about a RECKLESS YOUTH. This was more like any other documentary. Which I had just watched 3 other documentaries prior. If I was expecting a documentary I would have rated it 5 stars. As a fictional movie with drama, excitement and RECKLESSNESS - one star.",3,"Wonderful documentary, boring fictional movie - instructions for 2nd half",1324944000,"12 27, 2011",2011,1735,"['watched', 'first', 'half', 'was', 'just', 'looking', 'something', 'worth', 'watching', 'was', 'happening', 'ended', 'open', 'box', 'insert', 'disk', '2', 'was', ""n't"", 'one', 'got', 'online', 'return', 'DVD', 'also', 'emailed', 'distributor', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'Friday', 'evening.This', 'response', 'received', 'Monday', 'morning', 'Dear', 'RuthThank', 'purchase', 'JFK', 'Reckless', 'Youth.The', 'film', 'purchased', 'aired', 'television', '2', 'part', 'miniseries', 'disc', 'was', 'replicated', 'same', '2', 'part', 'format..The', 'miniseries', 'will', 'play', 'end', 'first', 'will', 'appear', 'film', 'run', 'credits', 'blank', '2-5', 'second', 'screen', 'shot', 'ect', 'However', 'let', 'DVD', 'continue', 'play', 'opening', 'credit', 'will', 'again', 'appear', 'did', 'first', 'film', 'then', 'DVD', 'will', 'pick', 'up', 'second', 'half', 'film.You', 'could', 'also', 'access', 'second', 'using', 'scene', 'selection', 'option', 'main', 'menu', 'should', 'allow', 'determine', 'where', 'second', 'half', 'miniseries', 'Select', 'scene', 'story', 'will', 'continue.If', 'continue', 'have', 'problems', 'DVD', 'please', 'feel', 'free', 'reply', 'email', 'question', 'concerns', 'call', '608.784.6620.One', 'customer', 'service', 'representatives', 'will', 'be', 'happy', 'help', 'you.Sincerely', 'EBHE', 'Customer', 'ServiceIT', 'WORKED', 'watched', 'second', 'half', 'thought', 'wasted', 'time', 'energy', 'ME', 'three', 'star', 'rating', 'too', 'high', 'MY', 'EXPECTATIONS', 'wanted', 'see', 'story', 'RECKLESS', 'YOUTH', 'was', 'more', 'other', 'documentary', 'Which', 'had', 'just', 'watched', '3', 'other', 'documentaries', 'prior', 'was', 'expecting', 'documentary', 'would', 'have', 'rated', '5', 'stars', 'fictional', 'movie', 'drama', 'excitement', 'RECKLESSNESS', 'one', 'star']",N/A
