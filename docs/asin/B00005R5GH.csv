677960,A31ELTOVZM5JHR,B00005R5GH,C. Rothlind,"[0, 0]","Paul Cox's ""Lonely Hearts"" should appeal to anyone who enjoys watching the tragi-comedy of two adults with diminished expectations in search of intimacy. It's the tale of two resigned souls' off-kilter and tentative encounterings; a piano-tuner running out of time (and hair), and a case of arrested development striking out on her own and discovering fear and enchantment in the unlikeliest of partners to the chagrin of over-protective parents.There is subtlety at work: a deftness of touch and timing, as well as a consistently well-judged understatement that leaves plenty of time to register off-beat events and intimately observed characterizations. There's quirkiness in play, but it's embedded in a disarming straight-forwardness. Nothing is played for laughs, but I found myself smirking with delight at the authenticity of the proceedings. A charming and profound film impossible not to love.",5,Stuggling to Connect,1358208000,"01 15, 2013",2013,902,"['Paul', 'Cox', 'Lonely', 'Hearts', 'should', 'appeal', 'anyone', 'who', 'watching', 'tragi-comedy', 'two', 'adults', 'diminished', 'expectations', 'search', 'intimacy', 'tale', 'two', 'resigned', 'souls', 'off-kilter', 'tentative', 'encounterings', 'piano-tuner', 'running', 'time', 'hair', 'case', 'arrested', 'development', 'striking', 'out', 'own', 'discovering', 'fear', 'enchantment', 'unlikeliest', 'partners', 'chagrin', 'over-protective', 'parents.There', 'subtlety', 'work', 'deftness', 'touch', 'timing', 'as', 'well', 'consistently', 'well-judged', 'understatement', 'plenty', 'time', 'register', 'off-beat', 'events', 'intimately', 'observed', 'characterizations', 'quirkiness', 'play', 'embedded', 'disarming', 'straight-forwardness', 'Nothing', 'played', 'laughs', 'found', 'smirking', 'delight', 'authenticity', 'proceedings', 'charming', 'profound', 'film', 'impossible', 'not', 'love']",N/A

677964,AGVWTYW0ULXHT,B00005R5GH,"Nathan Andersen ""Gadget lover and author of S...","[2, 2]","This is a very simple film about two fairly simple people who find that love is never so simple.  Norman Kaye plays a 49 year old piano tuner who, following his mother's death, attempts to meet someone through a arranged dating service.  He is introduced to a much younger woman, who as a result of domineering parents has come to isolate herself from others and to fear intimacy.  The ultimate outcome is fairly predictable (while remaining open-ended in the way of life, and against the grain of standard Hollywood films that like to tie everything up neatly at the end), but the director has chosen to satisfy the basic demands of the romantic comedy while avoiding both cliche and melodrama.  The result is a set of fine and subtle performances, and a light and easy style that nevertheless does not shy away from frank depictions of the neuroses that each of us possesses but can rarely face up to, and depicts the inescapably sexual dimension of relationships both directly and with sensitivity, neither aiming to exploit the characters or titillate the audience.  In many ways this reminded me of the films of Cassavettes -- though the film feels a bit less epic and overwhelming than most of Cassavettes film, it is slightly more optimistic without being false.",4,Well-made film about ordinary people falling in love,1165968000,"12 13, 2006",2006,1269,"['very', 'simple', 'film', 'two', 'fairly', 'simple', 'people', 'who', 'find', 'love', 'never', 'so', 'simple', 'Norman', 'Kaye', '49', 'year', 'old', 'piano', 'tuner', 'who', 'following', 'mother', 'death', 'attempts', 'meet', 'someone', 'arranged', 'dating', 'service', 'introduced', 'much', 'younger', 'woman', 'who', 'result', 'domineering', 'parents', 'come', 'isolate', 'others', 'fear', 'intimacy', 'ultimate', 'outcome', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'remaining', 'open-ended', 'way', 'life', 'grain', 'standard', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'like', 'tie', 'everything', 'up', 'neatly', 'end', 'director', 'chosen', 'satisfy', 'basic', 'demands', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'avoiding', 'cliche', 'melodrama', 'result', 'set', 'fine', 'subtle', 'performances', 'light', 'easy', 'style', 'nevertheless', 'not', 'shy', 'away', 'frank', 'depictions', 'neuroses', 'possesses', 'can', 'rarely', 'face', 'up', 'inescapably', 'sexual', 'dimension', 'relationships', 'directly', 'sensitivity', 'aiming', 'exploit', 'characters', 'titillate', 'audience', 'many', 'ways', 'reminded', 'films', 'Cassavettes', 'film', 'bit', 'less', 'epic', 'overwhelming', 'most', 'Cassavettes', 'film', 'slightly', 'more', 'optimistic', 'being', 'false']",N/A

677968,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B00005R5GH,Z Hayes,"[1, 1]","Norman Kaye plays Peter, an eccentric single piano tuner who is approaching 50 and has just lost his mother. He turns to a dating service to meet women and is paired up with a lonely back clerk, Patricia [Wendy Hughes] and they hit it off from their first date. These two are so suited to each other despite the age discrepancy [Patricia is much younger than Peter], yet they share many similar interests that keep them connected - music, theatre, even a night of geriatric bingo bonds them. Yet the romance is not without troubles - Patticia is sexually repressed, probably an outcome of being a single child with domineering parents and has only recently broken away from her parents by moving into her own place. Yet, her parents continually try to interfere in her life and drive her up the wall as she strives for normalcy in her love life. She turns to her therapist to sort out her sexual intimacy issues and Peter tries to be patient with her, though without much success.Ultimately, Lonely Hearts is a story of two lonely, nice people who have spent so much of their lives being good children [Peter towards his mother, and Patricia towards her parents] that they yearn for freedom - to be their own person, with their own lives and to be able to love freely. The two leads are amazing in their performances. Norman Kaye [who also composed the score for the movie] is perfect as the eccentric yet tender-hearted Peter. There is a really funny scene where he pretends to be blind at a client's place, and she escorts him out to the gate, where he promptly gets into his car and drives off! The expression on the client's face was simply priceless! Patricia as played by Wendy Hughes is well-cast as well - her Patricia is emotionally vulnerable with her pain showing through so clearly as to make us very sympathetic towards her character.This is a beautiful movie that will appeal to those who like a solid drama with humor and poignancy in it.
