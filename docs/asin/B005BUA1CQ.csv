The most that I've seen was a few seconds of one episode where Wendy used her wand when I was three or four years old and at a barber's place when me and my dad was waiting for a chair by the table where the magazines were and among them was one or two Casper comics where I saw a drawing of Casper in stipple lines as an indication of him being invisible, also when I was about four to six years old and that's all. You can't compare Marvel and DC's superhero comics and cartoons with these cartoons and comics. These cartoons and comics have no violence of anykind and sci-fi stuff like the existence of superpowers and creations of monsters with superpowers and a single big superhero with some kind of secret identity and a ridiculous costume that suddenly appears out of nowhere and comes to the rescue for all the people in an entire city. These Casper shows and books are like all the Disney shorts and Tom and Jerry shorts. It's for all to enjoy. Those were the cartoons that was made by professionals who knew where the line was drawn and none of them even thought once of coming up with those violent above and beyond natural possibilities. I ordered the complete collection of 1945-1963 and I enjoyed them all very much. I'm 33 and I never get tired of such cartoon shows nomatter how many times I watch them. I'll always watch these shows because I enjoy and love them.

Compared to other cartoons of any era, they hold up as masterpieces, but,The first episode starts with Casper being sad because he doesn't having any friends, tying a rope attached to a rock around his neck, and throwing the rock and himself off the dock.  In a later episode a skunk also tries to kill himself for similar reasons.  I have only seen about six episodes so far, so I have no idea how many suicide attempts are on these DVDs.Long story short be careful if you're buying this to show to children.  Watch it yourself first and you can decide if it's appropriate and be ready to answer some questions.",4,Suicide warning!

Luckily, this was not the case with Casper.The artwork is absolutely beautiful in the early to mid 50s cartoons and though Casper could be cheesy at times, the cartoons still retain their warmth and happiness. It was fun to see the New Casper Cartoon openings which I remembered from my childhood.

1452821,AJZNG7JD7AZ0R,B005BUA1CQ,"Mark Arnold ""movie/tv, comic book and animati...","[87, 91]","So I received my advanced copy of the ""Casper"" DVD that I did commentaries and interviews for. Overall, I give the set high marks with some minor quibbles that I had no control over.On the plus side, the set looks good. There are two slimline case clamshells; one featuring the two theatrical discs and the third disc in its own case features all of the ""New Casper Cartoon Show"" episodes.The 20-page full-color booklet looks fantastic and of course, it was written by yours truly, so it is crammed with tons of information including where every episode appears in comic books, when applicable.The first three Casper cartoons that are now in the public domain are actually featured as bonus features of disc one. There are 10 commentaries strewn throughout. All feature me with three of them with Edmee Reit (widow of Sy), three of them with Bradley Bolke and three of them with Alison Arngrim (daughter of Norma MacMillan).I first saw the 15+ minute documentary in Oregon and was upset that I looked so ""zombie-like"", but after re-watching it a second time, it's not too bad, but I still come across as a bit dull in comparison with the animated Alison, who makes the documentary fun!The commentaries are generally pretty good, considering that I had never done anything like this before, and recorded everything in a marathon 10-hour session in my home.They DID get the ""New Casper Cartoon Show"" opening and closing in color which I begged them to do, and got MOST of the individual episode openings where Casper and friends zip in to watch a cartoon in a TV cloud.Now, for the negatives. Even though I begged them to go back to Paramount to get the original cartoons for the original elements and credits, it just wasn't or couldn't be done. As a result, the Harveytoons opening is used and even ""The Harveytoon Show"" opening is used in a couple of cases. And on the public domain cartoons, the Paramount logos are used, but in one case the UM&M; openings are used.HOWEVER, if you use that above criteria to NOT buy the set, you will be missing out, because this is the most comprehensive set of Casper cartoons that has ever been issued and probably ever will be issued. It has the ONLY appearance of ""The Bored Billionaire"" EVER on home video AND is the only set that has all of the Casper cartoons in one place; a feat that will probably not be repeated any time soon.As a result, you can literally toss out any previous Casper DVD collections, as this definitely takes the place of those sets.
