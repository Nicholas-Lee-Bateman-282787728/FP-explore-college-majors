That doesn't mean I didn't sneak home after school and watch when no one was looking...Seeing all the characters come alive in this very hokey teenage melodrama filled with bad jokes and comedy still makes me laugh. The twins do a great job of reprising the roles of Elizabeth and Jessica, but how people could get them mixed up is beyond me! In the first minute of the show, we see Elizabeth dressed very preppy and cute, while her slutty sister dresses like an MTV model. It cracks me up seeing the terrible actors approach the girls pretending to get them mixed up. Its obvious: Jessica is the wanna-be prostitue, while Elizabeth is a prude.Not that this show doesn't have other good qualitites, such as bad 90's music and bad haircuts for the boys. Elizabeth's boyfriend is a stick who is dumb as a brick, but kinda cute in the 90's preppy boy way...Seriously, this show makes me laugh, and I really enjoy the campy drama and overacting, especially on the part of Lila and Winston, who follow exactly Franscine Pascal's book characters.If you expect a better 90210, look elsewhere, but if you want 90's teenage drama, go for this series and read the books!",4,Sweet Valley High is my guilty pleasure,1121299200,"07 14, 2005",2005,1369,"['young', 'adult', 'loved', 'books', 'vaguely', 'remebered', 'watching', 'few', 'episodes', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'then', 'was', 'too', 'old', 'be', 'watching', 'series', 'embarassed', 'front', 'friends', ""n't"", 'mean', 'did', ""n't"", 'sneak', 'home', 'school', 'watch', 'when', 'one', 'was', 'looking', 'Seeing', 'characters', 'come', 'alive', 'very', 'hokey', 'teenage', 'melodrama', 'filled', 'bad', 'jokes', 'comedy', 'still', 'twins', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'reprising', 'roles', 'Elizabeth', 'Jessica', 'how', 'people', 'could', 'get', 'mixed', 'up', 'first', 'minute', 'show', 'see', 'Elizabeth', 'dressed', 'very', 'preppy', 'cute', 'slutty', 'sister', 'dresses', 'MTV', 'model', 'up', 'seeing', 'terrible', 'actors', 'approach', 'girls', 'pretending', 'get', 'mixed', 'up', 'obvious', 'Jessica', 'wanna-be', 'prostitue', 'Elizabeth', 'prude.Not', 'show', ""n't"", 'have', 'other', 'good', 'qualitites', 'such', 'bad', '90', 'music', 'bad', 'haircuts', 'boys', 'Elizabeth', 'boyfriend', 'stick', 'who', 'dumb', 'brick', 'kinda', 'cute', '90', 'preppy', 'boy', 'way', 'Seriously', 'show', 'really', 'enjoy', 'campy', 'drama', 'overacting', 'especially', 'part', 'Lila', 'Winston', 'who', 'follow', 'exactly', 'Franscine', 'Pascal', 'book', 'characters.If', 'expect', 'better', '90210', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'want', '90', 'teenage', 'drama', 'go', 'series', 'read', 'books']",Sweet Valley High: Season 1

I didn't watch much of the show when it was airing new episodes on the TV channels but I got ahold of the DVDs for season 1 and just loved it. Totally, campy escapist fun. No life lessons to be learned; no realistic charatcers; no apologizing for the high camp factor. It is such a soap opera and that's why I love it. I hope they put the other seasons on DVD.As for the acting the only truly bad actors were the guy that pays Todd (he is so bad he gives me the heebie-jeebies) and the guy that plays Bruce. I notice they didn't have too many hot guys on the show. But I digress ...I really liked the actresses that played the twins. They were a little too old to play high school teens but they did an admirable job. Which ever twin played Elizabeth (was it Cynthia or Brittany???) did the impossible and made me sympathize with Liz which I would have never thought possible because she always struck me as a self-righteous, hypocritical bore.I hated the TV series version of Todd. I don't remember him being so agressive and jealous. Every guy who even looked at Liz cross-eyed he wanted to wrestle to the ground. And Jessica sure is a ho-bag.The best episodes are the dancing one and the three-part arc about the creepy hospital orderly, Peter (who's name was Carl in the book series, I believe) who kidnapped Liz. The guy who played him ... he makes Hannibal Lecter a little less scary.

So I impulsively bought this dvd (somewhere else for around $20) & I just couldn't get into it. I watched about 3 1/2 episodes, but Jessica (one of the main stars) just grated on my nerves. This girl was such a tease. Plus everytime she did something wrong she got off pretty lightly. If anything she would get back at somebody else. She was also very easily forgiven by her sister, whom she used just like everyone else. Some shows like Saved by the Bell I can watch now & still enjoy, but not this show. I'm happy for the huge fans of this show that it's out there for them. However, if you aren't a hard core fan, like me, make it a rental, not a purchase.

870417,A254A6HH0Z4CW0,B0006J28E6,Geneva,"[4, 4]","I have been a fan of the sweet valley book series ever since I was a little girl, and grew up reading all of the books. And now, even though I'm 19, I still enjoy reading the books frequently, going back in time to the magical world of sweet valley.I also watched the show when it was on TV, but only saw a few episodes here and there, so I was ecstatic when I saw it on DVD.The show is definitely completely different than the books, having only a few of the same storylines in the episodes. But nevertheless, the show is fun to watch, from the hilariously corny storylines, to the bad fashion choices. So keep in mind, if you are looking for a more serious, realistic high school show (the oc or 90210) then this isn't the show for you.The most ridiculous part of the show is during the first episode, at the the dance part where hilariously bad actors are trying to figure which twin is which, when its clear which one is jessica, and which one is elizabeth, just from looking at the outfits they are wearing.Cynthia and brittany daniel make THE perfect Jessica and Elizabeth wakefield, despite the fact that they look way too old to be portraying 16 year old high school students.The actor who plays Winston Egbert also his role down perfectly. He both looks, and acts, just as you would imagine him in the book series.Two characters that I'm a little bit disappointed with are Todd Wilkins and Lila Fowler. Todd is completely different than the Todd you read about in the book. The amount of jealousy he has everytime another guy even looks at elizabeth is completely ridiculous, and I've lost count of how many times he has said ""I'm gonna kill that guy!"" I've gotta say, he's probably the worst actor on the show.And Lila isn't a whole lot better. First of all, she looks nothing like she is described in the book. And she acts nothing like she does in the book either. I can see why she was replaced later on in the show with a different actress (I think her name is Shirlee something?) who is a much better Lila.All in all, if your looking for a fun, goofy version of the book series, then I would recommend that you watch this show.I was disappointed to hear that the other seasons wouldn't be put on DVD, because of poor sales.

870418,AVO9QQWRRXESK,B0006J28E6,Heather Hays,"[5, 6]","I saw this in the store and picked it up on a whim. I read Sweet Valley High from years and started when I was nine years old. I wanted something light and entertaining and I had only seen the show a couple of times before.I really thought that the girls cast as the twins would be the biggest disappointment. Since I had read so many of their books, I had a pretty solid idea of what Elizabeth and Jessica should sound like. It is only a tribute to the amazing talent of Brittany and Cynthia Daniels that I wasn't, and moreover, I was impressed with their flair for delivering even the corniest lines and giving merit to the more ridiculous plotlines.The supporting cast was where I had the most problems. Bridget Flannery did not do a terrible job playing the role of Lila, but I also thought that her portrayal was not up to par with the Lila from the books. I always saw Lila as cooler, disdainful, never rattled. In the show, she came across as loud and abrasive, and overly gossipy (More like Caroline Spears). She didn't look like any sort of competition for Brittany. Jessica totally upstaged her in every single scene.For the guy cast as Todd, it was fifty fifty. Sometimes, he delivered his lines very woodenly, with no feeling whatsoever. Others, he was more charismatic, but still not spectacular. Although he is handsome, he didn't act like someone who could have gotten Elizabeth Wakefield.Bruce was a very vague echo of how I pictured him. He always hangs around with this short, skinny hispanic guy that didn't exist in the books. (I guess to make the series more diverse). Once again, he was nowhere near as interesting or complex as he was in the books.Enid and Winston for the most part, filled their roles very well. I also liked Amarylis, (I think that's her name) but she wasn't in the books either.One last absurd sidenote I'm going to add, is in this alternate TV universe, Steven doesn't exist and the Wakefield parents are faceless entities and barely mentioned.The first season borrowed from the books quite a bit, and I had fun seeing some of the novels brought to life.The episodes are:-Dangerous Love (It has some scenes from Double Love, Jessica gets thrown in the pool. It's also a good introduction of the twins.)-Oracle On The Air (As far as I can tell, this doesn't mirror a novel at all)-Skin and Bones-Critical Mess-What, me, Study? (Parts of it are taken from book three)-Almost married (Book 102)-Curse of Lawrence MansonDISC 2-Prince of Santa Dora-Coma (Book 7, Dear Sister)-Uh Oh Seven-Secrets (Book 2)-Photographic Evidence (One of the books, I don't remember which one)-Club X (Jessica against Bruce)-Poetic Injustice-Stolen DiaryDISC 3-Love on the Line-Working Girls-Dancin' Fools-Kidnapped Part 1, 2, and 3 (#13, Kidnapped. I thought they did great with this one)-Say GoodbyeThis show does have some good features, and I really enjoyed watching it. I think the main reason it flopped was because the Daniels twins couldn't carry the entire script by themselves.",4,I'd say maybe four and a half stars,1112400000,"04 2, 2005",2005,3006,"['saw', 'store', 'picked', 'up', 'whim', 'read', 'Sweet', 'Valley', 'High', 'years', 'started', 'when', 'was', 'nine', 'years', 'old', 'wanted', 'something', 'light', 'entertaining', 'had', 'only', 'seen', 'show', 'couple', 'times', 'before.I', 'really', 'thought', 'girls', 'cast', 'twins', 'would', 'be', 'biggest', 'disappointment', 'had', 'read', 'so', 'many', 'books', 'had', 'pretty', 'solid', 'idea', 'what', 'Elizabeth', 'Jessica', 'should', 'sound', 'only', 'tribute', 'amazing', 'talent', 'Brittany', 'Cynthia', 'Daniels', 'was', ""n't"", 'moreover', 'was', 'impressed', 'flair', 'delivering', 'even', 'corniest', 'lines', 'giving', 'merit', 'more', 'ridiculous', 'plotlines.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'was', 'where', 'had', 'most', 'problems', 'Bridget', 'Flannery', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'terrible', 'job', 'playing', 'role', 'Lila', 'also', 'thought', 'portrayal', 'was', 'not', 'up', 'par', 'Lila', 'books', 'always', 'saw', 'Lila', 'cooler', 'disdainful', 'never', 'rattled', 'show', 'came', 'loud', 'abrasive', 'overly', 'gossipy', 'More', 'Caroline', 'Spears', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'sort', 'competition', 'Brittany', 'Jessica', 'totally', 'upstaged', 'single', 'scene.For', 'guy', 'cast', 'Todd', 'was', 'fifty', 'fifty', 'Sometimes', 'delivered', 'lines', 'very', 'woodenly', 'feeling', 'whatsoever', 'Others', 'was', 'more', 'charismatic', 'still', 'not', 'spectacular', 'handsome', 'did', ""n't"", 'act', 'someone', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'gotten', 'Elizabeth', 'Wakefield.Bruce', 'was', 'very', 'vague', 'echo', 'how', 'pictured', 'always', 'around', 'short', 'skinny', 'hispanic', 'guy', 'did', ""n't"", 'exist', 'books', 'guess', 'make', 'series', 'more', 'diverse', 'Once', 'again', 'was', 'nowhere', 'near', 'interesting', 'complex', 'was', 'books.Enid', 'Winston', 'most', 'part', 'filled', 'roles', 'very', 'well', 'also', 'liked', 'Amarylis', 'think', 'name', 'was', ""n't"", 'books', 'either.One', 'last', 'absurd', 'sidenote', ""'m"", 'going', 'add', 'alternate', 'TV', 'universe', 'Steven', ""n't"", 'exist', 'Wakefield', 'parents', 'are', 'faceless', 'entities', 'barely', 'mentioned.The', 'first', 'season', 'borrowed', 'books', 'quite', 'bit', 'had', 'fun', 'seeing', 'novels', 'brought', 'life.The', 'episodes', 'are', '-Dangerous', 'Love', 'scenes', 'Double', 'Love', 'Jessica', 'thrown', 'pool', 'also', 'good', 'introduction', 'twins', '-Oracle', 'Air', 'As', 'far', 'can', 'tell', ""n't"", 'mirror', 'novel', '-Skin', 'Bones-Critical', 'Mess-What', 'Study', 'Parts', 'are', 'taken', 'book', 'three', '-Almost', 'married', 'Book', '102', '-Curse', 'Lawrence', 'MansonDISC', '2-Prince', 'Santa', 'Dora-Coma', 'Book', '7', 'Dear', 'Sister', '-Uh', 'Oh', 'Seven-Secrets', 'Book', '2', '-Photographic', 'Evidence', 'One', 'books', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'one', 'X', 'Jessica', 'Bruce', '-Poetic', 'Injustice-Stolen', 'DiaryDISC', '3-Love', 'Line-Working', 'Girls-Dancin', 'Fools-Kidnapped', 'Part', '1', '2', '3', '13', 'Kidnapped', 'thought', 'did', 'great', 'one', 'GoodbyeThis', 'show', 'have', 'good', 'features', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'think', 'main', 'reason', 'flopped', 'was', 'Daniels', 'twins', 'could', ""n't"", 'carry', 'entire', 'script']",Sweet Valley High: Season 1

It was so strange though to not have any parents of the kids for the duration of the show.

Now, after an excruciatingly long wait, Season 1 is finally making its way to DVD!While I wish the series would have concentrated more on serious issues, the tone of the series was light, fluffy, and fun, with just enough seriousness thrown into the mix to make it addictive. The show was a guilty pleasure if there ever was one. Great characters, clever dialogue, and wonderful production values put it above the rest.

It is now 24th June, 2011........and I am heartened by the listing of ""Sweet Valley High, Season 2,""  ""Sweet Valley High, Season 3"", ""Sweet Valley High, Season 4"", and ""Sweet Valley High, the Complete Series"", which come up as possible choices when I put ""Sweet Valley High"" in the Amazon search engine.  Thogh, sadly, whihever of these choices I now put in the search enegine, ONLY Season One comes up, I still think, hopefully, that these other choices showing up, presages these DVDs actually being released?????  SVH is literate, witty, and full of fun!  It has some of THE greatest repartee-dialogue, (and quick rejoinders!) on any TV show I've ever seen -- teen-age show or adult!  The stories are sweet -- the dialogue, decisive!  I truly believe that if William F. Buckley were still alive, he, too, would amire the literate dialogue in this show.  As mentioned below, listening to the COMPLETE series is a fine and easy assertiveness training course!I sure hope the other shows in this series will be put on DVD!  With ""dross-dialogue"" teen shows like ""Sabrina The Teenage Witch"", and ""Hannah Montana"" being given multiple, (if not complete!) DVD reproductions, it is truly a crying shame that S.V.H. --- with it's truly witty dialogue -- has, (at present), only it's first season on DVD.  Don't get me wrong -- these other teen shows DO have great stories....but who can stand to watch the complete shows, with that AWFUL, and amateurish dialogue around....  These other shows are purportedly written by professionals....but even the writing by so many ""amateur"" Amazon reviewers is so much bettr!  S.V.H. is THE best!!!!!  Hopefully, we will NOT have to wait TOO much longer for the remaining seasons to be put on DVD for all to enjoy!!!!!O R I G I N A L......R E V I E W :SWEET VALLEY HIGH is a miraculous piece of work!  I saw all that I could, when it was on network TV...and loved 99% of it!PLEASE....CAN WE HAVE THE OTHER SEASONS ON DVD AS WELL?  I'm sure I'm not the only one who would buy them immediately?  (If they can't be put on DVD...how about audio CDs or cassettes?  As you can see, I REALLY, REALLY WANT TO OWN THE E N T I R E SERIES!The hallmark of this series...what sets it apart from most other teen shows, (or any TV shows, for that matter), is the GREAT WITTY WRITING!  I kept a long list of the witty, delightfully non-politcally correct repartee of this show, and still have it.  Such phrases as ""I don't want to be politically correct -- I want to think for myself!"", ""Do you have a licence to be rude?"", ""Why do I need a 'sense of closure'?"", ""Other people can think the way they want, cause I don't care!"", ""I am SO over this 'selfless' thing!"", ""Everything here is just so small, and insignificant, and ugly!"", ""Too much is never enough!"", ""I'm worth it...I'm worth it ALL!"", ""When did you go mortal?"", ""I am NOT your way-average worker!"", ""It takes time to look this good!"", ""It's NOT  that I don't have a work ethic...it's that I despise manual labour!"" ""Do I look as good as I think I do?"", ""Make sure your dress and hair are right -- that's all anybody cares about.""  ""How is the air up there on Olympus?"", and the immortal, ""Limos, LIMOS....L I M O S !""....might not be what is taught in Sunday school...but it IS what goes on in the minds of (too?) many teens and pre-teens.  It's good to see it come out...for usage in dealing with real-life bullies, (""How is the air up there on Olympus?"", ""Do you have a licence to be rude?), and also to see how Too Much Egoism can lead to bad consequences...as Jessica Wakefield. the more opportunistic of the two twins in this series, often finds to her chagrin, (and the viewers satisfaction).  The kinder Elizabeth Wakefield, (her twin), also seeks fame and fortune...but not quite so much at the expense of others, as her twin would do.I haven't read any of the ""SVH"" books, (so far)...so I am still confused as to where the girls' parents are.  One never sees them, and they are never mentioned.  Are they alive or dead? Are they millionaires who have given their daughters their own home, and gone on with their own lives?  One is left in limbo as to this....and it does have a deleterious effect on the believability of the show.  If the parents aren't there...please tell us why, and where they are!I like the idea of the sweet, simple, happy-go-lucky guy friend of the girls...who turns out to come from a very, very wealthy family.  It's nice to know that all rich people are not totally stuck up.  (Reminds me of the time that Richard Nixon tried to marry off one of his daughters to Prince Charles...but that Prince Charles found Ms. Nixon ""too royal"" for his taste!It's not money, but character, that makes anyone the person he or she is....)Anyway, this is one great series!  I'm glad the first season is on DVD!  And since I just bought my first DVD player, I'm going to buy it!  I suggest that anyone else who is looking for some great dialogue, fine acting, teen-age capers, and wonderful phrases for assertiveness training, and who can afford the price of this priceless set, do so as well!To repeat:  PLEASE MAKE THE OTHER SEASONS OF THIS GREAT SHOW AVAILABLE AS WELL!!!!!  : )ADDENDUM:  I have just bought and viewed some of the episodes of the first season, and realize that some of the phrases used, and characters described may not be in the first season...but fromfurther seasons.  The very indelibility of these phrases and characters attests to how wonderful they are.  Hopefully, when these other seasons are released, they can be viewed, (in all their glory!), as well!",5,S W E E T....A S S E R T I V E N E S S....T R A I N I N G !,1153440000,"07 21,

870428,A1OBPHRXHZF8P6,B0006J28E6,"Robin Orlowski ""political activist""","[19, 19]","The 22 episode first season was a miracle for myself and many others who grew up reading the series.  I honestly was shocked when this series hit the air just because the idea of a TV series was long overdue.It obviously had a higher production budget than 'Saved By the Bell' but for some reason, this series never attained 90210/OC type ratings.Sweet Valley High  revolves around the adventures identical twins Elizabeth and Jessica Wakefield (played by real-life twins Cynthia and Brittany Daniels) have while growing up in southern California. To the first season's credit, several of the episodes were loosely based on the series.Not to be missed episodes include ""Dangerous love"" which (in trying to incorporate some book elements) introduces us to the TV Sweet Valley gang for the very first time. Bridget Flanery plays a perfect Lila Fowler because she is so scheming and ruthless.""Almost married"" has Elizabeth invite Todd (Ryan James Bittle) over for the weekend after his parents' house is being painted and her parents are going away. Jessica blackmails Elizabeth into then having a party, but is in trouble when she cannot return the emergency credit card purchased outfit which was worn at the forbidden party. Because Elizabeth traditionally has the 'square' reputation, the idea of her and Todd living together for the weekend was a really neat plot development.When Enid's (Amy Danles) new boyfriend becomes the spokesperson for an anti-drug campaign in ""Secrets"", she is worried. Before meeting Ronnie (Drew Bell II), she used to have a drug problem. Jessica (ever the schemer) tries to use this overheard information to snag the publicity opportunity for herself. The absurdity of Steven Tyler (even in name) doing an anti-drug campaign with such an uptight and narrow-minded teen is second to how Ronnie treats Enid. He breaks up with her, but Enid is now free to find somebody who is not judgmental.Finally, at the season finale ""Say goodbye"" Todd has an opportunity to attend an exclusive basketball camp in Vermont, but this alternately means leaving Sweet Valley-and Elizabeth. Because a long distance relationship is a very realistic scenario for many teens and the young at heart, it made a wonderful close. We knew Elizabeth and Todd would somehow stay together, but had to watch the next season of this series in order to find out.Although several episodes in this season are loosely based on the series, there are some errors. In addition to Elizabeth and Jessica, the Wakefields are also supposed to have an eldest son named Steven, but he receives no mention. Plus, Alice and Ned Wakefield are (oddly considering their very active book presence) never actually seen in the series, the most presence they have is an off-camera voice.",4,"It's not as 'sweet' as the classic books, but was still fun!",1110153600,"03 7, 2005",2005,2763,"['22', 'episode', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'miracle', 'myself', 'many', 'others', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'reading', 'series', 'honestly', 'was', 'shocked', 'when', 'series', 'hit', 'air', 'just', 'idea', 'TV', 'series', 'was', 'long', 'overdue.It', 'obviously', 'had', 'higher', 'production', 'budget', ""'Saved"", 'Bell', 'reason', 'series', 'never', 'attained', '90210/OC', 'type', 'ratings.Sweet', 'Valley', 'High', 'adventures', 'identical', 'twins', 'Elizabeth', 'Jessica', 'Wakefield', 'played', 'real-life', 'twins', 'Cynthia', 'Brittany', 'Daniels', 'have', 'growing', 'up', 'southern', 'California', 'first', 'season', 'credit', 'several', 'episodes', 'were', 'loosely', 'based', 'series.Not', 'be', 'missed', 'episodes', 'include', 'Dangerous', 'love', 'trying', 'incorporate', 'book', 'elements', 'TV', 'Sweet', 'Valley', 'gang', 'very', 'first', 'time', 'Bridget', 'Flanery', 'perfect', 'Lila', 'Fowler', 'so', 'scheming', 'ruthless', 'Almost', 'married', 'Elizabeth', 'invite', 'Todd', 'Ryan', 'James', 'Bittle', 'weekend', 'parents', 'house', 'being', 'painted', 'parents', 'are', 'going', 'away', 'Jessica', 'Elizabeth', 'then', 'having', 'party', 'trouble', 'when', 'can', 'not', 'return', 'emergency', 'credit', 'card', 'purchased', 'outfit', 'was', 'worn', 'forbidden', 'party', 'Elizabeth', 'traditionally', ""'square"", 'reputation', 'idea', 'Todd', 'living', 'together', 'weekend', 'was', 'really', 'neat', 'plot', 'development.When', 'Enid', 'Amy', 'Danles', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'spokesperson', 'anti-drug', 'campaign', 'Secrets', 'worried', 'meeting', 'Ronnie', 'Drew', 'Bell', 'II', 'used', 'have', 'drug', 'problem', 'Jessica', 'ever', 'schemer', 'use', 'overheard', 'information', 'snag', 'publicity', 'opportunity', 'herself', 'absurdity', 'Steven', 'Tyler', 'even', 'name', 'doing', 'anti-drug', 'campaign', 'uptight', 'narrow-minded', 'teen', 'second', 'how', 'Ronnie', 'Enid', 'up', 'Enid', 'now', 'free', 'find', 'somebody', 'who', 'not', 'judgmental.Finally', 'season', 'finale', 'Say', 'goodbye', 'Todd', 'opportunity', 'attend', 'exclusive', 'basketball', 'camp', 'Vermont', 'alternately', 'leaving', 'Sweet', 'Valley-and', 'Elizabeth', 'long', 'distance', 'relationship', 'very', 'realistic', 'scenario', 'many', 'teens', 'young', 'heart', 'made', 'wonderful', 'close', 'knew', 'Elizabeth', 'Todd', 'would', 'somehow', 'stay', 'together', 'had', 'watch', 'next', 'season', 'series', 'order', 'find', 'out.Although', 'several', 'episodes', 'season', 'are', 'loosely', 'based', 'series', 'are', 'errors', 'addition', 'Elizabeth', 'Jessica', 'Wakefields', 'are', 'also', 'supposed', 'have', 'eldest', 'son', 'named', 'Steven', 'mention', 'Alice', 'Ned', 'Wakefield', 'are', 'oddly', 'considering', 'very', 'active', 'book', 'presence', 'never', 'actually', 'seen', 'series', 'most', 'presence', 'have', 'off-camera', 'voice']",Sweet Valley High: Season 1

Obviously, it was filmed in a different day and age, so some of the filming was rough.  It was pretty cheesy, but I still watched them.  If the other seasons were released on DVD, I'd definitely watch them, just to see how they compare to the book series, but without high hopes or anything.  I think the only thing that kept it interesting was Winston Egbert :D",4,Interesting take on the book series...,1225065600,"10 27, 2008",2008,458,"['So', 'was', 'fan', 'book', 'series', 'who', 'decided', 'check', 'out', 'DVD', 'set', 'was', 'interesting', 'Obviously', 'was', 'filmed', 'different', 'day', 'age', 'filming', 'was', 'rough', 'was', 'pretty', 'cheesy', 'still', 'watched', 'other', 'seasons', 'were', 'released', 'DVD', ""'d"", 'definitely', 'watch', 'just', 'see', 'how', 'compare', 'book', 'series', 'high', 'hopes', 'anything', 'think', 'only', 'thing', 'kept', 'interesting', 'was', 'Winston', 'Egbert', 'D']",Sweet Valley High: Season 1

They have only released the 1st season on DVD and that was in 2005. Release the other seasons for the nostalgia of other now 20 & 30-somethings that watched this in the 1990s. Its basic - the discs are arranged neatly and it doesn't have any bonus features on it.,4,Sweet Valley High DVD,1386288000,"12 6, 2013",2013,344,"['Sweet', 'Valley', 'High', 'Damn', 'books', 'cheesy', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'TV', 'show', 'have', 'only', 'released', '1st', 'season', 'DVD', 'was', '2005', 'Release', 'other', 'seasons', 'nostalgia', 'other', 'now', '20', '30-somethings', 'watched', '1990s', 'basic', 'discs', 'are', 'arranged', 'neatly', ""n't"", 'have', 'bonus', 'features']",Sweet Valley High: Season 1
