1622430,AYW1XHCZSCAVM,B00B5W80OA,DVD Collector,"[0, 0]",Might be made for teens but trust me its hard as H*** to do and its affordable!  Comes with her band to do a ton of arm and leg exercises and 4 DVD's. Heck of a workout and its not easy.  You will love it........ the only thing is that she doesn't say to much during the video so you have to really concentrate on her moves and how many each one she does. Worth every penny. Highly recommend it. And I'm not a teen or anywhere close to it. If you have you tube check out her Dance Cardio with Nicole Richie heck of a workout if you can learn it by the video.

1622433,A2V5R832QCSOMX,B00B5W80OA,Leanne,"[19, 22]","Like the previous reviewer, I'm not a teen, but I bought this since I wanted to work my way into doing Glutecentric Metamorphosis, and thought that it would be a good transition into the longer commitment that Glutecentric requires.  This is a great introduction to Tracy Anderson's muscular structure work, and you can use it regardless of your age.The set comes with four DVDs and a band that you use for the workouts.The cardio workout has two parts:  a 20-minute segment that is just Tracy doing some freestyle dance moves, and a 10-minute segment with Tracy and one of the Tracy Anderson Method (TAM) trainers Maria doing the dance with an inner-city dance troupe.  The idea is to combine both segments so that you're doing a 30-minute workout.  If you've been frustrated with the lack of cueing in some of Tracy's other dance DVDs, you might like this one better since this one moves a lot more slowly and Tracy breaks things down more.The three muscular structure workouts are 30 minutes long each, and both use the included band.  They have about 30 reps for the legs, and are still pretty challenging.  Using the band adds some uniqueness to the moves.The background is really colorful, and Tracy smiles a lot in the workouts and seems to be having a lot of fun.If you're used to the Metamorphosis sets, which each target a person's problem areas, this set doesn't do that since Tracy has said that teens are still developing, and so need a more rounded program.  In that respect, this is almost like an Omnicentric set, in that it targets the entire body.Another difference between this set and the Metamorphosis sets is that it's also meant to be repeated by teens, whereas in Meta, you only do each workout 10 times, before moving on to the next level.  The TAM trainers have said that this is also because teens' bodies are changing, and they don't need to vary their workouts as much.If you are buying this for a teen, on the TAM forums, several people have mentioned that it's meant to be used for children ages 10 and up.Hope that helps!",5,"Great TAM workout for non-teens, too!",1363392000,"03 16, 2013",2013,2053,"['previous', 'reviewer', ""'m"", 'not', 'teen', 'bought', 'wanted', 'work', 'way', 'doing', 'Glutecentric', 'Metamorphosis', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'transition', 'longer', 'commitment', 'Glutecentric', 'great', 'introduction', 'Tracy', 'Anderson', 'muscular', 'structure', 'work', 'can', 'use', 'regardless', 'age.The', 'set', 'four', 'DVDs', 'band', 'use', 'workouts.The', 'cardio', 'workout', 'two', 'parts', '20-minute', 'segment', 'just', 'Tracy', 'doing', 'freestyle', 'dance', 'moves', '10-minute', 'segment', 'Tracy', 'one', 'Tracy', 'Anderson', 'Method', 'TAM', 'trainers', 'Maria', 'doing', 'dance', 'inner-city', 'dance', 'troupe', 'idea', 'combine', 'segments', ""'re"", 'doing', '30-minute', 'workout', ""'ve"", 'been', 'frustrated', 'lack', 'cueing', 'Tracy', 'other', 'dance', 'DVDs', 'might', 'like', 'one', 'better', 'one', 'lot', 'more', 'slowly', 'Tracy', 'things', 'down', 'more.The', 'three', 'muscular', 'structure', 'workouts', 'are', '30', 'minutes', 'long', 'use', 'included', 'band', 'have', '30', 'reps', 'legs', 'are', 'still', 'pretty', 'challenging', 'Using', 'band', 'uniqueness', 'moves.The', 'background', 'really', 'colorful', 'Tracy', 'lot', 'workouts', 'be', 'having', 'lot', 'fun.If', ""'re"", 'used', 'Metamorphosis', 'sets', 'target', 'person', 'problem', 'areas', 'set', ""n't"", 'do', 'Tracy', 'said', 'teens', 'are', 'still', 'developing', 'so', 'need', 'more', 'rounded', 'program', 'respect', 'almost', 'Omnicentric', 'set', 'entire', 'body.Another', 'difference', 'set', 'Metamorphosis', 'sets', 'also', 'meant', 'be', 'repeated', 'teens', 'whereas', 'Meta', 'only', 'do', 'workout', '10', 'times', 'moving', 'next', 'level', 'TAM', 'trainers', 'have', 'said', 'also', 'teens', 'bodies', 'are', 'changing', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'vary', 'workouts', 'much.If', 'are', 'buying', 'teen', 'TAM', 'forums', 'several', 'people', 'have', 'mentioned', 'meant', 'be', 'used', 'children', 'ages', '10', 'up.Hope']",Tracy Anderson: Teen Meta
1622434,A3GLIIWR5140OF,B00B5W80OA,Myscrtwrld,"[3, 3]","I love Tracy Anderson's workouts and I love what they are doing for me.  Teen META is easier than the Customized adult Metamorphosis programs.  I bought this to add to my adult Metamorphosis on the days I wanted more toning work.  The layout is more colorful, but she didn't even speak throughout the first toning section. At least there is voice over in the adult version. I am used to the way she operates and it didn't faze me although it might be harder for a beginner.The dance section wasn't nearly as fun as Metamorphosis so I can't see myself using that disc again.  If you can't afford Metamorphosis this is a great option, but I prefer the adult version much more overall.  As a supplement workout this does the trick and adds some new variety moves with the band.",4,Great workout - not as good as metamorphosis,1370822400,"06 10, 2013",2013,774,"['love', 'Tracy', 'Anderson', 'workouts', 'love', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'Teen', 'META', 'easier', 'Customized', 'adult', 'Metamorphosis', 'programs', 'bought', 'add', 'adult', 'Metamorphosis', 'days', 'wanted', 'more', 'toning', 'work', 'layout', 'more', 'colorful', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'speak', 'first', 'toning', 'section', 'least', 'voice', 'adult', 'version', 'am', 'used', 'way', 'did', ""n't"", 'faze', 'might', 'be', 'harder', 'beginner.The', 'dance', 'section', 'was', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'fun', 'Metamorphosis', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'using', 'disc', 'again', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'Metamorphosis', 'great', 'option', 'prefer', 'adult', 'version', 'much', 'more', 'overall', 'supplement', 'trick', 'new', 'variety', 'moves', 'band']",Tracy Anderson: Teen Meta
1622435,A3MX44NOGGPVS4,B00B5W80OA,Nadine Cummington,"[9, 10]","I was thinking about getting the Tracy Anderson method but thought it was too much money for a few discs. So when I saw the Teen Meta, I thought it would be perfect. Cheap price and it works all over the body. I had to stop so many times with this since there are so many repetitions. After doing this a few times, I am already seeing definition in my legs and I am noticing a difference in how my jeans fit.This is a great way to get fit and tone without bulking up. Now, I must say that her Dance Cardio that is included in this is much simpler than the ones for her Metamorphosis for adults. I could not follow along with those if I tried (saw them on youtube). I am not a teen and this is the perfect workout for me, and there is no workout schedule, which I find to be good since I can rotate this in with my other workout dvds.She does not talk at all the workouts, but if you look at the screen every now and then you will pick up on what she is doing quickly, and be able to keep up when she changes positions for a new exercise.I would highly recommend this for those who do not want to spend lots of money on her other workout dvd Metamorphosis, and for those who want to tone up with high repetitions to avoid bulking up.5 stars.",5,Teen Meta Tracy Anderson,1369008000,"05 20, 2013",2013,1240,"['was', 'thinking', 'getting', 'Tracy', 'Anderson', 'method', 'thought', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'money', 'few', 'discs', 'when', 'saw', 'Teen', 'Meta', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'perfect', 'Cheap', 'price', 'body', 'had', 'stop', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'repetitions', 'doing', 'few', 'times', 'am', 'already', 'seeing', 'definition', 'legs', 'am', 'noticing', 'difference', 'how', 'jeans', 'fit.This', 'great', 'way', 'get', 'fit', 'tone', 'bulking', 'up', 'Now', 'must', 'say', 'Dance', 'Cardio', 'included', 'much', 'simpler', 'ones', 'Metamorphosis', 'adults', 'could', 'not', 'follow', 'tried', 'saw', 'youtube', 'am', 'not', 'teen', 'perfect', 'workout', 'workout', 'schedule', 'find', 'be', 'good', 'can', 'rotate', 'other', 'workout', 'dvds.She', 'not', 'talk', 'workouts', 'look', 'screen', 'now', 'then', 'will', 'pick', 'up', 'what', 'doing', 'quickly', 'be', 'able', 'keep', 'up', 'when', 'positions', 'new', 'exercise.I', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'spend', 'lots', 'money', 'other', 'workout', 'dvd', 'Metamorphosis', 'who', 'want', 'tone', 'up', 'high', 'repetitions', 'avoid', 'bulking', 'up.5', 'stars']",Tracy Anderson: Teen Meta

I really like the backdrop of teen meta.  It's so much more colorful than Metamorphosis.  If you think this video is just for teens your wrong.  This workout really worked my arms, legs, abs and even the cardio was pretty tough.  The cardio is not as tough as Meta cardio but its a lot more fun.  There is a change in music from the original Meta.  It's more upbeat.  I loved working out with the bands.  I actually liked the Teen Meta better than the original Metamorphosis.  It is definitely worth the buy even if your not a teen.  The first cardio component is twenty minutes and has Tracy jumping around for twenty minutes.  It's better than Meta because she step touches at times and the music makes it all more bearable.  The second cardio component I have not completed because I am still learning the dance moves. She has the teens with her learning the dance steps.

1622437,AZ53PPTH058F7,B00B5W80OA,Small Ewe,"[19, 25]","I am an older, 15-pounds overweight lady (just ask my doctor!) who happens to like Tracy Anderson. So, I'm not exactly the fittest person in the world, but I do like her other mat workouts.  With Teen Meta, I'm only on Level 1, and I have to say, if I was a teen and was forced to do this workout I would rather do my homework-it is HARD!!  I'm not quite sure how I can get through her Mat Workout DVD and not through these butt exercises. Anyway, not easy, people!If you're a fan, you'll recognize a lot of her moves. I long ago gave up on her cardio DVDs b/c I'm a spazz and totally uncoordinated, but I did browse through the Cardio 2 with the dance troupe, and I have hope that I'll be able to learn along with everyone else. Cardio 1--still too difficult for an old, confused bat like myself. Other thoughts:1) I giant star off for no cueing. I am talking ZERO. At least she gives occasional cues or  voice-overs on her other DVDs, but I think some cues or voice-over would have really, really, really helped here. You are facing the floor a lot and you have no idea what is going on b/c it's just music. Also, with just music, it makes the exercises that much more painful b/c of the repetition. Again, I think a teen would give up pretty quickly.Another star off because you have no idea what the heck is going on. Is your body in the right position? Who knows? I don't understand why Tracy is so averse to giving clear cueing and directions in her videos.2) Not good for weak wrists. I have to take breaks.3) That stretchy band seems sort of unsafe for a klutz. I don't know how she keeps it on straight, and I've had too many close calls with it snapping hard against my *ss.4) Tracy is very smiley and seems like she's having a good time (she also looks more like Gwynnie than ever before), so it's definitely more upbeat which is a great change of pace. However, I think her set will look outdated in a few years.I think I'll be mixing in these mat workouts with my other stuff. As for the cardio, I'm sticking to running and walking unless Cardio 2 makes me feel better about dancing.",3,This is for TEENS?!!,1365724800,"04 12, 2013",2013,2096,"['am', 'older', '15-pounds', 'overweight', 'lady', 'just', 'ask', 'doctor', 'who', 'like', 'Tracy', 'Anderson', 'So', ""'m"", 'not', 'exactly', 'fittest', 'person', 'world', 'do', 'other', 'mat', 'workouts', 'Teen', 'Meta', ""'m"", 'only', 'Level', '1', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'teen', 'was', 'forced', 'do', 'workout', 'would', 'rather', 'do', 'homework-it', 'HARD', ""'m"", 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'how', 'can', 'get', 'Mat', 'Workout', 'DVD', 'not', 'butt', 'exercises', 'Anyway', 'not', 'easy', 'people', ""'re"", 'fan', ""'ll"", 'recognize', 'lot', 'moves', 'long', 'ago', 'gave', 'up', 'cardio', 'DVDs', 'b/c', ""'m"", 'spazz', 'totally', 'uncoordinated', 'did', 'browse', 'Cardio', '2', 'dance', 'troupe', 'have', 'hope', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'learn', 'everyone', 'else', 'Cardio', '1', 'still', 'too', 'difficult', 'old', 'confused', 'bat', 'Other', 'thoughts:1', 'giant', 'star', 'off', 'cueing', 'am', 'talking', 'ZERO', 'least', 'occasional', 'cues', 'voice-overs', 'other', 'DVDs', 'think', 'cues', 'voice-over', 'would', 'have', 'really', 'really', 'really', 'helped', 'here', 'are', 'facing', 'floor', 'lot', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'going', 'just', 'music', 'Also', 'just', 'music', 'exercises', 'much', 'more', 'painful', 'b/c', 'repetition', 'Again', 'think', 'teen', 'would', 'give', 'up', 'pretty', 'quickly.Another', 'star', 'off', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'heck', 'going', 'body', 'right', 'position', 'Who', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'Tracy', 'so', 'averse', 'giving', 'clear', 'cueing', 'directions', 'videos.2', 'Not', 'good', 'weak', 'wrists', 'have', 'take', 'breaks.3', 'stretchy', 'band', 'sort', 'unsafe', 'klutz', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'straight', ""'ve"", 'had', 'too', 'many', 'close', 'snapping', 'hard', '*ss.4', 'Tracy', 'very', 'smiley', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'also', 'more', 'Gwynnie', 'ever', 'definitely', 'more', 'upbeat', 'great', 'change', 'pace', 'However', 'think', 'set', 'will', 'look', 'outdated', 'few', 'years.I', 'think', ""'ll"", 'be', 'mixing', 'mat', 'workouts', 'other', 'stuff', 'cardio', ""'m"", 'sticking', 'running', 'walking', 'Cardio', '2', 'feel', 'better', 'dancing']",Tracy Anderson: Teen Meta
