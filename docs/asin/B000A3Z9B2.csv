I doubt seriously it is legal to sell it in the USA.

Just like in the photos this DVD captures not the exact concert my grandparents seen but close enough. They seen her in the late 1980s, this was filmed in the mid 1980s, they both seen her with Kenny, just like on the DVD and the stage is in a circle form too. So when I came across this concert I really wanted to see what they were talking all about years ago, but first I did research on this DVD to see if it was what I was hoping to see and it was!. So I bought it from here, not only for me, but for my Grandparents. I knew that this would bring back great memories they shared together. When I finally recieved it in the mail we watched it all together and we absolutely loved it. The picture is really good, it's in fullscreen, the sound is really good too, everything is in English (I say that because this is a offical Korean release), they do have Korean subtitles but you can take them off, also it's in NTSC region 0. The only let down on this DVD is that it's only about 45-55 minutes long & since you'll be having so much fun singing & dancing along with it, before you know, it's all over with. It leaves you wanting more!!, but my grandparents & me still love it!",5,Leaves You Wanting More Because It's So Great!!,1170460800,"02 3, 2007",2007,1489,"['grow', 'up', 'listening', 'Dolly', 'Parton', ""'ve"", 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'hers', 'was', 'little', 'kid', 'remember', 'grandparents', 'seeing', 'Kenny', 'Rogers', 'concert', 'gave', 'photos', 'stepfather', 'toke', 'camera', 'were', 'excellent', 'photos', 'close', 'ups', 'walking', 'around', 'circle', 'shaped', 'stage', 'Just', 'photos', 'DVD', 'not', 'exact', 'concert', 'grandparents', 'seen', 'close', 'enough', 'seen', 'late', '1980s', 'was', 'filmed', 'mid', '1980s', 'seen', 'Kenny', 'just', 'DVD', 'stage', 'circle', 'form', 'too', 'when', 'came', 'concert', 'really', 'wanted', 'see', 'what', 'were', 'talking', 'years', 'ago', 'first', 'did', 'research', 'DVD', 'see', 'was', 'what', 'was', 'hoping', 'see', 'was', 'bought', 'here', 'not', 'only', 'Grandparents', 'knew', 'would', 'bring', 'back', 'great', 'memories', 'shared', 'together', 'When', 'finally', 'recieved', 'mail', 'watched', 'together', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'picture', 'really', 'good', 'fullscreen', 'sound', 'really', 'good', 'too', 'everything', 'English', 'say', 'offical', 'Korean', 'release', 'do', 'have', 'Korean', 'subtitles', 'can', 'take', 'off', 'also', 'NTSC', 'region', '0', 'only', 'let', 'down', 'DVD', 'only', '45-55', 'minutes', 'long', ""'ll"", 'be', 'having', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'singing', 'dancing', 'along', 'know', 'wanting', 'more', 'grandparents', 'still', 'love']",N/A
921040,A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F,B000A3Z9B2,"Terrance Richard ""Terry Richard""","[4, 4]","After Dolly and Kenny Rogers recorded their mega-hit ""Islands in the Stream"" in 1983 it was decided they would star in a Christmas special that aired on CBS in December, 1984 called ""A Christmas To Remember"". The album the special came from sold in the millions and the special itself was a huge ratings bonanza so the two decided to go on a world tour during much of the mid eighties to early nineties.This DVD called ""Real Love"" shows the wonderful chemistry both performers have with one another. Although an import from Asia, the disc plays on all DVD's and the clarity is excellent. We see both Dolly and Kenny performing their own solo hits, and at the end the two are joined together on stage for some amazing duet work including ""Anyone Who Isn't Me Tonight"", ""We've Got Tonight"", and ""Islands in the Stream"".There is also some behind-the-scenes clips of the two working in the studio.This special originally aired on HBO in February, 1985 which coincided with Dolly's release of her RCA album, ""Real Love"" that also served as the title for their follow-up duet of the same name.",5,"""A Class Act""",1313193600,"08 13, 2011",2011,1087,"['Dolly', 'Kenny', 'Rogers', 'recorded', 'mega-hit', 'Islands', 'Stream', '1983', 'was', 'decided', 'would', 'star', 'Christmas', 'special', 'aired', 'CBS', 'December', '1984', 'called', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Remember', 'album', 'special', 'came', 'sold', 'millions', 'special', 'was', 'huge', 'ratings', 'bonanza', 'so', 'two', 'decided', 'go', 'world', 'tour', 'much', 'mid', 'eighties', 'early', 'nineties.This', 'DVD', 'called', 'Real', 'Love', 'wonderful', 'chemistry', 'performers', 'have', 'one', 'import', 'Asia', 'disc', 'DVD', 'clarity', 'excellent', 'see', 'Dolly', 'Kenny', 'performing', 'own', 'solo', 'hits', 'end', 'two', 'are', 'joined', 'together', 'stage', 'amazing', 'duet', 'work', 'including', 'Anyone', 'Who', ""n't"", 'Me', 'Tonight', ""'ve"", 'Got', 'Tonight', 'Islands', 'Stream', 'also', 'behind-the-scenes', 'clips', 'two', 'working', 'studio.This', 'special', 'originally', 'aired', 'HBO', 'February', '1985', 'coincided', 'Dolly', 'release', 'RCA', 'album', 'Real', 'Love', 'also', 'served', 'title', 'follow-up', 'duet', 'same', 'name']",N/A
