19001,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,0767827775,Acute Observer,"[1, 3]","Nicholas and Alexandra, 1972 filmThe story begins in the private rooms of the royal couple. Nicholas has a son Alexis (named after a gentle Tsar). They talk about the war. Port Arthur is the only ice-free port on the Pacific. People are taxed to support the royal government and aristocracy. Can people get the vote? No! That would mean a loss power, as with the English and Habsburgs. Elsewhere the Socialists are voting on a policy change. ""An 18th century country in a 20th century world."" There is talk of Gregory Rasputin, a monk with healing powers. His talk charms Matyushka. Young Alexis has hemophilia, an inherited disease. There is no cure. His mother doesn't accept this. We see the other side of society. Can they fight back? Port Arthur has fallen, but the Tsar wants more soldiers. Can they fight back? Soldiers on the way to the front are greeted by the royal couple and given holy pictures.Alexis is bleeding again. [A symbol of the dynasty?] ""It's in God's hands."" His mother feels guilty about his condition. Rasputin claims special powers. Can he cure the sick? People assemble to protest against their oppression (high taxes and low wages). The bells peal. ""Go back!"" says the officer, then the soldiers fire on the crowd. A bloody picture of the Tsar symbolizes the future. ""Why wasn't I told?"" No schools or Duma for the people. [""A rifle diet""?] The loss of the war means no changes. Bolsheviks plot to gain power by any means possible. ""Rasputin is a peasant."" The Okhrana can't find all the printing presses. The people know about Rasputin's personal life. Tsar Nicholas sends Rasputin away. ""He drinks, takes bribes, and sleeps with women."" [Training for a politician?] It is a scandal. Alexandra feels guilty. The Bolsheviks get a secret message about police spies in their organization. One man alone got away from the Okhrana to bring this news. [Know why?]The Romanoff Dynasty has lasted 300 years. There are celebrations. Stolypin is assassinated in a theater before the eyes of the Tsar. [The music covers the shot.] There is more oppression against the people and the Duma. They want a system like the British; Parliamentarians are not revolutionaries. Alexis grows up. The princesses talk about their future. [Their fate comes from their parents.] Alexis suffers from his disease. The Tsar learns about a crisis, he gives the people their Duma. Alexandra wants Rasputin back to comfort Alexis. There is a dream about Archduke Ferdinand. Will anything come from it? There is a partial mobilization. Can they fight a modern war? A general mobilization will be matched, there will be a general war. [No communication with allies?] Germany declares war on Russia! ""God save the Tsar!"" One man predicts a disaster. The troops march off to war. Wounded soldiers resent their rulers. There are shortages of arms.Faith in the Tsar keeps the country together; he goes to the front. There is resentment against Rasputin and the Tsarina. Rasputin has undue influence. [Is he going mad?] Does the Tsar fail to appoint good men to the government? ""Do you believe that?"" ""It's in God's hands."" Rasputin relaxes among friends. [A mistake in judgment?] There is a shot, they must get rid of the body. The needed decrees are not signed by the Tsarina. Rasputin predicted the end of the nobility. The people are starving, fuel is scarce, the army without arms! There is a General Strike in St. Petersburg, the soldiers refuse to shoot the people. Gonshots measure the temperature of the people. There is rioting in Moscow, the Duma appointed a Provisional Government and arrested the Tsar's ministers; they also want an abdication. The generals want an abdication too! The Tsar abdicates for himself and his son on the Ides of March, 1917. ""If only you had acted sooner.""Nicholas returns to his empty palace. ""I'm sorry, I'm so ashamed."" Lenin makes a deal with the Germans to get to Sweden and then to St. Petersburg. Kerensky meets the Tsar and tells of his policies. ""England won't accept you."" Nor the Allies. There is a conflict among the new government parties. Lenin returns to St. Petersburg amid cheers. ""Revolution Now!"" The Bolsheviks have popular support. American and England want Russia in the war, so does Kerensky. The Romanoffs go into exile. The Bolsheviks take over the important centers of society, they offer peace. The cruiser `Aurora' points its guns, the government falls (they have no reliable troops). The Tsar leans of the Civil War. The Romanoffs are photographed. Alexis hurts himself. ""How many soldiers and peasants died?"" asks a sailor.Their train is stopped, the Ural Soviet takes them prisoners. The crowd is not happy. Their home's windows are painted over, they can't see out. They leave the matter in the hands of the local government. ""Good Day!"" The royal family is taken outside for sunlight. One servant tries to protect Alexis and suffers for it. Preparations are made to dispose of the bodies. The sounds of artillery announce the near presence of the enemy. ""It's all of them"" is the message. Early one morning they are told its time to leave. ""Wait in here, please."" The clock on the wall ticks away the time. Men enter and shoot their pistols. It is over.The credits name the players. This dramatic and entertaining story is based on history. It is worth watching at least once. The problem with a hereditary monarchy is the eventual decay due to absolute power and the inbreeding of royal marriages. Just human aging leads to senility, poor judgment, and other health problems. Note how this movie has no real heroes or villains, they are like actors in a play.

19005,AWEG4MT8FCU3,0767827775,Ann Bronwen,"[7, 7]","Nicholas and Alexandra is a fine movie about the last years of Tsarist rule in Russia.  It begins in a palace near St. Petersburg, in August, 1904, with the much anticipated birth of  Alexis, Tsar Nicholas's only son, and ends almost 14 years later, in a dismal room in a house in Ekaterinberg, where the Tsar, along with his wife and children were executed by gunfire.  Nicholas is seen as a kind and gentle man, devoted to his family.  But he was also Tsar of all the Russias, and as such, presided as absolute ruler over a corrupt and decayed government which  treated its citizens so badly that revolution was inevitable.  If Nicholas was aware of real condition of his country, he took no action about it.  His primary goal was to maintain his absolute power, and in this he was encouraged and assisted by his wife, the Empress Alexandra.Michael Jayston and Janet Suzman are wonderful in the title roles, not only because of their fine acting, but also their startling resemblence to the real Tsar and Tsarina.  Tom Baker plays Rasputin with aplomb and style.To appreciate this movie, however, it is important to know something about the events of that time.  The Russian Japanese war, ""Bloody Sunday"", World War I, the rise of the Bolsheviks, the Karensky government and its fateful decision to continue fighting the war against Germany; all these are defining events and crucial to the story.  And this is the director's dilema: to an expert on the period, these events are shown in minature, with insufficient depth and understanding.  Yet the movie is over three hours long, and can not afford the go into too much detail.  To a viewer who is unfamiliar with this period, these asides may be confusing or boring.  Overall the movie strikes a good balance, and is so interesting that you want to rush out and read the book on which is was based,  (""Nicholas and Alexandra"" by Robert K. Massie.)This film was underated when it was first released 36 years ago, but for anyone interested in history, and how the events of the past still resonate today, it is highly recommended.",5,The Last Romanovs,1194739200,"11 11, 2007",2007,2083,"['Nicholas', 'Alexandra', 'fine', 'movie', 'last', 'years', 'Tsarist', 'rule', 'Russia', 'palace', 'St.', 'Petersburg', 'August', '1904', 'much', 'anticipated', 'birth', 'Alexis', 'Tsar', 'Nicholas', 'only', 'son', 'almost', '14', 'years', 'later', 'dismal', 'room', 'house', 'Ekaterinberg', 'where', 'Tsar', 'wife', 'children', 'were', 'executed', 'gunfire', 'seen', 'kind', 'gentle', 'man', 'devoted', 'family', 'was', 'also', 'Tsar', 'Russias', 'such', 'presided', 'absolute', 'ruler', 'corrupt', 'decayed', 'government', 'treated', 'citizens', 'so', 'badly', 'revolution', 'was', 'inevitable', 'Nicholas', 'was', 'aware', 'real', 'condition', 'country', 'took', 'action', 'primary', 'goal', 'was', 'maintain', 'absolute', 'power', 'was', 'encouraged', 'assisted', 'wife', 'Empress', 'Alexandra.Michael', 'Jayston', 'Janet', 'Suzman', 'are', 'wonderful', 'title', 'roles', 'not', 'only', 'fine', 'acting', 'also', 'startling', 'resemblence', 'real', 'Tsar', 'Tsarina', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'Rasputin', 'aplomb', 'style.To', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'however', 'important', 'know', 'something', 'events', 'time', 'Russian', 'Japanese', 'war', 'Bloody', 'Sunday', 'World', 'War', 'rise', 'Bolsheviks', 'Karensky', 'government', 'fateful', 'decision', 'continue', 'fighting', 'war', 'Germany', 'are', 'defining', 'events', 'crucial', 'story', 'director', 'dilema', 'expert', 'period', 'events', 'are', 'shown', 'minature', 'insufficient', 'depth', 'understanding', 'movie', 'three', 'hours', 'long', 'can', 'not', 'afford', 'go', 'too', 'much', 'detail', 'viewer', 'who', 'unfamiliar', 'period', 'asides', 'may', 'be', 'confusing', 'boring', 'movie', 'good', 'balance', 'so', 'interesting', 'want', 'rush', 'out', 'read', 'book', 'was', 'based', 'Nicholas', 'Alexandra', 'Robert', 'K', 'Massie', 'film', 'was', 'underated', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', '36', 'years', 'ago', 'anyone', 'interested', 'history', 'how', 'events', 'past', 'still', 'resonate', 'today', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A
19006,A82MLYSUUU3CF,0767827775,"Bil Antoniou ""Movie madness!""","[8, 41]","If the real Romanovs were this boring it's no wonder they were all shot.  Michael Jayston and Janet Suzman play the famed Czar and Czarina of Russia, the last two monarchs to rule the Imperial nation before the Revolution broke out and changed the history of the world forever.  The listless production starts from the birth of the couple's son Alexei (who came after four daughters) through to the political upheavals brought on by Nicholas's tyranny and general ignorance of his populace's living conditions.  The last third deals with the outbreak of revolution when the entire Romanov family became prisoners of the Bolsheviks, with the odd scene of Lenin, Stalin or Trotsky shouting to the masses (or each other) helping to place the film in historical context.  Mostly, though, the film concerns itself with the goings-on inside the palace of St. Petersburg, where the loving couple talk endlessly to each other about what worries them most (their son's hemophilia among other things).  The cast is uniformly good, and screenwriter James Goldman does his best to give some grit to the story with his very well-written dialogue, but it's very little more than a boneheaded epic effort by Sam Spiegel to prove he still has what it takes to make another Lawrence Of Arabia (and obviously, he doesn't).  Even the film's ridiculously generous running time of three hours seems to be intended more as a mark of its ""prestige"" as opposed to its need to tell a story in so large a span of time (and indeed there isn't nearly enough story to fill the entire film).

Focusing mainly on the Last Russian Tsar Nicholas, his wife Alexandra, their children (including Anastasia), and also featuring the mystical/mysterious Rasputin in the mix.This film is exceedingly well-made, and quite authentic in story, presentation and characterizations.  It seems to capture the tenuousness/ uncertainty of early 20th Century Russia - and the somewhat futile attempts of the Last Tsar to keep ahead of the rapidly changing times.  But the film also has quite a few poignant moments, when this 'noble' family seems quite 'ordinary' expressing the common familial concerns of just staying together & safe and alive ('best laid plans').And the film also does a good job of highlighting the building 'unrest' percolating among the beleaguered masses.  Overall, quite an even-handed presentation ie. highlighting multiple mistakes and missteps by the Tsar and others in power, leading to Bolshevik victory (eternal question: could it have turned-out any differently?) ==> although you can't help but also sympathize with Nicholas & Alexandra's family - particularly as they await their ultimate fate (I think everyone knows the sad end to this story).The acting performance standouts are Janet Suzman as (seemingly cool & collected) Alexandra, and Tom Baker as mystical & manipulative Rasputin (Laurence Olivier even makes a few brief but pivotal appearances).Overall, another achievement in the annals of Great Historical Epics = it might even provide insights into some lingering modern-Day events/troubles.",5,Exceedingly Well-made Historical Epic ==> during fateful Reign of the Last Tsar,1399939200,"05 13, 2014",2014,1656,"['very', 'interesting', 'film', 'excellent', 'characterizations', 'extremely', 'tumultuous/', 'momentous/', 'fateful', 'historical', 'time', 'period', 'Focusing', 'mainly', 'Last', 'Russian', 'Tsar', 'Nicholas', 'wife', 'Alexandra', 'children', 'including', 'Anastasia', 'also', 'featuring', 'mystical/mysterious', 'Rasputin', 'mix.This', 'film', 'exceedingly', 'well-made', 'quite', 'authentic', 'story', 'presentation', 'characterizations', 'capture', 'tenuousness/', 'uncertainty', 'early', '20th', 'Century', 'Russia', 'somewhat', 'futile', 'attempts', 'Last', 'Tsar', 'keep', 'ahead', 'rapidly', 'changing', 'times', 'film', 'also', 'quite', 'few', 'poignant', 'moments', 'when', ""'noble"", 'family', 'quite', ""'ordinary"", 'expressing', 'common', 'familial', 'concerns', 'just', 'staying', 'together', 'safe', 'alive', ""'best"", 'laid', 'plans', '.And', 'film', 'also', 'good', 'job', 'highlighting', 'building', ""'unrest"", 'percolating', 'beleaguered', 'masses', 'Overall', 'quite', 'even-handed', 'presentation', 'ie', 'highlighting', 'multiple', 'mistakes', 'missteps', 'Tsar', 'others', 'power', 'leading', 'Bolshevik', 'victory', 'eternal', 'question', 'could', 'have', 'turned-out', 'differently', '==', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'also', 'sympathize', 'Nicholas', 'Alexandra', 'family', 'particularly', 'await', 'ultimate', 'fate', 'think', 'everyone', 'sad', 'end', 'story', 'acting', 'performance', 'standouts', 'are', 'Janet', 'Suzman', 'seemingly', 'cool', 'collected', 'Alexandra', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'mystical', 'manipulative', 'Rasputin', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'even', 'few', 'brief', 'pivotal', 'appearances', '.Overall', 'achievement', 'annals', 'Great', 'Historical', 'Epics', '=', 'might', 'even', 'provide', 'insights', 'lingering', 'modern-Day', 'events/troubles']",N/A

Although it milks sympathy at every possible opportunity, it's not hard to find pity and anger in this shocking chapter of history.I need not waste time by summarising the plot (earlier reviewers have already done so); though the film follows the Imperial family from the birth of fifth child Alexei, through the disastrous war years which toppled their rulership, finally ending on the night in 1918 when they were executed by the Bolsheviks.In a bold move, producers cast stage actress Janet Suzman (in her movie debut) as Alexandra and Michael Jayston as Nicholas; and surrounded them with a galaxy of esteemed talents in the supporting roles (chiefly among them Irene Worth as the Dowager Empress, Michael Redgrave as Sazonov, Laurence Olivier as Count Witte, and Tom Baker as a chilling Rasputin).  Lynne Frederick, Candace Glendenning, Fiona Fullerton and Ania Marson do what they can with the relatively minor roles of the royal daughters; and Roderic Noble adds untold depths in a very solid performance as Alexei.Fans and followers of Anastasia will be a little disappointed that her role in the story is no bigger than the rest of the daughters; though Fiona Fullerton is charming in the part (she'd be reunited the following year with Michael Jayston in ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" with Jayston playing author Lewis Carroll to her Alice in the opening and closing scenes of the movie).The film garnered well-deserved Academy Awards for 'Best Art Direction' (John Box, Ernest Archer, Gil Parrondo, Vernon Dixon); and 'Best Costume Design' (Yvonne Blake, Antonio Castillo).  It should be noted that designer John Box was already quite familiar with the subject at hand, having already earned the 1965 'Best Colour Art Direction' award for his work in ""Doctor Zhivago"", another story cemented in the Russian Revolution.Further Viewing: I'd definitely recommend the 1986 miniseries ""Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna"" as a followup to viewing this movie.  Based on the fascinating book by Peter Kurth (and also scripted by James Goldman), this story follows Anna Anderson, by far the most notorious claimant of the Romanov family fortune.

Massie's knowledgable biography, though he was denied access to key information until much later (and another book on the end of the Romanov Dynasty), served as the foundation for this superb film, carefully treated in every detail, with excellent performances, exquisite costumes and set design--which won Oscars--and a first-rate script.  Though the matter of a director was initially an issue due to personality clashes with the producer, the ultimate choice, Franklin J. Schaffner, who had just won an Oscar for Patton, was a fortunate one.  The film was not a box office success, however, perhaps because of the sadness, the desperation and sense of loss.  There are those in this world blessed by the stars in the heavens, despite all obstacles they can do no wrong.  And then there's the opposite.  Given a selection, Nicholas II invariably made the wrong choice, and his unfortunate destiny changed the way the world turns, for all time.  The character of his mother appears throughout, like a leitmotiv, to guide him, and he resolutely ignores her, drawing ever closer to the precipice of disaster.  This is a love story, on many levels, the love of a man for his wife, the love of both for their ailing son, the yearning, the longing, for another ending to each tragic incident, yet it remains an impassioned story that sweeps the viewer along, into majesty, into tragedy, into history.",5,The Saddest Story Ever Told,1399507200,"05 8, 2014",2014,1509,"['Great', 'films', 'often', 'come', 'fine', 'books', 'transliteration', 'completely', 'different', 'medium', 'Massie', 'knowledgable', 'biography', 'was', 'denied', 'access', 'key', 'information', 'much', 'later', 'book', 'end', 'Romanov', 'Dynasty', 'served', 'foundation', 'superb', 'film', 'carefully', 'treated', 'detail', 'excellent', 'performances', 'exquisite', 'costumes', 'set', 'design', 'won', 'Oscars', 'first-rate', 'script', 'matter', 'director', 'was', 'initially', 'issue', 'due', 'personality', 'clashes', 'producer', 'ultimate', 'choice', 'Franklin', 'J.', 'Schaffner', 'who', 'had', 'just', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Patton', 'was', 'fortunate', 'one', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'box', 'office', 'success', 'however', 'perhaps', 'sadness', 'desperation', 'sense', 'loss', 'are', 'world', 'blessed', 'stars', 'heavens', 'obstacles', 'can', 'do', 'wrong', 'then', 'opposite', 'Given', 'selection', 'Nicholas', 'II', 'invariably', 'made', 'wrong', 'choice', 'unfortunate', 'destiny', 'changed', 'way', 'world', 'time', 'character', 'mother', 'leitmotiv', 'guide', 'resolutely', 'drawing', 'ever', 'closer', 'precipice', 'disaster', 'love', 'story', 'many', 'levels', 'love', 'man', 'wife', 'love', 'ailing', 'son', 'yearning', 'longing', 'ending', 'tragic', 'incident', 'impassioned', 'story', 'viewer', 'majesty', 'tragedy', 'history']",N/A

19014,A3N94LNED0IF0R,0767827775,Charles S. Tashiro,"[203, 207]","One of the most beautifully crafted and moody epics to come out of Hollywood (or, to be accurate, Britain), &quot;Nicholas and Alexandra&quot; has never acquired the reputation it deserves. Released at a time when big budget spectaculars were considered pass&eacute;, hostile contemporary reviews have shaped the film's reputation. While hardly perfect, the film nonetheless provides a reasonably accurate, if politically conservative overview of pre-revolutionary Russia and does an excellent job of individualizing the two monarchs.The two central, completely convincing performances are by relative unknowns Michael Jayston and Janet Suzman. Several first-rate actors (Laurence Olivier, Eric Porter, Ian Holm, Alan Webb, Harry Andrews, Irene Worth, Jack Hawkins, Michael Redgrave, John McEnery, Curt Jurgens and others) support them in small parts and manage to make us forget their familiar presences to concentrate on their characters. The actors are cushioned by Yvonne Blake and Antonio Castillo's lush costumes and Richard Rodney Bennett's symphonic score in an elegant jewelry box crafted by designer John Box, cinematographer Freddie Young and director Franklin Schaffner.The film has two major failings. First, it is just a touch *too* sympathetic to the monarchs. Quite apart from the lack of any evaluation of their short-comings as leaders, there are too many scenes calculated, presumably (and questionably), to demonstrate Nicholas &quot;learning&quot; from his mistakes. Second, in the effort to dramatize a complex historical moment, there is simply too much of it. We jump from the Russo-Japanese War to the 1905 Russian Revolution to Stolypin's reforms, to Rasputin's influence, to the First World War, the Februrary Revolution, the October Revolution, and on and on. In this rush to include everything, little other than the monarchs' lives is dealt with in any depth and the efforts to depict the revolutionaries are particularly awkward.One of the most notorious scenes in the film, commented upon by more than one contemporary review, is a brief early moment when Lenin says to a journalist, &quot;Pay attention, you're about to see the birth of the Bolshevik party.&quot; That's about the level of the political evaluation, and one can understand why the scene, along with about ten minutes elsewhere, was cut in subsequent theatrical and video release. (On the other hand, the characterization of Lenin as an intolerant prig, however uncomprehending of his political ideas, does ring remarkably true.) The DVD restores these excisions. The transfer is considerably warmer than Columbia's previous video releases, and is 16:9 enhanced.I recommend the disc to anyone interested in the subject or the capacity of films to make history live for audiences. Apparently like several other reviewers here, I first saw &quot;Nicholas and Alexandra&quot; in its initial theatrical release and loved it. I immediately read Massie's book after seeing it, which was the first step in what has proven a life-long interest in the period. Despite its failings, it is a testament to the film's power that it can exercise this level of fascination over viewers' imaginations.",4,Making History Live,980467200,"01 26, 2001",2001,3183,"['One', 'most', 'beautifully', 'crafted', 'moody', 'epics', 'come', 'Hollywood', 'be', 'accurate', 'Britain', 'quot', 'Nicholas', 'Alexandra', 'quot', 'never', 'acquired', 'reputation', 'Released', 'time', 'when', 'big', 'budget', 'spectaculars', 'were', 'considered', 'pass', 'eacute', 'hostile', 'contemporary', 'reviews', 'have', 'shaped', 'film', 'reputation', 'hardly', 'perfect', 'film', 'nonetheless', 'reasonably', 'accurate', 'politically', 'conservative', 'overview', 'pre-revolutionary', 'Russia', 'excellent', 'job', 'individualizing', 'two', 'monarchs.The', 'two', 'central', 'completely', 'convincing', 'performances', 'are', 'relative', 'unknowns', 'Michael', 'Jayston', 'Janet', 'Suzman', 'Several', 'first-rate', 'actors', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'Eric', 'Porter', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'Alan', 'Webb', 'Harry', 'Andrews', 'Irene', 'Worth', 'Jack', 'Hawkins', 'Michael', 'Redgrave', 'John', 'McEnery', 'Curt', 'Jurgens', 'others', 'support', 'small', 'parts', 'manage', 'make', 'forget', 'familiar', 'presences', 'concentrate', 'characters', 'actors', 'are', 'cushioned', 'Yvonne', 'Blake', 'Antonio', 'Castillo', 'lush', 'costumes', 'Richard', 'Rodney', 'Bennett', 'symphonic', 'score', 'elegant', 'jewelry', 'box', 'crafted', 'designer', 'John', 'Box', 'cinematographer', 'Freddie', 'Young', 'director', 'Franklin', 'Schaffner.The', 'film', 'two', 'major', 'failings', 'First', 'just', 'touch', '*too*', 'sympathetic', 'monarchs', 'Quite', 'apart', 'lack', 'evaluation', 'short-comings', 'leaders', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'scenes', 'calculated', 'presumably', 'questionably', 'demonstrate', 'Nicholas', 'quot', 'learning', 'quot', 'mistakes', 'Second', 'effort', 'dramatize', 'complex', 'historical', 'moment', 'simply', 'too', 'much', 'jump', 'Russo-Japanese', 'War', '1905', 'Russian', 'Revolution', 'Stolypin', 'reforms', 'Rasputin', 'influence', 'First', 'World', 'War', 'Februrary', 'Revolution', 'October', 'Revolution', 'rush', 'include', 'everything', 'little', 'other', 'monarchs', 'lives', 'dealt', 'depth', 'efforts', 'depict', 'revolutionaries', 'are', 'particularly', 'awkward.One', 'most', 'notorious', 'scenes', 'film', 'commented', 'more', 'one', 'contemporary', 'review', 'brief', 'early', 'moment', 'when', 'Lenin', 'journalist', 'quot', 'Pay', 'attention', ""'re"", 'see', 'birth', 'Bolshevik', 'party.', 'quot', 'level', 'political', 'evaluation', 'one', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'scene', 'ten', 'minutes', 'elsewhere', 'was', 'cut', 'subsequent', 'theatrical', 'video', 'release', 'other', 'hand', 'characterization', 'Lenin', 'intolerant', 'prig', 'however', 'uncomprehending', 'political', 'ideas', 'ring', 'remarkably', 'true', 'DVD', 'excisions', 'transfer', 'considerably', 'warmer', 'Columbia', 'previous', 'video', 'releases', '16:9', 'enhanced.I', 'recommend', 'disc', 'anyone', 'interested', 'subject', 'capacity', 'films', 'make', 'history', 'live', 'audiences', 'Apparently', 'several', 'other', 'reviewers', 'here', 'first', 'saw', 'quot', 'Nicholas', 'Alexandra', 'quot', 'initial', 'theatrical', 'release', 'loved', 'immediately', 'read', 'Massie', 'book', 'seeing', 'was', 'first', 'step', 'what', 'proven', 'life-long', 'interest', 'period', 'failings', 'testament', 'film', 'power', 'can', 'exercise', 'level', 'fascination', 'viewers', 'imaginations']",N/A

I would say that this story of the Czar Nicholas II be watched after perhaps a brush-up on the Russian history, as it is a fairly confusing story. The movie tells the real-life story of the last Russian czar, the last of the Romanovs, and his wife, Alexandra, and their family toubles. Their son, Alexis, has a blood disease transferred by interbreeding, our teacher said. This led to Alexandra searching for help, finding it in the monk Rasputin.  The story follows about twenty years of Russian history. It is a long story, but a rewarding one. Unfortunately, it is very depressing, and the ending is a long one, as it is just a wait for the inevitable. The movie is a basicly depressing film, I found. The Russian citizens were put through a lot, this movie seems, while the Czar is more occupied with his son than the country ! I am rather interested in the subject, as it keeps popping up over the years. The Anastasia debacle was big several years ago, and there is also a controversy of whether the Romanovs were extermined so many years ago, or were saved.

19018,ATYKXNLVOZN02,0767827775,Constant Viewer,"[7, 12]","Robert Massie's _Nicholas and Alexandra_ (1968), the book on which this film is based, enjoyed great popular success but suffers from one major flaw.  Massie's own son is hemophiliac, and his view of Alexandra, really the pivotal figure in this saga, was inevitably shaped by firsthand experience of his wife's emotional turmoil as the mother responsible for her son's illness. Massie thus regarded Alexandra with great sympathy and his account heavily favors her.  Until the late 1990s most writings about the Romanovs followed Massie: Alexandra's emotional excesses were excused as those of a distraught mother who could not escape her guilt and grief.With the collapse of the Soviet regime in 1989, previously unknown Russian archival materials became available to historians and a drastically revised picture of Alexandra appeared.  Letters and diaries from Russian political figures, members of the imperial court, and the Romanov family prove that she was deeply disliked and mistrusted by most people around her.  She was cripplingly shy by nature (as the film amply shows), but unduly confident in her limited abilities as a political observer.  Her health suffered as a result of worry over Alexei's health, but she used her illness to control those around her, particularly her children.  She was demanding and emotionally distant from her daughters, and her obsessive watchfulness over Alexei kept him, like his sisters, isolated from other children and incapable of developing the social skills appropriate to their ages.  Letters between Nicholas and Alexandra reveal her hectoring attitude toward him, which historians now attribute to her early experience of dominant women, especially her grandmother Queen Victoria.  Alexandra lacked Victoria's intelligence and the sound political sense her grandmother developed during a lifetime at the center of political life in England, but the empress none the less considered herself cast in the same mold.Against these sharply revised pictures of Nicholas and Alexandra, the portraits offered in this film now seem quaint and outdated.  The film is a brilliant visual spectacle, delighting the eye with sumptuous interiors, rich costumes and spectacular jewelry.  But its picture of late Tsarist Russian society is skewed by the omission of any reference to the flourishing middle-class urban culture that produced the works of Petr Tchaikovsky and Maxim Gorky.  We see the luxury in which the nobility lived, and the abject poverty of the workers; but while Massie's book gives full attention to Russian culture in Nicholas II's reign, the film omits it entirely.Dramatically speaking, the film is turgid and confusing.  Goldman was a gifted screenwriter, his abilities demonstrated in ""The Lion in Winter"" (based on his own play), but ""Nicholas and Alexandra"" achieves the level of ""Lion"" in only 2 scenes. After Alexei has run his sled downstairs and into a closed door, Goldman sensitively extends the conversation between Nicholas and his son into a dialogue between the deposed and disgraced Tsar and his lost empire, Russia itself.  A second scene is noted below.  The rest of the film is not up to these levels.We never have a worthwhile understanding of the relationship between Tsar and Empress.  We see them endlessly pledging undying love for each other, or sniping about Rasputin or the way Nicholas ought to run the empire, but little of substance arises from these usually tedious conversations.  We learn almost more about their relationship from a conversation Nicholas has not with his wife, but with his mother shortly before his abdication (""You can't say no to your wife!""). The film deals more convincingly with Alexandra's relationship with Rasputin, as most easily seen in their first meeting at the dowager empress's birthday party; here we can really understand how Rasputin played so deftly on Alexandra's fears.Goldman has a casual attitude to historical chronology, which he seems to alter for dramatic effect even though the record is dramatic enough in itself. I suspect he put Alexei's near-fatal illness at Spala just before the outbreak of WWI in 1914 (the Spala episode was really in 1912) to juxtapose the boy's recovery, and Rasputin's consequent vindication, with the war during which Alexandra obediently appointed inept ministers whom Rasputin recommended, men in whose hands the Tsar's government collapsed in 1917.  But if this was Goldman's intention, he didn't make it at all clear to viewers.Other than Nicholas, Alexandra, Rasputin and the dowager empress, few figures in this drama are fully fleshed out.  Even Laurence Olivier's role seems intended only to do what is expected of him, to enunciate some opposition to Tsarist autocracy.  For all Olivier's immense gifts and the humanity with which he invests Witte, the character is basically static. The children, even Alexei, are cardboard cutouts, with the girls doing hardly anything more than we would expect high-spirited but isolated young women to do.  Anyone who has read Massie's book will recognize their words and actions in this film as no more than echoes, in dialogue, of exactly what Massie says about the Grand Duchesses. (His descriptions of them and their personalities are only very slightly paraphrased from printed memoirs of those who served the Romanov family before 1917.  Most of these memoirs were deeply invested in painting a rosy picture of the family life of the last Tsar and Empress, but their statements have been profoundly altered by Russian archival materials now available.  It is curious, moreover, that Massie omitted some negative comments from those memoirs, one of which states that the 2 oldest girls, Olga and Tatiana, could be heard speaking with each other as if 10 years old, even when they were grown women, and the statement by Alexandra's chief lady-in-waiting that all 5 of the children ""behaved generally like young savages."")The exception is a scene Goldman invented showing Tatiana exposing herself to a young guardsman who happens to pass by the open door to their room while she is dressing. It is perhaps shocking, but surely no more so than evidence historians have recently found that during a snap visit to the Ipatiev house in Ekaterinburg on June 27, 1918, officials found Grand Duchess Marie (the 3rd daughter) in a compromising situation with a guardsman named Ivan Sokhodokov. Goldman could not have known of this; documents alleging it were not known until after 1989.  But that he invented the scene involving Tatiana's exposure shows that he had a sense of the frustration and despair these young women felt as they endured imprisonment and faced death. Though his scene involves the wrong Grand Duchess, Goldman's dramatic sensibilities here were indeed on track.Exactly what ""situation"" Marie was found in is not described in detail in any document, but the discovery proved that security at the Ipatiev house had become unreliable. This realization combined with the approach of the White Army to Ekaterinburg led directly to the decision to execute the family 3 weeks later. The execution sequence is excruciatingly drawn out as the family sit, seemingly endlessly, in the notorious basement room waiting for their captors to begin the move to a safer location (the cover story they were told when they were roused from bed).  Then the gunfire is over so quickly that the viewer is left uncertain of what is supposed to be happening. (In fact it took the inept firing squad some 20 minutes to kill all 7 members of the family and the 4 servants who were still with them.)  Nothing is shown or said about the alleged survival of Grand Duchess Anastasia, the youngest daughter, who was still the subject of much discussion when Massie wrote and when the film was made.",3,"Delightful spectacle, disappointing drama",1163721600,"11 17, 2006",2006,7795,"['Robert', 'Massie', '_Nicholas', 'Alexandra_', '1968', 'book', 'film', 'based', 'enjoyed', 'great', 'popular',

Reminiscent of the originalDoctor Zhivago (Two-Disc Special Edition), this lavishly produced, beautifully colored 1970s film version of Robert Massie's biography of the Tsar and his family is pleasant enough, and has all the alleged history in perfect order. It won tons of awards, yet it isn't a typical classic ... more of an atypical classic with a cult following.Also, I do not care for the way author Massie presents his facts.The acting could have been better (the fellow playing Tsar Nicholas is frankly repugnant) but one cannot fail to LOVE Tom Baker in his first real big-time starring role as Gregory Rasputin, creepy and funny as hell at all times. Baker modelled his work after Christopher Lee's masterful turn inRasputin: Mad Monk(see my review).But Lee's earlier version was 100% messed up history. Baker was frighteningly real--especially when they try to murder him and he peeps up at Prince Yussupov with those evil, bulging eyes!

19024,A364VIQ3KLAWVX,0767827775,H. M Pyles,"[102, 107]","The unadulturated history of the Russian monarchy has produced more compelling drama than anything Hollywood could produce in its wildest flights:  Ivan the Terrible's descent into madness; Peter the Great's violent childhood and adult retributions (including the murder of his son) as the backdrop for supreme political accomplishments; Catherine the Great's seizure of a throne from a madman and her emergence as the dominant monarch of her age; Alexander I's possible complicity in the assasination of his father, his defeat of Napoleon, and likely faking of his death to live out his life as a religious hermit; Alexander II's death at the hands of terrorists.  And the curtain drops on the Russian monarchy much as the play ran -- in pools of blood.  The main difference in the Nicholas and Alexandra saga is that their predecessors created their own dramas, whereas Nicholas and Alexandra succumbed to the drama of events swirling around them.This movie is inaccurate in many details.  For instance, the real Dowager Empress visited her son on his train only after his abdication, not in the weeks before the monarchy fell.  Anna Vyrobuva, a signficant and unwittingly sinister player in the Rasputin debacle, is missing.  And the loyalty to the Tsar professed by the other Romanovs in the movie glosses over the fact that there were serious family discussions about a coup to send Alexandra into exile and maybe even to remove Nicholas himself.But these are nits.  In a larger sense the movie compellingly captures the essence of the two fundamental issues that combined to bring the Romanov dynasty crashing down.  The first had to do with Nicholas.  He was a kind, gentle family man much more suited to the life of a country gentleman.  When called upon to exercise real power to influence complex events, he fell into a pattern of posturing, denial, and a passive belief that he could just go with his reactionary biases instead of with disciplined examination of reality.  After all, God had made him emperor, and therefore it must be God's will that he felt and decided as he did.The other issue had to do with Alexandra.  A shy, high-strung woman who was equipped neither by temperament, intellect, nor upbringing to ride herd on a decadent court or fractious nest of in-laws, she inclined to a mystical view of religion and monarchy that could rise almost to hysteria.  It would have been a volatile situation in the best of circumstances.  But Alexandra got dealt a very bad hand.  Russia was opening up culturally and intellectually and looking to unshackle itself from unthinking political and religious orthodoxy.  And she was failing in her principle purpose -- to produce a male heir to the greatest throne on earth.  Nearing menopause after bearing four daughters, she finally bore a son, only to find him cursed by the hoemophila that ran through her relations.  She had offended God, and she had to know why.Alexandra responded with a downward spiral into an increasingly bizarre mysticism that further clouded her husband's foggy view of his world and his role -- and that ultimately opened the door to perhaps the most bizarre case of malign political influence in the annals of government:  Rasputin.While botching a detail here and there, the movie does a marvelous job of accurately portraying the salient aspects of how these things ate away at Nicholas' real power to replace it with a mushrooming fantasy of power as he, and Alexandra even moreso, perceived it.  Although ruling one-sixth of the world's land surface, the couple's world view finally came to extend no further than the small circle of their tight-knit immediate family and their gilded enclave at Tsarskoye Selo.When the revolution came -- as Nicholas's fatalism and the insane yielding to Rasputin's interference in government made inevitable -- Nicholas actually entered a few months of calm that on some level were the most peaceful of his life.  Power scared and exhausted him.  The shackles of jailers were light compared to those of a throne.The fact that the revolution that deepened his country's enslavement actually freed Nicholas from those things he most abhorred illustrate just how far the Romanov dynasty had come to odds with the very purpose of its existence.  In the end, Nicholas and Alexandra showed a grace and sanguinity in captivity and extermination that was utterly absent when they ruled the world's largest country.  No scriptwriter could improve on this script, and the great art of this movie is that none tried.",5,History as Drama,1104969600,"01 6, 2005",2005,4538,"['unadulturated', 'history', 'Russian', 'monarchy', 'produced', 'more', 'compelling', 'drama', 'anything', 'Hollywood', 'could', 'produce', 'wildest', 'flights', 'Ivan', 'Terrible', 'descent', 'madness', 'Peter', 'Great', 'violent', 'childhood', 'adult', 'retributions', 'including', 'murder', 'son', 'backdrop', 'supreme', 'political', 'accomplishments', 'Catherine', 'Great', 'seizure', 'throne', 'madman', 'emergence', 'dominant', 'monarch', 'age', 'Alexander', 'possible', 'complicity', 'assasination', 'father', 'defeat', 'Napoleon', 'likely', 'faking', 'death', 'live', 'out', 'life', 'religious', 'hermit', 'Alexander', 'II', 'death', 'hands', 'terrorists', 'curtain', 'drops', 'Russian', 'monarchy', 'much', 'play', 'ran', 'pools', 'blood', 'main', 'difference', 'Nicholas', 'Alexandra', 'saga', 'predecessors', 'created', 'own', 'dramas', 'whereas', 'Nicholas', 'Alexandra', 'succumbed', 'drama', 'events', 'swirling', 'them.This', 'movie', 'inaccurate', 'many', 'details', 'instance', 'real', 'Dowager', 'Empress', 'visited', 'son', 'train', 'only', 'abdication', 'not', 'weeks', 'monarchy', 'fell', 'Anna', 'Vyrobuva', 'signficant', 'unwittingly', 'sinister', 'player', 'Rasputin', 'debacle', 'missing', 'loyalty', 'Tsar', 'professed', 'other', 'Romanovs', 'movie', 'fact', 'were', 'serious', 'family', 'discussions', 'coup', 'send', 'Alexandra', 'exile', 'maybe', 'even', 'remove', 'Nicholas', 'himself.But', 'are', 'nits', 'larger', 'sense', 'movie', 'compellingly', 'essence', 'two', 'fundamental', 'issues', 'combined', 'bring', 'Romanov', 'dynasty', 'crashing', 'down', 'first', 'had', 'do', 'Nicholas', 'was', 'kind', 'gentle', 'family', 'man', 'much', 'more', 'suited', 'life', 'country', 'gentleman', 'When', 'called', 'exercise', 'real', 'power', 'influence', 'complex', 'events', 'fell', 'pattern', 'posturing', 'denial', 'passive', 'belief', 'could', 'just', 'go', 'reactionary', 'biases', 'instead', 'disciplined', 'examination', 'reality', 'God', 'had', 'made', 'emperor', 'must', 'be', 'God', 'will', 'felt', 'decided', 'other', 'issue', 'had', 'do', 'Alexandra', 'A', 'shy', 'high-strung', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'equipped', 'neither', 'temperament', 'intellect', 'upbringing', 'ride', 'herd', 'decadent', 'court', 'fractious', 'nest', 'in-laws', 'inclined', 'mystical', 'view', 'religion', 'monarchy', 'could', 'rise', 'almost', 'hysteria', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'volatile', 'situation', 'best', 'circumstances', 'Alexandra', 'got', 'very', 'bad', 'hand', 'Russia', 'was', 'opening', 'up', 'culturally', 'intellectually', 'looking', 'unshackle', 'unthinking', 'political', 'religious', 'orthodoxy', 'was', 'failing', 'principle', 'purpose', 'produce', 'male', 'heir', 'greatest', 'throne', 'earth', 'Nearing', 'menopause', 'bearing', 'four', 'daughters', 'finally', 'bore', 'son', 'only', 'find', 'cursed', 'hoemophila', 'ran', 'relations', 'had', 'offended', 'God', 'had', 'know', 'why.Alexandra', 'responded', 'downward', 'spiral', 'increasingly', 'bizarre', 'mysticism', 'further', 'clouded', 'husband', 'foggy', 'view', 'world', 'role', 'ultimately', 'opened', 'door', 'perhaps', 'most', 'bizarre', 'case', 'malign', 'political', 'influence', 'annals', 'government', 'Rasputin.While', 'botching', 'detail', 'here', 'there', 'movie', 'marvelous', 'job', 'accurately', 'portraying', 'salient', 'aspects', 'how', 'things', 'ate', 'away', 'Nicholas', 'real', 'power', 'replace', 'mushrooming', 'fantasy', 'power', 'Alexandra', 'even', 'moreso', 'perceived', 'ruling', 'one-sixth', 'world', 'land', 'surface', 'couple', 'world', 'view', 'finally', 'came', 'extend', 'further', 'small', 'circle', 'tight-knit', 'immediate', 'family', 'gilded', 'enclave', 'Tsarskoye', 'Selo.When', 'revolution', 'came', 'Nicholas', 'fatalism', 'insane', 'yielding', 'Rasputin', 'interference', 'government', 'made', 'inevitable', 'Nicholas', 'actually', 'entered', 'few', 'months', 'calm', 'level', 'were', 'most', 'peaceful', 'life', 'Power', 'scared', 'exhausted', 'shackles', 'jailers', 'were', 'light', 'compared', 'throne.The', 'fact', 'revolution', 'deepened', 'country', 'enslavement', 'actually', 'freed', 'Nicholas', 'things', 'most', 'abhorred', 'illustrate', 'just', 'how', 'far', 'Romanov', 'dynasty', 'had', 'come', 'odds', 'very', 'purpose', 'existence', 'end', 'Nicholas', 'Alexandra', 'showed', 'grace', 'sanguinity', 'captivity', 'extermination', 'was', 'utterly', 'absent', 'when', 'ruled', 'world', 'largest', 'country', 'scriptwriter', 'could', 'improve', 'script', 'great', 'art', 'movie', 'none', 'tried']",N/A

A 3-hour epic, it begins slowly but picks up steam as the personal drama of the Romanov family and the larger drama of a swiftly changing Russia unfold.I can't vouch for its accuracy, but most historical films condense and play with the facts somewhat. What it is above all is an incredibly satisfying dramatic entertainment. The actors are all excellent, playing historical characters like the tsar and tsarina, the revolutionaries Lenin and Trotsky, and the manipulative monk Rasputin. The camera work is elegant, the costuming sumptuous. Historical events are depicted vividly and with great dramatic sweep. The musical score by Richard Rodney Bennett is majestic and haunting. Kudos to director Franklin Schaffner.I assume most folks know it doesn't go well for the Romanovs (spoiler alert). The final scene, filmed at a slow pace and almost in silence except for the nerve-wracking ticking of a clock, is both gut- and heart-wrenching. I can't imagine any filmmaker today taking the time to build the intensity of a scene like that. Nicholas may have been responsible for the misery and death of millions of Russians but he is depicted here as more clueless than ruthless. Despite his misrule, the story drew me so tightly into his family drama that their fate left me quite wrung out.

We see Nicholas and Alexandra in a tender moment with their newborn son, before they learn of his hemophilia, Lenin with his wife helping to start the Bolshevik Party, the Tsar's daughters in a moment of light hearted play, a sweet family discussion between the Tsar, Empress, and their children, and a tense encounter between one of the daughters and a prison guard in Siberia, plus several more scenes.

I was tremendously disappointed at the time, but recently decided to try it again on DVD.  Unfortunately, thirty-five-plus years did nothing to improve it.On the positive side, as a number of other reviewers have noted, it appears for the most part to be historically accurate (though the scene in which one of the Grand Duchesses -- the fact that one can't remember which one says something about the depth of characterization -- bares her breasts to a young guard because she wants a man to desire her is both culturally anachronistic and an insult to the memory of the murdered young woman in question).The problems are numerous.  They include:  a clumsy, leaden script, a ""grand"" style of direction which manages to turn even intimate moments into turgid tableux, and for the most part truly terrible acting, with Jayston's Nicholas the worst offender on this score -- he leans toward the bug-eyed, immobile school of emoting.  For a film which sells itself in part as historical spectacle, it also has a remarkably cheesy look for the most part -- interiors are consistently overlit, which gives them a fake appearance, and the Tsar's palaces seem remarkably understaffed.This is one to rent before you invest in purchasing the DVD.

You may or may not be interested in Russian history or even world history, but this particular story greatly encapsulates the emotional, physical and political issues faced by two powerfully-born adults and their children. Other reviews at this site are terrific for their critical perceptions of this movie and its strengths and weaknesses, so I will not go into too much detail to ""sell"" anybody on the action or dialogue, or historical accuracy. Suffice to say this movie -- in its unedited version (crucial for DVD) does in fact tell it like it is (or was). Nicholas and Alexandra were two human beings who happened to be born into the Western dynastic system still prevalent at the turn of the 20th century. They were responsible, in an almost Biblical sense, for the destiny of Humanity, only they opted out, and were then executed. This would be considered ""romantic"" if Humanity did not have such an overwhelming need for Leadership by designated heroes. The DVD version is critical to see the full relationship between Alexandria and Rasputin as a surrendering of power, and also to see Rasputin in his full decadent expression (which must be positively repulsive to Russian history revisionists.) It is also necessary, in an emotional and historic context, to see the ""failure"" of Nicholas -- that he could no longer carry the responsibility of the godhead. It is also relevant to see the execution of Rasputin at the hands of the two hop-head fairies who were also in line to inherit this godhead, and that they themselves had dreams of American incorporation. Alexia (Nicholas and Alexandra's only son, who also happened to be a hemophiliac) hates his persecutors with a very personal, adult hatred -- those who persecuted the Romanov dynasty were people who hated themselves and took that hatred out on the leaders they loved and despised. They loved their leaders, and despised their need for leaders.

19046,A3FVF3T2HKQES7,0767827775,"MICHAEL STODGHILL ""FILM COLLECTOR""","[3, 3]","&#34;Nicholas and Alexandra&#34;(1971) is one of the last epics that Hollywood liked making in the Fifties(&#34;The Ten Commandments&#34;, &#34;Ben-Hur&#34;) and Sixties(&#34;Lawrence of Arabia&#34;, &#34;Doctor Zhivago&#34;) to lure audiences back in the theaters because of television. Produced by Sam Spiegel it certainly lives up to the title of an Epic film. When you think of the epic film, the first person(or director) that comes to mind is David Lean. After watching this new Blu-ray of &#34;Nicholas and Alexandra&#34; from Twilight Time, he's the first person I thought of. Lean had nothing to do with &#34;Nicholas and Alexandra&#34; but he did work with Sam Spiegel and it's easy to see Lean's influence. In fact, many of the fine craftsman that worked with Lean such as cinematographer Freddie Young and art director John Box worked on &#34;Nicholas and Alexandra&#34; and they really bring the story to life. It's a beautiful looking film and looks absolutely gorgeous in this new Blu ray presentation from Twilight Time. The story covers the last fourteen years in the turbulent reign of Russia's last Tsar, Nicholas II and his German-born wife Alexandra from the birth of their only son in 1904 to the execution of the entire family(and the end of the Romanov era) in 1918. It's hard to feel sorry for them with so many Russians dying of starvation and disease while they live a life of extravagance and luxury. That lifestyle is brought out even more in this Blu-ray presentation. It's not often that the sets, costumes and locations overwhelm a film and it's actors but that's certainly the case here. &#34;Nicholas and Alexandra&#34; looks beautiful on Blu-ray and Twilight Time deserves a lot of credit for restoring this epic that really dazzles the eyes. It won richly deserved Oscars for Box's art direction and set decoration as well as it's gorgeous costumes(by Yvonne Blake and Antonio Castillo). And what costumes! This new Blu-ray brings out the smallest details. Reds, blues, greens, whites, purples just pop off the screen. Freddie Young's location and countryside scenes are simply stunning to say the least. The acting is top notch with a who's who of British film and stage performers such as Harry Andrews, Jack Hawkins, Michael Redgrave and Laurence Olivier to name a few. It's too bad Hollywood doesn't make epics like this anymore. Except for &#34;Gandhi&#34;(1982) and &#34;The Last Emperor&#34;(1987) it's doubtful that we'll see anything as lavish as &#34;Nicholas and Alexandra&#34; ever again. Until then, this new Blu-ray from Twilight Time comes highly recommended. &#34;Nicholas and Alexandra&#34; is 189 minutes(Aspect Ratio: 2.35:1) and only contains the following subtitles: English SDH. Audio is only English 1.0 DTS-HD MA. Special features include three short featurettes on the making of the film, an isolated music score(Richard Rodney Bennett) and the Original Theatrical Trailer. Anyone who enjoys the epic films of the past will certain enjoy Twilight Time's stunning Blu-ray of &#34;Nicholas and Alexandra&#34;.",5,A ROYAL BLU RAY PRESENTATION FROM TWILIGHT TIME,1386288000,"12 6, 2013",2013,3068,"['34', 'Nicholas', 'Alexandra', '34', '1971', 'one', 'last', 'epics', 'Hollywood', 'liked', 'making', 'Fifties', '34', 'Ten', 'Commandments', '34', '34', 'Ben-Hur', '34', 'Sixties', '34', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', '34', '34', 'Doctor', 'Zhivago', '34', 'lure', 'audiences', 'back', 'theaters', 'television', 'Produced', 'Sam', 'Spiegel', 'certainly', 'up', 'title', 'Epic', 'film', 'When', 'think', 'epic', 'film', 'first', 'person', 'director', 'mind', 'David', 'Lean', 'watching', 'new', 'Blu-ray', '34', 'Nicholas', 'Alexandra', '34', 'Twilight', 'Time', 'first', 'person', 'thought', 'Lean', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', '34', 'Nicholas', 'Alexandra', '34', 'did', 'work', 'Sam', 'Spiegel', 'easy', 'see', 'Lean', 'influence', 'fact', 'many', 'fine', 'craftsman', 'worked', 'Lean', 'such', 'cinematographer', 'Freddie', 'Young', 'art', 'director', 'John', 'Box', 'worked', '34', 'Nicholas', 'Alexandra', '34', 'really', 'bring', 'story', 'life', 'beautiful', 'looking', 'film', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'new', 'Blu', 'ray', 'presentation', 'Twilight', 'Time', 'story', 'last', 'fourteen', 'years', 'turbulent', 'reign', 'Russia', 'last', 'Tsar', 'Nicholas', 'II', 'German-born', 'wife', 'Alexandra', 'birth', 'only', 'son', '1904', 'execution', 'entire', 'family', 'end', 'Romanov', 'era', '1918', 'hard', 'feel', 'sorry', 'so', 'many', 'Russians', 'dying', 'starvation', 'disease', 'live', 'life', 'extravagance', 'luxury', 'lifestyle', 'brought', 'out', 'even', 'more', 'Blu-ray', 'presentation', 'not', 'often', 'sets', 'costumes', 'locations', 'overwhelm', 'film', 'actors', 'certainly', 'case', 'here', '34', 'Nicholas', 'Alexandra', '34', 'beautiful', 'Blu-ray', 'Twilight', 'Time', 'lot', 'credit', 'restoring', 'epic', 'really', 'eyes', 'won', 'richly', 'deserved', 'Oscars', 'Box', 'art', 'direction', 'set', 'decoration', 'as', 'well', 'gorgeous', 'costumes', 'Yvonne', 'Blake', 'Antonio', 'Castillo', 'what', 'new', 'Blu-ray', 'out', 'smallest', 'details', 'Reds', 'blues', 'greens', 'whites', 'purples', 'just', 'pop', 'off', 'screen', 'Freddie', 'Young', 'location', 'countryside', 'scenes', 'are', 'simply', 'stunning', 'say', 'least', 'acting', 'top', 'notch', 'who', 'who', 'British', 'film', 'stage', 'performers', 'such', 'Harry', 'Andrews', 'Jack', 'Hawkins', 'Michael', 'Redgrave', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'name', 'few', 'too', 'bad', 'Hollywood', ""n't"", 'make', 'epics', 'anymore', '34', 'Gandhi', '34', '1982', '34', 'Last', 'Emperor', '34', '1987', 'doubtful', ""'ll"", 'see', 'anything', 'as', 'lavish', '34', 'Nicholas', 'Alexandra', '34', 'ever', 'again', 'then', 'new', 'Blu-ray', 'Twilight', 'Time', 'highly', 'recommended', '34', 'Nicholas', 'Alexandra', '34', '189', 'minutes', 'Aspect', 'Ratio', '2.35:1', 'only', 'following', 'subtitles', 'English', 'SDH', 'Audio', 'only', 'English', '1.0', 'DTS-HD', 'MA', 'Special', 'features', 'include', 'three', 'short', 'featurettes', 'making', 'film', 'isolated', 'music', 'score', 'Richard', 'Rodney', 'Bennett', 'Original', 'Theatrical', 'Trailer', 'Anyone', 'who', 'epic', 'films', 'past', 'will', 'certain', 'enjoy', 'Twilight', 'Time', 'stunning', 'Blu-ray', '34', 'Nicholas', 'Alexandra', '34']",N/A

19048,A3EPHBMU07LZ50,0767827775,Mysterious Reviewer,"[2, 2]","Nicholas and Alexandria was filmed the way movies used to be made. Good writing, good music, good acting and the violent scenes are filmed with a minimum amount of gore. Yes, you will find violent scenes in this movie, as we all know how the family dies, but the violence was appropriately displayed. I would not recommend this movie for children due to the inherently violent nature of this story, but the story presented the violent scenes with care.As to the pacing:  This is an old-style film where the scenes and characters actions may seem slow by today's current movie standards. The movie is written and acted as more of a play that's filmed. In fact, you will find an intermission with music during the middle of the film. Back in the day, back when movie theaters used to offer two movies, cartoons and an intermission, a planned movie intermission was a relief. You had a chance to take a break to eat or use the facilities.As to the music and sound quality:  The movie was filmed with a strong music dynamic range. At times the music was very loud and within seconds it was difficult to understand the spoken lines of the actors. I wish the film was a bit more balanced but it was not. I kept my stereo remote handy to catch the spoken words while still being able to enjoy the music.Overall, this is a good movie based on good storytelling.Recommend.",5,The way movies used to be made,1369612800,"05 27, 2013",2013,1363,"['Nicholas', 'Alexandria', 'was', 'filmed', 'way', 'movies', 'used', 'be', 'made', 'Good', 'writing', 'good', 'music', 'good', 'acting', 'violent', 'scenes', 'are', 'filmed', 'minimum', 'amount', 'gore', 'Yes', 'will', 'find', 'violent', 'scenes', 'movie', 'know', 'how', 'family', 'violence', 'was', 'appropriately', 'displayed', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'movie', 'children', 'due', 'inherently', 'violent', 'nature', 'story', 'story', 'presented', 'violent', 'scenes', 'care.As', 'pacing', 'old-style', 'film', 'where', 'scenes', 'characters', 'actions', 'may', 'seem', 'slow', 'today', 'current', 'movie', 'standards', 'movie', 'written', 'acted', 'more', 'play', 'filmed', 'fact', 'will', 'find', 'intermission', 'music', 'middle', 'film', 'Back', 'day', 'back', 'when', 'movie', 'theaters', 'used', 'offer', 'two', 'movies', 'cartoons', 'intermission', 'planned', 'movie', 'intermission', 'was', 'relief', 'had', 'chance', 'take', 'break', 'eat', 'use', 'facilities.As', 'music', 'sound', 'quality', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'strong', 'music', 'dynamic', 'range', 'times', 'music', 'was', 'very', 'loud', 'seconds', 'was', 'difficult', 'understand', 'spoken', 'lines', 'actors', 'wish', 'film', 'was', 'bit', 'more', 'balanced', 'was', 'not', 'kept', 'stereo', 'remote', 'handy', 'catch', 'spoken', 'words', 'still', 'being', 'able', 'enjoy', 'music.Overall', 'good', 'movie', 'based', 'good', 'storytelling.Recommend']",N/A

19051,A2UUYORVIZ00UH,0767827775,Noirdame,"[4, 5]","This is a beautifully filmed epic, but let me forewarn you that it's not always accurate (but then, few are). Michael Jayston and Janet Suzman excel as the doomed Imperial couple, whose love for each other and their children is touching, but whose incapability to rule their country makes them appear insensitive to their subjects. Tom Baker as the infamous Grigory Rasputin fits the bill for the role, and he even manages to insert bits of humor in this much portrayed character. The incomparable Sir Laurence Olivier is impeccable in his turn as Witte. One of the most memorable scenes is the murder of Rasputin, again, somewhat fictionalized but highly watchable and entertaining. Martin Potter (Prince Felix Yussopov) is fascinating and repellent, while Richard Warwick (RIP) as Grand Duke Dmitry is boyishly and deliciously captivating. Irene Worth as the Dowager Empress is so natural, and the majority of the characters (I've noted some exceptions below) came off very well. The reconstruction of Bloody Sunday, WW1, and the execution were expertly presented.However, several scenes (some not included in the video release, but restored on DVD) are fictionalized or downright false. On the DVD, for example, the part where Grand Duchess Tatiana (the late Lynne Fredrick, RIP) exposes herself to a Bolshevik guard in Ekaterinburg is fabricated and ridiculous. The supposed 'attempted suicide' by Alexei was again misrepresented - the actual incident which occurred at Tobolsk was accidental. Yakovlev (Sir Ian Holm) is portrayed as a hating, nasty man, when in actuality, he treated the Czar and his family with the utmost respect, despite his membership with the Bolsheviks. Jacob Yurovsky (Alan Webb) is shown to be a kind, elderly gentleman, which he was most certainly not. The Imperial daughters were not given much to do, and their characters were never fully developed. We pretty much had to guess which daughter each actress was portraying (until the climax), and the actresses did not resemble the real people at all!!! The eldest daughter was too dark-haired, thin-lipped and sharp-featured (not to say that she was unattractive), while the second was the wrong physical type, the third again had hair that was too dark, wrong body type and was too short. The youngest was too tall, and her hair was too light. And those 70s hairstyles!!! I guess I'm too picky, but considering the excellent job of casting with the main characters, they were way off here!!!On the whole, worthwhile viewing, but I recommend that people read biographies of the Romanovs before seeing the movie, and try to get it on DVD if possible. The final scene is hard to watch (at least I thought so) and on the DVD print watch for 'movie mistakes'!!! But don't miss it.

Why were some of the greatest scenes & dialog missing? The movie ""Nicholas & Alexandria"" is a ""Turning Tide"" for many reasons...1st turning tide: watching the movie before reading the bookI saw the movie before reading the book by Robert K. Massie that it was based on, & thought the movie was great. The characters were very real, they were acted by professional Shakespeare & theater actors rather than the standard ""Mega Personalities"" which always gets in the way of historical dramas. The scenes looked ""Real"" enough, even if photographed in Spain rather than Russia, but second thought, maybe I don't know what Russia ""Should"" look like. I was once trapped in the Moscow airport on my way to Kiev Ukraine, so I saw some Slavic lands from the air. Returning to the film after a few years I was surprised to figure out that Rasputin was played by Tom Baker, the 4th Dr. Who, who indeed was a Benedict monk in his early 20's. Then I read the book by Robert K. Massie & a few history books...2nd turning tide: after reading the book & the fall of the Czar state...the movie fell a part; the best parts of history were missing or rearranged. Specially Rasputin's death; there was no dancing transvestite at Prince Yusupov's cellar, & Rusputin didn't crawl away from the room, but ran shouting ""I will tell the Queen Alexandria on you"" with the Prince firing several shots before hitting him. The Prince's friends did not hit Rusputin's body with chains after he was down, but the body was tied with ropes & lowered into an iced river. Believe it or not, Rusputin died from drowning rather than the poison & bullets.The shooting of the Tsar's family had more servants in the firing line & was more gruesome; several people survived the first volley & were chased around with bayonets. Prince Alexis was the last to die with two bullets in the head from a reloaded pistol. Several other bizarre yet important events that would of made great scenes are totally missing from the movie...Yet somehow the movie did ""Flow"" & if you wanted a historical drama rather than a movie it would last way too long like a Wagner opera. Reading some other reviews, the Tsar's family did speak mostly English, & both Nicholas & Alexandria had English & German relatives.

19056,A1BQPKQHV78M8,0767827775,Raul Vasquez,"[7, 11]","Nicholas and Alexandra is a biographical movie, which covers the doomed reign of the last Tsar of Russia. It is based on Robert K. Massie's best selling novel bearing the same name.  The movie begins with the long awaited birth of Alexei, the hemophiliac son of Nicholas II.  It is through Alexei's incurable disease that Nicholas II and his wife Alexandra become involved with the hedonistic peasant Rasputin. Alexandra's dependence on Rasputin's healing powers along with Nicholas's fatalistic approach to life ultimately lead them to making one poor decision after another.  The poor decisions become rather costly to say the least as the results lead to famine and involvement in a World War.  The escalating mayhem in Russia eventually leads to the abdication of the Tsar.  The Tsar willing abdicates only when he becomes convinced that it will not only save the lives of his family but also the soul of Mother Russia from the clutches of the evil revolutionaries.  Unfortunately neither is saved as Russia does indeed fall into the hands of the Communist Bolsheviks and the Royal family is executed by a firing squad.Michael Jayston's portrayal of Nicholas II was astounding! I doubt Nicholas II himself could have done a better job. I have seen movies where great actors (such as Ian McKellen) portray Nicholas II and none of them come close to Jayston's performance. This is a fine example of how the Academy Awards are not always given to the best actor. Anyway, all of the other actors in the movie are quite good as well with a few exceptions. Roderic Noble portrays Alexei as being a cynical and suicidal kid. He comes off very annoying and we all know the real-life life Alexei evoked sympathy rather than contempt. Perhaps for this reason, Roderic Noble did not have much of a screen career. James Hazeldine's portrayal of Stalin is also a bit out of key. I believe a commendable performance goes to Michael Bryant portraying Lenin. His performance surpasses even that of Maximillian Schell's (who is a fine actor) portrayal of Lenin in the 1992 movie ""Stalin"". It is interesting to see the young Brian Cox make an appearance as Leon Trotsky. Finally, Laurence Olivier briefly steals the show as the far-sighted and practical Count Witte.Although I have given the movie 5 stars, it is not without flaws. I think the music soundtrack to the movie is mediocre. Had Jerry Goldsmith (may he rest in peace) scored it, I think the movie would be more well known. Also the assassination of Rasputin is poorly done since it is inaccurate. Prince Yussopov after all, was nervous and not high on opium! A better depiction of the assassination is performed in the Russian movie ""Agoniya"". Finally, in general the second half of the movie sort of fizzles once the First World War starts.The DVD picture quality is first rate, although the 2.0 mono soundtrack is a bit of a let down. It is great that the DVD contains about 15 minutes of restored scenes. Watching the restored scenes, one can easily see why they were deleted. The most bizarre restored scene is where the Grand Duchess Marie flashes one of her captors and says ""do you want to see me?"" Obviously, not historically accurate!By and large a great film that lives in the shadow of its overrated predecessor ""Doctor Zhivago"".",5,Nicholas II brought back to life,1105660800,"01 14, 2005",2005,3288,"['Nicholas', 'Alexandra', 'biographical', 'movie', 'doomed', 'reign', 'last', 'Tsar', 'Russia', 'based', 'Robert', 'K.', 'Massie', 'best', 'selling', 'novel', 'bearing', 'same', 'name', 'movie', 'long', 'awaited', 'birth', 'Alexei', 'hemophiliac', 'son', 'Nicholas', 'II', 'Alexei', 'incurable', 'disease', 'Nicholas', 'II', 'wife', 'Alexandra', 'involved', 'hedonistic', 'peasant', 'Rasputin', 'Alexandra', 'dependence', 'Rasputin', 'healing', 'powers', 'Nicholas', 'fatalistic', 'approach', 'life', 'ultimately', 'lead', 'making', 'one', 'poor', 'decision', 'poor', 'decisions', 'become', 'rather', 'costly', 'say', 'least', 'results', 'lead', 'famine', 'involvement', 'World', 'War', 'escalating', 'mayhem', 'Russia', 'eventually', 'abdication', 'Tsar', 'Tsar', 'willing', 'abdicates', 'only', 'when', 'convinced', 'will', 'not', 'only', 'save', 'lives', 'family', 'also', 'soul', 'Mother', 'Russia', 'clutches', 'evil', 'revolutionaries', 'Unfortunately', 'saved', 'Russia', 'indeed', 'fall', 'hands', 'Communist', 'Bolsheviks', 'Royal', 'family', 'executed', 'firing', 'squad.Michael', 'Jayston', 'portrayal', 'Nicholas', 'II', 'was', 'astounding', 'doubt', 'Nicholas', 'II', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'have', 'seen', 'movies', 'where', 'great', 'actors', 'such', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'portray', 'Nicholas', 'II', 'none', 'come', 'close', 'Jayston', 'performance', 'fine', 'example', 'how', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'given', 'best', 'actor', 'Anyway', 'other', 'actors', 'movie', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'well', 'few', 'exceptions', 'Roderic', 'Noble', 'Alexei', 'being', 'cynical', 'suicidal', 'kid', 'off', 'very', 'annoying', 'know', 'real-life', 'life', 'Alexei', 'evoked', 'sympathy', 'rather', 'contempt', 'Perhaps', 'reason', 'Roderic', 'Noble', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'much', 'screen', 'career', 'James', 'Hazeldine', 'portrayal', 'Stalin', 'also', 'bit', 'key', 'believe', 'commendable', 'performance', 'Michael', 'Bryant', 'portraying', 'Lenin', 'performance', 'surpasses', 'even', 'Maximillian', 'Schell', 'who', 'fine', 'actor', 'portrayal', 'Lenin', '1992', 'movie', 'Stalin', 'interesting', 'see', 'young', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'make', 'appearance', 'Leon', 'Trotsky', 'Finally', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'briefly', 'steals', 'show', 'far-sighted', 'practical', 'Count', 'Witte.Although', 'have', 'given', 'movie', '5', 'stars', 'not', 'flaws', 'think', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'movie', 'mediocre', 'Had', 'Jerry', 'Goldsmith', 'may', 'rest', 'peace', 'scored', 'think', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'well', 'known', 'Also', 'assassination', 'Rasputin', 'poorly', 'done', 'inaccurate', 'Prince', 'Yussopov', 'was', 'nervous', 'not', 'high', 'opium', 'better', 'depiction', 'assassination', 'performed', 'Russian', 'movie', 'Agoniya', 'Finally', 'general', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'sort', 'fizzles', 'once', 'First', 'World', 'War', 'starts.The', 'DVD', 'picture', 'quality', 'first', 'rate', '2.0', 'mono', 'soundtrack', 'bit', 'let', 'down', 'great', 'DVD', '15', 'minutes', 'restored', 'scenes', 'Watching', 'restored', 'scenes', 'one', 'can', 'easily', 'see', 'why', 'were', 'deleted', 'most', 'bizarre', 'restored', 'scene', 'where', 'Grand', 'Duchess', 'Marie', 'one', 'captors', 'do', 'want', 'see', 'Obviously', 'not', 'historically', 'accurate', 'large', 'great', 'film', 'shadow', 'overrated', 'predecessor', 'Doctor', 'Zhivago']",N/A
19057,A1DPP8TXDCHCDN,0767827775,"R. L. Huff ""An old reader""","[1, 1]","This is the fall of the House of Romanov, as interpreted for a 1960s British public. The tragedy of the Russian royals always enjoyed great play in the UK, and by this time there was a mood of revisionism - even in Russia itself - that led to the immense popularity of Robert K. Massie's book and this film version.  The film production has extraordinary values and scale, and is an honestly-conceived epic even if one disagrees with some of its premises.Its purpose is to engage us with the romantic story of the Russian royal couple, with both blinded by love for each other and family to truly perceive the society they ruled. Nicholas was also blinded by the burdens of acting like a Tzar, which meant no nonsense shown to the lower orders.  His screen-version upset at the ""Bloody Sunday"" massacre of 1905 defies the historical record.  In tandem with the general whitewash, one will never hear the word ""pogrom"" in this film, nor any reference to Black Hundreds.  Its depiction of the embattled Kerensky is accurate enough, though Lenin comes across as a cardboard caricature to chill any good Tory spine.  The movie genuflects to its British audience throughout: ""Let's have a system like the British!"" Kerensky declaims. ""I don't care if the Tzar is shooting grouse in Scotland!""  The Dickensian scene of oppressed workers in St. Petersburg also bows to British assumptions. It was the very modernity of Russian industry that brought Tzarism to its crisis.The general viewer knows little of this, of course.  The popular conception of the Russian Revolution and the royal couple itself has been dominated by the Massie version in print and film.  It's a good starting point, but limited.  The film doesn't overcome those limitations, but is an honest attempt to recreate time and place.  The tragic end of the Tzar and the royal family can be seen as vengeance for the massacres and wars conducted in his name; while the subsequent fate of those who made the Revolution gives an aura of the Tzar's counter-revenge. Those viewers inclined to demonize Putin's Russia should know that said Federation president is consciously trying to recreate the political order this production romanticizes.",4,Dramatic story covers the basics,1387929600,"12 25, 2013",2013,2199,"['fall', 'House', 'Romanov', 'interpreted', '1960s', 'British', 'public', 'tragedy', 'Russian', 'royals', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'great', 'play', 'UK', 'time', 'was', 'mood', 'revisionism', 'even', 'Russia', 'led', 'immense', 'popularity', 'Robert', 'K.', 'Massie', 'book', 'film', 'version', 'film', 'production', 'extraordinary', 'values', 'scale', 'honestly-conceived', 'epic', 'even', 'one', 'premises.Its', 'purpose', 'engage', 'romantic', 'story', 'Russian', 'royal', 'couple', 'blinded', 'love', 'other', 'family', 'truly', 'perceive', 'society', 'ruled', 'Nicholas', 'was', 'also', 'blinded', 'burdens', 'acting', 'Tzar', 'meant', 'nonsense', 'shown', 'lower', 'orders', 'screen-version', 'upset', 'Bloody', 'Sunday', 'massacre', '1905', 'defies', 'historical', 'record', 'tandem', 'general', 'whitewash', 'one', 'will', 'never', 'hear', 'word', 'pogrom', 'film', 'reference', 'Black', 'Hundreds', 'depiction', 'embattled', 'Kerensky', 'accurate', 'enough', 'Lenin', 'across', 'cardboard', 'caricature', 'chill', 'good', 'Tory', 'spine', 'movie', 'British', 'audience', 'Let', 'have', 'system', 'British', 'Kerensky', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'Tzar', 'shooting', 'grouse', 'Scotland', 'Dickensian', 'scene', 'oppressed', 'workers', 'St.', 'Petersburg', 'also', 'British', 'assumptions', 'was', 'very', 'modernity', 'Russian', 'industry', 'brought', 'Tzarism', 'crisis.The', 'general', 'viewer', 'little', 'course', 'popular', 'conception', 'Russian', 'Revolution', 'royal', 'couple', 'been', 'dominated', 'Massie', 'version', 'print', 'film', 'good', 'starting', 'point', 'limited', 'film', ""n't"", 'overcome', 'limitations', 'honest', 'attempt', 'recreate', 'time', 'place', 'tragic', 'end', 'Tzar', 'royal', 'family', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'vengeance', 'massacres', 'wars', 'conducted', 'name', 'subsequent', 'fate', 'who', 'made', 'Revolution', 'aura', 'Tzar', 'counter-revenge', 'viewers', 'inclined', 'demonize', 'Putin', 'Russia', 'should', 'know', 'said', 'Federation', 'president', 'consciously', 'trying', 'recreate', 'political', 'order', 'production']",N/A

19069,A3PBLIJGRM4ZJW,0767827775,The Peripatetic Reader,"[0, 0]","This film must be seen to be believed. It has something for everyone. It is a historical drama. It is an epic. It is a costume extravaganza (It won the Oscar for costume design). It is a family drama of an extremely close-knit, slightly dysfunctional family. It is a political drama of a singularly inept, clueless leader at a crucial point in history.It is also highly recommended. Tsar Nicholas II was perhaps the worst possible leader for Russia could have had at that time in history. The film remarkably demonstrates how blissfully unaware Tsar Nicholas was to the needs of the Russian society. The film accurately portrays Nicholas' isolation from the problems in his country, and accurately portrays his personality. Convinced of his own nobility and royal status, he was inept, slow, indecisive, weak, and lacking any real imagination or ability to govern, and had an uncanny ability to make the worst possible decision at the wrong time. This flaccid personality is brilliantly portrayed by Michael Jayston. In this respect, the film is actually a victim of its own merits, because it is painful to watch a bland personality such as Nicholas II for so long during the length of this movie, slightly over three hours. Still, Nicholas and Alexandra is more enjoyable to watch than director Franklin J. Schaffer's previous movie, Patton.Laurence Olivier, Jack Hawkins, and Tom Baker (a.k.a. Dr. Who) all give outstanding supporting performances.",5,A Rewarding Film Experience,1401926400,"06 5, 2014",2014,1451,"['film', 'must', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'believed', 'something', 'everyone', 'historical', 'drama', 'epic', 'costume', 'extravaganza', 'won', 'Oscar', 'costume', 'design', 'family', 'drama', 'extremely', 'close-knit', 'slightly', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'political', 'drama', 'singularly', 'inept', 'clueless', 'leader', 'crucial', 'point', 'history.It', 'also', 'highly', 'recommended', 'Tsar', 'Nicholas', 'II', 'was', 'perhaps', 'worst', 'possible', 'leader', 'Russia', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'time', 'history', 'film', 'remarkably', 'how', 'blissfully', 'unaware', 'Tsar', 'Nicholas', 'was', 'needs', 'Russian', 'society', 'film', 'accurately', 'Nicholas', 'isolation', 'problems', 'country', 'accurately', 'portrays', 'personality', 'Convinced', 'own', 'nobility', 'royal', 'status', 'was', 'inept', 'slow', 'indecisive', 'weak', 'lacking', 'real', 'imagination', 'ability', 'govern', 'had', 'uncanny', 'ability', 'make', 'worst', 'possible', 'decision', 'wrong', 'time', 'flaccid', 'personality', 'brilliantly', 'portrayed', 'Michael', 'Jayston', 'respect', 'film', 'actually', 'victim', 'own', 'merits', 'painful', 'watch', 'bland', 'personality', 'such', 'Nicholas', 'II', 'so', 'long', 'length', 'movie', 'slightly', 'three', 'hours', 'Still', 'Nicholas', 'Alexandra', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'director', 'Franklin', 'J.', 'Schaffer', 'previous', 'movie', 'Patton.Laurence', 'Olivier', 'Jack', 'Hawkins', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'a.k.a', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'give', 'outstanding', 'supporting', 'performances']",N/A

Since his curriculm was  preoccupied with the rise and fall of Communism, this film helped provide  some of the background prior to the Bolshevik Revolution.The Romanovs  are portrayed as being more preoccupied with the health of their  hemophiliac son, Alexi, than with the health of the impoverished Russian  masses. As Rasputin comes on the scene and &quot;heals&quot; the boy, the  Empress persuades the Czar to give increasing influence to this man of  questionable character.

Produced by Sam Spiegel who also producedLawrence of Arabia (Restored Version) [Blu-ray], ""Nicholas and Alexandra"" has all the epic grandeur of that film. The film was nominated for six Oscars and, although it was critically acclaimed at the time, failed to connect with audiences resulting in a disappointing box office return.Directed by Franklin J. Schaffner (Patton [Blu-ray],Planet of the Apes [Blu-ray],The Warlord) from a screenplay by James Goldman (The Lion In Winter) and based on the book Robert Masse, Schaffner makes the film more intimate by focusing on the Tsar and Tsarina's struggle to control their son's hemophillia. Desperately, Alexandra turns to Rasputin (superbly played by ""Doctor Who"" star Tom Baker)to save her son.Set against the backdrop of revolutionary  Russia as it was transformed, ""Nickolas and Alexandra"" humanizes the two main characters who were as flawed as anyone else and, because of their insulated life, often making foolish decisions as rulers only adding to the poverty the masses had to endure.This edition is limited to a pressing of 3000 copies.Twilight Time's Blu-ray release (licensed from Sony)is a very good transfer; the colors positively pop and the film has never looked better with a large amount of detail obscured on the previous DVD release by Sony. There are some minor problems here and there but, on the whole, the film looks very nice indeed.Keep in mind, however, this transfer doesn't look or sound as strong as ""Lawrence of Arabia"" which received an extensive restoration prior to being transferred to Blu-ray.The mono audio sounds superb as well although I'm a bit disappointed that Columbia/Sony didn't redo the audio in a 5.1 mix.It's nice to see Sony providing special features for this set even if they are limited to an isolated stereo soundtrack for the score and three vintage featurettes on the production of the film focusing on the make up for the film, the costumes and the the four actresses playing the royal daughters. We also get the original theatrical trailer.Julie Kirgo provides a terrific overview in a booklet that discusses the difficulty the film ran into (Producer Sam Spiegel at first didn't want to pay the author of the book this is based on because he claimed the story was in public domain: screenwriter James Goldman rewrote the script for a succession of directors before Schaffner arrived recommended by Goldman after the success of ""Patton"": the mixed reviews and indifference of an audience who's taste was changing)and the fact that Spiegel couldn't get his ideal cast due to budget limitations enforced by Columbia.A under rated epic film that manages to balance the epic story of revolutionary Russia as well as the intimate, smaller tragedy of the royal couple's battle to control their son's hemophillia and the often blunderheaded decisions that the couple made while ruling that contributed to their downfall, ""Nicholas and Alexandra"" deserves to be seen by a much larger audience.Recommended.",4,A very nice looking transfer of epic film--it's available from Twilight Time at their website for less (Blu-ray review),1361923200,"02 27, 2013",2013,3168,"['epic', 'story', 'inside', 'view', 'fall', 'ruling', 'Tsar', 'Nicholas', 'Alexandra', 'Patton', 'one', 'last', 'epic', 'films', '1970', 'Produced', 'Sam', 'Spiegel', 'who', 'also', 'producedLawrence', 'Arabia', 'Restored', 'Version', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'Nicholas', 'Alexandra', 'epic', 'grandeur', 'film', 'film', 'was', 'nominated', 'six', 'Oscars', 'was', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'time', 'failed', 'connect', 'audiences', 'resulting', 'disappointing', 'box', 'office', 'return.Directed', 'Franklin', 'J.', 'Schaffner', 'Patton', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'Planet', 'Apes', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'Warlord', 'screenplay', 'James', 'Goldman', 'Lion', 'Winter', 'based', 'book', 'Robert', 'Masse', 'Schaffner', 'film', 'more', 'intimate', 'focusing', 'Tsar', 'Tsarina', 'struggle', 'control', 'son', 'hemophillia', 'Desperately', 'Alexandra', 'Rasputin', 'superbly', 'played', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'star', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'save', 'son.Set', 'backdrop', 'revolutionary', 'Russia', 'was', 'transformed', 'Nickolas', 'Alexandra', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'who', 'were', 'as', 'flawed', 'anyone', 'else', 'insulated', 'life', 'often', 'making', 'foolish', 'decisions', 'rulers', 'only', 'adding', 'poverty', 'masses', 'had', 'endure.This', 'edition', 'limited', 'pressing', '3000', 'copies.Twilight', 'Time', 'Blu-ray', 'release', 'licensed', 'Sony', 'very', 'good', 'transfer', 'colors', 'positively', 'pop', 'film', 'never', 'looked', 'better', 'large', 'amount', 'detail', 'obscured', 'previous', 'DVD', 'release', 'Sony', 'are', 'minor', 'problems', 'here', 'there', 'whole', 'film', 'very', 'nice', 'indeed.Keep', 'mind', 'however', 'transfer', ""n't"", 'look', 'sound', 'as', 'strong', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'received', 'extensive', 'restoration', 'prior', 'being', 'transferred', 'Blu-ray.The', 'mono', 'audio', 'superb', 'as', 'well', ""'m"", 'bit', 'disappointed', 'Columbia/Sony', 'did', ""n't"", 'redo', 'audio', '5.1', 'mix.It', 'nice', 'see', 'Sony', 'providing', 'special', 'features', 'set', 'even', 'are', 'limited', 'isolated', 'stereo', 'soundtrack', 'score', 'three', 'vintage', 'featurettes', 'production', 'film', 'focusing', 'make', 'up', 'film', 'costumes', 'four', 'actresses', 'playing', 'royal', 'daughters', 'also', 'get', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer.Julie', 'Kirgo', 'terrific', 'overview', 'booklet', 'difficulty', 'film', 'ran', 'Producer', 'Sam', 'Spiegel', 'first', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'pay', 'author', 'book', 'based', 'claimed', 'story', 'was', 'public', 'domain', 'screenwriter', 'James', 'Goldman', 'rewrote', 'script', 'succession', 'directors', 'Schaffner', 'arrived', 'recommended', 'Goldman', 'success', 'Patton', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'indifference', 'audience', 'who', 'taste', 'was', 'changing', 'fact', 'Spiegel', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'ideal', 'cast', 'due', 'budget', 'limitations', 'enforced', 'Columbia.A', 'rated', 'epic', 'film', 'balance', 'epic', 'story', 'revolutionary', 'Russia', 'as', 'well', 'intimate', 'smaller', 'tragedy', 'royal', 'couple', 'battle', 'control', 'son', 'hemophillia', 'often', 'blunderheaded', 'decisions', 'couple', 'made', 'ruling', 'contributed', 'downfall', 'Nicholas', 'Alexandra', 'be', 'seen', 'much', 'larger', 'audience.Recommended']",N/A
