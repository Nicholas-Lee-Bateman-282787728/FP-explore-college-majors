If you're only familiar with her work in soaps, this is required viewing.The plot of N&S; is at its strongest when it focuses on the bro-mance between George (Read) and Orry (Swayze).  Orry is my favorite of the two, because he undergoes the most growth of any of the characters, not to mention a degree of savvyness.  When confronted by the twelth successive gang of thugs to harass him once he steps off a train (it's like clockwork), Orry finally has enough and pulls out his cutlass. Swayze, you rock.Be warned, the constant melodrama does grates the nerves after a while.  The villains practically wear have neons signs on their heads blaring, ""EVIL!"" the minute they appear, excepting always Cooper Main (Robert Wagner), a frowning block of wood who is passive-aggressively shoved into his villany.  The cartoonishly evil Elkanah ""West Point!"" Bent is more funny than scary. Though his equally-insane cohort Ashton (Terry Garber) is a delight thanks to Garber's wit and creepy grin.As stated: Lesley-Anne Down is the star, especially in Book Three when her increased screentime takes the sting out of Swayze's absence. The constant cast changes can get downright confusing, also.

Based on the novels by John Jakes, it deals with the life friendship of George Hazard and Orry Main, who befriend each other at West Point Military Academy.  Their friendship brings their families together but nearly tears them apart as the Civil War devides the nation and each other.The story follows each family member of the Hazard and Main clans and how they are affected by events leading up to and after the Civil War.  It is a phenomenal and engrossing epic and I am happy to know that it is now on DVD.Part 3 does not deserve any recognition because it was hastily put together and poorly done.  There was just no way to top what had already been done and since the writers chose to deviate from novel ""Love and War"" 's ending, part 3 became an uneccessary mistake.  Though it is faithful to John Jakes' novel ""Heaven and Hell"", seeing George and Madeline fall in love with each other after their respective spouses have passed away is a negation of Parts 1 and 2.

The sons of two wealthy families meet as cadets at WestPoint Military Academy where they are training to be officers. Orry Main is a true son of the South, raised on a large plantation which owns slaves, while George Hazzard is the son of the owner of an iron works. The young men form an instant and abiding friendship which grows stronger through the years, despite their cultural differences. The first part of the trilogy centres on on the characters from both the North and the South while the second part focuses on the Civil War and on the terrble results of war in a country divided. The third part, and my least favourite, shows the consequences of war and its appalling after effects on a nation and its people, with racial prejudice and hatred causing the formation of the Ku Klux Klan, a truly evil society which fomented bitterness and brutality in the South. The cast of actors was fascinating as it starred faces well known from movies and TV,  all of whom fitted their roles perfectly.

840237,A1V3WAFVE2ZCT2,B0002MFGDC,Carlos R. Pastrana,"[218, 227]","In the age of unimaginative reality TV, boundless and unjustifiable mainstream cynicism and utter ignorance and/or lack of care for history, ""North and South"" stands as somewhat of an anachronism on the shelves of stores nationwide. How pleasant and encouraging, then, to see it rank as such a huge seller in its first week of release!! I have the (guilty) pleasure to admit I watched my Spanish-version of this series, taped off my TV back in 1986, about 10 or 15 times, although I haven't seen it in over decade. I do remember it as one of the two or three greatest mini-series ever (exceeded only by ""Roots"", in my opinion), and (at the time) the most expensive mini-series ever, at over $25 million, although that could hardly cover Al Pacino's salary for ""Angels in America"" nowadays.I also read all three books a long time ago, and am currently in the process of reading them again, also more than a decade later. Given my familiarity with both the books and the filmed version, I am of the opinion that this is one of those rare instances (""Lolita"" being another example) in which, notwithstanding substancial differences between the filmed and written stories, both are classics in their own way. Producers of the mini-series decided, with Jakes' consent, to make the following changes in the story, among many others:1) Do away with Orry's brother Cooper and ""merge"" him with Orry. This was a mistake, I feel, inasmuch as Cooper was a crucial character who represented the more moderate Southerner;2) Not have Orry lose an arm. This probably owed to Hollywood sensitivities, which would not have borne watching Madeline be intimate with a man who lacked one arm;3) Not have Orry die, and give the series a ""Hollywood Ending"". This is because the producers initially did not choose to film Book 3, ""Heaven and Hell"", and thus needed a satisfactory ending to Book 2. If ""Heaven and Hell"" and been filmed at the same time as the other two, the story could have been more faithful to the book;4) Have Orry meet Madeline BEFORE going to West Point. This actually helped the Orry-Madeline storyline somewhat, since it gave the two lovers more time to fall in love with each other, and thus gave Orry more of a reason to be hurt by Madeline's marriage to Justin;5) Have Orry kill Justin. Another improvement on the book. In the book, Justin's death is very perfunctory and anti-climactic;6) Give Orry and Madeline a son, and give George and Constance a daughter by the name of Hope.The filmed version is generally heavier on the Orry-Madeline storyline than the book. I don't have much of a problem with that, since both the actors' performances are phenomenal and very convincing: Patrick Swayze, normally no Laurence Olivier, gives what I feel is still his best performance, and Lesley-Anne Down is very professional and convincing as a Creole belle who is, in Jakes' novels, the spiritual center-piece of the narrative. It must also be said that, as played by Down, it is hard for the viewer not to fall head-over-heels over Madeline!! The rest of the core cast is outstanding, specially James Read as George, Kirstie Alley as Virgilia, David Carradine as Justin and Terri Garber as the memorable Ashton. Also, keep an eye open for a very young Forrest Whitaker and pre-Star Trek Jonathan Frakes. The series' massive budget also allowed producers to cast legends such as Jimmy Stewart, Olivia DeHavilland, Robert Mitchum, Hal Holbrook, Lloyd Bridges, Elizabeth Taylor and Johnny Cash (!!!) as (who else?) John Brown.Book 3 of the series does not merit much discussion, though it does not marr the excellence of Books 1 and 2. It chose, belatedly, to stick to the actual Book 3, with dire consequences. It really does not belong, narratively or otherwise, to the first two series. Also, only Lesley-Anne Down and James Read signed on to do it and, good as their performances are, they were really treading very shallow waters, production-wise.All in all, notwithstanding the disappointing dearth of bonus materials (the lone making-of documentary is very interesting, albeit frustratingly brief), this moderately-priced DVD set is an essential addition to my film collection. Given the sad state of affairs, I don't think any mini-series of this quality or budget are forthcoming.Highly, highly, highly recommended.

Stereotypical characters that generated very little emotional involvement for me. There was not a single memorable scene that I can recall which generated any real emotional connection.

840245,A3BEF4IHWI0VC,B0002MFGDC,Chris Luallen,"[5, 6]","Very rarely does a show come along that I have such strong mixed feelings about as this miniseries. ""North and South"" is a tremendously ambitious effort that centers around the friendship of two West Point grads, Orry Main (from the South) and George Hazard (from the North). The story begins in the 1840's, just before the Mexican War, and concludes in the Reconstruction era following the Civil War.On the positive side, this miniseries is extremely entertaining, with a huge cast of characters and an endless series of dramatic twists and turns to the storyline. This is history served up as melodrama for a vast audience and, on this level, it largely succeeds. It depicts the Civil War era with a reasonable degree of historical accuracy and educates people that might otherwise never have much interest. For example, my wife is not nearly as interested in the study of history as I am. But she became addicted to watching these DVDs and I could hardly pry her away from the TV. We discussed what was happening as we watched together and there is no doubt she knows much more about American history than before. By the way, my wife is originally from Ecuador and is a big fan of Spanish language ""telenovellas,"" which are similar to soap operas and hugely popular throughout Latin America. I am normally not a fan of melodrama myself. But the ""North and South"" does manage to pull it off in a way that is never boring and, for the most part, alot of fun.But, with all that being said, I did have some problems with it. For one, the characters tended to be very one-dimensional. This was especially true for the villans such as Elkanah Bent and Ashton Main. But even, to some extent, for the primary characters such as George and Orry. These guys were honorable to a point that defied reality and they fought like super heroes in their numerous punch outs with the bad guys. A mark of great literature, or film, is creating complex, multi-faceted and believable individuals. This story's lack of realistic characters prevents it from reaching a higher artistic level. I also had a problem with the story's political perspective, as Jakes and his screenplay adapters try way too hard to make it seem that the North and South were equally at fault for the Civil War. I was born, raised and continue to live in the South. So, obviously, I like it here and have tremendous pride in the Southern contributions to American culture - great literature (Mark Twain, William Faulkner, Flannery O'Conner), glorious music (blues, jazz, rock n roll, country, bluegrass, zydeco), delicious food and beautiful nature. But I am also honest enough to admit that the South should feel nothing but shame for the institution of slavery that flourished here for over 200 years and brought immense suffering and misery to the Africans brought over in chains. Certainly, this program doesn't try to defend slavery. But it does try to depict the Main family as being honorable and well intentioned in trying to defend their ""way of life,"" which was plantation agriculture based on the use of slave labor. To me, this ""way of life"" was far from noble or worth defending. There is no doubt that it was the South's unwillingness to give up slavery that was the primary reason for the Civil War.Of course, the North certainly had it's faults as well and I do believe that most Northerners were  more interested in preserving the Union rather than freeing the slaves. The exception to this were a minority of anti-slavery activists known as abolitionists. They were the among the most courageous and justice seeking people of the Civil War era. But, unfortunately, the primary abolitionist character in this story is Virgilia, George's deranged sister who is obssessed with revenge and violence. Many abolitionsts were, in fact, pacifists and to have Virgilia be depicted as typical is far from the historical truth. Also the African-American characters in ""North and South"" are generally treated as a ""supporting cast,"" while all the major drama and storylines revolve around the white characters.

840273,A35YWA2V4QHOJ3,B0002MFGDC,"D. Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[2, 2]","NORTH & SOUTH is, arguably, one of the finest made-for-TV miniseries ever made.  Its scope is exceptional & it is divided into 3 sections.  Book I is about the antebellum south & the industrial north in the final decades that lead up to the civil war.  Book II details the war itself, from the firing on Fort Sumter to the surrender of the south @ Appomattox courthouse.  Book III centers around the postwar reconstruction of the ravaged south.Book IThe story begins in 1842, when a southerner named Orry Main (portrayed by the late Patrick Swayze) and a Yankee named George Hazard (James Read) become fast friends @ West Point.  While their views on slavery are different, they maintain a tight bond and serve together in battle during the war against Mexico. Most importantly, both men are likable and they're men who possess integrity & honor.The final scene of Book I is one of the most powerful scenes I've ever viewed.  Orry travels south from Pennsylvania to serve with the confederacy, leaving his friend George behind.  His journey is symbolic as well as literal.The cast of the production is impeccable, and it was my 1st introduction to a young Patrick Swayze.  I still recall my initial reaction to him back in the mid-80s:  ""Wow, a guy who looks like he just stepped out of the pages of GQ who has charisma & bona-fide acting skills!""  In watching N & S via the box set, it didn't take me long to recall to mind why I had a huge crush on Genie Francis way-back-when.  She epitomizes the sweet southern belle.  It appears Jonathan Frakes & I share the same taste in women as he ended up marrying her after meeting her on the set of N & S!The soundtrack, courtesy of Bill Conti, is top notch & memorable.  The wardrobe is elaborate & elegant, as it should be for a story such as this.  The actresses get to show off the ostentatious dresses that American women wore in the 19th century.  Obviously pragmatism wasn't on the minds of women back then!Book IIThe second book covers the civil war itself.  Remarkably, the Hazard & Main families remain woven together even in the midst of the war.  Aside from the thrust of the story, we observe unfortunate issues which plague this country in conflicts as recent as the wars in Afghanistan & Iraq:  soldiers who suffer from post traumatic stress syndrome, the horrific wounds suffered in battle, conterfeit parts being sent to the war machine, and good old-fashioned war profiteering.  No matter how much the technology & mechanisms of war change, these things always tend to stay the same.On the upside, it is heartwarming to see how Orry & George both married women who mirror each other.  Their wives are both kind hearted, beautiful and good Samaritan types.  They are similar in spirit just as Orry & George are similar in how they're both men of noble character.Book IIIUnfortunately, I found Book III to be rather half-baked.  For starters, it disinters some holes in the plot as opposed to being a continuation of Book II.  Also, there were some cast changes between Book I & Book II and they were seamless.  In fact, plugging in Parker Stevenson as Billy Hazard was a genuine upgrade!  As for the cast changes in Book III, these were (in my opinion) a significant downgrade.Most importantly, the storyline of Book III meanders a bit & paints with too wide a brush.  In fact, one could call Book III ""East & West"" as it delves into postwar issues such as pioneers / western expansion and the Indian wars.  To be sure, these were pivotal topics in this country's history, but it's for that reason that they deserve to have their own movies & books made/written about them.Nevertheless, the aspects of Part III which did detail the south were on the $$.  Part III portrayed how white southerners tried to keep black people in bondage (even though they were no longer slaves) as well as the latter's attempts to break out of lives of servitude.  It also focuses on the rise of the abysmal intolerant cult known as the Ku Klux Klan.All in all, this box set is a can't miss for civil war enthusiasts.  For persons who have even a passing curiosity about the history of this country, N & S is highly recommended.  The war-between-the-states was the single darkest chapter in the history of the United States.  It was also perhaps the single most important chapter;  its effects are still being felt to the present day.",5,"North vs South, friend vs friend",1373155200,"07 7, 2013",2013,4376,"['NORTH', 'SOUTH', 'arguably', 'one', 'finest', 'made-for-TV', 'miniseries', 'ever', 'made', 'scope', 'exceptional', 'divided', '3', 'sections', 'Book', 'antebellum', 'south', 'industrial', 'north', 'final', 'decades', 'lead', 'up', 'civil', 'war', 'Book', 'II', 'details', 'war', 'firing', 'Fort', 'Sumter', 'surrender', 'south', '@', 'Appomattox', 'courthouse', 'Book', 'III', 'centers', 'postwar', 'reconstruction', 'ravaged', 'south.Book', 'IThe', 'story', '1842', 'when', 'southerner', 'named', 'Orry', 'Main', 'portrayed', 'late', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'Yankee', 'named', 'George', 'Hazard', 'James', 'Read', 'become', 'fast', 'friends', '@', 'West', 'Point', 'views', 'slavery', 'are', 'different', 'maintain', 'tight', 'bond', 'serve', 'together', 'battle', 'war', 'Mexico', 'Most', 'importantly', 'men', 'are', 'likable', ""'re"", 'men', 'who', 'possess', 'integrity', 'honor.The', 'final', 'scene', 'Book', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'scenes', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'viewed', 'Orry', 'south', 'Pennsylvania', 'serve', 'confederacy', 'leaving', 'friend', 'George', 'journey', 'symbolic', 'as', 'well', 'literal.The', 'cast', 'production', 'impeccable', 'was', '1st', 'introduction', 'young', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'still', 'recall', 'initial', 'reaction', 'back', 'mid-80s', 'Wow', 'guy', 'who', 'just', 'stepped', 'pages', 'GQ', 'who', 'charisma', 'bona-fide', 'acting', 'skills', 'watching', 'N', 'S', 'box', 'set', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'recall', 'mind', 'why', 'had', 'huge', 'crush', 'Genie', 'Francis', 'way-back-when', 'sweet', 'southern', 'belle', 'Jonathan', 'Frakes', 'share', 'same', 'taste', 'women', 'ended', 'up', 'marrying', 'meeting', 'set', 'N', 'S', 'soundtrack', 'courtesy', 'Bill', 'Conti', 'top', 'notch', 'memorable', 'wardrobe', 'elaborate', 'elegant', 'should', 'be', 'story', 'such', 'actresses', 'get', 'show', 'off', 'ostentatious', 'dresses', 'American', 'women', 'wore', '19th', 'century', 'Obviously', 'pragmatism', 'was', ""n't"", 'minds', 'women', 'back', 'then', 'Book', 'IIThe', 'second', 'book', 'civil', 'war', 'Remarkably', 'Hazard', 'Main', 'families', 'remain', 'woven', 'together', 'even', 'midst', 'war', 'Aside', 'thrust', 'story', 'observe', 'unfortunate', 'issues', 'plague', 'country', 'conflicts', 'as', 'recent', 'wars', 'Afghanistan', 'Iraq', 'soldiers', 'who', 'suffer', 'post', 'traumatic', 'stress', 'syndrome', 'horrific', 'suffered', 'battle', 'conterfeit', 'parts', 'being', 'sent', 'war', 'machine', 'good', 'old-fashioned', 'war', 'profiteering', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'technology', 'mechanisms', 'war', 'change', 'things', 'always', 'tend', 'stay', 'same.On', 'upside', 'heartwarming', 'see', 'how', 'Orry', 'George', 'married', 'women', 'who', 'mirror', 'other', 'wives', 'are', 'kind', 'hearted', 'beautiful', 'good', 'Samaritan', 'types', 'are', 'similar', 'spirit', 'just', 'Orry', 'George', 'are', 'similar', 'how', ""'re"", 'men', 'noble', 'character.Book', 'IIIUnfortunately', 'found', 'Book', 'III', 'be', 'rather', 'half-baked', 'starters', 'holes', 'plot', 'opposed', 'being', 'continuation', 'Book', 'II', 'Also', 'were', 'cast', 'changes', 'Book', 'Book', 'II', 'were', 'seamless', 'fact', 'plugging', 'Parker', 'Stevenson', 'Billy', 'Hazard', 'was', 'genuine', 'upgrade', 'cast', 'changes', 'Book', 'III', 'were', 'opinion', 'significant', 'downgrade.Most', 'importantly', 'storyline', 'Book', 'III', 'bit', 'paints', 'too', 'wide', 'brush', 'fact', 'one', 'could', 'call', 'Book', 'III', 'East', 'West', 'postwar', 'issues', 'such', 'pioneers', '/', 'western', 'expansion', 'Indian', 'wars', 'be', 'sure', 'were', 'pivotal', 'topics', 'country', 'history', 'reason', 'deserve', 'have', 'own', 'movies', 'books', 'made/written', 'them.Nevertheless', 'aspects', 'Part', 'III', 'did', 'detail', 'south', 'were', 'Part', 'III', 'portrayed', 'how', 'white', 'southerners', 'tried', 'keep', 'black', 'people', 'bondage', 'even', 'were', 'no', 'longer', 'slaves', 'as', 'well', 'latter', 'attempts', 'break', 'lives', 'servitude', 'also', 'rise', 'abysmal', 'intolerant', 'cult', 'known', 'Ku', 'Klux', 'Klan.All', 'box', 'set', 'ca', ""n't"", 'miss', 'civil', 'war', 'enthusiasts', 'persons', 'who', 'have', 'even', 'passing', 'curiosity', 'history', 'country', 'N', 'S', 'highly', 'recommended', 'war-between-the-states', 'was', 'single', 'darkest', 'chapter', 'history', 'United', 'States', 'was', 'also', 'perhaps', 'single', 'most', 'important', 'chapter', 'effects', 'are', 'still', 'being', 'felt', 'present', 'day']",N/A

From what I can gather, the 2004 set was double-sided and was comprised of 5 disks.  The 2011 set has 8 disks and is single-sided. However, and somewhat humorously, the single-sided disks still say there are episodes ""located on other side of disc"" on the Menu. There is no video on the opposite side; only printing. Episodes 1&2 are on one disk; 3&4 on the 2nd disk and so on. The 2011 set is listed at 1,392 minutes. The 2004 set is listed at 1,212 minutes. Warner wisely chose to put the series on 8 disks instead of 5.I have not watched the entire series yet on DVD, but did see it when originally on in the mid 1980s.  The presentation on DVD is top-notch in quality so far.  The series itself was, of course, fantastic.

The protagonists in the miniseries embody friendship, courage, loyalty, honor, and strength.  It also takes a realistic view of the two sections of the country.  It does not take a ""North good, South bad"" point of view.  Throughout, it shows that there were good people as well as scoundrels on both sides of the Mason-Dixon line--to name one example, there were people ambivalent about slavery in the South, and there were greedy war profiteers in the North.Book Three was televised years after the first two (in 1994, while the first two were shown in the mid-'80s) and did not even come close to living up to the standards of Books I and II.

You might think that with a title like North and South that this series is totally about the American Civil War. But this is not so. This ENTIRE SERIES concerns the black man in America from antebellum (prewar) times through the war and on to the late nineteenth century; and this is how the three books are broken down. The second book (DVDs 4-6) do concern the actual war, but the actual war takes up less than twenty percent of the total. Given that, the battle scenes with hundreds of reenactors are spectacular and give us a real taste of what those battles and the thousands of men who died in them on both sides was like. The overall series concerns the black man as a slave in America and the three periods through which he went. These Civil War series always have to do with a Northern family and a Southern family and what they went through. If you want a more comprehensive view of the Civil War, I suggest The Blue and the Gray(long version), although not as long as this series, it is superior. My low rating is due to two problems with this unbalanced series: First the concentration upon the black man's plight to the point of nauseum in taking up a full fifty percent of the footage, while basically ignoring the more important aspects of this historical time. Second, the writers/producers making this a Peyton Place-like serial of evil intrigues; with psychotic, selfish, dominant and controlling women(it was made in the '80s) destroying entire families and infrastructures. In this aspect the series is EXTREMELY repetitive and boring. Although women may like this gossipy, back-biting, feminist viewpoint; men will be sorely disappointed! I have not read the books, but must cite them as the initial problem; as the writers would not have come up with this pathetic unbalanced screenplay. Men may find the battle scenes informative if they have studied the war at all, as it is a whole different thing seeing it reenacted than reading about it or seeing pictures. I give kudos to the battle reenactors rather than the author, the screenplay or the other actors.

The video quality far surpasses any of the prerecorded vhs versions that had been released. My only compaint is the sound is low. I dont expect surroundsound, but the volume needs to be turned up quite high.In Books 1 and 2 you are treated to a indepth view of the wealth of the south, the slavery issue from both sides.And the war while not graphic in a blood and guts sense, is none the less disturbing.Jakes created some compelling and well rounded characters. Orry(Patrick Swayze) and George (James Read) become friends and stay friends throughout hardships and war.You can feel the pain of Orry's longing for the beautiful Madeline, the torment by Bent, the fondness he has for George.TV today seems created for voyeurs but back in the 80's we saw some wonderful programming and North And South Books 1 and 2 were the cream of that crop.I wouldnt bother with Book 3 which is also included. A pale, weak storyline. None of the granduer that was evident in the first 2 stories.It was not part of the original series but done 5 years later. The remaining characters who appear seem washed out and boring in comparison.  Madleine and Ashton seem to have subscribed to the heroin-chic fad during that 5 years.And they introduce another Main (Orry's brother?) played by Robert Wagner  who was not even mentioned in the first 2 books.Plus the character of Charles who went through hell in the war and aged considerably, is now played by a guy who looks about 16 ,Kyle Chandler.However on that 3rd disc is a making Of special program where the main  stars duscuss the series.

840317,A28YVF72KWOJ1X,B0002MFGDC,KENNY NG,"[7, 12]","Whereas the film ""Gettysburg"" focuses on the military aspects of the American Civil War period, ""North and South"" focuses on the political and cultural context that existed prior to Fort Sumter and continued on after Appomattox.  There are violent battle and skirmish scenes involving re-enactors, but it is the characters' words and emotions that really fire up the screen:  ""We are good friends...If we want to keep that friendship, there are certain things we can never say to each other...certain things we can never talk about.""  As an epic soap opera, ""North and South"" has way more violence, sex, politics and cruelty that one might expect.  My favourite segment is the last two episodes of Book One where one sees the political tension and hatred that pushed the country into war: each side singing its own patriotic anthem and wanting to hang ""Yankees"", ""Slavers"", ""Traitors"", etc.  Book Two is the ""action packed"" segment but shows nothing that we have not already seen from Ted Turner's Civil War movies.  Book Three is a huge disappointment in that the ""North and South"" theme that runs throughout Books One and Two is replaced by a Klu Klux Klan story where the defeated and angry South seems to be fighting itself.  The parallel story about the US-Indian Wars is pointless and diverts from the ""North and South"" theme of ""brother vs brother"".  Yet, ""North and South"" is still way better than ""Gods and Generals"" in explaining the motives of the Civil War.  Whereas ""Gods and Generals"" appears too pro-South in its coyish treatment of the slavery issue, ""North and South"" strikes me as too pro-North in depicting the majority of the Southern characters as hot-heads, brawlers, bullies, wife-beaters, sadists, hatemongers and murderers.  The few Northern villains that exist are lame and are merely satisfying the very human appetite for wealth and sex.  The most violent Northern character is simply a misguided radical Abolitionist and Feminist who belongs in the 20th Century.  After watching the many repeated gun slayings that occur in the Mont Royal plantation, I get the impression that South Carolina is a very lawless place where people can kill without legal consequence.  (Whereas murders occuring in the North are quickly responded to by local authorities.) Am I suppose to be watching the ""Wild West"" or the ""Old South""???  In short, ""North and South"" is an extended ""Gone with the Wind"" with a lot of shotguns, pistols and vigilante justice.",3,The definitive (and the most violent) Civil War period drama,1097625600,"10 13, 2004",2004,2467,"['film', 'Gettysburg', 'military', 'aspects', 'American', 'Civil', 'War', 'period', 'North', 'South', 'political', 'cultural', 'context', 'existed', 'prior', 'Fort', 'Sumter', 'continued', 'Appomattox', 'are', 'violent', 'battle', 'skirmish', 'scenes', 'involving', 're-enactors', 'characters', 'words', 'emotions', 'really', 'up', 'screen', 'are', 'good', 'friends', 'want', 'keep', 'friendship', 'are', 'certain', 'things', 'can', 'never', 'say', 'other', 'certain', 'things', 'can', 'never', 'talk', 'epic', 'soap', 'opera', 'North', 'South', 'way', 'more', 'violence', 'sex', 'politics', 'cruelty', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'My', 'favourite', 'segment', 'last', 'two', 'episodes', 'Book', 'One', 'where', 'one', 'political', 'tension', 'hatred', 'pushed', 'country', 'war', 'side', 'singing', 'own', 'patriotic', 'anthem', 'wanting', 'hang', 'Yankees', 'Slavers', 'Traitors', 'etc', 'Book', 'Two', 'action', 'packed', 'segment', 'nothing', 'have', 'not', 'already', 'seen', 'Ted', 'Turner', 'Civil', 'War', 'movies', 'Book', 'Three', 'huge', 'disappointment', 'North', 'South', 'theme', 'Books', 'One', 'Two', 'replaced', 'Klu', 'Klux', 'Klan', 'story', 'where', 'defeated', 'angry', 'South', 'be', 'fighting', 'parallel', 'story', 'US-Indian', 'Wars', 'pointless', 'diverts', 'North', 'South', 'theme', 'brother', 'vs', 'brother', 'North', 'South', 'still', 'way', 'better', 'Gods', 'Generals', 'explaining', 'motives', 'Civil', 'War', 'Whereas', 'Gods', 'Generals', 'too', 'pro-South', 'coyish', 'treatment', 'slavery', 'issue', 'North', 'South', 'too', 'pro-North', 'depicting', 'majority', 'Southern', 'characters', 'hot-heads', 'brawlers', 'bullies', 'wife-beaters', 'sadists', 'hatemongers', 'murderers', 'few', 'Northern', 'exist', 'are', 'lame', 'are', 'merely', 'satisfying', 'very', 'human', 'appetite', 'wealth', 'sex', 'most', 'violent', 'Northern', 'character', 'simply', 'misguided', 'radical', 'Abolitionist', 'Feminist', 'who', '20th', 'Century', 'watching', 'many', 'repeated', 'gun', 'slayings', 'occur', 'Mont', 'Royal', 'plantation', 'get', 'impression', 'South', 'Carolina', 'very', 'lawless', 'place', 'where', 'people', 'can', 'kill', 'legal', 'consequence', 'Whereas', 'murders', 'occuring', 'North', 'are', 'quickly', 'responded', 'local', 'authorities', 'Am', 'suppose', 'be', 'watching', 'Wild', 'West', 'Old', 'South', 'short', 'North', 'South', 'extended', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'lot', 'shotguns', 'pistols', 'vigilante', 'justice']",N/A

840319,AATS9Q7VJ4PFI,B0002MFGDC,Kevin R. Austra,"[6, 6]","Finally available on DVD, the NORTH AND SOUTH trilogy completes the saga of the Hazard and Main families.  Additionally, this set includes NORTH AND SOUTH BOOK THREE, which has not previously been available.What a great mini series.  Both North and South, Books 1 & 2, are the perfect compliment to the historical setting and diverse sentiment prior to and during the American Civil War.  The original television miniseries departs a little from John Jakes' published work, but overall the epic makes for good watching.  A great deal of the first movie was filmed almost exclusively in and around Charleston, SC.  Bill Conti's musical score, which is available on CD, fits perfectly with production.When the series first aired in Autumn 1985, I was glued to the television set and raced back from military field assignments so as not to miss an episode.  At the conclusion of the first miniseries I was overjoyed that there was a second series in production, which aired early in 1986.NORTH AND SOUTH BOOK THREE premiered in 1994.  Much to my chagrin, I missed the third installment of the mini series due to a military assignment overseas.  When the first two movies became available on VHS, I assumed the third would shortly follow.  Having read all three of the John Jakes books, I was anxious to see how the third book was treated.  The DVD set provided me with that opportunity.I still give the mini series five stars, but BOOK THREE is disappointing.  Not all of the actors returned to reprise their original roles and it was difficult to accept anyone else playing the part.  The Jakes' BOOK THREE novel focused primarily on Madeline's struggles to hold onto Mount Royal, Charles' post-war life on the Great Plains, and Bent's murderous revenge.  Much of that detail is lost in television version.  Unlike the exceptional attention to detail involved in the first two films, BOOK THREE appears thrown together.It is understandable that a screen version of a novel has to involve some compromise of the original story.  The producers of BOOK THREE take for granted that fans of the mini series (and the books) will not miss a sudden shift in the storyline.  For example, although it is described in detail in the book, the movie makes no attempt to explain Bent's survival from the explosion at the conclusion of BOOK TWO.  Also, where is Ashton's husband?  In the novel he is betrayed and murdered in New Mexico -- which explains how Ashton ends up in Sante Fe -- but in BOOK THREE he is simply not around any more and Ashton inexplicably appears out west.The DVD set also has a special feature on the making of NORTH AND SOUTH.  Most of the footage and star interviews pertain to the first two movies.After spending so much verbiage bashing BOOK THREE, let me summarize and say that the DVD set is well worth buying.  I agree with other reviewers who recommend that you imagine that BOOK THREE has nothing to do with the first two mini series.",5,A Dose of History from a Series of Great Novels,1116374400,"05 18, 2005",2005,2951,"['Finally', 'available', 'DVD', 'NORTH', 'AND', 'SOUTH', 'trilogy', 'saga', 'Hazard', 'Main', 'families', 'Additionally', 'set', 'NORTH', 'AND', 'SOUTH', 'BOOK', 'THREE', 'not', 'previously', 'been', 'available.What', 'great', 'mini', 'series', 'North', 'South', 'Books', '1', '2', 'are', 'perfect', 'compliment', 'historical', 'setting', 'diverse', 'sentiment', 'prior', 'American', 'Civil', 'War', 'original', 'television', 'miniseries', 'little', 'John', 'Jakes', 'published', 'work', 'epic', 'good', 'watching', 'great', 'deal', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'Charleston', 'SC', 'Bill', 'Conti', 'musical', 'score', 'available', 'CD', 'perfectly', 'production.When', 'series', 'first', 'aired', 'Autumn', '1985', 'was', 'glued', 'television', 'set', 'raced', 'back', 'military', 'field', 'assignments', 'so', 'not', 'miss', 'episode', 'conclusion', 'first', 'miniseries', 'was', 'overjoyed', 'was', 'second', 'series', 'production', 'aired', 'early', '1986.NORTH', 'SOUTH', 'BOOK', 'THREE', 'premiered', '1994', 'Much', 'chagrin', 'missed', 'third', 'installment', 'mini', 'series', 'due', 'military', 'assignment', 'overseas', 'When', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'became', 'available', 'VHS', 'assumed', 'third', 'would', 'shortly', 'follow', 'Having', 'read', 'three', 'John', 'Jakes', 'books', 'was', 'anxious', 'see', 'how', 'third', 'book', 'was', 'treated', 'DVD', 'set', 'provided', 'opportunity.I', 'still', 'give', 'mini', 'series', 'five', 'stars', 'BOOK', 'THREE', 'disappointing', 'Not', 'actors', 'returned', 'reprise', 'original', 'roles', 'was', 'difficult', 'accept', 'anyone', 'else', 'playing', 'part', 'Jakes', 'BOOK', 'THREE', 'novel', 'focused', 'primarily', 'Madeline', 'struggles', 'hold', 'onto', 'Mount', 'Royal', 'Charles', 'post-war', 'life', 'Great', 'Plains', 'Bent', 'murderous', 'revenge', 'Much', 'detail', 'lost', 'television', 'version', 'exceptional', 'attention', 'detail', 'involved', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'BOOK', 'THREE', 'thrown', 'together.It', 'understandable', 'screen', 'version', 'novel', 'involve', 'compromise', 'original', 'story', 'producers', 'BOOK', 'THREE', 'take', 'granted', 'fans', 'mini', 'series', 'books', 'will', 'not', 'miss', 'sudden', 'shift', 'storyline', 'example', 'described', 'detail', 'book', 'movie', 'attempt', 'explain', 'Bent', 'survival', 'explosion', 'conclusion', 'BOOK', 'TWO', 'Also', 'where', 'Ashton', 'husband', 'novel', 'betrayed', 'murdered', 'New', 'Mexico', 'how', 'Ashton', 'up', 'Sante', 'Fe', 'BOOK', 'THREE', 'simply', 'not', 'more', 'Ashton', 'inexplicably', 'out', 'west.The', 'DVD', 'set', 'also', 'special', 'feature', 'making', 'NORTH', 'AND', 'SOUTH', 'Most', 'footage', 'star', 'interviews', 'pertain', 'first', 'two', 'movies.After', 'spending', 'so', 'much', 'verbiage', 'bashing', 'BOOK', 'THREE', 'let', 'summarize', 'say', 'DVD', 'set', 'well', 'worth', 'buying', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'who', 'recommend', 'imagine', 'BOOK', 'THREE', 'nothing', 'do', 'first', 'two', 'mini', 'series']",N/A

I remember watching Books 1 and 2 back in 1985 and 1986. My favorite part at the beginning was listening to that lush score by Bill Conti. When I heard that theme song it made me feel all the glory and strength of America in that time period, it gets you in the mood to watch the series.This in essence is the tale of two friends-Orry Main(Patrick Swayze) and George Hazard (James Read). Orry from the South and George from the North. They are cadets at West Point and this story follows their lives and their friendship through the Civil War. It was truly an all star cast in supporting roles here, notably-Kirstie Alley in one of her best roles ever as Virgilia Hazard, George's sister that marries a slave-powerful performance!! One of my favorite character's was Charles Main (played by Lewis Smith). I also preferred Parker Stevenson in the role of Billy Hazard in Book 2.They are a lot of different storylines going on but they all thread together. It's the story of George and Orry but really also it's the story of two families-the Hazards and the Mains and how their friendship withstands their ideals and beliefs through a war that forces them to take sides.The 2 constant thorns in side throughout the film are Elkanah Bent and Ashton Main. True villians to the core.Warning: Let your journey with this film end with Books 1 and 2. Book 3 is such a let down. I kept wondering when it would end!!SPOILER: George and Madeleine get together and Bent kills George's wife AND ORRY!!!!! Forget it!! It's just awful!!Interesting note: Talk about major matchmaking on the set- Kirstie Alley met and married Parker Stevenson. Jonathan Frakes (Stanley Hazard) met Genie Francis (Brett Main) on the set and married her and are still married and James Read (George Hazard) and Wendy Kilbourne (Constance Hazard-his wife in the film) met on the set and married and are still married.

In fact, I will now pretend that ONLY books 1 and 2 were made.  Just to warn you, there are some spoilers for Book 3, so if you're actually brave enough to watch it and don't want to know some things, stop here.But just for fun, here are some book 3 complaints:1.  Visually, its horrible.  It's muddled, unfocused, and cheesy.  The budget was apparently slashed.2.  Horrible continuity and obvious errors...see the next few comments.3.  Bent appears out of nowhere and goes on a revenge spree.  Apparently, its not that hard to survive an exploding barn full of gun powder and ammunition.4.  No explanation of what happened to Billie and Brett5.  George's mother disappears...no explanation.6.  Charles' age regresses twenty years.7.  No explanation of what actually happened to Stanley and his wife.  Supposed they were going to jail and Hazzard Iron Works was going to be in trouble for war profiteering.  But it all got dropped.8.  Simi and Ezra disappear...no explanation.9.  Brother Cooper....what the?!?  Where the heck did he come from?  No mention...not one word about him...in books 1 and 2.  All of a sudden he's around, threatening Madeleine and joining the KKK.  AWFUL.10.  Aston appears in Santa Fe with no word on why or how she got there or what happened to James.11.  Charles and Orry's babies were about the same age at the end of book 2.  But in book 3, Guss is 5 and little Orry is still an infant?  uhm.....12.  At the end of book 2, George tells Orry that they'll rebuild Mt Royal.  Apparently, rebuild means ""Let's move to Richmond, leaving no one back at Mt Royal while George goes home to Lehigh Station"".  At least until Orry gets murdered in the first minute of book 3.13.  Charles says his wife was killed during the war...uhm, no.  She died in child birth.  It's the details folks....I could probably go on but I won't.  For whatever reason, Hollywood decided to try and squeeze whatever they could out of the series and ended up ruining it.  They treated it like a stand alone book with no respect for the fans and our intelligence.  Just horrible continuity, lack of details, plot holes, inconsistencies, deviations.Also, I haven't read the books.  So I don't really know how true to the books the movies were.  But the first two movies were great.  Really good stories and really well done (however cheesy or hokey they sometimes were).  If you're going to finish off the series and you've already deviated from the books, why not keep going to at least make it a good story and movie.  I mean, the Bourne series had nothing to do with the books other than the initial concept.  Do the same for N&S;'s Book 3 and keep the story in tune with everything else.  Heck, I would have preferred if Orry hadn't died.  His friendship with George was the driving theme behind the storyline for the first two Books.  Why destroy that?  Whether it was the movie writers or the author, just a horrible way to finish off what should have been an amazing Trilogy.

Orry Main and George Hazard meet at West Point Academy and become lifelong friends, although that friendship becomes sorely tried as the *slave issue* heats up between the north and south. George meets and marries the lovely Constance Flynn and Orry pines for the woman forever beyond his grasp, Madeline Fabray. Orry and George are constantly haunted by the evil presence of Elkanah Bent, bent on revenge for the wrong he feels they did him at West Point which destroyed his military career.Book Two, Love and War, continues the trials and tribulations of the Mains and Hazards during the years of the Civil War. The friendship of George and Orry is stretched beyond the limits as the country is torn asunder and the two friends realize they may have to face each other on the battlefield. Orry's wicked sister Ashton meets up with Bent and the two become lovers and partners smuggling contraband into the war torn south. They also learn the Madeline's deep dark secret and use it to their best advantage. Good sister Brett is happily married to George's brother Billy, but ends up back at Mont Royal for the duration of of war.As for Book Three, Heaven and Hell, that never should have seen the light of day?***********SPOILERS AHOY************(consider yourself warned)As this final entry in the series opens, Elkanah Bent murders Orry and is presumed dead. Madeline retreats to Mont Royal where she attempts to rebuild and make it profitable once again - with free labor - which makes the rest of the community none too happy. Ku Klux Klan anyone? Orry's brother Cooper (who was in the books but completely left off the first two in the TV series) holds the mortgage on Mont Royal and very much wants her to miss a payment so he can foreclose. Ashton is down on her luck and whoring in New Mexico (priceless), until she hooks up with a man who just might be her ticket out of Dodge and back into the lap of luxury. Charles is bitter over Augusta's death and heads west where he meets a beautiful young actress. Is she the one to heal his emotional wounds? Elkanah Bent's next act of revenge has terrible consequences that send George reeling until Madeline is sorely in need of rescuing. Sparks fly. Bent's mad plots continue as he kidnaps Charles' son...And on and on and on. The only real plus was watching the so bad you love to hate her Ashton, and LOL at her final comeuppance. Loved loved loved it.I told you it should never have been made - Bent was just too OTT and the coincidences and near misses just stretched the credulity factor one too many times - and at the end I wearied of the constant repetition of seeing his wagon riding against the sunset. My biggest gripe was not that a new actor had to play Charles, it was that he suddenly became ""Charlie"" to all and sundry. Where the h*** did that come from? He was always always always Charles in both the first two in the series and in the books (although I did decline to read the last book and have no intention of doing so).Five stars for Book One, Four for Book Two and a very generous three for Heaven and Hell. I've seen a lot of comments in some of the reviews about missing scenes. Most of the DVD's in this set have TWO SIDES and need to be flipped over to continue watching. Each DVD has an episode listing and will also note if there are additional episodes on the flip side.

Well acted by Patrick Swayze, James Read, Kirsty Alley,John Carradine, Teri Garber & Philip Casnoff as the evil Elkanah Bent, as well as cameo appearances from Johnny Cash & Wayne Newton, it's a tale of family loyalty, friendship, romance & of the war that tore both nation and families apart.

This was a great series, with enough humor, drama, and juicy affairs to keep everyone interested.  When it first aired, I was only interested in the Orrie - Madaline drama, as it was the stuff trashy books are based on.  Of course, put any trashy drama in the middle of a bigger conflict (in this case, The Civil War) and you have a recipe for a great story that wrote itself.The crux of the story is the relationship between Orrie and George, two who meet as young men at West Pointe to become lifelong friends and enemies as they will serve on the Northern and Southern sides of the Civil War.  The mini series does a fantastic job combing the historical facts with the other socio economic and cultural factors that lead to the Civil War.  It was not just about slavery, whose cause was overshadowed by zealous and inacurate history classes.  We are able to watch every character as they progress from young people just starting out in the world to the opportunities, challenges and disappointments that the Civil War would bring upon us.  And it makes you think we are still reeling from it all.The juicy subplots are wonderful that keep us coming back for more.  The Orry - Madeline saga is the crux of it all.  How can you resist this?  The handsome prince who loves the damsel in distress who is married to a terrible brute who abuses and beats her, and in Book II he even slays the dragon and rescues her from the evil fortress.  How can you resist this?  There are other characters as well who are wrapped up in their adulterous affairs, dirty business dealings, and causes to keep us panting for more.  And the villans!  Justin, the abusive master keeping the world, especially Madeline, as slaves.  Virgilia, the over zealous abolitionist whose fever drives her to madness, murder and other radical causes.  And Aston, the Southern Belle greedy for power and lust who is not above exposing dirty secrets and infidelity to get what she wants.  It's all SOOOOO HOT.The biggest complaint?  Book III.  It was so bad.  I guess they felt a need to put a period on the sentance and wrap up any if all loose ends at the end of Book II.  How about that beginning where Orrie is assasinated?!?  Patrick Swayze didn't sign on to do it, so they had a guy with his back turned to the camera?!  Oh, that was just so bad.Still, enjoy Books I and II, they are great stories and historically as acurate as you could want on this side of Masterpiece Theater.",4,Gone With The Wind's counterpart,1165363200,"12 6, 2006",2006,2578,"['history', 'major', 'pruned', 'picked', 'away', 'North', 'South', 'looking', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'found', 'little', 'was', 'great', 'series', 'enough', 'humor', 'drama', 'juicy', 'affairs', 'keep', 'everyone', 'interested', 'When', 'first', 'aired', 'was', 'only', 'interested', 'Orrie', 'Madaline', 'drama', 'was', 'stuff', 'trashy', 'books', 'are', 'based', 'course', 'put', 'trashy', 'drama', 'middle', 'bigger', 'conflict', 'case', 'Civil', 'War', 'have', 'recipe', 'great', 'story', 'wrote', 'itself.The', 'crux', 'story', 'relationship', 'Orrie', 'George', 'two', 'who', 'meet', 'young', 'men', 'West', 'Pointe', 'become', 'lifelong', 'friends', 'enemies', 'will', 'serve', 'Northern', 'Southern', 'sides', 'Civil', 'War', 'mini', 'series', 'fantastic', 'job', 'combing', 'historical', 'facts', 'other', 'socio', 'economic', 'cultural', 'factors', 'lead', 'Civil', 'War', 'was', 'not', 'just', 'slavery', 'cause', 'was', 'overshadowed', 'zealous', 'inacurate', 'history', 'classes', 'are', 'able', 'watch', 'character', 'progress', 'young', 'people', 'just', 'starting', 'out', 'world', 'opportunities', 'challenges', 'disappointments', 'Civil', 'War', 'would', 'bring', 'upon', 'think', 'are', 'still', 'reeling', 'juicy', 'subplots', 'are', 'wonderful', 'keep', 'coming', 'back', 'more', 'Orry', 'Madeline', 'saga', 'crux', 'How', 'can', 'resist', 'handsome', 'prince', 'who', 'damsel', 'distress', 'who', 'married', 'terrible', 'brute', 'who', 'Book', 'II', 'even', 'dragon', 'evil', 'fortress', 'How', 'can', 'resist', 'are', 'other', 'characters', 'well', 'who', 'are', 'wrapped', 'up', 'adulterous', 'affairs', 'dirty', 'business', 'dealings', 'keep', 'panting', 'more', 'villans', 'Justin', 'abusive', 'master', 'keeping', 'world', 'especially', 'Madeline', 'slaves', 'Virgilia', 'over', 'zealous', 'abolitionist', 'fever', 'madness', 'murder', 'other', 'radical', 'causes', 'Aston', 'Southern', 'Belle', 'greedy', 'power', 'lust', 'who', 'not', 'exposing', 'dirty', 'secrets', 'infidelity', 'get', 'what', 'SOOOOO', 'HOT.The', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'Book', 'III', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'guess', 'felt', 'need', 'put', 'period', 'sentance', 'wrap', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'end', 'Book', 'II', 'How', 'beginning', 'where', 'Orrie', 'assasinated', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'did', ""n't"", 'sign', 'do', 'had', 'guy', 'back', 'turned', 'camera', 'Oh', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'bad.Still', 'enjoy', 'Books', 'II', 'are', 'great', 'stories', 'historically', 'as', 'acurate', 'could', 'want', 'side', 'Masterpiece', 'Theater']",N/A

Personally, I hate a movie that doesn't stick to the book. I want to see how the actor becomes the character, what his/her experiences can do with the character and ultimately I want to identify a character with that actor. In North and South, that is exactly what happened. It stuck to the book and the actors brought the characters to life in all their human failings and glories.While Love and War didn't stick to the book, I understand Hollywood's attempt to make the story more  palatable. However, it did stick to the book somewhat, enough to give the characters a chance to grow and learn amidst the tumult and confusion of the war. I think Parker Stevenson made a better Billy but I think the Sam Green line of the story was totally out of bounds and Hollywood should have stuck to the original story.I don't see what all the fuss is about Book 3. It stuck to the book religiously, which I respect. I don't think the poor kid who played Charles could fill Lewis Smith's shoes, but they were tough shoes to fill.

Main and Hazard join up in the Army and prepare to fight but they each run into obstcals when they are at the point.  One Orry runs into and officer named Elkanah Bent and he is the drill instructor for the divison and then he almost kills Orry and then both go off and get rid of Bent entirly from West Point.  But during the parts they have a relationship between Madaline and Orry, Madaline being played by Lesley-Ann Down then we see the two children of each of the families go off and Billy and Charles go to the Point and then to cap all of this off we see Billy and Brett both on opposite sides of the war get married and go off to the war with each other.  Meanwhile the relationship between Orry and George goes from being best of friends to almost bitter enemies during slavery movement.  We also see before the friendship is broken off that they create a business relationship and that lasts thru the war and on to happier times.Book 2- Love and WarWe leave reality of good times and enter bad times with the war and the gravest of situations in the history of our nation.  George Hazard on the North with Ab Lincoln our president of the United States of America leading the way and Jefferson Davis leading the South each played by Hal Holbrook and Lloyd Bridges plays these two important people in our history.  We see the lead in to the war and the dramatics are awesome and we see them fighting throught the war.  We also see the dramatic turn for the best between Madaline and Orry in this episode we see Justin LaMonte played by David Carradine end up getting killed in the episode when Orry seeks Madaline out after a disturbing letter from his mother Clarrisa Main played by Jean Simmons telling him that his sister Ashton played by Terri Garber and that she told Madaline that she born of Negro blood and that she didn't want to see his mother hurt.  In the end they marry and end up having a child a boy and they name him after the father Orry.  And after as we know Lee surrenders at Appomatox Court House Orry and George meet up once again for the better and they leave the civil war behind and get ready to head back for the Mont Royal plantation.  Before they leave though they need to get Orry back to his wife Madaline and see his newly born son Orry.  They get back to see him and they will go back to Mont Royal but before they do a fire breaks out in the mansion while the Mains are eating dinner and they cannot recover the plantation and the Mains and the Hazards are saddened by the death of Orry's mother Clarrisa and they bury her on the plantation.This is where I will end my review because I do not want to spoil the end for you the rest of the story is on the 3rd and final DVD called Heaven and Hell that is where we discover the post civil war era at its finest.  The story written by John Jakes the author of all three of these great books is well written and well scripted for its time.

840353,A1M9DQDGE07Q0U,B0002MFGDC,Nix Pix,"[61, 67]","John Jakes ""North & South"" has been dubbed television's ""Gone With The Wind."" Though parallels between the two are obvious from the Rhett and Scarlett-esque romance between Orry Main (Patrick Swayze) and Madalaine Fabray-LaMotte (Lesley Anne Down) to the brazen homage of Hattie McDaniel's Mammie in Olivia Coles Maum Sally, ""North & South"" treads the fine line between fictionalized cotton fields and cavaliers and hard core history.  This is a sweeping mini-series (particularly part one) that follows the exploits of two men, southerner Orry and northerner George Hazard (James Read) during a series of consequences in which each man must endure his opposing way of life that will ultimately test and rip their friendship apart. Kirstie Alley is employed to good effect as abolitionist Virgilia Hazard. After secretly marrying outside of her race, Virgilia's downward spiral into madness is rather tragic and haunting. So too is David Carridine's performance as the despicable Justin LaMotte.The rest of the cast reads like a varitable who's who of celebrities: Gene Kelly as Sen. Charles Edwards, Elizabeth Taylor as Madam Conti, Robert Mitchum (Patrick Flynn), Hal Holbrook (playing no less that Abraham Lincoln himself), Morgan Fairchild (Burdetta Halloran), Johnny Cash (John Brown), James Stewart (Miles Colbert) and Olivia DeHavilland (Mrs. Neal).  Basically, its one heck of a good show.  Parts one and two are particularly satisfying - riding the crest of popularity and rabid public fascination audiences had with the mini-series following ""The Thorn Birds.""  But by the time part three came around there was little interest or budget allocated to the third and final chapter of this sweeping saga. Now Warner Home Video delivers a definitive box set of this TV tour de force.Warner's transfer quality is particularly pleasing, if dated. The picture exhibits a solidly rendered quality with slightly weak colors, deep blacks and nicely balanced contrast levels. Age related artifacts exist, as do digital anomalies but neither terribly distracts. The overriding image quality is decidedly smooth for a production of this vintage.

As other reviewers have pointed out, book 3 is extremely weak compared to books 1 and 2, yet it still has a story to tell and if you can withstand the stupidity of the over-all production and the rather poor plot and acting, there are some decent moments within it as well. Books 1 and 2 are true gems of classic TV entertainment. They have everything you could ever hope for. Lush and beautiful scenery and photography, great acting, a superbly written script, wonderful characters all around, mystery, intrigue, passion, romance, nasty villains, and some truly unforgettable upstanding heroes. James Read as George Hazzard represents the best kind of human being this earth has ever seen, and Patrick Swayze as George's friend Orie Maine is torn between honor to his family and to his friend George. The two men maintain a loving friendship even though one believes in slavery and the other does not. The maine's and the Hazzard's have troublesome family members on both sides, with Orie's evil sister(Terry Garber) causing great misery and destruction, and george's sister (Kirstie Alley) causing almost as much discord and destruction. The deeds of these two women cause division between the two families, but somehow the bond that George and Orie have is deep and inseperable despite all this misery. Among a fine cast, standouts include Alley who gives an amzing performance, Swayze, Read, and David Carradine as a truly evil plantation owner.

840381,A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8,B0002MFGDC,Roger J. Buffington,"[2, 2]","North and South is truly one of the great miniseries, and in fact in my opinion surpasses other great Civil War films such as ""Gone With the Wind."" Based on the John Jakes trilogy of novels, this miniseries spans the period from the 1840s and the Mexican War, through the aftermath of the American Civil War. It tells the story of two families, the Hazards of Pennsylvania, and the Mains of South Carolina. The Hazards are the owners of a great steel manufactory. The Mains are the powerful owners of a sprawling Southern rice plantation. George Hazard and Orry Main, the scions of their respective families, form a friendship while attending West Point that sees them through the Mexican War and which is tested as each takes his region's side in the Civil War.The miniseries is reasonably faithful to the novels, and where it departs, the changes are generally benign. The story is also quite faithful to history, and both North and South are portrayed with respect, although the story harshly indicts the institution of slavery, and reminds Americans of the incredible fact that this evil was a basic fact of our country for a very long time.Book one of North and South is superb. It spans the period from about 1840 through the outbreak of the Civil War. The portrayal of the Mexican War is quite good, and the story of George and Orry graduating West Point and fighting together in the Mexican War makes for a fine story. The film does very well at recreating the attitudes of Northerners and Southerners during this period--conflicting attitudes which ultimately could not be reconciled by the normal political institutions of the American republic and which instead culminated in the Civil War. The battle scenes are very good and surpass what we normally expect of a miniseries.Book Two (""Love and War"") takes place immediately following the firing upon Ft. Sumter. It is again very well done. This is one of the very best straight Civil War films. It is not without flaws. Just as in the novel, the Elkanah Bent sub-plot adds very little to this story. This is true despite the fact that the Bent sub-plot in the Book Two film bears essentially no resembence to the novel. But overall, this is a fine story. Lloyd Bridges in particular does a fine job in his portrayal of Jefferson Davis. Hal Holbrook is a wonderful Abraham Lincoln. Here again the battle scenes are very good. My only quibble is that the soldiers' uniforms are too natty and pristine. Real Civil War soldiers were never very well turned out. The combat and conditions were too tough for that, and the supply trains too inefficient.Book Three (""Heaven and Hell"") takes place after the end of the Civil War, and is so bad as to be unwatchable.  Not only is Book Three unwatchable, but it totally departs from the story as set forth in the novel. (as far as I could tell-I mean it when I say that Three is unwatchable). Book Three of Jakes' novels was far and away the weakest of the three, but it was somewhat readable. Not in the miniseries, however.North and South is imperfect, but it is still so good as to rate five stars. It really is a great story of the Civil War era. James Read and Patrick Swayze turn in great performances as George and Orry. Read was sufficiently good in this part that I am surprised that this role did not lead to greater things for him.The flaws. First of all, as in all John Jakes stories, the characters, particularly the villains, are one-dimensional at best. Virgilia Hazard, Elkanah Bent, Ashton Main--these characters are complete villains and in real life no one in their right mind would want to live on the same continent with such scoundrels. I have always thought that this caricature-like characterization is the weakest aspect of John Jakes' writing, and these flaws, unfortunately, are faithfully recreated in this miniseries.Overall this is a tremendous value that many fans of North and South have waited for for a long time. It is terrific that this is now available on Amazon Instant Video.

After some difficulties, I finally recieved my copy and I spent two whole days re-living my fascination with North and South.Book 1 and Book 2 are excellent. The coiling of lives between the Hazards and Mains is just wonderful to watch and after it's done you are left with a sad but happy feeling. As a Poli Sci major, it's easy to see the parallel's between two distinct civilizations existing in the same country.I won't give you an overview of each episode. You can read a whole bunch of other reviews for that. I am just here to say this is great purchase for you and the whole family. It's like a history lesson that adds all the fillers to make it interesting. It also has a wonderful message and can be watched again and again. I am planning on a holiday routine with my family that will include this epic mini-series. Though...be warned. Just stick with Book 1 and Book 2. Book 3 is a dismal failure. I remember when this series aired on TV that I hated it. This feeling was still prevalent when I watched it on DVD again. I just couldn't get through it. The huge departure from the first two books is too much to deal with. The writers of this series would have been better servied if they took creative license with the source material.Aside from Heaven and Hell, Book 3, take time to enjoy North and South.

They are Army officers who have fought together in the Maxican War and with the rumblings of the Civil War on the horizon attempt to maintain their friendship. The story shows the human side and the turmoil of the Civil War that sometimes pit brother against brother. I like this movie simply because it is a good story. There are some battle scenes but more than anything it shows the horrible devastation that resulted in the War and the loss of friends and family to both sides. It sometimes get a little overly dramatic but overall a worthwhile production. If your interest is American History then I also recommend ""Gettysburg"" and ""Gods & Generals""...also of interest is ""The Blue & The Grey""...and if you want to learn more about the Mexican War of 1846-1848 then see ""One Man's Hero"" starring Tom Berenger (about the ""St Patrick's Battalion"" that fought for Mexico during the war.

840398,A3VQSFORKH8B7O,B0002MFGDC,Steven Hancock,"[2, 3]","The American Civil War is considered by many to be the most dramatic time in American history. So there is no coincidence that the war has been the subject or backdrop of many books, films and television productions. Three years after the war had been dramatized for television inThe Blue and the Gray (The Complete Miniseries), producer David L. Wolper brought his acclaimed adaptation of John Jakes' acclaimed ""North & South"" book trilogy to television that told the fictional tale of two families and their struggles, set at the backdrop of the most epic and tragic time in American History.""Book One: North and South"" begins in 1842, and introduces us to Orry Main (Patrick Swayze), the son of a southern plantation family, and George Hazard (James Read), the son of a northern ironworks family, as they meet at West Point. It follows both families through the turbulent pre-war era, as two friends and their families face the grim reality that the issues of the day threaten to tear their country, and the bonds of love and friendship, apart. The series can definitely be categorized as a soap opera set within the pre-Civil War era. But the storytelling is very dramatic and well-handled, and the performances, despite some poor accents, are brilliant for the most part.""Book Two: Love and War"" begins two months after the end of Book One, as the families face the harsh realities of war. From the first major battle at First Manassas, to the final surrender at Appomattox and beyond, the Mains and the Hazards struggle to come to terms with a war that is destroying their homes, and splitting their families, over the four years of bloody conflict. This is my personal favorite of the trilogy. While the war still remains the backdrop for the most part, the events themselves are shown very vividly, with mostly accurate portrayals of the historical people and events that shaped the war from 1861-1865. The acting and storytelling are at their best, and the battle scenes are outstanding. This is definitely 80s television at its best.""Book Three: Heaven and Hell"" begins after the American Civil War, as the Mains and the Hazards attempt to put their lives and homes back together again. But an old enemy, thought dead at the end of the war, comes back and and seeks vengeance on the Mains and the Hazards, taking the lives of people they hold dear, while the rise of the Ku Klux Klan attempts to undermine the change coming to the South. While definitely the weakest of the trilogy, it is a pretty good program overall. Made eight years after the events of Book Two, the actors that returned for this one are age-appropriate this time. The weaknesses come from some slower passages, and one depressing moment too many. Also, the film introduces us to Cooper Main, Orry's brother, who was present in all three of the books, but was excised from the first two adaptations, and is suddenly thrown into the mix as if there all along. Nevertheless, the storytelling is pretty good, and the acting is great overall. While not the classic that Books One and Two are, it is still a worthwhile entry into the series, and overall decent finale to the story of the Mains and the Hazards.The five-disc DVD set presents the entire trilogy with great picture and sound, and while only one extra is included, it is a great retrospective of the series and its impact on the television scene in the 1980s. Overall, this is a brilliant recreation of the time when issues such as slavery, secession and war threatened to tear America apart, and how the bond of two families survived it all.
