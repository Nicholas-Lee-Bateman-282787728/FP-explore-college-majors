1383541,A20Q4HD6A2B8W9,B0042RJWTC,Dennis Brandt,"[29, 34]","This review is on the four individually marketed seasons, not the boxed set.I thoroughly enjoyed this series and wished it had continued on through Edward's and Mary's reigns.  (There are many films on Elizabeth's tenure as queen.)  Excellent costuming, fine performances, and close enough to historical fact to make it a good teaching tool (although not for high school given the nudity and excessive, if not historically inaccurate, use of the ""F"" word, particularly in the early episodes).  It was a cruel and despotic era, and the series well depicts it within the confines of what is, despite the series' length, a short period of time.  Jonathan Rhys-Meyers was incredibly good.  Hard to believe he was the same man who portrayed Elvis Presley.Those who criticize the series for historical inaccuracies all have valid points.  As a historian, I can tell you that the mounting of the cannon depicted during the siege of Boulogne was absurd.  Some pieces recoiled; others didn't.  They were all mounted on an uphill slope, which means that recoil from firing round one would have sent them careening back down the slope, requiring hours of struggle to remount them for - well, one more shot that would have repeated the process.  The proper procedure would have been to construct an upward slope behind the piece so it rolled back into position after firing.  I was also annoyed that, given that the aged Henry VIII's obese form is so familiar, the film makers did not gradually fatten Rhys-Meyers.  The 1970 BBC series Six Wives of Henry VIII did an effective job of growing actor Keith Michell from a lean, mean lovin' machine to a candidate for a fat farm.  On the other hand, if you want to teach a non-historian why America's founding fathers insisted their new government have no established religion, have them watch The Tudors.Of course, no serious historian would tap Hollywood and the like as a valid source.  Gods and Generals, for example, made a strong effort to be a historically accurate film but insufficient effort to be a good film.  Glory, on the other hand, presented a variety of historical errors, but it was an excellent film.  All historically-based movies make factual errors, some through ignorance, others in the interest of story-telling, and some, especially old Hollywood films, are a joke (e.g., They Died with their Boots On or Santa Fe Trail).  As long as film makers make a reasonable effort toward accuracy, I am not overly concerned.  Historical drama can generate interest in a period or event and prompt the viewer to further study, as The Tudors did for me.BUT WHY WASN'T THE SERIES RELEASED IN BLU-RAY?  We all know it's coming - with three minutes of scenes previously unseen, of course - to lure us into a second purchase.  I rented it from Netflix and will do the same when it comes to blu-ray.  Also, I could never get the closed captioning to function, which I require when actors speak softly, especially in an English accent.  Beware purchasing it if you are hearing impaired.Otherwise, bravo Showtime!",5,"Superb television, but where are the blu-ray and CC?",1295049600,"01 15, 2011",2011,3053,"['review', 'four', 'individually', 'marketed', 'seasons', 'not', 'boxed', 'set.I', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'wished', 'had', 'continued', 'Edward', 'Mary', 'reigns', 'are', 'many', 'films', 'Elizabeth', 'tenure', 'queen', 'Excellent', 'costuming', 'fine', 'performances', 'close', 'enough', 'historical', 'fact', 'make', 'good', 'teaching', 'tool', 'not', 'high', 'school', 'given', 'nudity', 'excessive', 'not', 'historically', 'inaccurate', 'use', 'F', 'word', 'particularly', 'early', 'episodes', 'was', 'cruel', 'despotic', 'era', 'series', 'well', 'confines', 'what', 'series', 'length', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys-Meyers', 'was', 'incredibly', 'good', 'Hard', 'believe', 'was', 'same', 'man', 'who', 'portrayed', 'Elvis', 'Presley.Those', 'who', 'criticize', 'series', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'have', 'valid', 'points', 'historian', 'can', 'tell', 'mounting', 'cannon', 'depicted', 'siege', 'Boulogne', 'was', 'absurd', 'pieces', 'recoiled', 'others', 'did', ""n't"", 'were', 'mounted', 'uphill', 'slope', 'recoil', 'firing', 'round', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'sent', 'careening', 'back', 'slope', 'requiring', 'hours', 'struggle', 'remount', 'well', 'one', 'more', 'shot', 'would', 'have', 'repeated', 'process', 'proper', 'procedure', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'construct', 'upward', 'slope', 'piece', 'rolled', 'back', 'position', 'firing', 'was', 'also', 'annoyed', 'given', 'aged', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'obese', 'form', 'so', 'familiar', 'film', 'makers', 'did', 'not', 'gradually', 'fatten', 'Rhys-Meyers', '1970', 'BBC', 'series', 'Six', 'Wives', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'did', 'effective', 'job', 'growing', 'actor', 'Keith', 'Michell', 'lean', 'mean', 'lovin', 'machine', 'candidate', 'fat', 'farm', 'other', 'hand', 'want', 'teach', 'non-historian', 'why', 'America', 'founding', 'fathers', 'insisted', 'new', 'government', 'have', 'established', 'religion', 'have', 'watch', 'Tudors.Of', 'course', 'serious', 'historian', 'would', 'tap', 'Hollywood', 'like', 'valid', 'source', 'Gods', 'Generals', 'example', 'made', 'strong', 'effort', 'be', 'historically', 'accurate', 'film', 'insufficient', 'effort', 'be', 'good', 'film', 'Glory', 'other', 'hand', 'presented', 'variety', 'historical', 'errors', 'was', 'excellent', 'film', 'historically-based', 'movies', 'make', 'factual', 'errors', 'ignorance', 'others', 'interest', 'story-telling', 'especially', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'are', 'joke', 'e.g.', 'Died', 'Boots', 'Santa', 'Fe', 'Trail', 'As', 'long', 'film', 'makers', 'make', 'reasonable', 'effort', 'accuracy', 'am', 'not', 'overly', 'concerned', 'Historical', 'drama', 'can', 'generate', 'interest', 'period', 'event', 'prompt', 'viewer', 'further', 'study', 'Tudors', 'did', 'me.BUT', 'WHY', 'WAS', ""N'T"", 'THE', 'SERIES', 'RELEASED', 'IN', 'BLU-RAY', 'know', 'coming', 'three', 'minutes', 'scenes', 'previously', 'unseen', 'course', 'lure', 'second', 'purchase', 'rented', 'Netflix', 'will', 'do', 'same', 'when', 'blu-ray', 'Also', 'could', 'never', 'get', 'closed', 'captioning', 'function', 'require', 'when', 'actors', 'speak', 'softly', 'especially', 'English', 'accent', 'Beware', 'purchasing', 'are', 'hearing', 'impaired.Otherwise', 'bravo', 'Showtime']",N/A

1383546,A35YWA2V4QHOJ3,B0042RJWTC,"D. Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[2, 2]","This is without question the most extraordinary cinematic epic I have ever seen and it's the most ambitious project sinceI, Claudius.  Unlike Derek Jacobi's masterpiece, which has the feel of a play, The TUDORS is a big budget production with lavish sets, a stunningly ostentatious wardrobe and  a panoramic flavor.  It details the life & times of Henry VIII along with such historical personages as Anne Boleyn, Sir Thomas More, Thomas Wyatt and a juvenile (future queen) Elizabeth.  The scope of the story is impressive.The TUDORS has everything the late middle ages was both famous & infamous for.  Among these are the last days of chivalry / jousts and the transition from fighting wars with knights to engaging the enemy with firearms and artillery.  It also gives us a taste of what it must have been like to live in the days where one had to always be concerned with the plague, gruesome executions,  flowery (and often bombastic) language, a corrupted monarch, arbitrary annexation of land, liberty and property and incessant shifting political and religious alliances.The ensemble cast is remarkable and includes such veteran actors as Max von Sydow, Peter O'Toole, Gabrielle Anwar and Sam Neill.  Jonathan Rhys-Meyers has a commanding screen presence and gives us a tiny bit of sympathy for a cruel megalomaniac  who was ultimately an unlikable character and little more than an overgrown spoiled child who becomes a neurotic lunatic.  It is said that the young Henry was quite a dashing fellow and Rhys-Meyers  is a perfect choice for his portrayal of a youthful king as he's got some Errol Flynn in him.However, the thespian who steals the show is Natalie Dormer as Anne Boleyn.  Her's is not a glamorous swimsuit model's beauty.  Instead, she has a beauty that is dark, mysterious, demure, mesmerizing, subtle and absolutely intoxicating.  In other words, she was a perfect choice to portray the French seductress!  This is the first project I've seen Dormer participate in;  I'm hoping that it propels her career to new heights so I can see much more of her.  Along with that, by far & away the most interesting part of the entire series is Henry's courtship & terse marriage to Anne Boleyn.  Not to say the rest of it is boring (by a longshot), but that story-within-a-story is at the heart of the series.For myself, this project is a not so subtle shot-across-the-bow to far Right Wing religious zealots who would like nothing more than to remove those burdensome obstacles like the separation of church & state so as to gravitate towards a theocracy.  The TUDORS is a reminder that granting religion unchallenged political power has been tried before, and the results were rather disastrous.  Even those most hardened Right Wingers will judge that torturing & burning people at the stake for frivolous ecumenical issues is unacceptable.  That is my hope at any rate.As a companion to the Tudors, I would recommendNational Geographic - The Madness of Henry the VIII.  It clarifies some of the finer details of the epic plot of The TUDORS and also offers information that precedes the era where the story picks up.  I cannot praise the vision and skill of Michael Hirsch enough for putting together this awe-inspiring drama.  The TUDORS is grandiose, noble, pompous, brutal, insightful and even downright sexy!",5,Go Medieval on someone!,1318032000,"10 8, 2011",2011,3325,"['question', 'most', 'extraordinary', 'cinematic', 'epic', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'most', 'ambitious', 'project', 'sinceI', 'Claudius', 'Derek', 'Jacobi', 'masterpiece', 'feel', 'play', 'TUDORS', 'big', 'budget', 'production', 'lavish', 'sets', 'stunningly', 'ostentatious', 'wardrobe', 'panoramic', 'flavor', 'details', 'life', 'times', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'such', 'historical', 'personages', 'Anne', 'Boleyn', 'Sir', 'Thomas', 'More', 'Thomas', 'Wyatt', 'juvenile', 'future', 'queen', 'Elizabeth', 'scope', 'story', 'impressive.The', 'TUDORS', 'everything', 'late', 'middle', 'ages', 'was', 'famous', 'infamous', 'are', 'last', 'days', 'chivalry', '/', 'jousts', 'transition', 'fighting', 'wars', 'knights', 'engaging', 'enemy', 'firearms', 'artillery', 'also', 'taste', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'live', 'days', 'where', 'one', 'had', 'always', 'be', 'concerned', 'plague', 'gruesome', 'executions', 'flowery', 'often', 'bombastic', 'language', 'corrupted', 'monarch', 'arbitrary', 'annexation', 'land', 'liberty', 'property', 'incessant', 'shifting', 'political', 'religious', 'alliances.The', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'remarkable', 'such', 'veteran', 'actors', 'Max', 'von', 'Sydow', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'Gabrielle', 'Anwar', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys-Meyers', 'commanding', 'screen', 'presence', 'tiny', 'bit', 'sympathy', 'cruel', 'megalomaniac', 'who', 'was', 'ultimately', 'unlikable', 'character', 'little', 'more', 'overgrown', 'spoiled', 'child', 'who', 'neurotic', 'lunatic', 'said', 'young', 'Henry', 'was', 'quite', 'dashing', 'fellow', 'Rhys-Meyers', 'perfect', 'choice', 'portrayal', 'youthful', 'king', 'got', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'him.However', 'thespian', 'who', 'show', 'Natalie', 'Dormer', 'Anne', 'Boleyn', 'not', 'glamorous', 'swimsuit', 'model', 'beauty', 'Instead', 'beauty', 'dark', 'mysterious', 'demure', 'mesmerizing', 'subtle', 'absolutely', 'intoxicating', 'other', 'words', 'was', 'perfect', 'choice', 'portray', 'French', 'seductress', 'first', 'project', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Dormer', 'participate', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'career', 'new', 'heights', 'can', 'see', 'much', 'more', 'far', 'away', 'most', 'interesting', 'part', 'entire', 'series', 'Henry', 'courtship', 'terse', 'marriage', 'Anne', 'Boleyn', 'Not', 'say', 'rest', 'boring', 'longshot', 'story-within-a-story', 'heart', 'series.For', 'project', 'not', 'so', 'subtle', 'shot-across-the-bow', 'far', 'Right', 'Wing', 'religious', 'zealots', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'nothing', 'more', 'remove', 'burdensome', 'obstacles', 'separation', 'church', 'state', 'so', 'gravitate', 'towards', 'theocracy', 'TUDORS', 'reminder', 'granting', 'religion', 'unchallenged', 'political', 'power', 'been', 'tried', 'results', 'were', 'rather', 'disastrous', 'Even', 'most', 'hardened', 'Right', 'Wingers', 'will', 'judge', 'torturing', 'burning', 'people', 'stake', 'frivolous', 'ecumenical', 'issues', 'unacceptable', 'hope', 'rate.As', 'companion', 'Tudors', 'would', 'recommendNational', 'Geographic', 'Madness', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'finer', 'details', 'epic', 'plot', 'TUDORS', 'also', 'information', 'era', 'where', 'story', 'up', 'can', 'not', 'praise', 'vision', 'skill', 'Michael', 'Hirsch', 'enough', 'putting', 'together', 'awe-inspiring', 'drama', 'TUDORS', 'grandiose', 'noble', 'pompous', 'brutal', 'insightful', 'even', 'downright', 'sexy']",N/A

1383549,A3LQDYVAAHHV2T,B0042RJWTC,FYI,"[5, 6]","These episodes are complete, containing scenes not shown on BBC America. Historical consequences continue to ripple from the hefty rocks launched by King Henry VIII, affecting the world today. The Tudor period is interesting, even without embellishment. ""The Tudors"" indulges in mixing fascinating truth with historical fiction, so you may enjoy verifying the facts after viewing. The sets and costumes are visually rich, a nice escape from contemporary sparseness.The U.K. abounds with burly redheaded men (and actors) whose visages perfectly mimic that of King Henry VIII, they're as common as the hearty meat pies they resemble. We're quite familiar with what Henry VIII actually looked like. Poor little Jonathan Rhys Myers would be lost inside King Henry VIII's armor; what woeful miscasting. And in the opening scene with Henry administering pressure to his personal needs, Showtime shlock is demanded of Meyers and inflicted on viewers. The obligatory multitude of heaving bosoms is repetitive; the fine actors and audience deserve better. In the last Season, young Myers is crudely ""aged."" This isn't the actor's fault, but the director's, whose idea of an older Henry VIII has Meyers jutting his chin like an ersatz Orson Welles, grumbling, ""You shall have no wine before it's time."" Sadly, Meyers subsequently has been plagued by excesses of alcohol. Sam Waddington, the excellent actor who portrays Edward Stafford (an ancestor of my spouse, so I'm biased), the 3rd Duke of Buckingham, would have been a much more appropriate choice, though perhaps he wouldn't have submitted to Showtime's Henry-sleazy. Waddington is from the same area once dominated by the Plantagenet House of York. Unlike the story in ""The Tudors,"" the first conflict between the 3rd Duke of Buckingham and King Henry VIII regarded Henry's seduction of the Duke's sister, Anne Stafford, a conflict not explored in the series.The tragic Anne Boleyn, mother of Queen Elizabeth I, is masterfully played by Natalie Dormer, who shines in the role. There are stories behind stories with ""The Tudors."" Unfortunately, the creators of this series weren't particularly interested in depicting accurate events. Lady Margaret Pole (poorly depicted in ""The Tudors"") was persecuted by Henry VIII, her son in-law, the 1st Barron Stafford, was the son of the executed Edward Stafford, the 3rd Duke of Buckingham (Waddington). Stafford's mother was the daughter of the 4th Earl of Northumberland. Her nephew, Henry Percy, was said to have had an unfortunate secret marriage to Anne Boleyn. Later, he was forced to marry another woman, and was present at Anne's ""trial,"" after which he collapsed; dying a few months later.  Henry's hapless fifth wife, Katherine Howard (well-played by Tazmin Merchant), was Anne's first-cousin, the niece of Anne's mother (Katherine's father and Anne's mother were siblings). Henry couldn't leave the Howards alone. The depiction of the Dowager Duchess of Norfolk, Katherine's step-grandmother, who raised her, is oddly scewed.The worse Henry VIII's chance of providing legitimate male successors became, the more he pruned branches of the Plantagenet tree with more authentic claims to the throne than himself. Countess Salisbury, Lady Margaret Pole, was a lady-in-waiting to Catherine of Aragon, and governess to Princess Mary. Margaret's family was viciously persecuted by Henry VIII because they had many direct lines to the throne. Later, her son, Cardinal Reginald Pole, was the last Catholic Archbishop of Canterbury. Her daughter, Ursula (1504-1570), married Henry Stafford, the 1st Barron Stafford. His father (played by Sam Waddington) Edward Stafford, the 3rd Duke of Buckingham, is depicted with historical inaccuracies in the first episodes of ""The Tudors."" Buckingham was the great-great grandson of Edward the III. He had royal blood through Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester, Earl of Buckingham, younger son of Edward III, and brother of John of Gaunt; his mother, Catherine Woodville, was sister to Edward IV's queen, the lovely Elizabeth Woodville. These two sisters were descended from the de Luxembourg rulers of the Holy Roman Empire, and noble Orsini and de Balzo families.Lady Salisbury (Pole) was the eldest daughter of the George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence, and the former Isabella Neville, elder daughter of Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, and Anne Beauchamp, his wife, who inherited the Earldom of Warwick. George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence, 1st Earl of Salisbury, 1st Earl of Warwick, (1449 - 1478) was the third son of Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York, and Cecily Neville. He was the brother of King Edward IV and King Richard III. His wife, Isabella, was the sister of Queen Anne, wife of King Richard III. George's mother, Cecily Neville, Duchess of York, was the daughter of Sir Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland, and Joan Beaufort, daughter of John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster, a Plantagenet, the 3rd surviving son of Edward the III, and father of Henry IV. These families were all interwoven.The arrest and brutal execution (considered grotesque even by that society's bloodthirsty standards) of Lady Margaret Pole (1473-1541) in ""The Tudors"" depicts her as cowardly. The historical record indicates her brave defiance and devout faith. For some reason, the show's writers transferred her execution onto Thomas Cromwell, perhaps to make him appear the larger martyr. Lady Salisbury was married to Sir Richard Pole (his mother, Edith St. John, was the half sister of King Henry VII's mother, Lady Margaret Beaufort). Her grandfather was Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, the ""Kingmaker,"" the wealthiest and most powerful English peer of his age, with international political connections, a main protagonist in the Wars of the Roses. The elder of his two daughters, Isabel, married George Plantagenet, Duke of Clarence (daughter, Margaret Pole). Neville's younger daughter, Queen Anne, after a short-lived marriage to King Henry VI's son Edward of Westminster (who died young), married King Edward's younger brother Richard, Duke of Gloucester, who later became King Richard III. Anne was originally betrothed to Richard; he rescued her from captivity as George's ward. George wanted her massive inheritance in addition to her sister's.The depiction of the Catholic uprising, thePilgrimage of Grace: The Rebellion That Shook Henry VIII's Throne, has a bare minimum of detail; the Percy, Neville, and even Stafford families were deeply involved. This was a conflict between relatives about religious beliefs and power, whose outcome was fundamental to England; it would define who sat on the throne, a Tudor, or a Yorkist Plantagenet. Henry VIII, for all his foibles, sat triumphant in his sphere of assumed spiritual and political authority, largely due to all the family in-fighting  dating back toThe Wars of the Roses: A Bloody Crown.",3,Historic Fiction,1341273600,"07 3, 2012",2012,6912,"['episodes', 'are', 'complete', 'containing', 'scenes', 'not', 'shown', 'BBC', 'America', 'Historical', 'consequences', 'continue',

Jeremy Northam as Sir Thomas More is excellent, but that's about it.  Every other character is badly cast and almost all characterizations really exaggerated.  Katharine of Aragon is well played, even if the actress doesn't fit the physical description.  Most of the actors and actresses don't look anything like they should, and there's no attempt to even try, with hair color, colored contacts, etc. which would have been simple enough.The casting of JRM as Henry VIII is ludicrous; they could hardly have found an actor less like Henry VIII if they worked at it deliberately.  Henry VIII was about 6 feet tall, muscular, and had reddish hair; JRM is short, dark, and has incredibly narrow shoulders.I can tolerate some historical inaccuracy, but this show is so, so rife with them, and for no purpose that I can tell in most cases.  The way they jacked up the story of Henry's sister being married off to a foreign king was senseless; the real story was way better than what they threw together, using the wrong sister, the wrong king, etc.  That part was so, so bad, I could hardly sit through it.The ridiculous sex scenes and use of the ""F"" word really push it to the edge of being unwatchable; some episodes are worse than others with the offensive content.

I'm usually one of those to cry foul the loudest when historical epics veer away from history (classic case in point, Braveheart, a great movie with some astonishingly silly scenes and characterizations) but to the producers credit they ADMIT that they are making entertainment first.From Wikipedia: As creator Hirst noted, ""Showtime commissioned me to write an entertainment, a soap opera, and not history ... And we wanted people to watch it."" He added that some changes were made for production considerations and some to avoid viewer confusion, and that ""any confusion created by the changes is outweighed by the interest the series may inspire in the period and its figures.""Hirst is correct. Not only have they created an incredibly addictive adult drama (which is not nearly as graphic as you might think), they have also created a vehicle for greater learning. During every episode I jumped to Wikipedia to read the `real story,' and I recently purchased `The Tudors: The Complete Story of England's Most Notorious Dynasty,' by GJ Meyer, a real treat.If you read enough history, you'll see that people never change; we fight, we love, we backstab and we have moments of grace. History is a soap opera. No one is stopping you from exploring the facts, and you shouldn't let anyone stop you from enjoying this marvelous show.Every facet of The Tudors is utterly professional, from casting to writing to photography (think about it; every single scene in this series that does not occur outside or near a window has to be lighted as if illuminated by candles, fireplaces or torches, and the results here are beautiful).My only complaint - I just wish the show had run a few more seasons! Think of all the upheavals to come; the short reign of Henry's son Edward VI, the uproar and tragedy concerning his named successor Lady Jane Grey, his long-suffering older sister Mary finally getting her due, and Mary's younger sister Elizabeth coming into power.Yes, there could have been more, and yes, the show could be more accurate, but when it comes to pivotal moments (displaced in time as they sometimes are) in the lives and deaths, and there are a LOT of them, of such key figures as Thomas More (Jeremy Northam), Thomas Cromwell (James Frain), Anne Boleyn (Natalie Dormer) and Catherine of Aragon (Maria Doyle Kennedy), stirring speeches, momentous acts and last words are presented in a manner close to the historical record. Not so with the death of Thomas Wolsey (Sam Neill), however, but the screwing-over of Wolsey, who arguably had good intentions despite his desires for fame and fortune, is shown pretty much as it happened.So sit back and enjoy... but keep your laptop or history books close so you can follow along and learn more.",5,"Rating the show, not the disks!",1328659200,"02 8, 2012",2012,3018,"['So', 'many', 'reviewers', 'have', 'covered', 'series', 'so', 'much', 'detail', 'positive', 'negative', 'review', 'will', 'be', 'quick', 'overview.This', 'series', 'seen', 'Showtime', 'not', 'viewed', 'potentially', 'faulty', 'disks', 'buyers', 'have', 'received', 'one', 'greatest', 'guilty', 'pleasures', ""'m"", 'usually', 'one', 'cry', 'foul', 'loudest', 'when', 'historical', 'epics', 'veer', 'away', 'history', 'classic', 'case', 'point', 'Braveheart', 'great', 'movie', 'astonishingly', 'silly', 'scenes', 'characterizations', 'producers', 'credit', 'ADMIT', 'are', 'making', 'entertainment', 'first.From', 'Wikipedia', 'creator', 'Hirst', 'noted', 'Showtime', 'commissioned', 'write', 'entertainment', 'soap', 'opera', 'not', 'history', 'wanted', 'people', 'watch', 'added', 'changes', 'were', 'made', 'production', 'considerations', 'avoid', 'viewer', 'confusion', 'confusion', 'created', 'changes', 'outweighed', 'interest', 'series', 'may', 'inspire', 'period', 'figures', 'Hirst', 'correct', 'Not', 'only', 'have', 'created', 'incredibly', 'addictive', 'adult', 'drama', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'graphic', 'might', 'think', 'have', 'also', 'created', 'vehicle', 'greater', 'learning', 'episode', 'jumped', 'Wikipedia', 'read', 'real', 'story', 'recently', 'purchased', 'Tudors', 'Complete', 'Story', 'England', 'Most', 'Notorious', 'Dynasty', 'GJ', 'Meyer', 'real', 'treat.If', 'read', 'enough', 'history', ""'ll"", 'see', 'people', 'never', 'change', 'fight', 'love', 'backstab', 'have', 'moments', 'grace', 'History', 'soap', 'opera', 'one', 'stopping', 'exploring', 'facts', 'should', ""n't"", 'let', 'anyone', 'stop', 'enjoying', 'marvelous', 'show.Every', 'facet', 'Tudors', 'utterly', 'professional', 'casting', 'writing', 'photography', 'think', 'single', 'scene', 'series', 'not', 'occur', 'window', 'be', 'lighted', 'illuminated', 'candles', 'fireplaces', 'torches', 'results', 'here', 'are', 'beautiful', 'only', 'complaint', 'just', 'wish', 'show', 'had', 'run', 'few', 'more', 'seasons', 'Think', 'upheavals', 'come', 'short', 'reign', 'Henry', 'son', 'Edward', 'VI', 'uproar', 'tragedy', 'concerning', 'named', 'successor', 'Lady', 'Jane', 'Grey', 'long-suffering', 'older', 'sister', 'Mary', 'finally', 'getting', 'due', 'Mary', 'younger', 'sister', 'Elizabeth', 'coming', 'power.Yes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'yes', 'show', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'accurate', 'when', 'pivotal', 'moments', 'displaced', 'time', 'sometimes', 'are', 'lives', 'deaths', 'are', 'LOT', 'such', 'key', 'figures', 'Thomas', 'More', 'Jeremy', 'Northam', 'Thomas', 'Cromwell', 'James', 'Frain', 'Anne', 'Boleyn', 'Natalie', 'Dormer', 'Catherine', 'Aragon', 'Maria', 'Doyle', 'Kennedy', 'stirring', 'speeches', 'momentous', 'acts', 'last', 'words', 'are', 'presented', 'manner', 'close', 'historical', 'record', 'Not', 'so', 'death', 'Thomas', 'Wolsey', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'however', 'screwing-over', 'Wolsey', 'who', 'arguably', 'had', 'good', 'intentions', 'desires', 'fame', 'fortune', 'shown', 'pretty', 'much', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'keep', 'laptop', 'history', 'books', 'close', 'can', 'follow', 'along', 'learn', 'more']",N/A
1383557,A1ZR8F86DJRVLX,B0042RJWTC,Jason Bean,"[10, 11]","The Tudors is an excellent period-drama loosely based around the reign of Henry VIII. It's got a terrific cast of actors and colorful production design that really draws you into this time of history. You can tell from the very first episode how hard the production crew worked to get every costume and every set piece down and it gives the show an air of authenticity lacking in most historical-dramas (when I say authentic I don't mean 'historically-accurate' as this show takes many liberties with history).The plots of each episode usually play off the previous episode before it with each season focusing on a particular set of events in Henry VIII's rule. We get a very linear view of events through different character's eyes including the clergy as well as the monarchy. While none of the characters are particularly likeable, least of all King Henry himself the actor's playing them are very watchable and charismatic. The political/sexual intrigue and how Henry's decisions effect everyone around him is what makes the show addictive and will have you gunning through this series.This boxed set comes in a book-format  with the discs tucked away in sleeves on each page. Usually I don't like sleeved sets like this but the cardboard is glossed over making pulling of the discs out easier and you won't get fibers covering and scratching the discs. Again I would have preferred jewel cases but with the amount of extras included on the final disc (that are actual EXTRAS not free TV episodes) I can still recommend this set.I obviously love this show and found amazon's $80 a steal for handsome sets, excellent costumes, terrific writing and attractive actors(though still no subtitles...but allows closed-captioning).

1383561,A1T4QZSEAPTA3E,B0042RJWTC,Kathy Edens,"[3, 4]","I discovered this series late. I started watching last fall on BBC America as a re-run of the Showtime series and started at the very end of season 2 when Anne Boleyn is executed. So I watched season 3 and 4, then purchased the series to go back and watch the first 2 seasons. I've been interested in British history for a long time but hadn't really looked much at the Tudor era even though I saw Elizabeth with Cate Blanchett. I really liked the Tudors, recognizing it is not totally historically accurate and despite a few minor flaws. The flaws...obviously Henry is not portrayed physically accurate. Much of the time line is erroneous and missing periods of time are not discussed. Examples: Princess Mary is portrayed as about 5 years old when she is sent away from court and the next time we see her she is a teen. I know that it took several years for Henry to marry Anne and when Elizabeth was born, but the time seemed longer than historically accurate. (Perhaps my timeline is faulty). Throughout the first season, discussions occur regarding Mary's betrothal to several potential husbands, but she is never married during the series and it is not really explained why the betrothals fell through. Due to wars, betrayals by other soverigns etc. During the first season, Henry, Brandon, Knivet and Compton are like the Four musketeers. But then the second season comes and Knivet is missing. Compton dies of the sweating sickness in season 1. But there is no mention of what happened to Knivit. We never see how Henry's leg is injured in a manner to cause him lifelong problems. It's described as ""an old injury"" but it has such an impact on him you'd think we would actually see what happened. Mary Boleyn is present in the first season but just disappears - maybe she was with Knivit - and doesn't reappear until near the end of season 2. Similarly, Thomas Tallis who is in season one is gone without acknowledgement in season 2. Perhaps he was finding his sexuality since in season one he is straight, then in a gay relationship with Compton, then straight again. There is quite a bit of sex in season one. Less so in subsequent seasons. It isn't needed, especially the scene with Wolsey and his ""wife"", but then it isn't offensive.The acting was pretty good. JRM was occasionally over the top as Henry with too much facial grimacing. Natalie Dormer portrayed Anne perfectly(as I envisioned her). Going from reluctance in being the object of Henry's affection, to loving the power she obtained as the Queen. Her facial expressions indicated absolute smugness and superiority.  Nick Dunning very good as Anne's power hungry father. And Henry Cavil....what can one say about him other than yowza. Henry and Anne together exhibited an almost animal passion or lust more than love.Season 3 brought Jane Seymour portrayed by Annabelle Wallis, assuming the role from Anita Briem. I would have been fine with Briem, but Wallis brought a softer much more gentle approach. I ended up liking her better and loved that she brought Mary and Elizabeth back into Henry's life. Anne of Cleves was a brief marriage that became a lasting friendship. Once divorced, Henry actually seemed to regret his hasty decision.Season 4 wound up the series with wives Katherine Howard and Catherine Parr. Katherine Howard was portrayed as a vapid valley girl who was only interested in dancing and new clothes....and Thomas Culpepper. Catherine Parr brought a elegant, genteel maturity to the court.Everyone agrees that there was much poetic license taken with this series, but as another reviewer said, if watching this series gets people interested in reading or viewing accurate depictions, this series is successful.

1383578,A20OMCGB73X5LV,B0042RJWTC,Moon Donkey,"[1, 13]","This review rates the following (in order):EntourageRomeCalifornicationSpartacusWeedsSex and the CityThe TudorsTrue BloodBig LoveMy wife and I have found that we enjoy these series better than watching individual movies.  I believe that we also would rank them in the same order, so this is a male/female friendly review.  As with all MoonDonkey reviews, it goes without saying that this is gospel.I've tried to do this without including spoilers.#1 Entourage (5 stars)How could anything else be #1?  Entourage follows the career of movie star Vincent Chase and his group of friends.  This is the gold standard by which all other series are measured.  Plus, Entourage has the best one-liners of any series.  Unfortunately, I cannot include them in this review due to their graphic nature.#2 Rome (5 stars)Rome follows the exploits of two Roman soldiers - Verenus (the smarts) and Pullo (the brute).  Very well done.  For a historical drama, the sets are very well designed and believable.  In Rome, the idea is that you see the Roman Empire through the eyes of two soldiers as they experience the ups and downs of life.  My wife and I enjoyed this one a lot.#3 Californication (5 stars)Frankly, I wasn't sure I wanted to watch this at first.  I pegged David Duchovny as an X-Files guy and wasn't sure what to make of him in this role.  Also, I wasn't sure what Californication was about anyway.  Well, I was pleasantly surprised.  In Californication, we follow the life and career of author Frank Moody - a chaotic and perhaps self-destructive individual who has a way with women.  Unfortunately for him, he is trying to balance the chaos of his life on one side with his teenage daughter and her mother (his love interest) on the other side.  The dude is a train-wreck and it makes for a great series.#4 Spartacus (4 stars)Spartacus is about a man who is captured and made a gladiator slave in the Roman Empire.  There is just of a bit of a drop off from the 5 star series to 4 star Spartacus.  Why?  Well, there just isn't as much of Spartacus.  Basically one season followed by a ""prequel"" season.  I believe that is because the original Spartacus actor died of cancer.  I'm not sure if there are future plans for the series or not.Also, the effects take some getting used to.  There is definitely a CGI feel to some of the scenery.  The blood effects are similar to 300.Regardless of those issues, Spartacus was highly enjoyable.  Even my wife, who was like ""what the heck"" after the first episode, came around and really enjoyed the series.  Maybe because they show sausage.  Some of the gladiator ""locker room"" scenes are like staring at a pack of Johnsonville brats.  There is a lot of blood and nudity in this one - as there should be given that this is a brutal depiction of life as a slave gladiator.#5 Weeds (3 stars)Weeds gets a golf-clap 3 star ranking.  Why?  Because the plot just doesn't make sense sometimes.  There are points in this series where you feel like it is going one way and then - boom - the plot takes a 90 degree turn towards something else.  It's not like it makes sense thought.  Rather, it feels more like a different writer came in to write a different episode or something.  It is very strange and it happens a number of times.Weeds follows the life of a suburban mom who sells pot to make money after her husband dies.  The decision to become a dealer impacts her two sons and her husband's brother - who comes to live with her.  The series starts out with sort of a realistic ""how would this play in the suburbs"" feel, but then progresses down some more eccentric paths.We have enjoyed the series, but this is not one that we were waiting at the mailbox for the next video to arrive.  It qualifies as a ""we will watch it when we get around to it"" series.#6 Sex and the City (3 stars)Sex and the City explores the lives of 4 single women and their quest for happiness and men in New York.  Why 3 stars?  This is the only series that my wife and I would disagree on the ranking.  I suspect she would give it 4 stars and I would give it two.  Frankly, it is too much of a ""chic flick"" for me... and I would guess most men feel the same way.Wait you say - what about Entourage?  Isn't that basically the same thing with a group of guys?  In a word... no.  It isn't.  For some reason, Entourage just plays better that Sex and the City.  Also, the last couple seasons of Sex and the City really fell off a cliff.  It had the distinct feeling that they were just looking to wrap it up.Also, speaking as a guy, this series became too ""cultish"" for me.  Do you know how many women started drinking cosmos because of this series?  For that matter, do you know how many ""Rabbits"" sold because of this series?  Sex and the City became sort of a female cultural event.  Guys - that really tells you everything you need to know, doesn't it?#7 The Tudors (3 stars)This is a tough one.  The Tudors is a story about the life of Henry V of England and his many wives.  It is good, but I think many people just won't get into this series.  It doesn't have the craziness of Entourage or Californication, nor the blood and guts of Rome and Spartacus.  The Tudors is more of a historical drama.  Consider The Tudors a 3 star teetering on the edge of a 2 star.  I prefer Weeds to The Tudors.  However, I think my wife would maybe rank this a bit higher.If you choose to watch this series, I strongly recommend committing to watching the first 3-4 episodes at least.  If you just watch one or two, you probably won't stick with it.I tell you what though - one of the most interesting things about The Tudors is all of the torture.  Watching The Tudors makes any modern ""torture"" techniques look laughable.  Water-boarding?  Bah, that's for sissies!  Give me the rack!#8 True Blood (2 stars)True Blood is about life in a small town after vampires have come out of the closet and try to live normal lives with humans... or at least that is what it starts out to be.Look - I'd love to rate True Blood higher, but the series just gets weirder and weirder as it goes on.  It is like the writers got bored with the standard vampire-human conflict thing so they had to take it in several other directions... and I do mean several.  Suddenly we have werewolves, witches, shape-shifters, fairies, etc, etc.  It gets to the point where you are asking yourself, really?  Really?I'd give the first season alone 4 stars, but it drops of to 3 stars and then to 2 stars after that.#9 Big Love (1 star)Big Love is about a mormon family practicing polygamy.  The story follows the life of one man and his many wives.  My wife liked this a bit more than I did, but it just didn't do it for me.  There really wasn't anything about the show that I found interesting.  I think my wife enjoyed some of the relationship drama, but she stopped watching the series and hasn't expressed an interest in continuing it.  This one was a burn-out.  I think it is because Big Love is maybe too serious - if it had a Californication element to it, I bet it would have been pretty entertaining.So there you have it my friends.  I may continue to update this list as we watch more series.  The nutshell is that HBO appears to be focusing on more high-end ""production"" type series and Showtime is focusing on lower cost dramas.UPDATE 12/2/2011 - I was advised that I accidently referred to Henry the VIII as Henry V.  Sweet!  I'm not changing it!  I published the same review numerous times so the error will serve as flypaper for intellectuals to showcase their brillance in the comments section by advising me of the error.",3,Rating several

1383586,A2DI7UGT3YX4Q9,B0042RJWTC,"NyiNya ""NyiNya""","[32, 42]","Was Henry VIII so quiet and unassuming, was his life so staid and predictable that U.S. audiences would never sit through a series based on his exploits? The people who brought us 'The Tudors' certainly thought so.  The Irish/Canadian production team took one look at Henry, his court, his wives, his wars and his battles with the Church--and his impact on world history, culture, art, literature, politics, religion, geography and music and said, ""How the heck can we make this guy's life sound interesting?""'The Tudors' plays so fast and loose with history that even someone with my minimal knowledge had to constantly point at the screen and hoot.  But hey, it's TV, so let's not nitpick. The episodes are colorful and entertaining and we are, after all, just Americans.  Why give us content when all we want is 'shiny.'The series goes off the rails from the gitgo. Here's what one might learn from Season One:  The Boleyn family was apparently unaware of the existence of printed books (which had been introduced about one hundred years earlier). It took Cromwell to explain the concept of a printing press to a mystified George B.  Princess Mary, Henry's sister is combined with Lady Mary, his eldest daughter. The producers no doubt decided anyone with the monicker ""Bloody Mary"" was the money Mary. With Henry's penchant for marrying Catherines/Katherines, Annes and Janes, they must have assumed that we'd never handle a pair of Marys and decided to spare us the additional confusion. You have to respect that kind of consideration for viewers.The series shows Wolsey committing suicide in prison after being tried and found guilty of treason. Big deal. So the man died of natural causes before the trial, but, hey nonny nonny, it's close enough for madrigals.  And at least they don't have the poor Cardinal  doing an Isadora Duncan dance routine in his his cell -- which is how little Cathy Howard spends her last, precious moments.The people and the props seem to be plucked from a generic ""Costume Drama: Days of Old When Knights Were Bold Period"" warehouse.  The anachronisms are egregious and occur in scene after scene, episode after episode.  People travel in carriages, Henry fires a flintlock musket and admires the Venus de Milo. Most of the historical OUCH moments are pretty obvious, and I'll bet a truly knowledgeable person's head would explode from recognizing the details I missed.Okay, the BBC would never perpetrate this kind of fraud upon its public, but 'The Tudors' was made for Americans, and let's face it, we have never let facts mess up our own history.  Our own beloved President Reagan said 'facts are foolish things.""  We believe them impedimentary and unnecessary if they interfere with a good story--just take a look at the 5 Star reviews for this series.  Many completely dismiss the need to present history without distortion.  Accuracy is something that interferes with the plot and adds nothing.  One even believes that until this TV show came along, poor Henry was known ""throughout history"" only as a crude barbarian who tossed chicken bones over his shoulder.  The mini-series finally pulled the curtain of obscurity aside and it is her hope that, because of The Tudors, history will no longer ignore Henry. Moreover, she believes it will alert future generations to the fact that he was a hottie. Maybe the producers of this series weren't so far off the mark when assessing their audience.If you want a mishmash of soap opera plots, lavish (if historically muddled) costumes, and overacting, if you like to pretend you are watching something culturally enlightening and educational when merely viewing a telenovela in drag, this series is made to order.  And to set the record straight, I have at least two toes in this camp, if not the whole foot, so I had to give it that second star.  Watch it for the bright colors, the passionate embraces, the whole romance novel nonsense. Just don't pretend it's anything but a Goo Goo Cluster.(I understand Michael Hirst, who created 'The Tudors,' is planning a series on Vlad the Impaler--if he can figure out a way to add some sex and violence to the story of that kindly and courtly old statesman.)",2,Should have been called The One-Dors,1299369600,"03 6, 2011",2011,4190,"['Was', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'quiet', 'unassuming', 'was', 'life', 'so', 'staid', 'predictable', 'U.S.', 'audiences', 'would', 'never', 'sit', 'series', 'based', 'exploits', 'people', 'who', 'brought', ""'The"", 'Tudors', 'certainly', 'thought', 'so', 'Irish/Canadian', 'production', 'team', 'took', 'one', 'look', 'Henry', 'court', 'wives', 'wars', 'battles', 'Church', 'impact', 'world', 'history', 'culture', 'art', 'literature', 'politics', 'religion', 'geography', 'music', 'said', 'How', 'heck', 'can', 'make', 'guy', 'life', 'sound', 'interesting', ""'The"", 'Tudors', 'plays', 'fast', 'loose', 'history', 'even', 'someone', 'minimal', 'knowledge', 'had', 'constantly', 'point', 'screen', 'hoot', 'TV', 'let', 'not', 'nitpick', 'episodes', 'are', 'colorful', 'entertaining', 'are', 'just', 'Americans', 'Why', 'give', 'content', 'when', 'want', ""'shiny"", 'series', 'rails', 'gitgo', 'Here', 'what', 'one', 'might', 'learn', 'Season', 'One', 'Boleyn', 'family', 'was', 'apparently', 'unaware', 'existence', 'printed', 'books', 'had', 'been', 'introduced', 'one', 'hundred', 'years', 'earlier', 'took', 'Cromwell', 'explain', 'concept', 'printing', 'press', 'mystified', 'George', 'B.', 'Princess', 'Mary', 'Henry', 'sister', 'combined', 'Lady', 'Mary', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'producers', 'doubt', 'decided', 'anyone', 'monicker', 'Bloody', 'Mary', 'was', 'money', 'Mary', 'Henry', 'penchant', 'marrying', 'Catherines/Katherines', 'Annes', 'Janes', 'must', 'have', 'assumed', ""'d"", 'never', 'handle', 'pair', 'Marys', 'decided', 'spare', 'additional', 'confusion', 'have', 'respect', 'kind', 'consideration', 'viewers.The', 'series', 'Wolsey', 'committing', 'suicide', 'prison', 'being', 'tried', 'found', 'guilty', 'treason', 'Big', 'deal', 'man', 'died', 'natural', 'causes', 'trial', 'hey', 'nonny', 'nonny', 'close', 'enough', 'madrigals', 'least', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'poor', 'Cardinal', 'doing', 'Isadora', 'Duncan', 'dance', 'routine', 'cell', 'how', 'little', 'Cathy', 'Howard', 'last', 'precious', 'moments.The', 'people', 'props', 'seem', 'be', 'plucked', 'generic', 'Costume', 'Drama', 'Days', 'Old', 'When', 'Knights', 'Were', 'Bold', 'Period', 'warehouse', 'anachronisms', 'are', 'egregious', 'occur', 'scene', 'scene', 'episode', 'episode', 'People', 'travel', 'carriages', 'Henry', 'flintlock', 'musket', 'Venus', 'de', 'Milo', 'Most', 'historical', 'OUCH', 'moments', 'are', 'pretty', 'obvious', ""'ll"", 'bet', 'truly', 'knowledgeable', 'person', 'head', 'would', 'explode', 'recognizing', 'details', 'missed.Okay', 'BBC', 'would', 'never', 'perpetrate', 'kind', 'fraud', 'public', 'Tudors', 'was', 'made', 'Americans', 'let', 'face', 'have', 'never', 'let', 'facts', 'mess', 'up', 'own', 'history', 'own', 'beloved', 'President', 'Reagan', 'said', ""'facts"", 'are', 'foolish', 'things', 'believe', 'impedimentary', 'unnecessary', 'interfere', 'good', 'story', 'just', 'take', 'look', '5', 'Star', 'reviews', 'series', 'Many', 'completely', 'dismiss', 'need', 'present', 'history', 'distortion', 'Accuracy', 'something', 'plot', 'nothing', 'One', 'even', 'TV', 'show', 'came', 'along', 'poor', 'Henry', 'was', 'known', 'history', 'only', 'crude', 'barbarian', 'who', 'tossed', 'chicken', 'bones', 'shoulder', 'mini-series', 'finally', 'pulled', 'curtain', 'obscurity', 'aside', 'hope', 'Tudors', 'history', 'will', 'no', 'longer', 'ignore', 'Henry', 'Moreover', 'will', 'alert', 'future', 'generations', 'fact', 'was', 'hottie', 'Maybe', 'producers', 'series', 'were', ""n't"", 'so', 'far', 'mark', 'when', 'assessing', 'audience.If', 'want', 'mishmash', 'soap', 'opera', 'plots', 'lavish', 'historically', 'muddled', 'costumes', 'overacting', 'like', 'pretend', 'are', 'watching', 'something', 'culturally', 'enlightening', 'educational', 'when', 'merely', 'viewing', 'telenovela', 'drag', 'series', 'made', 'order', 'set', 'record', 'straight', 'have', 'least', 'two', 'toes', 'camp', 'not', 'whole', 'foot', 'had', 'give', 'second', 'star', 'Watch', 'bright', 'colors', 'passionate', 'embraces', 'whole', 'romance', 'novel', 'nonsense', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'pretend', 'anything', 'Goo', 'Goo', 'Cluster', 'understand', 'Michael', 'Hirst', 'who', 'created', 'Tudors', 'planning', 'series', 'Vlad', 'Impaler', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'way', 'add', 'sex', 'violence', 'story', 'kindly', 'courtly', 'old', 'statesman']",N/A

When I receives the dvd's, most of the discs were scratched, the album packaging it came in was torn and the disc's were coming out of the slots from the bottom. It looked second hand and was just shrink wrapped to look new. I played a few disc and there were episodes that skip and freeze on certain parts. Returned it for a replacement since I payed for a new item, not some ripped up second hand stuff. I think HBO should stop marketing their products in album-like slot cardboard packaging. It scratches up the discs and it wears out the cardboard overtime from use. Will see how the replacement looks like. 2 stars for attrocious packaging and discs.Update: 2 stars to 1The replacement sent has less scratches, but still some series skips and freezes.

1383592,AB6BQXTOMO7F7,B0042RJWTC,PJS1975,"[3, 3]","I'd never watched a single episode of ""The Tudors"" before, but recently I finished viewing the series in its entirety. Leave aside the fact that the costumes and the production design make films like ""Barry Lyndon"" and ""Amadeus"" look like a high school play by comparison. Leave aside all the courtly manners and pretty speech, and the fact that this program actually contains the line: ""Seize him!"" Here's the story in a nutshell:-The Vatican says: ""You must follow God's law - that is, the law of the Catholic Church, and ONLY persecute, torture, and kill heretics as we see fit.""-England says: ""NO! We shall create our own Church, free from your superstitious tyranny, corruption and repression; and in our new, enlightened Church of England, we shall ONLY persecute, torture, and kill heretics as WE see fit, may it please you my good sir! I said GOOD DAY, sir!""I tell ya, nothing's better for executions than a religion that tells people that being sentenced to death by the king is equivalent to being sentenced to death by ""God.""Showtime's ""The Tudors,"" like HBO's ""Rome,"" front-end loads the program with sex scenes, fights and jousting, brutal executions, and intricate political plotting. Unlike ""Rome"", however, the sex scenes and fights have vanished by the time you get to the final season, and the series ends on a melancholy, wistful note, as all the characters have grown old and fretful. There is no ""final showdown"" in Season 4; however, you do finally get the satisfaction of seeing an arrest warrant for ""heresy"" get totally slammed back in some smug bishop's face after four seasons of ""Everybody who gets arrested gets executed, no second chances"", plus a few other pleasant surprises before the end.Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, an actor I'd never seen in anything before, shows impressive range in the role of Henry. For the first 3 seasons, the scenery-chewing Rhys-Meyers rampages terrifyingly, loves deeply then turns a cold shoulder to former lovers, and is seized by fits of sociopathic paranoia and stop-on-a-dime changes of mind, all the well known things that caused Henry VIII to become a byword for tyranny and unstable personality among latter-day historians. However, in the final season, Rhys Meyers is just as convincingly old and sorrowful, and even unhappy as he appears to look back over his problem-plagued reign. There's a scene in which Edward Seymour (Max Brown) , his minister, comes to Henry to tell him there was a failed coup against his cabinet, and Henry almost looks regretful that they didn't carry it out, and then he appears sincerely heartbroken because he learned the coup was being led by a longtime friend and supporter.I guess, to Henry, his entire reign, his whole life, had been the Vatican and various countries (or else his own guys) plotting against him, and almost all the women he loved ended up getting found ""guilty"" of , A, witchcraft, B, sleeping around, or, C, just plain old being barren, or they died during childbirth. Still, the program makes it hard to sympathize with a king who always seems ready to authorize his corrupt ministers to carry out all kinds of atrocities in his name.Yes, there's some stupid soap opera crap in this program, lots and lots of ""plotting against people,"" only it's not really like a soap opera because the end result of these plots is not the characters getting head-bonk induced amnesia or falling into comas or some crap, they're getting BEHEADED! One aspect of ""The Tudors"" that really deserves criticism, in my opinion, is its somewhat grating repetitiveness. Nearly everybody is plotting to get into the King's good favor, and, again and again, they do this by framing up the person who is currently in the King's good favor, conspiring to convince Henry that the plotted-against person is either, A, a failure, B, a traitor, or, C, a heretic. Someone is always trying to ""purge"" someone else's faction from court, and, yes, it does get old, kind of like a ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" movie that always begins with a certain number of teenagers, nearly all of which end up getting offed in creative ways. But I guess that's that old maxim, ""History repeats...""But the whole impression of ""The Tudors"" contains more than that. There is a lot of cool s*** here: a huge peasant revolt that threatens to engulf the entire north of the country, there's a siege of a walled city in France, there are scheming Popes, corrupt Chancellors, and crises of conscience from the commons to the King. The torture scenes are grisly and horrifying, but they stop short of going completely f***ing nuts cannibal holocaust style. But yes, you will see gory severed heads on spikes, you will see horizon-reaching fields filled with gallows that bear hundreds of ""heretics'"" hanged corpses, and, on one particular occasion, a guy gets a red-hot poker rammed up his..... Well, you get the idea. Despite all of the courtly activities, imaginative entertainments, and opulence, this gets pretty violent, but it's nothing too over-the-top.Final note: I still don't understand why the Season Three graphic depicts Henry VIII enthroned on some weird ""flesh-throne"" comprised of nude people posing, which had nothing at all to do with the story, but whatever. ""The Tudors"" is nowhere close to being that extreme in any regard, but I do think it's a worthwhile and entertaining program, especially if period pieces or late medieval history are your thing.",4,Henry VIII kills more of his own guys than Darth Vader,1296432000,"01 31, 2011",2011,5428,"[""'d"", 'never', 'watched', 'single', 'episode', 'Tudors', 'recently', 'finished', 'viewing',

He is so regal so effortlessly that he brings instant credibility to his role. I didn't mind the poetic license used in some parts of the series (even though I am an English history buff).My rating of 3 stars is because of the difficulties encountered in Series 2 and 3 with the discs.  There was some flaw in those two sets that prevented the DVD player from moving on to the last episode on the disc.  The last episode couldn't even be accessed by choosing it from the episode menu.

This is the king that had 6 wives because as he became dissatisfied with them he would get rid of them. King Henry VIII divorced the lucky ones and beheaded the unfortunate ones. The most interesting part of The Tudors is the battle that the religious reformers in England have with the Catholic Church. The reformers battle against the Catholic Church gave birth to the Protestant Movement. King Henry VIII created the Church of England because the Catholic Church would not give him a divorce. So we owe the way that many of us worship god today to a perverse king that just wanted a male heir that his first wife could not give him one.

It will have you hooked from scene 1. It is even more amazing that this show is based on factual events and actual people. Most everyone knows the infamous legacy and history of King Henry VIII and his 6 wives, but may not know how everything transpired. Well this show certainly helps to fill in some of those blanks, though I'm sure some plots were embellished and/or imagined either for shock value or just to keep viewers as interested as possible. Whatever the case, it is a great success. The true star of the series is Jonathan Rhys Meyers and he really and truly embraces the role. He is mesmerizing, handsome, arrogant, willful, and above all, very King-like in appearance and manner. He may not be a true likeness to the real King, but I don't think many people would complain. Henry Cavill plays Henry's ever faithful best friend Charles Brandon. His is also an intriguing role. I believe these 2 actors are the only ones to appear in every single episode. There is a multitude of fine actors and actresses, too many to go through but not one actor does a poor job here. It really is impressive.There are 4 seasons, and they start with Henry's first wife, Queen Catherine of Aragon to his last wife and follow his marriage through two beheadings, a tragic death of his true love, and finally his last wife, Catherine Parr who is ever loyal and faithful. Besides his personal history, the show deals with actual events that transpired, his constant struggles with France and Spain, his seperation from the Catholic Church, and we can't forget the Lutheran burnings. There is too much to go in to but it really is worth a look. The series is not perfect though. There were some aspects of it that bugged me at times. For example, certain subplots never get settled and you are left to wonder what happened. Some characters that appear to be important disappear halfway through a season and never return. Those are minor gripes and certainly don't detract from the series and I can even understand how much of an undertaking a series of this magnitude really is and with so many characters, trying to keep absolutely everything in check can get a bit tricky. Something else that impressed me is the fact that exact phrases were used in certain scenes, from Anne Boleyn's speech at her beheading, to dying Queen Catherine's letter Henry. I thought that was a great touch.I recommend this series to anyone in love with gorgeous period films, great acting, dramas, as well as history lovers. Also, there is plently of sex, violence and torture, so viewer beware if that is something you are concerned about.",5,Addictive and wonderful,1302480000,"04 11, 2011",2011,2740,"['Tudors', 'lush', 'visually', 'stunning', 'series', 'complete', 'wonderful', 'acting', 'to-die-for', 'costumes', 'award-worthy', 'script', 'will', 'have', 'hooked', 'scene', '1', 'even', 'more', 'amazing', 'show', 'based', 'factual', 'events', 'actual', 'people', 'Most', 'everyone', 'infamous', 'legacy', 'history', 'King', 'Henry', 'VIII', '6', 'wives', 'may', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'everything', 'transpired', 'Well', 'show', 'certainly', 'fill', 'blanks', ""'m"", 'sure', 'plots', 'were', 'embellished', 'and/or', 'imagined', 'either', 'shock', 'value', 'just', 'keep', 'viewers', 'as', 'interested', 'possible', 'Whatever', 'case', 'great', 'success', 'true', 'star', 'series', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', 'really', 'truly', 'role', 'mesmerizing', 'handsome', 'arrogant', 'willful', 'very', 'King-like', 'appearance', 'manner', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'true', 'likeness', 'real', 'King', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'many', 'people', 'would', 'complain', 'Henry', 'Cavill', 'Henry', 'ever', 'faithful', 'best', 'friend', 'Charles', 'Brandon', 'also', 'intriguing', 'role', 'believe', '2', 'actors', 'are', 'only', 'ones', 'appear', 'single', 'episode', 'multitude', 'fine', 'actors', 'actresses', 'too', 'many', 'go', 'not', 'one', 'actor', 'poor', 'job', 'here', 'really', 'impressive.There', 'are', '4', 'seasons', 'start', 'Henry', 'first', 'wife', 'Queen', 'Catherine', 'Aragon', 'last', 'wife', 'follow', 'marriage', 'two', 'beheadings', 'tragic', 'death', 'true', 'love', 'finally', 'last', 'wife', 'Catherine', 'Parr', 'who', 'ever', 'loyal', 'faithful', 'personal', 'history', 'show', 'actual', 'events', 'transpired', 'constant', 'struggles', 'France', 'Spain', 'seperation', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'ca', ""n't"", 'forget', 'Lutheran', 'burnings', 'too', 'much', 'go', 'really', 'look', 'series', 'not', 'perfect', 'were', 'aspects', 'bugged', 'times', 'example', 'certain', 'subplots', 'never', 'get', 'settled', 'are', 'left', 'wonder', 'what', 'happened', 'characters', 'appear', 'be', 'important', 'disappear', 'halfway', 'season', 'never', 'return', 'are', 'minor', 'gripes', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'detract', 'series', 'can', 'even', 'understand', 'how', 'much', 'undertaking', 'series', 'magnitude', 'really', 'so', 'many', 'characters', 'trying', 'keep', 'absolutely', 'everything', 'check', 'can', 'get', 'bit', 'tricky', 'Something', 'else', 'impressed', 'fact', 'exact', 'phrases', 'were', 'used', 'certain', 'scenes', 'Anne', 'Boleyn', 'speech', 'beheading', 'dying', 'Queen', 'Catherine', 'letter', 'Henry', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'touch.I', 'recommend', 'series', 'anyone', 'love', 'gorgeous', 'period', 'films', 'great', 'acting', 'dramas', 'as', 'well', 'history', 'lovers', 'Also', 'plently', 'sex', 'violence', 'torture', 'so', 'viewer', 'beware', 'something', 'are', 'concerned']",N/A
