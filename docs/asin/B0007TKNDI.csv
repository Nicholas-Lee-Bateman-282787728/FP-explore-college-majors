889672,AUSZNRZ3DVX1Q,B0007TKNDI,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","This is a very early Vietnam film based on the book 'Incident At Muc Wa'. I believe this was the first anti war film about Vietnam but I could be wrong about that. The subject is America advisors in south Vietnam 'conflict' prior to the major commitment of US armed forces. Burt Lancaster stars above the line but this is really Craig Wasson's film. Craig Wasson is a 'draftee' who has volunteered to be part of the advisory team. I find that a little stretch of the imagination ... but none the less. Burt Lancaster makes the mistake of not scouting Muc wa and then reporting Muc Wa as being of no interest. Army 'intelligence' finds that Muc Wa is probably a hot spot. This 'intelligence' demonstrates the start of the Vietnam wars insanity. Which as, a professional soldier, is where Burt Lancaster comes in. It turns out Muc Wa is a place the French defended and were defeated at. Wasson goes out with a mixed advisor/Vietnamese team to fortify the hamlet. Wasson's developing relationship with his Vietnamese counter parts is the major focus of the story.

I do, however, hope that any portrayal of the war treat the men who fought there  fairly and honorably.  On this count ""Go Tell the Spartans"" does so.  The setting of the film is in the rural outskirts of South Vietnam where a few American advisors are posted with a few ARVN regulars under their command.  Their assignment is to protect a seemingly insignificant village outpost.  It wouldn't seem that this would be a target of Vietcong activity but little in this war made sense conventionally.  What the makers of this film are trying to convey is that this skirmish is a microcosm of the larger battle that was to come.  They wait until the end of the picture to announce to powerful effect that it is 1964, the year prior to the escalation of the war.  The battle of Muc Wa is a small piece of a big puzzle but it is a harbinger of the ominous things to come.  Burt Lancaster is effectively worldweary as Major Barker, a man who fought honorably in two prior conflicts but has the foresight to see his current assignment as a sucker's deal.  The largely unknown cast, both American and Asian, are effectively utilized here.  Standouts are Craig Wasson as a soldier who idealistically volunteers for Vietnam only to have his illusions shattered and Jonathan Goldsmith as a sergeant whose been in Vietnam too long.

889682,AQSQLWD3NLMAS,B0007TKNDI,Glenn A. Buttkus,"[12, 14]","Based on the fine novel INCIDENT AT MUC WA by Daniel Ford, here is a gem of a war movie; full of insights, barbs, politics, exciting battle scenes, and caustic wit. Burt Lancaster played Maj. Asa Barker, a 30 year career officer, long ago adjusted to being assigned to ""garbage details""--after a disastrous incident, a youthful and macho escapade, left him vulnerable and in need of being ""punished"" for the rest of his career. His terrific one-liners and anti-hero weariness initially created a kind of M.A.S.H. environment, whereby it seemed that all the foul-up in the U.S. Army was sent to his outfit. But in no time the film shifts its serio-comic aspects into a grim primer about the price of arrogance and ignorance strutting around in some else's country.A young Marc Singer, fresh from his theatrical triumph as Petrucio at ACT San Francisco, played Capt. Olivetti -a very brash second-in-command who felt that ""a little combat"" put him on the fast track for career advancements. The delicious scene between him and Lancaster, as Maj. Barker explained why ""after 30 years and a bucket of medals"" he was still a major is priceless; a real high point to be added to Lancaster's lexicon of great scenes in great films.Craig Wasson played Cpl.Courcey, a draftee who ""volunteered for combat"", who felt the need to reach out to the people, the villagers, until he was disastrously betrayed by his own naivet&eacute; -having to accept the fact that no one was trustworthy, not women or children. Jonathan Goldsmith, a very good actor who spent most of his career doing television roles, shined as Sgt. Oleonowski. For a time, his take-charge non-com saved everyone's bacon, until the terrible ghosts of his past and PTSD caught up with him and pulverized him emotionally first into lethargy and then into suicide. Goldsmith's character stole every scene he was in. We wanted to see more of this sergeant, and to let this character have more focus; like a shining story within a story. In just a few brief scenes it was obvious that his back story was very clear to this actor.Dolph Sweet was Gen. Harnitz, who was determined that by God no Americans would ever face the humiliating defeats that the French had experienced. We watch as America's great mistakes in Southeast Asia were planted as seeds of hubris, underestimating the enemy, and attempting to fight a conventional war against guerillas -against an indigent population who had fought all their lives, first against the Japanese, then the Chinese, the French, and now the ugly Americans.The movie was directed by Ted Post, a veteran TV director from the golden age of television who did not graduate to feature films until the 60's; but he never had the verve or style of say a Robert Altman, John Frankenheimer, or Sydney Pollack. His directing on GO TELL THE SPARTANS (1978) was a bit lackluster at best. Some of his earlier efforts included HANG `EM HIGH (1968), BENEATH THE PLANET OF THE APES (1970), and MAGNUM FORCE (1973). He did have a good but uninspired cinematographer, Harry Stradling Jr., and with a modest budget, a brilliant script, and a powerhouse cast, Ted Post gave use a very good military film that paved the way for other anti-war films to follow it. One of my favorites was HBO's A BRIGHT SHINING LIE (1998) with Bill Paxton.",4,Death of Illusion,1187568000,"08 20, 2007",2007,3311,"['Based', 'fine', 'novel', 'INCIDENT', 'AT', 'MUC', 'WA', 'Daniel', 'Ford', 'here', 'gem', 'war', 'movie', 'full', 'insights', 'barbs', 'politics', 'exciting', 'battle', 'scenes', 'caustic', 'wit', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'played', 'Maj.', 'Asa', 'Barker', '30', 'year', 'career', 'officer', 'long', 'ago', 'adjusted', 'being', 'assigned', 'garbage', 'details', 'disastrous', 'incident', 'youthful', 'macho', 'escapade', 'left', 'vulnerable', 'need', 'being', 'punished', 'rest', 'career', 'terrific', 'one-liners', 'anti-hero', 'weariness', 'initially', 'created', 'kind', 'M.A.S.H', 'environment', 'whereby', 'seemed', 'foul-up', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'was', 'sent', 'outfit', 'time', 'film', 'shifts', 'serio-comic', 'aspects', 'grim', 'primer', 'price', 'arrogance', 'ignorance', 'strutting', 'around', 'else', 'country.A', 'young', 'Marc', 'Singer', 'fresh', 'theatrical', 'triumph', 'Petrucio', 'ACT', 'San', 'Francisco', 'played', 'Capt', 'Olivetti', '-a', 'very', 'brash', 'second-in-command', 'who', 'felt', 'little', 'combat', 'put', 'fast', 'track', 'career', 'advancements', 'delicious', 'scene', 'Lancaster', 'Maj.', 'Barker', 'explained', 'why', '30', 'years', 'bucket', 'medals', 'was', 'still', 'major', 'priceless', 'real', 'high', 'point', 'be', 'added', 'Lancaster', 'lexicon', 'great', 'scenes', 'great', 'films.Craig', 'Wasson', 'played', 'Cpl.Courcey', 'draftee', 'who', 'volunteered', 'combat', 'who', 'felt', 'need', 'reach', 'out', 'people', 'villagers', 'was', 'disastrously', 'betrayed', 'own', 'naivet', 'eacute', '-having', 'accept', 'fact', 'one', 'was', 'trustworthy', 'not', 'women', 'children', 'Jonathan', 'Goldsmith', 'very', 'good', 'actor', 'who', 'spent', 'most', 'career', 'doing', 'television', 'roles', 'shined', 'Sgt', 'Oleonowski', 'time', 'take-charge', 'non-com', 'saved', 'everyone', 'bacon', 'terrible', 'ghosts', 'past', 'PTSD', 'caught', 'up', 'pulverized', 'emotionally', 'first', 'lethargy', 'then', 'suicide', 'Goldsmith', 'character', 'stole', 'scene', 'was', 'wanted', 'see', 'more', 'sergeant', 'let', 'character', 'have', 'more', 'focus', 'shining', 'story', 'story', 'just', 'few', 'brief', 'scenes', 'was', 'obvious', 'back', 'story', 'was', 'very', 'clear', 'actor.Dolph', 'Sweet', 'was', 'Gen.', 'Harnitz', 'who', 'was', 'determined', 'God', 'Americans', 'would', 'ever', 'face', 'humiliating', 'French', 'had', 'experienced', 'watch', 'America', 'great', 'mistakes', 'Southeast', 'Asia', 'were', 'planted', 'seeds', 'hubris', 'underestimating', 'enemy', 'attempting', 'fight', 'conventional', 'war', 'guerillas', 'indigent', 'population', 'who', 'had', 'fought', 'lives', 'first', 'Japanese', 'then', 'Chinese', 'French', 'now', 'ugly', 'Americans.The', 'movie', 'was', 'directed', 'Ted', 'Post', 'veteran', 'TV', 'director', 'golden', 'age', 'television', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'graduate', 'feature', 'films', '60', 'never', 'had', 'verve', 'style', 'say', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'John', 'Frankenheimer', 'Sydney', 'Pollack', 'directing', 'GO', 'TELL', 'THE', 'SPARTANS', '1978', 'was', 'bit', 'lackluster', 'best', 'earlier', 'efforts', 'included', 'HANG', 'EM', 'HIGH', '1968', 'BENEATH', 'THE', 'PLANET', 'THE', 'APES', '1970', 'MAGNUM', 'FORCE', '1973', 'did', 'have', 'good', 'uninspired', 'cinematographer', 'Harry', 'Stradling', 'Jr.', 'modest', 'budget', 'brilliant', 'script', 'powerhouse', 'cast', 'Ted', 'Post', 'gave', 'use', 'very', 'good', 'military', 'film', 'paved', 'way', 'other', 'anti-war', 'films', 'follow', 'One', 'favorites', 'was', 'HBO', 'A', 'BRIGHT', 'SHINING', 'LIE', '1998', 'Bill', 'Paxton']",N/A

Instead of having as its primary purpose the making of a political statement, it merely tells a story from the early days of the war.Burt Lancaster plays an officer assigned to command a remote hamlet in Vietnam. He is a competent officer who values the lives of his men and those he is there to train and protect. He does not suffer fools gladly. When he gets an assignment to check out a remote village, he sends some of his men to do so. He is told that the location is a strategically important one. His force comes under more fire than expected and gets into trouble. Lancaster must wheel and deal with the political types in order to get the support he needs for his men. Eventually, though, he is told that the place is no longer important and to withdraw his men. He is to leave the natives behind to the mercies of the Viet Cong. This does not sit well with him or an idealistic corporal under his command. He evacuates the Americans as ordered but then stays behind with the native troops to try and help them out.The title comes from a famous Greek inscription of the Spartans. They were ordered to hold a pass. They did so to the last man. The inscription reads, ""Go tell the Spartans that here, obedient to there orders, Leonidas and his 600 died."" That is the gist, not the actual message.

889687,AGGP8FKBFDHL1,B0007TKNDI,Jonathan Weller,"[2, 2]","""Go Tell the Spartans"" is a 1978 movie based on Daniel Ford's 1967 novel ""Incident at Muc Wa."" The movie is unique in the fact that it deals with the U.S. Advisory Command in Vietnam and not the full-blown war we are all used to. Finding anything about the Advisory Command is tough, and this movie delivers with great action and pleasure.This movie to me is Burt Lancaster's best role ever. He absolutely nails the part of hard nosed, tough and rough Major Asa Barker. Marc Singer and Jonathan Goldsmith(the most interesting man in the world guy) also ass wonderful parts as well. The premise of the movie is U.S. Advisors training South Vietnamese troops to combat the communist North. This, as we all well know, didn't work out too well. The movie shows how we as Americans blindly think that everyone in the world is an American waiting to get out, but often times these people don't want us anywhere around them. The part of the movie where Cprl. Lincoln says, ""these people could switch sides and never know any difference"" sums the war up in a nutshell. The movie also mixes in some comedy, and this is what sets the movie apart from most other Nam movies of the era. Lancaster and Singer make me laugh several times throughout, but they never lead you too far away from the stuff happening in the field.I served in the U.S. Army Airborne and am darned proud of it.

Not Excellent, but good.My concern is actually more with the presentation of certain movies of this kind on DVD.Like Universal Pictures, HBO and others seem to always revert to the FULL SCREEN video format to dish up their DVDs.Many of the very same movies are available, through the same distribution companies in the UK, in their originalWIDESCREEN (either Letterboxed or Anamorphic) format. Sometimes in a ratio of 1.85:1, other times in 2.35:1.While I can still understand a Full Screen presentation (1.33:1 ratio) for a 1.85:1 movie, why do the U.S. distributorsalways resort to Full Screen?The sources, in many cases, are the same. Yet many movies, like for instance ""Colossus - The Forbin Project"", ""CharleyVarrick"" and here ""Go Tell the Spartans"" are simply transferred in 1.33:1 (full screen) for U.S. DVD release, whiletheir UK counterpart comes in their original screen aspect ratio (with a very few exceptions to the rule).So my question is, what is wrong with American distributors?I am also thinking about the U.S. viewer who is not so fortunate as to have the money to afford a code-free player, in orderto actually order them from the UK, with their included additional international postage expenses.It is a funny globalized world, where nothing is really globalized.One would have assumed that at least in the Western Free World such differences would have been overcome in time.But alas, no such luck!While we are threatened from every corner of the world, we still amuse ourselves in bickering and find cultural and linguisticdifferences within our own Countries.And just to add insult to irony, we have so many non-sense commercial practices that seem concocted more by complete morons,rather than judicious and wise corporate people.China and Asia in general must really be grateful of so much incompetence and greed.It is all playing in their hands.Mind you, I have nothing against our Asian friends.

I tend to be more interested in conflicts from other periods and times.  I think Vietnam is a byword that is still over-used in this country.  Other nations have sustained for worse set-backs in their history and have gott'en over it without all the agony that this conflict still seems to have on us.  Perhaps it is because we have not matured as a nation as much, nor is our history as long and bloody as others.Nonetheless, this is still a pretty good film for what is is.  The film concentrates on the early years of US involvement in Southeast Asia.  Burt Lancaster leads a mixed outfit of US advisors and rag-tag volunteers agaisnt the Cong.  The film shows how haphazzard operations were in that early stage of the war.  Politics and senseless operations were already beginning to rear their ugly head.  The movie shows a lot of the prejudice that US personnel harbored toward a people and conflict they little understood.  This would certainly be considered not politically correct today!  Also the brutality of Vietminese toward each other is amply shown.  This was a Civil War as much as a war of idealogies.  Burt Lancaster and his crew of misfits are eventually overwhelmed at the desolute sounding place of mud-huts called Muc Wu.  The film seems based losely on a historical event.The Spartan quote I think it somewhat mis-used, but the niaveness of the US personnel thinking they could do better than the French before them is amusing.  In the end, even with all our firepower and might, we would lose more men and resources than the French!  This film shows the beginnings of that tragedy that would ruin much of the social fabric of this country at the time.  We are still suffering from it.

889707,A3JLKDUV0B6O5U,B0007TKNDI,TFR,"[5, 6]","If you can get by the whole idea that the military advisors as portrayed in ""Go Tell the Spartans"" don't have whitewall haircuts and the fact that the film isn't a big-budget recreation of combat in the Ia Drang valley, then you might be able to take ""Go Tell the Spartans"" for what it is:  A film that attempts to shed some light on the sort of activities that were taking place in South Vietnam two years prior to the first deployment of combat troops, a US Marine battalion landing team in 1965.I liked ""Go Tell the Spartans"" because I thought it was unpretentious.  In some ways, the film is flawed, but no more flawed than ""The Green Berets,"" a John Wayne vehicle that was filmed on location at Fort Benning, Georgia, and looks it.  (If you look closely, you can actually see the Chatahoochee River at one point.  Talk about flawed: Unbelievably, the film ends with John Wayne hiking up a little kid to his arm and walking into the sunset over the South China Sea - to the east.)Then there's the other direction, as in ""Apocalypse Now,"" with the Do Long Bridge sequence.  That whole thing was unreal.  A bridge lit up at night in the middle of a combat zone with grunts running around here and there, for no apparent purpose.  Ridiculous.I'm not going to go into a synopsis of ""Go Tell the Spartans"", which you can read about in the other reviews.  I will say that I liked the character that Burt Lancaster portrayed, and could understand the others.I will also say that the production crew did get a lot of the equipment right.  The Nungs were using M-1's and carbines, not M-16's.  The helicopters were Sikorskys, not Hueys.There are only three noteworthy characters:The character 2LT Hamilton was basically a gimmick thrown into the story.  His purpose is only to show the naivette of all American citizens - not necessarily service members - with regard to the culture of war existing in Vietnam at that time.  A green kid, fresh out of college and ROTC or maybe OCS, Hamilton lacks the cynicism that will allow him to stay alive.  He is preoccupied with fighting and concluding World War II and fails to recognize the concept of asymetrical warfare when confronted with it.The character CPL Courcey (Wasson) is the ""Everyman"" character who ultimately survives.  He too is a college grad, but unlike Hamilton, is a draftee.  Like Hamilton, he has some of the same ""Give `em the benefit of the doubt"" attitudes, but is not as steadfast in his opinion of his surroundings.The character MAJ Barker (Lancaster):  He's old brown boot army.  Even though he wasn't with Pershing in Mexico, he probably talked to old hands who were.  He's old, he's tired, and he should have been put out to pasture a long time ago.  The worst part is that he understands he's reached a dead end.The ending of the story should come as no surprise to anyone who watches the film closely and pays attention.  When First Sergeant Oleonowski (Goldsmith) kills himself, that's the albatross sighting.  As the situation deteriorates further, Hamilton is killed, the majority of the advisory team leaves, and then finally, only Courcey and Barker are left.In the end, Coucey does not walk away into the sunset and talk about freedom and winning the hearts and minds.  He doesn't even talk about being the meanest SOB in the valley or about letting the gooks play the indians.Instead, as if he were in some weird episode of the Twilight Zone, Courcey realizes that he's reached a dead end.If nothing else, ""Go tell the Spartans"" is good food for thought.  Although it wasn't something I'd want to watch again and again, I'd recommend it to anyone who has a general interest in cinema that relates to the Vietnam era.",5,"""I did the one thing I was trained to do: I saluted!""",1233187200,"01 29, 2009",2009,3692,"['can', 'get', 'whole', 'idea', 'military', 'advisors', 'portrayed', 'Go', 'Tell', 'Spartans', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'whitewall', 'haircuts', 'fact', 'film', ""n't"", 'big-budget', 'recreation', 'combat', 'Ia', 'Drang', 'valley', 'then', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'take', 'Go', 'Tell', 'Spartans', 'what', 'film', 'shed', 'light', 'sort', 'activities', 'were', 'taking', 'place', 'South', 'Vietnam', 'two', 'years', 'prior', 'first', 'deployment', 'combat', 'troops', 'US', 'Marine', 'battalion', 'landing', 'team', '1965.I', 'liked', 'Go', 'Tell', 'Spartans', 'thought', 'was', 'unpretentious', 'ways', 'film', 'flawed', 'more', 'flawed', 'Green', 'Berets', 'John', 'Wayne', 'vehicle', 'was', 'filmed', 'location', 'Fort', 'Benning', 'Georgia', 'look', 'closely', 'can', 'actually', 'see', 'Chatahoochee', 'River', 'one', 'point', 'Talk', 'flawed', 'Unbelievably', 'film', 'John', 'Wayne', 'hiking', 'up', 'little', 'kid', 'arm', 'walking', 'sunset', 'South', 'China', 'Sea', 'east', 'Then', 'other', 'direction', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'Do', 'Long', 'Bridge', 'sequence', 'whole', 'thing', 'was', 'unreal', 'bridge', 'lit', 'up', 'night', 'middle', 'combat', 'zone', 'grunts', 'running', 'around', 'here', 'there', 'apparent', 'purpose', 'Ridiculous.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'go', 'synopsis', 'Go', 'Tell', 'Spartans', 'can', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'will', 'say', 'liked', 'character', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'portrayed', 'could', 'understand', 'others.I', 'will', 'also', 'say', 'production', 'crew', 'did', 'get', 'lot', 'equipment', 'right', 'Nungs', 'were', 'using', 'M-1', 'carbines', 'not', 'M-16', 'helicopters', 'were', 'Sikorskys', 'not', 'Hueys.There', 'are', 'only', 'three', 'noteworthy', 'characters', 'character', '2LT', 'Hamilton', 'was', 'basically', 'gimmick', 'thrown', 'story', 'purpose', 'only', 'show', 'naivette', 'American', 'citizens', 'not', 'necessarily', 'service', 'members', 'regard', 'culture', 'war', 'existing', 'Vietnam', 'time', 'green', 'kid', 'fresh', 'college', 'ROTC', 'maybe', 'OCS', 'Hamilton', 'cynicism', 'will', 'allow', 'stay', 'alive', 'preoccupied', 'fighting', 'concluding', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'fails', 'recognize', 'concept', 'asymetrical', 'warfare', 'when', 'confronted', 'it.The', 'character', 'CPL', 'Courcey', 'Wasson', 'Everyman', 'character', 'who', 'ultimately', 'too', 'college', 'grad', 'Hamilton', 'draftee', 'Hamilton', 'same', 'Give', 'em', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'attitudes', 'not', 'steadfast', 'opinion', 'surroundings.The', 'character', 'MAJ', 'Barker', 'Lancaster', 'old', 'brown', 'boot', 'army', 'Even', 'was', ""n't"", 'Pershing', 'Mexico', 'probably', 'talked', 'old', 'hands', 'who', 'were', 'old', 'tired', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'put', 'out', 'pasture', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'worst', 'part', 'reached', 'dead', 'end.The', 'ending', 'story', 'should', 'come', 'surprise', 'anyone', 'who', 'film', 'closely', 'attention', 'When', 'First', 'Sergeant', 'Oleonowski', 'Goldsmith', 'albatross', 'sighting', 'situation', 'further', 'Hamilton', 'killed', 'majority', 'advisory', 'team', 'leaves', 'then', 'finally', 'only', 'Courcey', 'Barker', 'are', 'end', 'Coucey', 'not', 'walk', 'away', 'sunset', 'talk', 'freedom', 'winning', 'hearts', 'minds', ""n't"", 'even', 'talk', 'being', 'meanest', 'SOB', 'valley', 'letting', 'gooks', 'play', 'indians.Instead', 'were', 'weird', 'episode', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'Courcey', 'reached', 'dead', 'end.If', 'nothing', 'else', 'Go', 'tell', 'Spartans', 'good', 'food', 'thought', 'was', ""n't"", 'something', ""'d"", 'want', 'watch', 'again', 'again', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'general', 'interest', 'cinema', 'Vietnam', 'era']",N/A
889708,A2Q13PHEXGR48Q,B0007TKNDI,T O'Brien,"[5, 6]","Go Tell the Spartans is an excellent war picture about a topic not often dealt with in movies, the American involvement in Vietnam in the early 1960s. In 1964, Major Asa Barker is an American advisor at Advisory Group 7 in Penang. He receives orders to send out a garrison for an abandoned outpost that has little to no strategic value. When the outpost as Muc Wa comes under heavy attack by the Viet Cong, Barker must deal with some unexpected problems that he did not see coming. This is not the most well-known movie about Vietnam, maybe because of the topic, but it is an excellent movie telling the story of the American advisors in Vietnam before a significant number of American troops became involved in the conflict. The cast is excellent, the battle scenes are not epic but are very well choreographed, and you really get a sense of what the situation in Vietnam in 1964 was like for these American advisors. And for $8.99, what can you lose?Burt Lancaster is the lone ""big name"" in Go Tell the Spartans as Maj. Asa Barker, the American advisor who must keep command of understaffed and underequipped outposts in Vietnam. Lancaster, who was 65 when this was released, brings a sort of world-weary to this role as his character is a veteran of both WWII and Korea. Some of the other ""advisors"" include Craig Wasson as Cpl. Courcey, the idealistic draftee, Jonathan Goldsmith as Sgt. Oleonowski, the frazzled but experienced vet, Marc Singer as Capt. Olivetti, Barker's executive officer, Joe Unger as Lt. Hamilton, the inexperienced and once again idealistic officer, and Dennis Howard as Cpl. Abe Lincoln, the medic. The movie also stars Evan Kim as Cowboy Nguyen, the Vietnamese scout, John Megna as Ackley, the radioman, David Clennon, Hilly Hicks, and Dolph Sweet. The DVD features the movie in its standard presentation, pan-n-scan, and a trailer, so you're not getting much extras-wise, but the movie is pretty cheap anyways.

889711,A2ZIDCYC0GWWKF,B0007TKNDI,"Vladislav ""Tepes""","[6, 7]","This is an exceptionally good movie on the absurdity of the Military trying to fulfill a mission, but unfortunately the politicians, bureaucrats, and ""Career Soldiers"" [not Professional Soldiers]ran the show from 8,000 miles away in Washington D.C. This happens more than people will believe; that local commanders are not free to use their initiative to carry out the missions. Civilians should give the military a mission, then get the hell out of the way. This was especially true in Vietnam under L.B.J. and Mr. McNamara, who literally ran the war out of the Oval Office daily on an hourly basis. The absurdity of the war can be shown with the Easter Offensive and Linebacker-2, in 1972 when President Nixon declared ALL of North Vietnam a target. To get the North back to the peace talks from their new Offensive against South Vietnam, he sent wave after wave of B-52's North dropping bombs which brought the North to the edge of total collapse. This could have been done in 1966, and think of all of the lives on both sides that could have been spared. Instead, they were  busy ""sending messages"" about what America could do, but was 'beneficent' in holding back.This movie is based on a true story, but not one likely to go down in the annals of greatness of the US Army. And it was absolutely an omen of how things would go in that war. We could not win in the manner in which the war was fought.The movie also shows the camaraderie, and the willingness of the soldiers to carry out the mission, regardless of how hopeless-take it from a Scout with the 1St Cavalry Division who knows.One of the two best movies on Vietnam, the other being, ""A Rumor of War.""",5,A Grunt's Eye  View,1241654400,"05 7, 2009",2009,1665,"['exceptionally', 'good', 'movie', 'absurdity', 'Military', 'trying', 'fulfill', 'mission', 'unfortunately', 'politicians', 'bureaucrats', 'Career', 'Soldiers', 'not', 'Professional', 'Soldiers', ']', 'ran', 'show', '8,000', 'miles', 'away', 'Washington', 'D.C', 'more', 'people', 'will', 'believe', 'local', 'commanders', 'are', 'not', 'free', 'use', 'initiative', 'carry', 'out', 'missions', 'Civilians', 'should', 'give', 'military', 'mission', 'then', 'get', 'hell', 'way', 'was', 'especially', 'true', 'Vietnam', 'L.B.J', 'Mr.', 'McNamara', 'who', 'literally', 'ran', 'war', 'Oval', 'Office', 'daily', 'hourly', 'basis', 'absurdity', 'war', 'can', 'be', 'shown', 'Easter', 'Offensive', 'Linebacker-2', '1972', 'when', 'President', 'Nixon', 'declared', 'ALL', 'North', 'Vietnam', 'target', 'get', 'North', 'back', 'peace', 'talks', 'new', 'Offensive', 'South', 'Vietnam', 'sent', 'wave', 'wave', 'B-52', 'North', 'dropping', 'bombs', 'brought', 'North', 'edge', 'total', 'collapse', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', '1966', 'think', 'lives', 'sides', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'spared', 'Instead', 'were', 'busy', 'sending', 'messages', 'what', 'America', 'could', 'do', 'was', ""'beneficent"", 'holding', 'back.This', 'movie', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'not', 'one', 'likely', 'go', 'down', 'annals', 'greatness', 'US', 'Army', 'was', 'absolutely', 'omen', 'how', 'things', 'would', 'go', 'war', 'could', 'not', 'win', 'manner', 'war', 'was', 'fought.The', 'movie', 'also', 'camaraderie', 'willingness', 'soldiers', 'carry', 'out', 'mission', 'regardless', 'how', 'hopeless-take', 'Scout', '1St', 'Cavalry', 'Division', 'who', 'knows.One', 'two', 'best', 'movies', 'Vietnam', 'other', 'being', 'Rumor', 'War']",N/A

Period not visited much... the true advisor period before the massive buildup....The budget was very low... but the results are stunning.  From a technical standpoint the haircuts are way too long... but in most other respects the ""feel"" is right....The seeds of so many problems on the horizon appear... like a Greek tragedy where you know what is coming, but nothing can stop it.  The brilliant musical score underlines the sense of combined courage and futility....The ancient Viet Minh (precurser to Viet Cong) haunting his old battlefield lends a touch of the surreal to the film... And the French cemetary with the sign quoting the stone marking the spot where the long dead Spartans lay... gives what otherwise might be a squalid series of mistakes an almost Homeric touch......The patriotic but not very bright lieutenant out of his depth... The draftee whose ideals don't hold up to the ugly reality... the young captain whose focus is on duty and ambition... and the old soldier who would have been happier dying in a larger and simpler war......Don't let any of the negative reviews put you off...
