746714,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B00008QSAI,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[0, 1]","Hmmm.  Well, some people love Elmo, some people hate him.  My daughter kind of likes him, although I try and keep exposure to a minimum... I'm an old-school Sesame Street fan, but I've always loathed Elmo's super-cutesiness and vacuuous presentation.  This video is okay -- there is some admirable educational content, but jeez, is Elmo whiny.  And at some point in every episode there'd come a moment when I could swear I could hear my kid's brain cells popping.  It's hard to find intelligent, inoffensive, unscary, nonviolent media for toddlers to enjoy, and with Elmo, I'd say two out of four ain't bad... On balance, I'd say this disc -- like other ""Elmo's World"" videos -- has its merits, but there are parts of it that are a little insulting to the intelligence of little viewers.  Parents might want to preview it first, not because it's scary or whatever, but just to see if it's really what they want to have flooding their kid's mind.  I finally decided it was too dumb, and am looking for better material.

Like all the others, it is very consistent, and Elmo is consistent in his approach to learning.  The Wild Animals were a little ""in your face"" in the beginning, and the really young ones might be taken back, as well as ""The Weather"" portion where the Wind comes into Elmo's house and almost blows him away, but it's a generally cute video for those Elmo-tykes like my twin daughters, and...Elmo still makes me laugh!!!Highly recommended!!!",5,"Fish, Weather, Wild Animals, and ELMO!!",1108512000,"02 16, 2005",2005,571,"['series', 'three', 'short', 'vignettes', 'are', 'wonderful', 'tools', 'teach', 'young', 'ones', 'various', 'topics', 'others', 'very', 'consistent', 'Elmo', 'consistent', 'approach', 'learning', 'Wild', 'Animals', 'were', 'little', 'face', 'beginning', 'really', 'young', 'ones', 'might', 'be', 'taken', 'back', 'as', 'well', 'Weather', 'portion', 'where', 'Wind', 'Elmo', 'house', 'almost', 'blows', 'away', 'generally', 'cute', 'video', 'Elmo-tykes', 'twin', 'daughters', 'Elmo', 'still', 'Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

Garrard ""the G-man""","[18, 19]","To contrast the other less-than-favorable reviews, I had to add my ""thumbs up"" rating for this superbly educational tape from the Sesame Street folk.  Long being an admirer of the cute Muppet known as ""Elmo"", I couldn't wait to watch this one with my four-year-old niece and her two-year-old brother.  Both kids are totally captivated by Elmo's informative and entertaining ""lessons"" on animals in the wild.Elmo is definitely a kid favorite.The creators of this lovable character realize that his wide-eyed enthusiasm and infectious laugh are the perfect blend to tap into the innocence and curiosity of children.  The late Michael Jeter is also on hand as the childlike ""Mr. Noodles"" who also knows a thing or two about engaging little minds.All children are different and while a few may be ""frightened"" by the big bad wolf, I can assure you that my two young relatives found nothing terrifying at all in this wonderful tape.",5,Preschoolers know what THEY like!,1065052800,"10 2, 2003",2003,927,"['contrast', 'other', 'less-than-favorable', 'reviews', 'had', 'add', 'thumbs', 'up', 'rating', 'superbly', 'educational', 'tape', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'folk', 'Long', 'being', 'admirer', 'cute', 'Muppet', 'known', 'Elmo', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'watch', 'one', 'four-year-old', 'niece', 'two-year-old', 'brother', 'kids', 'are', 'totally', 'captivated', 'Elmo', 'informative', 'entertaining', 'lessons', 'animals', 'wild.Elmo', 'definitely', 'kid', 'favorite.The', 'creators', 'lovable', 'character', 'realize', 'wide-eyed', 'enthusiasm', 'infectious', 'laugh', 'are', 'perfect', 'blend', 'tap', 'innocence', 'curiosity', 'children', 'late', 'Michael', 'Jeter', 'also', 'hand', 'childlike', 'Mr.', 'Noodles', 'who', 'also', 'thing', 'two', 'engaging', 'little', 'minds.All', 'children', 'are', 'different', 'few', 'may', 'be', 'frightened', 'big', 'bad', 'wolf', 'can', 'assure', 'two', 'young', 'relatives', 'found', 'nothing', 'terrifying', 'wonderful', 'tape']",N/A
