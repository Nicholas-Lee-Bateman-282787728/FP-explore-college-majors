I saw it when it first came out and have had Cat Stevens' songs in my head ever since.  It's one of those personally affecting movies that prompts fans to quote from it, and my favorite moment after all these years is (as it is for some of these other writers) Maude flinging Harold's charm into the river, because now she'll &quot;always know where it is.&quot;  That was my first taste of movie profundity, and I've never lost it.If you haven't seen the movie yet, you can probably read some of these posts and not have it ruined for you.

Not everyone shares my enthusiasm, however, because Harold, a young man whose Socialite mother is pushing him to get married, is completely obsessed with staging suicides. The reason for these antics is revealed later in the movie.Harold (Bud Cort) is a loner unable to find anyone to whom he can relate, until he accidentally bumps into Maude (Ruth Gordon), a 79 yr old ""free spirit."" Her spontaneous actions and philosophy in life, shaped by her unpleasant past, appeals to Harold and he gradually finds the soulmate for whom he is searching. This obviously horrifies Harold's mother and family associates.The situations throughout the movie are very funny, enhanced by a great Cat Stevens score.Maude's philosophy will have a positive appeal to anyone looking at life through jaded lenses.The movie's ending is emotionally intense but surprisingly satisfying.  This movie is considered a ""cult classic,"" so that should alert you to the fact that not everyone may like its humor. However, I believe it is one of the great films from the early 1970s.

220551,AGEIT17HENDIS,6300216268,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 0]","Some films, especially coming of age films of either the political or social kind, do not age well. That is the fate of the early 1970s cult classic of sorts, Harold and Maude. This was a film that some friends of mine in Cambridge would queue up for on a weekly basis, and gladly, at one particular theater that played the film and only that film for about a year. See, that was the time of the great attempted late 1960s break-out from the confines of bourgeois society and the tracked career path by all kinds of people and Harold seemed a kindred spirit, and was then. Maude, needless to say was everybody's grandmother dream, if only compared to harsh mother reality, and if you liked little old ladies in tennis sneakers. And you should.The premise of the film certainly had appeal, teen angst, big time teen angst by the distraught Harold (Bud Cort) trying to, against his class background and his monster mother's well-laid plans for his future, fight for his place in the world (or the next world in his faux fascination with death and funerals) and old age angst (happy angst, if that is not an oxymoron) by the bubbly Maude (Ruth Gordon). By the end of the film old Ruth is able to bring Bud around to seeing that life, his life, is worth living. Well, ho hum for the premise now, now that some of us are approaching old Maude's age.What is false here, maybe not as false as some things we have learned along the way but false nevertheless, is Maude's aged wisdom. The truth, the bitter truth, is that the wisdom we acquired was done so in our youth and we have been living off that, chipping away at the edges, ever since. What still holds up, and holds well, is the sound track of Cat Stevens' (now Yusuf Islam) great songs like Wild World and Where Do The Children Play?

From that point forward, the film takes us on a really strange yet heartwarming and honest journey through one man&#8217;s coming of age and one woman&#8217;s passing.  Tonally, this is a black comedy, but it is so much smarter than that title would suggest.  Maude is this beacon of wisdom that helps mold an otherwise directionless Harold who is in deep need of guidance he&#8217;s opposed to accepting.  Through this oddly comprised relationship, we are given insight into the most profound aspects of love and the blossoming truths that are set ablaze here are insanely accurate and moving.And let&#8217;s not dismiss the incredible performances by Ruth Gordon, Bud Cort and Vivian Pickles, all of whom bring so much to their respective roles.One of my favorites of the 70&#8217;s (or any decade, for that matter), &#8216;Harold and Maude&#8217; is a film you won&#8217;t soon shake!",5,A deep well of forethought&#8230;,1393977600,"03 5, 2014",2014,1541,"['films', 'come', 'nowhere', 'just', 'grab', 'everything', 'sparking', 'something', 'didn', '8217', 'expect', 'speaking', 'universal', 'truths', 'never', 'saw', 'coming', '8216', 'Harold', 'Maude', '8217', 'one', 'such', 'film', 'tender', 'surprisingly', 'astute', 'look', 'relationships', 'mind', 'Hal', 'Ashby', 'man', 'who', 'gave', '8216', 'Coming', 'Home', '8217', '8216', 'Being', '8217', '8216', 'Last', 'Detail', '8217', 'impressive', 'filmography', '8217', 'only', 'sampling.', '8216', 'Harold', 'Maude', '8217', 'story', 'death', 'obsessed', 'teenager', 'who', 'friendship', 'more', 'seventy-nine', 'year', 'old', 'anarchist', 'attending', 'funeral', 'point', 'forward', 'film', 'really', 'strange', 'yet', 'heartwarming', 'honest', 'journey', 'one', 'man', '8217', 'coming', 'age', 'one', 'woman', '8217', 'passing', 'Tonally', 'black', 'comedy', 'so', 'much', 'smarter', 'title', 'would', 'suggest', 'Maude', 'beacon', 'wisdom', 'mold', 'otherwise', 'directionless', 'Harold', 'who', 'deep', 'need', 'guidance', '8217', 's', 'opposed', 'accepting', 'oddly', 'comprised', 'relationship', 'are', 'given', 'insight', 'most', 'profound', 'aspects', 'love', 'blossoming', 'truths', 'are', 'set', 'here', 'are', 'insanely', 'accurate', 'moving.And', 'let', '8217', 'not', 'dismiss', 'incredible', 'performances', 'Ruth', 'Gordon', 'Bud', 'Cort', 'Vivian', 'Pickles', 'whom', 'bring', 'so', 'much', 'respective', 'roles.One', 'favorites', '70', '8217', 'decade', 'matter', '8216', 'Harold', 'Maude', '8217', 'film', 'won', '8217', 'soon', 'shake']",N/A

Although somewhat dated by folky Cat Stevens tunes and Vietnam War-era overtones, the main story remains a powerful one.Harold is a 20-year-old rudderless son of wealth. Obssessed with mortality, Harold frightens off any girls his mother arranges dates for him with by simulating his own suicide, using a variety of tricks in the process. He converts a gift sports car into a creepy mini-hearse and indulges in his favorite pastime, attending the funerals of strangers. It is at one of these that Harold first meets Maude, a spry 79-year-old lady with a zeal for living that is positively infectious.The two embark on several adventures, which include rescuing a dead city tree to plant it in the woods, and giving Harold's patriotic Army officer uncle a shocking surprise. Through all this, Maude teaches the youth how to play banjo and most importantly: how to embrace life. Harold declares his love for this amazing old gal and clings to her despite protests from family and minister.

She is a great character study. The ending was not too shabby. One of the biggest drawbacks in Harold and Maude, I sensed a holding back. Say if Harold and Maude were in love with each other, I never see the extremes of it. Just a peck here or there. So, I give points off for that. That's not avant garde enough for me. It has to be incredibly daring just in the same manner as the content was presented. Disappointingly, Harold and Maude fell short of the lovers department. Overall, Harold and Maude is a great romantic picture that probably will soothe a majority of the folks, maybe not so for the genteel.

Its at one of these gatherings that he first meets Maude (Ruth Gordon), a 79 year old who is not your average crocheting, cookie baking Grandma. For leisure Maude likes to steal cars. And from here their friendship grows, with the eternally optimistic Maude encouraging Harold to embrace life instead of dwelling upon death. Their relationship soon blossoms into an unconventional, but true love; which again meets with mother's disapproval.Written &amp; Co-Produced by Colin Higgins, HAROLD AND MAUDE was unfairly overlooked on its initial release but over the years gained a strong following; and todays ranks as one of the very best black comedies/love stories ever made. Special highlights for me included Harold's efforts to escape being drafted into the army, and also Harold's hari-kiri &quot;suicide&quot; demonstration for one of the young women his mother has set him up with.Both leads are excellent, especially Bud Cort; who was/is so convincing in his role that he found himself typecast for life- and some people really believed he was as &quot;out there&quot; as Harold in real life!!  So poor old Bud was given the silver lining before the cloud! Hopefully one day some director will use his talents in the way he deserves. Ruth Gordon is hard to resist as Maude- she's probably the kind of Grandma every kid wishes they had.Of course, the movie is also famous for the soundtrack by Cat Stevens which complements the film beautifully. If you haven't seen HAROLD AND MAUDE before then I strongly urge you to rent a copy. It's not for all tastes with its inconventional love story and its (often very) black humor; but this is one of those rare films that leaves you feeling alive and exhilarated after watching it and commands repeat viewings. Unless you're a P.C old prat who believes the &quot;suicides&quot; in the movie to be &quot;injurious to the public good&quot;(!!) and the idea of a 20 year old and an 80 year old being in love to be &quot;immoral&quot;. (No prizes for guessing who I'm talking about). Maybe a little icky.The DVD features aren't great, just a couple of different trailers for the film; but I can't recommend this movie highly enough. Put it on your must-see list. HAROLD AND MAUDE gets my seal of approval (Woop de doo, I hear you say) and despite being more than 30 years old it doesn't appear to have dated at all, and remains relevant today. Watch it and judge for yourself.",5,A movie worthy of both cult AND classic status.,1068508800,"11 11, 2003",2003,3164,"['one', 'THE', 'original', 'cult', 'movies', '4', 'years', 'ROCKY', 'HORROR', 'amp', '7', 'years', 'BLOODSUCKING', 'FREAKS', 'Bud', 'Cort', '20', 'year', 'old', 'Harold', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'morbid', 'fascination', 'death', 'leisure', 'long-suffering', 'mother', 'mad', 'enacting', 'fake', 'suicides', 'get', 'attention', 'such', 'quot', 'hanging', 'quot', 'quot', 'slashing', 'quot', 'throat', 'wrists', 'much', 'chagrin', 'Harold', 'pompous', 'mother', 'who', 'see', 'shrink', 'true', 'believer', 'old', 'quot', 'best', 'quot', 'adage', 'answers', 'out', 'questionaire', 'son', 'not', 'surprising', 'when', 'learn', 'Harold', 'hearse', 'leisure', 'strangers', 'funerals.However', 'one', 'such', 'funeral', 'changes', 'Harold', 'life', 'forever', 'one', 'gatherings', 'first', 'Maude', 'Ruth', 'Gordon', '79', 'year', 'old', 'who', 'not', 'average', 'crocheting', 'cookie', 'baking', 'Grandma', 'leisure', 'Maude', 'steal', 'cars', 'here', 'friendship', 'grows', 'eternally', 'optimistic', 'Maude', 'encouraging', 'Harold', 'embrace', 'life', 'instead', 'dwelling', 'death', 'relationship', 'soon', 'blossoms', 'unconventional', 'true', 'love', 'again', 'mother', 'disapproval.Written', 'amp', 'Co-Produced', 'Colin', 'Higgins', 'HAROLD', 'AND', 'MAUDE', 'was', 'unfairly', 'overlooked', 'initial', 'release', 'years', 'gained', 'strong', 'following', 'ranks', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'black', 'comedies/love', 'stories', 'ever', 'made', 'Special', 'highlights', 'included', 'Harold', 'efforts', 'escape', 'being', 'drafted', 'army', 'also', 'Harold', 'hari-kiri', 'quot', 'quot', 'demonstration', 'one', 'young', 'women', 'mother', 'set', 'up', 'leads', 'are', 'excellent', 'especially', 'Bud', 'Cort', 'who', 'was/is', 'so', 'convincing', 'role', 'found', 'typecast', 'life-', 'people', 'really', 'believed', 'was', 'quot', 'quot', 'Harold', 'real', 'life', 'So', 'poor', 'old', 'Bud', 'was', 'given', 'silver', 'lining', 'cloud', 'Hopefully', 'one', 'day', 'director', 'will', 'use', 'talents', 'way', 'Ruth', 'Gordon', 'hard', 'resist', 'Maude-', 'probably', 'kind', 'Grandma', 'kid', 'had.Of', 'course', 'movie', 'also', 'famous', 'soundtrack', 'Cat', 'Stevens', 'film', 'beautifully', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'HAROLD', 'AND', 'MAUDE', 'then', 'strongly', 'urge', 'rent', 'copy', 'not', 'tastes', 'inconventional', 'love', 'story', 'often', 'very', 'black', 'humor', 'one', 'rare', 'films', 'feeling', 'alive', 'exhilarated', 'watching', 'repeat', 'viewings', ""'re"", 'P.C', 'old', 'prat', 'who', 'quot', 'quot', 'movie', 'be', 'quot', 'injurious', 'public', 'good', 'quot', 'idea', '20', 'year', 'old', '80', 'year', 'old', 'being', 'love', 'be', 'quot', 'immoral', 'quot', 'prizes', 'guessing', 'who', ""'m"", 'talking', 'Maybe', 'little', 'icky.The', 'DVD', 'features', 'are', ""n't"", 'great', 'just', 'couple', 'different', 'trailers', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'highly', 'enough', 'Put', 'must-see', 'list', 'HAROLD', 'MAUDE', 'seal', 'approval', 'Woop', 'de', 'doo', 'hear', 'say', 'being', 'more', '30', 'years', 'old', ""n't"", 'appear', 'have', 'dated', 'relevant', 'today', 'Watch', 'judge']",N/A

220571,APP5MBH2BSX6I,6300216268,"Brian Hulett ""okierazorbacker2""","[10, 10]","One of the most delightfully oddball comedies you'll ever see, ""Harold and Maude"" features Bud Cort (an eccentric young actor best known otherwise only as a Hollywood party guest) as eccentric young Harold, son of a remarkably self-absorbed and pretentious wealthy widow who sees her son in a notably dysfunctional way.  Harold responds by trying to shock her into showing some kind of sign that she cares about him at all, while the only such sign forthcoming is a hilarious scene with the mother filling out Harold's personality survey for a computer dating service by answering all the questions herself, Harold never uttering a word.  So much for one's individuality.Enter Maude, played by Ruth Gordon (forever earning her a permanent and special place in the hearts of millions), the personification of the phrase ""free spirit.""  She sees things quite differently from anyone else in the world, and in a delicious twist of irony Harold, who has been trying to shake up his mother, gets shaken up himself by this elderly hippie.  While some of the things that follow are clearly over the edge, Harold ultimately learns that one can be one's own self without being overly concerned of what others think, even his own overbearing mother.  Enter a happy ending that's as unconventional as anything else in this film.There are moral issues a-plenty to deal with here.  A young man having an affair with a woman 60 years his senior, suicide, personal property issues, attitudes toward the military, etc.  These things had a quite different angle when this film was made in the early 1970s, so in some ways HaM is a bit dated.

It was directed by a member of ""the greatest generation"" (Hal Ashby) about a member of his parents' generation (Maude) helping a member of the baby boomers' generation (Harold) choose to seize life rather than go on embracing a kind of living death. The details of the film have been rehashed by several hundred previous reviewers, so I won't do that once again. I will point out that it is interesting that the intended audience for this film - the baby boomers of 1971 who were then in their teens and twenties who so embraced this film then and still do through all of the websites dedicated to its nostalgia - have become what they claimed to abhor in this movie over the last 35 years. They have, in fact, become the most prudish bunch of old people since the Puritans landed at Plymouth Rock. Their collective slogan has changed from ""Let It All Hang Out"" to ""Let All Who Do Not Conform Be Hanged!"". Thanks to the collective legislative efforts of the baby boomers - shortly to begin their second stint in diapers - we do not dare let a 20 year old (Harold's age in the movie) drink one beer even in the bedroom of his own house. We do not dare let bar owners (now only in some jurisdictions, but coming soon to a jurisdiction near you!) allow smoking in their establishments by anyone no matter what their age, and worst of all the land is dotted with zero-tolerance policies in which a child who shows up to school with an unauthorized aspirin is often treated the same as a child who shows up to school with crack cocaine or a gun as far as expulsion goes.The point of my rant is this - If the Maude of the film were somehow brought back to life today, more than likely she would find Harold acting more like his mother than even his mother did and would likely want to take that handful of pills that ended her life a second time - for completely different reasons.This really is a great film, and I would really hope that when I am 79 I am a cross between the Maude of this movie and Einstein and his compadres in the film ""IQ"". More than that though, I watch this film to remind me how it is a daily battle to stay young at heart and open to the simple pleasures of life.

220575,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,6300216268,C. B Collins Jr.,"[0, 0]","This is a film about a young man running toward death and an old woman running toward life. They run into each other and a fine film results. The three main characters, Harold, Maud, and Harold's father, are exceptional and make the film highly entertaining through the tensions between Harold and Maud and Harold and his mother. Ruth Gordon is such a fine actress that she makes this film soar. Her approach to this eccentric character is warm and life affirming.  Bud Cort is superb as Harold, looking all of 17 years old throughout the film. Vivian Pickles is also superb as Harold's mother.  Maud is a mentor and muse for the somber Harold and through adventure after adventure he opens up to the life experiences around him. There is one scene which summarizes Maud's wisdom. When she is being taken into an emergency room on a stretcher, Harold says: ""But Maud I love you."" To which Maud lovingly and serenely answers: ""That is wonderful Harold, now go out and love some more.""  The simplicity and truth behind this short exchange struck me to the heart. The film is totally life affirming and the dark humor helps make it more so.Because the film makes fun of the fashion of the times, the fact that it was made in 1971 does not date the film but rather seems more like a sly commentary on the hair, jewelry, clothes, and cars of that period. Cat Steven's soundtrack is joyful and a perfect compliment to the 1970 feel of the movie and its themes.The film is now almost 40 years old and has become an American classic; primarily because the themes explored around the tensions, the push and pull, between our desire to live and our desire to give up are so perfectly portrayed in the film.",5,A quirky life affirming classic film,1263427200,"01 14, 2010",2010,1696,"['film', 'young', 'man', 'running', 'death', 'old', 'woman', 'running', 'life', 'run', 'other', 'fine', 'film', 'results', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'Harold', 'Maud', 'Harold', 'father', 'are', 'exceptional', 'make', 'film', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'tensions', 'Harold', 'Maud', 'Harold', 'mother', 'Ruth', 'Gordon', 'such', 'fine', 'actress', 'film', 'soar', 'approach', 'eccentric', 'character', 'warm', 'life', 'affirming', 'Bud', 'Cort', 'superb', 'Harold', 'looking', '17', 'years', 'old', 'film', 'Vivian', 'Pickles', 'also', 'superb', 'Harold', 'mother', 'Maud', 'mentor', 'muse', 'somber', 'Harold', 'adventure', 'adventure', 'life', 'experiences', 'one', 'scene', 'Maud', 'wisdom', 'When', 'being', 'taken', 'emergency', 'room', 'stretcher', 'Harold', 'Maud', 'love', 'Maud', 'lovingly', 'serenely', 'answers', 'wonderful', 'Harold', 'now', 'go', 'out', 'love', 'more', 'simplicity', 'truth', 'short', 'exchange', 'struck', 'heart', 'film', 'totally', 'life', 'affirming', 'dark', 'humor', 'make', 'more', 'film', 'fun', 'fashion', 'times', 'fact', 'was', 'made', '1971', 'not', 'date', 'film', 'rather', 'more', 'sly', 'commentary', 'hair', 'jewelry', 'clothes', 'cars', 'period', 'Cat', 'Steven', 'soundtrack', 'joyful', 'perfect', 'compliment', '1970', 'feel', 'movie', 'themes.The', 'film', 'now', 'almost', '40', 'years', 'old', 'become', 'American', 'classic', 'primarily', 'themes', 'explored', 'tensions', 'push', 'pull', 'desire', 'live', 'desire', 'give', 'up', 'are', 'so', 'perfectly', 'portrayed', 'film']",N/A

Harold is a privileged teenager from a wealthy, well-connected family who also is extremely lonely and has an extraordinarily morbid fascination with death and suicide.  Maude is the cheerful, free-spirited 79-year-old woman who lives alone in a trailer and gets Harold to lighten up and enjoy life.Even though it would appear at face value that these two have nothing in common, they find a common bond in the fact that both of them are oddballs who don't quite fit into their surroundings.  Although their falling in love is strange, it is touching to see Harold--a sullen, hearse-driving kid who is almost completely alienated from the outside world--finally connect with someone who both understands and truly cares about him.  Needless to say, their budding romance doesn't exactly tickle the fancy of Harold's parents--especially his cold, distant mother.While ""Harold and Maude"" is a story that is eccentric and quirky enough to interest moviegoers today who perhaps don't want the standard Hollywood schlock, it should be noted that certain aspects of this movie are a little dated:  namely, Cat Stevens' songs (catchy and appropriate, but cheesy) and Harold's visit to his comically disabled uncle in the U.S. Army, which devolves into a rather naive anti-war statement that was unfortunately common during this particular period in American history.No matter, ""Harold and Maude"" is great entertainment, and if you're looking for a movie that's a little off the beaten path, try this little gem from Hal Ashby.

A love story like no other, an inspired lesson in self-awareness and fearlessness in self-expression - this may fall into the ""cult"" department, but should be seen by all.Unfortunately, the extreme May-December romance of Harold and Maude raises eyebrows to the point that many see only this aspect of the film - ""Oh my God he slept with an 80-year-old woman oh my God"" - but in actuality, this has so little to do with the film's message.  It points out that love comes in all shapes and sizes, and most often when we least expect it.  Also, that a friend of any age can open us to seeing the world in a new, more truthful light.  Harold begins as an introverted, unhappy young man, whose only creative outlet consists of tormenting his image-obsessed, utter snob of a mother (thus forming the most hilarious visuals for the viewer).  After meeting with Maude, his world rapidly opens to new discoveries, and a greater understanding of his fellow human beings.  If you have any kind of heart, the final sexual union (relax, folks - we don't see the details) between Harold and Maude doesn't offend - rather, it warms the heart and soul.The DVD offers a few treats - theatrical trailers, and, well, a great print.

Director Hal Ashby was coming off the critical success of ""The Landlord"".  Colin Higgins would later write the Seventies Hitchcockian comic classics ""Silver Streak"" and ""Foul Play"".  Bud Cort was coming off starring in Robert Altman's askewed dark comic classic ""Brewster McCloud"".  Ruth Gordon was adding another character to her gallery of off-the-wall geriatrics.  In order for ""Harold and Maude"" to succeed you have to believe in the central conceit of a twenty year old man with a death fixation mutually falling in love with an eighty year old free spirit otherwise it's a cynical exercise.  These are not stereotypes but fully realized characters.  One would have to note that Harold's staged suicides are probably more a cry for love than for attention.  One would also have to notice the markings on Maude's arm probably the result of German atrocities.  Not once do you disbelieve this relationship.  Not in the performances of Cort and Gordon or in Ashby's direction or in the script.  If you followed Ashby's career his films celebrate iconoclasm and he could be viewed as something of a maverick himself by making very personal films that through some act of God were green lighted by the studios.  Good supporting turns by Vivian Pickles as Harold's frustrated mother, G. Wood, an Altman vet, as Harold's psychiatrist, Charles Tyner as Harold's militaristic uncle, Eric Christmas as a priest disgusted by Harold and Maude's relationship, and Judy Geer as an actress Harold's mother tries to fix him up with.  I failed to mention the terrific song score offered by Cat Stevens which includes the beautiful ""If You Want To Be Free, Be Free"" as something of a signature theme for the two lovers.  Oddly, at the time of the film's release they didn't issue a soundtrack album.  It's only available on an out-of-print vinyl issue that came out some years after the film's release which also includes Gordon's version of the aforementioned song and the price is quite steep for even a second hand copy. Is it no wonder that a film that flopped both critically and commercially at the time of initial release has endeared itself to audiences forty years later?  I last saw this film when I was sixteen on a double feature with ""The King of Hearts"" which is currently discontinued on DVD.  Are you listening, Criterion?  I didn't appreciate the subtleties of the film at the time because of my youth and my inexperience in the ways of love but thirty-four years on I am touched by its resonance and poignancy.",5,Bud Cort-Future Bond Company Stooge,1375574400,"08 4, 2013",2013,2616,"['Were', ""n't"", 'Seventies', 'great', ""n't"", 'often', 'stars', 'align', 'just', 'right', 'create', 'movie', 'magic', 'Director', 'Hal', 'Ashby', 'was', 'coming', 'off', 'critical', 'success', 'Landlord', 'Colin', 'Higgins', 'would', 'later', 'write', 'Seventies', 'Hitchcockian', 'comic', 'classics', 'Silver', 'Streak', 'Foul', 'Play', 'Bud', 'Cort', 'was', 'coming', 'off', 'starring', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'askewed', 'dark', 'comic', 'classic', 'Brewster', 'McCloud', 'Ruth', 'Gordon', 'was', 'adding', 'character', 'gallery', 'off-the-wall', 'geriatrics', 'order', 'Harold', 'Maude', 'succeed', 'have', 'believe', 'central', 'conceit', 'twenty', 'year', 'old', 'man', 'death', 'fixation', 'mutually', 'falling', 'love', 'eighty', 'year', 'old', 'free', 'spirit', 'cynical', 'exercise', 'are', 'not', 'stereotypes', 'fully', 'realized', 'characters', 'One', 'would', 'have', 'note', 'Harold', 'staged', 'suicides', 'are', 'probably', 'more', 'cry', 'love', 'attention', 'One', 'would', 'also', 'have', 'notice', 'markings', 'Maude', 'arm', 'probably', 'result', 'German', 'atrocities', 'Not', 'once', 'do', 'disbelieve', 'relationship', 'Not', 'performances', 'Cort', 'Gordon', 'Ashby', 'direction', 'script', 'followed', 'Ashby', 'career', 'films', 'celebrate', 'iconoclasm', 'could', 'be', 'viewed', 'something', 'maverick', 'making', 'very', 'personal', 'films', 'act', 'God', 'were', 'green', 'lighted', 'studios', 'Good', 'supporting', 'turns', 'Vivian', 'Pickles', 'Harold', 'frustrated', 'mother', 'G.', 'Wood', 'Altman', 'vet', 'Harold', 'psychiatrist', 'Charles', 'Tyner', 'Harold', 'militaristic', 'uncle', 'Eric', 'Christmas', 'priest', 'disgusted', 'Harold', 'Maude', 'relationship', 'Judy', 'Geer', 'actress', 'Harold', 'mother', 'fix', 'up', 'failed', 'mention', 'terrific', 'song', 'score', 'offered', 'Cat', 'Stevens', 'beautiful', 'Want', 'Be', 'Free', 'Be', 'Free', 'something', 'signature', 'theme', 'two', 'lovers', 'Oddly', 'time', 'film', 'release', 'did', ""n't"", 'issue', 'soundtrack', 'album', 'only', 'available', 'out-of-print', 'vinyl', 'issue', 'came', 'out', 'years', 'film', 'release', 'also', 'Gordon', 'version', 'aforementioned', 'song', 'price', 'quite', 'steep', 'even', 'second', 'hand', 'copy', 'wonder', 'film', 'flopped', 'critically', 'commercially', 'time', 'initial', 'release', 'endeared', 'audiences', 'forty', 'years', 'later', 'last', 'saw', 'film', 'when', 'was', 'sixteen', 'double', 'feature', 'King', 'Hearts', 'currently', 'discontinued', 'DVD', 'Are', 'listening', 'Criterion', 'did', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'subtleties', 'film', 'time', 'youth', 'inexperience', 'ways', 'love', 'thirty-four', 'years', 'am', 'touched', 'resonance', 'poignancy']",N/A

220595,A2IHIKHWCDB0FG,6300216268,Dexter Manning,"[1, 1]","THE FILM: 5 Stars""Harold and Maude,"" a film from the early-1970s which started humbly but grew to become a cult classic from one of Hollywood's golden ages, can be classified as many things: a comedy that runs both dark and light, a romance that is at once offbeat and charming, a satire about society, class, and politics, a clich&eacute;-buster about nonconformity, and, finally, a movie that takes any preconceptions you may have and tosses them away.Directed by Hal Ashby from a screenplay written by Colin Higgins, the focus of the story is a wealthy, quiet, and profoundly morose young man named Harold Chasen (played by turns serious and sincere, deadpan and charmed by Bud Cort, in perhaps his best-remembered performance), who is absorbed with the notion of death--specifically his own. He is so obsessed with it that, when he is not attending the funerals of people he never knew, for his own ""special sense of satisfaction,"" he feigns suicide. He pretend-kills or -maims himself numerous times during the film, in fact. So many times that it seems to be, for him, a recreational sport, a bleak hobby of sorts. Rather than the dashing Jaguar he could easily acquire, his preference is for the black hearse, which, as you may have rightly deduced already, he drives to those funerals he is so fond of.His morbid episodes are rather imaginative (it turns out there are many, many techniques a man can use to harm himself, and Harold, apparently, is a master of most of them, at least as far as dress rehearsals) but, above all, a theatrical spectacle performed especially for an audience of just one: his mother. But, his antics, no matter how showy they may be, are little-appreciated by Mrs Chasen, a fashionable and humorously conceited society lady (relishingly portrayed, with her upper-crust English accent and her metaphorical nose held too high, by the British theater actress Vivian Pickles) who, half the time, is annoyed with her son's devious pleas for attention and, the remainder of the time, hardly registers them in the midst of her need to entertain her well-heeled guests or live her life of entitlement in her sprawling estate. We learn that Harold's behavior stems largely from his mother being too distant. Yet, one senses that seemingly unbridgable gap between them widening with each ""deadly"" incident. If all of this sounds too heavy, don't worry. This movie is, without doubt, a comedy; Harold's incidents and the reactions of his mother and her occasional company to them--shocked, irritated, resigned or, simply, preoccupied--are quite funny. And many of them happen abruptly, with no warning, thus surprising the audience as well.Enter Maude, who, like Harold, enjoys visiting funerals and, indeed, befriends him at one. But, far from sharing Harold's bleak outlook on life, Maude uses them as one more excuse to live life to its fullest. Amidst a crowd of people who mourn in their near-uniform sea of black garments and umbrellas, she stands out, with her yellow umbrella, a small sign of her vivacious, carefree soul.After they spot each other, their relationship builds relatively slowly. She makes the first moves, taking the trouble to close in on him mid-ceremony, in the church, to offer him, of all things, licorice. They gradually talk more and more. He's rather timid at first but she is so flirtatious and free-spirited that the shy Harold soon begins a slow emergence from his shell. Before long, he's driving her around in his hearse (which she has just stolen--not that it really bothers anyone; everyone has their little quirks, right?), to her home, an old roadside rail car, bursting with plants, music, bric-a-brac, art, scents that smell like snow in New York, and a sculpture Harold finds particularly intriguing as he falls for her, this woman of spontaneity who acts as a counterweight against his feelings of mortality, with those of life. Just as he dwells on death and knows a hundred ways to find it, she finds life and its inspiration in seemingly everything and every place, some of them unexpected. A greenhouse filled with white dasies that look the same at first glance but, on closer inspection, are each different from the next. A cemetary filled with row upon row of identical white headstones. A scrawny tree clinging to life on the side of a city road--they unearth it and whisk it to the forest, where it can thrive. They find amusement and, thus, life at upstaging Harold's uncle, a military man who was General MacArthur's ""right-hand man,""--and lost his own, with its arm, at some point during his long career. He salutes, when he is so moved, by pulling a string that extends the sleeve of his phantom arm into the air. And, of course, they still partake in more conventional dates. An outing to an amusement park reveals how completely smitten they are with each other. Harold surprises Maude with cake, champaigne, and more on her eightieth birthday.Oh, did I forget to mention her age? It's actually the detail about Harold and Maude's relationship that most would find unconventional, moreso than the sharp contrast in their respective outlooks on life (and death). At least that's what the film seems to think. Indeed, it is unusual to mainstream Americans, but certainly not unheard of. The history of films and that of many of their makers, not to mention the populace at large, are peppered with similar stories. What truly makes ""Harold and Maude"" interesting, fun, and refreshing even after all these years is it takes a seemingly odd arrangement and stretches it to its extreme ends (an age difference that almost couldn't be greater, virtually no inhibitions), more than other films did before and since, without sheepishness or apology. It asserts that people must not have their choice of life partner, a most personal and intimate decision, dictated or judged by society merely to conform to the generally accepted ""norms"" or other such rules. Fortunately, it seems that a great deal more people have, by and large, accepted this most reasonable of philosophies, though we still have a long way to go.Harold's older and, in some ways, wiser significant other is marvelously portrayed by Ruth Gordon, the Academy Award-winning actress (""Rosemary's Baby""), in one of her signature screen roles, and she does anything but ""act her age."" Every so often, for instance, she still models in the nude, with obvious pleasure and an utter lack of hesitation, for her ice-sculptor friend, Glaucus (Cyril Cusack). If only we could all be as uninhibited and full of vigor after eight decades.Meanwhile, Harold's mother--though I'm inclined to refer to her more formally as Mrs Chasen, so tersely formal, comically self-centered and oblivious to him is she that one almost doubts they are truly related--unaware of her son's exploits with a woman who is old enough to be Mrs Chasen's own mother, does everything she can think of to make him, if not more ""normal,"" then, at least, less of an embarrassment to her. She does what, perhaps, most parents would do with their wayward teenaged kids. For starters, she tries the obvious fix and has him see a psychiatrist (a somewhat baffled G. Wood). Stepping up the pressure, she then sends him to his uncle, the aforementioned right-sleeve-saluting General Victor Ball (a boisterous Charles Tyner) of the U.S. Army, into whose ranks Harold is drafted.But the main endeavor Mrs Chasen pursues to set her boy on what she feels is the proper path to manhood is to arrange a series of blind dates with the intention that he will ultimately marry one of them. The scene in which they answer the computer dating service's questionnaire--rather, she answers it for him--is one of the funniest and memorable in the film. The result is three more or less conventional women (Judy Engles, Shari Summers, and Ellen Geer) who each arrive at the Chasen mansion, in turn, as the film progresses, for a date that is cut too short and ends basically the same as the others, all to humorous effect, the last date easily the most inspired by Harold's weird nature but, in the end, no match for him. Another character steeped in convention who we meet briefly is the priest (an often shocked Eric Christmas) who gives the sermons at the funerals Harold and Maude attend. Among all the reactions to the news of Harold and Maude's devotion to each other, his is the most hilarious.The overall feel of the film swings between moody (any of Harold's ""little eccentric moments,"" as Mrs Chasen prefers to refer to them) and freewheeling (the title couple's encounters with police officers), but always with a comic sensibility. The director of photography, John Alonzo, helps create mood with the dim spaces and subdued colors of the mansion's interiors, to light-filled scenes with Maude. The film editing by William A. Sawyer and Edward Warschilka, is frequently imaginative, particularly in the cuts between scenes, such as the cut from Harold practicing his music at Maude's place to him doing the same outside his mansion, or a scene-transition cut that involves Harold opening the doors of his hearse. This type of editing, in its subtle ways, helps drive the continuity of the story.Beyond that, one of the most clever and effective devices used in the film is the soundtrack, comprised mainly of original songs performed by Cat Stevens. It's not only that the simple yet catchy numbers, accompanied chiefly by piano and guitar, would make a memorable experience all by themselves. It is also the fact that the songs provide something of a window into Harold's mind, clarifying what he feels at particular moments of importance. Ashby, known as a director who uses music to powerful effect (see ""Being There""), also includes a brief rendition of Tchaikovsky's classical ""Coronation March,"" used well in relation to this film.But, overall the tone of the film is chiefly due, of course, to Ashby's masterful direction, Higgins' brilliant screenplay, and the performances, especially those of Gordon and Cort, at the center of it all. She seems the very definition of free-spiritedness and vitality, as well as the teacher of life. He portrays an old boy who does not realize, at first, how conflicted and lost he is, then proceeds, with the help of a certain young-at-heart lady, to change before our eyes, truly, finally maturing into a young man who irresistably finds life--his life. And that's an experience that we all should find irresistable.THE DISC: 1-1/2 StarsThis title is one of the numerous examples of outstanding films being slighted by a poor home entertainment release. The disc is characterized by the usual fallacies of such an issue: a too-soft picture quality composed of faded colors; muffled sound that is not as clear as it should be; and no special features, save for a couple of the film's trailers. Not even a commentary. As is generally the case for films originally made with mono sound (like ""Harold and Maude""), the Dolby 5.1 stereo sound adds little to the overall experience. One good feature is the fact that it is designed for the widescreen televisions that have become standard (though that alone surely does not save this disc).It seems Paramount Pictures, the studio behind both the original theatrical release and the home entertainment prints, was determined to invest as little as possible toward bringing one of its classic films of the seventies to disc. I don't wish to actively begrudge Paramount any more than it deserves. Most of the studios are guilty of the same lackluster treatment for certain movies in their own respective libraries. However, it seems Paramount has done this far more frequently than the others, including to many of its best-known films. One hopes that the studio will use the advent of high-definition (i.e., Blu-ray discs), as a reason to finally give the films in its catalog, including ""Harold and Maude,"" a long-awaited home entertainment overhaul, complete with sharp and rich visuals, crystal clear sound, and loads of informative and entertaining special features.The trailers are amusing. The first one seems to be more of a teaser, chiefly showing a few snippets from the film while Cat Stevens sings the lyrics to what could easily be considered the main theme song to the film: ""If you want to sing out, sing out / And, if you want to be free, be free / Cause there's a million ways to be / You know that there are..."" The second trailer gives a better sense of the film's premise, portraying more of the supporting characters and including more dialogue (plus, if you pay close attention, you'll notice a few shots that are not actually in the final film). It also, however, is one of those trailers (and many movies have these) that gives away too much of the story, showing glimpses of virtually all of Harold's ""suicides"" and certain situations that, for dramatic purposes, should have been left for audiences to discover themselves.",5,Harold and Maude: A Review.

(and for the true film lovers, you may just dig it!)In 1970, I was 12 years old and living in the ocean side of the 'Fairway District' in Pacifica, California.Whilst waiting one Winter's morn for the school bus to take several of my classmates and your humble narrator off to my 7th-Grade school -- I spied many production trucks up on the hill.  Chief amongst the vehicles up there, was a strange-looking Jaguar.This was 'HAROLD'S' Jag that roared off the cliff in the last scene.Rather than getting on the school bus when it ultimately arrived -- I took off and went closer to the dirt road.  At the entrance to the dirt road, I asked one of the production crew the name of the movie -- (likely a 'production assistant' as he was tired and wired young and had a walkie-talkie strapped to his belt) -- and he replied 'HAROLD & MAUDE' ...Well, I would go on in the years to come to being a 'production assistant' myself on many films and worked my way up the production food chain to a produced screenwriter and commercial director with 600 spots and tons of awards.In short ------ one of the films I was a production assistant on in the mid 1980's was 'FREE SPIRIT' that ultimately was released as 'MAXIE' (Glenn Close, Mandy Patinkin -- and Paul Arron was the Director).  And guess who was in the cast as the wacky, ball of energy, 70-something neighbor?  Bingo, you got it in one -- RUTH GORDON!In all of the San Francisco scenes on 'Maxie', I was detailed to make sure Ruth got to the set from her hotel, had anything she wanted, etc.  One day I told her about seeing the 'HAROLD & MAUDE' up on the hill above my housing tract when I was 12.

220600,A2UUWETDYA2EKV,6300216268,Douglas Doepke,"[7, 7]","Harold and Maude is neither the cinema's greatest movie, nor is it the worst. Instead, it is a highly original, quirky black comedy that combines inventive characters  with a devastating attack on the pillars of America's Establishment. It's no accident that Harold comes from a conformist upper-class family, over which mom presides lavishly, but like a petty demeaning tyrant. Nor is it happenstance that Maude's origins lie outside a youthful US, in an older, more experienced Europe devastated by the death-dealing Holocaust of which she is a survivor. Hers is understood as a life-affirming perspective that has been earned, and stands as the perfect antidote to the zombified Harold, whose soul has shriveled in the midst of repressive norms and repressed instincts. Probably no movie from that rebellious era captures the counter-culture's positive image of itself better than this one. Nor are the forces in conflict more sharply and humorously drawn than the encounters with organized religion, psychiatry, the military, and other of America's domineering institutions. Even at age 80, Maude represents the pure flower child riposte, showing that age is no barrier to affirmative values, while Harold overcomes alienation by at last responding to enlivening people rather than deadening duties.

220601,A3HM5G9IV1FTFP,6300216268,Douglas King,"[2, 2]","""Harold and Maude"" is not really a love story in the conventional romantic sense. It's more of a story about how one person can change another person's life just by being themself. Harold is a wealthy, bored, morose young man who gets his kicks by attending funerals of people he doesn't know and staging elaborate, fake suicides to rattle his mother. At one funeral he happens to meet Maude, another ""funeral crasher"". Maude, about to turn 80, is starting to wonder if her own death shouldn't be coming soon. The two quickly embark on a friendship (and, yes, even sexual relationship) which completely changes Harold's views on life. Maude is one of the greatest characters I've ever seen portrayed on film. At the same time daring and sensitive, childlike and wise, rebellious and spiritual, Maude is an elderly iconoclast whose fierce love of life has inspired her to free herself of almost all of society's restrictions. Frankly, she's my hero. At times touching, funny, inspiring and strange, ""Harold and Maude"" is one of my favorite films of all time.",5,Maude is my hero,1075420800,"01 30, 2004",2004,1057,"['Harold', 'Maude', 'not', 'really', 'love', 'story', 'conventional', 'romantic', 'sense', 'more', 'story', 'how', 'one', 'person', 'can', 'change', 'person', 'life', 'just', 'being', 'Harold', 'wealthy', 'bored', 'morose', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'kicks', 'attending', 'funerals', 'people', ""n't"", 'know', 'staging', 'elaborate', 'fake', 'suicides', 'rattle', 'mother', 'one', 'funeral', 'meet', 'Maude', 'funeral', 'crasher', 'Maude', 'turn', '80', 'starting', 'wonder', 'own', 'death', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'coming', 'soon', 'two', 'quickly', 'embark', 'friendship', 'yes', 'even', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'completely', 'Harold', 'views', 'life', 'Maude', 'one', 'greatest', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'portrayed', 'film', 'same', 'time', 'daring', 'sensitive', 'childlike', 'wise', 'rebellious', 'spiritual', 'Maude', 'elderly', 'iconoclast', 'fierce', 'love', 'life', 'inspired', 'free', 'herself', 'almost', 'society', 'restrictions', 'Frankly', 'hero', 'times', 'touching', 'funny', 'inspiring', 'strange', 'Harold', 'Maude', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'time']",N/A
220602,ADS5APY1NKTL4,6300216268,"D. Pawl ""Dani""","[8, 8]","HAROLD AND MAUDE is truly a cult classic, and, rightfully so!  This is a film about learning to embrace life, find the joy in the little things, and not take a moment for granted.  It is also a dark comedy about two misfits who find friendship and love in the company of one another.Harold (Bud Cort), is best described as an ""odd young man"" with a constant preoccupation with death.  He is constantly faking his own death to get the attention of his blase and inattentive mother (Vivian Pickles).  Her response is often one of boredom, and wearily attempts to fix him up with women through a computer dating service.  The wealthy young man spends his time attending the funerals of strangers, cruising around in his very own hearse.  It's one fateful day that he has a chance encounter with the fiesty, plucky, flamboyantly irreverant Maude (Ruth Gordon).  This woman is truly like no woman he could ever meet through the computer dating service.  Together, they embark on a lifechanging friendship.  She teaches him to embrace life, challenge authority and awakens his spirit to the world around him.Although, this film was quite a scandal, when it came out, due in no small part to the depiction of a romantic relationship between a young man and a woman old enough to be his grandmother, don't judge the book by its cover.  Truthfully, Maude has more life in her than women 1/3 her age, and Bud Cort's portrayal of Harold gives new meaning to the term ""goth.""  Not only does the story have some priceless scenes (particularly, when Harold fakes his own death in front of the young women his mother attempts to set him up with), but it is touching and, ultimately heartwrenching.  What's more, the soundtrack by Cat Stevens is fantastic!

220607,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,6300216268,Ed Uyeshima,"[3, 3]","This 1971 black comedy is still a stitch, even if it doesn't feel as audacious as I'm sure it once did. Directed by the maverick Hal Ashby, it is the epitome of all opposites-attract love stories as a twenty-year old depressive connects with a 79-year old life-loving woman. They actually bond over their mutual interest in death, as they keep showing up at the same funerals. However, the root of their respective interests couldn't be more different - Maude shows up to reconfirm how lucky she feels to be alive, while the hearse-driving Harold simply likes the morbidity of it all.The plot is really about their burgeoning relationship, while his mother constantly attempts to make the death-obsessed Harold more socially acceptable. First, she uselessly sets him up on a series of blind dates. To foil any hope of romance with these women, however, he stages mock-suicides which simply perturbs rather than disturbs his mother. She then recruits an ineffectual analyst and even has her brother Victor, a hawkish officer and Vietnam War amputee, to try to convince Harold to join the Army. The episodic structure of the story by Collin Higgins (years before becoming a director in his own right with ""Foul Play"" and ""Nine to Five"") allows the characters to develop in subtle ways with a completely deadpan approach despite the outward shenanigans of the characters' actions. The movie eventually moves toward a greater gravitas but despite some soap opera elements, surprisingly not at the expense of the pervasive whimsical tone.Ruth Gordon is her typically pixilated self, an archetype she played for years afterward, while Bud Cort is terrific in conveying his particular brand of wide-eyed cynicism. It's really their unforced chemistry that keeps the film feeling fresh 35 years later. There are funny sideline performances by Vivian Pickles as Harold's eye-rolling mother, Ellen Geer as an overly actressy blind date named Sunshine, and Eric Christmas in a very funny cameo as a disapproving priest. Cat Stevens' soundtrack hasn't aged as well as, say, Simon and Garfunkel's music in ""The Graduate"", but it still works as a folkish commentary on the quirky proceedings.

She borrows, 'steals' other's cars, attends funerals of unknown people, rescues 'asthmatic' trees and saves Harold.  Harold, Bud Cort, is a young man in search of his place in the big wide world.  He is at odds with his mother and really is adrift..without any real direction.  For attention and to rattle his mother, he fakes suicides and attends funerals.  There he meets Maude and she starts to bring him out of the his shell...she helps him learn to sing his own song.  This is a theme that is played upon as she gives harold the banjo.  His mother tries to get him to figure out what he wants by having him talk with a psychiatrist, (notice how he and harold wear the same clothes), his Uncle..the war veteran..and by getting him married off.This movie has some genuine funny moments.  The scene of his mother filling out the computer dating questionarie is hillarious.  When he fakes setting himself on fire and his date goes into hysterics..running off.  He faces the camera with that wry smirk..his mother looking at him with furrowed brow..and he turns to see her expression and quickly loses that smirk..is just fine acting and an interesting film technique.  The part where Maude sees the sick tree and turns quickly and parks on the sidewalk.. with car running and doors open..to try to move the tree and returns to the car as the three policeman are checking out the situation.  She ask the officer if the car over there is parked right. He replies yes..as the officers look at each other laughingly.  Harold and Maude steal the Mach 1 and race around the corner..squeeling tires not even stopping.  The expression on the waving policeman's face is priceless.There are just way too many really..fall out of the chair..funny parts in this movie to mention.

220614,A2BPDFR58H9575,6300216268,Galina,"[1, 1]","""Harold and Maude"" is a delightful, funny, moving, off-beat black comedy with a lot of heart. It is also one of the best and unusual on-screen romances I've seen. If the opposites attract each other, there have not been perhaps more different in every possible way screen couple than 20 years old Harold (Bud Cort) and Maude(charming, clever, multi-talented Ruth Gordon, the Oscar winning actress and three times Oscar nominee for writing) who is just about to turn 80. Harold is a rich kid who is obsessed with death and likes to stage very believable and hilarious succession of suicide attempts to impress his unflappable socialite mother who got used to them and not impressed anymore. Harold's others hobbies are driving the hearse and to attend funerals where he meets one day a woman who will change his life forever, 79 years young free-spirit, rebel, and fighter for ""Liberty. Rights. Justice"", Maude. She also likes to attend the funerals of the strangers. We won't learn much about Maude's life story but there will be one visual flash which gives us a very good idea that Maude knew a lot about death, losses, and suffering but she chose to celebrate, worship, and enjoy life to the fullest. This short poignant moment is a stroke of genius, and there are many of them in the truly unique, one of its kind movie. Maybe Hal Ashby had brought some of memories from his own childhood that included the divorce of his parents, his father's suicide, his dropping out of high school, getting married and divorced all before he was 19, into ""Harold and Maude"". Hal Ashby had made a series of memorable, intelligent, well acted films in the 70s, that included The Last Detail (1973), Shampoo (1975), Bound for Glory (1976), Coming Home (1978) and Being There (1979) but it is ""Harold and Maude"" that has become the cult classic from the first days of its release and it more than deserves its status. The movie also benefits tremendously from the soundtrack of songs by Cat Stevens.",5,"""Harold loves Maude.""... and Maude loves Harold",1207958400,"04 12, 2008",2008,1986,"['Harold', 'Maude', 'delightful', 'funny', 'moving', 'off-beat', 'black', 'comedy', 'lot', 'heart', 'also', 'one', 'best', 'unusual', 'on-screen', 'romances', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'opposites', 'attract', 'other', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'perhaps', 'more', 'different', 'possible', 'way', 'screen', 'couple', '20', 'years', 'old', 'Harold', 'Bud', 'Cort', 'Maude', 'charming', 'clever', 'multi-talented', 'Ruth', 'Gordon', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'actress', 'three', 'times', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'writing', 'who', 'just', 'turn', '80', 'Harold', 'rich', 'kid', 'who', 'obsessed', 'death', 'likes', 'stage', 'very', 'believable', 'hilarious', 'succession', 'suicide', 'attempts', 'impress', 'unflappable', 'socialite', 'mother', 'who', 'got', 'used', 'not', 'impressed', 'anymore', 'Harold', 'others', 'hobbies', 'are', 'driving', 'hearse', 'attend', 'funerals', 'where', 'one', 'day', 'woman', 'who', 'will', 'change', 'life', 'forever', '79', 'years', 'young', 'free-spirit', 'rebel', 'fighter', 'Liberty', 'Rights', 'Justice', 'Maude', 'also', 'attend', 'funerals', 'strangers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'learn', 'much', 'Maude', 'life', 'story', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'visual', 'flash', 'very', 'good', 'idea', 'Maude', 'knew', 'lot', 'death', 'losses', 'suffering', 'chose', 'celebrate', 'worship', 'enjoy', 'life', 'fullest', 'short', 'poignant', 'moment', 'stroke', 'genius', 'are', 'many', 'truly', 'unique', 'one', 'kind', 'movie', 'Maybe', 'Hal', 'Ashby', 'had', 'brought', 'memories', 'own', 'childhood', 'included', 'divorce', 'parents', 'father', 'suicide', 'dropping', 'high', 'school', 'getting', 'married', 'divorced', 'was', '19', 'Harold', 'Maude', 'Hal', 'Ashby', 'had', 'made', 'series', 'memorable', 'intelligent', 'well', 'acted', 'films', '70s', 'included', 'Last', 'Detail', '1973', 'Shampoo', '1975', 'Bound', 'Glory', '1976', 'Coming', 'Home', '1978', 'Being', '1979', 'Harold', 'Maude', 'become', 'cult', 'classic', 'first', 'days', 'release', 'more', 'status', 'movie', 'also', 'benefits', 'tremendously', 'soundtrack', 'songs', 'Cat', 'Stevens']",N/A
220615,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,6300216268,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[1, 1]","Although it had its supporters, most critics viciously attacked the 1971 HAROLD AND MAUDE.  Vincent Carnaby, influential critic for The New York Times, described it as ""creepy and off-putting;"" Variety was equally dire, saying it ""has all the fun and gaiety of a burning orphanage.""  The public was vocally appalled by the marketing, which presented movie as a love story between an old woman and a teenage boy, and stayed away.  It was one of the biggest crash-and-burn debacles of its decade.  And more than twenty years later it was placed in the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress as artistically, culturally, and historically significant.  It seems fairly safe to say that it was movie twenty-five years ahead of its time.The basic outline of the story is extremely well known.  Harold (Bud Cort) is nineteen, and heir to a family fortune, and entirely under the thumb of his relentlessly proper mother (Vivian Pickles.)  Disillusioned, disgruntled, and desperate for attention, he attempts to torture his mother by faking on suicide after another; he also buys a hearse and begins to attend the fuenrals of people he does not know.  It is here that he meets Maude (Ruth Gordon), a seventy-nine year old woman who every bit as eccentric but in an entirely opposite way: instead of embracing death, she embraces life, determined to have a good time--even if it means throwing caution to the winds and flying in the face of all that is considered ""appropriate behavior.""The outline of the story doesn't do it justice.  Although the humor of the film arises from relentless irreverence, its power arises from Maude's determination that Harold should at least try living before he so firmly embraces death--a choice that she herself has secretly made, electing to end her life before she becomes a victim of old age.  Maude teaches Harold to take chances, to fight the good fight and not count the cost.  Yes, HAROLD AND MAUDE really is as wild, wacky, far-out, and off-beat as you may have heard.  But it is a great deal more than that.  It is also a lesson in living without undue respect for the prisons of conventionality.It is impossible to imagine the film working without Ruth Gordon and But Court, who make the entire thing--all the way from faked suicides to stolen cars--seem entirely plausible, and who offer a depth of character that might have escaped other actors.  Vivian Pickles also scores strongly as Harold's controlling mother; the entire supporting cast is equally fine.  Harold Ashby, who also directed such later films as SHAMPOO, leads the material with a sure touch and quick pace; cinematographer John Alonzo films everything with an attractive touch.  And any review that failed to mention the Cat Stevens score, which has the effect of tying the various episodes so firmly together, would be horrendously amiss.Although the film could stand a remaster, my only serious complaint about the DVD release is that this is indeed a film that deserves a release with all the bells and whistles--but there isn't a single bonus to be had.  Not everyone will like HAROLD AND MAUDE.  Many continue to agree that the film is indeed ""creepy and off-putting""--and in a world where conformity is over-valued, they always will.  But forget such small-minded hobgoblins: HAROLD AND MAUDE is both wickedly funny and deeply touching, and I strongly recommend it.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",5,"""You can't let the world judge you too much.""",1231804800,"01 13, 2009",2009,3407,"['had', 'supporters', 'most', 'critics', 'viciously', 'attacked', '1971', 'HAROLD', 'AND', 'MAUDE', 'Vincent', 'Carnaby', 'influential', 'critic', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'described', 'creepy', 'off-putting', 'Variety', 'was', 'equally', 'dire', 'saying', 'fun', 'gaiety', 'burning', 'orphanage', 'public', 'was', 'vocally', 'appalled', 'marketing', 'presented', 'movie', 'love', 'story', 'old', 'woman', 'teenage', 'boy', 'stayed', 'away', 'was', 'one', 'biggest', 'crash-and-burn', 'debacles', 'decade', 'more', 'twenty', 'years', 'later', 'was', 'placed', 'National', 'Film', 'Registry', 'Library', 'Congress', 'artistically', 'culturally', 'historically', 'significant', 'fairly', 'safe', 'say', 'was', 'movie', 'twenty-five', 'years', 'ahead', 'time.The', 'basic', 'outline', 'story', 'extremely', 'well', 'known', 'Harold', 'Bud', 'Cort', 'nineteen', 'heir', 'family', 'fortune', 'entirely', 'thumb', 'relentlessly', 'mother', 'Vivian', 'Pickles', 'Disillusioned', 'disgruntled', 'desperate', 'attention', 'torture', 'mother', 'faking', 'suicide', 'also', 'hearse', 'attend', 'fuenrals', 'people', 'not', 'know', 'here', 'Maude', 'Ruth', 'Gordon', 'seventy-nine', 'year', 'old', 'woman', 'who', 'bit', 'eccentric', 'entirely', 'opposite', 'way', 'instead', 'embracing', 'death', 'life', 'determined', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'even', 'throwing', 'caution', 'winds', 'flying', 'face', 'considered', 'appropriate', 'behavior', 'outline', 'story', ""n't"", 'do', 'justice', 'humor', 'film', 'relentless', 'irreverence', 'power', 'arises', 'Maude', 'determination', 'Harold', 'should', 'least', 'try', 'living', 'so', 'firmly', 'death', 'choice', 'secretly', 'made', 'electing', 'end', 'life', 'victim', 'old', 'age', 'Maude', 'teaches', 'Harold', 'take', 'chances', 'fight', 'good', 'fight', 'not', 'count', 'cost', 'Yes', 'HAROLD', 'AND', 'MAUDE', 'really', 'wild', 'wacky', 'far-out', 'off-beat', 'may', 'have', 'heard', 'great', 'deal', 'more', 'also', 'lesson', 'living', 'undue', 'respect', 'prisons', 'conventionality.It', 'impossible', 'imagine', 'film', 'working', 'Ruth', 'Gordon', 'Court', 'who', 'make', 'entire', 'thing', 'way', 'faked', 'suicides', 'stolen', 'cars', 'seem', 'entirely', 'plausible', 'who', 'offer', 'depth', 'character', 'might', 'have', 'escaped', 'other', 'actors', 'Vivian', 'Pickles', 'also', 'strongly', 'Harold', 'controlling', 'mother', 'entire', 'supporting', 'cast', 'equally', 'fine', 'Harold', 'Ashby', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'such', 'later', 'films', 'SHAMPOO', 'material', 'sure', 'touch', 'quick', 'pace', 'John', 'Alonzo', 'films', 'everything', 'attractive', 'touch', 'review', 'failed', 'mention', 'Cat', 'Stevens', 'score', 'effect', 'tying', 'various', 'episodes', 'so', 'firmly', 'together', 'would', 'be', 'horrendously', 'film', 'could', 'stand', 'remaster', 'only', 'serious', 'complaint', 'DVD', 'release', 'indeed', 'film', 'release', 'bells', 'whistles', ""n't"", 'single', 'bonus', 'be', 'had', 'Not', 'everyone', 'will', 'like', 'HAROLD', 'AND', 'MAUDE', 'Many', 'continue', 'agree', 'film', 'indeed', 'creepy', 'off-putting', 'world', 'where', 'conformity', 'over-valued', 'always', 'will', 'forget', 'such', 'small-minded', 'hobgoblins', 'HAROLD', 'AND', 'MAUDE', 'wickedly', 'funny', 'deeply', 'touching', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'it.GFT', 'Amazon', 'Reviewer']",N/A
220616,A3M5O6UHXO9IBU,6300216268,Gary,"[4, 24]","I'm puzzled as to why some people have adopted this movie as a life manifesto as it is rather a nasty piece of work. Counter culture perniciousness is never far from the surface and the death stuff is pure 'Addams Family' corn, although undeniably amusing on that level.Someone here mentioned the curious adoption of an 'Ubermensch' philosophy by Maude reminiscent of her war time captors and I don't know whether or not it was intended ironically. Before the fall she was obviously part of the same bourgeoise. Mind you, Hitler was a bit of a pleb and skint, too. Anyway, does 'aiming above morality' mean lack of responsibility to those closest to you? Despite surely being aware of Harold's emotional vulnerability, Maude does not make her 'saturday' intentions clear to him, other than as a vague reference in passing. The expression on Ruth Gordon's face as an actress while dropping this bombshell to Harold suggests she did not truly believe in this scene or the film as a whole, which uses the smokescreen of eccentricity to excuse Maude's lack of clarity. But since she is clearly articulate on most matters, there is an ambivalence at the heart of this picture. She appears to cruelly lead him on, only to crush him with a bromide. What are we to make of all of this? Even an offbeat film needs to maintain a certain internal logic. Likewise, stealing cars that may have been needed in a life and death emergency leaves a nasty taste. If there is an epiphany here, then I cannot see it.This lack of internal logic extends to the direction, too. Ashby has great quirky timing but there is also a curious dishonesty at work. On the first date, how could Harold have got out from under those sheets and replaced them with a dummy without the girl in the house noticing? It would have taken exceptional sleight of hand and the director doesn't convince us. Likewise the business with Harold's hand on the second date. He clearly uses his real hands for the mouth freshner but are we then expected to believe he could have somehow slipped a false hand on to his sleave (miraculously lengthened) in front of his guest? This sloppy attitude can be seen in the opening scene. The shot behind Harold's head shows the rope not touching his body. From the other side we clearly see the rope going into his shoulder to support his weight. Also, in a later scene, the motorcycle cop aiming to shoot the fleeing protaganists with a civilian clearly walking into view. Should any of this matter in what is basically a comedy of (bad) manners? I think the film wants it both ways, that is seriousness and silliness, but it doesn't think it has to try too hard. However, if you sacrifice credibility in a style of dead pan realism you will not get away with it. Perhaps someone should have reminded Mr Ashby that comedy is, in fact, a serious business.The main compensations in 'Harold and Maude' are the little details. The motorcycle cop's trouser problem. The way various vehicles splutter into life and barely get going suggesting the vulnerability of us all in a changing world. Harold's legs in the opening scene and his petulant reaction to furniture obstructing his way. The peculiar pause when Maude asks Harold whether it's wrong to pose nude.As a whole though, it is distinctly uneven. The 'took my head' scene does not work but the actress scene is absolutely inspired.This is the archetypal cult movie and beggers the question as to whether films can ever be 'cult' like this again, what with the closure of 'rep' cinemas which traditionally supported these pictures and the ready avaliability of home video. Will the definition of 'cult' simply mean failure at the box office?The picture quality is reasonable.

This review is not about the movie but the blu-ray release.So the question becomes is it an overall better picture than the DVD? My simple answer is, yes, slightly better. Only a tiny bit better. If I would rate the picture quality of the DVD version as a 5 of 10, I would give the blu-ray release picture quality a 5.2 of 10 scale.I've been watching on an up-converting Panasonic Blu-ray player, watching with an Optoma 3D projector on a glass-bead screen. There is a slight improvement in resolution with the blu-ray version. There is still video noise and grainy-ness because lots of the movie is shot in dark settings. I also watched on a Vizio BR player and TV and had about the same change compared to the DVD.One of the benchmarks I use is when Harold and Maude are sitting outside near San Fransisco Bay. There is a highway sign in the distance. This is about 69 minutes into the film. The ability to read the sign is really not improved, even though it is mostly in focus.

I had an idea that it was an odd romance between a very young man and an elderly woman played by the always great Ruth Gordon. I was in for a surprise. HAROLD AND MAUDE is not a tender May-December romance. Two very broken people find each other and enjoy their secret world together.Bud Cort is truly remarkable as Harold. No doubt this was his most famous role and he totally takes over the part of Harold, the confused man-child. At first, it seems like he is a young teenager and later he seems older. Cort is able to play a full range with his boyish looks. Harold has an obsession with death. He enjoys staging fake suicides in front of his mother, played but a delightful Vivian Pickles. Pickles is so straightforward with her bizarre fun. She adds some humor to the movie.Harold also enjoys going to funerals--anyone's funeral. He doesn't know them but he shows up as a polite mourner. He enounters the feisty Maude at a funeral and they become fast friends. Her zest for life and disregard for authority entices Harold. It seems like they were destined to be together despite a 50+ year age difference.I know HAROLD AND MAUDE is a cult classic but I just could not enjoy the film. It seemed silly and with no message. The style of filming makes the film look so dated even though much older films do not have such a dated feel.I was hoping to get a deeper insight into these two quirky characters and a brief few seconds almost one hour into the film had me thinking it was all finally going to fall into place. I won't give anything away but there is one very quick shot of something profound that would totally explain why Maude is Maude. It's a quick flash and would be easy to miss. The revelation is brief and intense but not mentioned after that. It's not even clear if Harold realizes with it all means.HAROLD AND MAUDE was just such an all around disappointment.

Wes Anderson borrowed basically his entire style from this movie. The dark tinge, the slow motion, the brilliantly choreographed indie soundtrack. The two leads in this film are pitch-perfect, particularly a young and beguiling Bud Cort whose suicide attempts are movie comic gold (a weird sentence, I know). Take one instance when his mother organizes a blind date. Mommy dearest and the date are foregrounded in the ornate dining room as Harold wanders around in the yard beyond, covering himself in gauze and gasoline and apparently lighting himself ablaze. The date reacts with appropriate horror just as Harold emerges to shake her hand. The scene doesn't sound funny on paper, but it is a gut-splitter. So too, Harold floating in a pool, Harold methodically loading a handgun as his Mom fills out dating paperwork for her pious preferences. And who can forget Harold and Maude meandering from funeral to funeral? Maude is a free-spirit, an ancient whimsical creation despite horrors of her past explained in a flash late in the film. She is a perfect counterpart to Harold. They are arguably the best on-screen couple in history. The only scene that is a bit too wacky is the scene in which Harold eludes his war-hawk uncle by seemingly murdering Maude (this is never mentioned again and seems slightly cartoonish that he got away with it scott-free). This minor snafu aside, the film is a wonder, beautiful and grim in equal measure.

Bernabo,"[5, 6]","First off you cannot tell me that the people at the American Film Institute did not know exactly what they were doing when they had to pick a film for this particular slot on their Top 100 Love Stories.  I certainly have found memories of ""Harold and Maude,"" which must have been one of the first black comedies I ever saw (along with ""M*A*S*H"" and ""The Hospital"").  This is a film where a lot of people must have had their heads explode trying to decide if they were more offended by Harold's hobby of committing fake suicides for the ""benefit"" of his mother or the fact that the 20-year old Harold has an affair with the 79-year old Maude.That is basically all you know about this particular film to decide if it is even remotely close to your cup of tea.  Screenwriter Colin Higgins, who went on to write the ""Foul Play"" and ""Nine to Five,"" and director Hal Ashby, who went on to do ""Coming Home"" and ""Being There,"" hit a pair of bullseyes with the casting of this quirky little story.  Bud Cort plays Harold and you almost forget how good of a job he does with his part because Ruth Gordon has the part of her life as Maude.  Rediscovered in her Oscar winning Supporting Actress role in ""Rosemary's Baby,"" Gordon certainly was not going to find a lot of plumb roles for somebody her age--then along came this script because sometimes good things happen to good people.  You are guaranteed that you will never forget this movie.Maude's Words of Wisdom: (1) ""Vice, virtue, it's best not to be too moral--you cheat yourself out of too much life. Aim above morality.""  (2) ""Harold, everyone has the right to make an ass out of themselves. You can't let the world judge you too much."" (3) ""A lot of people enjoy being dead. But they're not dead, really, they're just backing away from life. Reach out. Take a chance. Get hurt, even! Play as well as you can. Go team! GO! Give me an L! Give me an I! Give me a V! Give me an E! L-I-V-E! LIVE! ...Otherwise, you got nothing to talk about in the locker room.""If you enjoy ""Harold and Maude,"" then check out these other films on the AFI's list: This is a hard one.

220651,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,6300216268,Lee Armstrong,"[3, 3]","&quot;Harold &amp; Maude&quot; must be my favorite movie of all time.  I've probably seen it at least 40 times.  Perhaps that's why the DVD wound up under this year's Christmas tree for me.  Director Hal Ashby does a wonderful job with this offbeat flick.  After winning a Best Editing Oscar for &quot;In the Heat of the Night,&quot; this was Ashby's 2nd film as director to be followed by an impressive list of classics, &quot;Coming Home,&quot; &quot;Shampoo,&quot; &quot;The Last Detail,&quot; &quot;Bound for Glory,&quot; and &quot;Being There&quot; before he died of cancer in 1988.  Not a frame is wasted.Bud Cort and Ruth Gordon are magnificent as the leads in this unlikely love story.  Gordon who won an Oscar for &quot;Rosemary's Baby&quot; is full of life as Dame Marjorie Chardam or Maude.  She gets the classic lines, &quot;How the world still dearly loves a cage,&quot; and &quot;It's best to aim above morality; otherwise you got nothing to talk about in the locker room.&quot;  Bud Cort as wide-eyed Harold draws us inside his heart, despite the incredibly bizarre suicidal behavior.  But as is referenced several times in the lines, &quot;It's absurd&quot;; and H&amp;M is an absurdist film, showing alienation from society.The richness of the film is reflected in the great care with the minor characters.  Charles Tyner as Uncle Victor is described as General MacArthur's &quot;right hand man,&quot; only to be shown as a military officer whose right hand has been amputated.  Vivian Pickles is incredible as Harold's mother, one who lives in her own world.  From the moment we see Harold hanging in the drawing room and his mother casually calling to reschedule her hair appointment, we know we are in for a very unusual look at competing values.The three dates are each marvelous cameo performances.  Will Geer's daughter Ellen Geer who has also played in &quot;Clear &amp; Present Danger&quot; &amp; &quot;Patriot Games&quot; plays actress Sunshine Dore (Door actually!) who commits hari-kari.  Shari Summers as the wide eyed Edith Fern who sells chicken feed to not quite the whole Southwest gets to watch Harold chop off his hand with a clever.  Cort's smile as she exits is a perfect Mona Lisa.  Judy Engles who plays Candy and bubbles about majoring in Poli Sci as Harold apparently sets himself aflame is priceless as is her insane exit from frame.  Eric Christmas as the priest who starred in other odd classics like &quot;Porky's&quot; &amp; &quot;Attack of the Killer Tomatoes&quot; is marvelously revolting as he tells Harold that the thought of his young flesh commingling with Maude makes him want to vomit.Harold &amp; Maude is so well loved for so many reasons.  Maude's odorifics where Harold smells snow is magical.  Maude's description of the lillies having so many observable differences when Harold comments that they're all the same is powerful, followed by her pointing to a graveyard and saying, &quot;I think much of the world's sorrow is from people who are actually this (flowers), but allow themselves to be treated as that (gravestones, dead).&quot;The ultimate reason why &quot;Harold &amp; Maude&quot; is considered classic by so many is that it touches universal truths in our hearts.

I must have been the only person in the audience who had never seen this iconic black-humor film before, because the entire audience applauded for every credit that came on the screen both at the beginning and again at the end. It was obviously a cult film with a rabid cult following, and I wondered what I was getting myself in for.Well. I had no idea what I'd been missing! Harold and Maude (Maude is played by the inimitable Ruth Gordon in one of the best roles of her very long career) is perhaps the blackest of black comedies - and it's a hoot and a half - and then some. It portrays the unlikely but, given the context, perfectly understandable relationship (love affair?) between a death-obsessed teenager, Harold, and an life-celebrating octogenarian widow, Maude. They meet (where else) at a funeral of someone that neither of them knows and they recognize their weird common-ground: funerals.This movie is sweet. It's endearing, touching, beautiful, life-affirming - it's a romance and a passionate plea to reach out and grab life by the lapels, suck it of its essence before it's too late.Marvelous, marvelous - but a warning: you've got to be a certain kind of quirky person in a particularly quirky frame of mind to appreciate it.

220683,A3EH76UZCIWDJX,6300216268,Plurabelle,"[15, 17]","I first stumbeled upon this film back in 1987. I think one of the main reasons this film has such a devoted (if cult) following, is the fact that the message it delivers...living your life to the fullest, and embracing love no matter what kind of package it comes in...is rendered in such a quiet, wonderful way, you can't help but believe.The movie introduces us to Harold. a quiet, if slightly odd young man, so desperate for the attention of his mother, that he stages various &quot;suicides&quot; on a regular basis, just to try and get a reaction from her. We soon learn that the one thing that actually makes Harold happy, is to attend funerals. Which is where, he ends up meeting Maude...a fellow funeral groupie. In contrast, Maude is a soon to be 80 yr old fireball of life and chaos, who counts 'barrowing' total strangers cars, and liberating canaries from pet stores, as hobbies.This movie is at once incredibly funny (as morbid as it sounds...Harold's various &quot;suicides&quot; are carried out with incressingly funnier results), and terribly sad (one of the final sequences, revolving around Cat Steven's gorgeous song &quot;Trouble&quot;, is one of the most heartbreaking, and beautifully acted scenes you will ever see on film.).Harold and Maude's relationship could have very easily come off as contrived, or forced, or just plain unbelivable. But the casting of Ruth Gordon and Bud Cort could not have been more perfect. They completely make these characters their own, and bring them to life in a way no one else would have been able to. And i also have to say that Colin Higgins script and especially the directing of Hal Asby are both top notch. Asby's subtle direction is wonderful, especially in the &quot;Trouble&quot; sequence mentioned above, where he lets Cort's facial expressions convey far more to the audience then any amount of dialogue ever could.",5,A Perfect Gem,1064361600,"09 24, 2003",2003,1883,"['first', 'stumbeled', 'film', 'back', '1987', 'think', 'one', 'main', 'reasons', 'film', 'devoted', 'cult', 'following', 'fact', 'message', 'living', 'life', 'fullest', 'embracing', 'love', 'matter', 'what', 'kind', 'package', 'rendered', 'such', 'quiet', 'wonderful', 'way', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'believe.The', 'movie', 'introduces', 'Harold', 'quiet', 'slightly', 'odd', 'young', 'man', 'so', 'desperate', 'attention', 'mother', 'various', 'quot', 'quot', 'regular', 'basis', 'just', 'try', 'get', 'reaction', 'soon', 'learn', 'one', 'thing', 'actually', 'Harold', 'happy', 'attend', 'funerals', 'Which', 'where', 'up', 'meeting', 'Maude', 'fellow', 'funeral', 'groupie', 'contrast', 'Maude', 'soon', 'be', '80', 'yr', 'old', 'fireball', 'life', 'chaos', 'who', ""'barrowing"", 'total', 'strangers', 'cars', 'liberating', 'canaries', 'pet', 'stores', 'hobbies.This', 'movie', 'once', 'incredibly', 'funny', 'as', 'morbid', 'Harold', 'various', 'quot', 'quot', 'are', 'carried', 'incressingly', 'funnier', 'results', 'terribly', 'sad', 'one', 'final', 'sequences', 'revolving', 'Cat', 'Steven', 'gorgeous', 'song', 'quot', 'Trouble', 'quot', 'one', 'most', 'heartbreaking', 'beautifully', 'acted', 'scenes', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'film', '.Harold', 'Maude', 'relationship', 'could', 'have', 'very', 'easily', 'come', 'off', 'contrived', 'forced', 'just', 'plain', 'unbelivable', 'casting', 'Ruth', 'Gordon', 'Bud', 'Cort', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'perfect', 'completely', 'make', 'characters', 'own', 'bring', 'life', 'way', 'one', 'else', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'i', 'also', 'have', 'say', 'Colin', 'Higgins', 'script', 'especially', 'directing', 'Hal', 'Asby', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'Asby', 'subtle', 'direction', 'wonderful', 'especially', 'quot', 'Trouble', 'quot', 'sequence', 'mentioned', 'where', 'Cort', 'facial', 'expressions', 'convey', 'far', 'more', 'audience', 'then', 'amount', 'dialogue', 'ever', 'could']",N/A
220684,A39IY0JU5JI69G,6300216268,"Promise ""promise""","[1, 1]","I've heard about this film for years but somehow never saw it till now.  I'm sure that if I'd seen it when it came out in the early 70's I would have adored it. Now....well, it is dated.  The themes which were very important in those breakaway years are a little old now.We see a young, very disturbed man, trying to get his mother's attention by various stagings of suicides.  She is a wealthy socialite whose values Harold despises.  She buys him a Jaguar but he prefers driving an old hearse.  She arranges him to meet girls but he succeeds in acting so wierd that they all run away.  We are supposed to hate her and feel sorry for him...but after a while I was more sympathetic to her than I knew the film intended.  He really is a putz!His only interest, beyond staging suicides is attending funerals.  This is where he meets his match--Maude, a frisky woman on the verge of turning 80.  We don't know how old Harold is, exactly.  To me he looked like a very young teenager.  Maude loves life as much as Harold seeks death so she teaches him to dance, to sing, to play music, smoke dope, drink and ultimately to make love.  Obviously she is the antithesis of his mom.  Maude somehow has the knack for driving any car she picks up on the street and has no compunction about taking them.  That's part of her ""live free!"" agenda.  Again, all of this was wonderful during the years the picture was made.  We see photos of Nixon and Pope Paul (the grim one) and Freud on the walls of various experts he is sent to consult.  We get the message loud and clear---this is a time to throw off traditional authority and go for it.The cast is great.  Ruth Gordon, a one-of-kind herself is perfect for the role of Maude.  (She was married to a much younger man, in ""real life."")  Bud Cort is excellent as Harold--at first so repressed and then gradually coming to life.

220685,A1H7Y5XKPGT0OS,6300216268,"Rama Rao ""Rama""","[1, 5]","The theme of the movie is edgy and perhaps inappropriate for its extreme depiction of a deviant behavior. The story is about a wealthy and obsessive teenager named Harold who is self-destructive and preoccupied with the thoughts of suicide, self mutilation, fascination with attending burial ceremonies in the local cemetery, and the destruction of property. His wealthy and somewhat eccentric mother, tired of his compulsive behavior, helps to broaden his social skills by sending him to a therapist, arranging for a date through dating services and even buying him a nice car. At the end she even forces him to join the army. Ultimately it is his friendship with anarchic 80 year old woman by the name Maude that materializes into a strange but positive experience in his life. This is not exactly May next-December romance but a relationship in which he finds many common interests with her that turn into love and romance. On The day he proposes to her, to the dislikes of his mother, family and friends; he finds out that she is dying and in fact that is the last day of her life. It doesn't appear to be tragic because of so many inequalities and inadequacies in their lives, but the relationship is depicted in a non-sexual manner with sensibilities and finding common interests irrespective of their wide age difference.The movie is set on 1960s themes of anti-establishment with a Woodstock-sense of responsibility. Yet Harold exhibits strange a sense of responsibility when he finds Maude destroying and stealing property, he tells her; ""you are upsetting people,"" regarding his appointment with therapist, he says, ""He can't miss the appt."" and expresses sympathy for Maude when she says she has no friends. The movie in many depicts the strange thoughts of many young people of today who succumb to drug and other self-destructive behavior. It is a study of a sociological and psychological condition that is harder to understand and appreciate.The highlight of the movie is the fine performance of Ruth Gordon as Maude and Vivian Pickles as Mrs. Chasen, the wealthy mother of Harold. The film is strongly supported by Cat Steven's fine music that provides the soundtrack.1.Saturday Night Live (SNL) January 22, 1977 - Ruth Gordan / Chuck Berry",5,Strange afflictions,1336608000,"05 10, 2012",2012,2256,"['theme', 'movie', 'edgy', 'perhaps', 'inappropriate', 'extreme', 'depiction', 'deviant', 'behavior', 'story', 'wealthy', 'obsessive', 'teenager', 'named', 'Harold', 'who', 'self-destructive', 'preoccupied', 'thoughts', 'suicide', 'mutilation', 'fascination', 'attending', 'burial', 'ceremonies', 'local', 'cemetery', 'destruction', 'property', 'wealthy', 'somewhat', 'eccentric', 'mother', 'tired', 'compulsive', 'behavior', 'broaden', 'social', 'skills', 'sending', 'therapist', 'arranging', 'date', 'dating', 'services', 'even', 'buying', 'nice', 'car', 'end', 'even', 'join', 'army', 'Ultimately', 'friendship', 'anarchic', '80', 'year', 'old', 'woman', 'name', 'Maude', 'strange', 'positive', 'experience', 'life', 'not', 'exactly', 'May', 'next-December', 'romance', 'relationship', 'many', 'common', 'interests', 'turn', 'love', 'romance', 'day', 'dislikes', 'mother', 'family', 'friends', 'out', 'dying', 'fact', 'last', 'day', 'life', ""n't"", 'appear', 'be', 'tragic', 'so', 'many', 'inequalities', 'inadequacies', 'lives', 'relationship', 'depicted', 'non-sexual', 'manner', 'sensibilities', 'finding', 'common', 'interests', 'irrespective', 'wide', 'age', 'difference.The', 'movie', 'set', '1960s', 'themes', 'anti-establishment', 'Woodstock-sense', 'responsibility', 'Harold', 'strange', 'sense', 'responsibility', 'when', 'Maude', 'destroying', 'stealing', 'property', 'are', 'upsetting', 'people', 'regarding', 'appointment', 'therapist', 'ca', ""n't"", 'miss', 'appt', 'sympathy', 'Maude', 'when', 'friends', 'movie', 'many', 'depicts', 'strange', 'thoughts', 'many', 'young', 'people', 'today', 'who', 'drug', 'other', 'self-destructive', 'behavior', 'study', 'sociological', 'psychological', 'condition', 'harder', 'understand', 'appreciate.The', 'highlight', 'movie', 'fine', 'performance', 'Ruth', 'Gordon', 'Maude', 'Vivian', 'Pickles', 'Mrs.', 'Chasen', 'wealthy', 'mother', 'Harold', 'film', 'strongly', 'supported', 'Cat', 'Steven', 'fine', 'music', 'soundtrack.1.Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'SNL', 'January', '22', '1977', 'Ruth', 'Gordan', '/', 'Chuck', 'Berry']",N/A

220699,A328AACLGP6ZI3,6300216268,"R. Prescott ""longplayer1""","[2, 3]","I was told about this film by a friend when it came out. After days of them insisting that I see it, I was in downtown Portland, Oregon and it was playing at one of the theaters w/ a special sneak preview of a film and a second feature. So, you got 3 films for the price of one. Having absolutely nothing better to do, I decided to go see it by myself. When I arrived at the theater, the showing of Harold and Maude was just getting out. The theater was extremely crowded for a Sunday matinee. When the next film started up, the theater was almost empty. I watched both the sneak preview, and the co-feature and while I was waiting for Harold and Maude to start, the theater began to fill up again until it was FULL. Harold and Maude was the draw! I have never enjoyed a film as much as I did Harold and Maude. After that I returned to the theater 26 times with everyone I could find to see the film. They in turn brought their friends and etc... Harold and Maude was held over at the Guild Theater for a record 42 weeks. I cut the article out of the paper with a picture of the marquee, when they said it had broken records for films held over in the city of Portland at that time.For years I watched for the film on TV. I never saw it again until one day, after VHS films began to get popular, I found it in a bargain bin in a K-Mart in Idaho and the phenomenon started again. I showed it to all my new friends, relatives and anyone I could talk into sitting throught the film. I have never loaned out my VHS. Am purchasing it on DVD as we speak. And when I get my DVD....believe me, the phenomenon will begin once again as I've moved from Oregon, to Idaho, and now to Nevada... I will create another entire Harold and Maude fan base! This is a wonderful film. Imaginative, Original, Funny, Sad and Refreshing! I see something new every time I watch the film. By the time I'm dead, I'm sure I'll have every frame memorized. This is a film you SHARE with as many people as you can.After viewing the film, I did find a copy of Ruth Gordon's autobiography. It was great reading. I only wish that I'd met her in person. I saw her on Johnny Carson w/ Bud Cort when the film was celebrating one of it's anniversaries. Either for the VHS release, the DVD release or for a re-release of the film, I can't remember which. But, in the interview, Bud Cort said that many of his friends begged him not to take the role because they thought it would pidgeon hole his career to playing quirky roles. But, he said: ""Once I read the script, I knew that I had to play Harold and when I met Ruth, I knew why he fell in love with her."" They were close, tight friends until her untimely death. I have watched every thing on film I could find with either of these talented actors. Ruth found more fame playing Clint Eastwood's mother in the ""Every Which Way But Loose"" film and sequels. Bud's career, was in fact pidgeoned holed to quirky roles so far, but, this is the film that EVERYONE MUST SEE BEFORE THEY DIE! The soundtrack is almost ALL Cat Stevens. If you ever wondered what people saw in him, this movie will show you. It's unfortunate that his career has been overshadowed by his conversion to muslem. He was then and still is an incredible writer/performer. This film proves that.This film is a black comedy that looks at life, love, war, politics, fashion, music, art and most anything else you can think of through the eyes of a 79 yr old woman and a young man who meets her at a funeral for someone neither of them knew.

We'd lived together for 5 years when I saw Harold and Maude again--for the first time in a while.  I'd forgotten that at the  heart of this black comedy was a love story.  This script, reportedly  written by a pool cleaner, with no formal script writing training, reaches  into your heart and drags out the realization that love is blind.  Harold,  who is obsessed with death and destruction, finds beauty in life and the  world through Maude.  She opens his eyes to the beauty of nature while  ridiculing the rules of a homocentric world.  Beauty, Harold realizes, is  not in the eyes of the beholder so much as it is in everything, no matter  how small or insignificant.  In one scene, Harold remarks that all the  flowers look the same.  &quot;But they're not,&quot; Maude urges him.  &quot;They're all different.&quot;  And therein lies the beauty of a busy  world.  Everything is beautiful, if we just take the time to look.  Hal  Ashby's genious as a director shines with this quirky script that wastes  not a line while taking on huge social and political concepts with the  playfullness of 80 year old Maude who teaches 20 something Harold how to be  a kid again.

220711,A2AREUQXKG7PCG,6300216268,Snow Leopard,"[358, 381]","The editor's review of this film is a fair enough description of the plot.  One should add that, despite being made in 1971, the movie manages not to look dated, precisely because it makes such fun of the early 70s style, and that the acting by the three main characters (Harold, Maude and Harold's mother) is simply inspired.  Ruth Gordon is splendid of course, while Bud Cort gives a lifetime performance, but it is the portrayal of Harold's mother by Vivian Pickles (what a splendid name for someone in the role) that has to be the most undercelebrated aspect of this film.  Her breezy blitheness, outraged exasperation, and British sensibility are all just too wonderful.But before I go on ...NOTE: It has been been pointed out to me that since some would consider this review to contain spoilers that I ought to warn people ahead of time. However, I'll add that it's  hard to say how much spoilers actually spoil this movie; spoilers may help to make the movie's wisdom more readily apparent on a first viewing.  In any case, there are several ahead.ADDITIONAL NOTE: Some Amazonites have complained that they encountered spoilers in my review despite presumably reading my disclaimer and warning (above) that there are spoilers in my review. I find this odder than some of Harold's mother's behavior, and it makes me want to ask, without at all intending sarcasm, ""If you didn't appreciate the disclaimer when you read it, how will reading spoilers harm your appreciation of the film?"" ... To paraphrase Maude: ""Ah people ...."" (They're my species.) ... Meanwhile, back at the review:Filling out a dating questionnaire for her son, in response to the question ""Do you find the idea of wife-swapping offensive?"" his mother answers, ""I find the question offensive."" In response to the question, ""Do you feel the women's liberation movement has gone too far,"" she replies, ""It cer-tain-ly has.""  Even ""Harold, eat your beets"" is delivered so wonderfully that it's memorable.  Eric Christmas also makes the bit-part of a priest into something delightful and memorable, principally by one splendid monologue.But is this really a black comedy?  Personally, I think of black comedies as being morbid and mordant, which Harold & Maude certainly has elements of, but also ultimately cynical.  One should not mistake grimness in a film as a sign of nihilism; as the Japanese proverb runs, the ending is all-important.  The film ultimately is not about an intergenerational love affair (surely the most ""shocking"" aspect of the film), but about Harold learning to embrace life. And it is precisely to make as effective as possible Harold's decision to live life to the fullest (rather than continue to prefer to be dead)  that it is first necessary to make his life miserable.As insanely amusing as much of the movie is, it is also full of profundity after profundity from Maude, who is a nearly continuous font of wisdom, with laughter and humor being simply the most crucial values in her wisdom.  When she asks Harold what he does for fun, he takes her to a picnic in a wrecking yard.  She replies, ""I'll grant you, it has a certain something. But is it enough?""  When Harold declines her offer of wine, she replies, ""Oh go on, it's organic."" And most beautiful of all, when Harold says, ""I don't want you to die, Maude. I love you,"" she replies with perfect calmness, ""Harold, that's wonderful. Now go out and love some more.""  If you've been caught up in the genuine spirit of this movie, the line will not seem like some breezy brush-off, but may instead bring tears to your eyes.The scene of Harold's grief after Maude's death, intercutting silent images of him waiting in a hospital room and driving recklessly around the Marin headlands in the Jaguar he has converted into a hearse while Cat Steven's song, ""Trouble"" plays, is very well-done and sets up the climax of the film beautifully.  Cat Steven's soundtrack throughout, in fact, is a splendid selection of songs, and certainly makes clear that, however morbid things might seem, this film is ultimately life-affirming in a very profound way.Having watched this movie many, many times and having yet to tire of it, it seems to me there is more to it than meets the eye.  And not just because, when Harold gives Maude an engraved birthday gift, she says, ""This is the nicest gift anyone has given me in a long time,"" and then throws it into the San Francisco Bay saying, ""That way, I'll always know where it is."" And not just because one eventually notices, in the briefest of passing shots, the tattoo of a concentration camp inmate on Maude's arm.  In the final analysis, it seems to me that Harold is actually already dead. That his theatrical suicides aren't faked at all, but also don't succeed because he himself is not aware that he's actually dead.  It's probably more accurate to say that the director pushes the narrative to the point where Harold seems to be actually dead and not just faking, precisely to make his choice of life at the end all the more inspiring.And inspiring it is.  Harold & Maude is not (alas) for everyone.  A viewer who is hidebound like the movie's priest, colonel or mother (read church, state, authority) will find Maude's sometimes gentle, sometimes brash mocking of convention more annoying than enlightening, just as the (not depicted) sexual relationship between Harold and Maude is the thing many people who miss the point remember about the movie.  To this, Maude might say, as she does to a police officer, ""Don't be officious. You're not yourself when you're officious. That's the curse of a government job."" Or as she says, when the priest replies that he didn't like the way she'd painted his statue of the Virgin Mary, ""Give it time. It'll grow on you. Some things take a while to appreciate.""",5,In my All-Time Top Ten,1042934400,"01 19, 2003",2003,5800,"['editor', 'review', 'film', 'fair', 'enough', 'description', 'plot', 'One', 'should', 'add',

Only weak point is story didn't show why Maude found Harold appealing. It showed why Maude appealed to Harold, but not why Harold appealed to Maude.  Suspect that Harold was Maude's final cause as she spent her life fighting for justice, but would've preferred to have Harold's beauty showcased as Maude's was. The writer showed her to be interesting, funny, unique, sexy, beautiful on the inside and out. The writer worked hard to do that because he knew his audience would not ordinarily accept a reverse May-December romance, so he showcased Maude, but he forgot to showcase Harold. Other than that, I really enjoyed it.

220716,A10C5CJK1YKGV0,6300216268,Steffan Piper,"[10, 10]","Hal Ashby's masterpiece Harold and Maude is so many people's favourite movie, that it's mind-boggling. When the film was released in 1971 it was panned by the bulk of the reviewers and was thought of as something that would be quickly forgotten as it was not easy for the Academic journalists to pigeonhole. Both, Bud Cort and Ruth Gordon won Golden Globes for best Actress and Best Actor that year even though the press had been grossly unkind. Several American theatres even played this film repetitively for two years, day after day, just because it was that good.The screenplay for Harold and Maude was an idea that was spawned for Collin Higgin's thesis for the UCLA screenwriting MFA program and the film took off from there.The bookis also available, for those interested, but be advised the book was put together after the film and reads a bit dry, and doesn't tell an expanded story as one would think it would, but rather a slightly `different story', if you will. But don't get me wrong, the book is still very entertaining and a good read.The film is about a struggle between the value of life and a young man named Harold Chasen and the mentoring brought by his new friend Maude. Not until he meets and forms a bond with Maude does he start to understand that the world, and himself isn't on the verge of an apocalypse as he might have been led to believe by his self-indulgent and caddish mother, wonderfully imagined and portrayed by Vivian Pickles. Don't you just love that accent, and her random French phrasing?Harold obviously was meant to be portrayed as someone suffering, as we see multiple attempts at suicide, which is a large part of his verbal and physical vocabulary. He has either an absent or dead father which is a theme that is not addressed but does make the viewer wonder how much it plays upon his psyche. The real story is the grand coupe of how Maude wins him over, getting him to really embrace and appreciate life, which is incredibly touching, making this movie one of the most unforgettable films of all time. The score, woven in beautifully by Cat Stevens, heightens the importance and greatness of the film, which continually pull at the heart-strings and the mind.Some people, smirk and pull away if they've heard about this film, but haven't seen it. They always say: ""Oh, that film. Not interested."" I've met about a handful of these types and they're typically bothered by Harold and Maude's relationship. Yawwwnnnnn. Others say they're always bothered by the suicide aspect, let me tell you that the thought of suicide has got me through many a dark night, and I don't find it offensive or inappropriate in the slightest. All I can say is do yourself a favor and watch it from beginning to end, uninterrupted and just accept it for what it is. Just because an element of a film bothers you -- doesn't mean that the film is bad, it just means that the film stirred an uncomfortable emotion in you. That's all.It would be nice to see this film get the re-master and frame-by-frame cleaning and color correction treatment. The DVD quality looks like a really good video transfer, but a video transfer nonetheless. It's presented in 5.1 Dolby surround, which is a plus, but this film really begs a commentary, extras, stills, all of that which is common on other releases.And yes, for the record ... this is in my top three favourite all-time films.

My best friend and I liked to go to movies so we went and saw it.  We liked it so much that we stayed and watched it 3 times (that was in the days when you could do that) and it was a double feature.  To this day, I don't know what the other movie was.  This movie contains so much about how I feel about life and what is important.  I showed it to some of my nephews when they were around middle school age and said something like, ""If you want to know what Uncle Steve thinks is important in life, this movie contains most of those things"".  After we watched it, laughed at all the funny parts and were sad at Maude's death, we talked about it.  They said they could really see how the movie was the same as they knew I felt.  I was glad that they didn't just ignore an old movie or be grossed out because of Maude's age.Anyway, I still love this movie as much as always and don't forget Cat Stevens.  His music has influencd me just as much as the humor, events and performance.

220724,A3U56M0Y8LYO6J,6300216268,"Steven Y. ""Pop Culture Addict""","[21, 24]","Hal Ashby's ""Harold and Maude"" is a story of a young man who comes of age when he falls in love with a passionate woman.  While that generic description aptly describes many Hollywood films released over the years, rest assured that this outing is most definitely unique.Harold Parker Chasen (Bud Cort) does not have the easiest of times relating with other people.  Perhaps it is because of his smothering mother or perhaps it is because he has an odd fascination with death.  Whatever the reason, Harold's life changes when he meets Maude (Ruth Gordon) at a funeral.  Harold realizes he has found a kindred spirit and romance soon blossoms between the two despite the fact that Ruth is significantly older than him.At first glance, it would appear that ""Harold and Maude"" is a bad taste effort on the part of everyone involved.  However, this would be selling the film short.  ""Harold and Maude"" is really a charming and uplifting black comedy.  The cringe factor is essentially non-existent because the film does not exploit the age difference between Harold and Maude for cheap laughs.  It instead takes the high ground and focuses on the newfound lust for life both Harold and Maude have found since meeting one another.  Thus, by choosing to substitute poignancy and optimism in place of crudeness, ""Harold and Maude"" ends up being a strangely delightful film.",3,"""It's best not to be too moral.

Looking it up on various internet sites I discovered the film was put out on DVD in 2000 and is long out-of-print. Luckily, I went to a garage sale recently and found a copy for five dollars!""Harold and Maude"" is considered by most people as one of the greatest Hollywood films ever making it on the top 10 list of various critics' list, and the movie has been preserved in the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress.The film is really a dark comedy that deals with a young boys infatuation with death. Harold (played brilliantly by Bud Cort) constantly thinks of ways in which to die, drives a hearse, and stages different acts of dying, all while attending funerals as if he's going to an opening of a new movie. His mother becomes frustrated as she regards Harold's behavior as odd. It is at one of these funerals where he meets an 80 year old woman named Maude, superbly played by Oscar winner Ruth Gordon (who won the golden statue for her role in ""Rosemary's Baby""). The two form a bond as Harold sees Maude as somewhat of an idol, someone who has lived a long life, but is that much closer to dying, something he strives for. Through Maude the young man soon realizes the importance of staying alive and that search for happiness as life is too short. Like she says in one of the movies best scenes, ""L I V E.....live!!!!!""Many who haven't seen ""Harold and Maude"" are turned off by the subject matter as they don't want to watch a film that deals with death and dying. However, the movie is more than that: it is funny, poignant, well-written, and extremely well-acted.

I've seen the movie as a teenager, as a mother of sons, and, now, as one who has just reached middle age.  The movie speaks in different ways to each phase of a person's life, but in all cases it shows us how to live a life that is vibrant under any circumstances.Harold is obsessed with death. In a story Harold tells Maude, Harold once had a devastating experience with a science experiment in school and authorities thought he was dead.  His mother was mistakingly told he was dead, causing her to express authentic grief.  Therefore, Harold tries to recreate his death through mock suicide attempts in order to recapture the moment his mother expressed genuine love for him.  Harold's obsession with death is also metaphorical, portraying his lack of connection to what it means to feel alive.Maude is the conduit through which Harold discovers this connection.  She shows him how to live.  In response, Harold falls desperately in love with her.  When Maude dies, he is released from his obsession with death and in contrast becomes engaged with life.All of this may sound rather corney, but it's not.  The acting is first-rate and the movie isn't afraid to delve philosophically into the main theme, such as when Harold recognizes the Holocaust tattoo on Maude's arm and she reveals her wonder at the seagulls.
