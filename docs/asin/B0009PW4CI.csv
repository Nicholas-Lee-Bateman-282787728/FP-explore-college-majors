For one, Kino, as a young boy starts out ""white"", then grown up, he becomes Mexican/Indian with a bad looking tan.  The actors are all white, with tanned makeup, the language is way off-key, without a hint of true accent.  The plot is not memorable, nor sincere to the book.  But for the whitewashing of Hollywood, ironically, the Director is Mexican.  What happened there??!!If you have read this wonderful book, you can see that watching this movie is no reflection.  And it is easy to understand that the ""book version"" of many movies doesn't compare, but this is simply a different story.  Don't even try it.  Steinbeck would not only turn over in his grave, he would jump out!!  .....Rizzo",1,Sincere apologies to John Steinbeck!,1171584000,"02 16, 2007",2007,808,"['way', 'can', 'ever', 'compare', 'd-grade', 'movie', 'one', 'best', 'classics', 'ever', 'Steinbeck', 'Pearl', 'one', 'Kino', 'young', 'boy', 'out', 'white', 'then', 'grown', 'up', 'Mexican/Indian', 'bad', 'looking', 'tan', 'actors', 'are', 'white', 'tanned', 'makeup', 'language', 'way', 'off-key', 'hint', 'true', 'accent', 'plot', 'not', 'memorable', 'sincere', 'book', 'whitewashing', 'Hollywood', 'ironically', 'Director', 'Mexican', 'What', 'happened', 'have', 'read', 'wonderful', 'book', 'can', 'see', 'watching', 'movie', 'reflection', 'easy', 'understand', 'book', 'version', 'many', 'movies', ""n't"", 'compare', 'simply', 'different', 'story', 'Do', ""n't"", 'even', 'try', 'Steinbeck', 'would', 'not', 'only', 'turn', 'over', 'grave', 'would', 'jump', 'out', '..Rizzo']",The Pearl

Race ""Jose Mango""","[0, 0]","Other reviewers have pretty much discussed how it varies from the actual book, and how Hollywood had decided to give the flick a happy ending and making everyone feel good after gnawing away on popcorn and candy bars. It has to be one of highly acclaimed Harris' worst movies. However, on a parting note, the scenery and photography were okay, but I believe Steinbeck is wondering 'what the hell happened?' but I'm sure that is a common concern among authors when their books are made into movies.",3,STEINBECK WOULD NOT BE HAPPY,1352073600,"11 5, 2012",2012,497,"['Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'pretty', 'much', 'discussed', 'how', 'actual', 'book', 'how', 'Hollywood', 'had', 'decided', 'give', 'flick', 'happy', 'ending', 'making', 'everyone', 'feel', 'good', 'gnawing', 'away', 'popcorn', 'candy', 'bars', 'be', 'one', 'highly', 'acclaimed', 'Harris', 'worst', 'movies', 'However', 'parting', 'note', 'scenery', 'photography', 'were', 'okay', 'believe', 'Steinbeck', 'wondering', 'hell', 'happened', ""'m"", 'sure', 'common', 'concern', 'authors', 'when', 'books', 'are', 'made', 'movies']",The Pearl

The acting was horrible and I don't think they had a casting director.  It looked like they walked out into the street and said, ""you, you and you - no acting required."" I could not sit through this movie and watch them murder one of my favorite stories.

910816,A3PLN4YGJ58NX0,B0009PW4CI,"Robert A. Bowers ""Bowers""","[2, 2]","Like many of the other reviewers, I am an English teacher and was very pleased to find this adaptation to use with my 9th grade class.  I have used the 1947 version but old black and white films tend to be heavy going for young audiences.  This version is nowhere near as satisfying as I would like, but to break down the likes and dislikes:It offers great visuals for the town, the village and the trek through the wilderness. It also offers good visuals for pearl diving.The pond fight with the tracker is  changed from the book but builds suspense nicely.Most of the actors, expecially Tarin, Harris, and Rivero are very good in my opinion.  Unlike some other reviewers, I like the added love scenes for Kino and Juana.  They are a young couple and in love.  It's nice for that to be seen,  although I could do without the heavy breathing scene!On the negative side:While Lucas Haas is acceptable as Kino, I find it very, very difficult to believe they couldn't have found a Latino actor better suited to the part.I show this movie to a young class of largely hispanic background; they know the difference! This is no longer the 1950's where you just smear brown makeup on white actors to make them ""ethnic"".I very much dislike the whole idea of the happy ending, as others have pointed out.  Steinbeck clearly states repeatedly in the text that Kino and his kind are discriminated against,oppressed,  and cheated from cradle to grave. That message is far from totally outdated even 60 years later. Frankly, I view the throwing away of the pearl as Kino's surrender to a system he now thinks it is not possible to escape rather than as any kind of victory of the common man. To lose that idea loses a great deal of the novel's strength in my opinion.I also am not crazy about identifying all the villiany so clearly with the character of the doctor.  I certainly am not convinced the doctor in the book would have the energy or the brains to be so wicked. I do understand it is a way to build up the role for a name actor like Harris so I can accept it. However, it certainly defeats the purpose of having the envy of the nameless, faceless surrounding community become one of Kino's main sources of conflict.So, all that said, I continue to show this film, but certainly not until after the book is read and as a means of discussion about the points I believe Steinbeck meant to make.",3,"Great visuals, but disappointing adaptation",1212969600,"06 9, 2008",2008,2388,"['many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'am', 'English', 'teacher', 'was', 'very', 'pleased', 'find', 'adaptation', 'use', '9th', 'grade', 'class', 'have', 'used', '1947', 'version', 'old', 'black', 'white', 'films', 'tend', 'be', 'heavy', 'going', 'young', 'audiences', 'version', 'nowhere', 'near', 'as', 'satisfying', 'would', 'like', 'break', 'down', 'likes', 'dislikes', 'great', 'visuals', 'town', 'village', 'trek', 'wilderness', 'also', 'good', 'visuals', 'pearl', 'diving.The', 'pond', 'fight', 'tracker', 'changed', 'book', 'builds', 'suspense', 'nicely.Most', 'actors', 'expecially', 'Tarin', 'Harris', 'Rivero', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'opinion', 'other', 'reviewers', 'like', 'added', 'love', 'scenes', 'Kino', 'Juana', 'are', 'young', 'couple', 'love', 'nice', 'be', 'seen', 'could', 'do', 'heavy', 'breathing', 'scene', 'negative', 'side', 'Lucas', 'Haas', 'acceptable', 'Kino', 'find', 'very', 'very', 'difficult', 'believe', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'found', 'Latino', 'actor', 'better', 'suited', 'part.I', 'show', 'movie', 'young', 'class', 'largely', 'hispanic', 'background', 'know', 'difference', 'no', 'longer', '1950', 'where', 'just', 'smear', 'brown', 'makeup', 'white', 'actors', 'make', 'ethnic', '.I', 'very', 'much', 'whole', 'idea', 'happy', 'ending', 'others', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'Steinbeck', 'clearly', 'states', 'repeatedly', 'text', 'Kino', 'kind', 'are', 'discriminated', 'oppressed', 'cheated', 'cradle', 'grave', 'message', 'far', 'totally', 'outdated', 'even', '60', 'years', 'later', 'Frankly', 'view', 'throwing', 'away', 'pearl', 'Kino', 'surrender', 'system', 'now', 'not', 'possible', 'escape', 'rather', 'kind', 'victory', 'common', 'man', 'lose', 'idea', 'great', 'deal', 'novel', 'strength', 'opinion.I', 'also', 'am', 'not', 'crazy', 'identifying', 'villiany', 'so', 'clearly', 'character', 'doctor', 'certainly', 'am', 'not', 'convinced', 'doctor', 'book', 'would', 'have', 'energy', 'brains', 'be', 'so', 'wicked', 'do', 'understand', 'way', 'build', 'up', 'role', 'name', 'actor', 'Harris', 'can', 'accept', 'However', 'certainly', 'purpose', 'having', 'envy', 'nameless', 'faceless', 'surrounding', 'community', 'become', 'one', 'Kino', 'main', 'sources', 'conflict.So', 'said', 'continue', 'show', 'film', 'certainly', 'not', 'book', 'read', 'means', 'discussion', 'points', 'believe', 'Steinbeck', 'meant', 'make']",The Pearl
