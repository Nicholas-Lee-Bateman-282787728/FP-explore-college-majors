299924,A358XP3X4U0X45,6302180279,bookloversfriend,"[9, 41]","I was puzzled when I saw this movie soon after it came out.  It seemed straight-forward: a professor wanted to improve the education and cultural level of a prostitute.  But why did he choose such dismal, depressing material?  Some of the most somber music of Bach, the Greek tragedians.  Why not some of the many happy classical pieces, many of them written by Bach?  Why not Aristophanes?  Or Sappho?The mystery begins to dissolve when you put together certain information: The filmmaker, Jules Dassin, was an American communist who was blacklisted and, like many of his comrades, left the country to make films abroad.  If this movie is seen as the first step in the Gramsci program to win by undermining Western culture, it makes sense.  Of course, like other such efforts it had to be sugar-coated to be swallowed.  Ilya, representing the people, is actually being corrupted by being introduced to Western culture.  We root for her to cast it off and return to her old self.  And the place chosen, of course, is Greece, the birthplace of Western culture.Did it work?  Probably not.  Everyone (including me) delighted in the theme song and enjoyed seeing the carefree, happy-go-lucky Ilya defying conventional mores.  And as for Bach, well, they never liked Bach anyway.Still, it was a first blow.  But it was far from the last.  A more militant effort was made in the late sixties, but it was a dismal failure.  During the seventies, the movement played dead and cast around for another strategy.  By the early eighties the new approach was in full swing: remain covert, don't mention a movement, and undermine Western culture by gaining control of the schools and colleges.  (If you want to know the blow-by-blow, you won't find it in any movie.  You'll have to read a book, The Rape of Alma Mater.  Many nonfiction books can give you details also, those by liberals being The Shadow University, The New Thought Police, and Who Stole Feminism?)The music is still good, and the main character Ilya still defies prudery, and people will still enjoy both without being persuaded of the evils of Western culture.",3,the hidden persuaders,1135900800,"12 30, 2005",2005,2114,"['was', 'puzzled', 'when', 'saw', 'movie', 'soon', 'came', 'out', 'seemed', 'straight-forward', 'professor', 'wanted', 'improve', 'education', 'cultural', 'level', 'prostitute', 'why', 'did', 'choose', 'such', 'dismal', 'depressing', 'material', 'most', 'somber', 'music', 'Bach', 'Greek', 'tragedians', 'Why', 'not', 'many', 'happy', 'classical', 'pieces', 'many', 'written', 'Bach', 'Why', 'not', 'Aristophanes', 'Sappho', 'mystery', 'dissolve', 'when', 'put', 'together', 'certain', 'information', 'filmmaker', 'Jules', 'Dassin', 'was', 'American', 'communist', 'who', 'was', 'blacklisted', 'many', 'comrades', 'left', 'country', 'make', 'films', 'abroad', 'movie', 'seen', 'first', 'step', 'Gramsci', 'program', 'win', 'undermining', 'Western', 'culture', 'sense', 'course', 'other', 'such', 'efforts', 'had', 'be', 'sugar-coated', 'be', 'swallowed', 'Ilya', 'representing', 'people', 'actually', 'being', 'corrupted', 'being', 'introduced', 'Western', 'culture', 'root', 'cast', 'off', 'return', 'old', 'self', 'place', 'chosen', 'course', 'Greece', 'birthplace', 'Western', 'culture.Did', 'work', 'Probably', 'not', 'Everyone', 'including', 'delighted', 'theme', 'song', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'carefree', 'happy-go-lucky', 'Ilya', 'defying', 'conventional', 'mores', 'Bach', 'well', 'never', 'liked', 'Bach', 'anyway.Still', 'was', 'first', 'blow', 'was', 'far', 'last', 'more', 'militant', 'effort', 'was', 'made', 'late', 'sixties', 'was', 'dismal', 'failure', 'seventies', 'movement', 'played', 'dead', 'cast', 'around', 'strategy', 'early', 'new', 'approach', 'was', 'full', 'swing', 'remain', 'covert', 'do', ""n't"", 'mention', 'movement', 'undermine', 'Western', 'culture', 'gaining', 'control', 'schools', 'colleges', 'want', 'know', 'blow-by-blow', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'have', 'read', 'book', 'Rape', 'Alma', 'Mater', 'Many', 'nonfiction', 'books', 'can', 'give', 'details', 'also', 'liberals', 'being', 'Shadow', 'University', 'New', 'Thought', 'Police', 'Who', 'Stole', 'Feminism', 'music', 'still', 'good', 'main', 'character', 'Ilya', 'still', 'prudery', 'people', 'will', 'still', 'enjoy', 'being', 'persuaded', 'evils', 'Western', 'culture']",N/A

299930,A2OOXUXSS03V3X,6302180279,David M. Goldberg,"[1, 3]","This is one of the ultimate feel-good movies of all time. There are many reasons why. Melina Mercouri's charismatic performance is paramount. Close behind is the infectious musical score that it is hard to get out of your head, and who would want to? It is important that in a film that explores the nature of love, all of the contributors should love making the film, and this sentiment shines through every frame, even with the bad guys.Dassin's manifold roles are harder to evaluate. He seems to have claimed the credit for writing the script that was apparently an original screenplay, and if so, he deserves high marks. As in most comedies with a serious intent, there are awkward and artificially-injected devices to help out the plot, such as the showering of gifts by the Ugly American upon the Greek Goddess using money from a gangster-pimp that she detests, and that causes their budding romance to blow up in his face; but overall there is as much genuine wit as in an average Woody Allen movie, and the characters as a whole are much more likeable than Woody's typical brood. Even without the benefit of colour, the settings with the sea and sunshine transport the viewer into an idylically magical world ( that unfortunately, does not really exist, least of all in modern Greece that for many decades has practised a rapacious and self-indulgent code in its treatment of tourists ). Still, the illusion is pleasant while it lasts. Dassin the director offers few of the stunning camera tricks he contrived in his earlier ""Rififi"", but there are a some visual gems, such as the 4 prostitutes with their 8 legs showing only from the waist downwards trotting briskly about their business. Dassin the actor is a real paradox. In ""Rififi"", this American communist plays an Italian safe-cracker and turns in an enormously convincing performance of a role he seems born to play. Here, he plays, well, an American communist and is as mis-cast as anyone could be in his own movie. Strange things happen when you don't have Joe McCarthy breathing down your neck.All in all, this comedy ranks with such gems as ""The Apartment"" and ""Some Like it Hot"" as a throwback to a past era in the world of cinema that has moved beyond being dated to the realm of the classics. The visual and sound quality and the range of language and subtitle options are all very satisfactory.

She plays Illia, the most sensuous and radiant ""lady of the night"" in the seaport Pyres where every man adores her and she is the one who chooses her partners. Mercouri was 40 years old when she played Illia but she did not hide a single day of her age and she was gorgeous, full of the inner fire and absolutely irresistible. When the new Pygmalion, the intellectual American named Homer (of course) sails into the town and meets Illia, he decides that his search for meaning of life would end in Pyres if he would reform Illia and make her change her way of life. With all his intellect and education he couldn't understand a very simple truth about Illia - only true love might change her. Homer played by director/writer Jules Dassin is the weakest part of this mostly charming comedy. I agree with one of the IMDb commenters who said that ""Jules Dassin has directed a great movie but he should have hired an actor to play Homer, and not played it himself... A better actor might have found a way around the rough spots but Dassin magnifies them.""

The men of her Greek harbor town adore her free-spirited and fun-loving nature. Her carefree world is about to change thanks to a bookish American named Homer (Jules Dassin). Homer is in Greece to find the meaning of life and to understand why the glorious Greek culture of ancient time came crashing to an end.Illia becomes his muse and inspiration. You see, Illia is a ""working girl"" and in Homer's eyes, it's women like Illia and her clients that brought the ancient Greek culture to an end. The premise is a bit silly but interesting as Homer tries to break Illia and make her an ""honest"" woman. He asks for just two weeks to transform her, yet does Illia need a make-over? She is kind and free-spirited and loves life. She loves to watch plays of ancient Greek Tragedies where everyone is good and there is always a happy ending with a visit to the seashore. Such gentle innocence upsets Homer and he vows to set her straight on all levels. No surprise that it is really Homer who needs a lesson on life.NEVER ON SUNDAY gives an idyllic look at Greek life in 1960. The modern world is encroaching on the sleepy harbor town yet the simple joys of Greek life centering around ouzo and dancing still dominate the town. The more glasses a dancing Greek man breaks in a tavern the happier he is. It's a simplified version of life but fun. ""Mr. No Face"" is the bad guy in town. All the ""working girls"" live in the apartments he owns and pay excessive rent. Only Illia is free-spirited enough to evade his control. Homer innocently joins forces with Mr. No Face to break Illia of her lively ways.The other working girls look up to Illia and admire her. She can influence them to break free of Mr. No Face's control. I enjoyed the scenes of 4 girls walking arm in arm but seen pretty much from the waist down--tight 60's knee length skirts, high heels and a determined brisk walk. They are seen walking on several occasions and an attractive voluptuous woman is their spokesperson to Illia. I wish we had seen more of her.NEVER ON SUNDAY does not fully hold up to the test of time. It seems somewhat dated and rather tame by today's standards. The DVD included the original theatrical trailer where the announcer says he can't say what Illia does for a living but you can guess. It must have caused a bit of stir in 1960.

""Never On Sunday"" is fine the way it is. A simple, intoxicating tale of an American writer named Homer (director Jules Dassin) who comes to the Greek isle of Piraeus to write and study the Greek culture. He is amazed at the laid back, carefree lifestyle he sees and the seemingly amoral ways of the local shipbuilders and fishermen. To them, drinking, partying and prostitution isn't bad---it's a fact of life, a necessity. They worship the local independent prostitute Illia (Melina Mercouri) who makes them all happy. She never sets prices and chooses only the ones she likes.  She's as wonderful, exuberant and exotic as the Greek isles themselves. Homer cannot believe she's actually a (gasp) hooker and sets out to do the Pygmalian thing with her---educate her and ""free"" her from her lifestyle. But she is clearly happy with her life and sees nothing wrong with it. Homer has his job cut out for him.  But the local bad guy Mr.No Face, who owns the local apartment row and overcharges the prostitutes who live there, wants Illia's business which she refuses to give. He cuts a deal with Homer---two weeks to educate her and get her out of business or else. But of course nothing goes exactly right. ""Never On Sunday"" is sexy, happy and romantic. The bouzouki music is infectious and won an Oscar in 1960 for film score. Everybody drinks ouzo and dances and sings and vies for Illia's favors. The location filmed cinematography is beautiful. The story is lyrical, like the music, and bittersweet. Dassin is wonderful as Homer, a ga-ga eyed intellectual naif with only the best intentions.  But it's Mercouri as Illia who IS ""Never on Sunday"". She is spectacular as the earthy, wise, good-hearted earthmother/... who can teach intellectuals a thing or two about life. She knows the Greek Tragedies and can tell their stories at the drop of a hat---HER versions: ""all these bad things happened and then everyone was happy and went to the seashore"". But that's Illia and that's ""Never On Sunday"". A joyous, harmless slice of happiness you can watch again and again. The DVD print is crystal clear and sharp and the sound perfect for all the bouzouki music you'll be humming for days afterward. The spirit of this film is ""ENJOY"". So, please do.

This, of course, was way before the era of the giant multiplex and the huge emphasis on opening weekend grosses. It was also a time when the median age of moviegoers was higher. Foreign films were popular, and subtitles were almost trendy. The movie was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Actress [Melina Mecouri, who won the award at Cannes], Best Director [Jules Dassin], Best Screenplay [also Dassin] and Best Costume Design [Theoni V. Aldredge]. Its sole win was for Best Song [Manos Hadjidakis]. I mention all this because the movie has fallen into obscurity, and I wanted the reader to know that it was considered more than a mere trifle of a comedy in its day. As far as I am concerned, it remains almost as fresh and sparkling as ever. Considered to be risqu&eacute; and even shocking forty years ago, this tale of an exuberant, full of life Greek prostitute and the stuffy, high-minded American who tries to change her may be tame by today's standards, but it also has a timeless quality to it. After all, the war between the free-spirited and the conservative still rages on.Melina Mecouri was one of the most beautiful, earthy and mesmerizing actresses ever to grace the screen. Jules Dassin, a very good director, was her husband. It's obvious that he wrote the movie for her. They later successfully collaborated on the delightful comedy ""Topkapi"" [available on DVD and VHS] and not so successfully on a modern version of the Greek tragedy ""Phaedra"" [not available in either format.]By the way, ""Never on Sunday"" predates by four years the famous ""Zorba the Greek"" [available only on VHS], starring Anthony Quinn and Alan Bates.

299946,ATLZNVLYKP9AZ,6302180279,T. Fisher,"[3, 3]","This movie is a classic, and justifiably so. At the same time, it's easy to criticize this 1960 film from the standpoint of today's morality for the romanticized portrayal of the lifestyle of its main character, the Piraeus prostitute Ilya.The central dramatic conflict is between the live-for-today attitude of the happy hooker Ilya, and the stifled, overintellectualizing bent of the male lead, the ironically named American tourist Homer -- stiffly played by the film's writer-director, Jules Dassin.This underlying conflict is the film's saving grace. The film is really not all that dissimilar to ""Zorba"" (which came later, in 1964) in terms of its message, and the bouzouki music and drunken Greek dances strengthen the sense of parallels between the two. The live-for-today mindset wins out, but still, Ilya does briefly achieve a deeper happiness when she gives Homer's bookish ways a try.I'm not sure that romanticizing the prostitute's lifestyle is the best way for a film to go. I think most people today would say it isn't, but what do I know -- maybe things were different in Greece in 1960. If you can hold back your probably justified indignation, this movie has some worthwhile things to say.There are a lot of jokes and references to ancient Greek history and culture. For example, the prostitutes of Piraeus go on strike for better living conditions, which I'm sure is a reference to the Aristophanes play ""Lysistrata"", in which the women of Greece withhold sex from their men until they agree to stop the Peloponnesian War. Also, the poet Homer was traditionally said to be blind -- just as the film's Homer is figuratively blind to the simple pleasures of life. I'm sure there many more Greek references I didn't pick up on.On an even more obscure note, the film's story has interesting parallels with the opera ""Thas"" by Jules Massenet: the prostitute-priestess (and that description fits Ilya perfectly as well) converts, becomes a nun, and is much happier for it. The difference is that Thas dies a happy nun, but here, the happy hooker returns.

When she did the take off on NEVER ON SUNDAY, Burnett's Illia did all that Mercouri's Illia did in the movie, but the lines matched those of a young school teacher collecting money for supplies rather than those of a prostitute. The skit piqued my interest in this film and could hardly wait a while until I saw it on video, since I was probably only ten when the Carol Burnett skit first aired.Perhaps what gives the movie its appeal is the fact that Illia, a gorgeous Greek prostitute is not the stereotype of a prostitute. She is not a miserable waif in need of salvation. She is a free spirit who cannot, or perhaps better stated, will not be tamed. The role is played masterfully by Melina Mercouri who won an award at Cannes for her performance. Homer, the American writer who wants her for himself is played by Jules Dassin. The film is set in a small Greek fishing village after World War II amend the locals give the film a great deal of flavor. There is plenty of Bouzouki music and Illia sings a rather seductive version of the well known theme song.The DVD has a trailer for the original film. In some ways the commercial for this film is humorous since it has very little to do with the actual plot, but I suppose since this film was so risqu&eacute; in its day, the trailer had to be vague.Since the film is in black and white, it has a historic flair, but the tale itself is timeless, which makes this a true all time classic.",5,An All Time Classic With A Great Score,1073174400,"01 4, 2004",2004,1561,"['When', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'show', 'was', 'television', 'had', 'skit', 'foreign', 'films', 'where', 'stories', 'were', 'mistranslated', 'When', 'did', 'take', 'off', 'NEVER', 'ON', 'SUNDAY', 'Burnett', 'Illia', 'did', 'Mercouri', 'Illia', 'did', 'movie', 'lines', 'matched', 'young', 'school', 'teacher', 'collecting', 'money', 'supplies', 'rather', 'prostitute', 'skit', 'piqued', 'interest', 'film', 'could', 'hardly', 'wait', 'while', 'saw', 'video', 'was', 'probably', 'only', 'ten', 'when', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'skit', 'first', 'what', 'movie', 'appeal', 'fact', 'Illia', 'gorgeous', 'Greek', 'prostitute', 'not', 'stereotype', 'prostitute', 'not', 'miserable', 'waif', 'need', 'salvation', 'free', 'spirit', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'perhaps', 'better', 'stated', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'tamed', 'role', 'played', 'masterfully', 'Melina', 'Mercouri', 'who', 'won', 'award', 'Cannes', 'performance', 'Homer', 'American', 'writer', 'who', 'played', 'Jules', 'Dassin', 'film', 'set', 'small', 'Greek', 'fishing', 'village', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'amend', 'locals', 'give', 'film', 'great', 'deal', 'flavor', 'plenty', 'Bouzouki', 'music', 'Illia', 'rather', 'seductive', 'version', 'well', 'known', 'theme', 'song.The', 'DVD', 'trailer', 'original', 'film', 'ways', 'commercial', 'film', 'humorous', 'very', 'little', 'do', 'actual', 'plot', 'suppose', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'risqu', 'eacute', 'day', 'trailer', 'had', 'be', 'film', 'black', 'white', 'historic', 'flair', 'tale', 'timeless', 'true', 'time', 'classic']",N/A

299950,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,6302180279,Westley,"[1, 1]","Melina Mercouri stars as Ilya, a Greek prostitute who charms everyone she meets.  Ilya is the fabled ""hooker with a heart of gold"" who enjoys her work and has throngs of customers who respect and adore her.  Yes, it sounds like a (twisted) fairy tale, but Melina is so good in this role that it succeeds surprisingly well.  The plot is thrown into action when she meets Homer, a dense American tourist played by the film's director (and later Mercouri's live-in love), Jules Dassin.  Homer is smitten with Ilya but believes that she can be so much more; plus, he kind of wants Ilya for himself.  So he embarks on a plan to make her into a lady.  Yes, the movie cribs shamelessly from ""Pygmalion,"" but it adds enough sauciness to make us forget that movie quickly.  Ilya's transformation is rapid and not too drastic, helping keep the film breezy and brief.  Will Ilya end up a cultured bride for Homer or continue her ways as a free-spirited prostitute?The film score was wildly popular at the time, with the familiar instrumental title song winning the Oscar for composer Manos Hatzidakis.  The song makes use of the unique sounding bouzouki, which is similar to a mandolin.  Mecouri also sings a version of the song in the movie, and it later was remade by numerous 60s stars, including Connie Francis and Petula Clark.  You'll be humming the song for days after watching ""Never on Sunday.""However, the true star is the leading lady.  Mercouri was nominated for an Oscar for her role; she lost to Elizabeth Taylor (who also played a hooker in the atrocious ""Butterfield 8"") but became an international star in the process.  She made movies and starred in plays for the next two decades before ending up in politics; she was eventually voted into the Hellenic Parliament and became Greece's Minister for Culture.  Although she made relatively few movies during her career, her work in ""Never on Sunday"" is memorable enough to cement her place in cinema history.",5,"""But never ever on a Sunday a Sunday a Sunday, cause that's my day of rest""",1233360000,"01 31, 2009",2009,1962,"['Melina', 'Mercouri', 'Ilya', 'Greek', 'prostitute', 'who', 'everyone', 'Ilya', 'fabled', 'hooker', 'heart', 'gold', 'who', 'work', 'throngs', 'customers', 'who', 'respect', 'adore', 'Yes', 'twisted', 'fairy', 'tale', 'Melina', 'so', 'good', 'role', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'plot', 'thrown', 'action', 'when', 'Homer', 'dense', 'American', 'tourist', 'played', 'film', 'director', 'later', 'Mercouri', 'live-in', 'love', 'Jules', 'Dassin', 'Homer', 'smitten', 'Ilya', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'kind', 'Ilya', 'So', 'plan', 'make', 'lady', 'Yes', 'movie', 'cribs', 'shamelessly', 'Pygmalion', 'enough', 'sauciness', 'make', 'forget', 'movie', 'quickly', 'Ilya', 'transformation', 'rapid', 'not', 'too', 'drastic', 'helping', 'keep', 'film', 'breezy', 'brief', 'Will', 'Ilya', 'end', 'up', 'cultured', 'bride', 'Homer', 'continue', 'ways', 'free-spirited', 'prostitute', 'film', 'score', 'was', 'wildly', 'popular', 'time', 'familiar', 'instrumental', 'title', 'song', 'winning', 'Oscar', 'composer', 'Manos', 'Hatzidakis', 'song', 'use', 'unique', 'sounding', 'bouzouki', 'similar', 'mandolin', 'Mecouri', 'also', 'version', 'song', 'movie', 'later', 'was', 'remade', 'numerous', '60s', 'stars', 'including', 'Connie', 'Francis', 'Petula', 'Clark', ""'ll"", 'be', 'humming', 'song', 'days', 'watching', 'Never', 'Sunday', 'However', 'true', 'star', 'leading', 'lady', 'Mercouri', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'role', 'lost', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'who', 'also', 'played', 'hooker', 'atrocious', 'Butterfield', '8', 'became', 'international', 'star', 'process', 'made', 'movies', 'starred', 'plays', 'next', 'two', 'decades', 'ending', 'up', 'politics', 'was', 'eventually', 'voted', 'Hellenic', 'Parliament', 'became', 'Greece', 'Minister', 'Culture', 'made', 'relatively', 'few', 'movies', 'career', 'work', 'Never', 'Sunday', 'memorable', 'enough', 'cement', 'place', 'cinema', 'history']",N/A
