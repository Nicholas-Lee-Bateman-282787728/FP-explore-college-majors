Trevino ""gaming gadget geek""","[4, 4]","Merlin is a Classic Sam Neill and everyone else in this cast including Helena Bonham Carter, Martin Short and Natasha Richardson are excellent with solid direction from Steve Barron. A wonderful telling of a King Arthur tale best one since Excalibur. Jason and the Argonauts has a feel of authenticity with some good special visual effects and interesting unconventional cast adding to its greatness. Some films are so good because they have popular comepetent actors but often come off as being to commercial both of these movies have something rare both well known and not so well known actors and everyone comes to the table to do a good job to create a fantasy and both directors including Emmy Winner Nick Willing succeed these should be in everyones collection and at this price for both Movies its a No Brainer its to bad we dont' get a widescreen treatment but still worthwile and Get the Special Widescreen Edition of Gullivers Travels with Ted Danson its super wonderful film transfer and sound and just forget the Jack Black travesty.",4,This is a Great Buy Two Extremely good Mini Series,1316476800,"09 20, 2011",2011,1045,"['Merlin', 'Classic', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'everyone', 'else', 'cast', 'including', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'Martin', 'Short', 'Natasha', 'Richardson', 'are', 'excellent', 'solid', 'direction', 'Steve', 'Barron', 'wonderful', 'telling', 'King', 'Arthur', 'tale', 'best', 'one', 'Excalibur', 'Jason', 'Argonauts', 'feel', 'authenticity', 'good', 'special', 'visual', 'effects', 'interesting', 'unconventional', 'cast', 'adding', 'greatness', 'films', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'have', 'popular', 'comepetent', 'actors', 'often', 'come', 'off', 'being', 'commercial', 'movies', 'have', 'something', 'rare', 'well', 'known', 'not', 'so', 'well', 'known', 'actors', 'everyone', 'table', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'create', 'fantasy', 'directors', 'including', 'Emmy', 'Winner', 'Nick', 'Willing', 'succeed', 'should', 'be', 'everyones', 'collection', 'price', 'Movies', 'No', 'Brainer', 'bad', 'dont', 'get', 'widescreen', 'treatment', 'still', 'worthwile', 'Get', 'Special', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'Gullivers', 'Travels', 'Ted', 'Danson', 'super', 'wonderful', 'film', 'transfer', 'sound', 'just', 'forget', 'Jack', 'Black', 'travesty']",N/A

Jason was better than the 60s and 70s versions of the same tale, and yet this might have been a better story with a big picture budget.  Merlin was much more fun and a bit more entertaining, but again, its limitations was in special effects.

1394252,A1M0OSCFOAMAZO,B004B93RDS,taaj,"[0, 0]","Jason & The Argonauts is a great piece of historical fiction that should be shared. There are many (any?) movies out there that tell this story so I was glad to be able to share it with some kids who recently got turned on to Classical mythology through the Percy Jackson movies. It paints Jason as a purely good guy and ignores the Medea tragedy. I think it makes a better story to leave that in. It's still an enjoyable, rated G show though. It looks a bit dated, but is still delightful. The acting is tv acting (meaning a bit over the top). Jason is the weakest link, but even with that it's still entertaining.Merlin also has a dated, made-for-tv look about it. It has a stellar cast and a lot better acting than Jason, but still a bit over the top. The story includes many of the elements of legend so I think fans of King Arthur, the Knights of the Round Table, and Camelot will be pleased. It's rated G and suitable for kids. None of this dark, sex, and violence stuff from the Camelot series. It also is very different from the light, fun BBC series Merlin.",4,Affordable Entertainment,1398211200,"04 23, 2014",2014,1066,"['Jason', 'Argonauts', 'great', 'piece', 'historical', 'fiction', 'should', 'be', 'shared', 'are', 'many', 'movies', 'out', 'there', 'that', 'tell', 'story', 'so', 'was', 'glad', 'be', 'able', 'share', 'kids', 'who', 'recently', 'got', 'turned', 'Classical', 'mythology', 'Percy', 'Jackson', 'movies', 'Jason', 'purely', 'good', 'guy', 'Medea', 'tragedy', 'think', 'better', 'story', 'leave', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'rated', 'G', 'show', 'bit', 'dated', 'still', 'delightful', 'acting', 'tv', 'acting', 'meaning', 'bit', 'top', 'Jason', 'weakest', 'link', 'even', 'still', 'entertaining.Merlin', 'also', 'dated', 'made-for-tv', 'look', 'stellar', 'cast', 'lot', 'better', 'acting', 'Jason', 'still', 'bit', 'top', 'story', 'many', 'elements', 'legend', 'think', 'fans', 'King', 'Arthur', 'Knights', 'Round', 'Table', 'Camelot', 'will', 'be', 'pleased', 'rated', 'G', 'suitable', 'kids', 'None', 'dark', 'sex', 'violence', 'stuff', 'Camelot', 'series', 'also', 'very', 'different', 'light', 'fun', 'BBC', 'series', 'Merlin']",N/A
