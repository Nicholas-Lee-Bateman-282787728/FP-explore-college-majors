The ending is a nice touch, and is actually very original in how it's presented. At first I thought it was rather tasteless, and making everyone look horrible, but later it makes more sense; maybe none of them really knew how to respect and value themselves, and that's what caused the trouble in the first place. If you can stick it out through the grimaces, and some genuine laughs, in the end you will feel better about everybody involved. Certainly better evening entertainment than your average blockbuster fodder.p.s. There seems to be a polarizing aspect to this film, drawing strong reactions from reviewers. I suspect it has to do with the sex, which, although limited to one scene and presenting no actual nudity, goes against certain social mores. It also presents its characters' flaws in a way that can be cringe-worthy at times. Again, I almost didn't watch it to the end, but was glad I did. Themes many seemed to have missed are transformation and new endings: Is it possible to write a new ending to your life, no matter how habitual and constricting it may have become? Can you just walk out of a life story that doesn't fit you anymore, and never look back?

1640973,A3KR1LCPRZOQ8P,B00BY8DHQ6,C. Pace,"[1, 3]","We all fall into the trap of picking movies inhabited by our favorite actors. Julianne Moore (The Big Lebowski, The Kids Are Alright, Children of Men) is a favorite of mine, and so when the English Teacher made its debut it became first in my movie queue. What a mistake. The movie's plot and script are trite, predictable, and uni-dimensional and its A-lister roster which include Broadway thespian Nathan Lane (The Birdcage) and always funnyman(although not so here) Greg Kinnear (Little Miss Sunshine, As Good As It Gets) and Michael Angarano (Almost Famous, Red State, The Forbidden Kingdom)can do nothing to save this 93-minute yawn fest. The story revolves around a dedicated but dull English teacher who, unlucky in love, throws her passion into the development of her students' lives (thought this cliche about English teachers ended with Diane Keeton's Looking for Mr. Goodbar).  When former student Angarano reunites with her at an ATM, Moore mistakes him for a mugger and subdues him with blasts of pepper spray. She learns that lIfe (on off Broadway) has been unkind to him and that he returns to the embrace of his small town with unpublished script in hand.  In her e finds an ever faithful cheerleader who champions his talent and doesn't resist his sexual advances which result in classroom seduction (where else, but on the school marm's desk).  Of course her straight laced feathers are ruffled (and titillated), and it isn't exactly non self-interest that causes her to take this floundering student under her wing.  She talks the high school powers that be into producing his play and the movie fun is supposed to begin, but merely takes a nose dive going forward. The plot would not have been so bad if the characters hadn't been scripted so poorly. Moore as the mousy English teacher, Kinnear as a controlling father (he wants his son to drop the whole Broadway thing and just go to law school), Lane as the artsy but failed drama teacher (Lane plays to type), and Angarano as the misunderstood student/author might all go down a bit easier with a big bowl of popcorn and a brew.

1640977,A1LACH6MLQWZ,B00BY8DHQ6,Doug Erlandson,"[1, 2]","&#34;The English Teacher,&#34; as the name implies, is about a high-school English teacher (Julianne Moore), a forty-something unmarried woman whose life is totally devoted to her work. Due to a chance meeting at an ATM one evening, she encounters a former student who's barely half her age and whom she recognizes only after she sprays pepper spray in his face. This is one of the funnier moments of the movie, one that is close to being slapstick. However, the movie takes a somewhat more serious tone when the English teacher becomes committed to the play that her former student (an aspiring playwright) has written and spearheads a crusade to use it for the semi-annual high school production.From this point on the movie takes us through a series of misadventures, in which she and her former student have a brief but decidedly unromantic sexual encounter in her classroom, her ex-student and the lead character in the play become romantically involved, and her brief liaison becomes public knowledge in the school. All this takes place against the background of an attempt on the part of the school administration to change the ending of the play, because as written it is too &#34;dark&#34; for a high-school production.What I found most interesting is that in the end all of the main characters come across as being flawed people, driven by their particular agendas, which is pretty much what drives the plot of the movie. As a result, it is hard to identify a character who is truly likable (or for that matter, truly unlikable). Moreover, despite the conflict that arises from these conflicting agendas and all the hurt feelings that result, somehow everything gets neatly and quickly tied up at the end and everyone is living happily ever after.All in all, if you treat it for what it is&#8211;&#8211;a fairly lighthearted movie that isn't quite realistic&#8211;&#8211;it will provide you with an hour and a half of decent entertainment.

1640978,AOZGOFPVAUMTB,B00BY8DHQ6,Doug Park,"[0, 0]","Julianne Moore gives a memorable performance as Linda Sinclair, a stodgily cool, attractively nerdy high school English teacher who finds herself in a compromising position with a talented former student whose play she's promoting  to the school's administration and Thespians. While I loled once or twice, most of the consistent humor is of a drier, more satirical variety. This film does a nice job of compassionately satirizing a number of institutions and stereotypes, and this is one English teacher that really knows how to keep at least some of the class's attention without asking them to think too hard.Notwithstanding the mock Masterpiece Theater narrator, THE ENGLISH TEACHER is quite light comedy in the end, without a lot of character depth or conflict development. Though it's pretty tame stuff and looks like it could be rather uneventful, plenty happens throughout its short (90-minute) length.Not to sound snooty, elitist, or anything else, but it seems that someone would need one and preferably both of the following in order to really enjoy THE ENGLISH TEACHER:A) Some familiarity with the world of Secondary Education, its various workplace clich&eacute;s (""Just take it down one level, please,"" etc), and sensitive legalities--admin's concern about the possibility of a lawsuit if they allow the students to put on a play that ends in bloody murder, etc.B) Some familiarity with (and interest in?) classic American and British literature. While the frequent allusions are nothing heavy, it helps to know a little about who Lord Byron was, the basic plot of Thornton Wilder's OUR TOWN, and so forth.I strongly recommend this film to anyone who falls under those categories, particularly those who teach English. Some current high school students (and parents) with relatively sedate tastes may also like it. Those outside these perimeters may be rather bored by THE ENGLISH TEACHER.Nothing really wild happens beyond some implied sex, a lot of realistic profanity, and generally sensitive subject matter.",4,"""Do you REALLY think you affect their lives by reading them Emerson?!""",1397260800,"04 12, 2014",2014,2025,"['Julianne', 'Moore', 'memorable', 'performance', 'Linda', 'Sinclair', 'stodgily', 'cool', 'attractively', 'nerdy', 'high', 'school', 'English', 'teacher', 'who', 'compromising', 'position', 'talented', 'former', 'student', 'play', 'promoting', 'school', 'administration', 'Thespians', 'loled', 'once', 'twice', 'most', 'consistent', 'humor', 'drier', 'more', 'satirical', 'variety', 'film', 'nice', 'job', 'compassionately', 'satirizing', 'number', 'institutions', 'stereotypes', 'one', 'English', 'teacher', 'really', 'how', 'keep', 'least', 'class', 'attention', 'asking', 'think', 'too', 'hard.Notwithstanding', 'mock', 'Masterpiece', 'Theater', 'narrator', 'ENGLISH', 'TEACHER', 'quite', 'light', 'comedy', 'end', 'lot', 'character', 'depth', 'conflict', 'development', 'pretty', 'tame', 'stuff', 'could', 'be', 'rather', 'uneventful', 'plenty', 'short', '90-minute', 'length.Not', 'sound', 'snooty', 'elitist', 'anything', 'else', 'someone', 'would', 'need', 'one', 'preferably', 'following', 'order', 'really', 'enjoy', 'THE', 'ENGLISH', 'TEACHER', 'familiarity', 'world', 'Secondary', 'Education', 'various', 'workplace', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Just', 'take', 'down', 'one', 'level', 'please', 'etc', 'sensitive', 'legalities', 'admin', 'concern', 'possibility', 'lawsuit', 'allow', 'students', 'put', 'play', 'bloody', 'murder', 'etc.B', 'familiarity', 'interest', 'classic', 'American', 'British', 'literature', 'frequent', 'allusions', 'are', 'nothing', 'heavy', 'know', 'little', 'who', 'Lord', 'Byron', 'was', 'basic', 'plot', 'Thornton', 'Wilder', 'OUR', 'TOWN', 'so', 'forth.I', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'categories', 'particularly', 'who', 'teach', 'English', 'current', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'parents', 'relatively', 'sedate', 'tastes', 'may', 'also', 'like', 'perimeters', 'may', 'be', 'rather', 'bored', 'ENGLISH', 'TEACHER.Nothing', 'really', 'wild', 'happens', 'implied', 'sex', 'lot', 'realistic', 'profanity', 'generally', 'sensitive', 'subject', 'matter']",The English Teacher

1640988,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00BY8DHQ6,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[9, 11]","For its A-list cast alone, I'm surprised that ""The English Teacher"" didn't get a wider distribution or more notoriety.  In my world, any time Julianne Moore headlines an indie film, it's time to take notice!  Here, Moore is joined by Greg Kinnear, Nathan Lane, Michael Angarano, and Lily Collins for a slight, but not unappealing, comedy about (you guessed it) an idealistic teacher.  In looking at some of the other notices, I must admit I'm absolutely shocked by the moral outrage that this film seems to have engendered in certain viewers.  The film is so lightweight, I'm just mystified that people have taken it so seriously.  Let's just put it this way: if you find the content of ""The English Teacher"" horrifying, then you must not watch TV, movies, the news, or have any knowledge of the real world.  The situations and plot lines in the film's screenplay are so far removed from reality, in fact, that I wonder what all the fuss is about.  Are teachers in movies supposed to be saints?  Anything else is unacceptable?  I don't subscribe to this philosophy, obviously, and have no issues with the primary plot points from a moral standpoint.Moore plays a steadfast English teacher.  Living in complete routine, she has all but given up on love.  When she encounters a former student (Angarano), her passion is channeled in a more artistic way.  He has failed to break into the theater world in New York, but she embraces his original play and attempts to have it produced at the local high school.  As she and director Lane battle school bureaucracy, the film devotes itself to the production.  Although this milieu is ripe for satire (Waiting for Guffman style), the movie never really swings for big laughs.  It's mildly amusing at best.  Moore has an indiscretion that threatens to derail the play, her career, and her life and the story takes on a rather mean spirited bent.  But never one to dwell on the serious for long, you know things are undoubtedly going to work out.  And as the play hits the stage, the moral of the lesson seems to be that it's OK to sell out your artistic integrity if the results are positive!  Yeah!I'll try to break down my feelings about the movie concisely.  My main issue with ""The English Teacher"" is that it can never really decide what it wants to be.  Is it a second chance romance?  Is it a satire of the high school theater scene?  Is it a character study about a woman searching for depth and meaning from life?  Is it a slapstick comedy?  Is it a tale of redemption?  The movie touches on all of these topics without ever really committing one way or another.  It's likable.  It's watchable.  But I wanted the comedy to be funnier or the drama to be more believable.  As is, this flight of fancy never approximates real world situations but never fully commits to its fantasy nature either.  It's pleasant and the cast is good, but it might have been something truly special!  That said, if you are a fan of Moore, she gives a great performance.  Angarano and Lane are also well cast, but Kinnear gets the movie's most underwritten part.  The movie has a lot of good ideas, but seems to want to please everyone with a lighthearted charm.  That's why I'm particularly stunned by the moral outrage, the movie is as inoffensive as can be because it constantly skirts away from any real drama.

1640990,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B00BY8DHQ6,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[2, 5]","THE ENGLISH TEACHER begins with a pleasant, British woman's voice narrating the back story of our lead character, an English teacher/spinster named Linda who has lived most of her life in books. The narrator describes Linda and her life in cutesy, tongue-in-cheek terms. I'm not really a fan of voice-overs -- they're one of the laziest elements that a scriptwriter can use -- but I figured this was an attempt to place the film along the border of a fantasy genre, to prepare the audience for a story that was meant mostly as a fable.What happens is that Linda, one night, meets up with an old student (Jason) who has been trying to become a playwright, but whose senior project has been rejected by every company he's sent it to. Linda offers to read the play, is touched deeply, and decides to put the production on at her high school. From here, she encounters staff members who are worried by the play's dark undertones, a director who can't stop spending her money, horny actresses, Jason's seemingly unsupportive father (Greg Kinnear being Greg Kinnear), as well as a -- whoops! -- sexual indiscretion with the playwright himself.In a movie where a disembodied British woman is narrating much of the action, it's important for the comedy to be in both the characters as well as the events, and unfortunately almost no one in this movie is either interesting or likeable, let alone both. Nathan Lane's director is the most enjoyable person to watch, but he disappears three-quarters of the way through in an awkwardly obvious plot contrivance that the movie doesn't even bother to apologize for (don't worry; he just as inexplicably reappears to take his part in the grand finale). Nearly every character seems to switch personalities multiple times and for very little reason at all. Jason, especially, is a pretty annoying guy, and although you only get to see/hear glints of his supposedly powerful play, none of those glimpses appear to belong to something especially unique or touching.I know that the film is meant to be a lighthearted throwaway -- all for fun, some might say -- but the characters and plotting are so schizophrenic that it feels like it's trying to be three different kinds of funny and cute at the same time, and the effect is jarring and overdone. I was going to give the film three stars until the penultimate scene, when Jason's play is finally performed and viewers are treated to their largest sample of the play, yet: the ending. It is composed of pretty much every hackneyed, trite, Hallmark-level cliche that you'll find in comedy romances, but the film treats it as if it is an overwhelming breakthrough for both the characters and the audience. At a moment where comedy would've been most appropriate, the movie goes for sincerity, and in the goopiest, schmaltziest way possible. It's like a cake that's 80% frosting. Sure, we all love frosting, but eat too much of it and you get sick. There should also be substance there, and this film pretty much has none. If you've got the stomach for the overly-sweet, you might like the film, but I ended it with a belly ache.",2,Three Kinds of Sugar On A Wafer-Thin Cake,1379894400,"09 23, 2013",2013,3108,"['ENGLISH', 'TEACHER', 'pleasant', 'British', 'woman', 'voice', 'narrating', 'back', 'story', 'lead', 'character', 'English', 'teacher/spinster', 'named', 'Linda', 'who', 'lived', 'most', 'life', 'books', 'narrator', 'Linda', 'life', 'cutesy', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'terms', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'fan', 'voice-overs', ""'re"", 'one', 'laziest', 'elements', 'scriptwriter', 'can', 'use', 'figured', 'was', 'attempt', 'place', 'film', 'border', 'fantasy', 'genre', 'prepare', 'audience', 'story', 'was', 'meant', 'mostly', 'fable.What', 'Linda', 'one', 'night', 'up', 'old', 'student', 'Jason', 'who', 'been', 'trying', 'become', 'playwright', 'senior', 'project', 'been', 'rejected', 'company', 'sent', 'Linda', 'read', 'play', 'touched', 'deeply', 'put', 'production', 'high', 'school', 'here', 'staff', 'members', 'who', 'are', 'worried', 'play', 'dark', 'undertones', 'director', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'spending', 'money', 'horny', 'actresses', 'Jason', 'seemingly', 'unsupportive', 'father', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'being', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'as', 'well', 'whoops', 'sexual', 'indiscretion', 'playwright', 'movie', 'where', 'disembodied', 'British', 'woman', 'narrating', 'much', 'action', 'important', 'comedy', 'be', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'events', 'unfortunately', 'almost', 'one', 'movie', 'either', 'interesting', 'likeable', 'let', 'alone', 'Nathan', 'Lane', 'director', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'person', 'watch', 'three-quarters', 'way', 'awkwardly', 'obvious', 'plot', 'contrivance', 'movie', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'apologize', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'just', 'inexplicably', 'take', 'part', 'grand', 'finale', 'Nearly', 'character', 'switch', 'personalities', 'multiple', 'times', 'very', 'little', 'reason', 'Jason', 'especially', 'pretty', 'annoying', 'guy', 'only', 'get', 'see/hear', 'glints', 'supposedly', 'powerful', 'play', 'none', 'glimpses', 'appear', 'belong', 'something', 'especially', 'unique', 'touching.I', 'know', 'film', 'meant', 'be', 'lighthearted', 'throwaway', 'fun', 'might', 'say', 'characters', 'plotting', 'are', 'so', 'schizophrenic', 'trying', 'be', 'three', 'different', 'kinds', 'funny', 'cute', 'same', 'time', 'effect', 'jarring', 'overdone', 'was', 'going', 'give', 'film', 'three', 'stars', 'penultimate', 'scene', 'when', 'Jason', 'play', 'finally', 'performed', 'viewers', 'are', 'treated', 'largest', 'sample', 'play', 'yet', 'ending', 'composed', 'pretty', 'much', 'hackneyed', 'trite', 'Hallmark-level', 'cliche', ""'ll"", 'find', 'comedy', 'romances', 'film', 'overwhelming', 'breakthrough', 'characters', 'audience', 'moment', 'where', 'comedy', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'most', 'appropriate', 'movie', 'sincerity', 'goopiest', 'schmaltziest', 'way', 'possible', 'cake', '80', '%', 'frosting', 'Sure', 'love', 'frosting', 'eat', 'too', 'much', 'get', 'sick', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'substance', 'there', 'film', 'pretty', 'much', 'none', ""'ve"", 'got', 'stomach', 'overly-sweet', 'might', 'like', 'film', 'ended', 'belly', 'ache']",The English Teacher

It's a send-up of Middle-American morality, but it never succeeds in becoming anything more than a pleasant little film.I invoked the overused cliche for my review title because that's the well from which this little drama springs.  It is the thwarted desires of the English teacher (Julianne Moore) and the drama teacher (Nathan Lane) which drive them to produce the corny, but mildly promising script by the former student (and spoiled brat) played by Michael Angarano.  The play in question is called ""The Chrysalis"", which in itself is kind of a corny metaphor for high school.... the place which is supposed to incubate successes (and largely produces failures.)  Michael Angarano's ""Jason"" appeals to the deeply ingrained sense of inferiority in his former teachers... and at one point, he honestly reveals his contempt for them, to Moore's character.  By that point, Moore's English teacher is experiencing an unrelenting fall from grace largely because of Jason's manipulations.Moore and Lane are basically what makes this film watchable, and Moore in particular.  She is excellent in her comedic portrayal of a repressed (but still attractive) middle-aged woman who is a victim of her own politically correct nature.  In fact Moore is so good, she will probably remind you of at least one person that you know.This movie reminded me of both ""Waiting For Guffman"" and ""Election"" in its close to the bone portrayals of small town personalities, and high school viciousness.

I was at the library the other day and I noticed it on the shelf, read the synopsis on the back, and who was in the cast, and I brought it home.  Today I watched it and was completely taken in!The story is about an unmarried high school English teacher who is very passionate about her job so much so that even in her spare time she is surrounded by books and novels of writers and even her social life is wrapped up in the lives of the people in books.  Enter a former student, Jason, a recent graduate of NYU who has written a play that no one wants to not only read but perform.  Eager to help, Linda(played by Julianne Moore) persuades the administration to put on the play using high school students.  The drama teacher, Carl, kind of a flamboyant guy who didn't quite make it as an actor, is only too enthusiastic.  Nathan Lane is cast as Carl and excels in the part as he goes about making this production into something that Broadway would envy---it's even more evident as the costs mount up!  By the way Linda is footing the bill!Things start to go haywire when there is some romantic and sexual feelings happening on the set that involve Linda, the leading lady, and Jason.  Then to throw the wrench in all of this is Jason's dad,  played by Greg Kinnear, a successful doctor who thinks his son should have a more worthwhile career.  There is a lot of miscommunication, Linda's reputation is at stake, and a minor accident causes all this to come to a head.  Will the play go on in it's original form?  Will Linda keep her job?  Is Jason's dad the tyrant he is made out to be?All the roles in this movie were very well played.  I wasn't familiar with Michael Angarano who played Jason but he really captured the raw emotions of someone trying to write, becoming emotionally involved with not only producing his play but with the players and also getting along with his dad.

1641000,A13D4E28S63SYF,B00BY8DHQ6,"Ron ""true faith""","[2, 5]","I agree with you that the characters in THE ENGLISH TEACHER got it backwards by overlooking a 25-year-old playwright making out with an ""underage"" high school student, and condemning a ""legal"" 40-year-old English teacher doing the same thing with the playwright.  But, wasn't that the point of the movie?  To show you how things are not always what they appear.  At that point in the movie, almost everyone thought the English teacher was a horrible person and the playwright was an angel.  Why?  Because she made out with her former student, who she also lied to about the ending of his play.  But then we later find out that the playwright/former student isn't so wonderful after all.  He took the easy way out for the ending of his play as he did in his real life.  He lied to his father about going to law school.  And he made out with an underage student.  All very immature and childish behavior.  Suddenly, the tables are turned around and by the time we get to the end of the movie--we have a little bit more respect and compassion for the English teacher.  Yes, maybe she didn't handle the whole play production very well--but at least she tried and did the best that she could.  And somehow she realized that's what the playwright's father tried to do too.  And the playwright--well, he just comes across as a problem child.  IMO viewers should not see THE ENGLISH TEACHER about a teacher and her former student.  They should see it as a film about PARENTING because that's what the English teacher and playwright's father were trying to do.

(I sure did!). Julianne Moore and Nathan Lane are just two of the names and you can add Greg Kinnear (""As Good as It Gets"""")  Nikki Blonsky (Hairspray) to the list. As you will find out on unusually long 27-minute ""Making Of"" Featurette (which features interviews with much of the cast and excepts from rehearsals - rather than the usual clips from the film you just saw) this was a really low-budget ""independent"" film which was made from start to finish in under a year. It was filmed in New York City and the nearby Hudson Valley (subbing for a fictitious town in Pennsylvania) which allowed it to get both Broadway acting talent and Broadway set designers (essential for the ""play within a play"" which is one of the fun parts of this 93-minute film.But I haven't even told you about the plot (and maybe this is the first review here that you are reading). We'll, if you've read my other reviews on Amazon, you know that I'm not a fan of ""spoilers"" and this is another film that the less you know about before you watch it, the better. So I'll suggest that you limit yourself  - for now - to short reviews. What I will tell you is that it is the story of local playwright whpo goes to New York where his play is rejected. He comes home and finds that his former ""English Teacher"" would like to have his premiere at the local high school. ThaT'S IT. That's all I'm going to tell you of the plot. If you like theater or if you have an interest in drama departments in high schools, I can recommend it even more. The twists and turns will bne better enjoyed if you don't know much more.In addition to the ""making of"" featurette I mentioned earlier, there is one deleted scene (which really isn't important and I'm glad it was deleted) and the Theatrical trailer. I'm told the same features appear on both the DVD and Bluray.I gave the film four stars - though it might go up to 4.5 - because there are a few story lines that are left hanging. To tell you more would give away too much. This film was obviously made with great love by folks who care. It's listed as a comedy though there is not much to laugh out loud at.
