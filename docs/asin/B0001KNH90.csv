This is a mystery & they do a great job of setting it up early. The longer the story goes on, the less likely the plot that is being revealed is. The final reveal is preposterous. The writer tried to hard on this one & it's a shame. The directorial talent & acting talent were available. The script was sub-par. 2 1/2 stars.",3,Coulda been more,1264377600,"01 25, 2010",2010,458,"['felt', 'James', 'Caan', 'deserved', 'A', 'portrayal', 'incompetent', 'building', 'super', 'Jen', 'Tilly', 'was', 'good', 'usual', 'so', 'why', 'only', '3', 'stars', 'mystery', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'setting', 'up', 'early', 'longer', 'story', 'less', 'likely', 'plot', 'being', 'revealed', 'final', 'reveal', 'preposterous', 'writer', 'tried', 'hard', 'one', 'shame', 'directorial', 'talent', 'acting', 'talent', 'were', 'available', 'script', 'was', 'sub-par', '2', '1/2', 'stars']",N/A

Not a problem.James has the ball and keeps it.Genevieve is crusty and stunning.Jennifer is Jennifer.A somewhat confusing and surreal piece of cinema that manages to progrssively lose your interest.

809158,A3FHVYIL6FYHXI,B0001KNH90,Laser Point,"[6, 7]","James Caan plays the live-in superintendant of a New York Apartment building who never leaves the premeses. His existance has been whittled down so that he has no experience of reality apart from the building. As the movie progresses, we learn that as a young man he was assaulted by his mother and her lover, leaving him with brain damage and loss of memory. It turns out that the apartment ""owner"" is none other than wicked stepmother who stole Caan's inheritance (the apartment building), his name and, in essence, his life.This is an unusual movie in that James Caan is not the masterful, decisive figure that viewers have come to expect. Here he portrays a confused, vulnerable, and ultimately enraged loser, who finally learns how his life came to be wasted through the machinations of others. His portrayal of a man who slowly realizes the enormity of his loss and identifies the agent of his destruction is brilliant. This is an interesting movie for anyone but if you are a James Caan fan this is a particular gem.",4,James Caan As You've Never Seen Him Before,1131753600,"11 12, 2005",2005,1023,"['James', 'Caan', 'live-in', 'superintendant', 'New', 'York', 'Apartment', 'building', 'who', 'never', 'premeses', 'existance', 'been', 'whittled', 'down', 'so', 'experience', 'reality', 'apart', 'building', 'movie', 'learn', 'young', 'man', 'was', 'assaulted', 'mother', 'lover', 'leaving', 'brain', 'damage', 'loss', 'memory', 'out', 'apartment', 'owner', 'none', 'other', 'wicked', 'stepmother', 'who', 'stole', 'Caan', 'inheritance', 'apartment', 'building', 'name', 'essence', 'life.This', 'unusual', 'movie', 'James', 'Caan', 'not', 'masterful', 'decisive', 'figure', 'viewers', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'Here', 'confused', 'vulnerable', 'ultimately', 'enraged', 'loser', 'who', 'finally', 'how', 'life', 'came', 'be', 'wasted', 'machinations', 'others', 'portrayal', 'man', 'who', 'slowly', 'enormity', 'loss', 'agent', 'destruction', 'brilliant', 'interesting', 'movie', 'anyone', 'are', 'James', 'Caan', 'fan', 'particular', 'gem']",N/A
809159,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B0001KNH90,Michael Butts,"[10, 10]","JERICHO MANSIONS is a complex, oftentimes frustrating, thriller set in a strange apartment complex in some large city.  James Caan, in a very good performance, plays Leonard Grey, the withdrawn manager who never goes outdoors.  One can tell from the beginning that there is more than meets the eye to this gentle, but strange, individual.  The complex is peopled with a wide assortment of eccentrics:  Genevieve Bujold, in a fierce and unusual performance, plays the owner of the building, who obviously has no like for her manager; Jennifer Tilly brings demure sexual steam to her role as the wife of a cheating husband who gets his head bashed in with a hammer.  The other tenants include a lonely woman who loves birds and a Spanish woman with an abusive husband.  Who killed the philandering husband?  Trust that nothing is as it seems in this well directed little chiller, and the ending, though a bit confusing, is not one you may expect.  From its weird and atmospheric cinematography to its bright color schemes, JERICHO MANSIONS is not your typical mystery, but one that may leave you wondering what you have just watched!",4,AND THE WALLS COME TUMBLING DOWN,1104796800,"01 4, 2005",2005,1131,"['JERICHO', 'MANSIONS', 'complex', 'oftentimes', 'frustrating', 'thriller', 'set', 'strange', 'apartment', 'complex', 'large', 'city', 'James', 'Caan', 'very', 'good', 'performance', 'Leonard', 'Grey', 'withdrawn', 'manager', 'who', 'never', 'outdoors', 'One', 'can', 'tell', 'beginning', 'more', 'eye', 'gentle', 'strange', 'individual', 'complex', 'peopled', 'wide', 'assortment', 'eccentrics', 'Genevieve', 'Bujold', 'fierce', 'unusual', 'performance', 'owner', 'building', 'who', 'obviously', 'manager', 'Jennifer', 'Tilly', 'demure', 'sexual', 'steam', 'role', 'wife', 'cheating', 'husband', 'who', 'head', 'bashed', 'hammer', 'other', 'tenants', 'include', 'lonely', 'woman', 'who', 'birds', 'Spanish', 'woman', 'abusive', 'husband', 'Who', 'killed', 'philandering', 'husband', 'Trust', 'nothing', 'well', 'directed', 'little', 'chiller', 'ending', 'bit', 'confusing', 'not', 'one', 'may', 'expect', 'weird', 'atmospheric', 'cinematography', 'bright', 'color', 'schemes', 'JERICHO', 'MANSIONS', 'not', 'typical', 'mystery', 'one', 'may', 'leave', 'wondering', 'what', 'have', 'just', 'watched']",N/A
