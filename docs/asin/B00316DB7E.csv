Even though we are still facing discrimination everyday within races, or religions, or status, or whatever else over ridiculous things. It is very good movie at the same time sad story.We are simply human beings, nothing else and we can't be higher than God no one can. Just enjoy the life that God has given us love and humanity are the greatest blessing that He has given us above creatures of the planet and below the seas. Human beings have more potentials, logic, communication systems and opportunities to create life through generation to generation. It is amazing what we are capable to do with life and at the same time life can be so complicated, so is love. No one cannot define love because it is so complicated and it is pure delivered from God and Jesus Christ as well, not men. As Son of Men and God, Jesus Christ who has died for us with love that we couldn't understand.

But I have to say, the Taviani brothers have made a strong albeit difficult to watch movie that takes the best of their unique style and incorporates it into a compelling narrative, which at all times serves the story.  I'll also admit to being partial because this is a story that hits close to home, as I'm a descendant of survivors of the Armenian Genocide.  But I've seen enough bad movies about the Genocide to know for sure when I""ve crossed paths with a really good one.  This is a really good one--arguably the best one that has a conventional narrative.[""Ararat"" from Atom Egoyan (Ararat) is a tremendous movie, but unfortunately it's a movie primarily for ""insiders"" only.  It's significantly inaccessible to those who aren't already familiar with Armenian diasporan life post-Genocide and who also lack a solid understanding of the outlines of the Genocide itself.  It's unfortunate that Egoyan didn't make an effort to make the film overly approachable, but I suspect that he believed that doing so would ""dumb it down"" and make it impossible for him to tell the story he wanted to tell in the running time he had to tell it.  For those who understand the backstory that Egoyan assumes the viewer already is up to speed on, ""Ararat"" is tremendous.]When I was watching ""The Lark Farm,""I have to admit, I was wondering, is this story really true, or has it been embellished to make for better cinema?  As I learned in subsequent research, sadly, it's a true story.  If I had known that going into the movie, it would have made the movie even more devastating than it actually was.This is a sad story.

And yet the Taviani Brothers (Kaos) seem to have done exactly that; they took a novel about the Armenian genocide of 1915 and turned it into... a romance. You can see where problems might arise here.Nunik (Vega) and Ferzan (Bleibtreu) are old friends. Ferzan's got a crush, of course, but could never let her know, because she's too good for him--her family is rich and famous, and he's just a cop. Nunik is Armenian, Ferzan is Turkish. All of this is happening in 1915, while underground groups are whipping Turkish nationalism into a frenzy (where it still exists today; even referring to the Armenian genocide within the country's borders can get you tossed in jail for the crime of ""insulting Turkishness"". No, I'm not making this up: google Elif Shafak's recent trial for that exact charge). Ferzan belongs to one of them, but as the language gets more and more violent, he starts thinking that perhaps he should warn Nunik's family and get them the hell out of town to their country estate (the Lark Farm that gives the English-language release its name). He does this--and then word gets out, leading to a huge procession of ethnic Armenians trying to get out of the city to seek refuge in the Lark Farm at the same time the Turks are attempting an ethnic cleansing. Panic, of course, ensues....and on top of all this, we have this romance subplot. I'm sure you can see where that was a good idea.Still, I have to give it that the directors, while taking every possible step wrong they could, are good at what they do, and it would be well-nigh impossible to mask the quality of this cast, so it's not a completely painful viewing experience (and one can never have too much Paz Vega)--but it is wrong in just about every way, and will leave you wondering what you just watched, and possibly why. ** ",3,Love in the Time of...

The motion picture was meticulously researched, with the  excellent direction and cinematography that we have learned to expect from Italian cinema.  The characters are believable and well-cast and the actors play their parts convincingly.There is a considerable amount of violence, so much so that I would have to rate this as one of the most violent motion pictures I have seen recently (I do not count the comic-book violence of recent Hollywood pictures).
