62316,A1ST1XBL6EQTBV,0783229593,HE WHO FUNKS BEHIND THE ROWS!!,"[2, 3]","Though this kind of story has been done to death on film& in literature, and is certainly nothing new in the history of""Gaydom"", where the fascination, infatuation, lust and longing for the Str8,buff, handsome, ultra masculine sexy college jock, cub, otter, or military manof gay dreams is still alive & well!Why do people always want the most what they can't have?An age-old question...but why?Why do otherwise intelligent & often accomplished gay men allowthemselves to be baited, taken in, consumed by their on lusts, manipulatedby their own loneliness and/or lack of self-worth into jumping for the Str8guy fantasy, which is always just out of their reach and will always end in heartache!It's a sad saga which has gone on since the dawn of recorded history andcontinues today in the internet age where the Str8 carrot is still beingdangled (pun intended) in front of the collective gay consciousness!All that having been said...Late one night, about 2 yrs ago, I was watching Showtime and came upon thismovie ""Love & Death On Long Island"" which was just beginning.John Hurt was amazing as the 19th Century-esque English writer (Giles De'Ath),a closeted gay man who was once married to a woman and is now widowed.He lives a sheltered exsistence in the guilded age, even though (in reality)it's the late 20th Century! He's completely out of touch with the modern world,lives in a stately manor, and is cared for by a maid, who occasionallygives him bits & pieces of what is going on in the real world.He doesn't even know what a VHS or a VCR is for god's sake! (-:Anybody who's familiar with the work of John Hurt knows that he is amaster of creating these odd duck / fish-out-of-water characters.You get a sense that his character is a very priggish, jaded and tired,once very lauded writer who's hey-day is far behind him.He has been in self-imposed seclusion for 20 yrs prior to the start of the story.Anywayz, in an attempt to connect with modern times and get somesemblence a life, he ventures to a local movie theatre where he finds,by pure chance because he actually went to see another film, but wentinside the wrong theatre, HIS NEW REASON FOR LIVING!!--In a very handsomebut otherwise forgettable actor, a kind of James Dean/ Johnny Depp knock off(named Ronnie Bostock), played adeptly by Jason Priestley, who stars in aseries of B-Rate, mindless, low-brow, frat house comedies alaPORKY'S/THE LAST AMERICAN VIRGIN/AMERICAN PIE.Hurt's character becomes instantly & madly infatuated with Priestley's characterto the point of unhealthy obsession!---He buys EVERY MOVIE that Priestley'scharacter is in and watches them over and over!---He fantasizes wildly like aschool girl over his rippling young body, his golden tawny mane of hair,his sexy deep brooding eyes, his pouty sullen ""dream boat"" demeanor....He paws over countless Hollywood magazines and other materials to learnas much about this Ronnie Bostock as he can!I mean, sure he thinks the dialogue and plots of his films are ridiculous,and his acting skills are marginal at best, but he deludes himself intothinking that with a little ""tutelege"" and the sage experience of an olderwiser wealthy learned man (himself), that this young virile greek god of anactor can realize his true potential as a master thespian of Olivier's proportions!(Ha!--The trips of the human mind!)So he decides to leave his sheltered, guilded, 19th Century world behindand move to (Chesterton) Long Island, NY, where he has found out thatthe object of his desire lives with his actress-model girlfriend, played by Fiona Leowi.He needs to, has to...be near him, touch him, breathe him in, HAVE HIM!!He must infiltrate his studly god-like world, vanquish the girlfriendand (in his most desperate of fantasies) make him see that whatTHEY SHARE is something which defies convention, but alas is DESTINY!!He does this slowly and methodically....first finding out where he lives,then falsely befriending the girlfriend, who he merely tolerates in orderto get closer to his goal, patiently plotting and mapping outin his sad & desperately delusional mind of the magical day when he willmeet his handsome prize, kick the girlfriend out of the beachfront condo,and live happily ever after....just the two of them and the dog! (-:Finally, he does meet Priestley's character and the two become friends.He flatters and cajoles his quarry, strokes his healthy ego, makes him feelmore talented than he actually is, makes promises to write an opus of ascript which will put him on another level as an actor, etc.But you also get a sense that Priestley's character isn't as naive as thecharacters he plays...yet he's intrigued by this strange older diminuitive britishscholarly man with his flowery language, who seems to say all the right thingsthat he (on some level) wants to hear.You also get a sense of the girlfriend not being as taken in by Hurt'scharacter's masquerade as she seems either. You get a sense that they areboth kind of letting him play himself out and reveal his true hand to them.Fast forward to the climactic scene in the diner where, after he and Priestley'scharacter have just spent a day of hanging out, talking, laughing, and drivingthe autumn backroads of Long Island together, he finally reveals the true natureof his interest in his young protege, his career and more!It's just Hurt and Priestley sitting together facing each other and thesubtle power of the scene is amazingly riveting!Hurt is very dismissive of Priestley's girlfriend's signifigance in his life,which you can see, really angers Priestley, but he keeps it in check.She really is a very nice and beautiful woman and has been reallycool & tolerant of Hurt's character....but to him, she's a mere pawn inhis game nonetheless.Let me just say that you definitely get to see what a really good actor thatJason Priestley is in this scene, because it's all in his facialexpressions and body language as he reacts to Hurt's character's disparagingrevealations. You see a sense of betrayal, dismay, a little disgust,seething anger at his manipulations and intentions...you almost thinkthat Priestley might even take a swing at him at one point.But then, you also see a sense of compassion, empathy & even pity in hisdemeanor that this poor lonely aging gay man is so empty & so desperatefor love in his miserable life that he actually moved a world away just totry to seduce his ideal vision of male perfection!So sad that he didn't really see Priestley's character as a real3-D human being with thoughts, feelings, a mind or a life of his own!He's just an objectified fantasy to him...he can't see the real guy inside.Priestley's character alas, lovingly rebuffs Hurt's character'saffection/intentions with a firm touch and squeeze on the shoulderas he exits his life for good!  Maybe they might have been freinds...But it's all so sorted and messy that it's ruined now, and the masquerade is over!Then you hear Hurt's voice narrating a very long bitter and a bit condescendingletter that he writes and faxes to Priestley as he heads back to England,and perhaps, to commit suicide.Priestley reads the letter privately in his condo with his girlfriendoccupied outside in the background, and shakes his head in pity....You can almost hear him saying ""Poor tragic guy!""He then recalls what a sham this whole ""friendship"" thing was andrips the long fax/letter up angrily, save a parabole of the fake scriptthat Hurt's character writes for him where Priestley's character quotesa great poet's words at a funeral sequence in the midst of one of thoseridiculous movies that he plays in!Priestley's character apparently uses this in an attempt to showhis depth as an actor...we don't get to see how it was recieved by his fans.But that's how it ends.....with a meeting/parting handshake.I felt really bad for Hurt's character...but that's how these thingsusually end when you put all of your hopes, dreams, energies and passioninto someone who can never truly be yours because that's just not who they are!The true LTR is ultimately the one you have within yourself...One-sided lust/love for someone is always a painful thing!But I thought they could've at least let Hurt's character catch a glimpseof Priestley in the buff...swimming & running nude on the L.I. beachfrontwith his dog, oblivious to just how beautiful, delicious, & hella-hothis tight defined masculine body is to behold! (With Hurt's character lingeringjust out of sight, drinking him in!)  (-:That would've at least been some consolation to the fact thatHurt's empty fantasies just couldn't be a reality!Well, needless to say, I found this film to be quite intriguing and well done.Kudos to John Hurt and Jason Priestley for their great performances.",4,Another  Bittersweet Tale Of Desperate & Unreciprocated Gay Lust Over A Young Handsome Str8 Man!!,1269820800,"03 29,

Unfortunately, it is not ultimately very satisfying, though it starts out promisingly  enough. Giles De'Ath (John Hurt), a reclusive and arrid reclusive  academician, is locked out of his London home. He ducks into a cineplex,  finding himself in the wrong theater watching 'Hot Pants College II'. About  to leave, he spots Ronnie Bostock (Jason Priestley) on screen. Having been  beaten up by some jocks, Ronnie is lying on a table in a picture of  homoerotic martyrdom. The actor's beauty captivates him and his life takes  on new purpose. Giles fantasizes about him and even takes to smoking  cigarettes that sport the same name as the Long Island town in which Ronnie  lives. Giles goes there 'to research his new book' and to find the object  of his fantasy. The two finally meet and, as their hands clasp,  fantasy becomes reality. For a moment. But reality cannot measure up and it  is downhill for the viewer, the characters, and the film. As the actor, Jason Priestley is  appropriately beautiful and seductive from a distance, but comes across as  shallow and loses his appeal as we get closer. The film is billed as a  comedy, but it isn't funny. It could have been a touching tragedy, but it  falls short. Taking after 'Death in Venice' in premise only, the film is as  different from that literary masterpiece as Venice is from Long Island.",3,Just your usual 'man meets boy who lives with girl' story,951004800,"02 20, 2000",2000,1480,"['One', 'really', 'like', 'unusual', 'little', 'film', 'premise', 'intriguing', 'full', 'possibilities', 'deftly', 'cast', 'Unfortunately', 'not', 'ultimately', 'very', 'satisfying', 'out', 'promisingly', 'enough', 'Giles', ""De'Ath"", 'John', 'Hurt', 'reclusive', 'arrid', 'reclusive', 'academician', 'locked', 'London', 'home', 'cineplex', 'finding', 'wrong', 'theater', 'watching', ""'Hot"", 'Pants', 'College', 'II', 'leave', 'Ronnie', 'Bostock', 'Jason', 'Priestley', 'screen', 'Having', 'been', 'beaten', 'up', 'jocks', 'Ronnie', 'lying', 'table', 'picture', 'homoerotic', 'martyrdom', 'actor', 'beauty', 'life', 'new', 'purpose', 'Giles', 'even', 'smoking', 'cigarettes', 'sport', 'same', 'name', 'Long', 'Island', 'town', 'Ronnie', 'Giles', 'there', ""'to"", 'research', 'new', 'book', 'find', 'object', 'fantasy', 'two', 'finally', 'meet', 'hands', 'clasp', 'fantasy', 'becomes', 'reality', 'moment', 'reality', 'can', 'not', 'measure', 'up', 'downhill', 'viewer', 'characters', 'film', 'actor', 'Jason', 'Priestley', 'appropriately', 'beautiful', 'seductive', 'distance', 'across', 'shallow', 'appeal', 'get', 'closer', 'film', 'billed', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'funny', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'touching', 'tragedy', 'short', 'Taking', ""'Death"", 'Venice', 'premise', 'only', 'film', 'different', 'literary', 'masterpiece', 'Venice', 'Long', 'Island']",N/A

I think I would have enjoyed it a bit more with either a longer ending or a different ending. The whole movie is very interesting but the ending falls flat. What I liked about it was the fascination John Hurt has for Jason Priestly...  John Hurt does a fantastic job acting in this film and he really carries the entire movie on is back. Jason Priestly isn't bad but anybody could have played his role just as good.

Penola,"[9, 11]","John Hurt is simply breathtaking in what is probably the role of his life; Jason Priestly is so surprisingly multi-layered that he nearly deceives you into thinking he has no mind/heart.  The deft and melancholy screenplay  deals with mature and compelling subject matter in an involving,  entertaining way, and though I would have preferred a more realistic ending  -- perhaps a bit more tragic for sad Giles - this movie is simply  wonderful.  You ache for the detached loneliness and insulated character  Hurt portrays with genius, and you find his crush both heartbreaking and  pitiable.  There are glimmers of humor throughout, and the softly sad music  swells appropriately; this movie does it all, and does so quietly, with  good script and good acting, period.  If you liked Gods and Monsters, you  will love this movie.

As in Mann's original story, the fixation is Platonic rather than sexual, but the film pulses with pathos, a dark Wagnerian atmosphere perfectly captured by the haunting, sublime music score by Richard Grassby-Lewis, but also the drollest wit in recent moviemaking.

62323,ABKAPN87T5G80,0783229593,Twain,"[2, 2]","This movie probably deserves more like 4.5 stars. I really like it a lot. It is the story of an old English man played by John Hurt - described best by amazon as an ""author of laborious text"" - who develops a huge (homosexual) crush on Jason Priestly's character, ""Johnny Bostock"" an aspiring actor. Stuck in b-movie roles, Bostock's participation in cheesy 80's-style teeny bopper movies introduces a side-theme to the movie that I for one found totally hilarious. Many of Bostock's cinematic appearances are shown in the film, and to see Jason Priestly playing an actor who is himself in turn playing some absolutely ridiculous 80s studmuffin is really one of the highlights of the movie.Aside from that, this movie has some moments of real wit and humor. John Hurt navigating the dives of Long Island proves to be every bit as amusing as its potential. [...]In fact, I can't think of a single movie that is anything like it in either plan or execution.That said, I admit that Love and Death on Long Island is not a flawless movie. Many people will find the ending somewhat unsatisfying, and I don't disagree. Indeed this is not a movie with a big conclusion or a ""message"" or a grand finale. But it is a movie with many modest rewards for the viewer who is prepared to accept its peculiar pace and style.",4,"Entertaining, overlooked, fresh",1105142400,"01 8, 2005",2005,1307,"['movie', 'probably', 'more', '4.5', 'stars', 'really', 'lot', 'story', 'old', 'English', 'man', 'played', 'John', 'Hurt', 'described', 'best', 'amazon', 'author', 'laborious', 'text', 'who', 'huge', 'homosexual', 'crush', 'Jason', 'Priestly', 'character', 'Johnny', 'Bostock', 'aspiring', 'actor', 'Stuck', 'b-movie', 'roles', 'Bostock', 'participation', 'cheesy', ""80's-style"", 'teeny', 'movies', 'side-theme', 'movie', 'one', 'found', 'totally', 'hilarious', 'Many', 'Bostock', 'cinematic', 'appearances', 'are', 'shown', 'film', 'see', 'Jason', 'Priestly', 'playing', 'actor', 'who', 'turn', 'playing', 'absolutely', 'ridiculous', '80s', 'studmuffin', 'really', 'one', 'highlights', 'movie.Aside', 'movie', 'moments', 'real', 'wit', 'humor', 'John', 'Hurt', 'navigating', 'dives', 'Long', 'Island', 'be', 'bit', 'as', 'amusing', 'potential', '[', ']', 'fact', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'single', 'movie', 'anything', 'plan', 'said', 'admit', 'Love', 'Death', 'Long', 'Island', 'not', 'flawless', 'movie', 'Many', 'people', 'will', 'find', 'ending', 'somewhat', 'unsatisfying', 'do', ""n't"", 'disagree', 'Indeed', 'not', 'movie', 'big', 'conclusion', 'message', 'grand', 'finale', 'movie', 'many', 'modest', 'rewards', 'viewer', 'who', 'prepared', 'accept', 'peculiar', 'pace', 'style']",N/A
62324,A18M68DE1Y6W51,0783229593,Wendy Kaplan,"[7, 7]","John Hurt shines in this obscure 1998 film that should have received more attention than it did.Hurt plays Giles De'Ath, a dry-as-dust man of letters whose intellectual tomes are as hi-brow as they are apparently boring. Completely out of touch with the modern world, and scorned by the British media (which calls him an ""erstwhile fogey, now cult""), he inadvertently stumbles into a movie entitled ""Hot Pants College II,"" a ""Porky's"" sendoff so inappropriate for Giles that it defies imagination.Realizing his mistake and about to leave in high dudgeon, Giles suddenly is riveted by the film's star, teen heartthrob Ronnie Bostock, played brilliantly by Jason Priestley. As he views what he considers a beautiful lad, Giles falls as desperately in love as any teeny-bopper ever could, to the point where he actually has to buy a television and a VCR, just so he can view the wretchedly untalented Bostock ouvre (with titles such as ""Tex Mex"" and ""Skidmarks"").Giles' obsession leads him on a desperate trip to Long Island, where his idol lives. Actually maneuvering to meet him, Giles cannot contain his great love--and the inevitable tragedy ensues.This is a sensitive and highly unusual film. The acting by Hurt and Priestley is understated, completely perfect (especially Priestley as the completely untalented Bostock, who aspires to Shakespearean heights)and truly inspired.For those who like something off the beaten path, this is definitely a movie to watch for its sheer brilliance.",4,"Sensitive, Unusual, Brilliant Acting",1104105600,"12 27, 2004",2004,1490,"['John', 'Hurt', 'obscure', '1998', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'received', 'more', 'attention', 'plays', 'Giles', ""De'Ath"", 'dry-as-dust', 'man', 'letters', 'intellectual', 'tomes', 'are', 'as', 'hi-brow', 'are', 'apparently', 'boring', 'Completely', 'touch', 'modern', 'world', 'scorned', 'British', 'media', 'erstwhile', 'fogey', 'now', 'cult', 'inadvertently', 'movie', 'entitled', 'Hot', 'Pants', 'College', 'II', 'Porky', 'sendoff', 'so', 'inappropriate', 'Giles', 'imagination.Realizing', 'mistake', 'leave', 'high', 'dudgeon', 'Giles', 'suddenly', 'riveted', 'film', 'star', 'teen', 'heartthrob', 'Ronnie', 'Bostock', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Jason', 'Priestley', 'what', 'beautiful', 'lad', 'Giles', 'desperately', 'love', 'teeny-bopper', 'ever', 'could', 'point', 'where', 'actually', 'buy', 'television', 'VCR', 'just', 'can', 'view', 'wretchedly', 'untalented', 'Bostock', 'ouvre', 'titles', 'such', 'Tex', 'Mex', 'Skidmarks', 'obsession', 'desperate', 'trip', 'Long', 'Island', 'where', 'idol', 'lives', 'Actually', 'maneuvering', 'meet', 'Giles', 'can', 'not', 'contain', 'great', 'love', 'inevitable', 'tragedy', 'ensues.This', 'sensitive', 'highly', 'unusual', 'film', 'acting', 'Hurt', 'Priestley', 'understated', 'completely', 'perfect', 'especially', 'Priestley', 'completely', 'untalented', 'Bostock', 'who', 'Shakespearean', 'heights', 'truly', 'inspired.For', 'who', 'something', 'beaten', 'path', 'definitely', 'movie', 'watch', 'sheer', 'brilliance']",N/A
