205376,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,6300184293,Alex Udvary,"[4, 9]","It's hard for me to say who's films I enjoy more Preston Sturges or Ernst Lubitsch, both to me are masters of the sophisticated comedies. It's like asking someone who do you like more Chaplin or Keaton, both are so good you'd hate to chose one or the other. But of all the Sturges films I've seen I have to admit ""Christmas in July"" I think is his weakest. If judge purely on it's own merits it's a fine lighthearted enjoyable comedy. But when you consider the other films Preston Sturges made, ""Christmas in July"" doesn't hold up as well. It doesn't seem to have the bite movies such as ""The Great McGinty"" (Sturges' first film as dirctor), or ""The Palm Beach Story"" and my favorite ""Unfaithfully Yours"" had. It seems as if Sturges missed a few marks with this one. I didn't laugh as much as I usually do when watching one of his films. Though there is one great scene dealing with Powell after he thinks he won a contest and goes to the office of Dr. Maxford (Raymond Walburn). That scene made me laugh. And I promise not to give it away.""Christmas in July"" has Jimmy MacDonald (Dick Powell, this was at the time Powell wanted to break away from the musicals) as a poor but in love young man trying to make it big. Currently he has tried out in a contest created by Dr.Maxford (Walburn) who is looking for a new slogan for his coffee. Jimmy has entered in many contest before and naturally has lost them all. But, the way he figures it, one of these days he's bound to win one. So he and his sweetheart, Betty (Ellen Drew) hope for the best. If Jimmy wins they can finally get married. But everything will not work out so fine.While at work some co-workers over-hear the news of Jimmy entering the contest and they decide to have a little fun at his expense. They tell him he's won the contest and a prize of $25,000!Sturges' comedy starts to take off at this point, but I just can't help but feel the movie leaves much to be desired. And I only say this because I've truly enjoyed Sturges' past films. But this one is just not quite up to par with the rest of them. If you've never seen a Preston Sturges comedy, please do not start here.So is there anything good to say about this movie? Yes. As I said before it is a cute old-fashioned comedy that has one of those happy endings we've come to expect from Hollywood. It does have a few funny scenes and is a harmless silly comedy. I would only suggest that fans of Sturges watch this one.Bottom-line: One of Preston Sturges weaker comedies. Not to say this is a bad movie. Has a few bright spots but doesn't live up to Struges' other films such as ""Unfaithfully Yours"", ""The Palm Beach Story"" & ""The Lady Eve"".",3,Just Picture A Pent-House Way Up In The Sky!,1070150400,"11 30, 2003",2003,2664,"['hard', 'say', 'who', 'films', 'enjoy', 'more', 'Preston', 'Sturges', 'Ernst', 'Lubitsch', 'are', 'masters', 'sophisticated', 'comedies', 'asking', 'someone', 'who', 'do', 'more', 'Chaplin', 'Keaton', 'are', 'so', 'good', ""'d"", 'hate', 'chose', 'one', 'other', 'Sturges', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'have', 'admit', 'Christmas', 'July', 'think', 'weakest', 'judge', 'purely', 'own', 'merits', 'fine', 'lighthearted', 'enjoyable', 'comedy', 'when', 'consider', 'other', 'films', 'Preston', 'Sturges', 'made', 'Christmas', 'July', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'as', 'well', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'bite', 'movies', 'such', 'Great', 'McGinty', 'Sturges', 'first', 'film', 'dirctor', 'Palm', 'Beach', 'Story', 'favorite', 'Unfaithfully', 'Yours', 'had', 'Sturges', 'missed', 'few', 'marks', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'as', 'much', 'usually', 'do', 'when', 'watching', 'one', 'films', 'one', 'great', 'scene', 'dealing', 'Powell', 'won', 'contest', 'office', 'Dr.', 'Maxford', 'Raymond', 'Walburn', 'scene', 'made', 'laugh', 'promise', 'not', 'give', 'away', 'Christmas', 'July', 'Jimmy', 'MacDonald', 'Dick', 'Powell', 'was', 'time', 'Powell', 'wanted', 'break', 'away', 'musicals', 'poor', 'love', 'young', 'man', 'trying', 'make', 'big', 'Currently', 'tried', 'out', 'contest', 'created', 'Dr.Maxford', 'Walburn', 'who', 'looking', 'new', 'slogan', 'coffee', 'Jimmy', 'entered', 'many', 'contest', 'naturally', 'lost', 'way', 'one', 'days', 'bound', 'win', 'one', 'sweetheart', 'Betty', 'Ellen', 'Drew', 'hope', 'best', 'Jimmy', 'can', 'finally', 'get', 'married', 'everything', 'will', 'not', 'work', 'out', 'so', 'fine.While', 'work', 'co-workers', 'over-hear', 'news', 'Jimmy', 'entering', 'contest', 'decide', 'have', 'little', 'fun', 'expense', 'tell', 'won', 'contest', 'prize', '25,000', 'Sturges', 'comedy', 'take', 'off', 'point', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'movie', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'only', 'say', ""'ve"", 'truly', 'enjoyed', 'Sturges', 'past', 'films', 'one', 'just', 'not', 'quite', 'par', 'rest', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Preston', 'Sturges', 'comedy', 'please', 'do', 'not', 'start', 'here.So', 'there', 'anything', 'good', 'say', 'movie', 'Yes', 'said', 'cute', 'old-fashioned', 'comedy', 'one', 'happy', 'endings', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'Hollywood', 'have', 'few', 'funny', 'scenes', 'harmless', 'silly', 'comedy', 'would', 'only', 'suggest', 'fans', 'Sturges', 'watch', 'one.Bottom-line', 'One', 'Preston', 'Sturges', 'weaker', 'comedies', 'Not', 'say', 'bad', 'movie', 'few', 'bright', 'spots', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'Struges', 'other', 'films', 'such', 'Unfaithfully', 'Yours', 'Palm', 'Beach', 'Story', 'Lady', 'Eve']",Christmas in July VHS

But to me, this movie is not about the nominal shopping spree. Nor is it about the indictment of societal greed. It's not even about seeing that vaunted Sturges supporting cast continue to evolve and grow.It's about the quieter scenes, such as: A simple, salient, sublime rooftop conversation between Powell and his love Drew, with evening stars and city lights sparkling behind them, as he speaks of his desires to be someone&#65533; really BE someone&#65533; someday; His delight, when he thinks he has &quot;made it&quot;; the climax, when he realizes that all his success has been a sham; and the very end, which reassures even us cynics that there will be a happy outcome for him some time down a road we do not get to travel together in this film.The fact that there are laughs interspersed should not detract from the subtle yet powerful statements this movie makes. Besides, the comedy doesn't always work; some is dated, and some just isn't all that comical. The serious moments work better, and make us appreciate the lightheartedness more.CIJ is innocent and heartfelt and tells the Everyman's small story of big dreams.

It's quite representative of the Sturges style: nicely-plotted, quick-moving, logically progressive, containing spare dialogue with few real laughs and especially a most predictable ending-- one that's telegraphed to the viewer early on.SYNOPSIS--Jimmy MacDonald (Powell) and his girlfriend Betty Casey (Ellen Drew) both add figures for a business conglomerate. Jimmy dreams of winning advertising slogan contests. He's currently entered in a Maxford Coffee radio promotion that has a $25,000 grand prize. Jimmy's punny entry, IF YOU CAN'T SLEEP, IT ISN'T THE COFFEE-- IT'S THE BUNK meets only arguments from unamused folks who insist that coffee DOES keep you awake.Three cruel co-workers slip a phony telegram onto Jimmy's desk telling him he's won the big money. Jimmy goes to Maxford headquarters and owner Dr. Maxford (Walburn) issues a check for $25,000. Maxford doesn't realize the  judges panel is deadlocked, with no winner yet determined. One lone holdout (Demarest) refuses to go along with the others' winning slogan.At this point, the rest of the plot is easily figured out.Money-drunk Jimmy takes Betty on a spending spree. Just by flashing the Maxford company check to the store owner, he's allowed to buy her a diamond ring and fur coat. Then Jimmy gets his mom an electric davenport/daybed with all sorts of built-ins (like a disappearing radio and lamp), and buys gifts for everyone on his street. Four taxis transport the happy couple and their haul home. The joyous neighborhood giveaway is like (altogether now) ""Christmas in July.""As this is occurring, Dr. Maxford learns that NO telegram was sent, as NO winner was ever selected. He angrily sets out to get his check back. Next is the anticipated confusion and at the end, that single contest judge wins out: HIS slogan choice is revealed.

205379,A2CW9IQAPFEYLM,6300184293,Bomojaz,"[3, 4]","One of Preston Sturges's earliest movies for which he both wrote and directed, and it's a beauty. William Powell is the victim of a practical joke pulled by his fellow employees and believes he's won $25,000 in a jingle contest. He spends the money on presents for all the people and kids in his poor tenement neighborhood and then learns of the hoax. His self-confidence suffers more than anything. The comedy is like quicksilver, and the jokes and wisecracks fly fast and furious. The funniest scene might be the one on the street where the store he bought everything from tries to get its stuff back - it's hilarious.Sturges usually had a hidden (and sometimes not so hidden) message burried within the humor, and here it's all about what it means to be a success and whether money can bring happiness. Usually he's pretty subtle about these messages, but unfortunately here he beats us over the head with it by ending the picture with a two-minute speech about ""giving the unknown little guy a chance"": no one wants a lecture after laughing your head off for an hour.

It's also one of Dick Powell's best roles, as a earnest but unrealistic working-class guy who keeps entering radio contests hoping to win a big prize. The film is packed with great character actors, many who appear in other Sturges films, and all of whom give rock-solid performances.  Perhaps what's most compelling here is Sturges' presentation of the earthy life in New York City's vibrant, crowded ethnic neighborhoods, centered on the tenement row that Powell's character, Jimmy McDonald, lives in, a street packed with friendly though colorful Slavic, Jewish, Italian and Irish families who all share a wisecracking, New Yorker bonhomie. It's a great (if exaggerated) picture of a bygone era, the golden years of New York's great immigrant rush, where the native-born children of European immigrants are busting at the seams, ready to move up the ladder and grab a piece of the pie in a bustling, post-Depression America. Of course, it's all laced with Sturges' progressive political messaging, which may seem preachy (it is, but that's part of the fun) but hardly misplaced. Great stuff, particularly for viewers who are eager for a window into a very real and not-too-distant past. Highly recommended.

There are no villains in this film -- plot complications arise from innocent misunderstandings or pranks, never from deliverate cruelty.  Sturges indulges in none of Capra's class warfare -- here, the rich are just as warmly human as the poor.  A film teeming with great character actors.  Read James Harvey's book &quot;Romantic Comedy in Hollywood from Lubitsch to Sturges&quot; -- his high praise for &quot;Christmas in July&quot;  makes for inspired reading -- he mentions scenes in this film where the screen is jampacked with Hollywood's best character actors -- at least, they were at their best when directed by Preston Sturges.  Another book  (a book of movie &quot;bests&quot; ) suggests that this film has the best happy ending of any film  because only the audience realizes that it is a happy ending -- the characters in the film do not yet know that the gods have smiled down on them and that a great reversal of fortune is about to befall them -- a black cat runs in front of Dick Powell and Ellen Drew -- they ask a black janitor if this portends good luck or bad luck -- he tells them that  all depends on what happens next -- and what  will  happen next  is sweetly wonderful, but only we, the audience, know it.

In 1940 Preston Sturges, who writes and directs the thing, presents his uproarious comedy, CHRISTMAS IN JULY, as a cinematic for instance. In it, office drone and big dreamer Jimmy MacDonald (Dick Powell) anxiously tunes in to the Maxford House Coffee-sponsored radio program. He awaits the announcement of the winner to a slogan contest, of which first prize is $25,000.Even though the contest jury is mulling over 2,947,582 submissions, Jimmy thinks he's got it won on the strength of his entry: ""If you don't sleep at night, it isn't the coffee, it's the bunk."" Jimmy thinks his slogan rather brilliant. His fiancee, Betty Casey (Ellen Drew), is confounded by how very cryptic it is. She argues, ""But coffee keeps you awake."" Either way, she longs to be married already except that Jimmy is reluctant, seeing as how he doesn't make enough to support them (and their mothers).At this point, veteran supporting actor William Demarest steps on-camera as the one lone holdout in the jury. The other judges are leaning one way, Demarest not so much, and so the jury gets deadlocked. On this 449th broadcast of the Maxford House Coffee program, the emcee regretfully declares over the airwaves that no winner has been picked as of yet.The plot really kicks off the next morning when a fretful Jimmy is subjected to an office prank that gets out of hand and which leads him to think that he'd just won the slogan contest. The mix-up persists when the owner of Maxford House Coffee mistakenly hands him a check. So now cue Jimmy and Betty's whirlwind shopping spree as they not only buy presents for their moms but for the entire neighborhood as well. That, my friend, is largesse. Ah, but what happens when them folks at Maxford House Coffee learn that Jimmy didn't win the contest after all?Preston Sturges' knack for sublime comic mayhem, his ability to ground the story and to inject pathos in the midst of levity, and his wicked satiric approach towards American consumerism make this (only his second feature film directed) an unexpected little gem. And with a running time of 67 minutes, the pace is dynamite. Powell exhibits a darker side here, something we'd see more of when he gets his wish a few years later and finally starts landing those more dramatic noirish roles. But as a precursor, here's a nighttime rooftop scene in which he sinks into despair over his inability to rise above poverty row. Powell and Ellen Drew make for an amiable pair, and it's fun watching them splurge and unwittingly stir up the hornet's nest. Demarest, the little that we see him, is in full-on grouch mode and he ends up getting the last laugh. But also credit Harry Hayden. He plays Mr. Waterbury, the savvy supervisor who early in the film imparts some really solid advice to Jimmy. Would that all bosses be that understanding. CHRISTMAS IN JULY may be Sturges' warm-up for his later, more classic comedies, but the exquisite craftsmanship is already present, and his compassion for them regular folk. And, by the way, Jimmy's slogan? I don't get it either.",4,"""If you don't sleep at night, it isn't the coffee, it's the bunk.""",1375833600,"08 7, 2013",2013,3164,"['when', 'come', 'money', 'sage', 'corner', 'proclaims', 'sort', 'person', 'truly', 'are', 'surfaces', '1940', 'Preston', 'Sturges', 'who', 'thing', 'uproarious', 'comedy', 'CHRISTMAS', 'IN', 'JULY', 'cinematic', 'instance', 'office', 'drone', 'big', 'dreamer', 'Jimmy', 'MacDonald', 'Dick', 'Powell', 'anxiously', 'tunes', 'Maxford', 'House', 'Coffee-sponsored', 'radio', 'program', 'announcement', 'winner', 'slogan', 'contest', 'first', 'prize', '25,000.Even', 'contest', 'jury', 'mulling', '2,947,582', 'submissions', 'Jimmy', 'got', 'won', 'strength', 'entry', 'do', ""n't"", 'sleep', 'night', ""n't"", 'coffee', 'bunk', 'Jimmy', 'slogan', 'rather', 'brilliant', 'fiancee', 'Betty', 'Casey', 'Ellen', 'Drew', 'confounded', 'how', 'very', 'cryptic', 'coffee', 'keeps', 'awake', 'way', 'be', 'married', 'already', 'Jimmy', 'reluctant', 'seeing', 'how', ""n't"", 'make', 'enough', 'support', 'mothers', '.At', 'point', 'veteran', 'supporting', 'actor', 'William', 'Demarest', 'on-camera', 'one', 'lone', 'holdout', 'jury', 'other', 'judges', 'are', 'leaning', 'one', 'way', 'Demarest', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'so', 'jury', 'deadlocked', '449th', 'broadcast', 'Maxford', 'House', 'Coffee', 'program', 'emcee', 'regretfully', 'airwaves', 'winner', 'been', 'picked', 'yet.The', 'plot', 'really', 'next', 'morning', 'when', 'fretful', 'Jimmy', 'subjected', 'office', 'prank', 'hand', 'think', ""'d"", 'just', 'won', 'slogan', 'contest', 'mix-up', 'persists', 'when', 'owner', 'Maxford', 'House', 'Coffee', 'mistakenly', 'check', 'So', 'now', 'cue', 'Jimmy', 'Betty', 'whirlwind', 'shopping', 'spree', 'not', 'only', 'buy', 'presents', 'moms', 'entire', 'neighborhood', 'as', 'well', 'friend', 'largesse', 'Ah', 'what', 'when', 'folks', 'Maxford', 'House', 'Coffee', 'learn', 'Jimmy', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', 'contest', 'Preston', 'Sturges', 'knack', 'sublime', 'comic', 'mayhem', 'ability', 'ground', 'story', 'inject', 'pathos', 'midst', 'levity', 'wicked', 'satiric', 'approach', 'towards', 'American', 'consumerism', 'make', 'only', 'second', 'feature', 'film', 'directed', 'unexpected', 'little', 'gem', 'running', 'time', '67', 'minutes', 'pace', 'dynamite', 'Powell', 'darker', 'side', 'here', 'something', ""'d"", 'see', 'more', 'when', 'wish', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'finally', 'landing', 'more', 'dramatic', 'noirish', 'roles', 'precursor', 'here', 'nighttime', 'rooftop', 'scene', 'despair', 'inability', 'rise', 'poverty', 'row', 'Powell', 'Ellen', 'Drew', 'make', 'amiable', 'pair', 'fun', 'watching', 'splurge', 'unwittingly', 'stir', 'up', 'hornet', 'nest', 'Demarest', 'little', 'see', 'full-on', 'grouch', 'mode', 'up', 'getting', 'last', 'laugh', 'also', 'credit', 'Harry', 'Hayden', 'Mr.', 'Waterbury', 'savvy', 'supervisor', 'who', 'early', 'film', 'really', 'solid', 'advice', 'Jimmy', 'Would', 'bosses', 'be', 'understanding', 'CHRISTMAS', 'IN', 'JULY', 'may', 'be', 'Sturges', 'warm-up', 'later', 'more', 'classic', 'comedies', 'exquisite', 'craftsmanship', 'already', 'present', 'compassion', 'regular', 'folk', 'way', 'Jimmy', 'slogan', 'do', ""n't"", 'get']",Christmas in July VHS

The comic foil characters have more humanity than similar characters in better known, and more highly regarded, Sturges films. And it's a terrific spoof of the PR industry.At the Soho Repertory Theatre, my coartistic director Marlene Swartz and I came across Sturges's original playscript for the story, entitled A Cup of Coffee, when we were producing a series called ""The Lost American Play"" in the late 1980s.Surprised that the play had never been produced on the stage, we obtained permission from Preston's son Tom and his widow Sandy for Soho Rep to premiere it at the Greenwich House Theatre in 1988, where it played to capacity houses and came close to being optioned for Broadway.Our production provoked media interest in Preston Sturges's career and resulted in a book deal for Sandy Sturges, who published Preston's writings as his posthumous autobiography. Sandy and Eddie Bracken subsequently presided over a book signing at a Sturges festival at the Film Forum in New York.As a result of this rewarding experience, I continue to be attached to Christmas in July for reasons beyond the film's merits, but I still trust my original reactions to it, and for me it shares with The Lady Eve the status of favorite among so many Preston Sturges masterpieces.",5,Comedy and Humanity,1119571200,"06 24, 2005",2005,1359,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'loved', 'film', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'described', 'detail', 'wo', ""n't"", 'repeat', 'comic', 'foil', 'characters', 'have', 'more', 'humanity', 'similar', 'characters', 'better', 'known', 'more', 'highly', 'regarded', 'Sturges', 'films', 'terrific', 'spoof', 'PR', 'Soho', 'Repertory', 'Theatre', 'coartistic', 'director', 'Marlene', 'Swartz', 'came', 'Sturges', 'original', 'playscript', 'story', 'entitled', 'Cup', 'Coffee', 'when', 'were', 'producing', 'series', 'called', 'Lost', 'American', 'Play', 'late', '1980s.Surprised', 'play', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'produced', 'stage', 'obtained', 'permission', 'Preston', 'son', 'Tom', 'widow', 'Sandy', 'Soho', 'Rep', 'premiere', 'Greenwich', 'House', 'Theatre', '1988', 'where', 'played', 'capacity', 'houses', 'came', 'close', 'being', 'optioned', 'Broadway.Our', 'production', 'provoked', 'media', 'interest', 'Preston', 'Sturges', 'career', 'resulted', 'book', 'deal', 'Sandy', 'Sturges', 'who', 'published', 'Preston', 'writings', 'posthumous', 'autobiography', 'Sandy', 'Eddie', 'Bracken', 'subsequently', 'presided', 'book', 'signing', 'Sturges', 'festival', 'Film', 'Forum', 'New', 'York.As', 'result', 'rewarding', 'experience', 'continue', 'be', 'attached', 'Christmas', 'July', 'reasons', 'film', 'merits', 'still', 'trust', 'original', 'reactions', 'shares', 'Lady', 'Eve', 'status', 'favorite', 'so', 'many', 'Preston', 'Sturges', 'masterpieces']",Christmas in July VHS
205386,A240QB45BSMDAN,6300184293,Josh P.,"[2, 2]","""Christmas in July"" is among the finest and yet unappreciated comedies of Hollywood's golden age. Dick Powell, a newcomer at Paramount studios, portrays Jimmy MacDonald who has entered a coffee company's slogan contest with the grand prize being $25,000. Some of his co-workers play a joke on him with a fake telegram. Jimmy and his fiance, Betty Casey (Ellen Drew) become excited as Jimmy is thought by his boss as being such a genius at writing slogans that Jimmy gets his own office and Betty is his private secretary. After they pick up the check (surprising to Dr. Maxford of Maxford House Coffee who doesn't know of anybody selected), they go on a shopping spree buying something for everybody in their neighborhood. Probably the only reason for the film's title is because Ellen Drew gives the line ""It's like Christmas, in July."" When Dr. Maxford finds out nobody was selected and the check was supposedly fake, Shindel Bros., the department store of which they went on a spree, starts to take everything back until the pompous Dr. Maxford steps in. Shindel is convinced when the townspeople take Jimmy's side and not Dr. Maxford's. Later, as they view Jimmy's new office, his boss is still impressed with his slogan-writing ability until when he hears Jimmy didn't really win and it was a joke. His boss goes into a fury, but Betty takes Jimmy's side by saying that he belongs in his own office becuase he thinks he has ideas and gives a short speech to him. In Maxford House, Dr. Maxford gets into a huge fit when he is distressed at the contest and that his workers have finally selected a winner. Guess who? Quite likely, the cycle will start again.

The leads are good, Sturges' pen and camera are both sharp as usual, and there are a few nice little speeches that could easily come from It's A Wonderful Life or other classics.What's most appealing here is the respect and love for the ""common man"", and the rather bold little rants against selfishness and mindless capitalism. The boss' speech at the end about believing in greatness only because others believed it first hits the nail on the head quite uncomfortably, and shows that the more things change...While no masterpiece, Christmas In July is well worth watching as a pleasantly amusing film with real heart.And at only 67 minutes, it's a nice little amusement that doesn't force you to sit through many slow moments at all.Wouldn't mind seeing some new movies this short; double bills again, anyone?Btw, we got this from nitflex, and it was part of a multi-disc Sturges retrospective also listed here.

205392,A6FIAB28IS79,6300184293,Samuel Chell,"[2, 2]","Preston Sturges' comedic cinematic style raises comparisons with the comparable post-Depression era screwball comedies of Howard Hawks and Frank Capra.  Hawks holds down his camera movement in favor of giving free rein to his stars--Cary Grant, Kathryn Hepburn, Rosalind Russell--who reward us with the dazzling, breakneck speed of the patter that their director has entrusted them with.  By contrast, Capra employs his virtuoso camera work to highlight the heroic dignity earned by his all-Amercan common man, played by social mavericks like the laconic Gary Cooper and the intense, manic-obsessive Jimmy Stewart.Each has his respective strengths as a filmmaker, their representations of democracy and the American dream unique to his particular background and experiences.  We applaud Hawks' radical non-conformists, while living out our own aversion to habit and convention through them.  Capra's everyman-heroes, on the other hand, affirm our need to always believe that only in America is it possible to realize the ""Dream"" or, failing that, to be recipients, much like George Bailey, of a higher calling.But it's Sturges who represents the workaday world as we're most likely to recognize it--as a limited physical space in which we struggle to survive by following the rules, performing punctually and dependably, and doing what's expected of us.  In such an environment, opportunities are modest and rare, but with imagination, persistence and luck, the ordinary member of the social community can ""have his or her day.""  it may not be the ""American Dream"" as it was imagined by Charles Foster Kane, Jay Gatsby, or Willie Loman, but upon closer examination ""Christmas in July"" delivers a far more genuine pay-off than anything dreamt of by the aforementioned deluded dreamers. It's the realization of a love that is transformative, unconditional and all-seasonal.  And it comes not to a megalomaniac or a star-dazed quasi-deity but to an organization man who refuses to relinquish faith in his ability to affect those he associates with through his own inventive use of language and in the American public's ability to understand him.",5,Living the dream,1356566400,"12 27, 2012",2012,2142,"['Preston', 'Sturges', 'comedic', 'cinematic', 'style', 'comparisons', 'comparable', 'post-Depression', 'era', 'screwball', 'comedies', 'Howard', 'Hawks', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'Hawks', 'down', 'camera', 'movement', 'favor', 'giving', 'free', 'rein', 'stars', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Kathryn', 'Hepburn', 'Rosalind', 'Russell', 'who', 'reward', 'dazzling', 'breakneck', 'speed', 'patter', 'director', 'entrusted', 'contrast', 'Capra', 'virtuoso', 'camera', 'work', 'highlight', 'heroic', 'dignity', 'earned', 'all-Amercan', 'common', 'man', 'played', 'social', 'mavericks', 'laconic', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'intense', 'manic-obsessive', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart.Each', 'respective', 'strengths', 'filmmaker', 'representations', 'democracy', 'American', 'dream', 'unique', 'particular', 'background', 'experiences', 'applaud', 'Hawks', 'radical', 'non-conformists', 'living', 'out', 'own', 'aversion', 'habit', 'convention', 'Capra', 'everyman-heroes', 'other', 'hand', 'need', 'always', 'believe', 'only', 'America', 'possible', 'realize', 'Dream', 'failing', 'be', 'recipients', 'much', 'George', 'Bailey', 'higher', 'calling.But', 'Sturges', 'who', 'workaday', 'world', ""'re"", 'most', 'likely', 'recognize', 'limited', 'physical', 'space', 'struggle', 'survive', 'following', 'rules', 'performing', 'punctually', 'dependably', 'doing', 'what', 'expected', 'such', 'environment', 'opportunities', 'are', 'modest', 'rare', 'imagination', 'persistence', 'luck', 'ordinary', 'member', 'social', 'community', 'can', 'have', 'day', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'American', 'Dream', 'was', 'imagined', 'Charles', 'Foster', 'Kane', 'Jay', 'Gatsby', 'Willie', 'Loman', 'closer', 'examination', 'Christmas', 'July', 'far', 'more', 'genuine', 'pay-off', 'anything', 'dreamt', 'aforementioned', 'deluded', 'dreamers', 'realization', 'love', 'transformative', 'unconditional', 'all-seasonal', 'not', 'megalomaniac', 'star-dazed', 'quasi-deity', 'organization', 'man', 'who', 'relinquish', 'faith', 'ability', 'affect', 'own', 'inventive', 'use', 'language', 'American', 'public', 'ability', 'understand']",Christmas in July VHS
