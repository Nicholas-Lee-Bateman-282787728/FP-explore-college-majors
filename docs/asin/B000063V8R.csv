696192,A15IKI9BAE75T2,B000063V8R,Alex G,"[2, 4]","There are several compelling reasons to purchase this set:This is by far the best of several great NG seasons; writing is crisp, the dialog is visceral, the tempo is great, and the shows are generally as good or better than you will find in earlier or later years.The characters' development is proceeding on all fronts, human, Klingon, and crew-wise. The production, writing, and directing is nearing its peak.But, as important as any of these are, don't forget ILM (div of LucasFilms) did the special effects. This is as high a quality of special effect as you will ever see in television. It is guaranteed with all the computer and CGI junk as there is now, you will not see better sci-fi action than this. MANY OF YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN THE ORIGINAL Next Gen SHOWS IN HI DEF. YOU MUST!! It is leaps and bounds better than other versions.Many of us trekkers are just now getting the high quality 1080i or 1080p high def televisions. You will not believe how much better the quality of Next Gen is until you see it on one of these hi def sets. Get one with HDMI and upcoding, and it will up-convert your standard def show like Next Gen DVD TO HDMI and 1080i or p. It is unbelievable!! As good as the VHS tapes were, as good as you can record Trek off TV nowdays, the factory stuff with the Dolby Surround encoding cannot be beat. Many movies do not have the quality of these Trek shows. Some of these shows had as much as 3 Million in special effects budgets- for 1987 that was a ton of money. Some blockbuster films did not have much more budget than a single trek show!So, add this new compelling element, top quality video, to the OTHER strengths of Season Three Next Gen and you have an all time winner. No collectors set of videos would be complete without Year 3, the Third Season, of Star Trek Next Gen. It is excellence personified. The stereo is near perfect, audio mixing is the best I ever heard (check out the subwoofer content in engineering scenes), surround is first class, the directing, writing, acting, and direction, cannot be beat for TV, and the special effects are as good as you will ever see. You can bet there will never be another Trek Next Gen. But if you have a high def television, you are in for a treat, as this is historic. The Pinnacle of television.This is the complete package for Sci Fi and Trek fans. You get the action, the effects, the cerebral, philosophical nature of Trek, and video that cannot be beat, 19 hours of it, for 62$. Mighty hard to beat. Gene, the Great Bird of the Galaxy, would be proud. Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to some really classic trek and sci fi and at least get season three. If you are a trek fan, this one season is the least you can try out. Science Fiction simply does not get any better than this.Star Trek The Next Generation - The Complete Third Season",5,Next Gen Really Hits Its Stride See it in HD,1202601600,"02 10, 2008",2008,2835,"['are', 'several', 'compelling', 'reasons', 'purchase', 'set', 'far', 'best', 'several', 'great', 'NG', 'seasons', 'writing', 'crisp', 'dialog', 'visceral', 'tempo', 'great', 'shows', 'are', 'generally', 'as', 'good', 'better', 'will', 'find', 'earlier', 'later', 'years.The', 'characters', 'development', 'proceeding', 'fronts', 'human', 'Klingon', 'crew-wise', 'production', 'writing', 'directing', 'nearing', 'peak.But', 'as', 'important', 'are', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'ILM', 'div', 'LucasFilms', 'did', 'special', 'effects', 'as', 'high', 'quality', 'special', 'effect', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'television', 'guaranteed', 'computer', 'CGI', 'junk', 'now', 'will', 'not', 'see', 'better', 'sci-fi', 'action', 'MANY', 'YOU', 'HAVE', 'NEVER', 'SEEN', 'THE', 'ORIGINAL', 'Next', 'Gen', 'SHOWS', 'IN', 'HI', 'DEF', 'MUST', 'leaps', 'better', 'other', 'versions.Many', 'trekkers', 'are', 'just', 'now', 'getting', 'high', 'quality', '1080i', '1080p', 'high', 'def', 'televisions', 'will', 'not', 'believe', 'how', 'much', 'better', 'quality', 'Next', 'Gen', 'see', 'one', 'hi', 'def', 'sets', 'Get', 'one', 'HDMI', 'upcoding', 'will', 'up-convert', 'standard', 'def', 'show', 'Next', 'Gen', 'DVD', 'TO', 'HDMI', '1080i', 'p.', 'unbelievable', 'As', 'good', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'were', 'as', 'good', 'can', 'record', 'Trek', 'off', 'TV', 'nowdays', 'factory', 'stuff', 'Dolby', 'Surround', 'encoding', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'beat', 'Many', 'movies', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'quality', 'Trek', 'shows', 'shows', 'had', 'as', 'much', '3', 'Million', 'special', 'effects', 'budgets-', '1987', 'was', 'ton', 'money', 'blockbuster', 'films', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'much', 'more', 'budget', 'single', 'trek', 'show', 'So', 'add', 'new', 'compelling', 'element', 'top', 'quality', 'video', 'OTHER', 'strengths', 'Season', 'Three', 'Next', 'Gen', 'have', 'time', 'winner', 'collectors', 'set', 'videos', 'would', 'be', 'complete', 'Year', '3', 'Third', 'Season', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Gen', 'excellence', 'personified', 'stereo', 'perfect', 'audio', 'mixing', 'best', 'ever', 'heard', 'check', 'out', 'subwoofer', 'content', 'engineering', 'scenes', 'surround', 'first', 'class', 'directing', 'writing', 'acting', 'direction', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'beat', 'TV', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'as', 'good', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'can', 'bet', 'there', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Gen', 'have', 'high', 'def', 'television', 'are', 'treat', 'historic', 'Pinnacle', 'television.This', 'complete', 'package', 'Sci', 'Fi', 'Trek', 'fans', 'get', 'action', 'effects', 'cerebral', 'philosophical', 'nature', 'Trek', 'video', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'beat', '19', 'hours', '62', 'Mighty', 'hard', 'beat', 'Gene', 'Great', 'Bird', 'Galaxy', 'would', 'be', 'proud', 'Do', 'favor', 'treat', 'really', 'classic', 'trek', 'sci', 'fi', 'least', 'get', 'season', 'three', 'are', 'trek', 'fan', 'one', 'season', 'least', 'can', 'try', 'out', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'simply', 'not', 'get', 'better', 'this.Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', 'Complete', 'Third', 'Season']",Star Trek The Next Generation - The Complete Third Season

It introduced the BORG, a villain that would remain a part of Star Trek all the way through Voyager and even into Enterprise.  At the end of the second season you saw only 22 episodes due to a strike by the writing staff.  Everyone was wondering how the third season would shape up and if the show would rebound.  Boy did it rebound!  The third season began with a brand new writing staff including Ronald D. Moore and Michael Pillar and began the series on its final five SUPERB seasons.  In the third season we saw the return of Denise Crosby and Tasha Yar and we got a deeper and more personal look at the BORG.  Season three also marks the return of Gates McFadden and Dr. Beverly Crusher (GREAT MOVE!).

696202,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B000063V8R,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[8, 8]","When Star Trek: The Next Generation entered its third season, it was in trouble. The critical reception to the show's second year had been mixed, producer and effective showrunner (under Rick Berman) Maurice Hurley had left and the cast were unhappy with the removal of Gates McFadden as Dr. Beverly Crusher. As the third season opened, Rick Berman had to hire a largely new writing team, a new showrunner and had to bring back McFadden to appease the rest of the cast (particularly Patrick Stewart). Fortunately for his show and for the fans, Berman was lucky. The new showrunner was the talented Michael Piller and amongst the new writers were the young and energetic Ira Steven Behr, Rene Echeverria and Ronald D. Moore, all of whom would go on to define Star Trek for many years to come.Because of these changes, Season 3 was produced in a state of chaos. Scripts were being completed mere days before filming, leaving little time for pre-production. This can be seen in the reduced amount of location filming this season, with almost no time to book location shoots ahead of filming. However, there's a noticeable improvement in special effects thanks to the introduction of new, smaller and easier-to-shoot filming models of both the Enterprise and the Romulan warbird (which makes several appearances). New, considerably more comfortable uniforms are also introduced, to the evident comfort and relief of the actors.But what really makes the season work is the superior writing. Piller was keen to introduce more scenes of character interaction and development to the show. The guest cast are moved away from being the centre of the show, with their impact on the regular characters being more important. There's more continuity, with a recurring Romulan threat throughout the season (The Enemy, The Defector, Tin Man) and Worf's Klingon background being developed more thoroughly (Sins of the Father). Having been proven to be a sentient being in Season 2's excellent The Measure of a Man, Data's evolution continues through several episodes before peaking in The Offspring, where he tries to build a new android 'daughter'. Comedy is allowed freer reign, particularly in Deja Q, Captain's Holiday and Menage a Troi, which all feature a few good laughs (Deja Q may be the funniest episode the show ever did).But the third season's strong reputation relies on its two absolute stand-out, inarguably, stone-cold classics. Yesterday's Enterprise is a time travel story involving parallel universes which remains fully comprehensible, features one of the best space battles the show ever did and finds an intelligent and non-cheesy way of bringing back Tasha Yar. The writing is strong, with lots of moments of subtlety (the alternate Riker and Picard don't get on) and some impressive production values and details, such as the revamping of the Enterprise bridge.At the end of the season we also get The Best of Both Worlds, the show's first season cliffhanger and still the best one Star Trek's ever done. The return of the Borg, the outstanding music, the character interplay between Riker and newcomer Shelby, the effects and the doom-laden, hopeless atmosphere combine to make for one of the franchise's finest hours.Conversely, there are only a few weak moments in the mix. The Price, The Vengeance Factor and The Most Toys are quite dull, whilst The High Ground is a commentary on the Northern Ireland Troubles which misfires completely due to the writers' poor understanding of that conflict. Who Watches the Watchers? sabotages a good premise and some excellent Enterprise scenes with some dull guest cast performances. But it's more surprising how good the show has become compared to the first two seasons, with even minor episodes like The Survivors and The Hunted coming to life and being enjoyable in a way the smaller stand-alones of the first two years struggled with.On a technical basis, the HD upscaling of the show is again amazing, with the same team that handled Season 1 doing the job. That means some more beautiful 3D planet renders, some outstanding effects recreations and superior reproductions of the show's colours (Season 3 is more colourful than the first two seasons). After the slightly disappointing Season 2 upgrade (the company responsible for that is not being re-used, interestingly), the S3 update is even more astonishing. For a season that was driven so much by writing changes, the extra features do a great job of focusing on the writing team and how they went about creating the best show possible and avoiding the mistakes of the first two years.Ultimately, the third season of Star Trek: The Next Generation (*****) is outstanding. The writers, actors and crew are all on the top of their game, dragging the so-so show of the first two seasons up in quality to become something truly impressive. The season is available now in the UK and USA.",5,An excellent update to one of TNG's finest hours,1368230400,"05 11, 2013",2013,4893,"['When', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', 'entered',

696207,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B000063V8R,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[2, 3]","Nominated for 58 Emmys, including one for Outstanding Drama Series, Star Trek: The Next Generation fulfilled all the potential and promise anticipated of a long-awaited successor to the original 1960s series - Star Trek. Created by a former L.A. police officer, Gene Roddenberry, the Star Trek TV series morphed into a franchise famous for the unprecedented fanatical devotion of its audience. Lasting only three seasons during its original network run, Star Trek struck gold with its syndicated reruns, launching a number of motion pictures featuring the original cast as well as novels, comic books, collectibles, and reams of Star Trek-related memorabilia. Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987) became the first TV series to follow on the heels of the original, and its success would spark the creation of three additional series - Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (1993), Star Trek: Voyager (1995), and Star Trek: Enterprise (2001). But The Next Generation remained the most popular spin-off. Despite new characters and new episodes, the mission remained the same as before - ""to boldly go where no man has gone before..."" And to continue the rich tradition of the Star Trek name - a mission Star Trek: The Next Generation accomplishes with relative ease...Star Trek: The Next Generation takes place in the 24th Century, almost one-hundred years after Captain Kirk's crew set out to explore strange new worlds. Capt. Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart - I Claudius) commands the USS Enterprise-D and its diverse crew of humans, cyborgs, and varying life forms. Accompanying him on his voyage is an entirely new cast of passengers and crew including Commander William T. Riker (Jonathan Frakes - North & South), Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner), Lt. Commander Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton), Lt. Tasha Yar (Denise Crosby), Lt. Worf (Michael Dorn), Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden), and her son Ensign Wesley Crusher (Wil Wheaton)... Together, they struggle against numerous obstacles to carry out the mission of the USS Enterprise: ""To explore strange new worlds... To seek out new life; new civilizations... To boldly go where no one has gone before!"" This pioneering attitude, coupled with imaginative and brilliantly-produced alien worlds, provides Star Trek with its unique allure and special place within American pop culture - especially those episodes from the original series, widely regarded as the most popular of the Star Trek franchise...The Star Trek: The Next Generation (Season 3) DVD features a number of exciting episodes including the season premiere ""Evolution"" in which the crew of the Enterprise is tasked with escorting a top scientist to an area where a star is set to explode. But their voyage is hindered by a computer malfunction plaguing the entire star system... Other notable episodes from Season 3 include ""The Enemy"" in which Geordi finds himself stranded on a dangerous planet with an irate and injured Romulan while the Enterprise's rescue attempts are thwarted by a Romulan ship, and ""Sins of the Father"" in which Worf and his brother must work together to keep their father, who has been accused of treason, from being convicted of feeding vital information to the Romulans...Below is a list of episodes included on the Star Trek: The Next Generation (Season 3) DVD:Episode 49 (Evolution)Episode 50 (The Ensigns of Command)Episode 51 (The Survivors)Episode 52 (Who Watches the Watchers)Episode 53 (The Bonding)Episode 54 (Booby Trap)Episode 55 (The Enemy)Episode 56 (The Price)Episode 57 (The Vengeance Factor)Episode 58 (The

696212,A18ZM0DL1MWZQ0,B000063V8R,Carl Malmstrom,"[12, 13]","By it's third season, ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" was, undoubtedly, a great series.  Some of the series' finest episodes were made during this season and it is considered to be arguably the finest season of television the people of Star Trek have ever done.  That said, it's still a bit of a shame to see them not pull out all the stops for the DVD release - the format that's made for bells and whistles.Aside from the twenty-six episodes of the series - for which there is little reason to go into detail here given the large number of other reviews that discuss the episodes in detail - the seventh disc of the set features four extra segments - a season overview, a look at the changes in the crew in Season Three, and two ""Departmental Briefings"": this time around focusing on episode production as well as the usual ""Memorable Missions"" segment.  They're all great segments and they do a great job of bringing the behind-the-scenes community to life.  These segments especially illuminate what Michael Piller - who would go on to be one of the most influential backstagers on ""Next Generation"", ""Deep Space Nine"" and ""Voyager"" - brought to the show when he signed on board that season.  Much of the interview footage was shot new for the episode and it highlights and gives anecdotes for many of the episodes.All that said, though, the set - as with the previous two - seems to be missing something.  There are no episode commentaries, no scripts, no storyboards, no deleted scenes, and no TV ads.  While much of what would be covered in some episodes' commentaries is in the extras segments, it would still have been very nice to see a play-by-play analysis of ""Yesterday's Enterprise"" or ""The Best of Both Worlds, Part I"" - or even ""Who Watches the Watchers"" by Executive Producer Rick Berman and the aforementioned Michael Piller - or by Michael Okuda or Jonathan Frakes or any of the other Trek actors and creators that make the show so great.  Likewise, there must be an absolute ton of material in the vaults - segments cut for time, episode promos, screen tests, etc. - that are still waiting to see the light of day.  To really wow us with a box set, it would have been nice to have more of that in here.Nonetheless, this is still a wonderful DVD set and certainly worth owning - even by the casual Star Trek fan.

After the shortened and varied second season, The Next Generation finally gets going in the third season. Not only is the writing brilliant but the production values have had a shot in the arm. The revised title sequence is much stronger and the title music is re-mixed. The entire ship looks and sounds better too, with the new uniforms with the collars (much better).A new director of photography was brought whose lighting technique allowed them to get rid of that ""this is obviously filmed in a studio"" look when creating planet side sequences. This season also has some of the best scores to accompany the series before it became a constant rehash of the same orchestral sequences later on in the programme. Ron Jones does a particularly excellent job, especially with ""The Best of Both Worlds"" and newcomer Jay Chattaway's score to ""Tin Man"" turned a mediocre episode into something more emotional.This season shines with great episodes such as The Enemy (Romulans!), The Defector (real spy thriller stuff), The Hunted, The High Ground (terrorist episode). There are however 2 stunners: ""Yesterday's Enterprise"" and ""The Best of Both Worlds."" Alternative timelines and the Borg have always made some of the best episodes - Yesterday's Enterprise gives Tasha Yar a chance to return for an episode where the Federation is still at war with the Klingons. The Best of Both Worlds is the high point of the entire series - great story, great effects, great music, and that feeling of ""they can't do that"" when the ""To be continued...."" line appeared on the screen.

696234,A2O0UEY1P0C87W,B000063V8R,E. Rodriguez,"[0, 0]","The basic premise is that some humanoid is found under wreckage on some generic planet, and Dr. Crusher and her awesome medical team save his life. Interestingly enough, this alien is a total nice person, but has no memory. Details emerge from the crew's investigation that include evidence of a battle, and that he was running away from something. Further, clues are dropped that his entire being is slowly undergoing a change (a painful one at that). Aside from his incredibly fast recovery abilities, this alien also has the ability to heal others! But it isn't only physical healing, he also is able to heal things such as a lack of self-confidence, as in the case of Geordi. (As this was going on, I could not help but feel the writers took an inspiration from a certain famous character from the Bible's New Testament.)Well, the story goes on, and the crew takes a liking to this fellow, but Picard of course, has to protect his crew and ship. This is apparent when the alien's pursuers show up and threaten battle with the Enterprise if they do not hand over John Doe (as the crew has come to know him). Sure enough, at the last possible moment, John, the alien, remembers what he was about all along--he was undergoing a metamorphosis that his species undergo, but their government had been oppressing for generations. John undergoes his metamorphosis, and turns into a creature of light (again, a Bible reference?), and he totally shows his enormous power and prevents any further conflict between the two species. Picard, and the crew, are amazed at this metamorphosis, and John goes on his way.

And of course, the concepts of healing, and allowing change are explored. Good pacing, good acting, and wonderful moments with worth and Geordi.

The first two seasons were full of growing pains, while the seventh was somewhat underwhelming due to producers and writers shifting their focus elsewhere.Season 3 is generally remembered for three fan favorite episodes - ""Deja Q"", ""Yesterday's Enterprise"" and part 1 of ""The Best of Both Worlds.""  But I think what is remarkable is that there are almost no bad episodes - the only read duds are ""The Price"" and ""Menage a Troi"".  Instead, you get a mix that's split about 50-50 between episodes that you'd characterize as very good or better, and episodes that are solid, watchable but unremarkable.  That's different from season 5, where the quality dispersion is much wider.Besides the fan favorites, there are two remarkable episodes I would like to single out as personal favorites - the classic military thriller ""The Defector"" and the wonderful ""The Offspring"".

696245,A1ZPPOOG5DCKT7,B000063V8R,Ian Martin,"[2, 3]","Here it is! The breakthrough season of The Next Generation. With the addition of collars, all of the officer's now look like they're in adult outfits. Crusher's back with an incredibly absurd hair cut (didn't she learn from the one thing Wesley does right?) The shows music heads in a completely new direction - from synthesized dreck to more ambient and tonal accents.Most importantly the writing moves from space viruses and aliens of the week to more personal character driven stories. This season contains some of the best episodes in all seven, including The Best of Both Worlds and Yesterday's Enterprise. In fact this may be the best season of all seven - even more hilarious as, due to the writers strike that caused a shorten second season and birthed a clip show, the writers had virtually no episodes written.Does that mean it's totally devoid of suck? Well...perhaps on the level on the first two seasons, yes. Still, there are a few episodes interspersed in Season 3 that really don't add much by way of character development or mythology, or are just plain awful.My purpose in writing is to speed someone right to the meat and potatoes of the series. I've marked the bad episodes that lack any details about the overall series mythology ""skip"" - the one-offs that aren't necessarily great but might be worth coming back to ""skippable"" - episodes that are good or contain required information about the series mythology, ""watch"" - and the episodes that would be great in any season ""must watch.""Evolution - Skippable - That darned Wesley falls asleep at his desk while experimenting with microscopic robots called nanites. Instead of eating him they escape and start eating the ships computer. Crusher returns for some nice exchanges between her and Picard. The writing is solid (except for the term ""food slot"" - hadn't we already coined the term ""replicator"" by now?) Still, this episode is unusual in that it is mostly about the guest star rather than any of the crew, in this case Doctor Paul Stubbs, the astrophysicist whose one chance at greatness is being ruined by the nanites. There are better episodes beyond.The Ensigns of Command - Watch - The crew is contacted by a reclusive race that is colonizing a planet now inhabited by descendants of a lost group of human explorers. Because of radiation on the planet the only person who can beam down is Data. A few common series cliches crop up here including female characters who find Data's childlike obliviousness sexy, as well as stubborn inhabitants of a planet that don't seem to realize: THEY'RE IN THE FUTURE. Everyone can vaporize you from space. Still, this is a pretty good episode in which Data's character grows a layer or two.The Survivors - Skippable - A mystery episode. The crew answers a distress call from a federation colony to find the surface of the planet completely obliterated except for a house on a tiny patch of land. Inside is an elderly couple that refuses to leave despite the barren planet. Meanwhile Troi starts being driven mad by music...and so will you. If not by the music then by Deanna's relentless screaming and crying. It's not a terrible episode by any means except for the taxing requirements placed on Deanna's acting ability. There is a wonderfully chilling moment at the end of the episode when we discover what it is the couple has been hiding, but once you know the secret the episode isn't worth much beyond the final five minutes.Who Watches The Watchers - Watch - A group of scientist are studying a race of bronze age proto-vulcan's when the holographic generator that keeps them hidden from the natives malfunctions. Leland Palmer, one of the proto-vulcans, is injured and in a stupor, sees the Captain and crew saving him. When he comes-to again on the planet he starts a new religion worshipping his god, ""The Picard."" This is a fascinating episode in which the show reveals itself to be almost overtly atheist, or at least anti-religious. In an effort to reverse the damage done by their exposure Picard spends an afternoon giving one of the proto-vulcans a tour of the ship culminating in a wonderful scene where he demonstrates to her how any technology sufficiently advanced enough is indistinguishable from magic.The Bonding - SKIP - If you thought that what the show needed was a fresh infusion of child acting than here is your episode! A redshirt member of an away team dies on a mission. While getting counseled through the loss by Deanna, the away member's son starts to get visits from his deceased Mom. It's not a TERRIBLE episode by any means and there are some nice scenes where Worf, a fellow orphan, tries to reach out to the child. Gabriel Damon, the son, doesn't do an awful job but doesn't really have the acting chops to carry this heavy material. In general, the episode suffers from the same problem most of the other episodes have that focus on a guest star character: it's just not all that interesting.Booby Trap - Watch - This a is mythology episode referenced later. The Enterprise is cataloging the ruins of a planet that was the final battle of two species over a thousand years. The crew happens upon one of their battleships in pristine condition, at the same time fall into the same energy sapping booby trap the crew of the ancient vessel did. To help him figure out a way to escape Geordi recreates one of the Enterprise Warp Drive designers on the holodeck, Dr. Leah Brahams, and becomes attached to her. It's a nice character building episode for Geordi and lingers a lot building chemistry between the crew members. It's a joy to watch Picard's glee over getting to live out a boyhood fantasy he had while building ships in bottles. The ""relationships on the holodeck"" theme had been touched on earlier in 11001001 where Riker met Minuet - but unlike where Riker lingered bizarrely over his digital date here the results are much more believable when Geordi realizes his infatuation and decides to step away.The Enemy - Watch -  Geordi finds himself marooned on a planet, the captive of an injured Romulan named Bochra. The planet plays hell with their different physiologies, blinding Geordi and paralyzing Bochra. As the episode progresses, Geordi, who has the means to save them both, eventually earns Bochra's trust and willingness to see through mutual hatred. For the most part, antagonists in Star Trek episodes are lacking in complexity. Their evilness tends to lack motivation as they're in the story simply to provide conflict. This episode contains both. The scenes between are convincing exchanges between two people whose dislike is based on systematic cultural propaganda and not each other. However, on the bridge the more prototypical Star Trek conflict is occurring between Picard and the one-armed-Romulan, Admiral Tomalok. Tomolak is the stock xenophobic Star Trek adversary, lying at all times, unreasonable, and reckless - a contrast to Patrick Stewart's measured and even-handed Picard. The nicest bit in the entire episode though occurs with Worf's refusal to donate some mojo in his cells that could save a second Romulan dying in sick bay. Despite numerous pleas from different crew members the writers don't sell Worf out and have him see the error of his ways. Instead Worf refuses and we learn something about his character. The Enemy is a nice episode breaking a bunch of new and interesting ground with only a few of the nagging problems of the first two seasons.The Price - Skip - The Enterprise hosts a group of alien's negotiating for the rights to a stable wormhole. One of the negotiators, Devinoni Rall, who has an uncanny knack what he does, begins negotiating his way into Troi's pants. After Troi lets herself be seduced in several creepy scenes of spectacularly bad chemistry, she finds out that Rall is actually half Betazed too. This presents her the ""complicated"" choice of having to protect the creepy unethical negotiator she's now sleeping with or do her job. Simply a bad episode, not a terrible one. Wesley is barely around, Lwaxanna never appears, and Troi never has to cry. Still, it's a shame that often times the writer's only ideas for what to do with a Troi-centric episode in these early seasons is to have her be romanced...badly. The prelude to this cringe-worthy romance between Devin and Troi consists of him coming to her office and within 30 seconds running his hand on her arm and messing up her hair. When I tried that at my last job I ended up unemployed and writing episode guides for 17 year old television shows. WTF Star Trek? You lied to me! (side note: technically this is a mythology episode. There's a scene where two Ferengi get marooned in the Delta Quadrant. They return later in an episode of Voyager. I'm still giving this one a pass though.)The Vengeance Factor - Skippable - The crew is negotiating a peace between a species with butts on their heads and marauders they cast out a hundred years before. The marauders, who look like members of The Kiss Army, are starting to show up dead and one of the servants of the negotiators is the cause. Just kind of a dull episode with a nice premise buried beneath a convoluted setup: The servant in question, Yuta, is a 100 year old genetically altered assassin whose entire life has been about killing. That might have been an interesting premise with implications about personal identity and self-determination. Instead it takes twenty minutes of exposition about this species before we even realize that Yuta matters to the plot at all. There's a nice scene toward the end when Riker confronts her but it isn't worth sitting through the entire thing.The Defector - Skippable - The Enterprise receives a distress call from inside the Romulan neutral zone and comes to the aid of defecting Romulan, Admiral Ja'Rok. Ja'Rok says he has information about a Romulan base in the neutral zone intended to be the spearhead to an invasion. The crew must try to figure out if he's telling the truth. This is another episode focused on someone other than a primary cast member however in this case, thanks to a quality performance by James Sloyan, this one is actually pretty good. In a Romulan-centric season Sloyan brings some diversity to the Federation enemy by playing Ja'Rok as a patriotic countryman who sacrifices everything for what he believes to be the greater good. In his jousts with Picard we see two men who want to trust each other but are too worn by years of cultural hatred. It's all enjoyable and the episode teases some epic-ness-ness but ultimately doesn't go very far, ending up a small blip in the series. A good one to circle back to if you find yourself addicted. One thing that starts to irk me at this point in the series: Why in all the universe is the One-Armed-Romulan the only one the Enterprise always seems to run into?The Hunted - Skippable - While considering a planet's application for entrance into the Federation, the Enterprise becomes involved in the recovery of one of their escaped prisoners. Troi senses he may be more than he seems. Her discovery leads to the Enterprise being embroiled in a conflict between a society and it's cast offs from war. Kind of. James Cromwell (Zerphram Cocrane) plays the Prime Minister of the planet seeking Federation entrance and, while it's nice to see him there isn't a lot for him to do with this part. For the most part the writing in this one is a little misdirected. The action in the story is centered around the prisoner, Roga Danar, running rampant through the ship. The problem is that since the story has painted him as such a martyr we never really feel any sense of danger because we know the writers wouldn't have him kill anyone (though it might have been a little more interesting if he had.) There are some nice Machurian Candidate and brainwashing ideas here that are toyed with briefly when Data and Danar have a conversation about their mutual programming and being more than the sum of their parts. Mostly the episode is about action and the ending is an anti-climax.The High Ground - Skippable -While delivering medical supplies, Beverly gets abducted by terrorists whose enigmatic leader wants her to find a cure for a transport system they use that's killing them. I really WANT to give this one a watch. It's fantastic new ground for the series. Beverly and Finn, the leader of the terrorists, have conversations about the nature of terrorism, the difference between a terrorist and a revolutionary is just the difference between winning and losing. In fact the episode seems strangely pro-terrorist, especially when Data tells Picard that according to his research, terrorism seems an effective way of promoting social change. There's also a nice bit at the end between Picard and Beverly when Beverly thinks they might die and touches on their relationship that's always just below the surface. The problem is the scenes that aren't between Picard, Beverly, and Finn are flat and cliched. In order to provide Finn's intellectual terrorist an adequate counterbalance, there are a number of scenes between Riker and the head of police, Alexana. Alexana is an impassioned officer...a little TOO impassioned - her melodramatic ramblings border on Tasha Yarr's Season 1 suck. And after such interesting discussions on the moral ambiguity of terrorism the writers try and wrap a happy bow around the episode by having a child terrorist lay his weapon down at the end and Riker and Alexana share a platitude. Icky.Deja Q - Must Watch - Q is made human as punishment from the continuum. Picard grants him temporary sanctuary on the ship and assigns Data to follow him for the duration of his stay. This is one of the top ten episodes of the series, easily the best pure ""Q"" episode (considering Q-Who was really about the Borg.) Q's brief struggle with being human is funny and incredibly well written. The scenes between John De Lancie and Brent Spiner are addictively watchable and the episodes finale is clever and pitch perfect.A Matter of Perspective - Skippable - Continuing Season 3's overall trend of, ""Yeah...that was Ok,"" is A Matter of Perspective. The episode actually begins with a great teaser. The crew is researching the progress of a Doctor Apgar who is looking into harnessing Kreiger waves on a Federation space station. We see the bridge of the ship with the space station on the viewer. Riker's voice comes over communicator saying he's ready to leave. As he does, the space station explodes. After the opening credits, Riker is accused of the Doctor's murder by the local police, whose governmental politics are (GASP) guilty until proven innocent. Picard convinces him to hold an investigation on the holodeck where Riker's visit to the destroyed space station is recreated, as seen by various members of the ship and station personnel. It's an interesting idea but the Riker created in the police recreations is such a mustachio'd twirling lunatic that it kind of ruins any of the suspense in the episode. Part of the promise of the opening tease was that we didn't get to see exactly what happened on the space station, which means that we don't KNOW if Riker is guilty or, short of that, culpable for something. It's an opportunity to at least see the ordinarily blandly stalwart first officer in another light. However about the point that the sheriff's holo-decked version of Riker yells, ""YOU'RE A DEAD MAN APGAR!!"" we know the episode isn't going to be revealing any interesting nuances to Riker's personality. It would have been much more interesting had the recreations built a plausible setup based on what we already know of Riker's character. Doesn't matter anyway because Wesley solves the problem for everyone. Swing and a miss.Yesterday's Enterprise - Must Watch - When most Trek fanatic's I know list their top five, Yesterday's Enterprise is in there someplace. While not one of my personal favorites, it is one of the best hard sci-fi episodes in the series and an incredibly important episode in the show's mythology. The Enterprise is investigating a temporal rift in space when a vessel from the past slips through, altering the present. The Federation is now at war with the Klingons, Tasha is at tactical, Data Worf is gone, and the only one who realizes anything has changed is Guinan.  She pleads with Picard to send the vessel from the past back, something that they both know would mean the deaths of everyone on board. It's a great alternate history kind of story where the ordinarily plushy universe of Trek gets a little more dystopic, including an oddly gory battle at the end. One of the reasons to watch the show.The Offspring - Watch - Data creates his own child, a daughter named L'al. If you haven't seen this one go watch it right now. When you're done come back and we'll talk about it. Seen it? All right. I like this episode but didn't we cover this in Measure of a Man? If Data is a sentient self determining being then it would follow that so is his offspring. Yet here again we have some cliched Federation honcho demanding that an artificial person be moved against their will. It's a contrivance simply to lend the story some conflict and is completely unnecessary and a little anti-climactic given...how the episode ends. The real joy in the story is in Data's relationship with his daughter and exploration of parenting. Had the story really needed a conflict to hold our interests it could have been Data's battle with L'al's ""sickness"" throughout the entire episode which eventually resulted in her death. As long as we're splitting hairs here about a decent episode: Hallie Todd's performance as L'al is incredibly grating. She spends most of the episode doing a robot voice rather than exuding the childlike essence that Brent Spiner does so well with. Regardless, it's a wonderful episode and I still get dust in my eyes at it's conclusion everytime. Must remember to not chop onions whenever I watch this one...Sins of the Father - Watch - Worf meets his younger brother and returns to the Klingon homeworld to defend the honor of their father, accused of being a traitor against the empire. This is an incredibly important episode in Worf and the Klingon's story arc. We are introduced to the Klingon government and it's inner-workings, Worf's brother, and the House of Durass. It's all very well and good if you like Klingon's but whenever I watch these episodes I end up fixated on the same thing: How the hell did the Klingon's achieve space travel? They're portrayed as such murdering back-stabbing petulant cave men. It doesn't make sense to me that a species who never appears to demonstrate any intellectual prowess what-so-ever could have even made it to the rocket age. Still, this is one you have to watch.Allegiance - Watch - Picard is kidnapped and replaced with a doppleganger. While the real Picard struggles to figure out a way to escape his prison with three other captive aliens, his double takes the Enterprise into danger. I'm going to use the excuse that this is the first episode that introduces the nausigans...that's why it gets a Watch and not a skippable. The nausigans are an intimidating looking alien that are somewhat significant in Picard's story arc later in the series. Really though I just like this episode. The real Picard ends up in a fascinating Cube-esque scenario he needs to figure his way out of, and his double plays nicely against our expectations of Picard. His scenes are fun and sometimes cringe inducing. The ending doesn't quite provide the payoff that the setup promises but it's still an enjoyable ride in getting there.Captain's Holiday - Watch - In this season's special features there is an interview with Patrick Stewart in which he says that he felt his character was becoming a bit dry. Picard's roll on the show was becoming little more than that of a negotiator - someone who stood on the bridge and talked. Apparently this was the reason for Captain's Holiday: keeping the show's anchor cast member happy.  So, Picard is burnt out and forced to take a vacation by Crusher. He heads to Risa and tries to spend some time reading and relaxing by the pool, but ends up with a woman named Vash searching for a relic left by a time traveler. Frankly, it's a pretty lame episode. There are a couple of nice bits between the crew and the Captain in the first ten minutes but otherwise the story is mostly devoid of humor or any intrigue. There are a pair of time traveler's that are trying to retrieve a relic, a ferengi that I think is supposed to be funny (he isn't), and a makeout session that doesn't make a ton of sense. In fact when Picard kisses Vash, her personality seems so in contrast to his own that it's almost as though he's just doing it to either shut her up or have a fling...which isn't really keeping with Picard's character. It's all kind of a mess but Vash reappears later in this series and another. Watch with a friend or a bottle.Tin Man - Watch - The Enterprise takes a psychic diplomat named Tam Elbrun on board who is to help the crew make first contact with a ship that might be a living being. Tam has a volatile personality sculpted by years of being overwhelmed by his powerful psychic ability he is  unable to turn off. This is an episode you see often in trailers and retrospective's concerning the series. The art design and special effects used to bring Tin Man to life were some of the most interesting in the series to that point. Some of the best music in the series also finds it's way into this one. Tin Man's journey through space isn't painted with loud fanfare or obvious strokes, but with subtle strings and woodwinds almost as though he were a whale floating in the ocean. However what makes this episode interesting to me is Tam and his ability to read thoughts that he can't turn off. In his scenes with the crew we see him responding to things the crew say to him out loud as well as what they're saying in their own heads. We get a sense of what an awful, self-esteem destroying life it must have been to be constantly assaulted by the things people think but don't say. It's a compelling and thoughtful episode.Hollow Pursuits - Must Watch - Hollow Pursuits introduces Lieutenant Barclay. Barclay is a new transfer to Geordi's engineering team, shy and reclusive. Geordi can't stand him but is instructed by Picard to draw the reclusive engineer out of his shell just as strange malfunctions begin occurring on the ship. In doing so, Geordi discovers Lieutenant Barclay has a bit of a holodeck addiction. It's a theme that the series has been screaming for since the holodeck gained the ability to simulate people. A holodeck is potentially a more addictive escapist medium than television, video games, or drugs combined. Finally we get an episode that deals with it in a somewhat realistic, if amusing fashion. It's a wonderful episode that digs a layer or two deep beneath the conventions of the universe to consider the ramifications of it's inner workings.The Most Toys - Watch - Data is captured by a collector of rare items named Kivas Fajo who makes the crew believe he was destroyed in a shuttle accident. Perhaps one of the best guest star appearances in the entire series, Saul Rubinek plays Fajo with such energy and self love that it's hard for us not to love him too, despite his status as Data's captor. The best sequences in the episode occur in conversations between Fajo and Data where he tries to make Data behave more like a piece of property than a captive. Fajo's manipulations serve as a wonderful medium for exposing the outer limits of Data's personality that we see only brief glimpses of throughout the series. Despite a mostly humorous tone throughout the episode (due to Saul's giddy performance) the ending has a chilling moment and leaves the viewer to decide what Data might be capable of, as he stares blankly into the faces of his comrades who are wondering the same thing. It's a complex and thoughtful episode.Sarek - Watch - The famous Ambassador Sarek comes on board the Enterprise to negotiate a peace treaty. When he does, strange emotional outbursts begin occurring among the crew and it seems that Sarek's questionable emotional state may be the cause of it. The episode bridges the gap between some of the original shows lore and the Next Generation and there are some fun sequences including a brawl in Ten Forward. Perhaps most famous is a sequence that could have been a throwaway in an otherwise mostly average episode. Picard, under the duress of Sarek's psychic emotional baggage, freaks the hell out and Patrick Stewart shows everyone he could read the classifieds and make it sound like Hamlet. In his rants we hear bits and snippets of events in Sarek's life to which we have no background or insight and yet we feel the anguish and regret of Sarek's lifetime in Stewart's performance.Menage a Troi - SKIP - Lwaxanna, the Ferengi, and Wesley create a trifecta of badness in this slap-sticky scholck ridden monstrosity. Lwaxanna, Troi, and Riker are kidnapped by a horny ferengi that wants Lwaxanna to read his opponents minds and play with his lobes. Wesley saves the day. It isn't season one bad but it's close. As usual in these terrible episodes, Patrick Stewart provides the lone moment of redemption as he's forced to fake a smitten rage at the ferengi to get Lwaxanna back. When he tells Wesley to set course for Betazed at Warp 9, we feel his pain and are hoping for an equally speedy end to the episode. Oh and that plucky Wesley gets a field promotion to ensign. Avoid this mire of misguided camp at all costs.Transfigurations - Skip - Beverly suffers the Florence Nightingale (Lorraine McFly?) over a patient the crew finds crashed on an alien planet. The patient suffers from amnesia and is experiencing a cellular mutation. As the crew investigates this John Doe's past he and Beverly form a bond. There isn't a lot of fun to be had in watching the Dr. Crush on this character. In fact I found her scenes between Troi and Wesley to be a bit shallow as she struggles to make a simple crush sound more profound. It doesn't help that John Doe speaks in slow deep bass like he's just fallen out of a romance novel or a self-hypnosis tape.The Best of Both Worlds Part 1 - Must Watch - One of the top ten episodes of the entire series. The Borg send a single ship toward Earth. At this point in the series the Borg had only been seen in the single episode where Q tossed the ship into their territory. Before the movie and Voyager sapped them of almost all of their fright and intimidation (the shark in Jaws is scariest when you DON'T see him) this was how bad-ass the Borg were. One single vessel could assimilate all of humanity. With this two-parter the show reaches an epic level of story telling not yet seen even in the movies.What do you think the best and the worst episodes from this season are?",4,The First Season Worth

The upgraded picture quality is fantastic and the value added material bonus features make it worth it.  Here's what I don't understand about these newly repackaged DVDs.  I appreciate the new artistic rendering on the packaging, but why are they over $50?  The Blu Rays are supposed to retail for $119 per set, but they are never that much.  They're usually around $60 on release day and rarely over $80 at any other time.  Why would anyone spend over $50 for these newly repackaged DVDs when they could get the Blu Rays jammed packed with new bonus features for not much more?If they really want to market the re-released DVDs to people who don't much care for Blu Ray, or for people who don't have a Blu Ray player, why not lower these DVD sets to something reasonable like $25-$30 per season?",1,Way Over Priced,1367020800,"04 27, 2013",2013,887,"['have', 'been', 'ordering', 'new', 'Blu', 'Rays', 'are', 'released', 'will', 'continue', 'do', 'so', 'upgraded', 'picture', 'quality', 'fantastic', 'value', 'added', 'material', 'bonus', 'features', 'make', 'Here', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'newly', 'repackaged', 'DVDs', 'appreciate', 'new', 'artistic', 'rendering', 'packaging', 'why', 'are', '50', 'Blu', 'Rays', 'are', 'supposed', 'retail', '119', 'set', 'are', 'never', 'that', 'much', ""'re"", 'usually', '60', 'release', 'day', 'rarely', '80', 'other', 'time', 'Why', 'would', 'anyone', 'spend', '50', 'newly', 'repackaged', 'DVDs', 'when', 'could', 'get', 'Blu', 'Rays', 'jammed', 'packed', 'new', 'bonus', 'features', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'really', 'want', 'market', 're-released', 'DVDs', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'much', 'care', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'player', 'why', 'not', 'lower', 'DVD', 'sets', 'something', 'reasonable', '25-', '30', 'season']",Star Trek The Next Generation - The Complete Third Season
696248,A31H9TAGAYWPE,B000063V8R,"""ja1864""","[0, 0]","As the other reviewers have pointed out this is an awesome DVD set. The other two seasons were very good but this is the one all the fans have been waiting for. I won't mention all the episodes, since other reviewers gave excellent summaries. Mine will be just my favorites and opinions.The Booby Trap (Picard saving the ship at the end is priceless and that music matches perfectly), The Defector (the suspense if the Romulan will attack or not and the surprise Picard has for them), The Hunted (nice to see someone give our heroes a run for their money and the message on war), Deja Q (Q being human and having new experiences very good), Yesterday Enterprise (man that is one of the best all time!! This is one of the best what if, time-warp episodes), Sins of the Father (the beginning of what I call the Klingon saga, this is the springboard), Hollow Pursuit (Barclay's fantasy world), and the Best of Both Worlds (every Trek fans know about that one!).The interviews that they have on the DVD are very cool especially how this was a season where they had lots of new writers and basically writing on the fly. It also features heavily Michael Piller. He gives his insight on a lot of the episodes and why the Best of Both Worlds was so good.

Without a doubt, two episodes stand out as the best Star Trek has ever produced, and they are both included in this set.  ""Yesterday's Enterprise"" is a great tragedy that even Shakespeare would have been proud of.  The return of Tasha Yar is done excellently.  The ethics and conflicts involved are classic.  ""The Best of Both Worlds Part 1"" needs no introduction.  This episode shocked the television world with the greatest cliffhanger in T.V. history and a story that left people saying ""they didn't just do that"" or ""they can't do that"".  This episode set the trend for T.V. finales that most shows who copied this format failed miserably.  Nobody does it better than Star Trek, and none has been better than this episode.  This episode alone generated more speculation, more impatience, and more debate and discussion across the nation during one summer than any Star Wars movie could.  It kept people guessing for three months, including the writers, about the outcome.  These two episodes alone are worth the price.

After the shaky first season and the short second season, in the third season we finally get to see some The Next Generation in all of its glory.Unlike most of the 1st and 2nd season episodes, the third season took the time to explore more of the backround of the characters:1) Worf's backround was thoroughly explained in ""SINS OF THE FATHER."" In that episode we meet his long lost brother and learn more about his true father.2) Another noted episode is ""THE ENEMY,"" where Geordi is stranded on a desolate planet with a Romulan. It's great to see the La Forge character actually do something besides speaking techno-babble.3) ""THE OFFSPRING"" was a great Data episode and ""SAREK"" showed that Patrick Stewart is a magnificent actor.(Keep in mind that there are also other character-driven episodes to watch that are also enjoyable.)That aside, there were many action-packed episodes:1) In ""THE HIGH GROUND,"" the Enterprise must battle terrorists after they kidnap Dr. Crusher. A great scene is when the terrorists come aboard the Enterprise and try to hijack it by force so they can destory it.2)Another action-packed episode is ""THE HUNTED,"" which is about a genetically superior veteran of planetary war that comes aboard the Enterprise. The last 10 minutes of this episode are some of the best minutes I'sve ever seen in an TNG episode.For comedy lovers, there are also some humurous episodes that let the crew lighten up for a few episodes:1) In ""DEJA Q,"" Q comes aboard the Enterprise with all of his powers lost, but no one belives him. The ""going away present"" that he gives to Data at the end is great.2) In ""MENAGE A TROI,"" Riker, Troi and her mother are captured by Ferengi. Troi's mother ends up giving ""ear foreplay"" to a Ferengi and Picard is forced to use his knowledge of poetry.And finally, to the classic of the season, ""THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS, PART 1."" Just a little better than the second part, this episode is the best overall epsiode. It has great music, stellar acting, awesome special effects, some good action, and THE BEST ENDING EVER TO A TNG EPISODE. The last 7 minutes are outstanding.Overall, the 3rd season of TNG isn't only a great one; it's the season that started TNG on its four-season greatness.

Revamped picture quality and special effects will do wonders for this show. Unless that isn't important to you, then buy it on DVD now.Season 3 is where TNG developed into the format it would more or less keep for its duration. Several major changes were made from the previous seasons. I'll cover some of them.1. The credits sequence is revamped with improved effects.2. The picture quality is substantially improved. Seasons 1 and 2 are fuzzy and truly atrocious for an 80's television series. However, TNG was rarely more than aesthetically competent.3. Micheal Pillar became head writer. With him, the writing became solid and consistent. He also introduced an open manuscript submission that allowed some brilliant new writers in such as4. Ronald D. Moore. This college drop-out went from a nobody to one of the creative masterminds of TNG and DS9 and is more responsible for Klingon culture than anyone else.5. LaForge gets promoted to Lt. Commander and Worf to Lieutenant. These are more suitable ranks for their positions.6. Around the end of the season, Wesley becomes a real ensign. This means we no longer have to look at his annoyingly ugly temporary ensign ""uniform.""7. Cloth uniforms that actually look like uniforms replace the uncomfortably tight spandex work-out clothes.8. A completely new musical direction. Seasons 1 and 2 had melodramatic 80's music. From here on out, there is a classical score composed for every episode. Personally, I'm not a huge fan of TNG era music. I think most is boring and too in the back-drop. However, there are a couple exceptions, like Tin Man.9. Crusher is back. While I did like the conflict Pulaski brought to the show, I like Gates McFadden. She is also significantly more pleasing to look at. However, Dr. Crusher remained undeveloped compared to other characters.10. The ship is revamped. The bridge chairs are more comfortable, crew quarters are enlarged and actually look like places I'd want to live in, ect.All these changes signified a substantial change in how the show was created, from the writing process to acting to production. Basically, all aspects of creating TNG received what most fans consider substantial upgrades. With that said, I am actually not a big fan of the season as a whole. I feel it started extremely weak and had weak to average episodes throughout. There are numerous exceptions, but for me, the show didn't become consistently good until Season 6.Notable episodes:Evolution: This is truly a terrible way to start a season. For one, there is almost no exposition other than a brief ""welcome back Dr. Crusher."" Because this was a Wesley episode, there seemed to be a lack of taking it seriously. The main guest character is terribly annoying. Most importantly, the underlying plot is atrocious. Wesley accidentally creates sapient/sentient nanobots. It took the Soong's three generations of collaborative genius to create Data and Lore. It took evolution billions of years to create humans. But a teenager accidentally created a novel form of intelligent life with a science experiment.The Bonding: This is just an okay episode, but it's the first episode that Ronald D. Moore wrote, and it got him his job on the writing staff.Booby Trap: This is the second of many ""something is wrong with the ship"" episodes. The first was Season 2's ""Contagion."" By this point, I was unimpressed with the engines and replicators malfunctioning. Most importantly, it makes a major fundamental error in drama. The primary conflict is that the ship is in danger of getting destroyed. Obviously, the audience knows the ship will not get destroyed. There is simply no risk of loss or threat of change.The Defector: The tenth episode marks a transition to superior writing. Prior to this, the show only had moments of true genius (like The Measure of a Man.) From here on, the percentage of excellent stories greatly increases.Deja Q: Q loses his powers and becomes human. There are no average or below Q episodes.Yesterday's Enterprise: This episode garnered the show much acclaim and for good reason. Time travel and bringing back Tasha Yar, if only briefly. I miss her.The Offspring: Data procreates. This episode is one of the saddest fictional things I've ever experienced.Sins of the Father: Moore begins his reputation as the Klingon guy. The episode is an excellent alien culture script and has outstanding art design for the Klingon home world. It is the first time Star Trek goes to Qo'noS. Perhaps the most important legacy is the start of ongoing story arcs. The episode doesn't end with everything all better; reset for next week. Worf is permanently changed. TOS and earlier TNG had some ongoing plots, but they were just one or two episode things or of minor importance. This is the start of an internal Klingon conflict that will last until Season 5. The producers and writers gradually accepted story arcs, and they would play a major role in every Star Trek show from now on.Captain's Holiday: An entertaining adventure with some plot twists. It also is an important step in the Ferengi's evolution.Hollow Pursuits: First episode with Barclay. It's fairly entertaining and a different kind of episode.Sarek: Spock's legendary father makes a crossover appearance.The Best of Both Worlds, Part 1: The Borg try to assimilate Earth. This episode greatly increased Star Trek's popularity. It has one of the best season cliffhangers ever created. It started a tradition of ending seasons with cliffhangers. When the Borg first appear, the music was so epic I had to pause the DVD to recover from the epicness. From now on, it can no longer be said, ""This paved the way for greatness.""

696262,A3GRN6J64F2C3X,B000063V8R,"Joseph P. Menta, Jr.","[4, 4]","This first fully satisfying season of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" is a must-buy.  Every episode in this third season is at least solidly entertaining (okay, I admit I have a soft spot for the one where Mrs. Troi is kidnapped by the Ferengi), with at least six or seven episodes being among the best the series has ever done.  Stand-outs include ""The Offspring"" (Data creates an android daughter); the trippy ""Yesterday's Enterprise"" (a time anomaly re-writes history, resulting in Tasha Yar being alive again); and ""The Best of Both Worlds, Part I"" (the Borg return).  A suggestion:  if you buy this set, be prepared for a season-ending cliff-hanger, mainstays of ST:TNG from season three onward.  This means you might want to have the season four box set ready to go in order to see how the Enterprise gets out of the deadly situation with the Borg seen in the final moments of season three.  About the DVD's: picture and sound are sharp and clear, and the extras are often fascinating.  I especially enjoyed the surprisingly candid interviews, where cast members discuss what they liked and didn't like about the ways their particular characters were handled by the producers.

In the Hiatus between seasons two and three, the shows producers made some very good and very important changes.  They hired Michael Piller, who from then on showed what a consistently good writer can do.  They finally got rid of the terrible spandex uniforms, which from what I've read were actually causing the actors physical problems.  They changed the main title, lead in for the show.  Overall there were a great many wonderful scenes/episodes to come out of the third season!  Some of the shows that really made the season:The Ensigns of CommandWho Watches the Watchers?

The picture and sound is incredible. They have kept everything original, recreating faithfully any effects that were not available from footage, or was missing. The model shots that ILM did back in the day of the Enterprise D during TNG's run are amazing. I feel there is a reason that TNG has been brought to Blu-Ray: it had the longest run of all the &#34;Trek&#34; TV series, and was the most popular show in syndication. To this day, this classic show is still being shown in reruns around the world. You have to see this show in Blu-Ray to experience it to the fullest. One of the best episodes of Season 3 was &#34;Sins of the Father.&#34; This was the beginning  of a series of fantastic stories revolving around Worf, and the Klingon Empire. Another favorite was &#34;Deja Q&#34;, where the infamous villain Q loses his god status, and must learn humility, and what being human is all about. And who could forget &#34;Yesterday's Enterprise&#34;, with the Enterprise C coming through a time rift. That fateful episode had severe consequences in future seasons.

Even though I already own the first two seasons in Blu-Ray, I'm still totally blown away by the quality of the picture.  It is just amazing to see such a clear image and vibrant colors and updated special efx.Things I've noticed so far that I could not have noticed from the regular DVD's : In the first few episodes Wil Wheaton has some really bad acne problems going on and every tiny little mole and pimple show up amazingly clear (okay so that's NOT so awesome, but it's there), I've noticed a smudge of eyeliner under Dr. Crusher's eye for an entire scene, a dirt stain on the Captain's sleeve, but my favorite thing to do is to pause the playback when they show computer text on the LCARS screen.  You could never read what the designers wrote until now, and let me tell you, they had a really warped sense of humor.  I was actually laughing out loud at some of the things they wrote in ""Ensigns of Command"" for the Sheliac Treaty.  I won't spoil it, you'll have to discover it yourself.And finally, along with the hi-def bloopers, we finally get to see footage of David Rappaport as the original Kivas Fajo in ""The Most Toys"".  Again, that alone is worth the price of admission, a very rare (albeit sad) treat for TNG fans.I don't have a lot of money, I'm out of work on disability and have to make every penny count.  But I can tell you I would have gladly paid more for this set of episodes, and I can't wait until the 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th seasons to come out.  I'll never get tired of watching TNG in this format, it's truly beautiful work they've done in putting all this together!EDIT: You know I just realized something that some of you might already have figured out, ALL of the 1 star reviews, with the exception of one (so far) are not even reviews for the Blu-ray set!!!If you look carefully at the sub-headings, you'll see that all those reviews are either for the DVD or for ONE episode from Amazon's Instant Video!  These reviewers were reviewing the right thing but AMAZON lumped those reviews together with the Blu-Ray reviews.  So I have no doubt that when a person reported poor quality video while trying to stream one of these episodes, if you don't look closely enough you won't even realize they are not talking about the Blu-ray set.NOTE TO AMAZON:  Could you please do a better job of organizing these reviews.

696276,A2B6VI9MQI0WKI,B000063V8R,Matthew Gladney,"[3, 4]","The third season of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" is where things really start to come together. After an often cringe-inducing first season, and an uneven second, the third go around is simply wonderful to watch. The entertainment value is high, and the show finds new ways to grow and become deeper and more complex. The production values appear to be higher, and the chemistry between the characters becomes fully realized.There is so much I love about ""TNG"" starting with this season: the set design, the photography, the acting, the stories, the entire look and feel of the show. Patrick Stewart is great as Captain Jean-Luc Picard, and Brent Spiner as Data is another favorite. The entire cast manages to form a highly engrossing ensemble.Some of my favorite stories from this season are: ""The Defector"", in which a high-ranking Romulan takes the high road and attempts to warn the Federation of impending attacks. The ending is heartbreaking. ""Sarek"", which features the venerable Mark Lenard as Spock's father, is another heartbreaking, but also profound story. ""Yesterday's Enterprise"" is simply a classic. The Enterprise C travels forward in time through a rift in space and meets Picard's Enterprise D. The plot developments, character interaction, and final outcome are some of the best underpinnings to a television episode I've ever seen. The sacrifice of both the Enterprise C and alternate-Universe Enterprise D gave me chills. And, finally, who can forget the absolutely excellent season-ender ""The Best of Both Worlds""? The story is simply pounding, the acting wonderful, and even the incidental music adds a rich, tense layer to the proceedings. An all-around solid, entertaining season.

696277,A3G074429X8F0S,B000063V8R,"M. Burks ""The Farmin' Jedi""","[1, 1]","I've purchased all the Next Generation blu-ray sets so far and have yet to be disappointed.  I'll skip the review of the actual show; we all know that season 3 is when Next Gen really hit it's stride and became the show we love, so why rehash that?  The episodes look and sound fantastic, new details that you never noticed before, and there are several episodes that feature multiple commentary tracks.  All the previous DVD extras seem to be here, and the new content is (inter)stellar.First off one of the most anticipated features for me was the inclusion of the footage featuring little person David Rappaport in the episode &#34;The Most Toys&#34;.  The actor tried to commit suicide while filming the episode and was replaced by Saul Rubineck.  I was always curious about how the episode would have been, but frankly (with all respect for the dead) Saul's performance is simply better than Rappaport's, and it is very apparent in hindsight that David is having personal issues as his performance isn't at the top of his game.  Still it's great that is was included and is  very interesting to see.This season set was pushed as &#34;the writer's set&#34; with most of the new extras dealing with the show's incredible writing staff.  We get an hour long round table discussion with the writing staff hosted by Family Guy's Seth McFarlane.  I hope we see more of these s this was truly enjoyable.  It's a very informal talk about the season and it's just a treat filled with great trivia (they almost killed Will Riker off?!?!?!).  The other extras also go in depth into the season with the actors, with plenty of trivia, anecdotes and discussion.  A long gag reel is included again, and while I LOVE the fact that each season is getting a season specific gag reel this one is fairly light on the laughs and is not one of the better ones.  But just the fact that it's included is awesome.Ok, so why only 4 stars out of 5, you ask?  Very simple.  On the same day this set was released there was also another Next Generation release.  The Season 3 cliffhanger finale and it's Season 4 conclusion were released as a re-edited &#34;movie&#34; on a separate blu ray, &#34;Star Trek: The Next Generation; The Best of Both Worlds&#34;.  This release has it's own set of extras, a gag reel from that episode, etc.  These extras go into detail on what is arguably one of the most well known episodes/cliffhangers EVER, and NONE of these features are included in the Season 3 blu-ray set, so if you want them you have to buy a totally separate blu-ray of an episode YOU NOW ALREADY HAVE to get the extra features.  This comes off as a pathetic cash-grab and I strongly hope that CBS rectifies this by including these features on the Season 4 set.  It may seem like not that big of a deal, but when I purchase the pricey box set of a season I already owned on DVD and it's not 'complete' I find that very irritating.  Oh well.That major issue aside, this is a great set overall, just remember that it is NOT complete.  ;-)",4,STAR TREK: TNG SEASON 3 IS (nearly) PERFECT!,1371254400,"06 15, 2013",2013,3016,"[""'ve"", 'purchased', 'Next', 'Generation', 'blu-ray', 'sets', 'so', 'far', 'have', 'yet', 'be', 'disappointed', ""'ll"", 'skip', 'review', 'actual', 'show', 'know', 'season', '3', 'when', 'Next', 'Gen', 'really', 'hit', 'stride', 'became', 'show', 'love', 'so', 'why', 'rehash', 'episodes', 'look', 'sound', 'fantastic', 'new', 'details', 'never', 'noticed', 'are', 'several', 'episodes', 'feature', 'multiple', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'previous', 'DVD', 'extras', 'seem', 'be', 'here', 'new', 'content', 'inter', 'stellar.First', 'off', 'one', 'most', 'anticipated', 'features', 'was', 'inclusion', 'footage', 'featuring', 'little', 'person', 'David', 'Rappaport', 'episode', '34', 'Most', 'Toys', '34', 'actor', 'tried', 'commit', 'suicide', 'filming', 'episode', 'was', 'replaced', 'Saul', 'Rubineck', 'was', 'always', 'curious', 'how', 'episode', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'frankly', 'respect', 'dead', 'Saul', 'performance', 'simply', 'better', 'Rappaport', 'very', 'apparent', 'hindsight', 'David', 'having', 'personal', 'issues', 'performance', ""n't"", 'top', 'game', 'Still', 'great', 'was', 'included', 'very', 'interesting', 'see.This', 'season', 'set', 'was', 'pushed', '34', 'writer', 'set', '34', 'most', 'new', 'extras', 'dealing', 'show', 'incredible', 'writing', 'staff', 'get', 'hour', 'long', 'round', 'table', 'discussion', 'writing', 'staff', 'hosted', 'Family', 'Guy', 'Seth', 'McFarlane', 'hope', 'see', 'more', 's', 'was', 'truly', 'enjoyable', 'very', 'informal', 'talk', 'season', 'just', 'treat', 'filled', 'great', 'trivia', 'almost', 'killed', 'Will', 'Riker', 'other', 'extras', 'also', 'go', 'depth', 'season', 'actors', 'plenty', 'trivia', 'anecdotes', 'discussion', 'long', 'gag', 'reel', 'included', 'again', 'LOVE', 'fact', 'season', 'getting', 'season', 'specific', 'gag', 'reel', 'one', 'fairly', 'light', 'laughs', 'not', 'one', 'better', 'ones', 'just', 'fact', 'included', 'awesome.Ok', 'so', 'why', 'only', '4', 'stars', '5', 'ask', 'Very', 'simple', 'same', 'day', 'set', 'was', 'released', 'was', 'also', 'Next', 'Generation', 'release', 'Season', '3', 'cliffhanger', 'finale', 'Season', '4', 'conclusion', 'were', 'released', 're-edited', '34', 'movie', '34', 'separate', 'blu', 'ray', '34', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', 'Best', 'Both', 'Worlds', '34', 'release', 'own', 'set', 'extras', 'gag', 'reel', 'episode', 'etc', 'extras', 'go', 'detail', 'what', 'arguably', 'one', 'most', 'well', 'known', 'episodes/cliffhangers', 'EVER', 'NONE', 'features', 'are', 'included', 'Season', '3', 'blu-ray', 'set', 'want', 'have', 'buy', 'totally', 'separate', 'blu-ray', 'episode', 'YOU', 'NOW', 'ALREADY', 'HAVE', 'get', 'extra', 'features', 'off', 'pathetic', 'cash-grab', 'strongly', 'hope', 'CBS', 'including', 'features', 'Season', '4', 'set', 'may', 'seem', 'not', 'big', 'deal', 'when', 'purchase', 'pricey', 'box', 'set', 'season', 'already', 'owned', 'DVD', 'not', ""'complete"", 'find', 'very', 'irritating', 'Oh', 'well.That', 'major', 'issue', 'aside', 'great', 'set', 'overall', 'just', 'remember', 'NOT', 'complete']",Star Trek The Next Generation - The Complete Third Season

I enjoy a good story and sometimes the various Star Trek series have provided them. Sometimes they are really dumb also. I am not sure if all of the viewers realize when they are watching the show as intensely as some of the other reviewers here apparently do, but these Star Trek characters are fictional. Nevertheless, good character creates good television and one episode in this volume rates as the best Star Trek episode ever of any Star Trek series. ""Yesterday's Enterprise"" is a marvelous not to be missed work of television drama. I am sure that the intense viewer will find even more enjoyment out of this episode than the casual viewer, but even a first time watcher will find it to be excellent.

696293,AD0J5KK4WQXNS,B000063V8R,OverTheMoon,"[12, 12]","The Star Trek Collection is a worthy hobby and certainly the largest of the television series DVD Collections (The Original Series, The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager and Enterprise). At around 1100 minutes per box (a few hours less than the TOS seasons) we are still looking at approx 30 boxes with 700 hours of viewing. That is 1 month of non-stop Star Trek. No DVD series comes remotely close to that. Get going collecting right now and build up on each succession over the years. By the end you will have a very serious anthology that defines the word awe. This is the kind of item that requires 1 hour a day of your time for the next few years. It is a cherished memory that served your fathers and will serve your children also. Our very planet, Earth, has advanced because of Gene Roddenberry's admirable concept. Roddenberry nailed the premise of the series when he said that he wanted to create a show with characters that we could look up too. `The Bridge' members are like our family. Watch what they do. Then go and spend your life striving for the same on Earth. What engineer, medic, scientist, teacher, worker can not say that Star Trek has not influenced them? The show is this significant in the development of our species. Even Christians respect and quote its authority and it is not hard to see why. The DVD case is not quite as fancy as the TOS (The Original Series) cases. The TNG case is supposed to resemble a TNG crew briefcase. The case opens to reveal the disc booklet inside a sleeve. Sliding the disc booklet out of the sleeve and flipping it open reveals a spread of 7 discs. There are 4 episodes per disc. However the last disc, disc 7, only has two episodes, for a grand total of 26 episodes (TOS has 8 Discs, 30 episodes). The rest of disc 7 is devoted to Star Trek interviews and trailers with the usual expected extras...and then some more. The episodes are ordered not in the sequence they where filmed, but in the sequence that they aired, however each episode has been numbered according to the order they where filmed in. This means on one disc you have shows 4, 2, 12 and 1, in that order although Season Three was aired fairly much according to the chronological produced order except for episode one and two which are switched around. The sound has also been remastered to 5:1 Dolby Digital! Since the show was shot in full frame, these dimensions are retained.Star Trek, The Next Generation (TNG), Season Two continued with the amazing impact TNG had when it was first broadcast but made it more Enterprise based with less beaming down than Season One. Season Three corrects this somewhat critical tilt with Season Two by reintroducing us to lots of planet based exploration stories... and good ones at that too. Season Three has a whole new opening sequence to improve on the first computer generated images of our solar system as Captain Picard utters the immortal words... `To baldly'... I mean... `To boldly go where no man'... I mean... `To boldly go where no one has gone before.'  It was the dawn of the 90s and since CGI had undergone some development, the improvements can be seen not only in the new opening sequence, but with better looking planets (complete with moving gaseous atmospheres) and major enhancements in particle effects. Towards the end it undergoes new model development, lighting and subspace effects of a movie budget look. The crew uniform has changed with a new type of collar. Most of the main characters from Season Two are here, Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Commander William T. Riker (now with a bigger belly), Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge, Lieutenant Commander Worf (letting his hair grow even more), Commander Deanna Troi (with more makeup, costume changes and even an aerobics outfit [that really isn't as good as it sounds]), Lieutenant Commander Data and Ensign Wesley Crusher (new hairdo). Dr. Beverly Crusher is back (initially with a terrible hairdo that gets better) and Doctor Katherine Pulaski has been dropped from the show never to reappear again. Pulaski's disappearance is not officially explained (in reality Diana Muldaur was told her character was not working and she was offered a role in L.A. Law instead. McFadden was asked to rejoin the series again) the crew do act like she has just left because her time was up with Dr. Crusher making reference to Pulaski's work in Episode four. Commander Lieutenant Tasha Yar makes a surprise guest appearance for one episode! Dwight Schultz (Murdoch from the A-Team) makes his first appearance as Lieutenant `Reg' Barkley, who would have a reoccurring role. Colm Meaney is here again as Miles Edward O'Brien, Navigation, doesn't have much of a role boost since Season Two, while the Whoopi Goldberg's Guinan character of the wise El Aurian, the bartender in 10 Forward, has her background further developed. Season Three of TNG is mostly about nanotechnology, colonization, super aliens, the prime directive, orphans, ancient space booby traps, Romulans, wormholes, peace negotiations, defectors, super humans, terrorism, Q, court inquisitions, parallel universes, AI, Klingon high councils, captivity experiments, time travellers, biological space crafts, morale, the first law of robotics, Vulcans, Sarek, evolutionary speciation, and the Borg. Unlike Season Two there is much more planetary exploration and lots of alien encounters. There are loads of unforgettable episodes in this Season, ""Evolution"" where nanotechnology takes over the Enterprise, ""The Survivors"" is a mystery about a single household that is the only structure to survive an alien invasion on a whole planet, ""Who Watches The Watchers?"" is about the prime directive failing when the Enterprise team are spotted and kidnapped, ""Offspring"" sees Data creating another sentient android, ""Sins of the Father"" has Worf return to his Klingon homeworld to defend his family honour, ""Hollow Pursuits"" has Lt. Barkley fantasizing about crew members in the Holodeck, ""Sarek"" is about the Vulcan of the same name from Star Trek: The Original Series, who is back for what looks like his final peace negotiation, and of course the pot-boiler end episode of ""The Best of Both Worlds, Part I"" (widely acclaimed as one of the best Star Trek episodes ever!) marks the grand entrance of Locutus of Borg onto the scene. The bottom line for TNG: Season Three is that it is often cited by fans as the best TNG Season and is probably the first of the Seasons to really be worth the price tag demanded of these very expensive box sets. In Season Three everyone seems to have matured, included the writers who are giving us exactly what we want and the series has a serious enough budget to make every episode look like a movie, especially towards the end. There is lots in this season to enjoy and of course not since J.R. Ewing had been shot did we get the kind of cliff-hanger episode that ""The Best of Both Worlds, Part I"" would deliver on, meaning every Trekie (and who wasn't at this time) across the planet from LA to Hong Kong had to wait all summer to learn how Picard could be saved. There is no time to loose!!! Onto Season Four.... wooosshhhh.",5,"""I am Locutus of Borg.

696295,A2MC92RFN9RJQI,B000063V8R,"Paul Mackie ""pmacattack84""","[4, 4]","After two OK seasons, Star Trek: The Next Generation finally hits its stride in the third season. When people mention that this is one of the greatest TV shows ever made, the third season is what they're talking about. Each episode is crisply written, well-plotted, and multilayered. The show's powers have grown enough to take on more of the massive and difficult-to-film topics that the second season hit only intermittently. All around, the show has finally become completely consistent and satisfying.Character-wise, season 3 continues the developments introduced in season 2. Riker remains the risk-taker, and Data's arc toward humanity is developed wonderfully, especially in The Offspring. First-season casualty Tasha Yar makes her first of several reappearances in Yesterday's Enterprise, generally considered one of the best TNG episodes (though considered overrated by myself). The tension between Worf's Klingon heritage and Starfleet commission is explored in greater detail, especially in Sins of the Father.Most every episode in this season is at least entertaining, and picking highlights is difficult. Who Watches The Watchers is a beautiful and suspenseful treatment of Trek's most difficult dilemma - accidental human interference in a developing culture. The Defector features a dangerous political game between the Federation and the longtime antagonist Romulans. The Hunted is an extremely action-heavy episode with a twist of meaning between the numerous fights and chases. The Offspring is an excellent companion piece to season 2's The Measure of a Man, with less intellectual depth but more emotional resonance. Captain's Holiday introduces a new facet to Picard's often-muted personality.About the season finale, The Best of Both Worlds, a great deal has been said. This was one of the first TV cliffhangers to go between two seasons, and certainly one of the most effective as well. It's a bold stroke, and the final line of the season is guaranteed to stick in your head until the episode's resolution at the beginning of Season 4. All in all, this is the first essential season of this excellent sci-fi show. Highly recommended. Just be warned, if you're in for this one, you'll be in for Season 4 as well.",5,"Consistent at last, with greatness around every corner",1153872000,"07 26, 2006",2006,2235,"['two', 'OK', 'seasons', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', 'finally', 'stride', 'third', 'season', 'When', 'people', 'mention', 'one', 'greatest', 'TV', 'shows', 'ever', 'made', 'third', 'season', 'what', ""'re"", 'talking', 'episode', 'crisply', 'written', 'well-plotted', 'multilayered', 'show', 'powers', 'have', 'grown', 'enough', 'take', 'more', 'massive', 'difficult-to-film', 'topics', 'second', 'season', 'hit', 'only', 'intermittently', 'show', 'finally', 'become', 'completely', 'consistent', 'satisfying.Character-wise', 'season', '3', 'developments', 'introduced', 'season', '2', 'Riker', 'risk-taker', 'Data', 'arc', 'humanity', 'developed', 'wonderfully', 'especially', 'Offspring', 'First-season', 'casualty', 'Tasha', 'Yar', 'first', 'several', 'reappearances', 'Yesterday', 'Enterprise', 'generally', 'considered', 'one', 'best', 'TNG', 'episodes', 'considered', 'overrated', 'tension', 'Worf', 'Klingon', 'heritage', 'Starfleet', 'commission', 'explored', 'greater', 'detail', 'especially', 'Sins', 'Father.Most', 'episode', 'season', 'least', 'entertaining', 'picking', 'highlights', 'difficult', 'Who', 'Watchers', 'beautiful', 'suspenseful', 'treatment', 'Trek', 'most', 'difficult', 'dilemma', 'accidental', 'human', 'interference', 'developing', 'culture', 'Defector', 'dangerous', 'political', 'game', 'Federation', 'longtime', 'antagonist', 'Romulans', 'Hunted', 'extremely', 'action-heavy', 'episode', 'twist', 'meaning', 'numerous', 'fights', 'chases', 'Offspring', 'excellent', 'companion', 'piece', 'season', '2', 'Measure', 'Man', 'less', 'intellectual', 'depth', 'more', 'emotional', 'resonance', 'Captain', 'Holiday', 'new', 'facet', 'Picard', 'often-muted', 'season', 'finale', 'Best', 'Worlds', 'great', 'deal', 'been', 'said', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'TV', 'cliffhangers', 'go', 'two', 'seasons', 'certainly', 'one', 'most', 'effective', 'as', 'well', 'bold', 'stroke', 'final', 'line', 'season', 'guaranteed', 'stick', 'head', 'episode', 'resolution', 'beginning', 'Season', '4', 'first', 'essential', 'season', 'excellent', 'sci-fi', 'show', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'Just', 'be', 'warned', ""'re"", 'one', ""'ll"", 'be', 'Season', '4', 'as', 'well']",Star Trek The Next Generation - The Complete Third Season

696310,AUV0EFKWA46TX,B000063V8R,shaxper,"[2, 2]","""There are times, sir, when men of good conscience cannot blindly follow orders.""-- Jean Luc Picard to Admiral Haftel, ""The Offspring""Of all the Next Generation seasons, Three may be the most difficult one to define.  It's easy to point out the fact that it's a far more polished season than its predecessors, featuring immensely superior production values in terms of lighting, color balance, and costumes that lend a more dignified look to the show.  Beyond that though, things get muddled.Season Three undergoes a massive change of identity, most likely due in part to the arrival of new head writer Michael Pillar and a change of executive producers as Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry let go of the reigns due to his declining health.  The new guard behind Next Gen seemed very concerned with making Trek more respectable and less fantastic.  So, while the production values were enhanced to bring about this affect, the direction of the series seemed to follow, largely de-emphasizing the prominence of science fiction in most episodes (with several notable exceptions) and honing in, instead, on political, ethical, and personal drama.This works amazingly well in several groundbreaking episodes including ""The Survivors,"" ""Who Watches the Watchers?"" ""The Enemy,"" ""The Defector,"" ""Booby Trap,"" ""The Offspring,"" and ""Sins of the Father"".  The Offspring, in particular, is one of the most powerful dramatic episodes in the entire Star Trek franchise, while ""Sins of the Father"" lays the basis for Worf's personal struggles throughout his tenure on Next Generation and Deep Space Nine.There are also several episodes that play up a more character-rich and light-hearted side of Trek, including Luwaxana Troi's abduction by ogling Ferengi in ""Menege a Troi,"" Q's amusing tenure as an ordinary human in ""Deja Q,"" and Picard's less than laid back vacation in ""Captain's Holiday.""Unfortunately, this season also contains many relatively dull and dreary episodes that necessarily result from this first attempt to lend more dignity and restraint to a formerly far-out science fiction series.  It's difficult to decide how to fill 45 minutes of episode run time when the phasers aren't firing and there's no hostile force threatening the ship. As a result, while I'd be hesitant to call any episode in this season bad, there are many that I simply consider skippable.  Each has a strong concept at its center, but most simply run too long and fail to provide enough dramatic action.However, just as Next Gen is beginning to feel almost uncomfortably restrained in this season, the writers deliver two of the series' best remembered fantastic science fiction premises: ""Yesterday's Enterprise,"" and ""The Best of Both Worlds P.1"".  Both are, perhaps, so utterly successful because they blend the fantastic with rich, realistic human drama and polished, respectable production values. Even if the rest of the season were a total wash, these two episodes would warrant the purchase of this volume by themselves, clearly benefiting from all that the new creative team brought to this season.Finally, by the end, Season 3 achieves a new apex of excellence for Star Trek, delivering balanced episodes with compelling human drama at their core while framed by solid, enjoyable science fiction premises operating in the background.  The strongest of these are ""Hollow Pursuits,"" which introduces us to the unforgettable Reginald Barkley, and ""Sarek,"" in which Mark Lenard reprises his role from the original series.  Then, of course, the series concludes with the already mentioned ""Best of Both Worlds p.1"" which, though primarily centered on an action-intensive plot, does incorporate significant emotional drama for the characters and viewers alike.So, while Season Three brings production values, realism, and political and personal drama to the next level, the end result is uneven.  There are many dull moments in this season, yet one can't deny the quantity of exceptional episodes that are spaced out between them.

The interior folder for the DVDs, the small fold out booklet, and the listing of which episode is on which DVD is the same as the other two seasons. The difference happens when you put the DVD in. Instead of showing clips of the episodes one after another, the screen is divided into four sections, with clips of each episode playing simultaneously. I think this is a nice change, it's a bit distracting to try and watch all four sets of clips, but if you're looking for one episode in particular, this cuts down on the waiting.The third season is essentially like the first two, there's special features on the last DVD, and the episodes are laid out the same way on each disk.

696315,A2KA60QZUBJ6OH,B000063V8R,Stephen Eutsey,"[73, 80]","Is this the same TNG? Wow, so much so that I think fans often look back at season 3 as what propelled the show to its legendary status. Lets review the changes: first, it appears that many of the officers get new quarters. Data's quarters in seasons 1 and 2 resemble a receiving room in an airport hangar; here he and everyone else get really nice, spatious living areas. The uniforms have been mentioned by a number of people: they go from tight stretched, peel-off-to-undress-looking T-shirts and tights to collared, sweatshirt-resembling uniforms without that annoying seam down the middle of the chest. Now there is a place for command rank pips (there's a 1st season episode where Picard's pips are bunched together at one end and spread out at the other end!). There is a new and better title sequence. The crew begin to settle into their positions and pesonalities as well. Troi is more at ease, her empathic powers more even and toned down. Geordi, perhaps my favorite of the characters, settles into his chief of engineering position for good (in season 1, you never knew what the crew would be doing each episode - Data might be chief of security and Worf the transporter chief). Q is back and isn't so malevolent as in the 1st and 2nd seasons; he becomes more of a trickster character from here on through Voyager. Riker and Picard are more trusting of each other, and thank goodness Dr. Crusher is back to stay! Why didn't Dr. Pulaski work out? Because she was supposed to be like Dr. McCoy. Two things are wrong with that: no one could ever be like Dr. McCoy, and the restriction banning any personal conflict between characters was still in place then.That leads me to say as well that what helped the show this season more than anything was the stability in the front office. The new staff shifted focus from quasi political stuff to harder science fiction. The ""We're perfect in the 24th century"" thing is vitually non existant from here on out too, or at least its not as in your face. Starfleet indeed takes on more of a military feel (why else would a ship have multiple phaser banks and 150 photon torpedoes?) from the Picard attitude of ""Oh no, we're not the military!"" in season 2. This is all why Voyager is such a favorite of mine - it's a little more wild, willing to do stuff you would never have seen in TNG.There aren't any real clunker episodes in the third season; it gets off to a bit of a slow start, but those first several episodes are very focused and have a lot of dramatic quality. ""Sarek,"" ""Allegiance,"" ""The Enemy,"" ""The Defector,"" ""Sins of the Father,"" ""The Offspring,"" and ""The Best of Both Worlds, part I"" are top notch in one of TNG's top notch seasons. We learn much about Worf as an individual in ""The Enemy,"" including his prejudices. Worf fans will love it as well as ""Sins of the Father."" Action/suspense fans will enjoy ""Booby Trap,"" ""The High Ground,"" and ""Yesterday's Enterprise."" Drama critics will go wild over ""Sarek,"" one of the finest actor's scripts to date. There is a lot in season 3; I recommend it highly. For those who haven't seen these box sets yet, they're stunning. The picture quality of these episodes is far above and beyond anything you've seen on the VHS versions.",5,The measuring stick for the rest of the series,1017360000,"03 29, 2002",2002,3235,"['same', 'TNG', 'Wow', 'so', 'much', 'think', 'fans', 'often', 'look', 'back', 'season', '3', 'what', 'propelled', 'show', 'legendary', 'status', 'review', 'changes', 'first', 'many', 'officers', 'get', 'new', 'quarters', 'Data', 'quarters', 'seasons', '1', '2', 'resemble', 'receiving', 'room', 'airport', 'hangar', 'here', 'everyone', 'else', 'get', 'really', 'nice', 'spatious', 'living', 'areas', 'uniforms', 'have', 'been', 'mentioned', 'number', 'people', 'go', 'tight', 'stretched', 'peel-off-to-undress-looking', 'T-shirts', 'tights', 'collared', 'sweatshirt-resembling', 'uniforms', 'annoying', 'seam', 'middle', 'chest', 'Now', 'place', 'command', 'rank', 'pips', '1st', 'season', 'episode', 'where', 'Picard', 'pips', 'are', 'bunched', 'together', 'one', 'end', 'spread', 'out', 'other', 'end', 'new', 'better', 'title', 'sequence', 'crew', 'begin', 'settle', 'positions', 'pesonalities', 'as', 'well', 'Troi', 'more', 'ease', 'empathic', 'powers', 'more', 'even', 'toned', 'down', 'Geordi', 'perhaps', 'favorite', 'characters', 'settles', 'chief', 'engineering', 'position', 'good', 'season', '1', 'never', 'knew', 'what', 'crew', 'would', 'be', 'doing', 'episode', 'Data', 'might', 'be', 'chief', 'security', 'Worf', 'transporter', 'chief', 'Q', 'back', ""n't"", 'so', 'malevolent', '1st', '2nd', 'seasons', 'more', 'trickster', 'character', 'here', 'Voyager', 'Riker', 'Picard', 'are', 'more', 'trusting', 'other', 'thank', 'goodness', 'Dr.', 'Crusher', 'back', 'stay', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'Dr.', 'Pulaski', 'work', 'out', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'Dr.', 'McCoy', 'Two', 'things', 'are', 'wrong', 'one', 'could', 'ever', 'be', 'Dr.', 'McCoy', 'restriction', 'banning', 'personal', 'conflict', 'characters', 'was', 'still', 'place', 'then.That', 'say', 'as', 'well', 'what', 'helped', 'show', 'season', 'more', 'anything', 'was', 'stability', 'front', 'office', 'new', 'staff', 'shifted', 'focus', 'quasi', 'political', 'stuff', 'harder', 'science', 'fiction', ""'re"", 'perfect', '24th', 'century', 'thing', 'vitually', 'non', 'existant', 'here', 'out', 'too', 'least', 'not', 'face', 'Starfleet', 'indeed', 'more', 'military', 'feel', 'why', 'else', 'would', 'ship', 'have', 'multiple', 'phaser', 'banks', '150', 'photon', 'torpedoes', 'Picard', 'attitude', 'Oh', ""'re"", 'not', 'military', 'season', '2', 'why', 'Voyager', 'such', 'favorite', 'mine', 'little', 'more', 'wild', 'willing', 'do', 'stuff', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'seen', 'TNG.There', 'are', ""n't"", 'real', 'clunker', 'episodes', 'third', 'season', 'off', 'bit', 'slow', 'start', 'first', 'several', 'episodes', 'are', 'very', 'focused', 'have', 'lot', 'dramatic', 'quality', 'Sarek', 'Allegiance', 'Enemy', 'Defector', 'Sins', 'Father', 'Offspring', 'Best', 'Worlds', 'part', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'one', 'TNG', 'top', 'notch', 'seasons', 'learn', 'much', 'about', 'Worf', 'individual', 'Enemy', 'including', 'prejudices', 'Worf', 'fans', 'will', 'love', 'as', 'well', 'Sins', 'Father', 'Action/suspense', 'fans', 'will', 'enjoy', 'Booby', 'Trap', 'High', 'Ground', 'Yesterday', 'Enterprise', 'Drama', 'critics', 'will', 'go', 'wild', 'Sarek', 'one', 'finest', 'actor', 'scripts', 'date', 'lot', 'season', '3', 'recommend', 'highly', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'box', 'sets', 'yet', ""'re"", 'stunning', 'picture', 'quality', 'episodes', 'far', 'above', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'VHS', 'versions']",Star Trek The Next Generation - The Complete Third Season

The fact that they've gone back to the original film elements, and continue to do so, amazes me endlessly. I realize ST:TNG is a television staple, a legend, but the amount of work they've put into it really shows that CBS really cares (and knows how to make money).Video:Amazing. There are some scenes here and there that suffer from some softness, but the quality level is so much higher than any previous release that the only thing you can attribute this to is the original masters.Audio:I noticed an episode or 2 where the lips weren't synching correctly. This was on the 5.1 and the stereo audio. I know it is an issue with the audio on specific issues because all the other episodes on the discs were fine. And it was really only a couple of scenes affected. I'm not sure what happened there, and this is the only spot where I was even remotely disappointed. Still, it sounds phenomenal and a little adjustment on my receiver corrected the lag.Extras:The extras aren't as spectacular as the other seasons have been. That being said, what is here is worth watching. The Departmental Reviews are all worth watching and give more insight on several episodes. The Michael Piller homage is really well done as well. Also worth watching is the writers being pulled back into a room together for a new look back on the writing process.Overall:Even though season 2 was slightly disappointing in the effort put in for replicating the original show, it was still a stellar release. CBS seem to have hit their stride and now they have what I can only describe as the &#34;perfect&#34; season on Blu Ray so far.

We did not know that this nights episode was the season ending cliffhanger &#34;The Best Of Both Worlds&#34; pt 1 . Wow ! I was hooked and could not wait til the next season . Over the summer I watched the reruns of season 3 . At first I felt that some of the episodes were a little dull , but I found myself getting to like the characters , just like in the original series . Then I really began to like the show . After seeing the episode &#34;Yesterdays Enterprise&#34; I new this series could end up being as good as the original series . The creators found their mojo . Season 4 began the following season and it was one great episode after another until the series ended . Is TNG better that the original crew ? WHO CARES ! To be able to create two outstanding series based on the Enterprise is truely an amazing achievement . The bluray edition is wonderful . Since I already own season 3 on dvd I can tell you the picture quality is Improved . As with the dvd , picture quality varies and sometimes within the same episode . The new DTS Master Audio is fantastic . One thing I always like about the audio is the engine hum you hear whenever they are on the Enterprise . It's just one of those little things that make it seem more believable .The DTS mix is about the same as the dvd as far as channel seperation is concerned , but the audio has more impact on the bluray . Looking back I can't believe this show almost got past me . But then again , I was also a late-comer to &#34;Lost&#34; and &#34;Seinfeld&#34; .

After a DISASTEROUS first season, and a not much better second season, who would have thought that Next Generation's third season would be a tour-de-force of great acting and storytelling? And yet, that's exactly what happened. Coming off the writers' strike of season 2, Season 3 roared out of the gate with the return of Gates McFadden as Dr. Crusher. Season 2 had seen Crusher replace by the hated Dr. Pulaski, whose Enterprise tenure was thankfully only one season. In addition, Whoopie Goldberg as Guinan was featured prominently as a supporting character in this season, which added immeasurably to the ensemble cast dynamic. The introduction of Worf's continuing Klingon saga in this season was the start of Next Generation's continuing storylines, and the dark nature of the Klingon story arc was fantastic. In addition, the scriptwriters and the actors finally 'found' the characters after two wildly uneven seasons, and the classic portrayal of the Next Generation characters would begin right here in season 3. The true shining moments of season 3, however, are the cliffhanger season finale (which truly introduces the Borg after a cameo appearance in season 2), and one of the greatest Star Trek episodes of all time: Yesterday's Enterprise (featuring the return of Denise Crosby as Tasha Yar). Add in the expanded characterization of all the main cast, the SUPERB storylines, and the fact that there is not a single bad (or even average!) episode in this season, and you get the finest single year Star Trek has ever seen. Season 3 single handedly turned Next Generation into a television legend. If you like sci-fi, Next Generation's season 3 is an absolute MUST OWN.

(So what's coming soon that's compelling people to buy these current sets?)Wish I could afford it; thanks to the prices of necessities gone up so much (food, shelter, and distilled petroleum products being slightly more important than Captain Picard standing around as if he hasn't spent a penny in decades...), $50 is still an effective $100 out of my pocket in the end.Don't get me wrong, the entire series IS fun and seasons 3 and beyond have their appreciable values as well; but they are a change...Evolution:  A terrific season opener that reintroduces Dr Crusher with aplomb.  Wesley starting the problem is a big boost too.The Ensigns of Command:  Another home-run with this entry of Picard having his hands full; fighting a stolid species of inflexible corporate bugs while finding means to persuade a bunch of colonists to vacate the planet that the inflexible corporate bugs claim ownership too.  Very good story indeed!The Survivors:  An oddball, but highly enjoyable and well cast.  Especially if you've never been keen on Troi.Who Watches the Watchers:  Badly dated and preachy, but it's got enough set pieces to remain worthy.The Bonding:  I think, as with When the Bough Breaks, this one features kids on it as a result of a candy bar write-in contest...  It's a bit soapy, and why the alien wants to cajole one little kid seems silly...Booby Trap:  Shades of season 2, but this one is back on form with good ideas; especially with seeding an idea to be followed up next season.  Though, in reality, the ship caught in the trap would not survive a thousand years...The Enemy:  Utterly perfect, with one problem:  No Vulcan, a race that is a blood-brother to the Romulans, has the blood type needed to save the captured Romulan - yet Worf, a Klingon - is the sole person who CAN save this Romulan?!  Talk about shoehorning rubbish science into a scenario that's otherwise excellent, even with the silly uberdrama...  Maybe he should donate some blood and have it transfused into a poodle and see if the poodle survives.  That's what it boils down to.The Price:  Even today, the romance subplot is heavyhanded, but the Ferengi get just desserts with their meddling.  :DThe Vengeance Factor:  Well done story about blood feud.The Defector:  I used to love this one, but rewatching it reveals the uberdrama petty soap opera it sadly is.  It DOES have potential and a few surprise twists, but Picard taking all that time to instill excess drama into a situation that warrants fast response?  At that point I'd be cheering for the opposing team!!The Hunted:  A decent parallel to Vietnam vets; and hasn't dated much by today's standards either.The High Ground:  Whew boy.  This anti-terrorism story doesn't fit well today.  It's too one-sided...Deja Q:  Another Q episode.  How can't it be good?!  CLASSIC!  Q becomes human and the interplay with the crew is classic.  Especially when Guinan hears about the development...  Picard saving Q's bacon by the end is to be expected, but well handled.A Matter of Perspective:  Pity we didn't have that in the terrorism story.  :rolleyes:  This one is far worse for having it...  best left forgotten.Yesterday's Enterprise:  Classic.  Nice to see Yar back.  Also sets up a concept to be revived later on, which all things considered is brilliant.The Offspring:  Remake of ""The Measure of a Man"" and the story, much like Lal, self-destructs because it's 100% derivative.Sins of the Father:  Continues the Worf saga.  Until season 6 then DS9, this saga is fun.Allegience:  Preachy and predictable, but has some nice set pieces.Captain's Holiday:  More Ferengi?  A few nice set pieces and comedic moments, but naah...Tin Man:  Another classic.  Reuses some f/x from Star Trek The Motion Picture, but it's easy to relate to Tam and especially To the Tin Man entity.Hollow Pursuits:  Unworthy of any spite accorded to it; and Dwight Schultz is inspired casting.  great story on a man who isn't like the rest of us.  Pity we don't get more background info on him, but it is highly underrated.The Most Toys:  Another well-handled gem.  The toy collector getting his just desserts in the end, too...  Great Data-centric story.Sarek:  A plot so good that it got reused in Deep Space 9...  Sarek comes aboard and Picard mindmelds because Sarek is past his prime...  also sets up for a later story too...Menage a Troi:  garbage.Transfigurations:  An anti-xenophobia story.  A typical entry but has its momenets.Best of Both Worlds:  A bit soapy at times, but there's no real reason to even begin to dislike it.  The Borg never improved after this story (apart from a novel released in 1991 that isn't considered canon...)",5,The best season of the lot?,1138406400,"01 28, 2006",2006,4867,"['DVDs', 'are', 'good',

696329,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B000063V8R,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[8, 8]","""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" truly hit its stride with the third season. With the addition of Ron Moore and others to the writing staff, the third season flew into uncharted territories with a series of strong stories, acting, direction, performances and episodes that dealt with morally complex issues such as terrorism, the definition of humanity and even an echo of Rashmon in one episode.The transfer done by CBS here is nothing short of exceptional. I did note some minor issues in two shots of ""The Hunted"" but that is the only episode so far in the set. Occasionally, some close ups are a bit soft but I suspect that has to do with the photography of the show for those shots.There is one shot uprezzed from the original videotape for ""The Survivors"" as the elements couldn't be found.The show finally settled on a film stock that would provide nice, sharp and vivid detail without the excessive grain of the first two seasons. That, along with a new director of photography, allowed the look of the show to be both distinctive, textured and rich something that wasn't as evident on the original DVDs or the original broadcast of the show.The restoration team has managed to find that fine balance between the darker textures of the show and bold colors of the show. The visual effects look top notch throughout and where the effects team that worked on the restoration for the planets, there's an astonishing level of detail.As with the first two seasons subtitles are provided in English and other multiple langauges and the menu allows you to select from many langauges as well for the show itself.The special features include a commentary on ""The Bonding"" by Ronald D. Moore, Michael and Denise Okuda; ""Yesterday's Enterprise"" by Ronald D. Moore, Ira Steven Behr, Michael & Denise Okuda plus another commentary track by director David Carson; ""The Offspring"" commentary by Rene Echevarria, Michael & Denise Okuda; ""Sins of the Father"" commentary by Ronald D. Moore, Dan Curry, Michael & Denise Okuda. We also get a number of terrific featurettes including ""Inside the Writer's Room"" moderated by Seth McFarlane and a three part documentary entitled ""Assimiliating Star Trek: The Next Generation"" both in HD. There are also tributes to the late writer Michael Piller, the scenes shot with the late David Rappaport for the episode ""The Most Toys"". We also get all the original episode promos as well as the special features from the original DVD sets.CBS has done a terrific job with this set making up for some of the shortcomings evident in the season two Blu-rays (and, despite those shortcomings, the season two set is still worth picking up)and the quality of this set continues to bode well for the rest of the sets in this set.Highly recommended.",5,Terrific looking third season on Blu-ray with nice extras including a great featurette on the writer's room,1367280000,"04 30, 2013",2013,2766,"['Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', 'truly', 'hit', 'stride', 'third', 'season', 'addition', 'Ron', 'Moore', 'others', 'writing', 'staff', 'third', 'season', 'flew', 'uncharted', 'territories', 'series', 'strong', 'stories', 'acting', 'direction', 'performances', 'episodes', 'dealt', 'morally', 'complex', 'issues', 'such', 'terrorism', 'definition', 'humanity', 'even', 'echo', 'Rashmon', 'one', 'episode.The', 'transfer', 'done', 'CBS', 'here', 'nothing', 'short', 'exceptional', 'did', 'note', 'minor', 'issues', 'two', 'shots', 'Hunted', 'only', 'episode', 'so', 'far', 'set', 'Occasionally', 'close', 'ups', 'are', 'bit', 'soft', 'suspect', 'do', 'photography', 'show', 'one', 'shot', 'uprezzed', 'original', 'videotape', 'Survivors', 'elements', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'found.The', 'show', 'finally', 'settled', 'film', 'stock', 'would', 'provide', 'nice', 'sharp', 'vivid', 'detail', 'excessive', 'grain', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'new', 'director', 'photography', 'allowed', 'look', 'show', 'be', 'distinctive', 'textured', 'rich', 'something', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'evident', 'original', 'DVDs', 'original', 'broadcast', 'show.The', 'restoration', 'team', 'managed', 'find', 'fine', 'balance', 'darker', 'textures', 'show', 'bold', 'colors', 'show', 'visual', 'effects', 'look', 'top', 'notch', 'where', 'effects', 'team', 'worked', 'restoration', 'planets', 'astonishing', 'level', 'detail.As', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'subtitles', 'are', 'provided', 'English', 'other', 'multiple', 'langauges', 'menu', 'select', 'many', 'langauges', 'as', 'well', 'show', 'special', 'features', 'include', 'commentary', 'Bonding', 'Ronald', 'D.', 'Moore', 'Michael', 'Denise', 'Okuda', 'Yesterday', 'Enterprise', 'Ronald', 'D.', 'Moore', 'Ira', 'Steven', 'Behr', 'Michael', 'Denise', 'Okuda', 'commentary', 'track', 'director', 'David', 'Carson', 'Offspring', 'commentary', 'Rene', 'Echevarria', 'Michael', 'Denise', 'Okuda', 'Sins', 'Father', 'commentary', 'Ronald', 'D.', 'Moore', 'Dan', 'Curry', 'Michael', 'Denise', 'Okuda', 'also', 'get', 'number', 'terrific', 'featurettes', 'including', 'Writer', 'Room', 'moderated', 'Seth', 'McFarlane', 'three', 'part', 'documentary', 'entitled', 'Assimiliating', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', 'HD', 'are', 'also', 'late', 'writer', 'Michael', 'Piller', 'scenes', 'shot', 'late', 'David', 'Rappaport', 'episode', 'Most', 'Toys', 'also', 'get', 'original', 'episode', 'promos', 'as', 'well', 'special', 'features', 'original', 'DVD', 'sets.CBS', 'done', 'terrific', 'job', 'set', 'making', 'up', 'shortcomings', 'evident', 'season', 'two', 'Blu-rays', 'shortcomings', 'season', 'two', 'set', 'still', 'worth', 'picking', 'up', 'quality', 'set', 'bode', 'well', 'rest', 'sets', 'set.Highly', 'recommended']",Star Trek The Next Generation - The Complete Third Season
