1385117,A2RVCF21L2NPU5,B0044LYRK0,"Cherise Kachelmuss ""Mom and More""","[15, 16]","My sons love Sid the Science Kid and this DVD is great because it contains two episodes, one of which is lots of singing!  The first episode entails a school holiday so Sid has all his friends and even teacher Suzy over to perform a mini-concert for mom, dad, and Zeke!  Each kid sings a song about their favorite science activity - weather, charts, wheels, and more!  The songs are simple for kids to understand and fun to listen to.  I love that my sons think they are watching a fun cartoon not realizing that they are learning from it.  The whole episode has so much singing and it is different since the whole episode takes place in Sid's house and not school.  The second episode is all about the weather and temperatures which is great now to watch with our crazy weather we are having!  It is a typical Sid the Science kid episode at school.  This DVD is very cute and I still cannot believe it is less than $7.00!",5,Very cute and fun!,1296345600,"01 30, 2011",2011,922,"['sons', 'love', 'Sid', 'Science', 'Kid', 'DVD', 'great', 'two', 'episodes', 'one', 'lots', 'singing', 'first', 'episode', 'school', 'holiday', 'so', 'Sid', 'friends', 'even', 'teacher', 'Suzy', 'perform', 'mini-concert', 'mom', 'dad', 'Zeke', 'kid', 'song', 'favorite', 'science', 'activity', 'weather', 'charts', 'wheels', 'more', 'songs', 'are', 'simple', 'kids', 'understand', 'fun', 'listen', 'love', 'sons', 'think', 'are', 'watching', 'fun', 'cartoon', 'not', 'realizing', 'are', 'learning', 'whole', 'episode', 'so', 'much', 'singing', 'different', 'whole', 'episode', 'place', 'Sid', 'house', 'not', 'school', 'second', 'episode', 'weather', 'temperatures', 'great', 'now', 'watch', 'crazy', 'weather', 'are', 'having', 'typical', 'Sid', 'Science', 'kid', 'episode', 'school', 'DVD', 'very', 'cute', 'still', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'less', '7.00']",Sid the Science Kid: Sid - Sid's Sing Along

The children act like very realistic children, May is all shy and scared to sing and then gets way too overenthusiastic just like every shy child that realizes singing in crowds is fun. But wow, Susie's dedication!
