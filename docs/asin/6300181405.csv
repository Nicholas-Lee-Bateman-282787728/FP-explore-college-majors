Dave is a late night disc jockey. He gets a request to play a song. After work he stops at a near empty bar [?] and meets Evelyn. Is this a coincidence? The next day Evelyn drops in to cook for Dave. Does she have a temper? We see more of Dave's life through his conversations. His friends are 'artistes'. [Living on their trust inheritance?] Has Dave befriended the wrong person? Is an emotional Evelyn obsessed with Dave? Is the relationship out of control? Has Dave's life suddenly become too complicated? Its certainly not his fault. Is Evelyn self-destructive? Why is she so alone? Dave's treatment of Evelyn seems like an example of Pavlovian conditioning.The film crawls along with dramatic intervals. Evelyn becomes more emotional and intrusive, disturbing Dave's business lunch. [Could she get professional help?] Soon Evelyn turns criminally violent. The police now have a case against Evelyn. Who is she? Dave knows nothing. Then he is back with his old girlfriend Tobie. There are shots of the Monterey Jazz Festival. [This pads out the film.] Evelyn says goodbye to Dave. Will she ever return? Will there be a shocking surprise at the end? Could someone who attacked a person be released so soon? Would a police officer expecting danger walk into the house unwary?

199167,A1PASRZ81DY9C,6300181405,Austin Somlo,"[1, 1]","Viewed: 1/04, 7/08Rate: 107/08: Play Misty for Me is a strong directional debut for Clint Eastwood who has learned well how a film ought to be made. He joins the ranks of great directors when it comes to the theory that accomplishing a successful horror/terror/suspenseful flick is a sign of a great director. And that turned out to be true as he has churned out unforgettable films. Play Misty for Me is a small, simple but brilliant picture about a female stalker who can't stop her ways until she is satisfied but is never content for more than a few seconds. Clint Eastwood plays a great Dave Garver, a real hip guy who has a mild temperament, until finally pushed to his limits and is forced to react differently than he is accustomed to. Jessica Walter did her character beautifully well...not exactly a Norman Bates but clearly psychotic. The resulting conflict makes Play Misty for Me an endearing, and also obscure, classic. There is a bit of Hitchcock about it, but what I saw was purely Clint Eastwood. The trademarks such as aerial views in the introduction and the beginning, the short, sweet confrontations; the capturing of seemingly a random scene (Monterey Jazz Festival), lots of background scenery, and the gathering of characters for small talks. When I was watching Play Misty for Me, it felt like a nice stroll through the park, exactly how a film should be. The elements needed to create terror were nicely crafted as I see the reactions on faces of each characters, a typical technique of 60's and 70's films. I loved the dialogues, most notable between Dave Garver and Al Monte, because there is smoothness about them. Personally, I've known a couple of girls that fit Evelyn's persona, and I can feel for Dave Garver. Stalkers are truly pain in the asses, and they are always tiring. When Evelyn attempted suicide or waved around the butcher's knife that did happen for one girl around me. It was so ridiculous that I had to elevate my mind onto another level in order to understand her. The ending is great, Clint's punching Evelyn in the face before she falls off the cliff. All in all, Play Misty for Me is a classic, no less. I wonder if this movie is the original of its concept. For the rating of Play Misty for Me, I've raised it from `8' to `10'.",5,The Film That Started It All for Clint the Director.,1284681600,"09 17, 2010",2010,2280,"['Viewed', '1/04', '7/08Rate', '107/08', 'Play', 'Misty', 'Me', 'strong', 'directional', 'debut', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'who', 'learned', 'well', 'how', 'film', 'ought', 'be', 'made', 'ranks', 'great', 'directors', 'when', 'theory', 'accomplishing', 'successful', 'horror/terror/suspenseful', 'flick', 'sign', 'great', 'director', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'true', 'churned', 'out', 'unforgettable', 'films', 'Play', 'Misty', 'Me', 'small', 'simple', 'brilliant', 'picture', 'female', 'stalker', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'ways', 'satisfied', 'never', 'content', 'more', 'few', 'seconds', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'great', 'Dave', 'Garver', 'real', 'hip', 'guy', 'who', 'mild', 'temperament', 'finally', 'pushed', 'limits', 'forced', 'react', 'differently', 'accustomed', 'Jessica', 'Walter', 'did', 'character', 'beautifully', 'well', 'not', 'exactly', 'Norman', 'Bates', 'clearly', 'psychotic', 'resulting', 'conflict', 'Play', 'Misty', 'Me', 'endearing', 'also', 'obscure', 'classic', 'bit', 'Hitchcock', 'what', 'saw', 'was', 'purely', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'trademarks', 'such', 'aerial', 'views', 'introduction', 'beginning', 'short', 'sweet', 'confrontations', 'capturing', 'seemingly', 'random', 'scene', 'Monterey', 'Jazz', 'Festival', 'lots', 'background', 'scenery', 'gathering', 'characters', 'small', 'talks', 'When', 'was', 'watching', 'Play', 'Misty', 'Me', 'felt', 'nice', 'stroll', 'park', 'exactly', 'how', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'elements', 'needed', 'create', 'terror', 'were', 'nicely', 'crafted', 'see', 'reactions', 'characters', 'typical', 'technique', '60', '70', 'films', 'loved', 'dialogues', 'most', 'notable', 'Dave', 'Garver', 'Al', 'Monte', 'smoothness', 'Personally', ""'ve"", 'known', 'couple', 'girls', 'fit', 'Evelyn', 'persona', 'can', 'feel', 'Dave', 'Garver', 'Stalkers', 'are', 'truly', 'pain', 'asses', 'are', 'always', 'tiring', 'When', 'Evelyn', 'attempted', 'suicide', 'waved', 'butcher', 'knife', 'did', 'happen', 'one', 'girl', 'was', 'so', 'ridiculous', 'had', 'elevate', 'mind', 'level', 'order', 'understand', 'ending', 'great', 'Clint', 'punching', 'Evelyn', 'face', 'cliff', 'Play', 'Misty', 'Me', 'classic', 'less', 'wonder', 'movie', 'original', 'concept', 'rating', 'Play', 'Misty', 'Me', ""'ve"", 'raised', '8', '10']",N/A

A rough and tough cowboy or cop, Eastwood here directs himself as a Karmel jazz DJ, Dave Garver, back when such figures where part of a genuine counter-culture. This move  is bold.The stalking part is great, as  is the backdrop of jazz and Calafornia bohemia. Phrases are planted all over: ""Everything is Everything, Baby""  Sideburns and bell-bottoms and West Coast boutique trimmings get more fun to watch as they go from a while ago to genuine history.Eastwood's friend and coleuge is a pot smoking African Amerian. No mention is made of race--now this is typical, but for a darling of macho reactionaries in 1970, this was daring. Still, it gives you the idea of how cool Clint has really always been--it was us who beleived the cartoon who were really unhip.There are parts that could be trimmed, the love scene, and it also seems implusable that Garver would put up with the stalking crap for that long: wet-nursing the women who just slit her writsts in your bathroom to minipulate you is not beleivable, in 1910, 1970, or 2010.But what does work is how this cool cucumber lets his stalker slowly tie him in knots. Ahead of its time here is that in 1970, people were trying to be ""understanding,"" and ""compasionate"" and mayhave seen the stalker as a lost soul, looking for love and comfort. But when Evalyn kills a cool cop and binds , gags, and cuts the hair of Garver's real girlfiend, it allows Eastwood to show how mean and hostile and disgusting this behavior is.For plot, retro-peeps and some genuine chills, this is just a fantastic film to watch",5,classic,1264723200,"01 29, 2010",2010,1803,"['Clint', 'Eastwood', 'course', 'moved', 'make', 'far', 'more', 'ressonent', 'films', 'Play', 'Misty', 'Me', '1970.But', 'several', 'qualities', 'make', 'film', 'man', 'trying', 'settle', 'down', 'being', 'stalked', 'one', 'night', 'stand', 'lunatic', 'Evalyn', 'Draper-classic', 'A', 'rough', 'tough', 'cowboy', 'cop', 'Eastwood', 'here', 'Karmel', 'jazz', 'DJ', 'Dave', 'Garver', 'back', 'when', 'such', 'figures', 'where', 'part', 'genuine', 'counter-culture', 'move', 'bold.The', 'stalking', 'part', 'great', 'backdrop', 'jazz', 'Calafornia', 'bohemia', 'Phrases', 'are', 'planted', 'Everything', 'Everything', 'Baby', 'Sideburns', 'bell-bottoms', 'West', 'Coast', 'boutique', 'trimmings', 'get', 'more', 'fun', 'watch', 'go', 'while', 'ago', 'genuine', 'history.Eastwood', 'friend', 'coleuge', 'pot', 'smoking', 'African', 'Amerian', 'mention', 'made', 'race', 'now', 'typical', 'darling', 'macho', 'reactionaries', '1970', 'was', 'daring', 'Still', 'idea', 'how', 'cool', 'Clint', 'really', 'always', 'been', 'was', 'who', 'beleived', 'cartoon', 'who', 'were', 'really', 'unhip.There', 'are', 'parts', 'could', 'be', 'trimmed', 'love', 'scene', 'also', 'implusable', 'Garver', 'would', 'put', 'up', 'stalking', 'crap', 'long', 'wet-nursing', 'women', 'who', 'just', 'slit', 'writsts', 'bathroom', 'minipulate', 'not', 'beleivable', '1910', '1970', '2010.But', 'what', 'work', 'how', 'cool', 'cucumber', 'stalker', 'slowly', 'tie', 'knots', 'Ahead', 'time', 'here', '1970', 'people', 'were', 'trying', 'be', 'understanding', 'compasionate', 'mayhave', 'seen', 'stalker', 'lost', 'soul', 'looking', 'love', 'comfort', 'when', 'Evalyn', 'cool', 'cop', 'binds', 'gags', 'hair', 'Garver', 'real', 'girlfiend', 'Eastwood', 'show', 'how', 'mean', 'hostile', 'disgusting', 'behavior', 'is.For', 'plot', 'retro-peeps', 'genuine', 'chills', 'just', 'fantastic', 'film', 'watch']",N/A

199181,A2NX99GVAX4TRP,6300181405,"Christopher J. Jarmick ""Word  Lover""","[7, 10]","Clint Eastwood  made an impressive directorial debut with 1971's Play Misty For Me.  He plays a popular Carmel, California disc jockey named Dave Garver who keeps getting requests to  ' play Misty for Me"" (as in Errol Garner classic Misty)--from an extremely sexy voiced female listener.  After a fight with his girlfriend Tobie (Donna Mills), D.J. Dave meets Evelyn (Jessica Walter) in a singles type bar.  She's the woman who's been requesting Misty.  They wind up in bed with the understanding it's  not going to lead to a relationship.  But Evelyn is a very disturbed and psychotic woman.  Even when Dave patches things up with Tobie, Evelyn won't leave him alone.Yes, you might call this the original Fatal Attraction.  It's a much better film though. Eastwood's Dave Garver is a Smooth Operator, a selfish womanizing cad.  It's worth noting that Eastwood the director does not give Eastwood the actor vanity project type starring roles.  Often he plays quirky, somewhat dark and flawed characters in the film's he directs.  While his DJ character in Misty doesn't deserve an almost murderous psychotic woman stalker in his life, he is certainly partly responsible for how the situation began.  In contrast, the character Michael Douglas plays in Fatal Attraction is mostly exonerated of wrong doing when he is portrayed by a psycho.  Several scenes are almost identical in both films (both women wind up slitting their wrists as a ploy for sympathy and understanding). .  Family values are over-emphasized in the ridiculously overly political correct Fatal Attraction.Play Misty for Me is not a perfect film and there's a couple of awkward sequences that simply don't work at all in the film, but Eastwood recovers from such scenes and makes some very good, and mature directorial choices as the film progresses.  In a nutshell:  Eastwood's performance is a little stiff and un-even; Carmel locations are beautifully photographed;  there's a  scene set at the real Monterrey Jazz Festival, The taught direction, the beautifully photographed Carmel locations ; a scene set at the real  Monterrey Jazz festival, Jessica Walter's harrowing, memorable performance and the tasty jazz on the soundtrack more than make up for Eastwood's un-even performance.  Roberta Flack's The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face quickly moved to the top of the charts after the film was released (it's featured in the film).Look fast and you'll see director Don Siegel appearing as a bartender.  In fact the story is that the first scene Eastwood shot as a director was the one with Siegel (who directed Eastwood in some of his best films including Dirty Harry, Escape from Alcatraz, Coogans Bluff and the Beguiled.) and supposedly after 11 takes he then told the cameraman to put film in the camera.  The idea for the script was by a former Malpaso production company secretary (Jo Heims) which was turned into the shooting script by Dean Riesner who worked on the Rawhide tv series and Coogan's bluff.  Eastwood finished the film ahead of schedule and about $50,000 under budget.ON DVDPlay Misty for Me is presented in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen.  The film does show some tell-tale signs of it's age and there are a few noticeable blemishes and visible grain on the print.  The colors look slightly over-saturated in a style that's more late 1940's then 1970's but it's a very warm intentional look. As with most 1970's films, close-ups in particular are not crisply detailed and have a slight soft focus look to them.  This is often the fault of older film-stock.Black levels have been adjusted but some blacks appear grayish during night scenes and colors get washed out.Over-all this DVD version of the film is much improved over previous video versions, with sharpness increased and graininess decreased throughout it's presentation.Yes the audio on the disc is presented in 2.0 mono.  It is one of the best sounding mono-soundtracks I've ever head and the Monterrey Jazz Festival sequence sounds so clear and crisp it's as if it was in stereo.  There's very little distortion or noise.  Some of the dialogue was obviously looped and has a different sound quality in some scenes than in others but that has to do with how it was originally recorded.  This was a very low budget film remember.",4,Play that Funky Jazz White Boy....,1003881600,"10 24, 2001",2001,4281,"['Clint', 'Eastwood', 'made', 'impressive', 'directorial', 'debut', '1971', 'Play', 'Misty', 'Me', 'popular', 'Carmel', 'California', 'disc', 'jockey', 'named', 'Dave', 'Garver', 'who', 'getting', 'requests', 'play', 'Misty', 'Me', 'Errol', 'Garner', 'classic', 'Misty', 'extremely', 'sexy', 'voiced', 'female', 'listener', 'fight', 'girlfriend', 'Tobie', 'Donna', 'Mills', 'D.J', 'Dave', 'meets', 'Evelyn', 'Jessica', 'Walter', 'singles', 'type', 'bar', 'woman', 'who', 'been', 'requesting', 'Misty', 'wind', 'up', 'bed', 'understanding', 'not', 'going', 'lead', 'relationship', 'Evelyn', 'very', 'disturbed', 'psychotic', 'woman', 'Even', 'when', 'Dave', 'patches', 'things', 'up', 'Tobie', 'Evelyn', 'wo', ""n't"", 'leave', 'alone.Yes', 'might', 'call', 'original', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'Eastwood', 'Dave', 'Garver', 'Smooth', 'Operator', 'selfish', 'womanizing', 'cad', 'worth', 'noting', 'Eastwood', 'director', 'not', 'give', 'Eastwood', 'actor', 'vanity', 'project', 'type', 'starring', 'roles', 'quirky', 'somewhat', 'dark', 'flawed', 'characters', 'film', 'DJ', 'character', 'Misty', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'almost', 'murderous', 'psychotic', 'woman', 'stalker', 'life', 'certainly', 'partly', 'responsible', 'how', 'situation', 'began', 'contrast', 'character', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'mostly', 'exonerated', 'wrong', 'doing', 'when', 'portrayed', 'psycho', 'Several', 'scenes', 'are', 'almost', 'identical', 'films', 'women', 'wind', 'up', 'slitting', 'wrists', 'ploy', 'sympathy', 'understanding', 'Family', 'values', 'are', 'over-emphasized', 'ridiculously', 'overly', 'political', 'correct', 'Fatal', 'Attraction.Play', 'Misty', 'Me', 'not', 'perfect', 'film', 'couple', 'awkward', 'sequences', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'film', 'Eastwood', 'recovers', 'such', 'scenes', 'very', 'good', 'mature', 'directorial', 'choices', 'film', 'nutshell', 'Eastwood', 'performance', 'little', 'stiff', 'un-even', 'Carmel', 'locations', 'are', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'scene', 'set', 'real', 'Monterrey', 'Jazz', 'Festival', 'taught', 'direction', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'Carmel', 'locations', 'scene', 'set', 'real', 'Monterrey', 'Jazz', 'festival', 'Jessica', 'Walter', 'harrowing', 'memorable', 'performance', 'tasty', 'jazz', 'soundtrack', 'more', 'make', 'up', 'Eastwood', 'un-even', 'performance', 'Roberta', 'Flack', 'First', 'Time', 'Ever', 'Saw', 'Your', 'Face', 'quickly', 'moved', 'top', 'charts', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'featured', 'film', '.Look', 'fast', ""'ll"", 'see', 'director', 'Don', 'Siegel', 'appearing', 'bartender', 'fact', 'story', 'first', 'scene', 'Eastwood', 'shot', 'director', 'was', 'one', 'Siegel', 'who', 'directed', 'Eastwood', 'best', 'films', 'including', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'Escape', 'Alcatraz', 'Coogans', 'Bluff', 'Beguiled', 'supposedly', '11', 'then', 'told', 'cameraman', 'put', 'film', 'camera', 'idea', 'script', 'was', 'former', 'Malpaso', 'production', 'company', 'secretary', 'Jo', 'Heims', 'was', 'turned', 'shooting', 'script', 'Dean', 'Riesner', 'who', 'worked', 'Rawhide', 'tv', 'series', 'Coogan', 'bluff', 'Eastwood', 'finished', 'film', 'ahead', 'schedule', '50,000', 'budget.ON', 'DVDPlay', 'Misty', 'Me', 'presented', '1.85:1', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'film', 'show', 'tell-tale', 'signs', 'age', 'are', 'few', 'noticeable', 'blemishes', 'visible', 'grain', 'print', 'colors', 'look', 'slightly', 'over-saturated', 'style', 'more', 'late', '1940', 'then', '1970', 'very', 'warm', 'intentional', 'look', 'most', '1970', 'films', 'close-ups', 'particular', 'are', 'not', 'crisply', 'detailed', 'have', 'slight', 'soft', 'focus', 'look', 'often', 'fault', 'older', 'film-stock.Black', 'levels', 'have', 'been', 'adjusted', 'blacks', 'appear', 'grayish', 'night', 'scenes', 'colors', 'get', 'washed', 'out.Over-all', 'DVD', 'version', 'film', 'much', 'improved', 'over', 'previous', 'video', 'versions', 'sharpness', 'increased', 'graininess', 'decreased', 'audio', 'disc', 'presented', '2.0', 'mono', 'one', 'best', 'sounding', 'mono-soundtracks', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'head', 'Monterrey', 'Jazz', 'Festival', 'sequence', 'so', 'clear', 'was', 'stereo', 'very', 'little', 'distortion', 'noise', 'dialogue', 'was', 'obviously', 'looped', 'different', 'sound', 'quality', 'scenes', 'others', 'do', 'how', 'was', 'originally', 'recorded', 'was', 'very', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'remember']",N/A

My memory centered on two things, the song Play Misty for Me and the bloody slashings. After watching the movie again I have renewed respect for it as a solid piece of movie making, and the song and the slashings still work. (As much as I like the song, I can never hear it without immediately thinking of the movie.) Sure, there are some smaller things that date the film, but it has a strong, uneasy story and the suspense holds up. The acting and the pace of the movie, to my mind, make it still a very watchable film. Like The Ipcress File, the strong components make the movie work.In particular, I was startled at just how strong an actor Jessica Walter is. When she revs up her psycho side, she just sweeps everything out of her way. There is something unnerving about Walter. She's a very attractive woman, but with her strong chin, straight mouth and eyes that seem to stare into you...without blinking...there's something hidden and hard.I like the way Eastwood isn't afraid to play next to strong actresses like Walter. He's not afraid to be vulnerable. His character here is more or less an average guy who gets more than he bargained for. A film of his I like a lot for the most part (as with this one) for much the same reason is Tightrope with Genevieve Bujold.I could have done with a little less slashing and little less blood, but on balance I think those are minor quibbles. The movie seems to me to be a well-crafted film and shows Eastwood knew what he was doing when he decided to get into directing.I watched one of the extras with the key people, including Eastwood and Walter, reminiscing about how the movie got made.

Jessica Walter's performance deserved an oscar. I still see her in my sleep - waving that knife around - just like she looks on the video jacket cover.The reason I really enjoy this movie is it just wreaks of 1971. I just love looking at the hair, the clothes, the decore. Not to mention the music. From Roberta Flack's &quot;First Time Ever I Saw Your Face&quot; to the cool jazz of the Monterey Jazz Festival.

That one scene where Clint is asleep, and then it seems as though he's dreaming about Jessica standing over him, and it's all still, but then she lunges forth with a knife, and blood curdling scream wakes him back into reality. This scene alone should've won the film an oscar for best picture as it's one of the all time scariest scenes in movie history. Clint plays a local dj who can't seem to keep his hormones under control, and is romanticizing 2 women at the same time, but the character played by Jessica Walter is taking it very seriously, so when Clint wants Donna Mills only Jessica doesn't seem to get the message, and anyone who gets in her way it would be better for them to commit suicide. The moods in this movie are rather dark as the lighting, and use of color reveal itself here. The music also shows a rather dark side as well. Roberta Flack's ""The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face"" is a love song, but it's just brought out in a dark light here.

Not quite. Sixteen years before Glenn Close ever boiled a bunny, Clint Eastwood made his directorial debut with ""Play Misty For Me.""

One night at a bar, he encounters a fan named Evelyn (Jessica Walter), who reveals that she is the caller who often requests the jazz song ""Misty."" They have a no-strings-attached fling... which starts getting uncomfortable when she starts showing up uninvited at his house, wrecking business meetings and even attempts suicide.Dave isn't entirely sure how to deal with Evelyn's increasingly violent, erratic behavior -- and after reconciling with his ex-girlfriend Tobie (Donna Mills), Evelyn wrecks his house and stabs his cleaning lady. For a time he thinks that he's finally escaped his stalker, but when Evelyn is released from police custody, Dave finds that she may be coming after him again... and this time, she wants him dead.Clint Eastwood is now almost as well-regarded a director as an actor, but how was he as a beginner? Well, ""Play Misty For Me"" is a solid start for him -- it has some rough bits, (that scene at the jazz festival just drags on and on...), but Eastwood shows a strong, suspenseful style that needed a little more refinement to reach its peak.At first Evelyn just seems weird and erratic, but as Dave tries to keep going about his life without her, she gets wilder and more violent. Eastwood slowly, methodically starts piling on the suspense, splattered with occasional moments of horrifying violence -- Evelyn's attack on Birdie is terrifying in its jagged, chaotic viciousness. Throw in some Edgar Allen Poe and the occasional knife attack, and you have a pretty suspenseful little thriller.However, Eastwood WAS still a first-time director, and there are a few bad spots. The romantic scenes are just wretched -- sitting in front of a sunset, or having very slow sex in a waterfall? That's ""Twilight""-level cheese!He also had the guts to cast himself in a not-very-sympathetic role. Though Dave is a victim, he's also a detached, promiscuous guy who sorta kinda brings the whole disaster on himself, and thinks little of hooking up with Evelyn despite clearly intending to end up with Tobie. And at the same time, he's not a vicious person -- you can see his pities Evelyn and regrets this whole mess, even as he wants to protect Tobie from her.Sadly Eastwood doesn't have much chemistry with Donna Mills, although she does a serviceable job as Tobie. He does far better opposite Walter, who gives a riveting, spooky performance as Evelyn -- she seems all kittenish and devoted... until she transforms into a violent screeching harpy. From there, she gets cold and cruel.""Play Misty For Me"" has some freshman flaws, but the direction shows a raw form of the intensity and skill that Eastwood would later perfect.

199197,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,6300181405,Erik North,"[2, 2]","Nowadays it's probably quite easy to take for granted that Clint Eastwood is a tremendous director and, let's be honest here, a really good actor too.  But little did audiences of 1971 who had seen him as the Man With No Name in those wacky, violent Sergio Leone spaghetti westerns of the 1960s, or as Dirty Harry, realize what talent the man had.  That talent truly took hold as a result of Eastwood's striking directing debut with PLAY MISTY FOR ME.Eastwood portrays a DJ at a jazz radio station in the seaside town of Carmel, California (where he was to become mayor for real in the 1980s) who one night gets a call from a mysterious woman to ""play Misty for me"" (referring to the Errol Garner classic).  It turns out that this woman (Jessica Walter) has become rather fixated with Eastwood and his penchant for spouting poetry on the air.  But ""fixated"" only touches the tip of the iceberg.  Eastwood's fairly stable life gets a little jolt when an old flame of his (Donna Mills) shows up back in town again, and he manages to rekindle that old flame.  This just accelerates Walter's now-jealous obsession with him; and when Eastwood's cleaning lady (Clarice Taylor) is almost slashed to death...well then, we are talking psychotic here.  He's not only being smothered by Walter; pretty soon, he is stalked by her as well.  It all comes down to a climax at Mills' isolated house, where Walter holds her hostage, and where a cop (John Larch) investigating her every move has been found dead.Working with a relatively small crew, a six-week production schedule, and a budget of only $900,000, Eastwood nevertheless overcame the limitations he had to work with and came up with one of the great horror/suspense thrillers of all times.  His direction clearly shows how much he had learned while having worked with Leone, as well as his DIRTY HARRY director Don Siegel (who makes an amusing cameo here as the local barkeep).  He also shows considerable range as an actor as well, being able to handle his romantic scenes with Mills and his more intense ones with Walter with equal skill.  The ominous cinematography of his long-time cameraman Bruce Surtees is just right for the Hitchcockian mood of the film--in particular, the scene in which Eastwood and Mills walk along the beach, with Roberta Flack's classic recording of ""The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face"" being heard on the soundtrack.  And special attention should be given to Walter, whose jealous woman role is positively frightening.Perhaps the one flaw of PLAY MISTY FOR ME (and, to an equal extent, the film that more or less was a remake of it, FATAL ATTRACTION), is a perceived misogyny on the part of Eastwood on either side of the camera.  Whether or not that is true is up to the viewer to decide.

We'd been watching the Dirty Harry and Western Series DVDs and, boy, does this represent  a change! Eastwood here plays a nighttime disc jockey operating out of Carmel, California. It's a beautiful setting and the photography is marvelous. In any case, he gets requests to ""Play Misty for Me"" and he complies. Ultimately the sultry and good looking woman tracks him down, and they begin an affair at just about the same time as Eastwood and another past flame are gradually getting back together. It's a bit complicated, but that adds to the story.The ""Play Misty"" woman gradually evolves into something of a friendly stalker and then grows into an increasingly unwanted pest who is very hard to get rid of. Alas, it reminded me of my past 50-year history as a bachelor. The stalker becomes more and more of a nut case and begins to interfere with the DJ's life in dramatic fashions. It's an erie tale and filled with a good deal of suspense and the deaths of several people. It's a bit of a nail biter, if you like that sort of thing. It will grab your attention and hold it, that's for certain. Very well done movie.

Much of this film is hopelessly dated and unintentionally funny: from Clint Eastwood's hip-hugger pants to a fellow DJ taking a &quot;toke&quot; on a joint. And Donna Mills' haircut is a 70's horror ! But the scenery in Carmel is gorgeous and adds to the ambiance.

Only after the &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; type conclusion do we see the Clint we all know and love.

199201,A2UYAFQ40U2PHS,6300181405,"Grigory's Girl ""GR""","[4, 4]","This is a damn fine picture, and it's Clint Eastwood's first film as a director. It's not Citizen Kane, but it isn't Fear and Desire (Kubrick's abysmal first film), or Pirahana 2: The Spawning, James Cameron's first feature. either. It's a very good film, and considering this was the first time Clint stepped behind a camera, he did a very good job. The story is quite contemporary as Clint is playing a DJ who beds a woman (played very well by Jessica Walker) who turns out to be a bit unstable and homicidal. The word stalker had not entered the American vocabulary at the time, but this is in fact what she was. It's a terrifying film, very well acted, directed, edited, and shot mostly on location (an Eastwood favorite). It's a fine debut.There's an interesting backstory behind this film. Clint has always had ambitions to direct, and he asked the studio heads at Universal if he could direct this film. They were understandably weary and cautious about letting an actor who had never directed before direct a film, but instead of Clint pulling the ""I'm the biggest actor in the world! DO AS I SAY!"" route, he told Universal he would do the film for no money, and take a percentage of the gross. Well, it turned out that Clint finished the movie early and under budget (he almost always does), and it was a box office hit, so Clint earned more from the gross than he would have from a straight salary.Clint was never really taken seriously as a director (at least by American critics) until Unforgiven. Many critics just thought of him as an actor who was just amusing himself by directing occasionally. The truth is that he was directing many of his own films after Play Misty for Me. Clint has only worked with 3 major directors (other than himself) in his career: Sergio Leone, Don Siegel (who has a cameo here), and Wolfgang Petersen (in the film In the Line of Fire). He's really unique in the film industry in that he really controls his own creativity, along the lines of Charlie Chaplin and Woody Allen (both of them rarely ever acted for others). Clint's remarkable career just keeps getting better, as he has a new film due out (Changeling), and one due out not too far after that (Gran Torino). So it turns out Clint was a much better artist than most made him out to be, and he keeps getting better and better.",4,Excellent directorial debut from Clint...,1224547200,"10 21, 2008",2008,2329,"['damn', 'fine', 'picture', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'first', 'film', 'director', 'not', 'Citizen', 'Kane', ""n't"", 'Fear', 'Desire', 'Kubrick', 'abysmal', 'first', 'film', 'Pirahana', '2', 'Spawning', 'James', 'Cameron', 'first', 'feature', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'considering', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'Clint', 'stepped', 'camera', 'did', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'story', 'quite', 'contemporary', 'Clint', 'playing', 'DJ', 'who', 'woman', 'played', 'very', 'well', 'Jessica', 'Walker', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'bit', 'unstable', 'homicidal', 'word', 'stalker', 'had', 'not', 'entered', 'American', 'vocabulary', 'time', 'fact', 'what', 'was', 'terrifying', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'acted', 'directed', 'edited', 'shot', 'mostly', 'location', 'Eastwood', 'favorite', 'fine', 'debut.There', 'interesting', 'backstory', 'film', 'Clint', 'always', 'had', 'ambitions', 'direct', 'asked', 'studio', 'heads', 'Universal', 'could', 'direct', 'film', 'were', 'understandably', 'weary', 'cautious', 'letting', 'actor', 'who', 'had', 'never', 'directed', 'direct', 'film', 'instead', 'Clint', 'pulling', ""'m"", 'biggest', 'actor', 'world', 'DO', 'SAY', 'route', 'told', 'Universal', 'would', 'do', 'film', 'money', 'take', 'percentage', 'gross', 'Well', 'turned', 'out', 'Clint', 'finished', 'movie', 'early', 'budget', 'almost', 'always', 'was', 'box', 'office', 'hit', 'so', 'Clint', 'earned', 'more', 'gross', 'would', 'have', 'straight', 'salary.Clint', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'taken', 'seriously', 'director', 'least', 'American', 'critics', 'Unforgiven', 'Many', 'critics', 'just', 'thought', 'actor', 'who', 'was', 'just', 'amusing', 'directing', 'occasionally', 'truth', 'was', 'directing', 'many', 'own', 'films', 'Play', 'Misty', 'Me', 'Clint', 'only', 'worked', '3', 'major', 'directors', 'other', 'career', 'Sergio', 'Leone', 'Don', 'Siegel', 'who', 'cameo', 'here', 'Wolfgang', 'Petersen', 'film', 'Line', 'Fire', 'really', 'unique', 'film', 'industry', 'really', 'own', 'creativity', 'lines', 'Charlie', 'Chaplin', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'rarely', 'ever', 'acted', 'others', 'Clint', 'remarkable', 'career', 'just', 'getting', 'better', 'new', 'film', 'due', 'Changeling', 'one', 'due', 'not', 'too', 'far', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'out', 'Clint', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'artist', 'most', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'getting', 'better', 'better']",N/A

For quite some time during his acting career, going back to the days he starred in the TV series ""Rawhide"", Eastwood has a big interest in directing. With ""Misty"" the chance to show what he could do behind the camera finally presented itself. And for his directing debut Clint Eastwood would show he had a promising future as a director. With movies like ""Unforgiven"", ""The Outlaw Josie Wales"", ""Million Dollar Baby"" and ""Gran Torino"" among the films he has directed Clint has had a career so far many movie directors would love to have themselves.Not only is this a great directing debut but the story line is gripping, suspenseful and on the edge of your seat anticipation that can keep an audience wondering what is going to happen next and who is going to get hurt as the result. It is the kind of story that if you didn't know that Eastwood was the director you would almost swear this is a Hitchcock film you are watching. Include the fact that Eastwood gives an outstanding performance as the lead actor in the movie in addition to proving what a great director he would come to be makes his work in this film all the more amazing. Make no mistake though, the real star of this movie is Jessica Walters who plays the psychotic, control freak Evelyn Draper who is responsible for bringing the terror to this suspenseful film. She plays her role so convincingly that it could scare any cheating husband into becoming very faithful to their wife.The movie has Clint Eastwood playing the roll of David Garver, a radio DJ for Jazz station KRML who gets numerous calls from a mysterious lady requesting the classic song ""Misty"". One night after work Garver stops by a local bar he frequents a lot and sees a pretty woman (Walters) sitting by herself at the end of the bar. With the help of his bartender friend Garver thinks he is setting a chance encounter to get to meet this pretty woman. What he doesn't know is this pretty woman is in fact stalking him and he will soon come to learn what a mistake he made in meeting this woman. Before he knows what is happening Evelyn is controlling everything in his life. Showing up at his doorstep at the most inopportune times and expecting that they are going out on a date. To complicate things even more Garver meets up with his old girlfriend and old feelings between the two soon start to reappear again. All the while though stalking close behind is Evelyn. What started out as a casual relationship, or so David thought, becomes a millstone for him as Evelyn more and more tries to control every aspect of his life. When he reaches the point he can't take it anymore and tries to confront Evelyn to end the relationship she attempts suicide to regain control over David. When he does finally break off things with her Evelyn enters his house while he is away and trashes the place and nearly kills the cleaning lady in the process.It looks like things will settle back down to normal with Evelyn hauled off to jail and David and Tobie, Garver's former girlfriend played by Donna Mills, start to pick up their relationship where it was left off. Until Evelyn is released from jail and there will be hell to pay. Eastwood keeps the tension building at just the right pace. Yes as other reviewers have pointed out there are moments where the movie drags a little. But I think Clint may actually have done that just to give the viewer a chance to catch their breath. The scene at the jazz festival may be a good case in point. What a better way to catch your breath and settle the nerves a bit after all that has happened up to that point then by listening for a few minutes to some great jazz music.All in all this is a great movie. One that I highly recommend especially if you love a good suspense movie or you simply are a big Clint Eastwood fan. I would certainly rate this one of his all time best films.",5,Eastwood Shows He Can Direct,1367107200,"04 28, 2013",2013,3983,"['Play', 'Misty', 'Me', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'best', 'movies', 'also', 'movie', 'where', 'made', 'directing', 'debut', 'quite', 'time', 'acting', 'career', 'going', 'back', 'days', 'starred', 'TV', 'series', 'Rawhide', 'Eastwood', 'big', 'interest', 'directing', 'Misty', 'chance', 'show', 'what', 'could', 'do', 'camera', 'finally', 'presented', 'directing', 'debut', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'would', 'show', 'had', 'promising', 'future', 'director', 'movies', 'Unforgiven', 'Outlaw', 'Josie', 'Wales', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'films', 'directed', 'Clint', 'had', 'career', 'so', 'far', 'many', 'movie', 'directors', 'would', 'love', 'have', 'themselves.Not', 'only', 'great', 'directing', 'debut', 'story', 'line', 'gripping', 'suspenseful', 'edge', 'seat', 'anticipation', 'can', 'keep', 'audience', 'wondering', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'who', 'going', 'get', 'hurt', 'result', 'kind', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'Eastwood', 'was', 'director', 'would', 'almost', 'swear', 'Hitchcock', 'film', 'are', 'watching', 'Include', 'fact', 'Eastwood', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'lead', 'actor', 'movie', 'addition', 'proving', 'what', 'great', 'director', 'would', 'come', 'be', 'work', 'film', 'more', 'amazing', 'Make', 'mistake', 'real', 'star', 'movie', 'Jessica', 'Walters', 'who', 'psychotic', 'control', 'freak', 'Evelyn', 'Draper', 'who', 'responsible', 'bringing', 'terror', 'suspenseful', 'film', 'role', 'so', 'convincingly', 'could', 'scare', 'cheating', 'husband', 'becoming', 'very', 'faithful', 'wife.The', 'movie', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'playing', 'roll', 'David', 'Garver', 'radio', 'DJ', 'Jazz', 'station', 'KRML', 'who', 'numerous', 'calls', 'mysterious', 'lady', 'requesting', 'classic', 'song', 'Misty', 'One', 'night', 'work', 'Garver', 'local', 'bar', 'lot', 'pretty', 'woman', 'Walters', 'sitting', 'end', 'bar', 'help', 'bartender', 'friend', 'Garver', 'setting', 'chance', 'encounter', 'get', 'meet', 'pretty', 'woman', 'What', ""n't"", 'know', 'pretty', 'woman', 'fact', 'stalking', 'will', 'soon', 'come', 'learn', 'what', 'mistake', 'made', 'meeting', 'woman', 'what', 'happening', 'Evelyn', 'controlling', 'everything', 'life', 'Showing', 'up', 'doorstep', 'most', 'inopportune', 'times', 'expecting', 'are', 'going', 'out', 'date', 'complicate', 'things', 'even', 'more', 'Garver', 'up', 'old', 'girlfriend', 'old', 'feelings', 'two', 'soon', 'start', 'reappear', 'again', 'while', 'stalking', 'close', 'behind', 'Evelyn', 'What', 'started', 'out', 'casual', 'relationship', 'so', 'David', 'thought', 'millstone', 'Evelyn', 'more', 'more', 'tries', 'control', 'aspect', 'life', 'When', 'point', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'anymore', 'tries', 'confront', 'Evelyn', 'end', 'relationship', 'suicide', 'regain', 'control', 'David', 'When', 'finally', 'break', 'off', 'things', 'Evelyn', 'house', 'away', 'place', 'nearly', 'cleaning', 'lady', 'process.It', 'looks', 'things', 'will', 'settle', 'back', 'down', 'normal', 'Evelyn', 'hauled', 'off', 'jail', 'David', 'Tobie', 'Garver', 'former', 'girlfriend', 'played', 'Donna', 'Mills', 'start', 'pick', 'up', 'relationship', 'where', 'was', 'left', 'off', 'Evelyn', 'released', 'jail', 'will', 'be', 'hell', 'pay', 'Eastwood', 'tension', 'building', 'just', 'right', 'pace', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'are', 'moments', 'where', 'movie', 'little', 'think', 'Clint', 'may', 'actually', 'have', 'done', 'just', 'give', 'viewer', 'chance', 'catch', 'breath', 'scene', 'jazz', 'festival', 'may', 'be', 'good', 'case', 'point', 'What', 'better', 'way', 'catch', 'breath', 'settle', 'nerves', 'bit', 'happened', 'up', 'point', 'then', 'listening', 'few', 'minutes', 'great', 'jazz', 'music.All', 'great', 'movie', 'One', 'highly', 'recommend', 'especially', 'love', 'good', 'suspense', 'movie', 'simply', 'are', 'big', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'fan', 'would', 'certainly', 'rate', 'one', 'time', 'best', 'films']",N/A
199210,A244CRJ2QSVLZ4,6300181405,J. B. Hoyos,"[3, 3]","""Play Misty For Me"" was Clint Eastwood's directorial debut, and what a debut!  This is a tense, powerful drama that is both suspenseful and horrifying.  Clint Eastwood is a playboy disc jockey who is seduced by the fan from Hell, played by Jessica Walter.  Walter should  have received an Oscar for her portrayal as a psychotic who can't get over the fact that Eastwood never has and never will love her.  The gorgeous Donna Mills (Surprise, she's not a bleached blonde in this movie!) plays Eastwood's nave girlfriend who is convinced by Eastwood to revive a relationship with him.  Big mistake!Filmed in beautiful Carmel, California (Eastwood's home town), ""Play Misty For Me"" is an emotional roller coaster ride.  It has many scenes between Eastwood and Walter that range from publicly embarrassing and humiliating to horrifying and tragic.  Wait until Walter begins wielding a large kitchen knife and commences to slice and dice everyone in Eastwood's life.  The ending was gruesome; it gave me a jolt.  It definitely caught me by surprise as it did the victim.""Fatal Attraction"" has scenes that mimic ""Play Misty For Me.""  It is not nearly as well done as the Eastwood hit.  Glenn Close's character is not nearly as nasty as Jessica Walter's.""Play Misty For Me."" is highly recommended for fans of horror and suspense and for fans of American icon, Clint Eastwood.  A higher body count would've been nicer, however, this movie relies more on suspense rather than gratuitous gore and violence.  Some of the scenes at the jazz festival dragged too long.

I love Clint Eastwood but didn't know much else about the film until I purchased it on DVD.  I had asked a guy I worked with what films he would classify as extremely horrific or scary.

He said that this film still gives him nightmares and that he can't sit through it without giving himself the creeps.I didn't understand why he felt this way until I finally bought the DVD and watched it again.  The film isn't scary in the traditional way you might think of a horror movie.  It's scary because of how real it is and how easily it catches you off guard.  The story in this movie could potentially happen anywhere to anyone.  The story line follows a psychotic woman who stalks a radio DJ (Eastwood) and falls deeper and deeper into insanity.

You definitely notice the era's style.  Clint Eastwood's ""big hair"" at the time rivaled his romantic interests and the clothes he wore were disco material.  It was the first film he directed, made in 1971, and definitely shows his ability to build tension and terror.Clint plays a handsome, purring voice radio disc jockey ""Dave"" who lives high on the cliffs of the beautiful California Pacific Coast.  We see him driving in his sports car to work and the local bar.  He gets persistent calls from a female to ""Play Misty for me,"" but he soon realizes she has a plan to suffocate him with her ownership of him and everything he does.  For some reason after many obvious signs she is crazy, he keeps catering to her instead of getting a restraining order.  Most level-headed men would not put up with her histrionics and inappropriate acts, but to make the story fly we have to suffer through several embarrassing scenes and tormented rages.

199235,A1GN8UJIZLCA59,6300181405,P Magnum,"[46, 48]","Play Misty For Me is Clint Eastwood's directorial debut and it is an entertaining thriller about obsession that is a precursor for films like Fatal Attraction.  Mr. Eastwood plays against type as a DJ Dave Garver, who works at a jazz station in Carmel, CA (The town where Mr. Eastwood would become the real life mayor ).  Mr. Eastwood is usually the strong, silent type who seeks revenge or is an enforcer.  In this film, he is a sensitive ladies man, who reads poetry on the air and plays jazz music.  He is also the victim.  He has what he thinks is a one-night affair with Evelyn Draper played by Jessica Walter.  Evelyn claims that there's no strings attached, but that turns out to be the farthest thing from the truth.  She stalks Garver, showing up unannounced at his home, at a bar he frequents and in one instance tries to kill herself in his bathroom.  In the meantime, Garver is trying to get back together with his former girlfriend Tobie played by a young Donna Mills.  Evelyn trashes Garver's house and almost kills his housekeeper, Birdie (Clarice Taylor) and is taken away by the police and put into an asylum.  Garver thinks it's over, but Evelyn gets out of the asylum and there is one last chilling scene involving scissors and a knife.  Mr. Eastwood uses the natural beauty of the Monterey Peninsula to great effect in the film, with wide shots of the rolling surf and picturesque sunsets.  There is one odd montage in the middle of the film which is like a music video set to Roberta Flack's ""The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face"", in which Tobie & Garver roam through the landscape and end up in a secluded pond.  The use of the two year old song in the film actually propelled it to number one on the charts and made a star out of the relatively unknown Ms. Flack.  There is also a scene from the Monterey Jazz Festival with actual performances by Johnny Otis and Cannonball Adderley.  The actors all give credible performances.

When it was released in theaters in 1971 it was a top grossing film of that year and raked in some box office bucks. Clint for certain probably liked doing this movie because not only does it take place in his own place of residence, Carmel, Ca., but he also had the chance to play a Jazz radio DJ in it. Clint has been a long time fan of Jazz music, and this character he plays, Dave Garvin, is probably the hippest character Eastwood ever played. In one scene a co-worker even offers him a few hits off a joint which he calmly refuses. Jessica Walter plays a big fan of Dave's radio show and worms her way into his life and burrows in deep. At first she seems like a pretty great gal, but before long she begins to exhibit some rather bizzare behavior and Dave can't seem to get rid of her. She becomes more and more mentally unstable and targets him and his friends for revenge when she realizes he no longer wants to date her. Jessica Walter turns in a great performance as the central female psycho who loses him and then eventually stalks him. It was nice to see Eastwood's friend Don Siegal in the role of a local bartender. Siegal directed several films Eastwood appeared in, most note worthy of these films was Dirty Harry. This entire movie is filled with gorgeous shots of Carmel and it's surrounding terrain. Eastwood's acting in this movie is really very good as well.

199239,A1J2931UBBJPXM,6300181405,Reviewer,"[22, 23]","Clint Eastwood made his directorial debut with this 1971 suspense/thriller, ""Play Misty for Me,"" in which he also stars as Dave Garver, a late night radio disc jockey for a small station in Carmel, California.  During his show, he opens the phones to take requests, at which times a frequent caller-- a woman named Evelyn (Jessica Walter)-- always asks for the same tune, ""Misty.""  Her obsession, it turns out, is not with that particular record, but with Garver, who is currently sorting out a relationship gone bad with a young artist, Tobie (Donna Mills), but which may be on the mend in light of the fact that Tobie has just returned to town after a lengthy absence in the wake of their breakup.  In the interim, Garver has become entangled with Evelyn, a fan he soon discovers gives new meaning to the term ""fanatic.""Eastwood invades Hitchcock territory with this film, which it turns out was indeed a harbinger of the course his career would take from this point on, that of directing and starring in his own movies.  With this one, it's apparent that he had that special touch from the beginning; he knows unequivocally what he likes, what works and how to deliver it.  The only weakness in the film (if you can even call it a weakness), would be the use of longshots during a couple of scenes between Garver and Tobie that take place on the coast.  It adds a scenic vista for a backdrop, but listening to the dialogue with the actors in the distance gives it a dialogue-added-later feeling.  It's a minor flaw, however, that takes nothing away from the overall impact of the film, especially as Eastwood establishes a deliberate pace that allows the tension to mount throughout.It would seem that for an actor to direct himself would be a monumental undertaking, especially the first time, but Eastwood proves here what has been corroborated over the years and with his films since, that he is his own best director.  And it's a club to which few actor/directors belong, which puts him in the elite company of Welles, Branagh and most recently, Ed Harris (with ""Pollock""), just to name a few of the select.  As Garver, a minor celebrity whose biggest fan turns out to be his worst nightmare, Eastwood is thoroughly convincing, and though this may not be one of his most memorable roles, it is certainly well acted, and delivered with that subtle Eastwood charm.Jessica Walter combines just the right amount of beauty, charm and menace for her role of Evelyn, which just may be her most memorable performance ever.  She creates a character who is smoothly confident, if slightly vulnerable, and prone to instantaneous bursts of psychotic anger.  It's an honest portrait of an extremely disturbed individual with the ability to conceal the true nature-- and danger-- of her mental state.  Exceptionally well realized by Walter, Evelyn could be the older sister of Stephen King's Annie in ""Misery,"" a role for which Kathy Bates received an Oscar for Best Actress some twenty years after Walter inhabited the body of Evelyn.The supporting cast includes John Larch (Sergeant McCallum), Jack Ging (Frank), Irene Hervey (Madge), James McEachin (Al Monte), Clarice Taylor (Birdie) and Don Siegel (Murphy).  A film that will have you on the edge of your seat by the end, ""Play Misty for Me"" withstands the test of time and works every bit as well today as when it was originally released.  A tale from the dark side, it's engrossing entertainment that may give you second thoughts about that casual acquaintance you've just invited to your house for dinner.  Eastwood chose a perfect setting for his film, using one of the most beautiful spots along the California coast as a background against which to contrast the grisly events of the story.

We soon learn that he has had an uncertain relationship with Tobie (Donna Mills) to whom he is reluctant to make a commitment because he enjoys his independence. At one point, he becomes involved with one of his frequent callers, Evelyn (Jessica Walter). She is  an attractive but smothering woman who requires a full-time commitment after a casual sexual encounter, as in Fatal Attraction. Garver refuses, becoming progressively more irritated with Evelyn's persistence. That is probably one of the reasons why he considers a reconciliation, perhaps even a semi-permanent relationship with Tobie as he also explores career opportunities in a much larger radio market. By now, the obviously psychotic Evelyn pesters him with several calls each day. In fact, she stalks him, desperately afraid to &quot;lose"" what she never really had in the first place. When Evelyn finally realizes what her situation is....Not a great film, Play Misty for Me is nonetheless a carefully crafted and entertaining drama which offers a number of memorable scenes within the ""cool"" life of a bachelor DJ in one of the loveliest areas in the entire United States. The performances by Eastwood and Walter are first-rate, as are those of John Larch (Sergeant McCallum) and Clarice Taylor (Birdie) in supporting roles. The plot is plausible and relatively straightforward. As directed by Eastwood, the moments of terror are especially effective.

The movie kept me on the edge of my seat, and despite (or maybe because of) the hysterical performance of Jessica Walter as the woman scorned, it did manage to create and sustain a mood of suspense.One thing: what the heck were the two montage sequences doing in the film? They were so out of place and really detracted from the atmosphere. The movie could've really done without them, although I didn't mind seeing a nekkid Clint Estwood pawing away at a nekkid Donna Mills in a forest while Roberta Flack sings in the background.Classic scene: psycho-woman Jessica Walter gets into one of many fights with Eastwood's character and screams at him ""You're nothing!

I wanted to see this for a long time because, for some reason, I never watched it the million of times that it played on late night TV. The story is well known: Eastwood plays Dave, a DJ who's trying to make the big leagues (he's a lousy DJ, his banter is really only announcing the song titles between tracks) who has a fling with a woman who turned out to be a psychotic stalker Evelyn who kept him guessing all movie long. Meanwhile, an old flame re-enters Dave's life and he wants to give her his attention. Meanwhile, there are attempted murders, murders, Dave's place is trashed, Evelyn goes to the looney bin after nearly killing Dave's maid, spouting insane ""I love you/I hate you"" jibberish ""You're not even good in bed. I just felt sorry for you"" before begging for forgiveness; when she is released after only a week in care (?!?!?!), the action picks up for its predictable finale.There's some pretty bad dialogue in the film, such as one exchange between Dave and a guy who seems pretty gay:- Why don't you go cruise some sailors?- Please - don't mention seafood.Then there's the faux-antagonistic dialogue between Eastwood and a cop who's on hand to deal with deranged Evelyn:- You make lousy conversation.- You make lousy coffee.Then there are some other great lines, like ""I can think of a thouand reasons why we should begin again,"" and ""four months in Sasolito is a long time.""Dave finally plays the song ""Misty"", a mere 38 minutes into the film, and also in an ironic bit at the end of the movie. There's a long 11-minute sequence that shows Dave and his girlfriend making love in a waterfall (?!?!), followed by a long sequence at the Monterey Jazz Festival.

Walter's plays a deranged woman who sleeps with Eastwood one night, and in her mind forges a love affair. After being rejected by the Eastwood character, we see Walter's portrayal of a clear psychotic that should have garnered her an Oscar nomination. What makes matter's worse is when Donna Mills enters the picture as Eastwood's girlfriend, standing in the way of the killer's revenge. The plot moves by fast and there are some amazing surprises. I was really shocked how good this film is, as I am not really a movie fan of early '70's cinema. ""Play Misty For Me"" also served as the springboard for the 1987 film ""Fatal Attraction"", starring Michael Douglas and Glenn Close, and I have often wondered if Close watched Walter's role in this movie; both are virtuoso perfromances, and in the hands of inexperienced actresses, both roles would have fallen to the wayside.This DVD also contains a great documentary, featuring interviews with Eastwood, Walters and Mills, who discusses how she quit her daytime serial, ""Love is a Many Splendored Thing"", on a Friday, and by Monday morning, was on the ""Misty"" set working with Eastwood. Without a doubt a 5 star film.

However, that said, it could have been a lot better.  It's great to see Clint in street clothes, but his direction seems tentative (too slow) at times, at others, muddled.  Though the Monterey Jazz scene is one I like, it's dilutes the power the movie has built up to this point.  I would have liked to have seen Clint include this scene in a way that adds to the flow rather than detracts from it.  The love scene is in there to allow the entire Roberta Flack sung 'The First Time I Ever Saw Your Face' to be included without edit.  This was a mistake.  I love that song, but this scene is just gratuitous filmmaking, pure and simple.  Besides, Donna Mills isn't that pretty, then or now.  Plus her acting (at least in this movie) is weak, probably the only person in the movie who looks unsure of herself and her role.  As far as Clint's acting, well...  In one way, I want to say that he just phoned this in.  On the other hand, I enjoyed his laidback performance.  But, as critics once upon a time said, is it acting?  I'm not so sure.  For me, Clint's best movie, and best acting, is/was 'Thunderbolt and Lightfoot' (1974).  This movie is much better than 'Play Misty for Me'.  The characters are much more memorable, and the script, by Michael Cimino (who also directed) is first rate.  If you liked Clint in this, see 'Thunderbolt and Lightfoot'.  It's not only the best Clint movie you've never seen, it's THE BEST MOVIE you've never seen.  'Play Misty for Me' is most notable for Jessica Walter's performance.  She is SCARY in this movie.  Her performance is the best reason to see this movie.  Without her presence, this movie would not have worked.  She should have become a star after this movie.

199262,A2Q457CES5ZUZ,6300181405,William Hare,"[2, 2]","&quot;Play Misty for Me&quot; was Clint Eastwood's debut film as a director.  He shrewdly had old friend and colleague, veteran director Don Siegel, who directed him in his box office winner &quot;Dirty Harry,&quot; along as a potential backup if needed, giving him a role as bartender of the haunt the actor frequents as male lead in the film.  Eastwood's idea to film &quot;Misty&quot; in his hometown, scenic Carmel in Northern California's Monterey Peninsula, was an excellent choice.  It gave cinematographer Bruce Surtees an opportunity to take advantage of the visual beauty of the area, which he does with abundance, making the film a scenic pleasure to watch.  Eastwood, a noted jazz lover, also shrewdly takes advantage of filming opportunities at the annual Monterey Jazz Festival.  Playing a disc jockey in the film, we see time frames based on the number of days to the upcoming festival, which Eastwood plugs frequently.  Lots of excellent firsthand shots of the festival are seen, while certain artists are observed showcasing their musical talents.As for the plot, the story line is credible, sharply on point.  Eastwood meets Jessica Walters one night at Siegel's bar after he has finished doing his show.  He walks her home, learning she is the faithful fan who keeps requesting the Errol Garner classic, &quot;Misty.&quot;  When she makes herself available, he hesitates, revealing he is hung up on someone, namely Donna Mills, then away pursuing her art career in Sausalito.  Walters responds that there is nothing wrong with them making love with no attachments, after which Eastwood agrees to what he wrongly believes is a one night stand.Eastwood is ultimately smothered by the persistent and mentally disturbed Walters, who surprises him by showing up unannounced at his home shortly after their sexual escapade with a bag of groceries in her arms, declaring her intention of fixing him dinner.  He tries repeatedly and vainly to shake her, his romance with Mills being jeopardized in the process.  He even loses an opportunity to develop a musical program concept for an interested producer, Irene Hervey, after Walters, wrongly believing she has interrupted a date, launches a savage verbal assault on the other woman when she finds them lunching at a local restaurant.  Eventually a frenzied Walters attacks and hospitalizes Eastwood's cleaning lady, Clarice Taylor, with a knife, after which both are hospitalized, in Walters' case being involuntarily confined for her mental problems.Just when Eastwood believes he is rid of Walters for good he receives a call from her.  She reveals she is at San Francisco Airport awaiting boarding of a flight that will take her to Honolulu, where a job awaits her following her release from the mental facility.  Eastwood declares there are no hard feelings on his part, asks how she is feeling, and wishes her well.As he goes back to playing records, agreeing to play Walter's last request, her favorite tune, &quot;Misty,&quot; Eastwood begins reflecting on the lines from the poem Walters recited for him before ending their call.  It was from Edgar Allen Poe's &quot;Annabel Lee.&quot;  Mills has told him that her new roommate is named Annabel.  When he calls Mills the phone is answered by Walters, who has tied up Eastwood's girlfriend.  She tells Eastwood she is waiting for him.  Eastwood puts on an old tape and leaves the studio for Mills' Carmel Highlands residence and a fatal showdown with Walters, who intends to kill them both in her fitful rage.This brutally realistic film paved the way for later movies displaying stark sexual realism such as Michael Douglas' two triumphs, &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot; and &quot;Basic Instinct.&quot;  My only qualm is that the violence could have been toned down in the case of the knife attack on Clarice Taylor without losing any drama or story impact.  All in all, however, this is a gem combining a strong story that moves briskly with the dramatically beautiful scenery of one of the world's most captivating areas.",4,A One Night Stand Gone Wrong,1010188800,"01 5, 2002",2002,4040,"['quot', 'Play', 'Misty', 'Me', 'quot', 'was', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'debut', 'film', 'director', 'shrewdly', 'had', 'old', 'friend', 'colleague', 'veteran', 'director', 'Don', 'Siegel', 'who', 'directed', 'box', 'office', 'winner', 'quot', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'quot', 'along', 'potential', 'backup', 'needed', 'giving', 'role', 'bartender', 'haunt', 'actor', 'frequents', 'male', 'lead', 'film', 'Eastwood', 'idea', 'film', 'quot', 'Misty', 'quot', 'hometown', 'scenic', 'Carmel', 'Northern', 'California', 'Monterey', 'Peninsula', 'was', 'excellent', 'choice', 'gave', 'cinematographer', 'Bruce', 'Surtees', 'opportunity', 'take', 'advantage', 'visual', 'beauty', 'area', 'abundance', 'making', 'film', 'scenic', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'Eastwood', 'noted', 'jazz', 'lover', 'also', 'shrewdly', 'advantage', 'filming', 'opportunities', 'annual', 'Monterey', 'Jazz', 'Festival', 'Playing', 'disc', 'jockey', 'film', 'see', 'time', 'frames', 'based', 'number', 'days', 'upcoming', 'festival', 'Eastwood', 'plugs', 'frequently', 'Lots', 'excellent', 'firsthand', 'shots', 'festival', 'are', 'seen', 'certain', 'artists', 'are', 'observed', 'showcasing', 'musical', 'talents.As', 'plot', 'story', 'line', 'credible', 'sharply', 'point', 'Eastwood', 'meets', 'Jessica', 'Walters', 'one', 'night', 'Siegel', 'bar', 'finished', 'doing', 'show', 'home', 'learning', 'faithful', 'fan', 'who', 'requesting', 'Errol', 'Garner', 'classic', 'quot', 'Misty.', 'quot', 'When', 'available', 'revealing', 'hung', 'up', 'someone', 'namely', 'Donna', 'Mills', 'then', 'away', 'pursuing', 'art', 'career', 'Sausalito', 'Walters', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'making', 'love', 'attachments', 'Eastwood', 'what', 'wrongly', 'one', 'night', 'stand.Eastwood', 'ultimately', 'smothered', 'persistent', 'mentally', 'disturbed', 'Walters', 'who', 'showing', 'up', 'unannounced', 'home', 'shortly', 'sexual', 'escapade', 'bag', 'groceries', 'arms', 'declaring', 'intention', 'fixing', 'dinner', 'repeatedly', 'vainly', 'shake', 'romance', 'Mills', 'being', 'jeopardized', 'process', 'even', 'opportunity', 'develop', 'musical', 'program', 'concept', 'interested', 'producer', 'Irene', 'Hervey', 'Walters', 'wrongly', 'believing', 'interrupted', 'date', 'savage', 'verbal', 'assault', 'other', 'woman', 'when', 'lunching', 'local', 'restaurant', 'Eventually', 'frenzied', 'Walters', 'attacks', 'Eastwood', 'cleaning', 'lady', 'Clarice', 'Taylor', 'knife', 'are', 'hospitalized', 'Walters', 'case', 'being', 'involuntarily', 'confined', 'mental', 'problems.Just', 'when', 'Eastwood', 'rid', 'Walters', 'good', 'call', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Airport', 'awaiting', 'boarding', 'flight', 'will', 'take', 'Honolulu', 'where', 'job', 'following', 'release', 'mental', 'facility', 'Eastwood', 'are', 'hard', 'feelings', 'part', 'how', 'feeling', 'well.As', 'back', 'playing', 'records', 'agreeing', 'play', 'Walter', 'last', 'request', 'favorite', 'tune', 'quot', 'Misty', 'quot', 'Eastwood', 'reflecting', 'lines', 'poem', 'Walters', 'recited', 'ending', 'call', 'was', 'Edgar', 'Allen', 'Poe', 'quot', 'Annabel', 'Lee.', 'quot', 'Mills', 'told', 'new', 'roommate', 'named', 'Annabel', 'When', 'phone', 'answered', 'Walters', 'who', 'tied', 'up', 'Eastwood', 'girlfriend', 'Eastwood', 'waiting', 'Eastwood', 'old', 'tape', 'studio', 'Mills', 'Carmel', 'Highlands', 'residence', 'fatal', 'showdown', 'Walters', 'who', 'kill', 'fitful', 'rage.This', 'brutally', 'realistic', 'film', 'paved', 'way', 'later', 'movies', 'displaying', 'stark', 'sexual', 'realism', 'such', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'two', 'triumphs', 'quot', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'quot', 'quot', 'Basic', 'Instinct.', 'quot', 'My', 'only', 'violence', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'toned', 'down', 'case', 'knife', 'attack', 'Clarice', 'Taylor', 'losing', 'drama', 'story', 'impact', 'however', 'gem', 'combining', 'strong', 'story', 'briskly', 'dramatically', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'one', 'world', 'most', 'captivating', 'areas']",N/A

199264,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,6300181405,Wuchak,"[6, 6]","1971's ""Play Misty for Me"" was Clint Eastwood's debut as a director. The story features Clint as a DJ in Carmel, the scenic coastal town south of San Francisco. He has what he thinks is a casual fling with one of his devoted listeners (Jessica Walter). When Eastwood starts to see how clingy and wacko the woman is he tries to end it, but she is determined to have a relationship. Things get crazier and bloodier from there. Donna Mills co-stars as Clint's other (real) girlfriend.""Play Misty for me"" is the obvious precursor to the more popular later film ""Fatal Attraction"" (1987), but I haven't seen ""Fatal"" for so long I can't compare the two.The story and acting are completely realistic, which I find refreshing, as well as engaging. One of the highlights is definitely the gorgeous Carmel coastal locations.Personally, I don't find Jessica Walter very attractive so I can't relate to Eastwood's interest in her in the story, but -- then again -- maybe that's why he just wanted to ""use her and lose her."" Also, I feel he should have caught on a bit quicker that she was too clingy and looney -- I would have.Lastly, I realize that Clint's attitude toward women and sex in the story simply reflects the zeitgeist of that era, but doesn't he share at least some of the blame for the problems that ensue? In the film Clint's character views sex as a mere physical encounter and Misty as a throwaway object in which he can satisfy his lust and pride. On the contrary, Misty is a real person who understandably sees their sexual union as something deeper. Something not just physical, but emotional and spiritual as well. Is it any wonder that she starts to increasingly lose it after Eastwood breaks off the relationship? Not that I'm justifying her actions.I'm not preachin' to anyone here, anymore than the film itself. I'm just pointing out how ""Play Misty for Me"" potently illustrates the possible consequences of treating people like throwaway sex objects. In the vast majority of cases, of course, the consequences aren't nearly as extreme, but there are always repercussions, even if it's just a broken or hardened heart. Try as we might, separating the physical from the spiritual is a lost cause.""Play Misty for Me"" is a deceptively quiet film that slowly builds momentum to the emotionally explosive climax. It probably won't blow you away or anything, but it gave me everything I could possibly want in this type of film.
