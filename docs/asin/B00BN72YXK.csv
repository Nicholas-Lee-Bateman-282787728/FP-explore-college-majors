The plot is a bit sketchy, something to do with bio-technology and medicine.  How they got dinosaurs from that is anyone's guess, apparently the loopy CEO (Ronny Cox) thought they were contained/tamed/a novelty for sporting events, maybe even pets!  They thought it would be cool to regenerate ""meat eaters"" first.  What could go wrong?  Enter a dopey dad (Treat Williams) who thought his daughter would like to attend the dinosaurs coming out party.  What could go wrong?  They had over 100 dinosaurs to be distributed (party favors?).  The trouble starts when Larry breaks out.  (Isn't that cute, they named them.)  What follows is a lot of atrocious dialog, general all-purpose mayhem, chomping, stomping.......  The movie fares best when it doesn't feature any of the characters.  When the dinosaurs stampede it's sublime.  When the cast try to `act' it's almost painful to watch.  They either try too hard or not hard enough, the worst of the lot being Jullian Rose Reed (playing the daughter with a watered down version of an ""attitude"").Everything about this movie feels as though they made it up on the spot; no rehearsals, no second thoughts.  There are a lot of elements that are just lame.This was a crap shoot but I liked it for that and the unapologetic way in which they presented it.  (I'm sure Ronny Cox and Treat Williams were happy to take the money and run.  What does desperation pay these days?)Fortunately, I have a special place for movies like this in my collection.

1636131,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00BN72YXK,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","3 1/2 Stars: On The Bad Movie SyFy Scale1 1/2 Stars: If You're Looking For A Real MovieNo one can say that the film production company called The Asylum aren't consistent. The premiere brand in spectacularly bad entertainment, The Asylum works in conjunction with the SyFy Channel to fill its slate of original movie productions. From a technical standpoint, these movies don't boast high production values or A-list actors. Instead, they aspire to a silliness that can either be refreshingly entertaining or just plain excruciating. The movies are bad, to be sure, but some can rise to the level of Bad Movie Magic. For my money, ""Age of Dinosaurs"" is so terrifically awful that it kept me fitfully amused throughout its brief running time. In my estimation, the moderate success of this treat is a fully committed cast, a tongue-in-cheek sense of humor, and a escalating sense of over-the-top mayhem. If you're a fan of bad movie cheese, this is a nice appetizer. If, however, this is not your particular genre interest--you will truly detest this picture with every fiber of your being. On the SyFy movie scale, this is a solid 3 1/2 stars for its inspired lunacy. On any other scale, it would be considerably less!Part of my enthusiasm for ""Age of Dinosaurs"" is that it is really several different movies and each works well enough on its own. At the beginning, we meet our hero (Treat Williams) and his annoying daughter (Awkward's Jillian Rose Reed). First let me say that I'm a fan of Williams. Emerging as a major actor in the early eighties with stellar performances in ""Hair"" and ""Prince of the City,"" he has lately been a solid TV presence with great work like ""Everwood."" Sadly, this is not exactly a great step for him! That said, he does lend this fluff more gravitas than you might expect. Anyway, Williams attends a gala celebration of wealthy philanthropist Ronnie Cox. A revolutionary bio-tech invention has the ability to regenerate the flesh. Beyond the medical implications, these new advances have led to the rebirth of the dinosaur. Channeling the bluster of the speeches within ""Jurassic Park,"" the beasts are unveiled to the crowd. As you might expect, things go awry and they are soon on the loose.I loved the initial set-up of ""Age of Dinosaurs"" and when everyone is trapped in the building with them. I couldn't help feeling that it felt like ""Die Hard"" except with dinosaurs instead of terrorists! And that's pretty fun. Shortly, however, they are ripping across the streets of Los Angeles on some relentless mission (or so it would seem) to devour Rose Reed. I don't know why she was such a draw, though, I bet she tastes bitter. Anyway, the cheesy effects ramp up with helicopters, armed squads, dinosaurs smashing into buildings. The lunacy is relatively non-stop and its oftentimes laugh-out-loud funny, particularly the junky CGI. Everyone involved in ""Age of Dinosaurs"" knew they were making a terrible movie, and they reveled in this fact. It's a lark, but also instantly forgettable--junk food for the brain. While I'd say to check it out for free on SyFy, I'm not entirely sure it merits a DVD purchase. Brain dead fun, though.

1636133,A2T7TZBOTP68C7,B00BN72YXK,"L. Mintah ""Author of the Heart""","[2, 4]","Age of Dinosaurs was better than Jurassic Park in several ways.  First, the dinosaurs were introduced sooner.  Second, there were no romantic dynamics taking away from dino screen time.  Third, there was a lot more types of dinosaurs and they wreaked more havoc that did the ones in the Jurassic Park series.  Do you remember the one time we saw a Triceratops in Jurassic Park, it was dying?The acting was excellent.  Treat Williams plays, Gabe, a widowed fireman who takes his teenage daughter Jade to see something very cool, but ends up trying to save Jade from escaped dinos.  Jade is a piece of work.  Bratty, rude, disrespectful of her father, she leaves in the middle of the event and goes to text her boyfriend.  Dad is calling - oh, just hit 'ignore.'  The most compelling and complex character is Justin Juarisco (Ronny Cox).  He is the head of Geneti-Sharp.  His company is known for their flesh-rengenerating products that heal burn patients completely.  Justin has also secretly used his companies expertise to rebuild dinosaurs of every kind with just a single DNA sample.  Justin is not greedy.  He genuinely wants to help people.  He has absolute faith in the scientists who work for him to keep the public safe.  That was his mistake.  Through the ovie he is urged to flee in a Geneti-Sharp private helicopter  But he refuses to leave when people are dying  He feels tremendous guilt and shame.The special effects, especially the dinosaurs, were excellent.

But it is a true shlock film,  Shlock films are awkward and  often hilarious in their earnest badness. They don't realize how bad they are! Truly bad dialog and situations that are silly make for  a fun night of true shlockness and laughs.  Ok, bad films aren't always shlock though.  This is though. Why?  IT has to be seen to be believed actually. For instance dinosaurs run across town chasing one car and then all run to the same building where are hero and his daughter are.  Treat Williams overacts in this one and has to deal with a modern daughter who can't get out of her phone. This is without a doubt a major problem for some people , and she's also rude. lol. The dialog in this one is unbelievable and clunky! true shlock, not bad filmmaking but shiocking!  The shlock scenes are too many to count in this one. I can't explain it, this is one to see and just wallow in it's dumbness, ""We made dinosaurs for your birthday party!' yes giant dinosaurs will be on lease for you to have in parades.
