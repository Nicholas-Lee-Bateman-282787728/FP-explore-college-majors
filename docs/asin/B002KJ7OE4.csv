And, the individually released introduction DVD ""The M.A.S.S. Device"" has three figher jets with the red white and blue jetstreams as the picture disc, so they're all quite different. Also, interesting to point out, there's an empty tray slot, an ""18th"" disc spot for the 1987 GI JOE movie that does not come with the set, hopefully it's released at a later date.

The toys were awesome and you knew your buddies had some so you would get together and play for hours with Duke, Snake Eyes, Flint, Scralett and so on. Bazooka and Rock & Roll were two of my favorites. The shows had the same plot. Cobra would come up with a scheme and G I Joe would kick their butts. Good vs evil and the good guys would win. G I Joe The Movie 1987 was a jewel in the crown of achievements. It ended the series well and left you knowing the world was safe once again.

1274899,ATJLR5VAS2QE5,B002KJ7OE4,Garrett Aja,"[39, 62]","While no where near as flawed as their Transformers DVDs, Rhino's DVDs of G.I. Joe were not without their problems. Incorrect intros, uncorrected footage, unwarranted digital ""corrections"", and even censorship appeared on the four sets Rhino released before loosing the Sunbow license. When Shout! Factory announced their complete sets for both shows, the hope was that G.I. Joe would arrive on DVD complete and as broadcast. Unfortunately, this isn't the case. For the most part, the episodes that were released by Rhino earlier this decade are the same on this set as they were on the Rhino releases (though the intros have fixed for the first half of Season 1, thankfully).What this means is that, among others, the following errors return:-Two Timbers near the beginning of the fourth part of The MASS Device, ""Duel in the Devil's Cauldron""-The wrong text on Cobra Commander's card about the Fatal Fluffies in Part 1 of The Pyramid of Darkness-A dizzying number of missed re-takes in the second part of The Pyramid of Darkness, but a digital edit to ""fix"" a shot where some of the USS Flagg's sailors ""blink"" on and offscreen (even though this error was not fixed in the aired episode)-Some shots of Lt. Claymore in ""The Traitor"" Part 2 where the African-American Cobra is colored as a caucasian male-The censorship of ""There's No Place Like Springfield"" Part 2 when Althaea points a bazooka at Shipwreck and calls him a ""drip""-Images of (very crudely illustrated) nude women that were cropped out of ""Glamour Girls"" before airingAnd the following errors are introduced (again, this isn't a complete list):-The final part of The MASS Device miniseries featured a slightly longer version of the MASS end credits when it aired. While the audio appears intact here, the credits are of the normal, shorter version. The video is not slowed down, so you get black space for the last 8 seconds or so of the theme.-Only two of the writers of ""Grey Hairs and Growing Pains"" receive credit for their work.-Duke appears as a background character during the final act of ""The Most Dangerous Thing in the World"" when he was systematically (and, truth be told, creatively) removed from the episode before airing so as to not create a massive plot hole-In ""In the Presence of Mine Enemies"" a shot of Raven (the Native American Strato-Viper featured in the episode) features a digital edit to ""correct"" an instance where she was given the skin color of a caucasian (while leaving alone a couple of long shots).-In ""Into Your Tent I Will Silently Creep"", Cross County's line, "".....but I know there's a bunch of music critics!"" is excised from the cafeteria scene. This edit was shown off in Rhino's Season 2, Part 1 set in the Special Features section.The special features are equally lacking. First and foremost, seven of the infamous PSAs are not present on this set. Secondly, the presence of Larry Hama in many of the features (including one focused on him) seems a bit excessive, especially since Hama had minimal interaction with the Sunbow writing staff (and, according to an online interview with Buzz Dixon, who was not interviewed for this set, there was some antipathy between the Joe writers and Hama). Also annoying is how the comics included on the dog-tag memory stick play off the Snake Eyes vs. Storm Shadow conflict that appeared only in the comics-the cartoon featured Storm Shadow in an ongoing battle with SPIRIT. However, these annoyances are partially offset by the sublime cast reunion and the large number of toy commercials (the comic commercials, like all direct references to Marvel Comics, have been omitted from this set).However, it is the meat of this DVD set, the episodes, where it ultimately fails. In using the 35mm negatives on these Sunbow sets, Hasbro and their home video partners have opened a Pandora's Box of problems. Sure, the footage culled from the negatives looks great (even though Rhino's telecine transfers were decidedly subpar), but let's face facts: G.I. Joe, The Transformers, and all the other Sunbow shows were edited on video. While this would not normally be an unsurpassable hurdle, the film elements for the re-takes have not shown themselves, and may be lost. Therefore, it's prudent to concentrate on cleaning up and preserving the 1"" broadcast masters. Sure, this will not address the censorship issues (all three of them), but it will eliminate the bulk of the problems with this DVD set.",2,A flawed set which corrects few of the issues with Rhino's DVDs,1254700800,"10 5, 2009",2009,4441,"['where', 'near', 'as', 'flawed', 'Transformers', 'DVDs', 'Rhino', 'DVDs', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'were', 'not', 'problems', 'Incorrect', 'intros', 'uncorrected', 'footage', 'unwarranted', 'digital', 'corrections', 'even', 'censorship', 'appeared', 'four', 'sets', 'Rhino', 'released', 'loosing', 'Sunbow', 'license', 'When', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'announced', 'complete', 'sets', 'shows', 'hope', 'was', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'would', 'arrive', 'DVD', 'complete', 'broadcast', 'Unfortunately', ""n't"", 'case', 'most', 'part', 'episodes', 'were', 'released', 'Rhino', 'earlier', 'decade', 'are', 'same', 'set', 'were', 'Rhino', 'releases', 'intros', 'have', 'fixed', 'first', 'half', 'Season', '1', 'thankfully', 'others', 'following', 'errors', 'return', '-Two', 'Timbers', 'beginning', 'fourth', 'part', 'MASS', 'Device', 'Duel', 'Devil', 'Cauldron', '-The', 'wrong', 'text', 'Cobra', 'Commander', 'card', 'Fatal', 'Fluffies', 'Part', '1', 'Pyramid', 'Darkness-A', 'dizzying', 'number', 'missed', 're-takes', 'second', 'part', 'Pyramid', 'Darkness', 'digital', 'edit', 'fix', 'shot', 'where', 'USS', 'Flagg', 'sailors', 'blink', 'offscreen', 'even', 'error', 'was', 'not', 'fixed', 'aired', 'episode', '-Some', 'shots', 'Lt.', 'Claymore', 'Traitor', 'Part', '2', 'where', 'African-American', 'Cobra', 'colored', 'caucasian', 'male-The', 'censorship', 'Place', 'Springfield', 'Part', '2', 'when', 'Althaea', 'bazooka', 'Shipwreck', 'drip', '-Images', 'very', 'crudely', 'illustrated', 'nude', 'women', 'were', 'cropped', 'Glamour', 'Girls', 'following', 'errors', 'are', 'introduced', 'again', ""n't"", 'complete', 'list', '-The', 'final', 'part', 'MASS', 'Device', 'miniseries', 'featured', 'slightly', 'longer', 'version', 'MASS', 'end', 'credits', 'when', 'aired', 'audio', 'intact', 'here', 'credits', 'are', 'normal', 'shorter', 'version', 'video', 'not', 'slowed', 'down', 'get', 'black', 'space', 'last', '8', 'seconds', 'so', 'theme.-Only', 'two', 'writers', 'Grey', 'Hairs', 'Growing', 'Pains', 'receive', 'credit', 'work.-Duke', 'background', 'character', 'final', 'act', 'Most', 'Dangerous', 'Thing', 'World', 'when', 'was', 'systematically', 'truth', 'be', 'told', 'creatively', 'removed', 'episode', 'airing', 'so', 'not', 'create', 'massive', 'plot', 'hole-In', 'Presence', 'Mine', 'Enemies', 'shot', 'Raven', 'Native', 'American', 'Strato-Viper', 'featured', 'episode', 'digital', 'edit', 'correct', 'instance', 'where', 'was', 'given', 'skin', 'color', 'caucasian', 'leaving', 'alone', 'couple', 'long', 'shots', '.-In', 'Into', 'Your', 'Tent', 'Will', 'Silently', 'Creep', 'Cross', 'County', 'line', '..but', 'know', 'bunch', 'music', 'critics', 'excised', 'cafeteria', 'scene', 'edit', 'was', 'shown', 'off', 'Rhino', 'Season', '2', 'Part', '1', 'set', 'Special', 'Features', 'section.The', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'equally', 'lacking', 'First', 'foremost', 'seven', 'infamous', 'PSAs', 'are', 'not', 'present', 'set', 'Secondly', 'presence', 'Larry', 'Hama', 'many', 'features', 'including', 'one', 'focused', 'bit', 'excessive', 'especially', 'Hama', 'had', 'minimal', 'interaction', 'Sunbow', 'writing', 'staff', 'according', 'online', 'interview', 'Buzz', 'Dixon', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'interviewed', 'set', 'was', 'antipathy', 'Joe', 'writers', 'Hama', 'Also', 'annoying', 'how', 'comics', 'included', 'dog-tag', 'memory', 'stick', 'play', 'Snake', 'Eyes', 'vs.', 'Storm', 'Shadow', 'conflict', 'appeared', 'only', 'comics-the', 'cartoon', 'featured', 'Storm', 'Shadow', 'ongoing', 'battle', 'SPIRIT', 'However', 'annoyances', 'are', 'partially', 'offset', 'sublime', 'cast', 'reunion', 'large', 'number', 'toy', 'commercials', 'comic', 'commercials', 'direct', 'references', 'Marvel', 'Comics', 'have', 'been', 'omitted', 'set', '.However', 'meat', 'DVD', 'set', 'episodes', 'where', 'ultimately', 'using', '35mm', 'negatives', 'Sunbow', 'sets', 'Hasbro', 'home', 'video', 'partners', 'have', 'opened', 'Pandora', 'Box', 'problems', 'Sure', 'footage', 'culled', 'negatives', 'great', 'even', 'Rhino', 'telecine', 'transfers', 'were', 'decidedly', 'subpar', 'let', 'face', 'facts', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'Transformers', 'other', 'Sunbow', 'shows', 'were', 'edited', 'video', 'would', 'not', 'normally', 'be', 'unsurpassable', 'hurdle', 'film', 'elements', 're-takes', 'have', 'not', 'shown', 'may', 'be', 'lost', 'Therefore', 'prudent', 'concentrate', 'cleaning', 'up', 'preserving', '1', 'broadcast', 'masters', 'Sure', 'will', 'not', 'address', 'censorship', 'issues', 'three', 'will', 'eliminate', 'bulk', 'problems', 'DVD', 'set']",N/A

1274905,AZP335D31XNA7,B002KJ7OE4,RetroMan,"[6, 8]","I too brought this set when it was an exclusive and I would have to agree with the other reviews that the episodes and bonuses are very nice and it's finally great to have all the episodes in one complete set. My gripe is that the packaging could have been a whole lot better for the over 145 dollar price tag. My green box started to get green faded marks only after a week and I had to hand laminate the box to keep it in good condition. Also the disc artwork is great but the booklets they come in are very flimsy. The covers are cardboard and I also had to hand laminate them myself to keep it sturdy and they look much better with that gloss feel. Shout Factory would have been better off making the dvd booklets inside vinyl or some other sturdy material so they don't age so fast. Also inside the booklets the trays that hold the dvds are thinly glued together and they some times seperate. And finally the collectible booklet is rather flimsy also, for the price I just expected the packaging to be top notch and that is the most disappointing thing, collector's items should be sturdy and well made. I felt if this set was 99 dollars to 115 dollars that would be more reasonable, but you do get a lot content wise and that's the saving grace.",4,Great except for one thing...,1258675200,"11 20, 2009",2009,1251,"['too', 'brought', 'set', 'when', 'was', 'exclusive', 'would', 'have', 'agree', 'other', 'reviews', 'episodes', 'bonuses', 'are', 'very', 'nice', 'finally', 'great', 'have', 'episodes', 'one', 'complete', 'set', 'gripe', 'packaging', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'whole', 'lot', 'better', '145', 'dollar', 'price', 'tag', 'green', 'box', 'started', 'get', 'green', 'faded', 'marks', 'only', 'week', 'had', 'hand', 'laminate', 'box', 'keep', 'good', 'condition', 'Also', 'disc', 'artwork', 'great', 'booklets', 'come', 'are', 'very', 'flimsy', 'covers', 'are', 'cardboard', 'also', 'had', 'hand', 'laminate', 'keep', 'sturdy', 'look', 'much', 'better', 'gloss', 'feel', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'making', 'dvd', 'booklets', 'vinyl', 'other', 'sturdy', 'material', 'do', ""n't"", 'age', 'so', 'fast', 'Also', 'booklets', 'trays', 'hold', 'dvds', 'are', 'thinly', 'glued', 'together', 'times', 'seperate', 'finally', 'collectible', 'booklet', 'rather', 'flimsy', 'also', 'price', 'just', 'expected', 'packaging', 'be', 'top', 'notch', 'most', 'disappointing', 'thing', 'collector', 'items', 'should', 'be', 'sturdy', 'well', 'made', 'felt', 'set', 'was', '99', 'dollars', '115', 'dollars', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'reasonable', 'do', 'get', 'lot', 'content', 'wise', 'saving', 'grace']",N/A

Cumby,"[0, 4]","DISCLOSURE: While I am interested in purchasing this, and will more than likely do so, despite the flaws listed by others, I DO NOT currently own this at this time.Now that that's out of the way, let me get to why I am on here. I have seen two big, in-depth reviews of this product and they have been more helpful and insightful than anyone can imagine. In fact, it should be mine and everyone else's wish that more people write reviews like these so that others know just exactly what they are getting when they purchase said product.Yes, packaging is very important when making a big purchase. Would you buy this if it was made out of cardstock, or regular untreated cardboard, or manilla folders?And yes, the quality of print transfers definitely matter. If you are spending the time to make something this big, do it right. Although, I am a fan of tv to dvds being made as they aired, political incorrectness, flaws and all. Does something as trivial as two seconds of credits really matter, as someone asked? YES! In terms of music and video, especially animation, two seconds is a lot. I have refused to buy official LP to CD releases because of such known omissions. And I would do the same for dvds. And censorship? You betcha! Why can't things be released as they were made, language, images, and all. Popeye The Sailor, Vol. One has disclaimers, so should Johnny Quest (1964) (Hint, hint!)And for the people that get on here and make rude comments about said reviewers, take a long look at yourself before coming on here to try to insult people who write heartfelt reviews of products. Without them we would be a nation of pansies, too scared to buy anything or we would have a s-ton of less than stellar products clogging up our houses.",5,Please Read Before Posting Replies To Reviews,1267488000,"03 2, 2010",2010,1747,"['DISCLOSURE', 'am', 'interested', 'purchasing', 'will', 'more', 'likely', 'do', 'so', 'flaws', 'listed', 'others', 'DO', 'NOT', 'currently', 'own', 'time.Now', 'way', 'let', 'get', 'why', 'am', 'here', 'have', 'seen', 'two', 'big', 'in-depth', 'reviews', 'product', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'helpful', 'insightful', 'anyone', 'can', 'imagine', 'fact', 'should', 'be', 'mine', 'everyone', 'else', 'wish', 'more', 'people', 'write', 'reviews', 'others', 'know', 'just', 'exactly', 'what', 'are', 'getting', 'when', 'purchase', 'said', 'product.Yes', 'packaging', 'very', 'important', 'when', 'making', 'big', 'purchase', 'Would', 'buy', 'was', 'made', 'cardstock', 'regular', 'untreated', 'cardboard', 'manilla', 'folders', 'yes', 'quality', 'print', 'transfers', 'definitely', 'matter', 'are', 'spending', 'time', 'make', 'something', 'big', 'do', 'right', 'am', 'fan', 'tv', 'dvds', 'being', 'made', 'aired', 'political', 'incorrectness', 'flaws', 'Does', 'something', 'as', 'trivial', 'two', 'seconds', 'credits', 'really', 'matter', 'someone', 'asked', 'YES', 'terms', 'music', 'video', 'especially', 'animation', 'two', 'seconds', 'lot', 'have', 'refused', 'buy', 'official', 'LP', 'CD', 'releases', 'such', 'known', 'omissions', 'would', 'do', 'same', 'dvds', 'censorship', 'betcha', 'Why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'things', 'be', 'released', 'were', 'made', 'language', 'images', 'Popeye', 'Sailor', 'Vol', 'One', 'disclaimers', 'so', 'should', 'Johnny', 'Quest', '1964', 'Hint', 'hint', 'people', 'get', 'here', 'make', 'rude', 'comments', 'said', 'reviewers', 'take', 'long', 'look', 'coming', 'here', 'try', 'insult', 'people', 'who', 'write', 'heartfelt', 'reviews', 'products', 'would', 'be', 'nation', 'pansies', 'too', 'scared', 'buy', 'anything', 'would', 'have', 's-ton', 'less', 'stellar', 'products', 'clogging', 'up', 'houses']",N/A
