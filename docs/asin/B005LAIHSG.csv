I have no idea (Disney is all I know) but I can see vague similarities between this version and Disney, they're about as much alike as most book/movie adaptations.Don't show this one to small children- it's more violent with lots of sword fighting, arrow shooting and just a little blood. 9 drops of blood, 2 bloody mouths, 1 bloody forehead, 3 stabbings (1 of those bloodless) by my count. I found the first half to be slower  than the second with only a couple of battles but at least they looked impressive as did the big battle late in the movie.Some reviewers bash Kristen Stewart on just about every detail, I'd give her about as much credit here as I'd give Chris Hemsworth and he did pretty well most of the time. If I were to complain about anything I noticed while watching the extended version that when Snow White drops the poisoned apple if you watch closely she drops it twice!, needed a little bit better editing there.I've only watched the DVD, not the Blu ray, but the picture quality is great, depressing light/color for the more depressing parts of the story- the extended version is 4 minutes longer than the theatrical version, I'm not sure what got added.

Now coming to our key cast, I appreciated the slight scottish brogue that our hero had but felt it didn't add much and possibly it would have been better without. other than that he was a highlight although I prefered him as Thor. maybe its the cocky arrogance he pulled off so well yet still was like-able. Charlize Theron did well. She was possibly the only person fully invested in her role. and Kristin Stewart, well I can't help but feel the good reviews she has thus far gotten for this movie come from either her parent's friends, her staff, and the many twi-hards who dont hate her for ruining the fantasy about bella and edward out there. she played the same role she always plays with a less than believable vague british accent. this movie was trying to be to way too dark and too serious with a large budget focusing on a relatively untalented person.

The script, the scenery, the special effects, the costumes all worked together beautifully.  The special effects were especially amazing.I am not generally a Kirsten Stewart fan, but she was amazing in this film and I can't imagine anyone else for the the role. The Snow White character in this version has a strong quietness to her. Locked in the tower she is helpless till she sees birds flying near a large stake, and uses it escape when the Evil queens pervy brother comes to take her to the queen.Charlize Theron is extremely beautiful in this. Her character has a kind of Elizabeth Bathory style to her. As she drains the life young to give her power and magic. Charlize has a way of making you feel sorry for her. Her character has been hurt by love. She believes as society likes to believe, that a woman's power and usefulness is part of her being young and beautiful. When a women grows old and looses her beauty she is worthless and no longer needed. So to prevent this she does all she can. But the older she gets the more souls she needs.The unique thing is its the huntsman that is more important than the prince and he is the one that brings back Snow from her death. The prince, though does truly play his part in saving Snow, seems to take a backseat to the huntsman. I found myself rooting for the huntsman over the prince. But that is one aspect that they leave you hanging on. She doesn't really end up with either.The one thing I didn't like is that dwarves were not played by real little people.

In their decidedly serious take on the subject, Snow's father is murdered by her new stepmother (Charlize Theron), who promptly imprisons his daughter until she's able to break free and seek refuge in the dark forest. Needing her back, alive, Theron's Queen sends a washed-up huntsman (""Thor""'s Chris Hemsworth) after her, though he questions her motivations -- as well as his own -- after he runs into the young heroine.Happily eschewing the CGI'd green-screen approach of so many other, recent genre films, ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" benefits enormously from its real-world UK location shooting. The film looks like an actual, lived-in environment, and its ""realistic"" visuals are matched by equally strong performances, especially from Theron (in one of her juiciest roles) and Hemsworth, who does some nice work in a scene with the cursed Snow late in the film. For her part, Stewart does as much with the character of Snow White as the script allows - I bought her in Snow's empathetic scenes with the natural world, but she doesn't really have much to do in comparison with the other leads. There are also the dwarves, here played by a collection of character actors CGI'd to smaller proportions (Bob Hoskins, Ian McShane and Ray Winstone among them), but the film doesn't do nearly enough with that concept as it should have.The plot itself is surprisingly rich and traditional - not in terms of it being a fairy tale, but rather an old-fashioned cinematic fantasy-adventure - and is backed by impressive cinematography, costumes, and a satisfying mix of character and action. Sanders draws you in and lets the film breathe, and while there are CGI beasts, the film's emotional draw is human - rather than technical - in nature, and ends on a particularly satisfying beat (with a robust James Newton Howard score). Even more satisfying than the likes of ""Willow"" and ""Dragonslayer,"" this ""Snow White"" is a surprisingly good ""revisionist"" take of the oft-told tale on nearly every level.Universal brings ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" to Blu-Ray on September 11th in a combo pack featuring both the theatrical version and a slightly extended, 132-minute unrated cut. Extra features are fairly light - just a few making Of featurettes and commentary are on-hand - but the transfer (1080p AVC) is terrific, as is the DTS MA audio.

Spruell does his role with distinction, for a creep, that is.  Such a time-honor role on such a dishonorable character is not easy.  Spruell follow his character in the great tradition of past villains.  Such fine performance is lost in today's epic and period and fantasy films as Snow White and the Huntsman.  Charlize Theron, again, played it to the hilt as the evil queen.  Cruel, vicious, calculating and, worse, tenacious.  She does not give in so easily nor she suffers disappointments.  When her brother fails his task in dealing with Snow White (meaning, Snow White escapes), The Queen lashes out on him, reducing this season sadist into a sniveling little snot.

Snow White's story has been told and retold probably a hundred ways. This is a slightly different retelling all-around. I liked the new approach. To be honest, I've always found Snow White's basic story to be kind of boring. Great cast that keep the long movie evenly paced, great visual affects, and a fun and suspenseful angle. I thought Charlize was great as the villian, and thought Chris and Kristen were good also. Kristen appears to have a lot of haters or people who simply don't like her acting. I thought she was good here, although I didn't think the s/l asked that much of her from an emotional level. Prince Charming, or whoever the other guy was supposed to me, went missing for much of the way, paving the way for the Huntsmen. And it is the Huntsmen who does most of the heavy lifting here. Was expecting some kind of triangle, that thankfully never happened. This is Snow White's story though, and it was nice to see her go head-to-head with the Evil Witch. Found myself unsuspectingly rooting for her when the big battle finally arrived. Seemed too short, but I still enjoyed it. This film downplayed the usual romantic angle of Snow White, which I think worked for it. I wasn't really expecting to like this as much as I did.

This version displays the advances in CGI and loud noise between the dialogs forcing you to keep your finger on the volume control.In this story we see Ravenna (Charlize Theron) was deprived as a child. Her mother told her that you can have everything if you just maintain your beauty. She strives to have it all by overcompensating and in the process a few people will have to be dispatched and others suffer their own depravation, oops deprivation.Ravenna needs to obtain Snow White's heart to maintain that cute smirk.

Ravenna sends a forest savvy huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) to bring back Snow White.

And I had a feeling that this was going to be a pretty bad Snow White movie. But I gave it a chance because who knows it could have been a really great movie.Pros: Visually the fantasy was great I loved seeing the magical creatures and the forest and I liked how there was more of a back story to the Evil Queen as to why she became evil. The only good actors that shined were Chris Hemsworth (as the Huntsman)and Sam Claflin(as Prince William)and both actors were nice to look at too! But thats all.Cons: We already saw the best parts of the movie in the previews. The acting from Charlize Theron was over the top and she acted like a hormonal woman rather than an evil Queen. Kristen Stewerts acting as Snow White was terrible but not surprising. She had her mouth open a lot and didn't speak a whole lot except grunt and make sounds. She also had 2 looks on her face being confused or looking annoyed. And her british accent was akward and not believable. I also found out that many other actress's were considered for the part of Snow White but the director was probably desperate to make a movie. And the love triangle between her, The Huntsman and the Prince was ridiculous. It was like Twilight all over again. Sorry Twihards Edward and Jacob took a break from Bella! Can't we just have one main girl and one main guy be together? Enough already with the love triangles. Even with the love triangle when her true love kissed her YOU KNEW who he was and you knew who she was going to end up with. Even with the love triangle there wasn't enough romance.I think if the director wrote a better story and he had better actress's to play Snow White and the Evil Queen this movie would have stood a chance at doing great. But for people who haven't seen the movie yet I suggest you wait to watch it on t.v. or just rent it and then you decide whether its worth the buy or not.

Newby ""spikescreed""","[28, 38]","My wife and I had looked forward to this film only to be severely disappointed.The good in this film is entirely on Charlize Theron. Her acting is superb and you can tell that the other actors in this film are trying to rise to her level when they share scenes with her. Her queen is so evil it will give you shivers. Unfortunately, how scary-bad the rest of the film is will also give you shivers. As much as I like Chris Hemsworth, I couldn't help but feel that he was phoning this one in, at least a bit. Maybe because most of his scenes were opposite or adjascent to Kristen Stewart, I don't know for sure, but he never feels like more than a muscle-head in this film. It was like he wandered off of an action movie set and into the wrong studio. The dwarves had a lot of potential given the tremendous casting, but they are poorly used and underwhelming. The visuals are fantastic, but to be fair, they aren't anything unique in this CG-age of cinema. I didn't see anything new or innovative.Finally, I must jump on the bandwagon with everyone else - Kristen Stewart was dreadful. Aside from her complete lack of emotional output, I can't recall a scene in this film when her mouth was hanging open. By the end of the film, my wife and I had become so bored that we took to MST3k-ing the film, adding much dialogue about her gaping maw. It was the only way we could make it to the end. The Snow White of this film is supposed to draw great pathos from the audience, have a harrowing ordeal, and then transform into a brilliant warrior monarch. All of this is delivered with the emotional range of a mannequin. In a time when several versions of Snow White are hitting the market at once, you would think that the producers would want theirs to redefine the character, making her seem more than the fairy tale character.

This movie was a great retelling of a well known story, and the special effects are incredible.  The casting of Charlize Theron as the evil queen Ravenna was genius, and I think she deserved an Oscar for this role.  She truly was the best part of the movie despite the fact that she was the villain.  Chris Hemsworth did a great job too, and seems to be working hard to be more than just Thor.  This was also the first full length film for director Rupert Sanders and he did an amazing job for a film as ambitious as this one.  Unfortunately the producers cast Kristen Stewart in the title role, and that girl cannot act. The few movies that I have seen her in are just as bad acting wise, but she is still riding the coattails of the successful Twilight movies, but that seems to be coming to an end.  Thankfully this movie was great enough that I could mostly ignore her ineptitude.  She is the reason that I did not give this film 5 stars.  I have heard that they are planning to make a sequel, but due to Stewart's and Sanders affair (he was married) there is speculation that only one of them can return for it.  PLEASE let it be Sanders.  Many films in the past have had everything going for it from cast to costumes,  but without a great director leading all of those will mean nothing.

1473159,A28G7IGU6WHYV,B005LAIHSG,Bookwyrm,"[4, 8]","I expected to like this film if for no other reason than I expect Charlize Theron films to be of a high caliber--also, I like fairy tales.  I was not disappointed; in fact, I was pleasantly surprised.  I was expecting something like a fantasy-horror film, but it turned out to be much heavier on the fantasy element than is typically seen in contemporary mainstream movies.  This worked out quite well for me because I enjoy fantasy.  In fact, the movie reminded me of The Lord of the Rings trilogy in a few places, if only for the epic scene shots.In terms of the characters, Charlize Theron's Queen stole the show.  She was a character with some real depth, more fully fleshed out than I think I've ever seen the ""evil queen/stepmother"" character portrayed.  The Queen ended up being a far more compelling character than Snow White, in fact, because she felt more human.  She's not just some woman who turned to dark magic because she was vain and evil for the sake of being vain and evil; she's a traumatized, fearful woman who became cruel in a world SHE percieved to be dark and cruel.  As evil as she was, I pitied her--and THAT is a good villain. Theron did an excellent job bringing this character to life, and was, as always, stunningly beautiful.  I particularly like what she did with her voice, making it deep and round--it gave her a real presence.I've seen some reviews that complain about Kristen Stewart's role, but the truth of the matter is that Snow White is not the real protagonist of this movie in my opinion.  Snow White is written as a grail maiden in this film; a living embodiment of goodness and purity (and they're not subtle about it).  She has no flaws and does not grow at all during this movie, because she does not need to.  Her only real ""journey"" in this film is literal.  She is a plot device.  I think Stewart pulls this role off competently, if not with Theron's skill.The true protagonist of Snow White and the Huntsman is the Huntsman.  The Huntsman is an interesting character.  In the fairy tale, he pities Snow White and so lets her escape, fooling the Queen into believing he has killed her.  He takes a more active role in this movie.  It is his choices that allow the movie to take shape, and he is the character who grows the most in the film.  He makes an interesting foil for the Queen--they've both been shaped by trauma and bitterness and anger, but while the Queen embraces her bitterness, the Huntsman...well, I won't spoil it.  But HE is the character who has an inner journey, thus, to me, he is the protagonist; incidentally, he is also the narrator.  Helmsworth pulls the character off nicely.  He's always fun to look at, and he's managed to bring the charaters he plays to life in unique ways in every movie I've seen him in.  In fact, even though I recognized him, I had to double check that he was who I thought he was because his Huntsman was so different from Papa Kirk and Thor.  And I really enjoyed the accent (although I admit I probably wouldn't be able to recognize a bad one if I heard it).One of my favorite things about this movie is its take on love.  In the fairytale, it is true love's kiss that awakens Snow White from death.  In this movie, I don't think they mean for that love to be seen as 'romantic'.  I'm not sure how to explain it without spoiling the movie, but I enjoy the nontraditional presentation.There are a few things I think could have been done better.  I would have liked the film to either make Snow White more of a character and less of a plot device, or fully embrace the Huntsman as the main character.  It waffled, and that's the reason that the villain was the most impactful character in the movie.  I also would have liked to see them do more with the other characters.  The dwarves were interesting, but William and his foil, the Queen's brother, had potential they didn't really live up to (I think the actors did a good job, but the characters just weren't given the chance to develop fully in the plot)--and most of the other characters were just background.  The movie had some breathtaking scenes, but was a little too heavy on the computer graphics at the same time.  But overall I really enjoyed the movie.",5,A pleasant surprise,1347580800,"09 14, 2012",2012,4216,"['expected', 'like', 'film', 'other', 'reason', 'expect', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'films', 'be', 'high', 'caliber', 'also', 'like', 'fairy', 'tales', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'fact', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'was', 'expecting', 'something', 'fantasy-horror', 'film', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'much', 'heavier', 'fantasy', 'element', 'typically', 'seen', 'contemporary', 'mainstream', 'movies', 'worked', 'out', 'quite', 'well', 'enjoy', 'fantasy', 'fact', 'movie', 'reminded', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'trilogy', 'few', 'places', 'only', 'epic', 'scene', 'shots.In', 'terms', 'characters', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'Queen', 'stole', 'show', 'was', 'character', 'real', 'depth', 'more', 'fully', 'fleshed', 'out', 'think', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'evil', 'queen/stepmother', 'character', 'portrayed', 'Queen', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'far', 'more', 'compelling', 'character', 'Snow', 'White', 'fact', 'felt', 'more', 'human', 'not', 'just', 'woman', 'who', 'turned', 'dark', 'magic', 'was', 'vain', 'evil', 'sake', 'being', 'vain', 'evil', 'traumatized', 'fearful', 'woman', 'who', 'became', 'cruel', 'world', 'SHE', 'percieved', 'be', 'dark', 'cruel', 'As', 'evil', 'was', 'pitied', 'good', 'villain', 'Theron', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'bringing', 'character', 'life', 'was', 'always', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'particularly', 'what', 'did', 'voice', 'making', 'deep', 'round', 'gave', 'real', 'presence.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'reviews', 'complain', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'role', 'truth', 'matter', 'Snow', 'White', 'not', 'real', 'protagonist', 'movie', 'opinion', 'Snow', 'White', 'written', 'grail', 'maiden', 'film', 'living', 'embodiment', 'goodness', 'purity', ""'re"", 'not', 'subtle', 'flaws', 'not', 'grow', 'movie', 'not', 'need', 'only', 'real', 'journey', 'film', 'literal', 'plot', 'device', 'think', 'Stewart', 'role', 'off', 'competently', 'not', 'Theron', 'skill.The', 'true', 'protagonist', 'Snow', 'White', 'Huntsman', 'Huntsman', 'Huntsman', 'interesting', 'character', 'fairy', 'tale', 'Snow', 'White', 'so', 'escape', 'fooling', 'Queen', 'believing', 'killed', 'more', 'active', 'role', 'movie', 'choices', 'allow', 'movie', 'take', 'shape', 'character', 'who', 'most', 'film', 'interesting', 'foil', 'Queen', ""'ve"", 'been', 'shaped', 'trauma', 'bitterness', 'anger', 'Queen', 'bitterness', 'Huntsman', 'well', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'HE', 'character', 'who', 'inner', 'journey', 'thus', 'protagonist', 'incidentally', 'also', 'narrator', 'Helmsworth', 'character', 'off', 'nicely', 'always', 'fun', 'look', 'managed', 'bring', 'charaters', 'life', 'unique', 'ways', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'fact', 'even', 'recognized', 'had', 'double', 'check', 'was', 'who', 'thought', 'was', 'Huntsman', 'was', 'so', 'different', 'Papa', 'Kirk', 'Thor', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'accent', 'admit', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'recognize', 'bad', 'one', 'heard', '.One', 'favorite', 'things', 'movie', 'take', 'love', 'fairytale', 'true', 'love', 'kiss', 'Snow', 'White', 'death', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'mean', 'love', 'be', 'seen', ""'romantic"", ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'explain', 'spoiling', 'movie', 'enjoy', 'nontraditional', 'presentation.There', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'better', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'film', 'make', 'Snow', 'White', 'more', 'character', 'less', 'plot', 'device', 'fully', 'embrace', 'Huntsman', 'main', 'character', 'waffled', 'reason', 'villain', 'was', 'most', 'impactful', 'character', 'movie', 'also', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'do', 'more', 'other', 'characters', 'dwarves', 'were', 'interesting', 'William', 'foil', 'Queen', 'brother', 'had', 'potential', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'live', 'up', 'think', 'actors', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'characters', 'just', 'were', ""n't"", 'given', 'chance', 'develop', 'fully', 'plot', 'most', 'other', 'characters', 'were', 'just', 'background', 'movie', 'had', 'breathtaking', 'scenes', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'heavy', 'computer', 'graphics', 'same', 'time', 'overall', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie']",N/A

I'm neither impressed by Chris Hemsworth's muscles, nor rabid over how Kristen Stewart's affair with director Rupert Sanders screwed over her ""Twilight"" co-star and ex(?)boyfriend Robert Pattinson.That said, I hope I've just established my credibility when it comes to reviewing this film.And I liked it just fine.""Snow White and the Huntsman"" is an interesting, well-acted, enjoyable yet violent take on the Brothers Grimm tale, and one can certainly do worse than sitting down to enjoy it.Though Stewart and Hemsworth and competent in their roles, the real stars of the tale are Charlize Theron and the CGI effects...both accomplishing their tasks splendidly throughout the film.Theron does a stellar job--as is her habit--playing Ravenna, the Evil Queen.  Her quest to be the most beautiful woman in her kingdom is so malevolent even plant life perishes throughout the region.  And Theron seems to relish the role, thoroughly encompassing a cold, heartless woman who maintains herself by quite literally sucking the life out of every fair woman she encounters.  It is safe to say that it is Theron who ""owns"" this film, and it is she whom you will recall longest after the movie has ended.As for the CGI, as always it ran the risk of overwhelming the film.  Here, however, I felt it performed its task of embellishment the movie with the technique necessary to tell the tale, and when it did draw attention to itself it was only to marvel how well this was accomplished, much in the manner of beautiful scenery or great acting.  As in, say, the ""Harry Potter"" films, it seldom drew away from the experience of watching the film, instead enhancing it in a necessary and stunning manner.Chief among these moments would be Ravenna's magic mirror, to whom she makes the well known chant of ""who's the fairest of them all?""  Instead of merely reflecting her or invoking the image of the spirit within it, the mirror turned liquid, gloopily oozing down from its perch onto the floor only to rise in the evocation of a being under a shroud--a very eerie image indeed.  (I would have enjoyed seeing it get back upon the wall, but the movie did not supply that moment, alas.)Additionally, the seven (initially eight) dwarves were quite effectively performed by normal-sized actors (including Brian Gleeson, Ian McShane and Bob Hoskins) whose faces were melded upon the heads of smaller actors.  It was seamlessly accomplished, though I did hear it created some resentment among ""little"" actors who felt slighted by their seeming exclusion.I felt that Stewart and Hemsworth were fine, though I felt that their roles could have been performed by any other actors--in particular Stewart, whom I have never really felt is that accomplished an actress, nor certainly the ""beauty"" who would drive Theron into any jealous rage.  As for director Sanders, for whom ""Snow White"" was his first feature film, I felt the movie was nicely balanced and paced, and made for a very enjoyable afternoon.All in all, a pleasant movie, and satisfying.  My only statement of caution applies to parents of  impressionable youngsters: you might be wise to take the tykes elsewhere, as the violence may unsettle them.",4,A Pleasing Re-Telling of the Tale,1355097600,"12 10, 2012",2012,3231,"['Right', 'bat', ""'m"", 'not', 'teenaged', 'girl', ""'m"", 'impressed', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'muscles', 'rabid', 'how', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'affair', 'director', 'Rupert', 'Sanders', 'screwed', 'Twilight', 'co-star', 'ex', 'boyfriend', 'Robert', 'Pattinson.That', 'said', 'hope', ""'ve"", 'just', 'established', 'credibility', 'when', 'reviewing', 'film.And', 'liked', 'just', 'fine', 'Snow', 'White', 'Huntsman', 'interesting', 'well-acted', 'enjoyable', 'yet', 'violent', 'take', 'Brothers', 'Grimm', 'tale', 'one', 'can', 'certainly', 'do', 'worse', 'sitting', 'down', 'enjoy', 'it.Though', 'Stewart', 'Hemsworth', 'competent', 'roles', 'real', 'stars', 'tale', 'are', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'CGI', 'effects', 'accomplishing', 'tasks', 'splendidly', 'film.Theron', 'stellar', 'job', 'habit', 'playing', 'Ravenna', 'Evil', 'Queen', 'quest', 'be', 'most', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'kingdom', 'so', 'malevolent', 'even', 'plant', 'life', 'perishes', 'region', 'Theron', 'relish', 'role', 'thoroughly', 'encompassing', 'cold', 'heartless', 'woman', 'who', 'quite', 'literally', 'sucking', 'life', 'fair', 'woman', 'safe', 'say', 'Theron', 'who', 'film', 'whom', 'will', 'recall', 'longest', 'movie', 'ended.As', 'CGI', 'always', 'ran', 'risk', 'overwhelming', 'film', 'Here', 'however', 'felt', 'performed', 'task', 'embellishment', 'movie', 'technique', 'necessary', 'tell', 'tale', 'when', 'did', 'draw', 'attention', 'was', 'only', 'marvel', 'how', 'well', 'was', 'accomplished', 'much', 'manner', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'great', 'acting', 'say', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'films', 'seldom', 'drew', 'away', 'experience', 'watching', 'film', 'instead', 'enhancing', 'necessary', 'stunning', 'manner.Chief', 'moments', 'would', 'be', 'Ravenna', 'magic', 'mirror', 'whom', 'well', 'known', 'chant', 'who', 'fairest', 'Instead', 'merely', 'reflecting', 'invoking', 'image', 'spirit', 'mirror', 'turned', 'liquid', 'gloopily', 'oozing', 'down', 'perch', 'floor', 'only', 'rise', 'evocation', 'being', 'shroud', 'very', 'eerie', 'image', 'indeed', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'get', 'back', 'wall', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'supply', 'moment', 'alas', 'Additionally', 'seven', 'initially', 'eight', 'dwarves', 'were', 'quite', 'effectively', 'performed', 'normal-sized', 'actors', 'including', 'Brian', 'Gleeson', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'were', 'melded', 'heads', 'smaller', 'actors', 'was', 'seamlessly', 'accomplished', 'did', 'hear', 'created', 'resentment', 'little', 'actors', 'who', 'felt', 'slighted', 'seeming', 'exclusion.I', 'felt', 'Stewart', 'Hemsworth', 'were', 'fine', 'felt', 'roles', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'performed', 'other', 'actors', 'particular', 'Stewart', 'whom', 'have', 'never', 'really', 'felt', 'accomplished', 'actress', 'certainly', 'beauty', 'who', 'would', 'drive', 'Theron', 'jealous', 'rage', 'director', 'Sanders', 'whom', 'Snow', 'White', 'was', 'first', 'feature', 'film', 'felt', 'movie', 'was', 'nicely', 'balanced', 'paced', 'made', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'afternoon.All', 'pleasant', 'movie', 'satisfying', 'only', 'statement', 'caution', 'applies', 'parents', 'impressionable', 'youngsters', 'might', 'be', 'wise', 'take', 'tykes', 'elsewhere', 'violence', 'may', 'unsettle']",N/A

Personally, I find films such as ""Lord of the Rings"" to be unwatchable (sorry to you fans out there but the truth is the truth).  Usually, I just find that these types of films are problematic in many ways, mostly that I just can't connect with the characters and therefore can't have empathy for them.  Not so with ""Snow White and the Huntsman.""  Most of the characters I could relate to, but surely the star of the show - be it a dark star - would be Charlize Theron.One of the only complaints that I might have about the film is that Ms. Theron nearly disappears midstream, but luckily she reappears to bring back her madness and mayhem in the third act.  Another complaint would be:  a little too much exposition by some of our characters.  Not to give too much away - you already know most of the story since naturally this is a take on the original fairy tale - but when someone wants to kiss our protagonist, Kristen Stewart, our knight in shining armor (or maybe make that ""knight in shining pewter"" perhaps) - decides to first discuss, to no one in particular, his life story.  But of course, it is easier to explain background information in a novel than it is in film.  Too bad, but often screenwriters must bite the bullet and use exposition to explain things, which comes across in a klunky fashion.  Just kiss her already!But besides these complaints, the cinematography and costume design are fantastic.  Same goes for the special effects.  And the acting is even mostly good, even Ms. Stewart is better in this role than the ""Twilight"" series.But the acting by our antagonist is superb.

Or so it would seem... It is difficult to tell exactly what is going on throughout the threadbare plot in SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN. Sure, it looks pretty, but the big-budget special effects cannot hide the fact that SNOW WHITE makes very few attempts at telling a compelling story. Kristen Stewart stars as our slack-jawed and angst-ridden heroine (if you can call her that). Snow White spends the majority of the film fleeing through the woods with the aid of The Hunstman (Chris Hemsworth), before suddenly and confusingly becoming the leader of a major rebellion against The Queen. The term 'contrived' receives a whole new meaning in the film's brisk 2-hour run time. Charlize Theron is given a few moments to shine as Ravenna, but if any praise is due at all, it must be given to the set designers, who have brilliantly dressed everything from the brooding castles to the enchanted forests.

A dark, romantic epic tinged with magic is what Snow White & the Huntsman aspired to. Alas, the fatal combination of a lack of chemistry and a lackluster musical score make it a somewhat pondering experience.The trailers make this look like an action-packed epic in the tradition of earlier box office franchises like The Lord of the Rings. There are some good things about it, like the exquisite costume designs by Colleen Atwood. Some scenes are very well written and staged, among them the infamous apple sequence. And the cast is quite good... it's just too bad they don't have better material, in the hands of a more experienced director, to work with. Sometimes films just don't work. It can be a combination of things. For me, this one fell flat. There is no chemistry between the leads. Most of the music is either nonexistent or completely underwhelming. A decent score by an A-list composer would have done wonders for a script that meanders a bit and is downright dull at times. It is full of good ideas that aren't executed to the best of abilities.

A true sign of that is the epic performance of the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies and the giddiness in many that a ""Hobbit"" trailer foretells of another. ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" is no ""Lord of the Rings"", but a more fair comparison would be to a movie like ""Legend"". It isn't perfect, but it is without question a worthy addition to the short list of fantasy adventure movies that Hollywood sometimes backs.""Snow White and the Huntsman"" has many qualities but the most standout one of those, even above the knockout special effects, is the performance of Oscar winner Charlize Theron (""Monster"", ""Reindeer Games""). She is haunting in her portrayal of the evil Queen Raveena. Like every great actress does, she took her role and made it hers, unique and hypnotizing. The torment that she goes through to remain on top of the spell she has been saddled with is something you can't take your eyes off. Theron is having a big time summer, because next week she'll appear in ""Prometheus"".""Snow White and the Huntsman"" is also gifted with amazing special effects. The images and cinematography of the film rival that of ""Legend"" or ""Lord of the Rings"" easily. Although there are moments where, as the band who are protecting Snow White travel, I couldn't help but think of ""Lord of the Rings"" and that's never a good thing. The sweeping sceneries and orchestra music were too similar to ""Rings"". This can be overlooked because it is so fleeting.Kristen Stewart (""Twilight"", ""Zathura"", ""Panic Room"") plays Snow White and as much as I wasn't sure of her acting abilities, I'm more confident now that she's capable. Sometimes I feel she leaves her urgency and emotion behind and maybe that's a sign of a person who started acting when she was nine. An acting career was sort of put at her footstep before she knew how to achieve it. She is twenty-two now and has been in many successful films. There are moments in the film that are a little over dramatized as she works soldiers into frenzy like Joan of Arc, but all in all, she was ""Snow White"" and she did the movie justice.""Snow White and the Huntsman"" is certainly not perfect and it is certainly not going to be one of the most talked about movies of the summer. Yet, in a summer full of superheroes, aliens and talking teddy bears, it is the only adventure fantasy until ""The Hobbit"" comes along in December. If you enjoy movies with mythical creatures, unstoppable evil's and heroes emerging, then ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" might just be a good fit for you.",3,THERON awesome...

Here as the evil witch, and in ""Prometheus"" as Meredith Vickers.  She's got the villain role down pat, I would say.  And in my opinion, she stole the scenes from Kristen Stewart and Chris Hemsworth in this movie.  Overall, this is a very enjoyable movie.  Just be forewarned that it's not going to follow the same exact plot as the original tale that you heard as a child.Kristen Stewart plays the main character, Snow White.  Life starts off pretty good for her, being the daughter of the king.  While she was still young, a woman pretending to be a damsel in distress wins over her father's affections.  This woman, Ravenna, weds the king and becomes her stepmother.  Ravenna eventually murders the king and brings in her own army to take control of the castle.  Snow White is sent to confinement and spends much of her childhood in a locked room.  Eventually, she gets out and escapes into the haunted forest.  The Queen sends a reluctant huntsman to track down Snow White.  The Huntsman, who is suffering from personal issues of his own, falls for Snow.Anyway, this show portrays the story a little bit differently from the original story.  That's not necessarily a bad thing.  The TV show, 'Once Upon a Time"", also put their own twists on the Snow White story.  I suppose you have to make the story more appealing to different generations of viewers.  The production and the special effects are top notch.  The costumes and the sets are also well-made.  They are what you would expect from a high-budget movie.  There are plenty of memorable scenes in this movie.  I particularly enjoyed the scenes with Queen Ravenna and her magic mirror.  And the movie wisely took the time to invest in Ravenna's backstory, to give her character more depth.What we did not get much of is the Huntsman's backstory.  We are told that he was married and lost his wife.  Chris Hemsworth was fine for the role.  He pulled it off and carried the part well, in other words.  He was believable.  Kirsten Stewart, ofcourse, was more than capable of playing her role.  Her Snow possess a physical and a martial prowess that the original Snow from the storybook did not have.

I think that Chris Hemsworth's and Charlize Theron are two very talented actors( the only reason I did not give it one star), but would somebody please tell me why Kristen Stewart gets millions for doing movies. If sucking in your breath and popping a tear out of your eye and mumbling your lines is all that is required then I qualify to be an actress. I started watching and Snow White as a little girl was alright. Then cut to the grown-up and yuck. As long as she does not talk it is better. Frankly, I could not wait for Chris Hemsworth to show up on screen, and as far as I am concerned he did not show up fast enough. The one funny line has The Huntsman cutting away her dress and she looks at him like she thinks he is going to ravage her. He looks at her and says "" don't flatter yourself"". That sums up just about everything about her. Watching them plod through the forest is torture.  The actors who play the dwarves are hilarious, they steal the movie. The scene where the two male leads talk about the inner light of Snow White and how you have to be blind not to see it, made me wonder if they got through that without gagging. To be blunt the most exciting thing about the movie was finding out she was not so snowy white and was sleeping with the director. I saw they were planning a sequel and I would like to know what for? I do believe they are plotting a spin-off for the huntsman, and if Chris Hemsworth is doing it I will be the first in line. Just not more of this same drivel.

1473243,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B005LAIHSG,C. Sawin,"[4, 7]","""Snow White and the Huntsman"" is visually extraordinary right from the start. Scenes featuring snow are always more memorable. Maybe its due to its lack of color or the way the snow seems to be falling so rapidly and yet so slowly at the same time, but ""Snow White"" plays this up on more than one occasion. Its $170 million budget is tossed around constantly with nearly every time Ravenna (Charlize Theron) is on screen or when her dark army is struck with something and shatters. The Mirror Man in Ravenna's mirror is also extremely impressive.The cast is extremely solid. Charlize Theron does seem to over do it at times, but is mostly just extremely passionate about her goals, quick tempered, and borderline insane. Chris Hemsworth puts on a pretty decent Scottish accent as The Hunstman isn't a completely different spin on the characters we're used to seeing Hemsworth play, but adds just enough (being a drunk and completely miserable) to make it seem slightly different. The dwarves may be what saves the entire film though. They're both technically useful and provide enough comic relief from the grim tale that's being told to make the film way better than it should be.The big issue though is that ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" feels like it borrows from a lot of movies you already love. The most obvious one being that the movie evolves into feeling like a junior or lite version of ""The Hobbit"" due later this year. The most impressive visual sequence is when the characters enter the dark forest. That entire sequence feels like it's pulled directly out of ""Princess Mononoke."" While Kristen Stewart is more than likely not on everyone's list of favorite actresses, she's actually pretty okay here. It's difficult to argue with only seeing rabbit teeth whenever she's on screen though.The score is a lot like the movie, as well. There are moments of brilliance, but it seems to get overzealous at times and collapses on itself. What's odd is that the movie seems to cater to Bob Hoskins character of Muir. He's always got something to say about the princess and his introduction is stretched out the longest. When Snow White finally heads off to deal with Ravenna, the camera zooms in on Muir just so he can say, ""Farewell, princess!"" It just seemed very bizarre and out of place at times. Bob Hoskins is awesome, but taking the time to hear what Muir had to say so often didn't always fit with what was going on.""Snow White and the Huntsman"" has style dripping from every frame of celluloid and features incredible imagery. The performances are mostly very entertaining, the score is fairly satisfying, and its special effects are just extremely well done and pure bliss for your eyes. The way the movie borrows from so many beloved franchises though and its rather bittersweet ending threw a monkey wrench into the works of fully enjoying of what this could have been.

Wend,"[2, 4]","Snow White and the Huntsman is a refreshing look at movie fairly tales, much closer to the literary stories than the sanitized Disney versions. The film keeps the basic story of an evil witch and the purity of Snow White while adding a sinister forest with a deadly troll and an enchanted fairy inhabited forest.  The dwarves are also part of the film, played by Ian McShane, Ray Winstone, Bob Hoskins and Toby Jones, among others, filmed in close-ups with dwarf stand-ins used for long shots.  They provide comic relief and fight heroically for Snow White.Charlize Theron as Ravenna gives a marvelous performance as Snow White's evil stepmother, who kills her husband King Magnus on their wedding night and seizes the throne for herself.  She clearly relished the role. On the other hand, Chris Helmsworth (as the Huntsman) and Kristen Stewart (Snow White) do not connect emotionally and their relationship never catches fire. Kristen Stewart does not bring a lot of passion to her role. She does a good job looking the part of a princess but it was disappointing at the end of the film when Snow White is crowned, looking regal, but has no lines to say to sum up her character. The film, at over two-hours long, moves rather slowly and there was a couple of scenes that I found could have been cut without harming the plot.Perhaps the real star of Snow White and the Huntsman are the special effects, costumes and cinematography.  The film production is beautiful with the design of the forest, enchanted garden and castle adding to make the story much more engaging.  The score by James Newton Howard captures the mood of the film very well.

I guess I just like the cartoon version better because it was so comical in it's telling of the fairy tale. And Chris Hemsworth did a pretty bang up job as the Huntsman but I don't see the correlation between this version and the disney cartoon one. Some of the special effects kept me wondering too and the evil queen's wardrobe was pretty cool.

1473309,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,B005LAIHSG,Dr. James Gardner,"[17, 26]","""Snow White"" was originally a European fairy tale made famous as one of the Grimm Brothers 1812 collection. It appeared in a 1916 silent film and a 1933 Betty Boop cartoon before achieving eternal fame in the 1937 Disney animated feature. That film was the first full length animated feature, was #1 at the box office in 1938, won an Honorary Oscar, and earned a spot (#49) on AFIs list of the best films of all time.Since 1937 the story has been reprised on occasion - ""Snow White and the 3 Stooges"" (1961), ""Snow White"" (1987), ""Snow White: A Tale of Terror"" (1997), ""Sydney White"" (2007), and ""Mirror Mirror"" (2012).The most recent version, ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" is a 2012 fantasy with Charlise Theron as the wicked queen, Kristen Stewart as Snow White, and Chris Hemsworth as the huntsman.South Africa born Charlise Theron is the Oscar winning actress (""Monster"" 2003) who has been in more than two dozen films including ""North Country"" (2005), ""The Italian Job"" (2003), and ""Men of Honor"" (2000). Her role as the wicked queen is one of her worst performances ever.Kristen Stewart is best known from the ""Twilight Saga"" films. The buck toothed tom boy is certainly attractive, but no beauty, and far from the ""fairest in the land."" Indeed Charlise Theron clearly retains the title.Chris Hemsworth is best known as ""Thor"" from the film of the same name and the subsequent ""The Avengers"" (2012). He should probably stick with this genre. His performance is uneven, and he certainly doesn't fill the need for a hero in a film like this.The script is all inclusive - they not only manage to keep much of the original story, they add gigantic trolls, gnomes, a tribe of women without men, fairies, a 20 point white antelope, and 8 dwarfs. That's right - 8. Count `em yourself. One dies, so in the end there are only 7.This is such a bad film, and it goes on for hours and hours, the only redeeming quality is some beautiful photography. There are some nice special effects, as when the wicked queen seems to be composed of a group of crows. But they overuse this special effect - trees consist of butterflies, the antelope consists of white birds - so that it gets tiresome after awhile.In the end, the story itself cannot be resolved, but I can't reveal this without spoiling the film for those who choose to see it. But I can't imagine who that would be. It's not suitable for kids, and there's not enough action for adrenaline junkies, nor enough fantasy for the sword and sorcery crowd. Fans of romance will also be disappointed, and people looking for the dark side will probably not find enough darkness here.Bottom line - a poor film that doesn't do justice to the story nor to the excellent 1937 film.",2,A poor update to a classic favorite,1338595200,"06 2, 2012",2012,2716,"['Snow', 'White', 'was', 'originally', 'European', 'fairy', 'tale', 'made', 'famous', 'one', 'Grimm', 'Brothers', '1812', 'collection', 'appeared', '1916', 'silent', 'film', '1933', 'Betty', 'Boop', 'cartoon', 'achieving', 'eternal', 'fame', '1937', 'Disney', 'animated', 'feature', 'film', 'was', 'first', 'full', 'length', 'animated', 'feature', 'was', '1', 'box', 'office', '1938', 'won', 'Honorary', 'Oscar', 'earned', 'spot', '49', 'AFIs', 'list', 'best', 'films', 'time.Since', '1937', 'story', 'been', 'reprised', 'occasion', 'Snow', 'White', '3', 'Stooges', '1961', 'Snow', 'White', '1987', 'Snow', 'White', 'Tale', 'Terror', '1997', 'Sydney', 'White', '2007', 'Mirror', 'Mirror', '2012', 'most', 'recent', 'version', 'Snow', 'White', 'Huntsman', '2012', 'fantasy', 'Charlise', 'Theron', 'wicked', 'queen', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'Snow', 'White', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'huntsman.South', 'Africa', 'Charlise', 'Theron', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'actress', 'Monster', '2003', 'who', 'been', 'more', 'two', 'dozen', 'films', 'including', 'North', 'Country', '2005', 'Italian', 'Job', '2003', 'Men', 'Honor', '2000', 'role', 'wicked', 'queen', 'one', 'worst', 'performances', 'ever.Kristen', 'Stewart', 'best', 'known', 'Twilight', 'Saga', 'films', 'buck', 'toothed', 'tom', 'boy', 'certainly', 'attractive', 'beauty', 'far', 'fairest', 'land', 'Indeed', 'Charlise', 'Theron', 'clearly', 'title.Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'best', 'known', 'Thor', 'film', 'same', 'name', 'subsequent', 'Avengers', '2012', 'should', 'probably', 'stick', 'genre', 'performance', 'uneven', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'fill', 'need', 'hero', 'film', 'this.The', 'script', 'inclusive', 'not', 'only', 'manage', 'keep', 'much', 'original', 'story', 'add', 'gigantic', 'trolls', 'gnomes', 'tribe', 'women', 'men', 'fairies', '20', 'point', 'white', 'antelope', '8', 'dwarfs', 'right', '8', 'Count', 'em', 'One', 'so', 'end', 'are', 'only', '7.This', 'such', 'bad', 'film', 'hours', 'hours', 'only', 'redeeming', 'quality', 'beautiful', 'photography', 'are', 'nice', 'special', 'effects', 'when', 'wicked', 'queen', 'be', 'composed', 'group', 'crows', 'overuse', 'special', 'effect', 'trees', 'consist', 'butterflies', 'antelope', 'white', 'birds', 'so', 'tiresome', 'end', 'story', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'resolved', 'ca', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'spoiling', 'film', 'who', 'choose', 'see', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'not', 'suitable', 'kids', 'not', 'enough', 'action', 'adrenaline', 'junkies', 'enough', 'fantasy', 'sword', 'sorcery', 'crowd', 'Fans', 'romance', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'disappointed', 'people', 'looking', 'dark', 'side', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'find', 'enough', 'darkness', 'here.Bottom', 'line', 'poor', 'film', ""n't"", 'do', 'justice', 'story', 'excellent', '1937', 'film']",N/A

1473312,A2TXR85WQLE32N,B005LAIHSG,D. S. Thurlow,"[0, 0]","""Snow White and the Huntsman"" is not the Walt Disney version of the popular fairy tale.  This is a dark, gritty reimagining of the legend, in which Snow White's stepmother Ravenna murders the King, usurps the throne, and locks up the young Snow White in a tower.  The new Queen (Charlize Theron) sustains herself by absorbing the youth and beauty of young women, instantly aging them, while the whole kingdom takes on a deathly pallor.The audience meets a now grown Snow White (Kirsten Stewart) clinging to her faith in a filthy, freezing and lonely cell in a tower.  She manages to escape when the Queen's brother attempts to molest her.  She runs for her life in a dark forest, pursued by the Queen's henchmen, and by a huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) who ends up being an uncertain ally.Magic is a key theme of the movie, whether the evil variety used so skillfully by the Queen, or the good magic exercised, sometimes unconsciously, by Snow White.  Snow White will survive a terrifying journey through the dark forest to an enchanted portion where she comes to understand her own powers.  Thus fortified, she will rally her father's remaining loyal subjects for a dramatic confrontation with the Queen.""Snow White"" is a surprisingly entertaining movie.  The special effects are good to excellent, and Charlize Theron steals the movie, managing to portray a rounded character despite her necessary status as the villainess of the story.  There is some good location shooting around Britain and Ireland, and the supporting cast has lots of solid British actors behind the beards and underneath the armor.  The final duel between Snow White and the evil Queen is quite suspenseful, even though we think we know how it is supposed to turn out.

It completely surprised me that there was no real romance here, was this intentional, or a case of the writers not wanting to go there?  Since Snow White already had her long lost childhood love, who really wasn't a love, as it turned out, most of the story dealt with our heroine hiding from her evil step-mother and all of the things she went through to destroy the lovely Snow White.

I thought the imagery surrounding the wicked Queen Ravenna was done well (her whole look gets darker as the movie progresses) and some of the effects were interesting, such as the mirror and when she transformed back into human form from her ravens.  I felt there were several areas the story didn't explain too well, like when Snow White asked the Huntsman to escort her to the Duke.  It took me awhile to actually figure out who that was supposed to be (and why was he so far away?).  I mean, I knew William and his father got away, but I didn't know he was the Duke.  Hubby thought William was her brother initially....

It's an ambitious, spiritless, CGI-fest stretched beyond all endurance.  That it took four people to pen the screenplay says a lot about the way the story meanders aimlessly, employing the `stacked deck' theory of writing, until it finally fizzles with a whimper of an ending.  The other part of the problem is deciding which lead actress to blame for an outstanding show of mediocrity.  Most of Charlize Theron's performance is due to special effects and a great deal of posing, otherwise she only hit two notes, screeching ineffectively and just standing there trying to look pretty.  Kristen Stewart, on the other hand, did nothing to inspire that much devotion, she is simply incapable of emoting with any amount of credibility.  That they are planning a sequel with her in the starring role begs the question why.

It seems like Hollywood thinks we need a ""realistic"" version of fairy tales and that realism = gritty violence.The formula sometimes works but not as often as Hollywood thinks. In this case, I think it's a partial success. I think the grittier aspects sometimes work. I love the new dwarves. They have a much more forceful personality. They're a bit off-putting, which I think actually works for dwarves as they're from the fantasy realm. There's also a good mix of dwarf characters, from the grungy to the more mystical.The wicked Queen on the other hand is a mixed bag. Charlize Theron is wonderful in her performance. She manages to add a layer of pain and frustration underneath the surface of what could easily have been a one-dimensional villain. However, the attempts to give her greater powers fell flat. First, seeing her suck the ""youth"" of of people was a bit silly. Second, the special effects have that CGI look (note to directors: use CGI sparingly. CGI rarely looks realistic). The scene of her taking a ""milk bath"" really pulled me out of the film as it just looked like early 1990s computer animation.Kristen Stewart as Snow White is OK, but not exactly memorable. One gets the sense that she's a passive character in the movie, possibly because Stewart doesn't bring the character much weight.The pacing of the movie is also off. It's clear that the director had trouble in the editing room and not surprisingly there is an extended version (which I haven't seen). Some scenes seem far too short, almost pointless. Others, such as the introduction of the Huntsman, don't have much impact. I suspect the romantic connection between the Huntsman and Snow White was also a victim of editing as it's not even clear why his kiss would be the one to wake her up. If I'd liked the movie a bit more, I definitely would try to get the extended version. Unfortunately, the distributor only allows Netflix to send the theatrical version.Small point - if the whole crux of the plot is that the wicked Queen feels threatened by Snow White's beauty, then it would have been helpful to have had an actress who was more beautiful than Charlize Theron play Snow White. Despite the age difference, Kristen Stewart just doesn't hold a candle to Charlize Theron in that department.

1473340,ASIEGG17K1UID,B005LAIHSG,"Ex-Buyer ""Thomas""","[2, 3]","Let's start with a question that kept going through my mind as I watched this movie...why do all &#34;fairy tales&#34; have a &#34;black forest?&#34;  The idea of an evil area filled with trees seem to play a major role in every tale. This led to my second question I kept asking...why can't Stewart act her way out of a paper bag?As many have already stated, the script is just dreadful...possibly one of the worse scripts ever for a fantasy/horror/sci fi movie one will ever have to sit threw. Theron and Helmsworth to their best in trying to make lemonade from lemons...even as gifted actors they are, they are having issues, but they try, they try. Stewart we will leave for later.The sets, effects and cinematography are worth the price of the movie, it is visually a stunning piece of cinema. This may be the sole reason I gave this 4 stars. What lacks in script and to an extent acting, it makes up in the visual.Theron and Helmsworth as I previously stated do their best with what they have to work with...Theron plays villain extremely well and even when she is suppose to be &#34;ugly&#34; she still is beautiful. Helsworth is just beautiful, he plays the reluctant hero to a perfection. I am being partial as I like both actors body of work. Once again, they have the ability, all be it minor, to make lemonade out of this lemon of a script.Then there is Stewart. T call her an actor is an insult to the craft. If you hated her in the Twilight series, you will loathe her in this. First and foremost, as in Twilight, all she can do is stare with a blank expression into the camera, and there there is the &#34;tick&#34; sound she makes when she is not sure what to do, what her line is, or has to emote. She did it all through Twilight and she does it throughout this movie. Perhaps it is her &#34;signature&#34; trademark...whatever it is, it is all she is able to do as an &#34;actor.&#34;  Poor Theron and Helmsworth look exhausted in the scenes they are in with her...and for Helsworth that is a fair part of the movie. (Oh, before I forget the &#34;extended&#34; version is too long, especially with Stewart...watch the theatrical version instead.) Anyway, back to Stewart bashing...also, to say she is fairer than Theron is a stretch at best, and a lie in the least. Why do people thinks she is attractive, she is not. So for her to play the &#34;fairest of them all&#34; plays against type. But then as in Twilight, there must be something 20 year old boys like in her, though I am completely clueless as to the answer.So, in ending, this is a great movie from a cinematography standpoint, a good movie if you like the work of Theron and Helmsworth and a dreadful movie in terms of script and pacing (again, skip the extended version) and as far as Stewart...enough said.",4,More like Snow Black,1394064000,"03 6, 2014",2014,2789,"['Let', 'start', 'question', 'kept', 'going', 'mind', 'watched', 'movie', 'why', 'do', '34', 'fairy', '34', 'have', '34', 'black', 'forest', '34', 'idea', 'evil', 'area', 'filled', 'trees', 'seem', 'play', 'major', 'role', 'tale', 'led', 'second', 'question', 'kept', 'asking', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'Stewart', 'act', 'way', 'paper', 'bag', 'many', 'have', 'already', 'stated', 'script', 'just', 'dreadful', 'possibly', 'one', 'worse', 'ever', 'fantasy/horror/sci', 'fi', 'movie', 'one', 'will', 'ever', 'have', 'sit', 'threw', 'Theron', 'Helmsworth', 'best', 'trying', 'make', 'lemonade', 'lemons', 'even', 'gifted', 'actors', 'are', 'are', 'having', 'issues', 'try', 'try', 'Stewart', 'will', 'leave', 'later.The', 'sets', 'effects', 'cinematography', 'are', 'price', 'movie', 'visually', 'stunning', 'piece', 'cinema', 'may', 'be', 'sole', 'reason', 'gave', '4', 'stars', 'What', 'script', 'extent', 'acting', 'up', 'visual.Theron', 'Helmsworth', 'previously', 'stated', 'do', 'best', 'what', 'have', 'work', 'Theron', 'villain', 'extremely', 'well', 'even', 'when', 'suppose', 'be', '34', 'ugly', '34', 'still', 'beautiful', 'Helsworth', 'just', 'beautiful', 'reluctant', 'hero', 'perfection', 'am', 'being', 'partial', 'like', 'actors', 'body', 'work', 'Once', 'again', 'have', 'ability', 'be', 'minor', 'make', 'lemonade', 'lemon', 'script.Then', 'Stewart', 'T', 'call', 'actor', 'insult', 'craft', 'hated', 'Twilight', 'series', 'will', 'loathe', 'First', 'foremost', 'Twilight', 'can', 'do', 'stare', 'blank', 'expression', 'camera', 'there', '34', 'tick', '34', 'sound', 'when', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'do', 'what', 'line', 'emote', 'did', 'Twilight', 'movie', 'Perhaps', '34', 'signature', '34', 'trademark', 'whatever', 'able', 'do', '34', 'actor.', '34', 'Poor', 'Theron', 'Helmsworth', 'look', 'exhausted', 'scenes', 'are', 'Helsworth', 'fair', 'part', 'movie', 'Oh', 'forget', '34', 'extended', '34', 'version', 'too', 'long', 'especially', 'Stewart', 'watch', 'theatrical', 'version', 'instead', 'Anyway', 'back', 'Stewart', 'bashing', 'also', 'say', 'fairer', 'Theron', 'stretch', 'best', 'lie', 'least', 'Why', 'do', 'people', 'thinks', 'attractive', 'not', 'So', 'play', '34', 'fairest', '34', 'plays', 'type', 'then', 'Twilight', 'must', 'be', 'something', '20', 'year', 'old', 'boys', 'am', 'completely', 'clueless', 'answer.So', 'ending', 'great', 'movie', 'cinematography', 'standpoint', 'good', 'movie', 'like', 'work', 'Theron', 'Helmsworth', 'dreadful', 'movie', 'terms', 'script', 'pacing', 'again', 'skip', 'extended', 'version', 'as', 'far', 'Stewart', 'enough', 'said']",N/A

But then there were things about this movie that were just not so good or at least could have been much betterThe GoodThe acting: Hemsworth did exceptionally well. He was really the best thing about this entire movie. Theron did a very good job as the queen as well and the majority of the other actors (especially the dwarves) had a very good performance as well.CG: The special effects were great. From the phantom armies to the environment, this movie did a great job of portraying a mystical land full of danger and beautyEnvironment: Costumes and landscape were great. From the merky dungeons, to the ugly castles, to the dreary towns, dark forest, sanctuary, animals, everything about the environment was just great. They probably could have done a little more with the black forest but still, what they did do was great.The ok but could have been much betterBattle Scenes: So the previews led me to believe this movie would be a braveheart style movie with a heroine and in the land of mysticism. It wasn't. There were a few battle scenes that were good but most were rather boring and no where close to epic. The very last confrontation was the best and did get you into it but every battle scene leading up to it was lack luster.Story: Now the story is the story that we have all heard before. So I'm not complaining about THAT story, but really they didn't do enough with it to warrant me shelling 20 bucks for me and my wife to go sit in a theater to watch it. If you are someone that just ABSOLUTELY loves the story of Snow White then maybe you probably won't care but all the glitter and glam they added to the story, still fell short of being worth it and taking it from the old old story I've grown up hearing.The badThe acting: Kristen Stewart. I'm sorry but this was either not her movie or not her performance. I liked her in adventureland. But her acting skills either weren't strong enough for this role or she just wasn't the right match. She just fell short unfortunately.All in all it's a decent movie worth watching. Is it worth shelling out 10 bucks a person to watch? No probably not. Is it worth a buck at redbox? Definitely.

This is supposed to be a marvelous retelling of the ""Snow White"" story with twists and lots of exciting modern cinematography.  But this time without Sigourney Weaver or Julia Roberts.Charlize Theron gives a spectacular performance as the evil queen, AKA wicked stepmother.  The character is given greater depth and sympathy in this version than in any previous.  Very good work.  She is also damned sexy in this thing and will now be a permanent fixture in a certain bank.Liberty Ross is the old queen who dies and is replaced by Theron.  It's a smaller part.  But she plays is well so I put her in this.  Also going to get some bank credits.  Because wow what a hottie. As an aside, I have no idea what the hell Rupert Sanders was thinking.  Because, Dude.  Seriously.  Have you seen your wife?  Kristen Stewart?  Your wife?  Do you have a brain parasite or something?  You're like a hundred years older than that girl.Kristen Stewart is much better than I expected.  Maybe because she has about 4 lines in the whole movie.  I had thought it was kind of a vapid delivery, but Snow White was never a very brilliant character to begin with.  So, well played, I guess.The story takes place in a fantasy/mythic world that is virtually indistinguishable from that in A Boy's King Arthur, an SCA event, or a Renaissance faire.  Really.  It looks like an N.C. Wyeth illustration come to life.The first about 20 minutes of the movie are fantastic.  I found myself planning to buy the thing as soon as it comes available.  Then, just like at your garden variety ren faire, some self-impressed macho douchebag shows up and ruins everything for everybody else.In this case, the macho douchebag appears when Chris Hemsworth, playing an exceptionally 2-dimensional derivation of Hugh Jackman's Wolverine, is thrown out the window at an alehouse.  From that point I wondered if they had a walkout of directors and writers and just hired somebody's drug-addled nephew to fill in the bits that hadn't been filmed yet.  Oh, and druggie nephew sure does like CGI.Things we learn from this film:The enchanted forest from ""Legend"" is still around.  But is now extremely crowded.Medieval battles really were fought exactly like an SCA event.My better half doesn't mind if a movie is bad, as long as a muscular guy is shirtless in it.Remember when that white horse sank into the bog in ""The Neverending Story""?  They still do that.Fairies are just the monsters from ""Don't Be Afraid of the Dark"", but skinnier.A princess will remain clean and beautiful while everyone else is filthy.Be nice to magpies.CGI.  More CGI than every incarnation of ""Doom"", ""Mass Effect"", and ""Half Life"" put together.  This movie will make you want to punch anyone who works with computers right in the throat.The movie also leaves us with some unanswered questions.  Like...How the hell does a duke's son become the ultimate mega super god of archery in only about 6 years?Doesn't anybody know about puppets and animatronics anymore?When are Little People going to object to folks without dwarfism playing dwarfs in movies?  People of African descent have a thing or two to say about white actors in black face.  Native Americans aren't super keen on non-Natives playing roles like ""Indian in grocery store"".  People with actual talent object to Will Smith being rich.  Why is it okay to just have bigger actors on their knees pretending to be dwarfs?If I offer to show Kristen Stewart how to ride a horse, will she please please please learn how?  Really.  Kristen.  Come over.

I was not disappointed, but more so from the beautiful filming and special effects in the movie rather than the plot.This re-envisioning of the Snow White fairytale has the Evil Queen imprisoning her for years while she undermines and controls the kingdom.  Snow White escapes into a dark enchanted forest where just about everything is out to drug or kill you and the Queen sends out a Huntsman (a drunken man who recently lost his wife) to bring her back.  Of course, he ends up on her side and there is the love interest between them that never really materializes (will there be another movie for that?).  There's also a nobleman who knew the princess as a young girl who still has a thing for her, but that whole subplot really goes nowhere.  Maybe, they just didn't have the time for it in leading up to all of the action.  The thing that struck me as the strangest, however, was having Snow White say a Catholic prayer in one scene...since there was no other religious element in the movie save the covert pagan one of having Snow White meet the Lord of the Forest.The Evil Queen's reasons for why she sucks the life out of people and lands is explained, at the very least...making her slightly sympathetic.  Snow White is sort of an enigma, as you feel like you really don't get to know her.  Other than that, the movie is filled with small faeries that shimmer with pixie dust, the traditional troll/bridge, and (of course) the Seven Dwarves.  They are one of the best things in the movie, the most human in some ways.Overall, not a bad movie but not the best.

There is no denying that this visual extravaganza is entertaining - perhaps not for  the interminable 132 minutes, perhaps, but turn off the brain and turn on the special effects monitor and the movie has its merits. After making it through this SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN it is rather appalling to see that there is in production a Part II coming.  That bit of information deserves and OMG - why?The story as adapted by Evan Daugherty, John Lee Hancock, and Hossein Amini from the Brothers Grimm sounds rather straightforward in its altered state: Snow White, imprisoned daughter of the late king, escapes just as the Magic Mirror declares her the source of the Evil Queen's immortality. The Queen sends her men, led by a local huntsman, to bring her back. But upon her capture, the huntsman finds he's being played and turns against the Queen's men, saving Snow White in the process. Meanwhile, Snow's childhood friend, William, learns that she is alive and sets off to save her.Bad dialogue for a cast that includes Chris Hemsworth, Charlize Theron, Sam Claflin, Sam Spruell, Ian McShane , Bob Hoskins, Ray Winstone, Eddie Marsan, Toby Jones, Johnny Harris and Brian Gleeson (all fairly obscured by the lack of light and gruesome makeup) just doesn't allow this treacle of a story to get off the ground.  Add to that the flat monotone Twilight girl Kirsten Stewart as the lead and the spectacular special effects become the focal star. Despite the silly lines given Charlize Theron as Queen Ravenna she still manages to be the only character about whom we care - or even notice. This is a great way to spend a cooped in rainy evening when the other choices for On Demand are negligible. Stay awake for the special effects and you'll get you money's worth.

The movie begins slightly happy, moves into deep darkness, then into light when they take refuge in the forest, and the only thing that could improved the ending would be for Snow White to thank the families of those who'd died in the fight for their sacrifices. I like how the movie has common people who get nasty because of the dark times, but also common people like the women at the lake who seem to be maintaining a community with honour. I especially like how the movie doesn't gratuitously demonize any real-world beliefs - It seamlessly blends Christian and pagan beliefs. The movie also makes a good attempt at showing how the root of evil often lies with a warped or naive sense of justice when the Queen remembers back to the raid during her childhood and asks her brother whether she treats the people of the kingdom better than she and her brother were treated when they were young. The movie similarly creates a degree of empathy with the troll.Also, the movie doesn't create a strained plot whereby the romantic tension completely resolves by the end - It's great to see Snow White and the Huntsman look at each other from across the hall at the end, with the audience wondering both whether they're going to get together, and even whether Snow White knows that he brought her out of death with his kiss. And then there's the childhood boyfriend the Queen's avatar of whom Snow White kissed complicating her relationship with the Huntsman.This is the sort of movie that creates unanswered questions in exactly the right way, and nicely balances a lot of themes.

Kristen Stewart does an incredible job as Snow White, Academy Award winner Charlize Theron really excels as the Evil Queen and Chris Hemsworth is terrific as The Huntsman. He reminds me of Brad Pitt, only with an Australian accent. Sam Claflin is somewhat underused here, but it's okay. The story draws you in from the opening music and doesn't let go until the final credits fade. Once again, James Newton-Howard creates a rousing, stirring and heart-rending score. See this film, and if this version isn't your particular cup of tea, stick with Walt Disney Pictures' Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs & the smash hit ABC series Once Upon A Time.Now for my review of the Extended Cut of the movie.I don't have much to add to my review of the Extended Cut, other than what I said about the Theatrical Cut still stands, and the following. The Extended Cut of Snow White And The Huntsman is even better than the Theatrical Cut, in that it includes four minutes of footage not seen in theatres, and the scenes add a bit more to the story rather than slow it down. The film could have been much longer, like 2/1/2 to 3 hours, with more plot development, but the length of both versions is okay. I recommend the Extended Cut of the movie.Biblically speaking, there isn't much to be concerned about, content-wise. As is usual with any film about Snow White, there is magic involved, and it's use here is more realistic and therefore could be frightening for younger viewers. There's one improper use of Hell and one use of P-ss, but aside from that, no additional cursing and absolutely no swearing (Damned is used a few times, but in an appropriate context). The violence is a little more realistic than usually portrayed in a film about Snow White, but there is barely any blood shown (save for a few scenes). There is one scene in both versions where the Evil Queen disrobes and dips into a milk bath; however, no nudity is shown thanks to the discreet camera angle when she drops her robe and her hands are over her breasts when she's shown from the front. It's very brief, though.There IS one film about Snow White that I would absolutely caution you about viewing, as I don't know if it's reviewed on this site. The film is Snow White: A Tale Of Terror. I do NOT recommend that version of the story due to the dark & heavy violence, frightening images and a satanic ritual that takes place near the end.",5,Fantastic New Take On A Classic Fairy Tale.,1356393600,"12 25, 2012",2012,2609,"['Note', 'saw', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'few', 'months', 'XFinity', 'Demand', 'saw', 'Extended', 'Cut', 'few', 'hours', 'ago.Snow', 'White', 'Huntsman', 'unique', 'take', 'popular', 'fairy', 'tale', 'Brothers', 'Grimm', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'incredible', 'job', 'Snow', 'White', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winner', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'really', 'Evil', 'Queen', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'terrific', 'Huntsman', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'only', 'Australian', 'accent', 'Sam', 'Claflin', 'somewhat', 'underused', 'here', 'okay', 'story', 'draws', 'opening', 'music', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'final', 'credits', 'fade', 'Once', 'again', 'James', 'Newton-Howard', 'rousing', 'stirring', 'heart-rending', 'score', 'See', 'film', 'version', ""n't"", 'particular', 'cup', 'tea', 'stick', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Pictures', 'Snow', 'White', 'Seven', 'Dwarfs', 'smash', 'hit', 'ABC', 'series', 'Once', 'A', 'Time.Now', 'review', 'Extended', 'Cut', 'movie.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'add', 'review', 'Extended', 'Cut', 'other', 'what', 'said', 'Theatrical', 'Cut', 'still', 'following', 'Extended', 'Cut', 'Snow', 'White', 'Huntsman', 'even', 'better', 'Theatrical', 'Cut', 'four', 'minutes', 'footage', 'not', 'seen', 'theatres', 'scenes', 'add', 'bit', 'more', 'story', 'rather', 'slow', 'down', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'longer', '2/1/2', '3', 'hours', 'more', 'plot', 'development', 'length', 'versions', 'okay', 'recommend', 'Extended', 'Cut', 'movie.Biblically', 'speaking', ""n't"", 'much', 'be', 'concerned', 'content-wise', 'usual', 'film', 'Snow', 'White', 'magic', 'involved', 'use', 'here', 'more', 'realistic', 'therefore', 'could', 'be', 'frightening', 'younger', 'viewers', 'one', 'improper', 'use', 'Hell', 'one', 'use', 'P-ss', 'aside', 'additional', 'cursing', 'absolutely', 'swearing', 'Damned', 'used', 'few', 'times', 'appropriate', 'context', 'violence', 'little', 'more', 'realistic', 'usually', 'portrayed', 'film', 'Snow', 'White', 'barely', 'blood', 'shown', 'save', 'few', 'scenes', 'one', 'scene', 'versions', 'where', 'Evil', 'Queen', 'disrobes', 'dips', 'milk', 'bath', 'however', 'nudity', 'shown', 'thanks', 'discreet', 'camera', 'angle', 'when', 'robe', 'hands', 'are', 'breasts', 'when', 'shown', 'front', 'very', 'brief', 'one', 'film', 'Snow', 'White', 'would', 'absolutely', 'caution', 'viewing', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'reviewed', 'site', 'film', 'Snow', 'White', 'Tale', 'Terror', 'do', 'NOT', 'recommend', 'version', 'story', 'due', 'dark', 'heavy', 'violence', 'frightening', 'images', 'satanic', 'ritual', 'place', 'end']",N/A

I've avoided the Twilight saga like the cooties, and so I've missed out on the fuss and the furor about her. But I couldn't pass up on SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN like I passed up on MIRROR MIRROR, and, it turns out, I sort of fancy Stewart's performance. Skin white as snow, lips red as roses, hair black as a raven's wing. That fleshes out Kristen Stewart to a tee. Still, it's nigh impossible to trump Charlize Theron's turn as Snow White's rather... self-absorbed... step-mother. Theron simply mesmerizes. She's so good there are moments you sympathize with her - that poor, gorgeous, demented queen who as a girl was cursed by a mother's dark gift. Evil begets evil, and you sense that Ravenna must have endured some unspeakable sh--. Not that that makes up for her nasty practice of sucking the beauty and vitality out of innocent girls... Queen Ravenna is like the grim fairy tale version of Project Runway.It's a darker iteration, grittier, moodier, more full-blooded. I think the Brothers Grimm would've approved of this interpretation; it matches their gristly sensibilities more. If you've brushed up on the fairy tale, then you know the kernel of the story. SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN tweaks and embellishes on that. When the vain and vile but oh-so-beautiful witch Ravenna (Theron) murders her husband, the king, on their wedding night, it upends the kingdom, sinks it into a realm of despair and oppression. We also learn that this is only the most recent in a long series of regicides that Ravenna has committed. The king had one young daughter, Snow White, lovely and bright and pure, whom Ravenna promptly sentences to incarceration in the castle dungeons. For years Snow White languishes in wretched confinement.I don't know how I feel about how the magic mirror is presented, the film granting it the ability to metamorphose, liquid metal like, into a faceless, flowing figure that stands before Ravenna whenever she extends that one familiar question. I get that they were trying to change it up with the mirror, but then they forgot the follow-thru. so, the mirror can assume a form. And then what? And then nothing.In the story I read ages ago, the huntsman takes Snow White into the woods, at the Queen's behest, and in the woods the huntsman was tasked with carving out Snow White's lungs and liver (if I remember it right) as proof of her demise. But the huntsman demonstrates mercy and allows Snow White to flee. He instead presents to the queen the lungs and liver of a boar, and so the queen comes to believe that Snow White was indeed deaders. And so the huntsman exits the tale. But you only have to glance at the film's title to get a whiff that the huntsman (Chris Hemsworth), this time out, lands a meatier role, sticks around a bit longer.Another fashion in which this film veers away from the fairy tale we know (**coughDisneyAnimatedFilmcough**): I like that there's only a smidgen of romance, but I like that the smidge that IS there is crucial to the plot. Not to get all Twilighty, but the story does force you to choose a camp to follow: that of the surly, drunken huntsman What'shisface or Snow White's childhood pal and the Duke's dashing son, William (Sam Claflin). Note that William is a bowman who seems to rival the Avengers' Hawkeye in uncanny marksmanship. Meanwhile, I think Chris Hemsworth exhibits solid acting chops, lending tortured depth and melancholia to his huntsman. He takes a Scottish accent out for a spin, and I'm gullible enough or listened to James Doohan enough to be convinced by it. But the trailers to ABRAHAM LINCOLN: VAMPIRE HUNTER put Hemsworth's axe-work to shame.SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN flaunts a secret weapon, or rather, eight secret weapons, in the shapes of dwarves. It kinda sucks for actual dwarf actors out there, because the film employs normal-height actors who then were CG'd down to Gimli-size. But, then again, Peter Dinklage is damn busy nowadays. These contentious dwarves - as played by the likes of Ian McShane, Ray Winstone, and Nick Frost - end up stealing many scenes.It's a stunning-looking movie, or to quote my date: ""Ohhh, so pretty!"" Rupert Sanders, after a career of helming snazzy advertisements, makes his debut as a feature film director. He brings along that same eye for spectacular visuals. He lends a spooky and foreboding atmosphere to the twisted Black Forest, and it marks Snow White's abject desperation that she elects to seek dubious sanctuary within its sickly boughs. When tree branches make it a habit to transform into serpents, I tend to wonder where I left my chainsaw (sorry, tree huggers). Conversely, Sanders' depiction of the fairyland is pretty damn wondrous and speaks to that inner child still in you (yes, even you). The narrative further expands to allow for Snow's encounter (or yell-off) with a bridge troll, and, later, with a tribe of females that had committed self-mutilation rather than face the Queen's attention. The film's final action flourish consists of the almost requisite epic battle. I've gotta credit Kristen Stewart. She does have presence and she does have charisma. Or maybe those eyes suckered me in. She rolls off that hokey rousing rally speech and just about pulls it off, and that with a British accent (that, okay, occasionally strays). Still, maybe my favorite bit - and I realize I kind of pooh-poohed the romantic angle earlier - concerns the kiss that galvanizes the poisoned princess. I saw it coming, I'm sure you'll see it coming, but it was still a very strong scene. An ""Oh, yeah!"" kinda scene. Crap, there goes my mushy side. Great. Now even my date is telling me to man up.The DVD's bonus stuff:- Option to view the film in either the Theatrical version (02:07:12 hours) or the Extended Edition (02:11:30 hours)- Audio Commentary by

He is able to do humor, drama, and he even brought a tear to my eye at one point.The cinematography is amazing - it was so good so as to make Kristen Stewart seem like she was doing a good job acting (at times).The lowlights - I really wanted Kristen Stewart to convince me that despite her lethargic Twilight acting, she is amazing. Alas, she really is not. She and Hemsworth are supposed to have flames shooting between them (or at least sparks), this should have been easy since - Uh, hello it is Chris Hemsworth we're talking about here - instead she looked at him like one might look at a brother. She just did not live up to the previews or the script.As for Charlzie Theron, she cannot do a British accent to save her life and she came across as a deranged psychopath rather than a scary stepmother type. But then again that may have been what she was going for.Overall worth the watch because despite the issues that I, and other reviewers, have indicated, up until the end it's a good movie.

Theron delivers the 'Disney acting guide to being an evil queen', alternatively over-acting and screaming while preening for all the CG airbrushing shots. Stewart provides her normal mouth-open stare that's somewhere between slightly stoned and trying to find the reset button - it's hard to remember that she's supposed to be the fairest of the them all. And then there are the dwarves, a CG shortening of regular actors, that are intended to provide comic relief but come across as strange and creepy.Almost nothing in the script works very well. It starts very, very slowly, failing to build any real tension throughout, and the ending is foreshadowed so plainly from Act 1 that it couldn't have been more obvious. There are several set piece scenes that do nothing for the plot, the worst of which is a shiny fruit bowl that's supposed to be the mirror. Whereas the mirror in Shrek was a clever reworking of the Disney mirror, this mirror is like the fairy tale version of the T-1000 but without the same quality finish, and after two appearances is never mentioned again in the film. The same is true with the scene where Snow White tames a troll - after a fairly substandard fight sequence, she mysteriously becomes Snow the Troll Whisperer for absolutely no point whatsoever.Even the story logic is really dreadful. The queen's brother tells the Huntsman that the queen can't bring his dead wife back to life at *exactly* the point where he should have said nothing. The queen fears the Dead Forest at the beginning but quite happily goes there later in the film. There are creepy asexual sprites hiding in the birds for no reason at all. It's a collection of ideas that don't gel or work together to move anything forward. ** Possible spoiler ** The finale is one of the worst I can remember with Snow White killing the queen in the most banal, simplistic way with no help from any of the characters she meets throughout - after two hours of the queen showing off her 'mad spellmaking skillz', she lets an overly-armored Snow White just walk up and finish her off. I was literally screaming at the TV in disbelief when this happened!Finally, the film struggles to find a tone throughout. It's Joan of Arc meets Lord of the Rings somewhere in The Neverending Story but leaves the viewer realizing that Lord of the Rings is an incredibly well-made film and this is an excuse to extract $10. The world created here is devoid of any charm or magic and creates no lasting impression - and actually, that's not just the CG world but really the feeling I had about the whole movie. What a huge disappointment.",2,"Lord of the Rings meets Joan of Arc in this slow, poorly-plotted mess",1346630400,"09 3, 2012",2012,2713,"['170', 'million', ""'reimagining"", ""'"", 'Brothers', 'Grimm', 'classic', 'thin', 'unnecessary', 'painfully', 'slow', 'Theron', ""'Disney"", 'acting', 'guide', 'being', 'evil', 'queen', 'alternatively', 'over-acting', 'screaming', 'preening', 'CG', 'airbrushing', 'shots', 'Stewart', 'normal', 'mouth-open', 'stare', 'somewhere', 'slightly', 'stoned', 'trying', 'find', 'reset', 'button', 'hard', 'remember', 'supposed', 'be', 'fairest', 'then', 'are', 'dwarves', 'CG', 'shortening', 'regular', 'actors', 'are', 'intended', 'provide', 'comic', 'relief', 'come', 'strange', 'creepy.Almost', 'nothing', 'script', 'very', 'well', 'very', 'very', 'slowly', 'failing', 'build', 'real', 'tension', 'ending', 'foreshadowed', 'so', 'plainly', 'Act', '1', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'more', 'obvious', 'are', 'several', 'set', 'piece', 'scenes', 'do', 'nothing', 'plot', 'worst', 'shiny', 'fruit', 'bowl', 'supposed', 'be', 'mirror', 'mirror', 'Shrek', 'was', 'clever', 'reworking', 'Disney', 'mirror', 'mirror', 'fairy', 'tale', 'version', 'T-1000', 'same', 'quality', 'finish', 'two', 'appearances', 'never', 'mentioned', 'again', 'film', 'same', 'true', 'scene', 'where', 'Snow', 'White', 'troll', 'fairly', 'substandard', 'fight', 'sequence', 'mysteriously', 'Snow', 'Troll', 'Whisperer', 'absolutely', 'point', 'whatsoever.Even', 'story', 'logic', 'really', 'dreadful', 'queen', 'brother', 'Huntsman', 'queen', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'dead', 'wife', 'back', 'life', 'point', 'where', 'should', 'have', 'said', 'nothing', 'queen', 'Dead', 'Forest', 'beginning', 'quite', 'happily', 'there', 'later', 'film', 'are', 'creepy', 'asexual', 'sprites', 'hiding', 'birds', 'reason', 'collection', 'ideas', 'do', ""n't"", 'gel', 'work', 'together', 'move', 'anything', 'forward', 'Possible', 'spoiler', '**', 'finale', 'one', 'worst', 'can', 'remember', 'Snow', 'White', 'killing', 'queen', 'most', 'banal', 'simplistic', 'way', 'help', 'characters', 'two', 'hours', 'queen', 'showing', 'off', ""'mad"", 'spellmaking', 'skillz', 'overly-armored', 'Snow', 'White', 'just', 'walk', 'up', 'finish', 'off', 'was', 'literally', 'screaming', 'TV', 'disbelief', 'when', 'happened', 'Finally', 'film', 'find', 'tone', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'meets', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'somewhere', 'Neverending', 'Story', 'viewer', 'realizing', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'incredibly', 'well-made', 'film', 'excuse', 'extract', '10', 'world', 'created', 'here', 'devoid', 'charm', 'magic', 'lasting', 'impression', 'actually', 'not', 'just', 'CG', 'world', 'really', 'feeling', 'had', 'whole', 'movie', 'What', 'huge', 'disappointment']",N/A

But what I loved about this movie was Charlize Theron, could you tell? And the darkness of it. She was the shining star, resplendent in her evilness. Perhaps it was cinematography, or art direction, or props, or MS Theron herself. Delicious. There is a scene, with a bird, and a metal device and MS Theron. Nuff said. So tasty.The movie itself is actually a very nice adaptation of Snow White. It is well thought, well presented, and entertaining. Art direction and cinematography (and CGI of course) is excellent. And the main actors did a fairly good job of portraying their roles. Snow White was brave, though, I would have preferred a little more character time with her to develop empathy, which was lacking. The Joan of Arc warrior type portrayal of SW is a twist, but, not one I like particularly, since it does not jibe with the original fairy tale and Germano/Celtic legends. Part of the reason I did not develop empathy is due to the short screen time with her, though SW's portrayal is also rather flat. The huntsman was also a nice touch because he is often omitted from SW films, though prominent in some of the stories. I had much stronger empathy for the huntsman. I was distracted on a couple of occasions by accents, which were inconsistent. On the one hand, if the actors had spoken in their native accents all the time, or if the actors all used some particular accent, it would not have been distracting.On the whole though, my enjoyment factor was high, especially because of the detail in development of the darkness.It would be nice to see perhaps 20-25 more minutes squeezed in to develop Snow White herself, and perhaps her rapport with the huntsman. Don't let this deter you from renting/buying this film though. If you like authentic and historical versions of fairy tales, the feeling of old Celtic and old Germanic fairy tales/myths is very rich in this file.

Charlize Theron is the mega star actress in this movie. Even Chris Hemsworth shines as well. Kirstin Stewart is a frail manniquen as always... and she's the focal point of two feuding factions. Most of the time she's running from danger and toward the end she's caught between a wicked army and the rebels that rise against them. If only one faction were werewolf and the other vampire...It is funny how the name of the movie is Snow White and the Huntsman when it is really about the Wicked Queen / step mother of Snow White as she sends her men after Snow White. Charlize is on screen more than half the movie, which is a good thing, since she can act and even some super hero movies spend more time on the villain than the hero.The Wicked Queen searches for a way to stay magically young by absorbing the youth from fair maidens. She quickly takes over as queen after killing Snow White's father. Then she locks Snow White in a tower for a decade before the magic mirror tells her that she can stay eternally young by absorbing Snow White's youth. You'd think that would be the first soul she'd go after instead of going through the trouble to keep her for a decade... but whatever. Eventually she escapes and the queen sends her men and the Huntsman after her into an erie swamp.The sets and atmosphere stand out and someone spent a lot of time on them to make the movie feel different. This is not a happy world Snow White lives in. Everything is dead, dirty, creepy, black and wicked. There is still a happy magical setting in the middle of the movie that shines through all of the intentional ugly.

It is superbly acted with the exception of the, as usual, awful Kristen Stewart who again bitchfaces her way through a role looking as stuck-up and disinterested as she is in real life. Hemsworth is AMAZING as a man who has given up on life and finds something to fight for in the promise of restoring Snow White to the throne of her father. Charlize Theron gives depth and meaning to the character of the Evil Queen who, in this variation, married and murdered Snow White's father. The writers actually give Ravenna a post-feminist spin by making her a wronged woman whose mother is murdered by feudal lords.THERE ARE DWARVES!

A few scenes of the Queen ordering her men to kill the remaining soldiers of the army; Snow White being showed a deer carcass by the Huntsman; The Prince telling the Huntsman how much he cares about Snow White; the Queen's brother, Finn asking men who have been to The Dark Forest.I was hoping that this edition would show the scenes that were featured in the Trailer, scenes such as Snow White encountering the Troll for a second time; the Queen Screaming as the Mirror shatters; the Queen appearing young in the snow-covered forest just as she turns into ravens; Snow White standing alone on a cliff with the castle before her; the Queen walking into her bath from a different angle; the Huntsman's additional fight scenes using two axes in the forest. None of this is added into the Extended Cut--this footage isn't even listed in a Deleted Scenes Bonus.

The dark soldiers shatter like glass in battle and they were defeated by the King and his army. Ravenna (Charlize Theron) was a prisoner in a wagon held in the dark army camp and the King saw her beauty and married her. Ravenna is a witch and she kills the king to steal his kingdom. She unlocks the kingdom's gates to let her brother and his army into the city. The entire town is at war and Snow White is trapped in the city and the Queen imprisons Snow White (Kristen Stewart) in a tower.The Queen has two men hang a huge polished dish on the wall. It is a living metal mirror with magical powers. The mirror flows onto the floor and becomes a cloaked man of metal. He tells her she is the fairest of them all. The Queen absorbs the life force from other women to stay young and she wants to live forever. The Queen then has all of the people in the city slain except for Snow White.....I love movies of all types and I rarely rate them poorly but this movie was just lacking on many levels. It possibly has one of the worst scripts for a major motion picture I have ever seen. I looked it up and the movie cost over $170 million to make and you would think they would have spent more on the script. Kristen Stewart didn't say 10 words until the middle of the movie and then I wish she had kept her mouth shut. She acted stiffly and bored and like she was reading from cue cards off the set. The only saving grace for this movie was the beautiful Charlize Theron and even she could not save this film. While at times she performed her role perfectly there were other times that her character was just over the top of expected reality. I can only attribute that to poor directing.I cannot recommend it to you as a good movie. If you like Charlize Theron then you should see it but otherwise it is not a real entertaining film.

The script can't decide if Kristen is a damsel in distress or a super hero destined for greatness- examples were too numerous to label all.  But she needs the huntsman's' help, no he needs hers, she can't survive the dark forest without him, she can repel a troll with her bad breath and constipated stare, she has been locked in a dungeon with no human contact for decade plus with no military training, but plans the final assault on the evil queen with bold strategy and a speech from Braveheart.  She can lead an army but has to be &#34;saved&#34; by the huntsman's kiss (I really thought they would change this if they were going to change the story of the helpless snow white.  3.  They portray the evil queen as all powerful and she can instantly kill a man from five feet away, but Snow can defeat her?  They build up the queen for 2 hours and 5 minutes then all of a sudden she is easy to kill?  She is left virtually unguarded?  4.  Snow White's character is schizophrenic, one minute weak and pathetic, the next an excellent swordsman after a ten second lesson from the huntsman (she fights through a dozen or so guards to get to the shockingly unprotected queen.  5.  Once the dwarves are in the gatehouse, only a couple of the queen's guard come to fight them?  What?  Makes no sense.  There are many other examples.Overall, wish I would have rented it, it is fun to watch once, but the negatives are too many to want to watch again.",2,"Nice visuals, script was full of holes.",1388016000,"12 26, 2013",2013,2211,"['loved', 'idea', 'new', 'take', 'Snow', 'White', 'concept', 'awesome', 'actors', 'are', 'good', 'great', 'forgot', 'write', 'good', 'script.GOOD', 'idea', 'visually', 'stunning', 'landscape', 'decent', 'battles', 'not', 'as', 'many', 'are', 'led', 'believe', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'character', 'have', 'fun', 'unique', 'things', 'fairies-but', 'are', 'only', 'shown', 'few', 'minutes', 'Dwarves', 'are', 'cool', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'first', 'hour', 'are', 'not', 'movie', 'as', 'much', 'should', 'be.BAD', 'moves', 'slowly', 'are', 'massive', 'breaches', 'script', 'will', 'give', 'few', 'many', 'examples', 'spoilers', '1', 'Snow', 'White', 'Stewart', 'locked', 'dungeon', 'most', 'childhood', 'young', 'adulthood-yet', 'well', 'fed', 'healthy', 'articulate', 'sane', '2', 'script', 'ca', ""n't"", 'decide', 'Kristen', 'damsel', 'distress', 'super', 'hero', 'destined', 'greatness-', 'examples', 'were', 'too', 'numerous', 'label', 'huntsman', 'help', 'hers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'survive', 'dark', 'forest', 'can', 'repel', 'troll', 'bad', 'breath', 'constipated', 'stare', 'been', 'locked', 'dungeon', 'human', 'contact', 'decade', 'military', 'training', 'final', 'assault', 'evil', 'queen', 'bold', 'strategy', 'speech', 'Braveheart', 'can', 'lead', 'army', 'be', '34', 'saved', '34', 'huntsman', 'kiss', 'really', 'thought', 'would', 'change', 'were', 'going', 'change', 'story', 'helpless', 'snow', 'white', '3', 'portray', 'evil', 'queen', 'powerful', 'can', 'instantly', 'kill', 'man', 'five', 'feet', 'away', 'Snow', 'can', 'defeat', 'build', 'up', 'queen', '2', 'hours', '5', 'minutes', 'then', 'sudden', 'easy', 'kill', 'left', 'virtually', 'unguarded', '4', 'Snow', 'White', 'character', 'schizophrenic', 'one', 'minute', 'weak', 'pathetic', 'next', 'excellent', 'swordsman', 'ten', 'second', 'lesson', 'huntsman', 'dozen', 'so', 'guards', 'get', 'shockingly', 'unprotected', 'queen', '5', 'Once', 'dwarves', 'are', 'gatehouse', 'only', 'couple', 'queen', 'guard', 'come', 'fight', 'What', 'sense', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'examples.Overall', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'rented', 'fun', 'watch', 'once', 'negatives', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'want', 'watch', 'again']",N/A

Might I add that there is little less credible in the world than Kristen Stewart's armored Snow White wielding sword.Another misleading trailer.  I thought I was in for a contemporary fairy tale with epic action.  Instead I yawned my way through two hours as Kristin ""the one-look-Zoolander"" Stewart sulked her way through another over-produced, underwritten movie with an emotionally bewildered expression which begs the question did somebody just fart?  [End rant]This really ""could"" have been epic.  Many snippets, scenes and concepts/ideas were excellent; it's just that many others were not.  The opening winter scene was stark, but oh so powerful (most memorable of the movie, I'd say).  But then it was largely followed by scenes shot too close up to enjoy the storybook grandeur.  However it wasn't all bleakly shot.  Formidable castlescapes impressed and the brilliant enchanted forest reminded me that there was some serious insight behind this film's production while also breaking the lowlight gray color palate of the scenes from The Dark Forest and the dungeon-like castle.  The fairy forest was like Ferngully meets Pandora, filled with all manner of enamoring CGI flora and fauna.  Conversely, the fairies seemed like something out of a Saturday morning children's show as if they were thrown together at the last minute before the movie's release.  These are but few examples of the inconsistent quality throughout the film.I thought this would be an action/adventure movie.  But it didn't feel like one.  The chthonic troll was my favorite critter.  But the action (i.e., between the troll and the huntsman) was brief, ill-imagined and ultimately anticlimactic.  The queen's glasswork soldiers are cool early in the movie as they shatter in slo-mo on the battlefield, but the scene is all about the effects and not about the action.  During the finale, these minions are animated semi-humanoid blobs of glass shards which move so fast you can't tell what they're doing.  I wish I could unsee that scene.  In general, the action in this movie was like poor quality background noise.  It was never the focus of any one scene, but it was always too distracting to ignore.  Anyone expecting Lord of the Rings quality sword fights or man-versus-creature bouts would likely be disappointed.Really, Charlize Theron's queen made for the best moods and moments.  Her wardrobe was creatively architected to look both painfully donned and elegant while royal with trappings of the macabre.  At times her acting may come off as a bit extreme, but hey--she ""is"" playing an evil aging witch queen obsessed with youth and power.  You could feel her desperation, pain, flagging sanity...oh yeah, and evil.  The best effects were cast on the queen's sorcery as she shifts form in disguise and agonizing aging.Chris Hemsworth portrayed the right character the right way, but with the wrong lines, weak character development and no heroic scenes.  His action scenes either focus little on his character (rather the whole battle or situation) or result in him getting his butt kicked.  They also made the huntsman a depressed alcoholic widower, but offer little to justify his convenient noble transformation throughout the movie.  The dwarves, who in three minutes quickly shift from murderous rogues to stalwart allies, were really only as interesting as the actors you recognized behind the odd haircuts and facial prosthetics--namely Bob Hoskins, Ian McShane, Nick Frost and Toby Jones.  They offer little to lighten the mood, in fact often distracting from the tone with too many weak lines, frequent and ineffective attempts at comic relief, and way too much screen time. Oh, right, and the ""Prince"" guy (William) felt like a completely needless character.Stacked upon all this is that a lot of things go unexplained.  Just because you can get away with that in a kid's fairy tale doesn't mean you can do that with the adult contemporary version.  I'm complaining a lot here, but the movie isn't necessarily to be skipped.  Many of the effects and scenes would be far more enjoyable on the big screen (or at least a large HDTV) with surround sound.  Just don't make a Friday night event out of it--save it for a rainy Sunday afternoon.  A portion of these scenes, effects and ideas are why I say this movie ""could"" have been epic.  The skill set was there.  But the writing wasn't--in terms of story fluidity and dialogue, that is.  But hey, this was director Rupert Sanders' first film.  For a first job, and one of such magnitude, he showed some serious imaginative chops...he just didn't do so consistently.  Keep an eye out for him in the future.WHAT TO WATCH INSTEAD:  I'm going to go way out on a limb here and say that The Brotherhood of the Wolf (2001) accomplished what this film was trying to.  Not your style?  Then I'd wind back the clock for some nostalgic darker fantasy fun.  How about Legend (1985), Labyrinth (1986), The Dark Crystal (1982), Wizards (1977), The Last Unicorn (1982), The Whiz (1978) or Return to Oz (1985).  Too old for you?  Then why not just aim for LOTR.",3,The queen's soul-sucking aim is a bit off because Kristen Stewart is still alive and I feel like I've been drained of all vigor.,1338768000,"06 4,

I was concerned that Kristen Stewart couldn't carry this role, and I was right. While she is beautiful, her acting is simply terrible. Charlize Theron as Evil Queen was so over the top, she was bordering a cartoon. Every sentence was enunciated and dragged, it bored me to death. Romantic subplot was a pure disaster. The Huntsman was supposed to be one side of a triangle, but ended up coming across like her father rather than lover. It was very very creepy. The prince was boring and lame. I can't even remember the actors face.This film had more plot holes than a mesh sweater. I could even look pass all that if the movie was actually interesting.

Using the latest technology and a mixture of pseudo and quasi science, I have developed a formula (which literally has nothing to do with bowling) to capture the pure essence of Hollywood magic... displayed as a score ranging from 0 to 300.Snow White and The Huntsman - we own the Blu Ray, DVD, Digital Copy, and Ultraviolet ""Extended Edition""Movie Explanation (no-there is too much, let me sum up):Not your great-great-great gandfather's fairytale - retold, rebooted, reworked, re-engineered, and reimagined once for children, now for teens epic story following the harrowing tale of a depressed and moody, soon to be thrust into greatness Princess Bella, er, I mean Snow White (Kristen Stewart), as she takes flight from imprisonment by her evil stepmother, Mr. F, I mean Ravenna (Charlize Theron) and is first hunted by and then assisted by hunky axe wielding super-hero Thor, er, Eric The Huntsman, just Huntsman to his friends (Chris Hemsworth).  I would be found wanting if I didn't mention the once noble gem and precious metal miners, turned highway robbers better known as the seven dwarves lead by Black Beard himself, DBA Beith (Ian MacShane).Overall, this movie made me sad... it had real potential and was simply undone by uneven acting.  I liked the story, I liked the CGI, I liked the epic scale, heck - I even think there was some genuinely good acting.  You can read plenty of complaints about Kristen Stewart's poor performance.  The fact that she won both The Teen Choice Award aaand a Golden Raspberry is positive evidence of why we don't hold teens legally responsible and seal their records once they become adults.  If her flat, lifeless acting doesn't get you - the fact that she goes cockeyed every time she goes in for a kiss really should.  Charlize Theron helped every step of the way with her over-the-top portrayal of Ravenna, the evil stepmother.  I had to sit and ponder other reviewers positive take on Charlize and I finally had to just to realize that the writers must have forgotten a few letters when describing her as mesmerizing and operatic...  what I witnessed was indeed mesmerizing(ly bad) and (needlessly) operatic.  I saw some great acting - Sam Spruell did a wonderful job as Finn, Ravenna's brother and according to my wife, Chris Hemsworth's fancy fighting really inspired her.  She said he had the nicest ax she's seen in quite sometime (I didn't even know she liked wood chopping implements).  At the end of the day, I can forgive the casting of Stewart - hey, they are trying to cash in on Twilight fans between movies, I get that.  I cannot forgive the mistakes made by the casting and directing of Charlize Theron.  Ok movie dude - if you didn't already own it, would you buy this movie?  The answer, yes (if it was on sale).  :]What I loved:1.  It's a good reboot - the additions to the beloved fairytale were spot on and made sense2.  It's beautiful to behold - the scene with The Great White Stag was awe-inspiring to name just one3.  It was refreshing to see something other than just a comic book hero in their 12th reboot on the screen... how many times can we watch Spiderman or Superman on the screen  (if you build a better movie, they will come)4.  Gives a perfect example of why you only eat mushrooms from the grocery store and not pick your own at the park... wow, every so often I breath in a piece of lint and that's bad but nothing compared to the mushroom spores in this movieWhat I did NOT like:1.  If this is a German fairytale why is Kristen Stewart breaking in and out of an English accent thru the entire thing?2.  Did I mention Kristen Stewart?3.  Charlize Theron (did I mention Kristen Stewart?)I will be leaving more movie reviews with bowling scores so check out my other reviews.

Especially the one when the huntsman was talking to her, encouraging her or something. She looks at him like he just suddenly started speaking Japanese. It is an epic acting fail.) You could have had the best actors out there, and this would have been a failure. I think whoever was responsible for this movie just couldn't decide what they wanted it to be. Action, angst, madness? It tries all and fails miserably. Seriously, ""Mirror, Mirror"" is better than this.**************Spoilers*************My problems with the plot:***Someone needs to read ""The Top 100 Things I'd Do If I Ever Became An Evil Overlord"" (number 2 can be read as ""sewer"" instead of ventilation duct. Number 3 is especially applicable.)*****1. Why is there a nail in the wall of a castle? Anyone?2. She took him out with a scratch to the face. Come on, at least leave him with one less eye. (the whole pedobear thing was really over the top as well. We already know he's evil. don't make it too much) Why do the whole fake-seduction routine anyway? come on, she (the character) should be perfectly innocent at this time. Guile should be beyond her.3. Why tell the dupe he is being duped right at the exact moment when you shouldn't? (see suggested reading above)4. If the dark forest is so dangerous that no one comes out alive, why does EVERYONE come out alive?5. If the movie is supposed to be about ""inner beauty"", why do the women have to disfigure themselves? Because the evil queen is crazy, right? but crazy isn't reliable, so this is a logic fail.6. Why are all the queen's henchmen ok with all this? They aren't apparently getting anything out of this, the first time some real work comes around, the first thing she does is outsource it. And she can make minions out of glass, so why does she need henchmen anyway? Why did she need a ""real"" army when it's pretty hard to kill a broken piece of glass?7. Apparently her brother wants her as well. Ew[...] too much over-the-top evil. (If my brother ever tried to kiss my neck like that, he would soon be my sister)8. How come Snow White knows how to ride a horse after being locked in a tower most her life? (I'm pretty sure the first horse is a magic fairy horse, but still. And bareback even.) Or dance? Or tame trolls? (or ride in plate? or swing a sword?) And why are there fairies in the tale of Snow White? Weren't the dwarves and her ""perfection"" enough to swallow already?9. If she's been locked in a tower most her life, how do all the soldiers know to yell ""get her""? (Get who? never seen her before, is she new? What, I thought the princess was dead?) How come the whole castle knows who she is, but no one else does?10. Why, why, why , WHY the flock would you throw away your shield? WHY?!!!! If you suddenly know how to fight, you do not throw away the best thing to keep other people from using a sword on you!I'm going to stop here, or I will be writing all day!*********End spoilers************I think this movie is a perfect example that all the originality in Hollywood is dead and gone. It's the same garbage over and over, trying to squeeze a buck out of anything that doesn't run away fast enough. Plot holes you could drive a semi through, no research on the way things work (the Grey is a massacre of the natural order), physics has no hold on Hollywood... I can't think of any movies in the past couple of years that made me go ""Wow, that was flocking AWESOME!"" that didn't start out as a book or a game first*. (are TV shows done in Hollywood? Walking dead is completely engrossing. I can't get enough. {yes, WD was a comic first, but still. Spectacular acting, perfect cast, etc} Same with ""Once Upon a Time"", and ""Grimm"". Maybe Hollywood should just give everything over to whoever is responsible for awesome TV shows.)****Edit*****How did I forget ""Tucker and Dale vs Evil""?

1473511,A1ZJJWF69R31ZL,B005LAIHSG,"Kate Fredericks ""Kate""","[1, 1]","I am warning you up front, this WILL contain ****SPOILER ALERTS**** and since I don't want to stop and type it in at every point, don't read my review if you don't want spoilers about this movie.First the bad: I looked at this movie through the eyes of one who isn't a fan of any of the people in it or directing it. I couldn't honestly give it 5 stars because the story between Snow and the Huntsman and Snow's One True Love was a bit clumsy and changing a beloved fairy tale was jumping the shark (IMHO). Putting the unnecessary scenes aside (the trip to the woman's only camp? Still in the dark on the why of that one), the walk through the fairy forest and then being attacked by the evil Queen's henchmen? I don't know, maybe I'm a hopeless hopeful, but it seems to me, the fairies would have warned them it was coming, but what do I know. The fact that the Great Snow pulled together her own army after being kissed NOT by her One True Love, but the Huntsman who I'm not sure we even know who he is anyway, even to the end, where he stands at the back of the ""church"" whilst Snow is crowned ends up in a big mess. The entire ending scene was a big question mark to me. Why was it all so slow and odd? The Seven Dwarves? I didn't get that either. There were other :-O throughout the movie, but I'm tired so I'll go on to the good.I think Charlize Theron was spectacular in her role as the evil queen. She scared me to death, that's for sure. I thought the cinematography was quite wonderful throughout the entire movie. I actually thought Kristen Stewart was quite good as Snow White. In fact, I can't fault any of the actors at all. It's the STORY that was the problem. The beautiful parts intertwining with the dark parts could have been done SO MUCH BETTER. Sometimes when you mess with a storyline that works, you don't end up with something better. Had the director stuck to the actual storyline we all know and love about Snow White, with the beautiful CGI and the amazing cast he had at his disposal, I think we would have seen a 5-star movie. I wanted so badly to give this 4 stars, but in the end, there were more questions than answers, it could have been a MUCH better movie given the looks of the amount of money these producers and the director had to spend on it.This movie should have been at LEAST a 4-star movie with the support it had in cast, money and CGI - and it's so disappointing that, to me, it was quite wasted. When will these Hollywood people learn that when our world is in so much turmoil, we want to be swept away with familiar entertainment, not some new twist we have to think about? They truly need to go out and hobnob amongst the unwashed masses and ask us what we WANT if they want to stop wasting money needlessly and start making lots and lots of money again? Considering a lot of us out here are without jobs, without the ability to pay our bills, we would LOVE to have the money wasted on this movie. The money would have been better spent just sending each jobless family a check in the mail. Sorry - just my opinion. And it's not one I want to have. I WANTED this movie to be great! Quite frankly, I am being generous giving it 3 stars. Because in my heart, that's how much I wanted this movie to be great.",3,"GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY SPENT, SHOULD HAVE BEEN A 5-STAR MOVIE",1347753600,"09 16, 2012",2012,3254,"['am', 'warning', 'front', 'WILL', 'contain', '****SPOILER', 'ALERTS****', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'stop', 'type', 'point', 'do', ""n't"", 'read', 'review', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoilers', 'bad', 'looked', 'movie', 'eyes', 'one', 'who', ""n't"", 'fan', 'people', 'directing', 'could', ""n't"", 'honestly', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'story', 'Snow', 'Huntsman', 'Snow', 'One', 'True', 'Love', 'was', 'bit', 'clumsy', 'changing', 'beloved', 'fairy', 'tale', 'was', 'jumping', 'shark', 'IMHO', 'Putting', 'unnecessary', 'scenes', 'aside', 'trip', 'woman', 'only', 'camp', 'Still', 'dark', 'why', 'one', 'walk', 'fairy', 'forest', 'then', 'being', 'attacked', 'evil', 'Queen', 'henchmen', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'hopeless', 'hopeful', 'fairies', 'would', 'have', 'warned', 'was', 'coming', 'what', 'do', 'know', 'fact', 'Great', 'Snow', 'pulled', 'together', 'own', 'army', 'being', 'kissed', 'NOT', 'One', 'True', 'Love', 'Huntsman', 'who', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'even', 'know', 'who', 'anyway', 'even', 'end', 'where', 'back', 'church', 'whilst', 'Snow', 'crowned', 'up', 'big', 'mess', 'entire', 'ending', 'scene', 'was', 'big', 'question', 'mark', 'Why', 'was', 'so', 'slow', 'odd', 'Seven', 'Dwarves', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'were', 'other', '-O', 'movie', ""'m"", 'tired', ""'ll"", 'go', 'good.I', 'think', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'was', 'spectacular', 'role', 'evil', 'queen', 'scared', 'death', 'sure', 'thought', 'cinematography', 'was', 'quite', 'wonderful', 'entire', 'movie', 'actually', 'thought', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'Snow', 'White', 'fact', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fault', 'actors', 'STORY', 'was', 'problem', 'beautiful', 'parts', 'intertwining', 'dark', 'parts', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'SO', 'MUCH', 'BETTER', 'Sometimes', 'when', 'mess', 'storyline', 'do', ""n't"", 'end', 'up', 'something', 'better', 'Had', 'director', 'stuck', 'actual', 'storyline', 'know', 'love', 'Snow', 'White', 'beautiful', 'CGI', 'amazing', 'cast', 'had', 'disposal', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'seen', '5-star', 'movie', 'wanted', 'so', 'badly', 'give', '4', 'stars', 'end', 'were', 'more', 'questions', 'answers', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'MUCH', 'better', 'movie', 'given', 'looks', 'amount', 'money', 'producers', 'director', 'had', 'spend', 'it.This', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'LEAST', '4-star', 'movie', 'support', 'had', 'cast', 'money', 'CGI', 'so', 'disappointing', 'was', 'quite', 'wasted', 'When', 'will', 'Hollywood', 'people', 'learn', 'when', 'world', 'so', 'much', 'turmoil', 'want', 'be', 'swept', 'away', 'familiar', 'entertainment', 'not', 'new', 'twist', 'have', 'think', 'truly', 'need', 'go', 'out', 'hobnob', 'amongst', 'unwashed', 'masses', 'ask', 'what', 'WANT', 'want', 'stop', 'wasting', 'money', 'needlessly', 'start', 'making', 'lots', 'lots', 'money', 'again', 'Considering', 'lot', 'here', 'are', 'jobs', 'ability', 'pay', 'bills', 'would', 'LOVE', 'have', 'money', 'wasted', 'movie', 'money', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'spent', 'just', 'sending', 'jobless', 'family', 'check', 'mail', 'Sorry', 'just', 'opinion', 'not', 'one', 'want', 'have', 'WANTED', 'movie', 'be', 'great', 'Quite', 'frankly', 'am', 'being', 'generous', 'giving', '3', 'stars', 'heart', 'how', 'much', 'wanted', 'movie', 'be', 'great']",N/A

Snow is locked in a tower for years but looks like she's merely been out gardening -- some dirt smudges, newish clothes with sparkles, thin but not emaciated? And when she gets out, she's a little bit too much Sarah Connor, you know, for a young lady who has been locked up for the last ten years. And how nice of the Queen to have given Snow the jail cell with a fireplace. Also, it's Snow White -- black hair, alabaster skin?? Physically, that is just not Kristen Stewart. But that's not her fault. She just doesn't look that way and the producers/director did little to nothing to transform her into the proto-typical look of SW. Now the acting - Theron and Hemsworth are fine. In fact, I find Theron to overact in some scenes and as I watched the film, I could see why -- she was making up for Stewart. Not to drag on Kristen Stewart too much here - it's one of her best performances but it simply isn't good enough.

This flick boasts some sweet and creepy special effects like mysterious black shards that obey an evil queen and a magnificent black cloak. I jumped with surprise more than once and shuddered a bit, too, as the effects often came out of nowhere. The overall feel of the film is dark. The story is well told with some fascinating additions to/and twists on the classic tale. Plenty of battle scenes (fast, clashing action with the hyperspeed that is popular of late) and heroes give the film plenty of edge-of-the- seat action.Charlize Theron is in top form as she gives pure evil a wee bit of heart, even while she snacks on a few. This evil queen is helped in her quest for ""fairest in all the land"" (and for all eternity) by her creepy, enabling brother. Did I mention it was a dark film...not kidding about snacking on hearts. Kristen Stewart cuts the cords that bind her to Twilight and shines in several scenes. Chris Hemsworth plays a terrific anti-hero.My complaint is that the film contained a few scenes that cluttered the experience for me. I believe there was an attempt to lighten up the intensity with some frivolous good magic and whimsy. But those moments were a head-scratching distraction that took away from the story. I was willing to suspend disbelief regarding Snow White's condition after being imprisoned for years and her enchanted escape, but balked at some of the other more whimsical moments.I still consider Snow White an entertaining take on the fairy tale and I loved the effects. It's too dark for sensitive kids (and adults).

Then, within the course of what seems like a few hours, the girl is hunted down by - you guessed it - a drunk, brawling, good-for-nothing hunter who is the only one brave enough to enter the haunted forest, capture the girl, and return said girl to a wicked queen who sucks souls from young maidens in order to stay young and beautiful.Somehow the young girl convinces the drunk hunter to help her and they take off through the woods (this part is really fuzzy because I had to smoke a bowl in order to continue watching). There are some midgets dressed like the seven dwarves from the Disney version except they're all tough and grumpy and want to kill the drunk hunter (big surprise at this point).In another amazing turn of events the young girl (the same one who spent twelve of her most formative years in isolation in a tower, mind you) eventually leads an army of people and midgets and shit against the evil queen. The girl even managed to find incredibly fitted armor (complete with those little boob cup things so you know she's a chick), learn how to ride a horse, and use a sword in an incredibly short period of time after having lived the last twelve years in isolation in a tower. This is a truly gifted girl.As far as the acting goes, at least it was slightly better than the plot. Imagine a drunk Thor, a bored and aging super model/actress, and an actress who is as bad as the writing of almost all the movies she's been in. There are some cool fight scenes - sans acting, and the musical score isn't bad after a couple bowls.Overall I think watching this movie caused the death of more brain cells than anything illicit I consumed during the 128 minutes of sensory water boarding called a movie.

Obviously, the story is not going to be a surprise, so it has to be the acting that makes it interesting and she's the only one who seems to have put any effort into this.

He's eye candy, but also a fairly decent actor, so he's enjoyable to watch.  But in this he looked like one of the Geico cavemen - how did they manage to do that to Thor, for pete's sake?  So distracting, I couldn't take him seriously.And then there's Kristen Stewart, who can't act for toffee and who has such an unexpressive face that she mostly just pouts her way through the movies she's in.  The scene at the beginning of the big battle finale?  Up rides the huntsman (the love of her life, we have just discovered, no Prince Charming here) and she winces at him.  She's supposed to be bursting with joy, overflowing with love and gratitude that he is there, they will face this together, all will be well if you are with me - you get the idea - and she manages to look like the laxative has just kicked in.She's the female version of Tom Cruise - wooden acting, no depth to their performances, couldn't act their way out of a paper bag ... and yet Hollywood loves them.

She might be kinda pretty...maybe (Charlize Theron is prettier), but let's face it. She lacks something when she gets in front of the camera. This movie was no exception to that rule either. For those of you who are looking for a GOOD movie with some romance, adventure, and a little scariness, you may continue your search. Though this movie possesses those things, it certainly isn't GOOD. The worst thing about this waste of money and time was that at the end the camera zooms in on Snow White, then it zooms in on the prince, then it zooms in on the huntsman who woke her from her sleep. The music comes to a climax and the screen goes black.

1473569,A2W00XKTTF1G0Z,B005LAIHSG,"Lorenzo M. in the Hollywood CA Area ""Movie Wa...","[8, 15]","MOVIE REVIEW #35 : "" Snow White and the Huntsman ""Making his directorial debut, Rupert Saunders takes a long look at one of the very first original Grimm's Brothers fairy tales and tries hard to give it a new spin. Evan Daugherty (Killing Season), Hassien Amini (Drive, Jude) and also writer/director John Lee Hancock (The Blind Side, The Rookie) try and give the script a new modernized twist from original story. Unfortunately it moves very slowly and goes nowhere and often leaves you wondering where they are actually taking you next. I can see why this film pushed back its release date a couple times.Of course the visuals are interesting and detailed, the costumes clever and inventive and cinematography almost gothic in nature - but the bottom line - the story takes a while to become one - an actual story. There's a new spin on everything from the `magic mirror', the poison apple and even the forest animals and fairies. (Which were the most visually stimulating for the eye!)Now casting must have been a tough one, but given that she didn't have a whole lot to do (or say), Kristen Stewart (Twilight, Into The Woods) gives a somewhat subdued performance in a fairly dark film. As does Chris Hemsworth (Star Trek-2009, Thor) who is the Huntsman on a somewhat altered mission from the original tale. And, the two of them did not seem to connect - `chemically' for me.Charlize Therone (Monster. Hitchcock) plays the `evil' Witch. Now although she was extremely expressive in her desire to be evil - she wasn't looking like she enjoyed what she was doing. Bitter and spiteful and not evil for the sake of being evil, Therone didn't seem like she was having any fun with a role that didn't have to be over-the-top - but at least interesting enough to make me believe she loved and desired to do what she was doing.For me, the stand out performances came from the smaller but poignant characters - like Bob Hoskins (Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Hook)play one of the eight dwarfs who is blind. His words of wisdom and `insight' actually explain and drive the story when things actually started happening. Also, Sam Spruell (The Hurt Locker, Defiance) play the evil Witch's brother who seems to deviously delight in his quest to find Snow White after she runs into the dark forest. Fighting and re-fighting Hemsworth many times.  Both Bob and Sam are engaging to watch when they are on screen. Sam Claflin (Pirates of the Caribbean 4, Untied) played a long acquainted childhood friend of Snow's who really made a connection with his duel mission as directed by the evil Queen.Another plus for me was the representation of the Black Forest. Extremely creepy and true to the Brothers Grim original tale, the imagination of the forest attacking a person became visually scary. Also, the beauty and grace of the hidden forest, the forest animals inside this area and especially the fairies that occupied the plants, trees and animals = were quite stunning to watch. The special effects have come a long way to making the fantasy seem very real.Overall...it is a long film, that is short of moving the story along and long on fighting and action sequences of hand to hand and horse to horse combat. The relationships have a new twist to them and be prepared to get a new really big twist on this old tale at the end of the film.Definitely a family friendly film, however a little weak in the story and characterization department - I would wait for the DVD, online or rent it - Snow White didn't have the passion I was expecting.",3,Snow Needs A Little More Help - Then Just the Huntsman,1338336000,"05 30, 2012",2012,3525,"['MOVIE', 'REVIEW', '35', 'Snow', 'White', 'Huntsman', 'Making', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Rupert', 'Saunders', 'long', 'look', 'one', 'very', 'first', 'original', 'Grimm', 'Brothers', 'fairy', 'tales', 'tries', 'hard', 'give', 'new', 'spin', 'Evan', 'Daugherty', 'Killing', 'Season', 'Hassien', 'Amini', 'Drive', 'Jude', 'also', 'writer/director', 'John', 'Lee', 'Hancock', 'Blind', 'Side', 'Rookie', 'try', 'give', 'script', 'new', 'modernized', 'twist', 'original', 'story', 'very', 'slowly', 'nowhere', 'often', 'wondering', 'where', 'are', 'actually', 'taking', 'next', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'film', 'pushed', 'back', 'release', 'date', 'couple', 'times.Of', 'course', 'visuals', 'are', 'interesting', 'detailed', 'costumes', 'clever', 'inventive', 'cinematography', 'almost', 'gothic', 'nature', 'bottom', 'line', 'story', 'while', 'become', 'one', 'actual', 'story', 'new', 'spin', 'everything', 'magic', 'mirror', 'poison', 'apple', 'even', 'forest', 'animals', 'fairies', 'were', 'most', 'visually', 'stimulating', 'eye', 'Now', 'casting', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'tough', 'one', 'given', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'whole', 'lot', 'do', 'say', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'Twilight', 'Into', 'Woods', 'somewhat', 'subdued', 'performance', 'fairly', 'dark', 'film', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'Star', 'Trek-2009', 'Thor', 'who', 'Huntsman', 'somewhat', 'altered', 'mission', 'original', 'tale', 'two', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'connect', 'chemically', 'me.Charlize', 'Therone', 'Monster', 'Hitchcock', 'evil', 'Witch', 'Now', 'was', 'extremely', 'expressive', 'desire', 'be', 'evil', 'was', ""n't"", 'looking', 'enjoyed', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'Bitter', 'spiteful', 'not', 'evil', 'sake', 'being', 'evil', 'Therone', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'was', 'having', 'fun', 'role', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'over-the-top', 'least', 'interesting', 'enough', 'make', 'believe', 'loved', 'desired', 'do', 'what', 'was', 'doing.For', 'stand', 'out', 'performances', 'came', 'smaller', 'poignant', 'characters', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'Who', 'Framed', 'Roger', 'Rabbit', 'Hook', 'play', 'one', 'eight', 'dwarfs', 'who', 'blind', 'words', 'wisdom', 'insight', 'actually', 'explain', 'drive', 'story', 'when', 'things', 'actually', 'started', 'happening', 'Also', 'Sam', 'Spruell', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'Defiance', 'play', 'evil', 'Witch', 'brother', 'who', 'deviously', 'delight', 'quest', 'find', 'Snow', 'White', 'dark', 'forest', 'Fighting', 're-fighting', 'Hemsworth', 'many', 'times', 'Bob', 'Sam', 'are', 'engaging', 'watch', 'when', 'are', 'screen', 'Sam', 'Claflin', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', '4', 'Untied', 'played', 'long', 'acquainted', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Snow', 'who', 'really', 'made', 'connection', 'duel', 'mission', 'directed', 'evil', 'Queen.Another', 'plus', 'was', 'representation', 'Black', 'Forest', 'Extremely', 'creepy', 'true', 'Brothers', 'Grim', 'original', 'tale', 'imagination', 'forest', 'attacking', 'person', 'became', 'visually', 'scary', 'Also', 'beauty', 'grace', 'hidden', 'forest', 'forest', 'animals', 'area', 'especially', 'fairies', 'occupied', 'plants', 'trees', 'animals', '=', 'were', 'quite', 'stunning', 'watch', 'special', 'effects', 'have', 'come', 'long', 'way', 'making', 'fantasy', 'seem', 'very', 'real.Overall', 'long', 'film', 'short', 'moving', 'story', 'long', 'fighting', 'action', 'sequences', 'hand', 'hand', 'horse', 'horse', 'combat', 'relationships', 'have', 'new', 'twist', 'be', 'prepared', 'get', 'new', 'really', 'big', 'twist', 'old', 'tale', 'end', 'film.Definitely', 'family', 'friendly', 'film', 'however', 'little', 'weak', 'story', 'characterization', 'department', 'would', 'wait', 'DVD', 'online', 'rent', 'Snow', 'White', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'passion', 'was', 'expecting']",N/A

This review contains some limited SPOILERS.The story is of course very well known and in its main lines this film sticks to it, so there is no real need to tell it again here. However the story was changed very much as far as the character and the background of the Evil Queen (Charlize Theron) are concerned. In this film she has a name (Ravenna) and a past, of which I will say only that it is radically feminists...))) She is also much, much more powerful than in the 1937 film and even than in the original Grimm's tale. In this film she is a REALLY powerful sorceress, well versed in the darkest magic and using it massively, both to extend her already unnaturaly long life and to maintain her power over the land. But, and that was a really excellent idea, in the same time she is a poison to the land - the dark magic she uses makes the whole once flourishing country sick...Charlize Theron is THE reason for which this thing is even watchable. Her Ravenna is a really terrifying creature, feeding on life force of young maidens and rotten insides of dead birds, maintaining an incestuous relation with her own brother (&#34;Game of Thrones&#34; anybody?) when in the same time clearly hating men, using dagger, poison, hexes and legions of henchmen with same deadly skill, etc. She is a real delight to watch!Snow White was changed deeply too, from a damsel in distress awaiting her prince to a shield-maiden leading her army to war. The general idea was not so bad, but the execution of it was really not terrific... The responsability here lays both with the scenario and with Kristen Stewart's acting. I must here precise that not only I am one of the few hetero-sexual males who actually liked the &#34;Twilight&#34; saga but I also rather liked the way Kristen Stewart played Bella Swan, a troubled, clumsy, introverted teenager. The great problem is that in this film she didn't really try to portray the Upgraded Butt-kicking Fully-Armored Snow White but just... another Bella Swan. And that really hurt this film. Also let's be honest here - Kristen Stewart is not half bad looking but any magic mirror which would consider her fairer than Charlize Theron is certainly in a dire need of deep magico-psychiatrico-ophtalmological revision...)))The Huntsman also has now a bigger role in the story. Chris Hemsworth plays him here as basically a slightly downgraded Thor with some Han Solo elements. Initially there were thoughts about a sequel and therefore the Huntsman was supposed to develop feelings for Snow White and the setting for a love triangle was even established - but the total lack of any magnetism between Chris Hemsworth and Kristen Stewart is so obvious here that any possible romance between those two seem to be absolutely excluded.The dwarfs are OK I guess, with a good role of Bob Hoskins as their leader.

Sounds better right? Charlize Theron as the Evil Queen was an excellent choice. She is able to garner sympathy and show that at one time she herself was victim to another persons life-altering decision - was that her mother or neighborhood witch that initiated the curse? Honestly, I feel the movie would have been more interesting if it covered the history of the Queen and the numerous (20?) kings she overthrew. I feel that with all the cunning and intelligence that the Evil Queen had, surely, her agenda was greater than that of stealing women and taking their youth. With all the time she spent on earth, surely her persona, wisdom and goals were far greater than that. The manner in which she created a false army to appear as a beautfiul victim to seduce the King indicates how cunning she is. There is so much more with regards to direction that the industry can take with Charlize Theron as the Evil Queen.I once saw on a blog that in one of the earlier centuries, the word ""nice"" meant foolish or simpleton(?). Kristen Stewart, you look great, and apparently with her as the featured actress in this movie, the audience these days is expecting more than a pretty face who stands on a mark and appears ""nice"". At least I do. She needs to take acting lessons. What she got away with in Twilight stopped working here in this movie.  Hey, when you're at your jobs, you dont get better by people telling you how great you are and letting things slide. You dont get away on the job with your looks, its not the real world. I just feel as though someone who had more....live theater experience possibly, could have handled the part of Snow White better. Yes, Kristen Stewart is gorgeous and she has that certain something that makes you want to watch her, but sometimes, it just isnt enough.Overall, if you're interested in the Queen and watching Charlize Theron show the underlings what acting is all about, I recommend this movie.

I've read the original fairy tale, and grew up with the Disney animated version just like millions of others around the world, but this adaptation was original and compelling.  It was also much darker and more action-packed than any version I've seen before.  The little twists in the narration and plot are backed up very well within the context of the film and I found myself buying everything they fed me.Chris Hemsworth's Huntsman was a tortured man full of sorrow who finds new hope in Snow White's quest.  He used a different accent, especially when his character was drunk, than I've heard from him before, so I had little difficulty in believing him as a mortal who is NOTHING like Thor, the character who propelled the actor into worldwide stardom.Charlize Theron is brilliant as always.  Her ""evil"" queen keeps the magic alive throughout the movie since she has to use several enchantments to both keep herself young and beautiful and maintain her power.  She has her own vulnerable moments which keep her almost identifiable to the audience, but not quite.  After all, who can really identify with the wicked witch/queen?The real surprise for me was Kristen Stewart.  I avoid all things Twilight and watched her with a very critical eye.  She did an amazing job as the other title character, managing to embody the innocence and purity of her character as well as the fierce defiance that is set up in the film as one of Snow White's defining traits.

Sometimes a movie can be completely ruined by trying to take it in a new direction.  This one turned out pretty good, for the most part.It is far darker and sinister than any other version; there are parts that may give small children nightmares.  As a parent, I would be careful in showing this movie to kids younger than 10-12 years unless they are accustomed to scenes with black magic and violent combat.  The graphic scenes stop short of being gory, keeping the detailed effects of combat just out of the frame, but some of the scenes with magic being used are creepy.The story was fantastic, giving the classic Snow White tale a fresh perspective with a couple of imaginative twists.  Chris Hemsworth (the huntsman) gives a good performance, falling short in a few areas (it was too easy to imagine Thor playing the part).  Kristen Stewart is just plain awful; she's just not a good actress and there are some scenes that are so poorly acted that I had take a star off based on her performance alone.  Fortunately, Charlize Theron is ridiculously good; she steals the show whenever she's on the screen--it's hard to take your eyes off her.Overall, if you enjoy dark fantasy / fairy-tales then this movie is a good fit for you.

Her acquired accent is beyond poor. Most likely due to regional differences in the shooting locations within England, plus Scotland, and adding in Chris Hemsworth natural Australian and Charlize Theron's South African accents.

The tale focuses on themes of people who will not let go of their youth and power at the expenses of others or perhaps the lengths one will go to preserve their looks. Is this a subtle attack on plastic surgery?The images, cinematography and music are very good or better. The story, like many Hollywood films, is a few notches down and the characters and dialogue are in between the two previous mentioned elements. Charlize Theron, who plays the evil queen, does an exemplary job in presenting herself as a viable antagonist who is more than a villain in black. Kristin Stewart (best known as Bella from the controversial TWILIGHT series) plays a Messiah like Snow White, Chris Hemsworth plays an adequate Huntsman from the fairy tales and a couple of the dwarves are notable actors, too (Ian McShane and Ray Winstone).For those familiar with the Snow White legends (and if you're not where have you been?) this takes a non-Disney approach trying to make this accessible for adults especially and to a lesser extent children. I don't see much of a reason to cover the story as it's well known and all the websites are already doing it.The budget for this film was $170M and it made over $396M at the Box Office. Based on the famous fairy tale, ""Snow White"", by Brothers Grimm. A sequel was planned but got delayed when the director (who was married) slept with Stewart and got caught.This picture was nominated by the Academy Awards for Best Visual Effects and Best Costume Design.Why the hate from some reviewers?

The story started with serene winter snow-covered landscape, contrasted with red rose and three drops of red blood. Not too long, grown-up pretty Snow White walks to her mom queen with a sick bird which she pledged to look after. The moviemaker wasted no time in jumping into the tragic suffering of Snow White in the loss of her mom and her replacement with an evil queen.The replacement evil queen takes over through a metaphor in which a dark invisible army drags the irreconcilable king into unwanted war. The metaphor is quickly understood as a struggle between good and evil that transcends physical boundaries. The evil queen possesses magical powers unknown to humans which enabled her to steal young souls from girls and strong hearts from men.The witch queen represented the insatiable greed of invasion, immortality, and destruction, from which Snow White was able to escape by mere luck sent from heavens through angels, birds, horses, dwarfed bandits, and goodhearted people. In the black forest, Snow White found refuge from the huntsmen sent to capture her heart that would rejuvenate the rein of the evil queen.With the help of a traumatized huntsman and oppressed bandit of dwarfs, Snow White was able to thrive in the black forest until her union with an old friend of her father's royal fellows. Up to here, the movie was a real drama of hope, love, evil, fear, and pain. The lowest point in the movie was the speech directed by Snow White (Kristen Stewart)to her united crowd, in which her voice betrayed her stature as the king's daughter.Apparently, Kristen Stewart was a poor choice for her monumental role as the beloved king's daughter had mediocre oratorical skills. Almost every other actor in the movie performed superbly to the extent that the movie was a true showcase of bright stars, minus Kristen Stewart, who was plain, shallow, and unskilled king's daughter.The photography was truly fascinating and the film could be entertained many times.As a side note, in comparison toMirror Mirror, the two movies shared most of the landmarks of royal palaces, evil witch queen replacing a belated queen, mirror for communicating with unseen powers, king's daughter being chased out of her father's palace, bandits of dwarfs lending hands to the runaway daughter, oppressed people by evil queen, and invisible ghosts executing the queen's wishes. Yet, inMirror Mirror, the moviemaker was apparently short on talent, cash, and patience in refining the art of narrating an old fashion fictional story. Even the rope hanging of the intruders by the bandit of dwarfs was shared by the two movies, with Snow White and Huntsman riding the higher roads of exceptional moviemaking art.Mohamed F.

Oleson,"[2, 4]","Have you ever noticed how Kristen Stewart is seemingly only in movies where there are 2 guys always surrounding her (The ""Twilights,"" ""Adventureland,"" ""The Yellow Handkerchief"")?  Here she plays the titled Ms. White, the rightful heir to her father's throne, who is now imprisoned.  Dad was murdered on his wedding night (the mother of Snow died earlier) by the beautiful Ravenna (an evil, juicy Charlize Theron).  Ravenna, it appears makes use of her great beauty by marrying and eliminated various kings.  She pulls this off for many years because of a spell she received that requires her to drain the life from the kingdom's unspoiled young women.  Snow White is too young, so in the cell she goes.There are several episodes of the ""mirror mirror on the wall"" chant but this mirror isn't just an animated glass mirror.  It is gold and becomes molten (think ""Terminator 2"") and forms a humanoid shape.  This version of the Grimm classic is appropriately dark and full of filmmaker wizardry, including a colorful section of mushrooms with eyes, forest creatures and a white stag.  An obvious homage to the Walt Disney original.  While the film waffles back and forth between light and dark it also has a tendency to bog down just when it starts to get good.The battle scenes are PG-13 cool enough and Kristen Stewart is fetching in her battle armor, but the film falls short of ""Game of Thrones"" (numerous unintended comparisons) in style and substance.  After about 8 years of imprisonment the now a young woman, Snow White manages to escape and enters the dark forest ultimately engaging a would-be hunter (Chris Hemsworth) and a childhood friend (Sam Claflin) as fellow combatants in an effort to dethrone the evil queen.  To the filmmaker's credit, Snow doesn't spend any time thinking of romance with either of the hunks longing for her favors.  She's obviously too busy planning the overthrow.  So who's the fairest of them all?

Gregg,"[0, 1]","CONSSomebody wasn't very good about the details in this movie - young snow white had medium brown hair instead of ""hair as dark as a raven"" (and you see this RIGHT after the narrator is saying her description) and on top of that, instead of ""skin as white as snow"" she had freckles!  And they don't even make her lips red. The older snow white does have dark hair but they still didn't redden her lips - went with a more natural rosy mauve.Much to my surprise, the online picture quality for some reason was not very good (might have to buy a BR-DVD disk instead of watching this online).PROS:Good special effects - the evil queen has some pretty awesome powersCharlize Theron gives an excellent performance as the evil queen in this, and Kristen Stewart (SW) and Chris Hemsworth (the huntsman) are good too.It was a little long but I enjoyed this and absolutely recommend.======STORY:Queen finds a rose in the winter, goes to pluck it and instead is pricked.  Some of her blood falls on the white snow and she decides it looks so pretty and hopes that if she has a daughter that her skin is white as snow, with lips as red as blood, hair dark as a ravens wings (the queen herself has black hair and fair skin), and that her daughter has the strength of that rose she couldn't pluck.  Later on she is blessed with a beautiful daughter like this.  Perhaps 7-8 years later the queen dies (doesn't say of what) and a ""dark"" foe draws the king into battle.  When they are killed, these soldiers break into dark shards - they are clearly not natural.  When the battle is over the king finds what appears to be a prisoner of the foe, all chained up and dirty like a prisoner - but she is beautiful and he marries her immediately.  On their wedding night she reveals her hatred for men and kills him and lets in her brother and her real army and they take over the kingdom.  Snow White (SW) tries to escape and ends up being locked in the north tower (as her blood/life may be useful to this dark queen at some point.)  And the land of the kingdom suffers under of evil and neglect (so everything appears to be covered with ash/soot or is mud, the plants all dead.One day an attempt is made on the evil queens life and when she uses her magic to kill the would-be murderer it drains her beauty and her powers.  And on this day the mirror tells the queen that SW is surpassing her beauty and becoming the fairest of the land (which threatens her powers) but if she takes her heart she will never again weaken or age -  basic immortality.The evil queen sends her brother to fetch SWs heart. SW manages to wound him and escapes into the dark forest - where the queen has no powers.  She promises a huntsman that if he brings her SW, she can give him back his beloved deceased wife with her powers.

1473678,A14SRB2VNHKO3J,B005LAIHSG,"Nikki Kasakitis ""Nikki @ Foil the Plot""","[4, 7]","Let's take a moment to re-imagine the classic fairy tale, Snow White, as something other than the whimsical version we all know. The story remains much the same-- A noble King and Queen give birth to a lovely daughter (Snow White). Shortly thereafter the Queen dies, and in all his grief, our King takes on a beautiful new bride. Little does the King know this will be his undoing, for his new wife, Ravenna, is an evil, man-hating sorceress. Soon the King is dead, Snow White is imprisoned and our quiet kingdom plunged into darkness and despair. With a little bit of ""Mirror, mirror on the wall"" action, Ravenna learns just how much her and Snow White's fates are intertwined. Snow will bring about Ravenna's destruction or she'll bring her total immortality. Naturally, you can guess which option Ravenna prefers. But in this version of the tale, Snow isn't as helpless as her Disney counterpart. She manages to escape her cell and goes on the run through the big, bad forest. Ravenna is mad, like steaming mad, so she enlists the dashing (but drunk) Huntsman to capture our much revered, Snow. During their epic journey, both the Huntsman and Snow White discover the grandeur of the destiny they're bound to fulfill and learn just how much they need one another.In a world full of reboots, it's hard to keep a fresh perspective but Rupert Sanders somehow managed to pull it off in Snow White and the Huntsman. He's turned this familiar tale into a medieval epic adventure and made our seemingly docile heroine a total warrior. He has a distinctive and original directing style and its quick-cut nature works with the story he's decided to tell. I like what Sanders has done here and it works given the darker nature of the source material. The original Grimm story was not a happy one--it was dark and foreboding and, well, grim. I like that he wasn't afraid to take it to a darker place and he did so without losing the magic and whimsy of Disney's version. There are still dwarves and magic mirrors and poisoned apples and they all fit naturally in their own way. Without a doubt, this is the type of movie you want to watch in a movie theatre. But stunning as the cinematography is, the film does have its weaknesses.I guess my main beef is the fact that the character development is somewhat lacking. We're given interesting back-story on Ravenna and Snow and the Huntsman and not nearly enough time to take it all in. It's enough to want to know more but not enough to satisfy. This causes the story to feel somewhat rushed and underdeveloped. It's like we're given the Sparknotes version of the story, not the whole thing. One of the movie's stronger elements was the great cast. What more could you want out of a movie featuring the likes of Charlize Theron, Chris Hemsworth and Kristen Stewart? Okay, majority of the cast is strong--I admit, I'm not a big fan of Stewart. I feel like she plays the same wide-eyed, mumbling girl in every movie she's in. She barely registers any kind of emotion and when she does, it's virtually indistinguishable from any other emotion. For example, there's a moment when she turns from a panic-stricken princess into a strong soldier, but it was laughable. No offense Kristen, but I just don't get the cut of your jib, if you know what I'm saying.Theron as the Queen Ravenna, on the other hand, she made that movie. Every time she came on screen, I just couldn't tear my eyes away. Not only was she absolutely stunning, she was utterly terrifying. I feared for the lives of everyone she came into contact with. She brought evil to a whole new level and it was frightening. Then there's Hemsworth who is certainly talented enough but his character was overshadowed by the phenomenal performances of Theron and the bumbling of Stewart. I don't think he was given enough of a chance to shine on his own. And the chemistry between him and Stewart felt too forced, I just wasn't buying their love story. Where the main cast was lacking in chemistry, the supporting cast certainly succeeded. With the talents of Bob Hoskins, Ray Winstone, Nick Frost and Sam Spruell it's hard to go wrong. They own the screen and some of the movie's better moments are thanks to them. Despite its set-backs, I think Sanders has crafted a beautiful and strong retelling of Snow White. Overall, I think the Grimm brothers would be proud.Food for Thought: As Sanders' debut film, Snow White and the Huntsman is quite strong. It's full of action, adventure, drama with even a touch of comedy--all the things you want in a summer blockbuster. In the same vane as the original Grimm fairy tale, we see Snow White in a darker light which makes the heroine's arc that much more powerful. Well, at least it would if you actually cared for the heroine but this was one movie where I was rooting for the villain instead. A visually impressive film, it's one that's worth the money despite Stewart's relatively bland performance as Snow.Rating: 3.5/5 stars",3,Not Your Average Fairy Tale,1347494400,"09 13,

How he landed some big names (Chris Hemsworth, Ian McShane, Kristen Stewart *ahem*) on his first film, I don't know. Something else that brought large attention to this curious collaboration was the good marketing. I didn't expect such a new director to have such a large impact the first time 'round. That was done well.Despite the luring marketing, there were several problems with it once I actually saw the movie. There are various scenes in the trailers that never appeared in the movie (unless they will come in future editions or alternate endings). Also, it was falsely commended for having amazing, cinematic battle scenes. However, the reality is that the battles (save one or two) didn't live up to the cute title acronym (SWATH). They were very mediocre, compared to others from medieval movies.While most battle scenes were not choreographed uniquely enough, the filming angles and cinematography were tasteful. Some scenes went so far as to make me beg for 3D, but there weren't enough to warrant the ""upgrade."" The CGI was amazing with the animals, fairies, troll, and shard soldiers. Now, the costume designers made a name for themselves. From the Huntsman to Gus, each costume was well-thought and gave each character good context.Speaking of character, there were several golden eggs. Hemsworth, for example, proves his worth once again as the Huntsman, layering grief from his wife's death with his tired, unmotivated way of battle, until Snow White rekindles his hope in something beyond the black reign of Ravenna. Kristen Stewart's acting performance, however, closely resembles the previous sentence: long and eventually boring. She seems to tell rather than show, in many circumstances. While she certainly is pale, I believe Sanders would be better off having chosen a different heroine. (Hailee Steinfeld, who's proven wrong those concerned with her age, or, dare I say it, Saiorse Ronan, maybe? She'd look good in black hair)While this is definitely not the style of Tim Burton, I still wouldn't recommend taking children to see this. There are several disturbing scenes near the beginning, regarding the Queen stealing beauty. There is likewise a lot of battle violence throughout the movie, and that is not good for young eyes. The Queen disrobes twice, showing only her upper back, so be warned.Because of the 2D, and Kristen Stewart's performance, I'd say you won't miss much if you wait until it comes to dvd.

Both are outstanding actors portraying complex, interesting characters--but their talents are wasted here.

King Magnus, widowed and in lonely pain, rescues a beautiful woman named Ravenna who is held prisoner by a supernatural army. He brings her back to his castle. Played by Charlize Theron, the viewer can sense that Ravenna is not as she seems. Snow White, the king's daughter senses this from the start. Ravenna cleans up real good, seduces the king, marries him and kills him on their wedding night. Ravenna and her army take over the kingdom and imprison the young Snow White in the tower.'Snow White and the Huntsman' is a decent film even though much of the middle and end of the film feels somewhat forced.

It's dark and relentless and amazing.I had heard such bad things about it, and about Kristen Stewart, that I had low expectations.I am happy to report that they, and I, were wrong.It's great.First, Kristen Stewart is fine.  I had only seen her in one film, Panic Room, and there she was a child and the role didn't require much.  But here she is good.  She registers a whole panoply of emotions from dread to ferocity to doubt to panic to despair to budding confidence to confusion to remorse to awe.  Most surprising, she shows herself to be a great physical actor: her lunges and slides and tumbles are really good.Charlize Theron is good, too.  After her horrid sleepwalking performance in Prometheus, I thought she had lost it.  Not so.  Here she is perfect.  She even overacts, which is precisely right for the role.Chris Hemsworth is wonderful.  He's not just a hunk; he can act.  Even do humor.And the Seven Dwarfs are amazing.  I could hardly believe my eyes.  Ray Winstone???!!!  Eddie Marsan???!!!  And Bob Hoskins??????????!!!!!  Terrific.  I don't know how they made these guys into dwarves, but they are spectacular.And the whole look of the movie is great.  Grueling and dark most of the time, then flowering into brightness in the land of the fairies, and glimmering toward the end.  All of this is thematic, of course.  The struggle of the Good Earth Mother/Life Force (Snow White) against the Evil Earth Mother/Vampire Force (Ravenna), bringing the earth back to life after a long period of death.And the bird-theme is brilliant.All in all a wonderful movie.

So with the small amount of character development seen on the screen, it is really unimpressive when she decides to adorn herself with armor and fight the extremely believable and excellently portrayed Evil Queen. Perhaps the director and writers depended too heavily upon the audience's knowledge of this fairy tale and therefore chose to develop the often unseen evil characters, such as the dark forest, troll, Queen and her army so even when good wins in the end, you are left with only the dark imagery and a new-found respect for the queen rather than a love for good and Snow White.  At the same time, I applaud their respect for the fable and that although they alluded to a love affair between SW and the Huntsman, it leaves it to your imagination on the ending and doesn't upset true fans of the SW storyline who don't want to see any extreme storyline changes.  Another excellent and overlooked aspect of the film is the incredible CG work in the fairy garden, and on the dwarfs.Additionally I thought it worth noting that the casting of Kristen Stewart did little to add or detract from the movie as she really is a sub-sub-character.

In my opinion there are some ridiculous scenes that come out of no-where. POSSIBLE SPOILER- BUT I DON'T THINK SO: I WILL JUST MENTION A SCENE OR TWO--The most preposterous being when snow white is trying to escape and ends up on the beach where there just happens to be a gorgeous healthy white horse sitting by the water. Of course she rides it full tilt to escape the posse. Snow herself most of the time is in full make up with long fake eyelashes (a close up in the forest reveals the eye lashes) This is after 10 years in prison and weeks in the dark forest and trudging through city sewers.Although the direction and flow was poor, the acting was very good from the cast. At times a tad over-acting from Snow white with her riling up the troops speech and the queen, who I thought would collapse from stress and anger in her dialogue; but all in all pretty good.Not to give any more of the movie away, there are several other inconsistencies in the film from beginning to end. I was not impressed. It is also overly long and clocks in at over two hours. This would have been a fun ""after school special"" like you would watch in the old days of TV. A teleplay with some nice visuals and decent acting...but nothing that you would want to see again and should have been about 60 minutes long. (with commercials)  I would suggest a rent only. We streamed it on Amazon for the cost of a large Mocha Frappachino (sp). I regret not getting the Frap instead. I would have saved 2+ hours.

And to add to the excitement, the main premise of the film that involves the classic fairytale character Snow White (Kristen Stewart) and a slightly different band of seven dwarves.  Along with Snow White, the Huntsman (Chris Hemsworth), who was called to capture Snow White and return her to Ravenna (Charlize Theron), the evil queen who is on the never ending quest for immortality; she preys on unsuspecting individuals and literally breathes the life out of them in order for her to maintain her youthful beauty.  However, Ravenna appears to possess vanity to the extreme, especially as she seeks guidance from Mirror Man (Christopher Obi).  Director Rupert Sanders adds an enormous twist from the original classic fairytale but not without subtly maintaining elements in the film that viewers will most likely identify.The title of the film may reveal much about the story of Snow White but diverts from the original story as well as the Disney film.  If viewers thought the Disney classic was dark and scary, especially as a child, one may see this adaptation rather more similar to the ""Harry Potter"" meets ""Lord of the Rings"" with a slight dabble of special effects on the ""Terminator"" side; it is the special effects and the cinematography that help to emphasize the dramatic and darker scenes in the film.  But in between the darker shades, there are lighter shades but rather brief when Snow White escapes the dark forest and encounters the seven dwarves terrain.  However, if one is looking for a classic song of ""high ho"" or birds singing along with Stewart, they will be disappointed; there are fairies and a deer-like creature that offers a hopeful moment for Snow White that is quite reminiscent of the Narnia films.  But the conflict ensues once more when Ravenna's brother Finn (Sam Spruell) and her henchman Aldan (Joey Ansah) wreak havoc and start a battle of flying arrows through the forest.  The film contains several battle scenes, but the most intense scene is the ultimate battle between good and evil, Snow White in her somewhat Joan of Arc regalia and Ravenna as a ""black swan.""But as viewers will see with a story involving good versus evil, it is undeniable of what side will prevail.  Snow White and the Huntsman is a riveting film that may have viewers at the edge of their seat because although one may already know about the story of Snow White, this adaptation has unpredictable and surprising moments.

Unfortunately, the lack of a good script, terrible acting from Kristen Stewart, and funky, creepy dwarfs ruined it. There was no chemistry between Snow White and the huntsman - the characterization was glazed over at best. We're told Snow could inspire people to follow her, but why? Kristen Stewart does her usual fly-catching, mouth-open, blank-eyed gawping about - nothing about her portrayal of the character would inspire anyone to do anything but find something else to watch. I didn't expect or want silly dwarfs, but these guys were just dirty and creepy and weird, like little pedos. The huntsman had the most potential to be an interesting character, but his dialogue quickly ran out of steam. The evil queen and her brother were the best characters, but not enough to pull this stinker out of the hole.

Out of the cast the ones who gave the best emotional portrayal of their characters would be the evil queen and the huntsman if they gave much less screen time to the talentless Stewart I would have been much happier but since Stewart is riding the coattails of the Twilight success(Thanks to teenage girls) we're forced to hear her awful emotionless dialogue throughout the movie as well lack of any emotion on her stoic face throughout the movie think a female version of Keanu Reeves.

This is NOT a retelling of the old fairy tale we all know from childhood.It is much darker and more violent,thus should not be viewed by persons under 14.Having that said,the film is a visual treat,but I found the going just a little slow until Snow White escapes her imprisonment and starts her long road back to restore the kingdom of her father with the help of the Huntsman.The story finds a young Snow White without a mother,soon into the film.Later that day the King`s troops fight against a dark force of men,not of this world,as they disintegrate upon being struck.In the middle of this dark force is a barred wagon in which the King and his men find a beautiful woman,chained(Theron).The very next day she becomes wed to the King.In their bed that night she kills the King and instantly becomes Queen.The King's loyal subjects fight but it is no use and some,including a young boy friend of Snow White,William,flee the castle.Snow White herself is imprisoned in one of the castle towers for years as the Queen and her brother rule the Kingdom.When Snow White becomes of age she finally manages to escape her captors and flees into the countryside.Guided by two birds she is led to a white horse which carries her far into a swamp,but is bogged down and can go no farther.The princess flees farther into the swamp/bog/forest where she finally collapses.Back at the castle a Hunstman is hired by the Queen to find the escaped princess.He tracks her down in short order,but something prevents him from releasing her to the Queen's brother.Instead he becomes her protector and they flee ever farther through the bogs and swamps and into the forest.It is there the Hunstman finally realizes who it is he is protecting,and they meet up with a band of dwarves,who pledge their allegiance to the princess.In the meantime the princess's girlhood friend William,finds out she is still alive,and incognito,joins the Queen's brother and his men in the search for the princess.Back with the dwarves the princess and the Huntsman travel through an enchanted fairy forest where the princess comes face to face with a white reindeer with huge antlers.None of the dwarves have ever viewed this sight,and as the animal blesses the princess,an arrow flies straight into the reindeer,killing it.Some of the Queen's men have found them.In the ensuing battle revenge is made but one of the dwarves dies.The next morning the princess and William take a walk in the woods,talking.When the princess takes a bite out of an apple William gave her,she slips into a coma.The Queen has poisoned her and changes back into her normal body.The others come to her rescue but it is too late.William kisses her goodbye and she is taken to his fathers castle.There William instigates the men to up-rise and fight against the evil that rules the land.Before they ride the Huntsman visits the princess and also kisses her.After he leaves the princess slowly comes back to life and joins the troops outside.She inspires the men to fight alongside her and take back what is rightfully theirs.A long and protracted battle takes place as the troops face many obstacles just to get into the castle.Once in,the princess inches her way along and travels the long and windy stairs to the Queens room.The two battle for supremacy.The princess is outclassed most of the way until,just as the Queen has her down and is about to take her heart,she quickly stabs the Queen in Her heart and kills her.The film ends as the princess,now Queen,finally reigns over the restored Kingdom.Within the first part of the film that I earlier referenced that was slow in the building,there occurred some noticeable faux pauxs.When the princess finally escapes her room and locks the Queens brother in,we see her fleeing in one moment and then brother is suddenly in pursuit of her(how did he get out so quickly).Another such scene involves her escape to the outside of the castle walls through sewers and by jumping into the ocean.She finally comes upon a white horse and finally after all that time,the Queens troops are suddenly hot on her trail.And I watched the scar that the princess gave the Queens brother with a nail,come and go and change more than a few times.The editors weren't watching what they were doing.The film finally picks up after this as the princess escapes through the swamp/bog and meets up with the Hunstman.I actually became more emotionally involved at this point,which hadn't been the case up to this point.From here on the film builds upon itself and the inclusion of the dwarves was nice,as was the CGI involved to make normal men that size.The make up and wardrobe people are to be commended here for a job well done;with the changes in costumes and make up(Theron especially)from scene to scene,in some cases,it must have been a daunting task all around.The acting is generally solid,except for the very person the film revolves around Kristen Stewart.I thought she lacked the believability to convince me she had that all-so important inner strength that would propel her to become a Queen on her own.This I think is another reason the film was so slow to get off of the mark.Her credibility improved with the Hunstman on the scene,but he really just masked her deficiencies.Technically speaking this DVD contains both the theatrical and extended versions of the film in their original w/s a/r of 2:35:1.The only extras are commentary and a featurette.All in all,once you get past the slow start,this film starts to pick up quite well.The cast is a solid one,excepting the princess Stewart,who needs some improved acting chops and who was carried a good portion of the way by her co-stars.This is not a fairy tale for the small fry as it is violent and scary.3

1473768,A21VR7M8O55EF6,B005LAIHSG,Robin Friedman,"[9, 13]","In ""Snow White and the Huntsman"", first-time director Rupert Sanders offers a new, less than successful interpretation of the Brothers Grimm's timeless fairy tale. There are some things I enjoyed in the movie. The scenery in Pembrokshire and Marloes Sands, Wales, is lonely, rugged and spectacular. Much of the film takes place in a frightening place called the Dark Forest replete with snakes, gnarled trees, out of the way paths and strange creatures. It is a good setting in its own right as the huntsman leads Snow White through its treacherous maze. And the movie offers long scenes of crystalline yet forbidding lakes.Kristen Stewart stars as the heroine while Charlize Theron overacts as the extrarordinarily wicked Queen Ravenna. In this version of the story, Snow White has two suitors: Eric,portrayed by Chris Hemsworth, a rugged huntsman grieving over the death of his wife, and the aristocrat William, Snow White's childhood friend, played by Sam Claffin, who is in rebellion against the wicked, usurping queen. The acting is acceptable if sometimes stilted. The dialogue frequently is commonplace.The movie changes the usual telling by deemphasizing love and romance and making Snow White a active independent person in her own right. In the traditional tale, Snow White sleeps and much of the action focuses on the eccentric, affectionate Seven Dwarfs.  In this story the Dwarfs are eccentric indeed but they are a mean group, won over to the princess with difficulty.  There is an apple and an awakening kiss but little is made of it. Instead, Snow White becomes a Joan of Arc figure and leads an attack, shown in great detail, on Queen Ravenna and her well-fortified and defended castle. Love and romance get downplayed, as Snow White becomes an independent, strong willed, benevolent, and self-sufficient ruler without a man at her side.Plotting and pacing are major issues with ""Snow White and the Huntsman"". At over two hours in length the movie drags.  There are too many characters and special effects which, while frequently interesting in themselves, take away from the story. The story line is unduly tangled and difficult to follow with its many distractions. Romance is pushed aside in a way that does not improve or modernize the old tale.  There are magic mirrors, attack birds, shards of glass, strange creatures, lots of violence and a coming of age for the heroine. But the movie is gimmicky and lacks cohesion, timing, and tension.There are some interesting things in this movie, but it fails to enhance its classic story.Total Time: 126 minutesRobin Friedman",3,Not the Disney Snow White,1338768000,"06 4, 2012",2012,2591,"['Snow', 'White', 'Huntsman', 'first-time', 'director', 'Rupert', 'Sanders', 'new', 'less', 'successful', 'interpretation', 'Brothers', 'Grimm', 'timeless', 'fairy', 'tale', 'are', 'things', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'scenery', 'Pembrokshire', 'Marloes', 'Sands', 'Wales', 'lonely', 'rugged', 'spectacular', 'Much', 'film', 'place', 'frightening', 'place', 'called', 'Dark', 'Forest', 'replete', 'snakes', 'gnarled', 'trees', 'way', 'paths', 'strange', 'creatures', 'good', 'setting', 'own', 'right', 'huntsman', 'Snow', 'White', 'treacherous', 'maze', 'movie', 'long', 'scenes', 'crystalline', 'yet', 'forbidding', 'lakes.Kristen', 'Stewart', 'heroine', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'extrarordinarily', 'wicked', 'Queen', 'Ravenna', 'version', 'story', 'Snow', 'White', 'two', 'suitors', 'Eric', 'portrayed', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'rugged', 'huntsman', 'grieving', 'death', 'wife', 'aristocrat', 'William', 'Snow', 'White', 'childhood', 'friend', 'played', 'Sam', 'Claffin', 'who', 'rebellion', 'wicked', 'usurping', 'queen', 'acting', 'acceptable', 'sometimes', 'stilted', 'dialogue', 'frequently', 'commonplace.The', 'movie', 'usual', 'telling', 'deemphasizing', 'love', 'romance', 'making', 'Snow', 'White', 'active', 'independent', 'person', 'own', 'right', 'traditional', 'tale', 'Snow', 'White', 'sleeps', 'much', 'action', 'eccentric', 'affectionate', 'Seven', 'Dwarfs', 'story', 'Dwarfs', 'are', 'eccentric', 'indeed', 'are', 'mean', 'group', 'won', 'princess', 'difficulty', 'apple', 'awakening', 'kiss', 'little', 'made', 'Instead', 'Snow', 'White', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'figure', 'attack', 'shown', 'great', 'detail', 'Queen', 'Ravenna', 'well-fortified', 'defended', 'castle', 'Love', 'romance', 'get', 'downplayed', 'Snow', 'White', 'independent', 'strong', 'willed', 'benevolent', 'self-sufficient', 'ruler', 'man', 'side.Plotting', 'pacing', 'are', 'major', 'issues', 'Snow', 'White', 'Huntsman', 'two', 'hours', 'length', 'movie', 'drags', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'special', 'effects', 'frequently', 'interesting', 'take', 'away', 'story', 'story', 'line', 'unduly', 'tangled', 'difficult', 'follow', 'many', 'distractions', 'Romance', 'pushed', 'aside', 'way', 'not', 'improve', 'modernize', 'old', 'tale', 'are', 'magic', 'mirrors', 'attack', 'birds', 'shards', 'glass', 'strange', 'creatures', 'lots', 'violence', 'coming', 'age', 'heroine', 'movie', 'gimmicky', 'cohesion', 'timing', 'are', 'interesting', 'things', 'movie', 'enhance', 'classic', 'story.Total', 'Time', '126', 'minutesRobin', 'Friedman']",N/A

The production is well mounted, and money has been spent on this.  The script is serviceable, a bit awkward in terms of language in a couple of spots.  The film's main problem is it is WAY TOO LONG.  An hour or more could easily have been cut without losing any sense of story.

Snow White gets to don about 3 costumes throughout the movie, while I couldn't keep up with Queen Ravenna's dazzling wardrobe collection.I've noted that until the time Snow White is about to be summoned to be killed, the Queen must have had provided excellent dental care and a cosmetic consultant to attend to Snow White even though the latter was locked up in a tower. Snow White had all the time in the world to wax and shape her pristine eyebrows! She has nice curled eyelashes too. Wow! You didn't think I'll miss that, did you? Snow White has polished finger-nails, all cut, prim and proper, no long nails despite her years in jail. Good hygiene there! Oh, at least, the movie makeup artists did try to fill in some dirt on the sides of her finger-nails! Ha ha!What I like about about this movie:(1) Everything about actress Charlize Theron! She's hot!(2) Kristen Stewart's hot too and plays Snow White well!Kristen Stewart's acting has improved tremendously since that boring""Twilight"" series! Then again, Kristen is naturally sexy, all the camerasneeded to do was zoom in on her pretty face. Nothing more needs to be said!(3) Luxurious costumes, especially the Queen's!(4) Captivating background scenes.(5) Good graphics.What I don't like about this movie:(1) That comical kissing scene between the Huntsman (played by actor ChrisHemsworth) and the dead Snow White (played by Kristen Stewart). In thisscene, the Huntsman said something like ""you remind me of my wife"".... Ialmost burst out laughing in the cinema! He could very well be saying:""Little Snow White, you look like my little sister! Let's just hope you don'ttransmit any cold sores or viruses from remnants of that poison apple when Ikiss you on your lips!""(2) lack of sufficient battle scenes.(3) cheesy and unrealistic battle scenes: eg. King Magnus hastily charginginto the battle formation of Queen Ravenna's phantom troops.

1473826,A1W9JB3KRSDEQD,B005LAIHSG,"singer ""mg""","[0, 0]","The original Snow White was a story told to relate the difference between innate and physical beauty in a woman. Kristen Stewart, though fairly good as the princess avenging her family and her kingdom from evil, misses one important element that makes Snow White who she is and that's joy. The whole weight of Snow White's beauty doesn't rest with her innocence or pretty face but with her inner joy, love of life and compassion. Stewart doesn't bring these elements to the role but remains dour through the entire film. The strength of a Snow White is that she can inspire love from all around her because she carries that happy lightness of being within, the fairy tale itself rests on the idea that a woman's beauty is in her innate qualities and attitude not her physical beauty; in short women cannot command love just because they are physically attractive. By contrast the performance of Charlize Theron as the queen is awesome. Theron balances everything perfectly and subtly portrays what drives the queens character. The queen symbolizes a woman who cannot love and so cannot be loved because of some grave hurt that has twisted her heart and her character, she's supposed to hate Snow White not just because she's pretty but because she's happy and loved. Theron shows a woman who is dependent on the power of physical beauty because she cannot exude it from inside. She feels used, hurt, lonely, angry and vengeful the opposite qualities that makes Snow White snow white which is why she's told by her magic mirror that if she takes the princesses heart she will live and remain beautiful forever.

She is the only reason I enjoy the Twilight films and I figured there would be a similar effect in Snow White. Having seen it three times now, I can definitely say that she is not the only draw, and is also not the only enjoyable thing about the film. Snow White & the Huntsman sets out to be this sweeping, big-budget action/fantasy epic with a grandiose story (and soundtrack). It only partially succeeds, but what's there is still (to me) an enjoyable experience.The main problem the film suffers from is a lack of consistent pacing and tone. There are many important scenes which drive the emotional bond between characters, whether it's between Snow White, the dwarves, Chris Hemsworth's Huntsman, or a combination of the three. These scenes are done well, but the transitions between them and the action sequences in the film are often messy. We are often jolted from action to emotion in weird and awkward ways at times, and it disrupts the natural flow. Still, the final product is worthwhile and still succeeds (through fantastic performances from its stars, most notably Charlize Theron) even as it suffers from weak transitions and pacing.The audio quality and picture quality are fantastic, and the set comes with a number of interesting extras that really delve into the production and costume design for the film, as well as the thought process behind bringing a darker, grittier version of the Snow White fairytale to the screen.As it stands, Snow White and the Huntsman is a missed opportunity for what could have been a genuine summer blockbuster. However it is still worth a watch and the blu-ray boasts excellent audio and picture quality, as well as a healthy dose of extras.

1473844,A1RVBEAD8RKDT8,B005LAIHSG,SpirituallySpeaking,"[4, 9]","I love the direction this film takes in telling a much darker version of the Snow White tale.  The production values are top notch and it looks fantastic.  Charlize Theron is outstanding as the wicked stepmother.  The back story she's given to justify her actions made her three dimensional and far more than a stock fairytale character.  The story also takes some terrific new directions and twists while still staying loyal to the original story, particulary in regard to how the dwarves come into play, how Snow is ultimately presented with the poisoned apple and the magical kiss she receives near the end.  These were terrific new twists and I loved where the story was going...but it just didn't seem to go far enough.There's a huge problem with pacing.  An enormous section lags in the middle when Snow and the Huntsman are wandering through the woods.  This seems to go on FOREVER, while the most interesting character, the queen is off-screen for FAR too long.  While Hemsworth is terrific and perfectly cast in his role, he's given virtually nothing to do but be Snow's chaperone through the whole story.  He's a great actor, and his character is given a solid backstory but it's never fully implemented into the plot.  Likewise, we're led to believe the Huntsman and Snow have developed a certain depth to their relationship by the end but there is absolutely NO evidence to support this change of heart.  Nothing.  The prince of the kindgom, overthrown by the wicked queen, is also trying to find Snow in the woods.  He loved her in his childhood and is desperately trying to locate her.  There was a TERRIFIC opportunity here to create a love triangle between the prince, huntsman and Snow that was completely ignored.Lastly, the biggest drawback of the film is Stewart.  Everything this girl does is delivered in a deadpan, disaffected tone with eyes hanging at half-staff.  She is so flat on screen and exudes ZERO energy that the times she's on screen (85% of the time), the move's momentum grinds to a hault.  It's VERY difficult to watch her and stay engaged because it seems, she's not either.Having said that, I'd still recommend it for the clever twists, Theron and Hemsworth's performances and some of the most gorgeous productions values I've seen in quite a while.  I loved where this film was headed but it seemed that the screenplay needed a couple of more drafts, a tightening of the story and more character development.

I would like to have seen Stewart's character involved in more fighting scenes, especially when she confronts the Queen.One aspect I really did not like was the ending because it left you hanging.

In some scenes, her hair looked like a rats nest and she's always pouting.Some of the situations throughout the movie were unexplained and unrealistic. It seems Hollywood is relying more and more on the stars' names and special effects than a well thought out storyline. I won't give any spoilers but may be some clues to what I'm talking about:Why isn't she dead already? An army comes and they bring a prisoner with them?? Seems everyone lives in a deadly forest?

I don't get why people always have to whisper in movies.  The magic mirror's not really a mirror, it's a gong.  I kept telling her, ""Bitch, that ain't no mirror!""  The queen's brother is seriously the biggest creeper I've ever seen in a movie.  There's one scene where Kristen Stewart's running away, and she happens to find a magically convenient horse, and she's like, ""Hey, can I ride you?"" and the horse is like, ""Sure.""  In another scene, she staves off a troll attack by batting her eyes at it.  The fairy forest is pretty awesome, I'd like to live there.  Oh, and there's ass-kicking dwarves.  No really, the dwarves are in this movie!Anyway.....it's a good movie.  The way it's advertised, you'd think it's just for teenagers, but that's not necessarily the case.  The romance is mostly a minor plot point, it's not overly sappy or anything.  A lot of people will immediately hate this movie just cause it has the Twilight chick in it.  They'll say, ""Oh my God, that person's existence is so untrendy!""  To them, I say grow up, it's not that big of a deal.  Basically, it's a spookier, more adult-ish version of the story.  If you're into that kind of imagery(I am), then you should like this movie.  If not, then you might like it anyway.  Give it a chance.  Don't just say, ""Oh, it's too gothic, it has Twilight lady in it!"" cause then you're attacking your own intelligence.  My only real complaint is that it's maybe a bit too long.  There's nothing mind-blowing about this movie, but it's all good fun.  Worth a rental at least.Of course, this movie begs the question...if you were friends with Snow White, what would you call her?

Airs on Saturday Midnight, well technically Sunday, from 12:00 a.m. to 3:00 a.m., with an encore beginning at 3:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.  Tune in and support it.  Now on to my review.----------------------------------------***Brief Review of Film***I just watched this on Sunday.  I also watched 'Promethesus'.  I can say with all honestly that I thought 'Snow White...' was much better.  The movie benefits from a good musical score, well known actors giving great performances, amazing CG effects, and a tried and true story that most people are familier with.**Plot Details/Some Spoilers Ahead**The film follows the classic tale of Snow White (Kristen Stewart) and how she was born to be the fairest of all the land.  Once Snow White's mother dies, her father marries Ravenna (Charlize Theron), who turns out to be an evil sorceress.  She quickly kills the King and overthrows the kingdom.  Snow White is then locked in a tower for many years.I personally thought that Charlize Theron did a superb job as Ravenna.  Ravenna is quite an evil character that you the viewer will hate.  You will not have one scrap of pity for her.  She is SO evil you can't help but want her defeated.  Theron's only flaw may be that she lays it on a little thick sometimes, she brings the crazy a little too hard.Well, before the Queen can cut out Snow White's heart and gain immortality forever, she escapes.  Enter the Huntsman (Chris Hemsworth aka ""Thor""), who is forced to track down Snow White and return her to the clutchs of the Queen.  Along the way the Huntsman changes his mind and decides to aid Snow White.  Although this was obviously a side project for Hemsworth, he really does give it his best, he is a good actor.  Women alone will watch this movie just to see him.I would like to add that I am not a fan of Kristen Stewart, especially after all the 'Twilight' movies.  But, in this movie I REALLY enjoyed her performance.  I also thought she looked and assumed the role quite well.  I will concede that she is apparently a talented actress.  I will in the future be on the watch for her non-'Twilight' movies.The movie also delivers the 8 Dwarves to assist Snow White.  Yes, I said 8, but don't worry they fix that mistake pretty quickly...In the end Snow White and her companions after being hunted and chased the entire movie, rally an army and march on the evil Queen's castle.  The Queen is finally defeated, but only after quite a few people die.  The kingdom and the land are restored to harmony, and the darkness of the evil sorceress is lifted.--Summing Up--This film at times feels like 'Lord of The Rings' and 'Chronicles of Narnia' combined.  Not that this is bad thing.  It is never sappy, Snow White is never singing to birds or deer or anything like that.  As I previously stated the CG effects are AMAZING, with all sorts of unique animals and creatures brought to life.  I will also dare say that there could be a sequel...time will tell.  The only CONS this movie has is that it doesn't go into detail about a few things.  Why does the evil Ravenna have so much power?  Who does Snow White love, William or the Huntsman?  Who was the giant deer with the large wooden antlers?  What were the Dwarves names again?  And so on.  In the end this is all minor stuff.Overall this is a really good movie that men and women alike will enjoy.  So husbands and boyfriends take your women to this one.  Good luck having them not fantasize afterword about Chris Hemsworth...",4,Good Revamp Of This Classic Story.,1339372800,"06 11, 2012",2012,3587,"['Public', 'service', 'announcement', 'begin', 'review', 'Toonami', 'back', 'Airs', 'Saturday', 'Midnight', 'well', 'technically', 'Sunday', '12:00', 'a.m.', '3:00', 'a.m.', 'encore', 'beginning', '3:00', 'a.m.', '6:00', 'a.m', 'Tune', 'support', 'Now', 'review.', '***Brief', 'Review', 'Film***I', 'just', 'watched', 'Sunday', 'also', 'watched', ""'Promethesus"", 'can', 'say', 'honestly', 'thought', 'White', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'benefits', 'good', 'musical', 'score', 'well', 'known', 'actors', 'giving', 'great', 'performances', 'amazing', 'CG', 'effects', 'tried', 'true', 'story', 'most', 'people', 'are', 'familier', 'Details/Some', 'Spoilers', 'Ahead**The', 'film', 'classic', 'tale', 'Snow', 'White', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'how', 'was', 'born', 'be', 'fairest', 'land', 'Once', 'Snow', 'White', 'mother', 'father', 'marries', 'Ravenna', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'evil', 'sorceress', 'quickly', 'King', 'kingdom', 'Snow', 'White', 'then', 'locked', 'tower', 'many', 'years.I', 'personally', 'thought', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'did', 'superb', 'job', 'Ravenna', 'Ravenna', 'quite', 'evil', 'character', 'viewer', 'will', 'hate', 'will', 'not', 'have', 'one', 'scrap', 'pity', 'SO', 'evil', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'want', 'defeated', 'Theron', 'only', 'flaw', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'thick', 'sometimes', 'crazy', 'little', 'too', 'hard.Well', 'Queen', 'can', 'cut', 'out', 'Snow', 'White', 'heart', 'gain', 'immortality', 'forever', 'Enter', 'Huntsman', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'Thor', 'who', 'forced', 'track', 'down', 'Snow', 'White', 'return', 'clutchs', 'Queen', 'way', 'Huntsman', 'mind', 'decides', 'aid', 'Snow', 'White', 'was', 'obviously', 'side', 'project', 'Hemsworth', 'really', 'give', 'best', 'good', 'actor', 'Women', 'alone', 'will', 'watch', 'movie', 'just', 'see', 'him.I', 'would', 'like', 'add', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'especially', ""'Twilight"", 'movies', 'movie', 'REALLY', 'enjoyed', 'performance', 'also', 'thought', 'looked', 'assumed', 'role', 'quite', 'well', 'will', 'concede', 'apparently', 'talented', 'actress', 'will', 'future', 'be', 'watch', ""non-'Twilight"", 'movies.The', 'movie', 'also', '8', 'Dwarves', 'assist', 'Snow', 'White', 'Yes', 'said', '8', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'fix', 'mistake', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'end', 'Snow', 'White', 'companions', 'being', 'hunted', 'chased', 'entire', 'movie', 'rally', 'army', 'march', 'evil', 'Queen', 'castle', 'Queen', 'finally', 'defeated', 'only', 'quite', 'few', 'people', 'die', 'kingdom', 'land', 'are', 'restored', 'harmony', 'darkness', 'evil', 'sorceress', 'lifted.', 'Summing', 'Up', 'film', 'times', 'feels', ""'Lord"", 'Rings', ""'Chronicles"", 'Narnia', 'combined', 'Not', 'bad', 'thing', 'never', 'sappy', 'Snow', 'White', 'never', 'singing', 'birds', 'deer', 'anything', 'previously', 'stated', 'CG', 'effects', 'are', 'AMAZING', 'sorts', 'unique', 'animals', 'creatures', 'brought', 'life', 'will', 'also', 'dare', 'say', 'could', 'be', 'sequel', 'time', 'will', 'tell', 'only', 'CONS', 'movie', ""n't"", 'go', 'detail', 'few', 'things', 'Why', 'evil', 'Ravenna', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'power', 'Who', 'Snow', 'White', 'love', 'William', 'Huntsman', 'Who', 'was', 'giant', 'deer', 'large', 'wooden', 'antlers', 'What', 'were', 'Dwarves', 'names', 'again', 'so', 'end', 'minor', 'stuff.Overall', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'men', 'women', 'alike', 'will', 'enjoy', 'So', 'husbands', 'boyfriends', 'take', 'women', 'one', 'Good', 'luck', 'having', 'not', 'fantasize', 'afterword', 'Chris', 'Hemsworth']",N/A
1473893,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B005LAIHSG,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[5, 9]","""Snow White and the Huntsman""  is a dark retelling of the famous fairy tale of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs that emphasizes toxic jealousy, the usurping of royal power, premeditated homicide, and the power of evil magic.Ravenna (Charlize Theron), an incredibly vain sorceress, has the ability to shape-shift, use her feminine wiles to enchant, and methodically seize absolute power.  Her prized possession is a round metallic mirror that assures her periodically that she is the fairest in the land.After Ravenna has successfully disposed of her husband, the king and father of young Snow White, the queen imprisons the child and rules with malevolence. Years later, when her mirror delivers the news that Snow White (Kristen Stewart) will soon surpass her as the most beautiful woman in the kingdom, the queen plots her death. But Show White escapes into the Dark Forest, a place where the queen's magic doesn't work. Ravenna summons a drunk, rough-hewn huntsman (Chris Hemsworth), and orders him to find the young woman and kill her.Ms. Theron acts up a storm here with a characterization that allows her plenty of opportunity to play her scenes to the max.  She makes a fearsomely wicked queen and, with the assistance of special effects, is a formidable adversary against Snow White.Hemsworth (Thor in ""The Avengers"") once again carries a weapon, this time an ax, as the unwilling killer.  He is a big guy with a deep voice who looks and sounds the part of an uneducated clod. He rises to a state of heroism when he realizes what Snow White is up against and transforms from would-be assassin to protector.Ms. Stewart (the ""Twilight"" saga) is the weak link in the cast. The script attempts to make Snow White more than a shuddering, defenseless naif, but Ms. Stewart appears to be phoning in her performance. There's little fire, and we never are convinced that she is in fear for her life.Director Rupert Sanders has crafted a smart-looking movie, with special effects worked smoothly into the narrative rather than overshadowing it.  There are phantom armies, characters morphing into others, and normal-sized actors -- Bob Hoskins, Ray Winstone, Toby Jones, and Ian McShane -- digitally shrunk to portray the dwarfs who become Show White's allies.The two-disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack contains numerous bonus extras, including audio commentary by director and key crew members; behind-the-scenes footage; a video tour of the Pinewood Studio's sets on which the movie was shot; and four featurettes covering visual effects, characterizations, fairy tale elements, and ""Tone Poem,"" a proof-of-concept reel that sold the studio on the project.

The sets, costumes and special FX scream huge budget. So why the 3 star you ask?Basically the story is way too much in just two hours, there are enough characters for a trilogy and not even remotely developed whereas the script is such a clich&eacute;d hodgepodge that It might have been written by a high-school drama class.I am seeing a lot of reviewers scathe Kristen Stewart and I'm thinking ""really?""... she's one of the more convincing domestic, action heroines I've seen in a film in years (never seen Twilight btw).  Folks it's not her acting, it's the incredibly lame dialogue that she and everyone else on the cast was given to read best epitomized by her final, ""climactic"" words to the evil queen: ""you can't have my heart"".  Give me a break, the queen's pretty much dead so a witty denial of her ultimate goal is a little late; couldn't she have said something like ""that's for my father"" or ""your reign ends here"" or even ""say hello to you brother for me creep"".Chris Hemsworth - He's tall, muscular, ridiculously handsome and an ac-tor in the truest sense of the word.  Maybe it comes from spending time around Kenneth Brannagh during the filming of Thor I dunno know but seriously, putting him up against pretty much any American, action star I can think of is like comparing Olivier to the cast of Bonanza.Charlize Theron does a fine job at being wickedly beautiful but we're supposed to believe that she is the ultimate source of evil in the land. Unfortunately none of the ""atrocities"" she frequently commits on screen are handled in such a way that would make an audience truly want to see her dead, her screaming is never malevolent but more hysterical, and seriously, if I was her brother watching her working magic I think I would awkwardly ask her if she wouldn't prefer to be alone.Unfortunately this film just asks too much of an audience; specifically having any genuine, emotional attachment to characters we've only just met while simultaneously being denied any real insight into what makes them tick.  If we are supposed to be sympathetic to Snow White shouldn't the story have focused more on her time in prison, her grief over her father and her people as well as any personal hopes and dreams she might've had?  They could've easily trimmed out the evil queen's nude, white-paint bathing scene or one of her many tantrums to allow a bit more screen time for developing the characters we're supposed to actually care about.  The dwarves for example are almost completely unlovable and are suddenly thrust into the story about halfway through and we're supposed to buy into them as an integral part of the ongoing struggle to free the kingdom from oppression; but they don't seem very effective or even necessary for that matter, rather I think they are just there because it's Snow White and well... they're dwarves.  Also the ""magical"" fairyland interlude was a total, un-magical failure not to mention super-superfluous and the ""menacing"" incursion by the Queen's brother and his not-so-threatening hunting party only left me wondering how they hadn't been wiped out already by a band of militant bunnies.  Also, if Duke Hammond has such a well-armed and large military force and a son with super-heroic bow-hunting skills then why in the world did he wait so long to attack the castle... I mean seriously, they couldn't have figured out the strategy to have somebody sneak in and raise the gate?  Finally, the most tragic part of this fantasy/romance is that Snow White and the Huntsman kind of leave us hanging in the final scene, as if she's just gonna sit around being admired by sycophantic nobles while he goes back to drinking and grumbling.Five stars for a good-looking production with fine actors but two for the reasons I've already mentioned which equals a three for me overall.  Apparently the fantasy genre is a little more demanding than some producers give it credit for.  :o)",3,"Ambitious Story, Just Doesn't Work",1347926400,"09 18, 2012",2012,4186,"['Visually', '5', 'star', 'easy', 'coolest', 'troll', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'castle', 'fantasy', 'perfection', 'armor', 'worn', 'legendary', 'Excalibur', 'shame', 'who', ""n't"", 'love', 'lots', 'mountains', 'forests', 'filmed', 'ultimate', 'cinematic', 'advantage', 'sets', 'costumes', 'special', 'FX', 'scream', 'huge', 'budget', 'So', 'why', '3', 'star', 'ask', 'Basically', 'story', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'just', 'two', 'hours', 'are', 'enough', 'characters', 'trilogy', 'not', 'even', 'remotely', 'developed', 'script', 'such', 'clich', 'eacute', 'hodgepodge', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'high-school', 'drama', 'class.I', 'am', 'seeing', 'lot', 'reviewers', 'scathe', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'really', 'one', 'more', 'convincing', 'domestic', 'action', 'heroines', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'years', 'never', 'seen', 'Twilight', 'btw', 'not', 'acting', 'incredibly', 'lame', 'dialogue', 'everyone', 'else', 'cast', 'was', 'given', 'read', 'best', 'epitomized', 'final', 'climactic', 'words', 'evil', 'queen', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'heart', 'Give', 'break', 'queen', 'pretty', 'much', 'dead', 'witty', 'denial', 'ultimate', 'goal', 'little', 'late', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'said', 'something', 'father', 'reign', 'here', 'even', 'say', 'hello', 'brother', 'creep', '.Chris', 'Hemsworth', 'tall', 'muscular', 'ridiculously', 'handsome', 'ac-tor', 'truest', 'sense', 'word', 'Maybe', 'spending', 'time', 'Kenneth', 'Brannagh', 'filming', 'Thor', 'dunno', 'know', 'seriously', 'putting', 'up', 'pretty', 'much', 'American', 'action', 'star', 'can', 'think', 'comparing', 'Olivier', 'cast', 'Bonanza.Charlize', 'Theron', 'fine', 'job', 'being', 'wickedly', 'beautiful', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'believe', 'ultimate', 'source', 'evil', 'land', 'Unfortunately', 'none', 'atrocities', 'frequently', 'screen', 'are', 'handled', 'such', 'way', 'would', 'make', 'audience', 'truly', 'want', 'see', 'dead', 'screaming', 'never', 'malevolent', 'more', 'hysterical', 'seriously', 'was', 'brother', 'watching', 'working', 'magic', 'think', 'would', 'awkwardly', 'ask', 'would', ""n't"", 'prefer', 'be', 'alone.Unfortunately', 'film', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'audience', 'specifically', 'having', 'genuine', 'emotional', 'attachment', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'only', 'just', 'met', 'simultaneously', 'being', 'denied', 'real', 'insight', 'what', 'tick', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'sympathetic', 'Snow', 'White', 'should', ""n't"", 'story', 'have', 'focused', 'more', 'time', 'prison', 'grief', 'father', 'people', 'as', 'well', 'personal', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'might', ""'ve"", 'had', 'could', ""'ve"", 'easily', 'trimmed', 'out', 'evil', 'queen', 'nude', 'white-paint', 'bathing', 'scene', 'one', 'many', 'tantrums', 'allow', 'bit', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'developing', 'characters', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'actually', 'care', 'dwarves', 'example', 'are', 'almost', 'completely', 'unlovable', 'are', 'suddenly', 'thrust', 'story', 'halfway', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'buy', 'integral', 'part', 'ongoing', 'struggle', 'free', 'kingdom', 'oppression', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'very', 'effective', 'even', 'necessary', 'matter', 'rather', 'think', 'are', 'just', 'there', 'Snow', 'White', 'well', ""'re"", 'dwarves', 'Also', 'magical', 'fairyland', 'interlude', 'was', 'total', 'un-magical', 'failure', 'not', 'mention', 'super-superfluous', 'menacing', 'incursion', 'Queen', 'brother', 'not-so-threatening', 'hunting', 'party', 'only', 'left', 'wondering', 'how', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'wiped', 'out', 'already', 'band', 'militant', 'bunnies', 'Also', 'Duke', 'Hammond', 'such', 'well-armed', 'large', 'military', 'force', 'son', 'super-heroic', 'bow-hunting', 'skills', 'then', 'why', 'world', 'did', 'wait', 'so', 'long', 'attack', 'castle', 'mean', 'seriously', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'figured', 'out', 'strategy', 'have', 'somebody', 'sneak', 'raise', 'gate', 'Finally', 'most', 'tragic', 'part', 'fantasy/romance', 'Snow', 'White', 'Huntsman', 'kind', 'leave', 'hanging', 'final', 'scene', 'just', 'gon', 'sit', 'around', 'being', 'admired', 'sycophantic', 'nobles', 'back', 'drinking', 'grumbling.Five', 'stars', 'good-looking', 'production', 'fine', 'actors', 'two', 'reasons', ""'ve"", 'already', 'mentioned', 'three', 'overall', 'Apparently', 'fantasy', 'genre', 'little', 'more', 'demanding', 'producers', 'give', 'credit', 'o']",N/A

1473901,A3DZCNEU21MB6L,B005LAIHSG,"THowerton ""SHowT""","[7, 10]","Does anyone remember back when rival Hollywood studios were putting out similar movies around the same time and there was the rush to get theirs out first thinking that the first one would take the majority of the box office?  I remember ""Dante's Peak"" and ""Volcano"" duking it out in this way, and especially ""Deep Impact"" and ""Armageddon"".  ""Deep Impact"" came out first but ""Armageddon"" sunk it at the box office because ""Armageddon"" was a boffo summer blockbuster popcorn flick with lots of edge of your seat action and big, splashy special effects.  ""Deep Impact"" suffered because it was marketed much in the same way but it was a substantially different movie; it was a female-centeric drama that centered on the end of the world.  Likewise this year with two new movies about the story of Snow White.  ""Mirror Mirror"", which came out before ""Snow White and the Huntsman"", suffered at the box office even though it hit first but not because it wasn't a special effects movie or a drama; it came in second between these two because it was geared and marketed toward a smaller niche (pre- and adolescent teenage girls) and was made to be a smaller movie both in scope and tone (comedy).  ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" is a big summer popcorn movie with great special effects and some decent sword and sandal action along with doses of magic (both black and white).  ""Mirror Mirror"" succeeded at what it was trying to do and was a fine and enjoyable movie but it was never going to match the moneymaking ability of this Snow White (and the stories between the two are very similar, unlike in the previous asteroid fests).SWATH stars a radiant Charlize Theron as the evil queen Ravenna who has lived for centuries and has been moving from kingdom to kingdom inserting herself by dispatching kings in seductive and nefarious ways in order to take over their kingdoms.  She doesn't really like men and she's evil as evidenced by her attraction to earth tones and black.  That, and she sucks the lifeforce out of other women (guess she doesn't really like women either).  She has a twin brother, Finn, an almost albino sychophant that serves her because she keeps him young and powerful.  The story gives you the slightest backstory for her, enough to make you go ""That's why she turned out so awful?"" but not enough for you to really sympathize with her...because she's such a witch.  The other two main stars are Kristen Stewart as the eponymous Snow White (merely adequate, sorry all you ""Twilight"" fans) and Chris Hemsworth (the guy who plays ""Thor"") as the huntsman.  Hemsworth shows off some acting chops in a few scenes where he chews and spits out his dialogue like he was born to play a medieval ruffian (must be all of that ""Thor"" norse god work he'd done) and he gives you plenty of reason to root and cheer for him (he lost his lady; he doesn't like himself because he knows what type of person he is) while Stewart mostly runs around the forests and castle looking a little stunned.  At the end when she gives her speech rousing the rebel villagers it...wasn't...that...well, rousing.  If there had been no musical cues for the audience and the villagers they just might have looked at her and slowly turned away.  In some minor roles (and by minor I mean they were dwarfs) some mega good actors showed up: Ian McShane; Bob Hoskins; Ray Winstone; Nick Frost; Brendan Gleeson.  I recognized many of them and then, knowing that they weren't actual dwarfs and I was watching special effects, I focused on the special effects unfortunately.  They did a great acting job and I'm not kidding that they could turn a middling movie into a stellar outing; I'd watch a movie about these seven dwarves sans Snow White and the evil queen.  It would be awesome!  Fortunately for us this movie is much better than middling.  There is a very good narrative flow to the movie, likable and sympathetic characters, despicable characters for us to root against, some light action sequences, and plenty of magic afoot along with a few mystical creatures.  The love triangle, not terribly played up thankfully, between Snow White and her youthful friend turned fiery bowman warrior (William) and the huntsman was a little distracting especially because it was not resolved.  For myself (a dude) I was split between which of the warriors I wanted to see get the girl; I liked them both and felt bad that one of them was going to get their heart broke but this fairy tale ended too soon so we never got to see whom Snow White picks...but you can see it in her eyes.

1473905,A373R1CJT7JEKT,B005LAIHSG,titania86,"[5, 9]","This fairy tale film follows the basic plot points of the Grimm's Brothers' classic tale while preserving and even deepening the dark tone and fleshing out the flat, stock characters. These efforts vary in level of success, so I will start with the aspects I felt were successful.  The original tale is already pretty dark by itself with the evil queen wanting to cannibalize Snow White, but the film pushes the boundaries even more than I expected. The Evil Queen is the most evil and sadistic than I have ever seen in a fairy tale film. She gleefully sucks the youth and beauty out of random townspeople to fuel her magic and keep herself looking flawless. Her ability to kill with a touch and create construct soldiers make of glass and rock give a sense of real danger to the tale. It doesn't come as a surprise that a large group of women gather their daughters to live in a town far away and scar their faces to avoid the queen's attention and need to destroy beauty. For a PG-13 fairy tale film, I was very impressed that the dark tone of the Grimm tale was preserved and even made darker than their version of the tale.Everything visual about the film was amazing. The setting and the special effects were phenomenal, especially the glass/metal constructs the queen makes. The CGI or makeup (I'm not sure which) that was used to age Charlize Theron's face was incredibly realistic. She went from young to old throughout the film in varying degrees in relation to how much magic she used and how many people she drained of youth and health. My favorite visual aspect was the costumes. Ravenna had about as many costume changes as Lady Gaga as she had different dress for almost every scene. The inclusion of bones was genius on her clothing as well as her metal claws and spiky crowns. There is no denying that this is a really pretty film.I loved the Evil Queen, Ravenna. Instead of a mindlessly evil, two dimensional character, we got a deliciously evil queen with a tragic past and awesome magical powers. She vehemently hates men because in her experience they use and discard women when they are no longer useful or beautiful. This mentality creates her obsession to stay young and beautiful to keep her powers. Ravenna is by far the most interesting and magnetic character in the film. I can't help but feel some sympathy for her even as she eats raven organs and sucks the youth and health from people while sadistically looking into their eyes as she does it. I wish the whole film would have been about her her life from penniless orphan leading up to becoming the evil sorceress queen that conquers kingdom after kingdom. Charlize Theron did an excellent job capturing Ravenna's wide range of emotion and making her the most memorable character in this retelling.The two things that really brought the film down for me were Kristen Stewart and the masses of unnecessary background characters. Kirsten Stewart's version of acting is grabbing her hair, sighing, hyperventilating, and leaving her mouth vacantly open for about 90% of the film. She has about 3 facial expressions and acts just as she does in Twilight and, from what I have seen, as she does in real life. Her character is only slightly better than Bella because the writing behind the film is better.The only nice thing I can say is that her natural hazel eye color looks much better than the brown contacts she had to wear in the Twilight films. In addition to a main character I cared literally nothing for, there were way too many minor characters. The Huntsman was fine and necessary, but Christ Hemsworth is a good actor and he was given very little to do. Snow's childhood friend Will was not needed at all. The love triangle had barely any actual romance and the two male characters could have been made into one. The dwarves were pretty useless as well, although generally enjoyable. They just seemed to eat up screen time while Snow meandered about until the final battle. The film needed a lot of streamlining both in the plot and in the characters.Overall, I would say Snow White and the Huntsman is an enjoyable summer movie. It's definitely not perfect and could have used a lot of improvement, but it's a small step in the right direction for fairy tale films.

Then they ruined the movie, for me by making a love interest between Snow White and the Huntsman, up until that point it really felt like a father daughter bond. The hunts man could have found redemption in that fatherly role. I am not a Kristen Stewart fan, but she did ok in this movie. Charlize Theron as always was mesmerizing. I liked Mirror Mirror more, though they are completely different in mood. This is a drama more atune to the original grim fairytale, the other is a comedy for entertainment purposes, but unlike most movie adaptations Mirror Mirror did not take liberties with the foundational plot line like Snow white and the Huntsman did.

Therefore, I was not expecting to be blown away by performances or bored out of my mind while watching it. Neither of those things happened for me. Granted, the first 20 minutes or so were a bit slow-paced for me, but after that, the pace was fine for me. It would definitely be a mistake for anyone to get this movie, expecting it to be kid-friendly. Like some people have mentioned in their reviews, the fact that Kristen Stewart (Snow White) always had the same expression on her face throughout the entire movie was probably the one minor setback in terms of acting. Charlize Theron (The Evil Queen) was without a doubt captivating as the villainous character of the film. I truly did find myself despising her character the whole time. That does not happen too often for me when I'm watching a movie unless the actor is so good at portraying the character. Chris Hemsworth (The Huntsman) did a pretty decent job in his role as the protector of Snow White. I'd have to say that metaphorically-speaking, I walked away from this movie awestruck--in a good way. It's not easy to say who I would recommend this film to. People who don't like Kristen Stewart will likely avoid seeing it. I suppose if you are a fan of action-packed, dark drama-type movies, this movie will appeal to you.

1473921,A2TXH9QKLD4ZVX,B005LAIHSG,TreyRoo1,"[1, 3]","Snow White is one of the oldest fairy tales ever written. Also the one most recently turned into a feature film. Less than three months ago, in fact. Is this Universal Pictures offering better or just some carbon copy?Snow White (played as a young woman by Raffey Cassidy) is the child of a benevolent king and a woman who died as a result of complications arising from childbirth. Despite her tragedy, however, she has a happy childhood. Then her father takes up arms against a dark army. The soldiers in that army, while capable of striking blows as fierce as any and fiercer than some, breaks like glass when struck by the enemy. With the dark army vanquished, the king inspects a carriage that survived the battle and finds a woman inside. The woman, Ravenna (played by Charlize Theron), soon marries the king who fell in love with her at first sight. She appears to have genuine affection for the king and Snow in the short period leading up to the wedding, but that is, of course, a ruse. On their wedding night, she murders her husband while her brother Finn (played by Sam Spruell) overruns the kingdom with the help of that same dark army that the king believed had kidnapped Ravenna. Snow attempts to flee, but is captured and imprisoned in the palace tower. Years pass and Ravenna maintains her beauty and youth by draining the life from young women whose beauty might one day surpass her own. Those women are identified by the queen's mirror and chief advisor (voiced by Christopher Obi Ogugwa). When she reaches adulthood, the mirror tells Ravenna that she may maintain her youth indefinitely if she kills Snow White and takes out her heart. Snow (now played by Kristen Stewart) escapes the kingdom when the queen sends her brother to escort her.Obviously, there's a great deal more to the story. For example, the Huntsman has yet to be introduced. Neither, for that matter, have the dwarves. And in this film, the men portraying the dwarves are of average or above average stature made to look like dwarves through the use of special effects as opposed to men who are actually shorter than 4'10"". There are comparisons being made between this film and Mirror Mirror, but they have very little in common, outside of the main characters. If more time had passed between the release dates, they'd stand separately and they should. It's like comparing Ridley Scott's Robin Hood to Robin Hood: Men in Tights.

Inspired by the fairy tale everyone knows, the film has great photography, great production designs and great costumes, plus stunning effects. What it does not have is an engaging story, a heroine you relate to, and a director who knows how to tell a story.Kristen Stewart plays the titular heroine, who escapes from Charlize Theron's evil queen into the dark forest, where she encounters the huntsman (Chris Hemsworth). What follows is their adventures and romance. The film's adventure part is just average with several decent action set-pieces. The film is also supposed to be a love story, but there is no passion throughout the story.For all the best efforts from the leads, the main characters Snow White and the Huntsman remain uninteresting in this dull and boring in this revisionist take of the fairy tale, which does not know what it really wants to do. Over-the-top Charlize Theron plays Ravenna, whose motive (and method) of taking over the kingdom never convinces. Actually, none of the film's characters are really credible, except supporting characters of digitally rendered dwarfs played by veterans Bob Hoskins, Toby Jones and Ray Winstone.Modern-day retelling of fairy tales is nothing new.

And while the costumes, sets, and scenery were all breathtaking, the plot fell flat. Hard.Charlize Theron was lovely and psychotic, but everyone else was... bland. Kristen Stewart? Please. She is nowhere near as beautiful as Theron, let alone MORE beautiful. It's obvious the producers were banking on riding her ""Twilight"" tails and hoping Twi-hard fans would fill the theater. And while I enjoy Stewart as an actress, she is somewhat one-dimensional; she does well with dark, gritty, angsty movies. She's too sulky and reserved to make an endearing or likeable Snow White, even a tough one. Compare her with Lily Collins (""Mirror, Mirror"") who was both ridiculously beautiful AND exquisitely charming... there IS no comparison.There also seemed to be this wanna-be love triangle thingie between Snow White, the Huntsman, and William (Snow's childhood sweetheart/friend). But it never goes anywhere. Nobody falls in love with anybody. Nobody winds up with anybody. It didn't make sense. There's all this gazing and sighing and romantic introspection, and then... that's it. Huh?By the way, what is the white plaster-of-Paris stuff that Theron bathes in? Yes, it's striking and beautiful to watch, but WHAT is it? Milk? It's too thick and coating to be milk. Not sure what else it COULD be...In the end, the movie dragged on too long, tried to follow too many mini-plots (the Duke, the rebels, the dwarves, the fairy-critters, the scarred-face women), and ultimately felt exhausting and predictable. We know the fairy tale too well to be surprised by anything. I wished they'd veered away from the story everyone knows and thrown in some surprises. Somewhere. Something. Please! I still had about an hour of the film left, and I already knew what was coming; Snow White would fight the Queen, kill her, become Queen herself, happily ever after, tada.

It is a clever comedy with sets and visuals that Singh is noted for. It was fun and a much better version of the Snow White story than this one.  The CGI and setting in that film worked with the picture.  In this film, some of the CGI was just bad.  The great white hart was awful, an affront to the lovers of Cernunos everywhere.Snow White and the Huntsman  has an interesting story line.  Ms Theron did an interesting job on the evil queen but aside from getting to over emote in a few places the director never let her go.  I wanted to see more of the Monster passion from her.  The huntsman was equally constrained.  The actress who played Snow White did a better job when she was dead.  She should play a tree in the next Tolkien movie.  Loved the dwarves. The rest of the cast just did not have much to do other than reciting lines in a very dull way.  Next time make the film from the dwarves' point of view.

1473952,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B005LAIHSG,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[13, 20]","Snow White and the Huntsman is one of those films that leaves you wondering how they managed to get so much brilliantly right, coming so close to being a classic, and yet fall short because of baffling flaws that threaten to sink it like a lead weight.On the brilliant side, you start with the highly ambitious script by Evan Daugherty, John Lee Hancock and Hossein Amini. They flesh out the story of Snow White by not only drawing on the variant versions of the original fairy tale for extra detail but also by adding in background elements to give depth and reality to the world in which it takes place, where reality and magic are inextricably linked and the rise and fall of innocence affect the very land itself. Thus this Snow White is both magical and epic in scale and consequence, far above the simple tale related by the Brothers Grimm.  The characters are themselves equally fleshed out, most particularly the evil queen, who sets a new standard by which all other fairy tale evil queens will hence be measured.  For the first time, the evil queen - Ravenna by name in this case - actually comes with a back story, not only for how she actually became queen but also for why she came to be evil in the first place. You may not sympathize with her, but her behavior becomes much more understandable when you see how she came to where she is at the time of the story. Also brought into greater depth are the Huntsman and the Prince (in this case a duke's son) and the roles they play in Snow White's ultimate fate.And most brilliant of all is Charlize Theron's portrayal of Ravenna. She transforms herself on the screen like the chameleon Ravenna is, going from seeming helpless captive to enchanting beauty to imperious queen, only letting her cold ruthlessness and deadly intensity show through when it suits her purpose. Theron does with a glance or a turn of the head, or even just the way she walks across a room, what lesser actors would take lines of dialogue to convey.Another big plus is the cinematography and the art design, making the settings both realistic and yet fitting backdrops for a fairy tale at the same time. The way the enchanted forest is done here stands as superior to any that I've seen in any other film, truly magical and full of wonder. And then there's their truly original take on the Magic Mirror, an enormous polished-metal disc of the kind actually used back in ancient and early medieval times instead of the silver-backed glass we're familiar with. And the unique way it came to life to answer the Queen's questions was quite well done and add much to the eerie atmosphere that always seemed to surround Theron's Ravenna. A very nice touch indeed. As was the dark and ominous crown Ravenna ends up wearing when she is queen, the design perfectly suited to project a combination of power and ruthless resolve.Of all the things weighing the film down however, Kristen Stewart's Snow White unfortunately tops the list. Part of this - the way the character was written - is admittedly not her fault. The acting however - or rather the lack thereof - is. Stewart's performance belongs to the Keannu Reeves' one-facial-expression-for-the-entire-film school of acting. Worse still, it's the same facial expression she used through the entire Twilight series, as if she wandered off the set for those films and onto the set for this one, stopping only for a costume change. And her limitations become more pronounced as the script demands greater and less plausible things of the character, most particularly Snow White as a fairy tale Joan Of Arc.  This was one of the really hard to swallow even for a fairy tale moments: a princess, who's spent most of her childhood locked away in a tower, is suddenly donning armor and leading a rebel army into battle with sword and shield (but strangely without a helmet) like a war-hardened veteran?Another big problem is in the script itself.  While I appreciate the ambitiousness that really added to the early part of the movie, it becomes clear as the film progresses that a number of things were not really thought through and other things were simply bad ideas. I've already mentioned the strange way in which Snow White inexplicably suddenly morphs - not remotely convincingly - into Snow White: Warrior Princess. The seven dwarves, who were key to the original fairy tale, have been reduced to near irrelevance here. You could in fact cut pretty much all of their scenes and it wouldn't affect the basic plot one bit. While the CGI-enhanced actors do a decent job of bringing the dwarves to life, the problem remains that they really have little to do and end up making parts of the movie drag. Another bad idea comes in the form of the ""Curse of Twilight"", i.e. the female hero must have two male counterparts as potential love interests, regardless of how little sense it makes or how awkwardly its handled. The idea to flesh out the Huntsman and the Prince was good, but then taking that and giving them the Twilight treatment really hobbled the movie, particularly as it was not remotely believable. Worse, it was baffling in that it not only messed with the whole fairy tale feel of the story, it led absolutely nowhere and was left like a jarringly unresolved plot thread at the end leaving you wondering what the writers had been thinking. As other reviewers have mentioned, they'd have been far better off going with just combining the characters into one. Add in the fact that Kristen Stewart's one-note Snow White had absolutely no chemistry with either Chris Hemsworth's Hunter or Sam Claflin's Prince William and it just really sucked the air out of a good third of the movie, to the point where you just want Charlize Theron's Ravenna to come back and get things moving once again.Another problem was Bob Hoskins' head dwarf, Muir.  Hoskins, an actor whose work is generally always excellent, is strangely out of sorts here as his eyes never seemed to focus on anyone or anything. I later learned that apparently Muir is supposed to be blind, but the way it was handled in the film this was never made clear. Assuming this to be true however, then this was one of the worst portrayals of a blind person I've ever seen as nothing else about the way he acted or held his head or moved about rang true to the way real blind people I've known do those things.  It was instead simply baffling as Hoskins went through the movie with this inexplicably vacant and unsettling stare. The only possible excuse I can think of is that this was perhaps due to the way that the CGI-dwarfing of his character was handled which may have resulted in the more physical parts of Hoskins' performance being 'lost in translation' as it were.A more niggling problem, for me anyway, was the fact that the Huntsman was always armed with - and only with - a double-bladed war ax and a set of throwing axes.  I'm sorry, but even fairy tale huntsmen don't go hunting with axes.  They use bows, knives and traps. One supposes that they didn't let Hemsworth's Huntsman use a bow because Claflin's Prince was already using a bow, but that also doesn't make sense because the nobility didn't go to war with bows.All of that said though, I still feel Snow White and the Huntsman is worth seeing for the good things it brings to the genre and for Charlize Theron's stand-out performance as Ravenna. Recommended for any fan of retellings of classic fairy tales, of Charlize Theron and for students of why near-great films sometimes end up being pulled down by their flaws.",3,"An uneven mix, 3/4

Stewart is horribly cast in the lead, incapable of showing any more expression than her usual sullenness, and cannot act even if her life depended on it.

Totally absurd but still a good movie worth watching for the special effects and the incredible performance of Charlize Theron.This is a free adaptation of the well know Snow White story, with several bad actors. The evil queen Ravenna (Charlize Theron) saves the movie. Great presence and great acting as always. She definitely took over the movie. Although I knew the end of the movie (...who doesn't) I was rooting for the mean queen. I was really sad at the end when she died and she became old. Even then she was better looking than Snow White. Kristen Stewart is not believable in her role (she is not good actrice anyway), and the Huntsman has an Irish/Scottish accent that is annoying. We really don't believe anytime during the two hours that Hemsworth is this solid guy that will save Stewart in the dark forest and will protect her from all the mean spirits. The kissing scene where Snow White stands up and walk after eating the apple is so poorly done that is laughable. There is another character in the movie, an old friend of Snow White that we don't know exactly what he does and why he is there.In order to make the movie better they should first try to find somebody who is a better actor that Stewart. Second there is a huge disadvantage to compare ANY woman to Charlize Theron (even the older version of the queen towards the end of the movie). They should have definitely find somebody else representing the mean ugly queen who is not as good looking as Charlize Theron. The only time that the words ugly and Charlize Theron can be used in the same sentence is the film ""Monster"". She definitely deserved the oscar with that performance.I definitely liked the movie (4 stars) and the special effects are just awesome.

1473973,A1TLNRAKUZET61,B005LAIHSG,Zoi Grey,"[3, 6]",I really wanted to like this movie but I couldn't get past Kristen Stewart's awful acting and the substandard plot. Chris Hensworth manages to carry a good deal of the movie but he couldn't carry a crazy script and an unlikeable leading lady. It was visually stunning but the rest fell short in execution. This movie bit off more than it could chew and suffered greatly for it.,2,Fairytale Fail!,1347494400,"09 13, 2012",2012,377,"['really', 'wanted', 'like', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'past', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'awful', 'acting', 'substandard', 'plot', 'Chris', 'Hensworth', 'carry', 'good', 'deal', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'carry', 'crazy', 'script', 'unlikeable', 'leading', 'lady', 'was', 'visually', 'stunning', 'rest', 'fell', 'short', 'execution', 'movie', 'bit', 'more', 'could', 'chew', 'suffered', 'greatly']",N/A
