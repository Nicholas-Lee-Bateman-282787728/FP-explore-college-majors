I had to stop after 30 minutes and find something better to watch.I was willing to forget that 90% of the so-called Puerto Ricans acted Jewish.  Really, I was.  Give me a good story and I'll overlook bad performances.  But all I saw was a bunch of ethnic stereotypes shouting and slapping each other without a single laugh in the thing.",1,What a waste,1212969600,"06 9, 2008",2008,407,"['reviewer', 'who', 'got', 'defective', 'DVD', 'definitely', 'winner', 'here', 'had', 'stop', '30', 'minutes', 'find', 'something', 'better', 'watch.I', 'was', 'willing', 'forget', '90', '%', 'so-called', 'Puerto', 'Ricans', 'acted', 'Jewish', 'Really', 'was', 'Give', 'good', 'story', ""'ll"", 'overlook', 'bad', 'performances', 'saw', 'was', 'bunch', 'ethnic', 'stereotypes', 'shouting', 'slapping', 'other', 'single', 'laugh', 'thing']",N/A

735644,A35MB3HSLQBXBG,B000089732,David Freydkin,"[4, 5]","Popi is about a Puerto Rican widower named Abraham living in Manhatten with his two sons Junior and Luis. They live in an impoverished high-crime neighborhood. He works 60 hours a week doing blue collar jobs and gets 5 hours sleep per night. He wants to get his sons out of the neighborhood with a plan of faking their arrival on Miami Beach as escapen refugees from Cuba, hence getting nationwide attention and potential adoption to wealthier families. Once his sons get cruelly bullied by fellow neighborhood kids, Abraham finally decides to implement his plan. It works at first and all eyes in the US are on the two boys. But at the end, they virtually throw all possibilities of adoption and a better life away and reveal their identity to stay with their Popi, their father.I love this movie and classify it as one of my all-time favorites. It is the most emotionally confusing movie I have ever seen. It is both sad, happy, and funny in one. The ending is one of the most funny, sad, and happy endings I have ever seen. In the movie, you sympathize with Abraham for living in impoverished conditions with his kids, working his fanny off, and just wanting a better life for them. Yet, at the end, the movie proves one of the most important messages in life: no money in the world can replace the love of family.",5,The most emotionally confusing movie ever,1101081600,"11 22, 2004",2004,1317,"['Popi', 'Puerto', 'Rican', 'widower', 'named', 'Abraham', 'living', 'Manhatten', 'two', 'sons', 'Junior', 'Luis', 'live', 'impoverished', 'high-crime', 'neighborhood', '60', 'hours', 'week', 'doing', 'blue', 'collar', 'jobs', '5', 'hours', 'sleep', 'night', 'get', 'sons', 'neighborhood', 'plan', 'faking', 'arrival', 'Miami', 'Beach', 'escapen', 'refugees', 'Cuba', 'hence', 'getting', 'nationwide', 'attention', 'potential', 'adoption', 'wealthier', 'families', 'sons', 'get', 'cruelly', 'bullied', 'fellow', 'neighborhood', 'kids', 'Abraham', 'finally', 'implement', 'plan', 'first', 'eyes', 'US', 'are', 'two', 'boys', 'end', 'virtually', 'throw', 'possibilities', 'adoption', 'better', 'life', 'away', 'reveal', 'identity', 'stay', 'Popi', 'father.I', 'love', 'movie', 'classify', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorites', 'most', 'emotionally', 'confusing', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'sad', 'happy', 'funny', 'one', 'ending', 'one', 'most', 'funny', 'sad', 'happy', 'endings', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'sympathize', 'Abraham', 'living', 'impoverished', 'conditions', 'kids', 'working', 'fanny', 'just', 'wanting', 'better', 'life', 'end', 'movie', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'messages', 'life', 'money', 'world', 'can', 'replace', 'love', 'family']",N/A

He does this in the hope that they will eventually bepicked up and mistakenly thought to be refugees from Cuba. They wouldthen be adopted by a good family in the United States where they wouldbe looked after and properly educated.It's a perfect example of how the best laid plans can go wrong and inthis case they do and with amusing results.The movie has a happy ending. The boys are re-united with their dad.Dad eventually comes to realize that the boys don't want to be adoptedand would rather live with their dad whom they love.They all eventually return to Puerto Rico to face what life has tothrow at them.The movie which is a mixture of drama and comedy is presented with agood deal of charm.
