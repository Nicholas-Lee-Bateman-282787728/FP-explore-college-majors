477245,A25ID3G0ZQR1G5,6305772525,CinemaNET,"[7, 7]","... just kidding.  &quot;Five Characters in Search of an Exit&quot; is one of the best Twilight Zone episodes ever, and it is included in this DVD. Written by series creator Rod Serling, it is obviously based on &quot;Six  Characters in Search of an Author&quot;, a 1921 theater play by italian  Luigi Pirandello, which also inspired Paul Sartre's &quot;No Exit&quot;.  It's a claustrophobic story about a soldier, a ballet dancer, a clown, a  musician and a wonderer trapped in a cilinder shaped room with no doors...  the outcome is sorpresive, incredibly original and terrifying. Vincenzo  Natali, a canadian filmmaker, also took a very similar ground for his  sci-fi movie &quot;The Cube&quot;... The other episodes included are  &quot;Mirror Image&quot; (Season 1) where a woman finds a  &quot;double&quot; of herself (scary), &quot;Dust&quot; (Season 2) about a  man's execution and &quot;Ninety Years Without Slumbering&quot; (Season 5),  about a man that believes that his life depends on his grandfather's clock  . This last episode is the only one not written by Serling on this DVD.",5,Five Stars in Search of a Review...,962928000,"07 7, 2000",2000,1093,"['just', 'kidding', 'quot', 'Five', 'Characters', 'Search', 'Exit', 'quot', 'one', 'best', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'ever', 'included', 'DVD', 'Written', 'series', 'creator', 'Rod', 'Serling', 'obviously', 'based', 'quot', 'Six', 'Characters', 'Search', 'Author', 'quot', '1921', 'theater', 'play', 'italian', 'Luigi', 'Pirandello', 'also', 'inspired', 'Paul', 'Sartre', 'quot', 'No', 'Exit', 'quot', 'claustrophobic', 'story', 'soldier', 'ballet', 'dancer', 'clown', 'musician', 'wonderer', 'trapped', 'cilinder', 'shaped', 'room', 'doors', 'outcome', 'sorpresive', 'incredibly', 'original', 'terrifying', 'Vincenzo', 'Natali', 'canadian', 'filmmaker', 'also', 'took', 'very', 'similar', 'ground', 'sci-fi', 'movie', 'quot', 'Cube', 'quot', 'other', 'episodes', 'included', 'are', 'quot', 'Mirror', 'Image', 'quot', 'Season', '1', 'where', 'woman', 'quot', 'double', 'quot', 'herself', 'scary', 'quot', 'Dust', 'quot', 'Season', '2', 'man', 'execution', 'quot', 'Ninety', 'Slumbering', 'quot', 'Season', '5', 'man', 'life', 'grandfather', 'clock', 'last', 'episode', 'only', 'one', 'not', 'written', 'Serling', 'DVD']",N/A

In this interesting and unsettling episode Vera Miles is a woman whose sense of reality is shattered when she encounters her exact double in a bus station. And so it goes.DUST (January 6, 1961, Episode 48) is another great Western episode written by Rod Serling with Thomas Gomez, Vladimir Sokoloff, John Alonso and John Larch. On the day of his hanging, a man's father is conned by a obnoxious traveling salesman who sells him ""magic dust"" capable of eliminating hate. Is the dust simply a handful of dirt or is it something more?FIVE CHARACTERS IN SEARCH OF AN EXIT (December 22, 1961, Episode 79) written by Rod Serling and directed by Lamont Johnson is another classic and memorable episode. In this surreal episode, five people try to figure a way to escape from a large cylindrical container that they are trapped in. They each come from five very dissimilar walks of life. They each have no memory of who they are or how they came to be there. The cast is very strong here and very much makes this episode work. They are William Windom, Murray Matheson, Susan Harrison, Kelton Garwood, Clark Allen, Mona Houghton and Carol Hill.NINETY YEARS WITHOUT SLUMBERING (December 20, 1963, Episode 132) written by George C. Johnson is an interesting episode with Ed Wynn as he plays an old man who is convinced that his life will end the moment his grandfather's clock breaks down. Bernard Herrmann's score is very good and very key to this episode.",5,All Classics,1379808000,"09 22, 2013",2013,1563,"['MIRROR', 'IMAGE', 'February', '26', '1960', 'Episode', '21', 'written', 'Rod', 'Serling', 'directed', 'John', 'Brahm', 'interesting', 'stuff', 'interesting', 'unsettling', 'episode', 'Vera', 'Miles', 'woman', 'sense', 'reality', 'shattered', 'when', 'exact', 'double', 'bus', 'station', 'goes.DUST', 'January', '6', '1961', 'Episode', '48', 'great', 'Western', 'episode', 'written', 'Rod', 'Serling', 'Thomas', 'Gomez', 'Vladimir', 'Sokoloff', 'John', 'Alonso', 'John', 'Larch', 'day', 'hanging', 'man', 'father', 'conned', 'obnoxious', 'traveling', 'salesman', 'who', 'magic', 'dust', 'capable', 'eliminating', 'hate', 'dust', 'simply', 'handful', 'dirt', 'something', 'more', 'FIVE', 'CHARACTERS', 'IN', 'SEARCH', 'AN', 'EXIT', 'December', '22', '1961', 'Episode', '79', 'written', 'Rod', 'Serling', 'directed', 'Lamont', 'Johnson', 'classic', 'memorable', 'episode', 'surreal', 'episode', 'five', 'people', 'try', 'figure', 'way', 'escape', 'large', 'cylindrical', 'container', 'are', 'trapped', 'come', 'five', 'very', 'dissimilar', 'walks', 'life', 'have', 'memory', 'who', 'are', 'how', 'came', 'be', 'there', 'cast', 'very', 'strong', 'here', 'very', 'much', 'episode', 'work', 'are', 'William', 'Windom', 'Murray', 'Matheson', 'Susan', 'Harrison', 'Kelton', 'Garwood', 'Clark', 'Allen', 'Mona', 'Houghton', 'Carol', 'Hill.NINETY', 'YEARS', 'WITHOUT', 'SLUMBERING', 'December', '20', '1963', 'Episode', '132', 'written', 'George', 'C.', 'Johnson', 'interesting', 'episode', 'Ed', 'Wynn', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'convinced', 'life', 'will', 'end', 'moment', 'grandfather', 'clock', 'breaks', 'down', 'Bernard', 'Herrmann', 'score', 'very', 'good', 'very', 'key', 'episode']",N/A
477248,A366S12KCZ280V,6305772525,"Janet Chandler ""Music/Movie Lover""","[0, 0]","Volume 21 in the ""Twilight Zone"" DVD series features some of the very best episodes from the show. Two of them I think would classify as classics but all four stories on this disc are strong with great writing, directing and most of all great actors on here.It begins with  ""Mirror Image"". It stars Vera Miles and a young Martin Milner. In the story Miles plays a woman named Millicent Barnes who starts to wonder if she might be going crazy. It starts while at a bus station waiting for her bus to arrive. While waiting she starts to notice her bag has been moved around. Plus when she goes up to the booth to ask the guy behind the counter when her bus should arrive he tells her she just asked him that a couple of minutes ago. But she doesn't remember asking him that question a couple of minutes ago. Then she spots herself, or is it an exact double of her? She meets a young man named Paul Grinstead, played by Milner, who at first thinks she just might be a little crazy until he sees something. It ends with one of those TZ endings we all know and love. I would rate this as one of those classic episodes.""Dust"" is the next offering on the DVD and while most people don't seem to care about this one too much I rate this as one of my fave episodes. It takes place in the old west where a young man is waiting to be hanged for the accidental death of a little girl he killed while driving a wagon drunk. The young man's father, played by Vladimir Sokoloff, meanwhile is looking for mercy from a town that wants justice. Then the Father meets a peddler who claims he has some magic dust that could save his son if the father can come up with the money. When the father leaves to try and come up with the money to buy the magic dust we see that the peddler is obviously scamming the father. But this IS the ""Twilight Zone"" where what happens can and will surprise you. While I would not say this is one of those classic episodes it is still to me a very strong one.The other story on here that I think classifies as a classic as well as unique story is ""Five Characters in Search of an Exit"". Question. What do a clown, a hobo, a ballerina, a Scottish bagpipe player and an Army Major have in common? Answer. Well there are two things. First they are all stuck in a large cylinder structure from which they don't know how they got there or how to get out. Second, well they are in the Twilight Zone. The story opens with the Army Major waking up to find himself in the cylinder with the other occupants. Of course the Major is a man of action and starts to try to figure a way out for all of them but every idea he comes up with is shot down by the others, especially the clown, because it had already been tried by them with no luck. One of the best parts to me with this episode is the dialog that takes place among everyone especially between the Major and the clown. Both parts are played brilliantly by William Windom as the Major and  Murray Matheson as the clown. This is ""Twilight Zone"" at its very best!The last story to be told on the disc is not a classic but still a very good episode starring the much beloved actor Ed Wynn. It is  ""Ninety Years Without Slumbering"". It is from the fifth and last season of ""Twilight Zone"". In it Wynn owns a grandfather clock and believes his life is connected to that clock. If the clock ever stops ticking then he will die. Of course he goes to great length to make sure the clock never runs down, even after he is talked into selling his clock to the next door neighbors. The ending is kind of predictable but still good. What helps to save the story is Ed Wynn himself who gives a very good performance.This is a great volume of the ""Twilight Zone series to own if you are a fan and don't have this. I would rate this DVD as one of the better ones of the series of volumes and would definitely recommend this.",5,Some Outstanding Episodes,1389830400,"01 16, 2014",2014,3865,"['Volume', '21', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'DVD', 'series', 'very', 'best', 'episodes', 'show', 'Two', 'think', 'would', 'classify', 'classics', 'four', 'stories', 'disc', 'are', 'strong', 'great', 'writing', 'directing', 'most', 'great', 'actors', 'here.It', 'Mirror', 'Image', 'Vera', 'Miles', 'young', 'Martin', 'Milner', 'story', 'Miles', 'woman', 'named', 'Millicent', 'Barnes', 'who', 'wonder', 'might', 'be', 'going', 'crazy', 'bus', 'station', 'waiting', 'bus', 'arrive', 'waiting', 'notice', 'bag', 'been', 'moved', 'around', 'when', 'up', 'booth', 'ask', 'guy', 'counter', 'when', 'bus', 'should', 'arrive', 'just', 'asked', 'couple', 'minutes', 'ago', ""n't"", 'remember', 'asking', 'question', 'couple', 'minutes', 'ago', 'Then', 'spots', 'exact', 'double', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Paul', 'Grinstead', 'played', 'Milner', 'who', 'first', 'just', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'crazy', 'something', 'one', 'TZ', 'endings', 'know', 'love', 'would', 'rate', 'one', 'classic', 'episodes', 'Dust', 'next', 'offering', 'DVD', 'most', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'care', 'one', 'too', 'much', 'rate', 'one', 'fave', 'episodes', 'place', 'old', 'west', 'where', 'young', 'man', 'waiting', 'be', 'hanged', 'accidental', 'death', 'little', 'girl', 'killed', 'driving', 'wagon', 'drunk', 'young', 'man', 'father', 'played', 'Vladimir', 'Sokoloff', 'meanwhile', 'looking', 'mercy', 'town', 'justice', 'Then', 'Father', 'peddler', 'who', 'magic', 'dust', 'could', 'save', 'son', 'father', 'can', 'come', 'up', 'money', 'When', 'father', 'try', 'come', 'up', 'money', 'buy', 'magic', 'dust', 'see', 'peddler', 'obviously', 'scamming', 'father', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'where', 'what', 'can', 'will', 'surprise', 'would', 'not', 'say', 'one', 'classic', 'episodes', 'still', 'very', 'strong', 'one.The', 'other', 'story', 'here', 'think', 'classifies', 'classic', 'as', 'well', 'unique', 'story', 'Five', 'Characters', 'Search', 'Exit', 'Question', 'What', 'do', 'clown', 'hobo', 'ballerina', 'Scottish', 'bagpipe', 'player', 'Army', 'Major', 'have', 'common', 'Answer', 'Well', 'are', 'two', 'things', 'First', 'are', 'stuck', 'large', 'cylinder', 'structure', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'got', 'there', 'how', 'get', 'out', 'Second', 'well', 'are', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'story', 'Army', 'Major', 'waking', 'up', 'find', 'cylinder', 'other', 'occupants', 'course', 'Major', 'man', 'action', 'try', 'figure', 'way', 'idea', 'up', 'shot', 'down', 'others', 'especially', 'clown', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'tried', 'luck', 'One', 'best', 'parts', 'episode', 'dialog', 'place', 'everyone', 'especially', 'Major', 'clown', 'parts', 'are', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'William', 'Windom', 'Major', 'Murray', 'Matheson', 'clown', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'very', 'best', 'last', 'story', 'be', 'told', 'disc', 'not', 'classic', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'episode', 'starring', 'much', 'beloved', 'actor', 'Ed', 'Wynn', 'Ninety', 'Years', 'Slumbering', 'fifth', 'last', 'season', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'Wynn', 'grandfather', 'clock', 'life', 'connected', 'clock', 'clock', 'ever', 'ticking', 'then', 'will', 'die', 'course', 'great', 'length', 'make', 'sure', 'clock', 'never', 'down', 'even', 'talked', 'selling', 'clock', 'next', 'door', 'neighbors', 'ending', 'kind', 'predictable', 'still', 'good', 'What', 'save', 'story', 'Ed', 'Wynn', 'who', 'very', 'good', 'performance.This', 'great', 'volume', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'series', 'own', 'are', 'fan', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'would', 'rate', 'DVD', 'one', 'better', 'ones', 'series', 'volumes', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend']",N/A

It exudes an atmosphere of loneliness and existential dread that were the special province of The Twilight Zone.  The tale of a young woman who encounters her doppelganger while waiting for a bus late on a rainy November night is told to perfection through tight writing (Rod Serling), evocative direction and photography (John Brahm and George Clemens, respectively), and above all an intense, dramatically urgent performance from the classy Vera Miles.  The episode is pregnant with metaphorical meaning; once seen, it will lodge in your memory.""Five Characters in Search of an Exit"", inspired by Pirandello's play ""Five Characters in Search of an Author"" is a well-known and favorite Twilight Zone episode, but to me it has always seemed pretentious and, in its twist ending, disappointing and not a little silly.An unjustly maligned episode (because its ending was rewritten) is ""Ninety Years Without Slumbering"", from season 5, the story of an old man who believes that he will die if his grandfather clock stops.
