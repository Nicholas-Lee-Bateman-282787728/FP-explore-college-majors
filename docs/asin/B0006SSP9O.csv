If you are a fan of ""The A-Team,"" ""The Rockford Files"" or even ""21 Jump Street,"" you must see these interviews!I am a huge fan of Mike Post and his musical creations for Cannell's shows, so it is a real thrill to hear how the duo first met and the thought process for many of his themes (""Wiseguy,"" ""Silk Stalkings,"" and of course ""The Greatest American Hero"").  We get the same kind of thing from the interviews with Cannell as we find out how he got in the business and his thought process behind ""Rockford,"" ""The A-Team"" and more.Why these gems are on this particular show, I have no idea, but they alone are worth the price of the set.",4,Stephen J.

The show is about an ordinary person (Ralph Hinkley, the school teacher), who is given a suit with powers.  He teams up with an FBI agent (Bill Maxwell) and together they fight crime.What I like most about the show is that whenever Ralph puts on the suit, he is not perfect when using the suit because he is still getting used to his new powers.  I remember my friends and I used to make fun of him because he always had trouble flying (and landing).For die-hard fans of the show, the proposed spinoff pilot ""Greatest American Heroine"", is worth a look, but it's easy to see why it did not become a series.The interview with series creator Stephen Cannell explains a lot about the series including how it was created and why it only lasted two and half years.The book that shows what is on which DVD is in the form of the ""instructions book"" that Ralph lost in the pilot/first episode.If you look in the first few minutes of ""Fire Man"", Danny Glover plays a police officer.",5,A school teacher that flies and saves the day,1108339200,"02 14, 2005",2005,1072,"['remember', 'watching', 'show', 'Wednesday', 'nights', 'just', 'as', 'fun', 'watch', 'now', 'was', 'then', 'show', 'ordinary', 'person', 'Ralph', 'Hinkley', 'school', 'teacher', 'who', 'given', 'suit', 'powers', 'up', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Bill', 'Maxwell', 'together', 'fight', 'crime.What', 'like', 'most', 'show', 'whenever', 'Ralph', 'suit', 'not', 'perfect', 'when', 'using', 'suit', 'still', 'getting', 'used', 'new', 'powers', 'remember', 'friends', 'used', 'make', 'fun', 'always', 'had', 'trouble', 'flying', 'landing', '.For', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'show', 'proposed', 'spinoff', 'pilot', 'Greatest', 'American', 'Heroine', 'look', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'did', 'not', 'become', 'series.The', 'interview', 'series', 'creator', 'Stephen', 'Cannell', 'lot', 'series', 'including', 'how', 'was', 'created', 'why', 'only', 'lasted', 'two', 'years.The', 'book', 'what', 'DVD', 'form', 'instructions', 'book', 'Ralph', 'lost', 'pilot/first', 'episode.If', 'look', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'Fire', 'Man', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'police', 'officer']",The Greatest American Hero - Season One
873789,A2K8LYR0PLES3,B0006SSP9O,Annon,"[2, 2]","Greatest American Hero is a superhero drama-comedy. I think that is what has to be kept in mind.....COMEDY.  Ralph Hinckley (played by William Katt) is a ""special ed"" schoolteacher at Whitney High. After coming back from a field trip, the school bus breaks down.  Ralph walks through the desert to get help. While on the road he has an out of control car almost hit him.  The car is being driven by Special FBI Agent Bill Maxwell (played by Robert Culp). Bill Maxwell's character is reminiscent of Culp's role in the 1960s I Spy series. Ralph recognizes him as the guy he and his class ran into earlier in a diner (encounter between Tony and Bill/gun vs. switchblade) Ralph and Bill then are trapped in their car by a space ship and talked to by way of the car radio.  The aliens tell them that they have to work together to save the world. Bill's partner gives them a box, which he puts in the trunk (it's the suit). Bill takes off; Ralph walks back to the bus and loses the instruction manual to the suit along the way.  Ralph has to learn on his own.  He flies through the air flailing his arms and legs, instead of the classic Superman-like ""arms extended, legs together"" pose. In fact, his first flight results in him flying out of control running head first into a wall. Of course the suit has other powers......super strength, invisibility, super speed, X-ray vision etc...  Pam Davidson (played by Connie Sellecca) plays an attorney, Ralph's girlfriend (later wife) also co-starring on the show were Michael Par&eacute; and Faye Grant as two of Ralph's students.The show is quirky and funny and not badly written for the 1980s.  In one episode in the first season (Rosetta Rose) Ralph is called Mr. Hanley throughout the entire show.  This was due to the assassination attempt on President Reagan ......they were going to phase out the name Hinckley and replace it with Hanley.  It is a glaring blunder as on the write up on the outside of the case, he is referred to as Hinckley for that episode.  Also in the Best Desk Scenario, Ralph Hinckley's new office door has the nameplate Ralph Hanley.  There are mistakes, inconsistencies, scenes used over and over, and who cares...  The actors in this are great.  Robert Culp is so believable as an over the top patriotic FBI agent.  William Katt is the perfect humanitarian and reluctant hero.  The two are like Oscar and Felix and play off each other wonderfully! And, Robert Culp's car problems from I-Spy follow him (they get trashed one way or another).Extras include cast interviews..........I think the show is appreciated more after watching the interviews......",5,You can go home again,1169510400,"01 23, 2007",2007,2624,"['Greatest', 'American', 'Hero', 'superhero', 'drama-comedy', 'think', 'be', 'kept', 'mind', '..COMEDY', 'Ralph', 'Hinckley', 'played', 'William', 'Katt', 'special', 'ed', 'schoolteacher', 'Whitney', 'High', 'coming', 'back', 'field', 'trip', 'school', 'bus', 'breaks', 'down', 'Ralph', 'desert', 'get', 'help', 'road', 'control', 'car', 'almost', 'hit', 'car', 'being', 'driven', 'Special', 'FBI', 'Agent', 'Bill', 'Maxwell', 'played', 'Robert', 'Culp', 'Bill', 'Maxwell', 'character', 'reminiscent', 'Culp', 'role', '1960s', 'Spy', 'series', 'Ralph', 'guy', 'class', 'ran', 'earlier', 'diner', 'encounter', 'Tony', 'Bill/gun', 'vs.', 'switchblade', 'Ralph', 'Bill', 'then', 'are', 'trapped', 'car', 'space', 'ship', 'talked', 'way', 'car', 'radio', 'aliens', 'tell', 'have', 'work', 'together', 'save', 'world', 'Bill', 'partner', 'box', 'trunk', 'suit', 'Bill', 'off', 'Ralph', 'back', 'bus', 'instruction', 'manual', 'suit', 'way', 'Ralph', 'learn', 'own', 'air', 'flailing', 'arms', 'legs', 'instead', 'classic', 'Superman-like', 'arms', 'extended', 'legs', 'together', 'pose', 'fact', 'first', 'flight', 'results', 'flying', 'control', 'running', 'head', 'first', 'wall', 'course', 'suit', 'other', 'powers', 'super', 'strength', 'invisibility', 'super', 'speed', 'X-ray', 'vision', 'etc', 'Pam', 'Davidson', 'played', 'Connie', 'Sellecca', 'attorney', 'Ralph', 'girlfriend', 'later', 'wife', 'also', 'co-starring', 'show', 'were', 'Michael', 'Par', 'eacute', 'Faye', 'Grant', 'two', 'Ralph', 'students.The', 'show', 'quirky', 'funny', 'not', 'badly', 'written', '1980s', 'one', 'episode', 'first', 'season', 'Rosetta', 'Rose', 'Ralph', 'called', 'Mr.', 'Hanley', 'entire', 'show', 'was', 'due', 'assassination', 'attempt', 'President', 'Reagan', 'were', 'going', 'phase', 'out', 'name', 'Hinckley', 'replace', 'Hanley', 'glaring', 'blunder', 'write', 'up', 'outside', 'case', 'referred', 'Hinckley', 'episode', 'Also', 'Best', 'Desk', 'Scenario', 'Ralph', 'Hinckley', 'new', 'office', 'door', 'nameplate', 'Ralph', 'Hanley', 'are', 'mistakes', 'inconsistencies', 'scenes', 'used', 'who', 'cares', 'actors', 'are', 'great', 'Robert', 'Culp', 'so', 'believable', 'top', 'patriotic', 'FBI', 'agent', 'William', 'Katt', 'perfect', 'humanitarian', 'reluctant', 'hero', 'two', 'are', 'Oscar', 'Felix', 'play', 'off', 'other', 'wonderfully', 'Robert', 'Culp', 'car', 'problems', 'I-Spy', 'follow', 'get', 'trashed', 'one', 'way', '.Extras', 'include', 'cast', 'interviews', 'think', 'show', 'appreciated', 'more', 'watching', 'interviews']",The Greatest American Hero - Season One

873792,A25UZ7MA72SMKM,B0006SSP9O,Brent Butler,"[1, 1]","""The Greatest American Hero"" gave us a real twist on the super-hero show. William Katt (also known as Paul Drake, Jr. in earlier Perry Mason TV movies) was a school teacher chosen by aliens to receive a ""super suit"" with which to do good deeds. That leads to the second innovation in the series ... he lost the instruction manual. Therefore, throughout the first season he has no idea what the suit will really do. He only learns by accident and trial and error. Leaving clothes behind as he shucks them to reveal the suit and fly away puts pressure on his meager budget. LOLRobert Culp, always entertaining, is perfect as the gung ho FBI agent who finds out about the suit and is determined to help Katt use it to fight crime. His back and forth quips with Katt's semi juvenile delinquent class roster were always amusing. Connie Sellecca was a trendy casting choice in the day because of her beauty, but she delivered solid acting performances, and here she's quite good as Katt's fiance. Her profession in the show is an attorney.The shows have somewhat serious plots dealing with bad guys, but they are all played for laughs as Katt struggles to use the suit and struggles between his anti-establishment penchant and the circumstance that finds him working closely with an FBI agent. The theme song was one of the few TV themes to chart highly as a single.Although the series sort of ran out of steam in the second season, the first season works very well, and we found it to be unforgetable.

873800,A2Z65D8FBYDY63,B0006SSP9O,Donald J. Wurzelbacher,"[39, 42]","If you don't know much about  this particular series, it is not completely surprising.  This series had some rough starts and a rough run overall. The show is about a school teacher named Ralph Hinkley who inherits a super-suit from aliens.  With help from Bill Maxwell, an FBI agent, and his girlfriend Pam Davidson, he is able to use his suit to ""capture the bad guys"" with amazing abilities.The show was intended to be a kind of comic book comedy. Ralph loses the instruction manual when he first receives the suit so he has to figure out how to use it as he goes along. Of course, the flying ability was originally one of the most ""comical"" of his powers.The nice thing about the show was that it is family oriented. There is little to no foul language (Sometimes Ralph and Bill say ""Damn"", but that's about the strongest word in the series) and silly violence when Ralph throws the crooks around.You never know what kind of powers Ralph will inherit from the suit, so anything could happen as the writers went along and continued to think up new ideas on what Ralph could do.There were two big problems about the show. The first was that it became a major target for DC comics Warner Bros to sue over the similarity to Superman. That was an ongoing battle worthy of a comic book story in itself. The other problem was a tragic coincidence. Right when the show was beginning, that was when President Reagan had an attempted assasination by a real life man named ""Hinkley"". So the producer decided to briefly change Ralph's last name to HANLEY. But after a while it went back to HINKLEY. Ralph had some kind of temporary identity crisis.Robert Culp is hilarious as Bill Maxwell and really is the best character on the show. William Katt is your typical American caring JOE ANYONE. Connie Selleca is beautiful even today.The show really didn't last long on the air. the first season was very short. The second season was a full season of episodes. The third season was cancelled halfway through the run. The show was rarely shown in reruns, so many people don't even remember the show anymore. But many people probably still remember the theme song, BELIEVE IT OR NOT because it was a big hit on the radio.

873803,A2HPYTM7DY4KIN,B0006SSP9O,"Eric ""Eric the Dread""","[3, 3]","I loved the Greatest American Hero when it first came out. I was 11 and Superman II had come out that same summer. So I was all superhero'd up that year. Now I loved Superman II that year but the Greatest American Hero used a new and different approach to the super hero genre. Ordinary special ed teacher Ralph Hinkley (William Katt) takes his class to the desert on a field trip when the van mysteriously stops working. He hikes up the road to find help when he runs into FBI agent Bill Maxwell (former 'I Spy' man Robert Culp). He gives Ralph a lift but the car like the van mysteriously shuts off and they are met by an alien space ship (with ""little green guys""). Ralph and Bill are chosen to help make the Earth a better place as Ralph is given a red super suit. Unfortunatly, Bill is spooked by the little green guys and takes off leaving Ralph with the magic ""jammies."" As Ralph is cussing out Bill for leaving him there he drops the instruction book in the desert by the side of the road... So now we have a reluctant super hero who doesn't know how is super suit works. Bill shows back up to help Ralph help him solve his FBI cases. Ralph's divorce lawyer and girlfriend Pam Davidson (Connie Sellecca) also joins their team. A great chemistry between the three as I couldn't wait for every Wednesday night to watch! Was funny to also see the hang up the network had at that time on using the last name Hinkley for our hero. Sounded too much like John Hinckley, the man who shot Ronald Reagan that same year. So for the remainder of the first season Ralph's last name was ""Hanley."" June Lockhart's (Pam's mom)dialogue was edited when they were at the airport. Everytime she said ""Hinkley"" it was muffled by the sounds of jets flying by.While I have all these great memories of the show there are some things they changed. Any song that was a cover was deleted and subbed with an original new song. Ex. ""Rocket Man"" was replaced in the pilot. It wasn't like these were the original artists. They were covered by Mike Post with Joey Scarbury on vocals.The Extras are wonderful as there are interviews with William Katt, Robert Culp, Connie Sellecca, Michael Pare, and creator Stephen J. Cannell. Also featured is the 1986 spin off pilot, the Greatest American Heroine (which never aired) where Ralph becomes a world wide celebrity and is asked by the little green guys to give up the suit to a sucessor. It was neat to watch but it just isn't the same without Ralph, Bill, and the counseller.",5,Finally on DVD!

873809,AMSALM0GG880Q,B0006SSP9O,Hawk911,"[2, 2]","The premise: ABC approaches big time TV producer/writer Stephen J. Cannell (known for car chase/action shows) to create a comedic superhero show with Superman style effects but on a TV budget. The result is one of television's most unsung greats- a show with enormous potential but never fully materialized to it's full ability due to inner struggles within the network top brass and the creaters.Only a comedy on the outside, a deeper look reveals a drama as Ralph, a school teacher for troubled youth (like Welcome back, Kotter) is given a supersuit by aliens and the tremendous responsibility of helping mankind and occassionally saving the world. In addition to that he is teamed up with ""by the book"" FBI agent Maxwell who is his opposite in nearly every aspect.The suit wreaks havoc on his personal life and Ralph struggles with his new-found and forced duties. As any loving american would, when a problem arises and only they can do something about it, the unlikely team does what must be done.From the most basic viewer's standpoint it is a hilarious comedy. Nearly every power of the suit is discovered via a mishap. Ralph constantly crashes into TV antennas and anything else in his path as he ""navigates like hit by a can of Raid"".From a writer's standpoint it's brilliant, chocked full of great dialog and layered elements dealing not only just the crime/action story of the episode but also the human condition.The acting is superb as the viewer can actually feel what Ralph is going through. Robert Culp plays Agent Maxwell so well that he doesn't really seem like he's ""playing"" a character at all, but rather IS Maxwell.The quality of transfer to DVD is excellent. The show looks better than it ever could have during the broadcast days. The only problem I have is the removal of some of the music originally in the show that does detract a bit from it.Some of the effects don't look so good by today's standards but all in all the show still holds up very well. They did very well considering it was a TV show budget and some of the flying scenes are Superman (movie) caliber. Providing ample doses of comedy, action, drama, and effects, the Greatest American Hero is a show I definently recommend checking out. I eagerly await season 2 as it contained some of the best.",5,"""Afterall, a hero's just a man""",1112140800,"03 30, 2005",2005,2288,"['premise', 'ABC', 'big', 'time', 'TV', 'producer/writer', 'Stephen', 'J.', 'Cannell', 'known', 'car', 'chase/action', 'shows', 'create', 'comedic', 'superhero', 'show', 'Superman', 'style', 'effects', 'TV', 'budget', 'result', 'one', 'television', 'most', 'unsung', 'greats-', 'show', 'enormous', 'potential', 'never', 'fully', 'materialized', 'full', 'ability', 'due', 'inner', 'struggles', 'network', 'top', 'brass', 'creaters.Only', 'comedy', 'outside', 'deeper', 'look', 'drama', 'Ralph', 'school', 'teacher', 'troubled', 'youth', 'Welcome', 'back', 'Kotter', 'given', 'supersuit', 'aliens', 'tremendous', 'responsibility', 'helping', 'mankind', 'occassionally', 'saving', 'world', 'addition', 'teamed', 'up', 'book', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Maxwell', 'who', 'opposite', 'nearly', 'aspect.The', 'suit', 'havoc', 'personal', 'life', 'Ralph', 'new-found', 'forced', 'duties', 'loving', 'american', 'would', 'when', 'problem', 'only', 'can', 'do', 'something', 'unlikely', 'team', 'what', 'must', 'be', 'done.From', 'most', 'basic', 'viewer', 'standpoint', 'hilarious', 'comedy', 'Nearly', 'power', 'suit', 'discovered', 'mishap', 'Ralph', 'constantly', 'TV', 'antennas', 'anything', 'else', 'path', 'hit', 'can', 'Raid', 'writer', 'standpoint', 'brilliant', 'chocked', 'full', 'great', 'dialog', 'layered', 'elements', 'dealing', 'not', 'only', 'just', 'crime/action', 'story', 'episode', 'also', 'human', 'condition.The', 'acting', 'superb', 'viewer', 'can', 'actually', 'feel', 'what', 'Ralph', 'going', 'Robert', 'Culp', 'Agent', 'Maxwell', 'so', 'well', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'playing', 'character', 'rather', 'IS', 'Maxwell.The', 'quality', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'show', 'better', 'ever', 'could', 'have', 'broadcast', 'days', 'only', 'problem', 'have', 'removal', 'music', 'originally', 'show', 'detract', 'bit', 'it.Some', 'effects', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'so', 'good', 'today', 'standards', 'show', 'still', 'up', 'very', 'well', 'did', 'very', 'well', 'considering', 'was', 'TV', 'show', 'budget', 'flying', 'scenes', 'are', 'Superman', 'movie', 'caliber', 'Providing', 'ample', 'doses', 'comedy', 'action', 'drama', 'effects', 'Greatest', 'American', 'Hero', 'show', 'definently', 'recommend', 'checking', 'out', 'eagerly', 'await', 'season', '2', 'contained', 'best']",The Greatest American Hero - Season One
873810,A3N0AXNEZVE686,B0006SSP9O,Hound Dog,"[3, 3]","Having the wonderful opportunity to view this long-departed series' first season on DVD is well worth the price of admission.Nearly 25 years ago, Stephen J. Cannell produced the offbeat superheroic satire, ""The Greatest American Hero,"" which holds up surprisngly well today in terms of its storylines, acting, and special effects. In fact, ""Hero"" may well be Cannell's most underrated (and most exuberant) series he has ever produced.The series premise: Ralph Hinkley (William Katt) is a young, idealistic high school special ed. teacher who reluctantly fights the good fight for the good ol' USA using a ""super-suit"" (complete with red leotards and a blue cape) bequeathed to him by a mysterious alien race.  Ralph's first major problem is that he loses the instruction book to the suit, so he will have have to learn how to use his extraordinary new powers all on his own.Aided by sardonic FBI agent Bill Maxwell (Robert Culp) and Ralph's girlfriend/attorney, Pamela Davidson (Connie Selleca), bumbling Ralph learns the ropes about saving the world while attempting to keep his career and personal life reasonably normal.  Yet, much like his inept flying efforts, Ralph won't find this task easy and will continually question why the aliens chose him.  Hence, the lyrics from the show's hit theme song ""Believe it or Not"" summarize Ralph's ambivalent feelings superbly.The DVD Edition:Disc 1 Episodes:1. ""The Greatest American Hero"" (pilot): 5 *****2. ""The Hit Car"": 4 1/2 ****3. ""Here's Looking at You, Kid"": 4 1/2 ****Disc 2 Episodes:1. ""Saturday Night on Sunset Boulevard"": 4 1/2 ****2.

""The Greatest American Heroine"": 2 1/2 **Overall, excellent!  There really isn't a weak link in Season One.  The feature-length pilot episode and ""My Heroes Have Always Been Cowboys,"" (featuring a cameo appearance by ex-""Lone Ranger"" star John Hart) are probably the best among them.  Further, the product's packaging clearly identifies each episode's plot, including a neat instruction booklet providing info and fun trivia questions about the series.Among the special features on Disc 3 are lengthy interview segments with Stephen J. Cannell, William Katt, Robert Culp, Connie Sellecca, and Michael Pare (who portrayed one of Ralph's rebellious students).  Each of them share some intriguing insights and anecdotes about their participation throughout the show's three-year run, and why the show deserves to be fondly remembered.An added bonus feature is the unaired ""Greatest American Heroine"" one-shot episode, which features Ralph and Pam's exit from the series while Bill is left resigned to groom Ralph's energetic heir to the ""super-suit.""  Unfortunately, watching ""Heroine"" will remind you why the Katt / Selleca /Culp trio gave the original series the magical chemistry it deserved, and that substituting someone else for Ralph simply doesn't work in this unique formula.For what it is worth, we highly recommend Season One of ""The Greatest American Hero"" for audiences of all ages!",5,Greatest American Hero Season One: Believe It or Not!,1117670400,"06 2, 2005",2005,3131,"['Having', 'wonderful', 'opportunity', 'view', 'long-departed', 'series', 'first', 'season', 'DVD', 'well', 'price', 'admission.Nearly', '25', 'years', 'ago', 'Stephen', 'J.', 'Cannell', 'produced', 'offbeat', 'superheroic', 'satire', 'Greatest', 'American', 'Hero', 'up', 'surprisngly', 'well', 'today', 'terms', 'storylines', 'acting', 'special', 'effects', 'fact', 'Hero', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'Cannell', 'most', 'underrated', 'most', 'exuberant', 'series', 'ever', 'produced.The', 'series', 'premise', 'Ralph', 'Hinkley', 'William', 'Katt', 'young', 'idealistic', 'high', 'school', 'special', 'ed', 'teacher', 'who', 'reluctantly', 'good', 'fight', 'good', 'ol', 'USA', 'using', 'super-suit', 'complete', 'red', 'leotards', 'blue', 'cape', 'bequeathed', 'mysterious', 'alien', 'race', 'Ralph', 'first', 'major', 'problem', 'instruction', 'book', 'suit', 'will', 'have', 'have', 'learn', 'how', 'use', 'extraordinary', 'new', 'powers', 'own.Aided', 'sardonic', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Bill', 'Maxwell', 'Robert', 'Culp', 'Ralph', 'girlfriend/attorney', 'Pamela', 'Davidson', 'Connie', 'Selleca', 'bumbling', 'Ralph', 'ropes', 'saving', 'world', 'attempting', 'keep', 'career', 'personal', 'life', 'reasonably', 'normal', 'much', 'inept', 'flying', 'efforts', 'Ralph', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'task', 'easy', 'will', 'continually', 'question', 'why', 'aliens', 'chose', 'Hence', 'lyrics', 'show', 'hit', 'theme', 'song', 'Believe', 'Not', 'summarize', 'Ralph', 'ambivalent', 'feelings', 'superbly.The', 'DVD', 'Edition', 'Disc', '1', 'Episodes:1', 'Greatest', 'American', 'Hero', 'pilot', '5', '*****2', 'Hit', 'Car', '4', '1/2', '****3', 'Here', 'Looking', 'Kid', '4', '1/2', '****Disc', '2', 'Episodes:1', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Sunset', 'Boulevard', '4', '1/2', '****2', 'Reseda', 'Rose', '4', '1/2', '****3', 'Heroes', 'Have', 'Always', 'Been', 'Cowboys', '5', '3', 'Episodes:1', 'Fireman', '4', '****2', 'Best', 'Desk', 'Scenario', '4', '****3', 'Greatest', 'American', 'Heroine', '2', '1/2', '**Overall', 'excellent', 'really', ""n't"", 'weak', 'link', 'Season', 'One', 'feature-length', 'pilot', 'episode', 'Heroes', 'Have', 'Always', 'Been', 'Cowboys', 'featuring', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'ex-', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'star', 'John', 'Hart', 'are', 'probably', 'best', 'Further', 'product', 'packaging', 'clearly', 'episode', 'plot', 'including', 'neat', 'instruction', 'booklet', 'providing', 'info', 'fun', 'trivia', 'questions', 'series.Among', 'special', 'features', 'Disc', '3', 'are', 'lengthy', 'interview', 'segments', 'Stephen', 'J.', 'Cannell', 'William', 'Katt', 'Robert', 'Culp', 'Connie', 'Sellecca', 'Michael', 'Pare', 'who', 'portrayed', 'one', 'Ralph', 'rebellious', 'students', 'share', 'intriguing', 'insights', 'anecdotes', 'participation', 'show', 'three-year', 'run', 'why', 'show', 'be', 'fondly', 'added', 'bonus', 'feature', 'unaired', 'Greatest', 'American', 'Heroine', 'one-shot', 'episode', 'Ralph', 'Pam', 'exit', 'series', 'Bill', 'left', 'resigned', 'groom', 'Ralph', 'energetic', 'heir', 'super-suit', 'Unfortunately', 'watching', 'Heroine', 'will', 'remind', 'why', 'Katt', '/', 'Selleca', '/Culp', 'trio', 'gave', 'original', 'series', 'magical', 'chemistry', 'deserved', 'substituting', 'someone', 'else', 'Ralph', 'simply', ""n't"", 'work', 'unique', 'what', 'worth', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Season', 'One', 'Greatest', 'American', 'Hero', 'audiences', 'ages']",The Greatest American Hero - Season One

My video tape recordings have not held up well over these many years.  I just hope they don't do what was done to Quantum Leap season 2, taking out the pop songs that were a part of the show.  Maybe since Joey Scarbury sang the songs, such as Rocket Man and Eve of Destruction, they won't have to deal with copyright laws.  For those of you who don't know the story of Ralph Hinkley and Bill Maxwell, you are in for a treat.  Ralph was a teacher for troubled high school kids.  On his first day he decides to take them on a field trip to the desert.  The school bus stops at a roadside diner, where we meet FBI agent Maxwell.  Bill and the troubled youth Tony (played perfectly by a very young Michael Pare) have an altercation that results in one drawing his gun and the other his switchblade, respectively.  Then it's off to the desert, and a close encounter with the ""little green guys"".  Ralph and Bill are told that the Earth is racing toward destruction, and it needs a protector.  Ralph is given a special suit that only works on him.  It gives him super powers, such as flight, invisibility, super-strength.  It would do a whole lot more, except Ralph loses the instruction book.  Also starring the beautiful Contessa Selleca, aka Connie Selleca, as Ralph's lawyer girlfriend, this comedy/action/drama was waaaaay ahead of its time.  It only ran for three seasons, which is probably a good thing, because that way it didn't burn itself out as many other longer-running tv shows did.

873815,A2KU5RUDF2VO80,B0006SSP9O,J. Kenney,"[11, 14]","The third and final season of this interesting, likeable, but seriously flawed and troubled production has a lot of hostility towards it in certain quarters, but on the whole, its ratio of good episodes to duds is about average for the show, which was always hit & miss in its constant struggle to define itself as a show for adults (what Cannell and the cast wanted) or a show for kids (which the network wanted), and in its production values (often over-budget, the show's production values can veer wildly from episode to episode and scene to scene).  I'd say two thirds of these are pretty fun, a third are kinda screwy, but for me, even the 2nd season was spotty in the same way...The 3rd season actually has the best flying footage, they figured out a more efficient way to do it and finally stopped using the same stock footage shot from the pilot that kept reappearing in the first and second season.  They also dumped the students (Michael Pare & Faye Grant) for a more generic crowd, save the loyal and hard-working Don Cervantes.  This leads to some rather old and characterless students in Hinkley's class, but allows for the producers to not have to shoehorn them into episodes where they don't belong as much as in season two, for example.The show really works in the 3rd season, cuz of the reason it worked the first two; Katt, Culp and Selleca were a great team, deserved better scripts than they usually got, and did the most with what they had.  If you like them, you'll like the show.  They're just as good here as ever, and it is nice that Ralph and Pam finally make it official in this season...Plus, the final episode ever is the oddball ""Vanity Says the Preacher,"" written and directed by Culp.  It's kind of a mess, but very similar in tone and spirit to many of the great episodes he wrote for I SPY -- it's just that the budget wasn't there to do the episode ""right,""; but Culp fans will recognize the spirit and attitude in it, and it's worth a viewing, particularly since it never aired in the show's original network run.",4,Odd final season,1123200000,"08 5, 2005",2005,2050,"['third', 'final', 'season', 'interesting', 'likeable', 'seriously', 'flawed', 'troubled', 'production', 'lot', 'hostility', 'towards', 'certain', 'quarters', 'whole', 'ratio', 'good', 'episodes', 'duds', 'average', 'show', 'was', 'always', 'hit', 'miss', 'constant', 'struggle', 'define', 'show', 'adults', 'what', 'Cannell', 'cast', 'wanted', 'show', 'kids', 'network', 'wanted', 'production', 'values', 'often', 'over-budget', 'show', 'production', 'values', 'can', 'veer', 'wildly', 'episode', 'episode', 'scene', 'scene', ""'d"", 'say', 'two', 'thirds', 'are', 'pretty', 'fun', 'third', 'are', 'kinda', 'screwy', 'even', '2nd', 'season', 'was', 'spotty', 'same', 'way', '3rd', 'season', 'actually', 'best', 'flying', 'footage', 'figured', 'out', 'more', 'efficient', 'way', 'do', 'finally', 'stopped', 'using', 'same', 'stock', 'footage', 'shot', 'pilot', 'kept', 'reappearing', 'first', 'second', 'season', 'also', 'dumped', 'students', 'Michael', 'Pare', 'Faye', 'Grant', 'more', 'generic', 'crowd', 'save', 'loyal', 'hard-working', 'Don', 'Cervantes', 'rather', 'old', 'characterless', 'students', 'Hinkley', 'class', 'producers', 'not', 'have', 'shoehorn', 'episodes', 'where', 'do', ""n't"", 'belong', 'as', 'much', 'season', 'two', 'example.The', 'show', 'really', '3rd', 'season', 'cuz', 'reason', 'worked', 'first', 'two', 'Katt', 'Culp', 'Selleca', 'were', 'great', 'team', 'deserved', 'better', 'scripts', 'usually', 'got', 'did', 'most', 'what', 'had', 'like', ""'ll"", 'like', 'show', ""'re"", 'just', 'as', 'good', 'here', 'ever', 'nice', 'Ralph', 'Pam', 'finally', 'make', 'official', 'season', 'final', 'episode', 'ever', 'oddball', 'Vanity', 'Preacher', 'written', 'directed', 'Culp', 'kind', 'mess', 'very', 'similar', 'tone', 'spirit', 'many', 'great', 'episodes', 'wrote', 'SPY', 'just', 'budget', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', 'do', 'episode', 'right', 'Culp', 'fans', 'will', 'recognize', 'spirit', 'attitude', 'viewing', 'particularly', 'never', 'aired', 'show', 'original', 'network', 'run']",The Greatest American Hero - Season One

Joey Scarbury sang the show's classic soft rock theme song 'Believe It or Not'. George from Seinfeld(1989-1999) sang a spoof of it for his answering machine. William Katt(from 1976's Carrie) plays mild mannered teacher Ralph Hinkley. He tries to be patient with a class of misfit students just like in To Sir With Love(1967). Aliens from outer space give Ralph a red/black suit with superpowers and he's ordered to work with FBI Agent Bill Maxwell(Robert Culp). It's an homage to Close Encounters of the Third Kind(1977) and Superman(1978). Ralph dates a lovely, raven black haired lawyer called Pam Davidson(Connie Selleca). I like the look on Pam's face when she first sees Ralph in the ""supersuit"". She thinks that he's lost his sanity. The Greatest American Hero pokes fun of superhero cliches and it's packed with robust heroics. The show's stunts, action scenes, and visual effects are solid considering the show's limited budget. For an entire season, Ralph's surname was changed from Hinkley to ""Hanley"" after some guy tried to assassinate President Reagan. There was a spin off pilot called The Greatest American Heroine. It was reedited and shown in syndication with the rest of this show. The music on this show was quite good. There are rumors that a Greatest American Hero movie is in the works.

I understand the dissapointment of many fans that the soundtrack as been changed. However I also realize that its not always up to the company (Anchor Bay) concerning what they have liscense to add to a DVD. I'm just glad that they found a way to release it in the first place. I remember watching this show as a child and never understood why it was gone so quickly. More resently I've learned of the issues with Hinckley/Hanley (that i failed to notice as a child). As well as the issue with Warner Brothers  (who have no concept of what DVD content should be) & DC comics concerning the alleged Superman concept rip off. I mean come on....Superman & Hinckley.....lol. He would have been more of a Clark Kent rip off if you ask me. On to my point. At the time of this review S2 is only getting 2 1/2 out of five stars. I know this is a show that most of the negative reviewers loved & understand they are reviewing the quality of this release and not the actual show. However you must understand that overall it is the show that is getting the less than deserved rating. Please people, rate the Show first...then put any notes about DVD quality in your review.

It packs a LOT of stuff into a 1 hour show. The main theme is Ralph, Bill and the Suit. Ralph wants to give it up; he strips it off, hands it to Bill and walks off. A few moments later Bill is in danger and Ralph runs back to help him. Does he forget he doesn't have the suit on or is it simply because Bill's his best friend?

Ordered the first season, which includes the pilot, but was very disappointed in the quality of the DVD. Though the picture is excellent and the sound ok for a show that is like 25 years old, the DVD started to freeze about 10 minutes into the first disc. It kept getting worse after that and it was kind of tough to follow the story. Returned it to Amazon for a replacement, which I received less than a week later (great service, like always). The second shipment was a bit better, at least through the pilot. Only froze twice. Yet the next episode was always impossible to watch due to the same problems. Don't feel like returning this one so I ordered the Complete Series in hopes the recordings will be better. As the price on these DVDs is really low I feel it's worth taking another chance.

873828,A1R283L4SH4UP8,B0006SSP9O,Magpie,"[10, 14]","This review is aimed at the complaints that have dogged the release of this show on DVD, specifically the omission of the cover songs by Joey Scarbury.First of all, the picture and sound quality remastered for these DVDs are excellent. Real care was taken with the presentation of these episodes. The Greatest American Hero was not a huge television phenomenon, but it does have a very strong cult following (that I am a part of), so the fact that Anchor Bay took it on and released it amazes me, though they are known for their catalog of cult faves. This is the first time the show has ever been released in any format, and it hasn't run in any form of syndication for years, as far as I know. In essence, the show was over.When I was a kid, I would tape the episodes' music on blank cassette tapes, which I still have, so Scarbury's music is very important to my memory of the show.But here's a dose of reality to the naysayers. This DVD set would have had a budget, and most likely not a very huge one due to the very questionable profit margin this show could generate. This is not Miami Vice, or The Cosby Show, or even The Brady Bunch, this was a small show, so it most likely had a small budget. So Anchor Bay gives this budget to the producers and the producers have to decide where best to put the money for a proper release. Well, the rights to the cover songs, as you probably have guessed, have slightly skyrocketed since 1981. So, picture this, you can either put a large chunk of your budget towards a top-notch remastering job (I once watched a tape of the pilot at the Museum of Television and Radio, and it was a pretty terrible copy, I can only imagine what the source tapes are like, but it had all the original music (!)) or you can exhaust your funds towards paying off the huge cost of licensing and not have much left over for remastering it properly. The third option is not releasing the show at all. I, myself, am happy to have the show released and understand the financial dilemma the producers of the DVD were most likely facing. Again, I'm quite sure that the producers did not have the budget Universal gave the producers for Miami Vice, which was a sure thing in terms of turning over a profit. Miami Vice had the luxury of paying million of dollars to the licensors to make sure each and every song was kept. I'm sure The Greatest American Hero did not.That said, Anchor Bay's biggest screw-up was the lack of a disclaimer on the DVD box claiming that some music has been altered, and they should be held accountable for that as it is false advertising. It is my hope that future DVD or even HD pressings of this show, after it has shown a significant profit, will have the original music re-inserted, but who knows? All of Joey Scarbury's original music has not been touched, however, and is present on the DVD sets.Please also keep in mind that The Greatest American Hero is at least fifteen dollars cheaper than Miami Vice with more discs, and don't even get me started on how much HBO charges for their DVD sets with very few extras.I give four stars for the overall presentation of the set, with one omitted for the missing songs but most of all to false advertising. For those of you foaming at the mouth and expect millions of dollars to be thrown at your favorite TV show without a thought as to what cost vs return means, please take a moment to at least be thankful that the show got released at all, and most of all, get a grip on reality.",4,A DOSE OF REALITY,1113004800,"04 9, 2005",2005,3484,"['review', 'aimed', 'complaints', 'have', 'dogged', 'release', 'show', 'DVD', 'specifically', 'omission', 'cover', 'songs', 'Joey', 'Scarbury.First', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'remastered', 'DVDs', 'are', 'excellent', 'Real', 'care', 'was', 'taken', 'presentation', 'episodes', 'Greatest', 'American', 'Hero', 'was', 'not', 'huge', 'television', 'phenomenon', 'have', 'very', 'strong', 'cult', 'following', 'am', 'part', 'fact', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'took', 'released', 'are', 'known', 'catalog', 'cult', 'faves', 'first', 'time', 'show', 'ever', 'been', 'released', 'format', ""n't"", 'run', 'form', 'syndication', 'years', 'as', 'far', 'know', 'essence', 'show', 'was', 'over.When', 'was', 'kid', 'would', 'tape', 'episodes', 'music', 'blank', 'cassette', 'tapes', 'still', 'have', 'Scarbury', 'music', 'very', 'important', 'memory', 'show.But', 'here', 'dose', 'reality', 'naysayers', 'DVD', 'set', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'budget', 'most', 'likely', 'not', 'very', 'huge', 'one', 'due', 'very', 'questionable', 'profit', 'margin', 'show', 'could', 'generate', 'not', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'even', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'was', 'small', 'show', 'most', 'likely', 'had', 'small', 'budget', 'So', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'budget', 'producers', 'producers', 'have', 'decide', 'where', 'best', 'put', 'money', 'proper', 'release', 'Well', 'rights', 'cover', 'songs', 'probably', 'have', 'guessed', 'have', 'slightly', 'skyrocketed', '1981', 'So', 'picture', 'can', 'either', 'put', 'large', 'chunk', 'budget', 'top-notch', 'remastering', 'job', 'once', 'watched', 'tape', 'pilot', 'Museum', 'Television', 'Radio', 'was', 'pretty', 'terrible', 'copy', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'what', 'source', 'tapes', 'are', 'had', 'original', 'music', 'can', 'exhaust', 'funds', 'towards', 'paying', 'off', 'huge', 'cost', 'licensing', 'not', 'have', 'much', 'left', 'over', 'remastering', 'properly', 'third', 'option', 'not', 'releasing', 'show', 'am', 'happy', 'have', 'show', 'released', 'understand', 'financial', 'dilemma', 'producers', 'DVD', 'were', 'most', 'likely', 'facing', 'Again', ""'m"", 'quite', 'sure', 'producers', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'budget', 'Universal', 'gave', 'producers', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'was', 'sure', 'thing', 'terms', 'turning', 'over', 'profit', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'had', 'luxury', 'paying', 'million', 'dollars', 'licensors', 'make', 'sure', 'song', 'was', 'kept', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Greatest', 'American', 'Hero', 'did', 'said', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'biggest', 'screw-up', 'was', 'lack', 'disclaimer', 'DVD', 'box', 'claiming', 'music', 'been', 'altered', 'should', 'be', 'held', 'accountable', 'false', 'advertising', 'hope', 'future', 'DVD', 'even', 'HD', 'pressings', 'show', 'shown', 'significant', 'profit', 'will', 'have', 'original', 'music', 're-inserted', 'who', 'Joey', 'Scarbury', 'original', 'music', 'not', 'been', 'touched', 'however', 'present', 'DVD', 'sets.Please', 'also', 'keep', 'mind', 'Greatest', 'American', 'Hero', 'least', 'fifteen', 'dollars', 'cheaper', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'more', 'discs', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'started', 'how', 'much', 'HBO', 'charges', 'DVD', 'sets', 'very', 'few', 'extras.I', 'give', 'four', 'stars', 'overall', 'presentation', 'set', 'one', 'omitted', 'missing', 'songs', 'most', 'false', 'advertising', 'foaming', 'mouth', 'expect', 'millions', 'dollars', 'be', 'thrown', 'favorite', 'TV', 'show', 'thought', 'what', 'cost', 'vs', 'return', 'please', 'take', 'moment', 'least', 'be', 'thankful', 'show', 'got', 'released', 'most', 'get', 'grip', 'reality']",The Greatest American Hero - Season One
873829,AFYEV6ZSTIWD7,B0006SSP9O,malexandria,"[2, 6]","From [...]The Greatest American HeroLook at what's happened to me, I can't believe it myself. Suddenly I'm up on top of the world, It should've been somebody else.  Believe it or not, I'm walking on air. I never thought I could feel so free eee eee. Flying away on a wing and a prayer. Who could it be? Believe it or not it's just me.The opening paragraph to this review is taken from one the greatest television theme songs of all time, ""The Greatest American Hero."" The song perfectly sets the tone and mood for what is one of the great unsung shows of all time.  GAH deftly weaved sly humor, satire and standard super hero drama into one unique package.In this show Ralph Hinkley (William Katt) is a mild mannered school teacher who is stuck teaching a bunch of troubled students, on his second day in the classroom he decides to try and bond with his students by taking them out on a field trip to the desert, when the school bus break down he goes for a walk to seek help. He comes across FBI Agent Bill Maxwell (Robert Culp) who is also having car trouble.  While arguing with each other a Spaceship appears out of sky, the aliens tell the two that they have been chosen to save the world.  Ralph is given a suit that gives him special powers, unfortunately he loses the instructions and he and Maxwell have to learn what the suit is capable of.Everything about the pilot clicks right away, the chemistry between Bill and Ralph is spot on perfect, when you add Ralph's lawyer girlfriend Pam (Connie Sellecca) and the students headed up by Michael Pare, and Faye Grant the sparks start flying.  During the first season this weird cocktail made for fun character moments - like the classic handshake where Ralph accidentally breaks Bill's hand, or whenever Bill and Pam get into arguments about Bill's sexist views, all classic moments.The other funny thing was how the producers couldn't decide what Ralph's last name was going to be, for the first 3 - 5 episodes his name last name was Hinkley, then for some unknown reason they changed it to Hanley for the last 3 episodes of season one.  But on ""The Greatest American Heroine"" pilot it's changed back to Hinkley.Final Grade ADVD FEATURESI did not realize that the first season of the show was so short.  I was disappointed when I found out that there were only eight original season one episodes.  The good thing is, all of the season one episodes are terrific and appear to be uncut. The set includes the original two hour pilot and for snicks it also includes the one hr pilot for the proposed spin-off ""The Greatest American Heroine."" Let me just say, that pilot was HORRIBLE.  In many ways this is why TV Shows on DVD is a fantastic concept.  This is one of those shows that I had fond memories of and has not worn out its welcome through ""over syndication."" In fact I don't remember this show ever airing again after it's initial first several years of post television cancellation. I'm surprised a channel like Sci-Fi hasn't aired reruns.The DVD set is real lean on extras, there are no episode specific commentary tracks, but there is about 75 minutes worth of new interviews with Stephen J. Cannell, William Katt, Robert Culp, Connie Sellecca, and Michael Pare each talking about 15 - 19 minutes about their experiences.  In a cute moment they had Connie interview Michael.  There seemed to be genuine like there. It was good to see that after 23 years they were still obviously good friends.  The cast has aged gracefully, Sellecca, Cannell, Culp and Pare all look pretty much the same, Katt looks tired.The quality of the transfer was interesting. The first five episodes are clean, crisp and color corrected.  But episodes six - eight include some fuzziness and blemishes where things get out of focused and duo toned for a few seconds. While the pilot for ""Greatest American Heroine"" looks really bad.  The audio is in Dolby Digital Stereo, and is pretty sharp. I particularly like the menu screens, they include the theme song playing in the background, with nice full motion video.  The menu text fonts are clear and easily readable.  As for the packaging the case cover is beautiful, and instead of the annoying fold out disks, the set comes with two slip case disks that are easy to pull out and put away. This DVD gets extra points for taking the time and effort to include all the original music from the series. I adore the music in GAH, and it's nice that all of it is still intact.  You hear that Fox??????!! I won't go into my ""Roswell"" was butchered on DVD rant here.DVD Extras Grade BFINAL THOUGHTSWhen they announced that this series was coming to television, I feared that it wouldn't hold up, that maybe my memory of the show was fuzzy. The one thing that was consistent was how that theme song has always stayed with me, for the last three months it's been stuck in my head and won't go away. It's hard to believe this series is 23 years old. Sometimes it doesn't pay to go back and relive your childhood (I still shudder and can't believe how much I loved Ultraman or Johnny Socko), not in this case, I was blown away and surprised by how well the special effects and stories hold up - the fashions are a little questionable, but it's not as bad as a lot of 70s television. ""The Greatest American Hero"" has aged gracefully. It is truly a classic and a must own DVD.FINAL OVERALL GRADE AGREATEST AMERICAN HERO ORIGINAL THEME SONG LYRICSLook at what's happened to me,I can't believe it myself.Suddenly I'm up on top of the

873831,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,B0006SSP9O,Mark Baker,"[17, 19]","""The Greatest American Hero"" is a short-lived superhero comedy show from the early 80's about a teacher (William Katt) who is given a super suit by space aliens.  Each week, he must team up with his girlfriend (Connie Sellecca) and a FBI agent (Robert Culp) to save the world as we know it.  The problem?  He lost the instruction book, so he has no clue what all he can do and how to control it.The show only had one full season and this is it.  22 full episodes to be enjoyed.  Connie Sellecca is missing from five of the episodes near the beginning because she was having her first child.  This leaves a hole because I find the show is strongest while focusing on the interactions of the three leads.  Once she's back, the show begins to pick up steam and it gets better as it goes along.Yes, the show is cheesy at times.  Yes, the special effects are obviously low budget for 20 years ago.  Do I care?  Nope!  We've got entertaining stories and great characters.  What else do I need?I realized while watching this set just how little I remember about specific episodes.  Honestly, it was like watching a new show for me.  Which is one reason why any changes to the music for copyright reasons didn't bothered me.  I'm sure if I knew the show, these changes would be a problem, but I didn't notice at all.This set includes six discs.  The episodes look good for their age, although effects shots and stock footage are often worse.  The sound won't challenge your system any, but it gets the job done.  Extras include interviews with creator Stephen J. Cannell and composer Mike Post.  These cover their careers and, while entertaining, don't add much to a discussion of this show.  Also included are a photo gallery and the screenplay and a Japanese language track for the season premier.This show can have me laughing at the banter between characters one minute (there are some great one-liners) and worried about how they'll get out of the mess they're in the next.  I'm glad it came out on DVD at all so I can enjoy it for years to come.",5,The Only Full Season of an Entertaining Show,1118707200,"06 14, 2005",2005,2043,"['Greatest', 'American', 'Hero', 'short-lived', 'superhero', 'comedy', 'show', 'early', '80', 'teacher', 'William', 'Katt', 'who', 'given', 'super', 'suit', 'space', 'aliens', 'week', 'must', 'team', 'up', 'girlfriend', 'Connie', 'Sellecca', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Robert', 'Culp', 'save', 'world', 'know', 'problem', 'lost', 'instruction', 'book', 'clue', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'how', 'control', 'it.The', 'show', 'only', 'had', 'one', 'full', 'season', '22', 'full', 'episodes', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'Connie', 'Sellecca', 'missing', 'five', 'episodes', 'beginning', 'was', 'having', 'first', 'child', 'hole', 'find', 'show', 'strongest', 'focusing', 'interactions', 'three', 'leads', 'back', 'show', 'pick', 'up', 'steam', 'better', 'along.Yes', 'show', 'cheesy', 'times', 'Yes', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'obviously', 'low', 'budget', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'Do', 'care', 'Nope', ""'ve"", 'got', 'entertaining', 'stories', 'great', 'characters', 'What', 'else', 'do', 'need', 'realized', 'watching', 'set', 'just', 'how', 'little', 'remember', 'specific', 'episodes', 'Honestly', 'was', 'watching', 'new', 'show', 'Which', 'one', 'reason', 'why', 'changes', 'music', 'copyright', 'reasons', 'did', ""n't"", 'bothered', ""'m"", 'sure', 'knew', 'show', 'changes', 'would', 'be', 'problem', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'all.This', 'set', 'six', 'discs', 'episodes', 'look', 'good', 'age', 'effects', 'shots', 'stock', 'footage', 'are', 'often', 'worse', 'sound', 'wo', ""n't"", 'challenge', 'system', 'job', 'done', 'Extras', 'include', 'interviews', 'creator', 'Stephen', 'J.', 'Cannell', 'composer', 'Mike', 'Post', 'cover', 'careers', 'entertaining', 'do', ""n't"", 'add', 'much', 'discussion', 'show', 'Also', 'included', 'are', 'photo', 'gallery', 'screenplay', 'Japanese', 'language', 'track', 'season', 'premier.This', 'show', 'can', 'have', 'laughing', 'banter', 'characters', 'one', 'minute', 'are', 'great', 'one-liners', 'worried', 'how', ""'ll"", 'get', 'mess', ""'re"", 'next', ""'m"", 'glad', 'came', 'out', 'DVD', 'so', 'can', 'enjoy', 'years', 'come']",The Greatest American Hero - Season One
873832,A1BR1Q63132DWG,B0006SSP9O,Mark's Amazon,"[0, 0]","I loved the show as a kid and still enjoyed it as an adult at 39.Of the reviews I read, this video by Anchor Bay with this cover is the one to get. Or, supposedly, a Japanese  version has ALL of the original music but, I could not find one. I personally don't see how anyone can remember al of the exact songs and realize they were changed.There are a few good episodes on season 2, but as mentioned in some bonus commentaries (I think in season 1), the stories were getting worse and way too cheesy with sea monsters, weird aliens, and ghosts. That seems like a weird comment given the story about a super hero with an alien suit, but even for this show the stories were lacking the originality and capability and just out of place.Season two also accelerated the use of the powers of the suit without letting the viewers see Ralph discovering them which was part of the charm of the original story. All of the sudden he has two or more powers he is familiar with.Some of the stories/episodes seemed way too short and they were setting the show up to end already in this season, talking about other heroes and everyone discovering Ralph with the suit, among other things. I guess that is bound to happen with a super hero without a mask.According to the writers and actors commentaries the extra cheesiness of the new aliens, monsters, and ghosts was the reason the series ended. They said it was the direction the execs wanted them to go and the morons ruined it. There was so much potential to keep to the original story about a regular guy dealing with the gift of a goofy suit in a somewhat realistic world and how people would really react.The movie case/booklet design on this one is pretty nice too. There are 3 individual cases which can hold 2 dvds each and they are stored in a outer case.They reused a lot of footage like a merry go round of jumping, flying, and landing which got a bit too boring, but I found it kind of fun to watch for the wires and the stunt man which did not take much to notice.Not so sure if I want season 3 now mostly because of the stories going downhill and the prices for season 3 are nearly 3 times more $. I'll have to read up on more reviews and think about it. I'll likely buy it since I like the show and want to see more.",3,cheesier than Season 1,1360540800,"02 11, 2013",2013,2267,"['loved', 'show', 'kid', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'adult', '39.Of', 'reviews', 'read', 'video', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'cover', 'one', 'get', 'supposedly', 'Japanese', 'version', 'original', 'music', 'could', 'not', 'find', 'one', 'personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'anyone', 'can', 'remember', 'al', 'exact', 'songs', 'realize', 'were', 'changed.There', 'are', 'few', 'good', 'episodes', 'season', '2', 'as', 'mentioned', 'bonus', 'commentaries', 'think', 'season', '1', 'stories', 'were', 'getting', 'worse', 'way', 'too', 'cheesy', 'sea', 'monsters', 'weird', 'aliens', 'ghosts', 'weird', 'comment', 'given', 'story', 'super', 'hero', 'alien', 'suit', 'even', 'show', 'stories', 'were', 'lacking', 'originality', 'capability', 'just', 'place.Season', 'two', 'also', 'accelerated', 'use', 'powers', 'suit', 'letting', 'viewers', 'see', 'Ralph', 'discovering', 'was', 'part', 'charm', 'original', 'story', 'sudden', 'two', 'more', 'powers', 'familiar', 'with.Some', 'stories/episodes', 'seemed', 'way', 'too', 'short', 'were', 'setting', 'show', 'up', 'end', 'already', 'season', 'talking', 'other', 'heroes', 'everyone', 'discovering', 'Ralph', 'suit', 'other', 'things', 'guess', 'bound', 'happen', 'super', 'hero', 'mask.According', 'writers', 'actors', 'extra', 'cheesiness', 'new', 'aliens', 'monsters', 'ghosts', 'was', 'reason', 'series', 'ended', 'said', 'was', 'direction', 'execs', 'wanted', 'go', 'morons', 'ruined', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'keep', 'original', 'story', 'regular', 'guy', 'dealing', 'gift', 'goofy', 'suit', 'somewhat', 'realistic', 'world', 'how', 'people', 'would', 'really', 'react.The', 'movie', 'case/booklet', 'design', 'one', 'pretty', 'nice', 'too', 'are', '3', 'individual', 'cases', 'can', 'hold', '2', 'dvds', 'are', 'stored', 'outer', 'case.They', 'reused', 'lot', 'footage', 'merry', 'go', 'round', 'jumping', 'flying', 'landing', 'got', 'bit', 'too', 'boring', 'found', 'kind', 'fun', 'watch', 'wires', 'stunt', 'man', 'did', 'not', 'take', 'much', 'notice.Not', 'so', 'sure', 'want', 'season', '3', 'now', 'mostly', 'stories', 'going', 'downhill', 'prices', 'season', '3', 'are', 'nearly', '3', 'times', 'more', ""'ll"", 'have', 'read', 'up', 'more', 'reviews', 'think', ""'ll"", 'likely', 'buy', 'like', 'show', 'want', 'see', 'more']",The Greatest American Hero - Season One

873836,AV5H2I9CHN8YI,B0006SSP9O,N. Gregg,"[0, 0]","I remember this show fondly from when I was growing up and it was great to watch this season again. It's a good clean show with characters you'll like and good banter. I also really enjoy the music in this series.It IS a low budget show however... as you watch episodes you will begin to notice clips they seem to reuse (mostly Ralph flying, but others too) - and the aliens are poorly done.  BUT this is a show you watch because you like the characters and the writing - not the special effects.(Other shows written and produced by Stephen J. Cannell you might be familiar with are: The Rockford Files, The Commish, and the A-Team. Chances are if you like those you will probably like this too.)In the beginning of season 1, Ralph has a young son who is enjoyable but I guess they decided the show worked better without him (how could a single father be constantly off chasing bad guys with a young boy to look after) so he slips quietly away by end of season 1. Season 2 has a LOT more episodes, and he's gained a few powers. Season 3 starts off with Ralph and Bill getting beamed up to the alien ship (and he gets another book of instructions) - and ends with them getting beamed up again and chewed out for not using the suit properly. So you see the aliens twice in season 3.What sucked was that it didn't include the 2-hr pilot episode!  If you buy the DVD it's included on there, but with Amazon instant video you're out of luck.(Blockbuster rentals shows the pilot episode is included with season 1 from them - but if you don't want to wait for that, somebody posted the pilot episode on YouTube (in 11 parts).  It's REALLY poor picture and sound quality thoughout so I don't recommend it. But I suffered thru it and will fill you in below if you want, so you can get started with Season 1, Episode 1 up-to-speed on what you missed in the pilot.*********************PILOT episode recap:*********************Begins with a black guy in a suit, getting chased in the desert by a gang of white skin heads, and they kill him.Skips to ""Ralph Hinkley"" (our hero) a HS teacher on his first day at the school, meeting his ""special ed"" students (the delinquents). For some reason he decides to take the small class on a field trip to the desert in a school mini-van bus. They stop at a cafe and the head class delinquent (Tony) has a bit of a run-in with the FBI agent ""Bill Maxwell"" but Ralph separates them and apologizes. Bill is in a bad mood and is cranky but lets it go.Later Ralph and the kids are headed back from their field trip and are driving through the desert area (in the dark), and the van dies. Ralph tells the kids to stay with the vehicle and starts walking back for help.While walking back, a car is coming at him driving wildly. Ralph throws himself down trying to avoid getting hit and the car stops right in front of him - he picks himself up and goes to check and yell at the driver who it turns out is Agent Maxwell and he seems drunk/disoriented. (He is freaked as his car just went wonky on him and can't figure it out.)Suddenly as the 2 are out there (alone), an Alien spaceship comes down - they jump into Bill's car in hopes of some protection and the door locks lock themselves and the windows won't open and they can't break out. Then the radio dial moves and selects words to tell them ""there is nothing to fear but fear itself"" and basically that they won't be harmed.  Then they hear the voice of Bill's missing FBI partner (which turns out to be the black guy that just got killed at the beginning of the show) who is talking to them from the spaceship. He says they are being offered a gift, a special suit that will work ONLY for Ralph and that they are to team up and work together to do great things for their world.  If they accept. If they don't decide to accept - the suit will self destruct within 2 weeks.They say ok and the partner beams down and comes and puts the package in the trunk. He stops for a moment and tells Bill he was shot/killed in the desert and the aliens came along a few hours later and picked him up and gave him the chance for a new life with them. He never answers Bill's questions as to what happened or who killed him. He beams back up and the ship goes away.The men freak out and go look in the trunk. Bill is refusing to believe what just happened and wants nothing to do with it. He gives the pkg to Ralph and then drives off. Ralph finds an instruction manual with the box/pkg but manages to drop it in the desert walking back to the van and students. The vehicle now magically works and they all go home.The next morning Ralph has realized he lost the manual before he got to the van last night, but decides to try on the suit (in private) while his boy is in the next room watching Superman cartoons. When he leaves for work he takes the suit.When he gets there he is told there is a drunk man in the boys room asking for him (Bill). Bill hasn't had a drink in 10 years but evidently tied one one bigtime after their alien experience. They grudgingly decide to try to work together with the suit to do good things.Later, Ralph is trying to get to the court (a custody hearing for his son, with his lawyer and now girlfriend ""Pam Davidson"" (Connie Sellecca). He realizes he is not going to make it in time by car, so he decides to wear the suit and try flying there like Superman. A little boy helps him out by telling him he has to take 3 running steps and then spring like off a diving board. This works but he's horrible at it and hits the corner of a bldg as he flies by, knocking his bundle of clothes out of his hands.He continues to holler and yell in fear as he fumbles in the air flying into a sign on the side of a building and knocking himself out.  2 cops come over to him and he has no ID and is in the suit, laying in an alley and they haul him to an institution.They strap him to a table in a room. While left alone in there he hears sounds of danger and rips himself free of the super restraints and then ""sees"" a vision on the wall of Bill in danger from the skinheads...Pam had found out where Ralph was (sorry I forget how) and she comes in to get him and finds him dressed in the red hero suit examining an area of the bare wall where he saw the vision (looking insane).Ralph determines he has to go save Bill and runs out with Pam behind him and they take off in her car.  He tells her the story but she thinks he's nuts. He rescues Bill without Pam really seeing the suit in action, and then the 3 of them are pulled over to the side of the road.Ralph proves the power of the suit to Pam by lifting the front end of the car up with Bill in it and Pam passes out. etc....they get their first bad guys together...etc.And towards the end the 3 are in the desert area again and the spaceship comes back (so now Pam sees it too) and tells them they did good and the aliens are pleased and they suggest Ralph use the invisibility powers - but fly off before he can tell them he lost the manual and needs instructions.So that's how they meet, get the suit, why Ralph has to be the one to wear it, why he doesn't have instructions, why he has to work with Bill and how Pam knows about it all.I hope you enjoy this series as much as I do. :-)",4,Wonderful show!,1345852800,"08 25, 2012",2012,7228,"['remember', 'show', 'fondly', 'when', 'was', 'growing', 'up', 'was', 'great', 'watch', 'season', 'again', 'good', 'clean',

The whole series revolves around Ralph trying to figure out how to save the world while also learning how the suit works.Ralph is paired with FBI agent Bill Maxwell (Robert Culp) after the later convieniently experiences car trouble nearby the landing site. Ralph also has a girlfriend, Pam Davidson (Connie Selleca).Joey Scarbury sings the theme song which became a runaway hit during the series run. The only really annoying thing was Hinkley's temporary name switch in the aftermath of the Reagan assasination attempt (end of this season), most people had understood this show did not endorse harming any president.Notable episodes from this season are (obviously) the ""Pilot"" which explains how Ralph got his suit and basically sets up the entire series. ""The hit car"" has Ralph helping to transport a witness in a high-profile drug smuggling case which Agent Maxwell has finally cracked. I also like ""My heroes have always been cowboys"" because meeting a childhood hero ultimately helps Ralph deal with his (obvious) feelings of disillusionment after he had almost wiped out a busload of tourists with one of his many mishaps with the suit.There are only eight episodes in this season (including the two hour pilot) but the DVD has extras.

873845,A2GP52Z7CFJ7B5,B0006SSP9O,Scott C. Smith,"[15, 15]","I was 10 when ""Superman"" was released in 1978, and like many kids that age, was very impressed with ""Superman.""Fast-forward to 1981.  ABC ran commercials for ""The Greatest American Hero"" and I was hooked even before the pilot aired in March 1981.  I watched every episode during the show's brief run, and I missed out on seeing the show in syndication due to my having joined the Navy in 1986.Television nostalgia formed the bulk of programming on the cable channel ""Nick At Night"" in the 1990s, and ""The Sci-Fi Channel"" also aired shows like ""The Six Million Dollar Man.""  I kept waiting for one of those channels to air ""The Greatest American Hero.""Imagine my surprise as I walked through my local video store and saw the DVD cover with Ralph (William Katt), Pam (Connie Selleca) and Bill (Robert Culp) on it.  My favorite show as a kid was on DVD? I could hardly believe it.  I took my purchase home and became a kid again as I watched the show.The season one DVD contains all the episodes of that season, including the pilot from 1981 and, worth the price of the DVD alone, the unaired pilot of ""The Greatest American Heroine"" from 1986, which reunited the cast.  In this pilot, Ralph is finally revealed to the world as a superhero, and all of the attention inflates Ralph's ego.  The aliens who gave Ralph the suit returned and demanded Ralph find a replacement.  The show was to air on NBC, but never did.So, how does the show hold up after 25 years?  Pretty well, actually, aside from plots involving Russians and the cold war.  For a low-budget show, the special effects were effective, and Ralph's flying scenes hold up well.  Not as well as the flying scenes from 1978's ""Superman,"" but still fun to watch.The premise: Ralph Hinkley, a liberal high-school teacher, finds himself lost in the California desert.  Also lost is conservative FBI agent Bill Maxwell.  While in the desert an alien spacecraft arrives, informing Ralph that he would be granted a suit to give him incredible powers to help mankind -- and would have to work with Maxwell.  The suit would only work on Ralph.  After receiving the suit, Ralph loses the instruction book.  Much of the humor of the show involved Ralph trying to figure out how to be a superhero.  Katt's Hinkley is an instantly likeable character, suddenly thrust into the role of unlikely hero; Culp's Maxwell is your typical 1980s G-man, played straight by Culp, although he adds a touch of humanity to Maxwell's tough-guy image.  The pair are joined by Ralph's girlfriend Pam (Connie Seleca), an attorney who, like Ralph, has a hard time coming to grips with the whole superhero idea.The trio have great chemistry, which makes for an engaging series.  And it's great fun to discover, with Ralph, what powers he has with the super-suit.  He can fly, but unlike Superman, Ralph has a tendency to crash into buildings, people, or the ground (Ralph doesn't quite get the hang of flying).  As the series progressed, Ralph started to figure out what powers he had.Included in this DVD set is 75 minutes of current interviews with the cast, another great bonus feature.Soon, season two will be released, and will offer up more nostalgia for those of us in our late 30s who tuned in to every single episode of ""The Greatest American Hero.""",5,An Underrated Classic,1109980800,"03 5, 2005",2005,3281,"['was', '10', 'when', 'Superman', 'was', 'released', '1978', 'many', 'kids', 'age', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'Superman', 'Fast-forward', '1981', 'ABC', 'ran', 'commercials', 'Greatest', 'American', 'Hero', 'was', 'hooked', 'even', 'pilot', 'aired', 'March', '1981', 'watched', 'episode', 'show', 'brief', 'run', 'missed', 'out', 'seeing', 'show', 'syndication', 'due', 'having', 'joined', 'Navy', '1986.Television', 'nostalgia', 'formed', 'bulk', 'programming', 'cable', 'channel', 'Nick', 'Night', '1990s', 'Sci-Fi', 'Channel', 'also', 'aired', 'shows', 'Six', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Man', 'kept', 'waiting', 'one', 'channels', 'air', 'Greatest', 'American', 'Hero', 'Imagine', 'surprise', 'walked', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'saw', 'DVD', 'cover', 'Ralph', 'William', 'Katt', 'Pam', 'Connie', 'Selleca', 'Bill', 'Robert', 'Culp', 'favorite', 'show', 'kid', 'was', 'DVD', 'could', 'hardly', 'believe', 'took', 'purchase', 'home', 'became', 'kid', 'again', 'watched', 'show.The', 'season', 'one', 'DVD', 'episodes', 'season', 'including', 'pilot', '1981', 'price', 'DVD', 'alone', 'unaired', 'pilot', 'Greatest', 'American', 'Heroine', '1986', 'reunited', 'cast', 'pilot', 'Ralph', 'finally', 'revealed', 'world', 'superhero', 'attention', 'Ralph', 'ego', 'aliens', 'who', 'gave', 'Ralph', 'suit', 'returned', 'demanded', 'Ralph', 'find', 'replacement', 'show', 'was', 'air', 'NBC', 'never', 'did.So', 'how', 'show', 'hold', 'up', '25', 'years', 'Pretty', 'well', 'actually', 'plots', 'involving', 'Russians', 'cold', 'war', 'low-budget', 'show', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'effective', 'Ralph', 'flying', 'scenes', 'hold', 'up', 'well', 'Not', 'as', 'well', 'flying', 'scenes', '1978', 'Superman', 'still', 'watch.The', 'premise', 'Ralph', 'Hinkley', 'liberal', 'high-school', 'teacher', 'lost', 'California', 'desert', 'Also', 'lost', 'conservative', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Bill', 'Maxwell', 'desert', 'alien', 'spacecraft', 'informing', 'Ralph', 'would', 'be', 'granted', 'suit', 'give', 'incredible', 'powers', 'help', 'mankind', 'would', 'have', 'work', 'Maxwell', 'suit', 'would', 'only', 'work', 'Ralph', 'receiving', 'suit', 'Ralph', 'instruction', 'book', 'Much', 'humor', 'show', 'involved', 'Ralph', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'be', 'superhero', 'Katt', 'Hinkley', 'instantly', 'likeable', 'character', 'suddenly', 'role', 'unlikely', 'hero', 'Culp', 'Maxwell', 'typical', '1980s', 'G-man', 'played', 'straight', 'Culp', 'touch', 'humanity', 'Maxwell', 'tough-guy', 'image', 'pair', 'are', 'joined', 'Ralph', 'girlfriend', 'Pam', 'Connie', 'Seleca', 'attorney', 'who', 'Ralph', 'hard', 'time', 'coming', 'grips', 'whole', 'superhero', 'idea.The', 'trio', 'have', 'great', 'chemistry', 'engaging', 'series', 'great', 'fun', 'discover', 'Ralph', 'what', 'super-suit', 'can', 'fly', 'Superman', 'Ralph', 'tendency', 'crash', 'buildings', 'people', 'ground', 'Ralph', ""n't"", 'quite', 'get', 'hang', 'flying', 'series', 'progressed', 'Ralph', 'started', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'had.Included', 'DVD', 'set', '75', 'minutes', 'current', 'interviews', 'cast', 'great', 'bonus', 'feature.Soon', 'season', 'two', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'will', 'offer', 'up', 'more', 'nostalgia', 'late', '30s', 'who', 'tuned', 'single', 'episode', 'Greatest', 'American', 'Hero']",The Greatest American Hero - Season One
873846,A3FDO58UAHVQD1,B0006SSP9O,Servo,"[3, 3]","Back in 1981, The Greatest American Hero was THE show to watch on ABC. William Katt's Ralph Hinkley (having lost the super suit's instruction manual) questioned ""the little green guys"" faith in him [and in the suit's design] and would hilariously fumble to save the day. Katt's chemistry with co-stars Robert Culp as scene-stealing patriot FBI agent Bill Maxwell and gorgeous Connie Sellecca as Ralph's attorney girlfriend (later wife) Pam Davidson were definitely among the show's strengths. As were those nifty 80s special effects! The super strength, the flying, the super sight and Ralph and Bill's close encounter with the little green guys still look impressive, for 80s effects. And it's still fun watching Ralph run at super speed to the sound of a speeding locomotive.While such memorable cover songs such as ""Rocket Man"" did not make it onto the DVD set, the once No.1 hit opening theme song ""Believe It, Or Not"" written by Mike Post & Stephen Geyer and performed by series vocalist Joey Scarbury is included before each episode and in the main menu. In addition to the Scarbury-performed songs that are included in the set, you still get the show's original incidental ""Believe It, Or Not"" style action music and cues by veterans Mike Post & Pete Carpenter that set the show's tone.Despite the omission of a few songs, Anchor Bay did a great restoration job with the set while Cannell and his three principles and one supporting cast member provide highly entertaining and informative interviews. Nice touch with ""Instructions"" booklet, too.Disc 1:PilotThe Hit CarHere's Looking At You, KidDisc 2:Saturday Night On Sunset BoulevardReseda RoseMy Heroes Have Always Been CowboysDisc 3:Fire ManThe Best Desk ScenarioThe Greatest American HeroineBonus Features:Brand-New Interviews (75 Minutes) with:Stephen J.

873849,A26A8T38C2GQD7,B0006SSP9O,Taheen Lopez,"[1, 1]","This comedy drama series that aired from the Spring of 1981 thru the Winter of 1983 on ABC created by Stephen J. Cannell that debuted with a 2-hour movie pilot on Wednesday March 18, 1981 starred Bill Katt as high school teacher of Special Education students(Ralph Hinkley), Bob Culp as FBI Agent(Bill Maxwell), and Connie Sellecca as Ralph's lawyer and new wife(Pam Davidson)about chronicaling Ralph's adventures after a group of aliens give him a red suit that gives him superhuman abilities.Unfortunately, Ralph hates wearing the suit & immediately loses its instruction booklet & thus has to learn how to use his powers by trial & error, often with comical results.This 1981-82 Season of THE GREATEST AMERICAN HERO takes me all the way back to memory lane when THE GREATEST AMERICAN HERO theme song ""Believe It Or Not"" by Joey Scarbury became a big hit on the radio back in the early 1980's and when THE GREATEST AMERICAN HERO was part of ABC's Wednesday night line-up starting with THE GREATEST AMERICAN HERO at 8PM followed by THE FALL GUY at 9PM, and then topped off by DYNASTY at 10PM, which reminds me that ABC's motto at the time was ""Now Is The Time, ABC Is The Place"".Therefore, THE GREATEST AMERICAN HERO and THE FALL GUY used to give me something to look forward to every hump day along with the fact that THE GREATEST AMERICAN HERO's 2nd Season was an upgrade from it's 1st Season, since THE GREATEST AMERICAN HERO's First Season was when this show was just starting to crawl, but THE GREATEST AMERICAN HERO's Second Season was pretty much when this show started to walk, especially since this show was still in its honeymoon phase during this season.Additionally, I would have to say that this was the strongest season of them all throughout THE GREATEST AMERICAN HERO's whole 2-year run on ABC, since the ratings on this show went downhill in the Third Season when ABC had moved THE GREATEST AMERICAN HERO to Friday nights in the Fall of 1982 and due to a change in management at ABC since the new managers requested for more-heroic save-by-the-day episodes instead of being more of a down-to-Earth, real-life problems like show, which resulted in ABC cancelling this show on Thursday February 3, 1983.In addition to what led to a sharp drop in ratings, THE GREATEST AMERICAN HERO had started losing a lot of viewers through more popular TV shows like KNIGHT RIDER & THE DUKES OF HAZZARD, which conflicted with THE GREATEST AMERICAN HERO's time slot on ABC's Friday night line-up, since THE DUKES OF HAZZARD was shown on CBS at the same time slot that THE GREATEST AMERICAN HERO was shown on ABC every Friday night and then KNIGHT RIDER came out that same year on NBC being shown every Friday at 9PM on top of that wiping out just about every show in the ratings department that season, which therefore pretty much resulted in KNIGHT RIDER K.O.ing THE GREATEST AMERICAN HERO and THE DUKES OF HAZZARD among many other shows.This season also takes me all the way back to memory lane when we had all those budget cuts going on from the recession we were in back in 1981-1982 during Ronald Reagan's presidency.",4,Believe It Or Not!,1228003200,"11 30, 2008",2008,3123,"['comedy', 'drama', 'series', 'aired', 'Spring', '1981', 'Winter', '1983', 'ABC', 'created', 'Stephen', 'J.',

Oh Yeah!  THAT show!  Greatest American Hero was never a big hit and lasted only three seasons and 44 episodes.  But it's one of those shows that seems ingrained into our memories..the part of the memory that stores schlockey, cheesy fun.  Part of it certainly has to do with the very catchy theme song that was a hit in its own right and gained new fame when George Costanza used it as music for his answering machine on an episode of Seinfeld.William Katt Stars as Ralph Hinkley (later renamed Hanley after the assasination attempt on President Reagan), a rather sheepish high school teacher who gets stuck with a class full of dilinquents led by Tony (Michael Pare).  Taking his students on a field trip out to the desert, thier bus mysteriously dies.  As Ralph walks back to a gas station he encounters FBI Agent Bill Maxwell (Robert Culp) and a UFO.  The pair are informed by Bill's dead partner about a suit that grants its wearer great powers of strength, flight, invisibility, and more...Ralph reluctantly wears the Suit and joins with Maxwell to use the powers to fight evil.  Only problem is that Ralph lost the instructions for the suit so learning the powers becomes trial and error.Season one had just 9 episodes including the pilot where Ralph got the suit.""The Hit Car"" - Ralph and Bill must escort a mobsters girlfriend to court so she can testify against him.  Ralph has to fight off several attempts to stop them and then they find it was all a set-up.""Here's looking at you kid"" - Pam's parents come for a visit, but before Ralph can even meet them Bill shows up to get his help to stop a group of rogue arms dealers. Ralph discovers the suits power of invisibility but has trouble controlling it.""Saturday on Sunset Boulevard""  Bill enlists Raplh's aid, along with Ralph's students to track down a Soviet defector.  Also the students begin calling Ralph ""Mr. H"" as the Hinkley would be dropped or dubbed over.""Reseda Rose"" - Ralph and Bill try to unravel a case involving secret military plans, a Russian submarine, and the kidnapping of Rhonda's mother.  Ralph's name ""officially"" is changed to Hanley.""My Heroes have Always Been Cowboys"" - Ralph nearly kills a busload of people while chasing some crooks.  Ralph decides to put away the suit for good but then changes his mind after speaking to his own boyhood hero John Hart who played the Lone Ranger.  Great Episode!""Fire Man"" - Tony is hired to repossess cars, and unknowingly takes a car filled with arson equipment. He gets pulled over, and blamed for setting fires. The real arsonist must be found in order to clear his name, and free him from jail.""The Best Desk Scenario"" When Bill is passed over for a promotion, he decides to quit the FBI.  But Ralph needs his help to rescue Pam who has been kidnapped by the mob.In addition to the 9 episodes the DVD set includes a pilot for the spinoff series Greatest American heroine shot a few years later where Ralph has to give up the suit and find someone to take his place.This was the kind of fun, 80's show, much like the A-Team where there was a lot of action but no one ever really got killed or hurt.  A simpler show for simpler times.  Katt was perfectly cast as the nebbish, reluctant superhero and Culp was sardonicly well-fit for the role as the tough FBI agent.

873853,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B0006SSP9O,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[1, 1]","THE GREATEST AMERICAN HERO was one of those shows I remember watching fondly as a kid. I looked forward to watching the adventures of Ralph Hinkly and Bill Maxwell each week and seeing what trouble they would get into.  THE GREATEST AMERICAN HERO came out during a time when it wasn't common to have superheroes how came from normal backgrounds.  The SUPERMAN movies had only been out a few years and Hollywood was sucking up superhero scripts left and right (though most of them were never made).  What was unique about THE GREATEST AMERICAN HERO was that Ralph Hinkley was just an ordinary guy who was given a suit with superpowers (kind of like the Green Lantern).  Ralph didn't grow up rich or come from outer space, he was just a high school teacher trying to make a difference in the world.Ralph was partnered with Bill Maxwell, a CIA agent with a patriotic fervor and a nose for knowing where the bad guys were.  Bill was a perfect foil for Ralph and together they made a great duo.  Add the lovely Pam Davidson into the mix as Ralph's fiance and the useful 3rd-string utility person and you have a perfect blend.William Katt played Ralph, Robert Culp played Maxwell, and Connie Sellecca played Pam.  The chemistry between the three was wonderful and helped cement the show in reality.Ralph becomes the Greatest American Hero because one night while taking his students in a field trip out in the desert, their bus dies down. Ralph hitch hikes to get some help and is picked up by Maxwell.  While together, the car stops and starts doing some goofy things.  Then a spaceship appears and delivers a magic suit to the duo. Ralph is the one to whom the suit is given, but Maxwell is to be his partner. However, while walking back to the bus, Ralph looses the instructions to the suit. Therefore, when the adventures start he has no idea of what the suit is capable of.  He's taught how to fly by a little kid, but as much flying as he does, Ralph never does quite catch on how to fly properly.Hollogram imagine, invisibility, superstrength, and invisibility are all attributes that the suit gives to Ralph when he wears it.But, he doesn't learn about these things easily.This Season One set of THE GREATEST AMERICAN HERO includes all 8 episodes of the first season.  The show debuted after the Super Bowl in 1981 and was an overnight phenomena and a huge success. My favorite episodes of the first season are:Episode 1 ""The Greatest American Hero""--the series pilot.Episode 6 ""My Heroes Have Always Been Cowboys""--the Lone Rangermakes an appearance and gives encouragement to a new hero.Episode 8 ""The Best Desk Scenario""--Pam is kidnapped and Ralphand Bill have to rescue her.  This episode captures theessence of what made the series unique, little things were atthe heart of the show while the superhero stuff was mostlybackdrop and filler.If you watched carefully, Danny Glover has a brief role in Episode 7 ""Fire Man"".  Extras with this set include a set of interviews with Stephen Cannell, William Katt, Robert Culp, Connie Sellecca, and Michael Pare; as well as the pilot for a never planned-out sequel THE GREATEST AMERICAN HEROINE.",5,Believe It Or Not.,1140393600,"02 20, 2006",2006,3144,"['GREATEST', 'AMERICAN', 'HERO', 'was', 'one', 'shows', 'remember', 'watching', 'fondly', 'kid', 'looked', 'forward', 'watching', 'adventures', 'Ralph', 'Hinkly', 'Bill', 'Maxwell', 'week', 'seeing', 'what', 'trouble', 'would', 'get', 'GREATEST', 'AMERICAN', 'HERO', 'came', 'out', 'time', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'common', 'have', 'superheroes', 'how', 'came', 'normal', 'backgrounds', 'SUPERMAN', 'movies', 'had', 'only', 'been', 'out', 'few', 'years', 'Hollywood', 'was', 'sucking', 'up', 'superhero', 'scripts', 'left', 'right', 'most', 'were', 'never', 'made', 'What', 'was', 'unique', 'GREATEST', 'AMERICAN', 'HERO', 'was', 'Ralph', 'Hinkley', 'was', 'just', 'ordinary', 'guy', 'who', 'was', 'given', 'suit', 'superpowers', 'kind', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'Ralph', 'did', ""n't"", 'grow', 'up', 'rich', 'come', 'outer', 'space', 'was', 'just', 'high', 'school', 'teacher', 'trying', 'make', 'difference', 'world.Ralph', 'was', 'partnered', 'Bill', 'Maxwell', 'CIA', 'agent', 'patriotic', 'fervor', 'nose', 'knowing', 'where', 'bad', 'guys', 'were', 'Bill', 'was', 'perfect', 'foil', 'Ralph', 'together', 'made', 'great', 'duo', 'Add', 'lovely', 'Pam', 'Davidson', 'mix', 'Ralph', 'fiance', 'useful', '3rd-string', 'utility', 'person', 'have', 'perfect', 'blend.William', 'Katt', 'played', 'Ralph', 'Robert', 'Culp', 'played', 'Maxwell', 'Connie', 'Sellecca', 'played', 'Pam', 'chemistry', 'three', 'was', 'wonderful', 'helped', 'cement', 'show', 'reality.Ralph', 'Greatest', 'American', 'Hero', 'one', 'night', 'taking', 'students', 'field', 'trip', 'desert', 'bus', 'down', 'Ralph', 'hitch', 'hikes', 'get', 'help', 'picked', 'up', 'Maxwell', 'together', 'car', 'stops', 'doing', 'goofy', 'things', 'Then', 'spaceship', 'magic', 'suit', 'duo', 'Ralph', 'one', 'whom', 'suit', 'given', 'Maxwell', 'be', 'partner', 'However', 'walking', 'back', 'bus', 'Ralph', 'instructions', 'suit', 'Therefore', 'when', 'adventures', 'start', 'idea', 'what', 'suit', 'capable', 'taught', 'how', 'fly', 'little', 'kid', 'as', 'much', 'flying', 'Ralph', 'never', 'quite', 'catch', 'how', 'fly', 'properly.Hollogram', 'imagine', 'invisibility', 'superstrength', 'invisibility', 'are', 'attributes', 'suit', 'Ralph', 'when', 'it.But', ""n't"", 'learn', 'things', 'easily.This', 'Season', 'One', 'set', 'THE', 'GREATEST', 'AMERICAN', 'HERO', '8', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'show', 'debuted', 'Super', 'Bowl', '1981', 'was', 'overnight', 'phenomena', 'huge', 'success', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'are', 'Episode', '1', 'Greatest', 'American', 'Hero', 'series', 'pilot.Episode', '6', 'Heroes', 'Have', 'Always', 'Been', 'Cowboys', 'Lone', 'Rangermakes', 'appearance', 'encouragement', 'new', 'hero.Episode', '8', 'Best', 'Desk', 'Scenario', 'Pam', 'kidnapped', 'Ralphand', 'Bill', 'have', 'rescue', 'episode', 'theessence', 'what', 'made', 'series', 'unique', 'little', 'things', 'were', 'atthe', 'heart', 'show', 'superhero', 'stuff', 'was', 'mostlybackdrop', 'filler.If', 'watched', 'carefully', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'brief', 'role', 'Episode', '7', 'Fire', 'Man', 'Extras', 'set', 'include', 'set', 'interviews', 'Stephen', 'Cannell', 'William', 'Katt', 'Robert', 'Culp', 'Connie', 'Sellecca', 'Michael', 'Pare', 'as', 'well', 'pilot', 'never', 'planned-out', 'sequel', 'THE', 'GREATEST', 'AMERICAN', 'HEROINE']",The Greatest American Hero - Season One

873855,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B0006SSP9O,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[95, 99]","Although it's now fashionable to watch a superhero struggle with his or her abilities in movies and TV, it wasn't always the case. William Katt played Ralph Hinkley an ordinary guy who is left a gift from aliens from outer space-a suit that gives its wearer the ability to fly, super strength, invisibility and much more. Suddenly, he had all these super powers but lost the owner's manual to tell him how to use it correctly. Ralph ends up flying into walls and generally having as many mishaps as a superhero could possibly have. Befriended by FBI agent Bill Maxwell (Robert Culp) Hinkley partners with him and decides to fight for good. These first eight episodes (including the two hour pilot ) made up the first season of the series. The two hour pilot soars with nice comedic touches by Katt, Connie Selleca and the perfect straight man in Culp. In fact, Culp plays it so seriously that it comes off almost as a parody of a government agent.With an exceptionally good transfer, ""The Greatest American Hero"" looks almost as if it was invulnerable to the ravages of time. The transfers look very nice with solid blacks and color reproduction. Considering the show is twenty five years old, there are few of the flaws that one might expect. The image is occasionally soft but and has some minor analog imperfections (such as dust, dirt particularly during the effects shots) on the whole, Anchor Bay has done a meticulous job in transferring this series to DVD. The sound while limited by the technology of the time (it was broadcast in mono) has good presence with the dialogue very clear. Some minor background hiss crops up from time to time. Although the box says this is in stereo it sounds like mono to me.We get a pilot for a spin off entitled ""The Greatest American Heroine"". While only one episode was shot, what we have is quite good and promising. Sadly, no network picked up the spin-off so, until recently, it has sat on the shelf. In the spin off Hinkley hands off the suit to a young woman and she takes up where he left off. We also get interviews with stars William Katt, Robert Culp, Connie Selleca and writer/producer/creator Stephen J. Cannell. Culp provides some interesting tidbits in his interview. For example, the reason Bill Maxwell comes across so intense and humorless is because Culp decided to play the role that way. He figured that there with others playing for laughs, presenting his character as serious would provide an anchor to reality and prevent the show from becoming too tongue-in-cheek. With over an hour of interviews, this portion of the set is extremely generous. No commentary tracks from anyone but, really, the interviews do make up for that. Hopefully in future sets we can have commentary tracks on key episodes by the actors and Cannell.",4,The world's least likely superhero,1108425600,"02 15, 2005",2005,2791,"['now', 'fashionable', 'watch', 'superhero', 'struggle', 'abilities', 'movies', 'TV', 'was', ""n't"", 'always', 'case', 'William', 'Katt', 'played', 'Ralph', 'Hinkley', 'ordinary', 'guy', 'who', 'left', 'gift', 'aliens', 'outer', 'space-a', 'suit', 'wearer', 'ability', 'fly', 'super', 'strength', 'invisibility', 'much', 'more', 'Suddenly', 'had', 'super', 'powers', 'lost', 'owner', 'manual', 'tell', 'how', 'use', 'correctly', 'Ralph', 'up', 'flying', 'walls', 'generally', 'having', 'many', 'mishaps', 'superhero', 'could', 'possibly', 'have', 'Befriended', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Bill', 'Maxwell', 'Robert', 'Culp', 'Hinkley', 'partners', 'decides', 'fight', 'good', 'first', 'eight', 'episodes', 'including', 'two', 'hour', 'pilot', 'made', 'up', 'first', 'season', 'series', 'two', 'hour', 'pilot', 'soars', 'nice', 'comedic', 'touches', 'Katt', 'Connie', 'Selleca', 'perfect', 'straight', 'man', 'Culp', 'fact', 'Culp', 'so', 'seriously', 'off', 'almost', 'parody', 'government', 'exceptionally', 'good', 'transfer', 'Greatest', 'American', 'Hero', 'almost', 'was', 'invulnerable', 'ravages', 'time', 'transfers', 'look', 'very', 'nice', 'solid', 'blacks', 'color', 'reproduction', 'Considering', 'show', 'twenty', 'five', 'years', 'old', 'are', 'few', 'flaws', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'image', 'occasionally', 'soft', 'minor', 'analog', 'imperfections', 'such', 'dust', 'dirt', 'particularly', 'effects', 'shots', 'whole', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'done', 'meticulous', 'job', 'transferring', 'series', 'DVD', 'sound', 'limited', 'technology', 'time', 'was', 'broadcast', 'mono', 'good', 'presence', 'dialogue', 'very', 'clear', 'minor', 'background', 'hiss', 'crops', 'time', 'time', 'box', 'stereo', 'mono', 'me.We', 'get', 'pilot', 'spin', 'off', 'entitled', 'Greatest', 'American', 'Heroine', 'only', 'one', 'episode', 'was', 'shot', 'what', 'have', 'quite', 'good', 'promising', 'Sadly', 'network', 'picked', 'up', 'spin-off', 'so', 'recently', 'sat', 'shelf', 'spin', 'off', 'Hinkley', 'hands', 'suit', 'young', 'woman', 'up', 'where', 'left', 'off', 'also', 'get', 'interviews', 'stars', 'William', 'Katt', 'Robert', 'Culp', 'Connie', 'Selleca', 'writer/producer/creator', 'Stephen', 'J.', 'Cannell', 'Culp', 'interesting', 'tidbits', 'interview', 'example', 'reason', 'Bill', 'Maxwell', 'intense', 'humorless', 'Culp', 'decided', 'play', 'role', 'way', 'figured', 'others', 'playing', 'laughs', 'presenting', 'character', 'serious', 'would', 'provide', 'anchor', 'reality', 'prevent', 'show', 'becoming', 'too', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'hour', 'interviews', 'portion', 'set', 'extremely', 'generous', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'anyone', 'really', 'interviews', 'do', 'make', 'up', 'Hopefully', 'future', 'sets', 'can', 'have', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'key', 'episodes', 'actors', 'Cannell']",The Greatest American Hero - Season One
