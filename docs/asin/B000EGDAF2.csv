Too bad season 2 was never released on DVD - guess it wasn't a big seller but season 1 is fantastic in every way. I love that the theme song is a classic Beatles song.

They really don't make t.v. like this anymore, and that's a shame.  The Thatchers were a believable family, albeit a very unique one.I do think the first season was a bit uneven, as the show struggled to become more than just a soapbox for accepting different people (i.e., Corky's Down Syndrome).  And they never could seem to figure out what to do with oldest daughter Paige (who was played by another actress in seasons 2-4).  But it's still engaging family drama that never gets TOO preachy.The best part about the first season has to be Kellie Martin as Becca.  The part was smarter and better-written than any teenage role I can recall.  Martin just got better as the series went on; it's a shame she would only do one more series (the short-lived CHRISTY) before becoming the queen of t.v. movies throughout much of the 90's.I hope that this set sells well so Warner will be able to release the remaining seasons of Life Goes On.",4,Sunday dinner with the Thatchers,1139356800,"02 8, 2006",2006,1028,"[""'ve"", 'got', 'great', 'memories', 'watching', 'show', 'Sundays', 'night', 'dinner', 'family', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 't.v', 'anymore', 'shame', 'Thatchers', 'were', 'believable', 'family', 'very', 'unique', 'one.I', 'do', 'think', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'bit', 'uneven', 'show', 'struggled', 'become', 'more', 'just', 'soapbox', 'accepting', 'different', 'people', 'i.e.', 'Corky', 'Down', 'Syndrome', 'never', 'could', 'seem', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'do', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'Paige', 'who', 'was', 'played', 'actress', 'seasons', '2-4', 'still', 'engaging', 'family', 'drama', 'never', 'TOO', 'preachy.The', 'best', 'part', 'first', 'season', 'be', 'Kellie', 'Martin', 'Becca', 'part', 'was', 'smarter', 'better-written', 'teenage', 'role', 'can', 'recall', 'Martin', 'just', 'got', 'better', 'series', 'went', 'shame', 'would', 'only', 'do', 'one', 'more', 'series', 'short-lived', 'CHRISTY', 'becoming', 'queen', 't.v', 'movies', 'much', ""90's.I"", 'hope', 'set', 'well', 'so', 'Warner', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'release', 'remaining', 'seasons', 'Life', 'Goes']",Life Goes On: Season 1

I kept thinking that with just about every other TV show released, it has to come out sometime.  It finally does in May 2006.I ""discovered"" Life Goes On late in its last season on ABC.  I watched maybe the last six episodes on Sunday night.  I did not think I would like it at first, but it turned out I loved it.  After it was cancelled, I began watching reruns on the Family Channel, but sadly it was removed from the lineup shortly after.Life Goes On tackles many issues without being political.  The characters are all very well developed and each one is allowed to be the star in certain episodes.  Sadly the show was advertised and perceived as a show ""about a boy with Down's Syndrome"".  Certainly it broke new ground with that and the character Corky was big in the show, but as the first season progressed, Kellie Martin's character Becca became the star.  Becca was a great character and Martin played her very well.  It is a worthwhile family drama that will be a good investment.

He's taught so many of us to look differently at people with handicaps; to not see them as people to pity, but to see them as individuals conquering life just like the rest of us. Corky was different, that's true. He had a handicap, that was true too. But he was bright, intelligent, and sensitive--in his own right--and his character reached through the television screen and taught the world so much about life and about living.

972143,A14W0N8PWQAKYU,B000EGDAF2,"Ashley ""conga1985""","[9, 9]","My second favorite family drama of all time (Our House ranks #1) is finally coming to DVD!  I watched this show religiously every Sunday night (back to back with America's Funniest Home Videos) when it originally aired.  Like the other vreviewer said, the only bad part is that the original theme will not be intact.  But hey, it's a small price to pay to have the show on DVD.  I urge all fans of this show to PLEASE buy this set despite the theme change.  There is a lot more to a show than just it's theme.  This show is very deserving to have all four seasons released.  I believe Warner Bros. also owns ""Our House,"" so hopefully if this does well they'll eventually feel comfortable with releasing ""Our House"" as well.  First Knots Landing, now Life Goes On.  Well done, Warner!UPDATE;  Sitcoms Online has posted a review of the set and even has an audio clip of the new theme song.  However, the original theme song is still in tact in the pilot! :)  The original closing song is in tact in the pilot as well, and the original end theme is in tact in all the other episodes.  The new theme song is alright, but the DVD reviewer was right when they said it sounds more like it's for a teen show but still catchy. The only problem I have with the new theme song is that it sounds a little too today-ish.  But it's the episodes themselves that really count and that's all that matters.If you'd like to read the review and listen to the audio files, just go to Sitcoms Online (with your standard [...] and .com after it).

972147,A2BEU7GPGNIG44,B000EGDAF2,Dorrie Wheeler,"[4, 5]","Life Goes On is a television series that premiered in 1989. The show was about a working class family whose oldest son had Down's Syndrome. Life Goes On was really a groundbreaking show and sadly their hasn't been a similar network show since.The show was centered around the character Corky for the most part. The role was portrayed by actor Chris Burke who really was living with Down's Syndrome. At the beginning of the series 18 year old Corky is entering a regular high school via mainstreaming after years of private school. Corky is very smart, but he has Down's which often makes him the butt of jokes and teasing. On the first day of school he is befriended by a popular jock who looks out for him. Turns out this characters brother has Down's Syndrome so he can related to the plight of Corky and his family. Corky attends school with his sister Becca (who has a crush on Tyler the jock).The Thatcher family is very endearing and they are a very real family. They aren't rich and they have their ups and down's. It's really heart breaking to see the things that Corky has to encounter during his first year of high school but it's a very real and honest show about a kid living with a disability. Fans of this show will surely be interested in this set.

I still remember trying to finish up last-minute stuff, have my shower and get ready for school the next day in time to watch ""Life Goes On"" (and on many occasions, ""America's Funniest Home Videos"" after that)Often I would be running late, and would watch ""Life Goes On"" in my parents bedroom, practically still dripping wet, wearing a bathrobe, with my hair wrapped up turban-style in a towel to air-dry as my dad ironed his work clothes, and I watched the show.I have LOVED ""Life Goes On"" for its entire run! It is a poignant and touching family drama, starring Bill Smitrovich and Patti LuPone as ""Drew"" (Smitrovich) and ""Libby"" (LuPone) Thatcher, a middle working-class couple, who are dealing with the issue of ""mainstreaming"" their 18 year old son, Charles ""Corky"" who has Downs Syndrome into a regular, public high school as a freshman, and all the challenges and trials, tribulations, and triumphs that go along with it.Drew and Libby have their hands full, raising Corky and their 2 other children, twenty-something Paige (Monique Lanier in Season 1, Tracey Needham in Season 2-4) who is Drew's child from a previous marriage, and 14 or 15 year old Rebecca ""Becca"" while trying to make ends meet on Drew's construction worker salary, and Libby's income as a secretary/clerical worker in an advertising agency.Towards the end of the first season, Drew buys a diner, and quits his back-breaking construction work to run the restaurant, and things start looking up for the Thatchers.Growing up I LOVED watching ""Life Goes On"", especially because of Kellie Martin, and Monique Lanier. Though I liked Tracey Needham, I was IMMENSELY disappointed when Monique left, and the role of Paige was recast with Tracey. Because up until then, I LOVED Paige best, and then Becca. After Monique left and Tracey assumed the role, it changed and I LOVED Becca best.This is a BEAUTIFUL series, and one of the many nostalgic highlights of my childhood and adolescence.When I think of my childhood and preteen years, I think of shows like ""Punky Brewster"", ""Life Goes On"", ""Perfect Strangers"", ""Who's the Boss?"", ""Head of the Class"" and many more!But ""Life Goes On"" (and a few very select others), had and still does have a very special place in my heart!I CAN'T WAIT until the other 3 seasons are released!

I have probably half the episodes of LGO on video, but I have watched them each atleast 50 times and my tapes are getting worn out.This show is about a middle class family residing in Glenbrook, Il. The main character ""Corky"",played by Chris Burke, has Downs Syndrome yet manages to rise above his limitations and lead a pretty normal life. He goes to a regular high school, dates, works part time, and brings happiness to everyone. The family encounters other problems besides Corky's condition, but manages to get through due to their faith in God and love and commitment for each other.Patty Lupone, the Broadway Star, plays Corky's mom. In many episodes she sings, what a treat!I think this first season was the best. My all time favorite episode is from the first season, the one where Corky develops a crush on the new girl in school ""Ginny"" played by Shannon Doherty. I also love the episode where Becca gets her first kiss.  I know Kellie Martin mentioned once that her favorite episode is from the first season and it's the one where her beloved ballet teacher has to move into a retirement home and can no longer teach ballet.Martin also said her all time favorite role was playing Becca on LGO.I hope this season sells really well so that all four seasons will be released and available for purchase.

972159,A1OBPHRXHZF8P6,B000EGDAF2,"Robin Orlowski ""political activist""","[53, 56]","Family dramas had existed since the invention of television-but 'Life Goes On' really attempted to deal with real life.14 years after the passage of laws requiring special education, this was the first series realistically examining a person with a disability as lead character that audiences intentionally were supposed to empathize with.Nineteen year old Charles ""Corky"" Thatcher has Downs Syndrome (as does the actor Chris Burke who plays him). Many plots of this award-winning series involved Corky adjusting to being mainstreamed in a regular school after previously having attended a special school.Younger sister Becca  (Kellie Martin-in her breakout role) loves her brother, but also wrestles with her own challenges of wanting to support family while wanting to fit in with her peers who don't take easily to the `weird'. Winning the affections of Tyler Benchfield (Tommy Puett) is her recurring goal throughout the 1989-1990 season.  She also gets an EXCELLENT `star' episode in ""Becca and the Underground Newspaper"" , learning the hard way that publishing everything and anything you find out without first doing fact-checking is irresponsible journalism. Tyler is admittedly hot for the era, but the writers wanted Becca to also be daring.""Corky for President"" is a good episode because Corky runs for president---without realizing that the girl whom he sincerely had a crush on encouraged him to run to only toy with his emotions. She did not feel the same way about him. At the same time, it showed Corky seriously campaigning and sincerely believing that he could be president.Another memorable episode is ""The Baby-sitter"" because Corky gets a job as a babysitter, taking care of children. This is important because people with disabilities ourselves are historically portrayed as children, needing other people to take care of us. Corky himself is considered responsible and capable.""Ordinary Heroes"" is a pivotal episode because Drew decides to quit his construction business and instead open up a restaurant. The current owner of the property the Thatchers are interested in won't sell because of Corky's disability, but the Thatcher family restaurant ultimately comes into fruition.Then, Corky is paired up with none other than Shannen Doherty herself when a teacher has students do a `marriage' project (""Corky's Crush"").He subsequently develops a crush on her-while she has the hots for another guy. I still get a kick out of this episode because both Kellie Martin and Doherty now look so different from how they once looked.""Corky Rebels"" is an important episode because it communicates that some families smother their members with disabilities under the guise of protecting them They don't want to acknowledge us as being independent. Corky's `fight the power' act looks somewhat campy now, but ironically aired at a time when disability activists demanded greater freedoms for people with disabilities and passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act.""The Return of Uncle Richard"" reminds us that those upcoming freedoms will not leave the world in a free for all. Drew Thatcher (Bill Smitrovitch) mends fences with his estranged brother Richard so Corky still will have a guardian if something bad were to happen to his parents.I have a different disability and am a young adult in a much different era, but this series continues to address so many similar issues. It grows ever more relevant for me and other people with disabilities. Many of our experiences continue being reflected in the series scripts without being condescending, overdramatic, or disempowering.Extras include commentary by both Chris Burke and the series creator Michael Braverman. During this season only, Paige Thatcher, Drew's daughter from a previous marriage, is played by Monique Lanier.  This series was good in it's time, but grows ever more cherished with age. It's a scathing indictment of current television that other series have yet to make a similar cultural impact, particularly concerning people with disabilities, our families, and friends.",5,Spend time with the Thatchers,1146960000,"05 7, 2006",2006,4060,"['Family', 'dramas', 'had', 'existed', 'invention', 'television-but', ""'Life"", 'Goes', 'really', 'attempted', 'deal', 'real', 'life.14', 'years', 'passage', 'laws', 'requiring', 'special', 'education', 'was', 'first', 'series', 'realistically', 'examining', 'person', 'disability', 'lead', 'character', 'intentionally', 'were', 'supposed', 'empathize', 'with.Nineteen', 'year', 'old', 'Charles', 'Corky', 'Thatcher', 'Downs', 'Syndrome', 'actor', 'Chris', 'Burke', 'who', 'Many', 'plots', 'award-winning', 'series', 'involved', 'Corky', 'adjusting', 'being', 'mainstreamed', 'regular', 'school', 'previously', 'having', 'attended', 'special', 'school.Younger', 'sister', 'Becca', 'Kellie', 'Martin-in', 'breakout', 'role', 'brother', 'also', 'own', 'challenges', 'wanting', 'support', 'family', 'wanting', 'fit', 'peers', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'easily', 'weird', 'Winning', 'affections', 'Tyler', 'Benchfield', 'Tommy', 'Puett', 'recurring', 'goal', '1989-1990', 'season', 'also', 'EXCELLENT', 'star', 'episode', 'Becca', 'Underground', 'Newspaper', 'learning', 'hard', 'way', 'publishing', 'everything', 'anything', 'find', 'out', 'first', 'doing', 'fact-checking', 'irresponsible', 'journalism', 'Tyler', 'admittedly', 'hot', 'era', 'writers', 'wanted', 'Becca', 'also', 'be', 'daring', 'Corky', 'President', 'good', 'episode', 'Corky', 'president', 'realizing', 'girl', 'whom', 'sincerely', 'had', 'crush', 'encouraged', 'run', 'only', 'toy', 'emotions', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'same', 'way', 'same', 'time', 'showed', 'Corky', 'seriously', 'campaigning', 'sincerely', 'believing', 'could', 'be', 'memorable', 'episode', 'Baby-sitter', 'Corky', 'job', 'babysitter', 'taking', 'care', 'children', 'important', 'people', 'disabilities', 'ourselves', 'are', 'historically', 'portrayed', 'children', 'needing', 'other', 'people', 'take', 'care', 'Corky', 'considered', 'responsible', 'capable', 'Ordinary', 'Heroes', 'pivotal', 'episode', 'Drew', 'quit', 'construction', 'business', 'instead', 'open', 'up', 'restaurant', 'current', 'owner', 'property', 'Thatchers', 'are', 'interested', 'wo', ""n't"", 'sell', 'Corky', 'disability', 'Thatcher', 'family', 'restaurant', 'ultimately', 'fruition.Then', 'Corky', 'paired', 'up', 'none', 'other', 'Shannen', 'Doherty', 'when', 'teacher', 'students', 'do', 'marriage', 'project', 'Corky', 'Crush', '.He', 'subsequently', 'crush', 'her-while', 'hots', 'guy', 'still', 'get', 'kick', 'episode', 'Kellie', 'Martin', 'Doherty', 'now', 'look', 'so', 'different', 'how', 'once', 'looked', 'Corky', 'Rebels', 'important', 'episode', 'families', 'smother', 'members', 'disabilities', 'guise', 'protecting', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'acknowledge', 'being', 'independent', 'Corky', 'fight', 'power', 'act', 'somewhat', 'campy', 'now', 'ironically', 'aired', 'time', 'when', 'disability', 'activists', 'demanded', 'greater', 'freedoms', 'people', 'disabilities', 'passage', 'Americans', 'Disabilities', 'Act', 'Return', 'Uncle', 'Richard', 'upcoming', 'freedoms', 'will', 'not', 'leave', 'world', 'free', 'Drew', 'Thatcher', 'Bill', 'Smitrovitch', 'fences', 'estranged', 'brother', 'Richard', 'Corky', 'still', 'will', 'have', 'guardian', 'something', 'bad', 'were', 'happen', 'parents.I', 'have', 'different', 'disability', 'am', 'young', 'adult', 'much', 'different', 'era', 'series', 'address', 'so', 'many', 'similar', 'issues', 'ever', 'more', 'relevant', 'other', 'people', 'disabilities', 'Many', 'experiences', 'continue', 'being', 'reflected', 'series', 'being', 'condescending', 'overdramatic', 'disempowering.Extras', 'include', 'commentary', 'Chris', 'Burke', 'series', 'creator', 'Michael', 'Braverman', 'season', 'only', 'Paige', 'Thatcher', 'Drew', 'daughter', 'previous', 'marriage', 'played', 'Monique', 'Lanier', 'series', 'was', 'good', 'time', 'ever', 'more', 'cherished', 'age', 'scathing', 'indictment', 'current', 'television', 'other', 'series', 'have', 'yet', 'make', 'similar', 'cultural', 'impact', 'particularly', 'concerning', 'people', 'disabilities', 'families', 'friends']",Life Goes On: Season 1
972160,A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ,B000EGDAF2,Sean Pasek,"[38, 40]","Oh-blah-dee, Oh-blie-dah, Life Goes On!I grew up with many family shows such as Little House on the Praire, the Waltons, and so forth.  But, Life Goes On will always be my favorite.Life Goes On put realism and just a touch of grit into television as it attempted to broadcast to families the changing times, the new issues facing teenagers, and the plights of an American family constantly struggling to make do.Life Goes On is the first television series to have a down-syndrome actor as one of its stars.  Chris Burke (Charles ""Corky"" Thacher) is simply wonderful.  You will see over the course of four seasons how his acting range really blossoms.  He was originally going to be the focal point of the show.Life Goes On is about the Thachers...a semi-middle class family living in Glenbrook Illinois which is a suburb of Chicago.  It is the story of a hard-working family that faces one plight after another...just like life!Drew Thacher (Bill Smitrovich) is the father who is working as a construction worker.  He's tired of ""just getting by"" with the hard physical labor and the small checks.  He plays a father who loves his children and is always trying to find a way to get ahead; to get on top of things.  His life-long dream is to be the owner of a restaurant.  Over the course of the first season we find out if he can achieve this dream or not...and if so, what are the costs?Libby Thacher is wonderfully played by stage performer and Tony award winner, Patti Lupone.  She works for an advertising agency run by Jerry (who becomes a favorite character played by Ray Butenika).  Libby is tired of doing all of Jerry's dirty work...taking his clothes to the cleaners, washing his car, getting him coffee, etc.  She feels she can do more than this, but Jerry is stingy and tries to cut financial costs and corners wherever he can.Paige is Drew's daughter from his first marriage.  She is out of high school, and a bit of a leaf blowing in the wind.  She doesn't know what she wants to do with her life.  The role of Paige is played first by Monique Lanier who has a softness and sweetness in the character.  She is replaced from the second season on by Tracey Needham.  Paige has a special relationship with Corky, and she has the usual big-sister/little-sister issues with Becca.  She also begins the show with an estranged relationship with Libby.Corky is the oldest son who is suddenly moved from attending a special school to a public school, as he is high-functioning, and the Thachers feel he is entitled to a ""regular"" education as they attempt to mainstream him.  Corky finds himself the target of many high school taunts and practical jokes (particularly Russo).  Tyler Benchfield is, at first, Corky's only friend.  Tyler is a jock who has a special place in his heart for Corky, as we discover that Tyler has a brother with down-syndrome also.  Tyler attempts to protect Corky and to help him fit in.  Becca, the youngest daughter, is not thrilled at having Corky at her school, but quickly changes her tune.Kellie Martin would soon take center stage in Life Goes On.  Her acting ability is tremendous, and the writers quickly discover that the meat of their story is in the character of Becca (Rebecca) Thacher.  She is a brilliant, straight ""A"" student with glasses and skinny legs who dreams of Tyler, her life-long crush.  She's feisty and has a knack for throwing out intelligent comebacks or quips to her parents or to those who try to put her down.  We quickly find that Becca is an intelligent girl with an even bigger heart.  Subsequent seasons will demonstrate this fact when she meets Jesse (Chad Lowe), a boy she quickly falls in love with, but discovers he is HIV+, which sets up one of the most powerful relationship dynamics in television history.This is a show about real values.  This is a show about real problems...money, integrating into high school, issues facing the rearing of a down-syndrome child, broken dreams, etc.  You find as a viewer that you relate with the Thachers.  Their world is far from perfect, but the love is always there, and in the end, it's the most important glue to holding a family together.The entire cast is wonderful.  I loved this show when it was on.  I was sorry to see it go.  Chad Lowe would later win a much deserved Emmy for his performance as Jesse McKenna as Life Goes On would tackle one of the biggest issues in society...AIDS and how it affects a high school boy; how he deals with the prejudices of those around him, and why a ""normal"" girl would want to have anything to do with him.Life Goes On will touch your heart, make you laugh, and make you cry because there is a tenderness and sweetness behind the realism.  Life Goes On proved that family television can do both!",5,Best Family Show of all time comes to DVD...Finally!,1141689600,"03 7, 2006",2006,4756,"['Oh-blah-dee', 'Oh-blie-dah', 'Life', 'Goes', 'grew', 'up', 'many', 'family', 'shows', 'such', 'Little', 'House', 'Praire', 'Waltons', 'so', 'forth', 'Life', 'Goes', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'favorite.Life', 'put', 'realism', 'just', 'touch', 'grit', 'television', 'attempted', 'broadcast', 'families', 'changing', 'times', 'new', 'issues', 'facing', 'teenagers', 'plights', 'American', 'family', 'constantly', 'struggling', 'make', 'do.Life', 'Goes', 'first', 'television', 'series', 'have', 'down-syndrome', 'actor', 'one', 'stars', 'Chris', 'Burke', 'Charles', 'Corky', 'Thacher', 'simply', 'wonderful', 'will', 'see', 'course', 'four', 'seasons', 'how', 'acting', 'range', 'really', 'blossoms', 'was', 'originally', 'going', 'be', 'focal', 'point', 'show.Life', 'Goes', 'Thachers', 'semi-middle', 'class', 'family', 'living', 'Glenbrook', 'Illinois', 'suburb', 'Chicago', 'story', 'hard-working', 'family', 'one', 'plight', 'just', 'life', 'Drew', 'Thacher', 'Bill', 'Smitrovich', 'father', 'who', 'working', 'construction', 'worker', 'tired', 'just', 'getting', 'hard', 'physical', 'labor', 'small', 'checks', 'father', 'who', 'children', 'always', 'trying', 'find', 'way', 'get', 'ahead', 'get', 'top', 'things', 'life-long', 'dream', 'be', 'owner', 'restaurant', 'course', 'first', 'season', 'find', 'out', 'can', 'achieve', 'dream', 'not', 'so', 'what', 'are', 'costs', 'Libby', 'Thacher', 'wonderfully', 'played', 'stage', 'performer', 'Tony', 'award', 'winner', 'Patti', 'Lupone', 'advertising', 'agency', 'run', 'Jerry', 'who', 'favorite', 'character', 'played', 'Ray', 'Butenika', 'Libby', 'tired', 'doing', 'Jerry', 'dirty', 'work', 'taking', 'clothes', 'cleaners', 'washing', 'car', 'getting', 'coffee', 'etc', 'can', 'do', 'more', 'Jerry', 'stingy', 'tries', 'cut', 'financial', 'costs', 'corners', 'wherever', 'Drew', 'daughter', 'first', 'marriage', 'high', 'school', 'bit', 'leaf', 'blowing', 'wind', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'life', 'role', 'Paige', 'played', 'first', 'Monique', 'Lanier', 'who', 'softness', 'sweetness', 'character', 'replaced', 'second', 'season', 'Tracey', 'Needham', 'Paige', 'special', 'relationship', 'Corky', 'usual', 'big-sister/little-sister', 'issues', 'Becca', 'also', 'show', 'estranged', 'relationship', 'Libby.Corky', 'oldest', 'son', 'who', 'suddenly', 'moved', 'attending', 'special', 'school', 'public', 'school', 'high-functioning', 'Thachers', 'feel', 'entitled', 'regular', 'education', 'attempt', 'mainstream', 'Corky', 'target', 'many', 'high', 'school', 'taunts', 'practical', 'jokes', 'particularly', 'Russo', 'Tyler', 'Benchfield', 'first', 'Corky', 'only', 'friend', 'Tyler', 'jock', 'who', 'special', 'place', 'heart', 'Corky', 'discover', 'Tyler', 'brother', 'down-syndrome', 'also', 'Tyler', 'attempts', 'protect', 'Corky', 'help', 'fit', 'Becca', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'not', 'thrilled', 'having', 'Corky', 'school', 'quickly', 'tune.Kellie', 'Martin', 'would', 'soon', 'take', 'center', 'stage', 'Life', 'Goes', 'acting', 'ability', 'tremendous', 'writers', 'quickly', 'discover', 'meat', 'story', 'character', 'Becca', 'Rebecca', 'Thacher', 'brilliant', 'straight', 'A', 'student', 'glasses', 'skinny', 'legs', 'who', 'dreams', 'Tyler', 'life-long', 'crush', 'feisty', 'knack', 'throwing', 'out', 'intelligent', 'comebacks', 'quips', 'parents', 'who', 'try', 'put', 'down', 'quickly', 'find', 'Becca', 'intelligent', 'girl', 'even', 'bigger', 'heart', 'Subsequent', 'seasons', 'will', 'demonstrate', 'fact', 'when', 'Jesse', 'Chad', 'Lowe', 'boy', 'quickly', 'love', 'discovers', 'HIV+', 'up', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'relationship', 'dynamics', 'television', 'history.This', 'show', 'real', 'values', 'show', 'real', 'problems', 'money', 'integrating', 'high', 'school', 'issues', 'facing', 'rearing', 'down-syndrome', 'child', 'broken', 'dreams', 'etc', 'find', 'viewer', 'relate', 'Thachers', 'world', 'far', 'perfect', 'love', 'always', 'there', 'end', 'most', 'important', 'glue', 'holding', 'family', 'together.The', 'entire', 'cast', 'wonderful', 'loved', 'show', 'when', 'was', 'was', 'sorry', 'see', 'go', 'Chad', 'Lowe', 'would', 'later', 'win', 'much', 'deserved', 'Emmy', 'performance', 'Jesse', 'McKenna', 'Life', 'Goes', 'would', 'tackle', 'one', 'biggest', 'issues', 'society', 'AIDS', 'how', 'high', 'school', 'boy', 'how', 'prejudices', 'why', 'normal', 'girl', 'would', 'want', 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'him.Life', 'Goes', 'will', 'touch', 'heart', 'make', 'make', 'cry', 'tenderness', 'sweetness', 'realism', 'Life', 'Goes', 'proved', 'family', 'television', 'can', 'do']",Life Goes On: Season 1
