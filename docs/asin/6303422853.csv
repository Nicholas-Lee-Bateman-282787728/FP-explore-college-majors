The characters appear to be mainly props or mouthpieces for Hartley's witty and caustic repartee. If that was all there was to this perceptive film, one could admire the words but dismiss the film as one would a puppet show. Paying close attantion to what is being said, however, will reveal that the film has great heart and depth and is a mediatation on relationships and the pain of lost love.Two brothers are on the trail of their outlaw, left-over-from-the sixties- radical, father. Along the way, a multitude of serious subjects from politics to sexual exploitation of women to the nature of right and wrong are humorously bantered about by the characters. What truly drives these characters, however, is their utter loss to explain why their relationships constantly fail and cause them so much pain and heartache. The sheriff sums up most of the characters' feelings in a brilliant, stream of consciousness, monologue and says that ""love is like sticking an ice pick through your forehead...Why do I do it?""Hartley's question is what most of us have asked ouselves after a failed relationsship. Why do we keep coming back for more when the result is always pain? One is reminded of a similar theme and question in Woody Allen's ""Annie Hall"".  The answer, of course, is that we need it no matter what the cost; just like we need original filmakers like Hal Hartley who are willing to experiment, take risks and present ideas in innovative and creative ways.",4,Word Games or Art?,1014508800,"02 24, 2002",2002,1584,"['Hal', 'Hartley', 'ultra', 'clever', 'purposely', 'stylized', 'dialogue', 'driven', 'Simple', 'Men', 'exercise', 'clever', 'wordplay', 'characters', 'appear', 'be', 'mainly', 'mouthpieces', 'Hartley', 'witty', 'caustic', 'repartee', 'was', 'there', 'was', 'perceptive', 'film', 'one', 'could', 'admire', 'words', 'film', 'one', 'would', 'puppet', 'show', 'Paying', 'close', 'attantion', 'what', 'being', 'said', 'however', 'will', 'reveal', 'film', 'great', 'heart', 'depth', 'mediatation', 'relationships', 'pain', 'lost', 'love.Two', 'brothers', 'are', 'trail', 'outlaw', 'left-over-from-the', 'sixties-', 'radical', 'father', 'way', 'multitude', 'serious', 'subjects', 'politics', 'sexual', 'exploitation', 'women', 'nature', 'right', 'wrong', 'are', 'humorously', 'bantered', 'characters', 'What', 'truly', 'characters', 'however', 'utter', 'loss', 'explain', 'why', 'relationships', 'constantly', 'fail', 'cause', 'so', 'much', 'pain', 'heartache', 'sheriff', 'sums', 'up', 'most', 'characters', 'feelings', 'brilliant', 'stream', 'consciousness', 'monologue', 'love', 'sticking', 'ice', 'pick', 'forehead', 'Why', 'do', 'do', 'Hartley', 'question', 'what', 'most', 'have', 'asked', 'ouselves', 'failed', 'relationsship', 'Why', 'do', 'keep', 'coming', 'back', 'more', 'when', 'result', 'always', 'pain', 'One', 'reminded', 'similar', 'theme', 'question', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'answer', 'course', 'need', 'matter', 'what', 'cost', 'just', 'need', 'original', 'filmakers', 'Hal', 'Hartley', 'who', 'are', 'willing', 'experiment', 'take', 'risks', 'present', 'ideas', 'innovative', 'creative', 'ways']",Simple Men VHS
373743,A3K74JJXH3QAFS,6303422853,DPK,"[11, 11]","First thing's first, Hal Hartley's films will probably never be everyone's &quot;cup of tea.&quot; That said, he is one of the most gifted film-makers to emerge in the past decade or so. In the same year that yielded such wonderful American movies as &quot;Bob Roberts,&quot; &quot;The Player,&quot; and &quot;Night on Earth,&quot; &quot;Simple Men&quot; stands tall as a wonderful contribution to world cinema.In an interview, Hartley once said that he disputed people saying he wasn't a traditional fim-maker. He argued that he was a traditional film-maker, but that his tradition was people like Bertolt Brecht and Andy Warhol. Evolving from that (alternative) tradition, Hartley is a master of understatement, both as a writer and a director. Because of this, he is often able to reveal simple truths with more emotional impact than many more superficially passionate films. While some of his subsequent films have been more ambitious (and in some ways even better) than this one, &quot;Simple Men&quot; is the one that sticks with me like no other.The film is many things: a road movie, a quest, a love story. It begins as a bookish and somewhat naive son's quest to learn the truth about his father (a noted short-stop and political fugitive). He is accompanied by his older brother, who joins his quest for more material reasons. The quest takes them to a place which feels both completely concrete yet somehow divorced from reality. In this place, the younger brother learns a great deal more about life, while the older brother discovers depths of feeling and commitment within himself that he never imagined he had.Trying to give a literal description of this film's plot would do it an injustice, because that plot is ultimately a means to explore the intriguing characters who make their way through it. Suffice it to say that after watching it, you will be surprised at how moving this film is and how honest it is about the relationships which bind men and women together.",5,There's only trouble &amp; desire.,984441600,"03 13, 2001",2001,1986,"['First', 'thing', 'first', 'Hal', 'Hartley', 'films', 'will', 'probably', 'never', 'be', 'everyone', 'quot', 'cup', 'tea.', 'quot', 'said', 'one', 'most', 'gifted', 'film-makers', 'emerge', 'past', 'decade', 'so', 'same', 'year', 'yielded', 'such', 'wonderful', 'American', 'movies', 'quot', 'Bob', 'Roberts', 'quot', 'quot', 'Player', 'quot', 'quot', 'Night', 'Earth', 'quot', 'quot', 'Simple', 'Men', 'quot', 'tall', 'wonderful', 'contribution', 'world', 'cinema.In', 'interview', 'Hartley', 'once', 'said', 'disputed', 'people', 'saying', 'was', ""n't"", 'traditional', 'fim-maker', 'argued', 'was', 'traditional', 'film-maker', 'tradition', 'was', 'people', 'Bertolt', 'Brecht', 'Andy', 'Warhol', 'Evolving', 'alternative', 'tradition', 'Hartley', 'master', 'understatement', 'writer', 'director', 'often', 'able', 'reveal', 'simple', 'truths', 'more', 'emotional', 'impact', 'many', 'more', 'superficially', 'passionate', 'films', 'subsequent', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'ambitious', 'ways', 'even', 'better', 'one', 'quot', 'Simple', 'Men', 'quot', 'one', 'other.The', 'film', 'many', 'things', 'road', 'movie', 'quest', 'love', 'story', 'bookish', 'somewhat', 'naive', 'son', 'quest', 'learn', 'truth', 'father', 'noted', 'short-stop', 'political', 'fugitive', 'accompanied', 'older', 'brother', 'who', 'quest', 'more', 'material', 'reasons', 'quest', 'place', 'completely', 'concrete', 'yet', 'somehow', 'divorced', 'reality', 'place', 'younger', 'brother', 'great', 'deal', 'more', 'life', 'older', 'brother', 'discovers', 'depths', 'feeling', 'commitment', 'never', 'imagined', 'had.Trying', 'give', 'literal', 'description', 'film', 'plot', 'would', 'do', 'injustice', 'plot', 'ultimately', 'means', 'explore', 'intriguing', 'characters', 'who', 'make', 'way', 'Suffice', 'say', 'watching', 'will', 'be', 'surprised', 'how', 'moving', 'film', 'how', 'honest', 'relationships', 'bind', 'men', 'women', 'together']",Simple Men VHS

All that happened was a bunch of characters, that I cared very little about, said a lot of things that I think were intended to be deep and profound but which I found to be meaningless.This is not my first Hal Hartley film.

373746,A1VJ7HYM1EC94M,6303422853,"G P Padillo ""paolo""","[17, 17]","Hal Hartley never fails to entertain, never fails to engage my mind and emotions on a parallel level.  Simple Men is no exception.  The seemingly simple plot - two brothers in search of their missing dad - provides so much room for character growth that I wish there were an entire series of films centered around them.With a hard-edged view of the world as: ""There's no such thing as adventure. There's no such thing as romance. There's only trouble and desire"" (actually from a Fritz Lang movie of the 1920's) there's plenty going on to both prove and disprove Hartley's ambivalent theories.Simple Men also formally introduces us to the absolutely delicious Elena L&ouml;wensohn.  In one of the coolest and hottest scenes in all of cinema we get to watch her bizarre 50's beatnik-style dance to Sonic Youth's ""Kool thing.""  Then joined by the two lost soul brothers it turns into an unlikely production number.Many dismiss this film, and Hartley as unwatchable or trivial and miss the point.  What is amazing about Hartley is that he takes the seemingly trivial and elevates it to a level of art that, once seen, reflects our lives on every level from brilliance to the inane.Simple Men is pure cinematic delight.Hooray for Hartley!",5,"""Trouble and Desire"" =  Another Terrific Hartley Project",1119312000,"06 21, 2005",2005,1234,"['Hal', 'Hartley', 'never', 'entertain', 'never', 'engage', 'mind', 'emotions', 'parallel', 'level', 'Simple', 'Men', 'exception', 'seemingly', 'simple', 'plot', 'two', 'brothers', 'search', 'missing', 'dad', 'so', 'much', 'room', 'character', 'growth', 'wish', 'were', 'entire', 'series', 'films', 'centered', 'hard-edged', 'view', 'world', 'such', 'thing', 'adventure', 'such', 'thing', 'romance', 'only', 'trouble', 'desire', 'actually', 'Fritz', 'Lang', 'movie', '1920', 'plenty', 'going', 'prove', 'disprove', 'Hartley', 'ambivalent', 'theories.Simple', 'Men', 'also', 'formally', 'absolutely', 'delicious', 'Elena', 'L', 'ouml', 'wensohn', 'one', 'coolest', 'hottest', 'scenes', 'cinema', 'get', 'watch', 'bizarre', '50', 'beatnik-style', 'dance', 'Sonic', 'Youth', 'Kool', 'thing', 'Then', 'joined', 'two', 'lost', 'soul', 'brothers', 'unlikely', 'production', 'number.Many', 'dismiss', 'film', 'Hartley', 'unwatchable', 'trivial', 'miss', 'point', 'What', 'amazing', 'Hartley', 'seemingly', 'trivial', 'level', 'art', 'once', 'seen', 'lives', 'level', 'brilliance', 'inane.Simple', 'Men', 'pure', 'cinematic', 'delight.Hooray', 'Hartley']",Simple Men VHS

373748,AGVWTYW0ULXHT,6303422853,"Nathan Andersen ""Gadget lover and author of S...","[1, 1]","Hal Hartley's best films are intellectual candy.  They are full of provocations and delights, little moments that are both enigmatic and profoundly simple and true.  This one is my favorite, at least so far.  Two men on a search for their father, who may or may not be guilty of a profound wrong or disastrous mistake.  Two women waiting for something or someone.  In outline, the basic plot sounds like any number of Hollywood dramas or romantic comedies, but in this film there is something so fresh about the dialogue with its musical punctuation and simple but unique staging.  The style he employs here, of characters speaking like they were in a soap opera -- not quite acting but emoting and standing as mouthpiece for a play of ideas that is tied to the action -- works when it is subtle and simple as it is in this film (and in others like Henry Fool).  Taken to an extreme it can become a bit annoying, as in Fay Grim which feels just too big and unwieldy to work.  Here it is just right, and at just the right moments is broken by absurdly funny set pieces like a spontaneous musical outburst in response to the Sonic Youth or a cigarette-smoking nun who assaults a police officer.  Hartley is the closest we have to an American Godard.
