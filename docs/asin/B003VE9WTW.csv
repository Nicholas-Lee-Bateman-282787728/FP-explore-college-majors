In this movie there are only two brothers, one is an invalid. If you want great family entertainment, I recommend this for the whole family to see--but if you want a more factual based movie, this isn't going to be the one. That is why I gave it a four star and not a five star. It's a feel good movie and a we succeeded against all odds. Don't plan on seeing it for the true reality of the situation--see it to really enjoy it and how two brothers were able to unite against all odds.",4,Great Family Entertainment,1326499200,"01 14, 2012",2012,586,"['movie', 'loosly', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'reality', 'are', 'two', 'sisters', 'two', 'brothers', 'movie', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'brothers', 'one', 'invalid', 'want', 'great', 'family', 'entertainment', 'recommend', 'whole', 'family', 'see', 'want', 'more', 'factual', 'based', 'movie', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'one', 'why', 'gave', 'four', 'star', 'not', 'five', 'star', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'succeeded', 'odds', 'Do', ""n't"", 'plan', 'seeing', 'true', 'reality', 'situation', 'see', 'really', 'enjoy', 'how', 'two', 'brothers', 'were', 'able', 'unite', 'odds']",N/A

I love the game of baseball and had never seen or heard of this film before so I decided it was worth a shot. I loved the story because I could see my brother and myself doing this same thing! I have spina bifida so I kind of relate to the younger brother in this film in that way and really relate to the older brother as I am an older brother and love the game of baseball.  I recommend this film for people of all ages, whether you love sports or not, it's a great story about two brothers saving their relationship with one another.",5,"A great, little known film",1340236800,"06 21, 2012",2012,582,"['film', 'was', 'one', 'bought', 'kind', 'whim', 'love', 'game', 'baseball', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'heard', 'film', 'decided', 'was', 'worth', 'shot', 'loved', 'story', 'could', 'see', 'brother', 'doing', 'same', 'thing', 'have', 'spina', 'bifida', 'so', 'kind', 'relate', 'younger', 'brother', 'film', 'way', 'really', 'relate', 'older', 'brother', 'am', 'older', 'brother', 'love', 'game', 'baseball', 'recommend', 'film', 'people', 'ages', 'love', 'sports', 'not', 'great', 'story', 'two', 'brothers', 'saving', 'relationship', 'one']",N/A

1367115,A2FF6HVK48D1C0,B003VE9WTW,Tim Williams,"[2, 3]","Family-friendly, but flat, forced and formulaic. ""Chasing 3000"" is loosely based on a true story, but the real brothers never had to travel much more than an hour to see the Pirates. In the movie, they have to travel 2400 hundred miles and their road trip is more bland than beguiling. The best thing about the movie is the archival footage of Hall of Famer Roberto Clemente, but even this is handled clumsily, as the footage sometimes doesn't match the narration. I loved some of the shots of PNC Park, but the closing crowd scenes looked amateurishly faked. Here's hoping that this year's edition of the Pirates fares better than ""Chasing 3000"".",2,Chasing 3 Stars,1342051200,"07 12, 2012",2012,647,"['Family-friendly', 'flat', 'forced', 'formulaic', 'Chasing', '3000', 'loosely', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'real', 'brothers', 'never', 'had', 'travel', 'much', 'more', 'hour', 'see', 'Pirates', 'movie', 'have', 'travel', '2400', 'hundred', 'miles', 'road', 'trip', 'more', 'bland', 'beguiling', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'archival', 'footage', 'Hall', 'Famer', 'Roberto', 'Clemente', 'even', 'handled', 'clumsily', 'footage', 'sometimes', ""n't"", 'match', 'narration', 'loved', 'shots', 'PNC', 'Park', 'closing', 'crowd', 'scenes', 'looked', 'amateurishly', 'faked', 'Here', 'hoping', 'year', 'edition', 'Pirates', 'better', 'Chasing', '3000']",N/A
