The series had enough story lines to go on and on.You have episodes with Matt Smith as the Doctor and cross over episodes with the Slitheen and other creepy crawlies from the Who series. Earlier series have episodes with earlier Doctors.  All are great fun as the youngsters work with Sarah Jane to save the earth.The story of how she &#34;adopted&#34; her son gave some added depth to the series.  All the young actors were excellent and they made a unified troupe who seemed to read each others' minds.If you're a Who fan and you have kids, or if you're just a kid yourself, you'll find the whole series great for a &#34;Saturday afternoon in the rain with popcorn.&#34;  Enjoy!",5,Dr. Who adventures for the younger set...,1396569600,"04 4, 2014",2014,1005,"['have', 'five', 'seasons', 'wonderful', 'show', 'found', 'quite', 'accident', 'library', 'When', 'put', 'together', 'pieces', 'few', 'newer', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'Elisabeth', 'Sladen', 'appeared', 'fell', 'completely', 'love', 'series', 'was', 'so', 'sad', 'lost', 'wonderful', 'actress', 'too', 'soon', 'do', 'five', 'years', 'series', 'had', 'enough', 'story', 'lines', 'go', 'on.You', 'have', 'episodes', 'Matt', 'Smith', 'Doctor', 'cross', 'episodes', 'Slitheen', 'other', 'creepy', 'crawlies', 'Who', 'series', 'Earlier', 'series', 'have', 'episodes', 'earlier', 'Doctors', 'are', 'great', 'fun', 'youngsters', 'work', 'Sarah', 'Jane', 'save', 'earth.The', 'story', 'how', '34', 'adopted', '34', 'son', 'gave', 'added', 'depth', 'series', 'young', 'actors', 'were', 'excellent', 'made', 'unified', 'troupe', 'who', 'seemed', 'read', 'others', 'minds.If', ""'re"", 'Who', 'fan', 'have', 'kids', ""'re"", 'just', 'kid', ""'ll"", 'find', 'whole', 'series', 'great', '34', 'Saturday', 'afternoon', 'rain', 'popcorn.', '34', 'Enjoy']",N/A
