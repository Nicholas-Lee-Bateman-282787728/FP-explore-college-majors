But in reality, we know Ricky And Lehey will never truly be happy so there had to be a reality final episode. Hence the Say goodnight to the bad guy episode.

I really dug getting all the side movies but I have to say this one is the worst.  The quality of the Blu Ray isn't a question to me.  Its produced quite well given the budget and the cameras they were filming on.  My problem is with the story.  Its not my place to say that creator of the series is wrong but it wasn't what I expected or was it?  This was supposed to be the last of the TPBs and it just seemed like a flat ending.  If that's what the director wanted then they did it perfectly.
