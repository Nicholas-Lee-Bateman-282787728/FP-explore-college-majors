627943,A2T2MYZEB81NOQ,B00005JNA7,"Alex K ""Catman""","[4, 8]","This is the best DVD I own so far. Not only is it my favorite show Father Of The Pride (which of course is my favorite A. because I love big cats, and this has the top 4 of them, leopards, jaguars, tigers and of course lions. B. because it is funny and well designed. And C. Because nearly all the characters are beautiful, especially the ones that are female)but it is also on a great DVD with every episode ever made and all kinds of cool stuff throughout all of them. It follows a family of lions with Siegfreid & Roy in Las Vegas, who when off the show have a lot of fun, err, misadventures! They do a lot of funny and enjyable stuff, but often get into a lot of arguments, with one another or with their two married tiger neighbors, who Sarmoti is constantly making fun of and therefore putting the lion family on the tiger's permanent list. Also, there is all sorts of voicework made well and this is just plain a work of gold. I should add a lot more happens in these episodes than just the stuff mentioned up there, but if I told you it would ruin the surprise of this 5 star DVD. Anyway, if you're an animal and/or computer animation lover, this is the DVD of the century for you. I recommend it to all. Rated TV-14 for language, some violence & suggestive content. I completed my review. I'm gonna enjoy this treasure DVD forever.",5,MY FAVORITE SHOW OF ALL TIME IN A GOLD PACKAGE!

NBC tried to distance itself from the show by telling these jokes at a recent press gathering:""The programmer responsible for putting Father of the Pride on NBC last year has now completed rehab.""""Roy Horn calls Father of the Pride the most painful experience of his life.""While FotP was still polluting the airwaves, Cartoon Network offered this suggestion to FotP's writers: ""Try using comedy from 2004 instead of 1962.""And they added that there was no way they'd consider giving the show a second chance (like they did with Family Guy).In fact, the only laugh the show was good for can be found here:[...]I know a lot of people decided to check out this show because the characters were lions and other animals--but the sad fact is that they're really just typical network sitcom people disguised as animals. Emphasis on ""typical"". VERY typical. Oy, I was sick of characters like these years ago. Every aspect of this show is very tired, trite, and completely without any sense of humor or comic timing.NBC at one time hyped the show for its computer-generated animation. Oh, boy, we should watch it for the technology. Sheesh. That's not a sufficient basis for a series, unless you are going to go all-out and dazzle people with what can be done on a computer. And they didn't.At it's heart, good animation is about communication. In classic animation, you can tell a character's emotions, motives, and thoughts in an instant by the visuals: flying to pieces in excitement, turning beet red in embarrassment, or whatever. Have a look at master animator Bruno Bozzetto's online cartoons ([...] is one example)--some of these feature simple circles and rectangles as the characters, but they are still very funny, because Bozzetto still knows how to create characterizations and his writing and timing are top notch.The people who made Father of the Pride don't understand any of that. They might as well have been moving rubber dolls around the screen. There is no humor, no characterization in any of the visuals. Each image seems to be about, ""Look! We can map hair all over their bodies!"" The characters of Siegfried and Roy were downright scary looking, I guess because they didn't have any hair to keep the designers interested. From an animation point of view, the show was painful.I did not find the content of the show as repulsive as some newspaper reviews had reported it--maybe the prevalence of puerile sex humor on TV has jaded me. But I didn't see one thing good in it, either. I was frankly bored by the whole thing. I could name a half-dozen web comics whose creators can draw a more interesting anthro-animal character than any in Father of the Pride (and I was far more impressed with the pencil sketches shown during the ""making of"" short [after the premiere show on NBC] than in the computer-generated final results).It's just a sad, sad show. In terms of comedy, the writing and timing are never better than third-rate, on the rare occasions that it gets that good.And in terms of the point they kept harping on in the promos (""IT'S THE FIRST PRIME-TIME COMPUTER ANIMATED SERIES"") it fails to rise above amateurish.

This is not to say that the rest of the characters aren't great although like Family Guy before it, the show overly relies on the title character and some of the more minor characters, notably the children in the family, are under-developed. The voice cast are brilliant and the animation is very good for TV but obviously doesn't compare to Dreamworks' theatrical outings such as Shrek and Madagascar.Ironically, the weakest episode is the one to feature a guest appearance by Donkey from 'Shrek' - a good example of high-concept, poor execution.I suggest making up your own mind on this one which you will either love or loath.

Davis ""QDog7000""","[0, 0]","I was sitting at my home getting ready to watch a movie from DreamWorks when all of a sudden the ""Father of the Pride"" commercial comes up and it looked so funny I had to check it out. Soon, I order it on Netflix, I watched all of the episodes, and one word...obsesivness. I can't get over this show it is the best animated tv show I have seen when it came out in 2004. It is so funny my family can't stand it, its too funny, but not for the little kiddies. Every episode has a point and a moral and has a very funny conclusion at the end. You wont be dissapointed by it. I showed it to my friends and they love it themselves and they also couldn't get enough of it afterwards. The only things about it is it is very average and it is awkwardly animated and the voices in the show make the story feel kind of strange and more awkward without some key moments of music in it. Like John Goodman, check it out for yourselfs, but I love the gest voices in the show like Eddie Murphy, David Spade, and Lisa Kudrow very funny people. My all time favorite character is the oragotang named Roger who has self esteem issues and gets angered easily watch out for him in the episodes. Good stories and nice jokes that fit perfectlly, what more could you ask for. Buy this DVD if you are over thirteen and you are a fan of the Shrek movies and you love a good twisted and adult sense of humor. I couldn't get rid of this thing for weeks, when I finally had to give it up I immediatley wished for it for Christams and I am expecting it soon. DEFINATELLY buy this DVD you will not regret it.

Every Wednesday morning college students and I would sit in my office and laugh our butts off at this terrific show. NBC simply didn't get it. Even though the ratings were low in its terrible time slot, rather than cancel FotP, why not try another night & time? It seems that unless it's so-called ""reality"" or violence, there's no place for clever, adult television. I still love ""The Simpsons"", but there were way more laughs in FotP then Simpsons have shown in a long time.  So another entertaining show goes the way of Family Guy, Futurama, Firefly, Enterprise...while pandering dreck is allowed to remain. (How many people really found the highly promoted ""Joey"" funny?

So much so they've housed them in a community compound complete with modern conveniences fit for humans, which the animals behave like when Siegfried & Roy aren't present.Sharp and edgy writing propel the episodes in this set which provide a humorous behind-the-scenes look at the off-stage antics of Siegfried & Roy (who typically make the scene to their own theme song, Michael Jackson's ""Mind is the Magic"") and the suburban life of performing white lions Larry (""Roseanne's"" John Goodman), Sarmoti (""The Dick Van Dyke Show's"" Carl Reiner), Kate (""Curb Your Enthusiasm's"" Cheryl Hines) and the other animals of the compound including Larry's best friend Snack the gopher (voice of ""Drumline's"" Orlando Jones).Father of the Pride - The Complete Series features all 14 episodes from the series; 3 never-before-seen episodes including the original pilot; The Lost Tale; Commentaries; Anamorphic Widescreen (1.78:1) video; Dolby Digital 5.1 and 2.0 English audio; Spanish, French subtitles; and is closed captioned for the hearing impaired.
