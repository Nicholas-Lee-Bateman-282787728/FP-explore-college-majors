1375528,A3HP7JU4ZORF52,B003Y5HWGI,Anja Rebekka Schultze,"[3, 4]","Me and my hubby have been fans of Desperate Housewives since season one. I have to admit however that season seven disappointed both of us a little bit. Now do not get me wrong, this season is still good, but it is a little bit different from the other seasons and I am not to thrilled about the changes. Now Desperate Housewives have a pretty wide demographics, and part of the reason for this is that the show have mixed together several themes. You have the drama off course, but you also have allot of humor, at times rather dark humor and in each season there have been a mystery that drives thing along even if drama might not be your cup of tea.Usually each season there is a new neighbor and they have a dark secret which is then slowly revealed over the season's episodes and go through many twists until it is finally solves in the last episode, this however have been completely removed in season seven, there are no mystery, yes there are two villains, but it is revealed to the audience from the get go what their intentions are so there are no mystery there. In addition the dark humor have been reduced, now the episodes is still funny but not as funny as in earlier seasons, it seams that the show's creators have sacrificed everything else to focus on the drama. Now the drama in this season is good, the character's dilemmas is played in a way that make you feel for the character, and if the drama is what you found most attractive about Desperate Housewives then you might like this season better than earlier seasons, however if you are like me and my hubby and it was the mystery plots and the humor which where the most attractive parts of the series then you might become a little disappointed.Now another thing I had a problem with in this season is that the characters seam a bit of. Especially Bree acts a bit out of character, yes she have evolved from the very repressed woman we see in season one, but in this season she sleeps around, find it cute when her date call her a former prostitute to try to inspire a young girl to get out of prostitution and so on. Bree have evolved yes but when we last saw her in season six she was still prim and proper, now she is not, she still dresses the part but do not act it. This at times strange way of handling the characters is the only real flaw as such about this season, the rest I complain about is the producers taking the series in new directions, which I do not agree with, but this slip up when it comes to the behavior of several of the characters and in particularly Bree is distracting as I sit thinking that character would not act that way instead of concentrating on the story.Another change in this season that you may or may not like is that the stories is presented in a story arch fashion. Usually in this series the stories lasted the entire season, and sometime several seasons, and then one episode focused more on one or two of the storylines, in season seven it is more short, few episodes story arks and then that plot get resolved and go away. In a way this makes the series easier to follow and allow for many good little story arks and the producers have done a good job in fitting the small storylines into a whole, I personally however prefers the longer storylines of the other seasons. One thing I did not like however is that at times bombshells are dropped and then never addressed again. I will take one example, spoiler warning, to illustrate my point. Tom's mother comes to live with Lynette and her husband to help take care of the children, then it turns out she is starting to become demented this lead to a crushing scene where Tom is forced to send her to a retirement home and she is never mentioned again. If you are going to build up drama arount a sick family member, follow up on it.This season also introduces a new housewife, a self centered, vain former celebrity wife named Renee. I think this character where very good and I got allot of lengths from her comments and just how this diva tries to fit into suburbia. Renee also have a few good dramatic storylines so I say she is a good addition to the cast of characters.Now from all these complaints you might think I did not like Desperate Housewives season 7, this is not true. Both me and my hubby enjoyed the season. The drama is good, there is still a decent amount of good humor and it continues a very good story from earlier seasons. I am not saying this is not a good season it is, the characters (except for the problems I have already described are good), the actors are brilliant and the series itself is exiting. I just think that this is the weakest season on a great series, that still make the season good, but just not as good as the earlier seasons. I do recommend that you get this DVD set if you are a fan of Desperate Housewives, there is nothing series breaking bad here, but be aware that the tone and structure of the series have gone through some changes and not all of them favorable.",4,A little hit or miss but still good.,1320019200,"10 31, 2011",2011,4984,"['Me', 'hubby', 'have', 'been', 'fans', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'season',

1375529,AW3VZ5O895LRK,B003Y5HWGI,"carol irvin ""carol irvin""","[8, 11]","Update: ABC has cancelled this show, announcing it in August 2011. My review, posted before the announcement follows.I watched this show this season.  I liked it the least of the seven seasons. This show used to have great writing but now the dialogue and plot developments are straight out of afternoon soap operas. Also, the characters who are being emphasized are ones who are now driving me crazy.  And boy, does Teri Hatcher, as Susan lead that pack!  I just wince every time she comes onscreen.  I find her goody two shoes act really tiresome at this point.  Ditto her marriage with Mike. (I used to like him but now I can't stand him either because of her.)I could have done without Vanessa Williams.  If she is supposed to be the new Edie, that didn't pan out.  She's playing a very similar role to the one she played on UGLY BETTY.  Just like Susan, she too is super tiresome. She is a woman used to living in New York who is now living in the burbs and it just doesn't make any sense that she is.The other three are better overall. They are pretty much the characters they have always been. Bree is dating a man much too young for her.  Gabby finds out she has a daughter who is being raised by a lower class Mexican family. Felicity Huffman's Tom becomes a raging success and she can't stand it.  Although this wasn't groundbreaking material, it was at least more like the other six seasons.In an act of pure desperation, Paul Young is returned to the show.  He wants revenge on everyone on the street for being instrumental in sending him to prison. His feud also continues with his arch enemy, who is still in prison.  This is the woman whose sister he killed for being instrumental in his wife's suicide.And on and on we go. I think we are close to the end of the road here and that Wisteria Lane is due for some demolition work, like razing it to the ground, if the writers don't get some better material going with a focus on the remaining three housewives of interest.",3,Formerly Smart Show Has Descended to Soap Opera,1310342400,"07 11, 2011",2011,1985,"['Update', 'ABC', 'cancelled', 'show', 'announcing', 'August', '2011', 'My', 'review', 'posted', 'announcement', 'follows.I', 'watched', 'show', 'season', 'liked', 'least', 'seven', 'seasons', 'show', 'used', 'have', 'great', 'writing', 'now', 'dialogue', 'plot', 'developments', 'are', 'straight', 'afternoon', 'soap', 'operas', 'Also', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'being', 'emphasized', 'are', 'ones', 'who', 'are', 'now', 'driving', 'crazy', 'boy', 'Teri', 'Hatcher', 'Susan', 'lead', 'pack', 'just', 'wince', 'time', 'onscreen', 'find', 'goody', 'two', 'shoes', 'act', 'really', 'tiresome', 'point', 'Ditto', 'marriage', 'Mike', 'used', 'like', 'now', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'either', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'Vanessa', 'Williams', 'supposed', 'be', 'new', 'Edie', 'did', ""n't"", 'pan', 'out', 'playing', 'very', 'similar', 'role', 'one', 'played', 'UGLY', 'BETTY', 'Just', 'Susan', 'too', 'super', 'tiresome', 'woman', 'used', 'living', 'New', 'York', 'who', 'now', 'living', 'burbs', 'just', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'other', 'three', 'are', 'better', 'overall', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'characters', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'Bree', 'dating', 'man', 'much', 'too', 'young', 'Gabby', 'out', 'daughter', 'who', 'being', 'raised', 'lower', 'class', 'Mexican', 'family', 'Felicity', 'Huffman', 'Tom', 'raging', 'success', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'was', ""n't"", 'groundbreaking', 'material', 'was', 'least', 'more', 'other', 'six', 'seasons.In', 'act', 'pure', 'desperation', 'Paul', 'Young', 'returned', 'show', 'revenge', 'everyone', 'street', 'being', 'instrumental', 'sending', 'prison', 'feud', 'also', 'arch', 'enemy', 'who', 'still', 'prison', 'woman', 'sister', 'killed', 'being', 'instrumental', 'wife', 'suicide.And', 'go', 'think', 'are', 'close', 'end', 'road', 'here', 'Wisteria', 'Lane', 'due', 'demolition', 'work', 'razing', 'ground', 'writers', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'better', 'material', 'going', 'focus', 'remaining', 'three', 'housewives', 'interest']",N/A

Vegan,"[6, 9]","I thought Desperate Housewives was so great the first five seasons it was on, making even a five year time jump work, but during it's sixth season it started to falter, and the seventh season was easily the worst yet with messy and uneven plot points and storylines.Since spoilers aren't allowed in reviews, it makes it hard to be very comprehensive, but I didn't like any of Bree's or Lynette's storylines this season, and really hated the way they ended the season with Lynette, found Vanessa William's new character of Renee uneeded and forgotten about most of the time. Though Gabrielle and Susan's stories this season were slightly better, but the entirity of Gabrielle's season, which dominated the first two-thirds or so of the season, was completely forgotten and never mentioned again for the rest of the season, and her season finale ender seemed to be thrown together in a ""what do we do with Gabrielle,"" random way. Susan was the best of the worst, and I really liked her the last few episodes, and how it ended with the villian of the season. Also, there was no real cliff hanger that has me dying to watch the next season.Overall the season did have a few really good episodes, but for the most part, I was very bored with this season, and I think Desperate Housewives is running out of good storylines for the ladies of Wisteria Lane.",3,Uneven and Messy,1305504000,"05 16, 2011",2011,1349,"['thought', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'was', 'so', 'great', 'first', 'five', 'seasons', 'was', 'making', 'even', 'five', 'year', 'time', 'jump', 'work', 'sixth', 'season', 'started', 'falter', 'seventh', 'season', 'was', 'easily', 'worst', 'yet', 'messy', 'uneven', 'plot', 'points', 'storylines.Since', 'spoilers', 'are', ""n't"", 'allowed', 'reviews', 'hard', 'be', 'very', 'comprehensive', 'did', ""n't"", 'Bree', 'Lynette', 'storylines', 'season', 'really', 'hated', 'way', 'ended', 'season', 'Lynette', 'found', 'Vanessa', 'William', 'new', 'character', 'Renee', 'uneeded', 'forgotten', 'most', 'time', 'Gabrielle', 'Susan', 'stories', 'season', 'were', 'slightly', 'better', 'entirity', 'Gabrielle', 'season', 'dominated', 'first', 'two-thirds', 'so', 'season', 'was', 'completely', 'forgotten', 'never', 'mentioned', 'again', 'rest', 'season', 'season', 'finale', 'ender', 'seemed', 'be', 'thrown', 'together', 'do', 'do', 'Gabrielle', 'random', 'way', 'Susan', 'was', 'best', 'worst', 'really', 'liked', 'last', 'few', 'episodes', 'how', 'ended', 'villian', 'season', 'Also', 'was', 'real', 'cliff', 'hanger', 'dying', 'watch', 'next', 'season.Overall', 'season', 'did', 'have', 'few', 'really', 'good', 'episodes', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'very', 'bored', 'season', 'think', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'running', 'good', 'storylines', 'ladies', 'Wisteria', 'Lane']",N/A

""Desperate Housewives"" looks very good on DVD. Outdoor scenes are nice and vibrant, blacks and low-light scenes do not have the excessive noise problems that some series tend to exhibit on a DVD release.For the most part, cinematography for ""Desperate Housewives"" has been excellent and the editing top notch. The series looks great and I can only imagine how beautiful this series would look on High Definition (via Blu-ray).AUDIO:""Desperate Housewives: The Complete Seventh Season - Wild, Wild Wisteria Edition"" is featured in Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound and pretty much, ""Desperate Housewives"" has always been a dialogue-driven television show and is primarily front and center channel driven. For the most part, dialogue is clear and understandable. The show uses minimal music and nor is it the kind of series that utilizes a lot of sound effects (the final episode has a little). For the most part, the setting I preferred to watch the series was to set my receiver setting and have stereo on all channels.The series includes subtitles in English SDH, Spanish and in French.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Desperate Housewives: The Complete Seventh Season"" comes with the following special features:DISC 5:Desperate For Trivia - ""Desperate Housewives"" trivia game.  Use your remote to anwser the correct answers.Growing Up on Wisteria Lane - (9:55)  The young cast who grew up on the set of ""Desperate Housewives"".  The main talent talk about the children they work with on the show.Bloopers - (4:18) ""Desperate Housewives"" season seven outtakes.Deleted Scenes - A total of 12 deleted scenes.EXTRAS:""Desperate Housewives: The Complete Seventh Season - Wild, Wild Wisteria Edition"" comes with a slip cover case.JUDGMENT CALL:Since the fifth season, I felt that the ""Desperate Housewives"" reboot was necessary in establishing a new beginning for the Housewives. As each housewife deals with becoming parents and the story now benefiting from the five year advance, I felt that creator Marc Cherry did what he can to help jumpstart the series.The sixth season was similar to the second season in some ways as a secretive family moves to Wisteria Lane and a strangler was on the loose.  But for this seventh season, ""Desperate Housewives"" goes back to the basics by retaining similar storylines of another creepy person moving into Wisteria Lane (but this time, a familiar face), bringing a new character to the mix as part of the housewives group and last, focusing on the lives of each character.While I did find the seventh season to be entertaining, I do feel that the writers are really trying hard to find ways to put a damper on the life of these housewives.Susan and Mike continue to be a couple who face challenges but this time financial and also a health scare that hits the family hard.But this time around, I feel that the writers wanted to make sure the wives and their families get full coverage and thus we have ex-housewife, Bree involved in two relationships throughout the course of the season.  But the ones that face the most emotional damage is Gabrielle, who finds out that Juanita is not her true blood daughter and when she meets her real daughter, she has a hard time coping.  But to make matters worse is part of her past comes back to haunt her.The character I feel that the writers tried to zero in on is Lynette.  Part of me feels so bad for this character because she had to go through cancer, going back to work and so many other problems that she and her family are constantly have to face.  I was hoping that the writers would at least take it easy with Lynette in the seventh season but I get a feeling that because she is strong-willed and opinionated, she is the character that will be facing extreme difficulties in her marriage.  In some ways, with every character being divorced, you would have hoped Marc Cherry and fellow writers to have at least one person have a good marriage (yes, not perfect but still have a marriage intact).I do feel the addition of Vanessa Williams to the cast is pretty cool.  But in some ways, her character is almost like her diva character on ""Ugly Betty"".  Snooty, uptight and judgmental.  But it's great to see her on the shoe but it's obvious that her character being the newcomer of the group, is not yet being welcomed with open arms.We do know that the next season of ""Desperate Housewives"" will be the final season and I just hope Marc Cherry can at least give closure to fans as many of us have invested into the show for so many years.  And while the series tends to have its good seasons and OK seasons, I have to say that the seventh season was very good.  Hilarious, emotional, entertaining and so many things were introduced this season but with that being said, it's a bit farfetched this time around, especially seeing a riot hit Wisteria Lane.  It's one thing for a tornado or a an airplane but a riot?  I don't know about that.But the riot scene episode was still very entertaining but I do feel that the shocking storylines that the series is known for, wasn't so shocking by the second half of the season.  In fact, the way the series ended made me think of another ABC series, ABC Family's ""Pretty Little Liars"".  It's almost cliche to see something like this happen but at the same time, these women are very good friends and they would always back each other up.I don't know if I agree with the series finale but I can only hope that things work itself out by the final eighth season.As for ""Desperate Housewives: The Complete Seventh Season - Wild, Wild Wisteria Edition"", the DVD set is good, but considering that the last season set and even previous releases had audio commentary, this time around, we only get a few featurettes and that was a bit of a surprise.  I was expecting a bit more in terms of special features.Overall, If you are a fan of ""Desperate Housewives"", then ""Desperate Housewives: The Complete Seventh Season - Wild, Wild Wisteria Edition"" is a good season, just not their best.  Still, if you invested so much time in watching this comedy/drama series, then this seventh season is definitely recommended!",4,"Another entertaining and very emotional season of ""Desperate

Each of these themes link in with whats currently taking place (or what is to take place) in the lives of our Favorite television desperado's. But this season I didn't really get the theme...It looks as if the people who create the concepts for each season's look, this year, went 'we haven't done a western theme before' and decided that this would be the look for season 7, without taking into consideration what actually happens this season, which is more scandal, secrets and LIES (The only show on television that doe's this perfectly and in style).And leading us into another paragraph is a review of the most secretive and revelation-filled seasons yet. Anything you've been wondering about from earlier seasons (one/two) such as 'what happened to that person?' or 'Where is that character now', is answered in season 7. We see the return of Felicia Tillman, Paul young and (only for one or two episodes) Paul's son, Zach Young.

M Pyles,"[8, 11]","Watching the final episode of each season of ""Desperate Housewives"" is like taking that last bite of cheesecake, knowing you should have just said no when the first piece was offered.  You swear you're not going to indulge yourself with such abandon next time, but by noon the next day you're wondering when the bakery will have a fresh batch ready.So what happened this season on Wisteria Lane, that upper-middle-class slice of suburban America that has seen more divorce than Las Vegas, more sex than 42nd Street in the 70's, and more violence than the Balkans?  Well, pretty much the same thing that happened in all the previous seasons.  Good-looking people had illicit sex.  Lots of it.  Marriages strained and sometimes snapped.  Murders were attempted.  Some succeeded.  And Susan perkily - and annoyingly -- stumbled and crashed into and out of one crisis after another.Why, then, do I pre-order every season of this silly series?  Why, once it arrives, do I scarf down all 20+ episodes in five days (or less) of marathon watching?Well, it's like this . . . .  Buried inside each comic book episode are elegiac little pearls of sweet humaneness.  One untenable little scrape after another leaves a character who marched in with self-assured abandon confronting the fact that all our actions have consequences, that the best of intentions can deliver the deepest wounds, that friends matter, and that every day can be a new starting point for trying to do better if you just have a stout heart and sincere desire to be good.Yes, it's fluff.

Or when Gabby asks Lee to use the back door and he shoots back ""I ALWAYS do!"". Little moments like this kept me tuning in. And Teri Hatcher seems less annoying this year as well. Perhaps having her move off the Lane created more sympathy for the character. Lainie Kazan is wonderful as Susan's new landlady who runs a website called Va-Va-Va-Broom, featuring sexy women doing their housework in lingerie. With bills piling up and husband Mike on the verge of taking a job in Alaska, what's a desperate housewife to do but don the garters and heels?The annual ""disaster"" show has in the past brought us a tornado, plane crash and this year comes in the form of a street riot brought on by Paul Young's announcement he's opening a halfway house for ex-cons. And for this episode Wisteria Lane becomes Hysteria Lane and Susan is seriously injured and is faced with a major health crisis.Emily Bergi (Whom I was only familiar with from ""The Rage: Carrie II"") shows up as Paul Young's new wife, a prison groupie who sets up house with Fairview's creepiest citizen but causes tempers to flare when she won't perform her most important wifely duty. Bergi gets more likeable as the season goes on.The wonderful Harriet Samson Harris is back as the twisted Felicia Tillman though sometimes she's only onscreen for five seconds per episode.Now the bad: Vanessa Williams is a tired choice for a new foil. I wish the producers had went with an actress who has been hiding away for awhile rather than someone who just came off a four-year run on ""Ugly Betty"" playing an all-too similar character.Tom and Lynette are having marriage problems AGAIN, due to one of them being jealous of the other's career AGAIN. The writers are running out of ideas fast and it's never been more evident that it is watching this set.The show has already run its course and I am not sure it will be able to sustain itself for an entire season as we approach the final year.

The first four discs contain only episodes, which - when the commercials are removed - run about 42 minutes each. Disc five contains four episodes (including the two-part season finale) plus the Bonus features.The ""Bonuses this time include ""Desperate For Trivia""- a 4  minute rapid-fire segment with the main adult cast members trying to guess answers to questions like ""what was your address on the show?"" and ""what town is Wisteria lane in?"". I did learn one interesting fact about the titles of each episode (though the episode titles are never shown on the broadcast show).Next up is ""Growing Up on Wisteria Lane"", a 10 minute interview segment with the cast of ""kids"" who aged on the show. (Remember there was a ""five-year"" advance forward in on season.). It was a surprise to see how young Andrew van de Camp once looked. Then comes the requisite ""blooper reel"" which only runs four minutes. And the final bonus section is ""Deleted Scenes"", of which there are 12, though they only range from 16 seconds (!) to 1- minutes. And none would change the plots if inserted.So, if you missed this season or want to relive it, this set will serve that purpose. The bonuses are just ""so so"".
