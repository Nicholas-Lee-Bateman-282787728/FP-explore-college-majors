1069572,A28ZZ2UU61TE3U,B000PC1PAM,"Alan B. Fecteau ""65 TOSS-POWER-TRAP !!""","[1, 1]","This is one terrific DVD.If you are a baby boomer from the New England area, or you are just BoSox-curious, you will love this 2-DVD set.Disc 01 features a tremendous 40th anniversary recap of the 1967 season, which appeared last year on the New England Sports Network (NESN).Bonus material on Disc 01 features the original ""Impossible Dream"" show that appeared (in B&W;) on Boston's WHDH-TV, after the 1967 season had finished.  Also included are three segments from the 1967 World Series highlight film, specifically the three wins posted by the Sox.Arguably, Disc 02 is even more interesting than Disc 01.It's a near-complete copy, of the local broadcast, of the next to last game of the 1967 regular season.  The Red Sox hosted the Minnesota Twins in Fenway, needing a win to stay in the race.  The makers of the DVD claim the copy of this game represents the oldest complete-game broadcast available, of any baseball game, that had been telecast in color.  Jose Santiago started for the Red Sox, while Jim Kaat pitched for the Twins.  Early in the contest, Kaat exited the game with an injury, giving way to Jim Perry, brother of Hall-of-Famer Gaylord Perry.  The Sox came from behind, hung on, and won, behind homers by Carl Yastrzemski and George Scott.  Boston went on to take the final game of the season the next day, clinching the flag, behind a complete game effort by Jim Lonborg.Be advised Disc 2 is also available as part of a six-DVD set called ""The Essential Games of Fenway Park.""Just plain great stuff ... get it.",5,THE MAN WE CALL YAZ,1202860800,"02 13, 2008",2008,1532,"['one', 'terrific', 'DVD.If', 'are', 'baby', 'boomer', 'New', 'England', 'area', 'are', 'just', 'BoSox-curious', 'will', 'love', '2-DVD', 'set.Disc', '01', 'tremendous', '40th', 'anniversary', 'recap', '1967', 'season', 'appeared', 'last', 'year', 'New', 'England', 'Sports', 'Network', 'NESN', '.Bonus', 'material', 'Disc', '01', 'original', 'Impossible', 'Dream', 'show', 'appeared', 'B', 'W', 'Boston', 'WHDH-TV', '1967', 'season', 'had', 'finished', 'Also', 'included', 'are', 'three', 'segments', '1967', 'World', 'Series', 'highlight', 'film', 'specifically', 'three', 'wins', 'posted', 'Sox.Arguably', 'Disc', '02', 'even', 'more', 'interesting', 'Disc', '01.It', 'near-complete', 'copy', 'local', 'broadcast', 'next', 'last', 'game', '1967', 'regular', 'season', 'Red', 'Sox', 'hosted', 'Minnesota', 'Twins', 'Fenway', 'needing', 'win', 'stay', 'race', 'makers', 'DVD', 'claim', 'copy', 'game', 'oldest', 'complete-game', 'broadcast', 'available', 'baseball', 'game', 'had', 'been', 'telecast', 'color', 'Jose', 'Santiago', 'started', 'Red', 'Sox', 'Jim', 'Kaat', 'pitched', 'Twins', 'Early', 'contest', 'Kaat', 'exited', 'game', 'injury', 'giving', 'way', 'Jim', 'Perry', 'brother', 'Hall-of-Famer', 'Gaylord', 'Perry', 'Sox', 'came', 'hung', 'won', 'homers', 'Carl', 'Yastrzemski', 'George', 'Scott', 'Boston', 'went', 'take', 'final', 'game', 'season', 'next', 'day', 'clinching', 'flag', 'complete', 'game', 'effort', 'Jim', 'Lonborg.Be', 'advised', 'Disc', '2', 'also', 'available', 'part', 'six-DVD', 'set', 'called', 'Essential', 'Games', 'Fenway', 'Park', 'Just', 'plain', 'great', 'stuff', 'get']",Impossible to Forget: The Story of the '67 Boston Red Sox
1069573,A2YQI7AJYC49AT,B000PC1PAM,"Idaho John ""Idaho John""","[0, 0]","Pretty hard to explain what it is about the 1967 Red Sox that made such an impression on me.  In our home, baseball began and ended with the Yankees and the Red Sox were pretty much forgotten.  But in 1967, I fell in love with baseball, and the Boston Red Sox.  I was raised in Idaho, live in Harmon Killebrew's home town, have never been east of the Mississippi, and probably will never get to Fenway Park in my lifetime - but in 1967 I began to live and die by the Red Sox.  I love this dvd and along with the book ""The 1967 Impossible Dream Red Sox - Nowlin & Desrochers,"" read and viewed together makes the nine year old boy that lives inside this fifty plus something old man so very, very happy.  I love the 2004 team - in fact I play the dvds of the drubbing we gave the Yankees once in a while - there is no end to the satisfaction that comes from seeing the jerks from the Bronx go home with nothing.  But as I write this, I think that this team, this season (1967) was the first time that I really separated myself from my parents and began to realize that I could chose and value something for myself.  And for that, the kid in me is grateful.  Put aside any expectations you might have and just enjoy one of the greatest teams to ever step onto a ball field.",5,my favorite team and my favorite season...,1330992000,"03 6, 2012",2012,1270,"['Pretty', 'hard', 'explain', 'what', '1967', 'Red', 'Sox', 'made', 'impression', 'home', 'baseball', 'began', 'ended', 'Yankees', 'Red', 'Sox', 'were', 'pretty', 'much', 'forgotten', '1967', 'fell', 'love', 'baseball', 'Boston', 'Red', 'Sox', 'was', 'raised', 'Idaho', 'live', 'Harmon', 'Killebrew', 'home', 'town', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'east', 'Mississippi', 'probably', 'will', 'never', 'get', 'Fenway', 'Park', 'lifetime', '1967', 'began', 'live', 'die', 'Red', 'Sox', 'love', 'dvd', 'book', '1967', 'Impossible', 'Dream', 'Red', 'Sox', 'Nowlin', 'Desrochers', 'read', 'viewed', 'together', 'nine', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'fifty', 'something', 'old', 'man', 'so', 'very', 'very', 'happy', 'love', '2004', 'team', 'fact', 'play', 'dvds', 'drubbing', 'gave', 'Yankees', 'once', 'while', 'end', 'satisfaction', 'seeing', 'jerks', 'Bronx', 'go', 'home', 'nothing', 'write', 'think', 'team', 'season', '1967', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'really', 'separated', 'parents', 'began', 'realize', 'could', 'chose', 'value', 'something', 'myself', 'kid', 'grateful', 'Put', 'aside', 'expectations', 'might', 'have', 'just', 'enjoy', 'one', 'greatest', 'teams', 'ever', 'step', 'ball', 'field']",Impossible to Forget: The Story of the '67 Boston Red Sox

The extra features are fun but the main program is a scant 48 minutes and while it has good footage and a nice storytelling to it..ALL of the interviewees are Boston area columnists or politicians NO PLAYERS?!!!  I was so dissapointed to not have YAZ or Jim or Rico or any of them on the program. The extra features are vignettes (that curiously have the odd player interview?) an old documentary of around 48 minutes that is horribly faded and hard to watch and the second disc is a complete game from the final weekend series with the Twins. They mention that it is the OLDEST complete game in baseball available in color...so its a valuable piece of history. Unfortunately it isn't the clincher with Lonborg...but the game the day before...still a valuable curiosity, and the main thing making me not rate this much lower as its cool.Sadly I'm not sure I'll visit this set very often ..if more than once on  most features...",3,good  DVD set...but missing something..THE PLAYERS!!!,1181606400,"06 12, 2007",2007,1140,"['Hi', 'was', 'very', 'anxious', 'get', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'Southern', 'California', 'was', 'big', 'fan', 'Red', 'Sox', 'young', 'fan', 'YAZ', 'Lonborg', 'etc', 'looking', 'forward', '40th', 'Anniversary', 'set', 'extra', 'features', 'are', 'fun', 'main', 'program', 'scant', '48', 'minutes', 'good', 'footage', 'nice', 'storytelling', 'it..ALL', 'interviewees', 'are', 'Boston', 'area', 'columnists', 'politicians', 'PLAYERS', 'was', 'so', 'dissapointed', 'not', 'have', 'YAZ', 'Jim', 'Rico', 'program', 'extra', 'features', 'are', 'vignettes', 'curiously', 'have', 'odd', 'player', 'interview', 'old', 'documentary', '48', 'minutes', 'horribly', 'faded', 'hard', 'watch', 'second', 'disc', 'complete', 'game', 'final', 'weekend', 'series', 'Twins', 'mention', 'OLDEST', 'complete', 'game', 'baseball', 'available', 'color', 'so', 'valuable', 'piece', 'history', ""n't"", 'clincher', 'Lonborg', 'game', 'day', 'still', 'valuable', 'curiosity', 'main', 'thing', 'making', 'not', 'rate', 'much', 'lower', 'cool.Sadly', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', ""'ll"", 'visit', 'set', 'very', 'often', 'more', 'once', 'most', 'features']",Impossible to Forget: The Story of the '67 Boston Red Sox

The recording of the penultimate game of the '67 regular season on the second disc alone makes this 2-DVD set worth buying.  Minnesota fans might also enjoy this look back at the great Twins teams of the 60s, even if this particular game was a loss.The NESN documentary, which is ostensibly the main feature of this video production, is a little over the top in its description of the 1967 season as the birth of ""Red Sox Nation"".  Sports fans who are familiar with Bob Ryan's tendency to characterize everything as the greatest or most incredible something-or-other in the history of organized sports will recognize his influence in the writing. For me, as a Red Sox fan who rooted for Dick Stuart to win the RBI title in 1963 and was thrilled to see Felix Mantilla start at second base in the 1965 All-Star team, all this hype about 1967 got to be a little irritating.Not that 1967 wasn't the greatest and most exciting baseball season in the history of organized sports, however.
