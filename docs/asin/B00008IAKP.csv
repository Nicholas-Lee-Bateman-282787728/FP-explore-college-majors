In the film, he plays a character who got into trouble in the military because he wasn't happy about obeying orders that he considered to be wrong. A period of drugs and alcohol leaves him down on his luck, separated and unable to see his daughter, but there are still a few of his colleagues among the US Marshals who think he has potential. He is assigned to guard a judge who is presiding over a military lawsuit that is related to what appears to be a military plot of some kind. Much of the movie involves the judge not trusting him and not wanting his services but finally coming around after he saves her a couple of times. The story line involving the military misdeeds is a fairly standard conspiracy theory, cover-up plot which mostly seems to serve as way to get the main characters into tight situations in which they build trust and feelings for each other as they try to escape would-be assassins. This movie isn't all that terribly memorable, especially compared to big-budget thrillers like Mission Impossible, but it's certainly watchable, a few weak performances from secondary actors aside.",4,Better than expected but not great,1352505600,"11 10, 2012",2012,1269,"['difficult', 'visualize', 'Bill', 'Pullman', 'down-on-his-luck', 'tough-guy', 'police', 'character', 'relatively', 'decent', 'job', 'pulling', 'off', 'movie', 'film', 'character', 'who', 'got', 'trouble', 'military', 'was', ""n't"", 'happy', 'obeying', 'orders', 'considered', 'be', 'wrong', 'period', 'drugs', 'alcohol', 'down', 'luck', 'separated', 'unable', 'see', 'daughter', 'are', 'still', 'few', 'colleagues', 'US', 'Marshals', 'who', 'think', 'potential', 'assigned', 'guard', 'judge', 'who', 'presiding', 'military', 'lawsuit', 'related', 'what', 'be', 'military', 'plot', 'kind', 'Much', 'movie', 'judge', 'not', 'trusting', 'not', 'wanting', 'services', 'finally', 'coming', 'around', 'couple', 'times', 'story', 'line', 'involving', 'military', 'misdeeds', 'fairly', 'standard', 'conspiracy', 'theory', 'cover-up', 'plot', 'mostly', 'serve', 'way', 'get', 'main', 'characters', 'tight', 'situations', 'build', 'trust', 'feelings', 'other', 'try', 'escape', 'would-be', 'assassins', 'movie', ""n't"", 'terribly', 'memorable', 'especially', 'compared', 'big-budget', 'thrillers', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'certainly', 'watchable', 'few', 'weak', 'performances', 'secondary', 'actors', 'aside']",Ignition

The urgency and intensity in this film is contagious, and leaves you at the edge of your seat.  This film has everything... danger, emotional entanglements, suspense, romance, deception, explosions, and more!  If you like action movies, you'll love this one.  There are many unique and utterly charming scenes here that will make this film worthwhile for anyone's tastes.",5,Exceptional!!!,1051401600,"04 27, 2003",2003,466,"[""'m"", 'huge', 'Bill', 'Pullman', 'fan', 'anyways', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'before', 'would', 'be', 'film', 'urgency', 'intensity', 'film', 'contagious', 'edge', 'seat', 'film', 'everything', 'danger', 'emotional', 'entanglements', 'suspense', 'romance', 'deception', 'explosions', 'more', 'like', 'action', 'movies', ""'ll"", 'love', 'one', 'are', 'many', 'unique', 'utterly', 'charming', 'scenes', 'here', 'will', 'make', 'film', 'worthwhile', 'anyone', 'tastes']",Ignition
742867,A1Z6A5E6VKCMCZ,B00008IAKP,"KitchenSharkMama ""MicahBina""","[0, 0]","The beginning of this mmovie shows Bill Pullman as a Fed who is in bad shape taking drugs but has enough of himself together to stop the bad guys who took out 2 other agents in a transport gone south...and he was wounded at that. He is put on guard detail of a woman that should have been an easy fix on his road to recovery. However it turns out to be the opposite. It is an intense movie with a lot of action and car chase type things. Mr. Pullman was very good in this movie and he stands alone well in this drama after a lot of ensemble cast movies. There are other characters in it and they have their place...but there is no doubts at all about who is running this show, who the star is in this movie! Except for his part as the President in Independence Day he has been the dumped future husband and the boy next door. It is good to see this change of pace for an actor whose talents are far greater than most people give him credit for!I have deliberately left most of the plot and the twists and turns out of this review. I rarely give them. I prefer to stick with the actors performances...no one wants to buy a movie ticket (not at todays rates anyway!) only to have everyone coming out stating they would never have guessed the butler did it! I want to figure it out for myself...",5,Ignition,1341532800,"07 6, 2012",2012,1292,"['beginning', 'mmovie', 'Bill', 'Pullman', 'Fed', 'who', 'bad', 'shape', 'taking', 'drugs', 'enough', 'together', 'stop', 'bad', 'guys', 'who', 'took', 'out', '2', 'other', 'agents', 'transport', 'gone', 'south', 'was', 'wounded', 'put', 'guard', 'detail', 'woman', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'easy', 'fix', 'road', 'recovery', 'However', 'out', 'be', 'opposite', 'intense', 'movie', 'lot', 'action', 'car', 'chase', 'type', 'things', 'Mr.', 'Pullman', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'alone', 'well', 'drama', 'lot', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'movies', 'are', 'other', 'characters', 'have', 'place', 'doubts', 'who', 'running', 'show', 'who', 'star', 'movie', 'part', 'President', 'Independence', 'Day', 'been', 'dumped', 'future', 'husband', 'boy', 'next', 'door', 'good', 'see', 'change', 'pace', 'actor', 'talents', 'are', 'far', 'greater', 'most', 'people', 'give', 'credit', 'have', 'deliberately', 'left', 'most', 'plot', 'twists', 'out', 'review', 'rarely', 'give', 'prefer', 'stick', 'actors', 'performances', 'one', 'buy', 'movie', 'ticket', 'not', 'todays', 'rates', 'anyway', 'only', 'have', 'everyone', 'coming', 'out', 'stating', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'guessed', 'butler', 'did', 'want', 'figure', 'out']",Ignition
