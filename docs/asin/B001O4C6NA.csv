1221815,A2S2JIOVKJ39GE,B001O4C6NA,Bow,"[2, 2]","I love historical mysteries, so am really excited to have found this series. I'm only part way into the second season but already consider myself a fan. Having seen the three original movies made about Inspector Murdoch (starring different actors), it took me a few episodes to get used to the new faces playing the leads.But once I did, I came to view this series as superior to the other version (although I do miss Keeley Hawes). Yannick Bisson captures the sympathetic, mild-mannered character of Murdoch well and his female pathologist sidekick is also well played by Helene Joye.If I had any complaint it would be the fact the series starts out of nowhere, whereas the original movie versions began with Inspector Murdoch's first meeting of Dr. Ogden and we follow along as he first begins grooming Constable Crabtree as a sidekick. I would have preferred this series to start in a similar place but that's a minor thing.Also, as one or two reviewers have noted, this series errs on the side of political correctness a little too often for the era. I always roll my eyes when 19th century characters are portrayed with 21st century values.But over all, this series is good enough to overlook the little things.

Fortunately the first four seasons are free rentals if you purchase Amazon Prime for shipping.

The series is produced in Canada and it has great stories and exceptional writing, excellent acting and directing, top drawer production values, good camera work and special effects, and well matched music.  One of the many things I like about the writing is the clever site and verbal pokes we are given that has us laughing at our and the writers inside jokes.  This often happens when Constable Crabtree (has some of the funniest lines) or another predicts how something will be done or used in the ""future"".  I find it especially entertaining because celebrities of the period and the industrial age inventions and changes to society are at the forefront in inspiring much of how investigations are conducted.

1221835,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B001O4C6NA,C. O. DeRiemer,"[60, 65]","Poor William Murdoch. Will he ever get a fair shake in the casting department? He's a police detective in a number of turn-of the-century mysteries set in gas-lit Toronto written by Maureen Jennings. They are good books, well written, detailed and intricate, and Murdoch is a fine protagonist. He's reasonably well educated, worked rough before he became a policeman and is a Catholic in a very Protestant town which has a largely Protestant police force. Murdoch is convinced that beating a confession out of a suspect -- the usual way of solving a crime -- is not as effective as using deduction and the new scientific methods that are being talked about. He's thoughtful, sincere and shrewd. He's not the most popular copper at his station, but he grudgingly earns the respect of his superior and most of his colleagues.The Murdoch Mysteries is the second attempt by Canadian producers to bring Murdoch to television. The first consisted of three 90-minute programs based on three of Jennings' books. Murdoch's impostor didn't look much like Jennings' description but he was a skilled actor.  It all started well but quickly drifted down into melodrama, with Murdoch in the third program involved with a loving street prostitute. With that highly unlikely development, not in the books, the axe came down on the show.Murdoch Mysteries showed up a couple of years later. It's a conventional television approach with thirteen one-hour mysteries in a season, with two seasons finished and production started on the third. My impression is that the television producers and writers are caught between trying to bring Murdoch and his times to life and having a hit in the ratings. The series, considering that no one in their right mind on this side of the Atlantic is about to spend the kind of budget the BBC used to on production values for a series, looks good enough to be satisfying. The pressure of cranking out 13 mysteries a year is evident in stories that don't leave much time for character development or in plotting mysteries that are complex and don't cheat. The squalor and social injustice Maureen Jennings writes about are largely missing. The writers try for humor by frequently having Murdoch, who loves to apply science to solve crimes, make innocently ironic comments about how such and such an advance - the auto, ballistics, alternating current - might or might not be good for future generations. It's a bit of shtick that wears thin.The weakness, for me, once more lies in the casting of Murdoch. Yannick Bisson is an extremely handsome actor who got his start doing television commercials and then moved into acting. He's 40 but looks younger, with eyes that probably make his lady fans swoon. His eyebrows sometimes have a life of their own. He's not a big man and he has a somewhat light voice. He can play serious but there's not a great deal of gravitas about him. Don't get me wrong; he's not a bad actor. But Murdoch requires a fine actor who can combine thoughtfulness, curiosity, some quiet humor and authority. He's also a man who can handle himself well in a brawl. Bisson, whose career has mainly been in television, reminds me of all those interchangeable and handsome Hollywood television actors who luck out in popular series. He's better than they are, but he doesn't carry much actorly weight.If you like historical mysteries, I recommend trying out this series.

""Murdoch Mysteries, Season One"" breaks the mold by jumping back in time to late 19th-century Toronto, and featuring a detective who used the scientific breakthroughs of the day. It's a fun, clever series overlaid with dark themes, and the only problem is a tendency to be too politically correct.Detective William Murdoch (Yannick Bisson) and pathologist Doctor Julia Ogden (H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Joy) are watching an electrical demonstration when a young woman is killed -- and they soon discover it was murder. And when another person dies by electrocution, Murdoch has to unravel a tangle of motives with the help of Nicola Tesla.It's not Murdoch's last weird case -- a serial killer thought to be dead, a black boxer shot in the heart, a spiritualist who leads him to a dead body, a murdered groom with a secret gay life, a murder seemingly committed by Murdoch's father, a corpse hidden in a theater ceiling, romance and hazing at the rowing club, a creepy ventriloquist who may have committed murder, Irish rebels, an adoptive father murdered for a horrible crime, a killer in a Grim Reaper costume, and a possible Martian invasion.It's not really steampunk, but ""Murdoch Mysteries"" has a very steampunky flavor -- it includes some historical people (Nicola Tesla, Arthur Conan Doyle) and period technology (early motorcycles, airships, forensic equipment). It's as if you had gone back in time to 1890s Toronto, and then created a police-procedural.The mysteries are very well-written, with lots of suspects, motives and sometimes weird methods of committing the crime (how did a man end up hung in a tree when nobody could come near the tree?); the only difficulty was ""Belly-Speaker,"" whose ending is just befuddling. And it's lovely to look at: lots of beautiful Victorian houses, lush hotels, pleasant Canadian countrysides and a sunlit Toronto that looks very pleasant on the outside.The biggest problem with the series is that the writers squirm at the attitudes of the time -- racism and anti-Catholic prejudice are only lightly touched on, and only Brackenreid is anything but tolerant of gays. It feels very anachronistic.Bisson plays Murdoch as a rather uptight, conflicted man with lots of repressed emotions, and whose powers of deduction are rooted in his logical mind and photographic memory. However, he's a bit difficult to warm up to at first because of that. Thomas Craig is quite fun as the blunt, raucous inspector who prefers old-fashioned detecting, while Joy and Jonny Harris make likable sidekicks for Murdoch.""Murdoch Murders Season One"" suffers from some anachronisms, but it's still a thoroughly enjoyable, clever period series -- think a Canadian CSI mingled with a steampunk murder mystery.",4,The mind of Murdoch,1278201600,"07 4, 2010",2010,2776,"['Most', 'police', 'procedurals', 'are', 'very', 'very', 'modern-day', 'Murdoch', 'Mysteries', 'Season', 'One', 'mold', 'jumping', 'back', 'time', 'late', '19th-century', 'Toronto', 'featuring', 'detective', 'who', 'used', 'scientific', 'breakthroughs', 'day', 'fun', 'clever', 'series', 'overlaid', 'dark', 'themes', 'only', 'problem', 'tendency', 'be', 'too', 'politically', 'correct.Detective', 'William', 'Murdoch', 'Yannick', 'Bisson', 'pathologist', 'Doctor', 'Julia', 'Ogden', 'H', 'eacute', 'egrave', 'Joy', 'are', 'watching', 'electrical', 'demonstration', 'when', 'young', 'woman', 'killed', 'soon', 'discover', 'was', 'murder', 'when', 'person', 'electrocution', 'Murdoch', 'unravel', 'tangle', 'motives', 'help', 'Nicola', 'Tesla.It', 'not', 'Murdoch', 'last', 'weird', 'case', 'serial', 'killer', 'thought', 'be', 'dead', 'black', 'boxer', 'shot', 'heart', 'spiritualist', 'who', 'dead', 'body', 'murdered', 'groom', 'secret', 'gay', 'life', 'murder', 'seemingly', 'committed', 'Murdoch', 'father', 'corpse', 'hidden', 'theater', 'ceiling', 'romance', 'hazing', 'rowing', 'club', 'creepy', 'ventriloquist', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'committed', 'murder', 'Irish', 'rebels', 'adoptive', 'father', 'murdered', 'horrible', 'crime', 'killer', 'Grim', 'Reaper', 'costume', 'possible', 'Martian', 'invasion.It', 'not', 'really', 'steampunk', 'Murdoch', 'Mysteries', 'very', 'steampunky', 'flavor', 'historical', 'people', 'Nicola', 'Tesla', 'Arthur', 'Conan', 'Doyle', 'period', 'technology', 'early', 'motorcycles', 'airships', 'forensic', 'equipment', 'had', 'gone', 'back', 'time', '1890s', 'Toronto', 'then', 'created', 'police-procedural.The', 'mysteries', 'are', 'very', 'well-written', 'lots', 'suspects', 'motives', 'sometimes', 'weird', 'methods', 'committing', 'crime', 'how', 'did', 'man', 'end', 'up', 'hung', 'tree', 'when', 'nobody', 'could', 'come', 'tree', 'only', 'difficulty', 'was', 'Belly-Speaker', 'ending', 'just', 'befuddling', 'lovely', 'look', 'lots', 'beautiful', 'Victorian', 'houses', 'lush', 'hotels', 'pleasant', 'Canadian', 'countrysides', 'sunlit', 'Toronto', 'very', 'pleasant', 'outside.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'series', 'writers', 'squirm', 'attitudes', 'time', 'racism', 'anti-Catholic', 'prejudice', 'are', 'only', 'lightly', 'touched', 'only', 'Brackenreid', 'anything', 'tolerant', 'gays', 'very', 'anachronistic.Bisson', 'plays', 'Murdoch', 'rather', 'uptight', 'conflicted', 'man', 'lots', 'repressed', 'emotions', 'powers', 'deduction', 'are', 'rooted', 'logical', 'mind', 'photographic', 'memory', 'However', 'bit', 'difficult', 'warm', 'up', 'first', 'Thomas', 'Craig', 'quite', 'fun', 'blunt', 'raucous', 'inspector', 'who', 'old-fashioned', 'detecting', 'Joy', 'Jonny', 'Harris', 'make', 'likable', 'sidekicks', 'Murdoch', 'Murdoch', 'Murders', 'Season', 'One', 'anachronisms', 'still', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'clever', 'period', 'series', 'think', 'Canadian', 'CSI', 'mingled', 'steampunk', 'murder', 'mystery']","Murdoch Mysteries, Season One"

Filmed in Toronto & Hamilton, Canada.Murdoch seems to have the fortune to be on hand when technological advancements are made, or scientific discoveries are born.  With a bit of tongue-in-cheek, these astonishing breakthroughs assist Murdoch's investigations.Waiting for the next bit of gadgetry is as exciting as watching Murdoch and Toronto's 4th police station solve crimes. These murders carry with them the occasional scenes that cause mirth, smiles, and laughs.  Many of today's routine crime investigation techniques were originated, or at least often used, by Murdoch.  Such as fingermarks, time line analysis, ballistics, lie detection, etc.13 46-minute Episode details:1 POWER Miss Toronto Elec. & Light gets electrically struck down. Who? Why?2 GLASS CEILING A trunk delivered to Station #4 contains a body. Will the inspector be next?3 KNOCKDOWN A black boxer is shot.

Sherlock Holmes creator, Doyle, assists this search.5 TIL DEATH DO US PART Wedding day death in the church office. Inheritance? The intended bride? Murdoch reveals much.6 LET LOOSE THE DOGS Pub argument precedes a death. Murdoch's drinking dad? What's the truth about Murdoch's mom?7 BODY DOUBLE A theater stage catches a body dropping from the ceiling. Not part of Macbeth. Facial reconstruction helps as did finding the hidden......8 STILL WATERS Just prior to Olympic Trials a rower is dead. Coach & rower who was replaced are suspect, but they're just the beginning. A funny lie detector scene with Murdoch attached.9 BELLY SPEAKER Murder by varnish drinking. Who dun it? The belly speaker, ventriloquist, or the dummy? The story takes a twist, after a twist, after a twist. A stellar episode.10 CHILD'S PLAY Industrialist murder, a supporter of homes for orphans.11 BAD MEDICINE This killer is robed, hooded, and shoots crossbow. Robin of the Hood?

This looked familiar to me so I took a chance. It actually wasn't what I was expecting, but it caught my attention.

The usual murder tends to be cleverly done, the sidekick is really trying to learn from Murdoch, and the Boss is a gruff Yorkshireman prone to English terms as &#34;Me old Mucker&#34; maybe he's a Lancashire man? The Lady Doctor is nice and their relationship is heading toward romance.The show is set in Late 19th Century Canada but we are also treated to Murdochs science experiments like &#34;Fingermarks&#34; to help solve crimes, this is certainly not true history but not a bad effort to show times changing.My one quibble is the stock footage between scenes, same shots of same folk walking and tasking and will that little girl ever get to where she's heading. That's the reason for four stars, small issue but could have done better.All in all a pleasant show and I am currently midway through Season 2 but no spoilers. and will watch all available.I believe there were 5 seasons, but as is usual, Kindle is only allowing four as Prime offers.

Girl: ""I didn't think I'd need any."" ; and (4) abortionists are caring, sacrificial individuals who help women (the victims, in fact, of their many poor decisions--this last the worst) at great personal risk--a one sided treatment where the unborn remain voiceless and without a champion.Not just ""boring, PC and insulting"", as another reviewer put it, but simply evil.",1,Evil,1334793600,"04 19, 2012",2012,1158,"['Murdoch', 'Mysteries', 'mockery', 'kinder', 'more', 'decent', 'era', 'portraying', 'christian', 'morality', 'everything', 'wrong', 'world.My', 'wife', 'borrowed', 'series', 'local', 'library', 'could', 'not', 'believe', 'where', 'series', 'was', 'headed', 'innocent', 'episode', '5', 'paean', 'abortion', 'were', 'livid', 'boxed', 'up', 'set', 'be', 'returned.Here', 'just', 'taste', 'what', 'have', 'learned', '1', 'prostitutes', 'are', 'noble', 'government', 'regulation', 'sex-trade', 'good', 'thing', '2', 'temperance', 'movement', 'mischaracterization', 'christians', 'evil', 'typified', 'one', 'practitioner', 'overcompensating', 'garrotter', 'ironic', 'regulating', 'prositution', 'good', 'regulating', 'alcohol', 'bad', '3', '1890', 'sexual', 'mores', 'are', 'effectively', 'different', 'own', 'Guy', 'Did', 'bring', 'protection', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', ""'d"", 'need', '4', 'abortionists', 'are', 'caring', 'sacrificial', 'individuals', 'who', 'help', 'women', 'victims', 'fact', 'many', 'poor', 'decisions', 'last', 'worst', 'great', 'personal', 'risk', 'one', 'sided', 'treatment', 'where', 'unborn', 'remain', 'voiceless', 'champion.Not', 'just', 'boring', 'PC', 'insulting', 'reviewer', 'put', 'simply', 'evil']","Murdoch Mysteries, Season One"

William Murdoch, who applies the known scientific principles of the late 1800s to solve sensational murder cases in the Toronto area. The recurring characters--earnest, cerebral Murdoch; coolly efficient medical examiner Dr. Julia Ogden; irascible old-school Insp. Breckenreid; and eager but sometimes bumbling Constable Crabtree--are all engaging and frequently amusing. The cases sometimes involve social issues as relevant today as they were in the 1890s. Historical figures also appear in some episodes, though liberties are taken with the facts of their lives. For instance, Arthur Conan Doyle's interest in spiritualism did not arise until after WWI.

1222015,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B001O4C6NA,Stephanie De Pue,"[11, 13]","I'm going to call ""Murdoch Mysteries Season One"" a British mystery, although it's set in Canada and uses Canadian actors, because it appears to have been jointly produced by ITV Global Entertainment, and Granada International, two companies surely at least artistically headquartered in Great Britain.  The stylish, contemporary television series, a costumed historical police procedural, is set in the Toronto of the 1890's, and features ""cutting edge Victorian science.""  The boxed set at hand consists of four DVD's comprising 13 episodes, approximately 598 minutes, of the series that debuted in Canada in January, 2008.  And, all praises to Acorn Media, subtitles, in addition to the usual extra features, interviews and such.  It is now available to U.S. audiences for the first time.""Murdoch"" is based on characters from the detective novels of Maureen Jennings: the first published, in 1997,Except the Dying; to be followed by six more in the series.  Jennings is creative consultant on the TV series that aims to give us a look at the dawn of forensic sleuthing.  It was nominated for 14 Geminis in 2008, including Best Dramatic Series, Best Achievement in Casting, and Best Writing.It centers on Detective William Murdoch (Yannick Bisson,Sue Thomas: F.B.Eye (2002 TVseries)), who adopts modern forensic techniques such as ""finger marks,"" and blood spatter analyses, and an early lie detector.  His skeptical, old-school boss Inspector Brackenreid (Thomas Craig,Where the Heart Is); gung-ho prot&eacute;g&eacute; Constable George Crabtree (Jonny Harris, ""Hatching, Matching & Dispatching""); and comely pathologist Dr. Julia Ogden (Helene Joy, ""Durham County"") aid and abet his efforts.  Most of the plots are ingenious, quick-moving, and reasonably original/complex for their length; some do generate emotional power. Some ingenuity has also been invested in bringing a few celebrities of the age to Toronto: famed British mystery author Arthur Conan Doyle; Nikola Tesla, who helped invent electricity and a bunch of other modern gizmos, too; and Price Alfred, son of England's awesome Queen Victoria.  The series is nicely filmed, and its makers haven't stinted on its budget, plenty of people and vehicles in the street and the station.The episodes are: (1) Power; (2) The Glass Ceiling; (3) The Knockdown; (4) Elementary, My Dear Murdoch; (5) Till Death Do Us Part; (6) Let Loose the Dogs; (7) Body Double; (8) Still Waters; (9) Belly Speaker; (10) Child's Play; (11) Bad Medicine; (12) The Rebel and The Prince;(13) The Annoying Red Planet.Unfortunately, aside from Craig as Inspector Brackenreid, the actors don't look or sound Victorian, and Bisson, who plays the title character, is handsome enough, but rather wooden.  There are also some anomalies.  In one episode, we see, in an upper crust home, a print of a world-famous Picasso over the fireplace, in the spot where the household's best picture is generally hung.  Picasso, however, was born in 1881 and had painted neither this famed ""rose period"" portrait, nor anything else, by the 1890's.  Nor did the bourgeoisie even start buying his work before the late 1920's.  Furthermore, surely in the 1890's, and even now, a house-proud woman of any means does not hang a reproduction in the living room, let alone over the fireplace.Never mind: the Toronto ""Globe and Mail"" has called this series ""smart, fast-paced fun.""
