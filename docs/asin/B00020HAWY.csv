It was TEN years ago.Re-live the comedy and drama and romance in the final episode, originally aired on NBC on May 6, 2004 @ 9:00/8:00c.Go back to Central Perk for a cup of coffee and scone for one last time...The Final episode left us with the answer to a 10-year question: will Ross and Rachel end up together? Yes. In the Final episode, Chandler and Monica finally become parents after years of trying, Joey gets a chick and a duck again, named Chick Jr. &amp; Duck Jr., and Phoebe and her husband decide to have kids as well. Who'd thunk their FRIENDShip would last this long and through all the bad, and good stuff? The birth of Phoebe's brother's triplets, the birth of Ross &amp; Rachel's Emma, Chanler and Monica's wedding, and Joey's first real-starring role.This DVD is awesome and it'll help you remember how good these F*R*I*E*N*D*S really are.

820063,ABXPRXMK3Z9GW,B00020HAWY,Anthony Chiu,"[3, 4]","Huge fan of FRIENDS here.  Sure, its a bit too &quot;overated&quot; and those who hate like this show are just sick and tired of its popularity.  Or they expect too much out of a &quot;simple&quot; sitcom!  Its really only a TV show.  This show actually happens to be one of a couple of all shows that I ever watch on TV!Anyway, the acting was definately great, I thought!  But I am never a picky one anyhow.However, I can see that Season 10 is probably one of the most disappointing comparing to Season 3-9 (which are my favourites).  I can only recall a FEW episodes from Season 10 that were good...only one that was REALLY good.As of the Finale, I was hoping for a bit more.  Some viewers are right, there were truly only a few parts of the episode that were humourous.  To sum up, the Finale episode was quite a disappointment for me.  It didn't &quot;complete&quot; FRIENDS as I hoped it to do.  It seemed to me that the show has ended too quickly, and the producers were too much in a hurry to plot the whole episode in a short time frame.  I am a bit surprised some of the characteres didn't even show up (such as Emma, Carol &amp; Susan, Ben, etc.).The best of FRIENDS (according to my own opinion), must definately be within Seasons 4 and 9.  By Season 10, most of the episodes have lost its touch and its humour.  What a shame...",3,"AWESOME TV show, but a disappointing Finale",1088208000,"06 26, 2004",2004,1339,"['Huge', 'fan', 'FRIENDS', 'here', 'Sure', 'bit', 'too', 'quot', 'overated', 'quot', 'who', 'hate', 'show', 'are', 'just', 'sick', 'tired', 'popularity', 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'quot', 'simple', 'quot', 'really', 'only', 'TV', 'show', 'show', 'actually', 'be', 'one', 'couple', 'shows', 'ever', 'watch', 'TV', 'Anyway', 'acting', 'was', 'definately', 'great', 'thought', 'am', 'never', 'picky', 'one', 'anyhow.However', 'can', 'see', 'Season', '10', 'probably', 'one', 'most', 'disappointing', 'comparing', 'Season', '3-9', 'are', 'favourites', 'can', 'only', 'recall', 'FEW', 'episodes', 'Season', '10', 'were', 'good', 'only', 'one', 'was', 'REALLY', 'good.As', 'Finale', 'was', 'hoping', 'bit', 'more', 'viewers', 'are', 'right', 'were', 'truly', 'only', 'few', 'parts', 'episode', 'were', 'humourous', 'sum', 'up', 'Finale', 'episode', 'was', 'quite', 'disappointment', 'did', ""n't"", 'quot', 'complete', 'quot', 'hoped', 'do', 'seemed', 'show', 'ended', 'too', 'quickly', 'producers', 'were', 'too', 'much', 'hurry', 'plot', 'whole', 'episode', 'short', 'time', 'frame', 'am', 'bit', 'surprised', 'characteres', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'show', 'up', 'such', 'Emma', 'Carol', 'amp', 'Susan', 'Ben', 'etc', '.The', 'best', 'FRIENDS', 'according', 'own', 'opinion', 'must', 'definately', 'be', 'Seasons', '4', '9', 'Season', '10', 'most', 'episodes', 'have', 'lost', 'touch', 'humour', 'What', 'shame']",Friends - The Series Finale
820064,A27JBA4I47XJ91,B00020HAWY,Barnaby Twyman,"[4, 7]","I love Friends and have been watching it since the beginning. It's gone on for 10 years which is amazing considering all the cast have stuck together and haven't been replaced by younger stars to keep the show updated. Of course everyone thought the final Friends episode would be the most amazing thing ever seen on television but we were SO wrong!The episode seems really plain and just drags along. They try to build a huge suspense factor with the Ross and Rachel storyline which has been done so many times already. Also you'd think these characters would find more resolution in their lives. I was really dissapointed with how they just blanked Phoebe throughout the episode. We've grown to love her for ten years and the resolution we get is that she's decided to have kids with Mike. That's really worth it! NOT!!! Also where were the guest characters? Janice made her exit earlier in the season but we didn't see Carol, Susan and Ben once! We didn't even see Emma in this episode! Yet Phoebe's annoying husband Mike seems to pop up everywhere throughout the finale. I thought the last shot of the empty apartment was nice it's just that for the rest of the episode you're sitting there thinking ""Ok so when is something big going to happen?"" Finally they never explain Joey's exit to leave for Los Angeles and star in his own show!Season 10 was a rushed season and you can tell by how short it is compared to the other 9. Why were they in such a hurry to finish it? Did they just get bored with writing more new episodes? All in all I think the ending was really poor and lacked any creativity compared to the great endings of Buffy, Sex and the City and Ally McBeal. Hopefully Rachel, Chandler, Monica, Ross and Phoebe will come and visit Joey for an episode in his new show where we'll be satisfied with some big resolution in their lives.As for the reviewer who is complaining about all of Friends not being released in the US as it is in the UK stop whining and head over to amazon.co.uk where you can get them imported legally. The complete seasons 1-5 of Ally Mcbeal, seasons 1-7 of Buffy, seasons 1-4 of Angel and seasons 1-4 of Will & Grace are also available from the same website.",3,A really boring ending to a fantastic show!,1088294400,"06 27, 2004",2004,2199,"['love', 'Friends', 'have', 'been', 'watching', 'beginning', 'gone', '10', 'years', 'amazing', 'considering', 'cast', 'have', 'stuck', 'together', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'replaced', 'younger', 'stars', 'keep', 'show', 'updated', 'course', 'everyone', 'thought', 'final', 'Friends', 'episode', 'would', 'be', 'most', 'amazing', 'thing', 'ever', 'seen', 'television', 'were', 'SO', 'wrong', 'episode', 'really', 'plain', 'just', 'drags', 'along', 'try', 'build', 'huge', 'suspense', 'factor', 'Ross', 'Rachel', 'storyline', 'been', 'done', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'already', 'Also', ""'d"", 'think', 'characters', 'would', 'find', 'more', 'resolution', 'lives', 'was', 'really', 'dissapointed', 'how', 'just', 'blanked', 'Phoebe', 'episode', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'love', 'ten', 'years', 'resolution', 'get', 'decided', 'have', 'kids', 'Mike', 'really', 'worth', 'NOT', 'Also', 'where', 'were', 'guest', 'characters', 'Janice', 'made', 'exit', 'earlier', 'season', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'Carol', 'Susan', 'Ben', 'once', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'see', 'Emma', 'episode', 'Phoebe', 'annoying', 'husband', 'Mike', 'pop', 'up', 'everywhere', 'finale', 'thought', 'last', 'shot', 'empty', 'apartment', 'was', 'nice', 'just', 'rest', 'episode', ""'re"", 'sitting', 'there', 'thinking', 'Ok', 'so', 'when', 'something', 'big', 'going', 'happen', 'Finally', 'never', 'explain', 'Joey', 'exit', 'leave', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'star', 'own', 'show', 'Season', '10', 'was', 'rushed', 'season', 'can', 'tell', 'how', 'short', 'compared', 'other', '9', 'Why', 'were', 'hurry', 'finish', 'Did', 'just', 'get', 'bored', 'writing', 'more', 'new', 'episodes', 'think', 'ending', 'was', 'really', 'poor', 'lacked', 'creativity', 'compared', 'great', 'endings', 'Buffy', 'Sex', 'City', 'Ally', 'McBeal', 'Hopefully', 'Rachel', 'Chandler', 'Monica', 'Ross', 'Phoebe', 'will', 'come', 'visit', 'Joey', 'episode', 'new', 'show', 'where', ""'ll"", 'be', 'satisfied', 'big', 'resolution', 'lives.As', 'reviewer', 'who', 'complaining', 'Friends', 'not', 'being', 'released', 'US', 'UK', 'stop', 'whining', 'head', 'amazon.co.uk', 'where', 'can', 'get', 'imported', 'legally', 'complete', 'seasons', '1-5', 'Ally', 'Mcbeal', '1-7', 'Buffy', '1-4', 'Angel', 'seasons', '1-4', 'Will', 'Grace', 'are', 'also', 'available', 'same', 'website']",Friends - The Series Finale
820065,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B00020HAWY,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[0, 0]","1994. Episode 1. You knew. You just knew. There was a feeling that there was something here. You didn't know what it was going to be, or how it would turn out, but it was there. 10 years later, as the curtain falls for the final time, you are not surprised that it has lasted this long, gained this much success and respect. It was there in the beginning. (...). The finale, coming off of much hype and publicity, is what series finales should be. I am being careful what to say as to not spoil anything for anyone. Of course, the whole world watched, so it might not ruin anything. The adventures of Ross, Rachel, Monica, Chandler, Phoebe, and Joey, are wrapped up in a satisfying send off that showcased the best of the show. It was truly vintage. Being a spoiler junkie, I knew what was to come, but most of it could of been figured out in advance. Loose ends were tied up and everything was wrapped up in a big red bow. Would we want it any other way?. The writing was superb and it handled the festivities as a classic episode, and not like other finales who try so hard to be something special and come off as feeling out of place and out of character. Not this one. It was vintage ""Friends"" through and through. With great little touches like Gunther's confrontation with Rachel, to the chick and duck homage between Joey and Chandler, the writers knew how to give it a little something here and there to touch upon the show's long and celebrated history. The foosball table scenario, disliked by some, was symbolic and overlooked and misunderstood by a lot of people. The same people who probably go after the show for no reason and never actually think beforehand. There was a surprise here and there, but quite frankly, big twists and turns isn't necessary. It would only seem forced and trite, when all you need for the big send off are the characters. The people and the story. That's all. The final moments were sad, and the leaving of the keys was symbolic, touching, and a nice little touch. The actors, some say over-paid and talentless, are, of course, very talented. No one else could be these people. Each with their own quirk and character. They do some great work in the finale. The new beginnings with the babies and the move were brilliantly downplayed by the writers, who knew that while these were special moments, the main focus were on the people themselves. The show could sometimes go for an easy joke, but is that a problem?. No. Like the show itself, the finale was funny, sweet, heartwarming, touching, smart, and comfortable. The show and these characters served the TV viewing audience in a way that the detractors cannot understand. All finales will be reviewed and ripped apart to analyze everything, and it will never satisy everyone, but for me, this one did. They served us well for 10 years, and they gave us a finale that we, and they, all deserved.",5,"""Didn't Think It Would Be This Hard....""",1083888000,"05 7, 2004",2004,2890,"['1994', 'Episode', '1', 'knew', 'just', 'knew', 'was', 'feeling', 'was', 'something', 'here', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'how', 'would', 'turn', 'out', 'was', 'there', '10', 'years', 'later', 'curtain', 'final', 'time', 'are', 'not', 'surprised', 'lasted', 'long', 'gained', 'much', 'success', 'respect', 'was', 'there', 'beginning', 'finale', 'coming', 'much', 'hype', 'publicity', 'what', 'series', 'finales', 'should', 'be', 'am', 'being', 'careful', 'what', 'say', 'not', 'spoil', 'anything', 'anyone', 'course', 'whole', 'world', 'watched', 'might', 'not', 'ruin', 'anything', 'adventures', 'Ross', 'Rachel', 'Monica', 'Chandler', 'Phoebe', 'Joey', 'are', 'wrapped', 'up', 'satisfying', 'send', 'showcased', 'best', 'show', 'was', 'truly', 'vintage', 'Being', 'spoiler', 'junkie', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'come', 'most', 'could', 'been', 'figured', 'out', 'advance', 'Loose', 'ends', 'were', 'tied', 'up', 'everything', 'was', 'wrapped', 'up', 'big', 'red', 'bow', 'Would', 'want', 'other', 'way', 'writing', 'was', 'superb', 'handled', 'festivities', 'classic', 'episode', 'not', 'other', 'finales', 'who', 'try', 'so', 'hard', 'be', 'something', 'special', 'come', 'off', 'feeling', 'place', 'character', 'Not', 'one', 'was', 'vintage', 'Friends', 'great', 'little', 'touches', 'Gunther', 'confrontation', 'Rachel', 'chick', 'duck', 'homage', 'Joey', 'Chandler', 'writers', 'knew', 'how', 'give', 'little', 'something', 'here', 'there', 'touch', 'show', 'long', 'celebrated', 'history', 'foosball', 'table', 'scenario', 'disliked', 'was', 'symbolic', 'overlooked', 'misunderstood', 'lot', 'people', 'same', 'people', 'who', 'probably', 'go', 'show', 'reason', 'never', 'actually', 'think', 'beforehand', 'was', 'surprise', 'here', 'there', 'quite', 'frankly', 'big', 'twists', 'turns', ""n't"", 'necessary', 'would', 'only', 'seem', 'forced', 'trite', 'when', 'need', 'big', 'send', 'off', 'are', 'characters', 'people', 'story', 'final', 'moments', 'were', 'sad', 'leaving', 'keys', 'was', 'symbolic', 'touching', 'nice', 'little', 'touch', 'actors', 'say', 'over-paid', 'talentless', 'are', 'course', 'very', 'talented', 'one', 'else', 'could', 'be', 'people', 'own', 'quirk', 'character', 'do', 'great', 'work', 'finale', 'new', 'beginnings', 'babies', 'move', 'were', 'brilliantly', 'downplayed', 'writers', 'who', 'knew', 'were', 'special', 'moments', 'main', 'focus', 'were', 'people', 'show', 'could', 'sometimes', 'go', 'easy', 'joke', 'problem', 'show', 'finale', 'was', 'funny', 'sweet', 'heartwarming', 'touching', 'smart', 'comfortable', 'show', 'characters', 'served', 'TV', 'viewing', 'audience', 'way', 'detractors', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'finales', 'will', 'be', 'reviewed', 'ripped', 'apart', 'analyze', 'everything', 'will', 'never', 'satisy', 'everyone', 'one', 'did', 'served', 'well', '10', 'years', 'gave', 'finale', 'deserved']",Friends - The Series Finale

I remember the first time I saw Jennifer Aniston on TV, she was like 25 during the first season, and just like every guy in America, I fell in love with her and she made me melt like Velveeta. I had followed her career since then, but she will forever be Rachel. Speaking of Rachel, what a classic hairdo that was. I loved it! If this disc will have the pilot and music video, then it is a great value. By the way my favorite episode of all time is a season one episode, the one where Rachel has to return the ring and it got lost and she was freaking out, ""And now I'm going to have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder!""

Besides, it's just a waste of time to watch the intro videos of the 10 seasons...like 7 minutes of the same, and the music video ""I'll Be There For You"" just sucks!.Pros:However, I own this DVD because the 10th season still hasn't been released in my country, and the extended edition of the finale has lots of really funny parts that don't appear in the broadcasted edition, and it's very funny. Plus, you can watch also the 1st Friends episode ever, which is so, so funny, I think it's one of my favorites so far (I already own 4 complete seasons).Now, to end with this:WHY SOULD I BUY THIS?: Because you want to see the ending and you don't own the 10th season. Because you want to watch the extended version of the finale, which has about 3 minutes with extra scenes (they're so funny). Because you want to watch the first episode, which is very good. Because you're just a collector who owns every single ""Friends"" item there is.WHY SOULDN'T I BUY THIS: Because you own the 1st and 10th season. Because you don't care about the 3 extra minutes in the extended version of the finale. Because the 3 episodes it includes don't worth the money. Because it's boring to watch the intro videos and the music video.======I really like this DVD and I gave it 4 stars because of the extended finale and the first episode.

Over the past ten years, we've watched these six actors grow into the huge stars that they are today and we will never forget them. Even though the show has to end, seeing it end is very heartbreaking because we've been watching it for so long. I, as well as the rest of the fans of this show, feel like that I've grown very close to the six actors. I know that we all can watch the re-runs at 6:00 and 7:00 on the WB mondays thru fridays and 7:30 on TBS mondays thru fridays. We can always watch every episode on our COMPLETE SEASON DVDs, but it's not that same as turning on NBC at 8:00 every thursday night to watch the new episodes.Over the years, we've had so many laughs from our most favorite characters, from RACHEL GREEN to MONICA GELLAR-BING to PHOEBE BUFFAY-HANNIGAN to JOEY TRIBBIANNI to CHANDLER BING to ROSS GELLAR. We've had so many laughs from Janice's annoying OH MY GOD's to Joey's HOW YOU DOIN' to Monica's, I KNOW, to Phoebe's SMELLY CAT, SMELLY CAT WHAT ARE THEY FEEDING YOU. Having to give all those things up is like giving up a part of our lives. When I tune on this thursday to watch my best friends bid their farewell, I'll be wearing black and most likely will have eyes that look like Niagra Falls. We all know that they'll be appearing in more movies, but no matter what movie rolls they take, those rolls will never compare to RACHEL, MONICA, PHOEBE, JOEY, CHANDLER, & ROSS.I just want to thank the six of you guys: JENNFER ANISTON, COURTENEY COX ARQUETTE, LISA KUDROW, MATT LEBLANC, MATTHEW PERRY, & DAVID SCHWIMMER.

I ordered the finale DVD as soon as I saw it as I have the 7-season DVD collection already. It's been a habit of mine to watch the syndicated reruns in the early evening as well as the first-run episodes every Thursday night. I've probably seen each one at least 20 times and never grown tired of them as I have ""Seinfeld."" I think that's a testament to the strength and staying power of this show, the writing, and the actors who have brought it to life for the past 10 years. The show is borderline-genius in so many ways and has made me laugh, cry, feel happy, and feel sad and bonded me to the characters as few other television shows have. I had mixed feelings of contentment and sadness watching the finale and wonder if I'll look forward to watching this DVD as many times as I've watched and enjoyed all the others.

Finally there's some closure.Elsewhere, we see Phobe married to a sweet Mike while Monica and Chandler receive a bundle of joy with a pair of adopted twins which signify another golden moment in the show. Even Matt Le Blanc's character of Joey got a big boost in terms of emotional delivery in the episodes leading to the finale and the finale.It's time to bid farewell when everyone turns in their keys to the apartment, the other landmark set that is central to the show besides Central Perk.

820077,A3L2U581LL17EB,B00020HAWY,Eric,"[4, 6]","For ten seasons, Friends proved to be one of the most endearing and effortlessly likeable sitcoms on television, not necessarily because of great writing (which it did often, though not always, sport), but because of the first-rate cast, which had a mixture of a comic/romantic/dramatic chemistry that I doubt will ever be matched by another television series.The final episode, entitled The Last One, is a fine, if unspectacular, end to the series.  Running at around 45 minutes (sans the commercials), this final episode resolves several subplots that had been running throughout the final season.  Chandler and Monica finally become parents, but with a small surprise that leads to the episode's funniest line, delivered with perfect sarcasm by Matthew Perry.But the resolution most fans want to see is if whether Ross and Rachel get back together.  Their on-and-off relationship has been at times comical, romantic, touching, or just plain annoying, but it works well here.  The last half-hour is built around the typical cliche of man trying to chase after his lover and stop her from leaving his life forever (or in this case, just a long period of time), but the situation delivers plenty of good laughs, especially when, in order to convince Rachel to get off the plane, Phoebe B.S.'s that the plane's left filangee isn't working.The cast has been together for so long that it's hard not to refer to them by their characters' names.  Truthfully, I'm not even certain if anyone of these six can even break away from the character they've been associated with for ten years (certainly not Matt LeBlanc, who'll continue playing Joey next season).

820079,A3UYTW8GXC5EGO,B00020HAWY,Forest Law,"[5, 14]","Friends is a show that has made network television increasingly difficult to watch, because its derivative (albeit highly successful) concept has been duplicated so many times (""Buddies"", ""It's Like, You Know"", and ""Two Guys, A Girl & A Pizza Place"" automatically spring to mind) that it has become a monotonous bore.  The show features witless banter between the characters and plots that are so predictable that anyone over the age of 10 should figure out what's going to happen 5 minutes into an episode (finale included).  It follows such a dull, tired, calculated formula - six friends (tawdry Rachel, whiny Monica, airhead Phoebe, and the fully emasculated Joey, Chandler and Ross) living together in a posh NYC apartment, all mostly working menial jobs.  And we are to believe that they can afford this place on their modest salaries.  Welcome to the world of Friends, featuring a cast that looks like they walked out of a modeling agency - you can't ever expect it to enter the realm of plausibility, now can you?  Which is ironic, considering that the show's fans liken the characters to people that they know and talk about how they can really identify with events that occurred in the series.  Yeah - I'll buy that for a dollar!Besides following a derivative formula, the characters have a trait that betrays their modest backgrounds - they all act like spoiled divas.  Seeing them in action, especially Phoebe with her dopey songs such as ""Smelly Cat"" and Ross (who always seems to be complaining about something) is enough to grate your last nerve.  To think that this show has been placed in the pantheon of great sitcoms such as All In The Family, Seinfeld, the Simpsons and Curb Your Enthusiasm is disappointing - the show isn't nearly as sophisticated, groundbreaking or clever as any of the aforementioned shows.  One episode of Season 10 is (no joke) completely devoted to Chandler and Monica forever moaning and groaning about how much they want to have children - how very stimulating that is.  I did happen to catch the finale of series, and the outcome (which I will not spoil, for anyone that's still interested) was exactly as I expected - the kind of feel-good happy ending that has always been associated with this series.  Call me a cynical pessimist if you will, but the format that this series followed (long bouts of crying and complaining expecting the worst out of a situation, only to be pleasantly surprised with the best possible thing happening EVERY TIME!) was just too hackneyed and artificial - for the life of me, I don't understand why people consider this show to be so true to life.In summary: An unimpressive finale to a lackluster series, Friends - The Series Finale doesn't warrant all of the positive attention and conversation that it has generated.  Content with running the same jokes into the ground and following all of the expected themes, this more or less indicated that the writers/producers/actors were lucky to get so much mileage out of a show that was so devoid of wit or imagination.",1,I never grasped the appeal of this series,1083888000,"05 7, 2004",2004,3045,"['Friends', 'show', 'made', 'network', 'television', 'increasingly', 'difficult', 'watch', 'derivative', 'highly', 'successful', 'concept', 'been', 'duplicated', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'Buddies', 'Know', 'Two', 'Guys', 'A', 'Girl', 'A', 'Pizza', 'Place', 'automatically', 'spring', 'mind', 'become', 'monotonous', 'bore', 'show', 'witless', 'banter', 'characters', 'plots', 'are', 'so', 'predictable', 'anyone', 'age', '10', 'should', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'happen', '5', 'minutes', 'episode', 'finale', 'included', 'dull', 'tired', 'calculated', 'formula', 'six', 'friends', 'tawdry', 'Rachel', 'whiny', 'Monica', 'airhead', 'Phoebe', 'fully', 'emasculated', 'Joey', 'Chandler', 'Ross', 'living', 'together', 'posh', 'NYC', 'apartment', 'mostly', 'working', 'menial', 'jobs', 'are', 'believe', 'can', 'afford', 'place', 'modest', 'salaries', 'Welcome', 'world', 'Friends', 'featuring', 'cast', 'walked', 'modeling', 'agency', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ever', 'expect', 'enter', 'realm', 'plausibility', 'now', 'can', 'ironic', 'considering', 'show', 'fans', 'liken', 'characters', 'people', 'know', 'talk', 'how', 'can', 'really', 'identify', 'events', 'occurred', 'series', 'Yeah', ""'ll"", 'buy', 'dollar', 'following', 'derivative', 'formula', 'characters', 'have', 'trait', 'modest', 'backgrounds', 'act', 'spoiled', 'divas', 'Seeing', 'action', 'especially', 'Phoebe', 'dopey', 'songs', 'such', 'Smelly', 'Cat', 'Ross', 'who', 'always', 'be', 'complaining', 'something', 'enough', 'grate', 'last', 'nerve', 'think', 'show', 'been', 'placed', 'pantheon', 'great', 'sitcoms', 'such', 'Family', 'Seinfeld', 'Simpsons', 'Curb', 'Your', 'Enthusiasm', 'disappointing', 'show', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'sophisticated', 'groundbreaking', 'clever', 'aforementioned', 'shows', 'One', 'episode', 'Season', '10', 'joke', 'completely', 'devoted', 'Chandler', 'Monica', 'forever', 'moaning', 'groaning', 'how', 'much', 'want', 'have', 'children', 'how', 'very', 'stimulating', 'did', 'happen', 'catch', 'finale', 'series', 'outcome', 'will', 'not', 'spoil', 'anyone', 'still', 'interested', 'was', 'exactly', 'expected', 'kind', 'feel-good', 'happy', 'ending', 'always', 'been', 'associated', 'series', 'Call', 'cynical', 'pessimist', 'will', 'format', 'series', 'followed', 'long', 'bouts', 'crying', 'complaining', 'expecting', 'worst', 'situation', 'only', 'be', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'best', 'possible', 'thing', 'happening', 'EVERY', 'TIME', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'hackneyed', 'artificial', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'people', 'consider', 'show', 'be', 'so', 'true', 'life.In', 'summary', 'unimpressive', 'finale', 'lackluster', 'series', 'Friends', 'Series', 'Finale', ""n't"", 'warrant', 'positive', 'attention', 'conversation', 'generated', 'Content', 'running', 'same', 'jokes', 'ground', 'following', 'expected', 'themes', 'more', 'less', 'indicated', 'writers/producers/actors', 'were', 'lucky', 'get', 'so', 'much', 'mileage', 'show', 'was', 'so', 'devoid', 'wit', 'imagination']",Friends - The Series Finale
820080,AHS250YKFTDCQ,B00020HAWY,"Friends Fan ""cal33""","[1, 1]","The finale episode of FRIENDS, which aired on NBC on May 6th and is now available on Collector's Edition DVD, did not disappoint this loyal fan.  I've watched the show since day one, and like so many others, have come to love this sextet of NY pals.With so much hype leading up to the finale episode, my fear was that the show would go the way of SEINFELD, whose finale was a big let down.  FRIENDS, however, stayed true to form.  While the show certainly had it's big moments, the writers and producers didn't try to fill every moment with huge events.  In some ways the finale felt like a regular episode, with funny situations and jokes (like the new chick and duck getting stuck in the fooseball table).  And that's a GOOD thing!It was touching to see Chandler and Joey have their final moment together after years as roommates, talking about the happy times they had playing fooseball.  And of course they wrapped up that scene with one of their famous hugs!Chandler and Monica's surrogate mother having twins--and a boy and a girl, no less!--was touching, although it seemed highly unrealistic that they came home with the babies practically MINUTES after Erica gave birth.  Necessary to speed the episode along, I guess.And of course we all knew the big ending would be Ross and Rachel finally getting together!  The build-up gave us just enough tension to keep us on the end of our seats--Ross not being able to admit how he feels, Gunther finally telling Rachel he loves her (that was sweet), Ross and Phoebe going to the wrong airport, Rachel boarding the plane the first time...up to the moment when Ross's answering machine cuts off Rachel's message!But the moment Rachel walked into Ross's apartment saying, ""I got off the plane..."" was priceless!  It's what we've waited for for the past ten years, ever since the pilot episode when Ross (after pining for Rachel since high school), tentatively asked if he might be able to ask her out sometime.  In the finale, they finally declared that they love each other, were done messing up their relationship, and wanted to be together forever.

820082,A3L6GEJ3DEUGGA,B00020HAWY,"Ian ""een73180""","[2, 2]","I can't even begin to describe Friends. I've been watching that show since I was, like, seven years old. I have successfully seen every episode (except maybe one or two of which I have no knowledge of not having seen).Though imperfect (i.e. Monica and Chandler immediately leaving the hospital, no one else going to the hospital with them, leaving the twins in the apartment and then going across the hall), this episode did definite justice to the entire series, tying most loose ends.Ross and Rachael did get together, but that's no surprise. Monica and Chandler adopted children and it turned out they were twins, but I'm as unsure as you as to how they couldn't have realized that beforehand. Even prior to this episode, we saw the outcome of Janice and in this episode, we saw Gunther - at last - confess his undying love for Rachael. We even got to learn the history of the disappearance of the chick and the duck!The only loose ends I would have liked to have seen get tied up are those of Richard, Chandler, and Phoebe. We never really did find out if Richard found happiness in life sans-Monica. Phoebe never saw her mother during these last episodes. And Chandler seems to have ammends left to be made with his sexually-open mother and his homosexual father.I would also have liked to have seen Monica and Chandler move into their own house and Rachael and Ross get engaged and Joey have gotten on with his moving to LA. Oh yes, and I wished Phoebe and Mike would have had more screentime together as a married couple, and maybe Phoebe get pregant, but that's all just wishful thinking.To wrap things up (I must be boring you), this was not the best Friends episode ever; it was not the funniest, it was not the most dramatic, and it wasn't very romantic - but the times we spend with our friends rarely are, and so it seems that all justice was served towards the tremendous series. I feel like a part of my life has been dead since Chandler jokingly asked ""Where?"" they would get a cup of coffee.Excuse me, I think my keyboard is getting screwed up from all of my tears dripping onto the keys.",5,Great End to a Great Show,1083888000,"05 7, 2004",2004,2105,"['ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'begin', 'describe', 'Friends', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'show', 'was', 'seven', 'years', 'old', 'have', 'successfully', 'seen', 'episode', 'maybe', 'one', 'two', 'have', 'knowledge', 'not', 'having', 'seen', 'imperfect', 'i.e', 'Monica', 'Chandler', 'immediately', 'leaving', 'hospital', 'one', 'else', 'going', 'hospital', 'leaving', 'twins', 'apartment', 'then', 'going', 'hall', 'episode', 'did', 'definite', 'justice', 'entire', 'series', 'tying', 'most', 'loose', 'ends.Ross', 'Rachael', 'did', 'get', 'together', 'surprise', 'Monica', 'Chandler', 'adopted', 'children', 'turned', 'out', 'were', 'twins', ""'m"", 'as', 'unsure', 'how', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'realized', 'beforehand', 'Even', 'prior', 'episode', 'saw', 'outcome', 'Janice', 'episode', 'saw', 'Gunther', 'last', 'confess', 'undying', 'love', 'Rachael', 'even', 'got', 'learn', 'history', 'disappearance', 'chick', 'duck', 'only', 'loose', 'ends', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'get', 'tied', 'up', 'are', 'Richard', 'Chandler', 'Phoebe', 'never', 'really', 'did', 'find', 'out', 'Richard', 'found', 'happiness', 'life', 'sans-Monica', 'Phoebe', 'never', 'saw', 'mother', 'last', 'episodes', 'Chandler', 'have', 'ammends', 'left', 'be', 'made', 'sexually-open', 'mother', 'homosexual', 'father.I', 'would', 'also', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'Monica', 'Chandler', 'move', 'own', 'house', 'Rachael', 'Ross', 'get', 'engaged', 'Joey', 'have', 'gotten', 'moving', 'LA', 'Oh', 'yes', 'wished', 'Phoebe', 'Mike', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'screentime', 'together', 'married', 'couple', 'maybe', 'Phoebe', 'get', 'pregant', 'just', 'wishful', 'thinking.To', 'wrap', 'things', 'must', 'be', 'boring', 'was', 'not', 'best', 'Friends', 'episode', 'ever', 'was', 'not', 'funniest', 'was', 'not', 'most', 'dramatic', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'romantic', 'times', 'spend', 'friends', 'rarely', 'are', 'so', 'justice', 'was', 'served', 'tremendous', 'series', 'feel', 'part', 'life', 'been', 'dead', 'Chandler', 'jokingly', 'asked', 'Where', 'would', 'get', 'cup', 'coffee.Excuse', 'think', 'keyboard', 'getting', 'screwed', 'up', 'tears', 'dripping', 'keys']",Friends - The Series Finale

Messer,"[15, 25]","First I am amazed at the lack of a life some people obviously have that they take the time to write a negative review of a show they obviously do not like.  Why would they even be looking up Friends on a search in the first place.  Sad people living sad hollow little lives indeed.Is the series overrated? I don't think so.  It's solidly written and performed.  And in 10 years fondness develops for the stories and characters.So why then would one bash it?  Well, it is not realistic in any stretch.  The NYC setting isn't portryed realistically.  Probably since the show is filmed in Hollywood. That has been a complaint from the beginning.  But when you take that out and just look at the writing and acting, and then look at almost every other show around today, you see why it has withstood the test of time.  It works. It is fantasy and not to be taken as reality.  So as a form of escapism -- which a sitcom should be by definition -- this is a crown jewel in television history.Did it break new ground like ALL IN THE FAMILY and MASH?  No.  Did it present itself as overblown pretention like SEINFELD? No.  Did it retread a stand up comics limited routine like HOME IMPROVEMENT?

820086,A29CK3R8EIDEJG,B00020HAWY,JJ Stark,"[10, 12]","Our entire family are HUGE fans of FREINDS.  We own all seven seasons which are available on DVD, the first two videos which were released (Top 10 Episodes, Top 10 Fan Favs), as well as the recent Party Pack (released by Target).  So there was no question whether or not we would add the final episode DVD to our collection.  If you're a fan of the show, collect the DVDs or were one of the few who missed it, I encourage you to purchase this DVD.  After all, whether or not you like it or agree, it IS a piece of history (If the final episode of the FUGITIVE had been released 35 years ago - don't you think that would have been a best seller?!!)Of course, the best part about this DVD is that both the original broadcast version AND the unedited version are included - which includes many moments which are even funnier than what aired that night - I really would have preferred to have seen Monica &amp; Chandler's arrival at the hospital that night, instead of Chandler's &quot;church camp&quot; discussion with Erica (walking into the wrong delivery room - classic &quot;Bing&quot;!). The entire opening sequence is different, and it's a shame that these scenes weren't included on that night. (I thought it was a little &quot;jolting&quot; opening the show with the &quot;morning after&quot; instead of seeing what happened immediately after Ross &amp; Rachel's kiss the week before - I was glad to see it on the DVD). If it was a time issue, they should have just made the show 75 minutes that night, instead of the 66 minutes which were shown.  But it is worth the money to have it on this DVD.I had really hoped that the one hour clip show shown before the final episode was going to be included.  In my opinion, this was just as much a part of the final episode, as the final episode itself, so I was disappointed when I found out that it wasn't included.  But I knew this before I even purchased the DVD, so I wasn't really disappointed AFTER I bought it.  I really hope that this episode will be included on the Season 10 Collection.  After all, it had its own title - &quot;The One Before the Final One&quot; - and it includes opening credits, so it appears to &quot;count&quot; as an episode this season.  There were many memorable clips included, and the two montages near the end of the show (one set to ""The Reason"") were beautifully done, and are worth watching over &amp; over again (I actually videotaped the shows that night, and have watched the clip show a couple of times!).I knew before I even purchased the DVD that the only &quot;extras&quot; were the 10 different show openings and the Rembrandts video (which can also be found on both of the earlier videos/DVDs).  I also knew that the pilot episode was going to be included (which can also be found on the very first video/DVD, as well as Season One Collection, so again, I wasn't really disappointed in the DVD itself, and I would definitely recommend that any fan or collector purchase it.  The reason I give it four stars instead of five has nothing to do with the quality of the DVD or its contents.The reason I give it 4 stars is that I believe the clip show should have been included, and would have really preferred to have this episode together with the final episode instead of the pilot.  I'm sure most fans have seen the pilot repeatedly, and highly doubt that most people will turn to this DVD to watch it (if they haven't seen it already).  As I mentioned earlier, it can be found on both The Top Ten Episode video/DVD, as well as the Season One Collection, so I think it was a little pointless to include it here.  And while I guess I see why they include all ten season openings, how many times are fans really going to watch this?  (it gets quite annoying actually after about the 3rd or 4th season!!)  I had actually thought that the final episode would include a ""special"" opening, including a montage of clips of cast, showing how they've changed throughout the years (as they show each cast member's name, instead of showing the 2-3 clips they've shown all season, I thought they might have shown the different clips of each cast member throughout the years and leave out the full cast clips!- similar to what they did include on the DVD, only wrapped up into ONE opening!).In my opinion, that is what would have made this DVD a 5 star DVD, instead of 4 - include the one hour clip show, the broadcast version and the unedited version of the final episode, and an opening with a montage of clips from all ten years, instead of ten separate openings, plus the Rembrandts video.  That would have been ideal, and would have made this Ltd Ed DVD a 5 star release!!Still, I'm thrilled that it was released and so soon after it's airing, and I enjoyed watching what was ""missing"" that night.  It's a nice disc to throw on when you're looking for something ""quick"" to watch (in between reruns this summer!).I'm now looking forward to Seasons 8, 9 and 10 and really, really hope that the clip show will be included on that final Season Collection!!  We all know that videotapes don't last forever, and it would be a shame if the one-hour clip show wasn't included somewhere where fans could watch it over &amp; over again - It's an excellent way to wrap up 10 years of GREAT television into one hour of viewing, and is something I think most fans would appreciate having forever!!",4,Miss my FRIENDS already!

The six of them are extremely dull, unintelligent, promiscuous, superficial and cute. The women are slutty and the men are stupid. You would think that in the period of ten years they will mature into adults but they are the same way at 35 as they were at 25 and possibly at 15. Overall it is a laid back comedy that relaxes the mind, but this is not an example of high moral standards, digmity and respect for one's self and others.

820091,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00020HAWY,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[72, 99]","Well, I suppose there were some &quot;Friends&quot; fanatics who did not tape the series finale last night and who do not already own the pilot episode.  But then I always hold on to the possibility that winged monkeys could come flying out of specific orifice.  Besides, given that the final episode ran over when it appears in syndication in two parts some scenes are going to have to be cut or shortened (I vote for Chandler's discussion with Erica regarding camp) so this will be the only opportunity to have the complete version of &quot;The Last One,&quot; at least until it comes out in the best of the final season and the complete final season DVD collections.I really thought that overall the final season of &quot;Friends&quot; was one of its weakest.  For me the series derailed when Joey fell for Rachel and not because I thought it was a bad idea.  My favorite moments with Matt LeBlanc in the series where his dealing with being in love with Rachel.  But they messed up the timing with the plot line, so by the time they were willing to give it a try it felt forced and ended up with everybody deciding it will not work.  Fortunately the end of the whole sorry affair was excellent, with Rachel wondering why she and Joey cannot do what Monica and Chandler did, and Joey observing that they were much better friends.  The high point of the final season was clearly Phoebe's wedding and most of the rest of it in the last half was geared towards the final episode, so now is the time to render a verdict on &quot;The Last One.&quot;Wisely this episode did nothing to set up the &quot;Joey&quot; spinoff and while the whole baby birds stuck in the foosball table seems like something that make for an entertaining regular episode of &quot;Friends,&quot; it did serve as a rather fitting metaphor for the relationship between Joey and Chandler.  We get another subtle metaphor at the end with the bit with the keys.  Phoebe gets to bounce around between the various plot lines and provides support and/on havoc, which is just more proof that Lisa Kudrow is going to be one of the finest supporting actresses of her generation.The one thing I really wanted for the final episode was for Monica to announce she was pregnant, but that was probably just an extension of my relief that Courtney Cox Arquette finally got pregnant.  I really felt for her having to endure years of pregnancy watches in the tabloids while she not only suffered miscarriages in her personal life but had to deal with her character's infertility problems as well.  The surprise in the delivery room was pretty good and I suppose we should not be surprised that Erica was able to part with her offspring without any of the pathos of Pheobe saying goodbye to her triplets.  Clearly the scenes at the hospital were not intended to be the centerpiece of the finale.The person who stands out in the final episode is obviously David Schwimmer as Ross.  The episode before the finale was the one where Jennifer Aniston's Rachel really got emotional; that episode was more the one where the characters got a chance to say goodbye to each other, leaving it to the finale to say goodbye to the characters and their fans.  After the nice fake out at the end of Act Three, set up by all those preview adds for the finale, Schwimmer, who could often be over the top annoying, gets to the big moment in the life of Ross and nails it, reminding everybody why Rachel was in love with him (although it takes her a while to remember).  Ross also has the best comic moment of the finale when he checks out his answering machine but Aniston's timing and delivery of the episode's best live is just as good.  It is Schwimmer and Aniston that made parts of the series finale special, which is especially impressive when you consider that Ross and Rachel getting back together was what 77% of viewers (according to one poll I saw) wanted.  With such high expectations coming close is a good trick and the moment compares favorable to the emotional highpoint of the series, which was Chandler's proposal to Monica (and visa versa).&quot;The Final One&quot; was written by Marta Kauffman &amp; David Crane, but I am sure everybody on the staff and in the crew had input.  The initial estimate is that 51.1 million tuned in to watch the final episode, which is only two-thirds of the audience reigned in by the finales of &quot;Seinfeld&quot; (76.0) and &quot;Cheers&quot; (80.4), but still good for fourth place (way behind &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; at 105 million viewers) and the most popular entertainment program on television since the last episode of the first &quot;Survivor,&quot; watched by 51.7 million in August 2000.  But if there is one thing that most final episodes prove to us is that they are never totally satisfying, so the idea that the last episode of &quot;Friends&quot; was not a disappointment is a pretty good outcome.",4,What do you mean you missed the finale episode of &quot;Friends&quot;?,1083888000,"05 7, 2004",2004,4897,"['Well', 'suppose', 'were', 'quot', 'Friends', 'quot', 'fanatics', 'who',

It is impossible to meet the demands and expectations of every single nit-picking fan around the world.  Inevitably, no matter what the writers penned for the final episode, some fans would eat it up like sweet apple pie while others looked down their noses at it as though something disgusting on the soles of their shoes.I, as a fan of the show for ten faithful years, accepted the show and the series finale for what it was and have moved on with my life.  One cannot expect a show that has stood on the mountaintop for so many years to remain there for the series finale.  It was a proper end to a show that has given us more than enough memories to last a lifetime.  Even when the writers gave most fans (note how I didn't say ALL fans) what they wanted in the end - Ross and Rachel coming together; Chandler and Monica parenting twins - it still was not enough for some of the fan base.Given the circumstances, the series finale was the culmination of ten years of great work on the show.

Chandler and Monica are at the hospital waiting for the birth of their baby on the day before they move to their new house.  But they might just have a surprise waiting for them.  Meanwhile, Joey has a housewarming present for them, Chick Jr. and Duck Jr.  Phoebe wants to turn the day into a musical.  But the finale wouldn't be complete without another chapter in the Ross/Rachel soap opera we've been following for 10 years.  Rachel's leaving for Paris, and Ross needs to decide if he wants to try to stop her by telling her how he feels.  And with this gang of six involved, you can be sure there will be plenty of laughs.I've been a fan for a few years now, catching up on the show thanks to constant reruns.  And while the show did loose something in the last couple of seasons, I kept watching.  This finale was exactly what this Friends fan was hoping for - plenty of laughs as the gang of six faced some changes in their lives.  It really did feel like starting a new chapter and not a harsh goodbye at all, even if the last couple of scenes were very bitter sweet.  It was especially nice to see a few nods to classic moments from the show, with appearances by Gunther and Mike, Joey's present, and the infamous &quot;We were on a break!&quot; line.With the quick release and low price of this DVD, I wasn't expecting much in the way of extras.  Since my expectations were low, I wasn't disappointed.  The DVD features the broadcast version and an extended version of the finale as well as an extended version of the pilot.  Boy have styles changed in 10 years!  Both episodes feature great sound and clear picture.  It also features the music video for the classic theme and 10 of the opening credits.  As any Friends fan knows, they usually changed them half way through the season, so we're only getting about half here.  But we do get a couple special ones, like the London opening and the Arquette joke.Since I'm sure it won't be long before season 10 hits selves in a complete set, it's really up to you to decide if you want to get this now or wait for the set later.

But the final episode was pretty excruciating, which was probably a good sign that they chose to end the series now rather than later.  Think about TV shows that started off great but whose legacies floundered because they overstayed their welcome: ""Ally McBeal,"" ""The Drew Carey Show,"" ""E.R.,"" ""The West Wing,"" etc.  ""Friends"" has not been very good for a few years now--but not horrible--and they ended the show in the perfect manner to befit their huge fanbase: by FINALLY getting Ross and Rachel together.  But how they arrived at this conclusion during the show was just nauseating.  The whole ""I'm gonna tell her I love her, no, I'm not gonna tell her I love her"" trip to the airport stuff was just a dizzying spectacle delaying the inevitable (who can't predict that Rachel will get off the plane and return to Ross, proclaiming her love?), and provided little satisfaction.  Also, the show's focus on Monica and Chandler's unexpected surprise--twins--shows that they are going to be wonderful parents (I say with the utmost sarcasm).  I was probably more saddened that the foosball table was destroyed than by anything else in the episode!

The more I watch the last episode, the more I notice the actors. Jennifer Aniston keeps her head turned away from the camera during the very last scene, Matt LeBlanc tearing up - it's extremely hard to watch.Every review I've read of this is complaining about the lack of extras. Well, I have three of the DVD box sets, plus this, and only series 4 has tiny extras - that being the video, and a very short feature of the time in London. The DVD boxsets are going to be notorious for not having extras. You lot should be glad of the extras you have. For some reason, there was some good scenes cut out of the broadcast version, so it's great to see them here. I do find that if you mute it, you'll find watching all 10 series of credits much easier to handle! :)What I found disappointing about the final episode was how little Phoebe &amp; Joey had to do with it. Ross, Rachel, Monica and Chandler all had big storylines to be tied up, and it seemed that Phoebe &amp; Joey were just sidelined, and provided the odd joke or two. And Gunther had his storyline tied up too. Phoebe had her main storyline (getting married to Mike) all tied up, and although they mention her having lots of babies with him, there's nothing else to do with them. And Joey will be appearing in the spin-off, although there's no mention of him moving to LA, or wherever he's going.I'm definitely going to miss Friends, and am already well on my way to getting them all on DVD.

We all knew that Monica and Chandler were getting a baby, and the ""twist"" wasn't even that much of a surprise, at least to me (there HAD to be a baby twist, and what else could they have done?).  We also knew that Ross and Rachel had to get back together somehow, or else longtime fans of the show would have staged a coup and overthrown NBC.The problem with the finale was that there were no real surprises.  The Bings became parents in the first 15 minutes, and the rest of the hour-long episode kind of dragged.  The reunion at the end wasn't all that impressive, and the rest of the episode was filled with ""filler"" material that wasn't all that funny.  Also, Phoebe and Joey were hardly featured at all in the episode, and the whole ""ensemble"" mentality of the show was kind of abandoned for the finale.Overall, the final episode wasn't horrible, but I expected a lot more from a show that has given me so many laughs over the years.I think it's brilliant marketing strategy to release this DVD five days after the finale airs on NBC, and people who buy the ""Friends"" DVDs will probably want to get this limited edition collectible.

In other words, it is a keeper. I recorded it last night but will probably buy the DVD since the price is so attractive.Why has Friends lasted so long and been so popular? I expect it is because the characters, like most of us, were good and decent people with flaws. At different times I could identify with either Ross or Joey or Chandler. They gave us something to relate to and to laugh at. (And I don't mean to imply that if you disliked the show it is because you are not a good and decent person. It just means the show didn't rub you the same way.) It doesn't matter whether or not it was a true sit-com or a sit-soap or whatever label one wants to attach. The show worked. The ensemble cast had brilliant comedic timing and consistently were given good material to deliver.

820107,A28LAYQ58MN1K3,B00020HAWY,"Robert Wesley Sager ""Student""","[3, 4]","I have to say that I liked the finale, yet things were rushed. First off, season 10 should have just gotten off on a good start by hooking Ross and Rachel up, they were rushed, this plot line should have been early to mid-season material, not season finale material. The storyline just shows that ratings were the big concern here, not pleasing the nearly 24 million fans who loyally watched the rest of season 10. Nope we had to drawl everyone possible in and keep everyone in &quot;great suspense.&quot; If this were a reality show I would honestly believe that Ross and Rachel would have split by now. Think about the fact that for the past seven years the two haven't dated and found it best to divorce when they married. Even the fact that they had Emma doesn't say much, if they were going to get married to supply Emma with a &quot;normal&quot; family they would have married in season eight or nine. Those three minutes we see the two together they seem more like the two kids in highschool who get in a relationship and break up only days later, not like a couple who planned to spend a life together. I guess we can only hope for the best, I mean they did have to get together or NBC and Bright, Kauffman, Crane would have had a huge problem on their hands. My next problem was not taking Phoebe anywhere. Ok she and Mike decided to start a family but what else are they going to do. I would have liked to see them move next door to Chandler and Monica or something. (Lord knows Janice didn't move there) I just felt more should have been done with her, and anyone notice that past their marriage Mike has been almost non-existant. Next with Joey, thank you, THANK YOU for NOT setting up the spin-off. That would have totally killed the episode, especially if &quot;Joey&quot; fails. As for his storyline, it was nice, because hes getting a spin-off you really don't need an end for him, I like how his ending was handled. Finally, Chanlder and Monica and Jack and Erika. This was the true suprise of the finale. I can never get over Monica's face when she hears she'll be getting twins. The scene reminds me a lot of when Lucy tells Ricky shes pregnant in &quot;I Love Lucy.&quot; It was touching and you can just tell Monica will be raising three kids (sorry Chandler). All in all it wasn't awful, thank God no one went to jail or died or anything, finales aren't supposed to be like that, at least not for a situation comedy.Now as for the DVD. For ten bucks a hit its ok. We get two versions of the finale, the extended somewhere between four and five minutes longer, nothing much is added to the plot however. Most fans already have the pilot one way or another but it is nice to be able to watch that and then go right to the finale. Its amazing that the hair and clothing styles are the only big change in the show, which is a good thing. You can tell when comparing the two episodes the creators knew what they wanted for the characters. The Remembrants video is nice, they really need it on a season set though. The opening clips montage is nice but the theme song can become annoying. I was really hoping they would take each characters opening clips and put them together using the three minute long theme song, and they do have enough for that because each season has somewhere from two to four different openeing clip sequences for each season. The DVD could have had more and I too was disappointed there was not bow but it should NOT be added to the episode. That cheapens the idea of Friends as a show, however it should be on the DVD somewhere. As for all the stuff NBC used to build up the finale, don't expect it on the season ten DVD, unless Warner Brothers owns the rights to those shows. Also, this DVD is in no way limited so you don't have to rush out thinking you may get a copy.

And at that same time Ross' sister Monica (Courteney Cox Arquette) is in the hospital with her husband Chandler (Matthew Perry), when Erica (Anna Faris) is in labor. And she gives birth to a boy, but what neither Chandler, Monica or Erica knows there is another baby yet to be born, but the doctor delievering the baby knows. And Erica thinks the 2 heartbeats are her's and the baby's. And the 2nd baby is a girl, which they name Erica.

Understated and low key but deeply emotional and very classy. I think it was the perfect exit especially the last few minutes when they're all together. There's no way true fans of the show wouldn't be satisfied because it's the perfect closure.But for the detractors of the show who I assume only look at the episode on the comedy perspective would be underwhelmed because this is not the funniest episode ever. Most of the comedy was provided by Kudrow which until the very end is in high form. The strength of the show has always been the relationship of the six friends that made people really care for these characters. If all you think about after watching this episode is that it's not funny enough then maybe you are just really not a fan of the show. To paraphrase the creators this episode was written for the fans of the show.The disc has practically no substantial special feature at all. I mean how about a documentary of the finale, interviews with cast and creators, behind the scenes, commentary? I just hope Season 10 Dvd will have those things and I hope the cast do a commentary for the final episode.Buy it as a souvenir, I mean 10 dollars, come on! This is a piece of history.
