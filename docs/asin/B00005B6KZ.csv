The story had potential and I feel that in the hands of a director such as Spike Lee the movie could have been really good.Several serious issues such as racism, poverty, friendship, love, trust, faithfulness and unfulfilled dreams are touched upon. Acting is also overall not bad. Still, the direction and the screenplay are really poor and the movies felt to my and my wife as a cheap TV drama. None of the characters is particuarly likable, but this is not necessarily a problem. Rather, the story feels patched up and in many instances barely credible. Just to name a few examples, the two main characters develop a ""secret relationship"" but they don't mind spending time together (or yelling) in a courtyard in full view of neighbours. The young and poor Irish girl always looks fresh and clean like a star, with rosy cheeks, nicely cut hair and perfect make up. The ""voice-over"" sounds forced and we never meet the face behind the voice, to the extent that the ending (which I will not reveal) felt rushed and patched up.Overall, as I said, the story had a lot of potential but barely any of it ended up being fulfilled.

I was even more delighted when I found out that it really was based on a true story...the director/writer is Buddy's nephew.Buddy Visalo is a lovable, warm, and bumbling dreamer whose wife Estelle constantly deflates his trial balloons--because she is expected to by her culture and the times they lived in. She wants Buddy to take no chances and would rather he kept a job he hated than try something new and more daring.To realize his dream, Buddy must ignore Estelle and also evict  the pregnant Mary O'Neary from the upstairs of the place where he hopes to start his bar. This eviction pains him greatly. How he assuages his pain and helps her out is the heart and soul of &quot;Two-Family House&quot;.This is a movie about doing good for someone and expecting nothing in return, about trying to fulfill a dream and dealing with the obstacles that are in your way. It is not a complex movie with a hidden agenda and messages tangled up in a lot of gimmickry. There are serious themes treated seriously, but never in a preachy way. It is just uplifting and full of truths with a hero who is Everyman. As one reviewer said ....&quot;Buddy is off on an adventure that surprises even him.

My mother was telling me how good the movie was & I reluctantly sat down to watch it just to make her happy. A little bit into the movie & I was hooked.The movie follows Buddy, a good natured Italian (ok, Italian-American) guy in New York who just wants to build a bar. His wife Estelle thinks that his idea is doomed to fail like so many of his previous schemes & has no problem telling him so. It isn't until he has to evict the squatter upstairs, a sweet single mother named Mary that he decides to help out, that he finds someone who is not only willing to listen to his plans but also give him encouragement.I really did enjoy this movie. It wasn't the greatest movie I've ever seen, but it's something I'd love to watch again & again. (If that makes any sense.)

Gelwasser,"[13, 15]","As a movie fan, every once in awhile, I surprise myself by finding a small, unknown, cinematic treasure, that is truely an enjoyable experience. This seems to be the case, when one night at a sleepless 2am, I found the wonderfully, nostalgic drama, ""Two family House"" on HBO. There is no big budget, ego filled superstar actors, over done special effects or loud explosions. All this film seems to offer up is a moving script and fine, nuanced performances from the actors. ""Two Family House"" takes place in a working class, Italian neighborhood of 1950's Staten Island. Buddy Visalo (Michael Rispoli) is a little guy with big dreams and a plan to fulfill them. He wants to own a bar and fulfill his aspirations of singing in front of an audience. His plan is to buy a two family home, construct and build the bar on the bottom and rent out the second floor to borders to make the venture pay for itself. Unfortunately, his wife, Estelle (Katherine Narducci) dosn't share in his dreams, nor does she have any confidence in her husband being successful at anything. This is a women, who is deeply afraid of being made a laughing stock and is almost obsessed with conforming to the social standards of the neighborhood and community. All is going to plan, until the appearance of the upstairs renters, a married Irish couple expecting a baby. The Irish women, Mary (Kelly Macdonald) gives birth to a mixed-race child. She is subsequently abandoned by her husband and thrown out of the house by Buddy and an insistant, Estelle. Feeling guilty, Buddy secretly helps Mary out and soon a relationship transpires. Mary, a tough and very proud women, turns out to believe in Buddy and his dreams. She helps him realize, what is holding him back in achieving them. It is through his love for her, that Buddy realizes ""who his jailers are"" and how to really change his life. Writer/Director, Raymond De Felitta has created a moving film, with an almost magical tone, based on the true life story of his relatives. This is a smart script about working class people, who share complex emotions. It would be easy for the script to fall into using lazy stereotypes of these people. Instead we get three in-depth character studies of what makes these folks tick. This is especially effective becuase of the great performances, that come from a vey talented cast. All three of the lead actors just make their roles come alive with wonderfully nuanced readings, that brings out both the joy and sorrow that these characters experience. We get to really understand why these people make the descions they make. Finally, mention should be made of the splendid original music soundtrack by Composer, Stephen Endelman. He does a great job of nostalgicaly evoking both the time period and setting of the film. For an evening of wonderful drama, I highly recommend ""Two family House"".",5,A Magical True life Story,1126828800,"09 16, 2005",2005,2861,"['movie', 'fan', 'once', 'awhile', 'surprise', 'finding', 'small', 'unknown', 'cinematic', 'treasure', 'truely', 'enjoyable', 'experience', 'be', 'case', 'when', 'one', 'night', 'sleepless', '2am', 'found', 'wonderfully', 'nostalgic', 'drama', 'Two', 'family', 'House', 'HBO', 'big', 'budget', 'ego', 'filled', 'superstar', 'actors', 'done', 'special', 'effects', 'loud', 'explosions', 'film', 'offer', 'up', 'moving', 'script', 'fine', 'nuanced', 'performances', 'actors', 'Two', 'Family', 'House', 'place', 'working', 'class', 'Italian', 'neighborhood', '1950', 'Staten', 'Island', 'Buddy', 'Visalo', 'Michael', 'Rispoli', 'little', 'guy', 'big', 'dreams', 'plan', 'fulfill', 'own', 'bar', 'fulfill', 'aspirations', 'singing', 'front', 'audience', 'plan', 'buy', 'two', 'family', 'home', 'construct', 'build', 'bar', 'bottom', 'rent', 'second', 'floor', 'borders', 'make', 'venture', 'pay', 'Unfortunately', 'wife', 'Estelle', 'Katherine', 'Narducci', 'dos', ""n't"", 'share', 'dreams', 'have', 'confidence', 'husband', 'being', 'successful', 'anything', 'women', 'who', 'deeply', 'afraid', 'being', 'made', 'laughing', 'stock', 'almost', 'obsessed', 'conforming', 'social', 'standards', 'neighborhood', 'community', 'going', 'plan', 'appearance', 'upstairs', 'renters', 'married', 'Irish', 'couple', 'expecting', 'baby', 'Irish', 'women', 'Mary', 'Kelly', 'Macdonald', 'birth', 'mixed-race', 'child', 'subsequently', 'abandoned', 'husband', 'thrown', 'house', 'Buddy', 'insistant', 'Estelle', 'Feeling', 'guilty', 'Buddy', 'secretly', 'Mary', 'soon', 'relationship', 'Mary', 'tough', 'very', 'proud', 'women', 'out', 'believe', 'Buddy', 'dreams', 'realize', 'what', 'holding', 'back', 'achieving', 'love', 'Buddy', 'who', 'jailers', 'are', 'how', 'really', 'change', 'life', 'Writer/Director', 'Raymond', 'De', 'Felitta', 'created', 'moving', 'film', 'almost', 'magical', 'tone', 'based', 'true', 'life', 'story', 'relatives', 'smart', 'script', 'working', 'class', 'people', 'who', 'share', 'complex', 'emotions', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'script', 'fall', 'using', 'lazy', 'stereotypes', 'people', 'Instead', 'get', 'three', 'in-depth', 'character', 'studies', 'what', 'folks', 'tick', 'especially', 'effective', 'becuase', 'great', 'performances', 'come', 'vey', 'talented', 'cast', 'three', 'lead', 'actors', 'just', 'make', 'roles', 'come', 'alive', 'wonderfully', 'nuanced', 'readings', 'out', 'joy', 'sorrow', 'characters', 'experience', 'get', 'really', 'understand', 'why', 'people', 'make', 'descions', 'make', 'Finally', 'mention', 'should', 'be', 'made', 'splendid', 'original', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'Composer', 'Stephen', 'Endelman', 'great', 'job', 'nostalgicaly', 'evoking', 'time', 'period', 'setting', 'film', 'evening', 'wonderful', 'drama', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Two', 'family', 'House']",Two Family House

You worked, you came home, you ate, you went to bed and then started all over again. You went to dinner and parties with family and friends you knew your whole life and things just carried on in a methodical paced circle.  The breadwinner of the era was just the shlub that worked to support the wife and kids, who was often disuaded by naysayers, or necessity, from dreaming ""too big"".Michael Rispoli, who is tender, tough, loveable and heroic all at once (and very underexposed as an actor), takes us into Buddy's life. He's an everyday ""goomba"", a man's man. He coulda been the next big singing star on television, but ""the wife's"" family and friends, thinking they are saving him in the long run, talk him out of pursuing that dream.  Buddy decides to ""do something"" with his life and begins plans to turn an old house in the neghborhood into a bar, complete with jukebox.  The house has an old Irish drunk, and his pregnant wife Mary, as squatters.Buddy, the misses and their best friend couple, come to the house for a look-see and Mary is in labor. Though ""the wife"" looks on her as trash, she still can't sit by and not help out.  Well, when the baby is born, he's African-American, and the story takes off when the Irish sowse abuses the mother and disappears.  When Buddy feels sorry for her and begins to help her, all of the interesting interconnection of all the characters gets running.Buddy is what we all wish we could be, kind, non-judgemental and Mary is proof that sometimes you can trust and give the best gifts in the world, an understanding ear and soft shoulder to lean on, if just for a moment or two.I don't like to give too much away in reviews, especially when each scene has as much meaning as this Sundance winner does. The fact that it is also true, and the surprising viewpoint is revealed at the end of the film, makes it the kind of movie you check the guide/grid for to see again, now that you know the secret.Metaldiva Sez: This is a much loved addition to my collection and a must have for anyone.

Moore,"[2, 3]","I loved Raymond De Felitta's ""City Island,"" so when I read reviews stating that his earlier film, ""Two Family House,"" was even better, I rented ""Two Family House"" immediately. The reviewers were right; although ""City Island"" is vastly entertaining and beautifully acted, ""Two Family House"" is a cut above it--a little masterpiece, a tiny but flawless gem.Set on Staten Island in 1956, ""Two Family House"" tells the story of Buddy Visalo (Michael Rispoli), an all-American dreamer with a string of failed business ventures and a disapproving nag of a wife (Katherine Narducci). Buddy buys the eponymous, severely dilapidated house with the plan of turning the first story into a tavern and the second into his home. However, Buddy must deal first with O'Neary (Kevin Conway), the drunken, abusive Irishman who is the second story's current tenant, and Mary (Kelly Macdonald), O'Neary's much younger, heavily pregnant wife. And that is really all I should tell you about the plot, to preserve the funny and touching surprises De Felitta has in store. I will tell you that the entire cast is excellent--especially Rispoli as a working-class guy who discovers his humanity even as his wife and friends think he's lost his mind, and Macdonald as a hard-luck young woman confused by Buddy's stumbling efforts to be kind.Reminiscent of both ""Marty"" and ""Moonstruck,"" but with a delicate magic all its own, ""Two Family House"" reminds us that people who seem to be violating community values may in fact be transcending them.

It examines the story of an Italian family, Buddy and Estelle, and the way their lives affect an Irish woman whose husband has left her due to her having a black son.  It is a funny film, heartwarming and cute, slightly slow moving, with wonderful vignettes of the 1950s and the ethnic mish-mash of New York in that period.Buddy is a down on his luck workman who has always dreamed big.  But his businesses have failed: pizza backing, limosine service and finally he has decided to make his house into a bar.  It turns out the house is inhabited by an Irish couple, of whome the husband is an abusive drunkard and the wife turns out to have been pregnant with someone elses baby.

I had never heard of it before, it was pretty good. Being that my great-grandmother was half black and Irish I guess I found some familarity in the story. I could have only imagined the strife that her mother must have dealt with in the early 1900's. It is a shame that one reviewer could be so ignorant, I don't know if the one star represented his/her distaste for interaccial relations or the fact that the woman cheated on her husband? In any event it's a movie... the Irish mother only dealt w/ hardships because of everyone else's ignorance and the fact that she married that man for the wrong reason. You have to find happiness where  you can. If it means going against ""societal"" beliefs to find it then it must be done. Buddy and Mary's character showed courage in the face of ignorance despite the choices they made. Overall the story was put together very well.",4,Very Good,1230249600,"12 26, 2008",2008,1004,"['watched', 'movie', 'accident', 'Cinemax', 'was', 'playing', 'wee', 'hours', 'morning', 'found', 'staying', 'up', 'watch', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'Being', 'great-grandmother', 'was', 'half', 'black', 'Irish', 'guess', 'found', 'familarity', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'only', 'imagined', 'strife', 'mother', 'must', 'have', 'dealt', 'early', '1900', 'shame', 'one', 'reviewer', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'ignorant', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'one', 'star', 'represented', 'his/her', 'distaste', 'interaccial', 'relations', 'fact', 'woman', 'cheated', 'husband', 'event', 'movie', 'Irish', 'mother', 'only', 'dealt', 'w/', 'hardships', 'everyone', 'else', 'ignorance', 'fact', 'married', 'man', 'wrong', 'reason', 'have', 'find', 'happiness', 'where', 'can', 'going', 'societal', 'beliefs', 'find', 'then', 'must', 'be', 'done', 'Buddy', 'Mary', 'character', 'showed', 'courage', 'face', 'ignorance', 'choices', 'made', 'Overall', 'story', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'very', 'well']",Two Family House
