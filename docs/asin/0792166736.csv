Bennett ""Will 'vouge' For Food""","[1, 3]","The main problem with &quot;The Next Best Thing&quot; is that the movie is very flat and some parts leave you thinking &quot;what?&quot;.  The acting was terrific but I didn't feel that Madonna's character and Rupert's  character were best friends at all, in fact Madonna's character was  extremely underdeveloped.  Her not allowing Rupert to see the boy came out  of nowhere, and was totally stupid.  Madonna is a good actress but this  movie won't help that aspect of her career at all.  &quot;The Next Best  Thing&quot; is bogged down in melodramatic nosense that hides it potential  to really make an important statement about the changing reality of  families.  And the ending!  I was so mad-I thought &quot;This is totally  twisted-it is too stupid!&quot;.

However, I wouldn't put all the blame on Madonna. The script was weak and Rupert was just too over the top in his performance.Madonna's husband Guy recently said that she needed a director that would ""direct her."" I think that's a big factor in why her performance was bad in this film; she has too much creative control and forgets to ""act."" Madonna is VERY aware of the camera in this film and it's obvious. For instance, she never, ever looks bad. Even when she's ""sobbing her heart out"" she looks good, which is stupid. I think she should have gotten a red face, smeared her makeup and tried to sound as if she was heartbroken. Not looking all glistening and beautiful with slightly wet eyes.However, it was obvious she's been taking lessons of some sort, because she actually has expressions when she delivers her lines, but, man she needs to forget the camera entirely. Take a good look at ""Desperately Seeking Susan"" and you'll see what I mean. The rumor was the director edited a lot of Madonna's parts out because she just wasn't that good. I can believe it, unfortunately, because she just wasn't acting.The storyline was good and definitely unusual. A woman and a gay man having a baby and then she decides to get married which causes all kinds of problems. But, the script itself was just over the top and bad. Rupert screaming at Madonna, Madonna screaming back and Benjamin just getting caught in the middle as well as this cute little boy totally lost in the filming. You have absolutely no idea who to root for and the end is so ""storybook sweet"" that you just plain don't care.I'd skip this one if I were you.

132676,A1EI65WJC85U68,0792166736,"BD Ashley ""vidiot_y2k""","[2, 3]","Amber (Madonna) is a single woman in her late 30s whose biological clock is ticking, but she is unable to find the right man to father her child. Her ex has just dumped her so her loneliness leads her to seek comfort in the arms of her best friend Robert (Rupert Everett) who happens to be gay. But one 4th of July the drunken pair have a one night stand. Just one of those stupid spur of the moment things; not unlike shampooing your hair with methylated spirits and drying it off with a blowtorch. Life is strange. Well, Madge ends up preggers and wants to keep the baby. But soon she falls in love with Benjamin Bratt...The unconventional family angle present here will raise the ire of many a United Future MP (which in my opinion is always a good thing), but really that's the only positive comment I can make about this drivel. THE NEXT BEST THING is by turns unconvincing, pompous and soapy. How could John ""Midnight Cowboy"" Schlesinger of all people, make a movie like this?However, there are a few unintentional laughs scattered here and there. Early on Madonna screams at her ex, just before he leaves her: ""What you want is a bimbo! And that's exactly what you deserve!"". Dramatic irony? Speaking of dramatics, Madonna's acting is still awful (her accent is fluctuating between Brit and Yank), but she's still quite attractive here. Obviously the lighting tech on this film was really deserving of his paycheck. The movie gets 2 stars simply because it's still far superior to Madonna's most recent cinematic regurgitation, SWEPT AWAY.

She goes to her best friend, Robert (played by Rupert Everett) for a way to get over this. One night, the two become lovers. Abbie then finds out that she's pregnant, and Robert is the father. But Robert is also... gay. Seven years later, while getting ready to do a yoga class, Abbie meets Ben, a charming guy who is very interested in Abbie. The two begin dating. Ben decides that he wants to marry Abbie and it makes Robert furious because he does not want anyone taking his place as Sam's father.If any one of you took the advice from the one's who said that this movie sucked, give that advice back.

132678,A1NDGQH0D61NYB,0792166736,chicago mom,"[5, 8]","I had heard bad reviews about this movie.  However, I tossed them aside as I seem to generally enjoy movies that get panned by critics.  I don't necessarily think a movie always should be &quot;deep&quot;, if it's entertaining, then that's enough for me. So I went into this with an open mind.  For once, I think I should have listened to the critics.  This movie was just awful.  About ten minutes into watching it, my husband and I debated turning it off, but the frugal side of us won over.I am a Madonna fan.  The only movie I have watched with her has been &quot;Desperately Seeking Susan&quot;, which I don't think was much of a stretch for her.  In &quot;The Next Best Thing&quot;, she comes across very stiff and uncomfortable to the camera.  She even looks well past her 40 years of age due to harsh light.  But that's beside the point.  The point is she was not comfortable in this role and it shows.  It seems as though she was dubbed as lot as well.  And the fake English accent was horrendous.  My husband and I agreed that she was awful in the beginning and end, however, she seemed to relax in the middle.  Maybe they shot the beginning and ending scenes first?  That might explain it.Rupert Everett is typically charming, yet I still had trouble caring about his character.  His relationship with Madonna seemed forced, not natural.  And his behavior at the end, although some people may find it justified, made me dislike his character even more.  Benjamin Bratt seemed to be the only natural actor in this movie - too bad he couldn't save it.I cannot fathom that while making this the director, producer, etc. thought that this movie was worthwhile.  Perhaps with another actress it could have been better?  We'll never know.  All I do know is that I never want to watch this movie again.  As my husband so eloquently put, &quot;That's an hour and a half I'll never get back.&quot;",1,Quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen,983750400,"03 5, 2001",2001,1899,"['had', 'heard', 'bad', 'reviews', 'movie', 'However', 'tossed', 'aside', 'seem', 'generally', 'enjoy', 'movies', 'get', 'panned', 'critics', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'think', 'movie', 'always', 'should', 'be', 'quot', 'deep', 'quot', 'entertaining', 'then', 'enough', 'So', 'went', 'open', 'mind', 'once', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'listened', 'critics', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'awful', 'ten', 'minutes', 'watching', 'husband', 'debated', 'turning', 'off', 'frugal', 'side', 'won', 'am', 'Madonna', 'fan', 'only', 'movie', 'have', 'watched', 'been', 'quot', 'Desperately', 'Seeking', 'Susan', 'quot', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'much', 'stretch', 'quot', 'Next', 'Best', 'Thing', 'quot', 'very', 'stiff', 'uncomfortable', 'camera', 'even', 'well', '40', 'years', 'age', 'due', 'harsh', 'light', 'beside', 'point', 'point', 'was', 'not', 'comfortable', 'role', 'was', 'dubbed', 'as', 'lot', 'well', 'fake', 'English', 'accent', 'was', 'horrendous', 'husband', 'agreed', 'was', 'awful', 'beginning', 'end', 'however', 'seemed', 'relax', 'middle', 'Maybe', 'shot', 'beginning', 'ending', 'scenes', 'first', 'might', 'explain', 'it.Rupert', 'Everett', 'typically', 'charming', 'yet', 'still', 'had', 'trouble', 'caring', 'character', 'relationship', 'Madonna', 'seemed', 'forced', 'not', 'natural', 'behavior', 'end', 'people', 'may', 'find', 'justified', 'made', 'dislike', 'character', 'even', 'more', 'Benjamin', 'Bratt', 'seemed', 'be', 'only', 'natural', 'actor', 'movie', 'too', 'bad', 'could', ""n't"", 'save', 'it.I', 'can', 'not', 'fathom', 'making', 'director', 'producer', 'etc', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'worthwhile', 'Perhaps', 'actress', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', ""'ll"", 'never', 'know', 'do', 'know', 'never', 'want', 'watch', 'movie', 'again', 'husband', 'so', 'eloquently', 'put', 'quot', 'hour', 'half', ""'ll"", 'never', 'get', 'back.', 'quot']",The Next Best Thing

The courtroom scenes are particularly well done.Now for the $50000 question - how does Madonna perform??? In my opinion exceptionally well. She has really matured as an actress during her 20+year career.

132681,A2198FZZMTJ38H,0792166736,D. Litton,"[0, 0]","The story and promotional material of &quot;The Next Best Thing&quot; raises many expectations... so many, in fact, that it ruins a good portion of what is supposed to be a heartfelt film of acceptance and the struggle between best friends. The story is somewhat faulty, but the real damper in this film is the acting, which seems flat and lifeless, adding no emotion or heart to a movie that centers around those key feelings. Another ruinous aspect is the lifestyle in which the characters reside, which is much to exorbitant and mismatched for their jobs....  Robert, a homosexual construction worker who is tired of all the sex and &quot;body obsession&quot; that comes along with his lifestyle. Now tell me something: does it not seem a little hypocritical that he complains about body obsession, yet his physique is shown in its glorious form more that its fair share throughout the movie? That's not the end of it; he is best friends with a woman named Abbie, who is a yoga instructor and runs her own classes. This role is played out by Madonna, who seems to be having a lot of trouble in deciding which of her many fake accents to use throughout the film. She never reaches the mark of mediocre acting, much less fine acting, and instead comes across as sounding consigned and drab, adding no life to her character. Even when she cries, you know she's really pushing for tears.The story somewhat picks up when Abbie, upset over her recent breakup with her two-year boyfriend Kevin, and sensible Robert have one too many drinks on the night of the Fourth of July and end up making love, or having sex (we never really know how it turns out; the screen fades black). They wake the next morning, and immediately have an argument about who put the moves on who first the previous evening. This is a waste of scene, especially in the dialogue, where the wit and witticism of Everett is totally wasted of Madonna's unenthused retorts. They go on a hiatus from seeing one another, until Robert makes the ultimate sacrifice of calling her and sending her a plant (original, yet dull).Could the plant be symbolic of events to come? Not even close. If we haven't seen at least one metaphorical meaning yet, we're likely never to encounter one down the road. Abbie discovers that she is pregnant, but never stops to think for one second that the baby is not Robert's (ah, how easy we forget two years of sex). They both agree to give the child a happy and loving home, which will require living together. After Abbie has the baby (which uses one of the most over-used childbirth one-liners ever), the movie skips ahead seven years to the present, even though it seems like we've been in one place the whole time. We see the happy family together among friends, but be forewarned: this is the only real time they ever spend any time together. After this point, the movie spirals into a shameful third act of Robert's jealousy over Abbie's new relationship, and a custody battle that goes nowhere in terms of plot development.What makes this movie work? Nothing, if you sit down and think about it. The movie is supposed to be about family, and the values of a family that is different from you average family. How are we supposed to see how they get along in one house if the only time we get for that is in between the arguments of the adults and the beginning of the second half? Instead, we are left with nothing but a cavalcade of Abbie's relentless whining about the absence of love from her life, Robert's ongoing will to hold onto a child that is not even his own, and occasional intervals that involve a lifeless Neil Patrick Harris as Robert's friend and confidante. He does nothing for the film on any level; he is just simply thrown into the mix, along with such actors as Lynn Redgrave and Benjamin Bratt, whom we never really get to know.There always seems to be a glimmer of hope on the horizon for this movie, and just when it seems like something good is going to happen, it becomes hampered by plot twists and crappy dialogue that add nothing but running time to the movie. The third act, or the courtroom battle, is the most ludicrous of these twists. The whole premise of the movie is supposed to be about best friends working things out together. So why drag us through an entire courtroom sequence that does nothing but make us lose more feeling for the characters?The acting is some of the most flat and dull performances I've seen in a movie in a long time. It makes no sense that Madonna is placed in such a role; this is a huge step down from her character in &quot;Evita,&quot; and she plays out Abbie as if she knows this is true. She is never really able to show any true emotion, and while she looks like she is right at home with the role, it makes the rest of the movie suffer and dwindle. Rupert Everett is sometimes emotional and enlightening as Robert, though his wit and humor, while adding a small degree of charm, do virtually nothing to salvage it. Supporting actors are hardly worth mentioning more than they already have been, because we never really get a chance to know them, therefore, we cannot care for them at all.Through the marketing criteria, the movie is made to seem like something so much more than it really is. But, although it looks good on the outside, &quot;The Next Best Thing&quot; is a grab bag of leftover plotlines and flimsy dialogue all thrown together to create something that really doesn't have as great an impact as it aspires to have.",2,"Misses the mark, emotionally and outwardly.",983577600,"03 3, 2001",2001,5500,"['story', 'promotional', 'material', 'quot', 'Next', 'Best', 'Thing', 'quot',

At best this is a mediocre film, a fairly ineffective mix of comedy, drama, and romance.  Despite being friends in real life, Madonna and Rupert Everett have little chemistry (Everett was a much more appealing gay gal pal to Julia Roberts in &quot;My Best Friend's Wedding&quot;).  We know these actors (along with Benjamin Bratt) can do better and perhaps it is the script that is to blame. Towards the end of the movie there is a sudden plot twist -- if the viewing audience was clued into this earlier it would have created more tension until it was eventually unveiled. While it is a betrayal to one of the characters it is likewise one to viewers.  Without giving anything away, the turn of events is based on something that should have been common knowledge to any informed/involved parent (which the movie professes both parties are).  Additionally, there are the usual (and admittedly nit-picky) film head-scratchers like how could a yoga instructor possibly afford a beautiful home like that in LA area?The extras on this DVD are fairly negligible.  There are extended interviews with the cast and director (Madonna seems a bit on guard) and Madonna's video for &quot;American Pie&quot; (Interesting cover version or musical blasphemy?  You make the call!).

I did find some admirable things about it, which I'll end the review to put it on a positive note.  But it also has a bunch of problems which makes one think that Hollywood's idea of the world earns them the title of ""La-La-Land"".The story involves a pair of best friends, a gay male and hetero female,  who have a drunken liason one night that produces a child.  What I thought was going to be a comedy (as it was billed) about the adventures that this causes turns out to be a much more serious movie about other things, some good, some bad.First, we have a gardener and a yoga instructor pooling incomes.  Sorry folks, these jobs don't pay a lot.  While not living extravagantly, they still seem to have a lifestyle that goes way beyond their realistic incomes.  This is just the first of many ways the movie is interested in portraying eye candy more than telling an even remotely realistic story.Continuing on the eye-candy role was the complete avoidance of hard-times that come with evey new baby.  Since they chose to take a very serious tone in the movie, they could have shown Madonna dragging her butt out of bed at 3 a.m. to answer a cry, or hunky Everett cleaning up a big mess.  But we see this apparantly absolutely perfect baby's first years bypassed to produced an apparantly absolutely perfect child.  In this world, you can't be bad-looking or out of shape.So while the movie falls apart with no connection to reality whatsoever, I did find some things that salvaged a bit of it.  When I still thought this was going to be a comedy, I was prepared to see a bunch of situations where certain cast members would not know the whole story, and there would be scenes to cover-up the situation.  It was refreshing to see that the whole story was explained to each character as they entered the picture.  The way all the characters acted here did give it a bit of intelligence, and it was refreshing to not see his parents freak out.  I also liked that the movie averted negative gay stereotypes, but when the movie ended, and I heard one of my kids crying, it was nice to get back to reality.",2,"Not that horrible, but still...",1019433600,"04 22, 2002",2002,2225,"['put', 'off', 'seeing', 'long', 'time', 'due', 'extremely', 'bad', 'reviews', 'got', 'cornered', 'seeing', 'other', 'day', 'did', 'find', 'admirable', 'things', ""'ll"", 'end', 'review', 'put', 'positive', 'note', 'also', 'bunch', 'problems', 'one', 'think', 'Hollywood', 'idea', 'world', 'title', 'La-La-Land', '.The', 'story', 'pair', 'best', 'friends', 'gay', 'male', 'hetero', 'female', 'who', 'have', 'drunken', 'liason', 'one', 'night', 'child', 'What', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'comedy', 'was', 'billed', 'adventures', 'out', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'serious', 'movie', 'other', 'things', 'good', 'bad.First', 'have', 'gardener', 'yoga', 'instructor', 'pooling', 'incomes', 'Sorry', 'folks', 'jobs', 'do', ""n't"", 'pay', 'lot', 'not', 'living', 'extravagantly', 'still', 'seem', 'have', 'lifestyle', 'way', 'realistic', 'incomes', 'just', 'first', 'many', 'ways', 'movie', 'interested', 'portraying', 'eye', 'candy', 'more', 'telling', 'even', 'remotely', 'realistic', 'story.Continuing', 'eye-candy', 'role', 'was', 'complete', 'avoidance', 'hard-times', 'come', 'evey', 'new', 'baby', 'chose', 'take', 'very', 'serious', 'tone', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'shown', 'Madonna', 'dragging', 'butt', 'bed', '3', 'a.m.', 'answer', 'cry', 'hunky', 'Everett', 'cleaning', 'up', 'big', 'mess', 'see', 'apparantly', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'baby', 'first', 'years', 'bypassed', 'produced', 'apparantly', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'child', 'world', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'bad-looking', 'shape.So', 'movie', 'apart', 'connection', 'reality', 'whatsoever', 'did', 'find', 'things', 'salvaged', 'bit', 'When', 'still', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'comedy', 'was', 'prepared', 'see', 'bunch', 'situations', 'where', 'certain', 'cast', 'members', 'would', 'not', 'know', 'whole', 'story', 'would', 'be', 'scenes', 'cover-up', 'situation', 'was', 'refreshing', 'see', 'whole', 'story', 'was', 'explained', 'character', 'entered', 'picture', 'way', 'characters', 'acted', 'here', 'did', 'give', 'bit', 'intelligence', 'was', 'refreshing', 'not', 'see', 'parents', 'freak', 'also', 'liked', 'movie', 'averted', 'negative', 'gay', 'stereotypes', 'when', 'movie', 'ended', 'heard', 'one', 'kids', 'crying', 'was', 'nice', 'get', 'back', 'reality']",The Next Best Thing

Madonna is without a doubt the worst actress I have ever witnessed. I should not even call her an actress really. She is without a doubt the most unqualified person I have ever seen attempting to act. Her greatest problem, I think, is that she just tries too hard. Either that or she does not try at all. Her characters all seem like caricatured extensions of her public persona. Perhaps she is affected by the fact that she is Madonna. You cannot lose sight of the fact that she is Madonna when you see her in films. Still, from anyone else, the viewing public would not accept this level of crap. The story is about a yoga teacher (Madonna) and her gay best friend. In a night of reckless abandon and heartbreak, she becomes pregnant with what she believes is his child (I think it turns out that the child is not his, but they do not discover this until their friendship sours and he wants to share custody of the child). She eventually meets and falls in love with Benjamin Bratt's character. It is all quite sappy, stupid, juvenile. I have never seen anything so contrived as Madonna's scenes with Bratt.

It brings up a lot of issues, most of which more for me make the 'main point' recede into the background.Approaching this as a social concern issue, at different parts of the film I would have different responses. Certain by the end of the film, as the child had come to recognise Robert as 'dad', it would only do harm to the child to break this relationship. However, the question of whether there is a realistic prospect of even the best of friends living together in such a manner as Abbie and Robert, when both are likely (and in fact in the movie, did, albeit rather perfunctorially until the end) to want to continue to have intimate adult relationships before long, no matter how much they subordinate these desires in consideration of the child. It is a family arrangement almost certainly doomed to failure, particularly given Abbie's history of not being able to achieve a successful, sustained relationship.With regard to the film as itself, Rupert Everett is the saving grace of the film. Madonna is not, I think, as bad as many people think, in this film. She does a good and credible job.  But her character lacked a multi-dimensionality that the script tried to hide by interjecting diversions (the yoga, the unconventional household arrangement, etc. -- these things are intended to give more 'character' to the Madonna's character, or, like a magician's assistant, divert your attention from the fact there's not much substance there). Everett's character is only somewhat more fleshed out, but only in one real direction.The subplots are, alas, unsuccessful -- we don't get enough detail or enough emotion. Who is this person who died at the beginning? Beyond knowing his family didn't like him until he was dead, and knowing that high liturgical funerals are not to his liking, we don't know much. Yet this is, I believe, supposed to be a critical issue in the film--acceptance of varying styles of families, and the problems that arise from their lack of legal standing.I applaud movies like this that try to combat the various forms of prejudice out there. As non-traditional families become more the norm than the exception, a greater understanding of the people in those relationships is very important. I just wish for better vehicles than this, that have more believable characters (and more fully-human characters) and more credible situations.Overall, I enjoyed the film, and I am a sucker for a happy ending. But, is it happy? When will the relationship with Abbie's husband cease to work out? Will Robert as a single father ever form a successful relationship? Are they still doomed to failure? I doubt a sequel will be produced to answer these questions.",4,"Second best, perhaps...",1058832000,"07 22, 2003",2003,2807,"['attempt', 'illustrate', 'modern', 'family', 'configurations', 'Next', 'Best', 'Thing', 'had', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'agenda', 'up', 'lot', 'issues', 'most', 'more', 'make', ""'main"", 'point', 'recede', 'background.Approaching', 'social', 'concern', 'issue', 'different', 'parts', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'different', 'responses', 'Certain', 'end', 'film', 'child', 'had', 'come', 'recognise', 'Robert', ""'dad"", 'would', 'only', 'do', 'harm', 'child', 'break', 'relationship', 'However', 'question', 'realistic', 'prospect', 'even', 'best', 'friends', 'living', 'together', 'such', 'manner', 'Abbie', 'Robert', 'when', 'are', 'likely', 'fact', 'movie', 'did', 'rather', 'perfunctorially', 'end', 'want', 'continue', 'have', 'intimate', 'adult', 'relationships', 'long', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'subordinate', 'desires', 'consideration', 'child', 'family', 'arrangement', 'almost', 'certainly', 'doomed', 'failure', 'particularly', 'given', 'Abbie', 'history', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'achieve', 'successful', 'sustained', 'relationship.With', 'regard', 'film', 'Rupert', 'Everett', 'saving', 'grace', 'film', 'Madonna', 'not', 'think', 'as', 'bad', 'many', 'people', 'think', 'film', 'good', 'credible', 'job', 'character', 'lacked', 'multi-dimensionality', 'script', 'tried', 'hide', 'interjecting', 'diversions', 'yoga', 'unconventional', 'household', 'arrangement', 'etc', 'things', 'are', 'intended', 'give', 'more', ""'character"", 'Madonna', 'character', 'magician', 'assistant', 'divert', 'attention', 'fact', 'not', 'much', 'substance', 'there', 'Everett', 'character', 'only', 'somewhat', 'more', 'fleshed', 'only', 'one', 'real', 'direction.The', 'subplots', 'are', 'alas', 'unsuccessful', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'detail', 'enough', 'emotion', 'Who', 'person', 'who', 'died', 'beginning', 'knowing', 'family', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'was', 'dead', 'knowing', 'high', 'liturgical', 'funerals', 'are', 'not', 'liking', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'believe', 'supposed', 'be', 'critical', 'issue', 'film', 'acceptance', 'varying', 'styles', 'families', 'problems', 'arise', 'lack', 'legal', 'standing.I', 'applaud', 'movies', 'try', 'combat', 'various', 'forms', 'prejudice', 'there', 'non-traditional', 'families', 'become', 'more', 'norm', 'exception', 'greater', 'understanding', 'people', 'relationships', 'very', 'important', 'just', 'wish', 'better', 'vehicles', 'have', 'more', 'believable', 'characters', 'more', 'fully-human', 'characters', 'more', 'credible', 'situations.Overall', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'am', 'sucker', 'happy', 'ending', 'happy', 'When', 'will', 'relationship', 'Abbie', 'husband', 'cease', 'work', 'out', 'Will', 'Robert', 'single', 'father', 'ever', 'successful', 'relationship', 'Are', 'still', 'doomed', 'failure', 'doubt', 'sequel', 'will', 'be', 'produced', 'answer', 'questions']",The Next Best Thing

It was the first time I'd seen a movie where Michael Vartan's character actually made me so mad.  (He did an awesome job, though.)Basically, you have Abbie (Madonna) and Robert (Everett), who would be the perfect couple except that Robert is gay, so they're just the best of friends.  One Independence Day, Abbie and Robert decide to get drunk (very drunk) to kind of shed their previous relationship and life problems.  While drunk, they have sex.  Later, Abbie learns that she is pregnant and tells Robert (who is still upset over actually having sex with a woman) that she's pregnant with his child.  Robert moves in with Abbie, and they're still living in the same house after almost six years.That's when, after Robert encourages her to date, Abbie meets and falls in love with Ben (Benjamin Bratt).  This complicates everything and the satirical comedy takes a very dramatic edge, but in the end, everything will be alright.I would definitely recommend this movie.

Abbie (Madonna), a straight yoga instructor, and Robert (Rupert Everett), a gay landscaper, are best friends and, more importantly, chosen family. They've been through a lot together, so when they have drunken sex one night and Abbie ends up pregnant, they decide to move in together and raise the child together in their own little unconventional family. Neither of them counts on Abbie meeting someone and falling in love. When it happens, things take a nasty turn that ends in the courtroom.As much as I love Madonna, there's a reason why most of her movies flop. With the exception of Evita, she seems to have very bad taste in movie scripts. This one is slightly better than some of her other choices, but it's really not all that special and it can't seem to decide what it wants to be, romantic comedy or serious family drama.

132696,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,0792166736,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[1, 2]","With all the star power behind this movie, it should have been executed skillfully; pulling the viewer into the lives of nice people, exploring the novel living arrangements and lifestyles of the main characters, even highlighting what should have been a key, dramatic moment in the movie. Instead, the movie drags on for nearly an hour before we have an inkling of what this movie is really about.  As it drags itself forcefully along we have great difficulty identifying with the characters or their plight.Abbie Reynolds (Madonna) is a woman who hears her biological clock ticking. She wants to meet a nice guy and have one or more children. Failing meeting Mr. Right, she would at least like to have a child. After breaking up with yet another boyfriend, Madonna commiserates with a homosexual friend, Robert Whittaker (Ruppert Everett), and the two end up (good heavens!) doing something sexual together. Soon after, Madonna reveals she is pregnant. Robert decides he wants to be fully involved as Sam's (Malcolm Stumpf) father.Well, time flies and Ben Cooper, excellently played by Benjamin Bratt, enters the picture, quickly falling in love with Abbie. Ben behaves just as we would like or hope he would, and adjusts his life to suit Abbie, Robert and Sam's as much, if not more, than is reasonable. Unfortunately for poor Sam, the relatively immature conflict between Abbie and Sam washes aside all Ben's good deeds and flexibility and a nasty court battle ensues. I'll not give away the ending or any other details in the event you wish to try the movie yourself.In addition to the star horsepower already mentioned, Lynn Redgrave, Neil Patrick Harris, and Joseph Sommer, all with extensive acting credentials, appear. The director and producer add even more horsepower. The problem is that all this horsepower failed to help me understand the plot, or empathize with the characters. This movie presented a wonderful opportunity to help explore having a homosexual as a parent, and deal more in depth with the issues of homosexuality and stereotypes surrounding homosexuality. Instead, the movie usually pays only brief lip service to those issues.  In some cases the movie opens the door to the issue, and then sweeps it under the rug. In one example, Sam asks Robert about a inappropriate word he heard associated with homosexuals, and what the word meant. Instead of dealing with the issue, the answer was more akin to ""babies come from the cabbage patch."" If the movie did not want to deal with sensitive issues, it should not have brought them up in the first place.After forcing myself to watch this movie for an hour or more in the hope that it would really take off and make a statement, it devolved into legal bickering between Abbie and Robert with all sorts of uninteresting confusion thrown in by Ben and an old boyfriend of Abbie's. Instead of a grand statement regarding homosexuals as parents, the movie became just another couple bickering over child custody and I became extremely disappointed with the plot development.Even in the final moments of the movie, the opportunity to do more than have a trite and cliche ending was passed by. There is little more I can say about the ending.The movie is not a total loss. Benjamin Bratt and Malcolm Stumpf have good chemistry during their interactions with others in the movie. Had Benjamin and Malcolm been absent, this movie would have been a total loss. As it is, I rate this movie three stars largely on the performance of these two actors and what they brought to the movie.",3,Hard to Empathize with the Characters (Region 2 DVD),1156896000,"08 30, 2006",2006,3550,"['star', 'power', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'executed', 'skillfully', 'pulling', 'viewer', 'lives', 'nice', 'people', 'exploring', 'novel', 'living', 'arrangements', 'lifestyles', 'main', 'characters', 'even', 'highlighting', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'key', 'dramatic', 'moment', 'movie', 'Instead', 'movie', 'nearly', 'hour', 'have', 'inkling', 'what', 'movie', 'really', 'about', 'forcefully', 'have', 'great', 'difficulty', 'identifying', 'characters', 'plight.Abbie', 'Reynolds', 'Madonna', 'woman', 'who', 'biological', 'clock', 'ticking', 'meet', 'nice', 'guy', 'have', 'one', 'more', 'children', 'Failing', 'meeting', 'Mr', 'Right', 'would', 'least', 'have', 'child', 'breaking', 'up', 'yet', 'boyfriend', 'Madonna', 'homosexual', 'friend', 'Robert', 'Whittaker', 'Ruppert', 'Everett', 'two', 'end', 'up', 'good', 'heavens', 'doing', 'something', 'sexual', 'together', 'Soon', 'Madonna', 'pregnant', 'Robert', 'be', 'fully', 'involved', 'Sam', 'Malcolm', 'Stumpf', 'father.Well', 'time', 'flies', 'Ben', 'Cooper', 'excellently', 'played', 'Benjamin', 'Bratt', 'picture', 'quickly', 'falling', 'love', 'Abbie', 'Ben', 'just', 'would', 'like', 'hope', 'would', 'life', 'suit', 'Abbie', 'Robert', 'Sam', 'as', 'much', 'not', 'more', 'reasonable', 'Unfortunately', 'poor', 'Sam', 'relatively', 'immature', 'conflict', 'Abbie', 'Sam', 'washes', 'aside', 'Ben', 'good', 'deeds', 'flexibility', 'nasty', 'court', 'battle', ""'ll"", 'not', 'give', 'away', 'ending', 'other', 'details', 'event', 'wish', 'try', 'movie', 'yourself.In', 'addition', 'star', 'horsepower', 'already', 'mentioned', 'Lynn', 'Redgrave', 'Neil', 'Patrick', 'Harris', 'Joseph', 'Sommer', 'extensive', 'acting', 'credentials', 'appear', 'director', 'producer', 'add', 'even', 'more', 'horsepower', 'problem', 'horsepower', 'failed', 'help', 'understand', 'plot', 'empathize', 'characters', 'movie', 'presented', 'wonderful', 'opportunity', 'help', 'explore', 'having', 'homosexual', 'parent', 'deal', 'more', 'depth', 'issues', 'homosexuality', 'stereotypes', 'surrounding', 'homosexuality', 'Instead', 'movie', 'usually', 'only', 'brief', 'lip', 'service', 'issues', 'cases', 'movie', 'door', 'issue', 'then', 'sweeps', 'rug', 'one', 'example', 'Sam', 'Robert', 'inappropriate', 'word', 'heard', 'associated', 'homosexuals', 'what', 'word', 'meant', 'Instead', 'dealing', 'issue', 'answer', 'was', 'more', 'akin', 'babies', 'come', 'cabbage', 'patch', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'deal', 'sensitive', 'issues', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'brought', 'up', 'first', 'place.After', 'forcing', 'watch', 'movie', 'hour', 'more', 'hope', 'would', 'really', 'take', 'off', 'make', 'statement', 'devolved', 'legal', 'bickering', 'Abbie', 'Robert', 'sorts', 'uninteresting', 'confusion', 'thrown', 'Ben', 'old', 'boyfriend', 'Abbie', 'Instead', 'grand', 'statement', 'regarding', 'homosexuals', 'parents', 'movie', 'became', 'just', 'couple', 'bickering', 'child', 'custody', 'became', 'extremely', 'disappointed', 'plot', 'development.Even', 'final', 'moments', 'movie', 'opportunity', 'do', 'more', 'have', 'trite', 'cliche', 'ending', 'was', 'passed', 'little', 'more', 'can', 'say', 'ending.The', 'movie', 'not', 'total', 'loss', 'Benjamin', 'Bratt', 'Malcolm', 'Stumpf', 'have', 'good', 'chemistry', 'interactions', 'others', 'movie', 'Had', 'Benjamin', 'Malcolm', 'been', 'absent', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'total', 'loss', 'rate', 'movie', 'three', 'stars', 'largely', 'performance', 'two', 'actors', 'what', 'brought', 'movie']",The Next Best Thing

While it does have some amusing scenes [none of them hilariously funny], the entire second half is melodrama on the order of a TV soap opera, only not nearly as clever.Madonna plays Abbie, a hip Los Angeles woman of about forty who says she never married because she never found the right guy. When her live-in boyfriend walks out on her, she runs to her best friend, Robert [Rupert Everett], a handsome gay man who has decided that he may never have another serious relationship. He tells her she is better off without the guy, which is true, yet she pines, not so much for the old flame, as for the fact that she may never have a family of her own. Robert lives in the guest house of a swank Hollywood Hills home belonging to two old queens, who would have had the movies best lines if it had had any. Left alone at the house one 4th of July, Robert and Abbie drown their sorrows in margaritas and wind up in bed together. A few weeks later, Abbie announces she is pregnant with Robert's child. Robert decides that he will move in with her and be a real Dad to the child, although he thinks marriage would be hypocritical. After all, satisfying each other has certain limits. All this works out for six years, until Abbie meets Ben [Benjamin Bratt], and they fall in love.This is a perfect plot for a satirical comedy about love, lust, puritanical inhibitions and other such nonsense. Instead, the movie does an about face and becomes serious. The characters get mad, angry and downright ugly. Then, as if the producers saw the damage they'd done, there is a trite 'feel good' ending, which looks tacked on.Madonna and Everett do the best they can with the material. I can't really gauge Madonna's acting ability. She was superb in Evita and a few other movies, but I suspect that she hasn't the discipline to throw her full talents into anything she doesn't believe in one hundred percent. I know Everett is a fine actor, but here there is little he can do except reprise his character from My Best Friend's Wedding. In real life, the two stars are good friends, and I can only imagine all the knowing glances exchanged between them during production.It is frankly a bit shocking that John Schlesinger directed the film. Thirty years ago he directed two movies, Midnight Cowboy and Sunday, Bloody Sunday, which expertly examined the nuances and subtleties of human sexuality. He's at a total loss here. I suspect most of the audience will be, too.",1,"Retro, timid, limp.

For this movie, Madonna did her own version of American Pie, with Rupert Everett appearing in the video, and also doing backing vocals.The Next Best Thing teamed up Madonna & Rupert, the latter playing the exact same role he played in My Best Friend's Wedding, just more toned down. Yes, I know, Madonna is never going to be a terrific, despite her frequent attempts, but she's bearable at least. Although her accent is very dodgy in this, it's like she can't decide what the Atlantic she wants to be from.The storyline is basically, Abbie (Madonna) is a yoga instructor, who is desperately broody. Her boyfriend, Kevin (played by Michael Vartan), is a commitment-phobe, and moves out. After a drunken night out with her gay best friend, Robert (played by Rupert), she discovers she's pregnant.That's pretty much the storyline, the rest is really predictable. When the son turns 6, Abbie meets a new man, Benjamin Bratt, and wants to get married to him. Robert flips out, demands custody, only to discover that the son he adored isn't his. Shock horror, court case.Pretty predictable. Rupert is brilliant, although not as OTT as he was in My Best Friend's Wedding, but it's his film. Never mind some woman who sometimes sings. Who cares? Rupert is perfect in this kinda role.There are no extras on this DVD. Not a trailer, not even the video to American Pie. What a shame. Thankfully, it was only cheap. Not memorable.

132703,A1HCHMYMPO97CL,0792166736,M. J. Dirou,"[2, 5]","She keeps on trying doesn't she, our Mads, like the trooper she is. No matter how many times the critics trash her. Honestly, this movie had a lot of potential, with an interesting story line that tackled a kind of a modern day re-definition of family units and the moral dilemmas and choices involved. With its very worthy supporting cast it could have really gone somewhere but just failed to get there.Madonna god bless you, I truly wish you could read this because I have two bits of stern advice which I'm sure many others would agree with, to help your (flailing) acting career, if it's not too late. Firstly, get some major voice coaching! Your delivery of dialogue is so unbelievably stilted and wooden at times. It's like you've just learnt the script. And what is up with this phoney pseudo half British half American accent you put on? Was that supposed to be part of your character development or research?. Even though her gay best friend 'Robert' is British, the audience would assume 'Abbie' is just an American living in LA. Besides which, it just  sounded so fake. I mean we know you've become a bit of an 'Anglo-Phile' now that you're married to a pom (Australian slang for 'English person'), but you don't have to make it part of every character you play now do you? Concentrate on your acting craft before you start with the specialty accents luv. Meryl streep you aint. Secondly, if you want us to believe in Madonna the actress you've got to leave out Madonna the pop star just for a moment, and quit with the mindless marketing of your pop image, just for the sake of selling more records. My god woman, why does nearly everyone of your movies have to feature your music in the soundtrack somewhere? That scene early on in the film, where you all sing American Pie, at the gay friend's lover's funeral, was just sooo embarrassingly contrived and unnecessary. And quite frankly, fond as I am mostly of your music, your recorded version of 'American Pie' was very weak. Just lifeless.I know I am being a bit harsh but someone really needs to tell you these things, or rather you really need to hear them,'cause I have actually been a fan of yours from the beginning. Despite your money hungry commercialism, you're an amazing artist and woman in so many ways. I see the potential in your performances often and you have an incredible presence on stage and screen that cannot be denied. But when it comes to the craft of acting a lot more subtlety and discipline is required and you need to learn a bit of humility darling, come down to earth.Now, as for the redeeming features of this movie, and there are some. I would love Rupert Everett in anything he does. He's so cleverly sardonic and witty in that classy British way. Unfortunately though he is sold rather short here due to a poor script and mediocre direction, but I still enjoyed his performance. I must say I did feel awfully sorry for Robert near the end. He must have felt, intentionally or not, tricked and used by Abbie in a way. I mean she really should have taken responsibilty to ensure who the father was initially, don't you think?. Benjamin Bratt is most easy on the eye and a welcome hetero-sexual addition. Also, I loved the colourful 'Sante Fe' style design and setting. As well as Madonna 'hippyish yoga teacher' chic, (though the yoga thing is also somewhat contrived, no doubt Madonna's influence?) Lastly, there are moments (yes some) when Madonna's acting and character are believable. I always find her the most convincing in her character's more casual, fun moments. Which makes me think she is better suited to lighter comedic roles like earlier on in her career. The kid who plays Sam is quite natural and cute. In reality though that poor child would be left feeling so torn and confused after all that had occurred. He's faced with the prospect of three fathers (or at least father roles) in his life. Overall I quite enjoyed the first part, but really lost interest when the 'same old, same old' court room battle scene came around.

But if you choose to see it open-minded, you might just get to like this mess.""The Next Best Thing"" initially sets itself up as a comedy. Robert (played by Rupert Everett) is always there for his best friend Abbie (Madonna), especially when it comes to comfort her over her terrible taste in men. And since he's also keen on men, he gives her a few pointers along the way. However, after a few drinks (and an unbelievably entertaining Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers act), Abbie gets pregnant. The viewer is then quite surprised when the whole thing turns serious and chaotic as Robert and Abbie decide to live and raise the baby together, and then struggle with problems concerning their family, friends and Abbie's new sweetheart (Benjamin Brett).Now, the good thing about this film are its stars. Although it's hard to believe that it's taken them 30 minutes of the film to sleep together and that Madonna can't find a man in L.A., they are irresistible. Everett is top-notch as always and Madge has rarely seemed as much at home with a part as she does in this film. They are able to pull off the comedic parts and are good enough when the film surprisingly evolves into a study of family life.However, the second half of the film doesn't really work.

132711,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,0792166736,Roland E. Zwick,"[5, 5]","Forget about diamonds. `The Next Best Thing' is dedicated to the proposition that a gay man is really a girl's best friend. But, man, can that make life complicated! Madonna stars as Abbie, a Southern California yoga instructor who just can't seem to find that certain someone to provide her with marriage and a child but who, at the same time, hears her biological clock ticking ominously down. Rupert Everett plays Robert, her gay best friend, whom Abbie leans upon for support in times of grave romantic crisis - which seems to be just about her normal state of affairs. One night the two get a little too drunk and frisky and end up consummating their friendship, an act that leads to Abbie's pregnancy and a decision between the two to move in together and raise the child as mother and father but not husband and wife. All goes fairly well for six years or so until Abbie falls in love with a young New York executive who wants to marry her and move the three of them away from Los Angeles and the man Sammy thinks of as his father. This leads to a complex court battle between the principals as the suddenly antagonistic best friends struggle over custody of their child.In this day and age when less traditional relationships and families abound in our society, credit `The Next Best Thing' with at least trying to come to terms with some of the unintended and unforeseen consequences that result when well-meaning people wind up in overly complicated situations. We see that Abbie obviously has strong feelings for this man she knows she can never have, while Robert feels inexplicable stirrings of jealousy when Abbie begins to develop an interest in her new beau. We also see the difficulties faced by little Sammy as he begins to grow up and be questioned by his little friends about the unconventional relationship of his parents. (However, this interesting theme is dealt with in only the most superficial way before it is conveniently swept under the carpet). As the film examines the setup from its many different angles and perspectives, it attempts to deal fairly with the principal characters involved. No one is made out to be the heavy or the villain, yet, at the same time; all the characters have their moments of unreasonable selfishness. The main problem with `The Next Best Thing,' however, is that it is attempting to address these really serious issues in the context of a lighthearted romantic comedy. As a result, the plotting seems somehow more contrived than it might if it were developed along the lines of a serious social drama. We never really believe any of it, partly because the film seems to spend more of its time displaying and lingering over the truly phenomenal bodies of its three main actors than exploring the depth of their characters. It all seems so surface slick, replete with a too-cozy happy ending done in summary written codas flashed on the screen immediately prior to the closing credits.Madonna and Everett are both physically very attractive performers - a real boon to the 40+ actors set that doesn't seem to get too much work in the movie romance department these days. As an actress, Madonna has certainly come a long way from her truly wretched performances in the early part of her film career. In this film, except when she is called upon to cry - in which case, she is still incredibly unconvincing - she does seem to have a more relaxed presence on the screen than she has had previously. Everett looks as though he would much rather be sinking his teeth into a far meatier role, but, given the material he has to work with, he does a serviceable job. Oddly enough, this film contains a host of secondary characters who pop up so infrequently or disappear entirely with no explanation that one wonders either why they were included in the first place or at what stage between scriptwriting and final editing they lost their way. This sloppiness and the overall timidity and slickness of the film are particularly surprising given the fact that director John Schlesinger was once responsible for such classic edgy works as &quot;Darling&quot; and &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; in the 1960's.`The Next Best Thing' has its heart in the right place and its twisting/turning plot structure, built on the complex emotional needs of its character, carries the audience along fairly nicely. We can identify with these people because, although they seem well meaning, they are also way over their heads with the cards life has dealt them. Who among us cannot empathize with that situation? A pity, then, that `The Next Best Thing' didn't provide a bit more serious context in which to explore it.",3,not bad but could have been better,972777600,"10 29, 2000",2000,4652,"['Forget', 'diamonds', 'Next', 'Best', 'Thing', 'dedicated', 'proposition', 'gay', 'man', 'really', 'girl', 'best', 'friend', 'man', 'can', 'make', 'life', 'complicated', 'Madonna', 'Abbie', 'Southern', 'California', 'yoga', 'instructor', 'who', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'find', 'certain', 'someone', 'provide', 'marriage', 'child', 'who', 'same', 'time', 'biological', 'clock', 'ticking', 'ominously', 'down', 'Rupert', 'Everett', 'Robert', 'gay', 'best', 'friend', 'whom', 'Abbie', 'support', 'times', 'grave', 'romantic', 'crisis', 'be', 'just', 'normal', 'state', 'affairs', 'One', 'night', 'two', 'get', 'little', 'too', 'drunk', 'frisky', 'end', 'up', 'consummating', 'friendship', 'act', 'Abbie', 'pregnancy', 'decision', 'two', 'move', 'together', 'raise', 'child', 'mother', 'father', 'not', 'husband', 'wife', 'fairly', 'well', 'six', 'years', 'so', 'Abbie', 'love', 'young', 'New', 'York', 'executive', 'who', 'marry', 'move', 'three', 'away', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'man', 'Sammy', 'father', 'complex', 'court', 'battle', 'principals', 'suddenly', 'antagonistic', 'best', 'friends', 'struggle', 'custody', 'child.In', 'day', 'age', 'when', 'less', 'traditional', 'relationships', 'families', 'abound', 'society', 'credit', 'Next', 'Best', 'Thing', 'least', 'trying', 'come', 'terms', 'unintended', 'unforeseen', 'consequences', 'result', 'when', 'well-meaning', 'people', 'wind', 'up', 'overly', 'complicated', 'situations', 'see', 'Abbie', 'obviously', 'strong', 'feelings', 'man', 'can', 'never', 'have', 'Robert', 'feels', 'inexplicable', 'stirrings', 'jealousy', 'when', 'Abbie', 'develop', 'interest', 'new', 'beau', 'also', 'see', 'difficulties', 'faced', 'little', 'Sammy', 'grow', 'up', 'be', 'questioned', 'little', 'friends', 'unconventional', 'relationship', 'parents', 'However', 'interesting', 'theme', 'dealt', 'only', 'most', 'superficial', 'way', 'conveniently', 'swept', 'carpet', 'film', 'setup', 'many', 'different', 'angles', 'perspectives', 'deal', 'fairly', 'principal', 'characters', 'involved', 'one', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'heavy', 'villain', 'yet', 'same', 'time', 'characters', 'have', 'moments', 'unreasonable', 'selfishness', 'main', 'problem', 'Next', 'Best', 'Thing', 'however', 'attempting', 'address', 'really', 'serious', 'issues', 'context', 'lighthearted', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'result', 'plotting', 'somehow', 'more', 'contrived', 'might', 'were', 'developed', 'lines', 'serious', 'social', 'drama', 'never', 'really', 'believe', 'partly', 'film', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'displaying', 'lingering', 'truly', 'phenomenal', 'bodies', 'three', 'main', 'actors', 'exploring', 'depth', 'characters', 'so', 'surface', 'slick', 'replete', 'too-cozy', 'happy', 'ending', 'done', 'summary', 'written', 'codas', 'flashed', 'screen', 'immediately', 'prior', 'closing', 'credits.Madonna', 'Everett', 'are', 'physically', 'very', 'attractive', 'performers', 'real', 'boon', '40+', 'actors', 'set', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'too', 'much', 'work', 'movie', 'romance', 'department', 'days', 'actress', 'Madonna', 'certainly', 'come', 'long', 'way', 'truly', 'wretched', 'performances', 'early', 'part', 'film', 'career', 'film', 'when', 'called', 'cry', 'case', 'still', 'incredibly', 'unconvincing', 'seem', 'have', 'more', 'relaxed', 'presence', 'screen', 'had', 'previously', 'Everett', 'would', 'much', 'rather', 'be', 'sinking', 'teeth', 'far', 'meatier', 'role', 'given', 'material', 'work', 'serviceable', 'job', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'film', 'host', 'secondary', 'characters', 'who', 'pop', 'up', 'so', 'infrequently', 'disappear', 'entirely', 'explanation', 'one', 'wonders', 'why', 'were', 'included', 'first', 'place', 'what', 'stage', 'scriptwriting', 'final', 'editing', 'lost', 'way', 'sloppiness', 'overall', 'timidity', 'slickness', 'film', 'are', 'particularly', 'surprising', 'given', 'fact', 'director', 'John', 'Schlesinger', 'was', 'once', 'responsible', 'such', 'classic', 'edgy', 'quot', 'Darling', 'quot', 'quot', 'Midnight', 'Cowboy', 'quot', ""1960's."", 'Next', 'Best', 'Thing', 'heart', 'right', 'place', 'twisting/turning', 'plot', 'structure', 'built', 'complex', 'emotional', 'needs', 'character', 'audience', 'fairly', 'nicely', 'can', 'identify', 'people', 'because', 'seem', 'well', 'meaning', 'are', 'also', 'way', 'heads', 'cards', 'life', 'dealt', 'Who', 'can', 'not', 'empathize', 'situation', 'pity', 'then', 'Next', 'Best', 'Thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'provide', 'bit', 'more', 'serious', 'context', 'explore']",The Next Best Thing

I could go on for hours about how bad this movie is, however, due to my own lack of patience, I'll limit it to just a couple of the most irritating issues.1.

Rupet Everett is a very talented actor, and you can tell that he is very clearly the ONLY member of the cast that has even just the ability to inject any life into these hollow shells of characters.3.

NOBODY'S BUYING IT!!!!!!!!!5.  The movie was unforgivably long.6.  The pace of the script was terrible.  It was almost as if the director had actually lost track of time, realized the movie was running long, tried to wrap everything up too quick.  The problem with that was the plot of the movie was in such a state of total disarray at that point in the film it was impossible to end comfortably.  If he tried to flesh it out, it would have been a three hour film.This whole mess is something I expect to see my wife watching on `Lifetime,' and if it were in that role they may have been able to turn it into a mini-series and freed their hands a bit with their run time.  In that role, it may have been a modest success.  That said though, I certainly do not expect this level of dreck coming from a major motion-picture studio.

132713,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,0792166736,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[1, 3]","I wanted to hate this movie because I'm no fan of Madonna, but also because its platitudes against traditional families are themselves old fashioned.  (It's hard to get uptight when the biggest act of rebellion the friends of an AIDS victim can aspire to is to break into a slow chorus of &quot;American Pie at his funeral).  In the film, Maddona and Rupert Everett play best friends in a dreamy LA when, one night in a drunken frenzy, they conceive a baby and decide to stick it out.  Not amrrying, they decide to become parents nonetheless, never realizing how these seemingly unconnected aspects of their relationship will tear them apart.  After a few years pass, and the baby grows into boyhood, Abbie's (Madonna) relationship with an ambitious but otherwise completely genial investment banker (Ben Bratt) threatens to tear apart what was never a solidly defined family.  A court battle ensues, ala Kramer v. Kramer, and it's never clear which side is supposed to be representing the love of a child over family convention.The plot never really gels, and Rupert Everett's charachter loses something in the last third when he becomes more confrontational, and less fun-loving than in the film's opening (or in &quot;My Best Friend's Wedding&quot;).  Maddonna is a revelation, though.  She can't act, but Abbie's charachter touches a nerve that not even Maddonna can resist: aging.  When you watch Abbie grouse over wrinkles and sagging in a mirror, sadly admitting it's not 1989 anymore, you'll be willing to forgive every line of cheesy acting she's ever read.

132719,A38U2M9OAEJAXJ,0792166736,The Groove,"[6, 10]","""The Next Best Thing"" attempts to accomplish three things: provide a realistic portrait of ""unconventional"" families that include a gay parent, promote tolerance for people regardless of sexual orientation, and, most daunting of all, show that its star, Madonna, can act after all. On all three counts, the movie fails.  And miserably it does.  Madonna is Abbie, a thirtysomething woman who, having been dumped by her boorish boyfriend, desperately tries to ""settle down"" with a husband and raise a family before it's ""too late.""  On one evening, she and her gay pal (Rupert Everett) get severely intoxicated and later discovers she's pregnant (don't ask).  They decide to move in together and raise the kid.  That's as much as I can say without revealing spoilers, but I'll go ahead and add that ""The Next Best Thing"" is an exercise in across-the-board ineptitude.  Madonna's performance just isn't convincing enough to earn our sympathy; she whines, pouts, and tries too hard to register with the audience.  The rest of the characters are badly stereotyped: we have the queens who spend all hours discussing legendary Hollywood actresses, the tough-as-nails Black judge, and the thuggish, fried chicken-eating homophobic rappers.  Worst of all is the script, which unnecessarily adds twist after twist in a desperate attempt to give the movie its much-needed dramatic thrust.  Like ""Mommie Dearest"" and other camp classics, ""The Next Best Thing"" is entertaining for all but the right reasons.  If you're looking for a movie to laugh AT but not laugh WITH, this flick is a perfect Saturday night rental.

And I couldn't bother the DVD until I realised the special features include a video of the soundtrack: AMERICAN PIE. Like our spotlight reviewer Ruma, I grab it since I really like most of the music videos by Madonna. AMERICAN PIE is as great as melancholy to look at.Industrially speaking, this film was released in a ""smart"" timing (Thanks to Rupert Everett who claims to have brought the script to his friend Madonna). Cinema-goers were terribly missing that kind of gay-straight friendship chemistry after MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING. Benjamin Bratt was dating Julia Roberts. And Madonna, what can I say, as usual was desperately in need for the next best surprise at all her risk for her Hollywood status. So no matter how bad we know who can or cannot act sometimes, we still queued up in the movie liners then.It also doesn't matter how this film did not example a good ending for the moral of gay-parenting. Sam (the biological son of Abbie and her ex lived-in Kelvin) is taken care of and loved and will always remember that the gay man Robert has been the father from the very beginning.
