1039000,AUY5RNRV3VCNP,B000LCGJMK,Elizabeth M. Martin,"[11, 11]","5/5 stars definately. It shows the trueness of the heartbreak in love. The cinematography was also brilliant, especially the snow landscapes. It makes me want to travel the world...Also, the acting was amazing, and even when there were crying scenes, they looked SO real, not those fake ones where they put eye drops on their cheeks, but real crying! I tried so hard not to cry with them, but did not succeed. This drama made me cry basically every episode...This caught my attention because I really enjoy depressing things, and I'm also having love issues. And the whole fact about the ""revenge"" plotline made it's own uniqueness. But the characters are believable and lovable at the same time, and even Bi Rain's character grew on my into my favorite character. His acting is at a loss for words, meaning that he was amazing. I've never truly believed in the emotions of a character as I did with Kang Bok Goo. Not on purpose, but I wasted over 5 boxes of tissues on this.This drama of loss truly shows how not everyone's life is perfect and it's not always a 'happily ever after'. I hope anyone thinking of buying will buy this and truly appreciate this as much as I did, and I'm thankful that I own it.",5,Most amazing drama I've ever seen...and that's saying alot...,1198886400,"12 29, 2007",2007,1207,"['5/5', 'stars', 'definately', 'trueness', 'heartbreak', 'love', 'cinematography', 'was', 'also', 'brilliant', 'especially', 'snow', 'landscapes', 'want', 'travel', 'world', 'Also', 'acting', 'was', 'amazing', 'even', 'when', 'were', 'crying', 'scenes', 'looked', 'SO', 'real', 'not', 'fake', 'ones', 'where', 'put', 'eye', 'drops', 'cheeks', 'real', 'crying', 'tried', 'so', 'hard', 'not', 'cry', 'did', 'not', 'succeed', 'drama', 'made', 'cry', 'basically', 'episode', 'caught', 'attention', 'really', 'enjoy', 'depressing', 'things', ""'m"", 'also', 'having', 'love', 'issues', 'whole', 'fact', 'revenge', 'plotline', 'made', 'own', 'uniqueness', 'characters', 'are', 'believable', 'lovable', 'same', 'time', 'even', 'Bi', 'Rain', 'character', 'grew', 'favorite', 'character', 'acting', 'loss', 'words', 'meaning', 'was', 'amazing', ""'ve"", 'never', 'truly', 'believed', 'emotions', 'character', 'did', 'Kang', 'Bok', 'Goo', 'Not', 'purpose', 'wasted', '5', 'boxes', 'tissues', 'this.This', 'drama', 'loss', 'truly', 'how', 'not', 'everyone', 'life', 'perfect', 'not', 'always', ""'happily"", 'ever', 'hope', 'anyone', 'thinking', 'buying', 'will', 'buy', 'truly', 'appreciate', 'as', 'much', 'did', ""'m"", 'thankful', 'own']",A Love to Kill (Korean TV Series)
1039001,A34AWBSX28FA8C,B000LCGJMK,Esmerelda,"[12, 14]","WARNING! THIS IS A MYSTERY. THE EDITORIAL REVIEW ON THE MAIN PAGE HERE CONTAINS A BIG SPOILER, AS DOES THE BACK OF THE BOX, SO IF YOU'RE PLANNING ON BUYING THIS DRAMA, DON'T READ EITHER OF THESE.This is the story of Kang Bok-gu, AKA Dog Bok-gu, (Bi/RAIN), who becomes the bodyguard of a beautiful top Korean movie star in order to be close to her and get revenge on her, as he thinks she is responsible for his brothers suicide attempt and subsequent paralysis.In his quest to get the revenge he wants, he must keep her safe from other predators and various accidents. So---not in any particular order, here are the SAVES of Dog Bok-gu:1. He saves her from being run down by a motorcycle. Note: he almost runs her over with his own motorcycle.2. He saves her from falling off a very high wall onto the concrete below.3. He saves her from being raped.4. He saves her from getting beat up by gangsters.5. When he finds out her boyfriend is physically abusing her, he puts a stop to it.6. He saves her from driving really drunk, in a sort of unusual way.7. He saves her from a rabid fan.8. He saves her from being run over by another motorcycle.9. He saves her from freezing to death overnight in the cold. (This is a tricky one for those of you who have seen this).10. Most of these aren't as ordinary as they sound---they are pretty amazingly done.No. of definite suicide attempts in this drama: 5No. of possible others: 2No. of leading characters in this story who are jealous of other leading characters in this story: 5No. of leading characters who are alcoholic: 1No. of leading characters who are bulimic: 1No. of leading characters who are vegetables: 1No. of leading characters who are mean and vicious: 1No. of leading characters who are just plain nuts: 1The soundtrack is beautiful, the acting is superb, and the story is riveting. Worth every cent and more.Almost forgot: He becomes her personal vampire for a moment, and drinks her blood.  Bi has now done a 'Goth' video. It's somewhere on You Tube, but I can't remember the title of the clip.AND---he kisses her right after she throws up, before she rinses her mouth, and it's not one of your typical Kdram closed mouth sanitary kisses either---it's a full on big open-mouth French kiss. Really big---you get the feeling his mouth could be bigger than her face.Also---if you've seen 'Sangdoo, Let's Go To School', you already  know how much Bi loves to spit, and has obviously spent a lot of time practicing long distance spitting. As the reviewer with the weak stomach said, there is some of that in this film, only it's not really impressive the way it was in 'Sangdoo'.Also, you will see---Bi(Jung Ji Hoon)---the actor, seems to have no fear of the body fluids of others (for real, not fake)---a bit of a stomach turner.  He does a couple of things in the film that I just have to look away from.",5,One of the Best Kdramas,1209600000,"05 1, 2008",2008,2861,"['WARNING', 'THIS', 'MYSTERY', 'THE', 'EDITORIAL', 'REVIEW', 'ON', 'THE', 'MAIN', 'PAGE', 'HERE', 'CONTAINS', 'A', 'BIG', 'SPOILER', 'AS', 'DOES', 'THE', 'BACK', 'THE', 'BOX', 'SO', 'IF', 'YOU', ""'RE"", 'PLANNING', 'ON', 'BUYING', 'THIS', 'DRAMA', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'READ', 'EITHER', 'OF', 'THESE.This', 'story', 'Kang', 'Bok-gu', 'AKA', 'Dog', 'Bok-gu', 'Bi/RAIN', 'who', 'bodyguard', 'beautiful', 'top', 'Korean', 'movie', 'star', 'order', 'be', 'close', 'get', 'revenge', 'responsible', 'brothers', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'subsequent', 'paralysis.In', 'quest', 'get', 'revenge', 'must', 'keep', 'safe', 'other', 'predators', 'various', 'accidents', 'So', '-not', 'particular', 'order', 'here', 'are', 'SAVES', 'Dog', 'Bok-gu:1', 'being', 'run', 'down', 'motorcycle', 'Note', 'almost', 'own', 'motorcycle.2', 'falling', 'off', 'very', 'high', 'wall', 'concrete', 'below.3', 'being', 'raped.4', 'getting', 'beat', 'up', 'gangsters.5', 'When', 'out', 'boyfriend', 'physically', 'abusing', 'stop', 'it.6', 'driving', 'really', 'drunk', 'sort', 'unusual', 'way.7', 'rabid', 'fan.8', 'being', 'run', 'over', 'motorcycle.9', 'freezing', 'death', 'overnight', 'cold', 'tricky', 'one', 'who', 'have', 'seen', '.10', 'Most', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'ordinary', 'sound', '-they', 'are', 'pretty', 'amazingly', 'done.No', 'definite', 'suicide', 'attempts', 'drama', '5No', 'possible', 'others', '2No', 'leading', 'characters', 'story', 'who', 'are', 'jealous', 'other', 'leading', 'characters', 'story', '5No', 'leading', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'alcoholic', '1No', 'leading', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'bulimic', '1No', 'leading', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'vegetables', '1No', 'leading', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'mean', 'vicious', '1No', 'leading', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'nuts', '1The', 'soundtrack', 'beautiful', 'acting', 'superb', 'story', 'riveting', 'Worth', 'cent', 'more.Almost', 'forgot', 'personal', 'vampire', 'moment', 'blood', 'Bi', 'now', 'done', ""'Goth"", 'video', 'somewhere', 'Tube', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'title', 'clip.AND', '-he', 'right', 'up', 'mouth', 'not', 'one', 'typical', 'Kdram', 'closed', 'mouth', 'sanitary', 'kisses', '-it', 'full', 'big', 'open-mouth', 'French', 'kiss', 'Really', 'big', '-you', 'get', 'feeling', 'mouth', 'could', 'be', 'bigger', 'face.Also', ""'ve"", 'seen', ""'Sangdoo"", 'Let', 'Go', 'School', 'already', 'know', 'how', 'much', 'Bi', 'spit', 'obviously', 'spent', 'lot', 'time', 'practicing', 'long', 'distance', 'spitting', 'reviewer', 'weak', 'stomach', 'said', 'film', 'only', 'not', 'really', 'impressive', 'way', 'was', ""'Sangdoo'.Also"", 'will', 'see', '-Bi', 'Jung', 'Ji', 'Hoon', '-the', 'actor', 'have', 'fear', 'body', 'fluids', 'others', 'real', 'not', 'fake', '-a', 'bit', 'stomach', 'turner', 'couple', 'things', 'film', 'just', 'have', 'look', 'away']",A Love to Kill (Korean TV Series)
