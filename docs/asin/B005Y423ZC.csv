Liked it, but found this CD/DVD combo about a month later and went for it.  I am so-o-o glad that I did.  The additional cover songs are great and Adele's warm, bubbly personality comes shining through on the DVD.  Although her voice is not at its best, it's live and I don't expect live performances to match the vocal perfection she could have in a studio version of the songs.  But, with her providing narration on the background of creating her songs and choosing others' songs to cover, this DVD concert is a real treat.  Adele wakes me up on my clock radio (this version) and she seranades me everyday in my car, when I'm not pausing the telly every now and then to watch a song or two from this DVD.

There is no pretense, and she doesn't copy anyone else either in song or in how she dresses.  She doesn't aspire to be a ""skinny-mini"" as she puts it.  She is so completely refreshing as an artist, and these are among the many reasons her fans simply adore her, me included.  But above all, it's about that glorious voice!  While Adele doesn't sound at all like the late Eva Cassidy, she is the first singer since Eva to pack so much beauty and raw emotion into her interpretation of a song, and she makes us feel that raw emotion.

She does not speak a sophisticated English, and the between song patter is like the disclaimers you hear at the end of a radio ad.  You know, motor mouth.

She's a youngster, yet she sings with a maturity that suggests already having lived a long and rich life.On the other hand, when she banters with the audience, she can be downright crass, making it clear that her British background has almost surely not been upper-crusty.  Her youth becomes strikingly evident.The enigma actually works though, because it gives Adele an air of authenticity.

While I could list a million superlatives to describe how wonderful her singing is, I will simply say:  She moved me.Not only is she beautiful on the outside, but it is obvious that she has a beautiful soul.  Being a writer myself, I know that the two most inspirational feelings in the world are love and heartache.  She has been impacted by them both.Sadly, the record companies in the United States of America are only interested in pushing and promoting tasteless trash.

But an Adele show is the antitheses of those types of shows. On Adele: Live At The Royal Albert Hall, she gives us what we need most of all - good music. While other artists give us their alter-egos in wild make-up, colorful hair, and outrageous outfits, Adele gives us herself where you feel as if you're having a conversation with a good friend. Her personality in all its rawness shines through, and she is intelligently expressive and emotional in her delivery of each song. With that type of power, there is no need for all the other stuff. '21' will stand the test of time, and this concert DVD is one for the collection.The only song from '21' she desn't perform is ""He Won't Go"" which I love and seem to be in the minority. But for me the inclusion of her performance of Bonnie Raitt's ""I Can't Make You Love Me"" and the Steeldrivers' ""If It Hadn't Been For Love"" more than makes up for its omission. She also performs her biggest hits from '19' including ""Chasing Pavements"" and concert-opener ""Hometown Glory"".Adele was plagued with vocal nodules during the year that resulted with a number of postponements and ultimately the cancellation of the last leg of her North American tour. Knowing this, you may be worried about the performances on this DVD. No need. Adele is in excellent form here. Many great reviews have already been written and videos samples from the DVD are available to help you decide, so I won't repeat what's already been said. But if you were heart-broken because you held a ticket to one of her shows that was eventually canceled like I did, this DVD is the next best thing.

On the exceptional set, Adele proves that she's more than a `studio' vocalist, lending her powerful pipes to this fine compilation recorded in 2011.  While most of the arrangements maintain their `sanctity' in accordance with their studio counterparts, the effects are not boring, but rather just a solid, live version. There are few quibbles making Live a solid addition to any hardcore Adele fan's library.""Hometown Glory"" opens the effort with a few changes, namely a mysterious ostinato to open the cut.  The dramatic use of the lower register of the piano is a nice touch and finally the cut settles into the piano-driven hit from 19.  The pitch by Adele is nearly perfect and proves to be a solid way to open the set. ""I'll Be Waiting"" follows, exhibiting top-notch mixing given the live-sound.  The supporting background vocals on the refrain sound particularly strong here. ""Don't You Remember"" keeps up the momentum, doing a fine job of preserving the original arrangement.  Adele's vocal performance is solid and dramatic by all means with no qualms to speak of.""Turning Tables"" begins ever so slightly slower than the studio recording, but still preserves most of the nuances and vocal affections of the original.  The original does eclipse this live take, but ""Turning Tables"" sounds very solid live. ""Set Fire to the Rain"" is a better performance, with highly assertive lead vocals by Adele.  The producers have done a fabulous job of ensuring that Adele's lead vocals are highly present within the mix.  The grit achieved is marvelous to say the least.  ""If It Hadn't Been For Love"" is a nice cover performance, adding something different for listeners.  ""My Same"" is captivating as well, with Adele doing a fantastic job of presenting the jazz idiom.""Take It All"" preserves the original performance, though the background vocals absence are a slight quibble; they would've taken ""Take It All"" live over the top. ""Rumour Has It"" is well executed as far as maintaining the arrangement and personnel.  ""Right As Rain"" does a fine job of preserving the arrangement and breaking up lengthier songs.  ""One and Only"" is perfect, achieving a sound mix and pure, capable vocals by Adele.  As great as the interpretation of ""One and Only"" is, adding some horns would've made the cut truly cutting edge and `killer.'  If there was one other quibble musically, it might be that at the end the background vocals from the choir fade out - an issue that also occurred with the original. Imagine the added power with retaining the choral vocals.  Regardless, ""One and Only"" is a brilliant performance.""Lovesong"" is fine, proving no more or less exciting than the studio version.  The only quibble might be that ""One and Only"" and ""Lovesong"" could have been spaced out considering their consummate length, however, they fall the same way on 21. ""Chasing Pavements""  is solid, though a slightly less refined performance than the studio version.  ""I Can't Make You Love Me"" is a superb performance and perfect choice of song for Adele to cover.  ""Make You Feel My Love"" is also a solid Bob Dylan cover, keeping the momentum of the live set lofty.  ""Someone Like You"" and ""Rolling in the Deep"" close the effort particularly soundly, as expected.  ""Someone Like You"" is the better performance of the two, but ""Rolling in the Deep"" is none too shabby itself.Overall,Adele Live At The Royal Albert Hall (DVD/CD Edited Version)is a fine addition to any fan's library.  Adele sounds as powerful and recognizable as ever, proving to be more than just a studio singer - but did she really have to prove that?

Far be it from me to be critical of any of her songs or of her.  She may be the first musical artist that my ex-wives and I all agree on.  Adele has an amazing voice and is able to write equally amazing heartfelt songs.  This isn't unique to her obviously, but Adele manages to make the audience realize these are snippets from her life and often her hurt shows.  In previous live performances that I've seen, Adele always comes across nervous and a bit shy and overwhelmed.  Not here.  Complete with a fellow Brit, Dusty Springfield bouffant, she seems amazed at her success but approachable, all at the same time.  Her interaction with the fans between songs is sometimes profane and pretty funny.  You won't find much new with respect to the songs if you know Adele's recorded work.  All but two are on her two previous albums.  She adds Nashville's Steeldrivers' ""If It Hadn't Been for Love"" and a tearful cover of Bonnie Raitt's classic ""I Can't Make You Love Me."" The picture on this Blu ray is excellent as you would expect, but the editing and directing is choppy as is often the case these days.  I'm all for audience shots, but they should be longer than 2 microseconds if you want to convey something other than a headache.Because of Adele's voice timbre, I noticed it became a bit shrill during certain songs while listening in the DTS-HD setting.  In that surround mode, her voice is very upfront in the center channel.  When I engaged the Dolby Digital 2-channel option all was well.  You may have to adjust your center channel or just go with the stereo mode.  This package includes a CD of all the songs without the chit chat.

1505475,A3DYIGOLWS5CNS,B005Y423ZC,Niel Rishoi,"[3, 4]","This young woman deserves all her fame, acclaim and stardom. Adele's musical sophistication, instincts and individuality in one so young is extraordinary. And that voice. It's of a full, deep hue, with amazing resonance and ethereal overtones; she uses it consummately, and phrases with a great deal of maturity and skill.""21"" is by now an international phenomenon, and it's likely to be recognized as one of the seminal, must-have recordings for vocal buffs. This album has crossed over to many varying cultures, and it's not hard to understand why.It's real. Adele is real, and she sings about real feelings, emotions and nuances. Her lyrics are arrestingly original, of her own vernacular and manner of expressions. Adele is like no one else: and *that* is the mark of a true, individual artist.What's remarkable about this concert, recorded at London's Royal Albert Hall in September of 2011, is that it is in many ways better than the studio recordings that preceded it. I have one major complaint about the ""21"" album, and that is the dry, digital acoustic. There is no warmth of space around Adele's voice, and she sounds very closely microphoned. Too, the engineering put the recording level way too high so that it causes a serious overload, with the result of distortion. However, on the vinyl incarnation (which I also bought), the levels are somehow much more even and natural.This DVD, then, appears to put Adele's huge voice, in the space of a large theater, in its proper venue.What I was not prepared for is how much more mellow, full and sweeter Adele's voice sounds here: it is at times an elemental force of nature.But what this concert captures is the *compleat* persona of Adele, and you see why she's certifiably, a genuine star artist. Her new, slimmer, blonde look here is quite becoming: she's breathtakingly gorgeous, and the radiance that emanates from her is unmistakeable. Her whole being is out there, larger than life; it jumps out to the audience, her rapport with them sealed, and they're smitten. On the one hand, she's everyone's chatty girlfriend, and friend girl; on the other, she's a song goddess.Adele is just as captivating speaking as singing: she could easily be a stand-up comic (and is far funnier than some of the ones out there). She's adorably refreshing, spontaneous, and vastly entertaining. Delightfully,laugh-out-loud funny, Adele is as real as real gets, and there's not a phony, pretentious bone in her body. She plays around with her accent, using it with great comic skill to relate her stories.  What also comes through is an absolutely genuine sincerity, and really shows heartfelt appreciation and generosity of spirit to her audiences. Adele has a singular commodity that cannot be bought or faked, and that is charm.When it comes to the music, however, Adele gets serious, and she delivers, and, as they say, then some. She offers a generous selection from both her ""19"" and ""21"" albums, with a few others included, ""Lovesong,"" ""I Can't Make You Love Me,"" ""If It Hadn't Been For Love,"" and ""Make YOu Feel My Love.""But the heart of this concert are Adele's own compositions, and in this live setting, they gain an extra excitement and dimension. By the way, there are no thrashing dancers, cheap staging/lighting/special effects to be found here: Adele doesn't need them.Personally speaking, my favorite number, and her performance of it in this set, is ""Set Fire To The Rain.""  Adele far outdoes her studio rendition here, singing with an inflamed fervor and white-heat passion; her voice soars with amazing abandon and it expands into the hall with overwhelming impact. The phrase ""And it threw us into the flames"" is simply magical; the ending, repeated runs to ""Let it burn"" indeed do burn with refulgent intensity (watch her face as she ends the song: she's living the emotion).Adele wisely ends the concert with her monster-mega hit ""Rolling In The Deep,"" which rouses the audience, as she often turns the microphone to them to sing along - which they do, perfectly in tune and on the beat. There is such a sense of occasion here, of pure, exalting joy, of glowing warmth and high spirits, you may find yourself clapping and singing along. The good time and happiness evinced by all signals Adele's heart-capture of her public; her legend is sealed.Thank you, Adele, for bringing great music to us all.",5,"A magical, for-the-ages concert by a real artist.",1335571200,"04 28, 2012",2012,4368,"['young', 'woman', 'fame', 'acclaim', 'stardom', 'Adele', 'musical', 'sophistication', 'instincts', 'individuality', 'one', 'so', 'young', 'extraordinary', 'voice', 'full', 'deep', 'hue', 'amazing', 'resonance', 'ethereal', 'overtones', 'consummately', 'great', 'deal', 'maturity', 'skill', '21', 'now', 'international', 'phenomenon', 'likely', 'be', 'recognized', 'one', 'seminal', 'must-have', 'recordings', 'vocal', 'buffs', 'album', 'crossed', 'many', 'varying', 'cultures', 'not', 'hard', 'understand', 'why.It', 'real', 'Adele', 'real', 'real', 'feelings', 'emotions', 'nuances', 'lyrics', 'are', 'arrestingly', 'original', 'own', 'vernacular', 'manner', 'expressions', 'Adele', 'one', 'else', '*that*', 'mark', 'true', 'individual', 'artist.What', 'remarkable', 'concert', 'recorded', 'London', 'Royal', 'Albert', 'Hall', 'September', '2011', 'many', 'ways', 'better', 'studio', 'recordings', 'preceded', 'have', 'one', 'major', 'complaint', '21', 'album', 'dry', 'digital', 'acoustic', 'warmth', 'space', 'Adele', 'voice', 'very', 'closely', 'microphoned', 'Too', 'engineering', 'put', 'recording', 'level', 'way', 'too', 'high', 'serious', 'overload', 'result', 'distortion', 'However', 'vinyl', 'incarnation', 'also', 'bought', 'levels', 'are', 'somehow', 'much', 'more', 'even', 'natural.This', 'DVD', 'then', 'put', 'Adele', 'huge', 'voice', 'space', 'large', 'theater', 'proper', 'was', 'not', 'prepared', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'mellow', 'full', 'sweeter', 'Adele', 'voice', 'here', 'times', 'elemental', 'force', 'nature.But', 'what', 'concert', '*compleat*', 'persona', 'Adele', 'see', 'why', 'certifiably', 'genuine', 'star', 'artist', 'new', 'slimmer', 'blonde', 'look', 'here', 'quite', 'becoming', 'breathtakingly', 'gorgeous', 'radiance', 'unmistakeable', 'whole', 'being', 'there', 'larger', 'life', 'out', 'audience', 'rapport', 'sealed', ""'re"", 'smitten', 'one', 'hand', 'everyone', 'chatty', 'girlfriend', 'friend', 'girl', 'other', 'song', 'goddess.Adele', 'just', 'captivating', 'speaking', 'singing', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'stand-up', 'comic', 'far', 'funnier', 'ones', 'there', 'adorably', 'refreshing', 'spontaneous', 'vastly', 'entertaining', 'Delightfully', 'laugh-out-loud', 'funny', 'Adele', 'as', 'real', 'real', 'not', 'phony', 'pretentious', 'bone', 'body', 'around', 'accent', 'using', 'great', 'comic', 'skill', 'relate', 'stories', 'What', 'also', 'through', 'absolutely', 'genuine', 'sincerity', 'really', 'heartfelt', 'appreciation', 'generosity', 'spirit', 'audiences', 'Adele', 'singular', 'commodity', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'bought', 'faked', 'charm.When', 'music', 'however', 'Adele', 'serious', 'delivers', 'say', 'then', 'generous', 'selection', '19', '21', 'albums', 'few', 'others', 'included', 'Lovesong', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Make', 'Love', 'Me', 'Had', ""n't"", 'Been', 'Love', 'Make', 'YOu', 'Feel', 'My', 'Love', 'heart', 'concert', 'are', 'Adele', 'own', 'compositions', 'live', 'setting', 'gain', 'extra', 'excitement', 'dimension', 'way', 'are', 'thrashing', 'dancers', 'cheap', 'staging/lighting/special', 'effects', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'Adele', ""n't"", 'need', 'them.Personally', 'speaking', 'favorite', 'number', 'performance', 'set', 'Set', 'Fire', 'Rain', 'Adele', 'far', 'studio', 'rendition', 'here', 'singing', 'inflamed', 'fervor', 'white-heat', 'passion', 'voice', 'soars', 'amazing', 'abandon', 'hall', 'overwhelming', 'impact', 'phrase', 'threw', 'flames', 'simply', 'magical', 'ending', 'repeated', 'runs', 'Let', 'burn', 'indeed', 'do', 'burn', 'refulgent', 'intensity', 'watch', 'face', 'song', 'living', 'emotion', 'wisely', 'concert', 'monster-mega', 'hit', 'Rolling', 'Deep', 'audience', 'often', 'microphone', 'sing', 'do', 'perfectly', 'tune', 'beat', 'such', 'sense', 'occasion', 'here', 'pure', 'exalting', 'joy', 'glowing', 'warmth', 'high', 'spirits', 'may', 'find', 'clapping', 'singing', 'along', 'good', 'time', 'happiness', 'evinced', 'signals', 'Adele', 'heart-capture', 'public', 'legend', 'sealed.Thank', 'Adele', 'bringing', 'great', 'music']",Adele: Live At The Royal Albert Hall
1505476,AZ77K7BCBK8V,B005Y423ZC,Padderz,"[0, 0]","The mighty Adele and her little concert in the heart of London town, at the Royal Albert Hall no less. That lofty venue is often filled by pomp and ceremony and with Adele, you get none of that....just her amazing voice. A voice that touches and flourishes in whatever part of the world you are listening in.A lot has already been said about her ability to convey so much through her music and its all true, so I will focus this review on why I think you should run, not walk to buy this DVD.1. Her music. Her voice. Her interpretations of her songs and classic covers.2. Her banter. I know many have said that she swears a bit, but I'm a Brit, and that is how most of us communicate. She isn't trying to sell your a version of herself, she is just being herself and I love her for it. You get a real view of a young woman from London and this DVD captures her awe of playing in such a venerable establishment. Whilst most artists would put on airs and graces in such surroundings, the fact that she doesn't says a sh*tload about her. She shares the stories of what she was going through when writing her songs and that insight makes the experience better for it. If you love the artist, love what she represents cos that gives her the ability to write songs that come straight from her heart and touches that part in all of us that can relate. I do wish that my American friends would get off their moral high horses about swearing.....its daily life in the world that I and Adele come from. If you want to pretend that you live in such a perfect cookie cutter world that has nothing to do with being the BIGGEST affecting problem facing your southern neighbours and their drug wars...that you have not got involved in wars with no relevance to you (except you need something from those countries), then by all means remain in a state of blissful 50's innocence when swearing is the biggest crime imaginable.3. The audience. No screaming fans just cos they love her and she is the zeitgeist of the moment but because we adore everything her voice does for us. Some touching audience shots show how her music bring couples, friends and maybe even strangers closer together. I love the shot of loving couples clinging to each other and singing her words to each other. It means something more to them than just a song. The bits when the audience sing Someone like you back to Adele is heartwarming and uplighting and clearly touches a tearful Adele.4. The simple staging. How many other superstars can get away with so little on stage and yet impact on us more that those artists who have to fill their shows with a complete circus act to create the spectacle.5. The film. I have the UK version and I am not at all sure what you get in the US but I found the cinematography perfect, so I wholeheartedly disagree with complains on the quality. Its a brilliant conceived, simple execution. You get Adele, end of.6. Her laugh - its frigging infectious and uplifting.Buy it if you want to experience a global talent with her feet securely rooted in reality, but whose voice transcends gravity.",5,I swear that hers is the voice I want to hear on my deathbed,1366934400,"04 26, 2013",2013,3088,"['mighty', 'Adele', 'little', 'concert', 'heart', 'London', 'town', 'Royal', 'Albert', 'Hall', 'less', 'lofty', 'venue', 'often', 'filled', 'pomp', 'ceremony', 'Adele', 'get', 'none', 'amazing', 'voice', 'voice', 'touches', 'flourishes', 'part', 'world', 'are', 'listening', 'in.A', 'lot', 'already', 'been', 'said', 'ability', 'convey', 'so', 'much', 'music', 'true', 'will', 'focus', 'review', 'why', 'think', 'should', 'run', 'not', 'walk', 'buy', 'DVD.1', 'music', 'voice', 'interpretations', 'songs', 'classic', 'covers.2', 'banter', 'know', 'many', 'have', 'said', 'bit', ""'m"", 'Brit', 'how', 'most', 'communicate', ""n't"", 'trying', 'sell', 'version', 'herself', 'just', 'being', 'love', 'get', 'real', 'view', 'young', 'woman', 'London', 'DVD', 'awe', 'playing', 'such', 'venerable', 'establishment', 'Whilst', 'most', 'artists', 'would', 'put', 'airs', 'graces', 'such', 'surroundings', 'fact', ""n't"", 'sh*tload', 'shares', 'stories', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'when', 'writing', 'songs', 'insight', 'experience', 'better', 'love', 'artist', 'love', 'what', 'cos', 'ability', 'write', 'songs', 'come', 'straight', 'heart', 'touches', 'part', 'can', 'relate', 'do', 'wish', 'American', 'friends', 'would', 'get', 'off', 'moral', 'high', 'horses', 'swearing', '..its', 'daily', 'life', 'world', 'Adele', 'come', 'want', 'pretend', 'live', 'perfect', 'cookie', 'cutter', 'world', 'nothing', 'do', 'being', 'BIGGEST', 'affecting', 'problem', 'facing', 'southern', 'neighbours', 'drug', 'wars', 'have', 'not', 'got', 'involved', 'wars', 'relevance', 'need', 'something', 'countries', 'then', 'means', 'remain', 'state', 'blissful', '50', 'innocence', 'when', 'swearing', 'biggest', 'crime', 'imaginable.3', 'audience', 'No', 'screaming', 'fans', 'just', 'cos', 'love', 'zeitgeist', 'moment', 'adore', 'everything', 'voice', 'touching', 'audience', 'shots', 'show', 'how', 'music', 'bring', 'couples', 'friends', 'maybe', 'even', 'strangers', 'closer', 'together', 'love', 'shot', 'loving', 'couples', 'clinging', 'other', 'singing', 'words', 'other', 'something', 'more', 'just', 'song', 'bits', 'when', 'audience', 'sing', 'Someone', 'back', 'Adele', 'heartwarming', 'uplighting', 'clearly', 'tearful', 'Adele.4', 'simple', 'staging', 'How', 'many', 'other', 'superstars', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'so', 'little', 'stage', 'yet', 'impact', 'more', 'artists', 'who', 'have', 'fill', 'shows', 'complete', 'circus', 'act', 'create', 'spectacle.5', 'film', 'have', 'UK', 'version', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'get', 'US', 'found', 'cinematography', 'perfect', 'wholeheartedly', 'disagree', 'complains', 'quality', 'brilliant', 'conceived', 'simple', 'execution', 'get', 'Adele', 'end', 'of.6', 'laugh', 'frigging', 'infectious', 'uplifting.Buy', 'want', 'experience', 'global', 'talent', 'feet', 'securely', 'rooted', 'reality', 'voice', 'gravity']",Adele: Live At The Royal Albert Hall

It was hard to believe that this matronly figure is in her early twenties. Adele resembled a frumpy forty something.Don't get me wrong, there are some decent songs. But on the whole this concert reminds me of those singers who talk a lot to fill up a show. My eyes wandered from the TV screen during her nasal banter. Her inane cackle was absolutely grating and at one point I wished she would just shut up and do her songs.The audio disk was a lot better as it cuts out 30 minutes of sometimes littered with obscenities irritating chatter, thus allowing you to focus on and appreciate her music.This DVD was heavily advertised on TV and aggressively pushed by the shops.

I personally liked the way it is filmed, not too jumpy and plenty of close shots of Adele. As for the performance, I've seen videos of her on Jools Holland's TV show (on youtube) and in some of those her voice was better than it is during this concert. She was obviously having some voice problems around this time, but overall her voice sounds very good. Adele is a great singer who has a powerful voice and she puts a lot of feeling and style into her vocals. She is also a very good songwriter who manages to connect with her audience. Overall, this is a bright young talent and a good show. She jokes around a lot and tells stories and you can see that she truly respects her fans.  You also get a stereo cd along with the dvd, good value.

It is almost impossible to find someone you don't know that makes you feel as if though they took the words right out of your mouth and put them in song. She said that she concentrated on making music for the ears, not the eyes, but in this video, you're clearly able to see that the eyes get a treat as well- she is breathtaking.In a modern age, where concerts rely on special effects, pyro, dancers, and theatrics, Adele manages to achieve the same results one would get from such shows by just having a backing band, 2 background singers, and a stool- her voice IS the show! I will be honest, I was worried about Adele having so many throat problems while on tour and when she had surgery in early summer, I was expecting a drastic notice in her voice. You do hear her throat a little scratchy in the dvd/cd but the ""imperfections"" only managed to bring more truth to the songs.It should be in everyone's bucket list to catch an Adele show- I guarantee she is not to be missed!1.""Hometown Glory""2.""I'll Be Waiting""3.""Don't You Remember""4.""Turning Tables""5.""Set Fire to the Rain""6.""If It Hadn't Been for Love""7.""My Same""8.""Take It All""9.""Rumour Has It""10.""Right As Rain""11.""One & Only""12.""Lovesong""13.""Chasing Pavements""14.""I Can't Make You Love Me""15.""Make You Feel My Love16.""Someone Like You""17.""Rolling in the Deep""",5,Adele will take your breathe away....again.,1320883200,"11 10, 2011",2011,1427,"['was', 'able', 'preview', 'pleasure', 'call', 'one', 'biggest', 'Adele', 'fans', 'ever', 'almost', 'impossible', 'find', 'someone', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'feel', 'took', 'words', 'right', 'mouth', 'put', 'song', 'said', 'concentrated', 'making', 'music', 'ears', 'not', 'eyes', 'video', ""'re"", 'clearly', 'able', 'see', 'eyes', 'get', 'treat', 'well-', 'breathtaking.In', 'modern', 'age', 'where', 'concerts', 'rely', 'special', 'effects', 'pyro', 'dancers', 'theatrics', 'Adele', 'achieve', 'same', 'results', 'one', 'would', 'get', 'such', 'shows', 'just', 'having', 'backing', 'band', '2', 'background', 'singers', 'stool-', 'voice', 'show', 'will', 'be', 'honest', 'was', 'worried', 'Adele', 'having', 'so', 'many', 'throat', 'problems', 'tour', 'when', 'had', 'surgery', 'early', 'summer', 'was', 'expecting', 'drastic', 'notice', 'voice', 'do', 'hear', 'throat', 'little', 'scratchy', 'dvd/cd', 'imperfections', 'only', 'managed', 'bring', 'more', 'truth', 'songs.It', 'should', 'be', 'everyone', 'bucket', 'list', 'catch', 'Adele', 'show-', 'guarantee', 'not', 'be', 'missed', '1', 'Hometown', 'Glory', '2', ""'ll"", 'Be', 'Waiting', '3', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Remember', '4', 'Turning', 'Tables', '5', 'Set', 'Fire', 'Rain', '6', 'Had', ""n't"", 'Been', 'Love', '7', 'Same', '8', 'Take', 'All', '9', 'Rumour', '10', 'Right', 'Rain', '11', 'One', 'Only', '12.', 'Lovesong', '13', 'Chasing', 'Pavements', '14', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Make', 'Love', 'Me', '15', 'Make', 'Feel', 'My', 'Love16', 'Someone', '17', 'Rolling', 'Deep']",Adele: Live At The Royal Albert Hall

The better 'hi-def' YouTube videos at 720p has better details, and the pixelations were unforgivable. I am left standing pondering of the chances that the DVD would have had a better video-quality since, unfortunately, the BluRay players activate their 'upscaling' feature only for DVDs but not for BlyRays which, in this case, sorely needed it.The audio quality too, though the lable claims to be DTS-HD, was found wanting. Her vocals were not as rich as you hear from her CD but the sheer power and melody of her voice more than makes up for it.To summarise, you don't need me #or anyone else for that matter# to tell you that the concert was simply amazing! Her ""someone like you"" alone was worth the price of admission. I was, however, left yearning for the audio-visual immersiveness of the 'An evening with the Dixie-Chicks' DVD --- a disc that the producers should have taken a leaf off of instead of dumping this shoddy product on the people who make their paycheque. Rest assured you will not be disappointed as Adele takes you away into her musical reverie and almost makes you forget the shoddy audio-visual production.#5 stars for the concert, 1 star for the shoddy production#",3,The concert is amazing!
