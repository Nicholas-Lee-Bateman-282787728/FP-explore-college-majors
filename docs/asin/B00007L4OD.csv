731296,AE0E6UII0VSZA,B00007L4OD,Blake Kleiner,"[60, 62]","Joseph and Maria are about to be married. They are riding to the wedding chapel in separate limousines-black for him, white for her, of course. Joseph rides with his best friend, Tanner, confiding all those last minute wedding day jitters. Maria rides with her parents, feeling a little nauseous from her nerves. Her mother warns her not to get any vomit on her dress. They arrive at the chapel, and all that nervous tension fades when they look into each other's eyes at the altar. Everything seems just normal for this couple at the precipice of their life together.At first.Seven months later, Joseph and Maria are already feuding over obsessive behaviors, emotional disconnection, inadequate bedroom performance, and an unwillingness to start a family. There's trouble in paradise, and just when things couldn't get any worse, it appears as if Maria is seeing a local sex therapist by the name of Balthazar. This is what every man dreads: Not only is his wife sleeping with another man, she's paying him for it. Fantabulous.So far, aside from the quick pace and attention to detail, ""Bliss"" seems geared to become a formulaic romance story about a troubled newlywed couple. But it is when Joseph and Balthazar first meet that the film shows its true colors, and becomes one of the most honest, emotionally wrenching films ever made about love, sex, and abuse. It strips us of the awareness that we are watching a movie as we become completely engrossed in these lives we care so much about.As Joseph agrees with Balthazar that traditional therapy is not the answer to his wife's many psychological troubles, the heart of the film becomes the discussions between the two men. Brutally honest discussions about sex, love, and the secrets of all their pasts when they finally come to light in the climax of the film.All the characters are played with award-worthy style: Craig Sheffer as Joseph is remarkably strong-willed, hinting very subliminally at the wounded man beneath. Sheryl Lee, one of the great actresses working in film, is so sympathetic as Maria, that even when we are disgusted at her choices in the marriage, we are still with her because we can sense something wrong beyond her control. The big role here, though, belongs to Terence Stamp as the sex therapist Balthazar. This is one of the great performances not nominated for an Oscar. Stamp, instead of simply making Balthazar an all-knowing caricature of a therapist, reveals himself gradually, and emerges as one of the most interesting, well-layered characters of the cinema.""Bliss"" is the only film ever made by writer-director Lance Young, but I pray to God that it is not his last. A first effort this astonishing deserves a worthy follow-up. Along with ""American Beauty,"" this is probably neck and neck for my all-time favorite film.

It was loving of him to want to please her. The sexual abuse was a little trite but I guess that IS a common reason for dysfunction.Sheryl Lee was pretty bad, and was a very odd casting choice.

This is the story, or case, if you will, of a young woman who has been completely and systematically abused by her father and then manages to find a husband (what a surprise)who also sees her as really just a sex object.  Both men profess love for her, but each man just really uses her for sexual gratification.  This film pulls none of its punches in dealing with this difficult subject and manages to integrate many, many ideas (from different psychosexual, spiritual and religious belief systems)into a wonderful philosophical and therapeutic whole...that works!  At least it works in the context of the film's story told through these fictional characters. The genius of this film is that it both tells you (gives the viewer enough verbal explanation of theory and belief systems) and SHOWS how and why these people behave as they do in a very organic, plot-driven way.""Bliss"" is not for everyone.

731304,AJV5NWT37PA7Z,B00007L4OD,Roger Boon,"[5, 5]","Bliss is a powerful and absorbing movie which explore the nature of adult sexuality and love. The plot revolves around the relationship of a newly married yuppie couple,Steve and Maria.We quickly discover that Maria is a compulsive neurotic bordering on the psychotic who is already in therapy and who soon reveals herself to be incapable of having an orgasm. Although an acutely sensitive person she is essentially very loving and copes by faking it. This leads her and eventually her husband to meet with Baltazzar, a sex therapist played with a beguiling calm charisma by Terence Stamp.They thus begin a difficult journey leading to some very important discoveries about themselves. On this journey the Director, Lance Young, engages strongly with such themes as the very nature of sex and love and our capacity to fully give.Steve is a reasonably sensitive man, but like most men has to deal with a strong sexual libido and a dominant male culture which encourages us to put its satisfaction first.His journey is therefore towards increasing awareness and selflessness which ultimately brings its own rewards as he begins to understand the nature of real love and to be able to give and receive it.The sex we see is never gratuitous and has an emotional reality which is rooted in the context of this developing relationship. It is light years away from porn and the simplistic banality of much Hollywood sexual depiction. I suspect many men will be challenged by it in the same way Steve was by the situation he found himself faced with, but it is a journey worth taking.Craig Sheffer and Sheryl Lee give performances as the young couple which ultimately draw us into the movie,but it is Stamp who holds the film together supported by an engaging and often beautiful sound track that heightens its mood.There is a nice twist at the end when Baltazzar embarks on his own new relationship and Steve wryly reflects on the difference between giving advice and putting it into practice with someone you love and whose personality you therefore accept as part of the deal.A film for adults with open hearts and minds.
