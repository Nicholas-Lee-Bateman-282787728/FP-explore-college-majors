Some of the arrangements were over the top, and I didn't hear the tone in is voice that I remembered on his previous tv appearances.",3,Somewhat disappointed,1296259200,"01 29, 2011",2011,245,"['like', 'young', 'mans', 'voice', 'thought', 'was', 'poor', 'average', 'attempt', 'revive', 'timeless', 'classics', 'arrangements', 'were', 'top', 'did', ""n't"", 'hear', 'tone', 'voice', 'remembered', 'previous', 'tv', 'appearances']",N/A

Not only can you hear his great voice, you get to see him sing.These are the same songs that are on his CD, TRIED AND TRUE, but seeing him sing them with his facial expressions adds a lot.I love ALL of the songs, especially BUILD ME UP BUTTERCUP, MOON RIVER, MISTY, SUSPICIOUS MINDS, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE, WHAT KIND OF FOOL AM I?,CRYING (WITH LINDA EDER), and especially the encore, UNCHAINED MELODY.The lighting on this DVD is interesting.  The Band and backup singers add to the fun.  Clay moves around the stage and gives us a few stories.  He surprises us with a song by Ruben Stoddard.If you couldn't get to Raleigh in March to see this concert, this is the next best thing.  It is surprising how different songs show different parts of Clay's talent.I recommennd that you buy this with the extras and the short CD so you can listen to Clay whereever you are.  Excellent DVD.  I hope he makes one of Broadway songs soon. If you want to get SOLTAIRE, buy Clay's Playlist.",5,Clay Aiken in Concert shines!,1280361600,"07 29, 2010",2010,1027,"['DVD', 'Clay', 'Concert', 'thrilled', 'daughter', 'Not', 'only', 'can', 'hear', 'great', 'voice', 'get', 'see', 'sing.These', 'are', 'same', 'songs', 'are', 'CD', 'TRIED', 'AND', 'TRUE', 'seeing', 'sing', 'facial', 'expressions', 'lot.I', 'love', 'ALL', 'songs', 'especially', 'BUILD', 'ME', 'UP', 'BUTTERCUP', 'MOON', 'RIVER', 'MISTY', 'SUSPICIOUS', 'MINDS', 'IT', 'IMPOSSIBLE', 'WHAT', 'KIND', 'OF', 'FOOL', 'AM', 'CRYING', 'WITH', 'LINDA', 'EDER', 'especially', 'encore', 'UNCHAINED', 'MELODY.The', 'lighting', 'DVD', 'interesting', 'Band', 'backup', 'singers', 'add', 'fun', 'Clay', 'stage', 'few', 'stories', 'song', 'Ruben', 'Stoddard.If', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'Raleigh', 'March', 'see', 'concert', 'next', 'best', 'thing', 'surprising', 'how', 'different', 'songs', 'show', 'different', 'parts', 'Clay', 'talent.I', 'recommennd', 'buy', 'extras', 'short', 'CD', 'can', 'listen', 'Clay', 'are', 'Excellent', 'DVD', 'hope', 'one', 'Broadway', 'songs', 'soon', 'want', 'get', 'SOLTAIRE', 'buy', 'Clay', 'Playlist']",N/A
