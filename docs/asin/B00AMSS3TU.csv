Since I have seen them all and don't plan on revisiting I didn't really care much. You can also find them on youtube or the net most likely. It does have commentary and that is really all I need. The picture looks amazing with a good solid bitrate.Green Mile is more or less a great film with a fairly solid bluray transfer. It does have a bitrate that is pretty low around 18Mbps, but the film is dark and very long, which should help it along some. I wouldn't call it the greatest transfer but for under 10 bucks I am not going to complain much. Most people know enough about these films from other reviews. I'd say both are classics in the genre they are attributed to. Seeing them in hi-def is well worth your time. Just make sure you get a good deal on the set.
