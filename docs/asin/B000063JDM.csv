I have this on DVD as it is. Maybe I might want to buy another one just to have a spare just in case something happens to the DVD I already got. But, asking Twenty something dollars for this video & $27.00 from amazon.com is highway & great train robbery !!! I bought my copy on DVD at Circuit City when it was still around for I think like $5.99 or $6.99 maybe in 2002. I think movies depreciate in value , not appreciate. I don't know who thinks or thought that spending up to & over 20 dollars for this video is a good idea , but I thought amazon.com  is supposed to have good prices. I think I should go to a local store where they sell movies like this , maybe at F.Y.E. ( For Your Entertainment ) store & buy it for less than $20.00 . Man , amazon.com .... You guys are getting more & more expensive. This is an excellent movie as I said , but after knowing that I bought this movie , maybe for 10 dollars after tax included , I think people are getting swindled out of their hard earned cash to spend double that. Look for it in stores first. If they don't have it there , then go out on a limb , mad money style , & go crazy & buy this for the outrageous asking price , I guess....

""Men At Work"" is to me a timeless classic. I thought the script was hilarious containing many great quotable one-liners and terrific comedic performances. The brothers Estevez/Sheen play off each other well and it just occurred to me that it would probably be interesting if they starred together in a buddy cop movie but I'm getting ahead of myself here.This movie is terrific until the end where it seems like Emilio ran out of time or money because it just seems to end without resolution to some of the story lines. This movie is admittedly silly but that doesn't matter because it makes me laugh which is about the only requirement I have anymore for movies. The script was funny and the characters were as well. So what if the story line itself was like cardboard. Aside from Charlie and Emilio, I thought the hitmen as well as the garbage men nemeses and even the bicycle cops nemeses were all funny. I always enjoy Keith David who is a flawless character actor and John Getz is always amazing whether he is playing a good guy or bad guy.This movie stands the test of time meaning it is still funny to me after all these years unlike some other movies that I thought I would love forever such as ""The Breakfast Club"" which now is a bit boring when I go back and try to watch it. I always thought ""Men At Work"" was great until the end when it turned into a kind of screwball farce. And what happened to James and Carl after they nailed the bad guy? Did they ever get enough money to fund their dream surf shop? Oh well...As far as this dvd, I was rather distraught over the price- $25!!! I had bought this movie a long time ago and don't remember how much I paid but it could not have been that much. Then I made the mistake of lending it to some jerk who lost it leaving me to have to replace it here now. There are also zero special features contained on it. It looks like Emilio could at least have provided us his fans with something! The soundtrack is good too. So if you are reading this then my guess is you are just a fan of the movie already. I'm not sure what people are supposed to get out of these reviews except maybe whether or not the dvd is worth buying. If you liked the movie and can watch your favorite ones over and over then buy this one.
