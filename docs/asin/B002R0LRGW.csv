I can't really find an easy way to sumarize the lot without giving too much away so I'm just gonna tell what made this show so awesome!The characters are for one thing really likable and enjoyable. Ladd is definately one of the best villians in anime. Even when this guys doing something f***ed up audiances can't help but love him^^ Another character I really loved was Veno. Veno is just awesome! I think hes one of the only peaple who isn't immortal yet he kicks so much a** as the Rail Chaser. The main villian is the only one I didn't like (the old dude for obvious reasons), but thats a good think because it made his death so much more satisfying. Even lesser characters like Merium and Issac were just memorable. Those two goofballs are my favorite comic relief characters in any anime.The main story involves events and peaple on a train whos stories intertwined. There are also 2 or 3 ovas that come after the last episodes of the anime that are really interesting too. They take place after the main story involving the Flying Pussyfoot (yes thats the name of the train). I must warn peaple that the stories switch between past and present so you have to really pay attention to know when and where events happen.I hear alot of peaple say Japenese dubs are better than English. With Baccano that is false. Baccano is one of those shows you have to watch in English because the English voices and acting actually suit the characters more and have so much more life to it. This does take place during the Great depression (1928-1932 in the show) in America after all. Funimation really put alot of effort in voice acting for this one and it shows.I can't think of a thing I hated about this show! Just like Monster I watched this on a website and I must say this is one of thos shows I'm gonna end up buying to watch again. The story is compelling, characters are memorable, the animation is top notch, and its the right amount of episodes long. There was never a moment where I was bored which rarely happens in anime. Baccano! is extremely underrated. Its overshadowed by the mainstream anime like Bleach and Naruto. I recommend any who watches this tell friends and other anime lovers about it.

I love both the DUB and the SUB.It has all kinds of different characters, and develops them all in a comedic, yet serious sort of way. Full of contradictions, this anime is something that will be enjoyed, guaranteed with a great deal of dark humor.It combines the weirdest assortment of plots: mob, alchemy, immortality, robbers, and romance into a truly unique show.

This anime isn't the typical as it is based in the 1930's, however they pulled it off so well. All of the characters are unique in their own right and they mesh well together. The actual animation is very good and I love the excessive gore! I hate animes where gore is implied or the camera shys away just as you should see a great gory death, however this series has plenty of graphic trauma. This series also doesn't have a &#34;main character&#34; which makes for a very interesting storyline as it will show the same timeframe from many different viewpoints.

Sumpter ""CanesGalactica""","[1, 1]","I was pleasantly surprised when I sat down to watch this and found myself engrossed in a story that I must confess, at first made no real sense.Baccano! is one of those animes that has almost everything a person could like:- Violence in the form of intense mob action and a scary ghost story turned real- Romance among some very odd characters- Unusual yet likeable characters- Humor- A great story- Some supernatural happenings- A train robbery (of sorts)- Chaos- Secret societies- Change of scenery- Guns- Action.. lots and lots of action.Most of the characters are entirely mesmerizing be they villains or the 'less than bad' guys. The animation style is really great compared to a lot of animes coming out these days and as I mentioned, the story is fantastic, even if you really have to pay attention (not something you can watch as background noise the first go around) to it to catch what is going on.There was just so much going for this as a show that it really made me sad that it was only 16 episodes long.Sadly, there are no magical girls or mechs in this show, but I think most people will forgive it of that trespass once they sit down to watch it.",5,I Wish This Were More Than Sixteen Episodes!,1336521600,"05 9, 2012",2012,1162,"['was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'when', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'found', 'engrossed', 'story', 'must', 'confess', 'first', 'made', 'real', 'sense.Baccano', 'one', 'animes', 'almost', 'everything', 'person', 'could', 'like', 'Violence', 'form', 'intense', 'mob', 'action', 'scary', 'ghost', 'story', 'turned', 'real-', 'Romance', 'very', 'odd', 'characters-', 'Unusual', 'yet', 'likeable', 'characters-', 'Humor-', 'A', 'great', 'story-', 'supernatural', 'happenings-', 'train', 'robbery', 'sorts', 'Chaos-', 'Secret', 'societies-', 'Change', 'scenery-', 'Guns-', 'Action..', 'lots', 'lots', 'action.Most', 'characters', 'are', 'entirely', 'mesmerizing', 'be', 'villains', ""'less"", 'bad', 'guys', 'animation', 'style', 'really', 'great', 'compared', 'lot', 'animes', 'coming', 'days', 'mentioned', 'story', 'fantastic', 'even', 'really', 'have', 'pay', 'attention', 'not', 'something', 'can', 'watch', 'background', 'first', 'go', 'around', 'catch', 'what', 'going', 'on.There', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'show', 'really', 'made', 'sad', 'was', 'only', '16', 'episodes', 'long.Sadly', 'are', 'magical', 'girls', 'mechs', 'show', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'forgive', 'trespass', 'once', 'sit', 'down', 'watch']",N/A
1284931,A3PEN0MCANLUOK,B002R0LRGW,Coulter Rail,"[0, 0]","Baccono is a rarity in anime: a smartly crafted nonlinear story that's driven by some of the best original characters. There are charming mobsters, sinister alchemists, morbid assassins, and a motley crew of refreshingly comedic and oddly deep disenfranchised riffraff from the streets of 1920's America. Impressive animation, impeccable storytelling, and fresh characters make this a series not to overlook.***PROS***STORYAnime has an obsession with nonlinear storytelling and detached narratives. Most shows suffer from this approach, their otherwise great concepts falling victim to failed attempts at this style. Baccano is the exception. The story jumps between characters and events spanning three years (in the case of some flashbacks, hundreds of years--but touching more on that would venture into SPOILER territory). A train, the Flying Pussy Foot, serves as the altar where all the characters' stories intersect, their various ambitions and goals tested against one another. Being trapped on a train with all of these colorful individuals is a tantalizing rush. There is also a resolution to this story. I only bring this up because so many animes out there are merely a snapshot of the manga or forget to include a resolution altogether, creating archives of half-told stories that, unless done well (Berserk/Elfen Lied), are maddening for the viewer. Baccano has a conclusion.ANIMATIONReminiscent of FMA: Brotherhood in style, character design, and fluidity, the animation is gorgeous and free of gimmicks and lazy shortcuts. The battles range from technically dazzling choreography to downright brutal clashes. This show can play rough and when it does, it's powerful to behold.VOICE ACTINGThe English dub serves this show well, as several of the characters are Italian mobsters and American street hoods. The characters are original and vibrant, and the casting reflects their individuality.***CONS***PACINGSome parts of the show drag and it hurts an otherwise thrilling series. I fear that the occasional disjointed storytelling and slow execution will bore viewers in the beginning and deter them from watching further or paying attention to crucial pieces of evidence that don't pay off until later. However, this is only a minor concern for viewers with shorter attention spans.Baccano is an achievement in storytelling and execution, a tale everyone should sit through at least once. With so many failed attempts at Pulp Fiction-style anime out there, it's important to see one succeed.I'm a writer and animator, so I'm constantly pouring through stacks of anime looking for gems and inspiration.

1284932,A1AVDVX5NQ1JKK,B002R0LRGW,emerson doner,"[7, 18]","An interesting anime, certainly worth a watch.The story is quite captivating and had me enthralled while watching it, but there were some issues. My first issue was that the timeline is a little hard to follow. They tend to jump around quite a bit following each characters actions during three possibly four events (like I said hard to follow.) It is a great concept but it could have been executed a little better.The next problem that I had was that the characters are a little... extreme. Certain characters that seem to be the main characters through out are a bit over the top. Whether it is being very whiny by crying almost all the time (something that got quite obnoxious), very psychotic and (multiple characters fit this bill), extremely stoic and submissive, idiotic to the point of possibly mentally handicapped, or loyal to the point of giving up ones voice. It seemed that the writers' favorite characters were the ones trying to overcome or embracing their extreme personalities, unfortunate the extreme tended to take away from the characters themselves. This being said there were several characters that were well written and I would have liked to have seen them take a more center stage role.This leads me into the next problem. There are too many characters. When there are more than 8 main characters each doing their own thing and sometimes an entire episode where you don't see them you can forget about them and what they were doing. This in combination with the not quite chronologic time line does make it quite confusing at times.The last thing which is only a minor thing is that when I saw the preview I thought this would be a more serious and dark anime. And while it has its moments there are certain characters that in their extreme nature tend to take away from this. So you end up with a forced goofy feeling throughout. It seemed that they were trying to mimic trigun or bebop with certain very goofy or silly moments but it just did not seem to fit with the story. There was also a scene towards the end with dominoes that just seemed... out of place. I think this could have been a better anime if they had just stuck with a dark or serious tone throughout.All this being said the animation was great and the story was fun. It is certainly worth a watch and is worth owning but I would not pay more than $15 or $20 for it. I am looking forward to lending it to certain friends that I know will love it. And I will probably watch it three maybe four more times, but I would be fine with not watching it again. It is worth a watch for any anime enthusiast though and is a great way to kill some time. I would give it 3.5 stars if I could. So at least check it out at some point.",3,"a good watch, but to own....",1295568000,"01 21, 2011",2011,2715,"['interesting', 'anime', 'certainly', 'watch.The', 'story', 'quite', 'captivating', 'had', 'enthralled', 'watching', 'were', 'issues', 'first', 'issue', 'was', 'timeline', 'little', 'hard', 'follow', 'tend', 'jump', 'around', 'quite', 'bit', 'following', 'characters', 'actions', 'three', 'possibly', 'four', 'events', 'said', 'hard', 'follow', 'great', 'concept', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'executed', 'little', 'better.The', 'next', 'problem', 'had', 'was', 'characters', 'are', 'little', 'extreme', 'Certain', 'characters', 'seem', 'be', 'main', 'characters', 'out', 'are', 'bit', 'top', 'being', 'very', 'whiny', 'crying', 'almost', 'time', 'something', 'got', 'quite', 'obnoxious', 'very', 'psychotic', 'multiple', 'characters', 'fit', 'bill', 'extremely', 'stoic', 'submissive', 'idiotic', 'point', 'possibly', 'mentally', 'handicapped', 'loyal', 'point', 'giving', 'up', 'ones', 'voice', 'seemed', 'writers', 'favorite', 'characters', 'were', 'ones', 'trying', 'overcome', 'embracing', 'extreme', 'personalities', 'unfortunate', 'extreme', 'tended', 'take', 'away', 'characters', 'being', 'said', 'were', 'several', 'characters', 'were', 'well', 'written', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'take', 'more', 'center', 'stage', 'role.This', 'next', 'problem', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'When', 'are', 'more', '8', 'main', 'characters', 'doing', 'own', 'thing', 'sometimes', 'entire', 'episode', 'where', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'can', 'forget', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'combination', 'not', 'quite', 'chronologic', 'time', 'line', 'make', 'quite', 'confusing', 'times.The', 'last', 'thing', 'only', 'minor', 'thing', 'when', 'saw', 'preview', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'serious', 'dark', 'anime', 'moments', 'are', 'certain', 'characters', 'extreme', 'nature', 'tend', 'take', 'away', 'end', 'up', 'forced', 'goofy', 'feeling', 'seemed', 'were', 'trying', 'mimic', 'trigun', 'bebop', 'certain', 'very', 'goofy', 'silly', 'moments', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'fit', 'story', 'was', 'also', 'scene', 'end', 'dominoes', 'just', 'seemed', 'place', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'anime', 'had', 'just', 'stuck', 'dark', 'serious', 'tone', 'throughout.All', 'being', 'said', 'animation', 'was', 'great', 'story', 'was', 'fun', 'certainly', 'worth', 'watch', 'worth', 'owning', 'would', 'not', 'pay', 'more', '15', '20', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'lending', 'certain', 'friends', 'know', 'will', 'love', 'will', 'probably', 'watch', 'three', 'maybe', 'four', 'more', 'times', 'would', 'be', 'fine', 'not', 'watching', 'again', 'watch', 'anime', 'enthusiast', 'great', 'way', 'kill', 'time', 'would', 'give', '3.5', 'stars', 'could', 'So', 'least', 'check', 'out', 'point']",N/A
1284933,A1X01SYFP2EN1W,B002R0LRGW,"Evan W. Jenkins ""AuspexAO""","[8, 8]","There's no avoiding or denying it: ""Bacanno!"" is at times a complete bloodbath. Characters literally drenched in blood, bursting heads, and fingers being chopped off are common fare. You would think this would create a sense of...foreboding, disgust maybe? Nope! ""Baccano!"" is above all a love letter written to life itself. Every character has something or someone they love despite having massive psychological issues. You have the (suprisingly touching) wedding plans between two murderous assassins, a sadistic beau who one day hopes to kill his lady love, and the amazing comic duo of Isaac and Myria who serve as the beating heart of this masterpiece.After the joyous and mood-setting opening title, the style of storytelling that awaits you can be confusing upon initial viewing. Most viewers will get the hang of the changing time periods and settle into the show, but those who never quite get it will completely understand on their second viewing. Think of the plot presented here as three chapters of an enormous, endless story. It's not ""incomplete"" in any sense. In fact, the style of the story only adds to the feeling that ""Baccano!"" is a story about the joys of life, both endless and finite.I know I promised you'd feel good, and you will. ""Bacanno!"" is filled with a wild energy. At it's most absurd moments (like when you get to follow Isaac and Myria on their ridiculous capers) it's refreshing and almost innocent in its presentation. Obviously real-life mobsters were never this good-natured and warm, but even when these fictional gangsters take to gunning down their foes, the mood stays pretty light. The main villian, unsurprisingly, is truly despicable (he has to be to make the mobsters look like good guys) and is the show's sole source of unease.I could go on about this excellent series forever, but the more I say, the less you will get to experience first-hand. Go ahead and pick up ""Baccano!"" right away. It will not disappoint.As a side note: Baccano! is blessed with two excellent audio tracks. The English voice work is quite spectacular.

1284937,A182VTJIIEVM37,B002R0LRGW,GintaxAlvissforever,"[1, 2]","This by far is one of the greatest anime series ever made. Narita is a genius when he crafted Baccano. It's a shame Japan didn't appreciate the series because this is a series that has everyone one would need. A great story, many lovable characters, violence and gore, competent woman (since there will always be that complaint about how some characters are useless unless they fight) and just by far the best series.I'm fangirling over the series because it's so brilliant. Narita really did research during the time of the Great Depression as many Japanese writers tend to get a lot of things wrong during this timeline.The plot is all over the place and that's why it's great. While the novel actually goes in order starting from 1930 and going to 1931 and 1932 hopping back into the 1700s and 2000s time period just to get a glimpse of the past and future of the characters. There is no main character or rather the main character depends solely on the arc (like I would argue that Firo is the main character of 1930 and the narrators even lampshade this). The plot in the anime jumps over the place and it takes a few episodes or even a few runs of the entire show to understand what's going on at this time. Like the first episode begins at the end of the anime and then starts over explaining how the events occurred constantly jumping back because in honestly, if the series didn't jump back, then you would get bored at some points (1932 arc is incredibly weak given it lacks any action sequence on Eve's end but then it almost always jumps back to 1931 with the Flying Pussyfoot train battle which is beloved by everyone who watches the anime).Because the plot is different depending on the arc, its hard to keep track with only Isaac and Miria being the only people connecting the plot and characters together (as one episode title specifically states).Of course, you'll fall in love with the 1931 arc. This arc has the most action, some of the goriest scenes in anime history (rivaling Higurashi, Umineko, Elfen Lied amongst others) and the biggest badass characters ever. Just watch the series.

On the minus side, the characters tend to be over-the-top to the point of absurd and unbelievable, the story tend to rely a bit too much on blood instead of brains, and worst of all it's told in a ""nonlinear"" fashion, dancing back and forth out of story sequence.Now I can't say there's anything inherently wrong with nonlinear storytelling, but I can say that it has to be able to answer the question:  WHY BOTHER?  If there's no apparent rationale for it, all it amounts to is jerking the audience around.  In the end, after the plot of BACCANO! becomes apparent, it's obvious there's not that much going on, and the nonlinear storytelling just seems like a pretentious gimmick -- working at being incoherent and confusing in hopes of convincing the audience it's clever.There's also, as noted elsewhere, too many characters that aren't fleshed out at all, but I chalk that up from trying to compress the novels from which this anime series was derived into a video format, and so I can cut BACCANO! some slack on that score.

""Baccano!"" is this type of series.This anime about mobsters mashes together alchemy, gang wars and gunfights in a dark, action-packed series that will satisfy anyone thirsty for incomprehensibly blood-drenched fights.In fact, the narrators in episode one puzzle themselves over which character takes the leading role. The truth is that all the characters stand on their own, since all of them suffer from the same curse of immortality. Nearly 300 years ago, a group of people aboard the Advenna Avis ship attained these powers from a priest.Centuries later, in New York in the 1930s, these immortal people are still alive, with dreams of living and dying, killing before they get killed. Each group is defined by their unique charm and brutal fighting style. However, they each have different desires for love, marriage and sadism.All the stories culminate in an outstanding mish mash of cast members who stand out for their courage and their sense of humor. The two comedians, Isaac and Milly, humor their friends with their jokes and eccentricities. The crybaby Jacuzzi Splot gains self-confidence by defending his girlfriend against a monster on a train. Firo Prochainezo risks his life to protect a young woman subjected as the slave of someone else.Conflicts of pain litter the series as well. A boy named Czeslaw Meyer wishes to defend himself by killing everyone who tries to torture him. The girl Eva Geonard wishes to find her lost big brother, who is presumably dead. A mute woman named Chane Laforet wants to escape from her father's plot to hold all the people in a train hostage.The anime is filled with countless numbers of uplifting stories, despite the brutal, shocking violence.

There are no main characters, anyone can be the main character.So with that the show has 3 stories going on at the same time, they are occurring in 1930, 1931, 1932, also they are told non-linear style so at one point you will be in 1932 and then jump back to 1930 then to 1931 and so forth. If the non-linear style worries you the series ""confusing"" points wear off and the story comes together very easily. Also this style makes it worth watching multiple times. The series takes place in US going from Chicago to New YorkThis English dub is probably in the top 5 of dubs for animes in on my list. It works because this anime takes place in the US. Also important to note that the Japanese audio works great and if I have one complaint about the English dub is that 2 of the characters where funnier in Japanese than in English. But that doesn't mean the English dub was bad for them. This is just my personal opinion.If you love mafia gangsters, immortals, romance, humor, action, or supernatural then this series has something for you.This series is a lesson in storytelling and character development which hasn't been done so well in a long time let alone a 16 episode series.

It's kind of hard to give a real detail background on the whole story all I can suggest is read the Amazon editorial and check some episodes online to see for yourself.  The cast for the subbed and dubbed did their character roles very well bringing out the emotional dramatic situations you see in the scenes very well,  also the soundtrack was a very nice touch to the series fitting it to a T.  Getting the series for under $30.00 dollars was a no brainer though.  At first I thought the ending was a little open ended then someone brought up that the series actually ends at around EP13  the last three as another reviewer wrote appear to be like OVA's showing us some of the other characters around the 1930's and their stories at that time.  So for the price of this series and the entertainment you'll get from it this one is a definite must,  but if you don't like gory or to bloody animes then this this one won't be for you as it has a lot of both in the series...Update 08-22-2011Just a small update on the series,  a friend of mine said he got a little confused on the timeline of the series because you would see some episodes or scenes where the new immortals weren't immortal yet or where they would meet a friend but yet in another scene they wouldn't even know them.  Just remember when you watch the episodes you'll see a flash of the year the scenes are playing,  meaning they show a few minutes of what happened in 1930 and then ten minutes into the episode they'll show what's happening in the year 1931 or 1932 or even in the 1700's.  They do this to give us enough of a  storyline for all the characters that are shown in the series and what their stories are,  it does get a bit confusing if you don't keep an eye out on the year the scenes are showing though so I can understand some peoples confusing when they watch the series and aren't on the lookout for the year the episodes is playing...",5,"Incredibly Violent,  Bloody,  And Entertaining As H#@!",1313884800,"08 21, 2011",2011,2213,"['Incredibly', 'entertaining', 'bloody', 'entertaining', 'various', 'characters', 'series', 'own', 'situations', 'seemingly', 'psychotic', 'stories.The', 'series', 'will', 'give', 'feel', 'anime', 'fan', 'different', 'genres', 'enjoyment', 'series', 'wide', 'array', 'show', 'kind', 'hard', 'give', 'real', 'detail', 'background', 'whole', 'story', 'can', 'suggest', 'read', 'Amazon', 'editorial', 'check', 'episodes', 'online', 'see', 'cast', 'subbed', 'dubbed', 'did', 'character', 'roles', 'very', 'well', 'bringing', 'out', 'emotional', 'dramatic', 'situations', 'see', 'scenes', 'very', 'well', 'also', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'very', 'nice', 'touch', 'series', 'fitting', 'T.', 'Getting', 'series', '30.00', 'dollars', 'was', 'brainer', 'first', 'thought', 'ending', 'was', 'little', 'open', 'ended', 'then', 'someone', 'brought', 'up', 'series', 'actually', 'EP13', 'last', 'three', 'reviewer', 'wrote', 'appear', 'be', 'OVA', 'showing', 'other', 'characters', '1930', 'stories', 'time', 'So', 'price', 'series', 'entertainment', ""'ll"", 'get', 'one', 'definite', 'must', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'gory', 'bloody', 'animes', 'then', 'one', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'lot', 'series', 'Update', '08-22-2011Just', 'small', 'update', 'series', 'friend', 'mine', 'said', 'got', 'little', 'confused', 'timeline', 'series', 'would', 'see', 'episodes', 'scenes', 'where', 'new', 'immortals', 'were', ""n't"", 'immortal', 'yet', 'where', 'would', 'meet', 'friend', 'yet', 'scene', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'Just', 'remember', 'when', 'watch', 'episodes', ""'ll"", 'see', 'flash', 'year', 'scenes', 'are', 'playing', 'meaning', 'show', 'few', 'minutes', 'what', 'happened', '1930', 'then', 'ten', 'minutes', 'episode', ""'ll"", 'show', 'what', 'happening', 'year', '1931', '1932', 'even', '1700', 'do', 'give', 'enough', 'storyline', 'characters', 'are', 'shown', 'series', 'what', 'stories', 'are', 'get', 'bit', 'confusing', 'do', ""n't"", 'keep', 'eye', 'out', 'year', 'scenes', 'are', 'showing', 'can', 'understand', 'peoples', 'confusing', 'when', 'watch', 'series', 'are', ""n't"", 'lookout', 'year', 'episodes', 'playing']",N/A
1284950,A94NOJCJCI6PB,B002R0LRGW,Sean,"[0, 0]","When searching out anime with violence and decent plots I stumbled upon Baccano, what has to be one of the most original concepts in anime. Set in 1930's America on the train the Flying Pussyfoot (Hardy-har-har) it is replete with awesome characters, great dialogue, a neat plot, and a neat way of telling the story that doesn't actually confuse as much as it should. The series ability to portray so many varied characters, give us a compelling plot, and have absolutely no part that makes me cringe or groan, makes this a true staple for all anime fans.The story jumps around a lot, but it doesn't take a lot of brain power to understand the plot despite this jumping. There are about fifteen characters that are focused on to some degree and each one somehow has backstory and somehow comes across as different from the next due to the excellent writing. The story centers around the Immortals, a group of people who made a pact with some sort of devilish entity to have eternal lives. This is while they are onboard a ship, presumably heading to the New World during the 1700's. The story moves to the 1930's and focuses mainly on a train ride that goes nuts. There are mafia on board, there are assassins, there are immortals. It's a hell of a set up and makes for some awesome action. The idea of an anime centered around this time period in America is pretty fresh, and it is completely different from a lot of the typical anime fare. This is, of course, based off of a light novel series. The ideas are just so cool though and you want to see this keep going and going as the plot comes to a satisfying conclusion, but there is so much more that could be told.The story is just fantastic and one of the main reasons to stay onboard (I made a joke!) for the whole series, including the OVA's. The show is relatively short at sixteen episodes, but it delivers with more story than a hundred episodes of Naruto can provide, and more compelling characters than pretty much every cookie cutter shounen out there. And with so many stories to watch play out, it's hard not to find one that interests you.Quality animation, that's for sure. The character models all look good and the backgrounds look especially good. New York, Chicago, and the train all have an old timey feel that really helps create a mood and ambiance. Not that the thirties feel is pitch perfect, but I don't completely expect it to be. It still has a lot of good detail. Fluid fight scenes also help the score.When talking about awesome anime intros, Bacanno's can be right at the top of the list. An awesome opening song along with a great intro animation makes you just want to watch it more. The ending song is meh. The music during the show is awesome once again and really fits with the time period. The voice actors are all good and the sound effects are good as well. No complaints here.Isaac and Miria are the stand-out characters, though Ladd Russo is also pretty spectacular. All the other characters are great, but some just stand out above others. Every character is connected, though you don't see this sometimes until later on so at first it feels like the Tad Williams Otherworld series. The characters don't all seem to be connected, but as it progresses we see the connection. None of the characters are really emotionally attachable, none are seen for a long enough portion for you to care that much, but they each have great back story and some will draw you in more than others. You get to choose between young lovers, idiot thieves, mafia, insane killers, torturers. All kinds of good people. They add copious amounts of humor, violence, depravity, and awesome to the series.This is not a perfect anime, as I may be sounding like it is. Chicago apparently has a lot of signs in Japanese, American books are apparently read Japanese style (backwards), and Times Squares biggest sign apparently advertises cup noodles. I digress though. It's a great anime, but I will state that it will appeal to a certain crowd over others. Some may not like the setting nor the plot which can be a bit convoluted at times. It's A-OK. Reviews are opinions of the author, not opinions of everyone as a consensus. But this does have a lot of excellent qualities to it. There's a lot of gore, a lot of violence, and a lot of fun characters to stick out the series with. I can't really complain about a lot because it appeals to me greatly.Baccano is a 9/10.",5,Awesome,1372204800,"06 26, 2013",2013,4431,"['When', 'searching', 'out', 'anime', 'violence', 'decent', 'plots', 'stumbled', 'upon', 'Baccano', 'what', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'original', 'concepts', 'anime', 'Set', '1930', 'America', 'train', 'Flying', 'Pussyfoot', 'Hardy-har-har', 'replete', 'awesome', 'characters', 'great', 'dialogue', 'neat', 'plot', 'neat', 'way', 'telling', 'story', ""n't"", 'actually', 'confuse', 'as', 'much', 'should', 'series', 'ability', 'portray', 'so', 'many', 'varied', 'characters', 'give', 'compelling', 'plot', 'have', 'absolutely', 'part', 'cringe', 'groan', 'true', 'staple', 'anime', 'fans.The', 'story', 'jumps', 'lot', ""n't"", 'take', 'lot', 'brain', 'power', 'understand', 'plot', 'jumping', 'are', 'fifteen', 'characters', 'are', 'focused', 'degree', 'one', 'somehow', 'backstory', 'somehow', 'across', 'different', 'next', 'due', 'excellent', 'writing', 'story', 'centers', 'Immortals', 'group', 'people', 'who', 'made', 'pact', 'sort', 'devilish', 'entity', 'have', 'eternal', 'lives', 'are', 'onboard', 'ship', 'presumably', 'heading', 'New', 'World', '1700', 'story', '1930', 'mainly', 'train', 'ride', 'nuts', 'are', 'mafia', 'board', 'are', 'assassins', 'are', 'immortals', 'hell', 'set', 'up', 'awesome', 'action', 'idea', 'anime', 'centered', 'time', 'period', 'America', 'pretty', 'fresh', 'completely', 'different', 'lot', 'typical', 'anime', 'fare', 'course', 'based', 'light', 'novel', 'series', 'ideas', 'are', 'just', 'so', 'cool', 'want', 'see', 'keep', 'going', 'going', 'plot', 'satisfying', 'conclusion', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'could', 'be', 'told.The', 'story', 'just', 'fantastic', 'one', 'main', 'reasons', 'stay', 'onboard', 'made', 'joke', 'whole', 'series', 'including', 'OVA', 'show', 'relatively', 'short', 'sixteen', 'episodes', 'more', 'story', 'hundred', 'episodes', 'Naruto', 'can', 'provide', 'more', 'compelling', 'characters', 'pretty', 'much', 'cookie', 'cutter', 'shounen', 'out', 'there', 'so', 'many', 'stories', 'watch', 'play', 'hard', 'not', 'find', 'one', 'interests', 'you.Quality', 'animation', 'sure', 'character', 'models', 'look', 'good', 'backgrounds', 'look', 'especially', 'good', 'New', 'York', 'Chicago', 'train', 'have', 'old', 'timey', 'feel', 'really', 'create', 'mood', 'ambiance', 'Not', 'thirties', 'feel', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'do', ""n't"", 'completely', 'expect', 'be', 'still', 'lot', 'good', 'detail', 'Fluid', 'fight', 'scenes', 'also', 'help', 'score.When', 'talking', 'awesome', 'anime', 'intros', 'Bacanno', 'can', 'be', 'right', 'top', 'list', 'awesome', 'opening', 'song', 'great', 'intro', 'animation', 'just', 'want', 'watch', 'more', 'ending', 'song', 'meh', 'music', 'show', 'awesome', 'once', 'again', 'really', 'fits', 'time', 'period', 'voice', 'actors', 'are', 'good', 'sound', 'effects', 'are', 'good', 'well', 'No', 'complaints', 'here.Isaac', 'Miria', 'are', 'stand-out', 'characters', 'Ladd', 'Russo', 'also', 'pretty', 'spectacular', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'great', 'just', 'stand', 'out', 'others', 'character', 'connected', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'sometimes', 'later', 'so', 'first', 'Tad', 'Williams', 'Otherworld', 'series', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'all', 'seem', 'be', 'connected', 'see', 'connection', 'None', 'characters', 'are', 'really', 'emotionally', 'attachable', 'none', 'are', 'seen', 'long', 'enough', 'portion', 'care', 'much', 'have', 'great', 'back', 'story', 'will', 'draw', 'more', 'others', 'get', 'choose', 'young', 'lovers', 'idiot', 'thieves', 'mafia', 'insane', 'killers', 'torturers', 'kinds', 'good', 'people', 'add', 'copious', 'amounts', 'humor', 'violence', 'depravity', 'awesome', 'series.This', 'not', 'perfect', 'anime', 'may', 'be', 'sounding', 'Chicago', 'apparently', 'lot', 'signs', 'Japanese', 'American', 'books', 'are', 'apparently', 'read', 'Japanese', 'style', 'backwards', 'Times', 'Squares', 'biggest', 'sign', 'apparently', 'cup', 'noodles', 'digress', 'great', 'anime', 'will', 'state', 'will', 'appeal', 'certain', 'crowd', 'others', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'setting', 'plot', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'convoluted', 'times', 'A-OK', 'Reviews', 'are', 'opinions', 'author', 'not', 'opinions', 'everyone', 'consensus', 'have', 'lot', 'excellent', 'qualities', 'lot', 'gore', 'lot', 'violence', 'lot', 'fun', 'characters', 'stick', 'out', 'series', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'complain', 'lot', 'appeals', 'greatly.Baccano', '9/10']",N/A

I'm still left underwhelmed.Let me make this clear; I do not believe Baccano to be a bad series, far from it. I can easily say that it is a very good, even great series. The story is unique and original both in content and execution, the character designs and animation are quite well done, and the English cast is absolutely spectacular, particularly J. Michael Tatum and Caitlin Glass. I understand why so many people love this series.However, my problem with the series is that while watching it, I found it really hard to get interested in what was going on. I knew about the confusing start to the series before going in, but while others have said it starts making complete sense after the first couple episodes, I continued to find myself confused at what was going on, despite giving the show my complete attention and desperately trying to figure out what was happening. I don't know, maybe I'm not as smart as others here. Much as I enjoyed the characters, I never found myself emotionally connecting with them or identifying with them due to how bad of people most of them are. While this made for entertaining storytelling, it came at the expense of holding me at an emotional distance, such that when an episode ended, instead of immediately reaching for the remote to get to the next episode, like I did during  Wolfs Rain and Fullmetal Alchemist to name a couple, I found myself thinking, ""I don't really care about what happens next."" Not the best thing to think about a show that's so short. The lack of an actual ending doesn't bother me, but that final conversation between Carol and the Vice-President, where he basically insults anyone who wants their shows to have an ending, rubbed me the wrong way.In the end, something about Baccano! Just didn't click with me.
