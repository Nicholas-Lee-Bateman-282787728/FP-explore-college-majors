Both were done in a realistic manner to the times.Grease was about hot rods and Grease 2 was about motorycles. It was neat that the principal, assistant principal,coach, and Frenchy were in both movies.Eve Arden was outstanding in both movies and played a part that reminds one of her role in Our Miss Brooks. Sid Ceasar played a humerous coach which gave a lot of laughter.

WALDER ""Paul Walder""","[22, 23]","I already have the United Kingdom DVD's of Grease and Grease 2 but when I saw them as a two-pack I thought I must get them as Grease is a different version than the UK one.Grease is one of my favourite musical films ever which was released in 1978. I love Olivia Newton-John and John Travolta and the love story storyline and of course the fantastic soundtrack including Summer Nights, You're The One That I Want, Sandy and Greased Lightnin'. It brings back so many fantastic memories of my childhood as I was only [...]at the time.Grease 2 was released in 1982 and all though it is not up to the standard of the Grease storyline it is a great movie in it's own right and didn't get the recognition it deserved. Maxwell Caulfield, Michelle Pfeiffer and Adrian Zmed star in this very funny love story. It has a great soundtrack with songs such as Reproduction and We'll Be Together.If you like musical films then Grease and Grease 2 are the ones you should have in your DVD collection.

The music from both easily gets stuck in you head. I doubt either needs a synopsis as they are movie classics to most of us but...:Rydell High is the home to two groups which are home to the coolest kids in school- The T-Birds and the Pink Ladies. In the first movie a summer romance between the leader of the T-Birds and an Australian blonde causes a shift in the subtle flow of the senior class of Rydell. Is it better to be the all American jock to keep Sandy or to stay a member of the T-Birds? is a question he will have to answer. In the second movie 2 years later Sandy's cousin moves here from England and begins his own senior year at Rydell.
