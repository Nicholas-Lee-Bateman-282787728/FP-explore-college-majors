Of course aging is no sin, and of course inevitable, yet seeing and hearing the weak vocals dirge-like tempos and generally lackluster performance underscores the sad reality. There is no spark and no joy in this concert, and the songs, the new ones are feeble. The old warhorses, just, depressing. Trower attempts to breathe some life but ultimately it all falls dreadfully flat.

What are those 2 for anyway?...These guys have always been about subtelty, not bombast! The songs are intended to be minimalist in structure. Can you not see and hear how into it they are??? To say Jack Bruce's vocals are ""weak"" is also bizarre. ""CARMEN"" is amazing vocally!! Who pray-tell would sing this any better?..Jack Bruce is incredible! He is pitch-perfect.  Gary Husband is an amazing drummer and a wonderful choice here.(talk about the details! GREAT IS A DRUMMER WHO CAN DEAL WITH MINIMALISM WHILE MAINTAINING SUCH DYNAMICS!  If you are a Trower, or Jack Bruce fan this is a must!The only reason this gets 4 stars is because I find the guitar a bit low/dry/ & subdued in the mix.  It's unusually clean and may be just the way the DVD/performance was recorded. Usually Trower's guitar is right on the edge of feedback. So, I would liked to have seen the mix a tad more vibrant, louder, especially on the guitar & bass side. Having said that, recording a live performance DVD is tricky thing. There are allot of ""funny things"" going on in the post- production stage of supposedly live DVD's these days, and this one, while being a bit ""dry"",  is refreshingly true to the performance. Nice camera work and angles. Good lighting as well!Unfortunately, there are no ""extras"" on this dvd which is a shame. Would love to have seen some interviews! So 4 stars for lack of extras.. and a bit too dry mix-wise. The performances are killer! 5 STARS FOR PERFORMANCE!How can anyone not be happy to have this? Trower never was a big commercial success and to have a DVD with Jack Bruce at all is a total gift! I have seen Trower recently and to say he is somehow getting worse with age is completely inaccurate and unfair to the truth. Like Beck, Trower is one of the very few who is getting better , not worse with age!  What a shame to kick ofF this great product availablilty with such a lame and inaccurate review!""It's all in the details"" and unfortunately for some, they are not equipped to see or hear them.",4,"Yeah age does matter, like Beck, Trower has gotten better with age!",1255564800,"10 15, 2009",2009,2088,"['ALERT', 'previous', 'review', 'just', 'absurd', '2', 'stars', 'Why', 'bother', 'giving', 'two', 'What', 'are', '2', 'anyway', 'guys', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'subtelty', 'not', 'bombast', 'songs', 'are', 'intended', 'be', 'minimalist', 'structure', 'Can', 'not', 'see', 'hear', 'how', 'are', 'say', 'Jack', 'Bruce', 'vocals', 'are', 'weak', 'also', 'bizarre', 'CARMEN', 'amazing', 'vocally', 'Who', 'pray-tell', 'would', 'sing', 'better', '..Jack', 'Bruce', 'incredible', 'pitch-perfect', 'Gary', 'Husband', 'amazing', 'drummer', 'wonderful', 'choice', 'here', 'talk', 'details', 'GREAT', 'A', 'DRUMMER', 'WHO', 'CAN', 'DEAL', 'WITH', 'MINIMALISM', 'WHILE', 'MAINTAINING', 'SUCH', 'DYNAMICS', 'are', 'Trower', 'Jack', 'Bruce', 'fan', 'must', 'only', 'reason', '4', 'stars', 'find', 'guitar', 'bit', 'low/dry/', 'subdued', 'mix', 'unusually', 'clean', 'may', 'be', 'just', 'way', 'DVD/performance', 'was', 'recorded', 'Usually', 'Trower', 'guitar', 'right', 'edge', 'feedback', 'So', 'would', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'mix', 'tad', 'more', 'vibrant', 'louder', 'especially', 'guitar', 'bass', 'side', 'Having', 'said', 'recording', 'live', 'performance', 'DVD', 'tricky', 'thing', 'are', 'allot', 'funny', 'things', 'going', 'post-', 'production', 'stage', 'supposedly', 'live', 'DVD', 'days', 'one', 'being', 'bit', 'dry', 'refreshingly', 'true', 'performance', 'Nice', 'camera', 'work', 'angles', 'Good', 'lighting', 'well', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'extras', 'dvd', 'shame', 'Would', 'love', 'have', 'seen', 'interviews', 'So', '4', 'stars', 'lack', 'extras..', 'bit', 'too', 'dry', 'mix-wise', 'performances', 'are', 'killer', '5', 'STARS', 'FOR', 'PERFORMANCE', 'How', 'can', 'anyone', 'not', 'be', 'happy', 'have', 'Trower', 'never', 'was', 'big', 'commercial', 'success', 'have', 'DVD', 'Jack', 'Bruce', 'total', 'gift', 'have', 'seen', 'Trower', 'recently', 'say', 'somehow', 'getting', 'worse', 'age', 'completely', 'inaccurate', 'unfair', 'truth', 'Beck', 'Trower', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'who', 'getting', 'better', 'not', 'worse', 'age', 'What', 'shame', 'kick', 'ofF', 'great', 'product', 'availablilty', 'lame', 'inaccurate', 'review', 'details', 'unfortunately', 'are', 'not', 'equipped', 'see', 'hear']",N/A
1268393,A1ODZ7SDUPEGNK,B002GYS2JY,"Kurt Harding ""bon vivant""","[3, 3]","Even though I already owned the studio CD of Seven Moons since its release a couple of years ago, I was delighted to hear that a live performance of the album was being released on DVD. So I ordered it as soon as I got word it was available. What's the verdict? Its a solid performance...On this DVD, ten songs from the album, three Cream songs, and one other are presented. And while Jack Bruce doesn't sound exactly as he did in his days with Cream, he hasn't strayed far. As for Robin Trower, well he is just superb. One of the joys of seeing Trower live is the amusement one gets from watching his facial contortions while he plays. Backing Trower and Bruce is the steady, skillful drum work of Gary Husband.My favorites on the DVD differ slightly from what I like best on the studio album. They are Seven Moons, Lives of Clay, Distant Places of the Heart, The Last Door, the exquisite Carmen, and two old Cream songs, Sunshine of Your Love and Politician. And while there are no ""extras"", what is here gives the viewer plenty of value for money.Don't pay any attention to the naysayers. If you like Trower and especially if you like Jack Bruce, you are going to enjoy Seven Moons Live.

1268394,AFSBKKDFLZZX5,B002GYS2JY,Mark Anderson,"[6, 6]","This DVD is a live 2009 concert with Jack Bruce, Robin Trower and drummer Gary Husband performing the material on the studio version of Bruce & Trower's Seven Moons CD, along with some material from Jack Bruce's days with Cream.Great stuff. This performance ranks alongside the best material Jack Bruce and Robin Trower have done individually and collectively over the decades.There's nothing fancy about the performance. There are no ostentatious theatrics or staging. This is just three first rate musicians performing some great new material along with covers of Politician and Sunshine of Your Love, both Jack Bruce compositions from his days with Cream.My only criticism of this album is that I would have liked to hear this band cover some of the early Robin Trower classics like Day of the Eagle and Too Rolling Stoned along with the covers of Cream material.But that's a really minor issue.For fans of Cream and of Robin Trower, you won't be disappointed with this DVD.

1268395,A2R1GFS6P1PC18,B002GYS2JY,Peter Baklava,"[22, 22]","Like many, I thought that Robin Trower got back together with Jack Bruce in order to produce a cheap payday capitalizing on past glories.  After all, even the song titles were rip-offs of old stuff, right?Well, I was wrong.  Instead of a jaded, pale imitation of what used to be, like most rockers past their prime produce, this is actually a heartening reminder that talent and true greatness stand the test of time.  I will readily agree that Trower and Bruce are not going to win any beauty contests these days; it's actually kind of heartbreaking to see how they've aged.But, DESPITE the ravages of time, Bruce can still produce jewels like ""Just Another Day"", which is just as good as anything on his masterwork, ""Harmony Row"".  And Robin Trower plays ridiculously well for a sixty-four year old. He plays the Cream classic songs effortlessly, but he really shines on the new stuff like ""Seven Moons"", ""So Far to Yesterday"", and ""The Last Door"".In the final analysis, there aren't that many rock musicians that you can classify as ""significantly creative artists"".  But these are two such musicians, from a generation that lifted rock music toward respectability.Look at the people Bruce has worked with: John McLaughlin, Tony Williams, Eric Clapton, Ginger Baker, Chris Spedding, Gary Moore, Carla Bley, Frank Zappa.  Jack has the kind of musical intelligence that transcends genres.  Trower has the flowing style of soloing that can remind you of a jazz saxophonist, and he is never anything less than tasteful.So my advice is to get past the wrinkles, and enjoy the music.  Jazz player Roland Kirk kept playing after debilitating strokes.  Johnny Cash still commanded respect when he was frail of health.Just be glad that these guys are still around, still creative, still sharing their gifts.  What they're doing, in the face of a music industry that only loves pretty faces, is nothing short of HEROIC.",4,Twilight of the Gods,1258675200,"11 20, 2009",2009,1912,"['many', 'thought', 'Robin', 'Trower', 'got', 'back', 'together', 'Jack', 'Bruce', 'order', 'produce', 'cheap', 'payday', 'capitalizing', 'past', 'glories', 'even', 'song', 'titles', 'were', 'rip-offs', 'old', 'stuff', 'right', 'Well', 'was', 'wrong', 'Instead', 'jaded', 'pale', 'imitation', 'what', 'used', 'be', 'most', 'rockers', 'past', 'prime', 'produce', 'actually', 'heartening', 'reminder', 'talent', 'true', 'greatness', 'stand', 'test', 'time', 'will', 'readily', 'agree', 'Trower', 'Bruce', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'win', 'beauty', 'days', 'actually', 'kind', 'heartbreaking', 'see', 'how', ""'ve"", 'aged.But', 'DESPITE', 'ravages', 'time', 'Bruce', 'can', 'still', 'produce', 'jewels', 'Just', 'Day', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'anything', 'masterwork', 'Harmony', 'Row', 'Robin', 'Trower', 'ridiculously', 'well', 'sixty-four', 'year', 'old', 'Cream', 'classic', 'songs', 'effortlessly', 'really', 'new', 'stuff', 'Seven', 'Moons', 'So', 'Far', 'Yesterday', 'Last', 'Door', 'final', 'analysis', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'rock', 'musicians', 'can', 'classify', 'significantly', 'creative', 'artists', 'are', 'two', 'such', 'musicians', 'generation', 'lifted', 'rock', 'music', 'respectability.Look', 'people', 'Bruce', 'worked', 'John', 'McLaughlin', 'Tony', 'Williams', 'Eric', 'Clapton', 'Ginger', 'Baker', 'Chris', 'Spedding', 'Gary', 'Moore', 'Carla', 'Bley', 'Frank', 'Zappa', 'Jack', 'kind', 'musical', 'intelligence', 'genres', 'Trower', 'flowing', 'style', 'soloing', 'can', 'remind', 'jazz', 'saxophonist', 'never', 'anything', 'less', 'tasteful.So', 'advice', 'get', 'wrinkles', 'enjoy', 'music', 'Jazz', 'player', 'Roland', 'Kirk', 'kept', 'playing', 'debilitating', 'strokes', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'still', 'commanded', 'respect', 'when', 'was', 'frail', 'health.Just', 'be', 'glad', 'guys', 'are', 'still', 'still', 'creative', 'still', 'sharing', 'gifts', 'What', ""'re"", 'doing', 'face', 'music', 'industry', 'only', 'pretty', 'nothing', 'short', 'HEROIC']",N/A

1268397,A2CUIYVJAYI88K,B002GYS2JY,"Richard E. Johnson ""Just another fan""","[8, 11]","I think one of the problems with this DVD is the mix. I've only listened to it in 5.1, but the mix is a little too ""nice"". Instead of having the instruments up loud, the vocal dominates the mix. The issue I have with that is that the bass is mixed way down and as a result it doesn't sound full. I think if the drums, bass and guitar were up with the vocals it would be a lot more enjoyable. As it is it sounds fairly stark. This is sort of surprising since the studio CD was mixed a lot better.Sure Jack Bruce, especially, is showing his age, but what he is playing is good. What Trower is playing is also good. Gary Husband is good, but doesn't seem to be as forceful as needed. Maybe it just wasn't their best night. I was also disappointed by the lack of older Bruce/Trower material; it would have been a lot better than Bruce's Cream hits, which were competantly done, but what's the point.Having said that there's several nice moments on the DVD and if you're a fan of Bruce or Trower there's enough to like to buy this. If you're a casual Trower fan, then the Living Out of Time Live DVD is a better choice.
