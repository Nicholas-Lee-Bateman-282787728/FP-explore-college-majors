Done by his family, I get the sneaky suspicion it was staged to appear live.Everything is close up, you don't see an audience, unless a clip of an audience was slipped in toward the end. The music is ok, but lacks that live feeling.  It is simply song after song, after song; no feeling of connecting with his audience, and certainly no feeling of performing live.Apparently it may have been done with a videocamera, and it sure looks it.  I'm sure the family wants to put out some concert performance of Conway, either for memories or money, but this is done poorly, too distracting to attempt to enjoy Conway.  .....Rizzo",2,Something is missing here,1279238400,"07 16, 2010",2010,778,"['have', 'loved', 'music', 'Conway', 'Twitty', 'especially', 'see', 'perform', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'how', 'unappealing', 'Greatest', 'Live', 'DVD', 'came', 'Done', 'family', 'get', 'sneaky', 'suspicion', 'was', 'staged', 'appear', 'live.Everything', 'close', 'up', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'audience', 'clip', 'audience', 'was', 'slipped', 'end', 'music', 'ok', 'live', 'feeling', 'simply', 'song', 'song', 'song', 'feeling', 'connecting', 'audience', 'certainly', 'feeling', 'performing', 'live.Apparently', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'videocamera', 'sure', ""'m"", 'sure', 'family', 'put', 'out', 'concert', 'performance', 'Conway', 'either', 'memories', 'money', 'done', 'poorly', 'too', 'distracting', 'attempt', 'enjoy', 'Conway', '..Rizzo']",N/A
