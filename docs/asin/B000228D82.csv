His mission makes us think about society and most of all government on how it imposes its will upon us trying to conform our lives into a ""one size fits all"" category.  Right?  Probably not!It really isnt necessary to be exposed to rape, violence, mutilation and defecation to become a stronger person.  That's what GG Allin believed and he had no choice but to believe that because he was a product of his environment.  So instead of worship, I can't help but to feel great pity for his existence.Everybody comes from different backgrounds and he really was just as bad as any government because he was using his shows to impose his will on others as well.Lets all keep in mind that GG Allin was the way he was because of how he was raised & his lack of talent. And I would be that pissed off at the world too if I had as small as the size penis he had.  When I saw that (or barely saw that), I said to myself ""oh that's what this is all about.""GG Allin couldn't fight to save his life.  His environment that he surrounded himself in, was psuedo tough.  Most punk rockers are just that, psuedo tough.Any person with any skill would of destroyed GG Alin within seconds when attacked by him.I am glad he's dead.  The world is a better place without him.  If you any kind of self-esteem, you will realize that the existence of characters like GG Allin isn't really necessary to become a stronger person.  Take initiative and be a stronger person on your own terms.If you want shock value that can be backed up by talent, stick with MIke Patton",1,It's a damn shame,1159660800,"10 1, 2006",2006,1611,"['existence', 'someone', 'GG', 'Allin', 'almost', 'necessary', 'times', 'mission', 'think', 'society', 'most', 'government', 'how', 'will', 'upon', 'trying', 'conform', 'lives', 'one', 'size', 'category', 'Right', 'Probably', 'not', 'really', 'isnt', 'necessary', 'be', 'exposed', 'rape', 'violence', 'mutilation', 'defecation', 'become', 'stronger', 'person', 'what', 'GG', 'Allin', 'believed', 'had', 'choice', 'believe', 'was', 'product', 'environment', 'So', 'instead', 'worship', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'great', 'pity', 'existence.Everybody', 'different', 'backgrounds', 'really', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'bad', 'government', 'was', 'using', 'shows', 'impose', 'will', 'others', 'well.Lets', 'keep', 'mind', 'GG', 'Allin', 'was', 'way', 'was', 'because', 'how', 'was', 'raised', 'lack', 'talent', 'would', 'be', 'pissed', 'off', 'world', 'too', 'had', 'as', 'small', 'size', 'penis', 'had', 'When', 'saw', 'barely', 'saw', 'said', 'myself', 'what', 'GG', 'Allin', 'could', ""n't"", 'fight', 'save', 'life', 'environment', 'surrounded', 'was', 'psuedo', 'tough', 'Most', 'punk', 'rockers', 'are', 'just', 'psuedo', 'tough.Any', 'person', 'skill', 'would', 'destroyed', 'GG', 'Alin', 'seconds', 'when', 'attacked', 'him.I', 'am', 'glad', 'dead', 'world', 'better', 'place', 'kind', 'self-esteem', 'will', 'realize', 'existence', 'characters', 'GG', 'Allin', ""n't"", 'really', 'necessary', 'become', 'stronger', 'person', 'Take', 'initiative', 'be', 'stronger', 'person', 'own', 'terms.If', 'want', 'shock', 'value', 'can', 'be', 'backed', 'up', 'talent', 'stick', 'MIke', 'Patton']",N/A

821383,A1EM1PEMH6OYDU,B000228D82,"J. Cook ""Scabboy""","[11, 14]","Even if you are not a GG Allin fan I reccomend this. GG Allin was a dirty, no good, sadistic, dirty, sexual junkie. He sang for many bands. He made himself ""known"" with his onstage antics of defication, unrinating, raping and beating up his crowds while performing naked.If you like gore films, punk rock, or a good laugh check this out. Watch GG Allin pee on his audience before knocking them out with his fist.GG Allin died in 1993 from a heroin overdose ending his 17 year music career on a sour note for most fans. (He promised to commit suicide on Haloween).Beware though his music was not very ""radio friendly"" or even lsitenable at times. Infact some of his live shows were nothing but noise. That's why I suggest watching a live concert rather than listening to a live GG Allin song.I guarantee you will either laugh or gasp at his lack of a penis. haha",5,GG ALLIN IS GOD,1089244800,"07 8, 2004",2004,861,"['Even', 'are', 'not', 'GG', 'Allin', 'fan', 'reccomend', 'GG', 'Allin', 'was', 'dirty', 'good', 'sadistic', 'dirty', 'sexual', 'junkie', 'sang', 'many', 'bands', 'made', 'known', 'onstage', 'antics', 'defication', 'unrinating', 'raping', 'beating', 'up', 'crowds', 'performing', 'naked.If', 'gore', 'films', 'punk', 'rock', 'good', 'laugh', 'check', 'out', 'Watch', 'GG', 'Allin', 'pee', 'audience', 'knocking', 'out', 'fist.GG', 'Allin', 'died', '1993', 'heroin', 'overdose', 'ending', '17', 'year', 'music', 'career', 'sour', 'note', 'most', 'fans', 'promised', 'commit', 'suicide', 'Haloween', '.Beware', 'music', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'radio', 'friendly', 'even', 'lsitenable', 'times', 'Infact', 'live', 'shows', 'were', 'nothing', 'noise', 'why', 'suggest', 'watching', 'live', 'concert', 'rather', 'listening', 'live', 'GG', 'Allin', 'song.I', 'guarantee', 'will', 'either', 'laugh', 'gasp', 'lack', 'penis', 'haha']",N/A

Some of the shows are for a very collegiate looking crowd and they seem as accepting and into it as the punks, which is interesting. However, there is much like this out on the market and what is most interesting here is the first ever interview with GG Allin's mother. She is proud of her boys and very candid about their early years.

Since he literally pulls his live audience kicking and screaming into the pit of these nightmarish encounters, the distancing via TV is a no small advantage.  Still you won't be all that protected.  The rage of the man is visceral, self-directed and painfully honest.Why bother then?  Well, it is fascinating because of the commitment of GG, the band and audience.  GG Allin is a necessary balance to the sin of Rock N' Roll giving itself a Hall of Fame.I use DVDs mostly as a diversion while running on a treadmill, and frankly this is one of the best for making you forget time & pain.
