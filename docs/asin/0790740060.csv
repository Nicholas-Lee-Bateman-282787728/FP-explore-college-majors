107373,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,0790740060,Acute Observer,"[4, 20]","This is a fantasy film about a family of witches in modern times. The Owens girls are hereditary witches, any man who loves one is doomed to an early death. There is a scene where a woman asks for a love potion, this requires the sacrifice of a dove. Two little girls watch. Years later they're grown up. One leaves to live with her boyfriend. But the curse returns and a boyfriend is run over by a truck (never stand in the middle of a road). We see scenes where the neighbor kids yell ""witch"", as if to symbolize something.Sally goes when Jillian calls her; she has a problem with her boyfriend. But Sally uses a ""magic potion"" to eliminate the problem. Now Jillian wants to undo what was done. [The film began to lose me now, it wasn't funny.] The spell goes awry, they bury their mistake. Then there is a scene where the ladies are all giggles. Later an investigator comes around looking for Jimmy. [The story drags again.] More scenes follow; they are not funny or scary or even entertaining. But a scene in the attic will wake you even if you're snoozing! They call some friends over to cast a spell to drive a demon out of Jillian. It seems to work, even if they don't use the standard issue witches broom. There is a sort of happy ending.Sandra and Nicole are good actresses, but they can't cast a spell to improve the script of one of the worst movies I've ever seen.

107387,AHSY48775P8RI,0790740060,Avalon Daughter,"[129, 138]","I bought this movie after it came out and pop it in every couple of months.  &quot;Practical Magic&quot; is a wonderful, have-fun movie that is just right as a Halloween movie for any age (save maybe very, very young viewers.)  I know because every Halloween party I've had, this movie has delighted my guests.Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman are wonderful as two sisters in this movie.  Their on-screen chemistry is amazing.  You can't help but smile as they joke with each other and interact because it reminds you of how you were with a close sibling or how you wish you could be with one.Stockard Channing and Dianne Wiest are amazing.  As supporting actresses, they almost steal the show as they are described as the aunts who are &quot;sugar and spice&quot; by the director, Griffin Dunne.The story is about two sisters who are very close who live with their aunts in what I assume is a New England town.  They have the reputation of being &quot;witches&quot; who curse any man who dares love an Owens woman.  Of course, Gillian (Nicole Kidman) and Sally (Sandra Bullock) get into a bit of trouble as Gillian's evil boyfriend Jimmy (Goran Visnjic) accidently ends up dead at their hands through self-defense that can be deemed suspicious by anyone else and they try to figure out a way to cover it up.  Things get stickier when the Officer Hallet (Adian Quinn) shows up to find the wanted Jimmy and sparks fly between Sally and Officer Hallet.  Do they try to send him away and risk Sally losing her one true love?  Or do they let him stay and risk Gillian and Sally getting caught while Jimmy's ghost continues to torment Gillian?This movie is based on a third of Alice Hoffman's wonderful book by the same name.  For those of you who have seen the movie (spoiler alert) and are curious about the book, you won't be disappointed.  Remember the woman that wished to take another woman's husband?  Well, you get to find out what happens to her as well as the adventures that Sally's daughters get into as they grow up.  In other words, the book is better than the movie, but the movie is just as fun as the book.As for those of you who like DVDs and their extra features, it is chock-full of them.  From the game of &quot;find the ingredients to mix the love potion&quot; you have to search through the various features in the DVD to click on &quot;ingredients&quot; and get clues as to mixing the love potion which opens up a whole behind-the-scenes featurette.  It also contains trailers, bios, and other little tidbits that were artistically designed well and accompanied by wonderful little chimes and music.This &quot;witch&quot; movie is not quite as dark as &quot;the Craft&quot; (or ridiculous for that matter) as not as sex-filled as &quot;Witches of Eastwick&quot; but genuinely wholesome, fun and delightful.  Especially the &quot;Midnight Margaritas&quot; scene which will have you humming the tune for days.  A good recommendation for a Halloween movie for most ages.",5,VERY underrated movie!

They also have to overcome (if possible) the family curse that the gentlemen in their lives are distending to meat an early demise.

The house was set somewhere in Maine but the action took place in some strange places.  It almost makes one belief that witchcraft is alive and well in the modern age.The two older witches were especially good.  Sandra Bullock, on the other hand, was playing a continuation of her character in HOPE FLOATS, same funky outfits and the acting just the same.These beautiful witches had the bad luck to always kill the men they love.  No matter how many potions they tried to concoct, nothing ever came out right.  The little ones had no special magic, and yet their peers called them witches just the same.The living dead had eyes like Riddick.  Now, I understand where he got his strength; he was already dead.  What'd he have to lose?I enjoyed this romp, but I have always been interested in how the women in Salem and along the Eastern coast were burned as witches.  Even Guinevere in Richard Harris' version of CAMELOT was 'almost' killed as a witch.  Thank God, she was rescued by her Sir Lancelot to waste away in a nunnery.

When a witch fell in love with someone who didn't return it, she cast a curse upon the family that any witch in the family would be fated to lose the one they love,when a dark beetle was seen in the home. Sally had fallen deeply in love with a young man who fell victim to the curse and died, struck by a vehicle. In her grief, she begged for his return and was denied. It was only after her sister Gillian had fallen afoul to a possessive man,when she tried to leave him that she discovered why,when in a fit of rage, he attacked them and in self defense, they had poisoned him. Because they did not want to be arrested for murder, they tried to bring him back and were successful--only to have to kill him again when he attacked them the moment he awoke. Then, it became a matter of putting the spirit back into the grave, all while under the attention of a police detective who had taken to Sally. The movie ends in a wild ritual held by the older witches to free Gillian from the overly possessive ghost. Here, we see witches not as the dark cackling creatures of myth and legend, but as very real people who deal with life in an unorthodox way, and deal with the prejudices of the town in their stride as well.

107438,A84Z6XUMGRMJ1,0790740060,Duane Thomas,"[6, 9]","Sally Owens (Sandra Bullock) and sister Gillian (Nicole Kidman) are modern day witches, with real magical powers. Sally is shy and conventional, only wanting to ignore her power, fit into the everyday world and live a normal life. Gillian is the wild child who runs away from home to live life in the fast lane - sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll - until her psycho boyfriend turns mean and she calls on Sally for help.I have to register one major gripe with this film. I mean, it truly drove me nuts. In the opening scene, when the girls' ancestor, witch Maria Owens, is about to be hanged, the noose around her neck isn't even pulled tight. It's about two feet across and, if she'd actually taken the big fall, would've slipped right off her head. Amazing sloppiness on the filmmakers' part. It's hard to get caught up in a movie when, during the very first scene, you're shaking your head and muttering, ""What were they THINKING?""The Owens women, thanks to a curse laid by Maria, are doomed to have any man they love die. Sally as a little girl has the perfect solution: she casts a spell wishing for a man with an impossible list of attributes. ""He will hear my call a mile away. He will whistle my favorite song. He can ride a pony backwards. He can flip pancakes in the air. He'll be marveously kind. And his favorite shape will be a star."" Since such a man can't possibly exist, she'll never be in love, thus never suffer a broken heart. Years later Sally falls in love, not with her dream man but a normal guy, they marry and have two beautiful daughters - then he's run over in the street. Sally, recognizing the curse, concludes she'll never love again. Then one day, up shows Aidan Quinn....Trailers for this film were really misleading. If all you knew about Practical Magic came from them, you'd think it was a bright, happy romantic comedy. While there are certainly elements of that in here, it's actually a weird and not entirely successful blend of comedy, romance and violent, creeped-out horror story.Scenes like Sally kissing her future husband for the first time to the bouncy strains of Faith Hill's ""This Kiss"" or an entire family of witches, dressed in black Halloween finery, opening their umbrellas on top of a tall house, then jumping off and drifting to the ground Mary Poppins-style, are charming. They make a strange mix, however, with things like Sally bludgeoning a man to death with a frying pan, or Nicole Kidman, possessed by the spirit of that self-same dead man (who happens to be a serial woman killer) running her tongue slooooowly along one of Sandra Bullock's incredible cheekbones and hissing, ""I'm feeling VERY into sisters right now.""(Got to hand it to Nicole Kidman, she does ""possessed"" very well. Linda Blair has nothing on this woman. Personally, I'm holding out for a movie where Nicole Kidman plays a vampire. She's already got that pale, bloodless, languid look about her; she only needs a pair of sexy needle point fangs to really rock.)But....I digress.In later scenes, the witch-phobic wives of the town, after decades of despising the Owens women, when called upon by Sally to help in Gillian's exorcism, instantly and cheerfully pitch in. This stretches the suspension of disbelief, to say the least.There are good things here, mostly Sandra Bullock, owner of one of the most beautiful, expressive faces and solid set of acting skills in Hollywood. It's just awfully hard not to like Sally Owens. She's so achingly decent (and looks just like Sandra Bullock, always a positive thing). Sally's been hard used by life, but still tries to hold it all together, be a good mother to her daughters, help Gillian in her time of need, she's ALMOST given up hope she'll ever again find love and happiness. You can't help but root for Sally. She's irresistible.Let's not forget Nicole Kidman, who obviously had a blast making this movie. No one, no matter how good an actress, could sport the evil little grin Gillian has in the ""being turned around by two girls while bound to a chair"" scene without the actress in question having the time of her life. Gillian is the dark to Sally's light, and for all their differences the bond between the sisters, their very real love, is well presented and quite believable.Practical Magic can't seem to decide whether it wants to be an upbeat, life affirming romantic comedy or a grim, frightening horror movie. By trying to be both at once, it ultimately fails at both. At the same time, though the pieces of the movie don't fit very well, some of the individual pieces are fascinating.This is certainly an interesting failure, compelling in its way. If Practical Magic doesn't totally succeed, it fails while trying to pull off something quite unusual. I'm glad I saw it.",3,"""Bewitched"" Meets ""The Exorcist""",1075507200,"01 31, 2004",2004,4754,"['Sally', 'Owens', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'sister', 'Gillian', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'are', 'modern',

I recently re-watched this film after a disastrous blind date with a man I met through Craigslist, and ""Practical Magic"" was balm for my soul. I love the book -- I have read it three times. I recommend it over the film, but then I almost always recommend the book over the film. However, this film beautifully presents what are the central themes of the book: love is priceless, the friends in our lives will always be there for us if only we ask, and the importance of the delicate balancing act between honoring ourselves separate from our lovers, while keeping our hearts forever open and ready to love.The author and filmmakers are showing us that the love between the aunts, the elder pair of sisters and the younger pair of sisters, the aunts for the girls and vice versa is just as precious, just as life-saving, just as nurturing and fulfilling as the love between the women in the story and their lovers -- sometimes more so. In a culture that has often been guilty of devaluing ""spinsters"" and the love between sisters, it sends a powerful message of the vital importance of non-sexual love in a fun, playful, entertaining package.After a bad date, there's nothing like being reminded that single women are just as lovable and just as magical alone or with their women friends and family as they are in a successful and fulfilling romantic relationship.(Spoiler alert!) One of the best lines in the film is spoken by the delicious character played by Aiden Quinn: ""Well, why don't you do what you do, and I'll do what I do, and we'll see where we end up.""That scene presents, in a nutshell, the essence of a healthy relationship: being ourselves with another person, not giving up important parts of ourselves in order to shoehorn ourselves into a relationship that doesn't fit. I can't think of a healthier message about love and dating than that. Of course the film is filled with moments of sacrifice (mother for child, sister for sister, aunt for niece, lover for lover, etc.) but in the end, love relationships only work if we can love and be loved while retaining our best, most authentic selves.After experiencing a bruise to the ego -- really thwacking into a big bump on the road to love -- being reminded in such an entertaining, engrossing way to be true to myself while keeping my heart open was well worth the price of the DVD and my time.",4,Keep this DVD on hand for watching after blind dates,1249084800,"08 1, 2009",2009,2448,"['Dating', 'can', 'be', 'harrowing', 'age', 'people', 'fifty', 'dating', 'NOT', 'sissies', 'recently', 're-watched', 'film', 'disastrous', 'blind', 'date', 'man', 'met', 'Craigslist', 'Practical', 'Magic', 'was', 'balm', 'soul', 'love', 'book', 'have', 'read', 'three', 'times', 'recommend', 'film', 'then', 'almost', 'always', 'recommend', 'book', 'film', 'However', 'film', 'beautifully', 'are', 'central', 'themes', 'book', 'love', 'priceless', 'friends', 'lives', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'there', 'only', 'ask', 'importance', 'delicate', 'balancing', 'act', 'honoring', 'separate', 'lovers', 'keeping', 'hearts', 'forever', 'open', 'ready', 'love.The', 'author', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'showing', 'love', 'aunts', 'elder', 'pair', 'sisters', 'younger', 'pair', 'sisters', 'aunts', 'girls', 'vice', 'versa', 'just', 'as', 'precious', 'just', 'life-saving', 'just', 'nurturing', 'fulfilling', 'love', 'women', 'story', 'lovers', 'sometimes', 'more', 'so', 'culture', 'often', 'been', 'guilty', 'devaluing', 'spinsters', 'love', 'sisters', 'powerful', 'message', 'vital', 'importance', 'non-sexual', 'love', 'fun', 'playful', 'entertaining', 'package.After', 'bad', 'date', 'nothing', 'being', 'reminded', 'single', 'women', 'are', 'just', 'lovable', 'just', 'as', 'magical', 'alone', 'women', 'friends', 'family', 'are', 'successful', 'fulfilling', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'Spoiler', 'alert', 'One', 'best', 'lines', 'film', 'spoken', 'delicious', 'character', 'played', 'Aiden', 'Quinn', 'Well', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'what', 'do', ""'ll"", 'do', 'what', 'do', ""'ll"", 'see', 'where', 'end', 'up', 'scene', 'presents', 'nutshell', 'essence', 'healthy', 'relationship', 'being', 'person', 'not', 'giving', 'up', 'important', 'parts', 'ourselves', 'order', 'shoehorn', 'relationship', ""n't"", 'fit', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'healthier', 'message', 'love', 'dating', 'course', 'film', 'filled', 'moments', 'sacrifice', 'mother', 'child', 'sister', 'sister', 'aunt', 'niece', 'lover', 'lover', 'etc', 'end', 'love', 'relationships', 'only', 'work', 'can', 'love', 'be', 'loved', 'retaining', 'best', 'most', 'authentic', 'selves.After', 'experiencing', 'bruise', 'ego', 'really', 'thwacking', 'big', 'bump', 'road', 'love', 'being', 'reminded', 'such', 'entertaining', 'engrossing', 'way', 'be', 'true', 'keeping', 'heart', 'open', 'was', 'well', 'price', 'DVD', 'time']",N/A

The first few months after I initially bought it, in fact, I would watch it every single Friday night without fail.  The neat thing about ""Practical Magic"" is that it is many things - it is romantic comedy; it is paranormal; it is horror; it is about family; it is about surviving in a community where you are different - it is all those things and more.  Beautifully imagined and acted, the story captivates while it carries you along with it.Sally and Jillian Owens are the latest in a line of witches stemming from Maria Owen in the 1700s.  She was set up as a witch and set to be hanged, but using her magic, she caused the rope to break.  However, she was exiled to the island on which the current Owens' live; pregnant and alone, she waited for her lover to save her.  When he did not, she cast a spell upon herself so that she would never love again; however, she became so bitter over time that it turned into a curse, one passed through the ages, causing any man that was truly loved by an Owens woman to die an untimely death.  Jilly (played by Nicole Kidman) revels in her sexuality and role as a witch; Sally (played by Sandra Bullock) longs for a normal life.  After Sally's first husband dies and she is just getting her life back together, she receives a frantic call from Jilly, whose boyfriend Jimmy Angelov has apparently snapped.  She runs to Arizona to rescue Jilly, but they both end up being taken hostage by Jimmy, who seems completely off his rocker (I can't remember the actor's name right now, but the man who plays Jimmy Angelov is amazing).  When he tries to kill Jilly, Sally ends up killing him instead.  Desperately trying to come up with a way to get out of the situation, Jilly suggests that they raise him from the dead.  This, of course, leads to unfortunate results and Sally is forced to kill him again, and they bury him out back.  Gary Hallett (Aidan Quinn), a cop from Tucson, shows up shortly thereafter, looking for Jimmy.That is a good bit of the basic plot - there is, of course, a great deal more to it and the ending is wonderfully sweet.

Gillie's the wild one, who thinks being a witch is cool. Sally wants a normal life and has avoided witchcraft like the plague; she was happily married, until her husband fell victim to the family curse, in which men who love these women suffer untimely deaths. Heartbroken, angry, and depressed, Sally moves back into her childhood home with her 2 kids, to live with the family matriarchs (Dianne Wiest and Stockard Channing).  The trouble begins when Gillie hooks up with a loser, and needs Sally to get her disentangled before the guy kills her. The sisters inadvertently kill him instead, and when they try to bring him back to life, chaos ensues.Whimsical and visually extravagant, Practical Magic swings from comedy to romance to mild horror and back again. All four actresses, each justifiably notable, are well cast. Perhaps the most fun comes from the main setting - the witches' house is a pink Victorian confection with miles of staircases and an ocean view. Magic seems possible in a house like that. Some of the dialog is reminiscent of Doris Day movies (""What wouldn't I do for the right guy?"" and ""Out of bed, sleepy head""), but some is genuinely funny. A few of the scenes may be a bit too strong for young children, but this film certainly does not have the edge of today's vamp movies.Practical Magic should not be taken too seriously as a film.

Wood ""Content Writer and Reviewer""","[1, 2]","On a small island in New England, the Owens women have always been powerful, intelligent witches with a knack for the craft. Their one difficulty is love. Centuries ago, a relative who had her heart broken screamed out her pain to the ocean and it came back to haunt every Owens women who fell in love ever since, including Sally and Gillian Owens' which is how they came to live with their eccentric Aunts whom the whole city feared and avoided. Here is where they learned about the secrets of practical magic and fun things like eating chocolate cake for breakfast and midnight margaritas.Sally Owens (Sandra Bullock) is shy behind her dark rimmed glasses and doesn't outwardly use her magic except  for the one time as a child when she cast a spell for the love of her life requesting traits she knew didn't exist (or did they) just so she couldn't fall in love and be hurt.Gillian Owens (Nicole Kidman) is a wild spirit who retains a lot of pain behind her eyes. All she wants to do is fall in love. So she runs away in the middle of the night to find it. But before she goes her and her sister cut the palms of their hands and join them, promising to always be there for one another.The Aunt's (Dianne Wiest and Stockard Channing) feeling sorry for Sally cast a little love spell of their own creating instant chemistry between her and the delivery man (Mark Feuerstein - who doesn't get the recognition he deserves). Problem is the sisters didn't expect Sally to really fall in love with him. Two daughters later, poor Sally is moving back into the family house.Gillian has been living the high life partying with many men until she meets Jimmy Angelov (Goran Visnjic) a Bulgarian who thinks he's a cowboy. Jimmy quickly becomes obsessed with Gillian, wanting to be with her every waking moment. Gillian actually has to resort to drugging him with Belladonna to get a break from their lovemaking. Gillian realizes things are out of control when Jimmy punches her in the face. Sally arrives just in time for a ring around the moon, bad omen.Officer Gary Hallet (Aidan Quinn) shows up at the Owens house looking for Jimmy, a wanted man. At first Gary thinks the sisters may be hiding him but when he learns the truth he's torn between his belief in his badge and the growing love he feels for Sally.The tagline for Practical Magic is ""There's a little witch in every woman."" And the Owens sisters are going to need all the help they can get to get rid of Jimmy and his obsession with Gillian. While music and love are the immediate themes; family, loss, being different, belief in one's self and the strength of community are others. This is an excellent fun loving film.

107546,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,0790740060,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[2, 3]","In 1998, Griffin Dunne directed the fictional film ""Practical Magic"" centered on a family of witches living in New England.  The family is descended from a persecuted, seventeenth-century witch named Maria Owens (Caprice Benedetti).  A curse that she placed on any man that falls in love with an Owens woman has haunted generations of the family for centuries, including Frances Owens (Stockard Channing) and her sister Bridget 'Jet' Owens (Dianne Wiest).  Together, they raised Sally Owens (Sandra Bullock) and Gillian Owens (Nicole Kidman) and taught them how to perform witchcraft.  Knowing the family's curse, as a little girl (played by Camilla Belle), Sally cast a spell for a man to love that she believed could not possibly exist.  However, as adults, Sally becomes unwittingly involved a very negative relationship that Gillian has had with an alcoholic boyfriend named Jimmy Angelov (Goran Visnjic).  Sally had previously married Michael (Mark Feuerstein), but his untimely death due to the family curse left Sally to raise their two daughters alone, Kylie (Evan Rachel Wood) and Antonia (Alexandra Artrip), and has given her a negative outlook towards witchcraft.  When Gillian's relationship with Jimmy takes an even larger turn for the worse, Sally and Gillian meet Gary Hallet (Aidan Quinn), who forces both of them to confront their deepest fears.With beautiful cinematography (the film was actually filmed in the Pacific Northwest), endearing characters and great acting (especially from Stockard Channing and Dianne Wiest), and a very positive and relatively accurate portrayal of witchcraft and the religion of Wicca, ""Practical Magic"" is a very entertaining film.  (The most inaccurate portrayal of Wicca and witchcraft occurs when an animal is used as part of a spell, but a Wiccan witch would never intentionally harm an animal as part of a spell or ritual.)  Other memorable characters include Linda Bennett (Margo Martindale), Carla (Chloe Webb), Patty (Martha Gehman) and Sara (Lucinda Jenney).  Memorable scenes include young Sally's spell, Michael, scenes in the shop, the car, Gillian & Sally with Jimmy in the kitchen, Gary's arrival, Frances' & Jet's return, getting help, the circle and the closing scenes.Overall, I rate ""Practical Magic"" with 4 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it.

The Nilsson song forms the backdrop for a delightful scene in which the witches cut loose and get drunk, showing how playful witches can be.  Credit the writer (based on Alice Hoffman's bestseller), director (Griffin Dunne) and the talented ladies for exposing the ""white"" side of witchcraft.Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman are delightful as two sisters whose craft has been honed by their ditzy aunts, played spritely by Stockard Channing and Dianne Weist.  The Owens women are cursed by an ancestor so that if they fall in love, their husband or boyfriend will die.  Their deaths will be foretold by the clicking of a nasty little beetle.  There's a touching poignancy in one scene where Bullock hears the beetle and tears up the house trying to find it to save her doomed husband.  Kidman goes through men like kleenex, and ends up with an abusive and dangerous one (Gorin Visjnic), who in an attempt to kidnap Kidman is accidentally poisoned by Bullock.  They haul his body to their house to try and resuscitate him, but in doing so they've created a malicious and deadly zombie.  So they kill him again, bury him in the rosegarden, and precipitate a horrifying exorcism.  Aidan Quinn steps in as an investigator looking for the nasty zombie, and love blooms between he and Bullock.The ending scenes in which the ladies of the town assist in the exorcism are touching in demonstrating how open communication can precipitate friendship, and an expected happy ending does occur.A sometimes tedious, but always entertaining film, envigorated by the presence of fine actresses.",4,DE LIME IN DE COCONUT,1098403200,"10 22, 2004",2004,1693,"['Harry', 'Nilsson', 'playful', 'Coconut', 'scene', 'often', 'funny', 'often', 'morose', 'tale', 'modern', 'day', 'witchcraft', 'Nilsson', 'song', 'backdrop', 'delightful', 'scene', 'witches', 'cut', 'loose', 'get', 'drunk', 'showing', 'how', 'playful', 'witches', 'can', 'be', 'Credit', 'writer', 'based', 'Alice', 'Hoffman', 'bestseller', 'director', 'Griffin', 'Dunne', 'talented', 'ladies', 'exposing', 'white', 'side', 'witchcraft.Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'are', 'delightful', 'two', 'sisters', 'craft', 'been', 'honed', 'ditzy', 'aunts', 'played', 'spritely', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'Dianne', 'Weist', 'Owens', 'women', 'are', 'cursed', 'ancestor', 'so', 'fall', 'love', 'husband', 'boyfriend', 'will', 'die', 'deaths', 'will', 'be', 'foretold', 'clicking', 'nasty', 'little', 'beetle', 'touching', 'poignancy', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'Bullock', 'beetle', 'up', 'house', 'trying', 'find', 'save', 'doomed', 'husband', 'Kidman', 'men', 'kleenex', 'up', 'abusive', 'dangerous', 'one', 'Gorin', 'Visjnic', 'who', 'attempt', 'kidnap', 'Kidman', 'accidentally', 'poisoned', 'Bullock', 'haul', 'body', 'house', 'try', 'resuscitate', 'doing', 'so', ""'ve"", 'created', 'malicious', 'deadly', 'zombie', 'kill', 'again', 'bury', 'rosegarden', 'precipitate', 'horrifying', 'exorcism', 'Aidan', 'Quinn', 'steps', 'investigator', 'looking', 'nasty', 'zombie', 'love', 'blooms', 'Bullock.The', 'ending', 'scenes', 'ladies', 'town', 'assist', 'exorcism', 'are', 'touching', 'demonstrating', 'how', 'open', 'communication', 'can', 'precipitate', 'friendship', 'expected', 'happy', 'ending', 'occur.A', 'sometimes', 'tedious', 'always', 'entertaining', 'film', 'envigorated', 'presence', 'fine', 'actresses']",N/A

Not only does it mix in several very good and poignant scenes with some utterly illogical and cheesy ones, but compresses within it no less than five plot strands!Gillian and Sally (Nicole Kidman and Sandra Bullock) are the latest in a long line of witches, stemming from their ancestress Maria Owens who was banished from her village on the crimes of witchcraft. Pregnant with her lovers child, and devastated that he never came to rescue her, she placed a spell upon herself that she might never again feel the pain of love. However, this spell became a curse, and for the next three hundred years, the men that any Owens women ever loved would reach an untimely end. This is what happened to Gillian and Sally's father, and soon after their mother died also of a broken heart, leaving them to stay with their quirky aunts Frances and Jet (Stockard Channing and Dianne Wiest). The four make a loving family, but as Jet puts it - 'with the sweets comes the sour', as the close-knit town community despise the strange and eccentric Owens women...except of course when its in their best interests to go to the aunts for help with their life-love.Exposed to the desparate and all-consuming nature of love that is witnesses in the aunt's customers Sally decides that she never wants to fall in love. Gillian however can't wait, and while she scampers away from the town as soon as she's old enough, Sally creates a spell in her childhood of the man she is to fall in love with - a man so perfect she feels he can not possibly exist, with qualities such as being able to flip pancakes, ride a horse backwards, and have one green and one blue eye. Her logic is if he doesn't exist, she can never have her heart broken.Time will tell differently however - by their adulthood Sally is happily married and living a blissfully normal life with two daughters and Gillian is involved with a gorgeous -but dangerous- man. Sally truly loves her husband however, and when the curse takes effect she is devastated. Gillian has problems of her own however when her boyfriend Jimmy gets violent. When Sally goes to rescue her sister they are both kidnapped by Jimmy and manage to escape only by loading his liquior bottle with belladonna, a powerful sedative. Unfortunatly, Jimmy doesn't survive the experience.Terrified, the sisters perform a ressurection spell, but when Jimmy returns as something 'dark and un-natural' they panic, knock him out and bury him in the backyard. But not all things stay buried, least of all Jimmy, and when a police-dectective from Arizona comes investigating his disappearence the house, Sally is petrified - especially since he has one green eye and one blue one...Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman are great as Gillian and Sally, and they carry full weight of the mish-mashed storyline on their shoulders. Kidman's accent faulters at times (especially whenever she says 'aunts') but on the whole performs the carefree, irresponsible younger sister very well. Bullock as the older, more composed and sensible Sally is just as good, and the two can easily pull off the sister bond.Unsurpringly Stockard Channing and Diane Weist create the aunts perfectly, with Channing as the sharper, more eccentric Frances and Weist as the gentle and kind Jet.Aidan Quinn however is nothing to sing and dance about. He enters the movie quite late, and then leaves just as early and Bullock has far more chemistry with the actor playing her first husband, even though he's in the movie for an even shorter time (or maybe its just because I love their run 'n jump kiss so much!)...",3,"Good, but Far from Perfect",1039392000,"12 9, 2002",2002,3617,"['movie', 'certainly', 'mixed', 'bag', 'Not', 'only', 'mix', 'several', 'very', 'good', 'poignant', 'scenes', 'utterly', 'illogical', 'cheesy', 'ones', 'compresses', 'less', 'five', 'plot', 'strands', 'Gillian', 'Sally', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'are', 'latest', 'long', 'line', 'witches', 'stemming', 'ancestress', 'Maria', 'Owens', 'who', 'was', 'banished', 'village', 'crimes', 'witchcraft', 'Pregnant', 'lovers', 'child', 'devastated', 'never', 'came', 'rescue', 'placed', 'spell', 'herself', 'might', 'never', 'again', 'feel', 'pain', 'love', 'However', 'spell', 'became', 'curse', 'next', 'three', 'hundred', 'years', 'men', 'Owens', 'women', 'ever', 'loved', 'would', 'reach', 'untimely', 'end', 'happened', 'Gillian', 'Sally', 'father', 'soon', 'mother', 'died', 'also', 'broken', 'heart', 'leaving', 'stay', 'quirky', 'aunts', 'Frances', 'Jet', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'Dianne', 'Wiest', 'four', 'make', 'loving', 'family', 'Jet', 'sweets', 'sour', 'close-knit', 'town', 'community', 'despise', 'strange', 'eccentric', 'Owens', 'women', 'course', 'when', 'best', 'interests', 'go', 'aunts', 'help', 'life-love.Exposed', 'desparate', 'all-consuming', 'nature', 'love', 'witnesses', 'aunt', 'customers', 'Sally', 'never', 'fall', 'love', 'Gillian', 'however', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'away', 'town', 'as', 'soon', 'old', 'enough', 'Sally', 'spell', 'childhood', 'man', 'fall', 'love', 'man', 'so', 'perfect', 'can', 'not', 'possibly', 'exist', 'qualities', 'such', 'being', 'able', 'flip', 'pancakes', 'ride', 'horse', 'backwards', 'have', 'one', 'green', 'one', 'blue', 'eye', 'logic', ""n't"", 'exist', 'can', 'never', 'have', 'heart', 'broken.Time', 'will', 'tell', 'differently', 'however', 'adulthood', 'Sally', 'happily', 'married', 'living', 'blissfully', 'normal', 'life', 'two', 'daughters', 'Gillian', 'involved', 'gorgeous', '-but', 'dangerous-', 'man', 'Sally', 'truly', 'husband', 'however', 'when', 'curse', 'effect', 'devastated', 'Gillian', 'problems', 'own', 'however', 'when', 'boyfriend', 'Jimmy', 'violent', 'When', 'Sally', 'rescue', 'sister', 'are', 'kidnapped', 'Jimmy', 'manage', 'escape', 'only', 'loading', 'liquior', 'bottle', 'belladonna', 'powerful', 'sedative', 'Unfortunatly', 'Jimmy', ""n't"", 'survive', 'experience.Terrified', 'sisters', 'perform', 'ressurection', 'spell', 'when', 'Jimmy', 'something', ""'dark"", 'un-natural', 'panic', 'knock', 'out', 'bury', 'backyard', 'not', 'things', 'stay', 'buried', 'least', 'Jimmy', 'when', 'police-dectective', 'Arizona', 'investigating', 'disappearence', 'house', 'Sally', 'petrified', 'especially', 'one', 'green', 'eye', 'one', 'blue', 'one', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'are', 'great', 'Gillian', 'Sally', 'carry', 'full', 'weight', 'mish-mashed', 'storyline', 'shoulders', 'Kidman', 'accent', 'faulters', 'times', 'especially', 'whenever', ""'aunts"", 'whole', 'carefree', 'irresponsible', 'younger', 'sister', 'very', 'well', 'Bullock', 'older', 'more', 'composed', 'sensible', 'Sally', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'two', 'can', 'easily', 'pull', 'off', 'sister', 'bond.Unsurpringly', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'Diane', 'Weist', 'create', 'aunts', 'perfectly', 'Channing', 'sharper', 'more', 'eccentric', 'Frances', 'Weist', 'gentle', 'kind', 'Jet.Aidan', 'Quinn', 'however', 'nothing', 'sing', 'dance', 'about', 'movie', 'quite', 'late', 'then', 'just', 'early', 'Bullock', 'far', 'more', 'chemistry', 'actor', 'playing', 'first', 'husband', 'even', 'movie', 'even', 'shorter', 'time', 'maybe', 'just', 'love', 'run', 'n', 'jump', 'kiss', 'so', 'much']",N/A

107584,AK1OBVI54SY73,0790740060,"Rocky ""Raquel""","[1, 3]","All right well I've known this movie for a long time. I believe I did watch the film first and then went out to get the book. Yet upon reading the book I realized how much different it really is. The movie really gutted out the book, only taking the main characters and one or two snippets from the book then adding the rest in as just pure Hollywood writing.For one thing, Jimmy never goes into Gillian and possesses her. He haunts Gillian in her dreams but never personally in her body and no Gary Hallet never sees Jimmy's ghost in the book- which I thought was kind of dumb in the movie. They never tried to bring Jimmy back to life either, which I felt in the movie, although of course in Hollywood style it looked cool, was a waste of time nonetheless cause once again they had to hit him till he died again then as it said in the book went out and buried him in the backyard. Honestly they should have just did that instead of the whole bring back the dead thing. The aunts in this movie are pretty nice and warm and funny- unlike the aunts in the book who are serious and just real old. Sally did not live with the aunts, matter of fact when the love of her life in the beginning died she actually moved to another place and raised her daughters in a comunity where no one knew the name Owens and they buried Jimmy back in that yard not the aunt's. Sally doesn't go find Gillian but Gillian comes to her doorstep and has Jimmy already dead in the car because she said she probably gave him too much nightshade. Another problem was that they switched Antonia and Kylie around- Kylie was the younger one who actually saw Jimmy in the garden and Antonia was the red- haired one- I don't get why they switched that around. And they didn't highlight Antonia and Kylie personally truly at all which was a great part in the book. Then there is Gillian's eventual lover who they don't even bother to mention- which I wish they did cause Gillian deserves a happy ending as well. And also there was never anything in the book I read that said any man who loved an Owens would eventually die. That's Hollywood writing again. Sally's first love just died on accident, it had nothing to with any curse.So yes they cut out a whole lot, more than they should have, of the book just to keep it a good family movie with a more heavy twist of magic in it than there was in the book. And I will admit that the movie is enjoyable to watch. It's just the book I found has a much better story in it, and a more realistic approach than the movie did. Overall though the essence of the story is there- that even though both sisters part their ways early in their lives, they come back to help each other for they truly did need help that only the other sister could give, and that is what makes the story, both in the movie and story- magical. And I must say Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman were to me the perfect Sally and Gillian. Especially Sandra as Sally I totally believed her in that part.Yet I do strongly recommend the book if you loved the movie. There is a lot more to the story than the movie gives so just at least read the book to see the great parts left out of the story on this one and I do hope one day that they do remake the movie to be more accurate on the book.",3,Not As Good As The Book But Still...,1138492800,"01 29, 2006",2006,3268,"['right', 'well', ""'ve"", 'known', 'movie', 'long', 'time', 'believe', 'did', 'watch', 'film', 'first', 'then', 'went', 'out', 'get', 'book', 'reading', 'book', 'realized', 'how', 'much', 'different', 'really', 'movie', 'really', 'gutted', 'out', 'book', 'only', 'taking', 'main', 'characters', 'one', 'two', 'snippets', 'book', 'then', 'adding', 'rest', 'as', 'just', 'pure', 'Hollywood', 'writing.For', 'one', 'thing', 'Jimmy', 'never', 'Gillian', 'Gillian', 'dreams', 'never', 'personally', 'body', 'Gary', 'Hallet', 'never', 'Jimmy', 'ghost', 'book-', 'thought', 'was', 'kind', 'dumb', 'movie', 'never', 'tried', 'bring', 'Jimmy', 'back', 'life', 'either', 'felt', 'movie', 'course', 'Hollywood', 'style', 'looked', 'cool', 'was', 'waste', 'time', 'nonetheless', 'cause', 'once', 'again', 'had', 'hit', 'till', 'died', 'again', 'then', 'said', 'book', 'went', 'buried', 'backyard', 'Honestly', 'should', 'have', 'just', 'did', 'instead', 'whole', 'bring', 'back', 'dead', 'thing', 'aunts', 'movie', 'are', 'pretty', 'nice', 'warm', 'funny-', 'aunts', 'book', 'who', 'are', 'serious', 'just', 'real', 'old', 'Sally', 'did', 'not', 'live', 'aunts', 'matter', 'fact', 'when', 'love', 'life', 'beginning', 'died', 'actually', 'moved', 'place', 'raised', 'daughters', 'comunity', 'where', 'one', 'knew', 'name', 'Owens', 'buried', 'Jimmy', 'back', 'yard', 'not', 'aunt', 'Sally', ""n't"", 'go', 'find', 'Gillian', 'Gillian', 'doorstep', 'Jimmy', 'already', 'car', 'said', 'probably', 'gave', 'too', 'much', 'nightshade', 'problem', 'was', 'switched', 'Antonia', 'Kylie', 'around-', 'Kylie', 'was', 'younger', 'one', 'who', 'actually', 'saw', 'Jimmy', 'garden', 'Antonia', 'was', 'red-', 'haired', 'one-', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'why', 'switched', 'did', ""n't"", 'highlight', 'Antonia', 'Kylie', 'personally', 'truly', 'was', 'great', 'part', 'book', 'Then', 'Gillian', 'eventual', 'lover', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'mention-', 'wish', 'did', 'cause', 'Gillian', 'happy', 'ending', 'as', 'well', 'also', 'was', 'never', 'anything', 'book', 'read', 'said', 'man', 'who', 'loved', 'Owens', 'would', 'eventually', 'die', 'Hollywood', 'writing', 'again', 'Sally', 'first', 'love', 'just', 'died', 'accident', 'had', 'nothing', 'curse.So', 'yes', 'cut', 'out', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'should', 'have', 'book', 'just', 'keep', 'good', 'family', 'movie', 'more', 'heavy', 'twist', 'magic', 'was', 'book', 'will', 'admit', 'movie', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'just', 'book', 'found', 'much', 'better', 'story', 'more', 'realistic', 'approach', 'movie', 'did', 'Overall', 'essence', 'story', 'there-', 'even', 'sisters', 'part', 'ways', 'early', 'lives', 'come', 'back', 'help', 'other', 'truly', 'did', 'need', 'help', 'only', 'other', 'sister', 'could', 'give', 'story', 'movie', 'story-', 'magical', 'must', 'say', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'were', 'perfect', 'Sally', 'Gillian', 'Especially', 'Sandra', 'Sally', 'totally', 'believed', 'part.Yet', 'do', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'book', 'loved', 'movie', 'lot', 'more', 'story', 'movie', 'so', 'just', 'least', 'read', 'book', 'see', 'great', 'parts', 'left', 'story', 'one', 'do', 'hope', 'one', 'day', 'do', 'remake', 'movie', 'be', 'more', 'accurate', 'book']",N/A

Stockard Channing is  worth seeing at any time, in anything.Where I have a problem is with the  Kidman character;  is it really necessary to the plot for her to be quite  so blazingly stupid, or to present such a pouty-little-girl-sexpot?  She  creates such an over the top bimbo here that it's practically a misogynist  caricature -- a throwback to the Sixties.

Both Bullock &amp; Kidman are excellent &amp; their characters are well-drawn, likable &amp; familiar. Most women will relate to the loves &amp; losses, trials &amp; errors of these independent young women.They are, of course, different in some ways. Born into a legacy of witches &amp; dark history, the Owens females live under a curse that destroys any man who gets too close to them. (Then again, some of us may have felt 'cursed' more than once in our love lives...)Bullock plays Sally, the levelheaded one who is determined to have a &quot;normal&quot; life. She falls in love early (w/a little crafty help from the aunts -Stockard Channing &amp; Dianne Wiest), then marries &amp; has two daughters who look exactly like she &amp; 'Gillie' (Kidman). For a few years, Sally is blissfully happy until the day she hears the cricket chirp - a sign of impending death. After her husband is killed, Sally falls into a depression so deep that only her sister can pull her out.They have an unbreakable bond - not only of blood &amp; love, but of spirit. The strength of this bond actually saves Gillie's life, when she manages to hook-up with an evil madman who 'comes back' from death. The ending is quite well done.This was a movie about belief, trust, family &amp; a very old fight - good vs. evil.  It was also about a love strong &amp; pure enough to break a centuries-old curse, true enough to save a woman pulled in the depths of true evil. It is touching, satisfying &amp; emotionally uplifting. Rent it!

Slipping your boyfriend BELLADONNA so you  can get some shut eye is a definite sign of a problem! Um, hello?This  movie touched me very much because of the relationship between the sisters,  all of them, 3 generations. I do not have a sister. And it was so moving to  see the dynamics of the relationships. It brought tears to my eyes in some  scenes because I have a best friend that I love as much as these sisters  all love eachother.Some people have said the movie was boring or slow. I  would argue that these people are not able to see the deeper meanings and  layers to the film. The set is GORGEOUS and the acting (except for Quinn,  he is kinda blah) is superb. This movie also shows ""witches"" in a  much more favorable light than say HOCUS POCUS. or The Craft. It's also  nothing like the Witches of Eastwick.Young beautiful women with  problems. Love, acceptance, internal struggles etc.  One sister that is  afraid to fall in love - another sister falls in love with the wrong man.  They are both so glamourous.

Sandra Bullock turns in a good performance as a woman afflicted by a strange family curse: the men she has romantic  feelings for must die. Her sister, played by Nicole Kidman, is only cursed  by the lack of good judgment, and ends up in abusive relationships. Kidman  is outstanding in this movie, but that is not enough to make me like the  entire project. The plot does not hang together very well, and I found some  characters, the aunts, for example, annoying. I hope Sandra Bullock and  Nicole Kidman do make another movie together, if only to redeem themselves.  I know it's not their fault--we all need to make a living--but the movie is  significantly below their potential. Frankly, I don't understand why so  many women seem to be in love with this movie. If this is what passes for  &quot;female-centric&quot; today, well, so much the worse, because women  are not shown in a good light here. They are either careless, or cursed, or  they lack commong sense. Having said this, the movie did seem scary to me.  Maybe because I watched it in a specific environment: the lampshades in my  suite were black, and I had overeaten that night at the buffet. The movie  helped to give me indigestion and disturbed my sleep. The movie is not  magical, and its characters are certainly not practical.

It is the supernatural tale of two sisters and their aunts who come from a magical family.One sister, Gillian, is a wild-child and thrives on mischief and drama, and the other, Sally, is exceptionally gifted witch who would give anything to be normal. They are guided and supported by two eccentric aunts--Frances and Jet--who make it a habit to ""meddle in people's love lives.""The problems start when Sally's husband dies and Gillian is abused by her boyfriend. Somehow the two sisters must work together to save Gillian, get rid of the jerk who just won't go away, and give Sally the love that she's been seeking her whole life.Unfortunately, the trailers are not an accurate portrayal of what the film is about, which is why some movie-goers were disappointed. The truth is that Practical Magic is about family and about sisterhood. In the trailers, you are lead to believe that the movie is about getting Sally a boyfriend even though she's a witch. While this is an element of the movie, you'll be disatisfied if you go into it with that expectation.The movie is actually about becoming who you already are and finding true love. True love, in this case, goes deeper than romantic love; it's the love of a sister who is your soul mate, the love of your children and relatives, and the love of a man who accepts you completely as you are.If you are looking for love with a little magic thrown in, then Practical Magic is great fun!",5,A secret pleasure,1127347200,"09 22, 2005",2005,1540,"['one', 'secret', 'pleasures', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'times', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'can', 'watch', 'again', 'supernatural', 'tale', 'two', 'sisters', 'aunts', 'who', 'come', 'magical', 'family.One', 'sister', 'Gillian', 'wild-child', 'thrives', 'mischief', 'drama', 'other', 'Sally', 'exceptionally', 'gifted', 'witch', 'who', 'would', 'give', 'anything', 'be', 'normal', 'are', 'guided', 'supported', 'two', 'eccentric', 'aunts', 'Frances', 'Jet', 'who', 'make', 'habit', 'meddle', 'people', 'love', 'problems', 'start', 'when', 'Sally', 'husband', 'dies', 'Gillian', 'abused', 'boyfriend', 'Somehow', 'two', 'sisters', 'must', 'work', 'together', 'save', 'Gillian', 'get', 'rid', 'jerk', 'who', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'away', 'give', 'Sally', 'love', 'been', 'seeking', 'whole', 'life.Unfortunately', 'trailers', 'are', 'not', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'what', 'film', 'why', 'movie-goers', 'were', 'disappointed', 'truth', 'Practical', 'Magic', 'family', 'sisterhood', 'trailers', 'are', 'lead', 'believe', 'movie', 'getting', 'Sally', 'boyfriend', 'even', 'witch', 'element', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'be', 'disatisfied', 'go', 'expectation.The', 'movie', 'actually', 'becoming', 'who', 'already', 'are', 'finding', 'true', 'love', 'True', 'love', 'case', 'deeper', 'romantic', 'love', 'love', 'sister', 'who', 'soul', 'mate', 'love', 'children', 'relatives', 'love', 'man', 'who', 'completely', 'are.If', 'are', 'looking', 'love', 'little', 'magic', 'thrown', 'then', 'Practical', 'Magic', 'great', 'fun']",N/A

It seems so obvious to me!It's NOT about the magic.  It's NOT about the witchcraft.  It's NOT about the romance.It's about the power of numbers.  In particular, it's about how a group of women can achieve results in the fight against the physical abuse of womankind, when a single victim, with or without the help of a friend or relative or two, can not.  On a lesser scale, it's also about how women who are not prone to victimization can rescue those who are. Is a pumpkin pie about the spice?  Is a dish that is served 'flambe' about the alcohol?  This movie contains a lot of ""food for thought.""  Superficially, yes, it is a bit of fluff, not meant to be taken seriously or as a work of art.  But dig a bit deeper for goodness sake!  There's a lot to dig for here!Sandra Bullock [Sally] is wonderful as the thoughtful, sensitive sister.  Nicole Kidman is, if anything, even better as the flighty, unthoughtful, prone-to-be-victimized sibling [Gillian].  (And it's a master touch that one of Sally's kids looks exactly like a small Gillian!)My only complaint is with the soundtrack, which so many reviewers have gushed about.  There are two ways of using well-known songs as plot devices in a movie.  One is to choose songs that meld right into the story line [see O Brother, Where Art Thou, for example].  The other is to make the plot line swerve to incorporate the desired song.  Unfortunately, this movie chose the latter path.  They're good songs, one and all, but they jar here because they don't seamlessly fit the story line.As to the Special Features on the DVD, forget trying to find the clues in the Menu Pages to unlock the Cauldron.
