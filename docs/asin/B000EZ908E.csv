Some classic and hilarious episodes, The Bingo episode where Roseanne is addicted to bingo, The Birth Control Pill episode, where Becky asks Roseanne for those little white pills. The two-part Vegas episode, where Arnie and Nancy tie the knot in a tacky wedding chapel, Roseanne and Dan serve as the maid of honor and best man. The Fade to Black episode where Darlene becomes depressed for practically the entire season, she is moody, withdrawan, wears black all the time because she feels like an outsider in her first year at high school (hey didn't we all?)

When you hear people saying ""Roseanne"" was one of the best shows of all time, they are not referring to Season Nine, they are referring to Season Four.  This season ties with Season Five as the best year of the entire series run.  Every episode is hilarious, sad, truthful, realistic, and moving.  This was also the final season with the full cast.  Although Lecy Goranson is in the credits for all of Season Five, she is only in a few episodes, and this is the last season in which she appeared in every episode.  The entire cast is at their best this year.  Roseanne gives probably her best performance of the whole show as the most realistic mother on TV.  Her chemisty with John Goodman is outstanding.  Laurie Metcalf got her first of three consecutive Emmys for this season, and it's no wonder why.  Her balance of comedy and sadness is something I've never seen in another actor, but she makes it all funny.  The kids are also at the top of their game this year, although special mention must be made to Sara Gilbert, who gives an amazing, award worthy performance as Darlene.  Her interaction with the whole family is so amazingly real, you have to see it to believe it.  This is also a great season for Lecy Goranson, who really gives Becky a certain growth.  Her relationship with Mark (played by the late Glenn Quinn) really grows this season and we see many, many levels of her character.  Watch ""Breakin' Up Is Hard To Do"" for a great example of her skill.I seriously mean it when I say every episode from this season is good, all the way from the famous premiere episode ""A Bitter Pill To Swallow,"" in which Becky asks her mother for birth control, to the finale, ""Aliens,"" in which Arnie is abducted by aliens (seriously).  Inbetween we get some of the series best episodes, including ""Tolerate Thy Neighbor,"" ""Trick Me Up, Trick Me Down,"" ""Thanksgiving 1991,"" ""Santa Claus,"" ""The Back Story,"" ""Less Is More,"" and ""Deliverance.""I'd like to say a few things about ""Santa Claus,"" because I think this episode is an amazing example of just how wonderful this show was.  In the episode, Roseanne puts on the fat suit and plays Santa herself when no one else volunteers to do it.  In any other sitcom, that would be it.  We would have an entire episode about the wacky things that happen to our main character dressed up as Santa.  But, ""Roseanne"" was not just another sitcom, and a good chunk of the episode revolves around Roseanne meeting Darlene's adult friend, Karen.  The ending with Roseanne's Christmas bonus on the fridge is incredibly moving.  There are no words to describe how special this show was, and this episode is a prime example of just how good it was.The DVD is actually a big improvement over the previous batch, thanks to two video commentaries by Roseanne herself on ""Trick Me Up, Trick Me Down,"" and ""Thanksgiving 1991.""  She gives her inside views on all sorts of things and discusses working with all the actors.  One thing that was suspicious, however, was the fact that the episodes she is commenting on are presented in their syndicated version.  Strange, but the episodes themsevles are all presented uncut, so we should be thankful.  The Michael Fishman/Lecy Goranson interview is a real rip, since it's just recycled footage from the Season Two and Season Three sets, but it's not that big a deal considering we get commentary.  I hope to see more commentary from Roseanne on the next seasons.Even if the set came with no special features, I would tell you to pick it up.  The 1991-1992 season of ""Roseanne"" was one of the finest seasons of television ever, no exaggeration.  Everything about this season is pitch perfect and a clear example of just how great this show really was.  Pick it up right now.Grade: A+",5,Unspeakably Brilliant,1152489600,"07 10, 2006",2006,3797,"['Yes', 'friends', 'neighbors', 'When', 'hear', 'people', 'saying', 'Roseanne', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'time', 'are', 'not', 'referring', 'Season', 'Nine', 'are', 'referring', 'Season', 'Four', 'season', 'Season', 'Five', 'best', 'year', 'entire', 'series', 'run', 'episode', 'hilarious', 'sad', 'truthful', 'realistic', 'moving', 'was', 'also', 'final', 'season', 'full', 'cast', 'Lecy', 'Goranson', 'credits', 'Season', 'Five', 'only', 'few', 'episodes', 'last', 'season', 'appeared', 'episode', 'entire', 'cast', 'best', 'year', 'Roseanne', 'probably', 'best', 'performance', 'whole', 'show', 'most', 'realistic', 'mother', 'TV', 'chemisty', 'John', 'Goodman', 'outstanding', 'Laurie', 'Metcalf', 'got', 'first', 'three', 'consecutive', 'Emmys', 'season', 'wonder', 'why', 'balance', 'comedy', 'sadness', 'something', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'actor', 'funny', 'kids', 'are', 'also', 'top', 'game', 'year', 'special', 'mention', 'must', 'be', 'made', 'Sara', 'Gilbert', 'who', 'amazing', 'award', 'worthy', 'performance', 'Darlene', 'interaction', 'whole', 'family', 'so', 'amazingly', 'real', 'have', 'see', 'believe', 'also', 'great', 'season', 'Lecy', 'Goranson', 'who', 'really', 'Becky', 'certain', 'growth', 'relationship', 'Mark', 'played', 'late', 'Glenn', 'Quinn', 'really', 'season', 'see', 'many', 'many', 'levels', 'character', 'Watch', 'Breakin', 'Up', 'Hard', 'Do', 'great', 'example', 'skill.I', 'seriously', 'mean', 'when', 'say', 'episode', 'season', 'good', 'way', 'famous', 'premiere', 'episode', 'A', 'Bitter', 'Pill', 'Swallow', 'Becky', 'mother', 'birth', 'control', 'finale', 'Aliens', 'Arnie', 'abducted', 'aliens', 'seriously', 'Inbetween', 'get', 'series', 'best', 'episodes', 'including', 'Tolerate', 'Thy', 'Neighbor', 'Trick', 'Me', 'Up', 'Trick', 'Me', 'Down', 'Thanksgiving', '1991', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'Back', 'Story', 'Less', 'More', 'Deliverance', ""'d"", 'like', 'say', 'few', 'things', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'think', 'episode', 'amazing', 'example', 'just', 'how', 'wonderful', 'show', 'was', 'episode', 'Roseanne', 'fat', 'suit', 'Santa', 'when', 'one', 'else', 'do', 'other', 'sitcom', 'would', 'be', 'would', 'have', 'entire', 'episode', 'wacky', 'things', 'happen', 'main', 'character', 'dressed', 'up', 'Santa', 'Roseanne', 'was', 'not', 'just', 'sitcom', 'good', 'chunk', 'episode', 'Roseanne', 'meeting', 'Darlene', 'adult', 'friend', 'Karen', 'ending', 'Roseanne', 'Christmas', 'bonus', 'fridge', 'incredibly', 'moving', 'are', 'words', 'describe', 'how', 'special', 'show', 'was', 'episode', 'prime', 'example', 'just', 'how', 'good', 'was.The', 'DVD', 'actually', 'big', 'improvement', 'previous', 'batch', 'thanks', 'two', 'video', 'commentaries', 'Roseanne', 'Trick', 'Me', 'Up', 'Trick', 'Me', 'Down', 'Thanksgiving', '1991', 'inside', 'views', 'sorts', 'things', 'discusses', 'working', 'actors', 'One', 'thing', 'was', 'suspicious', 'however', 'was', 'fact', 'episodes', 'commenting', 'are', 'presented', 'syndicated', 'version', 'Strange', 'episodes', 'themsevles', 'are', 'presented', 'uncut', 'should', 'be', 'thankful', 'Michael', 'Fishman/Lecy', 'Goranson', 'interview', 'real', 'rip', 'just', 'recycled', 'footage', 'Season', 'Two', 'Season', 'Three', 'sets', 'not', 'big', 'deal', 'considering', 'get', 'commentary', 'hope', 'see', 'more', 'commentary', 'Roseanne', 'next', 'seasons.Even', 'set', 'came', 'special', 'features', 'would', 'tell', 'pick', 'up', '1991-1992', 'season', 'Roseanne', 'was', 'one', 'finest', 'seasons', 'television', 'ever', 'exaggeration', 'Everything', 'season', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'clear', 'example', 'just', 'how', 'great', 'show', 'really', 'was', 'Pick', 'up', 'right', 'now.Grade', 'A+']",N/A
980907,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B000EZ908E,calvinnme,"[3, 3]","Season Four of Roseanne has some of the best individual episodes as well as the best overall storyline of any of the show's nine seasons. The season opens with the Conners having opened their motorcycle shop on their own after irresponsible friend Ziggy ran out on them at the last minute last season, Roseanne and Dan have finally accepted Becky and Mark as a couple, Darlene is starting high school, and Jackie has been drifting ever since she left the police force rather than accept a desk job due to her back injury.The season opener, ""A Bitter Pill to Swallow"", is excellent as Becky - under advisement of Jackie - goes to Roseanne and asks her for the birth control pill. Obviously, the boy involved is Mark, and, as Becky freely admits, the sexual part of the relationship has already begun, she just wants a safer method. Roseanne's immediate reaction to Becky's request is hilarious as she has a Joker-sized grin on her face that says she is having a nervous breakdown, but she manages to hold it together and keeps her cool. It's a great episode dealing with the struggle between rewarding your kids for being responsible and truthful, and at the same time wondering if your own permissiveness as parents got you to this point in the first place.The situation of the Conners opening the motorcycle shop Dan's always dreamed of, and watching that dream ultimately go up in smoke over the course of a year, is handled skillfully too. Too often in TV, characters  open a business and somehow everything just magically falls into place, when in actuality over 90% of these startups fail. The show pulls no punches in portraying the sacrifices made to get the business started, the disappointment as things never really take off, and the financial fall-out to the entire family when the end finally comes. ""Take My Bike ... Please!"", the second episode of the season, shows the hard work and sacrifices involved as Roseanne is enlisted to work at the shop since the Conners cannot afford a second paid employee. On top of this, she has her job at the diner, and the household is falling apart as the kids are not holding up their end with the housework. Dan says she can't quit working at the cycle shop until she sells a bike, and she finds it as difficult to move a motorcycle as it was to sell magazine subscriptions in season two, even if the customers do actually come to you versus you phoning them. Particularly poignant in this episode is D.J.'s little tirade about him feeling ignored and left out. Dan and Roseanne apologize to him and promise to read him a bedtime story. Exhausted, they head to bed themselves, having completely forgotten D.J. a full five minutes after they promised to be more mindful of him. Fortunately they remember and head upstairs to keep their promise to him.The Bowmans, the Conners' snobby neighbors are still around. Actually Mr.Bowman is fitting in just fine. It is his wife, Kathy, that is very unhappy living in Lanford. She is not amused when the Conners' annual Halloween hijinks involve her. This year's prank has what appears to be a blood-spattered Roseanne greeting Kathy in her living room, cleaver still in hand, acting as though she has just murdered Dan in a homicidal rage and that Kathy is next. When Kathy learns this is all just a joke, she seems more upset than she was at the idea of Roseanne having gone over the edge and after her. Now Roseanne and Dan's annual Halloween outing at the lodge has a pall cast over it due to Roseanne's expectation that Kathy will retaliate with a prank of her own. She drives Dan to distraction with her suspicions until Dan is forced to fake a prank and lay it on Kathy so that Roseanne will finally relax. I thought it was one of the better Halloween episodes.Darlene begins high school this year, and it is not a happy transition. In ""Darlene Fades to Black"", she feels like she doesn't fit in with her middle school friends any more, but she can't find a place in high school social life in which she belongs either. As a result she begins to go gothic, lies on the couch watching TV all day, and refuses to communicate with anyone. As Dan and Roseanne focus on Darlene due to her bizarre behavior, it just causes trouble with the other kids since they see it as Darlene being rewarded with attention for being a problem. This is a very realistic portrayal of a situation many parents face when balancing the needs of one depressed child with those of the other children that seem well adjusted and end up being ignored. At Christmas this situation reaches a climax in the episode ""Santa Claus"" when Roseanne discovers that Darlene has a close friend who happens to be a woman Roseanne's age that owns a bookstore. Darlene apparently tells this woman everything about herself, even sharing some of her poems and short stories with her. Roseanne's hurt over the entire situation is very touching. Things do look up for Darlene eventually, as she finds a boyfriend and soulmate in the unlikeliest of candidates - David Healy, Mark's younger brother, who is the opposite of Mark in every way imaginable.Jackie's drifting comes to an abrupt end in ""Why Jackie Becomes a Trucker"" after she wakes up with Arnie after a night of drinking at the Lobo. Laurie Metcalf was at her very best in this episode, from her look of shock when Arnie exits her bathroom brushing his teeth, to her expression of embarrassment when she blurts out the news to Roseanne and her coworkers at Rodbell's, to her busily decontaminating her mattress and sheets at the end of the episode. If the whole episode had been entirely about this one night stand it might have been somewhat tiresome, but there is also a hilarious poker game between Dan and the guys in which Leon comes out to the group. One of Dan's friends, trying to break the uncomfortable silence caused by Leon's revelation, asks Leon if he knows his friend Bob in Chicago who shares Leon's sexual orientation. Leon's response is funny without being taunting - ""Oh of course, Bob in Chicago!"" - as though this is a secret society in which everyone knows everyone else.""Aliens"", the end of the season is bittersweet. After all the hard work and sacrifice, it becomes clear that the motorcycle shop is not going to make it. At the same time, Rodbell's is closing and Roseanne will be losing the income from that job too. The only bright spot is D.J. winning the spelling bee, so the whole family dresses up for the occasion of him being honored. For once D.J. is the center of attention, and it couldn't come at a more needed time. This episode also sees the end of Arnie and Nancy's brief marriage. Nancy has had it with Arnie when he leaves her a note saying he has been abducted by aliens. She considers this his way of copping out of admitting what his real reason for leaving is. However, Arnie actually has been abducted by aliens - a bizarre exit to a bizarre recurring character.I could talk at length about all of the episodes in this season since they were all very good, but suffice it to say that Season Four probably does the best job of combining great comedy, hard-hitting drama, and highlighting situations that should look familiar to any member of the middle class. Although this is not the last of the good seasons of Roseanne, I would say season four is the last of the golden years of that series, and definitely worth viewing.",5,The last of the Golden Years of

980909,A1B0GMD8Q8H8KQ,B000EZ908E,ck,"[1, 2]","The 4th season is when ""Roseanne"" really showed how good it could be. All the actors had developed their characters and were ready to show how funny they could be. Also the writing became much stronger compared to the 1st and 2nd seasons. I think Roseanne the actress had alot to do with keeping the show on a certain level of reality, since she says much of what happens in the show she pulls from her own life. I particularly liked the episode ""Darlene Fades to Black"" and how it shows what it's really like to be a parent. I'd say seasons 4,5 and 6 are the best. The rest have ups and downs but are still very good. Laurie Metcalf and Roseanne Barr are so talented. Laurie knows exactly how to deliver on comedic timing and use her face, tone and body all together. Roseanne has an amazing ability to be real, funny and original without ever looking like she is trying to act, it almost comes naturally. John Goodman is very talented, but I do think he tended to get overshadowed by the actresses sometimes.

I was more into this show by then and I remember how screamingly funny some episodes were, especially where Jackie 'fesses up to sleeping with Arnie, disgusting her girlfriends (and Roseanne too) bad enough to induce vomiting.  There's also Roseanne's needlebutt's remarks toward their new neighbor, Kathy ""ah-*kew*"" Bowman (remember her amusing sneezes?).  Darlene looking eerily like her real-life sister Melissa when the latter appeared on 'Little House on the Prairie' cuz according to Becky, she couldn't be dressed like death in the commercial.  Darlene being called Heidi by Dan upon pointing out his doofishness.  Roseanne being called Aunt Roseanne by Darlene after she was replaced by Jackie as being a more favorable respresentative of mothers for the commercial.  On what I'd say to be a very appropriate note, the cast wraps up this season with a food fight in the kitchen after returning home from DJ's spelling bee.  Funny!!!!

980920,A19JLMP0T6FNF5,B000EZ908E,M.C,"[11, 11]","I envy the person who has not seen this beloved classic.  Truly one of the all-time greatest shows ever made, Season 4 was when ""Roseanne"" reached the zeneth of creative perfection; an amazing feat, considering the first three seasons were spectacular.Many fans agree that seasons 4 and 5 contain the best set of episodes, not just for Roseanne, but for any sitcom period.  With 20-plus episodes in each season, it's shocking that there simply isn't even a single dud in the bunch.  EVERY single episode in seasons 4 and 5 play like mini-masterpieces, blending that trademark comedy and realistic drama like no other.  Enjoy!!!I was twelve years old when ""Roseanne"" came out, and vividly remember it having such a huge impact on my family, as well as society as a whole. For the first time, middle-class families could identify with characters on a sitcom, and enjoy real life issues and problems being handled with utmost care and realism.What made ""Roseanne"" unique was its utter lack of vanity, superficiality, and unrealistic idealism. In the age of ""The Cosby Show,"" and ""Family Ties,"" Roseanne stormed in as an overweight, screaming mother who didn't always keep her house clean, didn't pay the bills on time, didn't always have the answer, and didn't keep her sexuality hidden. From the very first episode, viewers got to see a messy house, screaming kids who don't always listen, and parents who struggle with money, menial jobs, and weight issues. Finally, a real family on television! Can you think of another show where the female lead walks around the house with an xxx-large bright pink bathrobe, rollers in her hair, and can still be taken seriously? Whatever you might think of Roseanne personally (in terms of her public behavior), she never let it effect the quality of the show. The show benefited from WONDERFUL writing, a fantastic cast, and a pitch-perfect blend of comedy and drama. The show had some incredibly funny moments, combined with profoundly touching scenes that really played well on television; the show was never sappy, and stayed true to life. In my opinion, virtually every episode during seasons one through six, with rare exceptions, played out like thirty minute masterpieces. By seasons three and four, the show had reached perfection.Roseanne acted her heart out on this show, and got better every year. She could always deliver a sarcastic one-liner like no other, but as the show progressed she managed the dramatic scenes with perfect accuracy. She managed to infuse her strong, sarcastic exterior with an incredible dose of heart and generosity. John Goodman had exceptional chemistry with Roseanne, and turned Dan into a hard-working, loving father that we all wish we could have. Laurie Metcalf's Jackie was, perhaps, the shows most complex character, and, in my opinion, the best actor of them all. She could take even mundane lines and turn them into hysterical comedy. Metcalf turned Jackie into a cool, sympathetic character you always wanted around. The sister relationship between Roseanne and Jackie was perhaps the most realistic ever portrayed on TV.The kids of the show were also exceptional. I remember watching Darlene when I was a kid/teenager, and thinking ""finally, a realistic depiction of a teenager."" The iconic Darlene was a tomboy, depressed at times, and certainly not your typical happy, popular, beautifully perfect character. She had many challenges, emotions, and Gilbert pulled them all off with complete ease. Darlene was a hero to anybody who felt like they didn't fit in. Becky was the whiny, spoiled brat of the bunch, played beautifully by Lecy Garonson; she never hit a false note. Sarah Chalke, on the other hand, was sub par, and really should never have been cast as a replacement. Even DJ, the youngest of the bunch, had some incredible one-liners, and managed to be completely real.Overall, this show goes down as a masterpiece; it's exactly what a TV show should be: Hysterically funny, profound, insightful, relevant, and, above all, completely entertaining.",5,A PERFECT season of one TV's GREATEST shows!!,1334361600,"04 14, 2012",2012,4045,"['envy', 'person', 'who', 'not', 'seen', 'beloved', 'classic', 'Truly', 'one', 'all-time', 'greatest', 'shows', 'ever', 'made', 'Season', '4', 'was', 'when', 'Roseanne', 'reached', 'zeneth', 'creative', 'perfection', 'amazing', 'feat', 'considering', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'were', 'spectacular.Many', 'fans', 'agree', 'seasons', '4', '5', 'contain', 'best', 'set', 'episodes', 'not', 'just', 'Roseanne', 'sitcom', 'period', '20-plus', 'episodes', 'season', 'shocking', 'simply', ""n't"", 'even', 'single', 'dud', 'bunch', 'EVERY', 'single', 'episode', 'seasons', '4', '5', 'play', 'mini-masterpieces', 'blending', 'trademark', 'comedy', 'realistic', 'drama', 'other', 'Enjoy', 'was', 'twelve', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'Roseanne', 'came', 'out', 'vividly', 'remember', 'having', 'such', 'huge', 'impact', 'family', 'as', 'well', 'as', 'society', 'whole', 'first', 'time', 'middle-class', 'families', 'could', 'identify', 'characters', 'sitcom', 'enjoy', 'real', 'life', 'issues', 'problems', 'being', 'handled', 'utmost', 'care', 'realism.What', 'made', 'Roseanne', 'unique', 'was', 'utter', 'lack', 'vanity', 'superficiality', 'unrealistic', 'idealism', 'age', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'Family', 'Ties', 'Roseanne', 'stormed', 'overweight', 'screaming', 'mother', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'always', 'keep', 'house', 'clean', 'did', ""n't"", 'pay', 'bills', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'always', 'have', 'answer', 'did', ""n't"", 'keep', 'sexuality', 'hidden', 'very', 'first', 'episode', 'viewers', 'got', 'see', 'messy', 'house', 'screaming', 'kids', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'listen', 'parents', 'who', 'struggle', 'money', 'menial', 'jobs', 'weight', 'issues', 'Finally', 'real', 'family', 'television', 'Can', 'think', 'show', 'where', 'female', 'lead', 'walks', 'house', 'xxx-large', 'bright', 'pink', 'bathrobe', 'rollers', 'hair', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'Whatever', 'might', 'think', 'Roseanne', 'personally', 'terms', 'public', 'behavior', 'never', 'let', 'effect', 'quality', 'show', 'show', 'benefited', 'WONDERFUL', 'writing', 'fantastic', 'cast', 'pitch-perfect', 'blend', 'comedy', 'drama', 'show', 'had', 'incredibly', 'funny', 'moments', 'combined', 'profoundly', 'touching', 'scenes', 'really', 'played', 'well', 'television', 'show', 'was', 'never', 'sappy', 'stayed', 'true', 'life', 'opinion', 'virtually', 'episode', 'seasons', 'one', 'six', 'rare', 'exceptions', 'played', 'out', 'thirty', 'minute', 'masterpieces', 'seasons', 'three', 'four', 'show', 'had', 'reached', 'perfection.Roseanne', 'acted', 'heart', 'out', 'show', 'got', 'better', 'year', 'could', 'always', 'deliver', 'sarcastic', 'one-liner', 'other', 'show', 'progressed', 'managed', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'perfect', 'accuracy', 'managed', 'infuse', 'strong', 'sarcastic', 'exterior', 'incredible', 'dose', 'heart', 'generosity', 'John', 'Goodman', 'had', 'exceptional', 'chemistry', 'Roseanne', 'turned', 'Dan', 'hard-working', 'loving', 'father', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'Laurie', 'Metcalf', 'Jackie', 'was', 'perhaps', 'shows', 'most', 'complex', 'character', 'opinion', 'best', 'actor', 'could', 'take', 'even', 'mundane', 'lines', 'turn', 'hysterical', 'comedy', 'Metcalf', 'turned', 'Jackie', 'cool', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'always', 'wanted', 'sister', 'relationship', 'Roseanne', 'Jackie', 'was', 'perhaps', 'most', 'realistic', 'ever', 'portrayed', 'TV.The', 'kids', 'show', 'were', 'also', 'exceptional', 'remember', 'watching', 'Darlene', 'when', 'was', 'kid/teenager', 'thinking', 'finally', 'realistic', 'depiction', 'teenager', 'iconic', 'Darlene', 'was', 'tomboy', 'depressed', 'times', 'certainly', 'not', 'typical', 'happy', 'popular', 'beautifully', 'perfect', 'character', 'had', 'many', 'challenges', 'emotions', 'Gilbert', 'pulled', 'off', 'complete', 'ease', 'Darlene', 'was', 'hero', 'anybody', 'who', 'felt', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'Becky', 'was', 'whiny', 'spoiled', 'brat', 'bunch', 'played', 'beautifully', 'Lecy', 'Garonson', 'never', 'hit', 'false', 'note', 'Sarah', 'Chalke', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'sub', 'par', 'really', 'should', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'cast', 'replacement', 'Even', 'DJ', 'youngest', 'bunch', 'had', 'incredible', 'one-liners', 'managed', 'be', 'completely', 'real.Overall', 'show', 'down', 'masterpiece', 'exactly', 'what', 'TV', 'show', 'should', 'be', 'Hysterically', 'funny', 'profound', 'insightful', 'relevant', 'completely', 'entertaining']",N/A

(Roseanne would finally win her only Best Actress-Comedy EMMY for season five; and John Goodman--shockingly--never won an EMMY for playing Dan Connor altho he was nominated seven years in a row!).FINALLY, for this fourth season set, there are at last commentaries by Roseanne! And even better, they are video-commentaries, which means you actually watch Roseanne live on the right-side of your TV screen as she watches and comments on the episode playing on the (larger) left side of your screen. The two episodes she comments on are TRICK ME UP TRICK ME DOWN (that season's Halloween episode, which also marked the final appearance of George Clooney as Booker--and Roseanne has some great, sharp comments on the fact that her series's writers didn't appreciate Clooney the way she did) and THANKSGIVING '91 (with guests Shelley WInters and Estelle Parsons). These are wonderful commentaries, very funny, very honest and Roseanne's comments are aided by some pop-up blurbs at the bottom of the screen that sometimes corrects or elaborates on something Roseanne has said. (For instance, Roseanne says Shelley Winters wasnt too happy about playing Parson's mother because she was only a few years older than Parsons. The pop-up track tells us that WInters was seven years older than Parsons.)The second extra is a brief on-camera interview with Roseanne about the show. It's spirited and fun and filled with clips. The final extra is called ""A Grown-Up Sit Down Interview with ""an Adult"" Becky and D.J. It's merely a condensed and reedited compilation of the interview Michael Fishman did for the season two set and the interview Lecky Goranson did for the season three set. It offers no new material and is just a rehash of previously seen footage.Even thought Roseanne ends each commentary track with the same statement of ""Am I done?"", I hope that the next sets have even more video commentaries. This is a terrific DVD set.",5,Video Commentaries on Season Five,1150675200,"06 19, 2006",2006,2062,"['Season', 'four', '1991-92', 'season', 'won', 'Laurie', 'Metcalf', 'first', 'three', 'consecutive', 'EMMY', 'Awards', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Comedic', 'Actress', 'Roseanne', 'would', 'finally', 'win', 'only', 'Best', 'Actress-Comedy', 'EMMY', 'season', 'five', 'John', 'Goodman', 'shockingly', 'never', 'won', 'EMMY', 'playing', 'Dan', 'Connor', 'was', 'nominated', 'seven', 'years', 'row', '.FINALLY', 'fourth', 'season', 'set', 'are', 'last', 'commentaries', 'Roseanne', 'even', 'better', 'are', 'video-commentaries', 'actually', 'watch', 'Roseanne', 'live', 'right-side', 'TV', 'screen', 'comments', 'episode', 'playing', 'larger', 'left', 'side', 'screen', 'two', 'episodes', 'comments', 'are', 'TRICK', 'ME', 'UP', 'TRICK', 'ME', 'DOWN', 'season', 'Halloween', 'episode', 'also', 'marked', 'final', 'appearance', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Booker', 'Roseanne', 'great', 'sharp', 'comments', 'fact', 'series', 'writers', 'did', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'Clooney', 'way', 'did', 'THANKSGIVING', ""'91"", 'guests', 'Shelley', 'WInters', 'Estelle', 'Parsons', 'are', 'wonderful', 'commentaries', 'very', 'funny', 'very', 'honest', 'Roseanne', 'comments', 'are', 'aided', 'pop-up', 'blurbs', 'bottom', 'screen', 'corrects', 'elaborates', 'something', 'Roseanne', 'said', 'instance', 'Roseanne', 'Shelley', 'Winters', 'wasnt', 'too', 'happy', 'playing', 'Parson', 'mother', 'was', 'only', 'few', 'years', 'older', 'Parsons', 'pop-up', 'track', 'WInters', 'was', 'seven', 'years', 'older', 'Parsons', 'second', 'extra', 'brief', 'on-camera', 'interview', 'Roseanne', 'show', 'spirited', 'fun', 'filled', 'clips', 'final', 'extra', 'called', 'Grown-Up', 'Sit', 'Down', 'Interview', 'Adult', 'Becky', 'D.J', 'merely', 'condensed', 'reedited', 'compilation', 'interview', 'Michael', 'Fishman', 'did', 'season', 'two', 'set', 'interview', 'Lecky', 'Goranson', 'did', 'season', 'three', 'set', 'new', 'material', 'just', 'rehash', 'previously', 'seen', 'footage.Even', 'thought', 'Roseanne', 'commentary', 'track', 'same', 'statement', 'Am', 'done', 'hope', 'next', 'sets', 'have', 'even', 'more', 'video', 'commentaries', 'terrific', 'DVD', 'set']",N/A
