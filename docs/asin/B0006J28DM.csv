If you enjoy her thought patterns and her indecision between ben and noel, this is a fun ending. Sometimes it's fun to go back to college with her. I personally never lived in a dorm, but this kinda lets you know what it was like, and also all the post-dorm, apartment living too.I'll also comment that I think everyone on the show did great acting. Scott Speedman's portrayal of Ben is the hottest pain-in-the-ass with a heart who repeated screws up. Its so easy to sympatize with Scott Foley's character, Noel, and get frustrated with him every single time. Sometimes Felicity drives me crazy, but you can understand how she arrived at different conclusions time and again. And may I also say, Javier always adds the much needed dose of comedy, and most of the time steals the show. I love felicity, and I thought it was an awesome show.",5,love it.,1127520000,"09 24, 2005",2005,985,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'felicity', 'countless', 'times', 'think', 'season', 'get', 'most', 'involved', '1st', '3rd', 'senior', 'year', 'was', 'good', 'enjoy', 'thought', 'patterns', 'indecision', 'ben', 'noel', 'fun', 'ending', 'Sometimes', 'fun', 'go', 'back', 'college', 'personally', 'never', 'lived', 'dorm', 'kinda', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'also', 'post-dorm', 'apartment', 'living', 'too.I', ""'ll"", 'also', 'comment', 'think', 'everyone', 'show', 'did', 'great', 'acting', 'Scott', 'Speedman', 'portrayal', 'Ben', 'hottest', 'pain-in-the-ass', 'heart', 'who', 'repeated', 'up', 'so', 'easy', 'sympatize', 'Scott', 'Foley', 'character', 'Noel', 'get', 'frustrated', 'single', 'time', 'Sometimes', 'Felicity', 'crazy', 'can', 'understand', 'how', 'arrived', 'different', 'conclusions', 'time', 'again', 'may', 'also', 'say', 'Javier', 'always', 'much', 'needed', 'dose', 'comedy', 'most', 'time', 'show', 'love', 'felicity', 'thought', 'was', 'awesome', 'show']",Felicity - Senior Year Collection The Complete Fourth Season

Why couldn't it continue? There are enough likeable characters that go on to do things after college. Life does go on after college.

Noel and Sean were out of college and were able to have great storylines.  Sorry that it had to end.

Premiering on the WB network in September 1998, the show (along with Dawson's Creek) helped ignite a firestorm of highly successful original series on behalf of the upstart network, with such hit shows as Angel (1999), Gilmore Girls (2000), and Smallville (2001). The brainchild of writer J.J. Abrams (creator of the two hit series Alias and Lost), Felicity follows the life of a recent high school graduate, not through seasons 1, 2, 3, and 4, but through Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, and Senior years. Similar in genre to its contemporary, Dawson's Creek, Felicity's cast is of approximately the same age, but the setting is college instead of high school...Felicity begins when the star of the series, Felicity Porter (Keri Russell), graduates from high school. Having harbored a four-year crush on classmate Ben Covington (Scott Speedman), despite the fact they've never talked, Felicity musters the courage in the aftermath of their commencement ceremony to ask him to sign her yearbook. When Ben writes some surprising comments, Felicity decides to follow him to fictional University of New York (UNY) instead of pursuing her goal of pre-med at Stanford. Against her parent's wishes, she enrolls in the school and moves cross country where she becomes roommates with Meghan Rotundi (Amanda Foreman), a girl whose lifestyle clashes with her own, and where she meets resident advisor Noel Crane (Scott Foley) who immediately develops a crush on her. When Ben learns of the true reason for Felicity's enrollment, he's both flattered and a little uncertain about Felicity's mental stability. In the ensuing four years, Felicity goes through the basic trials and travails of a maturing college student, experiencing the ups and downs of life, love, and adulthood...The Felicity (Season 4) DVD features a number of exciting episodes including the season premiere ""The Declaration"" in which the summer before Felicity's senior year is coming to an end. Felicity's father is putting a lot of pressure of Felicity to decide what she's going to do with her life and even goes so far as to accuse her of wasting her college years. Meanwhile, Ben has decided he wants to become a doctor, thus forcing him to spend at least one more year in school to satisfy the pre-med requirements. His contrasting attitude from that of Felicity drives a wedge between them, and Felicity begins spending more and more time with Noel... Other notable episodes from Season 4 include ""Oops... Noel Did It Again"" in which Ben must deal with the impending death of his father while Noel reveals the truth about his and Felicity's relationship, and ""Raising Arizona"" in which Ben decides to transfer to the University of Arizona in order to be near Lauren and his unborn child...Below is a list of episodes included on the Felicity (Season 4) DVD:Episode 63 (The Declaration)Episode 64 (My Best Friend's Wedding)Episode 65 (Your Money or Your Wife)Episode 66 (Miss Conception)Episode 67 (Boooz)Episode 68 (Oops...

He should have been way over Felicity and trying to hurt Ben by using Felicity against him. He wasn't as focused as he should have been in his life. However, this is the season where I fell the most in love with Ben's character. He gets more mature and more focused into what he wants. He finally finds a career choice and sticks with it. Felicity was a bit more selfish in the season because she wants to have her cake, eat it, and the ice cream. She's no longer the innocent lost girl, but she keeps acting like it which was kind of annoying. The ending episodes weren't really needed and confused the audience into wondering what the heck was going on. i would have loved to see how all the character's lives turned out after college besides the short clips with Noel getting married.

870384,A399W215YXYNOX,B0006J28DM,J. Toteda,"[58, 62]","If your looking for consistently amazing acting, then ""Felicity"" is the show for you. Sadly the fourth was the last season of ""Felicity"" and thus the graduating season. Nonetheless, many fans would have loved to see Felicity's life unfold outside of collage. This season of Felicity deals with the hardships of commitment. Many characters this season deal commitment issues, such as relationships, education, and with following a particular career path. Most viewers would assume that by now Felicity would know exactly what it is that she's meant to do, and who she is meant to be with, however this is not the case. No show has come closer to displaying this sense of regret and uncertainty as ""Felicity"" does this season. Just because we get older doesn't mean we know everything. Felicity's confidence has grown with each passing season, but much of her season one and two uncertainties come back to haut her. So just when you the viewers think they know her, she does something completely out of character. It keeps the show interesting, and along with the funny and charismatic cast, this show deserves much praise.Because Felicity was only signed on for 17 episodes this season, like season three, the writers and directors wanted to make sure that the fans got their graduation episode. However, the show was picked-up for another five episodes. Because of this, the writers decided on a neat twist, and unrealistic twist of Felicity going back in time. Many complained of the unrealistic direction this took, others like myself enjoyed the lightness and comedy that these episodes portrayed. It was a nice change from the dramatic, and often melancholic undertone of the first 17 episodes. My piece of advice is to have fun with these 'extra' episodes and not dissect every piece of inconsistency, it was meant to be 'far reaching'. In the end, something may be learned from all this silliness, that no matter how much you may think you could have done better, or changed things for the better, on the grand scheme of things it doesn't really matter, because you're always where you're suppose to be, and who you want to be with is a decision you must make considering where you've been, and everything you've overcome- together.Also, we are spoiled with another spectacular quest appearance from John Ritter, ""Ben's father"". He and Scott Speedman share many touching scenes.Lastly, I came across a quote from a ""Felicity"" Website ([...]) that sums up why so many people love this show:""I think the reason that so many people love the show is because it mirrors our own lives at times. Although our circumstances may not be the same, we can appreciate the emotions and situations of the characters.

870386,A1CAA0683A5MLQ,B0006J28DM,Lavender Brown,"[2, 3]","I have been trying to get through the Felicity series for about 5 or so years now. When the show was actually airing, ratings dropped in season two (they moved the show to Sunday nights) and they blamed the drop because of the Felicity character's seriously chopped haircut.Despite the wonderful cast and an awesome first season, I think the rating's are due to some of the annoying character's on the show (Julie in particular) as well as the overly used and whispered (?) ""hey's"" and ""hi's."" On the slightly-even more-annoying side, two questions are used in EVERY episode...""can I ask you something?"" and ""can I talk to you for a second?"" The predictable characters (Sean is currently working on an invention, Meghan is casting a spell in her ugly black clothes, Elena is studying yet again, Julie is crying yet again) do nothing to help this show gain viewers.But the true pitfall of the series is the despicable love triangle between Noel, Felicity and Ben (pictured above). Noel and Felicity are best friends, they have fun together, they ""click"" with each other and Noel spends most of the series pining for her. This causes Noel to look pathetic, like a sad little puppy following her around. Don't get me wrong, he has his ""oh, I love Noel"" moments but for the most part he is just annoying and in the way. Ben on the other hand is a little more independent...sometimes a little too much which always causes trouble between him and Felicity. Ben went through a period where he was without substance, a little too ho-hum and to be honest, flat out boring. It seemed the longer his hair got, the more lame he became. In the end, you just wanted her to pick a guy-which one? Who cares! Just choose one already!The poor series held on and deemed itself worthy of watching but became a depressing mess in the last season (season 4). It has taken great dedication, and tolerance, to finish this series. I look forward to seeing these actors in more creative, less rediculous/predictable roles. 2/5 stars... for the effort...",2,Terrible Season!,1338940800,"06 6, 2012",2012,2027,"['have', 'been', 'trying', 'get', 'Felicity', 'series', '5', 'so', 'years', 'now', 'When', 'show', 'was', 'actually', 'airing', 'ratings', 'dropped', 'season', 'two', 'moved', 'show', 'Sunday', 'nights', 'blamed', 'drop', 'Felicity', 'character', 'seriously', 'chopped', 'haircut.Despite', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'awesome', 'first', 'season', 'think', 'rating', 'are', 'due', 'annoying', 'character', 'show', 'Julie', 'particular', 'as', 'well', 'overly', 'used', 'whispered', 'hey', 'hi', 'slightly-even', 'more-annoying', 'side', 'two', 'questions', 'are', 'used', 'EVERY', 'episode', 'can', 'ask', 'something', 'can', 'talk', 'second', 'predictable', 'characters', 'Sean', 'currently', 'working', 'invention', 'Meghan', 'casting', 'spell', 'ugly', 'black', 'clothes', 'Elena', 'studying', 'yet', 'again', 'Julie', 'crying', 'yet', 'again', 'do', 'nothing', 'help', 'show', 'gain', 'true', 'pitfall', 'series', 'despicable', 'love', 'triangle', 'Noel', 'Felicity', 'Ben', 'pictured', 'Noel', 'Felicity', 'are', 'best', 'friends', 'have', 'fun', 'together', 'click', 'other', 'Noel', 'most', 'series', 'pining', 'Noel', 'look', 'pathetic', 'sad', 'little', 'puppy', 'following', 'around', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'oh', 'love', 'Noel', 'moments', 'most', 'part', 'just', 'annoying', 'way', 'Ben', 'other', 'hand', 'little', 'more', 'independent', 'sometimes', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'always', 'trouble', 'Felicity', 'Ben', 'went', 'period', 'where', 'was', 'substance', 'little', 'too', 'ho-hum', 'be', 'honest', 'flat', 'out', 'boring', 'seemed', 'longer', 'hair', 'got', 'more', 'lame', 'became', 'end', 'just', 'wanted', 'pick', 'guy-which', 'one', 'Who', 'Just', 'choose', 'one', 'already', 'poor', 'series', 'held', 'deemed', 'worthy', 'watching', 'became', 'depressing', 'mess', 'last', 'season', 'season', '4', 'taken', 'great', 'dedication', 'tolerance', 'finish', 'series', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'actors', 'more', 'creative', 'less', 'rediculous/predictable', 'roles', '2/5', 'stars', 'effort']",Felicity - Senior Year Collection The Complete Fourth Season
870387,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0006J28DM,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[15, 19]","After ""Felicity"" had filmed its ""final"" episode, ""The Graduate,"" whatever show was suppose to replace it in the WB's lineup quickly tanked and the network requested another five episodes from creators J.J. Abrams and Matt Reeves.  Their exercise in retroactive self-reflexivity almost redeems the final season, but having Felicity end up with Ben not once, but twice, is just adding insult to injury as far as I am concerned.  For me the point where the show threatened to jump the shark was not when Keri Russell cut her hair but when Felicity chose Ben over Noel, so when we stopped getting the WB on our cable system I forgot about ""Felicity"" and worried about getting copies of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" on tape.  I caught the endings of this fourth season when they original aired and now with ""Felicity: Senior Year Collection"" on DVD, I can see what I missed.The major premise of the fourth season can be reduced to the idea that while Felicity (Russell) and Ben (Scott Speedman) are going to end up together no matter what, they should make the ""no matter what"" part as complicated as possible.  If Felicity's concern about being admitted to the college's honors art program puts Ben's plan of becoming a doctor in danger is not enough to derail them (""The Declaration""), then maybe Felicity having sex with Noel will do it (""My Best Friend's Wedding"").  It is not a true episode of Felicity if we do not get to the point where Ben is not talking to Felicity and she insists on talking anyway (e.g., ""The Last Thanksgiving"").  It is not enough that Felicity have a pregnancy scare (""Miss Conception""), because it is even more fun if Ben spends a night with another woman during one of his fights with Felicity and the other woman shows up pregnant (""Future Shock"").  When Meghan's sister shows up pregnant (""Fire"") your first impulse is to point a finger at Ben.This all underscores what I realized when I watched ""Felicity: Sophomore Year Collection,"" which is that I watch ""Felicity"" despite the title character and not because of her.  While Felicity and Ben go through their revolving door relationship the other characters become more important.  The one-note couple of Elena (Tangi Miller) and Tracy (Donald Adeosun Faison) finally get to the wedding day (""My Best Friend's Wedding""), at which point we get to forget about them and pay more attention to Meghan (Amanda Foreman) and Shawn (Greg Grunberg), a.k.a. Shmeghan, who are much more interesting, especially once their parental units become involved (""Your Money or Your Wife"").  Even Ben's troubled relationship with his father (John Ritter) becomes more interesting than his roller coaster with Felicity (""Oops...Noel Did It Again"").  But my favorite part of this fourth season is when they decide that the comedy team should be Meghan and Javier (Ian Gomez) who end up taking drama together (""Future Shock"").  Meanwhile, Shawn and Noel (Scott Foley), become partners in the computer graphics business (""A Perfect Match""), which is good because Noel has been suffering from depression (""Moving On"").  Lord knows the man has reason.All I can say is that if Felicity was one of my students she would have failed for the stunt she pulls with that paper (""The Paper Chase""), and then everybody would have graduated except Felicity, as irony would have ruled supreme.  But Felicity gets her diploma (""The Graduate"") and then makes a decision concerning her future education that pretty much makes the four years she spent at NYU an absolute wash.  I was going to say a farce, but they save that for the last five episodes when the producers had to come up with a creative way of telling more stories after the series has reached its natural climax.The idea that Felicity would go back in time to rectify her mistake and choose Noel instead of Ben was just the sort of thing to get my heart pumping again.  It was like the heavens had opened up and a shaft of light had descended on Felicity along with that all-important dollar that would allow her to buy a clue.  Hit with a pair of tragedies, Felicity confesses to Meghan that the biggest mistake of her life was not picking Noel (as opposed to following Ben to New York so she could not be a doctor).  Noel is about to get married so the only intelligent thing to do is for Meghan to use a spell to send Felicity back in time to the start of their senior year (""Time Will Tell"").  Of course, since there are four more episodes to go and living happily ever after is not that interesting dramatically, trying to fix her own troubled life causes some major problems for the rest of the gang.All the birds come home to roost during this mini-story arc, including both Julie (Amy Jo Johnson) and Hannah (Jennifer Garner), as Felicity undoes everyone's past.  When we get to the point where Ben and Noel are both convinced that Felicity needs psychiatric help (""Felicity Interrupted""), the show turns really dark.  Unfortunately, most of the final ""final"" episode (""Back to the Future"") is a clip show done in the context of Felicity talking to Korsikoff (Kurt Fuller), the man who wrote the book from which Meghan got the time travel spell.  The shift in tone does not work for me, and given that this was so much of a clip show I find it hard to believe they had to cut the deleted Elena scenes that appear in the special features on Disc 6.  On the plus side, the show does end on a happy note for Noel and I can cherish that idea while reminding myself that I never need suffer through Ben and Felicity not talking ever again.  This is what happens when you like ""Felicity"" more than Felicity.",4,"Felicity Porter graduates, but did she LEARN anything?",1111708800,"03 25, 2005",2005,5613,"['Felicity', 'had', 'filmed',

870391,A1KY8IAFV4P1GZ,B0006J28DM,Miles W. Mathis,"[18, 19]","I am a big Felicity fan, but the Senior Year really hit a terrible wall.  One of the creators admitted in interviews later that he had already moved on to Alias, and it shows.  This is a mess.  He and all the producers and writers should be ashamed to have let their fine project peter out like this.  The scripts no longer make any sense.  Characters act out-of-character, many things go unexplained, plotlines are dropped right and left, minor characters are played by the same person, and so on.  Apparently, people at NYU have multiple jobs, working in the mailroom one month and in counseling the next, working in the health center one month and in the library the next.  The producers can't even take the time to hire separate people to play these parts.  But the worst is having Felicity copy her final paper and then be allowed to graduate.  This after they had a show about cheating in season 2, making it a very big deal.  Now, suddenly, there are no consequences.  It is apparently OK to plagiarize papers and throw library books in the garbage and steal dissertations.  I am not being a moralist here, I am just pointing out that all this completely goes against Felicity's character, a character developed over three long seasons.  The Senior Year has many similar examples, which show that the new writers could not even be bothered to become familiar with the previous material.

But the contents of the final season, I felt, were wanting. I would give the final season 4 stars because even when this series hit low points, it was still better than many other shows on TV at the time.I watched Felicity from the very first episode. I liked the show because it felt very real. Felicity's friends were the kind of people one meets in real life. They were not overdone or over explained. The conversations did not feel forced or complicated, they were very natural. That's why I had such a problem buying the fantasy sequence at the end of the show. I didn't have a problem with the B&W; 1950's episode in Season 2, in fact, it's one of my favorites. I liked this one because it was an acting experiment, it did not interfere with the series' story line, it just used it as a setup and showed off the actors' range.On the other hand, the split fantasy sequence felt like a desperate attempt to satisfy viewers like myself who felt Noel had been short-changed.

870395,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0006J28DM,Robert Moore,"[1, 1]","FELICITY ends where it should have ended, with Felicity's graduation from college.  Well, her graduation with a bit of an alternative-reality twist.  But as a fan of Philip K. Dick I'm completely at ease with that.  Twist or no twist, FELICITY ended by being with no serious competition the finest show about being a college student ever made.  Although two other series were overall much better shows -- BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER and VERONICA MARS -- neither did as good a job of dealing with college life; in both instances they remained great series despite the dip in quality created by the college setting.  Although the final two seasons of FELICITY were not as strong as the first two, it nonetheless remained consistently fascinating.Season Four -- like the first three seasons -- focused on Felicity Porter's relationships with Ben and Noel.  As in each previous season those relationships were complicated by bad decisions or misunderstandings on the parts of the various individuals involved.  The major event of this season comes early on, as a depressed Felicity in a moment of weakness sleeps with Noel on the top of the building Ben and Noel live in with Sean and Meghan.  There is no short-term fall out from this, but when Noel tells Ben about this in a moment of weakness, all hell breaks lose.  Things are patched up, but something remains broken in Ben and Felicity's relationship.  There are many other events in the season, from the near death of Ben's dad to his sexual encounter with an older woman during the time when he and Felicity were broken up resulting in her becoming pregnant with Ben's child.  But the expected end of the series comes to a close with Ben and Felicity at Stanford, where he cheats on her.This is where the series takes an unexpected and uncharacteristic twist.  Felicity, deeply regretting all the events following her infidelity with Noel, laments the course of her life to Meghan, who in turns attempts her most sophisticated spell yet, a reversal of time.  Felicity wakes to a time before the night that she slept with Noel.  But redoing her life does not go anywhere near as smoothly as she had hoped.  Suffice it to say that the author of the spell that Meghan cast undertakes a new spell, sending her back into the future.  Once back, she forgives Ben his own infidelity and -- as the series draws to a close -- they apparently patch everything up for good.  My major complaint with the series finale is that it was essentially a clip show.  A substantial portion of that final episode was footage from other episodes.  Fans of the show surely deserved better than that.  That being said, at least it was a better than normal clip show.And so FELICITY comes to an end.  It remained a strong show from beginning to end, though there are multiple signs of unwanted and unhelpful network interference.  Still, we are lucky that the show managed to get all the way through the four years it took Felicity to make her way all the way through college.  Hopefully we will someday get another first rate show about going to college.  If we don't, at least we have FELICITY.",4,Another strong season for a very nice show,1218326400,"08 10, 2008",2008,3121,"['FELICITY', 'where', 'should', 'have', 'ended', 'Felicity', 'graduation', 'college', 'Well', 'graduation', 'bit', 'alternative-reality', 'twist', 'fan', 'Philip', 'K.', 'Dick', ""'m"", 'completely', 'ease', 'Twist', 'twist', 'FELICITY', 'ended', 'being', 'serious', 'competition', 'finest', 'show', 'being', 'college', 'student', 'ever', 'made', 'two', 'other', 'series', 'were', 'overall', 'much', 'better', 'shows', 'THE', 'VAMPIRE', 'SLAYER', 'VERONICA', 'MARS', 'neither', 'did', 'as', 'good', 'job', 'dealing', 'college', 'life', 'instances', 'remained', 'great', 'series', 'dip', 'quality', 'created', 'college', 'setting', 'final', 'two', 'seasons', 'FELICITY', 'were', 'not', 'as', 'strong', 'first', 'two', 'nonetheless', 'remained', 'consistently', 'fascinating.Season', 'Four', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'focused', 'Felicity', 'Porter', 'relationships', 'Ben', 'Noel', 'previous', 'season', 'relationships', 'were', 'complicated', 'bad', 'decisions', 'misunderstandings', 'parts', 'various', 'individuals', 'involved', 'major', 'event', 'season', 'early', 'depressed', 'Felicity', 'moment', 'weakness', 'sleeps', 'Noel', 'top', 'building', 'Ben', 'Noel', 'live', 'Sean', 'Meghan', 'short-term', 'fall', 'when', 'Noel', 'Ben', 'moment', 'weakness', 'hell', 'breaks', 'lose', 'Things', 'are', 'patched', 'up', 'something', 'broken', 'Ben', 'Felicity', 'relationship', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'events', 'season', 'near', 'death', 'Ben', 'dad', 'sexual', 'encounter', 'older', 'woman', 'time', 'when', 'Felicity', 'were', 'broken', 'up', 'resulting', 'becoming', 'pregnant', 'Ben', 'child', 'expected', 'end', 'series', 'close', 'Ben', 'Felicity', 'Stanford', 'where', 'her.This', 'where', 'series', 'unexpected', 'uncharacteristic', 'twist', 'Felicity', 'deeply', 'regretting', 'events', 'following', 'infidelity', 'Noel', 'course', 'life', 'Meghan', 'who', 'turns', 'attempts', 'most', 'sophisticated', 'spell', 'yet', 'reversal', 'time', 'Felicity', 'time', 'night', 'slept', 'Noel', 'redoing', 'life', 'not', 'go', 'anywhere', 'near', 'as', 'smoothly', 'had', 'hoped', 'Suffice', 'say', 'author', 'spell', 'Meghan', 'cast', 'undertakes', 'new', 'spell', 'sending', 'back', 'future', 'Once', 'back', 'Ben', 'own', 'infidelity', 'series', 'close', 'apparently', 'patch', 'everything', 'up', 'good', 'major', 'complaint', 'series', 'finale', 'was', 'essentially', 'clip', 'show', 'substantial', 'portion', 'final', 'episode', 'was', 'footage', 'other', 'episodes', 'Fans', 'show', 'surely', 'deserved', 'better', 'being', 'said', 'least', 'was', 'better', 'normal', 'clip', 'show.And', 'so', 'FELICITY', 'end', 'remained', 'strong', 'show', 'beginning', 'end', 'are', 'multiple', 'signs', 'unwanted', 'unhelpful', 'network', 'interference', 'Still', 'are', 'lucky', 'show', 'managed', 'get', 'way', 'four', 'years', 'took', 'Felicity', 'make', 'way', 'way', 'college', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'someday', 'get', 'first', 'rate', 'show', 'going', 'college', 'do', ""n't"", 'least', 'have', 'FELICITY']",Felicity - Senior Year Collection The Complete Fourth Season

870397,A2CZXIEBCR4YCY,B0006J28DM,The Opinionista,"[9, 10]","I am a huge Felicity fan.  I have loved and will always love this series.  I do not normally write reviews, but I just finished a 3-night marathon of watching this final season.  Do not read any more if you don't want to know what happens.I was at first skeptical about the time-travel storyline, but found that it brought a much-needed lightness to the show which was very heavy in this final season.This is where I have my main complaint.  Felicity and Ben were facing very difficult times due to her insecurity about the future and Ben's dad illness (by the way, an outstanding dramatic performance by John Ritter).  The added sub-plot with Lauren's pregnancy and Ben becoming a father, was too much.  For me, this was the element that spoiled this series from being perfect.  I don't think they really needed to include this in the show, for many reasons, but mostly because in our dream world it would have been nice to imagine what the show could not give us, their life after college.  It would have been nice to imagine Felicity and Ben getting married, and experiencing the joys of parenthood together and for the first time for both.  For me, this sub-plot is a dark cloud that will stay with them forever.Another problem with the show is the final episode's  omission of the scenes which explain how Elena is present at Noel's wedding after we know she dies.  Before seeing the bonus material, I thought it was her spirit, even though I could not explain Tracy's presence.  This was a huge thing, and it was very disappointing to see the creators explain that they had to cut out some scenes from the last show because it was too long; when they used many clips from previous shows that we did not need to see again.  This said, I was glad for this twist.  I was glad to have Elena alive again.In any case, this was one of the best series on television.  In my perfect world I dream with Felicity Again...a new series five or ten years after graduation.  A new Thirtysomething with the whole cast.  J.J.
