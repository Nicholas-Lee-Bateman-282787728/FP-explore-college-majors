1282615,A1IROAQI1F1PK9,B002P8LKBS,"E. Parker ""pushbuttonkitty""","[11, 15]","There are definite pros and cons to this disc.  I wish I had rented it before buying it.  I was looking for something that offered short morning and evening routines because I don't always have time to do a full yoga set, and ten minutes can make all the difference between a good day and/or a good night's sleep!The problem I run into is that I'm not a yoga beginner, but I'm revisiting it after many years of being away.  It is hard for me to find a disc that meets my needs because I want a short routine for workdays, and I want something that's not too challenging because I have to work back up to that, but I don't need my hand held through the whole set, either.The tutorial is good.  If you've never done any yoga at all, it is a great intro.  I'd suggest watching her teach the move, then rewind and do the move with her, and repeat for each new pose she teaches.The AM routine... ok, I like all the poses they use, and the flow is good.  The instructor, Billy, I just can't take him seriously.  He keeps making all these noises like the dessert scene from 'When Harry Met Sally' and instead of breathing I wind up giggling.  It's hard to keep your balance in a tree pose when you're trying not to laugh your @ss off!  I think a little more time could have been granted to the final meditation at the end of the routine.  I know it's only ten minutes, but I could have spent a little less time in the chair pose and a little more time reflecting on my upcoming day.  That might just be personal preference.The PM routine I do like.  I think the instructor is great, and the series has a great flow to it.  I have two complaints.  One- there's way too much talking.  When you're trying to relax and get ready for sleep, your mind can be distracted by the verbal onslaught.  Yes, it is for beginners and they do need instruction, but it would be okay to walk people through the first time doing the pose then let them do it on their own with minimal speech through the second repeat of the pose, third, and so on... My second complaint is that not enough time is spent in the final resting pose.  It would have benefited greatly with taking a ten minute session, turning it into a twelve minute session, and adding those two minutes into the final resting pose.  Again, the instructor speaks through the whole pose!  How can I relax when I'm listening to this chick talk?  She does need to walk people through sending the breath into each part of their body, but then even thirty seconds of silent deep breathing in the pose would be so beneficial!Final thoughts, I really like the routines, I really don't like all the talking.  Good production values, no cheesy music, definitely a good pick for a total amateur with no experience.  I just wish I could turn off the dialogue and just have a chime ring when I need to switch poses.  I can't really mute the TV and have my head turned toward the screen while I'm in downward facing dog or anything. I guess you have to take the bitter with the sweet.  I do still use this DVD, only the PM portion, when I don't have time for my other, longer DVD.  I pretty much gave up on the AM set from this one.",3,"Great for beginners, but lots of talking!",1274313600,"05 20, 2010",2010,3156,"['are', 'definite', 'pros', 'cons', 'disc', 'wish', 'had', 'rented', 'buying', 'was', 'looking', 'something', 'offered', 'short', 'morning', 'evening', 'routines', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'have', 'time', 'do', 'full', 'yoga', 'set', 'ten', 'minutes', 'can', 'make', 'difference', 'good', 'day', 'good', 'night', 'sleep', 'problem', 'run', ""'m"", 'not', 'yoga', 'beginner', ""'m"", 'revisiting', 'many', 'years', 'being', 'away', 'hard', 'find', 'disc', 'needs', 'want', 'short', 'routine', 'workdays', 'want', 'something', 'not', 'too', 'challenging', 'have', 'work', 'back', 'up', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'hand', 'held', 'whole', 'set', 'either.The', 'tutorial', 'good', ""'ve"", 'never', 'done', 'yoga', 'great', 'intro', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'watching', 'teach', 'move', 'then', 'rewind', 'do', 'move', 'repeat', 'new', 'pose', 'teaches.The', 'AM', 'routine', 'ok', 'like', 'poses', 'use', 'flow', 'good', 'instructor', 'Billy', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'seriously', 'making', 'noises', 'dessert', 'scene', ""'When"", 'Harry', 'Met', 'Sally', 'instead', 'breathing', 'wind', 'up', 'giggling', 'hard', 'keep', 'balance', 'tree', 'pose', 'when', ""'re"", 'trying', 'not', 'laugh', '@', 'ss', 'think', 'little', 'more', 'time', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'granted', 'final', 'meditation', 'end', 'routine', 'know', 'only', 'ten', 'minutes', 'could', 'have', 'spent', 'little', 'less', 'time', 'chair', 'pose', 'little', 'more', 'time', 'reflecting', 'upcoming', 'day', 'might', 'just', 'be', 'personal', 'preference.The', 'PM', 'routine', 'do', 'think', 'instructor', 'great', 'series', 'great', 'flow', 'have', 'two', 'complaints', 'One-', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'talking', 'When', ""'re"", 'trying', 'relax', 'get', 'ready', 'sleep', 'mind', 'can', 'be', 'distracted', 'verbal', 'onslaught', 'Yes', 'beginners', 'do', 'instruction', 'would', 'be', 'okay', 'walk', 'people', 'first', 'time', 'doing', 'pose', 'then', 'let', 'do', 'own', 'minimal', 'speech', 'second', 'repeat', 'pose', 'third', 'so', 'second', 'complaint', 'not', 'enough', 'time', 'spent', 'final', 'resting', 'pose', 'would', 'have', 'benefited', 'greatly', 'taking', 'ten', 'minute', 'session', 'turning', 'twelve', 'minute', 'session', 'adding', 'two', 'minutes', 'final', 'resting', 'pose', 'Again', 'instructor', 'whole', 'pose', 'How', 'can', 'relax', 'when', ""'m"", 'listening', 'chick', 'talk', 'need', 'walk', 'people', 'sending', 'breath', 'part', 'body', 'then', 'even', 'thirty', 'seconds', 'silent', 'deep', 'breathing', 'pose', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'beneficial', 'Final', 'thoughts', 'really', 'routines', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'talking', 'Good', 'production', 'values', 'cheesy', 'music', 'definitely', 'good', 'pick', 'total', 'amateur', 'experience', 'just', 'wish', 'could', 'turn', 'off', 'dialogue', 'just', 'have', 'chime', 'ring', 'when', 'need', 'switch', 'poses', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'mute', 'TV', 'have', 'head', 'turned', 'screen', ""'m"", 'downward', 'facing', 'dog', 'anything', 'guess', 'have', 'take', 'bitter', 'sweet', 'do', 'still', 'use', 'DVD', 'only', 'PM', 'portion', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'other', 'longer', 'DVD', 'pretty', 'much', 'gave', 'up', 'AM', 'set', 'one']",N/A

They had free workouts on there for a limited time and the instructor in that workout was the same one that is on this CD. Towards the end of the workout, they made mention that we could purchase the workout CD and that is what we did. We've used it dozens of times and like to do the workouts from the comforts of our own home. I recommend this for anyone that only has 15-40 minutes a day to do a yoga. This isn't just for beginners in my opinion. There is a workout for waking up the body, for winding down in the evening, and a great 40 minute workout that I really like. I recommend this to everyone.",5,Great yoga workout!,1352678400,"11 12, 2012",2012,682,"['Hello', 'wife', 'first', 'got', 'exposure', 'yoga', 'Comcast', 'on-demand', 'had', 'free', 'workouts', 'limited', 'time', 'instructor', 'workout', 'was', 'same', 'one', 'CD', 'end', 'workout', 'made', 'mention', 'could', 'purchase', 'workout', 'CD', 'what', 'did', ""'ve"", 'used', 'times', 'do', 'workouts', 'comforts', 'own', 'home', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'only', '15-40', 'minutes', 'day', 'do', 'yoga', ""n't"", 'just', 'beginners', 'opinion', 'workout', 'waking', 'up', 'body', 'winding', 'down', 'evening', 'great', '40', 'minute', 'workout', 'really', 'recommend', 'everyone']",N/A

My favorite is the AM routine. I can do it in my PJs, and it really does build heat in the muscles and help me wake up. It involves stretching your arms, legs and back. Plus a few sun salutations, chair pose, tree pose, and cat/cow. The PM routine really is relaxing and I am ready to hop in bed right afterwards. I like that it keeps the harder poses to a minimum and really focuses on calming the mind and body. The instructor walks you thru a few minutes of corpse pose and her voice is so soothing it almost puts me to sleep.The 45 minute routine walks you through the poses they use in the AM and PM routines plus some more and is a good introduction to yoga. I use it when I have some extra time and want to get in a workout without sweating too bad. I always feel wonderful afterwards.I would suggest this video for people starting out with yoga or for people looking for a basic and quick AM/PM yoga workout.",4,Lovely way to wake up and to end the day.,1391472000,"02 4, 2014",2014,1046,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'using', 'DVD', 'little', 'over', 'year', 'now', 'love', 'it.I', 'love', 'AM/PM', 'portions', 'DVD', '10', 'quick', 'minutes', 'favorite', 'AM', 'routine', 'can', 'do', 'PJs', 'really', 'build', 'heat', 'muscles', 'help', 'wake', 'up', 'stretching', 'arms', 'legs', 'back', 'few', 'sun', 'salutations', 'chair', 'pose', 'tree', 'pose', 'cat/cow', 'PM', 'routine', 'really', 'relaxing', 'am', 'ready', 'hop', 'bed', 'right', 'afterwards', 'harder', 'minimum', 'really', 'focuses', 'calming', 'mind', 'body', 'instructor', 'thru', 'few', 'minutes', 'corpse', 'pose', 'voice', 'so', 'soothing', 'almost', 'sleep.The', '45', 'minute', 'routine', 'walks', 'poses', 'use', 'AM', 'PM', 'routines', 'more', 'good', 'introduction', 'yoga', 'use', 'when', 'have', 'extra', 'time', 'want', 'get', 'workout', 'sweating', 'too', 'bad', 'always', 'feel', 'wonderful', 'afterwards.I', 'would', 'suggest', 'video', 'people', 'starting', 'out', 'yoga', 'people', 'looking', 'basic', 'quick', 'AM/PM', 'yoga', 'workout']",N/A

I could not even find info on the yogaworks site.Patty's teaching style -She does tell you always when to inhale/exhale which is great, she tells you what areas each pose strengthens, she gives good postural instructions on how to do the poses correctly, but her teaching style & voice is the style of an aerobics or toning gym class. Her voice is not soothing, I believe she doesn't always give the Sanskrit names of the poses, nor uses terms that are more aligned with traditional teaching like Rodney Yee, etc. This style has a more watered-down, Western style which many people do like, but not myself. Adding to that that this is hatha style to the point you will be standing waiting in between each pose while she introduces them & each pose is separate from each other w/o flow except for sun salutations. The ending meditation is as another said, has her speaking about what to visualize with the same no-nonsense voice.Billy's style -Unfortunately he only gets 10 min. His style was more traditional in that he had you do chair & then right after go into a standing fwd bend which I always do together even if the instructor does not as it just doesn't feel right unless you do. He does grunt or sighs a few times, but the same as anyone would when feeling & enjoying the energy more better in the body when you feel the stretch. In other words, he does have great body awareness & for me, I am more motivated by someone who is, rather then someone who sees yoga only for muscle building or burning calories. In the short 10 min, he does do a couple sun salutations (quicker, but good instruction then Patty), tree pose, a very modified dancer's pose to the point it's more a quadriceps stretch (but doesn't say it's modified), torso side stretch & not much else since it's only 10 min.I looked all over & the only clips I could find of Patty & Billy is on ""exercise. tv"" & in the store area.
