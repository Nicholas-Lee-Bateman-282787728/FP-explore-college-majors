1151537,A22TZUXUKA11SQ,B0015XWU9K,"K. Hinton ""avid reader""","[8, 8]","Army Wives is the story of a group of four soldiers' wives and one soldier's husband located at Fort Marshall in South Carolina. This series is based on the book of the same title by Tanya Biank,Army Wives: The Unwritten Code of Military Marriage.The series begins with Roxy, a smart-mouthed bartender who decides to marry private first class Trevor LeBlanc only a week after their courtship begins. Roxy has two kids by two different fathers and Trevor offers her stability, love, and a real family. She also knows nothing about the Army and is used to taking care of herself. Watching Roxy learn the trials and tribulations that come with being an army wife gives civilians who have no idea about it an insider's look. Then there are the more established wives like Claudia Joy Holden, whose husband is one of the highest ranking officers on post. He has also recently been overlooked for a position because one of the other wives called him a racist--something Claudia Joy won't take lying down. Also, there's Denise Sherwood, a sweet, kind woman whose teenage son often takes advantage of his mother's kind nature. Denise's husband is a major and he's overseas more than at home, but their marriage seems solid. And finally there's Pamela Moran, an ex-cop whose husband is in special ops. Pamela is heavily pregnant at the beginning of the series and we learn that it's because she's a surrogate who needs the money to get her family out of debt. The only army husband on the show, Roland Burton, is a psychiatrist specializing in post-traumatic stress. His wife is one of the highest ranking women on post. This ragtag bunch of ""army wives"" makes friends with one another despite their spouses' ranks, their own backgrounds, and their differences. They accept one another and the responsibility that comes with supporting the soldiers they're married to.When I first started watching this show, I'll admit it was because I think that most things on Lifetime are a train wreck and I wanted to see the carnage. But this show is surprisingly good for the network that gave us such hits asDeath of a Cheerleader (True Stories Collection TV Movie)andSex & The Single Mom. Army Wives is touching, dramatic, and entertaining. This is a story about real women, real marriages, and real lives that only happens to be airing on Lifetime. These characters go through everyday situations with the added pressure of having their actions put under the microscope because of their husband's or wife's profession. They have all the normal problems that regular marriages do: slow sex drives, thoughts of adultery, working outside the home, troubled children, they just have to do  it under more intense scrutiny. I urge everyone to give this series a chance rather than just shrugging it off because it's on Lifetime. I'm certainly glad that I did. Army Wives has the girl talk from a show like Sex and the City with the drama of a series like Law and Order and manages to blend the two into a fun, heartening series that anyone can enjoy.

I watched this because a very good high school friend of mine said it was great. I wasn't convinced by her review, however, because her husband was a career officer and she has a much more conservative political view than I, but she was absolutely correct. This is an example of TV at it's best! There is no attempt to politicize at all. What is there is superb writing, flawless directing, and great acting. In fact, you don't really realize how good the acting is until you see Jill Biden (later in the series) appear in a cameo and you get to compare her reading of lines with that of the regular ensemble. This is a very good 'slice of life' of soldiers and the military families and the problems that each faces. There is no attempt to sugar coat the story lines. If the Army would normally discharge a soldier, then that is what you see in this show. There are no miracle happy endings. A word of warning: you will likely find this show addicting to watch and will be very tempted to have your own personal Army Wives marathon. Through the six seasons, you get to watch children grow up, and are privy to very personal relationships with their ups and downs just as in real life. This show never lets up. The writing, directing, and acting never gets phoned in. You will be riveted to the TV screen for the 12-13 hours of each season. The title originally kept me from watching, but I'm so glad that I gave it a shot. It is without a doubt one of the best series ever on TV, and I can only say to you: Watch This Series!!
