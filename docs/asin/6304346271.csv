416155,A15W2D3WJW7NP7,6304346271,Pork Chop,"[0, 0]","Somebody to Love (1994) is a an movie that tells a lot about reality,touching on personal and business aspects of everyone`s life in the mega cities,never forgetting the primary goal of entertaining the movie paying public, withhumor, action, and a plot that captivates viewers.Often the charisma of the actors is paramount, and this is the case here, with HarveyKeitel playing Harry -  a seasoned veteran actor in the business, withall the implications it carries, such as prestige, work conditions, salary, frequencyof work, influence and respect seen from many sides.In this work, and script allowed  Keitel  to poke fun at himself, with paralells at his real liferole, encompassing moments where he sports a gorilla suit or jumps around in a cheeta underwear in frontof his girlfriend, etc.An equally strong and remarkable performance, is by Rosie Perez, playing  Mercedes  - a taxi dancer orescort or entertainer for guests  at a working class night club -  struggling toget ahead in her movie business career. Perez (as did Keitel) also pokes sarcastichumor at herseklf, with the ups and downs and struggles facing those wanting to participate and prosperin the movie industry.Next, there is a new face, (very reminiscent of Edward James Olmos),  Michael DeLorenzo, playing astruggling grave digger and laborerer, arrived from Mexico or South America, facing the sameusual downs of  anyone new to a city, such as solitude, dearth and modesty of financial and housing conditionsthe poverty of pay for the type of work donw, etc.He turns to an shady underground businessman,  played by  Anthony Quinn, making money from peep shoes andtitillation,  who recruits him to his organization as a money and narcotics carrier, and then hitman.The upshot, is a movie with a number of extreme aspects, from a sarcastic humor, to a sober realism,to violence, while maintaining a moving dynamism over 90 minutes, making it well worth watching.In short, Keitel again comes through in  a project that is professional and  artisticas is  the case with  many past  pictures.",3,"A movie that tells a lot about reality, entertaining",1327622400,"01 27, 2012",2012,2062,"['Somebody', 'Love', '1994', 'movie', 'lot', 'reality', 'touching', 'personal', 'business', 'aspects', 'everyone', 's', 'life', 'mega', 'cities', 'never', 'forgetting', 'primary', 'goal', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'paying', 'public', 'withhumor', 'action', 'plot', 'charisma', 'actors', 'paramount', 'case', 'here', 'HarveyKeitel', 'playing', 'Harry', 'seasoned', 'veteran', 'actor', 'business', 'implications', 'such', 'prestige', 'work', 'conditions', 'salary', 'frequencyof', 'work', 'influence', 'respect', 'seen', 'many', 'sides.In', 'work', 'script', 'allowed', 'Keitel', 'poke', 'fun', 'paralells', 'real', 'liferole', 'encompassing', 'moments', 'where', 'sports', 'gorilla', 'suit', 'jumps', 'cheeta', 'underwear', 'frontof', 'girlfriend', 'etc.An', 'equally', 'strong', 'remarkable', 'performance', 'Rosie', 'Perez', 'playing', 'Mercedes', 'taxi', 'dancer', 'orescort', 'entertainer', 'guests', 'working', 'class', 'night', 'club', 'struggling', 'toget', 'ahead', 'movie', 'business', 'career', 'Perez', 'did', 'Keitel', 'also', 'sarcastichumor', 'herseklf', 'ups', 'downs', 'struggles', 'facing', 'wanting', 'participate', 'prosperin', 'movie', 'industry.Next', 'new', 'face', 'very', 'reminiscent', 'Edward', 'James', 'Olmos', 'Michael', 'DeLorenzo', 'playing', 'astruggling', 'grave', 'digger', 'laborerer', 'arrived', 'Mexico', 'South', 'America', 'facing', 'sameusual', 'downs', 'anyone', 'new', 'city', 'such', 'solitude', 'dearth', 'modesty', 'financial', 'housing', 'conditionsthe', 'poverty', 'pay', 'type', 'work', 'donw', 'etc.He', 'turns', 'shady', 'underground', 'businessman', 'played', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'making', 'money', 'peep', 'shoes', 'andtitillation', 'who', 'organization', 'money', 'narcotics', 'carrier', 'then', 'hitman.The', 'upshot', 'movie', 'number', 'extreme', 'aspects', 'sarcastic', 'humor', 'sober', 'realism', 'violence', 'maintaining', 'moving', 'dynamism', '90', 'minutes', 'making', 'well', 'watching.In', 'short', 'Keitel', 'again', 'project', 'professional', 'artisticas', 'case', 'many', 'past', 'pictures']",Somebody to Love VHS

416158,A1JEFESGLIS076,6304346271,rsoonsa,"[1, 1]","Rosie Perez is the lead in this very engaging affair, cast as Mercedes, a young woman from Brooklyn who has resolved to become a film actress although not favoured by her circumstances, living in East Los Angeles and struggling with a series of fruitless auditions for any sort of part at all.  Mercedes has hooked up with a married and washed-up actor, Harry Harrelson (Harvey Keitel), who at one time had performed in a television Western series during the 1970s, and seldom since, accepting him as her lover, in part from loneliness, and as well from a hope that film parts will be coming her way because of his ""contacts"", but these latter are of small consequence as Harry is simply self-delusional in his attempts at recovering what he perceives as past cinematic renown.  In order to adequately support herself financially, Mercedes toils as a taxi dancer in a downtown Los Angeles Skid Row dance hall/bar while she continues carrying on her efforts to succeed at the motion picture business, and it is while there at the dance palace that a young immigrant from Mexico, Ernesto (Michael DeLorenzo), falls in love with her and the largest portion of the narrative depicts his efforts to please the object of his affections, even if they may mean losing her altogether.  This essentially tradition rooted melodrama is given only a moderate budget, despite the presence of a goodly number of well-known players, including Steve Buscemi, Anthony Quinn, and Stanley Tucci, and was kept in the can for about a year before its rather desultory distribution and leaden marketing efforts on its behalf, more's the pity as its solid production characteristics are firmly complemented by Alexandre Rockwell's admirably controlled direction, a consistent virtue of his work, and on display in this film from its very opening scene, frames that form a montage behind the credits, featuring Perez at Skid Row's Fifth and Main Streets.  Rockwell has often demonstrated that he operates very closely indeed with his cast, and this holds true in this instance as he allows his actors to create their roles while any ad libbing is neatened nicely via the editing process, resulting in an artistic success for the director, despite negative comments from some mainstream evaluators.  The film's scoring is aesthetically spot on with a good deal of it contributed by Tito Larriva, who also plays as band boss for the taxi dancers.  Acting honours here must go to the ever vital Perez, although nary a sub-par performance is turned in.  A fair test for any film's quality is given when a viewer will watch it twice within a brief period.  Sitting through this undervalued work will be considered a keen pleasure for many.",5,Top-Flight Direction Results In A Highly Enjoyable Film.,1203552000,"02 21, 2008",2008,2708,"['Rosie', 'Perez', 'lead', 'very', 'engaging', 'affair', 'cast', 'Mercedes', 'young', 'woman', 'Brooklyn', 'who', 'resolved', 'become', 'film', 'actress', 'not', 'favoured', 'circumstances', 'living', 'East', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'struggling', 'series', 'fruitless', 'auditions', 'sort', 'part', 'Mercedes', 'hooked', 'up', 'married', 'washed-up', 'actor', 'Harry', 'Harrelson', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'who', 'one', 'time', 'had', 'performed', 'television', 'Western', 'series', '1970s', 'seldom', 'accepting', 'lover', 'part', 'loneliness', 'as', 'well', 'hope', 'film', 'parts', 'will', 'be', 'coming', 'way', 'contacts', 'latter', 'are', 'small', 'consequence', 'Harry', 'simply', 'self-delusional', 'attempts', 'recovering', 'what', 'past', 'cinematic', 'renown', 'order', 'adequately', 'support', 'financially', 'Mercedes', 'taxi', 'dancer', 'downtown', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Skid', 'Row', 'dance', 'hall/bar', 'carrying', 'efforts', 'succeed', 'motion', 'picture', 'business', 'dance', 'palace', 'young', 'immigrant', 'Mexico', 'Ernesto', 'Michael', 'DeLorenzo', 'love', 'largest', 'portion', 'narrative', 'efforts', 'please', 'object', 'affections', 'even', 'may', 'mean', 'losing', 'altogether', 'essentially', 'tradition', 'rooted', 'melodrama', 'given', 'only', 'moderate', 'budget', 'presence', 'goodly', 'number', 'well-known', 'players', 'including', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'was', 'kept', 'can', 'year', 'rather', 'desultory', 'distribution', 'leaden', 'marketing', 'efforts', 'behalf', 'more', 'pity', 'solid', 'production', 'characteristics', 'are', 'firmly', 'complemented', 'Alexandre', 'Rockwell', 'admirably', 'controlled', 'direction', 'consistent', 'virtue', 'work', 'display', 'film', 'very', 'opening', 'scene', 'form', 'montage', 'credits', 'featuring', 'Perez', 'Skid', 'Row', 'Fifth', 'Main', 'Streets', 'Rockwell', 'often', 'demonstrated', 'very', 'closely', 'indeed', 'cast', 'true', 'instance', 'actors', 'create', 'roles', 'ad', 'libbing', 'neatened', 'nicely', 'editing', 'process', 'resulting', 'artistic', 'success', 'director', 'negative', 'comments', 'mainstream', 'evaluators', 'film', 'scoring', 'aesthetically', 'spot', 'good', 'deal', 'contributed', 'Tito', 'Larriva', 'who', 'also', 'band', 'boss', 'taxi', 'dancers', 'Acting', 'honours', 'here', 'must', 'go', 'ever', 'vital', 'Perez', 'nary', 'sub-par', 'performance', 'turned', 'fair', 'test', 'film', 'quality', 'given', 'when', 'viewer', 'will', 'watch', 'twice', 'brief', 'period', 'Sitting', 'undervalued', 'work', 'will', 'be', 'considered', 'keen', 'pleasure', 'many']",Somebody to Love VHS
