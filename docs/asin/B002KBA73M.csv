1274192,A3W4N04XZXPHVQ,B002KBA73M,Anne E,"[4, 4]","I bought this DVD after completing Lindsay's Postnatal Bootcamp 1 & 2. Those workouts helped me reach my pre-pregnancy weight, and the Shed 5 Fast helped to tone me up! Without this combination, I don't think I would've reached my exercise goals. I was able to not only drop the weight, get below my pre-pregnancy weight, and tone up; but I am wearing clothes from years ago that I thought I'd never fit into again! I feel great mentally & physically.To see results from this video, you must complete all 6 weeks. There are two workouts that you do for 3 weeks each. I did them on M/W/F and on Tue/Thurs I either did cardio workouts from Bootcamp or went for a run. If you dedicate yourself to these 6 weeks, you'll definitely see results! The workouts are challenging, but not impossible. It's great to have different levels to follow so that you can push yourself as time goes on. I loved that there are a variety of exercises incorporated in each workout. The 3/3 interval method is a great way to burn fat quickly!",5,Intense workout!,1270080000,"04 1, 2010",2010,1018,"['bought', 'DVD', 'completing', 'Lindsay', 'Postnatal', 'Bootcamp', '1', '2', 'workouts', 'helped', 'reach', 'pre-pregnancy', 'weight', 'Shed', '5', 'Fast', 'helped', 'tone', 'up', 'combination', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', ""'ve"", 'reached', 'exercise', 'goals', 'was', 'able', 'not', 'only', 'drop', 'weight', 'get', 'pre-pregnancy', 'weight', 'tone', 'up', 'am', 'wearing', 'clothes', 'years', 'thought', ""'d"", 'never', 'fit', 'again', 'feel', 'great', 'mentally', 'physically.To', 'see', 'results', 'video', 'must', 'complete', '6', 'weeks', 'are', 'two', 'workouts', 'do', '3', 'weeks', 'did', 'M/W/F', 'Tue/Thurs', 'either', 'did', 'cardio', 'workouts', 'Bootcamp', 'went', 'run', 'dedicate', '6', 'weeks', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'see', 'results', 'workouts', 'are', 'challenging', 'not', 'impossible', 'great', 'have', 'different', 'levels', 'follow', 'so', 'can', 'push', 'time', 'loved', 'are', 'variety', 'exercises', 'incorporated', 'workout', '3/3', 'interval', 'method', 'great', 'way', 'burn', 'fat', 'quickly']",N/A

I don't do it by itself because I find it too slow-paced and my heart-rate doesn't really get up there.  The second one, I don't like at all - the pace is just much too slow for me.  I strongly prefer Lindsay's Boot Camp 2.  Nonetheless, I do the first workout (with 30-Day-Shred) once a week, just to mix things up on easy days.",3,too slow paced for me,1288483200,"10 31, 2010",2010,420,"['DVD', 'two', 'workouts', 'first', 'one', 'do', 'warm', 'up', 'J.', 'Michael', '30-Day-Shred', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'find', 'too', 'slow-paced', 'heart-rate', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'up', 'there', 'second', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'pace', 'just', 'much', 'too', 'slow', 'strongly', 'prefer', 'Lindsay', 'Boot', 'Camp', '2', 'Nonetheless', 'do', 'first', 'workout', '30-Day-Shred', 'once', 'week', 'just', 'mix', 'things', 'up', 'easy', 'days']",N/A

I like that it is efficient and intense. (If I'm going to exercise, I'd better work up a good sweat!)

She has personally helped me (via email and phone) get into the best shape of my life after having three kids. This video is hard core (make sure you use appropriate weights to give you a good burn) and definitely a great workout! I love having several DVD's now to choose from for my workouts. It's great to have more variety. I haven't been disappointed with anything she has come out with.
