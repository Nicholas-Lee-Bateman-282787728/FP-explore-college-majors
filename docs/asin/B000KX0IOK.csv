1036490,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000KX0IOK,,"[3, 3]","****1/2Daniel Dunn is a young man suffering from a severe case of cognitive dissonance.  By day, he works as an inner city school teacher and basketball coach, doing his part to help his students break the cycle of poverty and make something of themselves.  By night, he's a crack cocaine addict, scouring the bars and back alleys of the neighborhood in search of his next ""fix.""  Somehow, Dunn is able to keep his deep dark secret hidden from the people at the school, until one night, after a game, he is found by one of his players completely strung out in a stall in the girls' locker room.  Drey, an inquisitive but level-headed youngster with problems of her own at home, doesn't turn him into the authorities, but rather strikes up a relationship of sorts with this man she admires, a relationship that might possibly hold the key to Dunn's eventual salvation.In his best role - and performance - since ""The Believer"" in 2001, Ryan Gosling proves yet again why he is one of the truly outstanding actors of his generation.  He hits not a single false note, playing a man completely beaten down by a demon he has no idea how to combat (he has apparently gone the detox, recovery-group route before but with no success).  Gosling's Oscar-nominated work here is mesmerizing and heartbreaking, as his character goes about leading this strange double existence, turning Dunn into a complex individual who is part Mr. Peepers, part tragic hero.  The screenplay by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck follows no set pattern or formula, moving fluidly and seemingly at random as it charts the very strange course Dunn`s life is taking.  The script carefully avoids having Dunn articulate too clearly his inner thoughts and feelings, leaving his actions and expressions to convey more than his words.  This not only provides Gosling with an opportunity to more thoroughly plumb the depths of his character but it makes the character himself more ambiguous and intriguing and thus much harder to read.Gosling is matched by young Shareeka Epps, who proves herself a screen natural in her acting debut as Drey, a girl made wise beyond her years by the circumstances of an absent father, an overworked mother and an older brother serving time in prison.  Despite all that, she is somehow still able to see the good in people, and it is that quality that allows her, tentatively at first, then with a bit more confidence, to lend a helping hand to her teacher.  Anthony Mackie is also first-rate as a neighborhood drug-dealer whom Dunn, with crushing irony, fears will be a harmful influence on Drey.Despite endless opportunities for feel-good moralizing and holier-than-thou speechifying, the film neither judge its characters nor preaches to its audience.  The movie is all about observing behavior and relating a compelling story, then leaving it up to the viewer to figure out how he feels about it all.  This is particularly evident in the closing scene of the film, which refuses to tie up all the loose ribbons into a nice, fancy bow, perfectly aware that life is simply too messy and inconclusive for pat endings.As director, Fleck uses a subtle handheld camera to bring a naturalistic feel to the film, but its movement is steady enough not to call undue attention to itself.  It's true that one does begin to wonder just when Dunn is able to complete all the mundane tasks that go along with teaching - the lesson planning, the grading of papers, the attendance at boring faculty meetings - when he is spending most of his evenings in search of the ultimate high, but we'll have to chalk that up to suspension of disbelief and move on from there.Beautifully acted and exquisitely directed, ""Half Nelson"" is easily one of the best films of 2006.",4,great Gosling performance,1179014400,"05 13, 2007",2007,3736,"['****1/2Daniel', 'Dunn', 'young', 'man', 'suffering', 'severe', 'case', 'cognitive', 'dissonance', 'day', 'inner', 'city', 'school', 'teacher', 'basketball', 'coach', 'doing', 'part', 'help', 'students', 'break', 'cycle', 'poverty', 'make', 'something', 'night', 'crack', 'cocaine', 'addict', 'scouring', 'bars', 'back', 'alleys', 'neighborhood', 'search', 'next', 'fix', 'Somehow', 'Dunn', 'able', 'keep', 'deep', 'dark', 'secret', 'hidden', 'people', 'school', 'one', 'night', 'game', 'found', 'one', 'players', 'completely', 'strung', 'out', 'stall', 'girls', 'locker', 'room', 'Drey', 'inquisitive', 'level-headed', 'youngster', 'problems', 'own', 'home', ""n't"", 'turn', 'authorities', 'rather', 'up', 'relationship', 'sorts', 'man', 'relationship', 'might', 'possibly', 'hold', 'key', 'Dunn', 'eventual', 'salvation.In', 'best', 'role', 'performance', 'Believer', '2001', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'yet', 'again', 'why', 'one', 'truly', 'outstanding', 'actors', 'generation', 'not', 'single', 'false', 'note', 'playing', 'man', 'completely', 'beaten', 'down', 'demon', 'idea', 'how', 'combat', 'apparently', 'gone', 'detox', 'recovery-group', 'route', 'success', 'Gosling', 'Oscar-nominated', 'work', 'here', 'mesmerizing', 'heartbreaking', 'character', 'leading', 'strange', 'double', 'existence', 'turning', 'Dunn', 'complex', 'individual', 'who', 'part', 'Mr.', 'Peepers', 'part', 'tragic', 'hero', 'screenplay', 'Anna', 'Boden', 'Ryan', 'Fleck', 'set', 'pattern', 'formula', 'moving', 'fluidly', 'seemingly', 'random', 'very', 'strange', 'course', 'Dunn', 's', 'life', 'taking', 'script', 'carefully', 'having', 'Dunn', 'articulate', 'too', 'clearly', 'inner', 'thoughts', 'feelings', 'leaving', 'actions', 'expressions', 'convey', 'more', 'words', 'not', 'only', 'Gosling', 'opportunity', 'more', 'thoroughly', 'plumb', 'depths', 'character', 'character', 'more', 'ambiguous', 'intriguing', 'thus', 'much', 'harder', 'read.Gosling', 'matched', 'young', 'Shareeka', 'Epps', 'who', 'screen', 'natural', 'acting', 'debut', 'Drey', 'girl', 'made', 'wise', 'years', 'circumstances', 'absent', 'father', 'overworked', 'mother', 'older', 'brother', 'serving', 'time', 'prison', 'somehow', 'still', 'able', 'see', 'good', 'people', 'quality', 'tentatively', 'first', 'then', 'bit', 'more', 'confidence', 'lend', 'helping', 'hand', 'teacher', 'Anthony', 'Mackie', 'also', 'first-rate', 'neighborhood', 'drug-dealer', 'whom', 'Dunn', 'crushing', 'irony', 'fears', 'will', 'be', 'harmful', 'influence', 'Drey.Despite', 'endless', 'opportunities', 'feel-good', 'moralizing', 'holier-than-thou', 'speechifying', 'film', 'judge', 'characters', 'preaches', 'audience', 'movie', 'observing', 'behavior', 'relating', 'compelling', 'story', 'then', 'leaving', 'viewer', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'particularly', 'evident', 'closing', 'scene', 'film', 'tie', 'up', 'loose', 'ribbons', 'nice', 'fancy', 'bow', 'perfectly', 'aware', 'life', 'simply', 'too', 'messy', 'inconclusive', 'pat', 'endings.As', 'director', 'Fleck', 'subtle', 'handheld', 'camera', 'bring', 'naturalistic', 'feel', 'film', 'movement', 'steady', 'enough', 'not', 'call', 'undue', 'attention', 'true', 'one', 'begin', 'wonder', 'just', 'when', 'Dunn', 'able', 'complete', 'mundane', 'tasks', 'go', 'along', 'teaching', 'lesson', 'planning', 'grading', 'papers', 'attendance', 'boring', 'faculty', 'meetings', 'when', 'spending', 'most', 'evenings', 'search', 'ultimate', 'high', ""'ll"", 'have', 'chalk', 'up', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'move', 'there.Beautifully', 'acted', 'exquisitely', 'directed', 'Half', 'Nelson', 'easily', 'one', 'best', 'films', '2006']",N/A

He takes his junior high history class through an impromptu exercise in history.  There are some methods to his madness, but not all the synapses are firing.  Mainly his.  He's also the girls' basketball coach.  And it is after one of their many losses that he enters the abandoned girls' locker room and lights up crack cocaine in the bathroom stall.  One of the friendlier students, Drey (Shareeka Epps) catches him strung out on the floor.  To save face, he takes her home, for her honest earning mom can't shuttle her daughter around.  She's not a soccer mom like in the suburbs.  On the sidelines, Dan parties with acquainances, including Drey's brother (Anthony Mackie) who is a drug dealer.  Drey keeps all things under her hat, and both coach and pupil develop a chummy relationship while Dan tries futilely to keep it professional.  At school, Dan makes connections in history about opposites conflicting with one another as a key component of history.  In the movie we make connections with the full cycle of the drug market from dealer to consumer.  (Even though the focus is more of a tight-knit drama and an examination of the characters than the subject matter, unlike an expose' like 'Traffic'.)Gosling gives a worthy Oscar nominee performance showing the subtlety of drug addiction like few others.  Mostly, other movies present it as more dramatic and less pedestrian.  We see his life slowly unravel as he becomes irritible about every interruption in the everyday chain.  At one point he throws a ball at the referee who seemed to be asleep at the wheel.  It is to their credit that filmmakers Ryan Fleck and Anna Borden, et al, provide a movie where he slowly loses footing in most major foundations of his life.  Once he spirals, colleagues begin to see that his life is amiss, but faithful Drey keeps her concern to the end.  Shattering but subtle, 'Half Nelson' creeps up on the viewer as well as the protagonist with a sincere presentation.",4,Connections,1171411200,"02 14, 2007",2007,2021,"['Dan', 'Dunne', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', ""n't"", 'have', 'act', 'together', 'junior', 'high', 'history', 'class', 'impromptu', 'exercise', 'history', 'are', 'methods', 'madness', 'not', 'synapses', 'are', 'firing', 'Mainly', 'also', 'girls', 'basketball', 'coach', 'one', 'many', 'losses', 'abandoned', 'girls', 'locker', 'room', 'up', 'crack', 'cocaine', 'bathroom', 'stall', 'One', 'friendlier', 'students', 'Drey', 'Shareeka', 'Epps', 'strung', 'out', 'floor', 'save', 'face', 'home', 'honest', 'earning', 'mom', 'ca', ""n't"", 'shuttle', 'daughter', 'not', 'soccer', 'mom', 'suburbs', 'sidelines', 'Dan', 'parties', 'acquainances', 'including', 'Drey', 'brother', 'Anthony', 'Mackie', 'who', 'drug', 'dealer', 'Drey', 'things', 'hat', 'coach', 'pupil', 'develop', 'chummy', 'relationship', 'Dan', 'futilely', 'keep', 'professional', 'school', 'Dan', 'connections', 'history', 'opposites', 'conflicting', 'one', 'key', 'component', 'history', 'movie', 'make', 'connections', 'full', 'cycle', 'drug', 'market', 'dealer', 'consumer', 'Even', 'focus', 'more', 'tight-knit', 'drama', 'examination', 'characters', 'subject', 'matter', 'expose', ""'Traffic"", 'Gosling', 'worthy', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'performance', 'showing', 'subtlety', 'drug', 'addiction', 'few', 'others', 'Mostly', 'other', 'movies', 'present', 'more', 'dramatic', 'less', 'pedestrian', 'see', 'life', 'slowly', 'unravel', 'irritible', 'interruption', 'everyday', 'chain', 'one', 'point', 'ball', 'referee', 'who', 'seemed', 'be', 'asleep', 'wheel', 'credit', 'filmmakers', 'Ryan', 'Fleck', 'Anna', 'Borden', 'et', 'al', 'provide', 'movie', 'where', 'slowly', 'footing', 'most', 'major', 'foundations', 'life', 'colleagues', 'begin', 'see', 'life', 'amiss', 'faithful', 'Drey', 'concern', 'end', 'Shattering', 'subtle', ""'Half"", 'Nelson', 'creeps', 'viewer', 'as', 'well', 'protagonist', 'sincere', 'presentation']",N/A

I'm not going to say anything that will spoil the film for you in any way shape or form; I promise.Many a review will tell you one thing about the ending; it's ambiguous.  It leaves the audience at a bit of a cliffhanger, wondering just what is going to happen next.  A lot of people have a problem with this kind of an ending; in fact it may have been that very ending that squashed this films hopes of becoming a huge Oscar contender (because, honestly, this film is leagues better than any of the films that the Academy nominated).  Our society demands a happy ending.  We are so fed up with our own realities that we need to escape into the fabricated happy lives of the Hollywood fairytale where every bad decision leads to a resolve that fixes everything for everyone and makes you feel all warm and fuzzy and ready to face tomorrow.  The realist in you tells you that what you are watching is unrealistic but the optimist in you tells you that all you have to do is believe and then `kicking drugs' will really be that easy.Ha.Well, `Half Nelson' is not the movie for you if you want a film that will lie to you in the ways most Hollywood films will do.  But, if you want a realistic film that broaches a dark subject with some intelligence and compassion then this is the film for you.`Half Nelson' tells the story of Dan Dunne, a young and energetic teacher who has a knack for reaching his students with his unique teaching style.  He also has a really bad drug habit that he uses to cover over the repressed feelings of failure and disapproval he faces in his life.  Drey, one of his brightest students, is sweet by nature and sparks something close to curiosity in Dan.  Drugs are also a big part of her life, but in a different way.  Having seen her brother tossed in prison for dealing you'd think that drugs would be the furthest thing from Drey's mind, but living in a poor neighborhood with little opportunities leaves Drey with only one viable means for escape; drugs.  Both Drey and Dan share a common bond; they are both enslaved to the inevitable, but with each others help and understanding they can overcome it.I got you with that last part, huh?  The whole `overcome it' statement.  Yeah, I warned you; this is not that type of movie.  But, that does not mean that this is not an inspirational film.  No matter what the outcome for these characters, their relationship is really a saving grace.  The way in which the addict and the inevitable dealer is handled is so beautifully understanding and realistic.  These are not your carbon copy junkies and villains; they are real, living, breathing humans with issues that rival yours and mine.They are you.They are me.The acting, as many have already mentioned, is impeccable.  It's a shame that Shareeka Epps didn't get more attention for her devastatingly raw portrayal of Drey.  She walks toe to toe with Gosling (who managed a deserved Oscar nomination) and delivers a performance that is just as good as his.  If only she were a bigger name star (and older, for I'm sure the age thing came up), then she would have garnered an Oscar nomination for sure.  I'll admit this too; I was floored by Anthony Mackie.  I normally find this actor to be irritating, annoying and the worst part of a movie; but he was stunningly accurate here and exceptionally convincing.His best performance to date, by a country mile.From the intimate and realistic script to the intimate and realistic performances, `Half Nelson' is a true independent gem of a film; a movie that gets everything right and then some.  One of the best films of the decade and truly one I will remember forever; I recommend this with the highest of praises.",5,Complete in every way...,1245196800,"06 17, 2009",2009,3829,"['Ok', 'first', 'thing', ""'m"", 'going', 'do', 'address', 'ending', 'get', 'freaked', 'out', ""'m"", 'going', 'say', 'too', 'much', 'stop', 'worrying', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'say', 'anything', 'will', 'spoil', 'film', 'way', 'shape', 'form', 'promise.Many', 'review', 'will', 'tell', 'one', 'thing', 'ending', 'ambiguous', 'audience', 'bit', 'cliffhanger', 'wondering', 'just', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'lot', 'people', 'have', 'problem', 'kind', 'ending', 'fact', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'ending', 'squashed', 'films', 'hopes', 'becoming', 'huge', 'Oscar', 'contender', 'honestly', 'film', 'leagues', 'better', 'films', 'Academy', 'nominated', 'society', 'happy', 'ending', 'are', 'so', 'fed', 'up', 'own', 'realities', 'need', 'escape', 'fabricated', 'happy', 'lives', 'Hollywood', 'fairytale', 'where', 'bad', 'decision', 'resolve', 'everything', 'everyone', 'feel', 'warm', 'fuzzy', 'ready', 'face', 'tomorrow', 'realist', 'tells', 'what', 'are', 'watching', 'unrealistic', 'optimist', 'tells', 'have', 'do', 'believe', 'then', 'kicking', 'drugs', 'will', 'really', 'be', 'easy.Ha.Well', 'Half', 'Nelson', 'not', 'movie', 'want', 'film', 'will', 'lie', 'ways', 'most', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'will', 'do', 'want', 'realistic', 'film', 'dark', 'subject', 'intelligence', 'compassion', 'then', 'film', 'you.', 'Half', 'Nelson', 'story', 'Dan', 'Dunne', 'young', 'energetic', 'teacher', 'who', 'knack', 'reaching', 'students', 'unique', 'teaching', 'style', 'also', 'really', 'bad', 'drug', 'habit', 'cover', 'repressed', 'feelings', 'failure', 'disapproval', 'life', 'Drey', 'one', 'brightest', 'students', 'sweet', 'nature', 'sparks', 'something', 'close', 'curiosity', 'Dan', 'Drugs', 'are', 'also', 'big', 'part', 'life', 'different', 'way', 'Having', 'seen', 'brother', 'tossed', 'prison', 'dealing', ""'d"", 'think', 'drugs', 'would', 'be', 'furthest', 'thing', 'Drey', 'mind', 'living', 'poor', 'neighborhood', 'little', 'opportunities', 'Drey', 'only', 'one', 'viable', 'escape', 'drugs', 'Drey', 'Dan', 'share', 'common', 'bond', 'are', 'enslaved', 'inevitable', 'others', 'help', 'understanding', 'can', 'overcome', 'it.I', 'got', 'last', 'part', 'huh', 'whole', 'overcome', 'statement', 'Yeah', 'warned', 'not', 'type', 'movie', 'not', 'mean', 'not', 'inspirational', 'film', 'matter', 'what', 'outcome', 'characters', 'relationship', 'really', 'saving', 'grace', 'way', 'addict', 'inevitable', 'dealer', 'handled', 'so', 'beautifully', 'understanding', 'realistic', 'are', 'not', 'carbon', 'copy', 'junkies', 'villains', 'are', 'real', 'living', 'breathing', 'humans', 'issues', 'rival', 'yours', 'mine.They', 'are', 'you.They', 'are', 'me.The', 'acting', 'many', 'have', 'already', 'mentioned', 'impeccable', 'shame', 'Shareeka', 'Epps', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'more', 'attention', 'devastatingly', 'raw', 'portrayal', 'Drey', 'walks', 'toe', 'toe', 'Gosling', 'who', 'managed', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'performance', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'only', 'were', 'bigger', 'name', 'star', 'older', ""'m"", 'sure', 'age', 'thing', 'came', 'up', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'garnered', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'sure', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'too', 'was', 'floored', 'Anthony', 'Mackie', 'normally', 'find', 'actor', 'be', 'irritating', 'annoying', 'worst', 'part', 'movie', 'was', 'stunningly', 'accurate', 'here', 'exceptionally', 'convincing.His', 'best', 'performance', 'date', 'country', 'intimate', 'realistic', 'script', 'intimate', 'realistic', 'performances', 'Half', 'Nelson', 'true', 'independent', 'gem', 'film', 'movie', 'everything', 'right', 'then', 'One', 'best', 'films', 'decade', 'truly', 'one', 'will', 'remember', 'forever', 'recommend', 'highest', 'praises']",N/A

1036494,ARA48345JZPZR,B000KX0IOK,Archmaker,"[3, 3]","Ryan Gosling was justly praised for his fine delineation of a dynamic and committed inner city school teacher whose private life is spinning out of control due to his losing struggle with cocaine and crack.  It is fine and subtle work and he conveys paragraphs of dialogue with a self-deprecating smile and hopeless exchange of looks with a caring and adoring student, beautifully played by Shareeka Epps, who has stumbled onto the facts of her inspiring teacher's contradictory sordid private life.The film generates the same frustrating emotions while waiting for Gosling's Dan to make one more stupid decision, one more self-destructive act, that anyone has felt if they've ever had to deal with someone with an addiction problem.  The film gets that right, without being pedantic or preachy.We don't get to the source of Dan's anger, despair, or whatever his demons may be, and that is just as well because it really doesn't matter.  What the film does illustrate is that addictive drugs can addict anyone, even smart and caring people, because they're addictive.  There doesn't have to be any other reason.We see an old girlfriend who has cleaned-up and is about to marry someone else, and we can but hope that Dan, despite his avowed rejection of rehab for himself, will eventually find his way back, and the movie ends with a hope, but not a declaration.  Fittingly.In general, I dislike a lot of hand-held camera work; but, I realize that a film like this wouldn't be made without some budget restrictions and it would require its use.  It does lend some intimacy, and besides, a film like this is all about the characters and acting, not where the camera is at any given moment.

(I know Gosling got an Oscar nomination out of it, but it was Shareeka Epps playing Drey who steals a lot of scenes.) The film was also unexpectedly funny, with any number of subtly wrought ironic turnarounds.But since I'm here to split hairs, here's a couple of cavils. Short of someone slipping Seconal into the school's water supply, the middle schoolers in Dan Dunne's class were unbelievably mellow. (I know, part of the motif of the film is how mature the students are compared to their teacher, but c'mon.) Further, after Dunne throws the basketball at a referee, he smokes crack in the bathroom. In fact, he would have had to smoke his crack elsewhere, as 99% of the schools in the country would have had him escorted from the building (and probably fired) for throwing the ball in the first place.

It has something fresh at its core and a stellar performance from lead actor Ryan Gosling (it earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor last year), but the story is so loose and vague (especially the ending) that it will drive many watchers to distraction.The freshness comes from the fact that this isn't a story about some great white hero coming to a downtrodden, black school in order to lift their educational spirits and thus their chances of breaking out of the drug ring mold so often affiliated with this genre (see THE PRINCIPAL or DANGEROUS MINDS as prime examples). This is the story of a teacher named Dan Dunne (Ryan Gosling) who's drug problems spill out of his personal life and into his professional one. This is noticed one day by one of his students named Drey (Shareeka Epps), a thirteen-year-old who's in Dan's history class and part of the school's girls basketball team, which he coaches.Dan's teaching-life begins to show cracks as he rambles off on inane topics during class and eventually, in a more physical manner, when his nose starts bleeding spontaneously.Drey has issues of her own, trying to deal with a brother who's in prison (for selling drugs), a mother who works so much that she's turned her daughter into a latchkey kid, and the advances of a local drug runner named Frank (Anthony Mackie, FREEDOMLAND), who wants to use Drey as one of his delivery folks. All of these things pull at Drey and we see her struggle to understand why the world around her is so terrible and how someone she's looked up to (her teacher) could be a part of it.Both Dan and Drey try to save each other in their own way, too. Drey by waiting for her teacher after school so that she can distract him from his self-destructive ways, and Dan by confronting Frank and asking him to leave Drey alone.Gosling's performance of a drug-addled and lost soul is spot-on. His win at the Independent Spirit Awards for Best Actor was well deserved, as was his Academy Award nomination. Young Shareeka Epps plays well beside the towering Gosling but wasn't quite up to his level.The big letdown, however, was the loose reins of the story as a whole. We never witness what happens to Gosling's character at the school after a substitute comes to replace him (we might assume that he went into a recovery program or was fired from his job or both, but we don't know; he may also have just quit in order to save his students from his destructive behavior but, again, we just don't know).The ending sequence is interesting if, again, a bit too vague. We're not privy to what becomes of Gosling and Epps' characters. They're left sitting on a sofa staring at the camera, making one believe that either things aren't going to change or that great changes await them.

Anthony Mackie also shone as family friend and self-appointed, dubious watchdog Frank.  However, the acting couldn't salvage a depressing, flat-action, preachy film whose characters were all either pitiable or odious.With very few exceptions (most notably Drey and her single mother), everyone was morally reprehensible, including minor and unexpected characters.  Dunnes' parents embrace their son during a rare visit home and profess admiration for his chosen vocation... until Dad makes offensive racial comments and inappropriate Ebonics jokes.  Frank's girlfriend shows potential as a possible female role model for Drey... until a flash of the camera in one scene reveals the two interacting while Drey weighs and packages drugs for Frank.  And wasn't Dunne himself bad enough as a negligent, America-hating, drug-using burnout?  Did we have to witness him try to force himself on his new girlfriend against her wishes as well?I could handle the realism of the life and characters depicted in Half-Nelson, and I didn't mind the film's slow pace or lack of a real plot line.  What I couldn't stomach was the movie's pretentiousness:  characters committed atrocious acts on a regular basis (using drugs on school property, teaching and driving students under the influence, sending kids to transact drug deals), yet kept their dignity by studying communist propaganda and speaking in Leftist platitudes against the man.  The classroom scenes featured hollow rhetoric about struggles and suppression, emphasizing all the historic events which cast white America in the worst light possible.  Token footage was given to an anti-WMD screed that was out of context, even given Dunne's carefully demonstrated political leanings.  His character was the prototypic far-Left hypocrite, thinking globally while abdicating responsibility locally.",2,"Great Acting, But It Didn't Matter",1174953600,"03 27, 2007",2007,2149,"['Ryan', 'Gosling', 'Daniel', 'Dunne', 'Shareeka', 'Epps', 'Drey', 'totally', 'convinced', 'gritty', 'honest', 'performances', 'bleakness', 'inner-city', 'surroundings', 'tenderness', 'difficult', 'teacher-student', 'relationship', 'further', 'complicated', 'latter', 'witnessing', 'former', 'drug', 'use', 'Anthony', 'Mackie', 'also', 'shone', 'family', 'friend', 'self-appointed', 'dubious', 'watchdog', 'Frank', 'However', 'acting', 'could', ""n't"", 'salvage', 'depressing', 'flat-action', 'preachy', 'film', 'characters', 'were', 'pitiable', 'odious.With', 'very', 'few', 'exceptions', 'most', 'notably', 'Drey', 'single', 'mother', 'everyone', 'was', 'morally', 'reprehensible', 'including', 'minor', 'unexpected', 'characters', 'Dunnes', 'parents', 'embrace', 'son', 'rare', 'visit', 'home', 'profess', 'admiration', 'chosen', 'vocation', 'Dad', 'offensive', 'racial', 'comments', 'inappropriate', 'Ebonics', 'jokes', 'Frank', 'girlfriend', 'potential', 'possible', 'female', 'role', 'model', 'Drey', 'flash', 'camera', 'one', 'scene', 'two', 'interacting', 'Drey', 'weighs', 'packages', 'drugs', 'Frank', 'was', ""n't"", 'Dunne', 'bad', 'enough', 'negligent', 'America-hating', 'drug-using', 'burnout', 'Did', 'have', 'witness', 'try', 'force', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'wishes', 'well', 'could', 'handle', 'realism', 'life', 'characters', 'depicted', 'Half-Nelson', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'film', 'slow', 'pace', 'lack', 'real', 'plot', 'line', 'What', 'could', ""n't"", 'stomach', 'was', 'movie', 'pretentiousness', 'characters', 'committed', 'atrocious', 'acts', 'regular', 'basis', 'using', 'drugs', 'school', 'property', 'teaching', 'driving', 'students', 'influence', 'sending', 'kids', 'transact', 'drug', 'deals', 'yet', 'kept', 'dignity', 'studying', 'communist', 'propaganda', 'speaking', 'Leftist', 'platitudes', 'man', 'classroom', 'scenes', 'featured', 'hollow', 'rhetoric', 'struggles', 'suppression', 'emphasizing', 'historic', 'events', 'cast', 'white', 'America', 'worst', 'light', 'possible', 'Token', 'footage', 'was', 'given', 'anti-WMD', 'screed', 'was', 'context', 'even', 'given', 'Dunne', 'carefully', 'demonstrated', 'political', 'leanings', 'character', 'was', 'prototypic', 'far-Left', 'hypocrite', 'thinking', 'globally', 'abdicating', 'responsibility', 'locally']",N/A

Though slow (as it should have been), it displayed the growing friendship between teacher and student, both in need of something beyond their normal lives.

While some might say the film lacks a plot or traditional climax, the scenes in the bathroom and in the hotel room provide the viewer with those very climactic scenes, with those moments that leave you feeling like something within the characters have changed. This ties in with the classroom discussion on change, on turning points, on opposing forces, on working within and against the machine.

1036501,A3J5UO5QMTFSWB,B000KX0IOK,"Connoisseur Rat ""armchair experientialist""","[0, 0]","Half Nelson begins with a whole lot of alarms going off.  It opens with an insistent clock radio, buzzing inside a sparely-furnished apartment.  The first internal shot of a Brooklyn school also features an alarm bell blaring in the background.  And our first glimpse of teacher Dan Dunne's disheveled appearance (both at home and at work) is in itself alarming.You might think these signals serve as some kind of warning for the events to follow.  And you would be right, to a point.  For while the cinematic ride that ensues is bound to set off all kinds of internal warnings in the viewer, as it edges quite close to crossing some very-uncomfortable lines, the movie itself is so good that it left me feeling wide awake and strangely refreshed - alarming though it may be.The film, whose title is (according to the filmmakers' commentary) a ""metaphor for being caught in an uncomfortable position and trying to get out of it,"" features two main characters who are thusly bound, both striving to - if not break free - at least achieve a more manageable level of comfort inside of their strangling situations.There's the aforementioned Dan Dunne (Ryan Gosling, in his second Oscar-worthy performance along with his role in ""The Believer""), the wry, self-defeated, likeable but oh-so-very-flawed teacher who wants to change the world while not being able to change himself.  And there's the shy but defiant, independent, fiercely-intelligent Drey (in a strikingly real performance by first-time actress Shareeka Epps, who deserved an Oscar Nomination far more than Little Miss Sunshine's Abigail Breslin ever did), attempting to negotiate her way through an obstacle-filled life maze of inner city circumstances (i.e. absentee father, mother never home, brother in prison, and drug dealers offering ways out).Though they're both loners at heart, they forge a bond from an unorthodox yet catalyzing moment, when Drey catches Dan doing drugs in the school bathroom.  In an extended, mostly dialog-free scene that lets the audience really soak in the discomfort of the moment, Drey begins to tend to Dan as he cannot tend to himself.  And when Dan finally feels well enough to ask his student, ""Can you help me up?"" this innocent-seeming request really sets the stage for the rest of the film, as we see whether their unusual alliance can indeed serve to help Dan up and out of his downward spiral.Besides the unparalleled acting, in my estimation this film rises above almost all other 2006 movie offerings for two reasons: the writing and the editing.  Or maybe in this case I should say the lack of writing.  Because this is one of those films where the acting is so good that there's no need for a lot of expositional dialog (which is my least favorite kind).  So the actors in this case say a lot more about their histories and relationships with their eyes, faces and postures than they ever could with their words.  I find this to be a rare state of affairs in movies (especially American film) these days and so it is to be treasured whenever I find it.And the editing is smart enough to follow suit and take its cues from the streamlined, non-verbal exposition.  Thus, this masterfully-edited film has many scenes which cut away sooner than a more conventional film would, trusting the audience to fill in the blanks themselves rather than spelling the situation out for them.  This really helps to keep a film without a lot of plotting from becoming too plodding.Half Nelson was one of my favorite movies of 2006, but the DVD is actually even better due to the insightful and engaging commentary provided by writer/director Ryan Fleck and writer/editor/producer Anna Boden.  That makes this DVD a definite must own, even if the other features are somewhat lacking (6 minutes of only mildly-amusing outtakes, 4 minutes of wisely-deleted scenes, and 4 extended scenes that can't be played all at once and have to be chosen individually.  Plus a music video which I found to be rather extraneous).Finally, a note of caution: if you rely on closed-captioning, the English subtitles are horrible.  Any time someone new speaks or something new is said, the previous sentence disappears from the screen, oftentimes in a split second.  So approach this one with caution if you're hard of hearing.  But that is my only word of warning for this otherwise outstanding film and DVD.",5,"""Can You Help Me Up?""",1174176000,"03 18, 2007",2007,4377,"['Half', 'Nelson', 'whole', 'lot', 'alarms', 'going', 'off', 'insistent', 'clock', 'radio', 'buzzing', 'sparely-furnished', 'apartment', 'first', 'internal', 'shot', 'Brooklyn', 'school', 'also', 'alarm', 'bell', 'blaring', 'background', 'first', 'glimpse', 'teacher', 'Dan', 'Dunne', 'disheveled', 'appearance', 'home', 'work', 'alarming.You', 'might', 'think', 'signals', 'serve', 'kind', 'warning', 'events', 'follow', 'would', 'be', 'right', 'point', 'cinematic', 'ride', 'bound', 'set', 'off', 'kinds', 'internal', 'warnings', 'viewer', 'quite', 'close', 'crossing', 'very-uncomfortable', 'lines', 'movie', 'so', 'good', 'left', 'feeling', 'wide', 'awake', 'strangely', 'refreshed', 'alarming', 'may', 'be.The', 'film', 'title', 'according', 'filmmakers', 'commentary', 'metaphor', 'being', 'caught', 'uncomfortable', 'position', 'trying', 'get', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'thusly', 'bound', 'striving', 'not', 'break', 'free', 'least', 'achieve', 'more', 'manageable', 'level', 'comfort', 'strangling', 'aforementioned', 'Dan', 'Dunne', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'second', 'Oscar-worthy', 'performance', 'role', 'Believer', 'wry', 'self-defeated', 'likeable', 'oh-so-very-flawed', 'teacher', 'who', 'change', 'world', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'change', 'shy', 'defiant', 'independent', 'fiercely-intelligent', 'Drey', 'strikingly', 'real', 'performance', 'first-time', 'actress', 'Shareeka', 'Epps', 'who', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'Nomination', 'far', 'more', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'ever', 'did', 'attempting', 'negotiate', 'way', 'obstacle-filled', 'life', 'maze', 'inner', 'city', 'circumstances', 'i.e', 'absentee', 'father', 'mother', 'never', 'home', 'brother', 'prison', 'drug', 'dealers', 'offering', 'ways', 'out', ""'re"", 'loners', 'heart', 'forge', 'bond', 'unorthodox', 'yet', 'catalyzing', 'moment', 'when', 'Drey', 'Dan', 'doing', 'drugs', 'school', 'bathroom', 'extended', 'mostly', 'dialog-free', 'scene', 'audience', 'really', 'discomfort', 'moment', 'Drey', 'tend', 'Dan', 'can', 'not', 'tend', 'when', 'Dan', 'finally', 'well', 'enough', 'ask', 'student', 'Can', 'help', 'up', 'innocent-seeming', 'request', 'really', 'stage', 'rest', 'film', 'see', 'unusual', 'alliance', 'can', 'indeed', 'serve', 'help', 'Dan', 'up', 'downward', 'unparalleled', 'acting', 'estimation', 'film', 'almost', 'other', '2006', 'movie', 'offerings', 'two', 'reasons', 'writing', 'editing', 'maybe', 'case', 'should', 'say', 'lack', 'writing', 'one', 'films', 'where', 'acting', 'so', 'good', 'need', 'lot', 'expositional', 'dialog', 'least', 'favorite', 'kind', 'actors', 'case', 'say', 'lot', 'more', 'histories', 'relationships', 'eyes', 'postures', 'ever', 'could', 'words', 'find', 'be', 'rare', 'state', 'affairs', 'movies', 'especially', 'American', 'film', 'days', 'be', 'treasured', 'whenever', 'find', 'it.And', 'editing', 'smart', 'enough', 'follow', 'suit', 'take', 'cues', 'streamlined', 'non-verbal', 'exposition', 'Thus', 'masterfully-edited', 'film', 'many', 'scenes', 'cut', 'away', 'sooner', 'more', 'conventional', 'film', 'would', 'trusting', 'audience', 'fill', 'blanks', 'rather', 'spelling', 'situation', 'out', 'really', 'keep', 'film', 'lot', 'plotting', 'becoming', 'too', 'plodding.Half', 'Nelson', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', '2006', 'DVD', 'actually', 'even', 'better', 'due', 'insightful', 'engaging', 'commentary', 'provided', 'writer/director', 'Ryan', 'Fleck', 'writer/editor/producer', 'Anna', 'Boden', 'DVD', 'definite', 'must', 'own', 'even', 'other', 'features', 'are', 'somewhat', 'lacking', '6', 'minutes', 'only', 'mildly-amusing', 'outtakes', '4', 'minutes', 'wisely-deleted', 'scenes', '4', 'extended', 'scenes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'played', 'once', 'have', 'be', 'chosen', 'individually', 'music', 'video', 'found', 'be', 'rather', 'extraneous', '.Finally', 'note', 'caution', 'rely', 'closed-captioning', 'English', 'subtitles', 'are', 'horrible', 'time', 'someone', 'new', 'speaks', 'something', 'new', 'said', 'previous', 'sentence', 'disappears', 'screen', 'oftentimes', 'split', 'second', 'So', 'one', 'caution', ""'re"", 'hard', 'hearing', 'only', 'word', 'warning', 'otherwise', 'outstanding', 'film', 'DVD']",N/A

At one point, during a heated conversation, Gosling's character  exclaims ""I don't know, I don't know,"" and it's pretty much a metaphor for the performance.  This is a lost man, anchored to nothing, desperately in need of a reason to live, let alone get up in the morning.  He's utterly ordinary, which makes his drug addiction that much more disturbing and sad; this could be your brother or best friend.  In supporting roles, Shareeka Epps and Anthony Mackie give superb, if less nuanced, performances.  It's all very real, down to the women cast as Gosling's love interests; not one is particularly attractive, as might be the case if this were a studio film.  But then if it were, the filmmakers would have been forced to wrap up this ambiguous tale in a feel-good, trumped up, utterly false coda.  Instead, we're left with unanswered questions and no clear idea what the future holds.  And that's Life.

1036510,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000KX0IOK,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 2]","Two knockout performances dominate this uncompromising and emotionally visceral indie. Directed and co-written by first-time feature director Ryan Fleck, this 2006 drama pulls no punches and offers no cheap sentiment in the story of two people intractably bonded by their mutually desultory existences - Dan Dunne, a crack-addicted Brooklyn middle school history teacher, and Drey, a 13-year old student in his class burdened by an overworked mother, a brother in prison, and an insinuating drug dealer named Frank. Fleck and co-writer Anna Boden establish Dan's gifts as a teacher almost immediately as the character engages his class with natural ease. It becomes clear that this is not going to be a fish-out-of-water story but a more complex study of a man caught between his passion for teaching and his hopeless need for the next fix.Dan's self-defeating effort to separate the duality in his life is what provides the impetus of the plot, as there are no simple explanations offered for his drug-addled life until we catch a glimpse of his emotionally disconnected family later on. Much like what Vera Farmiga achieved inDown to the Bone, Ryan Gosling dissects his character with textured precision and conviction. He honestly earns our attention and even our compassion despite the selfishness Dan displays at times. Matching Gosling all the way is novice Shareeka Epps, who plays Drey with almost unnerving steadiness. She affectingly conveys the self-protective insulation her character has against a world too ready to use her.Together Gosling and Epps remarkably achieve an unexpected symbiosis that makes Dan's and Drey's ongoing struggles palpable. The supporting cast is uniformly strong with effective turns by Anthony Mackie, who shows surprising depth in what could have been a stock villain role as Frank, and by Karen Chilton etching the regret and exhaustion in Drey's mother in just a few brief scenes. Even though the film was done on a miniscule budget, it doesn't feel cheap with particularly strong work found in Andrij Parekh's intentionally bleached-out cinematography. The 2007 DVD offers a nice, unassuming commentary track by Fleck and Boden, but the rest of the extras are not very interesting - a gag reel, three understandably deleted scenes and four extended scenes that really don't add much more insight.

Complex and moving, it challenges the viewer to confront easy stereotypes. Ryan Gosling gives an amazing performance as Dan, a crack-addicted teacher in an inner city school in NYC. He states the kids keep him grounded, and I believe him. One of his students is Drey, played with heartbreaking somberness by Shareeka Epps. They start an uneasy friendship after she catches the teacher high one night at school. The relationship is one of opposing forces, as Dan lectures one day in his class: black and white, teacher and student, adult and child. But there is far more ambiguity explored here, which I love to see in films. It's not the traditional white teacher saves the poor minority students tale we've seen before.There are so many scenes that the movie gets just right. When Drey finds her teacher high the first time, it's almost painful to see Gosling's reaction. And when Dan goes home for a family dinner, you can see exactly where the addiction was fostered.

He has to deal with all those romanticizing sentimentalities and platitudes that have been codified over the past couple of decades, the 'plight of the black' that gives liberals lumps in their throats and on which patronizers like a Baratunde Thurston so seriously, gravely lecture us, while posing as 'comedy', let alone 'Oprah' and the point where even the mere pretense of sham intrigue is cast into the fire and the beast raises its head.'Half Nelson' from 2006 is actually a relic, I think. Publishing black feel-good movies with a white JUDAS-GOAT has been a liberal war tactic for some time now. With the numerical, and thus political demographic dispossession of whites, old tactics used to attack the enemy become irrelevant and need to be revised. Thus, we have 'Precious', '12 years a slave', and similar racial heroism and revenge fantasies that have all black casts or the dynamics of which are no longer primarily for the sake of conversion but rather triumphalism; Precious is about the crack plague blacks suffered in the 1980's, TWELVE YEARS essentially about THE WHITE MAN, both of which re-appropriate the context for accusation: we have our two minutes hate.

They're very powerful now but there is still a sizeable amount of barely non-reconstructed little white females that need only a push to tip over into oblivion. HN is that push. Cast a popular white guy in the 'plight of the black' and suddenly we get a bunch of white females caring about 'the plight of the black' and anything that may serve as a proxy for THE PLIGHT. It'll work just like Oprah, that demi-god.This is what we have now, endless self-marketing. You would like to think that its you doing the marketing, but you're not.

1036513,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000KX0IOK,Grady Harp,"[3, 4]","HALF NELSON is one of those rare breed of films that takes a unique idea, wraps it in an intelligent script, finds the perfect actors to bring the story to life, and does it all on a minimal budget that goes for the jugular rather than the glitz of promotion.  It is a little miracle of a movie.Dan Dunne (Ryan Gosling in a breakout performance) is an idealistic, fervent teacher recently graduated from college with a profound desire to make things different - in education and in the world.  He is assigned to a junior high school in the ghetto where he is one of the rare white teachers for a black and Hispanic population: the principal is a hardnosed black lady who has rigid rules about curriculum and tutorial techniques.  Dunne teaches his own way, involving his students in understanding rather than memorizing history.  He is committed to his ideals but his technique is very student friendly and his class respects his demeanor.  Very subtly he draws out the significance of important historical events, allowing the students to embrace the essence of civil rights rather than the rhetoric of the usual classroom approach.Dunne has a problem: he has learned to temper his frustrations and ambitions by escaping into drugs and he uses cocaine to soften his world. The 'crisis' of the story is the juncture when his brightest student Drey (Shareeka Epps in a stunning performance) discovers Dunne's secret when she catches him smoking crack in the very gym where Dunne is coaching an all-girl basketball team.  With minimal words and maximal eye contact and tacit understanding Dunne and Drey bond.  Drey is lonely: her brother is in prison for dealing drugs, her mother is works double time as a security officer to support them, and her brother's friend Frank (Anthony Mackie) coerces Drey into delivering drugs to his clients.  How the bond between Dunne and Drey plays is the message of the film.  This is not a physical love relationship but a sensitive fulfillment of needs between two bright people on the cusp of society's flaws.Ryan Fleck directs this film with the most subtle and sensitive technique, allowing us to view the flaws as well as the virtues of his characters. The script written by both Fleck and Anna Boden is creative in the classroom communication and minimal in the interplay outside the classroom, allowing the words to be superceded by eye messages and silence that is deafening.  Gosling and Epps are brilliant in their ability to keep their characters credible, never opting for histrionics, always choosing to underplay potentially volatile scenes.

This allows the Actors and Writers more artistic freedom. Reminiscent of 2000's excellent ""Requiem for a Dream,"" ""Half Nelson"" shows the ravages of drug addiction on a seemingly normal person. At the beginning of the film, Ryan Gosling's Dan Dunne seems merely an offbeat, creative inner-city Teacher, but the depth of his crack addition soon begins to show. Mr. Gosling bravely tackles this role with grace and a strange dignity - halfway into the film he wears a goofy bandage on his lip after a girlfriend pops him during a crack-fueled seduction. His Oscar nomination is well-deserved: he never takes this role ""over the top"" and manages to be sympathetic and tragic all at once.

The spate of inspirational teacher films is many; one where a teacher is flawed and struggling are hard to come by, and this is one of those that hits this theme right out of the ballpark.Dan Dunne, junior high school teacher, teaches inspriationally, realistically, with realistic, bright kids. The feel of his classroom, one of discourse and lecture, is one that is supprtive, relavent and positive. Which makes it all the more heartbreaking that Dunne is a junkie, dealing with the reality of his substance abuse problem, and how it immediately impacts his role when one of his students finds him using.This film is real, manging to avoid the cliched stereotypes of education films, and dares to present Dunne as real. Ryan Gosliing nails Dunne immediately. His deft, sad performance is definitely Oscar worthy, and made even better by Shareeka Epps' performance as Drey. Together they make a complex pair, teacher and student, humans trying to relate to each other and the awkward circumstances in their lives. Their relationship provides some uneasy moments, ones where you might think the film is crossing a line.Half Nelson is NOT for people wanting an uplifting story, or a feel-good education movie (there are plenty of them out there, may I suggest Akeelah and the Bee?), but if you like a great script, human characters and the dynamic complexities of life, Half Nelson would be for you.",5,A teacher as his human-est,1172361600,"02 25, 2007",2007,1499,"['Teachers', 'are', 'long', 'held', 'up', 'beacons', 'hope', 'inspirational', 'figures', 'effect', 'shape', 'lives', 'spate', 'inspirational', 'teacher', 'films', 'many', 'one', 'where', 'teacher', 'flawed', 'struggling', 'are', 'hard', 'come', 'one', 'theme', 'right', 'ballpark.Dan', 'Dunne', 'junior', 'high', 'school', 'teacher', 'teaches', 'inspriationally', 'realistically', 'realistic', 'bright', 'kids', 'feel', 'classroom', 'one', 'discourse', 'lecture', 'one', 'supprtive', 'relavent', 'positive', 'more', 'heartbreaking', 'Dunne', 'junkie', 'dealing', 'reality', 'substance', 'abuse', 'problem', 'how', 'immediately', 'role', 'when', 'one', 'students', 'using.This', 'film', 'real', 'manging', 'avoid', 'cliched', 'stereotypes', 'education', 'films', 'present', 'Dunne', 'real', 'Ryan', 'Gosliing', 'nails', 'Dunne', 'immediately', 'deft', 'sad', 'performance', 'definitely', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'made', 'even', 'better', 'Shareeka', 'Epps', 'performance', 'Drey', 'Together', 'make', 'complex', 'pair', 'teacher', 'student', 'humans', 'trying', 'relate', 'other', 'awkward', 'circumstances', 'lives', 'relationship', 'uneasy', 'moments', 'ones', 'where', 'might', 'think', 'film', 'crossing', 'line.Half', 'Nelson', 'NOT', 'people', 'wanting', 'uplifting', 'story', 'feel-good', 'education', 'movie', 'are', 'plenty', 'there', 'may', 'suggest', 'Akeelah', 'Bee', 'like', 'great', 'script', 'human', 'characters', 'dynamic', 'complexities', 'life', 'Half', 'Nelson', 'would', 'be']",N/A

It has some good parts, but too many flaws to be really satisfying.The plot is very basic. It's about an inner-city school history teacher and basketball coach, Dan Dunne, who's struggling with a drug addiction. While struggling with various personal relationships, Dunne tries to stear one of his best pupils, Dre, away from Frank, a small-time drug dealer. Dre lives in a single-parent household, and her mother is away most of the time. Since her father never visits her, the only strong male presence in her life, other than Dunne, is Frank the drug dealer. More character-driven than plot-driven, the movie starts out good but then just wanders. To elaborate, I thought that the first 45 minutes were very well-done; it showed how Dunne is a natural leader in the classroom, even though the principal is none too happy with his lack of sticking to the assigned curriculum. In addition, I thought that it was going to be a documentary-style drama, in the vein ofBloody SundayorUnited 93 (Widescreen Edition). I felt like I was a fly on the wall, observing the lives of Dan and Dre. Unfortunately, the movie loses focus in the second half. I kept expecting some kind of development to happen, but it never did. Is it going to be a movie about how Dunne overcomes his personal demons? There's some hint of that, but it wasn't explored enough to be convincing. Or is Half Nelson supposed to be about how he learns to bond with the students? That angle wasn't even explored, except for his relationship with Dre. As for Dre, is the movie about her move away from Frank? This is explored, but the resolution of the issue was not convincing. Finally, I wasn't looking for a ""happy ending"" at the end, but I was looking for some kind of closure. In other words, the movie doesn't end so much as it stops. Frankly, the only thing that kept the movie from unraveling was Gosling's performance. Shareeka Epps, who plays Dre, is definitely promising, but not in Gosling's league.Overall, I would say ""Half Nelson"" is worth watching, particularly if you enjoy dramas about inner city schools or drug addiction. Plus, viewers of the left-wing persuasion will likely be pleased with Dunne's teaching the students the dialectical method of history. I was just too disappointed with the 2nd half of the movie to give this a strong recommendation.",3,Worth Watching,1176336000,"04 12, 2007",2007,2497,"['had', 'heard', 'good', 'things', 'Half', 'Nelson', 'when', 'saw', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'was', 'nominated', 'best', 'actor', 'performance', 'movie', 'decided', 'rent', 'good', 'parts', 'too', 'many', 'flaws', 'be', 'really', 'satisfying.The', 'plot', 'very', 'basic', 'inner-city', 'school', 'history', 'teacher', 'basketball', 'coach', 'Dan', 'Dunne', 'who', 'struggling', 'drug', 'addiction', 'struggling', 'various', 'personal', 'relationships', 'Dunne', 'stear', 'one', 'best', 'pupils', 'Dre', 'away', 'Frank', 'small-time', 'drug', 'dealer', 'Dre', 'single-parent', 'household', 'mother', 'away', 'most', 'time', 'father', 'never', 'only', 'strong', 'male', 'presence', 'life', 'other', 'Dunne', 'Frank', 'drug', 'dealer', 'More', 'character-driven', 'plot-driven', 'movie', 'out', 'good', 'then', 'just', 'wanders', 'elaborate', 'thought', 'first', '45', 'minutes', 'were', 'very', 'well-done', 'showed', 'how', 'Dunne', 'natural', 'leader', 'classroom', 'even', 'principal', 'none', 'too', 'happy', 'lack', 'sticking', 'assigned', 'curriculum', 'addition', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'documentary-style', 'drama', 'vein', 'ofBloody', 'SundayorUnited', '93', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'felt', 'was', 'fly', 'wall', 'observing', 'lives', 'Dan', 'Dre', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'focus', 'second', 'half', 'kept', 'expecting', 'kind', 'development', 'happen', 'never', 'did', 'Is', 'going', 'be', 'movie', 'how', 'Dunne', 'personal', 'demons', 'hint', 'was', ""n't"", 'explored', 'enough', 'be', 'convincing', 'Half', 'Nelson', 'supposed', 'be', 'how', 'bond', 'students', 'angle', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'explored', 'relationship', 'Dre', 'Dre', 'movie', 'move', 'away', 'Frank', 'explored', 'resolution', 'issue', 'was', 'not', 'convincing', 'Finally', 'was', ""n't"", 'looking', 'happy', 'ending', 'end', 'was', 'looking', 'kind', 'closure', 'other', 'words', 'movie', ""n't"", 'end', 'so', 'much', 'Frankly', 'only', 'thing', 'kept', 'movie', 'unraveling', 'was', 'Gosling', 'performance', 'Shareeka', 'Epps', 'who', 'Dre', 'definitely', 'promising', 'not', 'Gosling', 'league.Overall', 'would', 'say', 'Half', 'Nelson', 'worth', 'watching', 'particularly', 'enjoy', 'dramas', 'inner', 'city', 'schools', 'drug', 'addiction', 'viewers', 'left-wing', 'persuasion', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'pleased', 'Dunne', 'teaching', 'students', 'dialectical', 'method', 'history', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'disappointed', '2nd', 'half', 'movie', 'give', 'strong', 'recommendation']",N/A

Drey's mom wants to raise good kids but is hobbled by a punishing workload and absence of her husband. Crack heads do what they have to do to get their next fix.The story has an inevitability that unreels slowly and is all too real.

I like the way the movie didn't try to ""explain"" everything like why Dan was addicted to crack and how he got on the path to ruin.  I do agree that Ryan should have won the Oscar.  Though I hope he never has to play so anguished a part again (looks like he's signed up for the new Peter Jackson film of THE LOVELY BONES so my hope is shot).  (Watch out, he'll be making that same gesture of anguish he's used from the beginning of his career--watch for it--squinching up his eyes while simultaneously pulling at his nose with his fist.  In HALF NELSON he does it eleven times, or approximately once every reel.)[SPOILERS INVOLVED.)So what's my beef?  I don't know, after thinking about it I was just sort of lackluster.  I didn't like that uncomfortable gulp after the movie when you're thinking, ""Gee, am I dumb, or did they call the movie HALF NELSON for some reason I completely missed?""  I didn't like the suggestions of romance between the teen girl and her teacher.  The ending scene was pretty outrageous in this regard, setting them up as a couple with a future filled with possibility.  It was the traditional happy ending--for a romance movie.  Certainly Ryan had more chemistry with Shareeka Epps than he did with his old girlfriend, played by Tina Holmes.  Other reviewers have praised Tina Holmes for her luminosity.  But me and my wife were sitting there and when she came on screen we debated whether or not to turn off the tape.  ""Oh let's keep it on, maybe she won't be in the movie long.""  She isn't, but she nearly sinks it.  It's not just that she can't act in the traditional sense, but it's also that we keep remembering her from her role in SIX FEET UNDER, where she played James Cromwell's daughter, Maggie, the sweet little thing whose butter wouldnn't melt in her mouth but who stole Nate right from under Brenda's nose on the even of their wedding, then killed him!(SPOILERS OVER.)Plus, isn't she about 10 years older than Ryan?  I thought they were supposed to be high school sweethearts--maybe she was his teacher like Nicole Kidman in TO DIE FOR.  That would explain the haunted look in her eyes, as though regretting the past when she had seduced this underage teen Romeo.  That same haunted look was also shared by another actress, Karen Chilton, the woman who plays Drey's mother, the security guard who works too many shifts to give her daughter any guidance.  All she does is stare out the window looking haunted.  The director, Ryan Fleck, must have called her and Tina Holmes into his office at the same time and handed them each the same notes, ""Look haunted.""But enough complaints.  Overall the movie is worth watching, if a bit painful and overdetermined.  The acting is good, even Tina Holmes, that maneater, is good.  People complain that Ryan and Shareeka were robbed of Oscars, but their time will come!  The most underappreciated performance in my eyes goes to the pair of jockey shorts Ryan Gosling in the film's staggering opening sequence where we see Ryan, still drugged up from the night before, sprawled on the floor of his shabby apartment.  The strain on those shorts must have been incredible and yet, they made it all the way through the scene.  They should have won the 2005 Emdurance Award for holding so much coiled power.",4,Nelson's Column,1186099200,"08 3, 2007",2007,3564,"['loved', 'was', 'month', 'later', 'find', 'dismissing', 'much', 'what', 'felt', 'time', 'month', 'away', 'now', 'say', 'yes', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'was', 'great', 'so', 'was', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'p', 'Drey', 'student', 'Anthony', 'Mackie', 'greatest', 'actor', 'generation', 'way', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'explain', 'everything', 'why', 'Dan', 'was', 'addicted', 'crack', 'how', 'got', 'path', 'ruin', 'do', 'agree', 'Ryan', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'Oscar', 'hope', 'never', 'play', 'so', 'anguished', 'part', 'again', 'signed', 'up', 'new', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'film', 'THE', 'LOVELY', 'BONES', 'hope', 'shot', 'Watch', 'out', ""'ll"", 'be', 'making', 'same', 'gesture', 'anguish', 'used', 'beginning', 'career', 'watch', 'squinching', 'up', 'eyes', 'simultaneously', 'pulling', 'nose', 'fist', 'HALF', 'NELSON', 'eleven', 'times', 'approximately', 'once', 'reel', '[', 'SPOILERS', 'INVOLVED', 'what', 'beef', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'thinking', 'was', 'just', 'sort', 'lackluster', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'uncomfortable', 'gulp', 'movie', 'when', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'Gee', 'am', 'dumb', 'did', 'call', 'movie', 'HALF', 'NELSON', 'reason', 'completely', 'missed', 'did', ""n't"", 'suggestions', 'romance', 'teen', 'girl', 'teacher', 'ending', 'scene', 'was', 'pretty', 'outrageous', 'regard', 'setting', 'up', 'couple', 'future', 'filled', 'possibility', 'was', 'traditional', 'happy', 'ending', 'romance', 'movie', 'Certainly', 'Ryan', 'had', 'more', 'chemistry', 'Shareeka', 'Epps', 'did', 'old', 'girlfriend', 'played', 'Tina', 'Holmes', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'praised', 'Tina', 'Holmes', 'luminosity', 'wife', 'were', 'sitting', 'there', 'when', 'came', 'screen', 'debated', 'not', 'turn', 'off', 'tape', 'Oh', 'let', 'keep', 'maybe', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'movie', 'long', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'sinks', 'not', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'traditional', 'sense', 'also', 'keep', 'remembering', 'role', 'SIX', 'FEET', 'UNDER', 'where', 'played', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'daughter', 'Maggie', 'sweet', 'little', 'thing', 'butter', 'wouldn', ""n't"", 'melt', 'mouth', 'who', 'stole', 'Nate', 'right', 'Brenda', 'nose', 'even', 'wedding', 'then', 'killed', 'SPOILERS', 'OVER', ""n't"", '10', 'years', 'older', 'Ryan', 'thought', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'high', 'school', 'sweethearts', 'maybe', 'was', 'teacher', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'TO', 'DIE', 'FOR', 'would', 'explain', 'haunted', 'look', 'eyes', 'regretting', 'past', 'when', 'had', 'seduced', 'underage', 'teen', 'Romeo', 'same', 'haunted', 'look', 'was', 'also', 'shared', 'actress', 'Karen', 'Chilton', 'woman', 'who', 'Drey', 'mother', 'security', 'guard', 'who', 'too', 'many', 'shifts', 'give', 'daughter', 'guidance', 'stare', 'out', 'window', 'looking', 'haunted', 'director', 'Ryan', 'Fleck', 'must', 'have', 'called', 'Tina', 'Holmes', 'office', 'same', 'time', 'handed', 'same', 'notes', 'Look', 'haunted', 'enough', 'complaints', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'bit', 'painful', 'overdetermined', 'acting', 'good', 'even', 'Tina', 'Holmes', 'maneater', 'good', 'People', 'complain', 'Ryan', 'Shareeka', 'were', 'robbed', 'Oscars', 'time', 'will', 'come', 'most', 'underappreciated', 'performance', 'eyes', 'pair', 'jockey', 'shorts', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'film', 'staggering', 'opening', 'sequence', 'where', 'see', 'Ryan', 'still', 'drugged', 'up', 'night', 'sprawled', 'floor', 'shabby', 'apartment', 'strain', 'shorts', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'incredible', 'yet', 'made', 'way', 'scene', 'should', 'have', 'won', '2005', 'Emdurance', 'Award', 'holding', 'so', 'much', 'coiled', 'power']",N/A

And I admire that he is still choosing to work in independent, meaningful films. He's come a long way from his days as a Mouseketeer. I contend that if ""The Believer"" had not been dismissed from Academy consideration due to a technicality, he could have made a serious bid for a Best Actor nomination several years ago. Even his work in more conventional films like ""The Notebook"" and ""Murder By Numbers"" is noteworthy and raises the quality of those productions.""Half Nelson"" is a small film about real people struggling with real problems. Shareeka Epps stars as Drey in a very straightforward, natural performance. She is growing up with the fear that she will become like her brother. He became entrenched in the world of drugs and is currently serving time. There is almost a feeling of inevitability, this is her world and she is incapable of escaping it. Gosling's Dan, on the other hand, is a semi-functioning drug addict who is her teacher. There is a helplessness to his life as well--he shows very little interest in actually changing his situation. But while he doesn't feel as if he can save himself, he channels that concern into saving Drey. And where she can't change her own circumstances, she makes a connection with Dan.It's an interesting dynamic, one that isn't often portrayed. And the closeness of their bond can be somewhat unsettling in that they are teacher/student, male/female, adult/child. It's not an easy relationship to form under ordinary circumstances.There are no major revelations by the characters in ""Half Nelson"". No major confrontations, no climactic scene, no tidy ending. It's just two characters quietly drawn to each other and gaining strength, however fleetingly, from that association. You're left to ponder what will happen with these characters once the film has ended. You may have a glimmer of hope, but realistically you know it's going to be an uphill battle. Ultimately the movie's realism, and lack of an answer, are it's strongest asset. Life doesn't come in tidy packages for any of us.

1036528,A22TZUXUKA11SQ,B000KX0IOK,"K. Hinton ""avid reader""","[2, 3]","Half Nelson is the story about the unlikely friendship between a drug-addicted teacher and a misguided student. Ryan Gosling plays Dan Dunn, a history teacher and basketball coach who attempts to think outside the box when teaching his students about the civil rights movement. Unfortunately, most of the time his lectures come across as mindless rambling, and I personally wondered what he could possibly put on a test that would make any sense with his lectures about opposites and dialectics. Dan lives a pretty solitary life, alone with his cat and his addiction. When one of his students, Drey, catches him smoking crack in the bathroom, they strike up a friendship based on their joint secret. Drey tries to watch out for Dan, while he does the same for her, even going as far as telling his drug dealer, and her incarcerated brother's friend, to stay away from her because she's a good kid. Hypocrisy is ripe with this film.Half Nelson isn't the sort of movie that you need to watch if you're in the mood for something light and upbeat. It's depressing at worst, and enlightening at best. The friendship that blooms between Dan and Drey is at the heart of the film, and its development is what makes the film worth watching. But it's hard to tell what we're supposed to take away from this film. Her teacher is a crackhead, but as long as she stays with him he won't use around her--is that any reason for a teenage girl to have to take care of a grown man who is supposed to be leading by example. His student has potential and, though he's too far gone to save himself, he can maybe just save her. Does that excuse the inherent hypocrisy in asking your own drug dealer to stay away from someone he's known longer and more closely? It's hard to know where to put this film. It's hard to know what the message is supposed to be. The film's plot took forever to get going and then it ended abruptly and with little explanation, but I liked it anyway. I don't think Half Nelson is the sort of movie that everyone will enjoy, but if you're willing to accept the fact that questions are left unanswered and you're the sort of person who can draw your own conclusions without having a message drawn out for you, I think you'll enjoy it.",4,"It's hard to know where to put this film, but I liked it nonetheless",1174262400,"03 19, 2007",2007,2238,"['Half', 'Nelson', 'story', 'unlikely', 'friendship', 'drug-addicted', 'teacher', 'misguided', 'student', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'Dan', 'Dunn', 'history', 'teacher', 'basketball', 'coach', 'who', 'think', 'box', 'when', 'teaching', 'students', 'civil', 'rights', 'movement', 'Unfortunately', 'most', 'time', 'lectures', 'come', 'mindless', 'rambling', 'personally', 'wondered', 'what', 'could', 'possibly', 'put', 'test', 'would', 'make', 'sense', 'lectures', 'opposites', 'dialectics', 'Dan', 'pretty', 'solitary', 'life', 'alone', 'cat', 'addiction', 'When', 'one', 'students', 'Drey', 'smoking', 'crack', 'bathroom', 'strike', 'up', 'friendship', 'based', 'joint', 'secret', 'Drey', 'watch', 'out', 'Dan', 'same', 'even', 'going', 'as', 'far', 'telling', 'drug', 'dealer', 'incarcerated', 'brother', 'friend', 'stay', 'away', 'good', 'kid', 'Hypocrisy', 'ripe', 'film.Half', 'Nelson', ""n't"", 'sort', 'movie', 'need', 'watch', ""'re"", 'mood', 'something', 'light', 'upbeat', 'depressing', 'worst', 'enlightening', 'best', 'friendship', 'Dan', 'Drey', 'heart', 'film', 'development', 'what', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'hard', 'tell', 'what', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'take', 'away', 'film', 'teacher', 'crackhead', 'as', 'long', 'wo', ""n't"", 'use', 'reason', 'teenage', 'girl', 'have', 'take', 'care', 'grown', 'man', 'who', 'supposed', 'be', 'leading', 'example', 'student', 'potential', 'too', 'far', 'gone', 'save', 'can', 'maybe', 'just', 'save', 'excuse', 'inherent', 'hypocrisy', 'asking', 'own', 'drug', 'dealer', 'stay', 'away', 'someone', 'known', 'longer', 'more', 'closely', 'hard', 'know', 'where', 'put', 'film', 'hard', 'know', 'what', 'message', 'supposed', 'be', 'film', 'plot', 'took', 'forever', 'get', 'going', 'then', 'ended', 'abruptly', 'little', 'explanation', 'liked', 'anyway', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Half', 'Nelson', 'sort', 'movie', 'everyone', 'will', 'enjoy', ""'re"", 'willing', 'accept', 'fact', 'questions', 'are', 'left', 'unanswered', ""'re"", 'sort', 'person', 'who', 'can', 'draw', 'own', 'conclusions', 'having', 'message', 'drawn', 'out', 'think', ""'ll"", 'enjoy']",N/A
1036529,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000KX0IOK,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[0, 0]","I check out ""Half Nelson"" because Ryan Gosling received an Oscar nomination for his performance, but when I sat down to actually watch the film I knew nothing else about the film (I was going to say that I did not remember the clip they showed of him at the Academy Awards when they did the Best Actor nominees, but suddenly I cannot remember if they even bother to do that anymore). So, while watching the movie by initial question was ""What is this movie about?"" That becomes a pivotal question because until the final scene, I could not really answer it because ""Half Nelson"" is a film that seems like it is going to be about several things other than what it ends up being about. At the end I was surprised, and pleasantly so, to find what I thought was the point.Gosling plays Dan Dunne, who is teaching history to eighth graders and coaching girls basketball in a Brooklyn junior high school. Each spring I watch Ken Burns' ""Baseball"" and when they get to the Dodgers leaving for Los Angeles in the late 1950s one of the points made was that the borough of Brooklyn had been transformed into a predominantly black community. So Dan's students are black and Hispanic. Then one of Dan's 13-year-old students, Drey (Shareeka Epps), catches him doing drugs after school one day after basketball practice. The rest of their film is basically about the relationship been Dan and Drey, with the exact nature of that relationship being open to interpretation, mainly because we cannot help but anticipate myriad ways in which this could all end badly. Drey's mother is an overworked single mother, which means that Drey has had to grow up pretty much on her own, which explains in part her attitude towards the world in general and Dan in particular.I have been teaching over half my life now and I watched this 2006 film from that occupational psychosis (as Kenneth Burke would label it), even though I cannot really say that director Ryan Fleck and his partner Anna Boden are making a movie that is primarily about teaching. Dan is a teacher and Drey is his student, but most of what is significant about their lives and their relationship clearly happens outside of the classroom. The chicken or the egg quandary here is which came first, Dan's drug habit or his failings as a teacher. To be fair, it is not that there is obvious evidence of Dan's failure in the classroom, even though the principal is on his case about his refusal to stick to the curriculum, especially telling when it is on a unit about the Civil Rights movement. His students seem enthralled by his insistence on the importance of understanding the dialectics of history, but we never get a sense that this is having an actual impact on their lives or at least their appreciation of history. They are bits where the students recite about some choice bit of American history, but one time a student immediately looks off camera and wonders if what they just said was really true, which might be just a joke, but it also undercuts the idea of Dan's effectiveness in the classroom. Of course I am eager to add to the problem because I keep coming up with ways that Dan can get his students truly excited about the oppositional forces he cares so much about.The third most important character in the film turns out to be Frank (Anthony Mackie), a neighborhood drug dealer with whom Dan has done business. Frank is related to Drey's family, so when Dan objects to Frank getting friendly with Drey and wants to rescue her, it creates a nexus of (you guessed it) oppositional forces. It also brings things to a head and what I really like about this movie is that it resolves both the conflict between Dan and Frank, as well as the relationship between Dan and Drey, in ways that I did not anticipate. I would say that the problem with ""Half Nelson"" is that it spends a lot of time skating close to assorted melodramatic plot lines while charting its own course. This is a movie that I think you will enjoy more the second time around when you can stop being distracted by what the film is not about to enjoy how it does set up its true thesis. You can still appreciate the performance by Gosling, doing a decidedly different take on a drug addict, but you will also applaud how Epps more than holds her own in their scenes together.",4,"Be forewarned that ""Half Nelson"" is not really about what it seems to be about",1176595200,"04 15, 2007",2007,4298,"['check', 'Half', 'Nelson', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'received', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'performance', 'when', 'sat', 'down', 'actually', 'watch', 'film', 'knew', 'nothing', 'else', 'film', 'was', 'going', 'say', 'did', 'not', 'remember', 'clip', 'showed', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'when', 'did', 'Best', 'Actor', 'nominees', 'suddenly', 'can', 'not', 'remember', 'even', 'bother', 'do', 'anymore', 'So', 'watching', 'movie', 'initial', 'question', 'was', 'What', 'movie', 'pivotal', 'question', 'final', 'scene', 'could', 'not', 'really', 'answer', 'Half', 'Nelson', 'film', 'going', 'be', 'several', 'things', 'other', 'what', 'up', 'being', 'end', 'was', 'surprised', 'pleasantly', 'so', 'find', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'point.Gosling', 'Dan', 'Dunne', 'who', 'teaching', 'history', 'eighth', 'graders', 'coaching', 'girls', 'basketball', 'Brooklyn', 'junior', 'high', 'school', 'spring', 'watch', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'Baseball', 'when', 'get', 'Dodgers', 'leaving', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'late', '1950s', 'one', 'points', 'made', 'was', 'borough', 'Brooklyn', 'had', 'been', 'transformed', 'predominantly', 'black', 'community', 'So', 'Dan', 'students', 'are', 'black', 'Hispanic', 'Then', 'one', 'Dan', '13-year-old', 'students', 'Drey', 'Shareeka', 'Epps', 'doing', 'drugs', 'school', 'one', 'day', 'basketball', 'practice', 'rest', 'film', 'basically', 'relationship', 'been', 'Dan', 'Drey', 'exact', 'nature', 'relationship', 'being', 'open', 'interpretation', 'mainly', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'anticipate', 'myriad', 'ways', 'could', 'end', 'badly', 'Drey', 'mother', 'overworked', 'single', 'mother', 'Drey', 'had', 'grow', 'up', 'pretty', 'much', 'own', 'part', 'attitude', 'world', 'general', 'Dan', 'particular.I', 'have', 'been', 'teaching', 'life', 'now', 'watched', '2006', 'film', 'occupational', 'psychosis', 'Kenneth', 'Burke', 'would', 'label', 'even', 'can', 'not', 'really', 'say', 'director', 'Ryan', 'Fleck', 'partner', 'Anna', 'Boden', 'are', 'making', 'movie', 'primarily', 'teaching', 'Dan', 'teacher', 'Drey', 'student', 'most', 'what', 'significant', 'lives', 'relationship', 'clearly', 'classroom', 'chicken', 'egg', 'quandary', 'here', 'came', 'first', 'Dan', 'drug', 'habit', 'failings', 'teacher', 'be', 'fair', 'not', 'obvious', 'evidence', 'Dan', 'failure', 'classroom', 'even', 'principal', 'case', 'refusal', 'stick', 'curriculum', 'especially', 'telling', 'when', 'unit', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'movement', 'students', 'seem', 'enthralled', 'insistence', 'importance', 'understanding', 'dialectics', 'history', 'never', 'get', 'sense', 'having', 'actual', 'impact', 'lives', 'least', 'appreciation', 'history', 'are', 'bits', 'where', 'students', 'recite', 'choice', 'bit', 'American', 'history', 'one', 'time', 'student', 'immediately', 'camera', 'wonders', 'what', 'just', 'said', 'was', 'really', 'true', 'might', 'be', 'just', 'joke', 'also', 'idea', 'Dan', 'effectiveness', 'classroom', 'course', 'am', 'eager', 'add', 'problem', 'keep', 'coming', 'up', 'ways', 'Dan', 'can', 'get', 'students', 'truly', 'excited', 'oppositional', 'forces', 'so', 'much', 'third', 'most', 'important', 'character', 'film', 'out', 'be', 'Frank', 'Anthony', 'Mackie', 'neighborhood', 'drug', 'dealer', 'whom', 'Dan', 'done', 'business', 'Frank', 'related', 'Drey', 'family', 'so', 'when', 'Dan', 'Frank', 'getting', 'friendly', 'Drey', 'rescue', 'nexus', 'guessed', 'oppositional', 'forces', 'also', 'things', 'head', 'what', 'really', 'like', 'movie', 'conflict', 'Dan', 'Frank', 'as', 'well', 'relationship', 'Dan', 'Drey', 'ways', 'did', 'not', 'anticipate', 'would', 'say', 'problem', 'Half', 'Nelson', 'lot', 'time', 'skating', 'close', 'assorted', 'melodramatic', 'plot', 'lines', 'charting', 'own', 'course', 'movie', 'think', 'will', 'enjoy', 'more', 'second', 'time', 'around', 'when', 'can', 'stop', 'being', 'distracted', 'what', 'film', 'not', 'enjoy', 'how', 'set', 'up', 'true', 'thesis', 'can', 'still', 'appreciate', 'performance', 'Gosling', 'doing', 'decidedly', 'different', 'take', 'drug', 'addict', 'will', 'also', 'applaud', 'how', 'Epps', 'more', 'own', 'scenes', 'together']",N/A

We see the young teacher Dan Dunne who is handsome and a dedicated teacher in a poor school.  However, his personal life has fallen apart with his drug use.  In the hands of another actor, the film would have been harder to watch.  Ryan Gosling was nominated for Best Actor for the film and won the honor for his Breakthrough Performance from the National Board of Review.  He is befriended by his student Drey who seems to idolize her teacher, but then finds him smoking crack cocaine.  Drey is played by Shareeka Epps who was also in the film short.  She won Best Supporting Actress awards from the Boston Society of Film Critics and the New York Film Critics Society.  It is a sensitive portrayal.  Then Drey starts dealing; and we see her imperfection.  Tina Holmes plays Rachel in the film and finds it hard to be with Dan.  We see Dan's family, Drey's family, and many of the students in the school.  Each is a product of their circumstances and their choices.  I thought the film ended on a positive note as Dunne shaves his scraggly beard.  Perhaps he has hit bottom and will start to pull himself together.  The film was named Best Picture by the American Film Institute.  It is difficult to watch in spots.  It speaks to the frailty and magnificence that lie side by side in each of us.

This is the concept Fleck wanted to convey in this film, and he's done that, for sure.As schoolteacher Dan Dunne, Ryan Gosling is superb, playing a young man who simultaneously challenges his inner city history students with concepts no other teacher would even dare think of (Hegel's dialectics), yet at the same time addicted to freebase crack cocaine. When one of his students, Drey (Shareeka Epps), discovers his addiction, an unusual relationship develops between the two, made all the more powerful by the fact that Drey is not your usual inner city student, but really smart--both intellectually and streetwise.In many movies, it would be the male lead that carries the film; thus, in Half Nelson, the viewer is initially expecting that Gosling will be the primary focus and shoulder the burden of insuring that the scenes are as strong as they can be. But that's not the case here. While Gosling is indeed extremely good in his role, newcomer Shareeka Epps is brilliant, just as strong if not stronger than Gosling in screen presence, and carrying way more than her share of the responsibility for this being a four-star movie.The third wheel is Anthony Mackie who plays a friendly drug dealer in the movie's setting, south central Los Angeles, and while he's also very good, it's really Epps and Gosling who drive Half Nelson. Mackie's character helps out Drey because Drey's brother is in jail and is a good friend of the drug dealer. Ironically, Drey's mother is a security guard.Schoolteacher Dunne more than recognizes the irony of him teaching dialectics, one of whose central concepts is the synthesis of opposites, to a class of kids who are subjected to the temptations of weakness every day. The irony, of course, is that Dunne himself is a convergence of strength and weakness--great teacher and also drug addict. And, as we see, Drey herself embodies this convergence as well, although not to the same extent that Dan does. She's a tough kid, but also recognizes the good in people. She knows Dan is good, but at the same time sees his weakness. She herself knows what good is, but at the same time engages in behavior that she ultimately sees as bad.This is a superior film, a riveting character study in which the two leads know exactly who their characters are--know exactly what, in fact, the complexities of those characters are--and play them brilliantly.Highly recommended.",4,The convergence of strength and weakness,1202083200,"02 4, 2008",2008,2716,"['interesting', 'self-penned', 'piece', 'making', 'film', 'appeared', 'IFC', 'Independent', 'Film', 'Channel', 'magazine', '2006', 'director', 'Ryan', 'Fleck', 'talks', 'film', 'title', 'mentioning', 'half-nelson', 'wrestling', 'position', 'grappler', 'whom', 'position', 'imposed', 'hope', 'escape', 'concept', 'Fleck', 'wanted', 'convey', 'film', 'done', 'sure.As', 'schoolteacher', 'Dan', 'Dunne', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'superb', 'playing', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'simultaneously', 'inner', 'city', 'history', 'students', 'concepts', 'other', 'teacher', 'would', 'even', 'dare', 'think', 'Hegel', 'dialectics', 'yet', 'same', 'time', 'addicted', 'freebase', 'crack', 'cocaine', 'When', 'one', 'students', 'Drey', 'Shareeka', 'Epps', 'addiction', 'unusual', 'relationship', 'two', 'made', 'more', 'powerful', 'fact', 'Drey', 'not', 'usual', 'inner', 'city', 'student', 'really', 'smart', 'intellectually', 'streetwise.In', 'many', 'movies', 'would', 'be', 'male', 'lead', 'film', 'thus', 'Half', 'Nelson', 'viewer', 'initially', 'expecting', 'Gosling', 'will', 'be', 'primary', 'focus', 'shoulder', 'burden', 'insuring', 'scenes', 'are', 'as', 'strong', 'can', 'be', 'not', 'case', 'here', 'Gosling', 'indeed', 'extremely', 'good', 'role', 'newcomer', 'Shareeka', 'Epps', 'brilliant', 'just', 'strong', 'not', 'stronger', 'Gosling', 'screen', 'presence', 'carrying', 'way', 'more', 'share', 'responsibility', 'being', 'four-star', 'movie.The', 'third', 'wheel', 'Anthony', 'Mackie', 'who', 'friendly', 'drug', 'dealer', 'movie', 'setting', 'south', 'central', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'really', 'Epps', 'Gosling', 'who', 'drive', 'Half', 'Nelson', 'Mackie', 'character', 'out', 'Drey', 'Drey', 'brother', 'jail', 'good', 'friend', 'drug', 'dealer', 'Ironically', 'Drey', 'mother', 'security', 'guard.Schoolteacher', 'Dunne', 'more', 'irony', 'teaching', 'dialectics', 'one', 'central', 'concepts', 'synthesis', 'opposites', 'class', 'kids', 'who', 'are', 'subjected', 'temptations', 'weakness', 'day', 'irony', 'course', 'Dunne', 'convergence', 'strength', 'weakness', 'great', 'teacher', 'also', 'drug', 'addict', 'see', 'Drey', 'convergence', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'same', 'extent', 'Dan', 'tough', 'kid', 'also', 'good', 'people', 'Dan', 'good', 'same', 'time', 'weakness', 'what', 'good', 'same', 'time', 'behavior', 'ultimately', 'bad.This', 'superior', 'film', 'riveting', 'character', 'study', 'two', 'leads', 'know', 'exactly', 'who', 'characters', 'are', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'fact', 'complexities', 'characters', 'are', 'play', 'brilliantly.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

Well, I don't know what to say except they never have been teaching in the inner city. The alcoholic professor is as much a stereotype as the substance abusing teacher. They bring baggage to the job of ""teaching."" Here, Gosling is absolutely remarkable in his performance as a powder then crack cocaine user who is also a brilliant teacher. His connection to his kids unrealistic? Let me tell you it is his style of teaching that gets through to them. Throughout the film you will see his kids reciting parts of black history that he has taught them, despite thefact that his  principal is upset that he is not on a certain page in the lesson plan. Lord, you who are teachers like I am know how brilliantly true this is! Dunn is a creative, committed teacher who finds remarkable ways to reach his students. One wonderful scene has him trying to explain to a couple of coke ho's why he teaches: one girl says, o so if you get through to one, you get through to all, huh? Gosling's expression is priceless (btw, he is one heck of an actor). No, he murmurs, if you get through to one .... (you have reached one). In his dialogue, however, he never finishes the line.The backdrop of his family life explains a lot, as does Dre's. And I think this is what ultimately draws them to each other; not that they know about each other's past/present, but they sense they have a kinship. The lovely reciprocal-caretaker theme also suggests they are kindred spirits.There is no lack of resolution at the end. The scene IS the resolution. Dre has just persuaded Dunn to clean up his room and his personal hygiene. ""You missed a spot,"" she tells him. Then sitting down on opposite ends of the sofa, they smile shyly at one another, acknowledging their bond.

1036533,A1TJPMB7N776WS,B000KX0IOK,MICHAEL ACUNA,"[70, 75]","For several years now I have been waiting for Ryan Gosling to fulfill the promise that he exhibited in his revolutionary performance in ""The Believer."" Films have come and gone and in most of them he has been giving good performances (""Murder by Numbers"") and problematic ones (""The Notebook"") but always with a sense of who he is as an actor and more importantly how he can use his talent and his very being to bring the story of the character he is playing alive.Now with his Dan Dunne, Gosling has finally fulfilled that promise and his Dunne is complicated (a terrific, human, enabling and encouraging high school teacher who is also a cocaine free-baser), sensitive to a fault, sexually aware...basically a talented, educated, addicted man from a loving family that can't help but fall victim to the baser parts of his nature. He is upright, strong, smart, loving but can't help but call on the appeal of drugs to douse the raging fire of indecision and self-hatred burning deep inside of him. A fire that director/writers Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden choose not to explicitly reveal, though after a Dunne family dinner we are perhaps given some hints into Dan Dunne's upbringing and politically committed family and therefore the genesis of his addiction.Fleck and Boden give us expositional information in a very interesting way here particularly the juxtaposition, the flipping back and forth of the images between the Dunne family dinner (ex-hippie parents, socially and politically committed brother and his girlfriend... eating, drinking bottles and bottles of wine) and Dunne's student and friend Drey's evening home with family: filling small plastic bags with cocaine, chatting about her brother in jail...all polite and ordinary. But honestly: which family situation is best, which family situation is the most comforting for Dan and Drey. This masterful scene goes on for quite a long time and yet Fleck and Boden refuse to comment, refuse to put one family in a better light than the other.Besides Gosling, there are a couple of actresses here that deserve special note. One, in a small role, though she appeared in both ""Six Feet Under"" and ""Taken,"" Tina Holmes as Goslings ex and a former addict's very presence on the screen brings a certain weight and gravity to this film and of course to her role. Holmes is all sly, shy smiles, small gestures (she does more with an eye crinkle than do most with long involved scenes) and an inherent honesty and vulnerability that makes your heart hurt. She actually steals her very first scene with Gosling by under acting and the sheer luminosity of her performance.Secondly, Shareeka Epps as Drey is amazing: she has an old soul, and like Holmes a gravity and a basic honesty that sets her apart from others in her family and the other students in this film. As her jailed brothers friend Frank (the excellent Anthony Mackie) says of Drey's friendship with Dunne: ""It is inappropriate."" But you know what, as presented and implemented in this film...it isn't. It's strange, it's rife with possible problems, it's audacious for sure but it's also the life preserver that saves both Dunne and Drey... it's their redemption.",5,Dan and Drey,1158451200,"09 17, 2006",2006,3179,"['several', 'years', 'now', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'fulfill', 'promise', 'exhibited', 'revolutionary', 'performance', 'Believer', 'Films', 'have', 'come', 'gone', 'most', 'been', 'giving', 'good', 'performances', 'Murder', 'Numbers', 'problematic', 'ones', 'Notebook', 'always', 'sense', 'who', 'actor', 'more', 'importantly', 'how', 'can', 'use', 'talent', 'very', 'being', 'bring', 'story', 'character', 'playing', 'alive.Now', 'Dan', 'Dunne', 'Gosling', 'finally', 'fulfilled', 'promise', 'Dunne', 'complicated', 'terrific', 'human', 'enabling', 'encouraging', 'high', 'school', 'teacher', 'who', 'also', 'cocaine', 'free-baser', 'sensitive', 'fault', 'sexually', 'aware', 'basically', 'talented', 'educated', 'addicted', 'man', 'loving', 'family', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'fall', 'victim', 'baser', 'parts', 'nature', 'upright', 'strong', 'smart', 'loving', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'call', 'appeal', 'drugs', 'douse', 'raging', 'fire', 'indecision', 'self-hatred', 'burning', 'deep', 'inside', 'fire', 'director/writers', 'Ryan', 'Fleck', 'Anna', 'Boden', 'choose', 'not', 'explicitly', 'reveal', 'though', 'Dunne', 'family', 'dinner', 'are', 'perhaps', 'given', 'hints', 'Dan', 'Dunne', 'upbringing', 'politically', 'committed', 'family', 'therefore', 'genesis', 'addiction.Fleck', 'Boden', 'give', 'expositional', 'information', 'very', 'interesting', 'way', 'here', 'particularly', 'juxtaposition', 'flipping', 'back', 'forth', 'images', 'Dunne', 'family', 'dinner', 'ex-hippie', 'parents', 'socially', 'politically', 'committed', 'brother', 'girlfriend', 'eating', 'drinking', 'bottles', 'bottles', 'wine', 'Dunne', 'student', 'friend', 'Drey', 'evening', 'home', 'family', 'filling', 'small', 'plastic', 'bags', 'cocaine', 'chatting', 'brother', 'jail', 'polite', 'ordinary', 'honestly', 'family', 'situation', 'best', 'family', 'situation', 'most', 'comforting', 'Dan', 'Drey', 'masterful', 'scene', 'quite', 'long', 'time', 'yet', 'Fleck', 'Boden', 'refuse', 'comment', 'refuse', 'put', 'one', 'family', 'better', 'light', 'other.Besides', 'Gosling', 'are', 'couple', 'actresses', 'here', 'deserve', 'special', 'note', 'One', 'small', 'role', 'appeared', 'Six', 'Feet', 'Taken', 'Tina', 'Holmes', 'Goslings', 'ex', 'former', 'addict', 'very', 'presence', 'screen', 'certain', 'weight', 'gravity', 'film', 'course', 'role', 'Holmes', 'sly', 'shy', 'smiles', 'small', 'gestures', 'more', 'eye', 'crinkle', 'do', 'most', 'long', 'involved', 'scenes', 'inherent', 'honesty', 'vulnerability', 'heart', 'hurt', 'actually', 'very', 'first', 'scene', 'Gosling', 'acting', 'sheer', 'luminosity', 'performance.Secondly', 'Shareeka', 'Epps', 'Drey', 'amazing', 'old', 'soul', 'Holmes', 'gravity', 'basic', 'honesty', 'apart', 'others', 'family', 'other', 'students', 'film', 'jailed', 'brothers', 'friend', 'Frank', 'excellent', 'Anthony', 'Mackie', 'Drey', 'friendship', 'Dunne', 'inappropriate', 'know', 'what', 'presented', 'implemented', 'film', ""n't"", 'strange', 'rife', 'possible', 'problems', 'audacious', 'sure', 'also', 'life', 'preserver', 'Dunne', 'Drey', 'redemption']",N/A

1036535,A1FG91CM8221X1,B000KX0IOK,Miles D. Moore,"[7, 10]","Ryan Fleck's ""Half Nelson"" is a film that stands staunchly for the principles of civilization and political empowerment, even as it demonstrates in microcosm just how compromised those principles can become. It is a film that never tells you what to think about the story or the characters, while at the same time demanding that you DO think about them, deeply. This alone is audacious for any American film. The superb, slice-of-life screenplay by Fleck and editor/producer Anna Boden presents Dan Dunne (Ryan Gosling), a history teacher in an inner-city middle school who tries to fill his mostly apathetic students with the leftist zeal he learned from his parents. Unfortunately, Dunne is the living embodiment of the old saying, ""The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak."" His life is sliding downhill, thanks to a raging crack habit.  Nevertheless, he manages to keep his addiction out of the classroom until the day that Drey (Shareeka Epps), his brightest and most admiring pupil, catches him hiding in a toilet stall with his crack pipe. Drey is already an embattled soul; her brother is in jail for drug dealing, and Frank (Anthony Mackie), the neighborhood kingpin, is supporting Drey's family in exchange for her brother taking the fall for him. But this support has strings attached; Frank expects Drey to come into business with him. The brilliance of ""Half Nelson"" is in depicting Dunne and Frank's battle for Drey's soul, as Dunne slowly but surely loses whatever moral authority he possesses. Frank, the representative of urban decay and criminal evil, is a stronger personality than Dunne, and outwardly a more stand-up guy. (The big confrontation scene between the two is deeply sad and ironic.) The story plays out in ways that are fresh and surprising, yet always completely logical given the characters, and the end, though not the gift-wrapped resolution American audiences expect, offers a fragile ray of hope for both Dunne and Drey. A large part of the film's impact comes from the performances of the ensemble cast,which could not possibly be more natural, real, or compelling. Gosling, in particular, nails the contradictions of his character's personality, making the dichotomy between his idealism and his moral turpitude all too believable. Andrij Parekh's jittery, documentary-style camera adds to the you-are-there reality of the film. ""Half Nelson"" is not an easy movie, or one to see in an escapist mood.

It acknowledges, but avoids falling prey to many of the stereotypes about inner city schools, drug users and dealers, and relationships between blacks and whites.

You really can't ask for more, this film is another indication that in spite of the attention given to first weekend grosses of big blockbusters, the heart of American cinema remains in the small independent films that address real issues faced by real people.",4,"Compelling performances, strong script, make this a must-see American independent feature",1187049600,"08 14, 2007",2007,1155,"['very', 'strong', 'film', 'remarkable', 'performances', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'newcomer', 'Shareeka', 'Epps', 'avoids', 'falling', 'prey', 'many', 'stereotypes', 'inner', 'city', 'schools', 'drug', 'users', 'dealers', 'relationships', 'blacks', 'whites', 'not', 'trying', 'prove', 'anything', 'are', 'simple', 'straightforward', 'morals', 'here', 'characters', 'do', 'try', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'succeed', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'film', 'not', 'pretend', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'even', 'when', 'point', 'certain', 'dangers', 'dialogue', 'excellent', 'film', 'good', 'nothing', 'fantastic', 'very', 'competently', 'directed', 'way', 'not', 'draw', 'attention', 'away', 'characters', 'story', 'really', 'point', 'here', 'music', 'strong', 'emotions', 'come', 'story', 'forcing', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ask', 'more', 'film', 'indication', 'spite', 'attention', 'given', 'first', 'weekend', 'grosses', 'big', 'blockbusters', 'heart', 'American', 'cinema', 'small', 'independent', 'films', 'address', 'real', 'issues', 'faced', 'real', 'people']",N/A

So that is why I saw it and that comes with the expectation that the movie will be bad but the performance will be good. As the movie started I felt the exact opposite. The scenes were short and his character was yet undeveloped, but the plot pulled me in; I was very interested in where it would lead. As the movie progressed, the movie did a great job adding depth to Gosling though the plot went in a strange direction.The adult language intensifies towards the end of the film, but the real reason to be wary of Half Nelson is the vivid drug-use scenes. Mr. Dunne's extracuricular chemical dependency is very important to his character and the movie and the creators did not shy away from it. This is not a child-friendly movie and while even I was uncomfortable a few times, I really liked it.I think Ryan Gosling has really put himself on the acting map. This performance and obviously the nomination should really give him the opportunity to establish himself as one of the best young talents in the business. I would love to see him sustain this level of performance.Half Nelson is not for everyone. There is drug abuse and abusive language. Ryan Gosling was deserving of his nomination, and you may become familiar with the name Shareeka Epps after her performance as well. I was hooked early by the story though I had to sort my thoughts out at the end before I realized how much I liked the movie.

We readily discern that he has given up all attempts at trying to reach out and inspire his students to fight against the injustices and misinformation that exist in the world.His mental anguish and desolation and severe alienation, melded with rampant drug use, has nearly destroyed him.His only hope of survival is being inspired by one of his own students, Drey - whom he has made an incongruous connection with - to save himself.As Drey (Shareeka Epps) struggles to accept Dan's failings - in the hope that a friendship with him will help both of them overcome their circumstances - she unwittingly leads Dan further down the path of self-destruction, which can only end with a clarifying moment of salvation or untimely death...Half Nelson is a masterpiece film, emotionally purgative, hypnotically realistic, and soul-shattering; its depiction of people who only experience fleeting moments of happiness in a retrogressive, bleak world is so realistic that it is visually and spiritually and emotionally earth-shattering.",5,Saving Oneself,1171324800,"02 13, 2007",2007,1942,"['Ryan', 'Gosling', 'off-the-charts', 'startling', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'performance', 'Dan', 'Dunne', 'young', 'unhappy', 'man', 'who', 'disenchanted', 'world', 'himself.The', 'camera', 'emotion', 'Dan', 'mind', 'face', 'soul', 'watch', 'spend', 'waking', 'moment', 'pondering', 'life', 'intricate', 'hypocrisies', 'intolerance', 'continuous', 'disappointments', 'watch', 'spend', 'waking', 'moment', 'pondering', 'own', 'personal', 'failings', 'let-downs', 'watch', 'spend', 'waking', 'moment', 'trying', 'escape', 'anguish', 'drug', 'abuse', 'watch', 'spend', 'waking', 'moment', 'mentally', 'physically', 'punishing', 'failings', 'engaging', 'drug', 'abuse.In', 'addition', 'abuse', 'drugs', 'emotional', 'decline', 'accelerated', 'career', 'history', 'teacher', 'coach', 'inner-city', 'run-down', 'school', 'where', 'few', 'students', 'graduate', 'highschool', 'let', 'alone', 'advance', 'college', 'readily', 'discern', 'given', 'up', 'attempts', 'trying', 'reach', 'out', 'inspire', 'students', 'fight', 'injustices', 'misinformation', 'exist', 'world.His', 'mental', 'anguish', 'desolation', 'severe', 'alienation', 'melded', 'rampant', 'drug', 'use', 'nearly', 'destroyed', 'him.His', 'only', 'hope', 'survival', 'being', 'inspired', 'one', 'own', 'students', 'Drey', 'whom', 'made', 'incongruous', 'connection', 'save', 'himself.As', 'Drey', 'Shareeka', 'Epps', 'accept', 'Dan', 'failings', 'hope', 'friendship', 'will', 'help', 'overcome', 'circumstances', 'unwittingly', 'Dan', 'further', 'down', 'path', 'self-destruction', 'can', 'only', 'end', 'clarifying', 'moment', 'salvation', 'untimely', 'death', 'Half', 'Nelson', 'masterpiece', 'film', 'emotionally', 'purgative', 'hypnotically', 'realistic', 'soul-shattering', 'depiction', 'people', 'who', 'only', 'experience', 'fleeting', 'moments', 'happiness', 'retrogressive', 'bleak', 'world', 'so', 'realistic', 'visually', 'spiritually', 'emotionally', 'earth-shattering']",N/A

I found this to be a pretty slow moving film.  It had a tendency to drag on and on--especially the classroom scenes.  A good work of art needs variation: fast/slow, loud/quiet, bright/dark, etc.  This film was too slow and too quiet.  Very monotone.  That was the flaw in the directing.  As for the writing, I found the classroom scenes totally unbelievable.  As an inner-city, secondary school teacher myself, let me tell you--I have never seen such well behaved students.  Even if they did like their teacher.  Where was the talking back to the teacher, verbal disagreements amongst the students, fights in the classroom, throwing paper at the teacher, etc.?  For a while I thought this classroom took play at Dalton prep school on the upper East Side of New York than an African-American/Latino neighborhood of Brooklyn.  These kids are coming from broken homes with family members in jail and drugs right around the corner.  You don't think they're going to bring some of that garbage into the classroom?  Well, I sure didn't see it in this film.  I found the family dinner scene unnecessary.  What was the point of it?  To explain how Don became a substance abuse addict like his father and a cynic like his mother.  It really didn't add anything to the story.  I did like how the film tried to portray Don as a good person with a good heart who just happened to be weak by being addicted to drugs.  That was one of the strengths in the film: Ryan Gosling's portrayal of Don.  However, it would've been nice if there was a little bit more of a story in the film.  Having Don and Drey trying to help eachother in an unfortunate situation did not seem enough of a story.  That's probably why the dinner scene was included in the film--there wasn't anything else of importance to replace it with.

1036548,A3O8YT41TDXL0B,B000KX0IOK,"Rudy Palma ""The Writing Fiend""","[10, 11]","It may be named for an amateur wrestling move, but writer/director Ryan Fleck's ""Half Nelson"" drips with full-fledged cinematic sophistication from the first frame to the last. A story of two tormented lives inextricably intertwined by unlikely means, the tension it creates on screen is palpable and ever engrossing as it unfolds with increasing momentum.Best known for his role in the saccharine but well-received 2004 theatrical interpretation of Nicholas Sparks' novel ""The Notebook,"" Ryan Gosling lives his best day as an actor here. His portrayal of drug addict/history teacher Dan Dunn nabbed him his first Oscar nod, and his complete absorption of his character - everything from life-changing revelations to nervous ticks - justifies the accolades. With a fine script by Fleck and his collaborator Anna Boden in his hands, Gosling wrings it out for all its worth, seizing viewers in a way that only the best kind of actor can achieve.He quickly establishes Dunn as a good guy with a bad habit. An addict who spends many a night catching nary a wink of sleep, he still manages to be a consistent, scintillating presence for his junior high students in inner-city Brooklyn. Urging them to linger over history and consider it, not merely read and regurgitate, he provides an encouraging presence for the kids not just in the classroom but as a coach on the basketball court.He has a life full of important obligations, but his vices and dour circumstances - including an ex-girlfriend set to be married, played with understated verve by Tina Holmes, known for her work on ""Six Feet Under"" - keep steering him away from the right path. It nearly blows up in his face when tight-lipped student Drey, played endearingly by budding young actress Shareeka Epps, stumbles upon him stoned beyond mobility on the floor of the girls' bathroom. She is able to empathize with his unenviable situation, however, and grows particularly close to Dunn - especially considering their student/teacher relationship.With her mother, played brilliantly by frequent Fleck collaborator Karen Chilton, constantly at work to pay the bills, as well as an absent father, Drey is already grown up in many ways at her young age. Her brother is serving prison time for a botched drug deal, and Frank, played by Anthony Mackie, is to blame. Like a crafty car salesman, his charm is hard to resist yet hard, helping him succeeds in luring her back into his life despite the hardships he brought upon her family. His intentions seem innocent initially, as though he owes her a makeshift big brother after causing hers to vanish. Some things are too good to be true, however.The lives of Dunn and Drey soon overlap due to their intense, deep care for one another. Each has a host of problems, but both seem better equipped to fix each others' than their own. Frank drives a sharp wedge between the both of them, and sooner or later something has got to give.Everything falls into place in ""Half Nelson"" in a satisfying fashion. The script, the actors and the setting combine to make a whole different world for these characters to live and breathe in, even if it's one that looks familiar around the edges. A lot of films have promise, but this fulfills every one of them with magic to spare.",5,Gosling Impresses in Tale of Drugs and Deception,1176940800,"04 19, 2007",2007,3265,"['may', 'be', 'named', 'amateur', 'wrestling', 'move', 'writer/director', 'Ryan', 'Fleck', 'Half', 'Nelson', 'full-fledged', 'cinematic', 'sophistication', 'first', 'frame', 'last', 'story', 'two', 'tormented', 'lives', 'inextricably', 'intertwined', 'unlikely', 'means', 'tension', 'screen', 'palpable', 'ever', 'engrossing', 'increasing', 'momentum.Best', 'known', 'role', 'saccharine', 'well-received', '2004', 'theatrical', 'interpretation', 'Nicholas', 'Sparks', 'novel', 'Notebook', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'best', 'day', 'actor', 'here', 'portrayal', 'drug', 'addict/history', 'teacher', 'Dan', 'Dunn', 'nabbed', 'first', 'Oscar', 'nod', 'complete', 'absorption', 'character', 'everything', 'life-changing', 'revelations', 'nervous', 'ticks', 'accolades', 'fine', 'script', 'Fleck', 'collaborator', 'Anna', 'Boden', 'hands', 'Gosling', 'wrings', 'out', 'worth', 'seizing', 'viewers', 'way', 'only', 'best', 'kind', 'actor', 'can', 'achieve.He', 'quickly', 'establishes', 'Dunn', 'good', 'guy', 'bad', 'habit', 'addict', 'who', 'many', 'night', 'catching', 'wink', 'sleep', 'still', 'be', 'consistent', 'scintillating', 'presence', 'junior', 'high', 'students', 'inner-city', 'Brooklyn', 'Urging', 'linger', 'history', 'consider', 'not', 'merely', 'read', 'regurgitate', 'encouraging', 'presence', 'kids', 'not', 'just', 'classroom', 'coach', 'basketball', 'court.He', 'life', 'full', 'important', 'obligations', 'vices', 'dour', 'circumstances', 'including', 'ex-girlfriend', 'set', 'be', 'married', 'played', 'understated', 'verve', 'Tina', 'Holmes', 'known', 'work', 'Six', 'Feet', 'keep', 'steering', 'away', 'right', 'path', 'nearly', 'up', 'face', 'when', 'tight-lipped', 'student', 'Drey', 'played', 'endearingly', 'budding', 'young', 'actress', 'Shareeka', 'Epps', 'stoned', 'mobility', 'floor', 'girls', 'bathroom', 'able', 'empathize', 'unenviable', 'situation', 'however', 'particularly', 'close', 'Dunn', 'especially', 'considering', 'student/teacher', 'mother', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'frequent', 'Fleck', 'collaborator', 'Karen', 'Chilton', 'constantly', 'work', 'pay', 'bills', 'as', 'well', 'absent', 'father', 'Drey', 'already', 'grown', 'up', 'many', 'ways', 'young', 'age', 'brother', 'serving', 'prison', 'time', 'botched', 'drug', 'deal', 'Frank', 'played', 'Anthony', 'Mackie', 'blame', 'crafty', 'car', 'salesman', 'charm', 'hard', 'resist', 'yet', 'hard', 'helping', 'luring', 'back', 'life', 'hardships', 'brought', 'upon', 'family', 'intentions', 'seem', 'innocent', 'initially', 'makeshift', 'big', 'brother', 'causing', 'hers', 'vanish', 'things', 'are', 'too', 'good', 'be', 'true', 'however.The', 'lives', 'Dunn', 'Drey', 'soon', 'overlap', 'due', 'intense', 'deep', 'care', 'one', 'host', 'problems', 'seem', 'better', 'equipped', 'fix', 'others', 'own', 'Frank', 'sharp', 'wedge', 'sooner', 'later', 'something', 'got', 'give.Everything', 'falls', 'place', 'Half', 'Nelson', 'satisfying', 'fashion', 'script', 'actors', 'setting', 'combine', 'make', 'whole', 'different', 'world', 'characters', 'live', 'breathe', 'even', 'one', 'familiar', 'edges', 'lot', 'films', 'have', 'promise', 'one', 'magic', 'spare']",N/A

Relatively little violence. Moderate profanity, but nothing I've never heard before. So why was this movie so supremely offensive?Easy.

I was disturbed by this film's endorsement of all the worst elements of our ever-declining society.Ryan Gosling, who was inexplicably nominated for an Academy Award for this role, looks like a thinner David Arquette (but craps out in trying to out-act him).  His method of teaching a history class is rambling on about esoteric philosophies and never managing to put them in any historical context.

1036550,AZCDCO6KK2T81,B000KX0IOK,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[0, 2]","I agree with Amazon's review in that Ryan Gosling's Oscar-nominated performance finally has him living up to all the hype that has surrounded this talented actor who has chosen some questionable film roles.  Although I'm a teacher myself and one who grew up and attended schools in some very rough neighborhoods in Brooklyn, New York I do have trouble embracing this film because, to be honest, it is so difficult to watch.Watching a overall decent and caring teacher free-fall into the misery of addiction is hard.  In addition, watching a promising young student of his that looks up to him begin to fall as well when she learns of his addiction is even more painful.  Further, watching others take advantage of both of them just makes this film agony to watch at times.  All this is even harder to swallow as there is no satisfying ending to the film, but that is real life and I applaud the writer and director for not faultering and going with a ""happy ending"" where it didn't belong.  There is, however, a glimmer of hope for both characters at the very, but no promise of any kind of a bright future let alone any future.  It's scary and wholly believable.I recommend this film based on its realism, uncompromising plot, and acting power; however, this kind of film is not for everyone.

An independent film starring Ryan Gosling (""The Notebook"", ""Murder By Numbers""), released by a very small independent company, it will be difficult for most to find this film, but it is well worth the effort to search for it. I first heard of it while watching `Ebert & Roeper'; Roeper and his guest host, filmmaker Kevin Smith just couldn't stop raving about it. This is the best thing about `Ebert & Roeper'; they draw attention to worthy, small, independent films, giving them an audience they may never have received. Hopefully, I will be able to spread the word a little as well, and help this film find an audience.Dan Dunne (Gosling), a junior high history teacher at an inner city New York school, seems to be connecting with the majority of his students, teaching them about the history of their country, urging them to come up with ideas and not simply regurgitate facts and dates. He is also the coach of the losing basketball team, but holds out hope. Returning to his apartment, his drug habit calls and he smokes some crack. The drug habit relegates him to a life of squalor in a dumpy apartment, with creditors calling him on the phone. The drugs allow him to escape and give him an excuse to not connect with his friends, maintain relationships, or to work on his children's book. One night, after a basketball game, Dan steals away to the girl's bathroom for a fix and one of his students, Drey (Shareeka Epps) walks in and discovers him. He's in bad shape, so she helps him out and they soon begin to look out for each other, forming an unusual and different relationship. Drey is a self-sufficient young lady, living with her single mother, who frequently works double shifts as an ambulance driver. She goes to visit her brother in jail and visits Frank (Anthony Mackie), the local drug dealer, who is a friend of Drey's brother. Will they be able to help each other escape the life they are destined for?Written by Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden and directed by Fleck, ""Half Nelson"" is a remarkably believable film. The performances by Gosling and Epps are the key to the success of ""Half Nelson"", but the story, direction, everything else about the film is as memorable and believable.I have never been that impressed by Gosling in his previous work, but that was, apparently, all preparation for his great performance in this film. As Dunne, he subtly reveals things about his character throughout, each time, providing a new link to the overall portrait, a new piece of the puzzle. We learn early on that Dunne is a drug addict, but what is surprising is that he is still able to function in his job, and rather well, as a history teacher. He teaches these kids how to think and many of them are responding. Then, we watch as he courts another teacher, and this helps us to learn how he deals with his relationships, and it makes sense when he seems to blow off an old friend. We learn that he has a book project that has been stalled and this provides another explanation for his drug habit. Or shows another consequence. Everything in his life is in limbo or has been stalled because he is caught in this drug hazed state.When his student, Drey, finds him in the bathroom, he needs help. Because she is kind to him, he feels that he can trust her and they begin a friendship, looking out for each other, trying to help one another. This may seem theatrical, but it works because both performers are entirely natural. Dunne is a Caucasian who is teaching at an inner city school because he wants to make a change. Drey is an inner city kid, living with her single mom, dealing with all of the bad influences in her neighborhood, but she survives. Another thing that helps both of these performances is their subtlety. Each is reveled in layers, as the film progresses, allowing us to assimilate the information and make the characters seem real. If all of this information were pounded over our head in the first few minutes, it wouldn't work. It would smack of Big Studio Hollywood. Look at the great performance by Gosling! Oscar Bait. But because the film is independent, the filmmakers don't have to hit emotional cues at certain prescribed times, they can let the characters unfold more naturally, aiding the performances and making them real. In fact, Gosling might stand a better chance of getting an Oscar nomination because the film is produced and released by an independent company.Shareeka Epps is also quite good as Drey, the young girl who is a student of Dunne's. As the story is about their relationship, we spend a significant amount of time with her. The character is 12, going on 40, and Epps manages to portray her strong-willed nature while at the same time revealing Drey's vulnerabilities. Again, this performance has stereotype written all over it, but because the actor is allowed time with the character, we learn things about her gradually, and it makes her believable. We can understand why she would be drawn to her teacher, why she would befriend him in a way, look after him. But since she is just 12, and has influences of her own, she can't really change his life that much. She has too much to deal with on her own. Left unsupervised for much of the time, she learns how to be self-sufficient and look out for herself. She goes to visit her brother in jail, alone, when her mother is too busy at work. She visits Frank, collecting money from him, because her brother worked with Frank and may have protected him from incarceration. But because she has no one in her life, she starts to look at Dunne and Frank for support, friendship, companionship, and a male influence. As the relationship with both men grows, a tug of war develops between them. Is either man a better influence? Will they be able to guide her in a significant way?As I describe each of these elements, I keep thinking about how `television movie of the week' it sounds. An inner city girl living in a home with her single mom, left to her own devices. A young Caucasian man who teaches at the junior high and becomes a drug addict. Just reading it on paper almost makes my stomach churn. But this is yet another reason to see the film. The filmmakers have created a believable, interesting portrait of these two main characters and all of their influences and problems. The key to the film is that everything is revealed in stages, slowly, allowing us to assimilate before learning something new. Everything is a piece of the puzzle and we learn of certain pieces at certain times. It isn't a linear progression, making it seem more like we are watching real people go about their lives.As Dunne sinks further into his problem, trying to maintain a normal existence, we witness as he comes apart at the seams. Gosling deserves a lot of credit for making this work. As he starts to unravel, becoming less aware in his class, more tired, more affected by the drug use, everything is subtle. Yet, he still manages to function. He is able to lecture his class, to teach them, stopping only when his nose starts to bleed. Entering the teacher's lounge, he states ""I can't handle this anymore"" and a fellow teacher mistakes the statement for a general comment about working with kids.Another element working in the film's favor is the ambiguous ending. As each character has reached a new low, they seem to realize they can help each other, a realization they have been working towards for some time. But will they be able to help each other? We don't know because the film ends before the story does. This helps to maintain the realism of the story and their problems; each is in a place that will take a lot of time to work out of, so it would seem unnatural to have a happy, sappy resolution tying everything up in the last few minutes.""Half Nelson"" is a film that will be difficult to find, but it deserves the effort and your attention.

It's a very strong movie and captivating in it's own way, because it focuses on character and performances more than plotline. At times, it's feels kind of documentary-like.

I think it's certainly a good movie in a way that it's very educational and inspirational to the audiences who have been in those two characters' shoes. This film has it's shocking moments such as the one when Epps became involved and witnessed the drug afflicted party scene in a motel room, and that she was even developing an attraction to her teacher(Gosling). So yes, it was entirely convincing that Gosling's performance in this film was worthy of his Oscar nomination, and IMO he's the best Canadian actor of his generation!",4,A heavy-duty character  and performance driven movie showcasing the best of Ryan Gosling.,1179964800,"05 24, 2007",2007,1319,"['Half', 'Nelson', 'not', 'most', 'original', 'movie', 'kind', 'dealing', 'drugs', 'intergenerational/inter-racial', 'friendship', 'spiritual', 'redemption/recovery', 'very', 'strong', 'movie', 'captivating', 'own', 'way', 'character', 'more', 'plotline', 'times', 'feels', 'kind', 'documentary-like', 'must', 'say', 'also', 'heartbreaking', 'moments', 'scenes', 'when', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'teacher', 'character', 'abusing', 'crack', 'school', 'women', 'washroom', 'being', 'rescued', 'Shareeka', 'Epps', 'student', 'when', 'was', 'verge', 'overdosing', 'performances', 'Gosling', 'Epps', 'were', 'so', 'real', 'memsmerizing', 'Gosling', 'very', 'convincing', 'overall', 'portrayal', 'school', 'teacher', 'trying', 'hide', 'addiction', 'struggling', 'quit', 'same', 'time', 'think', 'certainly', 'good', 'movie', 'way', 'very', 'educational', 'inspirational', 'audiences', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'two', 'characters', 'shoes', 'film', 'shocking', 'moments', 'such', 'one', 'when', 'Epps', 'became', 'involved', 'witnessed', 'drug', 'afflicted', 'party', 'scene', 'motel', 'room', 'was', 'even', 'developing', 'attraction', 'teacher', 'Gosling', 'So', 'yes', 'was', 'entirely', 'convincing', 'Gosling', 'performance', 'film', 'was', 'worthy', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'IMO', 'best', 'Canadian', 'actor', 'generation']",N/A
1036558,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B000KX0IOK,Wuchak,"[2, 4]","""Half Nelson"" is a 2006 independent film starring Ryan Gosling as Mr. Dunne, a white school teacher in an inner-city Brooklyn middle school. Mr. Dunne has noble ambitions of being a positive force in the lives of his students but he's bogged down by a crack habit. He strikes up a much-needed friendship with one of his students, a latchkey 13 year-old black girl named Drey, who accidently discovers his drug problem.Richard Roeper and Kevin Smith's review on At The Movies called ""Half Nelson"" a masterpiece that everyone should seek out, view and relish; unfortunately it's not even close to being that good.Yes, the acting is great across the board, especially Gosling, but acting itself does not a movie make. What's wrong with this film? For one thing, the story plays out in a dreary monotone its entire length (106 minutes) and ends on an unresolved note. Yet, even this doesn't explain why the film fails to be truly good or great; after all, 2004's ""The Woodsman"" also plays out in a flat, realistic manner and ends somewhat unresolved, but that film is great. So where does ""Half Nelson"" go wrong?Although Ryan Gosling is an excellent actor, his character in this film, Mr. Dunne, is lifeless, unlikable, hypocritical and unrepentant; by contrast, Keven Bacon in ""The Woodsman"" may be lifeless and unlikable, but at least he wasn't hypocritical or unrepentant.By ""lifeless and unlikable"" I mean that he lacks vibrancy and inspiration, even when he's in his glory teaching his kids about dialectics & history. There's simply no charisma that would compel anyone to want to seek him out, learn from him or befriend him, like, say, Robin Williams' character in ""Dead Poets Society.""By ""hypocritical"" I mean the obvious: How much of a positive impact could he possibly have on inner-city youths if he himself is addticted to drugs? This brings to mind the absurd scene where Mr. Dunne confronts a drug dealer who's using Drey as a drug deliverer. Dunne doesn't want Drey to be negatively influenced by a drug dealer but it's okay for her to hang out with a pathetic drug addict like himself (?). The scene ends with Dunne having a drink and ""candy"" with the drug dealer -- lot of good that confrontation did.By ""unrepentant"" I mean there's no indication in the story that Dunne desires to or will ultimately choose to detox from his drug habit. He makes the statement that ""rehab doesn't work."" Okay, that's fine, but do SOMETHING to try to escape your drug problem!There are other problems with the film:- The camera bobbles around too much as if to draw attention to itself (""See, this is a realistic slice-of-life picture!"") It smacks of pretension.- The kids in the classroom seem too well-behaved. This is a problem in Anywhere, America, let alone the inner-city.- Despite Mr. Dunne's monotone dreariness, the viewer does desire to see him escape his addiction and fulfill his noble ambitions. We also come to care about Drey -- will she acquire the wisdom to stay away from drugs (dealing or addiction) and prison or will she too become part of the problem? Unfortunately the film leaves everything up in the air. We don't even know if Dunne still has his job at the end.I get the points the film is trying to make -- this is an anti-inspirational teacher/mentor movie. There's no by-the-numbers breakthrough for student or teacher. ""Half Nelson"" isn't concerned with such things; it's concerned with the the simple achievement of going to work every day and accomplishing something beyond oneself, despite a flawed nature and crippling habit. It's a fine point but it could have been done in a much more compelling way.Don't get me wrong, I don't hate ""Half Nelson."" I did appreciate quite a few aspects of it, especially Dunne's unlikely friendship with a 13 year-old girl, but the story never rises above its flat dreariness to become anything more than okay.",3,"Okay, but overrated",1253750400,"09 24, 2009",2009,3875,"['Nelson', '2006', 'independent', 'film', 'starring', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'Mr.', 'Dunne', 'white', 'school', 'teacher', 'inner-city', 'Brooklyn', 'middle', 'school', 'Mr.', 'Dunne', 'noble', 'ambitions', 'being', 'positive', 'force', 'lives', 'students', 'bogged', 'down', 'crack', 'habit', 'up', 'much-needed', 'friendship', 'one', 'students', 'latchkey', '13', 'year-old', 'black', 'girl', 'named', 'Drey', 'who', 'accidently', 'drug', 'problem.Richard', 'Roeper', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'review', 'Movies', 'called', 'Half', 'Nelson', 'masterpiece', 'everyone', 'should', 'seek', 'out', 'view', 'relish', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'even', 'close', 'being', 'good.Yes', 'acting', 'great', 'board', 'especially', 'Gosling', 'acting', 'not', 'movie', 'make', 'What', 'wrong', 'film', 'one', 'thing', 'story', 'out', 'dreary', 'monotone', 'entire', 'length', '106', 'minutes', 'unresolved', 'note', 'even', ""n't"", 'explain', 'why', 'film', 'be', 'truly', 'good', 'great', '2004', 'Woodsman', 'also', 'out', 'flat', 'realistic', 'manner', 'somewhat', 'unresolved', 'film', 'great', 'So', 'where', 'Half', 'Nelson', 'go', 'wrong', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'excellent', 'actor', 'character', 'film', 'Mr.', 'Dunne', 'lifeless', 'unlikable', 'hypocritical', 'unrepentant', 'contrast', 'Keven', 'Bacon', 'Woodsman', 'may', 'be', 'lifeless', 'unlikable', 'least', 'was', ""n't"", 'hypocritical', 'unrepentant.By', 'lifeless', 'unlikable', 'mean', 'vibrancy', 'inspiration', 'even', 'when', 'glory', 'teaching', 'kids', 'dialectics', 'history', 'simply', 'charisma', 'would', 'compel', 'anyone', 'want', 'seek', 'out', 'learn', 'befriend', 'say', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'character', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'Society', 'hypocritical', 'mean', 'obvious', 'How', 'much', 'positive', 'impact', 'could', 'possibly', 'have', 'inner-city', 'youths', 'addticted', 'drugs', 'mind', 'absurd', 'scene', 'where', 'Mr.', 'Dunne', 'drug', 'dealer', 'who', 'using', 'Drey', 'drug', 'deliverer', 'Dunne', ""n't"", 'want', 'Drey', 'be', 'negatively', 'influenced', 'drug', 'dealer', 'okay', 'hang', 'out', 'pathetic', 'drug', 'addict', 'scene', 'Dunne', 'having', 'drink', 'candy', 'drug', 'dealer', 'lot', 'good', 'confrontation', 'did.By', 'unrepentant', 'mean', 'indication', 'story', 'Dunne', 'will', 'ultimately', 'choose', 'detox', 'drug', 'habit', 'statement', 'rehab', ""n't"", 'work', 'Okay', 'fine', 'do', 'SOMETHING', 'try', 'escape', 'drug', 'problem', 'are', 'other', 'problems', 'film', 'camera', 'around', 'too', 'much', 'draw', 'attention', 'See', 'realistic', 'slice-of-life', 'picture', 'pretension.-', 'kids', 'classroom', 'seem', 'too', 'well-behaved', 'problem', 'Anywhere', 'America', 'let', 'alone', 'inner-city.-', 'Mr.', 'Dunne', 'monotone', 'dreariness', 'viewer', 'desire', 'see', 'escape', 'addiction', 'fulfill', 'noble', 'ambitions', 'also', 'come', 'care', 'Drey', 'will', 'acquire', 'wisdom', 'stay', 'away', 'drugs', 'dealing', 'addiction', 'prison', 'will', 'too', 'become', 'part', 'problem', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'everything', 'up', 'air', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'Dunne', 'still', 'job', 'end.I', 'get', 'points', 'film', 'trying', 'make', 'anti-inspirational', 'teacher/mentor', 'movie', 'by-the-numbers', 'student', 'teacher', 'Half', 'Nelson', ""n't"", 'concerned', 'such', 'things', 'concerned', 'simple', 'achievement', 'going', 'work', 'day', 'accomplishing', 'something', 'flawed', 'nature', 'crippling', 'habit', 'fine', 'point', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'much', 'more', 'compelling', 'way.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'do', ""n't"", 'hate', 'Half', 'Nelson', 'did', 'appreciate', 'quite', 'few', 'aspects', 'especially', 'Dunne', 'unlikely', 'friendship', '13', 'year-old', 'girl', 'story', 'never', 'flat', 'dreariness', 'become', 'anything', 'more', 'okay']",N/A

1036560,A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ,B000KX0IOK,"Z. Freeman ""Zach""","[10, 13]","First of all, Half Nelson is everything an independent film should be. There's no cut-and-dry plot with a good guy vs. bad guy, beginning, middle, end, etc. What Half Nelson offers is a cinematic slice of realistic life. The realistic life the script is most concerned with is Dan Dunne, a junior high teacher in Brooklyn with a little bit of a drug problem.Ryan Gosling excellently portrays the troubled teacher and earns his Oscar nomination without a doubt. Dan Dunne wants to change the world. He wants to help people. But more and more he's realizing that he is just one man, and the world is weighing heavily on his shoulders. That's where the drug use comes in. And the trips to bars looking for conversation partners just leave him more depressed.The other central character in the film is a young girl named Drey in one of Dan's classes, played by Shareeka Epps. Epps brings enough to her character to carry her scenes and even keep up with Gosling in all their scenes together. (She earned a Best Young Actress nomination but Abigail Breslin from Little Miss Sunshine won).Overall, the film addresses a lot of important issues: drug addiction, loneliness, self-reliance, and dialectics (the tension between two opposing forces). There are several intercut scenes of students giving reports on important dates in the history of the United States, mostly Civil Rights movement events. These are used to demonstrate that enough people can make a difference.Ultimately, Dunne understands that he can't help everyone in the world, but he can help one person, namely Drey. What keeps the movie from being another ""Dangerous Minds""-esque film is Dunne's own inner turmoil, and the opposing character played by Anthony Mackie, who is also trying to ""help"" Drey by getting her to deal drugs with him. He's not portrayed as a bad guy, just a guy doing what he knows how to do.The realism in the construction of this script and filmwork is what really sets this film apart, and Ryan Gosling's acting just seals the deal. If you want to see a best actor nominee from this year that is really in a good movie, check out Half Nelson.",4,Best movie overall out of the Best Actor category,1171497600,"02 15, 2007",2007,2129,"['First', 'all', 'Half', 'Nelson', 'everything', 'independent', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'cut-and-dry', 'plot', 'good', 'guy', 'vs.', 'bad', 'guy', 'beginning', 'middle', 'end', 'etc', 'What', 'Half', 'Nelson', 'cinematic', 'slice', 'realistic', 'life', 'realistic', 'life', 'script', 'most', 'concerned', 'Dan', 'Dunne', 'junior', 'high', 'teacher', 'Brooklyn', 'little', 'bit', 'drug', 'problem.Ryan', 'Gosling', 'excellently', 'troubled', 'teacher', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'doubt', 'Dan', 'Dunne', 'change', 'world', 'help', 'people', 'more', 'more', 'realizing', 'just', 'one', 'man', 'world', 'weighing', 'heavily', 'shoulders', 'where', 'drug', 'use', 'trips', 'bars', 'looking', 'conversation', 'partners', 'just', 'leave', 'more', 'depressed.The', 'other', 'central', 'character', 'film', 'young', 'girl', 'named', 'Drey', 'one', 'Dan', 'classes', 'played', 'Shareeka', 'Epps', 'Epps', 'enough', 'character', 'carry', 'scenes', 'even', 'keep', 'up', 'Gosling', 'scenes', 'together', 'earned', 'Best', 'Young', 'Actress', 'nomination', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'won', '.Overall', 'film', 'lot', 'important', 'issues', 'drug', 'addiction', 'loneliness', 'self-reliance', 'dialectics', 'tension', 'two', 'opposing', 'forces', 'are', 'several', 'intercut', 'scenes', 'students', 'giving', 'reports', 'important', 'dates', 'history', 'United', 'States', 'mostly', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'movement', 'events', 'are', 'used', 'demonstrate', 'enough', 'people', 'can', 'make', 'difference.Ultimately', 'Dunne', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'everyone', 'world', 'can', 'help', 'one', 'person', 'namely', 'Drey', 'What', 'movie', 'being', 'Dangerous', 'Minds', '-esque', 'film', 'Dunne', 'own', 'inner', 'turmoil', 'opposing', 'character', 'played', 'Anthony', 'Mackie', 'who', 'also', 'trying', 'help', 'Drey', 'getting', 'deal', 'drugs', 'not', 'portrayed', 'bad', 'guy', 'just', 'guy', 'doing', 'what', 'how', 'do.The', 'realism', 'construction', 'script', 'filmwork', 'what', 'really', 'film', 'apart', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'acting', 'just', 'deal', 'want', 'see', 'best', 'actor', 'nominee', 'year', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'check', 'out', 'Half', 'Nelson']",N/A
