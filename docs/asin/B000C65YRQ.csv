955206,AIMR915K4YCN,B000C65YRQ,"Bindy Sue Frnknschtein ""bigfootsalienbaby""","[10, 10]","I bought this double feature for PARENTS, but thoroughly enjoyed FEAR as well. I love Ally Sheedy (Man's Best Friend) enough to watch her in just about anything! Her role as Cayce Bridges, well-known psychic and author, was a real treat. She has made a career out of using her mental powers to assist police departments in tracking down assailents and (hopefully) rescuing victims. The idea of a psychic helping the police catch criminals is nothing new, but having a serial killer use his own psychic abilities to torment Cayce is definitely different! The interaction between Cayce and the ""Shadow Man"" is tense and frightening, especially when he decides to go after Cayce for real, instead of just playing twisted games with her. No one is safe! PARENTS is a tremendously wicked, jet-black comedy set in 1950s suburbia. Randy Quaid (Independence Day) and Mary Beth Hurt are the Laemles. They move to a new town w/ their 10yo son, Michael. Dad works at TOXICO, where he works on chemical defoliating agents. Mom is a perfectly prim housewife, always working in the kitchen on new and exciting meat recipes. Michael has a hard time at home, due to his suspicions about dear mom and dad. What does dad REALLY do all day at work? What KIND of meat is mom preparing? Michael also has trouble at his new school, where he draws macabre pictures and says some very disturbing things to his teacher, Miss Baxter. This causes the chain-smoking, school social-worker (played wonderfully by Sandy Dennis) to get involved. The darkness and dread  in PARENTS are perfectly in synch with the bleakest black humor I've seen since Dr. Strangelove! Bizarre, unsettling, and dreadfully funny, this movie is worth multiple viewings. I highly recommend this double bill...  P.S.- Yep, both movies are in widescreen, even though the box says full screen!

955207,A3E1UIGSVRQXQ,B000C65YRQ,"Bobby Brady ""Radioman970""","[0, 0]","FEAR has a TV movie feel but it's actually somewhat above your average b-movie and Sheedy does a pretty good job with the material.  The antagonist and the storyline could have used a little more pep, but then it probably would have been even more like every other psycho-thriller.  It has some unique, if unlikely, aspects that pull me out of the movie a little.  Not that I totally discredit psychics, but the writer of this takes it to a new level that really could use something to give it a little more believability.  Still, this film has some tension at times.  Not worth the price of the set for it alone, however.  Now, same can't be said for PARENTS.  Truly, I bought this set for it alone and I was not disappointed.  I rented PARENTS when it first hit the video store and was blown away.  It made me seek out more black comedies.  It's really first rate and I was happy to find out it did hold up over the years.  The cast is great, the production design and storyline is terrific.  And as everyone has already stated, this film is in widesreen and looks mighty sweet.  NO COMPLAINTS.  I can't give this set 5 stars because I think FEAR is not worthy.  BUt if you can find this cheaper than the stated price, maybe $10 or so, then you're taking about a 5 star purchase.",4,Excellent value for PARENTS alone....,1237075200,"03 15, 2009",2009,1281,"['FEAR', 'TV', 'movie', 'feel', 'actually', 'somewhat', 'average', 'b-movie', 'Sheedy', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'material', 'antagonist', 'storyline', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'little', 'more', 'pep', 'then', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'more', 'other', 'psycho-thriller', 'unique', 'unlikely', 'pull', 'movie', 'little', 'Not', 'totally', 'discredit', 'psychics', 'writer', 'new', 'level', 'really', 'could', 'use', 'something', 'give', 'little', 'more', 'believability', 'Still', 'film', 'tension', 'times', 'Not', 'price', 'set', 'alone', 'however', 'Now', 'same', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'said', 'PARENTS', 'Truly', 'bought', 'set', 'alone', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'rented', 'PARENTS', 'when', 'first', 'hit', 'video', 'store', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'made', 'seek', 'out', 'more', 'black', 'comedies', 'really', 'first', 'rate', 'was', 'happy', 'find', 'out', 'did', 'hold', 'up', 'years', 'cast', 'great', 'production', 'design', 'storyline', 'terrific', 'everyone', 'already', 'stated', 'film', 'widesreen', 'mighty', 'sweet', 'COMPLAINTS', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'set', '5', 'stars', 'think', 'FEAR', 'not', 'worthy', 'BUt', 'can', 'find', 'cheaper', 'stated', 'price', 'maybe', '10', 'so', 'then', ""'re"", 'taking', '5', 'star', 'purchase']",Fear / Parents

I seen the film on television in 1996, and was totally creeped out by the psychic elements.  For years I thought this film was called ""Fear Me"", but I couldn't find it anywhere.  I decided to get on IMDB & look at Ally Sheedy's filmography & found that it was just called ""FEAR"".  I ordered the film right away & love it even more now than I did back in 1996.
