It's not a Disney portrayal of a boy and his dog, but rather a more realistic telling of the fate of racing greyhounds. If you are a big Gillian Anderson fan, be aware that she has a supporting role here as the protagonist's mother, and so her screentime is limited. Also, beware of the lack of close captioning and the sick Irish accent and slang that is the language of this film.",3,not your typical dramedy,1248048000,"07 20, 2009",2009,460,"['movie', 'story', 'little', 'boy', 'trying', 'save', 'life', 'one', 'dog', 'not', 'Disney', 'portrayal', 'boy', 'dog', 'rather', 'more', 'realistic', 'telling', 'fate', 'racing', 'greyhounds', 'are', 'big', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'fan', 'be', 'aware', 'supporting', 'role', 'here', 'protagonist', 'mother', 'so', 'screentime', 'limited', 'Also', 'beware', 'lack', 'close', 'captioning', 'sick', 'Irish', 'accent', 'slang', 'language', 'film']","Mighty Celt, The"

I'd say that it depicts life in Donal's part of Ireland so realistically that one could think they were watching filmed every-day life there.  By this, I mean that there are very few typical film tricks to evoke emotion or to carry the story.  The only one I noticed was at the end when the animal control people were confiscating the dogs from the evil trainer.  There are actually two stories here; one is Donal's relationship with the dog trainer, and the other is with the man who comes into his life, one who carries a long-held secret.  Both stories are interwoven seamlessly into a very satisfying whole.I do have a couple of caveats, however.  The first is that young Donal, about 13 or 14 years old, is shown smoking over and over again.  Even when the stranger says it is bad for him, Donal defends it.  I don't recall any bad language, once again proving that evil people and 'low class' people can be shown realistically in movies without constant swearing.  The second warning to families with young children is that some dogs are being shown (apparently) drowned in a quarry, and the dog trainer slashes the throat of Donal's assigned dog, one that he trained for racing.Both my wife and I found this movie to be very realistic and it certainly did not lag in any way.  I would give it five stars if it weren't for the smoking by a young teen boy.  Also, it is graded down a bit because there is not closed captioning, and we simply could not figure out what some (especially the dog trainer) were saying because it the strong Irish dialect of English.  All in all, it is an excellent movie about a boy, a dog, and of both betrayal and creating new family ties.",4,"Excellent Movie, but with Parental Guidance Needed",1233792000,"02 5, 2009",2009,1730,"['Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Disney', 'style', 'cute', 'story', 'movie', ""'d"", 'say', 'life', 'Donal', 'part', 'Ireland', 'so', 'realistically', 'one', 'could', 'think', 'were', 'watching', 'filmed', 'every-day', 'life', 'there', 'mean', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'typical', 'film', 'tricks', 'evoke', 'emotion', 'carry', 'story', 'only', 'one', 'noticed', 'was', 'end', 'when', 'animal', 'control', 'people', 'were', 'confiscating', 'dogs', 'evil', 'trainer', 'are', 'actually', 'two', 'stories', 'here', 'one', 'Donal', 'relationship', 'dog', 'trainer', 'other', 'man', 'who', 'life', 'one', 'who', 'long-held', 'secret', 'stories', 'are', 'interwoven', 'seamlessly', 'very', 'satisfying', 'whole.I', 'do', 'have', 'couple', 'caveats', 'however', 'first', 'young', 'Donal', 'about', '13', '14', 'years', 'old', 'shown', 'smoking', 'over', 'again', 'Even', 'when', 'stranger', 'bad', 'Donal', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'bad', 'language', 'once', 'again', 'proving', 'evil', 'people', ""'low"", 'class', 'people', 'can', 'be', 'shown', 'realistically', 'movies', 'constant', 'swearing', 'second', 'warning', 'families', 'young', 'children', 'dogs', 'are', 'being', 'shown', 'apparently', 'drowned', 'quarry', 'dog', 'trainer', 'throat', 'Donal', 'assigned', 'dog', 'one', 'trained', 'wife', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'very', 'realistic', 'certainly', 'did', 'not', 'lag', 'way', 'would', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'were', ""n't"", 'smoking', 'young', 'teen', 'boy', 'Also', 'graded', 'down', 'bit', 'not', 'closed', 'captioning', 'simply', 'could', 'not', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'especially', 'dog', 'trainer', 'were', 'saying', 'strong', 'Irish', 'dialect', 'English', 'excellent', 'movie', 'boy', 'dog', 'betrayal', 'creating', 'new', 'family', 'ties']","Mighty Celt, The"

But I've watched it over and over again because I truly love it. Somehow, Mr. Carlyle is at his best when he's defending a child, and that's certainly true here. His &#34;dad&#34; instincts come through loud and clear, and he just makes me want to cry sometimes with his fearless ability to show vulnerability and love. Gillian Anderson is wonderful as the crusty mom with all her walls up, and her young son is just....wow. Beware that there is a scene of extreme animal cruelty, so if that's going to put you off, be careful. But that's only one small scene, and it sets up what follows, so grit your teeth, animal lovers, and get over yourselves. I also loved the accents here - whether Mr. Carlyle is doing a movie set in Sheffield, or Scotland, or Ireland, or Maine, or Fairy Tale Land, or Outer Space, he manages to sound authentic.

1161795,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00197YZCW,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 7]","The Mighty Celt (Pearse Elliott, 2005)Not a bad little film, this. When I read the description, I figured I was in for a Disney-esque light-hearted family tale about a dog winning against all odds, but that's certainly not what I got. It also listed the top stars as Tyrone McKenna and Ken Stott, so I was quite surprised when Gillian Anderson and Robert Carlyle popped up, as well. Surprises in casting are usually a good thing.Yes, there's a dog, and there's racing, and all that sort of thing, but a lighthearted family tale this is not. Good Joe (Stott, who's been making a name for himself recently as the title character in Rebus) runs a kennel for racing greyhounds. The tone of the movie is set in the opening scene, when we see him at a quarry tossing in a vaguely bloody and dog-shaped burlap sack. This is not a Disney film, by any means. Donal (McKenna, in his first screen role) is Joe's helper around the stables, and he gets attached to one of the dogs, whom he names The Mighty Celt. The dog trains well in the mornings, but in his first race, he finishes dead last. Donal saves the dog from disaster by making a deal with Joe: he'll train the dog and run him in his (Donal's) own name, and after three races, if the dog's become a winner, Joe will let Donal keep the dog. Cue miracle. Of course, that's not all; it seems any movie made in Ireland in the past thirty years must have a subplot regarding the Troubles (as any movie in America since 25th Hour must say something about 9/11), and that comes with the friction between Good Joe and Donal's uncle O (Carlyle, in a rare impressive performance), the latter of whom is tentatively romancing his ex-girlfriend and brother's widow, Kate (Anderson, in a not-at-all-rare impressive performance).It's not a great film, by any means-- the IRA plot sort of wanders off into the distance, never to be seen again, for one thing-- but it's emotionally honest, which is one thing that vast numbers of American movies involving children and their attachments to animals are not. That alone makes it worthy viewing for an American audience that's been weaned on such pap as The Incredible Journey and My Friend Flicka. McKenna does a creditable enough job with the role, and the actors around him are quite good; the script's few problems are jarring, but not a deal-killer. ***",3,Likable.,1212105600,"05 30, 2008",2008,2338,"['Mighty', 'Celt', 'Pearse', 'Elliott', '2005', 'Not', 'bad', 'little', 'film', 'When', 'read', 'description', 'figured', 'was', 'Disney-esque', 'light-hearted', 'family', 'tale', 'dog', 'winning', 'odds', 'certainly', 'not', 'what', 'got', 'also', 'listed', 'top', 'stars', 'Tyrone', 'McKenna', 'Ken', 'Stott', 'was', 'quite', 'surprised', 'when', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'Robert', 'Carlyle', 'popped', 'up', 'well', 'Surprises', 'casting', 'are', 'usually', 'good', 'thing.Yes', 'dog', 'racing', 'sort', 'thing', 'lighthearted', 'family', 'tale', 'not', 'Good', 'Joe', 'Stott', 'who', 'been', 'making', 'name', 'recently', 'title', 'character', 'Rebus', 'kennel', 'racing', 'greyhounds', 'tone', 'movie', 'set', 'opening', 'scene', 'when', 'see', 'quarry', 'tossing', 'vaguely', 'bloody', 'dog-shaped', 'burlap', 'sack', 'not', 'Disney', 'film', 'means', 'Donal', 'McKenna', 'first', 'screen', 'role', 'Joe', 'helper', 'stables', 'attached', 'one', 'dogs', 'whom', 'Mighty', 'Celt', 'dog', 'trains', 'well', 'mornings', 'first', 'race', 'dead', 'last', 'Donal', 'dog', 'disaster', 'making', 'deal', 'Joe', ""'ll"", 'train', 'dog', 'run', 'Donal', 'own', 'name', 'three', 'races', 'dog', 'become', 'winner', 'Joe', 'will', 'let', 'Donal', 'keep', 'dog', 'Cue', 'miracle', 'course', 'not', 'movie', 'made', 'Ireland', 'past', 'thirty', 'years', 'must', 'have', 'subplot', 'regarding', 'Troubles', 'movie', 'America', '25th', 'Hour', 'must', 'say', 'something', '9/11', 'friction', 'Good', 'Joe', 'Donal', 'uncle', 'O', 'Carlyle', 'rare', 'impressive', 'performance', 'latter', 'whom', 'tentatively', 'romancing', 'ex-girlfriend', 'brother', 'widow', 'Kate', 'Anderson', 'not-at-all-rare', 'impressive', 'performance', '.It', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'means', 'IRA', 'plot', 'sort', 'wanders', 'distance', 'never', 'be', 'seen', 'again', 'one', 'thing', 'emotionally', 'honest', 'one', 'thing', 'vast', 'numbers', 'American', 'movies', 'involving', 'children', 'attachments', 'animals', 'are', 'not', 'alone', 'worthy', 'viewing', 'American', 'audience', 'been', 'weaned', 'such', 'pap', 'Incredible', 'Journey', 'My', 'Friend', 'Flicka', 'McKenna', 'creditable', 'enough', 'job', 'role', 'actors', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'script', 'few', 'problems', 'are', 'jarring', 'not', 'deal-killer', '***']","Mighty Celt, The"
