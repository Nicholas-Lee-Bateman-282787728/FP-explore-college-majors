The town of Bedrock looks great and it looks like it does in the cartoalso good playing the role ofon show.John Goodman was an excellent choice for the role of Fred. Rick Morranis is also does a good job portraing the role of Barney. The rest of the cast is also good.You also see Halley Berry have small role in the film. The sequel is not that great because the sequel is a prequel. I am not a big fan of prequels and not a fan of this one either. There is not alot of star power in this film.The kid will enjoy more than the adults. But it is kind of interesting to see how Fred and Willma first met and how they get their pet Dino.

John Goodman portrays the noble Fred, but Rosie is everything you would want her to be.  Glamorous, witty, sexy, charming, and above all, realistic in her portrayal of a cartoon cavewoman.  It's easy to see how the fiesty Rosie wound up on ""The Veiw"".This inspired portrayal of the sensitive Betty Rubble, should have at least won an Academy Award nomination.
