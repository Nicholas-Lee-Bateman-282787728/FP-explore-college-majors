964539,A2BEU7GPGNIG44,B000E0OE62,Dorrie Wheeler,"[1, 1]","""Blood of a Champion"" is a very captivating film.  As always, Bokeem Woodbine is right on time.  He stars in the film as Shadow.  Shadow has served 10 years in prison and finds himself thrust back in society. He's not alone, Deborah Cox stars in the film as his waiting wife Sharon.  Sharon who was just finishing school up while Shadow was behind bars, has climbed the marketing/advertising corprate ladder.  Of course when he gets released from prison things aren't the same.  He claims she is different and Shadow warns her that he is definitly not the man he was before prison.  It is revealed that they married behind bars, so they are man and wife--with no children.Sharon gets Shadow a job in the mailroom at her powerful company and she also puts him in awkward situations like business dinners with her mostly white co-workers.  Shadow feels like a fish out of water and just doesn't fit in until he meets a guy who works at the company who tells him about an illegal underground fighting club.  Awe man, the fight scenes are off the hook, especially the scenario ""Suicide Sam,"" Shadow gets too deep into the well paying syndicate and gets in over his head.  Initially, he keeps his new lifestyle a secret from Sharon as they clash often, but she soon comes to seemingly support his decision.  Simply put ""Blood of Champions"" is one of the best films I have ever seen.  There are so many dramatic twists and turns in this film, and yes it's a tear jerker.  RZA did the original music for the soundtrack but there are also a lot of popular songs in the film including songs by Prince, Jay-z and other top music stars.  This movie is mad hot. I don't want to give away too much but the film is very enjoyable and thought provoking.",4,One of the Best Urban Films Ever,1141430400,"03 4, 2006",2006,1738,"['Blood', 'Champion', 'very', 'captivating', 'film', 'always', 'Bokeem', 'Woodbine', 'right', 'time', 'film', 'Shadow', 'Shadow', 'served', '10', 'years', 'prison', 'thrust', 'back', 'society', 'not', 'alone', 'Deborah', 'Cox', 'stars', 'film', 'waiting', 'wife', 'Sharon', 'Sharon', 'who', 'was', 'just', 'finishing', 'school', 'up', 'Shadow', 'was', 'bars', 'climbed', 'marketing/advertising', 'corprate', 'ladder', 'course', 'when', 'released', 'prison', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'same', 'different', 'Shadow', 'definitly', 'not', 'man', 'was', 'prison', 'revealed', 'married', 'bars', 'are', 'man', 'wife', 'children.Sharon', 'Shadow', 'job', 'mailroom', 'powerful', 'company', 'also', 'awkward', 'situations', 'business', 'dinners', 'mostly', 'white', 'co-workers', 'Shadow', 'feels', 'fish', 'water', 'just', ""n't"", 'fit', 'guy', 'who', 'company', 'who', 'illegal', 'underground', 'fighting', 'club', 'Awe', 'man', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'hook', 'especially', 'scenario', 'Suicide', 'Sam', 'Shadow', 'too', 'deep', 'well', 'paying', 'syndicate', 'head', 'Initially', 'new', 'lifestyle', 'secret', 'Sharon', 'clash', 'often', 'soon', 'seemingly', 'support', 'decision', 'Simply', 'put', 'Blood', 'Champions', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'dramatic', 'twists', 'film', 'tear', 'jerker', 'RZA', 'did', 'original', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'are', 'also', 'lot', 'popular', 'songs', 'film', 'including', 'songs', 'Prince', 'Jay-z', 'other', 'top', 'music', 'stars', 'movie', 'mad', 'hot', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'film', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'thought', 'provoking']",Blood of a Champion
