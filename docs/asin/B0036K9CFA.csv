1328146,A2582KMXLK2P06,B0036K9CFA,B. E Jackson,"[1, 1]","Jack & The Beanstalk is really really *strange*.  I think that's supposed to be the point so perhaps I'm just surprised how accurate the fairytale aspect turned out to be.  Yes, a child climbs a beanstalk, but the way the storyline develops -and especially the outrageous characters he meets along the way- is really... unique.  ""Unique"" is the best way to describe it.What's especially strange is the very beginning- Jack is a small boy who apparently grows up in a very secluded town with beautiful land and beautiful houses.  The people however, are FAR from beautiful (I didn't even REALIZE that was Christopher Lloyd playing the character of a school teacher with those wrinkles in his face, haha).  His facial expressions are awesome like always though, but I'm surprised he played the role of a strict teacher with high expectations out of his students.The main reason I dropped the rating one point is because there's this goose character played by Gilbert Gottfried, and we do NOT need an abundance of him OR that screechy high-pitched voice of his, haha.  All you parents out there beware- if you hate Gilbert Gottfried, you will be hearing his voice plenty of times while your kids are sitting on the living room floor and watching this movie.  It WILL get on your nerves.However, despite Gilbert's voice, he's actually funny.  He tags along with Jack and climbs the beanstalk.  By the way, how freaky IS it to think about climbing a beanstalk all the way to the sky?  I was getting light-headed and weak-stomached watching Jack and Gilbert's goose character navigate their way to the top.Once they reach the top, they meet a man holding a harp who reveals his daughter has been taken away.  There was a joke here that I believe they beat into the ground- every time Jack or Gilbert mentioned ""Destiny's Harp"" the man would cry.  It was a little much.  They also eventually meet a HILARIOUS backwards Chevy Chase character and an adorable girl who Jack has a crush on.  She turns out to be on their side and knows how to kick some mean butt!There was definitely some creepiness in the atmosphere.  The foggy areas with the whispering voices is one such example, and just the quiet tone of the borderline heavenly atmosphere is another.Perhaps the ending could have been better.  I didn't care for it much.  Then again, I don't remember the story too well and how it was supposed to end.  However, I believe it could have been more exciting considering the adventurous tone that dominated most of the storyline.Overall, this is NOT for adults, haha.  I felt a little guilty for enjoying it as much as I did.  It's most certainly a childrens fairytale movie.  A must watch for children.",4,so darn silly- REALLY silly in fact... but it's a nice kids movie,1313452800,"08 16, 2011",2011,2695,"['Jack', 'Beanstalk', 'really', 'really', '*strange*', 'think', 'supposed', 'be', 'point', 'so', 'perhaps', ""'m"", 'just', 'surprised', 'how', 'accurate', 'fairytale', 'aspect', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'Yes', 'child', 'beanstalk', 'way', 'storyline', '-and', 'especially', 'outrageous', 'characters', 'way-', 'really', 'unique', 'Unique', 'best', 'way', 'describe', 'it.What', 'especially', 'strange', 'very', 'beginning-', 'Jack', 'small', 'boy', 'who', 'apparently', 'up', 'very', 'secluded', 'town', 'beautiful', 'land', 'beautiful', 'houses', 'people', 'however', 'are', 'FAR', 'beautiful', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'REALIZE', 'was', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', 'playing', 'character', 'school', 'teacher', 'wrinkles', 'face', 'haha', 'facial', 'expressions', 'are', 'awesome', 'always', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'played', 'role', 'strict', 'teacher', 'high', 'expectations', 'students.The', 'main', 'reason', 'dropped', 'rating', 'one', 'point', 'goose', 'character', 'played', 'Gilbert', 'Gottfried', 'do', 'NOT', 'need', 'abundance', 'OR', 'screechy', 'high-pitched', 'voice', 'haha', 'parents', 'there', 'beware-', 'hate', 'Gilbert', 'Gottfried', 'will', 'be', 'hearing', 'voice', 'plenty', 'times', 'kids', 'are', 'sitting', 'living', 'room', 'floor', 'watching', 'movie', 'WILL', 'get', 'nerves.However', 'Gilbert', 'voice', 'actually', 'funny', 'Jack', 'climbs', 'beanstalk', 'way', 'how', 'freaky', 'think', 'climbing', 'beanstalk', 'way', 'sky', 'was', 'getting', 'light-headed', 'weak-stomached', 'watching', 'Jack', 'Gilbert', 'goose', 'character', 'navigate', 'way', 'top.Once', 'reach', 'top', 'meet', 'man', 'holding', 'harp', 'who', 'daughter', 'been', 'taken', 'away', 'was', 'joke', 'here', 'believe', 'beat', 'ground-', 'time', 'Jack', 'Gilbert', 'mentioned', 'Destiny', 'Harp', 'man', 'would', 'cry', 'was', 'little', 'much', 'also', 'eventually', 'meet', 'HILARIOUS', 'backwards', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'character', 'adorable', 'girl', 'who', 'Jack', 'crush', 'out', 'be', 'side', 'how', 'kick', 'mean', 'butt', 'was', 'definitely', 'creepiness', 'atmosphere', 'foggy', 'areas', 'whispering', 'voices', 'one', 'such', 'example', 'just', 'quiet', 'tone', 'borderline', 'heavenly', 'atmosphere', 'ending', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'Then', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'story', 'too', 'well', 'how', 'was', 'supposed', 'end', 'However', 'believe', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'exciting', 'considering', 'adventurous', 'tone', 'dominated', 'most', 'storyline.Overall', 'NOT', 'adults', 'haha', 'felt', 'little', 'guilty', 'enjoying', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'most', 'certainly', 'childrens', 'fairytale', 'movie', 'must', 'watch', 'children']",N/A

1328150,A3UZFB2LEZYWCT,B0036K9CFA,"JLL ""jamesndir""","[20, 20]","I wanted to jump into this and write a review mostly because of the overt hostility of two of the current reviewers.  I guess I am at a loss for their angst.  We rented it and my three kids (4,6,8) really liked it so we wanted to buy it and I stumbled on the horrible reviews.  Another reviewer has done a nice job summarizing the story and characters but the brief review:  This is a fun and family friendly movie for the late preschool crowd and up (the giant and his henchman might be scary for some early preschoolers or toddlers but they are overall pretty mild).  It is not Shakespeare, it is not an action movie, it is simply a silly and fun little take on the Jack and the Beanstalk story.  If you want something else or expect it, you will be disappointed.  Yes the goose who lays the golden egg is Gilbert Gottfried but to comment on the one reviewers anger, I really think they cast a man in the role because Gilbert has such a distinctive voice and is recognized from many other children's characters especially birds like Cyberchase-Digit and Aladdin-Iago).  I do not believe it should be a call to arms to boycott the movie.  Sure they could have found a great female and sure it was a little weird having a male goose lay an egg but he did a great job and my kids did not make anything of it.  I think there were some clever ideas thrown in there.  The ""COW"" he sells is a computer game system like a playstation (COW is an acronym).  Chevy Chases character is funny.  The idea of Jack's dad being a hero by sacrifice is in there, also Jack does not know this initially so he is told by everyone he will amount to nothing but he overcomes this and believes in himself, making others believe in him as well.  Not bad.  Anyway a fun, silly movie to watch with the family.",5,"No need for hostility, really!",1274054400,"05 17, 2010",2010,1784,"['wanted', 'jump', 'write', 'review', 'mostly', 'overt', 'hostility', 'two', 'current', 'reviewers', 'guess', 'am', 'loss', 'angst', 'rented', 'three', 'kids', '4,6,8', 'really', 'liked', 'wanted', 'buy', 'stumbled', 'horrible', 'reviews', 'reviewer', 'done', 'nice', 'job', 'summarizing', 'story', 'characters', 'brief', 'review', 'fun', 'family', 'friendly', 'movie', 'late', 'preschool', 'crowd', 'up', 'giant', 'henchman', 'might', 'be', 'scary', 'early', 'preschoolers', 'toddlers', 'are', 'overall', 'pretty', 'mild', 'not', 'Shakespeare', 'not', 'action', 'movie', 'simply', 'silly', 'fun', 'little', 'take', 'Jack', 'Beanstalk', 'story', 'want', 'something', 'else', 'expect', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Yes', 'goose', 'who', 'golden', 'egg', 'Gilbert', 'Gottfried', 'comment', 'one', 'reviewers', 'anger', 'really', 'think', 'cast', 'man', 'role', 'Gilbert', 'distinctive', 'voice', 'recognized', 'many', 'other', 'children', 'characters', 'especially', 'birds', 'Cyberchase-Digit', 'Aladdin-Iago', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'should', 'be', 'call', 'arms', 'boycott', 'movie', 'Sure', 'could', 'have', 'found', 'great', 'female', 'sure', 'was', 'little', 'weird', 'having', 'male', 'goose', 'lay', 'egg', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'kids', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'anything', 'think', 'were', 'clever', 'ideas', 'thrown', 'there', 'COW', 'computer', 'game', 'system', 'playstation', 'COW', 'acronym', 'Chevy', 'Chases', 'character', 'funny', 'idea', 'Jack', 'dad', 'being', 'hero', 'sacrifice', 'there', 'also', 'Jack', 'not', 'know', 'initially', 'told', 'everyone', 'will', 'amount', 'nothing', 'making', 'others', 'believe', 'as', 'well', 'Not', 'bad', 'Anyway', 'fun', 'silly', 'movie', 'watch', 'family']",N/A
