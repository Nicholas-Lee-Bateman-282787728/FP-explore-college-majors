1509032,A1EBOEB2DXOMIK,B0063DOV76,"Amazon Customer ""C. Dennis Moore""","[0, 0]","I&#8217;m always suspicious of a movie that claims to be &#8220;based on&#8221; or &#8220;inspired by actual events.&#8221;  I know right away that the movie I&#8217;m about to watch could be anywhere from about 90% true all the way down to 1% true.For example, in the movie THE CONJURING, do I believe there was a presence in that house?  I do.  Do I believe that presence possessed the mother, made her chair float into the air, turn upside down, and result in anything even remotely resembling the climax of that movie?  Not even a little bit, do I believe that.In the movie THE PERFECT STORM, with Clooney and Wahlberg, do I believe a boat sank during a storm?  Yep.  Do I believe ANY of the events that occurred on that boat, as depicted in the movie, once it left harbor were accurate?  Not one bit.  There were no survivors, so everything in the second and third acts of that movie are entirely made up.Which leads us to Bill Bennett&#8217;s 2010 movie UNINHABITED.  This is the story of young lovers Beth (Gerladine Hakewill, WASTED ON THE YOUNG) and Harry (Henry James, no other credits), on holiday for 10 days off the Great Barrier Reef of Australia.  They have an entire island to themselves.  They do a few things that have four letters and start with F, &#8220;fish&#8221; being one of those things, and they generally have a grand time.  For about a day.Then they start to hear weird noises in the jungle.  They start to see strange footprints in the sand.  Someone hangs all of Beth&#8217;s underwear, even the leopard print ones, in a tree outside their tent.  They&#8217;re sure they&#8217;re not alone, so they explore more of the island and come upon a small shack not far from their camp.They also spot a couple of Russian poachers off the island, shooting sharks with a rifle.Beth decides she&#8217;s ready to leave early, but the satellite phone is missing.  The Russians took it, Harry decides.  They head over there, demand it back, but are soon captured by the two angry men.  Before the dirty one can further violate Beth, the hairier one calls his partner over to help him investigate noises in the woods.  Soon the two are running back to their boat, the dirty one bleeding, and Beth and Harry escape back to their own camp.Something is definitely on the island with them.  But when they head back to the shack the next day and Beth thinks she&#8217;s discovered the secret, Harry wants no part of it, and refuses to see all the signs.UNINHABITED definitely plays it close and keeps a lot of its secrets hidden until the perfect time, leading the viewer, at first, to believe the poachers are the big danger on the island.  That would have been terrible, especially to have two unreasonable and vicious dudes like that coming after you, with no way off the island for another week.  But then, to find the truth is much worse and that, if history is any indication, there is absolutely NOTHING you can do to stop it, that&#8217;s even worse.  Hell, with the Russians, you can say take the girl, just don&#8217;t hurt me--I kid, I kid--but the thing on the island, if it&#8217;s real (and Harry hopes it&#8217;s not), there&#8217;s no reasoning, no compromise, and no escape.UNINHABITED wasn&#8217;t a great movie, but it wasn&#8217;t terrible.I think it was FULL of clich&eacute;s, like the Russian poachers, the mysterious diary they find in the shack that just conveniently tells the history of the place, the videotaped scenes of Beth and Harry sleeping in their tent, the way too obvious early &#8220;don&#8217;t step on that, it&#8217;s deadly&#8221; scene which you don&#8217;t have to be Roger Ebert to know is going to come into play again before the end of the movie.I mean, it felt like Bennett just had a checklist of all the things a movie like this was supposed to include, and he made sure to use them all.On the other hand, clich&eacute;s aside, I thought it was well-shot.  One shot of Harry finding a cell phone in the shack was particularly effective.The acting was 50/50 for me.  Beth and Harry are the only two characters who get any serious screen time, and for the length of the movie, I believed Beth and was annoyed by Harry.  For several reasons.  First, it sounded like Harry&#8217;s every line was dubbed in later.  I know ADR is a part of the process and it&#8217;s used in every movie, but something about the quality of Harry&#8217;s lines didn&#8217;t match Beth&#8217;s, which made everything he said sound like it was added in later.  Second, there was a believability missing from Harry&#8217;s delivery.  Beth seemed to be enjoying herself, then she seemed to be scared.  Harry seemed to be trying to make sure he hit his mark and got his lines right.  I just didn&#8217;t buy it.And the final thing that made the movie only partially work for me was, it just wasn&#8217;t very exciting.  Bennett shot a beautiful movie, and he keeps the eye engaged at all times.  But the pace he establishes for the action is too slow.  In the whole 88 minutes, there were maybe two tense scene: the capture by the Russians, and the scene with the cell phone.  Everything else came and went, but none of it was really designed to raise your blood pressure.  It was pretty, sure, but it was also pretty dull for the most part.The ending was telegraphed within the first ten minutes of the movie, and I hated being right when it happened.  Overall, UNINHABITED is okay at best.  It doesn&#8217;t make me want to track down more Bennett movies, nor does it intrigue me enough to delve into the backstory and find out just what news article the movie was &#8220;based on&#8221;.  Honestly, there&#8217;s every possibility it was &#8220;based on&#8221; something so simple as &#8220;Couple Goes on Holiday, Wife Stubs Toe.&#8221;I&#8217;m glad I got to see it as it makes me definitely want to visit the Great Barrier Reefs.  But as a movie, as a story, it didn&#8217;t excite me at all.",3,Uninhabited,1393200000,"02 24, 2014",2014,5930,"['8217', 'always', 'suspicious', 'movie', 'be', '8220', 'based', '8221', '8220',

1509033,A33EN2ZL2MS0CI,B0063DOV76,Compay,"[2, 3]","For being a straight-to-DVD movie, Uninhabited is surprisingly excellent when it comes to the cinematography. Otherwise, it's a pretty standard haunting flick, just with a different setting than other ghost movies.  Uninhabited is about an attractive young couple that take a vacation to a deserted coral island on the Great Barrier Reef of Australia. But it isn't long before Harry and Beth discover that they may not be alone.Despite this being a low-budget movie shot with a skeleton crew, the visuals really stand out. The footage of the Queensland, Australia beach is beautiful, and makes for an interesting setting to a ghost movie. Uninhabited marks Aussie director Bill Bennett's first return to shooting a feature film in over eight years. So it's refreshing to see this quality of directing for a simple horror flick.The bad news is that the concept of the film isn't incredibly original. While most haunting movies don't take place on a deserted island, the general plot ideas come off as familiar. The first half of the film, there's a genuine feeling of suspense as you try to figure out what is actually happening to the couple, and why. But there's a bit of an easy cop-out as to how the audience discovers the island's secret, and by that point, the suspense sort of fizzles out.Uninhabited was billed as being ""inspired by a real-life incident,"" which is pretty vague. Only after some digging was I able to find out that writer/director Bill Bennett had a fearful experience when staying at a similar deserted island with his brother and their girlfriends years ago. Bennett never goes into detail about what happened, but cryptically states that there was someone or something on the island with them. So it's a bit misleading that any of the more dangerous elements of Uninhabited had ever occurred in real life.Despite being a newbie actress when this film was shot, the beautiful Geraldine Hakewill offers a surprisingly good performance as Beth.  The same can't be said for actor Henry James, which isn't a surprise considering Uninhabited was his first and only feature film to date.  He comes off as a surfer that was cast only because of his looks, which unfortunately hurts the film overall.If you're a diehard fan of supernatural horror movies, especially those with a revenge theme, Uninhabited is worth renting or watching online. Just don't expect Gothika, or The Grudge. It's a slow-burning movie, so if prefer a fast-paced horror flick, Uninhabited isn't for you. I'd say give this one a watch first, before you consider actually buying the DVD.",3,Amazing Visuals but an Average Story,1346457600,"09 1, 2012",2012,2577,"['being', 'straight-to-DVD', 'movie', 'Uninhabited', 'surprisingly', 'excellent', 'when', 'cinematography', 'Otherwise', 'pretty', 'standard', 'haunting', 'flick', 'just', 'different', 'setting', 'other', 'ghost', 'movies', 'Uninhabited', 'attractive', 'young', 'couple', 'take', 'vacation', 'deserted', 'coral', 'island', 'Great', 'Barrier', 'Reef', 'Australia', ""n't"", 'long', 'before', 'Harry', 'Beth', 'discover', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'alone.Despite', 'being', 'low-budget', 'movie', 'shot', 'skeleton', 'crew', 'visuals', 'really', 'stand', 'out', 'footage', 'Queensland', 'Australia', 'beach', 'beautiful', 'interesting', 'setting', 'ghost', 'movie', 'Uninhabited', 'marks', 'Aussie', 'director', 'Bill', 'Bennett', 'first', 'return', 'shooting', 'feature', 'film', 'eight', 'years', 'refreshing', 'see', 'quality', 'directing', 'simple', 'horror', 'flick.The', 'bad', 'news', 'concept', 'film', ""n't"", 'incredibly', 'original', 'most', 'haunting', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'place', 'deserted', 'island', 'general', 'plot', 'ideas', 'come', 'off', 'familiar', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'genuine', 'feeling', 'suspense', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'actually', 'happening', 'couple', 'why', 'bit', 'easy', 'cop-out', 'how', 'audience', 'island', 'secret', 'point', 'suspense', 'sort', 'fizzles', 'out.Uninhabited', 'was', 'billed', 'being', 'inspired', 'real-life', 'incident', 'pretty', 'vague', 'Only', 'digging', 'was', 'able', 'find', 'out', 'writer/director', 'Bill', 'Bennett', 'had', 'fearful', 'experience', 'when', 'staying', 'similar', 'deserted', 'island', 'brother', 'girlfriends', 'years', 'ago', 'Bennett', 'never', 'detail', 'what', 'happened', 'cryptically', 'was', 'someone', 'something', 'island', 'bit', 'misleading', 'more', 'dangerous', 'elements', 'Uninhabited', 'had', 'ever', 'occurred', 'real', 'life.Despite', 'being', 'newbie', 'actress', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'beautiful', 'Geraldine', 'Hakewill', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'performance', 'Beth', 'same', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'said', 'actor', 'Henry', 'James', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'considering', 'Uninhabited', 'was', 'first', 'only', 'feature', 'film', 'date', 'off', 'surfer', 'was', 'cast', 'only', 'looks', 'unfortunately', 'film', 'overall.If', ""'re"", 'diehard', 'fan', 'supernatural', 'horror', 'movies', 'especially', 'revenge', 'theme', 'Uninhabited', 'worth', 'renting', 'watching', 'online', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Gothika', 'Grudge', 'slow-burning', 'movie', 'so', 'prefer', 'fast-paced', 'horror', 'flick', 'Uninhabited', ""n't"", ""'d"", 'say', 'give', 'one', 'watch', 'first', 'consider', 'actually', 'buying', 'DVD']",N/A

Their peaceful vacation is interrupted when they find mysterious footprints, things are mysteriously moved/misplaced, and when they find a deserted cabin.First, you should know this is a slow horror film. It doesn't only work off of jump-out scares and it doesn't throw them at the audience often. Instead, it works off of tension and a slow build up. I personally love slow-burners, but Uninhabited doesn't really work efficiently as a slow burner; I mean, it has some very tense and creepy moments, but they didn't really lead to anything truly scary. I did like the idea of a haunted island, I thought it was very interesting and slightly innovative. Also, the film has great music and is shot beautifully. Acting was decent, nothing special but not terrible either; I should note, some of the dialogue felt very forced and unrealistic. The ending was also okay, could've been better.Overall, Uninhabited is a decent film. If you're looking for something petrifying, this is not it.
