494444,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000006GFI,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","What could be easily dismissed as another `white man saves black people' movie, `Conrack' should get some slack for being inspired of a true story and yet probably held a little more critically for the very same reason.I was moved by the film and found it to be entertaining and well performed all the way around (Voight is VERY good) and yet I couldn't help but feel as if this film was so whitewashed it was pathetic.  The lengths gone to make Pat Conroy a hero in the eyes of all seems out of place and, from what I've read by other reviewers, unauthentic.  It makes for an uplifting Hollywood biopic, but I'd prefer to see the truth behind the whitewashing.  I really wanted to see the earthy grit behind it all and not just another portrayal of a beacon of `white' light manifested over the uneducated black folk trying desperately to stay under the radar so-to-speak.Still, Voight and Madge Sinclair are very good here and the cinematography is stunning.  Sadly, the kids are given little to do and the film seems to have little interest in them (another avenue of whitewashing, since the sole focal point is on Conroy instead of the students he helped).  If you like your standard `teacher/student' dramas then this one will do and you'll certainly enjoy it since most of the technical elements are WAY up to par, but if you want something that feels genuine and unaffected by obvious manipulations then I'd avoid this one.",3,It just didn't feel real...,1347840000,"09 17, 2012",2012,1430,"['What', 'could', 'be', 'easily', 'dismissed', 'white', 'man', 'black', 'people', 'movie', 'Conrack', 'should', 'get', 'slack', 'being', 'inspired', 'true', 'story', 'yet', 'probably', 'held', 'little', 'more', 'critically', 'very', 'same', 'reason.I', 'was', 'moved', 'film', 'found', 'be', 'entertaining', 'well', 'performed', 'way', 'Voight', 'VERY', 'good', 'yet', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'whitewashed', 'was', 'pathetic', 'lengths', 'gone', 'make', 'Pat', 'Conroy', 'hero', 'eyes', 'place', 'what', ""'ve"", 'read', 'other', 'reviewers', 'unauthentic', 'uplifting', 'Hollywood', 'biopic', ""'d"", 'prefer', 'see', 'truth', 'whitewashing', 'really', 'wanted', 'see', 'earthy', 'grit', 'not', 'just', 'portrayal', 'beacon', 'white', 'light', 'manifested', 'uneducated', 'black', 'folk', 'trying', 'desperately', 'stay', 'radar', 'so-to-speak.Still', 'Voight', 'Madge', 'Sinclair', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'here', 'cinematography', 'stunning', 'Sadly', 'kids', 'are', 'given', 'little', 'do', 'film', 'have', 'little', 'interest', 'avenue', 'whitewashing', 'sole', 'focal', 'point', 'Conroy', 'instead', 'students', 'helped', 'like', 'standard', 'teacher/student', 'dramas', 'then', 'one', 'will', 'do', ""'ll"", 'certainly', 'enjoy', 'most', 'technical', 'elements', 'are', 'WAY', 'par', 'want', 'something', 'genuine', 'unaffected', 'obvious', 'manipulations', 'then', ""'d"", 'avoid', 'one']",Conrack VHS

Jon Voight plays a young schoolteacher who goes to an island off the coast of South Carolina and confronts poverty and ignorance. He brings a fresh style and approach to education to his all black classroom, and soon has the kids eagerly learning and gaining some self-respect. It all goes down the tubes, though, when he crosses with the redneck superintendent over a Halloween outing, and he gets fired.Voight is excellent as the teacher (the ""-roy"" in his name comes out ""-rack"" in the island's dialect, thus the title), and watching him go through his paces is uplifting. The good vs. evil theme can be overly blatant at times, and Voight's driving a van with loudspeakers attached as he admonishes the town (Beaufort) for firing him is over-the-top sentimentality (as is the ending with all the kids lined up on the deck to see him go, as expected as it might be), but the movie is effective and strong most of the time.[I see on Amazon that the release date for this movie on DVD is 2010!

Based on the book &quot;The Water is Wide&quot; by Pat Conroy this is a real 1970`s movie.  It is about hope and love and equality. It is about the magic of learning and the power of teaching. It`s about all the things we are supposed, as a country, to have given up on and rushed, headlong into consumerism. If that is where you are, and you think anyone foolish that thinks otherwise, this is not the film for you. If you hold out hope for the human race, and see promise in the eyes of those who would be more than they are, and those who would see them achieve that goal, you will have a wonderous experience here. It is a celebration of those who would share knowledge, and the joy of those who discover the joy of learning. Jon Voight has never had a more powerful vehicle, and his fellow cast members make this a film once seen, never forgotten.

He achieved a glimmering one in this hidden gem adapted from author Pat Conroy's novel, &quot;The Water Is Wide.&quot; Its movie version, retitled &quot;Conrack,&quot; has the amazing Jon Voight in the real-life role of teacher that Conroy played for a year on a South Carolina island inhabited by mostly African-Americans living in absolutely poverty and ignorance, and virtually forgotten by the world outside. The illiterate children, unable to pronounce Conroy's name, can do no better than &quot;Conrack,&quot; thus, the title. Realizing all too soon that he has the near insurmountable challenge of teaching what school administrators have dismissed as the unteachable, Conrack comes up with the strategy of teaching by applying knowledge to his childrens' everyday lives. His efforts, and the childrens' steadily emerging ability to learn, make for an assortment of human emotions, from frustration to out-and-out howling to the bittersweet of the childrens' recognition and acceptance of their lot in life. But while teaching and learning make progress, school administrators are less than impressed by Conrack's methods, and the film head toward the inevitable clash between teacher and school officials and the resolution, we are lead to conclude, is at the childrens' expense. As Conrack, Voight is both stirring and moving without being phony, and he convinces us that the teacher's only agenda is his pupils' betterment. But the child actors who make up the pupils are incredible! They actually make us believe we are listening to a socially and educationally decimated and totally forgotten other world. The film is all the more powerful with Conroy's novel read beforehand for background.

Since I first saw this movie as a child, it has been my very favorite movie of all time.  The sweetness he, as a teacher, shows his students, and the respect and love they return are so dear.  The message of giving all children the best education possible, the most experiences to broaden their horizons, and even making education fun are still appropriate today.He is a teacher on a very poor island in the south.  His students have never been off the island.  They have had very limited education and the principal of the school feels these kids won't amount to much.  As the new teacher, he does all he can to make the kids feel they are all important, he makes learning fun, he tells them about the world off the island, and even takes them on field trips off the island.I HIGHLY recommend this movie.  I have seen it many times, and look forward to getting it on DVD so I can watch it again with a clear picture (my VHS tape is wearing out, I've watched it so much).This is a great movie for the entire family.  It opens up doors for great topics of conversation, including being yourself and standing up for what you belive in.  You just can't go wrong with this movie!",5,Sweet...touching...funny...,1145404800,"04 19, 2006",2006,1319,"['story', 'wonderful', 'message', 'movie', 'acted', 'so', 'beautifully', 'so', 'much', 'sweetness', 'laughs', 'many', 'special', 'moments', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', 'child', 'been', 'very', 'favorite', 'movie', 'time', 'sweetness', 'teacher', 'students', 'respect', 'love', 'return', 'are', 'so', 'dear', 'message', 'giving', 'children', 'best', 'education', 'possible', 'most', 'experiences', 'broaden', 'horizons', 'even', 'making', 'education', 'fun', 'are', 'still', 'appropriate', 'today.He', 'teacher', 'very', 'poor', 'island', 'south', 'students', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'off', 'island', 'have', 'had', 'very', 'limited', 'education', 'principal', 'school', 'kids', 'wo', ""n't"", 'amount', 'much', 'new', 'teacher', 'all', 'can', 'make', 'kids', 'feel', 'are', 'important', 'learning', 'fun', 'world', 'island', 'even', 'field', 'trips', 'island.I', 'HIGHLY', 'recommend', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'times', 'look', 'forward', 'getting', 'DVD', 'can', 'watch', 'again', 'clear', 'picture', 'VHS', 'tape', 'wearing', 'out', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'so', 'much', '.This', 'great', 'movie', 'entire', 'family', 'up', 'doors', 'great', 'topics', 'conversation', 'including', 'being', 'standing', 'up', 'what', 'belive', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'movie']",Conrack VHS
