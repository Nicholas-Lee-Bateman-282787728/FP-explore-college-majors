Taking place in Victorian era Toronto, William Murdoch is a detective with a penchant for creating unique crime fighting tools and experimenting with forensics. Famous individuals throughout history make appearances in various episodes - Arthur Conan Doyle, Nikolai Tesla to name just two.

I very quickly came to like all the characters, was very entertained by the charming writing and found the stories/mysteries to have a unique feel to them.

1614355,ATSY5RT6UBIHI,B00ANGICPG,kingomusic,"[18, 20]","I have to say, I jumped on this bandwagon along with everyone else who watches these shows.  Great period background and the cast is perfect.  I thought after watching the three movies that I wouldn't like a change in the lead character, but after watching two episodes, the change was seamless.  I like the twists that always seem to pop up right at the end, you think you have the culprit figured out and wham!  Totally turn in the road.  I also like the storylines, using turn of the century new advancements in solving crime that only a few seem to accept readily.  Fingerprinting, insect larvae age, etc., it all adds to the great entertainment.  It seems like you sit down, start the show and before you know it, it's ending.  Now that is both great story telling, and acting.
