The acting by the lead actor playing the character Pim (not sue of his name) was super good and I thought the storyline was complex and made the film worth making. It is a love story with sidelines about the youngsters home life and I can understand why he needed some love outside the home. Will not say a thing about how it ends but, would recommend it as a GREAT gay movie. I rented it from the big rental company and went right to Amazon to purchase it after returning it to the rental company.

Clay ""drakkar91""","[4, 6]","While the coming-of-age story has been told many times before (and will continue to be told), this film does a sweet and sensitive justice to the yearning for love and desire.  Our young lead (Pim) longs for his older friend Gino.  When the two young lives intersect one day in the garage, Pim dreams of something far greater.  But the reality turns cold for Pim as Gino shy's away from any emotional connection to Pim.When you consider films of a similar story line that have come before (Beautiful Thing,Summer Storm,Edge of Seventeen), this one is well done, but not one that will stand out in my long list of favorite movies.  That said, it turns strong performances from the young male leads, the two mothers, and most of the supporting cast.  It's believable, and Pim's character is one the viewer can connect with and embrace.This is essentially a coming-of-age drama, that tends to slow down in the second half of the film as lives become unraveled.  Unlike my other favorites referenced above, you won't find much (if anything) to laugh about in this film.  I didn't find myself grasped by the storyline, nor would I watch it a second time.  However, it's well worth your time, and at least the ending won't leave you feeling depressed.

1601800,AFZU6XDO5L75R,B009SFR2QI,"Darien Wells ""darien""","[13, 14]","This isn't the easiest review to write. My emotions are mixed on this one. I love the film, I just wish I understood all of it. It was difficult for me to follow. Perhaps it is the language barrier, or moreso the cultural barrier I suppose. The film is in Dutch with English subtitles, and while the English translation is fine where the words are concerned, perhaps the culture doesn't quite get translated. If I were Dutch I might understand it better, but to an American there is a lot here that is very much foreign and more difficult to follow.The story is rather simple but there were places that just lost me. The beginning made little sense until several minutes into the film. Don't be impatient. Stay with it and give the film a chance to draw you into it's plot. A very handsome lead actor: Jelle Florizoone, plays as ""Pim"" a boy who has grown up in the home of a single mother who has issues of her own and is more concerned about her own happiness than the general welfare of her child. Pim is a very quiet young man who lives in a world all his own. He rarely opens up to anyone, and dreams a lot about the love and affection that has never really been a reality in his life. The object of his attractions is the equally handsome ""Gino"".The attraction is quite obviously mutual, but Gino (very well portrayed by Mathias  Vergels), being older, is a lot more outgoing and open to explore other possibilities. The two hit it off quite well and share a beautiful, erotic relationship which defines to Pim everything he has always dreamed of. For Gino however, it's just not the romance of a lifetime. His search for love is a little more uncertain, and will take time and exploration to figure out who he is and what he truly longs for.Meanwhile Gino's little sister Sabrina has fallen head over heels for Pim, until she uncovers the truth of his affection for her brother. Gino and Sabrina's mother, also a single parent, takes Pim under her wing to show him the love and understanding that she alone seems to realize he has never known. Mom also seems to understand a bit more about Pim and Gino than they might expect. She is also very ill and soon these three may be left to figure things out without her guidance.The acting is SUPERB all the way around. Florizoone is not only visually appealing to the camera, but his acting is right on target with the character he portrays. A haunting look at the life of a child who has somehow managed to grow up without the guidance of a father and with a mother who needs as much parenting as he does. Very well directed and I do recommend this film for your viewing pleasure.I'm a bit disappointed as the film didn't quite live up to my expectations and I feel an English version might have made a little more sense in spots and made the whole plot more enjoyable to watch. Keep in mind it is a foreign film and don't expect more than it can deliver. You will fall in love with Pim and be rooting for a happy ending.

At one time Pim's mother was apparently a beauty queen and Pim puts on her crown, sash and necklace. When his mother catches him he is wearing the crown, the sash, the necklace, and nothing else. (I will point out that although he quickly covers his genitals with his hands when she comes into the room, it actually did not matter because the sash was already covering them.)After getting dressed he runs to a nearby house where another single mother lives with her two children; Gino who is about two years older than Pim, and Sabrina who is about a year younger than Pim.Ten minutes into the movie it jumps forward in time to the day before Pim's 15th birthday, which he spends with the nearby family. His mother has left him home alone while going out of town with a man. This is where the true storyline begins to develop. It is easy to see that Sabrina is smitten with Pim, but with the help of a flash back we see that Pim is smitten with Gino. It is the night before Pim turns 15 that Pim and Gino's relationship turns truly sexual. (The flash back has sexual overtones, but no sex between them.)The movie continues from here over a few years following the relationships between Pim and Gino, Pim and Sabrina, Gino and a girlfriend he eventually moves in with, as well as Pim's mother's relationship with men. The storyline also develops a back story about Gino and Sabrina's father.There are other complications and interweaving of the storyline which I will not get into because I don't want to give to much away for those who have not seen the movie.

1601816,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B009SFR2QI,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[51, 55]","The Belgian coming-of-age tale ""North Sea Texas"" might not win any awards for originality as you're certain to have seen dozens of films to follow a similar story arc.  Despite its familiarity, though, it still works as an exploration of the sexual and romantic awakening of an awkward teen stranded in a desolate seaside village.  Before going any further, let me clarify that Bavo Defurne's debut feature is NOT set in Texas.  While I think this would be perfectly clear from the description, I just thought that I would mention it as the prospect of subtitles seems to put off certain viewers.  But, as they say, love is universal.  And the yearning and emotions inherent throughout ""North Sea Texas"" are sure to resonate with anyone who has ever had a crush or experienced the complications of first love.The boy at the center of ""North Sea Texas"" is Pim (Jelle Florizoone).  Although we glimpse a younger version of Pim in the movie's opening sequence, the narrative covers about three years as he reaches adulthood.  Living with his single mother, who likes her evenings out, Pim has taken on the mantle of responsibility around the homestead.  Aloof and introspective, drawing is his passion.  But, like most, he is looking for someone with whom to share his interests and desires.  Improbably, an older neighborhood boy named Gino (Mathias Vergels) becomes the object of Pim's adoration.  As the two boys share in some youthful indiscretions, it seems only a matter of time before Gino stretches toward his own independence and livelihood.  Pim is left to deal with the change in their relationship as well as a number of other issues in his family life.  Though the screenplay focuses primarily on Pim, his mother, a returning lodger, and Gino's family also come to affect the boy's maturation.Again, it's easy to identify with the themes in ""North Sea Texas.""  One of the reasons that films keep depicting similar coming-of-age stories is that there is an underlying truthfulness in the shared experience of growing up.  Everyone has had unrequited feelings, everyone has been flush with happiness and idealism, and everyone has even had a broken heart or two.  I liked the understated approach of ""North Sea Texas"" and the fact that much of the movie dealt with Pim's struggles in rather subtle ways.  There aren't big speeches or bold dramatic moments, most of the changes that occur in Pim's life do so silently or off screen.  The camera zooms in close to Pim as he processes and/or reacts to what has happened, but very little is verbalized.

His darting eyes take in everything: his mother's childish and irresponsible behavior, his friend's sister's obsession with him, the sexiness of the gypsy Zoltan, and so forth. Nothing escapes him, and nothing protects him from hurt. Both he and his best friend Gino each lives in a fatherless family. At first the duo is inseparable, and make love, but since Gino is three years older, he soon begins a relationship with Franoise, and abandons younger Pim. This breaks his heart. Gino's mother, who has kidney problems, takes pity on Pim and invites him to come live with her when the boy's mother runs off with the gypsy. Pim sleeps in Gino's room. But the mother is soon hospitalized, and just before she dies, she takes Gino's hand and places it in Pim's. Amazingly sensitive and compassionate, compared to the ""action picture"" crop of junk we get here. Think back to your adolescence and remember how you suffered when someone you loved didn't return your feelings.

It is a story of love and fantasy between 15yo Pim in Holland and his 18yo neighbor, Gino.  The older boy is handsome and seductive and they share a lovely, secret romance until Gino meets a girl.There are other interesting characters:  Pim's mother is an overweight, former beauty queen who is a part-time singer.  She shares one thing with her son:  they both dream of love and a better life.Gino's mother is ill but the family takes Pim under their wing.  Gino's teenage sister complicates things a bit when she falls for Pim who cannot requite her love.This would be a five-star film (lovely young actors, interesting script, nice cinematography) except for a couple of production problems.  About 80% of the subtitles are indecipherable being white with no outline, so, all too often they blend with a light background and cannot be read at all, or only in part.  The story is fairly straight-forward but, still, this is quite an unnecessary annoyance.  Even at the end, during over four minutes of closing credits against a black background, not one word is readable as the font it so small -- and I have a large screen!A disappointed and rejected Pim finally destroys all his kept treasures of Gino.
