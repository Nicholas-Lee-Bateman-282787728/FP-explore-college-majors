1679105,AGEIT17HENDIS,B00GMV8KGW,Alfred Johnson,"[2, 3]","As a member in good standing of the generation of &#8217;68, and a child of the early 1960s folk minute I was all ears when I heard that the film under review, Inside Llewyn Davis written and directed by the Coen Brothers had been released (although I was not sure that the guys behind Fargo, Raising Arizona and the like would have the proper appreciation for that minute). You all know all about that folk minute or have heard about it, the time when old songs and new versions by troubadours and vagabonds located mainly in places like the Village, Harvard Square, Ann Arbor, Old Town, and North Beach threatened to put rock and roll on its ear. Of course that rock and roll in the early 1960s was stuff like Tell Laura I Love Her, Teen Angel (and about seven other angelic songs), Moon River and the like. Certainly not the Elvis of his early hungry days with things like One Night, Jerry Lee with High School Confidential, Chuck Berry with Sweet Little Sixteen, or Bo Diddley with Who Do You Love or the later Stones and Beatles explosions which would put that minute in the shade. But with the likes of Bob Dylan, venerable Pete Seeger, Joan Baez, Judy Collins, Tom Rush, Tom Paxton, Phil Ochs, the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem, and Dave Van Ronk there was enough talent to give it a go.That last named singer is important, important for this film because at least superficially the mood of this piece had been said to be inspired by that old folk-singer/songwriter, historian and curmudgeon, Dave Van Ronk. Dave&#8217;s loving biographer, Elijah Wald says no, and from the number of times I saw him perform in person over the years in substantial concert halls and rundown coffeehouses I agree with Brother Wald. But surely the music (literally) is Dave&#8217;s and the mores and culture of the folk scene presented on screen seems about right (although my vantage point was from Harvard Square in Cambridge). You know the struggling folk artists up all night working their trade, bumming cigarettes, drinking wine, maybe smoking a little weed, cadging food and lodging where  they could all for, well, all for art.  And as the plot unfolds our man, Llewyn Davis (played by Oscar Isaac) struts his stuff in just such a manner.Seems though Llewyn is at wit&#8217;s end since losing his partner (to suicide) and is not making it very well in the Gaslight 1961 era just at the opening edge of that folk minute explosion. He is hustling for gigs, working for the &#8220;basket,&#8221; trying to keep body and soul together but is not making it in the Village. So on a tip he grabs a shared expenses ride to Chicago to check out the scene there. This section of the film is the best since beat poet Johnny and hipster jazz man Roland (played by John Goodman) are his traveling companions. Before they hit Chicago though Johnny has a beef with a cop and is arrested and old style be-bop hipster junkie Roland slides into a heroin overdose leaving Llewyn to travel that last stretch alone. In Chicago though it is no dice, no go, and so he heads back to New York. While he tries to hustle some work it is still no go and so he decides to go to sea, go work as a merchant marine (after he settles his union dues and papers issues). In a fit of hubris he spends his last night at the Gaslight mocking one of the performers, a performer whose husband took umbrage and beat him down in the back alley behind the Gaslight. Yeah, vagabond Llewyn, even with all his talent and dreams, is a guy fresh out of luck just then. Just like a million other guys and gals later after that folk minute flamed out. But as the film ends a new scraggly guy from the Midwest with a gravelly voice is shown in outline playing a song, Farewell, that seems to be &#8220;speaking&#8221; to that audience.

As a generalized statement, Llewyn lived the life of many musicians of that era continuing into the 60's folk, folk Rock scene.  He was a self serving two timing pile of irresponsibility that thought only of himself.  I'm a musician and a painter (and from that time period) and I know what it is to live &#34;just a little outside&#34; of the general populace's mainstream thinking.  &#34;Outside looking in.&#34;  Weird!

And I've seen the devastation that living a life like his has left in it's wake.  I'd seen the sub-human creatures that were on the receiving end of it, winding up hating humanity because of their involuntary addiction to people like Llewyn.  Inside Llewyn Davis is a stereotyped cliche that was unfortunately true.  Just look at most of the successful crossovers that played that NYC scene and read accounts of their lives.

The anti-hero is an OK folk singer (so-so voice) who struggles to be true to his art while mooching off everyone in sight and being less than grateful for their generosity to the point of being, deep down, nothing but a real jerk.  The point I guess is that karma gets back at him for this because others with better attitudes prosper all around him.  He is clearly depressed because of the suicide of his singing partner, but his behavior is so consistently unforgivable that you can't rally develop much sympathy for him (oddly, put me in mind of the Wolf of Wall Street).

1679110,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00GMV8KGW,Andrew Ellington,"[7, 11]","The Coen Brothers are one of the most beloved directing duos (possibly THE most beloved) in all the world, and it&#8217;s easy to see why.  Both Joel and Ethan Coen have done their best to cultivate and maintain a pretty impressive resume of films that span genres, themes and circumstance and yet all rest comfortably in the flare of their stylistic dead-pan writing.  They understand humor and how it incorporates itself comfortably into drama, and they know how to spin tales so bizarre they feel authentically human.  Yes, they fail from time to time (and when they do it&#8217;s usually pretty awful) but they&#8217;ve earned to right to fail.Their best is better than most.Since their Oscar win back in 2007, the Coen&#8217;s have been dwelling comfortably in Oscar&#8217;s good graces, racking up nominations for their writing and their films and their actors and their directing and have pretty much become an Oscar staple, so it was easy to see why so many presumed &#8216;Inside Llewyn Davis&#8217; was going to be another big hit for them.  It received unanimous praise at the festival circuit as well as upon its theatrical release, and it looked primed for Oscar acceptance.And then it received a Sound Mixing nomination and NOTHING else.What makes this all the more depressing is that this is possibly their finest film since &#8216;Fargo&#8217;!While the rest of the world was devouring their every output, I was reluctantly holding off until they delivered something that felt tighter, stronger and more in the vein of what I expect from them.  I really like &#8216;No Country for Old Men&#8217;, but to me that wasn&#8217;t a true Coen Brothers film.  &#8216;True Grit&#8217; had a stronger sense of their whit about it, but it still felt muffled under the guess of two beloved directors trying to test out their range.  &#8216;A Serious Man&#8217; felt like a return to their roots, their true form, and yet it was messy and incoherent and really needed some elaboration in parts.&#8216;Inside Llewyn Davis&#8217; is everything that &#8216;A Serious Man&#8217; tried to be and more.The film is kind of a non-story about a musician drifting through life, bouncing from couch to couch and alienating everyone he knows because he&#8217;s, well, not a very nice person.  When the film opens, Llewis is in an smoky bar bellowing a folk song and our attention is instantly stolen and propelled into this journey of self-discovery that feels deeply enriched through the sounds and sights around us.  Using music as a springboard for many other things, &#8216;Inside Llewyn Davis&#8217; is a swell of celestial sounds that heightens the atmospheric presentation and delivers one of the Coen&#8217;s finest composite films.To say this is &#8216;lesser Coen&#8217; is a joke.I love the way that the Coen Brothers present such deeply rooted life lessons without saccharine overtures, dealing out a film that feels uniquely human, if it were.  The interactions between Llewyn and those around him spiral off into splinters of his own life, his own demons as it were, and present a universal truth about the struggle to create, to perform, to live and ultimately to conform.  Llewyn&#8217;s journey feels authentic and gives us a reason to root for such an unsavory character.With star performances throughout, this is an all-around gem of a film.  Carey Mulligan tears apart each of her scenes with a sharp and biting presence that escalates with each passing scene, and John Goodman&#8217;s brief appearance adds an unexpected depth of mystery to the plot and the themes presented, but obviously this is Oscar Isaac&#8217;s film to carry, and boy does he ever!  He encompasses Llewyn Davis&#8217;s every attribute, and his line delivery is laced with an ingrown sadness that permeates his actions and endears us to him, despite his repulsive attitude.  This is a star performance if I ever saw one and it makes me so excited to see where he goes from here.",5,Music of the heart&#8230;,1394668800,"03 13, 2014",2014,3963,"['Coen', 'Brothers', 'are', 'one', 'most', 'beloved', 'directing', 'duos', 'possibly', 'most', 'beloved', 'world', '8217', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'Joel', 'Ethan', 'Coen', 'have', 'done', 'best', 'cultivate', 'maintain', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'resume', 'films', 'span', 'genres', 'themes', 'circumstance', 'yet', 'rest', 'comfortably', 'flare', 'stylistic', 'dead-pan', 'writing', 'understand', 'humor', 'how', 'comfortably', 'drama', 'know', 'how', 'spin', 'tales', 'so', 'feel', 'authentically', 'human', 'Yes', 'fail', 'time', 'time', 'when', 'do', '8217', 'usually', 'pretty', 'awful', '8217', 've', 'earned', 'right', 'fail.Their', 'best', 'better', 'most.Since', 'Oscar', 'win', 'back', '2007', 'Coen', '8217', 's', 'have', 'been', 'dwelling', 'comfortably', 'Oscar', '8217', 'good', 'graces', 'racking', 'up', 'nominations', 'writing', 'films', 'actors', 'directing', 'have', 'pretty', 'much', 'Oscar', 'staple', 'was', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'presumed', '8216', 'Inside', 'Llewyn', 'Davis', '8217', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'big', 'hit', 'received', 'unanimous', 'praise', 'festival', 'circuit', 'as', 'well', 'theatrical', 'release', 'looked', 'primed', 'Oscar', 'acceptance.And', 'then', 'received', 'Sound', 'Mixing', 'nomination', 'NOTHING', 'else.What', 'more', 'depressing', 'possibly', 'finest', 'film', '8216', 'Fargo', '8217', 'rest', 'world', 'was', 'devouring', 'output', 'was', 'reluctantly', 'holding', 'off', 'delivered', 'something', 'felt', 'tighter', 'stronger', 'more', 'vein', 'what', 'expect', 'really', '8216', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', '8217', 'wasn', '8217', 't', 'true', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'film', '8216', 'True', 'Grit', '8217', 'had', 'stronger', 'sense', 'whit', 'still', 'felt', 'muffled', 'guess', 'two', 'beloved', 'directors', 'trying', 'test', 'out', 'range', '8216', 'Serious', 'Man', '8217', 'felt', 'return', 'roots', 'true', 'form', 'yet', 'was', 'messy', 'incoherent', 'really', 'needed', 'elaboration', 'parts.', '8216', 'Inside', 'Llewyn', 'Davis', '8217', 'everything', '8216', 'Serious', 'Man', '8217', 'tried', 'be', 'more.The', 'film', 'kind', 'non-story', 'musician', 'drifting', 'life', 'bouncing', 'couch', 'couch', 'alienating', 'everyone', '8217', 's', 'well', 'not', 'very', 'nice', 'person', 'When', 'film', 'Llewis', 'smoky', 'bar', 'bellowing', 'folk', 'song', 'attention', 'instantly', 'stolen', 'propelled', 'journey', 'self-discovery', 'deeply', 'enriched', 'sounds', 'sights', 'Using', 'music', 'springboard', 'many', 'other', 'things', '8216', 'Inside', 'Llewyn', 'Davis', '8217', 'swell', 'celestial', 'sounds', 'atmospheric', 'presentation', 'one', 'Coen', '8217', 'finest', 'composite', 'films.To', 'say', '8216', 'lesser', 'Coen', '8217', 'joke.I', 'way', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'present', 'such', 'deeply', 'rooted', 'life', 'lessons', 'saccharine', 'overtures', 'dealing', 'out', 'film', 'uniquely', 'human', 'were', 'interactions', 'Llewyn', 'spiral', 'off', 'splinters', 'own', 'life', 'own', 'demons', 'were', 'present', 'universal', 'truth', 'struggle', 'create', 'perform', 'live', 'ultimately', 'conform', 'Llewyn', '8217', 'journey', 'feels', 'authentic', 'reason', 'root', 'such', 'unsavory', 'character.With', 'star', 'performances', 'all-around', 'gem', 'film', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'apart', 'scenes', 'sharp', 'biting', 'presence', 'passing', 'scene', 'John', 'Goodman', '8217', 'brief', 'appearance', 'unexpected', 'depth', 'mystery', 'plot', 'themes', 'presented', 'obviously', 'Oscar', 'Isaac', '8217', 'film', 'carry', 'boy', 'ever', 'Llewyn', 'Davis', '8217', 'attribute', 'line', 'delivery', 'laced', 'ingrown', 'sadness', 'actions', 'repulsive', 'attitude', 'star', 'performance', 'ever', 'saw', 'one', 'so', 'excited', 'see', 'where', 'here']",Inside Llewyn Davis

In terms of filmmaking alone, it is extremely well-made = with good script, realistic acting, expert singing performances, authentic emotional content.  But unfortunately, one Key element seemed to be missing!It might be a bit unfair, but a large part of my direct (not so positive) reaction to this movie was based on a somewhat admittedly 'mythologized' view/perception of the Time period/place:  early 1960's/Greenwich Village Music Scene!I grew-up in the 1970's and 80's and wasn't too familiar with the songs of Dave Van Ronk (on whom Llewyn Davis is at least partly based), but I did know a number of Tom Paxton songs ==> and many of the singer/songwriters that I admired the most (for their honesty/ poetic insight/ and melodicism) = like Bob Dylan, Paul Simon, Joni Mitchell, Jackson Browne, Carole King, Neil Young. etc, etc. were no doubt highly influenced and inspired by the early folk/rock scene depicted in this film* (even if some made their impacts a little later on). note*: of course Dylan was a direct participant!Based on the fantastic recorded/documented Music especially, but also covered in prior books and documentaries addressing roughly this same pivotal time period of the Greenwich Village folk-Music scene = the following impressions always came thru very clearly:  (1) even though it was true that many of these artists were not prospering financially, at the start of their careers ==> there still existed a great deal of authentic creative 'magic' and playful optimism 'in the air' (and great songs, of course!); (2) as well as a strong feeling of 'camaraderie' since these singer/songwriters sensed they were part of a much bigger/broader significant societal 'change' and awakening! (for example, many artists from that time & place including Dylan, Joan Baez and Phil Ochs, were heavily involved in the civil rights movement, and anti-War very early-on = representing a sort of historical 'vanguard')Both Dylan's memoir of these times 'Chronicles' and David Hajdu's book on Dylan, Joan Baez, and Mimi & Richard Farina called 'Positively 4th Street' are good sources of insight, and touch on the 'playfulness' and refreshing irreverence of that early period (and general sense of optimism in the beginning, for all the imaginative wide-ranging 'possibilities' - the cynicism came much later, when things didn't turn out as hopefully as originally 'envisioned' - but the incredible Music left behind almost makes-up for it!)Anyway, I know I'm overthinking this, and letting my own bias (and probably unrealistic 'mythological' perception of that time) influence my under-whelming view of this particular film.  But on the other hand = the incredible actual folk-Rock Music created from the period of early Sixties onward (originating with the Greenwich Village 'scene' and its highly eccentrically talented personalities) ==> in retrospect was so amazingly ground-breaking, influential and inspiring, that I wish this Coen Brothers film could have conveyed a bit more of that authentic creative 'magic'!

And of depression too, I guess. And self-loathing. And deserved failure. And...oh forget it, you don't want to know. I don't either. God, did this movie bite! You know what it was like? It was like LEBOWSKI but without much humor. Yikes.OK, so - the music. Aside from the perversely catchy and hilarious novelty song, ""Please Mr. Kennedy"",and the stunning '61 Dylan tune (""Farewell"", which, contrary to press hype, was released a few years back on Bob's famous Bootleg Series), the music here is pure sixties-folk-coffee-house-schlock-by-numbers. Originality and excitement are sorely lacking here, folks. OK, I also enjoyed the tune by the kooky Forrest-Gump-type army kid - it was beautifully performed and heartfelt. Movie should've been about him, maybe?Oh, and the cat.  Liked the cat, too.  Cats rock.And while I'm fishing for good things to say, John Goodman's pretty amusing throughout. But c'mon - when isn't big John Goodman amusing? Guy was great in spite of the fact that his character spent most of his screen time drowsing in and out of consciousness. No wonder I related to him!Alright, so back to complaints. Big, BIG problem with the filmmakers' decision to subject viewer/listeners to so many full song performances by the drearily run-of-the-mill ""Llewyn Davis"". Who could possibly want to hear this monumental toolbox sing yet another forgettable, bland, and soulless - if technically proficient - folk tune?

Don't hold your breath, Coens. OH BROTHER this aint. Heck, it isn't even ONCE. Not even close.Here's a promise, friends: you won't be able to hum the melody of a single Llewyn Davis tune after the film's over. Not a one. Nor will you even want to. Won't even occur to you. Mark my words.(deep sigh) OK...how to wrap this baby up? Ah, right! At one point in the story, the depressed, depressing, and - no exaggeration - despicable lead character screams to anyone who'll listen: ""I HATE FOLK MUSIC!"", and man did I ever believe him! Because by that point in the film, I kinda hated folk music too.Proceed with lotsa caution, movie lovers.

Ever since making their movie &#8220;O Brother, where art thou?&#8221;(2000), which featured a folk music soundtrack, they have been itching to do a film about this form of US traditional music. And they finally did it, and splendidly succeeded, with the very passionate and penetrating &#8220;Inside Llewyn Davis.&#8221;They idea behind the film was to basically recreate New York&#8217;s Greenwich Village musical scene before the arrival of Bob Dylan. For that purpose, we are transported to New York in 1961, to a place called the Gaslight Caf&eacute;, where we meet Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac), who is playing for an attentive and receptive crowd. Once he finishes the set, he is told that a guy wanted to talk to him in the alley. He goes there and the fellow beats the hell out of Llewyn, apparently for something that happened the previous night. From then on, we are taken to the recent past, where we see a very talented Llewyn trying to get a chance to show his art, singing folk songs. However, he just can&#8217;t get that evading break. You see, the man just has bad luck, as he has a pregnant ex-lover (or not?) who tells him, &#8220;Everything you touch turns to s..t,&#8221; and verbally abuses him to no end. He is also trying to find a cat that he looses while sleeping in one of his friend&#8217;s (and protector) apartment. All these situations are enough to destroy a human soul, but Llewyn keeps trying against all odds. I truly enjoyed Carey Mulligan, as the abusive ex-lover, and John Goodman, as a junkie jazz musician. And Coen Brothers found gold in Isaac, who can actually sing and act &#8211; a rarity.&#8220;Inside Llewyn Davis&#8221; doesn&#8217;t only represent the microcosm of Llewyn&#8217;s life, but also the daily existence of any struggling musician in the Greenwich Village scene during those creative years, especially during the nasty winter days. It is real and important. Justin Timberlake also plays a singer trying to make his mark. The DVD includes a very complete making-of documentary.

Inside Llewyn Davis follows a drifting folk musician who is essentially the epitome of the struggling artist. Perhaps his biggest flaw is his own integrity. The path to success is in reach, but the only way to achieve that success would be to compromise his artistic vision, and because he refuses to do so, he is lower than dirt. Oscar Isaac as the title character is spellbinding. Not only is he a fine actor but he is a serious musical talent, playing the guitar and crooning better than just about any folk singer ever. Carey Mulligan, Justin Timberlake, John Goodman, and F. Murray Abraham round out the cast of Llewyn's drearily cyclical existence. The music...oh boy, the music! Most of the film's musical numbers are performed fully live, and they are truly mesmerizing. Songs range from fun and lively to beautiful and heart-wrenching with not a rotten apple in the bunch. Not only does the film have the best soundtrack of the year, but possibly one of the best soundtracks ever. It's that good. The reason Inside Llewyn Davis doesn't have a higher rating is that its focus felt weak and the ending was not entirely satisfying. That said, The Coens obviously intended these things to show the drifting and futile life of a folk singer.

Davis is trying to find himself, and his music, after the suicide of his former partner.  He's self-centered, unaware of the effect he's having on people.  He's also uncertain what to do with the cat that's tagged along with him, or even the feline's name and gender.Oscar Isaac carries the show; he gives a nuanced, detailed performance and loses himself utterly in the role.  The supporting cast comes and goes, but each actor brings along their A-game: Justin Timberlake, Carey Mulligan, Adam Driver, John Goodman, Garrett Hedlund, and others.  The soundtrack is intoxicating, and the cinematography puts you right in Greenwich Village, circa 1961.Like all of their films, the Coen Brothers bring their own special blend of dark humor, poignant emotion, and nihilistic chaos.  The humor is flat, dry, and quick, often followed by a throwaway scene of gut-bursting emotional brutality.  Like all of their films, at times you may find INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS hard to watch.

1679130,A3C1Q9TRP83BYB,B00GMV8KGW,Daniel A. Brown,"[3, 7]","&#8220;Inside Llewyn Davis&#8221; (a reference to the title of his only, and failed, solo album) is one of those films whose anticipation falls below the actual event. I really wanted to love it, based on my respect for the Coen Brothers and my growing up in New York City&#8217;s early folk scene. My first live concert was hearing Dave Van Ronk at the Gaslight Caf&eacute; (a venue in the film) in 1964 when I was fourteen.The Gaslight is where we first meet the fictional Llewyn, crooning a ballad in the dark, smoke-tinged interior. We soon learn that whatever talent he enjoys is more than offset by his rotten personality. The guy is a true jerk, the kind of acquaintance we all have, the one who taxes our kindness but gets away with it only because we respect his gifts. Davis lives from couch to couch (he has no home, New York is one big crash pad for him) and gig to gig, borrowing money, insulting those who befriend him, and waiting for the big break. Nothing goes right for this fellow, proof that the law of karma was in operation even back in 1961. The plot follows a week of his aimless life and ends abruptly, leaving his character in an alleyway, beaten up and deflated.Right before, after concluding his gig at the Gaslight, Davis is followed on stage by some skinny kid from Minnesota with a brow of curly hair. Settled on his stool, he blows into his harp and starts strumming cords.  And so the Sixties really begin.Otherwise, the soundtrack is quite sparse. There is no grand panoramic sweep of American musical heritage made iconic in &#8220;O Brother, Where Art Thou&#8221;.  What tunes are sung, most by the actors involved, are good enough, especially a heartfelt rendition of  &#8220;500 Miles&#8221; by Justin Timberlake, Carey Mulligan and Stark Sands.  Oscar Isaac has a serviceable voice that is just right for his almost-but-not-quite-character.Visually, the tone is bleak as if all color was de-saturated in Photoshop. Even on a sunny day, New York is drab, filthy and claustrophobic. No doubt, this was intentional to match the mood of the protagonist. If so, I hope the Coens someday do a biopic on Joni Mitchell.Knowing the directors, it is not a spoiler to state that there is no happy ending here. No producer sees Davis in concert and signs him, to a million dollar contract. The movie just ends and that is apt.  For every Bob Dylan, there were dozens like Eric Anderson, Tom Paxton and Malvina Reynolds who, although highly respected in their circles, never achieved widespread fame or fortune. Folk music, itself, morphed into folk rock, disappeared for several decades only to be resurrected back into popular view as &#8220;American Roots&#8221; music by the same team of the brothers Coen and T-Bone Burnett.  For this alone, they all deserve our thanks and appreciation.",3,"A Slight Disappointment, but Worth Seeing",1388620800,"01 2, 2014",2014,2818,"['8220', 'Inside', 'Llewyn', 'Davis', '8221', 'reference', 'title', 'only', 'failed', 'solo', 'album', 'one', 'films', 'anticipation', 'actual', 'event', 'really', 'wanted', 'love', 'based', 'respect', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'growing', 'up', 'New', 'York', 'City', '8217', 'early', 'folk', 'scene', 'first', 'live', 'concert', 'was', 'hearing', 'Dave', 'Van', 'Ronk', 'Gaslight', 'Caf', 'eacute', 'venue', 'film', '1964', 'when', 'was', 'fourteen.The', 'Gaslight', 'where', 'first', 'meet', 'fictional', 'Llewyn', 'crooning', 'ballad', 'dark', 'smoke-tinged', 'interior', 'soon', 'learn', 'talent', 'more', 'offset', 'rotten', 'personality', 'guy', 'true', 'jerk', 'kind', 'acquaintance', 'have', 'one', 'who', 'taxes', 'kindness', 'away', 'only', 'respect', 'gifts', 'Davis', 'couch', 'couch', 'home', 'New', 'York', 'one', 'big', 'crash', 'pad', 'gig', 'borrowing', 'money', 'insulting', 'who', 'befriend', 'waiting', 'big', 'break', 'Nothing', 'right', 'fellow', 'proof', 'law', 'karma', 'was', 'operation', 'even', 'back', '1961', 'plot', 'week', 'aimless', 'life', 'abruptly', 'leaving', 'character', 'alleyway', 'beaten', 'up', 'deflated.Right', 'concluding', 'gig', 'Gaslight', 'Davis', 'followed', 'stage', 'skinny', 'kid', 'Minnesota', 'brow', 'curly', 'hair', 'Settled', 'stool', 'harp', 'strumming', 'cords', 'so', 'Sixties', 'really', 'begin.Otherwise', 'soundtrack', 'quite', 'sparse', 'grand', 'panoramic', 'sweep', 'American', 'musical', 'heritage', 'made', 'iconic', '8220', 'O', 'Brother', 'Where', 'Art', 'Thou', '8221', 'What', 'tunes', 'are', 'sung', 'most', 'actors', 'involved', 'are', 'good', 'enough', 'especially', 'heartfelt', 'rendition', '8220', '500', 'Miles', '8221', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'Stark', 'Sands', 'Oscar', 'Isaac', 'serviceable', 'voice', 'just', 'right', 'almost-but-not-quite-character.Visually', 'tone', 'bleak', 'color', 'was', 'de-saturated', 'Photoshop', 'Even', 'sunny', 'day', 'New', 'York', 'drab', 'filthy', 'claustrophobic', 'doubt', 'was', 'intentional', 'match', 'mood', 'protagonist', 'so', 'hope', 'Coens', 'someday', 'do', 'biopic', 'Joni', 'Mitchell.Knowing', 'directors', 'not', 'spoiler', 'state', 'happy', 'ending', 'here', 'producer', 'Davis', 'concert', 'signs', 'million', 'dollar', 'contract', 'movie', 'just', 'ends', 'apt', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'were', 'dozens', 'Eric', 'Anderson', 'Tom', 'Paxton', 'Malvina', 'Reynolds', 'who', 'highly', 'respected', 'circles', 'never', 'achieved', 'widespread', 'fame', 'fortune', 'Folk', 'music', 'morphed', 'folk', 'rock', 'disappeared', 'several', 'decades', 'only', 'be', 'resurrected', 'back', 'popular', 'view', '8220', 'American', 'Roots', '8221', 'music', 'same', 'team', 'brothers', 'Coen', 'T-Bone', 'Burnett', 'alone', 'deserve', 'thanks', 'appreciation']",Inside Llewyn Davis

1679132,A31LHED3SKLWVB,B00GMV8KGW,Darren,"[9, 13]","Oscar Isaac as &#34;Llewyn Davis&#34; is older than the other folkies in Greenwich Village 1961.  Instead of the goatee, he's got a full beard.  The hair on his head is a little longer and bushier.  He's more cynical than the others.  He has a past, an actual lived-in history, seemingly unlike the others.  Perhaps he should be singing the blues instead of folk music -- and actually, that's what he does.  F. Murray Abraham, playing Bud Grossman, tells Isaac: &#34;I'm not seeing a lot of money here.&#34;  And he's right: &#34;Llewyn Davis&#34; is too much in pain for us to want to listen to for long.  Folk musicians are too collective in their agenda to wear much individual suffering on their sleeves.  A little &#34;Llewyn&#34; goes a long way ... but in the music biz, if you start with a little, you start with nothing, and you end with nothing.  And there's your film's subject.I would tell the folk fans who, having read some of the reviews here and expecting the film to be a lightly fictionalized &#34;biopic&#34; about Dave Van Ronk, to adjust their expectations.  &#34;Llewyn&#34; shares only a tangential relationship with Van Ronk: Merchant Marine background and an even more ephemeral connection via Grossman to the Gate of Horn in Chicago.  Expect nothing so dull as a biopic from the Coens.  Instead, expect a blue study in the loneliness of artistic integrity, a subject that has interested the Coens at least since &#34;Barton Fink&#34;.  In fact, &#34;Llewyn Davis&#34; -- the character -- very much reminded me of a less-energized and more beat-down Barton.  But then, &#34;Llewyn&#34; shares traits with other Coens' anti-heroes: the outrages Isaac suffers will remind the viewer of the Dude's incredulity at a world gone mad in &#34;The Big Lebowski&#34;, for example.  Llewyn's continuing streak of bad luck in an antagonistic and even annoying world recalls Larry Gopnik's troubles from &#34;A Serious Man&#34;.  But it's really &#34;Barton Fink&#34; that is this movie's closest soulmate.  And what have the Coens learned in the 22-year gap from that older movie to this, as they revisit these themes?  Not much, for they were brilliant enough to have figured things out the first time in their youth.  The difference here is that, with the accretion of age and experience, there's less flash, less anger, less quirkiness for quirkiness' sake.  Singer Suzanne Vega, who, let me point out, was only 2 years old when the events of this film take place, criticized it for not accurately representing the folk music scene at that time in the Village, turning a &#34;vibrant, crackling, competitive, romantic, communal, crazy, drunken, brawling scene and crumpled it into a slow brown sad movie.&#34;  Maybe when they were in their 20s, the Coens would have made such a (largely fictional) movie, but even if Vega is right, this isn't a documentary.  It's about how even the saddest of losers can be heroes with integrity in their own way.  It's about how a life intensely lived has more poetry than any Bob Dylan song.  It's also about how those same heroes can make appallingly bad decisions.  It's complicated.  It's art.  It's not nostalgia.I keep referencing their earlier work, and perhaps, if one wanted to, one could pretty fairly criticize &#34;Inside Llewyn Davis&#34; for being a &#34;Best Of&#34; album, a rehash of Golden Oldies.  Yes, we get John Goodman in his trademark &#34;scary&#34; Coen Bros. role.  We get the silent cigarette-smoking guy in the car, a reprise of Peter Stormare's role in &#34;Fargo&#34;.  (A cop even pulls him over.)  We get the Object the Hero must Carry -- in &#34;Fink&#34; it was Turturro carrying a box that may or may not have contained a severed human head.  In &#34;Lebowski&#34; it was Bridges lugging around a prehistoric cellphone the size of a desktop computer.  Here, it's Oscar Isaac porting around a tabby cat, or at least a series of tabby cats.  But even the tabby is a small reprise of the wise animal from &#34;The Ladykillers&#34;.  Oh well.  You know what? -- WHATEVER.  If the Coens, after 30 years of making cinematic masterpieces, aren't allowed to revisit themes or plagiarize themselves a bit, then who the heck can?  If that's a deal-breaker, then we'd better throw out all our Hitchcock and Kurosawa DVDs while we're at it.I think Llewyn Davis is a hero of the truly existential kind.  He's like Mifune in &#34;Yojimbo&#34;, another existentialist (like all of Kurosawa's heroes).  The mistakes and bad luck aren't what define him.  What defines him is that he refuses to &#34;harmonize&#34; with his fellow folk-singers, even for the easy cash.  He refuses to wear white sweaters and get a haircut.  He refuses to shave the sides of his face and content himself with just a goatee.  And finally, he takes his beating for calling out a phony who was performing terribly on stage and whom everyone else was too polite to boo.  Some call this a study of a loser, but I saw a guy who smiled right at the end of the picture.  Indeed -- integrity has its own comfort.  There aren't enough stars for this masterpiece.

1679133,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B00GMV8KGW,David Baldwin,"[2, 5]","A folk troubadour in 1961 Greenwich Village Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac) travels the circuit strumming and warbling his offerings receiving polite applause and eking out a living with what is collected in the hat that's passed around.  Davis is no better or worse than the average performer his songs hitting the right clich&eacute;s about war and peace.  Equal parts self loathing and narcissism he is too pathetic to truly hate or love for that matter.  His music is merely passable enough to get him a different couch to sleep on every night if not relegated to the floor.  This is a daring effort by the Coens  painting a portrait of mediocrity and inviting the audience to empathize with him to some degree.  The look and feel of the film is captured meticulously by the Coens and I particularly liked the song score by T-Bone Burnett.  It's easy to write good songs but it must have been a real chore writing forgettable ones.  Davis' songs are contrasted early in the film by those of Jim(Justin Timberlake) and Jean (Carey Mulligan) and later by the master himself, Bob Dylan.  Davis may be a good craftsman but his work lacks the spark to be truly transcendent or as the record executive tells him in an audition, ""I can't sell this"".  Some of the other reviews at the Amazon site dismiss the film because the main character is unlikable.

Dylan remains among the most revered talents to come out of the Village, and a great number of people have a vivid idea of what was going on in lower Manhattan after Dylan took center stage. But it was a crowded lot before he got there, and most were carrying on the same way folkies had been doing for a number of years. Most were singing the songs people had been singing for the past 100 years and putting very little originality into it. Llewyn Davis fits the mold. The superstar from Minnesota changed all that.

1679144,A1E6JS6C205VZD,B00GMV8KGW,Dr. Laurence Raw,"[6, 12]","Set in Greenwich Village in 1961, INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS dramatizes the life of the eponymous hero (Oscar Isaac), who tries to carve out a career as a solo folk singer after his partner commits suicide.  The film vividly recreates the atmosphere of the Gaslight Cafe, a real-life venue that opened in 1958 and closed in 1971, where acts such as Bob Dylan, Bill Cosby, and Luke Faust performed.  The Caf&eacute; attracted high-profile patrons: Jimi Hendrix was known to visit one night.  Llewyn is never going to be that popular; but we have to admire his spirit as he tries his best, despite numerous obstacles placed in his way.  The 1961 setting is significant: the Coen Brothers' film recreates a significant moment in American popular culture when people broke free of their conservative shackles and began to express themselves in much more basic terms.  Politics became a legitimate subject for popular music, rather than the anodyne lyrics characteristic of many chart-topping hits of the late Fifties.  Llewyn tries his best to emphasize the significance of his songs, but no one appears to listen to him.  The film suggests that the music business was a cut-throat world, in which talent went unrecognized and agents only promoted the tried and tested, rather than the experimental.  This is brought out in a significant exchange where Llewyn travels to Chicago, only to be rebuffed by the seedy-looking Bud Grossman (F. Murray Abraham).  The film is full of significant moments and quirky casting: I particularly admired the casting of Justin Timberlake as Jim, another would-be folk musician who tries to change his name to guarantee success, but ends up on the musical scrapheap, just like Llewyn.  Deliberately shot in low-key color, INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS befits repeated viewings, in order to make sense of its multi-leveled structure.

Now, the Cohanim (plural of Cohen) are the priestly family of the Jewish people, members of the Tribe of Levi.The books of Exodus and Leviticus describe the responsibilities of the Cohanim, which include the Temple service and blessing of the people. What I think the Coen Bro's are up to? Well, anyone can see that they have an acutely sardonic sense of humor. So--Comparing the career of Llewyn Davis and Bob Dylan, are there any New Testament parables that spring to mind? Well, at the beginning of the film, we see Llewyn Davis cast into the outer darkness, where he is left weeping and gnashing his teeth, and at the end of the film we see the arrival, in the Gaslight Cafe, of the Anointed One (singing ""Fare thee well"" to the Old Folk Laws)--(before we see Llewyn left gnashing his teeth, again). A sower obviously went forth sowing seed, and some fell on barren ground and yielded naught, and some on fertile ground and yielded one hundred fold. And there is another example, consider the judgments that Llewyn passes against his fellow artists--(""4 Micks and Grandma Moses""), and the somewhat absolute judgement rendered upon him by Bud Grossman. Judge not, indeed. And certainly, peace was not brung, but a sword instead, for the members of his household, i.e. his sister, became his enemy, and even the friends that fed him and sheltered him endured his wrath. He sure did kick the dust from his heels when he fled the Village to seek the Gate of Horn. No pearls before swine for him. Just ask the Gorfeins.But, other than the shoehorning of the Greenwich folk scene into Biblical fables, there is no story structure, no plot, no picaresque. Just a sequence of set pieces and performances. The set pieces are largely lifted from Dave Van Ronk's biography, but Dave Van Ronk was a charming and entertaining performer, well loved by everyone who knew him, and far far from the obnoxious, socially toxic loser portrayed by Llewyn Davis. And--What is up with Ulysses the cat? And--Why does Jean hate Llewyn so? Well, that becomes obvious as the story unfolds, but these questions are all connected by the most desultory scenarios.Then there are the performances. Troy Nelson's rendition of Tom Paxton's That was the Last Thing on My Mind was truly moving, and 500 Miles, was sweetly done. But Llewyn Davis seems somewhat oddly out of place among this milieu-he's too polished, he tries to hard, he doesn't seem to be having any fun. I can see why Bud Grossman stated he could see no money there, and why he should seek a partner, just as I could understand his claim that Troy Nelson had a special gift for connecting with audiences. But the whole point of the film is that many are called but few are chosen. In Greek mythology, mortals displaying Hubris offended the Gods. Hubris is sometimes characterized as pompous inflation, but the Greeks regarded it as an expression of irreverence. Llewyn Davis can gnash his teeth and wail all he wants. He had an invitation to the wedding, and he showed up without a wedding garment. If he truly knew his folk traditions, he would have known how the rest of the story goes. The deepest irony of the story is revealed at the moment when Llewyn is getting smacked down in an alley--and in that moment, Dylan is getting discovered by a critic from the NY Times who would go on to write a positive review of Dylan's performance. Llewyn, with his honey'd voice and proficient finger picking, is the anti-Dylan. The Coen's go a long long way to encourage you to look closely not at Llewyn, but at Dylan, and wonder at the sheer mystery of the magnitude of his artistic achievement. Llewyn, BTW is Welsh for 'shining leader' and Dylan is Welsh for 'son of the sea'. There is a strange inverted harmony in that fact.I've always appreciated Dave Van Ronk, but there is a story in Chonicles 1 that sheds a little light. When Dylan began working with John Hammond, around the time of his first album, Hammond was getting ready to re-release the original recordings of Robert Johnson on Columbia, and he gave Dylan a sample of the LP in a white generic sleeve. The album had not been released yet. And he rushed over to Dave Van Ronk's place to listen to it with him. Van Ronk was like a mentor and and older brother. And Van Ronk listened, and proceeded to identify, itemize, and list every influence on each song, how he clearly got this element from this prior artist, and this element from that blues influence, the way an entomologist would dissect a newly discovered insect. But what Dylan heard was this--the power of Johnson to impact his audience, and Dylan wanted that too--the ability to connect with, and move, the listener. Van Ronk wanted to build a Taxonomic tree, but Dylan wanted to capture lightning. And there, in a nutshell, is the difference between adherence and innovation, between the study of history, and the making of history. Between the seismograph, and the lightning rod.",3,Rabbinical Teaching Moment,1390003200,"01 18, 2014",2014,5020,"['end', 'credits', 'image', 'declaring', 'film', 'Kosher', 'Passover', 'Now',

Inside Llewyn Davis takes us inside the life of a struggling artist, and it isn't pretty. The film reminds us that for every Bob Dylan who makes it big, there is a world full of Llewyn Davis's who despite talent, passion and effort, can't seem to catch a break and gives up on their dreams.Llewyn is a folk singer who is clearly a talented artist.  We know this from the opening scene where he gives a moving performance that is warmly received by a cafe audience.  His heart is in the right place; he means well and tries to do the right thing.  And yet the universe seems to conspire against him.  The gatekeepers of the music business are blind to his talent and interested only in money.  The people he trusts betray him.  The people he needs are disinterested or unavailable.  No one seems to understand him.  And anything that can go wrong in his life does.Llewyn tries to deal with the adversity, but as things go wrong for him, and as he confronts the reality of how much of his soul he would have to sell to succeed, his bitterness and resentment build, and it seems he can't help but alienate and anger those close to him and those who could help him. And so he sinks into an angry, self-sabotaging cycle.  It's painful to watch.  In the end, he is literally beaten down.So why make a film about a failing artist who catches every bad break and seems to make things worse for himself?  Because it is a Coen brothers film.  The scenes are gritty but hauntingly beautiful.  The characters are finely drawn and larger than life.  And the dialogue and performances are pitch perfect.  In short, expect to be moved, if not inspired.The storyline makes a point to show us how close Llewyn is to breaking out.  The tantalizing prospect of success hovers throughout the film.  He could have had big royalties from his performance in a hit song; he could have been part of Peter, Paul & Mary; he could have been discovered like Dylan. But somehow he is always in the wrong place at the wrong time making the wrong choice.  It makes his self-sabotaging character feel that much more tragic.Don't expect a happy ending.  In fact, the film ends as it began, which I suppose is the filmmaker's device of showing us the talented artist going nowhere and getting beaten down by the struggle.  But at least we are all better off for having gone along for the ride.",4,Moving Portrait of the Struggling Artist,1391472000,"02 4, 2014",2014,2428,"[""'re"", 'accustomed', 'seeing', 'super-fortunate', 'lives', 'celebrities', 'Inside', 'Llewyn', 'Davis', 'life', 'struggling', 'artist', ""n't"", 'pretty', 'film', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'who', 'big', 'world', 'full', 'Llewyn', 'Davis', 'who', 'talent', 'passion', 'effort', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'catch', 'break', 'up', 'dreams.Llewyn', 'folk', 'singer', 'who', 'clearly', 'talented', 'artist', 'know', 'opening', 'scene', 'where', 'moving', 'performance', 'warmly', 'received', 'cafe', 'audience', 'heart', 'right', 'place', 'well', 'tries', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'yet', 'universe', 'conspire', 'gatekeepers', 'music', 'business', 'are', 'talent', 'interested', 'only', 'money', 'people', 'betray', 'people', 'are', 'disinterested', 'unavailable', 'one', 'understand', 'anything', 'can', 'go', 'wrong', 'life', 'does.Llewyn', 'tries', 'deal', 'adversity', 'things', 'go', 'wrong', 'reality', 'how', 'much', 'soul', 'would', 'have', 'sell', 'succeed', 'bitterness', 'resentment', 'build', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'alienate', 'anger', 'close', 'who', 'could', 'help', 'so', 'angry', 'self-sabotaging', 'cycle', 'painful', 'watch', 'end', 'literally', 'beaten', 'down.So', 'why', 'make', 'film', 'failing', 'artist', 'who', 'bad', 'break', 'make', 'things', 'worse', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'film', 'scenes', 'are', 'gritty', 'hauntingly', 'beautiful', 'characters', 'are', 'finely', 'drawn', 'larger', 'life', 'dialogue', 'performances', 'are', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'short', 'expect', 'be', 'moved', 'not', 'inspired.The', 'storyline', 'point', 'show', 'how', 'close', 'Llewyn', 'breaking', 'out', 'tantalizing', 'prospect', 'success', 'hovers', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'big', 'royalties', 'performance', 'hit', 'song', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'part', 'Peter', 'Paul', 'Mary', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'discovered', 'Dylan', 'somehow', 'always', 'wrong', 'place', 'wrong', 'time', 'making', 'wrong', 'choice', 'self-sabotaging', 'character', 'feel', 'much', 'more', 'tragic.Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'happy', 'ending', 'fact', 'film', 'began', 'suppose', 'filmmaker', 'device', 'showing', 'talented', 'artist', 'going', 'nowhere', 'getting', 'beaten', 'down', 'struggle', 'least', 'are', 'better', 'off', 'having', 'gone', 'ride']",Inside Llewyn Davis

1679150,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00GMV8KGW,FNDNreview,"[2, 5]","If you&#8217;re looking for an example of a powerful performance that will launch an actor into stardom &#8211; or at least get him some substantial roles going forward, search no further than Oscar Isaac&#8217;s distinguished portrayal in the 1960s period comedy-drama, Inside Llewyn Davis.Directed by Joel and Ethan Coen (Fargo, No County for Old Men), Inside Llewyn Davis stars Oscar Isaac as struggling folk singer, Llewyn Davis.  It&#8217;s the winter of 1961 and the film begins with a melancholy musical solo by Davis in a somewhat famous New York coffee house, called the Gaslight Caf&eacute;.  Shortly after the conclusion of the performance, Llewyn receives word from the club&#8217;s owner, Pappi (Max Casella), that there&#8217;s a man in the alley waiting to speak with him.  The mysterious man, unrecognizable to Llewyn, proceeds to physically assault him &#8211; and thus sets the stage for Llewyn&#8217;s current down-but-not-out state of living.The next scene shifts to morning time where Llewyn awaken in a friend&#8217;s apartment.  He leaves and heads out to see his other friend, Jim (Justin Timberlake).  Unfortunately, Jim isn&#8217;t home &#8211; but his girlfriend, Jean (Carey Mulligan), is, and she wastes little time informing Llewyn that she&#8217;s pregnant (presumably with his child).  Clearly angered, Jean eventually tells Llewyn that she has no intention of keeping the baby &#8211; since there&#8217;s a chance it could be his.  Planning to have an abortion, she tells Llewyn it&#8217;s his responsibility that it&#8217;s his responsibility to come up with the money &#8211; even though he&#8217;s broke.Once again, the news about Jean&#8217;s pregnancy continues with the general theme of Llewyn&#8217;s life.  At one point, he was well on his way with his music &#8211; making a successful hit, If I Had Wings, with his musical partner, Mike.  However, Mike is no longer around and Llewyn is hard-pressed to sell himself as a solo act, especially since he only plays folk music.  He takes gigs from time to time, at least when Jim is able to help him, but he makes mistakes, like signing a contract for a one time cash deal and waives potential royalties (if the song becomes a hit).Many people clearly love Llewyn, while other find him to be a massive disappointment to others &#8211; yet he is accused of holding himself back from hitting it big.  Tired of criticism, he sets out for Chicago, sharing a car with a jazz musician, Roland Turner (John Goodman) and the driver/poet, Johnny Five (Garrett Hedlund).  Once in Chicago, his mission is to play for an influential club owner, Bud Grossman (F. Murray Abraham).  And, what this man says to Llewyn might just dictate the future of his musical career.There&#8217;s a lot to love and a lot to hate about this particular picture.  For starters, Oscar Issac gives a tremendous performance as Llewyn Davis.  He not only nails the role, but he also does all of his own singing &#8211; and let me tell you, his voice alone is worth the price of admission.  Sadly, his character has very little to look forward to, constantly struggling to find his way in the world.  Not only does he have struggles with his new solo career, but he also struggles to find a place to sleep each and every night.  Without a doubt, he&#8217;s doing his best to face down depression.Even despite the constant dejected tone (which never dissipates), Isaac has plenty of memorable scenes, the best and most memorable of which include John Goodman, plus the performances of Justin Timberlake.  Now, all of the Justin fans out there should be warned that he&#8217;s only in this film for a handful of scenes, so if that&#8217;s your selling point, you might want to rethink your decision to sit through the film.  Still, the song that has received the most attention is the performance of &#8220;Please Mr. Kennedy.&#8221;  Does this song ever sound way, way outdated and almost laughable &#8211; at first, but just give it a few moments to let it fully sink in.  As the song progresses, it really does become an eye-opener, fitting into the story perfectly.  In fact, I wonder how many takes it took for them to get it right&#8230;The major downside of the film is the fore-mentioned state of constant melancholy.  Most will assume that a plot that constantly hammers away at Llewyn&#8217;s character is all leading up to his &#8220;big break&#8221; &#8211; translating into a moving, uplifting moment that would likely take place in the climax.  However, that&#8217;s not the type of story this is, nor is it traditional by any other means.  Certainly, this film is fresh, dramatic, and commendable &#8211; but like many of the Coen brothers&#8217; pictures, this one progresses with a real-life mentality.  To that end, failure is a major possibility, which leaves viewers stuck with an ending that will not only leave a bad taste, but also largely disappoint.Overall, Inside Llewyn Davis (named after the character&#8217;s solo album) is a fresh, yet ultimately random film.  It follows a character that&#8217;s struggling to get by, never pulling its life blows along the way.  There are scenes full of wonderful music, brief snippets of comedy, and finally, scenes that make you wish you could just help this character find his way in the world.  For lovers of the Coen brothers, this film will likely appease your demands, although it doesn&#8217;t necessarily stand out when compared to their other films, like The Big Lebowski or No Country for Old Men.  Also, on a side note &#8211; there&#8217;s plenty of folk music in this flick to be sure, with some songs being better than others.GRADE:  CFNDNreview.com",3,Coen brothers sing more blues than folk in

Spoilers.""Inside Llewyn Davis"" begins and ends with a pair of scenes so similar that for a moment at the end, we think ninety-nine percent of the movie might have been a flashback. But internal evidence makes this impossible. The life of Llewyn (Oscar Isaac, in the performance of a career) is merely a cycle.Llewyn is a folk singer in 1961 Greenwich Village. He screws up almost everything. Almost. He lives in other people's homes. He values least the people who treat him best. His friend Jim (Justin Timberlake) lives in blissful ignorance with a woman, Jean (Carey Mulligan), who is pregnant, possibly by Llewyn. (Llewyn's relationship with Jean is a model of dysfunction; their deception of Jim is the least of what's wrong with them as a pair.) Llewyn has an alternative career in the Merchant Marine, but he does not do the minimum to keep it as a source of money when he needs it. He is jealous, and he heckles his usual nightclub's new talent, doing no one any good. He appoints himself, after several twists of fate, or, rather, twists of incompetence, to be the guardian of someone else's pet--a project in which he fully plays out for us his unfortunate personality.But he's always on time, even early, for the gig. He always fumbles all the way to the finish line. He will do whatever he must to make that session, or that audition. His heart is in his singing career.Llewyn's performances are earnest and tuneful, but workmanlike. He could make a living as a studio musician, or in an act with the right partner or partners. But he feels he must go it alone. He won't succeed, because he's nothing special. He does not have a heart-stopping voice like the young Joan Baez, or natural showmanship like the young Bob Dylan, who are just about to come to notice. Llewyn is a drone.Llewyn had a partner, Mike, who killed himself. So powerful is Llewyn's talent for screwing up that it really wouldn't surprise us to learn that Llewyn managed to bungle Mike into it, possibly by impregnating Mike's woman. Jean certainly blames Llewyn for Mike's death. After savagely insulting Llewyn, she explains by saying, ""I miss Mike."" And Llewyn can't bear now to sing duets; his conscience bothers him.The movie has wonderful performances by John Goodman and Garrett Hedlund as Roland and Johnny, a pair of strangers who meet Llewyn when they pick him up in a mutual friend's car for a ride to an audition in Chicago. Roland is narrow-minded, pompous, and belligerent to a puzzling degree, a probable taste of what the inflexible Llewyn will become, especially if he ever feels anything like the crippled Roland's physical pain. Roland rants a lot, sleeps a lot, and has a habit of staring with glazed eyes at the ceiling and stopping at restrooms, where he stays for a mysteriously long time. He calls the homosexual Johnny his valet, which at first seems to be a joke. But Johnny attends to Roland as efficiently as Mervyn Bunter ever attended to Lord Peter Wimsey, with an apparent sense of commitment. Roland proves to be a heroin addict, which explains a good deal, and he is probably past any sexual activity; furthermore, he calls homosexuals ""queers."" But Johnny clearly plans to honor his own commitment to the end. A police officer approaches the car while an extremely hopped-up Roland is lolling in the back seat. There is no telling what might have happened had Llewyn been in the driver's seat, but Johnny picks a fight with the cop so promptly and efficiently that he gets himself taken to the police station, keeping the cop's attention off Roland. Johnny wisely takes the car keys with him, and Llewyn has to get out and hitchhike the rest of the way to Chicago, where a club owner and agent (F. Murray Abraham) bursts, or rather, temporarily dents, his bubble.Llewyn hitches back to the east coast with another stranger, doing all the driving for the car's sleepy owner. He considers a detour into Akron to look up an old lover, the mother of his unknown two-year-old child. (The movie has several sly references to unknown or unborn children.) Llewyn feels a pull toward his child, although he mocks Jean's dreams of a conventional life. But he has a shocking experience outside Akron that reminds him of what a piece of blundering bad luck he is, and he hits the road without jinxing his old lover and their child with a visit. He then bungles his way through Manhattan, where he blunders into the final scene.One thing I like about the Coen Brothers is the way their films all seem to be patches in the same quilt, as with Alfred Hitchcock. There are characters in this movie named Ulysses, Jean, and Grossman. (Surely we've heard of them before.) And the Coen Brothers continue to tap the ""loner-loser"" tambourine, making a statement about the pointlessness of life. The unanswered questions are tantalizing. At one point during the drive to Chicago, the usually silent Johnny complains about a successful show that could have run longer, but ""the cops closed it."" Llewyn asks why. ""Long story,"" says Johnny. No doubt. I can think of possibilities. (Was the show obscene? Did Roland OD on stage? Was Johnny turning tricks in the men's room to support Roland's habit? Nah. Too predictable, too banal. You're in Coen country. Perhaps it will make another script.)",5,"Inside Llewyn Davis. Deep script, great performances.

Lane ""professional audience member""","[1, 5]","The Coen brothers are geniuses (genii?) who knew there was a movie star lurking out there, tragically overlooked. Their Oscar-winning music arranger T-Bone Burnett (""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"") was a sure-fire gold-plated winner. With numerous nominations and wins for this film at festivals in Europe, and the Gran Prix (Audience Award) at Cannes under their belt, it was time to bring this baby home. And what have they done with all this bounty? They consigned Garrett Hedlund to a bit part as a chain-smoking driver! I was soooo looking forward to hearing this gifted guy sing again. To me, HE is the star tragically overlooked. Aarghhh!The story is a week in the life of a folk singer striving for a breakthrough in 1961 Greenwich Village, at a time when folk singing arguably is in decline.The cast:* Oscar Isaac (""Won't Back Down"") is the Coen brothers ""discovery."" This fellow has worked third-tier roles for years. If he is just learning to sing and play guitar, why learn to do it with his eyes closed? I find it annoying!* Carey Mulligan (""Never Let Me Go"") is the lovely singer everyone wants (and gets!).* John Goodman (""Trouble With the Curve"") is a jazz musician who derides folk music while nurturing his own demons.* Garrett Hedlund (""Country Strong"") is totally, utterly wasted here. There must be more to this choice than I have seen. This talented singer/actor could easily have replaced any of the other singers in this cast!* Justin Timberlake (""Runner Runner"") is here for two songs and does them well. If only the rest of the film had such entertaining music.* Stark Sands (Lots of TV) impressed me with his sweet ingenuous character. A Tony-nominated performer (""Kinky Boots"" and ""Journey's End""), he has been in musicals since high school.This R-rated drama/musical has lots of profanity, discussions about abortions, adult language and an irritating ""hero"" who is adrift. T-Bone Burnett mounts the music with his usual verve and uncanny ear, but... sigh.... I hesitate to disclose what little story there is, because anything I say would be a spoiler.Oh well, the 60s are nicely re-imagined: the vintage cars, the S&H; Green Stamps, the clothes and the furniture.

What on earth are they praising?Yes, we all love the Coen brothers--but this one is weak. Maybe it's because it's about the folk music scene of the early 60's. But the problem was not so much the 'scene' but the boring as hell portrayal of it. The dullest acoustic, ""folk"" music I have ever heard. Peter Paul & Mary were astoundingly good--and their music was gorgeous. This stuff was plain-as-mud dull. This was the big issue for me. But I loved the cat. Actually, that was what I liked best. But the girlfriend, played by the brilliant, Carey Mulligan, was so hostile and cruel, I felt the main character was a total wuss to put up with her. Then there's his sister, another bitter, unlikeable woman.The professor, however, was a bright spot, but the main character's tantrums made it too hard for me to care about him as well.

While there are a few good jokes peppered throughout the film, the story is a mostly bleak tale of a loser musician and his bumbling misadventures. Told as a more experimental or natural piece, there is no overarching story or big struggle, simply a series of episodes in the man's life.While some may appreciate the avant-garde novelty of the work, I think fans of the Coens will be disappointed by the simplicity of the film, as it lacks their trademark style like inventive camera work, snappy editing and zippy dialog. Their normally lush cinematography looks too washed out and muted here. But the film does have a beautiful and elegant soundtrack of contemplative folk songs.It does not really help the experience that the protagonist is a jerk.

1679181,A3MTULATO06OS5,B00GMV8KGW,"Lady Fancifull ""Tinkerbell""","[1, 4]","This Coen Brothers film, about the burgeoning folk scene in the early 60s had me wincing, laughing, and absorbed for its 90 minutes. The film opens in Greenwich Village in 1961 at a precise time just BEFORE Dylan burst onto the scene.Llewyn Davis (an excellent performance by Oscar Isaac) is an utterly self-obsessed, careless, narcissistic musician. He is however a man of talent, self-belief, and creativity. And also laziness, prickliness and melancholy.So the nub of the film is the self-obsession and belief which the artist MUST have, if they are to be putting their creative vision out there &#8211; married with the fact that the person themselves may not be particularly likeable. We (the consuming public) half forgive the often careless and badly behaved artist if their WORK touches us.The Coens present us with this &#8211; in many ways Davis is a rather unlikeable human being, careless of everyone else&#8217;s feelings, tender of his own. At yet, there is a curious vulnerability about him which is attractive enough to allow him to use people, because they see something in that vulnerability which they want to protect, not to mention a sense that what the artist creates may be much finer than the artist himself. So, as that fineness of creation is IN the artist, this means they must, surely, be a better person than they appear to be. Well, that I think is the theory that has artists forgiven for what would be unindulged  behaviour in non-artists.Maybe we do believe, unlike what Orwell says, that an artist IS a special kind of man!Davis stumbles through, journeying from New York to Chicago and back, in pursuit of fame and fortune, insulting people wittingly and unwittingly, coercing his way into places to stay, meals to be fed &#8211; and making at one point a terribly wrong decision around a recording session which the audience knows will sting. Davis is careless and selfish, sure, but he is also gauche and possessed of a certain gullible innocence &#8211; he both exploits and IS exploited.I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m not alone is also rooting for the parallel ginger cat story, one of those wonderfully real Coenesque eccentricities,  which left me, as a cat fancier,  wondering and worrying about one development. (can&#8217;t say more, spoiler avoider)Llewyn Davis&#8217; has a Dylanesque musical style and voice, and indeed Oscar Isaac has some of that intense street-waif sexiness of the young Dylan, as in the album cover of the Freewheelin&#8217; Bob Dylan, and there is almost a sub-text of &#8216;could this be a version of Dylan&#8217;. There is a neat barbed moment around this in the film, which had me wincing and laughing in equal measure.With a great musical trawl through, in terms of live performance and soundtrack music, this was a thoroughly enjoyable filmOther performances of note in the film are the sweet faced, sweet voiced, foul mouthed and angry character played by Carey Mulligan, John Goodman as a fairly obnoxious jazz musician and Garrett Hedlund as Johnny Five, a beat poet, in the road/Chicago section of the film.The 40 odd minute &#8216;extras&#8217; have a certain rough-cut charm, probably particularly to musicians.I have one  small criticism of the sound quality of the spoken material, which seemed unusually quiet and muttery from some of the performers, so I had to have the volume turned up beyond normal levels to properly hear much of the dialogue.I received the DVD as a review copy from Amazon Vine UK",4,"Uncomfortable, hilarious, poignant and musical is the brew",1396569600,"04 4, 2014",2014,3481,"['Coen', 'Brothers', 'film', 'burgeoning', 'folk', 'scene', 'early', '60s', 'had', 'wincing', 'laughing', 'absorbed', '90', 'minutes', 'film', 'Greenwich', 'Village', '1961', 'precise', 'time', 'just', 'BEFORE', 'Dylan', 'burst', 'scene.Llewyn', 'Davis', 'excellent', 'performance', 'Oscar', 'Isaac', 'utterly', 'self-obsessed', 'careless', 'narcissistic', 'musician', 'however', 'man', 'talent', 'self-belief', 'creativity', 'also', 'laziness', 'prickliness', 'melancholy.So', 'nub', 'film', 'self-obsession', 'belief', 'artist', 'MUST', 'have', 'are', 'be', 'putting', 'creative', 'vision', 'there', '8211', 'married', 'fact', 'person', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'particularly', 'likeable', 'consuming', 'public', 'half', 'forgive', 'often', 'careless', 'badly', 'behaved', 'artist', 'WORK', 'touches', 'us.The', 'Coens', 'present', '8211', 'many', 'ways', 'Davis', 'rather', 'unlikeable', 'human', 'being', 'careless', 'everyone', 'else', '8217', 's', 'feelings', 'tender', 'own', 'yet', 'curious', 'vulnerability', 'attractive', 'enough', 'allow', 'use', 'people', 'see', 'something', 'vulnerability', 'want', 'protect', 'not', 'mention', 'sense', 'what', 'artist', 'may', 'be', 'much', 'finer', 'artist', 'So', 'fineness', 'creation', 'IN', 'artist', 'must', 'surely', 'be', 'better', 'person', 'appear', 'be', 'Well', 'think', 'theory', 'artists', 'forgiven', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'unindulged', 'behaviour', 'non-artists.Maybe', 'do', 'believe', 'what', 'Orwell', 'artist', 'special', 'kind', 'man', 'Davis', 'journeying', 'New', 'York', 'Chicago', 'back', 'pursuit', 'fame', 'fortune', 'insulting', 'people', 'wittingly', 'unwittingly', 'coercing', 'way', 'places', 'stay', 'meals', 'be', 'fed', '8211', 'making', 'one', 'point', 'terribly', 'wrong', 'decision', 'recording', 'session', 'audience', 'knows', 'will', 'sting', 'Davis', 'careless', 'selfish', 'sure', 'also', 'gauche', 'possessed', 'certain', 'gullible', 'innocence', '8211', 'exploits', 'IS', 'exploited.I', '8217', 'm', 'sure', '8217', 'not', 'alone', 'also', 'rooting', 'parallel', 'ginger', 'cat', 'story', 'one', 'wonderfully', 'real', 'Coenesque', 'eccentricities', 'left', 'cat', 'fancier', 'wondering', 'worrying', 'one', 'development', 'can', '8217', 't', 'say', 'more', 'spoiler', 'avoider', 'Llewyn', 'Davis', '8217', 'Dylanesque', 'musical', 'style', 'voice', 'indeed', 'Oscar', 'Isaac', 'intense', 'street-waif', 'sexiness', 'young', 'Dylan', 'album', 'cover', 'Freewheelin', '8217', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'almost', 'sub-text', '8216', 'could', 'be', 'version', 'Dylan', '8217', 'neat', 'barbed', 'moment', 'film', 'had', 'wincing', 'laughing', 'equal', 'measure.With', 'great', 'musical', 'trawl', 'terms', 'live', 'performance', 'soundtrack', 'music', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'filmOther', 'performances', 'note', 'film', 'are', 'sweet', 'faced', 'sweet', 'voiced', 'foul', 'mouthed', 'angry', 'character', 'played', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'John', 'Goodman', 'fairly', 'obnoxious', 'jazz', 'musician', 'Garrett', 'Hedlund', 'Johnny', 'Five', 'beat', 'poet', 'road/Chicago', 'section', 'film.The', '40', 'minute', '8216', '8217', 'have', 'certain', 'rough-cut', 'charm', 'probably', 'particularly', 'musicians.I', 'have', 'one', 'small', 'criticism', 'sound', 'quality', 'spoken', 'material', 'seemed', 'unusually', 'quiet', 'muttery', 'performers', 'had', 'have', 'volume', 'turned', 'up', 'normal', 'levels', 'properly', 'hear', 'much', 'dialogue.I', 'received', 'DVD', 'review', 'copy', 'Amazon', 'Vine', 'UK']",Inside Llewyn Davis
1679182,A1OZAYRJQAERTK,B00GMV8KGW,Larry Benjamin,"[0, 5]","It's hard to believe that the same people who created masterpieces like &#34;Raising Arizona,&#34; &#34;Fargo,&#34; &#34;The Big Lebowski,&#34; &#34;A Serious Man,&#34; and many others, were responsible for this depressing mess. The film opens with the lead character giving a mediocre performance of a marginal folk tune, then getting beaten up for no apparent reason. Unlike other Coen Brothers films, we are not immediately drawn into an interesting world, and make no connection to the protagonist. Think of the opening of &#34;Fargo,&#34; with the ominous music and the sudden appearance of what looks like a monster, the shock of the first few scenes of &#34;No Country for Old Men,&#34; or Sam Elliott's rambling, yet fascinating introduction to &#34;The Big Lebowski.&#34;The film is shot in a depressing, muted palette of blue-gray, corresponding to the lead character's depressing life. A marginally talented, annoying jerk, he misses connections with the other people in his life just as he misses opportunities to succeed in music. The ending offers no catharsis - just as the folk music scene is about to take off, Davis will no longer be part of it.The Coen Brothers are entitled to make a few duds - I never saw the point of &#34;Barton Fink&#34; outside the irony of a blocked writer unaware of the fount of inspiration his neighbor could provide, and &#34;Intolerable Cruelty&#34; was forgettable despite a few great lines (&#34;the Massey pre-nup has never been penetrated!&#34;). But &#34;Inside Llewyn Davis&#34; is their only film that I would have to call abysmally, unredeemably awful. The Coens proved that they have an ear for music with &#34;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&#34;, but despite the potentially great material available from the era the film is supposed to take place in, the soundtrack is nothing special. The stupefying performance of &#34;The Auld Triangle&#34; even leaves out the final verse:In the female prison there are seventy womenand I wish to God it was with them that I did dwellAs always, John Goodman's performance, this time as a mysterious traveler, steals the scenes he is in.

1679187,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00GMV8KGW,Mark Turner,"[2, 3]","There was a time when a movie released by the Coen Brothers was cause for celebration. Fans flocked to theaters to watch their movies and they could do no wrong. But for some reason their latest film gathered little attention from critics and fans alike. Which is sad because INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS actually quite a good film.Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac) is a folk singer on the verge of stardom. Still playing the Greenwich Village circuit for low pay with an album that's not selling at all, Llewyn goes from friend to friend, sleeping on any couch that is offered and trying to remain the creative artist that he is. We're given glimpses into a past that involved a partner but no clue where he is now.The folk scene is still hip in 1961 New York with people still flocking to the local clubs to hear the latest music. But Llewyn is disappointed in the music he hears now. It's not the soulful music rooted deep in not just the early folk music that was there but in blues as well. The current crop of performers, including his friends Jean and Jim (Carey Mulligan and Justin Timberlake), are talented sure but they lack that certain something he feels will prove their worth. In the meantime they're a hit with club patrons and Jim is recording a new album at Columbia.Looking for work, Llewyn goes from place to place seeking help from his friends and colleagues. At the same time he refuses to break down and forego the life of a performer, working the day to day menial jobs like his father before him. Having once been a merchant marine, he no longer wants to return to that life. And so he moves forward in the hopes of creating music and getting that lucky break.But as the movie slowly unrolls we get a glimpse into the real world that Llewyn live in. Jean is pregnant and unsure if the child is his or Jim's and thus wants an abortion just in case. Her resentment of Llewyn putting her into this position is tinged not with guilt so much as anger since she wants children with Jim. Llewyn's agent always collects his fee but rarely ever seems to do much for his clients. And Llewyn's sister just wants him to make something of himself. All of them push hard at Llewyn with no sympathetic ear to offer him.Word reaches Llewyn of one of Jim's friends making a trek to Chicago to meet with Bud Grossman (F. Murray Abraham), the owner of the biggest folk club and producer of many who have made it in the field. We move from Llewyn trying to find his way in New York to his finding a ride with a quiet driver for an eccentric named Roland Turner (John Goodman). Cajoled and insulted by Roland, Llewyn stays with the duo as long as he can. The meeting with Grossman could change everything.There are two movies at work here in this film. The most obvious is the quest of Llewyn Davis to find vindication in his work, in his art. He wants to be loved not in the form of a paycheck but in the form of adoration while at the same time holding himself above all of that. At the same time we're given a history of folk music of that time period. The early sixties was a transitional period for folk music, moving from the classic standards of the past to a more personal and youthful sound that was moved forward by Bob Dylan. This film takes place right in the middle of that change.More than any other Coen film, this movie relies heavily on the music found here. I watching the extras you learn that each person involved played their own music and most were recorded straight through as they performed. To think that these actors could not only act the scene but perform the music as well says much to the authenticity they bring to each character.The story that we're made privy to here is a sad one in some ways but with a glimmer of hope shining through at the end. And yet we have no idea when it's all over just what will become of Llewyn and that's how it should be. This is no cardboard cutout look at the music world where all things happen in 90 minutes, crisis stated and solution found. This is the world of an artist who is still seeking that elusive muse that will allow him to be discovered by the world.The Coen Brothers have done it once again. They've transported us to another place in time, a world that we might have heard of but most have never experienced. And in so doing they expose us to some well played music and some incredible actors who appear to be the characters they're portraying rather than acting. In so doing we're given a movie that entertains both visually and aurally. It's a movie that's worth watching and perhaps even adding to the collection.",5,THE TIMES THEY WERE A CHANGIN',1400630400,"05 21, 2014",2014,4586,"['was', 'time', 'when', 'movie', 'released', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'was', 'cause', 'celebration', 'Fans', 'flocked', 'theaters', 'watch', 'movies', 'could', 'do', 'wrong', 'reason', 'latest', 'film', 'gathered', 'little', 'attention', 'critics', 'fans', 'alike', 'Which', 'sad', 'INSIDE', 'LLEWYN', 'DAVIS', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'film.Llewyn', 'Davis', 'Oscar', 'Isaac', 'folk', 'singer', 'verge', 'stardom', 'Still', 'playing', 'Greenwich', 'Village', 'circuit', 'low', 'pay', 'album', 'not', 'selling', 'Llewyn', 'friend', 'friend', 'sleeping', 'couch', 'offered', 'trying', 'remain', 'creative', 'artist', ""'re"", 'given', 'glimpses', 'past', 'involved', 'partner', 'clue', 'where', 'now.The', 'folk', 'scene', 'still', 'hip', '1961', 'New', 'York', 'people', 'still', 'flocking', 'local', 'clubs', 'hear', 'latest', 'music', 'Llewyn', 'disappointed', 'music', 'now', 'not', 'soulful', 'music', 'rooted', 'deep', 'not', 'just', 'early', 'folk', 'music', 'was', 'there', 'blues', 'well', 'current', 'crop', 'performers', 'including', 'friends', 'Jean', 'Jim', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', 'are', 'talented', 'sure', 'lack', 'certain', 'something', 'will', 'prove', 'worth', 'meantime', ""'re"", 'hit', 'club', 'patrons', 'Jim', 'recording', 'new', 'album', 'Columbia.Looking', 'work', 'Llewyn', 'place', 'place', 'seeking', 'help', 'friends', 'colleagues', 'same', 'time', 'break', 'down', 'forego', 'life', 'performer', 'working', 'day', 'day', 'menial', 'jobs', 'father', 'Having', 'once', 'been', 'merchant', 'marine', 'no', 'longer', 'return', 'life', 'so', 'forward', 'hopes', 'creating', 'music', 'getting', 'lucky', 'break.But', 'movie', 'slowly', 'get', 'glimpse', 'real', 'world', 'Llewyn', 'live', 'Jean', 'pregnant', 'unsure', 'child', 'Jim', 'thus', 'abortion', 'just', 'case', 'resentment', 'Llewyn', 'putting', 'position', 'tinged', 'not', 'guilt', 'so', 'much', 'anger', 'children', 'Jim', 'Llewyn', 'agent', 'always', 'fee', 'rarely', 'ever', 'do', 'much', 'clients', 'Llewyn', 'sister', 'just', 'make', 'something', 'push', 'hard', 'Llewyn', 'sympathetic', 'ear', 'offer', 'him.Word', 'Llewyn', 'one', 'Jim', 'friends', 'making', 'trek', 'Chicago', 'meet', 'Bud', 'Grossman', 'F.', 'Murray', 'Abraham', 'owner', 'biggest', 'folk', 'club', 'producer', 'many', 'who', 'have', 'made', 'field', 'move', 'Llewyn', 'trying', 'find', 'way', 'New', 'York', 'finding', 'ride', 'quiet', 'driver', 'eccentric', 'named', 'Roland', 'Turner', 'John', 'Goodman', 'Cajoled', 'insulted', 'Roland', 'Llewyn', 'duo', 'as', 'long', 'can', 'meeting', 'Grossman', 'could', 'change', 'are', 'two', 'movies', 'work', 'here', 'film', 'most', 'obvious', 'quest', 'Llewyn', 'Davis', 'find', 'vindication', 'work', 'art', 'be', 'loved', 'not', 'form', 'paycheck', 'form', 'adoration', 'same', 'time', 'holding', 'same', 'time', ""'re"", 'given', 'history', 'folk', 'music', 'time', 'period', 'early', 'sixties', 'was', 'transitional', 'period', 'folk', 'music', 'moving', 'classic', 'standards', 'past', 'more', 'personal', 'youthful', 'sound', 'was', 'moved', 'forward', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'film', 'place', 'right', 'middle', 'change.More', 'other', 'Coen', 'film', 'movie', 'heavily', 'music', 'found', 'here', 'watching', 'extras', 'learn', 'person', 'involved', 'played', 'own', 'music', 'most', 'were', 'recorded', 'straight', 'performed', 'think', 'actors', 'could', 'not', 'only', 'act', 'scene', 'perform', 'music', 'as', 'well', 'much', 'authenticity', 'bring', 'character.The', 'story', ""'re"", 'made', 'privy', 'here', 'sad', 'one', 'ways', 'glimmer', 'hope', 'shining', 'end', 'yet', 'have', 'idea', 'when', 'over', 'just', 'what', 'will', 'become', 'Llewyn', 'how', 'should', 'be', 'cardboard', 'cutout', 'look', 'music', 'world', 'where', 'things', 'happen', '90', 'minutes', 'crisis', 'stated', 'solution', 'found', 'world', 'artist', 'who', 'still', 'seeking', 'elusive', 'muse', 'will', 'allow', 'be', 'discovered', 'world.The', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'have', 'done', 'once', 'again', ""'ve"", 'transported', 'place', 'time', 'world', 'might', 'have', 'heard', 'most', 'have', 'never', 'experienced', 'so', 'doing', 'expose', 'well', 'played', 'music', 'incredible', 'actors', 'who', 'appear', 'be', 'characters', ""'re"", 'portraying', 'rather', 'acting', 'so', 'doing', ""'re"", 'given', 'movie', 'visually', 'aurally', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'perhaps', 'even', 'adding', 'collection']",Inside Llewyn Davis

1679193,A27DRF925AA53Q,B00GMV8KGW,Michael Erlewine,"[1, 4]","Of course the movie ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" was well done. It is by the Coen Brothers and all that, but I do have one complaint. The time period between the waning of the influence of the Beats and the rise of what we call The Sixties was just those few years from, say 1959 until the summer of 1965 when the Grateful Dead band formed. Yet those years were not a dead space or a pause, but a very active transition time indeed. However, there has been very little coverage or documenting of that time. Here comes ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" from the Coen Brothers, said to document just that very time in 1961 before the advent of Bob Dylan.Well, that would have to be the winter and early spring of 1961, because Dylan was fully there in late spring. I know because I happened to be traveling with Dylan in New York City in June of 1961 along with my good friend Perry Lederman, one of the great guitar instrumentalists of that era. All three of us hitchhiked together. So it was with great anticipation that I looked forward to seeing this particular film. And now I will explain why for me it was such a disappointment.I am no stranger to movies. After all, I founded the All-Movie Guide, one of the two largest movie databases on the planet, so I have seen my share of movies and then some. My family would testify to this.And so it came as a shock for me to see the gray and somber tone of ""Inside Llewyn Davis,"" flavored more with a Beat or Existentialist tone than the actual experience I remember from the time, which had its downs, of course, but especially it had its ups.After all, Bob Dylan and I were twenty years old in the spring of 1961. Think about that for a moment. Life was fresh, and it was too early to be soured by either age or experience. It was filled with promise and enthusiasm. Sure, we had watched too many Ingmar Bergman movies and thought we were in love with the dark European shtick of those times, but that was just a veneer we tried hard to maintain. Inside we were ebullient Americans and young ones at that. That time was very exciting indeed and we were totally up for it.Unfortunately, the Coen Brothers showed the glass as half-empty, but failed to point out that it was also half-full. This was a big disappointment, because perhaps we will never get another movie about that time period, and this movie does not do the reality justice. It is way too dark IMO.I am happy to see any coverage of this period as compared to none, but the big news of then was not the dying of The Beat movement with its drab and ""so serious"" take on life, but just the opposite, the first signs of husking that faade off and the discovery that we young Americans wanted to live and love life, which the later 1960s would prove.So thanks Coen Brothers for thinking of us and those times but, in my opinion, you missed the main point of way back then. To paraphrase Dylan, those not busy dying were busy being born.We were busy being born and that experience, dear Cohen Brothers, would have made a great film.",3,From the Founder of the All-Movie Guide,1399248000,"05 5, 2014",2014,3022,"['course', 'movie', 'Inside', 'Llewyn', 'Davis', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'do', 'have', 'one', 'complaint', 'time', 'period', 'waning', 'influence', 'Beats', 'rise', 'what', 'call', 'Sixties', 'was', 'just', 'few', 'years', 'say', '1959', 'summer', '1965', 'when', 'Grateful', 'Dead', 'band', 'formed', 'years', 'were', 'not', 'dead', 'space', 'pause', 'very', 'active', 'transition', 'time', 'indeed', 'However', 'been', 'very', 'little', 'coverage', 'documenting', 'time', 'Here', 'Inside', 'Llewyn', 'Davis', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'said', 'document', 'just', 'very', 'time', '1961', 'advent', 'Bob', 'Dylan.Well', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'winter', 'early', 'spring', '1961', 'Dylan', 'was', 'fully', 'there', 'late', 'spring', 'know', 'happened', 'be', 'traveling', 'Dylan', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'June', '1961', 'good', 'friend', 'Perry', 'Lederman', 'one', 'great', 'guitar', 'instrumentalists', 'era', 'three', 'hitchhiked', 'together', 'was', 'great', 'anticipation', 'looked', 'forward', 'seeing', 'particular', 'film', 'now', 'will', 'explain', 'why', 'was', 'such', 'disappointment.I', 'am', 'stranger', 'movies', 'founded', 'All-Movie', 'Guide', 'one', 'two', 'largest', 'movie', 'databases', 'planet', 'have', 'seen', 'share', 'movies', 'then', 'family', 'would', 'testify', 'this.And', 'came', 'shock', 'see', 'gray', 'somber', 'tone', 'Inside', 'Llewyn', 'Davis', 'flavored', 'more', 'Beat', 'Existentialist', 'tone', 'actual', 'experience', 'remember', 'time', 'had', 'downs', 'course', 'especially', 'had', 'ups.After', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'were', 'twenty', 'years', 'old', 'spring', '1961', 'Think', 'moment', 'Life', 'was', 'fresh', 'was', 'too', 'early', 'be', 'soured', 'age', 'experience', 'was', 'filled', 'promise', 'enthusiasm', 'Sure', 'had', 'watched', 'too', 'many', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'movies', 'thought', 'were', 'love', 'dark', 'European', 'shtick', 'times', 'was', 'just', 'veneer', 'tried', 'hard', 'maintain', 'were', 'ebullient', 'Americans', 'young', 'ones', 'time', 'was', 'very', 'exciting', 'indeed', 'were', 'totally', 'up', 'it.Unfortunately', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'showed', 'glass', 'half-empty', 'failed', 'point', 'out', 'was', 'also', 'half-full', 'was', 'big', 'disappointment', 'perhaps', 'will', 'never', 'get', 'movie', 'time', 'period', 'movie', 'not', 'do', 'reality', 'justice', 'way', 'too', 'dark', 'IMO.I', 'am', 'happy', 'see', 'coverage', 'period', 'compared', 'none', 'big', 'news', 'then', 'was', 'not', 'dying', 'Beat', 'movement', 'drab', 'so', 'serious', 'take', 'life', 'just', 'opposite', 'first', 'signs', 'husking', 'faade', 'discovery', 'young', 'Americans', 'wanted', 'live', 'love', 'life', 'later', '1960s', 'would', 'prove.So', 'thanks', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'thinking', 'times', 'opinion', 'missed', 'main', 'point', 'way', 'back', 'then', 'paraphrase', 'Dylan', 'not', 'busy', 'dying', 'were', 'busy', 'being', 'born.We', 'were', 'busy', 'being', 'born', 'experience', 'dear', 'Cohen', 'Brothers', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'great', 'film']",Inside Llewyn Davis

1679195,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00GMV8KGW,M. Oleson,"[1, 4]","Theatrical review.  There may be spoilers.Ethan and Joel Coen are as good as anybody and writing and assembling quirky comedic dramas.  While this film has plenty of humor spilling from the mouths of their characters - well except for Johnny Five (Garrett Hedlund) who just grunts - this has a more serious tone than most of their films.Llewyn Davis (an excellent Oscar Isaac) is a struggling folk singer who was just getting started as part of a duo when his partner (seen only in photos) commits suicide by jumping off the George Washington Bridge in NYC.  As a washed up jazz musician (John Goodman) who gives Llewyn a ride says, ""Why the GW Bridge?  There's no class in jumping off that bridge.""  An example of the dark humor.If you've ever known anyone like Llewyn (I have) you can empathize yet, he's not a very likable character.  He's a good singer and writes good songs for a limited if fervent audience.  But he can't quite get over the hump.  He has some skills but not the wherewithal to win over producers or audiences.  The last scene is a punch in the gut to what might have been.Since he rarely has any money, he has no real place to call home, so he mooches off friends, former lovers, a sister and anybody else who has a couch.  He struggles and he seemingly never gets a break.  That's pretty much the story.  And that is pretty much the problem.  There's just not much there, there.  Just snappy dialog and occasional scenes that come to life, generally when music is playing.The film has a strong cast.  Carey Mulligan is a former lover who turns up pregnant with what may or may not be Llewyn's child.  Justin Timberlake is her current beau and good friend of both.  Adam Driver and Alex Karpovsky (both from TV's ""Girls"") have minor roles.  Llewyn Davis is certainly better than most films that come out but it has to rate as one of the Coen's lesser efforts.",4,3 1/2 stars for a good if flawed Coen Brothers film,1389657600,"01 14, 2014",2014,1882,"['Theatrical', 'review', 'may', 'be', 'spoilers.Ethan', 'Joel', 'Coen', 'are', 'as', 'good', 'anybody', 'writing', 'assembling', 'quirky', 'comedic', 'dramas', 'film', 'plenty', 'humor', 'spilling', 'mouths', 'characters', 'well', 'Johnny', 'Five', 'Garrett', 'Hedlund', 'who', 'just', 'grunts', 'more', 'serious', 'tone', 'most', 'films.Llewyn', 'Davis', 'excellent', 'Oscar', 'Isaac', 'struggling', 'folk', 'singer', 'who', 'was', 'just', 'getting', 'started', 'part', 'duo', 'when', 'partner', 'seen', 'only', 'photos', 'commits', 'suicide', 'jumping', 'off', 'George', 'Washington', 'Bridge', 'NYC', 'washed', 'up', 'jazz', 'musician', 'John', 'Goodman', 'who', 'Llewyn', 'ride', 'Why', 'GW', 'Bridge', 'class', 'jumping', 'off', 'bridge', 'example', 'dark', 'humor.If', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'known', 'anyone', 'Llewyn', 'have', 'can', 'empathize', 'yet', 'not', 'very', 'likable', 'character', 'good', 'singer', 'good', 'songs', 'limited', 'fervent', 'audience', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'get', 'hump', 'skills', 'not', 'wherewithal', 'win', 'over', 'producers', 'audiences', 'last', 'scene', 'punch', 'gut', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been.Since', 'rarely', 'money', 'real', 'place', 'call', 'home', 'friends', 'former', 'lovers', 'sister', 'anybody', 'else', 'who', 'couch', 'seemingly', 'never', 'break', 'pretty', 'much', 'story', 'pretty', 'much', 'problem', 'just', 'not', 'much', 'there', 'Just', 'snappy', 'dialog', 'occasional', 'scenes', 'come', 'life', 'generally', 'when', 'music', 'playing.The', 'film', 'strong', 'cast', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'former', 'lover', 'who', 'up', 'pregnant', 'what', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'Llewyn', 'child', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', 'current', 'beau', 'good', 'friend', 'Adam', 'Driver', 'Alex', 'Karpovsky', 'TV', 'Girls', 'have', 'minor', 'roles', 'Llewyn', 'Davis', 'certainly', 'better', 'most', 'films', 'come', 'out', 'rate', 'one', 'Coen', 'lesser', 'efforts']",Inside Llewyn Davis

1679200,A3VNV65XYKKY6A,B00GMV8KGW,Noddy Box,"[53, 72]","That line by Mrs. Gorfein as she accusingly displays the undercarriage of the wrong cat still cracks me up. Besides being by turns deliciously moody and hilarious, this movie boasts a boatload of other reasons to watch it not  just once but many times. New York City is a knockout on screen thanks to some seriously crafty camerawork and all the characters are stylishly and inventively filmed. The music itself is folk music obviously but some of it ain't too shabby and the song Please Mr. Kennedy is a priceless slice of time warp. Am falling asleep at the keys here so I'll come back tomorrow and continue my roomy nations. Well it's tommorrow now and boy did it ever snow in the interim: New York in February can be a big fat smorsgaborgy of intensely winterised weather conditions and it's just occurred to me that this movie here also takes place in New York in February coz when Llewyn is signing papers for the session fee I think I caught a glimpse of the date on one of the forms. Jeepers, no wonder Lewyn was a tad splenetic about not having an overcoat. But back to how atmospherically handsome this film looks: Ace cinematographer Roger Deakins has worked his lenser's magic for the Coen boys in a bunch of their previous pictures but here the brothers opted for some French dude, Bruno Delbonnel, and the result is totally tray tray bong: The look is expressively lit nighttime mostly but even the scenes in what daylight there is are beautifully framed and coolly washed out. Acting is top-shelf all round with Oscar Isaac in particular playing a blinder in the lead role. Some folks have expressed reservations about the likability of this troubled troubadour but me personally I found him to be a credibly complicated and intelligent character plus wit-wise he's razor sharp and full of hysterical zingers and one-liners. Kudos to the cat too--he or she more or less steals every scene he or she is in. Another decided merit of this fab little flick is the decision to play out each song to the end--not only does this do full justice to what Llewyn and his fellow folkies are actually really good at but it paces the movie perfectly. These songs are supremely stylish punctuation points, on a par with those other cinematic humdingers put to effective use here: the fade to black and the slow dissolve. The overall chronology of the film had me slightly baffled at first, what with those seemingly identical scenes bookending the action, but I reckon if you take that first scene--where Grandma Moses's husband boxes Llewyn's ears--as the last scene proper and take the second scene where Llewyn wakes up with the marmalade-coloured cat in his face as the actual first scene from which everything then follows naturally, I think some kind of sense can be made of the sneaky way this picture unfolds. By this reckoning one must assume that Lewyn is shown leaving the Gorfein's apartment on two separate occasions--the first is where he locks himself and the cat out and the second is where he just locks himself out. I'm not even going to go into symbolism or allegory here because the meaning of both those words has always eluded me. I mean, the Gorfein's cat turns out to be named Ulysses. What can one say about that? Well there are two Ulysses, aren't there? One is a dude in a book and the other is a book. That's as far as I'm prepared to go and I respectfully leave the remainder to them with the brainpower to successfully winkle it all out. Last but obviously not least is Ethan and Joel's scintillating script: their ability to mix pathos with outrageous humour while leaving ample room for surreal twists of anxiety, wonder and genuine affection is a sight for sore eyes and a sound for sore ears. For example, Lewyn's car ride to Chicago is a perfectly realized descent into existential dread, worthy of David Lynch at his creepiest. For my dosh Inside Llewyn Davis is up there with the best films the Coens have made--and I hate folk music. Hate is perhaps a strong word but I'm generally not partial to lyrics in my music of choice (rock and/or roll), they tend to disrupt the electric and friendly vibe I always find, and folk music relies pretty heavily on lyrics, so you can see the kind of jam I'm in. Still the songs sung here are undoubtedly a passion for those who play them and I fully appreciate their place and purpose in this film. So then, in addition to the five stars above I also give Inside Llewyn Davis eleven thumbs up.",5,"Where's its scrotum, Llewyn?

1679201,A14SOHUCCL0606,B00GMV8KGW,Nowhere Man,"[4, 7]","This is probably the Coen brothers' most polarizing film - either you see it as a beautiful, if disenchanted, evocation of the New York folk scene of the early 1960s, or as a hundred-minute downer about a self-loathing dead-ender. It's neither, really, but it's also more than the sum of its parts. In truth, ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" isn't particularly interested in the folk scene as such; it's really more of a setting for the Coens to bemusedly watch a singer (Oscar Isaac) lose the last vestiges of whatever led him into music to begin with. Llewyn Davis has been part of the Greenwich Village scene for awhile - long enough to have been part of a semi-successful duo and to get a couple of girls pregnant - but he's stuck living on the margins, running in a hamster wheel of endless club gigs. The film charts the myriad ways he both shoots himself in the foot with his few remaining friends and tries, and fails, to break out of his rut.In other words, ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" is really about disenchantment: how the world, the commercial world especially, will grind down the things that give your life joy and meaning. When we watch him perform at the film's beginning, Oscar Isaac conveys not only Davis' expressive talent, but also what these tunes have meant to him and how they have sustained him. As the film batters away at him - literally at times - we watch that already faint light grow progressively dimmer until the Coens' deliver their ultimate cosmic joke: a Minnesota kid who debuts on the stage after him and just as Lewis is getting pounded behind the club.""Inside Llewyn Davis"" establishes a cold-sober tone; there's no warm nostalgia in the Coens' recreation of the early 1960s. If you're hoping for a romanticized vision of the early folk scene, look elsewhere. And while the film is quite funny, this is a particularly vinegary comedy where the humor always comes with a nasty sting. The Coens have made it their stock-in-trade to dissect, often cruelly, those that fail in American life (""Barton Fink,"" ""Fargo,"" ""Lebowski,"" ""No Country For Old Men,"" ""A Simple Man"") and ""Llewyn Davis"" is their bitterest film yet.  Personally, I liked the Coens' determination not to be likable or to go soft here, but I can well understand why many critics and others have found this film so off-putting. They don't yield Llewyn Davis, or us, an inch. For some, this will seem like punishment but, for me, it is mark of integrity -- ""Llewyn Davis"" is about anyone who's ever had to cash out their aspirations and join the real world.

1679202,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00GMV8KGW,Paul Allaer,"[20, 29]","""Inside Llewyn Davis"" (2013 release; 105 min.) brings the (fictional) story of a folk singer named Llewyn Davis as he tries to build fame in 1961 New York. As the movie opens, we see Davis perform at the famous Gaslight Caf&eacute; in what appears to be just another routine performance. Soon thereafter, we learn that Davis has no money and literally couch-hops from one night to the next between friends. We get to know Davis; friends Jean and Jim, and later learn that Jean is pregnant and she is not certain who the father is although she thinks it's Llewyn, not Jim. Out of money, Davis bitterly complains to his agent that he didn't get an advance on his recently released solo record (called ""Inside Llewyn Davis"") and surely he should get some royalties? Now he is desperate and he decides to go to Chicago to meet with the legendary Bud Grossman, an influential guy in the music business. To tell you more about the film 'plot' would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: first and foremost, there has been quite a bit of speculation in the press and elsewhere whether this movie is intended as a parody or send-up by the Coen brothers of the early 1960s folk scene. I can tell you that this is not the case at all, and that this is actually a straight take on that era. Second, the movie takes some inspiration from the real-life NY folk singer from that era, Dave Van Ronk. Third, the Coen brothers have admitted in interviews that 'there is no plot in this movie, reason why we threw in the cat'. Yes, the cat owned by the Gorfeins (friends of Davis) plays a role but to the Coens' point: this movie provides a snap-shot of that era, and does not focus on plot twists or even plot resolution. It didn't bother me one bit, as I was fascinated with the impressions of that era as painted by the Coens. Fourth, this movie oozes great performances, starting with Oscar Isaac in the title role, but check out Carey Mulligan as Jean, in her best role since ""An Education"" and Justin Timberlake as her husband Jim. But make sure to watch for F. Murray Abraham in the small role of Bud Grossman. After Davis does an on-the-spot audition for Grossman, Grossman comments dryly and devastatingly to Davis ""I don't see a lot of money here"", wow! Towards the end of the movie, Davis comments to the Gaslight Caf&eacute; audience ""it's never new and it never gets old, it's a folk song"", and that about sums it up.I saw this film during a recent family visit in Belgium, and the theatre where I saw this at was reasonably well attended, which surprised me a little bit, given the heavy American tone and focus of this. I guess some people in Belgium do care about the New York folk scene from the early 60s after all. If you are a fan of that era, this movie is a must-see, but even if you are not, I would recommend it. I know I enjoyed this from start to finish. The movie is finally coming out shortly in the US, and is already rumored to ne in line for multiple award nominations, and deservedly so.

1679203,AB6BQXTOMO7F7,B00GMV8KGW,PJS1975,"[4, 10]","Because this reviewer's January 21, 2011 review explaining N.W. Refn's ""Valhalla Rising"" has generated many positive responses, with over 90% of respondents describing that review as helpful, here is the same former police detective's interpretation of ""Inside Llewyn Davis"":THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSTo their credit, if the Coen brothers made ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" with the intention of creating a film full of hidden meanings and subtle symbolism, then they managed to conceal all of those meanings and symbols extremely well. I will be the first to say that ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" did not make a lot of sense to me at the time I saw it. Admittedly, I don't know who or what Llewyn Davis is/was supposed to be.What I do know is that the Coens appear to be quite fond of allegory and symbolism. I also know they are huge fans of ""The Odyssey"" (as seen in one of their best films ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?""). So, I did a bit of research online, and this is what I came up with. Of course, as with the review I wrote for ""Valhalla Rising,"" I'm not entirely sure if any of what I have written below is, in fact, what the Coens wanted to convey with their film. Likely, I'm way, way off base. But here are my off-base thoughts anyway, for what they're worth....First of all, I wondered about this one thing a lot: Why did the filmmakers made such a point of telling their audience that ""Ulysses"" (a.k.a. ""Odysseus"") was the name of the marmalade cat that Llewyn Davis spent much of the film chasing down?I also started thinking more and more about the shadowy man in the wide-brimmed hat, who beat up Llewyn Davis outside of the Gaslight Club at the beginning of the film (and again at the end, replayed), and why the filmmakers didn't want to show the audience his face.This will probably sound rather silly, but the more I thought about it, the more I imagined ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" to be perhaps yet another Coen brothers' retelling of ""The Odyssey"" by Homer, but this time the story was told from the perspective of one of the Suitors of Penelope.Perhaps the filmmakers, once again working within the context of Homer's Odyssey, intended for the Llewyn Davis character to represent one of those false-hearted suitors. But in this case, the ""mistress"" that Davis wanted to woo and win over was the ""spirit"" (muse?) of that particular artistic movement circa 1961, a movement that many of the people who grew up during those years still recall with approbative phrases, such as ""defined an era"" and ""voice of a generation.""And, as it was in Homer's Odyssey, suitor Llewyn Davis was a man wooing with a false heart. At various times, I got the strong impression that Davis's heart just wasn't in it anymore, not since the death of his friend and collaborator Mike Timlin.At one point towards the middle of the film, when Davis got angry during a performance of ""Fare Thee Well"" at the Gorfeins' dinner party, he shouted at them something like: ""This is what I do for a living! This is what I do to pay the bills!""When I recalled that scene, I thought the filmmakers might have been trying to convey that the part of him that had loved folk music died when his collaborator Mike Timlin died. Or maybe Mike Timlin himself was in the end only a symbol, and in that sense he was supposed to be the actual part of Llewyn Davis that had loved folk music, and that part of Davis was now dead.I started considering that if a certain place and time and group of people can be said to possess a certain ""spirit"" or ""embodiment"" that directs its artistic development - its ""muse,"" in other words - (and I'm talking about the SoHo neighborhood during the early 1960s, where Bob Dylan and his contemporaries got their start) then maybe Llewyn Davis's failure to become a legendary folk-singer was intended to be seen as that particular artistic movement (or its muse or Grecian-esque spirit) rejecting his advances. The audience gets to see Davis's repeated attempts to woo her, and her repeated rejections, just as Penelope rejected all of her false suitors.So, after Davis gets rejected by that artistic movement - because of his heart not being in it, and because of how he mocked the hammered dulcimer-playing folk singer near the end, shouting at her: ""I HATE FOLK MUSIC!!!"" - I imagined that maybe Odysseus, the man himself, at last showed up (kind of), and he rid his Penelope of that false Suitor, Davis. But instead of killing him, as was done in Homer's Odyssey, this version of Odysseus merely beat Davis up in order to express his condemnation of him.Other little clues:1) Davis brings the wrong marmalade cat back to the Gorfeins, instead of the real ""Ulysses"" cat. Maybe it's another indicator of (or metaphor for) Davis's own false-hearted suitorhood?2) Llewyn Davis went to The Gate of Horn in Chicago (a real place, of course). In the theater, I remember thinking, ""That's an unusual name for a venue. I wonder if it has any significance?"" Yes, as it turns out. Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't allow the insertion of links to Wikipedia, so you'll just have to Google the article called ""Gates of horn and ivory"" and read about how Homer's Odyssey refers to these gates.So, if the ""gate of horn"" has a particular significance in the oldest examples of Greek literature, then those dreams which do not pass through the gate of horn are supposedly false dreams.I then considered that Davis, after he's completed his long ""odyssey"" from NYC to Chicago, in a way finds out that he's not the real Odysseus. Instead, he's just a suitor trying to woo, and like the suitors in Homer's Odyssey, his character views a lucrative, career-defining record deal with Bud Grossman (F. Murray Abraham's character) as merely a prize to be won, a feather in his cap, but in truth there is no actual love (for the art of 1960s folk music) in Llewyn Davis's heart.As stated in the Wikipedia article above, Penelope in the real ""The Odyssey"" feels that her dream suggesting that Odysseus will return to her is not a true prediction of the future; she feels that her dream of her husband did not pass through the symbolic ""gate of horn."" Similarly, Llewyn Davis fails his audition with Grossman at The Gate of Horn club. Did the Coen brothers use this scene to convey the idea that Davis is not the real Odysseus coming home? He failed to pass through the Gate of Horn; therefore, Davis's vision of himself, as a folk-singer of the talent and the caliber that could impress Grossman and make it big, is a false vision.3) Llewyn Davis drives past the exit for Akron on the way back from Chicago to NYC. Maybe that's supposed to be telling the audience - again, in a different way - that Davis is not the real Odysseus. According to the story, Davis's son (a stand-in for Telemachus?) and his son's mother are both waiting for him in Akron, OH. I guess placing them in Ithaca, NY would've made it too obvious?""Akron"" is a Greek word meaning ""high place."" Did the Coens intend for this to mean that Davis passed up the chance (or perhaps lacked the strength of character) to climb out of the ""depths"" of his situation, and ascend to that ""high place"" where his son and his son's mother were waiting for him, in a way that could be seen as analogous to Telemachus and Penelope waiting for Ulysses to return to Ithaca? I don't know, honestly.As I stated at the beginning of this review, I don't know if any of the above conjectures about the film are accurate or not. I just kind of used the Coen brothers' other film ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" as a shaky starting point for what the filmmakers might have been trying to convey, and went from there.UPDATED: My SO corrected what I wrote above, that Davis's son and the mother of his son were ""waiting for"" him in Akron. She pointed out that the scene in which the abortion doctor informs Davis that his former paramour, without bothering to say so much as a word to Davis, decided instead to carry her pregnancy to term and move to Akron with her newborn son, that this action plainly shows that mother and son were not in fact ""waiting for"" Davis, that she only wanted Davis out of her life, and indeed she would have wanted nothing to do with him even if he had showed up on her doorstep.",4,"Police detective (kind of) explains ""Inside Llewyn Davis""",1390867200,"01 28, 2014",2014,8217,"['reviewer', 'January',

Edward Merrell, Jr. ""emerrell2""","[0, 2]","The Coen Brothers travel down memory lane for this one; and if you love folk music and the early folk scene in Greenwich Village, you will love this film. Llewyn Davis is a fictional character...a composite with characteristics of real folk singers like Dave Von Ronk, Ramblin' Jack Elliot, etc. The Coen's received inspiration from Von Ronk's posthumously published memoir; but Davis is meant to represent the many singers on the folk scene in New York who never made it to the big time. Oscar Isaac delivers an inspired performance in the lead...both as a singer and as a dramatic performer. Set in 1961, virtually all the songs that are performed are from the early folk music scene and virtually all are performed in their entirety...the sound track is arguably the best part of this film! In addition to Isaac, look for a fine performance from Carey Mulligan, who we last saw in &#34;The Great Gatsby&#34;. Mulligan has developed into a talented actress with excellent range...she is half the folk duo, Jean and Jim; the other half of the duo is played by Justin Timberlake. The always dependable John Goodman does well in a support role. Toward the end of the film, listen for the biggest talent to emerge from the 60's folk scene, Bob Dylan.

He's magnificent in his portrayal of a guy who has something to offer but can't cut a break. He's totally enjoyable. Many have said that the film has a mean spirit, but it's only out of the greed of the moguls at the time (no different than now). Sure, Llewyn isn't perfect, regarding social skills, but not enough is said about the suicide of his singing partner, which is my only argument with his character. The Coens, in their wisdom, chose to have you see Llewyn as he is, and not as he thought he'd be.He's fragile, more than you think. He's triggered by simple things, but there's an innate subtext of survival and a joy of life. The cat is more important than you think. His scenes with John Goodman reflect perfectly how much he hates phonies. His scenes with Carrie Mulligan reflect perfectly how he views himself in the worldly scheme of things. He's flawed and knows it.He;s been duped by so many people, he's become a self-serving maverick, since he no longer knows who to count on or believe in. His apathy toward the subject of abortion is simply a sign of the times.The film took place in early 1960's Greenwich Village, long before Dylan, Peter Paul & Mary or Joan Baez. Not too long after Kerouak. It was a time, after Eisenhower's administration, when life was fairly relaxed and comfortable. The song, &#34;Please Mr. Kennedy&#34; was a rousing and fun moment, not political at all.The Coens have provided yet another terrific riff on a specific element of American sensibility.

The moral journey of Llewyn Davis (maybe the Coens' greatest character) through what seems to be the worst week of his life serves as a metaphor of the human condition.  In fact, his journey is really his 'Odyssey' (to emphasize this, the wonderful cat in the film -- Llewyn's closest relationship -- is named 'Ulysses').  I even think of the myth of Sisyphus (existential? ...think Camus' ""Myth of Sisyphus""!) spending his life working repeatedly to push a huge boulder up a steep mountain to have it keep rolling back down again).  Like Laurel and Hardy pushing that piano up the countless steps, I see Davis more as someone with whom we can empathize as he continues to crap out; others see him as a slimeball.  Take your choice, but I think not to identify with him is to negate the universal meaning of the film.Appropriately, the film has a muted color palette by the great 56-year-old French cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel (known for his images of 'fantastic realism' for Jean-Pierre Jeunet films like ""Amelie"" and ""A Very Long Engagement"").  It provides the perfect melancholic mood for the protagonist's journey and Delbonnel consciously worked to replicate the look and feel of the cover of ""The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan"" record album, succeeding to make the film appear ""slushy"" as a New York City winter.It has a sense of deep humanity in every performance (especially Oscar Isaac as the serious-minded, existential 'hero' who conveys brilliantly his interaction with the other people around him), a wonderfully evocative song score (most of which is recorded live), and not a single false scene or shot thanks to Joel and Ethan Coen's cinematic mastery.  It deservedly won the Grand Prix Award at the Cannes Film Festival, was picked by the National Society of Film Critics as the year's best film, and is easily my choice as the finest film of 2013.As far as the transfer, the muted and 'slushy' look of the film ironically requires Blu-ray because of its clarity.  I find the DVD doesn't do justice to the film even though the transfer is probably perfect.  Also, the Blu-ray has a wonderful 42-minute documentary on the film's making (spending most of its time on the music recording), so I'd splurge for the Blu-ray.",5,A Perfect Masterpiece from the Coen Brothers,1394928000,"03 16, 2014",2014,2743,"['Coen', 'Brothers', 'Inside', 'Llewyn', 'Davis', 'week', 'life', 'frustrated', 'folk', 'singer', 'partly', 'modeled', 'real', 'life', 'Dave', 'Van', 'Ronk', 'Greenwich', 'Village', 'folk', 'scene', '1961', 'when', 'beat', 'generation', 'giving', 'way', 'hippy', 'movement.This', 'cinematic', 'masterpiece', 'thin', 'tightrope', 'being', 'darkly', 'melancholic', 'absurdly', 'comic', 'as', 'well', 'life', 'affirming', 'found', 'be', 'one', 'smartest', 'most', 'profound', 'works', 'existential', 'art', 'ever', 'produced', 'medium', 'moral', 'journey', 'Llewyn', 'Davis', 'maybe', 'Coens', 'greatest', 'character', 'what', 'be', 'worst', 'week', 'life', 'metaphor', 'human', 'condition', 'fact', 'journey', 'really', ""'Odyssey"", 'emphasize', 'wonderful', 'cat', 'film', 'Llewyn', 'closest', 'relationship', 'named', ""'Ulysses"", 'even', 'think', 'myth', 'Sisyphus', 'existential', 'think', 'Camus', 'Myth', 'Sisyphus', 'spending', 'life', 'working', 'repeatedly', 'push', 'huge', 'boulder', 'up', 'steep', 'mountain', 'have', 'keep', 'rolling', 'back', 'down', 'again', 'Laurel', 'Hardy', 'pushing', 'piano', 'countless', 'steps', 'see', 'Davis', 'more', 'someone', 'whom', 'can', 'empathize', 'crap', 'out', 'others', 'see', 'slimeball', 'Take', 'choice', 'think', 'not', 'identify', 'negate', 'universal', 'meaning', 'film.Appropriately', 'film', 'muted', 'color', 'palette', 'great', '56-year-old', 'French', 'cinematographer', 'Bruno', 'Delbonnel', 'known', 'images', ""'fantastic"", 'realism', 'Jean-Pierre', 'Jeunet', 'films', 'Amelie', 'Very', 'Long', 'Engagement', 'perfect', 'melancholic', 'mood', 'protagonist', 'journey', 'Delbonnel', 'consciously', 'worked', 'replicate', 'look', 'feel', 'cover', 'Freewheelin', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'record', 'album', 'succeeding', 'make', 'film', 'appear', 'slushy', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'winter.It', 'sense', 'deep', 'humanity', 'performance', 'especially', 'Oscar', 'Isaac', 'serious-minded', 'existential', ""'hero"", 'who', 'conveys', 'brilliantly', 'interaction', 'other', 'people', 'wonderfully', 'evocative', 'song', 'score', 'most', 'recorded', 'live', 'not', 'single', 'false', 'scene', 'shot', 'thanks', 'Joel', 'Ethan', 'Coen', 'cinematic', 'mastery', 'deservedly', 'won', 'Grand', 'Prix', 'Award', 'Cannes', 'Film', 'Festival', 'was', 'picked', 'National', 'Society', 'Film', 'Critics', 'year', 'best', 'film', 'easily', 'choice', 'finest', 'film', '2013.As', 'far', 'transfer', 'muted', ""'slushy"", 'look', 'film', 'ironically', 'Blu-ray', 'clarity', 'find', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'do', 'justice', 'film', 'even', 'transfer', 'probably', 'perfect', 'Also', 'Blu-ray', 'wonderful', '42-minute', 'documentary', 'film', 'making', 'spending', 'most', 'time', 'music', 'recording', 'so', ""'d"", 'splurge', 'Blu-ray']",Inside Llewyn Davis
1679212,A3VO05LD5WSO9F,B00GMV8KGW,Robert Hayes,"[0, 1]","I've been a longtime admirer of the Coen Brothers, and they have made some of my favorite films. Still, most of them have been accessible in some way. This one was quite a hard nut to crack. INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS is a loose story about a down-on-his-luck singer named Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac). To name a few problems, his former musical partner committed suicide, one of his sexual flings is pregnant and it may or may not be his, and he was recently let go from his record company. In other words, life is hard for him. To make matters worse, he isn't too sympathetic of a character either. His go-it-alone nature and tendency to speak his mind get him into hot water with a whole host of people he meets over the course of the film. And yet he keeps on going, devoted to pursuing his chosen profession. That was my way in, and what eventually helped me get into the movie. Despite what life threw at him, he never gave up. Not only that, but there were some truly soul-stirring songs peppered throughout which helped to lighten the mood, even if they did describe things like saying farewell and being hanged. I also enjoyed the color palette and general visual aesthetic of the film. It was almost like chiaroscuro with muted blues, grays and browns. Also, like most Coen Brothers films, this was a comedy, although there was more of a greater tragic/melancholy tone this time around. The closest comparison I can make is with their previous effort A SERIOUS MAN, which dealt with similar themes of a man against the world and falling victim to circumstance. However, LLEWYN DAVIS is played straighter and has a more uplifting resolution, if one can call it that. Overall, though my patience was tested at times, it was rewarded somewhat in the end. As far as technical filmmaking quality and the performers/performances involved, this some of the Coens' best work, even if it was a little dense for me at first. This probably isn't the best film for Coen Brothers initiates, but for seasoned viewers I feel like this could hold something special. In fact, I'll probably get more out of a second or third watch myself.

1679214,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00GMV8KGW,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 2]","***1/2Llewyn Davis is what one of the characters in the movie calls a &#34;loser.&#34; That is, a struggling folk musician in 1961 Greenwich Village who's so bad off he doesn't even have a place to call his own. Instead, he's been reduced to sleeping on friends' couches for as long as they're willing to put up with him. Then it's on to someone else's place (he seems to have a rotation system set up amongst a group of regulars). Llewyn has also recently become a solo act following the suicide of his partner, and no one seems much interested in hiring Llewyn to play on his own. To further complicate matters, it seems Llewyn might just have impregnated his best friend's wife during a recent one-night stand, a woman, by the way, who really can't stand a thing about Llewyn, least of all the prospect of being a mother to his child.In comparison to the flamboyance of some of their more recent works such as &#34;No Country for Old Men&#34; and &#34;Burn After Reading,&#34; &#34;Inside Llewyn Davis&#34; finds Joel and Ethan Coen at their most subdued, spare and inward-looking. More somber mood-piece than narrative-driven drama, this is what we get when the boys decide to compose in a minor key. As such, the movie may try the patience of some in the audience and appear too slight to others, especially with its lack of a clear-cut resolution come fadeout time. The movie becomes especially stripped-down when Llewyn heads off on his own to Chicago in search of a gig, sharing a ride with an enigmatic and eccentric musician/heroin addict played by who else but John Goodman (this IS a Coen brothers movie after all).Llewyn finds his identity and purpose in music and in the counterculture persona he displays to the world. The only trouble is that, while he feels superior to all the unenlightened &#34;squares&#34; whom he sees as having sold out to the Man and to crash commercialism, he's still dependent on those people to lend him a helping hand. After all, what's the point of being your own man when you have to keep throwing yourself on the mercy of others just to find a warm place to bed down for the night? Llewyn's troubles seem to be the result of a combination of factors: a lack of ambition, grief over his partner's death, and his decision to hide behind nonconformity as a justification for never growing up and never accepting the responsibilities that come with being a man.

1679220,A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM,B00GMV8KGW,Stanley Crowe,"[1, 2]","Fans of the Coen brothers will find a number of their trademark strengths in ""Inside Llewyn Davis,"" but if they're like me, they might agree that the whole is less than the sum of the parts. The attention to period detail -- here mostly Greenwich Village and environs c. 1961 -- lends authenticity, and the atmosphere of the smoky little clubs, as well as the small cheap apartments seems right. There are telling images of Llewyn edging to the end of an apartment-building corridor that seems to be getting narrower as it goes, and that seems a perfect image for his ""progress"" in the movie. The subdued tones in the cinematographer's palette have their effect too. Then there's the quirky humor -- here the business with a ginger cat and the near-immortal line, ""Where's his scrotum, Llewyn?"" The cat has another function, though, for it seems to like Llewyn when few others do. He seems to alienate almost everybody -- his friend's girl, played by Carey Mulligan as shrewish and unattractive, his sister, his dad, and, at least temporarily, the cat's owners and the guy who runs the club where we see him perform. But Llewyn as a person has no interest for us (nor do any of the other characters). We can be intrigued for a while by an unpleasant guy who does take his music seriously and wants to succeed in it -- but that's a one-trick pony over an almost two-hour movie. The Coen Brothers have a great feel for the use of music in movies, and this one is no exception -- the actors do their own singing, and it's good, and the songs are given their due -- no snippets of performance here. It's the fact that we hear the songs out, so to speak, that enable us to believe that Llewyn is serious about music if about nothing or no one else.There are two very effective scenes: in the first, Llewyn sings Ewan McColl's great song ""The Shoals of Herring"" to his alienated and by now apparently demented father. ""Here's one you used to like, Dad,"" he says. It's poignant but a bit less weighty than it might be if we knew more about the source of the tensions in the Davis family. The other great scene is in Chicago at the Gate of Horn club, where Llewyn discovers that his agent has NOT sent his demo disc but where the club owner, played by an intent and sober F. Murray Abraham, gives him an audition anyway. He then tells Llewyn, not unkindly, that he's not quite good enough. Would he consider joining a trio? Llewyn doesn't want to be part of a group, but he listens to the club owner patiently and without animosity. He respects, you sense, a man who knows what separates a good performer from a special one, and he leaves quietly. It's perhaps his finest moment in the film. Back in New York, we see him undertaking the gig we saw at the movie's beginning and realize that everything in between is a flashback.What blows a hole in the movie, though, is the long trip by car from New York to Chicago, where Llewyn grabs a ride with a freaky beat poet called Johnny Five and an obese drug-addicted jazz man played by John Goodman. I'll spare you the details, but this whole section drags. Neither jazzman nor poet is remotely interesting, nor is Llewyn interested in them. Goodman can't generate any comic energy out of his character, nor can Garrett Hedland out of the poet. It's a dreary episode in an episodic movie, and while the other episodes are less dreary they aren't all that much more compelling.Don't be afraid to see the movie, though -- it is OK. The look and the music are good, and the actors do what they can with the material. And there's a glimpse at the end, as Llewyn leaves the club, of the act that follows him -- young Bob Dylan, his hair like a halo, singing in a voice that has the distinctiveness that Llewyn's lacks. The movie, though, like Llewyn himself, isn't quite good enough either.",3,""" you ain't goin' nowhere""",1397088000,"04 10, 2014",2014,3823,"['Fans', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'will', 'find', 'number', 'trademark', 'strengths', 'Inside', 'Llewyn', 'Davis', ""'re"", 'might', 'agree', 'whole', 'less', 'sum', 'parts', 'attention', 'period', 'detail', 'here', 'mostly', 'Greenwich', 'Village', 'environs', 'c.', '1961', 'authenticity', 'atmosphere', 'smoky', 'little', 'clubs', 'as', 'well', 'small', 'cheap', 'apartments', 'right', 'are', 'telling', 'images', 'Llewyn', 'edging', 'end', 'apartment-building', 'corridor', 'be', 'getting', 'narrower', 'perfect', 'image', 'progress', 'movie', 'subdued', 'tones', 'cinematographer', 'palette', 'have', 'effect', 'too', 'Then', 'quirky', 'humor', 'here', 'business', 'ginger', 'cat', 'near-immortal', 'line', 'Where', 'scrotum', 'Llewyn', 'cat', 'function', 'though', 'like', 'Llewyn', 'when', 'few', 'others', 'do', 'alienate', 'almost', 'everybody', 'friend', 'girl', 'played', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'shrewish', 'unattractive', 'sister', 'dad', 'least', 'temporarily', 'cat', 'owners', 'guy', 'who', 'club', 'where', 'see', 'perform', 'Llewyn', 'person', 'interest', 'do', 'other', 'characters', 'can', 'be', 'intrigued', 'while', 'unpleasant', 'guy', 'who', 'take', 'music', 'seriously', 'succeed', 'one-trick', 'pony', 'almost', 'two-hour', 'movie', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'have', 'great', 'feel', 'use', 'music', 'movies', 'one', 'exception', 'actors', 'do', 'own', 'singing', 'good', 'songs', 'are', 'given', 'due', 'snippets', 'performance', 'here', 'fact', 'hear', 'songs', 'out', 'so', 'speak', 'enable', 'believe', 'Llewyn', 'serious', 'music', 'nothing', 'one', 'are', 'two', 'very', 'effective', 'scenes', 'first', 'Llewyn', 'Ewan', 'McColl', 'great', 'song', 'Shoals', 'Herring', 'alienated', 'now', 'apparently', 'demented', 'father', 'Here', 'one', 'used', 'like', 'Dad', 'poignant', 'bit', 'less', 'weighty', 'might', 'be', 'knew', 'more', 'source', 'tensions', 'Davis', 'family', 'other', 'great', 'scene', 'Chicago', 'Gate', 'Horn', 'club', 'where', 'Llewyn', 'agent', 'NOT', 'sent', 'demo', 'disc', 'where', 'club', 'owner', 'played', 'intent', 'sober', 'F.', 'Murray', 'Abraham', 'audition', 'anyway', 'then', 'Llewyn', 'not', 'unkindly', 'not', 'quite', 'good', 'enough', 'Would', 'consider', 'joining', 'trio', 'Llewyn', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'part', 'group', 'club', 'owner', 'patiently', 'animosity', 'sense', 'man', 'who', 'what', 'good', 'performer', 'special', 'one', 'quietly', 'perhaps', 'finest', 'moment', 'film', 'Back', 'New', 'York', 'see', 'undertaking', 'gig', 'saw', 'movie', 'beginning', 'realize', 'everything', 'flashback.What', 'hole', 'movie', 'long', 'trip', 'car', 'New', 'York', 'Chicago', 'where', 'Llewyn', 'ride', 'freaky', 'beat', 'poet', 'called', 'Johnny', 'Five', 'obese', 'drug-addicted', 'jazz', 'man', 'played', 'John', 'Goodman', ""'ll"", 'spare', 'details', 'whole', 'section', 'drags', 'jazzman', 'poet', 'remotely', 'interesting', 'Llewyn', 'interested', 'Goodman', 'ca', ""n't"", 'generate', 'comic', 'energy', 'character', 'can', 'Garrett', 'Hedland', 'poet', 'dreary', 'episode', 'episodic', 'movie', 'other', 'episodes', 'are', 'less', 'dreary', 'are', ""n't"", 'all', 'that', 'much', 'more', 'compelling.Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'afraid', 'see', 'movie', 'though', 'OK', 'look', 'music', 'are', 'good', 'actors', 'do', 'what', 'can', 'material', 'glimpse', 'end', 'Llewyn', 'club', 'act', 'young', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'hair', 'halo', 'singing', 'voice', 'distinctiveness', 'Llewyn', 'lacks', 'movie', 'though', 'Llewyn', ""n't"", 'quite', 'good', 'enough', 'either']",Inside Llewyn Davis
1679221,ASEBX8TBYWQWA,B00GMV8KGW,"Steven I. Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[53, 66]","This review is fairly lengthy but I think those interested in the ""Folk Music"" aspect of the film will find it worth reading.First, a point of information: Amazon has a policy to group all reviews of ALL formats of a film (in theaters,streaming,DVD, and BD) together. It is important to note which version the reviewer is commenting on and to note the date of the review (you can sort by Newest First.)  With that said, this is a review of the DVD. It will not be released until  March 11, 2014 but I was sent a copy by the studio in advance.  I did see the film in the theater in December and my review of the film itself will be based on what I wrote then.  The film on the DVD is no different. And, I'm told that Bluray has the same ""Special Feature"" and the print should be the same.  In an ""about face"" from my usual reviews, I will discuss the ""Bonus Features"" - since there are 26 reviews before mine about the film itself.The ""bonuses"" are really singular: One 42-minute ""making of"" featurette titled ""Inside Inside Llewyn Davis"". There is not a trailer - or even previews of other films.  While much of it concerns the music in the film and how the pre-recording was done in a studio for ""practice"", though the performances in the film were done ""live on set"", there are interviews with both Coens, the costume designer and music producer T Bone Burnett.  The rehearsal scenes appeared jump on my HD TV screen and the sharpness varied throughout the featurette. One thing you notice when scenes from the film are included is that the Coens used lots of muted blues and greens in the color palette. They are in sharp contrast from the brighter colors (though still not very bright) of the interview scenes.For those who saw the film in the theater (as I did and will comment below) and wondered why many of the ""real facts"" were wrong, the Coen interviews here will shed some light.  Near the beginning of the interviews, Joel says "" I asked Ethan, ""Wouldn't it be fun to start a movie with Dave Van Ronk being beaten up outside Gerdes' Folk City, and he gets beaten up by Jean Ritchie's husband?"". And Ethan replied "" Who's gonna beat up a folk singer, for goodness sake?"".  Even Burnett - in his interview - says ""we may use real Van Ronk songs, but the rest is a `made-up movie'.""So that's what you can expect on the DVD. I'll now discuss my take on the film itself.This review is aimed primarily at those who want to know how it represents the ""folk music"" of the era.Inside Llewyn Davis is the newest film written and directed by the Coen brothers and - because of all the music included, with T-Bone Burnett on board as Music Producer - it will certainly be compared with the Coen's O Brother Where Art Thou. But even the Coens say (in press note quotes) that is a  different style of film. One of the reasons is that most of the songs featured in the film , and on the Soundtrack CD (coming next week from Nonesuch, a month in advance of the film release), are performed in their entirety. After the name of the film studio (CBS Films/Studio Canal) appears on the screen, we are immediately presented with Isaac (as the ""folk singer"" Llewyn Davis) singing the traditional song ""Hang me, Oh Hang Me"" in the Gaslight coffee house in Greenwich Village in 1961. (The film's title refers to the title of a solo album by Davis that was a sales disaster.)  The song is performed in it's entirely at over three minutes.  Then the story begins. . Davis leaves the coffee house and is attacked by a stranger. Over the next 100 minutes we learn what caused this event.  It's the Coen's version of the Greenwich Village music scene until 1961, when Bob Dylan arrived with his new songs.  The brothers admit that they are too young to have been there in those years and decided to base the title character very loosely on folk music icon Dave Van Ronk and the posthumous autobiography that was finished by writer Elijah Wald after Van Ronk's death in 2002 at age 66. The word ""loosely"" is important here. Isaac neither looks, nor sounds like Van Ronk (viewers will hear Van Ronk's distinctive rough voice in a reprise of the Len Chandler song ""Green Green Rocky Road"" over the closing credits). And, except for the fact that DVR was sang mostly traditional folk songs (though he did write a few), was in the Merchant Marines and travelled to Chicago to try to get a gig at the ""Gate of Horn"", there is little of DVRs life in the script.In the earlier parts of the film there are performers who are ""composites"" of musicians of the era (of which I experienced firsthand) with a soldier from Fort Dix who is obviously based on Tom Paxton (and the actor - Stark Stands - sings Paxton's ""The Last Thing on My Mind""). There is an attempt to show how Peter, Paul and Mary were formed with the Stands' character joining actors Carey Mulligan and Justin Timberlake - as a duo named Jim and Jean - to sing a ""novelty: song -(composed by a ""committee"" including Timberlake, Burnett and the Coens) titled ""Please Mr. Kennedy ""  and release it as by the ""John Glenn Singers"" . It's the only new song in the film and on the soundtrack album. Reading the lengthy press kit I kept being struck with how little the Coen's (and honestly Burnett) knew about the music of the period. First, though there was a real husband/wife duo named Jim & Jean (the Glovers) who had a huge hit with ""Crucifixion"" written by Phil Ochs - who was Glover's college roommate, Ethan Coen is quoted as saying ""There was a real act called Jim and Jean but all we essentially took from them - from their act - was their name. I have no idea who they were as people. Jim and Jean, as they are in the movie, they are our invention"".  And - re: the Kennedy song, Burnett says in an interview that it was based on a real song from 1960s called ""Please Mr. Kennedy, don't send me off to Vietnam"" by Tom Lehrer (who Burnett says he loves. Well Lehrer never wrote such a song. The closest he ever wrote was ""We'll All Go Together When we Go"" and the song in the film is probably closer to Larry Verne's 1960 top ten hit ""Please Mr. Custer"".  There was a recording - in 1962 (a year after the film takes place) titled ""Please Mr. Kennedy"" by a little known group called The Goldcoast Singers, but I'm sure that is not what Burnett is referring to. And the film notes state that state - though not attributed to anyone - that ""other musicians who played on the tracks were Punch Brothers, The Lost City Ramblers, and John Cohen, who played banjo"".  Honestly, I've never heard of TLCR though there was a legendary NYC 60s group, The New Lost City Ramblers, with John Cohen, Tracey Schwarz and Mike Seeger - though Seeger died in 2009 and the group no longer exists.  So much for creditability.Honestly I liked the film. I can't say I loved it. I knew there was a new young cast but I hoped it would be more historically accurate.  If you approach it as a Coen brothers' film - with quirky narratives and monologues (John Goodman's monologue as an obese jazz musician -loosely based on Dr. John or Doc Pomus, though, from what is left in the film, you can't tell that he ever played an instrument- is a classic Coen brothers ""riff"") - you'll enjoy it. And maybe - just like O Brother - younger movie goers will have their music tastes peaked to learn more about Van Ronk and the other Village folkies.Speaking of music, the Coens decided to have all the songs recorded by the actors in a studio first to get them in the mood. Then, during filming (all of which, by the way, was filmed in New York ; even the Chicago scenes), they played and sang live again. It's my understanding that the ""soundtrack"" album is, in fact the studio recordings and not what you are hearing in the film. But I can't be certain.I've been listening to the album for a few weeks and do like it (though it takes some time to get used to Isaac's version of ""Green, Green..."" .For those who are knowledgeable of the REAL characters in Van Ron's life, I'd like to make you aware of a discovery I found only after I re-read the cast credits. Near the end of the film you will see (and hear) a woman playing the autoharp. She's a pivotal character - though only on the screen briefly. You may not recognize her but that is Nancy Blake, who with her husband, Norman was part of the folkie/bluegrass movement in the 1960s.Before I finish this review I want to give special kudos to one of the cast members not previously mentioned.  It's not a human but a male cat (actually played by four different ones). The cat's name is mentioned only once near the end and - surprisingly isn't listed in the credits (or even an internet search) but he/they play a major role in the film as you will see.  Cats are not as easy to train as dogs and this cat is funny!I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",4,"Review of the DVD version - The Coen

1679225,A3KKOJ6T4DCBDT,B00GMV8KGW,"technoguy ""jack""","[3, 4]","Inside Llewyn Davis is both about the early 60s folk movement set in Greenwich Village,loosely based upon features in the life of David Van Ronk,a folksinger who had established his music,moving from jazz/blues in New Orleans to singing folk music in the Village.But it is fiction(just like Fargo was,though prefaced by `based on a true story') and it is a well made film,which looks beautiful (based upon the LP cover of `Freewheelin' Bob Dylan') with a great attention to detail.And it is a Coen Brother's film,who have hired T Bone Burnett to produce the live music to breathe life into the live performances of their fictional folk legend.He did this previously on O Brother,Where Art Thou? with its soundtrack of blues,bluegrass and gospel songs performed by Krauss and Welch and veteran country stars.That was country music but this is urban folk with its shift from communities to its role as a carrier of internalised individual narratives.The story in ILD lives and dies by the music,where whole songs(`Hang me,Oh hang me','Fare thee Well','The Death of Queen Jane'et al) are performed ,employed as plot points and emotional markers.The Coens have done an impressive piece of archaeology.They've also unearthed an impressive new actor,Oscar Isaac,who can also sing and play a guitar.This is an acted film with impressive performances.The plot is kick-started by him getting beaten up outside Guerde's Folk City and it comes back full circle at the end,but on a more hopeful note.There's also the use of a ginger cat,which is used as a plot device and a way of staying close to the character's humanity.The cat escapes,then he finds what he thinks is the cat,then he knocks a cat over on the way back from Chicago,then the real one comes back.This reinforces the story's circularity,sealing the insularity of the film as the Greenwich Village part drops away and we get this individual's story.Set in a bleak,wintery landscape of overcast skies and subdued colour-tones.Isaac imbues the part with warmth,humanity and a desultory pathos.He is a Coen loser,who is not ambitious,doesn't know what he wants,is going nowhere,sleeping on various friend's sofas for the night,waiting for a break,having lost a singing partner to suicide (but refusing to join a Peter, Paul & Mary set up when it's offered him by Bud Grossman). The songs he sings are mostly all traditional,done to earn a living not done for friends.He often sings on other people's songs as he is humorously shown to on a song written by Jim(Timberlake),but gets no royalties,only a one-off paycheck.Jean(Mulligan) his ex is pregnant,she castigates him as an a**hole(which he is) but you sympathise with his plight. Jean is always screaming at him.He's homeless,penniless,only human,struggling with commercial pressures to express his art,pondering whether to give it up and go to sea.The trip to Chicago to meet a new manager(his old one doesn't pay) is a masterstroke.Jazzman Roland Turner(John Goodman) and his silent driver sidekick accompany him.Goodman chews the scenery as a sleepy,drug-addicted, head-banger, putting a hex on his life(as if needed).There are depressing scenes in the Gaslight Caf&eacute;.Strugglingto make it as a musician,against insurmountable obstacles,some of his own making.His sister throws all hisbelongings out, so he can't go back to sea.He arranges an abortion for Jean.His music combines innocence and old age,he will miss the boat as his talent is not quite good enough,he's half in love with failure. At the end, he sings his songwith the line ""fare thee well"" and then Dylan comes up and does his own ""fare thee well"" number that is a work of genius.

1679226,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B00GMV8KGW,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[9, 12]","Joel and Ethan Coen are among the quirkiest of mainstream filmmakers. Their films often hit just the right note of bizarreness to offer  richly textured characters and oddball plots. They definitely march to their own drummer and have, for years, defied traditional thinking about what a feature film should be.""Inside Llewyn Davis"" is their latest film, which takes place in 1961 and focuses on the Greenwich Village folk music revival that was at its peak before Bob Dylan entered the scene and shook up traditional folk with a new sound, blending blues, folk and rock.Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac) is thoroughly embedded in that scene. We meet him after a partnership has broken up due to tragedy and he's been forced to go it as a solo. But things arent going that well. He has no permanent home, crashing for days at a time here and there, with any kind soul who has an empty couch to offer. His frequent gigs at the Gaslight Cafe have failed to draw critical attention, his solo album is selling poorly, he's gotten Jean (Carey Mulligan), the wife of a friend, pregnant, he has no coat, and he's responsible for letting the pet cat of one of his hosts escape. Life looks bleak.Llewyn seems locked into a routine that only offers him disappointment, disillusionment, and stagnation. It's as if life is dragging him into an ever-widening abyss.The Coens are not the types to present a completely depressing film, so it is filled with interesting little episodes, colorful characters, and vignettes that capture an early 60's vibe. Folk music was sometimes rooted in man's struggles, but could be woefully pretentious as well. Llewyn is serious about his music, but makes a lot of decisions that stunt his career.When he gets a studio gig as second guitarist accompanying friend Jim (Justin Timberlake), it's for a dopey novelty song filled with topical references called ""Please Mr. Kennedy,"" as far from folk music as you can get, but with an insistent beat and funny lyrics that make it the kind of song that just might become a hit. Llewyn looks on this not as a tremendous opportunity, but as a chance to pick up some quick bucks. Labeling Llewyn self-destructive may be too easy. He's more complex than that, and it's that complexity that draws us in.One of his biggest problems is connecting with an audience. He doesn't have boyish good looks or on-stage charm. A fellow who crosses his path, Troy Nelson (Stark Sands), is a marked contrast to Llewyn -- self-effacing, handsome, and talented. Llewyn watches opportunities pass him by as others succeed, failing to look within himself to discover the cause.Mr. Isaac, a graduate of New York City's Juilliard School, performs all his own songs and handles the dramatic scenes effectively despite a fairly skimpy acting resume. His performance incorporates arrogance, anger, frustration, disdain, bitterness, and resignation.Often in movies, music is heard in pieces rather than as a whole, so that dialogue can be interspersed and pace kept brisk. ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" departs from that convention by allowing full songs to be performed. And it's during these performances that we see that Llewyn has real talent and that he could be successful were it not for his ability to disrupt his own life and the lives of those with whom he comes in contact. So his tragic flaw, if you will, is his own onerynees.The movie is akin to a day in the life of Llewyn Davis, though the events depicted cover a greater time span. The Coens present an assortment of characters who interact with Llewyn in different ways, ranging from the vituperative venom pouring from Jean's mouth to the painfully candid assessment of his singing by record promoter Bud Grossman (F. Murray Abraham) to a rambling tirade by jazz musician Roland Turner (John Goodman).Rated R, ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" is a character study of a not very enviable person. Mr. Isaac manages to have us care about Llewyn as the Coen Brothers magnify his unremarkable life for the cameras, enlivening a 50-year-old era vividly.Both the Blu-ray and DVD editions contain the behind-the-scenes featurette, ""Inside Inside Llewyn Davis,"" containing interviews with Oscar Isaac, Joan Baez, Patti Smith, Justin Timberlake, Carey Mulligan, and Joel and Ethan Coen.",3,Personal Look at the 1960's New York Folk Scene,1395446400,"03 22, 2014",2014,4257,"['Joel', 'Ethan', 'Coen', 'are', 'quirkiest', 'mainstream', 'filmmakers', 'films', 'often', 'hit', 'just', 'right', 'note', 'bizarreness', 'offer', 'richly', 'textured', 'characters', 'oddball', 'plots', 'definitely', 'march', 'own', 'drummer', 'have', 'years', 'defied', 'traditional', 'thinking', 'what', 'feature', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'Llewyn', 'Davis', 'latest', 'film', 'place', '1961', 'Greenwich', 'Village', 'folk', 'music', 'revival', 'was', 'peak', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'entered', 'scene', 'shook', 'up', 'traditional', 'folk', 'new', 'sound', 'blending', 'blues', 'folk', 'rock.Llewyn', 'Davis', 'Oscar', 'Isaac', 'thoroughly', 'embedded', 'scene', 'meet', 'partnership', 'broken', 'up', 'due', 'tragedy', 'been', 'forced', 'go', 'solo', 'things', 'arent', 'going', 'well', 'permanent', 'home', 'crashing', 'days', 'time', 'here', 'there', 'kind', 'soul', 'who', 'empty', 'couch', 'offer', 'frequent', 'gigs', 'Gaslight', 'Cafe', 'have', 'failed', 'draw', 'critical', 'attention', 'solo', 'album', 'selling', 'poorly', 'gotten', 'Jean', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'wife', 'friend', 'pregnant', 'coat', 'responsible', 'letting', 'pet', 'cat', 'one', 'hosts', 'escape', 'Life', 'bleak.Llewyn', 'locked', 'routine', 'only', 'disappointment', 'disillusionment', 'stagnation', 'life', 'dragging', 'ever-widening', 'abyss.The', 'Coens', 'are', 'not', 'types', 'present', 'completely', 'depressing', 'film', 'filled', 'interesting', 'little', 'episodes', 'colorful', 'characters', 'capture', 'early', '60', 'vibe', 'Folk', 'music', 'was', 'sometimes', 'rooted', 'man', 'struggles', 'could', 'be', 'woefully', 'pretentious', 'well', 'Llewyn', 'serious', 'music', 'lot', 'decisions', 'stunt', 'career.When', 'studio', 'gig', 'second', 'guitarist', 'accompanying', 'friend', 'Jim', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', 'dopey', 'novelty', 'song', 'filled', 'topical', 'references', 'called', 'Please', 'Mr.', 'Kennedy', 'far', 'folk', 'music', 'can', 'get', 'insistent', 'beat', 'funny', 'lyrics', 'make', 'kind', 'song', 'just', 'might', 'become', 'hit', 'Llewyn', 'not', 'tremendous', 'opportunity', 'chance', 'pick', 'up', 'quick', 'bucks', 'Labeling', 'Llewyn', 'self-destructive', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'easy', 'more', 'complex', 'complexity', 'in.One', 'biggest', 'problems', 'connecting', 'audience', ""n't"", 'have', 'boyish', 'good', 'looks', 'on-stage', 'charm', 'fellow', 'who', 'path', 'Troy', 'Nelson', 'Stark', 'Sands', 'marked', 'contrast', 'Llewyn', 'self-effacing', 'handsome', 'talented', 'Llewyn', 'opportunities', 'pass', 'others', 'succeed', 'failing', 'look', 'discover', 'cause.Mr', 'Isaac', 'graduate', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Juilliard', 'School', 'own', 'songs', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'effectively', 'fairly', 'skimpy', 'acting', 'resume', 'performance', 'arrogance', 'anger', 'frustration', 'disdain', 'bitterness', 'resignation.Often', 'movies', 'music', 'heard', 'pieces', 'rather', 'whole', 'dialogue', 'can', 'be', 'interspersed', 'pace', 'kept', 'brisk', 'Llewyn', 'Davis', 'departs', 'convention', 'allowing', 'full', 'songs', 'be', 'performed', 'performances', 'see', 'Llewyn', 'real', 'talent', 'could', 'be', 'successful', 'were', 'not', 'ability', 'disrupt', 'own', 'life', 'lives', 'whom', 'contact', 'tragic', 'flaw', 'will', 'own', 'onerynees.The', 'movie', 'akin', 'day', 'life', 'Llewyn', 'Davis', 'events', 'depicted', 'cover', 'greater', 'time', 'span', 'Coens', 'present', 'assortment', 'characters', 'who', 'interact', 'Llewyn', 'different', 'ways', 'ranging', 'vituperative', 'venom', 'pouring', 'Jean', 'mouth', 'painfully', 'candid', 'assessment', 'singing', 'record', 'promoter', 'Bud', 'Grossman', 'F.', 'Murray', 'Abraham', 'rambling', 'tirade', 'jazz', 'musician', 'Roland', 'Turner', 'John', 'Goodman', '.Rated', 'R', 'Llewyn', 'Davis', 'character', 'study', 'not', 'very', 'enviable', 'person', 'Mr.', 'Isaac', 'have', 'care', 'about', 'Llewyn', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'magnify', 'unremarkable', 'life', 'cameras', 'enlivening', '50-year-old', 'era', 'Blu-ray', 'DVD', 'editions', 'contain', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurette', 'Inside', 'Inside', 'Llewyn', 'Davis', 'containing', 'interviews', 'Oscar', 'Isaac', 'Joan', 'Baez', 'Patti', 'Smith', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'Joel', 'Ethan', 'Coen']",Inside Llewyn Davis

What I don't get is why try and make him so unlikeable even the part where he leaves the abandon car he also leaves the cat if he had taken the cat i might've given this 4 stars because it meant he had good intentions.  Now in the movie he did show some good intentions and maybe he had integrity but they didn't show that enough.  What was the reason behind not wanting to join a folk group when offered by Dylan's ex-manager...we know why but it wasn't clear enough.  Also they didn't really reveal even a decent personality, I've seen Dave Von Ronk perform and he did tell charming stories and he did little side acts that were funny like he'd go into his pouch looking and looking for guitar picks.  Plus the movie was very dark and the audio was very low for the most part.  I just didn't get the movie and why it was done this way.  Personally i would've had alot alot of shots of the village because it's an endearing place as it is.  Musicially they did a pretty good job but they could've done better.  You had to have a fake dylan even a small part the part where he sang a few lines of an unreleased song wasn't enough.  You also don't get enough of a camadrie of the folk singers, I know the Tom Paxton character was there in the military guy who slept on the couch while the Dave character slept on the floor by orders of the semi-girlfriend who hated his guts but didn't stop her from making love to him on that dreadful night.  I get he wasn't the perfect human being or a saint by any means...but maybe that was the point...it seems alot of people are really mixed on this, personally i never saw such an even mixture of 1 to 5 star reviews ever before...usaully it's lopsided...I will watch it again because maybe i took the movie too seriously maybe that wasn't the intent to take it seriously.",3,Didn't get the meaning of the movie or is that the point?,1397433600,"04 14, 2014",2014,2041,"['most', 'likely', 'Dave', 'Von', 'Ronk', 'story', 'saying', 'did', 'see', 'Dave', 'Von', 'Ronk', 'village', 'stepped', 'foot', 'once', 'always', 'had', 'wife', 'show', 'did', 'bring', 'cat', 'shows', 'true', 'part', 'What', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'why', 'try', 'make', 'so', 'unlikeable', 'even', 'part', 'where', 'abandon', 'car', 'also', 'cat', 'had', 'taken', 'cat', 'i', 'might', ""'ve"", 'given', '4', 'stars', 'meant', 'had', 'good', 'intentions', 'Now', 'movie', 'did', 'show', 'good', 'intentions', 'maybe', 'had', 'integrity', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'enough', 'What', 'was', 'reason', 'not', 'wanting', 'join', 'folk', 'group', 'when', 'offered', 'Dylan', 'ex-manager', 'know', 'why', 'was', ""n't"", 'clear', 'enough', 'Also', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'reveal', 'even', 'decent', 'personality', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Dave', 'Von', 'Ronk', 'perform', 'did', 'tell', 'charming', 'stories', 'did', 'little', 'side', 'acts', 'were', 'funny', ""'d"", 'go', 'pouch', 'looking', 'looking', 'guitar', 'picks', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'dark', 'audio', 'was', 'very', 'low', 'most', 'part', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'movie', 'why', 'was', 'done', 'way', 'Personally', 'i', 'would', ""'ve"", 'had', 'alot', 'alot', 'shots', 'village', 'endearing', 'place', 'Musicially', 'did', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'could', ""'ve"", 'done', 'better', 'had', 'have', 'fake', 'dylan', 'even', 'small', 'part', 'part', 'where', 'sang', 'few', 'lines', 'unreleased', 'song', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'camadrie', 'folk', 'singers', 'know', 'Tom', 'Paxton', 'character', 'was', 'there', 'military', 'guy', 'who', 'slept', 'couch', 'Dave', 'character', 'slept', 'floor', 'orders', 'semi-girlfriend', 'who', 'hated', 'guts', 'did', ""n't"", 'stop', 'making', 'love', 'dreadful', 'night', 'get', 'was', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'human', 'being', 'saint', 'means', 'maybe', 'was', 'point', 'alot', 'people', 'are', 'really', 'mixed', 'personally', 'i', 'never', 'saw', 'such', 'even', 'mixture', '1', '5', 'star', 'reviews', 'ever', 'usaully', 'lopsided', 'will', 'watch', 'again', 'maybe', 'i', 'took', 'movie', 'too', 'seriously', 'maybe', 'was', ""n't"", 'intent', 'take', 'seriously']",Inside Llewyn Davis
1679228,AJYGQV81FSFE2,B00GMV8KGW,Timothy P. Scanlon,"[2, 9]","Full disclosure: Ethan and Joel Coen are among the best living filmmakers, up there with Woody Allen. So, to any of their films, I look forward.In the case of this one, I was so confident I'd see the film that I bought the soundtrack before seeing the movie.In any case, it's based on part of the life of 1960s folky Dave Van Ronk. So, before seeing the movie, I also looked him up on Wikipedia. (Sorry, Rand Paul. For this it works!) Yeah there was some resemblance. While watching it I realized that the resemblance to Van Ronk's life is how the life of Strickland, the main character in W. Somerset Maugham'sThe Moon and Sixpence (Dover Value Editions)is related to that of Paul Guagin, the artist.Davis was living from one friend's sofa to the next. He got into some trouble when he found out that one of his flames,  Jean, (Carey Mulligan) was pregnant. Her character was hysterical. She didn't run short of expletives for Llewyn, probably the reason the film was given an R rating.One of the lead characters is a cat, or, rather, two of them. (I won't give away too much on that). But it reminded me of a little of I think it wasMeet the Parentswith Ben Stiller. That cat added a little spice to the script which might have been drier with him--and her.There was also some resemblance of the filmThe Commitmentsthat parable of a couple of decades ago about an Irish soul band trying to find an identity and place within the music scene of that time in that city (Dublin in the older film, New York's Greenwich Village in this one).I mention the ""circle,"" because what seems trendy in Hollywood these days--it works, but can get tiring--is the script returning to an earlier time, then back to where you are, then back again. This one ended in essentially the same place in started. But in the meantime, Davis went to Chicago, through some interesting travel experiences. Then back to New York.It seems that that's reasonably accurate about Van Ronk who was as attached to New York as Woody Allen used to be.One of the finest assets of the film was the acting.  Davis (Oscar Isaac) is an actor with whom I wasn't familiar. He was outstanding, truly awards material. I wasn't as impressed with Carey Mulligan. I mean, she was okay, but not as outstanding as Isaac.The Coen's have a talent for picking out the perfect face for their characters. The ones who stood out were Al Cody (Adam Driver) whose address was on a letter in the film, and since when I was in early grade school, I recognized the area! He, anyway, was a would-be folk singer given the idiosyncratic vocal part in a song written by Jim (Justin Timberlake).When the character Mitch Gorfien (Ethan Phillips) appeared, I struggled with where I'd seen him before. Then I remembered: he was Neelix, on Star Trek Voyager. And the guests that they had at their place were standard Coen brothers' fare: your ""average Joe"" in caricature. And it's a talent the Coen's have to choose their characters that give them the special punch they have.Then there was Johnny Five, the driver of Roland Turner (John Goodman). I thought at first that it was Brad Pitt, but wondered why he would take such a minor role. It turned out it was Garret Hedlund with whom I wasn't familiar. He was actually an interesting character, as vociferous as Gaear Grimsrud, Peter Stormare's character in the Coen brothers' ""Fargo.""Then there was Troy (Stark Sands), the army character and friend of Jean. Just another sample of the Coen's writing in colorful characters--notorious for their ordinariness--into their scripts. (One of Llewyn's lines after seeing Troy sing had me in stitches. It was something like, ""Is he capable of higher functions""?By the way, no offense to John Goodman who I think is a superb actor. But his character didn't add that much to the script. In fact, Johnny Five's almost added more, including the weird situation in which the police hauled him off.And the set! Where did they get all those 1950s vehicles and designs? Brilliant.There's so much more I want to say but I only have so much space here.  Again, the acting is outstanding, the casting is amazing(Thanks, Ethan and Joel). And the soundtrack: Well, it just started now on my CD player--following the three CDs of the Everley brothers one of whom died yesterday...It wasn't a blockbuster--thank heaven. But it's a great story, evoking memories of an era long gone. And I liked it to the point that I'll probably purchase the Dave Van Ronk CDs from Amazon!",4,The story line is a circle...,1388793600,"01 4, 2014",2014,4480,"['Full', 'disclosure', 'Ethan', 'Joel', 'Coen', 'are', 'best', 'living', 'filmmakers', 'up', 'there', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'So', 'films', 'look', 'forward.In', 'case', 'one', 'was', 'so', 'confident', ""'d"", 'see', 'film', 'bought', 'soundtrack', 'seeing', 'movie.In', 'case', 'based', 'part', 'life', '1960s', 'folky', 'Dave', 'Van', 'Ronk', 'So', 'seeing', 'movie', 'also', 'looked', 'up', 'Wikipedia', 'Sorry', 'Rand', 'Paul', 'Yeah', 'was', 'resemblance', 'watching', 'realized', 'resemblance', 'Van', 'Ronk', 'life', 'how', 'life', 'Strickland', 'main', 'character', 'W.', 'Somerset', ""Maugham'sThe"", 'Moon', 'Sixpence', 'Dover', 'Value', 'Editions', 'related', 'Paul', 'Guagin', 'artist.Davis', 'was', 'living', 'one', 'friend', 'sofa', 'next', 'got', 'trouble', 'when', 'found', 'out', 'one', 'flames', 'Jean', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'was', 'pregnant', 'character', 'was', 'hysterical', 'did', ""n't"", 'run', 'short', 'expletives', 'Llewyn', 'probably', 'reason', 'film', 'was', 'given', 'R', 'rating.One', 'lead', 'characters', 'cat', 'rather', 'two', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'reminded', 'little', 'think', 'Parentswith', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'cat', 'added', 'little', 'spice', 'script', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'drier', 'her.There', 'was', 'also', 'resemblance', 'filmThe', 'Commitmentsthat', 'parable', 'couple', 'decades', 'Irish', 'soul', 'band', 'trying', 'find', 'identity', 'place', 'music', 'scene', 'time', 'city', 'Dublin', 'older', 'film', 'New', 'York', 'Greenwich', 'Village', 'one', 'mention', 'circle', 'what', 'trendy', 'Hollywood', 'days', 'can', 'get', 'tiring', 'script', 'returning', 'earlier', 'time', 'then', 'back', 'where', 'are', 'then', 'back', 'again', 'one', 'ended', 'essentially', 'same', 'place', 'started', 'meantime', 'Davis', 'went', 'Chicago', 'interesting', 'travel', 'experiences', 'Then', 'back', 'New', 'York.It', 'reasonably', 'accurate', 'Van', 'Ronk', 'who', 'was', 'as', 'attached', 'New', 'York', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'used', 'be.One', 'finest', 'assets', 'film', 'was', 'acting', 'Davis', 'Oscar', 'Isaac', 'actor', 'whom', 'was', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'was', 'outstanding', 'truly', 'awards', 'material', 'was', ""n't"", 'impressed', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'mean', 'was', 'okay', 'not', 'as', 'outstanding', 'Isaac.The', 'Coen', 'have', 'talent', 'picking', 'out', 'perfect', 'face', 'characters', 'ones', 'who', 'stood', 'out', 'were', 'Al', 'Cody', 'Adam', 'Driver', 'address', 'was', 'letter', 'film', 'when', 'was', 'early', 'grade', 'school', 'recognized', 'area', 'anyway', 'was', 'would-be', 'folk', 'singer', 'given', 'idiosyncratic', 'vocal', 'part', 'song', 'written', 'Jim', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', '.When', 'character', 'Mitch', 'Gorfien', 'Ethan', 'Phillips', 'appeared', 'struggled', 'where', ""'d"", 'seen', 'before', 'Then', 'remembered', 'was', 'Neelix', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Voyager', 'guests', 'had', 'place', 'were', 'standard', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'fare', 'average', 'Joe', 'caricature', 'talent', 'Coen', 'have', 'choose', 'characters', 'give', 'special', 'punch', 'have.Then', 'was', 'Johnny', 'Five', 'driver', 'Roland', 'Turner', 'John', 'Goodman', 'thought', 'first', 'was', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'wondered', 'why', 'would', 'take', 'such', 'minor', 'role', 'turned', 'out', 'was', 'Garret', 'Hedlund', 'whom', 'was', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'was', 'actually', 'interesting', 'character', 'as', 'vociferous', 'Gaear', 'Grimsrud', 'Peter', 'Stormare', 'character', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'Fargo', 'Then', 'was', 'Troy', 'Stark', 'Sands', 'army', 'character', 'friend', 'Jean', 'Just', 'sample', 'Coen', 'writing', 'colorful', 'characters', 'notorious', 'ordinariness', 'scripts', 'One', 'Llewyn', 'lines', 'seeing', 'Troy', 'sing', 'had', 'stitches', 'was', 'something', 'capable', 'higher', 'functions', 'way', 'offense', 'John', 'Goodman', 'who', 'think', 'superb', 'actor', 'character', 'did', ""n't"", 'add', 'that', 'much', 'script', 'fact', 'Johnny', 'Five', 'almost', 'added', 'more', 'including', 'weird', 'situation', 'police', 'hauled', 'off.And', 'set', 'Where', 'did', 'get', '1950s', 'vehicles', 'designs', 'Brilliant.There', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'want', 'say', 'only', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'space', 'here', 'Again', 'acting', 'outstanding', 'casting', 'amazing', 'Thanks', 'Ethan', 'Joel', 'soundtrack', 'Well', 'just', 'started', 'now', 'CD', 'player', 'following', 'three', 'CDs', 'Everley', 'brothers', 'one', 'whom', 'died', 'yesterday', 'was', ""n't"", 'blockbuster', 'thank', 'heaven', 'great', 'story', 'evoking', 'memories', 'era', 'long', 'gone', 'liked', 'point', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'purchase', 'Dave', 'Van', 'Ronk', 'CDs', 'Amazon']",Inside Llewyn Davis

1679234,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00GMV8KGW,Turfseer,"[6, 20]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***The problem with the Coen Brothers is that in every one of their movies, they're looking through a glass half empty and never half full. 'Inside Llewyn Davis' is no exception. Oh yes, you'll find the usual excellent cinematography, casting, acting, direction and neat recreation of bygone eras. But what you'll never find is sympathy for your protagonist. The Coen Brothers always pride themselves on standing above the fray and looking down on their anti-heroes. In essence, what they're saying is, 'we're good at exposing the underbelly of the dark side of Americana; applaud us.'The failed folk artist, Llewyn Davis, is prototypical of their one dimensional view of things. Are there really people like the fictional Davis (supposedly an amalgam of real life musicians including Dave Van Ronk, Phil Ochs and Ramblin' Jack Elliott)? People so clueless, so narcissistic, that they never listen to feedback from anyone else, so that they never change. It's a rare individual who is so misanthropic, like the Coens' Llewyn, that you will ever run into him, in real life. But even if there is such a character, does he really deserve to be immortalized in film? I hardly think so.The Coen brothers had no problem in admitting that 'Inside Llewyn Davis' has little plot. More important is the fact that the story is devoid of a concrete antagonist. The only antagonist is Llewyn's internal demon-- which takes the form of myopia, cluelessness, and narcissism. The demon never emerges into Llewyn's consciousness, so that perhaps he can reflect upon where he is going wrong. Instead, we're asked to sit through a 104 minute chronicle of an unlikeable mediocrity, who pursues a wrong-headed quest for fame and fortune in the folk music world of the early 60s.Llewyn Davis is much more caricature than a real human being. The Coen brothers go out of their way to show just how much of a loser this guy is. Are there really people like this? Consider their catalogue of Llewyn's shortcomings: He originally was part of a Simon & Garfunkel precursor type group, Tom & Jerry, but his partner committed suicide; he has no money and sleeps on acquaintances' couches; he's forced to carry some friends' cat around with him after he locks himself out of their apartment; he impregnates a woman but doesn't have to pay for the abortion, after he learns from the abortion doctor, that a previous girlfriend, never went through with the procedure; he drives all the way to Chicago, only to learn that a music manager never received his latest record in the mail and doesn't think he has any commercial potential; he heckles a woman during a folk concert and is later beaten up badly by the woman's husband, outside in a dark alley.'Inside Llewyn Davis' is the ultimate sad sack tale. And unfortunately, sad sacks never make for good drama. What the film does have is lots of atmosphere. There are some neat cinematic scenes, notably the one involving John Goodman as a sleazy, heroin-addicted jazz musician, who is a passenger along with Llewyn, on that trip to Chicago. I also liked the attempt to recreate NYC in 1961, particularly various streets in Greenwich Village.Rather than consulting all the positive reviews from 'professional' critics on Metacritic, you'll find some much more honest and insightful reviews in the review section of IMDb.

1679237,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B00GMV8KGW,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[13, 22]","The one thing one can always expect from a Coen Brothers film is that it will be interesting.  And Inside Llewyn Davis does deliver in that aspect at least.  But that said, when it was all over, I was left wondering what the point was.  As a Coen Brothers fan, I think it's worth seeing.  But that said, it's not one that I think I'll ever want to see again, let alone keep in my collection.The film is set in February of 1961 in New York City's Greenwich Village when the folk music scene was just beginning to take hold there.  Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac) is a struggling folk singer trying to make a name for himself but not doing very well at it.  The reasons for his lack of success are many and varied, but top of the list is the fact that his singing partner, Mike (sung by Marcus Mumford), committed suicide about a year earlier. The album that they did together - If We Had Wings - had what seems to be a modest success, but Llewyn's recent solo album - Inside Llewyn Davis - isn't selling at all and people aren't exactly lining up to offer him gigs at any of the clubs.  As a result, he has no money and is sleeping on the couches of friends and acquaintances, rotating his way through them like a migrant guest as he drifts about ever in search of work, his welcome becoming steadily thinner with each cycle.As the film progresses, you begin to see that a lot of Llewyn's problems are self-inflicted. He doesn't think things through, frequently makes bad decisions, is not the most considerate person on the best of days and generally rubs people the wrong way, especially when he opens his mouth. This might all be overlooked if he were a major talent, but even there he seems to be lacking as it gradually becomes obvious that the only songs people seem to want to hear him sing are the ones he did with his partner Mike.  Add to all this the fact that he's increasingly bitter and resentful towards pretty much everyone in general, blames everyone but himself for his failures and yet keeps expecting people to help him out.In fact, there are not a whole lot of likeable people in this movie.  Some of them are interesting - like John Goodman's Roland Turner, a pompous and aggressively annoying jazz musician who staggers about like a drug-addicted Orson Welles, and Garret Hedlund's Johnny Five, a muttering beat poet acting as Turner's chauffeur, who Llewyn ends up sharing a ride to Chicago with in a desperate attempt to see if he can attract the interest of impresario Bud Grossman (F. Murray Abraham) who has a major club there. About the only characters who are in any way likeable are Llewyn's friend Jim (Justin Timberlake) at whose apartment he crashes and a guest of Jim's named Troy Nelson (Stark Sands), a painfully clean-cut and earnest young soldier trying to break into the folk music scene.  But in many ways Jim and Troy are too nice to be really believable and only seem to be there to make the unpleasant characters even more unpleasant by contrast. In truth, it says something about Inside Llewyn Davis that the only genuinely sympathetic character in the film is a cat.In the end though my biggest problem with Inside Llewyn Davis is that when the film ends, nothing has changed.  Llewyn is still exactly the same as he was at the beginning of the film, as is everyone else, making you wonder what the point of the film was.  Why did we follow the life of this somewhat pitiable but mostly unlikeable character for a week which seems to have made no difference for better or worse in the man himself?To be fair, Oscar Isaac (Won't Back Down, Sucker Punch) does a marvelous job of bringing out the complexity of Llewyn Davis as a character, even if the character isn't a particularly admirable or likeable one. He's already been nominated for a number of critics' awards and will likely be getting an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor for his portrayal. And Inside Llweyn Davis won the Jury Prize at Cannes last year and has also picked up a number of nominations in various categories for other awards including the Golden Globes.  So there is something there that critics at least are responding to. It just didn't work all that well for me as an individual.Recommended for fans of the Coen Brothers, and for Oscar Isaac's performance, but not much else.",3,"An interesting film, but after it's done one wonders what the point was",1388880000,"01 5, 2014",2014,4298,"['one', 'thing', 'one', 'can', 'always', 'expect', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'interesting', 'Inside', 'Llewyn', 'Davis', 'deliver', 'aspect', 'least', 'said', 'when', 'was', 'was', 'left', 'wondering', 'what', 'point', 'was', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'fan', 'think', 'worth', 'seeing', 'said', 'not', 'one', 'think', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'want', 'see', 'again', 'let', 'alone', 'keep', 'collection.The', 'film', 'set', 'February', '1961', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Greenwich', 'Village', 'when', 'folk', 'music', 'scene', 'was', 'just', 'beginning', 'take', 'hold', 'there', 'Llewyn', 'Davis', 'Oscar', 'Isaac', 'struggling', 'folk', 'singer', 'trying', 'make', 'name', 'not', 'doing', 'very', 'well', 'reasons', 'lack', 'success', 'are', 'many', 'varied', 'top', 'list', 'fact', 'singing', 'partner', 'Mike', 'sung', 'Marcus', 'Mumford', 'committed', 'suicide', 'year', 'earlier', 'album', 'did', 'together', 'Had', 'Wings', 'had', 'what', 'be', 'modest', 'success', 'Llewyn', 'recent', 'solo', 'album', 'Llewyn', 'Davis', ""n't"", 'selling', 'people', 'are', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'lining', 'up', 'offer', 'gigs', 'clubs', 'result', 'money', 'sleeping', 'couches', 'friends', 'acquaintances', 'rotating', 'way', 'migrant', 'guest', 'ever', 'search', 'work', 'welcome', 'becoming', 'steadily', 'thinner', 'cycle.As', 'film', 'begin', 'see', 'lot', 'Llewyn', 'problems', 'are', 'self-inflicted', ""n't"", 'think', 'things', 'frequently', 'bad', 'decisions', 'not', 'most', 'considerate', 'person', 'best', 'days', 'generally', 'rubs', 'people', 'wrong', 'way', 'especially', 'when', 'mouth', 'might', 'be', 'overlooked', 'were', 'major', 'talent', 'even', 'be', 'lacking', 'gradually', 'obvious', 'only', 'songs', 'people', 'seem', 'want', 'hear', 'sing', 'are', 'ones', 'did', 'partner', 'Mike', 'Add', 'all', 'fact', 'increasingly', 'bitter', 'resentful', 'towards', 'pretty', 'much', 'everyone', 'general', 'everyone', 'failures', 'yet', 'keeps', 'expecting', 'people', 'help', 'out.In', 'fact', 'are', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'likeable', 'people', 'movie', 'are', 'interesting', 'John', 'Goodman', 'Roland', 'Turner', 'pompous', 'aggressively', 'annoying', 'jazz', 'musician', 'who', 'drug-addicted', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'Garret', 'Hedlund', 'Johnny', 'Five', 'muttering', 'beat', 'poet', 'acting', 'Turner', 'chauffeur', 'who', 'Llewyn', 'up', 'sharing', 'ride', 'Chicago', 'desperate', 'attempt', 'see', 'can', 'attract', 'interest', 'impresario', 'Bud', 'Grossman', 'F.', 'Murray', 'Abraham', 'who', 'major', 'club', 'there', 'only', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'way', 'likeable', 'are', 'Llewyn', 'friend', 'Jim', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', 'apartment', 'guest', 'Jim', 'named', 'Troy', 'Nelson', 'Stark', 'Sands', 'painfully', 'clean-cut', 'earnest', 'young', 'soldier', 'trying', 'break', 'folk', 'music', 'scene', 'many', 'ways', 'Jim', 'Troy', 'are', 'too', 'nice', 'be', 'really', 'believable', 'only', 'seem', 'be', 'there', 'make', 'unpleasant', 'characters', 'even', 'more', 'unpleasant', 'contrast', 'truth', 'something', 'Inside', 'Llewyn', 'Davis', 'only', 'genuinely', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'film', 'cat.In', 'end', 'biggest', 'problem', 'Inside', 'Llewyn', 'Davis', 'when', 'film', 'nothing', 'changed', 'Llewyn', 'still', 'exactly', 'same', 'was', 'beginning', 'film', 'everyone', 'else', 'making', 'wonder', 'what', 'point', 'film', 'was', 'Why', 'did', 'follow', 'life', 'somewhat', 'pitiable', 'mostly', 'unlikeable', 'character', 'week', 'have', 'made', 'difference', 'better', 'worse', 'man', 'be', 'fair', 'Oscar', 'Isaac', 'Wo', ""n't"", 'Back', 'Down', 'Sucker', 'Punch', 'marvelous', 'job', 'bringing', 'out', 'complexity', 'Llewyn', 'Davis', 'character', 'even', 'character', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'admirable', 'likeable', 'one', 'already', 'been', 'nominated', 'number', 'critics', 'awards', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'getting', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Actor', 'portrayal', 'Inside', 'Llweyn', 'Davis', 'won', 'Jury', 'Prize', 'Cannes', 'last', 'year', 'also', 'picked', 'up', 'number', 'nominations', 'various', 'categories', 'other', 'awards', 'including', 'Golden', 'Globes', 'So', 'something', 'there', 'critics', 'least', 'are', 'responding', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'well', 'individual.Recommended', 'fans', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'Oscar', 'Isaac', 'performance', 'not', 'much', 'else']",Inside Llewyn Davis

I don't dispute that - it's your business what you like. It's not Raising Arizona or Fargo or Oh Brother; it's nonetheless excellent.April 16 - A month (roughly) later. I've seen it twice more. This is a remarkable piece of work. It achieves - in its soundtrack - an amazing degree of verisimilitude. The construction of the novelty song, Please Mr. Kennedy, which is exactly the sort of song that would be a ""folk"" hit, is sufficiently well-wrought that, had that been the ONLY song in the movie, I'd have been impressed. But there are many others, each one of a stripe that tells precisely who the character performing the song is. There are the ""pretty,"" popular songs performed by the light-weights, and the ""genuine,"" true to form songs performed by Lllewyn. So much thought went into the music that I'm blown away, but then it is T Bone Burnett, from whom I'd expect nothing less.Also of interest is the timeline, which is one of the cleverest I've seen. The movie is like a mobius strip; it begins and ends with minute variations of the same scene, one in which the cat gets out and one in which he doesn't. The movie is about ALMOST making it, as if to say that there's just a hair's breadth (cat gets out, cat doesn't get out) between making it and not. Llewyn performs on a hit record, but needs his money right now, and so declines his royalties. Bud Grossman (think Albert Grossman)offers him a chance to sing with another guy and a girl if he'll sing harmonies, trim his beard back to a goatee, and stay out of the sun. That describes exactly a group that DID make it: Peter, Paul and Mary. His first/last performance he's sharing the basket with guess who (HINT: it's a nasal guy who sings Fare Thee Well). So he's forever just missing the boat (literally and figuratively). Not only that, but he's ALMOST a good guy. His performances are heart-felt, quality affairs, but in real life his act is not so good. He ALMOST cares for the cat. He loves Jenny, but can't quite be nice to her; consequently, she has long since stopped being nice to him. The Gorfeins adore him, but he isn't consistently polite, to say nothing of nice, to them either.So, does he deserve not to succeeed, or is he just unlucky? I think that's the real point.
