The story centers around two best friends on an Indian Reservation in Canada.  They want to go to a school in a big city to become mechanics but don't seem in any particular rush to accomplish this.  The movie is part comedy but not entirely as viewers will find out for themselves upon watching.  The ending was a bit of a surprise.  I don't want to ruin the movie so will stop here.

403685,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,6304137168,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 0]","Surprising film indeed! It is Canadian and that is quite visible. Yet, that film tells a few disquieting things.The first one is that we have teenagers, both boys and girls, a couple of mothers but NO fathers. That is surprising because I have never seen anywhere this idea that the Indian family was mother-centered with an absentee father, or are we to understand all fathers are in prison? This is of course very important since then the boys as well as the girls grow without the authority and the role model of a father. The result is thus going to be great fuzziness among boys as well as girls about what the heritage of the tribe, of the Indian culture may be, and that produces adults that are rootless.The second thing is that they speak of a reservation but it is surprisingly not closed. Apart from the few half derelict buildings that are the homes of Indian fatherless families, some kind of cheap prefabs more than real houses, we see no Indian institution or Indian mark anywhere in this reservation. Is that the Canadian model? I have read a lot about Indian in French speaking Quebec. Here we are in English speaking Canada. But what I see does not correspond to what I have read on the Quebec side about the integration of Indians and the respect that is due to their traditions and cultures.The third element is that there is a police, a ""tribal"" police mind you, all white and particularly anti-Indian not to say racist. An Indian girl is assassinated by a white man. He gets a two year sentence for it and even so he is apparently free one week later. Canadian justice indeed! Why not? But that is surprising.The Indians want to take justice in their own hands. The boys are planning the assassination of this white murderer. They fail and yet the chap gets killed with a knife, his throat is slit. At once the ""tribal"" police captures all the male Indians, make them undress down to their shorts, we can imagine they may even have gone further, at least we saw them kicked out of the ""tribal"" police station in their boxer's shorts and barefoot. The ""tribal"" police will never be able to prove who did it, certainly not the Indian boys they brought in and detained. Is that what the police is in a reservation? The definition of reservation has little to do with what I know on the US side. We are here dealing with nothing but some colonial repressive uniform-wearing white militia.Hope is in the end of the film, but a very bitter hope. The white murderer was killed by an Indian girl, alone, probably by approaching him sexually to get close enough. The main teenager, Silas, makes her burn her clothing when he reaches their prefab. But that is not justice and that is a shame Canada does not have a judicial system that should be equal for all.The second hopeful element is that Silas and his closest friend are accepted in the car-mechanics school, which means he moves away for a year or so and goes to the white city close to the reservation. They might get some qualification that could mean a job. But their education is far from being a priority in Canada. And what about girls? Nothing visible here.In one word then the picture is bleak and the story is squalid. If that is the fate of Indians in Canada today, and the film is rather recent, 1994, it does not reflect at all the great evolution that had been taking place in the USA starting in 1969 with the American Indian Movement. There is one episode toward the end of the film about some kind of Indian awareness: an activist is coming to speak to the people of the reservation one day and he calls for some action from Indians. He is accompanied by two white police officers in civilian suits, though we do not know what they are precisely. He asks them to stand and he mocks them as some kind of infringement on his freedom of movement and speech. Two of the boys take his suggestion in their own hands and go out and destroy one beautiful car they consider must be the car of the two police officers. Unluckily it is the car of the speaker and the two cops have a simple, even drab car and they gallantly drive the speaker to his hotel, which means outside the reservation. In other words that speaker has a luxury car and he is escorted by two cops more for his comfort and security than to infringe on his freedom of speech.That last note is definitely negative and hopeless. There is no future for Indians from the Indians, by the Indians. And what's more, Silas's sister who has married a white lawyer, can't get a child from him because she says his spermatozoon count is low. She has Gooch, her old boyfriend she did not remained faithful to during his three years in prison, sleep with her in order to get pregnant while the boys are spending the night with her husband they initiate to some kind of Indian name-giving ritual that is in fact some kind of practical joke from them but he plays the game through and in the night he loses his glasses, hence he cannot see very well what is happening: he is being played the Mickey out of him while his wife is getting impregnated by her ex-boyfriend.And they say this is the voice of the future. I mean that future does not seem to be very sunny and bright.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",4,Disturbingly untimely,1379116800,"09 14, 2013",2013,5226,"['Surprising', 'film', 'indeed', 'Canadian', 'quite',

403691,A2Z1TPSSZHN5BB,6304137168,N.,"[44, 44]","I'm a (non-Indian)racial minority who usually likes to see a political message in &quot;ethnic&quot; movies. This isn't really an &quot;ethnic movie,&quot; though. &quot;Dance Me Outside&quot; is an indie comedy-drama about 90's life on an Ontario rez, with a mostly Native cast, but it is lovable by Americans of many different cultural backgrounds. It is also by all accounts one of the best movies I have ever seen. There are an (unfortunately small) handful of subversive movies referencing the colonial experience which shock us/force us out of our &quot;cultural relativism comfort zone.&quot; Such movies {e.g. &quot;Clearcut,&quot; &quot;The Battle of Algiers,&quot;) shock us because they reflect the natural bitterness and residual hate of cultural clash; colonialism, genocide, and outright invasion and land theft are uncomfortable things that make us feel uncomfortable when we're forced to confront them. &quot;Dance Me Outside&quot; as an &quot;ethnic&quot; narrative works in entirely the opposite fashion, but it works brilliantly. This movie is the bomb, people.Director Bruce McDonald, a non-Indian, has co-written a fabulous snappy script (based on Kinsella's story)that is almost literally back-to-back one-liners:immensely quotable. Every type of humor--from broad physical to ironic wry humor--is at work here. McDonald's approach to directing is obviously well thought-out, yet we never sense him at work when we are watching; all we see are the loose, engaging, charming results--this movie unfolds almost effortlessly, seamlessly. I dare anyone to say they feel uncomfortable while watching this movie, even during its so-called &quot;darker&quot; moments. Euro-Americans will be comforted to know that &quot;Dance Me Outside&quot; is not an in-your-face political Indian movie, of the afore mentioned type. Conversely, even I, exasperated with the sympathetic portrayal of Whites in most movies about minorities, can not help but be charmed by Kevin Hicks' bumbling, well-meaning &quot;white husband&quot; character. This brings us to the other shining strength of the movie: the awesome, awesome ensemble cast. Ryan Black is too witty, good-humored, and genuine to be a superstar. He simply has too much personality to be a Hollywood star. His natural elegance and affability really anchor this movie; holding it all together, he's like a rock--WHAT a breakout performance. The more widely-known Adam Beach has done his best work here. He is completely charming, disarming, and engaging--a reflection of the spirit of the whole movie. I heard he almost didn't get cast in this role; say a prayer of thanks that he did, because the naturalism of his performance--while, by nature of the character, not as subtle or as elegant as Black's-- is astonishing. The Podemski sisters are delightful, especially Jennifer as the feisty, down-to-earth girlfriend. Her younger sister has a smaller role, to which she brings every bit as much spirit, sass, and conviction. In fact, no role in &quot;Dance&quot; is too small for its actor to give it the attention it deserves. The wryness of the all-knowing mother, the sophistication and intelligence of Lisa LaCroix as Illianna, and, of course, the presence of Michael Greyeyes, who injects into his tough-guy role as ex-con Gooch the most poignant and believable undercurrent of vulnerability: the beauty of this movie is in its detail. Sandrine Holt (&quot;Black Robe&quot;), here as Poppy, in a forgettable performance, perhaps unfairly gets star billing, but this is a minor flaw indeed. Each and every character reaches out to you. Even the racist skinheads are likeable!Most people should be able to watch this movie three or four times consecutively, easy. It's that light, refreshing, and well-crafted. It's that good. All elements of &quot;Dance Me Outside&quot;--screenplay, cast, editing, and the kickin' mixed Indian and mainstream soundtrack--converge as though by divine design to form a near-perfect piece of film narrative. I don't want to compare it to that OTHER recent movie about rez youth because they're two different movies with different goals in mind, but, as good as &quot;Smoke Signals&quot; is, &quot;Dance Me Outside&quot; kills it. I don't know how--both have superb casts and musical scores--but &quot;Dance Me Outside&quot; is better. I think it's the effortlessness of it. &quot;Dance Me Outside&quot; is good enough to be used in film schools as an instruction manual on independent films. Don't even bother to rent it. You may as well buy it, if you're going to buy a movie this year, or ever again. It will make you feel so at ease you may then choose to go out and see a subversive hard-hitting political movie to counteract the sheer buoyancy and joy of &quot;Dance me Outside&quot;--although I think finding a movie that could eclipse this much charm would be pretty hard.",5,Effortless,999302400,"09 1, 2001",2001,4876,"[""'m"", 'non-Indian', 'racial', 'minority', 'who', 'usually', 'see',

403693,A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB,6304137168,"Sarah ""Eat Dessert First""","[30, 31]","""Dance Me Outside"" was a fantastic Canadian film from 1994 based on the novel of the same name by W.P. Kinsella. Directed by Bruce McDonald and co-written by Don McKellar (""Last Night,"" ""The Red Violin""), the film centers around Frank Fencepost and Silas Crow, two young adults on a reserve in northern Ontario, planning on going to college in Toronto to become mechanics. We are introduced early on to their family and (girl)friends, and the tragic act that sets the tone occurs early on in the film. ""Dance Me Outside"" inspired the (Canadian) TV series ""The Rez"" (1996) which featured many of the same actors and characters (Frank, Silas, Sadie, Joseph, Etta).The film opens with a shot of Silas Crow crouched down staring at his namesake, accompanied by a native flute and a voiceover. Throughout the film there are ties between the spiritual and the natural, whether it is Illiana's mother telling her that babies come from the Great Spirit or the predictions of Mad Etta. The scenes of Robert McVey, Illiana's white Torontonian yuppie lawyer husband, being ""initiated"" into the tribe as a ruse for Gooch (Illiana's old flame who was just released from jail) to impregnate Illiana, border on the absurd, representing white stereotypes of First Nations and vice versa, but there is a power, a lack of inhibition and an attempt to become one with nature, that makes it moving.""Dance Me Outside"" features many talented First Nations actors: Adam Beach (who was also in the award-winning ""Smoke Signals""), Ryan Rajendra Black, Jennifer Podemski, Michael Greyeyes, Selim Running Bear Sandoval, and Vince Manitowabi among them.The music was equally excellent, from a variety of bands such as Kashtin, the Vern Cheechoo Band, Joanne Shenandoah, the Headstones, Keith Secola, and R. Carlos Nakai.In some ways I preferred this film to the much-hyped ""Smoke Signals"" based on the strength of the screenplay, the cinematography, and the realistic depiction and treatment of current First Nations social issues. There is some violence, vandalism, nudity, and swearing, but this is a touching, powerful film about community, strength, love and tradition.",5,A gripping tale of love and loss on an Ontario reserve....,1016496000,"03 19, 2002",2002,2145,"['Dance', 'Me', 'Outside', 'was', 'fantastic', 'Canadian', 'film', '1994', 'based', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'W.P', 'Kinsella', 'Directed', 'Bruce', 'McDonald', 'co-written', 'Don', 'McKellar', 'Last', 'Night', 'Red', 'Violin', 'film', 'centers', 'Frank', 'Fencepost', 'Silas', 'Crow', 'two', 'young', 'adults', 'reserve', 'northern', 'Ontario', 'planning', 'going', 'college', 'Toronto', 'become', 'mechanics', 'are', 'introduced', 'early', 'family', 'girl', 'tragic', 'act', 'tone', 'early', 'film', 'Dance', 'Me', 'Outside', 'inspired', 'Canadian', 'TV', 'series', 'Rez', '1996', 'featured', 'many', 'same', 'actors', 'characters', 'Frank', 'Silas', 'Sadie', 'Joseph', 'Etta', '.The', 'film', 'shot', 'Silas', 'Crow', 'crouched', 'down', 'staring', 'namesake', 'accompanied', 'native', 'flute', 'voiceover', 'film', 'are', 'ties', 'spiritual', 'natural', 'Illiana', 'mother', 'telling', 'come', 'Great', 'Spirit', 'predictions', 'Mad', 'Etta', 'scenes', 'Robert', 'McVey', 'Illiana', 'white', 'Torontonian', 'yuppie', 'lawyer', 'husband', 'being', 'initiated', 'tribe', 'ruse', 'Gooch', 'Illiana', 'old', 'flame', 'who', 'was', 'just', 'released', 'jail', 'impregnate', 'Illiana', 'border', 'absurd', 'representing', 'white', 'stereotypes', 'First', 'Nations', 'vice', 'versa', 'power', 'lack', 'inhibition', 'attempt', 'become', 'one', 'nature', 'moving', 'Dance', 'Me', 'Outside', 'many', 'talented', 'First', 'Nations', 'actors', 'Adam', 'Beach', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'award-winning', 'Smoke', 'Signals', 'Ryan', 'Rajendra', 'Black', 'Jennifer', 'Podemski', 'Michael', 'Greyeyes', 'Selim', 'Running', 'Bear', 'Sandoval', 'Vince', 'Manitowabi', 'them.The', 'music', 'was', 'equally', 'excellent', 'variety', 'bands', 'such', 'Kashtin', 'Vern', 'Cheechoo', 'Band', 'Joanne', 'Shenandoah', 'Headstones', 'Keith', 'Secola', 'R.', 'Carlos', 'Nakai.In', 'ways', 'preferred', 'film', 'much-hyped', 'Smoke', 'Signals', 'based', 'strength', 'screenplay', 'cinematography', 'realistic', 'depiction', 'treatment', 'current', 'First', 'Nations', 'social', 'issues', 'violence', 'vandalism', 'nudity', 'swearing', 'touching', 'powerful', 'film', 'community', 'strength', 'love', 'tradition']",Dance Me Outside VHS
