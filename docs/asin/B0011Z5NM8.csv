1133433,A59NEDTG1DHG7,B0011Z5NM8,Addicted2Amazon!,"[3, 3]","The Firm has created another classic!!  ""Cardio Overdrive"" is a 45-minute fitness program that combines cardio and intervals of fast-paced, light sculpting.  This DVD is very similar in format and purpose to an earlier Firm title called ""Ultimate Fat Burning Workout,"" in that it uses light weights only and flows through more like fast and slow cardio than cardio and toning.I LOVE this program!  It is fun, effective and challenging (but without being so difficult that it inspires dread or requires you to eat like Michael Phelps to produce enough energy to get through it!).  If you are a beginner exerciser, it definitely will challenge you and the sweat will pour!  However, if you are an intermediate to advanced, it is a great maintenance workout that will burn calories and help keep you toned in the right places.""Cardio Overdrive,"" led by instructor Alison Davis, begins with a 5-minute-or-so warm-up.  After a quick back stretch, you pretty much hit the ground running and your feet never really stop.  The warm-up consists of V-steps forward and back, knee raises, glute raises, lunges and quick calf stretches.  Then you're on to the first cardio segment.All of the cardio in ""CO"" is medium impact. (There is some hopping, but not a whole lot, and what hopping there is can easily be substituted with low-impact squats or other variations.  All variations are demonstrated by Sue Mi, the beginner modifier.)  The cardio is also fun and varied. The moves are of the classic cardio vein, with side-to-side steps/sprints, jacks, high-and-low jogging, repeater knees, and some plyo jumping (the jogging and plyo jumping only occur in one section).  There is NO dance and NO kickboxing (with the exception of a front-and-back kick, no arms, that occurs in one cardio section).There are 2 toning sections.  In both, Alison suggests that you use light weights (I'm guessing theirs are 3 to 5 lbs., but you can always go a little heavier if you try that weight and it is too easy).  The toning is okay.  It consists of a lot of The Firm's signature compound moves such as moving squats with bicep curls, lunges with L-shaped arms, side lunges with sweeping both arms, knee raises with tricep dips, etc.  The moves are all done quickly, so although your heart rate will come down a little, you still will continue to burn calories AND tone up your muscles somewhat.Though this program tones, it does so VERY lightly, and it is more of a medium-intensity cardio workout than anything else.  I am a high intermediate, and does this workout max me out?  No. But it is too fun to condemn just b/c it's not crazy hard!  To make it more challenging, you have several options:1. Add more weight during the toning sections.2. Add higher impact to the cardio. Hop whereever you can, and do NONE of the lower impact options, not even in the beginning.3. Add onto ""Cardio Overdrive"" with a short, 20-minute toning workout. To supplement this, I actually add on The Firm's ""Power Sculpt Workout,"" using the green 9-lb. Sculpting Stick.  This program is a mere 20 minutes from beginning to end, and is Perfection for rounding out ""CO"" and making a solid, more difficult hour of exercise.""Cardio Overdrive"" is another fave.  Great workout, great format, great music, great instructor.

1133436,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B0011Z5NM8,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[2, 2]","I recently purchased The Firm Ultimate Fat-Burning Collection, and this workout was one of the four selections included on that DVD.  Although Allison Davis is not my favorite Firm instructor (more on this below), overall, I found this to be an enjoyable workout that kept my heart rate up.  Allison works out in the newer Firm studio (wood floors, fake windows) with four background exercisers.The 5-minute warm-up didn't drag like some of the Firm warm-ups tend to do, and it flowed right into the first cardio combination.  (Note: each segment of this workout lasts approximately 5 minutes, and although there are no chapter menus, there are internal chapter breaks so that you could uses the skip button of your remote to move forward & back if desired.)  The initial cardio segment includes step taps, knee ups with a leg sweep, and a ""quad star"" (rather than the usual tri star) with pony arms.  This is followed by the first AWT (aerobic weight training) segment, with Allison and crew using light weights.  The first move is what Allison calls the ""back & bun burner,"" a side squat with row.  Other exercises in this segment include a clean & press with a front kick, a squat with biceps curl, and a front lunge with a side/rear delt raise.  The transitions felt a bit rushed here, but the HR does stay up.After this, it's back to cardio.  The first move involves a side step forward and back with hip shake or optional skater jumps.  This is followed by a front/back/front kick, a glute/knee/glute raise, and finally, a samba with bow & arrow arms.  The next cardio section was my least favorite.  It was mostly high impact (although Sue Mi showed low-impact options), with power jogs, high knees, and plyos, but I just didn't find the choreography to be very much fun.Next comes another AWT segment.  This one begins with a dip and scoop combination and then a side/front lunge ""corkscrew"" move.  Moving on, Allison adds knees up with a triceps press and crunch plus a side step with upright row.  After this, there are just two more cardio sections to finish.  The first begins with a back V-step and moves into jacks and knee repeaters.  The second starts with a back-side-front step and then adds in a leg swing, a glute extension, hamstring curls, and twists and swings to finish.  The 6-minute cool-down consists of flowing moves and dynamic stretches, bringing the total workout time right in at 46 minutes.This is a decent workout that I would rate as low intermediate.  My heart rate stayed within my working zone the entire time, yet I never felt worn out or like I was gasping for breath.  I found most of the choreography to be fun, but sometimes the Firm's arm movements feel a bit ""fussy"" to me, and some of the moves in this workout felt overly rushed.  Still, I thought this was a solid cardio workout, and I would recommend this DVD.",4,Decent cardio workout for advanced beginners to low intermediate,1286841600,"10 12, 2010",2010,2859,"['recently', 'purchased', 'Firm', 'Ultimate', 'Fat-Burning', 'Collection', 'workout', 'was', 'one', 'four', 'selections', 'included', 'DVD', 'Allison', 'Davis', 'not', 'favorite', 'Firm', 'instructor', 'more', 'below', 'overall', 'found', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'workout', 'kept', 'heart', 'rate', 'up', 'Allison', 'out', 'newer', 'Firm', 'studio', 'wood', 'floors', 'fake', 'windows', 'four', 'background', 'exercisers.The', '5-minute', 'warm-up', 'did', ""n't"", 'drag', 'Firm', 'warm-ups', 'tend', 'do', 'flowed', 'right', 'first', 'cardio', 'combination', 'Note', 'segment', 'workout', 'approximately', '5', 'minutes', 'are', 'chapter', 'menus', 'are', 'internal', 'chapter', 'breaks', 'could', 'uses', 'skip', 'button', 'remote', 'move', 'forward', 'back', 'desired', 'initial', 'cardio', 'segment', 'step', 'taps', 'knee', 'ups', 'leg', 'sweep', 'quad', 'star', 'rather', 'usual', 'tri', 'star', 'pony', 'arms', 'followed', 'first', 'AWT', 'aerobic', 'weight', 'training', 'segment', 'Allison', 'crew', 'using', 'light', 'weights', 'first', 'move', 'what', 'Allison', 'back', 'bun', 'burner', 'side', 'squat', 'row', 'Other', 'exercises', 'segment', 'include', 'clean', 'press', 'front', 'kick', 'squat', 'biceps', 'curl', 'front', 'lunge', 'side/rear', 'delt', 'raise', 'transitions', 'felt', 'bit', 'rushed', 'here', 'HR', 'stay', 'up.After', 'back', 'cardio', 'first', 'move', 'side', 'step', 'forward', 'back', 'hip', 'shake', 'optional', 'skater', 'jumps', 'followed', 'front/back/front', 'kick', 'glute/knee/glute', 'raise', 'finally', 'samba', 'bow', 'arrow', 'arms', 'next', 'cardio', 'section', 'was', 'least', 'favorite', 'was', 'mostly', 'high', 'impact', 'Sue', 'Mi', 'showed', 'low-impact', 'options', 'power', 'jogs', 'high', 'knees', 'plyos', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'choreography', 'be', 'very', 'much', 'fun.Next', 'AWT', 'segment', 'one', 'dip', 'scoop', 'combination', 'then', 'side/front', 'lunge', 'corkscrew', 'move', 'Moving', 'Allison', 'up', 'triceps', 'press', 'crunch', 'side', 'step', 'upright', 'row', 'are', 'just', 'two', 'more', 'cardio', 'sections', 'finish', 'first', 'back', 'V-step', 'moves', 'jacks', 'knee', 'repeaters', 'second', 'starts', 'back-side-front', 'step', 'then', 'leg', 'swing', 'glute', 'extension', 'hamstring', 'curls', 'twists', 'swings', 'finish', '6-minute', 'cool-down', 'consists', 'flowing', 'moves', 'dynamic', 'stretches', 'bringing', 'total', 'workout', 'time', 'right', '46', 'minutes.This', 'decent', 'workout', 'would', 'rate', 'low', 'intermediate', 'heart', 'rate', 'stayed', 'working', 'zone', 'entire', 'time', 'yet', 'never', 'felt', 'worn', 'out', 'was', 'gasping', 'breath', 'found', 'most', 'choreography', 'be', 'fun', 'sometimes', 'Firm', 'arm', 'movements', 'feel', 'bit', 'fussy', 'moves', 'workout', 'felt', 'overly', 'rushed', 'Still', 'thought', 'was', 'solid', 'cardio', 'workout', 'would', 'recommend', 'DVD']",The FIRM: Cardio Overdrive

I wished I liked Allison Davis, but I don't find her to be as enjoyable as the other instuctors and I find her to be weak as an instructor. This workout is too fast for the moves that they are using, it is awkward, some of the choreography doesn't make sense and the queing is very poor. I also didn't find the moves to be effective either as a cario workout or a toning workout. There are parts of the workout where all I could think about was the question ""can you pat your head and rub your belly at the same time?"" the moves are not designed for easy cooridnation, your arms and legs often seem to be moving in counterintuitive directions, additionally some of the sets don't end evenly so you have to do a catch up half rep which is confusing. I understand that sometimes you need to get used to a routine, that's not the problem here, it's truly that the moves are awkward and it's really hard to be that coordinated. Think about how much you have to concentrate to pat your head and rub your belly, now try and do that while bouncing, sweating and switching from left to right. As I said the queing is bad, Allison hardly ever tells you left or right, most of the time she just says ""other leg"" if she ques you at all, and she isn't good about telling youu to get ready for the next move. It's frustrating, good queing can really make or break a workout. All that said EVEN if I could manage to get althe choreography down I still think it would hard to keep form due to pace and positioning and I don't think the workout would feel at all challenging cardio or toning/strenght training wise.

This was a tough video for me, and not in a good way.  I probably won't be putting it into my DVD player again any time soon.

Not only did I feel the cardio moves were very difficult to follow, these ""sculpting moves"" seem a bit like false advertising to me.  I seriously doubt that these will do much sculpting for you.  You quickly go between some different (and kind of silly) moves with weights, but it's part of a fast routine.  You don't have time to switch to a different weight that would be appropriate for each excercise (e.g. row to a lateral raise) so you are either not able to complete half the moves (if your weight is too heavy) or you aren't getting a workout during several moves because the weight is too light.  I'm sure you will burn lots of calories once you are actually able to follow the whole dvd/routine, but since this would take most people several attempts to figure out, why waste your exercise time?

This one is a bit different. Why? I think the cardio is more intense than on some of the other workouts. It's the focus of the workout this time, rather than the side dish. I like that, because sometimes, after lifting weights the day before, I really need something that's mostly cardio. It isn't a beginner workout, in my opinion, but I think intermediates to advanced exercisers will get a good workout from this one. It definitely gets the heart rate up, and quickly!I've read several reviews here, stating that this workout is too ""dancey"" and/or ""too difficult to learn"". Well, I disagree. That's what the rewind, pause, and slow motion buttons are for. To me, it was no more difficult to learn than any other workout, and it's definitely not as difficult as some of the other instructors' workouts that I've tried in the past. If people think this one is tough to master, then I hope they never try a Cathe workout. Compared to her, this one is a piece of cake! Maybe the first time through would be a challenge to master the moves, but the second and third times through, I think it would get easier.The best thing about this workout is it's FUN!

The original 6 volumes are still my favorite but lately, even though I've been rotating between the 6 Strong Body, I have hit a plateau.  I'm really not a fan of the newer Firms, the moves are boring: they start with one set of moves, then add another and another so that after 8 minutes you've done the origina moves of the set like 12 times. Repitious. The originals were challenging and never boring. Anyway, I needed to add a different routine to my current one so I tried this dvd.The instructor isn't as motivating and the set is bland unlike the original grant ""museum"" set. BUT LET ME TELL YOU: I felt lighter in the tummy and hip area after using it once! Is it repitious? Yes. Kinda boring?

1133460,A3MFB2Z14O2ORN,B0011Z5NM8,"Space Monkey ""exercise junkie""","[3, 3]","I picked up a copy of Alison Davis'The Firm: Ultimate Fat Burning Workout2 years ago.  This was the first time I ever tried a workout by The Firm, and I have to say I stopped it after the first 20 minutes, frustrated and unhappy because I couldn't pick up the moves.  I swore off all of The Firm workouts after that, thinking they were little more than 40-50 minutes of agony and frustration.  However, I decided to give them another try, and picked up a copy ofThe Firm: Pump, Jump 'N Jab, and loved every minute of it.  Since then, I have become a fan of The Firm, but not necessarily of Alison Davis.  I saw this one in the store, and decided to give it a try, because I wanted a good cardio workout to balance out my DVD workout collection.  I have done this workout twice; the first time I didn't like it much.  However, I have had more experience with The Firm workouts since then, and the second time was much better.  While I can't say I love it, I can say it is a solid cardio workout.  Here's the breakdown:THE GOOD:1) It is a nice cardio workout, with a mix of low- and high-impact moves.  I like how the intensity gets ramped up until it is highest in the middle, and then the intensity gets slowed down again.  My heart rate was up pretty much the entire time, especially during the highest-intensity segment that involved running in place and high knees.2) The segments with the light weights (I used 3 pounds) were easy to follow, and kept my heart rate up because of the use of their ""4-limb"" movements (also known as compound movements).  The pace was brisk during these segments, but I felt safe doing weight-lifting movements with light weights at that pace.3) I thought the warm-up was very nice, almost a small cardio workout unto itself.4) A lot of variety to the moves, as usual . . because you really have to pay attention, the time flies by in this workout, and it's over before you know it.NEEDS IMPROVEMENT:1) A lot of reviewers say that Alison's cueing is good. . I'm not sure about that.  She does let you know what's coming, but I would have appreciated it if, when we were starting a series of moves ""from the top,"" if she would have reminded me what foot we're starting on.  I'm not that coordinated, and my brain needs a reminder of ""left side!""  or ""right side!""  Rebekah Sturkie & Kelsie Daniels, in their workouts for The Firm, are much better at that, in my opinion.2) The moves in the very last cardio segment, to me, were too confusing.  Again, if you have some dance experience or have more coordination than myself, you won't have a problem.  However, I had some major issues with keeping up with her during that segment simply because the moves were a little ""fussy.""  I had to just focus on getting the footwork down, and forgo any arm movements that screwed up my footwork.3) I do wish this workout would have been at least 50 minutes of cardio, with a 5-minute cool-down afterwards.  I just felt it was too short, and wish there had been more than one high-intensity segment in the middle.  While my heart rate was kept elevated, I wish it could have stayed elevated during the middle segment for longer for maximum cardio benefit.Like I said, this is a solid cardio workout, with some very light weight training segments that still keep your heart rate up.  While I wish it would have been longer and some of the moves less complicated, I have to say I liked it, overall, and will be doing it again.  It's a nice workout to do if you are alternating your strength and cardio days.  Just don't write it off the first time (like I almost did) just because you can't get the moves. . .it will take you a few times through to get them all down.  It's worth the time and effort.",4,I begrudgingly have begun to like this workout.,1262390400,"01 2, 2010",2010,3719,"['picked', 'up', 'copy', 'Alison', ""Davis'The"", 'Firm', 'Ultimate', 'Fat', 'Burning', 'Workout2', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'ever', 'tried', 'workout', 'Firm', 'have', 'say', 'stopped', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'frustrated', 'unhappy', 'could', ""n't"", 'pick', 'up', 'moves', 'swore', 'off', 'Firm', 'thinking', 'were', 'little', 'more', '40-50', 'minutes', 'agony', 'frustration', 'However', 'decided', 'give', 'try', 'picked', 'up', 'copy', 'ofThe', 'Firm', 'Pump', 'Jump', 'N', 'Jab', 'loved', 'minute', 'then', 'have', 'become', 'fan', 'Firm', 'not', 'necessarily', 'Alison', 'Davis', 'saw', 'one', 'store', 'decided', 'give', 'try', 'wanted', 'good', 'cardio', 'workout', 'balance', 'out', 'DVD', 'workout', 'collection', 'have', 'done', 'workout', 'twice', 'first', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'much', 'However', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'experience', 'Firm', 'then', 'second', 'time', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'love', 'can', 'say', 'solid', 'cardio', 'workout', 'Here', 'breakdown', 'GOOD:1', 'nice', 'cardio', 'workout', 'mix', 'low-', 'high-impact', 'moves', 'how', 'intensity', 'ramped', 'up', 'highest', 'middle', 'then', 'intensity', 'slowed', 'down', 'again', 'heart', 'rate', 'was', 'up', 'pretty', 'much', 'entire', 'time', 'especially', 'highest-intensity', 'segment', 'involved', 'running', 'place', 'high', 'knees.2', 'segments', 'light', 'weights', 'used', '3', 'pounds', 'were', 'easy', 'follow', 'kept', 'heart', 'rate', 'use', '4-limb', 'movements', 'also', 'known', 'compound', 'movements', 'pace', 'was', 'brisk', 'segments', 'felt', 'safe', 'doing', 'weight-lifting', 'movements', 'light', 'weights', 'pace.3', 'thought', 'warm-up', 'was', 'very', 'nice', 'almost', 'small', 'cardio', 'workout', 'itself.4', 'lot', 'variety', 'moves', 'usual', 'really', 'have', 'pay', 'attention', 'time', 'flies', 'workout', 'over', 'know', 'it.NEEDS', 'IMPROVEMENT:1', 'A', 'lot', 'reviewers', 'say', 'Alison', 'cueing', 'good', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'let', 'know', 'what', 'coming', 'would', 'have', 'appreciated', 'when', 'were', 'starting', 'series', 'moves', 'top', 'would', 'have', 'reminded', 'what', 'foot', ""'re"", 'starting', ""'m"", 'not', 'coordinated', 'brain', 'reminder', 'left', 'side', 'right', 'side', 'Rebekah', 'Sturkie', 'Kelsie', 'Daniels', 'workouts', 'Firm', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'opinion.2', 'moves', 'very', 'last', 'cardio', 'segment', 'were', 'too', 'confusing', 'Again', 'have', 'dance', 'experience', 'have', 'more', 'coordination', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'However', 'had', 'major', 'issues', 'keeping', 'up', 'segment', 'simply', 'moves', 'were', 'little', 'fussy', 'had', 'just', 'focus', 'getting', 'footwork', 'down', 'forgo', 'arm', 'movements', 'screwed', 'up', 'footwork.3', 'do', 'wish', 'workout', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'least', '50', 'minutes', 'cardio', '5-minute', 'cool-down', 'afterwards', 'just', 'felt', 'was', 'too', 'short', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'one', 'high-intensity', 'segment', 'middle', 'heart', 'rate', 'was', 'kept', 'elevated', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'stayed', 'elevated', 'middle', 'segment', 'longer', 'maximum', 'cardio', 'benefit.Like', 'said', 'solid', 'cardio', 'workout', 'very', 'light', 'weight', 'training', 'segments', 'still', 'keep', 'heart', 'rate', 'up', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'longer', 'moves', 'less', 'complicated', 'have', 'say', 'liked', 'overall', 'will', 'be', 'doing', 'again', 'nice', 'workout', 'do', 'are', 'alternating', 'strength', 'cardio', 'days', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'write', 'off', 'first', 'time', 'almost', 'did', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'moves', '.it', 'will', 'take', 'few', 'times', 'get', 'down', 'time', 'effort']",The FIRM: Cardio Overdrive

1133462,A1T6VABQU7RBMA,B0011Z5NM8,T. Carr,"[3, 3]","I am less than enthusiastic about the Firm workouts in general but a fan of this particular workout with Alison Davis. I saw that some comments found the movements too difficult to follow... I thought Alison's cuing was fantastic and had no trouble following along. The moves in and of themselves are not overly complicated to pick up so I'm not sure why there were so many complaints. It does take a certain amount of coordination but I was never left confused or stumbling over my feet. If anyone has tried Alison's Cardio Dance Fusion dvd I found this to be less dance-ish and easier to pickup. In my opinion, her cuing is clear and consistent, making it easy to follow.The workout starts with a warmup that's heavily cardio driven. It's an aerobic routine in and of itself. It then continues to alternate between cardio segments and some segments with weights that still incorporate full body movement throughout so nothing is static. I believe there were 2 weight segments and maybe 4 different cardio routine segments. At the end there is a cool down. I found the intensity level to be moderate (leaning toward the easy side... but I consider high intensity to be the workouts I CAN'T get through, moderate intensity to be the ones I CAN get through but feel like I need to stop and rest, and low intensity to be ones I get through without feeling like I need to stop. This one was manageable to finish without getting discouraged but still worthwhile.) I have bad knees and often have issues with cardio focused workouts that are high impact. I did not experience any discomfort during or after the workout and I did the advanced modifications throughout.For what it is (a cardio workout) I think it is pretty effective. I kind of wish there was an ab section and some more exercises to make it a more well rounded, balanced workout, but it is more cardio focused and it delivers in this area. It does indirectly target certain muscles inherent to the movements, but even the weight sections that are meant to focus on the upper body I found somewhat simple with 3 lb. weights, which is what I typically use with aerobic workouts of this nature, and in the future I will probably increase the weight to 5 lbs. for more of a challenge. However, to me the most important thing in a workout is that it provides an achievable challenge but is fun and enjoyable throughout. Cardio Overdrive achieves this in my opinion.",4,Solid cardio workout with some strength training,1301443200,"03 30, 2011",2011,2421,"['am', 'less', 'enthusiastic', 'Firm', 'general', 'fan', 'particular', 'workout', 'Alison', 'Davis', 'saw', 'comments', 'found', 'movements', 'too', 'difficult', 'follow', 'thought', 'Alison', 'cuing', 'was', 'fantastic', 'had', 'trouble', 'following', 'along', 'moves', 'are', 'not', 'overly', 'complicated', 'pick', 'up', 'so', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'complaints', 'take', 'certain', 'amount', 'coordination', 'was', 'never', 'left', 'confused', 'stumbling', 'feet', 'anyone', 'tried', 'Alison', 'Cardio', 'Dance', 'Fusion', 'dvd', 'found', 'be', 'less', 'dance-ish', 'easier', 'pickup', 'opinion', 'cuing', 'clear', 'consistent', 'making', 'easy', 'follow.The', 'workout', 'warmup', 'heavily', 'cardio', 'driven', 'aerobic', 'routine', 'then', 'alternate', 'cardio', 'segments', 'segments', 'weights', 'still', 'incorporate', 'full', 'body', 'movement', 'nothing', 'static', 'believe', 'were', '2', 'weight', 'segments', 'maybe', '4', 'different', 'cardio', 'routine', 'segments', 'end', 'cool', 'down', 'found', 'intensity', 'level', 'be', 'moderate', 'leaning', 'easy', 'side', 'consider', 'high', 'intensity', 'be', 'workouts', 'CA', ""N'T"", 'get', 'moderate', 'intensity', 'be', 'ones', 'CAN', 'get', 'feel', 'need', 'stop', 'rest', 'low', 'intensity', 'be', 'ones', 'get', 'feeling', 'need', 'stop', 'one', 'was', 'manageable', 'finish', 'getting', 'discouraged', 'still', 'worthwhile', 'have', 'bad', 'knees', 'often', 'have', 'issues', 'cardio', 'focused', 'workouts', 'are', 'high', 'impact', 'did', 'not', 'experience', 'discomfort', 'workout', 'did', 'advanced', 'modifications', 'throughout.For', 'what', 'cardio', 'workout', 'think', 'pretty', 'effective', 'kind', 'wish', 'was', 'ab', 'section', 'more', 'exercises', 'make', 'more', 'well', 'rounded', 'balanced', 'workout', 'more', 'cardio', 'focused', 'area', 'indirectly', 'target', 'certain', 'muscles', 'inherent', 'movements', 'even', 'weight', 'sections', 'are', 'meant', 'focus', 'upper', 'body', 'found', 'somewhat', 'simple', '3', 'lb', 'weights', 'what', 'typically', 'use', 'aerobic', 'workouts', 'nature', 'future', 'will', 'probably', 'increase', 'weight', '5', 'lbs', 'more', 'challenge', 'However', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'workout', 'achievable', 'challenge', 'fun', 'enjoyable', 'Cardio', 'Overdrive', 'opinion']",The FIRM: Cardio Overdrive
