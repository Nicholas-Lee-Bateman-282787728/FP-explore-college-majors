My toddler watched 2 of the 3 dvds yesterday and finished watching the other one today. I don't understand why others have said that Steve isn't on the dvds. Each one of the dvd's do have bonus episodes, most of the bonus episodes are of Steve and not Joe. I do think there are special features on each dvd. I know one dvd does have an interactive play feature. My toddler was playing it earlier.Of course my toddler loves Joe and Steve both, so it was a win win situation for us.

845692,AH0NIZMS1RKUI,B0002V7OHY,Elizabeth,"[0, 0]",I was disappointed that it was Joe and not Steve. They have bonus features showing the episodes with Steve but overall it will be Joe. I have a 16 year old and we all grew up with Steve and I purchased this dvd combo in hopes of passing along the Blue's Clues tradition to my 2 year old. I am under the impression there was some deliberate false advertising because when I ordered it the first name they had starring was Steve Burns followed by everyone else.Overall the teaching fundamentals are great but to be honest Joe just doesn't cut it.,3,Misleading Product,1350172800,"10 14, 2012",2012,544,"['was', 'disappointed', 'was', 'Joe', 'not', 'Steve', 'have', 'bonus', 'features', 'showing', 'episodes', 'Steve', 'overall', 'will', 'be', 'Joe', 'have', '16', 'year', 'old', 'grew', 'up', 'Steve', 'purchased', 'dvd', 'combo', 'hopes', 'passing', 'Blue', 'Clues', 'tradition', '2', 'year', 'old', 'am', 'impression', 'was', 'deliberate', 'false', 'advertising', 'when', 'ordered', 'first', 'name', 'had', 'starring', 'was', 'Steve', 'Burns', 'followed', 'everyone', 'teaching', 'fundamentals', 'are', 'great', 'be', 'honest', 'Joe', 'just', ""n't"", 'cut']",Blue's Clues - ABC's 123's and More Collection

If you've been keeping up on your ""Blue's Clues"" DVD releases, then there is nothing here you haven't already seen. ABC's 123's and More Collection is nothing more than a repackaging of three previous DVDs: Blue Takes You to School, Shapes and Colors, and Blue's Big Band. If you don't have those, or haven't seen them before, this box-set might be worth checking out, since you get a lower price than you would purchasing all three separately.

Because several persons recommended it so I gave Blues Clues a try. And this product came with a range of topics like going to school, letter and numbers.Product comes with three dvds and each dvd has two episodes plus two bonus episodes so four per dvd. I find the show a bit tacky and boring but my two daughters (aged 1 and 2) seem to really take to it. At the time of this review, I cannot say it's helping them count or speak better but when it's on, they follow it and can't stop watching; I cannot turn off an episode in the middle even if they saw it before ... it must play to the end.Considering they never saw Blue's Clues before, I'd say it was a hit.",3,From someone who's not a fan,1368576000,"05 15, 2013",2013,742,"['am', 'not', 'fan', 'familiar', 'Blue', 'when', 'bought', 'DVD', 'so', 'why', 'did', 'i', 'several', 'persons', 'recommended', 'gave', 'Blues', 'Clues', 'try', 'product', 'came', 'range', 'topics', 'going', 'school', 'letter', 'numbers.Product', 'three', 'dvds', 'dvd', 'two', 'episodes', 'two', 'bonus', 'episodes', 'so', 'four', 'dvd', 'find', 'show', 'bit', 'tacky', 'boring', 'two', 'daughters', 'aged', '1', '2', 'seem', 'really', 'take', 'time', 'review', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'helping', 'count', 'speak', 'better', 'when', 'follow', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'watching', 'can', 'not', 'turn', 'off', 'episode', 'middle', 'even', 'saw', 'must', 'play', 'end.Considering', 'never', 'saw', 'Blue', 'Clues', ""'d"", 'say', 'was', 'hit']",Blue's Clues - ABC's 123's and More Collection

He was so excited so I let him. Reuben LOVES both Joe or Steve in Blue Clues. What's awesome about this collection is the educational value and entertainment for my son. I believe if a child watches educational videos, it's healthier for their development then watching TV with commercials.
