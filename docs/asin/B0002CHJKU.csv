830268,A1ELVOQTTWNLJ1,B0002CHJKU,Cameron Johnson,"[1, 1]","So Margaret Cho is kind of my hero, now. She's funny, smart, crass, astute and powerful. Taking her jokes from her experiences as a woman, a Korean-American, an actor and just an awesome person in general, her stand-up is what all great stand-up should strive to be - it's both powerfully funny and genuine.This particular set is great because it's three collections between 2000 and 2004. There's this wonderful evolution in both her comedic timing and the stories she tells. It's wonderful to see how different she is comparing her stand-up from ""I'm the One That I Want"" in 2000, and ""Revolution"" in 2004. This is stand-up comedy at it's finest.",5,Best Comedian I've Seen,1304640000,"05 6, 2011",2011,648,"['So', 'Margaret', 'Cho', 'kind', 'hero', 'now', 'funny', 'smart', 'crass', 'astute', 'powerful', 'Taking', 'jokes', 'experiences', 'woman', 'Korean-American', 'actor', 'just', 'awesome', 'person', 'general', 'stand-up', 'what', 'great', 'stand-up', 'should', 'strive', 'be', 'powerfully', 'funny', 'genuine.This', 'particular', 'set', 'great', 'three', 'collections', '2000', '2004', 'wonderful', 'evolution', 'comedic', 'timing', 'stories', 'wonderful', 'see', 'how', 'different', 'comparing', 'stand-up', ""'m"", 'One', 'Want', '2000', 'Revolution', '2004', 'stand-up', 'comedy', 'finest']",N/A

I can watch them over and over again. They are not only laugh out loud funny, they are inspirational. I wanted to replace my video copies with DVDs and the boxed set seemed like a great deal. And I guess it is if you think of Revolution as a bonus DVD of out takes. Some gems to be found in there but overall it just pales by comparison.

In her newest show, ASSASSIN (not part of this collection), she is far more political, which for me, is more interesting and frankly, funnier. It's worth, of course, owning all of CHO's work. She is now part of the legendary group of comics that deserve to be heard by all. She has taken the torch from such legengs as Lenny Bruce and George Carlin, and Cho will likely play a role in protecting us from the 'right'.",5,politics aside,1131235200,"11 6, 2005",2005,529,"['love', 'Margaret', 'Cho', 'have', 'admit', 'new', 'positioning', 'better', 'more', 'creative', 'previous', 'newest', 'show', 'ASSASSIN', 'not', 'part', 'collection', 'far', 'more', 'political', 'more', 'interesting', 'frankly', 'funnier', 'worth', 'course', 'owning', 'CHO', 'work', 'now', 'part', 'legendary', 'group', 'comics', 'deserve', 'be', 'heard', 'taken', 'torch', 'such', 'legengs', 'Lenny', 'Bruce', 'George', 'Carlin', 'Cho', 'will', 'likely', 'play', 'role', 'protecting', ""'right""]",N/A

She is hilarious, and one of the best comedians out there right now.  I just got this trilogy pack for my birthday this month, and I immediately tore it open and watched ""I'm the one that I want"" right then and there.  That is her best of the threesome.  The 2nd disc, ""Notorious CHO"" is wickidly funny, but not as so as the the previous disc.  The last one,""Revolution"", which I saw for the first time last night was funny, yet not as much as the former 2.  Actually, I was quite dissapointed by Revolution to be honest. I did laugh more than a  few times, but I could always control myself (ie, no tears, uncotrollable fits of laughter, knee slaps, breathing issues).  She seemed like she just wasn't into it.  Maybe she was sick or something. Her appearance is a little different, I'm thinking plastic surgery on her lips and eyes??  She has noticeably lost weight as well. Her voice was different too, it just didn't seem like the same Margaret that I fell for in the 1st disc.  In summary, I don't know how often I'll watch ""Revolution"", but the other 2 will definitely get plenty of wear.",4,"Hello...my name is Gwen and I'm here to (well, you know!)",1103673600,"12 22, 2004",2004,1169,"['Let', 'just', 'start', 'off', 'saying', 'Margaret', 'Cho', 'ultimate', 'faghag', 'hilarious', 'one', 'best', 'comedians', 'out', 'there', 'right', 'now', 'just', 'got', 'trilogy', 'pack', 'birthday', 'month', 'immediately', 'tore', 'open', 'watched', ""'m"", 'one', 'want', 'right', 'then', 'there', 'best', 'threesome', '2nd', 'disc', 'Notorious', 'CHO', 'wickidly', 'funny', 'not', 'as', 'so', 'previous', 'disc', 'last', 'one', 'Revolution', 'saw', 'first', 'time', 'last', 'night', 'was', 'funny', 'yet', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'former', '2', 'Actually', 'was', 'quite', 'dissapointed', 'Revolution', 'be', 'honest', 'did', 'laugh', 'more', 'few', 'times', 'could', 'always', 'control', 'ie', 'tears', 'uncotrollable', 'fits', 'laughter', 'knee', 'slaps', 'breathing', 'issues', 'seemed', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'Maybe', 'was', 'sick', 'something', 'appearance', 'little', 'different', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'lips', 'eyes', 'noticeably', 'lost', 'weight', 'as', 'well', 'voice', 'was', 'different', 'too', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'same', 'Margaret', 'fell', '1st', 'disc', 'summary', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'often', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'Revolution', 'other', '2', 'will', 'definitely', 'get', 'plenty', 'wear']",N/A
