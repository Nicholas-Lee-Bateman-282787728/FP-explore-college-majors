1663212,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00E00OGE2,Andrew Ellington,"[93, 105]","Seeing the trailer for `Turbo' a few months back I was rather determined that this was going to be one of those films I skipped entirely.  Then my girls caught wind up it and begged and pleaded and I thought, I'll rent it.  Then the film was released and they begged some more and I said ""let your grandma take you"" but for some reason I wound up sitting in a theater last night waiting for what I only assumed was going to be `Cars' with snails.`Turbo' is far from a truly intelligent or unique film, and yet it manages to be not only fun and engaging but charming to a point where I found myself completely entwined in the story and the characters.  The tried and true themes of `dreaming big' are not something new or untold with animated films.  Animated films, which are manufactured for children, are there to inspire confidence and help them to realize that they can do anything they set their mind to.  That is why in animated films, rats can cook, wimps can train dragons and snails can race cars.  Impossibilities exaggerate truths for kids and help them to `dream big', which is something we want for all of our kids.  Like I said, this is nothing new, and `Turbo' doesn't really even attempt to make it new, but it does handle its themes and premise with spunk and charm.The film tells the story of Theo, a worker snail who harvest tomatoes in a garden but watches Nascar at night, dreaming of one day being a racer.  The huge obstacle being that he is a snail and thus VERY slow.  Still, this and the fact that his antics cause turmoil within his social circle and ridicule from his fellow workers does not stop him from thinking outside of the box, and when a freak accident leaves everything in his slug-juice, Theo (aka Turbo) finally sees a light at the end of the tunnel.  When a down and out taco shop owner snatches up Theo and his brother for some snail racing his powers wow this small community and soon Theo finds himself racing in the Indie 500.I'll say this; I'm really happy that films like this, `Monsters University' and `The Croods' have developed stories with no true antagonist other than life's obstacles and so we aren't force feeding our children more and more stories about evil people doing evil things.  The chief antagonist in `Turbo' is the mere fact that Theo is a snail, with a fame hungry racecar driver playing a minor obstacle in the end.  There is no evil snail trying to kill him.  Sure, there is some `Sid-like' kid that lives across the street who likes to crush snails on his bike, but he's not evil but merely a toddler and it's played up for comic relief.Speaking of comic relief, `Turbo' is genuinely funny.  The voice work from the cast is great, with Oscar nominees Paul Giamatti, Samuel L. Jackson and Richard Jenkins spouting off alongside SNL alumni Bill Hader and Maya Rudolph with Snoop Dogg, Michael Pena, Michelle Rodriguez and Ken Jeong lending their talents as well.  Everyone hits their notes and makes a unified ensemble.  The sight gags (especially with the crows) are hilarious, and the use of music is rather inspired.  That spoof on the viral sensation of `I ain't got time for that' was one of the highlights of my movie year so far!So, with a surprised spirit I say ""GO SEE TURBO!!!""",4,That snail is fast!,1376524800,"08 15, 2013",2013,3255,"['Seeing', 'trailer', 'Turbo', 'few', 'months', 'back', 'was', 'rather', 'determined', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'one', 'films', 'skipped', 'entirely', 'Then', 'girls', 'caught', 'wind', 'begged', 'pleaded', 'thought', ""'ll"", 'rent', 'Then', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'begged', 'more', 'said', 'let', 'grandma', 'take', 'reason', 'wound', 'up', 'sitting', 'theater', 'last', 'night', 'waiting', 'what', 'only', 'assumed', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'Cars', 'snails.', 'Turbo', 'far', 'truly', 'intelligent', 'unique', 'film', 'yet', 'be', 'not', 'only', 'fun', 'engaging', 'charming', 'point', 'where', 'found', 'completely', 'entwined', 'story', 'characters', 'tried', 'true', 'themes', 'dreaming', 'big', ""'"", 'are', 'not', 'something', 'new', 'untold', 'animated', 'films', 'Animated', 'films', 'are', 'manufactured', 'children', 'are', 'there', 'inspire', 'confidence', 'help', 'realize', 'can', 'do', 'anything', 'set', 'mind', 'why', 'animated', 'films', 'rats', 'can', 'cook', 'wimps', 'can', 'train', 'dragons', 'snails', 'can', 'race', 'cars', 'Impossibilities', 'exaggerate', 'truths', 'kids', 'help', 'dream', 'big', ""'"", 'something', 'want', 'kids', 'said', 'nothing', 'new', 'Turbo', ""n't"", 'really', 'even', 'attempt', 'make', 'new', 'handle', 'themes', 'premise', 'spunk', 'charm.The', 'film', 'story', 'Theo', 'worker', 'snail', 'who', 'harvest', 'tomatoes', 'garden', 'Nascar', 'night', 'dreaming', 'one', 'day', 'being', 'racer', 'huge', 'obstacle', 'being', 'snail', 'thus', 'VERY', 'slow', 'Still', 'fact', 'antics', 'cause', 'turmoil', 'social', 'circle', 'ridicule', 'fellow', 'workers', 'not', 'stop', 'thinking', 'box', 'when', 'freak', 'accident', 'everything', 'slug-juice', 'Theo', 'Turbo', 'finally', 'light', 'end', 'tunnel', 'When', 'down', 'taco', 'shop', 'owner', 'up', 'Theo', 'brother', 'snail', 'racing', 'powers', 'wow', 'small', 'community', 'soon', 'Theo', 'racing', 'Indie', '500.I', ""'ll"", 'say', ""'m"", 'really', 'happy', 'films', 'Monsters', 'University', 'Croods', 'have', 'developed', 'stories', 'true', 'antagonist', 'other', 'life', 'obstacles', 'so', 'are', ""n't"", 'force', 'feeding', 'children', 'more', 'more', 'stories', 'evil', 'people', 'doing', 'evil', 'things', 'chief', 'antagonist', 'Turbo', 'mere', 'fact', 'Theo', 'snail', 'fame', 'hungry', 'racecar', 'driver', 'playing', 'minor', 'obstacle', 'end', 'evil', 'snail', 'trying', 'kill', 'Sure', 'Sid-like', 'kid', 'street', 'who', 'crush', 'snails', 'bike', 'not', 'evil', 'merely', 'toddler', 'played', 'up', 'comic', 'relief.Speaking', 'comic', 'relief', 'Turbo', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'voice', 'work', 'cast', 'great', 'Oscar', 'nominees', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'spouting', 'off', 'alongside', 'SNL', 'alumni', 'Bill', 'Hader', 'Maya', 'Rudolph', 'Snoop', 'Dogg', 'Michael', 'Pena', 'Michelle', 'Rodriguez', 'Ken', 'Jeong', 'lending', 'talents', 'well', 'Everyone', 'notes', 'unified', 'ensemble', 'sight', 'gags', 'especially', 'crows', 'are', 'hilarious', 'use', 'music', 'rather', 'inspired', 'spoof', 'viral', 'sensation', 'ai', ""n't"", 'got', 'time', 'was', 'one', 'highlights', 'movie', 'year', 'so', 'far', 'So', 'surprised', 'spirit', 'say', 'GO', 'SEE', 'TURBO']",N/A

1663216,A3LTZGHZBBBQX0,B00E00OGE2,Anthony L.,"[6, 8]","Turbo is an absolute, although harmless, miss.And I'm not just saying this for adult audiences. I watched Turbo with an audience of 8 kids, and not one of them really laughed, smiled, or showed anything more than remote interest. Virtually everything about this movie is misdirected and stale.First off, there's the ludicrous premise - a snail gets sucked into the engine of a dragster and magically gets headlights, a car alarm, and can go speeds upwards of 300 miles and hour. Turbo does not require audiences to suspend their disbelief, but hang it from a gibbet and throw the remains into the sea. When you can't relate to your main character, you aren't invested in the movie. When you aren't invested in the movie, the movie is bad.Second, there's the puzzlingly dark tone. Seriously, did this take place in Sin City or a charming kid's movie? Half the movie takes place in these dark scary, derelict slums, inhabited by strange characters that are not in the least bit reassuring for kids. The snails are not the worst of it; it's the humans that are the real miss for Turbo. As shown by my child audience, not ONE of the humans is remotely interesting or relateable.Third, there's the film's lazy tone. Turbo isn't even trying. At least Smurfs 2 - the worst cartoon of the year - was anything BUT lazy (and also devoid of ANY redeeming features). Turbo is content to creep along at a snails pace, without any sort of colour or life. The plot is as cliched as they ever come, meaning the movie is not remotely interesting. It has the old ""Follow your dreams/Wish upon a star/Dream big/You can do it"" sentimental, cliched trite coming out the wazoo.I could go on, talking about the poor attempts at puns, quirkiness, and sentimental ending, but really, this is a movie for kids. It shouldn't be dissected that much. But it's not a GOOD movie for kids - it fulfills the barest obligation for a kid's film - it's a harmless, moral-teaching, remotely interesting cartoon for kids that won't do them any harm. It won't do them much good, though, either.And one more thing; I noticed that both The Smurfs 2 and Turbo used the pun ""Snailed it"" at least once. These films happen to be the worst kids fare of the year. Maybe someone should have taken note.P.S. For some GOOD 2013 kids fare, seek out The Croods, Monster's University, Despicable Me 2, or Epic.

The animation is good, it's DreamWorks, they know what they're doing.  The voice acting is great with a huge cast of established stars who bring lots of personality to their characters (Ryan Reynolds, Paul Giamatti, Michael Pena, Samuel Jackson, Snoop Dog, Bill Hader... and more).Something else to keep in mind, possibly best of all, if it's a big hit with your kids and it comes into heavy rotation, it wont likely make you want to throw yourself into traffic.  In my humble opinion that is one of the most important aspects of any movie targeted at my kids.  How many times can it be on the background before I contemplate self injury to make the movie stop.  :)  There is enough going on that it's entertaining for adults as well.The movie absolutely shares many themes with Cars.  If it's a race animation picture... how could it not.

I was pleasantly surprised. Turbo turns out to be like most Dreamworks cartoons; entertaining for the kids without playing down to them, while still giving the adults a few things to chuckle at.Unlike most Dreamworks films, or most films at all actually, Turbo spends most of the film without a primary antagonist, and hence, without a deeper purpose. As a garden snail, he spends all day at his job at ""The Plant"" dreaming of racing. After work, he spends all night watching race cars and idolizing Guy Gagne, one of the top racers in Formula 1 (and, possibly a reference to Jean Girard of Talladega Nights, who is also a French racer who dominated F1 before taking over NASCAR).Without a real antagonist, Turbo is held down to earth by his brother, Chet (Paul Giamatti), who supervises him at work and tries to keep him rooted. When an accident at The Plant costs them both their jobs, Turbo ""runs"" away from home, and accidentally finds himself at the start of an underground race as a hood ornament. Yet another accident swoops him up into the engine of one of the cars just as the driver switches on the nitrous oxide, altering his DNA and turning him from a common garden snail into the fastest creature on no legs.So we've got a story. Now, onto the cast. Several other snails make appearances in the film. Whiplash is portrayed by Samuel L. Jackson, doing what Samuel L. Jackson does best: saying common sense things with a raised voice so they're funny. Snoop Dogg lends his voice to Smoove Moove, a thin, wiry snail who wears fuzzy dice around his neck. Michael Bell appears, and then disappears, as the White Shadow, a snail whose name is also his catchphrase. Maya Rudolph and Ben Schwartz round out the Starlight Snail Crew as Burn, a female snail who has a thing for Chet, and Skidmark, Whiplash's ""feisty #2."" Michael Pe&ntilde;a and Luis Guzm&aacute;n appear as the Lopez brothers, proprietors of the struggling taco stand Dos Bros. Tacos, who both have different ideas to revive it and mimic Turbo and Chet's relationship very closely.In spite of its lack of a villain for a good hour and twenty minutes, Turbo manages to do what it sets out to do: give kids and adults alike a little laugh and a little distraction. It also gives a hefty bit of inspiration in the form of Guy Gagne who delivers a quote from his father: ""No dream is too big, and no dreamer too small.""",4,That Snail Is Fast!,1376092800,"08 10, 2013",2013,2537,"['went', 'movie', 'zero', 'expectations', 'hoping', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'embarrassed', 'too', 'badly', 'Dreamworks', 'Animation', 'Studios', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'Turbo', 'out', 'be', 'most', 'Dreamworks', 'cartoons', 'entertaining', 'kids', 'playing', 'down', 'still', 'giving', 'adults', 'few', 'things', 'chuckle', 'most', 'Dreamworks', 'films', 'most', 'films', 'actually', 'Turbo', 'most', 'film', 'primary', 'antagonist', 'hence', 'deeper', 'purpose', 'garden', 'snail', 'day', 'job', 'Plant', 'dreaming', 'racing', 'work', 'night', 'watching', 'race', 'cars', 'idolizing', 'Guy', 'Gagne', 'one', 'top', 'racers', 'Formula', '1', 'possibly', 'reference', 'Jean', 'Girard', 'Talladega', 'Nights', 'who', 'also', 'French', 'racer', 'who', 'dominated', 'F1', 'taking', 'over', 'NASCAR', 'real', 'antagonist', 'Turbo', 'held', 'down', 'earth', 'brother', 'Chet', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'who', 'work', 'tries', 'keep', 'rooted', 'When', 'accident', 'Plant', 'jobs', 'Turbo', 'runs', 'away', 'home', 'accidentally', 'start', 'underground', 'race', 'hood', 'ornament', 'accident', 'up', 'engine', 'one', 'cars', 'just', 'driver', 'nitrous', 'oxide', 'altering', 'DNA', 'turning', 'common', 'garden', 'snail', 'fastest', 'creature', 'legs.So', ""'ve"", 'got', 'story', 'Now', 'cast', 'Several', 'other', 'snails', 'make', 'appearances', 'film', 'Whiplash', 'portrayed', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'doing', 'what', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'best', 'saying', 'common', 'sense', 'things', 'raised', 'voice', ""'re"", 'funny', 'Snoop', 'Dogg', 'voice', 'Smoove', 'Moove', 'thin', 'wiry', 'snail', 'who', 'fuzzy', 'dice', 'neck', 'Michael', 'Bell', 'then', 'disappears', 'White', 'Shadow', 'snail', 'name', 'also', 'catchphrase', 'Maya', 'Rudolph', 'Ben', 'Schwartz', 'round', 'out', 'Starlight', 'Snail', 'Crew', 'Burn', 'female', 'snail', 'who', 'thing', 'Chet', 'Skidmark', 'Whiplash', 'feisty', '2', 'Michael', 'Pe', 'ntilde', 'Luis', 'Guzm', 'aacute', 'appear', 'Lopez', 'brothers', 'proprietors', 'struggling', 'taco', 'stand', 'Dos', 'Bros.', 'Tacos', 'who', 'have', 'different', 'ideas', 'revive', 'mimic', 'Turbo', 'Chet', 'relationship', 'very', 'closely.In', 'spite', 'lack', 'villain', 'good', 'hour', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'Turbo', 'do', 'what', 'out', 'do', 'give', 'kids', 'adults', 'little', 'laugh', 'little', 'distraction', 'also', 'hefty', 'bit', 'inspiration', 'form', 'Guy', 'Gagne', 'who', 'quote', 'father', 'dream', 'too', 'big', 'dreamer', 'too', 'small']",N/A

The movie is hugely predictable and throws in big plot elements that can literally break the movie into pieces, But the way the movie did the racing scenes was put into the movie like a work of pure Art. The Animation is so vibrant, The movie although telling from the point of view from snails looks very vibrant, It also looks a bit to much like a rip-off of A Bug's Life but as it is , its very fantastic animation. The movie handles the racing scenes spectacularly because of the right tone needed to animate racing scenes and has fast animation that is animated fantastically. The Characters are poorly written , they have very fun personalities and have nice voice acting and they are pretty well-developed. Overall , Turbo is on the low end for Dreamworks films, but at least it was not the terrible movie it looked like. 3/5 stars!",3,Not the best but all right,1374192000,"07 19, 2013",2013,1280,"['Dreamworks', 'have', 'been', 'such', 'roll', 'Turbo', 'was', 'Dreamworks', 'movie', 'really', 'disappointed', 'people', 'Dreamworks', 'made', 'great', 'films', 'Puss', 'Boots', 'How', 'Train', 'Your', 'Dragons', 'Madagascar', '3', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'Panda', '2', 'Rise', 'Guardians', 'When', 'Croods', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'worry', 'people', 'Dreamworks', 'was', 'going', 'downhill', 'films', 'will', 'make', 'now', 'pretty', 'clear', 'Turbo', 'made', 'worries', 'become', 'reality', 'movie', 'hugely', 'predictable', 'big', 'plot', 'elements', 'can', 'literally', 'break', 'movie', 'pieces', 'way', 'movie', 'did', 'racing', 'scenes', 'was', 'put', 'movie', 'work', 'pure', 'Art', 'Animation', 'so', 'vibrant', 'movie', 'telling', 'point', 'view', 'snails', 'very', 'vibrant', 'also', 'bit', 'much', 'rip-off', 'A', 'Bug', 'Life', 'very', 'fantastic', 'animation', 'movie', 'racing', 'scenes', 'spectacularly', 'right', 'tone', 'needed', 'animate', 'racing', 'scenes', 'fast', 'animation', 'animated', 'fantastically', 'Characters', 'are', 'poorly', 'written', 'have', 'very', 'fun', 'personalities', 'have', 'nice', 'voice', 'acting', 'are', 'pretty', 'well-developed', 'Overall', 'Turbo', 'low', 'end', 'Dreamworks', 'films', 'least', 'was', 'not', 'terrible', 'movie', 'looked', '3/5', 'stars']",N/A

1663271,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00E00OGE2,FNDNreview,"[9, 15]","The release of animated features has become more and more frequent.  With so much more competition, Disney is no longer the biggest kid on the playground.  Quite to the contrary, there are several kids on the playground - and they're all roughly the same size.  Illumination Entertainment has had major hits on its hands with the Despicable Me films and Dr. Seuss' The Lorax, while Sony Pictures Animation has cashed in with Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs and its revitalization of The Smurfs.  Still, no film studio has made more animated films than The Walt Disney Company, which also includes its vast library and the popular Pixar branch.  However, if there's one studio that has rivaled the success of Disney in recent years, it's DreamWorks Animation.  DreamWorks is responsible for such hits as Shrek, Madagascar, Kung Fu Panda, and The Croods.  And, the odds are DreamWorks will have another successful moneymaker on its hands with the sports comedy, Turbo.Turbo stars the voice of Ryan Reynolds as Theo/Turbo, an average snail with an obsession for speed.  Theo never seems to be able to do anything right, spending most of his time watching racing videos on television and pretending he's a race car driver.  Theo's brother, Chet (Paul Giamatti), rejects his brother's obsession, believing he should spend more time focused on working at the tomato planet.  However, unforeseen events cause Theo to come into contact with nitrous oxide, which empowers him to move at extraordinary speeds.  Now going by the name ""Turbo,"" and working in an unlikely partnership with Tito (Michael Pe&ntilde;a), a Taco stand owner, Turbo is entered into the Indianapolis 500 - where he must go head-to-head with his idol, Indy car driver, Guy Gagn&eacute; (Bill Hader).  The voices of Samuel L. Jackson, Ken Jeong, Michelle Rodriguez, and Snoop Dogg also star in supporting roles.To be honest, Turbo leaves a great deal to be desired in comparison to other popular animated films, like Toy Story or Monsters Inc.  While there's very little doubt this film will go over extremely well with kids, it lacks charming, likeable characters.  Ryan Reynolds has gone stale in Hollywood, so it makes sense that he's doing voice work in an animated feature.  At the same time, there's no better actor in Hollywood than Paul Giamatti, so it's a bit of a waste of talent for him to be dong voice work in a supporting role.  Speaking of supporting roles, the supporting cast is not remotely entertaining enough in comparison to the supporting cast of films like Madagascar, Toy Story, or even another DreamWorks film, Rise of the Guardians.  Their quips are tiresome, often lame and leave a gaping role where the comedy should have been.  However, there are brief seconds of humor from Ken Jeong, who portrays a woman shopkeeper.  Sadly, those lines were already used in the film's trailer and were basically good for nothing more than a quick chuckle.Regardless of this film's numerous shortcomings, there's a great deal to admire about Turbo's character.  He's an imaginative, driven character that shoots for the stars.  Still, his hardships in life feel a bit lackluster, making it hard to relate to the character - especially since his biggest disappointment is being unable to save a tomato from a lawnmower (yawn).  By sheer dumb luck, he winds up with these ""Flash-like"" powers from an accident and from there on out, it never feels like he's properly challenged.  As much as the plot tries to bring him down in order to build him back up for the climax, Turbo is essentially the Michael Jordan of snail racing (or Mario Andretti if you want to stick with racing) - without a proper ""villainous"" competitor.  And, by the time he does have a villain to compete with - the film is basically over and the interest level in the plot has long since faded.  Perhaps another super-powered snail would have made for a proper villain, instead of using the Indy 500 landscape and actual race cars.  Including the Indy car series just diluted the film even more, making it feel like a giant advertisement for the race (not to mention Chevy's logo is all over the film, too).The bright spot of the film is surely that quality of animation (plus the song selections are pretty excellent).  It never gets old seeing what these major animation companies can achieve with their authentic, yet cartoon-ish styles.  At certain points of the film (mainly during the racing scenes), if you had a controller in your hand, you'd swear you were playing a racing game on the big screen (which would be incredibly fun come to think of it).  Unfortunately, there's just something that's boring about starring at animated snails and a taco vendor for 90 minutes.  But, if you're someone that has ever dreamt of what a Fast & Furious animated feature would look like, the drag racing scene will at least feed your imagination in that regard.Overall, there's very little doubt that kids will find a great deal of enjoyment from this film and if you're a parent wondering whether this film is suitable for them - the easy answers is yes, absolutely.  As far as adults or teens go, there's hardly any humor or meaningful entertainment to be found in this flick.  This film is completely average - nothing more, nothing less.  Films like Despicable Me and Toy Story (which are the golden standard in animation if you haven't gotten that impression already) provide for a high to moderate amount of humor for both kids and adults.  In the case of Turbo, the entertainment value for adults just isn't there.  In the end, this film is strictly for kids through and through.  Walking out of the theater, it will be easy for most to label this film as ""cute"" and if you're a parent, you'll quickly come to the conclusion that one day this film will most likely be on your shelf collecting dust (along with the countless other animated movies) as soon as it hits home video.Grade:  C-FNDNreview.com",3,"'Turbo' a kid-friendly, average animated feature",1374019200,"07 17,

The colorful characters are funny as they come to life, sound effects are totally awesome, and the children found it very entertaining from start to finish, as well as the adult viewers who enjoy animated. My daughter also loves animated, and wants to view this movie again. She compares this movie to several Disney favorites, and rates this one excellent, for story and characters. We will indeed be watching it again-and-again, as we do all our favorites. The theme of this delightful animated feature is snails and speed, which never went well together. The message is that we can all follow our dreams, and hope for the best. Theo is different, because he wants to race cars, instead of gardening. His family tries to convince him to work in the garden, where he belongs. But, he never quits on his dream. After he turns into a speed machine, the movie becomes more exciting.

Directed by David Soren (Merry Madagascar) who also co-wrote this film with Darren Lemke (Jack The Giant Slayer, Shrek Foreverafter) and Robert D. Segal (The Wrestler, The Onion Movie). It starts and stay a ittle bit too long in first gear for the first 20 minutes, but then it picks up is pace and we'll have you laughing, cheering and sniffling a lot all the way to the end!With such a heartfelt well-rounded cast, it has Ryan Reynolds (The Green Lantern, The Proposal) cast an over ambitious and extremely wishful snail wanting to be the fastest snail in the world. All he wants is to just enter, and  of course win, the Indy 500. (Yes, he's a snail. Shell and all!) Now of course all his fellow snail friends and co-workers  in the garden he works atand especially his brother Chet,  voiced brilliantly by Paul Giamotti (Sideways, The Illusionist), all have a poor and somewhat pathetic opinion of Turbo.By an act of nature (or chance) and the imaginary champion racer in his head Gay Gagne, voiced and performed artistically by Bill Hader (Suberbad, SNL), he is depressed and discouraged to the point where he teeters over an LA freeway in his rejection. Accidently falling and `fueling' his DNA up with some Turbo charged fluid after falling into a car he becomes FAST. Literally fast. Exceeding speeds of over 100 miles an hour! Now he Is kidnapped by a pair of Mexican brothers for `snail racing'.The story then moves in a parallel line with that of two Mexican brothers (Tito and Angelo) trying to keep a Taco business alive in Van Nuys, CA. The older brother is having a tough time making ends meet while the younger brother keeps coming up with crazy schemes that never quite hit the mark. Tito is voiced sincerely by Michael Pena (The Shooter) who finds and really believes in Turbo and Angelo is voiced by Luis Guzman (Boogie Nights) who is more than skeptical of everything his brother does.Enter literally a ""gang"" of snail that will not only encourage and motivate Turbo into pursuing and getting his dream of racing in the Indy 500, but then even help and push him into new heights of both latitude and of the heart. Samuel L. Jackson (Django, The Incredibles) leads the pack as pack with some hysterical sidekicks like Snoop Dog (Bruno), Maya Rudolph (Bridesmaid) as Burn, Ben Schwartz (House of Lies) as Skidmark, Richard Jenkins (Jack Reacher) as Bobby.The story, as you guessed it, allows turbo to enter the Indy 500 and the rest is fast paced, intrigue, drama, action and a lot of near misses because his hero Guy is not quite a man you want anyone to look up too. The real villain is having a low self-esteem in yourself will only hold you back, however when his idol turns out to be something a lot less than he expected, Turbo's heart and drive is literally broken!The movie is fun and it has a lot of California, specifically LA references that will crack you up! The racing sequences are amazing and the whole movie is very colorful just make sure you bring a tissue or two for the end. You'll probably want go and hug all your family members after the movie. This is for the family of all ages I loved this one!

1663340,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B00E00OGE2,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[0, 1]","WARNING: This review contains so-called &#34;spoilers.&#34; I say &#34;so-called&#34; because I find it hard to believe that anyone could watch this film and not figure out what's going to happen, but I guess you never know. So, consider yourself warned.Before I talk about the story, let me discuss what works in the film: This movie is visually gorgeous. I don't watch a lot of animated films, so it's sometimes breath-taking for me to sit down with one and see just how far computer rendering has come since the last one I saw. The detail and perspective and just overall look of this movie is fantastic. Also, as a children's film, the overall plot is simple enough, the various jokes cartoonish enough, and the pacing revved up enough to keep a kid's attention for the film's 90 minutes. You'll also probably have kids clamoring for the inevitable line of toys (racing accessories sold separately?) that this movie seemed designed to market.However, if you have a kid that thinks too hard about stories, or if you're just an adult looking for some eye candy, the film is a weak, watery, predictable mess. Let me count the ways.1. Our main character is a snail who has named himself Turbo. Turbo has an unstoppable desire to be fast, hopefully someday fast enough to join the Indy 500. His brother, Paul Giamatti, rightly thinks this is a stupid dream, and grows ever frustrated as Turbo constantly puts himself and other snails in danger with his head-in-the-cloud fantasies. Other than this, Turbo has no personality traits at all.2. In a (suicidal?) malaise, Turbo accidentally gets sucked into a street racing car and is given a nitrous oxide bath, he develops the ability to move hundreds of miles an hour, and also gains headlights, a car/shell alarm, and a pretty powerful radio/sound system. Should we ignore the disturbing implication that Turbo is only able to achieve his dreams with the help of magic speed juice? Should we ignore the logical problems with a snail suddenly getting blinkers? Let's.3. Turbo is discovered by a struggling taco salesman, a chubby Mexican guy (sigh) named Tito. He runs the taco business with his level-headed brother, Angelo. When Tito discovers Turbo can move hundreds of miles an hour, leaving an unreal, blue phosphorous trail in his wake, he tries to get Turbo entered into the Indy 500. Angelo disapproves, giving us our movie's first theme: brothers suck. That's right, even though Turbo has an unreal, otherworldly power, neither Angelo nor Paul Giamatti are impressed and still think Turbo is a lost cause. This is where the movie started to lose me. I mean, come on. I just willingly allowed that a snail morphed into a tiny car. Now you want me to believe that this is not going to be a big deal to EVERYONE IN THE WORLD?But of course it's not, because otherwise the movie wouldn't be able to hopscotch neatly through every &#34;follow your dream&#34; cliche in the book, including fighting against the people who are constantly saying &#34;you can't do it.&#34; But, of course, Turbo COULDN'T do it. Not until he got injected with that powerful chemical that ... oh, yeah. I said I was going to ignore that.Ahem.So, encountering resistance every step of the way, Turbo finally makes it to the Indy 500 to race alongside his racing idol, Bill Hader (doing the best job out of any of the actors). Turns out Bill is secretly a jerk -- surprise, surprise -- and tries to kill Turbo during the race in front of the whole world. There's a huge pile-up in the process, and Turbo's shell gets cracked and -- uh oh! -- he loses his magic powers right at the end of the race! But what's this? Paul Giamatti finally believes in his brother, and he delivers a big speech about how the power was in Turbo all along, and Turbo inches across the finish line under his own speed, narrowly avoiding being crushed by the livid Bill Hader.And I call &#34;boo.&#34; The movie tries to shoehorn this message of self-empowerment at the end as if that was what it was meaning to teach all along, but it makes absolutely no sense in light of the rest of the film. &#34;Follow your dreams no matter what anyone says! You have it in you!&#34; the movie pretends to be saying, while subtly adding &#34;as long as you get a little help from a wishing star and glowing blue fluids.&#34; There are so many other plot turns and twists, so many other story avenues that a mutant speed snail movie could've taken, but this film takes the safest, oldest, and dumbest one of all. And it doesn't even do it consistently! At the end, for no reason other than because kids will certainly want it to happen, Turbo has his powers back. How did that happen? Who knows? He also has a cadre of snail friends with different morphing shells that didn't exist before. Why?Oh, that's right. Toys.A brainless, shameless attempt to market merchandise alongside a moral message that the movie only half-believes in, TURBO is only enjoyable on the shallowest of levels. Oh, and -- I can't get past it -- I'm pretty sure it's the first pro-steroids kids' film I've ever seen.",3,Finally!

1663352,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B00E00OGE2,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[1, 2]","It only struck me recently that now that I have a five-year-old I could take him to pretty much any kid's movie under the slightest pretense.  This is exhilarating -- I hadn't read up too much on what ""Turbo"" was about besides the fact it featured...ya know, a snail. And that's pretty much what I got.Here's what you need to know: ""Turbo"" is actually about brotherly relationships.  Snail Theo (Ryan Reynolds) dreams of becoming a race car driver like his hero Guy Gagne (Bill Hader); his workaday brother Chet (Paul Giamatti) disapproves.  They have good jobs in a human family's tomato garden, but it regularly involves being carried off (AKA eaten) by realistically-rendered crows.  My son was unfazed by this, so mission accomplished.When a freak accident transforms Theo from a hopeful snail to speed demon Turbo with a pimped-out shell, things take a surprising turn.  Instead of following the typical superhero plot by trying to hide his special nature from adults (read: humans), Turbo immediately embraces his new superpowers and becomes the literal and figurative vehicle that propels another plot: two human brothers trying to make it big.Dreamer Tito (Michael Pena) believes Turbo can enter the Indy 500 and bring fortune and fame to the Starlight Plaza while his more practical brother Angelo (Luis Guzman) harangues him for not making tacos.  Rounding out the human population is a parade of ethnic stereotypes: tough autobody shop owner Paz (Michelle Rodriguez), hobby store owner Bobby (Richard Jenkins), and most offensive of all, nail salon owner Kim Ly (Ken Jeong, pretending to be a little old fat woman). But never mind that, this is a movie with urban heart -- and we know that because it has Snoop Dogg as snail Smoove Move.The Starlight gang decides to escalate to switch from snail racing to the real thing.  Yes kids, this is a real thing. And so the humans pool their money and go on a road trip to get Turbo entered into the Indy 500, accompanied by kooky supporting snails: Whiplash (Samuel L. Jackson), Burn (Maya Rudolph), Skidmark (Ben Schwartz) and White Shadow (Mike Bell). These snails are a crazy catalyst to push the plot along when things get boring.Surprisingly enough, it works. Between the point-of-view car racing, the insane snail antics, and the occasional harangue by an older brother who knows better (snail or otherwise), ""Turbo"" speeds along at a good clip.  It's also the first movie that kept the boy's attention through the entire film.There's quite a bit of naive optimism in ""Turbo"" that goes unspoken.  Nobody ever shows up to dissect Turbo even though he's plastered all over television.  And although technically Tito is out to exploit Turbo for cash, it feels more like two hopeless romantics helping each other achieve their dreams.  ""Turbo's"" conclusion is a surprisingly close race that plays for keeps -- which is saying a lot for a film about a superpowered snail in the Indy 500.Hobby fans will be amused by Bobby's comment that the Indy 500 is ""bigger than Hobbycon!"" Or bigger than Gen Con, which takes place in Indianapolis too.  And kids...well don't take my word for it. My son said it was his favorite movie.  He's looking forward to the upcoming television series spinoff.",4,Turbo-tastic!,1374451200,"07 22, 2013",2013,3243,"['only', 'struck', 'recently', 'now', 'have', 'five-year-old', 'could', 'take', 'pretty', 'much', 'kid', 'movie', 'slightest', 'pretense', 'exhilarating', 'had', ""n't"", 'read', 'up', 'too', 'much', 'what', 'Turbo', 'was', 'fact', 'featured', 'ya', 'know', 'snail', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'got.Here', 'what', 'need', 'know', 'Turbo', 'actually', 'about', 'brotherly', 'relationships', 'Snail', 'Theo', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'dreams', 'becoming', 'race', 'car', 'driver', 'hero', 'Guy', 'Gagne', 'Bill', 'Hader', 'workaday', 'brother', 'Chet', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'have', 'good', 'jobs', 'human', 'family', 'tomato', 'garden', 'regularly', 'being', 'carried', 'AKA', 'eaten', 'realistically-rendered', 'crows', 'son', 'was', 'unfazed', 'mission', 'freak', 'accident', 'transforms', 'Theo', 'hopeful', 'snail', 'speed', 'demon', 'Turbo', 'pimped-out', 'shell', 'things', 'take', 'surprising', 'turn', 'Instead', 'following', 'typical', 'superhero', 'plot', 'trying', 'hide', 'special', 'nature', 'adults', 'read', 'humans', 'Turbo', 'immediately', 'new', 'superpowers', 'literal', 'figurative', 'vehicle', 'plot', 'two', 'human', 'brothers', 'trying', 'make', 'big.Dreamer', 'Tito', 'Michael', 'Pena', 'Turbo', 'can', 'enter', 'Indy', '500', 'bring', 'fortune', 'fame', 'Starlight', 'Plaza', 'more', 'practical', 'brother', 'Angelo', 'Luis', 'Guzman', 'not', 'making', 'tacos', 'Rounding', 'out', 'human', 'population', 'parade', 'ethnic', 'stereotypes', 'tough', 'autobody', 'shop', 'owner', 'Paz', 'Michelle', 'Rodriguez', 'hobby', 'store', 'owner', 'Bobby', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'most', 'offensive', 'nail', 'salon', 'owner', 'Kim', 'Ly', 'Ken', 'Jeong', 'pretending', 'be', 'little', 'old', 'fat', 'woman', 'never', 'mind', 'movie', 'urban', 'heart', 'know', 'Snoop', 'Dogg', 'snail', 'Smoove', 'Move.The', 'Starlight', 'gang', 'decides', 'escalate', 'switch', 'snail', 'racing', 'real', 'thing', 'Yes', 'kids', 'real', 'thing', 'so', 'humans', 'pool', 'money', 'go', 'road', 'trip', 'get', 'Turbo', 'entered', 'Indy', '500', 'accompanied', 'kooky', 'supporting', 'snails', 'Whiplash', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'Burn', 'Maya', 'Rudolph', 'Skidmark', 'Ben', 'Schwartz', 'White', 'Shadow', 'Mike', 'Bell', 'snails', 'are', 'crazy', 'catalyst', 'push', 'plot', 'when', 'things', 'get', 'boring.Surprisingly', 'enough', 'point-of-view', 'car', 'racing', 'insane', 'snail', 'antics', 'occasional', 'harangue', 'older', 'brother', 'who', 'better', 'snail', 'otherwise', 'Turbo', 'along', 'good', 'clip', 'also', 'first', 'movie', 'kept', 'boy', 'attention', 'entire', 'film.There', 'quite', 'bit', 'naive', 'optimism', 'Turbo', 'unspoken', 'Nobody', 'ever', 'up', 'dissect', 'Turbo', 'even', 'plastered', 'television', 'technically', 'Tito', 'out', 'exploit', 'Turbo', 'cash', 'more', 'two', 'hopeless', 'romantics', 'helping', 'other', 'achieve', 'dreams', 'Turbo', 'conclusion', 'surprisingly', 'close', 'race', 'keeps', 'saying', 'lot', 'film', 'superpowered', 'snail', 'Indy', '500.Hobby', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'amused', 'Bobby', 'comment', 'Indy', '500', 'bigger', 'Hobbycon', 'bigger', 'Gen', 'Con', 'place', 'Indianapolis', 'too', 'kids', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'word', 'My', 'son', 'said', 'was', 'favorite', 'movie', 'looking', 'forward', 'upcoming', 'television', 'series', 'spinoff']",N/A

Oleson,"[32, 43]","Even an old fart like me can appreciate animated films aimed at kids, so when my grown son and his wife decided it was time to take my 2 year old grandson to his first movie, I got to come along.  The youngster is fascinated with cars, speed, color and reckless behavior.  In other words a typical 2 year old boy.In this DreamWorks production, Turbo (Ryan Reynolds) is a snail fascinated by the Indianapolis 500.  His goal is to break the world record by covering a meter in a day or something.  His brother Chet (Paul Giamatti) tries to tell him he's not going to ever be fast, but Turbo isn't convinced and often rebels at his regular job of harvesting tomatoes.  In a freakish accident Turbo is ingested into the engine of a street drag racer and while circulating among the pistons, inhales a goodly amount of Nitro methane injected into the fuel line.  Magically, rather than by being killed, the poor mollusk takes on super snail speed.  Enough speed that he can keep up with Indy cars.With help from a Van Nuys taco bender named Tito (Michael Pena) and some obviously more hip snails he meets (Samuel L. Jackson, Snoop Dogg, Maya Rudolph, Michelle Rodriguez, and Mike Bell) off they go to register for the 500.  Once there he has to confront his hero and great French driver Guy Gagne (Bill Hader).  As you would expect they have a mighty duel for 500 miles and an unsurprising finish.""Turbo"" is a bit light on adult humor but the kids are going to love it.  As for my grandson, he and I were pretty much on the same page.  When there was a lot of talking (human morals and expectations transferred to garden creatures) we were a bit antsy.

1663371,A2DLKD4AC5JV5Q,B00E00OGE2,Ranny Levy,"[25, 29]","Below are reviews by two of our youth film critics, one from a 15-year-old and one from an 11-year-old.Geared towards kids under the age of 10, ""Turbo"" will be sure to have kids delighted and cheering the snails on. However, the excitement merely lingers for a short while, just like the exhaust trail from a racecar speeding by.For a movie about racing snails, ""Turbo"" isn't half as bad as I thought it would be. Although initially skeptical, I changed my mind for the better because of the movie's amusing wit and heart. A normal garden snail named Theo has big dreams of being the fastest racer in the world.  His brother, Chet, sees Theo's dream as nonsense and a distraction to their work in the garden. One day, a freak accident involving Nitrous Oxide changes Theo to Turbo. Suddenly this snail has the abilities of a car - headlights, a stereo, and of course, unparalleled speed powers! A Mexican taco seller, who shares the same dreams as Turbo, enters the snail in the Indy 500. On his journey to the greatest car race in the world, Turbo befriends a gang of smooth cool snails (you'll never look at snails the same way again) and meets his rival, the menacing racer, world-renowned Guy Gagne.The plot is straightforward and simple, mixed in with heart-warming feel-good morals typical of underdog family-friendly animated genres. ""Dream big!"" the film seems to shout at every turn.  I could have done without highlighting the message quite so much. Although ""Turbo"" starts off slow, it gradually begins to pick up speed. The filmmakers also could have included more brother bonding moments between Turbo and Chet.The voice-overs are solid, especially Ryan Reynolds' Turbo and Paul Giamatti's Chet. The snail gang is hilarious, voiced by Maya Rudolph, Ben Schwartz, Kurtwood Smith, Snoop Dogg and Samuel L. Jackson. Unlike Blue Sky Studio's ""Epic"" that came out earlier this year, DreamWorks hired big names not because of their celebrity status, but because their voices actually fit the slick, suave characters.At its best, ""Turbo"" is a heart-pounding inspiring flick, perfect to keep kids entertained. ""Turbo"" isn't going to make its way into my evergreen library but certainly this family-friendly film will grab the kids' attention long enough to give parents a much needed summer break.  The 3D is impressive! I felt like I was really racing alongside the snails. The film offers a snails-eye view, an interesting perspective especially while racing. ""Turbo"" can't be compared to Pixar's movies, but even so, it's a rip-roaring adventure. Reviewed by Cassandra H., KIDS FIRST! Film CriticI loved the movie ""Turbo!"" It is really fun and must have been an awesome movie to act in. This movie is an animated film about super-speed snail racing and features the voices of many different actors. Turbo is a lonely garden snail who is about to gain super speed powers and will race in the ""Indy 500"" which is meant for cars but, his amigo Tito didn't take ""no"" for an answer.This is a fast-action movie where Turbo, who watches a speed race every night and idolizes Guy Gangn&egrave; who is the national champion racer. Turbo memorizes every line he says as well as the commercial for the drink: Adrenolade. One day, when he is working in the garden, a ""big red"" tomato falls on the other side of the garden where the lawn is being mowed. Turbo is so slow that he imagines he is the racer racing for the ""big red"" tomato. He does not make it to the tomato but he still goes on his own journey in the rain all alone. This is when everything starts to happen and Turbo receives his powers by a racing car's kind of gas.The main characters are Turbo the snail (Ryan Reynolds), Tito (Michael Pena), Chet  (Paul Giammati), White Shadow (Michael Bell), Whiplash (Samuel L. Jackson), Smoove Mov (Snoop Dogg), Burn (Maya Rudolph) and  Skid Mark (Ben Swartz). All these characters are great but my favorite and the one that stands out the most is Chet because he was pretty annoying and he is the one that puts most of the negativity into the movie.  I thought it was really cool how the writer did that.My favorite part is near the end where after Turbo loses all of his powers and then tries racing again at Dos Bros Tacos for everyone to see. All of a sudden, when it is almost time to race he gets all of his powers back in an amazing magical moment and it is really nice and cool. Turbo is really happy that he gains back his powers and speed.I recommend the movie to all ages for anyone who loves action-filled adventures and having fun. I also found this movie very cool and safe for children to watch. It has very funny characters and scenes. The moral of this story is that even though you are a small snail and have big dreams, you can do anything you set your mind to.Reviewed by Stacy-Love B, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

Zwick,"[1, 1]","One of the risks with having too much of a particular type of movie is that eventually you have to start stretching for ideas just to keep the audience coming back for more. That seems to be happening to some extent with the seemingly ubiquitous family-friendly animated feature, where the plotlines have become a tad farfetched even for anything-goes CGI animation.Take &#8220;Turbo,&#8221; for instance, a tale of a NASCAR-loving snail (!) who dreams of one day competing in the Indianapolis 500. After he&#8217;s accidentally exposed to a massive dose of nitric oxide, Theo becomes a turbocharged speed machine capable of clocking in at 200+ m.p.h.. When he&#8217;s &#8220;discovered&#8221; by Tito, a husky L.A. taco vendor who sees Theo&#8217;s potential as a racer, the snail&#8217;s dream gets one step closer to becoming a reality.The good news is that those who made the film - writer/director David Soren, co-scenarists Robert Siegel and Darren Lemke -- have the talent and conviction to bring the concept home. With an underdog racing plot very similar to the one in &#8220;Planes,&#8221; &#8220;Turbo&#8221; is a sweet, fast-paced and visually elegant film that knows how to move and how to mix humor and sentiment in roughly equal measure. The race sequences are so good that you realize while you&#8217;re watching them that they owe as much to &#8220;Ben-Hur&#8221; as to any racecar picture - which is very high praise indeed.With voice work by Ryan Reynolds, Paul Giamatti, Michael Pena, Samuel L.
