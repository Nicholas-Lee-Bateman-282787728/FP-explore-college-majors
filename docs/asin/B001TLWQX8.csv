The show itself was thoroughly entertaining. Jose and his band were outstanding, to say the least. He is quite a talented performer and this blu ray disc is a keeper and one I will look forward to viewing many times.",5,FANTASTIC!,1261785600,"12 26, 2009",2009,343,"['concert', 'was', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'start', 'finish', 'audio', 'was', 'crisp', 'clear', 'video', 'images', 'were', 'razor', 'sharp', 'show', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'entertaining', 'Jose', 'band', 'were', 'outstanding', 'say', 'least', 'quite', 'talented', 'performer', 'blu', 'ray', 'disc', 'keeper', 'one', 'will', 'look', 'forward', 'viewing', 'many', 'times']",N/A

Doesn't contain any of his newer songs but has some nice versions of classic Santana and other performer's songs. IMO, as good as he sounds in English, I still feel his best work is his Spanish ballads which this disc has only one.",4,Newer Feliciano Concert,1350691200,"10 20, 2012",2012,321,"['Good', 'quality', 'video', 'audio', 'Not', 'favorite', 'Jose', 'Feliciano', 'disc', 'pretty', 'good', 'anyway', ""n't"", 'contain', 'newer', 'songs', 'nice', 'versions', 'classic', 'Santana', 'other', 'performer', 'songs', 'IMO', 'as', 'good', 'English', 'still', 'feel', 'best', 'work', 'Spanish', 'ballads', 'disc', 'only', 'one']",N/A

Completely engulfed me and brought back loads of memories. Starts out with Chico and the Man, includes a cool rendition of Billy Jean, with some hard rock stuff. Such versatility! he's an odd performer in that he gives little facial or body expression of movement. Finger work is the ""working man's"" style and it is quite stunning how fast he can go.",5,"Really, really, good.",1295740800,"01 23, 2011",2011,426,"['must', 'see', 'opinion', 'crazy', 'heart', 'number', 'loved', 'Completely', 'brought', 'back', 'loads', 'memories', 'out', 'Chico', 'Man', 'cool', 'rendition', 'Billy', 'Jean', 'hard', 'rock', 'stuff', 'Such', 'versatility', 'odd', 'performer', 'little', 'facial', 'body', 'expression', 'movement', 'Finger', 'work', 'working', 'man', 'style', 'quite', 'stunning', 'how', 'fast', 'can', 'go']",N/A
