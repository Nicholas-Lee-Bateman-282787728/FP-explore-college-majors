I'm pretty uncoordinated myself and I didn't have much trouble following the cardio moves, but that being said, I just didn't feel like I got that great of a workout.  Once that part was over I mainly felt like I could have worked much harder.  Frankly I felt like my heart rate was up much more in the strength section.  I don't know if it's just me but when I do squats and lunges I get sweaty and my heart rate goes up.  Anyway, I found the warm up pretty dull and almost turned it off.  The cardio was OK if you're trying to take it easy.  But the strength and core sections were very good.  My shoulders are by far the weakest part of my upper body and I had to stick with 5lb weights the whole workout instead of switching to 8lbs like I thought I would.  The core section was also good - although I do wish she would have done more reps for some of the exercises.

1112052,A17V9XL4CWTQ6G,B000WTVZ4Y,Chandler,"[16, 16]","CALORIC BURN: First I'll touch on the caloric burn of the dvd because that's, after all, the biggest need I have in a fitness dvd. I workout daily to a large library of exercise dvds that I've collected over the years in order to keep it interesting and new with varied trainers, sets, music, and routines that challenge different muscles. I measure the caloric burn of a dvd by wearing a bodybugg which tells me not only how many calories I burn per day, but also during a workout including how many calories are burned per minute during that workout. I mention this only so you know what I say is based upon scientific measurement rather than perceived exertion. The calorie burn was very high on this dvd with one of the higher measures of caloric burn per minute from my collection.But better yet, I didn't feel ""wiped out"" by doing it. It was energizing and many of the moves were unique.ROUTINES INCLUDED: The dvd contains 3 different workouts, a high energy cardio with some fun sports-based moves (dont let that scare you off...I was picked last for p.e. teams during my entire childhood and couldn't do a sport aside from skiing, watersports, and iceskating to save my life)...but it made it fun to move three steps than lunge foreward with a raquetless hand as though swiping a ball. In all honesty this was similar to a kickboxing move with the same upper and lower body cardio results...but was fun and new to learn within the routine. Also during the warm up to do a tai chi move called ""moving water""...just new things I'd never done before in spite of this being my primary method of fitness...moves with the backstroke as in swimming are another example...I like that.  Fu with good results. Also it has a strength training and balance session and then the next segment is strictly for core and abs.CUEING: She's a pro at cueing. She reaaaaally ensures you know just what's coming up and that you get the steps down with your feet before hand movements are added in during the aerobics.MUSIC;The music is some of the best I've heard as far as being in sync with the routine. It moves to the beat of the movement but then when the instructor starts going faster and into a more rigorous part of the routine the music is more dramatic too...I felt this was energizing and I noticed it.MUSCLES WORKED: the moves picked in just the cardio portion (aside from the strength session) were well thought out including many standing ab moves via twists etc so that you work out upper, lower, body and good core while burning mega calories in cardio...well thought out for utmost caloric burn.SET: the set is, or is made to look like, it's back stage of a theater.INSTRUCTOR TEAM: there is a back up team of all shapes and sizes which is nice.TRAINING STYLE: Amy Dixon has a good combo for a trainer...she's tough but warm rather than tough but annoying. She pushes you hard yet you LIKE her and she truly seems to enjoy what she's doing.CONCLUSION: this is one I frequently recommend.NEGATIVES: Some might not like the background shouts of ""yeah!"" ""wow!"" etc. I usually hate these in some videos I have because they seem so dang fake and rehearsed but just for me I didn't feel that way in this one...not sure why...maybe because they seemed genuine and weren't so frequent as to bug me and were done after you were pushed hard and kinda felt the same thing. Still, if you want low key know that they are there because you might not like that.ALTERNATIVES: Similar to Amy Dixon's other workouts if you like those or, if you haven't tried them and like this one you should like them, you might also like Jillian Michaels Lose Fat Boost Metabolism dvd as well if you like this one. It's another strong calorie burner (actually it burned a bit more) and really covers all muscles too but she isn't as condescending in this new dvd as she was in some others she did where she also had odd nervous laughter. She finally seems comfortable and offers great energy and motivation in that one. Weight Loss Cardio Sculpt with Violet Zaki was another recent one I found that has similar attributes, good burn and good instruction too.",5,Great cueing and measured high for calorie burn,1257033600,"11 1, 2009",2009,4129,"['CALORIC', 'BURN', 'First', ""'ll"", 'touch', 'caloric', 'burn', 'dvd', 'biggest', 'need', 'have', 'fitness', 'dvd', 'workout', 'daily', 'large', 'library', 'exercise', 'dvds', ""'ve"", 'collected', 'years', 'order', 'keep', 'interesting', 'new', 'varied', 'trainers', 'sets', 'music', 'routines', 'challenge', 'different', 'muscles', 'measure', 'caloric', 'burn', 'dvd', 'wearing', 'bodybugg', 'not', 'only', 'how', 'many', 'calories', 'burn', 'day', 'also', 'workout', 'including', 'how', 'many', 'calories', 'are', 'burned', 'minute', 'workout', 'mention', 'only', 'so', 'know', 'what', 'say', 'based', 'scientific', 'measurement', 'rather', 'perceived', 'exertion', 'calorie', 'burn', 'was', 'very', 'high', 'dvd', 'one', 'higher', 'measures', 'caloric', 'burn', 'minute', 'collection.But', 'better', 'yet', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'wiped', 'out', 'doing', 'was', 'energizing', 'many', 'moves', 'were', 'unique.ROUTINES', 'INCLUDED', 'dvd', '3', 'different', 'workouts', 'high', 'energy', 'cardio', 'fun', 'sports-based', 'moves', 'dont', 'let', 'scare', 'off', 'was', 'picked', 'last', 'p.e', 'teams', 'entire', 'childhood', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'sport', 'aside', 'skiing', 'watersports', 'iceskating', 'save', 'life', 'made', 'move', 'three', 'steps', 'lunge', 'foreward', 'raquetless', 'hand', 'swiping', 'ball', 'honesty', 'was', 'similar', 'kickboxing', 'move', 'same', 'upper', 'lower', 'body', 'cardio', 'results', 'was', 'fun', 'new', 'learn', 'routine', 'Also', 'warm', 'up', 'do', 'tai', 'chi', 'move', 'called', 'moving', 'water', 'just', 'new', 'things', ""'d"", 'never', 'done', 'before', 'spite', 'being', 'primary', 'method', 'fitness', 'backstroke', 'swimming', 'are', 'example', 'like', 'Fu', 'good', 'results', 'Also', 'strength', 'training', 'balance', 'session', 'then', 'next', 'segment', 'strictly', 'core', 'abs.CUEING', 'pro', 'cueing', 'reaaaaally', 'know', 'just', 'what', 'coming', 'up', 'get', 'steps', 'down', 'feet', 'hand', 'movements', 'are', 'added', 'aerobics.MUSIC', 'music', 'best', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'as', 'far', 'being', 'sync', 'routine', 'beat', 'movement', 'then', 'when', 'instructor', 'going', 'faster', 'more', 'rigorous', 'part', 'routine', 'music', 'more', 'dramatic', 'too', 'felt', 'was', 'energizing', 'noticed', 'it.MUSCLES', 'WORKED', 'moves', 'picked', 'just', 'cardio', 'portion', 'aside', 'strength', 'session', 'were', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'including', 'many', 'standing', 'ab', 'moves', 'twists', 'etc', 'so', 'work', 'out', 'upper', 'lower', 'body', 'good', 'core', 'burning', 'mega', 'calories', 'cardio', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'utmost', 'caloric', 'burn.SET', 'set', 'made', 'look', 'back', 'stage', 'theater.INSTRUCTOR', 'TEAM', 'back', 'up', 'team', 'shapes', 'sizes', 'nice.TRAINING', 'STYLE', 'Amy', 'Dixon', 'good', 'combo', 'trainer', 'tough', 'rather', 'tough', 'annoying', 'hard', 'yet', 'LIKE', 'truly', 'enjoy', 'what', 'doing.CONCLUSION', 'one', 'frequently', 'recommend.NEGATIVES', 'might', 'not', 'background', 'yeah', 'wow', 'etc', 'usually', 'hate', 'videos', 'have', 'seem', 'so', 'dang', 'fake', 'rehearsed', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'way', 'one', 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'maybe', 'seemed', 'genuine', 'were', ""n't"", 'so', 'frequent', 'bug', 'were', 'done', 'were', 'pushed', 'hard', 'kinda', 'felt', 'same', 'thing', 'Still', 'want', 'low', 'key', 'know', 'are', 'there', 'might', 'not', 'like', 'that.ALTERNATIVES', 'Similar', 'Amy', 'Dixon', 'other', 'workouts', 'like', 'have', ""n't"", 'tried', 'one', 'should', 'like', 'might', 'also', 'like', 'Jillian', 'Michaels', 'Lose', 'Fat', 'Boost', 'Metabolism', 'dvd', 'as', 'well', 'like', 'one', 'strong', 'calorie', 'burner', 'actually', 'burned', 'bit', 'more', 'really', 'muscles', 'too', ""n't"", 'condescending', 'new', 'dvd', 'was', 'others', 'did', 'where', 'also', 'had', 'odd', 'nervous', 'laughter', 'finally', 'comfortable', 'great', 'energy', 'motivation', 'one', 'Weight', 'Loss', 'Cardio', 'Sculpt', 'Violet', 'Zaki', 'was', 'recent', 'one', 'found', 'similar', 'attributes', 'good', 'burn', 'good', 'instruction', 'too']",N/A

The ONLY reason I docked it one star is because I would have preferred to see both the cardio and strength training section to have been at least 30 minutes long each, rather than the roughly 20 minutes as presented here.  Amy is one of the most motivating instructors out there, with spot on cueing and lots of enthusiasm as well as a lot of creative, new moves.  IN the first half of the cardio section she takes moves from three sports and translates them to a cardio workout.  She does an amazing job of mimicking swimming movements to a standing posture; well done!  The second part of the cardio is kickboxing.  As far as the strength training, Amy's specialty is slowly building multiple muscle moves.  And she adds a 10-minute abs segment, finally followed by a 10-minute stretch.

Five of some, more of others, but I don't think there were ever 15 of anything. And further annoyed with the idea of ""watch Beth"" if you needed modifications. That was a joke!! Maybe they should have hired me for that individual. She basically did the same, except for a few leg lifts. And often times was not even shown. IF you're going to suggest a 'modified' person to follow, then it should be for real and noticeable.Oh, almost forgot. Those ""whoa"", ""woo"" and such were very annoying. Maybe a 'beat' music, lightly, in the background would have improved the atmosphere. They really were annoying to me, on replays.

1112062,A1MLJP4UXEZHL9,B000WTVZ4Y,Nichole,"[2, 2]","This is another great video from Amy Dixon. Amy is one of the best instructors out there. Her videos are fun to do and typically pretty easy to follow. Amy is motivational and NOT irritating - a very important quality in a fitness instructor!This video is split into segements: a cardio segment and a weight segment, with optional bonuses of core work and a yoga inspired stretch.1. The weight segment: Excellent! You'll use a set of five pound weights, though I sometimes upgrade to 8 pounds for a specific move that I feel like I need more weight for, and you could probably switch to 3 pounds for more difficult moves. All of the moves incorporate more than once muscle group, so you'll keep your heart rate up after the cardio section. A lot of the moves incorporate balance as well. I love this weight segment. There were a lot of moves that I had never seen before. She keeps it varied and interesting, and tough. You'll definitely feel like you're working, but it's fun. This is one of my favorite weight routines I've ever done.2. The core segment: This is definitely a challenge, though sometimes I find it a little bit easier and other days it totally kicks my butt. Don't know why. Like the weight section, there are both classic moves and a bunch I've never done before. And she doesn't forget to include some back strengtheners, which I love. Great core segment that you'll keep going back to.3. The yoga stretch: I love this stretch segment. It's awesome! You'll need a towel to do it, so have one ready.4. The cardio segment: This is actually the first segment, but I saved it for last because it's the only section I don't like, and the reason I gave the video four stars instead of five. The exercises in the cardio section are based on different athletic activites, such as skating, swimming, etc. Some of these moves are fine, but I found most of them confusing and difficult to follow. Also, they require you to have a lot of space. I have a pretty decent sized basement that I work out in, and have a large library of workout dvds that I like to use. This is the only video where I've had to turn and try to do it diagonally, and even then I don't really have as much as room as I'd like to do these moves. For the most part this section leaves me feeling awkward, and even after doing it 2 or 3 times, I have to stop to watch a lot which means I don't get as much out of it as I'd like. Most of the time I just skip this section and combine the rest of the video with something else. It will get your heart rate up, though, and it's probably the kind of thing that a lot of people will really enjoy but just wasn't for me.Bottom line: One of my favorite work out videos, but for me a subpar cardio segment.",4,Excellent Video,1242172800,"05 13, 2009",2009,2728,"['great', 'video', 'Amy', 'Dixon', 'Amy', 'one', 'best', 'instructors', 'out', 'there', 'videos', 'are', 'fun', 'do', 'typically', 'pretty', 'easy', 'follow', 'Amy', 'motivational', 'NOT', 'irritating', 'very', 'important', 'quality', 'fitness', 'instructor', 'video', 'split', 'segements', 'cardio', 'segment', 'weight', 'segment', 'optional', 'bonuses', 'core', 'work', 'yoga', 'inspired', 'stretch.1', 'weight', 'segment', 'Excellent', ""'ll"", 'use', 'set', 'five', 'pound', 'weights', 'sometimes', 'upgrade', '8', 'pounds', 'specific', 'move', 'feel', 'need', 'more', 'weight', 'could', 'probably', 'switch', '3', 'pounds', 'more', 'difficult', 'moves', 'moves', 'incorporate', 'more', 'once', 'muscle', 'group', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'heart', 'rate', 'up', 'cardio', 'section', 'lot', 'moves', 'incorporate', 'balance', 'as', 'well', 'love', 'weight', 'segment', 'were', 'lot', 'moves', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'varied', 'interesting', 'tough', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'feel', ""'re"", 'working', 'fun', 'one', 'favorite', 'weight', 'routines', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'done.2', 'core', 'segment', 'definitely', 'challenge', 'sometimes', 'find', 'little', 'bit', 'easier', 'other', 'days', 'totally', 'butt', 'Do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'weight', 'section', 'are', 'classic', 'moves', 'bunch', ""'ve"", 'never', 'done', 'before', ""n't"", 'forget', 'include', 'back', 'strengtheners', 'love', 'Great', 'core', 'segment', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'going', 'back', 'to.3', 'yoga', 'stretch', 'love', 'stretch', 'segment', 'awesome', ""'ll"", 'need', 'towel', 'do', 'so', 'have', 'one', 'ready.4', 'cardio', 'segment', 'actually', 'first', 'segment', 'saved', 'last', 'only', 'section', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'reason', 'gave', 'video', 'four', 'stars', 'instead', 'five', 'exercises', 'cardio', 'section', 'are', 'based', 'different', 'athletic', 'activites', 'such', 'skating', 'swimming', 'etc', 'moves', 'are', 'fine', 'found', 'most', 'confusing', 'difficult', 'follow', 'Also', 'require', 'have', 'lot', 'space', 'have', 'pretty', 'decent', 'sized', 'basement', 'work', 'out', 'have', 'large', 'library', 'workout', 'dvds', 'like', 'use', 'only', 'video', 'where', ""'ve"", 'had', 'turn', 'try', 'do', 'diagonally', 'even', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'as', 'much', 'room', ""'d"", 'like', 'do', 'moves', 'most', 'part', 'section', 'feeling', 'awkward', 'even', 'doing', '2', '3', 'times', 'have', 'stop', 'watch', 'lot', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'as', 'much', ""'d"", 'like', 'Most', 'time', 'just', 'skip', 'section', 'combine', 'rest', 'video', 'something', 'else', 'will', 'get', 'heart', 'rate', 'up', 'probably', 'kind', 'thing', 'lot', 'people', 'will', 'really', 'enjoy', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'me.Bottom', 'line', 'One', 'favorite', 'work', 'out', 'videos', 'subpar', 'cardio', 'segment']",N/A

I have never been overweight so that is not a problem but keeping an over 40 body free of trouble spots and keeping flexible is my goal.  This workout is fast paced and dancey with great music and instruction.  I tried on my jeans today and they are loose around the midsection and my butt is lifted and looks great and young.  This is the best workout I have tried and I have tried many.  I just dont know where some people are coming from when they criticize this workout as I feel it is very well done in all aspects.  I think some people because they cant do the workout because they are so out of shape like to put the blame on amy and plus some people would criticize jesus christ if he were back on earth.

The cardio is great-- long enough to boost your heart rate so you can maximize the following 2 portions (strength and abs). The strength training is tough-- and you're not isolating muscle groups to work on them. Amy has you do things like stand on your toes or stay in a squat or hop so you work multiple groups of muscles at the same time. After the workout you feel like you really worked your butt off.

I've been doing the Jillian Michaels Shred everyday for a month and a half now and wanted a longer workout, but one that was still a full body one with some good core excercises. This was exactly what I was looking for.While I did opt for the modified versions when appropriate I never had to stop and I feel like this is the kind of workout that I, as an advanced beginner can really work into. Also, being a plus sized woman, it's great to get a good cardio without too much jumping around.I highly reccomend this for either an advanced beginner or intermediate person.The one thing that I was pleasantly surprised about was how much I liked her personality. One thing I definitly do not like about using DVDs is how perky and 'encouraging' the instructor can be. It just ticks me off. (Okay it makes me yell at the screen.) I usually turn off the commentary as soon as I get the routine down so I don't have to listen to them. I don't think I will have to do that with this, which means I will gain the benefit of being reminded of good form and reap the benefits of her excellent cuing.The moves in the cardio themselves can be sort of complex, but they aren't so much so that after a few times with the video anyone can't get them.",5,Great Full Body Workout,1235088000,"02 20, 2009",2009,1306,"['consider', 'advanced', 'beginner', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'workout', ""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', 'Jillian', 'Michaels', 'Shred', 'everyday', 'month', 'half', 'now', 'wanted', 'longer', 'workout', 'one', 'was', 'still', 'full', 'body', 'one', 'good', 'core', 'excercises', 'was', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'looking', 'for.While', 'did', 'opt', 'modified', 'versions', 'when', 'appropriate', 'never', 'had', 'stop', 'feel', 'kind', 'workout', 'advanced', 'beginner', 'can', 'really', 'work', 'Also', 'being', 'sized', 'woman', 'great', 'get', 'good', 'cardio', 'too', 'much', 'jumping', 'around.I', 'highly', 'reccomend', 'advanced', 'beginner', 'intermediate', 'person.The', 'one', 'thing', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'about', 'was', 'how', 'much', 'liked', 'personality', 'One', 'thing', 'definitly', 'do', 'not', 'using', 'DVDs', 'how', 'perky', ""'encouraging"", 'instructor', 'can', 'be', 'just', 'ticks', 'off', 'yell', 'screen', 'usually', 'turn', 'off', 'commentary', 'as', 'soon', 'get', 'routine', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'listen', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'will', 'have', 'do', 'will', 'gain', 'benefit', 'being', 'reminded', 'good', 'form', 'reap', 'benefits', 'excellent', 'cuing.The', 'moves', 'cardio', 'can', 'be', 'sort', 'complex', 'are', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'few', 'times', 'video', 'anyone', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get']",N/A

Amy Dixon is a good instructor, and she's not annoyingly perky but motivating instead (although she does move a bit fast).  She truly tested the extent of my coordination with her combination moves (my husband got a good chuckle watching me try to combine all the sports moves in the cardio workout).  However, she does give a solid workout overall.  The DVD contains a cardio segment, a strength segment, and a core segment, with a bonus yoga stretch that is nice.  The cardio segment didn't get my heart rate up as much as I would have liked, but that was probably because I was too busy looking like a spaz trying to combine some of the moves.  The strength and core segments are very good; however, on the strength segment, they suggest using 5 pound weights.  I tried, I really did--but I had to switch to 3 pounds for movements that made you do straight arms.  Given the fast pace, there wasn't much time to make that switch!  But she does cue quite nicely, and does let you know when something new is coming up (even if you're not sure what it is when she just tells you the name of it) so you're prepared.The fast pace was not all bad--I loved how she made you repeat a move just enough to give you a burn, and then combined that with another move.  The overall workout did go by very fast because of that, and it kept me motivated throughout. I definitely felt the afterburn with this one.The one huge thing I did notice was ALL THE SQUATS!  Having an issue with my right knee, I had to go easy on those after a while.  But Amy does instruct you on proper form, and several times reminds you to keep your weight in your heels during squats.  Those were nice reminders for me during the workout.  And they nicely point out the person behind her who is doing the modified moves, which I took advantage of at times.Like I said, you will definitely feel the afterburn on this one, and it is a workout I will definitely keep in my rotation.  I wasn't wowed by it, but felt that overall it is a solid workout worth investing in.  I also loved the fact that it has the different sections, so you can choose to do the whole video, or just do some cardio, strength, or core work separately if you are short on time.  A good buy that I would recommend to others.Edited to add:  I woke up the day after doing this, and my entire body is SORE (the good kind).
