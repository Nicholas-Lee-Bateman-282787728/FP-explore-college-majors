Having seen it 14 years ago when it appeared on TV under the title of 'I Can Make You Love Me; The Stalking of Laura Black', and being haunted by how accurate it was, I was thrilled to see it again. Richard Thomas brilliantly plays the computer engineer Richard Farley (though he looks nothing like the real Richard Farley); cunning, fiendish and genuinely chilling. For those who remember Thomas as 'John-Boy' on 'The Waltons', his performance will shatter that wholesome image. Brooke Shields is quite effective as Laura Black, the new computer engineer working at Farley's firm who fights back against his relentless harassment. The actors who play Chris (her supervisor at KEI) and Lt. Grijalva (hostage negotiator) are also effective. Having read about the true story of Farley & Black, I can say with some confidence that the movie is extremely close to the facts of the true story. Richard Farley finds out EVERY detail of Laura's life, right down to the locations of her parents & sisters, then threatens to harm them should Laura continue to ignore him. Farley is eventually fired by KEI for his continual harassment & decrease in productivity. But even THAT does not stop him - he continues his chilling pursuit of Laura by showing up in her garage, at her work, following her when she is dating another man, and, most chillingly - returns for a final time to KEI to carry out a horrifying massacre. It will end with 7 KEI employees dead, SWATs called in to stop the assault, and Farley awaiting a death sentence at San Quentin.

I was instantly drawn into the unforgettable plot.Laura, (Brook Shields), is an engineer who finds a job at a prestigious company.  She is introduced to one of her coworkers, Richard Farley, (Richard Thomas), who is immediately infatuated.  Infatuation quickly turns to obsession, and when Laura rejects his advances, the brilliant and sadistic Richard vows revenge: not only against Laura, but against all those, according to his warped perceptions, who have mistreated him.  The resulting explosive climax will stay with you long after the movie is finished.  Laura's courage resulted in more stringent laws regarding the safety of women and men everywhere.""Stalking Laura"" is a true drama that explores the borderline between love and obsession.  Brook Shields is totally convincing as the terrorized Laura, and Richard Thomas superbly shows his versatility as an actor by portraying Richard Farley so well.  Thomas is chilling in his performance.  His gentle, soothing tennor voice provides suaveness for a despicable psychopathic personality, and his brief flashes of rage put the viewer in mind of a coiled snake ready to strike.Please give this outstanding film a chance.
