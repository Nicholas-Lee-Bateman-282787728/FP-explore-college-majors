It appears as though the movie was filmed partially in Egypt or Israel and doesn't give a very convincing appearance of Iraq. Most of the actors are Americans or stock Arabic-speaking actors from the time and not necessarily Iraqis. However, in spite of these drawbacks which give the film a bit of a cheesy flavor, it is an engaging version of a true story. It's definitely an interesting 1980s-era romantic war movie. The setting is the mid 1960s just before the Six Day War and before Iraq was under the control of Saddam Hussein.",3,Cheesy but watchable,1238803200,"04 4, 2009",2009,676,"['First', 'all', '1980s-vintage', 'film', 'Iraqi', 'story', 'incredibly', 'dated', 'experiences', ""'ve"", 'had', 'Iraq', 'then', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'partially', 'Egypt', 'Israel', ""n't"", 'give', 'very', 'convincing', 'appearance', 'Iraq', 'Most', 'actors', 'are', 'Americans', 'stock', 'Arabic-speaking', 'actors', 'time', 'not', 'necessarily', 'Iraqis', 'However', 'spite', 'drawbacks', 'give', 'film', 'bit', 'cheesy', 'flavor', 'engaging', 'version', 'true', 'story', 'definitely', 'interesting', '1980s-era', 'romantic', 'war', 'movie', 'setting', 'mid', '1960s', 'just', 'Six', 'Day', 'War', 'Iraq', 'was', 'control', 'Saddam', 'Hussein']",Steal the Sky VHS

Reynolds,"[5, 8]","One probably would expect Yanni to emphasize the romantic aspect of a movie more than the action and suspense elements, but that's not the case here at all.  Much is said in the music.  Much of it has an ominous counterpoint to it which helps keep a viewer entranced.Especially good here is the &quot;Stealing the Jet&quot; sequence.  However, the entire soundtrack is good listening.  The bonus track, the Beatles' &quot;Nowhere Man&quot; played by an Arabic ensemble during a Baghdad party scene does hit an odd note.  But this is good movie scoring.",5,Exciting sound track music with the Yanni touch.,1030492800,"08 28, 2002",2002,552,"['One', 'probably', 'would', 'expect', 'Yanni', 'emphasize', 'romantic', 'aspect', 'movie', 'more', 'action', 'suspense', 'elements', 'not', 'case', 'here', 'Much', 'said', 'music', 'Much', 'ominous', 'counterpoint', 'keep', 'viewer', 'entranced.Especially', 'good', 'here', 'quot', 'Stealing', 'Jet', 'quot', 'sequence', 'However', 'entire', 'soundtrack', 'good', 'listening', 'bonus', 'track', 'Beatles', 'quot', 'Nowhere', 'Man', 'quot', 'played', 'Arabic', 'ensemble', 'Baghdad', 'party', 'scene', 'hit', 'odd', 'note', 'good', 'movie', 'scoring']",Steal the Sky VHS

He plays Munir Redfa, an Iraqui pilot who was seduced by an American spy played by Mariel Hemingway, and then had no choice but to steal a mig fighter jet for the Israelis...I hated the music, but Cross's performance alone is what saved the movie.  He knows when to execute and when the hell to hold back, and that is probably why he can make any movie he is in look good! He has the Middle Eastern accent down to a T, and every time he plays a part, he plays it with as much intensity as the late Henry Fonda would have. If you watch the anger scenes and his expressions as he executes, you'll know what I am referring to here.The story line itself is fast paced, and Hemingway's performance doesn't go so well until the scenes where she is helping Munir's wife and two kids escape from the Iraqui army.  This movie is a great find for History buffs out there, and I'm glad I found it.  I don't see why the work of Ben Cross hasn't gained much recognition over the past 20 years, but it should have.  He is truly one of the greatest actors to ever hit the big and small screens.",5,Great movie...,1255996800,"10 20, 2009",2009,1159,"['bought', 'simply', 'fact', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'Ben', 'Cross', 'Munir', 'Redfa', 'Iraqui', 'pilot', 'who', 'was', 'seduced', 'American', 'spy', 'played', 'Mariel', 'Hemingway', 'then', 'had', 'choice', 'steal', 'mig', 'fighter', 'jet', 'Israelis', 'hated', 'music', 'Cross', 'performance', 'alone', 'what', 'saved', 'movie', 'when', 'execute', 'when', 'hell', 'hold', 'back', 'probably', 'why', 'can', 'make', 'movie', 'look', 'good', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'accent', 'down', 'T', 'time', 'part', 'as', 'much', 'intensity', 'late', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'would', 'have', 'watch', 'anger', 'scenes', 'expressions', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', 'am', 'referring', 'here.The', 'story', 'line', 'fast', 'paced', 'Hemingway', 'performance', ""n't"", 'go', 'so', 'well', 'scenes', 'where', 'helping', 'Munir', 'wife', 'two', 'kids', 'escape', 'Iraqui', 'army', 'movie', 'great', 'find', 'History', 'buffs', 'there', ""'m"", 'glad', 'found', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'work', 'Ben', 'Cross', ""n't"", 'gained', 'much', 'recognition', 'past', '20', 'years', 'should', 'have', 'truly', 'one', 'greatest', 'actors', 'ever', 'hit', 'big', 'small', 'screens']",Steal the Sky VHS
