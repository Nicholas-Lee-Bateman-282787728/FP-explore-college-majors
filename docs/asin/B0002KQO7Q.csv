838839,A27W5AJNP6YX7Z,B0002KQO7Q,"Ivy Bewley ""Hiedra""","[0, 0]","I love tattoos. I'm someone who considers them artwork; however, there is some subject matter that I am uncertain why people would want them on their skin as permanent artwork! I was excited to see a movie about tattoos being the subject of ""opposites attract"" rather than that other tattoo movie where the person wakes up and finds they've been covered by their obsessed lover or something. (I haven't seen that one yet because it's out of print. But speaking of which, I've noticed other reviewers making comments about tattooists being portrayed as evil and that is probably the case there!)This movie was really sweet. I liked it even though I generally dislike romances (they tend to be predictable and gooey). Even though the back of the box told us that the ""uptight schoolteacher"" and the ""hulking tattooed biker"" were going to fall for each other, it seemed kind of abrupt when Sara, the teacher, went seeking out Virgil, the biker, so soon after being apparently horrified at meeting him. I guess it was because they had to fit everything into an hour and a half, but after that, everything moved at a really nice pace. I could easily see how Sara could fall for Virgil. Her mean sister said he was the exact type of guy you wouldn't bring home to Mom and even Virgil thought she was out of his league. But I could totally go for a guy like him too (minus the smoking thing).The only bad thing I have to say is the frequent swearing. Every character used the f-word continuously... even the ""uptight"" Sara. Besides me personally not enjoying obscene movies, that doesn't make sense. But overall it was a really good movie and one I would definitely recommend.",4,A romance I actually enjoyed,1337299200,"05 18, 2012",2012,1669,"['love', 'tattoos', ""'m"", 'someone', 'who', 'artwork', 'however', 'subject', 'matter', 'am', 'uncertain', 'why', 'people', 'would', 'want', 'skin', 'permanent', 'artwork', 'was', 'excited', 'see', 'movie', 'tattoos', 'being', 'subject', 'opposites', 'attract', 'rather', 'other', 'tattoo', 'movie', 'where', 'person', 'up', ""'ve"", 'been', 'covered', 'obsessed', 'lover', 'something', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'one', 'yet', 'print', 'speaking', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'other', 'reviewers', 'making', 'comments', 'tattooists', 'being', 'portrayed', 'evil', 'probably', 'case', 'there', 'movie', 'was', 'really', 'sweet', 'liked', 'even', 'generally', 'dislike', 'romances', 'tend', 'be', 'predictable', 'gooey', 'Even', 'back', 'box', 'told', 'uptight', 'schoolteacher', 'hulking', 'tattooed', 'biker', 'were', 'going', 'fall', 'other', 'seemed', 'kind', 'abrupt', 'when', 'Sara', 'teacher', 'went', 'seeking', 'out', 'Virgil', 'biker', 'so', 'soon', 'being', 'apparently', 'horrified', 'meeting', 'guess', 'was', 'had', 'fit', 'everything', 'hour', 'half', 'everything', 'moved', 'really', 'nice', 'pace', 'could', 'easily', 'see', 'how', 'Sara', 'could', 'fall', 'Virgil', 'mean', 'sister', 'said', 'was', 'exact', 'type', 'guy', 'would', ""n't"", 'bring', 'home', 'Mom', 'even', 'Virgil', 'thought', 'was', 'league', 'could', 'totally', 'go', 'guy', 'too', 'smoking', 'thing', 'only', 'bad', 'thing', 'have', 'say', 'frequent', 'swearing', 'Every', 'character', 'used', 'f-word', 'continuously', 'even', 'uptight', 'Sara', 'personally', 'not', 'enjoying', 'obscene', 'movies', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'overall', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'one', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend']","Tattoo, a Love Story"

Megan Edwards is charming as Sara, the buttoned-down grade school teacher, as she reveals her insecurities and vulnerabilities.  Virgil Mignanelli is compelling as the biker and tattoo artist that unravels Sara's tightly wrapped view of the world.  Both maintained their sensibilities, while yielding to the other in the most unexpected ways.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.",5,"Witty, clever and revealing",1098316800,"10 21, 2004",2004,516,"['Good', 'independent', 'spirit', 'movie', 'caught', 'surprise', 'affecting', 'love', 'story', 'wonderful', 'character', 'roles', 'spark', 'movie', 'Megan', 'Edwards', 'charming', 'Sara', 'buttoned-down', 'grade', 'school', 'teacher', 'insecurities', 'vulnerabilities', 'Virgil', 'Mignanelli', 'compelling', 'biker', 'tattoo', 'artist', 'unravels', 'Sara', 'tightly', 'wrapped', 'view', 'world', 'maintained', 'sensibilities', 'yielding', 'other', 'most', 'unexpected', 'ways', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'movie']","Tattoo, a Love Story"
838841,A3U3BEZMH3F01Q,B0002KQO7Q,maskirovka,"[1, 1]","This is an endearing and thought provoking movie about Sarah, a straitlaced teacher in Idaho who finds herself falling for Virgil, a heavily tattooed hulking tattoo artist with a heart of gold.While the movie centers around Sarah's character and her development, I think what sells it in the end is the actor who plays Virgil.  He's a big, obese guy with dozens of tattoos and sort of a person who you might find yourself feeling a bit nervous about if you encountered him on a dark street at night.  But appearances are deceiving, because he's got an artist's soul and a gentle manner that makes plausible the idea that a beautiful young woman might fall in love with him.Another good point to the film is that while several characters are out of central casting of cliches (Sarah's domineering older sister and Virgil's biker-stoner friends), Virgil's antagonist, Sarah's fiance, is not depicted as a jerk or loser.Still another plot device of note is borrowed from ""When Harry Met Sally"" in that the movie is interspersed with what we can assume are real people who talk to the camera about how and why they got tattoos.&lt;spoilers>One mistake in the plot I think was to have Virgil drop by Sarah's house after they had slept together and get greeted at the door by Sarah's half-naked fiance (after when Sarah and the fiance reconcile briefly).  I suppose that's something that can and does happen in real life but it made me like Sarah a little less and keep in mind the admonition that getting involved with someone who is going through a break up in a long term relationship is a great way to get hurt.But I give the movie points for not having Sarah run into Virgil's arms at the end.  She instead goes off on a road trip to ""find herself."" And Virgil doesn't say, ""I'll wait for you babe,"" but indicates whether they reunite will depend on what their future selves decide.But the movie implies a happy ending because Sarah is fitted into the ""real people"" framework I mention above (because she got a tattoo from Virgil before going off on her road trip).  In that brief conversation with the unseen interviewer she mentions she ""fell in love with a biker.""  So I for one am concluding she and Virgil are a couple in the fictional world created by this film.",4,Nice Little Movie with Engaging Premise,1322006400,"11 23, 2011",2011,2267,"['endearing', 'thought', 'provoking', 'movie', 'Sarah', 'straitlaced', 'teacher', 'Idaho', 'who', 'falling', 'Virgil', 'heavily', 'tattooed', 'hulking', 'tattoo', 'artist', 'heart', 'gold.While', 'movie', 'centers', 'Sarah', 'character', 'development', 'think', 'what', 'end', 'actor', 'who', 'Virgil', 'big', 'obese', 'guy', 'dozens', 'tattoos', 'sort', 'person', 'who', 'might', 'find', 'feeling', 'bit', 'nervous', 'encountered', 'dark', 'street', 'night', 'appearances', 'are', 'deceiving', 'got', 'artist', 'soul', 'gentle', 'manner', 'plausible', 'idea', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'might', 'fall', 'love', 'him.Another', 'good', 'point', 'film', 'several', 'characters', 'are', 'central', 'casting', 'cliches', 'Sarah', 'domineering', 'older', 'sister', 'Virgil', 'biker-stoner', 'friends', 'Virgil', 'antagonist', 'Sarah', 'fiance', 'not', 'depicted', 'jerk', 'loser.Still', 'plot', 'device', 'note', 'borrowed', 'When', 'Harry', 'Met', 'Sally', 'movie', 'interspersed', 'what', 'can', 'assume', 'are', 'real', 'people', 'who', 'talk', 'camera', 'how', 'why', 'got', 'tattoos.', 'lt', 'spoilers', '>', 'One', 'mistake', 'plot', 'think', 'was', 'have', 'Virgil', 'drop', 'Sarah', 'house', 'had', 'slept', 'together', 'get', 'greeted', 'door', 'Sarah', 'half-naked', 'fiance', 'when', 'Sarah', 'fiance', 'reconcile', 'briefly', 'suppose', 'something', 'can', 'happen', 'real', 'life', 'made', 'Sarah', 'little', 'less', 'keep', 'mind', 'admonition', 'getting', 'involved', 'someone', 'who', 'going', 'break', 'up', 'long', 'term', 'relationship', 'great', 'way', 'get', 'hurt.But', 'give', 'movie', 'points', 'not', 'having', 'Sarah', 'run', 'Virgil', 'arms', 'end', 'instead', 'off', 'road', 'trip', 'find', 'Virgil', ""n't"", 'say', ""'ll"", 'wait', 'babe', 'reunite', 'will', 'depend', 'what', 'future', 'decide.But', 'movie', 'happy', 'ending', 'Sarah', 'fitted', 'real', 'people', 'framework', 'mention', 'got', 'tattoo', 'Virgil', 'going', 'off', 'road', 'trip', 'brief', 'conversation', 'unseen', 'interviewer', 'fell', 'love', 'biker', 'one', 'am', 'concluding', 'Virgil', 'are', 'couple', 'fictional', 'world', 'created', 'film']","Tattoo, a Love Story"

She dreams of a successful career, a long awaited wedding to her docter boyfriend, and a safe, tame suburbanite existence.But there's some flaws in the plan, Sarah secretly hates teaching, and oh yeah her boyfriend's about to leave her. Which combined with an unexpected show and tell visitor are the catalyst for the change that sarah desperately needs.Motorcycle riding, tattoo covered Virgil(Virgil Mignanelli) is that unexpected show and tell visitor. He's a tattoo artist frustrated by clients who are only interested in popularized kitsch. Virg is a big guy with big insecurities, he spends his nights reading and watching the same old black and white movies. In other words Virgil needs a little life in his life.touching, funny, and entertaining things happen when these two opposites enter each others lives.
