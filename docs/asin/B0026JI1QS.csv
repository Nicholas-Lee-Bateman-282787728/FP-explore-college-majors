In this case the twist is not only ""is he"" but also ""are they?"" A Dutch idealist is kidnapped by a group of terrorists who torture him to obtain information he claims he doesn't have. Is he a do gooder in Morocco to help with a food program, or a terrorist intent on a worldwide scheme to poison people? But while we ponder that question, are his interrogators really terrorists or are they CIA counter agents trying to determine whether or not the Dutchman is a terrorist and obtaining information about his terrorist cell?The Dutch idealist is played by Ryan Phillippe (1974). He's best remembered as TV's first gay teen in ""One Life to Live"". Subsequently he's been in films like ""Antitrust"" (2001), ""Crash"" (2004), and ""Flags of our Fathers"". Phillippe does a good job but he has problems maintaining his accent.The chief interrogator is Laurence Fishburne (1961). Fishburne may be best known as Dr. Ray Langston from the hit series ""CSI"", but it was his great performance as Ike Turner in ""What's Love Got to do with it?"" (1994) that propelled him to stardom, and an Academy Award nomination, and his role as Morpheus in the ""Matrix"" trilogy that brought him wide scale attention. Fact is, Fishburne has given us many excellent performances, from his early years (Mr. Clean in ""Apocalypse Now"", Bumpy Rhodes in ""Cotton Club""). He does his usual intense job here, and his accent is great.Fishburne is assisted by real life spouse Gina Torres (1969). You'll recognize her as the boss from ""Suits"" (2011) and for her role as the deadly Anna from ""Alias"" (2001-6) and as Zoe in ""Firefly"" (2002-3). She also does a great job.Colm Meany and Said Taghmaoui put in good performances in supporting roles.Most of the film takes place in a warehouse where Phillippe is tortured by having a finger cut off each time he lies or refuses to provide information he is expected to have. It's a tribute to director (and co-writer) Laurence Malkin that the film never drags or feels claustrophobic or stagey. This was the second time as a director for Malkin and his fourth screenplay.Definitely not for the squeamish.",3,Intense mystery,1310774400,"07 16, 2011",2011,2185,"['Five', 'fingers', 'intense', 'mystery', 'variation', ""n't"", 'variety', 'case', 'twist', 'not', 'only', 'also', 'are', 'Dutch', 'idealist', 'kidnapped', 'group', 'terrorists', 'who', 'torture', 'obtain', 'information', ""n't"", 'have', 'do', 'gooder', 'Morocco', 'help', 'food', 'program', 'terrorist', 'intent', 'worldwide', 'scheme', 'poison', 'people', 'ponder', 'question', 'are', 'interrogators', 'really', 'terrorists', 'are', 'CIA', 'counter', 'agents', 'trying', 'determine', 'not', 'Dutchman', 'terrorist', 'obtaining', 'information', 'terrorist', 'cell', 'Dutch', 'idealist', 'played', 'Ryan', 'Phillippe', '1974', 'best', 'remembered', 'TV', 'first', 'gay', 'teen', 'One', 'Life', 'Live', 'Subsequently', 'been', 'films', 'Antitrust', '2001', 'Crash', '2004', 'Flags', 'Fathers', 'Phillippe', 'good', 'job', 'problems', 'maintaining', 'accent.The', 'chief', 'interrogator', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', '1961', 'Fishburne', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'known', 'Dr.', 'Ray', 'Langston', 'hit', 'series', 'CSI', 'was', 'great', 'performance', 'Ike', 'Turner', 'What', 'Love', 'Got', 'do', '1994', 'propelled', 'stardom', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'role', 'Morpheus', 'Matrix', 'trilogy', 'brought', 'wide', 'scale', 'attention', 'Fact', 'Fishburne', 'given', 'many', 'excellent', 'performances', 'early', 'years', 'Mr.', 'Clean', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'Bumpy', 'Rhodes', 'Cotton', 'Club', 'usual', 'intense', 'job', 'here', 'accent', 'great.Fishburne', 'assisted', 'real', 'life', 'spouse', 'Gina', 'Torres', '1969', ""'ll"", 'recognize', 'boss', 'Suits', '2011', 'role', 'deadly', 'Anna', 'Alias', '2001-6', 'Zoe', 'Firefly', '2002-3', 'also', 'great', 'job.Colm', 'Meany', 'Said', 'Taghmaoui', 'put', 'good', 'performances', 'supporting', 'roles.Most', 'film', 'place', 'warehouse', 'where', 'Phillippe', 'tortured', 'having', 'finger', 'cut', 'off', 'time', 'provide', 'information', 'expected', 'have', 'tribute', 'director', 'co-writer', 'Laurence', 'Malkin', 'film', 'never', 'feels', 'claustrophobic', 'stagey', 'was', 'second', 'time', 'director', 'Malkin', 'fourth', 'screenplay.Definitely', 'not', 'squeamish']",Five Fingers

Within moments of his arrival Martijn and his friend are abducted on a bus by a group of terrorists, only one of them is injected with a drug, but both are imprisoned.  Do you see the mystery forming already? Under threat of death, Martinj engages in a mental chess match with AHMAT (Laurence Fishburne), trying to learn his captor's true objective and avoid death.  When he fails to answer the questions that his captors are asking, they begin to cut off his fingers.  Since he plays piano this is very significant.  The captors seem to know all about him.  How do they know so much?  Is it the beautiful mysterious girlfriend that he left at home?  To add to the thrill and mystery of the movie Gina Torres (Fishburne's wife in real life) enters and gives an award winning performance.  First she appears to sympathize with Martijn, but then she flips and is working with Ahmat.  After intense interrogation, Martijn decides to give in and writes down some information on a piece of paper.  I am still in the dark because the movie ended with me not knowing if he really knew nothing or did he really know something?  I enjoyed the movie.  The characters were very convincing and memorable.  There are several unpredictable things that happen at the end.  But the one thing that did not happen was to reveal to me why he was abducted and if he was a case of mistaken identity.  I searched on the internet for a revelation to the ending and found none.

1251603,A27JAIYP0U9FGH,B0026JI1QS,PJR,"[3, 5]","The negative reviews made me skeptical. But the film turned out to have excellent acting and dialogue. It is all about mind games during a torture interrogation of a young Dutch lefty. Are the interrogators CIA trying to trick the guy into giving up his collaborators? They eventually drop the mystery stance and claim to be on the rebel side that he eventually claims to be on or admits to be on as the case might be. But they want him to convince them that he is really one of them by telling everything he knows. He either does not want to do that because he does not completely trust them, or he cannot as the case might be because maybe he really is lying and working for the CIA and cannot.There are only two probable outcomes. Either they are really CIA and he should not trust his kidnappers, or he is really CIA and does not know all the people in the cell in the Netherlands. So if all the viewers guess randomly, like flip a coin, half will be right! FYI, I guessed right.But the outcome is not so important actually to appreciation of the film as film. What is important is that the acting is very good and gripping and as details come out during the mind games and torture you want to go back and think how previous details might fit or not, and you are inspired to reinterpret some. It is a good thinking person's film. Like some of my most admired spy films.I want to watch it again even though I know the outcome. It would be like studying the moves in classic chess games, which I used to do when younger.In terms of political relevance, yeah this is probably timely in a way. There is some nasty stuff going on out there in the world on the dark side of empire building and anger at it, including torture. And the passion and commitment on the various sides can be argued. But this is not really anything new. The political statement is not the reason that this is a fine film. But the political implications are at least provocative and may be instructive for some viewers.The making-of feature on the DVD is not great, but it is better than the average making-of which tends to be insulting to one's intelligence and a waste of time unless you happen to be star-struck.Five fingers refers to the fact that his passion is playing the piano and they cut off his fingers brutally one by one to turn up the heat on him as the interrogation proceeds. But this is not gratuitous gore. It is so cruel on their part and such a sacrifice on his part that even his captors (whoever they are) come to admire his courage and passion, whether he is CIA and passionately loyal to America, or a real left-wing activist who is completely determined to bring down the ruling global order. The point is well made that there is enormous passion and motivation on both sides out there on the battle lines. I think well crafted spy films often make this sort of point, but not in such a viscerally convincing and memorable way. It is such an obvious point that it is easy to say at the level of words. But making this point in convincingly human terms is very well done in this film.

Laurence plays the captor and Phillippe plays the victim. Putting aside the rightful critiques (that one can read about extensively online) regarding the horrible accents, choppy writing and poor scene mixing, you might get some light entertainment from this. I was not a fan of anything in the film until the final three plot twists given to us in the last two minutes. I would have to say it might leave a better feeling with you once you know why the accents sucked, why they were writing the film towards a known conclusion and what the greater good is (supposedly) being protected here.The supplements are weak and do not give this a higher rating. The making-of is 11 minutes long and is entirely about how incredible everyone is to be around (my least favorite kind of supplement).

Fishburne and Phillipe as the two main characters locked in a battle of mind and will power turn in an excellent performance, as do the supporting characters. The story starts swiftly and almost from the beginning the tension is notched up, and with each twist and turn the movie continues to question who really is the good guy in all of this, if indeed there could be one.
