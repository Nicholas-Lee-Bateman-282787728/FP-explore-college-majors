972862,A39GW5CBWTIWAZ,B000EHQ84Q,Phil S.,"[0, 0]","The former lead singer of Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes, takes stage center in lake Tahoe at the approximate end of the Disco era (record-wise) and delivers some of the best Disco-Soul ever done, incorporating Blue Note and solo material.Highlights: Life is a Song...; All By Myself (a chance to show off his *voice*);When Somebody Loves You back (featuring beautiful ladies from the audience, dueting with the star); Get Up, Get Down...Audio is okay - though recorded on 24 track, it sounds second-generation monophonic; video is also just marginally good. This reviewer found nothing seriously wrong with the quality.A very important detail for me is the camera work and editing. Long before the hyperactive camera of today and the exclusion of the crowd in the cinematograhy, this production features the enthralled attendees, giving it that ""party"" atmosphere - guess in 2011 we've gotten too sophisticated.Minor observation: TP opens the show in one of the strangest outfits I've ever encountered as a viewer, something of a wrap-around white cape, possibly something Little Richard dropped off at the GoodWill center in 1972; apparently a Dodge Dart tarpelin, fashioned into flambouyant stage attire. Later, he relinquishes the garb, and we see a well-fitted, long sleeve white shirt and loose fitting white pants. Looks pretty cool. But...the shirt is remove3d and the dude is wearinga white A-shirt from Sears. Well, it was the '70s...it was Vegas. Perhaps the bad taste but hip thing had not worn off since Elvis at the Hilton.Overall, I would place this video right up there with JAMES BROWN AND HIS VERY SPECIAL GUEST, B. B. KING, another show which captures an event in its' entirety, including crowd shots, and an exceptionally strong back-up. As vintage solo act Soul shows go, there are very, very few representative offers out there. If there are, please let me know, in ""Comments"".Important feature: a great one on one interview at Teddy's Philadelphia home, around 2002.

Teddy delivered both suave and gritty Soul in an era when disco and radio formats started to reign. His performances were at the same time highly erotic and uninhibited macho. With his mighty and gruff pipes he blew away the competition but could be very tender as well. Teddy is best known for his silky albums but was a mean live performer to boot. So naturally any live DVD should be welcomed. But as with many DVD releases of classic Soul artists this release just doesn't suffice. Although I wouldn't want to argue about the quality of the material that is there, which is exhilarating, it just isn't enough. This release features only eight songs and very little interesting bonus material. I guess we'll have to do with this very meager release.
