The initial buildup of creepiness, however, was quickly marred by the highly improbable (first death, I won't spoil but sorry, it was physically *impossible*), the stupid (the first implication of homicidal insanity is apparently due to wearing an old hat; later such happenings aren't explained at all), and the incredibly annoying (the loud music and screeching that pops in at random intervals and is so loud that you have to mute your TV and then can't hear the dialogue).  These things make it impossible to immerse yourself in the movie and pretty much override the creepiness.  I won't spoil the ending, but it's pretty much just senseless confusion.  It's too bad, because the actors aren't bad (that and the initial interesting premise is why I give it any stars at all), but what could have been a really interesting, psychologically intense and creepy indie film unfortunately ends up being an annoying, confusing mess that ends with a whimper instead of a bang.",2,Goodbye Yellowbrickroad,1364342400,"03 27, 2013",2013,1211,"['actually', 'had', 'really', 'high', 'hopes', 'movie', 'started', 'off', 'looking', 'lot', 'more', 'original', 'typical', 'group', 'young', 'people', 'tracking', 'down', 'creepy', 'legend', 'scoffs', 'danger', 'head', 'off', 'wilderness', 'horror', 'movie', 'initial', 'buildup', 'creepiness', 'however', 'was', 'quickly', 'marred', 'highly', 'improbable', 'first', 'death', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'sorry', 'was', 'physically', '*impossible*', 'stupid', 'first', 'implication', 'homicidal', 'insanity', 'apparently', 'due', 'wearing', 'old', 'hat', 'later', 'such', 'happenings', 'are', ""n't"", 'explained', 'incredibly', 'annoying', 'loud', 'music', 'screeching', 'random', 'intervals', 'so', 'loud', 'have', 'mute', 'TV', 'then', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hear', 'dialogue', 'things', 'make', 'impossible', 'immerse', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'creepiness', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'ending', 'pretty', 'much', 'just', 'senseless', 'confusion', 'too', 'bad', 'actors', 'are', ""n't"", 'bad', 'initial', 'interesting', 'premise', 'why', 'give', 'stars', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'interesting', 'psychologically', 'intense', 'creepy', 'indie', 'film', 'unfortunately', 'up', 'being', 'annoying', 'confusing', 'mess', 'whimper', 'instead', 'bang']",Yellow Brick Road

It didn't really explain anything (as it could be interpreted a half-dozen different ways including a few obvious metaphors) and, truthfully, I didn't care what the explanation would be because I had already given up on the writing by then.So if you've already made the mistake of paying for this movie and compounded it by spending your time watching it, I can say with some confidence that you can pretty much walk away from it at any time without missing anything.

1430259,A3GKMQFL05Z79K,B004W48KHK,blackaciddevil,"[2, 3]","One Morning in New England, in 1940, the entire population of Friar, New Hampshire walked together up a winding mountain trail & into the wilderness. They left behind their clothes, their money, all of their essentials. A US Army Search Party was dispatched there where they eventually discovered the remains of nearly 300 of Friar's evacuees(out of total of 572 people). Many were slaughtered. Many froze to death. All cruelly and mysteriously. No one knows why. The bodies of the remaining are still unaccounted for. Thier fate went for over 70 years unaccounted for. A team of researchers discover the trailhead and attempt to track the path the doomed citizens of Friar took to find out what happend to them. This is the tale of the YellowBrickRoad.I happend to come across this movie while shopping. What drew me to it, honestly, was the fact that I recognized Cassidy Freeman(whom you all know as Tess from Smallville). Not only that but the asking price for it was pretty reasonable, too. So, I purchase the movie and bring it home. After viewing it, I was left speechless. I couldn't believe this was a Bloody Disgusting Selects movie and it was this good. I've bought a few Bloody Disgusting Selects movies that I was disaapointed with and I figured this one would leave me disappointed as well(Course, on a sidenote, they released Exit Humanity here recently and it was pretty good).The thing I love most about the movie is how it tends to get under your skin, so to speak. It's creepy and will stay with you long after the movie is over. My biggest gripe with the movie, however, is how it ends. It didn't really give me a sense of closure to the movie. Very little was explained as to why things happend the way they did and I found that disappointing as well as annoying. How many movies have you ever watched that just leaves you hanging at the end wondering ""WTF?""Despite my feelings towards the ending, though, I still recommend YellowBrickRoad to everyone.

1430261,AODKUG6FAKD2Z,B004W48KHK,"Bryan Byrd ""reviewer of bad films and good books""","[12, 14]","Disclaimer: I viewed this film as a streaming rental and cannot comment on the audio or visual appearance of the disc.  My review concerns the entertainment value of the film only.According to the backstory of YELLOW BRICK ROAD, in 1940 the residents of an entire New England town decided one day to abandon their village - they walked up a wooded trail and most were never seen again, although a great portion of them were found slaughtered along the trail.  Now, seventy years later, a small group of researchers are attempting to discover what happened and why the townsfolk left.  They won't like what they find.The thumbnail image for this DVD is misleading - it reminds me ofThe Hills Have EyesorWrong Turn- and suggests a supernatural slasher type film.  There is no doubt there are some disturbing visuals here (or at least I found them to be) but that aspect of the film acts as an effective contribution to the atmosphere of creepy dread rather than as the primary focus.  Thus those looking for splatter and gore may be disappointed.What this film does do, not quite coherently but still effectively, is create a very unsettling feeling, one just sideways enough so that I never had a handle on what was coming next.  It's a puzzling film - the character's motivations aren't always clear, and the resolution of the narrative leaves even more questions - but I have the feeling that none of that really matters.  Instead, with its mixture of gruesome images, suggestiveness, and unpredictability, I thought it a rare horror film that actually accomplished being horrifying rather than terrifying.Still, its difficult to know to whom to recommend it.  If anything, it reminds me ofThe Blair Witch Project, without the shaky hand-cam and a less linear narrative.  24 hours later, and I'm still a little creeped out by it.",4,Creepy good.,1330646400,"03 2, 2012",2012,1830,"['Disclaimer', 'viewed', 'film', 'streaming', 'rental', 'can', 'not', 'comment', 'audio', 'visual', 'appearance', 'disc', 'review', 'entertainment', 'value', 'film', 'only.According', 'backstory', 'YELLOW', 'BRICK', 'ROAD', '1940', 'residents', 'entire', 'New', 'England', 'town', 'decided', 'one', 'day', 'abandon', 'village', 'walked', 'up', 'wooded', 'trail', 'most', 'were', 'never', 'seen', 'again', 'great', 'portion', 'were', 'found', 'slaughtered', 'trail', 'Now', 'seventy', 'years', 'later', 'small', 'group', 'researchers', 'are', 'attempting', 'discover', 'what', 'happened', 'why', 'townsfolk', 'left', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'what', 'find.The', 'thumbnail', 'image', 'DVD', 'misleading', 'ofThe', 'Hills', 'Have', 'EyesorWrong', 'Turn-', 'supernatural', 'slasher', 'type', 'film', 'doubt', 'are', 'disturbing', 'visuals', 'here', 'least', 'found', 'be', 'aspect', 'film', 'effective', 'contribution', 'atmosphere', 'creepy', 'dread', 'rather', 'primary', 'focus', 'Thus', 'looking', 'splatter', 'gore', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed.What', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'quite', 'coherently', 'still', 'effectively', 'create', 'very', 'unsettling', 'feeling', 'one', 'just', 'enough', 'never', 'had', 'handle', 'what', 'was', 'coming', 'next', 'puzzling', 'film', 'character', 'motivations', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'clear', 'resolution', 'narrative', 'leaves', 'even', 'more', 'questions', 'have', 'feeling', 'none', 'really', 'matters', 'Instead', 'mixture', 'gruesome', 'images', 'suggestiveness', 'unpredictability', 'thought', 'rare', 'horror', 'film', 'actually', 'accomplished', 'being', 'horrifying', 'rather', 'terrifying.Still', 'difficult', 'know', 'whom', 'recommend', 'anything', 'ofThe', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'shaky', 'hand-cam', 'less', 'linear', 'narrative', '24', 'hours', 'later', ""'m"", 'still', 'little', 'creeped', 'out']",Yellow Brick Road

1430263,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B004W48KHK,DanD,"[1, 1]","Let's face it: horror gets a bad rep.  And this reputation is entirely deserved at times.  I'm a huge fan of the genre, but I have no trouble admitting this.  It's always been the case; people will often go for the low blow because (get this) other people will completely buy into it.YELLOW BRICK ROAD (or YELLOWBRICKROAD, a title I love a lot more) is not one of these low-blow films.  In fact, it's pretty high-brow, to a fault by the time the film wraps up.  It winds up in a realm of ""let's just mess with your head because by now we know we can.""  But before the final fifteen or twenty minutes (especially the final scene)?  The film legitimately messes with your head.  It starts slow: a group of curious folk seek to discover what happened to an entire town that just up and vanished, following a fabled path into...nowhere.  Does this path even exist?  What happened to these people?  Those are the questions that need answering (though, in the words of a character during a key scene, they are questions that never needed asking).  But what our adventurers find is something completely beyond their expectations, something almost totally beyond the human experience, a waking nightmare that will lead them to the edge and shove them over the side.It's a slow-burner, for sure.  In fact, when all hell breaks loose, it's sudden and disturbing.  There are few films I've seen that come back to haunt me; I'm sure YELLOW BRICK ROAD will be popping up in my nightmares at random points during the next couple months.  There is one scene in particular that probably comes down as the most gut-wrenching death scene I've watched, not so much for the gore (there's some, but not much by most comparisons) but more so for the way it's filmed, and the psychological implications.  And therein lies the crux: this is a cerebral horror film.  That'll put off a lot of people, and truth be told, the film becomes TOO cerebral by its end, too caught up in itself.  But when it's right, it's right.  Rooted by realistic, earthy performances, and hefted by some truly disturbing cinematography, YELLOW BRICK ROAD is a horror film to watch, especially if, like me, you tend to prefer your horror films with a little brains behind them.",4,Worth the effort.,1382313600,"10 21, 2013",2013,2229,"['Let', 'face', 'horror', 'bad', 'rep.', 'reputation', 'entirely', 'deserved', 'times', ""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'genre', 'have', 'trouble', 'admitting', 'always', 'been', 'case', 'people', 'will', 'often', 'go', 'low', 'blow', 'get', 'other', 'people', 'will', 'completely', 'buy', 'it.YELLOW', 'BRICK', 'ROAD', 'YELLOWBRICKROAD', 'title', 'love', 'lot', 'more', 'not', 'one', 'low-blow', 'films', 'fact', 'pretty', 'high-brow', 'fault', 'time', 'film', 'up', 'up', 'realm', 'let', 'just', 'mess', 'head', 'now', 'know', 'can', 'final', 'fifteen', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'especially', 'final', 'scene', 'film', 'legitimately', 'head', 'slow', 'group', 'curious', 'folk', 'seek', 'discover', 'what', 'happened', 'entire', 'town', 'just', 'up', 'vanished', 'following', 'fabled', 'path', 'nowhere', 'path', 'even', 'exist', 'What', 'happened', 'people', 'are', 'questions', 'need', 'answering', 'words', 'character', 'key', 'scene', 'are', 'questions', 'never', 'needed', 'asking', 'what', 'adventurers', 'find', 'something', 'completely', 'expectations', 'something', 'almost', 'totally', 'human', 'experience', 'waking', 'nightmare', 'will', 'lead', 'edge', 'shove', 'over', 'side.It', 'slow-burner', 'sure', 'fact', 'when', 'hell', 'breaks', 'loose', 'sudden', 'disturbing', 'are', 'few', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'come', 'back', 'haunt', ""'m"", 'sure', 'YELLOW', 'BRICK', 'ROAD', 'will', 'be', 'popping', 'up', 'nightmares', 'random', 'points', 'next', 'couple', 'months', 'one', 'scene', 'particular', 'probably', 'down', 'most', 'gut-wrenching', 'death', 'scene', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'gore', 'not', 'much', 'most', 'comparisons', 'more', 'so', 'way', 'filmed', 'psychological', 'implications', 'therein', 'crux', 'cerebral', 'horror', 'film', ""'ll"", 'put', 'off', 'lot', 'people', 'truth', 'be', 'told', 'film', 'TOO', 'cerebral', 'end', 'too', 'caught', 'up', 'when', 'right', 'right', 'Rooted', 'realistic', 'earthy', 'performances', 'hefted', 'truly', 'disturbing', 'cinematography', 'YELLOW', 'BRICK', 'ROAD', 'horror', 'film', 'watch', 'especially', 'tend', 'prefer', 'horror', 'films', 'little', 'brains']",Yellow Brick Road
1430264,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B004W48KHK,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[2, 4]","Wherever a group of people foolishly enter the woods in search of a legend, I am there.  Well, not there physically, because I do not do bugs and critters - but I am there to watch it all through the voyeuristic prism of video.  YellowBrickRoad offers a particularly fascinating premise.  As the story goes, back in 1940 the entire population of Friar, New Hampshire left everything behind to travel up a nearby trail that has come to be known as the Yellow Brick Road.  Some of their bodies were discovered along the way - some frozen, some slaughtered - but a majority of the Friar townspeople were never heard from again.  The only known survivor could contribute nothing more than gibberish.  Now, almost seventy years later, an author/photographer has finally gotten his hands on the classified records and organizes a party of investigators to set out from the long-lost trailhead in an attempt to discover what really happened to those who made the walk all those years ago.  It sounds fascinating, and it is - for a while, at least.  The ultimate question, of course, is how a story like this should end.  Unfortunately, the filmmakers were never able to come up with a truly effective answer to this question - and it begins to show about midway through, as the structure of the film begins to break down.The cast is centered on the husband and wife writing team of Teddy (Michael Laurino) and Melissa Barnes (Anessa Ramsey) and their academic colleague, psychologist Walter Myrick (Alex Draper).  For this expedition into the remote woods of New Hampshire, they bring along a tracker, a brother-sister team of map-makers, an intern, and a weird chick they meet at the Friar movie theatre who shows them the trail marker they're completely unable to find on their own.  Things start off OK (although I would have thought Walter would have had sense enough not to wear shorts for a trip through the brush), but things start to get weird a couple of days in.  Their GPS goes berserk, one dude starts obsessing over a hat he found, and the team begins to hear music.  I'm not talking bird song or wind whispering through the trees - I'm talking about big band and other vintage songs being played quite loudly day and night.  It's enough to drive you crazy - and that's basically what happens to the group members one by one.Sure there's some suspense as bad things start happening to these people, but I can't say the isolated environment ever generates the level of creepiness I was expecting.  I never really developed an emotional attachment to any of the characters, either.  With better character development, maybe I would have had more of an emotional reaction to everyone's intellectual moorings coming undone as the rug of reality was slowly pulled out from underneath their feet.  There is one moment well into the film when I thought the story was about to reestablish itself with a really twisted tie to The Wizard of Oz, but that just didn't happen, requiring me to sit patiently as the movie basically unwound itself to the ending, leaving the ""why"" of the whole story behind in the process.Despite my dissatisfaction with the ending, I would still recommend YellowBrickRoad to my fellow horror enthusiasts.  First-time filmmakers Jesse Holland and Andy Mitton show great promise, as they've produced a bond fide original psychological horror film of genuine suspense that doesn't rely on gore or special effects to work itself under your skin.

The premise is very simple and as the story unfolds you realize that there is no turning back on yellow brick road. Once you're in, you're invested in following the expedition of travelers who (at first) seem energetic and curious only to later become hunted, scared and weary. They are on the search to find out what happened to the townspeople of Friar, NH, all of whom disappeared in 1940. The group of travelers follow an ancient trail that leads them into the middle of the wilderness. The farther they get, they start to realize maybe the mythology they've been so deeply invested in is not as far from reality as they initially thought. They come to find the trail is haunted by those that have gone before and are also plagued by the natural elements around them as well as each other. Tensions mount, anger erupts and death begins. The psychological aspect of this film is pulled off rather wonderfully and the imagery of this film will stick with you long after you have seen the movie.

The second indicator is an awful script that is almost entirely composed of implausible behaviors and dialogue.Storyline:Nearly the entire population of a small town walks into the woods to die or kill each other in the '40s only to be later found by government representatives and hushed up for 60+ years. The movie's expedition is comprised of an odd assortment of people such as a psychologist to record psychological effects. He uses a cheap camera to record questions such as, repeat the prime numbers (as if anyone remembers the prime rules) and say the alphabet backwards. Just juvenile pop psych.  Another person has parks experience and another has GPS experience (that must take real skill). They retrace the route only to find the GPS and compasses don't work due to some pseudo-scientific effect called Southern Hemisphere centripetal opposite magnetic force or whatever. Then they start hearing really fakey 20s, 30s, 40s mostly wrong period music coming from the woods along with really fake squelch audio effects all of which causes the members to start killing one another in really fake enactments such as one where some guy pulls the leg off of a compatriot (physically impossible by the way) because she doesn't like his hat. Another when a woman jumps off of a cliff and all we see from a very long distance, so as not to be too clear, is a very cheap CGI that looks like a stiff plastic toy doll.

It wasn't your typical slasher-type horror film - the villain seemed to be the environment itself. The ideas in YBR were awesome but the execution of these ideas weren't always up to par.Not to give much away but it was already mentioned in another review here about the guy ripping the girl's leg off (why would you want to rip off the leg of Tess Mercer from Smallville? Not very nice) - anyway, I really doubt a guy could rip off a girl's leg - even after bashing it with a rock a couple times - there'd be all those muscles and tendons and ..stuff. And the rock-bashing seemed so unenthusiastic - it was like he was using a real rock and would come down hard but then stop about a foot above her leg and gently tap it - you're going to have to bash a leg a lot harder than that if you want to soften it up enough to rip it off with your bare hands. Just saying..But, all this talk of limbs being torn off doesn't do this movie justice - it is a genuinely different and eerie movie (loved the music) and the only real violence is in regards to that one scene (okay, maybe a couple of other fairly mild scenes).

Once I started watching I was riveted to the screen from start to finish.There are no cheap scares and typical formula horror cliches here.  This is a truly bizarre and original film that is disturbing and unsettling, more because of what you can't see or don't know, rather than anything shoved right into your face.  A group of people go out into the wilderness to try to determine what made the residents of this small town leave their homes and (mostly) disappear back in 1940.  What they find is nothing in the area in which they are hiking is as it seems, and compasses and other instruments do not function properly.  Eventually they find that they are not sure where they are; they are haunted by 40's music that seems to come from nowhere and everywhere, and eventually, they start to go mad and turn on each other.  Those with enough of their faculties still remaining are torn between finding out the source of the mystery, now that they've come this far, or turning tail and getting the hell back where they came from.For reference points, try a dash of David Lynch, a bit of Blair Witch without the shakey camera work, and (if you've read it) the sensibilities of ""House Of Leaves"".

Only one person survived and he was a bit crazy. Bodies were found along the trail, many more missing.Years later Teddy Barnes, teacher and writer (Michael Laurino) manages to obtain the records and decides to investigate in order to publish a book. The team goes to the co-ordinates of the trail head only to find a movie theater. Teddy decides to go into the theater and talk to the counter girl/projectionist who tells him a bizarre tale of how the original Oz movie was playing at the time of the incident. She (Laura Heisler) is over eager to help them go down the Yellow Brick Road, a sign that marks the trial.She takes them to the trail. There is a psychologist(Alex Draper) on the trip who is constantly filming individuals and asking them questions as a sanity check. This gives the movie the annoying feel of those reality type movies. Also in the team is his wife Melissa (Anessa Ramsey) and Daryl and Erin Luger (Clark Freeman and Cassidy Freeman). Cy (Sam Elmore) and Jill (Tara Giordano) round out the team as they head on down the trail laced with belladonna. The movie develops slowly as small things happen. Daryl finds a hat that is from the era, but seems new. Jill's GPS goes haywire, one minute they are in Guam, the next Italy. They joke about it.They hike for five days in Northern NH (is that possible?)  Their instruments are not working properly and they know something is at work, but what? They speculate: Solar flares?

I understand that it's an independent film, written, directed, and starring first timers, but anyone who read this script had to have known it just wouldn't work! Don't get me wrong, the story they had was extremely solid, and they could have taken it in a million different directions, any other direction than the one they took. The story starts 70 years ago, when an entire town randomly decides to follow a path into the woods and are never heard from again. The FBI investigated, covered up whatever they found, and kept the whole area off limits, until a random group of people decide to investigate for themselves and write a book about their experiences. First of all, this group of people have no connection to the town, people, or even each other, so why do this? Second, for 70 years the FBI has kept the area off limits to everyone, so what makes this group so special? These idiots march into the woods and the only thing they find is music playing, music that gets progressively louder until it drives them insane. The music is from the Wizard of Oz, but the producers were too cheap to buy the rights to the music from the Wizard of Oz, so it's very similar melodies with different words that nearly drove me to insanity. These idiots romp through the woods makes the Blair Witch Project look like an Oscar worthy film by comparison. It's a lot of talking, and crying, and yelling, that leads to an ending that is by far one of the dumbest things I have ever seen. The ending is the strangest part of all, in that it builds up and plays like it's some huge twist, which maybe it would have been had it made any sense at all.

The few flaws that do pop up suggest inexperience rather than sloppy movie making.  No, I am not saying this is on par with Stalker or Solaris (for those who actually got the Tarkovsky reference), but the approach to film making is similar: The struggle to comprehend the dream vs reality,a sublime nightmare, the power of one's own imagination and consciousness all come to play in this movie if you let yourself go there.So if you want something mindless, something to evoke the gross-out response, pass this one by.
