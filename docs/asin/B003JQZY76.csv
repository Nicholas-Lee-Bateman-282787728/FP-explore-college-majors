1347775,A2582KMXLK2P06,B003JQZY76,B. E Jackson,"[2, 2]","#1 Cheerleader Camp probably deserves all the negative reviews.  It's really bad.  However for some cheap trashy fun and lots of hot female nudity (and I mean LOTS- more than you'd witness in your typical comedy that's for sure) I'm willing to give the movie a free pass.It's about two teenage guys who join the cheerleader camp for one purpose- to play checkers.  I'm kidding of course!  You know why two young men would want to go to a cheerleader camp because the reason practically speaks for itself doesn't it?  Yes, it does.  These two boys basically serve as a reminder just how sex-driven young men really are.Anyway two things happen while at the camp.  The two friends make a bet over who will be the first to score with two chicks at once.  The other more important part of the story is that two competing cheerleader groups want to win a competition but we discover the one group doesn't have enough cheerleaders so it's the job of the two boys to go out and search for some.  Well guess what they do?  They pick up prostitutes much to the displeasure of the girls back at cheerleader camp.  This means when the cheerleader rehearsal is underway, the prostitutes act like prostitutes and not like cheerleaders.  This leads to a few funny scenes.The humor is based entirely around teenage behavior involving sex, nudity, masturbation and such things.  You will definitely get your fill concerning the nudity of the women, that's for sure!  Some of the jokes don't work however, such as the VERY obvious one involving the guy who likes other guys quietly dressed in a beaver costume, and how he tricks the one guy into thinking he's a girl by walking him to the back room.  You knew he was a guy because he didn't say a word until he took his clothes off.  Other jokes such as sexually taking advantage of a watermelon and the ""butt cans"" (yeah, I'm not kidding) missed the mark with me.  WAY too silly.This is not a memorable film by any means.  It's basically pointless nonsense to satisfy the sex addicts who are watching this stuff.  However I've seen worse.  At least it tried to be exciting.  Well until the second half when the entire cheerleader storyline fell completely flat and just dissolved into nothingness for up to 30 minutes.  The writing was obviously very weak overall because there wasn't enough substance to fill up a 90-minute film.  Overall, not bad but nothing particularly great either.",3,yeah... it's not too good,1335916800,"05 2, 2012",2012,2421,"['1', 'Cheerleader', 'Camp', 'probably', 'negative', 'reviews', 'really', 'bad', 'However', 'cheap', 'trashy', 'fun', 'lots', 'hot', 'female', 'nudity', 'mean', 'LOTS-', 'more', ""'d"", 'witness', 'typical', 'comedy', 'sure', ""'m"", 'willing', 'give', 'movie', 'free', 'pass.It', 'two', 'teenage', 'guys', 'who', 'join', 'cheerleader', 'camp', 'one', 'purpose-', 'play', 'checkers', ""'m"", 'kidding', 'course', 'know', 'why', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'would', 'want', 'go', 'cheerleader', 'camp', 'reason', 'practically', ""n't"", 'Yes', 'two', 'boys', 'basically', 'serve', 'reminder', 'just', 'how', 'sex-driven', 'young', 'men', 'really', 'are.Anyway', 'two', 'things', 'happen', 'camp', 'two', 'friends', 'make', 'bet', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'first', 'score', 'two', 'chicks', 'once', 'other', 'more', 'important', 'part', 'story', 'two', 'competing', 'cheerleader', 'groups', 'want', 'win', 'competition', 'discover', 'one', 'group', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'cheerleaders', 'job', 'two', 'boys', 'go', 'out', 'search', 'Well', 'guess', 'what', 'do', 'pick', 'up', 'prostitutes', 'much', 'displeasure', 'girls', 'back', 'cheerleader', 'camp', 'when', 'cheerleader', 'rehearsal', 'underway', 'prostitutes', 'act', 'prostitutes', 'not', 'cheerleaders', 'few', 'funny', 'scenes.The', 'humor', 'based', 'entirely', 'teenage', 'behavior', 'involving', 'sex', 'nudity', 'masturbation', 'such', 'things', 'will', 'definitely', 'get', 'fill', 'concerning', 'nudity', 'women', 'sure', 'jokes', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'however', 'such', 'VERY', 'obvious', 'one', 'involving', 'guy', 'who', 'other', 'guys', 'quietly', 'dressed', 'beaver', 'costume', 'how', 'one', 'guy', 'thinking', 'girl', 'walking', 'back', 'room', 'knew', 'was', 'guy', 'did', ""n't"", 'say', 'word', 'took', 'clothes', 'off', 'Other', 'jokes', 'such', 'sexually', 'taking', 'advantage', 'watermelon', 'butt', 'cans', 'yeah', ""'m"", 'not', 'kidding', 'missed', 'mark', 'WAY', 'too', 'silly.This', 'not', 'memorable', 'film', 'means', 'basically', 'pointless', 'nonsense', 'satisfy', 'sex', 'addicts', 'who', 'are', 'watching', 'stuff', 'However', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'worse', 'least', 'tried', 'be', 'exciting', 'Well', 'second', 'half', 'when', 'entire', 'cheerleader', 'storyline', 'fell', 'completely', 'flat', 'just', 'dissolved', 'nothingness', '30', 'minutes', 'writing', 'was', 'obviously', 'very', 'weak', 'overall', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'substance', 'fill', 'up', '90-minute', 'film', 'Overall', 'not', 'bad', 'nothing', 'particularly', 'great']",#1 Cheerleader Camp

1347778,A3J3EDPVON5MA8,B003JQZY76,H. Perry Horton,"[26, 28]","In the interest of painting myself as objective a reviewer as possible, and not just a raving fanatic, I will say that comedies by The Asylum don't usually do it for me, as they skimp a little too much on story for the sake of sex, drugs and flatulence. But #1 Cheerleader Camp is a pleasant exception, while still fulfilling, in kind, all the aforementioned detractors.Basically Bring it On meets Meatballs with a dash of American Pie: Band Camp, the film concerns two young men who somehow land jobs working maintenance at a cheerleader camp. Naturally, they're in it for the perks. And there are lots of perks. Or at least perky things. Take for instance the opening scene, man's best friend: buxom young ladies on trampolines. For real. The film opens the same way The Man Show used to close. And just in case you're thinking, ""wow, that's incredibly sexist,"" uh-uh, nope, it was written by a woman, so, you know, not sexist.Neither then is the group shower scene, the best - if ""best"" can be conscienably applied to describing a group shower scene - of its kind since Porky's, nor the sprinkler montage, a rival to Phoebe Cates' iconic pool emergence in Fast Times at Ridgemont High. ""How many more references is he going to make?"" you may be asking yourself? None.As for performances, for me the film was made and saved by Seth Cassell, who I really didn't like in Sex Pot, but here found to be more subtle and restrained, thus actually funny. As for the other guy, he was passable, but I was really distracted by the fact that he looks a lot like the douche who plays Ted on How I Met Your Mother. Beyond the principles, there is a bevvy of naked chicks - as though cheerleaders weren't enough, strippers enter about halfway through - a cameo from Mega Piranha hero Paul Logan and Lucy from Dallas (Charlene Tilton) playing herself with unabashed bravado.
