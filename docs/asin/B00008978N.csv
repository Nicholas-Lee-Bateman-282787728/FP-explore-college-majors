No other movie that I can think of better illustrates the creative thought processes of the artist (Nick Nolte) or their sense of lonely isolation.  He cannot live without women and even hilariously tells his young assistant, and I quote from memory, &quot;I don't know anything about love?  I was married and divorced four times before you were even born!&quot;  Nolte is tortured by his desires and his isolation but even lust will not allow him to compromise his artistic integrity.  When Arquette pleads with him concerning whether she has any talent or not, Nolte refuses to lie to appease her.  Instead he elects not to answer her question which infuriates her even more.  Although he is downtrodden throughout much of the film the ending is a happy one.  I own the VHS and have seen the 40 minutes of &quot;Life Lessons&quot; at least seven times over the years.

I just love the interaction between the over-the-top characters, wonderfully portrayed by Allen, Julie Kavner, and yes, Mia is good too -- can't always say that...The real gem here is one of the final performances by Mae Questel, who once upon a time played ""Betty Boop.""  Soon after this performance she began to decline due to Alzheimers.This is the zany, neurotic fun that made Allen's early comedies my favorite part of his opus.  Once upon a time when I was a teacher, I used ""Oedipus Wrecks"" with my students as a ""visual short story.""  I had them write the ending of the story before they saw it.  We had great fun with it.Second I'd vote for Coppola's ""Life Without Zoe"" based, again, on the performances, especially Heather McComb's debut.  She hasn't done much of note since, but I really enjoyed her here.Scorsese's ""Life Lessons"" felt flat to me, despite Nolte and Arquette, both of whom I usually really like.

736082,A1GY4VWXY0747S,B00008978N,FredCritic,"[0, 1]","Skip the Woody Allen and Francis Ford Coppola segments of this anthology.Allen's ""Oedipus Wrecks"" is one of his all-time lesser efforts (yeah, I know, the title sounds terrific, but believe me...).As for Coppola's segment, ""Life Without Zoe"", written by Coppola and his daughter Sofia (yes, the one that won a screenplay Oscar for ""Lost in Translation""), it's little more than a glorified after-school t.v. special.This leaves us with the superb first segment, ""Life Lessons"", directed by Martin Scorsese, and written by Richard Price, who was on a roll at the time (he also wrote ""Sea of Love"" and ""The Color of Money"").  This segment is about artistic process; i.e., whatever it is that a person has to put himself through in order to create.For those that don't create, the creator in this film (a painter, played by Nick Nolte) will probably come across as goofy, strange, self-centered, self-absorbed, hedonistic, controlling, and possibly insane.  For those that don't create, they will quite likely alternate between laughing at his antics and despising his antics.For those that do create, the Nolte character will quite possibly come across as some sort of extraordinarily disciplined, beyond-workaholic, compassionate, lucid, dedicated, selfless human sacrafice.  But they, also, will quite likely alternate between laughing at his antics and despising his antics.Different POV's, but essentially the same reaction to the Nolte character. Think about that. Could it be that people, in general, avoid the subject of artistic process?  At one point in the film Nick Nolte's character, the painter, informs his sponsor, an art gallery owner who exhibits Nolte's paintings, that he's not going to be able to create the paintings needed to exhibit (he's working against a three-week deadline and needs to create ""x"" amount of paintings of high quality in order to show).  Nolte's sponsor reminds him that he has exhibited many times before and that he always manages to pull it off; that he needs to ""get to know himself better.""  And how does the Nolte character field that?  He stares blankly at his sponsor and then turns and walks away. Even the person that is actually, literally going through the artistic process does not want to confront and analyze what he's going through. (Another case of ""don't wanna go near them thar hills""?)Now, let's see what we have here. The painter, the creative one in the film, is evading the subject of artistic process. His ""victim"" in the film is evading the subject (Nolte's long-suffering ""assistant"" in the movie, played quite effectively by Rosanna Arquette, who has the thankless task of having to live with ""The Lion"").  And his sponsor is also evading the subject. (These two people pretty much comprise all of Nolte's ""social"" contacts in the film.)  Oh, and of course, to reiterate, we have non-creative types and creative types watching the film that evade the subject matter.This leads me to: What is the film trying to say...?What if the film attempted to or actually was able to provide answers to the questions posed (What is artistic process?  Why do we have to go through it in order to create? And so forth). What good would it do if we were to answer these questions?  If a person were ""to go near them thar hills"" would it somehow destroy the process and kill creativity?  If so, what would be the point?It appears to me that the film is saying that it would be best not to go near them thar hills.  The film ends with the Nolte character starting the artistic process all over again.  His showing at the art gallery is successful, and he is now starting the artistic process over again, going back into the cycle.You're left feeling kind of sorry for the Nolte character and maybe especially sorry for his next ""victim""; however, those feelings are strongly mitigated by the knowledge that more great art, more fantastic paintings, will come from the artistic process.",3,Evading the subject of artistic process,1353888000,"11 26, 2012",2012,3934,"['Skip', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'segments', 'anthology.Allen', 'Oedipus', 'Wrecks', 'one', 'all-time', 'lesser', 'efforts', 'yeah', 'know', 'title', 'terrific', 'believe', '.As', 'Coppola', 'segment', 'Life', 'Zoe', 'written', 'Coppola', 'daughter', 'Sofia', 'yes', 'one', 'won', 'screenplay', 'Oscar', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'little', 'more', 'glorified', 'after-school', 't.v', 'special.This', 'superb', 'first', 'segment', 'Life', 'Lessons', 'directed', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'written', 'Richard', 'Price', 'who', 'was', 'roll', 'time', 'also', 'wrote', 'Sea', 'Love', 'Color', 'Money', 'segment', 'artistic', 'process', 'i.e.', 'whatever', 'person', 'put', 'order', 'create.For', 'do', ""n't"", 'create', 'creator', 'film', 'painter', 'played', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'will', 'probably', 'come', 'goofy', 'strange', 'self-centered', 'self-absorbed', 'hedonistic', 'controlling', 'possibly', 'insane', 'do', ""n't"", 'create', 'will', 'quite', 'likely', 'alternate', 'laughing', 'antics', 'despising', 'antics.For', 'do', 'create', 'Nolte', 'character', 'will', 'quite', 'possibly', 'come', 'across', 'sort', 'extraordinarily', 'disciplined', 'beyond-workaholic', 'compassionate', 'lucid', 'dedicated', 'selfless', 'human', 'sacrafice', 'also', 'will', 'quite', 'likely', 'alternate', 'laughing', 'antics', 'despising', 'antics.Different', 'POV', 'essentially', 'same', 'reaction', 'Nolte', 'character', 'Think', 'Could', 'be', 'people', 'general', 'avoid', 'subject', 'artistic', 'process', 'one', 'point', 'film', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'character', 'painter', 'sponsor', 'art', 'gallery', 'owner', 'who', 'Nolte', 'paintings', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'able', 'create', 'paintings', 'needed', 'exhibit', 'working', 'three-week', 'deadline', 'needs', 'create', 'x', 'amount', 'paintings', 'high', 'quality', 'order', 'show', 'Nolte', 'sponsor', 'exhibited', 'many', 'times', 'always', 'pull', 'off', 'get', 'know', 'better', 'how', 'Nolte', 'character', 'field', 'blankly', 'sponsor', 'then', 'turns', 'walks', 'away', 'Even', 'person', 'actually', 'literally', 'going', 'artistic', 'process', 'not', 'want', 'confront', 'analyze', 'what', 'going', 'case', 'do', ""n't"", 'wan', 'go', 'thar', 'hills', 'Now', 'let', 'see', 'what', 'have', 'here', 'painter', 'creative', 'one', 'film', 'evading', 'subject', 'artistic', 'process', 'victim', 'film', 'evading', 'subject', 'Nolte', 'long-suffering', 'assistant', 'movie', 'played', 'quite', 'effectively', 'Rosanna', 'Arquette', 'who', 'thankless', 'task', 'having', 'live', 'Lion', 'sponsor', 'also', 'evading', 'subject', 'two', 'people', 'pretty', 'much', 'comprise', 'Nolte', 'social', 'contacts', 'film', 'Oh', 'course', 'reiterate', 'have', 'non-creative', 'types', 'creative', 'types', 'watching', 'film', 'evade', 'subject', 'matter.This', 'What', 'film', 'trying', 'say', 'What', 'film', 'attempted', 'actually', 'was', 'able', 'provide', 'answers', 'questions', 'posed', 'What', 'artistic', 'process', 'Why', 'do', 'have', 'go', 'order', 'create', 'so', 'forth', 'What', 'good', 'would', 'do', 'were', 'answer', 'questions', 'person', 'were', 'go', 'thar', 'hills', 'would', 'somehow', 'process', 'kill', 'creativity', 'so', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'point', 'film', 'saying', 'would', 'be', 'best', 'not', 'go', 'thar', 'hills', 'film', 'Nolte', 'character', 'starting', 'artistic', 'process', 'over', 'again', 'showing', 'art', 'gallery', 'successful', 'now', 'starting', 'artistic', 'process', 'again', 'going', 'back', 'cycle.You', ""'re"", 'left', 'feeling', 'kind', 'sorry', 'Nolte', 'character', 'maybe', 'especially', 'sorry', 'next', 'victim', 'however', 'feelings', 'are', 'strongly', 'mitigated', 'knowledge', 'more', 'great', 'art', 'more', 'fantastic', 'paintings', 'will', 'come', 'artistic', 'process']",N/A

What a magnificent work - visually it is as powerful as the painting Nolte's Lionel was painting. Combining in one short film Procul Harum's ""A whiter shade of pale"" and Puccini's ""Nessun Dorma"" from ""Turandot"" was a stroke of genius. This film is an ode to the power of talent; it is about greatness and curse of the gift, not about love to the woman. The best scene of the film and I'd say one of the best ever made about the Artist's work is Nolte triumphantly painting his masterpiece - his love, desire, lust, cries, whispers, tears, and humiliations magically transform with every stroke of his brush into the immortal, triumphant, brilliant work of art. By the time the painting is finished, he would need a new source of inspiration and self-torture, and the cycle will repeat over again. Devilishly clever portrait of an Artist as Not a Young Man. 9.5/10 (4.5/5)I loved Woody Allen's ""Oedipus Wrecks"" and I think it is very funny and touching. Looks like Allen has met mothers or grandmothers like Mrs. Millstein in real life and his little gem is his love-hate letter to them. In the end, mom always knows what is best for her little boy. Mae Questel and Julie Kavner (Marge Simpson) were wonderful. Woody's face after his mom ""disappears"" and the scene when he practically makes love to the chicken drumstick are pure delight; also the commentary that New York is used to everything and readily accepts the crazy situation - it is so true. One of the best Allen's films I've seen lately - I am very glad that I finally saw it.Larry David (""Seinfeld"", ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"") plays the Theater Manager. It made me think if Estelle Costanza created by David and Mrs. Millstein (Woody's omnipresent mother) have a lot in common in making the lives of their sons miserable and smothering them with their merciless love? 9/10 (4/5)Coppola's ""Life Without Zo"" was much weaker than Scorsese's and Allan's stories and paled in comparison - this episode ""from the lives of the reach and beautiful"" was pretty and cute but you can skip it. 5/10 (2.5/5)",4,"New York, New York",1173657600,"03 12, 2007",2007,2384,"['anthology', 'three', 'short', 'films', 'take', 'place', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'was', 'made', 'three', 'great', 'American', 'directors', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'Life', 'Lessons', 'directed', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'literally', 'took', 'breath', 'away', 'made', 'want', 'rewatch', 'Scorsese', 'films', 'one', 'exception', 'GONY', 'though', 'What', 'magnificent', 'work', 'visually', 'as', 'powerful', 'painting', 'Nolte', 'Lionel', 'was', 'painting', 'Combining', 'one', 'short', 'film', 'Procul', 'Harum', 'A', 'whiter', 'shade', 'pale', 'Puccini', 'Nessun', 'Dorma', 'Turandot', 'was', 'stroke', 'genius', 'film', 'ode', 'power', 'talent', 'greatness', 'curse', 'gift', 'not', 'love', 'woman', 'best', 'scene', 'film', ""'d"", 'say', 'one', 'best', 'ever', 'made', 'Artist', 'work', 'Nolte', 'triumphantly', 'painting', 'masterpiece', 'love', 'desire', 'lust', 'cries', 'whispers', 'tears', 'humiliations', 'magically', 'transform', 'stroke', 'brush', 'immortal', 'triumphant', 'brilliant', 'work', 'art', 'time', 'painting', 'finished', 'would', 'need', 'new', 'source', 'inspiration', 'self-torture', 'cycle', 'will', 'repeat', 'over', 'again', 'Devilishly', 'clever', 'portrait', 'Artist', 'Not', 'Young', 'Man', '9.5/10', '4.5/5', 'loved', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Oedipus', 'Wrecks', 'think', 'very', 'funny', 'touching', 'Allen', 'met', 'mothers', 'grandmothers', 'Mrs.', 'Millstein', 'real', 'life', 'little', 'gem', 'love-hate', 'letter', 'end', 'mom', 'always', 'what', 'best', 'little', 'boy', 'Mae', 'Questel', 'Julie', 'Kavner', 'Marge', 'Simpson', 'were', 'wonderful', 'Woody', 'face', 'mom', 'disappears', 'scene', 'when', 'practically', 'love', 'chicken', 'drumstick', 'are', 'pure', 'delight', 'also', 'commentary', 'New', 'York', 'used', 'everything', 'readily', 'crazy', 'situation', 'so', 'true', 'One', 'best', 'Allen', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lately', 'am', 'very', 'glad', 'finally', 'saw', 'it.Larry', 'David', 'Seinfeld', 'Curb', 'Enthusiasm', 'Theater', 'Manager', 'made', 'think', 'Estelle', 'Costanza', 'created', 'David', 'Mrs.', 'Millstein', 'Woody', 'omnipresent', 'mother', 'have', 'lot', 'common', 'making', 'lives', 'sons', 'miserable', 'smothering', 'merciless', 'love', '9/10', '4/5', 'Coppola', 'Life', 'Without', 'Zo', 'was', 'much', 'weaker', 'Scorsese', 'Allan', 'stories', 'paled', 'comparison', 'episode', 'lives', 'reach', 'beautiful', 'was', 'pretty', 'cute', 'can', 'skip', '5/10', '2.5/5']",N/A

Don Novello as her protector/butler puts in some good acting chops, and there's a nifty bit for Chris Elliot as an upscale crook, but otherwise this isn't much.The high points are the first and last segments. As a passionate obsessive ego-maniacal artist, Nick Nolte--in Martin Scorsese's Life Lessons--is absolutely perfect. He dominates this piece, as well he should, frenziedly painting his huge canvases while soaking in 70s rock--especially Procol Harum, Cream, and Bob Dylan. Rosanna Arquette, as his sexy assistant, provides the complementary tension he needs to give this intense piece its powerful momentum. This is a superior short film, one of the best in the last 20 years.Woody Allen's closing piece, Oedipus Wrecks, is a spiffy closer in which the viewer gets to see Larry David (of Curb Your Enthusiasm) circa 1989, and in which the protagonist's (Woody) mother winds up as a floating head in the Manhattan skyline. Don't ask. Just see it. It's a real hoot.This is worth owning for the Scorsese and the Allen pieces; the Coppola is froth, but at least it goes down easy.",4,"Two parts juice, one part froth",1214611200,"06 28, 2008",2008,1369,"['middle', 'segment', 'trilogy', 'written', 'director', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'daughter', 'pretty', 'clearly', 'thinly', 'disguised', 'portrait', 'right', 'director', 'daughter', 'wife', 'daughter', 'spoiled', 'rotten', 'off', 'just', 'scene', 'Don', 'Novello', 'protector/butler', 'good', 'acting', 'chops', 'nifty', 'bit', 'Chris', 'Elliot', 'upscale', 'crook', 'otherwise', ""n't"", 'much.The', 'high', 'points', 'are', 'first', 'last', 'segments', 'passionate', 'obsessive', 'ego-maniacal', 'artist', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'Life', 'Lessons', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'piece', 'as', 'well', 'should', 'frenziedly', 'painting', 'huge', 'canvases', 'soaking', '70s', 'rock', 'especially', 'Procol', 'Harum', 'Cream', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'Rosanna', 'Arquette', 'sexy', 'assistant', 'complementary', 'tension', 'give', 'intense', 'piece', 'powerful', 'momentum', 'superior', 'short', 'film', 'one', 'best', 'last', '20', 'years.Woody', 'Allen', 'closing', 'piece', 'Oedipus', 'Wrecks', 'spiffy', 'closer', 'viewer', 'see', 'Larry', 'David', 'Curb', 'Your', 'Enthusiasm', 'circa', '1989', 'protagonist', 'Woody', 'mother', 'up', 'floating', 'head', 'Manhattan', 'skyline', 'Do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'Just', 'see', 'real', 'hoot.This', 'worth', 'owning', 'Scorsese', 'Allen', 'pieces', 'Coppola', 'froth', 'least', 'down', 'easy']",N/A

They have little in common other than the setting, a bustling NYC and middle-aged men and their relationships.  Martin Scorsese starts things out with the best of the three.  ""Life Lessons"" portrays a Jackson Pollock-like abstractionist painter.  He's well known, successful but is struggling to complete a project for an upcoming art show.  Nick Nolte is excellent in the role.  He fawns over his 22 year old assistant (Rosanna Arquette) who also lives in his huge loft in her own bedroom.  As her tutor, he also became her lover but that is all coming apart.  She wants to move on, but he keeps her around on the premise she needs his help in order to grow.  He resists telling her about her potential until she finally figures it out.  Both characters are annoying as hell.  Lionel (Nolte) smothers Paulette (Arquette) even when he promises their physical relationship has ended. Paulette's meanness is the result of her own self-doubt.  Both need to move on.  Scorsese fully develops his character in the short story.""Life Without Zoe"" by Francis Ford Coppola is essentially a fantasy created and lived by Zoe (Heather McComb), a 12 year old daughter of world traveler parents (Talia Shire and Giancarlo Giannini) about to divorce.  She lives alone most of the time in an upper crust hotel, cared for by the butler (a very good Don Novello) and various hotel staffers. She becomes best friends with ""the richest boy in the world,"" an heir to a sheikdom.  They throw a party; all the other rich kids come.  Yada yada yada.  Will Zoe's neglecting parents reconcile?  Will Zoe be allowed to travel with them?  I didn't care.Finally there is ""Oedipus Wrecks"" from Woody Allen.  Yes he's funny as a law partner (funny premise right there) whose stereotypical Jewish mother (the great Mae Questel) disappears when she becomes part of a magic act.  Many days later she reappears but not in her usual physical self.  She continues to humiliate her son about his choice of a bride who already has 3 children (Mia Farrow), his weight and always manages to mention he was a bed wetter as a kid.  The difference is that everyone in New York now knows this.  Allen isn't off-the-charts hilarious, but this little film certainly has its moments.  Overall I would give the collection a solid O.

I watched the entire movie and I found the first episode, ""Life's Lessons"", to be a compelling tale about an obsessive artist.  His relationship with his former girlfriend is the focus of the story.  The intensity of this segment is its' strength and the ending serves to mock the intensity.  The second segment is a light piece about a rich juvenile girl in Manhatten (all of the stories are centered on Manhatten).  I wasn't drawn into this story but I did come away with a glimpse of how the $ther half lives.For me, the highlight was the third story written by, directed by, and starring Woody Allen.  It is the ode to the Jewish mother and it is hilarious as much as it is heartwarming.  The stereotypes are enlarged to mamouth proportions (literally, at times).  There were so many scenes that had me laughing out loud but, for me, the best was the one where the people in the traffic jam all get out the pictures of their children.  The beauty of this segment was that it was told in just the right amount of time.  It would have been overdone as a full-length movie or even as an 80 minute movie.

The opening short, &quot;Life Lessons&quot; by Martin Scorsese and starring Nick Nolte and Roseann Arquette is a unforgiving look at the competitive, abusive, almost cannibalistic world of a megalomaniacal painter. I read somewhere that this short is flawed because Nolte's character doesn't change. That is not a flaw; that's the point. The ego of a successful artist, according to Scorsese, will not soften, will not learn what a conscience is, will not admit that there are other artists in his/her world. Even when the artist recognizes talent in someone else, it is quickly dismissed. The ego lords over all.The final short film, &quot;Oedipus Wrecks&quot; by Woody Allen is typical comic genius. The plot is simple. Woody takes his overbearing mother to a magic show, and the magician makes her disappear. Completely disappear. The magician himself doesn't know how he did it. When mom appears as an apparition in the clouds, and speaks to the entire population of Gotham about her son, the laughs are endless.In between these two films is one directed by Francis Ford Coppola.
