Well, lemme quit hating the guy. This is a well-intentioned movie, Tom did a creditable job, and we had extreme close-ups with funny colors to camouflage the spots where he overreached. I was also pleasantly surprised to see Antonio Banderas fly in the face of his Latino studliness by playing a gay guy. A passionate one, though, since he's still a Latino, after all.Actually, this is a Hollywood ""message movie,"" and you know what that means. It's about as subtle as Michael Moore. Those who agree with the message flock to be beaten about the head by it for two hours. Those who the filmmakers would like to see the movie, those who don't agree with the message, stay as far away from it as possible.There's a scene in the library where nobody wants to sit at the table with AIDS boy. The way they stared at him reminded me of ""lao wei in China"" experiences. Denzel's character was reminded of segregation, even though he's too young to remember it, and started to care about Tom Hanks' character.AIDS discrimination is bad. Actually, any discrimination at all is bad. And that's the movie's message. I agree with the message, but still. That's all we've got.As a totally irrelevant non-sequiter, if the name ""Sam Francisco"" means anything to you, you've seen subtle commentary on discrimination.I love a great courtroom drama.

9629,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0767809270,Andrew Ellington,"[11, 14]","`Philadelphia' tells the heroic tale of Andrew Beckett, a one time hot young lawyer who was unjustly fired from his job when his superiors discovered he was suffering from the AIDS virus.  At times this film is extremely touching and ultimately it is inspiring, but it suffers from clich&eacute;s and an air of simplicity that robs it of any real emotional impact.  I won't say that this is a bad film; it is just not a great one.Andrew Beckett is young and smart and steadily climbing the corporate ladder in his law firm.  He has a caring young boyfriend and very caring and understanding parents; yet something is terribly wrong.  Andrew has contracted the deadly virus known as AIDS and as time progresses this virus begins to ware away at his health.  He conceals this disease from his workmates, but when his illness becomes visible he is unable to hide it any longer and he finds himself being fired.  Of course the law firm will not admit their reasons are based on his physical condition, but the reason given is so shaky that it leads Beckett to conclude the obvious.  This is when Beckett approaches lawyer Joe Miller to represent him on trial.  Joe turns down the case claiming that he doesn't think Beckett's lawsuit would hold up in court but it is more than obvious that Beckett's condition as well as his `alternative' lifestyle sit crossly with Miller and are the real reasons for his refusal to help.  Joe does have a change of heart though and takes on Beckett as a client.The initial concept for the film (loosely based on a true account) is intriguing and stock full of potential, but I feel as though it missed the boat somewhere.  Many parts of the film seem clich&eacute;d to me, as if they were just presenting us with what we think we are supposed to see.  I can't help but feel too that the film was a tad too simple, one-dimensional even.  There really seemed to be no true character development (aside from Miller) and this just didn't sit right with me.This leads me to Hanks.I have a feeling I am in the minority here but I just didn't appreciate Tom Hanks' performance.  I felt that it was clich&eacute;d and gimmicky and in the end it never really felt `real'.  I never felt like I really knew `who' Andrew Beckett was.  I knew his circumstance and I knew his plight, but I didn't know him.  Hanks tries to explain Beckett to us during an excruciating opera scene where Hanks reaches levels of ridiculousness I just couldn't believe would be omitted in this film.  The scene itself should have been stirring and emotionally reaching but Hanks just didn't get it and it comes off mediocre at best.  As a whole I felt that his performance was weak when compared to his co-stars, especially Denzel, who completely owed his performance.Denzel Washington really surprised me here.  His performance is by far the best in the film, for he actually tells the audience a story.  We know where this man came from, why he feels the way he does; we know what upsets him and what makes him uncomfortable and ultimately we see a progression of character, real growth that delivers to us the man he is when the credits begin to role.  This is much more than can be said for Hanks' portrayal of Andrew Beckett.  In my humble opinion Oscar got this all wrong, awarding Hanks for a playing a gimmick yet snubbing Washington for creating an honest character.The supporting players are decent here, some better than others.  Antonio Banderas has a tendency to over-act, sometimes it works (his Zorro is flawless) and other times it is too much, which is the case here.Director Jonathan Demme had a lot to live up to with all the attention and praise he garnered for `The Silence of the Lambs', but he just couldn't really pull this one together.  The film plays out well, it looks good, and there are moments that touch the audience, but there is not the intended impact; at least not for me.  I know that a lot of people really enjoy this film, laud it even and I know that the critics sang its praises (or at least Hanks' praises) but I can't do either.  The film is important in that it takes its serious subject very seriously and it proved to open the eyes of many to a growing problem, but in the end I'm just not `that' impressed.  Washington is award worthy, that is for sure, but the film as a whole is lacking.",3,An `important' film that is highly `over-hyped'...,1211241600,"05 20, 2008",2008,4333,"['Philadelphia', 'heroic', 'tale', 'Andrew', 'Beckett', 'one', 'time', 'hot', 'young', 'lawyer', 'who', 'was', 'unjustly', 'fired', 'job', 'when', 'superiors', 'discovered', 'was', 'suffering', 'AIDS', 'virus', 'times', 'film', 'extremely', 'touching', 'ultimately', 'inspiring', 'clich', 'eacute', 'air', 'simplicity', 'real', 'emotional', 'impact', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'bad', 'film', 'just', 'not', 'great', 'one.Andrew', 'Beckett', 'young', 'smart', 'steadily', 'climbing', 'corporate', 'ladder', 'law', 'firm', 'caring', 'young', 'boyfriend', 'very', 'caring', 'understanding', 'parents', 'yet', 'something', 'terribly', 'wrong', 'Andrew', 'contracted', 'deadly', 'virus', 'known', 'AIDS', 'time', 'virus', 'ware', 'away', 'health', 'disease', 'workmates', 'when', 'illness', 'visible', 'unable', 'hide', 'longer', 'being', 'fired', 'course', 'law', 'firm', 'will', 'not', 'admit', 'reasons', 'are', 'based', 'physical', 'condition', 'reason', 'given', 'so', 'shaky', 'Beckett', 'conclude', 'obvious', 'when', 'Beckett', 'lawyer', 'Joe', 'Miller', 'represent', 'trial', 'Joe', 'down', 'case', 'claiming', ""n't"", 'think', 'Beckett', 'lawsuit', 'would', 'hold', 'up', 'court', 'more', 'obvious', 'Beckett', 'condition', 'as', 'well', 'alternative', 'lifestyle', 'sit', 'crossly', 'Miller', 'are', 'real', 'reasons', 'refusal', 'help', 'Joe', 'have', 'change', 'heart', 'Beckett', 'client.The', 'initial', 'concept', 'film', 'loosely', 'based', 'true', 'account', 'intriguing', 'stock', 'full', 'potential', 'feel', 'missed', 'boat', 'somewhere', 'Many', 'parts', 'film', 'seem', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'were', 'just', 'presenting', 'what', 'think', 'are', 'supposed', 'see', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'too', 'film', 'was', 'tad', 'too', 'simple', 'one-dimensional', 'even', 'really', 'seemed', 'be', 'true', 'character', 'development', 'aside', 'Miller', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'sit', 'right', 'me.This', 'leads', 'Hanks.I', 'have', 'feeling', 'am', 'minority', 'here', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'performance', 'felt', 'was', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'gimmicky', 'end', 'never', 'really', 'felt', 'real', 'never', 'felt', 'really', 'knew', 'who', 'Andrew', 'Beckett', 'was', 'knew', 'circumstance', 'knew', 'plight', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'Hanks', 'explain', 'Beckett', 'excruciating', 'opera', 'scene', 'where', 'Hanks', 'levels', 'ridiculousness', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'would', 'be', 'omitted', 'film', 'scene', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'stirring', 'emotionally', 'reaching', 'Hanks', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'mediocre', 'best', 'whole', 'felt', 'performance', 'was', 'weak', 'when', 'compared', 'co-stars', 'especially', 'Denzel', 'who', 'completely', 'owed', 'performance.Denzel', 'Washington', 'really', 'surprised', 'here', 'performance', 'far', 'best', 'film', 'actually', 'audience', 'story', 'know', 'where', 'man', 'came', 'why', 'way', 'know', 'what', 'what', 'uncomfortable', 'ultimately', 'see', 'progression', 'character', 'real', 'growth', 'man', 'when', 'credits', 'begin', 'role', 'much', 'more', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Hanks', 'portrayal', 'Andrew', 'Beckett', 'humble', 'opinion', 'Oscar', 'got', 'wrong', 'awarding', 'Hanks', 'playing', 'gimmick', 'yet', 'snubbing', 'Washington', 'creating', 'honest', 'character.The', 'supporting', 'players', 'are', 'decent', 'here', 'better', 'others', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'tendency', 'over-act', 'Zorro', 'flawless', 'other', 'times', 'too', 'much', 'case', 'here.Director', 'Jonathan', 'Demme', 'had', 'lot', 'live', 'up', 'attention', 'praise', 'garnered', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'pull', 'one', 'together', 'film', 'out', 'well', 'good', 'are', 'moments', 'touch', 'audience', 'not', 'intended', 'impact', 'least', 'not', 'know', 'lot', 'people', 'really', 'enjoy', 'film', 'laud', 'even', 'know', 'critics', 'sang', 'praises', 'least', 'Hanks', 'praises', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'either', 'film', 'important', 'serious', 'subject', 'very', 'seriously', 'proved', 'open', 'eyes', 'many', 'growing', 'problem', 'end', ""'m"", 'just', 'not', 'impressed', 'Washington', 'award', 'worthy', 'sure', 'film', 'whole', 'lacking']",N/A

Before that scares you off, though, it's handled in such a manner that even those with the most delicate senses won't be offended.Philadelphia chooses to forgive instead of judge (Which is ironical, since it's basically a court-room drama.) It chooses to include instead of exclude, and the theme of tolerance works without being sappy. I'm not a homophobe but I'm not a liberal, either. Still, with the exceptional screen writing and extraordinary acting by Hanks and Washington, I could see from homosexuals' viewpoints without judging or disliking them in the least. I have to say this movie changed my perception quite a bit.Oh, and that scene with Tom Hanks and the opera... I could feel tears welling up in my eyes. I was so completely caught up in this character, I felt a pain in my heart like a twisting knife. If you've ever lost someone you love prematurely, you'll know what I mean.Every aspect of the movie worked just fine.

It also includes three actors I love: Tom Hanks, Denzel Washington, and Antonio Banderas. How can it lose?Andrew Beckett (Hanks) is fired from his law firm when the partners discover he has AIDS. They set him up with a phoney incompetence incident (complaint due that day disappears, reappears as mysteriously within minutes of time to get it to the courthouse) which he can see right through. So he wants to file a suit for wrongful termination. Joe Miller (Washington) is the ninth attorney he consults, who is plainly homophobic. In fact, his wife calls him out on it, and he admits it. However, after he catches Beckett in the law library trying to prepare the case for himself (It's a long-standing legal tradition that a lawyer who represents himself has a fool for a client.), and being hassled by the library clerk, he decides to accept the case.Antonio Banderas plays Beckett's boyfriend, who has been taught how to give him his IV treatments so he doesn't have to be forever in hospital or clinic, and is generally a very likeable partner. It's easy to see why they love each other; they're both attractive, intelligent and compassionate.And that's what a lot of the story is about: the audience, the jury, and the general public are forced to face the fact that gay people are people. Seen through the lens of the old partners of his firm, who tell crude homophobic jokes in the steam room of the athletic club, the response is that they probably did not know he was gay. But one partner ""suspected,"" as he brought out. And another had worked with a woman who had AIDS at a previous firm, mentioning in his testimony that he had the greatest sympathy for people like her who got this terrible disease ""through no fault of their own."" She testified that she had a blood transfusion after her second child was born, and that's how she got AIDS. The implication, of course, was that he had no sympathy for people who got it through homosexual activity. One of the jurors is heard to comment under his breath, ""Got what was coming to him.""Funny side story: The lead trial lawyer for the firm, played by Mary Steenbengen, had the bitch female attorney role so down pat I had to look at the credits to make sure she was not being played by someone I knew at the Superior Court in Santa Cruz. Actually, I think I've seen her play female attorneys before, probably in one or more of Robert Grisham's excellent courtroom dramas.Fine movie, something of a tear jerker, but also a real eye-opener to the biases against gays and victims of AIDS.

Hanks plays Andrew  Beckett, a gay, AIDS infected corporate attorney who is fired from his  position at a prestigious law office for supposed incompetence.  Washington  portrays Joe Miller, a small time ambulance chaser who, when he reluctantly  consents to represent Beckett in a rafter rattling wrongful dismissal  lawsuit, is compelled to confront his own feelings and misconceptions, not  only towards homosexuality and AIDS, but toward everything and everyone in  this world which is perceived to be different.Prior to this offering,  Tom Hanks had a large stable of fans who admired and appreciated his comic  efforts in movies such as &quot;Splash,&quot; &quot;Big,&quot; and &quot;A  League Of Their Own.&quot;  But in this film, a film that was literally  crying out to be created, he proved that as an actor, he has great  versatility and can be cast in a wide variety of roles.  There can be no  argument that this is his finest performance, and for those that love this  movie, his Oscar is merely the icing on the cake.Undoubtedly  controversial, &quot;Philadelphia&quot; is a haunting picture which will  make the viewer think.

Though it certainly wasn't the first film to deal with AIDS, ""Philadelphia"" was the first major studio to take on the subject with an A-list cast. As attorney Andrew Beckett seeking to challenge his job termination in court, Tom Hanks, of course, won the first of his two back-to-back Oscars (""Forrest Gump"" followed a year later), and has solid support by Denzel Washington as the reluctant fellow attorney who pleads Beckett's case; Jason Robards, in the dispassionate role of the law partner who orchestrates Beckett's dismissal; Antonio Banderas as Beckett's lover; and Joanne Woodward as Beckett's supportive mother. On that count, the film may be somewhat idealistic in that, tragically, not all gay and AIDS-infected men have the support of their families. But the film does provide important social commentary on institutional prejudice and case law as it applies to the person with AIDS. Sadly, while the film ends with some measure of justice for Beckett, his real-life counterpart was not successful in winning his case against the employer who fired him.

Sure this film tackled the AIDS/homosexuality issue head-on but that doesn't automatically make it a great film. I'm not knocking this film, of course not. But there's a lot of parts in it that I didn't like which maybe made it appear to be a lesser film than what it wants to be, it is or what everyone makes it out to be.Andrew Beckett works for a prestigious law firm working on a big account. His health declines a little bit nothing overly serious until he's fired for apparently botching the case. Turns out not only is he a homosexual but he has AIDS so he figures that's why he was fired. He needs representation so he hires Joe Miller, a top and famous attorney who is, rather bluntly, very intolerant of gays. So they form an unlikely duo to battle a top firm while dealing with gay bashers to closet gays.One small nitpick: it seemed like anyone that is in Andy's family or friends circle is against him. There was not a lot of normal everyman citizens who supported him. A similar problem in Brokeback Mountain where any scene with the 2 men was gorgeously shot while them with their wives looked rather bland and desolate looking, complete with sad looking wives. It's nothing that derails the film though. And I don't know why but I never liked Jonathan Demme's trademark of looking in the camera. It works for Silence of the Lambs but here it looks...weird, and maybe a bit too on the nose.Now Tom Hanks did win the award for Best Actor but honestly it should've went to Denzel Washington who manages to be visibly struggling with his less-than-enthusiastic view on gays and the changing perspectives dealing with the case. Hanks, in a way, reminds me of Charlize Theron who put on ugly makeup for Monster. Losing a crapload of weight does not automatically give you an Oscar. No knock against Hanks but it seems funny it went to him instead of Washington.Is it a watchable film? Of course, it's quite good and performances are excellent.

And yet the movie is not really about a man with AIDS, as all the critics say it should be, and then berate it because it isn't; it's about society's reaction to gays and AIDS, a much broader subject.  On that scale, it delivers well.  We don't need detail scenes of Tom Hanks and his lover, or his facing the disease, or any other of the nitty-gritty the critics said was lacking.  I think they missed the point entirely.  Washington was society, and his slow progression from homophobia to understanding is what Demme is trying to say to the audience.

Its production was extra crutial being that during the time of release, many were still severely fearing AIDS.  The producers accomplish every scene wonderfully.  The movie's portrayal of AIDS and its victims is very accurate to reality.  The plot was written beautifully, though sad.  It explores more than just AIDS; it explores discrimination against those who have it and against homosexuals.  Such combination remains ahead of its time.  The plot becomes more interesting as Andy Beckett's lawyer becomes more educated about such issues and begins changing his beliefs about them.  Its emotional impact is intense, never held back for a second.  It forces audiences to feel the events.  The movie is more than entertainment; it's also educational.Tom Hanks's Oscar winning performance as Beckett is heartwrenching.  His every drop of heart and soul was poured through his performance.  His previous hardcore research about the lifestyle, the disease, and the actual events is obvious.  This is one of many movies that proves that Tom Hanks is one of the best actors in history.  Denzel Washington's performance as Beckett's lawyer is beautiful.  His acting skill proves very crutial in his character's personality and point of view.  All other actors, major or minor, also perform their roles wonderfully.  Everyone, including Hanks and Washington, offers their own useful emotional prospective to this movie.Bruce Springsteen's Oscar winning song ""Streets of Philadelphia"" is a beautiful way to begin the movie.  Its dark theme matches the plot perfectly.  It also offers new prospectives to the movie.  This song will be a classic in the following years.  The original score was also composed beautifully(not by Springsteen), giving the movie more intensity and emotion.The make-up team's research of AIDS and its victims proved highly crutial.  Their work on Tom Hanks was highly accurate to reality.  There were no flaws to the physical symptoms, ranging from skin tone, changing hair color, lesions, and eyes.""Philadelphia"" is a great movie for those looking for a powerdrama.

9659,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,0767809270,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[4, 5]","PHILADELPHIA (Dir. Jonathan Demme, 1993, 127 minutes, allegedly inspired in part by Geoffrey Bowers' AIDS discrimination lawsuit) is an all-time classic masterpiece of cinema. Not only is it probably the most important AIDS-themed film ever, it is also one of the most important films ever made.Tom Hanks is Andy Beckett, a powerful corporate lawyer who is suffering from HIV and hiding it from the monster firm where he is employed. The next thing we know he has full-blown AIDS and is jobless. He appeals to an old colleague, Joe Miller (a stunning Denzel Washington in what I consider to be his 'come-out' role) to initiate a wrongful termination suit against the monster corporation. Meanwhile we see the disease as it ravages Andy.This film was important and will forever be, for me personally, significant. At that stage, the early 1990s, people were still ignorant and paranoid as hell. One of my sisters, sometime earlier than this, accused me of having AIDS and hiding the fact. She would not listen; I'd been tested under circumstances that seemed like the ultimate spy story, due to the paranoia. I showed her my test results. Nothing. She still thinks I have it, but says nothing.The entire second half of the 1980s was taken up for me with AIDS volunteer work. I knew we could beat it, defeat it and end the plague of the 20th century. However, first we had to change attitudes. Demme chose to take key moments and have the actors act out their lines directly to the camera, that is, directly to the audience as if in challenge. For me, it was always a moving, sad experience. This film also changed the outlook of many people. I knew folks who ran home to bathe and scrub the hell out of themselves if they'd even seen someone they thought looked sick. PHILADELPHIA partially changed that attitude.Antonio Banderas, though having about 10 minutes of screen time, did a wonderful job as Andy's boyfriend. I also noted that some of the extras in the film were actually ill. Demme made the paradigm shift happen, and I am convinced that shift saved lives. If you have seen this - and I don't really see how you can have missed it - you'll want to see it again; if not, SEE IT, and own it.I have heard trivia about this movie: over 50 gay men who were ill appeared in it; within the year almost 95% of them were dead. There also, at the end in Andy's party, is Quentin Crisp, the major gay inspiration for us all. Even then-mayor Ed Rendell, another hero of mine, appeared (in a TV interview) and did it 'cold'. Most courageous of all in my view is that Andy dies from acute CMV (Cytomegalovirus), which was a common cause of death for AIDS patients. Think about all that when you see this.Also, I recommendLongtime Companionas a companion piece to this film.This movie changed outlooks, attitudes and it saved lives.

It's a disease that I read about or I see clips about it on the news, but I've never knowingly had a close encounter with anyone who actually had it.

I guess most people would probably keep such information to themselves;In any case, my Ross Stores bargain-bin DVD movie for tonight was ""Philadelphia"" staring Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington. Hanks played a brilliant up-and-coming lawyer who was dismissed by his law firm because he was suspected of having AIDS. It turned out that he did have AIDS, but he was illegally fired because that ailment is protected under the disabilities act. Ultimately, the case got to court with Washington acting as Hanks lawyer.

There needs to be more positive movies showing family support today.The music of Bruce Springsteen and Neil Young fit in perfectly with the scenes of the film.  People often overlook Neil Young's song and normally I do not like Mr. Young's music.

This is definitely one of Denzel Washington's best performances, but I have to believe that has a lot to do with the fact that the best actor of our time, Tom Hanks, played the starring role.  The interaction between both actors, and the beautiful characters they create, bring more goosebump worthy scenes to the screen than any movie has the right to have.  In what I consider to be Tom Hanks' single greatest scene of his career, I watched a moment that truly made me forget where I was.  Washington plays an ambulance-chaser who takes Hanks' lawsuit over AIDS discrimination, against his better judgement.  The opera scene, where Tom Hanks, walking around his apartment with an IV bag, explains to Washington about the pain and emotional struggle of a fictional character in an opera.  This scene is absolute perfection.  From the camera angles, to the lighting, to the performance by both actors, true emotion pouring through their skin to the very screen itself.  This scene has no peer.  The film is a great creation, from beginning to end, but, it is a must-own for anyone, purely because of this one moment.

The Defense (who represents the Law Firm who fired Andy Beckette) tries to make Andy Beckett's lifestyleand often times varying performances at workagainst him to try to bring down his reputation and his case.From a law point of view, the movie is Excellent.From a Film making point of view, the movie is Excellent.From a societal message , point of view, ''Philadelphia'' is Excellent.Jason Robards, plays Charles Wheeler, a sickening, prejudice man who resembles the most disgusting corporate boss there is: The corporate boss, who pretends to be friends with his coworkers or clients, only to stabbed them  in the back later. He will do only anything to benefit himself.At the beginning, Wheeler pretends to be Andy's friend, heck he even ask him for legal advice on a special antitrust case called ''Highlite vs. Sander Systems''.  Andy Beckett's becomes fired, from the job, once they find out he has aids, but try to make it look he was fired for other reasons. The movie also greatly shows the prejudices, and misconception people have about aids.However, Director Jonathan Demme does bring up some controversial areas for example Andy was a guy with many sexual partners, and so his diagnosis of the Aids Virus while dating Miguel Alvarez (Antonio Banderas) is not surprisingat all. In fact the defense uses Andy's personal history against him very well.Denzel Washington plays Jospeh Miller, the lawyer Beckette eventually to try to bring his AIDS case to court.Miller himself, at first, displays his own prejudices against people with AIDS. When  Beckette, touches items in his office, his face becomes terrified, showing his fear and ignorance that perhaps he will catch AIDS from Beckette.Another gritty scene that shows people ignorance and prejudice is the library scene in which Andy Beckette, is conducting researching for his AIDS case against the lawfirm that illegally fired him.  The librarian in the library, first asks Andy Beckette, if he would be more comfortable in a study room, but then it becomes evident that the the ignorant librarian is telling not asking Andy Beckette to go to another room.Andy being, a very proud man, refuses showing his true dignity even while having AIDS.Joseph Miller (Washington) eventually agrees to become Andy's lawyer and this is where more powerful scenes are shown along with brilliant and well scripted performances.''Justice is blind regardless of color, sex and religion.'' is the line that the Judge in the case uses to ensure the parties involved that this will be a fair case.  ''Philadelphia'' gathered many Oscar Nominations including Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor leading to Denzel Washington winning for Best Actor.''Philadelphia'' is not the only movie that deals with the issue of AIDS, but it is by far one of the best made.I Highly Recommended this movie for both educational reasons (educate people about AIDS along with the ignorant misconception people have about it), and for Journalistic and Filmmaking reasons.An Oscar worthy film that has to be seen.There is a dvd available for ''Philadelphia'' but unfortunately no, special features are given but still a great film.",5,The Oscar Winning Philadelphia with Hanks,1088640000,"07 1, 2004",2004,3873,"['March', 'was', 'Oscar', 'month', 'TCM', 'Turner', 'Classic', 'Movies', 'who', 'showcase', 'great', 'Oscar', 'movied', 'showed', 'Philadelphia', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'powerful', 'movie', 'well', 'educated', 'hardworking', 'lawyer', 'named', 'Andy', 'Beckette', 'who', 'contracts', 'AIDS', 'then', 'illegally', 'prejudicely', 'fired', 'law', 'firm', 'when', 'find', 'out', 'AIDS.The', 'movie', 'nothing', 'short', 'Excellent', 'demonstrating', 'not', 'only', 'cold-blooded', 'hypocritical', 'members', 'corporte', 'society', 'indignities', 'prejudices', 'people', 'living', 'AIDS', 'have', 'go', 'through.The', 'movie', 'also', 'brilliantly', 'courtroom', 'tactics', 'defendants', 'lawyers', 'will', 'use', 'order', 'win', 'case', 'Defense', 'who', 'Law', 'Firm', 'who', 'fired', 'Andy', 'Beckette', 'make', 'Andy', 'Beckett', 'lifestyleand', 'often', 'varying', 'performances', 'workagainst', 'try', 'bring', 'down', 'reputation', 'case.From', 'law', 'point', 'view', 'movie', 'Film', 'making', 'point', 'view', 'movie', 'societal', 'message', 'point', 'view', 'Philadelphia', 'Excellent.Jason', 'Robards', 'Charles', 'Wheeler', 'sickening', 'prejudice', 'man', 'who', 'most', 'disgusting', 'corporate', 'boss', 'corporate', 'boss', 'who', 'be', 'friends', 'coworkers', 'clients', 'only', 'stabbed', 'back', 'later', 'will', 'do', 'only', 'anything', 'benefit', 'beginning', 'Wheeler', 'be', 'Andy', 'friend', 'heck', 'even', 'ask', 'legal', 'advice', 'special', 'antitrust', 'case', 'called', 'Highlite', 'vs.', 'Sander', 'Systems', 'Andy', 'Beckett', 'becomes', 'fired', 'job', 'once', 'find', 'out', 'aids', 'try', 'make', 'look', 'was', 'fired', 'other', 'reasons', 'movie', 'also', 'greatly', 'prejudices', 'misconception', 'people', 'have', 'aids.However', 'Director', 'Jonathan', 'Demme', 'bring', 'up', 'controversial', 'areas', 'example', 'Andy', 'was', 'guy', 'many', 'sexual', 'partners', 'so', 'diagnosis', 'Aids', 'Virus', 'dating', 'Miguel', 'Alvarez', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'not', 'surprisingat', 'fact', 'defense', 'Andy', 'personal', 'history', 'very', 'well.Denzel', 'Washington', 'Jospeh', 'Miller', 'lawyer', 'Beckette', 'eventually', 'try', 'bring', 'AIDS', 'case', 'court.Miller', 'first', 'displays', 'own', 'prejudices', 'people', 'AIDS', 'When', 'Beckette', 'items', 'office', 'face', 'terrified', 'showing', 'fear', 'ignorance', 'perhaps', 'will', 'catch', 'AIDS', 'Beckette.Another', 'gritty', 'scene', 'people', 'ignorance', 'prejudice', 'library', 'scene', 'Andy', 'Beckette', 'conducting', 'researching', 'AIDS', 'case', 'lawfirm', 'illegally', 'fired', 'librarian', 'library', 'first', 'Andy', 'Beckette', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'comfortable', 'study', 'room', 'then', 'evident', 'ignorant', 'librarian', 'telling', 'not', 'asking', 'Andy', 'Beckette', 'go', 'room.Andy', 'being', 'very', 'proud', 'man', 'showing', 'true', 'dignity', 'even', 'having', 'AIDS.Joseph', 'Miller', 'Washington', 'eventually', 'become', 'Andy', 'lawyer', 'where', 'more', 'powerful', 'scenes', 'are', 'shown', 'brilliant', 'well', 'scripted', 'performances', ""''Justice"", 'blind', 'regardless', 'color', 'sex', 'religion', 'line', 'Judge', 'case', 'ensure', 'parties', 'involved', 'will', 'be', 'fair', 'case', 'gathered', 'many', 'Oscar', 'Nominations', 'including', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'leading', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'winning', 'Best', 'Actor', 'not', 'only', 'movie', 'deals', 'issue', 'AIDS', 'far', 'one', 'best', 'made.I', 'Highly', 'Recommended', 'movie', 'educational', 'reasons', 'educate', 'people', 'AIDS', 'ignorant', 'misconception', 'people', 'have', 'Journalistic', 'Filmmaking', 'reasons.An', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'film', 'be', 'seen.There', 'dvd', 'available', 'Philadelphia', 'unfortunately', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'given', 'still', 'great', 'film']",N/A

But the film is not interesting so much because of this plot, but because of the high level of human contradictions and inhuman bigotry invested in every sequence of it.A young brilliant and promising lawyer gets recruited by one important law firm in Philadelphia and within some years he is entrusted with one of the most important cases they have ever had in their hands. But within a few weeks he is purely and simply fired for incompetence. The logic of this extremely fast career and the swiftness with which it is broken is of course suspicious. The lawyer is gay and has aids.The lawyer goes to court and all the lawyers he contacts to represent him refuse, including a friend of his, his tenth and last chance. But that's how America was in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Afraid and fundamentally hostile to gay people in the name of anything that could justify their bigotry, and first of all their reading of the Bible.The tenth lawyer finally accepts to represent him because of the Federal Vocational Rehabilitation Act of 1973 that prevents any kind of discrimination for any kind of handicap, provided the work required is done properly. They find some jurisprudence and one antecedent case in which a court accepted to consider AIDS as being such a physical condition that could be considered as a handicap and thus any hostile attitude or any attitude that will not treat such a person as any other is discrimination.The plot is simple, I said, and the case is won with a hefty amount of damages, about 5 millions.The film is very strong because the lawyer will have a final seizure in court and the trial will go on and come to an end in his absence. The sentence will be pronounced, him being still alive in hospital. They all, his family, his lawyer and some friends, convened in his room to celebrate the sentence but he will not survive this evening and will die in the night in the sole presence of his partner. The court decision will not be appealed because you cannot introduce a legal suit against a dead person. The trial became history and jurisprudence, common law as some call it.The acting is of course essential and it is true at times the situations and the hatred of homophobic people make that acting iffy in many ways, skating on the thin ice of the civil war some would like to start to exterminate these agents of the devil gay people are accused of being. But the judge himself, at the end of the trial, when the boss of the law firm is testifying, seems to be becoming less tolerant with their antics and forces that boss to answer some very embarrassing questions, embarrassing for the law firm of course, like the treatment this lawyer and ten of his ship mates when he was in the navy submitted one gay sailor to. Too gross to even quote the script.This film also made history because of its Best Actor Oscar. Public opinion in the USA started to turn in that period after the strict rejection of AIDS as the gay plague and hence, like all plagues since even before Moses, the punishment of God against sin, in this case against homosexuals. But starting only because in 1996 Bill Clinton managed to get the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) passed in Congress. One of the most vicious and pernicious laws against gay people.And only twenty years later (DOMA) was finally ruled unconstitutional at federal level by the US Supreme Court. Twenty long years of legal segregation at federal level. And only thirteen states so far have legalized gay marriage. The road is still long, even if thirteen states are enough to block any possible amendment to the US constitution that requires thirty-eight states to be ratified.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,"Don't Ask Don 't Tell, Just Run",1379462400,"09 18, 2013",2013,3735,"['plot', 'simple', 'meaning', 'just', 'as', 'simple', 'film', 'not', 'interesting', 'so', 'much', 'plot', 'high', 'level', 'human', 'contradictions', 'inhuman', 'bigotry', 'invested', 'sequence', 'it.A', 'young', 'brilliant', 'promising', 'lawyer', 'recruited', 'one', 'important', 'law', 'firm', 'Philadelphia', 'years', 'entrusted', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'cases', 'have', 'ever', 'had', 'hands', 'few', 'weeks', 'purely', 'simply', 'fired', 'incompetence', 'logic', 'extremely', 'fast', 'career', 'swiftness', 'broken', 'course', 'suspicious', 'lawyer', 'gay', 'aids.The', 'lawyer', 'court', 'lawyers', 'represent', 'refuse', 'including', 'friend', 'tenth', 'last', 'chance', 'how', 'America', 'was', 'late', '1980s', 'early', '1990s', 'Afraid', 'fundamentally', 'hostile', 'gay', 'people', 'name', 'anything', 'could', 'justify', 'bigotry', 'first', 'reading', 'Bible.The', 'tenth', 'lawyer', 'finally', 'represent', 'Federal', 'Vocational', 'Rehabilitation', 'Act', '1973', 'kind', 'discrimination', 'kind', 'handicap', 'provided', 'work', 'required', 'done', 'properly', 'find', 'jurisprudence', 'one', 'antecedent', 'case', 'court', 'accepted', 'consider', 'AIDS', 'being', 'such', 'physical', 'condition', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'handicap', 'thus', 'hostile', 'attitude', 'attitude', 'will', 'not', 'treat', 'such', 'person', 'other', 'discrimination.The', 'plot', 'simple', 'said', 'case', 'won', 'hefty', 'amount', 'damages', 'about', '5', 'millions.The', 'film', 'very', 'strong', 'lawyer', 'will', 'have', 'final', 'seizure', 'court', 'trial', 'will', 'go', 'come', 'end', 'absence', 'sentence', 'will', 'be', 'pronounced', 'being', 'still', 'alive', 'hospital', 'family', 'lawyer', 'friends', 'convened', 'room', 'celebrate', 'sentence', 'will', 'not', 'survive', 'evening', 'will', 'die', 'night', 'sole', 'presence', 'partner', 'court', 'decision', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'appealed', 'can', 'not', 'introduce', 'legal', 'suit', 'dead', 'person', 'trial', 'became', 'history', 'jurisprudence', 'common', 'law', 'call', 'it.The', 'acting', 'course', 'essential', 'true', 'times', 'situations', 'hatred', 'homophobic', 'people', 'make', 'acting', 'iffy', 'many', 'ways', 'skating', 'thin', 'ice', 'civil', 'war', 'would', 'like', 'start', 'exterminate', 'agents', 'devil', 'gay', 'people', 'are', 'accused', 'being', 'judge', 'end', 'trial', 'when', 'boss', 'law', 'firm', 'testifying', 'be', 'becoming', 'less', 'tolerant', 'antics', 'forces', 'boss', 'answer', 'very', 'embarrassing', 'questions', 'embarrassing', 'law', 'firm', 'course', 'treatment', 'lawyer', 'ten', 'ship', 'mates', 'when', 'was', 'navy', 'submitted', 'one', 'gay', 'sailor', 'Too', 'gross', 'even', 'quote', 'script.This', 'film', 'also', 'made', 'history', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'Public', 'opinion', 'USA', 'started', 'turn', 'period', 'strict', 'rejection', 'AIDS', 'gay', 'plague', 'hence', 'plagues', 'even', 'Moses', 'punishment', 'God', 'sin', 'case', 'homosexuals', 'starting', 'only', '1996', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'managed', 'get', 'Defense', 'Marriage', 'Act', 'DOMA', 'passed', 'Congress', 'One', 'most', 'vicious', 'pernicious', 'laws', 'gay', 'people.And', 'only', 'twenty', 'years', 'later', 'DOMA', 'was', 'finally', 'ruled', 'unconstitutional', 'federal', 'level', 'US', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'Twenty', 'long', 'years', 'legal', 'segregation', 'federal', 'level', 'only', 'thirteen', 'states', 'so', 'far', 'have', 'legalized', 'gay', 'marriage', 'road', 'still', 'long', 'even', 'thirteen', 'states', 'are', 'enough', 'block', 'possible', 'amendment', 'US', 'constitution', 'thirty-eight', 'states', 'be', 'ratified.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",N/A
9675,AL5OEDM8TPTKV,0767809270,James Hiller,"[3, 5]","Back in 1993, AIDS had been in the forefront of the news and everyone's minds for quite a while. Still, a major Hollywood movie still hadn't dealt with the subject matter. Sure we had some incredible films like ""Longtime Companion"" and the stunning ""Parting Glances"" (both which I highly recommend as truly visionary cinema), but they were more independent and not likely seen by mainstream audiences. Finally, with the foresight of Jonathan Demme, and the star power of Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington, Philadephia roared onto the screens and into our hearts. And now, finally, we have a DVD treatment that this movie truly deserves.Andrew Beckett, high priced lawyer of a top Pennsylvania law firm, suffers from AIDS quietly at the beginning of the film. A lesion betrays his secret quickly, leading to his dismissal. Firing back, Beckett attempts to secure the services of Joe Miller, a personal injury lawyer with an everyman reputation. At first rejecting his offer and even pouring salt in his wounds by mocking him, Miller is converted to the cause after witnessing subtle discrimination in a library. It is through Miller that everyone can approach this story, and it is through Beckett that we learn dignity and we learn pain.Much as been said about Tom Hanks' Academy Award winning performance as Beckett, and Denzel Washington's wonderful portrayal as Miller. Together, the two are an acting powerhouse, both equally dynamic and compelling in their characters. One can only wish they would team up again sometime in the future. At any rate, they are supported by a fine ensemble, starting with the late Jason Robards to the rarely seen and much missed Joanne Woodward, whose performance will reduce you to tears in seconds.Included in this DVD package are several documentaries detailing the development of the movie. The director's and writer's commentaries shed wonderful light into the process that went into making the movie. The few deleted scenes are wonderful to see, especially during a ""settlement"" negotiation between the parties. One very poignant thing mentioned in the documentary were the number of people suffering with AIDS that were employed in this movie, both in front of and behind the scenes. Very touching.But this isn't just a movie about AIDS. This is a movie that soars above the simple ""movie of the week"" syndrome, and dares to address such things as tolerance, acceptance, getting over your fears, and welcoming people for who they are.  It's amazing how relevant and meaningful those messages are today. In a climate of unacceptance and intolerance to others, hopefully Philadelphia's essential meanings will continue to ring as a bell of Liberty, and not just in the streets of the town of Brotherly Love.",5,On the streets of Philadelphia,1100304000,"11 13, 2004",2004,2746,"['Back', '1993', 'AIDS', 'had', 'been', 'forefront', 'news', 'everyone', 'minds', 'quite', 'while', 'Still', 'major', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'still', 'had', ""n't"", 'dealt', 'subject', 'matter', 'Sure', 'had', 'incredible', 'films', 'Longtime', 'Companion', 'stunning', 'Parting', 'Glances', 'highly', 'recommend', 'truly', 'visionary', 'cinema', 'were', 'more', 'independent', 'not', 'likely', 'seen', 'mainstream', 'audiences', 'Finally', 'foresight', 'Jonathan', 'Demme', 'star', 'power', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Philadephia', 'roared', 'screens', 'hearts', 'now', 'finally', 'have', 'DVD', 'treatment', 'movie', 'truly', 'deserves.Andrew', 'Beckett', 'high', 'priced', 'lawyer', 'top', 'Pennsylvania', 'law', 'firm', 'suffers', 'AIDS', 'quietly', 'beginning', 'film', 'lesion', 'secret', 'quickly', 'leading', 'dismissal', 'Firing', 'back', 'Beckett', 'secure', 'services', 'Joe', 'Miller', 'personal', 'injury', 'lawyer', 'everyman', 'reputation', 'first', 'rejecting', 'offer', 'even', 'pouring', 'salt', 'wounds', 'mocking', 'Miller', 'converted', 'cause', 'witnessing', 'subtle', 'discrimination', 'library', 'Miller', 'everyone', 'can', 'approach', 'story', 'Beckett', 'learn', 'dignity', 'learn', 'pain.Much', 'been', 'said', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winning', 'performance', 'Beckett', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'wonderful', 'portrayal', 'Miller', 'Together', 'two', 'are', 'acting', 'powerhouse', 'equally', 'dynamic', 'compelling', 'characters', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'wish', 'would', 'team', 'up', 'again', 'sometime', 'future', 'rate', 'are', 'supported', 'fine', 'ensemble', 'starting', 'late', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'rarely', 'seen', 'much', 'missed', 'Joanne', 'Woodward', 'performance', 'will', 'reduce', 'tears', 'seconds.Included', 'DVD', 'package', 'are', 'several', 'documentaries', 'detailing', 'development', 'movie', 'director', 'writer', 'commentaries', 'shed', 'wonderful', 'light', 'process', 'went', 'making', 'movie', 'few', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'wonderful', 'see', 'especially', 'settlement', 'negotiation', 'parties', 'One', 'very', 'poignant', 'thing', 'mentioned', 'documentary', 'were', 'number', 'people', 'suffering', 'AIDS', 'were', 'employed', 'movie', 'front', 'scenes', 'Very', 'touching.But', ""n't"", 'just', 'movie', 'AIDS', 'movie', 'simple', 'movie', 'week', 'syndrome', 'address', 'such', 'things', 'tolerance', 'acceptance', 'getting', 'fears', 'welcoming', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'amazing', 'how', 'relevant', 'meaningful', 'messages', 'are', 'today', 'climate', 'unacceptance', 'intolerance', 'others', 'hopefully', 'Philadelphia', 'essential', 'meanings', 'will', 'continue', 'ring', 'bell', 'Liberty', 'not', 'just', 'streets', 'town', 'Brotherly', 'Love']",N/A
9676,AQQFI7YHMRL7S,0767809270,James Morris,"[44, 47]","I purchase a lot of DVDs.  For the past few years, it seems that almost every DVD comes in a special edition two-disc release that includes deleted scenes, documentaries, cast bios, trailers, teaser trailers, music videos, and the director's recipe for three-alarm chili.  I usually don't have time to get beyond the first disc, and much of what I do get around to usually turns out to be as boring as it gets.  This time, however, I am happy to report that the two-disc anniversary release of Philadelphia is worth both the money and the time invested in it, even if you already have Philadelphia on DVD.The special features include the 84-minute documentary, One Foot On A Banana Peel and the Other In the Grave, an extraordinary piece of amateur filmmaking by an AIDS patient named Juan Botas.  What I did not know was that Mr. Botas' AIDS diagnosis provided the inspiration for director Jonathan Demme to make Philadelphia in the first place, as Mr. Botas was best friends with Mr. Demme's wife.  In the meanwhile, Mr. Botas mentioned to filmmaker Demme that it was a shame that the black humor, amazing courage and other interesting dialogue that emanated from his fellow patients at the clinic where he was being treated was being lost forever as it left their lips.  Mr. Demme gave Mr. Botas his hand-held camera, and the results so impressed Demme that he wound up releasing the documentary through his own production company.  The finished film is touching, oddly comic, tragic and as effecting as any piece of drama you've ever witnessed.  One of the patients from the doctor's office was also given a few lines in the main feature, Philadelphia.Which brings us to that film.  At the time of its release, Philadelphia received some very harsh criticism from the AIDS community for its perceived flaws; it was judged by many as ""too Hollywood"" to be realistically representative of the HIV / AIDS experience.  To their credit, in the background documentary included here, ""People Like Us"" (which was the original working title of Philadelphia) the creative team behind Philadelphia (including Jonathan Demme, Tom Hanks and the screenwriter Ron Nyswaner) meet this criticism head on, presenting a defense of their work that is both credible and illuminating.  Many complained that Philadelphia was void of any tenderness or physical contact between the male couple (Hanks and Bandaras) but this is not only redressed by a closer look at their scenes together, an extremely intimate scene between the lovers in bed (which was excised from the final cut) was deleted not for its controversy but because the scene simply didn't work (having now seen it, I can attest to this fact).  I have long seen this movie as not a film about AIDS per se, but as a film about homophobia.  Indeed, the main thrust of the plot (besides the trial) is the transformation of the character of Joe Miller from committed homophobe to a more enlightened and tolerant person.  One of my favorite scenes (which it turns out many people wanted to delete from the final cut) deals subtly with Millers transformation - the ""opera scene"".In that scene, Miller is asked by the character or Andy what he thinks about gay people.  The attorney responds that, when straight people think of them at all, most straight people pretty much see all gay people as some sort of sub-human predatory monsters, out to ensnare the children of the world into a twisted sick life, and destroy all that straight people hold dear.  Andy abruptly changes the subject, ""Do you like opera, Joe?"" he asks.  Caught by surprise, Joe admits he does not know anything about it  - and Andy Beckett - this sub-human destroyer of children, responds by tenderly and passionately explaining his deep love for beautiful music by allowing Joe to see just a small piece of exactly why so many gay men love opera.  He plays the aria La Mama Morte, carefully, passionately and articulately explaining the story and the beauty behind the words and music.  Joe is immediately transformed - it's clear that he is deeply moved.  By playing the piece, La Mama Morte through again in its entirety, the screenwriter and director shows us that the music has stayed with Joe long after he's left Andy's home.  We see him leave Andy's apartment and go home in a sort of daze, kiss his sleeping baby and slip into bed with his slumbering wife, while the beauty of the music haunts and caresses him, like a gorgeous gay lullaby.  Some of my gay friends were among those who didn't get this scene - they saw it only as a stereotypical depiction of a gay man's love for opera.  I got it right away - by exposing Joe to a thing of beauty he'd never experienced before, Andy had suddenly allowed Joe to consider that gay men were not only something more than what he thought, he demonstrated that we are capable of enormous passion and the ability to appreciate delicate beauty.  This scene, more than any other, allowed Andrew Beckett to be transformed from a predatory sub-human freak into a human being, not only for Joe Miller, but for many in the straight audience.  It has remained one of my favorite scenes in a movie ever, and a small part of what makes Philadelphia such a powerful experience.Highly recommended.",5,As Powerful As Ever,1148601600,"05 26,

9677,A3KY68OTSNHM3G,0767809270,Jeffrey T. Munson,"[3, 3]","Tom Hanks stars in this provocative drama about a lawyer who is dismissed from his high-profile law firm under suspicious circumstances.  Hanks stars as Andrew Beckett, a highly successful lawyer in a prominent Philadelphia law firm headed by Charles Wheeler (Jason Robards).  Andrew is given a very lucrative account to handle, but his paperwork for the case mysteriously disappears moments before the case is to begin, and to make matters worse, the Statute of Limitations is about to run out.  Fortunately, the paperwork is found in time, but Andrew, as a result of this mishap,  ends up falling out of favor with his senior partners, but is there more than meets the eye?Andrew is dismissed by his firm for nearly fouling up the case, but Andrew beleives that there are other reasons for his firing, so he decides to fight his dismissal in court.  He seeks the help of attorney Joe Miller, played magnificently by Denzel Washington.  Unknown to the conservative Miller, Andrew is infected with the AIDS virus.  Andrew believes that this is the real reason that he was fired, not the botched legal case.  However, Miller is very reluctant to help Andrew.  Miller fits the classic ""homophobic"" stereotype; all homosexuals are ""bad"", they should be locked up, etc.  Undeterred, Andrew decides to fight his case on his own.One night while studying at a local law library, Andrew and Joe meet up once again.  The two begin to talk, and Joe begins to ask questions about Andrew's case.  After much consideration, Joe decides to represent Andrew, and, as the movie goes along, a very strong friendship develops between the two.  Despite their friendship, will Joe be able to help Andrew win his lawsuit, or will the large firm and their high profile and high-priced lawyers win in the end?This is an excellent movie.  I'm a big Tom Hanks fan, and I've seen many of his other films (""Saving Private Ryan, ""Apollo 13"", etc), but he gives his best dramatic performance in ""Philadelphia"".  Watching the way that the AIDS virus progresses during the course of the movie is very dramatic and very effective.  The scene where Andrew raises his shirt in the courtroom to expose the leisions on his chest is especially dramatic.  The medical aspects of the disease are handled well throughout the film.  Andrew's fall in the courtroom is extremely gripping to see.Denzel Washington's character of Joe Miller deserves as much praise as Hanks' charater of Andrew.  Washington does an excellent job of playing a homophobic person confronted with the responsibility of defending a homosexual.  It's enlightening to watch Joe's transformation from homophobe in the beginning of the film to trusted friend and colleague at the end.  His courtroom scenes and examination of witnesses are high points of the movie.The supporting actors (Jason Robards as Charles Wheeler and Antonio Banderas as Miguel) give powerful performances as well.  I especially liked Robards.  He did a fantastic job of portraying the prototypical ""tough and by the book"" lawyer.  In the end, however, it was his close-mindedness that was his downfall.I give this movie my highest recommendation.  The acting and story is first-rate and the message is very powerful; friendship and belief in what you are doing can overcome any obstacle.",5,A Powerful and Moving Film,1108512000,"02 16, 2005",2005,3291,"['Tom', 'Hanks', 'provocative', 'drama', 'lawyer', 'who', 'dismissed', 'high-profile', 'law', 'firm', 'suspicious', 'circumstances', 'Hanks', 'Andrew', 'Beckett', 'highly', 'successful', 'lawyer', 'prominent', 'Philadelphia', 'law', 'firm', 'headed', 'Charles', 'Wheeler', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'Andrew', 'given', 'very', 'lucrative', 'account', 'handle', 'paperwork', 'case', 'mysteriously', 'moments', 'case', 'begin', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'Statute', 'Limitations', 'run', 'out', 'Fortunately', 'paperwork', 'found', 'time', 'Andrew', 'result', 'mishap', 'up', 'falling', 'favor', 'senior', 'partners', 'there', 'more', 'eye', 'Andrew', 'dismissed', 'firm', 'nearly', 'fouling', 'up', 'case', 'Andrew', 'are', 'other', 'reasons', 'firing', 'fight', 'dismissal', 'court', 'help', 'attorney', 'Joe', 'Miller', 'played', 'magnificently', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Unknown', 'conservative', 'Miller', 'Andrew', 'infected', 'AIDS', 'virus', 'Andrew', 'real', 'reason', 'was', 'fired', 'not', 'botched', 'legal', 'case', 'However', 'Miller', 'very', 'reluctant', 'help', 'Andrew', 'Miller', 'classic', 'homophobic', 'stereotype', 'homosexuals', 'are', 'bad', 'should', 'be', 'locked', 'up', 'etc', 'Undeterred', 'Andrew', 'fight', 'case', 'own.One', 'night', 'studying', 'local', 'law', 'library', 'Andrew', 'Joe', 'meet', 'up', 'once', 'again', 'two', 'begin', 'talk', 'Joe', 'ask', 'questions', 'Andrew', 'case', 'much', 'consideration', 'Joe', 'represent', 'Andrew', 'movie', 'along', 'very', 'strong', 'friendship', 'two', 'friendship', 'will', 'Joe', 'be', 'able', 'help', 'Andrew', 'win', 'lawsuit', 'will', 'large', 'firm', 'high', 'profile', 'high-priced', 'lawyers', 'win', 'end', 'excellent', 'movie', ""'m"", 'big', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'fan', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'Apollo', '13', 'etc', 'best', 'dramatic', 'performance', 'Philadelphia', 'Watching', 'way', 'AIDS', 'virus', 'course', 'movie', 'very', 'dramatic', 'very', 'effective', 'scene', 'where', 'Andrew', 'shirt', 'courtroom', 'expose', 'leisions', 'chest', 'especially', 'dramatic', 'medical', 'aspects', 'disease', 'are', 'handled', 'well', 'film', 'Andrew', 'fall', 'courtroom', 'extremely', 'gripping', 'see.Denzel', 'Washington', 'character', 'Joe', 'Miller', 'as', 'much', 'praise', 'Hanks', 'charater', 'Andrew', 'Washington', 'excellent', 'job', 'playing', 'homophobic', 'person', 'confronted', 'responsibility', 'defending', 'homosexual', 'enlightening', 'watch', 'Joe', 'transformation', 'homophobe', 'beginning', 'film', 'trusted', 'friend', 'colleague', 'end', 'courtroom', 'scenes', 'examination', 'witnesses', 'are', 'high', 'points', 'movie.The', 'supporting', 'actors', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'Charles', 'Wheeler', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'Miguel', 'give', 'powerful', 'performances', 'as', 'well', 'especially', 'liked', 'Robards', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'portraying', 'prototypical', 'tough', 'book', 'lawyer', 'end', 'however', 'was', 'close-mindedness', 'was', 'downfall.I', 'give', 'movie', 'highest', 'recommendation', 'acting', 'story', 'first-rate', 'message', 'very', 'powerful', 'friendship', 'belief', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'can', 'overcome', 'obstacle']",N/A
9678,A1ARZLZRS4JZX7,0767809270,Jerry Call,"[22, 61]","""Philadelphia"" is Hollywood's pathetic, hygienic attempt to deal with the maelstrom of controversy surrounding AIDS. It just doesn't want to offend anyone. (Even the Talking Heads's song ""Heaven,"" heard in one scene, has its ""heaven is a place where nothing ever happens"" lyric rendered not so offensive.) The performances of Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington are noteworthy, but the film refuses to fully explore how AIDS can lay waste to a person's body, mind, and relationships. Does our main character's family and friends struggle with an admixture of hatred, disgust, pity, and sorrow for their infected son? Of course not! That would be too real for the suburban megaplex crowd and for the gay community. No, in ""Philadelphia,"" the AIDS victim's family and friends are supportive until the end. Who's the bad guy?

Tom Hanks plays a gay  man who for a brief, sad time in his life was sexually promiscuous.  He  caught AIDS.His character doesn't work--he is a stereotype, or,  rather, what the filmmakers would *like* to be a stereotype, I think:  the  sensitive, intelligent, put-upon Gay Man.  His employers, who fire him  immediately upon finding out he is gay and has AIDS, are stereotypical  Villains.

They are the Cold-Hearted Homophobes.Denzel  Washington is Hanks' lawyer, the Homophone-Who-Becomes-More-Human by  knowing the Gay Man.Sound puerile?  It is.

As of now, with the exception of some independent films as well as some programs on television, it is the only one I know of.  I don't know how it did at the box office but it did win a lot of awards and recognition, especially for Tom Hanks, who won an Academy Award for best actor.Cast in the role of a lawyer in a prestigious Philadelphia law firm who is fired because he has AIDS, Hanks really took on the role wholeheartedly.  He must have dieted to starvation because his weight loss is quite noticeable and with the aid of good makeup, we see his physical appearance change before our eyes.  Denzel Washington is cast as a lawyer too, but he works independently, taking on small cases of personal injury, even advertising his services on television.  He's happily married with a wife and small baby and hates homosexuals.  However, in spite of his feelings, he takes on Hanks' case, never completely giving up his negative feelings towards gays, but yet understanding his client's very human feelings about wanting to live.Joanne Woodward is cast as Hanks' mother and, even though her role is small, there are some very moving moments between them. Jason Robards is the partner in the law firm who expresses disgust at the fact that Hanks had the nerve to bring AIDS right into their office.  Mary Steenburgen is the attorney for the law firm and she does an excellent job of very clearly bringing out some of the legal issues.  And Antonio Bandaras is cast as Hanks' partner who has the unpleasant tasks of helping Hanks with his treatments.  The whole cast does an excellent job.  Every person seemed absolutely real under Jonathan Demme's very capable direction.Mostly the film involved itself with the legal issues and this kept it from being maudlin.

Director Jonathan Demme has assembled a cast to die for and with an intelligent, provocative, and thoughtful script, he has given us one of the best ""message"" films ever committed to celluloid.  Whether or not you are heterosexual, homosexual, a gay rights activist or an out and out homophobe, you can't help but be impacted by the power of this movie.Of course, Tom Hanks shines in a brave role, a risky role that Hanks elevates to heights of greatness.  Hanks has given us so many outstanding performances through his career:  Big; Saving Private Ryan; Cast Away; Forest Gump; Apollo 13; Road to Perdition; Green Mile; etc., etc.  Tom has the ability to not only portray a character, but to inhabit him as well.  Tom's soliloquy while listening to the beautiful piece by Maria Callas is devastating; his faltering moments in the courtroom are heartwrenchingly real.  It is truly an Oscar worthy performance.  Equally impressive is Oscar winner Denzel Washington, crimefully neglected at Oscar time for this one; I think it's Denzel's most powerful and controlled performance.  Initially a diehard homophobe, he is able to arrest these reservations and work hard to help Hanks win his case.  His reactions during the aforementioned Hanks soliloquy prove how good actors don't need to say a word to show what they're feeling.  And what a marvelous supporting cast:  Joanne Woodward is superb in her small but wonderful performance as Hanks' mother; Antonio Banderas, eschewing his pretty boy persona with a direct and honest portrayal of Hanks' lover; Jason Robards hiding behind his own homophobia and judgmental religious fervor; Kathryn Witt in her small role as the aids-infected lady who wasn't fired because it wasn't her fault she had AIDs.  The entire cast down to the smallest of roles is mesmerizing.  The actors playing Tom's family are marvelous.  The musical score by Howard Shore, and the Oscar winning title song by Bruce Springsteen complement the movie tremendously.PHILADELPHIA is one powerful movie; one that will make you examine your own prejudices; Hanks was really being tried for his lifestyle; his final scenes with his family and especially Banderas are beautifully done, and the movie proves what a remarkable actor we have in both Hanks and Washington.

It's not a bad movie, but I didn't think it was so great.The movie had good believable acting from Hanks and Denzel Washington, but the part the movie fails in is the TELLING of the story. There's just too many courtroom scenes and not enough character development, and without that, it gets pretty boring and repetitive. You can't give the movie credit for the story it's TRYING to tell, because as far as I'm concerned, the story it DID tell was not told in an entertaining way.The two main characters weren't developed enough. For one, the transformation of Denzel's feelings about gay people was not believable, there just wasn't enough shown on screen to make the viewer believe that he would have any reason to change his feelings. The way it was directed, it looked as if that opera scene is what changed Denzel's feelings about Hanks, and that's ridiculous to have someone's lifelong feelings that has been etched into their persona be changed almost because of a single incident (like I said, the way it was directed implied this).

9712,A2VK365XEVCYC8,0767809270,One More Option,"[4, 5]","If you are reading this review, you may have one of these 3 questions:1) Are the extras on this DVD worthwhile?  Yes, the documentaries not only remind us of the cultural mindsets that were dominant in the 1980s, but they also remind us of the sea change force this movie had on U.S. culture.  The two main documentaries are exceptional and Springstein's video reminds us why we listen intently to whatever Springstein has to say.2) Was Tom Hanks' performance worthy of the Oscar?  Watch the movie and decide for yourself.  Tom Hanks' understanding of pathos is lightning in a bottle.  It is uniquely gifted.  From the scenes talking to his mother on the phone, to defending his gay lover who's being threatened to be expelled from his hospital room, to his efforts to seek some basic human recognition (or call it justice) as his body is rapidly dying.3) Is the movie worth watching again or for the first time?  Yes, it is a well crafted movie.  Jonathan Demme's direction is superb, coming off his Best Director Oscar for Silence of the Lambs, he chose this project and he is in full form.  The movie moves quickly, with the pace of a thriller.  The story had universal morals that, before this film's release, had not been so well presented to such a mass audience.  Watching the acting performances gives a remarkable master class in understanding vocal demeanors, non-verbal cues, and concise word selection.The title of this review is a question asked to Tom Hanks' character as he is on the witness stand, defending himself while he knows he likely only has a few days left to live.  His response to the question is this:""I . . . many things . . . uh, what I love most about the law?  . . . Is that every now and again, not often . . . but occasionally you get to be a part of justice being done.  That really is quite a thrill when that happens.""This movie was also a part of justice being done.  It effectively helped change popular perceptions about AIDS & homosexuality.  It did more good than 100 winning court cases.  It disarmed so much stupid discrimination.Before this movie, as is quoted in the film, the following was true: ""Subsequent decisions have held that AIDS is protected as a handicap under the law, not only because of the physical limitations it imposes, but because the prejudice surrounding AIDS exacts a social death which precedes . . . which precedes the actual physical one.""After this movie, social perceptions about AIDS and the treatment of people with AIDS greatly improved, due in part to the artfulness and clarity of ideas beautifully expressed in this film.What do I love about the arts?  They have the ability to make practical, widespread cultural perceptual changes, changes that are more quickly and effectively enabled when the arts are allowed to be expressive and prominent.",5,"""What do you love about the law Andrew?""",1177027200,"04 20, 2007",2007,2824,"['are', 'reading', 'review', 'may', 'have', 'one', '3', 'questions:1', 'Are', 'extras', 'DVD', 'worthwhile', 'Yes', 'documentaries', 'not', 'only', 'remind', 'cultural', 'mindsets', 'were', 'dominant', '1980s', 'also', 'remind', 'sea', 'change', 'force', 'movie', 'had', 'U.S.', 'culture', 'two', 'main', 'documentaries', 'are', 'exceptional', 'Springstein', 'video', 'why', 'listen', 'intently', 'whatever', 'Springstein', 'say.2', 'Was', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'performance', 'worthy', 'Oscar', 'Watch', 'movie', 'decide', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'understanding', 'pathos', 'lightning', 'bottle', 'uniquely', 'gifted', 'scenes', 'talking', 'mother', 'phone', 'defending', 'gay', 'lover', 'who', 'being', 'threatened', 'be', 'expelled', 'hospital', 'room', 'efforts', 'seek', 'basic', 'human', 'recognition', 'call', 'justice', 'body', 'rapidly', 'dying.3', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'again', 'first', 'time', 'Yes', 'well', 'crafted', 'movie', 'Jonathan', 'Demme', 'direction', 'superb', 'coming', 'off', 'Best', 'Director', 'Oscar', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'chose', 'project', 'full', 'form', 'movie', 'quickly', 'pace', 'thriller', 'story', 'had', 'universal', 'morals', 'film', 'release', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'so', 'well', 'presented', 'such', 'mass', 'audience', 'Watching', 'acting', 'remarkable', 'master', 'class', 'understanding', 'vocal', 'demeanors', 'non-verbal', 'cues', 'concise', 'word', 'selection.The', 'title', 'review', 'question', 'asked', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'character', 'witness', 'stand', 'defending', 'likely', 'only', 'few', 'days', 'left', 'live', 'response', 'question', 'many', 'things', 'uh', 'what', 'love', 'most', 'law', 'now', 'again', 'not', 'often', 'occasionally', 'get', 'be', 'part', 'justice', 'being', 'done', 'really', 'quite', 'thrill', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'also', 'part', 'justice', 'being', 'done', 'effectively', 'helped', 'change', 'popular', 'perceptions', 'AIDS', 'homosexuality', 'did', 'more', 'good', '100', 'winning', 'court', 'cases', 'disarmed', 'so', 'much', 'stupid', 'discrimination.Before', 'movie', 'quoted', 'film', 'following', 'was', 'true', 'Subsequent', 'decisions', 'have', 'held', 'AIDS', 'protected', 'handicap', 'law', 'not', 'only', 'physical', 'limitations', 'prejudice', 'surrounding', 'AIDS', 'social', 'death', 'actual', 'physical', 'one', 'movie', 'social', 'perceptions', 'AIDS', 'treatment', 'people', 'AIDS', 'greatly', 'improved', 'due', 'part', 'artfulness', 'clarity', 'ideas', 'beautifully', 'expressed', 'do', 'love', 'arts', 'have', 'ability', 'make', 'practical', 'widespread', 'cultural', 'perceptual', 'changes', 'changes', 'are', 'more', 'quickly', 'effectively', 'enabled', 'when', 'arts', 'are', 'allowed', 'be', 'expressive', 'prominent']",N/A

Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington star in this gripping film that shows us what it was like for people afflicted by these life-altering diseases in a time not so long ago.  Andrew Beckett, played by Tom Hanks and loosely based on real-life attorneys Geoffrey Bowers and Clarence B. Cain, is a skilled, well-liked, and highly-respected attorney in Philadelphia...that is, until he is suddenly fired after crucial paperwork for a big case he'd been working on inexplicably disappears.  Sure that his bosses have discovered that he is gay and has AIDS and fired him accordingly, Beckett seeks to sue his former firm for discrimination and wrongful termination, doing so in a time when ADIS-discrimination cases were practically unheard of.  Along those same lines, this movie is one of the first mainstream Hollywood films to acknowledge HIV/AIDS, homosexuality, and homophobia.  Beckett is ultimately represented in his suit by Joe Miller, played by Denzel Washington, and the two set out to prove their case while in the heat of public debate on the issue.  This film does pretty much everything right.  No, seriously, I can find no flaws.  The plot is interesting, the acting is top-notch, and I'm glued to my screen from beginning to end.  Hanks and Washington work well together, especially given that one of them is homophobic himself and knows very little about AIDS and how the disease is transmitted...this character's internal conflicts on the matter only strengthen the unusual bond that these actors share on screen, even if Washington, who was asked to gain weight for his role, would taunt Hanks, who was asked to lose weight for his role, with food while on the set.  If any, I have only two minor complaints about this movie.  The First is one that people have stated before:  I would have liked to see more of Andrew Beckett's relationship with his lover, Miguel &Aacute;lvarez, played by Antonio Banderas.  Mr. Banderas definitely didn't get enough screen time, given the role he played in the main character's life.  Second, why did Denzel Washington not get nominated for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar?  He would have had a real shot at winning it.  And for me, that's saying something given that Tommy Lee Jones won that award that year for his role as U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard in my favorite movie of all time, The Fugitive.  Nevertheless, this is a film that no one should go without seeing.  I absolutely recommend it!

9716,A1GN8UJIZLCA59,0767809270,P Magnum,"[4, 4]","Philadelphia was Jonathan Demme's follow up to Silence Of The Lambs.  Doing a 180 degree turn in stories, Philadelphia is basically a courtroom drama with Andrew Beckett, who is a gay man with the AIDS virus, suing his former employer, Wexler, Wheeler, a large, powerful and influential Philadelphia law firm, for wrongful termination based on discrimination due to his medical condition. Andy is an up and coming lawyer who is given a big and important case.  At a meeting with the partners, one of them notices a lesion on his head, but Andy makes a story up about it.  Andy works on the case while having some complications from his sickness.  He completes the work, but at the eleventh hour, the case is mysteriously lost and all records are lost.  The files are found, but Andy is terminated supposedly for incompetence and a bad attitude.  Andy decides to sue, but is turned down by many law firms, including Joe Miller who is an ambulance chaser with over the top TV ads, as they are afraid of the case.  Andy decides to represent himself, but when Joe, who is black, sees the treatment Andy receives at a law library, he agrees to represent him.  Joe has prejudices of his own as he hates homosexuals, but he believes Andy's rights have been violated.  Tom Hanks is absolutely stunning as Andy.  We see him slowly succumb to his disease and his transformation is startling.  He depicts Andy with grace and avoids any stereotypical characterizations.  Denzel Washington is equally amazing as Joe Miller.  He plays the role with the right amount of force, but peels back the layers to show an understanding side.  Joe is a blowhard and hardheaded, but in the end shows compassion.  Jason Robards is commanding as Mr. Wheeler, the bigwig at the law firm and Joanne Woodward plays Andy's mother with class. Mr. Demme gives a real feel for the city of Philadelphia. The movie was the first mainstream Hollywood film to make the subject of AIDS its main plotline.  The film walks a fineline and avoids becoming too preachy. Mr. Hanks deservedly won his first of his two consecutive Best Actor Oscars, but Mr. Washington was every bit his equal.

But it is also one of the most touching and beautiful films ever made. Few can sit through it without shedding at least a few tears. But more importantly, few can sit through it without experiencing enlightenment and inner change. This makes Philadelphia an incredibly important film that everyone should see at least once. It has the power to touch even the most bigoted anti-homosexual souls in this world. The film is also a meticulous masterpiece, and few can argue the claim. The acting by every single person in this film is impeccable. Central characters as well as those playing smaller roles bring honest realism, as well as truth and humanity to their characters. Jonathan Demme honestly and tenderly tells the story of one human being stricken with aids, and the suffering it inflicts, and the way it effects family and friends. Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington deliver powerful and unforgettable performances that are not only good, but are truly astonishing in every possible aspect. Philadelphia is no ordinary movie. It is a life affirming film that has the power to change the way the world see's, accepts and understands those stricken with the AIDS virus.

With all due respect to all the male AIDS victims when this film was cast, none of them could have achieved what Tom Hanks did in the role of Andrew Beckett. I presume to suggest, therefore, that this is a work of art which addresses truly serious issues which include but are not limited to AIDS within our society.That said, the basic plot focuses on Beckett's wrongful termination by his law firm employer after its managing partner Charles Wheeler (Jason Robards, Jr.) and his senior associates learn that Beckett has AIDS. (He had not previously informed them.) He is represented in court by Joe Miller (Denzel Washington) who runs a highly-visible, high-volume firm which specializes in representation of individuals seeking damages such as those which result from automobile injuries. Miller is a homophobic when he first meets Beckett (who seeks him out) and declines to represent him. Later, he changes his mind for reasons which are best revealed in the film. All of the acting is first-rate. The film's dramatic impact is largely explained by the fact that Demme (with strong support by Hanks) was determined to treat an immensely complicated and sensitive situation with appropriate style, grace, taste, and respect. He and his associates succeeded.Hanks received and deserved an Academy Award for best actor. My own opinion is that Neil Young deserved the Academy Award for best song which was awarded to Bruce Springsteen. Better yet, they should have called it a tie. Both deserved it. Given all the copy cat and sappy ""music"" which is composed for most films, Young's ""Philadelphia"" and Springsteen's ""Streets of Philadelphia""  are not only uniquely powerful but enduringly haunting. My favorite scene is the last one which allows extended emotional involvement of the audience. No dialogue. No theatrics. Given how Andy Beckett's personality and character are presented in the film, this is precisely the way he would want his story to end.",5,"Ah Andrew, Ah humanity!",1066694400,"10 21, 2003",2003,2279,"['praise', 'film', 'received', 'receive', 'well-deserved', 'seeing', 'again', 'recently', 'however', 'now', 'think', 'film', 'social', 'issues', 'have', 'become', 'minds', 'many', 'people', 'more', 'important', 'artistic', 'issues', 'whereas', 'see', 'being', 'equal', 'inseparable', 'importance', 'due', 'respect', 'male', 'AIDS', 'victims', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'cast', 'none', 'could', 'have', 'achieved', 'what', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'did', 'role', 'Andrew', 'Beckett', 'presume', 'suggest', 'therefore', 'work', 'art', 'truly', 'serious', 'issues', 'include', 'are', 'not', 'limited', 'AIDS', 'society.That', 'said', 'basic', 'plot', 'focuses', 'Beckett', 'wrongful', 'termination', 'law', 'firm', 'employer', 'managing', 'partner', 'Charles', 'Wheeler', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'Jr.', 'senior', 'associates', 'learn', 'Beckett', 'AIDS', 'had', 'not', 'previously', 'informed', 'represented', 'court', 'Joe', 'Miller', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'who', 'highly-visible', 'high-volume', 'firm', 'representation', 'individuals', 'seeking', 'damages', 'such', 'result', 'automobile', 'injuries', 'Miller', 'homophobic', 'when', 'first', 'Beckett', 'who', 'out', 'represent', 'Later', 'mind', 'reasons', 'are', 'best', 'revealed', 'film', 'acting', 'first-rate', 'film', 'dramatic', 'impact', 'largely', 'explained', 'fact', 'Demme', 'strong', 'support', 'Hanks', 'was', 'determined', 'treat', 'immensely', 'complicated', 'sensitive', 'situation', 'appropriate', 'style', 'grace', 'taste', 'respect', 'associates', 'succeeded.Hanks', 'received', 'deserved', 'Academy', 'Award', 'best', 'actor', 'own', 'opinion', 'Neil', 'Young', 'deserved', 'Academy', 'Award', 'best', 'song', 'was', 'awarded', 'Bruce', 'Springsteen', 'Better', 'yet', 'should', 'have', 'called', 'tie', 'deserved', 'Given', 'copy', 'cat', 'sappy', 'music', 'composed', 'most', 'films', 'Young', 'Philadelphia', 'Springsteen', 'Streets', 'Philadelphia', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'uniquely', 'powerful', 'enduringly', 'haunting', 'favorite', 'scene', 'last', 'one', 'extended', 'emotional', 'involvement', 'audience', 'dialogue', 'theatrics', 'Given', 'how', 'Andy', 'Beckett', 'personality', 'character', 'are', 'presented', 'film', 'precisely', 'way', 'would', 'want', 'story', 'end']",N/A

9727,A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB,0767809270,"Sarah ""Eat Dessert First""","[6, 7]","For any of you Rentheads out there, yes, the title of my Philadelphia review is from the musical Rent, more specifically the song &quot;Seasons of Love.&quot; I saw the musical Rent before I saw Philadelphia and some of the same basic human emotions and reactions regarding AIDS, homosexuality and mortality that are in RENT apply equally well to Philadelphia. &quot;Philadelphia&quot; follows the journey of lawyer Andrew Beckett as he sues his firm for firing him on the grounds of discrimination. The catch: Beckett is gay and is in the final stages of AIDS.We see Beckett as a capable lawyer, compassionate, determined to make a change in the world. He hides the telltale KS (Kaposi's Sarcoma) lesions on his face from his coworkers with makeup but he is noticeably thin and fatigued. Suffering from severe chronic diarrhea as a result of KS and AZT, he is taken to the hospital where we first meet his longtime companion Miguel (Antonio Banderas), a rather headstrong yet tender lover who is fiercely devoted to Andy. Later we meet Joe Miller, the lawyer that we first see Andy arguing a case against in the beginning of the film. Miller is a stereotypical &quot;ambulance chaser&quot; with the prerequisite cheesy TV ads. He is also an extreme homophobe and is fearful of HIV. Throughout the film Joe Miller learns to accept Andy for the goodhearted, decent person that he is and the fragility of all life. He does not agree with Andy's lifestyle but does not want to abandon him, knowing that in his condition Andy could never defend himself.The months pass quickly, and Andy's deterioration is frighteningly rapid. His hair thins and turns grey, he requires blood transfusions, he is gaunt and grey and suffers from frequent respiratory infections. He knows that he will die soon and tries to face death with dignity, echoing the lyrics from the RENT song &quot;Will I?&quot;: 'Will I lose my dignity Will someone care Will I wake tomorrow From this nightmare?' Andy's fears and his love for life are beautifully expressed during a monologue set to the aria &quot;La Momma Morta&quot; performed by Maria Callas. Miguel wants Andy to start writing a will and planning for his memorial, but instead Andy throws a &quot;celebration of life&quot; party for himself and his friends (mostly homosexuals with the exception of Joe Miller and his wife. Joe handles the occasion beautifully considering his intensive dislike of homosexuality).Andy is attacked from within and without: AIDS ravages his body while lawyer Belinda Conine (Mary Steenburgen) tries to rip apart his credibility and personal life on the witness stand and in the court. Andy is made to confess his past mistakes that have ultimately and unknowingly cost him his career and his life: his past visits to a gay pornography theatre, at least one anonymous sexual encounter at said theatre (interestingly enough this occurred 10 years earlier when he was still with Miguel, yet Miguel was not infected, suggesting that this act was a momentary lapse in judgment rather than an habitual act). This admittance to Andy's having sex with a stranger and contracting AIDS is used against him, showing that he was a threat and could have infected Miguel and other partners with AIDS. Miguel watches, tortured, from the bench. Andy is increasingly ill and frail in the courtroom and eventually collapses. Inevitably Andy dies in hospital with Miguel at his side.Antonio Banderas is absolutely amazing in his role as Miguel--the slow dance with Andy at the party, the arguments at home, the anguish and tenderness in his eyes as he kisses Andy's fingers, the only part of him not tubed, as Andy is dying. His eyes reflect so much love for Andy, fear of losing him, pain at seeing the agony he lives through every day with AIDS. He has been with him for a decade, and suddenly mundane moments take on new meaning as there will not be others to follow. He too must face Andy's mortality, and he appears outwardly gruff and argumentative. He must appear courageous for Andy's sake and his own or he would become lost in his grief.In my opinion this is the definitive role of Tom Hanks' lifetime. Andy is an ordinary man: a devoted lover, a decent, honest person, and an outstanding lawyer. He tries to do what is right, what he believes in, to be proud of himself and his accomplishments. Tom Hanks brings a wisdom and tenderness to the role that makes him ultimately believable and not just a victim. Just a glance from Hanks, a word, a gesture, conveys more about Andy than pages of dialogue ever could. The loving glances between Miguel and Andy and Andy and his family, his look of hopelessness as he stands on the street after being refused by Joe Miller, his face as he is on trial, sick and alone and having to defend his actions from the past. He faces injustice and loss with courage. Tom Hanks becomes Andy, going through a physical and spiritual transformation that touches our souls.This movie does an excellent job of covering both the treatment of homosexuality and the AIDS epidemic in the U.S. during the early 1990's. Because it is a mainstream film it shies away from certain elements, mainly more physical contact and scenes between Miguel and Andy, and focuses more on Joe Miller's gradual acceptance of AIDS and Andy's homosexuality. There are many scenes involving fear and hatred directed at homosexuals and offensive language and jokes. But &quot;Philadelphia&quot; has something meaningful to say about the power of love and support in times of need, about understanding and being tolerant of alternative lifestyles, and about accepting the inevitability of death with grace and courage. An excellent film, touching and thought-provoking.",5,How do you measure a year in the life?,998956800,"08 28, 2001",2001,5720,"['Rentheads', 'there', 'yes', 'title', 'Philadelphia', 'review',

Beckett wins the case, and is promoted by his firm. He is entrusted with the task of representing one of the firm's most important clients. He's young, successful, and appears set to excel in his field. Miller is exposed as a TV celebrity and opportunist, who is more concerned with winning money for his clients than being ethical.Beckett is homosexual and contracts AIDS. He develops lesions all over his body, and some of them are visible. One of the firm's partners notices and fears that Beckett may have AIDS. Soon after, Beckett is fired.Do you remember when you first heard about AIDS? I remember it as a time of great panic. Nobody was immune from the disease, and we learned that it could be passed on by having a blood transfusion or unprotected sex. Imagine being a nurse and having a needle accidentally break your skin, and wondering if you would contract the disease. But, despite the fact that everyone was at risk, AIDS was primarily considered a disease which affected the gay community.Should someone be fired for having a life-threatening disease? Does it matter whether their current performance is exceptional, even though it will almost certainly deteriorate in the future? This story is about Beckett's fight to sue his former firm for wrongful dismissal. After trying to enlist the help of nine other lawyers, he eventual turns to Miller. We discover that Miller is severely homophobic, and his ignorance of AIDS makes him fear Beckett's very presence. The story educates both the audience and Miller during it's two-hour journey. Although we know much more about AIDS now, it was important to hear stories like this when the disease was relatively new on the scene.Miller's initial instinct was to get as far away from Beckett as he could. In fact, some people will never see Philadelphia for similar reasons. Homophobia is not as common as it used to be, but it still exists. Another reason that the film won't have a large audience is the debilitating nature of the disease. It's uncomfortable to see somebody become ill, knowing that they might well die. I understand the decision to avoid that kind of subject matter, but entertainment comes in many forms. The reason I enjoy Philadelphia is the strength of the central performances from Hanks and Washington.The second half of the film focuses on the courtroom battle between Miller, representing Beckett, and the firm which ultimately fired Beckett. If you enjoy courtroom dramas, Philadelphia does well with that aspect of the story. Demme makes some interesting choices, occasionally making the actors speak directly into the camera. It has the effect of placing us in the position of the judge or the witness giving evidence, and grabs our attention.Hanks was at his peak in the 90s and early 2000s, and this Oscar-winning performance is one of his best. Washington has been great for 20 years, and his performance should not be missed either.Philadelphia also won an Oscar for best song (Bruce Springsteen), and closes with another nominee (Neil Young). The music fits the mood perfectly.If you enjoy good acting, serious drama, or stories that really matter, Philadelphia is worth your time. Some say that it is dated and overly-manipulative, but sometimes it's good to manipulate the audience when the message is important enough to warrant it. This is one of those times.The North American Blu-ray release is from Twilight Time, and is limited to 3,000 copies.

The just of the plot deals with what Andrew Beckett(the Hanks character) goes through, everything from homophobia, to his realization that he will die from this dreadful disease, to wanting justice served.""Philadelphia"" was really the first Hollywood mainstream film to tackle the issues of AIDS, homosexuality, and homophobia dead-on, and the fact that it was a huge hit upon its release in 1993 (the movie grossed over $200,000,000) signifies that audiences were ready for a good story that dealt with these issues.Tom Hanks' portrayal of Andrew Beckett is probably the best of his career. He even lost weight in real life to show the ravages of AIDS. Gay rights and AIDS activists applauded both Hanks and the filmmakers for creating both a compelling and innovative movie that few have ever forgotten.Others in the cast also gave extraordinary performances, most notably Denzel Washington who plays the homophobic lawyer Andrew hires in dealing with his case. The supporting roles too were filled with some of Hollywood's best including Joanne Woodward, Jason Robards, and Antonio Banderras who plays Andrew's lover.Johnathan Demme, most known for his work in 1991's ""The Silence of the Lambs"" directed this wonderful film, and Bruce Springsteen won an Academy Award for Best Song for ""The Streets of Philadelphia"".The 2 disc DVD set includes deleted scenes.",5,"""Disturbing To Watch, Yet A Very Important Film!""",1281657600,"08 13, 2010",2010,1584,"['Tom', 'Hanks', 'desevedly', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Actor', '1994', 'second', 'row', 'lawyer', 'dying', 'AIDS', 'who', 'fired', 'job', 'prestigious', 'law', 'firm', 'then', 'firm', 'basis', 'was', 'unjustly', 'fired', 'just', 'plot', 'deals', 'what', 'Andrew', 'Beckett', 'Hanks', 'character', 'everything', 'homophobia', 'realization', 'will', 'die', 'dreadful', 'disease', 'wanting', 'justice', 'served', 'Philadelphia', 'was', 'really', 'first', 'Hollywood', 'mainstream', 'film', 'tackle', 'issues', 'AIDS', 'homosexuality', 'homophobia', 'dead-on', 'fact', 'was', 'huge', 'hit', 'release', '1993', 'movie', 'grossed', '200,000,000', 'signifies', 'audiences', 'were', 'ready', 'good', 'story', 'dealt', 'issues.Tom', 'Hanks', 'portrayal', 'Andrew', 'Beckett', 'probably', 'best', 'career', 'even', 'lost', 'weight', 'real', 'life', 'show', 'ravages', 'AIDS', 'Gay', 'rights', 'AIDS', 'activists', 'applauded', 'Hanks', 'filmmakers', 'creating', 'compelling', 'innovative', 'movie', 'few', 'have', 'ever', 'forgotten.Others', 'cast', 'also', 'gave', 'extraordinary', 'performances', 'most', 'notably', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'who', 'homophobic', 'lawyer', 'Andrew', 'dealing', 'case', 'supporting', 'roles', 'too', 'were', 'filled', 'Hollywood', 'best', 'including', 'Joanne', 'Woodward', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'Antonio', 'Banderras', 'who', 'Andrew', 'lover.Johnathan', 'Demme', 'most', 'known', 'work', '1991', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'directed', 'wonderful', 'film', 'Bruce', 'Springsteen', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Song', 'Streets', 'Philadelphia', '2', 'disc', 'DVD', 'set', 'deleted', 'scenes']",N/A
9738,A3D6TFYRMIV3ZL,0767809270,Themis-Athena,"[38, 47]","""This is the essence of discrimination: Formulating opinions about others not based on their individual merits, but rather on their membership in a group with assumed characteristics.""  (School Board of Nassau County v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273 (1987) (Brennan, J.), on remand, 692 F. Supp. 1286 (M.D. Fla. 1988)).  This rule, reaffirmed by the landmark Supreme Court decision which, over the dissent of Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice Scalia, first recognized the infection with a contagious disease (tuberculosis) as an actionable handicap under federal law, forms the initial bond between star litigator Andrew Beckett (Tom Hanks) and ambulance chaser Joe Miller (Denzel Washington), the unlikely team at the center of this movie.  Because through these words, black attorney Miller begins to realize that his colleague Beckett faces a handicap which, in essence, is not so different from that confronted by many of his fellow African Americans.  And because this is an incredibly effectively scripted Hollywood movie, we, the audience, easily get the point as well; even if we're white, and even if we're not gay and/or suffering from AIDS like Beckett.Of course, the insidiousness of the AIDS virus places those afflicted with it in a class of their own, and while the movie spares its viewers the pictures of some of the virus's most graphic effects, it does go to considerable length to show the physical decline associated with it - not only in the person of Beckett himself, for whose role Hanks literally almost starved himself.  Some of the patients surrounding him in the movie's earlier emergency room scenes really were AIDS patients, whom Hanks had approached when preparing for the movie, and who had subsequently agreed to participate; and as Hanks emphasized during an appearance in Bravo TV's ""Inside the Actors' Studio,"" not all of them are still alive. - Denzel Washington's appropriately named Joe Miller, middle class everyman in everything but the color of his skin (one of the movie's obvious bows to political correctness), displays an attitude uncomfortably familiar to many of us; shunning gays in general and the HIV-infected Beckett in particular, out of a mixture of ignorance about AIDS, prejudice against those suffering from it, and prejudice against gays.  Both Hanks and Washington give strikingly emotional, profound performances that rank among the best in their respective careers - Hanks deservedly won both the Oscar and the Golden Globe for his portrayal of Beckett, but Washington unfairly wasn't even nominated for either.  Yet, neither of them would have been able to shine as much as they do without their exceptional supporting cast; to name just two, Jason Robards, commanding as ever as Beckett's homophobic former boss (and role model!), and Antonio Banderas as his devoted lover.By the time of ""Philadelphia""'s release, some of the early myths about AIDS had begun to disappear, and the yearly growing numbers of newly infected patients had brought it out of its erstwhile obscurity as ""the gay plague.""  But indepth knowledge was still far from widespread, and therefore the movie not only brought awareness to the disease in general, but also made a couple of important points, from educating the public about the disease's method of transmission to emphasizing that it is by no means limited to gays and can even be contracted in something as life-affirming as a blood transfusion.  (Indeed, several European countries were rocked by transfusion-related AIDS scandals right around the time of the movie's release).  One of ""Philadelphia""'s most quietly powerful scenes is the testimony of a female witness who was infected by just such a transfusion, and who emphasizes that having AIDS is not a matter of sin or morality:  ""I don't consider myself any different from anyone else with this disease.  I'm not guilty, I'm not innocent, I'm just trying to survive,"" she responds when asked to confirm that in her case ""there was no behavior on [her] part"" involved and contracting AIDS was something she was ""unable to avoid."" - Moreover, four years before Ellen DeGeneres rocked the showboat with a kiss during an episode of her sitcom, and Kevin Kline and Magnum macho Tom Selleck locked lips in ""In and Out"" (the screenplay of which was inspired by Hanks's Oscar acceptance speech for ""Philadelphia""), it was by no means a given that a movie would get away with letting Hanks and Banderas exchange acts of tenderness from caresses and kisses on the hand to a slow dance at a gay party.Given ""Philadelphia""'s fundamental message and the memorable performances of its protagonists, it is a pity that the movie doesn't entirely avoid Hollywood pitfalls, such as its soggy ending with grease literally dripping off the screen and the undeniable taste of a sugar-coated afterthought, transmitting the message that even dying of AIDS is really not so terrible, at least for the surviving family who can still unite around the television set and wallow in their memories of their lost loved one.  And while I do buy Joe Miller's transformation from a (somewhat stereotypical) homophobic male to a reluctant supporter of gay rights, I don't really see why Beckett suddenly assumes a cliche gay look the second he has been fired; not to mention that I suspect not everybody in his situation would have enjoyed such overwhelming support from his family.But ultimately, it is the movie's overarching message that counts.  ""Ain't no angel gonna greet me; it's just you and I my friend ... and my clothes don't fit me no more: I walked a thousand miles just to slip this skin,"" sings Bruce Springsteen, the movie's other Oscar winner, in ""Philadelphia""'s title song.  And Justice Brennan wrote in the Supreme Court's Arline decision that in amending federal law, Congress was motivated by ""discrimination stemming not only from simple prejudice, but also from archaic attitudes and laws.""  This movie goes a long way in dispelling such attitudes.  It alone isn't enough - but it is, as Andrew Beckett jokes about the 1000 lawyers chained together at the bottom of the ocean, a good start.Also recommended:PhiladelphiaAnd the Band Played On:

9742,AP3B615GM191G,0767809270,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[2, 2]","Over the last few years, I have been churning my way through the films of Denzel Washington.  I love the intensity and passion he brings to his roles, plus the fact that, ""Manchurian Candidate"" aside, he hasn't really been in any bad films.  For whatever reason, I had not yet seen ""Philadelphia"", which is hailed by film critics and garnered Tom Hanks a Best Actor academy award in 1992.  After viewing, I found it to be not as epic as some would have me believe, but still an interesting two hours nonetheless.The basic plot of the film is the story of two lawyers (Denzel and Hanks).  Hanks' character contracts AIDS and enlists the help of ""Washington"" to help him file a discrimination lawsuit against the company that fired him (supposedly due to the disease).  Along the way, the plot actually morphs to become more of a ""panel discussion"" on the treatment/perception of gay people in the United States.In dealing with such a sensitive topic, the film is able to lay out its message without sounding too crass or too offensive to either side.  Basically, director Jonathan Demme knows that viewers will obviously have pre-determined attitudes about the issue before viewing the film, and thus doesn't try to sway any perceptions.  Instead, through the legal, court-room setting, he just invites both sides to think about the issues at hand and consider possible scenarios.  I liken it to a more recent Denzel Washington film entitled ""The Great Debaters"", which discussed the issue of the Jim Crow south through a high school debate team.  Some pretty meaty issues were thrown around, but under the guise of ""debate"" the viewers don't really feel any compulsion to take a side, instead just being privy to the information.  A similar factor is what I believe is the true brilliance of Demme's film...he treats the viewers like a jury and allows us to come to our own conclusion about the issues he is discussing.Thus, unless you have incredibly strong feelings one way or the other about the issue of gay rights (then the film is bound to upset in its generalization of the topic), I would recommend this film to pretty much anyone.  While it may not live up to critical hype (likely due to the fact that critics are usually bonkers over artsy or heavy-themed films), it will give you some things to think about.",4,"Not Quite Epic, But Will Make You Think",1249689600,"08 8, 2009",2009,2319,"['last', 'few', 'years', 'have', 'been', 'churning', 'way', 'films', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'love', 'intensity', 'passion', 'roles', 'fact', 'Manchurian', 'Candidate', 'aside', ""n't"", 'really', 'been', 'bad', 'films', 'reason', 'had', 'not', 'yet', 'seen', 'Philadelphia', 'hailed', 'film', 'critics', 'garnered', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Best', 'Actor', 'award', '1992', 'viewing', 'found', 'be', 'not', 'as', 'epic', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'still', 'interesting', 'two', 'hours', 'nonetheless.The', 'basic', 'plot', 'film', 'story', 'two', 'lawyers', 'Denzel', 'Hanks', 'Hanks', 'character', 'contracts', 'AIDS', 'help', 'Washington', 'help', 'file', 'discrimination', 'lawsuit', 'company', 'fired', 'supposedly', 'due', 'disease', 'way', 'plot', 'actually', 'become', 'more', 'panel', 'discussion', 'treatment/perception', 'gay', 'people', 'United', 'States.In', 'dealing', 'sensitive', 'topic', 'film', 'able', 'lay', 'out', 'message', 'sounding', 'too', 'crass', 'too', 'offensive', 'side', 'Basically', 'director', 'Jonathan', 'Demme', 'viewers', 'will', 'obviously', 'have', 'pre-determined', 'attitudes', 'issue', 'viewing', 'film', 'thus', ""n't"", 'try', 'sway', 'perceptions', 'Instead', 'legal', 'court-room', 'setting', 'just', 'sides', 'think', 'issues', 'hand', 'consider', 'possible', 'scenarios', 'liken', 'more', 'recent', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'film', 'entitled', 'Great', 'Debaters', 'discussed', 'issue', 'Jim', 'Crow', 'high', 'school', 'debate', 'team', 'pretty', 'meaty', 'issues', 'were', 'thrown', 'around', 'guise', 'debate', 'viewers', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'feel', 'compulsion', 'take', 'side', 'instead', 'just', 'being', 'privy', 'information', 'similar', 'factor', 'what', 'believe', 'true', 'brilliance', 'Demme', 'film', 'viewers', 'jury', 'come', 'own', 'conclusion', 'issues', 'discussing.Thus', 'have', 'incredibly', 'strong', 'feelings', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'issue', 'gay', 'rights', 'then', 'film', 'bound', 'upset', 'generalization', 'topic', 'would', 'recommend', 'film', 'pretty', 'much', 'anyone', 'may', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'critical', 'hype', 'likely', 'due', 'fact', 'critics', 'are', 'usually', 'bonkers', 'heavy-themed', 'films', 'will', 'give', 'things', 'think']",N/A
