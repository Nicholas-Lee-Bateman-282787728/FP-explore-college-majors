As a big fan of stand up comedy I eagerly purchased this video the day it was released.  Unfortunately I did not find it as entertaining as some of his earlier work.  The bathroom humor was way too much and his ""scenarios"" tended to run a little long.  How long can you milk the vacation or niece wedding pieces?  If you really want to laugh at some Steve Harvey stuff then check out his very early video from the 1990s:  One Man Show.  This one will make you laugh until you cry as he covers material like the difference between blacks and whites--hilarious but never mean spirited.  By itself the jokes about how blacks and whites ""do"" their weekends and handle getting fired are worth the cost of the video.  And his interpretation of his church lady creation ""Mrs. Odell"" will have you falling over with laughter.  His performance as the host of the 2000 tour and movie, ""The Kings of Comedy"" was also superb to the ""Still Trippin"" DVD.  And if you can locate a very early stand up piece--early 1990's--where the talks about Susan Smith and O. J. Simpson--then by all means you've gotten Steve Harvey at the top of his game.

Well, part of it because I turned it off in disgust after a while. I was shocked and sickened to hear his comments on the Michael Vick dog fighting/tortuing case. Instead of showing outrage and condemnation of Vick's vile acts, he PRAISED him and made fun of his sickening crime. He made light of Vick's violent and hateful torture and killing of those dogs.I couldn't believe my ears when he actually said, ""---- them dogs! Let the boy PLAY!""  Yes, that's what he actually said. he was ENCOURAGING his audience to be cruel to animals. I was shocked to see some of them were actually laughing and applauding and all excited about the garbage Harvey was spewing. Sad to see, even though there will always be evil in the world, it looked like there was a fair share of it in Harvey's audience by the reactions I saw to his disgusting comments. I will NEVER in my life watch any show with this guy in it. I will never buy products that sponsor any of his shows. He also said that when the news of that story broke out he had to lie on his radio show and say, ""Ohhh poor dogs"" which he laughed about and scoffed at saying he HAD to lie about his real feelings and say that because he ""has sponsors"".

This is a huge step-up from his last performance (Don't trip...).This show is side-splittingly funny. I had bought this dvd with plenty of trepidation, given the disappointments I've suffered at Harvey's faltering performances in recent times. My trepidation seemed to be realised early on when he started talking about the woman who questioned whether it was acceptable for her to wipe her fat hubby's bottom. In my opinion, he went on for too long on that subject and that was probably what deprived him of the fifth star in my rating.Once he got started though, there was no letting up. He brought the house down with laugh-a-minute kind of humour. His style is quite narrative and fairly uncomplicated. He manages to string 2 or 3 jokes per sentence. My favourite piece is the one about his ghetto niece, her ghetto boyfriend, and their ghetto wedding. This is the pinnacle of his performance of the night.All other subjects were tackled with intelligent hilarity. This is my favourite disc by Steve.

Recently, I stumbled on Steve Harvey's early 90s standup and found it hilarious. Reading up on the man and watching various interviews, I too have qualms about some of the things Harvey says. Regardless, I find him hilariously funny and I found this stand-up special to be comedic gold.From what I gathered from early material, Harvey has always been religious, but he seems to have become even more religious in the several years leading up to this stand-up special. The Steve Harvey I had grown to like was frequently cussing and incorporating vulgar material into his act, so I had reservations about how funny this would be; especially since he begins the show by mentioning God. Despite being religious, more so than ever, he cusses frequently here and his humor doesn't stretch too far from the humor I liked. Sure he has religious material, and other material that provides a good example of why some people really don't like him, but you'll notice on this feature that even the audience quiets down through some of it. Some viewers will have issues with Harvey when he discusses voting for Barack Obama solely due to his race, but I didn't find any of his material offensive or disagreeable enough to warrant branding the entire special ""unfunny.""Over 90 minutes Harvey covers an eclectic array of material, beginning with his complaints about interviewing Michael Clarke Duncan on his radio show and finding that Duncan was appearing in a remake of Planet of the Apes. From there, he discusses his children wanting dreadlocks and tattoos, his family (and how he doesn't like them), Barack Obama, a trip to Africa, and more. What makes Harvey such an effective comedian is his mastery of various comedic forms. He has hilarious delivery, amusing facial expressions; his humor can appeal to those both smart and dumb, both white and black. While he may be a flawed human being (to some), he's an undeniably brilliant comedian.His jokes about his niece and her ""ghetto"" wedding are brilliant and laugh-out-loud funny. This tirade is arguably the funniest part of the show. Some of his monologues are admittedly lengthy and do seem to stretch on a tad bit too long, but few comedians could do stand-up for 90 minutes straight and be consistently entertaining and funny for that amount of time. If you like Harvey and can overcome any bias you may have about him; this is a high-quality stand-up release with some remarkably funny material. He's a changed man, but Steve Harvey is still trippin' and still funny as hell.GRADE: A-",5,Steve Harvey: Still Funny,1313625600,"08 18, 2011",2011,2774,"['who', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Steve', 'Harvey', 'fall', 'two', 'camps', '1', 'obvious', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'funny', '2', 'disagree', 'so', 'vehemently', 'issues', 'such', 'race', 'religion', 'politics', 'automatically', 'deem', 'unfunny', 'Recently', 'stumbled', 'Steve', 'Harvey', 'early', '90s', 'standup', 'found', 'hilarious', 'Reading', 'up', 'man', 'watching', 'various', 'interviews', 'too', 'have', 'qualms', 'things', 'Harvey', 'Regardless', 'find', 'hilariously', 'funny', 'found', 'stand-up', 'special', 'be', 'comedic', 'what', 'gathered', 'early', 'material', 'Harvey', 'always', 'been', 'religious', 'have', 'become', 'even', 'more', 'religious', 'several', 'years', 'leading', 'up', 'stand-up', 'special', 'Steve', 'Harvey', 'had', 'grown', 'like', 'was', 'frequently', 'cussing', 'incorporating', 'vulgar', 'material', 'act', 'had', 'reservations', 'how', 'funny', 'would', 'be', 'especially', 'show', 'mentioning', 'God', 'being', 'religious', 'more', 'so', 'ever', 'frequently', 'here', 'humor', ""n't"", 'stretch', 'too', 'far', 'humor', 'liked', 'Sure', 'religious', 'material', 'other', 'material', 'good', 'example', 'why', 'people', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'feature', 'even', 'audience', 'quiets', 'down', 'viewers', 'will', 'have', 'issues', 'Harvey', 'when', 'voting', 'Barack', 'Obama', 'solely', 'due', 'race', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'material', 'offensive', 'disagreeable', 'enough', 'warrant', 'branding', 'entire', 'special', 'unfunny', '90', 'minutes', 'Harvey', 'eclectic', 'array', 'material', 'beginning', 'complaints', 'interviewing', 'Michael', 'Clarke', 'Duncan', 'radio', 'show', 'finding', 'Duncan', 'was', 'appearing', 'remake', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'there', 'children', 'wanting', 'dreadlocks', 'tattoos', 'family', 'how', ""n't"", 'like', 'Barack', 'Obama', 'trip', 'Africa', 'more', 'What', 'Harvey', 'effective', 'comedian', 'mastery', 'various', 'comedic', 'forms', 'hilarious', 'delivery', 'amusing', 'facial', 'expressions', 'humor', 'can', 'appeal', 'smart', 'dumb', 'white', 'black', 'may', 'be', 'flawed', 'human', 'being', 'undeniably', 'brilliant', 'comedian.His', 'niece', 'ghetto', 'wedding', 'are', 'brilliant', 'laugh-out-loud', 'funny', 'tirade', 'arguably', 'funniest', 'part', 'show', 'monologues', 'are', 'admittedly', 'lengthy', 'do', 'seem', 'stretch', 'tad', 'bit', 'too', 'long', 'few', 'comedians', 'could', 'do', 'stand-up', '90', 'minutes', 'straight', 'be', 'consistently', 'entertaining', 'funny', 'amount', 'time', 'like', 'Harvey', 'can', 'overcome', 'bias', 'may', 'have', 'high-quality', 'stand-up', 'release', 'remarkably', 'funny', 'material', 'changed', 'man', 'Steve', 'Harvey', 'still', 'trippin', 'still', 'funny', 'hell.GRADE', 'A-']",Steve Harvey - Still Trippin'

I'm not into bathroom humor, so I was kinda like ""Let's get on with the next joke please."" Considering I'm a hardcore dog lover and have zero sympathy for Michael Vick, I wasn't into the dog fighting joke either, but I do understand his point about Sean Bell. I definitely wanted him to keep the Obama voting joke to himself because I hope we didn't just vote on this man because he's Black. If that's the case, we may as well vote for Condoleezza Rice or Clarence Thomas too, and we all know that'd be a disaster.Pros: His niece's wedding had me crying laughing so hard that my stomach hurt. Watermelon wagon? Black crows? I loved it! The joke about dude who is in ""Planet of the Apes"" was funny. I liked that monkey joke and I even liked the one about Africa and the monkeys, but it was just when we got into bodily functions that I was like ""Ugh."" However, Steve is funny. I don't regret getting the DVD, but I just wish he'd have done one bodily function joke if at all. But I like this cat. He tells it like it is, and considering I've interviewed him before, I know he's nonstop funny. I'd recommend it if only for the wedding joke. That one made the whole DVD for me.
