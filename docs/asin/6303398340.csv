372335,A1K548TDR33DMN,6303398340,Anna Shlimovich,"[3, 7]","This is a marvelous insight into a concert of the greatest pianist of our time at the age of 83.  It is remarkable how well he plays in the beginning, and everything he plays is from memory.Yet with all my admiration, I assign this performance more a sentimental value than the true virtuoso one;  in a way, it is a sad recording, because it is noticeable of how tired maestro becomes towards the end, not able to hide the mistakes;  it is somewhat disheartening to see him making a tremendous effort, yet the keys seem not to obey him as they did 20 years before.  I think he was unhappy that he could not play flawlessly and could not control his own inability.  It must have been deeply frustrating for Horowitz to play with clearly heard errors.I suspected that many would assign people's tears during Schumann's ""Traumerei"" to the artistry of Horowitz playing.  The truth is that whenever someone important in USSR died, the radio would endlessly play this music.  It has become so closely associated with death; and during the concert those shedding tears were probably recalling the losses of someones dear to them, reacting as Pavlov's dog to this tune.  Of course, Horowitz plays it masterfully, but this is not why people in the audience were crying.It is actually quite interesting to see the attendees of the performance; the tickets were definitely distributed by unions, given as rewards to exemplary workers, as to USSR Army officers that one can see in the sala,  party bosses, young communist leaders, etc, - in short, to all those who had never attended a classical music concert before in their entire life.  Moscow Conservatory concerts were normally half-empty, but Horowitz was so exotic and notorious - a former emigrant, a suspect, in a way.  Viewers should not take what they see by face value and imagine that everyone in USSR knew and loved Horowitz; those who defected to the West were never viewed favorably from within mother Russia.But for this visit Horowitz was ordered to be celebrated and loved.  I am sure he felt some falseness in all that.To anyone who is familiar with his life story, and who had similar experiences in life, this video is full of nostalgic moments.  It is hard to say what Horowitz really experienced during this visit.  Stravinsky years before cut his visit short.  For a Russian emigrant who left because he could not stay it is never so easy and pleasant to be back, and I think Maestro's anguish after his sixty one years of absence shows - not when he is playing, but in the off-stage settings.This is somewhat a very emotional film; more than a concerto.

He had long passed that stage, both in  age and in fame. Instead, viewers are compensated with a fuller view of his subtle colours which he pushed to an utmost extreme, a revelation for many modern piano players. We also have some most heartfelt pieces by Horowitz however short they may be. Moreover, we can have sight of Tsaichovsky's home and his piano where the Maestro played a few phrases on it. We see what comes of Horowitz's rather colourless niece left behind in Russia. We also see the actual weeping of the Russians, invoked by Horowitz's playing, lamenting perhaps also their own unnecessary turns and twists in the face of Communism...Having been listening to this for years, I still find it a source of inspiration, albeit as far as music or the ingenuity of fixing the repertoire, Horowitz's ""Concert in Vienna"", filmed at about the same time, is even more appealing. Both are oozing with colours. But for a closer look at his fingers and touches, viewers should instead check out  ""Horowitz, The Last Romantic.""All in all, Horowitz by this stage surely would be able to win back Lipatti's admiration, if not Kopcsis's.",5,Another Must have!,1066348800,"10 17, 2003",2003,1449,"['was', 'not', 'easy', 'Horowitz', 'make', 'fame', 'inthe', 'Golden', 'Age', 'become', 'one', 'greats', 'late', 'age', 'admitted', 'had', 'limited', 'musical', 'background.In', 'DVD', 'however', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'see', 'fiery', 'scary', 'perfomances', 'Rachmaninov', 'Concerto', 'No.3', 'Metropolitan', 'Recital', 'had', 'long', 'passed', 'stage', 'age', 'fame', 'Instead', 'viewers', 'are', 'compensated', 'fuller', 'view', 'subtle', 'colours', 'pushed', 'utmost', 'extreme', 'revelation', 'many', 'modern', 'piano', 'players', 'also', 'have', 'most', 'heartfelt', 'pieces', 'Horowitz', 'however', 'short', 'may', 'be', 'Moreover', 'can', 'have', 'sight', 'Tsaichovsky', 'home', 'piano', 'where', 'Maestro', 'played', 'few', 'phrases', 'see', 'what', 'Horowitz', 'rather', 'colourless', 'niece', 'left', 'behind', 'Russia', 'also', 'see', 'actual', 'weeping', 'Russians', 'invoked', 'Horowitz', 'playing', 'lamenting', 'perhaps', 'also', 'own', 'unnecessary', 'turns', 'twists', 'face', 'Communism', 'Having', 'been', 'listening', 'years', 'still', 'find', 'source', 'inspiration', 'albeit', 'as', 'far', 'music', 'ingenuity', 'fixing', 'repertoire', 'Horowitz', 'Concert', 'Vienna', 'filmed', 'same', 'time', 'even', 'more', 'appealing', 'are', 'oozing', 'colours', 'closer', 'look', 'fingers', 'touches', 'viewers', 'should', 'instead', 'check', 'out', 'Horowitz', 'Last', 'Romantic', 'Horowitz', 'stage', 'surely', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'win', 'back', 'Lipatti', 'admiration', 'not', 'Kopcsis']",N/A

The performers are all so good, that I'm reduced to admiration and have little else to say.  I remember many years ago I was listening to NPR, they had a female musical expert on and they were testing her, they had both Rubinstein and Horowitz play something by Chopin, she was supposed to identify the pianist.  She guessed wrong both times.  I guessed right.  I thought at the time that Rubinstein was the supreme player of Chopin, and I thought the Horowitz version was cold.  This was many years ago, and while I still prefer Rubinstein's Chopin (warmer), Horowitz is my hero, my favorite pianist, though I'm not nuts about his customary choices of composers.  But this flick.  It is a perfect gem (and so tragically underpriced, anyone can afford it).  The drama of the arrival, Horowitz' conversation, the shots of the audience (some of whom, yes, were crying), the marvelous close-ups of his hands (his nails were unclipped and seemed to be dirty, and he doesn't arch his fingers which my very dim and distant piano teacher used to tell me was imperative, though he does it some on the right hand), and the music.  It was glorious.  I love Horowitz.  One glitch.  There would be.  My disc was defective, and somewhere during the penultimate piece it screwed up, so I didn't get to see the whole thing, I missed the last 2 pieces of music and whatever dramatic or ""human interest"" ending was on the film.  But good old Amazon is already getting ready to ship me a replacement and tonight I returned the defective copy.  I'll have the new one in 2 days.  One last note.

Horowitz chooses smaller, personal pieces, fending off autumnal aspects with characteristic elan, but clearly a man profoundly moved by playing once again in Russia. This is the Russian charism, always returning; Horowitz embodies it body and soul in this film. A brilliant energy of Reunion blasts every frame and ends a cut above the ordinary concert document. In the Russian way, in the end, what's left unsaid makes the profoundest sound. Horowitz isn't a pianist for everybody; he was annoying as hell at times, even when pointing a way deep into music.

Motivated by years away from his homeland, Horowitz pours his soul into the piano and to the audience, to profound effect.PS: I hope you find this review helpful.I appreciate any helpful votes, if you think this review worthy!Peter:)",5,"A Uniquely Profound Performance, HIGHLY Recommended!",1404691200,"07 7, 2014",2014,759,"['Here', 'have', 'Horowitz', 'return', 'USSR', 'decades', 'long', 'exile', 'something', 'transcendental', 'performance', 'something', 'intangible', 'oh', 'so', 'beautiful', 'playing', 'audience', 'audience', 'starved', 'genius', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'emotional', 'release', 'almost', 'too', 'much', 'bear', 'teared', 'up', 'several', 'times', 'Horowitz', 'sacred', 'connection', 'audience', 'connection', 'technique', 'even', 'artistry', 'deeply', 'personal', 'organic', 'recital', 'statement', 'forlorn', 'exuberance', 'Motivated', 'years', 'away', 'homeland', 'Horowitz', 'soul', 'piano', 'audience', 'profound', 'effect.PS', 'hope', 'find', 'review', 'helpful.I', 'appreciate', 'helpful', 'votes', 'think', 'review', 'worthy', 'Peter']",N/A

His playing is sublime (except for the last Chopin piece - polonaise- which he wrestled with a bit) and the occasion is made more poignant by the audiences reaction. An old man playing his beloved music for his homeland friends. Very moving.

As the photographer pans the audience during Schuman's Traumerei, a gentleman of indistinct years is shown in a stoic pose, with the exception of a tear falling off his cheek.
