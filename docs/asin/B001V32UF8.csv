It's just propulsive story telling at one of its best. You really do get a sense how scuzzy New York was back in the early 80's. The editing. The acting(special shout out to Zoe Lund who gives an INCREDIBLE performance). The direction. All top notch. This is not a time killer movie. It engages you on a deep primal level. Out of all the vigilante flicks this was hands down the best I've seen. Yeah I'm gonna go there...it's better than DEATH WISH. After you see it you might come to the same realization. This is gonna be one of those movies where the cult around it is gonna grow.

While I found it incredibly easy to sympathize for the pain and degradation she experiences, not to mention how much I completely understood her subsequent anger, I was unsure of where the character was going once she embarks on a killing spree of every man she perceives as a sexist lowlife whose ultimate goal revolves around controlling and using a woman's body until her soul is all that is left, which is every bit as wounded and unforgiving. Was she going to kill forever or would she eventually stop and start to live her life again? Since she begins to see all men as evil and decides to destroy even those who mean her no harm, there is only one way the film can end, so it becomes rather predictable on that note.

1242720,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B001V32UF8,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[9, 10]","In the seventies and early eighties, a sub-genre of the action exploitation market was the revenge thriller.  In mainstream movies, the Death Wish franchise which kicked off so strongly in 1974 kept Charles Bronson seeking vigilante style justice for almost two decades (with less and less payoff for its audience).  And underground filmmakers also found a natural niche in these violent endeavors.  One of the most notorious pictures of the era was 1978's ""I Spit on Your Grave,"" where a woman strikes back against those who have violated her.  These are but a few of the many highlights of the genre, and both were significant precursors and influences for director Abel Ferrara's similarly themed ""Ms. 45.""  From 1981, this movie may be less well known than some of the bigger titles, but it still stands as an interesting example of vigilante excess.  A new DVD/Blu-ray label, Drafthouse Films, is giving us a second look at this somewhat forgotten film and offers us quite a few extras including interviews and featurettes.The heroine of ""Ms. 45"" is a mute young woman working in New York's fashion district.  So unprepossessing and retiring, she barely makes an impact at all as the movie begins.  Of course, the screenplay makes the streets of New York very mean indeed with over-the-top scenarios that have virtually every woman mauled any time she steps out into public.  Trust me, there's nothing subtle here.  Early on, the young seamstress named Thana (well played by Zo Lund) is brutally attacked not just once, but twice in about fifteen minutes.  I told you these were mean streets!  As she lashes out in self-defense, it will forever change the course of her life.  She finds a new sense of purpose and female empowerment as she takes back the night from the criminal element using a trusty 45 caliber gun.  But as Thana enjoys a newfound confidence, it also comes at a cost.  Will her lust for blood against the men who have wronged women everywhere push her over the edge?  As Thana is mute, we see the subtle (and some more obvious) shifts in her demeanor and this character evolution is what makes ""Ms. 45"" stand out.  Is Thana growing stronger or simply slipping into insanity?  It's a fine line and an interesting point to pursue.I won't reveal any more about ""Ms. 45,"" but the movie is also assisted by Ferrara's unique visual flourish, a propulsive soundtrack, and Lund's adept performance.  This was an early effort for Ferrara's who went on to do some great movies (Bad Lieutenant) as well as some painfully obtuse ones (4:44 Last Day on Earth).  Here, he takes advantage of the expectations within the low budget exploitation genre and tweaks them with subversive glee.  ""Ms. 45,"" though, is certainly a product of its time.  It is both garish and over-the-top, but it does work with its modest goals.  As Lund transforms, the movie (though not perfect or polished) is hard to look away from and, in my estimation, that is what makes it worth a viewing for those with an interest in this type of filmmaking.

Personally I hated watching ""Killer"" even though some perceive (gruesome) black humour in it and it is available on DVD in the UK.  ""Ms"" was hardly 'cheery' viewing either but I thought it was far more compelling and better made, having a certain kinship with Polanski's fine ""Repulsion"" (1965,b/w) about another deadly female protagonist (a very young Catherine Deneuve) that tears into your heart.  These are superior to anything that Michael Winner used to dish up. Ferrara's location filming in New York eschews shots of the Twin Towers and makes the city a quirky character in its own right (Polanski's London flat setting being more deliberately claustrophobic).  Ferrara does a great job with his mute gun-toting lead Zoe Lund (then Zoe Tamerlis) a seething flame preying on her male moths.  She was never in anything as memorable again and sadly died early, apparently of substance abuse.M. Britton seems to have enjoyed a well-projected showing of this movie.

1242725,A3VO8JQT6LVXZ1,B001V32UF8,Richard Ross,"[1, 2]","In 1992 director Abel Ferrara and writer/actress Zoe Lund shocked the world with 'Bad Lieutenant'. A decade before that they teamed up for the first time and created  1981's rape/revenge fever dream 'Ms.45'. Both films are shocking and explicit in their depiction of sex, drugs, violence and nihilism. Both are uncompromising masterpieces.Mute seamstress Thana (Lund nee Tamerlis) works in the Garment District and lives alone in a studio apartment. Surrounded by a flirty boss, gossipy co-workers and a nosy landlord, Thana feels intimidated and out of place. One afternoon while walking home from work she gets pulled into a grimy alley (by a masked Ferrara) and brutally raped. After staggering home a shell-shocked Thana is again raped, this time by a home intruder. Fighting back, Thana kills her attacker and hides his bloody .45  handgun in her drawer. Suffering from flashbacks, she's too shaken to use it. That all changes a few days later when she mows down a guy who charges her in an empty alley. Terrified at first, Thana soon becomes emboldened and gives herself a drastic makeover. She dyes her hair, pulls it back into a ponytail, slathers on red lipstick and squeezes into tight tops and leather pants. Setting her sights on men who get off exploiting women, Thana embarks on a killing spree. Feeling in control for the first time in her life, Thana becomes drunk with power and snaps. She starts dressing like Little Red Riding Hood and chasing men who pose no threat to her or anyone else.  The film culminates with Thana - decked out in a nun's habit and garters - descending on her office Halloween party like a literal Angel of Vengeance and laying waste to everyone.The film is not without its flaws. For one, Thana is never in any real danger of being overpowered by her victims and aside from a front page newspaper report her crimes go unreported and the cops are neither seen nor heard from at all in the movie. That's a rather glaring omission in my opinion, but I understand this movie is supposed to be a revenge fantasy told entirely from the viewpoint of the main character. It's also pretty gory but what else do you expect when the director's previous film was called 'The Driller Killer'. (See if you can spot the poster in the background during the Halloween party). And no matter how reprehensible the on-screen antics are, you know you're watching two amazing artists at the peak of their talent behind the camera. This was only Abel's second feature film but the improvements in craftsmanship are remarkable. But obviously the star of the show is Zoe. She utters only one word in the entire film yet her performance is one of the most talked about in all of cult cinema. As Ferrara notes in his brief but emotional interview included on the immaculate Blu-Ray this is Zoe when she was 17 and had never touched drugs or alcohol. She was already a college student who spoke five languages, played music, wrote poetry, modeled, etc. Soon after 'Ms.45' she got hooked on heroin and the two had a falling out. They wouldn't work together again until 'Bad Lieutenant' which they co-wrote together, though Lund claims she wrote it herself. Watching her in that movie - especially in HD - shooting up will turn your stomach. Seven years later she'd be dead in Paris at 37. Tragic stuff. It's obvious she was a tremendous talent. Though she wrote and acted in other films, her work with Ferrara is her most iconic. At least Abel lived long enough to get clean. Sober for two and a half years he's enjoying a career resurgence garnering rave reviews for his latest film 'Welcome To New York'. Thanks to that film and the re-release of this one he's finally getting the respect he deserves. It's taken 30+ years but now he's acknowledged as one of the most important and influential independent filmmakers of all time. If you're at all interested, buy this Blu-Ray immediately.",5,"Abel, Zoe And The Raped Nun Part 1",1403568000,"06 24, 2014",2014,3905,"['1992', 'director', 'Abel', 'Ferrara', 'writer/actress', 'Zoe', 'Lund', 'shocked', 'world', ""'Bad"", 'Lieutenant', 'decade', 'teamed', 'up', 'first', 'time', 'created', '1981', 'rape/revenge', 'fever', 'dream', 'films', 'are', 'shocking', 'explicit', 'depiction', 'sex', 'drugs', 'violence', 'nihilism', 'are', 'uncompromising', 'masterpieces.Mute', 'seamstress', 'Thana', 'Lund', 'nee', 'Tamerlis', 'Garment', 'District', 'alone', 'studio', 'apartment', 'Surrounded', 'flirty', 'boss', 'gossipy', 'co-workers', 'nosy', 'landlord', 'Thana', 'feels', 'intimidated', 'place', 'One', 'afternoon', 'walking', 'home', 'work', 'pulled', 'grimy', 'alley', 'masked', 'Ferrara', 'brutally', 'raped', 'staggering', 'home', 'shell-shocked', 'Thana', 'again', 'raped', 'time', 'home', 'intruder', 'Fighting', 'back', 'Thana', 'attacker', 'bloody', '.45', 'handgun', 'drawer', 'Suffering', 'flashbacks', 'too', 'shaken', 'use', 'few', 'days', 'later', 'when', 'down', 'guy', 'who', 'empty', 'alley', 'Terrified', 'first', 'Thana', 'soon', 'becomes', 'emboldened', 'drastic', 'makeover', 'dyes', 'hair', 'back', 'ponytail', 'slathers', 'red', 'lipstick', 'tight', 'tops', 'leather', 'pants', 'Setting', 'sights', 'men', 'who', 'get', 'exploiting', 'women', 'Thana', 'killing', 'spree', 'Feeling', 'control', 'first', 'time', 'life', 'Thana', 'drunk', 'power', 'snaps', 'dressing', 'Little', 'Red', 'Riding', 'Hood', 'chasing', 'men', 'who', 'pose', 'threat', 'anyone', 'else', 'film', 'Thana', 'decked', 'out', 'nun', 'habit', 'garters', 'descending', 'office', 'Halloween', 'party', 'literal', 'Angel', 'Vengeance', 'laying', 'waste', 'everyone.The', 'film', 'not', 'flaws', 'one', 'Thana', 'never', 'real', 'danger', 'being', 'overpowered', 'victims', 'aside', 'front', 'page', 'newspaper', 'report', 'crimes', 'go', 'unreported', 'cops', 'are', 'seen', 'heard', 'movie', 'rather', 'glaring', 'omission', 'opinion', 'understand', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'revenge', 'fantasy', 'told', 'entirely', 'viewpoint', 'main', 'character', 'also', 'pretty', 'gory', 'what', 'else', 'do', 'expect', 'when', 'director', 'previous', 'film', 'was', 'called', ""'The"", 'Driller', 'Killer', 'See', 'can', 'spot', 'poster', 'background', 'Halloween', 'party', 'matter', 'how', 'reprehensible', 'on-screen', 'antics', 'are', 'know', ""'re"", 'watching', 'two', 'amazing', 'artists', 'peak', 'talent', 'camera', 'was', 'only', 'Abel', 'second', 'feature', 'film', 'improvements', 'craftsmanship', 'are', 'remarkable', 'obviously', 'star', 'show', 'Zoe', 'only', 'one', 'word', 'entire', 'film', 'yet', 'performance', 'one', 'most', 'talked', 'cult', 'cinema', 'Ferrara', 'notes', 'brief', 'emotional', 'interview', 'included', 'immaculate', 'Blu-Ray', 'Zoe', 'when', 'was', '17', 'had', 'never', 'touched', 'drugs', 'alcohol', 'was', 'already', 'college', 'student', 'who', 'spoke', 'five', 'languages', 'played', 'music', 'wrote', 'poetry', 'modeled', 'etc', 'Soon', ""'Ms.45"", 'got', 'hooked', 'heroin', 'two', 'had', 'falling', 'out', 'would', ""n't"", 'work', 'together', 'again', ""'Bad"", 'Lieutenant', 'co-wrote', 'together', 'Lund', 'wrote', 'Watching', 'movie', 'especially', 'HD', 'shooting', 'up', 'will', 'turn', 'stomach', 'Seven', 'years', 'later', ""'d"", 'be', 'dead', 'Paris', '37', 'Tragic', 'stuff', 'obvious', 'was', 'tremendous', 'talent', 'wrote', 'acted', 'other', 'films', 'work', 'Ferrara', 'most', 'iconic', 'least', 'Abel', 'lived', 'long', 'enough', 'get', 'clean', 'Sober', 'two', 'half', 'years', 'enjoying', 'career', 'resurgence', 'garnering', 'rave', 'reviews', 'latest', 'film', 'New', 'York', 'Thanks', 'film', 're-release', 'one', 'finally', 'getting', 'respect', 'taken', '30+', 'years', 'now', 'acknowledged', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'influential', 'independent', 'filmmakers', 'time', ""'re"", 'interested', 'buy', 'Blu-Ray', 'immediately']",N/A
