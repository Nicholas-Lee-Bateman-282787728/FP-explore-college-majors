I guess I can see why it's raved about, but come on. You have to be completely in the dark about the real world to imagine this happening. And if it did, that the response of the US would be like this. Frankly, I'm amazed that it isn't panned as being completely naive and paranoid. But whatever, folks like it. Didn't watch Navy Seals at all. Tossed the dvd overboard after watching Red Dawn (was on my sailboat, had brought this to watch on my laptop). But I'm giving it 5-stars cuz I only do 5 or 1, love something or hate it, no in between. It's not a 1 so 5 is what it gets. Thought Swayze sucked in this, and would consider him a hack actor if not for Point Break with Keanu Reeves, one of the great movies of all time.",5,Wilfull suspension of common sense helps.,1270080000,"04 1, 2010",2010,824,"['Heard', 'Red', 'Dawn', 'forever', 'finally', 'bought', 'combo', '5', 'not', 'current', 'price', '17', 'guess', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'raved', 'come', 'have', 'be', 'completely', 'dark', 'real', 'world', 'imagine', 'happening', 'did', 'response', 'US', 'would', 'be', 'Frankly', ""'m"", 'amazed', ""n't"", 'panned', 'being', 'completely', 'naive', 'paranoid', 'whatever', 'folks', 'Did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'Navy', 'Seals', 'Tossed', 'dvd', 'overboard', 'watching', 'Red', 'Dawn', 'was', 'sailboat', 'had', 'brought', 'watch', 'laptop', ""'m"", 'giving', '5-stars', 'cuz', 'only', 'do', '5', '1', 'love', 'something', 'hate', 'not', '1', 'so', '5', 'what', 'Thought', 'Swayze', 'sucked', 'would', 'consider', 'hack', 'actor', 'not', 'Point', 'Break', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'one', 'great', 'movies', 'time']",Red Dawn / Navy Seals

Blackhawk Down is better though. Now to the GOOD one. RED DAWN IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES REGARDLESS OF CATEGORY, EVER. The opener should send chills down your spine because some of this HAS ALREADY HAPPENED. Cuban and Russian forces land on U.S. soil(you read that right) and take over about one state's worth of land. A small group of teenagers fight for their lives in the mountains with Cubans in military like gunfights. Tanks, grenades, machine guns, everything.
