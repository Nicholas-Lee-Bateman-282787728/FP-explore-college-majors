This movie may be blasphomous to diehard Nascar fans but was a non stop joyride for me.  The fun is all in watching these chracters play into the roles of redneck racers.  Although the movie pressed a slight message of teamwork the true fun came from watching Will Ferrell interact with Sacha Baron Cohen.

1024434,A2K3L0DOPQQ697,B000J3OTO6,"Andrew Olson ""otaku""","[1, 8]","As spunky Susan (Amy Adams) says, Ricky Bobby (Will Ferell) is not a thinker. Ricky Bobby is a driver. One day, during a race, Bobby replaces famed NASCAR racer Terry Cheveaux (Adam McKay) and finishes the race at 3rd. Regardless of that, he caught the eye of Carly (Leslie Bibb), a smokin'-hot woman who flashes him. Both got married, and live in a beautiful home with two kids (Houston Tumlin and Grayson Russell). Around this time, Bobby and childhood friend Cal (John C. Reilly) have perfected a technique called ""Shake and Bake,"" where the former shakes and the latter bakes. This helps Bobby win races. That may come to an end, when he meets competition in the form of flamboyant formula-one racer Jean Girrard (Sasha Baron Cohen).Back in 2004, Will Ferrell and director Adam McKay made a 90-minute SNL sketch, not on the sketch variety show, but on the silver screen. ""Anchorman"" was a hit with critics, but released at a bad time (""Spider-Man 2,"" anyone?). Well, the duo is back, moving from the news desk to the famous Talladega Superspeedway. This is ""Talladega Nights.""McKay and Ferrell (once again producing) have added some new twists to this comedy. Including keeping actors from hogging the camera for too long, ""Talladega Nights"" features plenty of NASCAR idiosyncrasies (including product placement from EA Sports to Power Ade), lots of redneck lampooning, and the idea of gay French men being part of a hard-boiled sport like this (once again, the artist formerly known as ""Ali G"" rocks the boat, this time with a hilarious French accent).Adam McKay also has a knack for directing good action scenes. But hey, you get famed cinematographer Oliver Wood (""The Bourne Identity"" and ""Face/Off""), anything's possible. Sure, some scenes look like they've been created with computers, but unlike ""Dukes of Hazzard"" and ""Taxi,"" they don't wear out their welcome. And there's a rockin' good soundtrack featuring tunes from Audioslave, AC/DC, Saliva, and many more.Of course, the movie still has a lot of actors ad-libbing their way through scenes. This is Will Ferrell's comedy, and unlike in ""Bewitched,"" McKay knows what works and what doesn't work. It's hit-and-miss, but Ferrell isn't as annoying. He even has good talent working with him, including some SNL alums (David Koechner, Rob Riggle, and Molly Shannon), award winners (Amy Adams and Michael Clarke Duncan), and Gary Cole and Jane Lynch as Ricky Bobby's parents. There are a good couple cameos from the real-life NASCAR drivers and announcers... but why waste Mos Def and Elvis Costello? I think they would've benefited from McKay's comedic direction. Oh well...I must say that after a couple of downers in 2005, it's great to see Will Ferrell back with his SNL writer-cum-director. And the actresses (including Leslie Bibb) are a joy even if they're not in the movie long enough (Molly Shannon, what the hell?). If you enjoyed ""Anchorman,"" by all means check out ""Talladega Nights."" Let's hope it makes bank.",5,buckle up!!!,1163808000,"11 18, 2006",2006,2981,"['spunky', 'Susan', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'Ricky', 'Bobby', 'Will', 'Ferell', 'not', 'thinker', 'Ricky', 'Bobby', 'driver', 'One', 'day', 'race', 'Bobby', 'famed', 'NASCAR', 'racer', 'Terry', 'Cheveaux', 'Adam', 'McKay', 'race', '3rd', 'Regardless', 'caught', 'eye', 'Carly', 'Leslie', 'Bibb', ""smokin'-hot"", 'woman', 'who', 'got', 'married', 'live', 'beautiful', 'home', 'two', 'kids', 'Houston', 'Tumlin', 'Grayson', 'Russell', 'time', 'Bobby', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Cal', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'have', 'perfected', 'technique', 'called', 'Shake', 'Bake', 'where', 'former', 'shakes', 'latter', 'bakes', 'Bobby', 'win', 'races', 'may', 'come', 'end', 'when', 'competition', 'form', 'flamboyant', 'formula-one', 'racer', 'Jean', 'Girrard', 'Sasha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', '.Back', '2004', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'director', 'Adam', 'McKay', 'made', '90-minute', 'SNL', 'sketch', 'not', 'sketch', 'variety', 'show', 'silver', 'screen', 'Anchorman', 'was', 'hit', 'critics', 'released', 'bad', 'time', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'anyone', 'Well', 'duo', 'back', 'moving', 'news', 'desk', 'famous', 'Talladega', 'Superspeedway', 'Talladega', 'Nights', 'McKay', 'Ferrell', 'once', 'again', 'producing', 'have', 'added', 'new', 'twists', 'comedy', 'Including', 'keeping', 'actors', 'hogging', 'camera', 'too', 'long', 'Talladega', 'Nights', 'plenty', 'NASCAR', 'idiosyncrasies', 'including', 'product', 'placement', 'EA', 'Sports', 'Power', 'Ade', 'lots', 'redneck', 'lampooning', 'idea', 'gay', 'French', 'men', 'being', 'part', 'hard-boiled', 'sport', 'once', 'again', 'artist', 'formerly', 'known', 'Ali', 'G', 'boat', 'time', 'hilarious', 'French', 'accent', '.Adam', 'McKay', 'also', 'knack', 'directing', 'good', 'action', 'scenes', 'hey', 'get', 'famed', 'cinematographer', 'Oliver', 'Wood', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'Face/Off', 'anything', 'possible', 'Sure', 'scenes', 'look', ""'ve"", 'been', 'created', 'computers', 'Dukes', 'Hazzard', 'Taxi', 'do', ""n't"", 'wear', 'out', 'welcome', 'rockin', 'good', 'soundtrack', 'featuring', 'tunes', 'Audioslave', 'AC/DC', 'Saliva', 'many', 'more.Of', 'course', 'movie', 'still', 'lot', 'actors', 'ad-libbing', 'way', 'scenes', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'comedy', 'Bewitched', 'McKay', 'what', 'what', ""n't"", 'work', 'hit-and-miss', 'Ferrell', ""n't"", 'annoying', 'even', 'good', 'talent', 'working', 'including', 'SNL', 'alums', 'David', 'Koechner', 'Rob', 'Riggle', 'Molly', 'Shannon', 'award', 'winners', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'Michael', 'Clarke', 'Duncan', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'Jane', 'Lynch', 'Ricky', 'Bobby', 'parents', 'are', 'good', 'couple', 'cameos', 'real-life', 'NASCAR', 'drivers', 'announcers', 'why', 'waste', 'Mos', 'Def', 'Elvis', 'Costello', 'think', 'would', ""'ve"", 'benefited', 'McKay', 'comedic', 'direction', 'Oh', 'well', 'must', 'say', 'couple', 'downers', '2005', 'great', 'see', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'back', 'SNL', 'writer-cum-director', 'actresses', 'including', 'Leslie', 'Bibb', 'are', 'joy', 'even', ""'re"", 'not', 'movie', 'long', 'enough', 'Molly', 'Shannon', 'what', 'hell', 'enjoyed', 'Anchorman', 'means', 'check', 'Talladega', 'Nights', 'Let', 'hope', 'bank']",N/A

Reilly), perfectly embody the stereotypical Southern lifestyle. Southern rock loving, gun toting, fast food munching doofs. With several championships under his belt, plus a hot wife Carley (Leslie Bibb) and a loving family, Ricky has it all.However, Ricky's life is about to get rocky with the introduction of homosexual French racing champion Jean Girard (the incredibly talented Sacha Baron Cohen), who is intent on overthrowing Ricky Bobby as champion. Ricky is determined on keeping his title, but when an accident leads to Rikcy into a state of psychosomatic shock and parayisis. While recupertaing in the hospital, Cal runs off with his wife, which puts an end to their friendship. After a few more mishaps, Ricky decided to quit Nascar, so he takes his two kids and goes to live with his mother. While there, Ricky meets up with his long estranged father, who are still unable to reconnect after all these years.However, things start to take a turn for the better when Ricky's crewmember Susan (Amy Adams) urges Ricky to get back in the race, rekindling his spark (as well as causing him to fall head over heels for her).At this pint, the film becomes predictable (though the final showdown between Bobby and Girard is unexpected and hilarious), but that does not stop ""Taladega Nights"" from becoming one of the funniest moives in recent years.

It's one big, dopey, low brow comedy - Applebee's commercial designed to appeal to our stupid-funny bone.

A spiteful gay French driver, a vindictive sponsor and Ricky's greedy wife help to bring the cocky oaf to the end of his rope.

There are those Will Ferrell fans out there that'll eat up TALLADEGA NIGHTS: THE BALLAD OF RICKY BOBBY.

But there is a third reason someone might enjoy this rather ridiculous film.Hopefully there are those movie goers out there that enjoy watching parodies of various lifestyles, and this is where Talladega Nights gets most of -- if not all of -- its comedic punch. That we witness a southern Nascar driver with all of his conservative leanings hanging out for everyone to see was absolutely hysterical. Ricky Bobby's (Will Ferrell) big house, multiple gas guzzling cars (Hummers, etc.), a wife who's gauged on breast quality, and two kids named after a horrible action series (""These are my kids, Walker and Texas Ranger"") are all over-exaggerations on conservative values; you wouldn't dare see one of them driving a hybrid car, for instance.The entrance of a homosexual Frenchman named Jean Girard (Sacha Baron Cohen, Borat) adds an additional element in the American prejudice category, Ricky Bobby bashing Girard's foreign heritage while making a fool of Americans' naivete (""America gave the world Chinese food!"")The challenge of Ricky Bobby to overcome his fear of driving after a horrendous crash is only minimalist humor added to the film.

I don't know if they even had a script for this movie, but it didn't matter; it's still very funny and has a more coherent plot than many things I've seen lately.  The deleted and extended scenes, and other extras, show a number of alternate takes for a number of scenes.  It appears that everyone just made up funny dialogue on the spot, and the scenes were assembled in the editing room based on what was funniest.  Poor Jenny McCarthy - she turns in a good performance, but you can see the fear in her eyes in some of the deleted scenes where she tries to get in the improv spirit and fails miserably.I agree with the reviewers who say this movie is overly long.  To its credit, they know that we know that Ricky Bobby is a big Nascar star in this movie, so they don't belabor the early days of his rise to fame, and we race through the exposition pretty quickly.

This movie is supposed to make you laugh, and it does.  I thought it was way better than Anchorman (the first Will Ferrell film I halfway liked).  Much of the movie was filmed near me in Charlotte, and I can briefly be seen in two scenes.  Even the patrons here enjoyed the movie for what it was...a spoof of sports movies and a spoof as well as a celebration of NASCAR culture.  The NASCAR fans I know were happy that the race scenes were mostly portrayed accurately unlike in Days of Thunder.  If you don't read much into the movie and just lose yourself in it, you will laugh at several scenes and lines.  The jokes are actually a little less childish for the most part and the supporting cast (Bibb, Shannon, Adams, and especially Cole) really make the movie.

1024450,A388ZDFVK72VCA,B000J3OTO6,"Cale E. Reneau ""Mound of Wires""","[5, 7]","Will Ferrell has always managed to be one of the funniest men alive. Much like his contemporary, Jack Black, Ferrell can transform himself into a wide array of characters and always manage to bring hoardes of laughs in the process. This skill he undoubtedly honed back in his SNL days, but it has been Ferrell's movie career that has truly made him one of the most admired comedians today. Whether its a drunken middle-aged frat boy, a swinging, jazz flute enthusiast anchorman, or a womanizing funeral crasher, Will Ferrell always delivers! In ""Talladega Nights,"" the comedian continues this trend and propels his stardom further into [insert clever noun here] than ever before.Knowing that this is movie comes about courtesy of essentially the same group of people that gave us ""Anchorman,"" should get anyone with a sense of humor excited about this movie. Like that film, ""Talladega Nights"" puts Ferrell in the role of a character so dumb, its likely impossible to out-dumb him. Ricky Bobby is a man who, from his infancy, wants to ""go fast."" In a chance occurrence, he gets his opportunity one day at a NASCAR race when, as a member of a pit crew, he is called upon to finish the race for a slothful driver. A few years, and a 2-minute montage, later, Ricky Bobby is the #1 driver in all of NASCAR, complete with a hot wife, two wise-cracking children, a mansion, and a couple million dollars to spare. However, at the height of his career, a new French teamate, played by Sacha Baron Cohen, threatens to steal his glory and dethrone him as king of NASCAR.Sure, the plot may come across as a bit bland (and, in all honesty, typical), but if anyone can make this work its Ferrell. Add in the brilliant comedic performances of John C. Reilly and Michael Clarke Duncan, and ""Talladega Nights"" will far surpass any expectations of mediocracy that you may have. In fact, there's not a whole lot not to love about this movie. Ferrell practically makes every scene he's in worth watching, and his character's often-dry quibs will keep you chuckling consistently. The only thing that hurts this movie is Cohen's performance of a gay, French, Formula 1-turned-NASCAR driver. For once, he fails in portraying a foreign stereotype, largely because his portrayal of the character is so utterly obnoxious that you'll be beggin for him to get off the screen. Even scenes in which he and Ferrell exchange humorous jabs fail, largely because of Cohen's presence. It is a potentially funny role, but Cohen makes it absolutely unbearable.In the end, ""Talladega Nights"" succeeds not because of the plot, but the comedic performances of the majority of the cast, who, except Cohen, perfectly play their roles. Like most Will Ferrell movies, there is enough comedic material here to warrant repeat-views, and a DVD purchase. Hell, any movie that can reference ""Manimal"" and mention butt cheek-spreading can't be all that bad can it?The answer is ""no.""

He was a constant highlight of any SNL episode he appeared on, and has portrayed many memorable characters.Ricky Bobby is not one of them.I had such high hopes for this film, and while there were certainly some funny moments (it's Will Ferrell, how could there not be?) I still found myself getting a little bored. There are only so many beer drinking NASCAR hillbilly jokes a person can take. After a while it just gets a little tediously redundant. The funniest moments were all shown on the preview, so in theory you could have just watched the preview and not miss much. I guess it doesn't help that I'm not much of a Sacha Baron Cohen fan either.On the plus side, I do have to say that ""Talladega Nights"" was definitely better than Will Ferrell's other recent projects, inlcuding ""Bewitched"" and ""Kicking and Screaming"". It's a step in the right direction, so hopefully he'll be able to turn out another classic comedy like ""Old School"" and ""Anchorman"" pretty soon. I've got my fingers crossed.It's a funny movie if you're in the mood for a little stupidity, because there is certainly an abundance of *that* in this film.

With regard to this film specifically, while it promises to be funny (and, on occassion, it genuinely IS), but this premise is sadly detracted by one-too-many subplots and an uneven sense of pacing, coupled with an almost mad-cap desire to throw out one too many catch-phrases. In short, it tries to be too many things at once and ultimately ends up being little more than nothing.

Speaking of which, Will Ferrell might want to read the screen plays before he decides to do movies like these. I understand he is trying to be funny, but there was barely anything funny here. There are some parts in this movie that was so stupid, that it would be funny. I laugh at a lot of things in life, but I even know when something is isn't funny and it just plain dumb.There are some (limited) funny parts here in this movie, but the trick is to be able to sit long enough to wait for them that are spread out within the movie.

I'll admit when a film did make me laugh but most of the times the film had an inoffensive air around it so it made it seem funny even though there was nothing just laugh-out-loud hilarious. While problematic in parts, Talladega Nights is probably one of those films where there's bound to be something that at least makes you laugh hard once.Ricky Bobby grew up with an unconventional father who taught him that winning is the best thing ever. Ricky loves racing so he combines the two and wants to become the best racecar driver ever. With the help of his friend Cal, his wife Carly and a misfit team, Ricky does become quite successful until gay French rival Jean Girard shows up and not only humiliates him in a bar but actually is better. Things get out of hand in a huge car crash and Ricky has to regain his footing again and become the best driver at NASCAR.Like I said earlier, there's bound to be at least something that makes you laugh, if only because like most comedies, they fire everything they have in the hopes that at least something will be funny among the numerous jokes. Some are repeated way too often (to paraphrase Stewie's jackal rant, that whole ""Shake and Bake"" thing wasn't funny the first time, why the hell would it be funny the next 10 times) but then there's some winners like a discussions about crepes, France's flat version of a pancake or a prayer involving Baby Jesus, not Bearded Jesus or Teenage Jesus but an 8-pounder Jesus.Casting is pretty spot-on although John C. Reilly is actually the surprise in that he's actually pretty likable and funny even though he's quite the intellectually challenged shall we say. And Sacha Baron Cohen (of Borat and the irritating Da Ali G Show) is quite hilarious as the gay French rival. It's also got some pretty great car racing scenes and some pretty brutal looking crashes but the emphasis is on Ricky getting back into racing so it's not packed with speeding cars but then some stuff in a way doesn't work like Ricky's sons Walker and Texas Ranger (I'm not kidding) who are basically little devil kids who become nice and Ricky's uncaring dad. Kudos for having Leslie Bibb and Amy Adams play the women though (despite my actual thought that it was Brianna Lynn Brown and not Adams playing that role, strange).If you liked Anchorman, I'm sure you'll love this.

1024468,AUHG8KSHI529U,B000J3OTO6,Craig Matteson,"[2, 2]","This is a very funny movie.  At points, its crudity goes beyond my taste, but I can live through them to enjoy the rest of the jokes.  Will Ferrell as Ricky Bobby is certainly the point of the film, but his performance is only one of the thrill rides in this amusement park.  Let's start with Gary Cole and Jane Lynch as Ricky's parents, Reese and Lucy Bobby.  They set the perfect tone for the film in the opening scene racing towards (and past) the hospital when she is just about to give birth to our hero.  Reese has some wonderful moments in the film, such as the career day appearance when Ricky is in grade school, or the family dinner at Applebee's that is going so well that it makes him uncomfortable.  Or what about the time that he finally goes to pick up the pair of tickets that Ricky has been leaving for him at every race for years (that the ticket sellers resell and pocket the cash)?When Ricky is down so low that he has to go live with his mom, Lucy is masterful with his ratbag kids and provides some of the great fun in the film.  She is a terrific character.  John C. Reilly is perfect as Ricky's best friend, Cal Naughton, Jr. and is the anchor that provides a foundation that allows Ferrell to soar as Ricky.  Cal is the one that came up with their ""Shake and Bake"" slogan and is willing to always come in second to Ricky's first.  Until he can't anymore.  His finding out that being on top isn't exactly what he was looking for in life is even a bit touching.Leslie Bibb provides the right amount of babeness and avaricious romance to the film as she claims Ricky and then Cal when Ricky can't get her what she wants anymore (and in neither case is it the man).  Carley is a tough role to get just right because we have to like her, maybe even attracted to her, and yet she has to be a bit creepy.Greg German and Molly Shannon as the team owners (the Denits) also get their roles just right.  Larry Denit is a hateful, and we gather impotent, owner who got the racing team from Daddy and resents everyone on the team who is able to do things he can't do except for the money he got from his pa.  Mrs. Dennit is fully aware of the ridiculous situation and takes her comfort from booze, from flirting with Denit's big ticket customers, and the vibrations of the track as the cars zoom by.Sacha Baron Cohen as Jean Girard is most everyone's delight in the film.  And while it is a whacky character that helps Ricky Bobby to get even weirder, I thought the accent was so awkward and the emphasis on his being gay so over done that I found the role to be a net negative.  However, that is just me and I recognize that others think this guy is a comedy genius.  And I know that taking risks means at times doing things that don't work.  I am not saying the Girard role doesn't work, but I didn't find it wonderful.  Weird isn't wonderful or brilliant.  It is just weird.While Will Ferrell gets a lot of attention for running around in his underwear or less, for me the perfect moments in the film were his first interview with the ESPN guy, the scene at the bar with Susan (Amy Adams), and learning to drive again with his dad.  That and the knife in the leg scene at the hospital with Lucius (Michael Clark Duncan) and Cal.A pretty funny movie that people will laugh with for a long time.",4,Very funny movie with some very special performances,1183766400,"07 7, 2007",2007,3308,"['very', 'funny', 'movie', 'points', 'crudity', 'taste', 'can', 'live', 'enjoy', 'rest', 'jokes', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'Ricky', 'Bobby', 'certainly', 'point', 'film', 'performance', 'only', 'one', 'thrill', 'amusement', 'park', 'Let', 'start', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'Jane', 'Lynch', 'Ricky', 'parents', 'Reese', 'Lucy', 'Bobby', 'set', 'perfect', 'tone', 'film', 'opening', 'scene', 'racing', 'towards', 'past', 'hospital', 'when', 'just', 'about', 'give', 'birth', 'hero', 'Reese', 'wonderful', 'moments', 'film', 'such', 'career', 'day', 'appearance', 'when', 'Ricky', 'grade', 'school', 'family', 'dinner', 'Applebee', 'going', 'so', 'well', 'uncomfortable', 'what', 'time', 'finally', 'pick', 'up', 'pair', 'tickets', 'Ricky', 'been', 'leaving', 'race', 'years', 'ticket', 'sellers', 'resell', 'pocket', 'cash', 'When', 'Ricky', 'down', 'so', 'low', 'go', 'live', 'mom', 'Lucy', 'masterful', 'ratbag', 'kids', 'great', 'fun', 'film', 'terrific', 'character', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'perfect', 'Ricky', 'best', 'friend', 'Cal', 'Naughton', 'Jr.', 'anchor', 'foundation', 'Ferrell', 'soar', 'Ricky', 'Cal', 'one', 'came', 'up', 'Shake', 'Bake', 'slogan', 'willing', 'always', 'come', 'second', 'Ricky', 'first', 'ca', ""n't"", 'anymore', 'finding', 'out', 'being', 'top', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'looking', 'life', 'even', 'bit', 'touching.Leslie', 'Bibb', 'right', 'amount', 'babeness', 'avaricious', 'romance', 'film', 'Ricky', 'then', 'Cal', 'when', 'Ricky', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'what', 'anymore', 'case', 'man', 'Carley', 'tough', 'role', 'get', 'just', 'right', 'have', 'like', 'maybe', 'even', 'attracted', 'yet', 'be', 'bit', 'creepy.Greg', 'German', 'Molly', 'Shannon', 'team', 'owners', 'Denits', 'also', 'get', 'roles', 'just', 'right', 'Larry', 'Denit', 'hateful', 'gather', 'impotent', 'owner', 'who', 'got', 'racing', 'team', 'Daddy', 'resents', 'everyone', 'team', 'who', 'able', 'do', 'things', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'except', 'money', 'got', 'pa.', 'Mrs.', 'Dennit', 'fully', 'aware', 'ridiculous', 'situation', 'comfort', 'booze', 'flirting', 'Denit', 'big', 'ticket', 'customers', 'vibrations', 'track', 'cars', 'zoom', 'by.Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'Jean', 'Girard', 'most', 'everyone', 'delight', 'film', 'whacky', 'character', 'Ricky', 'Bobby', 'get', 'even', 'weirder', 'thought', 'accent', 'was', 'so', 'awkward', 'emphasis', 'being', 'gay', 'so', 'done', 'found', 'role', 'be', 'net', 'negative', 'However', 'just', 'recognize', 'others', 'think', 'guy', 'comedy', 'genius', 'know', 'taking', 'risks', 'times', 'doing', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'am', 'not', 'saying', 'Girard', 'role', ""n't"", 'work', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'wonderful', 'Weird', ""n't"", 'wonderful', 'brilliant', 'just', 'weird.While', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'lot', 'attention', 'running', 'around', 'underwear', 'less', 'perfect', 'moments', 'film', 'were', 'first', 'interview', 'ESPN', 'guy', 'scene', 'bar', 'Susan', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'learning', 'drive', 'again', 'dad', 'knife', 'leg', 'scene', 'hospital', 'Lucius', 'Michael', 'Clark', 'Duncan', 'Cal.A', 'pretty', 'funny', 'movie', 'people', 'will', 'laugh', 'long', 'time']",N/A

With ""Talladega Nights"" though,every time you expect a lame & cliche moral with a soft & puffy texture to be thrown into the mix they do a 180 on you by throwing in a nonsensical ludicrous & sometimes down right offensive but hilarious joke or situation rolled up in a big ball of stupidity wich inturn tickles the funnybone of any viewer just looking for a careless laugh such as myself.

He's religious without any understanding of God, he wants to drive fast without any understanding of society, he likes sex without any understanding of women, and he doesn't even understand himself.  In all that it's a really well done shot at a segment of America that some of us frequently make fun much of the time.  I wonder how many of them got it.On top of all that, it includes a pretty complex plot filled with subtleties which add some strength to the parody itself.  Ricky Bobby's relationship with his absentee father is an intricate commentary on Southern attitudes toward family and gives some comedic motivation to Ricky Bobby's actions.  Another aspect of the character building is the all good/all bad relationship he has with his best friend, showing the black and white world of morality that exists in that lifestyle.It was a fast film, like a fast race, moving the story along with plenty of sight gags and one liners.

I personally think he is one of the funniest men in work today, and he never fails to impress me. That said, `Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby' is one of his funniest most entertaining films and is sure to please any fan of Ferrell. As Ricky Bobby, Ferrell plays a man obsessed with going fast. The first few minutes of the film introduce you to his loser father whose only words of advise to his young son are ""if your not first, your last"" and that's the motto Ricky's lived by his whole life. Twenty-five years later and he is first in every race, his best friend Cal (Reilly who is just as funny as Ferrell) always coming in second place.When Jean Girard (Cohen), a gay French racer, comes to take Bobby's spot at the top things turn ugly, and when a stroke of bad luck hits our hero he's left at the bottom, his `smoking hot wife' Carley (Leslie Bibb) leaving him for Cal and taking his house sending him to live with his mother (Jane Lynch) and his two hellion children Walker (Houston Tumlin) and Texas Ranger (Grayson Russell). With the help of his father Reese (Gary Cole) Ricky is able to regain his passion for the race and regain his place at the top.With non-stop laughs provided by the entire cast, not just the always hilarious Ferrell, but everyone from Reilly to Michael Clarke Duncan and Amy Adams and Molly Shannon (who plays a priceless drunk!), this makes for one brilliant ensemble film With one liners that will live as long as ""you my boy Blue"" and moments that will go down as the funniest we've seen from this brilliant SNL alumni, Ferrell has cemented himself as one of our most talented comedians, and he can now add writer to his resume, for he shows great chops with this script. I haven't been this entertained in quite a long time. Forget Pirates, this is the summer blockbuster...best I've seen this year!~I wanted to mention on the DVD itself, there are quite a few GREAT extras, like Will's commentary which is hysterical, a gag real which is worth its weight and a bunch of random scenes with random lines that didn't make it into the movie.

Yes, he was funny on SNL given the very limited playing time of sketch comedy.  But this is feature film land here and he just isn't very funny over a 2-hour feature length film.  My favorite part of the film was Gary Cole as Ricky Bobby's daddy.  I don't think this man gets enough credit.

Each draws a completely different audience, each dismissive of the demographics of the race that came just before theirs and the one that comes after.That's the dynamic upon which Ferrell's Rick Bobby and Sacha Baron Cohen's irrepressible F1 convert to Nascar Jean Girard play. They rightly play to howls of laughter.Ferrell's and John Reilly's Cal Naughton, Jr. (even the name is perfect) hilariously draw out the bisyllables of Southern Fried culture.

Ricky Bobby (Will Farrell) is a born race car driver who becomes a champion, until an accident leaves him psychologically unable to race again. John C. Reilly plays his sidekick, always coming in second, helping Ricky Bobby win. Will Farrell's over-the-top goofiness was toned town a bit--a small bit, which for me made the movie funnier, because I was laughing at the lines and situations rather than at Will Farrell.NASCAR is lavishly lampooned, but in such an extravagant and good-humored way that I doubt fans would be offended--the movie takes the stereotypes and runs with them. And there are a couple of subplots that keep the movie interesting--Ricky Bobby's kids are uncontrolled brats until his mother takes them in hand; he has to deal with betrayal and the consequences of his treatment of his best friend; there's love lost and found; and the commitment-phobic father who set him on the path to racing returns to put him back on track (heh. pun. sorry.) with hilarious training tactics.Jane Lynch and Gary Cole as Ricky Bobby's parents have the best roles, I think--funny, but low-key. The kids were over-the-top both when they were obnoxious and when they were reformed, but that, oddly enough, kept them from getting on my nerves.We watched this with our sons, ages 12 & 16, and there were a couple of sexual references, but nothing that made me cringe.

This is a racing story Will Ferrell style, and I like it!!To be sure, this is the funniest movie I've seen in awhile.  I thought it would be hilarious from the theatrical previews & I was not disappointed.  According to other reviewers, they actually deleted a few key scenes from the theatrical release.  I never saw the original, but it sounds like that was a poor decision.  Typically, ""uncut"" means they ADDED a few scenes, not deleted them!The film would have gotten a 5 Star rating from me except for the fact that, unlike most unrated Will Ferrell flicks, this one omitted the obligatory gratuitous nudity.  This fact is a particular shame in this film as Leslie Bibb and Amy Adams are both SMOKIN' hot - AND they had plenty of opportunities for some tittilating sequences if they wanted to put them in.  Hence, those expecting some topless girls to be thrown into the uncut version (as was the case withWedding Crashers - Uncorked (Unrated Full Screen Edition)will be disappointed.  This is basically a PG-13 ditty with a few swear words added - that's it.While they didn't get the nudity part right, they did get the comedy part on the $$.

If you aren't much of a Will Ferrell fan then you will probably agree. Don't get me wrong, there are tons of comical moments in this film, but some of the bits are overdone, and since they weren't that great to begin with they become annoying the longer they are carried out. The ""invisible fire"" for example, though seeing Ferrell run around in his underwear is pretty comical. Why does he tend to run around naked or underwear-clad in most of his movies anyway?Not having checked the credits before watching the film, I was pleasantly surprised to see Sacha Baron Cohen starring as the villain, converted Formula Un driver Jean Girard. His was a comical performance, though he seemed to overdo the accent, sounding almost as if he litterally had peanut butter in his mouth. But I think that was the whole idea.There are several subplots and story lines: Ricky Bobby (come on, you're laughing. If that isn't the funniest name I've heard in years...) and his relationship with his father, his self-esteem, his out of control children being conformed into well-behaved boys by their strict grandmother, losing his wife to best friend and fellow team racer Cal Naughton, Jr. All of these stories are woven into the plot.I'm not a huge Will Ferrell fan to begin with, so I think I may have been biased from the beginning.

He didn't only lose his racing career but his best buddy ""the awesome John C. Reilly"" stole his wife. Cole helps him out in the funniest ways. I mean one scene has him telling Ricky to drive away quick because he taped cocaine on the bottom of the car and called the cops. This movie is just great fun and it's hard not to laugh watching it when everyone in it is actually funny. Michael Clarke Duncan is even more lively than ever as Farrell's racing coach. While John C. Reilly and Gary Cole ""especially Cole"" are so good here in supporting roles that I wish comedy roles got nominated a lot more. Reilly can handle any type of role whether it's comedy or drama and he's a great partner for Farrell here. He was Ricky's bestfriend since childhood and loves him but is jealous that he  has to help Ricky win but Ricky never helps him win.Even it's uncalled for  jokes are hard not to laugh at even if they are wrong. Sure Ricky's kids curse a lot and he taught them to tell off their grandfather and it may have been wrong to laugh but.... I laughed. I may also go to hell for laughing at how Ricky prefers praying to baby jesus but....I laughed. Stuff like that may make the movie sound overly offensive but it's not really. It's actually a smart movie with some charm and has a better script than most Adam Sandler comedies ""maybe even all Adam Sandler comedies"". I usually think the summer is dead once August hits but this movie really caught me by surprise. It's a ton of fun and one of Will Farrell's best movies. It's certainly way better than any of his comedies that he made last year.",4,The Fast and Hilarious,1154649600,"08 4, 2006",2006,2263,"['felt', 'pretty', 'stupid', 'watching', 'movie', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'laughing', 'racing', 'comedy', 'racing', 'scenes', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'done', 'cast', 'great', 'together', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'hilarious', 'Ricky', 'Bobby', 'who', 'just', 'go', 'fast', 'not', 'surprising', 'became', 'fast', 'rising', 'racing', 'star', 'father', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'great', 'comic', 'form', 'appeared', 'once', 'childhood', 'just', 'give', 'one', 'piece', 'advice', ""'re"", 'not', 'first', ""'re"", 'last', 'So', 'Ricky', 'heald', 'piece', 'advice', 'entire', 'life.After', 'racing', 'accident', 'afraid', 'driving', 'fast', 'father', 'finally', 'back', 'life', 'try', 'get', 'back', 'feet', 'did', ""n't"", 'only', 'lose', 'racing', 'career', 'best', 'buddy', 'awesome', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'stole', 'wife', 'Cole', 'out', 'funniest', 'ways', 'mean', 'one', 'scene', 'telling', 'Ricky', 'drive', 'away', 'quick', 'taped', 'cocaine', 'bottom', 'car', 'called', 'cops', 'movie', 'just', 'great', 'fun', 'hard', 'not', 'watching', 'when', 'everyone', 'actually', 'funny', 'Michael', 'Clarke', 'Duncan', 'even', 'more', 'lively', 'ever', 'Farrell', 'racing', 'coach', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'especially', 'Cole', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'here', 'supporting', 'roles', 'wish', 'comedy', 'roles', 'got', 'nominated', 'lot', 'more', 'Reilly', 'can', 'handle', 'type', 'role', 'comedy', 'drama', 'great', 'partner', 'Farrell', 'here', 'was', 'Ricky', 'bestfriend', 'childhood', 'jealous', 'help', 'Ricky', 'win', 'Ricky', 'never', 'win.Even', 'uncalled', 'jokes', 'are', 'hard', 'not', 'laugh', 'even', 'are', 'wrong', 'Sure', 'Ricky', 'kids', 'curse', 'lot', 'taught', 'tell', 'off', 'grandfather', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'wrong', 'laugh', 'laughed', 'may', 'also', 'go', 'hell', 'laughing', 'how', 'Ricky', 'prefers', 'praying', 'baby', 'jesus', '.I', 'laughed', 'Stuff', 'may', 'make', 'movie', 'sound', 'overly', 'offensive', 'not', 'really', 'actually', 'smart', 'movie', 'charm', 'better', 'script', 'most', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'maybe', 'even', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'comedies', 'usually', 'think', 'summer', 'dead', 'once', 'August', 'hits', 'movie', 'really', 'caught', 'surprise', 'ton', 'fun', 'one', 'Will', 'Farrell', 'best', 'movies', 'certainly', 'way', 'better', 'comedies', 'made', 'last', 'year']",N/A

In fact, sometimes he gets on my nerves. I had to turn off the Legend of Ron Burgundy off after twenty minutes because I found his character so incredibly unfunny so when my friend brought this over to the house for us to watch, I was really surprised at how much I laughed during this movie.Ricky Bobby was born to race. His daddy told him when he was young that if ""you ain't first, you're last."" Ricky Bobby takes this to heart and soul and becomes one of the greatest NASCAR legends ever. And then he crashes. Literally and as well as figuratively. And once he crashes, he loses everything; his hot wife, his best friend, but most importantly, he loses his ability to be fearless.There is a hilarious scene where Ricky Bobby thinks he's paralyzed from the race down wants to prove to his friends that it's not all in his head; that he is paralyzed. So he takes a knife and ----oh, you'll just have to see it. In typical Will Ferrell fashion, it's odd and yet amusing.But Ricky Bobby, with the help of his low-life dad, his momma, and a new lady in his life regains his confidence and goes out to race once more. Racing against the same Frenchman (played by Sacha Cohen) where he had his fateful accident, he wants to prove himself to his family, his friends, his fans, and to himself that he truly can pick up the pieces and win.Many times in life we lose, we fail, we become dissapointed, but the only time we really lose is when we stay down on the ground; when we let our fear conquer us rather than us conquering our fears. This movie may have been silly and corny, but in a very amusing way, it shows us that we're not truly beaten until we give up.Never give up.

What is Bowling for Movies in the first place??  It's a score that I, just your average dude, have come up with to rate and score movies.  I gotta lot time on my hands and I watch movies - many MANY movies.  Using the latest technology and a mixture of pseudo and quasi science, I have developed a formula (which literally has nothing to do with bowling) to capture the pure essence of Hollywood magic... displayed as a score ranging from 0 to 300.  A score of 108 would be a ""just ok, not particularly good / bad"" movie, where a score of 192 would tell you it was a very good movie.  Now, break 200 and you've got something really special.  Throw too many ""gutterballs"" will land you under 100 and well - you get the idea. :]Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby - we own (and cherish) the DVD version - soon to be upgraded to Blu RayMovie Explanation (no-there is too much, let me GO FAST):This is a heartwarming rags to riches, back to rags, and back to riches story.  Ricky Bobby, born in the back of a 1969 Chevy Malibu, was placed on this earth for just one thing - to GO FAST, real fast.  Even the absence of his good for nothing semi-pro race car driving father (who does tattoos on the side) wasn't going to keep him down.  Chanting the motto ""If you're not first, you're last"" Ricky Bobby grows into a man with a need - a need for speed.  When opportunity knocks, Bobby answers the door and quickly becomes a NASCAR star.  But its not all line dancing and champagne as Bobby faces a tragic accident (complete with invisible fire), the loss of his marriage, and the reemergence of a well-meaning slacker father.  Can Ricky fight his way back - cougar like - to the top of the pack?  What a high-octane ride for sure.Absolutely, this is by far the BEST rags to riches, back to rags, and back to riches story I can remember watching.  The cars are hot and the girls are quick but by the end of the movie a shallow race car driver learns some important life lessons, some obnoxious (and ill named) children learn to behave, a shy assistant learns to stand up for what she wants, the owner of Dennit Racing learns he's made a poor choice in spouses (or is it the other way around), and a French formula one driver learns what it takes to succeed in life and the American racing scene.  Who could have guessed there would be that much learning in a Will Ferrell movie?  It's like home schooling in the driver's seat of a muscle car.What I loved:-  Will Ferrell meets John C. Reilly - two great comedians that make you laugh when they are together-  The spoofing of the racing world is spot on - and you don't need to be a fan to get the jokes-  Well-acted with plenty of character development, you show up for the yuck yucks but there is an actual story to carry you thruWhat I did NOT like:-  There are a few places where the story bogs down a bit but there is always another joke or plot point around the corner to get it going againHey, if you have a question about this review, feel free to leave a comment and I will try to answer promptly.

1024520,A27CHILBK6HIL2,B000J3OTO6,Kaya Savas,"[14, 35]","MOVIE: Will Ferrell is probably the most bankable comedian working in film right now. Anchorman was a huge success and it a pretty funny movie as well. Here we have a movie about a NASCAR driver and his journey to the top. The movie is funny and it has all the Ferrell antics we've come to expect. However, I really felt like Will Ferrell wasn't that funny in the movie. It was his costars that made the film enjoyable, and even then it wasn't as funny as his previous ones. John C. Reilly is an incredible comedic actor, and he displays that here in the movie. The show is stolen by Sacha Baron Cohen who plays eccentric French Formula ""oohn"" driver, Jean Gerrard. The man is one of the most talented comedians ever to grace the screen, and he truly makes the film what it is. Will Ferrell may have you rolling when he sticks a knife in his leg, but the show's one-liners come from Cohen.ACTING: As I stated earlier, Ferrell and Reilly are extremely funny and talented, but Sacha Baron Cohen steals the spotlight. I laughed the hardest at his character just because he did such a perfect job. People will recognize Cohen as Ali G and Borat, as well as King Julian from Madagascar. The man is extremely veristile and he can transform into anything. Would you have guessed he's from Great Britain?BOTTOM LINE: A fun summer fare that will be one of those movies you pop in every now and then for a quick laugh.

1024522,A2YQ5O6XV23543,B000J3OTO6,Kevin H. Dudley,"[159, 167]","Talladega Nights is a very, very funny movie that spoofs Nascar without actually making fun of it and its fans.  In fact, this movie can actually appeal to people who don't even care for Nascar.Will Ferrel teamed back up with Adam McKay (the duo who produced/made the great Anchorman) to make this story that plays a lot like if Days of Thunder had been approached as a comedy instead of a dead serious (and unintentionally funny) film.While other people are focusing on the film itself, I would like to focus on the this whole mess of the PG-13 theatrical cut being released in wide and full screen along with (what is unfortunately a common practice) a ""UNRATED/UNCUT"" versions that boasts ""13 additional minutes of footage"".Now, for one thing, the theatrical cut was 108 minutes and actually could have used some more tightening. This is a 100 minute movie at most. I don't have a problem with people putting footage back into a DVD version of a movie if it's stuff that belongs and actually makes the movie better.This is a case, in which it doesn't.  The additional 13 minutes cause some scenes that were funny in the theatrical cut to drag on until they're at an interminable length in some cases. The added footage actually dilutes the humor in places.-------------------------------------------------------------------------But the alarming thing about this so called ""UNCUT"" version is that the movie actually ELIMINATES A FEW MEMORABLE SCENES THAT WERE PRESENT IN THE THEATRICAL CUT.  The scene in which a young Ricky steals his mom's car while she's in a convenience store is gone, which totally destroys the whole part in which Ricky volunteers to drive his team's car by saying ""I wanna to go fast"".Also, the scene in which Ricky calls Lucious at Lucios' car wash to tell him he's racing again at Talladega is gone as well.  This scene showed just what Lucious and his pit crew had been up to during Ricky's hiatus from racing.--------------------------------------------------------------------------If they had left everything in the theatrical cut and just added footage, I maybe could have lived with it. But the fact that they cut footage out is a travesty and false advertising to people who loved the movie in theaters.Most of the added footage just grinds the movie to a halt and like I mentioned before, as funny as the movie is, it was still about 8 minutes too long even in the theatrical cut.There are very few cases in which I feel that an extended version of a movie was superior (lord of the rings trilogy, 40 year old virgin) and in most cases it's just a case of DVD producers putting out an early cut or something of a movie that was tweaked after the fact during test screenings.  This is how the unrated cut of Talladega Nights comes across.So, if you loved the movie in theaters, just stick with the PG-13 theatrical widescreen cut.  If you haven't seen the movie before, I would see this cut first before testing out the unrated cut.  Many will share the same opinion that I have about this.I'm really sick of pointless ""unrated"" cuts coming out that just shoe horn back in footage that was taken out for a good reason to begin with.",4,Theatrical PG-13 cut is great.

To our surprise, Frabk Hoyt Taylor, who memorably played the fiery, pathetic old ""outsider artist"" specializing in crudely drawn portraits of Civil War genitals, was said to feature in TALLADEGA also.  Well so there we were and for a few minutes we might almost have been watching JUNEBUG 2, for the first movie ends with a young couple reuniting after some disputes, driving down a long Southern highway in the moonlight, while TALLADEGA NIGHTS opens up with Gary Cole and Jane Lynch driving down a lonesome road, but after that the two pictures veer wildly, and to tell you the truth, Amy Adams was admirable in JUNEBUG, but lousy in this one, and as for crazy old Frank Hoyt Tayler, we never did spot him!  Even his own mother, if he had one, would be hard pressed to pick him out to the sea of hillbilly humanity that is THE BALLAD OF RICKY BOBBY.The love story, and that's stretching it, is supposed to be a little like the one in THE SURE THING, where our hero is so knocked out by the sensual appeal of his dream girl, that he doesn't notice that his plain little girl pal is really the one for him.  That's a hard part to play, the caterpillar who becomes a butterfly when she pulls her T-shirt up over her chest, and Amy Adams does it as if under protest, gritting her teeth and despising herself and her agents for allowing her to undergo what Meryl Streep never had to.  That said, the movie is hilarious and the other girl, Leslie Bibb, seems to glory in being dumb as a post, like the ex-wife in MY NAME IS EARL, she is having some serious fun.When Ricky Bobby has to choose between the two girls, and chooses the caterpillar over the sex bomb, the movie deflates a little, like a tire what picked up a rusty ole nail.",3,Adams Chronicles,1181088000,"06 6, 2007",2007,1879,"['liked', 'JUNEBUG', 'so', 'much', 'consulted', 'IMDB', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'was', 'up', 'next', 'database', 'out', 'name', 'TALLADEGA', 'NIGHTS', 'surprise', 'Frabk', 'Hoyt', 'Taylor', 'who', 'memorably', 'played', 'fiery', 'pathetic', 'old', 'outsider', 'artist', 'specializing', 'crudely', 'drawn', 'portraits', 'Civil', 'War', 'genitals', 'was', 'said', 'feature', 'TALLADEGA', 'also', 'Well', 'so', 'were', 'few', 'minutes', 'might', 'almost', 'have', 'been', 'watching', 'JUNEBUG', '2', 'first', 'movie', 'young', 'couple', 'reuniting', 'disputes', 'driving', 'down', 'long', 'Southern', 'highway', 'moonlight', 'TALLADEGA', 'NIGHTS', 'up', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'Jane', 'Lynch', 'driving', 'down', 'lonesome', 'road', 'two', 'pictures', 'veer', 'wildly', 'tell', 'truth', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'was', 'admirable', 'JUNEBUG', 'lousy', 'one', 'crazy', 'old', 'Frank', 'Hoyt', 'Tayler', 'never', 'did', 'spot', 'Even', 'own', 'mother', 'had', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'pick', 'out', 'sea', 'hillbilly', 'humanity', 'BALLAD', 'OF', 'RICKY', 'BOBBY.The', 'love', 'story', 'stretching', 'supposed', 'be', 'little', 'one', 'SURE', 'THING', 'where', 'hero', 'so', 'knocked', 'out', 'sensual', 'appeal', 'dream', 'girl', ""n't"", 'notice', 'plain', 'little', 'girl', 'pal', 'really', 'one', 'hard', 'part', 'play', 'caterpillar', 'who', 'butterfly', 'when', 'T-shirt', 'up', 'chest', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'protest', 'gritting', 'teeth', 'despising', 'agents', 'allowing', 'undergo', 'what', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'never', 'had', 'said', 'movie', 'hilarious', 'other', 'girl', 'Leslie', 'Bibb', 'glory', 'being', 'dumb', 'post', 'ex-wife', 'MY', 'NAME', 'IS', 'EARL', 'having', 'serious', 'fun.When', 'Ricky', 'Bobby', 'choose', 'two', 'girls', 'caterpillar', 'sex', 'bomb', 'movie', 'little', 'tire', 'what', 'picked', 'up', 'rusty', 'ole', 'nail']",N/A
1024524,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B000J3OTO6,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[2, 8]","""Talladega Nights"" isn't the worst film out there, but it isn't the funniest either.  Will Ferrell can execute some very funny moments in his films, especially in ""Elf.""  However, when he's given free reign in a film, as he was in this and also in ""Anchorman,"" Ferrell seems to skip the part about trying to be funny and attempts to be all out silly.  This leaves the viewer wondering why much of the dialogue between his character and the rest in the film often makes no sense whatsoever.In ""Talladega Nights,"" Ferrell plays Ricky Bobby, an idiot who ""wants to go fast"" and lives by the code his deadbeat father gave him at career day in his school:  ""If you're not first, you're last.""  With this standard in tow, Ricky becomes the top racer in NASCAR, thanks to the help of his best friend, Cal Naughton, Jr. (John C. Reilly).  In the wings, however, is one Jean Girard (Sasha Baron Cohen), a Formula One racer who is determined to take over NASCAR and eliminate Ricky Bobby.  Well, that's what seems to be Girard motive, but there is another reason he is in NASCAR that is revealed later in the film.  After a terrible accident, Ricky Bobby loses his will to win, his wife, and his home.  His friend, Cal, takes his wife, his home, and the NASCAR spotlight. Ricky and his two sons head for Ricky's hometown, where he moves back in with his mother.  While living with his mom, Ricky learns that he needs to quit trying to impress others and do things for himself.  His useless father also drifts into town and teaches him how to be a real racer.  It all boils down to Talladega, where Ricky Bobby faces his old best friend and his new French foe.The story is just plain silly.  There's absolutely nothing wrong with that, but it all feels forced upon the viewer.  It's as if Ferrell is saying, ""It's me, Will Ferrell, laugh!""  I have nothing against Ferrell, but he just isn't funny in this flick.  It features ex-SNL buddies, David Koechner and  Molly Shannon.  Koechner never was funny on SNL in my opinion, and he does nothing to improve his status with me here.  Shannon has a minor role but makes the most of it and is one of the few bright spots in the film.  Gary Cole plays Ferrell's father and had he had better lines to work with, he would have done a better job.  John C. Reilly is good, but he is so much better in other films.  Sasha Baron Cohen is wasted here.  He's much funnier than this flick would imply.Overall, if you enjoyed Ferrell in ""Anchorman,"" you'll probably find this film to be hilarious.  I personally just don't care for it.  If you're a NASCAR fan, I'm sure you can enjoy the ribbings poked at you and your sport, but there must be something better out there.Mildly recommended to comedy fans.",3,Middle Of The Pack,1169510400,"01 23, 2007",2007,2728,"['Talladega', 'Nights', ""n't"", 'worst', 'film', 'there', ""n't"", 'funniest', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'can', 'execute', 'very', 'funny', 'moments', 'films', 'especially', 'Elf', 'However', 'when', 'given', 'free', 'reign', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'Anchorman', 'Ferrell', 'skip', 'part', 'trying', 'be', 'funny', 'attempts', 'be', 'silly', 'viewer', 'wondering', 'why', 'much', 'dialogue', 'character', 'rest', 'film', 'often', 'sense', 'Talladega', 'Nights', 'Ferrell', 'Ricky', 'Bobby', 'idiot', 'who', 'go', 'fast', 'lives', 'code', 'deadbeat', 'father', 'gave', 'career', 'day', 'school', ""'re"", 'not', 'first', ""'re"", 'last', 'standard', 'tow', 'Ricky', 'top', 'racer', 'NASCAR', 'thanks', 'help', 'best', 'friend', 'Cal', 'Naughton', 'Jr.', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'wings', 'however', 'one', 'Jean', 'Girard', 'Sasha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'Formula', 'One', 'racer', 'who', 'determined', 'take', 'over', 'NASCAR', 'eliminate', 'Ricky', 'Bobby', 'Well', 'what', 'be', 'Girard', 'motive', 'reason', 'NASCAR', 'revealed', 'later', 'film', 'terrible', 'accident', 'Ricky', 'Bobby', 'will', 'win', 'wife', 'home', 'friend', 'Cal', 'wife', 'home', 'NASCAR', 'spotlight', 'Ricky', 'two', 'sons', 'head', 'Ricky', 'hometown', 'where', 'back', 'mother', 'living', 'mom', 'Ricky', 'quit', 'trying', 'impress', 'others', 'do', 'things', 'useless', 'father', 'also', 'town', 'how', 'be', 'real', 'racer', 'down', 'Talladega', 'where', 'Ricky', 'Bobby', 'old', 'best', 'friend', 'new', 'French', 'foe.The', 'story', 'just', 'plain', 'silly', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'feels', 'forced', 'viewer', 'Ferrell', 'saying', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'laugh', 'have', 'nothing', 'Ferrell', 'just', ""n't"", 'funny', 'flick', 'ex-SNL', 'buddies', 'David', 'Koechner', 'Molly', 'Shannon', 'Koechner', 'never', 'was', 'funny', 'SNL', 'opinion', 'nothing', 'improve', 'status', 'here', 'Shannon', 'minor', 'role', 'most', 'one', 'few', 'bright', 'spots', 'film', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'Ferrell', 'father', 'had', 'had', 'better', 'lines', 'work', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'good', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'other', 'films', 'Sasha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'wasted', 'here', 'much', 'funnier', 'flick', 'would', 'imply.Overall', 'enjoyed', 'Ferrell', 'Anchorman', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'find', 'film', 'be', 'hilarious', 'personally', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', ""'re"", 'NASCAR', 'fan', ""'m"", 'sure', 'can', 'enjoy', 'ribbings', 'poked', 'sport', 'must', 'be', 'something', 'better', 'out', 'there.Mildly', 'recommended', 'comedy', 'fans']",N/A

1024526,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000J3OTO6,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[0, 3]","Wow. I am sitting watching ""Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby"" and trying to decide if this is a movie made by people who like NASCAR or hate NASCAR. I can see evidence for both perspectives in this 2006 Will Ferrell comedy, but by the time we get to what I will describe as the non-handshake scene between Ferrell's Ricky Bobby and Sacha Baron Cohen's Jean Girard (I would have been worried about their futures by the former has ""Stranger Than Fiction"" and the later has ""Borat"" no-I-will-not-do-the-entire-title, so things are looking up for both). So seeing Dale Earnhardt Jr., Darrell Waltrip, and other drives in this movie was something of a surprise. I mean, this is a movie where the title character has to come back from a spectacular crash and where the big race in the finale has what I assume is one of the biggest car crashes in a big race finale of recent memory. Now, I know that car crashes are a part of racing and that people get killed doing them, but Dale Earnhardt Jr. being in a movie that has such fun with car crashes creeps me out a little bit. To be clear, I am not a NASCAR fan. I do not watch car races. But I have to wonder: If I think this film is rather insulting to NASCAR and its fans, then is it not reasonable to think that NASCAR fans would find it even more insulting? This movie made $148,213,377 at the U.S. box-office and there is no way of knowing but I wonder if most of that money can from NASCAR fans or non-NASCAR fans.My wife did not watch this movie, but she walked into the room while I was going through the special features and after watching 15 seconds she turned to me and said, ""NASCA endorsed this?"" To be clear, she was even more incredulous than I was. However, the special features make it clear that the approach with this movie was apparently not so much writing a script but letting the camera roll will characters tossed off lines. I assume they then went into the screen room and anything anybody actually laughed at they put into the movie (I liked the literary analysis by Walker and Texas Ranger of the Steinbeck story read to them by grandma, although I think Walker and Texas Ranger would be funnier names if the kids were twins). The story is that producers pitched this movie idea to the studios with the six words ""Will Ferrell as a NASCAR driver,"" which must be how they sold it to NASCAR as well because you would hate to think that they read this script and signed off on it. Then again I can see how they could have shown the script to NASCAR and then threaten to make it even worse if NASCAR did not go along with it.This is not to say that ""Talladega Nights"" is without redeeming social value. There is the important lesson that when your daddy blows into town and stops guzzling bear long enough to lay down a stupid law like ""You're either first or your last,"" you should not let that become your core belief let along your mantra. Of course the lesson would work a bit better if it came from somebody other than daddy in another one of his semi-sober moments, but there is an actual lesson in this movie and that must be acknowledged because it provides cover for some of the other nonsense. This is a movie that takes the stereotypes associated with this sport and the South and embraces them. I think it is making fun of them more so than celebrating them, but that is just my opinion and probably that was the whole point. I just cannot get over the fact that NASCAR signed off and let them do this at their racetracks. To reiterate my opening point: Wow.""Talladega Nights"" also raises some interesting theological points, and not just on Ricky Bobby's willingness to call on not only baby Jesus but the Jewish God and Allah when he is trying not to burn to death, which would be an implicit plea for universal oneness and religious tolerance. Ricky Bobby likes to pray to baby Jesus instead of the risen Lord that you would think would be the Jesus people should be praying too. Ricky Bobby's position is not all that extreme given what the types of Jesus that his best friend and sons like to pray to, so he ends up being the voice of moderation here (scary thought). We are all aware that Catholics have the opportunity to pray to different saints who are associated with particular occupations, vocations and situations, so the thought that there is a continuum of Jesuses that you could pray to is rather provocative. Please realize I am talking about something like Jesus at the Wedding in Canaan or Jesus cleansing the Temple in Jerusalem and not the ninja Jesus suggested in this movie. Okay, clearly I am plumbing for depths in shallow waters at this point, but I had all these brain cells I was not using while watching this film and this was actually what went through my mind.",3,I

Well, good, because that was my intention...makes this more fun to write...In my opinion, the sport of NASCAR was best summed up by comedian Jeff Dunham's puppet, Sweet Daddy D, who said the following:""Look, they're making a left turn.  Oh, they're making another left turn.  Oh, they're making another left turn.  I wonder what's gonna happen next.""This film was pitched to the studios with the single line ""Six words:  Will Ferrell  as a NASCAR driver.""  Personally, I don't think more needs to be said.  One can always rely on Mr. Ferrell's ability to come up with some crazy line and/or antic on the spot, so there's certainly never a dull moment when you watch Ricky Bobby.  Jane Lynch was also funny as his mother.  And having Amy Adams in the film is certainly always a bonus in my book...perhaps I could complain that she didn't get more screen time, but that's just me.  And Michael Clark Duncan proves that he has left this world way too soon with his role as Ricky Bobby's friend and the lead of his pit crew.  And finally, I've never been a real fan of Sacha Baron Cohen, but his performance as French gay Formula One racer Jean Girard showed us something too often overlooked in sports movies...the ability of opponents to be polite to one another outside of competition instead of letting their rivalry consume every bit of their lives.  Yes, Ricky wanted to beat Girard again, but the majority of this film revolved around him facing his fears and learning to race again, so one (like me) can say that the rivalry between these two men came second to that, making my previous point valid.  Finally, John C. Reilly, a man who can earn an Academy Award nomination and give a heart-filled performance in a film like this, serves as Ricky Bobby's best friend, even if that friendship is strained at times.  Leslie Bibb and Gary Cole round out this great cast as Ricky's gold-digging hot wife and Ricky's absent, alcoholic father.  And, to end this review, I will say that this movie scored points by not having the stereotypical ending of sports movies in which the underdog overcomes all odds to emerge as the champion.  Sure, Ricky Bobby comes out on top, but he gets a lot of better things than just a trophy or medal.",5,Movie With a Really Long Name,1378512000,"09 7, 2013",2013,2266,"['subject', 'line', 'throw', 'off', 'Well', 'good', 'was', 'intention', 'more', 'fun', 'write', 'opinion', 'sport', 'NASCAR', 'was', 'best', 'summed', 'up', 'comedian', 'Jeff', 'Dunham', 'puppet', 'Sweet', 'Daddy', 'D', 'who', 'said', 'following', 'Look', ""'re"", 'making', 'left', 'turn', 'Oh', ""'re"", 'making', 'left', 'turn', 'Oh', ""'re"", 'making', 'left', 'turn', 'wonder', 'what', 'gon', 'happen', 'next', 'film', 'was', 'pitched', 'studios', 'single', 'line', 'Six', 'words', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'NASCAR', 'driver', 'Personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'more', 'needs', 'be', 'said', 'One', 'can', 'always', 'rely', 'Mr.', 'Ferrell', 'ability', 'come', 'up', 'crazy', 'line', 'antic', 'spot', 'certainly', 'never', 'dull', 'moment', 'when', 'watch', 'Ricky', 'Bobby', 'Jane', 'Lynch', 'was', 'also', 'funny', 'mother', 'having', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'film', 'certainly', 'always', 'bonus', 'book', 'perhaps', 'could', 'complain', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'just', 'Michael', 'Clark', 'Duncan', 'left', 'world', 'way', 'too', 'soon', 'role', 'Ricky', 'Bobby', 'friend', 'lead', 'pit', 'crew', 'finally', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'real', 'fan', 'Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'performance', 'French', 'gay', 'Formula', 'One', 'racer', 'Jean', 'Girard', 'showed', 'something', 'too', 'often', 'overlooked', 'sports', 'movies', 'ability', 'opponents', 'be', 'polite', 'one', 'outside', 'competition', 'instead', 'letting', 'rivalry', 'consume', 'bit', 'lives', 'Yes', 'Ricky', 'wanted', 'beat', 'Girard', 'again', 'majority', 'film', 'revolved', 'facing', 'fears', 'learning', 'race', 'again', 'one', 'can', 'say', 'rivalry', 'two', 'men', 'came', 'second', 'making', 'previous', 'point', 'valid', 'Finally', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'earn', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'give', 'heart-filled', 'performance', 'film', 'Ricky', 'Bobby', 'best', 'friend', 'even', 'friendship', 'strained', 'times', 'Leslie', 'Bibb', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'round', 'out', 'great', 'cast', 'Ricky', 'gold-digging', 'hot', 'wife', 'Ricky', 'absent', 'alcoholic', 'father', 'end', 'review', 'will', 'say', 'movie', 'scored', 'points', 'not', 'having', 'stereotypical', 'ending', 'sports', 'movies', 'underdog', 'odds', 'emerge', 'champion', 'Sure', 'Ricky', 'Bobby', 'out', 'top', 'lot', 'better', 'things', 'just', 'trophy', 'medal']",N/A

Beyond Ferrell and Boren, there's a great deal of fun to be had from the likes of John C. Reilly, Michael Clark Duncan, Molly Shannon, Gary Cole, and Leslie Bibb, among others, all of whom slide into their roles with a minimum of fuss and a maximum of comic talent.

It works because the conflicts between the characters are rooted in a specific context. While we may be glad the sexism and societal prejudices of the 70's are gone, the movie also makes clear that nostalgia is not a reason to appreciate the past. It's okay to move on. But most of all, the movie is just plain funny.Then there was this movie. Maybe my expectations were high. Maybe I thought Will Ferrell, who is funny in almost anything, would make it tolerable. But, alas, I was disappointed.Where Anchorman looked on the 70's with a certain sweetness, understanding that how people act is largely dependent on the situations in which they live, Talladega Nights mocks a whole culture and people in a pretentious and typical Hollywood-elitist manner. In Anchorman, the film makers truly liked the characters, as in American Pie. Bumbling and sexist is funny in this context.

1024569,A6FIAB28IS79,B000J3OTO6,Samuel Chell,"[3, 10]","The only thing unfunny about Will Ferrell on SNL was the sophomoric, loud and repetitious cheerleader skit.  Unfortunately, that's the only thing he's been bringing with him to the big screen.  In terms of the art of film comedy this one takes us back to pre-Chaplin, pre-Buster Keaton days--all the way back to Mack Sennett, who showed up on the Keystone set everyday without a clue and a bunch of guys in cop uniforms.  From that point on, the ""writing"" consisted of improvised slapstick called ""riffing"" (start with a single idea, premise, situation and go from there). At least, they didn't have the arrogance to credit ""writers"" in the screen credits.There are just enough hip allusions and racing send-ups in the movie to allow a mainstream NASCAR audience to view the film and think of themselves as being tolerant (even having a sense of humor about themselves!).  But don't kid yourself.  This is as lowbrow as it gets, guaranteed to appeal to a broad redneck mentality that simply enjoys seeing itself magnified in any fashion on the screen--proves they must be pretty important, after all.  Sold American!If you had doubts, what are the chances of a sophisticated, cultured adult Frenchman reading Camus' ""The Stranger""?  (Even Dubya, we were told, read that book along with a couple of ""Shakespeares"" last summer!)  And guess what artists have a reputation for being gay.  Male ballet dancers?  Broadway actors?  Symphonic conductors?  Classical organists?  Not according to this film, which would have us believe that testosterone-driven jazz is the music with which to stereotype a gay Frenchman who obviously doesn't belong in the same bar as the film's dukes of Dixie.  So much for any pretenses at genuine satire, which depends on careful attention to details such as this.Then there's the physical stuff.  Guys kissing guys (isn't this getting a bit stale?), which comes off not as a countercultural slap at Southern homophobia but as a mockery of wimps like Robin Williams and Nathan Lane.  Or Farrell running around in his underwear in all his glorious mid-riff flab.  Problem is Chris Farley had more of it and used it more humorously if not gracefully.  Even the ending of the race is unclever, unimaginative, unmemorable and unfunny, given all of the visual possibilities with machines and humans racing one another to a finish line (I doubt the writers of this screenplay have ever seen a Chaplin or Keaton sequence employing the same device to always surprising, ingenious and creative effect).Just be thankful you didn't buy theater tickets for a family of four.  Even my son, who is a big racing and Ferrell fan, sat silent and stone-faced throughout.  With the exception of the rare ""Little Miss Sunshine,"" today's screen comedies are making even Jerry Lewis' movies look good (a jab at the French adulation of J.L. which it didn't even occur to the writers of this movie to use).",2,Get out the yellow flag.,1166918400,"12 24, 2006",2006,2908,"['only', 'thing', 'unfunny', 'about', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'SNL', 'was', 'sophomoric', 'loud', 'repetitious', 'cheerleader', 'skit', 'Unfortunately', 'only', 'thing', 'been', 'bringing', 'big', 'screen', 'terms', 'art', 'film', 'comedy', 'one', 'back', 'pre-Chaplin', 'pre-Buster', 'Keaton', 'days', 'way', 'back', 'Mack', 'Sennett', 'who', 'showed', 'up', 'Keystone', 'set', 'everyday', 'clue', 'bunch', 'guys', 'cop', 'uniforms', 'point', 'writing', 'consisted', 'improvised', 'slapstick', 'called', 'riffing', 'start', 'single', 'idea', 'premise', 'situation', 'go', 'there', 'least', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'arrogance', 'credit', 'writers', 'screen', 'are', 'just', 'enough', 'hip', 'allusions', 'racing', 'send-ups', 'movie', 'allow', 'mainstream', 'NASCAR', 'audience', 'view', 'film', 'think', 'being', 'tolerant', 'even', 'having', 'sense', 'humor', 'do', ""n't"", 'kid', 'as', 'lowbrow', 'guaranteed', 'appeal', 'broad', 'redneck', 'mentality', 'simply', 'seeing', 'magnified', 'fashion', 'screen', 'must', 'be', 'pretty', 'important', 'Sold', 'American', 'had', 'doubts', 'what', 'are', 'chances', 'sophisticated', 'cultured', 'adult', 'Frenchman', 'reading', 'Camus', 'Stranger', 'Even', 'Dubya', 'were', 'told', 'read', 'book', 'couple', 'Shakespeares', 'last', 'summer', 'guess', 'what', 'artists', 'have', 'reputation', 'being', 'gay', 'Male', 'ballet', 'dancers', 'Broadway', 'actors', 'Symphonic', 'conductors', 'Classical', 'organists', 'Not', 'according', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'testosterone-driven', 'jazz', 'music', 'stereotype', 'gay', 'Frenchman', 'who', 'obviously', ""n't"", 'belong', 'same', 'bar', 'film', 'dukes', 'Dixie', 'So', 'much', 'pretenses', 'genuine', 'satire', 'careful', 'attention', 'details', 'such', 'this.Then', 'physical', 'stuff', 'Guys', 'kissing', 'guys', ""n't"", 'getting', 'bit', 'stale', 'off', 'not', 'countercultural', 'slap', 'Southern', 'homophobia', 'mockery', 'wimps', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Nathan', 'Lane', 'Farrell', 'running', 'around', 'underwear', 'glorious', 'mid-riff', 'flab', 'Problem', 'Chris', 'Farley', 'had', 'more', 'used', 'more', 'humorously', 'not', 'gracefully', 'Even', 'ending', 'race', 'unclever', 'unimaginative', 'unmemorable', 'unfunny', 'given', 'visual', 'possibilities', 'machines', 'humans', 'racing', 'one', 'finish', 'line', 'doubt', 'writers', 'screenplay', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Chaplin', 'Keaton', 'sequence', 'employing', 'same', 'device', 'always', 'surprising', 'ingenious', 'creative', 'effect', '.Just', 'be', 'thankful', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'theater', 'tickets', 'family', 'four', 'Even', 'son', 'who', 'big', 'racing', 'Ferrell', 'fan', 'sat', 'silent', 'stone-faced', 'exception', 'rare', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'today', 'screen', 'comedies', 'are', 'making', 'even', 'Jerry', 'Lewis', 'movies', 'look', 'good', 'jab', 'French', 'adulation', 'J.L', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'occur', 'writers', 'movie', 'use']",N/A

1024572,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B000J3OTO6,Scott Schiefelbein,"[0, 3]","Will Ferrell's latest comedic effort, ""Talladega Nights:  The Ballad of Ricky Bobby"" calls to mind one of my favorite Mel Brooks quotes.  A person who had seen one of Mr. Brooks' early comedies accused him of making a ""vulgar"" film.  Mr. Brooks' response was something along the lines of, ""Madame, my film rises below vulgarity.""That kind of ridiculous-yet-sublime humor motivates the best of Will Ferrell's comic efforts, whether it be ""More cowbell!"" on Saturday Night Live or ""Stay sexy, San Diego,"" in ""Anchorman.""  There is plenty of ""stupid wit"" on exhibition in ""Talladega Nights,"" and it is executed nearly flawlessly.  This is an improvement over Ferrell's previous project with director Adam McKay, the occasionally-hilarious ""Anchorman.""The titular Ricky Bobby was born in an American muscle car going over 100 mph as dear old dad (Gary Cole) was having too good a time driving fast to bother to stop at the hospital.  Dad was the biggest formative influence on Ricky, showing up to Ricky's school stoned and saying, ""If you're not first, you're last.""  That becomes Ricky's guiding philosophy as he joins the NASCAR circuit, along with his friend Cal (John C. Reilly, in a performance that brings to mind Jeff Daniels' wonderful job in ""Dumb and Dumber"").  Together, they form ""Shake n Bake,"" where Cal always helps Ricky win and together they put product placements on everything in sight . . . including saying grace.That's all I'll do as far as recapping the plot, but it is a comic plot full of rich, intelligent-stupid humor.  To say that NASCAR is ripe for the comic picking is an understatement, and Ferrell's team nails it without ever getting condescending.  Sure, there are plenty of jokes poked at NASCAR fans, but it's the same kind of humor you find in ""My Name is Earl"" on TV - these guys may be losers, but they have a certain dignity to them.  And speaking of ""Earl,"" if you like Jaime Pressly in the role of Joy, you are going to love Leslie Bibb's performance as Carley Bobby, Ricky's NASCAR-flamboyant (and opportunistic) wife.Look for several laugh-out-loud moments in ""TN,"" but surprisingly little profanity and no nudity.  I'm reviewing the ""Unrated"" edition, and other than a couple of f-bombs that apparently weren't in the theatrical version, there is nothing here that obviously warrants a ""Do Not Let the Kiddies See This Version"" alert.  Also, sit through the out-takes over the closing credits for some hilarious moments involving Ferrell, Reilly, Michael Clarke Duncan, and others riffing unsuccessfully during various scenes.Here's to you, Ricky Bobby - you're surely #1 on the NASCAR charts.",4,A movie that rises below stupidity - hilarious!,1168819200,"01 15, 2007",2007,2635,"['Will', 'Ferrell', 'latest', 'comedic', 'effort', 'Talladega', 'Nights', 'Ballad', 'Ricky', 'Bobby', 'mind', 'one', 'favorite', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'quotes', 'A', 'person', 'who', 'had', 'seen', 'one', 'Mr.', 'Brooks', 'early', 'comedies', 'accused', 'making', 'vulgar', 'film', 'Mr.', 'Brooks', 'response', 'was', 'something', 'lines', 'Madame', 'film', 'vulgarity', 'kind', 'ridiculous-yet-sublime', 'humor', 'best', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'comic', 'efforts', 'be', 'More', 'cowbell', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'Stay', 'sexy', 'San', 'Diego', 'Anchorman', 'plenty', 'stupid', 'wit', 'exhibition', 'Talladega', 'Nights', 'executed', 'nearly', 'flawlessly', 'improvement', 'Ferrell', 'previous', 'project', 'director', 'Adam', 'McKay', 'occasionally-hilarious', 'Anchorman', 'titular', 'Ricky', 'Bobby', 'was', 'born', 'American', 'muscle', 'car', 'going', '100', 'mph', 'dear', 'old', 'dad', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'was', 'having', 'too', 'good', 'time', 'driving', 'fast', 'bother', 'stop', 'hospital', 'Dad', 'was', 'biggest', 'formative', 'influence', 'Ricky', 'showing', 'up', 'Ricky', 'school', 'stoned', 'saying', ""'re"", 'not', 'first', ""'re"", 'last', 'Ricky', 'guiding', 'philosophy', 'NASCAR', 'circuit', 'friend', 'Cal', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'performance', 'mind', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'wonderful', 'job', 'Dumb', 'Dumber', 'Together', 'form', 'Shake', 'n', 'Bake', 'where', 'Cal', 'always', 'Ricky', 'win', 'together', 'put', 'product', 'placements', 'everything', 'sight', 'including', 'saying', 'grace.That', ""'ll"", 'do', 'as', 'far', 'recapping', 'plot', 'comic', 'plot', 'full', 'rich', 'intelligent-stupid', 'humor', 'say', 'NASCAR', 'ripe', 'comic', 'picking', 'understatement', 'Ferrell', 'team', 'ever', 'getting', 'condescending', 'Sure', 'are', 'plenty', 'jokes', 'poked', 'NASCAR', 'fans', 'same', 'kind', 'humor', 'find', 'Name', 'Earl', 'TV', 'guys', 'may', 'be', 'losers', 'have', 'certain', 'dignity', 'speaking', 'Earl', 'like', 'Jaime', 'Pressly', 'role', 'Joy', 'are', 'going', 'love', 'Leslie', 'Bibb', 'performance', 'Carley', 'Bobby', 'Ricky', 'NASCAR-flamboyant', 'opportunistic', 'wife.Look', 'several', 'laugh-out-loud', 'moments', 'TN', 'surprisingly', 'little', 'profanity', 'nudity', ""'m"", 'reviewing', 'Unrated', 'edition', 'other', 'couple', 'f-bombs', 'apparently', 'were', ""n't"", 'theatrical', 'version', 'nothing', 'here', 'obviously', 'warrants', 'Do', 'Not', 'Let', 'Kiddies', 'See', 'Version', 'alert', 'Also', 'sit', 'out-takes', 'closing', 'credits', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'involving', 'Ferrell', 'Reilly', 'Michael', 'Clarke', 'Duncan', 'others', 'riffing', 'unsuccessfully', 'various', 'Ricky', 'Bobby', ""'re"", 'surely', '1', 'NASCAR', 'charts']",N/A
1024573,AJJ11F5MHN8K9,B000J3OTO6,"sfarmer76 ""sfarmer76""","[1, 4]","Talladega Nights recently roared to the top of the summer box office, and the success of this comedy -- featuring former SNL star Will Ferrell -- is really no great surprise to me. I went to a matinee viewing on a sweltering Friday afternoon in August, and more than one hundred fifty people had the same idea that day. Thank goodness the air conditioning was working!Adam McKay directed this somewhat lengthy movie from a script he co-wrote with Ferrell. For the most part their jointly-penned screenplay seems to work, but there are a few dead spots in the proceedings and on occasion you'll forget you're watching a broad satirical comedy. But for every gag that fails there are two or three jokes looking for a slot to squeeze through, in this slightly uneven crowd-pleaser.Looking at Ferrell's previous box office record, you've got to be impressed that TN:TBORB scored $47 million in its debut. Maybe the movie's tagline -- ""the story of a man that could only count to No. 1"" -- is responsible for that? This live-action comedy fronted 3,800 screens, grabbing the #1 weekend position, and it easily earned Ferrell more money than Elf ($31 million) ever did.Luckily, Ferrell doesn't mind going toe to toe with other talented actors. Half the fun in Talladega Nights occurs when Ferrell faces off with Gary Cole (who plays the role of his transient father Reese), John C. Reilly (who plays the role of best friend and racing partner Cal Naughton Jr.), or Sacha Baron Cohen (who plays the role of the evil French driver, Jean Girard).Although the men hog most of the hysterical Talladega Nights scenes, there are a few great women that shine in the smaller parts. Jane Lynch (who plays the role of Ricky's tough as nails mother), Leslie Bibb (who plays the role of Ricky's trophy wife), and Amy Adams (who plays the role of Ricky's mousy assistant) all acquit themselves quite nicely in their sparsely allotted moments.Dozens of scenes stand out, but I'd have to say my all-time favorite segment would be the scene where Ricky Bobby sits down with his rowdy extended family (best friend Cal, father-in-law Chip, wife Carley, two potty-mouthed sons) to say the most hilarious grace that I've ever heard uttered on film. While some of the southern humor employed here is crude, it rings true to life.Even though Cohen Cohen plays a stereotypical bad guy, he really squeezes some mileage out of what could have been a rather distasteful role. Sacha stars as Jean Girard, a gay French Formula 1 driver -- whom amusingly drives the citrus green Perrier racecar -- who's going to knock Ricky Bobby out of the Talladega 500 and humiliate him in front of his family, friends, and NASCAR fan base.Gladly, the script lets Cohen rise above a caricature with an accent. In one of the funnier scenes Jean Girard confronts Ricky Bobby in a bar after Girard starts playing jazz on the jukebox, and Girard then threatens to break Ricky's arm, reminding him that the French created ""democracy, existentialism, and crepes,"" which everybody agrees are good things. Girard then departs after throwing down the obligatory challenge.And Ferrell is funny in many sequences, including one where Girard wrecks his car causing Ricky to go psychosomatic -- he thinks he's on fire, strips out of his racing suit -- and start prancing around the racetrack in his underwear, screaming ""Help me Jesus! Help me Oprah! Help me Tom Cruise!"" Cal eventually corners Ricky, dousing the imaginary fire, and then Ricky Bobby is carted away.Now, psychosomatic people aren't always funny. That's unless they're being dumped by their sponsors and wives, and end up delivering pizzas on a bicycle. That's unless their redneck father plants cocaine on their car and sets police on their tale, unless they try driving while blindfolded, drive with a wild cougar for a passenger, or stab their own leg when they're told specifically not to. That's funny!If you wonder how Ricky Bobby ended up being this speed loving, ""big hairy American winning machine,"" well look no further than his hard drinking daddy Reese Bobby, who once had the audacity to show up at Career Day when Ricky was 10 years old, only to insult the teacher and be thrown out of the elementary school when he exhorts ""If you ain't first, you're last!""Goofy though it may be Talladega Nights has both a heart and a message -- NASCAR wouldn't have allowed Ferrell to lampoon them otherwise. Seems the executives down in Florida rolled the proverbial dice, knowing they could attract a wider audience if the film scored well for SONY. The racing and the wrecks in the movie looked authentic because NASCAR knew that would be essential to fans.Having belabored the finer points of the film, I've got an argument. Since this film's second tagline is, ""the ballad of Ricky Bobby,"" I've got to wonder, where's the ballad? I expected a great song at the end of the closing credits, not a blooper reel -- even though the bloopers were funny. Especially Michael Clarke Duncan's rendition of that WHAM song.Talladega Nights missed taking chances with really appropriate cameos too! How on earth could they make a movie poking fun at rednecks and not offer national treasure Jeff Foxworthy a role? Sure Dale Earnhardt Jr. made an appearance, but he was only on screen a few seconds. Based on the very strong $47 million first weekend gross, I'd say Daytona Nights would make for a probable sequel.Some humor in TN: TBORB backfires, but overall it's virtually impossible to dislike the movie given the performances of Cohen, Cole, Lynch, and Reilly. You don't have to be a NASCAR fan to enjoy this flick, so why hesitate? Try something new. Take your mind off the ridiculous $3 a gallon gas at BP. Go buy a ticket! Scarf down some popcorn! Put your feet up! Enjoy!",5,Dumb Guys Win Big...,1155513600,"08 14, 2006",2006,5776,"['Talladega', 'Nights', 'recently', 'roared', 'top', 'summer', 'box', 'office', 'success', 'comedy', 'featuring', 'former', 'SNL',

1024578,A38VQ2TIPPBKNN,B000J3OTO6,"Sir Charles Panther ""Life is hard.  It's hard...","[28, 37]","I can see why this film did not do particularly well in America's megaplexes.  While it's no ""Team America: World Police"" in its slams on America's society and sense of itself (or the profanity), there's more than enough pointed observation and mockery of our American lives in here to turn off all the American moviegoers who loved ""Anchorman"" so much.  Me, I thought it was hilarious.What better guy to be a racing bad guy than a Frenchman?  These days the French are almost a default enemy, a generic sort of oppositional bad guy, not nearly as bad as, you know, The Terrorists, but still someone Fox News and Rush and O'Reilly and all of us can easily get behind and hate together, as Americans.  Yeah, in their first meeting and his very first scene Sacha Baron Cohen's brilliant Jean Gerard breaks Ricky's arm, but it comes down to a matter of manly pride and promise, and not out of malice; and Ricky started the fight (America, get it?).  Gerard comes off as fey and ridiculous (Cohen is so damn good), but he's also portrayed as worldly, sophisticated, learned, introspective, even noble.  His ultimate secret is that he's been looking for a champion for years, for someone to beat him so he can be free of racing and move on to his true life's pursuits.  Does anyone else see the legendary Lancelot in this portrayal?  Hell, we've even got one of the film's characters talking of King Arthur and his betrayal by Guinevere, right around the time of Ricky's fall.And those wonderfully funny shots at Middle America, right from the start.  I mean, the wonderful Bobby family mealtime is Domino's, KFC and Taco Bell and 2-liter bottles of Coke on the table.  And that's what they eat every night, with a ridiculous grace involving alternate visual incarnations of Jesus and thanks for the wife's wonderful hoo-hahs, and culminates with a nice family fight.  And the two boys are foul-mouthed, attitude-barking little hellions who need a slap in the face (thankfully they get it, but they're still mighty funny).  The big family celebrations take place at Applebee's.  Ricky and Cal bond over the phone watching inane cable television.  Yeah, that's America today, buddy.  it's all over this film.The product placement, of course, is mind-blowing, absolutely numbing.  But what do you expect, given the subject?Loved Andy Richter as Gerard's husband, Gregory.  He should've had more screen time, but I can see where the homosexual marriage bit didn't test too well for Amercian release.  Also loved the cameos of Elvis Costello and Mos Def, really very strange and funny.This ""unrated"" edition doesn't really give you that much extra.  There is only one instance of R-rated language in the entire film, and there's no nudity.  The only violence is Gerard's breaking of Bobby's arm, which could be considered to be relatively graphic, but at the same time it's pretty hokey.  Even the special features and extras don't deliver on what most will want out of ""unrated"" content--it's all PG-13 clean.The special features aren't really that great.  As in the greatest of Southern-fried Burt Reynolds car films, the end titles roll over some pretty good gags.  But, hey, there's a gag reel, too, but it's over in about six minutes, pitifully short given the huge amount of improvisation that obviously went into a number of scenes.  The extended and deleted scenes were plentiful enough, and I could see why they were deleted; most of them weren't that funny.Bottom line: This film is the simple, trite tale of the rapid rise and rapid fall, with the expected redemption and happily ever after resolution, set in Modern NASCAR.  There's plenty comedy to keep most folks laughin'. This film is no indictment of NASCAR; if anything, it's an extended commercial. But if you're smarter than the average bear and look beyond the mere slapstick, then you'll see some relatively well-developed satire about Our America, what makes us tick, how we think, and how we view The Other.",4,"Slapstick-Funny, and Some Wicked Satire, Too",1171152000,"02 11, 2007",2007,3972,"['can', 'see', 'why', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'particularly', 'well', 'America', 'megaplexes', 'Team', 'America', 'World', 'Police', 'slams', 'America', 'society', 'sense', 'profanity', 'more', 'enough', 'pointed', 'observation', 'mockery', 'American', 'lives', 'here', 'turn', 'off', 'American', 'moviegoers', 'who', 'loved', 'Anchorman', 'so', 'much', 'Me', 'thought', 'was', 'hilarious.What', 'better', 'guy', 'be', 'racing', 'bad', 'guy', 'Frenchman', 'days', 'French', 'are', 'almost', 'default', 'enemy', 'generic', 'sort', 'oppositional', 'bad', 'guy', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'bad', 'know', 'Terrorists', 'still', 'someone', 'Fox', 'News', 'Rush', ""O'Reilly"", 'can', 'easily', 'get', 'hate', 'together', 'Americans', 'Yeah', 'first', 'meeting', 'very', 'first', 'scene', 'Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'brilliant', 'Jean', 'Gerard', 'Ricky', 'arm', 'down', 'matter', 'manly', 'pride', 'promise', 'not', 'malice', 'Ricky', 'started', 'fight', 'America', 'get', 'Gerard', 'off', 'fey', 'ridiculous', 'Cohen', 'so', 'damn', 'good', 'also', 'portrayed', 'worldly', 'sophisticated', 'learned', 'introspective', 'even', 'noble', 'ultimate', 'secret', 'been', 'looking', 'champion', 'years', 'someone', 'beat', 'so', 'can', 'be', 'free', 'racing', 'move', 'true', 'life', 'pursuits', 'Does', 'anyone', 'else', 'see', 'legendary', 'Lancelot', 'portrayal', 'Hell', ""'ve"", 'even', 'got', 'one', 'film', 'characters', 'talking', 'King', 'Arthur', 'betrayal', 'Guinevere', 'right', 'time', 'Ricky', 'fall.And', 'wonderfully', 'funny', 'shots', 'Middle', 'America', 'right', 'start', 'mean', 'wonderful', 'Bobby', 'family', 'mealtime', 'Domino', 'KFC', 'Taco', 'Bell', '2-liter', 'bottles', 'Coke', 'table', 'what', 'eat', 'night', 'ridiculous', 'grace', 'involving', 'alternate', 'visual', 'incarnations', 'Jesus', 'thanks', 'wife', 'wonderful', 'hoo-hahs', 'nice', 'family', 'fight', 'two', 'boys', 'are', 'foul-mouthed', 'attitude-barking', 'little', 'hellions', 'who', 'need', 'slap', 'face', 'thankfully', 'get', ""'re"", 'still', 'mighty', 'funny', 'big', 'family', 'celebrations', 'take', 'place', 'Applebee', 'Ricky', 'Cal', 'bond', 'phone', 'watching', 'inane', 'cable', 'television', 'Yeah', 'America', 'today', 'buddy', 'film.The', 'product', 'placement', 'course', 'mind-blowing', 'absolutely', 'numbing', 'what', 'do', 'expect', 'given', 'subject', 'Loved', 'Andy', 'Richter', 'Gerard', 'husband', 'Gregory', 'should', ""'ve"", 'had', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'homosexual', 'marriage', 'bit', 'did', ""n't"", 'test', 'too', 'well', 'Amercian', 'release', 'Also', 'loved', 'cameos', 'Elvis', 'Costello', 'Mos', 'Def', 'really', 'very', 'strange', 'funny.This', 'unrated', 'edition', ""n't"", 'really', 'give', 'much', 'extra', 'only', 'one', 'instance', 'R-rated', 'language', 'entire', 'film', 'nudity', 'only', 'violence', 'Gerard', 'breaking', 'Bobby', 'arm', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'be', 'relatively', 'graphic', 'same', 'time', 'pretty', 'hokey', 'Even', 'special', 'features', 'extras', 'do', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'what', 'most', 'will', 'want', 'unrated', 'content', 'PG-13', 'clean.The', 'special', 'features', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'great', 'greatest', 'Southern-fried', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'car', 'films', 'end', 'roll', 'pretty', 'good', 'gags', 'hey', 'gag', 'reel', 'too', 'over', 'about', 'six', 'minutes', 'pitifully', 'short', 'given', 'huge', 'amount', 'improvisation', 'obviously', 'went', 'number', 'scenes', 'extended', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'were', 'plentiful', 'enough', 'could', 'see', 'why', 'were', 'deleted', 'most', 'were', ""n't"", 'funny.Bottom', 'line', 'film', 'simple', 'trite', 'tale', 'rapid', 'rise', 'rapid', 'fall', 'expected', 'redemption', 'happily', 'ever', 'resolution', 'set', 'Modern', 'NASCAR', 'plenty', 'comedy', 'keep', 'most', 'folks', 'laughin', 'film', 'indictment', 'NASCAR', 'anything', 'extended', 'commercial', ""'re"", 'smarter', 'average', 'bear', 'look', 'mere', 'slapstick', 'then', ""'ll"", 'see', 'relatively', 'well-developed', 'satire', 'America', 'what', 'tick', 'how', 'think', 'how', 'view', 'Other']",N/A

This has his same wacky sense of humour and hilarious delivery. This follows Rocky Bobby, who is a Nascar driver as he strives to drive faster and win races, gets challenged by an effeminate European driving sensation and loses everything and then finds what means most to him in his life. This has so many funny catchphrases in it that you can't help but laugh when they are repeated throughout the film (shake and bake) and Ferrell's delivery is what really makes this film. For example when he is driving with a Cougar in his car (!), it is so funny to watch him talk to it and roar back. His funny asides and commentary as things happen (like when he tells people to look away when he starts kissing a girl as `there's gonna be animal noises`) reminded me of Anchorman and raised just as many laughs. His two redneck, opinionated kids are hilarious as well and come out with some great lines.

This one was well-received, so I thought I'd check it out, especially since it has Sasha Baron Cohen in it, as well as John C Reilly, an actor I like very much. I'd say that of the three, John C Reilly is the funniest, with his good ole boy routine and his optimism that he can steal his best friend's hot wife and still remain buddies. Ha ha ha... Still, there are some good lines in the film like ""[The French} invented democracy, existentialism and the beejay."" Cohen, while not particularly funny here, does an interesting job portraying a ""happy"" Nascar driver. The gawks on commentators' faces when he introduces his husband are priceless. Sponsor's wife is lovin' the wall vibrations, that's pretty funny. Kenny Rogers scene is kind of funny. Nice use of a Monster Magnet song, ""Space Lord"", as well as AC/DC's ""TNT"", and Pat Benatar's ""We Belong"". Biggest car wreck ever. There's also a sort-of-funny ""I want to picture Jesus as a..."" running gag as well.The gag reel shows a great collection of Ricky and Cal's public service messages: kids on leashes, plastic - the silent killer, cardboard is edible, children reading too early, shopping cart safety, fare safety (kids wrapped in newspaper, sleep in a hammock, don't drink gasoline), shoplifting's fun, don't steal fireworks, packs of stray dogs that control most of the major cities of North America. Interviews with the actors in character are cute and sorta funny. The trailer shows scenes that are not in the actual movie (Ricky as a 10-year-old, for example).There's also a great French version of ""Paint It Black"" played in the film.

If you are a fan of NASCAR at all, and/or if your neck might be a shade of red, you'll get this movie and be laughing throughout.A dinner blessing/prayer that includes thanking the various sponsors, and a windshield laden with a sponsor message show the extents to which Ricky Bobby will go to get a buck from a sponsor.  None of which is far from the truth of the current state of NASCAR.Will Ferrell plays the son of race car driver Reese Bobby.  The elder Bobby abandon his son and his mother years before, basically leaving his son with but a memory of his father mumbling something along the lines of ""if you ain't first, you're last.""  Words that young Ricky remembered forever.Talladega Nights skewers NASCAR, NASCAR drivers, the partnerships that the driving teams make, and everything surrounding NASCAR, and does a great job at all of the above.  It's funny from start to finish, without being too crude along the way.Now, on the quality of the high-def on the Blu-ray version of this movie: shame, shame, shame on Sony for such a disappointing outcome with this disc.  Blu-ray is better than this.  Far better than this.  The original movie (on theatre screens) was better than this.  The video quality here -- where it should have been immediately impressive -- just isn't.  It's not horrible, but just doesn't seem like it's high def.  Instead it seems like someone forgot to remove or apply the correct filters.  Perhaps they were laughing too hard at the movie and forgot to hit the right switch while it was being manufactured, but it is not up to the standards one should expect of the Blu-ray format.Worse yet is that in the extras on the disc the video quality is often times better (far better) than that of the movie.  That is something that one would never expect of a high-def disc.3 stars (at best) for the video quality here.  Actually that's probably being generous.Hopefully Sony will make another attempt at getting the video of this movie right and perhaps release a special edition version, or deluxe version in the future.

1024594,A2VOSR1A3MLFKM,B000J3OTO6,"The Captain ""Bounty628""","[0, 7]","Something about Nascar just does not do it for me. Sitting for hours watching guys drive cars around in circles for hours upon end just does not really tickle my fancy. I see enough idiots driving on the highways on my way to work, therefore, I don't really need to see more idiots driving around in circles on the weekend.So I am not quite sure why then I might have had somewhat of high expectations for the movie Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby . Perhaps I was blinded by some decent Will Ferrell movies of the recent past and thought that perhaps even Ferrell himself might have been able to shine his comedic genius upon something that simply seems more banal and boring than humorous. But I was wrong.Will Ferrell plays the part of Ricky Bobby, a quirky and rather unintelligent man who always hoped to be a race car driver just like his deadbeat daddy before him. When fate should have its way Ricky becomes not just any Nascar driver but the lead point winner in the entire Nascar circuit. Ricky goes from being just another driver to basically the figurehead of Nascar racing.Ricky's childhood friend who almost has a man-crush on his best buddy is Cal Naughton, Jr. (John C. Reilly) Cal is, if you can believe it, perhaps a bit more dopey than Ricky Bobby and in fact sort of hopes to live up to what Ricky Bobby hopes for. Talk about aiming high! Cal for years has basically played second fiddle to Ricky Bobby and even on the race track often yields a victory to ensure Ricky Bobby comes in first.But when a ""serious"" injury nearly ruins Ricky Bobby's life, things take a turn for the worse. Speculation runs rampant that Ricky Bobby might not ever be able to race again and even his wife Carley (Leslie Bibb) begins to find herself not in love with the champion that she once had.Ricky Bobby's fall from the stardom opens the door for a driver that does not necessarily fit the whole redneck stereotype associated with race car driving. Rather, from France comes an F-1 standout now looking to become the Nascar champion, as well. Jean Girard (Sacha Baron Cohen) certainly is going to be a very different sort of individual now entering the world of Nascar and needless to say he and Ricky Bobby might come pretty close not just in their racing, but perhaps in other ways, as well.Directed Adam McKay, it seems as though Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby was set out to perhaps poke a little bit of fun at race car driving and the entire fascination behind Nascar. However, the humor in the movie is in actuality quite flat and unimaginative. There really are few scenes in the film that are drop dead funny and the overall feel that you get from the movie is more of a desire for it to be over rather than yearning for more.Though it did win an ESPY Award for Best Sports Movie, there were certainly no major awards bestowed upon it. One certainly should take issue with the ESPY Award, as well, since certainly there is little athletic ability in being able to drive a car around a track. That aside, there is a reason why Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby did not win any significant awards: it just isn't that good.For a Will Ferrell film, this movie falls well short of expectations and should be avoided at all costs. Just like sometimes the best part of a Nascar race is watching a car crash into the wall and ending its run in the race, the best part of this film was when it too had ended.",1,Talladega Nights Crashes and Burns,1215388800,"07 7, 2008",2008,3443,"['Something', 'Nascar', 'just', 'not', 'do', 'Sitting', 'hours', 'watching', 'guys', 'drive', 'cars', 'circles', 'hours', 'upon', 'end', 'just', 'not', 'really', 'tickle', 'fancy', 'see', 'enough', 'idiots', 'driving', 'highways', 'way', 'work', 'therefore', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'need', 'see', 'more', 'idiots', 'driving', 'around', 'circles', 'weekend.So', 'am', 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'why', 'then', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'somewhat', 'high', 'expectations', 'movie', 'Talladega', 'Nights', 'Ballad', 'Ricky', 'Bobby', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'blinded', 'decent', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'movies', 'recent', 'past', 'thought', 'perhaps', 'even', 'Ferrell', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'shine', 'comedic', 'genius', 'something', 'simply', 'more', 'banal', 'boring', 'humorous', 'was', 'wrong.Will', 'Ferrell', 'part', 'Ricky', 'Bobby', 'quirky', 'rather', 'unintelligent', 'man', 'who', 'always', 'hoped', 'be', 'race', 'car', 'driver', 'just', 'deadbeat', 'daddy', 'When', 'fate', 'should', 'have', 'way', 'Ricky', 'not', 'just', 'Nascar', 'driver', 'lead', 'point', 'winner', 'entire', 'Nascar', 'circuit', 'Ricky', 'being', 'just', 'driver', 'basically', 'figurehead', 'Nascar', 'racing.Ricky', 'childhood', 'friend', 'who', 'almost', 'man-crush', 'best', 'buddy', 'Cal', 'Naughton', 'Jr.', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'Cal', 'can', 'believe', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'more', 'dopey', 'Ricky', 'Bobby', 'fact', 'sort', 'hopes', 'live', 'up', 'what', 'Ricky', 'Bobby', 'Talk', 'aiming', 'high', 'Cal', 'years', 'basically', 'played', 'second', 'fiddle', 'Ricky', 'Bobby', 'even', 'race', 'track', 'often', 'victory', 'ensure', 'Ricky', 'Bobby', 'first.But', 'when', 'serious', 'injury', 'nearly', 'Ricky', 'Bobby', 'life', 'things', 'take', 'turn', 'worse', 'Speculation', 'rampant', 'Ricky', 'Bobby', 'might', 'not', 'ever', 'be', 'able', 'race', 'again', 'even', 'wife', 'Carley', 'Leslie', 'Bibb', 'find', 'not', 'love', 'champion', 'once', 'had.Ricky', 'Bobby', 'fall', 'stardom', 'door', 'driver', 'not', 'necessarily', 'fit', 'whole', 'redneck', 'stereotype', 'associated', 'race', 'car', 'driving', 'France', 'F-1', 'standout', 'now', 'looking', 'become', 'Nascar', 'champion', 'as', 'well', 'Jean', 'Girard', 'Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'certainly', 'going', 'be', 'very', 'different', 'sort', 'individual', 'now', 'entering', 'world', 'Nascar', 'needless', 'say', 'Ricky', 'Bobby', 'might', 'come', 'pretty', 'close', 'not', 'just', 'racing', 'perhaps', 'other', 'ways', 'well.Directed', 'Adam', 'McKay', 'Talladega', 'Nights', 'Ballad', 'Ricky', 'Bobby', 'was', 'set', 'out', 'perhaps', 'poke', 'little', 'bit', 'fun', 'race', 'car', 'driving', 'entire', 'fascination', 'Nascar', 'However', 'humor', 'movie', 'actuality', 'quite', 'flat', 'unimaginative', 'really', 'are', 'few', 'scenes', 'film', 'are', 'drop', 'dead', 'funny', 'overall', 'feel', 'get', 'movie', 'more', 'desire', 'be', 'rather', 'yearning', 'did', 'win', 'ESPY', 'Award', 'Best', 'Sports', 'Movie', 'were', 'certainly', 'no', 'major', 'awards', 'bestowed', 'One', 'certainly', 'should', 'take', 'issue', 'ESPY', 'Award', 'as', 'well', 'certainly', 'little', 'athletic', 'ability', 'being', 'able', 'drive', 'car', 'track', 'aside', 'reason', 'why', 'Talladega', 'Nights', 'Ballad', 'Ricky', 'Bobby', 'did', 'not', 'win', 'significant', 'awards', 'just', ""n't"", 'good.For', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'film', 'movie', 'well', 'short', 'expectations', 'should', 'be', 'avoided', 'costs', 'Just', 'sometimes', 'best', 'part', 'Nascar', 'race', 'watching', 'car', 'crash', 'wall', 'ending', 'run', 'race', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'was', 'when', 'too', 'had', 'ended']",N/A

Both films tell the story of a larger than life personality surrounded by a cast of eccentrics who live out a strange existence.Will Ferrell is a funny guy and in ""Talladega"" he returns to form. ""Talledega"" isn't a great film, far from it, but it shows off the comedic talents of the star far better than his previous few efforts, the disastrous ""Bewitched"" and ""Melinda and Melinda"". Ferrell is almost brilliant, in a way; he always comes so close to making us believe he is actually the character he is portraying. As Ricky Bobby, the North Carolina native who becomes a NASCAR champion, he brings earnestness to the role, making us feel for his character and believe he is the uneducated redneck he portrays. When he checks to make sure two tickets have been left at will call for his dad, a ticket vendor explains to his coworker Ricky Bobby always does this and his dad has yet to claim them. There are a couple of these low key, believable moments throughout which help to make his persona all the more real. At the same time, these moments provide a nice counterpoint to Ricky Bobby's outrageous behavior, making many moments funnier than they have a right to be.A lot of Ferrell's films seem to be improvised and ""Talladega"" follows this formula, adding to the charm of the film. This practice makes the characters seem more interesting because they speak in a more realistic way. Their conversations are filled with pauses, missteps, etc., much like a normal conversation.But ""Talladega"" also shares a similar problem with ""Anchorman""; the humor is very hit and miss. Part of this is attributed to the improvised nature of the dialogue; the characters often revisit topics and themes they apparently feel are hilarious but only elicit a chuckle or two. A prime example is Ricky Bobby's mealtime prayers to the ""Baby Jesus"". The first time Ferrell does this rift, it is funny and elicits laughter, partially because of the strangeness, but I get the feeling the filmmakers were overcome with hilarity because he does a similar rift at least one more time later in the film.John C. Reilly plays Cal, Ricky Bobby's lifelong friend and sidekick. He has a few funny moments playing a dumb, uneducated hick, but he is ultimately the straight man in the film.Michael Clarke Duncan, Greg Germann, Pat Hingle and others pop up in supporting roles. Molly Shannon has a short, but memorable bit as Germann's boozing wife. But none of these characters is given the opportunity to make an impact. The story is about Ricky Bobby, so only those who are closest to this character receive any significant screen time.Gary Cole has some amusing bits as Ricky Bobby's deadbeat dad who shows up a couple of times in his life. On one occasion, he shows up at Ricky Bobby's elementary school, just in time for career day, surprising his son. Following the Waffle House manager, Mr. Bobby explains what his life is like and that the class shouldn't listen to the teacher. He becomes a hero to Ricky's classmates and then quickly leaves his son's life again. Later, he returns when Ricky Bobby is having a hard time and tries to help his son get back on track by helping him train. This is a funny sequence involving driving while blindfolded and staring down a cougar in the car.Sacha Baron Cohen proves to be Ferrell's equal as Jean Girard, the French Formula One racer who comes to America for the opportunity to compete against Ricky Bobby. From the moment he arrives, speaking in an exaggerated accent, his mouth slowly forming the words in English, his performance is weird, interesting and slightly disarming. It takes a moment to get used to him.  realization struck. Many foreign actors use the same technique when they appear in their first American film, Gong Li in ""Miami Vice"" for example. If Cohen is making a comment on this, it is a brilliant idea. Basically, I think he is playing a French actor playing a French character in his first American film. It works. Very well. Then, when he shows up with Gregory (Andy Richter) and announces Richter is his husband, the role just becomes more weird, unusual and interesting. Unfortunately, most of this is probably lost on a significant portion of the audience.There were a lot of guys at the screening I attended, with their buddies, sitting with a seat between them, painting a perfect portrait of the intended audience for this film. Guys, NASCAR fans, the like. Yet, the film goes to great lengths to make fun of these same people. Many of these jokes are funny, but they are not as funny as the filmmakers think and they lose some of their impact. We get the point that Ricky Bobby is uneducated, so when he runs down the track after an accident praying to Jesus, `that Jewish guy', Tom Cruise and Oprah Winfrey, its funny. But later, when the family thinks fine dining is eating out at Applebee's, the joke is wearing thin. When Ricky Bobby reveals the name of his two kids, Walker and Texas Ranger, we laugh, but an ongoing joke where they show nothing but disrespect to their grandfather just doesn't work. We get the point that Ricky Bobby and all of his friends are rednecks, but by the fifth or sixth joke about this, we realize the filmmakers don't have a lot to add to these characters.There was a lot of laughter in the audience. Apparently, the guys in the audience weren't offended by the jokes. I'd be interested to see how the film plays in the South. I'm sure they're relating some of the moments to their buddies at work right now. Or maybe tonight, as they are smashing empty beer cans against their heads while watching football, they might spare a moment to tell them about that `awesome joke' they heard.",3,The Laughs Are Good...

Driven by the absence of fatherly love and the last words his father said to him,""If you ain't first, you're last"", Ricky Bobby is the #1 NASCAR driver in the country.  Racing alongside Ricky is his best friend, Cal Naughton, Jr. (John C. Reilly) who always finishes #2.  Together they are ""Shake N' Bake"".  The owner of Bobby's racing team Mr. Dennit (Pat Hingle) dies and his son, Larry, Jr. (Greg Germann) takes over.  Larry Jr. has always disliked Ricky Bobby and decides to bring a French Formula One driver, Jean Girard (Sacha Baron Cohen) into the NASCAR circuit as part of the Dennit racing team.  After a serious accident, Ricky is left emotionally scarred and unable to race.  His wife kicks Ricky out of the house, divorces him, and marries Cal. Jr.  A few traffic accidents later, Ricky finds himself as a bicycle pizza delivery guy desperately needing a kick in the pants and some inspiration which his long-lost father provides.TALLADEGA NIGHTS is full of humor, both crass and otherwise.  Much of the humor skewers NASCAR and racing fans.  Despite this, the movie is not vicious in its comedy and attitude towards the sport.  Instead, the film seems to carry with it a slight amount of affection towards racing.  Having been raised in a rural area around racing fans, I picked up on many of the over-the-top stereotypes right away, yet was not offended.The movie has a lot of great quotes and contains some brilliant comic acting.  John C. Reilly is one of the best actors in the business, but I would never have pictured him as the sidekick in a Will Ferrell comedy.  Reilly nails the role of Cal Naughton, Jr. and in doing so raised my esteem for him as an actor.  Also worthy of mention is Sacha Baron Cohen as Jean Girard.  Until this film, I had never heard of Cohen, but I've been told that he is an up and coming comical actor to watch.  His performance in TALLADEGA NIGHTS is impressive and has made me want to watch some of his other work, e.g. Ali G.  Michael Clarke Duncan (who is made to look normal-sized through various camera techniques) is also a joy to watch in this film as Ricky's pit manager, Lucius Washington.  The movie also has a simple message that it attempts to deliver (something about not taking the important things in your life for granted), but make no mistake this is a comedy and most of that message is lost through the hilarious quotes and hysterical actions.TALLADEGA NIGHTS is one of the best Will Ferrell films to have been made in the last few years.  Actually, I enjoyed it even better than ANCHORMAN and other movies he has made and consider it my favorite Ferrell film.  It's a hilarious look at NASCAR that tries illustrates a need for speed in life isn't as important as taking time to slow down and enjoy the finer and simpler things in life, such as family.",5,"""Chip!

Unrated? Suitable for anyone 5 years and up if you'd ask me. Ferrell has his comedic moments, sure, he's a great actor. This is more of a dramatic comedy (you know just as well as I do that it's really hard to combine drama and comedy) and the director just doesn't get the job done. Cohen could have been a much stronger, more dramatic character (no pun intended here); I wish they would have cast someone who could pull it off in the role of the arch nemesis. Character development, Ricky's motivations, it's just not as well developed as it should have been to compensate for the lack of comedic tone. Ferrell actually does a commendable job in the dramatic moments - there are many for sure - and I give him credit for that. But after his father puts him back on track for Nascar glory you'd expect a completely off the charts finish. The script disappoints big time with a weak attempt at being funny one last time and have the characters walk to the finish line of the final, Talladega race (disqualifying them both) and having Ricky's long-time best friend finally win it (even though he crashed his car together with - aren't we all surprised - the rest of the pack.

Although I care nothing about NASCAR and everything about basketball. This movie has its moments. But, all in all, it isn't good. The jokes are recycled again and again. And again. Definately worth seeing once; definately not worth owning.It starts out with great potential: ""If you ain't first, your last"". What a saying. But it goes downhill and is really not that funny. The movie drags on and becomes boringly predictable.Even people who worship Will Ferrell will find this movie not worth owning. I know because I saw it with two people who view anything Will Ferrell does as gold. Except this.And, to prove that isn't a good movie, Sony had to release an unrated and uncut version. If you have to resort to more cursing or sex or violence, you didn't do a good job to begin with. The movie should carry itself without the need to add that extra stuff. Anytime you see ""Unrated"", you know the movie is lacking somewhere.If you got this movie with your PS3, fine. You didn't have to pay for a subpar movie.

1024610,AHTEDRC5XLKK0,B000J3OTO6,"WebViking ""WebViking""","[3, 7]","Talladega Nights is not a movie that is going to take itself very seriously, and if you are looking for a fun, entertaining movie, this one's not a bad choice.  If you are looking for something serious or are likely to be offended by a movie that pokes fun at the NASCAR crowd or the French, you might want to watch something else.  This movie is also a vehicle for Will Ferrell, and if you don't like Will Ferell, you're probably not going to like this movie.I mostly like Will Ferrell, so I mostly liked this movie.  And NASCAR is about as good a match for Ferrell's comedy as you are probably ever going to find.  NASCAR race driver Ricky Bobby was a role that he was born to play.  The only problem with Ferrell's humor is sometimes he takes things to far, milking what was kind of funny for far longer than necessary to squeeze as much out of it as possible.  Saying grace to ""baby Jesus"" and running around in his underwear screaming about the ""invisible fire"" are two gags that Ferell goes way overboard on in this movie.  In and of themselves, they were funny, and if they'd spent half the time on them, they would have been even funnier.But still Talladega Nights is, most of the time a very funny movie.  Ferrell in ""Autograph Mode"" is hilarious, his telephone conversations with his friend who stole his job, wife and house, and where he keeps forgetting that his friend is now his worst enemy are hilarious.  And what's even better is that Ferell is surrounded by a great comedic cast in this movie.  From his absentee, pot-smoking, alcoholic father, to his Granny-Law laying down mom, to his two anarchy loving boys, his blonde air-head ex wife, and his ""Shake and Bake"" best friend, they assembled a really great cast around Ferrell.  And in a masterstroke provided Sacha Baron Cohen to play the arch-enemy French driver, Jean Girard, who comes in and dominates NASCAR.  Cohen is perfect in this role.I also have to say something about the cinematography, as this was a film about NASCAR, and great camera work of something that is as much of a spectacle as a couple hundred tons of steel rocketing around a race track at well over a hundred miles an hour is a huge added bonus to this movie.  The aerial shots of the race tracks prior to the races, and some of the awesome camera work of the races themselves sure made up to NASCAR any damage that film makers caused by poking fun at them.  My understanding is that NASCAR was very supportive of this movie, which seems strange because the movie is such a parody of NASCAR.  You wouldn't think that NASCAR would go along with a movie that tries so hard to ridicule it.  I've never been to a NASCAR race or really had any inclination to go to one, but after seeing some of the camera work in this movie, I might think twice about going someday.  They did as good a job capturing some of the flavor NASCAR in this movie as Grand Prix or Le Mans did for Formula 1 in the 60's and 70's, and that's saying a lot.  So call NASCAR dumb as a fox for going along with this movie.One shot in particular stands out, and that's of the final race where Ricky Bobby starts at the back of the field.  I know it's primarily a CGI shot, but I bring it up only because it was so spectacular.  The camera starts out well behind and high above Ricky Bobby's moving car, zooms in and down, catches up to the car until you can see in through the back windshield.  It continues right along the side of the car so that you can clearly see that Will Ferrell is driving the car, then swings up over the hood of the car, still focused on Ferrell through the windshield and zooms ahead and high above the car in one continuous shot.  Just a phenomenal shot even if it is CGI (probably astronomically expensive too), but it's typical of the camera work around the races, and really an added plus to my enjoyment of this movie.So all in all, a pretty good comedy, with some true belly laughs, and the added bonus of some fantastic camera work around the races.",4,A Decent Comedy with a Surprising Bonus,1170028800,"01 29, 2007",2007,3995,"['Talladega', 'Nights', 'not', 'movie', 'going', 'take', 'very', 'seriously', 'are', 'looking', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'one', 'not', 'bad', 'choice', 'are', 'looking', 'something', 'serious', 'are', 'likely', 'be', 'offended', 'movie', 'fun', 'NASCAR', 'crowd', 'French', 'might', 'want', 'watch', 'something', 'else', 'movie', 'also', 'vehicle', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Will', 'Ferell', ""'re"", 'probably', 'not', 'going', 'like', 'movie.I', 'mostly', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'mostly', 'liked', 'movie', 'NASCAR', 'as', 'good', 'match', 'Ferrell', 'comedy', 'are', 'probably', 'ever', 'going', 'find', 'NASCAR', 'race', 'driver', 'Ricky', 'Bobby', 'was', 'role', 'was', 'born', 'play', 'only', 'problem', 'Ferrell', 'humor', 'sometimes', 'things', 'far', 'milking', 'what', 'was', 'kind', 'funny', 'far', 'longer', 'necessary', 'squeeze', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'Saying', 'grace', 'baby', 'Jesus', 'running', 'around', 'underwear', 'screaming', 'invisible', 'fire', 'are', 'two', 'gags', 'Ferell', 'way', 'overboard', 'movie', 'were', 'funny', ""'d"", 'spent', 'time', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'funnier.But', 'still', 'Talladega', 'Nights', 'most', 'time', 'very', 'funny', 'movie', 'Ferrell', 'Autograph', 'Mode', 'hilarious', 'telephone', 'conversations', 'friend', 'who', 'stole', 'job', 'wife', 'house', 'where', 'forgetting', 'friend', 'now', 'worst', 'enemy', 'are', 'hilarious', 'what', 'even', 'better', 'Ferell', 'surrounded', 'great', 'comedic', 'cast', 'movie', 'absentee', 'pot-smoking', 'alcoholic', 'father', 'Granny-Law', 'laying', 'down', 'mom', 'two', 'anarchy', 'loving', 'boys', 'blonde', 'air-head', 'ex', 'wife', 'Shake', 'Bake', 'best', 'friend', 'assembled', 'really', 'great', 'cast', 'around', 'Ferrell', 'masterstroke', 'provided', 'Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'play', 'arch-enemy', 'French', 'driver', 'Jean', 'Girard', 'who', 'dominates', 'NASCAR', 'Cohen', 'perfect', 'role.I', 'also', 'have', 'say', 'something', 'cinematography', 'was', 'film', 'NASCAR', 'great', 'camera', 'work', 'something', 'as', 'much', 'spectacle', 'couple', 'hundred', 'tons', 'steel', 'rocketing', 'race', 'track', 'well', 'hundred', 'miles', 'hour', 'huge', 'added', 'bonus', 'movie', 'aerial', 'shots', 'race', 'prior', 'races', 'awesome', 'camera', 'work', 'races', 'sure', 'made', 'up', 'NASCAR', 'damage', 'film', 'makers', 'caused', 'poking', 'fun', 'understanding', 'NASCAR', 'was', 'very', 'supportive', 'movie', 'strange', 'movie', 'such', 'parody', 'NASCAR', 'would', ""n't"", 'think', 'NASCAR', 'would', 'go', 'along', 'movie', 'so', 'hard', 'ridicule', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'NASCAR', 'race', 'really', 'had', 'inclination', 'go', 'one', 'seeing', 'camera', 'work', 'movie', 'might', 'think', 'twice', 'about', 'going', 'someday', 'did', 'as', 'good', 'job', 'capturing', 'flavor', 'NASCAR', 'movie', 'Grand', 'Prix', 'Le', 'Mans', 'did', 'Formula', '1', '60', '70', 'saying', 'lot', 'call', 'NASCAR', 'dumb', 'fox', 'going', 'along', 'movie.One', 'shot', 'particular', 'stands', 'out', 'final', 'race', 'where', 'Ricky', 'Bobby', 'back', 'field', 'know', 'primarily', 'CGI', 'shot', 'bring', 'up', 'only', 'was', 'so', 'spectacular', 'camera', 'out', 'well', 'high', 'Ricky', 'Bobby', 'moving', 'car', 'zooms', 'down', 'car', 'can', 'see', 'back', 'windshield', 'right', 'side', 'car', 'so', 'can', 'clearly', 'see', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'driving', 'car', 'then', 'swings', 'up', 'hood', 'car', 'still', 'focused', 'Ferrell', 'windshield', 'zooms', 'ahead', 'high', 'car', 'one', 'continuous', 'shot', 'Just', 'phenomenal', 'shot', 'even', 'CGI', 'probably', 'astronomically', 'expensive', 'too', 'typical', 'camera', 'work', 'races', 'really', 'added', 'plus', 'enjoyment', 'movie.So', 'pretty', 'good', 'comedy', 'true', 'belly', 'added', 'bonus', 'fantastic', 'camera', 'work', 'races']",N/A
