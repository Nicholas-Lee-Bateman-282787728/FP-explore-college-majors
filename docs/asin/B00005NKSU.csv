669215,A1G2G3BIPVUUGL,B00005NKSU,Arlene Montemayor,"[13, 13]","""Catfish in Black Bean Sauce"" is a truly heart-warming movie. It's a story of a vietnamese male (the protagonist) who fell inlove with a beautiful black woman. Apparently, he was brought up by a nice African-American couple. The story breaks the ""stereotype"" among Asian-Americans as well as African-Americans. Some of the characters in the story were great ,and they also play significant roles in the movie. Although, there were conflicts in the beginning,it shows that people of different cultures can live together in perfect harmony (By the way, there are also Caucasian actors in the movie, so it's not just a movie about Asians and blacks).There are several reasons you should buy this movie:1. It's entertaining2. It has humor3. The story is interesting (not common)4. Great acting5. and finally, it might open the minds of close-minded people.Why can't Hollywood producers make more movies like this???",5,IMPRESSIVE!!!!!,1123113600,"08 4, 2005",2005,911,"['Catfish', 'Black', 'Bean', 'Sauce', 'truly', 'heart-warming', 'movie', 'story', 'vietnamese', 'male', 'protagonist', 'who', 'fell', 'inlove', 'beautiful', 'black', 'woman', 'Apparently', 'was', 'brought', 'up', 'nice', 'African-American', 'couple', 'story', 'stereotype', 'Asian-Americans', 'as', 'well', 'African-Americans', 'characters', 'story', 'were', 'great', 'also', 'play', 'significant', 'roles', 'movie', 'were', 'conflicts', 'beginning', 'people', 'different', 'cultures', 'can', 'live', 'together', 'perfect', 'harmony', 'way', 'are', 'also', 'Caucasian', 'actors', 'movie', 'not', 'just', 'movie', 'Asians', 'blacks', 'are', 'several', 'reasons', 'should', 'buy', 'movie:1', 'entertaining2', 'humor3', 'story', 'interesting', 'not', 'common', '4', 'Great', 'acting5', 'finally', 'might', 'open', 'minds', 'close-minded', 'people.Why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'Hollywood', 'producers', 'make', 'more', 'movies']",Catfish in Black Bean Sauce

669219,A3AEF59DUCKMQC,B00005NKSU,"E. Laway ""Lady E""","[20, 21]","I found this movie by way of &quot;DVD Deals,&quot; and what a deal, you really get you money's worth.  What a nice discovery, but sad that many people won't really know about this low budget movie.  First of all, I found it amazing that quit a few, seasoned and famous actors participated in this low budget movie, like Paul Winfield (recently deceased at a young age of 62), Alice Walker and Sanaa Latham.  This is one of the reasons why this movie suceeds because the actors are aptly able to convey a seemingly implausible storyline:  A black couple adopts a Vietnamese brother and sister who are all grown-up and searching for their identities.  The flash backs really works in explaining how these characters ended up with each other.  It is a tender love story between uncondtional parents and their children whose commitment to what family really means endures even the most challenging hurdles.  This comes in a form of a long lost Vietnamese mother and the uncertainties of falling in love.  Sometimes this movie resolves in comic one liners that seemed out of place, but if you think about it, it is a bit of a relief from the seriousness of the moment.  I like this movie a lot even though it has some awkward moments because it is very sincere in potraying its characters so keenly that even if it is not a perfect movie, you ended up caring about the characters.

669220,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B00005NKSU,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[4, 4]","I had first watched ""Catfish and Black Bean Soup""  a couple of years ago on the Black Stars channel, after seeing it I thought it was pretty good. While browsing through amazons independent film the name came up as part of its listing and I was thrilled because I liked the movie so much.  Every time it came on Starz  I would watch it because it was so hilarious.""Catfish and Black Bean Soup"" is told in current times, fantasy-dream mode, and childhood flashbacks. At times scenes may seem like clich&eacute;, yet I laughed.  I was hooked into the whirl of it all. This movie has all the spices required in making it an interesting independent film. It takes a humorous approach on cultural and gender differences without making you feel that it's ""yesterday"" story. Chi Muoi Lo did an excellent job for a first-timer on this film. And I loved the chemistry between the African-American couple and between the entire cast in general. I was also impressed that the movie was filmed in a slightly different approach and conversations were cut off to keep the audience wondering what really did happened. Since some things weren't completely explained, it left the audience the chance to use their own reflections on what was going on between the people.... very intelligent. Not only was it dead serious at times but a cute comedy as well.It's a spicy dish -- a real mix of various types and levels of relationships: mother-son, mother-daughter, brother-sister, Asian-Black, husband-wife, roommates, in-laws, young loves -- diversity filled to the brim. There's also warmth, conflicts, misgivings and forgiving's, with a lot of heart! See it to taste it. I definitely would recommend this film.",5,A Tasteful and Delightful Film,1137110400,"01 13, 2006",2006,1693,"['had', 'first', 'watched', 'Catfish', 'Black', 'Bean', 'Soup', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'Black', 'Stars', 'channel', 'seeing', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'browsing', 'amazons', 'independent', 'film', 'name', 'came', 'up', 'part', 'listing', 'was', 'thrilled', 'liked', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'Every', 'time', 'came', 'Starz', 'would', 'watch', 'was', 'so', 'hilarious', 'Catfish', 'Black', 'Bean', 'Soup', 'told', 'current', 'times', 'fantasy-dream', 'mode', 'childhood', 'flashbacks', 'times', 'scenes', 'may', 'seem', 'clich', 'eacute', 'laughed', 'was', 'hooked', 'whirl', 'movie', 'spices', 'required', 'making', 'interesting', 'independent', 'film', 'humorous', 'approach', 'cultural', 'gender', 'differences', 'making', 'feel', 'yesterday', 'story', 'Chi', 'Muoi', 'Lo', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'first-timer', 'film', 'loved', 'chemistry', 'African-American', 'couple', 'entire', 'cast', 'general', 'was', 'also', 'impressed', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'slightly', 'different', 'approach', 'conversations', 'were', 'cut', 'off', 'keep', 'audience', 'wondering', 'what', 'really', 'did', 'happened', 'things', 'were', ""n't"", 'completely', 'explained', 'left', 'audience', 'chance', 'use', 'own', 'reflections', 'was', 'going', 'people', 'very', 'intelligent', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'dead', 'serious', 'times', 'cute', 'comedy', 'well.It', 'spicy', 'dish', 'real', 'mix', 'various', 'types', 'levels', 'relationships', 'mother-son', 'mother-daughter', 'brother-sister', 'Asian-Black', 'husband-wife', 'roommates', 'in-laws', 'young', 'loves', 'diversity', 'filled', 'brim', 'also', 'warmth', 'conflicts', 'misgivings', 'forgiving', 'lot', 'heart', 'See', 'taste', 'definitely', 'would', 'recommend', 'film']",Catfish in Black Bean Sauce

The saying, &quot;it's not where you're from it's where you're at&quot; comes to mind when describing this movie. The movie is about two Vietnamese children who are adopted by a black couple. The movie does a wonderful job of showing how the family's present day interractions with each other came to be with a series of flashbacks, as well as the complexities of intteracial adoption. Humour is interwoven in good measure which really makes the movie very entertaining. This is definitely one for my collection.Aside from some mild cursing, I would even say this is a good family movie (too complex for anyone under 13). All the actors/actresses in this movie should take a bow.
