1428716,AAZRWLML88IZK,B004UXUUDA,A kids review,"[1, 1]","The first thing one might be inclined to say about Sarah's Key after hearing its premise is, ""Oh, another Holocaust movie?"" While this is true, I will tell you that this one is certainly worth watching. Somewhat of a two-part film, the first half of Sarah's Key focuses on the titular Sarah, a young Jewish girl living in France who falls victim to the Vel' d'Hiv Roundup in 1942, wherein French police in German-occupied Paris rounded up Jewish families to be shipped off to Auschwitz; Sarah is able to escape, but not in time to save her little brother, and this haunts her until her death as an adult. In the present day, an American journalist learns that her French husband has inherited the same apartment where young Sarah once lived, and she begins an investigation into the apartment's past that uncovers Sarah's history. I found the film absorbing and impeccably acted all around, even if it had a few minor plot issues. Sarah's Key may not be the definitive Holocaust film, but it's one that will engage you until the credits roll.",3,Sarah's Key,1323475200,"12 10, 2011",2011,1042,"['first', 'thing', 'one', 'might', 'be', 'inclined', 'say', 'Sarah', 'Key', 'hearing', 'premise', 'Oh', 'Holocaust', 'movie', 'true', 'will', 'tell', 'one', 'certainly', 'worth', 'watching', 'Somewhat', 'two-part', 'film', 'first', 'half', 'Sarah', 'Key', 'titular', 'Sarah', 'young', 'Jewish', 'girl', 'living', 'France', 'who', 'victim', 'Vel', ""d'Hiv"", 'Roundup', '1942', 'wherein', 'French', 'police', 'German-occupied', 'Paris', 'rounded', 'up', 'Jewish', 'families', 'be', 'shipped', 'Auschwitz', 'Sarah', 'able', 'escape', 'not', 'time', 'save', 'little', 'brother', 'death', 'adult', 'present', 'day', 'American', 'journalist', 'French', 'husband', 'inherited', 'same', 'apartment', 'where', 'young', 'Sarah', 'once', 'lived', 'investigation', 'apartment', 'past', 'Sarah', 'history', 'found', 'film', 'absorbing', 'impeccably', 'acted', 'even', 'had', 'few', 'minor', 'plot', 'issues', 'Sarah', 'Key', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'definitive', 'Holocaust', 'film', 'one', 'will', 'engage', 'credits', 'roll']",N/A
1428717,A1LMBOI3T91P87,B004UXUUDA,Allan M. Lees,"[1, 1]","Other reviewers have covered the plot of Sarah's Key admirably, and commented on the differences between the book and the movie. I simply want to concur with the sentiments of several reviewers who have said that this is an outstanding film on a subject of great importance. The marketing dollars and special effects budgets spent on Hollywood fare are largely wasted; the productions are ephemeral and insignificant, pablum for the brain at best and a waste of precious minutes at worst. Sarah's Key, in contrast, is worth every moment of attention. The acting, script, camerawork and direction are all top-form. The subject matter is painful, disturbing, uncomfortable - and essential.Humanity is, at times, bestial. At times of disruption (war, revolution) the weak, the cunning, the ruthless and the amoral all rise to power and for some time lord it over ordinary people whose very tendency to keep their heads down, hope for the best, and not stand up against injustice means that inevitably they will be sheep to the slaughter-house. In Sarah's Key we see vividly how ordinary French people enthusiastically collaborated with the Nazi occupiers to rid France of its Jewish citizens. The French, naturally, prefer to forget this moment in their history - but forgetting merely makes it all the easier for such horrors to recur at a later date. And we must understand, each one of us, that every country, every race, every people at every time is susceptible to such horrors. All it takes is a little social disruption and a powerful voice saying ""do this"" and we, the consumate herd animal, will obey. We will wreak harm on our neighbors. The insecure, the repressed, the bitter, the uneducated, the dregs - they will rise and assume power and everyone else will fall meekly into line. Unless we remember, and very early in the process stand against such things. Movies like Sarah's Key remind generations who were born after World War II that life is more complex and more dark than Disney would have us believe, and we need to pay attention to what's going on around us if we're not to wake up and realize we ourselves participated in a horror.If you need a history lesson, Sarah's Key is a great way to begin.",5,Lest We Forget,1332633600,"03 25, 2012",2012,2218,"['Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'covered', 'plot', 'Sarah', 'Key', 'admirably', 'commented', 'differences', 'book', 'movie', 'simply', 'want', 'concur', 'sentiments', 'several', 'reviewers', 'who', 'have', 'said', 'outstanding', 'film', 'subject', 'great', 'importance', 'marketing', 'dollars', 'special', 'effects', 'budgets', 'spent', 'Hollywood', 'fare', 'are', 'largely', 'wasted', 'productions', 'are', 'ephemeral', 'insignificant', 'pablum', 'brain', 'best', 'waste', 'precious', 'minutes', 'worst', 'Sarah', 'Key', 'contrast', 'worth', 'moment', 'attention', 'acting', 'script', 'camerawork', 'direction', 'are', 'top-form', 'subject', 'matter', 'painful', 'disturbing', 'uncomfortable', 'essential.Humanity', 'times', 'bestial', 'times', 'disruption', 'war', 'revolution', 'weak', 'cunning', 'ruthless', 'amoral', 'rise', 'power', 'time', 'lord', 'ordinary', 'people', 'very', 'tendency', 'keep', 'heads', 'down', 'hope', 'best', 'not', 'stand', 'up', 'injustice', 'inevitably', 'will', 'be', 'sheep', 'slaughter-house', 'Sarah', 'Key', 'see', 'vividly', 'how', 'ordinary', 'French', 'people', 'enthusiastically', 'collaborated', 'Nazi', 'occupiers', 'rid', 'France', 'Jewish', 'citizens', 'French', 'naturally', 'prefer', 'forget', 'moment', 'history', 'forgetting', 'merely', 'easier', 'such', 'horrors', 'recur', 'later', 'date', 'must', 'understand', 'one', 'country', 'race', 'people', 'time', 'susceptible', 'such', 'horrors', 'little', 'social', 'disruption', 'powerful', 'voice', 'saying', 'do', 'consumate', 'herd', 'animal', 'will', 'obey', 'will', 'wreak', 'harm', 'neighbors', 'insecure', 'repressed', 'bitter', 'uneducated', 'dregs', 'will', 'rise', 'assume', 'power', 'everyone', 'else', 'will', 'fall', 'meekly', 'line', 'remember', 'very', 'early', 'process', 'stand', 'such', 'things', 'Movies', 'Sarah', 'Key', 'remind', 'generations', 'who', 'were', 'born', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'life', 'more', 'complex', 'more', 'dark', 'Disney', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'need', 'pay', 'attention', 'what', 'going', ""'re"", 'not', 'wake', 'up', 'realize', 'participated', 'horror.If', 'need', 'history', 'lesson', 'Sarah', 'Key', 'great', 'way', 'begin']",N/A

1428720,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B004UXUUDA,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","A story that will chill you, `Sarah's Key' is a beautifully composed film about a terrible secret that consumes the life of a middle aged journalist.  Recently moved to Paris with her husband, Julia is researching the Vel d'Hiv round up for a piece in her magazine.  The French atrocity took place in Paris in the early 40's when Jews were collected en mass and sent to concentration camps.  The treatment and conditions subjected to these men and women (and children) were horrific, and all the more alarming considering that it stemmed from the French and not the Nazis.`Sarah's Key' is siphoned between two stories, that of Julia's discovery and that of a young girl named Sarah, who was sucked into the Vel d'Hiv round up as a child.  Scared and unknowing, Sarah makes a grave mistake by locking her young brother in the closet of her home, assuming that the men at her front door are going to harm him.  When she and her mother and eventually her father become part of the round up, her fears turn even more morbid as she realizes her brother may never get out of that closet (which she locked from the outside).  She then makes it her goal to escape the camp she's placed in and make her way back to her brother.  Julia, in present day Paris, happens to be living in the very same apartment where Sarah's brother was trapped all those years ago.  The apartment belonged to her husband's family, which stirs up anger and resentment and guilt in Julia as she questions their foreknowledge of the Vel d'Hiv round up itself.The performances here are all noteworthy.  Kristen Scott Thomas is outstanding as Julia.  I've always loved this woman, and here she proves why.  Her body language alone is just transcending.  She knows how to use her limbs in a way that emote so much, whether they be tense or loose; she carries them perfectly.  Young Melusine Mayance is wonderful as Sarah, capturing so much pain and remorse in her young eyes.  I may have been most moved by Natasha Mashkevich, though, who was spectacular as Sarah's young mother.  The worry, the pain, the fear, the undying love and devotion; it all embeds itself on her beautiful face.In the end, `Sarah's Key' is a great film.  It is heartbreaking (get ready to cry, you will) and it is moving.  I felt that the treatment of Julia's character could have been tighter, considering that her character arc seems rather unprecedented when you engage the entire scope of what she was learning.  Her marital failings were unnecessary and didn't add to the heart of the film, but they didn't take too much away either.  Still, this is an experience that one does well to embrace.And for those of you afraid of subtitles, this one has them for it is a FRENCH film, despite the fact that Kristen Scott Thomas and Aidan Quinn (and even Niels Arestrup) can speak English ;-)",4,Remorse hangs around her neck like a millstone...,1324339200,"12 20, 2011",2011,2829,"['story', 'will', 'chill', 'Sarah', 'Key', 'beautifully', 'composed', 'film', 'terrible', 'secret', 'life', 'middle', 'aged', 'journalist', 'Recently', 'moved', 'Paris', 'husband', 'Julia', 'researching', 'Vel', ""d'Hiv"", 'round', 'up', 'piece', 'magazine', 'French', 'atrocity', 'took', 'place', 'Paris', 'early', '40', 'when', 'Jews', 'were', 'collected', 'en', 'mass', 'sent', 'concentration', 'camps', 'treatment', 'conditions', 'subjected', 'men', 'women', 'children', 'were', 'horrific', 'more', 'alarming', 'considering', 'stemmed', 'French', 'not', 'Nazis.', 'Sarah', 'Key', 'siphoned', 'two', 'stories', 'Julia', 'discovery', 'young', 'girl', 'named', 'Sarah', 'who', 'was', 'sucked', 'Vel', ""d'Hiv"", 'round', 'up', 'child', 'Scared', 'unknowing', 'Sarah', 'grave', 'mistake', 'locking', 'young', 'brother', 'closet', 'home', 'assuming', 'men', 'front', 'door', 'are', 'going', 'harm', 'When', 'mother', 'eventually', 'father', 'become', 'part', 'round', 'up', 'turn', 'even', 'more', 'morbid', 'brother', 'may', 'never', 'get', 'closet', 'locked', 'outside', 'then', 'goal', 'escape', 'camp', 'placed', 'make', 'way', 'back', 'brother', 'Julia', 'present', 'day', 'Paris', 'be', 'living', 'very', 'same', 'apartment', 'where', 'Sarah', 'brother', 'was', 'trapped', 'years', 'ago', 'apartment', 'belonged', 'husband', 'family', 'up', 'anger', 'resentment', 'guilt', 'Julia', 'questions', 'foreknowledge', 'Vel', ""d'Hiv"", 'round', 'up', 'itself.The', 'performances', 'here', 'are', 'noteworthy', 'Kristen', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'outstanding', 'Julia', ""'ve"", 'always', 'loved', 'woman', 'here', 'why', 'body', 'language', 'alone', 'just', 'transcending', 'how', 'use', 'limbs', 'way', 'emote', 'so', 'much', 'be', 'tense', 'loose', 'perfectly', 'Young', 'Melusine', 'Mayance', 'wonderful', 'Sarah', 'capturing', 'so', 'much', 'pain', 'remorse', 'young', 'eyes', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'most', 'moved', 'Natasha', 'Mashkevich', 'though', 'who', 'was', 'spectacular', 'Sarah', 'young', 'mother', 'worry', 'pain', 'fear', 'undying', 'love', 'devotion', 'beautiful', 'face.In', 'end', 'Sarah', 'Key', 'great', 'film', 'heartbreaking', 'get', 'ready', 'cry', 'will', 'moving', 'felt', 'treatment', 'Julia', 'character', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'tighter', 'considering', 'character', 'arc', 'rather', 'unprecedented', 'when', 'engage', 'entire', 'scope', 'what', 'was', 'learning', 'marital', 'failings', 'were', 'unnecessary', 'did', ""n't"", 'add', 'heart', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'either', 'Still', 'experience', 'one', 'well', 'embrace.And', 'afraid', 'subtitles', 'one', 'FRENCH', 'film', 'fact', 'Kristen', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'Aidan', 'Quinn', 'even', 'Niels', 'Arestrup', 'can', 'speak', 'English']",N/A

At first, I found myself enraged at the French collaboration with the Nazis. In Paris, when Jewish families were separated, mothers from children, it was the French soldiers who pulled them apart. Later it was a French soldier who allowed Sarah and her friend to escape under the wire. The poor girl who had hidden her brother in a closet and locked it against the Nazi soldiers, never gave up the idea that she could go back and save him. Fifty years later an American wife of a Frenchman realizes that the family apartment that they will inherit from her husband's family, was part of the ghetto of Paris. She investigates further and finds the name of Sarah's family, its former inhabitants. Thanks to the meticulous record keeping of the Germans she realizes that Sarah and her brother never went to Auschwitz with their parents.She also finds that Sarah moved to the United States. Never giving up on finding Sarah, she also realizes that she is pregnant, something that she had given up on after miscarriages followed the birth of her only child.

1428725,A30TQET02FLSUX,B004UXUUDA,BLACKBOXBLUE,"[79, 89]","FILM RATING:  4 starsThe best movie I've seen in 2011 so far is Sarah's Key (2010). This French-English import is one of those little ""sleeper"" movies that totally surprises you and blows you away when you see it. Sarah's Key has a very emotional core to it that really looks into the human condition from multiple perspectives. And it searches for the ""truth"" within. This is a movie much in the vein of Schindler's List (1993), The Pianist (2002), The Reader (2008), and The English Patient (1996). It's not exactly ""light"" fare. But it's also not quite as dark as Schindler's List or The Pianist. I found the weaving of the two main story lines, one past and one present, to be perfect. It's not always easy for a filmmaker to pull together past and present set stories, with actors playing the same character at various ages, but director Gilles Paquet-Brenner found a way to do it brilliantly. And the same can be said for the way he weaves together both French and English languages into the movie. I never felt like I was ""working"" to follow the dialogue through reading subtitles. Granted, the movie is only partially subtitled. Parts of it are in English and parts are in French.The story centers around the events of the French round-up of its own Jewish citizens in July 1942. That's right...the French, not the Germans. Of course I'm sure the French were feeling pressure from the Germans during the time. And yet it's hard to overlook the fact that the French were just as guilty of genocide as the Germans and Russians. One can truly understand why there was a ""World"" war at this time. Sarah's Key is simply sharing another piece of the puzzle that we've been reluctant to look at until recently because of how ugly the puzzle is. The impact of this ugly mindset at the time spreading from country to country across the globe must have been like a virus, gradually infecting each host and getting them from within. The opening scenes with the capture of Sarah's family and their move to an internment camp at Auschwitz are gripping to say the least. Sarah, played brilliantly by young actress M&eacute;lusine Mayance, makes a choice on how to save her younger brother from the horrors she anticipates will fall upon them. But that choice has consequences, as we soon find out. I don't want to give too much of the story away, since it is much better to let the movie unfold it for you.Kristin Scott Thomas plays a modern journalist, investigating this historic incident, while at the same time unravelling a very personal and ironic connection to it. The film does require that you let go of what could be too ""coincidental"" for reality. But remember, this is a fictional movie at the end of the day, inspired by real events. And movies by their very nature, are contrived to some degree. I never found myself getting lost in my mind thinking about how unrealistic some of the story arcs were. Instead, I simply felt emotionally engaged in the suspenseful and thrilling discovery of all of the secrets that Sarah's Key possesses. And I credit all of the talented artists who contributed to making that possible in this film. The writing, editing, cinematography, production design, acting, music and sound are top notch for this small indie film rumored to be made for less than $10 million. Sarah's Key is an amazing accomplishment for so little money, and a reminder to Hollywood that it's not the size of the budget of a movie that really matters for its quality. To me its the assembly and collaboration of many talented people unified to tell a great story.There are two scenes that really stand out for me in the film. The first being the opening with Sarah and her brother tickling and giggling with each other under the covers in bed. The director is clearly showing us the innocent fun times of childhood. The camera work there and that little slice of ""happy"" to start the film with are an incredible contrast to the darker more ""adult"" tone of the rest of the film. The second scene that really caught my eye is when Sarah and a fellow young female companion are floating in a murky, muddy river, cleansing themselves. Both of these scenes are just small, idealized, dreamy cinematic sequences that on their own, offer needed artistic moments of escape from the story. Within any horrific context, there's always still something beautiful to be discovered and seen if one looks for it. And director Paquet-Brenner shares that.Music composer Max Richter has created an unbelievably perfect music score for Sarah's Key that not only elevates the film, but is an incredible work to listen to all on its own. The score has mostly a classic sound to it, but Richter also incorporates bits of modern music composition and style as well. It's one of the best film scores I've heard in years. Within the film, the score gives many scenes their emotional gravity, as is typically the case. But something about Richter's music here stands out from the typical score. And you'll know it when you hear it.I could spend a lot more time discussing the themes, ideas and incredible filmmaking prowess present in Sarah's Key, but I firmly believe in letting movies speak for themselves as well. I've given you a little to chew on and hopefully inspire you to see this film, even though on the surface (or by its book cover), Sarah's Key looks like a ""heavy"" film. I challenge you to watch it and grab on to it in some manner. It's movies like this that really give cinema its name. And I'm glad to see that we are still making these films, especially within the broader worldwide cinematic context we are now within.At the end of Sarah's Key, my eyes were red from the tears that flowed throughout the film. And my mind was speechless as I just embraced the very strong emotional connection I felt with the story and the film.

The overused term `Heart-breaking' really only scratches the surface in terms of the deep emotional content (of Loss, torment, regret, guilt, and finally the faint glimmer of hope) that permeates the incredible performances in this film.  It covers the Holocaust period by primarily focusing on a particular Jewish family living in France - and their daughter Sarah who valiantly attempts to hide/Save her younger brother from discovery and deportation to concentration camp, by the Nazis that invaded France, and collaborators (I don't want to give the story away - so I won't go any further into the specifics of this situation).  The film also focuses on incredible actress Kristin Scott-Thomas as the modern-Day intrepid journalist uncovering those traumatic 1942 events that have been both intentionally hidden and/or Lost to the long-mists of time (also with a surprising personal connection to past events).Films like Spielberg's `Schindler's List' go a long way towards helping general audiences to at least partially perceive the importance of `not forgetting' this terrible Epoch (and hopefully not repeating it).  But what makes `Sarah's Key' especially poignant is that by focusing on the particular/ personalized horrors and unimaginable Loss & regret experienced specifically by Sarah herself (as both young girl in France, and later life as a young-adult in America) - you realize that there are really 6 million individual and equally heartbreaking stories of unsuccessful attempts at simple survival (and the mostly futile attempts made to save loved-ones) - and many millions more similarly devastating stories (of non-Jews also) that perished under the most cruel, unforgiving circumstances inflicted during WWII.The Holocaust ultimately is far too complex, intensively horrifying, and emotionally devastating for any mere mortal human to ever fully comprehend (in terms of Why it really happened, and if it could have possibly been prevented or stopped earlier, and also if similar events in the future can somehow be avoided).  But films like `Sarah's Key' still at least give us partial and painfully insightful `glimpses' into some of these specific horrors, individual experiences, and unmitigatingly bleak circumstances - films like these are ultimately very worthy creative endeavors.  Special acting kudos should be given to the ever-charismatic Kristin Scott-Thomas and M&eacute;lusine Mayance, as young Sarah.Note*:  another excellent film in this vein, also with French setting and similar time-period is Louis Malle's ""Au revoir les Enfants"" from 1987.I know that some people find these type films a bit too emotionally wrenching and draining, to watch too often - but there always is the real danger of newer generations forgetting much of this important past, much too quickly - and also the point that filmmaking (in its most ideal sense), should aim above & beyond pure entertainment value - which 'Sarah's Key' most certainly does!",5,Devastatingly Poignant Story of Holocaust Period and its Impact extending to France.,1401840000,"06 4, 2014",2014,3066,"['Sarah', 'Key', 'painfully', 'poignant', 'film', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'adequately', 'described', 'mere', 'words', 'overused', 'term', 'Heart-breaking', 'really', 'only', 'surface', 'terms', 'deep', 'emotional', 'content', 'Loss', 'torment', 'regret', 'guilt', 'finally', 'faint', 'glimmer', 'hope', 'incredible', 'performances', 'film', 'Holocaust', 'period', 'primarily', 'focusing', 'particular', 'Jewish', 'family', 'living', 'France', 'daughter', 'Sarah', 'who', 'valiantly', 'hide/Save', 'younger', 'brother', 'discovery', 'deportation', 'concentration', 'camp', 'Nazis', 'invaded', 'France', 'collaborators', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'story', 'away', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'further', 'specifics', 'situation', 'film', 'also', 'incredible', 'actress', 'Kristin', 'Scott-Thomas', 'modern-Day', 'intrepid', 'journalist', 'uncovering', 'traumatic', '1942', 'events', 'have', 'been', 'intentionally', 'hidden', 'and/or', 'Lost', 'long-mists', 'time', 'also', 'surprising', 'personal', 'connection', 'past', 'events', '.Films', 'Spielberg', 'Schindler', 'List', 'go', 'long', 'way', 'helping', 'general', 'audiences', 'least', 'partially', 'perceive', 'importance', 'not', 'forgetting', 'terrible', 'Epoch', 'hopefully', 'not', 'repeating', 'what', 'Sarah', 'Key', 'especially', 'poignant', 'focusing', 'particular/', 'personalized', 'horrors', 'unimaginable', 'Loss', 'regret', 'experienced', 'specifically', 'Sarah', 'young', 'girl', 'France', 'later', 'life', 'young-adult', 'America', 'realize', 'are', 'really', '6', 'million', 'individual', 'equally', 'heartbreaking', 'stories', 'unsuccessful', 'attempts', 'simple', 'survival', 'mostly', 'futile', 'attempts', 'made', 'save', 'loved-ones', 'many', 'millions', 'more', 'similarly', 'devastating', 'stories', 'non-Jews', 'also', 'perished', 'most', 'cruel', 'unforgiving', 'circumstances', 'inflicted', 'WWII.The', 'Holocaust', 'ultimately', 'far', 'too', 'complex', 'intensively', 'horrifying', 'emotionally', 'devastating', 'mere', 'mortal', 'human', 'ever', 'fully', 'comprehend', 'terms', 'Why', 'really', 'happened', 'could', 'have', 'possibly', 'been', 'prevented', 'stopped', 'earlier', 'also', 'similar', 'events', 'future', 'can', 'somehow', 'be', 'avoided', 'films', 'Sarah', 'Key', 'still', 'least', 'give', 'partial', 'painfully', 'insightful', 'glimpses', 'specific', 'horrors', 'individual', 'experiences', 'unmitigatingly', 'bleak', 'circumstances', 'films', 'are', 'ultimately', 'very', 'worthy', 'creative', 'endeavors', 'Special', 'acting', 'kudos', 'should', 'be', 'given', 'ever-charismatic', 'Kristin', 'Scott-Thomas', 'M', 'eacute', 'lusine', 'Mayance', 'young', 'Sarah.Note*', 'excellent', 'film', 'vein', 'also', 'French', 'setting', 'similar', 'time-period', 'Louis', 'Malle', 'Au', 'revoir', 'Enfants', '1987.I', 'know', 'people', 'find', 'type', 'films', 'bit', 'too', 'emotionally', 'wrenching', 'draining', 'watch', 'too', 'often', 'always', 'real', 'danger', 'newer', 'generations', 'forgetting', 'much', 'important', 'past', 'much', 'too', 'quickly', 'also', 'point', 'filmmaking', 'most', 'ideal', 'sense', 'should', 'aim', 'pure', 'entertainment', 'value', ""'Sarah"", 'Key', 'most', 'certainly']",N/A
1428728,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B004UXUUDA,Brian E. Erland,"[0, 1]","Watching films dealing with the theme of the Holocaust are somewhat a necessary evil. ""We must never forget"" is not just an overused slogan, it's an existential imperative. Yes, they are definitely difficult, often times traumatic emotional experiences for the viewer. So much so that one actually feels guilty afterwards admitting that they enjoyed the film. Somehow using the word ""enjoyed"" sounds out of place, callous, or more appropriately blasphemous. Atrocities of this magnitude must be studied, understood and endured, but enjoyed?So keeping in mind the above mentioned sentiments I would like to recommend the 2011 film `Sarah's Key'. Though a fictional tale, the foundation of the story deals with the true account of Frances collaboration with the Nazi's in gathering up the Parisian Jewish population in the infamous Vel d'Hiver Roundup. As one would expect from a film of this nature the events are horrific, heartbreaking and intense. And as far as happy endings go, the wise viewer should be looking more for a little personal insight and hope rather than any rainbows and unicorns.In my estimation the Holocaust theme alone makes `Sarah's Key' worthy of one's time and attention.  However add to that the simple fact that this is a thoughtful, well told, tale perfectly paced to keep the audience focused and fascinated from beginning to end. The acting is wonderful especially little Melusine Mayance as Sarah Starzynski and Kristen Scott Thomas as Julia Jarmond. This is a story that will stay with you. It will make you think, make you reflect, make you ask yourself what if?

In Sarah's Key, a successful journalist becomes entwined in the story and suffering of the holocaust by virtue of her family moving into an apartment that was formerly the home of Jewish tenants in 1942.  These tenants were taken by force and moved first to a stadium for staging, then to a holding camp and finally to a death camp.  The journalist's father-in-law grew up in the apartment and a secret has been kept about what exactly happened when the Jewish family was taken from their home.  The journalist, originally working on the story about French police assisting Nazi occupiers, becomes personally involved when she discovers that a young girl living in the apartment may still be alive.  It becomes her mission to find her and talk to her.  The journalist seems to be looking for some redemption or reconciliation for her family for any abetting that her extended family may have been involved in.  The director deftly flashes back to the historical incidents, from the ouster of the family to their terrible journey to the various camps.  While pursing this project, the journalist discovers she is pregnant.  Her husband, who is middle aged and at a key point in his career, finds the pregnancy terribly inconvenient and wants the wife to abort.  This conflict over life vs. abortion is thus juxtaposed and serves as a background tension to the issues of life and death attached to the story of the Jewish family and the little girl in that family, Sarah.  The film is enveloped in drama that deals with issues of life and death, reconciliation and redemption as well as sacrifice and risk.  It is well worth watching to experience how these issues can come to the fore in various events, both personal and historical.",5,An Apartment with a View to a Secret and Painful Past,1328227200,"02 3, 2012",2012,1856,"['movie', 'was', 'successful', 'effort', 'connect', 'pain', 'suffering', 'Holocaust', 'non-Jewish', 'contemporary', 'person', 'Sarah', 'Key', 'successful', 'journalist', 'becomes', 'entwined', 'story', 'suffering', 'holocaust', 'virtue', 'family', 'moving', 'apartment', 'was', 'formerly', 'home', 'Jewish', 'tenants', '1942', 'tenants', 'were', 'taken', 'force', 'moved', 'first', 'stadium', 'staging', 'then', 'holding', 'camp', 'finally', 'death', 'camp', 'journalist', 'father-in-law', 'grew', 'up', 'apartment', 'secret', 'been', 'kept', 'what', 'exactly', 'happened', 'when', 'Jewish', 'family', 'was', 'taken', 'home', 'journalist', 'originally', 'working', 'story', 'French', 'police', 'assisting', 'Nazi', 'occupiers', 'personally', 'involved', 'when', 'young', 'girl', 'living', 'apartment', 'may', 'still', 'be', 'alive', 'mission', 'find', 'talk', 'journalist', 'be', 'looking', 'redemption', 'reconciliation', 'family', 'abetting', 'extended', 'family', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'involved', 'director', 'deftly', 'back', 'historical', 'incidents', 'ouster', 'family', 'terrible', 'journey', 'various', 'camps', 'pursing', 'project', 'journalist', 'discovers', 'pregnant', 'husband', 'who', 'middle', 'aged', 'key', 'point', 'career', 'pregnancy', 'terribly', 'inconvenient', 'wife', 'abort', 'conflict', 'life', 'vs.', 'abortion', 'thus', 'juxtaposed', 'background', 'tension', 'issues', 'life', 'death', 'attached', 'story', 'Jewish', 'family', 'little', 'girl', 'family', 'Sarah', 'film', 'enveloped', 'drama', 'deals', 'issues', 'life', 'death', 'reconciliation', 'redemption', 'as', 'well', 'sacrifice', 'risk', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'experience', 'how', 'issues', 'can', 'come', 'fore', 'various', 'events', 'personal', 'historical']",N/A

Velasquez,"[1, 2]","The Holocaust is a period in history that should never be forgotten, but, at times, watching current conflicts throughout our planet, we tend to loose faith in the future of our species. That is the reason why powerful and illuminating films like ""Sarah's Key"" are so important: we need to be constantly reminded of the evil that we are capable of doing to each other. This film really touched my heart.The movie starts on July 16, 1942, when Mrs. Starzynski and her two children hear a sudden knocking on the door of their apartment. Once Mrs. Starzynski opens the door, her family's worst nightmare began. Elements of the French government, being servants to the Nazis, kidnapped them, as well as Mr. Starzynski - who was outside the apartment at the time --, in order that they would be sent to the German concentration camps for extermination. But little Sarah Starzynski (M&eacute;lusine Mayance, in an electrifying performance), was able to save her little brother, by hiding him inside a closet, locking it, and keeping the key. She was sure that she was going to be able to come back for him.We are then taken to 2009, when Julia Harmond (Kristin Scott Thomas), her husband Bertrand (Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Pierrot), and their daughter are in the process of moving in to the apartment that was once occupied by the Starzynskis many years ago. However, something sparks Julia's curiosity - she is a journalist, writing about the deportation of Jews in France --, and she begins investigating the apartment's history. Her research, as you can realize, will bring back memories of a sad past, which will affect her in every aspect of her life.Ably directed by Gilles Paquet-Brenner, ""Sarah's Key"" is about the sanctity of life, and how events that happened in 1942 still affect our lives. It was during that year that 13,000 French Jews were removed from their homes and neighborhoods - the Rue de Saintonge, where the apartment is located, being one of them --, and transported in 74 trains to Auschwitz as its final destination. In the end, a total of 76,000 Jews were deported by the French - brother against brother. This is a film that puts the Jewish suffering into a new perspective, with an inspiring, yet tragic and touching story. The movie also stars Aidan Quinn and Charlotte Poutrel.

The eventual outcomes in the lives of Sarah and Julia, whose stories intersect in a single place - an apartment in Paris - can be seen coming from a good distance.This is not so much a straight story, a retelling of a tragedy, and the unraveling of a mystery; rather an account of how we can be haunted - sometimes tragically - by memories of actions done, or left undone, of the unconsidered gesture, the off-hand word and the impulsive action of a moment. Such small words, deeds, gestures can have shattering results, as they play out with the inevitability of a long string of dominoes falling.  It is not the situation, of a young girl caught with her family in the 1942 round-up of Jews in Paris, and the woman writing the story of that round-up years later ... but how it plays out. And Sarah's Key plays out with deceptive simplicity, in wordless scenes, and evocative interiors, most especially in the performances of Kristin Scott Thomas and Melusine Mayance (who must be France's answer to Dakota Fanning.) The 1942 sequences are faultlessly authentic in feeling, and some of the wordless scenes - of two girls walking through a field of wheat, and floating in a silent pool of river are beautiful, in a painterly way.The extras are also worth watching; how location shooting and meals were organized (without nearly as much fuss as their American counterparts would have been), brief  interviews and features focusing on the various actors - none of which save for Kristin Scott Thomas will be familiar to an American audience which again is a nice change. The movie and all the features are in French with English subtitles, so careful attention must be paid.",5,Actions Unconsidered,1324512000,"12 22, 2011",2011,1784,"['should', 'not', 'be', 'necessary', 'recapitulate', 'plot', 'novel', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'upon', 'was', 'widely', 'read', 'eventual', 'outcomes', 'lives', 'Sarah', 'Julia', 'stories', 'intersect', 'single', 'place', 'apartment', 'Paris', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'coming', 'good', 'distance.This', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'straight', 'story', 'retelling', 'tragedy', 'unraveling', 'mystery', 'rather', 'account', 'how', 'can', 'be', 'haunted', 'sometimes', 'tragically', 'memories', 'actions', 'done', 'left', 'undone', 'unconsidered', 'gesture', 'off-hand', 'word', 'impulsive', 'action', 'moment', 'Such', 'small', 'words', 'deeds', 'gestures', 'can', 'have', 'shattering', 'results', 'play', 'out', 'inevitability', 'long', 'string', 'dominoes', 'falling', 'not', 'situation', 'young', 'girl', 'caught', 'family', '1942', 'round-up', 'Jews', 'Paris', 'woman', 'writing', 'story', 'round-up', 'years', 'later', 'how', 'out', 'Sarah', 'Key', 'out', 'deceptive', 'simplicity', 'wordless', 'scenes', 'evocative', 'interiors', 'most', 'especially', 'performances', 'Kristin', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'Melusine', 'Mayance', 'who', 'must', 'be', 'France', 'answer', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', '1942', 'sequences', 'are', 'faultlessly', 'authentic', 'feeling', 'wordless', 'two', 'girls', 'walking', 'field', 'wheat', 'floating', 'silent', 'pool', 'river', 'are', 'beautiful', 'painterly', 'way.The', 'extras', 'are', 'also', 'worth', 'watching', 'how', 'location', 'shooting', 'meals', 'were', 'organized', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'fuss', 'American', 'counterparts', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'brief', 'interviews', 'features', 'focusing', 'various', 'actors', 'none', 'save', 'Kristin', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'will', 'be', 'familiar', 'American', 'audience', 'again', 'nice', 'change', 'movie', 'features', 'are', 'French', 'English', 'subtitles', 'so', 'careful', 'attention', 'must', 'be', 'paid']",N/A

Before the French officials forced them out, Sarah was able to hide her little brother in a locked, concealed closet. When it becomes apparent the family will not be returning home, Sarah's desperation to rescue her brother mounts, and she does everything in her power to get to him.When American journalist Julia (Kristin Scott Thomas) and her French husband begin renovating his family's Paris apartment, Julia learns that the former occupants were part of the 1942. Finding out what happened to Sarah becomes a driving force in her life, and Julia soon uncovers long-hidden family secrets.My take: I generally enjoy World War II movies, so I jumped at the chance to review ""Sarah's Key."" I didn't realize it was a French movie, though (perhaps I should have read the description better!)--so I'm glad I recently got a larger TV, which made reading the subtitles easier!I really liked this film. The fact that it cut back and forth between Sarah's and Julia's stories kept it from getting too heavy. I also appreciated that the filmmakers chose not to go for the ""gross out"" factor in one pivotal scene. Rather than showing a grotesque, decomposing body, they focused on the characters in the scene, which I think made a more powerful impact than showing the body would have.Several fantastic performances really carry this film. Kristin Scott Thomas is great as usual, but the two performances that stick out to me are Niels Arestrup as a Frenchman who takes Sarah under his wing and M&eacute;lusine Mayance as the young Sarah. Mayance in particular is phenomenal, as she completely sells Sarah's horror, determination, and pain.Also of interest is a ""making of"" special on the DVD, which features interviews with the film's director (who claims Mayance is one of the best actresses he's ever worked with) and Tatiana De Rosnay (the author of the book Sarah's Key), as well as a look at the special effects/stunts and the history behind the story.""Sarah's Key"" is easily one of the best World War II films I've seen, and I highly recommend it!",5,Touching WWII mystery,1325116800,"12 29, 2011",2011,2157,"['Sarah', 'M', 'eacute', 'lusine', 'Mayance', 'parents', 'are', 'driven', 'home', '1942', 'Vel', ""d'Hiv"", 'Roundup', 'French', 'officials', 'forced', 'out', 'Sarah', 'was', 'able', 'hide', 'little', 'brother', 'locked', 'concealed', 'closet', 'When', 'apparent', 'family', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'returning', 'home', 'Sarah', 'desperation', 'rescue', 'brother', 'mounts', 'everything', 'power', 'get', 'him.When', 'American', 'journalist', 'Julia', 'Kristin', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'French', 'husband', 'begin', 'renovating', 'family', 'Paris', 'apartment', 'Julia', 'former', 'occupants', 'were', 'part', '1942', 'Finding', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'Sarah', 'driving', 'force', 'life', 'Julia', 'soon', 'long-hidden', 'family', 'secrets.My', 'take', 'generally', 'enjoy', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'movies', 'jumped', 'chance', 'review', 'Sarah', 'Key', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'was', 'French', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'should', 'have', 'read', 'description', 'better', ""'m"", 'glad', 'recently', 'got', 'larger', 'TV', 'made', 'reading', 'subtitles', 'easier', 'really', 'liked', 'film', 'fact', 'cut', 'back', 'forth', 'Sarah', 'Julia', 'stories', 'kept', 'getting', 'too', 'heavy', 'also', 'appreciated', 'filmmakers', 'chose', 'not', 'go', 'gross', 'out', 'factor', 'one', 'pivotal', 'scene', 'Rather', 'showing', 'grotesque', 'decomposing', 'body', 'focused', 'characters', 'scene', 'think', 'made', 'more', 'powerful', 'impact', 'showing', 'body', 'would', 'have.Several', 'fantastic', 'performances', 'really', 'carry', 'film', 'Kristin', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'great', 'usual', 'two', 'performances', 'stick', 'out', 'are', 'Niels', 'Arestrup', 'Frenchman', 'who', 'Sarah', 'wing', 'M', 'eacute', 'lusine', 'Mayance', 'young', 'Sarah', 'Mayance', 'particular', 'phenomenal', 'completely', 'Sarah', 'horror', 'determination', 'pain.Also', 'interest', 'making', 'special', 'DVD', 'interviews', 'film', 'director', 'who', 'Mayance', 'one', 'best', 'ever', 'worked', 'Tatiana', 'De', 'Rosnay', 'author', 'book', 'Sarah', 'Key', 'as', 'well', 'look', 'special', 'effects/stunts', 'history', 'story', 'Sarah', 'Key', 'easily', 'one', 'best', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A

Hitler and Nazism are pretty disgusting and there's no arguing that the entire war was completely devastating, but media that was put out during that time period is something special. Cartoons from this era were put out during the prime of Warner Bros and Disney so they're well animated and hilarious while movies set in this time period always seem to strike a nerve other movies can't even scratch the surface of. Then again, there are times when a movie does everything right other than appeal to your particular interests. Sarah's Key is such a film yet still manages to leave a strong impact.As you can probably imagine, Sarah's Key is kind of a downer. It's safe to say that anything that uses World War II as a backdrop or setting results in it automatically having a depressing atmosphere. There's an engaging aspect to it as well though. Sarah Starzynski (M&eacute;lusine Mayance) locks her brother in their bedroom closet and tells the authorities that he took a trip to the country with their father as the rest of the family is gathered up and sent to a concentration camp as part of the Vel' d'Hiv Roundup in 1942. Meanwhile a journalist in the present named Julia Jarmond (Kristin Scott Thomas) is investigating the events of World War II and is about to be married. On top of an unexpected pregnancy, Julia finds out that the house she's about to inherit belonged to Sarah and her family. While Sarah is dealing with trying to get back to her poor brother trapped in a closet in 1942, Julia is tracking down Sarah's current whereabouts since records indicate she was never sent back to another concentration camp.Everything about Sarah's Key is very solid. The entire cast puts in some gripping performances. M&eacute;lusine Mayance and Kristin Scott Thomas really stand out though. They're both so emotional and driven towards their own set of goals. The writing is superb. Not only does the film transition from the past and present in flawless fashion, but the dialogue is just as impressive. Everything said feels natural as every action taken by on-screen characters seems genuine and feels like something anyone would do in that given situation. There really isn't anything negative to say about Sarah's Key and I can't really argue with anyone who praises the film or calls it a masterpiece. It just didn't seem to affect me the way it did others though. I still recognized the spectacular ending and became a bit white-knuckled once Sarah finally made her way back to what used to be her home, but I didn't love the movie. Without being able to find any flaw in the film, I can only speculate that's because it's a movie that just isn't for me. It just didn't speak to my tastes and interests as I hoped it would.Sarah's Key is a depressing yet intriguing drama that has all the right pieces to a fantastic film and is in some ways an extraordinary piece of cinema. The past and present are unified in an extremely satisfying way and the ending is really incredible, but it comes down to personal preference in the end; Sarah's Key just isn't the type of movie that some people go to the theater for. Nevertheless Sarah's Key is a fascinating journey into the heart of World War II through modern times.",3,"Eloquently acted, but leaves something to be desired",1314921600,"09 2, 2011",2011,3311,"['events', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'something', 'have', 'piqued', 'interest', 'Hitler', 'Nazism', 'are', 'pretty', 'disgusting', 'arguing', 'entire', 'war', 'was', 'completely', 'devastating', 'media', 'was', 'put', 'out', 'time', 'period', 'something', 'special', 'Cartoons', 'era', 'were', 'put', 'out', 'prime', 'Warner', 'Bros', 'Disney', ""'re"", 'well', 'animated', 'hilarious', 'movies', 'set', 'time', 'period', 'always', 'seem', 'strike', 'nerve', 'other', 'movies', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'scratch', 'surface', 'Then', 'again', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'movie', 'everything', 'right', 'other', 'appeal', 'particular', 'interests', 'Sarah', 'Key', 'such', 'film', 'yet', 'still', 'leave', 'strong', 'impact.As', 'can', 'probably', 'imagine', 'Sarah', 'Key', 'kind', 'downer', 'safe', 'say', 'anything', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'backdrop', 'setting', 'results', 'automatically', 'having', 'depressing', 'atmosphere', 'engaging', 'aspect', 'as', 'well', 'Sarah', 'Starzynski', 'M', 'eacute', 'lusine', 'Mayance', 'brother', 'bedroom', 'closet', 'authorities', 'took', 'trip', 'country', 'father', 'rest', 'family', 'gathered', 'up', 'sent', 'concentration', 'camp', 'part', 'Vel', ""d'Hiv"", 'Roundup', '1942', 'Meanwhile', 'journalist', 'present', 'named', 'Julia', 'Jarmond', 'Kristin', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'investigating', 'events', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'be', 'married', 'top', 'unexpected', 'pregnancy', 'Julia', 'out', 'house', 'inherit', 'belonged', 'Sarah', 'family', 'Sarah', 'dealing', 'trying', 'get', 'back', 'poor', 'brother', 'trapped', 'closet', '1942', 'Julia', 'tracking', 'down', 'Sarah', 'current', 'whereabouts', 'records', 'indicate', 'was', 'never', 'sent', 'back', 'concentration', 'camp.Everything', 'Sarah', 'Key', 'very', 'solid', 'entire', 'cast', 'puts', 'gripping', 'performances', 'M', 'eacute', 'lusine', 'Mayance', 'Kristin', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'really', 'stand', 'out', ""'re"", 'emotional', 'driven', 'towards', 'own', 'set', 'goals', 'writing', 'superb', 'Not', 'only', 'film', 'transition', 'past', 'present', 'flawless', 'fashion', 'dialogue', 'just', 'as', 'impressive', 'Everything', 'said', 'feels', 'natural', 'action', 'taken', 'on-screen', 'characters', 'genuine', 'feels', 'something', 'anyone', 'would', 'do', 'given', 'situation', 'really', ""n't"", 'anything', 'negative', 'say', 'Sarah', 'Key', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'argue', 'anyone', 'who', 'film', 'masterpiece', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'affect', 'way', 'did', 'others', 'still', 'recognized', 'spectacular', 'ending', 'became', 'bit', 'white-knuckled', 'once', 'Sarah', 'finally', 'made', 'way', 'back', 'what', 'used', 'be', 'home', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'movie', 'being', 'able', 'find', 'flaw', 'film', 'can', 'only', 'speculate', 'movie', 'just', ""n't"", 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'speak', 'tastes', 'interests', 'hoped', 'would.Sarah', 'Key', 'depressing', 'yet', 'intriguing', 'drama', 'right', 'pieces', 'fantastic', 'film', 'ways', 'extraordinary', 'piece', 'cinema', 'past', 'present', 'are', 'unified', 'extremely', 'satisfying', 'way', 'ending', 'really', 'incredible', 'down', 'personal', 'preference', 'end', 'Sarah', 'Key', 'just', ""n't"", 'type', 'movie', 'people', 'go', 'theater', 'Nevertheless', 'Sarah', 'Key', 'fascinating', 'journey', 'heart', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'modern', 'times']",N/A

Travis,"[0, 0]","A fictionalized, but emotionally powerful drama about a young Jewish girl, Sarah, who was one of 13,000 Jewish emigrants and refugees rounded up by the French police in German-occupied Paris and shipped to Auschwitz. A present day American journalist Julia, played by Kristin Scott Thomas, attempts to unravel events of the past. The film alternates between the past and the present, relating both the ordeal of 10-year-old Sarah Starzynski and that of the present day journalist attempting to find out what happened to Sarah, who Julia knows was not killed at Auschwitz. Intertwined with Sarah's story is a portrait of middle-aged Julia's struggle with her desire to carry to term a ""surprise"" pregnancy that her husband does not want. Several reviewers felt that ""the angst of modern life over-shadows past tragedy"". Granted that Sarah's story (the first two thirds of the movie) is stronger than Julia's (the last third), but I feel that the intertwining of the stories lends strength to the movie. The first part of the film, which focuses on the young Sarah, is unbelievable good (I give it a 5). The second part is about a 3.5.This is not just another holocaust movie, of which there have been so many that they are beginning to lose their impact, but a film focused on the tribulations of two strong-willed, courageous women, a rarity in modern action films. The performances by Kristin Scott Thomas and especially Melusine Mayance (as the young Sarah) will keep you on the edge of your seat. Kristin Scott Thomas received a C&eacute;sar Award nomination for her compelling performance in this role. I think the performance by Mayance as Sarah is the best I have seen by a young actor.

I hate to watch a movie before I've read the book it's based but on it was worth breaking that rule for ""Sarah's Key"".  An almost middle-aged journalist, Julia Jarmond, becomes interested in the Paris apartment she and her husband have inherited from his family.  As they begin to change it for their own use she begins to wonder about its history.  Who owned it before 1942 which is when her husband's family bought it?  This leads her back to a horrible World War II tragedy when she learns the family who owned it then were Jewish and had been taken prisoner by the Nazi's.  The `key' in the book is at the center of that tragedy.  The more Julia digs the more she begins to understand her family's involvement in what happened.  She almost doesn't want to know the truth but bravely keeps digging anyway.  There's a very satisfying ending (though to be honest, right at the end, it was almost ruined but they made it work).  The people and their situations and emotions ring true without being overdone.The overall theme of the movie seems to be that no one, on any side of the Atlantic, was blameless in this war.  Looking away in order to save yourself and your property implicates you.....it's just a matter of degree and that gray area is where this movie plays out.  Kristin Scott Thomas was superb in this movie as was Frederic Pierrot who played her father-in-law though he has much less screen time.

1428741,ADM7CHQGQHXKU,B004UXUUDA,Dawn Kessinger,"[3, 5]","I had just finished reading the book when I sat down to watch the movie Sarah's Key. I understand how movies are based on the book, not scripted exactly on every word and scene of the book. But I was deeply disappointed with the changes made to the movie that changed the depth and meaning of the book.Some of the changes are small and didn't really matter or bother me much (the difference between the guard who helped Sarah in the book and the guard in the movie, for example; or the differences of how someone escaped in the book vs. the movie). Other changes felt huge to me - Julia, the American journalist living in Paris, doing research for an assignment and eventually searching out what happened to Sarah, felt warm, compassionate, with depth and humility in the book. In the movie, I found her cold, sometimes snobbish and superior (in the movie she knows all about the roundup of the Jews, whereas in the book, she knows very little and is ashamed - part of the meaning of the book was how she wanted to find Sarah to tell her she's sorry she didn't know ... all of this is stripped away in the movie). The lack of involvement with other characters really takes away from the character Julia, also, makes her seem shallow and selfish. Zoe, her daughter, is barely there in the movie and I found myself really missing her (in the book, she's amazing). Her sister is not supportive at all and has one line in the movie (in the book, again, she is an important supporting character).And then we have Sarah, a Jewish child who at 10 is arrested with her parents and goes through one horrible tragedy after another. Sarah is portrayed fairly well, though so much is left out about her thoughts, feelings, and questions (which I admit are probably difficult to transfer from how a book explains them so well, to movie form). Again, I disagreed with some changes made from the book - it would not have taken more time to explain or needed more money to make the movie to NOT alter some key points made in the novel. I loved the book so much that these changes in the movie made me dislike it more than I may have if I'd never read the book.Another thing I felt was handled well in the movie was the quick time changes, between Sarah's life in 1942 (and onward as her story unfolds), and Julia's life in 2009.

1428742,AOS5ZBTQX7QIT,B004UXUUDA,D. Barbour,"[9, 26]","First, I didn't hate this movie.  This summary won't contain spoilers because it's worth seeing if only for the acting.  I am very big fan of Kristen Scott Thomas.  Her work inI've Loved You So Long [Blu-ray]was Oscar-worthy.  Her acting here is no-less perfect, but the script she is working suffers from a lack of common sense.  The story of French Jews deported into the hands of Nazis is worth telling, but the way it's done here is awkward and fragmented.  The present day mystery angle, where Thomas comes in, is also interesting, but the writer delved into scenes that truly wore on my patience.  For instance, when she is trying to track down a certain character in present day New York City, she has to take a cab from address to address to address trying to find who she is looking for.  Why could she have not used a telephone and saved herself the time?  Also, she has to fly all over the world to see some people, where she could have just done it either on the phone, e-mail, etc.  If the mystery portion of the film was set pre-Internet, than maybe I could buy more of this.  Also, when a group of characters make a discovery in an apartment, children are present in a moment where no adult in their right mind would allow them to be.  It was quite ludicrous.  So while this film gets high marks for acting and cinematography, don't expect to love it - and DO expect to roll your eyes quite a bit. 2.5 out of 5.",2,Great Acting With a VERY Flawed Script,1313884800,"08 21, 2011",2011,1426,"['First', 'did', ""n't"", 'hate', 'movie', 'summary', 'wo', ""n't"", 'contain', 'spoilers', 'worth', 'seeing', 'only', 'acting', 'am', 'very', 'big', 'fan', 'Kristen', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'work', 'inI', ""'ve"", 'Loved', 'So', 'Long', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'was', 'Oscar-worthy', 'acting', 'here', 'no-less', 'perfect', 'script', 'working', 'suffers', 'lack', 'common', 'sense', 'story', 'French', 'Jews', 'deported', 'hands', 'Nazis', 'worth', 'telling', 'way', 'done', 'here', 'awkward', 'fragmented', 'present', 'day', 'mystery', 'angle', 'where', 'Thomas', 'also', 'interesting', 'writer', 'delved', 'scenes', 'truly', 'wore', 'patience', 'instance', 'when', 'trying', 'track', 'down', 'certain', 'character', 'present', 'day', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'take', 'cab', 'address', 'address', 'address', 'trying', 'find', 'who', 'looking', 'Why', 'could', 'have', 'not', 'used', 'telephone', 'saved', 'time', 'Also', 'fly', 'world', 'see', 'people', 'where', 'could', 'have', 'just', 'done', 'phone', 'e-mail', 'etc', 'mystery', 'portion', 'film', 'was', 'set', 'pre-Internet', 'maybe', 'could', 'buy', 'more', 'Also', 'when', 'group', 'characters', 'make', 'discovery', 'apartment', 'children', 'are', 'present', 'moment', 'where', 'adult', 'right', 'mind', 'would', 'allow', 'be', 'was', 'quite', 'ludicrous', 'So', 'film', 'high', 'marks', 'acting', 'cinematography', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'love', 'DO', 'expect', 'roll', 'eyes', 'quite', 'bit', '2.5', '5']",N/A
1428743,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,B004UXUUDA,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[2, 3]","This big screen adaptation of Tatiana De Rosnay's novel ""Sarah's Key,"" directed by Gilles Paquet-Brenner in some way presents the Holocaust awareness message with greater simplicity and impact than its written counterpart.  However, sadly, both the novel and the film's major plot line of Sarah and her key is rectified around the halfway mark of both pieces. As the murkier central story of a journalist whose marital issues and unplanned pregnancy shifts the mass horror of the Vel D'Hiv roundup into the smaller arena of moving past personal tragedy, the significance of the message seems less intense, diluted by one woman's trouble and some trite classroom telling instead of being the sole monumentally emotional grab of the piece. In that sense, the incident seems marginalized in the face of smaller personal issues that effect a few not thousands.Not that the overall feeling of the film is any different from the book.  The fact that over 80,000 Jews were ultimately deported to death camps by French authorities during Marshal Petain's Vichy Government is depicted with a heart-wrenching simplicity as seen through the frightened and cowed eyes of the determined ten-year-old Sarah Starzinsky played with precocious perfection by M&eacute;lusine Mayance.  Discovering these more personal events triggered by the Vel D'Hiv roundup of 1942 from the vantage point of the present day is Julia Jarmond (Kristin Scott Thomas) who brings her unflappable perseverance to uncovering the details of a disturbing story to light despite the reluctance and ambivalence of others who feel the story might well be best forgotten.Is Julia just a hysterical woman flooded with pregnancy hormones and angst regarding her marriage that she simply must see the Sarah story to its endpoint?Writers Serge Joncour and Gilles Paquet-Brenner segue from the past to the present with ease, weaving the atrocities of the past within the arena of guilt and discomfort that defines home for their Julia.  Following the book closely, they report Sarah's story adequately, but fall short when the titular key unlocks the door in the wall and quite frankly, there is no where to go from that point on to balance the emotional drain.  Thankfully, this writing team decides not to pursue the romantic entanglement in which the novel's Julia eventually indulges.  The addition of the William character in De Rosnay's universe seems an attempt to add some yang to all the yin--the idea of having Julia bank her future happiness on Sarah's only son smacks of a contrivance that has no place in a story of such devastating emotional intensity.Let's face it, the only event that could have turned the tale around and brought out a bright smile and a few tears for theatregoers would have been a complete rewriting of the outcome.  Sarah rushes to the cabinet and unlocks the door--or, more practically, Jules and his wife take charge as adults would and move the poor girl out of harm's way so they could open what could well be the macabre sight of the boy's crypt.  As the door swings open, surprise--no one is there.  The emptiness suggests another mystery--where is the child?  Who took him? All of this could have flowed into the present story very nicely and provided the intrepid Julia with a flicker of hope, that she could fan into a huge magazine human-interest feature.Bottom line? Paquet-Brenner's adaptation of ""Sarah's Key"" by Tatiana De Rosnay follows the plot of the book faithfully for those who are devoted fans.  Young actress M&eacute;lusine Mayance and Kristin Scott Thomas as the two leads add solemnity and stellar acting to a story that because it hinges off a devastating negative event that is never balanced by one of equal positive power, it fails to emotionally satisfy.  Thankfully, Paquet-Brenner leaves out De Rosnay's contrived ending allowing the overall Holocaust awareness message first and foremost despite weighing against one of the main character's personal problems.

1428747,A2368W0H135KQP,B004UXUUDA,"D_shrink ""dshrink""","[1, 2]","This movie is really a story within a story. The real story is the tragedy accompanying the incidences in the life of young Sarah Starzynski, played by a fine young French actress Melusine Mayance.  But this plot is wrapped in the over-plot of an American journalist Julia Jarmond, played by the wonderful actress, Kristin Scott Thomas, who is assigned to cover the 1942 roundup of Jews in Paris ordered by the Vichy government which was in control at the time, but acting under German orders.  Julia's problem is that she finds out that the Paris apartment they inherited from her in-laws was the scene of a terrible tragedy involving the Jewish populace at the time, and particularly the young Sarah and her family who lived there before the Jarmonds took it over.  There is actually even a third minor plot of Julia finding out she has accidentally become pregnant and which causes great consternation between her, since she wants the baby, and her husband who doesn't.  To me this subplot added nothing to the story and was even a minor distraction, but I will leave that for you to decide.The story as told is basically sad, with only the opening scenes of Sarah and her younger brother, Michelle, or Michael playing together.  The real story begins when she hides Michael in a closet and locks it with a key to keep the police from taking him also.  The title gets its name from what happens with and because of that key, which is also the symbolism for why Sarah's life unfolds in the tragic manner in which it does.  Basically all the other characters play secondary or tertiary roles at best.  The movie is about the interconnectedness of Julia and Sarah, and how it changes the course of Julia's life once she begins her quest to find out what happened to Sarah.The acting by the two actresses previously mentioned was first-rate and the overall story line was captivating. Again, I think that the story of the late life pregnancy of Julia was unnecessary, whether it was part of the book or not, however, I recognize that some female viewers may think it adds to the integration of the story.  Also as others have commented, I think the ending was a bit saccharine and didn't quite ring true to life.  But all in all, this movie is fine viewing for adults with an interest in real drama.  Due to the main plot it is not appropriate for youngsters who may become frightened that such things that happened with Sarah and her brother might happen to them.",4,Emotionally Filled Tragedy,1322092800,"11 24, 2011",2011,2463,"['movie', 'really', 'story', 'story', 'real', 'story', 'tragedy', 'accompanying', 'incidences', 'life', 'young', 'Sarah', 'Starzynski', 'played', 'fine', 'young', 'French', 'actress', 'Melusine', 'Mayance', 'plot', 'wrapped', 'over-plot', 'American', 'journalist', 'Julia', 'Jarmond', 'played', 'wonderful', 'actress', 'Kristin', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'who', 'assigned', 'cover', '1942', 'roundup', 'Jews', 'Paris', 'ordered', 'Vichy', 'government', 'was', 'control', 'time', 'acting', 'German', 'orders', 'Julia', 'problem', 'out', 'Paris', 'apartment', 'inherited', 'in-laws', 'was', 'scene', 'terrible', 'tragedy', 'involving', 'Jewish', 'populace', 'time', 'particularly', 'young', 'Sarah', 'family', 'who', 'lived', 'Jarmonds', 'took', 'over', 'actually', 'even', 'third', 'minor', 'plot', 'Julia', 'finding', 'out', 'accidentally', 'become', 'pregnant', 'great', 'consternation', 'baby', 'husband', 'who', ""n't"", 'subplot', 'added', 'nothing', 'story', 'was', 'even', 'minor', 'distraction', 'will', 'leave', 'decide.The', 'story', 'told', 'basically', 'sad', 'only', 'opening', 'scenes', 'Sarah', 'younger', 'brother', 'Michelle', 'Michael', 'playing', 'together', 'real', 'story', 'when', 'Michael', 'closet', 'key', 'keep', 'police', 'taking', 'also', 'title', 'name', 'what', 'key', 'also', 'symbolism', 'why', 'Sarah', 'life', 'unfolds', 'tragic', 'manner', 'Basically', 'other', 'characters', 'play', 'secondary', 'tertiary', 'roles', 'best', 'movie', 'interconnectedness', 'Julia', 'Sarah', 'how', 'course', 'Julia', 'life', 'once', 'quest', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'Sarah.The', 'acting', 'two', 'actresses', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'was', 'first-rate', 'overall', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'captivating', 'Again', 'think', 'story', 'late', 'life', 'pregnancy', 'Julia', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'was', 'part', 'book', 'not', 'however', 'recognize', 'female', 'viewers', 'may', 'think', 'integration', 'story', 'Also', 'others', 'have', 'commented', 'think', 'ending', 'was', 'bit', 'saccharine', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'ring', 'true', 'life', 'movie', 'fine', 'viewing', 'adults', 'interest', 'real', 'drama', 'Due', 'main', 'plot', 'not', 'appropriate', 'youngsters', 'who', 'may', 'become', 'frightened', 'such', 'things', 'happened', 'Sarah', 'brother', 'might', 'happen']",N/A
1428748,A19LVB1C8L3LHW,B004UXUUDA,"Ed Brodow ""Author of Negotiation Boot Camp""","[4, 7]","There are two reasons why Sarah's Key is one of the best films I've seen in the last 20 years. First is the wonderful combination of direction/screenwriting. The director clearly understood his material and the screenplay is nothing short of brilliant. As we were leaving the theater, I said to my girlfriend, ""This is the best use of flashbacks I've ever seen."" I was alluding to the seamless interaction between the two plots, the World War II story and the contemporary one. By the end of the film, they are one story.The war story is that of a Jewish family sent to the camps by the French - not the Germans. A little girl locks her younger brother in the closet to save him from being deported with the rest of the family. (The ""Key"" is the key that opens the closet.) The result is a tragedy from which she never recovers. The modern tale of a couple whose lives become strangely connected to the deported Jewish family allows us to revisit the Holocaust from a fresh perspective. Personally, I found it compelling.What really fascinates me here is that the reviewer in the unimpeachable New York Times wrote this: ""Sarah's Key is undone by its very premise: that the two stories it tells can coexist in the same film."" Is it possible that this reviewer and I saw two different films? If I were the publisher of the Times and saw that review in my paper, I would waste little time in finding a new reviewer. (I am available.) For me, what the Times reviewer saw as the film's fatal flaw is its most admirable quality. As it shifts from one plot to the other and back again, Sarah's Key is nothing short of captivating. The bottom line is that I was never bored, not for a moment. At one point, I found myself not just crying but weeping uncontrollably. However, I did not come away from Sarah's Key in a mood of depression. Quite the contrary, the film communicated to me that no matter how horrific things get, the life force goes on. The message is ultimately uplifting.The other quality of Sarah's Key that impressed me was the acting, from the top down to the smallest role (the soldier who helps two prisoners escape). The child actor who plays Sarah is simply astounding. But it was Kristin Scott Thomas who really knocked my socks off. This is an actress whom I actively disliked in The English Patient and Four Weddings and a Funeral. After seeing this film, I confess that I must have blamed her for the flaws of the characters she played in those films instead of recognizing the quality of her craft.

She is married to a French magazine publisher and they have inherited an apartment in the Marais section of Paris from her husband's family. They are the parents of a teenage daughter and decide to renovate the apartment so that the three of them can live there in modernity and comfort. The apartment had belonged to her grandmother-in-law `s family since 1942.

The younger members of the magazine's editorial staff are unaware of this horrendous chapter in French history.

1428757,A328S9RN3U5M68,B004UXUUDA,Grady Harp,"[1, 2]","SARAH'S KEY (Elle s'appelait Sarah) is a brilliant film on many levels: the story itself, based on the best selling novel by Tatiana De Rosnay so beautifully adapted for the screen by Serge Joncour and Gilles Paquet-Brenner, directed with subtlety and verismo recreation of period by Gilles Paquet-Brenner assisted by cinematographer Pascal Ridao and scored by Max Richter, and the level of acting by not only some top notch actors by also by a cast of extras who seem so committed to the project that they feel very real.  The story is a tough one to tell - the surprise being the fact that France was complicit with the German occupiers in gathering the French Jews, sequestering them in hideous conditions and even sending them off to the extermination camps in Germany and Poland.  We have been lead to believe that the Nazis were the sole perpetrators of the Jewish Holocaust and to learn that other countries knowingly participated in the eradicating the 'Jewish problem' is startling and terribly sad to learn. But then we must remember our own management of 'foreigners' we sequestered in Relocation Camps across the United States during that time - the Japanese and the Germans - so we have our own cloud of Manzanar etc to ponder.The film opens in Paris in 1942  when French officials rounded up over 10,000 Jews and placed them in local camps. Eventually over 8,000 were sent off to German concentration camps. As 10-year old Sarah and her family are being arrested, she hides her younger brother in a closet. After realizing she will not be allowed to go home, Sarah does whatever she can to get back to her brother. The Strazynskis are placed in a filth transit facility in Paris awaiting the inevitable: the father is sent to concentration camp first followed by the separation of the mother and Sarah - the children are separated form their parents and sent to a special camp where in time Sarah and her young friend manage to escape so that Sarah can return to Paris to rescue her brother Michel.  Once in Paris Sarah must dress as a boy to disguise her from the German  investigators.  When she finally is able to return to her home she uses the key she has held in secret to open the door of the closet where she hid her brother and obviously finds him dead from starvation.  Sarah is cared for by Jules and Genevi&egrave;ve Dufaure (Niels Arestrup and Dominique Frot) until she is old enough to care for herself (the older Sarah is played with superb facility by M&eacute;lusine Mayance) and we lose sight of her.In 2009, a journalist named Julia (Kristin Scott Thomas) is on assignment to write a story on the deported Jews in 1942. When she moves into her father-in-law's childhood apartment, she realizes it once belonged to the Strazynski family, and their daughter Sarah.  Julia has private pains: she discovers that she is pregnant after being told she could never conceive and faces the fact that her husband Bertrand (Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Pierrot) does not want her to keep the pregnancy. Julia becomes obsessed with finding out what happened to Sarah and in doing so she slowly uncovers the difficult history of a girl so brave that she risked her life in the time of war only to become unable to retain her name, changing her life in such a way that she marries, has a son, and dies in a sad way.  Julia uncovers all of this as she feels that in past times her young daughter Zo&eacute; (Karina Hin) could have been Sarah.  Julia's life changes considerably and she returns to her home in New York where she discovers the final truths about Sarah and her key.One of the aspects of this film that makes it so meaningful is the fact the Kristin Scott Thomas can move so easily between French and English - a small fact, perhaps, as she is totally bilingual, but it helps the audience to understand her obsession to discover the truth about France's darkest hour.  The supporting cast is excellent and the recreation of WW II Paris is palpably real.  This is a brilliant film - one that deserves the attention of every one on so many levels.

This is a fictional story based on the real events during the round-up of Jews in France during the Nazi occupation of WW II.  In a way it covers a lot of the same ground as Schindler's List from a few years ago.  However, while Schindler's List told an actual story about the real people involved, Sarah's Key is a much more personal story about one fictional girl and what happened to her and her family.  Of course, it's an allegory about what was actually happening to real people at the time.  However, because it is such a personal story about one girl's experiences, it carries much more of an emotional impact than I got from watching Schindler's List.  That's what makes this movie such a great story - emotional resonance.  I think most of the other reviews here are also five stars - and that's what this should be.

I've not read the book nor knew of the true 1942 Vel'd'Hiv Jewish Roundup (a French police aided-Nazi Holocaust) in Paris. My 5-star rating indicates my perception of this fantastic story, done beautifully in contemporary sets as well as exquisite period scenes. The story comes alive, filled with suspense and dramatic action. ""Sarah's Key"" alternates rapidly from one era to the other, but the viewer is pulled into the emotion with a very realistic feel. A good portion of the dialogue is in French, especially the 1942 era sequences, but it does have English SUBTITLES.Is the movie about war, war's children, Jewish treatment, family suffering, survival...actually all of the above. Not light viewing, but compelling throughout.Kristin Scott Thomas is excellent in portraying Julia, the journalist who while researching an assignment discovers she's moving into her father-in-laws childhood home, and earlier being Sarah's family home. She is driven to unravel the mystery of Sarah. Sarah is played by a young French girl, Melusine Mayance, who shows the sophistication and savvy ability of a seasoned actress. This convincing film depicts a strong story. I took a chance, knowing little about this story, but both my wife and I am glad we watch.The bonus is a 63 minute Behind the Scenes.

She, age 10, her parents, and her brother, age 5, whom she loves dearly, live in a small apartment in France. The Nazis come to take them away and kill them because they are Jewish. Sarah decides to save her brother. She hides him in a closet within a paneled wall and locks it with a key. She tells her brother not to make a sound nor try to come out until she returns, and she promises the frightened boy that she will return. The Nazis make her return impossible. She and her parents are driven to a concentration camp and her parents are murdered there. Although a long time has passed, she is determined to return to her brother and keep her promise. She never lets go of the key, neither then nor for the rest of her life. She escapes from the concentration camp and is helped by non-Jewish husband and wife farmers.

This time the British actress is Julia Jarmond,  an American journalist,  living in Paris raising a teenager daughter with her French husband.She and her husband move into an apartment that has been owned by his family since 1942. Julia soon learns that the apartment has a very tragic history.In 1942, a lively Jewish population lived in the Marais area of Paris. Without warning the French authorities rounded up the Jewish population to be shipped to concentration camps. We step back in time to those fateful days in 1942. Lively10-year-old Sarah Starzynski played by the remarkable M&eacute;lusine Mayance lives with her parents and 4 year old brother in a flat in Marais. We soon learn the tragic meaning of ""Sarah's key"" and how lives were changed in an instant. Julia becomes obsessed with finding the fate of Sarah and the truth behind how the Jarmond family came to own the apartment.One can only imagine the millions of stories that were lived out and lost during WWII. Here is one fictionalized story that gets us to think, ""could it happen again?"" The French authorities willingly deported their Jewish population to certain death. The French citizens are shown taunting their former neighbors as the Jews are being herded away. I did appreciate a scene of humanity as French peasants threw apples over the fences to hungry children. It was a sign of decency and humanity by some good people who could do nothing more than offer some food to the doomed.Julia's life is changed forever and she is confronted with the past. Kristin Scott Thomas shines in her role as Julia. The tragedy of the meaning of Sarah's key is devastating to watch. The movie is a good study of people trying to survive in horrific times and trying to understand why some people were willing participants in the tragedy.The movie touches on a general theme that we have seen over and over again. The tragic past is being confronted. The significance of Sarah's key adds a twist to the story. I felt Sarah's struggle and story was enough for a while film without the present day story.

1428770,AQQFI7YHMRL7S,B004UXUUDA,James Morris,"[0, 0]","I have long had a fascination for Nazi atrocities and the Holocaust in particular.  I believe that the subject should not be forgotten and that the more one knows about the horrors that were inflicted upon the European population during World War II, the more one can educate those who have not learned enough about it, or have chosen to ignore it.  My DVD collection includes a large number of documentaries concerning the Holocaust, as well as many dramas that are based on historical facts surrounding the subject.  So, when Amazon Vine offered me a copy of Sarah's Key, I knew this film would fit right in.Sarah's key concerns a French journalist named Julia, who is assigned to do a story on the 1942 deportation of thousands of French Jews to Nazi concentration camps.  Coincidentally, she is in the process of moving with her husband into her father-in-law's childhood apartment, and she stumbles upon information that the home was previously occupied by the Jewish Straznski family, who were among those forcibly evicted and sent to the camps.  Fascinated by this information, she begins to uncover more details about the family whose life her future father-in-law and his family supplanted.The shameful deportation from Paris was handled by the French police, who sheepishly took orders from the Nazi killers to round up the Jews.  The most affecting and painful moments in the film are the horrible conditions endured by the deportees as they await transfer to the camps.  Held in a stadium without food, water, adequate plumbing or any comfortable way to sleep, the families endure their misery in ways that will thaw the heart and amaze the observer, especially those who are used to the most modern comforts and conveniences.  At the center of the story is a young girl named Sarah, who hides her little brother in a locked closet to escape the Nazis, thinking the family will be returning shortly.  Although their plight is clearly precarious and their danger extreme, all her thought are directed at the idea of returning home to free her brother from the closet.  When she does escape and tries to rescue him, the tragic results are some of the most heartbreaking moments in the film.There is an additional twist involving Julia's attempt to find the grown Sarah, and the effects on Sarah's offspring, but I would recommend anyone whose interest has been held thus far to see the film and discover these aspects for themselves.  While some of the drama involved is relegated to what has become standard Holocaust fare, there are enough personal touches and little known historic facts to make Sarah's key a worthy entry in the crowded canon of Holocaust dramas.

She stumbles upon a family secret which will link her forever to the destiny of a young Jewish girl, Sarah.

She resolves to find out what happened to the former occupants: Wladyslaw and Rywka Starzynski, parents of 10-year-old Sarah and four-year-old Michel. The more Julia discovers - especially about Sarah, the only member of the Starzynski family to survive - the more she uncovers about Bertrand's family, about France and, finally, herself.""This is a French film that stars the acclaimed actress Kristin Scott Thomas as the journalist, a wonderful and versatile M&eacute;lusine Mayance as the young Sarah, Niels Arestrup as the farmer who hides Sarah from the Germans, Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Pierrot as Jarmond's husband, and American actor Aiden Quinn in a small but stellar role in the last third of the film.  Although it is a Holocaust movie, there are very few graphic scenes and several glimpses of happier days: young Sarah playing on the bed with her brother in the Marais apartment; Sarah and another girl ripping the Star of David from their clothing, frolicking in a field of wheat, and bathing in a muddy river after their escape from a detainee camp; the two young girls sleeping in a farmer's barn with his guard dog.The true star (or villain) of the film is the Velodrome d'Hiver, an indoor bicyle track and sports stadium which was located in Paris near the Eiffel Tower. Built for the World's Fair in 1900, the small track was enlarged and moved several blocks farther away from the Tower to house events for the 1924 Summer Olympics. Damaged by fire in 1959 and demolished, the glass-topped structure was reconstructed for the movie by its crew. A bonus feature of the DVD shows the amazing reconstruction.Of the 28,000 Jews deported from Paris and Northern France by French police at the request of German occupiers, 13,152 men, women and children were placed in the Vel d'Hiv in July of 1942 for eight days. No toilet access and little food or water was available...and the comparison to the New Orleans Superdome catastrophe is drawn early in the film. (The film's modern-day action is updated to 2009 to allow this comparison.)This DVD is the film with English subtitles that had a limited USA release in July of 2011 to be touted as an Oscar 2012 contender. I had hesistated to rent a DVD with subtitles...but about a third of the film (the modern-day events) is in English...and the transition is smooth and not disruptive. From other Amazon reviews, it appears that the film closely follows the novel. Tatiana de Rosnay collaborated with Director Paquel-Brenner who wrote the screenplay.SARAH'S KEY is one of the best films I saw in 2011.Highly recommended.Jane",5,The  star of this film:  the once famous Paris Velodrome d'Hiver ....,1325376000,"01 1, 2012",2012,3254,"['SARAH', 'KEY', 'novel', 'Tatiana', 'Rosnay', 'film', 'Paquel-BrennerThe', 'best', 'plot', 'summary', 'film', 'are', 'words', 'taken', 'starred', 'review', 'Publishers', 'Weekly', 'novel', 'appearing', 'Metacritic', 'internet', 'site', 'Julia', 'Jarmond', 'American', 'journalist', 'married', 'Frenchman', 'commissioned', 'write', 'article', 'notorious', 'Vel', ""d'Hiv"", 'round', 'up', 'took', 'place', 'Paris', '1942', 'family', 'secret', 'will', 'link', 'forever', 'destiny', 'young', 'Jewish', 'girl', 'Sarah', 'Julia', 'apartment', 'husband', 'Bertrand', 'plan', 'move', 'was', 'acquired', 'Bertrand', 'family', 'when', 'Jewish', 'occupants', 'were', 'dispossessed', 'deported', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'former', 'occupants', 'Wladyslaw', 'Rywka', 'Starzynski', 'parents', '10-year-old', 'Sarah', 'four-year-old', 'Michel', 'more', 'Julia', 'discovers', 'especially', 'Sarah', 'only', 'member', 'Starzynski', 'family', 'survive', 'more', 'Bertrand', 'family', 'France', 'finally', 'French', 'film', 'acclaimed', 'actress', 'Kristin', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'journalist', 'wonderful', 'versatile', 'M', 'eacute', 'lusine', 'Mayance', 'young', 'Sarah', 'Niels', 'Arestrup', 'farmer', 'who', 'Sarah', 'Germans', 'Fr', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'ric', 'Pierrot', 'Jarmond', 'husband', 'American', 'actor', 'Aiden', 'Quinn', 'small', 'stellar', 'role', 'last', 'third', 'film', 'Holocaust', 'movie', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'graphic', 'scenes', 'several', 'glimpses', 'happier', 'days', 'young', 'Sarah', 'playing', 'bed', 'brother', 'Marais', 'apartment', 'Sarah', 'girl', 'ripping', 'Star', 'David', 'clothing', 'frolicking', 'field', 'wheat', 'bathing', 'muddy', 'river', 'escape', 'detainee', 'camp', 'two', 'young', 'girls', 'sleeping', 'farmer', 'barn', 'guard', 'dog.The', 'true', 'star', 'villain', 'film', 'Velodrome', ""d'Hiver"", 'indoor', 'bicyle', 'track', 'sports', 'stadium', 'was', 'located', 'Paris', 'Eiffel', 'Tower', 'Built', 'World', 'Fair', '1900', 'small', 'track', 'was', 'enlarged', 'moved', 'several', 'blocks', 'farther', 'away', 'Tower', 'house', 'events', '1924', 'Summer', 'Olympics', 'Damaged', 'fire', '1959', 'demolished', 'glass-topped', 'structure', 'was', 'reconstructed', 'movie', 'crew', 'bonus', 'feature', 'DVD', 'amazing', 'reconstruction.Of', '28,000', 'Jews', 'deported', 'Paris', 'Northern', 'France', 'French', 'police', 'request', 'German', 'occupiers', '13,152', 'men', 'women', 'children', 'were', 'placed', 'Vel', ""d'Hiv"", 'July', '1942', 'eight', 'days', 'toilet', 'access', 'little', 'food', 'water', 'was', 'available', 'comparison', 'New', 'Orleans', 'Superdome', 'catastrophe', 'drawn', 'early', 'film', 'film', 'modern-day', 'action', 'updated', '2009', 'allow', 'comparison', 'DVD', 'film', 'English', 'subtitles', 'had', 'limited', 'USA', 'release', 'July', '2011', 'be', 'touted', 'Oscar', '2012', 'contender', 'had', 'hesistated', 'rent', 'DVD', 'subtitles', 'third', 'film', 'modern-day', 'events', 'English', 'transition', 'smooth', 'not', 'disruptive', 'other', 'Amazon', 'reviews', 'film', 'closely', 'novel', 'Tatiana', 'Rosnay', 'collaborated', 'Director', 'Paquel-Brenner', 'who', 'wrote', 'screenplay.SARAH', 'KEY', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'saw', '2011.Highly', 'recommended.Jane']",N/A

""Sarah's Key,"" about the notorious (and too-little known) Vel D'Hiv roundup of French Jews in 1946, fit the bill perfectly. The story centers around Sarah Starzynski, whose family is removed from their Paris apartment during the roundup. Sarah hides her young brother from the French police, and for the rest of the film, she attempts to reunite with him. But the film has a modern aspects as well. Journalist Julia Jarmond (Kristin Scott Thomas) has married into the family that owns the apartment vacated by the Starzynskis. Following a series of clues and her own research, she attempts to find what happened to Sarah and her family.The film has several facets that raise it up from a standard Holocaust film. One, the film focuses on the willingness of the occupied French government to go along with Nazi aims. Second, I appreciated the bilingual script - French characters did not have to speak English, helping to retain historical accuracy. And finally the complexities of connecting families -- after 60 years of intervening history - was believably fragmented and uncertain. But the biggest factor in the film's favor was the casting of M&eacute;lusine Mayance as Sarah. M&eacute;lusine's emotive eyes, her childish courage and desperate love for her family make her the most heartbreaking young heroine since Fantine in ""Les Miserables.""""Sarah's Key"" is so touchingly real that I wanted to know more about real-life fates of the film's characters.

To get this movie; have your family identity destroyed or threatened or to know someone who did.  Spend countless hours with those who have been through spiritual/emotional holocausts, and this story has many elements of truth in common with theirs.  Children robbed of innocence, trying to hide a past, trying to be something else because your identity may cost you everything, possibly your own children.  People you trusted turned on you.  People you didn't know came to your rescue.  Strangers raised you and hid your identity within theirs.  People you thought were your enemy, broke the rules that you might escape.  You end up doing the very thing that goes contrary to all humanity ""think only of yourself.""  Your parents don't even trust you and attack your actions.

1428782,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B004UXUUDA,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[20, 21]","Part of the dangers inherent in adapting a wildly popular and beloved novel is that if you miss the mark, even in the slightest, you risk antagonizing a core audience that will be brutal in its appraisal.  ""Sarah's Key"" is such a story.  This adaptation of Tatiana De Rosnay's memorable bestseller, however, strikes the right balance which should appease both fans of the novel and new viewers alike.  This is an impeccably mounted production that straddles contemporary drama with mysteries from the past.  As the first half of the picture unfolded, I truly felt as if I were seeing one of the most effective and affecting films of the year.  It is that good.  Once a pivotal moment is reached in the story, however, the narrative momentum takes a sharp turn and the movie loses some of its dramatic imperative.  Don't get me wrong, it's still a solid feature--but the first hour is so good, the second half pales a bit in comparison.The plot drives you forward with the fascinating and harrowing story of a young girl named Sarah set amidst the round-up of Jews in 1942 France.  Sarah's tale is intercut with modern sequences in which Kristin Scott Thomas plays a journalist about to inhabit an apartment once occupied by Sarah's family. Scott Thomas becomes intrigued by the history of the residence as her husband's family acquired the property late in 1942.  This leads her to be obsessed in finding out the truth of the those that were forced to give up the apartment.  While Scott Thomas is terrific, it is Sarah's tale that really resonates.  Sent to the camps, divided from her family, desperate to find her brother--I was captivated, horrified, and excited by her journey.  She is a great character leading the viewer on a devastating path.  A moment halfway through the story stands as one of the highpoints in film this year.  But after that moment, Sarah all but disappears from the film.  Instead of being a pivotal lead, she becomes more of an enigma.  And the focus shifts firmly to Scott Thomas tracking down the girl.  This mystery element is fine, and has its moments, but nothing compares to Sarah's own voice.The difference between the first half of the film and the second is like night and day.  One is a story lived, one is a story told.  It is a dichotomy that is also showcased in the novel, but I didn't feel the void left by Sarah's absence so astutely on the page.  Melusine Mayance is unforgettable as the young Sarah, and Scott Thomas is at the top of her game.  Whether or not you've read the novel, this is an easy recommendation.  It is top tier filmmaking for adult audiences.  The first hour of ""Sarah's Key"" is burned into my brain!

The first is that it examines the willing culpability of a group separate from the Nazis - in this case, the French government.  The suffering the French government inflicted upon its own citizens - all in the name of ethnic cleansing - is shocking, heartbreaking and all too-familiarly horrifying in its execution.  Sadly the French were far from alone in such actions.However, the most important point that this film illustrates is the post-traumatic aftermath of such human suffering. Despite the loving support of her adopted French family and the subsequent love of a caring, doting husband and precious son, Sarah could not overcome or come to terms with the pain and loss she endured during the Holocaust.  Like with the brilliant and prolific, Primo Levi, the horror of those experiences was simply too much to bear.The film is wonderful in the telling of the story and its current-day impact on those who previously felt they had no connection with those events of 60+ years ago.  But, ultimately, it's Sarah's story: of loss, of attempted rebuilding and ultimate self-sacrifice in the face of such overwhelming trauma.

If you had never seen ""Schindler's List"" or read Anne Frank's ""The Diary of a Young Girl"" or been exposed to stories where ""the events of the past are uncovered by someone in the present, affecting that person in the future"" you might think Sarah's Key extraordinarily packed with pathos and humanity, along with a withering indictment against the Holocaust.  The always-wonderful Kristin Scott Thomas is featured as a modern day reporter who researches a story about Jews who were rounded up in Paris in the early part of the Nazi's control and extinction.  As good as Scott-Thomas is, her ""story"" is a small and comparatively unimportant one compared to the portions set 70 years ago.  Meryl Streep's recent ""The Iron Lady"" was all but ruined (in my opinion, as Streep won the Academy Award) by the flashback sequences between the later years Margaret Thatcher - who was senile and feeble - and the earlier, robust Dame Thatcher who rose from plain beginnings to be prime minister.)  So it is in ""Sarah's Key"" - sticking to the Holocaust story would have made a stronger, shorter, movie.  It is important, as Holocaust ""deniers"" unintentionally remind us, that we NOT forget the atrocities of history lest they be repeated - and to honor the victims.  There have even been superb post-Schindler's movies - from ""The Pianist"" to ""Inglourious Basterds"".

The story moves comfortably back and forth between the past and present as it unfolds telling a dramatic and tragic story.Sarah Starzynski was a young French Jew during WWII. As the Jews in Paris are being rounded up, she tells her brother to hide in the secret closet and not to let anyone know he is there, locking the door behind her. What she doesn't realize is that this is not a few hours away trip but a transport of Jews to the camps. Unable to leave to release her brother, she searches for a way out.Relocated to a velodrome with no bathrooms and horror inducing conditions, the family is finally taken to trains and unable to rescue their son. But Sarah never gives up hope, holding tightly to the key in her possession.Each step of her trip is followed by Julia in the present as she searches for answers of what happened to the young girl. It becomes even more personal when she finds that the new building she and her husband are renovating is one that's been owned by the family since as far back as the war. Could they have known what became of the boy? Or of Sarah? Julia continues to search for answers, feeling a connection by being in the same apartment.The story follows Sarah as she and her family are separated in the camps. Few people realize that the Germans were not the only ones to have taken unkindly to the Jews during the war. In an attempt to placate the Germans, many French involved themselves in these roundups as well. It is only in recent years their involvement has been made more public.In the camp Sarah continues to hold on to hope (and her key) that her brother is still out there and safe. If only she could reach him. With nothing to lose, she plans an escape and a way back to Paris. This would be an incredible task for anyone but even more so for Sarah who is only around 10 years old.Julia continues to learn more about the apartment and about Sarah. And the more she learns the more she yearns to know what happened. Things between her and her husband become strained. She questions his family about what they knew. And by the end of the film we too will learn what became of Sarah and her brother.While the movie is about a horrifying experience and piece of history, it never plays it for the cheap thrill. The suicide of one woman in the velodrome is the worst it gets, but you know what's going to happen to these people. The interweaving of the two stories is well handled and the acting makes you feel that these people are truly going through the ordeals they find themselves in past and present.SARAH'S KEY is a timely story, especially when one witnesses the anti-Semitic remarks hurled during the latest Occupy Wall Street protests. It is a lesson we should have learned by now but apparently haven't. And perhaps that makes this movie one that should be seen today.

She is currently researching a story about the French Government's role in rounding up Jews during World War II and sending them to Nazi death camps.  In talking to one of her in-laws, Kristin learns that a relocated Jewish family once occupied the apartment in which her father-in-law was raised, and which she and her family are now about to move into.  Disturbed by this information, Kristin is determined to discover what happened to that family.Kristin's story cuts back-and-forth with the saga of Sarah (Melusine Mayance), the young French Jewish girl who, back in 1942 when the French police came, locked her younger brother in a closet so that he would not be taken away.  This part of the heart-wrenching narrative follows her heroic efforts to escape the death journey to Poland, return to Paris and free her brother.As moving and as well done as this film may be, like all Holocaust movies, SARAH'S KEY is not always easy to watch.  The performances are superb, as are the storytelling abilities of Gilles Paquet-Brenner, who directed this adaptation of Tatiana de Rosnay's bestselling novel.The supporting cast of the movie, presented in both English and French (with English subtitles), includes Niels Arestrup, Frederic Pierrot and Aidan Quinn.The DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment includes a ""Making of"" featurette.

Moore,"[2, 2]","Not far into Gilles Paquet-Brenner's ""Sarah's Key,"" Julia Jarmond (Kristin Scott-Thomas) shows her journalist colleagues a wall filled with pictures of French-Jewish children who were victims of the Holocaust. She tells them she wants to find the names and stories of those children, to show the world they were not just statistics. Soon enough, Julia uncovers the story of one child, Sarah Starzynski (Melusine Mayance), whose tragic life turns out to have uncomfortably close ties to Julia's own.Spanning two continents and more than 60 years of history, ""Sarah's Key"" is a moving story of the Holocaust and the repercussions it has for those who live today. By telling us the story of one abused girl, who is forced in the end to carry a burden of guilt beyond anyone's imagining, ""Sarah's Key"" demands that we face ourselves. Faced with innocent neighbors being hauled off to certain death, Julia asks, what would we have done? Would we have risked our own lives to protect them, or would we--like millions of Frenchmen--have stayed silent, or even taken an active role in the slaughter?""Sarah's Key"" is as graceful and lyrical as any film about the Holocaust possibly can be. The acting is first-rate throughout, with a particularly moving, assured performance by young Mayance. Be sure to watch the ""Making-Of"" documentary in the Bonus section, which contains some sobering parts: the testimony of several extras who are actual Holocaust survivors, and of the actor who plays Sarah's father, who speaks of the tortures suffered by him and his family as ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.",4,The story of one girl...,1324166400,"12 18, 2011",2011,1586,"['Not', 'far', 'Gilles', 'Paquet-Brenner', 'Sarah', 'Key', 'Julia', 'Jarmond', 'Kristin', 'Scott-Thomas', 'journalist', 'colleagues', 'wall', 'filled', 'pictures', 'French-Jewish', 'children', 'who', 'were', 'victims', 'Holocaust', 'find', 'names', 'stories', 'children', 'show', 'world', 'were', 'not', 'just', 'statistics', 'Soon', 'enough', 'Julia', 'story', 'one', 'child', 'Sarah', 'Starzynski', 'Melusine', 'Mayance', 'tragic', 'life', 'out', 'have', 'uncomfortably', 'close', 'ties', 'Julia', 'own.Spanning', 'two', 'continents', 'more', '60', 'years', 'history', 'Sarah', 'Key', 'moving', 'story', 'Holocaust', 'repercussions', 'who', 'live', 'today', 'telling', 'story', 'one', 'abused', 'girl', 'who', 'forced', 'end', 'carry', 'burden', 'guilt', 'anyone', 'imagining', 'Sarah', 'Key', 'face', 'Faced', 'innocent', 'neighbors', 'being', 'hauled', 'off', 'certain', 'death', 'Julia', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'Would', 'have', 'risked', 'own', 'lives', 'protect', 'would', 'millions', 'Frenchmen', 'have', 'stayed', 'silent', 'even', 'taken', 'active', 'role', 'slaughter', 'Sarah', 'Key', 'as', 'graceful', 'lyrical', 'film', 'Holocaust', 'possibly', 'can', 'be', 'acting', 'first-rate', 'particularly', 'moving', 'assured', 'performance', 'young', 'Mayance', 'Be', 'sure', 'watch', 'Making-Of', 'documentary', 'Bonus', 'section', 'sobering', 'parts', 'testimony', 'several', 'extras', 'who', 'are', 'actual', 'Holocaust', 'survivors', 'actor', 'who', 'Sarah', 'father', 'who', 'tortures', 'suffered', 'family', 'ethnic', 'Albanians', 'Kosovo']",N/A

Oleson,"[0, 0]","This overlooked gem of a film begins with American journalist Julia Jarmond (the always impeccable Kristin Scott Thomas) searching for information about French Jews captured during WW II.  She is married to a career focused Frenchman.  They are about to move into a new apartment in Paris.  She learns that there is a history with the apartment which was given to the couple by Julia's father-in-law.Through internet information, visits to encampment sites and personal interviews she begins to uncover secrets of what was known as the Vel d'Hiv round-up.  This was not a Nazi orchestrated maneuver but one instituted by the French.  Many Frenchmen believed that imprisoning Jews would save their own hides.  The French would like to ignore this terrible event.  Julia begins to focus on one 10 year old girl named Sarah.  In a haunting performance by Melusine Mayance, Sarah is the lone survivor of her family that was rousted from the apartment 60 years earlier. The apartment that Julia will soon occupy.The film flashes back and forth between the current day investigation and 1942 when the horrible incident occurred.  Sarah carries with her a tremendous burden involving her 4 year old brother as the film moves into the 1960's.  The final act does moves away from the mystery and horror as Julia locates descendents of Sarah and her family.  A bit melodramatic toward the end?  Sure, but it felt somewhat earned as release from the pit-in-stomach feeling that had been built up.  A very good movie.Scott Thomas not only performs the film with her accomplished French but a damn good American accent as well.  The movie is in French and English with subtitles.  The Blu ray disc has a beautiful 1080p transfer and captures the original aspect ratio of 2.35:1.  There is very little guessing as to which time period you're seeing as the look is much different.  The more somber greyish and browns play during the 1942 period.  The current period involves more color and brightness.  The Blu ray is excellent in highlighting the differences.

I hadn't heard of this film at all before it arrived at my house so I was worried that it might just be one of those movies that really isn't all that different from a Lifetime original movie. But Kristen Scott Thomas gives a believable performance that comes across as genuine rather than melodramatic. I was actually sad to see her role diminish as the movie progressed.I have the film four stars rather than five because I thought that the flashback scenes could've been integrated into the movie in a more professional fashion than they were. I understand that the movie was trying to follow the book, but it felt weird that the movie spent so much time at once on the flashback moments. Kristen Scott Thomas is supposed to be the lead and her relationship with the reader is challenged once she basically disappears as the flashbacks begin.I enjoyed Sarah's Key, but I don't know if it has a lot of mainstream appeal.

I am not sure if ""Sarah's Key"" was her first book to be made into a movie.  I have decided to see the movie before I read the book.  Main reason being that one of the characters in the film is played by the British actress Kristen Scott Thomas.  Kristen Scott Thomas is one of those rare bi-lingual actresses whos is fluent in French.  She always plays powerful women who do not compromise on their choices in life.  This character was no different.  She plays a journalist who is on the quest to write a lenghty story about a part of French history most French would like to forget.  It is about the mass sendoff of French (Parisian) Jews to the concentration camps during 1942.Film covers events from the WWII and events in the present.

She is always so cool (as in not warm).  Her steely pursuit of the truth about Sarah provides vivid contrast to the searing wartime scenes.  KST somewhat reprises her role from the first part of The Horse Whisperer - the reserved, focused journalist who cannot see beyond her own search and cannot imagine the search might cause harm to someone else.

With the movie out, and now available on DVD, and the book, Sarah's Key, at this writing in its 142nd week on the New York Times paperback best seller list (currently at #5), this Holocaust story is finally getting the attention it deserves.This is the story of Sarah--who, at the age of 10, is yanked from her home, dumped with thousands of others into a huge indoor arena in the heart of Paris to endure without food, water, sleep or sanitation for six days, then separated from her family and shipped to a French-run internment camp to await the next train to Auschwitz. Scenes of Sarah's plight and how she survives it alternate with the present-day narrative of Julia, an American magazine writer (Kristin Scott Thomas) living in Paris who's assigned to write about this black mark in French history as its 60th anniversary approaches. Eventually, Sarah's and Julia's two stories will intersect.So...which is better, the book or the movie? Something of a toss-up, I'd say.  The book, because you'll spend much more time with it, takes you deeper into the story and extends your involvement.  The movie's  superb acting and cinematography enhance that involvement.  What the DVD adds is the most detailed ""making-of"" feature I've ever seen--it runs nearly as long as the movie itself--and merits a look, even--or especially-for those who've already read the book or seen it in a theater.Book/movie pluses and minuses: There's a point in both versions where we lose track of what happened to Sarah and the focus turns to Julia's marital woes; in both versions I found that detour soap-opera-ish,  over-long and off-putting, but somewhat less so in the movie, probably because of Scott-Thomas's excellent acting.  Also, I found the movie's ending more gripping than the one in the book, but after I thought about it for awhile I realized that some of the chronology in the otherwise compelling story Sarah's son tells Julia in the film just doesn't add up; two things that account for the lack of a fifth star on this review.",4,A very good book that became a very good movie that gained something extra on DVD,1322438400,"11 28, 2011",2011,2259,"['Tatiana', 'de', 'Rosnay', 'novel', 'Sarah', 'Key', 'came', 'out', '2008', 'few', 'people', 'now', 'alive', 'were', 'aware', 'story', 'Vel', ""d'Hiv"", 'hideously', 'cruel', 'massive', 'roundup', 'ten', 'thousand', 'Parisian', 'Jews', 'French', 'police', 'July', '16', '1942', 'movie', 'now', 'available', 'DVD', 'book', 'Sarah', 'Key', 'writing', '142nd', 'week', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'paperback', 'best', 'seller', 'list', 'currently', '5', 'Holocaust', 'story', 'finally', 'getting', 'attention', 'story', 'Sarah', 'who', 'age', '10', 'yanked', 'home', 'dumped', 'thousands', 'others', 'huge', 'indoor', 'arena', 'heart', 'Paris', 'endure', 'food', 'water', 'sleep', 'sanitation', 'six', 'days', 'then', 'separated', 'family', 'shipped', 'French-run', 'internment', 'camp', 'await', 'next', 'train', 'Auschwitz', 'Scenes', 'Sarah', 'plight', 'how', 'alternate', 'present-day', 'narrative', 'Julia', 'American', 'magazine', 'writer', 'Kristin', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'living', 'Paris', 'who', 'assigned', 'write', 'black', 'mark', 'French', 'history', '60th', 'anniversary', 'approaches', 'Eventually', 'Sarah', 'Julia', 'two', 'stories', 'will', 'intersect.So', 'better', 'book', 'movie', 'Something', 'toss-up', ""'d"", 'say', 'book', ""'ll"", 'spend', 'much', 'more', 'time', 'deeper', 'story', 'involvement', 'movie', 'superb', 'acting', 'cinematography', 'enhance', 'involvement', 'What', 'DVD', 'most', 'detailed', 'making-of', 'feature', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'nearly', 'as', 'long', 'movie', 'look', 'even', 'especially-for', 'who', ""'ve"", 'already', 'read', 'book', 'seen', 'theater.Book/movie', 'pluses', 'minuses', 'point', 'versions', 'where', 'lose', 'track', 'what', 'happened', 'Sarah', 'focus', 'Julia', 'marital', 'woes', 'versions', 'found', 'detour', 'soap-opera-ish', 'over-long', 'off-putting', 'somewhat', 'less', 'so', 'movie', 'probably', 'Scott-Thomas', 'excellent', 'acting', 'Also', 'found', 'movie', 'ending', 'more', 'gripping', 'one', 'book', 'thought', 'awhile', 'realized', 'chronology', 'otherwise', 'compelling', 'story', 'Sarah', 'son', 'Julia', 'film', 'just', ""n't"", 'add', 'up', 'two', 'things', 'account', 'lack', 'fifth', 'star', 'review']",N/A

But things don't quite work out as she hoped; she keeps the key through their hideous time at the Velodrome and manages to hang on to it after the Jews are transported to camps outside of Paris. Her singular goal is to escape and go back to the apartment to make sure Michel escaped the closet.At the same time we are presented with the contemporary storyline of Julia Dormond, an American journalist living in Paris and married to a Frenchman. She decides to do a story on the Vel d'Hiv roundup, a heinous event that France for decades refused to mention or apologize for. (Just FYI, though the story is fiction, the roundup did happen) In her quest to find out the fate of the victims, she is led not only to little Sarah Starzynski's photo but inevitably to her husband's own family and the apartment in which they now live.It's really hard for me to say more without doling out spoilers, but this film is, in my opinion, almost perfectly made. The actress who plays Sarah, Melusine Mayance, is fabulous; she tackles the complete range of emotions required of her with brilliance. As Julia, Kristin Scott Thomas is a wonderful fit for a character who has to be both tough and conflicted (and speak perfect French and English). The cinematography in the scenes from 1942 is breathtaking at times; I think the director did an amazing job pacing and crafting scenes to have the utmost emotional impact.In a perfect world, this movie would be nominated for an Oscar and young Melusine as well. It is a French film and probably about two-thirds in French - so perhaps a nomination in the foreign film category?

One takes place in the past, and the other in the present.Story 1: A journalist begins to research a holocost related event that took place in Paris called V&eacute;l d'Hiver Roundup. As she researches, she learns that her in-laws apartment she and her husband have just inherited originally belonged to a Jewish family that was taken in the Roundup. She finds she's pregnant. She wants the baby and her husband wants her to abort it.Story 2: Sarah, a young girl locks her brother in a hidden closet to protect him from being taken in Roundup. She doesn't realize that she won't be back. We watch her as she realizes he will die, so tries to get back to him to save him.The movie kept me interested. Though the the journalist's story dragged a bit at times, Sarah's story was always captivating.The movie brings an historical event into the light that should not be forgotten. I had never even heard of the V&eacute;l d'Hiver Roundup. In July 1942 the French police willingly participated in rounding up and deporting over thirteen thousand jewish men, women and children to Auschwitz extermination camp. The movie follows Sarah's family as they were taken, and then held for days in a sports arena with thousands of others without toilets, water or food.Of note is that although there was some violence, it was not very graphic. Also a woman commits suicide by jumping to her death.The only reason I didn't give 5 stars for this movie was that it didn't pack the emotional punch of other holocost related movies such as The Piano and Schindler's list.

Murray""","[0, 1]","""Elle s'appelait Sarah"" (Sarah's Key, 2010, based on Tatiana de Rosnay's 2007  international best-seller, directed and cowritten by Gilles Paquet-Brenner) has two stories. The present-day one involves an American-born  reporter (Julia, played by the and comfortably bilingual Kristin Scott Thomas), with a great deal of latitude at work whose marriage to a French wheeler-dealer played by (Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Pierrot, who also costarred with Thomas in French in ""I've Loved You So Long"") is fragile. She is unexpectedly (miraculously) pregnant and he really does not want to start parenting again at the beginning, and her choice is pretty much between having the baby or having the husband.The couple and their teenage daughter are about to take over an apartment in Paris' Marais district that her husband and his father grew up in. When Julia learns that her in-laws moved into the apartment in August of 1942, she suspects that it was vacant because 13,152 Jews had been rounded up by the FRENCH police and sent off to the gas chambers at Auschwitz after very inhumane concentration in the racetrak, the Rafle du V&eacute;lodrome d'Hiver.The movie shows more of the tragic story of the Starzynski who had lived in the apartment than Julia could possibly learn, despite her pursuing the story into the French countryside, to Brooklyn, and to Florence.The focus on FRENCH active engagement in Nazi genocide was also the focus of ""Mr. Klein"" and ""A Secret,"" though I have no objection to reminding the French of official and mass collaboration with the Nazis, in genocide as in other matters. But, good as Thomas is (which is very good indeed), her soap opera melodrama pales before the tragedy of the Starzynskis, by which I mean something more than the general tragedy of genocide.Pascal Ridao's cinematography is impressive differentiating times and places and there is a compelling performance from M&eacute;lusine Mayance as Sarah Starzynski, a girl in 1942 who tried to save her younger brother from the roundup. The male characters are mostly passive and not very interesting (with the exception of Niels Arestrup and Michel Duchaussoy as crusty older men, so maybe I mean the middle-aged male characters).",4,Deja vu in another particular family's holocaust tragedy,1322006400,"11 23, 2011",2011,2218,"['Elle', ""s'appelait"", 'Sarah', 'Sarah', 'Key', '2010', 'based', 'Tatiana', 'de', 'Rosnay', '2007', 'international', 'best-seller', 'directed', 'cowritten', 'Gilles', 'Paquet-Brenner', 'two', 'stories', 'present-day', 'one', 'American-born', 'reporter', 'Julia', 'played', 'comfortably', 'bilingual', 'Kristin', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'great', 'deal', 'latitude', 'work', 'marriage', 'French', 'wheeler-dealer', 'played', 'Fr', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'ric', 'Pierrot', 'who', 'also', 'costarred', 'Thomas', 'French', ""'ve"", 'Loved', 'So', 'Long', 'fragile', 'unexpectedly', 'miraculously', 'pregnant', 'really', 'not', 'want', 'start', 'parenting', 'again', 'beginning', 'choice', 'pretty', 'much', 'having', 'baby', 'having', 'husband.The', 'couple', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'are', 'take', 'over', 'apartment', 'Paris', 'Marais', 'district', 'husband', 'father', 'grew', 'up', 'When', 'Julia', 'in-laws', 'moved', 'apartment', 'August', '1942', 'was', 'vacant', '13,152', 'Jews', 'had', 'been', 'rounded', 'up', 'FRENCH', 'police', 'sent', 'off', 'gas', 'chambers', 'Auschwitz', 'very', 'inhumane', 'concentration', 'racetrak', 'Rafle', 'du', 'V', 'eacute', ""d'Hiver.The"", 'movie', 'more', 'tragic', 'story', 'Starzynski', 'who', 'had', 'lived', 'apartment', 'Julia', 'could', 'possibly', 'learn', 'pursuing', 'story', 'French', 'countryside', 'Brooklyn', 'Florence.The', 'focus', 'FRENCH', 'active', 'engagement', 'Nazi', 'genocide', 'was', 'also', 'focus', 'Mr.', 'Klein', 'A', 'Secret', 'have', 'objection', 'reminding', 'French', 'official', 'mass', 'collaboration', 'Nazis', 'genocide', 'other', 'matters', 'good', 'Thomas', 'very', 'good', 'indeed', 'soap', 'opera', 'melodrama', 'pales', 'tragedy', 'Starzynskis', 'mean', 'something', 'more', 'general', 'tragedy', 'genocide.Pascal', 'Ridao', 'cinematography', 'impressive', 'differentiating', 'times', 'places', 'compelling', 'performance', 'M', 'eacute', 'lusine', 'Mayance', 'Sarah', 'Starzynski', 'girl', '1942', 'who', 'tried', 'save', 'younger', 'brother', 'roundup', 'male', 'characters', 'are', 'mostly', 'passive', 'not', 'very', 'interesting', 'exception', 'Niels', 'Arestrup', 'Michel', 'Duchaussoy', 'crusty', 'older', 'men', 'maybe', 'mean', 'middle-aged', 'male', 'characters']",N/A

Her family is moving into an apartment that has been in her husband's family for many years.  She gets an assignment to research and write a feature article about an atrocity that occurred in France during the second World War -- an infamous 1942 roundup and deportaion of 8,000 Jews to French-controlled concentration camps, with Auschwitz the final destination for many.Julia discovers that her family's apartment was once home to a Jewish family evicted and deported during that time.  She does some investigating and learns of Sarah (Melusine Mayance), a 10-year-old girl who attempted to hide her little brother from the French police.The film shuttles back and forth from the present to the World War II era as Sarah's story unfolds, illustrating how the war has affected people from the 40's to the present.  The movie asks questions raised many times before, but gives the story a very personal slant by focusing on one family targeted by the social-political horror of Nazi rule.  If there is a flaw in the film, it is that a subplot regarding Julia's relationship with her husband seems out of balance with the more important tale of man's indifference toward fellow human beings.The movie unfolds like a mystery as we, the audience, discover information as Julia uncovers it, much of it surprising and unsettling, some horrifying.

They were mostly women and children and were herded into the city's velodrome, where they were kept in stifling temperatures with no amenities, including lavatories, food and water.Sarah is living in a building in the Jewish quarter with her parents and younger brother. When the gendarmes came calling, she hid him in a wardrobe, locking him in and taking the key. Once they reached the velodrome they realised their mistake in having left little Michelle behind. The Jews were then taken to transit camps before finally going to the death camps including Auschwitz. This was all done by the French authorities, albeit at the behest of their Uber Lords.Meanwhile in the modern day, Julia Jarmond's (Kristen Scott-Thomas) husband has inherited that self same apartment from his ailing mum. Julia is working for a new French magazine and is doing a piece on the `round up' and has done some digging as to who these people were who had been in her new home.The story flits back and forward telling the ordeals of Sarah and her fellow captives, in line with the unfolding truths that Julia finds increasingly difficult to accept. This is an extremely well acted and crafted film that deals with an emotional scar on the French psyche in an open and honest way. President Mitterrand actually apologised for French complicity in these deportations of 76,000 Jews. It took that long for France to face up to that part of her past, but at least she did it. This whole episode was told in a much more acute way in the film `The Round Up'The Round Up ( La rafle ) ( To astro tou fovou ) [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Import - France ], this film has some resonance with that but also `Sophie's Choice'Sophie's Choice. There are fine performances all round and an excellent musical score, the whole thing exudes quality.This is not an action flick and not straightforward good versus evil, as some of the Gendarmes are portrayed as good guys in the wrong place etc. Whilst it does not show some of the grittier sides to the subject in hand, it still faces up to them. It is in French, some English and a smattering of German, that is not always translated. Fans of war history films and Kristen Scott-Thomas will want to see this. A special word has to be said about the performance by Melusine Mayance who plays Sarah, she is utterly convincing, a brilliant performance. Write and director Gilles Paquet-Brennan has made an interesting and thoughtful film, that does him credit.",4,Moving Take on the Jewish Round Up in Paris 1942.,1322006400,"11 23, 2011",2011,2733,"['1942', 'France', 'Nazi', 'jack', 'boot', 'yet', 'thanks', 'plucky', 'resistance', 'fascists', 'are', 'being', 'thwarted', 'turn', 'not', 'turned', 'out', 'tale', 'roots', 'now', 'infamous', 'round', 'Jews', 'Paris', 'summer', '1942', 'were', 'mostly', 'women', 'children', 'were', 'herded', 'city', 'velodrome', 'where', 'were', 'kept', 'stifling', 'temperatures', 'amenities', 'including', 'lavatories', 'food', 'water.Sarah', 'living', 'building', 'Jewish', 'quarter', 'parents', 'younger', 'brother', 'When', 'gendarmes', 'came', 'calling', 'hid', 'wardrobe', 'locking', 'taking', 'key', 'reached', 'velodrome', 'realised', 'mistake', 'having', 'left', 'little', 'Michelle', 'behind', 'Jews', 'were', 'then', 'taken', 'transit', 'camps', 'finally', 'going', 'death', 'camps', 'including', 'Auschwitz', 'was', 'done', 'French', 'authorities', 'albeit', 'behest', 'Uber', 'Lords.Meanwhile', 'modern', 'day', 'Julia', 'Jarmond', 'Kristen', 'Scott-Thomas', 'husband', 'inherited', 'self', 'same', 'apartment', 'ailing', 'mum', 'Julia', 'working', 'new', 'French', 'magazine', 'doing', 'piece', 'round', 'done', 'digging', 'who', 'people', 'were', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'new', 'home.The', 'story', 'flits', 'back', 'forward', 'telling', 'ordeals', 'Sarah', 'fellow', 'captives', 'line', 'unfolding', 'truths', 'Julia', 'increasingly', 'difficult', 'accept', 'extremely', 'well', 'acted', 'crafted', 'film', 'deals', 'emotional', 'scar', 'French', 'psyche', 'open', 'honest', 'way', 'President', 'Mitterrand', 'actually', 'apologised', 'French', 'complicity', 'deportations', '76,000', 'Jews', 'took', 'long', 'France', 'face', 'up', 'part', 'past', 'least', 'did', 'whole', 'episode', 'was', 'told', 'much', 'more', 'acute', 'way', 'film', 'Round', ""Up'The"", 'Round', 'Up', 'La', 'rafle', 'astro', 'tou', 'fovou', 'NON-USA', 'FORMAT', 'PAL', 'Reg.2', 'Import', 'France', ']', 'film', 'resonance', 'also', 'Sophie', ""Choice'Sophie"", 'Choice', 'are', 'fine', 'performances', 'round', 'excellent', 'musical', 'score', 'whole', 'thing', 'exudes', 'quality.This', 'not', 'action', 'flick', 'not', 'straightforward', 'good', 'versus', 'evil', 'Gendarmes', 'are', 'portrayed', 'good', 'guys', 'wrong', 'place', 'etc', 'not', 'show', 'grittier', 'sides', 'subject', 'hand', 'still', 'up', 'French', 'English', 'smattering', 'German', 'not', 'always', 'translated', 'Fans', 'war', 'history', 'films', 'Kristen', 'Scott-Thomas', 'will', 'want', 'see', 'special', 'word', 'be', 'said', 'performance', 'Melusine', 'Mayance', 'who', 'Sarah', 'utterly', 'convincing', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'Write', 'director', 'Gilles', 'Paquet-Brennan', 'made', 'interesting', 'thoughtful', 'film', 'credit']",N/A
1428833,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B004UXUUDA,Tsuyoshi,"[13, 17]","A 2010 French drama ""Sarah's Key"" (""Elle s'appelait Sarah"") has two stories to tell, one about a 10-year-old Sarah Starzynski (M&eacute;lusine Mayance), who hides her younger brother Michel in a secret closet on 16 July, 1942, when Paris police arrested the Jewish population at the orders of the Nazis. Before they are transported by the police, Sarah locks the door, not knowing that she may not be able to come back here again.The other story, set in 2009, is about an American journalist Julia Jarmond (Kristin Scott Thomas), who, after inheriting the apartment Sarah lived in (the fact Julia does not know), starts investigating the truths about the events that happened about 67 years ago.Based on Tatiana De Rosnay's book of the same title (which I haven't read), ""Sarah's Key"" employs a double narrative in which the story goes back and forth in time, and like most double narrative structure, one half of the film is less interesting than the other. I don't think we need the story of Julia, a character we really don't care, despite Kristin Scott Thomas's fine acting for which she was nominated for C&eacute;sar.The real star, or I should say heroine, of the film is M&eacute;lusine Mayance playing young Sarah, who has to go through grueling hardships to keep her promise with her little brother. Unfortunately she exits the story a bit too early, and the film slowly loses momentum after that.

1428834,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B004UXUUDA,Turfseer,"[2, 4]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Sarah's Key features two alternating stories initially set in Paris, one concerning the fate of Sarah, a 10 year old Jewish girl and her family during the Nazi occupation in 1942 and another set in 2009 involving Julia, an American born French journalist, who has been researching the infamous Velodrome d'Hiver incident--a bicycle arena where thousands of French Jews were interned in squalid conditions after being rounded up by the French police upon orders of the Nazis.When Julia discovers that the apartment she and her French born husband are about to move into, bequeathed to them by her husband's family, is the same apartment that belonged to a Jewish family that had been deported, her interest in the fate of French Jewry in World War II becomes personal--something much more than just one of her journalistic assignments. Before you know it, she pays a call to an expert Holocaust researcher who is able to provide her with the names of the deported family, which includes Sarah and her younger brother.Perhaps the most gripping scenes in 'Sarah's Key' involve the deportation of the Jews during the infamous Parisian roundup. The horror is first aptly conveyed in the mother's panicked reaction to the French policeman's orders for everyone in the household to leave (including the children). As the police look for the husband (who is soon to be arrested when he returns home, unaware that the police have arrived), the two children sneak off into another room. Sarah inexplicably locks her younger brother in a closet and keeps the key, expecting soon to return and free him. Things get worse for the family when they're shipped to the Velodrome and they're forced to remain there for days on end, without toilets and in stifling heat. Frightened adults as well as children witness multiple suicides, as despairing deportees jump from the rafters. When the victims are transported to relocation camps, the full horror is conveyed when the parents are separated from their children and are driven off in trucks to death camps.Like many comparable films created by German filmmakers, the scenarists appear to be ambivalent on the subject of homegrown complicity in the Holocaust. One scene illustrates this ambivalence--as the Jews are being deported, one French woman calls out from the window of her apartment, in substance, that the Jews are getting what's coming to them. But another man, in another apartment, yells to the woman, 'they'll come for you next'. Similarly, the villainous French police have one good apple amongst their ranks--the one who allows Sarah and her soon to be dying friend, to crawl under the barbed wire and make their escape from the relocation camp. And yes, there's even a quid pro quo when it comes to villagers: before taken in by the kindly couple, there was that gruff, homeowner who sends the children away without helping them. By mainly focusing on the 'righteous gentile' couple who saves Sarah, the film's scenarists may be giving the wrong impression that there was a equal balance between the bad and the good. In reality, the 'helpers' were few and far between, in occupied France.While it was a bit of a stretch to accept the whole idea that Julia, a person who had already been researching Holocaust history in her job as a journalist, was now directly connected to a horror story involving her husband's family's apartment, the horror story itself proves to be far more contrived. I'm speaking of the whole idea of the kindly husband and wife who who decide to take Sarah back to the apartment to discover the fate of her brother. First of all, the husband wouldn't have had any trouble concluding that the child was dead already if he was still in the closet. So why would he allow Sarah to go up and open the closet, subjecting her to a trauma that haunted her for the rest of her life (until her suicide in 1955). Even more unconvincing is the idea that the husband and wife would have actually brought Sarah along to investigate what happened to the brother. How could they be so sure that the bribe would work when they were on the train? All the husband had to do was make the trip to Paris himself, bring the key and ask the new owner (Julia's husband's grandfather) to open the closet. As Sarah's discovery of her dead brother in the closet is the key moment in the film, and the events leading up to that moment are wholly implausible, the overall impact of the film is diminished.Events depicted in the present day also tend to lessen the film's overall impact. Should we really care about Julia's fight with her husband over whether she should keep the baby? Perhaps if the husband was a more fleshed out character, the interaction between the two of them would have been more compelling.Finally, 'Sarah's Key' asks the question, ""what would you have done?"" had you been under the yoke of Nazi occupation. It's instructive to compare the French and Danes during World War II. Denmark initially faced a much more benign occupation than France--the Nazis allowed them self-government and did not challenge them when they refused to enact laws against the Jews. But when the Nazis changed course in 1943 in Denmark, and a reign of terror did begin (similar to what happened in France), the Danes arranged for their Jewish population to escape by boat to neutral Sweden. In France, due to widespread anti-Semitism, there was little sympathy for the Jews to begin with and no such collective will emerged. The filmmaker's, however, hint that the majority had no choice to act otherwise against the Nazis.'Sarah's Key' does have some affecting moments particularly in its scenes involving the deportation of French Jews, but the film's central dramatic moment is too contrived to be believable.",3,Powerful scenes of deportation of French Jewry diminished by film's contrived central dramatic

WARNING: there may be some spoilers here.I loved Sarah's Key the book, and was eager to see the movie. While the screen version was powerful and mostly well cast, it does not compare favorably to the book. I watched it with a few friends who have not read book, and they were confused by the movie to say the least. I was constantly filling in the story for them and explaining who everybody was. I think that midway through the movie they finally become more invested in the events, but it took a lot of work on my part to get them there.The movie moved too fast without much background information on the characters or the surrounding events. From my friends' point of view - they did not readily understand the Tezac family connections (I had to say ""that's the grandmother in law, that's her husband, etc.), did not see how Sarah's story tied in, etc. The scenes switched so quickly that it was easy to miss the French involvement in Vel d'Hiv or fully comprehend where Jewish people were being taken. It was even hard to know that at one point Julia was in a clinic planning to get an abortion - the movie just showed her in a room taking a call. These are just some of the things that were poorly explained, but there were many more.One thing that bothered me was how minimal a role Julia's husband, Betrand, played in the movie. In the book, he was described as being dashing, charming and at times very mean in his relationship with Julia. In the movie, he was disheveled at best and only appeared a handful at times. It was impossible to truly understand their relationship from those few scenes.Overall, I think that those that have read the book might enjoy seeing it on screen and will be able to fill in missed details.

1428838,A35V32HZEGZH04,B004UXUUDA,"W. Easley ""Opa""","[12, 14]",".A serious story of the French persecution of their Jewish citizens during WWII, Sarah's Key is an impelling tale of a young girl's struggle with her captivity and the consequences of her actions.  Set in Paris in 1942 and 2009, The film switches back and forth between the 1940s and 2000s as the plot develops.The story is told by an American journalist Julia Jarmond (Kristin Scott Thomas) who in 2009 discovers that her French husband's family bought a dwelling that had been occupied by a Jewish family before the internment.  Julia becomes fascinated with the history and resolves to discover the truth concerning the events of 1942.The Jewish family  Wladyslaw and Rywka Starzynski and their children are rounded up by the French police in 1942.  The family lost all their possessions, them they were separated and sent to different work camps before being transported to Auschwitz.Unlike many films about the Holocaust, Sarah's Key does not focus upon the death camps or the killing of thousands of Jews.  Instead, this story is about Sarah who locks her little brother in a closet to protect him when the French police come to arrest her father.  Unfortunately the police take her and her mother as well and sarah is unable to return home to release her brother from the closet.  Sarah becomes focused upon escaping the police so she can rescue her brother.The film does show some of the initial suffering of those Jews who are arrested by the French.  There are several graphic scenes of police brutality and indifference of the general population to the plight of those captured.Julia Jarmond  Kristin Scott Thomas is excellent as Julia Jarmond, and Niels Arestrup is outstanding as the French farmer who aids Sarah.  However ten year old Melisine Mayance carries the movie as the young Sarah Starzynski.  Mayance is talented and according to her director (DVD special effects) a gifted natural actress.Sarah's Key is a gripping movie.  The story is based upon a best selling novel.I recommend this film.",5,Dark Moment in French History,1323820800,"12 14, 2011",2011,2014,"['.A', 'serious', 'story', 'French', 'persecution', 'Jewish', 'citizens', 'WWII', 'Sarah', 'Key', 'impelling', 'tale', 'young', 'girl', 'struggle', 'captivity', 'consequences', 'actions', 'Set', 'Paris', '1942', '2009', 'film', 'back', 'forth', '1940s', '2000s', 'plot', 'develops.The', 'story', 'told', 'American', 'journalist', 'Julia', 'Jarmond', 'Kristin', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'who', '2009', 'discovers', 'French', 'husband', 'family', 'bought', 'dwelling', 'had', 'been', 'occupied', 'Jewish', 'family', 'internment', 'Julia', 'fascinated', 'history', 'discover', 'truth', 'concerning', 'events', '1942.The', 'Jewish', 'family', 'Wladyslaw', 'Rywka', 'Starzynski', 'children', 'are', 'rounded', 'up', 'French', 'police', '1942', 'family', 'lost', 'possessions', 'were', 'separated', 'sent', 'different', 'work', 'camps', 'being', 'transported', 'Auschwitz.Unlike', 'many', 'films', 'Holocaust', 'Sarah', 'Key', 'not', 'focus', 'death', 'camps', 'killing', 'thousands', 'Jews', 'Instead', 'story', 'Sarah', 'who', 'little', 'brother', 'closet', 'protect', 'when', 'French', 'police', 'come', 'arrest', 'father', 'Unfortunately', 'police', 'take', 'mother', 'well', 'sarah', 'unable', 'return', 'home', 'release', 'brother', 'closet', 'Sarah', 'focused', 'escaping', 'police', 'can', 'rescue', 'brother.The', 'film', 'show', 'initial', 'suffering', 'Jews', 'who', 'are', 'arrested', 'French', 'are', 'several', 'graphic', 'scenes', 'police', 'brutality', 'indifference', 'general', 'population', 'plight', 'captured.Julia', 'Jarmond', 'Kristin', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'excellent', 'Julia', 'Jarmond', 'Niels', 'Arestrup', 'outstanding', 'French', 'farmer', 'who', 'Sarah', 'However', 'ten', 'year', 'old', 'Melisine', 'Mayance', 'movie', 'young', 'Sarah', 'Starzynski', 'Mayance', 'talented', 'according', 'director', 'DVD', 'special', 'effects', 'gifted', 'natural', 'actress.Sarah', 'Key', 'gripping', 'movie', 'story', 'based', 'best', 'selling', 'novel.I', 'recommend', 'film']",N/A
