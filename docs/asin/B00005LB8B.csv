It did not make the transition from live theatre to film. Perhaps too big an ask as it requires improvisation and audience participation to flow.

The style is fresh and uncommon today, so the fact these guys aren't that talented is glossed over. Other people who are looking for a post modern, irreverant take on Shakey have jumped on board as well.  Here's the problem: the script may be brilliantly constructed by guys who are too smart for their own good, but they're not good enough to pull off the concept well. Shakespeare wrote some very entertaining plays, not all of them, but some of them.  He wrote excellent tragedy, history, and of course comedy (in both the classical, and modern version).  If you're doing a play with the name in the title, you'd better bring the goods and be as entertaining as a good version of one of his plays.  These guys can't even do it while at least referencing all of them.  Maybe that's the problem with the concept, the bad plays take away the attention from the good ones.  If only they'd gone the princess bride route of only including the best parts then the piece would've been better.

I was exhausted by the end of the DVD, simply because the actors seemed exhausted.  And they should be.  This is a physical presentation, not a cerebrial one.  It gets a little bawdy at times (and is not recommeded for small children, although there were some children in the audience).  Also, I take it that this is a Canadian company, not the original British cast, so some of the British-brittle humor probably has been reworked.

This video of a production starring Reed Martin, Austin Tichenor and Adam Long is as funny as the script was the first time I read it. I was unusual, after having been in the play myself, to see how some of the originators actually envisioned the scenes, as well as how the scenes had evolved in the years since the play was first published -- the Titus Andronicus cooking show, for instance, went from a cross-dressing gag to an Emeril parody. It was still hysterically funny.The DVD also has a surprising amount of special features, including a video of the complete ""Romeo and Juliet"" segment from the first ever production of the show, starring Adam Long, Jess Winfield and Daniel Singer. (It's also interesting to note how THAT scene evolved from the first production until the date of publication.)If you're an RSC fan, this is a great DVD.

The Reduced Shakespeare Company performs all of Shakespeare's works, including the sonnets, in about 90 minutes.  Well, they don't actually perform the sonnets, but they make an appearance, and were I to further comment on that, you would not enjoy it as much!Their Othello rap is one of the funniest things I have ever seen.  They also reduce, rereduce and rerereduce all Shakespeare's comedies to one sentence, then perform them all simultaneously.  (That may not appear to make sense, but trust me, it works!)If you are a fan of Shakespeare, and seeking comedic fare above the average available on DVD, you owe it to yourself and your family to get this DVD.  Whether you see it once or a dozen times, it is guaranteed to get you laughing uncontrollably (seriously, drink beverages while watching this at your own risk!).

This play is very educational, and the more educated you are, the funnier it will be.I first watched this a long time ago, while I was rather ignorant of much of Shakespeare. I recently watched this again, after having read and studied a little Shakespeare, and it was much funnier. Bear in mind, I still do not know much about Shakespeare and his plays, I imagine that this would be nonstop laughs for an English teacher.I only have one minor complaint about the whole show. I thought that the scene in hamlet, where they get the crowd involved, was slightly drawn out. It is wonderful that they have so much crowd involvement, but that scene just never seemed to end.

None of that here.  Generally their improv and audience-participation humor is still there, but you have to wonder how spontaneous it really was in this case.Another oddity:  It was filmed in Vancouver, but at points they maintain the pretense that they're doing their London show (one explicit dialogue reference to being in London, and an passing comment that for a London audience they've got a lot of Americans).

My son and I decided to to go based solely on the play's title, and a winking characature of Shakespeare displayed on the poster. Little did we know what that wink signified, as we had no idea of the lunacy that was in store for us.  When ""The Reduced Shakespeare Company"" came available on VHS (then, later, DVD), I purchased it, and have been enjoying and sharing it ever since.As a secondary English teacher, I have difficulty sometimes getting my students to embrace the classics.  When I mention Shakespeare, eyes roll, heads fall onto desks, and moans can be heard.  It's like getting a small child to eat his vegetables.  Like broccoli, the classics are good for us, but they're hard for some to digest.Enter the Reduced Shakespeare Company with its ""The Complete Works of ""William Shakespeare (Abridged).""  I have used excerpts in class to show the kids that Shakespeare can be a lot of fun.  With their more-or-less complete versions of ""Romeo and Juliet"" and ""Hamlet,"" even my most resistant students know the major plot points and themes of these plays.The overview of the other plays is inspired, lumping the main ideas of Shakespeare's comedies into one tossed-salad.  The histories are also compressed in a manner that only Americans could have devised.And, one can never view ""Othello"" in quite the same way after hearing the ""Reduced Shakesperians"" rendition of ""Othello Rap.""This performance is much more (or less) than a teaching tool.  It is a rollicking, comedic fun time for all.  If you like Shakespeare already, you'll like the witty satire going on here.  If you like the Three Stooges, the slapstick is right up your alley.  If you have a short attention span, don't worry.  One can view this performance as a whole, or pick out bits one finds amusing.I have viewed ""The Complete Works"" several times now, both with my family and with my students, and each time I find a new joke, or even a new insight, that I missed earlier.Some have suggested that Shakespeare is perhaps rolling in his grave at this treatment of his plays.

That is not to say it isn't worthwhile, thus the 4 stars I gave it. Those who know a little about Shakespeare will probably find it funnier than those who do not. They do spend a lot of time on the better known plays: Romeo and Juliet, MacBeth, and Hamlet, so most viewers will know at least some of the material. They occasionally go into madcap, slapstick type moments, which will probably be funny to about anyone, but they also go painfully close to being silly at times.

662510,A9MAUO67ABVOB,B00005LB8B,"F. Behrens ""Frank Behrens""","[84, 89]","When the Reduced Shakespeare Company performs &lt;The Complete Works of William Shakespeare (abridged)&gt;, it is a case of three apparently indefatigable actors (Adam Long, Reed Martin, Austin Tichenor) whirlwinding through the plays, some of which are barely mentioned, some of which are treated at greater length--all in 90 minutes. Well,  the Good News is that the show is now available from Acorn Media on a VHS. (Note: this video contains material not shown on PBS.)To cut to the chase, you really have to know your Bard to get all the jokes. Treating &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot; as a cooking class works if you are familiar enough with the plot (the recent movie might help here); and unless you know your English kings from Richard II to Richard III (with all the Henrys in the middle), the football game with a crown as ball will have little meaning. ( I thought the line about cutting Henry VI into three parts was the best in this sketch.)Possibly the bit that calls for the audience's greatest degree of  knowledge and concentration is the resume of a plot that combines all the Shakespearean comedies into a single play (with a very long title). There are plenty of in-jokes and bad puns throughout Act I to demand your fullest attention--and again, few of them work if you do not know the originals.The first act ends with a little situation in which one of the troupe refuses to do &quot;Hamlet&quot; and flees from the theater. When Act II begins, he has not been brought back and the remaining actor must fill the time with Monty Python-like bad routines. Once back on track, the audience is enlisted to help one of their number (I assume she is not a plant) &quot;feel&quot; the part of Ophelia. The trio's versatility is put to the test at the very end when they repeat the entire Hamlet production quickly, then very quickly, and finally very quickly and backwards!So all in all, this is a joyous romp for those &quot;in the know&quot; and one that might seem pretty pointless for those who have avoided Shakespeare once school was over. Therefore I must give it 4 stars out of 5 in general, although it deserves 5-plus for those who have stuck with the iambics all these years.A perfect gift for your English teacher, by the way.

This production is about 90 minutes long and presents Shakespeare's plays in slapstick, silly way that is fun.The title of this being complete is a bit misleading. The players mainly take on Romeo and Juliet and Hamlet, with quick productions of Othello (a hilarious rap) and Titus Andronicus (Cooking With Titus). In this respect, those who purchase this should know that many of the other plays are grouped together in bulk segments (they lump all the comedies into one skit) and that these are comedic interpretations of the plays and not summaries.It is understandable because this was improvisation, but the ""I don't want to do Hamlet"" joke, with one of the actors, was a little long. The joke could have been carried out for a few minutes, but they went a little on for quite a while. Also, the Ophelia ""madness"" part went far too long as well, although the way they were able to get the audience involved was great.The other aspects of this video were exceptional as well. There was really never a dull moment, mainly because they had to keep the action moving quickly to get through everything, but also because the players had a knack for making even the most remote instance or mess up funny. Also, this video is a resourceful production for many different people-the Shakespeare fan and the Reluctant Shakespeare fan. Because the interpretations are brief and comical, it is really not imperative to know all the Shakespeare plays. If you do know Shakespeare, you can catch the other jokes within the mini-plays (like the cursed MacBeth scene).Another effective aspect of this film is the actor's ability to make something ""dry"" seem fun and entertaining. And this does hold a small amount of educational value for the simple fact that it is a resource that will build interest in learning Shakespeare plays. (However, you should be forewarned that there are a few scenes that are suggestive and a bit of bad language).In addition to the Hamlet production, which encompasses about 30-40 minutes of the play, there are several hilarious encore versions of Hamlet, two super-quick versions and a ""backwards"" version as well.

I did not - until yesterday when I saw The ""Reduced Shakespeare Company - The Complete Works of William Shakespeare (Abridged)"" slapstick show that actually compresses all bard's plays in the 90 minutes of wild ride and pure hilarity. Three members of The Reduced Shakespeare Company Adam Long, Reed Martin, and Austin Tichenor act, comment, sing, and not only entertain their theatric audiences but also make them participate in the most hilarious production of ""Hamlet"" I ever seen. If you never read or seen any stage or screen adaptations of a Shakespeare's play, you still will enjoy the show thanks to the great timing, perfect communication among three performers, and unorthodox but always hysterical way to present each of the celebrated works by the most revered author. As it was the case in the 16th Century's theater, where the male actors play the female heroines, Adam Long plays tragic characters Gertrude, Cleopatra, Juliet, and Ophelia and he is incredibly funny yet strangely sympathetic as the unfortunate ladies. Long, Tichenor who plays always serious scholar and Martin, the clown, acrobat, musician and illusionist of the show all complete one another beautifully. Adam Long and Reed Martin together wrote the script to the show, and found some very original and enjoyable ideas on how to present the plays, all 37 of them in such short period of time. I liked Titus Andronicus Cooking Horror Show. I had a lot of fun listening to and watching ""Othello"" as a rap song:""Here's the story of a brother by the name of Othello.He liked white women, and he liked... green... Jell-O.Hey, yeah! And a punk named Iago, made himself a menace becauseHe didn't like Othello, the moor of Venice!""I absolutely adore the idea of condensing all 17 the comedies in one long sentence that was made up of all the titles to leave more times for the tragedies (because I agree with Adam, Reed, and Austin that Shakespeare's tragedies are funnier).After enjoying so much ""The Complete Works of William Shakespeare (abridged)"", I am ready for the others Reduced Shakespeare Company's projects, ""The Bible: The Complete Word of God (abridged)"", ""The Complete History of America (abridged)"", ""Western Civilization: The Complete Musical (abridged)"", ""All The Great Books (abridged)"" , and ""Completely Hollywood (abridged)"".",4,37 Shakespeare's plays in one incredibly funny show,1198195200,"12 21, 2007",2007,2481,"['Do', 'know', 'possible', 'see', '37', 'plays', 'playwright', 'who', 'considered', 'many', 'greatest', 'ever', 'lived', 'show', 'two', 'hours', 'did', 'not', 'yesterday', 'when', 'saw', 'Reduced', 'Shakespeare', 'Company', 'Complete', 'Works', 'William', 'Shakespeare', 'Abridged', 'slapstick', 'show', 'actually', 'bard', 'plays', '90', 'minutes', 'wild', 'ride', 'pure', 'hilarity', 'Three', 'members', 'Reduced', 'Shakespeare', 'Company', 'Adam', 'Long', 'Reed', 'Martin', 'Austin', 'Tichenor', 'act', 'comment', 'sing', 'not', 'only', 'entertain', 'theatric', 'audiences', 'also', 'make', 'participate', 'most', 'hilarious', 'production', 'Hamlet', 'ever', 'seen', 'never', 'read', 'seen', 'stage', 'screen', 'adaptations', 'Shakespeare', 'play', 'still', 'will', 'enjoy', 'show', 'great', 'timing', 'perfect', 'communication', 'three', 'performers', 'unorthodox', 'always', 'hysterical', 'way', 'present', 'celebrated', 'works', 'most', 'revered', 'author', 'was', 'case', '16th', 'Century', 'theater', 'where', 'male', 'actors', 'play', 'female', 'heroines', 'Adam', 'Long', 'tragic', 'characters', 'Gertrude', 'Cleopatra', 'Juliet', 'Ophelia', 'incredibly', 'funny', 'yet', 'strangely', 'sympathetic', 'unfortunate', 'ladies', 'Long', 'Tichenor', 'who', 'always', 'serious', 'scholar', 'Martin', 'clown', 'acrobat', 'musician', 'illusionist', 'show', 'complete', 'one', 'beautifully', 'Adam', 'Long', 'Reed', 'Martin', 'together', 'wrote', 'script', 'show', 'found', 'very', 'original', 'enjoyable', 'ideas', 'how', 'present', 'plays', '37', 'such', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'liked', 'Titus', 'Andronicus', 'Cooking', 'Horror', 'Show', 'had', 'lot', 'fun', 'listening', 'watching', 'Othello', 'rap', 'song', 'Here', 'story', 'brother', 'name', 'Othello.He', 'liked', 'white', 'women', 'liked', 'green', 'Jell-O.Hey', 'yeah', 'punk', 'named', 'Iago', 'made', 'menace', 'becauseHe', 'did', ""n't"", 'Othello', 'moor', 'Venice', 'absolutely', 'adore', 'idea', 'condensing', '17', 'comedies', 'one', 'long', 'sentence', 'was', 'made', 'titles', 'leave', 'more', 'times', 'tragedies', 'agree', 'Adam', 'Reed', 'Austin', 'Shakespeare', 'tragedies', 'are', 'funnier', '.After', 'enjoying', 'so', 'much', 'Complete', 'Works', 'William', 'Shakespeare', 'abridged', 'am', 'ready', 'others', 'Reduced', 'Shakespeare', 'Company', 'projects', 'Bible', 'Complete', 'Word', 'God', 'abridged', 'Complete', 'History', 'America', 'abridged', 'Western', 'Civilization', 'Complete', 'Musical', 'abridged', 'Great', 'Books', 'abridged', 'Completely', 'Hollywood', 'abridged']",The Reduced Shakespeare Company - The Complete Works of William Shakespeare Abridged  VHS

Unsure about it's content, I bought it used, both my wife and I were laughing uncontrollable. Caution: keep the pause button at a fingers length because you will need to use it frequently to allow your own laughter to subside. Otherwise you will miss some of the very fast paced gags and dialogue that never seem to slow down for laughing periods.Being review #100, and the first review of 2010, for a DVD that was released seven years ago seems frivolous. But this comedy team, it's content, and she sheer delight of comedy entertainment, regardless of your academic knowledge of Shakespeare, demands a review...6 stars if it were allowed.  And it's impossible to pick out a segment or a point in the production to call the pinnacle of it's comedy.  It is 88 minutes of continual amusement at the expense of a sacrilege abridgment of The complete Works of William S.  The acting and antics of Adam Long, Reed Martin, & Austin Tichenor, clowns all, are in themselves worthy of the experience even if your inexperience with Shakespeare allow none of the subtle bits connected with the bards writing. Props rival those of Gallagher and his ""sledge-o-matic."" Audience interaction is as funny as the stage production.  Costumes add to the humor.  The 3 brilliant players occasional tickle their own funny bones similar to the self-amusement of Red Skelton.Also be ready with the reverse on the remote. In ""Hamlet"" the side-splitting is so fast you'll find yourself backing up to catch all the humor, all the dialogue, all the antics, & all the Shakespearean abuse.  SUBTITLES and/or CC help in catching all of the super fast ridiculous take on Shakespeare. And when it's all over, and your breath recovers (and those side aches from laughing) there's plenty of special features.  The DVD case warning says it all: ""High-speed hilarity.

I never heard of these guys or their work before, but was truly astounded at how good it was.Briefly (and not to bore those who have read the other numerous reviews), the trio do quick Shakespeare, condensing his works into very quick, silly skits.  ""Hamlet"" at the end is the longest of them, and other well-known works (""Romeo and Juliet"" and ""Macbeth"" being most notable) are just as funny.  I was confused by the numerous ""Shakespeare comedies"" compiled into one maddening one, with quick-paced dialogue, editing from each actor's face.  I only caught 4 of them, just because I know them.  Unfortunately, I am not all that immersed in the lesser Shakespeare works, but neither were the children in the audience to whom they performed.It didn't matter, though.  This is good stuff.  As a fan of ""Rosecranz and Guilderstern are Dead,"" I found the acting and dialogue absolutely brilliant, and the DVD certainly needs to be viewed many times to catch some of the crazy lines.""Othello"" to rap, calling Hamlet ""Omelet, the Cheese Danish"" and doing the skit quickly backwards, and the great audience interaction with the ""Hamlet"" skit were all high points (if the rest of the show wasn't).It's great for children, and truly full of talent.4 1/2 of 5.
