It is an awesome story of a woman back in the 1800's who became a doctor and then chooses to go back up in the hills to help the backwoods community she grew up in. She encounters resistance and fear and butts head with the local medicine woman.

There were several very short pauses in the dvd when it appeared a commercial may have been inserted.  Also, there were a couple of areas when the dvd briefly ""broke up"".  But, I didn't think it was significant enough to warrant return. If you're into folklore of the ""blue ridge"" mountains, I believe this movie would interest you.  Basically, a young doctor (Lindsay Wagner) suffers hardships when she tries to bring modern medicine to distrusting mountain families that were only accustomed to the natural cures given to them by their ""mountain medicine woman"" (Jane Wyman).",4,"Interesting movie...Modern medicine vs. ""Mountain"" cures",1299974400,"03 13, 2011",2011,656,"['saw', 'movie', 'tv', 'years', 'ago', 'finally', 'was', 'able', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'were', 'several', 'very', 'short', 'pauses', 'dvd', 'when', 'appeared', 'commercial', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'inserted', 'Also', 'were', 'couple', 'areas', 'when', 'dvd', 'briefly', 'broke', 'up', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'significant', 'enough', 'warrant', 'return', ""'re"", 'folklore', 'blue', 'ridge', 'mountains', 'believe', 'movie', 'would', 'interest', 'Basically', 'young', 'doctor', 'Lindsay', 'Wagner', 'suffers', 'hardships', 'when', 'bring', 'modern', 'medicine', 'distrusting', 'mountain', 'families', 'were', 'only', 'accustomed', 'natural', 'cures', 'given', 'mountain', 'medicine', 'woman', 'Jane', 'Wyman']",N/A
