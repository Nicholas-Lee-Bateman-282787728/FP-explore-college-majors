1053290,AAU41YPXU53F2,B000N3T3Z2,Amazon Customer,"[37, 37]","I have been practicing yoga for almost 2 years now but I am still a beginner. I can't do arm balances or head stands but I can do most of the basic poses. I found Ease Into Ashtanga challenging without being overwhelming. This DVD is the full Ashtanga Primary series. The DVD is broken up into lessons where each pose is explained fully with modifications. Then once you master the poses, you can do one of 4 flows...the full 90 minute flow, a 60 minute, 40 minute and 30 minute flow. You can also pick which instructor's voice you want (out of 3). They even explain proper sitting and breathing. It is a very thorough DVD and one that a beginner can grow into. I think it is challenging enough for intermediate and advanced yoga students as well since they will probably be able to get into the full poses (very challenging!) rather than the modifications. It's a fun DVD and never boring. Minimal chatter which is refreshing. Plus, Ashtanga is a lot of fun and super conditioning!",5,One of the best Ashtanga DVDs on the market!,1223251200,"10 6, 2008",2008,982,"['have', 'been', 'practicing', 'yoga', 'almost', '2', 'years', 'now', 'am', 'still', 'beginner', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'arm', 'balances', 'head', 'stands', 'can', 'do', 'most', 'basic', 'poses', 'found', 'Ease', 'Into', 'Ashtanga', 'challenging', 'being', 'overwhelming', 'DVD', 'full', 'Ashtanga', 'Primary', 'series', 'DVD', 'broken', 'up', 'lessons', 'where', 'pose', 'explained', 'fully', 'modifications', 'Then', 'once', 'master', 'poses', 'can', 'do', 'one', '4', 'flows', 'full', '90', 'minute', 'flow', '60', 'minute', '40', 'minute', '30', 'minute', 'flow', 'can', 'also', 'pick', 'instructor', 'voice', 'want', '3', 'even', 'explain', 'proper', 'sitting', 'breathing', 'very', 'thorough', 'DVD', 'one', 'beginner', 'can', 'grow', 'think', 'challenging', 'enough', 'intermediate', 'advanced', 'yoga', 'students', 'well', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'full', 'poses', 'very', 'challenging', 'rather', 'modifications', 'fun', 'DVD', 'never', 'boring', 'Minimal', 'chatter', 'refreshing', 'Ashtanga', 'lot', 'fun', 'super', 'conditioning']",Ease Into Ashtanga

There are a lot of things that I personally find annoying.  The first might be the main instructor's voice during the 'lesson' part of the video...sounds at times like a duck quacking...not particularly soothing.  I cannot find fault with the instruction itself, but her high school gym teacher delivery is less than inspiring.Of course, one can change the voice over for the flow sessions, but I find there are a lot of 'gaps' with the alternate instructors.  This becomes a problem when the pace picks up and I have to keep turning my head to the screen to figure out what the next pose is....I'm in a forward lunge while the other practitioners are in a downward facing dog.  To me, ""Drop your shoulder blades"" does not mean ""step back into downward facing dog.""Other reviewers have mentioned the beautiful Hawaiian scenery or the trim and toned bodies of the other yogis on the beach.  Although these might be pleasant distractions, they are distractions nonetheless.  Why didn't they choose two or three different people for each of the 30, 40, 50 and 60 minute sessions?Given the price and the length of this DVD, I would also have liked to see a few balance poses or inversions but I suppose they would have interrupted the ashtanga flow.",2,"Tedious, uneven instruction",1332633600,"03 25, 2012",2012,1377,"['OK', 'what', 'am', 'missing', 'read', 'glowing', 'reviews', 'high', 'price', 'single', 'DVD', 'thought', 'would', 'try', 'out', 'are', 'lot', 'things', 'personally', 'find', 'annoying', 'first', 'might', 'be', 'main', 'instructor', 'voice', ""'lesson"", 'part', 'video', 'times', 'duck', 'quacking', 'not', 'particularly', 'soothing', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'fault', 'instruction', 'high', 'school', 'gym', 'teacher', 'delivery', 'less', 'inspiring.Of', 'course', 'one', 'can', 'change', 'voice', 'flow', 'sessions', 'find', 'are', 'lot', ""'gaps"", 'alternate', 'instructors', 'problem', 'when', 'pace', 'have', 'keep', 'turning', 'head', 'screen', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'next', 'pose', '.I', ""'m"", 'forward', 'lunge', 'other', 'practitioners', 'are', 'downward', 'facing', 'dog', 'Drop', 'shoulder', 'blades', 'not', 'mean', 'step', 'back', 'downward', 'facing', 'dog', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'mentioned', 'beautiful', 'Hawaiian', 'scenery', 'trim', 'toned', 'bodies', 'other', 'yogis', 'beach', 'might', 'be', 'pleasant', 'distractions', 'are', 'distractions', 'nonetheless', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'choose', 'two', 'three', 'different', 'people', '30', '40', '50', '60', 'minute', 'sessions', 'Given', 'price', 'length', 'DVD', 'would', 'also', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'few', 'balance', 'poses', 'inversions', 'suppose', 'would', 'have', 'interrupted', 'ashtanga', 'flow']",Ease Into Ashtanga

1053293,AXPO46JYKP8NQ,B000N3T3Z2,Ms Muffintop,"[12, 12]","I keep trying to like Ashtanga. It is a very popular style of yoga.  It will build muscle strength.  It is beautiful to watch people do.  This video is filmed in beautiful Hawai'i with lots of strong good looking people.  The instructive portion of the tape was very instructive. A friendly looking woman with two models shows how the same pose may look different on two different people.  She is very reassuring.But here's the thing, Ashtanga is Ashtanga, is Ashtanga - there's no way to make it easier, easy or to ease into it.  The poses change too rapidly for me! I can barely keep up with these guys and I have no time to check my alignment!  If you are already steady in your Ashtanga practice, none of this is going to bother you.  You will enjoy the music, the filming and the instructive features.If like me, you already purchased the David Svenson video and hoped this video would be easier, based on the name ""Ease into Ashtanga"" you may be disappointed to discover - it's exactly the same sequence.  Well, of course it is.  They can't really do anything else and still call it Ashtanga.  Ultimately I think the only way to ""ease"" into Ashtanga, is to find an Ashtanga instructor.  In a studio, the instructor won't teach you the next part of the sequence until you are proficient with the beginning moves.",3,I like the instructive part of the video,1329004800,"02 12, 2012",2012,1317,"['keep', 'trying', 'like', 'Ashtanga', 'very', 'popular', 'style', 'yoga', 'will', 'build', 'muscle', 'strength', 'beautiful', 'watch', 'people', 'do', 'video', 'filmed', 'beautiful', 'Hawai', 'i', 'lots', 'strong', 'good', 'looking', 'people', 'instructive', 'portion', 'tape', 'was', 'very', 'instructive', 'friendly', 'looking', 'woman', 'two', 'models', 'how', 'same', 'pose', 'may', 'look', 'different', 'two', 'different', 'people', 'very', 'reassuring.But', 'here', 'thing', 'Ashtanga', 'Ashtanga', 'Ashtanga', 'way', 'make', 'easier', 'easy', 'ease', 'poses', 'change', 'too', 'rapidly', 'can', 'barely', 'keep', 'up', 'guys', 'have', 'time', 'check', 'alignment', 'are', 'already', 'steady', 'Ashtanga', 'practice', 'none', 'going', 'bother', 'will', 'enjoy', 'music', 'filming', 'instructive', 'features.If', 'already', 'purchased', 'David', 'Svenson', 'video', 'hoped', 'video', 'would', 'be', 'easier', 'based', 'name', 'Ease', 'Ashtanga', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed', 'discover', 'exactly', 'same', 'sequence', 'Well', 'course', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'anything', 'else', 'still', 'call', 'Ashtanga', 'Ultimately', 'think', 'only', 'way', 'ease', 'Ashtanga', 'find', 'Ashtanga', 'instructor', 'studio', 'instructor', 'wo', ""n't"", 'teach', 'next', 'part', 'sequence', 'are', 'proficient', 'beginning', 'moves']",Ease Into Ashtanga

1053295,A3260GM8VU5712,B000N3T3Z2,T. Burrows,"[8, 12]","I take a regular Ashtanga class with an excellent teacher, so I am familiar with the routine and the poses.  For someone like me, it is a decent substitute for going to class.  However, it could not replace  working with a good teacher who can spot mistakes and correct alignment.  The energy of the other students is a part of the experience too.  If you are new to Ashtanga, this will introduce you to the practice - but it cannot replace being in a good class with a good teacher.  You should definitely take a class somewhere before trying it on your own.This video does provide several interesting features, such as introductions to the poses and various shorter versions of the routine.  The Hawaiian coastal background is attractive, and the videography is fine - but the video does not deliver on all it promises.  There was no way to change the speaker or the background music, for one thing.  Also, the shorter versions of the routine are just edited versions of the same routine, i.e., the longer video with chunks cut out of it.  And most importantly, the teacher's verbal cues, while not bad, are only average.  In my opinion, my teacher (Stephanye Dussud) could have done a better job.Despite these flaws, this is still a worthwhile purchase that I use regularly.  There is a lack of good Ashtanga videos, and I thank Yoga Hawaii and the video company for making this.  Hopefully they can add some improvements to later editions.  If they were to release versions of the Series 2 or the Moon Series, I would gladly purchase them and use them also.",4,A solid Ashtanga video that does not deliver on all its promises,1232496000,"01 21, 2009",2009,1561,"['take', 'regular', 'Ashtanga', 'class', 'excellent', 'teacher', 'am', 'familiar', 'routine', 'poses', 'someone', 'decent', 'substitute', 'going', 'class', 'However', 'could', 'not', 'replace', 'working', 'good', 'teacher', 'who', 'can', 'spot', 'mistakes', 'correct', 'alignment', 'energy', 'other', 'students', 'part', 'experience', 'too', 'are', 'new', 'Ashtanga', 'will', 'introduce', 'practice', 'can', 'not', 'replace', 'being', 'good', 'class', 'good', 'teacher', 'should', 'definitely', 'take', 'class', 'somewhere', 'trying', 'own.This', 'video', 'provide', 'several', 'interesting', 'features', 'such', 'introductions', 'poses', 'various', 'shorter', 'versions', 'routine', 'Hawaiian', 'coastal', 'background', 'attractive', 'videography', 'fine', 'video', 'not', 'deliver', 'was', 'way', 'change', 'speaker', 'background', 'music', 'one', 'thing', 'Also', 'shorter', 'versions', 'routine', 'are', 'just', 'edited', 'versions', 'same', 'routine', 'i.e.', 'longer', 'video', 'chunks', 'cut', 'most', 'importantly', 'teacher', 'verbal', 'cues', 'not', 'bad', 'are', 'only', 'average', 'opinion', 'teacher', 'Stephanye', 'Dussud', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'job.Despite', 'flaws', 'still', 'worthwhile', 'purchase', 'use', 'regularly', 'lack', 'good', 'Ashtanga', 'videos', 'thank', 'Yoga', 'Hawaii', 'video', 'company', 'making', 'Hopefully', 'can', 'add', 'improvements', 'later', 'editions', 'were', 'release', 'versions', 'Series', '2', 'Moon', 'Series', 'would', 'gladly', 'purchase', 'use', 'also']",Ease Into Ashtanga
