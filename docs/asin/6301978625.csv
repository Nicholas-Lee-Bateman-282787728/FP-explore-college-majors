The script was corny and poorly written, the subs and ships looked suspiciously like the ones I used to play with in the bathtub, and the sets depicting the inside of the subs were so roomy that both Glenn Ford and Ernest Borgnine were able to wear their hats almost the entire time. And Ford wore a jacket, despite the fact that real submarines were almost unbearably hot, especially while being depthcharged.The sub skippers also kept their periscopes up so long the entire Japanese navy could have spotted them. And the crew was able to launch three torpedoes from the same tube in rapid succession.Frankly, they should have changed the name of Borgnine's character to ""McHale"" and added some jokes and a laugh track. It's hard to believe people would have shelled out good money to see this trash, even in 1958.Movies don't get any worse than this.

The first attempt ends up with Glen Ford's character sinking a ship with his wife and baby on it instead of the carrier he was attacking.He does better on the second attempt, although his sub ends ups getting sunk (he and his crew are saved by another US sub).Very little in the movie is actually believable as far as something that could actually happen. Late in the movie there is an underwater maneuvering sequence in a minefield. I have no idea how he went around the moored mines. Maybe ESP.But, despite the complete implausibility of much of the movie I enjoy it when I watch it on cable TV periodically.Ernest Borgnine plays his executive officer.

Some people think it is &quot;stupid&quot;, but I think if it were actually them there in his shoes they may have did the same thing. If he did not fire on the carrier using the prison ship screen, his superiors may have considered him unfit for command. This would have made him ashamed of himself in front of his only remaining family: the U.S. Navy. However, I think he could have set the torpedo depth deep enough to shoot under said ship and hit the carrier (I am a hardcore sub-sim gamer).

I couldn't get over the way the screenwriters stacked the deck so that no matter which way Doyle decided to go, he just couldn't live with himself.  His duty towards his country, versus his love for his family.  In a way, Glenn Ford's performance will remind you of George C. Scott playing Abraham in John Huston's film of THE BIBLE, trying to make his conscience obey God's directive to slay his oldest son in sacrifice on the abandoned mountain.  Ernest Borgnine, as his best friend (more of a lackey than a friend) tries to understand what Ford is doing, but who could possibly follow all the moral conundrums a sub commander must face?Joseph Pevney the director, brings this all to life in some tensely charged scenes where the men under Doyle's command react in all different ways to their commander's apparent hardness.  Pevney is especially good with aquatic sequences and had previously made the Joan Crawford scorcher FEMALE ON THE BEACH.  And who could forget the epic AWAY ALL BOATS, with the incredible line up of Julie Adams, Keith Andes, Lex Barker, Richard Boone, Jeff Chandler, Clint Eastwood and David Janssen--and George Nader for good measure!  Pevney's talent for nail-biting suspense come in handy here on TORPEDO RUN just as they had at the beginning of his long career when he maneuevered scenery-chewers Charles Laughton and Boris Karloff through their paces in THE STRANGE DOOR.  Glenn Ford isn't any Charles Laughton but he acts just as nutty as Commander Doyle.Glenn Ford is in danger of becoming the forgotten superstar!  He was once one of the reliable box office top tens, and none of his pictures ever lost a dime.  Studios clamored for his services, though he had a longterm association with Columbia where he was sometimes featured with real-life love interest Rita Hayworth.  In the 1950s his star continued to rise and he made classic after classic, often in military roles where he seemed to shine.  The truth is he was good at every kind of part, from drama to westerns to contemporary roles and light comedy.  Remember him as Pa Kent in SUPERMAN?  That was just one of the things he could do well, for he inspired trust and loyalty, and his fans responded.  Now most of them are quite old, but if properly marketed, I think Glenn Ford could enjoy an enormous revival among the young.  Ernest Borgnine too!

288352,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,6301978625,magellan,"[9, 10]","I've seen at least eight different sub movies: Run Silent, Run Deep, The Enemy Below, Das Boot, U-571, Torpedo Alley, The Hunt for Red October, K-19 the Widowmaker, and this one. (Does the SF TV series, ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Toilet Bowl,"" count? How about the Beattles' ""Yellow Submarine? That would be nine). :-)Although maybe not in the same class as Run Silent, Run Deep (what is?), this is still a pretty good sub flick. I say that with a couple of reservations, as it's sort of like the Yellow Brick Road of sub war movies, because of the apparently crazy or excessively risk-taking behavior of the captain, played by Glenn Ford. In one scene, Ford makes the dangerous decision to shoot the Japanese aircraft carrier hiding behind a transport ship although 1400 American POWs (including his own wife and family) are on board the transport. He misses and sinks the transport. It's not made clear why he couldn't move around to the other side of the carrier, which is using the transport as a human shield.However, another scene where they must negotiate the underwater minefield in Tokyo harbor to get inside the Japanese defenses is suspenseful and well done. Glenn Ford craftily gets the sub both in and out of the harbor without being detected, sinking a ship in the process. They snag a couple of mine mooring lines, which sound pretty creepy as the lines scrape along the side of the hull, but none explode.Good ol' Glenn Ford manages to project an aura of avuncular warmth and thoughtfulness despite being the stern, serious, sub captain who obviously intends to live life on the edge--even for submarine warfare--even if that means sending his ship to the bottom--which he does in another scene, although the crew manages to escape. Ernest Borgnine is also good in his supporting role. Overall a pretty decent submarine war movie despite not a few implausible elements.",4,Entertaining sub flick,1056326400,"06 23, 2003",2003,1887,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'least', 'eight', 'different', 'sub', 'movies', 'Run', 'Silent', 'Run', 'Deep', 'Enemy', 'Below', 'Das', 'Boot', 'U-571', 'Torpedo', 'Alley', 'Hunt', 'Red', 'October', 'K-19', 'Widowmaker', 'one', 'SF', 'TV', 'series', 'Voyage', 'Bottom', 'Toilet', 'Bowl', 'count', 'How', 'Beattles', 'Yellow', 'Submarine', 'would', 'be', 'nine', 'maybe', 'not', 'same', 'class', 'Run', 'Silent', 'Run', 'Deep', 'what', 'still', 'pretty', 'good', 'sub', 'flick', 'say', 'couple', 'reservations', 'sort', 'Yellow', 'Brick', 'Road', 'sub', 'war', 'movies', 'apparently', 'crazy', 'excessively', 'risk-taking', 'behavior', 'captain', 'played', 'Glenn', 'Ford', 'one', 'scene', 'Ford', 'dangerous', 'decision', 'shoot', 'Japanese', 'aircraft', 'carrier', 'hiding', 'transport', 'ship', '1400', 'American', 'POWs', 'including', 'own', 'wife', 'family', 'are', 'board', 'transport', 'transport', 'not', 'made', 'clear', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'move', 'around', 'other', 'side', 'carrier', 'using', 'transport', 'human', 'shield.However', 'scene', 'where', 'must', 'negotiate', 'underwater', 'minefield', 'Tokyo', 'harbor', 'get', 'Japanese', 'defenses', 'suspenseful', 'well', 'done', 'Glenn', 'Ford', 'craftily', 'sub', 'harbor', 'being', 'detected', 'sinking', 'ship', 'process', 'snag', 'couple', 'mine', 'mooring', 'lines', 'sound', 'pretty', 'creepy', 'lines', 'scrape', 'side', 'hull', 'none', 'explode.Good', 'ol', 'Glenn', 'Ford', 'project', 'aura', 'avuncular', 'warmth', 'thoughtfulness', 'being', 'stern', 'serious', 'sub', 'captain', 'who', 'obviously', 'live', 'life', 'edge', 'even', 'submarine', 'warfare', 'even', 'sending', 'ship', 'bottom', 'scene', 'crew', 'escape', 'Ernest', 'Borgnine', 'also', 'good', 'supporting', 'role', 'Overall', 'pretty', 'decent', 'submarine', 'war', 'movie', 'not', 'few', 'implausible', 'elements']",N/A

The movie tells the story of Lt. Commander Barney Doyle and his submarine, the Greyfish.  After Doyle accidentally sinks a prisoner transport, with his wife and child on board, he becomes obsessed with going after the ship he intended to sink, the Japanese carrier, Shinaru.  Doyle will sink the Shinaru at any cost which puts his sub and crew at risk.  Torpedo Run is one of the best war movies made about submarine warfare.  If you like this movie, I recommend Run Silent, Run Deep and Up Periscope.  For a tense, exciting war adventure set in the Pacific theater, I highly recommend Torpedo Run.Glenn Ford is good, as always, as Lt. Commander Barney Doyle, who attempts to sink the Japanese carrier, Shinaru, at all costs.  Ernest Borgnine is equally as good as Doyle's executive officer and second-in-command, Lt. Archer Sloan, who turns down a promotion to remain with Doyle on the Greyfish.  In a smaller part, Diane Brewster plays Doyle's wife, Jane.  The rest of the crew includes Dean Jones as Lt. Jake &quot;Fuzz&quot; Foley, a young, inexperienced officer on board, L.Q. Jones, Robert Hardy, and Paul Picerni.  The movie also stars Philip Ober and Richard Carlyle.  The Torpedo Run VHS is of decent quality, but this submarine movie deserves a DVD release in widescreen presentation as is shown on Turner Classic Movies.
