748369,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,B00008WI9O,A Customer,"[2, 3]","Summary:Earl Montgomery (Martin Lawrence) is a wannabe cop whose attitude is keeping him from getting pretty much anywhere in life.  Hank Rafferty (Steve Zahn), on the other hand, used to be a cop until, being a bit emotionally unstable after his partner was killed, he is accused of roughing up Earl and ends up convicted of police brutality and being sent to jail.Six months later Hank's out of jail and the only job he can get is for National Security as a security guard.  Ironically, Earl, who flunked out of the police academy, is also working for the same company.  Despite having had so many problems, Hank is still determined to get the guys that killed his partner and, in essence, ruined his life.  When he hears about a similar heist going down he heads for the warehouse where the heist is taking place only to find that Earl is supposed to be the security guard on duty (he's upstairs having sex with some woman, supposedly a secretary).When Hank arrives on the scene he breaks up some of the action and launches a gun battle that eventually draws Earl's attention.  When they find out they are working together against a common enemy led by a guy named Nash (Eric Roberts), they team up to bring them down.  Of course, things aren't that easy.  They are still trying to get over their initial differences which results in the majority of the movie being about Hank and Earl fighting rather than about them chasing the bad guys.  But in the end they find out what the bad guys were trying to steal and steal it from them.  Then they set up a sting to bring them down only to find that some members of the police commission were involved.Nevertheless, they end up saving they day, Hank is reinstated into the police force and Earl is made a policeman.My Comments:I'm not really sure what this movie was.  I mean, it had Martin Lawrence in it so it was probably supposed to be a comedy, but I didn't laugh.  It had a few quasi-action scenes in it, but come on, it's Martin Lawrence and Steve Zahn - you can rule out cool martial arts and fighting scenes.  The only thing that really even made it an action flick was that Martin Lawrence carried around a fully automatic pistol.  It just never seemed to find a niche for what it was trying to be.As for the story, it was pretty bad.  The beginning was actually kind of interesting where Hank gives Earl a hard time then ends up going to jail for it, but the number of coincidences that built up to make the rest of the story work after that were just too much.  And, there were a number of things that were left out of the story until the director wants you to see them that would have changed the whole thing - namely Hank's girlfriend being black.  It probably would have made a difference in his trial if this had been made known, but of course it wasn't.  As for her being upset with him about beating up Earl, heck, I'd beat him up he's so dang annoying.What about the acting?  Well, Steve Zahn should have been the first billed for this film because he was the only person that really did anything and was remotely convincing.  Martin Lawrence was just Martin Lawrence - a black man with a grudge who can only be funny by being crude.  Steve Zahn, on the other hand, played a pretty good frustrated cop.  There weren't any real other characters in the movie, so I'm not going to bother to comment on them.Overall, I wouldn't recommend this movie.  Maybe Martin Lawrence fans would like it, but it was pretty dry.  Steve Zahn was okay, but considering that he had to deal with Martin Lawrence and a pretty pathetic story, he didn't have a chance.  Don't see this movie.  It's not funny; it's not interesting; it's not even exciting.",1,"Slow, boring, not funny",1060905600,"08 15, 2003",2003,3698,"['Summary', 'Earl', 'Montgomery', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', 'wannabe', 'cop', 'attitude', 'keeping', 'getting', 'pretty', 'much', 'anywhere', 'life', 'Hank', 'Rafferty', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'other', 'hand', 'used', 'be', 'cop', 'being', 'bit', 'emotionally', 'unstable', 'partner', 'was', 'killed', 'accused', 'roughing', 'up', 'Earl', 'up', 'convicted', 'police', 'brutality', 'being', 'sent', 'jail.Six', 'months', 'later', 'Hank', 'out', 'jail', 'only', 'job', 'can', 'get', 'National', 'Security', 'security', 'guard', 'Ironically', 'Earl', 'who', 'flunked', 'police', 'academy', 'also', 'working', 'same', 'company', 'having', 'had', 'so', 'many', 'problems', 'Hank', 'still', 'determined', 'get', 'guys', 'killed', 'partner', 'essence', 'ruined', 'life', 'When', 'similar', 'heist', 'going', 'warehouse', 'where', 'heist', 'taking', 'place', 'only', 'find', 'Earl', 'supposed', 'be', 'security', 'guard', 'duty', 'upstairs', 'having', 'sex', 'woman', 'supposedly', 'secretary', 'Hank', 'arrives', 'scene', 'up', 'action', 'gun', 'battle', 'eventually', 'Earl', 'attention', 'When', 'find', 'are', 'working', 'together', 'common', 'enemy', 'led', 'guy', 'named', 'Nash', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'team', 'up', 'bring', 'down', 'course', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'easy', 'are', 'still', 'trying', 'get', 'over', 'initial', 'differences', 'results', 'majority', 'movie', 'being', 'Hank', 'Earl', 'fighting', 'rather', 'chasing', 'bad', 'guys', 'end', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'bad', 'guys', 'were', 'trying', 'steal', 'steal', 'Then', 'set', 'up', 'sting', 'bring', 'down', 'only', 'find', 'members', 'police', 'commission', 'were', 'involved.Nevertheless', 'end', 'up', 'saving', 'day', 'Hank', 'reinstated', 'police', 'force', 'Earl', 'made', 'policeman.My', 'Comments', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'mean', 'had', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', 'was', 'probably', 'supposed', 'be', 'comedy', 'did', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'had', 'few', 'quasi-action', 'scenes', 'come', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'can', 'rule', 'out', 'cool', 'martial', 'arts', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'only', 'thing', 'really', 'even', 'made', 'action', 'flick', 'was', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', 'carried', 'fully', 'automatic', 'pistol', 'just', 'never', 'seemed', 'find', 'niche', 'what', 'was', 'trying', 'be.As', 'story', 'was', 'pretty', 'bad', 'beginning', 'was', 'actually', 'kind', 'interesting', 'where', 'Hank', 'Earl', 'hard', 'time', 'then', 'up', 'going', 'jail', 'number', 'coincidences', 'built', 'up', 'make', 'rest', 'story', 'work', 'were', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'were', 'number', 'things', 'were', 'left', 'story', 'director', 'see', 'would', 'have', 'changed', 'whole', 'thing', 'namely', 'Hank', 'girlfriend', 'being', 'black', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'difference', 'trial', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'known', 'course', 'was', ""n't"", 'being', 'upset', 'beating', 'up', 'Earl', 'heck', ""'d"", 'beat', 'up', 'so', 'dang', 'acting', 'Well', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'first', 'billed', 'film', 'was', 'only', 'person', 'really', 'did', 'anything', 'was', 'remotely', 'convincing', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', 'was', 'just', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', 'black', 'man', 'grudge', 'who', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'funny', 'being', 'crude', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'other', 'hand', 'played', 'pretty', 'good', 'frustrated', 'cop', 'were', ""n't"", 'real', 'other', 'characters', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'bother', 'comment', 'them.Overall', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'Maybe', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', 'fans', 'would', 'like', 'was', 'pretty', 'dry', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'was', 'okay', 'considering', 'had', 'deal', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', 'pretty', 'pathetic', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'chance', 'Do', ""n't"", 'see', 'movie', 'not', 'funny', 'not', 'interesting', 'not', 'even', 'exciting']",National Security

Then imagine that it is recycled every few minutes. National Security is a comedy that is not only unfunny, but is also unoriginal, full with cliches, and downright pointless.The movie centers around Earl Montgomery (Martin Lawrence), a security officer, and Hank Rafferty (Steve Zahn) an ex-police officer who turns security officer after what seems to be a phony Rodney King type beating. Now, this is where the movie starts to go wrong. It takes the typical black/white man stereotype and turns it into a cop movie that dares to enter where no one has gone before- make consistent black jokes from a black guy. Don't get me wrong, I'm not using black in a derogatory way, but merely to point out that these &quot;African-American&quot; or so called black jokes are unfunny and dull.Later, the two somehow stumble upon a plot to take a precious metal-alloy that will make a crooked cop and some other thiefs rich.

And he's none too happy to learn that Rafferty's girlfriend is black too.

748374,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00008WI9O,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","National Security is much funnier than I went in expecting, but I guess I shouldn't be surprised with Martin Lawrence as main character.  He's usually always hilarious and delivers with the laughs once again here.  It's about a cop who loses his partner during a shooting incident and eventually his replacement becomes Martin Lawrence when the two of them find themselves unintentionally teaming up to shoot down the bad guys in a soda factory.This movie is based around fast-paced shooting or car chasing segments that are totally outrageous and far-fetched, but this *is* Hollywood after all.  The humor comes in the way the character of Martin Lawrence and his partner communicate with each other.  They are total opposites in every single conceivable way and yet, they somehow eventually become the perfect partners for a major assignment.National Security isn't the funniest movie out there of course, but for a fairly brief display of comedic value (around 80 minutes long and that's it) it's pretty satisfying.  I especially like the bumblebee scene which leads to a beat down and speculation of sorts, and the cop who tries to take control during a critical situation by forcing a woman out of her car but ends up having to deal with the woman taking exception to being forced out so he ends up riding in the back seat instead!

748376,A2HP9COIPKXQ1I,B00008WI9O,"B-MAN ""B""","[3, 4]","Well, the problem is that Martin Lawrence is worthy of a much better script.  One might also expect something better from the Director of such hits as Big Daddy & Happy Gilmore, even Problem Child! This is actor/director Dennis Dugan's first film since 2001's Saving Silverman (also featuring Zahn), which wasn't very good but did have some funny moments.  National Security has its moments too, but there are too few.  Still, I don't blame the Director, the fault is in the writing.  When I found out that the guys that wrote ""I Spy"" & ""Serving Sara"" wrote this, it started making sense. Martin Lawrence (also exec producer, whatever that means) seems to be doing a lot of cop comedies - Bad Boys, Big Momma's House (he's FBI in that), and Blue Streak, not to mention Bad Boys 2 and Blue Streak 2 coming soon!  Seriously.  Granted each of those roles has a twist, but here he is once again in a similar role playing a security guard/cop wanna be in National Security.  I'm a big Martin Lawrence fan, but National Security just wasn't very good in comparison to those other films.  The major weak spot is the running racial jokes (""DWB = driving while black"", ""Even the light is white!"", ""I'm against interracial relationships, when the man is white."", blah blah blah).  Actually by the time that last line came, the theatre audience I was with on opening night was dead silent.  The fact that Martin's character acts like he doesn't like white people is hammered in to the viewers head and anything that might be funny about this is drained out about half way into the film.  There are also stereotypes of black people, a lot of them played out through Lawrence's character and others like the woman who Zahn's character orders to get out of her car and then the she slaps him like 3 times and goes crazy.  How many times have you seen this in a movie? Lawrence's other films are strong because they can appeal to anyone and racial humor is all but non-existent.  This film in no way measures up to his other films in laughs.  There are funny parts, actually very funny parts, but they're almost eclipsed by the continuous ""joke"" that must remind us every 5-10 minutes that ""by the way, Martin's character hates whitey!  ha, ha, ha!""  Oh yeah, I liked how they had to ""justify"" the white cop and show he wasn't a racist by giving him a black girlfriend (Did they actually ever kiss each other? and if she loved him, wouldn't she know he didn't lie about beating Martin's character? Guess not.)  Also the only cop of high rank who wasn't crooked was the black cop, nice touch.  This movie doesn't just casuaully use racism as a source of humor...it's obsessed with racism.  Its like the writers just ran out of ideas and said what could we make Martin's character like...I know, he can dislike white people and mention it every 5 minutes!  This is the last kind of movie this country needs right now.  If its point was to show how stupid racism is, that would be different, but instead it just treads the same territory and uses the same old tired racial ""jokes"" & stereotypes that have been done to death.

But compared to his other movie of 2003 (that would be the shockingly awful Bad Boys II), National Security is a rather easy-going and light-hearted cop comedy flick with quite a few good laughs. A lot of them, surprisingly, coming from Lawrence himself.Hank Rafferty (Steve Zahn)is a cop who is unfairly thrown in jail for apparently beating a black suspect (Lawrence) who just got kicked out of Police Academy. With his career in tatters he emerges from the slammer with only one job opportunity available; a lowly guard for a lowly security company. Determined to follow up on the big case he was involved with before serving time, he crosses the path of fellow security guard Earl Montgomery (Lawrence again) and the two reignite their old conflict.The old love/hate buddy thing may be old and the plot may be silly but it's a great excuse for loads of action set-pieces and humor. The potentially dangerous comedy of black vs white never becomes offensive and is handled with such lightness that it never becomes an issue. Both men have their failings and bonuses and are as equal as each other. You really do feel a great partnership between them despite their arguing and fights.Give National Treasure a try. It's slick and fast-moving and is a helluva lot better than Bad Boys II. You'll probably be surprised at how funny Martin Lawrence is. I was.The DVD is in great looking 1.85:1 widescreen with pretty good Dolby 5.1 sound. The scenes where Lawrence uses his automatic pistol really pack a heavy punch in the .1 LFE channel.

Color me surprised, then, when it turned out not only to to be a buddy, cop, action, comedy movie, but an engaging buddy, cop, action comedy movie with some weight to it.Taking its cue from Rodney King, the film shows honest cop Hank having his career ruined when he is videotaped helping a black cop-wannabe, Earl Montgomery, avoid a bee sting. Naturally, he looks like he is beating Montgomery, who does little to help him when questioned by authorities. Railroaded into prison, and then forced to take a job as a security guard, Hank works to solve a very personal case on his own time. Naturally, he is forced to team up with Montgomery, also a National Security company employee. Along the way, there are lots of stunts, shootouts, and action when the bad guys try to stop Hank from solving the case.The film had some good moments of drama as well, from the opening sequence, to Hank's admission of what he saw and how it affected him, and why he wants the bad guys to pay. I also liked the way it turns the ""bad cop"" and ""racist cop"" sterotypes on their head. I had to wonder if Hollywood has started to lean away from the PC, lock-step, hard left, traditional view of race relations (what with recent films like ""Barbershop"" and ""National Security""), in favor of a more honest and realistic view of the issues.The film was nicely compact, tightly designed, directed, and scripted. And did I mention it was funny? The disasters that face Hank, and then both Hank and his ersatz partner Montgomery, are right on the money when it comes to laughs. Martin Lawrence reigned in his more annoying qualities as Montgomery, while Steven Zahn was a pleasant surprise as the put-upon police officer Hank.I wouldn't say that ""National Security"" was groundbreaking cinema or anything, but I really had a good time watching it, and I think you will too.",4,Better than expected...,1043020800,"01 20, 2003",2003,2010,"['saw', 'previews', 'one', 'thought', 'worst', 'would', 'buddy', 'cop', 'action', 'comedy', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'way', 'burn', 'hour', 'half', 'Color', 'surprised', 'then', 'when', 'turned', 'out', 'not', 'only', 'be', 'buddy', 'cop', 'action', 'comedy', 'movie', 'engaging', 'buddy', 'cop', 'action', 'comedy', 'movie', 'weight', 'it.Taking', 'cue', 'Rodney', 'King', 'film', 'honest', 'cop', 'Hank', 'having', 'career', 'ruined', 'when', 'videotaped', 'helping', 'black', 'cop-wannabe', 'Earl', 'Montgomery', 'bee', 'sting', 'Naturally', 'beating', 'Montgomery', 'who', 'little', 'help', 'when', 'questioned', 'authorities', 'Railroaded', 'prison', 'then', 'forced', 'take', 'job', 'security', 'guard', 'Hank', 'solve', 'very', 'personal', 'case', 'own', 'time', 'Naturally', 'forced', 'team', 'up', 'Montgomery', 'also', 'National', 'Security', 'company', 'employee', 'way', 'are', 'lots', 'stunts', 'shootouts', 'action', 'when', 'bad', 'guys', 'try', 'stop', 'Hank', 'solving', 'case.The', 'film', 'had', 'good', 'moments', 'drama', 'well', 'opening', 'sequence', 'Hank', 'admission', 'what', 'saw', 'how', 'affected', 'why', 'bad', 'guys', 'pay', 'also', 'liked', 'way', 'bad', 'cop', 'racist', 'cop', 'sterotypes', 'head', 'had', 'wonder', 'Hollywood', 'started', 'lean', 'away', 'PC', 'lock-step', 'hard', 'left', 'traditional', 'view', 'race', 'relations', 'what', 'recent', 'films', 'Barbershop', 'National', 'Security', 'favor', 'more', 'honest', 'realistic', 'view', 'issues.The', 'film', 'was', 'nicely', 'compact', 'tightly', 'designed', 'directed', 'scripted', 'did', 'mention', 'was', 'funny', 'disasters', 'face', 'Hank', 'then', 'Hank', 'ersatz', 'partner', 'Montgomery', 'are', 'right', 'money', 'when', 'laughs', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', 'reigned', 'more', 'annoying', 'qualities', 'Montgomery', 'Steven', 'Zahn', 'was', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'put-upon', 'police', 'officer', 'Hank.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'National', 'Security', 'was', 'groundbreaking', 'cinema', 'anything', 'really', 'had', 'good', 'time', 'watching', 'think', 'will', 'too']",National Security

Add to that the comedy action genre that proved more than successful with films like Bad Boys and I Spy, and I was expecting to spend a good entertainng hour and a half.How disappointed I was: it was one of the very few films that had I watched it in a theatre, I would made my excuses and fled, whereas thanks to my fast forward key on my DVD remote, which I had to use several times, the agony of boredom was minimized.The problem with National Security is not the acting. All actors are good, even including Eric Roberts who was terribly miscat for this yet another baddie role. I rather blame the plot, script and directing.An example of how bad the script is, is in a scene when Zahn, a policeman is prosecuted for an alledged beating of Lawrence.(he was instead trying ot kill a wasp!?! is this not remotely funny or what?).He gets six months in jail, and the next second he comes out and works for a security firm.He then by chance meets Lawrence again (who happens to help prosecute him and was in court for the trial) and he tells him he got six months because of him. Lawrence is shocked and asks: six months only??And it gets only worse after that.Moreover I think the writers were pretty confused about Lawrence's character, as we are first introduced to him as this inexplicably over the top unstable man. In addition to that the film is full of over stretched cliches about Caucasians and African-Americans.Trust me this film is pretty bad, and waste of time for really talented actors, and a proof that a movie to succeed it is imperative that it should have the right good combination of acting, directing and script..remove one and you will end up with a big flop!",1,A Mess,1062460800,"09 2, 2003",2003,1846,"['was', 'looking', 'forward', 'watch', 'National', 'Security', 'only', 'pairing', 'two', 'very', 'funny', 'talented', 'actors', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'can', 'surely', 'be', 'hit', 'Add', 'comedy', 'action', 'genre', 'proved', 'more', 'successful', 'films', 'Bad', 'Boys', 'Spy', 'was', 'expecting', 'spend', 'good', 'entertainng', 'hour', 'half.How', 'disappointed', 'was', 'was', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'films', 'had', 'watched', 'theatre', 'would', 'made', 'excuses', 'fled', 'whereas', 'thanks', 'fast', 'forward', 'key', 'DVD', 'remote', 'had', 'use', 'several', 'times', 'agony', 'boredom', 'was', 'minimized.The', 'problem', 'National', 'Security', 'not', 'acting', 'actors', 'are', 'good', 'even', 'including', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'who', 'was', 'terribly', 'miscat', 'yet', 'baddie', 'role', 'rather', 'blame', 'plot', 'script', 'directing.An', 'example', 'how', 'bad', 'script', 'scene', 'when', 'Zahn', 'policeman', 'prosecuted', 'alledged', 'beating', 'Lawrence', 'was', 'instead', 'trying', 'ot', 'kill', 'wasp', 'not', 'remotely', 'funny', 'what', '.He', 'six', 'months', 'jail', 'next', 'second', 'out', 'security', 'firm.He', 'then', 'chance', 'meets', 'Lawrence', 'again', 'who', 'help', 'prosecute', 'was', 'court', 'trial', 'got', 'six', 'months', 'Lawrence', 'shocked', 'asks', 'six', 'months', 'only', 'only', 'worse', 'that.Moreover', 'think', 'writers', 'were', 'pretty', 'confused', 'Lawrence', 'character', 'are', 'first', 'introduced', 'inexplicably', 'top', 'unstable', 'man', 'addition', 'film', 'full', 'stretched', 'cliches', 'Caucasians', 'African-Americans.Trust', 'film', 'pretty', 'bad', 'waste', 'time', 'really', 'talented', 'actors', 'proof', 'movie', 'succeed', 'imperative', 'should', 'have', 'right', 'good', 'combination', 'acting', 'directing', 'script..remove', 'one', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'big', 'flop']",National Security

Earl Montgomery (Martin Lawrence) is a cop wannabe with a ""white man holding down the brother"" attitude who's too much of a loose cannon to get on the force and is thus reduced to being a security guard.  After a minor altercation between Hank and Earl that gets blown to Rodney King proportions Hank is out of a job and in jail.  After serving his time Hank is reduced to becoming a security guard.  Following the trail of the men who murdered his partner, Hank finds that he must now team up with the man who put him in jail to stop a smuggling ring and avenge his fallen partner.THE COOL THINGS:Overall, the story is somewhat, neigh, VERY predictable but is filled with some decent action and some decent comedy.  That's about it though...THE CRITICAL ANALYSIS:Like in most of his movies, Martin Lawrence's comedy is clearly the driving force behind the film.  Unfortunately in this particular flick they lost quite a few steps.  Earl's ""White Man out to get the brother"" shtick wears thin VERY quickly and the character becomes pretty annoying after a while.  The tension between the two characters is played out very well and Earl does get his comeuppance but Earl's character is easily more of an annoyance to the viewer rather than the fun guilty pleasure most Lawrence characters usually are.BEST SCENES:No real best scenes in this film.  Everything is basically one huge joke as Hank and Earl work they way around.THE DVD EXTRAS:As far as DVDs go, this one is pretty sparse with the only things of note being the requisite commentary track and the alternate ending.  Here's what you get:1. Director's Audio Commentary Track - decent as always2. 2 Deleted Scenes - pretty much rubbish stuff3. Alternate Ending - decent alternate ending that could have worked4. Music Video - some rap song by some rappers, ehhh5. Trailers for National Security, Bad Boys II and Charlie's Angels:  Full ThrottleTHE VERDICT:Well, yet another Martin Lawrence buddy cop comedy.  Some things worked here, some things didn't.  This was easily the worst of his efforts.  While the basic plot of the film worked the Earl character was just a bit too much.  Again, some nice subtle potshots about racial relations usually work best but Earl's character was just way too much.  While the movie had some pretty funny stuff comedy wise and some decent action, Lawrence's character more annoying than funny.The DVD extras are almost non-existant so you don't get that much value for your buck here other than the movie itself and handful of extras.THE GRADES:The Move:  2 starsThe Extras:  3 starsOverall:  2.5 starsThere's some decent action with some funny stuff if you can stand Earl's mouth.Mild Recommendation:  Stick with Blue Streak or Bad Boys",3,Damn Gina&#65533;,1060560000,"08 11, 2003",2003,2928,"['National', 'Security', 'yet', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', 'buddy', 'cop', 'comedy', 'little', 'short', 'previous', 'work.THE', 'STORY', 'Hank', 'Rafferty', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'cop', 'partner', 'got', 'killed', 'job', 'Earl', 'Montgomery', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', 'cop', 'wannabe', 'white', 'man', 'holding', 'down', 'brother', 'attitude', 'who', 'too', 'much', 'loose', 'cannon', 'get', 'force', 'thus', 'reduced', 'being', 'security', 'guard', 'minor', 'altercation', 'Hank', 'Earl', 'blown', 'Rodney', 'King', 'proportions', 'Hank', 'job', 'jail', 'serving', 'time', 'Hank', 'reduced', 'becoming', 'security', 'guard', 'Following', 'trail', 'men', 'who', 'murdered', 'partner', 'Hank', 'must', 'now', 'team', 'up', 'man', 'who', 'put', 'jail', 'stop', 'smuggling', 'ring', 'avenge', 'fallen', 'partner.THE', 'COOL', 'THINGS', 'Overall', 'story', 'somewhat', 'neigh', 'VERY', 'predictable', 'filled', 'decent', 'action', 'decent', 'comedy', 'CRITICAL', 'ANALYSIS', 'most', 'movies', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', 'comedy', 'clearly', 'driving', 'force', 'film', 'Unfortunately', 'particular', 'flick', 'lost', 'quite', 'few', 'steps', 'Earl', 'White', 'Man', 'out', 'get', 'brother', 'shtick', 'wears', 'thin', 'VERY', 'quickly', 'character', 'pretty', 'annoying', 'while', 'tension', 'two', 'characters', 'played', 'out', 'very', 'well', 'Earl', 'get', 'comeuppance', 'Earl', 'character', 'easily', 'more', 'annoyance', 'viewer', 'rather', 'fun', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'most', 'Lawrence', 'characters', 'usually', 'are.BEST', 'SCENES', 'real', 'best', 'scenes', 'film', 'Everything', 'basically', 'one', 'huge', 'joke', 'Hank', 'Earl', 'work', 'way', 'around.THE', 'DVD', 'EXTRAS', 'As', 'far', 'DVDs', 'go', 'one', 'pretty', 'sparse', 'only', 'things', 'note', 'being', 'requisite', 'commentary', 'track', 'alternate', 'ending', 'Here', 'what', 'get:1', 'Director', 'Audio', 'Commentary', 'Track', 'decent', 'always2', '2', 'Deleted', 'Scenes', 'pretty', 'much', 'rubbish', 'stuff3', 'Alternate', 'Ending', 'decent', 'alternate', 'ending', 'could', 'have', 'worked4', 'Music', 'Video', 'rap', 'song', 'rappers', 'ehhh5', 'Trailers', 'National', 'Security', 'Bad', 'Boys', 'II', 'Charlie', 'Angels', 'Full', 'ThrottleTHE', 'VERDICT', 'Well', 'yet', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', 'buddy', 'cop', 'comedy', 'things', 'worked', 'here', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'was', 'easily', 'worst', 'efforts', 'basic', 'plot', 'film', 'worked', 'Earl', 'character', 'was', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'Again', 'nice', 'subtle', 'potshots', 'racial', 'relations', 'usually', 'work', 'best', 'Earl', 'character', 'was', 'just', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'movie', 'had', 'pretty', 'funny', 'stuff', 'comedy', 'wise', 'decent', 'action', 'Lawrence', 'character', 'more', 'annoying', 'funny.The', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'almost', 'non-existant', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'that', 'much', 'value', 'buck', 'here', 'other', 'movie', 'handful', 'extras.THE', 'GRADES', 'Move', '2', 'starsThe', 'Extras', '3', 'starsOverall', '2.5', 'decent', 'action', 'funny', 'stuff', 'can', 'stand', 'Earl', 'mouth.Mild', 'Recommendation', 'Stick', 'Blue', 'Streak', 'Bad', 'Boys']",National Security

Martin plays the same thing as he does in just about every single other movie he's in...a cop. Well, not at first, he isn't. At first, he plays a rejected LAPD trainee who just got booted. Cracky and upset, he makes his way back to his car, when he realizes he left his keys inside. He reaches his hand in the half open window, making it appear he's trying to [take] the car, so a cop stops to talk to him. That's when the ""because I'm black"" lines start. I won't reveal what happens between the two, because that's a main part in the movie, but anyway, the cop is cranky as well because his partner was recently killed. The movie's a normal length, about an hour and a half, but in some parts you feel like you've just got done seeing The Two Towers. Corny and unbelievable, you can't go to see this movie with hopes of ""Dr. No"", not that anyone does, but this Lawrence movie does have an unusaully high action level.Go see this sometime.

When Earl accidentally locks his keys in the car, he looks quite suspicious to Anglo cop Hank, and Hank decides to stop and ask him a few questions. Earl mouths off, and then panics when a bumblebee tries to sting him. A tourist catches the incident on film, and poor Hank is sent to the slammer.I actually LIKED National Security, the acting was well done, some of the gags were humorous, and the dynamic between Earl and Hank was funny.The downside: At times the racist bile spewed by Earl went a bit too far. I also found the Earl character a bit difficult to like. He was bigoted, emotionally needy, craving Hank's approval, and  at the same time rejecting him because he was white.  The sad thing was, this behavior is constantly being rewarded. This left me with a vaguely unsatisfied feeling. I would've liked to see  Hank and Earl learn to respect each other, and for Earl to apologize for not being honest at the trial and for Hanks' incarceration. Moreover, I guess, I would've liked to have simply LIKED Earl, and for Earl to be more engaging.Overall, if you can overlook the scenes of non-stop racial humor, I found this to be a funny flick.",4,I actually liked it....

National Security is a title that five years ago would of been R for language. Today it is PG-13.The story behind National Security is that Martin Lawrence is training to be part of the LAPD. However with that mouth of his and recklessness he never passes training. Steve Zahn is a cop who just lost his partner in a shoot out. Martin Lawrence one day accidentally locks his keys in his car and is trying to reach in to open up his car. Zahn shows up thinking Lawrence is trying to steal the car. LAwrence starts throwing his mouth and eventually Zahn trys to arrest him, a little more forcefully but still trying to arrest him. Then a Bee shows up which Lawrence is allregic to. Zahn trys to swat it as Lawrence is screaming like a school girl and a family get this all on tape. Zahn is arrested and goes to jail for 6 months. WHen he gets out he becomes a security guard. From there he inadvertadly ends up working with Lawrence and they get tangled in a big crime scheme.The reason this should of been R is language, probably the deciding factor in many films.  LAwrence uses every piece of profanity in the book with this movie and it still ends up with a PG-13 rating.  Overall this movie should of been R or at least found something less colorful for the dialouge.
