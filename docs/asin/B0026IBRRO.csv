1251465,A1EO5YR1238VL3,B0026IBRRO,Christopher Fama,"[1, 2]","I'm reviewing this DVD based on its content, not the fact that its a subset of the complete season to be issued November 3rd, 2009.  The Season is a must buy, but that doesn't mean these DVD's aren't a great sampler for the casual fan or newbee.The Clone Wars is the crowning achievement of the Star Wars franchise, at least as far as I'm concerned.  The stories are better, the acting is better, and the computer animation is simply amazing.  Be warned: there is plenty of violence, and most episodes are easily PG-13.This set contains the Ryloth Trilogy, a war heavy set of stories. There's plenty of space clashes and ground battles - many featuring classic Star Wars vehicles. If you are looking to be astounded by great computer animation, this is a good place to start because the Star Wars folks perfected CGI for things like ships and weapons many many years ago.",5,The Best Star Wars Has Ever Been,1253059200,"09 16, 2009",2009,871,"[""'m"", 'reviewing', 'DVD', 'based', 'content', 'not', 'fact', 'subset', 'complete', 'season', 'be', 'issued', 'November', '3rd', '2009', 'Season', 'must', 'buy', ""n't"", 'mean', 'DVD', 'are', ""n't"", 'great', 'sampler', 'casual', 'fan', 'newbee.The', 'Clone', 'Wars', 'crowning', 'achievement', 'Star', 'Wars', 'franchise', 'least', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'stories', 'are', 'better', 'acting', 'better', 'computer', 'animation', 'simply', 'amazing', 'Be', 'warned', 'plenty', 'violence', 'most', 'episodes', 'are', 'easily', 'PG-13.This', 'set', 'Ryloth', 'Trilogy', 'war', 'heavy', 'set', 'stories', 'plenty', 'space', 'clashes', 'ground', 'battles', 'many', 'featuring', 'classic', 'Star', 'Wars', 'vehicles', 'are', 'looking', 'be', 'astounded', 'great', 'computer', 'animation', 'good', 'place', 'start', 'Star', 'Wars', 'folks', 'perfected', 'CGI', 'things', 'ships', 'weapons', 'many', 'many', 'years', 'ago']",Star Wars: The Clone Wars: V2 (DVD)
