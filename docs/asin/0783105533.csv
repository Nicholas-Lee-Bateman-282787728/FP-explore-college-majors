Anthony Hopkins again shows that his capabilities go beyond that of Hannibal Lectar. In this, he plays &quot;Jack&quot; C.S. Lewis, the author of the Chronicles of Narnia, with deep passion and realism. Not many people know what an interesting life C.S. Lewis led, such as being a best friend and spiritual councelor to J.R.R. Tolkien (Lord of the Rings).This movie centers on the love of Lewis and the easily controlled world in which he has surrounded himself. When Joyce (Debra Winger) writes him a letter, she catches his attention and he agrees to meet with her.Joyce brings with her a young son (Joseph Mazello) that is having to deal with seperation from his abusive, alchoholic father. There is a scene near the end with Hopkins and Mazello that is priceless.Before Lewis meet's Joyce he is a man of solitude and withdrawn emotions, and is surrounded by pieces of his childhood. On his wall next to his desk hangs a painting of what he refers to as heaven. This idea of happiness is kept in the form of the painting, until he searches for it.Shadowland's is a great movie that apparently hasn't been discovered by a large number of people. How unfortunate! This has the qualities of a classic thanks to Richard Attenborough's terrific direction, a great story, and perfect casting. ~s.a.o.s.~",5,Whistler,1020038400,"04 29, 2002",2002,1385,"['Just', 'when', 'think', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'best', 'find', 'movie', 'Shadowlands', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'again', 'capabilities', 'go', 'Hannibal', 'Lectar', 'quot', 'Jack', 'quot', 'C.S', 'Lewis', 'author', 'Chronicles', 'Narnia', 'deep', 'passion', 'realism', 'Not', 'many', 'people', 'know', 'what', 'interesting', 'life', 'C.S', 'Lewis', 'led', 'such', 'being', 'best', 'friend', 'spiritual', 'councelor', 'J.R.R', 'Tolkien', 'Lord', 'Rings', '.This', 'movie', 'centers', 'love', 'Lewis', 'easily', 'controlled', 'world', 'surrounded', 'When', 'Joyce', 'Debra', 'Winger', 'letter', 'attention', 'meet', 'her.Joyce', 'brings', 'young', 'son', 'Joseph', 'Mazello', 'having', 'deal', 'seperation', 'abusive', 'alchoholic', 'father', 'scene', 'end', 'Hopkins', 'Mazello', 'priceless.Before', 'Lewis', 'meet', 'Joyce', 'man', 'solitude', 'withdrawn', 'emotions', 'surrounded', 'pieces', 'childhood', 'wall', 'desk', 'painting', 'what', 'heaven', 'idea', 'happiness', 'kept', 'form', 'painting', 'it.Shadowland', 'great', 'movie', 'apparently', ""n't"", 'been', 'discovered', 'large', 'number', 'people', 'How', 'unfortunate', 'qualities', 'classic', 'thanks', 'Richard', 'Attenborough', 'terrific', 'direction', 'great', 'story', 'perfect', 'casting', '~s.a.o.s.~']",N/A

Still, this compelling and beautifully told story of author C.S. Lewis's love affair with poet Joy Gresham not only stole my attention, but my heart as well.  Soft, tender, heartfelt and completely absorbing, director Richard Attenborough (who apparently LOVES directing biopics) brings so much subtle affection to this film, allowing for the audience to connect on such a deep level.The story of Jack (as C.S. is referred) is a very moving one.  Building a life for himself that revolves around comfort and the absence of pain, Jack is intent on keeping away those who could hurt him.  He finds comfort in the fact that he has never felt the cold sting of suffering in his life, but his life is soon to take a turn he hadn't expected.  When he meets Joy, the change begins.  Joy is a divorced poet who brings her son to see Jack.  Her son is a fan of Jack's Narnia book series, but it is Joy who walks away smitten with Jack.  The feeling was mutual.  Their relationship starts off strictly platonic but starts to shift when Joy is diagnosed with cancer and given a short time to live.  This sends Jack's world into a tailspin.  All the creature comforts he staked his life on are completely obliterated as he finds himself struggling to find answers to the many questions flooding his mind.  His faith in god is struck, and he wonders why a god would allow this pain to exist and this woman to suffer.But, as this beautiful film conveys, suffering allows us to appreciate and love in the first place.The film is anchored by two tremendous performances in Anthony Hopkins (what a killer year he had in 1993) and Debra Winger.  Winger is especially on point as the vivacious Joy, crippled by her impending fate.  She highlights so many layers in this woman and creates such a moving portrayal of love, loss and acceptance.  Hopkins restrains himself perfectly, etching out this man's inner turmoil while never forgetting the fascination he is feeling as his emotions are unveiling.  He captures `falling in love' with such grace.I'm a complete fan of this film.  It is slow moving yet deeply haunting and the message conveyed of the power (and pain) of love, it nearly unmatched.",5,"Without a shadow of a doubt, a fantastic film!",1371168000,"06 14, 2013",2013,2277,"['First', ""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'Lion', 'Witch', 'Wardrobe', ""'ve"", 'never', 'even', 'seen', 'movie', 'Still', 'compelling', 'beautifully', 'told', 'story', 'author', 'C.S', 'Lewis', 'love', 'affair', 'poet', 'Joy', 'Gresham', 'not', 'only', 'stole', 'attention', 'heart', 'well', 'Soft', 'tender', 'heartfelt', 'completely', 'absorbing', 'director', 'Richard', 'Attenborough', 'who', 'apparently', 'LOVES', 'directing', 'biopics', 'so', 'much', 'subtle', 'affection', 'film', 'allowing', 'audience', 'connect', 'deep', 'level.The', 'story', 'Jack', 'C.S', 'referred', 'very', 'moving', 'one', 'Building', 'life', 'comfort', 'absence', 'pain', 'Jack', 'intent', 'keeping', 'away', 'who', 'could', 'hurt', 'comfort', 'fact', 'never', 'felt', 'cold', 'sting', 'suffering', 'life', 'life', 'soon', 'take', 'turn', 'had', ""n't"", 'expected', 'When', 'Joy', 'change', 'Joy', 'divorced', 'poet', 'who', 'son', 'see', 'Jack', 'son', 'fan', 'Jack', 'Narnia', 'book', 'series', 'Joy', 'who', 'walks', 'away', 'smitten', 'Jack', 'feeling', 'was', 'mutual', 'relationship', 'off', 'strictly', 'platonic', 'shift', 'when', 'Joy', 'diagnosed', 'cancer', 'given', 'short', 'time', 'live', 'Jack', 'world', 'tailspin', 'creature', 'staked', 'life', 'are', 'completely', 'obliterated', 'struggling', 'find', 'answers', 'many', 'questions', 'flooding', 'mind', 'faith', 'god', 'struck', 'why', 'god', 'would', 'allow', 'pain', 'exist', 'woman', 'suffer.But', 'beautiful', 'film', 'conveys', 'suffering', 'allows', 'appreciate', 'love', 'first', 'place.The', 'film', 'anchored', 'two', 'tremendous', 'performances', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'what', 'killer', 'year', 'had', '1993', 'Debra', 'Winger', 'Winger', 'especially', 'point', 'vivacious', 'Joy', 'crippled', 'impending', 'fate', 'highlights', 'so', 'many', 'layers', 'woman', 'creates', 'such', 'moving', 'portrayal', 'love', 'loss', 'acceptance', 'perfectly', 'etching', 'out', 'man', 'inner', 'turmoil', 'never', 'forgetting', 'fascination', 'feeling', 'emotions', 'are', 'unveiling', 'falling', 'love', 'such', 'grace.I', ""'m"", 'complete', 'fan', 'film', 'slow', 'moving', 'yet', 'deeply', 'haunting', 'message', 'conveyed', 'power', 'pain', 'love', 'nearly', 'unmatched']",N/A

Lewis, a famous children's writer, is played by Anthony Hopkins, who is absolutely enthralling. He is a man who thinks he can love and be loved, and who can tell others how to love and be loved. In truth, C.S. Lewis would not know love if it smacked him on the head, until, that is, he meets a woman (played by Debra Winger) who changes all he thought he ever knew about life and love. Sounds like an old plot, I know, but this movie touches right to the core of your heart. For the first time in his life, this man's eyes are opened wide, and he is nearly frozen with disbelief and wonder. Debra Winger plays an outstanding role of a divorcee with a small child, who enters C.S. Lewis' life by writing him a letter, and who changes him completely and forever by just being who she is.

He leads an ordered, safe life as an Oxford Don, singing in the cathedral choir and lecturing to audiences of adoring women readers. When he meets American writer, Joy Gresham, her brash, New York, Jewish forthrightness almost batters him but luckily he summons enough courage to begin a friendship. He agrees to marry her so as to allow her and her son to remain in England and gradually she softens his defences and becomes part of his life as a platonic friend. When they discover that Joy is dying from incurable cancer, Lewis realises the depth of his love for her which allows them to enjoy a brief few months together before she dies.

Lewis, the brilliant intellectual, the revered Christian apologist, the man who seemed to have answers to everything, was living a calm and adequate life with his brother Warren.  All of that changed when an American woman named Joy came along.  Suddenly, Lewis (Jack, as he's called) finds he does NOT have the answers, and that there has been something missing from his life all along.  This film is a story of the love that Lewis found, lost, and found again.This movie is well-made, and very accurate as to the period and setting.  Anthony Hopkins's performance is stunning--he seems to fit Lewis perfectly.  I have always had a picture in my mind of how Lewis would look and behave, and Hopkins comes about as close to my mental image as is reasonably possible.That having been said, Debra Winger's acting is absolutely horrid.  Her accent is bad, her mannerisms are annoying, and she is simply not convincing in her role as Lewis's love.  Also, I did not like that the movie ignored such great friends of Lewis's as Owen Barfield and JRR Tolkien (even if these men played a less significant part in his later life).I would have liked to see these men, as well as others, in the movie, but was disappointed.

I must admit: both Anthony Hopkins and Debra Winger make this whole thing come alive.My interest in this began by listening to a talk given by Peter Kreeft on the above book. Mr. Kreeft is a philosopher, a prolific writer, author and speaker who teaches at Boston College. He has a way with words, and after a talk of about 45 minutes (which can be easily found on his website), with the most poignant and touching of quotes from Lewis, I was convinced I must read this book. I felt like I devoured it, although you cannot read it too fast because Lewis forces you to enter into his grief and think though it and grapple with it yourself. It was taken from his own notes which he recorded as he lived this personal tragedy, the experience of losing his wife to this disease. Most definitely, this is a book that approximates the anguish any person would experience upon the death of a beloved spouse. This book is certainly a gift to give to such a grieving purpose.I soon reread the story as an audiobook,A Grief Observed (Library Edition), and found it to be a longer but similarly rewarding experience as was Peter Kreeft's talk. It was from this that I went from this to watching Lewis' and Joy's story portrayed on the screen. That was the progression. Many other reviews supply some of the great quotes that come from Lewis. I simply want to say that I cannot recommend any of these sources too much. It is not something you will tire of. It sort of etches its way into your life and heart.It's a story that can be told at a sorrowful and tearful funeral and produce great effects. It's one of those stories books that seem to have a universal appeal, so much so, that if you are a C. S. Lewis fan or not, if you have not seen the movie, or read the book, or heard of the talk, my advice is to spend some time with them! I do not think you will later consider it a waste of time.

But this film - no surprise - doesn't really deal with that: it's mainly a love story, the love he had toward his American wife, played by Debra Winger.Being a Brit, the film takes place in England and features some wonderful landscapes of that great country. Hopkins exudes warmth in the role of Lewis and Winger is okay, New York City accent and all, as the American. I would have chosen someone else for the role, but Winger gets by.Not to be forgotten is the fine job Edward Hardwicke did as ""Warnie,"" Lewis' brother. Joseph Mazzello, one of the top child actors of the early '90s, is the Lewis' young boy. When father and son cry together at the end, it is one of the most touching scenes I've ever viewed on film.It's a touching story, period, and if it doesn't get your eyes moistened at least once, check your pulse. The dialog in here is excellent, too. I particularly enjoyed the by-play of dry wit between the professors and Winger's various comments to her husband.Nice films like this are unusual and should be treasured, as Lewis and his works are by so many people, Christian or non-Christian.",5,An Extremely Touching Film,1145577600,"04 21, 2006",2006,1526,"['C.', 'S.', 'Lewis', 'making', 'bit', 'comeback', 'Chronicles', 'Narnia', 'movie', 'late', 'here', 'film', 'portrait', 'made', '1993', 'starring', 'great', 'British', 'actor', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins.To', 'Christians', 'Lewis', 'always', 'been', 'familiar', 'name', 'one', 'greatest', 'most', 'well-known', 'Christian', 'apologists', 'theologians', 'Merre', 'Christianity', 'Screwtape', 'Letters', 'etc', 'fiction', 'Narnia', 'series', 'writers', 'time', 'film', 'surprise', ""n't"", 'really', 'deal', 'mainly', 'love', 'story', 'love', 'had', 'American', 'wife', 'played', 'Debra', 'Winger.Being', 'Brit', 'film', 'place', 'England', 'wonderful', 'landscapes', 'great', 'country', 'Hopkins', 'warmth', 'role', 'Lewis', 'Winger', 'okay', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'accent', 'American', 'would', 'have', 'chosen', 'someone', 'else', 'role', 'Winger', 'by.Not', 'be', 'forgotten', 'fine', 'job', 'Edward', 'Hardwicke', 'did', 'Warnie', 'Lewis', 'brother', 'Joseph', 'Mazzello', 'one', 'top', 'child', 'actors', 'early', ""'90s"", 'Lewis', 'young', 'boy', 'When', 'father', 'son', 'cry', 'together', 'end', 'one', 'most', 'touching', 'scenes', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'viewed', 'film.It', 'touching', 'story', 'period', ""n't"", 'get', 'eyes', 'moistened', 'least', 'once', 'check', 'pulse', 'dialog', 'here', 'excellent', 'too', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'by-play', 'dry', 'wit', 'professors', 'Winger', 'various', 'comments', 'husband.Nice', 'films', 'are', 'unusual', 'should', 'be', 'treasured', 'Lewis', 'works', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'Christian', 'non-Christian']",N/A
42174,A28WJUJF6D2ULA,0783105533,Dai-keag-ity,"[9, 10]","As I've written before, American audiences might disagree but I think Anthony Hopkins is far more effective in these sorts of productions than he is in the Hannibal series.Shadowlands is a demanding story that says much in some very small ways that can easily be missed. Telling the (very) true to life tale of C.S. Lewis' marriage, late in his years, to an admiring American poet, Joy Gresham, who visited Lewis and his brother at Oxford, where Lewis, along with Tolkien and some others whose names we remember today, were comfortably ensconced as collegiate dons. While at first the cerebral and emotionally distant (and timid) Lewis is slightly repelled by the extroverted, Jewish Grisham, played here by Debra Winger, Lewis eventually awakens to the realization that a part of his nature theretofore unknown to him has come alive, and the bond he feels for this unexpectedly arrived woman is real and of great meaning to him.While in the beginning Lewis maintains he has married Grisham strictly as a courtesy that allows her to remain in Britain, the amorously inexperienced theologian and fiction writer acknowledges his love, and for a time is the happiest he has ever been. But then a tragedy clouds Lewis' new identity as husband, and also stepfather to a worshipful teenaged boy, as Grisham's dormant cancer returns with fatal results. Lewis stays by his wife to the end, and claims that the lesson he learns from this chapter in his existence is that the sadness that ultimately visits him and all others who love another is part of the joy inherent in love itself, a separate hemisphere, a reaction to an action, the darkness inextricably wedded to love's light. Lewis survives Grisham and goes on to pen more books of a spiritual and ecumenical nature, but as all who have read him or who knew him note, he was a much changed person once Grisham had passed away.Shadowlands somehow handles a dreary subject without losing itself to morosity or melodrama. It is both a movie with a message, and also a visit to the personal life of an intensely private man few who read the Narnia series truly know. It is evenly-paced, intellectually-demanding, and openly spiritual as well as biographical. What it lacks in broad appeal it makes up for in being deeply rewarding to those willing to respect (if not embrace) the lessons Lewis believed he absorbed during the time he was given to know Joy Grisham. Those who didn't find this playing at their local multiplex years ago will be pleased with the quality of this DVD release. I recommend it be viewed without distractions, because its message wilts quite easily.",4,Anyone's Life Might Change,1171670400,"02 17, 2007",2007,2620,"[""'ve"", 'written', 'before', 'American', 'audiences', 'might', 'disagree', 'think', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'far', 'more', 'effective', 'sorts', 'productions', 'Hannibal', 'demanding', 'story', 'much', 'very', 'small', 'ways', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'missed', 'Telling', 'very', 'true', 'life', 'tale', 'C.S', 'Lewis', 'marriage', 'late', 'years', 'admiring', 'American', 'poet', 'Joy', 'Gresham', 'who', 'visited', 'Lewis', 'brother', 'Oxford', 'where', 'Lewis', 'Tolkien', 'others', 'names', 'remember', 'today', 'were', 'comfortably', 'ensconced', 'collegiate', 'dons', 'first', 'cerebral', 'emotionally', 'distant', 'timid', 'Lewis', 'slightly', 'repelled', 'extroverted', 'Jewish', 'Grisham', 'played', 'here', 'Debra', 'Winger', 'Lewis', 'eventually', 'realization', 'part', 'nature', 'theretofore', 'unknown', 'come', 'alive', 'bond', 'unexpectedly', 'arrived', 'woman', 'real', 'great', 'meaning', 'him.While', 'beginning', 'Lewis', 'married', 'Grisham', 'strictly', 'courtesy', 'remain', 'Britain', 'amorously', 'inexperienced', 'theologian', 'fiction', 'writer', 'love', 'time', 'happiest', 'ever', 'been', 'then', 'tragedy', 'clouds', 'Lewis', 'new', 'identity', 'husband', 'also', 'stepfather', 'worshipful', 'teenaged', 'boy', 'Grisham', 'dormant', 'cancer', 'returns', 'fatal', 'results', 'Lewis', 'stays', 'wife', 'end', 'claims', 'lesson', 'chapter', 'existence', 'sadness', 'ultimately', 'others', 'who', 'love', 'part', 'joy', 'inherent', 'love', 'separate', 'hemisphere', 'reaction', 'action', 'darkness', 'inextricably', 'wedded', 'love', 'light', 'Lewis', 'Grisham', 'pen', 'more', 'books', 'spiritual', 'ecumenical', 'nature', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'who', 'knew', 'note', 'was', 'much', 'changed', 'person', 'once', 'Grisham', 'had', 'passed', 'away.Shadowlands', 'somehow', 'dreary', 'subject', 'losing', 'morosity', 'melodrama', 'movie', 'message', 'also', 'visit', 'personal', 'life', 'intensely', 'private', 'man', 'few', 'who', 'read', 'Narnia', 'series', 'truly', 'know', 'evenly-paced', 'intellectually-demanding', 'openly', 'spiritual', 'as', 'well', 'biographical', 'What', 'broad', 'appeal', 'up', 'being', 'deeply', 'rewarding', 'willing', 'respect', 'not', 'embrace', 'lessons', 'Lewis', 'believed', 'absorbed', 'time', 'was', 'given', 'know', 'Joy', 'Grisham', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'playing', 'local', 'multiplex', 'years', 'ago', 'will', 'be', 'pleased', 'quality', 'DVD', 'release', 'recommend', 'be', 'viewed', 'distractions', 'message', 'wilts', 'quite', 'easily']",N/A

That said, once you get past the exterior and get to the meat of this tragic love story you'll be emotionally drawn into each frame.  The true life story of C.S. Lewis (Hopkins) is a beautiful story of love, trust and the ability to allow suffering to appreciate that love and trust.  Jack (as C.S. Lewis is reffered) has built a life of comfort for himself, a life around those who can't hurt him.  He enjoys the fact that he hasn't felt the cold hand of suffering in his lifetime, but after meeting the beautiful and bold Joy Gresham (Debra Winger) all that is about to change.  Joy is a divorced poet who brings her young son to see Jack (beings that he has written the succesfull Narnia franchise) and she immediatly becomes smitten with Jack, as he does her.  Their relationship, strickly platonic, changes as Joy is diagnosed with cancer and given a short time to live.  The remainder of the film is so heartbreaking for it shows Jack realizing how much he loves this woman, and his faith is tested as he wonders why God would allow this to happen.  As Jack soon realizes, it's the suffering now that allowed us the love then...it's a package deal (that's not exactly the way he says it, but it's the general jist).  Anyways, it's a truly wonderful film with brilliant acting on all parts, Winger and Hopkins taking the bulk of the praise.

It does examine his faith more generously and is a bit more factual.Be sure to read two of Lewis' books to accompany this film:  ""Surprised by Joy"" (story of his conversion -- it's not about his wife startling him), and ""A Grief Observed"" which chronicles the crisis of faith he had after her death.",4,"Not quite Jack, but good nonetheless",1041465600,"01 2, 2003",2003,748,"['certainly', 'interpretation', 'Lewis', 'life', 'relationship', 'Joy', 'faith', 'spirituality', 'are', 'downplayed', 'point', 'hurting', 'integrity', 'film', 'raw', 'emotion', 'found', 'version', 'certainly', 'welcome', 'film', 'version', 'also', 'heavily', 'crisis', 'faith', 'suffered', 'Joy', 'death.I', 'can', 'recommend', 'BBC', 'version', 'Joss', 'Ackland', 'Clair', 'Bloom', 'more', 'readily', 'too', 'problems', 'examine', 'faith', 'more', 'generously', 'bit', 'more', 'factual.Be', 'sure', 'read', 'two', 'Lewis', 'books', 'accompany', 'film', 'Surprised', 'Joy', 'story', 'conversion', 'not', 'wife', 'startling', 'Grief', 'Observed', 'crisis', 'faith', 'had', 'death']",N/A

However, for those of us who are devotees of the real C.S. Lewis's theological works, and who know something of his biography, it is tempting to say that this is a fine enough film... but not much about C.S. Lewis.Indeed, the real Lewis and Joy did not have lives that were the stuff of conventional love stories, and the need of film makers to produce love stories in a certain pattern (this one being of the tragic genre) is eternal. Yet their shared Christian commitment, which seems only hinted at in the film, has much to do with their commitment to one another and eventual marriage. With that essential element removed, one tends to shudder that this crude, ill-mannered, loud American woman seems so meddling in the life of an Oxford don. (From Joy's first meeting with Jack, when she calls out &quot;Anyone here called Lewis?&quot; in a crowded , distinguished tea room, I wondered why he did not quietly disappear with his dignity intact.)It seems, considering references to the Narnia series and the fictitious honeymoon spot, that the theme here was supposed to be that love is &quot;magical.&quot; The real Lewis and his wife had less magic but far more substance, much more beautiful in its reality than fairy tales can be.

42194,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,0783105533,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[1, 2]","This is a very strange film, a most extraordinary film. C.S. Lewis and his brother are two unmarried professors in Oxford, living together in the same house. They are living in this haven of peace that Oxford is, entirely dedicated to learning and knowledge, to the maturation of men in the teenagers they get every year, year in and year out. It is their function, their aim, their target and they cannot be derailed from this perspective. Oxford is their own territory and their own world and the world has no limits within these limits of Oxford, and an eventual trip to London for a lecture, but never beyond. C.S. Lewis is a special case in that entirely ghettoized intellectual world. He writes stories for children, for the children he will never have. These stories are about a strange world beyond the bottom of a wardrobe in the attic of his home. A world of bad and evil, of fighting for good and against evil. And yet his life is a routine that would kill thinking out of any human being. But not him, and plenty others around him. They are righteously living in the comfort of academia. The top echelon of that academia. Till one day when an American woman and her young child comes up and asks for an autograph. And the ghetto implodes. The peace is gone, love takes its place. The diplomatic marriage will eventually give way to a real marriage, but on a sick bed in a hospital. She finds out, too late of course, she has bone cancer and will eventually and soon die. And that's how C.S. Lewis discovers there is another love he had never really thought of and certainly not experienced: love for another human being that becomes your horizon and for whom you are dawn and dusk at the same time. That love that makes you mute and talkative in the same minute, so much the one and so much the other that your tongue trips on your muteness and your words get strangled in your talk. Love as a feeling of total gift of yourself to the other and of the other to yourself, with the tremendous responsibility that goes along with it. And death then becomes an unacceptable step away from this reality. Death comes and love will never go away and will turn into suffering, longing, wanting, needing and never getting the satisfaction you could ever wish to get. Love is for life I was going to say, oh yes, love is for life and even beyond life, for death if it comes and when it comes. Love never turns into ashes and never goes back to dirt because it is not dirt, it is the soul of the heart and the mind of life. And that's what C.S. Lewis actually discovers late in his life and never forgot after that. He finally learned how to be a fully blooming man, but it hurts so much when you learn love from within the death of your beloved. I must say the slow rhythm of the film, the very intimates scenes, the delicacy of the language and the acting, and the art of Anthony Hopkins serve that theme so well, so beautifully. It seems to be able to last for ever and ever, and yet the young son, now step-son, is there to remind you the show of life goes on for ever and ever on the stage of the strutting human beings we are.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID",5,"More beautiful than love, alas, you die",1289520000,"11 12, 2010",2010,3267,"['very', 'strange', 'film', 'most', 'extraordinary', 'film', 'C.S', 'Lewis', 'brother', 'are', 'two', 'unmarried', 'professors', 'Oxford', 'living', 'together', 'same', 'house', 'are', 'living', 'haven', 'peace', 'Oxford', 'entirely', 'dedicated', 'learning', 'knowledge', 'maturation', 'men', 'teenagers', 'get', 'year', 'year', 'year', 'out', 'function', 'aim', 'target', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'derailed', 'perspective', 'Oxford', 'own', 'territory', 'own', 'world', 'world', 'limits', 'limits', 'Oxford', 'eventual', 'trip', 'London', 'lecture', 'never', 'C.S', 'Lewis', 'special', 'case', 'entirely', 'ghettoized', 'intellectual', 'world', 'stories', 'children', 'children', 'will', 'never', 'have', 'stories', 'are', 'strange', 'world', 'bottom', 'wardrobe', 'attic', 'home', 'world', 'bad', 'evil', 'fighting', 'good', 'evil', 'yet', 'life', 'routine', 'would', 'kill', 'thinking', 'human', 'being', 'not', 'plenty', 'others', 'are', 'righteously', 'living', 'comfort', 'academia', 'top', 'echelon', 'academia', 'Till', 'one', 'day', 'when', 'American', 'woman', 'young', 'child', 'up', 'asks', 'autograph', 'ghetto', 'implodes', 'peace', 'gone', 'love', 'place', 'diplomatic', 'marriage', 'will', 'eventually', 'give', 'way', 'real', 'marriage', 'sick', 'bed', 'hospital', 'out', 'too', 'late', 'course', 'bone', 'cancer', 'will', 'eventually', 'soon', 'die', 'how', 'C.S', 'Lewis', 'discovers', 'love', 'had', 'never', 'really', 'thought', 'certainly', 'not', 'experienced', 'love', 'human', 'being', 'horizon', 'whom', 'are', 'dawn', 'dusk', 'same', 'time', 'love', 'mute', 'talkative', 'same', 'minute', 'so', 'much', 'one', 'so', 'much', 'other', 'tongue', 'trips', 'muteness', 'words', 'get', 'strangled', 'talk', 'Love', 'feeling', 'total', 'gift', 'other', 'other', 'yourself', 'tremendous', 'responsibility', 'along', 'death', 'then', 'unacceptable', 'step', 'away', 'reality', 'Death', 'love', 'will', 'never', 'go', 'away', 'will', 'turn', 'suffering', 'longing', 'wanting', 'needing', 'never', 'getting', 'satisfaction', 'could', 'ever', 'wish', 'get', 'Love', 'life', 'was', 'going', 'say', 'oh', 'yes', 'love', 'life', 'even', 'life', 'death', 'when', 'Love', 'never', 'ashes', 'never', 'back', 'dirt', 'not', 'dirt', 'soul', 'heart', 'mind', 'life', 'what', 'C.S', 'Lewis', 'actually', 'late', 'life', 'never', 'forgot', 'finally', 'learned', 'how', 'be', 'fully', 'blooming', 'man', 'so', 'much', 'when', 'learn', 'love', 'death', 'beloved', 'must', 'say', 'slow', 'rhythm', 'film', 'very', 'intimates', 'scenes', 'delicacy', 'language', 'acting', 'art', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'serve', 'theme', 'so', 'well', 'so', 'beautifully', 'be', 'able', 'last', 'ever', 'ever', 'yet', 'young', 'son', 'now', 'step-son', 'there', 'remind', 'show', 'life', 'ever', 'ever', 'stage', 'strutting', 'human', 'beings', 'are.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Paris', '8', 'Saint', 'Denis', 'University', 'Paris', '12', 'Cr', 'eacute', 'CEGID']",N/A

He was a soldier in World War 2. His close friend, Charles Williams, died around this period of his life.

42197,A2ZWTFZRNQW7D5,0783105533,Jeremy Storly,"[0, 0]","When I think of Anthony Hopkins, I think of C.S. Lewis.  This is all because of his splendid performance in Richard Attenborough's _Shadowlands_.  Hopkins has long been one of my favorite actors due to his versatility as an actor and his natural, restrained approach to his roles.  Here he is masterful and convincing in his role as ""Jack"" (i.e., C.S. Lewis) to the extent that one almost feels one is becoming acquainted with Lewis himself.Other notable performances include Debra Winger as the uncouth Joy (Lewis' wife), Edward Hardwicke as Lewis' brother Warnie, Joseph Mazzello as Lewis' son Douglas, and John Wood as Lewis' foil and academic cohort Professor Riley.  This is, in my opinion, one of the most well-cast films which, with its minimalism and understated drama, relies heavily on the quality of its performances, which the cast manages to pull off exceptionally well.In addition to its masterful direction and skilled cast, I would be amiss not to mention the excellentsoundtrack by George Fenton, which perfectly complements the mood of the film and the onscreen action.  Immediately during the film's opening credits, the strains of ""Veni Sancte Spiritus"" establish a theme that is developed and sustained throughout the film.  Whether composing his original work, as in ""The Golden Valley"", or adapting a classical piece, such as ""Once in Royal David's City"", Fenton transitions perfectly between pieces that lend to the overall effect of the film.The settings are convincing and quite ""English"", and one can sense the tension between whimsy and corporeality that was the life of C.S. Lewis.  This is especially evident in the wardrobe scene, but also in the recurring theme of the Golden Valley.  Fantasy versus reality, pleasure versus pain are explored in a fresh way that is not sentimental (and if it *is* at times sentimental, well, then so is life).Few films possess such a humble sincerety as _Shadowlands_, and it has been one of my favorites since the first time I saw it.  If you haven't seen it, give it a chance.  Sit down for a quiet two hours and get to know C.S. Lewis.

Lewis came to fall in love, and thereby challenging his deep religious convictions involving pain and suffering.What I found very interesting was that Anthony Hopkins looked a great deal more like J.R.R. Tolkien (who was very close with Lewis: indeed, Tolkien was largely responsible for Lewis' conversion to Christianity) than C.S. Lewis himself. Tolkien was also conspicuously absent. Perhaps it was thought that he was too powerful a figure and would divert the viewers attention from Lewis' story creating an inequality of sorts.However, that has nothing to do with the film.Anthony Hopkins put on a brilliant performance (as always), and when he was describing to his friends the lack of metaphor in The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe, the look on his face was amazing, magical, and beautiful. It was difficult to imagine that was the same face that had played Hannibal Lecter. Paired with Debra Winger, the acting was magnificent.When Debra Winger came to Oxford to meet Lewis for the first time, her nervousness was touching and so well performed. She is easily one of our finest.Watching Lewis slowly realize that he was truly in love with Joy Gresham (Debra Winger) was the focal point of the film and the highlight for me.Also breathtaking was the cinematography.

Especially hard to deal with is the feeling of helplessness in the heart of a man so formerly, and otherwise powerful and emotionally detached. It leads one to the dangerous place where it seems that the promise of true love threatens to be merely a cruel practical joke perpetrated by a God who, strangley enough calls himself &quot;Love.&quot;The story is touching and moving, and ghastly effective in driving the &quot;cruel&quot; point home. For instance:There's always background music in a film. But at this point, the scene is silent. Silent for what seems like an eternity, in a room with only a bed visible. On it lays Lewis' wife, while he kneels with his head laying silently on on the side of her bed. Only the clock can be heard ticking, slowly, endlessly. She's dying, and they both know it. And that's the source of the pain.The dialogue is engaging and heart-breaking at times.  Lewis is left to explain to Joy the seriousness of her condition, and when she finds out:He: &quot;I don't want to lose you...&quot;She: &quot;I don't want to be lost...&quot;The movie is so sad because it's so true - and true not just for Lewis fifty some-odd years ago; but true for all of us, by the thousands every day. Every man and wife, every father and son, every mother and daughter knows that this day is coming for us too, and we are all helpless to avoid it, or to stop it when it comes.This movie's emotional impact will not stop when the credits roll. It will not stop on the way home. It will not stop for DAYS. It's actually been about six years since I viewed the film, and I want to watch it again, but I have been avoiding it because I already know the deep impact it is going to extoll on me in the process.

His heart was ice and his Christian faith provided a comfortable protective shell from being emotionally hurt. Like the chronic winter of Narnia, Lewis was numb and frozen to the sun and warm emotions of love until Joy Gresham entered his life. Then it was all tested as Lewis' emotional snow began to melt. For a committed British Christian, Lewis had to wrestle with Joy's Jewish heritage, divorced status, single motherhood, brash New York manner, and her total opposite character to him.

In this enactment of the romance between Lewis and Joy Gresham, a divorced American with a young son, Hopkins portrays an extremely private man and he does so with great sensitivity.The stolid Oxford professor has insulated himself from any real intimacy with the world. As his friend Joy Gresham says, Lewis keeps everyone at a distance, either by years or by position. Secure in the book-lined rooms of academia, CS Lewis is enshrined in the world of the intellect, recoiling from the pain of real personal investment.When Lewis meets Gresham and her son, the professor makes an elaborate show of friendship unbound by commitment. But Joy (Debra Winger) is more direct, unwilling to endure his self-protective posturing. In order to remain in London, Gresham must marry and Lewis accommodates her request and they wed in a civil ceremony. It is only after she is diagnosed with cancer that Lewis realizes the depth of his feelings for this woman, their time together now severely restricted. Lewis recognizes the rarity of such opportunity, throwing himself into new-found passion in middle age.Hopkins flexes his acting muscles as this stolid, reserved man slowly awakens after a lifetime of self-control, embracing whole-heartedly an affection towards another, suddenly exuberant after years of emotional quietude. Unable to deal with his own grief at Gresham's impending death, Lewis is finally reminded that her son, Douglas, is suffering as well. In one of the most powerful scenes of the movie, Lewis approaches the young boy now in his care, reaching into the deepest reserves of compassion to as they both grieve, the beginning of healing.The cinematography adds to the texture of the movie, verdant green hills, the weight of an Oxford winter, the bustling London streets. Winger is adequate as Gresham, but no match for Hopkins. Winger doesn't shine, simply reflects Hopkins' tour de force performance.

It is the story of CS Lewis, a literary genius, and his improbable encounter with a love that changes his life.  One caution is that this film cannot be watched with dry eyes, it is that powerful and moving.The film catches an established CS Lewis, who at this point has already written several books and is well known.  He is visited by a woman and her son who come over from America.  One of my favorite scenes is of the young boy searching through Lewis's house and finding a big wardrobe; the look of disappointment when he reaches through the coats and hits the solid back is priceless.  An obvious nod to the magical wardrobe in the CS Lewis classic ""The lion, the witch and the wardrobe"".The scenes of the outspoken young American being introduced to the stuffy Oxford colleagues of Lewis depict just what an improbable match this is.  Nonetheless, Lewis falls in love.  The rest of the story needs to be experienced.There are no weak moments on this film.  The acting is first rate throughout and Hopkins is at his best.  The love between them is both believable and truthful, as is the way the relationship brings out feelings Lewis had long shut down.A classic, a true love story.

The film, however, is not a documentary. It is fiction using the names of real, historical people. Once you get beyond that, it is much easier to enjoy it.The most moving theme of the story is how Lewis deals with the problem of pain as he experiences it. When he holds it at arms' length and examines it with scholarly detachment, pain is easy to understand. It is a necessary means God uses to sculpt and shape his creatures. When actually felt, it is mysterious, confusing, and apparently unnecessary. Why do the good suffer and lesser people flourish? Why does the wonderful joy of love have to be tempered with the excruciating pain of loss? While Lewis was able to speak authoritatively about the purpose of pain in his lectures, he was unable to give an answer to his wife's grieving son. All he could do was to cry along with the child.Perhaps one could learn from the story of Job that it's best not to try to give the grieving an explanation for their pain. Like Job, the fictional Lewis could know that God had a reason but that he could not understand it.I recommend the film as a reminder for viewers that oftentimes pain doesn't make sense.

The famed splendor of the English countryside beguiles.  Add to this the spectacular performance of Sir Anthony Hopkins playing revered author/philosopher C.S. Lewis, and you have a stellar movie.Shadowlands is set in the early '50s when Lewis was a middle-aged bachelor.  All is well in his world.  He is a huge success as an author, teacher and speaker.  His life is well ordered to the point of being hum drum, and it is exactly the way he likes it.  He meets an American, Joy Gresham (excellently played by Debra Winger) who turns his life upside down.  Probably for the first time in his life, he does something really foolish.  He marries Joy to give her ""green card"" status.  The marriage is supposed to be ""only technical.""  He lives in Oxford, she in London.  Joy becomes ill, and Lewis realizes the depth of his feeling for her.  Only when she has received a death sentence, does he fully and reluctantly give himself over to his love for her.  When he loses her, his grief and pain devastate him to the point where he actually loses his faith. Joy has tried to prepare him, ""We can't have the happiness of yesterday without the pain of today. That's the deal."" but nothing in Lewis's life has readied him for it.Yes, ""Shadowlands"" is a two-hankie affair, but not in the usual sense.  It is a path and a journey and a reawakening.  Hopkins is so powerful in his role that the viewer sees Lewis as multi-faceted: a shy man, almost nave in many areas, detached but armored with huge intelligence and cosmopolitan skills.  Debra Winger plays off him with a wonderful chemistry.  (I had to wince at her perfect '50s wardrobe.  It was impeccably ""right"" in authenticity, but so terribly unbecoming!) I also much admired Edward Hardwicke who played Lewis' s brother Warnie.  His warmth and genuine kindness set off Hopkins's detachment and shyness.

42237,A3D6TFYRMIV3ZL,0783105533,Themis-Athena,"[73, 75]","""I seem to play men who are sort of imprisoned in themselves,"" Anthony Hopkins comments in an interview included on this movie's DVD.  And although this adequately characterizes a mere fraction of his work, roles like that of butler Stevens in Merchant/Ivory's adaptation of Kazuo Ishiguro's ""Remains of the Day,"" Henry Wilcox in E.M. Forster's ""Howards End"" (also by Merchant/Ivory) and even Thomas Harris's Hannibal Lecter, illustrate Hopkins's minimalist approach to acting, which makes him so uniquely qualified to play emotionally restrained men, locked up behind the walls erected by convention, trauma or madness.  Thus, while bearing little physical resemblance to the real C.S. Lewis, atheist-turned-Christian scholar and bestselling author of the famous ""Narnia Chronicles,"" Hopkins was a natural choice for the role in this movie about Lewis and his wife-to-be, American poet Joy Gresham (Debra Winger).Albeit subtitled ""based on a true story,"" ""Shadowlands"" doesn't purport to recount the couple's relationship in its full complexity - that would take much more than a 2 hours, 15 minutes-long film, if it were accomplishable at all.  On equally strong intellectual footing, Joy Gresham and ""Jack"" Lewis were bound to each other not only by a joint interest in literature and because Joy challenged all assumed bases of Lewis's scholarly life, but also by their personal geneses as convert Christians (he coming from atheism, she from Judaism, at least partly influenced by Lewis's writings).  Obviously for reasons of dramatic streamlining, director Richard Attenborough and screenwriter William Nicholson - who adapted his play for the big screen after having already scripted the 1985 BBC production featuring Joss Acklund and Claire Bloom - chose to cut down on several facts and persons, such Joy Gresham's second son David (who is not mentioned at all), Lewis's 1954 move from Oxford's Magdalen College to similarly-named Magdalene College at Cambridge (likewise not included), the alcoholism of Lewis's brother Warren (""Warnie"") (which is substantially downplayed, as is the abusiveness of Joy's first husband Bill Gresham) and Lewis's complicated friendship with J.R.R. Tolkien (who surprisingly is not at all among the featured Oxford scholars).  Similarly, at least according to some accounts Lewis was not quite the bachelor he is shown to be here, possibly having shared more than tenancy of The Kilns (where he and Warren still lived when he met Joy) with Janie King Moore, 25 years his senior and mother of his college roommate Edward ""Paddy"" Moore, who died in WWI.  With regard to Lewis's and Joy Gresham's relationship itself, the movie espouses the view of some biographers that the couple's April 1956 wedding was merely a marriage of convenience designed to allow Joy to stay in England - and that Lewis only fell in love with her after she had been diagnosed with cancer (although she had evidently been taken with him for a considerably longer time) - but here, too, much remains disputed:  inevitably so, as this goes to the very heart of their romance; a romance, moreover, growing in an environment not exactly encouraging to the baring of one's soul to outsiders.Be that all as it may, however, ""Shadowlands"" is an emotionally and visually stimulating, tremendously powerful production, centering on the recognition that there are only two ways to deal with love:  either to shut it out, thus avoiding pain as much as you're foregoing bliss, or to embrace it, thus also allowing for the sorrow it may bring.  As a boy, Lewis chose the former:  Unable to cope with his mother's death and reconcile it with the idea of a benevolent God, he chose atheism over religion and, later, a scholar's protected, emotionally unchallenging existence over matrimony; this remaining his choice even after having accepted Christianity, now explaining human suffering as ""God's megaphone for shouting at a callous world.""  Yet, all that was called into question when he met Joy who, with her outspoken nature, progressive views, ex-communist background and New York Jewish upbringing was the most unlikely match conceivable for him; and soon made herself unpopular with his Oxford colleagues, e.g. by pointedly rebuking Christopher Riley's (John Wood's) remark that men have intellect where women have souls (which incidentally could well have come from Lewis himself, who had once explained his refusal to marry by noting that then ""all the topics of conversation would be used up in a fortnight"").  Yet, what had started with a courtesy meeting over tea with a self-professed admirer soon blossomed into a stimulating intellectual exchange and, based thereon, friendship - although Lewis still clung to the idea that there was nothing more to their relationship.  Indeed, just *because* Joy was a woman with whom he could have the intellectual exchange he had heretofore only known with men, he could accept her as a friend while keeping her at an emotional distance ... or so he thought.  Only the realization that he would soon be losing her forever (at least, according to this movie's interpretation) cut through his armor.  Still, although he believed he had now understood that happiness and pain are inextricably linked in love, his faith was again profoundly shaken by her death, giving birth to of his most personal works, ""A Grief Observed.""Magnificently framed by its Oxford University background and featuring a tremendous cast, from the two leads to Edward Hardwicke (Warren Lewis), Joseph Mazzello (Douglas Gresham) and top-tier actors even in minor roles (to name but a few, Julian Fellowes, Michael Denison, Peter Howell, Julian Firth and Peter Firth), ""Shadowlands"" received Oscar nominations for Debra Winger and William Nicholson's screenplay (Anthony Hopkins was only nominated for ""The Remains of the Day""), but in a year that also saw strong competition from ""Philadelphia,"" ""Age of Innocence,"" ""Short Cuts"" etc., ultimately lost out to ""Schindler's List"" and ""The Piano"" (Holly Hunter).  Nevertheless, this is a powerful testimony to the love between two truly unusual individuals; one of Oxford-s pre-eminent scholars and the woman who was to him, as he wrote in her epitaph, ""the whole world ... reflected in a single mind.""Also recommended:Through the Shadowlands: The Love Story of C.

42238,A1ICEZXI9PTCN3,0783105533,"""troytron""","[4, 5]","For six years I procrastinated in regard to this film. I knew it was the story of C.S. Lewis and his Joy. Lewis has always been one of my heroes, a brilliant man of faith who was able to weave the seemingly disparate worlds  of intellectualism and magic into one harmonious tapestry. I have always  stood in awe of his ability to answer the still, small voice of his God and  his own freedom of thought. This film is a vignette, really,--a glimpse  into the life of a man who wrote much about love but never allowed himself  to experience it. Part of what the film seems to be saying is that one  really doesn't need to experience intense love to know what it is, to  appreciate it, to long for it, or to even be an authority about it.However,  a soul that is open to love and its attendant joys and sufferings has a  marvelous chance of finding it, if only through offering it. Lewis meets  his match in a brassy but intelligent Joy Gresham. Their spark of love is  undeniable, but their time together all-too-brief. During this time of  awakenings and realizations, Lewis experiences the greatest miracle of  human life in his tender love for Joy. This is a story about the redemptive  power of love in the face of human pain and suffering, the gift humans have  to transform sadness through unbounding love. Anthony Hopkins' performance  is spectacular. he is truly one of the greatest actors of our time. Debra  Winger shines like an emerald in this film. She is every bit as moving and  sublime as Hopkins, and it is our loss that she works so sporadically these  days. Yes, the film is sad, but it is not sentimental in any fashion.  Ultimately, it is affirming.

The movie is beautifully photographed, is acted superbly, and has some wonderful dialogue. The oral wit of Lewis is captured in almost every scene and Anothony Hopkins gives one of the most realistic and moving performances of his career. Richard Attenborough's direction is nearly flawless and SHADOWLANDS sinks any notion that Attenborough was a one-film wonder director (GHANDI).I am a huge fan of C.S. Lewis and enjoyed the film immensely. Non-Christian friends of mine have been moved to tears while watching the film because not only does it capture the essence of true love, but because it is a true story. C.S. Lewis was set to be a lifelong bachelor until he met Joy Gresham. They were in many ways opposites (e.g. nationality, heritage, lifestyle, etc.) and it would seem inconceivable that the two should fall in love. But they did. It was as though God used Lewis and Joy to illustrate His love for us.There were only two parts of the movie that I disliked. I found Debra Winger's performance to be irritating and annoying. There were scenes where she shined and captured the real Joy. However, for most of the film, Winger's Joy seemed fake and unnatural.The other thing I didn't like about the movie is that they cut out one of the Gresham boys. Joy had two boys, not one and the movie acts as though one of the two brothers didn't even exist. It's simpler to tell a story that way, but not necessarily best.Overall, a wonderful film about two very real people who had an amazing love story. It's a film sure to raise emotion, perhaps bring a tear to one's eye and it makes a great date movie.",5,We are living in the shadowlands.,1033257600,"09 29, 2002",2002,1697,"['SHADOWLANDS', 'film', 'based', 'love', 'story', 'C.S', 'Lewis', 'Joy', 'Gresham', 'movie', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'acted', 'superbly', 'wonderful', 'dialogue', 'oral', 'wit', 'Lewis', 'captured', 'almost', 'scene', 'Anothony', 'Hopkins', 'one', 'most', 'realistic', 'moving', 'performances', 'career', 'Richard', 'Attenborough', 'direction', 'nearly', 'flawless', 'SHADOWLANDS', 'sinks', 'notion', 'Attenborough', 'was', 'one-film', 'wonder', 'director', 'GHANDI', '.I', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'C.S', 'Lewis', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'immensely', 'Non-Christian', 'friends', 'mine', 'have', 'been', 'moved', 'tears', 'watching', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'capture', 'essence', 'true', 'love', 'true', 'story', 'C.S', 'Lewis', 'was', 'set', 'be', 'lifelong', 'bachelor', 'met', 'Joy', 'Gresham', 'were', 'many', 'ways', 'opposites', 'e.g', 'nationality', 'heritage', 'lifestyle', 'etc', 'would', 'seem', 'inconceivable', 'two', 'should', 'fall', 'love', 'did', 'was', 'God', 'used', 'Lewis', 'Joy', 'illustrate', 'love', 'us.There', 'were', 'only', 'two', 'parts', 'movie', 'disliked', 'found', 'Debra', 'Winger', 'performance', 'be', 'irritating', 'annoying', 'were', 'scenes', 'where', 'shined', 'captured', 'real', 'Joy', 'However', 'most', 'film', 'Winger', 'Joy', 'seemed', 'fake', 'unnatural.The', 'other', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'cut', 'out', 'one', 'Gresham', 'boys', 'Joy', 'had', 'two', 'boys', 'not', 'one', 'movie', 'one', 'two', 'brothers', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'exist', 'simpler', 'tell', 'story', 'way', 'not', 'necessarily', 'best.Overall', 'wonderful', 'film', 'two', 'very', 'real', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'amazing', 'love', 'story', 'film', 'sure', 'raise', 'emotion', 'perhaps', 'bring', 'tear', 'one', 'eye', 'great', 'date', 'movie']",N/A

And he does so in this charming, piquant and moving story adapted from the true story of author C.S. Lewis and his love affair with American poet Joy Gresham (Debra Winger).Comfortably situated as an Oxford don, living with his brother and protected from any unwanted contact, author ""Jack"" Lewis is content, set in his ways, and gently going through his days, which will never change until their peaceful end. Then he meets Joy Gresham, a brash, outspoken American who first presents herself as an avid fan, and later becomes his close friend.As Jack falls deeply in love, he cannot accept or even realize the depth of his feelings, as he has never had them before. But Joy's brutal battle with a swift-moving cancer that leaves her helpless changes his view of her, himself, his Christianity, which is so important to his being--and at last, himself.Gently charming and tragic without being cloying, this is a gem of a movie, one that should be owned and cherished.",5,A Perfect Movie,1108944000,"02 21, 2005",2005,1209,"['have', 'begun', 'realize', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'older', 'movies', 'am', 'now', 'watching', 'enjoying', 'was', 'genius', 'can', 'get', 'more', 'pathos', 'more', 'sympathy', 'more', 'complete', 'human', 'understanding', 'lift', 'eyebrow', 'just', 'anybody', 'so', 'charming', 'piquant', 'moving', 'story', 'adapted', 'true', 'story', 'author', 'C.S', 'Lewis', 'love', 'affair', 'American', 'poet', 'Joy', 'Gresham', 'Debra', 'Winger', '.Comfortably', 'situated', 'Oxford', 'don', 'living', 'brother', 'protected', 'unwanted', 'contact', 'author', 'Jack', 'Lewis', 'content', 'set', 'ways', 'gently', 'going', 'days', 'will', 'never', 'change', 'peaceful', 'end', 'Then', 'Joy', 'Gresham', 'brash', 'outspoken', 'American', 'who', 'first', 'presents', 'avid', 'fan', 'later', 'close', 'friend.As', 'Jack', 'deeply', 'love', 'can', 'not', 'accept', 'even', 'realize', 'depth', 'feelings', 'never', 'had', 'Joy', 'brutal', 'battle', 'swift-moving', 'cancer', 'helpless', 'view', 'Christianity', 'so', 'important', 'being', 'last', 'himself.Gently', 'charming', 'tragic', 'being', 'cloying', 'gem', 'movie', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'owned', 'cherished']",N/A

I simply A. Do NOT like the Winger character nor do I really care when she dies. Sounds heartless I know, but when an unlikeable character occupies 1/2 of the screen time, it hurts the film. She simply overdoes &quot;being American&quot;. And the New York accent is layed on thicker than the lipstick. B. I simply do not believe the Hopkins character would be overcome with love for Debra Wingers character as-is. I'm not as intelligent as the Hopkins character and even I can see she is unlikeable let alone unloveable. True story, indeed.What I do like about the film is the little bits of wisdom gained along the way. The reason we experience pain, etc. Hopkins had a key line, &quot;Wanting is more desired than having.&quot; Great bits. And Hopkins is of course near flawless, and also the little pup from Jurassic Park turns in a good show.This movie I'm sure would be 5 stars had Emma Thompson from &quot;Howards End&quot; been the leading lady, which by the way that movie isn't much better because while the actors are all superb, the story is pretty much nonexistant... if only we could switch these characters around and insert them into movies more deserving. Such is life. A fair rental at best.The extras are fair/good and the sound and picture transfer I would say are well above average, which makes the movie all the more disappointing.

Safe and secure in his world of intellectual pursuits and spiritual exploration, C.S. Lewis had no interest in worldly love and romance nor did he think that when he agreed to marry divorced Jewish-American poet, Joy Gresham so that she could obtain British residency, that it would go beyond a platonic friendship.  However, slowly Lewis realizes that his comfortable existence is not only one of cerebral isolation but one of emotional loneliness and finds in Gresham both a feisty, intelligent friend and a profoundly brave and uncompromising woman that teaches him that a person's life cannot be measured solely by intellectual accomplishments or other noble pursuits.  Watching Hopkins as Lewis, all stiff-upper-lip English rectitude, flourish into a man who, for the first time, realizes the transfixing power of love, is a lesson in acting.  Winger is no less impressive as Joy Gresham, a proud and strong woman, unwilling to be undone in the face of adversity.  Joy's death scene is one of the most heartbreaking ever committed to celluloid, with an inconsolable Lewis praying for his dear wife's soul.  I can't tell you how that scene affects me.  I'm not one to cry in films but this so beautifully and honestly done, without a trace of melodrama or maudlin excess, that you feel that you are privy to a very personal moment in these two people's lives and I just bawl my eyes out.

42243,AMMEMPM9MPS55,0783105533,www.DavidLRattigan.com,"[7, 8]","Attenborough's gentle film, based on the stage play of the same name, in turn based on the events of Lewis' relationship with (and later, marriage to) Joy Gresham, is a thought-provoking drama that deals with questions that will have faced every person of faith at one time or another. The themes of human experience, the, at times puzzling, antithesis of pain and happiness, and what it means to be authentically human, are lucidly developed without being overdone or becoming cliched.This was the first time in a while I have cried watching a film. In fact, the tears really flowed as I watched the anguish of Anthony Hopkin's brilliant performance. Part of that was the confrontation with the heartache and pain inherent in human existence (at least on this side of eternity); part of it was seeing in Lewis' struggle with the question of pain a reflection of the inner struggle that we all face as we try to hold on to faith in God at times when life seems to be doing all it can to confuse us.
