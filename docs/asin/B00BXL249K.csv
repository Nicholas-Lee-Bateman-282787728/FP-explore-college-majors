1640713,A2FEJIORC1MBG3,B00BXL249K,D. Hartley,"[1, 2]","I'm beginning to worry about Toni Collette. While I realize that she is an actor (and a fine one) who is only playing a seriously unhinged character in P.J. Hogan's ""Mental"", it's just that she's played these seriously unhinged characters so frequently, and with such unflagging gusto, I am starting to wonder if this woman really is off her rocker. And if she is, know that I'm not judging.In this outing, Collette (who made her bones as Hogan's leading lady in his 1994 hit ""Muriel's Wedding"") plays a Nanny from Hell named Shaz (think Mary Poppins meets Courtney Love). She hitchhikes into a New South Wales burg, accompanied by her trusty dog, Ripper. She's picked up by Barry Moochmore (Anthony LaPaglia), an exasperated father of five daughters. He is at wit's end, because his wife Shirley (Rebecca Gibney) who has a history of mental issues, believes that she is Maria von Trapp. Consequently, Barry, an ambitious politician, has sent his wife ""on holiday"" (the laughing house) on the eve of a campaign. What to do about his daughters?For unfathomable reasons beyond the ken of any halfway responsible parent, Barry offers the off-the-wall Shaz a gig as the family nanny. With his wife tucked away under psychiatric observation and his children under possibly psychotic supervision by a total stranger, Barry can now get back on track with his true passions: philandering and politicking. Needless to say, this highly dysfunctional home environment has imbued the Moochmore sisters with assorted neuroses of their own; but as we've learned from similar (and superior) films like Bill Forsyth's ""Housekeeping"" and Eugene Corr's ""Desert Bloom"", it's nothing that the Kooky Free Spirited Auntie can't cure with a few wacky bonding escapades and ""just between us girls"" heart-to-heart sessions.A wild pastiche of general hysteria, screeching actors, busy sets and loud colors, ""Mental"" is a cacophonous, anxiety-inducing assault on the senses. Hogan told an interviewer that the story is loosely autobiographical, that there really was a ""Shaz"" who played a similar role in his childhood. That's nice to know, but why turn such a potentially interesting personal memoir into what amounts to a live action Saturday morning cartoon?  Now that I think about it, it is not unlike a Pedro Almodovar film; except Almodovar seems to know when to put a sock in it and allow his narrative to breathe a bit. While there's something to be said for quirk, ebullience and verve (of which this film certainly has no shortage), Hogan refuses to let viewers up for air, leaving us to drown in his enthusiasm.",2,Mental as anything,1375056000,"07 29, 2013",2013,2596,"[""'m"", 'beginning', 'worry', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'realize', 'actor', 'fine', 'one', 'who', 'only', 'playing', 'seriously', 'unhinged', 'character', 'P.J', 'Hogan', 'Mental', 'just', 'played', 'seriously', 'unhinged', 'characters', 'so', 'frequently', 'such', 'unflagging', 'gusto', 'am', 'starting', 'wonder', 'woman', 'really', 'rocker', 'know', ""'m"", 'not', 'judging.In', 'outing', 'Collette', 'who', 'made', 'bones', 'Hogan', 'leading', 'lady', '1994', 'hit', 'Muriel', 'Wedding', 'Nanny', 'Hell', 'named', 'Shaz', 'think', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'Courtney', 'Love', 'New', 'South', 'Wales', 'burg', 'accompanied', 'trusty', 'dog', 'Ripper', 'picked', 'up', 'Barry', 'Moochmore', 'Anthony', 'LaPaglia', 'exasperated', 'father', 'five', 'daughters', 'wit', 'end', 'wife', 'Shirley', 'Rebecca', 'Gibney', 'who', 'history', 'mental', 'issues', 'Maria', 'von', 'Trapp', 'Consequently', 'Barry', 'ambitious', 'politician', 'sent', 'wife', 'holiday', 'laughing', 'house', 'eve', 'campaign', 'What', 'do', 'daughters', 'unfathomable', 'reasons', 'ken', 'halfway', 'responsible', 'parent', 'Barry', 'off-the-wall', 'Shaz', 'gig', 'family', 'nanny', 'wife', 'tucked', 'away', 'psychiatric', 'observation', 'children', 'possibly', 'psychotic', 'supervision', 'total', 'stranger', 'Barry', 'can', 'now', 'get', 'back', 'track', 'true', 'passions', 'philandering', 'politicking', 'Needless', 'say', 'highly', 'dysfunctional', 'home', 'environment', 'imbued', 'Moochmore', 'sisters', 'assorted', 'neuroses', 'own', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'similar', 'superior', 'films', 'Bill', 'Forsyth', 'Housekeeping', 'Eugene', 'Corr', 'Desert', 'Bloom', 'nothing', 'Kooky', 'Free', 'Spirited', 'Auntie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'cure', 'few', 'wacky', 'bonding', 'escapades', 'just', 'girls', 'heart-to-heart', 'sessions.A', 'wild', 'pastiche', 'general', 'hysteria', 'screeching', 'actors', 'busy', 'sets', 'loud', 'colors', 'Mental', 'cacophonous', 'anxiety-inducing', 'assault', 'senses', 'Hogan', 'told', 'interviewer', 'story', 'loosely', 'autobiographical', 'really', 'was', 'Shaz', 'who', 'played', 'similar', 'role', 'childhood', 'nice', 'know', 'why', 'turn', 'potentially', 'interesting', 'personal', 'memoir', 'what', 'live', 'action', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'cartoon', 'Now', 'think', 'not', 'Pedro', 'Almodovar', 'film', 'Almodovar', 'know', 'when', 'put', 'sock', 'allow', 'narrative', 'breathe', 'bit', 'something', 'be', 'said', 'quirk', 'ebullience', 'verve', 'film', 'certainly', 'shortage', 'Hogan', 'let', 'viewers', 'up', 'air', 'leaving', 'drown', 'enthusiasm']",Mental

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[9, 9]","It's a story too weird to be true -- after his wife is committed to a mental hospital, a neglectful politician hires a hitchhiker to care for his kids.But it actually was true, and it happened to the family of Australian director P. J. Hogan when he was a child. Years later, he sculpted this too-weird-even-for-sitcoms story into a delightfully peculiar, over-the-top comedy with potty humor, musical numbers and the occasional pickled shark. But it has a bittersweet core about loss, disappointment and mental illness.Sweet Shirley Moochmoore (Rebecca Gibney) is treated badly by everybody -- her cheating, neglectful husband Barry (Anthony Lapaglia), her snobby neighbor Nancy (Kerry Fox), her doll-obsessed sister Doris (Caroline Goodall) and even the girls at a local coffee shop. So she eventually has a nervous breakdown, and ends up in a mental institution.Barry demands that his five daughters claim she's ""on holiday in Wollongong,"" mainly because he's up for reelection and doesn't want the bad press. But he quickly discovers that they can't run the house themselves -- especially since all five are convinced that they suffer from various mental illnesses. So he hires a random hitchhiker named Shaz (Toni Collette) to look after them, and goes back to ignoring his family.At first Shaz terrifies the girls, but she quickly converts them to her life philosophy: the ""normal"" world (especially Australia) is insane, and the ""crazy"" unconventional people are normal. She teaches the girls to mess with the bullies in their lives, and even encourages teenage Coral (Lily Sullivan) to pursue her first romance. But what does Shaz have to do with a mysterious shark hunter (Liev Schreiber) and what is her real goal?""Mental"" is one of those ""heartwarming"" comedies that would feel corny if it was just churned out of Hollywood. But since the story comes from someone who actually lived it, it has a very genuine feeling -- especially since it tackles some heavy issues, such as mental illness. Not only does poor Shirley have a nervous breakdown after years of being treated horribly, but one of her daughters suffers from full-blown schizophrenia.And despite that, it's still uproariously funny. Hogan makes the whole thing just a little too colorful, zany and over-the-top. It's a live-action cartoon. He careens us through the over-the-top antics of Shaz and the girls --they trash their neighbor's all-white house in a really gross way, Shaz beats up the donut girls, and attempt a commando-style infiltration of a shark exhibit. But Hogan never loses sight of the bittersweetness of a messed-up family, and never stops making you want to see things turn out all right.If there's a complaint, it's that the movie sometimes doesn't seem to draw a distinction between real mental illness and being beaten down by life. Perhaps that's the point, but that's sort of like saying that Crohn's disease isn't too different from being pressured to go on a diet.Toni Colette is absolutely brilliant as Shaz -- a surly, wild woman with a pitbull and knife in her boot, who never hesitates to kick normalcy in the face. But we get glimpses of a very troubled, sometimes ""mental"" woman underneath it all, and it leaves you wondering if she wants the Moochmore girls to replace something missing in her own life.And the rest of the cast is quite good also -- Sullivan, Bethany Whitmore, Chelsea Bennett and Nicole Freeman are simply delightful as the girls, especially Malorie O'Neill's heartbreaking depiction of a schizophrenic child who isn't getting the help she needs. Gibney is heartbreaking as a sweet, gentle woman who has been beaten down by life, and finally gains some strength on her own. And... well, Liev Schrieber is just hilarious when he's being tortured by an acoustic guitar.""Mental"" is one of those rare comedies that can tackle heavy subjects without losing its wacky, wild attitude -- and Toni Colette's Shaz is worth the price of admission alone.

I finally was desperate for something to watch and so picked &#34;Mental&#34;, while keeping my expectations low.  It grabbed me right away with the opening sequence of this mother and her rendition of The Sound of Music.  The movie was awkwardly funny, plot left you unaware of what was coming next, I laughed until I cried and then the serious moments through me for a loop, cried than too.

Barry, their absentee father (Anthony LaPaglia), is also the mayor of the town. He decides to solve the issue by having Shirley committed and provides for the girls by putting Shaz (Toni Collette) in charge of them. He picked her up hitch hiking.Shaz has her own way of doing things and explains that all of Australia is crazy. Her antics have an ulterior motive which we discover late in the film. Shaz has a refreshing brutal honesty to her approach.The movie is a bit long. The first hour is zany and will have you laughing out loud. The film then shifts into a more serious mode, imitating a dark comedy up to the heart warming ending that brings it home from the opening. Good one P.J.
