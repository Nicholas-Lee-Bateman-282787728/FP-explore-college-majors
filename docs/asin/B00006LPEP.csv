720569,AD2DDHLD6FRFM,B00006LPEP,Brad Baker,"[12, 12]","Frenetic, hard-driving New York lawyer George Simon double charges his wealthy clients,and bails out social mis-casts with his own money.  Avoiding boredom, he dabbles in insider trading. Simon has risen to the top, but a former court case suddenly threatens him with scandal and ruin. Simon is paired with a wife who does not love him; and a secretary who does...Elmer Rice's brilliant Broadway play ""Counsellor at Law"" was purchased for the screen in 1933 by Universal. The studio asked Paul Muni to repeat his leading role.  He declined. They nervously signed John Barrymore; they weren't disappointed. Aided by Melvyn Douglas, Thelma Todd, and Bebe Daniels, Barrymore put aside affectation and delivered a gritty, lightening-paced performance. Never seen on television or video before, ""Counsellor at Law"" has just been released on DVD. Kino Films obtained a sparkling master print, and provided digital restoration. A jump cut in the final reel(hiding possible film damage) is it's only flaw. ""Counsellor at Law"" boasts a photo gallery with 40 rare stills from the director's estate. The film was a watershed event for both director and star.  William Wyler had apprenticed at MGM and Universal since the 20's. His successful direction of ""Counsellor at Law"" propeled his long career, perhaps peaking with 1959's ""Ben Hur"". Star Jack Barrymore was moving in a different orbit.  With shooting on ""Counsellor at Law"" completed, he was asked back for some re-takes. But in shot-after-shot, he could not complete the scene. A new rumor swirled around Hollywood back-lots. John Barrymore's memory had finally faltered.  Despite a classic effort, this was sadly the last A-Picture in which Barrymore received top billing.",5,Hamlet goes to Court,1037145600,"11 13, 2002",2002,1720,"['Frenetic', 'hard-driving', 'New', 'York', 'lawyer', 'George', 'Simon', 'double', 'charges', 'wealthy', 'clients', 'out', 'social', 'mis-casts', 'own', 'money', 'Avoiding', 'boredom', 'insider', 'trading', 'Simon', 'risen', 'top', 'former', 'court', 'case', 'suddenly', 'scandal', 'ruin', 'Simon', 'paired', 'wife', 'who', 'not', 'love', 'secretary', 'who', 'Elmer', 'Rice', 'brilliant', 'Broadway', 'play', 'Counsellor', 'Law', 'was', 'purchased', 'screen', '1933', 'Universal', 'studio', 'asked', 'Paul', 'Muni', 'repeat', 'leading', 'role', 'declined', 'nervously', 'signed', 'John', 'Barrymore', 'were', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'Aided', 'Melvyn', 'Douglas', 'Thelma', 'Todd', 'Bebe', 'Daniels', 'Barrymore', 'put', 'aside', 'affectation', 'delivered', 'gritty', 'lightening-paced', 'performance', 'Never', 'seen', 'television', 'video', 'Counsellor', 'Law', 'just', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'Kino', 'Films', 'obtained', 'sparkling', 'master', 'print', 'provided', 'digital', 'restoration', 'jump', 'cut', 'final', 'reel', 'hiding', 'possible', 'film', 'damage', 'only', 'flaw', 'Counsellor', 'Law', 'photo', 'gallery', '40', 'rare', 'stills', 'director', 'estate', 'film', 'was', 'watershed', 'event', 'director', 'star', 'William', 'Wyler', 'had', 'apprenticed', 'MGM', 'Universal', '20', 'successful', 'direction', 'Counsellor', 'Law', 'propeled', 'long', 'career', 'perhaps', 'peaking', '1959', 'Ben', 'Hur', 'Star', 'Jack', 'Barrymore', 'was', 'moving', 'different', 'orbit', 'shooting', 'Counsellor', 'Law', 'completed', 'was', 'asked', 'back', 're-takes', 'shot-after-shot', 'could', 'not', 'complete', 'scene', 'new', 'rumor', 'swirled', 'Hollywood', 'back-lots', 'John', 'Barrymore', 'memory', 'had', 'finally', 'faltered', 'classic', 'effort', 'was', 'sadly', 'last', 'A-Picture', 'Barrymore', 'received', 'top', 'billing']",N/A

Fells ""Mr. Arliss's Official Biogra...","[31, 32]","At last, one of the major omissions of the video revolution has been rectified with this dvd (and vhs) release of William Wyler's first major directoral effort. And if anybody ever questioned why John Barrymore was so highly regarded in his day, this film will resolve any controversy in Mr. Barrymore's favor.  This release restores a true classic to general circulation (The Movie Channel ran it a few times several years ago.)Universal balked at paying Barrymore's typically huge salary and hired him at the rate of $25,000 per week for a total of two weeks' employment.  Despite fast work by Wyler and Barrymore, (all other non-Barrymore scenes were filmed after the star was off the payroll) more time was needed and Barrymore ended up working one more week.  These terms were a come-down for Barrymore who had enjoyed multiple-film deals with Warners ($200,000 per film, for five films), MGM and RKO only a short time before.John Barrymore had been a star in films since 1914 (well before his ""Hamlet"" in the theater) and was virtually the only film star of his vintage who successfully transitioned to ""talkies.""  But by 1933, years of alcohol abuse were taking their toll on the 51 year old actor and producers began to distrust him.Ironically, no longer offered long term agreements with major studios, this one-shot deal at Universal and another at Columbia in February 1934, (the screwball comedy, ""Twentieth Century"") turned out to be the best two films Barrymore ever made.  Counsellor At Law shows Barrymore as the finest dramatic actor of his generation and launched Wyler on a remarkable career; Twentieth Century (long available on VHS) shows him as the finest farceur of his era and launched Hollywood's cycle of screwball comedies (it didn't hurt the career of director Howard Hawks either).Alas, Barrymore himself would not be a beneficiary of either film and would be reduced to supporting roles by the mid 1930s, ending up spoofing himself on radio right up to his death in 1942.

John Barrymore is the lawyer in the office surrounded by a beautiful secretary (Bebe Daniels), a funny switchboard operator (Thelma Todd), and a glamorous wife (Doris Kenyon).As a pre-code, this film falls flat. There isn't much here that couldn't have been shown in a film made a year or two later which makes it disappointing to someone looking to see scandalous activity.Without any specific aims, this film runs without ever really getting started. It is short and fast paced with dialogue similar in delivery to His Girl Friday, but the witty lines do not make a great story. The cast is very good and carries out his/her role nicely, however, so the film is not a complete waste of time.",3,High Stress Environment,1153267200,"07 19, 2006",2006,791,"['Counsellor', 'Law', 'more', 'peek', 'law', 'office', 'actual', 'film', 'dramatic', 'events', 'John', 'Barrymore', 'lawyer', 'office', 'surrounded', 'beautiful', 'secretary', 'Bebe', 'Daniels', 'funny', 'switchboard', 'operator', 'Thelma', 'Todd', 'glamorous', 'wife', 'Doris', 'Kenyon', '.As', 'pre-code', 'film', 'flat', ""n't"", 'much', 'here', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'shown', 'film', 'made', 'year', 'two', 'later', 'disappointing', 'someone', 'looking', 'see', 'scandalous', 'specific', 'aims', 'film', 'ever', 'really', 'getting', 'started', 'short', 'fast', 'paced', 'dialogue', 'similar', 'delivery', 'Girl', 'Friday', 'witty', 'lines', 'do', 'not', 'make', 'great', 'story', 'cast', 'very', 'good', 'out', 'role', 'nicely', 'however', 'film', 'not', 'complete', 'waste', 'time']",N/A
720585,A3BSS2M2DPPV4T,B00006LPEP,"""scotsladdie""","[4, 4]","An excellent movie, superbly directed by pantheon helmsman William Wyler early in his directorial career. John Barrymore gives one of his finest performances as a Jewish lawyer who works his way to the top of his profession only to have his gentile wife (Doris Kenyon) leave him. At the bustling Manhattan law offices of Simon and Tedesco, highly successful Jewish attorney George Simon, who has risen from the slums of New York, returns to his roots when he bails out Sarah Becker's son Harry, a young Communist who has been brutalised by the police.  Simon's socialite wife, Cora, is embarrassed at Simon's notoriety and of his heritage while Simon's secretary Regina &quot;Rexy&quot; (Bebe Daniels, in her final film of any merit) secretly loves him...The dialogue is crisp and snappy additionally aided by Barrymore's spellbinding deliveries.  The film was noted to have been made in breakneck speed: Barrymore was letter perfect except he kept flubbing one line which took 52 takes.  Paul Muni was originally sought to play the role, but he played the role on stage and didn't want to be typecast a Jew. The film opened to public and critical applause and today, the lightening still crackles through this masterful film.",5,A PRIME JOHN BARRYMORE PERFORMANCE.,1043798400,"01 29, 2003",2003,1226,"['excellent', 'movie', 'superbly', 'directed', 'pantheon', 'helmsman', 'William', 'Wyler', 'early', 'directorial', 'career', 'John', 'Barrymore', 'one', 'finest', 'performances', 'Jewish', 'lawyer', 'who', 'way', 'top', 'profession', 'only', 'have', 'gentile', 'wife', 'Doris', 'Kenyon', 'leave', 'bustling', 'Manhattan', 'law', 'offices', 'Simon', 'Tedesco', 'highly', 'successful', 'Jewish', 'attorney', 'George', 'Simon', 'who', 'risen', 'slums', 'New', 'York', 'roots', 'when', 'out', 'Sarah', 'Becker', 'son', 'Harry', 'young', 'Communist', 'who', 'been', 'brutalised', 'police', 'Simon', 'socialite', 'wife', 'Cora', 'embarrassed', 'Simon', 'notoriety', 'heritage', 'Simon', 'secretary', 'Regina', 'quot', 'Rexy', 'quot', 'Bebe', 'Daniels', 'final', 'film', 'merit', 'secretly', 'dialogue', 'crisp', 'snappy', 'additionally', 'aided', 'Barrymore', 'spellbinding', 'deliveries', 'film', 'was', 'noted', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'breakneck', 'speed', 'Barrymore', 'was', 'letter', 'perfect', 'kept', 'flubbing', 'one', 'line', 'took', '52', 'Paul', 'Muni', 'was', 'originally', 'sought', 'play', 'role', 'played', 'role', 'stage', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'typecast', 'Jew', 'film', 'opened', 'public', 'critical', 'applause', 'today', 'lightening', 'still', 'masterful', 'film']",N/A
720586,AK61LQI92GTCH,B00006LPEP,"Steven Hellerstedt ""SH""","[4, 4]","COUNSELLOR AT LAW is a law story without a courtroom scene and precious little in the way of a plot or set changes.  CAL is an early-talkie character study of attorney George Simon (John Barrymore), a mercurial man with a trophy wife, a doting (and beautiful) secretary, and sharp memories of his steerage origins.  The successful Simon defends the swank and the poor, politicos and revolutionaries.  The swank pay for the pro bono stuff, and Congressmen calling in with hot stock tips - lots of telephones in this movie - help to keep the bank account properly inflated.CAL slices a tumultuous few days in the life of Simon in his plush, modern Empire State Building set of offices filled with the ever present phones, art deco furniture and parqueted doors with gold-embossed shields.  A cast of deftly drawn characters carry out the thin gruel of a plot.  There's a threat of disbarment and marital issues rear an ugly head, secretary Regina `Rexy' Gordon (Bebe Daniels) sighs and tears up now and then, there's even a class warfare theme that peeks out periodically, but nothing grabs the movie and propels it forward.  In lesser hands this would be a fatal problem, but director William Wyler keeps things focused on Barrymore, who's more than up to the task of holding our interest and making us care.The transfer print is in good, not pristine, condition.  It has a number of grainy mites that I didn't find distracting.  Also included on the Kino disk is a series of still photographs of William Wyler, usually on the set, stretching from the nineteen-teens to a photo of Wyler with Bette Davis taken at his seventy-fifth birthday party.",4,Counsellor at Law,1116115200,"05 15, 2005",2005,1645,"['COUNSELLOR', 'AT', 'LAW', 'law', 'story', 'courtroom', 'scene', 'precious', 'little', 'way', 'plot', 'set', 'changes', 'CAL', 'early-talkie', 'character', 'study', 'attorney', 'George', 'Simon', 'John', 'Barrymore', 'mercurial', 'man', 'trophy', 'wife', 'doting', 'beautiful', 'secretary', 'sharp', 'memories', 'steerage', 'origins', 'successful', 'Simon', 'swank', 'poor', 'politicos', 'revolutionaries', 'swank', 'pay', 'pro', 'bono', 'stuff', 'Congressmen', 'calling', 'hot', 'stock', 'tips', 'lots', 'telephones', 'movie', 'help', 'keep', 'bank', 'account', 'properly', 'inflated.CAL', 'slices', 'tumultuous', 'few', 'days', 'life', 'Simon', 'plush', 'modern', 'Empire', 'State', 'Building', 'set', 'offices', 'filled', 'ever', 'present', 'phones', 'art', 'deco', 'furniture', 'parqueted', 'doors', 'gold-embossed', 'shields', 'cast', 'deftly', 'drawn', 'characters', 'carry', 'out', 'thin', 'gruel', 'plot', 'threat', 'disbarment', 'marital', 'issues', 'rear', 'ugly', 'head', 'secretary', 'Regina', 'Rexy', 'Gordon', 'Bebe', 'Daniels', 'sighs', 'up', 'now', 'then', 'even', 'class', 'warfare', 'theme', 'out', 'periodically', 'nothing', 'grabs', 'movie', 'propels', 'forward', 'lesser', 'hands', 'would', 'be', 'fatal', 'problem', 'director', 'William', 'Wyler', 'things', 'focused', 'Barrymore', 'who', 'more', 'up', 'task', 'holding', 'interest', 'making', 'care.The', 'transfer', 'print', 'good', 'not', 'pristine', 'condition', 'number', 'grainy', 'mites', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'distracting', 'Also', 'included', 'Kino', 'disk', 'series', 'still', 'photographs', 'William', 'Wyler', 'usually', 'set', 'stretching', 'nineteen-teens', 'photo', 'Wyler', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'taken', 'seventy-fifth', 'birthday', 'party']",N/A
