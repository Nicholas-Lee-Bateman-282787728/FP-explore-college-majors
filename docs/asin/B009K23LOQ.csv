1597483,A1BDY9HEHOYGBJ,B009K23LOQ,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","On this DVD, we expected to see Fluffy most of the time, but it didn't work out that way. He's mostly the host of this show, and other comedians do the stand up, with one or two short spotlights for Fluffy. The guest comics used some language and adult comedy, so this one isn't suitable for family viewing. Adults would like it fine. Item arrived in excellent shape, and shipping was fast. Would recommend seller and would buy from again.
