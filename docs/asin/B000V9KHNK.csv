First things first, If you are looking for an exploitation movie, this ain't it. There are a couple of fairly brief shower scenes, and a fairly tame scene of sex between two women, but the overall focus was kept on the story itself. I have seen other work by Jag Mundra on the past, and this was probably one of the better ones. Worth a look for sure.

1099821,A35YWA2V4QHOJ3,B000V9KHNK,"D. Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[1, 1]","As B movies go, they don't get much better than this.  The acting is pretty decent and the storyline is actually compelling.  A Russian stripper named Natasha (Algina Lipskis) witnesses a murder.  The Russian mob comes after her, forcing her to pose as an exchange student to get out of the country.She arrives in England, where she lives with a conservative family that has no clue of Natasha's true identity or the ruthless thugs who are after her.  She blends into the small English town as best she can, and she begins to have a significant impact on the village.  She begins to transform the town - for the better.Algina Lipskis is stunning and has a genuine screen presence.  All in all, this was one of the more well-done B movies I've ever seen.  Like most upper echelon B flicks, it doesn't shy away from gratuitous nudity & that's always a good thing!While one would never, ever guess it from the cover, this film ends up being a feel-good movie.  It's about accepting people for who they are, rather than trying to force them into being what we want them to be.  It's the story of a Russian stripper who became the catalyst for an English village becoming a better place to live.

1099825,A2MF0N72JVXDAP,B000V9KHNK,The Phantom,"[1, 1]","First of all this movie is NOT ""unrated"" (at least my copy wasn't, and I doubt that an unrated cut really exists). It's R-rated and pretty standard fare for sexy R-rated films...in fact considerably tamer than some.That's the only reason that I gave it four stars and not five. Not even any full-frontal shots. Big disappointment.However, everything else about this movie is a grand-slam. Great story. Nice nudity and sexiness. Funny. Touching even, at moments. Thrilling and suspenseful. Well-written for the most part and very well-acted.And you, as I, will fall in love with the adorable lead, Algina Lipskis. Absolutely gorgeous, killer body that she doesn't at all mind showing off. And a really good little actress with good comedic timing. I'm going to try to find more films with her in them.Not truly an example of soft-core fare--a half-step backwards from true erotic thriller territory--but worth viewing and even, I dare say, worth buying.",4,"Very, very good",1255478400,"10 14, 2009",2009,952,"['First', 'movie', 'NOT', 'unrated', 'least', 'copy', 'was', ""n't"", 'doubt', 'unrated', 'cut', 'really', 'R-rated', 'pretty', 'standard', 'fare', 'sexy', 'R-rated', 'films', 'fact', 'considerably', 'tamer', 'some.That', 'only', 'reason', 'gave', 'four', 'stars', 'not', 'five', 'Not', 'even', 'full-frontal', 'shots', 'Big', 'disappointment.However', 'everything', 'else', 'movie', 'grand-slam', 'Great', 'story', 'Nice', 'nudity', 'sexiness', 'Funny', 'Touching', 'even', 'moments', 'Thrilling', 'suspenseful', 'Well-written', 'most', 'part', 'very', 'well-acted.And', 'will', 'fall', 'love', 'adorable', 'lead', 'Algina', 'Lipskis', 'Absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'killer', 'body', ""n't"", 'mind', 'showing', 'off', 'really', 'good', 'little', 'actress', 'good', 'comedic', 'timing', ""'m"", 'going', 'try', 'find', 'more', 'films', 'them.Not', 'truly', 'example', 'soft-core', 'fare', 'half-step', 'backwards', 'true', 'erotic', 'thriller', 'territory', 'worth', 'viewing', 'even', 'dare', 'say', 'worth', 'buying']",N/A
1099826,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B000V9KHNK,trebe,"[0, 0]","Natasha (2007) features one brutally graphic murder, but rather than a suspenseful tale of cat and mouse, the film has a lighter more comedic approach, as a witnesses to murder, attempts to stay alive.Algina Lipskis gives a winning performance, displaying some comedic talent, as well as her luscious curves, as Anna, an exotic dancer at a club in Russia, who witnesses the murder of the club's manager, by underworld goons.  After the crooks mistakenly murder Anna's sister Natasha in quite spectacular fashion, Anna assumes Natasha's identity, and escapes to England posing as an exchange student.Upon her arrival in an English village, matters assume a lighter tone, as the strikingly lovely Russian, is taken in by vicar John Loomis (Richard Lintern), greatly affecting the lives of his children Christine (Jenna Harrison) and Robbie (Joseph O'Malley).  When a sexual encounter featuring Natasha is posted online, the Russian heavies arrive in the village to finish the job, trailed by police detective Petra Olescova (Sheyla Shehovich) who is investigating the murders.Light on violence, and with lots of decorative nudity, Natasha is a playful little action/comedy with an English flavor.  Algina Lipskis is quite engaging in her role, easily passing for a mischievous adolescent schoolgirl.
