421359,A9Y947FCJZPVL,6304431856,Arcadio Bolaos,"[3, 3]","Gregg Araki is a brilliant director that finds in subversive and polemic subjects a complexity and richness that would pass unnoticed for other filmmakers.""The Living End"" is a story that deals with death. However, unlike most movies Araki has found a balance between Freudian Eros and Thanatos. The life drive and the death drive are equally as important for Jon and Luke, the protagonists. They alternately assume different roles regarding impeding death. For Jon, at first, is denial when he confronts the fact that he has AIDS. He trusts in his doctor's words when is told that this diagnosis does not equal a death sentence. Not just yet anyway. Luke, on the other hand, has a clear self-destructive tendency; he seems to be wandering off amidst repellent streets and dangerous highways, with no goals and no real desire.They meet. They have sex. But here sex is devoid of the Freudian libido. Sex at first may be a consequence of the life drive but ultimately it's but an act of despair, it's the result of an undeniable lack of hope. And what is hope in the end? Is it an abstract concept or rather the force that prevent us from languishing in a situation in which our success is never guaranteed? I'd venture to say that hope comes down to one element: creation. And it's clear for the viewers that Jon and Luke will never be able to create a life together, their existence has already been forfeit.""Afterlife is just this pathetic notion people cling to in order to avoid confronting their own mortality"" explains Jon to Luke. And according to Slavoj Zizek he is absolutely right. InThe Plague of Fantasies (Second Edition  The Essential Zizek)Zizek explains that fantasy gives structure to reality. Fantasy is what allows people to confide in the symbolic order, fantasy is also more powerful than people might expect. Fantasy is the imaginary support upon which we build everything: we don't see human bodies we only see bodies through a certain fantasy; in fact, certain neurosis consist in seeing the body as it is (a disgusting cumulus of fluids, excrement, viscera and blood), and as a result there is a complete rejection of the other, or the constantly paranoid fear that contact with others will bring forth contamination or filthiness. Fantasy also structures desire (""what am I in the eyes of the other?""). Is Luke this rude, gay-macho version of Clint Eastwood or is this irresponsible, childish guy that makes Jon laugh with his nonsense? Is Jon this well-behaved gay, a productive member of society, or is he an absolute desperate person (willing to embark upon a nearly suicidal road trip with his newly found lover) that seeks out an indefinable truth that will give meaning to his remaining days? Fantasy also allows people to understand abstract concepts. What is a nation, for example? Benedict Anderson defines nations as ""imagined communities"", id est, arbitrary creations upon which people agree on.Nevertheless, the most important conception of fantasy here is that which veils and hides the real. Fantasy secludes oneself from the awful truth. Fantasy nurtures mythological and theological narratives that deal with something that has frightened people since the dawn of time: death. Sometimes, fantasies that veil the horror of death are as clumsy as the nice and tidy instructions and warnings one receives in every flight concerning the possibility of an ""accident"" (one has but to wonder what use a fastened security belt has when most airplane crushes end up turning people into a pulp, scattered tissue, that prevents even dental records to be obtained from the wreckage), but also as influencing and historically relevant as the heaven versus hell narrative that church still proclaims to this day.What is ""The Living End""? It is a glance of what happens once we withdraw from fantasy. Araki's film shows us what happens when death is no longer an abstract concern but a certainty. It demonstrates that a once life-driven Jon can lose all hope thanks to a medical diagnosis and thus embrace a death drive; it demonstrates that for all his bravado, Luke might not be the overtly self-destructive, death-seeking guy we saw in the first scenes. Life drive turns into death drive and vice versa (the extraordinary last scene condenses a powerful eroticism in contrast with an incontestable death wish). But one thing is clear: The veil has been removed and death no longer hides from mortal eyes. It's there, looking Jon and Luke right in the face. And they are looking back with a very fearless and subversive expression.",4,Death instinct and eroticism in a doomed gay couple,1320624000,"11 7, 2011",2011,4559,"['Gregg', 'Araki', 'brilliant', 'director', 'subversive', 'polemic', 'subjects', 'complexity', 'richness', 'would', 'pass', 'unnoticed', 'other', 'filmmakers', 'Living', 'End', 'story', 'deals', 'death', 'However', 'most', 'movies', 'Araki', 'found', 'balance', 'Freudian', 'Eros', 'Thanatos', 'life', 'drive', 'death', 'drive', 'are', 'equally', 'important', 'Jon', 'Luke', 'protagonists', 'alternately', 'assume', 'different', 'roles', 'regarding', 'impeding', 'death', 'Jon', 'first', 'denial', 'when', 'fact', 'AIDS', 'doctor', 'words', 'when', 'told', 'diagnosis', 'not', 'equal', 'death', 'sentence', 'Not', 'just', 'yet', 'anyway', 'Luke', 'other', 'hand', 'clear', 'self-destructive', 'tendency', 'be', 'wandering', 'off', 'amidst', 'repellent', 'streets', 'dangerous', 'highways', 'goals', 'real', 'desire.They', 'meet', 'have', 'sex', 'here', 'sex', 'devoid', 'Freudian', 'libido', 'Sex', 'first', 'may', 'be', 'consequence', 'life', 'drive', 'ultimately', 'act', 'despair', 'result', 'undeniable', 'lack', 'hope', 'what', 'hope', 'end', 'abstract', 'concept', 'rather', 'force', 'prevent', 'languishing', 'situation', 'success', 'never', 'guaranteed', ""'d"", 'venture', 'say', 'hope', 'down', 'one', 'element', 'creation', 'clear', 'viewers', 'Jon', 'Luke', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'able', 'create', 'life', 'together', 'existence', 'already', 'been', 'forfeit', 'Afterlife', 'just', 'pathetic', 'notion', 'people', 'cling', 'order', 'avoid', 'confronting', 'own', 'mortality', 'Jon', 'Luke', 'according', 'Slavoj', 'Zizek', 'absolutely', 'right', 'InThe', 'Plague', 'Fantasies', 'Second', 'Edition', 'Essential', 'Zizek', 'Zizek', 'fantasy', 'structure', 'reality', 'Fantasy', 'what', 'people', 'confide', 'symbolic', 'order', 'fantasy', 'also', 'more', 'powerful', 'people', 'might', 'expect', 'Fantasy', 'imaginary', 'support', 'build', 'everything', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'human', 'bodies', 'only', 'see', 'bodies', 'certain', 'fantasy', 'fact', 'certain', 'neurosis', 'consist', 'seeing', 'body', 'disgusting', 'cumulus', 'fluids', 'excrement', 'viscera', 'blood', 'result', 'complete', 'rejection', 'other', 'constantly', 'paranoid', 'fear', 'contact', 'others', 'will', 'bring', 'forth', 'contamination', 'filthiness', 'Fantasy', 'also', 'desire', 'what', 'am', 'eyes', 'other', 'Luke', 'rude', 'gay-macho', 'version', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'irresponsible', 'childish', 'guy', 'Jon', 'nonsense', 'Jon', 'well-behaved', 'gay', 'productive', 'member', 'society', 'absolute', 'desperate', 'person', 'willing', 'embark', 'nearly', 'suicidal', 'road', 'trip', 'newly', 'found', 'lover', 'out', 'indefinable', 'truth', 'will', 'give', 'meaning', 'remaining', 'days', 'Fantasy', 'also', 'people', 'understand', 'abstract', 'concepts', 'What', 'nation', 'example', 'Benedict', 'Anderson', 'nations', 'imagined', 'communities', 'id', 'est', 'arbitrary', 'creations', 'people', 'agree', 'on.Nevertheless', 'most', 'important', 'conception', 'fantasy', 'here', 'veils', 'real', 'Fantasy', 'awful', 'truth', 'Fantasy', 'mythological', 'theological', 'narratives', 'deal', 'something', 'frightened', 'people', 'dawn', 'time', 'death', 'Sometimes', 'fantasies', 'veil', 'horror', 'death', 'are', 'as', 'clumsy', 'nice', 'tidy', 'instructions', 'warnings', 'one', 'receives', 'flight', 'concerning', 'possibility', 'accident', 'one', 'wonder', 'what', 'use', 'fastened', 'security', 'belt', 'when', 'most', 'airplane', 'crushes', 'end', 'up', 'turning', 'people', 'pulp', 'scattered', 'tissue', 'prevents', 'even', 'dental', 'records', 'be', 'obtained', 'wreckage', 'also', 'influencing', 'historically', 'relevant', 'heaven', 'versus', 'hell', 'narrative', 'church', 'still', 'day.What', 'Living', 'End', 'glance', 'what', 'once', 'withdraw', 'fantasy', 'Araki', 'film', 'what', 'when', 'death', 'no', 'longer', 'abstract', 'concern', 'certainty', 'once', 'life-driven', 'Jon', 'can', 'lose', 'hope', 'thanks', 'medical', 'diagnosis', 'thus', 'embrace', 'death', 'drive', 'bravado', 'Luke', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'overtly', 'self-destructive', 'death-seeking', 'guy', 'saw', 'first', 'scenes', 'Life', 'drive', 'death', 'drive', 'vice', 'versa', 'extraordinary', 'last', 'scene', 'powerful', 'eroticism', 'contrast', 'incontestable', 'death', 'wish', 'one', 'thing', 'clear', 'veil', 'been', 'removed', 'death', 'no', 'longer', 'mortal', 'eyes', 'there', 'looking', 'Jon', 'Luke', 'right', 'face', 'are', 'looking', 'back', 'very', 'fearless', 'subversive', 'expression']",Living End VHS

And despite is poor production values and some what non-sense scripting, something about this movie struck a chord with me. Keep in mind the quality of this film is Very Low Budget Early 90's. But If you want to watch a Different Kind of ""Gay"" film.. I reccomend this. Also when I say gay, this movie is not about being gay at all, the two main characters are gay and are involved in some psycho-sexual adrenaline fueled relationship, but the fact that they are gay is somewhat incidental. Both of the men are HIV positive and dealing with that in their own way. One has just found out and is going through a phase of depression and isolation while the other is on some self destructive path of violence. They end up on a road-trip to escape the law that is evocative of ""Thelma and Louise."" The movie is really a commentary on the preception of HIV/AIDS at the time the movie was made from the view of two people afflicted with the disease. In true indy style, only the Author knows exactly what the point if this film is while the audience is left to come up with its own interpretation. But it is a movie that will make you think, it's got some nice eye candy, and an interesting story line. I reccomend this to anyone who 1-hasn't seen it yet & B- Is looking for maybe an angry movie featuring gay characters.

421366,A2198FZZMTJ38H,6304431856,D. Litton,"[22, 25]","""The Living End"" is an independent film in every sense of the word: no music, no production design or apparent costume design, no special effects or widescreen ratio, and no Hollywood gloss. What it does have it a simple story of two men involved in a ""Thelma and Louise"" storyline who share an offbeat, unconventional yet touching romance. Moments of black comedy tinged with violence and preachy dialogue provide a nice collaboration, though there are a few pitfalls involving the inclusion of supporting characters.The story goes like this: two guys are introduced to us in separate lifestyles. Jon has just discovered that he is HIV-positive, though his outlook on life is not so hindered as he expected it would be. Luke, a drifter, makes his way to the city, where, upon brutally murdering three gay-bashers, he hitches a ride with unsuspecting Jon back to his place, where quaint small talk turns into a night of passion.Right from the beginning, their attachment to one another is kinetic and bursting with energy, moreso than in the regular romances Hollywood pelts us with. Yet they have their disputes, and after a fight over Luke beating up a gay-basher, Jon demands that he leave, only to find that he cannot stop thinking about him. When Luke returns, he reveals that he has killed a cop, though Jon seems unmoved by the revelation, and continues to hold and embrace him, a very touching moment.The two embark on a journey to nowhere, where they discover their love for one another and the many differences they share on their outlook on society and life itself. Luke knows that he loves Jon more than anything else in life, but Jon becomes unsettled by Luke's violent acts and short fuse. The movie then generates into a question of whether they will be together in the end or not.Their relationship is unlike anything I've ever seen in a movie. At times, the rebel storyline takes a backseat to the passion shared by the two lovers. Luke's revelation of murder to Jon while in his arms is a very affecting moment, while sexual scenes shared between the two evolve into something more passionate and intimate, becoming more than just sex. Director/writer/editor/photographer Gregg Araki balances the sexual with the intimate in just the right manner.Araki also balances their relationship with violent acts and black comedy, the kind which leaves us confused as to whether or not we should laugh or think harder. The dialogue shared between Jon and Luke involves a lot of societal discussion, mainly about how AIDS has become a social disease instead of a physical one. Luke's disdain for society's treatment of him leads him on in his rampage, while Jon follows him because of his deep emotional attachment to him.More than just an examination of societal issues, the movie also uses the relationship between Jon and Luke to look at differences that can occur in a relationship. Jon is put off by the violence in his newfound love, and does not share the same beliefs as Luke. But that doesn't stop them from being together, nor does it succeed in tearing them apart. I think this is probably one of the strongest movie relationships portrayed in a film ever.The convincing elements of the movie are due in major part to actors Mike Dytri, playing Luke, and Craig Gilmore, playing Jon. Their chemistry is full of sexual and emotional energy, and in these types of scenes, their talent is beautifully put to good use. Dytri does a good job of portraying Luke as hardened but retaining a soft spot for Jon, while Gilmore portrays Jon as timid yet strong.So many good things come from this movie that my only complaint arises from the somewhat uninvolving storyline centering around Jon's friend, Darcy (Darcy Marta). While Jon is away on his adventure, she waits at home, sitting by the phone waiting for his call, driving her cheating boyfriend crazy. Her character seems a bit misplaced and uneven, though Marta's acting is certainly high-caliber.I remember, in my preteen years, I once wrote a small series of short stories involving adventures between two men in love. Seeing ""The Living End"" brought back memories of those stories, while also moving me in a way that seems hidden from me. I can't really say why this movie hooked me as it did: perhaps the wonderful acting and the articulate romance, or the offbeat feel of the movie that is a welcome touch after so many glossy movies. What I can say is that this is one of the best movies I've ever seen, and one of the most convincing. See it for what it really is: a heartfelt passionate love story amidst angst and societal furor.",5,Brilliance!

And yet, today (2005) we see that even with all the information, the cautionary advice, knowledge about how to prevent and avoid AIDS, many in the gay population are ignoring that advice and eschewing any protection and even refusing medication as some believe that there is NO such thing as AIDS. Rather it is the medication that is causing the sickness.When this film was made, it was full of sound and fury signifying ""something"", I'm sure. However, in retrospect, it is quite obviously a first attempt by a freshman director at writing and filming a feature film. On that front, it does not work.The acting in The Living End is so poor that it was painfully difficult for me to watch the film through to the end. The staging and premises were stilted and hackneyed. It would seem that the actors were cast for their ""hunk"" factor and nothing more.Araki has gone on to make more fully developed and complete films. The Living End is a film that started his career (though it wasn't really his first film) and certainly garnered him praise by the gonzo film set.However, if you are looking for a fully realized film like his own Mysterious Skin - don't look here. Parting Glances is a film that provides a far more full realization of the anger that some feel regarding AIDS. So too is Longtime Companion. The Living End tries to be a gay/AIDS Thelma and Louise.
