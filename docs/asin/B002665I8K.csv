A great story for those who want to instill positive values into their children, or (as an adult) just watch something that doesn't depress or leave a bad taste in your mouth.  There's a nice mix of &#34;reality&#34; and animation.

It may have passed for a made for TV movie in the 80's.  The poor acting is ridiculous.  Meaning no disrespect, Veritas' character acts very low functioning (IQ about 70 or so) or someone who had a brain injury .  He goes around doing things like screaming out at the airport ""I fly, I fly.  Veritas flies.  Just not in a plane."" In rainman tone.  His ""wings"" look like they attacked a group of maids at a convention then glued their dusters together, horrid.  Poor quality animation (you could make the argument they were trying to go for the ""comic book"" type of animation but it is horrid.  ALL the action scenes take place in an animation realm.  It is a simple and really ridiculous story (they save the world by drawing the comic book a certain way and then this awkward kid defeats the bad creature on his skateboard when the all powerful hero can not do it.  The guy never flies (just the animated version of him).  SPOLER ALERT: Do not read further if you want to actually torture yourself:  the end the mom and the boy who helps him end up going to live in the comic book world.  What?  Please spare yourself.  The only small population this may appeal to is a middle schooler who is absolutely nuts over comic books.",1,Unbelievably bad.
