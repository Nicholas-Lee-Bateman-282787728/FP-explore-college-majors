1143774,A1XE0O9OVY4RED,B0013LRKVM,Lady Pennington,"[1, 1]","Had to jump in here.  Gunsmoke was and still is my favorite Western.  Liked a few others,  but the writing and acting on Gunsmoke was so awesome,  that I watch it every time I get a chance.  About  9 years ago,  there was an offer from one of the magazines that mostly sold tapes.  So I got the first 3 Sasons at a very fair price.  Don't hate me but Bob Denver was not a favorite actor of mine,  and I found him to be boring.  Now I can start collecting again,  with Denver taken out.  Just a matter of taste folks,  mine LOL.  Fester amd Buck Owens,  excuse me,  I am not good on names,  will never be replaced.  Doc felt like a Father figure and the beautiful Amanda Blake was my favorite Actress for so many years.  Her looks were superb,  with those eyes sparkling or could be deadly cold.I cried for weeks when she left the show and cried for months when she passd away.  And then we had James Arnez who was first introduced by John Wayne.  James Arnez will always be Matt Dillion in my mind and Heart.  What a sweet Heart in real life.  Emailed him and got a reply right back.  He lived,  breathed Marshal Dillion.  So many Actors were in this show.  And the subjects were all way ahead of their time.  To me the writers were all geniuses.  Never before or after saw such writing,  except maybe for MASH.  Define Classic,  and you have Gunsmoke!  If only they made TV like that again.  I know many of you are annoyed about my remarks about Bob Denver,  I apologize but I stick to my opinion.  I liked him in other shows,  and my husband looks just like him,  but as far as Gunsmoke was concerned,  he just didn't keep up to the Giants on the show.  By Giants,  I don't mean well known Actors,  but Actors who could pour out their hearts to play a part that you or I will never ever forget.  Anyone who loved Gunsmoke must have this collection,  to watch whenever they feel down or just bored.  It will entertain you with real like Action from the old Days, when people were on their way west and stopped off at Dodge City.  A place where a person could get killed just passing by a store.  But then it had Marshal Dillion,  who put his blood,  muscle,  and Soul into saving the people he loved or didn't even know.  A Man who put Dodge City on the Map and got it a good reputation,  where people traveling,  but staying overnight could rest their weary bodies and feel safe,  just knowing they are in the most capable hands.  A Doctor who would give it his all to help anyone,  rich or poor,  feel better.  A Saloon owner who Sparkled just standing behind the bar and treated everyone how they deserved to be treated,  And a shaggy whisker wearer,  who had old town skills and also would help anyone who needed help.  He couldn't read or write,  but had more common sense than any College Graduate.  And a gun maker and fixer who fixed bodies part time,  with a baby face and a Gentleman through and through.  They weren't just Actors who played a part,  but Professional people who bought the old days of Dodge City to life again for us to visit,  to admire,  to cry or to laugh.  This was Television at it's finest.

1143782,ANUJUFRP6RNA2,B0013LRKVM,O'Dryden,"[14, 14]","This show keeps getting better. I now have the complete set for season two and although I am not happy about the pricing, I refuse to protest the business practices of the company that packaged the best drama/adventure series ever created.This season continues to depict the dark side of human nature and the unpredictability of life in the most honest manner I have ever seen on television. Matt Dillon, Chester Goode, Kitty Russell, and Doc Adams form a tight circle of friendship and battle against those who refuse to obey the laws of Dodge and not adhere to basic laws of decency. The brutality and depravity of human nature is on full display. Many of the episodes do not contain the traditional ""feel good"" endings, which I like because I think it adds to the shows intensity. Most importantly, Marshall Dillon, who is portrayed as a larger then life character, also exhibits weaknesses, doubts, and emotions like all of us. He is not perfect but you know he is doing his best to perform the almost impossible task of trying to maintain law and order on the wild frontier.Season 2 climbed in the TV ratings to number 8. James Arness was nominated for Best Continuing Performance by an Actor in a Dramatic Series. This series is the best TV show I own and I thoroughly enjoy watching it with my kids. My biggest problem is that my 13 year old son and 11 year old daughter want to watch all the episodes right away. I need to limit the viewing so that we can get at least a months worth of enjoyment out of it.If you don't like paying the high price for half a season, you can wait until season 3 arrives because like other companies, I think eventually they will package season 2 Vol 1 and Vol 2 into one set and reduce the price to around $[...]. This is what other companies are doing. The risk you run is not having the set available because it is sold out. My final recommendation: Buy it, buy it, buy it.",5,It Keeps Getting Better,1212364800,"06 2, 2008",2008,1915,"['show', 'getting', 'better', 'now', 'have', 'complete', 'set', 'season', 'two', 'am', 'not', 'happy', 'pricing', 'refuse', 'protest', 'business', 'practices', 'company', 'packaged', 'best', 'drama/adventure', 'series', 'ever', 'season', 'depict', 'dark', 'side', 'human', 'nature', 'unpredictability', 'life', 'most', 'honest', 'manner', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'television', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'Chester', 'Goode', 'Kitty', 'Russell', 'Doc', 'Adams', 'form', 'tight', 'circle', 'friendship', 'battle', 'who', 'refuse', 'obey', 'laws', 'Dodge', 'not', 'adhere', 'basic', 'laws', 'decency', 'brutality', 'depravity', 'human', 'nature', 'full', 'display', 'Many', 'episodes', 'do', 'not', 'contain', 'traditional', 'feel', 'good', 'endings', 'like', 'think', 'shows', 'intensity', 'Most', 'importantly', 'Marshall', 'Dillon', 'who', 'portrayed', 'larger', 'then', 'life', 'character', 'also', 'weaknesses', 'doubts', 'emotions', 'not', 'perfect', 'know', 'doing', 'best', 'perform', 'almost', 'impossible', 'task', 'trying', 'maintain', 'law', 'order', 'wild', 'frontier.Season', '2', 'climbed', 'TV', 'ratings', 'number', '8', 'James', 'Arness', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Continuing', 'Performance', 'Actor', 'Dramatic', 'Series', 'series', 'best', 'TV', 'show', 'own', 'thoroughly', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'kids', 'biggest', 'problem', '13', 'year', 'old', 'son', '11', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'want', 'watch', 'episodes', 'right', 'away', 'need', 'limit', 'viewing', 'so', 'can', 'get', 'least', 'months', 'enjoyment', 'it.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'paying', 'high', 'price', 'season', 'can', 'wait', 'season', '3', 'arrives', 'other', 'companies', 'think', 'eventually', 'will', 'package', 'season', '2', 'Vol', '1', 'Vol', '2', 'one', 'set', 'reduce', 'price', '[', ']', 'what', 'other', 'companies', 'are', 'doing', 'risk', 'run', 'not', 'having', 'set', 'available', 'sold', 'out', 'final', 'recommendation', 'Buy', 'buy', 'buy']","Gunsmoke: Season 2, Vol. 2"
