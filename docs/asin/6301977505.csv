286563,A2PV6GK1HV54Y9,6301977505,ADRIENNE MILLER,"[0, 0]","Shoot the Moon starring Albert Finney and Diane Keaton is a blistering, explosive, and unflinching film about a two stubborn people who's marriage is starting to unravel with great speed. Finney and Keaton are remarkable as George and Faith Dunlap. George has decided to leave his wife for a self-assured woman who's also married. Faith and George have 4 girls and the oldest girl deeply resents her father for walking out. Along the way, Faith begins a romantic relationship with a much younger man and George becomes enraged towards Faith and you just have to see the ending to believe it! Shoot the Moon is a film that doesn't sugarcoat anything about a marriage on the brink of collapse. I highly recommend this film, it will leave you speechless!",5,An underrated masterpiece.,1326240000,"01 11, 2012",2012,751,"['Shoot', 'Moon', 'starring', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'blistering', 'explosive', 'unflinching', 'film', 'two', 'stubborn', 'people', 'who', 'marriage', 'starting', 'unravel', 'great', 'speed', 'Finney', 'Keaton', 'are', 'remarkable', 'George', 'Faith', 'Dunlap', 'George', 'decided', 'leave', 'wife', 'self-assured', 'woman', 'who', 'also', 'married', 'Faith', 'George', 'have', '4', 'girls', 'oldest', 'girl', 'deeply', 'father', 'walking', 'out', 'way', 'Faith', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'much', 'younger', 'man', 'George', 'becomes', 'enraged', 'towards', 'Faith', 'just', 'have', 'see', 'ending', 'believe', 'Shoot', 'Moon', 'film', ""n't"", 'sugarcoat', 'anything', 'marriage', 'brink', 'collapse', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'will', 'leave', 'speechless']",N/A
286564,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6301977505,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 3]","Some films understand how to completely wreck a person by delving so honestly into a controversial subject that we, the audience, lose ourselves in the `art' and become a part of the story.  Be forewarned that `Shoot the Moon' is that type of a film; a film so earnest in it's blunt and brutal storytelling that it ignores Hollywood's tendency to candy coat this subject matter and, instead, hands us the beating heart of two lost souls.There are no happy endings.While not as elaborate as Ingmar Bergman's `Scenes From a Marriage' (not many films are), I've readily drawn comparisons between these two films before, and I wouldn't be hesitant to do it now.  The fact remains that `Shoot the Moon' understands that not everything is `fixable', even in the movies, and not all decisions made are advantageous.  Dissecting the aftermath of rash mistakes, this film takes the viewer to the depths of Hades.  While Bergman's character study certainly gave its characters a near 360 development, `Shoot the Moon' isn't so kind.  It never brings us back from the brinks of hell.The film tells the story of a crumbling marriage.  George Dunlap is carrying on an affair, and when it finally comes to a head, he leaves his wife Faith and their children.  After his decision is made, George finds accepting his own fate hard to do, especially when his ex-wife begins to move on in ways he didn't expect.  It is all too true that we often make decisions that bite us, and George realizes that almost immediately.  The couple's children all play a part in George's emotion demise, especially his eldest daughter who holds a severe grudge against her father.For me, this film is near perfection; in a staggering and emotionally destructive kind of way.  Having personally been in the emotional conundrum created by separation (never been divorced, but have come close) I see so much of my own emotional journey in George and even Faith.This film just bleeds honesty to me.Albert Finney and Diane Keaton deliver some of their finest work to date here, especially Finney who is monstrous in his depiction of George.  He peals back each layer with expert precision.  Keaton is an actress who I either wholly adore or kind incredibly grating, there is no middle ground.  For me, this is probably her best work.  She sinks inside the river of emotions within Faith's core and delivers a brutally honest portrayal of a woman confused by her own situation.  I love that her natural theatrics, which are always the determining factor in her greatness or insufferableness, are beautifully restrained here to aid in her construction of this woman.Yeah, I recommend this one; a lot.",5,Fire on the sides of my face...,1300320000,"03 17, 2011",2011,2658,"['films', 'understand', 'how', 'completely', 'wreck', 'person', 'delving', 'so', 'honestly', 'controversial', 'subject', 'audience', 'lose', 'ourselves', 'art', 'become', 'part', 'story', 'Be', 'forewarned', 'Shoot', 'Moon', 'type', 'film', 'film', 'so', 'earnest', 'blunt', 'brutal', 'storytelling', 'Hollywood', 'tendency', 'candy', 'coat', 'subject', 'matter', 'instead', 'beating', 'heart', 'two', 'lost', 'are', 'happy', 'endings.While', 'not', 'as', 'elaborate', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'Scenes', 'Marriage', 'not', 'many', 'films', 'are', ""'ve"", 'readily', 'drawn', 'comparisons', 'two', 'films', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'hesitant', 'do', 'now', 'fact', 'Shoot', 'Moon', 'understands', 'not', 'everything', 'fixable', 'even', 'movies', 'not', 'decisions', 'made', 'are', 'advantageous', 'Dissecting', 'aftermath', 'rash', 'mistakes', 'film', 'viewer', 'depths', 'Hades', 'Bergman', 'character', 'study', 'certainly', 'gave', 'characters', 'near', '360', 'development', 'Shoot', 'Moon', ""n't"", 'so', 'kind', 'never', 'back', 'brinks', 'hell.The', 'film', 'story', 'crumbling', 'marriage', 'George', 'Dunlap', 'carrying', 'affair', 'when', 'finally', 'head', 'wife', 'Faith', 'children', 'decision', 'made', 'George', 'accepting', 'own', 'fate', 'hard', 'do', 'especially', 'when', 'ex-wife', 'move', 'ways', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'too', 'true', 'often', 'make', 'decisions', 'bite', 'George', 'almost', 'immediately', 'couple', 'children', 'play', 'part', 'George', 'emotion', 'demise', 'especially', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'who', 'severe', 'grudge', 'father.For', 'film', 'perfection', 'staggering', 'emotionally', 'destructive', 'kind', 'way', 'Having', 'personally', 'been', 'emotional', 'conundrum', 'created', 'separation', 'never', 'been', 'divorced', 'have', 'come', 'close', 'see', 'so', 'much', 'own', 'emotional', 'journey', 'George', 'even', 'Faith.This', 'film', 'just', 'honesty', 'me.Albert', 'Finney', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'deliver', 'finest', 'work', 'date', 'here', 'especially', 'Finney', 'who', 'monstrous', 'depiction', 'George', 'back', 'layer', 'expert', 'precision', 'Keaton', 'actress', 'who', 'either', 'wholly', 'adore', 'kind', 'incredibly', 'grating', 'middle', 'ground', 'probably', 'best', 'work', 'sinks', 'river', 'emotions', 'Faith', 'core', 'brutally', 'honest', 'portrayal', 'woman', 'confused', 'own', 'situation', 'love', 'natural', 'theatrics', 'are', 'always', 'determining', 'factor', 'greatness', 'insufferableness', 'are', 'beautifully', 'restrained', 'here', 'aid', 'construction', 'woman.Yeah', 'recommend', 'one', 'lot']",N/A

Furthermore there's a lot of extremely sexually explicit dialogue as well, so it's no wonder the film is R rated.

However the topic of divorce, one parent leaving the family and a child feeling angry and hurt by it is something every family of divorce goes through.

286569,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,6301977505,David Baldwin,"[4, 6]","When ""Shoot the Moon"" begins the union of George(Albert Finney) and Faith Dunlap (Diane Keaton) is already in it's death throes just ready to put in the final nails and throw some dirt on it.  As they prepare for an awards dinner, George is upstairs on the phone with his girlfriend(Karen Allen) while downstairs Faith pretends not to notice while preparing their four young daughters for bed.  The next day they officially call it quits and in the ensuing weeks the Dunlaps barely maintain their civility towards each other ""for the sake of the kids"".  What makes ""Shoot the Moon"" most compelling is how the breakup effects the girls.  Sherry (Dana Hill), the oldest and has the best comprehension of what's happening, is a ball of seething emotions.  George's betrayal of her mother was a betrayal of her as well.  There's a very raw scene in the film where George wants to present Sherry with the gift of a typewriter for her birthday and Sherry won't accept it.  The younger girls are oblivious to the situation and continue on despite this interruption of their routine.  An awkward scene involves the girls greeting their father's girlfriend in the presence of their mother.  You believe these girls to be sisters which shouldn't be surprising since two of the actresses playing them are Tina Yothers(TV's ""Family Ties"") and Tracey Gold (""TV's ""Growing Pains"").  There are no convenient villains here and you sympathize with all involved.  Credit stars Finney and Keaton for delivering subtle performances with little showiness or histrionics.  Director Alan Parker and screenwiter Bo Goldman have crafted a work that is both mesmerizing and heartbreaking.

However, the similarities seem to end there.Diane Keaton and Albert Finney play the husband and wife in ""Shoot the Moon"", and they are both absolutely superb.

It never ceases to amaze me how Hollywood has such a difficult time portraying real-life relationships on the silver screen.  Here we have the struggling writer who finally pens an award-winning novel.  The only problem is that he no longer has any contact with reality, much less his family.  He is torn between a new love affair and his wife and four daughters.  When called on his affair, he storms out of the house as though he were the one who had been wronged.  But, after his wife manages to put back the pieces and now seems to have a reasonably healthy relationship with a younger man, the irate husband returns.  Not because he is unhappy in his new relationship, but because he is damn mad his wife can be happy without him.  Finney and Keaton fail to make this stormy relationship work despite their bravado performances.  The scenes are implausible and by movie's end it is unbearable to watch, especially as the older daughter tries to make sense of her childish parents. She shouts a few expletives for Hollywood sake it seems, as they ring hollow like the rest of the movie.The movie appears to be what someone imagines a divorce being, not what it actually is. The settings are too idyllic for a struggling writer.  Here they are living in a huge Victorian house in a romantic town in Northern California, yet the daughters sleep two to a bed. He has a writer's cabin by the surf, where he is able to break away from the din of bringing up family, and ultimately pursue his affair.

286576,A123TO6OM5CG9T,6301977505,Judith T. Giles,"[2, 2]","George and Faith Dunlap are getting a divorce. This mostly affects  George, Faith, and their eldest daughter. George's new love interest,with whom he now resides, tells George that if he doesn't work out, she will go on to find someone who will. Faith's new love interest, the creator of a tennis court that is being developed on the sprawling Dunlap family property during the whole film, seems quite taken by Faith, yet seems to be a survivor of the school of hard knocks, even at a relatively youthful age, and someone able to pull himself together should life throw him any pitfall. One scene I always remember from the film happens when George introduces his four girls to his girlfriend at her beach property for the first time. The girlfriend, with an enormous smile [Karen Allen has an enormous smile], tells the girls that she has cookies and lemonade. The girls exchange a conspiratory disgustful look [who, but someone evil, would mess with the classic, milk and cookies] and at the moment one knows that she will not be on the girls' team, and because of that, they most likely will not be on hers. Familiarity is a theme throughout the film. Even though one senses that things were not good at Faith and George's house before they separated routine seems to be something they all used to depend on, and begin to miss, especially when they realize that those days are gone for good.Someone told me that she saw this in a ""family living"" class at school.

286578,A2LJKDPRVR907S,6301977505,Lisa Siegel,"[20, 20]","One of the main reasons I rented and then bought this movie was because Diane Keaton was in it.  Together, she and Albert Finney make this movie a truly devistating, powerful story of a couple who find that after fifteen years of marriage, it's over.  Both performances were incredible, as was the performance of the oldest daughter, played by the late Dana Hill.  She gave such a powerful performance, as a girl who didn't know whether to love or hate her father for leaving the family.What made this a true gem was the relationship you see between Diane Keaton's character (Faith Dunlap) and her four children.  You can automatically see how much she loves them and that she wants to protect them.  At the same time, however, Albert Finney's character (George Dunlap) is taking the divorce in two separate directions: he's happy to not be living with his wife, but he misses her at the same time.  You can immediately see that he loves the children as well and they love him.The part that was very difficult to watch was when he (Finney) wanted to give Sherri (Dana Hill) her birthday present and she didn't want it.  He got into the house anyway and locked Faith out and beat down his daughter's door and just let his rage out on her.  It was so difficult to watch him to this, and the reaction of what he did, or realized what he did to his daughter brought tears to my eyes.  Especially when Faith comforted her daughter and George saw that the two had a special relationship.I would recommend this movie to people over the age of 18, since it is very powerful and has a lot of adult language and adult situations.",5,Powerful,1058745600,"07 21, 2003",2003,1619,"['One', 'main', 'reasons', 'rented', 'then', 'bought', 'movie', 'was', 'because', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'was', 'Together', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'make', 'movie', 'truly', 'devistating', 'powerful', 'story', 'couple', 'who', 'find', 'fifteen', 'years', 'marriage', 'over', 'performances', 'were', 'incredible', 'was', 'performance', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'played', 'late', 'Dana', 'Hill', 'gave', 'such', 'powerful', 'performance', 'girl', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'love', 'hate', 'father', 'leaving', 'family.What', 'made', 'true', 'gem', 'was', 'relationship', 'see', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'character', 'Faith', 'Dunlap', 'four', 'children', 'can', 'automatically', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'protect', 'same', 'time', 'however', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'character', 'George', 'Dunlap', 'taking', 'divorce', 'two', 'separate', 'directions', 'happy', 'not', 'be', 'living', 'wife', 'same', 'time', 'can', 'immediately', 'see', 'children', 'well', 'love', 'him.The', 'part', 'was', 'very', 'difficult', 'watch', 'was', 'when', 'Finney', 'wanted', 'give', 'Sherri', 'Dana', 'Hill', 'birthday', 'present', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'got', 'house', 'anyway', 'locked', 'Faith', 'beat', 'down', 'daughter', 'door', 'just', 'let', 'rage', 'out', 'was', 'so', 'difficult', 'watch', 'reaction', 'what', 'did', 'realized', 'what', 'did', 'daughter', 'brought', 'tears', 'eyes', 'Especially', 'when', 'Faith', 'comforted', 'daughter', 'George', 'saw', 'two', 'had', 'special', 'relationship.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'people', 'age', '18', 'very', 'powerful', 'lot', 'adult', 'language', 'adult', 'situations']",N/A

Infidelity leads one of them to leave after being found out. This in turn leads to a pending divorce and how many times a week they get to see their children. Sounds familiar but this movie has a certain flair to it. It has alot of creativity and underlying emotions that can be seen by exceptional acting. This movie shows how it might feel to go through a separation from someone you have known and loved for a long time. It isn't just an easy thing and this movie points that out. Each partner grieves and gets angry and bargains, just like when you are dealing with death. The cinematography is quite nice. The relationship the children have with their parents is original, and highly entertaining, especially how they interact with Keaton. The house they live in is so cozy and warm, I wish I lived in it. The ending really hits home and leaves you wondering if she will forgive him? I guess the viewer gets to answer the question.

This might be comedy rather than tragedy were it not for the presence of the couple's 3 daughters, the oldest of whom (Dana Hill) holds a particular grudge against her father.So the feel of the film is closer to a beautifully staged TV commercial than a searing Ingmar Bergman movie. Bo Goldman's script is heartfelt, but there doesn't seem to be much going on beneath the surface of this familiar saga.The performances by Finney and Keaton are expert, chivvying in whatever subtlety they can manage within Parker's overbearing world.
