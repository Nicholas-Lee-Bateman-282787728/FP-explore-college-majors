I finally viewed it online, and I can see why this movie has gotten so much praise by audiences. It's a very well-paced, written, acted and directed piece, miles ahead of many of the TV movies that air today. Is it just me or are the television movies of the 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s much better and more entertaining? At first, we don't realize there's more going on beneath the surface of this ""typical American family"" until about 15 minutes in. We discover then that they are all still coping with a terrible tragedy that occurred the year before. The oldest daughter, Jennifer (Kristen Cumming), was killed in a car accident while the rest of the family survived. The father, Phillip (Dennis Weaver) is clearly a borderline alcoholic who would rather not discuss or deal with what happened, and doesn't want to accept how Jennifer's death affected the children. Mother Laura (Valerie Harper) is far more open-minded regarding the latter but they, along with her mother Bernice (the always reliable Ruth Gordon), are still blaming themselves and to an extent, each other - for what happened. However, most traumatized seems to be Mary (Robin Ignico), the remaining daughter. She hears voices and begins to encounter her sister's spirit - and the two begin to plan revenge on the family. It seems that young Mary was the only one who really loved Jennifer and misses her - at least that is what Jennifer would have us and Mary believe. But as things escalate and fatal ""accidents"" begin to occur, we begin to suspect that there's more to the story - and there is. The climax is indeed a twist ending that most will not see coming - things are not as they seem. And that alone is enough to recommend this movie.Young actors Robin Ignico, Kristen Cumming and Oliver Robins (of ""Poltergiest"" fame, who here plays brother Kevin) are all very natural in their roles - Cumming is both childlike and eerie, Ignico is amazing as Mary (I only remembered her as Duffy from ""Annie""), and Robins is totally believable as the annoying younger brother. Valerie Harper rips your heart out as Laura - Dennis Weaver's portrayal is a bit more understated but he also is very good. And what more can be said about Ruth Gordon - she is incredible as the eccentric granny. Director Richard Lang and writer Ned Wynn need more recognition for there work on this film, as do the actors.I can see why the title is ""Don't Go To Sleep"" because I sure had a hard time nodding off after watching it!

I saw this in the early 80's when I was over at my girlfriend's house and I still remember it very well. The last shot in the movie is really a corker.

722493,A387BD735MI50R,B00006RCUE,R. Schultz,"[0, 0]","This might be one of the top 25 or 50 scariest movies of all time. In order to rank high, at least in my book, a thriller needs to deliver more than just the brief fright of a maniac jumping out of the dark. It needs to re-define some object or some setting that we took as commonplace before, and to make manifest the danger posed by that thing. It must animate the everyday with evil.This movie accomplishes that. What ""Psycho"" did for motel showers - this movie does for pizza cutters. But more than that, it casts a fear in us of becoming the target of revenge - of a remorseless, smiling revenge - more personal, more pointed than ""The Grudge.""The movie's title is a misnomer. ""Don't Go to Sleep"" suggests that this might be some ""Elm Street"" sequel. And that's not it at all. A better title might have been ""The Unforgiven"" - but that title has since been taken, so no good considering it now.Some of the acting here is a little creaky. Valerie Harper isn't at her best. Ruth Gordon reprises the turn she'd been doing as an elderly herky-jerky annoyance since ""Rosemary's Baby."" She doesn't add anything new to the limited repertoire of mannerisms she perfected in that major motion picture thriller. But the children in this film are outstanding. They exhibit an extraordinary range, mutating from innocence to a chilling determination.The closing scene is absolutely hair-raising - and will probably haunt you for a long time to come.This was a made-for-TV movie, and doesn't yet seem to be available in any commercial format.

This may have been a made-for-TV film, but it has certainly withstood the test of time. There are no real special effects to speak of, but what this film lacks in slick production qualities it more than makes up for in excellent performances by the cast.The story revolves around a family recovering from the unexpected death of their young daughter. A year later, Philip (Dennis Weaver) and Laura (Valerie Harper)  have just moved into a new home with Laura's mother, and the couple's two young children, Mary and Kevin. Before long, Mary begins to experience nightmares of her dead sister Jennifer who soon materializes in tangible form and begins to wreak havoc in the family's life.The actress who portrayed the vengeful spirit of Jennifer (Kristin Cumming) did a credible job in her role. This young child spirit is malicious and pure evil, exacting vengeance on her own family members. There's a particular scene with a pizza cutter that is effectively chilling.
