He is a solicitor representing every eccentric who resides in the  small Norfolk town of Market Shipborough, England. It is filmed in Norfolk in the East of the England, known as the fens, which is a very flat and a wild a wooly part of England. The beach and water Kingdom loves to walk and jog along is the very cold North Sea. The scenery is gorgeous.I am forced to compare this series with his acting work as Oscar Wilde and Jeeves, not to mention his skits with Hugh Laurie.  This is just not on the same level.  He does a very good job and the stories are interesting but I miss his wit being on display.  This is Stephen Fry in a role where the character is a really nice, bright guy but never what one would call a wit.  It is really hard for me to see him in this role.  The series, however, is low key and charming so most viewers will enjoy it.",4,Good But I Prefer Fry In His More Satiric Guise,1267920000,"03 7, 2010",2010,901,"['Fry', 'character', 'Peter', 'Kingdom', 'nice', 'guy', 'solicitor', 'representing', 'eccentric', 'who', 'small', 'Norfolk', 'town', 'Market', 'Shipborough', 'England', 'filmed', 'Norfolk', 'East', 'England', 'known', 'fens', 'very', 'flat', 'wild', 'wooly', 'part', 'England', 'beach', 'water', 'Kingdom', 'walk', 'jog', 'along', 'very', 'cold', 'North', 'Sea', 'scenery', 'gorgeous.I', 'am', 'forced', 'compare', 'series', 'acting', 'work', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'Jeeves', 'not', 'mention', 'skits', 'Hugh', 'Laurie', 'just', 'not', 'same', 'level', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'stories', 'are', 'interesting', 'miss', 'wit', 'being', 'display', 'Stephen', 'Fry', 'role', 'where', 'character', 'really', 'nice', 'bright', 'guy', 'never', 'what', 'one', 'would', 'call', 'wit', 'really', 'hard', 'see', 'role', 'series', 'however', 'low', 'key', 'charming', 'so', 'most', 'viewers', 'will', 'enjoy']",N/A

My only gripe with them, is that there wasn't a fourth.Set in the fictional coastal town of Market Shipborough (you could almost believe the name was that of a real town!) Its the tale of a solicitor and his clients, and of course his family and their endless secrets and troubles. His sister's got emotional stability problems, (and she flaunts them), his brother faked his own death and seems to have the mob chasing him, while his clients never seem to need so much legal counsel as they do practical solutions to bizarre problems.The residents of the town are colourful, quaint, and maybe just slightly mad, and yet still lovable. Its the sort of town where you would love to spend a day just meeting and greeting and possibly doing a little snooping, and wondering if you were still in the real world.This is gentle British humour at its best and I heartily recommend it to anyone who likes to watch a show with a smile on his or her face.",5,Excellent British Humour,1311206400,"07 21, 2011",2011,1057,"['have', 'three', 'seasons', 'Kingdom', 'could', 'not', 'rate', 'one', 'better', 'then', 'others', 'are', 'excellent', 'only', 'gripe', 'was', ""n't"", 'fourth.Set', 'fictional', 'coastal', 'town', 'Market', 'Shipborough', 'could', 'almost', 'believe', 'name', 'was', 'real', 'town', 'tale', 'solicitor', 'clients', 'course', 'family', 'endless', 'secrets', 'troubles', 'sister', 'got', 'emotional', 'stability', 'problems', 'brother', 'faked', 'own', 'death', 'have', 'mob', 'chasing', 'clients', 'never', 'seem', 'need', 'so', 'much', 'legal', 'counsel', 'do', 'practical', 'solutions', 'bizarre', 'problems.The', 'residents', 'town', 'are', 'colourful', 'quaint', 'maybe', 'just', 'slightly', 'mad', 'yet', 'still', 'lovable', 'sort', 'town', 'where', 'would', 'love', 'spend', 'day', 'just', 'meeting', 'greeting', 'possibly', 'doing', 'little', 'snooping', 'wondering', 'were', 'still', 'real', 'world.This', 'gentle', 'British', 'humour', 'best', 'heartily', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'watch', 'show', 'smile', 'face']",N/A
