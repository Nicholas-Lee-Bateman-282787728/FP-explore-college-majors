864725,A1DU5Y82061TP8,B0006A9IVQ,"Anna M. Seidler ""Fog City person""","[0, 0]","Sun Flower sets its story in Italy and Russia, as a man during World War 2 in Italy marries a beautiful woman to earn a month's leave.  I had the impression that if the young woman (Sophia Loren) hadn't suggested that they marry to gain the time off before he leaves for war, he wouldn't have married.  He is a charming man who has no shortage of attractive women waiting to be with him.  After their marriage, the soldier, Marcello Mastroianni,  is sent to Russia to make up for the fact that he had a weddingextended time.  Both are very saddened because they'd had only a month together during which time they facetiously attempted to have him exempted because of a make believe ailment.  The German officers weren't deceived so off he goes to Russia, where the German and Italian troups were mostly wiped out or captured by the Russians.Sophia's character never gives up on trying to locate her husband, Marcello.  Eventually she has a passport and permission to travel to Russia in order to locate her husband.Not knowing of the physical hardships that Marcello Mastroianni had suffered and that his life had been saved by a Russian woman who had dragged him to safety, she sees the lovely young woman in the backyard of their home.  The story goes on from there to a bittersweet ending which is plauisible.  A good movie over all.Anna M.

Her smiles are radiant, her body incredible and her intelligent understanding of pathos breaks your heart. With the announcement of the departure of her newly-wed husband, Marcello Mastroanni, to the front, they both cook up a scheme to avoid him taken into the Italian army, but everything falls apart and from there Loren's heartbreak and search begin. She waits years, has a baby and finally decides to go to the Soviet Union to look for him. What she finds is terribly unexpected and her scene at the railway station is unforgettable and reveals why she's such a phenominal actress. (Get the hankies out for this one because you'll need them). I could see why she's been internationally acclaimed. If only she had gotten better roles. Her husband shows up one night and the two have a conversation in her dark apartment; there's no light between these two anymore, just regrets. When you think about it though, not one letter, not one photo over the years, and then the rest of what hapens to him, he's pretty much of a cad and really doesn't deserve any sympathy. Get this film if only for Loren's gut-wrenching performance.",4,Sophia Loren Is The Real Sunflower,1099699200,"11 6, 2004",2004,1276,"['have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'DVD', 'version', 'have', 'seen', 'VHS', 'version', 'even', 'color', 'was', 'washed', 'out', 'could', ""n't"", 'take', 'eyes', 'off', 'Sophia', 'Loren', 'smiles', 'are', 'radiant', 'body', 'incredible', 'intelligent', 'understanding', 'pathos', 'breaks', 'heart', 'announcement', 'departure', 'newly-wed', 'husband', 'Marcello', 'Mastroanni', 'front', 'cook', 'up', 'scheme', 'avoid', 'taken', 'Italian', 'army', 'everything', 'falls', 'apart', 'Loren', 'heartbreak', 'search', 'begin', 'years', 'baby', 'finally', 'decides', 'go', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'look', 'What', 'terribly', 'unexpected', 'scene', 'railway', 'station', 'unforgettable', 'reveals', 'why', 'such', 'phenominal', 'actress', 'Get', 'hankies', 'out', 'one', ""'ll"", 'need', 'could', 'see', 'why', 'been', 'internationally', 'acclaimed', 'only', 'had', 'gotten', 'better', 'roles', 'husband', 'up', 'one', 'night', 'two', 'have', 'conversation', 'dark', 'apartment', 'light', 'two', 'anymore', 'just', 'regrets', 'When', 'think', 'not', 'one', 'letter', 'not', 'one', 'photo', 'years', 'then', 'rest', 'what', 'pretty', 'much', 'cad', 'really', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'sympathy', 'Get', 'film', 'only', 'Loren', 'gut-wrenching', 'performance']",N/A
