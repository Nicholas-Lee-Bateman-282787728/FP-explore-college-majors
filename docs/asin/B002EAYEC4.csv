The actors were excellent with the exception of Roger Moore who was completely miss cast. Angie Dickinson and Peter Finch do a first class job, in fact this is one the best performances I've seen from Angie Dickinson, totally believeable. This is a movie that will appeal to wide cross section of people who enjoy romantic adventure stories. Definitely worth a watch.",4,Tony Land - Brisbane,1357430400,"01 6, 2013",2013,455,"['Enjoyable', 'movie', 'good', 'story', 'line', 'involving', 'very', 'interesting', 'character', 'assessments', 'actors', 'were', 'excellent', 'exception', 'Roger', 'Moore', 'who', 'was', 'completely', 'miss', 'cast', 'Angie', 'Dickinson', 'Peter', 'Finch', 'do', 'first', 'class', 'job', 'fact', 'one', 'best', 'performances', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Angie', 'Dickinson', 'totally', 'believeable', 'movie', 'will', 'appeal', 'wide', 'cross', 'section', 'people', 'who', 'enjoy', 'romantic', 'adventure', 'stories', 'Definitely', 'watch']",Sins of Rachel Cade
