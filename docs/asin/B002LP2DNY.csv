1277114,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B002LP2DNY,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[3, 4]","Columbo is a legend in detective series and he was often imitated but never equalled. He was also parodied, with half a dozen of other sleuths, private eyes, amateur detectives and free-lance bounty hunters in ""Murder by Death"" but in vain in a way, though the meeting with Miss Marple was more than funny.Columbo brings first of all in the picture an old French car from the 50s, a Peugeot mind you, that is banged up and scratched in all possible indecent ways, that can fart with a boom when a surprise is necessary, whose door does not open when it is most irritating for it not to open, irritating for the audience of course, the audience in the room, or the audience in the film, the other cops or the criminals who are irritated by the sole presence of Columbo, as if he were some perambulating poison ivy. And rest assured that this reluctant door is planned through and through by the crafty lieutenant.Then he displays an inconsiderate way of dressing badly with a trench coat that looks like the coat of a flasher, or a bum or homeless beggar, with a shirt that is never very pure and a tie that is everything but flashy, in fact sore and dull. His hair is greyish except when he dyes it more or less red for the sake of a case. He smokes a disgusting cigar and drops his ashes everywhere. He even takes an ugly dog along from time to time, with a big metal bowl and some water to give him a drink when he arrives on the crime scene.He has a wife who is like the Arlesian woman from the eponymous opera by Bizet who is never seen but always spoken of and about. She is his permanent reference when he wants to confuse a suspect. I just wonder what he could do without his wife who apparently has no originality or original tastes because she is the pure virtual embodiment or impersonation of the most middle of the way unoriginal banal middle class non-working childless housewife you can imagine.The best part about Columbo is his method. He appears sloppy but he is sloppy on purpose. He only deals with the top society criminals of Beverley Hills mostly, in Los Angeles as you know very well, and these pretend they are the best and most organized criminals of all times. They are then confused, distracted, mesmerized and irritated by this sloppy lieutenant who looks at worthless details and rants or even raves about anything but the crime at hand. And it works. These criminals are so self-centered that they find themselves decentered, even mentally scattered all over the landscape in a minute, especially when Columbo is de-structuring the very piece of evidence they have planted there to mislead the police. But no one misleads Columbo.The series as such deals with the top of the social top, the cream of the effete world in and around Hollywood. These people are rich to the point of drowning in their green backs, or drowning in the common accompaniment of these green backs that whisky, or should I say bourbon, is. They have cars that are as long as trains and homes that are as big as the castles of the crazy Prussian emperor Friedrich, or was it a Bavarian Duke or something like that? They live in a dream in which their own umbilical logic - which is pretty obtuse - is the law reigning over the world and is re-enforced by their propensity at calling the top politicians and making them sing the song of the death of Columbo, as if Columbo were a swan, in other words pressurizing if not blackmailing them.Of course he gets these perverse and twisted warped minds and bodies that carry the worst criminal instincts down and has his assistants put manacles generally in the form of handcuffs on them, at times in a considerate way (for women) in front, but most of the time (for men) behind their backs. And he hesitates in front of nothing at all. Down must the criminal go and down goes the criminal. Down with and from the mountain of social climbing, which is only a ladder and Columbo pushes that ladder down under their feet and enjoys the fall, like at the end of ""Jack and the Beanstalk.""These two seasons provides us with six stories that are all in that color and I will of course not even evoke the details. We know the criminal from the very start. We do not know the motives at times, and the motives might be even respectable when we get to them, but the end is the end and the show, in spite of what all actors say, must find an end and that end is in prison. So enjoy these six little big films of a series and let yourself be taken by the extremely good actor who is known all around the world as Columbo, and was imitated in France by the TV series ""Navarro"". But the actor is much better in the original.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,Don't stalk and enjoy,1329004800,"02 12, 2012",2012,4678,"['Columbo', 'legend', 'detective', 'series', 'was', 'often', 'imitated', 'never', 'equalled', 'was', 'also', 'parodied', 'dozen', 'other', 'sleuths', 'private', 'eyes', 'amateur', 'detectives', 'free-lance', 'bounty', 'hunters', 'Murder', 'Death', 'vain', 'way', 'meeting', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'was', 'more', 'funny.Columbo', 'brings', 'first', 'picture', 'old', 'French', 'car', '50s', 'Peugeot', 'mind', 'banged', 'up', 'scratched', 'possible', 'indecent', 'ways', 'can', 'fart', 'boom', 'when', 'surprise', 'necessary', 'door', 'not', 'open', 'when', 'most', 'irritating', 'not', 'open', 'irritating', 'audience', 'course', 'audience', 'room', 'audience', 'film', 'other', 'cops', 'criminals', 'who', 'are', 'irritated', 'sole', 'presence', 'Columbo', 'were', 'perambulating', 'poison', 'ivy', 'rest', 'assured', 'reluctant', 'door', 'planned', 'crafty', 'lieutenant.Then', 'inconsiderate', 'way', 'dressing', 'badly', 'trench', 'coat', 'coat', 'flasher', 'bum', 'homeless', 'beggar', 'shirt', 'never', 'very', 'pure', 'tie', 'everything', 'flashy', 'fact', 'sore', 'dull', 'hair', 'greyish', 'when', 'dyes', 'more', 'less', 'red', 'sake', 'case', 'disgusting', 'cigar', 'drops', 'ashes', 'everywhere', 'even', 'ugly', 'dog', 'time', 'time', 'big', 'metal', 'bowl', 'water', 'give', 'drink', 'when', 'crime', 'scene.He', 'wife', 'who', 'Arlesian', 'woman', 'eponymous', 'opera', 'Bizet', 'who', 'never', 'seen', 'always', 'spoken', 'permanent', 'reference', 'when', 'confuse', 'suspect', 'just', 'wonder', 'what', 'could', 'do', 'wife', 'who', 'apparently', 'originality', 'original', 'tastes', 'pure', 'virtual', 'embodiment', 'impersonation', 'most', 'middle', 'way', 'unoriginal', 'banal', 'middle', 'class', 'non-working', 'childless', 'housewife', 'can', 'imagine.The', 'best', 'part', 'Columbo', 'method', 'sloppy', 'sloppy', 'purpose', 'only', 'top', 'society', 'criminals', 'Beverley', 'Hills', 'mostly', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'know', 'very', 'well', 'pretend', 'are', 'best', 'most', 'organized', 'criminals', 'times', 'are', 'then', 'confused', 'distracted', 'mesmerized', 'irritated', 'sloppy', 'lieutenant', 'who', 'worthless', 'details', 'rants', 'even', 'raves', 'anything', 'crime', 'hand', 'criminals', 'are', 'so', 'self-centered', 'find', 'decentered', 'even', 'mentally', 'scattered', 'landscape', 'minute', 'especially', 'when', 'Columbo', 'de-structuring', 'very', 'piece', 'evidence', 'have', 'planted', 'there', 'mislead', 'police', 'one', 'Columbo.The', 'series', 'such', 'deals', 'top', 'social', 'top', 'cream', 'effete', 'world', 'Hollywood', 'people', 'are', 'rich', 'point', 'drowning', 'green', 'backs', 'drowning', 'common', 'accompaniment', 'green', 'backs', 'whisky', 'should', 'say', 'bourbon', 'have', 'cars', 'are', 'as', 'long', 'trains', 'homes', 'are', 'as', 'big', 'castles', 'crazy', 'Prussian', 'emperor', 'Friedrich', 'was', 'Bavarian', 'Duke', 'something', 'live', 'dream', 'own', 'umbilical', 'logic', 'pretty', 'law', 'reigning', 'world', 're-enforced', 'propensity', 'calling', 'top', 'politicians', 'making', 'sing', 'song', 'death', 'Columbo', 'Columbo', 'were', 'swan', 'other', 'words', 'pressurizing', 'not', 'blackmailing', 'them.Of', 'course', 'perverse', 'twisted', 'warped', 'minds', 'bodies', 'carry', 'worst', 'criminal', 'instincts', 'down', 'assistants', 'put', 'manacles', 'generally', 'form', 'handcuffs', 'times', 'considerate', 'way', 'women', 'front', 'most', 'time', 'men', 'backs', 'front', 'nothing', 'Down', 'must', 'criminal', 'go', 'down', 'criminal', 'mountain', 'social', 'climbing', 'only', 'ladder', 'Columbo', 'pushes', 'ladder', 'down', 'feet', 'fall', 'end', 'Jack', 'Beanstalk', 'two', 'seasons', 'six', 'stories', 'are', 'color', 'will', 'course', 'not', 'even', 'evoke', 'details', 'know', 'criminal', 'very', 'start', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'motives', 'times', 'motives', 'might', 'be', 'even', 'respectable', 'when', 'get', 'end', 'end', 'show', 'spite', 'what', 'actors', 'say', 'must', 'find', 'end', 'end', 'prison', 'So', 'enjoy', 'six', 'little', 'big', 'films', 'series', 'let', 'be', 'taken', 'extremely', 'good', 'actor', 'who', 'known', 'world', 'Columbo', 'was', 'imitated', 'France', 'TV', 'series', 'Navarro', 'actor', 'much', 'better', 'original.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",N/A
