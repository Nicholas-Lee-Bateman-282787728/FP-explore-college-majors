Villanueva,"[7, 15]","First let me clarify I adore Colin Firth and Julianne Moore, two actors so good that everyone recognizes their quality except Hollywood (see her in ""The Hours"").Second: if there has ever been a boy angel face on screen, it must be Nicholas Hoult's.Third, Firth and Hoult's bodies, as per Tom Ford's magisterial direction and caressing cinematography, have been immortalized as poetry in motion.And then: when grieving is almost over and love is about to reappear, the protagonist croaks! Romantically, but definitely.  Was it required by the literary source, like in ""Brokeback""?I was so angry. Both Ang Lee and Tom Ford are gay. Christopher Isherwood was gay--and had no guts, unlike E. M. Forster. If it is necessary to change the ending, do it!  Some of us live long, satisfying lives.  This movie could have been a 5 stars.  The professor should have risen--literally and metaphor-ically-- to the challenge posed by his adoring student.  A heart attack is a convenient soggy ending and a cop-out.The fault is Isherwood's--then, as a gay director I would not have chosen his material.And by the way, I'm buying the utterly mesmerizing musical score.

It's use of color and sets are stunning. I was afraid it would be too ""fashion magazine"" from what I had read about Ford's film but I have to say while it is all pretty pristine looking it never once takes away from the emotional heft of the film or the superb acting of the four main cast members.Firth, Moore, Goode, and Hoult all leave impressions on you in this film that will follow you around for days. Colin Firth plays George, a brokenhearted middle aged professor who still finds joy and warmth all around him. He clings to every flicker of happiness like a moth to a flame, and the film literally lights up every time George finds something to smile about. The problem is every time George finds something to be happy about it reminds him of Jim (Matthew Goode) who was a handsome young sailor who fell for the professor. Jim was prefect, at least as far as we see from George's point of view and with him gone what is the point of it all really?The Cuban Missile crisis rages in the background of this film but George has more important things to worry about. Namely, what he is still doing alive when his heart was ripped from him when Jim left. Julianne Moore plays Charley, a character that hints to George's life before he met Jim. Charley is a bitter Brit herself, with an ex-husband and a still simmering crush for George that dates back to London. The two of them have a complex and loving relationship, but does Charley Really understand what George feels inside? Does Kenny (Nicholas Hoult in a breakout performance) a rebellious gay college student who looks to The Professor for answers about his own mental issues and maybe more. Kenny lights up the film with youthful joy and enthusiasm that makes you, and George, wonder if life just might be worth living.It's hard to lock down a real plot to ""A Single Man"" in my opinion. If you were to explain it to a friend you could do so in 1 sentence and it would sound truly boring.

He does not disappoint although his talents are wasted in this poor movie. Firth is a Professor of English coming to terms with the death of his partner of 18 years against the backdrop of the Cuban Missile Crisis. Most of the action takes place on a single day, when Firth makes a plan to end his suffering. So during this day he has a host of sequences where he meets a lot of characters who add nothing substantial to the film and a dinner date with his long time friend Julianne Moore with a horrible English accent. Tom Ford the director is apparently a famous person but I had never heard of him until I saw the film.

1291482,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B002VECLVO,Andrew Ellington,"[5, 6]","Before I get into the reason for my review title, I want to start by saying that it is a plus and a negative.  What first time director Tom Ford brings to `A Single Man' plays both in its favor and to its disadvantage, at times simultaneously.The film itself, taking place in the 60's, tells of the tragic tale of grief.  One man, Professor George Falconer, loses his lover Jim in a tragic car accident.  George and Jim have been living with one another for sixteen years, and while their love affair was kept under wraps, it wasn't as if others had an inkling as to their situation.  The film opens after the accident, and it shows George coming to terms with the grief.  Taking place over a single day, George contemplates and then elaborately plans out his suicide.  In the meantime, he has a class to teach and a friend to entertain (well, she is entertaining him) and he also happens to catch the eye of a certain male student.What at times can be conceived as a one-note exploration of a single man's grief (the title of the film, in my opinion, is not referring to his current dating status but more or less refers to the fact that this is the story of ONE man) has flourishes of poignant depictions of that said grief, thanks in large part to the dynamic performance given by the films star, Colin Firth.Let's talk about Colin for a second.  Here is an actor who is largely remembered (if at all) for his romantic comedies.  I mean, he has shown that he could act in the past, but has he ever really done anything worthy of serious attention?  I think I remember being pleased with him in those `Bridget's Diary' movies, but in the end he was nothing spectacular.  Serviceable was a good word to use to describe Colin Firth.  What he does in `A Single Man' is far more than a mere `service'; he completely embodies this man and exudes ever possible emotional complexity with a mere glance.  What is so amazing here is that he internalizes so much, as apposed to simply wearing every emotion on his sleeve (as so many actors today assume is the best way to express grief).  Firth gives a delicate and quiet performance that really addresses the realness of George's situation.  Here is a man who has to suffer alone because no one can know what he is feeling.  He has to pretend, but pretending is difficult, and if he must pretend then he would rather die.  What amazed me about the performance was that Firth allowed George to forget his grief in split second moments that presented the reality of his world.  He would forget and then remember and you could almost see the self-loathing written on George's face as he internally hated himself for allowing himself to smile.Fantastic performance.Now, onto the window dressing.The film itself is beautiful.  It looks stunning and it sounds stunning (that score is superb) and so your senses are enriched with nearly every scene.  The contrast used of black and white, sepia and flourishes of color on the frames is a nice trick and a beautiful one at that.  The idea of muting words and sounds and allowing us to hear the clarity within George's skull was an interesting idea.  All of it, apart from one another, is marvelously conceived but together it begins to overtake the film.  I remember when the trailer for the film was released.  It was the prettiest trailer I had ever scene.  The music, the editing, the set pieces, the fashion, the emotional relevance; it all spoke so fluidly to the audience.  Sadly, the film itself feels like an overly long movie trailer.  It just doesn't have the rawness (outside of Firth) to elevate it past that.That said, other elements of the film (especially Matthew Goode's underrated performance and subsequent chemistry with Firth) were strong, and the overall impact of the film (thanks to Firth) hits you where it counts, even if the ending was a tad underwhelming (I say ""cop out"").  It is a promising directorial debut (Ford, a fashion designer, knows how to make pretty pictures) that boasts one of the best performances of the decade; easy.",4,Window dressing...,1288310400,"10 29, 2010",2010,4046,"['get', 'reason', 'review', 'title', 'want', 'start', 'saying', 'plus', 'negative', 'What', 'first', 'time', 'director', 'Tom', 'Ford', 'Single', 'Man', 'plays', 'favor', 'disadvantage', 'times', 'simultaneously.The', 'film', 'taking', 'place', '60', 'tells', 'tragic', 'tale', 'grief', 'One', 'man', 'Professor', 'George', 'Falconer', 'lover', 'Jim', 'tragic', 'car', 'accident', 'George', 'Jim', 'have', 'been', 'living', 'one', 'sixteen', 'years', 'love', 'affair', 'was', 'kept', 'wraps', 'was', ""n't"", 'others', 'had', 'inkling', 'situation', 'film', 'accident', 'George', 'coming', 'terms', 'grief', 'Taking', 'place', 'single', 'day', 'George', 'contemplates', 'then', 'elaborately', 'out', 'suicide', 'meantime', 'class', 'teach', 'friend', 'entertain', 'well', 'entertaining', 'also', 'catch', 'eye', 'certain', 'male', 'student.What', 'times', 'can', 'be', 'conceived', 'one-note', 'exploration', 'single', 'man', 'grief', 'title', 'film', 'opinion', 'not', 'referring', 'current', 'dating', 'status', 'more', 'less', 'refers', 'fact', 'story', 'ONE', 'man', 'flourishes', 'poignant', 'depictions', 'said', 'grief', 'thanks', 'large', 'part', 'dynamic', 'performance', 'given', 'films', 'star', 'Colin', 'Firth.Let', 'talk', 'Colin', 'second', 'Here', 'actor', 'who', 'largely', 'remembered', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'mean', 'shown', 'could', 'act', 'past', 'ever', 'really', 'done', 'anything', 'worthy', 'serious', 'attention', 'think', 'remember', 'being', 'pleased', 'Bridget', 'Diary', 'movies', 'end', 'was', 'nothing', 'spectacular', 'Serviceable', 'was', 'good', 'word', 'use', 'describe', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'What', 'Single', 'Man', 'far', 'more', 'mere', 'service', 'completely', 'man', 'ever', 'possible', 'emotional', 'complexity', 'mere', 'glance', 'What', 'so', 'amazing', 'here', 'so', 'much', 'apposed', 'simply', 'wearing', 'emotion', 'sleeve', 'so', 'many', 'actors', 'today', 'assume', 'best', 'way', 'express', 'grief', 'Firth', 'delicate', 'quiet', 'performance', 'really', 'realness', 'George', 'situation', 'Here', 'man', 'who', 'suffer', 'alone', 'one', 'can', 'know', 'what', 'feeling', 'pretend', 'pretending', 'difficult', 'must', 'pretend', 'then', 'would', 'rather', 'die', 'What', 'amazed', 'performance', 'was', 'Firth', 'allowed', 'George', 'forget', 'grief', 'split', 'second', 'moments', 'presented', 'reality', 'world', 'would', 'forget', 'then', 'remember', 'could', 'almost', 'see', 'self-loathing', 'written', 'George', 'face', 'internally', 'hated', 'allowing', 'smile.Fantastic', 'performance.Now', 'window', 'dressing.The', 'film', 'beautiful', 'stunning', 'stunning', 'score', 'superb', 'so', 'senses', 'are', 'enriched', 'nearly', 'scene', 'contrast', 'used', 'black', 'white', 'sepia', 'flourishes', 'color', 'frames', 'nice', 'trick', 'beautiful', 'one', 'idea', 'muting', 'words', 'sounds', 'allowing', 'hear', 'clarity', 'George', 'skull', 'was', 'interesting', 'idea', 'apart', 'one', 'marvelously', 'conceived', 'together', 'overtake', 'film', 'remember', 'when', 'trailer', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'was', 'prettiest', 'trailer', 'had', 'ever', 'scene', 'music', 'editing', 'set', 'pieces', 'fashion', 'emotional', 'relevance', 'spoke', 'so', 'fluidly', 'audience', 'Sadly', 'film', 'overly', 'long', 'movie', 'trailer', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'rawness', 'Firth', 'elevate', 'that.That', 'said', 'other', 'elements', 'film', 'especially', 'Matthew', 'Goode', 'underrated', 'performance', 'subsequent', 'chemistry', 'Firth', 'were', 'strong', 'overall', 'impact', 'film', 'thanks', 'Firth', 'where', 'even', 'ending', 'was', 'tad', 'underwhelming', 'say', 'cop', 'out', 'promising', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Ford', 'fashion', 'designer', 'how', 'make', 'pretty', 'pictures', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'decade', 'easy']",N/A

1291484,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B002VECLVO,Andy Orrock,"[2, 3]","Colin Firth just scored a well-deserved Oscar forThe King's Speech. It should have been the back-half of a Hanksian double.  He was even better in Tom Ford's 'A Single Man.'The 'single' in the film's title has double meaning: not only is Firth's character bereft by the death of his partner, in time and place he's not allowed to experience his grief with anyone.  A phone call from his partner's cousin (voiced by Jon Hamm!) tells Firth's George of the tragedy.  But the caller also informs George that the services are 'family only.' That Firth isn't considered family is clear by inference.  Though it's clear that the caller sympathizes with George, he also makes clear that this is an unofficial call made unbeknownst to immediate family.  From there, we watch as George - life abruptly untethered - slowly unravels.  Julianne Moore - so different from herThe Kids Are All Rightrole - is excellent as Firth's one true friend.  It's not a straightforward friendship - Moore's character is a handful - but it's the one thing that George has to lean on.To the film industry's surprise, designer Tom Ford got this film done and done so well.  Ford got scads of looks askance and eyerolls in Hollywood when he announced he wanted to try his hand at filmmaking.  By all accounts, it was an arduous trail to the screen. Ultimately, this creative talent could not be denied.That Ford cares about look and can create effectively in a visual medium shouldn't come as a shock.  Every frame of the film bears the imprint of his careful and inventive eye.  It's a beautiful film.  What does surprise is Ford's ability to attract Grade A talent to this freshman effort and his focus on narrative.

1291486,A9Y947FCJZPVL,B002VECLVO,Arcadio Bolaos,"[3, 3]","It's your last day. What would you do? For professor George Falconer the answer is easy: retrieving important documents, closing bank accounts, writing letters to his friends as well as his last will. With unflinching actions and melancholic gestures, Colin Firth creates a most enthralling character, imbued by the sheer emotion of loss and yet adjusted to the repressed feelings he considers necessary to suppress even in his last day. After losing his partner and lover, there is no deterrence in his decision: he will kill himself at the end of the day.How then could he spend his last 24 hours? Many would have extravagant and unordinary ideas, but the truth is that George Falconer upholds his daily routine facing this day as any other. He wakes up, takes a shower, gets dressed, drives to university, teaches his last class and decides to join his old friend Charlie (amazingly interpreted by Julianne Moore) for supper. Tom Ford's remarkable film takes Christopher Isherwood's novel and turns it into a tour de force in which emotions and the human condition are on full display.Everything seems different when you realize you are watching things for the last time. And so George finally lets go, acting and speaking to people in ways he had not even considered before. Through constant flashbacks, the viewer catches a few glances of the relationship George had with Jim. They had been together for 16 years and if not for a fatal accident they would still be together. Can life lose all meaning once we lost our loved ones? It certainly would seem like it; George finds himself not only disgruntled but also devoid of any hope. He dreads tomorrow. And why should he inflict himself with the torture of existing, day after day, if existence has proved to be so painful and dire? Some answers can be found in Slavoj Zizek and Jacques Lacan theories; more specifically in the notions of real and symbolic death. Evidently, we will suffer a biological death in which our bodies will fail and eventually disintegrate, that's what happens with Jim. This death occurs in the Real, and it entails the obliteration of our material selves. But we can also suffer a Symbolic death that has nothing to do with the annihilation of our actual bodies, but rather the destruction of our Symbolic universe and the extermination of our subject positions. Whenever people remember our names, remember our deeds and so on we continue to exist in the Symbolic even though we have died in the Real. Therefore, Jim is not truly dead as George remembers him constantly, but here evocation does not provide the necessary narrative of closure, the grieving process remains incomplete.There is a fissure that separates the two deaths which can be filled either by manifestations of the monstrous or the beautiful. A concept that a Spanish hustler rescues during a conversation with the professor ""Sometimes awful things have their own kind of beauty"". That is why the presence of Kenny, Nicholas Hoult's character, is of supreme importance. He is not only the embodiment of beauty but he also provides the companionship George so urgently needs. Only through Kenny and the bonding they start developing will George experience an epiphany (""A few times in my life I've had moments of absolute clarity, when for a few brief seconds the silence drowns out the noise and I can feel rather than think, and things seem so sharp and the world seems so fresh""). A revelation in which he will understand why is it important to let go of the past, to put the pain away and to take a real risk: to accept life and keep on living.",5,Life and Symbolic Death,1317686400,"10 4, 2011",2011,3602,"['last', 'day', 'What', 'would', 'do', 'professor', 'George', 'Falconer', 'answer', 'easy', 'retrieving', 'important', 'documents', 'closing', 'bank', 'accounts', 'writing', 'letters', 'friends', 'as', 'well', 'last', 'will', 'unflinching', 'actions', 'melancholic', 'gestures', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'most', 'enthralling', 'character', 'imbued', 'sheer', 'emotion', 'loss', 'yet', 'adjusted', 'repressed', 'feelings', 'necessary', 'suppress', 'even', 'last', 'day', 'losing', 'partner', 'lover', 'deterrence', 'decision', 'will', 'kill', 'end', 'day.How', 'then', 'could', 'spend', 'last', '24', 'hours', 'Many', 'would', 'have', 'extravagant', 'unordinary', 'ideas', 'truth', 'George', 'Falconer', 'daily', 'routine', 'facing', 'day', 'other', 'up', 'shower', 'dressed', 'university', 'last', 'class', 'decides', 'join', 'old', 'friend', 'Charlie', 'amazingly', 'interpreted', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'supper', 'Tom', 'Ford', 'remarkable', 'film', 'Christopher', 'Isherwood', 'novel', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'emotions', 'human', 'condition', 'are', 'full', 'display.Everything', 'different', 'when', 'realize', 'are', 'watching', 'things', 'last', 'time', 'so', 'George', 'finally', 'go', 'acting', 'speaking', 'people', 'ways', 'had', 'not', 'even', 'considered', 'constant', 'flashbacks', 'viewer', 'few', 'glances', 'relationship', 'George', 'had', 'Jim', 'had', 'been', 'together', '16', 'years', 'not', 'fatal', 'accident', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'together', 'Can', 'life', 'lose', 'meaning', 'lost', 'loved', 'ones', 'certainly', 'would', 'seem', 'George', 'not', 'only', 'disgruntled', 'also', 'devoid', 'hope', 'tomorrow', 'why', 'should', 'inflict', 'torture', 'existing', 'day', 'day', 'existence', 'proved', 'be', 'so', 'painful', 'dire', 'answers', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'Slavoj', 'Zizek', 'Jacques', 'Lacan', 'theories', 'more', 'specifically', 'notions', 'real', 'symbolic', 'death', 'Evidently', 'will', 'suffer', 'biological', 'death', 'bodies', 'will', 'fail', 'eventually', 'disintegrate', 'what', 'Jim', 'death', 'Real', 'obliteration', 'material', 'selves', 'can', 'also', 'suffer', 'Symbolic', 'death', 'nothing', 'do', 'annihilation', 'actual', 'bodies', 'rather', 'destruction', 'Symbolic', 'universe', 'extermination', 'subject', 'positions', 'Whenever', 'people', 'remember', 'names', 'remember', 'deeds', 'so', 'continue', 'exist', 'Symbolic', 'even', 'have', 'died', 'Real', 'Therefore', 'Jim', 'not', 'truly', 'dead', 'George', 'constantly', 'here', 'evocation', 'not', 'provide', 'necessary', 'narrative', 'closure', 'grieving', 'process', 'fissure', 'two', 'deaths', 'can', 'be', 'filled', 'either', 'manifestations', 'monstrous', 'beautiful', 'concept', 'Spanish', 'hustler', 'rescues', 'conversation', 'professor', 'Sometimes', 'awful', 'things', 'have', 'own', 'kind', 'beauty', 'why', 'presence', 'Kenny', 'Nicholas', 'Hoult', 'character', 'supreme', 'importance', 'not', 'only', 'embodiment', 'beauty', 'also', 'companionship', 'George', 'so', 'urgently', 'Only', 'Kenny', 'bonding', 'start', 'developing', 'will', 'George', 'experience', 'epiphany', 'few', 'times', 'life', ""'ve"", 'had', 'moments', 'absolute', 'clarity', 'when', 'few', 'brief', 'silence', 'out', 'noise', 'can', 'feel', 'rather', 'think', 'things', 'seem', 'so', 'sharp', 'world', 'so', 'fresh', 'revelation', 'will', 'understand', 'why', 'important', 'let', 'go', 'past', 'put', 'pain', 'away', 'take', 'real', 'risk', 'accept', 'life', 'keep', 'living']",N/A

1291488,AGGJUO2375PTG,B002VECLVO,Beluomo,"[2, 2]","I  purchased this movie not only because it is based on one of the wonderful stories by Christopher Isherwood, but also because it is inconceivable to me that any movie starring Colin Firth and Julianne Moore could be anything less than superb. I was not disappointed.Colin Firth plays a Gay college professor who has lost his partner very tragically after a  strong and beautiful 16 year relationship.  His insurmountable grief is captured in the intermittent flashbacks chronicling his relationship.  His agony is exacerbated by the fact he that he only found out about his partner's death because of the kindness of a stranger who felt a moral obligation to call him and apprise him of the tragic event.His lover's family obviously did not recognize or validate their partnership, as he was told that the funeral services are for ""family only"".He then plans to commit suicide for lack of any purpose in his life.  But thanks to an endearing friendship with Julianne Moore, and a sweet, beautiful college student who sees his pain, empathizes with him, and forms a special bond with him, the dirty deed is put on hold at least for now.This unselfish and caring young man seems willing to do whatever is necessary to help heal this broken man, even with physical intimacy if things were to go there, but the endearing non-sexual bond they share supersedes any sexual needs they have, so there is no consummation otherwise.When the young man finally spends the night at Firth's home, he sleeps on the couch with Firth's gun next to him.  After finding the gun in a drawer, he wants to ensure that Firth doesn't use it on himself.  Will he be be successful???This is real substance here brought to you by a great filmmaker, Tom Ford.

1291489,A30TQET02FLSUX,B002VECLVO,BLACKBOXBLUE,"[6, 6]","This film has left an impression on my heart and in my mind so powerfully that it intimidates me to even write about it for fear of detracting from the greatness of the movie. I saw director Tom Ford's debut masterpiece A Single Man (2009) for the first time the day it was released on DVD (July 6, 2010). I was anxiously awaiting it since I first heard about it last year and saw the trailer. I'm a huge admirer of Fashion Designer Tom Ford and when I heard he had made his first film as a director, I just knew I wanted to SEE his movie no matter what because I knew that a guy with that much style and slick image would have to create a visually stunning movie. And of course he did!A Single Man was filmed poetically on an old Kodak film stock that Ford and Director of Photography Eduard Grau bought the final spools of wherever they could find them around the world. That passion and craft for making this film shows in every single grainy frame of the movie from when you press play until the final credit. I'm always blogging about how visually stunning many movies are...but this one truly represents how I personally see the world and its beauty...in somber and subtle poetic detail. I find beauty in the simple details like the character George does in this movie, played astonishingly by actor Colin Firth. This is one movie where all the still images I share still don't do the film justice. You just have to see this film to revel in its incredible visual beauty. Ford's use of heavy grain from the film stock works perfectly to help convey the old school 1962 time period in which this film takes place. I bought the bluray version of the movie and it's one of those rare new movies where ""high definition"" doesn't really improve the movie. This movie is all about what 35mm film is to cinema, like vinyl records are to music. The perfections and imperfections are what make it great.If you've read anything about the story of this movie, then you know it's a serious character-driven drama...my favorite kind of movie. This movie is for people who truly appreciate the power and ability of cinema to capture the human condition and its thoughts and emotions. It's not a ""feel good"" movie, and yet it made me feel alive and good about film. This is a story about lost love. Colin Firth plays George, a gay English Professor in his late 40s or 50s, who loses the love of his life, Jim, played beautifully by Matthew Goode. The movie is a day in the life of George as he prepares to kill himself at the end of it. His heart is so broken that he's lost hope and his drive to live. And yet on the final day of his life, he rediscovers a passion for living through the people he interacts with, like student Kenny (played by Nicholas Hoult) and best friend Charley (played stunningly by Julianne Moore). And he rediscovers the beauty and color in the details of his life and the world around him. I won't give away the ending, but I'll tell you that it is not what I expected...and yet it seemed perfectly expected after seeing it.The production design for this film is perfect. From the sets and locations to the costumes and props, everything was perfectly chosen by Ford and his team of craftsmen. I just love George's black eyeglasses and his impeccable clothing. The house that George lives in is a beautiful piece of mid-century modern architecture combining both simplicity and warmth. Of course George's partner Jim was an architect, as the movies are so fond of using as a profession for characters. As an Architect, I will admit that I love the admiration the movies have for architects...and a part of me always lights up when I hear or see someone playing an architect in a film.After watching A Single Man back on July 6, I immediately bought it on bluray the next day, along with the soundtrack from iTunes. I instantly knew this film belonged not only in my movie and music collections but in my Top 100 movies of all time. Music Composers Abel Korzeniowski and Shigeru Umebayashi crafted the most incredible poetic soundtrack for this film. The opening credit sequence starts with the song ""Drowning"", which is an eery orchestral piece that's perfectly accompanied to the naked underwater images of Colin Firth ""drowning"". But the first song of the soundtrack titled ""Stillness of the Mind"", is the music that makes my soul weep every time I hear it. The violin solo and backing orchestra are so tender and emotional in their playing of this lovingly crafted piece of music. It just pulls feeling out of its listeners and makes them pay attention to both the joy and sadness within themselves. This soundtrack was grossly overlooked by the Academy...it should have been nominated for an Oscar for Best Music (Original Score).To be honest, this movie was grossly overlooked in several categories by the Oscars, except for Colin Firth's nomination for Best Actor. A Single Man should have been nominated for Art Direction, Cinematography, and Editing as well.  I think the main reason this film was overlooked by the Academy is the same reason it was overlooked by the public. On the surface, it's a ""gay"" movie about a gay man and was directed by a gay man. And yet this movie has nothing really to do with sex. It could as easily be told about a straight man. It's simply a story about lost love. But mainstream America is still unable to see past things that appear to be gay or have a gay feel to them, and A Single Man is simply a victim of that bias. But I have a feeling this film will stand the test of time and that people will discover it and appreciate it over the years to come. And whatever next film Tom Ford makes will surely pull more fans into his work who'll discover this treasure as well. I for one am extremely anxious to see what masterpiece Ford crafts for his second feature film. His debut was brilliant and will be hard to live up to. But if anyone can do it, Tom Ford seems to be the man. He's a perfectionist like myself and simply won't settle for much less. He's switched from focusing on fashion to film as his passion, which he has said is where he can express himself more fully. And ironically, he was trained as an architect like myself. This film was built like an architect would build it.",4,In my Top 100 Movies of All Time,1286236800,"10 5, 2010",2010,6250,"['film', 'left', 'impression', 'heart', 'mind', 'so', 'powerfully', 'even',

Tom Ford's first effort is superb. Loved the film and the soundtrack. Bought it on iTunes when I got home from seeing the film at the Harvard Exit Theater in Seattle. This is my favorite Colin Firth film, and I was very pleased he was nominated for the Oscar. I can see why it went to Jeff Bridges, has nothing to do with his performance being better than Colin's. That's not how the Oscar's work. Two different styles of films, two wonderful performances from leading men. Hollywood executives ""market"" for awards. Colin attended the Oscar hype events looking dashing and his wife looking beautiful.

Tom Ford, the director and designer, and Colin Firth, the actor heretofore almost known exclusively as Jane Austen's or Helen Fielding's Darcy. Fifteen years later, he is finally able to break the Darcy mold constricting him, breaking out as a gay, bereaved lover, a professor from the UK who teaches in 1962 California. His longtime lover and companion of sixteen years was killed in a car accident.  He is excluded from all but a phone call in the grieving process. Stuck with grieving and mourning alone, he verges from the suicidal to the reawakening.  It is a wonderful characterization, nuanced with every layer one could hope for in cinema. Ford's artistic sensibility invades every frame.  There is an extremely tactile, lush, visual beauty to the whole film coupled with an artist's way of seeing.

Firth does an excellent job of subtle character development as he plays a man overcome with grief to the point that he has become numb.  But it is more than this for it is about the forces that pull us into death to join those that have gone before us and the beautiful forces of life that pull us toward life, to keep going for anther day to enjoy the gift of existence. It is the story of an English professor in a community college in the 1960s who is trying to get through another day as his memory takes him back to conversations and intimacy with his deceased lover, Jim. Jim, played by Matthew Goode, was his partner for many years, and now, left alone, the title ""A Single Man"" has multiple meanings.  George Falconer is still connected to the world, as evidenced by his friendship with Charley, an old girlfriend, who has become a confidant.  Julianne Moore is great in this role. The character of George Falconer may be fearful of isolation and a solitary existence but he is also resistant to the attractions of the world, fully evident in the character of Kenny, a beautiful sensitive young student from one of his classes. Nicholas Hoult plays Kenny and it is not just Kenny's beauty that retains George's interest but the desire on the part of Kenny for insightful and meaningful interactions with a like minded soul. In fact the film shows George propositioned by a beautiful and yet vulnerable male hustler outside a liquor store. Worldly beauty doesn't pull him back from the brink. It is Kenny's more nuanced and meaningful overtures that act as a lifeline to a drowning man. This is a film for adults. Colin Firth's portrayal of George is one of loss, and disorienting grief, covered over with rituals of control and order. He has the exceptional ability to be coolly handsome while revealing a boiling undercurrent just below his surface. Nicholas Hoult is also excellent, first appearing as an appealing young man in the classroom, but revealing more depth and desire of meaningful interaction with each scene. Julianne Moore, playing an isolated divorcee, plays one of those wonderful friends who is supportive and kind and still may have an unrevealed agenda. She plays the part well. The film is based on Christopher Isherwood's novel of the same name, but be aware that changes have been made, and the film should be judged on its own merits since it has significantly adapted parts of the novel, including the ending.

1291499,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B002VECLVO,Chris Pandolfi,"[280, 293]","George Falconer (Colin Firth), a British literature professor living in Los Angeles in 1962, is struggling to find meaning in his life. That's an awfully generic way to start a movie review, and I agree that many movies are about the struggle for meaning in life. But in the case of ""A Single Man,"" an adaptation of Christopher Isherwood's novel, the idea seems neither hackneyed nor overused; we follow George over the course of one day and actually see and respond to his struggle to find meaning. Ever since a car accident took the life of Jim, his lover of sixteen years (Matthew Goode), George has been on a desperate search for some degree of contentment, some sign that he can love again and will be loved in return. He hasn't found it yet. He may never again find it. So why not make use of the gun in the desk drawer?This film marks the directorial debut of Tom Ford, the fashion designer and former creative director of the Gucci house. It would be brilliant even if it had been his twentieth film. It's a story of astonishing observation and poignancy, where beauty is found not only in the form of a face or the arc of an eyebrow, but also in the cold bleakness of a winter road, where pain and death give way to encounters of surprising tenderness. It's a masterpiece of character development and performance; every one of George's onscreen appearances, for example, is an opportunity for Ford to reveal him to us, which is to say we never see him in an empty or extraneous moment. The dialogue is a perfect blend of insight, contemplation, and wit - one of those rare instances where every word is carefully placed yet strung together as naturally as regular conversation.George is far from an uptight, prissy clich&eacute;, although he does give the appearance of being neat and orderly; always nicely dressed, always articulate, always able to keep his things in their proper place. But within, he's an absolute mess, tormented by grief, loss, regret, and above all, fear - the fear of isolation, of growing old alone and forgotten. He finds some solace with his best friend and former lover, Charlotte, a.k.a. Charley (Julianne Moore), an aging, hard-drinking British beauty who seems determined to wallow in her failures as a wife and mother. She states at one point that, as wonderful as what George and Jim had was, it was probably just a substitute for something real. George asserts, with understandable frustration, that what he and Jim had was very much real and not a substitute for anything.As the film progresses, a relationship develops between George and one of his students, Kenny (Nicholas Hoult), who appears, at first glance, to be nothing more than an infatuated youth. But this would be a tedious movie indeed if their interactions were entirely motivated by sex; there's a definite physical attraction, no question, but ultimately, what they share boils down to the innate desire for meaningful human interaction, which works on a frequency separate from sexual orientation. Kenny, though young, is remarkably insightful and may in fact be the key to George's emotional salvation.While symbolism is hardly new in the movies, specific images in ""A Single Man"" so thoroughly represent the main character's emotional turmoil that they cannot be dismissed as manipulative visual aids. Consider the use of clocks and watches, many ticking in unison with the sound of a beating heart; they tell time, something we're all caught up in and will eventually fall victim to. The second hand continuously moves in jerky motions, as if to reinforce the idea that George's life has been reduced to a countdown.Also consider the use of color. George's memories of Jim - which pop up randomly, as they tend to do in real life - are vibrant and lush, warm and inviting, evocative of a committed, loving relationship. Compare that to the world George now sees: Faded and gray, cold and lifeless, dull and dreary. There are select moments, however, when the colors visibly amplify, as when he has a conversation with his neighbor's pleasant young daughter while waiting at the bank. As is the case with Kenny, this little girl gives George a much needed dose of social interaction.In spite of George's orientation, ""A Single Man"" is not, as some would call it, a ""gay"" movie. Its focus is on humanity, not sexuality, and that makes it accessible, I believe, to all audiences; it reaffirms that within all of us is the need to make contact with other people, sometimes for love, sometimes for a shoulder to cry on, sometimes for nothing more than simple conversation. Of all the films I've seen this year, few have been this relatable, this touching, and even in the absence of big-budget visual effects, this visually creative. Its greatest achievement, perhaps, was the casting of Colin Firth, undeniably convincing as a broken man maintaining a faade of serenity and togetherness. This is one of the year's best films.",5,Looking for Color in a Bleak World,1261526400,"12 23, 2009",2009,4937,"['George', 'Falconer', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'British', 'literature', 'professor', 'living',

Colin Firth has stepped away from his typical romantic comedies and dove into a film, very much deserving of its Oscar nomination. He plays George - a man who is having trouble getting over the death of his lover Jim (Mathew Goode).There are a lot of times when you see an actor play a role, and you think they did a good job or maybe even an excellent job. But it's far rarer of an occasion, to find yourself honestly believing that this part was specifically meant for them, and that no-one could have played it any better. Colin Firth does exactly that for me, as George.He never really flips out in anger over the fact he's lost his love, nor does he seem to dwell on it emotionally, to the point of crying or breaking down. It's simply there behind his eyes in every scene.I particularly enjoyed the scene where he uses his relationship and the fact that he is a gay man in a society that hasn't quite accepted that yet (the 60s), as a metaphor to his students in one of his classes. Most of them don't catch onto this at all, but one does. Kenny (Nicholas Hoult), feeling trapped with his identity as well, sees this in George and is quick to act on it.The two of them have amazing chemistry together. While it's not what floats my boat, it's interesting to watch them interact without being too forward, for fear of scaring the other off. The film doesn't beat it out of them, but I think it's safe to say by its end, they have taught each other a thing or two about one another.SPOILER ALERT: Keep an eye out while watching the scenes with Kenny. The film never reveals this to us, but I got the feeling that it could be taken that Kenny is a figment of George's imagination. It just seems odd that we never see him interact with anyone else in the film, except for a girl he sits next to in class. Their quick conversation could have also been in George's mind. Who knows, it could be in my mind.Julianne Moore was robbed of an Oscar nomination as George's best friend Charley. She's a woman who, like George, left England long ago, and often fantasizes of going back. The two now live in Los Angeles and are both insanely lonely. Charley wants there to be more to their relationship for sure, but that's just not going to happen.We meet George's lover Jim, in a series of flashbacks throughout the film. It serves much better seeing him this way, versus perhaps having spent the first act with him, and then having him die. Their scenes aren't cheesy and aren't in your face with the gay, so you can relax, if this bothers you.Overall, the film wasn't great, but it was pretty darn good.

1291504,A1AYEI2SNFPYES,B002VECLVO,Dogville,"[6, 6]","So much has been written of A Single Man.The film is brilliant, as a directorial debut for Tom Ford and a star acting vehicle for Colin Firth.Tom Ford found his niche for A Single Man can almost qualify for a non-mainstream art house movie with its splendid shots, flashbacks and occasionally black-and-white retellings. Notwithstanding the fact that there were several model-quality actors in a few scenes, the casting was impeccable, Colin Firth as the emotionally-wrecked George Falconer putting on a false front living his day mourning for his dead lover; a vulnerable and empty Julianne Moore as Charly and Nicholas Hoult as a seemingly precocious youth tempting his professor.The screen adaptation was well-written. The book, as I have read it, was ponderous at times. It would have been a great challenge to move it to screen since much of the film relied on the strength of its cast and in this case, the marriage of screenplay and acting prowess was sweet. The film depended mostly on Colin Firth, his facial expressions, sometimes almost stoic, still betrayed a sense of neediness, something his young student picked up almost readily. His long-time best pal, once ex-lover, Charly, is a middle-aged woman who's bent on refusing to pick up the pieces of a broken marriage and a grown-up child, choosing to wallow in self-pity while still somewhat pining for the lost love she had with George. In that, Julianne Moore's screen time brings out the best performance in Firth. For that, Julianne Moore is no longer acting. She just is Charly (see her in a 10-min turn in The Secret Life of Pippa Lee). And I will certainly say that she is as good as my other favourite, Meryl Streep.The dialog is memorable and gripping. Jim said while on the couch chilling with George, ""If I die now, I'd be happy."" How many of us think of such simple pleasures in life, just being next to the person we love? I think.The film is ultimately all about living a life of love, loss and hope.""The few times in my life I've had moments of absolute clarity, when for a few brief seconds the silence drowns out the noise and I can feel rather than think, and things seem so sharp and the world seems so fresh. I can never make these moments last. I cling to them, but like everything, they fade. I have lived my life on these moments. They pull me back to the present, and I realize that everything is exactly the way it was meant to be.

1291506,A2BRZDMSGCYIKN,B002VECLVO,Dr. D,"[2, 2]","""A Single Man"" is one of the best pieces of dramatic art I've ever seen on the silver screen.  Major kudos to director Tom Ford for bringing out the hauntingly poetic and deeply emotional scenes that are peppered throughout this film.Simply put, the overarching plot theme is one of lament over the loss of a loved one and how one copes with that loss.  During the lamenting and grieving process, the individual (George Falconer, portrayed by Colin Firth) comes across experiences that not only pose a challenge to his own grieving process, but also give him reason to continue living life to its fullest.  Evident in this film are discussions of extremely philosophical issues such as life and death, fear, friendship, intimacy (both male-female AND male-male), and love.I've watched ""A Single Man"" twice so far, and the second time was better than first.  There are scenes in this film where George has these intense discussions with a few of the characters, and you're left on the edge of your seat with that feeling of ""will he do it?  will he?!  what's going through their minds?!""  It's just GREAT.  The element of dramatic pause is also used extensively in this film, and it really hits the mark with increased on-screen tension.  As for Colin Firth, THIS was the role that he should have won the Best Actor Academy Award for, not King George in ""The King's Speech""!  The scene where he receives the phone call that his lover died was enough to literally hand him that Oscar.  Thankfully, he did get his rightfully deserved Academy Award, but I think it came a little late for him.  Also, this film was snubbed from the Best Picture category, and I think it should have received a nomination at the very least.

1291508,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B002VECLVO,Ed Uyeshima,"[6, 12]","There is an aching rawness at the core of this handsome 2009 drama which marks the feature film directorial and screenwriting debut of renowned fashion designer Tom Ford. As one would expect, the film carries a pronounced aesthetic identity from someone who obviously has an eye for frame composition, visual flair and period detail. At the same time, Ford's preoccupation with the visual elements can get disruptive as he unnecessarily punctuates scenes with exaggerated changes in the film's color palate. Fortunately, what grounds the production is the sensitive work of the ever-dependable Colin Firth (Pride and Prejudice), who plays George Falconer, a 52-year-old college professor struggling to cope after the death of his longtime partner. The actor skillfully brings the pained nuance out of a protective character caught in an emotional straitjacket due to the repressed year that was 1962 when the story takes place.Based on the 1964 novel by Christopher Isherwood (Goodbye to Berlin), this is a somber tale of what George is planning to be his last day alive. Jim, his partner of sixteen years, died several months earlier in a car accident, and George just cannot move on with his life. Resigned to his fate, he spends the day going through the details of getting everything in order to ensure no one has to pick up after him. George cleans out his office, empties his safety deposit box, arranges his clothes neatly, and prepares to send farewell letters to his circle of friends. As he draws closer to what he expects to be his final moments, he becomes more immersed in memories of his past with Jim. However, two flesh-and-blood people figure prominently that day - his best friend Charley, an aging alcoholic socialite with whom he made a long-ago attempt at a fling, and a smitten student named Kenny, who appears to be grappling with his sexual identity through his obvious but inarticulate attraction to George.Firth holds the film together with a genuinely thoughtful performance. You can sense the tortuous anxiety and resigned complacency that he brings to every scene, but none of it overwhelms the character or the viewer. Take note of the way Firth economically handles the heartbreaking scene when George finds out over the phone that Jim has died. Obviously crestfallen, George maintains his composure as he is told that he is not invited to the funeral. Stuck in a mid-century time warp of her own doing (Far From Heaven,Savage Grace), Julianne Moore still manages to impress in her relatively brief scenes as Charley, bantering with George over gulps of gin in that recognizable balance between knowing indifference and unrequited romanticism. Nicholas Hoult (About a Boy) projects Kenny's eagerness a bit too easily, but he manages to convey the right level of vulnerability otherwise. Matthew Goode (Watchmen) plays Jim in idealized flashbacks, while Spanish model Jon Kortajarena smolders appropriately as a down-on-his-luck hustler George meets in a liquor store parking lot. Ginnifer Goodwin (Big Love) and Lee Pace (Pushing Daisies) show up in brief cameos. Spanish cinematographer Eduard Grau manages to capture all the varying, Almod&oacute;var-level moods that Ford obviously wants to convey, even if the neophyte filmmaker sometimes goes overboard with his approach.",4,A Sexually Repressed Man Portrayed Skillfully by Firth and Directed Stylistically by Tom Ford,1261958400,"12 28, 2009",2009,3307,"['aching', 'rawness', 'core', 'handsome', '2009', 'drama', 'feature', 'film', 'directorial', 'screenwriting', 'debut', 'renowned', 'fashion', 'designer', 'Tom', 'Ford', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'film', 'pronounced', 'aesthetic', 'identity', 'someone', 'who', 'obviously', 'eye', 'frame', 'composition', 'visual', 'flair', 'period', 'detail', 'same', 'time', 'Ford', 'preoccupation', 'visual', 'elements', 'can', 'get', 'disruptive', 'unnecessarily', 'scenes', 'exaggerated', 'changes', 'film', 'color', 'palate', 'Fortunately', 'what', 'production', 'sensitive', 'work', 'ever-dependable', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'who', 'George', 'Falconer', '52-year-old', 'college', 'professor', 'struggling', 'cope', 'death', 'longtime', 'partner', 'actor', 'skillfully', 'pained', 'nuance', 'protective', 'character', 'caught', 'emotional', 'straitjacket', 'due', 'repressed', 'year', 'was', '1962', 'when', 'story', 'place.Based', '1964', 'novel', 'Christopher', 'Isherwood', 'Goodbye', 'Berlin', 'somber', 'tale', 'what', 'George', 'planning', 'be', 'last', 'day', 'alive', 'Jim', 'partner', 'sixteen', 'years', 'died', 'several', 'months', 'earlier', 'car', 'accident', 'George', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'move', 'life', 'Resigned', 'fate', 'day', 'going', 'details', 'getting', 'everything', 'order', 'ensure', 'one', 'pick', 'up', 'George', 'out', 'office', 'safety', 'deposit', 'box', 'clothes', 'neatly', 'send', 'farewell', 'letters', 'circle', 'friends', 'closer', 'what', 'be', 'final', 'moments', 'more', 'immersed', 'memories', 'past', 'Jim', 'However', 'two', 'flesh-and-blood', 'people', 'figure', 'prominently', 'day', 'best', 'friend', 'Charley', 'aging', 'alcoholic', 'socialite', 'whom', 'made', 'long-ago', 'attempt', 'fling', 'smitten', 'student', 'named', 'Kenny', 'who', 'be', 'grappling', 'sexual', 'identity', 'obvious', 'inarticulate', 'attraction', 'George.Firth', 'film', 'together', 'genuinely', 'thoughtful', 'performance', 'can', 'sense', 'tortuous', 'anxiety', 'resigned', 'complacency', 'scene', 'none', 'character', 'viewer', 'Take', 'note', 'way', 'Firth', 'economically', 'heartbreaking', 'scene', 'when', 'George', 'out', 'phone', 'Jim', 'died', 'Obviously', 'crestfallen', 'George', 'composure', 'told', 'not', 'invited', 'funeral', 'Stuck', 'mid-century', 'time', 'warp', 'own', 'doing', 'Far', 'From', 'Heaven', 'Savage', 'Grace', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'still', 'impress', 'relatively', 'brief', 'scenes', 'Charley', 'bantering', 'George', 'gulps', 'gin', 'recognizable', 'balance', 'knowing', 'indifference', 'unrequited', 'romanticism', 'Hoult', 'Boy', 'projects', 'Kenny', 'eagerness', 'bit', 'too', 'easily', 'convey', 'right', 'level', 'vulnerability', 'otherwise', 'Matthew', 'Goode', 'Watchmen', 'Jim', 'idealized', 'flashbacks', 'Spanish', 'model', 'Jon', 'Kortajarena', 'smolders', 'appropriately', 'down-on-his-luck', 'hustler', 'George', 'meets', 'liquor', 'store', 'parking', 'lot', 'Ginnifer', 'Goodwin', 'Big', 'Love', 'Lee', 'Pace', 'Pushing', 'Daisies', 'show', 'up', 'brief', 'cameos', 'Spanish', 'cinematographer', 'Eduard', 'Grau', 'capture', 'varying', 'Almod', 'oacute', 'var-level', 'moods', 'Ford', 'obviously', 'convey', 'even', 'neophyte', 'filmmaker', 'sometimes', 'overboard', 'approach']",N/A

No matter if it is a Colin Firth film and you love him as I do.A SINGLE MAN is such a film. Centered almost wholly on a one-man tour-de-force by Colin as George Falconer, professor of English Literature at UCLA during the Cuban missile crisis (1962), this film has to be one of the best I've seen in many a year. I can't recall when a film captivated me this much.Professor Falconer, still reeling from the sudden death of his lover James Ackerman (Matthew Goode, WATCHMEN) is of course not looking well. He's also balancing life with his close pal and former lover, Charlotte (Julianne Moore doing a flawless London accent). In fact his health is not good and he has had ""something like"" a heart attack already. He starts getting his affairs in order, planning to commit suicide - an 8-month-long life alone is too much for him, after 16 years with James.He's an aristocrat, an uptight, obsessive-compulsive Englishman and it shows: the film has some heartbreaking yet funny moments when George tries different postures and arrangements to shoot himself. At one point he decides he'll stand in the shower, only to lose his footing and slide ignobly onto his butt. Only once before did Kurosawa make me laugh and cry at the same time like this did.A student, Kenny Potter (the beautiful Nicholas Hoult who not only sings beautifully, though not here, but is well known from the British TV comedy ""Skins"") takes a deep interest in George. Though tempted by Charlotte and by a few other young men who catch his eye, George lives in a near-monochromatic life, brightened only by special moments. It is then the screen fires up, beautifully and cheerily colored.Whenever he sees the lovely Kenny (this is set at college and the kid's last name is Potter, could that mean anything?), the color becomes even more intense - it is a brilliant cinematic tool that rises above gimmick and thus rises, not above our notice, but rises to catch and meet our notice. Beautifully done.The flashbacks of life with James and the end results of his fatal car crash are also exquisitely done. The color throbs as though it were a score in itself, heightening and intensifying the emotions. I've never seen anyone do this as well.We know George does not want to die, but he does not want to live as he has been the last 8 months. Since this film is one day - presumably the last day - in George Falconer's life, the emotions drive hard. The night George and Kenny finally hook up, nothing happens but George is content. He will not leave this life just yet, and he may even be thinking of a future with Kenny.As Kenny sleeps on the couch, safely gripping the gun George was going to use ... well, the ending is not what you may imagine in a million years, but it is in a way both tragic and lovely. See for yourself. This beautiful film leads you into thinking you know what will occur next...and you will be wrong every time. One thing you will guess is that young Kenny will be very good 'medicine' for the professor.I never saw a film bring the 1960s back to life like this film ... a time I recall vividly but with no hippies, no riots and lots of books and music. The real treat in this film is the unlikely duo of Firth and Hoult. They seem to take their time getting to know one another ... because the truth is they have already found each other.This film is based on the novel by a writer I admire deeply, Christopher Isherwood, whom everyone should read at least a little bit. (It was directed by Tom Ford, his first time out and not bad at all for a man who really came out of ... well, nowhere. His biggest credit up til now was dressing Daniel Craig in THE QUANTUM OF SOLACE.)Whatever whispers there were of Oscars for Moore and Firth are meaningless: Oscars rarely go out for work of this level. In any event I can't say whether they got Oscars or not but I doubt it. The film, sadly, has a few soggy moments and too much 'slo-mo' for me (and for the MPAAS). I'd have preferred it keep its languid pace throughout, because it does that extremely well, without the cockamamie slowed-up Euro-goof moments.Ignore my literary petulance; it's only a pet peeve of mine. I do have to protest the R-rating this film undeservedly received. For what, a couple of seconds of men's buns? Otherwise totally innocent and not even a single curse word that I could catch anyone uttering? - behold Wallywood and its eternal homophobia.Though it's minor, another reviewer reminded me of two gripes - only two. The first is the scene showing George receiving the news of his lover's death. He asks after a second dog. Trouble is, they never owned a second dog.My other peeve is George's royal pinky ring. We know he left Britain in 1938, presumably so he could be more free in America, but no one below the rank of earl (OK, I'm being more than a little facetious) would wear a ring like his. Prince Charles, as I have noted in other writings, wears the pinky ring of his father. So ... why the hell does Prof. George Falconer wear one, which he clearly never removes in true royal fashion? Ford knows what he's doing here; why not let us in on it?One final kudo to the terrific soundtrack by Abel Korzeniowski (30 DAYS OF NIGHT, BATTLE FOR TERRA): as a 1st-time-out composer, his work is not yapping with pity, but there is a Hitchcock-like nostalgia, a gentle weeping, that makes it some of the finest music I've ever heard. It is the story and the haunting music that will stay with you a long time after you've seen this magnificent film.A great film of firsts: first time director, first time composer of music, first time co-star for Colin Firth. Yet it has that feel of solid, classic film and money cannot buy it. Luckily you can buy the dvd!",4,We see into the life of things,1279756800,"07 22, 2010",2010,5872,"['Now', 'again', 'film', 'along', 'rivets', 'quiet', 'humor', 'whatever', 'film', 'offer', ""'re"",

1291512,A1R560QOL4FJQB,B002VECLVO,Energeticus,"[3, 6]","Colin Firth is a wonderful actor, and I thoroughly enjoyed his performance in this film about sadness and the search for, well, not so much meaning as for an escape from oneself.  The main problem was the screenplay.  We see the protagonist, George Falconer, in his relationship with his lover, Jim, as an essentially pessimistic and lugubrious man unable to share in the latter's joie de vivre.  This undercuts his supposed search for meaning because he is clearly predisposed not to find it.  He is not unable to find caring people, but rather he pushes everyone (gently) away because they are apparently not ""soul mate"" material.  Though he is living in a homophobic era, the early 60s, he is also living in Santa Monica in a beautiful secluded house next to the beach, in an area where it is apparently not really that hard to lead a gay life...although he must be somewhat ""invisible.""  With all this, he still can't cope.  He complains of his dull students in the small college where he teaches...but his inertia/langor keeps him from taking a job at Stanford. This is why his toying with the gun in his bed actually comes off as funny rather than tragic...and Firth actually plays it that way.  Since the guy seems so determined to stay unhappy, at some level, one's natural reaction is to think that maybe he should just go ahead and do it.I must also say that I am very sensitive to cinematography.  There is much that is quite good in this film.  In fact, some of it even borders on being great, especially the use of light and color.  This is why it is so disappointing when, perhaps 15% of the time, the neophyte director descends into the cliche of wobbling the camera when things are supposed to become excited or happen suddenly, etc.  How can I watch the wonderful things the camera does one minute and then ignore the meaningless jiggling right afterwards?  I just find it distracting.  It is a sign that the director is trying to follow a formula rather than really thinking things through visually.  When I see this sort of thing, I start thinking more about the cameraman than about what's going on.",3,A good but not great film (spoilers),1281744000,"08 14, 2010",2010,2119,"['Colin', 'Firth', 'wonderful', 'actor', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'performance', 'film', 'sadness', 'search', 'well', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'meaning', 'escape', 'oneself', 'main', 'problem', 'was', 'screenplay', 'see', 'protagonist', 'George', 'Falconer', 'relationship', 'lover', 'Jim', 'essentially', 'pessimistic', 'lugubrious', 'man', 'unable', 'share', 'latter', 'joie', 'de', 'vivre', 'supposed', 'search', 'meaning', 'clearly', 'predisposed', 'not', 'find', 'not', 'unable', 'find', 'caring', 'people', 'rather', 'everyone', 'gently', 'away', 'are', 'apparently', 'not', 'soul', 'mate', 'material', 'living', 'homophobic', 'era', 'early', '60s', 'also', 'living', 'Santa', 'Monica', 'beautiful', 'secluded', 'house', 'beach', 'area', 'where', 'apparently', 'not', 'really', 'that', 'lead', 'gay', 'life', 'must', 'be', 'somewhat', 'invisible', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'cope', 'dull', 'students', 'small', 'college', 'where', 'inertia/langor', 'keeps', 'taking', 'job', 'Stanford', 'why', 'toying', 'gun', 'bed', 'actually', 'off', 'funny', 'rather', 'tragic', 'Firth', 'actually', 'way', 'guy', 'so', 'determined', 'stay', 'unhappy', 'level', 'one', 'natural', 'reaction', 'think', 'maybe', 'should', 'just', 'go', 'ahead', 'do', 'it.I', 'must', 'also', 'say', 'am', 'very', 'sensitive', 'cinematography', 'much', 'quite', 'good', 'film', 'fact', 'even', 'borders', 'being', 'great', 'especially', 'use', 'light', 'color', 'why', 'so', 'disappointing', 'when', 'perhaps', '15', '%', 'time', 'neophyte', 'director', 'cliche', 'wobbling', 'camera', 'when', 'things', 'are', 'supposed', 'become', 'excited', 'happen', 'suddenly', 'etc', 'How', 'can', 'watch', 'wonderful', 'things', 'camera', 'one', 'minute', 'then', 'ignore', 'meaningless', 'jiggling', 'right', 'afterwards', 'just', 'find', 'distracting', 'sign', 'director', 'trying', 'follow', 'formula', 'rather', 'really', 'thinking', 'things', 'visually', 'When', 'see', 'sort', 'thing', 'start', 'thinking', 'more', 'cameraman', 'what', 'going']",N/A

From the very beginning the viewer is invited into a world of grief which the main hero cannot share with almost anyone else.George Falconer (absolutely brilliant Colin Firth) learns of his long-term partner's (Matthew Goode good-looking as always) death almost by chance, a distant relative is kind enough to make a phone call, but George is immediately barred from participating in the funeral service. This is ""for family only"" and a gay partner does not qualify as such. He does not have the right to mourn the beloved person. The only person with whom he can try to share his grief is his British friend Charlie (stunning Julianne Moore) who is sympathetic but as it turns out does not take Falconer quite as seriously as he would hope for. For her the two men's shared life was ""a substitute for something else"", an idea which Falconer rejects outright.The movie present only one day of Falconer's life, the day which he planned as his last, unable to cope with grief he can't share, mourning he was denied, he contemplates suicide. But life has much more up its sleeve and the day proves much different from anything Falconer could have planned.The movie may seem to deal with the past. It is set in 1962 and no effort was spared in the re-making of the US of the days of JFK admistration. But this is not a period piece, the issue it deals with is more than present for many people who live their lifes stuck in closets usually not of their own making. People who are not allowed to reveal their emotions (not necessarily the negative ones) because that would mean revealing much more, something that others refuse to accept.Tom Ford has a perfect eye for the visual side of the movie-making business, Abel Korzeniowski's score is just as perfect, the casting great.

If anything, I was far more moved by the film than I thought I would be shedding copious tears throughout practically the entire movie.  My reaction, I know, was because it is so wonderfully acted by especially Colin Firth and fabulously directed by Tom Ford!Colin Firth has been a long time favorite actor of mine.  I became a serious fan of his after seeing him in ""Another Country"" many years ago.  However, I do feel this film shows him at his very best.  I was simply overwhelmed. His portrayal of a man that has just lost the love of his life and intends to do away with himself is fantastic.  This movie shows Colin as George on this ""last day"" of his life and how he deals with that one last day of his life.  What fine nuances Colin brings to his acting.  It's a performance that will ""stick"" to me for a long, long time.  After viewing this movie, I've had dreams about it and think about it a lot during the day especially about Colin as George and his acting.  There are moments in the movie that just a look from Colin Firth reduced me to tears--he is that good.I'm not overlooking the other actors in the movie.  All of the actors in this are great.  I especially adored Julianne Moore as George's long time frustrated ""girlfriend"".  Colin and her little dance sequence is marvelous.Tom Ford in his directional debut of a film makes this movie really ""work"" for me!  He certainly has a fine eye for detail.

1291517,A15XNT79BMHKXN,B002VECLVO,"googleit ""movie buff""","[8, 15]","I really wanted to like this movie.  I am a fan of Colin Firth, and read all the great reviews on Amazon.  However, this film just left me cold.A Single Man is undeniably lovely to look at, with every shot composed like a still art photo.  There is a lot of symbolism about the main character, a college English Professor, being ""invisible"" - he lives in a glass-walled house, yet no one seems to notice him very much.  Perhaps a commentary not only on his empty life but also on being a gay man in the 1960s.However, for some reason this film just never made an emotional connection for me.  I found the scene where the Professor gets some devastating news over the phone to be very affecting (and Colin Firth plays this scene beautifully), but that was probably the only truly emotional scene in the movie.  The rest felt very cold and distant.The supporting characters did not seem to add very much.  Julianne Moore's character was a self-pitying former beauty who was now divorced and lonely.  I also found the character of the young student/possible love interest to be very off-putting.  I'm not sure if it was the actor who played him, or just the way the part was written.  I think he was supposed to be earnest and wide-eyed, but he came off very stilted and a little creepy and stalker-ish.  For a moment I actually thought there may be some twist where the student turned out to be a con artist or something.  The whole relationship, and their conversations, seemed very forced and strange.I also felt that the movie was a little pretentious in its style.  For example, a flashback to the Professor and his old lover was filmed in bright black and white while they were laying on the rocks in some desert landscape.  It came off like a Calvin Kline ad.  It seemed calculated to be ""artsy"" and all it did was take the viewer out of the movie.All in all, disappointing and slow in this movie fan's opinion.",2,"Plodding, slow, and a little pretentious",1280188800,"07 27, 2010",2010,1915,"['really', 'wanted', 'like', 'movie', 'am', 'fan', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'read', 'great', 'reviews', 'Amazon', 'However', 'film', 'just', 'left', 'cold.A', 'Single', 'Man', 'undeniably', 'lovely', 'look', 'shot', 'composed', 'still', 'art', 'photo', 'lot', 'symbolism', 'main', 'character', 'college', 'English', 'Professor', 'being', 'invisible', 'glass-walled', 'house', 'one', 'notice', 'very', 'much', 'Perhaps', 'commentary', 'not', 'only', 'empty', 'life', 'also', 'being', 'gay', 'man', '1960s.However', 'reason', 'film', 'just', 'never', 'made', 'emotional', 'connection', 'found', 'scene', 'where', 'Professor', 'devastating', 'news', 'phone', 'be', 'very', 'affecting', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'scene', 'beautifully', 'was', 'probably', 'only', 'truly', 'emotional', 'scene', 'movie', 'rest', 'felt', 'very', 'cold', 'distant.The', 'supporting', 'characters', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'add', 'very', 'much', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'character', 'was', 'self-pitying', 'former', 'beauty', 'who', 'was', 'now', 'divorced', 'lonely', 'also', 'found', 'character', 'young', 'student/possible', 'love', 'interest', 'be', 'very', 'off-putting', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'just', 'way', 'part', 'was', 'written', 'think', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'earnest', 'wide-eyed', 'came', 'off', 'very', 'stilted', 'little', 'creepy', 'stalker-ish', 'moment', 'actually', 'thought', 'may', 'be', 'twist', 'where', 'student', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'con', 'artist', 'something', 'whole', 'relationship', 'conversations', 'seemed', 'very', 'forced', 'strange.I', 'also', 'felt', 'movie', 'was', 'little', 'pretentious', 'style', 'example', 'flashback', 'Professor', 'old', 'lover', 'was', 'filmed', 'bright', 'black', 'white', 'were', 'laying', 'rocks', 'desert', 'landscape', 'came', 'off', 'Calvin', 'Kline', 'ad', 'seemed', 'calculated', 'be', 'artsy', 'did', 'was', 'take', 'viewer', 'movie.All', 'disappointing', 'slow', 'movie', 'fan', 'opinion']",N/A
1291518,A328S9RN3U5M68,B002VECLVO,Grady Harp,"[76, 81]","Now and then a film comes along that is so perfect as examined from every angle that restores faith in the art of motion pictures.  Such is the case with A SINGLE MAN.  Starting with the beautiful novel of a gay British professor's planned last day of life in Southern California by Christopher Isherwood, adapted for the screen by Tom Ford with dignity and the power to open up the subtleties of Isherwood's book without treading on the solemnity of the books message, directed by that same newcomer Tom Ford with conviction and identification with Isherwood's characters, and then acted with consummate skill by Colin Firth as single man George who is surrounded with an excellent supporting cast - this film is in a class by itself and hopefully those who decide on the awards for best film/best acting will honor it.George (Colin Firth) begins what appears to be a rather ordinary day for a teacher of English in a close by college, the voice over by Firth relates the routine of rising and facing another day of loneliness he has been experiencing since the accidental death of his young lover Jim (Matthew Goode), yet  there is something unique about this day: George is preparing for his last day on earth as he sets out his funeral attire and his gun and other accoutrements that suggest he is seriously going to end his life.  He busies himself with getting to class, leaving money for his housekeeper Alva (Paulette Lamori),  facing students who seem to be uninvolved with life in general and his course on Aldous Huxley in particular, then clearing his office and progressing with his exit plan.  Little things happen: he observes his neighbors, the Strunks (wife/mother Ginnifer Goodwin, grumpy husband/father Teddy Sears, the annoying yet perceptive little girl Ryan Simpkins and brothers Paul Butler and Aaron Sanders) as they 'play at ordinary normal life'; he talks with his longtime friend Charley (Julianne Moore), an ex 'lover' who shares his life secrets and invites him to yet another evening of food and drink and thwarted seduction; he is followed by one of his students Kenny (Nicholas Hoult) who despite the age difference offers a sense of caring and need for closeness; and he encounters a young handsome Spaniard Carlos (Jon Kortajarena) whom he befriends but decides not to pick up as a physical diversion.  Little incidents remind him of his longterm relationship with his beloved Jim and these reminders are magically captured in flashbacks in tonal colors that create a sense of aging scrapbook pages.  How George's planned 'suicide day' ends gathers all of the beauty of this film in some moments as finely tuned as we are likely to ever see on celluloid.Colin Firth IS George and the subtleties of his characterization are almost unbearably beautiful to watch.  His home feels like Isherwood's home in Santa Monica: there are even drawings by Don Bachardy, Isherwood's lover, sensitively placed in the set. Julianne Moore gives another brilliant performance as the distraught alcoholic aging friend of George, and Nicholas Hoult and Matthew Goode give us characters to admire and to love.  For this viewer this is as perfect a film as is possible to make.  Highly recommended on every level.

When fate intercedes and thatrelationship is forever changed, further compounded by thecallous disregard of his feelings and their relationship'svalidity by his partner's stodgy family, Firth playsthat notification scene with such emotion and power thatone can't help but be moved by it!He is a broken man after that who just goes through lifeon auto-pilot mostly and decides that he has had enoughof this exsistence and wants to reunite with his love.His ray of light amid all the darkness is played byJulianne Moore, who also delivers a great performanceas his close freind who has her own issues but is alwaysthere for her dear friend who satisfies her desire to beneeded as she has been abandoned by her husband and herson is now grown and off in the world on his own.These two share a colorful history and understand thelight and dark of each other perfectly well.He knows where all her bodies are buried, and sheknows where all his are! (-: Their dinner scene bringsthe levity to this film. There are also alot of flashbacksin this film which help to bring the story together better.The actor who plays the young college student who isdetermined to be a part of Firth's character's lifebecause he is drawn to him, the twinky Nicholas Hoult,does an excellent job at bringing some light into Firth's character's life too.Although I was a bit skeptical and apprehensiveabout his motives at first!Then fate intercedes again at the end and throwsa curveball that I didn't see coming....Though upon a second viewing, there were subtlehints of what was to come!

Corbin ""Foster Corbin""","[20, 23]","I was not sure-- in spite of all the pre-release positive publicity-- that fashion designer Tom Ford in his directing debut would make a decent movie adaptation of one of my favorite novels. I was wrong. ""A Single Man"" from Christopher Isherwood's novel by the same name for the most part succeeds on every level. Colin Firth as George Falconer,  a transplanted Britisher and teacher of English in a lackluster college, gives a really fine performance and is totally believable as someone riddled with grief over the death of his lover Jim (Matthew Goode) several months ago in an automobile accident. Julianne Moore who plays George's friend Charlotte deserves an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress. She is slouching towards middle-age and trying to hold her life together. If only she and George could have had a lasting relationship as lovers rather than friends. (Even though the events take place in one day in Los Angeles in 1962, unfortunately some straight women still think this way.) Finally Nicholas Hoult more than holds his own with Firth and Moore as Kenny, the student who is onto his closeted professor-- it is 1962 after all-- and prettier than a lad has a right to be. It is easy to see why George would be sexually attracted to him.Much of the action takes place in close settings so I understand the use of extreme closeups. The film would have been just as successful, however, if some of the closeups had been edited out. I'm not sure we need to see the pores of George's skin, for example, though that is a minor criticism of the film.The costumes and furnishings are vintage 60's and perfect even to those ugly lamps in George's home-- something we would expect from the likes of Mr. Ford. Two of my favorite scenes are George and Charlotte's dinner and drinking evening that gets dangerously close to a George and Martha event (""Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf"") and George and Kenny's sexually charged skinnydipping frolic that is both beautifully and tastefully filmed.In the end the film remains faithful to Isherwood's novel and captures the essence of the loneliness of life after the death of someone you loved dearly. Mr. Isherwood wrote the novel during a particularly rocky time in his relationship with his lover Don Bachardy and said that he wanted to capture what his life would be like without his lover.Lovers of the film should read the novel if they haven't already.

1291521,A3ML2HRDE3PY5I,B002VECLVO,Hikari,"[2, 4]","3.5 stars. Throughout his career, Colin Firth has had to live down the persona of ""Mr.Darcy"" in ""Pride & Prejudice"", the role that made him a star and which it seems he was born to play. Now Mr. Firth gives life to a role on the opposite end of the spectrum from Mr. Darcy, and it's a testament to his acting talent that he seems equally born to have played it as well. His George Falconer, a 50-something English professor coping (poorly) with the death of his longtime partner in 1962 closeted Los Angeles wakes up one morning 8 months into his grief and decides that today is going to be different: Today he is going to end his life. As George goes about his last day, tidying up his earthly affairs, he encounters various people that show him that it might be possible, and worthwhile, to imagine a life beyond his grief. Firth is an actor of sublime subtlety who can capture myriad complex emotions in the space of one close-up. He is in every scene. First-time director Tom Ford has assembled a cast of wonderful British actors around Firth who are all playing American; unaccountably the only American in the cast with a major role, Julianne Moore, is playing British (badly). Her affected in-and-out attempt at 'posh' plus the completely immaterial device of setting George's last day during the Cuban missile crisis forces me to dock this half a star. The period is stunningly recreated, but this story might have been equally powerful, if not more so, by being contemporary.

The movie IS very interesting visually which is probably why Tom Ford wanted to make it - to be able to play with the palette and elements of early 1960s design. The glass-and-wood house where the Firth character lived with his boyfriend, the easy decor of Julianne Moore's house and garden, the well-cut suits, the funeral outfit Firth lays out for someone to find (note left on the tie: &#34;I'm in a Windsor knot&#34;), the self-styled James Dean clone from Madrid - all very pretty and interesting to look at, if you can stay awake through the non-plot.

1291523,AW1493ZQTQ2ET,B002VECLVO,Irfan A. Alvi,"[3, 3]","Going into this movie, I had no idea what it was about (which is the way I like it), so I confess that I was somewhat thrown when I found that the lead character is gay, since this is alien territory for me.  But I decided to keep an open mind and persist, and I'm glad I did.  It turns out that the movie is ultimately about finding meaning in life - a topic which I've lately been exploring fairly intensively - and the gay aspect is only of peripheral significance (at most).As I interpret it, the basic message of the movie is that we can best find meaning by attentively savoring and appreciating the present moment, perhaps enriched by drawing on our fonder memories from the past, all while recognizing that we and our loved ones may die at any time, with little or no prior warning.  The movie hints at the possibility of an afterlife, but this prospect is never fleshed out and thus remains uncertain.While this is a powerful and important message, it's actually delivered in a rather subtle and nuanced way, in an atmosphere of persistent but quiet tension, so you have to pay attention and meet the movie at least half way.  And also be sure to watch the interviews in the DVD bonus materials, since they add important insights which could even be considered an essential component of the movie.The only significant negative thing I can say about the movie is that, while the goal was presumably to present a generally positive and hopeful message, my overall feeling at the end of the movie was more in the direction of sadness.  Perhaps I'm predisposed in that direction due to having myself lost a loved one not so long ago, but I think this aspect has to be mentioned, in case anyone expects that this will be a straightforward feel-good movie.Nevertheless, I do recommend this movie to anyone seeking a delicately powerful exploration of some of the deeper questions of life.",5,Vividly bittersweet,1283385600,"09 2, 2010",2010,1891,"['Going', 'movie', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'way', 'so', 'confess', 'was', 'somewhat', 'thrown', 'when', 'found', 'lead', 'character', 'gay', 'alien', 'territory', 'decided', 'keep', 'open', 'mind', 'persist', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'out', 'movie', 'ultimately', 'finding', 'meaning', 'life', 'topic', ""'ve"", 'lately', 'been', 'exploring', 'fairly', 'intensively', 'gay', 'aspect', 'only', 'peripheral', 'significance', 'most', '.As', 'interpret', 'basic', 'message', 'movie', 'can', 'best', 'find', 'meaning', 'attentively', 'savoring', 'appreciating', 'present', 'moment', 'perhaps', 'enriched', 'drawing', 'fonder', 'memories', 'past', 'recognizing', 'loved', 'ones', 'may', 'die', 'time', 'little', 'prior', 'warning', 'movie', 'hints', 'possibility', 'afterlife', 'prospect', 'never', 'fleshed', 'out', 'thus', 'uncertain.While', 'powerful', 'important', 'message', 'actually', 'delivered', 'rather', 'subtle', 'nuanced', 'way', 'atmosphere', 'persistent', 'quiet', 'tension', 'have', 'pay', 'attention', 'meet', 'movie', 'least', 'half', 'way', 'also', 'be', 'sure', 'watch', 'interviews', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'materials', 'add', 'important', 'insights', 'could', 'even', 'be', 'considered', 'essential', 'component', 'movie.The', 'only', 'significant', 'negative', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'movie', 'goal', 'was', 'presumably', 'present', 'generally', 'positive', 'hopeful', 'message', 'overall', 'feeling', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'more', 'direction', 'sadness', 'Perhaps', ""'m"", 'predisposed', 'direction', 'due', 'having', 'lost', 'loved', 'one', 'not', 'so', 'long', 'ago', 'think', 'aspect', 'be', 'mentioned', 'case', 'anyone', 'will', 'be', 'straightforward', 'feel-good', 'movie.Nevertheless', 'do', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'seeking', 'delicately', 'powerful', 'exploration', 'deeper', 'questions', 'life']",N/A

Sondel - lover of the arts""","[7, 8]","I read Christopher Isherwood's novel A Single Man at least a dozen years ago, and remember thinking it a real downer.  So, when I heard that Tom Ford was making a film my reaction was - of all the gay literature, why A Single Man?  Well, Tom obviously knows best, for A Single Man is one of the best films of the year - if not the best.I've read a number of derogatory comments about former fashion designer Ford's artsy-fartsy direction, and its all garbage.  Each of the production elements is top drawer: the music, costumes and cinematography are elegant and sophisticated.  The look of the film is fresh and it moves with a sexy, sinewy fluidity.  The screenplay by Ford and  David Scearce is as faithful an adaptation from a literary source as I have ever seen.The cast is headed by a brilliant Colin Firth as George, a literature professor who has only recently lost his companion of 16 years (Matthew Goode).  Firth has been one of those generic British actors who fill out the casts of costume dramas like Shakespeare in Love and The English Patient, or plays the second lead in comedic films like Bridget Jones' Diary or Mama Mia!  His performance here is simply a revelation, communicating volumes with a simple glance or gesture, his face registering each emotion with a subtlety and surety that warrants idolatrous praise and prizes.Unlike Firth, Julianne Moore has been delivering great performances for the better part of two decades.  As George's lonely, boozy, British friend Charley, Moore creates an indelible character, perfectly articulated without a trace of overreaching or camp.  Goode, from last year's Brideshead Revisited, plays George's deceased lover Jim; Jon Kortajarena plays a fetching young hustler; and Nicholas Hoult (from About a Boy) plays Kenny, a student who pursues George, reviving his faith in the possible and the future.In lesser hands this could have turned into a vapid or maudlin `day in the life' or `a grief observed' movie of the week.

A gay university professor - what a d&eacute;j&agrave; vu character - loses his 16 year long love affair with the accidental death of his lover to whose funeral he will explicitly not be invited. He cannot accept this solitude. So he delivers his last classes, cleans up his office and walks out with the intention of not coming back. On the university parking lot he is stopped by a young student who is obviously making a discreet pass to him. He does not encourage it. On the liquor store parking lot he crosses a gigolo who is making a pass to him too but he discourages it in the end. He visits his lifelong girlfriend of old and walks home to carry out his last living act. But he can't. So he goes to the bar next door to buy cigarettes and a bottle of alcohol. There he is captured by the young student and his innocent looking smile. They drink. On a challenge from the student they go swim in the Pacific Ocean. Back at the professor's place they drink some more. The professor passes away. He wakes up on his bed at 3 in the morning with the student sleeping on the sofa holding the gun. The professor takes the gun away burns his suicide notes and dreams of a new lapse of love and life. But when death has come death has to triumph and it always does, even if it were in the form of a breathing vegetable. The details of the death are in the film.

A"" A Single Man"" is a glorious example. Firth plays George Falconer, an British teacher of college English in 1962 Los Angeles. We know the year because televisions and radios endless broadcast stories about the Cuban Missile Crisis. We learn almost immediately that Falconer is gay, and that his lover and friend, Jim, has been killed in a traffic accident. Bereft, Falconer becomes suicidal. Being British, he need to put his affairs in tidy order first. These include friendships with Charley (Julianne Moore), a boozy, spurned woman whose husband dumped her for someone younger and more beautiful. Falconer also meets a number of gay and maybe-gay men, including one of his students, who become touch points and opportunities to reminisce about his now-lost relationship. Some might think this an obvious or cloying visual device, but Falconer's inner moods are shown by the saturation of color on the screen. When he is engaged with another person, the colors are vibrant; when he becomes morose, the colors are muted. A repeating motif of Firth floating nude in a dark sea also becomes a clue to his inner listlessness and despair.""A Single Man"" explores the grief of a man who is not allowed to grieve publicly for the man he loved. The early 1960s were still an extremely buttoned-up era for homosexuals. They rendered their sexuality invisible as a means of self-protection, and were years away from beginning to assert their rights to be seen as persons. Firth's choice as Falconer was nearly perfect; sometimes it seems he can't depict ANY emotions. The plotline took the characters to unexpected and mostly unfulfilled places.

Rooney,"[1, 5]","""A Single Man"" (2009) is a well-intentioned movie I very much wanted to like, but it wouldn't let me completely embrace it because of the pacing of the movie and the ennui of the central character. Don't get me wrong. It's very much better than many other films out there. Colin Firth plays a college professor, George Falconer, age 52, who eight months later is still depressed over the death of his male lover of some sixteen years. He has decided to commit suicide.This is well-acted film with ponderous, irritating pacing. The photography is arty, mannered, and showy. It has some phony flashbacks and occasionally uses slow motion and extreme close-ups of faces (the secretary's, for example) that seem oddly out of place. It's almost as if some novice got a hold of a camera.It's a downer of a movie. The protagonist's depression, at times, becomes boring. It's the early sixties so he is basically closeted. It's the Cuban missile crisis when the media is playing up the fear of nuclear annihilation and people are talking about bomb shelters. The one time when this English professor becomes publicly animated and passionate is when he changes to the topic of the atmosphere of fear of minorities when he's supposed to be lecturing on Aldous Huxley's ""After Many a Summer Dies the Swan.""He goes around in a daze. It's walking a difficult line; trying to portray someone depressed without losing your audience. Watching depression can become depressing. The movie left me somewhat dazed, hoping for something a little better, perhaps more daring. The character is numb, and I'm afraid, at times, the audience is numbed. It's based upon a groundbreaking 1964 novel by openly gay Christopher Isherwood.Still, this is a movie worth seeing. Groundbreaking in its own way.

1291532,A8QG61LYK0XO1,B002VECLVO,JUST A REVIEWER2,"[2, 3]","......performance by a Colin Firth at the very top of his game.  Oh, and forget any ""gay"" connotation; it's really not important.  Why?  Because in an alternate version of this film, Firth would play his role in a same-words, same-emotions kind of way......in EXACTLY the same heart-rending manner we've just witnessed from him on screen.  In such a second version, ""George"" would face loss of his life's love---either female lover or more likely, wife---and struggle toward a way in which to go on.  And an English Department blonde secretary, perhaps, would fill in for a ""Carlos.""  But, like ""George,"" only ""Kenny"" (a neuter character searching for his sexuality and/or a victim of hero worship) would be reenacting his same role in the second version.  (Oh, and I suppose we could let old friend, ""Charley"" / JuIianne Moore, hang around again).  In sum, then, I believe it is paramount you realize that in this other take of the film Firth, particularly, would play his character in an identical manner---no matter the sex of his ""partner.""That's correct, viewers past and future; now you've got it.  This is NOT a gay drama (certainly not a gay romance), but rather a tale of love lost (one of life's biggest) and, more importantly, is a lesson in enduring.

1291533,A1AKQ1YUS4BT82,B002VECLVO,"Katie Babs ""Katiebabs""","[7, 7]","A Single Man is much like an art house film. It was released last year and written and directed by designer, and former Gucci creative director, Tom Ford. This is a very quiet and moving film that shows isolation, loneliness and loss of love. A Single Man takes place in November 1962, and is about an English professor who, after the sudden, shocking death of his partner and lover, goes about his typical day in Los Angeles. Colin Firth, who plays Professor George Falconer, shines in this role, and after seeing him in many movies, I must say this is his best acting to date. And apparently most of the movie industry agreed. For this role, Colin was nominated for his first Oscar in the Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role, as well as The Golden Globes and went on  to win Best Actor for the BAFTAS, London Critics Circle Film among many others. Also, A Single Man was nominated for outstanding film at the GLAAD Media Awards.Tom Ford has excelled as a first time movie director with A Single Man. Not only relying on the masterful acting of Colin Firth, and Julianne Moore, as Charley, a middle-aged, rich drunken divorcee, but Tom sets up a scene, much like Orson Welles would do, where the audience must soak up every single frame to get the full effect of the range of emotions from his actors. Not many directors will allow many close ups and keep the camera still for almost a minute, where we just watch the actor's face. But Tom has done this here. Just by watching the range of emotions on Colin Firth's face as he remembers his dead lover of over twenty years, you feel such a connection to this man, and the harsh realities one must experience when that one person they love beyond all else is no longer in their lives.George is not only depressed, but empty inside. His will to live has vanished. The reason is because one snowy night, eight months ago, his one true love, Jim (played by Matthew Goode), was in a car accident. Jim died along with his and George's two beloved dogs. George found this out from a phone call from a member of Jim's family. George was not invited to the funeral, nor was he called right away when the accident happened. We are led to believe that Jim's family possibly didn't agree with Jim's lifestyle and his relationship with George. After George ends the phone call, he sits there is shock, then in grief and finally breaks down. The amazing range of emotion on George's face, thanks to the acting skill of Colin is superb, and you feel his heartbreak alongside him.George can't get passed Jim's death, and because of that, he decides on a specific course of action one sunny day that will end with a possible shocking outcome when all is said and done. Every action and thought of George's revolves around what he used to have with Jim. We see through flashbacks how he and Jim met, their days together how they would just sit on the couch and read or chat, while Jim smiles in his playful manner, coaxing a loving response from George.But although George feels he has nothing left to live for, on this very special day, he begins to notice that perhaps his life is not all that bad. He has a wonderful, loving friend with Charley, who he has known more than half his life. Even one of his students, Kenny (played by Nicholas Hoult) sees something special in George, and is more than willing to help George heal. It's all up to George to decide what his next step is, and if he's willing not to give up and embrace those around him who can give him as much love and happiness he once had with Jim.The title- A Single Man is perfect in describing who George is. For a very long time, George wasn't single. He was connected to another person, where the two halves of their soul became one entity. George and Jim were each other's soul mates in every sense. Now George must find his identity again. The start of the film shows George barely going through the daily motions, and as the story progresses, he begins to come back to life. This is shown perfectly with color. When George is depressed or reliving his pain, everything is muted and dull. But when he smiles or enjoys something as simple as a conversation, everything around him becomes brighter with color in very much the literal sense.Not many actors can play a character like George. A Single Man is more of a character piece, an analysis, a one man show into a person's emotional psyche. Colin Firth plays George to near perfection. His loyalty and dedication to his dead lover, even when he has the opportunity to enjoy physical relations with other men, is moving. He won't give into his need for release because of his dedication to Jim.A Single Man is very much a romance and shows how love can free a person. We see this between George and Charley, whose long lasting friendship is one we all wish we could have with another person. George's student, Kenny is full of innocence and has a near puppy like crush on George that never crosses an uncomfortable line. And then finally there is Jim, the ghost from George's past that he must let go so he can move on. And when George finally decides to let Jim go, it is very heartbreaking, as well as peaceful.This is one movie that is very visually stunning, with awe inspiring acting. If you have a chance, please do view A Single Man. It's a true piece of art from a new visionary and with actors, such as Colin Firth and Julianne Moore, who are two of the best movie actors of this century.Katiebabs",5,Visually Stunning Movie With

Even now though, the press and critics bafflingly seem to be reining-in the enthusiasm, wondering whether A Single Man has any real substance behind fashion-designer-turned-filmmaker Tom Ford's superficial stylizations or whether there is any real depth behind Colin Firth's performance.  There most certainly is.Set in LA in 1962, an aging English professor, finding it impossible to publicly grieve the death of his homosexual partner who has just died in a car crash, sets about arranging for his own suicide.  There certainly seems to be little more to the film than George's painful reminiscences of what has been lost mixed with chance encounters in the present day - minor encounters mostly, none of them apparently significant enough to deter him from the direction he is determined to take - but each of the little episodes that make up the film and the manner in which they are filmed, cumulatively add up to a realistic and meaningful consideration of the experience of loving, living and dying.Tom Ford's direction and visual language - the period detail, the coloration, the emphasis on mood and facial expression over expositional dialogue - would seem to owe much to Wong Kar-wai - an impression enforced by the use of Shigeru Umebayashi on the soundtrack - but the director nonetheless finds in it a personal means to best express the complexity of emotions that the situation gives rise to.  Colin Firth is a revelation in this respect, his usual impassive demeanour appropriate for the reserved nature of his character, but there's a brave openness about his performance that we've not seen before that allows George's vulnerability to break through.  This may very well be the film of the year - it's certainly one of the most beautiful.",5,"A sensitive meditation on loving, living and dying",1266278400,"02 16, 2010",2010,1994,"['run-up', '2010', 'Oscars', 'dominated', 'well-made', 'overhyped', 'mainstream', 'Hollywood', 'hopefuls', 'Up', 'Air', 'Avatar', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'Hollywood', 'wannabes', 'A', 'Prophet', 'one', 'film', 'up', 'hype', 'then', 'Even', 'now', 'press', 'critics', 'bafflingly', 'seem', 'be', 'reining-in', 'enthusiasm', 'wondering', 'A', 'Single', 'Man', 'real', 'substance', 'fashion-designer-turned-filmmaker', 'Tom', 'Ford', 'superficial', 'stylizations', 'real', 'depth', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'performance', 'most', 'certainly', 'is.Set', 'LA', '1962', 'aging', 'English', 'professor', 'finding', 'impossible', 'publicly', 'grieve', 'death', 'homosexual', 'partner', 'who', 'just', 'died', 'car', 'crash', 'sets', 'arranging', 'own', 'suicide', 'certainly', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'film', 'George', 'painful', 'reminiscences', 'been', 'lost', 'mixed', 'chance', 'encounters', 'present', 'day', 'minor', 'encounters', 'mostly', 'none', 'apparently', 'significant', 'enough', 'deter', 'direction', 'determined', 'take', 'little', 'episodes', 'make', 'up', 'film', 'manner', 'are', 'filmed', 'cumulatively', 'add', 'up', 'realistic', 'meaningful', 'consideration', 'experience', 'loving', 'living', 'dying.Tom', 'Ford', 'direction', 'visual', 'language', 'period', 'detail', 'coloration', 'emphasis', 'mood', 'facial', 'expression', 'expositional', 'dialogue', 'would', 'seem', 'owe', 'much', 'Wong', 'Kar-wai', 'impression', 'enforced', 'use', 'Shigeru', 'Umebayashi', 'soundtrack', 'director', 'nonetheless', 'personal', 'means', 'best', 'express', 'complexity', 'emotions', 'situation', 'rise', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'revelation', 'respect', 'usual', 'impassive', 'demeanour', 'appropriate', 'reserved', 'nature', 'character', 'brave', 'openness', 'performance', ""'ve"", 'not', 'seen', 'George', 'vulnerability', 'break', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'film', 'year', 'certainly', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful']",N/A

His lover has died and George has calmly decided that he cannot bear to live another day alone.  He teaches a class, puts his papers in order, sees his best friend, and is ready to go.  Then, one of his students interrupts his plan.This very intimate, somber, arty film has a good script and good actors.  Firth gives a wonderful performance as a man who welcomes death; his expressive eyes speak volumes about George's pain.  Julianne Moore looks like Ann-Margret with a questionable British accent and is really annoying in a small role.  Nicholas Hoult is excellent as the student who makes George think there may be a reason to live after all.The director uses constant flashbacks and stylized photography and changing colors to make his emotional points and I think it all comes across as a bit heavy-handed, as does the Bernard Herrmann-esque soundtrack.

George, who has never recovered from the death of his long time lover, Jim, several months before, has since become increasingly and unbearably isolated from the world around him.  The inability to share his grief with others has made George's loss even more unbearable and his loneliness even more painful.Amid amazingly beautiful visual artistry, we see George subtly experiencing the world around him as he moves through his presumptive last day.  After George delivers what he believes to be his final lecture with an uncharacteristic lack of restraint, an inspired young student confides to George his own sense of fear and isolation. George seeks out Charlotte, his long time confidant and friend who was a lover briefly and still clings to the hope she and George might have a future together.  However, Charlotte's insensitive minimizing of George's relationship with Jim and her persistence in lamenting their lack of a long term sexual relationship, makes George realize even Charlotte doesn't understand who he really is.Tom Ford simply takes the audience into another world by using stunningly beautiful imagery to create Georges world and convey his loneliness and detachment.

1291541,A3OL1AX1IODBYL,B002VECLVO,"Laurel-Rain Snow &#34;Rain&#34; ""Rainy Days""","[1, 3]","When George (Colin Firth) loses his lover Jim (Matthew Goode) after sixteen years together, the color has disappeared from his life.  He goes through the routines, thinking often of the past; his primary connections are his students at the small university where he teaches and an old friend Charley (Julianne Moore).His next-door neighbors have two small children, and the occasional noise and other activities sometimes feel like an intrusion into the quiet life he now lives.Then one day a student seems to connect to George and a dialogue begins.Meanwhile, however, George seems to be going through a process--getting his papers in order; picking out a suitable outfit; and buying bullets for his gun.  As he moves slowly forward toward some kind of conclusion, we see fewer flashbacks into memories.What happens ultimately, however, is a surprising ""intrusion"" that is unexpected and perhaps fortuitous.  But then, just when we believe we know what will happen, another unexpected event turns everything around again.ThroughoutA Single Man, I noticed the visual effects that set the past and present apart.  The film makers displayed the past moments in vivid colors, while the present lacked the depth of tone.  The present seemed almost cloaked in sepia tones, but not quite.The setting for this movie was 1962 LA, with the Cuban missile crisis casting its own pall over the characters' lives.  There were many things that showed us this time period--rotary telephones; older cars; clothing; hairstyles; and, of course, the sense that the characters were grabbing life's pleasures when impending doom seemed to lurk.  Another telling aspect of the times was the ""secrecy"" surrounding George's homosexuality, a definite pointer to a less accepting period in our history.After I watched the movie, I felt depressed and cloaked in the futility of life and any kind of a future. It reminded me of how I felt during that year, when as college students, we listened to our professors as they vividly described the political climate in which we lived.I gave the film four stars, primarily because I didn't really like it.  I got the message and I thought the different shades of color were a clever way to distinguish past and present.  But aside from that subtle distinction, there was little about the movie that would linger on in my mind or add anything to my repertoire of memories.",4,LOSING SIGNIFICANT CONNECTIONS...,1278374400,"07 6, 2010",2010,2387,"['When', 'George', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'lover', 'Jim', 'Matthew', 'Goode', 'sixteen', 'years', 'together', 'color', 'disappeared', 'life', 'routines', 'thinking', 'often', 'past', 'primary', 'connections', 'are', 'students', 'small', 'university', 'where', 'old', 'friend', 'Charley', 'Julianne', 'Moore', '.His', 'next-door', 'neighbors', 'have', 'two', 'small', 'children', 'occasional', 'noise', 'other', 'activities', 'sometimes', 'feel', 'intrusion', 'quiet', 'life', 'now', 'one', 'day', 'student', 'connect', 'George', 'dialogue', 'begins.Meanwhile', 'however', 'George', 'be', 'going', 'process', 'getting', 'papers', 'order', 'picking', 'out', 'suitable', 'outfit', 'buying', 'bullets', 'gun', 'slowly', 'forward', 'kind', 'conclusion', 'see', 'fewer', 'flashbacks', 'ultimately', 'however', 'surprising', 'intrusion', 'unexpected', 'perhaps', 'fortuitous', 'then', 'just', 'when', 'believe', 'know', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'unexpected', 'event', 'everything', 'again.ThroughoutA', 'Single', 'Man', 'noticed', 'visual', 'effects', 'set', 'past', 'present', 'apart', 'film', 'makers', 'displayed', 'past', 'moments', 'vivid', 'colors', 'present', 'lacked', 'depth', 'tone', 'present', 'seemed', 'almost', 'cloaked', 'sepia', 'tones', 'not', 'quite.The', 'setting', 'movie', 'was', '1962', 'LA', 'Cuban', 'missile', 'crisis', 'casting', 'own', 'pall', 'characters', 'lives', 'were', 'many', 'things', 'showed', 'time', 'period', 'rotary', 'telephones', 'older', 'cars', 'clothing', 'hairstyles', 'course', 'sense', 'characters', 'were', 'grabbing', 'life', 'pleasures', 'when', 'impending', 'doom', 'seemed', 'lurk', 'telling', 'aspect', 'times', 'was', 'secrecy', 'surrounding', 'George', 'homosexuality', 'definite', 'pointer', 'less', 'accepting', 'period', 'history.After', 'watched', 'movie', 'felt', 'depressed', 'cloaked', 'futility', 'life', 'kind', 'future', 'reminded', 'how', 'felt', 'year', 'when', 'college', 'students', 'listened', 'professors', 'vividly', 'described', 'political', 'climate', 'lived.I', 'gave', 'film', 'four', 'stars', 'primarily', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'got', 'message', 'thought', 'different', 'shades', 'color', 'were', 'clever', 'way', 'distinguish', 'past', 'present', 'aside', 'subtle', 'distinction', 'was', 'little', 'movie', 'would', 'linger', 'mind', 'add', 'anything', 'repertoire', 'memories']",N/A

1291544,AAX9ZIMIYJ77W,B002VECLVO,Lei,"[8, 25]","Derived from Christopher Isherwood's book, A Single Man (2009), was taken to film by Tom Ford. I am not sure if he read the book, fell in love with it, and decided to spend all his money on a crap movie. Honestly Mr. Ford, please stick with fashion design. The wardrobe, makeup, and hair of course made the actors look incredible, but it feel like the entire film lacks substance. It's like the whole course of the film was a day dream with no real plot, poor dialogue, and no climax. I thought the film was going to get better after the opening. The opening scene was fine, but then the film got progressively slower, and slower. It was depressing. George is a professor who recounts the loss of his lover. During the time he meets a few other men who can't replace, or take George's mind off of his deceased lover. If the goal was to make me depressed, then mission accomplished. The back of the cover says, ""The story is a romantic tale of love interrupted...and, ultimately, the importance of the seemingly smaller moments in life"". Smaller moments? You got that right. So much time was spent on presenting pointless scenes: the character staring at something, or someone, or poor dialogue. I felt like I never understood the characters or got to know them. Besides Colin Firth and Julianne Moore, I cannot recall the purpose of the other actors. They were pointless. Colin Firth is extremely boring in this film. His best acting was in the lecture hall, but even that scene didn't do it for me. Julianne Moore played a similar role in Savage Grace, but that film having to do with homosexuality was a lot more interesting than this one. The only interesting part for me of the entire film is the scene where George (Colin Firth) started talking about fear in his lecture, but his analogies were off to me. There are other movies that can capture the hardships of love loss and complexities of homosexual relationships a lot more intriguing than this.",1,"Slow and Depressing, but I Guess that's the Point",1283644800,"09 5, 2010",2010,1955,"['Derived', 'Christopher', 'Isherwood', 'book', 'A', 'Single', 'Man', '2009', 'was', 'taken', 'film', 'Tom', 'Ford', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'read', 'book', 'fell', 'love', 'decided', 'spend', 'money', 'crap', 'movie', 'Honestly', 'Mr.', 'Ford', 'please', 'stick', 'fashion', 'design', 'wardrobe', 'makeup', 'hair', 'course', 'made', 'actors', 'look', 'incredible', 'feel', 'entire', 'film', 'lacks', 'substance', 'whole', 'course', 'film', 'was', 'day', 'dream', 'real', 'plot', 'poor', 'dialogue', 'climax', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'going', 'get', 'better', 'opening', 'opening', 'scene', 'was', 'fine', 'then', 'film', 'got', 'progressively', 'slower', 'slower', 'was', 'depressing', 'George', 'professor', 'who', 'loss', 'lover', 'time', 'few', 'other', 'men', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'replace', 'take', 'George', 'mind', 'deceased', 'lover', 'goal', 'was', 'make', 'depressed', 'then', 'mission', 'accomplished', 'back', 'cover', 'story', 'romantic', 'tale', 'love', 'interrupted', 'ultimately', 'importance', 'seemingly', 'smaller', 'moments', 'life', 'Smaller', 'moments', 'got', 'right', 'So', 'much', 'time', 'was', 'spent', 'presenting', 'pointless', 'scenes', 'character', 'staring', 'something', 'someone', 'poor', 'dialogue', 'felt', 'never', 'understood', 'characters', 'got', 'know', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'can', 'not', 'recall', 'purpose', 'other', 'actors', 'were', 'pointless', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'extremely', 'boring', 'film', 'best', 'acting', 'was', 'lecture', 'hall', 'even', 'scene', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'played', 'similar', 'role', 'Savage', 'Grace', 'film', 'having', 'do', 'homosexuality', 'was', 'lot', 'more', 'interesting', 'one', 'only', 'interesting', 'part', 'entire', 'film', 'scene', 'where', 'George', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'started', 'talking', 'fear', 'lecture', 'analogies', 'were', 'off', 'are', 'other', 'movies', 'can', 'capture', 'hardships', 'love', 'loss', 'complexities', 'homosexual', 'relationships', 'lot', 'more', 'intriguing']",N/A

The waiting list at the Fine Arts Library was pretty long, but she eventually got it and we watched it that very night.  It left an impression.I've never read the Christopher Isherwood novel, but I enjoyed the movie.  The movie's strength is not the story, but the images it uses to tell that story.  Tom Ford's use of color and framing is very striking.Following the death of his partner (Matthew Goode), George (Colin Firth) intends to commit suicide.  The whole movie is muted by his grief, few things truly engaging his senses.  Firth does a wonderful job of portraying the character's emotional turmoil, hidden behind a strong front, and Ford's direction backs up his feeling.The other actors aren't given as much to do, but they're delightfully ambiguous.  Their motives and feelings aren't entirely clear to George or the viewer.  Julianne Moore plays Charley, George's best friend and one of the few people he wants to see on his last day.  The ridiculously gorgeous Nicholas Hoult plays Kenny, a student of George's who basically stalks him.  (Whenever I see About a Boy, I am amazed how goofy he looked as a kid.)A Single Man is very stylized and thus not for everybody.  It is not a warm film.  It has a very cold, mannered surface.  But it works because of the core of vulnerability that Firth embodies.  George's weakness is not easily seen, but it's very affecting.There's also a memorable moment of black comedy towards the end of A Single Man, as George tries to stage his suicide perfectly.  No matter how much he fusses, he can't seem to find a neat and dignified way to shoot himself.  It's a terrible thing to laugh at, but it's a perfect funny and sad scene.",4,Beautiful movie,1348531200,"09 25, 2012",2012,1790,"['then', 'roommate', 'movie-watching', 'buddy', 'R', 'had', 'been', 'dying', 'see', 'A', 'Single', 'Man', 'Tom', 'Ford', 'directorial', 'debut', 'waiting', 'list', 'Fine', 'Arts', 'Library', 'was', 'pretty', 'long', 'eventually', 'got', 'watched', 'very', 'night', 'left', 'impression.I', ""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'Christopher', 'Isherwood', 'novel', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'movie', 'strength', 'not', 'story', 'images', 'tell', 'story', 'Tom', 'Ford', 'use', 'color', 'framing', 'very', 'striking.Following', 'death', 'partner', 'Matthew', 'Goode', 'George', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'commit', 'suicide', 'whole', 'movie', 'muted', 'grief', 'few', 'things', 'truly', 'engaging', 'senses', 'Firth', 'wonderful', 'job', 'portraying', 'character', 'emotional', 'turmoil', 'hidden', 'strong', 'front', 'Ford', 'direction', 'up', 'feeling.The', 'other', 'actors', 'are', ""n't"", 'given', 'as', 'much', 'do', ""'re"", 'delightfully', 'ambiguous', 'motives', 'feelings', 'are', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'clear', 'George', 'viewer', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'Charley', 'George', 'best', 'friend', 'one', 'few', 'people', 'see', 'last', 'day', 'ridiculously', 'gorgeous', 'Nicholas', 'Hoult', 'Kenny', 'student', 'George', 'who', 'basically', 'stalks', 'Whenever', 'see', 'Boy', 'am', 'amazed', 'how', 'goofy', 'looked', 'kid', 'Single', 'Man', 'very', 'stylized', 'thus', 'not', 'everybody', 'not', 'warm', 'film', 'very', 'cold', 'mannered', 'surface', 'core', 'vulnerability', 'Firth', 'embodies', 'George', 'weakness', 'not', 'easily', 'seen', 'very', 'affecting.There', 'also', 'memorable', 'moment', 'black', 'comedy', 'end', 'A', 'Single', 'Man', 'George', 'stage', 'suicide', 'perfectly', 'No', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'find', 'neat', 'dignified', 'way', 'shoot', 'terrible', 'thing', 'laugh', 'perfect', 'funny', 'sad', 'scene']",N/A

The movie reflected subtly on this man's personality and his way of dealing with grief. It layered his character with the loss so well. The way he saw life thru flashbacks so you had an idea of who he was, not all of him, but his nuances. It is hard for me to describe him here because I saw the movie in the past and it is difficult to express. He seemed like he was living one moment at a time after his partner passed away. He was a thoughtful and organized person, yet he wanted to explore sentiment, but seemed restricted. This came out even in his happiness with his other. After the funeral he seems to be dissassociated from life, almost as if observing. He seemed to even be observing his own grief, logically dissecting what was happening without the emotion. He is a college professor and dallys with the thought of having a fling with a male student, who is intelligent and polite. He goes to have an intimate dinner party with an older glamourpuss who wants nothing more than to be his everything, yet all these things are meaningless more or less to him. He thinks of his love and of ending the controlled structure of life. He ponders fear and change with his students, yet remains quite centered and uninvolved with his surroundings. This film was very intense. The things I liked in it were the artistic setting, Julianne's makeup, hairstyle, her decor in the house, the colors that the film was softened in and the way the dining room looked out onto the ink blackness with creamy flowerbuds gentle and safe. I liked the intimacy she shared with Firth's character, her love of talking. I liked the way they danced and let go in each others company. I loved the architecture of his home and the isolated peace. The maid who helped him fix up his house and maintain his meals for him.

Druxman ""A Good Story is a Terribl...","[2, 2]","Adapted from a novel by Christopher Isherwood, A SINGLE MAN is an engrossing, bittersweet, often humorous, tale of loss, isolation and the discovery of what is important in life.  The fact that it deals with a gay man, in the days before people came ""out of the closet,"" has nothing to do with the film's basic message.  This story would have been just as viable had the protagonist been a heterosexual.George Falconer (Firth), as he goes through what he has determined will be his final day, not only recalls the loving relationship he had with his late partner (Matthew Goode), but he also begins to notice little things about his world and the people who inhabit it.  He, for example, compliments a secretary in the college's administration office on her pretty smile, and he takes some extra time to get to know his neighbor's bratty kids.Charley (Julianne Moore), his closest friend and long ago lover, is fighting her own sense of loss; her husband has left her and her son is grown and out of the house.  She would, desperately, like to woo George back to her, but it is a hopeless cause.It is only Kenny (Nicholas Hoult), a young student trying to come to terms with his own true nature, who might dissuade George from his fatal course of action.The film has an ending that is quite unexpected.Firth, Oscar-nominated for this picture, delivers a magnificently low-key performance.  He has no loud, emotionally charged scenes, yet he commands the screen with his eyes and subtle facial language.Ms. Moore is also very affecting in the role of George's hard-drinking friend, as are Goode and Hoult in their supporting assignments.A SINGLE MAN is a totally involving, positive look at the human condition and the importance of the seemingly mundane moments of life.

It's Friday, November 30, 1962, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, but George Falconer (Colin Firth), an expatriate English professor living in Southern California, is embarking on what he hopes will be the last day of an ongoing personal crisis. Eight months ago, his lover of 16 years, Jim (Matthew Goode), was killed in an auto accident. Every day since has been a haze. But George has decided that today will be different. Today he will kill himself. He lectures his English class on Huxley and has dinner with best friend Charley (Julianne Moore), but a persistent student named Kenny (Nicholas Hoult) has noticed George's cloud of gloom and decided the professor is worth knowing.With Tom Ford at the helm, I feared style over substance -and style that might be a bit tired. The photography and production design are a prominent element. I especially enjoyed George's modernist house tucked away in the post-War suburbs. George's meticulousness is reflected in the visual style, and it's easy to see what attracted Ford to this character. But style, though sometimes conspicuously prettified, does not overwhelm George's crisis or the audience's empathy. Much credit for that feat is due Colin Firth, who received a well-deserved Oscar nomination and BAFTA award for his role. His performance is understated -all in the face, really. Julianne Moore is also terrific. George's encounters with young men feel stilted. Stylistic flourishes and the film's score are sometimes heavy-handed. But ""A Single Man"" is well worth a viewing.The DVD (Sony 2010): Bonus features are ""The Making of A Single Man"" (16 min) and an audio commentary by Tom Ford. The documentary, which is black-and-white, interviews Ford about themes and the cast about their characters and Ford's direction. In the audio commentary, Tom Ford discusses the 21-day shoot, the ""overblown score"", characters, visuals, and explains his choices scene-by-scene.

Firth plays a British professor teaching at a university down in Los Angeles in 1962. He was married to a woman (played by Julianne Moore) for several years but he came to realize he was gay and so takes up a long term lover and loses him  (that's in the log line so that can't be a spoiler, people). The rest of this tale focuses on him coming to terms with the death of his lover and seeking clarity in a confusing world as a man's whose sexual tastes are seen as perverted (a bad word in the 60s unlike now in which opinions are mixed). Firth does a close to brilliant job as a philosophically depressed intellectual who still defaults to common emotions we all understand. The cinematic focuses are notable. Viewers who have issue with homosexuality should clearly skip this picture.This was Tom Ford's directorial debut and he financed the $7M budget which made a bit over $24M at the Box Office. Firth was nominated for Best Actor by the Golden Gloves, won the BAFTA for the same role and he and the film were nominated for several lesser known awards.

Let's think of another minority. One that... One that can go unnoticed if it needs to. There are all sorts of minorities, blondes for example... Or people with freckles. But a minority is only thought of as one when it constitutes some kind of threat to the majority. A real threat or an imagined one. And therein lies the fear. If the minority is somehow invisible and the fear is much greater. That fear is why the minority is persecuted. So, you see there always is a cause. The cause is fear. Minorities are just people. People like us.  ////// Carlos: No one has ever picked me up and not wanted something. George: I think you picked me up. This is kind of a serious day for me. Carlos: Come on. What could be so serious for a guy like you? George: I'm just trying to get over an old love I guess. Carlos: My mother says that lovers are like buses. You just have to wait a little while and another one comes along.  ////// George: [last lines; voiceover] A few times in my life I've had moments of absolute clarity, when for a few brief seconds the silence drowns out the noise and I can feel rather than think, and things seem so sharp and the world seems so fresh. I can never make these moments last. I cling to them, but like everything, they fade. I have lived my life on these moments. They pull me back to the present, and I realize that everything is exactly the way it was meant to be.  //// George: It takes time in the morning for me to become George, time to adjust to what is expected of George and how he is to behave. By the time I have dressed and put the final layer of polish on the now slightly stiff but quite perfect George I know fully what part I'm suppose to play.  ///// Jennifer Strunk: Would you like to meet Charlton Heston? He's our scorpion. Every night we throw in something new to him and watch him kill it. Daddy says it's like a Coliseum. Daddy says he wants to throw you into the Coliseum. George: No kidding. Why?

He has lost his male lover of 16 years to an auto accident, and he is quietly making plans to commit suicide in a manner that won't leave a terrible mess for his housekeeper.Set in 1962 Los Angeles, ""A Single Man"" resembles nothing so much as a Graham Greene story, describing a tightly-controlled expatriate Brit who has lived an ""invisible"" life, as the member of an unacknowledged minority.The problem with the movie is that ""there is no 'there' there"", (quoting Gertrude Stein speaking about the feeling of living in Los Angeles.)  Colin Firth does a good job acting, but still comes off as a pale shadow of a young Michael Caine.  Julianne Moore adds a little color and sports a British accent as George's friend, but she seems to be doing a version of Angie Dickinson.The movie is kind of a guide to ""how things were"" for a gay outsider in the early Sixties, and there are clever scenes, as when George flirts with another foreigner in Spanish. acknowledging their status.

Colin Firth is a fine actor and this definitely is one of the best roles of his career.

There is no rush to show one man's grief, his alianation from the world around him, loneliness that only in tiny spurs can be lifted by a dear friend who understands him as a human being, a mate and a countryman.  The exploration of possibility that we all live in our lonely world and perhaps only allow the people from the outside in.  Is it wrong for some of people to be that selective?

1291572,A3SHQXNOPZBJH,B002VECLVO,Robert Byrd,"[26, 93]","Being the fourth review posted so far of this film, I am definitely in the minority by proclaiming it a gigantic mess.  There is very little story here - the bulk of the film references the ""loving"" relationship between the Colin Firth character and his recently departed gay lover.  The only problem is, I did not buy the depth of their love for one another, nor Firth's response to his partner's death, basically because there seemed to be no real chemistry between the two men.  In addition, there was no narrative thread in the film's script that weaved together a believable or logical story line that compelled me to feel anything whatsoever for the characters.  Everything seemed so piecemeal and artificially stylized in this movie, which left me feeling completely cold when I should have felt great warmth in response to the characters and their suffering.  I also did not connect with Firth's relationships with his best friend (played by Julianne Moore) and his stalker student (whose mad pursuit of Firth made absolutely no sense).  Everything about this film felt contrived, including Colin Firth and Julianne Moore's acting (especially Julianne Moore's utterly ridiculous British accent), as well as the motivations of the two young men in hot pursuit of Colin Firth (both of whom, by the way, looked like New York runway fashion models).  A SINGLE MAN was one of the most forced, contrived, terribly written and poorly conceived first-time directing efforts I have ever seen.

1291573,A18TLRH5PKAS4S,B002VECLVO,Rodney Bucket,"[9, 11]","""A Single Man"" is an all-around beautiful film. It is visually beautiful, using its lighting and color palettes to their full potential to dazzling effect. The score, a slow, meditative, haunting orchestral arrangement by Abel Korzeniowski is also beautiful, and flows seamlessly with the cinematographic offerings of the film. But the true beauty in ""A Single Man"" lies in its characters, who are flawed and broken and striving to be human in this cold, cruel world in which we live.The film is mostly the story of one character, the titular single man, George, played flawlessly by Colin Firth. George is a college professor in California in the 1960s. George is gay in a time when being so is not particularly acceptable. George had a partner, Jim, who was the love and light of his life, until he perished in a car accident, and now George has nothing. George is a broken, hollow, empty man who is simply going through the motions.The film is almost a stream of consciousness, following George as he goes about a day in his life. They day is not unusually eventful: George teaches a lecture, goes to the bank, has dinner with an old friend. And yet the film revels in every minute of this man's life, observing him with a careful, watchful, nonjudgmental eye. The film focuses on George's interactions with everyone around him, and capture beautifully the distance and isolation George experiences from everyone else in the world. George is single not only in relationship status, but he feels ultimately and tragically alone, unable to form connections with anyone around him. The story in the film may seem light to some, and in many ways that is the point: this is an ordinary day in the life of an ordinary man. George is not some action hero, and this isn't an action-packed day from a season of ""24."" The film's beauty is in its subtlety and nuance, and the way Ford's camera patiently follows its characters in rapture, although nothing earth-shattering is happening, the focus of the film is on the little interactions that make up the human experience.The theme of homosexuality is handled very well here: this is not a movie that has any sort of political agenda, nor should it ostracize viewers of any sexual persuasion. The film is about raw human emotion, about love and loss and the grief every human being feels when he or she has lost someone important. The emotions George feels, the experiences he has are all part of a greater universal, the Human Experience. In perhaps the best crafted scene in the film, George goes swimming with another character, and in that silent, wordless moment as they're tossed about by the violent waves, there seems to be a greater level of understanding than there is between anyone in all the rest of the film, no matter how many words are exchanged. Perhaps that is the great unifier: the thing we have in common is that we are each of us alone in our search for understanding, and that the moments of human connection that come and go are what we live for. George's individual concerns, therefore, are not his alone, but shared by all of humanity.

1291575,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B002VECLVO,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 3]","In the ironically titled ""A Single Man,"" a movie based on the Christopher Isherwood novel of the same name, the protagonist George Falconer (Colin Firth) is a gay college professor whose partner of 16 years (Matthew Goode) has recently been killed in a car crash.  As it is 1962, George has lived almost his entire life in the closet - and now he's even being forced to grieve in isolation.  To make matters worse, his lover`s parents won`t allow George to attend the memorial service, and now he has to return to work acting as if nothing out of the ordinary has happened in his life - as if his heart had not just been ripped out of him by the thoughtless cruelty of an indifferent Fate.  The one person with whom George can be truly open and honest about himself is Charley (Julianne Moore), a longtime female friend who accepts his homosexuality but whose own conflicted feelings for the man greatly complicate their relationship.  Yet, George has his own conflicted feelings to deal with, when, in the depths of his despair, one of his young male students (Nicholas Hoult) begins to make romantic overtures to him.Rather than tell the story, which takes place over the course of a 24-hour period, in a strictly linear and straightforward fashion, Tom Ford, in his directorial debut, relies heavily on intense close-ups, visual tinting, voiceover narration, dream sequences, flashbacks, memories, imaginings and endless images of ticking clocks - signifying the slow but inexorable passage of time - to give a more fragmented and otherworldly quality to the story.  However, such an approach, impressive as it is at times, carries some risks with it as well - for the artiness frequently acts as a distancing device that prevents us from entering the mind and feelings of the protagonist as fully as we would like to.  That being said, the style does provide an interesting visual correlative to the life of secrecy and repression George is being forced to lead by a society that, still at that point, was not quite ready to accept anyone who might threaten its self-proscribed parameters of what, in its infinite wisdom, it chose to deem as ""acceptable"" and ""normal.""Oddly, with Firth's heavy British accent, the uncharacteristically deep-hued interiors and airless exteriors, this is one of the few movies set in L.A. that doesn't really feel like it takes place in L.A. (it's reminiscent of ""The Man From Elysian Fields"" in that regard).  Indeed, the movie has more of an East Coast/Old World European flavor to it that further works to dislocate the viewer.As an actor, Colin Firth has never before shown such intensity of purpose or subtlety of technique, playing a man whose outward actions are basically a shield for what is happening deep inside the soul of the character.  Firth conveys a wealth of meaning through random facial expressions and understated gestures, as he portrays a man coping with both the tragic loss of his one true love and the burden of conducting a lifelong masquerade to avoid offending the sensibilities of others.In form and in style, ""A Single Man"" is more a mood piece than a fully developed drama, with the Cuban Missile Crisis, which is taking place in the background, casting a portentous pall over the lives and futures of the people involved.  But it is through George's highly specific yet universal story that the film movingly conveys the tragedy of living a life so dedicated to being false to others that one can never be true to oneself.",4,Imperfect but impressive directoral debut,1281571200,"08 12, 2010",2010,3490,"['ironically', 'titled', 'Single', 'Man', 'movie', 'based', 'Christopher', 'Isherwood', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'protagonist', 'George', 'Falconer', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'gay', 'college', 'professor', 'partner', '16', 'years', 'Matthew', 'Goode', 'recently', 'been', 'killed', 'car', 'crash', '1962', 'George', 'lived', 'almost', 'entire', 'life', 'closet', 'now', 'even', 'being', 'forced', 'grieve', 'isolation', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'lover', 's', 'parents', 'won', 't', 'allow', 'George', 'attend', 'memorial', 'service', 'now', 'return', 'work', 'acting', 'nothing', 'ordinary', 'happened', 'life', 'heart', 'had', 'not', 'just', 'been', 'ripped', 'thoughtless', 'cruelty', 'indifferent', 'Fate', 'one', 'person', 'whom', 'George', 'can', 'be', 'truly', 'open', 'honest', 'Charley', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'longtime', 'female', 'friend', 'who', 'homosexuality', 'own', 'conflicted', 'feelings', 'man', 'greatly', 'complicate', 'relationship', 'George', 'own', 'conflicted', 'feelings', 'deal', 'when', 'depths', 'despair', 'one', 'young', 'male', 'students', 'Nicholas', 'Hoult', 'make', 'romantic', 'overtures', 'him.Rather', 'tell', 'story', 'place', 'course', '24-hour', 'period', 'strictly', 'linear', 'straightforward', 'fashion', 'Tom', 'Ford', 'directorial', 'debut', 'heavily', 'intense', 'close-ups', 'visual', 'tinting', 'voiceover', 'narration', 'dream', 'sequences', 'flashbacks', 'memories', 'imaginings', 'endless', 'images', 'ticking', 'clocks', 'signifying', 'slow', 'inexorable', 'passage', 'time', 'give', 'more', 'fragmented', 'otherworldly', 'quality', 'story', 'However', 'approach', 'impressive', 'times', 'risks', 'as', 'well', 'artiness', 'frequently', 'distancing', 'device', 'entering', 'mind', 'feelings', 'protagonist', 'as', 'fully', 'would', 'like', 'being', 'said', 'style', 'provide', 'interesting', 'visual', 'correlative', 'life', 'secrecy', 'repression', 'George', 'being', 'forced', 'lead', 'society', 'still', 'point', 'was', 'not', 'quite', 'ready', 'accept', 'anyone', 'who', 'might', 'threaten', 'self-proscribed', 'parameters', 'what', 'infinite', 'wisdom', 'chose', 'deem', 'acceptable', 'normal', 'Oddly', 'Firth', 'heavy', 'British', 'accent', 'uncharacteristically', 'deep-hued', 'interiors', 'airless', 'exteriors', 'one', 'few', 'movies', 'set', 'L.A.', ""n't"", 'really', 'feel', 'place', 'L.A.', 'reminiscent', 'Man', 'From', 'Elysian', 'Fields', 'regard', 'Indeed', 'movie', 'more', 'East', 'Coast/Old', 'World', 'European', 'flavor', 'further', 'works', 'dislocate', 'viewer.As', 'actor', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'never', 'before', 'shown', 'such', 'intensity', 'purpose', 'subtlety', 'technique', 'playing', 'man', 'outward', 'actions', 'are', 'basically', 'shield', 'what', 'happening', 'deep', 'soul', 'character', 'Firth', 'conveys', 'wealth', 'meaning', 'random', 'facial', 'expressions', 'understated', 'gestures', 'man', 'coping', 'tragic', 'loss', 'one', 'true', 'love', 'burden', 'conducting', 'lifelong', 'masquerade', 'avoid', 'offending', 'sensibilities', 'others.In', 'form', 'style', 'Single', 'Man', 'more', 'mood', 'piece', 'fully', 'developed', 'drama', 'Cuban', 'Missile', 'Crisis', 'taking', 'place', 'background', 'casting', 'portentous', 'pall', 'lives', 'futures', 'people', 'involved', 'George', 'highly', 'specific', 'yet', 'universal', 'story', 'film', 'movingly', 'tragedy', 'living', 'life', 'so', 'dedicated', 'being', 'false', 'others', 'one', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'true', 'oneself']",N/A

It reminded me that although gay/lesbians don't currently have all the civil rights of other Americans, that it was much worse just a few short decades ago.

1291578,A3II7VQOJ0Q1XD,B002VECLVO,"Shannon L. Yarbrough ""Shannon L. Yarbrough""","[0, 0]","I watched A Single Man last night with Colin Firth.  Well, I didn't ""watch"" it with him.  You know what I mean.  It's a bit of an artsy film whose DVD cover will deceive most idiots.  Way to go, Hollywood!  But honestly, the DVD cover is pure representation of what the movie is actually about.Colin Firth plays George Falconer, a teacher who loses his life partner, Jim, of seventeen years after he dies in a car accident.  George receives a phone call telling him what has happened and that he can't come to the wake because the service is for family only.  Just like that, his entire world is taken away from him and he finds himself alone, unable to accept what has happened and unable to mourn the love of his life.The movie shows flashbacks to loving moments in their life together, along with the night they first met.  While in present day, George ""prepares his papers"" and contemplates suicide.  The camera takes long looks into his eyes - blank and starring - which are so true and haunting that you can't help but feel the pain he must be experiencing.  The music and the silence only aid in conveying the message.Then there are conversations George has throughout the day with various people: a student of his who has taken up interest in him, a Spanish guido outside a market, a small child in a bank.  When these dialogues are taken place, the dull look to the movie sudden grows bright like a flower blooming, indications of happiness or truth that both George and the movie goer should be paying attention to.While George is on the bed contemplating what position to lie in while shooting himself, a scene that will make you wince as he tosses and turns with the gun in his hand, the phone rings.  It's his neighbor, Charlie (Julianne Moore) who is his best friend and all he has left in life as far as companionship goes.  He has a dinner date with her and while she longs for connection beyond their friendship, George refuses to accept their connection beyond what it already is.  He appreciates what she has given him, but she is bored with life too and eager to return to London.  He encourages her to go.  ""What are you doing this weekend?"" she asks him.  ""I'm going to be very quiet,"" he answers.  A sad moment between George and the viewer since Charlie has no idea what he really has on his mind.After going home, George reminisces of the night he first saw Jim and decides to return to the bar where they met.  The male student from campus walks in and he and George spark up a conversation that just may give George hope to keep living.  They go for a swim and return to George's place for the evening, but fate creeps in and reminds us we truly don't have control of our destiny.First, being a gay male, I related to this film in so many ways because I've been in a relationship for almost seven years now.  While both of our families are accepting of us and probably would not ban either of us from a hospital or funeral service, a lot of gay couples are not as fortunate enough to have such accepting and loving family members.  So, the pain that George is experiencing from such loneliness and loss plays out on the screen like a horror movie for someone like me, and Firth was very deserving of his Oscar nom that he got for it.Second, the movie explores the thought of loneliness that sadly is a way of life for most humans.  We are so starved for attention or a connection with someone else, but we continue to deny ourselves of such pleasure because we are either too stubborn or too blind.  In the film, George connects with different people all day long, some willing to fill in the gaps in his life temporarily or more permanent, but he can't see them because his mind his focused on only one thing.Like I said, the conflict of color in this movie is so striking and certainly sets the tone.  It's a constant battle between bleak and happy.  The music is trance like and numbing.  It is a sad reality for some of us that director Tom Ford feeds the viewer with shame and loneliness, like words of hurt that fall from our mouths before we can catch them.  It's the silence in the room when we learn someone is dead, when we only hear our heart beats and question if even our ears are deceiving us.What a beautiful and honest film!  Based on the novel by Christopher Isherwood, I'd love to hear what Chris would say about it.  He wrote it in 1964 but its underlying theme and message is more true today than ever.",5,What if you suddenly found yourself so alone in the world?,1279324800,"07 17, 2010",2010,4449,"['watched', 'Single', 'Man', 'last', 'night', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Well', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'bit', 'artsy', 'film', 'DVD', 'cover', 'will', 'deceive', 'most', 'idiots', 'Way', 'go', 'Hollywood', 'honestly', 'DVD', 'cover', 'pure', 'representation', 'what', 'movie', 'actually', 'about.Colin', 'Firth', 'plays', 'George', 'Falconer', 'teacher', 'who', 'life', 'partner', 'Jim', 'seventeen', 'years', 'car', 'accident', 'George', 'phone', 'call', 'telling', 'happened', 'ca', ""n't"", 'come', 'wake', 'service', 'family', 'only', 'Just', 'entire', 'world', 'taken', 'away', 'alone', 'unable', 'accept', 'what', 'happened', 'unable', 'mourn', 'love', 'life.The', 'movie', 'flashbacks', 'loving', 'moments', 'life', 'together', 'night', 'first', 'met', 'present', 'day', 'George', 'papers', 'suicide', 'camera', 'long', 'looks', 'eyes', 'blank', 'starring', 'are', 'so', 'true', 'haunting', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'pain', 'must', 'be', 'experiencing', 'music', 'silence', 'only', 'aid', 'conveying', 'message.Then', 'are', 'conversations', 'George', 'day', 'various', 'people', 'student', 'who', 'taken', 'up', 'interest', 'Spanish', 'guido', 'market', 'small', 'child', 'bank', 'When', 'dialogues', 'are', 'taken', 'place', 'dull', 'look', 'movie', 'sudden', 'grows', 'bright', 'like', 'flower', 'blooming', 'indications', 'happiness', 'truth', 'George', 'movie', 'goer', 'should', 'be', 'paying', 'attention', 'to.While', 'George', 'bed', 'contemplating', 'what', 'position', 'lie', 'shooting', 'scene', 'will', 'make', 'wince', 'gun', 'hand', 'phone', 'rings', 'neighbor', 'Charlie', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'who', 'best', 'friend', 'left', 'life', 'as', 'far', 'companionship', 'dinner', 'date', 'connection', 'friendship', 'George', 'accept', 'connection', 'what', 'already', 'what', 'given', 'bored', 'life', 'too', 'eager', 'return', 'London', 'go', 'What', 'are', 'doing', 'weekend', ""'m"", 'going', 'be', 'very', 'quiet', 'sad', 'moment', 'George', 'viewer', 'Charlie', 'idea', 'what', 'really', 'mind.After', 'going', 'home', 'George', 'reminisces', 'night', 'first', 'saw', 'Jim', 'return', 'bar', 'where', 'met', 'male', 'student', 'campus', 'walks', 'George', 'spark', 'up', 'conversation', 'just', 'may', 'give', 'George', 'hope', 'keep', 'living', 'go', 'swim', 'return', 'George', 'place', 'evening', 'fate', 'creeps', 'truly', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'control', 'destiny.First', 'being', 'gay', 'male', 'related', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'ways', ""'ve"", 'been', 'relationship', 'almost', 'seven', 'years', 'now', 'families', 'are', 'accepting', 'probably', 'would', 'not', 'ban', 'hospital', 'funeral', 'service', 'lot', 'gay', 'couples', 'are', 'not', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'have', 'such', 'accepting', 'loving', 'family', 'members', 'So', 'pain', 'George', 'experiencing', 'such', 'loneliness', 'loss', 'plays', 'out', 'screen', 'horror', 'movie', 'someone', 'Firth', 'was', 'very', 'deserving', 'Oscar', 'nom', 'got', 'it.Second', 'movie', 'thought', 'loneliness', 'sadly', 'way', 'life', 'most', 'humans', 'are', 'so', 'starved', 'attention', 'connection', 'someone', 'else', 'continue', 'deny', 'ourselves', 'such', 'pleasure', 'are', 'either', 'too', 'stubborn', 'too', 'blind', 'film', 'George', 'different', 'people', 'day', 'long', 'willing', 'fill', 'gaps', 'life', 'temporarily', 'more', 'permanent', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'mind', 'focused', 'only', 'one', 'thing.Like', 'said', 'conflict', 'color', 'movie', 'so', 'striking', 'certainly', 'tone', 'constant', 'battle', 'bleak', 'happy', 'music', 'trance', 'numbing', 'sad', 'reality', 'director', 'Tom', 'Ford', 'viewer', 'shame', 'loneliness', 'words', 'hurt', 'fall', 'mouths', 'can', 'catch', 'silence', 'room', 'when', 'learn', 'someone', 'dead', 'when', 'only', 'hear', 'heart', 'beats', 'question', 'even', 'ears', 'are', 'deceiving', 'beautiful', 'honest', 'film', 'Based', 'novel', 'Christopher', 'Isherwood', ""'d"", 'love', 'hear', 'what', 'Chris', 'would', 'say', 'wrote', '1964', 'underlying', 'theme', 'message', 'more', 'true', 'today', 'ever']",N/A

1291582,A3R8PXSFGY9MC2,B002VECLVO,Spider Monkey,"[1, 1]",`A Single Man' is the excellent directional debut from Tom Ford and this offers up an artistic and visual treat. This is set in the sixties and follows a gay school teacher as he struggles to come to terms with the death of his long time partner. He works his way through one last day before he contemplates his suicide so he can be with his lover again. His deep sadness is potent throughout and yet as he goes through his day various small events give him a sense of life's wonder and promise. This has some wonderfully framed scenes and the use of colours and camera angles make this a very polished affair. Firth is exceptional in this and the relationship with his friend Charley (played by Julianne Moore) makes for some funny and heart warming scenes. The use of music in this film really adds to the beauty of the direction and together they create a stunning film. This is relatively short at just over 90 minutes but it is very well crafted and has the prefect tempo for the story being told. Firth deserves every accolade he received for this film and if Ford continues making films like this then he will rapidly become a director of distinction and one worth keeping an eye out for in future. All in all this is a moving and visually stunning film.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.,4,A Single Man,1294531200,"01 9, 2011",2011,1330,"['Single', 'Man', 'excellent', 'directional', 'debut', 'Tom', 'Ford', 'up', 'artistic', 'visual', 'treat', 'set', 'sixties', 'gay', 'school', 'teacher', 'come', 'terms', 'death', 'long', 'time', 'partner', 'way', 'one', 'last', 'day', 'suicide', 'can', 'be', 'lover', 'again', 'deep', 'sadness', 'potent', 'yet', 'day', 'various', 'small', 'events', 'give', 'sense', 'life', 'wonder', 'promise', 'wonderfully', 'framed', 'scenes', 'use', 'colours', 'camera', 'angles', 'make', 'very', 'polished', 'affair', 'Firth', 'exceptional', 'relationship', 'friend', 'Charley', 'played', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'funny', 'heart', 'warming', 'scenes', 'use', 'music', 'film', 'really', 'beauty', 'direction', 'together', 'create', 'stunning', 'film', 'relatively', 'short', 'just', '90', 'minutes', 'very', 'well', 'crafted', 'prefect', 'tempo', 'story', 'being', 'told', 'Firth', 'accolade', 'received', 'film', 'Ford', 'making', 'films', 'then', 'will', 'rapidly', 'become', 'director', 'distinction', 'one', 'worth', 'keeping', 'eye', 'out', 'future', 'moving', 'visually', 'stunning', 'film.Feel', 'free', 'check', 'out', 'blog', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'profile', 'page']",N/A
1291583,A2ARRAMXWT83PT,B002VECLVO,Steven Adam Renkovish,"[7, 8]","A SINGLE MAN, the directorial debut of fashion designer Tom Ford, boasts one of the best performances of the year. It is a rich and involving character study that will be talked about for years to come, and has already garnered several major awards nominations this season.This extraordinary period piece opens in San Francisco in the year of 1962. The threat of nuclear war hangs in the air, and people are fearful of what the future may bring.George, a homosexual college professor, has just heard via telephone that his partner of sixteen years has been tragically killed in a car accident. Not only that, but George has found out six days after the fact. Only family will be invited to the funeral. Upon hearing this tragic news, George's life begins to crumble around him. In a fit of tears and agonizing emotional distress, George runs across the street to his best friend's house for comfort. Afterwards, he walks back home. As he sits alone in his room, contemplating his seemingly routine and ordinary life, George decides to commit suicide the following day.The day begins just like it always does. George goes through the motions of his daily morning ritual with all of the dedication of an obsessive compulsive individual. He eats breakfast, takes a shower, and gets dressed for work. Once out the door, he begins to reflect on the past and the present. He fondly recalls the first meeting between he and his lover, how they seemed destined to be together forever, and thinks of how dreary his life has become without him. He enters the classroom, and the fervor with which he addresses his class on this particular day catches the attention of one of his students, the twenty-year-old Kenny. The two of them begin to form a bond, and despite George's desire to end his life prematurely, this newfound friendship gives George a breath of hope.The performances are uniformly amazing. Colin Firth is mesmerizing as George. He crawls inside the skin of this character and brings him to vivid life in front of our eyes. We see the pain that George is experiencing. We read it on his face, and hear it in his voice. George is someone that we can sympathize with, because Colin Firth's dedication to the creation of this character is so powerful. Julianne Moore plays George's best friend, Charley. She is a woman who loves George dearly, and tries to help him through his loss as best she can. Moore crafts an eccentric character that is both selfish and undeniably comforting to Firth's George. Nicholas Hoult exudes a near-perfect balance of navete and world-weary angst as the young Kenny.Also notable in this film is the cinematography. Each image is meticulously framed and placed on the screen, with an appropriate mix of lushly filmed black and white and colored segments. It is a beautiful film to behold.

If it wasn't such a sad story - a gay British professor of English Studies at an American university in 1962 loses his partner in an auto accident and contemplates suicide and the end of his ""lonely"" life - it could be a fashion spread in a magazine. Ford (who co-wrote the script with David Scearce) frames every scene as if he is placing a photo in a magazine. He has obviously watched many films by European directors as you can see hints of Fellini and Godard and Bergman throughout.This is not a fast-advancing film. It moves slowly but it does draw you into want to know how it will end. (I won't be a spoiler and give away the ending.)Colin Firth is the title character and is on the screener at every moment through its 100-minute running time. This is his film. Julianne Moore, as his closest friend gets only a fraction of Firth's screen time but nearly equal billing. While she is good, she is no match for Firth. The film may mean more to gay men than a general audience but the subject of loneliness after looking a lover is universal.The images on the DVD are sharp and the sound is excellent. The subtitles - which appear at one point in the film - are in easy-to-read yellow typeface.Bonuses include a commentary track with Ford (which I did not evaluate) and the now requisite ""Making of Featurette"" with cast and crew.The Oscar nomination created a buzz for Firth's performance and the nom was well earned.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",4,Low-key (and often slow paced) film with an Oscar-worthy turn by Colin Firth in the title role.,1277856000,"06 30, 2010",2010,1546,"['Fashion', 'designer', 'Tom', 'Ford', 'making', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Oscar-nominated', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'such', 'sad', 'story', 'gay', 'British', 'professor', 'English', 'Studies', 'American', 'university', '1962', 'partner', 'auto', 'accident', 'contemplates', 'suicide', 'end', 'lonely', 'life', 'could', 'be', 'fashion', 'spread', 'magazine', 'Ford', 'who', 'co-wrote', 'script', 'David', 'Scearce', 'scene', 'placing', 'photo', 'magazine', 'obviously', 'watched', 'many', 'films', 'European', 'directors', 'can', 'see', 'hints', 'Fellini', 'Godard', 'Bergman', 'throughout.This', 'not', 'fast-advancing', 'film', 'slowly', 'draw', 'want', 'know', 'how', 'will', 'end', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'spoiler', 'give', 'away', 'ending', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'title', 'character', 'screener', 'moment', '100-minute', 'running', 'time', 'film', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'closest', 'friend', 'only', 'fraction', 'Firth', 'screen', 'time', 'nearly', 'equal', 'billing', 'good', 'match', 'Firth', 'film', 'may', 'mean', 'more', 'gay', 'men', 'general', 'audience', 'subject', 'loneliness', 'looking', 'lover', 'universal.The', 'images', 'DVD', 'are', 'sharp', 'sound', 'excellent', 'subtitles', 'appear', 'one', 'point', 'film', 'are', 'easy-to-read', 'yellow', 'typeface.Bonuses', 'include', 'commentary', 'track', 'Ford', 'did', 'not', 'evaluate', 'now', 'requisite', 'Making', 'Featurette', 'cast', 'crew.The', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'created', 'buzz', 'Firth', 'performance', 'nom', 'was', 'well', 'earned.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",N/A

1291588,A2NE9XC4XAE5HA,B002VECLVO,"Tom From NY ""Tom From NY""","[41, 114]","Fashion mogul Tom Ford, in his film directing debut, turns Christopher Isherwood's sharp little ""day in the life"" novel into a ""last day in the life"" film. Isherwood's George goes about his day, a day like any other, filled with the thousand little indignities and annoyances that flesh is heir to. Annoying children from next door, condescending neighbors, (mostly) uncomprehending students in his literature class, etc. George's Englishness and his homosexuality give him an outsider's view on life in Los Angeles, and Isherwood acts as an invisible nameless narrator, supplying some good observation about George and his milieu. Isherwood's George isn't having the best day; he seems to be aware that he's just going through the motions, almost on auto-pilot, and it seems to have something to do with his recently deceased partner of 16 years, Jim.In short, there isn't much plot in Isherwood's novel, and Ford can't be blamed for making George's seeming depression over the loss of his partner the focus of his film. Ford's George (played by Colin Firth, doing the best he can) is more than just bummed, he's actually preparing to kill himself. He leaves out the clothes he wants to be buried in, he prepares a series of Last Notes to assorted people, buys ammunition for the gun he keeps in his desk, and is shown throughout the day getting ready to check out once and for all.Okay, well and good, not necessarily a bad notion in and of itself. The problem is Ford's need to make each scene, each shot, each bloody frame even, into a big display of every known cinematic technique, ranging from simple things like slow motion to the more advanced gimmick of manipulating the color saturation in the image to convey George's emotional state. One of the most tasteless moments in the film occurs in a bar when George is approached by a young man, cuing the color to go from muted but natural tones (George is Sad) to bright vibrant full color (George is Horny). It comes off less as an instance of an interesting use of color than as an instance of Directorial Authority Run Amuck. Clearly, this film is an expression of STYLE over anything as mundane as mere Life. Ford can't bear to show any disorder in the world he brings to the screen, every image is faultlessly composed and immaculately lit, hermetically created for maximum glossy photo-spread effect. Even a display of plastic pencil sharpeners in college bookstore is carefully arranged, with the little plastic items arrayed in precise color-specific rows. A scene of George unable to pull the trigger of the gun he has in his mouth, evidently out of concern for the damage he'll do to his surroundings, at first comes off as just a spectcularly ill-advised bit of black comedy, but unexpectely winds up being emblematic of the entire film. Suicide is one thing, but mess will simply not be tolerated.There's more. It isn't enough for George to strike up an impromptu chat with one of his neighbor's children, whom he has unexpectedly met at the bank. The little girl has to have a stylish entrance, glimpsed in the reflection of an impossibly over-polished floor, followed by a slow shot travelling up her body from bottom to top, with music clearly inspired by Bernard Herrmann's score to VERTIGO on the soundtrack, yet. The entire movie is nothing but this kind of flourish, over and over and over, little nudges from Ford so we can applaud how ""cinematic"" his film is. The nudges start to bruise, before long, and the urge to nudge back can't be denied. The film feels completely unnatural and mechanical, so composed and created and finally phony that AVATAR comes off as a gay lark tossed off as an afternoon's merry diversion in comparison. It is difficult to give a damn about anyone in the film when they're just a bunch of carefully pretty immaculately groomed and dressed (and undressed) puppets. That this is true of even George's relationship with the late Jim (played by the pretty but useless Matthew Goode, who last annoyed as Ozymandias in WATCHMEN) is a particularly grave failing. The flashbacks we get of George and Jim together (reading in cozy domesticity, or sitting in carefully composed and overly styled B/W Bruce Weber-esque splendor on a picturesque outcropping of rock) are pretty standard romance novel stuff. There's no accounting for soul mates, I guess, but I think I'd have preferred not seeing Jim at all to the overly posed scenes we get here, which seem to have been cribbed out of an upscale gay magazine all-male resort ad.It all just thuds and plods along, with a ponderous funereal air that really gets oppressive. The film hasn't gotten the complaints that BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN got, that it offers too negative a view of Homosexuality As Misery, but I doubt that A SINGLE MAN will get enough popular attention to warrant many complaints. I'm tempted to dismiss the film as TERMS OF ENDEARMENT for the Project Runway crowd. I have to admit that I was glad to see an actor of Colin Firth's abilities being allowed to carry a film, one at least nominally intended for grown ups. To be fair, Firth's scene where he gets the Awful Phone Call about Jim's passing is most impressive, by far the most memorable thing in the film. But even Firth's performance falls into the black hole of Ford's style, as closeup after closeup of George displaying Subtle Emotions become as cloying as the film they had, up until then, been the best part of.",1,Suicide Is One Thing -- But Making A Mess Is Just Not Done,1265587200,"02 8, 2010",2010,5438,"['Fashion', 'mogul', 'Tom', 'Ford', 'film', 'directing', 'debut', 'Christopher',

1291589,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B002VECLVO,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[2, 3]","I had put off seeing this as there had been so much hype around it, that I felt it would not be able to live up to it all. I was happily proven wrong. This beautiful film is set in 1962, with the backdrop of the Cuban missile crisis and the first real societal awakening to the global threat of nuclear war. Whilst some people feel that man kind could be coming to an end, George (University Professor in California) played brilliantly by Colin Firth, has just lost his one true love in his boyfriend and can not see a reason to live.His boyfriend Jim dies in a car accident whilst visiting his parents and they do not even tell him about it. He is denied from attending the service and has to cope with living when he feels dead inside, eking out enough emotional strength through memories to sustain day to day existence. He has a best friend, who like him is an ex pat Brit Julianne Moore. She was and clearly is still in love with him and finds her strength in gin and the forlorn hope of a love rekindled with George.Some would call this lyrically paced, but I found it just moved along at the right speed to savour the whole thing. It is beautifully shot and stage, evoking the era in such a clear way that I got that it was the sixties immediately. There is so much attention to detail that you can tell it was a real labour of love. Tom Ford has made a film he can truly be proud of and we can be grateful to him. I often get miffed when straight actors play gay ones, when there are so many gay actors who never get a look in.

He has not taken his death lightly and we get a small glimpse of how bleak his existance is now. He goes through his daily routine as usual but there is quite a bit of foreshadowing as to what will happen. Is it predictable? Yes. But it doesn't detract from the wonderful performance by Colin Firth, who is perfection and elegance and melancholy all at the same time. He never overdoes it-in fact, I would call it understated, and yet, you can't help but feel morose and utterly depressed at his situation. This is not a pro-gay or anti-gay film. It never pretends to be more than it is. And that is why the simple nature may not be for people who like extensive drama or action. Or even plot. It is a very short film but it leaves an impression.Julianne Moore is a sort of mystery in this film as her part could have been played by anyone and she would not be missed. I do applaud her attempt at a British accent, for I will never forgive her for An Ideal Husband.... She appears to be a long-time friend of Firth's character, still maybe pining after him even after all the years he's been with his lover. Her character is almost unnecessary but there is a great scene between them towards the end where she says something that is inexcusable to Firth and the scene is both dramatic and heart-breaking without going overboard. There are very few other characters in the film because it really is all about Colin Firth. He is just magical.

Gordon ""StolenMoments""","[19, 54]","I have to agree with the naysayers on review of this movie:  it is sadly not at all what Mr. Isherwood's book conveyed. I read a discreetly located version of this book in 1966, I believe, and it was a stark read of a man's forelorn stream of conciousness regarding the loss of his lover, and how the world around him is now seemingly diffeent to him by this loss.  This movie is nothing like the book, save a few character's names and the setting in Los Angeles.  This movie is another man's (Mr. Tom Ford) copycat ideas from another man's (Mr. Isherwood) book.  I wondered if Mr. Isherwood were alive to tell, what his reaction might be to such a distasteful gleaming of one man's ideas turned into another man's ideas, with no regard to the orginal piece of work.  Mr. Ford has simply taken a storyline, and rewrote it --with the help of others-- to reflect his own life, as Mr. Ford does indeed state in the movie commentary.  When I first viewed the movie, I thought, 'Which book did Mr. Ford indeed read in order to base this drivel?'  After rewatching it the next evening with the commentary by Mr. Ford, I understood completely how this movie came to pass.  This is the egocentric audacity of Mr. Ford's vanity, upon which he took his own life instances, tossed out the bulk of Mr. Isherwood's story, and made a movie about Mr. Tom Ford: pretentious and lacking substance and story and feeling, to be quite frank.

1291595,A1XX1KKXH9W7I7,B002VECLVO,wolfgang731,"[55, 58]","This film took me by surprise.  Being that this was Tom Ford's directorial debut, I didn't know what sort of expectations, if any, I should have had.  That speculation was a profound waste of time.  I like a great many movies but I love only a handful and this one falls squarely in the center of the latter category.  I found it a profoundly lyrical and human exploration of the weight of loss, of the way we try to continue with a life that is now seemingly foreign because it is so jarringly incomplete; a study in reflective motion - the stranger in the mirror that shadows us.  We witness how from the moment he wakes, George struggles to just exist in the most normal sense rather than live in the more extraordinary one.  As he states early in the film ""You see, my heart has been broken.""  However, we not only see it, we come to feel it.  We are wholly sympathetic to him because, in many ways, he's all of us.  Just like his loss, George's pain is universal and through that hole in his soul, we enter and come to know him. Colin Firth's performance is superb; a walking testament to weary resignation and automatic reflex.  He operates by rote and instinct, struggling to reach the end of every minute of his day.  The clocks in his world move ever so slowly and the monotone tick of the seconds hand reminds him just how much more of the day still looms darkly before him.  Firth walks that very tricky tightrope with a character that can very easily become the embodiment of all that is maudlin while simultaneously failing to elicit even an ounce of compassion from the viewer.  Caricature is one misstep away but he doesn't come anywhere near that pitfall.  George is a sad creature, no doubt, but he's not pathetic; a dignified streak runs prominently through him.  To those outside his reality, he's the same George they've always known and he dutifully embraces the charade.  As his longtime friend, Charlotte (Charley), Julianne Moore delivers with her customary and unerring brilliance.  Donning a first rate English accent and a sense of frustration for her ill-conceived affection for George, she struggles alongside her friend to hold on to a world that is slowly leaving her behind.  Nicholas Hoult is a revelation as Kenny Potter, George's student; a young man whose own sense of isolation draws him to George and his detached and well thought out approach to life and human interaction.  In him he finds a kindred spirit.  As Jim, George's  partner of 16 years whom we get to know almost exclusively through flashbacks,  Matthew Goode offers an honest portrayal of someone whose capacity to love and be loved forever transfigured those around him.  Now let us move onto Tom Ford.  Where has this man been hiding all these years?  He was born to direct.  His unfailing attention to detail, his ability to frame a scene is fluid and innate.  People go to film school for years for one third of what obviously comes naturally to him.  From the first scene to the last, the film pulsates with a lyrical quality that renders it a true work of art and not just another movie.  He has certainly set the bar very high for himself.  Directorial debuts such as these, are rare indeed.  We're not talking Redford in Ordinary People because for more than 20 years he stood in front of the camera.  Ford's screenplay adapted from a source that many considered unfilmable is yet one more achievement.  The art direction is another major player in the film and it is spectacular, indeed.  Both interiors and exteriors brim with authenticity and impeccable taste.  The same is true of the music score by Abel Korzeniowski  and Shigeru Umebayashi.  Though somewhat minimalist in nature it was far warmer and more melodic with just the right amount of melancholy underpinnings.  Why this film wasn't showered with Oscar nominations I'll never understand because it more than deserves them.  To say that I loved it, is an understatement.  A Single Man is, without question, a true work of art.",5,"Haunting, lyrical - profoundly human",1266537600,"02 19, 2010",2010,4000,"['film', 'took', 'surprise', 'Being', 'was', 'Tom', 'Ford', 'directorial', 'debut', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'sort', 'expectations', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'speculation', 'was', 'profound', 'waste', 'time', 'like', 'great', 'many', 'movies', 'love', 'only', 'handful', 'one', 'squarely', 'center', 'latter', 'category', 'found', 'profoundly', 'lyrical', 'human', 'exploration', 'weight', 'loss', 'way', 'try', 'continue', 'life', 'now', 'seemingly', 'foreign', 'so', 'jarringly', 'incomplete', 'study', 'reflective', 'motion', 'stranger', 'mirror', 'witness', 'how', 'moment', 'George', 'just', 'exist', 'most', 'normal', 'sense', 'rather', 'live', 'more', 'extraordinary', 'one', 'early', 'film', 'see', 'heart', 'been', 'broken', 'However', 'not', 'only', 'see', 'come', 'feel', 'are', 'wholly', 'sympathetic', 'because', 'many', 'ways', 'loss', 'George', 'pain', 'universal', 'hole', 'soul', 'enter', 'come', 'know', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'performance', 'superb', 'walking', 'testament', 'weary', 'resignation', 'automatic', 'reflex', 'rote', 'instinct', 'struggling', 'reach', 'end', 'minute', 'day', 'clocks', 'world', 'move', 'ever', 'so', 'slowly', 'monotone', 'tick', 'seconds', 'hand', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'day', 'still', 'darkly', 'Firth', 'very', 'tricky', 'tightrope', 'character', 'can', 'very', 'easily', 'become', 'embodiment', 'maudlin', 'simultaneously', 'failing', 'elicit', 'even', 'ounce', 'compassion', 'viewer', 'Caricature', 'one', 'misstep', 'away', ""n't"", 'come', 'anywhere', 'pitfall', 'George', 'sad', 'creature', 'doubt', 'not', 'pathetic', 'dignified', 'streak', 'prominently', 'reality', 'same', 'George', ""'ve"", 'always', 'known', 'dutifully', 'charade', 'longtime', 'friend', 'Charlotte', 'Charley', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'delivers', 'customary', 'unerring', 'brilliance', 'Donning', 'first', 'rate', 'English', 'accent', 'sense', 'frustration', 'ill-conceived', 'affection', 'George', 'alongside', 'friend', 'hold', 'world', 'slowly', 'leaving', 'behind', 'Hoult', 'revelation', 'Kenny', 'Potter', 'George', 'student', 'young', 'man', 'own', 'sense', 'isolation', 'George', 'detached', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'approach', 'life', 'human', 'interaction', 'kindred', 'spirit', 'Jim', 'George', 'partner', '16', 'years', 'whom', 'get', 'know', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'flashbacks', 'Matthew', 'Goode', 'honest', 'portrayal', 'someone', 'capacity', 'love', 'be', 'loved', 'forever', 'transfigured', 'Now', 'let', 'move', 'Tom', 'Ford', 'Where', 'man', 'been', 'hiding', 'years', 'was', 'born', 'direct', 'unfailing', 'attention', 'detail', 'ability', 'frame', 'scene', 'fluid', 'innate', 'People', 'go', 'film', 'school', 'years', 'one', 'third', 'what', 'obviously', 'naturally', 'first', 'scene', 'last', 'film', 'lyrical', 'quality', 'true', 'work', 'art', 'not', 'just', 'movie', 'certainly', 'set', 'bar', 'very', 'high', 'Directorial', 'debuts', 'such', 'are', 'rare', 'indeed', ""'re"", 'not', 'talking', 'Redford', 'Ordinary', 'People', 'more', '20', 'years', 'stood', 'front', 'camera', 'Ford', 'screenplay', 'adapted', 'source', 'many', 'considered', 'unfilmable', 'yet', 'one', 'more', 'achievement', 'art', 'direction', 'major', 'player', 'film', 'spectacular', 'indeed', 'interiors', 'exteriors', 'brim', 'authenticity', 'impeccable', 'taste', 'same', 'true', 'music', 'score', 'Abel', 'Korzeniowski', 'Shigeru', 'Umebayashi', 'somewhat', 'minimalist', 'nature', 'was', 'far', 'warmer', 'more', 'melodic', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'melancholy', 'underpinnings', 'Why', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'showered', 'Oscar', 'nominations', ""'ll"", 'never', 'understand', 'more', 'say', 'loved', 'understatement', 'Single', 'Man', 'question', 'true', 'work', 'art']",N/A
