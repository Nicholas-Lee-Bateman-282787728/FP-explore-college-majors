Have students research the topic, have them prepare brainstormings and typed questions on the topic. Then watch the DVD in class (45 minutes) and follow up with a mixture of their general questions on the topic in-hand and questions drawn from the actual documentary.ii) Use only the topics that leave students lacking, as an in-class resource. This will cary from culture to culture, but in Japan the ones that performed this function best were: religion, abortion, working-poor and homosexuality.As a side-note these would also be excellent starting resources for conscientious families looking to broach important social issues with their childrenHowever you use these I think you will find success. Be sure, however, to remind students that these are not the metanarrative Truth, but merely one petit r&eacute;cit in a collective pluralist notion of what constitutes the truthS.",5,An outstanding Educational Resource,1360972800,"02 16, 2013",2013,1397,"['despise', 'medium', 'television', 'substitute', 'critical', 'education', 'are', 'certainly', 'instances', 'here', 'case', 'point', 'where', 'TV', 'documentaries', 'can', 'be', 'transposed', 'classroom', 'provide', 'additional', 'source', 'input.I', 'DVDs', 'sociology', ""'issues"", 'classes', 'University', 'Japan', 'have', 'had', 'nothing', 'success', 'them.For', 'educators', 'recommend', 'one', 'following', 'two', 'viewing', 'patterns', 'i', 'Use', 'episodes', 'have', 'once-per-week', 'class', '15-week', 'semester', 'Have', 'students', 'research', 'topic', 'have', 'prepare', 'brainstormings', 'typed', 'questions', 'topic', 'Then', 'watch', 'DVD', 'class', '45', 'minutes', 'follow', 'up', 'mixture', 'general', 'questions', 'topic', 'in-hand', 'questions', 'drawn', 'actual', 'documentary.ii', 'Use', 'only', 'topics', 'leave', 'students', 'lacking', 'in-class', 'resource', 'will', 'cary', 'culture', 'culture', 'Japan', 'ones', 'performed', 'function', 'best', 'were', 'religion', 'abortion', 'working-poor', 'homosexuality.As', 'side-note', 'would', 'also', 'be', 'excellent', 'starting', 'resources', 'conscientious', 'families', 'looking', 'broach', 'important', 'social', 'issues', 'childrenHowever', 'use', 'think', 'will', 'find', 'success', 'Be', 'sure', 'however', 'remind', 'students', 'are', 'not', 'metanarrative', 'Truth', 'merely', 'one', 'petit', 'r', 'eacute', 'cit', 'collective', 'pluralist', 'notion', 'what', 'truthS']",30 Days: The Complete Series
1332889,A3E5V5TSTAY3R9,B0038P1CXI,I'd rather be at the Beach,"[0, 0]","This is a great idea, but maybe the 1 hour time-limit per subject was the problem.  The first sequence, &#34;The Minimum Wage&#34;, had great dynamics with Morgan Spurlock and his fianc&eacute;.  They touched on the subject of Health Care for the working poor; it is outstanding if you are brought to the hospital needing a heart transplant, for example, because it will all be paid for as a life-threatening condition.  However, if you need preventive care, you may have to stand in line at the Free Clinic depending on the availability of physicians.  When Morgan had to go to the ER and subsequently received a bill for $551, he was incensed at what he thought was a ridiculous charge...how did he THINK the FREE heart transplants are paid for?  We can't afford to let hospitals close for lack of making enough money to cover expenses.Some of the other sequences lead to insights into leading a &#34;Green life&#34;, &#34;A Gay Life&#34;, &#34;An Illegal Immigrant Life&#34;, which really opened my eyes onto these lifestyles in a good way.  Then there were lackluster sequences which really needing expanding upon such as &#34;A Christian Life vs. Atheist&#34;, &#34;Binge Drinking Mom&#34;, &#34;Jail&#34; (what exactly was being exposed or what point was being made?), &#34;Anti-Aging&#34; in which a man took an unimaginable number of supplements every day until his liver almost shut down, etc.  For instance, in the &#34;Outsourcing&#34; episode, I learned a lot about living in India, but I'm not sure what the point was being made about &#34;Outsourcing&#34;.Morgan Spurlock is fascinating to watch, and I'm almost sure that if he starred in every episode we would have learned what point he was trying to get across.  Sadly, that didn't happen.  There are 18 episodes and about half of them either get their points across or I learned something new that made it worth the time.",3,"Great idea, Needed expansion",1363651200,"03 19, 2013",2013,1889,"['great', 'idea', 'maybe', '1', 'hour', 'time-limit', 'subject', 'was', 'problem', 'first', 'sequence', '34', 'Minimum', 'Wage', '34', 'had', 'great', 'dynamics', 'Morgan', 'Spurlock', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'touched', 'subject', 'Health', 'Care', 'working', 'poor', 'outstanding', 'are', 'brought', 'hospital', 'needing', 'heart', 'transplant', 'example', 'will', 'all', 'be', 'paid', 'life-threatening', 'condition', 'However', 'need', 'preventive', 'care', 'may', 'have', 'stand', 'line', 'Free', 'Clinic', 'depending', 'availability', 'physicians', 'When', 'Morgan', 'had', 'go', 'ER', 'subsequently', 'received', 'bill', '551', 'was', 'incensed', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'charge', 'how', 'did', 'THINK', 'FREE', 'heart', 'transplants', 'are', 'paid', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'let', 'hospitals', 'close', 'lack', 'making', 'enough', 'money', 'cover', 'expenses.Some', 'other', 'sequences', 'lead', 'insights', 'leading', '34', 'Green', 'life', '34', '34', 'A', 'Gay', 'Life', '34', '34', 'Illegal', 'Immigrant', 'Life', '34', 'really', 'opened', 'eyes', 'lifestyles', 'good', 'way', 'Then', 'were', 'lackluster', 'sequences', 'really', 'needing', 'expanding', 'upon', 'such', '34', 'A', 'Christian', 'Life', 'Atheist', '34', '34', 'Binge', 'Drinking', 'Mom', '34', '34', 'Jail', '34', 'what', 'exactly', 'was', 'being', 'exposed', 'what', 'point', 'was', 'being', 'made', '34', 'Anti-Aging', '34', 'man', 'took', 'unimaginable', 'number', 'supplements', 'day', 'liver', 'almost', 'shut', 'down', 'etc', 'instance', '34', 'Outsourcing', '34', 'episode', 'learned', 'lot', 'living', 'India', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'point', 'was', 'being', 'made', '34', 'Outsourcing', '34', '.Morgan', 'Spurlock', 'fascinating', 'watch', ""'m"", 'almost', 'sure', 'starred', 'episode', 'would', 'have', 'learned', 'what', 'point', 'was', 'trying', 'get', 'Sadly', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'are', '18', 'episodes', 'half', 'get', 'points', 'learned', 'something', 'new', 'made', 'time']",30 Days: The Complete Series
1332890,AZ4Q3VAK6CIJS,B0038P1CXI,Mary Esterhammer-Fic,"[7, 51]","Morgan Spurlock has made a career out of creating emergencies, and then filming them as ""reality"" shows. Most of his viewers apparently buy into his version of events because he reinforces stereotypes they already have, and they're happy to finally see their political agenda proven right.But Spurlock is nothing more than a propagandist--a transparent and heavy-handed one, at that.Take, for instance, his episode about living on minimum wage. Although I can't say that I personally have ever spent a month ""in stir,"" or that I ever lived as a Muslim for four weeks (the Muslim thing is something you can't do on a temporary basis anyway, because if you quit, you are an apostate and have to be put to death--that is, if you buy into what the Qur'an has to say on the subject). But I HAVE lived on minimum wage for more than thirty days, and frankly, it wasn't as horrible as Spurlock & Co. would have us believe. I mean, I wasn't living at the Hilton and ordering room service, but I wasn't sleeping under a cardboard box on a grate, either.Spurlock's approach is that living on minimum is so horrible because it is such a step DOWN from his lifestyle. He's making a six--or at this point, seven--figure salary. He has a huge amount of discretionary income, and he has no restrictions on where he can go. Guess what? That's an extreme exception! Of course he's suffering!He ends up getting a fairly decent apartment (which his pouty girlfriend calls ""home sweet hovel"") and, right away, lands a job.  Which he doesn't like because it's physically demanding and mind-numbing. Hmm. Well, that's how most jobs for the unskilled are, which is incentive to go out and get skills. But let's let that go for now, and assume that he's trying to create a scenario that would fit someone who has no skills and would never be able to acquire them.Then, he and his snobby I'm-so-irritated-at-Morgan-because-he-has-me-slumming girlfriend wind up with a total of three emergency room visits between them. The point is, they don't have insurance, which is their God-given right! But they bypass free clinics because of a long wait time. News flash: people WITH insurance--with HMO's--wait all day for appointments. When I was insured by an HMO--""the best in the country,"" so I was told--wait times of five, six, seven hours were not unusual.  And you couldn't make appointments in advance because the computers were always down. Morgan should have toughed it out at the free clinic with the long line--it would have given him insight into what's around the corner for ALL of us with socialized medicine, which I bet will be a lot like my former HMO.So: they're breaking even on their salaries, and then they throw themselves down the well of debt because of these faked ER visits. Why didn't they just cut to the chase and blow their wages at a casino boat? It would have been more fun.Oh yeah, they also screw up a night on the town and miss the last bus, so they're forced to get ferried home by taxi.  How many people take taxis? Not that many.  THEY'RE TOO EXPENSIVE. But Morgan and Miss Crabby Pants have to create some insurmountable problem that forces them to lose yet more money. ""Boo hoo hoo. I've made stupid budgeting decisions! Someone please come and help me!""Morgan's premise seems to be that EVERYONE is entitled to maintain a lifestyle HE considers normal. That's never been true. I have known many, many people during my life who have, for one reason or another, lived on minimum wage. If you find yourself in that income bracket and expect to live like someone making 50K/year, you're in for a shock. But if you make sound decisions, you can survive pretty well. For one thing,  a lot of people consolidate their incomes--minimal though they may be--and live as a community. This has always been how people survive, from medievel monastaries to the Great Depression. Morgan's idea that you're ENTITLED to your own lavish place with fabulous dining opportunities and reliable, comfortable transporation is a fantasy.People who have seriously limited means can still live well, if they make sensible decisions. But Morgan's approach is that of a guy who can only afford a used Toyota, reliable but not loaded, and then complains about how it's just not like the late-model Caddie he's used to.It would have been way more interesting if Morgan had approached the project with the idea that he would live those 30 days comfortably, if not like a king. He went into the situation already convinced that those 30 days would be hell--which it probably was for him, because he was saddled with that cry-baby girlfriend.When teachers assign these episodes to their students, I hope they're not just ""showing a slice of life."" I hope they're prefacing these alarmist stories with the question, ""What could have Morgan done to avoid these catastrophes?""",1,30 Days on Minimum Brains,1278892800,"07 12,
