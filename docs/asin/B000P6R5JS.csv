Madlax, and 3. El Cazador. All three DVD sets hit the bulls eye and are really good purchases. Madlax has some really good music in it too. The only thing I could argue with in Madlax is the price on it being a bit higher than the other two. But even with that, money well spent!!",5,Another good set.,1317513600,"10 2, 2011",2011,422,"['Second', 'set', 'girls', 'guns', 'trilogy', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'third', 'ranking', 'series', 'sets', 'set', '1', 'Noir', '2', 'Madlax', '3', 'El', 'Cazador', 'three', 'DVD', 'sets', 'hit', 'bulls', 'eye', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'purchases', 'Madlax', 'really', 'good', 'music', 'too', 'only', 'thing', 'could', 'argue', 'Madlax', 'price', 'being', 'bit', 'higher', 'other', 'two', 'even', 'money', 'well', 'spent']",Madlax: The Complete Collection

I don't want to  give the story away but the jist of it differs greatly with Madlax and Margaret and the secret relationship between them which you of course won't really find out until the last few episodes of the series.I can tell you that the collection comes in anamorphic widescreen and comes in 5.1 english surrond or 2.0 japanese audioUnlike Gunslinger girl this series does give you a reasonable ending so you.I like to do more of an update on what I feel about this series.  The series itself was made by the same people who gave us the anime series Noir.  And while you have two mysterious females with an unknown past they just don't seem to make the same connection or camaraderie you had with the characters Kirika Yumura and Mireille Bouquet from Noir did.  The Madlax series is also a little confusing on the ultimate agendas and ideals the main villain has in the series so you might have to watch a couple of episodes again to figure it out.  Also some people try to point out the similarity between the two main female characters from Madlax and Noir.  I feel there wasn't to much similarity at all  Mireille seemed more serious and deadly during her jobs than Madlax did,  and Kirika was a lot more worldly than Margaret is and how things really are in the world.  The series Noir was incredible and the creators tried to duplicate the same greatness but it seems this series was a little more tamer though.  The series is still good though and if you like action and suspense animes this is a good choice but don't expect it to equal the Noir anime series....",5,Copy of Noir somewhat but still great,1184544000,"07 16, 2007",2007,1772,"['ordered', 'collection', 'ADV', 'films', 'have', 'found', 'be', 'one', 'great', 'anime', 'yes', 'are', 'similar', 'areas', 'Madlax', 'Noir', 'storyline', 'animation', 'are', 'still', 'superb', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'story', 'away', 'jist', 'greatly', 'Madlax', 'Margaret', 'secret', 'relationship', 'course', 'wo', ""n't"", 'really', 'find', 'out', 'last', 'few', 'episodes', 'series.I', 'can', 'tell', 'collection', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', '5.1', 'english', 'surrond', '2.0', 'japanese', 'audioUnlike', 'Gunslinger', 'girl', 'series', 'give', 'reasonable', 'ending', 'so', 'you.I', 'do', 'more', 'update', 'what', 'feel', 'series', 'series', 'was', 'made', 'same', 'people', 'who', 'gave', 'anime', 'series', 'Noir', 'have', 'two', 'mysterious', 'females', 'unknown', 'past', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'make', 'same', 'connection', 'camaraderie', 'had', 'characters', 'Kirika', 'Yumura', 'Mireille', 'Bouquet', 'Noir', 'did', 'Madlax', 'series', 'also', 'little', 'confusing', 'ultimate', 'agendas', 'ideals', 'main', 'villain', 'series', 'might', 'have', 'watch', 'couple', 'episodes', 'again', 'figure', 'out', 'Also', 'people', 'try', 'point', 'out', 'similarity', 'two', 'main', 'female', 'characters', 'Madlax', 'Noir', 'feel', 'there', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'similarity', 'Mireille', 'seemed', 'more', 'serious', 'deadly', 'jobs', 'Madlax', 'did', 'Kirika', 'was', 'lot', 'more', 'worldly', 'Margaret', 'how', 'things', 'really', 'are', 'world', 'series', 'Noir', 'was', 'incredible', 'creators', 'tried', 'duplicate', 'same', 'greatness', 'series', 'was', 'little', 'more', 'tamer', 'series', 'still', 'good', 'like', 'action', 'suspense', 'animes', 'good', 'choice', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'equal', 'Noir', 'anime', 'series']",Madlax: The Complete Collection
1068725,A10U58PHFDK81C,B000P6R5JS,The Anime  Adict,"[12, 21]","Well know where to begin? Madlax is a rather unquic story about an orpahned millenare heiress named Margret Burton whom lives in a peaceful country that resemples France or Itally and a young amazingly skilled female mercinary named Madlax that lives in a war torn central American country. How are these two contected? Why are they even in the same story those are but a few of the questions the series posses.Let me start off with the good. The formost of the good colemn has to most definately be the animation and artwork. Both are top natched, both still shoots and movement are portrayed smoothly and edge on being called pretty. The voice acting is also quite good as everyone suits their parts and do an admirable job at their parts. The characters developement that does happen in the series is quiet good and interesting to a degree. Lastly in this collem is the music. Like Noir, this ones sister series of sorts the music is some of the best around.Alright did anybody notice that the plus collem was rather small this time? Well you're about to find out why. The first and most jaring flaw I have to pick at is the series almost instiance on sad endings. Every character meets with a less then happy ending. As a person who loves happy endings, or sad endings when they fit, this anoys me to no end. Next I have to say is that the series tries to hard to pres the mystery and suspense factor to the point where you just don't care. Next is the Character Developement, which is greatly neglected in this series. Many of the characters I would have loved to know more about but sadly am never allowed. This series focuses almost exclusively on its plot. Which wouldn't be a bad things if by the time the plot actually started to reveal itself make become interesting I was bordering on not caring anymore. In short the pacing of the series is just to slow. Not enough is going on to keep you interested. Lastly the few action scenes that there was in the series were badly chorographed, came across as overly thought out and some just bizare. Considering this is an action series as well as a mystery series I was expecting to be impressed by more then one fight in the entire thing.In the end Madlax plays out like Noir's red head little brother that no one cares about. My advice is if you don't have Noir or have not seen it do so, its a much better series. If you have seen Noir but still want better then average girl's wth guns that just happen have a brain stuff, well those are in short supply and next to Noir this is the best. Still I cannot bring myself to suggest everyone to buy this series. Again I have trouple supporting buying this one, there are such better series out there for this genre. If you want girl's with guns with brains get Noir. If you want girls with guns cool action, get Burst Angle. And if you want girls with guns that make you feel get Gun Slinger Girl. If have all those and can snag this for less the 30$ get it, if not, well you can forget this even exists and you won't miss much.",3,Ummmm,1229990400,"12 23, 2008",2008,3032,"['Well', 'know', 'where', 'begin', 'Madlax', 'rather', 'unquic', 'story', 'orpahned', 'millenare', 'heiress', 'named', 'Margret', 'Burton', 'whom', 'peaceful', 'country', 'France', 'Itally', 'young', 'amazingly', 'skilled', 'female', 'mercinary', 'named', 'Madlax', 'war', 'torn', 'central', 'American', 'country', 'How', 'are', 'two', 'contected', 'Why', 'are', 'even', 'same', 'story', 'are', 'few', 'questions', 'series', 'posses.Let', 'start', 'off', 'good', 'formost', 'good', 'colemn', 'most', 'definately', 'be', 'animation', 'artwork', 'are', 'top', 'natched', 'still', 'shoots', 'movement', 'are', 'portrayed', 'smoothly', 'edge', 'being', 'called', 'pretty', 'voice', 'acting', 'also', 'quite', 'good', 'everyone', 'suits', 'parts', 'do', 'admirable', 'job', 'parts', 'characters', 'developement', 'happen', 'series', 'quiet', 'good', 'interesting', 'degree', 'Lastly', 'collem', 'music', 'Noir', 'ones', 'sister', 'series', 'sorts', 'music', 'best', 'around.Alright', 'did', 'anybody', 'notice', 'plus', 'collem', 'was', 'rather', 'small', 'time', 'Well', ""'re"", 'find', 'out', 'why', 'first', 'most', 'jaring', 'flaw', 'have', 'pick', 'series', 'almost', 'instiance', 'sad', 'endings', 'character', 'less', 'then', 'happy', 'ending', 'person', 'who', 'happy', 'endings', 'sad', 'endings', 'when', 'fit', 'end', 'Next', 'have', 'say', 'series', 'hard', 'pres', 'mystery', 'suspense', 'factor', 'point', 'where', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'Next', 'Character', 'Developement', 'greatly', 'neglected', 'series', 'Many', 'characters', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'know', 'more', 'sadly', 'am', 'never', 'allowed', 'series', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'plot', 'Which', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'bad', 'things', 'time', 'plot', 'actually', 'started', 'reveal', 'make', 'become', 'interesting', 'was', 'bordering', 'not', 'caring', 'anymore', 'short', 'pacing', 'series', 'just', 'slow', 'Not', 'enough', 'going', 'keep', 'interested', 'Lastly', 'few', 'action', 'scenes', 'was', 'series', 'were', 'badly', 'chorographed', 'came', 'overly', 'thought', 'out', 'just', 'bizare', 'Considering', 'action', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'mystery', 'series', 'was', 'expecting', 'be', 'impressed', 'more', 'then', 'one', 'fight', 'entire', 'thing.In', 'end', 'Madlax', 'out', 'Noir', 'red', 'head', 'little', 'brother', 'one', 'advice', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'Noir', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'do', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'series', 'have', 'seen', 'Noir', 'still', 'want', 'better', 'then', 'average', 'girl', 'wth', 'just', 'happen', 'have', 'brain', 'stuff', 'well', 'are', 'short', 'supply', 'next', 'Noir', 'best', 'Still', 'can', 'not', 'bring', 'suggest', 'everyone', 'buy', 'series', 'Again', 'have', 'trouple', 'supporting', 'buying', 'one', 'are', 'such', 'better', 'series', 'there', 'genre', 'want', 'girl', 'guns', 'brains', 'get', 'Noir', 'want', 'girls', 'guns', 'cool', 'action', 'get', 'Burst', 'Angle', 'want', 'girls', 'guns', 'make', 'feel', 'get', 'Gun', 'Slinger', 'Girl', 'have', 'can', 'snag', 'less', '30', 'get', 'not', 'well', 'can', 'forget', 'even', 'wo', ""n't"", 'miss', 'much']",Madlax: The Complete Collection
