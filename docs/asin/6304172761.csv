I'd been wanting to see this show for the longest time and I kept searching for this title on Netflix with no success. FINALLY found it on Amazon!! I very much enjoyed Norma Jean and Marilyn except for one tiny, little annoying thing...Mira Sorvino was totally wrong for the part of Marilyn. Just wrong!! Ashley Judd, who plays the unknown Norma Jean, MADE me BELIEVE in her role. Judd's performance was excellent and I fell in love with her version of Norma Jean. The way Judd played NJ is pretty much the way I envisioned her in the early portions of MM's life. There isn't anything new to learn in this film about the life of Marilyn Monroe but it was exciting (and painful) to watch it all play out in front of me. I was totally enthralled with the first half of this movie and couldn't wait for Norma Jean to become Marilyn. I was anxious to see how Sorvino would bring her version of Marilyn to life. Cut to scene where Norma Jean is about to be transformed into the world's sexiest woman with the famous moniker. When I first see Sorvino as MM, my immediate reaction is NO!! How could they have cast her with such horrible hair? The real MM would have NEVER come out of her dressing room with hair like THAT!! And the teeth? When Sorvino smiled, what was supposed to be Marilyn's famous, sexy smile, it was ALL WRONG!! The only thing Sorvino may have gotten a tiny bit right was the Marilyn walk. To be fair, only Marilyn could do that famous signature wiggly-walk, and the signature smile, with the signature style. It was a persona that Norma Jean created and could turn off and on whenever she wanted. Now then, so I am clear and do not dissuade anyone from watching/purchasing this movie, even with the so-so portrayal of MM, this is still a must-see for fans of Marilyn. In my opinion, this was a pretty decent flick and I eventually accepted Sorvino's role. Afterall, I did give it 4 stars for something.

405271,A2NA9CGPX4KJ1U,6304172761,"R. Smith ""bookworm""","[0, 0]","Oh, Marilyn...an icon if ever there was one.  This is one of those movies that people either love or hate.  I happen to love it.  Ashley Judd delivers a riveting portrayal of Norma Jeane Baker, the fiery brunette vixen driven to overcome her traumatic childhood and succeed on the silver screen.  Judd is at the prime of her beauty in this film and her resemblance to young Norma Jeane is uncanny at times.  She is simply gorgeous and her acting was superb...viewers can gain some insight into Norma Jeane's ambition, her desire to rise to the top and finally be &#34;somebody&#34;.  Some people have criticized how Marilyn is portrayed in this film but one must realize that Hollywood can be a brutal place and it took a lot to achieve the success that she did. They must also understand that while much of the film is accurate, some of it was also taken from a book by Ted Jordan, who claimed that he was Monroe's lover in the 1940's.  Some of his claims about her are dubious (read the book to know what I'm talking about) but some of it rings true.I love that they stayed true to some things about Marilyn...when she first went blonde in 1946, being sent to the orphanage as a child, and a few other things.  I also found my eyes welling up with tears at the scene where she takes on her new identity as Marilyn Monroe...something about that scene is just so powerfully haunting in ways I can't explain.  Anyone who has ever struggled with depression, low self-esteem, abuse, rejection, or abandonment will see themselves in this particular scene.  Mira Sorvino is now Marilyn and although she does a wonderful job, her appearance is the only issue for me.  I find her more believable as Marilyn than I do with Michelle Williams (&#34;My Week with Marilyn&#34;) but still...she is a bit too tall and although definitely a pretty girl, something is missing.  But I guess no one can really do Marilyn justice...those are big shoes to fill.  And the final scene is obviously dramatized because Marilyn did not die that way.I've been a fan of Marilyn since the age of 13 and I have nearly every book written about her.  A bit obsessive, maybe, but she is the quintessential icon to me...her story is tragic but it is also about dreams and determination and in a sense, rebirth.  Monroe underwent a transformation and to this day she endures.  She died at 36 but her magic remains.  I love that this movie captures both sides of who she was...not only a blonde bombshell but a complex individual tormented by inner demons.  No matter how she tried, she couldn't escape the ghosts of her past.  Marilyn is a lot like Dorothy Dandridge, another famous woman of that era who died under mysterious circumstances in 1965.  Both of them possessing talent and beauty, yet enduring hardships (sexism and mental illness for Monroe, sexism/racism in the case of Dandridge).Not only does this film show the Marilyn most people are familiar with, all blonde hair and red lips and tight dresses...it shows the lesser-known Norma Jeane, the sad little girl with big dreams and the desire to leave her painful past behind.  Some people feel that this is an unflattering portrait of Marilyn's character and who she was, but it might actually be very close to the truth.  She suffered from bipolar disorder and numerous physical ailments and she was haunted by a deep insecurity that caused her to work at being close to perfect.  Judd and Sorvino are actually showing two sides of her, which calls to mind Elton John's line &#34;goodbye Norma Jeane&#34; in his song &#34;Candle in the Wind&#34;.  The cost of fame meant that Marilyn had to say goodbye to Norma Jeane, her former self, because Norma Jeane was a reminder of being unwanted and feeling unloved.All in all, definitely worth watching.  I just wish I could find another great movie about Marilyn on DVD...I believe it was called &#34;The Untold Story&#34; and it stars Catherine Hicks as Marilyn.",5,Compelling insight into the psyche of a legend,1396051200,"03 29, 2014",2014,3940,"['Oh', 'Marilyn', 'icon', 'ever', 'was', 'one', 'one', 'movies', 'people', 'love', 'hate', 'happen', 'love', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'riveting', 'portrayal', 'Norma', 'Jeane', 'Baker', 'fiery', 'brunette', 'vixen', 'driven', 'overcome', 'traumatic', 'childhood', 'succeed', 'silver', 'screen', 'Judd', 'prime', 'beauty', 'film', 'resemblance', 'young', 'Norma', 'Jeane', 'uncanny', 'times', 'simply', 'gorgeous', 'acting', 'was', 'superb', 'viewers', 'can', 'gain', 'insight', 'Norma', 'Jeane', 'ambition', 'desire', 'rise', 'top', 'finally', 'be', '34', 'somebody', '34', 'people', 'have', 'criticized', 'how', 'Marilyn', 'portrayed', 'film', 'one', 'must', 'realize', 'Hollywood', 'can', 'be', 'brutal', 'place', 'took', 'lot', 'achieve', 'success', 'did', 'must', 'also', 'understand', 'much', 'film', 'accurate', 'was', 'also', 'taken', 'book', 'Ted', 'Jordan', 'who', 'claimed', 'was', 'Monroe', 'lover', '1940', 'claims', 'are', 'dubious', 'read', 'book', 'know', 'what', ""'m"", 'talking', 'true.I', 'love', 'stayed', 'true', 'things', 'Marilyn', 'when', 'first', 'went', 'blonde', '1946', 'being', 'sent', 'orphanage', 'child', 'few', 'other', 'things', 'also', 'found', 'eyes', 'welling', 'up', 'tears', 'scene', 'where', 'new', 'identity', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'something', 'scene', 'just', 'so', 'powerfully', 'haunting', 'ways', 'ca', ""n't"", 'explain', 'Anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'struggled', 'depression', 'low', 'self-esteem', 'abuse', 'rejection', 'abandonment', 'will', 'see', 'particular', 'scene', 'Mira', 'Sorvino', 'now', 'Marilyn', 'wonderful', 'job', 'appearance', 'only', 'issue', 'find', 'more', 'believable', 'Marilyn', 'do', 'Michelle', 'Williams', '34', 'Week', 'Marilyn', '34', 'still', 'bit', 'too', 'tall', 'definitely', 'pretty', 'girl', 'something', 'missing', 'guess', 'one', 'can', 'really', 'do', 'Marilyn', 'justice', 'are', 'big', 'shoes', 'fill', 'final', 'scene', 'obviously', 'dramatized', 'Marilyn', 'did', 'not', 'die', 'way.I', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'Marilyn', 'age', '13', 'have', 'nearly', 'book', 'written', 'bit', 'obsessive', 'maybe', 'quintessential', 'icon', 'story', 'tragic', 'also', 'dreams', 'determination', 'sense', 'rebirth', 'Monroe', 'underwent', 'transformation', 'day', 'died', '36', 'magic', 'love', 'movie', 'sides', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'blonde', 'bombshell', 'complex', 'individual', 'tormented', 'inner', 'demons', 'matter', 'how', 'tried', 'could', ""n't"", 'escape', 'ghosts', 'past', 'Marilyn', 'lot', 'Dorothy', 'Dandridge', 'famous', 'woman', 'era', 'who', 'died', 'mysterious', 'circumstances', '1965', 'possessing', 'talent', 'beauty', 'yet', 'enduring', 'hardships', 'sexism', 'mental', 'illness', 'Monroe', 'sexism/racism', 'case', 'Dandridge', 'only', 'film', 'show', 'Marilyn', 'most', 'people', 'are', 'familiar', 'blonde', 'hair', 'red', 'lips', 'tight', 'dresses', 'lesser-known', 'Norma', 'Jeane', 'sad', 'little', 'girl', 'big', 'dreams', 'desire', 'leave', 'painful', 'past', 'behind', 'people', 'feel', 'unflattering', 'portrait', 'Marilyn', 'character', 'who', 'was', 'might', 'actually', 'be', 'very', 'close', 'truth', 'suffered', 'bipolar', 'disorder', 'numerous', 'physical', 'ailments', 'was', 'haunted', 'deep', 'insecurity', 'caused', 'work', 'being', 'close', 'perfect', 'Judd', 'Sorvino', 'are', 'actually', 'showing', 'two', 'sides', 'mind', 'Elton', 'John', 'line', '34', 'goodbye', 'Norma', 'Jeane', '34', 'song', '34', 'Candle', 'Wind', '34', 'cost', 'fame', 'meant', 'Marilyn', 'had', 'say', 'goodbye', 'Norma', 'Jeane', 'former', 'self', 'Norma', 'Jeane', 'was', 'reminder', 'being', 'unwanted', 'feeling', 'unloved.All', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'just', 'wish', 'could', 'find', 'great', 'movie', 'Marilyn', 'DVD', 'believe', 'was', 'called', '34', 'Untold', 'Story', '34', 'Catherine', 'Hicks', 'Marilyn']",Norma Jean & Marilyn VHS
