Peterson ""I'm not blind drunk, I'm j...","[1, 1]","I've been a fan of Beavis and Butthead since I was thirteen or so, and while I am in complete and total agreement about the fact that Mike Judge needs to like, uh, get up off his butt and like release the whole show on DVD, I don't believe the Mike Judge collections are the travesties that most reviewers on here seem to feel they are. I recently ordered all three from Amazon and while I haven't yet received volume 2 I have 1 and 3, and I must say I haven't laughed so much or so hard in a long time. Without exception I've liked every episode in these collections so far. Only a couple of my favorites were omitted, those being Beard BOys and Hard Sell. As for the videos, I did have a few favorites but I was more interested in the cartoons themselves, so the absence of all but a few videos from these collections isn't much a blow for me. About the only video I was disappointed not to find on this collection was Nightmares by Violent Femmes, mainly because of how Beavis freaked every time he heard the word Suck.Volume three is packed full of many of my favorites. I'll list just a few here.Vaya Con Cornholio: Beavis' alter ego resurfaces after he consumes the entire supply of Burger World's new soda. Unfortunately, an idiotic agent from the INS happens to drop in during the episode and Beavis is accidentally deported to Mexico while the agent and his superiors try to make sense of the gibberish that is Cornholio.Just for Girls: THe duo watch a sex ed film aimed at young girls and discover that the subject isn't nearly as fascinating as they'd thought.Follow me: Beavis mimicks everything Butthead says or does with predictable results.Huh-huh-humbug: In a parody of Charles Dickens' A CHristmas Carrol, Beavis is the tyranical manager of Burger World and Principal McVicker plays the role of the unfortunate Bob Cratchet. After leaving a disgruntled McVicker in Butthead's care, Beavis goes home and is visited first by a ghostly Butthead, then by three spirits. Tom Anderson represents Christmas Past, Mr. Van Dreson is CHristmas Present and Mr. Buzzcut is CHristmas Future.It's a Miserable Life: In response to the prayers of the people of HIghland, God sends Charlie, the boys' guardian angel, to kill them. When the attempt fails, he attempts to persuade Butthead to off himself by showing him what Highland would be like had he never been born.Substitute:After Mr. Van Dreson accidentally injures himself while attempting to demonstrate a Yoga position to the class, the substitute who replaces him inspires everyone save the titular duo.Sprout: Mr. Van Dreson gives the class a project to grow their own food. The boys attempt to grow corn to make their own nachos with less than satisfactory results.Buy Beer: After a guest lecture at their school about the dangers of alcohol addiction, the duo predictably get the wrong idea and attempt to get booz by attending an AA meeting, with disastrous results for their fellow attendees.Bride of Butt Head: In a further attempt to score, Butthead gets a mail order Russian bride. Unfortunately she is less than pleased with the arrangement...Graduation: Concerned by the students' lack of self-esteem, Van Dreson holds a mock graduation ceremony to prepare them for the big event. Unfortunately, Beavis and Butthead mistake it for the real thing...Beavis and Butthead are Dead: When Highland HIgh telephones to find out why the duo haven't been in class for three weeks, Beavis tells them that they're dead. While McVicker, Buzzcut and others celebrate, Van Dreson tries to get everyone to remember the good in Beavis and Butthead by reliving various memories of the duo. This was the original series finale.All in all, Volume 3 of the Mike Judge collection is a good deal. As with the first two volumes, much of te material that was cut from some of the episodes can be viewed as easter eggs. And Disk three contains a selection of videos and some other bonus materials.",4,I only wish there were more.,1303084800,"04 18, 2011",2011,3941,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'Beavis', 'Butthead', 'was', 'thirteen', 'so', 'am', 'complete', 'total', 'agreement', 'fact', 'Mike', 'Judge', 'like', 'uh', 'get', 'up', 'off', 'butt', 'release', 'whole', 'show', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Mike', 'Judge', 'collections', 'are', 'travesties', 'most', 'reviewers', 'here', 'seem', 'feel', 'are', 'recently', 'ordered', 'three', 'Amazon', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'received', 'volume', '2', 'have', '1', '3', 'must', 'say', 'have', ""n't"", 'laughed', 'so', 'much', 'so', 'hard', 'long', 'time', 'exception', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'episode', 'collections', 'so', 'far', 'Only', 'couple', 'favorites', 'were', 'omitted', 'being', 'Beard', 'BOys', 'Hard', 'Sell', 'videos', 'did', 'have', 'few', 'favorites', 'was', 'more', 'interested', 'cartoons', 'absence', 'few', 'videos', 'collections', ""n't"", 'much', 'blow', 'only', 'video', 'was', 'disappointed', 'not', 'find', 'collection', 'was', 'Nightmares', 'Violent', 'Femmes', 'mainly', 'how', 'Beavis', 'freaked', 'time', 'heard', 'word', 'Suck.Volume', 'three', 'packed', 'full', 'many', 'favorites', ""'ll"", 'list', 'just', 'few', 'here.Vaya', 'Con', 'Cornholio', 'Beavis', 'alter', 'ego', 'resurfaces', 'entire', 'supply', 'Burger', 'World', 'new', 'soda', 'Unfortunately', 'idiotic', 'agent', 'INS', 'drop', 'episode', 'Beavis', 'accidentally', 'deported', 'Mexico', 'agent', 'superiors', 'try', 'make', 'sense', 'gibberish', 'Cornholio.Just', 'Girls', 'THe', 'duo', 'watch', 'sex', 'ed', 'film', 'aimed', 'young', 'girls', 'discover', 'subject', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'fascinating', ""'d"", 'thought.Follow', 'Beavis', 'mimicks', 'everything', 'Butthead', 'predictable', 'results.Huh-huh-humbug', 'parody', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'A', 'CHristmas', 'Carrol', 'Beavis', 'tyranical', 'manager', 'Burger', 'World', 'Principal', 'McVicker', 'role', 'unfortunate', 'Bob', 'Cratchet', 'leaving', 'disgruntled', 'McVicker', 'Butthead', 'care', 'Beavis', 'home', 'visited', 'first', 'ghostly', 'Butthead', 'then', 'three', 'spirits', 'Tom', 'Anderson', 'Christmas', 'Past', 'Mr.', 'Van', 'Dreson', 'CHristmas', 'Present', 'Mr.', 'Buzzcut', 'CHristmas', 'Future.It', 'Miserable', 'Life', 'response', 'prayers', 'people', 'HIghland', 'God', 'Charlie', 'boys', 'guardian', 'angel', 'kill', 'When', 'attempt', 'persuade', 'Butthead', 'off', 'showing', 'what', 'Highland', 'would', 'be', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'born.Substitute', 'Mr.', 'Van', 'Dreson', 'accidentally', 'attempting', 'demonstrate', 'Yoga', 'position', 'class', 'substitute', 'who', 'everyone', 'save', 'titular', 'duo.Sprout', 'Mr.', 'Van', 'Dreson', 'class', 'project', 'grow', 'own', 'food', 'boys', 'attempt', 'grow', 'corn', 'make', 'own', 'nachos', 'less', 'satisfactory', 'results.Buy', 'Beer', 'guest', 'lecture', 'school', 'dangers', 'alcohol', 'addiction', 'duo', 'predictably', 'get', 'wrong', 'idea', 'attempt', 'get', 'booz', 'attending', 'AA', 'meeting', 'disastrous', 'results', 'fellow', 'attendees.Bride', 'Butt', 'Head', 'further', 'attempt', 'score', 'Butthead', 'mail', 'order', 'Russian', 'bride', 'Unfortunately', 'less', 'pleased', 'arrangement', 'Graduation', 'Concerned', 'students', 'lack', 'self-esteem', 'Van', 'Dreson', 'mock', 'graduation', 'ceremony', 'prepare', 'big', 'event', 'Unfortunately', 'Beavis', 'Butthead', 'mistake', 'real', 'thing', 'Beavis', 'Butthead', 'are', 'Dead', 'When', 'Highland', 'HIgh', 'telephones', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'duo', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'class', 'three', 'weeks', 'Beavis', ""'re"", 'dead', 'McVicker', 'Buzzcut', 'others', 'celebrate', 'Van', 'Dreson', 'get', 'everyone', 'remember', 'good', 'Beavis', 'Butthead', 'reliving', 'various', 'memories', 'duo', 'was', 'original', 'series', 'finale.All', 'Volume', '3', 'Mike', 'Judge', 'collection', 'good', 'deal', 'first', 'two', 'volumes', 'much', 'te', 'material', 'was', 'cut', 'episodes', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'easter', 'eggs', 'Disk', 'three', 'selection', 'videos', 'other', 'bonus', 'materials']","Beavis and Butt-head - The Mike Judge Collection, Vol. 3"

The reason is because the people want those too. I know that you are embarressed to release them but remember this, at least they looked better than The Simpsons when they debuted on the Tracy Ullman Show (no offense to the creators of The Simpsons). Beavis and Butthead haven't looked that much different from the early seasons to the later ones. Well, except for Mr. Anderson, he was the only one who changed dramatically, but it still doesn't mean that you have to keep the unreleased episodes from seeing the light of day.
