It also has one of the most fascinating back-stories in movie history, with a tumultuous production and distribution history that rivals &quot;Titanic&quot; and &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;.It's too bad that &quot;The Sinister Saga of Making 'The Stunt Man'&quot; is one of the most agonizingly cheesy documentaries I've ever seen.  It resembles a childrens' science television show, with an overuse of  annoying and disgustingly &quot;cute&quot; visual gimmicks. It looks like the work of a recent graduate of a community college videography class, with too much time and equipment on their hands. Sadly, the documentary was directed by Rush himself.So is this documentary worth seeing? Absolutely, if only because the back-story is so compelling. However, Rush could have saved a lot of time and money merely filming himself delivering the same information as a straight lecture. The approach used here is nearly unbearable.",3,"Informative, but sadly cheesy and annoying",1010534400,"01 9, 2002",2002,1039,"['Richard', 'Rush', 'quot', 'Stunt', 'Man', 'quot', 'one', 'most', 'original', 'intelligent', 'exhilarating', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'also', 'one', 'most', 'fascinating', 'back-stories', 'movie', 'history', 'tumultuous', 'production', 'distribution', 'history', 'quot', 'Titanic', 'quot', 'quot', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'quot', '.It', 'too', 'bad', 'quot', 'Sinister', 'Saga', 'Making', ""'The"", 'Stunt', 'Man', 'quot', 'one', 'most', 'agonizingly', 'cheesy', 'documentaries', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'childrens', 'science', 'television', 'show', 'overuse', 'annoying', 'disgustingly', 'quot', 'cute', 'quot', 'visual', 'gimmicks', 'work', 'recent', 'graduate', 'community', 'college', 'videography', 'class', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'equipment', 'hands', 'Sadly', 'documentary', 'was', 'directed', 'Rush', 'himself.So', 'documentary', 'worth', 'seeing', 'Absolutely', 'only', 'back-story', 'so', 'compelling', 'However', 'Rush', 'could', 'have', 'saved', 'lot', 'time', 'money', 'merely', 'filming', 'delivering', 'same', 'information', 'straight', 'lecture', 'approach', 'used', 'here', 'nearly', 'unbearable']","The Sinister Saga of Making ""The Stunt Man"""

And by the end, it's more thought provoking than anything else. Although as beautifully filmed as anything that came out of the old Hollywood studio system, it deals with themes of right & wrong and shifting reality, that tend to, as it thrills us with the action & explosions, make us damned uncomfortable. That said, I loved this documentary! Richard Rush was having a good time, and let us at least a third the way into his head. It was great imagining him one afternoon having a young Steve Railsback into his house for an impromptu audition. All the actors when speaking of the experience of filming the movie became as wide-eyed & excited as children. You get a sense of what a great time this was for them. If you want to relive the thrill of first seeing The Stunt Man, this funny, loving documentary will give that to you. It's absolutely icing on the frigging cake.",5,"Making a dazzling, unpredictable & brilliant film sucks",1297468800,"02 12, 2011",2011,974,"['lot', 'people', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'Stunt', 'Man', 'turns', 'exciting', 'heart-warming', 'obscene', 'end', 'more', 'thought', 'provoking', 'anything', 'else', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'anything', 'came', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'studio', 'system', 'themes', 'right', 'wrong', 'shifting', 'reality', 'tend', 'action', 'explosions', 'make', 'damned', 'uncomfortable', 'said', 'loved', 'documentary', 'Richard', 'Rush', 'was', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'let', 'least', 'third', 'way', 'head', 'was', 'great', 'imagining', 'one', 'afternoon', 'having', 'young', 'Steve', 'Railsback', 'house', 'impromptu', 'audition', 'actors', 'when', 'speaking', 'experience', 'filming', 'movie', 'became', 'wide-eyed', 'excited', 'children', 'get', 'sense', 'what', 'great', 'time', 'was', 'want', 'relive', 'thrill', 'first', 'seeing', 'Stunt', 'Man', 'funny', 'loving', 'documentary', 'will', 'give', 'absolutely', 'icing', 'frigging', 'cake']","The Sinister Saga of Making ""The Stunt Man"""
672366,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00005OCK8,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[13, 13]","Obviously, most viewers seriously looking at this documentary probably already have an affection for the film ""The Stunt Man,""--an audacious film, made by Richard Rush.  The process of getting ""The Stunt Man"" to the screen was one that took almost a decade.  Never losing sight of his vision for the film, he was unwilling to compromise his intent.  His story is an inspiration--equal parts horrifying, hysterical, and educational.  This sparse documentary is, in essence, an interview with Rush.  Staged almost like a cheesy industrial film, time is spent just watching Rush speak to the camera--almost like a lecture one might catch at a local film university.  But Rush is so engaging and likable, and his courage and fortitude should be an example to modern filmmakers the world over.  It's great to see him embrace the success of ""The Stunt Man,"" albeit 25 years after it was released.There are just some movies in your life that really speak to you--that connect to you on some emotional or intellectual level in a very special way.  ""The Stunt Man"" is such a film for me.  Released in 1980, this ode to movie making is a challenging, intelligent, incisive and fun film that very few people saw upon its initial release.  After a 10 year preproduction struggle by Rush, a tumultuous shoot, and no support from a studio that didn't care about the film--it was essentially dumped with no fanfare.  But with amazing clarity and foresight, the film was surprisingly awarded with three major Academy Award nomination--Best Actor for Peter O'Toole, Best Director for Rush, and Best Screenplay for Rush and Lawrence Marcus.  In the years that have followed, the film has attained a cult status and a legion of faithful fans (myself among them).  In fact, I have seen this film probably 15 times and it was the first (really!) VHS tape I ever bought--now that's dating me!So if you love ""The Stunt Man,"" I propose that you will also find this documentary a fascinating contribution--and a real bite of movie history.  This documentary is also included in the Limited Edition ""The Stunt Man,"" likewise offered by Anchor Bay.  I'd certainly recommend this option as opposed to buying the film and documentary separately (if it is still available).  Treat yourself to a great film and a terrific documentary.

Bens, Jr.","[2, 5]","What could have been a fascinating documentary about the making of a brilliant film is sabotaged by amateurish camera work, not-so-special ""effects"" and a script delivered by a director who comes off (though not necessarily is) fascinated more with himself than the film.  It is cheesy and unending and makes any information about the film secondary to the ""artistic"" effect they were going for.  If you took out all the needless narration, there is probably about ten minutes of interesting info about the film, but you have to wade through so much muck to get to it, it becomes frustrating.  The Stunt Man was a brilliant, layered film.  This documentary (or is it a mocumentary) is trying so hard to be as edgy and multidimensional as the film that it ultimately comes off as bloated, amateurish and uninteresting.  In short, this film is nothing like The Stunt Man and any good will carried over by that brilliant picture is burned away by an overabundance of pretentiousness.",1,Interminable,1241308800,"05 3, 2009",2009,980,"['What', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'fascinating', 'documentary', 'making', 'brilliant', 'film', 'sabotaged', 'amateurish', 'camera', 'work', 'not-so-special', 'effects', 'script', 'delivered', 'director', 'who', 'off', 'not', 'necessarily', 'fascinated', 'more', 'film', 'cheesy', 'unending', 'information', 'film', 'secondary', 'artistic', 'effect', 'were', 'going', 'took', 'out', 'needless', 'narration', 'probably', 'about', 'ten', 'minutes', 'interesting', 'info', 'film', 'have', 'wade', 'so', 'much', 'muck', 'get', 'frustrating', 'Stunt', 'Man', 'was', 'brilliant', 'layered', 'film', 'documentary', 'mocumentary', 'trying', 'so', 'hard', 'be', 'edgy', 'multidimensional', 'film', 'ultimately', 'off', 'bloated', 'amateurish', 'uninteresting', 'short', 'film', 'nothing', 'Stunt', 'Man', 'good', 'will', 'carried', 'brilliant', 'picture', 'burned', 'away', 'overabundance', 'pretentiousness']","The Sinister Saga of Making ""The Stunt Man"""
