As usual, six episodes are never enough - but then again, we don't want them to water it down just to have more episodes. I just hope there will be more Little Britain one way or another!Almost all of the UK characters had a great ""translation"" to the HBO version, except for perhaps Sebastian who, in my opinion, did not quite click as Prime Minister. Most of the new US characters were funny, including the living-in-the-past astronaut, the hunters, and the Southern grand-ma. The Starbucks-within-a-Starbucks was very poignant.Being on HBO was great for Little Britain USA as it allowed Matt and David to push the comedy envelope without fear of interference from jumpy executives on cable and network TV.For new viewers, I recommend starting from the first UK season and watching them in sequence, so you can get a better feel of the characters.DVD Extras==========1.

After all, there's tons of culture here in the USA to parody & mock.If you've seen the original series, then you know that the original series is comprised of several shorts, all of which frequently had reoccurring characters. Many of these characters make appearances in this show, some of which work & some of which do not.The good part of this set is that it is funny. Some of the skits are fantastic, with my personal favorite being the ones with the dog owner. Others just aren't or are really only funny the first few times. The Ellie Grace skit was funny the first few times, but it was so incredibly repetitive that after a while it just wasn't all that funny.The part that sort of disappointed me the most is that so much of it wasn't really even original to the USA series. Don't get me wrong- I love Little Britain & they bring over some of my favorite characters (Lou & Andy, Carol Beer). It's just that these seemed to be the majority of the series. These weren't bad strips for the most part, just not anything I couldn't see in the regular series. The only set that really wasn't all that funny was the Sebastian Love skit set. He's the Prime Minister in this series & it just doesn't work as well as it did when he was the assistant to the PM.Overall, this is a decent set & it would make for a nice addition to the collection of any Little Britain fan. If you haven't seen the original series though, I recommend that you start with the inspiration for it all.

And you'll quickly discover the best sketch comedy isn't being shown on ""Saturday Night Live"" or ""Mad TV"" but rather comes at you like a zombie attack (gross and unrelenting) from Britain.I mean that as a complement.I encourage you to watch the original series,Little Britain: The Complete Collection, which is funnier than this American version in much the same wayThe Office - The Complete Collectioncompares with the NBC version,The Office.Little Britain USA, however, introduces several new characters, most notably Bing Gordyn, the eighth man on the moon, and gym buddies Mark and Tom. Bing yearns for recognition but no one appreciates the aging astronaut. The sketches chronicle his attempts to find the spotlight. Meanwhile, Mark and Tom's locker room sketches revolve around their body image with their bodies on full display (anatomically correct body suits that will make you cringe).Lucas and Walliams share a demented kinship with other grotesque comedies, includingThe League of GentlemenandTrailer Park Boysas well as feature filmsBoratandTropic Thunder.In my Amazon review of Tropic Thunder I wrote, ""You'll laugh but this movie isn't for the easily offended.
