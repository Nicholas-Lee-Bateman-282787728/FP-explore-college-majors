She wore out two or three copies of this video and then once our second child came along, I could no longer find it.  Thankfully it came out on dvd in time for baby number three because this is the very best Sesame Street dvd we own.  It is soothing and cozy and the stories and songs are classically wonderful.  Our favorite is ""If Moon Were Cookie"" but the whole thing is just great.  I love the story about the sun and moon.  The dvd is hosted by Big Bird and he is trying to show the viewer ways to fall asleep if they are  having trouble sleeping.  We still watch this dvd all the time, and the oldest child, the one whose favorite it was ten years ago, still sneaks in now and gets it and sometimes watches it before bedtime, using her sister as an excuse.  We love this.  It is highly recommended.",5,Our favorite Sesame Street dvd,1164672000,"11 28, 2006",2006,910,"['first', 'owned', 'video', 'back', '1996', 'when', 'first', 'child', 'was', 'just', 'starting', 'watch', 'videos', 'wore', 'out', 'two', 'three', 'copies', 'video', 'then', 'once', 'second', 'child', 'came', 'along', 'could', 'no', 'longer', 'find', 'Thankfully', 'came', 'out', 'dvd', 'time', 'baby', 'number', 'three', 'very', 'best', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'own', 'soothing', 'cozy', 'stories', 'songs', 'are', 'classically', 'wonderful', 'favorite', 'Moon', 'Were', 'Cookie', 'whole', 'thing', 'just', 'great', 'love', 'story', 'sun', 'moon', 'dvd', 'hosted', 'Big', 'Bird', 'trying', 'show', 'viewer', 'ways', 'fall', 'asleep', 'are', 'having', 'trouble', 'sleeping', 'still', 'watch', 'dvd', 'time', 'oldest', 'child', 'one', 'favorite', 'was', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'still', 'now', 'sometimes', 'watches', 'bedtime', 'using', 'sister', 'excuse', 'love', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A

899872,A3S3R88HA0HZG3,B000929V2C,PT Cruiser,"[1, 1]","I bought this DVD for our two parrots about a year ago.  (They LOVE watching kid's movies!)  I can tell it is one of their favorites because they become very animated when we play it.  There are several really cute Sesame Street songs on this DVD, but one of our favorites is, ""I Dance Myself to Sleep"".  When this song starts both birds get on the closest perch to the TV set and dance back and forth from foot to foot.  One of them flaps her wings.  I can't resist singing along when I hear it and dancing along with them.  One of the endearing segments of the DVD is a scene with Big Bird where he tells how to snuggle in to go to sleep.  He talks about getting nice and comfy and putting your head under your wing and then stops and says, ""Well, maybe we're all not birds...""  This just makes me grin from ear to ear!One nice thing about this DVD is that it has the auto play feature which means it will start over on it's own when it's finished.  That's always a big plus, not to have to go in and restart it each time.Children without wings and feathers would likely be even more delighted than the birds with this sweet DVD. The Sesame Street characters are cute and the songs are entertaining.  There is lots of music and color all the way through. It's a little bit lively in some parts but not so much so that I think it would keep children awake.  Heck, I don't mind watching it and find myself humming the songs at different times.  If we ever wear it out, it's one that would be replaced right away.",5,This DVD gets played almost every evening,1224806400,"10 24, 2008",2008,1512,"['bought', 'DVD', 'two', 'parrots', 'year', 'ago', 'LOVE', 'watching', 'kid', 'movies', 'can', 'tell', 'one', 'favorites', 'become', 'very', 'animated', 'when', 'play', 'are', 'several', 'really', 'cute', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'songs', 'DVD', 'one', 'favorites', 'Dance', 'Sleep', 'When', 'song', 'birds', 'get', 'closest', 'perch', 'TV', 'set', 'dance', 'back', 'forth', 'foot', 'foot', 'One', 'wings', 'ca', ""n't"", 'resist', 'singing', 'when', 'hear', 'dancing', 'along', 'One', 'endearing', 'segments', 'DVD', 'scene', 'Big', 'Bird', 'where', 'how', 'snuggle', 'go', 'sleep', 'getting', 'nice', 'comfy', 'putting', 'head', 'wing', 'then', 'stops', 'Well', 'maybe', ""'re"", 'not', 'birds', 'just', 'grin', 'ear', 'ear', 'One', 'nice', 'thing', 'DVD', 'auto', 'play', 'feature', 'will', 'start', 'own', 'when', 'finished', 'always', 'big', 'plus', 'not', 'have', 'go', 'restart', 'time.Children', 'wings', 'feathers', 'would', 'likely', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'delighted', 'birds', 'sweet', 'DVD', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'characters', 'are', 'cute', 'songs', 'are', 'entertaining', 'lots', 'music', 'color', 'way', 'little', 'bit', 'lively', 'parts', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'think', 'would', 'keep', 'children', 'awake', 'Heck', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'watching', 'find', 'humming', 'songs', 'different', 'times', 'ever', 'wear', 'out', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'replaced', 'right', 'away']",N/A
