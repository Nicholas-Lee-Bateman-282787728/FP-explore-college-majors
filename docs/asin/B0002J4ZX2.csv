The original series had known stars, or up-and-coming ones.  The 80's series did the same.  Why shouldn't UPN have used stars to get people to tune in?  And while we're at it, Forest Whittaker does a fine job as host.  I always felt his performance was sort of a tribute to Serling.  He has a great voice, and that's about all I require from a narrator.Most of the episodes are worthy of the Serling name as well.  They're well-written, well-produced, and (usually) well-acted.  Jason Alexander gives the performance of his career in ""One Night At Mercy.""  Much attention has been given to the remake/sequel episodes, but personally they just reminded me of how great the originals were.Look, there will never be another Rod Serling.  And there's not likely to be another show as fresh and original as the Zone was in its original form.

It's very easy to see why it was cancelled after one season. First off, who in the world chose Forest Whitaker as the host? Sometimes he's calm and cool, others he seems almost hyper in his delivery of the taglines. No one could compare to Serling in delivery, but they could have found SOMEONE a little more ""out there"" for host. Second, the stories...wow. Most of them have a good premise, but they all seem to just limp away rather than hit you with the shocking impact the original series had. ""Still a Good Life"" is a perfect example. Based as a sequel to an original TZ episode (with two of the original actors still in the main roles), it had the potential to be the best show ever. The little girl (Billy Mumy's real daughter) acted one way throughout the entire episode, then at the end suddenly did a complete about-face that made absolutely no sense whatsoever. It was as if the writer just said, ""Hey, that'd be cool"" and jerked the story completely around. Unfortunately, this is not the only story like this in the series. Most have very uneven storylines, trying to make us care for one-dimensional characters. While the original (and even 80's version) TZ had us sympathetic for the characters involved (or at least hating the baddies), this one is more like watching a car wreck from the outside. There's some morbid curiousity, but you can walk away and not really care how it all turns out. There are some gems here (""The Pool Guy"" and ""Chosen"" to name a couple), but most are just crash-and-burners.All in all, I'm looking forward to seeing the 80's version come out later this year. UPN made a good try on this revival with some major talent, but even the best actor can only do so much with inferior stories.

Actually, these modern twilight zone episodes, which unfortunately; only televised for one season. Should've went on throughout other seasons! As I read some of these reviews: They make Forest Whitaker out to be the bad guy. They judge him on stuff like: Him walking while explaining the phenomena of what was going on, Or he didn't tell them the same way as it was told in days of the original Etc;But the truth of the matter is: No, Forest isn't Rod or vice versa. Because they're 2 totally different people without having the same personalities,voices,Etc; But none of these aspects make Forest any less of a host.He already knew the judgements would be made from people comparing his style to the one of the old. But any of you reviewers would feel the same level of pressure if you was trying to host a new series from the old. I guarantee you that their'll be ""some"" people in this generation, who'll like the modernized first season version of the twilight zone. That he did, in some/many ways, over the original! Why is simple: Because thoughts change- (In order to go along with the current times that a generation of people live in!)An example- The old movie ""Scarface"" Though it already is or It soon will be a collector's item in the future. However, their will be other later versions of that same movie each generation. Then the viewers of that era will become the positive reviewers of the newer versions and yet critics of the older ones. Because again, it goes back to what was wrote in parenthesis above! Sometime in the future,their will come a time, where; The modern version that Forest was a host of: It'll also become a collector's item for the current generation twilight zone movie buff. Sure, u might read this and laugh now! ""But mock my word"" As the saying goes,""Theirs nothing new under the sun"" Its just that more flavor gets added each time around!A thousand years from now- If, televisions exist, their will be someone who'll come along and revive those twilight zone episodes that later become the old! And so on! And in that time period of the future- They'll laugh at any previous versions of it,including the original ones that started in black & white.So the bottom line is this: Lets appreciate the hard work that Forest put into this: Because of his own love for the original twilight zone episodes! He deserves an applause for his bravery,creativity,dedication and love that he has for the twilight zone stuff. If you would've been in his shoes- Perhaps, you would've been to fearful, to try and host, or re-tell, episodes that were told in color! I highly liked the latest series! In fact, in many ways, I prefer some of the latest over the episodes of the old! Why,is because the new always builds on the old. And some things get better as time goes on though other things get worse! But what gets labelled as being ""better or worse"" All depends on the reviewers point of view!Regardless of the ratings: I personally think these series were excellent!

836938,AW5BZD37T2G3N,B0002J4ZX2,Just Another Opinion,"[5, 7]","This series represents the second attempt to revive TZ, and is vastly inferior to its predecessor.  The series began with some built-in problems, particularly the choice of Forest Whitaker as host-narrator.  Mr. Whitaker is a fine actor, but a poor  choice to host the series, and he appears quite uncomfortable when introducing episodes, often walking around while delivering his opening lines.  After watching some of these episodes, one can understand Forest's discomfort; he probably regretted accepting the job.  Another major problem is that this series came out on UPN, which has never been (and never will be) a leader in quality programming.  Although there are some interesting story ideas, they usually fall flat in the end.  ""It's Still A Good Life"" is a noteworthy example.  Intended as a sequel to one of the best episodes of the original series, and featuring original cast members Cloris Leachman and Bill Mumy (with the addition of Mumy's daughter, Liliana), this episode gets off to a good start, but the plot abruptly takes a silly turn, leading to a rushed, nonsensical, and unsatisfying conclusion.  This sort of hackneyed plotting occurs throughout the series.  Talented actors simply cannot compensate for lousy writing.  This series resembles the original in name only, and even the worst of the mid-80's episodes is superior to this conglomeration of silly, poorly-written, lame stories.  The kindest thing that can be said for this set is that it is reasonably priced and nicely packaged.

(Which of course made me very happy! He's the perfect age for getting into this sort of programme.) So, we ended up watching a number of episodes from all three versions---the original series from 1959, as well as the 1985 and 2002 remakes.This particular post concerns the most recent incarnation of the series. This version has gotten some scathing reviews, which I don't think are entirely warranted. Oh, it's true enough that Forest Whittaker is totally miscast as the host. And let's face it, some of these episodes are horrible---bad scripts featuring poor actors. But there are some very good stories included among the 43 episodes as well. I suppose my main complaint is that this doesn't really feel like ""The Twilight Zone""; Rod Serling's original series had a very distinctive identity, its own unique personality, which is very difficult (if not impossible) to recapture. But if the viewer goes into this programme thinking of it, in general, as a supernaturally-themed anthology, rather than as a remake of an iconic series, there is much to enjoy.Presentation is very nice, with a 5.1 surround soundtrack and 1.78:1 aspect ratio which looks great on a widescreen television. The boxed set is long out of print, but as of this writing can be found selling on Amazon for between ten and twenty USD, which is very reasonable for 960 minutes spread out over six discs.

In the 80's version you only had a narrator and this series would have done well to follow suit-no one can take Rod Serling's place. As for the episodes themselves, some are pretty good and others so-so. Being a fan I still bought the set knowing all of the aforementioned from watching some of the shows when they first aired.

Perhaps because the original show from the 50's was already remade in the 80's only those that were fans of the original series gave this one a look.Having read quite a few reviews of this series it seems it wasn't too popular with fans of the original and most people seem to think the 80's remake was better. However, I prefer this remake so much that I bought the 6-disc Season 1 set. Unfortunately, there was only one season! Some of the things I liked best about this show was having the host Forest Whitaker walk around the set in the beginning and end of each episode. Gives it sort of a 3-dimensional feel I think. And come on you gotta love that introduction music - much better than the score for either of the previous series. And of course you get to see a lot of your favorite B-movie and TV show actors make a debut or two. I never watched the show when it aired in 2002. I actually stumbled across it one night on one of the local cable channels and saw the episode ""The Pool Guy"" with Lou Diamond Phillips. Since LDP is my favorite ""non-mainstream"" actor, I decide to watch it. The story was good and reminded me of the Outer Limit series I had enjoyed so much a few years ago. I later learned that the same person that produced The Outer Limits also did this Twilight Zone (2002) series. So if you were a fan of the Outer Limits I think it is safe to say you'd enjoy some of these episodes as well. Sure not every story is a good one, but some of them are quite good. Most of the stories take on familiar ground in the Sci-Fi realm, but there are a few twists here and there you aren't likely to expect. Episode 2 ""Night Route"" comes to mind. And I enjoyed Jason Alexander's (George from Seinfeld) portrayal of ""Death"" in ""One Night at Mercy."" The aforementioned ""The Pool Guy"" is one of the classic episodes in this series. The complete Season 1 can be had on Amazon (NEW) for about $10! Unheard of for a complete season series. The DVD set comes with an episode guide as well.

It works best if you try think of it as a separate series all on its own.  Yes, the famous Twilight Zone twist ending is definitely here, and the writing really isn't all that bad.  There are quite a few episodes that leave you thinking about the story lines long after you have watched them.  If, however, you are looking to be entertained by actors of the 1950s/1960s caliber, you won't find them here.  In this series there is no one comparable to the likes of Burgess Meredith, Lee Marvin, Agnes Moorehead, Jack Klugman, Gladys Cooper, Art Carney, Robert Redford or any number of other character actors from that period whom you used to see all the time on TV but never could put a name to.  Except for Cloris Leachman, Jeffrey Combs, Lou Diamond Phillips and Jason Alexander, if the guest stars of the 2002 Twilight Zone series are the most inspired performers of today (as is advertised on the box) TV  may in a whole lot of trouble!  I'm not sure if this is an indictment against the actors and actresses in movies and TV today, but there just doesn't seem to be anyone here that you can imagine folks talking about 30-40 years from now.  The actors and stories of the 50s/60s Twilight Zone are not only just talked about today, they are held up as the benchmark for everything that has followed.  Forest Whitaker, however, does a very nice job as the Serling-like narrator, although as mentioned by others here, he lacks the air of mystery that Mr. Serling projected.  Lastly, the music for this 2002 series really leaves much to be desired.  At times it will loudly overpower what is said or done by the narrator or the actor, and never does it seem set the proper atmosphere or mood.  The theme and background music sound as though they were meant to be jarring for the simple sake of being jarring.  I hate to make another comparison here, but the music of Bernard Herrmann, Nathan Van Cleave and Jerry Goldsmith did as much for the storylines of the original 50s/60s series as did the writers, directors and actors.  Those composers could literally send you through the ceiling by a striking a simple violin chord at a suspenseful moment!  It was great!  Again, even after all the negatives listed, I still can suggest you see this series -- just don't expect more than a nice bang for your buck.

Of course the later ones were far better produced, the stories were often a lot better. I could go on. But, for heaven's sake (pun intended?) what's Trek without Kirk, Spock, et al?????The same applies to The Outer Limits, and to this, the Twilight Zone.Aside from that, I don't agree so much with some other critics. Many of the stories were well put together. I just watched one tonight called ""Hunted"" about a future era. Rather than give away anything about the story, it included a couple of surprises, or was at least less predictable than I had anticipated.Another one, ""Another Life,"" with Wood Harris, from ""The Wire"" (one of the best series in the history of television!) was clever . Until the end, I didn't know how it would end, and it had a nice sort of moral.As other critics have noted, there were remakes, or sequels to the original Serling series. A classis Serling is ""Monsters are Due on Maple Street,"" something discussed in probably every undergraduate film course in history. This series updates that--puts it in the context of the early 21st century, and calls it ""The Monsters on Maple Street."" And the sequel of an early 60s episode with Billy Mumy (later, of course, on the ghastly TV series ""Lost in Space"") entitled ""It's Still a Good Life,"" yeah, the script left a little to be desired. But, like in films, the sequel is almost never as good as the original.Forest Whitaker? Well, aside from his Scientology, needless to even say he ain't Rod Serling. No one is, or ever will be Rod Serling.An interested contrast with the original: Many of those who starred in the 1960s, think Robert Duvall, William Shatner and countless others, went on to become stars of other series or films. This series, rather, promoted the episodes based on their stars. For instance, the first one I watched was ""The Executions of Grady Finch,"" because the star was Jeremy Sisto, ""Six Feet Under,"" it says after his name, another of among my favorite series. Nearly all the episodes are sold, in the set of DVDs anyway, on their stars ""resumes,"" i.e., other series of films from which you know them.That's nearly here nor there, just interesting.If your a diehard early Twilight Zone fan this will probably disappoint you.
