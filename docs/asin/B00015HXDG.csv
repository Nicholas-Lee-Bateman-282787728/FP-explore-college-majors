793772,A34ZH5K0EHL8P0,B00015HXDG,"Adam A. Fine ""Caretaker of the Arts""","[16, 16]","When I read a recent stock description that descibed the monarchy as ""heartless"" in relation to Prince John, I felt compelled to say that this is not an issue of ""heartless monarchy,"" as anyone familar with the time and subject undoubtedly knows. The Monarchy was acting in a way that simply underscored its core principles-- the young Prince's epilelpsy was a complete unknown in royal circles, and indeed, the most prudent advice (at the time) was taken. It is impled at several points in this film that historically cold-as-ice Queen Mary was confused and heartbroken over the separation and eventual loss of her son (though the same may not be said of the gruff and callous King George V).More importantly, the far deeper foundation of this magnificent BBC piece is the decline and fall of both the European aristocracy and the British Empire as the new world order of the 20th Century began to form, sparked by WWI. Through the eyes of Pronce John a deeper shift is grasped-- and while he may not know it, we certainly do.There is little evidence historically to suggest that the future Duke of Kent was so devoted to his young brother-- in fact, presumably due to schooling, The Prince of Wales, The Dukes of York and Gloucester and Princess Mary are all but absent. But for the sake of the plot, the young Duke of Kent adds an important human element-- as does governess Lalla, of whom little is known, but much is ascribed to here (and much liberty is taken with the enigmatic Lalla for the sake of the piece).Still, this is a very accurate, very important piece of work. More than anyone, Miranda Richardson seems to capture Queen Mary with more dignity and repressed emotion (her hallmarks) than any actors I have seen.In short, this is not a piece about ""cruel royalty,"" as the marketing would have you believe, with its very 21st century, post-Diana terms (the monarchy has always been heartless, it seems to imply). Far from it. This is a period piece marking a crucial time for the European aristocracy, and the allegory of John's death is really the death of the ""Old World,"" as defined by late Victorian and Edwardian England.Truly a magnificent piece of work, though some basic knowledge of early Windsor history would add to the overall understanding and enjoyment of the piece.",5,"Excellent allegory of final days of ""Old"" aristocratic world",1120348800,"07 3, 2005",2005,2296,"['When', 'read', 'recent', 'stock', 'description', 'descibed', 'monarchy', 'heartless', 'relation', 'Prince', 'John', 'felt', 'compelled', 'say', 'not', 'issue', 'heartless', 'monarchy', 'anyone', 'familar', 'time', 'subject', 'undoubtedly', 'Monarchy', 'was', 'acting', 'way', 'simply', 'underscored', 'core', 'principles', 'young', 'Prince', 'epilelpsy', 'was', 'complete', 'unknown', 'royal', 'circles', 'indeed', 'most', 'prudent', 'advice', 'time', 'was', 'taken', 'impled', 'several', 'points', 'film', 'historically', 'cold-as-ice', 'Queen', 'Mary', 'was', 'confused', 'heartbroken', 'separation', 'eventual', 'loss', 'son', 'same', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'said', 'gruff', 'callous', 'King', 'George', 'V', '.More', 'importantly', 'far', 'deeper', 'foundation', 'magnificent', 'BBC', 'piece', 'decline', 'fall', 'European', 'aristocracy', 'British', 'Empire', 'new', 'world', 'order', '20th', 'Century', 'began', 'form', 'sparked', 'WWI', 'eyes', 'Pronce', 'John', 'deeper', 'shift', 'grasped', 'may', 'not', 'know', 'certainly', 'little', 'evidence', 'historically', 'suggest', 'future', 'Duke', 'Kent', 'was', 'so', 'devoted', 'young', 'brother', 'fact', 'presumably', 'due', 'schooling', 'Prince', 'Wales', 'Dukes', 'York', 'Gloucester', 'Princess', 'Mary', 'are', 'absent', 'sake', 'plot', 'young', 'Duke', 'Kent', 'important', 'human', 'element', 'governess', 'Lalla', 'whom', 'little', 'known', 'much', 'ascribed', 'here', 'much', 'liberty', 'taken', 'enigmatic', 'Lalla', 'sake', 'piece', '.Still', 'very', 'accurate', 'very', 'important', 'piece', 'work', 'More', 'anyone', 'Miranda', 'Richardson', 'capture', 'Queen', 'Mary', 'more', 'dignity', 'repressed', 'emotion', 'hallmarks', 'actors', 'have', 'seen.In', 'short', 'not', 'piece', 'cruel', 'royalty', 'marketing', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'very', '21st', 'century', 'post-Diana', 'terms', 'monarchy', 'always', 'been', 'heartless', 'imply', 'Far', 'period', 'piece', 'marking', 'crucial', 'time', 'European', 'aristocracy', 'allegory', 'John', 'death', 'really', 'death', 'Old', 'World', 'defined', 'late', 'Victorian', 'Edwardian', 'England.Truly', 'magnificent', 'piece', 'work', 'basic', 'knowledge', 'early', 'Windsor', 'history', 'would', 'add', 'overall', 'understanding', 'enjoyment', 'piece']",N/A
793773,ANGH6401L9Y0T,B00015HXDG,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[1, 1]","This is the story of Prince John of England, who had epilepsy and was kept out of the public eye to the extent possible. The story opens when John is 4, and Grandpapa (Edward VII) is staging butter pat races down his long black boots while the children each choose one to be their ""horse"" in the race. John decides they are all his.John had his first seizure at about that time, and to avoid his being too conspicuous, he is taken to Sandringham House, and eventually to an isolated farm on the estate where he lived with his nurse/nanny called Lalla. Doctors had said he was brain damaged and incapable of learning, and his tutor grew terribly frustrated with him, but eventually Lalla taught him quite a lot. But once his father became King George V, and especially once the war in Europe tied the royal family up in knots (remember that they were cousins to quite a few of the other European royals, not to mention Tzar Nicholas II), he rarely saw either his father or Queen Mary, his mother. His older brother George did visit, however, and they were pretty close.The one thing that bothered me about the movie, which was well done generally, was that George was at least a couple of years older than John, but when they switched actors to the older versions of them, George is shorter and slighter than John. Perhaps that was true, but if so, some mention of the reality would have helped me remember that George was older than John.All in all, a well-made movie about a not all that interesting a character.

793781,A2FS38D943KX12,B00015HXDG,chefdevergue,"[21, 21]","We have seen plenty of treatments of the Edwardian era and World War I, including a number from a child's perspective, but none with the perspective that one will find here.  Prince John (1905-1919), sheltered from public view due to a variety of ailments (including epilepsy & possibly a form of autism), drifts through his brief life unaffected and undisturbed by the tumult surrounding him.One reviewer scored this production for its sloppy editing, as the scenes appear to be jumbled together.  There is something to that criticism.  If you do not know the period well, you may be confused as to what year it is, not to mention who all of the royal relatives may be.  Every now and then, one gets a point of reference (death of Edward VII, assassination of Franz Ferdinand) that will tell you what year it is, but then you find that the scene has abruptly shifted to 2 years later.  This was a little disconcerting & may be the result of sloppy editing, but I am inclined to think that this was by design.  For a child cut off from world events, where every day consists of the same routine, the years might very well blur together after awhile.Aside from Prince John, a great deal of the action centered around his older brother, (the future Duke of Kent) Prince George (1902-1942), whose perspective is considerably different than that of his brother.  Condemned to be the only smart one in a family of relative dullards, Prince George feels most keenly the inability of his parents to deal effectively with much of anything at all, whether it is John's situation or matters of state.  At the film's conclusion, he almost envies his brother for being able to live his life on his own terms, and not give a damn what anyone else thinks.The performances are first rate.  Miranda Richardson is superb as Queen Mary, who clearly is torn between her duties as Queen and her wishes to be more attentive and supportive of her family.  Tom Hollander evokes sympathy as the hapless George V, who is all too aware of his limitations as a monarch and father & is considerably frustrated by it.  Shining through above all others is Gina McKee, who many may recall from ""The Forsyte Saga"" (in a role that I personally felt had her horribly miscast).  She may not have worked well as Irene Forsyte, but she was most moving as the wholy devoted nanny Lalla, who so cares about John's well-being that she is willing to endure a near-decade of virtual exile.  It appears that Lalla is unwilling to admit fully to herself the true nature of John's disabilities, continuing to insist that John is ""doing so much better.""  Her own world ultimately becomes more removed from reality than that of John himself.This is the ultimate irony of John's life, and we see it throughout the film.  He was shielded from public view to protect the royal family from potential embarrassment, but this same seclusion ultimately serves to protect John from his own family & their inadequecies.  Though largely forgotten by history, nonetheless he is the one who emerges most unscathed and uncompromised.",4,A unique perspective of the last days of Empire,1098662400,"10 25, 2004",2004,3073,"['have', 'seen', 'plenty', 'treatments', 'Edwardian', 'era', 'World', 'War', 'including', 'number', 'child', 'perspective', 'none', 'perspective', 'one', 'will', 'find', 'here', 'Prince', 'John', '1905-1919', 'sheltered', 'public', 'view', 'due', 'variety', 'ailments', 'including', 'epilepsy', 'possibly', 'form', 'autism', 'brief', 'life', 'unaffected', 'undisturbed', 'tumult', 'surrounding', 'him.One', 'reviewer', 'scored', 'production', 'sloppy', 'editing', 'scenes', 'appear', 'be', 'jumbled', 'together', 'something', 'criticism', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'period', 'well', 'may', 'be', 'confused', 'what', 'year', 'not', 'mention', 'who', 'royal', 'relatives', 'may', 'be', 'now', 'then', 'one', 'point', 'reference', 'death', 'Edward', 'VII', 'assassination', 'Franz', 'Ferdinand', 'will', 'tell', 'what', 'year', 'then', 'find', 'scene', 'abruptly', 'shifted', '2', 'years', 'later', 'was', 'little', 'disconcerting', 'may', 'be', 'result', 'sloppy', 'editing', 'am', 'inclined', 'think', 'was', 'design', 'child', 'cut', 'world', 'events', 'where', 'day', 'same', 'routine', 'years', 'might', 'very', 'well', 'blur', 'together', 'awhile.Aside', 'Prince', 'John', 'great', 'deal', 'action', 'centered', 'older', 'brother', 'future', 'Duke', 'Kent', 'Prince', 'George', '1902-1942', 'perspective', 'considerably', 'different', 'brother', 'Condemned', 'be', 'only', 'smart', 'one', 'family', 'relative', 'dullards', 'Prince', 'George', 'most', 'keenly', 'inability', 'parents', 'deal', 'effectively', 'much', 'anything', 'John', 'situation', 'matters', 'state', 'film', 'conclusion', 'almost', 'brother', 'being', 'able', 'live', 'life', 'own', 'terms', 'not', 'give', 'damn', 'what', 'anyone', 'else', 'thinks.The', 'performances', 'are', 'first', 'rate', 'Miranda', 'Richardson', 'superb', 'Queen', 'Mary', 'who', 'clearly', 'torn', 'duties', 'Queen', 'wishes', 'be', 'more', 'attentive', 'supportive', 'family', 'Tom', 'Hollander', 'sympathy', 'hapless', 'George', 'V', 'who', 'too', 'aware', 'limitations', 'monarch', 'father', 'considerably', 'frustrated', 'Shining', 'others', 'Gina', 'McKee', 'who', 'many', 'may', 'recall', 'Forsyte', 'Saga', 'role', 'personally', 'felt', 'had', 'horribly', 'miscast', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'worked', 'well', 'Irene', 'Forsyte', 'was', 'most', 'moving', 'wholy', 'devoted', 'nanny', 'Lalla', 'who', 'so', 'John', 'well-being', 'willing', 'endure', 'near-decade', 'virtual', 'exile', 'Lalla', 'unwilling', 'admit', 'fully', 'herself', 'true', 'nature', 'John', 'disabilities', 'continuing', 'insist', 'John', 'doing', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'own', 'world', 'ultimately', 'more', 'removed', 'reality', 'John', 'himself.This', 'ultimate', 'irony', 'John', 'life', 'see', 'film', 'was', 'shielded', 'public', 'view', 'protect', 'royal', 'family', 'potential', 'embarrassment', 'same', 'seclusion', 'ultimately', 'protect', 'John', 'own', 'family', 'inadequecies', 'Though', 'largely', 'forgotten', 'history', 'nonetheless', 'one', 'who', 'most', 'unscathed', 'uncompromised']",N/A

THE LOST PRINCE is one of the finest films I've ever enjoyed, even if it sags a bit and focuses too much on silly world events (the Czar swimming while St. Petersburg burned?...c'mon!!)This film alleges to tell the story of Prince John. John was an uncle to the present Queen Elizabeth; her father was George VI (new film coming soon about him). His father was George V, the grandfather being Edward VII. John was George VI's older brother, thus uncle to the Queen. [Many thanks to Mercy Wright for the correction of my original error in the ascendancy!] As to this film, I found it a bit lacking. Steven Poliakoff could have filled in some blanks. Was Queen Mary really as cold to little Prince John as the film portrays her?The rest of it I find is very well put together; all characters are flawless, but I was so impressed not only by the portrayal of Prince John, but also of his father King Edward: it is mind-boggling how believable the portrayal is. Maybe because this 2-part, 3 hour film is a lovely set of stories-within-a-story like I have never seen.All audiences should see this never-before-told outline of history. Parents will certainly weep at the sufferings of Prince John, who seems to have been autistic as a result of brain damage, plus epileptic. My wife teaches just such children. She was stunned to learn of the existence of the prince, who would have been, in her opinion, a great example for future generations.The stigma of such conditions at the time (ca. 1905 when John was little) prevented the public from seeing the afflicted. Even institutionalization was recommended--but the Queen refused. The family were brave about it: Prince John's grandfather King George V (played beautifully by Sir Michael Gambon) would have had a rage if it had been proposed in his time.Though there are hazes in this film (i.e., you never know exactly who's whom among the royal relatives) and a few excessively obscure people running around, it mostly centers around the prince and his overburdened father. Never have I seen it done so well. Someone said the Czar would have never spoken English with Russian accents as they did here...well, ever heard of ""the-folks-with-accents-so-we-can-keep-them-apart-from-the-others""?That is a point: I love the way this film handled the origin of the surname Windsor. At the time, in fact, no one was quite sure what it actually was...in the film they say Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, which was certainly Queen Victoria's surname after she married Prince Albert. Yet there was a question at the time whether it was Saxe-Coburg Gotha or Guelph (the surname of King George III, Queen Victoria's maiden name, and Queen Victoria's uncle/predecesor, King William IV).

793787,A2VE83MZF98ITY,B00015HXDG,"FrKurt Messick ""FrKurt Messick""","[14, 14]","This is a very touching tale of a lost 'footnote' from history - some histories of the British royal family come with handy genealogy charts, showing the progress of royals through the ages in graphic format.  Often, the younger children, the 'also rans' of the royal story, are left off the charts, unless they attained fame some other way, or unless they married well.  For those royal children who died in infancy or childhood, history is most unkind - they aren't even in the footnotes or indices.  Such is often the case for young Prince John - born with a disability that presented like epilepsy, he was (according to the custom of the time) kept out of the public eye.  Being rather low on the pecking order, he likely never would have attracted much attention, but with his disability, in a world that did not quite know how to regard those with disabilities, he was indeed an outcast, however royal.The teleplay shows an interplay of the private life of Prince John and his caregivers, particularly the deeply devoted servant and nanny, Lalla, and the public life of the royal family, as their lives became increasingly complex and involved in public duties due to the outbreak of the first world war.  The private life concentrates both on John and Lalla, as well as John and George, another of the younger royal children, close in age to John.  George went through the typical royal upbringing of boarding schools with a military emphasis; he was as out-of-place in that world as John was in the stuffy, rigidly-controlled royal world.  The camaraderie between George and John was touchingly portrayed in two different age brackets - one of early childhood (Daniel Williams playing John, and Brock-Everitt-Elwick playing George), and one of early adolescence (Matthew Thomas playing John, and Rollo Weeks playing George).  John, with his lack of inhibitions and oversized features (part of his disability) would occasionally make a truthful-if-not-quite-diplomatic statement, sometimes to a visiting royal, sometimes to the Prime Minister or other such dignitary.John's expression in life was done through art, music, and physical movements and expression.  He made paintings that showed a rather unique way of looking at the world, often over-emphasising details (such as crowns).  He also cared passionately for his gardens, working for hours at a time among the flowers and other plants.  Lalla (lovingly portrayed by Gina McKee) encouraged him, seeing in him more substance that doctors could with their brief examinations, and more than could his own parents, who rarely exhibited affection to John (or each other, or anyone else).It was a tense time in the world.  King George V (Tom Hollander) and his wife, the regal and inflexible Queen Mary (Miranda Richardson) tried desperately to navigate through a world becoming distinctly unfriendly toward royalty; just a generation prior, their family through Victoria's connections reigned in almost every major and many minor countries in Europe, which at that time through colonialism dominated the world; by the end of World War II, few monarchies were left, and those that were had no power or authority of their own.  One of the mistakes of the monarchs, brought out in this teleplay, was the assumption that they still had power.  In actual fact, they rarely even had influence.The scenes with the Russian royal family are interesting to note the similarities and differences between the ideas of royalty; the political leaders, too, are portrayed in somewhat flat but interesting characterisations.  Yet, as one other commentator has mentioned, the truly outstanding moment of the drama comes near the end, when John gets to give his performance for the family, and causes the family to reflect on their fortunes - after all, they were still there, silly.  Unlike the Russian royals, dead from the revolutionaries; unlike the German and Austrian royals, driven from office by the war; unlike countless other royal persons throughout Europe, dead or in exile from the aftermath, the British royal family (with its newly-minted British name) survived intact, if not in power.  One does indeed doubt the historicity of John's final performance for the family, but one can hope that it, or something like it, did indeed occur.The sets, costumes, and music are very well crafted and appropriately selected for this teleplay.  This is a programme I shall revisit again and again.

793790,A2TUA4VWCMNXI,B00015HXDG,John D. Cofield,"[230, 231]","Now that I have finally seen both episodes of The Lost Prince I can say confidently that it is one of the best Masterpiece Theater presentations in many years.  As the story of Prince John, the youngest child of King George V and Queen Mary of Great Britain, it is heartbreakingly evocative of the tragedy of one child and of the loss of  an entire world.The first episode opens with Prince John at about the age of three or four.  He is epileptic and probably autistic, handicaps which no one knew how to deal with effectively at the time and which were especially difficult to handle for a Royal on public display much of the time.  His family is fond of him but emotionally distant, and the only real love John receives is from his nurse Lalla and his next older brother Georgie.  Most of the time John is kept out of sight, though occasionally he gets to watch Royal occasions like the visit of the Russian Imperial Family to England (among the most beautiful of the scenes in this film, the Grand Duchesses and the Empress being elegant and charming) and the funeral of his grandfather Edward VII.  His parents are so bound up with their royal duties and conscious of their dignity that they can't unbend enough to risk being with Johnnie too often.  (With Queen Mary we are given an explanation for her apparent unfeelingness when we are shown glimpses of her own difficult and embarrassing childhood as the daughter of a very large and very undignified Princess.) Johnnie's handicaps make him refreshingly natural and spontaneous, which embarrasses his family when, for example, he repeats some unflattering comments he has overheard the Prime Minister make about the Royals. The first episode ends with the outbreak of World War I and Johnnie's removal to the countryside.In the second episode Johnnie is safely ensconced at a farm near Sandringham with Lalla and a small retinue of servants.  He rarely sees his family, who are busier with royal duties than ever.  His main source of news and information is Georgie, who is a miserable cadet at the Royal Naval College.  Georgie witnesses Britain's conversion to a war footing and the development of chauvinistic super-patriotic anti-German feelings.  These lead to the Royal Family coming under attack for its German origins, and to the dynasty's renaming itself the House of Windsor.  We also see the fate of the Romanovs after the fall of the Russian monarchy in 1917.  Although the British government at first agreed to accept the Romanovs as exiles, rising anti-monarchical sentiment in Britain so alarmed George V that he prevailed on his government to rescind the invitation.  This led to the eventual execution of the Romanovs and lifelong remorse by the King.During these war years Johnnie lived a quiet life, roaming the countryside and planting gardens.  His parents saw him rarely and were as distant as ever.  Eventually, Lalla prevailed on the King and Queen to hear Johnnie give a recital.  One of the happiest parts of The Lost Prince comes when the King and Queen find themselves listening to and enjoying the company of their youngest son, gradually unbending and smiling as he plays the trumpet and kicks a football. Johnnie lived only a short time after the end of World War I, but the King and Queen carried his memory with them for the rest of their lives. By the way, it may be of interest to know that his brother Georgie, to whom Johnnie gave the courage to pursue his own artistic interests, had difficulties of his own in his twenties and thirties with drug addiction and sundry other problems, finally dying in a plane crash in 1942. This Georgie was not King George VI, the father of the present Queen.  George VI's original name was Albert (Bertie) and he appears only as an extra in this film.The Lost Prince is a beautiful production.  Extreme royal aficionados will notice a few missteps (the Romanovs may have been Russian Royals, but they didn't have Russian accents the way this film portrayed them.  If anything, Nicholas and Alexandra and their children  had British accents!) but these are mere fumbles in the delivery of a beautiful and evocative series.",5,Heartbreakingly Evocative,1098662400,"10 25, 2004",2004,4153,"['Now', 'have', 'finally', 'seen', 'episodes', 'Lost', 'Prince', 'can', 'say', 'confidently', 'one', 'best', 'Masterpiece', 'Theater', 'presentations', 'many', 'years', 'story', 'Prince', 'John', 'youngest', 'child', 'King', 'George', 'V', 'Queen', 'Mary', 'Great', 'Britain', 'heartbreakingly', 'evocative', 'tragedy', 'one', 'child', 'loss', 'entire', 'world.The', 'first', 'opens', 'Prince', 'John', 'age', 'three', 'four', 'epileptic', 'probably', 'autistic', 'handicaps', 'one', 'knew', 'how', 'deal', 'effectively', 'time', 'were', 'especially', 'difficult', 'handle', 'Royal', 'public', 'display', 'much', 'time', 'family', 'fond', 'emotionally', 'distant', 'only', 'real', 'love', 'John', 'nurse', 'Lalla', 'next', 'older', 'brother', 'Georgie', 'Most', 'time', 'John', 'kept', 'sight', 'though', 'occasionally', 'watch', 'Royal', 'occasions', 'visit', 'Russian', 'Imperial', 'Family', 'England', 'most', 'beautiful', 'scenes', 'film', 'Grand', 'Duchesses', 'Empress', 'being', 'elegant', 'charming', 'funeral', 'grandfather', 'Edward', 'VII', 'parents', 'are', 'so', 'royal', 'duties', 'conscious', 'dignity', 'ca', ""n't"", 'unbend', 'enough', 'risk', 'being', 'Johnnie', 'too', 'often', 'Queen', 'Mary', 'are', 'given', 'explanation', 'apparent', 'unfeelingness', 'when', 'are', 'shown', 'glimpses', 'own', 'difficult', 'embarrassing', 'childhood', 'daughter', 'very', 'large', 'very', 'undignified', 'Princess', 'Johnnie', 'handicaps', 'make', 'refreshingly', 'natural', 'spontaneous', 'family', 'when', 'example', 'unflattering', 'comments', 'overheard', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'make', 'Royals', 'first', 'episode', 'outbreak', 'World', 'War', 'Johnnie', 'removal', 'countryside.In', 'second', 'episode', 'Johnnie', 'safely', 'ensconced', 'farm', 'Sandringham', 'Lalla', 'small', 'retinue', 'servants', 'rarely', 'family', 'who', 'are', 'busier', 'royal', 'duties', 'ever', 'main', 'source', 'news', 'information', 'Georgie', 'who', 'miserable', 'cadet', 'Royal', 'Naval', 'College', 'Georgie', 'Britain', 'conversion', 'war', 'footing', 'development', 'chauvinistic', 'super-patriotic', 'anti-German', 'feelings', 'lead', 'Royal', 'Family', 'coming', 'attack', 'German', 'origins', 'dynasty', 'renaming', 'House', 'Windsor', 'also', 'see', 'fate', 'Romanovs', 'fall', 'Russian', 'monarchy', '1917', 'British', 'government', 'first', 'agreed', 'accept', 'Romanovs', 'exiles', 'rising', 'anti-monarchical', 'sentiment', 'Britain', 'so', 'alarmed', 'George', 'V', 'prevailed', 'government', 'rescind', 'invitation', 'led', 'eventual', 'execution', 'Romanovs', 'lifelong', 'remorse', 'King.During', 'war', 'years', 'Johnnie', 'lived', 'quiet', 'life', 'roaming', 'countryside', 'planting', 'gardens', 'parents', 'saw', 'rarely', 'were', 'as', 'distant', 'ever', 'Eventually', 'Lalla', 'prevailed', 'King', 'Queen', 'hear', 'Johnnie', 'give', 'recital', 'One', 'happiest', 'parts', 'Lost', 'Prince', 'when', 'King', 'Queen', 'find', 'listening', 'enjoying', 'company', 'youngest', 'son', 'gradually', 'unbending', 'smiling', 'trumpet', 'football', 'Johnnie', 'lived', 'only', 'short', 'time', 'end', 'World', 'War', 'King', 'Queen', 'carried', 'memory', 'rest', 'lives', 'way', 'may', 'be', 'interest', 'know', 'brother', 'Georgie', 'whom', 'Johnnie', 'gave', 'courage', 'pursue', 'own', 'artistic', 'interests', 'had', 'difficulties', 'own', 'twenties', 'thirties', 'drug', 'addiction', 'sundry', 'other', 'problems', 'finally', 'dying', 'plane', 'crash', '1942', 'Georgie', 'was', 'not', 'King', 'George', 'VI', 'father', 'present', 'Queen', 'George', 'VI', 'original', 'name', 'was', 'Albert', 'Bertie', 'only', 'extra', 'film.The', 'Lost', 'Prince', 'beautiful', 'production', 'Extreme', 'royal', 'aficionados', 'will', 'notice', 'few', 'missteps', 'Romanovs', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'Russian', 'Royals', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'Russian', 'accents', 'way', 'film', 'portrayed', 'anything', 'Nicholas', 'Alexandra', 'children', 'had', 'British', 'accents', 'are', 'mere', 'fumbles', 'delivery', 'beautiful', 'evocative', 'series']",N/A

What comes through to me over and over again is that although the royal parents may love their royal children, showers of love and affection are simply ""not done.""  The children are raised by nannies, governesses and other support staff.  They are then shipped off to far reaches of the kingdom and slapped into various boarding schools.The Lost Prince is about Prince Johnnie, son of George V and Mary, who has at the very least epilepsy and some learning difficulties.  As was the custom of the day, such frailties were kept secret from one's subjects (his cousin Alexei Romanov's haemophilia was never public knowledge either).  In Prince Johnnie's case, he was hidden away from public view and finally removed from his family entirely, presumably to maintain public trust in the strength of the dynasty.As sad his life may appear to us 21st century types, I am left wondering if Johnnie didn't have the better deal than the rest of his siblings.  He was loved and adored by his nannies.  He spent his time living in a world of his own design, while maintaining a tether to his surroundings and the people in it.  I look at his two most famous brothers, Edward and George VI and I have to believe Johnnie had a happier (albeit short) life.Was his life and situation poignant? Yes, absolutely! But, in the years after Johnnie's death, would anyone have wanted to trade places with his more famous brothers, Edward and George VI?  Neither had the tools or emotional confidence to face the challenges that nearly crushed them separately.  Johnnie on the other hand spent his last days tilting at windmills and romping in the English countryside.Children with disabilities have been treated so inhumanely, due in part to parental helplessness, ignorance and shame.  Johnnie, however, was lucky; instead of being locked away in an asylum or lobotomized like Rosemary Kennedy, his parents simply made him disappear - into his own world.I don't agree with their choice at all, but given that up until Princes William and Harry, the main sources of love for British princes appears to have been hired help and not from the parents, little Johnnie did okay.The Lost Prince is a lovely movie that will touch you immensely - at least it did me.",5,Lovely film about an almost forgotten child,1323388800,"12 9, 2011",2011,2327,"['Anglophile', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'lots', 'documentaries', 'films', 'British', 'Royal', 'families', 'What', 'over', 'again', 'royal', 'parents', 'may', 'love', 'royal', 'children', 'showers', 'love', 'affection', 'are', 'simply', 'not', 'done', 'children', 'are', 'raised', 'nannies', 'governesses', 'other', 'support', 'staff', 'are', 'then', 'shipped', 'off', 'far', 'reaches', 'kingdom', 'slapped', 'various', 'boarding', 'schools.The', 'Lost', 'Prince', 'Prince', 'Johnnie', 'son', 'George', 'V', 'Mary', 'who', 'very', 'least', 'epilepsy', 'learning', 'difficulties', 'was', 'custom', 'day', 'such', 'frailties', 'were', 'kept', 'secret', 'one', 'subjects', 'cousin', 'Alexei', 'Romanov', 'haemophilia', 'was', 'never', 'public', 'knowledge', 'Prince', 'Johnnie', 'case', 'was', 'hidden', 'away', 'public', 'view', 'finally', 'removed', 'family', 'entirely', 'presumably', 'maintain', 'public', 'trust', 'strength', 'dynasty.As', 'sad', 'life', 'may', 'appear', '21st', 'century', 'types', 'am', 'left', 'wondering', 'Johnnie', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'better', 'deal', 'rest', 'siblings', 'was', 'loved', 'adored', 'nannies', 'spent', 'time', 'living', 'world', 'own', 'design', 'maintaining', 'tether', 'surroundings', 'people', 'look', 'two', 'most', 'famous', 'brothers', 'Edward', 'George', 'VI', 'have', 'believe', 'Johnnie', 'had', 'happier', 'short', 'life.Was', 'life', 'situation', 'poignant', 'Yes', 'absolutely', 'years', 'Johnnie', 'death', 'would', 'anyone', 'have', 'wanted', 'trade', 'places', 'more', 'famous', 'brothers', 'Edward', 'George', 'VI', 'had', 'tools', 'emotional', 'confidence', 'face', 'challenges', 'nearly', 'crushed', 'separately', 'Johnnie', 'other', 'hand', 'spent', 'last', 'days', 'tilting', 'windmills', 'romping', 'English', 'countryside.Children', 'disabilities', 'have', 'been', 'treated', 'so', 'inhumanely', 'due', 'part', 'parental', 'helplessness', 'ignorance', 'shame', 'Johnnie', 'however', 'was', 'lucky', 'instead', 'being', 'locked', 'away', 'asylum', 'lobotomized', 'Rosemary', 'Kennedy', 'parents', 'simply', 'made', 'disappear', 'own', 'world.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'choice', 'given', 'up', 'Princes', 'William', 'Harry', 'main', 'sources', 'love', 'British', 'princes', 'have', 'been', 'hired', 'help', 'not', 'parents', 'little', 'Johnnie', 'did', 'okay.The', 'Lost', 'Prince', 'lovely', 'movie', 'will', 'touch', 'immensely', 'least', 'did']",N/A

793799,ATZONTF6SUZEP,B00015HXDG,Matthew Patton,"[13, 34]","There was once a cute-but-dumpy German princess who became Queen of England because one of her relatives, who was King at the time, hadn't succeeded in fathering a child within the bounds of wedlock.  So she married one of her cousins, had many, many children (ten, to be exact)and after she had a son to inherit the family business, was left with the problem of what to do with the rest.Marry them off the THEIR cousins--this exchange of bodily fluids made said Queen of England the center of an imperial web, but also meant that there were relatives We Don't Talk About.Like one of the queen's great-grandchildren, Prince John, who was epileptic, possibly autistic, and considered to be an embarassment.  Unlike the Czar's son, he didn't bleed all over the winter tapestries, but he had a tendency to repeat things people said about each other and to have uncontrollable fits and so his parents, who weren't exactly affectionate with the kids who didn't have such conspicuous problems, banished him to a cottage on one of the royal estates and basically pretended that he didn't exist.  Queen Mary, his mother, was said to have regretted this in later years.  You wouldn't know it from looking at the photos.  Actually, you wouldn't know that she had any feelings, except some suggestions around the eyes that she laced her corset a bit tightly.As long as this very long TV film sticks to the title character, it has some real emotional pull; Prince John may have had severe medical problems, but he was't a lush or drug addict or inclined to marry Mrs. Simpson (which might drive you towards the previously mentioned conditions), and he was loved, by a nanny who was referred to condescendingly by The Family as ""Lalla"" but who obviously was made of much finer stuff than her Betters.  But writer/director Stephen Poliakoff is ultimately too forgiving, the tenderness strays over to the awful parents George VI and Queen Mary and Goerge's degenerate father Edward VII (who was very fond of little girls--sort of in the manner that Humbert Humbert was).  The British Royals were, I suppose, marginally less stupid than their German and Russian cousins, but they were also protected by their constitutional powerlessness--in this case, they could point in all honesty to the idiot generals and say that it was all their fault--at least the military stuff.  But Queen Victoria's dynastic ambitions (Victory Through Incest)were the ultimate villain, and in that ugly mess, the British Royals were as implicated as anyone else.",3,When Cousins Marry . . .,1135468800,"12 25, 2005",2005,2525,"['was', 'once', 'cute-but-dumpy', 'German', 'princess', 'who', 'became', 'Queen', 'England', 'one', 'relatives', 'who', 'was', 'King', 'time', 'had', ""n't"", 'succeeded', 'fathering', 'child', 'bounds', 'wedlock', 'married', 'one', 'cousins', 'had', 'many', 'many', 'children', 'ten', 'be', 'exact', 'had', 'son', 'inherit', 'family', 'business', 'was', 'left', 'problem', 'what', 'do', 'rest.Marry', 'off', 'THEIR', 'cousins', 'exchange', 'bodily', 'fluids', 'made', 'said', 'Queen', 'England', 'center', 'imperial', 'web', 'also', 'meant', 'were', 'relatives', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Talk', 'About.Like', 'one', 'queen', 'great-grandchildren', 'Prince', 'John', 'who', 'was', 'epileptic', 'possibly', 'autistic', 'considered', 'be', 'embarassment', 'Czar', 'son', 'did', ""n't"", 'bleed', 'winter', 'tapestries', 'had', 'tendency', 'repeat', 'things', 'people', 'said', 'other', 'have', 'uncontrollable', 'fits', 'so', 'parents', 'who', 'were', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'affectionate', 'kids', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'such', 'conspicuous', 'problems', 'banished', 'cottage', 'one', 'royal', 'estates', 'basically', 'pretended', 'did', ""n't"", 'exist', 'Queen', 'Mary', 'mother', 'was', 'said', 'have', 'regretted', 'later', 'years', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'looking', 'photos', 'Actually', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'had', 'feelings', 'suggestions', 'eyes', 'laced', 'corset', 'bit', 'tightly.As', 'long', 'very', 'long', 'TV', 'film', 'sticks', 'title', 'character', 'real', 'emotional', 'pull', 'Prince', 'John', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'severe', 'medical', 'problems', 'lush', 'drug', 'addict', 'inclined', 'marry', 'Mrs.', 'Simpson', 'might', 'drive', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'conditions', 'was', 'loved', 'nanny', 'who', 'was', 'referred', 'condescendingly', 'Family', 'Lalla', 'who', 'obviously', 'was', 'made', 'much', 'finer', 'stuff', 'Betters', 'writer/director', 'Stephen', 'Poliakoff', 'ultimately', 'too', 'forgiving', 'tenderness', 'awful', 'parents', 'George', 'VI', 'Queen', 'Mary', 'Goerge', 'degenerate', 'father', 'Edward', 'VII', 'who', 'was', 'very', 'fond', 'little', 'girls', 'sort', 'manner', 'Humbert', 'Humbert', 'was', 'British', 'Royals', 'were', 'suppose', 'marginally', 'less', 'stupid', 'German', 'Russian', 'cousins', 'were', 'also', 'protected', 'constitutional', 'powerlessness', 'case', 'could', 'point', 'honesty', 'idiot', 'generals', 'say', 'was', 'fault', 'least', 'military', 'stuff', 'Queen', 'Victoria', 'dynastic', 'ambitions', 'Victory', 'Through', 'Incest', 'were', 'ultimate', 'villain', 'ugly', 'mess', 'British', 'Royals', 'were', 'as', 'implicated', 'anyone', 'else']",N/A

793805,A2A1XYSB692L6J,B00015HXDG,"Patricia ""A Reader""","[4, 4]","AS AN ANGLOPHILE, AND ""ROYALFILE"", I had come across the name of""Prince John"", the fourth son of King George V and Queen Mary, in som of my readings on the Windsors -- but the descriptions of him were usually no more than a name, or perhaps a statement that he was both retarded and had epilepsy.  I had also read that he had his own home, away from the rest of the royal family, and was looked after by a devoted lady-servant named ""Lala"", and had died at the age of 13.  I had seen a picture of him as an infant, (before his illnesses were discovered), happily sitting on his mother's lap...and he sure didn't look retarded to me.  I suppose, had I looked futher, I might have gained more knowledge, just by reading, about this ""lost prince"".  However, this fascinating TV Movie filled in just about every gap for me.  I am very glad I saw it, and very, very glad it was produced!The time period here is gracefully reproduced, as are all the leading people in Prince John's small world.  These consisted mostly of his family, and Lala, his attendant.  I had not known that his brother, Prince George, (later to become the Duke of Glouchester -- pronounced ""Glous-ter""), was the only one in his family to take a personal interest in Prince John.  It was fascinating and enlightening to see the two little royal brothers together, and also heart-breaking to realize the rest of Prince John's family hardly cared for him at all.One of the most memorable parts of this film was the visit of the Romanov cousins to England.  The four daughters flitted aroundPrince John like winged fairies -- smiling, enchanting, and beautiful.  The silent meetng of Prince John with the Czarivitch -- almost the same age, and also with a handicap kept secret from most people -- was unforgettable.  How I wished the two of them had had more time to be together!  How I wished even more, that the customs of that tume had NOT been to regard handicaps, (especially in Royal Families), as shameful, and something to be kept hidden.  Had the real BRAVERY of both the Czarivitch, and Prince John, in confronting their illnesses, been SHOWN to the public at large, it would have ENDEARED these princes to the public, and not shamed or horrified them.  The Russian Revolution might even ave been prevented, had the Czarvitch's illness, (and his brave fighting of it), been known.  Certainly, Prince John would have lived a more normal, (and probably much longer), life.Yet, even in 1940s, such almost-medieval attitudes towards illness prevailed -- witness the carefull keeping-from-the-public of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's polio, at that time.  Thank goodness times have changed!  But they changed too late for poor Prince John.This is a movie to be watched by all: Royalists, those with illnesses, their families, and the public at large.  In this movie, Prince John is shown to be a quite normal little boy, who DID have epilepsy, but who's retardation -- if any -- was extremely and very minor.  Had he grown, he might have had a special insight into ""ordinary"" people's problems, and been able to connect with them more -- thus not only making ""ordinary"" people happy, but also strengthening their bond, (and allegience!), to the Royal family.  As it was -- he died at the age of 13, (the same age as, a few years earlier, his cousin, the Czarivitch had died, though from very different causes.)It was over three-quarters-of-a-century, from the time Prince John died, to the time this movie was made. A little long in coming...but certainly worth the wait.  Charming, historical, and devasting, this movie will remain with the viewer for a long, long time, after he or she has seen it!

There is relatively little actually known about Prince John or his life or disabilities, which meant that we got a lot of images of John gazing into space  and wandering the halls,(little more, I suspect could be expected of the young actor playing the younger John), repeated apologies from his nurse to Queen Mary that she'd let him wander off, and a great deal of irrelevant (to the story, anyway) and equally uninteresting material dealing with his parents and cousins.  The ending was utterly abrupt. (Not to spoil anything but --- he was playing. He died.)Historically there was also much to wonder about.  Watching the film one would assume that Johnny had only one brother. The older siblings were seen VERY briefly  in a couple of early scenes, and mentioned in passing at the end, but beyond that, we only ever saw Georgie.  Dream images of the Russian grand-duchesses got more screen-time than Johnnie's real family. We got a detailed family tree (as the boys looked out the window before Edward's funeral) of many of  their cousins who were kings and emperors of other nations, while other characters (Prime Ministers, ""Fat Mary"") came and went with barely  a hint to their actual identities. This was especially problematic since the actors in the roles rarely had more than the most passing resemblances to their real-life counterparts. I ASSUME that the royal lady in one of the early scenes fretting about her shoes was the Tsarina .. but it was never made clear.  Nor was the relevance of the scene. The actor playing Kaiser Wilhelm (again, questionably referred to in the film as 'Cousin Bill' -- I've never seen or read any indication that he was known as anything but ""Willie"" to his English relations -- though if anyone can correct me this I'll stand properly chastened) was much too young.Surely the Queen would have addressed Lalla as ""Mrs. Bill"", at least during formal meetings -- the position of head nurse in a royal household was one of considerable respect and importance. Known history also indicates that the complete separation of Johnny from the family didn't occur until the move to the farm in 1917. Before that he accompanied the rest of the family on moves between royal households and was seen by visitors and guests and his parents and siblings.Again, very disappointing. I'd hoped to learn more about this admittedly shadowy figure of Edwardian history ... and instead got a glossy 3 hour bit of nothingness.",2,Slow ......,1318118400,"10 9, 2011",2011,2723,"['very', 'much', 'looked', 'forward', 'receiving', 'watching', 'DVD', 'being', 'great', 'fan', 'historical', 'films', 'general', 'pre-current-day', 'British', 'royalty', 'particular.I', 'was', 'alas', 'VERY', 'disappointed.The', 'main', 'problem', 'was', 'was', 'about', '3', 'times', 'as', 'long', 'needed', 'be', 'relatively', 'little', 'actually', 'known', 'Prince', 'John', 'life', 'disabilities', 'meant', 'got', 'lot', 'images', 'John', 'gazing', 'space', 'wandering', 'halls', 'little', 'more', 'suspect', 'could', 'be', 'expected', 'young', 'actor', 'playing', 'younger', 'John', 'repeated', 'apologies', 'nurse', 'Queen', 'Mary', ""'d"", 'let', 'wander', 'off', 'great', 'deal', 'irrelevant', 'story', 'anyway', 'equally', 'uninteresting', 'material', 'dealing', 'parents', 'cousins', 'ending', 'was', 'utterly', 'abrupt', 'Not', 'spoil', 'anything', 'was', 'playing', 'died', 'Historically', 'was', 'also', 'much', 'wonder', 'Watching', 'film', 'one', 'would', 'assume', 'Johnny', 'had', 'only', 'one', 'brother', 'older', 'siblings', 'were', 'seen', 'VERY', 'briefly', 'couple', 'early', 'scenes', 'mentioned', 'passing', 'end', 'only', 'ever', 'saw', 'Georgie', 'Dream', 'images', 'Russian', 'grand-duchesses', 'got', 'more', 'screen-time', 'Johnnie', 'real', 'family', 'got', 'detailed', 'family', 'tree', 'boys', 'looked', 'out', 'window', 'Edward', 'funeral', 'many', 'cousins', 'who', 'were', 'kings', 'emperors', 'other', 'nations', 'other', 'characters', 'Prime', 'Ministers', 'Fat', 'Mary', 'came', 'went', 'barely', 'hint', 'actual', 'identities', 'was', 'especially', 'problematic', 'actors', 'roles', 'rarely', 'had', 'more', 'most', 'passing', 'resemblances', 'real-life', 'counterparts', 'ASSUME', 'royal', 'lady', 'one', 'early', 'scenes', 'fretting', 'shoes', 'was', 'Tsarina', '..', 'was', 'never', 'made', 'clear', 'was', 'relevance', 'scene', 'actor', 'playing', 'Kaiser', 'Wilhelm', 'again', 'questionably', 'referred', 'film', ""'Cousin"", 'Bill', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'read', 'indication', 'was', 'known', 'anything', 'Willie', 'English', 'relations', 'anyone', 'can', 'correct', ""'ll"", 'stand', 'properly', 'chastened', 'was', 'much', 'too', 'young.Surely', 'Queen', 'would', 'have', 'addressed', 'Lalla', 'Mrs.', 'Bill', 'least', 'formal', 'meetings', 'position', 'head', 'nurse', 'royal', 'household', 'was', 'one', 'considerable', 'respect', 'importance', 'Known', 'history', 'also', 'complete', 'separation', 'Johnny', 'family', 'did', ""n't"", 'occur', 'move', 'farm', '1917', 'accompanied', 'rest', 'family', 'moves', 'royal', 'households', 'was', 'seen', 'visitors', 'guests', 'parents', 'siblings.Again', 'very', 'disappointing', ""'d"", 'hoped', 'learn', 'more', 'admittedly', 'shadowy', 'figure', 'Edwardian', 'history', 'instead', 'got', 'glossy', '3', 'hour', 'bit', 'nothingness']",N/A

Georgie (after his older brother's abdication many years later) is to become George VI, and Johnnie, afflicted with epilepsy, is shunted away from public view as well as the company of his family, where he grows up under the care of a devoted retinue, then dies at the age of 14.Poliakoff's scripting and direction make this story fragmented and starkly cool, representing life in the royal family's many residences as claustrophobic and its members as emotionally distant from each other. Georgie is the winning center of warmth and intelligence in the film, befriending a close aid of the king's (played wonderfully by Bill Nighy) and regarding his young brother with unwavering affection. Also at the center of the film is Johnnie's devoted caretaker (Gina McKee) who struggles unfailingly to find room for him in his parents' hearts.Meanwhile, events in Europe have their inevitable impact as both king and queen succumb to the dark forces that seem ready to sweep across war-time Britain. And their cousins, the Emperor of Russia and his family, are assassinated while Britain hesitates to offer them refuge from the Bolshevik Revolution.A powerful film, without many moments of emotional release. The DVD includes a commentary that relates the historical research the the script is based on, as well as liberties taken.

It is a well-made and highly engaging historical movie with strong cast and touching human expression. Gina McKee (of the earlier ""Forsyte Saga"" series, plays the nanny and nurse to the sickly, epileptic and eternally childish Prince Johnnie, who was kept hidden from public eye during the years before World War I. The Royal Family of England, Queen Mary (played superbly by Miranda Richardson) and King George V, are portrayed with a human touch and do not come off as distant historical figures. The movie is rather long but worth watching. Prince Johnnie is treated as the hero of the movie, as the voice of reason, despite his illness and his position as the weak one. The plot follows historical fact accurately. European monarchy was shaken off its foundation with the outbreak of World War I. King Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary was assasinated by Gavrilo Princip, a radical, and war erupted. Further revolutions in Russia as the Communists take over and slaughter the Romanov family- Czar Nicholas, his wife Alexandra and their daughters including Anastasia. This movie has beautiful locations, cinematography and a great musical score. Other than the original music for the film, excerpts from classical music are presented as Johnnie listens to a phonograph, among the works he hears is Beethoven's  Symphony No. 7 finale- the allegro con brio. A great movie. On DVD, there is commentary by the director Stephen Poliakoff and insight on the time period of World War I ""The King, The Kaiser and the Czar"", a look at the three powers in Europe- the king of England, the German Kaiser Wilhelm and the Czar, who all make appearances within the context of the film.",5,The Best Historical Drama As Of Late For The BBC,1101600000,"11 28, 2004",2004,1745,"['Masterpiece', 'Theatre', 'KCET', 'aired', 'two-part', 'movie', 'only', 'weeks', 'ago', 'well-made', 'highly', 'engaging', 'historical', 'movie', 'strong', 'cast', 'touching', 'human', 'expression', 'Gina', 'McKee', 'earlier', 'Forsyte', 'Saga', 'series', 'nanny', 'nurse', 'sickly', 'epileptic', 'eternally', 'childish', 'Prince', 'Johnnie', 'who', 'was', 'kept', 'hidden', 'public', 'eye', 'years', 'World', 'War', 'Royal', 'Family', 'England', 'Queen', 'Mary', 'played', 'superbly', 'Miranda', 'Richardson', 'King', 'George', 'V', 'are', 'portrayed', 'human', 'touch', 'do', 'not', 'come', 'off', 'distant', 'historical', 'figures', 'movie', 'rather', 'long', 'worth', 'watching', 'Prince', 'Johnnie', 'treated', 'hero', 'movie', 'voice', 'reason', 'illness', 'position', 'weak', 'one', 'plot', 'historical', 'fact', 'accurately', 'European', 'monarchy', 'was', 'shaken', 'off', 'foundation', 'outbreak', 'World', 'War', 'King', 'Franz', 'Ferdinand', 'Austria-Hungary', 'was', 'assasinated', 'Gavrilo', 'Princip', 'radical', 'war', 'erupted', 'Further', 'revolutions', 'Russia', 'Communists', 'take', 'slaughter', 'Romanov', 'family-', 'Czar', 'Nicholas', 'wife', 'Alexandra', 'daughters', 'including', 'Anastasia', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'locations', 'cinematography', 'great', 'musical', 'score', 'Other', 'original', 'music', 'film', 'excerpts', 'classical', 'music', 'are', 'presented', 'Johnnie', 'phonograph', 'works', 'Beethoven', 'Symphony', 'No', '7', 'finale-', 'allegro', 'con', 'brio', 'great', 'movie', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'director', 'Stephen', 'Poliakoff', 'insight', 'time', 'period', 'World', 'War', 'King', 'Kaiser', 'Czar', 'look', 'three', 'powers', 'Europe-', 'king', 'England', 'German', 'Kaiser', 'Wilhelm', 'Czar', 'who', 'make', 'appearances', 'context', 'film']",N/A
