322585,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,6302605067,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[31, 32]","With a superb cast and sensitive direction by Robert Wise, ""Until They Sail"" follows the lives of 4 sisters, who deal with the tragedy and loneliness of war from different perspectives, and in different ways. Joan Fontaine is Anne, who is rigid and virtuous, and Jean Simmons is Barbara, who has only been a bride for a month when her husband leaves for the war. Piper Laurie is Delia, who in desperation marries an obnoxious cad, because he's the only man in town, and Sandra Dee is Evelyn, whose enthusiasm for life cannot be dampened, even by the uncertainty and sadness of the time. Dee was only 13 when this film was made, and it was her delightful screen debut.Woven into the women's lives are the Americans, who are stationed in New Zealand, among them Jack (Paul Newman), whose principal job in the military is to investigate the potential brides of the enlisted men. After a bad marriage, Jack relies on the comfort of whiskey to get him through the night, until he meets Barbara. Based on a James Michener story, ""Until They Sail"" is a marvelous wartime melodrama, and though it is essentially a ""woman's film,"" can be appreciated by anyone who likes fine acting and filmmaking. The b&w; cinematography by Joseph Ruttenberg is lovely, and when the camera focuses on Jean Simmons's luminous eyes, one realizes what a great actress she was, and how she was able to convey depth and passion with just a look. ""Until They Sail"" is an underrated classic that depicts the emotional toll on the women left behind in a way that is unique, insightful, and memorable.

At that time I found it just a bit depressing and not a romance to my liking.  It just didn't have the dreamy and romantic  quality I wanted in a film...Then!!  After all it was 1957 and I was all of 20.Still I never forget it.  Lately I have been viewing other movies I remember.  This one was not out in DVD until recently and then I had to wait while it was reordered.  Could it be that people are discovering early Paul Newman and vintage films of good quality?Mainly the story line is about four sisters: Sandra Dee, Joan Fontaine,  (Rebecca, Jane Eyre, Suspicion), Piper Laurie, and Jean Simmons who  play out their lives in New Zealand while their men (boys)in uniform have sailed to distant duties.  Meanwhile  American soldiers are stationed in their port cities.  The window scene oft repeated in the film shows ships sailing and reflects the theme visually.Sandra Dee's first movie proved to launch her into starring roles within a decade..even a Douglas Sirk melodrama with Lana Turner as her mother. She reflects a brilliant maturity in this one considering she was 13 playing a teenager from 14-18.""Until they Sail"" is filmed in b/w which reflects the somber mood of the story.  This is no Sirk melodrama like ""Written on the Wind"" or ""Magnificent obsession."" but this is good and worth viewing.  Mainly the film shows  the things that can happen during wartime at any time in any country.  The home boys go off to war and the women are left to trace their journeys on a wall map while the visiting soldiers gracious accept hospitality and sometimes more from their female hosts.This is a Paul Newman I would like to have seen more of back then before he took on the tough and cynical kind of roles he became famous for.  He is vulnerable and sensitive and I liked him like that.  Joan Fontaine and Charles Drake share tender scenes and moments together.  Piper Laurie does a wonderful take on the promiscuious  sister.  She is someone you have trouble liking at all in this film up to her untimely demise.  She makes you feel that way because she is that good in this role.  But it is Jean Simmons as the widowed sister who falls in love with Newman who carries the picture to it's predictable conclusion.I didn't read the Mitchner story upon which the book is based;  but I do wonder if they changed the ending to one of the more standard Hollywood ones. (not saying how it ends, however)  Mainly though much goes on before and until they sail and sometimes even afterwards.

This is what I wrote before:I too think this is an excellent film, I recently rewatched it on TCM.  I wish some company would put out a dvd of it.  Meeting in Australia during World War II, the gorgeous Jean Simmons and charismatic Paul Newman have a very grown up, slow starting romance, full of wary sadness.  Joan Fontaine is effective as the judgmental sister who eventually melts.  Sandra Dee is indeed charming in an early role.  And Piper Laurie is excellent and a little scary as the ""promiscuous,"" troubled sister.  One reason it's so first-rate is the screenplay is by Robert Anderson, the talented writer of the play ""Tea and Sympathy,"" and the screenwriter of the film ""The Nun's Story.""  Among other things, he had a real affinity for writing sensitive, nuanced women.  And the director is Robert Wise, an eclectic director who has made many great movies.  Put out a dvd of this, someone.Note: this film has been put on DVD-R where Amazon copies on demand the film in question onto a DVD.  The quality is usually good.  It does mean there are no extras, including no ""scene selection"" and no closed captions.  You can skip ahead in the film, chunk by chunk; but you can't just go to ""scene 22"" (as a made up example) if it's your favorite scene, you have to go from scene 1 to scene 2 to scene 3, etc.However, it's a very engrossing, adult film.

322593,AYA9ZUS9Z0BVW,6302605067,"Jane Pensive ""a film fan""","[2, 3]","...which showcases the acting talents of Jean Simmons, Joan Fontaine, and Sandra Dee. The plot is based on a James Michener short story about the temptations of fraternizing with New Zealand women during the lonely experience of American GI's during WWII. The theme is that ""nice"" girls don't sleep with Yanks just because all of the  New Zealand men are away fighting the Japanese, or do they? When the  Americans arrive well into the war in the Pacific, they bring money, presents, Yankee charm, and virility to some ladies who are starved for  male companionship. In this story four sisters are challenged to remain the  ladies they were raised to  be despite the  overwhelming presence of  the Yanks. Only Sandra Dee and Jean Simmons come away  unscathed by their  encounters with the American GI's.Most  impressive is Sandra Dee as the youngest sister in a nice bit of  acting in which she must temper her youthful  enthusiasm with the realities of succombing to men who are going to go home alone one day. Of  course Jean Simmons brings a thoughtful approach to her  war widow who is very attracted to Paul Newman. (Not sure about the aura around Newman. Here he is a divorced, alcoholic officer who is really too short to be a leading man for any but the most petite leading lady). Joan Fontaine is very good as the uptight, morally erect, eldest sister who falls for dishy Charles Drake (who could blame her). Piper Laurie is the  sexpot, middle sister who gives what I think is a turgid performance devoid of any sexiness or charm.This is the kind of story that director Robert Wise excelled at. He brings authenticity to material which could be trite in another director's hands. Wise consistently creates lots of sexual tension in his films, which lends interest to otherwise banal  situations. Wise was a really versatile director who made some wonderful little comedies,  big musicals, and romantic dramas (""This Could Be the Night,"" ""The Sound of Music,"" and ""Two For the Seesaw"" to name a few).

It was the last thing I expected to hear, but so welcome on a day of national mourning.  Eydie sings a phrase or two, and a man who must have won the National Whistling Contest whistles either the same phrase, or a phrase that descends instead of descending, etc.  In this way the song parallels the central movement of Robert Wise's film, a series of insinuative statements and ironic, sometimes bittersweet counterstatements.  (I've since found out that the whistler in question is none other than Muzzy Marcellino, the man who whistled the themes from The High and the Mighty and (later on) The Good, The Bad and the Ugly!)Anyhow the movie itself is in black and white, and if only they had spent a little bit more in color, then I'd be ready to declare this a masterpiece on the level of John Sturges' By Love Possessed or Douglas Sirk's Magnificent Obsession.  The black and white makes the New Zealand settings look tacky, cheap, though perhaps in the 1950s people ooohed and aahed when they saw Christchurch on the screen.  Wise's darting camera does its best to give the movie the sweep and motion of a historical epic, but we don't feel the grandeur.  In a way it hardly matters what with all the human emotions roiling on the screen, any time Piper Laurie pipes up, with her sluttishly tight sweaters and her eyes on the glittering sheaf of American GI wealth and chocolates, the movie takes off with its own sizzle.  It's not that Piper Laurie is a great actress or anything like that, but Robert Wise gives her the signal to just tear up the narrative as the bad sister, Delia.  ""Dee,"" they call her in times of kinder reminiscence.  They never know what last name to give to her, as she uses the name of whatever man has the most money.This is one of those homefront movies that details not only the four sisters losing every man they had--a husband, a brother, a boyfriend, a father--but gaining replacements for them back via the steady supply of new American blood to replace their own,.depleted, Kiwi energy.  A Cold War movie in many ways, Until They Sail shows us an American army in fine fettle, fighting trim, guaranteed to win the war for the frail females--though to be fair, it does show us some foul soldiers, fully capable of Abu Ghraib style atrocities; it's like the Ernest Borgnine character in From Here to Eternity multiplied by hundreds.  But good men too, like Charles Drake and Paul Newman, men with needs but who don't abuse hospitality.  Joan Fontaine learns this lesson best of all, and the extreme arc of her character must have intrigued the flighty, sensitive actress, but it's still hard to swallow that she of all people would go off to Nowhere USA based on a grim telegram which any sensible person would shudder at.  But that's enough spoilers for me.  Suffice it to say that Fontaine and Laurie give performances equal to their more celebrated roles, and Jean Simmons and Sandra Dee are not far behind.  For once, Jean Simmons is playing a heroine untrammeled by Freudian traumas, while Dee is weirdly cast as a young girl totally devoted to the opposite sex, and she was what, twelve when she made this?  You'd think they'd have tried to cast somebody a little bit older, but perhaps this was the era of Lolita, and Robert Wise was dipping a toe into that piquant, pellucid water of potential.",5,Wise Virgins,1377475200,"08 26, 2013",2013,3551,"['watched', 'picture', 'day', 'Eydie', 'Gorme', 'died', 'was', 'thunderstruck', 'when', 'credits', 'rolled', 'David', 'Raksin', 'theme', 'music', 'started', 'playing', 'Eydie', 'distinctive', 'voice', 'started', 'singing', 'theme', 'song', 'was', 'last', 'thing', 'expected', 'hear', 'so', 'welcome', 'day', 'national', 'mourning', 'Eydie', 'phrase', 'two', 'man', 'who', 'must', 'have', 'won', 'National', 'Whistling', 'Contest', 'same', 'phrase', 'phrase', 'instead', 'descending', 'etc', 'way', 'song', 'central', 'movement', 'Robert', 'Wise', 'film', 'series', 'insinuative', 'statements', 'ironic', 'sometimes', 'bittersweet', 'counterstatements', ""'ve"", 'found', 'whistler', 'question', 'none', 'other', 'Muzzy', 'Marcellino', 'man', 'who', 'whistled', 'themes', 'High', 'Mighty', 'later', 'Good', 'Bad', 'Ugly', 'Anyhow', 'movie', 'black', 'white', 'only', 'had', 'spent', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'color', 'then', ""'d"", 'be', 'ready', 'declare', 'masterpiece', 'level', 'John', 'Sturges', 'Love', 'Possessed', 'Douglas', 'Sirk', 'Magnificent', 'Obsession', 'black', 'white', 'New', 'Zealand', 'settings', 'look', 'tacky', 'cheap', 'perhaps', '1950s', 'people', 'ooohed', 'aahed', 'when', 'saw', 'Christchurch', 'screen', 'Wise', 'darting', 'camera', 'best', 'give', 'movie', 'sweep', 'motion', 'historical', 'epic', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'grandeur', 'way', 'hardly', 'what', 'human', 'emotions', 'roiling', 'screen', 'time', 'Piper', 'Laurie', 'up', 'sluttishly', 'tight', 'sweaters', 'eyes', 'glittering', 'sheaf', 'American', 'GI', 'wealth', 'chocolates', 'movie', 'off', 'own', 'sizzle', 'not', 'Piper', 'Laurie', 'great', 'actress', 'anything', 'Robert', 'Wise', 'signal', 'just', 'tear', 'up', 'narrative', 'bad', 'sister', 'Delia', 'Dee', 'call', 'times', 'kinder', 'reminiscence', 'never', 'know', 'what', 'last', 'name', 'give', 'name', 'man', 'most', 'money.This', 'one', 'homefront', 'movies', 'details', 'not', 'only', 'four', 'sisters', 'losing', 'man', 'had', 'husband', 'brother', 'boyfriend', 'father', 'gaining', 'replacements', 'back', 'steady', 'supply', 'new', 'American', 'blood', 'replace', 'own', '.depleted', 'Kiwi', 'energy', 'Cold', 'War', 'movie', 'many', 'ways', 'Sail', 'shows', 'American', 'army', 'fine', 'fettle', 'fighting', 'trim', 'guaranteed', 'win', 'war', 'frail', 'females', 'be', 'fair', 'show', 'foul', 'soldiers', 'fully', 'capable', 'Abu', 'Ghraib', 'style', 'atrocities', 'Ernest', 'Borgnine', 'character', 'From', 'Here', 'Eternity', 'multiplied', 'hundreds', 'good', 'men', 'too', 'Charles', 'Drake', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'men', 'needs', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'abuse', 'hospitality', 'Joan', 'Fontaine', 'lesson', 'best', 'extreme', 'arc', 'character', 'must', 'have', 'intrigued', 'flighty', 'sensitive', 'actress', 'still', 'hard', 'swallow', 'people', 'would', 'go', 'off', 'Nowhere', 'USA', 'based', 'grim', 'telegram', 'sensible', 'person', 'would', 'shudder', 'enough', 'spoilers', 'Suffice', 'say', 'Fontaine', 'Laurie', 'give', 'performances', 'equal', 'more', 'celebrated', 'roles', 'Jean', 'Simmons', 'Sandra', 'Dee', 'are', 'not', 'far', 'once', 'Jean', 'Simmons', 'playing', 'heroine', 'untrammeled', 'Freudian', 'traumas', 'Dee', 'weirdly', 'cast', 'young', 'girl', 'totally', 'devoted', 'opposite', 'sex', 'was', 'what', 'twelve', 'when', 'made', ""'d"", 'think', ""'d"", 'have', 'tried', 'cast', 'somebody', 'little', 'bit', 'older', 'perhaps', 'was', 'era', 'Lolita', 'Robert', 'Wise', 'was', 'dipping', 'toe', 'piquant', 'pellucid', 'water', 'potential']",N/A

Indeed the subject once more is the way people surrender their ideals and moral standards under the pressures of war... But here the emphasis is on women, and the story details the endless suffering and sacrifices of four sisters on the New Zealand Homefront during World War II...Newman, an American marine, becomes involved with one of the sisters (Jean Simmons), whose husband has recently been killed in combat... It's hardly a smooth relationship: Simmons doesn't trust the GIs, who exploit and abuse the local women; Newman, who has been, in his words, ""recently unmarried,"" has no faith in women or in romance... He is tough, unsociable, defensive, and trying to remain detached; and he uses his position as investigator of servicemen's prospective brides to advise men against marriage...This is the first of Newman's genuine alcoholics... When Simmons first meets him, he's in a bar, preoccupied with his liquor, and later, when she asks him how he copes with life, he shows her a bottle and delivers what would become characteristic Newman lines: ""This is what I spend the night with--and no regrets . . . And nobody gets hurt.""Gradually this confused and cynical man is unable to resist Simmons, who, he realizes, is the only woman he's ever really liked... He abandons what she calls his ""hot affair with the bottle,"" although they seem to avoid a sexual relationship... Some melodramatic events threaten to keep them apart, but all ends happily in a huge CinemaScope closeup embrace...Newman manages to mask his insecurities and neuroses... Instead of showing his usual aggressiveness with women, he becomes very dependent, seeing Simmons as almost a mother and letting her see his weaknesses... Most Newman characters are emotionally immature but they are rarely as open about it--rarely as overtly passive, dependent and adolescent...",3,Newman's move for the better...,1234310400,"02 11, 2009",2009,1956,"['film', 'Newman', 'military', 'officer', 'testifying', 'trial', 'one', 'Rack', 'Indeed', 'subject', 'once', 'more', 'way', 'people', 'surrender', 'ideals', 'moral', 'standards', 'pressures', 'war', 'here', 'emphasis', 'women', 'story', 'details', 'endless', 'suffering', 'sacrifices', 'four', 'sisters', 'New', 'Zealand', 'Homefront', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Newman', 'American', 'marine', 'involved', 'one', 'sisters', 'Jean', 'Simmons', 'husband', 'recently', 'been', 'killed', 'combat', 'hardly', 'smooth', 'relationship', 'Simmons', ""n't"", 'trust', 'GIs', 'who', 'exploit', 'abuse', 'local', 'women', 'Newman', 'who', 'been', 'words', 'recently', 'unmarried', 'faith', 'women', 'romance', 'tough', 'unsociable', 'defensive', 'trying', 'remain', 'detached', 'position', 'investigator', 'servicemen', 'prospective', 'brides', 'advise', 'men', 'marriage', 'first', 'Newman', 'genuine', 'alcoholics', 'When', 'Simmons', 'first', 'bar', 'preoccupied', 'liquor', 'later', 'when', 'how', 'life', 'bottle', 'delivers', 'what', 'would', 'become', 'characteristic', 'Newman', 'lines', 'what', 'spend', 'night', 'regrets', 'nobody', 'hurt', 'Gradually', 'confused', 'cynical', 'man', 'unable', 'resist', 'Simmons', 'who', 'only', 'woman', 'ever', 'really', 'liked', 'what', 'hot', 'affair', 'bottle', 'seem', 'avoid', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'melodramatic', 'events', 'threaten', 'keep', 'apart', 'happily', 'huge', 'CinemaScope', 'closeup', 'embrace', 'Newman', 'mask', 'insecurities', 'neuroses', 'Instead', 'showing', 'usual', 'aggressiveness', 'women', 'very', 'dependent', 'seeing', 'Simmons', 'almost', 'mother', 'letting', 'see', 'weaknesses', 'Most', 'Newman', 'characters', 'are', 'emotionally', 'immature', 'are', 'rarely', 'open', 'rarely', 'overtly', 'passive', 'dependent', 'adolescent']",N/A

The movie captures all aspects of wartime lonliness: youngest sister Evelyn's harmless puppy crushes, middle sister Dee's passionate sexual flings, big sister Anne's unexpected heartfelt first love, and Barbara's recovery as a young widow in the arms of ever-gorgeous Paul Newman.  But what makes this movie so worth watching isn't just the diversity of the stories but the ability to capture the raw emotions and truth felt by the characters.  In one poignant scene by a lake, Newman's character forwarns Simmons that he has no aspirations of love or marriage before surrendering himself to his lonliness.  It's one of the most passionate and desperate scenes I've ever seen.
