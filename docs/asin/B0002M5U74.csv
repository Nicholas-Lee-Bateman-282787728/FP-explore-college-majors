While the Muppets had the right mix of wit and charm to appeal to all ages, this was the sissified low-budget cousin with stupid costumes and even dumber characers, stories, songs, etc. Awful all the way around. Charlie the Owl, Freddie the Frog (perhaps my least favorite), and Henrietta Hippo as well as the pseudohippies Doug and Emmy Jo rammed lessons down kids throats without any wit or charm whatsoever and would only appeal to someone either under the age of three or with severely low IQs.A couin of mine recently bought this for my neice and on a lark, I sat and watched it. It was every bit as bad as I remembered and could not take ten minutes of it. Fourtunately, my eight-year old neice said, ""This is baby stuff."" I said, YOU GO GIRL, gave her a high-five, and put in some TRUE ""edutainment"" (Fat Albert) instead, which we BOTH enjoyed.Unlike the Muppets, Fat Albert, Schoolhouse Rock, and the wonderful ELECTRIC COMPANY that TRULY brought joy and learning to all ages in the early 70s, this was pretty much a predecessor to the nauseating, sissy antics of Barney the Dinosaur and other saccharine quiche-eating efforts that would cause the next generation of children to hold on to their stomachs in AGONY. If you can sit all the way through this, a get well card is in order.But hey, the DVD would make a great frisbee or it could be used for target practice.",1,The WORST!!!

Does this bias my opinion of the New Zoo Review? Maybe, but since I know Doug and his background and committment to children, I know how the New Zoo Review works with children. Doug's talent extended from acting, directing, writing and music/lyrics. The New Zoo Review is Doug's crowning achievment.

Good for pre-schoolers and anyone who remembers it from their childhood. Now for the pros and consPros: This show was not released in traditional seasons. It was syndicated in 1972 and again in 1977. I beleve the first runs shows are the best, and all 59 are here. The video quailty is good, some video noise that is on the master tape but generally good. The shows are complete at 22.5 minutes each, and only 5 per disc so they are not over compressed. It's packaged nicely, and overall BCI has done an excellent job with this releae.Cons: The Box Set is on 6 Double Sided dics, they all play fine but we all know the issues with DVD 18.
