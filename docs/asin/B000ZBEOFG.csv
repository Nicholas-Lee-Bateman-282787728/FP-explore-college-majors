1121705,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B000ZBEOFG,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[0, 0]","CROCI have reviewed some of the Maneater Series before and have liked all of them thus far. Here we have a film about a crocodile obviously who is on the loose in Thailand chomping people up. So that always makes for a good time in any creature feature or nature run a muck flick. I thought this was your average SyFy channel flick and in that it is was ok. Michael Madsen is always cool even though it seems like he plays every character the same, still he is cool.Jack McQuade owns a Croc farm in the town this takes place in and is very good at his job. Still the Konsong brothers who are the farms neighbor's want him gone for their own reasons. In wanting that they release his crocs all the time and call in complaints about him and his farm. Those of course are the little problems in this town, because a killer croc is on the loose. Said croc is about 20ft long, maybe longer, and he is ready to eat any and all that are in the water.The movie of course is a low budget flick produced for the SyFy channel so you know special effects are top notch. Mixing in shots of real crocs and some cg shots it may be a little bit of a let down. Speaking of that the script could have really used some work because at times it feels like this is two films blended into one. If you check this out I am sure you will see what I am talking about. As for acting it is not all that great and that mainly is the dubbing's fault here. Some times it is spot on and others it seems like the voice does not match the body.Still this movie gets some props for being entertaining and having one of the funniest scenes ever. Now if you don't want a spoiler turn away here, and also don't think I am some evil guy for laughing at this. There is a scene where some rich people are out in the water on their boat and their kids hop in the water. Right after this the police ride up and say ""get your kids out of the water, there is a croc loose"". Now that is not funny I know but after that all the kids hop on at the urging of their mother except one. Now this kid is snotty and refuses even though his parents are telling him to get on the boat. Then his dad says ""fine stay in the water, let the croc get him"", less then a second later an awesome looking cg shot happens were the croc comes up and takes the whole kid in his mouth right in front of them. I laughed so hard it was scary and even watched it a couple more times.I can't help it but that was so funny because that kid had it coming, now I say that for a movie. In real life I never would like such a thing of course I am no monster, but sense this was so obviously fake I could get into it. Any way Michael Madsen is very Michael Madsen here and he is great as the croc hunter that comes in. In fact when every one goes out looking for the croc the film gets better. And there is a good scene that involves the Konsong brothers at their pool, loved it. Over all this is your typical SyFy flick so if you are into those check it out, not the best of the Maneater series but still.",3,KILLER CROC,1318550400,"10 14, 2011",2011,3027,"['CROCI', 'have', 'reviewed', 'Maneater', 'Series', 'have', 'liked', 'thus', 'far', 'Here', 'have', 'film', 'crocodile', 'obviously', 'who', 'loose', 'Thailand', 'chomping', 'people', 'up', 'always', 'good', 'time', 'creature', 'feature', 'nature', 'run', 'muck', 'flick', 'thought', 'was', 'average', 'SyFy', 'channel', 'flick', 'was', 'ok.', 'Michael', 'Madsen', 'always', 'cool', 'even', 'character', 'same', 'still', 'cool.Jack', 'McQuade', 'Croc', 'farm', 'town', 'place', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'Still', 'Konsong', 'brothers', 'who', 'are', 'farms', 'neighbor', 'want', 'gone', 'own', 'reasons', 'wanting', 'release', 'crocs', 'time', 'call', 'complaints', 'farm', 'course', 'are', 'little', 'problems', 'town', 'killer', 'croc', 'loose', 'Said', 'croc', '20ft', 'long', 'maybe', 'longer', 'ready', 'eat', 'are', 'water.The', 'movie', 'course', 'low', 'budget', 'flick', 'produced', 'SyFy', 'channel', 'so', 'know', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'Mixing', 'shots', 'real', 'crocs', 'cg', 'shots', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'bit', 'let', 'down', 'Speaking', 'script', 'could', 'have', 'really', 'used', 'work', 'because', 'times', 'two', 'films', 'blended', 'one', 'check', 'out', 'am', 'sure', 'will', 'see', 'what', 'am', 'talking', 'about', 'acting', 'not', 'great', 'mainly', 'dubbing', 'fault', 'here', 'times', 'spot', 'others', 'voice', 'not', 'match', 'body.Still', 'movie', 'props', 'being', 'entertaining', 'having', 'one', 'funniest', 'scenes', 'ever', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoiler', 'turn', 'away', 'here', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'am', 'evil', 'guy', 'laughing', 'scene', 'where', 'rich', 'people', 'are', 'out', 'water', 'boat', 'kids', 'hop', 'water', 'Right', 'police', 'ride', 'say', 'get', 'kids', 'water', 'croc', 'loose', 'Now', 'not', 'funny', 'know', 'kids', 'hop', 'urging', 'mother', 'one', 'Now', 'kid', 'snotty', 'even', 'parents', 'are', 'telling', 'get', 'boat', 'Then', 'dad', 'fine', 'stay', 'water', 'let', 'croc', 'get', 'less', 'then', 'second', 'later', 'awesome', 'looking', 'cg', 'shot', 'happens', 'were', 'croc', 'up', 'whole', 'kid', 'mouth', 'right', 'front', 'laughed', 'so', 'hard', 'was', 'scary', 'even', 'watched', 'couple', 'more', 'times.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'was', 'so', 'funny', 'kid', 'had', 'coming', 'now', 'say', 'movie', 'real', 'life', 'never', 'would', 'like', 'such', 'thing', 'course', 'am', 'monster', 'sense', 'was', 'so', 'obviously', 'fake', 'could', 'get', 'way', 'Michael', 'Madsen', 'very', 'Michael', 'Madsen', 'here', 'great', 'croc', 'hunter', 'fact', 'when', 'one', 'out', 'looking', 'croc', 'film', 'better', 'good', 'scene', 'Konsong', 'brothers', 'pool', 'loved', 'typical', 'SyFy', 'flick', 'so', 'are', 'check', 'out', 'not', 'best', 'Maneater', 'series', 'still']",Croc

The exotic locale of Thailand, including some actors and actresses, help to enliven this outing and, quite surprisingly, Michael Madsen helps to ground the movie and give it some empathy.  As the story goes an American runs a rundown croc zoo with live demonstrations but is having trouble paying the rent.  That's convenient as some local land developer/ gangsters want him out of the way and keep sabotaging his zoo and making trouble for him with an animal rights overseer (somehow I don't picture Thailand as having those...).  It doesn't help matters when a large, rogue croc kills some locals after some of the American's crocs have been let loose.  So he gets involved in trying to save his crocs only to find that there is an actual large predatory crocodile terrorizing the area and he ends teaming up with the attractive female animal rights overseer and Michael Madsen, a hunter who has been on the trail of this particular killer for years.  The end of the movie is a nice showdown between these (and a couple of other people) leads and the titular man-eating monster.  A nice effort and a decent watch, especially if you're in the mood.Note: the review above is for the stadalone movie ""Croc"".  Amazon's review process apparently will not let us create a separate review for the triple feature of the ""Maneater"" series that also contains ""Sea Beast"" and ""Shark Swarm"".  For my reviews of those standalone movies please go to those movies as sold as solo features.  My overall review for the three film set is that ""Sea Beast"" rates 4 stars, ""Croc"" 3 to 3.5, and Shark Swarm an abyssmal 1 star--avoid that at all costs.  On the cheap the triple feature is worth purchasing because of the better than average ""Sea Beast"" and ""Croc"" and I would grade the overall experience (""Shark Swarm"" included) 3 stars.",3,This crocodile had a taste for some Thai food!,1346544000,"09 2, 2012",2012,1958,"['are', 'decent', 'moments', 'even', 'moments', 'suspense', 'rogue', 'crocodile', 'movie', 'speaking', 'Rogue', 'make', 'sure', 'see', 'movie', 'exotic', 'locale', 'Thailand', 'including', 'actors', 'actresses', 'help', 'enliven', 'outing', 'quite', 'surprisingly', 'Michael', 'Madsen', 'ground', 'movie', 'give', 'empathy', 'story', 'American', 'rundown', 'croc', 'zoo', 'live', 'demonstrations', 'having', 'trouble', 'paying', 'rent', 'convenient', 'local', 'land', 'developer/', 'gangsters', 'want', 'way', 'keep', 'sabotaging', 'zoo', 'making', 'trouble', 'animal', 'rights', 'overseer', 'somehow', 'do', ""n't"", 'picture', 'Thailand', 'having', ""n't"", 'help', 'matters', 'when', 'large', 'rogue', 'croc', 'locals', 'American', 'crocs', 'have', 'been', 'let', 'loose', 'involved', 'trying', 'save', 'crocs', 'only', 'find', 'actual', 'large', 'predatory', 'crocodile', 'terrorizing', 'area', 'teaming', 'up', 'attractive', 'female', 'animal', 'rights', 'overseer', 'Michael', 'Madsen', 'hunter', 'who', 'been', 'trail', 'particular', 'killer', 'years', 'end', 'movie', 'nice', 'showdown', 'couple', 'other', 'people', 'titular', 'man-eating', 'monster', 'nice', 'effort', 'decent', 'watch', 'especially', ""'re"", 'mood.Note', 'review', 'stadalone', 'movie', 'Croc', 'Amazon', 'review', 'process', 'apparently', 'will', 'not', 'let', 'create', 'separate', 'review', 'triple', 'feature', 'Maneater', 'series', 'also', 'Sea', 'Beast', 'Shark', 'Swarm', 'reviews', 'standalone', 'movies', 'please', 'go', 'movies', 'as', 'sold', 'solo', 'features', 'overall', 'review', 'three', 'film', 'set', 'Sea', 'Beast', 'rates', '4', 'stars', 'Croc', '3', '3.5', 'Shark', 'Swarm', 'abyssmal', '1', 'star', 'avoid', 'costs', 'cheap', 'triple', 'feature', 'worth', 'purchasing', 'better', 'average', 'Sea', 'Beast', 'Croc', 'would', 'grade', 'overall', 'experience', 'Shark', 'Swarm', 'included', '3', 'stars']",Croc

1121721,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B000ZBEOFG,trebe,"[6, 6]","Filmed in Thailand and part of the Maneater series, Croc (2007) as you might expect, is about a large crocodile that is chomping on the local population.  While not particularly well-written, and with spotty often laughable special effects, what probably helps bolster the film are some of the exotic locations, and the cast of mostly unknown, but earnest local actors.  Being from another culture, and having limited acting experience, the cast have a certain innocence and freshness.  Michael Madsen (Species) is the only name star, playing Hawkins, an experienced croc hunter.  Until he appears at about the halfway point, the film is carried almost entirely by the local talent.Jack McQuade (Peter Tuinstra) the owner of Jack's Croc Farm, has some major problems.  The Konsong brothers, rich influential businessmen, are trying to shut down his business.  And Evelyn Namwong (Sherry Phungprasert), an agent from animal welfare is also on his case.  Fortunately Jack has his nephew Theo (Scott Hazel) to help him with the business, and his sister Allison (Elizabeth Healey) for financial backing.After Konsong's thugs break into the farm and release some of the crocodiles, Jack's animals are temporarily suspected of being responsible, after human remains are discovered in the ocean.  When the killer croc strikes again, grabbing a small boy, it is clear that another much larger animal is to blame.  After being fired, Evelyn teams up with Jack, who is hunting the croc.  After meeting Hawkins in the jungle, they form one big happy team.Croc is full of ridiculous moments, probably none more so than when the killer croc invades a swimming pool.  Some of the attack scenes are quite effective, including one where the young boy is swallowed whole by the beast.  A fake croc is effectively employed in some of the attacks, but the budget apparently ran low in other areas.  Often the suitable footage to make scenes with the croc look passable apparently was not available.  Instead the filmmakers try, mostly unsuccessfully, to get by with cheap tricks, stock footage, and fast editing.  After a while, these visual shortcomings become a joke.While the special effects are not always up to snuff, and the acting isn't vey polished, Croc does have some entertaining moments.  Perhaps not enough to recommend as a buy, but if you are a fan of the Maneater series, the film is certainly worth looking for on the Sy Fy schedule.",3,"very uneven special effects, but kind of a nice change of pace . . .",1282867200,"08 27, 2010",2010,2431,"['Filmed', 'Thailand', 'part', 'Maneater', 'series', 'Croc', '2007', 'might', 'expect', 'large', 'crocodile', 'chomping', 'local', 'population', 'not', 'particularly', 'well-written', 'spotty', 'often', 'laughable', 'special', 'effects', 'what', 'probably', 'bolster', 'film', 'are', 'exotic', 'locations', 'cast', 'mostly', 'unknown', 'earnest', 'local', 'actors', 'Being', 'culture', 'having', 'limited', 'acting', 'experience', 'cast', 'have', 'certain', 'innocence', 'freshness', 'Michael', 'Madsen', 'Species', 'only', 'name', 'star', 'playing', 'Hawkins', 'experienced', 'croc', 'hunter', 'halfway', 'point', 'film', 'carried', 'almost', 'entirely', 'local', 'talent.Jack', 'McQuade', 'Peter', 'Tuinstra', 'owner', 'Jack', 'Croc', 'Farm', 'major', 'problems', 'Konsong', 'brothers', 'rich', 'influential', 'businessmen', 'are', 'trying', 'shut', 'down', 'business', 'Evelyn', 'Namwong', 'Sherry', 'Phungprasert', 'agent', 'animal', 'welfare', 'also', 'case', 'Fortunately', 'Jack', 'nephew', 'Theo', 'Scott', 'Hazel', 'help', 'business', 'sister', 'Allison', 'Elizabeth', 'Healey', 'financial', 'backing.After', 'Konsong', 'thugs', 'break', 'farm', 'release', 'crocodiles', 'Jack', 'animals', 'are', 'temporarily', 'suspected', 'being', 'responsible', 'human', 'remains', 'are', 'discovered', 'ocean', 'When', 'killer', 'croc', 'strikes', 'again', 'grabbing', 'small', 'boy', 'clear', 'much', 'larger', 'animal', 'blame', 'being', 'fired', 'Evelyn', 'up', 'Jack', 'who', 'hunting', 'croc', 'meeting', 'Hawkins', 'jungle', 'form', 'one', 'big', 'happy', 'team.Croc', 'full', 'ridiculous', 'moments', 'probably', 'none', 'more', 'so', 'when', 'killer', 'croc', 'swimming', 'pool', 'attack', 'scenes', 'are', 'quite', 'effective', 'including', 'one', 'where', 'young', 'boy', 'swallowed', 'whole', 'beast', 'fake', 'croc', 'effectively', 'employed', 'attacks', 'budget', 'apparently', 'ran', 'low', 'other', 'areas', 'Often', 'suitable', 'footage', 'make', 'scenes', 'croc', 'look', 'passable', 'apparently', 'was', 'not', 'available', 'Instead', 'filmmakers', 'try', 'mostly', 'unsuccessfully', 'get', 'cheap', 'tricks', 'stock', 'footage', 'fast', 'editing', 'while', 'visual', 'shortcomings', 'become', 'joke.While', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'snuff', 'acting', ""n't"", 'vey', 'polished', 'Croc', 'have', 'entertaining', 'moments', 'Perhaps', 'not', 'enough', 'recommend', 'buy', 'are', 'fan', 'Maneater', 'series', 'film', 'certainly', 'worth', 'looking', 'Sy', 'Fy', 'schedule']",Croc
