This film doesn't have a happy Hollywood ending but, perhaps, it also doesn't have an entirely depressing ending either.

1261770,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B002C39SQK,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 3]","I have a theory.  It goes like this: after making beautifully styled and impactful films like `Pride and Prejudice' and `Atonement', Joseph Wright was distraught.  He was cruelly snubbed a directing Oscar nomination in 2007 and decided that he needed to find his footing with some more straightforward Oscar fare, and what is more Oscary than people suffering from disabilities, so he decided to make `The Soloist', a film that has nothing in common with his previous offerings outside of some nice lighting.Is this serious?I have no qualms with films about disabilities and overcoming them and unlikely friendships that shape the course of our futures, but `The Soloist' is so poorly constructed that it becomes a complete burden of a film.  Laced with a backstory that never feels completed and a conclusion that feels so out of place I found myself wondering why there was so much buildup for this, I can't help but consider what this film could have been and wonder entirely with Wright decided he wanted to make this.  His filmography, this sore spot excluded, is rather impeccable, and he brings so much of himself to each offering, but this just felt like a lazy attempt at generating Oscar buzz.  If failed, for the film was semi-panned by critics and nothing became of it.I'm growing increasingly tired of Robert Downey Jr.'s lazy attempt as a comeback.  He had so much promise as a young actor, squandered it and then came back on the screen, winning over the world by regurgitating an image of his own persona on every character he portrays.  He needs to stop playing himself over and over again.  Jamie Foxx is hilarious here.  Wait, that wasn't the intent.  Whoops.  Maybe it was the generalized way his disease is highlighted or the campy way his antics are portrayed, but seriously he was a hot mess.The film's core themes are never really explored in the way that they should have been.  The growing issue of homelessness and mental illness are areas that should be explored, but this messy concoction does it no justice and offers no true spotlight on any source or solution.Thank Wright came to his senses after this debacle.",1,Is this serious?,1374451200,"07 22, 2013",2013,2143,"['have', 'theory', 'making', 'beautifully', 'styled', 'impactful', 'films', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'Atonement', 'Joseph', 'Wright', 'was', 'distraught', 'was', 'cruelly', 'snubbed', 'directing', 'Oscar', 'nomination', '2007', 'decided', 'needed', 'find', 'footing', 'more', 'straightforward', 'Oscar', 'fare', 'what', 'more', 'Oscary', 'people', 'suffering', 'disabilities', 'decided', 'make', 'Soloist', 'film', 'nothing', 'common', 'previous', 'offerings', 'nice', 'lighting.Is', 'serious', 'have', 'qualms', 'films', 'disabilities', 'overcoming', 'unlikely', 'friendships', 'shape', 'course', 'futures', 'Soloist', 'so', 'poorly', 'constructed', 'complete', 'burden', 'film', 'Laced', 'backstory', 'never', 'completed', 'conclusion', 'so', 'place', 'found', 'wondering', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'buildup', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'consider', 'what', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'wonder', 'entirely', 'Wright', 'decided', 'wanted', 'make', 'filmography', 'sore', 'spot', 'excluded', 'rather', 'impeccable', 'so', 'much', 'offering', 'just', 'felt', 'lazy', 'attempt', 'generating', 'Oscar', 'buzz', 'failed', 'film', 'was', 'semi-panned', 'critics', 'nothing', 'became', 'it.I', ""'m"", 'growing', 'increasingly', 'tired', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'lazy', 'attempt', 'comeback', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'promise', 'young', 'actor', 'squandered', 'then', 'came', 'back', 'screen', 'winning', 'world', 'regurgitating', 'image', 'own', 'persona', 'character', 'stop', 'playing', 'over', 'again', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'hilarious', 'here', 'Wait', 'was', ""n't"", 'intent', 'Whoops', 'Maybe', 'was', 'generalized', 'way', 'disease', 'highlighted', 'campy', 'way', 'antics', 'are', 'portrayed', 'seriously', 'was', 'hot', 'mess.The', 'film', 'core', 'themes', 'are', 'never', 'really', 'explored', 'way', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'growing', 'issue', 'homelessness', 'mental', 'illness', 'are', 'areas', 'should', 'be', 'explored', 'messy', 'concoction', 'justice', 'true', 'spotlight', 'source', 'solution.Thank', 'Wright', 'came', 'senses', 'debacle']",N/A

I understand there's only so much of a detailed book that you can fit into a two-hour movie but screenwriter Susannah Grant drop-kicked this one.  Is this even the same story?One example:  in the book, Lopez studiously learns about homelessness, asks about resources, finds out about LA's Lamp Community, educates himself on that, ascertains Ayers' history as it pertains to Lamp, discusses an arrangement whereby he might leave a cello at Lamp for Ayers to play, and works a deal with Lamp where Ayers can only play the cello on the premises.  Mr. Lopez goes on about this for quite a number of pages.  And, frankly, that's the beauty of the book:  Lopez is a journalist.  He painstakingly chases down leads.  He reports on them in exquisite detail.  We see exactly how all that plays out.In the movie version of that: Lopez - apropos of nothing - says something to the effect of ""if you want to play this, you need to do it at Lamp."" Huh?  That's its first mention.  So much for Lopez's painstaking research, efforts and string-pulling to get to that point.Lopez's book is about Ayers and homelessness.  What Lopez's book was not about:  Steve Lopez.  So why have Grant and director Joe Wright invent this fake family life for the faux Lopez?  It mars an excellent story.  Yes, DreamWorks and Universal did their best to sink this picture by pulling a very late switch in release dates, all but consigning it to the Bomb Squad.

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[8, 8]","If there were ever any doubt that Robert Downey Jr. is one of our best current actors out there, then this film should put them to rest. Still having doubts? Check out his more current resume:Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang,Good Night and Good Luck,Iron Man, and his amazingTropic Thunder. And these are just a select few that I've cherry picked. This isn't to say that Jamie Foxx (Dreamgirls) didn't do a great job. It's just that Downey Jr. is showing up in some awfully great roles and performing them to perfection, as witnessed here in THE SOLOIST.This is a story close to my heart. Similar in theme toLars and the Real Girl, this story doesn't circle around a town coming together to help one man's pysche. This story is about two men who orbit in entirely different galaxies and how a passing swipe ends up creating a lifetime friendship. Yes, there's the mental illness aspect to it and Foxx plays the role of Nathaniel Ayers exceptionally well. His schizophrenia is obvious, and living on the streets hasn't helped. And when newspaper reporter Steve Lopez (Downey Jr.) tries finding a story to write about, he stumbles upon Nathaniel's past as a Juilliard Music School drop-out. Nathaniel plays a violin with only two strings, and as Steve Lopez writes about his newfound friend in the paper, a donation comes floating in: a beautiful cello.This cello has multiple draws for Nathaniel, and some of them aren't good. The positives are that Nathaniel can play a beautiful instrument beautifully. And that he finally starts forming a friendly tie with someone (anyone!) It just happens to be Steve Lopez. Steve starts showing him around the current musical scene. But with Nathaniel's reawakening comes the remembrance of his past and how he got to where he is. His mental breakdown comes crashing back into current memory, even as Steve, his new friend, tries to help him out more and more.The side-story of Steve and his wife's reconciliation (Catherine Keener,An American Crime) is pretty much fluff for the movie/story and doesn't add much. It is the touching and powerful story of a friendship forming amidst a respect for one another, a love of music, and facing the challenges of an oft-times debilitating mental illness that drives this wonderful film.And the music ain't too shabby either.",4,Steve And The Real Man,1253491200,"09 21, 2009",2009,2293,"['were', 'ever', 'doubt', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'one', 'best', 'current', 'actors', 'there', 'then', 'film', 'should', 'put', 'rest', 'Still', 'having', 'doubts', 'Check', 'more', 'current', 'resume', 'Kiss', 'Kiss', 'Bang', 'Bang', 'Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'Iron', 'Man', 'amazingTropic', 'Thunder', 'are', 'just', 'select', 'few', ""'ve"", 'cherry', 'picked', ""n't"", 'say', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'Dreamgirls', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'great', 'job', 'just', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'showing', 'up', 'awfully', 'great', 'roles', 'performing', 'perfection', 'witnessed', 'here', 'THE', 'SOLOIST.This', 'story', 'close', 'heart', 'Similar', 'theme', 'toLars', 'Real', 'Girl', 'story', ""n't"", 'circle', 'around', 'town', 'coming', 'together', 'help', 'one', 'man', 'pysche', 'story', 'two', 'men', 'who', 'orbit', 'entirely', 'different', 'galaxies', 'how', 'passing', 'swipe', 'up', 'creating', 'lifetime', 'friendship', 'Yes', 'mental', 'illness', 'aspect', 'Foxx', 'role', 'Nathaniel', 'Ayers', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'schizophrenia', 'obvious', 'living', 'streets', ""n't"", 'helped', 'when', 'newspaper', 'reporter', 'Steve', 'Lopez', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'finding', 'story', 'write', 'about', 'Nathaniel', 'past', 'Juilliard', 'Music', 'School', 'drop-out', 'Nathaniel', 'violin', 'only', 'two', 'strings', 'Steve', 'Lopez', 'newfound', 'friend', 'paper', 'donation', 'floating', 'beautiful', 'cello.This', 'cello', 'multiple', 'draws', 'Nathaniel', 'are', ""n't"", 'good', 'positives', 'are', 'Nathaniel', 'can', 'play', 'beautiful', 'instrument', 'beautifully', 'finally', 'forming', 'friendly', 'tie', 'someone', 'anyone', 'just', 'be', 'Steve', 'Lopez', 'Steve', 'showing', 'current', 'musical', 'scene', 'Nathaniel', 'reawakening', 'remembrance', 'past', 'how', 'got', 'where', 'mental', 'breakdown', 'crashing', 'back', 'current', 'memory', 'even', 'Steve', 'new', 'friend', 'help', 'out', 'more', 'more.The', 'side-story', 'Steve', 'wife', 'reconciliation', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'American', 'Crime', 'pretty', 'much', 'fluff', 'movie/story', ""n't"", 'add', 'much', 'touching', 'powerful', 'story', 'friendship', 'forming', 'amidst', 'respect', 'one', 'love', 'music', 'facing', 'challenges', 'oft-times', 'debilitating', 'mental', 'illness', 'wonderful', 'music', 'ai', ""n't"", 'too', 'shabby', 'either']",N/A

This movie is based on the true accounts of LA journalist Steve Lopez.While searching for his next story, Lopez, played by Robert Downey Jr., stumbles across a Julliard trained musician who is also homeless and suffers from mental illness. The Soloist took me on a journey that I was unprepared to take, though I feel I am better for having taken it. This movie was moving and poignant. The Soloist allows you to take a hard-nosed look at homelessness and mental illness in America, and at the importance of friendships in our lives. More pointedly, The Soloist allows you to reassess your views on all three.I highly recommend this movie but, be prepared to be positively touched on an emotional and mental level.

Lopez, sensing a story, takes Ayers under his wing, only to become the one friend Ayers has.Sounds like a horrible sappy story, right?  It could've been.  Hell, it still is, in a way; at points, THE SOLOIST falls significantly flat (yes, the pun is intended).  But at other points it soars.  True, a lot of this belongs to director Joe Wright, who turns this film into a minor epic, thanks in large part to the Beethoven soundtrack (and there are a few scenes that will steal your breath away, almost-perfect combinations of music and imagery).  But the true heart of the movie lies in the acting.  Jaime Foxx should have been the star here; he's nuanced and physical, a real presence on the screen.  But it's Robert Downey Jr. who walks away with the lead-actor credit.  This is Downey's film: he gets to display all of his trademark bits (his wit, his facial expressions, his emotional range) and even goes a couple steps farther.  It's not his greatest performance, but it's up there, enough to steal the film from (arguably) the most interesting character.THE SOLOIST isn't for everybody.  It's slow, plodding in spots, and the plot is (let's admit it) uninspired, even if it is based on a true story.  Nor does it really have much to say about the homeless, though it tries (this attempt at a social message leads to a flat ending, though it's counter-balanced by the fact that Wright used a lot of real homeless people as extras).  Still, despite all its flaws, THE SOLOIST is a definite Oscar-contender, thanks to its two main actors.

1261780,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B002C39SQK,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[7, 8]","The sum of the parts of this DVD are way better than the whole. I certainly enjoyed The Soloist, it is a good movie. But once I began exploring the bonus features on this DVD, the whole became so much more. This is the first time since watching Criterion LaserDiscs with real live director or film historian commentary, have bonus features been this movie enhancing.The Soloist is a solid movie about a Los Angeles Times journalist that meets a homeless man playing a two stringed violin. The film follows Steve Lopez (Robert Downey Jr.), the journalist, through his emotions trying to help Nathaniel Anthony Ayers (Jamie Foxx). The two men end up developing a deep friendship. Gratefully the screenwriter chose not to make this a happily ever after film. The nearly 2 hour film explores insanity, homelessness, and how well meaning people may or may not help these people.Where things just go crazy wonderful is in the deep bonus features. The film opens with a very strange plea by a very odd looking person - almost priest-like, 'if you see a homeless person, they probably don't want money, they really want to just have you say hello. To get more involved with helping see this website.' Its a strange message, delivered by a strange person, and very confusing for the first time viewer. Jumping into the bonus features, it turns out this is the real live Steve Lopez.The Bonus Features:Beth's Story - a powerful 1.5 minute animated film about a girl who's parents die, she moves from foster home to foster home, finally lives on her own, gets sick, can't pay her bills, and becomes homeless - I cried.A Making of Featurette like none I've ever seen. Not only did this film portray a side of life I hope I never see, nor you see; but they put their money where their mouth is - they hired the homeless to actually perform in this film.A video about the real live Nathaniel Anthony Ayers, Steve Lopez, and his sister. Done with heart and tenderness. It is a beautiful interview piece.A series of deleted scenes that frankly are hard to tell why they were left out. Several fill plot holes that I found a little disconcerting during the film.All total there is roughly 45 minutes of bonus features. They give context to how this film was made and why.I had a few problems with the film itself (they were quickly tossed away after seeing the bonus features). On first view, the Lamp and Mission areas just seemed all too Hollywood. They were packed with homeless people, too much seemed to be going on, they almost looked polished or unreal. As with most true stories, truth is way stranger than fiction. Apparently this is reality on this street, it was not over done. There were some minor pacing problems, early on the story kind of stalled here and there. And I went from thinking that Steve Lopez was this awesome fantastic person, to what his ex-wife says at one point - he is just capitalizing on somebody else's misfortune. The worst moment of this was when Nathaniel calls Mr. Lopez asking for help; but he is too busy receiving an award for his LA Times articles about Nathaniel Ayers.The acting is superb in this film. Jamie Foxx is just outstanding, he proved his acting ability in Ray (that he isn't just a clown like in Booty Call), and just builds in this film. After seeing the real Nathaniel Ayers - Mr. Foxx nailed the performance. Robert Downey Jr. is such a talented actor, to say Iron Man, Tropic Thunder, and this film in one breath is some amazing credit to his abilities. He actually improved on the real Mr. Lopez. By far my favorite actor in this film is Nelsan Ellis who played David the director or advocate at Lamp/The Mission.The film alone is more like a 4 star film. John Wright basically has three films to his credit, The Soloist, Atonement, and Pride and Prejudice. The latter two are not great but good films. The downside to this lack of experience is a number of scenes that run too long and others that run too short - or leave plot holes. Frankly I would have traded some scenes off to include three of the deleted scenes - when viewed they fill plot holes and the film makes much more sense. Camera work is overall very good. Steady shots are good and solid, handheld is kept to a minimum. I noticed a few jarring cuts from solid shots to handhelds that didn't make good sense. The use of boom shots and huge sweeping pans was a bit over the top most of the time. Near the end there are one shots between Mr. Lopez and Ayers - framing is used to great advantage, placing Mr. Lopez on the weak side and Mr. Ayers on the strong side of the frame. A powerful subtle technique.The film is rated PG-13. There is a bit of strong language, but mostly it is held to a minimum. The subject matter is tough, insanity, and homelessness its probably not fare for those younger than 13. There was a scene or two where my 13 year old son felt a little bit nervous - the voices that Mr. Ayers hears in his head are rendered a bit too real at times. The whole production company was very wise to achieve a PG-13 rating. First and foremost this film could reach the widest audience. I don't feel like they compromised anything by keeping the language in reign.I've always had a fear of homelessness. This film struck a very strong chord for me. It helped me see that there are small things that everyone can do, that can make a difference.

1261781,A2Q42ON9CEHR4O,B002C39SQK,David R. Eastwood,"[6, 8]","Yes, this film IS a piece of propaganda. (Let us be clear: there is good propaganda, bad propaganda, and all sorts in between.) This film's heart is in the right place, but it is only partly effective in conveying its message that homeless people ought to be helped. In fact, the bonus features actually do far more towards this end than the film itself does.Based on fact, this is a portrayal of LA TIMES newsman Steve Lopez (Robert Downey, Jr.) meeting a homeless musician, Nathaniel Ayers (Jamie Foxx), by chance and getting to know him and his plight while writing a series of articles about him. During the course of their relationship, it becomes increasingly clear that Ayers is mentally ill and not able to improve his own condition by himself.Downey, as usual, does a fine job of acting, and for the most part so does Foxx, who in real life does play piano. What I repeatedly found distracting was the bogus way Foxx ""played"" a cello: although he had been given a crash course in fingering and bowing (with the bow muted with soap), he was not given any coaching in vibrato playing, which even young children learn in early lessons when they take up string instruments.The script is partly to blame, too: it seems to be wandering around in search of ""meaning"" and only belatedly finds it. In that, it would be following in the footsteps of Mr. Lopez, the newsman, who did not know at the beginning of his relationship with Mr. Ayers ""where it was going""--nor even in the middle of that relationship (in common with all of us who are living and interacting with others). And yet, even if the ""characters"" are in the dark about the pattern of their lives, an ""author"" ought to be in control of her/his characters and know where it is all going to ""end."" And that is true even when a story does not ""end"" in the sense of stopping, for in this film the audience is deliberately left with the sense that ""things have been made 'somewhat better' but will never be completely fixed and will continue to require somebody's help to maintain that condition of being 'somewhat better'.""Sadly, this film will probably do little to change the minds and hearts of most Americans as far as the real needs of homeless people are concerned. We are too polarized as a society. Those who are already of a mind to help, will continue doing so; those who are not, will continue in that path. No propaganda is foolproof. The same basic message to help our fellow human beings was put forth in the fifth century B.C. by Buddha, in first century A.D. by Christ (see for example Matt. 25, the parable of Judgment: ""I was hungry and you gave me no food"" etc.), and in the 19th century by Charles Dickens in A CHRISTMAS CAROL, Herman Melville in ""Bartleby the Scrivener,"" and Leo Tolstoy in ""The Death of Ivan Ilych."" Clearly these world-class examples of good propaganda have often had little effect on the majority of people either.",3,"THIS FILM'S HEART IS IN THE RIGHT PLACE, BUT----",1253404800,"09 20, 2009",2009,2916,"['Yes', 'film', 'piece', 'propaganda', 'Let', 'be', 'clear', 'good', 'propaganda', 'bad', 'propaganda', 'sorts', 'film', 'heart', 'right', 'place', 'only', 'partly', 'effective', 'conveying', 'message', 'homeless', 'people', 'ought', 'be', 'helped', 'fact', 'bonus', 'features', 'actually', 'do', 'far', 'more', 'towards', 'end', 'film', 'does.Based', 'fact', 'portrayal', 'LA', 'TIMES', 'newsman', 'Steve', 'Lopez', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'meeting', 'homeless', 'musician', 'Nathaniel', 'Ayers', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'chance', 'getting', 'know', 'plight', 'writing', 'series', 'articles', 'course', 'relationship', 'increasingly', 'clear', 'Ayers', 'mentally', 'ill', 'not', 'able', 'improve', 'own', 'condition', 'himself.Downey', 'usual', 'fine', 'job', 'acting', 'most', 'part', 'so', 'Foxx', 'who', 'real', 'life', 'play', 'piano', 'What', 'repeatedly', 'found', 'distracting', 'was', 'bogus', 'way', 'Foxx', 'played', 'cello', 'had', 'been', 'given', 'crash', 'course', 'fingering', 'bowing', 'bow', 'muted', 'soap', 'was', 'not', 'given', 'coaching', 'vibrato', 'playing', 'even', 'young', 'children', 'learn', 'early', 'lessons', 'when', 'take', 'up', 'string', 'instruments.The', 'script', 'partly', 'blame', 'too', 'be', 'wandering', 'search', 'meaning', 'only', 'belatedly', 'would', 'be', 'following', 'footsteps', 'Mr.', 'Lopez', 'newsman', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'beginning', 'relationship', 'Mr.', 'Ayers', 'where', 'was', 'going', 'even', 'middle', 'relationship', 'common', 'who', 'are', 'living', 'interacting', 'others', 'yet', 'even', 'characters', 'are', 'dark', 'pattern', 'lives', 'author', 'ought', 'be', 'control', 'her/his', 'characters', 'know', 'where', 'going', 'end', 'true', 'even', 'when', 'story', 'not', 'end', 'sense', 'stopping', 'film', 'audience', 'deliberately', 'left', 'sense', 'things', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'better', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'completely', 'fixed', 'will', 'continue', 'require', 'somebody', 'help', 'maintain', 'condition', 'being', ""'somewhat"", 'better', 'Sadly', 'film', 'will', 'probably', 'do', 'little', 'change', 'minds', 'hearts', 'most', 'Americans', 'as', 'far', 'real', 'needs', 'homeless', 'people', 'are', 'concerned', 'are', 'too', 'polarized', 'society', 'who', 'are', 'already', 'mind', 'help', 'will', 'continue', 'doing', 'so', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'will', 'continue', 'path', 'propaganda', 'foolproof', 'same', 'basic', 'message', 'help', 'fellow', 'human', 'beings', 'was', 'put', 'forth', 'fifth', 'century', 'B.C', 'Buddha', 'first', 'century', 'A.D.', 'Christ', 'see', 'example', 'Matt', '25', 'parable', 'Judgment', 'was', 'hungry', 'gave', 'food', 'etc', '19th', 'century', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'A', 'CHRISTMAS', 'CAROL', 'Herman', 'Melville', 'Bartleby', 'Scrivener', 'Leo', 'Tolstoy', 'Death', 'Ivan', 'Ilych', 'Clearly', 'world-class', 'examples', 'good', 'propaganda', 'have', 'often', 'had', 'little', 'effect', 'majority', 'people']",N/A

The dialogue between the characters is very boring at times. And they never actually tell you what's wrong with Jamie Fox character. Is he skitso or does he have another mental illness?

1261783,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B002C39SQK,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[2, 3]","In 2005, Los Angeles Times writer Steve Lopez captured the hearts of thousands of readers with his columns about a former Juilliard musician named Nathaniel Ayers who is living on the streets.  After several columns, Lopez and Ayers would be featured on 60 Minutes and capture the attention of how two people who are absolute different, become good friends.In 2008, Steve Lopez would write a book based on his experience with Nathanial Ayers but also give attention to the homeless in LA's Skid row.  That book would then become a film.The film version of ""THE SOLOIST"" is directed by Joe Wright (""Atonement"" and ""Pride & Prejudice"") and would feature a screenplay by Susannah Grant (""28 Days"", ""Erin Brockovich"" and ""Charlotte's Web""), music by Dario Marianelli (""Atonement"", ""The Brave One"" and ""My World"") and cinematography by Seamus McGarvey (""Atonement"", ""World Trade Center"" and ""Sahara"").The film features a talented cast with Robert Downey Jr. (""Iron Man"", ""Tropic Thunder"", ""Charlie Bartlett"", etc.), Jamie Foxx (""The Kingdom"", ""Jarhead"", ""Ray""), Catherine Keener (""Capote"", ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" and ""Solstice"") and Nelsan Ellis (""True Blood"", ""The Inside"" and ""The Express).VIDEO & AUDIO:""The Soloist"" is presented in 1080p High Definition.  For the most part, the picture quality is absolutely vibrant and colorful.  During the day scenes, we are exposed to the grit and grime of where Nathaniel is living and also, during the night where we see Skid Row in its most unpleasantness.There is plenty of detail from the dirt and grime on the faces of people, the detail of trash and whatever the homeless can find that would benefit them.  For Nathaniel, from the things that he wears on his body, to the paint on his face revealing the cracks and unevenness of the paint, the detail is there.  From well-defined edges and revealing textures.  During daylight scenes, picture quality is vibrant.  During the night time scenes, black levels are quite good. Overall, a solid transfer.As for the audio, audio is presented in English 5.1 Dolby TrueHD (also, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital).  Dialogue remains crisp and clear but the music is what comes alive in this film.  Your front channel speakers definitely makes the soundscape much more immersive.  There is a fair amount of ambience as well from the surrounds.  For a film that doesn't have special effects but depends on its dialogue and music, ""The Soloist"" is well done for a film of this nature.Subtitles are presented in English, English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:Special features included on this Blu-ray are:* Audio Commentary by Joe Wright - A very passionate commentary with Joe talking about certain scenes of the film, working with the talent but also his goal of what he wanted to accomplish by experiencing Skid Row for himself and how the film became a mission to show how bad things are.* An Unlikely Friendship: Making the Soloist - (19:35) Presented in High Definition, this featurette is about how the Producers came to a decision to make Steve Lopez's book into a film.  Filming in Skid Row, filming of the L.A. Philharmonic and actual situations that happened in the film and talking to the real people that the film is based on.  Also, interviews with the talent in the film.* Kindness, Courtesy and Respect - Mr. Ayers and Mr. Lopez - (4:48) Both Nathaniel Ayers and Steve Lopez talk about their respect for each other and what it has meant for each of them to have this special friendship with one another.* One Size Does Not Fit All: Addressing homelessness in Los Angeles - (9:45) Interview with Director Joe Wright, Producer Russ Krasnoff, Orlando Ward (Director of Recovery Services at Midnight Mission), Casey Horan (Executive Director of LAMP) and screenwriter Susannah Grant and those involved with helping the homeless but also showing us how bad things are in Los Angeles but what they are doing to help the homeless through programs and services.* Juilliard: The Education of Nathaniel Ayers - (4:06) Producer Gary Foster talks about Juilliard, the significance of a young black man in the 1970's who received a scholarship to learn at the prestigious school and also a day when Yo Yo Ma met Nathaniel Ayers.* Beth's Story - (2:00) A short animated film about a girl named Beth on how she came from a great family, upon an accident which claimed her parents, her life as a child, an adult and how she became homeless.  How each person on the street has a story, not all were born homeless.* Deleted Scenes - (9:47) Six deleted scenes which include: Blood, Hospital Questions, Audition, I'm no Good, Some Life, I want the Concert to Go On* Theatrical Trailer - (2:32) The original theatrical trailerJUDGMENT CALL:""The Soloist"" is a powerful film and an eye-opener of how compassion and friendship can go along way in helping people in need.For the most part, ""The Soloist"" puts Robert Downey Jr. and Jamie Foxx in a film that features another major performance of both their careers.  The two do a stellar job but for the film as a whole, it is a powerful and moving film but where a film would start to pick up steam as it nears the end, ""The Soloist"" stays consistent with a little drop off.  And I suppose the fact is that the story of Nathaniel Ayers is still ongoing.  Both Lopez and Ayers are friends and it was very important for the film to not have a false happy ending because like in real life, this story is ongoing.And that is where the problem of the film and what people may have with it.  If anything, a film that deals with schizophrenia will easily be compared to the Academy Award winning film ""A Beautiful Mind"" and ""Shine"".  The films which both definitely had a memorable final hour and really showed us the state of mind of one with the mental illness.  These films were dramatic and surprising.  But for ""The Soloist"", the film was about friendship between a writer who has his life changed by meeting this talented performer with schizophrenia and is homeless.If you have read any of the columns by Steve Lopez, we are moved and inspired by his compassion.  As we are in the film.  But for a film, many people expect a storyline that ends with a happy or bad ending.  An ending that will make us laugh, make us cry or make us grinning on our way out to the car.  I felt none of that.As a viewer, first and foremost, I will say that I was entertained and enjoyed the film.  With that being said, it was a film that I was just content with the message but as a film, I was feeling more of ""is this it?""But for the Blu-ray release, there is an important message through this film and the Blu-ray and that is the problem of the homeless in Los Angeles.  How compassion has helped one man, how much it could help many people for those who donate their time.  A doctor, a dentist or someone with provides a service and willing to donate their time in helping the homeless.  And that compassionate side of me, enjoys ""The Soloist"" because of that message and what is featured on the special features is definitely is an eye-opener.Needless to say, ""The Soloist"" is a moving and powerful film but it's a film that falls short of greatness.  As a Blu-ray release, its no doubt a release that is going to entertain and open ones eyes to a major problem that exists nationwide but for a film with two stellar performances, the story of ""The Soloist"" is for the most part, average at best.",4,Blu-ray:  A moving and powerful film!

It may be long but I hope it helps.Good:-I couldn't believe I read reviews that the acting was bad. It was NOT a bad acted movie. Just because the characters in the movie that are based off real life people aren't over-the-top characters inflated to keep you entertained does not make them uninteresting. You have to see the characters as real people with real issues and problems when watching this.-The storyline/plot in contrast to the book? I did not read the book so I cannot pass judgement here. I DID like the movie for what it was. I took from this movie the following:-No matter how hard you try, sometimes you just can't help everyone.-You do not know what is going on in another person's mind. Espescially one you just met. Similar to Mr. Ayers, I know a person who, when you talk to him, you never know what he is going to say and sometimes it makes no sense. He will be talking about what he did today clearly and coherently and then immediately stammer off into a story of thousands of dollars he has coming to him and he will give you (me) some. Also, how it may only take you reaching to help someone up and they will become violent and lash out as Mr Ayers does to Mr Lopez (Downey) in a truly scary way. Seeing how it tears Mr Ayers apart to know he is this way is heart breaking.-Although I am Atheist, there was a moment where Robert Downey is explaining how just being with Mr Ayers and experiencing the music through him was like a religious experience and he is not able to explain it. Kathy Keener says, ""It's grace."" and it really hit me. She seemed to have a way to make you think of the underlying message when she delivered her lines (helpfull or drunken-you have to see it to understand)Bad:-I have to agree that the psychadelic scenes when certain music was playing was more of a distraction. It may have been their way of showing the viewer what Mr Ayers sees or hears but I did not expect a movie that was a Pink Floyd show.-It did seem a bit jumpy in the plot department. Not too bad but enough that I see why some reviews mention it. Everyone knows a movie based off a book cannot include everything from the book. Enough said there.I give it 4 stars because it IS an entertaining, well acted, in-depth look into the mind and life of someone so gifted but who has lost so much and the people who see them for who they are.",4,Mixed reviews,1282780800,"08 26, 2010",2010,2411,"['First', 'foremost', 'have', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'long', 'hope', 'helps.Good', '-I', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'read', 'reviews', 'acting', 'was', 'bad', 'was', 'NOT', 'bad', 'acted', 'movie', 'Just', 'characters', 'movie', 'are', 'based', 'off', 'real', 'life', 'people', 'are', ""n't"", 'over-the-top', 'characters', 'inflated', 'keep', 'entertained', 'not', 'make', 'uninteresting', 'have', 'see', 'characters', 'real', 'people', 'real', 'issues', 'problems', 'when', 'watching', 'this.-The', 'storyline/plot', 'contrast', 'book', 'did', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'can', 'not', 'pass', 'judgement', 'here', 'DID', 'movie', 'what', 'was', 'took', 'movie', 'following', '-No', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'try', 'sometimes', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'everyone.-You', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'person', 'mind', 'Espescially', 'one', 'just', 'met', 'Similar', 'Mr.', 'Ayers', 'know', 'person', 'who', 'when', 'talk', 'never', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'say', 'sometimes', 'sense', 'will', 'be', 'talking', 'what', 'did', 'today', 'clearly', 'coherently', 'then', 'immediately', 'stammer', 'off', 'story', 'thousands', 'dollars', 'coming', 'will', 'give', 'Also', 'how', 'may', 'only', 'take', 'reaching', 'help', 'someone', 'up', 'will', 'become', 'violent', 'out', 'Mr', 'Ayers', 'Mr', 'Lopez', 'Downey', 'truly', 'scary', 'way', 'Seeing', 'how', 'Mr', 'Ayers', 'apart', 'know', 'way', 'heart', 'breaking.-Although', 'am', 'Atheist', 'was', 'moment', 'where', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'explaining', 'how', 'just', 'being', 'Mr', 'Ayers', 'experiencing', 'music', 'was', 'religious', 'experience', 'not', 'able', 'explain', 'Kathy', 'Keener', 'grace', 'really', 'hit', 'seemed', 'have', 'way', 'make', 'think', 'underlying', 'message', 'when', 'delivered', 'lines', 'helpfull', 'drunken-you', 'have', 'see', 'understand', 'Bad', '-I', 'have', 'agree', 'psychadelic', 'scenes', 'when', 'certain', 'music', 'was', 'playing', 'was', 'more', 'distraction', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'way', 'showing', 'viewer', 'what', 'Mr', 'Ayers', 'hears', 'did', 'not', 'expect', 'movie', 'was', 'Pink', 'Floyd', 'show.-It', 'did', 'seem', 'bit', 'jumpy', 'plot', 'department', 'Not', 'too', 'bad', 'enough', 'see', 'why', 'reviews', 'mention', 'Everyone', 'movie', 'based', 'off', 'book', 'can', 'not', 'include', 'everything', 'book', 'Enough', 'said', 'give', '4', 'stars', 'entertaining', 'well', 'acted', 'in-depth', 'look', 'mind', 'life', 'someone', 'so', 'gifted', 'who', 'lost', 'so', 'much', 'people', 'who', 'see', 'who', 'are']",N/A
1261788,A2LRWMHJ1ZK36M,B002C39SQK,e. verrillo,"[13, 16]","Given the strength of the story and the talent of the actors, The Soloist should have been a great film. But instead of a moving tale, all we got were slick visuals, nice production values and a message: Homeless people have it rough. They do, but where the movie failed was in making us care.The relationships between the characters were so undeveloped that you couldn't get close to any of them, and the little that was shown of the homeless was too fragmented to drawn you in. Moreover, there was nothing in Lopez' character to indicate that he cared about the homeless--no motivation, no sense of self-sacrifice. Even when he is confronted with the realities of life on the streets, it doesn't seem to register in any profound way. When Lopez, in a fit of frustration, says ""I quit!"" what is he quitting at? The friendship between Ayers and Lopez was especially unconvincing. One minute Lopez seems to be using Ayers to further his own career, the next he is weeping. If there was supposed to be some kind of epiphany that changed Lopez, the writer missed it.The writer also seems to have confused schizophrenia with synaesthesia. Hearing voices is a common feature of schizophrenia, but seeing sounds isn't. (The scene in which Ayers ""sees"" a Beethoven symphony was lifted straight out of Fantasia--although it wasn't as good). Nor was Ayers believable as a musician. There was nothing in his cello playing to indicate that he had ever had any talent--no vibrato, no dynamics, no real feel for the music. Even in the flashbacks to the young Ayers, his playing was dull, mechanical and completely lacking in musicality. And how did Ayers manage to skip Bach as a student? (There isn't a classical musician on the planet who does not know Bach backwards and forwards.) Ayers in real life may have been a Julliard student, but whoever dubbed for Jamie Foxx certainly wasn't.I'm glad the movie didn't end on a ""they lived happily ever after"" note, with Ayers giving solo recitals and doing just fine on meds. That would have been a real stretch, but it was just as unrealistic to believe that Lopez and his wife got back together. (Why? How?) Their (happy?) reunion was just as flat and unconvincing as the rest of the film.

His friendship with Ayers is totally believable. Lopez is proud when Ayers makes a small step for change in his life.And there are a number of great scenes in the film. The one that stands out of the most is the the scene in which Lopez convinces Ayers to go to a rehearsal for the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra. At the last minute, Ayers refuses to go because he can't take his shopping cart, which contains all of his worldly possessions. Lopez later is forced to compromise with Ayers. He and Ayers race down the streets of LA with Ayers' prized shopping cart so that Ayers can attend the rehearsal. This scene was so sweet and touching.You also feel Lopez's frustrations when he realizes that he must accept Ayers for who he is-- a mentally ill genius.

1261793,A328S9RN3U5M68,B002C39SQK,Grady Harp,"[4, 6]","THE SOLOIST is a difficult film to review. First, the subject matter: a newspaper writer of a human interest column for the LA Times, with personal problems of his own, encounters a schizophrenic homeless man who spends his days playing classical music on a two string violin and provides fodder for a new human interest column - an accidental encounter that develops into a friendship and challenge and some semblance of change in the personalities of both men.  Second, the cast: performances by Jamie Foxx as the gifted homeless Julliard trained cellist Nathaniel Ayers and Robert Downey, Jr. as the troubled and frustrated but kind hearted writer Steve Lopez turn in very fine and credible performances. Third, the message: calling attention to the plight of the homeless and their need for simple acts of kindness is well portrayed.  Fourth, the music that serves as a character in the film: the cello solos are played with grace and style by LA Phil cellist Ben Hong and the LA Philharmonic as conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen and  present in the background and on the screen with in the grandeur of Disney Hall create as solid a film score as possible.  Fifth, the supporting cast: with Catherine Keener in a thankless role as Lopez' boss and ex-wife, Marcos De Silvas as LA Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and Tom Hollander as a cello instructor make the best of the poorly developed roles they are given.So what goes wrong here?  For this viewer the problems lie with the screenplay by Susannah Grant, an acceptable adaptation of Steve Lopez' novel, but so loaded with LA Times promo and info and mawkish sentimentality that the story all but drowns.  Director Joe Wright seems to take the stance of letting the story flow on its own, the only relief being the use of flashbacks that attempt to explain the mental and physical state of Nathaniel Ayers.  This is a film that longs to be loved, but in the end it is only a passable human interest story.

1261794,AKB2PYODH0TKS,B002C39SQK,"Grey Wolffe ""Zeb Kantrowitz""","[2, 2]","In short summary, the movie is about a young black man (Nathan Ayers, Jr) who went to Julliard in New York and dropped out when he began to hear voices.  He was a talented cello player, loved classical music and Beethoven.  But in his early twenties he developed schizophrenia and left school to live on the streets.  The streets were the only place he felt safe as he had also developed a fear of enclosed places (not necessarily claustrophobia but a paranoia about being locked in where people could find him and kill him).  He somehow finds he way to the streets of Los Angeles where he knows he can live outside year round.  Steve Lopez writes a column for the LA Times on unusual people and place in and around the LA basin.  One day Steve sees Nathan on the street and hears him playing a two string violin, you can tell that the man is talented.  Steve writes a column about Nathan and a woman who now has arthritis sends Steve her cello for Nathan.  To play the cello Nathan must have someplace safe to keep it.Up till this point the movie is done very softly and the relationship between Steve and Nathan is more tangential than tangible.  Unfortunately, at this point the movie and the relationship become more convoluted.  One of the major problems for me is that Nathan is shown as a young man at Julliard being played by Jamie Foxx in his forties, makes it hard to tell his deterioration from the disease.  Robert Downey as Steve Lopez is just a little too over the top when it comes to helping Nathan, and oblivious to what is truly happening around him.  Just because you want to help somebody, doesn't mean they want to be helped.  Nathan will not be cured by good intentions and drugs will probably take away his talent, as most drugs for schizophrenia tend to deaden the mind.  (There is a great comment by one of the side characters who used to take Lithium.  Her complaint was that when the drug took away they 'voices' it left her alone with no friends.)There is a whole side issue with a 'christian' (invited by Lopez) to give Nathan cello lessons but is more interested in saving his soul than his talent.  It seemed an unnecessary intrusion into Nathan's life and served no real purpose in the movie.  Many of those on the street because of mental health problems, would rather live that way than in chemical 'restraints'.  Who knows where the line between creativity and insanity lies?  Year ago a friend of mine who is bipolar told me that the reality that 'everyone' wanted him to see, was boring.  He found his reality to be much more entertaining and enlightening.  As we all should know, reality is in the mind of the beholder.Zeb Kantrowitz",3,No One is Truly Alone  Forever,1275782400,"06 6, 2010",2010,2671,"['short', 'summary', 'movie', 'young', 'black', 'man', 'Nathan', 'Ayers', 'Jr', 'who', 'went', 'Julliard', 'New', 'York', 'dropped', 'out', 'when', 'began', 'hear', 'voices', 'was', 'talented', 'cello', 'player', 'loved', 'classical', 'music', 'Beethoven', 'early', 'twenties', 'developed', 'schizophrenia', 'left', 'school', 'live', 'streets', 'streets', 'were', 'only', 'place', 'felt', 'safe', 'had', 'also', 'developed', 'fear', 'enclosed', 'places', 'not', 'necessarily', 'claustrophobia', 'paranoia', 'being', 'locked', 'where', 'people', 'could', 'find', 'kill', 'somehow', 'way', 'streets', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'where', 'can', 'live', 'outside', 'year', 'round', 'Steve', 'Lopez', 'column', 'LA', 'Times', 'unusual', 'people', 'place', 'LA', 'basin', 'One', 'day', 'Steve', 'Nathan', 'street', 'playing', 'two', 'string', 'violin', 'can', 'tell', 'man', 'talented', 'Steve', 'column', 'Nathan', 'woman', 'who', 'now', 'arthritis', 'sends', 'Steve', 'cello', 'Nathan', 'play', 'cello', 'Nathan', 'must', 'have', 'someplace', 'safe', 'keep', 'it.Up', 'till', 'point', 'movie', 'done', 'very', 'softly', 'relationship', 'Steve', 'Nathan', 'more', 'tangential', 'tangible', 'Unfortunately', 'point', 'movie', 'relationship', 'become', 'more', 'convoluted', 'One', 'major', 'problems', 'Nathan', 'shown', 'young', 'man', 'Julliard', 'being', 'played', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'forties', 'hard', 'tell', 'deterioration', 'disease', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Steve', 'Lopez', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'top', 'when', 'helping', 'Nathan', 'oblivious', 'what', 'truly', 'happening', 'Just', 'want', 'help', 'somebody', ""n't"", 'mean', 'want', 'be', 'helped', 'Nathan', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'cured', 'good', 'intentions', 'drugs', 'will', 'probably', 'take', 'away', 'talent', 'most', 'drugs', 'schizophrenia', 'tend', 'deaden', 'mind', 'great', 'comment', 'one', 'side', 'characters', 'who', 'used', 'take', 'Lithium', 'complaint', 'was', 'when', 'drug', 'took', 'away', ""'voices"", 'left', 'alone', 'friends', 'whole', 'side', 'issue', ""'christian"", 'invited', 'Lopez', 'give', 'Nathan', 'cello', 'lessons', 'more', 'interested', 'saving', 'soul', 'talent', 'seemed', 'unnecessary', 'intrusion', 'Nathan', 'life', 'served', 'real', 'purpose', 'movie', 'Many', 'street', 'mental', 'health', 'problems', 'would', 'rather', 'live', 'way', 'chemical', ""'restraints"", 'Who', 'where', 'line', 'creativity', 'insanity', 'lies', 'Year', 'friend', 'mine', 'who', 'bipolar', 'told', 'reality', ""'everyone"", 'wanted', 'see', 'was', 'boring', 'found', 'reality', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'entertaining', 'enlightening', 'should', 'know', 'reality', 'mind', 'beholder.Zeb', 'Kantrowitz']",N/A

Looking for city stories to write about in his LA Times column, Lopez comes across Nathaniel Ayers, a former Juilliard student, now homeless, who plays beautiful classical music in an LA highway tunnel. The movie distorts Lopez's home life, making him a Downey-like loser, and moving wife and kids out of his life to simplify the plot. Ayers is a schizophrenic genius with little need for tutoring or practice. Just give him some meds, the movie seems to say, clean him up a little and plop him on stage, and all will be well. The reality (as captured in the book) is much more complex and difficult to achieve. There, Ayers was good, but very rusty and undisciplined and unreliable, making  a stage comeback unlikely. In a rare but inconsistent nod to the book, the movie does not show him as a clear success.Everything about the movie is amped up and turned up. The skid row scenes are snapshots from hell, with writhing, scamming, madmen filling very inch of the screen. In a rare bad performance, Jamie Foxx never manages to get inside Ayers's madness. He is every inch the talented, sane actor mouthing intricately scripted lines, Ayers's mad associations are lost in his rapid-ire delivery. The film confuses the viewer by inserting psychedelic, impressionistic scenes, as when a fire seems to burn outside Ayers's childhood home, that are hard to tell from the straight scenes that surround them.It's has become a clich&eacute; to say that ""the book was better than the movie"" made from it. But with ""The Soloist,"" the exaggerations of a bad-enough street life, the tampering with Lopez's family, the inability to wrestle with or even to present questions of how best to help the mentally ill, and Foxx's and Downey's surfacey treatment or their roles make ""The Soloist"" a must-miss movie.",2,Like playing a violin with 2 strings,1258848000,"11 22, 2009",2009,1887,"['Soloist', 'crude', 'inept', 'adaptation', 'Steve', 'Lopez', 'fine', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'Looking', 'city', 'stories', 'write', 'LA', 'Times', 'column', 'Lopez', 'Nathaniel', 'Ayers', 'former', 'Juilliard', 'student', 'now', 'homeless', 'who', 'beautiful', 'classical', 'music', 'LA', 'highway', 'tunnel', 'movie', 'Lopez', 'home', 'life', 'making', 'Downey-like', 'loser', 'moving', 'wife', 'kids', 'life', 'simplify', 'plot', 'Ayers', 'schizophrenic', 'genius', 'little', 'need', 'tutoring', 'practice', 'Just', 'give', 'meds', 'movie', 'say', 'clean', 'up', 'little', 'plop', 'stage', 'will', 'be', 'well', 'reality', 'captured', 'book', 'much', 'more', 'complex', 'difficult', 'achieve', 'Ayers', 'was', 'good', 'very', 'rusty', 'undisciplined', 'unreliable', 'making', 'stage', 'comeback', 'unlikely', 'rare', 'inconsistent', 'nod', 'book', 'movie', 'not', 'show', 'clear', 'success.Everything', 'movie', 'amped', 'up', 'turned', 'up', 'skid', 'row', 'scenes', 'are', 'snapshots', 'hell', 'writhing', 'scamming', 'madmen', 'filling', 'very', 'inch', 'screen', 'rare', 'bad', 'performance', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'never', 'get', 'inside', 'Ayers', 'madness', 'inch', 'talented', 'sane', 'actor', 'mouthing', 'intricately', 'scripted', 'lines', 'Ayers', 'mad', 'associations', 'are', 'lost', 'rapid-ire', 'delivery', 'film', 'viewer', 'inserting', 'psychedelic', 'impressionistic', 'scenes', 'when', 'fire', 'burn', 'outside', 'Ayers', 'childhood', 'home', 'are', 'hard', 'tell', 'straight', 'scenes', 'surround', 'them.It', 'become', 'clich', 'eacute', 'say', 'book', 'was', 'better', 'movie', 'made', 'Soloist', 'exaggerations', 'bad-enough', 'street', 'life', 'tampering', 'Lopez', 'family', 'inability', 'wrestle', 'even', 'present', 'questions', 'how', 'best', 'help', 'mentally', 'ill', 'Foxx', 'Downey', 'surfacey', 'treatment', 'roles', 'make', 'Soloist', 'must-miss', 'movie']",N/A

Eventually, both men learn a little something about friendship, dependence, and independence.This movie is based on a fascinating true story, but I did feel at times that the filmmakers were looking more to produce a social comment than a compelling narrative.

1261829,A255E1L105V4MU,B002C39SQK,Robert Carlberg,"[6, 11]","Steve Lopez's book was such a lyrical treat, hitting just the right tone between hope (for improving Nathaniel Ayers' circumstances, for alleviating the tempests of his mental illness, for raising awareness of homelessness in America) and despair (the capriciousness of political winds, the incurability of schizophrenia, the impending death of investigative journalism...)  The book alternately soars and dips, sending the reader on a roller coaster ride of emotions.In screenwriter Susannah Grant's treatment the story becomes flat, predictable, cliched and a very different experience.  The emphasis is turned to Ayers' mental illness rather than his talent, with scene after scene after scene of Jaime Foxx throwing a tantrum while the camera trollies around him in circles.  During one interminably-long scene when Foxx is listening to music the screen shows a lightshow of colored lights, for crying out loud.  What were they thinking???Hardly anything is said in the film of Ayers' experiences at Julliard, hardly anything of his upbringing or early talent or the successes of his early career.  No, this is just another dismissive screed against mental illness, with all the depth of a postcard from the mental hospital.I blame Grant for ruining the 3-dimensionality and humanity of the book.  Foxx and Downey do what they can with what they're given, and there are no serious technical shortcomings in the production.

1261831,A21VR7M8O55EF6,B002C39SQK,Robin Friedman,"[2, 2]","When I saw this movie, I didn't know anything about the factual situation on which it was based. I didn't know about the book by Lopez, one of the two main characters, or the ""60 minutes"" show describing the relationship between Los Angeles Times reporter Steve Lopez and his friend Nathaniel Ayers, a brilliant but deeply troubled musician. Thus, I tried to see the movie for itself, rather than relate it to a life situation or to a book or show.In a corner of Pershing Park in downtown Los Angeles, there is a large statue of the great composer Beethoven. I don't know why it is there, but a commemoration of Beethoven needs no excuse. A reporter named Steve Lopez, played by Robert Downey Jr., visits Pershing Park for lunch.  Always on the lookout for a good story, Lopez meets an unlikely companion near the Beethoven statue: a homeless African American man who pushes an old shopping cart with all his worldy possessions and who plays a battered two-string violin. This person is Nathaniel Ayers played by Jamie Foxx. The two men strike up a conversation and Lopez learns that Ayers had once attended the prestigious Juilliard School of Music in New York City.At first, Lopez is opportunistic, looking primarily to make a good story. But he soon develops a genuine friendship for Ayers. The homeless and visibly disturbed Ayers had been a child prodigy and then a student of the cello at Juilliard. When Lopez' first column about Ayers appears,stressing his musical gifts and his descent into homelessness, a generous woman gives Lopez her cello to give to Ayers. Ayers loves the instrument and loves music. Ayers' favorite composer is Beethoven, and he plays and talks about Beethoven's music constantly, including the cello line from the third symphony, string quartets, the cello sonatas, the ""Triple"" concerto, and more.Ayers appears to be both schizophrenic and paranoid. He frequents a Los Angeles homeless shelter known as ""The Lamp"" while spending his days dodging traffic and trying to make music. The movie describes Lopez' efforts to help Ayers pursue his music again.The movie describes the redemptive power of music, particularly the music of Beethoven. Ayers plays his music with a passion that any lover of music will recognize. Lopez, who is not musical, comes to understand this trait in his friend. The many scenes involving Beethoven, his statue, Ayer's playing and ramblings, and the playing of other musicians shows the power of his music to bring value to life. One of the most moving scenes in this movie comes at the end. While the credits roll at the end of the movie, the Los Angeles Phiharmonic plays the beautiful, serene slow movement from Beethoven's ""Choral"" symphony. The movie was filed in Los Angeles and in Cleveland, where Ayers spent his childhood.Ayer's life and Beethoven's music are juxtaposed effectively with skid row Los Angeles. Many of the scenes were shot on location and feature actual residents of The Lamp. These scenes were effective for what they showed of skid row and for their relationship to Ayers' illness and to the power of music. Beethoven of course did not have the power to cure schizophrenia. His music, however, gave Ayers a reason to live.Portions of the movie don't work very well. There is unnecessary psychedelic imagery accompanying many of the scenes featuring Beethoven's music. And the movie tends to wander when it delves into Lozez' private life, separate from his relationship to Ayers. But the core of the movie, the friendship, Ayers' troubled life, his love of music and of Beethoven, and the portrayal of skid row make this movie worth seeing. The acting of the two major characters, Downey and Foxx is persuasive.I thought of one of my favorite authors, Charles Bukowski, in watching this movie. Bukowski is sometimes called the ""Poet of Skid Row"". He is famous for his tough, hardscrabble life and for his love of classical music. But compared to Ayers and The Lamp, Bukowski appears almost middle class and staid. This movie illustrates the power of music to sustain life even under the most trying emotional and physical surroundings.Robin Friedman",4,Beethoven on Skid Row,1267401600,"03 1, 2010",2010,4137,"['When', 'saw', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'factual', 'situation', 'was', 'based', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'book', 'Lopez', 'one', 'two', 'main', 'characters', '60', 'minutes', 'show', 'describing', 'relationship', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Times', 'reporter', 'Steve', 'Lopez', 'friend', 'Nathaniel', 'Ayers', 'brilliant', 'deeply', 'troubled', 'musician', 'Thus', 'tried', 'see', 'movie', 'rather', 'relate', 'life', 'situation', 'book', 'show.In', 'corner', 'Pershing', 'Park', 'downtown', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'large', 'statue', 'great', 'composer', 'Beethoven', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'there', 'commemoration', 'Beethoven', 'excuse', 'reporter', 'named', 'Steve', 'Lopez', 'played', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'Pershing', 'Park', 'lunch', 'Always', 'lookout', 'good', 'story', 'Lopez', 'unlikely', 'companion', 'Beethoven', 'statue', 'homeless', 'African', 'American', 'man', 'who', 'old', 'shopping', 'cart', 'worldy', 'possessions', 'who', 'battered', 'two-string', 'violin', 'person', 'Nathaniel', 'Ayers', 'played', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'two', 'men', 'strike', 'up', 'conversation', 'Lopez', 'Ayers', 'had', 'once', 'attended', 'prestigious', 'Juilliard', 'School', 'Music', 'New', 'York', 'City.At', 'first', 'Lopez', 'opportunistic', 'looking', 'primarily', 'make', 'good', 'story', 'soon', 'genuine', 'friendship', 'Ayers', 'homeless', 'visibly', 'disturbed', 'Ayers', 'had', 'been', 'child', 'prodigy', 'then', 'student', 'cello', 'Juilliard', 'When', 'Lopez', 'first', 'column', 'Ayers', 'stressing', 'musical', 'gifts', 'descent', 'homelessness', 'generous', 'woman', 'Lopez', 'cello', 'give', 'Ayers', 'Ayers', 'instrument', 'loves', 'music', 'Ayers', 'favorite', 'composer', 'Beethoven', 'talks', 'Beethoven', 'music', 'constantly', 'including', 'cello', 'line', 'third', 'symphony', 'string', 'quartets', 'cello', 'sonatas', 'Triple', 'concerto', 'more.Ayers', 'be', 'schizophrenic', 'paranoid', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'homeless', 'shelter', 'known', 'Lamp', 'spending', 'days', 'dodging', 'traffic', 'trying', 'make', 'music', 'movie', 'Lopez', 'efforts', 'help', 'Ayers', 'pursue', 'music', 'again.The', 'movie', 'redemptive', 'power', 'music', 'particularly', 'music', 'Beethoven', 'Ayers', 'music', 'passion', 'lover', 'music', 'will', 'recognize', 'Lopez', 'who', 'not', 'musical', 'understand', 'trait', 'friend', 'many', 'scenes', 'involving', 'Beethoven', 'statue', 'Ayer', 'playing', 'ramblings', 'playing', 'other', 'musicians', 'power', 'music', 'bring', 'value', 'life', 'One', 'most', 'moving', 'scenes', 'movie', 'end', 'credits', 'roll', 'end', 'movie', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Phiharmonic', 'beautiful', 'serene', 'slow', 'movement', 'Beethoven', 'Choral', 'symphony', 'movie', 'was', 'filed', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Cleveland', 'where', 'Ayers', 'spent', 'childhood.Ayer', 'life', 'Beethoven', 'music', 'are', 'juxtaposed', 'effectively', 'skid', 'row', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Many', 'scenes', 'were', 'shot', 'location', 'feature', 'actual', 'residents', 'Lamp', 'scenes', 'were', 'effective', 'what', 'showed', 'skid', 'row', 'relationship', 'Ayers', 'illness', 'power', 'music', 'Beethoven', 'course', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'power', 'cure', 'schizophrenia', 'music', 'however', 'gave', 'Ayers', 'reason', 'live.Portions', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'very', 'well', 'unnecessary', 'psychedelic', 'imagery', 'accompanying', 'many', 'scenes', 'featuring', 'Beethoven', 'music', 'movie', 'wander', 'when', 'Lozez', 'private', 'life', 'separate', 'relationship', 'Ayers', 'core', 'movie', 'friendship', 'Ayers', 'troubled', 'life', 'love', 'music', 'Beethoven', 'portrayal', 'skid', 'row', 'make', 'movie', 'seeing', 'acting', 'two', 'major', 'characters', 'Downey', 'Foxx', 'persuasive.I', 'thought', 'one', 'favorite', 'authors', 'Charles', 'Bukowski', 'watching', 'movie', 'Bukowski', 'sometimes', 'called', 'Poet', 'Skid', 'Row', 'famous', 'tough', 'hardscrabble', 'life', 'love', 'classical', 'music', 'compared', 'Ayers', 'Lamp', 'Bukowski', 'almost', 'middle', 'class', 'staid', 'movie', 'power', 'music', 'sustain', 'life', 'even', 'most', 'trying', 'emotional', 'physical', 'surroundings.Robin', 'Friedman']",N/A

Guess that's just Hollywood.I'm a big fan of Steve Lopez's writing and have been since he was a columnist for The Philadelphia Inquirer. When the book came out I read it and even listened to the audio version. So I was very much looking forward to the film, being a big Jamie Foxx fan.After watching the two-hours-plus film on this DVD, I can't believe it's the same story. While the book concentrated on the music inside Nathaniel's head and in his fingers, and less on Lopez's home and personal life, the movie did just the opposite. There's a lot more of Lopez (well Robert Downey Jr.) than Nathaniel and the opportunity to SHOW more music is lost. The film drags (A LOT). As the Director says in at least two of the featurettes - which are bonuses - he want to concentrate on the homeless in LA and the Lamp Center. Sure, but this takes away from Nathaniel. The book is called ""The Soloist"", not ""Homeless in LA"". He beats the point to death.I enjoyed Downey's acting and he takes on some of Lopez's mannerisms. Foxx does a good job of getting the emotion, though he does not look like Nathaniel and his speech mannerisms are often difficult to understand.Like one of the other reviewers here said ""READ THE BOOK"" (or even listen to the audio version).

1261840,A2V2XRUGEYYCGG,B002C39SQK,Thomas Glebe,"[20, 20]","Having casually checked this out recently, knowing absolutely nothing about the film beforehand except from its brief description on cable, which sounded interesting to me, I was and will forever continue to be, stunned by how great this movie is, for me at least.  I have since watched extended parts of it as well as the whole thing, several times, have permanently recorded it onto DVD for future enjoyment, and my initial reactions remain the same with each viewing.  This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.  The fact that this didn't really make any box office buzz or profit is not surprising, given the subject matter.  But the generally favorable but highly mixed, both positive and negative feelings and opinions about it from other reviewers and critics, and especially the lack of industry awards for this (i.e., Golden Globes, Oscars, etc.), are puzzling to me.IMHO, this film is simply wonderful throughout, beginning to end, and has moved me to very moist eyes upon each and every viewing, tears of both profound sadness and sublime joy alike.  I suspect that most people who have seen this, and have given it thumbs down, are missing the boat here.  Although I always try to give, at times grudgingly, respect for the opinions, beliefs, and feelings of intelligent, enlightened folks, no matter what the film, I find it hard to fathom how and why anyone could watch this, stick with it to the end, and not see this as something really special.The first time I watched this ""cold,"" knowing almost nothing about it and only later discovering that it was all based upon a true story and the characters based upon real people, I nonetheless strongly suspected such was the case early on in the film and to the finish.  It just had to be, I reasoned, because so many Los Angeles locales and environments, and particularly specific ""Angeleno"" details and ideas explored within it, rang so true and familiar to me.  This is because of my own personal experiences with LA-centric, relevant places, people, concepts, issues, and events of substance and reality, for nearly a third of my lifetime.Perhaps the main reason why a lot of folks who didn't or don't think that highly of this as I do, is because of this lack of personal connectedness to it, which I have and they may not.  And that goes to all the filthy rich big shots of Hollyweird who chose to basically ignore this, come awards time.  I accept these factors as givens, but honestly, this film has universal themes and observations, which really should appeal to most common people with sentimental hearts and rational minds.  That this didn't seem to resonate powerfully with more upon release or since, I can accept.  But it's a shame, because this really is extraordinary filmmaking, and distinctively honors what it apparently sets out to pay homage to, throughout.The film, screenplay adaptation by Susannah Grant, is based on a series of columns written by Los Angeles Times columnist Steve Lopez, who chronicled the plight of Mister Nathaniel Ayers, Jr., a middle-aged, homeless, drifting LA ""crazy,"" but a former Julliard-trained musician with schizophrenia, originally from Cleveland, Ohio.  The beginnings of this project were eventually inspired by and detailed in Lopez's book ""The Soloist: A Lost Dream, an Unlikely Friendship, and the Redemptive Power of Music"" which was published in the spring of 2008.Nicely but not heavy-handedly or intrusively directed by Joe Wright, starring Jamie Foxx as Nathaniel and Robert Downey Jr. as Steve, the movie features original soundtrack music from Golden Globe and Academy Award-winning composer Dario Marianelli, as well as subtle and intense excerpts from works by Beethoven and the enchanting Cello Suite No. 1 by Bach.  Needless to say, throughout, great music and the possible redemptive love, ""grace,"" and healing power of it (with even a bit of Neil Diamond thrown in), plays a big part here.  But within that basic structure and notion, a superlative visual and cinematic rendering of same, exemplifies the life-changing supremacy of simple friendship which can develop between often-disparate human beings, and which can bring to each, symbiotic rewards.  For ""the soloist"" here doesn't just apply or refer to homeless, at times obviously schizophrenic but talented Nathaniel, but to Steve the talented and humanistic yet cynical reporter as well.  By film's end, both forge a life-affirming relationship, despite their immensely different personal blessings and circumstances in life.  A real life, rewarding relationship and friendship which apparently continues to present day.Detailed musical and visual bits in this movie take quite moving and unexpected twists and turns throughout, more than once from far above and apart from the noisy madness of Los Angeles.  And about an hour into the film, it unashamedly ventures (when Nathaniel closes his eyes and listens to a full symphony orchestra playing Ludwig Van) into a very delightful and totally spiritual, ""closed-eye vision"" colorful representation of music as might've been imagined by the late, legendary experimental filmmaker Stan Brakhage.  This ""closed-eye"" section, while brief, came as a complete surprise to me, but should resonate with anyone who has ever really experienced firsthand, the exquisite ""beauty"" of great music as a transcendental art form.  Truth be told however, these moments are only a few in a series of ever meaningful and majestic ones, in what I consider a virtually perfect film.This movie is not without its lighter sides, and brief but effective moments of humor, but is at its best when relating various true, and serious elements of the modern USA, social/civilized failings as a whole.  These range from the obvious, yet-unlearned tragedies/lessons of Hurricane Katrina's impoverished masses, to its equating of those with the continuing utter shame of LA's skid row and homelessness problems and our whole depraved ""health-care"" system.  Also dealt effectively with is the complex and at times troubling, but deeply romantic (in the classic sense) relationship between Lopez the reporter and his ex-wife and co-worker/boss.  As well as the search for connectedness to their fellow human beings in a world seemingly gone mad, among which all the characters in this movie, share equally.As I've said, this film deals with subjects, people, places, and situations which are uniquely familiar to me, having spent so much time in Southern California in circumstances similar to both that of Mister Steve Lopez and Mister Nathaniel Ayers. Jr.  At times there, I was near the top, and other times near the bottom.  And I can speak with factual understanding of being both a part of the highs of the fancy award ceremony world of mayors and celebrities which Lopez experiences, to nearly being homeless out there myself in the unbelievably bleak environment of skid row and surroundings, which makes up Nathaniel's world.I could write so much more in praise of this amazing filmic endeavor, but I will just say this in closing.  This is truly a work of art, its power and realism enhanced by true events and people and locales, and while it may not be fully appreciated as I write this, I'm sure in the future, it will be seen as a classic, great film with a message which almost everyone, in time, should eventually identify with, in a very special, if wholly individual way.  And by the way, again, the very title refers both to Mr. Ayers AND Mr. Lopez, if some haven't caught on or never will, to that.This is a work, minute by precious minute, to be revered and cherished forever, which I at least, most certainly will.",5,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time...,1264118400,"01 22, 2010",2010,7662,"['Having', 'casually', 'checked', 'out', 'recently',

The Soloist also shows how much pressure Africans in America are under when they pursue mastery of anything. The movie mostly shows how inadequate the United State's response is to mental illness. If you have a mental illness in the U. S. you may be eligible for resources from the government or a foundation. That is if you are not too ill to navigate through a process that most healthy people do not understand. The Soloist shows how the citizens with mental illness in what is called the greatest country on earth have no protection. Nothing in the vast American system reaches out to the mentally ill in any sufficient way. The Soloist shows you the life of a man suffering with mental illness, vulnerable to everything.",4,Vulnerable To Everything,1323216000,"12 7, 2011",2011,848,"['Soloist', 'film', 'schizophrenia', 'how', 'psychological', 'disorder', 'life', 'upside', 'down', 'Soloist', 'also', 'how', 'much', 'pressure', 'Africans', 'America', 'are', 'when', 'pursue', 'mastery', 'anything', 'movie', 'mostly', 'how', 'inadequate', 'United', 'State', 'response', 'mental', 'illness', 'have', 'mental', 'illness', 'U.', 'S.', 'may', 'be', 'eligible', 'resources', 'government', 'foundation', 'are', 'not', 'too', 'ill', 'navigate', 'process', 'most', 'healthy', 'people', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'Soloist', 'how', 'citizens', 'mental', 'illness', 'what', 'called', 'greatest', 'country', 'earth', 'have', 'protection', 'Nothing', 'vast', 'American', 'system', 'out', 'mentally', 'ill', 'sufficient', 'way', 'Soloist', 'life', 'man', 'suffering', 'mental', 'illness', 'vulnerable', 'everything']",N/A
1261842,A4JHEO7H330AF,B002C39SQK,Tom Brody,"[1, 1]","SOLOIST, starring Jamie Foxx (homeless former music student) and Robert Downey, Jr. (newspaper reporter) is a propulsive, forward-moving drama about a talented music student who has the misfortune of acquiring a mental illness part-way through his academic career as a student at Juilliard School of Music.  In a nutshell, Jamie Foxx starts out as a talented high school kid in a lower middle class neighborhood.  His talent is recognized, and he chooses cello.  The film shows some charming scenes, by way of flash-backs, of the boy's first efforts at impressing his teachers with his cello-playing abilities.  Throughout the film, Jamie Foxx is almost fixated on Beethoven's 5th Symphony.  Jamie Foxx is discovered by the newspaper reporter, while playing a violin having only two strings.  After his first interview, Downey is able to pen the first of a series of newspaper articles, called, ""HE'S GOT THE WORLD ON TWO STRINGS.""  (Get it?  This is a play on the common expression, ""He's got the world on a string."")In fits and starts, Robert Downey acquires more and more cooperation with Jamie Foxx, draws him partially out of his shell.  Jamie Foxx is provided with a free cello, and he willingly plays music for the other misfortunates at the homeless shelter.  The film really does not have a surprise ending.  Instead, the film ends on a plateau, where the plateau discloses the limit of how much a mentally ill person can recover with the aid of hands-on coaching and friendship.The film can be seen on several levels:(1) ODD COUPLE FRIENDSHIPS.  This movie, SOLOIST, is a bit like OF MICE AND MEN, starring Gary Sinise and John Malkovich.  In both movies, a normal man befriends a mentally ill man, and attempts to guide him through life.  OF MICE AND MEN ends tragically.  SOLOIST does not have a tragic ending. In SOLOIST, Robert Downey takes a businesslike approach to Jamie Foxx, and insists that Jamie Foxx honor certain appointments, and meet certain deadlines.  Generally, the Jamie Foxx character is able to comply (with the unfortunate exception of his cello debut in Disney concert hall).(2) PAEN TO CLASSICAL MUSIC.  SOLOIST is a paen to classical music, just as the movie AMADEUS is a paen to classical music.  In SOLOIST, one of the more magical moments occurs in an underpass, where Robert Downey first hands Jamie Foxx a cello, and Jamie Foxx begins to play.  Even though Jamie Foxx had not touched a cello in some thirty years, he begins to play a slow tune from Beethoven.  His eyes are shut while playing, and one can sense his ecstasy, as he plays.  This situation is much the same as Antonio Salieri's (actor F.Murray Abraham) descriptions of Mozart's music, where Salieri describes how one particular theme is effortlessly handed from one instrument to another, in Mozart's SERENADE IN B FLAT (GRAN PARTITA).  The Salieri character says, ""This was a music I'd never heard. Filled with such longing, such unfulfillable longing. It seemed to me that I was hearing the voice of God.""  In SOLOIST, this is the same sort of admiration that Jamie Foxx has towards the music of Beethoven.(3) FELLINIESQUE MADNESS.  The available definitions of ""Felliniesque"" include, ""fantastical or surreal,"" ""a fascination with the bizarre,"" and ""a certain flamboyant lyricism.""  The scenes of homeless shelters in Los Angeles have an artistic quality of their own.  The groups of homeless people are probably more closely packed together, and likely have more variety, then in a real homeless shelter.  At any rate, there is an enormous obese woman in a green-striped sweater who is always in motion, swaying and dancing.  There is a man with a face containing thousands of dark speckles.  A woman has huge hoop-earrings, and a hooplike hairdo.  The characters are like those in the bar scene in Star Wars, that is, the scene in CHALMUN'S CANTINA located in the planet Tatooine.  Moreover, in each scene in SOLOIST, Jamie Foxx appears with a different home-grown costume.(4) SLAPSTICK.  The raccoon scenes, which involve coyote urine, serve as a welcome bit of slapstick.  This is because the storyline could generally be construed as a tragedy.  The bathroom urine-spilling scene also serves as slapstick.  These slapstick scenes are woven seamlessly into the storyline, in that the bathroom scene encompasses a critical development point in the story.  Another bit of humor takes the form of Robert Downey interviewing a man in the atheist's society, for example, by asking if they talk about various other things that they do NOT believe in during their meetings.  These token bits of comedy provide temporary relief from the tragedy of Jamie Foxx's mental illness, and from the general tragedic lifestyle of all of the residents at the homeless shelter.",5,"A

It added no romance, no tension, no valid insight into the author's reason for getting involved with the mentally ill Mr. Ayers. It may have made sense to condense three shrinks and two patient advocates into one character, but the screenwriter chose the one mental health professional that Mr. Ayers disliked, and instead made him saintly. The book's climax was powerful, and the movie's kind of blah. There is a fictional recital in the film that Mr. Ayers' destroys due to his schizophrenic symptoms. That did not happen in the book. There is a gratuitous scene of an evangelical Christian musician working harder to convert Mr. Ayers that he was to help him regain his cello technique. That also wasn't in the book. A really stupid few minutes showing the newspaper columnist wrestling with a bag of coyote urine to discourage raccoons not only wasn't in the book, it did not help the film, and neither did a fictional bike crash to open the movie. The film should have been mostly about Mr. Ayers, heavily supported by Robert Downey Jr.'s character. Instead, it was about Steve Lopez, with Mr. Ayers taking a featured role in his life. I don't mind if you like the movie better than I did...some moments in it are glorious. But read the book, please. It does not take much longer than viewing the movie does, and it has so much more impact, offers brief but heart-wrenching insights into the complexities of life for schizophrenics, and has frequent moments of superb description, which the film fails to translate to the screen.",3,OK film version of a far superior book...,1300665600,"03 21, 2011",2011,2066,"['book', 'film', 'version', 'changed', 'length', 'supposed', 'clarity', 'need', 'visual', 'impact', 'appeal', 'movie', 'buffs', 'instead', 'book', 'fans', 'etc', 'Rarely', 'are', 'changes', 'improvements', 'original', 'source', 'Soloist', 'not', 'director', 'scriptwriter', 'how', 'put', 'most', 'powerful', 'moments', 'thoughts', 'book', 'up', 'screen', 'are', 'understandable', 'changes', 'here', 'stupid', 'make', 'Steve', 'Lopez', 'happily', 'married', 'father', 'two', 'guy', 'divorced', 'working', 'ex', 'added', 'romance', 'tension', 'valid', 'insight', 'author', 'reason', 'getting', 'involved', 'mentally', 'ill', 'Mr.', 'Ayers', 'may', 'have', 'made', 'sense', 'condense', 'three', 'shrinks', 'two', 'patient', 'advocates', 'one', 'character', 'screenwriter', 'chose', 'one', 'mental', 'health', 'professional', 'Mr.', 'Ayers', 'disliked', 'instead', 'made', 'saintly', 'book', 'climax', 'was', 'powerful', 'movie', 'kind', 'blah', 'fictional', 'recital', 'film', 'Mr.', 'Ayers', 'destroys', 'due', 'schizophrenic', 'symptoms', 'did', 'not', 'happen', 'book', 'gratuitous', 'scene', 'evangelical', 'Christian', 'musician', 'working', 'harder', 'convert', 'Mr.', 'Ayers', 'was', 'help', 'regain', 'cello', 'technique', 'also', 'was', ""n't"", 'book', 'really', 'stupid', 'few', 'minutes', 'showing', 'newspaper', 'columnist', 'wrestling', 'bag', 'coyote', 'urine', 'discourage', 'raccoons', 'not', 'only', 'was', ""n't"", 'book', 'did', 'not', 'help', 'film', 'neither', 'did', 'fictional', 'bike', 'crash', 'open', 'movie', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'mostly', 'Mr.', 'Ayers', 'heavily', 'supported', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'character', 'Instead', 'was', 'Steve', 'Lopez', 'Mr.', 'Ayers', 'taking', 'featured', 'role', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'like', 'movie', 'better', 'did', 'moments', 'are', 'glorious', 'read', 'book', 'please', 'not', 'take', 'much', 'longer', 'viewing', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'impact', 'brief', 'heart-wrenching', 'insights', 'complexities', 'life', 'schizophrenics', 'frequent', 'moments', 'superb', 'description', 'film', 'translate', 'screen']",N/A
1261847,A1XX1KKXH9W7I7,B002C39SQK,wolfgang731,"[1, 2]","The Soloist is the kind of film that even though its heart is in the right place, it fails to pull in the viewer, making him truly appreciate the reality of its characters.  What makes this even more frustrating is that we're dealing with real people whom you would think would be far more relatable.  At all times, I was fully aware of the fact that I was watching a movie and only at certain moments, felt that I was living the story alongside these two interesting yet disparate men whose lives are intertwined by a simple twist of fate.  Both Downey Jr. and Foxx turn in fine and heartfelt performances so you would think that eliciting sympathy from the audience would be a foregone conclusion, but not in my case.  The film is structured in such a way that it wholly misses the emotional mark, which you think, due to its subject matter, would be foregone conclusion.  Certain ideas worked quite well, among them, the scenes where Nathaniel's schizophrania is brought to the foreground.  We hear the incessant, hushed whispering voices that tormented him on a regular basis, ultimately derailing his life and destroying his fledgling career as a classical musician.  This was accomplished with a sort of ""layering"" or ""stacking"" of both the audio and the visual, creating a sense of increased agitation and desperation with no hope of escape for him.  Those particular scenes were the most effective in the entire film, helping me relate to Nathaniel's plight and making me want to just pause the film.  In those moments, the viewer comes to appreciate the torment that is this poor gentleman's life.  On the other hand, using lighting devices to illustrate what Nathaniel saw/felt when he heard Beethoven's music felt gimmicky not to mention dated and overlong.  I haven't read the book, so it's possible that this was, in fact, the way Nathaniel ""sees"" music but from a cinematic standpoint, it simply didn't work.  This is not a horrible film nor is it a boring one. I just found it uninvolving.  Sad, really, because in terms of potential, resources and talent, nothing was lacking.",3,"Fine, but didn't live up to its own aspirations",1264377600,"01 25, 2010",2010,2092,"['Soloist', 'kind', 'film', 'even', 'heart', 'right', 'place', 'pull', 'viewer', 'making', 'truly', 'appreciate', 'reality', 'characters', 'What', 'even', 'more', 'frustrating', ""'re"", 'dealing', 'real', 'people', 'whom', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'relatable', 'times', 'was', 'fully', 'aware', 'fact', 'was', 'watching', 'movie', 'only', 'certain', 'moments', 'felt', 'was', 'living', 'story', 'two', 'interesting', 'yet', 'disparate', 'men', 'lives', 'are', 'intertwined', 'simple', 'twist', 'fate', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'Foxx', 'turn', 'fine', 'heartfelt', 'performances', 'would', 'think', 'eliciting', 'sympathy', 'audience', 'would', 'be', 'foregone', 'conclusion', 'not', 'case', 'film', 'structured', 'such', 'way', 'wholly', 'emotional', 'mark', 'think', 'due', 'subject', 'matter', 'would', 'be', 'foregone', 'conclusion', 'Certain', 'ideas', 'worked', 'quite', 'well', 'scenes', 'where', 'Nathaniel', 'schizophrania', 'brought', 'foreground', 'hear', 'incessant', 'hushed', 'whispering', 'voices', 'tormented', 'regular', 'basis', 'ultimately', 'derailing', 'life', 'destroying', 'fledgling', 'career', 'classical', 'musician', 'was', 'accomplished', 'sort', 'layering', 'stacking', 'audio', 'visual', 'creating', 'sense', 'increased', 'agitation', 'desperation', 'hope', 'escape', 'particular', 'scenes', 'were', 'most', 'effective', 'entire', 'film', 'helping', 'relate', 'Nathaniel', 'plight', 'making', 'want', 'just', 'pause', 'film', 'moments', 'viewer', 'appreciate', 'torment', 'poor', 'gentleman', 'life', 'other', 'hand', 'using', 'lighting', 'devices', 'illustrate', 'what', 'Nathaniel', 'saw/felt', 'when', 'heard', 'Beethoven', 'music', 'felt', 'gimmicky', 'not', 'mention', 'dated', 'overlong', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'possible', 'was', 'fact', 'way', 'Nathaniel', 'sees', 'music', 'cinematic', 'standpoint', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'not', 'horrible', 'film', 'boring', 'one', 'just', 'found', 'uninvolving', 'Sad', 'really', 'terms', 'potential', 'resources', 'talent', 'nothing', 'was', 'lacking']",N/A
