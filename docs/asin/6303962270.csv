You don't know where this movie is going until it takes you there.  The opening scene of the movie is absolutely spellbinding, equal in every respect with the scene from Lawrence of Arabia in which the man in black robes rides through the shimmering desert air and eventually comes close enough to be seen clearly.  Ed Harris powerfully portrays a compelling and driven character, by far the most thought provoking character in any western I've ever seen.

392900,A34Q0S8PKOJEKP,6303962270,Fred W. Anson (aka &#34;Mr. IT&#34;),"[5, 5]","This made for TV movie was a wonderful surprise! The production is superb and the cast outstanding. In fact, I believe that it would have done well as a theatrical release!I only take issue with two things:1) This fine movie has never been released on DVD and it is certainly worthy of such a reissue -- hopefully with some special features.2) I am a Mormon Studies Scholar and I purchased this video to get acquainted with what is considered one of the definitive, watershed pieces of period fiction literature commenting on Utah Mormonism from a ""Gentile"" perspective.This aspect of Zane Grey's novel is hinted at but not explicit in this production - I assume to not offend the Mormons in the 1996 nationwide broadcast audience. However this aspect was a big part of Zane Grey's novel:""Riders of the Purple Sage was written in 1912 to partly present the influx of Mormon settlers into Utah (1847-1857) as a backdrop for the plot (1871). The Mormons had built the Kirtland Temple in Kirtland, Ohio in 1831, and Zane Grey would have been familiar with the Mormon sect given that he grew up in Zanesville, Ohio.Plural marriage was only officially prohibited by the Mormons with the issuing of the First and Second Manifesto in 1890 and 1904 respectively. In 1871, mainstream American society found plural marriage offensive. Even after the Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act was passed in 1862, Lincoln had no intent to enforce it and the practice had continued. Therefore, Zane Grey described the distaste of the institution through Lassiter in 1912 only after the practice had ended.""[...]So Grey was not only attempting to write a riveting story, he was also attempting to voice his objection to the cruelty of Mormon polygamy - which continues to this day. Just consider this excerpt from the novel:""I'd like to tell you why I'm goin',"" he continued, in coldness he had seldom used to her. She remarked it, but it was the same to her as if he had spoken with his old gentle warmth. ""But I reckon I won't. Only, I'll say that mercy an' goodness, such as is in you, though they're the grand things in human nature, can't be lived up to on this Utah border. Life's hell out here. You think--or you used to think--that your religion made this life heaven. Mebbe them scales on your eyes has dropped now. Jane, I wouldn't have you no different, an' that's why I'm going to try to hide you somewhere in this Pass. I'd like to hide many more women, for I've come to see there are more like you among your people. An' I'd like you to see jest how hard an' cruel this border life is. It's bloody. You'd think churches an' churchmen would make it better. They make it worse. You give names to things--bishops, elders, ministers, Mormonism, duty, faith, glory. You dream--or you're driven mad. I'm a man, an' I know. I name fanatics, followers, blind women, oppressors, thieves, ranchers, rustlers, riders. An' we have--what you've lived through these last months. It can't be helped. But it can't last always.""(excerpted from Chapter 23, ""The Fall of Balancing Rock"")Without these themes the story is simultaneously more confusing as well as less powerful and socially relevant. I can certainly understand the producer's decision to make this 1996 production ""politically correct"" but I really think that the movie would have been even stronger if he hadn't.Never-the-less, this is one the best westerns that I've ever watched.

392903,A3ELSU1SHRX09Y,6303962270,skunktrain,"[60, 61]","I cannot say how pleased I am that I succumbed to temptation, and ordered this tape. It is wonderful--will be one of my favorite Westerns.I saw this film with my sweet grandmotherly mom, who is a big Zane Grey fan. She loved the film too, but she said she would have liked to seen two younger stars, instead of Ed Harris and Amy Madigan (real-life husband and wife). I quickly disabused her of her absurd notion that these two fine actors were miscast. They are wonderful, and give real and exceptional performances. Their maturity is an asset to the film. (I confess, I envy Madigan's ability to look so lovely and natural without any noticable makeup!) And Harris is an Oscar-nominated actor, to boot! They are both very capable actors, attractive and well-suited for this film.The story is unusual in my opinion. A female (Madigan) is the central character, and she is a strong, independent person. I found her to be a refreshing change from the typical ""macho"" male-centered Western we are often used to seeing. She is a member of a close-knit religious sect (in the book they are Mormon, but the film does not specify). She is being pressured by some in her community to marry a particular man, who makes it obvious that he just wants her land and cattle. This fellow does many devious and underhanded things in his attempts to coerce her to marry him. A total creep.In comes Harris's character, Lassiter, with his own agenda of revenge. He's a mysterious and seemingly formidable character, with a reputation as a dangerous gunman. He hangs around to help her out and to protect her from those who wish to control and dominate her. Lassiter also wants to glean some answers from her--things only she knows. And, of course, along the way, he develops feelings for her.Henry Thomas (little Elliot of ""E.T."", all grown up now) does a wonderful job as a youthful friend of Madigan, and his romance with a mysterious girl is very sweet as well.Another thing I kept on appreciating throughout this movie is the outstanding scenery. True, if the story had been stale or acting been bad, the scenery wouldn't have made up for it, but as it was, it was a sublime icing on the cake. Beautiful photography, all through the film.This movie was gripping, had some pretty exciting plot twists along the way, and kept us hanging until the end.Highly recommended--a good western drama and romance.
