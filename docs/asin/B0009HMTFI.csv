905708,A150QS4IZB3XJ,B0009HMTFI,"April Vawter ""Wilderness Photographer""","[1, 2]","This ""documentary"" barely qualifies as informational on any level.  They seem to be trying to disprove the existence of extraterrestrial visitors by showing the viewer the most absurd and easily disproven reports, faked photos and videos as well as several completely irrelevant departures from anything actually related to the real study of UFOs.There was nothing stimulating or informative about this piece.  There are countless studies of UFOs which offer cogent, believable evidence of extraterrestrial or multidimensional visitors, but this weak little piece of propaganda completely overlooks everything that has been offered over the years to show that we are not alone.Instead they show whacko-fests, obviously faked photos and accounts of abduction and ignore every bit of honest research that has been done, not to mention the overwhelming number of photos and videos which cannot be explained.They just try to write everything off as the ramblings of idiots, pranks and hysteria.  It is an idiotic attempt to discredit phenomena which is clear and present in our daily lives, no matter how heavily the evidence is suppressed and distorted.I personally have seen three UFOs, all very different and all in extremely divergent places.  One was a small metallic ball over Rocky Flats plutonium trigger facility which hovered motionless for several minutes, then took off in a zig-zag pattern at amazing speed.  A friend I was hiking with also witnessed it.In 1997, I witnessed an immense UFO also in broad daylight in Sedona a week after the Phoenix Lights.  At that time, I had been camping in the desert, watching Hale Bopp and touring in a motor home, and had no knowledge of what had happened in Phoenix.  As soon as I saw the craft hovering overhead, I pulled over, grabbed a camera and jumped out of the motor home.  It had vanished completely, and I at first thought I'd seen an optical illusion.  However, when I looked back at the street, it was littered with vehicles that had stopped and people gazing dumfoundedly in the sky.The third sighting was in Denver in November of 2002.  I had gone out to watch a meteor shower with my dog, and we were playing in the backyard, throwing a toy.  It was about 3:00 AM and a beautiful, clear night sky.  I looked to the North and noticed what at first appeared to be a warp in the sky.  It was as if a wave was passing under the stars and I could see a ripple.  As it came closer, I realized the object was immense.  I can't tell you just how large, but I'm sure several football fields would have fit into its span.  It was absolutely silent, but always transparent.  When it was close to directly overhead, I could see seven glowing bumps or bulges spread across it.  I watched it over the course of at least ten minutes, which meant it was traveling at very slow speed.  The shape was not unlike a boomerang.  I have seen the same object in photos and videos on many real documentaries, and it could have been the same object as the Phoenix Lights, just less brightly lit.  There was nothing threatening about it.In 2005, while photographing a cemetery in October in Denver, I got several photos of a classic saucer.  One of them shows it near a passenger jet.  The object had moved little or not at all as I photographed the cemetery.  It was in the same place in the sky from several angles.  I did not see it until I got home and began processing the photos in Photoshop.If I, one person with reasonable intelligence have had all these experiences, which I have described, there have been thousands and thousands of other sightings by rational people and incredible evidence over millenia of visitations, possibly hybridizing of our distant ancestors, teaching of ancient civilizations in engineering and architectural projects which are beyond our abilities today...all this and far more...and yet these ""debunkers"" dwell on fringe-cases and con-artists, equate all sorts of varied phenomena which are only peripheral to actual sightings and other evidence of ancient visitations and current sightings.What a sham.  Of course, this was produced in 2005, at the height of governmental disinformation on myriad levels.  I wonder what the connection might be?",2,Weak Presentation and Unconvincing,1309478400,"07 1, 2011",2011,4221,"['documentary', 'barely', 'informational', 'level', 'seem', 'be', 'trying', 'disprove', 'existence', 'extraterrestrial', 'visitors', 'showing', 'viewer', 'most', 'absurd', 'easily', 'disproven', 'reports', 'faked', 'photos', 'videos', 'as', 'well', 'several', 'completely', 'irrelevant', 'departures', 'anything', 'actually', 'related', 'real', 'study', 'UFOs.There', 'was', 'nothing', 'stimulating', 'informative', 'piece', 'are', 'countless', 'studies', 'UFOs', 'offer', 'cogent', 'believable', 'evidence', 'extraterrestrial', 'multidimensional', 'visitors', 'weak', 'little', 'piece', 'propaganda', 'completely', 'everything', 'been', 'offered', 'years', 'show', 'are', 'not', 'show', 'whacko-fests', 'obviously', 'faked', 'photos', 'accounts', 'abduction', 'ignore', 'bit', 'honest', 'research', 'been', 'done', 'not', 'mention', 'overwhelming', 'number', 'photos', 'videos', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'explained.They', 'just', 'try', 'write', 'everything', 'off', 'ramblings', 'idiots', 'pranks', 'hysteria', 'idiotic', 'attempt', 'discredit', 'phenomena', 'clear', 'present', 'daily', 'lives', 'matter', 'how', 'heavily', 'evidence', 'suppressed', 'distorted.I', 'personally', 'have', 'seen', 'three', 'UFOs', 'very', 'different', 'extremely', 'divergent', 'places', 'One', 'was', 'small', 'metallic', 'ball', 'Rocky', 'Flats', 'plutonium', 'trigger', 'facility', 'hovered', 'motionless', 'several', 'minutes', 'then', 'took', 'off', 'zig-zag', 'pattern', 'amazing', 'speed', 'friend', 'was', 'hiking', 'also', 'witnessed', 'it.In', '1997', 'witnessed', 'immense', 'UFO', 'also', 'broad', 'daylight', 'Sedona', 'week', 'Phoenix', 'Lights', 'time', 'had', 'been', 'camping', 'desert', 'watching', 'Hale', 'Bopp', 'touring', 'motor', 'home', 'had', 'knowledge', 'what', 'had', 'happened', 'Phoenix', 'As', 'soon', 'saw', 'craft', 'hovering', 'overhead', 'pulled', 'over', 'grabbed', 'camera', 'jumped', 'motor', 'home', 'had', 'vanished', 'completely', 'first', 'thought', ""'d"", 'seen', 'optical', 'illusion', 'However', 'when', 'looked', 'back', 'street', 'was', 'littered', 'vehicles', 'had', 'stopped', 'people', 'gazing', 'dumfoundedly', 'sky.The', 'third', 'sighting', 'was', 'Denver', 'November', '2002', 'had', 'gone', 'out', 'watch', 'meteor', 'shower', 'dog', 'were', 'playing', 'backyard', 'throwing', 'toy', 'was', 'about', '3:00', 'AM', 'beautiful', 'clear', 'night', 'sky', 'looked', 'North', 'noticed', 'what', 'first', 'appeared', 'be', 'warp', 'sky', 'was', 'wave', 'was', 'passing', 'stars', 'could', 'see', 'ripple', 'came', 'closer', 'realized', 'object', 'was', 'immense', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'just', 'how', 'large', ""'m"", 'sure', 'several', 'football', 'fields', 'would', 'have', 'fit', 'span', 'was', 'absolutely', 'silent', 'always', 'transparent', 'When', 'was', 'close', 'directly', 'overhead', 'could', 'see', 'seven', 'glowing', 'bumps', 'bulges', 'spread', 'watched', 'course', 'least', 'ten', 'minutes', 'meant', 'was', 'traveling', 'very', 'slow', 'speed', 'shape', 'was', 'not', 'boomerang', 'have', 'seen', 'same', 'object', 'photos', 'videos', 'many', 'real', 'documentaries', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'same', 'object', 'Phoenix', 'Lights', 'just', 'less', 'brightly', 'lit', 'was', 'nothing', 'threatening', 'it.In', '2005', 'photographing', 'cemetery', 'October', 'Denver', 'got', 'several', 'photos', 'classic', 'saucer', 'One', 'passenger', 'jet', 'object', 'had', 'moved', 'little', 'not', 'all', 'photographed', 'cemetery', 'was', 'same', 'place', 'sky', 'several', 'angles', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'got', 'home', 'began', 'processing', 'photos', 'Photoshop.If', 'one', 'person', 'reasonable', 'intelligence', 'have', 'had', 'experiences', 'have', 'described', 'have', 'been', 'thousands', 'thousands', 'other', 'sightings', 'rational', 'people', 'incredible', 'evidence', 'millenia', 'visitations', 'possibly', 'hybridizing', 'distant', 'ancestors', 'teaching', 'ancient', 'civilizations', 'engineering', 'architectural', 'projects', 'are', 'abilities', 'today', 'far', 'more', 'yet', 'debunkers', 'dwell', 'fringe-cases', 'con-artists', 'equate', 'sorts', 'varied', 'phenomena', 'are', 'only', 'peripheral', 'actual', 'sightings', 'other', 'evidence', 'ancient', 'visitations', 'current', 'sightings.What', 'sham', 'course', 'was', 'produced', '2005', 'height', 'governmental', 'disinformation', 'myriad', 'levels', 'wonder', 'what', 'connection', 'might', 'be']",N/A
905709,A213KQ65OELF7R,B0009HMTFI,Commander Adama,"[20, 28]","One of the problems which confronts anyone who wants to seriously study the UFO phenomenon is learning which books and documentaries on the subject can be trusted, and which books and documentaries are done by con artists or ""true believers"" who take obviously fake UFO stories or videos and claim they're the ""real thing"". Sadly, the ""sham"" UFO documentaries tend to greatly outnumber the reliable ones. However, this marvelous UFO documentary - created by the A&E; Network - is probably the single best documentary I've ever seen on the subject of UFOs. Narrated by Michael Dorn (who played the Klingon ""Worf"" on ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"") and released in 1997, it was also released on VHS under the title of ""UFOs: Encounters and Abductions"". The video's strengths lie in the superb history of the UFO phenomenon it offers to viewers. It starts with the first famous UFO sighting in America in 1947 (and it wasn't Roswell). In June 1947, a private pilot named Kenneth Arnold spotted nine disk-shaped objects flying near Mt. Rainier in Washington State; his sighting was given wide publicity and is considered the starting point of the UFO phenomenon in America. This documentary offers some rare audio footage from a radio interview Kenneth Arnold did a few days after his sighting. The documentary then examines in-depth the famous ""Roswell UFO Crash"", and traces the major UFO sightings since the 1940's. It explores the US Air Force's top-secret ""Project Blue Book"" investigation into UFOs in the fifties and sixties, and looks at the modern ""crop circles"" and ""alien abduction"" phenomena. The documentary even explores UFOs as a pop-culture fad, and gives the viewer an amusing look at the self-proclaimed ""contactees"" of the fifties - they were people who claimed to be in contact with friendly, humanoid ""Space Brothers"" who wanted to save the Earth from nuclear war (some of these people were simply con artists; others were, well, just weird).The documentary also explores some scientific theories which could explain some UFO-related phenomena, such as ""Earthlights"", which are caused by stress along earthquake faults, and ""sleep paralysis"", which could explain some ""alien abduction"" stories. What makes this documentary particularly reliable is its admirable emphasis on balance - it includes both the UFO ""believer"" and UFO ""skeptic"" viewpoints. The documentary features interviews with some of the best-known and most respected ""Ufologists"" and skeptics. Jerome Clark, Dr. Kevin Randle, Dr. Mark Rodeghier, and Dr. Michael Swords are all prominent ufologists who are featured, and among the skeptics is Curtis Peebles, an aviation historian for the Smithsonian Institution. Peebles argues that just as fairies or witches were the myths of earlier historical eras, so UFOs are a ""modern myth""; naturally the ufologists disagree and offer their views and assessments. If you're interested in watching a truly serious, balanced, and well-made study of the UFO phenomenon, then ""Where Are All The UFOs?"" is easily one of the best documentaries you can buy.

I liked it because it presented two sides: evidence for extraterrestrial visits and evidence against. It's actually not as common as one might think to find a documentary that does this. There is discussion into methods of both investigating UFO's and Alien Abductions as well as methods to fake these. What this does is allow the viewer to engage in actual critical analysis.I myself am open to the idea of Alien visitation. That being the case, there were examples that, to me, were obvious figments of one's imagination and other things that I really had to scratch my head on. That's what I like. I like it when I feel the need to engage my brain instead of experiencing a highly one-sided, mind-numbing presentation.

It was actually copyrighted in 1996.The producers, in order to make their case picked and chose what went into this DVD very carefully.  And it's heavily biased toward making believers look crazy.As an example they went back in the archives from the 1950s and dug up video from every deep fringe lunatic they could find.  It's almost as if they went straight to the asylum to interview these crack-pots.Throughout the DVD they chose photographs and home movies that are easily debunked.  The really obvious stuff--cooking pots on the end of fishing poles and cut-outs stuck to windows and photogrphed.For crop circles they found those two guys from England who made a few of the original crop circles with boards and ropes, and stopped their investigation right there.  This was their final answer to ALL crop circles.And as for the abductee cases; they said it was all caused by the earth emitting electromagnetic charges which interact with the human brain to create an other-worldly effect.  And that most abductees live in the middle of New York City (rooftop abductions and what not).  If anything, I must say that's an original theory.Much has happened since 1996.  NASA has released a lot of UFO video from space and much has been captured on home video.  Not to mention all the credible witnesses that have come forward.If you really want  good UFO DVD then find yourself a copy of one titled OUT OF THE BLUE.  It's outstanding!
