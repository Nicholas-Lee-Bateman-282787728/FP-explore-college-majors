806160,A3JLKDUV0B6O5U,B0001I54N4,TFR,"[1, 2]","The video quality of this production is excellent; however, the original quality of the subject matter is primitive.  Most of this stuff is in black and white.  Only the Hollies and the Yardbirds cuts are in color, and the Hollies' cut is very grainy, for lack of a better word.  The Yardbirds here are the ""Little Games"" Version.  Keith Relf lip syncs ""Heart Full of Soul"" with Jimmy Page finger-syncing Jeff Beck's guitar work.  The end result is that it looks phony.Biggest disappointment of this dvd: The Kinks live performance of ""You really got me"".  The video is mostly head shots, and does not show the band at work.  Ray Davies' head and face occupies most of the video.  It would appear that the whole thing was probably shot with one or maybe two cameras.Biggest Surprises:  The Troggs music video, ""Wild Thing"".  It's creative, and it holds up well.  Gerry and the Pacemakers' ""How Do You Do It"" is also a live performance worth watching, because the camera work is pretty good and it shows that the lead singer was also an exceptionally talented rhythm guitarist.Most of the other stuff, like songs by the Animals, Joe Cocker and Peter and Gordon are lip-synced.  It was difficult to call Procol Harum or Traffic - could be either live or pre-recorded.  In particular, the video of Procol Harum was probably shot in existing light and it's too dark to identify some members of the band other than Gary Booker.My only other criticism is that there were too many needless still shots of historic people, place and things that took place during the the sixties.  These still images didn't add anything to the overall product and a good target for the fast-forward button on my remote.",3,Will be of interest to only the most die hard fans of sixties music...,1261526400,"12 23, 2009",2009,1694,"['video', 'quality', 'production', 'excellent', 'however', 'original', 'quality', 'subject', 'matter', 'primitive', 'Most', 'stuff', 'black', 'white', 'Only', 'Hollies', 'Yardbirds', 'cuts', 'are', 'color', 'Hollies', 'cut', 'very', 'grainy', 'lack', 'better', 'word', 'Yardbirds', 'here', 'are', 'Little', 'Games', 'Version', 'Keith', 'Relf', 'syncs', 'Heart', 'Full', 'Soul', 'Jimmy', 'Page', 'finger-syncing', 'Jeff', 'Beck', 'guitar', 'work', 'end', 'result', 'phony.Biggest', 'disappointment', 'dvd', 'Kinks', 'live', 'performance', 'really', 'got', 'video', 'mostly', 'head', 'shots', 'not', 'show', 'band', 'work', 'Ray', 'Davies', 'head', 'face', 'occupies', 'most', 'video', 'would', 'appear', 'whole', 'thing', 'was', 'probably', 'shot', 'one', 'maybe', 'two', 'cameras.Biggest', 'Surprises', 'Troggs', 'music', 'video', 'Wild', 'Thing', 'creative', 'up', 'well', 'Gerry', 'Pacemakers', 'How', 'Do', 'Do', 'also', 'live', 'performance', 'worth', 'watching', 'camera', 'work', 'pretty', 'good', 'lead', 'singer', 'was', 'also', 'exceptionally', 'talented', 'rhythm', 'guitarist.Most', 'other', 'stuff', 'songs', 'Animals', 'Joe', 'Cocker', 'Peter', 'Gordon', 'are', 'lip-synced', 'was', 'difficult', 'call', 'Procol', 'Harum', 'Traffic', 'could', 'be', 'live', 'pre-recorded', 'particular', 'video', 'Procol', 'Harum', 'was', 'probably', 'shot', 'existing', 'light', 'too', 'dark', 'identify', 'members', 'band', 'other', 'Gary', 'Booker.My', 'only', 'other', 'criticism', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'needless', 'still', 'shots', 'historic', 'people', 'place', 'things', 'took', 'place', 'sixties', 'still', 'images', 'did', ""n't"", 'add', 'anything', 'overall', 'product', 'good', 'target', 'fast-forward', 'button', 'remote']",N/A
