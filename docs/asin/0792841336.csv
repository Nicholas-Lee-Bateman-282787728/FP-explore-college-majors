A wheelchair-bound man who is sufffering from depression gets a scientifically altered monkey as a companion and helper...suddenly the man develops a renewed interest in life when the monkey steals his heart. But before long, science has hindered the progression of nature, and the monkey starts acting on its own animal instincts, ensnaring the man in a psychological battle of wills. The final half hour is edge-of-your-seat riveting; Romero did a splendid job balancing the drama and shocks with a fascinating insight in teh relationship between man and beast.

Regardless, it was not a bad film at all as it was a cross between Born on the Fourth of July and The Brood. The last half hour dragged a lot for me. The first 45 minutes or so were pretty good to see because the premise was very interesting to see, something I've not seen before. Moreover, the acting by the cast was very good and convincing. What I liked about the film were the underlying psychological issues. I actually thought that George Romero was a one-hit wonder, but he did extremely well with Monkey Shines.

Allan Mann (Jason Beghe) wouldn't know what to do without her. After Allan's accident left him paralyzed from the neck down, his girlfriend dumped him and ran off with the same doctor who botched Allan's surgery! Allan gave up on life at that point. Luckily, his best friend Geoffery (John Pankow) had an extra monkey (#6) in his genetics lab. He took her to a trainer and she learned quickly how to assist Allan and keep him company. Geoffery should have told Allan that the monkey, now renamed Ella, had been the subject of his brain-boosting experiments, and that she'd been injected several times with human brain serum. Oopsy! Ella and Allan get very attached to each other, seeming to have a near psychic bond. All is well until Allan's internal rage somehow jumps into Ella's tiny simian brain!

146393,A6DOCZ10B7JAJ,0792841336,"C. Christopher Blackshere ""Mackshere""","[1, 2]","Sorry George, I love ya, but what happened? Monkey Shines has an incredibly intelligent and unique premise. After a debilitating accident left him paralyzed, Allan Mann is introduced to Ella, a highly intelligent monkey. This animal has specialized training to help him adjust and cope with this drastic change in his lifestyle. It's a match made in heaven, Ella's skills and comprehensive abilities are extraordinary. But there is more to the story, of course. Ella has been injected with a special scientific formula, and the pair have unknowingly become part of an experiment. In the process they form an eerie bond, a possible telepathic link. Ella starts anticipating Allan's thoughts and acting out his subconscious desires. This soon turns violent, and the results are pretty frightening. The suspense builds steadily and provides some interesting subplots. Unfortunately though it gets a little too far-fetched and ridiculous. When this cute little monkey goes on a killing rampage, I couldn't help but shake my head. It made me wonder how a younger Romero might have handled the climax, possibly toned it down some. Maybe current audiences aren't much for subtlety, but I think this could have been one of the greats.

146394,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,0792841336,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[3, 5]","For some reason every time I see anything having to do with monkeys I think of that episode of The Simpson's where actor Troy McClure (you may remember me from such films as...) marries Homer's sister-in-law Selma in a sham wedding and then appears in a musical play titled `Stop the Planet of the Apes I want to get off!', singing the following lines...Troy: [singing] 'I hate every ape I see,From chimpan-a to chimpan-zee,No, you'll never make a monkey out of me'But I digress...Monkey Shines (1988) is a film adapted for the screen and directed by horror maven George A. Romero (Night of the Living Dead, Martin), who, incidentally, has a new `dead' film coming out sometime in 2005 titled Land of the Dead.  Starring in Monkey Shines is Jason Beghe, who I first saw on the HBO series `1st and Ten' way back in the mid 80's and has gone on to appear in such films as Maid to Order (1987), and G.I. Jane (1997) before settling into a career of forgettable TV movies.  Also appearing is John Pankow (To Live and Die in L.A.), Kate McNeil (The House on Sorority Row), Joyce Van Patten (Bone, The Bad News Bears), Christine Forrest, who just happens to be married to the director, Stephen Root (Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story), Stanley Tucci (The Core, Shall We Dance), and Janine Turner (Cliffhanger).As the movie begins we see a young couple nekkid in the bed, and we get half a bum shot of Janine Turner which is then ruined (for me at least), by a lengthier bum shot of Beghe (for this we should have had partial breastage shot from Turner...missed opportunities...oh well).  Anyway, the man, named Allan, who is quite fit, begins what appears to be his daily morning jog, only to find himself on the losing end of a face to grill meeting with a truck, thus beginning Allan's new life as a quadriplegic.  Adjusting to a life of near immobility is certainly difficult (so much so for the once active Allan), and not made better by the departure of his hot girlfriend (wait to you see who she trades up to).  Allan's friend Geoffrey Fisher (Pankow), who is also a medical scientist working at the university Allan attended before the accident, sees that his friend is having difficulties, and arranges for one of the Capuchin monkeys from his lab to be trained by Melanie Parker (McNeil), an expert in the field of training helper monkeys for the disabled.  Thing is, Geoffrey's experimentation involves trying to increase the brain power of primates (developing the cognitive skills) by injecting them with serum partially comprised of frozen human brain shavings have not met with the level of success he was hoping for, that is until Ella (the monkey) is paired with Allan, and its discovered that the formula may have worked too well causing a mind meld of sorts between primate and human.  This connection allows for a number of things, but it also unleashes some very primal instincts in Allan, ones that Ella begins acting on, and soon people begin to die...I enjoyed this film, despite my thinking it was just a tad too long.  If you are expecting loads of gore based on the fact that this is a Romero film, you are going to be disappointed and should probably skip this one.  It's listed as a horror/Sci-Fi film, but I think of it more as a semi-intellectual thriller.  The main problem I had with the film was I didn't care for the main character in Allan...now it's understandable his initial bitterness in coping with his injury as I would think the loss of usage of nearly all ones limbs would be a real downer, but what I am talking about goes beyond that in his treatment of those around him, especially his nurse and his mother.  Okay, the nurse was a slacker and complainer, but his harping on her didn't help...and his mother...she might have been a tad overbearing, but her heart seemed in the right place and her concern genuine.  Neither really deserved the verbal abuse they got from Allan.  Oh, wait, Allan's abusive nature stemmed from his close relationship with Ella, and the unleashing (perhaps transference) of primal furies...whatever...seemed to me Allan had more of an effect on Ella than she did on him.  Ella, after her training, existed only to serve and protect Allan, obeying his every command.  And something else I had a little problem with was the scientific credibility of Pankow's character.  His methods certainly left something to be desired and I hardly bought off on the notion that he was some sort of acclaimed researcher on the cutting edge of brain/intelligence studies.  The lack of scientific `veracity' doesn't break the film, but it could have been a little tighter...and why in the world would he donate his best test subject in such a manner?  I know he and Allan were friends, but come on now...here's another question for anyone who has seen the film...why did Geoffrey take two hypodermic needles (when only one was needed) with him prior to the final confrontation?  Other than it was a necessity for the plot?  Perhaps the 2nd hypo was a backup, but I'd doubt it as Pankow's impulsive and erratic character wasn't they type to think in terms of safeguards and backups...anyway...this was a case for me where the supporting more or less cast carried the film, as I never felt any real connection with Beghe or his character (too jerky for me).  He did well enough in the calm moments, but appeared too overwrought during the tense scenes.  I think my favorite characters, besides the monkey (who was quite expressive) was played by Forrest (the nurse), Van Patten (Allan's mother), and the arrogant Dr. Wiseman (Tucci).  One thing that puzzled me was the subplot with Geoffrey and his boss, Dean Burbage (Root).  Was that supposed to go anywhere?  Seems to me they could have cut those scenes out and saved about ten minutes or so...the real strength in the film lies in the direction as Romero does really well in setting scenes up and just creating and maintaining a general sense of suspense...the story may have been lacking in some areas, but the flow was generally strong, and the plot moved along, leading up to a dramatic finish.The picture on this DVD, available in both widescreen (1.85:1) and pan and scan, looks sharp and clear, and suffers no noticeable defects.  The Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround audio comes through well enough, but could use a little boost.  In terms of special features there really isn't much except for a short `collectable' booklet (what's so collectable about it?) and a theatrical trailer for the film.  All in all I'd give this 3  stars...Cookieman108By the way, it was stated no monkeys were harmed in the making of this film...it says nothing about budgies, though...and as far as the Simpson's reference I made earlier, I know the film is more akin to the episode where Homer got his own helper monkey named Mojo...",4,Deadtime for Bonzo...,1119312000,"06 21, 2005",2005,6817,"['reason',

146400,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,0792841336,General Zombie,"[2, 4]","I shoulda reviewed this like 2 weeks ago when I actually saw this film, so many of the details are getting a little fuzzy.  Still, the pertinent information remains, but I'll have to keep it short.'Monkey Shines' is one of the least popular titles in Romero's filmography.  It's certainly not one of his best, but when it gets going it's just obscenely fun and eccentric.  Problem is, the film isn't going all the time.  This movie is based on a high concept idea: 'Paralyzed man does battle with murderous helper monkey'  This is a wacky, amusing idea, and the scenes involving this scenario are... wacky and amusing.  But, this is only about the final 30 minutes of the film.  That's the big problem with this movie: too much padding, and too many subplots.  Hell, the monkey doesn't even kill anyone until an hour into the film.  Now I, being the easily amused sort, was always reasonably entertained throughout the film, but the fact is that it really does meander about a lot.  There are a number of subplots that go absolutely nowhere, specifically the one about the conflict between the main character's chemist friend and his department head, and the one about the strained relationship between him and his mother.  That and the setup of the main plot is a bit too prolonged.Again, however, once it gets going it's a total hoot.  Despite the fact that I generally find monkey's to be ugly, repulsive creatures, Ella is quite adorable, in her way.  She's kinda ugly, but her whole anthropomorphic manner is just great.  Now, it's nice to see an adorable little monkey scampering about and being friendly, but it's totally great too see a tiny monkey plot vengeance and death via it's beastly cunning and various monkeyous machinations.  Of course, this stuff isn't scary or even suspesnseful:  The idea of a tiny killer monkey is just too silly.  But, it works in it's own way.  Also, the film comes to a totally delicious and brilliant climax, which is followed shortly by a spectacularly awesome 'mandatory tacked on scare'.  I won't give away any specifics, it'll hurt the film too much.  But trust me, it's awesome.Entertaining stuff.

146401,A3FUBUJAIGM87T,0792841336,"HorrorMan ""HM""","[2, 6]","More of an off-beat sci-fi-thriller than a horror movie, ""Monkey Shines"" is about a man named Alan who is involved in a terrible accident and is consequently paralyzed.  After seeing how distraught Alan is, his friend, Jeff, decided to give Alan one of his lab monkeys that he was using to test some kind of secret serum he invented.The monkey, Ella, is very smart and takes a liking to Alan.  However, something strange begins to happen and so the title of this movie begins to make some sense.  After a while, Alan sees himself getting very angry and then bad things start happening. I wish I had a monkey like Ella.  She's the best character in this movie, but that's not saying much.Coming off his zombie movies and ""Creepshow"", George A. Romero attempted something a little bit different with ""Monkey Shines"", but was it effective?  The short answer of course is no.  About the only thing interesting to ""Monkey Shines"" is certainly not the story itself but rather the very convincing and effective acting by Ella, the monkey in this story and the best actor as well, although Beghe was adequate in his role.  It's really amazing the things that they were able to make this little monkey do. I will give them that much.  Ella deserved an oscar compared to the other uninspiring and insipid performances (aside from Beghe) given by the cast in this flick.However, while the monkey was entertaining at first, that's certainly not enough to make a good movie, much less a good and effective horror movie which ""Monkey Shines"" clearly is not.  While somewhat unique, ""Monkey Shines"" is very slow to develop, full of unnecessary scenes, and is rather unconvincing, uncompelling and uninteresting throughout the movie.  Marketed as a horror movie, ""Monkey Shines"" is actually more of an offbeat and ineffective attempt at a scifi-thriller movie.I was surprised by what I perceived to be a very lackluster, uninspiring and completely dysfunctional effort by Romero with ""Monkey Shines"".  Simply put, ""Monkey Shines"" is long, boring and leaves you feeling rather cheated and disappointed in the end because of the way they went with this movie.  I must admit that I had an idea of what this was going to be like going in, but I must admit that I expected more out of this than I actually got.By the time things start happening, the viewer has already become quite bored with the charm of Ella and her monkey business if you will because the movie is way too long for the amount of action that actually happens in this movie.  When things do begin to happen, not much is really shown.  The talents of Tom Savini were really wasted in this film.  Not sure why they even asked him to help.Incidentally, I remember this movie being rather unsuccessful at the box office, and so I never watched it until now.  I caught it on fearnet and I can certainly see why this movie has been unable to find much of a following, but I honestly cannot see why this movie found its way on to DVD.  I guess it just goes to show you how some good movies still have not find their way on to DVD, but there is plenty of assorted DVD trash like ""Monkey Shines"" to go around.""Monkey Shines"" is a very poor excuse for a horror movie, and I would not recommend it to anyone, unless you just love monkeys of course and even then this movie will leave with the proverbial ""bad taste in your mouth"".  Indeed, this movie basically sucks.As an interesting comparison, I think one can see a parallel between this movie and ""The Hand"" from psychological and paranormal perspectives.

Hoyos,"[3, 3]","Hard to believe that the man who directed zombie horror fests such as ""Night of the Living Dead,"" ""Dawn of the Dead,"" and ""Day of the Dead"" would bring us ""Monkey Shines"" - a tense, psychological horror masterpiece involving a genetically altered lab monkey that becomes psychotic.  The real star of this gem is Boo who plays Ella.  A nerdy researcher with delusions of grandeur keeps injecting poor Ella with memory cells from a human brain.  He then gives her to his best friend who has recently become a quadriplegic.  They become co-dependent to the max.  Soon the two become psychically linked.  As Ella becomes more intelligent, she also becomes more violent.  Soon she becomes the arms and legs for her owner and carries out his desire for vengeance against those who have harmed him.The acting is superb.  Jason Beghe (""One Missed Call"") gives an excellent performance as the handsome, athletic law student who become angry and bitter because of his crippling accident.  Beautiful Kate McNeil (""The Last House on Sorority Row"") is very convincing as the energetic, robust trainer of monkeys for the handicapped.  Together, Beghe and McNeil are a cute couple; their love scene is very sensual, proving that the handicapped can do most anything.  A young Stanley Tucci (""Maid in Manhattan"" and ""The Devil Wears Prada"") is a despicable neurosurgeon; who would've believed how handsome (and muscular) he was when he had hair.The gore is kept to a minimum.  ""Monkey Shines"" relies heavily on character development and a suspenseful, clever plot in which science has created a literal monster.  A quadriplegic becomes trapped within his home by a diabolical beast.  ""Monkey Shines"" is intelligent, well crafted science fiction horror with strong elements of romance and the supernatural.  The theme of anger becoming a physical manifestation is also prevalent in David Cronenberg's psychological masterpiece, ""The Brood""; it stars Samantha Eggar whose anger is physically manifested into killer dwarfs.I enjoyed ""Monkey Shines"" much more than George Romero's zombie films.  If you enjoy films about pets turning against their owners, then you may also want to watch ""Cujo"" or ""Man's Best Friend.""  There are many films involving genetically altered lower life forms such as bees, wasps, bats, etc., but none of them are as sophisticated or psychologically horrifying as ""Monkey Shines.""

This threw me off a bit. Apparently 'shining' means a kind of mental telepathy such as that displayed between the monkey in the film and Allan Mann (played by John Beghe).I likely also missed the fact that, in the monkey's murder spree here, she is acting out the unconscious desires of the man she serves. Never-the-less I liked the movie. I even thought the actor was really a quadriplegic (I can be a sucker for these things, I guess).The film is different and I liked the main character, the mad scientist character and the monkey itself.Towards the end it was just gratuitously violent.

His movies rely on atmosphere with a dash of special effects.  In this case, the horror comes from a (not so) innocent little monkey.  Well, the monkey is innocent, but the monkey's master is not.We start the movie off with a little bedroom action, which is really just a teaser to get you into the movie.  We see a little bit of skin as we meet Allan Mann (Jason Beghe) and Linda Aikman (Janine Turner).  We quickly learn that Allan is very fit, and he is quickly out on his morning jog, when he has a close encounter of the grill kind.  Unfortunately, such encounters end badly, and in this one Allan becomes a (nasty) quadriplegic.  Of course, going from a fit, macho man to a quadriplegic is sufficiently traumatic that it would upset nearly everyone, and Allan reacts to the situation quite badly.  He is helped down the road to rage by the departure of girlfriend Linda.Luckily for Allan he has a brilliant friend working at Allan's university, Geoffrey Fisher (John Pankow) and his brilliant friend arranges for Melanie Parker (Kate McNeil) to train a Capuchin monkey for Allan to use as a helper.  In many other movies we would see touching moments and in the end Allan would develop a cure of some incurable disease, or win a Nobel or Pulitzer Prize.  In a George Romero movie, something sinister is going to happen.  In this case the sinister is the experiments the Geoffrey has been performing on the normally harmless monkeys, experiments where Geoffrey injects human brain soup into them to try to increase their intelligence.  To this point Geoffrey has met with little success, but the pairing of Allan and monkey Ella (played by monkey Boo - seriously) turns out to be fortuitous, or not, depending on which character you are in the movie.It seems that this time the treatment has formed some sort of empathic bond between Ella and Allan.  The bond appears to work both ways.  Allan picks up on Ella's primal behavior, and Ella picks up on Allan's feelings of frustration, rage and revenge.  The empathy the two feel becomes increasing the feelings each have, and eventually Ella begins to act on Allan's feelings, with murder and mayhem being the result.This movie has its high points and its low points.  The movie is relatively bloodless, so if you are looking for a gore-fest you should probably move on.  The tension in the movie builds, but there is little actual surprise, except for the ending.  You can even figure out who will die because Romero makes most of the people who die deserving of death.  Indeed, one of the low points of this movie is how stereotypical the characters are.Some of the most annoying stereotypes are main character Allan, who likely was arrogant before he died, but now he has become what he probably previously looked down on.  So now he is taking out his frustrations on anyone and everyone.  Allan's mother Dorothy (Joyce Van Patten) was genuinely concerned about Allan, but I also thought she was a bit obnoxious (like mother, like son?).The worst character was probably Geoffrey Fisher.  I am not a big fan of scientists as portrayed by most movies because they are unbelievable.  Geoffrey was supposed to be a ""real"" scientist, but his behavior was most unscientific, particularly for someone who was supposed to be on the cutting edge of science.  Science is often made the scapegoat for these sorts of movies, when in reality it is some weirdo who thinks he is a scientist, but turns out to be psychotic.  You have to admit, turning a poor little monkey into a killer was brilliant.  Even more brilliant is how Geoffrey acted like he was surprised that the monkey was a vicious killer.I vacillated between 3 and 4 stars for this movie.  I wanted to give the movie 4 stars because of how well Romero filmed the scenes involving the monkey.  However, the stereotypes and overacting tended to push the movie down in my estimation.  Also, though I thought the ending had its good points, it also had its weaknesses.  Thus, though there are places in this movie that rise to the level of 4 stars, overall this movie comes in at a more solid 3 stars.",3,No Monkey's Uncle,1120089600,"06 30, 2005",2005,4212,"['George', 'Romero', 'knack', 'creating', 'suspenseful', 'horror', 'movies', 'using', 'very', 'little', 'way', 'anything', 'movies', 'rely', 'atmosphere', 'dash', 'special', 'effects', 'case', 'horror', 'not', 'so', 'innocent', 'little', 'monkey', 'Well', 'monkey', 'innocent', 'monkey', 'master', 'not.We', 'start', 'movie', 'little', 'bedroom', 'action', 'really', 'just', 'teaser', 'get', 'movie', 'see', 'little', 'bit', 'skin', 'meet', 'Allan', 'Mann', 'Jason', 'Beghe', 'Linda', 'Aikman', 'Janine', 'Turner', 'quickly', 'learn', 'Allan', 'very', 'fit', 'quickly', 'out', 'morning', 'jog', 'when', 'close', 'encounter', 'grill', 'kind', 'Unfortunately', 'such', 'encounters', 'end', 'badly', 'one', 'Allan', 'nasty', 'quadriplegic', 'course', 'going', 'fit', 'macho', 'man', 'quadriplegic', 'sufficiently', 'traumatic', 'would', 'upset', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'Allan', 'situation', 'quite', 'badly', 'helped', 'road', 'rage', 'departure', 'girlfriend', 'Linda.Luckily', 'Allan', 'brilliant', 'friend', 'working', 'Allan', 'university', 'Geoffrey', 'Fisher', 'John', 'Pankow', 'brilliant', 'friend', 'arranges', 'Melanie', 'Parker', 'Kate', 'McNeil', 'train', 'Capuchin', 'monkey', 'Allan', 'use', 'helper', 'many', 'other', 'movies', 'would', 'see', 'touching', 'moments', 'end', 'Allan', 'would', 'develop', 'cure', 'incurable', 'disease', 'win', 'Nobel', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize', 'George', 'Romero', 'movie', 'something', 'sinister', 'going', 'happen', 'case', 'sinister', 'experiments', 'Geoffrey', 'been', 'performing', 'normally', 'harmless', 'monkeys', 'experiments', 'where', 'Geoffrey', 'human', 'brain', 'soup', 'try', 'increase', 'intelligence', 'point', 'Geoffrey', 'met', 'little', 'success', 'pairing', 'Allan', 'monkey', 'Ella', 'played', 'monkey', 'Boo', 'seriously', 'out', 'be', 'fortuitous', 'not', 'depending', 'character', 'are', 'movie.It', 'time', 'treatment', 'formed', 'sort', 'empathic', 'bond', 'Ella', 'Allan', 'bond', 'work', 'ways', 'Allan', 'up', 'Ella', 'primal', 'behavior', 'Ella', 'up', 'Allan', 'feelings', 'frustration', 'rage', 'revenge', 'empathy', 'two', 'feel', 'becomes', 'increasing', 'feelings', 'have', 'eventually', 'Ella', 'act', 'Allan', 'feelings', 'murder', 'mayhem', 'being', 'result.This', 'movie', 'high', 'points', 'low', 'points', 'movie', 'relatively', 'bloodless', 'so', 'are', 'looking', 'gore-fest', 'should', 'probably', 'move', 'tension', 'movie', 'little', 'actual', 'surprise', 'ending', 'can', 'even', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'will', 'die', 'Romero', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'die', 'deserving', 'death', 'Indeed', 'one', 'low', 'points', 'movie', 'how', 'stereotypical', 'characters', 'are.Some', 'most', 'annoying', 'stereotypes', 'are', 'main', 'character', 'Allan', 'who', 'likely', 'was', 'arrogant', 'died', 'now', 'become', 'what', 'probably', 'previously', 'looked', 'down', 'So', 'now', 'taking', 'out', 'frustrations', 'anyone', 'everyone', 'Allan', 'mother', 'Dorothy', 'Joyce', 'Van', 'Patten', 'was', 'genuinely', 'concerned', 'Allan', 'also', 'thought', 'was', 'bit', 'obnoxious', 'mother', 'son', '.The', 'worst', 'character', 'was', 'probably', 'Geoffrey', 'Fisher', 'am', 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'scientists', 'portrayed', 'most', 'movies', 'are', 'unbelievable', 'Geoffrey', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'real', 'scientist', 'behavior', 'was', 'most', 'unscientific', 'particularly', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'cutting', 'edge', 'science', 'Science', 'often', 'made', 'scapegoat', 'sorts', 'movies', 'when', 'reality', 'weirdo', 'who', 'scientist', 'out', 'be', 'psychotic', 'have', 'admit', 'turning', 'poor', 'little', 'monkey', 'killer', 'was', 'brilliant', 'Even', 'more', 'brilliant', 'how', 'Geoffrey', 'acted', 'was', 'surprised', 'monkey', 'was', 'vicious', 'killer.I', 'vacillated', '3', '4', 'stars', 'movie', 'wanted', 'give', 'movie', '4', 'stars', 'how', 'well', 'Romero', 'filmed', 'scenes', 'involving', 'monkey', 'However', 'stereotypes', 'overacting', 'tended', 'push', 'movie', 'down', 'estimation', 'Also', 'thought', 'ending', 'had', 'good', 'points', 'also', 'had', 'weaknesses', 'Thus', 'are', 'places', 'movie', 'rise', 'level', '4', 'stars', 'overall', 'movie', 'more', 'solid', '3', 'stars']",N/A
146408,A1WMCX4CYZCYXE,0792841336,Mike,"[2, 5]","The first half hour of this movie is actually very promising. It lays the groundwork for an interesting psychological thriller based on the impotence and rage a male quadraplegic feels. It also accurately addresses a lot of the feelings and anxieties that are common to individuals facing this degree of disability. If it had stayed that way and developed from there on a psychological note, it probably would have been pretty decent, barring the fact Romero can't write dialogue that well.Instead, the story turns into Z-grade sci-fi and includes telepathy, lab experiments gone awry, long scenes of explanatory dialogue and an overtly ridiculous ending. What makes it worse is that it is incredibly boring and paced terribly with plenty of plot discursions that never go anywhere. I had to hit the fast forward button several times.It also fails miserably as a horror movie (which is shocking seeing as this was directed by Romero). There are virtually no death sequences, and they're bloodless. This movie should be rated PG or PG-13, at the worst.The biggest horror movie failure is the monkey. Whose idea was it to use a capuchin monkey as a villain? The things are absolutely adorable. It doesn't even have superpowers or anything. It's an ordinary monkey. It's really just not one of those things that inspires fear. Maybe they can make a kitten the big bad in the sequel.I found myself laughing uncontrollably throughout most of the last half hour of the movie. It has plot holes that you could sail the Titanic through. The climax is honestly one of the stupidest things I've ever seen on film. Trust me, you'll know it when you see it.Absolutely not recommended, unless you want clips related to quadraplegia from the first half hour. That's the only reason I gave it the two stars - in the half hour or so before the movie goes mind-numbingly stupid, it makes some nice visual points regarding disability.",2,Interesting premise mangled horribly,1233360000,"01 31, 2009",2009,1916,"['first', 'hour', 'movie', 'actually', 'very', 'promising', 'groundwork', 'interesting', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'based', 'impotence', 'rage', 'male', 'quadraplegic', 'feels', 'also', 'accurately', 'lot', 'feelings', 'anxieties', 'are', 'common', 'individuals', 'facing', 'degree', 'disability', 'had', 'stayed', 'way', 'developed', 'there', 'psychological', 'note', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'pretty', 'decent', 'barring', 'fact', 'Romero', 'ca', ""n't"", 'write', 'dialogue', 'well.Instead', 'story', 'Z-grade', 'sci-fi', 'telepathy', 'lab', 'experiments', 'gone', 'awry', 'long', 'scenes', 'explanatory', 'dialogue', 'overtly', 'ridiculous', 'ending', 'What', 'worse', 'incredibly', 'boring', 'paced', 'terribly', 'plenty', 'plot', 'discursions', 'never', 'go', 'anywhere', 'had', 'hit', 'fast', 'forward', 'button', 'several', 'times.It', 'also', 'miserably', 'horror', 'movie', 'shocking', 'seeing', 'was', 'directed', 'Romero', 'are', 'virtually', 'death', 'sequences', ""'re"", 'bloodless', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'rated', 'PG', 'PG-13', 'worst.The', 'biggest', 'horror', 'movie', 'failure', 'monkey', 'Whose', 'idea', 'was', 'use', 'capuchin', 'monkey', 'villain', 'things', 'are', 'absolutely', 'adorable', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'superpowers', 'anything', 'ordinary', 'monkey', 'really', 'just', 'not', 'one', 'things', 'fear', 'Maybe', 'can', 'make', 'kitten', 'big', 'bad', 'sequel.I', 'found', 'laughing', 'uncontrollably', 'most', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'movie', 'plot', 'holes', 'could', 'sail', 'Titanic', 'climax', 'honestly', 'one', 'stupidest', 'things', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'Trust', ""'ll"", 'know', 'when', 'see', 'it.Absolutely', 'not', 'recommended', 'want', 'clips', 'related', 'quadraplegia', 'first', 'hour', 'only', 'reason', 'gave', 'two', 'stars', 'half', 'hour', 'so', 'movie', 'mind-numbingly', 'stupid', 'nice', 'visual', 'points', 'regarding', 'disability']",N/A

146410,A2JEDX851ET4Y8,0792841336,"Pumpkin Toss ""Dearest""","[0, 0]","This movie could not be classifide as a horror film. More of a bizzare drama, which will not leave you with nightmares. Cujo (killer dog movie) put your nerves on edge, and the audience could never look at a giant dog the same way again. Same thing with the movie Jaws. However, monkey shine, though at times suspensful, monkeys will just be monkeys afterwards. Nothing much in the movie to really terrify a person concerning small primates. The acting was good enough, not the best, but not the worst I have ever seen.The ending is the most suspensful part, but at the same time (I'M ABOUT TO GIVE THE ENDING AWAY SO TURN YOUR HEADS AWAY UNLESS YOU WANT ME TO SPOIL IT FOR YOU!!!!!)it was also botched up.  Basically, the man bites the monkey's neck, and at first it's disturbing. However, after several seconds of watching a man growling, and thrashing a stuffed animal about in his teeth, became too comical. I started to laugh, but felt odd in doing so. I wasn't sure if the director was trying to add a strange comedy to the ending, or what?There is something very good about this film though, and it's more of a light drama then horror. I would recommend this movie for two types of people. The first, those who are brand new to horror, and want to ease into this genre. This movie would be perfect for a beginner, not too terrifying, but enough where it could scare a new-be. The second, would be a person who has seen it all, and wants something a little different. One thing I liked about this film was it had nothing to do with teenagers up in the woods screwing and druging. Even the monkey spin was refreshing...not another killer shark or monster sort of film...though it does have similar qualities. Almost like a mild mix of ""Jaws"" and ""Christin"" (killer car film). Jaws= killer animal that will not stop until it is dead, and Christin= crazy killer devotion to her owner.I can't say that I would buy this film...I'm not sure?

Now that's not funny but what is is that he had to move his chair with a straw joystick with his mouth. Steven Hawking's brother is a monkey scientist I guess with a cryogenically frozen human brain. He shaves off a piece of brain and boils it in some mountain lightning under a bunsen burner. And the result: Mr. Brannick. Ha ha no I'm just yankin ya. He injected a monkey with his serum that probably wouldn't do anything and it became Ella the evil genius monkey and super helper monkey to his invalid brother. When Alan first got home from the hospital and there's a big party in his honor. It kind of gets spoiled though when Alan's chick shows up with his doctor. Ouch. Bad move by those two because Ella and Alan's minds become one. So Alan has these weird ""dreams"" that he's running through the woods real low to the ground and swinging from trees and stuff when actually he's seeing what Ella does when she gets out of her cage and out the broken attic window. Just wait it gets even more b.Alan clearly has a lot of anger. He's pissed at his doctor and ex and his annoying nurse who hates the monkey. And he hates the nurse's bird who tried to peck his eyes out but there was nothing he could do to stop it. Ella knows all this so what does she do? Yeah she ices anyone who's done Alan wrong. Then things take a turn because the monkey scientist decides to give her more banana juice and Ella wants to take everybody out. She tosses a hair dryer in mom's bath. She injects the brother with something that kills him, then she goes after Alan. He lures her up by his face by saying ""Come on baby you know you're the girl of my dreams.""
