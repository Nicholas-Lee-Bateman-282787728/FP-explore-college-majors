1141302,A3092C7QM2WHQ6,B0013D8LNG,"charlie uniquely me ""iconoclast""","[0, 0]","Recently i read a review by Frank Rich in the New York magazine about a play in NYC called Clybourne Park. The article mentioned ""A raisin in the sun"", because the play is the basis for Clybourne Park, therefore, i was interested in seeing the movie.The book was written in 1959 pre Civil Rights Act of 1964.I assume when Ms. Hansberry wrote the book, the Dream for blacks was that someday, racial equality would be accepted as a norm. How wrong they were and is provable today with a token black president who is rendered ineffective by the predominantly white southern Republican congress.Anything that the President proposes, gets knocked down by the republicans, whose goal from the very onset was to destroy his chances of being an effective president and get re elected.The Youngers buy a house in a white neighborhood which was not too keen in having black neighbors. The association is willing to buy the house plus a premium. Walter had just lost most of the family's inheritance by a con man on a business venture. Walter NOT only lost his part but his sisters part, which was to pay for her Medical college. Everything that the Youngers had hoped for was destroyed.Walter towards the end of the movie, ""sees the light"", rants about accepting the offer Lindner is willing to make, sell the house with additional monies offered by ""the property owners association"".Now, the end is really close, my sister and I are rooting for Walter, he has become REAL, he is angry and he is clear headed. By selling the house there will be plenty of money left over, Everyone will be happy, no sense in trying to buy a house in a white neighborhood where you will be rejected anyway (in the real world).But is that the way the movie ended? Hell no! Walter decides to stay in the house that his mother had put a down payment on, because of pride! Pride is great in certain circumstances, but not here, you have to be practical and use common sense. Sell the house! Otherwise, The neighbors WILL make your life unpleasant.That to me would have been a happy ending. No such thing as altering human nature. people are not happy unless they have someone to feel superior to. To answer Rodney Kings' ""can't we all get along?"" the answer is NO! this country will be forever divided. That's reality.That is how i want the sequel to end.",3,Let's have a sequel,1340582400,"06 25, 2012",2012,2323,"['Recently', 'i', 'read', 'review', 'Frank', 'Rich', 'New', 'York', 'magazine', 'play', 'NYC', 'called', 'Clybourne', 'Park', 'article', 'mentioned', 'A', 'raisin', 'sun', 'play', 'basis', 'Clybourne', 'Park', 'therefore', 'i', 'was', 'interested', 'seeing', 'movie.The', 'book', 'was', 'written', '1959', 'pre', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'Act', '1964.I', 'assume', 'when', 'Ms.', 'Hansberry', 'wrote', 'book', 'Dream', 'blacks', 'was', 'someday', 'racial', 'equality', 'would', 'be', 'accepted', 'norm', 'How', 'wrong', 'were', 'provable', 'today', 'token', 'black', 'president', 'who', 'rendered', 'ineffective', 'predominantly', 'white', 'southern', 'Republican', 'congress.Anything', 'President', 'proposes', 'knocked', 'down', 'republicans', 'goal', 'very', 'onset', 'was', 'destroy', 'chances', 'being', 'effective', 'president', 'get', 're', 'elected.The', 'Youngers', 'buy', 'house', 'white', 'neighborhood', 'was', 'not', 'too', 'keen', 'having', 'black', 'neighbors', 'association', 'willing', 'buy', 'house', 'premium', 'Walter', 'had', 'just', 'lost', 'most', 'family', 'inheritance', 'con', 'man', 'business', 'venture', 'Walter', 'NOT', 'only', 'lost', 'part', 'sisters', 'part', 'was', 'pay', 'Medical', 'college', 'Everything', 'Youngers', 'had', 'hoped', 'was', 'destroyed.Walter', 'end', 'movie', 'light', 'rants', 'accepting', 'offer', 'Lindner', 'willing', 'make', 'sell', 'house', 'additional', 'monies', 'offered', 'property', 'owners', 'association', '.Now', 'end', 'really', 'close', 'sister', 'are', 'rooting', 'Walter', 'become', 'REAL', 'angry', 'clear', 'headed', 'selling', 'house', 'will', 'be', 'plenty', 'money', 'left', 'over', 'Everyone', 'will', 'be', 'happy', 'sense', 'trying', 'buy', 'house', 'white', 'neighborhood', 'where', 'will', 'be', 'rejected', 'anyway', 'real', 'world', '.But', 'way', 'movie', 'ended', 'Hell', 'Walter', 'stay', 'house', 'mother', 'had', 'put', 'down', 'payment', 'pride', 'Pride', 'great', 'certain', 'circumstances', 'not', 'here', 'have', 'be', 'practical', 'use', 'common', 'sense', 'Sell', 'house', 'Otherwise', 'neighbors', 'WILL', 'make', 'life', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'happy', 'ending', 'such', 'thing', 'altering', 'human', 'nature', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'happy', 'have', 'someone', 'feel', 'superior', 'answer', 'Rodney', 'Kings', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'answer', 'country', 'will', 'be', 'forever', 'divided', 'reality.That', 'how', 'i', 'want', 'sequel', 'end']",A Raisin in the Sun

Rossi,"[1, 2]","While I had been aware of the fact that a stage production revival had been underway, i didn't know that a new version of the movie had been made. Now, I am a serious fan of Sidney Poitier and know that his finest performance was in RITS, lets give credit here, Sidney Poitier is one of the greatest actors ever, and it is his own greatness that in RITS was his downfall. It is difficult to suspend disbelief and see Poitier as the downtrodden worker-for-the-man that RITS expects him to be. It's like trying to envision Tom Cruise as an every-man mechanic in the new War of the Worlds, you just can't stomach it. Enter Sean 'P-Diddy' Combs. Here we have a hip hop star whose credibility even as a music artist seemed bleak at best, let alone his trying out one of the toughest dramatic roles of all time. But to me, Sean does the job and then some. Here is the passionate man who just wants a break to be something better. He is convinced that he is made for greatness and thanks to Sean's portrayal, there is never room for doubt in my mind that this character has had it rough his whole life. The three women are absolutely amazing as has been said and the production itself with its' jittery camera work gives you a view of this family as though you were right there with them as a visitor in their house.

The meaning behind the story is what really counts, and how each character portrayed their roles to bring the story to light was beyond good it was exceptional.  I remember seeing Ms Rashad on Oprah right before the movie aired and the scene where she finds out that her son gave the money away, was superb. Oprah asked her where did she go in that scene, and she said she went way back to slave women and their struggles, and i went right there with her.  Not many movies affect me emotionally, but that scene really got to me. that was acting at its finest!  it made me think about how hard my husband works to help keep our bills paid and to enjoy our life, but this womans husband worked hard to keep food on the table and a roof over their heads. he suddenly dies, and because of his hard work he was able to provide some security in case of his untimely deaf. his wife seizes an opportunity to become a homeowner and put her husbands hard work to good use, and her son blows it on a fluke.  that was painful!",4,Bravo for Phylicia Rashad!,1234656000,"02 15, 2009",2009,1276,"['am', 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'people', 'are', 'trying', 'compare', 'movie', 'version', 'stage', 'play', 'do', ""n't"", 'compare', 'maybe', 'point', 'however', 'Phylicia', 'Rashad', 'Saana', 'Latham', 'Ms.', 'McDonald', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', '1st', 'name', 'i', 'would', 'have', 'given', '3', 'stars', 'meaning', 'story', 'what', 'really', 'how', 'character', 'portrayed', 'roles', 'bring', 'story', 'light', 'was', 'good', 'was', 'exceptional', 'remember', 'seeing', 'Ms', 'Rashad', 'Oprah', 'right', 'movie', 'aired', 'scene', 'where', 'out', 'son', 'gave', 'money', 'away', 'was', 'superb', 'Oprah', 'asked', 'where', 'did', 'go', 'scene', 'said', 'went', 'way', 'back', 'slave', 'women', 'struggles', 'i', 'went', 'right', 'there', 'Not', 'many', 'movies', 'affect', 'emotionally', 'scene', 'really', 'got', 'was', 'acting', 'finest', 'made', 'think', 'how', 'hard', 'husband', 'help', 'keep', 'bills', 'paid', 'enjoy', 'life', 'husband', 'worked', 'hard', 'keep', 'food', 'table', 'roof', 'heads', 'suddenly', 'hard', 'work', 'was', 'able', 'provide', 'security', 'case', 'untimely', 'deaf', 'wife', 'opportunity', 'become', 'homeowner', 'put', 'husbands', 'hard', 'work', 'good', 'use', 'son', 'fluke', 'was', 'painful']",A Raisin in the Sun

Sometimes it flops, but at other times it shines in a way not like the original but stands alone as a fine production. Such is what happens with Kenny Leon's revival of Lorraine Hansberry's ""A Raisin in the Sun,"" which is a new version for a new audience while still remaining faithful to the original play. Having just seen again the original 1961 movie I was all set to not like the 2008 film. Not to worry. Mr. Leon has every reason to be proud of his work here. The three women are exceptional. Phylicia Rashad as the matriarch of the Younger family brings a youthfulness to the character of a woman still very much engaged in life and seeping with quiet strenth. Audra McDonald becomes the charcter Ruth, and Sanaa Lathan as Beneatha literally shines as the young twenty-year-old so full of ambition and hope for a better life. While Sean Combs is no Sidney Poitier and is not always completely believable as Walter, he redeems himself in the climatic scene when he delivers his ""we just want to be good neighbors"" speech to John Stamos, the spokesman for the white neighborhood where the Younger family will be moving to shortly.There are nice touches added to this film not in the original version, if you have to compare the two. There are more scenes outside of the cramped, claustrophobic apartment where much of the action takes place. Additionally the voice over of Morgan Freeman reading the Langston Hughes poem ""A Raisin in the Sun"" is beautiful.Incuded with the DVD is a version of the film with running commentary by Mr. Leon as well as interviews with practically everyone connected with the film. Much is made by all of them that this is a classic, that it is all about living one's dreams, the ability to love, etc., etc., etc., all of which is true. But there is an elephant in the room that these folks are too kind to mention: that at the heart of this movie is the ugly word ""racism."" Unfortunately too many white people in this country still do not want a black family moving into their neighborhood.""A Raisin in the Sun"" is in the same league as other American classics: ""A Streetcar Named Desire, ""Death of A Salesman"" and ""Long Day's Journey into Night.""

I wanted to see this because I knew of the story, liked the look of the cast and because I knew how acclaimed this is.  I really enjoyed it.I thought acting by ALL was very good and Sean Combs was very good in it; almost like he's an actor rather than music mogul.  Phylicia Rashad stole the movie - she played his mother and the scene where she finds out that her late husbands money has all gone, was amazing.  I've always known her to be a comic actress and yet this performance was superb.  John Stamos has a small role where he plays a nerdy (played well) white guy who is trying to deter the family from moving into a white neiborhood.As the dvd cover says on the back - ""Dreams can make a life worth living, but they can also be dashed by bad decisions"".  This is mostly what the movie is about.  But how the family pull together to still give themselves a better life is the true lesson.As I said, I cannot compare this version to anything else, but I really enjoyed it and thought it was done very well and acted well by everyone.

I don't know why I couldn't get into Sanaa Lathan's acting before, but it took me a long time to get into her, too. I liked ""Love & Basketball"" but that was about it. However, she won me over with ""Something New."" I wasn't familiar with Audra McDonald or Justin Martin, and as much as I liked Sean Patrick Thomas in ""Barbershop"" I always picture him in that corny ""Save the Last Dance"" movie. But being unfamiliar with actors or not liking them in other movies never stopped me before. And dammit, it's Phylicia Rashad. I think I've seen every single film, television show or musical performance she's ever been in. (Besides ""The Cosby Show,"" my favorite is ""Polly."") I was looking for a movie to watch this weekend and it was on my queue so I finally gave in.All of my previous opinions about the actors I mentioned went right down the drain (minus Rashad because clearly I like her) while watching this. I loved this film. Diddy did a far better job of acting than I expected him to. (I hated ""Monster's Ball"" so that doesn't count.) For the actors I didn't know about, they all did exceptional work. I liked Sean Patrick Thomas as a semi-smarty pants in this film, too, and Sanaa's character just cracked me up. She was trying her damnedest (and way too hard) to impress the African man (played by David Oyelowo) she was interested in dating.For a film to be over 2 hours long, it's GOT to be interesting and this movie kept my attention the entire time. I'd never seen the first film so this was my first experience with the plot, and I liked it so much that I want to see the original with Sidney Poitier. I cringed during the porch scene because I knew it was going to play out the way it did, but I respected Oyelowo's scene shortly after when he talked about people making excuses for their pitfalls.

1141320,AXHMUN6GC0WEH,B0013D8LNG,"The Fancy One ""blackprincess""","[8, 13]","I saw this when it aired on ABC in February, and I was really disappointed. This was the same cast that had revived this legendary play on Broadway a few years ago and it supposedly got good reviews.  However, I felt this television production was lacking a lot of things - namely the passion and intensity that was so prevalent in the classic 1961 film.  Something about this entire production felt a little ""off"" to me. It wasn't terrible, but I was left with the impression that the cast, good as it was, couldn't really connect to the roles they were playing and were basically sleepwalking through the entire movie.I expected more from Phylicia Rashad, who is a wonderful actress, as matriarch Lena Younger - she was the main reason why I decided to tune in in the first place. But even she was lackluster, and that was a surprize, since the Lena role is one that is formidably powerful. Audra McDonald (Ruth) and Sanaa Lathan (Beneatha) are both exceptionally good actresses, but watching this, they were just okay. Also Beneatha's appearance in this production totally contradicts the person she claims to be (someone who says she isn't an ""assimilationist"" wouldn't wear her hair any other way but natural - but then, one could argue that Diana Sands didn't wear her hair natural in the 1961 version, either). Parts of the story where the emotion should have been explosive and moving just fizzled out or wasn't there at all: For example, the scene where Walter's friend tells him that their buddy took off with their money - Walter's reaction is so low key, it's almost as if he shugged it off. The same thing goes for when Walter has to break the news to his family. They show a little more trepidation than Walter does, but not by much.Sean ""Diddy"" Combs, or whatever name he is calling himself this week, is no Sidney Poitier or Danny Glover (who reprised the role of Walter Lee Younger in a TV movie that aired in the late '80s). I'm sorry, but Combs cannot act. I know he tried, but his performance simply was not believable, period. No one can deny that he is a solid hit-maker in the field of music and an successful enterpreneur - I give him props for that - but he leaves a lot to be desired as an actor. Just because he's been cast in other films and spouts a few lines that Poitier did in the original Broadway play and the movie doesn't make him ""great"" or even an actor. However, that depends on what you think qualifies as such. Those who feel that way need to watch the 1961 film and then redefine the word ""great"" in their vocabulary.Ultimately the blame for this lethargic production has to go to the director, who should have elicited more from his cast. I will say that the good thing about it was at least there was a modern cast with actors that most people of this generation have heard of. ""A Raisin In The Sun"" is a sensational play that will continue to resonate with audiences as the years go by, but it deserves to be performed with the passion that I'm sure Lorraine Hansberry would have wanted.",2,Where is the EMOTION??,1207440000,"04 6, 2008",2008,3032,"['saw', 'when', 'aired', 'ABC', 'February', 'was', 'really', 'disappointed', 'was', 'same', 'cast', 'had', 'revived', 'legendary', 'play', 'Broadway', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'supposedly', 'got', 'good', 'reviews', 'However', 'felt', 'television', 'production', 'was', 'lacking', 'lot', 'things', 'namely', 'passion', 'intensity', 'was', 'so', 'prevalent', 'classic', '1961', 'film', 'Something', 'entire', 'production', 'felt', 'little', 'off', 'was', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'was', 'left', 'impression', 'cast', 'good', 'was', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'connect', 'roles', 'were', 'playing', 'were', 'basically', 'sleepwalking', 'entire', 'movie.I', 'expected', 'more', 'Phylicia', 'Rashad', 'who', 'wonderful', 'actress', 'matriarch', 'Lena', 'Younger', 'was', 'main', 'reason', 'why', 'decided', 'tune', 'first', 'place', 'even', 'was', 'lackluster', 'was', 'surprize', 'Lena', 'role', 'one', 'formidably', 'powerful', 'Audra', 'McDonald', 'Ruth', 'Sanaa', 'Lathan', 'Beneatha', 'are', 'exceptionally', 'good', 'actresses', 'watching', 'were', 'just', 'okay', 'Also', 'Beneatha', 'appearance', 'production', 'totally', 'person', 'be', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'assimilationist', 'would', ""n't"", 'wear', 'hair', 'other', 'way', 'natural', 'then', 'one', 'could', 'argue', 'Diana', 'Sands', 'did', ""n't"", 'wear', 'hair', 'natural', '1961', 'version', 'Parts', 'story', 'where', 'emotion', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'explosive', 'moving', 'just', 'fizzled', 'out', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', 'example', 'scene', 'where', 'Walter', 'friend', 'buddy', 'took', 'off', 'money', 'Walter', 'reaction', 'so', 'low', 'key', 'almost', 'shugged', 'off', 'same', 'thing', 'when', 'Walter', 'break', 'news', 'family', 'show', 'little', 'more', 'trepidation', 'Walter', 'not', 'much.Sean', 'Diddy', 'Combs', 'name', 'calling', 'week', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'who', 'reprised', 'role', 'Walter', 'Lee', 'Younger', 'TV', 'movie', 'aired', 'late', ""'80s"", ""'m"", 'sorry', 'Combs', 'can', 'not', 'act', 'know', 'tried', 'performance', 'simply', 'was', 'not', 'believable', 'period', 'one', 'can', 'deny', 'solid', 'hit-maker', 'field', 'music', 'successful', 'enterpreneur', 'give', 'props', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'actor', 'Just', 'been', 'cast', 'other', 'films', 'few', 'lines', 'Poitier', 'did', 'original', 'Broadway', 'play', 'movie', ""n't"", 'make', 'great', 'even', 'actor', 'However', 'what', 'think', 'qualifies', 'such', 'who', 'feel', 'way', 'need', 'watch', '1961', 'film', 'then', 'redefine', 'word', 'great', 'vocabulary.Ultimately', 'blame', 'lethargic', 'production', 'go', 'director', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'elicited', 'more', 'cast', 'will', 'say', 'good', 'thing', 'was', 'least', 'was', 'modern', 'cast', 'actors', 'most', 'people', 'generation', 'have', 'heard', 'Raisin', 'Sun', 'sensational', 'play', 'will', 'continue', 'resonate', 'audiences', 'years', 'go', 'be', 'performed', 'passion', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Lorraine', 'Hansberry', 'would', 'have', 'wanted']",A Raisin in the Sun
1141321,A36NF437WZLQ9E,B0013D8LNG,W. Powell,"[0, 1]","I watched this movie last night and the effects it had on me are still lingering through this morning.  Not only is it a wonderful film production and acting performance of a classic and timeless story written for the stage by Lorraine Hansberry, but its also a much needed reminder of what it takes to keep our dreams alive while staying true to the moral and religious values that helped carry generations before us through tougher times.My mother took us to see this play in NYC back in the 70's when I was about 10 year old.  I remember not understanding the different reactions of the grown-ups, I was more captivated by the experience of my first Broadway play and being inside a huge ornately decorated theatre. Watching the movie last night I now understand what all the sorrow, laughter, disappointment and triumph I saw on stage and throughout its audience of years past was all about. I now know why my mother was teary eyed afterwords.This story is simply about the passing of the torch from one generation to the next.  The torch comes with all the emotions of the past (both good and bad) as well as its hopes and dreams. Any people who've been immigrants to or experienced oppression in a land will relate to this story.I learned from watching this movie last night that what touched my mother so much in this story is that it represented her and my father's story, or any parent's story for that matter; for their children to attain all the dreams and hopes of their parents and generations past, dreams that have now become the children's dreams.  I also realized in watching that the obstacles and frustrations I've had to overcome are similar to those of my parents, maybe even inherited.So Now it is I who carry the torch and will someday, with teary eyes of joy, pass all the hopes, dreams, sacrifices and struggles to my children when the time is ripe.The message is clarified in this updated movie production. For if we don't pass on to the next generation our hopes and dreams along with the spiritual wisdom and moral guidance of past generations, all of it can simply ""dry up like a raisin in the sun, or fester like a sore and run.""A Must Watch!And for those reviewers who I feel are unjustly criticizing the acting of Sean Combs, try to remember, its not about the messenger as much as the message.
