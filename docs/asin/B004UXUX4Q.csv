1429005,A2FDFWRBCU8ERY,B004UXUX4Q,,"[0, 0]","George Clooney - in a very intense and meaningful performance - plays Matt King, a man who is forced to raise his two daughters alone and contend with a family legal matter after his wife is severely injured in a boating accident, comatose and unable to recover. King's family - he is Hawaiian descent - has ownership of a large plot of land in Hawaii. The rest of his relatives have gathered together to decide what to do with the land. Beau Bridges plays one of Matt's cousins. But, that's just the sidebar story. The real story is that Matt finds out his wife was having an affair, her lover was the one driving the boat when she had her accident. On his family trip to deal with his legal issue, Matt finds his wife's lover, who happens to be in Hawaii. Then, the story goes on from there. I found The Descendants to be a well acted, well scripted, and well made movie... but a bit slow and uneasy to watch in parts. While the drama is good, the story is not quite fluid and enlivened enough to hold my interest.  This is just my opinion... some may find the movie more enjoyable and worthwhile.",3,Somber intense drama but lags a bit,1351123200,"10 25, 2012",2012,1099,"['George', 'Clooney', 'very', 'intense', 'meaningful', 'performance', 'plays', 'Matt', 'King', 'man', 'who', 'forced', 'raise', 'two', 'daughters', 'alone', 'contend', 'family', 'legal', 'matter', 'wife', 'severely', 'injured', 'boating', 'accident', 'comatose', 'unable', 'recover', 'King', 'family', 'Hawaiian', 'descent', 'ownership', 'large', 'plot', 'land', 'Hawaii', 'rest', 'relatives', 'have', 'gathered', 'together', 'decide', 'what', 'do', 'land', 'Beau', 'Bridges', 'one', 'Matt', 'cousins', 'just', 'sidebar', 'story', 'real', 'story', 'Matt', 'out', 'wife', 'was', 'having', 'affair', 'lover', 'was', 'one', 'driving', 'boat', 'when', 'had', 'accident', 'family', 'trip', 'deal', 'legal', 'issue', 'Matt', 'wife', 'lover', 'who', 'be', 'Hawaii', 'Then', 'story', 'found', 'Descendants', 'be', 'well', 'acted', 'well', 'scripted', 'well', 'made', 'movie', 'bit', 'slow', 'uneasy', 'watch', 'parts', 'drama', 'good', 'story', 'not', 'quite', 'fluid', 'enlivened', 'enough', 'hold', 'interest', 'just', 'opinion', 'may', 'find', 'movie', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'worthwhile']",The Descendants
1429006,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B004UXUX4Q,,"[0, 0]","Matt King's (George Clooney) wife Elizabeth has been in a coma in the hospital for almost four weeks. She was involved in a boating accident. Also, Matt, one of several descendants of a Hawaiian princess, is the sole trustee of a family trust that controls over 25,000 acres of untouched land on the island of Kaua'i. Matt must decide for his family what is to be done with the land. At the same time, he's given the news that his wife will never recover and she has a living will, so all the machines will soon be unplugged and she will slowly die. So, Matt has to contact his in-laws and all of his wife's friends and notify them of his wife's impending death so that they can say farewell. In addition, Matt is getting used to raising his daughters, 10-year-old Scottie (Amara Miller) and 17-year-old Alex (Shailene Woodley) by himself. In the midst of all of this, Matt learns that his wife was having an affair for the past two years and decides to find Elizabeth's lover and inform him that she's dying so he can say farewell. Thus begins a mini-journey with his children (and a tag-a-long friend of his daughter, Alex) that brings his family closer together.The film has some really beautiful scenic shots, but when you're filming in Hawaii, that's not too difficult. The movie also features the finest performance of George Clooney's career. Even though Clooney has starred in lots of tv and film, he's best known for his good looks and comic ability (see O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU) and hasn't had many opportunities to display his range as an actor. THE DESCENDANTS gives him plenty of opportunities. It's his best role to date.THE DESCENDANTS also features the breakout performance of Shailene Woodley. Woodley is a young actress who hasn't had much exposure but THE DESCENDANTS will be her springboard to stardom. She displays the depth of emotion of a person who has lived several lifetimes.Beyond the fine acting, THE DESCENDANTS really doesn't offer much. Directed and co-written by Alexander Payne, the film has been nominated for and won all kinds of awards and has been listed on numerous critic's ""Best Of 2011"" lists. I think the main reason for this is because this is an Alexander Payne movie. Make no mistake, Payne is a talented director. I loved ELECTION and SIDEWAYS and even though I find ABOUT SCHMIDT incredibly depressing, it's also fascinating. However, THE DESCENDANTS lacks the life and personality that make those movies so interesting. There are a few really funny scenes in the movie (I don't know why, but watching Clooney run is hilarious), but there's nothing outstanding hilarious. Close to a third of the movie is told in voice-over from King. I don't have an issue with voice-over, but you can't overuse it and it has to be done correctly. THE DESCENDANTS abuses the voice-over. Also, the movie has way too many close-up shots. I realize that it's done for affect, but like the voice-over abuse, the close-up is used way too much in the movie. However, even putting these technical abuses aside, THE DESCENDANTS isn't good movie because it's really not that interesting of a story. The audience is glad to see how things turn out in the end, but it's almost an afterthought. I was looking forward to seeing THE DESCENDANTS, but much like the way I felt after seeing THE SOCIAL NETWORK in 2010 my reaction at the end of the movie was, ""That's it?""There's some great acting in THE DESCENDANTS, but overall the movie is a tale, ""full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.""",3,"Impressive Performances, But Not Much Else",1328140800,"02 2, 2012",2012,3510,"['Matt', 'King', 'George', 'Clooney', 'wife', 'Elizabeth', 'been', 'coma', 'hospital', 'almost', 'four', 'weeks', 'was', 'involved', 'boating', 'accident', 'Also', 'Matt', 'one', 'several', 'descendants', 'Hawaiian', 'princess', 'sole', 'trustee', 'family', 'trust', '25,000', 'acres', 'untouched', 'land', 'island', 'Kaua', 'i', 'Matt', 'must', 'decide', 'family', 'what', 'be', 'done', 'land', 'same', 'time', 'given', 'news', 'wife', 'will', 'never', 'recover', 'living', 'will', 'so', 'machines', 'will', 'soon', 'be', 'unplugged', 'will', 'slowly', 'die', 'So', 'Matt', 'contact', 'in-laws', 'wife', 'friends', 'notify', 'wife', 'impending', 'death', 'can', 'say', 'farewell', 'addition', 'Matt', 'getting', 'used', 'raising', 'daughters', '10-year-old', 'Scottie', 'Amara', 'Miller', '17-year-old', 'Alex', 'Shailene', 'Woodley', 'midst', 'Matt', 'wife', 'was', 'having', 'affair', 'past', 'two', 'years', 'find', 'Elizabeth', 'lover', 'inform', 'dying', 'so', 'can', 'say', 'farewell', 'Thus', 'mini-journey', 'children', 'tag-a-long', 'friend', 'daughter', 'Alex', 'family', 'together.The', 'film', 'really', 'beautiful', 'scenic', 'shots', 'when', ""'re"", 'filming', 'Hawaii', 'not', 'too', 'difficult', 'movie', 'also', 'finest', 'performance', 'George', 'Clooney', 'career', 'Even', 'Clooney', 'starred', 'lots', 'tv', 'film', 'best', 'known', 'good', 'looks', 'comic', 'ability', 'see', 'O', 'BROTHER', 'WHERE', 'ART', 'THOU', ""n't"", 'had', 'many', 'opportunities', 'display', 'range', 'actor', 'DESCENDANTS', 'plenty', 'opportunities', 'best', 'role', 'date.THE', 'DESCENDANTS', 'also', 'breakout', 'performance', 'Shailene', 'Woodley', 'Woodley', 'young', 'actress', 'who', ""n't"", 'had', 'much', 'exposure', 'THE', 'DESCENDANTS', 'will', 'be', 'springboard', 'stardom', 'depth', 'emotion', 'person', 'who', 'lived', 'several', 'lifetimes.Beyond', 'fine', 'acting', 'THE', 'DESCENDANTS', 'really', ""n't"", 'offer', 'much', 'Directed', 'co-written', 'Alexander', 'Payne', 'film', 'been', 'nominated', 'won', 'kinds', 'awards', 'been', 'listed', 'numerous', 'critic', 'Best', '2011', 'lists', 'think', 'main', 'reason', 'Alexander', 'Payne', 'movie', 'Make', 'mistake', 'Payne', 'talented', 'director', 'loved', 'ELECTION', 'SIDEWAYS', 'even', 'find', 'SCHMIDT', 'incredibly', 'depressing', 'also', 'fascinating', 'However', 'THE', 'DESCENDANTS', 'life', 'personality', 'make', 'movies', 'so', 'interesting', 'are', 'few', 'really', 'funny', 'scenes', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'watching', 'Clooney', 'run', 'hilarious', 'nothing', 'outstanding', 'hilarious', 'Close', 'third', 'movie', 'told', 'voice-over', 'King', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'issue', 'voice-over', 'ca', ""n't"", 'overuse', 'be', 'done', 'correctly', 'DESCENDANTS', 'voice-over', 'Also', 'movie', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'close-up', 'shots', 'realize', 'done', 'affect', 'voice-over', 'abuse', 'close-up', 'used', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'movie', 'However', 'even', 'putting', 'technical', 'abuses', 'aside', 'DESCENDANTS', ""n't"", 'good', 'movie', 'really', 'not', 'interesting', 'story', 'audience', 'glad', 'see', 'how', 'things', 'turn', 'out', 'end', 'almost', 'afterthought', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'THE', 'DESCENDANTS', 'much', 'way', 'felt', 'seeing', 'THE', 'SOCIAL', 'NETWORK', '2010', 'reaction', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'great', 'acting', 'THE', 'DESCENDANTS', 'movie', 'tale', 'full', 'sound', 'fury', 'signifying', 'nothing']",The Descendants

To be honest, I was never a fan of Clooney's earlier work. I just never thought he had real acting chops, it wasn't until I saw him in &#34;Up in the Air&#34; did I start to take notice. I truly feel Clooney should stick to dramatic roles and The Descendants is no exception. He is funny, naive, and completely charming as Matt King, a lawyer who's wife has been seriously hurt in a boating accident. Matt is not a hands-on kind of parent, his two young daugthers both have some emotional, behavorial problems and he must take the sole parent role when he gets news that his wife's condition is not improving. I also really liked Judy Greer in this film, she's so delightful and she has great chemistry with Clooney. I love this film, it's got some unexpected funny moments and it's also serious which are the kind of films that I found the most entertaining.

1429010,A36A9HWQ9U1IK4,B004UXUX4Q,"A. Jogalekar ""Curious Wavefunction""","[0, 0]","This is a good movie but I don't think it's a great movie. On the plus side, the performances are great. On the minus side, the story has several threads which never really converge. The impending death of Clooney's wife, the sale of his giant beach estate, his search for his wife's ex-lover, his difficult relationship with his kids; all these themes are explored with sensitivity, but they never manage to build up into an integrated picture.But what does stand above and beyond all this is the music. I have never listened to native Hawaiian music before and the soundtrack moved me so much that I promptly purchased it even before I finished watching the movie. I found that a lot of the pieces come from a famous islander named Gabby Pahinui. The music is just amazing; evocative, rustic and effectively conveying both bitter and sweet emotions (apt to the movie's themes). Most surprisingly, it made me nostalgic and wistful about a land I haven't even visited. It almost made me feel like I had lived in the state for years.Something has to be said about a movie soundtrack that's so good that it eclipses anything the movie has to offer. It doesn't mean that the movie is bad, it just means that the music is extraordinary.

Best Actor nominee George Clooney plays Matt King, a lawyer in Hawaii about to complete a significant family real estate deal when his wife suffers a boating accident that leaves her in a coma with no hope of waking. With his wife now hospitalized and on the verge of passing, Matt must reconnect with their two daughters, come to terms with the fact that his wife was unfaithful to him, and decide whether or not to go through with the land sale.

I am astonished that George Clooney was nominated for an Oscar for his performance, which consisted largely of running around looking tense or yelling at his teenaged daughters.  The plot was hopeful -- Clooney's character is part of a large clan that dates back to Hawaiian royal forbears and whose last big tract of virgin property must be sold or face bankruptcy, putting Clooney, as administrator, in a family fracas; and meanwhile he must face the fact that his comatose wife had been having an affair with a local man.  But not enough was done of this and at times when the film could really have dug in and had something to say, it grounds out in facile comedy instead.  While the film has its merits, including a wonderful turn by Beau Bridges as a dissolute clan member and excellent performances by the young actresses playing Clooney's daughters, the film is ultimately something of a fizzle--""Haole (white) as s--t"" says Clooney's character of his family's lifestyle at one point, and too much of that characterizes THE DESCENDANTS the movie as well.",3,Not up to the hype,1332374400,"03 22, 2012",2012,1133,"['DESCENDANTS', 'though', 'highly', 'praised', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'better', 'am', 'astonished', 'George', 'Clooney', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'consisted', 'largely', 'running', 'around', 'looking', 'tense', 'yelling', 'teenaged', 'daughters', 'plot', 'was', 'hopeful', 'Clooney', 'character', 'part', 'large', 'clan', 'back', 'Hawaiian', 'royal', 'forbears', 'last', 'big', 'tract', 'virgin', 'property', 'must', 'be', 'sold', 'face', 'bankruptcy', 'putting', 'Clooney', 'administrator', 'family', 'fracas', 'must', 'face', 'fact', 'comatose', 'wife', 'had', 'been', 'having', 'affair', 'local', 'man', 'not', 'enough', 'was', 'done', 'times', 'when', 'film', 'could', 'really', 'have', 'dug', 'had', 'something', 'say', 'out', 'facile', 'comedy', 'instead', 'film', 'merits', 'including', 'wonderful', 'turn', 'Beau', 'Bridges', 'dissolute', 'clan', 'member', 'excellent', 'performances', 'young', 'actresses', 'playing', 'Clooney', 'daughters', 'film', 'ultimately', 'something', 'fizzle', 'Haole', 'white', 's', 't', 'Clooney', 'character', 'family', 'lifestyle', 'one', 'point', 'too', 'much', 'DESCENDANTS', 'movie', 'as', 'well']",The Descendants

1429017,A1W9JOFE6F89FB,B004UXUX4Q,Amber MacDonald,"[1, 3]","To classify this movie in a specific genre would be impossible. At times I was laughing, at other times my eyes were filling with tears, some were tears of sorrow, some were teas of joy.George Clooney's character ( Matt King) is a member of a prominant family. He must enjoy law, because a mountain of family wealth is not enough to keep him from working as a layer. His life is complicated to say the least. His wife is in a critical coma, his daughters are his soul responsibility, and one is a teenager (Shaileen Woodley; ""Secret Life"") that seems to define rebellious. The other is younger and affected by her mother's health more than her sister. Matters are complicated again and again, and I'll leave out the details as there are a lot of spoiler-moments and I don't do that.The most important question: ""Is the movie any good?"" Well I can honestly assure you that it is. George Clooney always performs, and a seasoned director that seems born for this film allows all of the actors to shine. The storyline takes you on an unforgettable journey down what I can best describe as a ""smooth road"". Everything comes together seamlessly, and the movie feels both modern and somewhat classic.The movie is directed by Alexander Payne. If the name is not familiar to you, he was responsible for ""Sideways"" released in 2004, if you haven't seen that film, then this one will be a good ice-breaker to his style of directing. He is known for mixing elements of comedy, drama, and tragedy, and blending them to be oddly well-balanced. He succeeded in doing so in this movie and I believe it is his best work yet.Though there are some tear-jerking moments, and misfortune seems to be constantly looming presence, the movie is a long shot from being a full-blown tragedy or drama.The film flows nicely from scene-to-scene, even though those scenes can be night and day in contrast. My hubby doesn't care for either of those genres and he liked The Descendents. He called it ""well balanced"" and I couldn't agree more. This film could fit into any collection.

But, regardless, I gave it a try; and I'm happy I did. ""The Descendants"" is one of my absolute favorites of the year! The story is fresh and the acting is superb; Alexander Payne's directing is stellar! It's been a while since I've seen a film that hits all the right marks. Even though there is one small aspect to the film that was predictable, it doesn't subdue the effect of the film's message, nor does it take away from the overall excellence of the film itself. Thank goodness George Clooney chose this film after last year's disastrousThe American! And Shailene Woodley (the horrid ABC Family showThe Secret Life of the American Teenager: Volumes 1-6) dazzles in her first major movie role; I can't wait to see what she does next ... even though it will probably be some dopey teenage comedy. I especially liked the fact that Clooney portrays a father who was not always emotionally present in his family's life and now he is the one to take care of his two unruly daughters, both of whom he has no idea how to raise (welcome to the club of every father with two daughters).

When money is involved, family squabbles are always at their most tawdry.George Clooney plays Matt King, a lawyer based on Oahu with an attractive wife as well as two daughters aged 10 and 17.  His wife is involved in a tragic accident and becomes, essentially, a vegetable.  She is diagnosed never to regain consciousness.It is during this trauma that King learns that his much-adored wife had been cheating on him.  This comes a terrific shock.  He must manage this trauma while at the same time coming to a conclusion on a family inheritance that dates back to the time of Hawaiian annexation.  The decision involves hundred of millions of dollars and he has to balance the competing objectives of his various cousins who are all potential beneficiaries.Clooney plays the part magnificently.  He is a struggling parent who is trying to understand his daughters whilst simultaneously managing his own savaged emotions.  He is ably supported by a strong cast playing his daughters, the broader family and friends.  Clooney may well have played himself into an Oscar.

1429023,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B004UXUX4Q,Andrew Ellington,"[18, 37]","George Clooney.  I'll never understand the appeal.  I take that back.  I get it, to a degree, and I even buy into it, to a degree.  I just feel that the world, much like with Johnny Depp, is too late to this party.  I mean, back in the 90's, Depp was amazing.  When does the world take notice?  When he stars in that Disney `pirate' movie.  Back in the early aughts, Clooney was starring in quality films with varying subjects and smart directors who knew how to use him.  When does the world embrace him?  When he gets obnoxiously political and starts starring in a slew of pretentious films pretending to be smart.And I thought `Up in the Air' was bad.`The Descendants', as expected, was high on Oscar's radar.  They love Clooney now.  Sadly, this film is a complete misstep in that it just appears so surface; so miniscule.  It is trying to say so much about family and heritage and the preservation of both (literally and then again figuratively portrayed by the Hawaiian landscape).  Instead of getting into the heart of it though, `The Descendants' throws a slew of unlikable characters at us and expects us to weed through their flaws to find ourselves.  I've never in my life wanted to hit so many people.  Sadly, Alexander Payne forgot how to make movies.  I mean, `Sideways' and `About Schmidt', while not perfect, were really well done films  that haunted in certain ways.  With this film, Payne merely resorts to layering his ill-conceived drama with a bunch of poorly executed `monologues' that are supposed to amount to something in the end but wind up amounting to a lot of hot air.The film tells the story of Matt King, a lawyer who is trustee to a lot of beautiful land his family left to him and his cousins.  His cousins (or at least most of them) want to sell the land and make a fortune.  Matt is old school and believes in working for his money and so he deprives his family of an overtly rich life.  He has lost touch with his wife, who has been having an affair behind his back and planned on leaving him.  His eldest daughter is wayward and his youngest daughter is confused.  Oh, and his wife was in a severe accident and is on life support.  This obiovusly makes him reflect on his life and go soul searching (sort of) and blah blah blah.Shailene Woodley is rather excellent here, but the rest of the cast is so uneven.  Clooney is wooden and somewhat phones this in.  Amara Miller is annoying.  I wanted to run Nick Krause over with my car (seriously, a film trying to be this poignant should not resort to such depths of stereotypical clich&eacute;s).  What is Matthew Lillard doing in this movie?  Judy Greer seemed promising and then she had that ridiculous outburst in the hospital that made me laugh out loud.UGH, and this won an Oscar!  Seriously, the script is really skeletal and needed so much more fleshing out to make it feel well rounded.  Instead, this just became so faux important.  I hate that Clooney picks these films that attempt to be taken seriously but say so little about the subject they are pretending to know so much about.And if you have to basically read us the book through voice over narration during the film's opening ten minutes just to get us on track with the film then maybe you should rethink your scripting approach.",1,Washed out to sea...,1334275200,"04 13, 2012",2012,3282,"['George', 'Clooney', ""'ll"", 'never', 'understand', 'appeal', 'take', 'back', 'get', 'degree', 'even', 'buy', 'degree', 'just', 'feel', 'world', 'much', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'too', 'late', 'party', 'mean', 'back', '90', 'Depp', 'was', 'amazing', 'When', 'world', 'take', 'notice', 'When', 'Disney', 'pirate', 'movie', 'Back', 'early', 'aughts', 'Clooney', 'was', 'starring', 'quality', 'films', 'varying', 'subjects', 'smart', 'directors', 'who', 'knew', 'how', 'use', 'When', 'world', 'embrace', 'When', 'obnoxiously', 'political', 'starring', 'slew', 'pretentious', 'films', 'pretending', 'be', 'smart.And', 'thought', 'Up', 'Air', 'was', 'bad.', 'Descendants', 'expected', 'was', 'high', 'Oscar', 'radar', 'love', 'Clooney', 'now', 'Sadly', 'film', 'complete', 'misstep', 'just', 'so', 'surface', 'so', 'miniscule', 'trying', 'say', 'so', 'much', 'family', 'heritage', 'preservation', 'literally', 'then', 'again', 'figuratively', 'portrayed', 'Hawaiian', 'landscape', 'Instead', 'getting', 'heart', 'Descendants', 'slew', 'unlikable', 'characters', 'weed', 'flaws', 'find', ""'ve"", 'never', 'life', 'wanted', 'hit', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'Sadly', 'Alexander', 'Payne', 'forgot', 'how', 'make', 'movies', 'mean', 'Sideways', 'Schmidt', 'not', 'perfect', 'were', 'really', 'well', 'done', 'films', 'haunted', 'certain', 'ways', 'film', 'Payne', 'merely', 'layering', 'ill-conceived', 'drama', 'bunch', 'poorly', 'executed', 'monologues', 'are', 'supposed', 'amount', 'something', 'end', 'wind', 'up', 'amounting', 'lot', 'hot', 'air.The', 'film', 'story', 'Matt', 'King', 'lawyer', 'who', 'trustee', 'lot', 'beautiful', 'land', 'family', 'left', 'cousins', 'cousins', 'least', 'most', 'want', 'sell', 'land', 'make', 'fortune', 'Matt', 'old', 'school', 'working', 'money', 'so', 'family', 'overtly', 'rich', 'life', 'lost', 'touch', 'wife', 'who', 'been', 'having', 'affair', 'back', 'planned', 'leaving', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'wayward', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'confused', 'Oh', 'wife', 'was', 'severe', 'accident', 'life', 'support', 'obiovusly', 'reflect', 'life', 'go', 'soul', 'searching', 'sort', 'blah', 'blah.Shailene', 'Woodley', 'rather', 'excellent', 'here', 'rest', 'cast', 'so', 'uneven', 'Clooney', 'wooden', 'somewhat', 'Amara', 'Miller', 'annoying', 'wanted', 'run', 'Nick', 'Krause', 'car', 'seriously', 'film', 'trying', 'be', 'poignant', 'should', 'not', 'resort', 'such', 'depths', 'stereotypical', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'What', 'Matthew', 'Lillard', 'doing', 'movie', 'Judy', 'Greer', 'seemed', 'promising', 'then', 'had', 'ridiculous', 'outburst', 'hospital', 'made', 'loud.UGH', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Seriously', 'script', 'really', 'skeletal', 'needed', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'fleshing', 'make', 'feel', 'well', 'rounded', 'Instead', 'just', 'became', 'so', 'faux', 'important', 'hate', 'Clooney', 'films', 'attempt', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'say', 'so', 'little', 'subject', 'are', 'pretending', 'know', 'so', 'much', 'about.And', 'have', 'basically', 'read', 'book', 'voice', 'narration', 'film', 'opening', 'ten', 'minutes', 'just', 'get', 'track', 'film', 'then', 'maybe', 'should', 'rethink', 'scripting', 'approach']",The Descendants

1429025,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B004UXUX4Q,Andy Orrock,"[5, 8]","I'd read Kaui Hart Hemmings' excellent novel once I heard that it was Alexander Payne's newest project.  It seemed the perfect Payne vehicle: small enough to tell in whole without stripping out key parts (it's notable that Hart Hemmings' work started its life as a short story), featuring a flawed (though not deeply) protagonist at the heart of the story.  Piling this success on top of 'Election,' 'About Schmidt' and 'Sideways,' I can only say: this guy needs to work more.  I can't believe that he waited seven years after the brilliance of 'Sideways' to deliver another gem like 'The Descendants.'George Clooney has never been better than he is here as Matt King (though I thought his work in the title role asMichael Claytonwas superb).  He is (as widely quoted in the trailer) 'the backup parent.'  Now, with his family suddenly reeling from a tragic event, King is thrust to the forefront - primary caretaker of two daughters who grew up quickly under his nose - right at a critical professional juncture in which he needs to make a critical decision about his family's stake in large swathes of Hawaiian lands held under their trust and jurisdiction.  How King (and Clooney) handles those two rapidly evolving matters is the crux of the story.Whenever you read a book and then see the movie, you can't help but compare...What I liked...Shailene Woodley - She is stunningly good as older daughter Alexandra.  It's an awesome portrayal.  She's supposed to be model beautiful (check), a bit of a screw-up in her past (the movie gives a nod to that) and - to her father's surprise - a lot tougher and mature than he thought at event's outset.  In every scene with Clooney (and there are many of them), she's every bit his equal as a presenceHawaii - Hart Hemmings' is Hawaiian, so she doesn't spend a lot of time discussing what makes Hawaii Hawaiian.  Payne needs to do that for his wider audience.  He does so deftly - at the opening in King's voice over in which he tells you that living in Hawaii is not like living in paradise (they have their own concerns like everyone else), in a scene in which they go to look at their property ""for one last time,"" in the houses and neighborhoods he shows (most modestly middle class).  This is the Hawaii of its residents, not its tourists.Other casting nuggets - Laird Hamilton as Troy (sounding reedy and borderline pathetic as you would expect someone in that situation)...brilliant choice; author Hart Hemmings tucked into a little Easter Egg as Matt's secretary...loved that; Matthew Lillard (Shaggy!) as Brian Speer...an unexpected choice, but pulled off very well indeed (his frozen face when confronted with King is perfect); Judy Greer as Julie Speer (was Payne casting due to the name rhyming?)...always a scene-stealer in supporting roles, she's great here againPushing the the wife's story into the background - Here was the major script choice made by Payne: in the book, we come to know a lot more about Matt's wife (she's 'Joanie' in the book, 'Elizabeth' on screen).  We learn that she and Matt were vastly different.  The boating accident that put Joanie in the hospital is very representative of the way she lived her life: loud and and way up on the risk-o-meter.  One passage the stuck with me in the book.  A restauranteur tells him that he ""liked when Joanie came because her presence encouraged everyone to drink more.""  We learn about Joanie's personality in Matt's remembrances (the book is first-person from his perspective).  Payne could have done the same by going back in time and showing them together as a couple.  He chose not to do that.  I think the movie is better for it.  First, he's got two hours to tell a story that unfolded in print over almost 300 pages.  Second, the movie works better with Matt needing to go it alone...he can't be helped by his wife. Her near-lifeless presence brings that home.What I didn't like...Matt and Joanie/Elizabeth's relationship - They're depicted here as having been mutually unhappy (the words ""ask you for a divorce"" are mentioned at least three times).  In the book, it's more nuanced.  They were, right from the start, very different.  But Joanie ""always came home with me.""  It was a marriage of opposites that - despite what outsiders might have seen and felt - worked.  Or, rather, always had.  That's why the revelation about his wife and Speer stung so deeply.Sid - In the book, Alex's friend Sid is a steady stream of surprise to Matt.  He writes him off at the outset as shallow.  Turns out, he's anything but.  In movie, there's a hint of that.  In the book, it's better: it's Sid that calls Julie Speer to the hospital.  In the movie, Julie says she could ""smell it on [Brian]"" (after Matt and Alex's visit). In the book, she relates that ""Sid told me.  He called the house yesterday.""  Matt's response: ""Sid,"" I say.  Well.""  You can feel Matt's respect go up immensely with that one small scene.  I liked that Sid was instrumental in letting that key moment come to pass.All in all, those are small quibbles.  I heartily recommend this movie.",5,Another great film from Alexander Payne from an equally winning book,1322524800,"11 29, 2011",2011,5080,"[""'d"", 'read', 'Kaui', 'Hart', 'Hemmings', 'excellent',

From the Oscar nods to the well-woven movie trailer, The Descendants seemed like it would be a story that took you on a great journey of an estranged father reconnecting with his family after a tragic accident.  That seemed to happen in the first 30 minutes and then the film held one note for the next hour.  There were no real great personal discoveries, no real moments that tugged at the heart and connected you with these characters and the overarching backdrop of a family who were the Descendants of the first settlers in Hawaii and who owned all of this virgin Hawaiian land was just too predictable for me to be surprised at the end.It's not a bad movie, but it certainly doesn't deserve the crazy hype that it got either.  There are one or two really great lines in the film and then the rest of it is just vanilla.  It's a film about dealing with the loss of a family member taken too soon, but it's also a film about betrayal and anger...at least, it should have been.  Clooney, again, plays one note through the whole thing except for one tender moment near the end of the film.  His anger and frustration isn't consistent, his mellow temper towards his daughter's outbursts just makes his character as plain as a a white t-shirt.  Maybe that was the intent.  At the end of the film, I felt the same way about the guy and about the family as I did at the beginning of the film.  The only character development I really saw was the older daughter's surfer-dude friend.  He has some great scenes and some great moments in that film, but he is a bit character and not who the focus of the film was supposed to be about.Again, nothing against the film.  The acting was fine.  The script was okay.  The backdrop of Hawaii was nice...but I wanted something more.  I wanted more out of the character development and the overall story.  I wanted some real reactions and some real emotions that lasted longer than just one scene.  There is a great scene at the pool where the oldest daughter is told about her mother's condition and she submerges herself and cries underwater...but then, it doesn't phase her after that.Many of us have experienced the loss of people that we love and it IS a roller coaster of emotions and feelings, pain and joy, sorrow and madness...this film didn't go there and I wish it would have.  It would have been and could have been one of those films like Ordinary People or Forrest Gump.  Films that will endure because of how incredibly human they are.

Hawaiian liberationists, if any still remain, may groan at the pastel treatment of their music to lend local colour where the culture has otherwise been erased. But, despite that, the settings are beautiful and exotic, unusual for a US movie (surprisingly: why are US films set so seldom in Hawaii?), nicely suiting this off-beat story.Clooney's no Philip Seymour Hoffman, but in this role as a bereaved yet deceived husband he does very well - never overacting nor relying on his looks. On the contrary, aside from seeming helpless in the face of his lippy, near-feral daughters, he dares to look klutzy and way uncool while running flat-footedly to the neighbours' - nicely reflecting his character's distress and bewilderment (beaut directorial touch, that). Several other fine actors also give better-than-standard performances, each one in their own way adding to the subtle, mostly unpredictable string of scenes that result in this quirky narrative. They include Shailene Woodley as his elder daughter; her boyfriend, a half-witted but endearing lout who tags along to witness the proceedings, mostly providing (very) comic relief; the ever-reliable Robert Forster in a brief but meaty role as Clooney's cranky father-in-law; and the always charming Judy Greer, briefly adding a significant twinkle in the oddest scene of revenge you're ever likely to witness.Fine acting all around, often hitting just the needed notes to add up to a nicely-told, rather bizarre, not in the least commercial little story. In all, provided you're patient, you will see plenty of unforced poignancy and mercifully few moments of fake splash or presumed epiphany.Clooney is the obvious audience magnet for this film - but, as suggested, there's plenty besides him worth catching. I admit I like his fare, as I do Matt Damon's and Bruce Willis's: they make watchable movies. But when he gravitates toward projects like this, I know he's got something more than just entertainment and cash in mind. So, unless you crave only a jaw-punching, gun-toting George in action flicks that zip right along, this is recommended.",4,A quirky narrative told without affectation,1391472000,"02 4, 2014",2014,2171,"['Interesting', 'movie', 'played', 'solid', 'troupe', 'uncommon', 'setting', 'Hawaiian', 'liberationists', 'still', 'remain', 'may', 'groan', 'pastel', 'treatment', 'music', 'lend', 'local', 'colour', 'where', 'culture', 'otherwise', 'been', 'erased', 'settings', 'are', 'beautiful', 'exotic', 'unusual', 'US', 'movie', 'surprisingly', 'why', 'are', 'US', 'films', 'set', 'so', 'seldom', 'Hawaii', 'nicely', 'suiting', 'off-beat', 'story.Clooney', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'role', 'bereaved', 'yet', 'deceived', 'husband', 'very', 'well', 'never', 'overacting', 'relying', 'looks', 'contrary', 'aside', 'seeming', 'helpless', 'face', 'lippy', 'near-feral', 'daughters', 'look', 'klutzy', 'way', 'uncool', 'running', 'flat-footedly', 'neighbours', 'nicely', 'reflecting', 'character', 'distress', 'bewilderment', 'beaut', 'directorial', 'touch', 'Several', 'other', 'fine', 'actors', 'also', 'give', 'better-than-standard', 'performances', 'one', 'own', 'way', 'adding', 'subtle', 'mostly', 'unpredictable', 'string', 'scenes', 'result', 'quirky', 'narrative', 'include', 'Shailene', 'Woodley', 'elder', 'daughter', 'boyfriend', 'half-witted', 'endearing', 'lout', 'who', 'along', 'witness', 'proceedings', 'mostly', 'providing', 'very', 'comic', 'relief', 'ever-reliable', 'Robert', 'Forster', 'brief', 'meaty', 'role', 'Clooney', 'cranky', 'father-in-law', 'always', 'charming', 'Judy', 'Greer', 'briefly', 'adding', 'significant', 'twinkle', 'oddest', 'scene', 'revenge', ""'re"", 'ever', 'likely', 'witness.Fine', 'acting', 'often', 'hitting', 'just', 'needed', 'notes', 'add', 'up', 'nicely-told', 'rather', 'bizarre', 'not', 'least', 'commercial', 'little', 'story', 'provided', ""'re"", 'patient', 'will', 'see', 'plenty', 'unforced', 'poignancy', 'mercifully', 'few', 'moments', 'fake', 'splash', 'presumed', 'epiphany.Clooney', 'obvious', 'audience', 'magnet', 'film', 'suggested', 'plenty', 'worth', 'catching', 'admit', 'fare', 'do', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'make', 'watchable', 'movies', 'when', 'projects', 'know', 'got', 'something', 'more', 'just', 'entertainment', 'cash', 'mind', 'So', 'crave', 'only', 'jaw-punching', 'gun-toting', 'George', 'action', 'flicks', 'zip', 'right', 'along', 'recommended']",The Descendants
1429034,A25HYPL2XKQPZB,B004UXUX4Q,Bill Garrison,"[3, 5]","THE DESCENDANTS got a lot of press around awards time, and it deserved none of the accolades it received. I don't know if critics thought they had to like it since it came from Oscar winning director Alexander Payne, or if it was because it started Hollywood Golden Boy George Clooney, or if it because it had a nice, sweet, anti-business message. For whatever reason, critics got it wrong. It's unfortunate that this movie is a total bore, except for Sid (Nick Krause) and possibly Julie Speer (Judy Greer), the slacker boyfriend, because the story is a good one.The plot is simple. A man (Matt King, Clooney) is caring for his wife who is in a coma. He discovers she was cheating on him. She is going to die. King has to cope with losing his wife, and never getting to confront her about her cheating. He also gets a chance to meet the man who she was cheating with. The movie had all sorts of opportunities to create a story about forgiveness and reconciliation. Or, it could have gone darker and crafted a story of revenge and bitterness. Instead, it takes the approach of apathy. I'm not saying King or his two daughters (the non-entity Scotty, or the foul mouthed, cute 18-year old Alex) don't care about their mom or her cheating ways. I'm saying that the viewers have no reason to care. Perhaps one of the reason I cared so little is because of the stupid side story about the descendants. It seems King and his numerous cousins have descended from Hawaiian royalty and they face a big decision on who they should sell some property to and make millions. That story line added nothing to the plot.If this movie hadn't been lauded as one of the best of the year, I would have enjoyed it. Instead, I'm tired of watching movies Hollywood claims to be good and being bored out of my mind.  I remember reading a story about Matthew Lillard, who plays the man the wife cheats with, Brian Speer. It made it sound like his part mattered in the movie. But it didn't. He was hardly on screen at all. He didn't matter. Just like this movie.

1429035,A2NI9BFPKAFAZ0,B004UXUX4Q,Blago Jones,"[0, 0]","Pros: Let's be honest for a moment. You come to this movie for George Clooney, and if we're going to keep being honest, he's certainly worth the price of admission, suiting his best actor nomination nicely. But what may be surprising to some of you is the fact that his co-star, Shailene Woodley, does her part to keep pace with the much higher pedigreed Clooney. While other characters provide welcome comic relief and dramatic foils, Clooney's Matt and Woodley's Alex give the film a very human element with whom the viewer can't help but identify. Who would have thought we would be saying that about the first Batman with nipples (part of me feels bad for planting that thought in your head... but only part) and a chick most known for starring in modern teen soap operas?Aiding in the effort to get the viewers emotionally invested is a very deep immersion in the Hawaiian setting with the film's characters. From the stunning visuals to the quaint musical soundtrack to the constant bare feet, the movie brings the feel of Hawaii into the theater (well, I'm assuming this, since I've admittedly never actually been to Hawaii). In the end, you're left feeling as though you have actually experienced the events of the movie side by side with Matt and Alex.Cons: I know I just talked about how easy it is to identify with the main characters, but it's actually a little difficult to identify with a lawyer trust fund baby who lives in a tropical paradise and struggles with anything. *Coughfirstworldproblemscough*. Okay, so it's not quite so superficial as that, but you do still have to kick yourself every time you're reminded of the fact that, really, these people have it alright. Well, I didn't actually need to do any kicking of myself, because I was so busy enjoying the movie, but hopefully I just planted that thought into your head.Overall: Despite the plot revolving around a topic that traditionally makes me pretty uncomfortable, it's all actually a funny and enjoyable movie. The script made me breeze through the whole viewing, eagerly waiting to see what would happen to [us] next. On the other hand, while it is a fun to watch little movie, it isn't really all that special. Nothing about it stands out to me, and I'm pretty sure in five years I'll mostly just remember it for being nominated for best picture.

He and his family have inherited quite a bit of land for which Matt is the executor and they are in the process of selling it. The proceeds will go to Matt and his cousins. Despite having wealth, Matt has lived frugally, to the point where one might question his motives. His wife, Elizabeth, has just been severely injured in a boating accident and is comatose. It is unlikely that she ever will wake up and her living will is very explicit that she wants her life support pulled.Matt has two daughters, Scottie and Alex. Alex is 17 and a handful. As the film opens, she is in a private school that may also be a rehab facility. Scottie, about 10, is acting out at school and at home since her mother's injury. Matt is clueless about how to raise his two daughters alone and has been very distant from his family spending most of his time working at his law practice. The crisis with Elizabeth is forcing him to be a primary parent and the film is excellent in showing Matt's development as a father.Matt goes to the big island to pull Alex from school and bring her home. She is furious at her mother, having found out recently that she was having an affair. She tells her father and the two become co-conspirators in finding Joanie's lover and confronting him. Matt is flabbergasted about the affair. The marriage has not been going well but he had no suspicions that his wife loved another man.George Clooney is excellent in his part as are the two girls. The movie poignantly shows how the family starts pulling together into a semblance of a loving unit. The dialogue is fresh and real, not for the faint of heart or for those who mind cursing. I have not read the book so I can't compare the two but on its own merits, this film is a real winner.",5,A Poignant Depiction of a Family in Crisis,1323907200,"12 15, 2011",2011,2073,"['Descendants', 'movie', 'starring', 'George', 'Clooney', 'best', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year', 'adult-themed', 'realistic', 'poignant', 'dialogue', 'real', 'acting', 'superb', 'photography', 'Hawaii', 'spellbindingly', 'beautiful', 'story', 'Matt', 'King', 'descended', 'King', 'Kamehameha', 'many', 'generations', 'back', 'family', 'have', 'inherited', 'quite', 'bit', 'land', 'Matt', 'executor', 'are', 'process', 'selling', 'proceeds', 'will', 'go', 'Matt', 'cousins', 'having', 'wealth', 'Matt', 'lived', 'frugally', 'point', 'where', 'one', 'might', 'question', 'motives', 'wife', 'Elizabeth', 'just', 'been', 'severely', 'injured', 'boating', 'accident', 'comatose', 'unlikely', 'ever', 'will', 'wake', 'up', 'living', 'will', 'very', 'explicit', 'life', 'support', 'pulled.Matt', 'two', 'daughters', 'Scottie', 'Alex', 'Alex', '17', 'handful', 'film', 'private', 'school', 'may', 'also', 'be', 'rehab', 'facility', 'Scottie', 'about', '10', 'acting', 'out', 'school', 'home', 'mother', 'injury', 'Matt', 'clueless', 'how', 'raise', 'two', 'daughters', 'alone', 'been', 'very', 'distant', 'family', 'spending', 'most', 'time', 'working', 'law', 'practice', 'crisis', 'Elizabeth', 'forcing', 'be', 'primary', 'parent', 'film', 'excellent', 'showing', 'Matt', 'development', 'father.Matt', 'big', 'island', 'pull', 'Alex', 'school', 'bring', 'home', 'furious', 'mother', 'having', 'found', 'out', 'recently', 'was', 'having', 'affair', 'father', 'two', 'become', 'co-conspirators', 'finding', 'Joanie', 'lover', 'confronting', 'Matt', 'flabbergasted', 'affair', 'marriage', 'not', 'been', 'going', 'well', 'had', 'suspicions', 'wife', 'loved', 'man.George', 'Clooney', 'excellent', 'part', 'are', 'two', 'girls', 'movie', 'poignantly', 'how', 'family', 'pulling', 'together', 'semblance', 'loving', 'unit', 'dialogue', 'fresh', 'real', 'not', 'faint', 'heart', 'who', 'mind', 'cursing', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'two', 'own', 'merits', 'film', 'real', 'winner']",The Descendants

A few minutes too many of lyrical shots of the Hawaiian landscape, flowers, butterflies...to no purpose except to slow it down so that it was about 10 minutes too long.  The best parts were the two daughters of the George Clooney character:  terrific dialogue, convincing acting and realistic reactions.  Also good were the other supporting players - the older daughter's boy friend, the realtor, the realtor's wife.  I thought George Clooney was less wooden than he was in THE IDES OF MARCH (more on that elsewhere) and he came across as very likable.  What was not so convincing to me was that he  was doing an excellent job as trustee of his family's wealth, as a negotiator with sophisticated developers and as a lawyer.  Just a little too relaxed and off-key to provide any intensity - and, after all, his intensity in work is the reason he is so disconnected from his family at the beginning.  I also liked the travelogue-like bits about the non-touristy parts of Hawaii.Good movie; if you go with lesser expectations than I had from reading glowing readings, I think you'll like it better.

And all of this is added to the fact that you`ve really screwed up raising your kids, and that burden is now yours alone to bear.""The Descendants"" stars George Clooney, an actor increasingly proving his depth as a portrayer of wounded souls.  Here he is Matt King, a man who is getting pressured from all sides.  He is the sole trustee of a beautiful virgin Hawaiian lagoon that most of his numerous family line want to sell to a developer.  His is the deciding vote--and the trust will expire in seven years.First, however, must come his family, and to truly care for it he must give up his role as the ""back-up parent"" and learn how to deal with two foreign species: his two daughters, Scottie (10) and Alex (17).  Both need attention, as each is going in her own misguided direction.Scottie is acting out in school, texting inappropriate messages in school, including insults and disturbing photos of her dying mother, and Alex is at her expensive boarding school, drinking, carousing, and filled with unresolved anger toward her mother.  And she prefers to hang out with her friend Sid, a young surfer-type whose favorite word is ""dude.""Matt has a load on his shoulders that no one would want to bear, and in fact there is more going on than I've included here, as I don't want to provide ""spoilers.""  What is important now is his coming to terms with these problems, and doing so in a manner that will allow others to get on with their own lives.  There were times I cringed while watching, wondering if this movie was just too beleaguered to watch--but I'm very glad I stuck with it.That Matt's last name is ""King"" is no mistake; he is indeed the patriarch of the family when it comes to this trust, and his decision regarding it will not only affect those who live, but also those who have passed on--the trust consists of 25,000 acres of land that has been in the family ever since the early 1800s when it belonged to relatives who were actual royalty on the island of Kaua'i.""The Descendants,"" therefore, is an aptly named movie, and during this movie we will find out just how much this responsibility means to Matt.As I said, I found this at first to be a difficult movie to watch, but increasingly easier as the plot draws you in.  What especially works is the relationship Matt has with his older daughter, Alex, and her acceptance of her role as the matriarch, if you will.  She has things to work out on her own, and it is her growth that better enables Matt to hang on.  She has a directness to her that is initially off-putting, but becomes both comforting and compelling as time goes on, and is wise that her father listens to her...she becomes a worth ally.This is a thoughtful, gripping movie about love, and forgiveness, and anger, and redemption.  I found it to be smart but not too clever, and I believed in the characters and the story and the decisions that were ultimately reached.  I thought the acting was terrific, and apparently so did many others...especially those in charge of year-end awards.""The Descendants"" was either nominated for or won most key movie awards, from the Oscars to the American Film Institute to the Golden Globes and on and on.  It is a good film, extremely well made and heartfelt.

The film is about a middle aged man who is in crisis because he has life altering decisions and events to face.  This character is played by George Clooney.  Some people when faced with immense land holdings in one of the richest real estate markets on earth, Hawaii, would be wastrels.  Not him.  He is an attorney who supports himself even though he has final power in a trust that involes huge land holdings which came from the original family.  Although these descendants all look white now, way back on his maternal end, there was a full Hawiaan great grandmother who was the heiress,What he is facing is that all of his relatives want to sell the land and he has that power under the trust.  They do not. Also, his wife was in a boating accident, ended up in a coma and now lays dying in a vegatative state.  She has signed a living will which everyone is honoring. He has two daughters who also must be brought into the picture.  They think she's going to recover.In the midst of all of the above, his older daughter tells him his wife was having an affair.  He decides to find the guy and tell him what has happened.  The guy is a real estate agent who stands to make a fortune if the land deal goes through,None of this is played at a melodramatic level.  It unfolds as it would likely unfold in real life, mostly very quietly.  Clooney does a wonderful job.  This is where we all live at some point, where there are decisions and events that will follow us until our days wind down.There is a small role of the dying wife's father which is really fantastic.  Everyone has experienced this kind of person.  Given the bad news of his daughter's coming death, his sole reaction from there to the end is to lash out and blame everyone.else in the family.  He even makes the accident their faults although the wife was with someone else who was driving the boat at the time of her accident. He never lets up, just finds new ways to continue the attack on others as the day of death moves closer.This film has Oscar written all over it and I expect it to do very well at the Oscars.

1429070,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B004UXUX4Q,C. Sawin,"[10, 16]","I remember about seven years ago when video rental stores were still in their prime and I frequented Hollywood Video instead of Netflix when I picked up Sideways on a whim, brought it home, and thoroughly enjoyed it but never really had the chance to talk to anybody about it. It was long before I started reviewing movies and most of my friends have the typical guy taste in movies: if there isn't a ton of nudity, blood and violence, or explosion of some kind in the first ten minutes then they essentially get bored with it and fall asleep or turn it off without giving it a proper chance. So I kind of felt like I was this closet Sideways fan for years. Up until The Descendants, it was actually the only Alexander Payne directed film I've had the chance to see as well. With that said, I'm also not the biggest George Clooney fan. His pretentiousness in real life seems to have crossed over into many of his performances and my favorite memories from his acting resume are mostly Seth Gecko from From Dusk 'Till Dawn and Sparky and Dr. Gouache from ""South Park"". There have obviously been better movies of his since then (O Brother, Where Art Thou? Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, Up In the Air, and Fantastic Mr. Fox are personal favorites), but none have spoken to me the way Seth Gecko did. There has already been quite a lot of Academy Award talk with The Descendants, but Clooney's roles always seem to be associated with The Oscars so that wasn't too surprising. However The Descendants proved to not only be one of Clooney's best on-screen performances but is also one of the best 2011 has to offer.Visually speaking, The Descendants is extraordinary. It's filmed in Hawaii after all, so it's kind of difficult to make it look bad. The scenery is almost overly-beautiful even though much of the film is overcast Hawaii's green landscapes and clear ocean water makes nearly every scene visually striking. Even when it's raining you can't help but feel the urge to visit this amazing place or return there if you've been fortunate enough to have gone to Hawaii before. There's also a staircase scene where we're looking down at Clooney while he's climbing stairs that caught my eye while he narrates about his life which mostly revolves around trying to fix a broken marriage. It sounds so simple on paper, but it's one of those scenes where the camera was in the right place at the right time and makes something so brief memorable.This is easily the most emotional George Clooney has ever been in one of his performances, as well. He's on the brink of a breakdown the entire film and while I would've liked to have seen something a bit more expressive especially after the hype for ""his first on-screen breakdown,"" what we do receive is still really emotional and heartfelt. Shailene Woodley and Amara Miller are also fantastic as Matt King's (Clooney) children. They provide many of the laughs a good portion of the film and show they're also fully capable of displaying what feels like sincere sorrow and emotion. That's one of the best things about The Descendants; it provides plenty of hilarious laugh-out-loud moments but also isn't afraid to show you more tender moments that tug at your heartstrings. Alexandra's (Woodley) friend Sid (Nick Krause) is very entertaining, as well. His scenes in the car and at Elizabeth's (Patricia Hastie) parents' house are some of the greatest the film has to offer. Matt's friends Mark (Rob Huebel) and Kai Mitchell (Mary Birdsong) are also a highlight. Mark provides some really hilarious one-liners while Kai is obviously a very devoted friend to Matt's wife Elizabeth.There are little to no faults to be found in the film. The entire cast delivers, the story unravels in a very pleasing fashion, and the film is magnificently shot. There's very little to be unhappy with. Even the Hawaiian music was a high spot. While I'm not the biggest fan of foreign music, this was generally very soothing featuring Hawaiian lyrics accompanied by guitar or ukulele plucking. The one thing that might come off as kind of silly is the Matthew Lillard kitchen scene being fairly reminiscent of the ending to Scream, but that was more humorous than anything.I'm sure it differentiates a bit from critic to critic, but for me the best movies are not only the ones that feature talented casts, engrossing storytelling, and solid scripts but are also the ones that manage to affect a wide range of your emotions. The Descendants does all of that and then some. Every performance feels genuine and the never-ending downward spiral feeling the story gives you is resolved in a way that not only feels natural but is completely satisfying. This is George Clooney at his absolute best and it's safe to say that Alexander Payne has outdone himself. The Descendants is chaotic, charming, hilarious, and emotional. It's quite possibly the most powerful and emotion-evoking film of the year.",5,"Charming, hilarious, emotional",1321574400,"11 18, 2011",2011,4923,"['remember', 'seven', 'years', 'ago', 'when',

Tsao ""Seaview1""","[1, 4]","Alexander Payne has written and directed films (Sideways, About Schmidt) about men at unique crossroads in life and coming to grim, sobering realizations that cause a reevaluation of the past and an uncertain future.  In The Descendents, he focuses on a man's family dealing with grief and the hidden truths that threaten to tear it apart.  George Clooney is outstanding as a nave husband and father who must confront life after a terrible series of events.A water skiing accident in Hawaii has left a woman in a coma and her husband/lawyer, Matt (George Clooney), grief stricken and stunned by the news that she was having an affair with another man.  It seems that everyone knew about the affair but Matt who was too busy with his work to even notice, and he must come to terms with it and rebuild his family.  Matt's daughters are a troubled ten year old Scottie (Amara Miller) and his older teen, Alexandra (Shailene Woodley) who has a spacy boyfriend, Sid.  As the family realizes that their mom may never recover, they must make some major decisions, and Matt must find the truth even if it means confronting the man who stole her heart.  Meanwhile, Matt, as the primary trustee for the extended family, has an impending major land sale he must decide upon that could be a financial windfall for his relatives.  Determined to meet his wife's lover, Matt does some detective work and, with some help from his daughters, finally arranges to meet the object of his obsession which causes him to reassess his own life and his relationship with his daughters.This is Clooney's film all the way, and he gives a thoroughly convincing portrait of a man betrayed and oblivious to his wife and his family. He is not the handsome, dashing Clooney of Oceans 11 or Ides of March but rather an unglamorous fellow who is vulnerable. The pain and realization he emotes is heartfelt. Woodley lends excellent support as the knowing daughter who helps her father's quest.Through much of the story you wonder if Matt will exact some kind of revenge on the creep or do something impulsive.  That bit of tension only adds to an engaging plot.  In the end, Matt does the right things and brings closure for his family.  The final shot is great as Matt tries to become a dad again to his girls.  A major subplot involving the land deal gets even more complicated as surprising information is revealed when Matt investigates his wife's lover.  There are occasional moments of hilarity as when Matt is at the end of his rope and resorts to asking Sid for advice. It is a riot of a moment.There are good details which add to our understanding of Matt's family including his cranky father-in-law (Robert Forster) and a mother-in-law who has Alzheimer's disease.  What is special about a film like this is that each major character evolves through events and changed to a degree by the end (including spacy Sid).  That marks good character development.  These are not cardboard caricature but fully etched individuals with weaknesses like anyone, and our initial impressions about each are dispelled by film's end.The Hawaiian scenery is gorgeous but never used as a travelogue.  It merely sets the scene as did the wineries in Sideways and in some ways, the tropical paradise serves as counterpoint to the despair and angst that Matt must endure.You could imagine a Broadway version of this story since it relies more on characters and situation.  The film makes you care for and sustain interest in the main characters (brought to life by a strong cast) and what happens to them.  In the end, there is sadness and regret but also hope, the kind of hope that strengthens and bonds a family.",4,A Life in Retrospect in The DESCENDENTS,1330041600,"02 24, 2012",2012,3668,"['Alexander', 'Payne', 'written', 'directed', 'films', 'Sideways', 'About', 'Schmidt', 'men', 'unique', 'crossroads', 'life', 'coming', 'grim', 'sobering', 'realizations', 'cause', 'reevaluation', 'past', 'uncertain', 'future', 'Descendents', 'man', 'family', 'dealing', 'grief', 'hidden', 'truths', 'threaten', 'tear', 'apart', 'George', 'Clooney', 'outstanding', 'nave', 'husband', 'father', 'who', 'must', 'confront', 'life', 'terrible', 'series', 'events.A', 'water', 'skiing', 'accident', 'Hawaii', 'left', 'woman', 'coma', 'husband/lawyer', 'Matt', 'George', 'Clooney', 'grief', 'stricken', 'stunned', 'news', 'was', 'having', 'affair', 'man', 'everyone', 'knew', 'affair', 'Matt', 'who', 'was', 'too', 'busy', 'work', 'even', 'notice', 'must', 'come', 'terms', 'rebuild', 'family', 'Matt', 'daughters', 'are', 'troubled', 'ten', 'year', 'old', 'Scottie', 'Amara', 'Miller', 'older', 'teen', 'Alexandra', 'Shailene', 'Woodley', 'who', 'spacy', 'boyfriend', 'Sid', 'family', 'mom', 'may', 'never', 'recover', 'must', 'make', 'major', 'decisions', 'Matt', 'must', 'find', 'truth', 'even', 'confronting', 'man', 'who', 'stole', 'heart', 'Meanwhile', 'Matt', 'primary', 'trustee', 'extended', 'family', 'impending', 'major', 'land', 'sale', 'must', 'decide', 'could', 'be', 'financial', 'windfall', 'relatives', 'Determined', 'meet', 'wife', 'lover', 'Matt', 'detective', 'work', 'help', 'daughters', 'finally', 'meet', 'object', 'obsession', 'reassess', 'own', 'life', 'relationship', 'daughters.This', 'Clooney', 'film', 'way', 'thoroughly', 'convincing', 'portrait', 'man', 'betrayed', 'oblivious', 'wife', 'family', 'not', 'handsome', 'dashing', 'Clooney', 'Oceans', '11', 'Ides', 'March', 'rather', 'unglamorous', 'fellow', 'who', 'vulnerable', 'pain', 'realization', 'heartfelt', 'Woodley', 'excellent', 'support', 'knowing', 'daughter', 'who', 'father', 'quest.Through', 'much', 'story', 'wonder', 'Matt', 'will', 'exact', 'kind', 'revenge', 'creep', 'do', 'something', 'impulsive', 'bit', 'tension', 'only', 'engaging', 'plot', 'end', 'Matt', 'right', 'things', 'closure', 'family', 'final', 'shot', 'great', 'Matt', 'become', 'dad', 'again', 'girls', 'major', 'subplot', 'involving', 'land', 'deal', 'even', 'more', 'complicated', 'surprising', 'information', 'revealed', 'when', 'Matt', 'wife', 'lover', 'are', 'occasional', 'moments', 'hilarity', 'when', 'Matt', 'end', 'rope', 'resorts', 'asking', 'Sid', 'advice', 'riot', 'moment.There', 'are', 'good', 'details', 'add', 'understanding', 'Matt', 'family', 'including', 'cranky', 'father-in-law', 'Robert', 'Forster', 'mother-in-law', 'who', 'Alzheimer', 'disease', 'What', 'special', 'film', 'major', 'character', 'events', 'changed', 'degree', 'end', 'including', 'spacy', 'Sid', 'good', 'character', 'development', 'are', 'not', 'cardboard', 'caricature', 'fully', 'etched', 'individuals', 'weaknesses', 'anyone', 'initial', 'impressions', 'are', 'dispelled', 'film', 'end.The', 'Hawaiian', 'scenery', 'gorgeous', 'never', 'used', 'travelogue', 'merely', 'scene', 'did', 'wineries', 'Sideways', 'ways', 'tropical', 'paradise', 'serves', 'counterpoint', 'despair', 'angst', 'Matt', 'must', 'endure.You', 'could', 'imagine', 'Broadway', 'version', 'story', 'more', 'characters', 'situation', 'film', 'care', 'sustain', 'interest', 'main', 'characters', 'brought', 'life', 'strong', 'cast', 'what', 'end', 'sadness', 'regret', 'also', 'hope', 'kind', 'hope', 'strengthens', 'bonds', 'family']",The Descendants

1429074,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B004UXUX4Q,DanD,"[1, 3]","Matt King (George Clooney) is a wealthy land-owner in Hawaii, approaching a big land-sale deal.  At the same time, Matt receives word that his comatose wife has no hope of survival, and that by her own instructions, the plug is to be pulled.  Matt finds himself the guardian of a rebellious ten-year-old daughter (Amara Miller), and seeks out his other daughter, an equally rebellious teenager (Shailene Woodley).  The latter informs Matt that his wife was cheating on him, and while on a journey to inform her family of what is happening, Matt decides to seek out this other man.It's a rather complex plot, actually, layered with deep character development and details.  Director/screenwriter Alexander Payne holds everything together marvelously; this is a beautifully crafted, beautifully shot film.  What truly breathes life into THE DESCENDANTS, however, is Payne's way with his actors.  The film rests squarely on the shoulders of George Clooney; while at times ripping off his mannerisms from UP IN THE AIR (the narration doesn't help), Clooney ultimately delivers a very nuanced, very natural performance that probably deserved the 2012 Best Acting Oscar (but we all knew Jean Dujardin would win, didn't we?  Yes, we did.)  Woodley matches Clooney step-for-step, in what will be regarded as her breakthrough performance.  Miller also gives a solid performance (I've ranted about child actors before; there's no need to rant about Miller).  Robert Forster gives a memorable performance at Matt's father-in-law, while Matthew Lillard takes a nice dramatic turn as ""the other man"" (with Judy Greer as his wife).  Nick Krause provides some fantastic comedic moments as Sid, a teenage suitor.And that's the great thing about THE DESCENDANTS: even at its darkest, saddest moments, it doesn't forget to be funny.  Because humor can be found anywhere, and Payne and company aren't afraid to show you.  Some viewers may be put off by the fact that a movie about a family coping with death can be so funny in spots; but such is life.  Payne has found the perfect material, and the perfect cast, to create a tale of humor and tragedy.  It doesn't hurt that this is, quite simply, an amazing film.",5,"""How can they possibly think our families are less screwed up?""",1331596800,"03 13, 2012",2012,2193,"['Matt', 'King', 'George', 'Clooney', 'wealthy', 'land-owner', 'Hawaii', 'approaching', 'big', 'land-sale', 'deal', 'same', 'time', 'Matt', 'word', 'comatose', 'wife', 'hope', 'survival', 'own', 'instructions', 'plug', 'be', 'pulled', 'Matt', 'guardian', 'rebellious', 'ten-year-old', 'daughter', 'Amara', 'Miller', 'out', 'other', 'daughter', 'equally', 'rebellious', 'teenager', 'Shailene', 'Woodley', 'latter', 'informs', 'Matt', 'wife', 'was', 'cheating', 'journey', 'inform', 'family', 'what', 'happening', 'Matt', 'seek', 'out', 'other', 'man.It', 'rather', 'complex', 'plot', 'actually', 'layered', 'deep', 'character', 'development', 'details', 'Director/screenwriter', 'Alexander', 'Payne', 'everything', 'together', 'marvelously', 'beautifully', 'crafted', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'film', 'What', 'truly', 'breathes', 'life', 'THE', 'DESCENDANTS', 'however', 'Payne', 'way', 'actors', 'film', 'squarely', 'shoulders', 'George', 'Clooney', 'while', 'times', 'ripping', 'off', 'mannerisms', 'UP', 'IN', 'THE', 'AIR', 'narration', ""n't"", 'help', 'Clooney', 'ultimately', 'very', 'nuanced', 'very', 'natural', 'performance', 'probably', 'deserved', '2012', 'Best', 'Acting', 'Oscar', 'knew', 'Jean', 'Dujardin', 'would', 'win', 'did', ""n't"", 'Yes', 'did', 'Woodley', 'matches', 'Clooney', 'step-for-step', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'regarded', 'breakthrough', 'performance', 'Miller', 'also', 'solid', 'performance', ""'ve"", 'ranted', 'child', 'actors', 'need', 'rant', 'Miller', 'Robert', 'Forster', 'memorable', 'performance', 'Matt', 'father-in-law', 'Matthew', 'Lillard', 'nice', 'dramatic', 'turn', 'other', 'man', 'Judy', 'Greer', 'wife', 'Nick', 'Krause', 'fantastic', 'comedic', 'moments', 'Sid', 'teenage', 'suitor.And', 'great', 'thing', 'DESCENDANTS', 'even', 'darkest', 'saddest', 'moments', ""n't"", 'forget', 'be', 'funny', 'humor', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'anywhere', 'Payne', 'company', 'are', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'show', 'viewers', 'may', 'be', 'put', 'off', 'fact', 'movie', 'family', 'coping', 'death', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'funny', 'spots', 'such', 'life', 'Payne', 'found', 'perfect', 'material', 'perfect', 'cast', 'create', 'tale', 'humor', 'tragedy', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'quite', 'simply', 'amazing', 'film']",The Descendants

1429079,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B004UXUX4Q,Dennis Littrell,"[2, 3]","This is the fourth Alexander Payne movie I've seen and in some ways it is the best. It is the most affecting, that's for sure, at least for me. I cried through a good part of it. What I found so touching was the way the characters came to grips with the reality of their lives and in the way the King family--Matt (George Clooney), Alexandra (Shailene Woodley) and Scottie (Amara Miller)--strengthened their family ties despite the tragedy and the various unpleasant revelations.As Elizabeth King lies dying in a deep coma after a water skiing accident, it is her workaholic husband Matt who has to take care of a slightly dysfunctional family. He is the trustee of a great Hawaiian estate on the island of Kauai that now must be sold. Getting closer to his children he first learns that younger daughter Scottie's behavior needs a lot of work. Then he goes to the Big Island where his older daughter Alexandra is at school and finds her drunk. And then he learns... Well, it's better if you see the movie and see what she tells him that so sets him off.While this is almost as funny as the other Payne movies I've seen (Election 1999, About Schmidt 2002, and Sideways 2004) it is not as satirical. Payne reaches for our hearts in this one instead of our whimsy.Clooney is excellent in a part that emphasizes his controlled and very winning leading man style. He does a lot with restraint and subtle expressiveness. Woodley (just 19 as the film was shot) played the wiser-than-her-years teen with just enough edginess and spitfire to be believable. She is so pretty that just looking at her brought me to tears. But perhaps the most natural performance was that by Amara Miller as the foul-mouthed, chubby little girl who wants to be as grownup as her big sister.Interesting to me personally were the settings on location in Hawaii since I watched the film not long after spending nearly three weeks on Oahu, Maui, Hawaii, and Kauai. I recall driving into Princeville (as Matt and family do) on Kauai and being in the exact spot at the airport as they were. And the shot of the ocean with Honolulu in the background that opened the movie brought back memories.The real strength of the movie for me though was in the script and the direction. The clever dovetailing of the plot and subplot (the search for the truth about Matt's marriage; and the disposition of the fabulous estate on Kauai) melded seamlessly together as Matt meets real estate agent (and not a nice guy), Brian Speer. Underlying the story is something deeper though, and that is the growth as human beings that we see the characters go through, especially that of Matt and Alexandra.Excellent in a minor role was Judy Greer as Brian Speer's wife.--Dennis Littrell, author of ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""",5,"Wonderfully redeeming, clever and a bit funny",1362960000,"03 11, 2013",2013,2811,"['fourth', 'Alexander', 'Payne', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'ways', 'best', 'most', 'affecting', 'sure', 'least', 'cried', 'good', 'part', 'What', 'found', 'so', 'touching', 'was', 'way', 'characters', 'came', 'grips', 'reality', 'lives', 'way', 'King', 'family', 'Matt', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Alexandra', 'Shailene', 'Woodley', 'Scottie', 'Amara', 'Miller', 'strengthened', 'family', 'ties', 'tragedy', 'various', 'unpleasant', 'revelations.As', 'Elizabeth', 'King', 'dying', 'deep', 'coma', 'water', 'skiing', 'accident', 'workaholic', 'husband', 'Matt', 'who', 'take', 'care', 'slightly', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'trustee', 'great', 'Hawaiian', 'estate', 'island', 'Kauai', 'now', 'must', 'be', 'sold', 'Getting', 'closer', 'children', 'first', 'younger', 'daughter', 'Scottie', 'behavior', 'lot', 'work', 'Then', 'Big', 'Island', 'where', 'older', 'daughter', 'Alexandra', 'school', 'drunk', 'then', 'Well', 'better', 'see', 'movie', 'see', 'what', 'so', 'almost', 'as', 'funny', 'other', 'Payne', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Election', '1999', 'Schmidt', '2002', 'Sideways', '2004', 'not', 'as', 'satirical', 'Payne', 'hearts', 'one', 'instead', 'whimsy.Clooney', 'excellent', 'part', 'controlled', 'very', 'winning', 'leading', 'man', 'style', 'lot', 'restraint', 'subtle', 'expressiveness', 'Woodley', 'just', '19', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'played', 'wiser-than-her-years', 'teen', 'just', 'enough', 'edginess', 'spitfire', 'be', 'believable', 'so', 'pretty', 'just', 'looking', 'brought', 'tears', 'perhaps', 'most', 'natural', 'performance', 'was', 'Amara', 'Miller', 'foul-mouthed', 'chubby', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'be', 'as', 'grownup', 'big', 'sister.Interesting', 'personally', 'were', 'settings', 'location', 'Hawaii', 'watched', 'film', 'not', 'long', 'spending', 'nearly', 'three', 'weeks', 'Oahu', 'Maui', 'Hawaii', 'Kauai', 'recall', 'driving', 'Princeville', 'Matt', 'family', 'do', 'Kauai', 'being', 'exact', 'spot', 'airport', 'were', 'shot', 'ocean', 'Honolulu', 'background', 'opened', 'movie', 'brought', 'back', 'memories.The', 'real', 'strength', 'movie', 'was', 'script', 'direction', 'clever', 'dovetailing', 'plot', 'subplot', 'search', 'truth', 'Matt', 'marriage', 'disposition', 'fabulous', 'estate', 'Kauai', 'melded', 'seamlessly', 'together', 'Matt', 'meets', 'real', 'estate', 'agent', 'not', 'nice', 'guy', 'Brian', 'Speer', 'Underlying', 'story', 'something', 'deeper', 'growth', 'human', 'beings', 'see', 'characters', 'go', 'especially', 'Matt', 'Alexandra.Excellent', 'minor', 'role', 'was', 'Judy', 'Greer', 'Brian', 'Speer', 'wife.', 'Dennis', 'Littrell', 'author', 'Cut', 'Chaise', 'Lounge', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Believe', 'Swallowed', 'Remote']",The Descendants

I'm not always a big fan of Oscar winning dramas. Not because I don't think they are well written or well acted movies, but sometimes I find them... well... boring.What can I say? I tend to watch movies for enjoyment and entertainment value more than for any other reason.The Descendants was well written and acted by the cast. George Clooney rarely disappoints me as an actor and I believed his character. The crazy gamut of emotions he and his daughters were put through due to his wife's accident were very realistic.  Not everyone grieves in the same way and this was evident in the movie. Kids may act out, family members may point fingers, friends may feel guilty... It tests a person greatly to deal with losing someone.And not just losing anyone - but coming to terms with the fact that a loved one will never wake up from a coma.Amidst the grieving process, Clooney is in charge of helping his family deal with their trust estate. The trust owns many acres of virgin Hawaii land. He and his cousins must sell it before the trust dissolves in 7 years. They are going through bids to find a buyer they are comfortable selling their ancestor's land to for development. While they are descendants of Hawaiian people, there are many native residents that do not want the sale to go through.I thought the entire story was believable and hit close to home - besides the land, the devastation that swept over this family could happen to just about any of us. Any day a loved one could be in an accident that puts them in a vegetative state, leaving the rest to figure out how to live without them. What words were last said... Secrets unveiled... How do you get closure on anger with someone you can never speak with again?The ending reflected real life too by being sort of ""happy enough for now."" it wasn't a sad ending but it was not a definite happy ending.Some takeaway messages I found in this movie:Some things are worth preserving as is even if it means losing out on millions of dollars because doing the right thing is always priceless.Some things are better left unknown.Always be honest with those you love.Verdict: Rent it! While I thought it was a good movie, I did not really enjoy it. It was real and emotion driven, but I don't find much rewatchability in these types of movies. (Save for a few favorites).

Now it caters to the junior ticket buyers and consists mainly of car crashes a la Mel Gibson, kung fu a la Jet Li, and juvenile (or what passes for) humor a la Adam Sandler. Well hold on to your hats ladies and gents for what do we have here? Oh no! A movie that deals with adult themes and manages to do so with intelligence, sensitivity, and wit.Director Alexander Payne (Sideways) really comes through with a winner this time out. His protagonist, confidently played by George Clooney, is a flawed man desperately striving to set his life straight in the face of a dying wife, her infidelity, two neglected daughters, and the self-serving materialism of his family. Clooney is clearly the heart of this film. It is a pleasure to watch as he develops into the finest film actor of his generation. The defining scene of Clooney's performance takes place at the end of The Descendants as he says farewell to his comatose wife. Clooney conveys the emotional depth that we expect from this scene without slobbering or overacting. What he gives us throughout this film is the definition of fine screen acting. The camera finds a diversified reality in the nuances of Clooney's face, often unfairly criticized for being too handsome, as it morphs from near perfection to vulnerability. We believe everything he does and we like him precisely because he is not above making a fool of himself when the script calls for it. Clooney is ably supported by Shailene Woodley as his wayward older daughter, a radiant performance with great variation and insight. Other actors of note are Beau Bridges as a delightfully slimy cousin, Judy Greer as a charming cuckolded wife, and Robert Forster as the grumpy father-in-law.The Descendants deals with some pretty serious themes. How does one cope with the death of a spouse or the incessant demands of young children? Where does money fall in the hierarchy of values? How difficult is it to take an honest look at yourself? Payne tackles each of these issues with tremendous intelligence, allowing for depth of emotion without falling into the trap of becoming corny or trite. He occasionally plays it very close to absurdity but manages to stay on this side of the line. An example is Woodley's idiot boyfriend (Nick Krause in a jolly, nutty performance) who provides much needed comic relief but in the end turns out to be as real as any of the other characters in this excellent screenplay by Payne, Nat Faxon, and Jim Rash. There were many memorable lines of dialogue, e.g., ""Give your kids enough money to do something but not enough to do nothing.""I enjoyed this film immensely and was transported by the emotional thrust of the screenplay.

1429089,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B004UXUX4Q,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 4]","There's a great line in this 2011 dramedy spoken in a voiceover by the protagonist: ""Give your children enough money to do something but not so much that they do nothing."" I'm not sure if that came from author Kaui Hart Hemmings' source novel or from director/co-screenwriter Alexander Payne's pen. Regardless, it's hard to believe Payne hasn't directed a full-length feature since the acclaimedSidewaysin 2004, as this 2011 dramedy most definitely bears his signature approach in focusing on a core set of flawed characters with a deft seriocomic hand. Although the movie is not quite at the level ofSidewaysin shaggily mixing humor with pathos, it does boast a strong performance from George Clooney as Matt King, a wealthy O'ahu-based lawyer with Hawaiian blood, who finds himself in the enviable position of being the sole trustee of 25,000 acres of untouched land on Kaua'i. Dictated by state law, he is just about to get his extended family of cousins to reach consensus on selling the land to a native developer when tragedy strikes.Co-written by Payne, Nat Faxon and Jim Rash, the main narrative revolves around a boating accident that puts Matt's wife Elizabeth into a coma. This tragedy highlights the fact that King, a workaholic by nature, has distanced himself from his two daughters, ten-year-old Scottie and 17-year-old Alex. Suddenly, he discovers he needs to step forward and confront Scottie's bullying at school and Alex's rebellious hostility. When it becomes clear to him that Elizabeth will never recover, he tells Alex they need to visit family members to give them an opportunity to say goodbye. The strenuously resistant Alex surprises him by sharing that she caught her mother having an affair before the accident. This starts a family journey that gives way to revelations and confrontations which allow him to acknowledge his own failures and make peace with what the future will bring. On the surface, the story sounds like it will turn into a straight-ahead tearjerker, but thanks to Payne's discretion, the emotions the characters express and the situations they face are far more disheveled than that and consequently more compelling.It's not that Clooney does anything that takes him that far away from his usual screen persona here. Rather, he backseats his trademark coolness to convey a deeper level of vulnerability and confusion as a man unprepared for single parenthood. As Alex, Shailene Woodley gives a terrifically nuanced performance traversing easily between unbridled insolence and supportive nurturing. Amara Miller provides the right level of precocious honesty in her moments as Scottie. The rest of the cast makes less of an impression, for instance, Robert Forster as Matt's highly coiled father-in-law and Judy Greer as the unsuspecting wife of the realtor who had the affair with Elizabeth. The one fly in the ointment is Nick Krause, who appears to serve purely as a comic plot device as Alex's stoner-dude pal Sid. This character is the one major misstep in Payne's treatment. On the upside, cinematographer Phedon Papamichael captures the Hawaiian locations with greater variety than you would expect, and the soundtrack uses purely Hawaiian music to great effect.

1429090,A2PLMMVM7J0128,B004UXUX4Q,Ehkzu,"[3, 7]","This is a great family film that's R-rated. In it, even little kids say words that would have had my grandmother beating them with a stick for uttering. And yet, honest to Pete, in every other respect it's a wonderful PG-13 family film that endorses family, integrity, good parenting.And it's a really good movie by cinematic standards, wholly apart from the values it promotes. I once heard that casting was 80% of a movie. If so, ""The Descendants"" wins big time because the casting is flawless. George Clooney sinks into his character--which is tough to do when you're such a big star (and you look like Jay Leno's handsome first cousin). You really see him as his character, and his voiceover narration actually works, unlike many voiceovers.But the first class casting extends down to the smallest parts--the sign of a fine movie. And the second role, the hero's rebellious daughter, is played with real distinction by Shailene Woodley, previously only known as the lead in the CW network's teen soaper/weekly abstinence infomercial ""Secret Life of the American Teenager.""The film is set entirely in Hawaii--mostly in the Oahu of those who live there and have lived there for generations, in a suburban lifestyle that looks very much like mainland suburbia except that even the wealthiest families in the fanciest get-togethers are all barefoot. It's pretty cool, really.Hawaii is one of the best pieces of casting--casting because it comes one of the main characters, providing a backdrop for the human players who are all--hence the title--the descendants of haoles from the mainland and local Hawaiians who intermarried.One character who has precious screen time is Matthew Lillard, who I only knew of from his role in the Scooby Doo movies--that is, as a rubber-faced buffoon. But here in a small role he does a great job portraying a quasi-slimeball who isn't quite as bad as we're led to think. And Judy Greer, playing the character's wife, does an equally great job with a small role.The cinematography is competent if not cutting edge. It's aided by being set in Hawaii. Hard to lose with that one. I've been there several times, and the film really took me back. I could smell the warm, humid air and how it makes the main character (Clooney's) sweat when he runs for a while.This film has gotten rave reviews from the critcs and from audiences. You will do yourself a favor if you see it based on those and this, without trying to find out all the details of the movie. You can get the whole plot easily enough, since most reviews tell the whole story most of the time. I'm trying to help preserve some element of surprise for you here, while still telling you whether you should see it, and whether in a theater or not.As for that, my rule of thumb is to only see 3D films in theaters rather than on my 46"" flat screen home theater. This film isn't 3D, but I happened to see it in a theater. Some people I saw it with thought the Hawaiian setting was enough to justify seeing it in a theater. I dunno, but that is an argument for it. But I don't think you'll feel bereft if you wait for the DVD.The same evening we saw ""How to tame your dragon"" on a home theatre, and it made us greatly miss how great it had looked in a theater in 3D, BTW.The measure of a film, for me, is whether it sticks with me. This has. The characters are so richly drawn, and the actors convey their characters with so much good acting and not all the talkiness that screenwriters like to put in everyone's mouths. I'm talkative myself, but most people really aren't, and I felt the screenwriting here was true to the characters' characters.Need anything more to decide whether to see it? Well I should add that it's a dramady that moves deftly between comic and very serous moments. At the end, you won't feel devastated. Actually, you'll have trouble not smiling--the kind of warm smile I often give my wife of 30 years after a moment of shared understanding. The film is sophisticated in its characterizations without being at all arch or pretentious. It's an honest movie with a lot of heart, yet without hiding any of the characters' flaws--or, in the case of the more or less bad guys--strengths. Ultimately it has no saints or devils. Just a bunch of people, connected in various way, doing the best they can...in Paradise.EDIT: I realize I failed here to steer people away from ""The Descendants"" who wouldn't enjoy it. Like the viewer just above this review who gave it two stars for not being the laugh riot he'd expected--and which, frankly, the studio's marketing led some to expect. I added a long comment to his review, addressing his concerns--and full of spoilers, so be warned before you read it!What I can say here without spoilers is that it's a dramedy. Don't go expecting a light hearted comedic romp! It's got plenty of funny moments, but it's really a pretty serious film. I mean, ""Hamlet"" has a funny Gravedigger Scene, you know?You also won't like it if you need everything spelled out for you clearly, as TV mostly does, and Hollywood mostly does. This film is subtle, which to the unsubtle looks like bo-ring.Lastly, you won't like it if you're looking for action. This has no explosions, almost no violence, no car chases, no sex, no horror, no gore, no talky revelations. So you have to pay attention. It's not going to beat you over the head with The Meaning. Life doesn't come with subtitles, and neither does this. It's about family life and a middle aged guy trying to restart his life without making a complete fool of himself (and almost succeeding), set in suburban Hawaii.Hope that helps.",5,No spoilers review

He's in the midst of a real estate deal that the entire island is watching; his wife (Patricia Hastie) is on life support following a boating accident; and his two daughters (Shailene Woodley and Amara Miller) are acting out.  He's never been the family disciplinarian, and their lack of respect perpetually baffles him.  Further complicating things, King realizes that his wife has been unfaithful with someone (Matthew Lillard) who he's never met but has direct ties to the land deal.This may sound like grim subject matter, but it's handled deftly and with more than a touch of black humor.

The high points include the beautiful scenery of Hawaii and George Clooney's characterization of Matt King, a father who has lost touch with his family.  It is a bit slow at times, but this is a movie about coming to terms not just with grief and losing a family member, but with realizing that some things are worth far more than money.Matt King is a lawyer who is the trustee of a huge parcel of untouched land on one of the islands that has come down in his family since they married into Hawaiian royalty, land that they are being forced to finally sell.  At the same time, his wife is in a coma in the hospital due to a boating accident and he has to deal with his two daughters, Scottie and Alexandra, something he clearly has not much practice in.  Not only that, Alexandra is clearly angry with her mother over some secret that he knows nothing about.As the secret unfolds, Matt must deal with what his marriage had turned into along with his grief over his dying wife and the difficulties with having to tell their friends and family they all need to say good bye to her.  He also begins to struggle with the idea of giving up the family inheritance over to development that will ruin the pristine beauty of the place he is entrusted to protect.  He realizes that he had lost track of what was really important and strives to regain it.A good movie to watch the one time, but I doubt I will keep it.

1429105,A328S9RN3U5M68,B004UXUX4Q,Grady Harp,"[1, 3]","Yes, the story is worth telling (from a book by Kaui Hart Hemmings) and the study of contemporary family life with all its flaws is commendable, and yes, George Clooney submerges himself in a role that is anything but his usual romance hero roles, but it seems that the ideas presented could have been condensed into an hour long movie for television instead of spread over 2 hours of interminable Hawaiian music backed vistas of the islands. The film appeals to a lot of people and that is satisfying to note that movie goers care enough about end of life issues and flawed parenting skills to support the ideas buried in this extravaganza.Matt King (George Clooney though looking unkempt and sloppy is solid in a an introspective and subdued performance) is a real estate attorney who happens to be the controlling descendant in a family whose ancestors date back to the days of Hawaiian kings: the family owns a large parcel of land they plan to sell to become instantly wealthy, a move the Hawaiians find disturbing as the influx of commercialism would destroy the native beauty of their island. Matt's wife Elizabeth is critically injured in a boating accident and is in a coma, not only affecting Matt emotionally but also pointing up the fact that he must assume full parental duties in coping with his two rather outrageous daughters - Alexandra (Shailene Woodley in a career making brilliant role) and chubby troublesome Scottie (Amara Miller). He brings Alex home from the boarding school she has been attending in an attempt to make her less sociopathic (she has fought seriously with her mother, drinks to excess and behaves badly) but she come with her loopy friend Sid (Nick Krause, another fine performance) who ends up being not unlike Matt.  Alex tells Matt the Elizabeth was having an affair, a note that shocks Matt and sets him on a quest to discover who gained his wife's attention. When he discovers the boyfriend was a married real estate broker Brian Speer (Matthew Lillard) whose wife Julie (Judy Greer) Matt meets on the beach the attempt to bring closure to this portion of Matt's life, as Elizabeth is taken off life support machines, opens windows of communication between Matt and his daughters, with Sid who isn't as loopy as Matt perceived, with Elizabeth's parents (Robert Forster and Barbara L. Southern who embodies Alzheimer's Disease well), and most of all with himself. He gains courage to respect his heritage of Hawaiian land, dismisses his family's greed (from which Brian Speer would have benefited), and becomes an enlightened and emotionally more mature man.THE DESCENDANTS is a worthy film with a few good performances and a star turn for Clooney and Woodley, but oh, turn off that interminable Hawaiian music that drowns the story like a tsunami!

1429107,A13TO5TU4A68LD,B004UXUX4Q,Gryphonisle,"[1, 5]","The Descendants.  What does that say to you?  Somehow I missed everything about this movie, trailers and reviews, except for the part of it being shot in Hawaii.  I had no idea what to expect, although someone wrote it was like ""every other George Clooney movie"".  I can't say either way, even after seeing it.  To me, the title could be for a Sci-Fi Horror flick, where the Descendants are those of Martians who impregnated women five generations ago, and now, after passing from womb to female child from generation to generation, they're ready to pop out, after devouring the living woman in the most gory fashion, of course, and terrorize the audience for the next ninety minutes, and four sequels.  Or something.This movie is not that movie.  It could probably use a better title.  It opens with a panoramic shot of Diamond Head and Waikiki environs, shot from a tower or hillside house near Punchbowl, or thereabouts.  Then there's a shot of a nice blonde woman in a speeding boat.  One gets the impression this boat ride went bad, but one never sees it.  Instead, George Clooney's voice, sounding bitter, is talking about living in paradise and how everyone seems to think that makes life better.  Instead, he asks (and I paraphrase) ""does that make our diseases less fatal?  Our families less screwed up?"".  Yep, the whole film set up right there.  It turns out that the pretty lady in the boat is Clooney's wife, and she fell out of boat and is in a coma.  She's going to die, that's not the focus of the movie, as she left a living will, so we'll move along.  I can't tell you what happens, but I can say the marriage was not going well, George spent too much time in the office;  there are two daughters, one of which looks more Hawaiian than anybody else in the film, which begs the question, who was HER father?  The older daughter has a cave man for a boyfriend, or at least that's what you think until Grandpa, father of the dying woman, punches him.  Yep, you can't tell the kids from the adults these days.  So there are family issues.But, the Family, is also a trust, holding 25000 acres of pristine Kauai ocean front property, and the trust will expire in seven years.  Fear Not.  The movie does not cover even one year.  So, they're meeting to talk about selling the land.  The sale will make them all filthy rich, and some of them need the money.  At this point it's worth pointing out that the trust dates back over 100 years, to A Real Hawaiian Princess (we thought Hollywood was over this enchantment with native princesses, but apparently not).  She was a direct descendant of King Kamehameha, but she married a haole (a white dude, although the word, like Gringo, originally meant stranger, and was first used on the Chinese) and that's how we can have a movie set in Hawaii with almost no Hawaiians in it.  Or Filipinos, Chinese, etc etc.  (For those of you who are pineapple starved:  King Kam unified the islands under his rule in the 18th century.  The caboose end of that dynasty was King Kalakaua, who blew the wad on two world tours and a grand marriage based on that of Emperor Napoleon III and Empress Eugenie, who at least had an empire to pay for it).So, once we establish that A) Mom Is Going To DIe.  and that B) We Must Sell The Land (we think).  The only thing left to do is to find out what they do with the land, and how George will react to the news that his nest has been invaded by a real estate geek---I'm sure the actor is a real nice guy, but if you already have George Clooney, would you really be going after a geek?  I suppose so, but I don't like it.The older daughter and her boyfriend are developed nicely.  The little girl remains something of a pet human.  The cousins, aunts and uncles, are nothing but talking background, and Dad In Law is the Character.  George Clooney plays the sort of fatherly role once played by Fred MacMurray and Robert Young (if you don't know who they are, you ARE young, and aren't missing much, but you should ask around from time to time, in case you miss the start of the war) and while he's quite sympathetic and likeable, we never really get to know him.  No one ever seems to realize that it is HIS wife who is comatose, despite their failings.  I think the movie would have been better with a bit more of a focus on him, along with the daughters.In the end, given that the impetus of the film is set by the dying woman, once she's gone and all the questions are answered, about her and the land (it's on his side, not hers) you've pretty much had the experience.  Watch it again?  Maybe.  I'm not so sure.  I give stars as much for watchability in reruns, and three stars is a movie I'd buy, or already own.  I give this a two.  It's a run of the mill dying person story, sharing the plot with a family business drama, and minus the Love quotient that would have made the dying part sufficient to carry the film.  So, while it's worth a first try, I'd put it half way down your list with a view towards a hurricane evacuation;  a very rainy day, or when you're snowed in, next winter.  Set in a nice Sonoma red and some cheese and do it in style.",2,"A Run Of The Mill Story Of Loss, Enhanced By Its Setting, And Good Character Development.",1337817600,"05 24,

1429112,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B004UXUX4Q,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[4, 8]","George Clooney's character, Matt King, is quick to point out that even living on an island paradise doesn't exempt one from exposure to the kinds of messed-up crap that inflict everyone else. Life in its essence is the same for the inhabitants of Hawaii. You just live it wearing colorful shirts, shorts, and sandals. THE DESCENDANTS certainly has its laugh-out-loud bits, but mostly it's a drama about loss and grief and acceptance and all that superfun stuff. And if I were to gauge this film's quality by how often I heard guffaws and sniffles in the theater I went to, then THE DESCENDANTS has earned some big bragging rights. And maybe an Oscar nod for Clooney, and maybe another one for a superb young actress, Shailene Woodley. Both of them anchor the film.Clooney inhabits his role with a thoughtfulness and an intelligence that not too many of his contemporaries could've matched, and every so often he's not afraid to play the fool (did you check out his goofy jogging?). Mostly, attorney Matt King is just trying to keep his head above water, as he juggles several pressing issues. As the sole trustee of the family's highly coveted ancestral land, there's pressure from his sprawling cast of greedy cousins to sell. Matt is also trying to keep his two troubled young daughters in check, never mind that he views himself as the back-up parent. Most painfully, his comatose wife, Elizabeth, had suffered a grave boating accident, and it's only a matter of time before the plug is pulled, in accordance to her living will. And if you've seen the trailer then you know that his foul-mouthed oldest daughter, Alexandra (Woodley), springs a huge shock on him. In one of her frequent raging tantrums, she informs him that his wife had been cheating on him. Because even paradise sees its share of rocky marriages.Clooney's restrained performance is compelling and I love his acting choices, the things that he does and how he expresses his dialogue (and there's plenty of dialogue). But I knew Clooney could act. Shailene Woodley is the revelation. Even more than Clooney, Woodley, angry and conflicted and forceful, provides the story's emotional impact. It's a splendid cast across the board, really, from Amara Miller (who plays Matt's ten-year-old daughter Scotty) to a surprisingly grown-up Matthew Lillard to Judy Greer who is absolutely fantastic as the wife of the man cheating with Elizabeth. Nick Krause steals several scenes as Alexandra's st0ner surfer boyfriend Sid. Sid accompanies the Kings as Matt, Alex, and Scotty go island-hopping in search of the elusive other man in Elizabeth's life. I guess it's one way to cope with the impending loss of a loved one. Sid starts out as this oblivious tool but later demonstrates unexpected levels of insight and loyalty. One of Matt King's voice-over observations is that in Hawaii ""the most powerful men look like bums and stunt men."" In a tiny but pivotal part, Beau Bridges plays one of Matt's laid back cousins, and it's worth it to see Bridges not missing a beat as he goes from affable to affably menacing.Hawaii provides a picturesque backdrop, and it's maybe jarring that we're watching this sad family affair unfolding on an idyllic island paradise. Or maybe that's the conflicting emotion director Alexander Payne was going for. A certain askewed perception. Grief looks a bit odd when the mourners are always dressed for a barbecue. Ultimately THE DESCENDANTS is frank and honest, and sometimes brutally honest. I like that it doesn't pander or try to be cute. The story runs the gamut of laughter and tears, and there's something rewarding in watching Matt and his kids pull together. Elizabeth, the dying wife and mother, is portrayed as a complicated real person, and not put on a pedestal, or not much, anyway. We become privy to her virtues but also to her faults, and the film suggests that Matt, too, is not without blame. And Payne doesn't shy away from exhibiting the degenerative physical toll exacted on a failing coma patient. Each of Matt's visits to the hospital documents Elizabeth's further wasting away. Which sort of wends back to Matt King's point early on. There's no escaping life; it comes with heavy baggages; and death even in paradise is the great leveler. But it's hard to console yourself with that. Me, I'd probably act out, like Matt's kids.",4,marital heartbreak and raising unruly kids and antics with real estate and  Clooney's funny jogging,1322956800,"12 4, 2011",2011,4343,"['George', 'Clooney', 'character', 'Matt', 'King', 'quick', 'point', 'out', 'even', 'living', 'island', 'paradise', ""n't"", 'exempt', 'one', 'exposure', 'kinds', 'messed-up', 'crap', 'inflict', 'everyone', 'else', 'Life', 'essence', 'same', 'inhabitants', 'Hawaii', 'just', 'live', 'wearing', 'colorful', 'shirts', 'shorts', 'sandals', 'DESCENDANTS', 'certainly', 'laugh-out-loud', 'bits', 'mostly', 'drama', 'loss', 'grief', 'acceptance', 'superfun', 'stuff', 'were', 'gauge', 'film', 'quality', 'how', 'often', 'heard', 'guffaws', 'sniffles', 'theater', 'went', 'then', 'THE', 'DESCENDANTS', 'earned', 'big', 'bragging', 'rights', 'maybe', 'Oscar', 'nod', 'Clooney', 'maybe', 'one', 'superb', 'young', 'actress', 'Shailene', 'Woodley', 'anchor', 'film.Clooney', 'role', 'thoughtfulness', 'intelligence', 'not', 'too', 'many', 'contemporaries', 'could', ""'ve"", 'matched', 'so', 'often', 'not', 'afraid', 'play', 'fool', 'did', 'check', 'out', 'goofy', 'jogging', 'Mostly', 'attorney', 'Matt', 'King', 'just', 'trying', 'keep', 'head', 'water', 'several', 'pressing', 'issues', 'sole', 'trustee', 'family', 'highly', 'coveted', 'ancestral', 'land', 'pressure', 'sprawling', 'cast', 'greedy', 'cousins', 'sell', 'Matt', 'also', 'trying', 'keep', 'two', 'troubled', 'young', 'daughters', 'check', 'never', 'mind', 'back-up', 'parent', 'Most', 'painfully', 'comatose', 'wife', 'Elizabeth', 'had', 'suffered', 'grave', 'boating', 'accident', 'only', 'matter', 'time', 'plug', 'pulled', 'accordance', 'living', 'will', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'trailer', 'then', 'know', 'foul-mouthed', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'Alexandra', 'Woodley', 'huge', 'shock', 'one', 'frequent', 'raging', 'tantrums', 'wife', 'had', 'been', 'cheating', 'even', 'paradise', 'share', 'rocky', 'marriages.Clooney', 'restrained', 'performance', 'compelling', 'love', 'acting', 'choices', 'things', 'how', 'dialogue', 'plenty', 'dialogue', 'knew', 'Clooney', 'could', 'act', 'Shailene', 'Woodley', 'revelation', 'Even', 'more', 'Clooney', 'Woodley', 'angry', 'conflicted', 'forceful', 'story', 'emotional', 'impact', 'splendid', 'cast', 'board', 'really', 'Amara', 'Miller', 'who', 'Matt', 'ten-year-old', 'daughter', 'Scotty', 'surprisingly', 'grown-up', 'Matthew', 'Lillard', 'Judy', 'Greer', 'who', 'absolutely', 'fantastic', 'wife', 'man', 'cheating', 'Elizabeth', 'Nick', 'Krause', 'several', 'scenes', 'Alexandra', 'st0ner', 'surfer', 'boyfriend', 'Sid', 'Sid', 'Kings', 'Matt', 'Alex', 'Scotty', 'go', 'island-hopping', 'search', 'elusive', 'other', 'man', 'Elizabeth', 'life', 'guess', 'one', 'way', 'cope', 'impending', 'loss', 'loved', 'one', 'Sid', 'out', 'oblivious', 'tool', 'later', 'unexpected', 'levels', 'insight', 'loyalty', 'One', 'Matt', 'King', 'voice-over', 'observations', 'Hawaii', 'most', 'powerful', 'men', 'look', 'bums', 'stunt', 'men', 'tiny', 'pivotal', 'part', 'Beau', 'Bridges', 'one', 'Matt', 'laid', 'back', 'cousins', 'worth', 'see', 'Bridges', 'not', 'missing', 'beat', 'affable', 'affably', 'menacing.Hawaii', 'picturesque', 'backdrop', 'maybe', 'jarring', ""'re"", 'watching', 'sad', 'family', 'affair', 'unfolding', 'idyllic', 'island', 'paradise', 'maybe', 'conflicting', 'emotion', 'director', 'Alexander', 'Payne', 'was', 'going', 'certain', 'askewed', 'perception', 'Grief', 'bit', 'odd', 'when', 'mourners', 'are', 'always', 'dressed', 'barbecue', 'Ultimately', 'THE', 'DESCENDANTS', 'frank', 'honest', 'sometimes', 'brutally', 'honest', ""n't"", 'pander', 'try', 'be', 'cute', 'story', 'gamut', 'laughter', 'tears', 'something', 'rewarding', 'watching', 'Matt', 'kids', 'pull', 'together', 'Elizabeth', 'dying', 'wife', 'mother', 'portrayed', 'complicated', 'real', 'person', 'not', 'put', 'pedestal', 'not', 'much', 'anyway', 'become', 'privy', 'virtues', 'also', 'faults', 'film', 'Matt', 'too', 'not', 'blame', 'Payne', ""n't"", 'shy', 'away', 'exhibiting', 'degenerative', 'physical', 'toll', 'exacted', 'failing', 'coma', 'patient', 'Matt', 'visits', 'hospital', 'documents', 'Elizabeth', 'further', 'wasting', 'away', 'Which', 'sort', 'wends', 'back', 'Matt', 'King', 'point', 'early', 'escaping', 'life', 'heavy', 'baggages', 'death', 'even', 'paradise', 'great', 'leveler', 'hard', 'console', 'Me', ""'d"", 'probably', 'act', 'out', 'Matt', 'kids']",The Descendants

Has the West in its vast financial, debt and economic crisis become absolutely morbid when having to face the loss of its hegemony in the world? I believe so and there are two attitudes possible.Either you refuse it and you get angry and you start accusing everyone and the whole world of some kind of plot against you, like in Greece and you burn the central public library. That's the choice of the wife of the lover of the dying wife-mother-daughter-cousin-relative of the main male character marvellously rendered by Clooney.Or you start taming your anger and looking beyond this narrow-minded reaction and you try to come to terms with the situation, with death, with an affair, with so many things that should not prevent life from going on. Because life has to go on, even in Spain, Italy, Ireland, France and elsewhere in this Western world.And the choice is personal and has to be negotiated in the film by a middle-aged widowed husband and father; by a teenage daughter that had difficult relations with the mother; by a young daughter who is still a child and does not even know what death is; by the lover who loved or did not love but used the wife before her death and implanted in her some mirage; by the wife of that occasional and indelicate lover; by the members of the fund that is supposed to take care of a big chunk of one of the Hawaiian islands, a territory that is still virginal and is greedily desired by some real estate developer whose brother in law is the indelicate lover; by so many other people around that comatose woman who signed her will to be unplugged if she was to get into such a situation.Parting from the dying, nearly dead person is always difficult and Clooney and his fellow actors or family members play that drama, that painful trauma with the dignity and the restraint necessary to make it poignant without making it melodramatic. Just for that reason you should see that film and enjoy it. Take it as a good preparation for the traumas, personal, national or universal, that may happen tomorrow at sunrise, if not before.It is not the Tree of Life, but the Tree of Death that goes on growing beyond death because Death is Life and Life never stopped in front of Death.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,Death makes life fatal and the show that goes on morbid,1335830400,"05 1, 2012",2012,2288,"['strange', 'film', 'indeed', 'echoing', 'Tree', 'Life', 'West', 'vast', 'financial', 'debt', 'economic', 'crisis', 'become', 'absolutely', 'morbid', 'when', 'having', 'face', 'loss', 'hegemony', 'world', 'believe', 'so', 'are', 'two', 'attitudes', 'refuse', 'get', 'angry', 'start', 'accusing', 'everyone', 'whole', 'world', 'kind', 'plot', 'Greece', 'burn', 'central', 'public', 'library', 'choice', 'wife', 'lover', 'dying', 'wife-mother-daughter-cousin-relative', 'main', 'male', 'character', 'marvellously', 'rendered', 'Clooney.Or', 'start', 'taming', 'anger', 'looking', 'narrow-minded', 'reaction', 'try', 'come', 'terms', 'situation', 'death', 'affair', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'should', 'not', 'prevent', 'life', 'going', 'life', 'go', 'even', 'Spain', 'Italy', 'Ireland', 'France', 'elsewhere', 'Western', 'choice', 'personal', 'be', 'negotiated', 'film', 'middle-aged', 'widowed', 'husband', 'father', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'had', 'difficult', 'relations', 'mother', 'young', 'daughter', 'who', 'still', 'child', 'not', 'even', 'know', 'what', 'death', 'lover', 'who', 'loved', 'did', 'not', 'love', 'used', 'wife', 'death', 'implanted', 'mirage', 'wife', 'occasional', 'indelicate', 'lover', 'members', 'fund', 'supposed', 'take', 'care', 'big', 'chunk', 'one', 'Hawaiian', 'islands', 'territory', 'still', 'virginal', 'greedily', 'desired', 'real', 'estate', 'developer', 'brother', 'law', 'indelicate', 'lover', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'people', 'comatose', 'woman', 'who', 'signed', 'will', 'be', 'unplugged', 'was', 'get', 'such', 'situation.Parting', 'dying', 'nearly', 'dead', 'person', 'always', 'difficult', 'Clooney', 'fellow', 'actors', 'family', 'members', 'play', 'drama', 'trauma', 'dignity', 'restraint', 'necessary', 'make', 'poignant', 'making', 'melodramatic', 'Just', 'reason', 'should', 'see', 'film', 'enjoy', 'Take', 'good', 'preparation', 'traumas', 'personal', 'national', 'universal', 'may', 'happen', 'tomorrow', 'sunrise', 'not', 'before.It', 'not', 'Tree', 'Life', 'Tree', 'Death', 'growing', 'death', 'Death', 'Life', 'Life', 'never', 'stopped', 'front', 'Death.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",The Descendants

THE DESCENDANTS feels more like Payne's ABOUT SCHMIDT, which gave Jack Nicholson a good late-career role but was still just another road movie. The film feels underwritten and too often predictable. There is little doubt where we are going, but Payne's journey to get us there is too often uncertain in tone. Scenes and incidents, some funny, others sad, are set up, and then don't pay off. Clooney gives a good, understated performance, but his character's changes, from selfish, stingy, uncaring father and husband, to loving, concerned dad and human being, are never dramatized; we're just supposed to accept it. The whole cast is good, even Nick Krause in the Keanu Reeves role from ""Parenthood"" (the scene where the dopey teen gives advice to Clooney about his daughter is the same as Reeves giving advice to Dianne Wiest in the earlier film). Some times it feels as though the film were too heavily edited, and the missing scenes would have answered all our questions and satisfied our emotional needs.

He sits in a hospital room where his wife lies in a coma after a horrific boating accident that occurred off of Waikiki Beach. He goes home to care for his 10 year old daughter that he rarely has been with because of his travels and work load. His daughter is an out of control foul mouthed brat who has no respect for anyone. His older 17 year old daughter is in a private boarding school and she is even more ill-tempered and disrespectful.Matt was so involved in his life as a lawyer and the fact that he was the caretaker of the family's trust fund of billions of dollars of pristine land in Hawaii that he rarely had time for his family. Now he is seeing the results of his self-centered life and he is facing the consequences.When he tries to tell his older daughter that her mom is severely injured she tells him that she doesn't care. She has hated her mom since their big fight at Christmas. She tells her dad that she caught her mom cheating on him with another man and that he had no clue what was going on.....This is a tragic story of a dysfunctional family faced with the potential loss of their wife and mother and having no relationship with each other. Matt who wants to blame his wife for having an affair, realizes that if she had been happy then she would not have cheated. If he had been a better father then his daughters would be more respectful and loving.How they cope with the pending loss and with each other is an endearing story of human relationships and failures. The saga is a sad story of lost loves and lost family members and of trying to rebuild a normal life. In the end Matt realizes that no matter what has happened, he loves his wife and his daughters more than ever. Perhaps there is a chance for some happiness after all!We enjoyed this movie and felt that it was very good.

And because of its locale (Hawaii), visually interesting, too.  The acting is brilliant, as well.  Especially George Clooney in what had to be a challenging role.  I mean, he plays completely against the grain of what he really is: a handsome, confident movie actor.  And pulls it off magnificently.The reason I so disliked this film, I think, is because I've seen one too many movies about angst.  Or, I should say more specifically, angst in characters I don't give a rat's patootie about.Clooney plays an oblivious real estate attorney -- really more dork-like, I think, than oblivious -- whose family life disintegrated because of his habitual inability to see what really has been going on.  We're given to believe that he's been utterly clueless as to what his wife and kids have thought, needed and felt.  All because he was too absorbed in his ""fascinating"" law practice.  Or something.Woven into that ""melodrama"" then, is also his status as the administrator of his huge family's (seemingly a hundred cousins) extensive island land holdings.  All of which seems comprised of the last of Hawaii's prime undeveloped real estate (and worth approaching a billion).  Which, naturally, his countless cousins start squabbling over when legal technicalities are about to force a liquidation.Anyway, I just couldn't begin to care what happened to any character in ""The Descendants.""  At its ending, had Clooney been washed out to sea by a tsunami, my reaction would likely have been, ""Oh... that's one way to end it, I guess.""In all fairness, this film deserves more than a single star (just on the acting alone).

1429133,A356HRZZFCEGL1,B004UXUX4Q,"John Panagopoulos ""John Andrew Panagopoulos""","[5, 10]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Nothing new appears in the plot department in ""The Descendants"". For the umpteenth time, we have a successful, workaholic father (George Clooney as Matt King) juggling three problems: 1) attempting to be more ""parental"" with older, estranged, profane daughter Alex (Shailene Woodley) and uninhibited younger daughter Scottie (Amara Miller), 2)monitoring the comatose, near-death state of his adventurous wife Elizabeth (Patricia Hastie), and 3) as trustee pondering how to dispose of prime Hawaii seafront real estate: sell it and make many family beneficiaries obscenely rich or preserve its pristine beauty. As you can see, Matt's plate is overflowing.The movie is about how Matt methodically and gradually addresses his three problems. To some degree, ""The Descendants"" is ultimately predictable. However, what is novel is the theme that we almost never act from purely noble, altruistic motives. In the decisions Matt makes, he simultaneously shows patience and exasperation, -self-control and vengeance, reconciliation and resentment.For example, as he tries to reestablish a connection with Alex, Matt is fumblingly, hilariously, and sadly ineffective. That is, until he learns that his wife was having a clandestine affair. Matt, of course, is fiercely determined to ferret out the slime who cuckolded him, though this ""righteous crusade"" is somewhat tempered by the fact that Elizabeth may have cheated on him because Matt neglected her in favor of work. Perked up by the prospect of this juicy, scandalous mystery, Alex slowly drops her ""sullen teen"" facade and eagerly helps her dad discover that a Brian Speer (Matthew Lillard), a real-estate broker, is responsible. Therefore, at least and partially for underhanded reasons, they grudgingly get closer, though as the movie progresses, their relationship improves for more honorable ones.As another example, Matt finally confronts Brian at his rented seaside cottage about the affair. But instead of getting into a spirited fistfight that would shatter the lawyer's reputation, Matt quietly but determinedly interrogates Brian about his tryst with Elizabeth and informs him about Elizabeth's tragic state. Again, Matt's logical way of handling this seems more humane, but it is also more searingly effective in wounding and humbling Brian, and eventually Brian's wife Julie (Judy Greer), to whom he confesses. It also exposes Brian for the cowardly louse he is, since he refuses to visit Elizabeth on her sick/death bed and sends his wife instead.Matt displays his ulterior motives regarding the land sale. With his family members, he views the breathtaking property and realizes it would be commercially vile to condemn it to condo development. Therefore, he gathers the cousin beneficiaries together to tell them that he will not sign the land over to developers. But his new-found environmentalism is not the only reason for Matt's decision. He also doesn't want the idle cousins, who never cared for the land in any way and only acquired it through descent, to profit. But Brian, coincidentally, was orchestrating the deal, and Matt REALLY doesn't want HIM to profit.As the final example, Matt discontinues life support for his wife when the doctors tell him that her head trauma from a boating accident will eventually doom her. Of course, this is an obvious act of charity and a concession to her ""Do Not Resuscitate"" wishes. However, it also gives the all-too-human Matt, his daughters, and his in-laws the chance to vent about her flaws and failures and infidelities without her actually hearing it. Hypocritically, Matt even tries to restrain the others' ventings, especially from Brian's wife, as if only he has the right to complain unreservedly against his wife.

1429134,A3GRN6J64F2C3X,B004UXUX4Q,"Joseph P. Menta, Jr.","[4, 9]","The enjoyable, moving ""The Descendents"" (written and directed by Alexander Payne, based on the novel by Kaui Hart Hemmings) smartly depicts how a major development in a family- in this case, a tragedy- immediately steamrolls and negates all petty drama and grievances, and quite efficiently illuminates everyone's true colors and true feelings.George Clooney is terrific as Matt King, a marginal parent who all of a sudden is thrust into the role of central parent and responsibility bearer when a boating accident puts his wife Elizabeth into a coma.  Things become more complicated when it becomes clear that Elizabeth isn't going to wake up, and that her legal wishes indicate that she doesn't want to be kept alive via artificial means if a situation like her current one ever arose.Despite the subject matter, the film isn't relentlessly sad.  It's nice to see the strong bond that immediately develops between Matt and his oldest daughter Alexandra (beautifully played by Shailene Woodley), who tosses aside the usual teen issues that drove a wedge between her and her parents in recent years, and starts helping her dad put her mother's affairs in order and prepare for her funeral.And when I use the word ""affairs"" above, I don't just mean finances and legal stuff.  Matt soon learns from his daughter that he wasn't the only imperfect spouse in their family, though he is shocked to learn exactly what his wife was up to during her last months.With the help of his family, and one or two hangers-on, Matt puts things to rest during the course of the movie, resulting in situations that are funny, sad, moving, sometimes ridiculous, but always very human.  It's interesting that Matt's forgiveness of his wife's infidelity comes fairly early on (though residual anger surfaces here and there), because there's work to be done. Despite what he's learned, he's determined to put his wife to rest with dignity and love, and to honor her memory properly with friends and family.Filling out the movie are some beautiful locations in Hawaii, a quirky subplot involving Matt and Alexandra trying to locate Elizabeth's secret lover (despite their negative feelings about that part of her life, they want to give the guy the opportunity to properly say goodbye to her), and another subplot involving a major land deal being overseen my Matt, which ultimately ties into the movie's theme of identifying what's really important in life.In the end, ""The Descendents"" is an involving family drama that honestly earns the emotions it brings forth. And, really, don't let the premise scare you off.  You'll likely leave the film feeling upbeat and chatty, ready to discuss the film's humor and humanity.",5,"Love conquers all, even messy family situations",1322611200,"11 30, 2011",2011,2696,"['enjoyable', 'moving', 'Descendents', 'written', 'directed', 'Alexander', 'Payne', 'based', 'novel', 'Kaui', 'Hart', 'Hemmings', 'smartly', 'how', 'major', 'development', 'family-', 'case', 'tragedy-', 'immediately', 'steamrolls', 'petty', 'drama', 'grievances', 'quite', 'efficiently', 'everyone', 'true', 'colors', 'true', 'feelings.George', 'Clooney', 'terrific', 'Matt', 'King', 'marginal', 'parent', 'who', 'sudden', 'thrust', 'role', 'central', 'parent', 'responsibility', 'bearer', 'when', 'boating', 'accident', 'wife', 'Elizabeth', 'coma', 'become', 'more', 'complicated', 'when', 'clear', 'Elizabeth', ""n't"", 'going', 'wake', 'up', 'legal', 'wishes', 'indicate', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'kept', 'alive', 'artificial', 'means', 'situation', 'current', 'one', 'ever', 'subject', 'matter', 'film', ""n't"", 'relentlessly', 'sad', 'nice', 'see', 'strong', 'bond', 'immediately', 'Matt', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'Alexandra', 'beautifully', 'played', 'Shailene', 'Woodley', 'who', 'aside', 'usual', 'teen', 'issues', 'drove', 'wedge', 'parents', 'recent', 'years', 'helping', 'dad', 'put', 'mother', 'affairs', 'order', 'prepare', 'funeral.And', 'when', 'use', 'word', 'affairs', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'mean', 'finances', 'legal', 'stuff', 'Matt', 'soon', 'daughter', 'was', ""n't"", 'only', 'imperfect', 'spouse', 'family', 'shocked', 'learn', 'exactly', 'what', 'wife', 'was', 'up', 'last', 'months.With', 'help', 'family', 'one', 'two', 'hangers-on', 'Matt', 'things', 'rest', 'course', 'movie', 'resulting', 'situations', 'are', 'funny', 'sad', 'moving', 'sometimes', 'ridiculous', 'always', 'very', 'human', 'interesting', 'Matt', 'forgiveness', 'wife', 'infidelity', 'fairly', 'early', 'residual', 'anger', 'surfaces', 'here', 'there', 'work', 'be', 'done', 'what', 'learned', 'determined', 'put', 'wife', 'rest', 'dignity', 'love', 'honor', 'memory', 'properly', 'friends', 'family.Filling', 'out', 'movie', 'are', 'beautiful', 'locations', 'Hawaii', 'quirky', 'subplot', 'involving', 'Matt', 'Alexandra', 'trying', 'locate', 'Elizabeth', 'secret', 'lover', 'negative', 'feelings', 'part', 'life', 'want', 'give', 'guy', 'opportunity', 'properly', 'say', 'goodbye', 'subplot', 'involving', 'major', 'land', 'deal', 'being', 'overseen', 'Matt', 'ultimately', 'movie', 'theme', 'identifying', 'what', 'really', 'important', 'life.In', 'end', 'Descendents', 'involving', 'family', 'drama', 'honestly', 'emotions', 'forth', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'premise', 'scare', 'off', ""'ll"", 'likely', 'leave', 'film', 'feeling', 'upbeat', 'chatty', 'ready', 'discuss', 'film', 'humor', 'humanity']",The Descendants
1429135,A2R1YK3THA0RB3,B004UXUX4Q,Josh,"[1, 1]","I will start out by saying two things. One, this movie is not entirely fiction. What i mean is, the situation and conflict present in The Descendants does happen from time to time in the real world. Two, Despite the ONE con I have, this passively honest movie gets a solid A+ in my book.The movie stars George Clooney as Matt King, Shailene Woodley as his daughter Alexandra, Judy Greer as his wife Julie, and Matthew Lillard as Brian Speer. George Clooney was terrific, Shailene Woodley was excellent and the remaining supporting cast did his/her job exceptionally well. I also really admired the scenery and where the movie was shot. There are just gorgeous set pieces and settings in the movie that go well with the overall tone. The story line has a strong message and shows some of the struggles of how to be a parent.My only con with the movie is there is so much profanity. And I know there are those who will say things like ""well what about this movie?"" or ""well this movie has curse words too!'' And the movie IS rated R so obviously, I would not highly recommend this for younger children.Is The Descendants a perfect movie? No but it is very close.

1429136,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B004UXUX4Q,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[1, 4]","The Descendants marks Alexander Payne's return to directing after a seven year absence and before The Artist stole its thunder it was considered the Oscar front-runner in the Best Picture and Best Actor categories. In the end, it won the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. Critically speaking, it's quite the comeback. In almost 20 years Payne has directed only five films, all from screenplays co-written with his writing partner Jim Taylor. This is the first film the two have not collaborated on the script for, although Taylor remains a producer and Payne's consistency remains as well. As a director, Payne has displayed a unique style that functions through the acting, editing, music, camera work, and writing. That style that was so prevalent in Election, About Schmidt, and Sideways is not as prominent here. It has that quirky Payne-humor coupled with heartwrenching drama, but I wonder if Payne chose to play it safe for his comeback. It obviously worked for him in most circles, but this being his most commercial, straight-forward, and safe effort left me underwhelmed. Payne still deftly blends poignant drama with just the right dose of comedy, once again giving us one of the best films of last year. I just say this with less enthusiasm than I have had for his previous films.The Descendants is based on the novel by Kaui Hart Hemmings and was shot on location in Hawaii. George Clooney plays Matt King, a lawyer and the sole trustee of untouched Hawaiian land. With the trust set to expire in seven years, Matt is in the middle of a big deal to sell the land when his wife Elizabeth is involved in a boating accident that puts her in a coma. A dire prognosis forces Matt, who has always been the ""back-up parent,"" to take charge in caring for his two daughters, 10-year-old Scottie (Amara Miller) and 17-year-old Alex (Shailene Woodley). His relationship with Alex is already strained when she reveals a secret about her comatose mother that unravels Matt's entire life.The beautiful Hawaiian setting adds an ironic contrast to the heavy material. Like any film shot in Hawaii this is beautiful to look at, but the scenery takes a backseat to the involving and touching story. There's a good reason Payne is on the short list of filmmakers retaining final cut privileges to their films. He's a master at handling heavy dramatic subjects with subtlety and humor, while demonstrating a firm grasp on characters and their development. This is a very consistent film with several wonderful scenes. Look at the beautifully acted confrontation between Clooney and Matthew Lillard. It's a bittersweet, tense scene, heartfelt and funny that reveals Lillard as an effective, underutilized talent. He plays this scene to perfection, never over-playing it and finding the perfect balance of guilt, fear, and regret.There's a character named Sid (played by Nick Krause), who shows up doing his best Keanu Reeves impression and seemingly has no role in the story except to accompany Alex and frustrate Matt. Never one to stick to conventions, Payne builds this character to a surprisingly poignant moment with Matt that feels remarkably sincere when it would've seemed contrived in the hands of a lesser writer/director. Finally, Matt's goodbye to his wife is one of the most quietly moving scenes of any film last year. It's a brief, beautiful moment; understated, despite being the film's emotional climax.Robert Forster and Beau Bridges do memorable turns with very few scenes, while Lillard emerges from his permanent spot as Shaggy in anything Scooby-Doo related to show off unexpected range. Miller and Woodley are terrific as the daughters, particularly the 20-year-old Woodley who gives a performance that blows many of her contemporaries out of the water. It announces the emergence of a bright young actress, who is wasting her talent on that unfortunate television show.Clooney, meanwhile, gives his most mature performance to date and certainly one of his best. It's a far cry from the suave, deliriously handsome characters he usually plays. His performance as Matt King is quiet, heartbreaking, and without an ounce of bravado. It shows him in a completely different light. That scene between Matt and his comatose wife is real, powerful acting. Out of the five Best Actor nominees, Clooney was no doubt the runner-up.The Descendants is professionally-made, high-quality melodrama that never diverges into new territory and only separates itself from the pack with Payne's offbeat blend of the comic and tragic. It doesn't rank too highly on the list, but it is one of 2011's best films despite the faint scent of Oscar-bait that surrounds the entire movie and its failure to make the same impact of Payne's previous work. It may not be profound, but it's hard to dislike or not be affected by. It's a melancholy, pleasing effort that I just don't foresee being discussed years from now. Even with these shortcomings, it has heart and is a welcome return from Alexander Payne and a nice change of pace for George Clooney.",4,High-Quality Melodrama Featuring George Clooney's Most Mature

If you liked this movie and are offended by an individul who did not, then please refrain from reading any review that is rated less than 5-stars.I didn't enjoy this film for a number of reasons. First, is Hollywood's insistence on portraying teenagers as thoroughly unlikable and disrespectful. I found it irritating that George Clooney's character allowed his daughters to use the f-word, refer to eachother as ""motherless whores"", ""twats"", etc. and basically carry on like deliquents.This is typical Hollywood: all teenagers are mouthy little twerps and the parents sigh, and seem incapable of behaving like actual adults. Instead, they are portrayed as harrassed, weary, and impotent.The viewer is led to assume that the father has been absent for much of his childrens' lives. Oddly, though, he never seems to work once his wife becomes comatose. Where did his work load go? What happened to his legal cases? No matter, we're not supposed to wonder about that. We're also not supposed to feel incredulous when George Clooney's character allows his daughter's moronic and rude boy friend to tag along on the family's journeys. We're also not to question why a husband, who is about to lose his wife and mother to his children, would spend so much time tracking down her former lover. To what end? For what purpose? I like George Clooney, but his character in this film is flat and one-dimensional. Finally, the extras in this film are so bad, delivering their lines in a dead-pan, amaterish way that reminded one of watching high-school performances.

1429145,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B004UXUX4Q,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[179, 206]","It seems hard to believe that it's been seven years since Alexander Payne's ""Sideways"" became the critical darling of 2004. Nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and winning Payne an Adapted Screenplay Oscar--that picture (along with Election and About Schmidt) signaled a talented filmmaker with an unorthodox worldview. Blending elements of comedy and drama, Payne has crafted complex characters simultaneously frustrating and sympathetic--but altogether real. In adapting Kaui Hart Hemmings' intimate novel ""The Descendants"" to the big screen, Payne demonstrates (once again) a deft balance of emotions to create a picture both funny and heartbreaking. I so admired how Payne made vineyards and fine wines a major component, an extra character really, in the sublime ""Sideways."" In much the same way, Hawaii is a principle character (and I would contend one of the most pivotal) to ""The Descendents."" It would be easy to imagine someone jettisoning much of this rich texture, but Payne has crafted a loving tribute to the state's heritage in addition to one of the year's most surprising family dramas.George Clooney plays one of the titular descendants, someone whose family has great historical significance to the Hawaiian Islands. In fact, he and his many cousins own a great tract of undeveloped land that plays a major role in the film's fascinating side story. Front and center, however, is a more personal tale of family dysfunction and pulling together in crisis. When Clooney's somewhat estranged wife is incapacitated in an accident, Clooney must take charge of his troublesome teenage daughter (an astute Shailene Woodley) and his rebellious younger girl (an appealingly unexpected Amara Miller). With mom in a coma, Clooney is left to do his best to reconnect with the girls that he hasn't made enough time for. While this seems to be leading to some routine comic hijinks, the film takes a decidedly more serious turn as Clooney learns about his wife's true feelings. The rest of the movie walks the tightrope about how he and his daughters can channel these revelations and emerge stronger for it. And the film runs the gamut of emotions with anger, betrayal, love, and regret sharing equal time as the family embarks on a tumultuous journey together.While I know this makes the film sound like a bit of a downer, there is much humor to be enjoyed as well. While I'm confident that many will reveal far more about the plot than I am willing to, I think that it is best to let the story unravel without expectation. This is very much an in-depth character study. As such, Clooney has one of his most rewarding roles. He goes through a lot, but he maintains a subtlety that always keeps the picture grounded (even in its more extreme elements). Woodley is a revelation and this is as far a departure from TV's ""The Secret Life of the American Teenager"" as she's likely to experience. I'm confident we'll be seeing more of her. Miller has a real ease and provides many well placed laughs and a few tears as well. Perhaps the film's biggest secret weapon is Nick Krause playing Woodley's friend. As a laconic and laid back surfer dude, Krause's scenes with Clooney have real impact. As an odd source of wisdom and support, he is a unique character in this piece.""The Descendants,"" at the end of the day, is a quiet and thoughtful film. The film never plays up the huge emotional moments or strains for melodrama. It simply lets the characters exist as complex creations, with all their foibles and flaws in evidence. Its understated power, therefore, is all the more successful as it feels patently real. A treat for adult movie goers, 4 1/2 stars.

He's never been interested in taking the easy way out, however. In his latest film, ""The Descendants,"" he plays a troubled lawyer in Paradise, that is, Hawai'i. (One of the many pleasures of ""The Descendants"" is the pervasive but never intrusive presence, through scenery and music, of the distinctive culture of the state.)Matt King is not your everyday attorney--he is a descendant of one of the island state's oldest and richest families, and the trustee of the family estate on Kaua'i, overseeing an impending sale that will make his and all of his numerous relatives' fortunes. In the meantime his personal life is falling apart--his wife Elizabeth is in a coma after a boating accident, and his two daughters, to whom he has, by his own admission, been ""the understudy--the backup parent,"" are both acting out in reaction to the tragedy. As he tries to hold his family together, Matt is further buffeted by revelations concerning his troubled marriage and its wholly unexpected effect on the upcoming business deal.Directed by Anthony Payne, who helmed the sleeper ""Sideways"" a few years back, ""The Descendants"" possesses the same knack for drawing easy laughs from the viewer, then delivering sucker punches of emotion just when one's defenses are down. Clooney catches the look of old Hawaiian money to perfection, his handsome visage weathered and weary, stumping around in shorts and aloha shirts. He delivers a memorable performance both facially, in a quiet private speech to his unhearing wife, and physically, in a burst of angry speed as he runs to confront friends who have withheld crucial information from him. However fine the actor is (and the award nominations are already rolling in), he is only the primary player in a strong cast. Shailene Woodley matches him scene for scene as his tense, wary elder daughter Alex, and veteran actors Beau Bridges, Robert Forster, and Michael Ontkean (how long since we've seen him?) turn up, comfortable as old shoes, in subsidiary roles. More prominently, Judy Greer and Matthew Lillard deliver sterling performances as a couple whose lives end up colliding with Matt's.""The Descendants"" is not a flawless piece of film making--there is a lot of exposition supplied via voice-over narration, and even so there is not enough backstory supplied about either Matt's and Elizabeth's marriage or the business deal that forms the backdrop against which the personal story unfolds. Early on, Alex gains a male friend (not a boyfriend), Sid (Nick Krause), whose presence is ultimately justified in a rather contrived, though admittedly touching, fashion. Still, the loose ends confirm one of the film's themes--that there is a lot in life that is left unsaid, sometimes until it's too late.

We have the main character's conflict in selling his family's land, complicated by an unintended benefit to the man his wife cheated with if he sells to the buyer who will &#34;keep the money in Hawaii.&#34; There is the problem of dealing with a dying spouse in a vegetative state, who was just discovered to be unfaithful, along with the father-in-law who doesn't know, and cannot be told, what his daughter did. We have the excitement of the hunt as the Clooney character tries to track down his wife's lover. There's the daughter's teenage boyfriend, who first comes across as superficial, but by the film's end is revealed to have more going on. The beautiful locations and the various plot lines combine to produce a film that is engaging but thin. There is one great line where George Clooney says that you should give your children enough money so that they can do what they want, but not so much that they don't have to do anything. That's not an exact quote; he said it much better. The film is enjoyable but doesn't make any major points or offer any great catharsis.

I watched it three times this weekend.There are many synopses of the film, so read another review for the plotline.  With Alexander Payne at the helm and George Clooney in the lead, I had very high expectations for this film.  The actual product even exceeded those expectations.  The characters drawn full and as we humans are, flawed.  I especially liked that the youngest child didn't fall into the cute and precocious trap that is the usual timeworn device for such.  The plotline is well-crafted and avoids the obvious cliches that this story could have easily fallen into.  The dialog is just about perfect.  These people talk like well, ""real people.""There are a couple of hallmarks of the Alexander Payne films that I have seen that again are evident in this film.  One, very quickly the viewer knows who the characters are - I mean really KNOWS who these people are.  Payne is able carry this through many of the supporting characters as well.  I don't know how he does it, but his characters are established to the viewer very soon after they first appear.  The other thing Payne does is create almost unbelievable situations and make them seem feasible.  If we saw them written in a story or saw them realized in less-adroit hands, some of his plotlines would be laughable - and not in a good way. In Payne's hands, we simply accept them because he makes them so plausable within the context of the storyline.One of the most genius moves was to place this story in Hawaii. Against a backdrop most would consider the destination of a lifetime, yes, the denizens have the same problems, the same heartbreaks, the same joys those of us living in less-stunning settings do.There are some movies that I enjoy as I would an old friend, welcoming them back again and again.

This movie is just so well-written and acted that I was willing to go through the experience. And in a way it is about anti-escapism, set as it is in Hawaii, with George Clooney's character bitterly noting in the opening voiceover that his friends on the mainland think his life must be heaven, living in paradise as he does, but don't they realize that people still suffer, and break each other's hearts, and die?For those who don't know, the plot of this movie (although 'plot' is not quite the right word) is that Clooney's character's wife is in a coma, and soon to be dead. He has to deal with this, and the reality of their troubled marriage which he will now never get to save, along with explaining it to his troubled daughters, ages 10 and 17, other family members, and friends. There is also a backstory involving valuable land his family owns, and is considering selling. I don't want to give everything away, but the essence is that this is a rich and quirky cast of characters, where no one is perfect and everyone is struggling to understand what is happening and how to connect, and forgive.The writing, the acting, the tone and the filming are all exactly right.

I think he does very well in roles like Up in the Air which exploit those characteristics, but here where deep feelings should be conveyed, though this character is rather low key and de/repressed, he fails. I couldn't help but think how good William Hurt  [brilliant at playing undemonstrative characters who have much brewing inside ] would have been in this role. Additionally, the film begins with Clooney's wife's coma and so fails to draw the viewer in, simply by not providing back story. We don't see any scenes from the marriage--and so we have no emotional investment in it or the characters.In any case, when Clooney finds out his wife was having an affair, he takes his two messed up daughters to Kauai, where the lover is vacationing with his charming family, ostensibly to give the man a chance to say a last goodbye to the wife who is on life support. There is a subplot about a land sale on the island, a last mega million parcel belonging to Clooney's extended family which will be sold and developed into a resort.Here the movie is stolen by both the betrayed wife [ Judy Greer ] and Clooney's cousin played by the brilliant Beau Bridges. Bridges has about seven minutes of screen time, and yet, is so good that I knew who this man was and could imagine his entire back story just with what he did with his body language, intonation and physical appearance.The movie is okay, the Hawaiian islands are pretty, but it is neither a comedy nor an enlightening commentary on human affairs.

The ""Descendants"" was a surprisingly warm, entertaining and thoughtful film. It deals specifically with a family going through a specific tragedy and dealing with that tragedy and all the secrets they never knew existed.George Clooney pulls an emotionally charged and compassionate performance as a father dealing with his wife and her near fatal accident. (Played by Patricia Hastie of ""Lost"", basically playing a invalided accident victim - no dialogue at all.)  He needs to deal with the solitude of losing a wife and dealing with estranged children who are remarkably good actors themselves. The oldest daughter is played by Shailene Woodley (""The OC"", ""Secret Life Of An American Teenager"")  and the youngest daughter  played by Amara Miller (in her very first project ever).What made this movie so good for me was the complexity of Clooney's character and the depth he went to in order to deal with a big family secret, an estranged daughter, a curious daughter and a dying wife. It felt real and heartwarming to see his friends and a new real estate agent and his wife literally turn his world upside down!  Try keeping a dry eye during this film.The movie feature a completely Hawaiian underscore with classic songs and ukulele strums as well as a realistic look at life in the modern day Hawaiian Islands. The greenery, the land, the ocean and even the never seen rural areas of middle-class homes - all are woven in such detail as to only enhance the story.The cast includes some other incredible performances by Mathew Lillard (""Scooby Doo"", ""Madd TV"") , Judy Greer (""What Women Want', ""13 Going on 30"")  and Beau Bridges (""Fabulous Baker Boys"", ""Stargate"").Overall this movie has a lot to offer. Real-life drama and passion and the only thing that might be off setting is that the ""R"" rating for this movie is because of the language. (Which includes the kids.) I can see why it's winning all the awards and the fact it is currently up for  five Academy Award Nominations including;  Actor In a Leading Role - George Clooney, Best Picture, Directing -Alexander Payne, Film Editing - Kevin Tent, and Writing (Adapted Screenplay) - Alexander Payne, Nat Faxon and Jim Rash.A very well made film.",5,Clooney Has Another Wonderful Film,1328572800,"02 7, 2012",2012,2356,"['MOVIE', 'REVIEW', '20', 'DescendantsAlexander', 'Payne', 'director', 'couple', 'favorite', 'independent', 'films', 'Sideways', 'Election', 'done', 'again', 'Descendants', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'warm', 'entertaining', 'thoughtful', 'film', 'specifically', 'family', 'going', 'specific', 'tragedy', 'dealing', 'tragedy', 'secrets', 'never', 'knew', 'existed.George', 'Clooney', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'compassionate', 'performance', 'father', 'dealing', 'wife', 'near', 'fatal', 'accident', 'Played', 'Patricia', 'Hastie', 'Lost', 'basically', 'playing', 'invalided', 'accident', 'victim', 'dialogue', 'deal', 'solitude', 'losing', 'wife', 'dealing', 'estranged', 'children', 'who', 'are', 'remarkably', 'good', 'actors', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'played', 'Shailene', 'Woodley', 'OC', 'Secret', 'Life', 'American', 'Teenager', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'played', 'Amara', 'Miller', 'very', 'first', 'project', 'ever', '.What', 'made', 'movie', 'so', 'good', 'was', 'complexity', 'Clooney', 'character', 'depth', 'went', 'order', 'deal', 'big', 'family', 'secret', 'estranged', 'daughter', 'curious', 'daughter', 'dying', 'wife', 'felt', 'real', 'heartwarming', 'see', 'friends', 'new', 'real', 'estate', 'agent', 'wife', 'literally', 'turn', 'world', 'upside', 'down', 'Try', 'keeping', 'dry', 'eye', 'film.The', 'movie', 'feature', 'completely', 'Hawaiian', 'underscore', 'classic', 'songs', 'ukulele', 'strums', 'as', 'well', 'realistic', 'look', 'life', 'modern', 'day', 'Hawaiian', 'Islands', 'greenery', 'land', 'ocean', 'even', 'never', 'seen', 'rural', 'areas', 'middle-class', 'homes', 'are', 'woven', 'such', 'detail', 'only', 'enhance', 'story.The', 'cast', 'other', 'incredible', 'performances', 'Mathew', 'Lillard', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'Madd', 'TV', 'Judy', 'Greer', 'What', 'Women', 'Want', '13', 'Going', '30', 'Beau', 'Bridges', 'Fabulous', 'Baker', 'Boys', 'Stargate', 'movie', 'lot', 'offer', 'Real-life', 'drama', 'passion', 'only', 'thing', 'might', 'be', 'off', 'setting', 'R', 'rating', 'movie', 'language', 'kids', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'winning', 'awards', 'fact', 'currently', 'five', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Nominations', 'including', 'Actor', 'Leading', 'Role', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Directing', '-Alexander', 'Payne', 'Film', 'Editing', 'Kevin', 'Tent', 'Writing', 'Adapted', 'Screenplay', 'Alexander', 'Payne', 'Nat', 'Faxon', 'Jim', 'Rash.A', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'film']",The Descendants

He happens to be wealthy because of his descent from the original landowners of Hawaii, the real Hawaiians, who own most of Hawaii. Sole trustee of the family's interests, and now because of succession rules faced with the situation of having to sell off thousands of acres of pristine land to resort developers. Despite his family wealth Doug leads a very modest life. He drives a metallic silver Honda Civic, a sensible car.When his thrillseeking wife ends up in a coma following a powerboating accident, he is thrust into the unfamiliar role of looking after his two daughters each bringing their own challenges. The younger one has difficulties in school, the older one, well, she's a teenager.We learn early in the movie that the wife had an affair, making a difficult situation even worse. George Clooney Alex Payne manage to create apposite emotions for the movie goer. While distressed he pads out the front door, dons flipflops and runs to his wife's best friend house. He runs funny. A comic relief followed by a dramatic confrontation. Tension, and shock artfully modified by humor make this movie an emotional wonder.When he breaks the news of his wife's condition to his older daughter she ducks underwater and we see an invisible breakdown. Some of these scenes are tender. In the hospital there are various monologues to the comatose mother, from a cheated husband, an unforgiving daughter, and a wounded wife.The presence of Clooney vastly elevates the movie, as does the acting performance of Shailene Woodley, giving a tremendous breakthrough performance as the teenage daughter you worry might go off the rails. Judy Greer, who you probably know from Two and a Half Men appears later in the movie.The Descendants is among the leading Oscar nominated movies. Although nine movies are nominated for Best Picture, only three I believe are genuine contenders, The Artist, and Hugo being the other two. Nominations for The Descendants include Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Adapted Screenplay.Previously, Alex Payne won the Academy Award for the Sideways screenplay.Based onThe Descendants: A Novel (Random House Movie Tie-In Books)by Kaui Hart Hemmings.Now Payne has won his second Academy award for Best Adapted Screenplay.I think you will enjoy one of the years best movies, and I hope this was helpful.",5,Aloha Hawaii,1330473600,"02 29, 2012",2012,2998,"['Director', 'Alexander', 'Payne', 'previously', 'directed', 'movies', 'such', 'cult', 'classicElectionn', 'starring', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'own', 'Schmidtstarring', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'andSidewaysstarring', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'nominated', 'five', 'Oscars', 'winning', 'one.Gregory', 'Peck', 'once', 'said', 'hard', 'make', 'good', 'man', 'look', 'interesting.You', 'can', 'probably', 'imagine', 'cinematic', 'world', 'peopled', 'antiheroes', 'flawed', 'heroes', 'unrealistic', 'superheroes', 'how', 'refreshing', 'might', 'be', 'encounter', 'good', 'guy', 'can', 'relate', 'situations', 'parallel', 'might', 'actually', 'experience.George', 'Clooney', 'plays', 'Matt', 'King', 'lawyer', 'businessman', 'hardworking', 'mostly', 'absent', 'father', 'two', 'girls', 'be', 'wealthy', 'descent', 'original', 'landowners', 'Hawaii', 'real', 'Hawaiians', 'who', 'own', 'most', 'Hawaii', 'Sole', 'trustee', 'family', 'interests', 'now', 'succession', 'rules', 'faced', 'situation', 'having', 'sell', 'off', 'thousands', 'acres', 'pristine', 'land', 'resort', 'developers', 'family', 'wealth', 'Doug', 'very', 'modest', 'life', 'metallic', 'silver', 'Honda', 'Civic', 'sensible', 'car.When', 'thrillseeking', 'wife', 'up', 'coma', 'following', 'powerboating', 'accident', 'thrust', 'unfamiliar', 'role', 'looking', 'two', 'daughters', 'bringing', 'own', 'challenges', 'younger', 'one', 'difficulties', 'school', 'older', 'one', 'well', 'teenager.We', 'learn', 'early', 'movie', 'wife', 'had', 'affair', 'making', 'difficult', 'situation', 'even', 'worse', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Alex', 'Payne', 'manage', 'create', 'apposite', 'emotions', 'movie', 'goer', 'distressed', 'out', 'front', 'door', 'dons', 'flipflops', 'wife', 'best', 'friend', 'house', 'funny', 'comic', 'relief', 'followed', 'dramatic', 'confrontation', 'Tension', 'shock', 'artfully', 'modified', 'humor', 'make', 'movie', 'emotional', 'wonder.When', 'news', 'wife', 'condition', 'older', 'daughter', 'underwater', 'see', 'invisible', 'breakdown', 'scenes', 'are', 'tender', 'hospital', 'are', 'various', 'monologues', 'comatose', 'mother', 'cheated', 'husband', 'unforgiving', 'daughter', 'wounded', 'wife.The', 'presence', 'Clooney', 'vastly', 'movie', 'acting', 'performance', 'Shailene', 'Woodley', 'giving', 'tremendous', 'breakthrough', 'performance', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'worry', 'might', 'go', 'off', 'rails', 'Judy', 'Greer', 'who', 'probably', 'know', 'Two', 'Half', 'Men', 'later', 'movie.The', 'Descendants', 'leading', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'movies', 'nine', 'movies', 'are', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Picture', 'only', 'three', 'believe', 'are', 'genuine', 'contenders', 'Artist', 'Hugo', 'being', 'other', 'two', 'Nominations', 'Descendants', 'include', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Director', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Best', 'Adapted', 'Screenplay.Previously', 'Alex', 'Payne', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Sideways', 'screenplay.Based', 'onThe', 'Descendants', 'Novel', 'Random', 'House', 'Movie', 'Tie-In', 'Books', 'Kaui', 'Hart', 'Hemmings.Now', 'Payne', 'won', 'second', 'Academy', 'award', 'Best', 'Adapted', 'Screenplay.I', 'think', 'will', 'enjoy', 'one', 'years', 'best', 'movies', 'hope', 'was', 'helpful']",The Descendants

1429174,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B004UXUX4Q,MadMacs,"[0, 0]","The single most accurate film about Hawaii that I've ever seen. Bar none. And I'm still stunned.Too often the portrayal, without malice, falsely depicts some kind of wondrous, spiritual and exotic locale. It's not. Not really, or at least not entirely. It's a state in the Union Of The United States. No better or worse than any other of the other 49, notable only for the fact that it's a series of islands sitting in the middle of a vast ocean. The film honestly depicts the congestion - of cars, pollution and people - and the shocking amount of concrete that is paving over much of what used to be ""Old Hawaii"". Clooney's character, Matthew King, opens with a prologue that includes, ""Are...our cancers less fatal, our heartache less painful?"". Exactly.It's a revelatory and moving film that successfully grasps subtle local themes and issues - many of which malahini won't understand. Not that any of that is an impediment to enjoying this amazing movie.However, here are a couple of examples:- The amalgamation of several prominent Missionary Families here in the islands represented by the fictional King clan. Some of which, like the film, are divided about their moral and legal obligations. A tarnished heritage that bestows great wealth to a select few, while simultaneously exposing their lost connection to the people and the 'aina. Often, carrying a blood lineage associated to Cooke, Bishop, Castle, etc., tends to foster a conflicted mixture of admiration, envy and anger amongst the people who actually live in Hawaii and call it home.Interestingly, the Kings, at least from my perspective, are likely a representation of the Sinclair-Robinsons. Their internal family debate in the 1990's, regarding stewardship of an entire island, sparked a statewide discussion about hereditary landholders and their relationship to the greater community.- Another aspect which I deeply appreciated: When Matt announces to a gathering of friends that he will follow his wife's wishes to be removed from life support - all of them are caucasian. It would've hollowed this film tremendously if Director Payne had attempted to display some shibai it's-a-small-world-after-all cosmopolitan show of skin colors to appease the politically correct. I'm grateful that it was honest.And honesty is what this film is all about. Whether it's the cultural rift between the haves and have-nots, and the racial divide that often represent the same groups. Or the tangled human relationships we have with one another, often repressing an ugliness we would rather not confront, 'Descendants' truly delves and explores these often sublime and gray issues.Tremendously deep, with so many layers of dramatic construction, it's almost indescribable without writing a thesis about the islands and our ohana. Every time you think you have it and the characters down, the story unexpectedly wheels and turns, and suddenly you're looking at a completely different film. Really, sincerely, this is a phenomenal movie.Absolutely five stars.Personal Notes:- Regarding Clooney - 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' will always be my favorite performance of the man, but this comes so awfully close to topping it. His deilvery as an absentee-dad and distanced husband was about as complete a character as I've seen in a long time. Neither hero nor villain, but like most people, a mix of something in between.- Was enchanted by Shailene Woodley, who carried the difficult and critical role of daughter Alexandra King. And along with Saorise Ronan, an impressive young actress whom I'll be watching.- Wasn't sure who Alexander Payne was, so in doing an IMDb reference check, I realized that I had indeed screened an earlier work. As I think back on it, I wasn't particularly impressed with 'Sideways', but I wonder now if I misjudged the film. Based on the incredible detail he captured in this film, and given that I'm not familiar with California wine country, I'll have to set time aside to rescreen that earlier production.",5,Tremendously Deep With Many Layers Of Dramatic Construction,1332979200,"03 29, 2012",2012,3993,"['single', 'most', 'accurate', 'film', 'Hawaii', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Bar', 'none', ""'m"", 'still', 'stunned.Too', 'often', 'portrayal', 'malice', 'falsely', 'kind', 'wondrous', 'spiritual', 'exotic', 'locale', 'not', 'Not', 'really', 'least', 'not', 'entirely', 'state', 'Union', 'United', 'States', 'better', 'worse', 'other', 'other', '49', 'notable', 'only', 'fact', 'series', 'islands', 'sitting', 'middle', 'vast', 'ocean', 'film', 'honestly', 'congestion', 'cars', 'pollution', 'people', 'shocking', 'amount', 'concrete', 'paving', 'over', 'much', 'what', 'used', 'be', 'Old', 'Hawaii', 'Clooney', 'character', 'Matthew', 'King', 'prologue', 'Are', 'cancers', 'less', 'fatal', 'heartache', 'less', 'painful', 'Exactly.It', 'revelatory', 'moving', 'film', 'successfully', 'grasps', 'subtle', 'local', 'themes', 'issues', 'many', 'malahini', 'wo', ""n't"", 'understand', 'Not', 'impediment', 'enjoying', 'amazing', 'movie.However', 'here', 'are', 'couple', 'examples', 'amalgamation', 'several', 'prominent', 'Missionary', 'Families', 'here', 'islands', 'represented', 'fictional', 'King', 'clan', 'film', 'are', 'divided', 'moral', 'legal', 'obligations', 'tarnished', 'heritage', 'great', 'wealth', 'select', 'few', 'simultaneously', 'exposing', 'lost', 'connection', 'people', ""'aina"", 'Often', 'carrying', 'blood', 'lineage', 'associated', 'Cooke', 'Bishop', 'Castle', 'etc.', 'foster', 'conflicted', 'mixture', 'admiration', 'envy', 'anger', 'amongst', 'people', 'who', 'actually', 'live', 'Hawaii', 'call', 'home.Interestingly', 'Kings', 'least', 'perspective', 'are', 'likely', 'representation', 'Sinclair-Robinsons', 'internal', 'family', 'debate', '1990', 'regarding', 'stewardship', 'entire', 'island', 'sparked', 'statewide', 'discussion', 'hereditary', 'landholders', 'relationship', 'greater', 'community.-', 'aspect', 'deeply', 'appreciated', 'When', 'Matt', 'gathering', 'friends', 'will', 'follow', 'wife', 'wishes', 'be', 'removed', 'life', 'support', 'are', 'caucasian', 'would', ""'ve"", 'hollowed', 'film', 'tremendously', 'Director', 'Payne', 'had', 'attempted', 'display', 'shibai', ""it's-a-small-world-after-all"", 'cosmopolitan', 'show', 'skin', 'colors', 'appease', 'politically', 'correct', ""'m"", 'grateful', 'was', 'honest.And', 'honesty', 'what', 'film', 'cultural', 'rift', 'haves', 'have-nots', 'racial', 'divide', 'often', 'represent', 'same', 'groups', 'tangled', 'human', 'relationships', 'have', 'one', 'often', 'repressing', 'ugliness', 'would', 'rather', 'not', 'confront', ""'Descendants"", 'truly', 'delves', 'often', 'sublime', 'gray', 'issues.Tremendously', 'deep', 'so', 'many', 'layers', 'dramatic', 'construction', 'almost', 'indescribable', 'writing', 'thesis', 'islands', 'ohana', 'time', 'think', 'have', 'characters', 'down', 'story', 'unexpectedly', 'wheels', 'turns', 'suddenly', ""'re"", 'looking', 'completely', 'different', 'film', 'Really', 'sincerely', 'phenomenal', 'movie.Absolutely', 'five', 'stars.Personal', 'Notes', 'Regarding', 'Clooney', 'O', 'Brother', 'Where', 'Art', 'Thou', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'favorite', 'performance', 'man', 'so', 'awfully', 'close', 'topping', 'deilvery', 'absentee-dad', 'distanced', 'husband', 'was', 'complete', 'character', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'hero', 'villain', 'most', 'people', 'mix', 'something', 'between.-', 'Was', 'enchanted', 'Shailene', 'Woodley', 'who', 'carried', 'difficult', 'critical', 'role', 'daughter', 'Alexandra', 'King', 'Saorise', 'Ronan', 'impressive', 'young', 'actress', 'whom', ""'ll"", 'be', 'watching.-', 'Was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'who', 'Alexander', 'Payne', 'was', 'so', 'doing', 'IMDb', 'reference', 'check', 'realized', 'had', 'indeed', 'screened', 'earlier', 'work', 'think', 'back', 'was', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'impressed', ""'Sideways"", 'wonder', 'now', 'misjudged', 'film', 'Based', 'incredible', 'detail', 'captured', 'film', 'given', ""'m"", 'not', 'familiar', 'California', 'wine', 'country', ""'ll"", 'have', 'set', 'time', 'rescreen', 'earlier', 'production']",The Descendants

I did enjoy the film, and it's certainly another more than competent effort from director Alexander Payne (""Election,"" ""About Schmidt,"" ""Sideways"") who hasn't disappointed yet. But I have to wonder at the movie's stellar reputation which doesn't seem to me to live up to all the hype. This is why I rate it four stars instead of five.All that having been said, I think the most interesting question here, given all the glowingly positive reviews and the very few negative ones, is why the movie seems to have struck such a responsive chord with the viewing public. And I think I have as good a theory as any about that. As hundreds of reviewers have already commented on the usual movie topics such as the acting, direction, script, plot, and so on, I'll mainly discuss this idea since I've read quite a few of the reviews here and I didn't see anyone else discuss this so far.The movie starts with  a voice-over of Clooney musing about ""life in paradise"" and wondering how people can think it's any different from anywhere else--people are the same, they have all the same problems--the only difference is that in Hawaii they have them in paradise. Clooney comments that people seem to think Hawaiians just sit on the beach or surf and drink mai tai's all day long, and that life is always idyllic.  ""Are they insane?"" Clooney asks. LOLAnd I think that right there sums up the appeal of this movie. The Germans have a word, ""schadenfreude,"" which means ""taking pleasure in the suffering of others."" And I think the appeal of this movie has exactly to do with that. I suspect Americans in general envy those who get to live in Hawaii, and this story about a dysfunctional family and the tragic situation which the family has to deal with, all set against the backdrop of the beautiful Hawaiian landscape, appealed to the public by showing that people in Hawaii can be just as miserable, and their lives can be just as screwed up, as everywhere else.In the case of Clooney's family, they might live in a natural paradise, but his family life is anything but. The kids are insolent and disobedient, use foul language inappropriate to children, court the wrong friends (mainly Alex, the teenage daughter, whose current flame is an oafish boor), and are in general constantly misbehaving and disrespectful of Clooney, the hapless father, who's just trying to get everyone through a very stressful and difficult time for the family.Yup, it's not exactly paradise; in fact, if you take away the location, it's more like hell: Clooney is miserable, the kids are miserable, the relatives are just lazing about hoping to cash in on Clooney's land deal, (spoiler alert!) his wife is dying, and on top of all this, Clooney finds out that his wife was cheating on him before she had her fatal boating accident. Oh, and did I mention the father-in-law has no respect for Clooney either?

Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[1, 3]","""The Descendants"" is going to be a really big disappointment to people who think that life should mirror the kind of interactions you see on ""Jerry Springer"" or that every movie should include gun fights or car chases. I'll go ahead and drop this spoiler: there is hardly a whiff of any of the above.George Clooney plays Matt King, a lawyer in Hawai'i whose family is partially descended from King Kamehameha. Although they're now ""about as Haole as you can get"", the family still has the rights to a beautiful and large tract of prime real estate on Kaua'i. As the movie opens the family is contemplating a big decision: the rest of the family are not successful Honolulu lawyers and selling the land will set up the rest of the family nicely.But the real estate plot plays in the background for the main storyline. As the film opens Matt's wife is in a coma that occurred in a boating accident off Waikiki. The Doctor tells Matt in the opening scene that it is hopeless - Elizabeth King shows no evidence of brain activity and her living will instructs everyone to discontinue life support. The Doctor tells Matt to let everyone know so they can say good-bye.This begins an emotional Odyssey for Clooney's character. There are two King Daughters: Ten year old Scottie, played by Amara Miller, who is acting out and having difficulty at school after Mom's accident, and seventeen year old Alexandra, played by Shailene Woodley, who was apparently having difficulty before the accident. Alex has been shipped to a boarding school and she is none too eager to reconcile with Dad or cut Mom any slack just because of a little coma. Robert Forster is realistically gruff and bitter as the father of comatose Elizabeth - he blames Matt for being a neglectful husband - driving Elizabeth to the thrill-seeking lifestyle that resulted in the accident.In his quest to let family and friends know they need to say their final farewells to wife Elizabeth, Matt discovers information that causes a seismic shift in his view of his dying wife and of the real estate deal he has been working on for months.In this portion of the film special notice goes to Beau Bridges as Cousin Hugh who represents the ""you're not going to let down the WHOLE FAMILY are you, Matt?"" side of the King clan, and Nick Krause as Alex's friend Sid, who shows that in Hawai'i, where type A personalities are as hard to find as a snowstorm, you can't always judge a person's intelligence by their appearance or demeanor. Sid looks like any of the Beach Bums on the North Shore, but in a few telling scenes he offers Matt invaluable insight.Clooney well-deserves his Oscar nomination for his performance. Matt was never a man of action, and in this film there are a few moments where he specifically chooses NOT to act. In the audience we can see his pain, and we know there are times that a lesser, more vindictive person would have escalated the proceedings with a ""Springer-Style"" knock-down drag-out.

1429181,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B004UXUX4Q,Mark Turner,"[4, 6]","There are movies that are released and then discussed later when Oscar time rolls around as being the next best thing since sliced bread. The actors and directors are talked about and make the talk show route. Almost always these incidents are nothing more than hype, trying to drum up interest in a film that is nominated but nowhere near as good as they claim. Then there are the rare times when it all clicks and turns out to be true as with THE DESCENDANTS.George Clooney stars as Matt King, a hard working property lawyer whose made his mark while living in Hawaii. As the film opens Matt has had a major setback arrive in a speed boating accident involving his wife Elizabeth. As she lays in a coma while the doctors wait to see how she responds to treatment, Matt is faced with day to day life at home involving his youngest daughter Scottie (Amara Miller).This is not Matt's area of expertise. It soon becomes apparent that home life has little to do with Matt of late and that he has no idea how to be involved in his child's life. Scottie has been acting up at school, presumably dealing with the life threatening situation her mother is in. With no idea how to cope with Scottie, Matt flies the two of them to another island where his older daughter Alexandra (Shallene Woodley) is enrolled in boarding school with the hopes she will help him.But Alexandra doesn't offer all the help Matt needs. Following in her rambunctious mother's footsteps, Alexandra has shown a drug problem in the past and when Matt arrives he finds her drunk. Flying home the next day they talk about what is going on and why she fought with her mother the last time the two spoke. It is then that Alexandra drops the bomb in Matt's lap that spurs on the rest of the film. She lets him know that her mother was having an affair and that she had planned to divorce Matt. This scene displays the acting ability of Clooney perhaps more than any other in his career as he displays shock, outrage, pain and disbelief within a matter of seconds. In addition Matt is told there is nothing more to be done and that due to her living will his wife is soon to be taken off life support.So begins Matt's quest, aided by his daughters and Alexandra's friend Sid (Nick Krause) to find the man his wife was involved with. It turns out the man is a realtor and in witnessing one of his signs in a yard, Matt and Alexandra are able to find him on another island. Soon the four are flying once more to find this man.With little solid clues they trace him to a hotel only to find he's not there. It is by chance that Matt passes him on the beach one morning while jogging and follows him home to a cottage where he sees him with a wife and two children. Having told himself over and over again that he wants to offer this man the chance to say goodbye to Elizabeth, reality isn't quite what he expected. What does he do now?While all of this is going on a side story has Matt trying to decide what to do with a huge acreage of land that his family owns. As trustee for the land, it is up to Matt what they finally do. One group of cousins wants to sell to a high finance man from Chicago who intends to develop the land with hotels and golf courses. The other is a local man who wants to do the same but continue to involve local people. And then there is the minority who feel that the land should remain as it is in pristine condition. In seven years the trust falls apart. If they sell now each cousin and Matt have the chance at making millions.At the heart of the film are two quests involving Matt. One involves his discovering the family that he left behind for the office, getting back in touch with his children and rediscovering who they really are as well as who he is. The second is relating to the land he was put in care of, a land and history that goes well beyond years and property rights and involved a tradition and sense of community. Where Matt will go with either quest isn't seen until the final reel.Clooney is amazing here. Rather than go for an over the top performance he displays so many subtle signs of emotion that you can feel each and every thing that goes through the character's mind as the story unfolds. His frustration, his rage, his sadness are all on display through the performance Clooney offers and it stands out as one of his best. Equally amazing is his supporting cast, most notably Woodley and Miller who show a large emotional depth for their young years.This film isn't a feel good movie but at the same time it isn't a downer either. It offers true moment of humor as well as drama and tells a story that involves you from beginning to end. As I watched I wondered if this was a movie I would watch again or just place on the shelf. In the end I decided it has to be seen more than once with time spent between viewings the better to appreciate what is seen on screen. This is one movie you don't want to miss.",5,BELIEVE THE HYPE,1332201600,"03 20, 2012",2012,4927,"['are', 'movies', 'are', 'released', 'then', 'discussed', 'later', 'when', 'Oscar', 'time', 'rolls', 'around', 'being', 'next', 'best', 'thing', 'sliced', 'bread', 'actors', 'directors', 'are', 'talked', 'make', 'talk', 'show', 'route', 'Almost', 'always', 'incidents', 'are', 'nothing', 'more', 'hype', 'trying', 'drum', 'up', 'interest', 'film', 'nominated', 'nowhere', 'as', 'good', 'claim', 'Then', 'are', 'rare', 'times', 'when', 'clicks', 'out', 'be', 'true', 'THE', 'DESCENDANTS.George', 'Clooney', 'Matt', 'King', 'hard', 'working', 'property', 'lawyer', 'made', 'mark', 'living', 'Hawaii', 'film', 'Matt', 'had', 'major', 'setback', 'arrive', 'speed', 'boating', 'accident', 'involving', 'wife', 'Elizabeth', 'coma', 'doctors', 'wait', 'see', 'how', 'treatment', 'Matt', 'faced', 'day', 'day', 'life', 'home', 'involving', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'Scottie', 'Amara', 'Miller', '.This', 'not', 'Matt', 'area', 'expertise', 'soon', 'apparent', 'home', 'life', 'little', 'do', 'Matt', 'late', 'idea', 'how', 'be', 'involved', 'child', 'life', 'Scottie', 'been', 'acting', 'up', 'school', 'presumably', 'dealing', 'life', 'threatening', 'situation', 'mother', 'idea', 'how', 'cope', 'Scottie', 'Matt', 'two', 'island', 'where', 'older', 'daughter', 'Alexandra', 'Shallene', 'Woodley', 'enrolled', 'boarding', 'school', 'hopes', 'will', 'help', 'him.But', 'Alexandra', ""n't"", 'offer', 'help', 'Matt', 'Following', 'rambunctious', 'mother', 'footsteps', 'Alexandra', 'shown', 'drug', 'problem', 'past', 'when', 'Matt', 'drunk', 'Flying', 'home', 'next', 'day', 'talk', 'what', 'going', 'why', 'fought', 'mother', 'last', 'time', 'two', 'spoke', 'then', 'Alexandra', 'bomb', 'Matt', 'lap', 'rest', 'film', 'know', 'mother', 'was', 'having', 'affair', 'had', 'planned', 'divorce', 'Matt', 'scene', 'acting', 'ability', 'Clooney', 'perhaps', 'more', 'other', 'career', 'shock', 'outrage', 'pain', 'disbelief', 'matter', 'seconds', 'addition', 'Matt', 'told', 'nothing', 'more', 'be', 'done', 'due', 'living', 'will', 'wife', 'soon', 'be', 'taken', 'off', 'life', 'support.So', 'Matt', 'quest', 'aided', 'daughters', 'Alexandra', 'friend', 'Sid', 'Nick', 'Krause', 'find', 'man', 'wife', 'was', 'involved', 'out', 'man', 'realtor', 'witnessing', 'one', 'signs', 'yard', 'Matt', 'Alexandra', 'are', 'able', 'find', 'island', 'four', 'are', 'flying', 'once', 'more', 'find', 'man.With', 'little', 'solid', 'clues', 'trace', 'hotel', 'only', 'find', 'not', 'there', 'chance', 'Matt', 'beach', 'one', 'morning', 'jogging', 'home', 'cottage', 'where', 'wife', 'two', 'children', 'Having', 'told', 'over', 'again', 'offer', 'man', 'chance', 'say', 'goodbye', 'Elizabeth', 'reality', ""n't"", 'quite', 'what', 'expected', 'What', 'do', 'now', 'going', 'side', 'story', 'Matt', 'trying', 'decide', 'what', 'do', 'huge', 'acreage', 'land', 'family', 'trustee', 'land', 'Matt', 'what', 'finally', 'do', 'One', 'group', 'cousins', 'sell', 'high', 'finance', 'man', 'Chicago', 'who', 'develop', 'land', 'hotels', 'golf', 'courses', 'other', 'local', 'man', 'who', 'do', 'same', 'continue', 'involve', 'local', 'people', 'then', 'minority', 'who', 'feel', 'land', 'should', 'remain', 'pristine', 'condition', 'seven', 'years', 'trust', 'apart', 'sell', 'now', 'cousin', 'Matt', 'have', 'chance', 'making', 'heart', 'film', 'are', 'two', 'quests', 'involving', 'Matt', 'One', 'discovering', 'family', 'left', 'behind', 'office', 'getting', 'back', 'touch', 'children', 'rediscovering', 'who', 'really', 'are', 'as', 'well', 'who', 'second', 'relating', 'land', 'was', 'put', 'care', 'land', 'history', 'well', 'years', 'property', 'rights', 'involved', 'tradition', 'sense', 'community', 'Where', 'Matt', 'will', 'go', 'quest', ""n't"", 'seen', 'final', 'reel.Clooney', 'amazing', 'here', 'Rather', 'go', 'top', 'performance', 'so', 'many', 'subtle', 'signs', 'emotion', 'can', 'feel', 'thing', 'character', 'mind', 'story', 'unfolds', 'frustration', 'rage', 'sadness', 'are', 'display', 'performance', 'Clooney', 'offers', 'out', 'one', 'best', 'Equally', 'amazing', 'supporting', 'cast', 'most', 'notably', 'Woodley', 'Miller', 'who', 'show', 'large', 'emotional', 'depth', 'young', 'years.This', 'film', ""n't"", 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'same', 'time', ""n't"", 'downer', 'either', 'true', 'moment', 'humor', 'as', 'well', 'drama', 'story', 'beginning', 'end', 'watched', 'wondered', 'was', 'movie', 'would', 'watch', 'again', 'just', 'place', 'shelf', 'end', 'decided', 'be', 'seen', 'more', 'once', 'time', 'spent', 'viewings', 'better', 'appreciate', 'what', 'seen', 'screen', 'one', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss']",The Descendants

Because he's always been kind of a hands-off dad, Matt is unsure of how to relate to his two daughters, 10-year old pretentious Scottie (Amara Miller) and 17-year-old troublemaker Alexandra (Shailene Woodley). He's also thrown for a loop when his eldest daughter reveals that his wife had been having an affair before her accident. Matt has to cope with the cold hard facts about his marriage, coupled with his wife's grave condition and the toll this is taking on his family. In addition, Matt's family is pressuring him to sell a large sum of land that their ancestors passed down to them, which is located along the beautiful Hawaaiian coastline. The debate over the land has unexpected connections to Matt's personal situation, and the poor guy has to somehow figure everything out on his own.I'm not sure if Matt King is George Clooney's best role, but it;s definitely one of them. He delivers a moving performance as a man who is completely broken, yet forcing himself to keep it together for the sake of his two kids. I was also very pleased with Woodley's performance as Matt's teenage daughter. Hers is a very complex role, and the young actress tackles it with grace and honesty. The film itself is incredibly well-done, though extremely depressing.

Now I've found myself going back to see it several tines, I''m not entirely sure why. Because I miss Hawaii? For the music?Some poor reviews here seem to be due to having been promised a comedy. I wasn't promised a comedy and it wasn't a comedy. Neither was it 'sad'. A commenter complains that Clooney is not accurately cast as a father figure. But he is exactly cast as a father and husband who has been putting all of his attention on business, flying to different islands as a lawyer, and barely knowing his children. By the end he and his children have been through a real and painful life's adventure with each other and settle into a connective balance together which shows each one has changed and grown.The story, of a man sleuthing out the man with whom he learns his wife has been having an affair is one we haven't seen before. He does it with the help of his 16-year old daughter, the one who knew her mother had been having an affair and had written her off because of it. The father and daughter flying to another island to find and maybe confront the adulterous man while the mother is in a coma is new and raw. Yet, all of it unfolds satisfyingly and evenly, with no melodrama orr sentiment or more or less than real feelings.The one brief scene which marred the reality that had been set was when Clooney goes at night to spy on the man and pops his head up and down behind a hedge.

1429199,A1AFXJ8U72MD6L,B004UXUX4Q,"MISTER SJEM ""sonofhotpie""","[2, 3]","This ""dramedy"" (a comedy with dramatic moments) was well received by the critics, attaining  an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, as well as two Golden Globe Awards for Best Picture - Drama and Best Actor - Drama for George Clooney (the main character of this picture). It won a number of lesser known awards so I'm not kidding when I tell you the critics loved it.So what's it about? Focus on Hawaii and a guy named Matt (Clooney) who runs a steady real estate law practice and is also the executor for a huge chunk of land worth millions to developers. It has been in the family for generations (hence the title) and most of Matt's relatives want to sell the land and make millions. Matt is going along with it but part of him wonders if they're doing a disservice to later generations in the family.But the real catalyst is when Matt's wife has a major boating accident and is in the hospital with a coma and Matt believes she is going to come out of it and then the doctor tells him it isn't going to happen and he needs to tell the whole family that she will be dead soon. That's when the poignant moments come into this movie which are most likely the major reason it was so well received by the critics. Add to that a dysfunctional family with secrets and you start to see everything unravel but you also get these strange moments where you can't help laughing or maybe laughing but still feeling their pain. At one point Matt tells his eldest daughter that their mother isn't going to make it (he does it clumsily at best) and the daughter submerges into the pool holding her breathe and the camera spends an inordinate amount of time focused on her facial grief. She comes up out of the pool and starts to walk away from her father not wanting to share her pain with a family member you would think she would want to do so with but that just reinforces the dysfunctional actions of this family.Minor spoiler coming up so stop reading if you want to go in totally blind and already know you will see this picture. Matt's eldest daughter, who is at that difficult teenager/young adult transition, tells him that his wife was cheating on him with some real estate agent (she doesn't known his name or location). As to be expected this sends Matt into an emotional meltdown and you get to see him in this undignified moment in which he's running in his boat shoes down a road to confront the best friend of his wife to find out who the cheater is and where he lives. What follows is a journey with his two daughters and a guy friend of the eldest named Sid to confront the real estate man but to also come to terms with their grief, unsaid words to the mother/wife in a coma and their overall place in the universe. This is a definite soul searching movie on several levels. People who watch this casually and don't appreciate the poignant moments will wonder what all the fuss was about.Sid is arguably and surprisingly the closest echo character to Matt. There are a few moments of clarity in which they have these revealing conversations. That said, he's kind of an insensitive jerk at times so I enjoyed it when he got face punched by Matt's father-in-law. The eldest daughter lashes out in her rage at times, especially towards what her mother has done to the family, and the youngest daughter knows something is wrong so she goes off into dramatic situations to get attention.Themes about forgiveness versus vengeance when your spouse cheats on you are obvious. What type of person would you be and the film suggests you really do not know until it happens. Additionally, there's a definite thematic focus on how weird family can sometimes get with large sums of money as well as how a family can still be a family even though it's noticeably dysfunction (if the psychological stats are correct well over half of American families are dysfunctional).Based on a novel of the same name by  Kaui Hart Hemmings. The budget for this film was $20M and it made a bit over $82M at the Box Office. Clooney's performance, subtle at times, pumps up the quality of this picture.STORY/PLOTTING: B plus to A minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus to A minus; CINEMATOGRAPHY: B plus to A minus; SCENERY: B plus; THEMES/FOCUSES: A minus; WHEN WATCHED: mid June 2012; OVERALL GRADE: B plus to A minus.",5,MY GRADE: B plus to A minus.,1339804800,"06 16, 2012",2012,4300,"['dramedy', 'comedy', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'was', 'well', 'received', 'critics', 'attaining', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Adapted', 'Screenplay', 'as', 'well', 'two', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Awards', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Drama', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Drama', 'George', 'Clooney', 'main', 'character', 'picture', 'won', 'number', 'lesser', 'known', 'awards', ""'m"", 'not', 'kidding', 'when', 'tell', 'critics', 'loved', 'it.So', 'what', 'Focus', 'Hawaii', 'guy', 'named', 'Matt', 'Clooney', 'who', 'steady', 'real', 'estate', 'law', 'practice', 'also', 'executor', 'huge', 'chunk', 'land', 'worth', 'millions', 'developers', 'been', 'family', 'generations', 'hence', 'title', 'most', 'Matt', 'relatives', 'want', 'sell', 'land', 'make', 'millions', 'Matt', 'going', 'part', 'wonders', ""'re"", 'doing', 'disservice', 'later', 'generations', 'family.But', 'real', 'catalyst', 'when', 'Matt', 'wife', 'major', 'boating', 'accident', 'hospital', 'coma', 'Matt', 'going', 'come', 'then', 'doctor', ""n't"", 'going', 'happen', 'tell', 'whole', 'family', 'will', 'be', 'dead', 'soon', 'when', 'poignant', 'come', 'movie', 'are', 'most', 'likely', 'major', 'reason', 'was', 'so', 'well', 'received', 'critics', 'Add', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'secrets', 'start', 'see', 'everything', 'unravel', 'also', 'get', 'strange', 'moments', 'where', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'laughing', 'maybe', 'laughing', 'still', 'feeling', 'pain', 'one', 'point', 'Matt', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'mother', ""n't"", 'going', 'make', 'clumsily', 'best', 'daughter', 'pool', 'holding', 'breathe', 'camera', 'inordinate', 'amount', 'time', 'focused', 'facial', 'grief', 'up', 'pool', 'walk', 'away', 'father', 'not', 'wanting', 'share', 'pain', 'family', 'member', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'want', 'do', 'so', 'just', 'dysfunctional', 'actions', 'family.Minor', 'spoiler', 'coming', 'up', 'so', 'stop', 'reading', 'want', 'go', 'totally', 'blind', 'already', 'know', 'will', 'see', 'picture', 'Matt', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'who', 'difficult', 'teenager/young', 'adult', 'transition', 'wife', 'was', 'cheating', 'real', 'estate', 'agent', ""n't"", 'known', 'name', 'location', 'be', 'expected', 'Matt', 'emotional', 'meltdown', 'get', 'see', 'undignified', 'moment', 'running', 'boat', 'shoes', 'down', 'road', 'confront', 'best', 'friend', 'wife', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'cheater', 'where', 'What', 'journey', 'two', 'daughters', 'guy', 'friend', 'eldest', 'named', 'Sid', 'confront', 'real', 'estate', 'man', 'also', 'come', 'terms', 'grief', 'unsaid', 'words', 'mother/wife', 'coma', 'overall', 'place', 'universe', 'definite', 'soul', 'searching', 'movie', 'several', 'levels', 'People', 'who', 'watch', 'casually', 'do', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'poignant', 'moments', 'will', 'wonder', 'what', 'fuss', 'was', 'about.Sid', 'arguably', 'surprisingly', 'closest', 'echo', 'character', 'Matt', 'are', 'few', 'moments', 'clarity', 'have', 'revealing', 'conversations', 'said', 'kind', 'insensitive', 'jerk', 'times', 'so', 'enjoyed', 'when', 'got', 'face', 'punched', 'Matt', 'father-in-law', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'out', 'rage', 'times', 'especially', 'what', 'mother', 'done', 'family', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'knows', 'something', 'wrong', 'so', 'off', 'dramatic', 'situations', 'get', 'attention.Themes', 'forgiveness', 'versus', 'vengeance', 'when', 'spouse', 'cheats', 'are', 'obvious', 'What', 'type', 'person', 'would', 'be', 'film', 'really', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'Additionally', 'definite', 'thematic', 'focus', 'how', 'weird', 'family', 'can', 'sometimes', 'get', 'large', 'sums', 'money', 'as', 'well', 'how', 'family', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'family', 'even', 'noticeably', 'dysfunction', 'psychological', 'stats', 'are', 'correct', 'well', 'half', 'American', 'families', 'are', 'dysfunctional', '.Based', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Kaui', 'Hart', 'Hemmings', 'budget', 'film', 'was', '20M', 'made', 'bit', '82M', 'Box', 'Office', 'Clooney', 'performance', 'subtle', 'times', 'up', 'quality', 'picture.STORY/PLOTTING', 'B', 'A', 'minus', 'CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE', 'B', 'A', 'minus', 'CINEMATOGRAPHY', 'B', 'A', 'minus', 'SCENERY', 'B', 'THEMES/FOCUSES', 'minus', 'WHEN', 'WATCHED', 'mid', 'June', '2012', 'OVERALL', 'GRADE', 'B', 'minus']",The Descendants

We begin with his wife on life support the victim of a misguided motor boat race. As the film proceeds, we find that the impetuous wife has done all sorts of things, some which will remain secret so as not to ruin the plot. We also find that his two daughters, age 10 and 17, are behaving in many self-destructive, neurotic ways, which the father must contend with even as his wife lies on the edge between life and death.The overriding theme of this gem directed by Alexander Payne is how we endure suffering. You can see the weight of the world on George Clooney's shoulders as he descends deeper and deeper into misery and while tempted into bitterness and spite,  we see a man stake claim to his humanity for the sake of himself and his children.As the father decides to be spiteful or accepting for the many betrayals he encounters, I was reminded of a Louis C.K. show where he tries to dissuade a depressed friend from committing suicide. He says, ""Your life is not your own. It belongs to your family, friends, and society at large.""I felt the Clooney character came to this realization.  All of this is done without being bombastic and preachy. Rather, the film is mostly funny and sad, a typical duality from Payne who did the same in Election and Sideways.

1429205,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B004UXUX4Q,M. Oleson,"[1, 1]","Based on the trailers, you would expect this film is mostly a comedy.  After all, it takes place in Hawaii and it stars George Clooney who we see in the trailer running with a funny gate and determined but weird look on his face.  Yes, this scene is in the movie but this isn't a comedy.  It's about a death...and life.Matt (Clooney) is a wealthy attorney but his real nest egg rests with some large acreage than he and a bevy of cousins have inherited from their families that have roots with a native Hawaiian princess.  The land is pristine and undeveloped.  Although jointly owned, Matt is the sole trustee therefore can decide on what happens with the land.  A plan is in place to sell the land to developers which would provide each of the owners a huge fortune.This really isn't the main story however, important as it is to the outcome.  Matt's wife is in a non-reversible coma and on life support after a boating accident. She will soon die.  They have 2 daughters, one 17 and another 11.  He's never been overly involved in their upbringing as this was the mother's role.  To complicate matters, Matt finds out that his wife had other outside interests besides boating.Alexander Payne (""Sideways"") doesn't make a lot of movies but they always resonate.  This one is no exception.  He and his co-writers have put together a strong drama that is never heavy-handed or depressing.  This takes a deft hand at the helm and Payne provides it along with a stellar performance by Clooney and a cast of newcomers (Shailene Woodley and Amara Miller as the daughters) and veterans (Beau Bridges, Judy Greer, Robert Forster and Matthew Lillard).Blu ray update:  I still love the story and the way director Alexander Payne manages to get great performances from virtually every person on the set.  From surfing legend Laird Hamilton to George Clooney in what must be considered the finest of his career.  One thing the Blu ray allows you to do is study the actors in a closer more personal way as they inhabit their characters.  Clooney's character Matt King runs the gamete of emotions as he tries to deal with multiple catastrophes including the loss of his wife.The other standout performance is by Shailene Woodley as Matt's oldest daughter Alex.  She goes from a wild partying 17 year old to a mature take charge older sister.  The younger sister Scottie is played by Amara Miller and frankly I didn't pay much attention to her the first time I saw the film.  I was so absorbed with everything else.  But watch this young actress steal scenes and add a bit of needed humor at the appropriate moment.Even small roles are played for all they're worth.  Robert Forster is the dickish father-in-law of Matt.  But Matt gives him an opportunity to grieve in his own way.  Watch the tender scene in the hospital as Forster's character says goodbye to his daughter.  Check out Judy Greer as the aggrieved spouse of her husband's infidelity.  The husband played by Matthew Lillard is likewise remarkable.  Far removed from Scooby-Doo. Beau Bridges has a couple brief scenes as Matt's cousin, but he takes full advantage.  Finally, you have to give it up for Patricia Hastie in an unappreciated and probably agonizing role as the comatose Elizabeth.  ""The Descendants"" is one of the finest films from 2011.The Blu ray shows a perfectly presented video in 1080p.  The colorful Hawaiian landscape shows up well with sharp focused detail.  It has a very film-like quality which is appropriate.  The aspect ratio is 2.40:1.  The audio is DTS-HD MA 5.1 and while not spectacular it is not distracting either.  This is a dialog centered film and it is clear and centered.  The guitar and ukulele plays in many scenes and they sound great.  Well done.",5,(BLU RAY REVIEW) Another brilliant film from Alexander Payne and masterful perfomance from George Clooney,1322265600,"11 26, 2011",2011,3736,"['Based', 'trailers', 'would', 'expect', 'film', 'mostly', 'comedy', 'place', 'Hawaii', 'George', 'Clooney', 'who', 'see', 'trailer', 'running', 'funny', 'gate', 'determined', 'weird', 'look', 'face', 'Yes', 'scene', 'movie', ""n't"", 'comedy', 'death', 'life.Matt', 'Clooney', 'wealthy', 'attorney', 'real', 'nest', 'egg', 'rests', 'large', 'acreage', 'bevy', 'cousins', 'have', 'inherited', 'families', 'have', 'roots', 'native', 'Hawaiian', 'princess', 'land', 'pristine', 'undeveloped', 'jointly', 'owned', 'Matt', 'sole', 'trustee', 'therefore', 'can', 'decide', 'what', 'land', 'plan', 'place', 'sell', 'land', 'developers', 'would', 'provide', 'owners', 'huge', 'fortune.This', 'really', ""n't"", 'main', 'story', 'however', 'important', 'outcome', 'Matt', 'wife', 'non-reversible', 'coma', 'life', 'support', 'boating', 'accident', 'will', 'soon', 'die', 'have', '2', 'daughters', 'one', '17', '11', 'never', 'been', 'overly', 'involved', 'upbringing', 'was', 'mother', 'role', 'complicate', 'matters', 'Matt', 'out', 'wife', 'had', 'other', 'outside', 'interests', 'boating.Alexander', 'Payne', 'Sideways', ""n't"", 'make', 'lot', 'movies', 'always', 'resonate', 'one', 'exception', 'co-writers', 'have', 'put', 'together', 'strong', 'drama', 'never', 'heavy-handed', 'depressing', 'deft', 'hand', 'helm', 'Payne', 'along', 'stellar', 'performance', 'Clooney', 'cast', 'newcomers', 'Shailene', 'Woodley', 'Amara', 'Miller', 'daughters', 'veterans', 'Beau', 'Bridges', 'Judy', 'Greer', 'Robert', 'Forster', 'Matthew', 'Lillard', '.Blu', 'ray', 'update', 'still', 'love', 'story', 'way', 'director', 'Alexander', 'Payne', 'get', 'great', 'performances', 'virtually', 'person', 'set', 'surfing', 'legend', 'Laird', 'Hamilton', 'George', 'Clooney', 'what', 'must', 'be', 'considered', 'finest', 'career', 'One', 'thing', 'Blu', 'ray', 'do', 'study', 'actors', 'closer', 'more', 'personal', 'way', 'inhabit', 'characters', 'Clooney', 'character', 'Matt', 'King', 'gamete', 'emotions', 'deal', 'multiple', 'catastrophes', 'including', 'loss', 'wife.The', 'other', 'standout', 'performance', 'Shailene', 'Woodley', 'Matt', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'Alex', 'wild', 'partying', '17', 'year', 'old', 'mature', 'take', 'charge', 'older', 'sister', 'younger', 'sister', 'Scottie', 'played', 'Amara', 'Miller', 'frankly', 'did', ""n't"", 'pay', 'much', 'attention', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'absorbed', 'everything', 'else', 'watch', 'young', 'actress', 'steal', 'scenes', 'add', 'bit', 'needed', 'humor', 'appropriate', 'moment.Even', 'small', 'roles', 'are', 'played', ""'re"", 'worth', 'Robert', 'Forster', 'dickish', 'father-in-law', 'Matt', 'Matt', 'opportunity', 'grieve', 'own', 'way', 'Watch', 'tender', 'scene', 'hospital', 'Forster', 'character', 'goodbye', 'daughter', 'Check', 'out', 'Judy', 'Greer', 'aggrieved', 'spouse', 'husband', 'infidelity', 'husband', 'played', 'Matthew', 'Lillard', 'likewise', 'remarkable', 'Far', 'removed', 'Scooby-Doo', 'Beau', 'Bridges', 'couple', 'brief', 'scenes', 'Matt', 'cousin', 'full', 'advantage', 'Finally', 'have', 'give', 'up', 'Patricia', 'Hastie', 'unappreciated', 'probably', 'agonizing', 'role', 'comatose', 'Elizabeth', 'Descendants', 'one', 'finest', 'films', '2011.The', 'Blu', 'ray', 'perfectly', 'presented', 'video', '1080p', 'colorful', 'Hawaiian', 'landscape', 'up', 'well', 'sharp', 'focused', 'detail', 'very', 'film-like', 'quality', 'appropriate', 'aspect', 'ratio', '2.40:1', 'audio', 'DTS-HD', 'MA', '5.1', 'not', 'spectacular', 'not', 'distracting', 'either', 'dialog', 'centered', 'film', 'clear', 'centered', 'guitar', 'ukulele', 'plays', 'many', 'scenes', 'sound', 'great', 'Well', 'done']",The Descendants

There's no plot, it did get a little interesting when the protagonist finds out that his wife cheated on him, but Clooney doesn't do anything with that information, I mean emotionally down deep where the soul lies. Nothing. He goes and finds the guy that the wife had an affair with to give him an opportunity to say goodbye to her since she's about to die. How about punching him or ruining his life or something...it's just ""F U and you better have a better attitude towards me"" are Clooney's character's words to the cheater. Also why was Clooney's character a bad father because he worked a lot, because he provided a really nice home for his family, because he didn't have enough time for the kids. Frankly Clooney's character seems like he has all the time in the world in this movie. Also as a father he seems very approachable. I didn't see any change in the protagonist from the beginning to the end. Same note, flat. This could have been an interesting story if the wife woke up from the coma, but the way it's written it's so nice and neat. Beau Bridges was wonderful, his part should have been bigger and the teenage daughter was good. I was left questioning whether clooney's character didn't sell the land because he didn't want the cheater to get the commission instead of the sanctimonious reason that clooney's character gives. How about some truth, the real side of human nature unless I missed something and George Clooney is now a saint. There is no inner conflict at all that Clooney's character exhibits.I have noticed in some of the other reviews that subtlety is the new boring, i.e. if you find a movie boring, it wasn't really boring it was subtle.

Despite their mother's injury the children like any youths are experiencing a confusing stage in their lives and Matt is forced to find caring and leadership skills, which he for years has avoided. Matt already has his hands full as the sole trustee of a family trust, which has ownership of 25,000 pristine acres of land on the island of Kaua'i, and also his normal job as a lawyer.The narrative is very much focused on a collective path of discovery and transition for Matt King and his daughters, which is at times tragic, humorous, and satisfying for the viewer. Matt's ultimate decision regarding the family trust is influenced by his grief experience, but more so by the clarity he receives after assessing his life.George Clooney provides a solid performance as Matt King with a convincing screen presence, and the entire cast present as unique and interesting characters.Nicholas R.W.

No sir, he doesn't let you off that easy. If you've seen the trailer for The Descendants, you basically understand most of the plot twists because Payne lays his cards on the table early on. George Clooney's estranged wife falls into a deathly coma. Clooney enlists the courage of his troubled daughters in order to reengage decayed family dynamics only to learn that his wife was committing adultery. There, I've said it. Plot ruined.Actually, that's where the movie begins. Payne isn't interested so much in abruptness as he is with painful realization and its curious road to resolution. As evidence, up and coming teenage actress Shailene Woodley provides a heart-wrenching performance drenched with anger from the bottom of Clooney's leaf contaminated pool. Using the alluring Hawaiian paradise to contrast his story of grief and brokenness, Clooney is burdened with the responsibility of not biting from Eden's apple, however personal and complicated its abstinence proves. Payne absorbs the screen using supporting characters quilted with composite personalities in order to deliver the complexity in the protagonist's ultimate decision for doing good.Films by Alexander Payne:The Descendants, 2011Sideways, 2004About Schmidt, 2002Election, 1999",5,A descendant of great filmmaking.,1327881600,"01 30, 2012",2012,1494,"['give', 'children', 'enough', 'money', 'do', 'something', 'not', 'enough', 'do', 'nothing', 'Matt', 'King', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Director', 'screenwriter', 'Alexander', 'Payne', ""n't"", 'wait', 'end', 'films', 'pellet', 'plate', 'trembling', 'reality', 'shifts', 'sir', ""n't"", 'let', 'off', 'easy', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'trailer', 'Descendants', 'basically', 'understand', 'most', 'plot', 'twists', 'Payne', 'cards', 'table', 'early', 'George', 'Clooney', 'estranged', 'wife', 'deathly', 'coma', 'Clooney', 'courage', 'troubled', 'daughters', 'order', 'reengage', 'decayed', 'family', 'dynamics', 'only', 'learn', 'wife', 'was', 'committing', 'adultery', ""'ve"", 'said', 'Plot', 'ruined.Actually', 'where', 'movie', 'Payne', ""n't"", 'interested', 'so', 'much', 'abruptness', 'painful', 'realization', 'curious', 'road', 'resolution', 'evidence', 'up', 'coming', 'teenage', 'actress', 'Shailene', 'Woodley', 'heart-wrenching', 'performance', 'drenched', 'anger', 'bottom', 'Clooney', 'leaf', 'contaminated', 'pool', 'Using', 'alluring', 'Hawaiian', 'paradise', 'contrast', 'story', 'grief', 'brokenness', 'Clooney', 'burdened', 'responsibility', 'not', 'biting', 'Eden', 'apple', 'however', 'personal', 'complicated', 'abstinence', 'proves', 'Payne', 'screen', 'using', 'supporting', 'characters', 'quilted', 'composite', 'personalities', 'order', 'deliver', 'complexity', 'protagonist', 'ultimate', 'decision', 'doing', 'good.Films', 'Alexander', 'Payne', 'Descendants', '2011Sideways', '2004About', 'Schmidt', '2002Election', '1999']",The Descendants
1429218,A292163FE9C117,B004UXUX4Q,"Norma Beishir ""author, The Unicorn's Daughter""","[1, 5]","George Clooney is more than just a pretty face.Just in case you didn't already know that, see The Descendants. In my opinion, this is the best film he's made to date. Clooney is a movie star who can still morph into a character, unlike some movie stars who come across on screen as movie stars just playing someone else (Tom Cruise, I'm talking about you). In this film, he's a lawyer named Matt King whose risk-taking wife is on life support, having been critically injured in a water skiing accident. He's also dealing with two daughters, both having trouble coping with their mother's absence.Then he finds out his wife had been having an affair and was planning to leave him. As he searches for answers, he struggles to hold his family together, spearhead the sale of his family's ancestral land, and eventually make a decision as to whether or not to keep his wife on life support. When he sets out to find and confront the real estate broker his wife was seeing, with his daughters and eldest daughter Alex's dopey friend Sid in two, the family begins to bond.Clooney, a confirmed bachelor in real life, is spot-on as a husband and father here. As his daughters, Alex and Scottie, Shailene Woodley and Amara Miller are also wonderful. I especially liked Nick Krause as Alex's always inappropriate friend Sid. This guy was a genius when it came to ticking people off. Beau Bridges is good, as always, as one of Matt's cousins, Hugh, a long-haired, Hawaiian-shirted land baron.But the real star of this movie is Hawaii, and never has it looked more beautiful. The cinematography shows off the lush paradise to the max, providing such a stunning backdrop for the family's turmoil that you'll run, not walk, to your nearest travel agent.I confess: I've been a fan of George Clooney's ever since he played Sela Ward's love interest in the late '80s TV series Sisters...but this actor isn't getting older, he's getting better.

In the past, Payne so worked over his cliches that they were no longer cliches; he mined their essential reality and revealed them to us in ways that seemed new.

1429231,A3KM9UA6MAVURN,B004UXUX4Q,"pjf ""pjf""","[1, 1]","I saw the movie awhile back, was unimpressed, then got the book for a couple dollars in a KDD and read it. It's rare when a movie is better than a book, but this one is. Mainly because at least we have some decent scenery and Hawaiian music, and the book is oddly bereft of the ability to give any sense of Hawaii.  Also George Clooney is not bad.But the rest of movie is essentially a people drama, and the people suck.  And that's my complaint.  Who ARE these people?  Not just the woman herself, who has so much but couldn't be a decent wife and mother to her family, and take joy in what she had. Apparently, the wife whined about not having thrills and shopping sprees.  So being dissatisfied, does she do the adult thing? Talk to her husband, try to work it out, get a divorce if all else fails? No, she has an affair, and worse, one she schemes to set herself up monetarily with her lover, once her clueless husband dumps a big deal in his lap. Then she'll divorce huppy to spend the $$.  Alas, she's still thrill seeking, the deal undone, with one daughter is in a residential boarding school for drug use and the other with issues, when she gets herself in a fatal coma.The dad meanwhile, doesn't believe in living off trust funds.  That's why they'd been living on his income as a  lawyer.  Punahoe not being exactly a cheap school, with two tuitions as well the price of that house -- he worked a lot. This causes everyone, wife, kids, friends, to resent him because he works, when the rest of them seem to lay around and complain.  So I don't really see what the problem was with Clooney. I mean, the wife didn't work. She had a great life with what she had. What the heck did she have to complain about?Meanwhile the friends are dumping on Clooney, because that his wife was a lying cheat wasn't HER fault, because he was boring, busy working. With her having all those long days free, what else did she have to do but look for excitement?  Like I said, who ARE these people?  His wife's father too -- that his daughter is in a coma is not her fault for being stupid and reckless -- no, Clooney should have bought her more toys and boats and let her shop and she would have been satisfied spending his money, rather than seeking other thrills.Anyway, the plot revolves around their tying up the issues with the comatose wife, her relationships, the screwed up, entitled kids, and the husband, who seems like a decent straight up sort of guy with no flaws other than the fact that he spends his days working for a living, which is apparently too uncool to justify other human beings treat him with decency, not his kids, his wife, her parents, or his friends.There are some redeeming parts to the movie. The older girl does seem to grow up a bit. The husband gets more involved with his kids. It's nice to see Hawaii on film, and hear a little HAwaiian music.

1429232,A1GN8UJIZLCA59,B004UXUX4Q,P Magnum,"[0, 2]","The Descendants is Alexander Payne's first movie since Sideways in 2004.  Much like its predecessor, The Descendants deftly mixes pain and humor with snappy script that won Mr. Payne, Nat Faxon and Jim Rash a best adapted screenplay Oscar.  George Clooney stars as Matt King who is a real estate lawyer in Honolulu and a direct descendant of Hawaiian royalty.  He is the trustee of a family trust that owns 25,000 acres of pristine land on the island of Kauai that his family is looking to sell before the trust expires.  While this is happening, his wife Elizabeth (Patricia Hastie) is left in a coma after a boating accident.  He refers to himself as the back-up parent to his two daughters, Scottie (Amara Miller) and Alex (Shailene Woodley).  He now has to step up as a full-time father. After taking Alex home from her private school, she tells him that Elizabeth was having an affair.  This sends Matt's world spiraling even more out of control.  The rest of film deals with Matt trying to find his wife's lover and the selling of the land.  Mr. Clooney shows his versatility as an actor playing Matt as a beaten down man trying to rise to the occasion.  He received a well deserved best actor nomination.  Ms. Woodley is a real find.

But George Clooney's powerful performance takes this movie to a level it would not have achieved w/out him, It is his best film role ever...my opinion of course...and his Golden Globe award and Oscar nomination were well deserved. Clooney is Matt King, a Hawaiian attorney and sole trustee of a family trust that includes some 25K acres of prime Hawaiian land. He is trying to reconnect with his two daughters after his wife is involved in a tragic boating accident. She is not killed in the accident; in fact she is in a coma for most of the film....which is important to the plotline. He learns through his oldest daughter, Alex, that his wife, Elizabeth, was having an affair before her accident. He is also under pressure from the rest of the family to sell the land before the trust expires. So, Matt has a lot on his plate...a multitude of problems that would overwhelm most men. Not only does Clooney do a masterful job in portraying Matt, the young actress, Shailene Woodley, is perfectly cast as the 17 year old Alex.  The support cast is also superb. The score consists of Hawaiian music by different artists and perfectly sets the mood; and Alexander Payne masterfully puts it all together behind the camera.",5,"""What is it that makes the women in my life destroy themselves?""",1360281600,"02 8, 2013",2013,1348,"['great', 'film', 'definitely', 'one', 'ten', 'best', '2011', 'would', 'want', 'see', 'regardless', 'who', 'was', 'lead', 'role', 'George', 'Clooney', 'powerful', 'performance', 'movie', 'level', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'achieved', 'best', 'film', 'role', 'ever', 'opinion', 'course', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'award', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'were', 'well', 'deserved', 'Clooney', 'Matt', 'King', 'Hawaiian', 'attorney', 'sole', 'trustee', 'family', 'trust', '25K', 'acres', 'prime', 'Hawaiian', 'land', 'trying', 'reconnect', 'two', 'daughters', 'wife', 'involved', 'tragic', 'boating', 'accident', 'not', 'killed', 'accident', 'fact', 'coma', 'most', 'film', '.which', 'important', 'plotline', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'Alex', 'wife', 'Elizabeth', 'was', 'having', 'affair', 'accident', 'also', 'pressure', 'rest', 'family', 'sell', 'land', 'trust', 'So', 'Matt', 'lot', 'plate', 'multitude', 'problems', 'would', 'overwhelm', 'most', 'men', 'Not', 'only', 'Clooney', 'do', 'masterful', 'job', 'portraying', 'Matt', 'young', 'actress', 'Shailene', 'Woodley', 'perfectly', 'cast', '17', 'year', 'old', 'Alex', 'support', 'cast', 'also', 'superb', 'score', 'Hawaiian', 'music', 'different', 'artists', 'perfectly', 'mood', 'Alexander', 'Payne', 'masterfully', 'together', 'camera']",The Descendants

I liked lots about it, but I also disliked lots about it.Actually, I'm not sure if ""lots"" is the right word either. This is one maddening film.First off, I am more then familiar than Alex Payne. After all he did do my favourite movie of 2005, Sideways. However I absolutely hated About Schmidt. I thought it was boring tripe, but I decided to put that aside and watch it on the strength of Sideways alone. And boy, was I dead wrong.The film follows a real estate agent in Hawaii, Matt King, whose wife has ended up in a bad accident that has thrust her into a near death state. With the tragedy affecting his already broken family, he reunites with his bitchy teenage daughter, who spends the movie with some douchebag I couldn't for the life of me care about. She reveals that his wife had an affair with a rival agent of his, which leads him to seek him out to confront him face to face, and seal the deal on a piece of land he owns.First off, I liked Clooney. He was the film, and without him I would have been bored outright. He's the one thing keeping it watchable. Oh, and it was shot beautifully too.But... The film just bored me.First off, it's SO PREDICTABLE. I predicted the whole thing with the land and how Matt would decide he wanted to keep the land instead of selling it. I predicted how he'd fall for Speer's wife. I predicted that Speer had a wife and kids too. Seriously, how did you not see it coming?The characters were boring as hell. The only memorable one was Beau Bridges and he was only in the film for 6 minutes. Speer was so clich&eacute;d in terms of development.Oh, and worst of all- it was so full of clich&eacute;s. You can tell how it's going to end from the opening scene, and you can essentially think to yourself ""I think this is going to happen"" and -gasp- it does!But, it is prettily shot. I guess that's all that's needed to constitute Oscar bait nowadays. This isn't a bad film but it has every right to be, and the fact that it is up against The Artist for best picture is just laughable, because The Artist really does deserve the award.

That, to me, says it exactly.  If I had seen ""The Descendants"" on TV as a ""movie-of-the-week"" I would have recommended it on that simple level, but as a feature film with pretenses of garnering an Oscar, it definitely falls far short of the mark.  (But, if it wins, it certainly won't be the first one to unjustly win the statuette -- anyone remember ""Terms of Endearment"" which I continue to call ""Tears of Endurement""?)Clooney IS great as he always is but because of the film's shallowness his big crying scene had me thinking the whole time, ""this scene was contrived solely to be an Oscar scene"", as was much of the movie.

I love the shots of the valleys and beaches.  I live here so this is something I see every day.  George Clooney stars as Matt King.  He is a father trying to raise his daughters after his wife goes into a coma after a boating accident.Matt learns from his teenage daughter that his wife was carrying on an affair at the time of her accident.  The daughter is played Shailene Woodley.  Upon learning about his wife's infidelity, Matt chooses to locate and confront the man having an affair with his wife.  An actor named Matthew Lillard plays Brian Speer.  He is  the man having an  affair with Matt King's wife.  An actress named Judy Greer plays Speer's wife.  These characters each have individual scenes with Clooney that are both dramatic and comedic.I have an empathy for any father facing the issues of dating and alcoholism with his daughter.  Their relationship is authentic.  The chemistry between Clooney and Woodley is the most appealing aspects of this movie.  I have an empathy for any father and daughter facing these typical teenage issues.The music is note worthy here.  The soundtrack is filled with Hawaiian music that is playing in the background.  I don't understand a word of the Hawaiian language, but the slack key music is so peaceful and soothing.  The music reflects what living in Hawaii is like.  It is laid back and peaceful.

Thornhill,"[3, 6]","I loved Sideways, thought it was one of the best movies in recent years, was even more amazed when I read the novel and found it was crude and dumb, and had been transmuted into something deep and true by Alexander Payne. So I was hopeful when I streamed this. But it ain't the same. A promising story is somehow manacled rather than liberated. There are several problems. First, Payne labors mightily to try to make the story be about Hawaii. But it isn't. Sideways was about wine and the wine country, because the two most important characters (played by Paul Giamatti and Virginia Madsen) had the love and lore of wine in their DNA, found each other through wine -- the Giamatti character was even symbolized by Pinot Noir. Wine is more than a character in the movie: it's the very language of the movie. It's also a litmus test of every character, and the wine country as mission (for Giamatti) and escape (for Haden Church) exposes their souls. But this time you could pull the main story out of Hawaii and it would be the same. It's about how a physical accident can expose the fault lines in a family - anywhere. The endless travelogue scenery is poured over the story like a bad Hollandaise over an underdone egg. Then there's Clooney. For my money this guy has elevated ""bad casting"" to a career path. What I mean is, even when he gives a fairly good performance he is always miscast, because there's something about him that defies our ""willing suspension of disbelief"". I mean, you can just never really think he's going through the events depicted. In Sideways I never thought for a moment I was seeing any acting. With Clooney you always think, ""Oh, George is pretending to be _____."" In most of his roles he has consistently looked like a man who knows he's on camera and feels smug about it. In this film he almost slips out of both those nooses, but there's just something about that face - especially the mouth - that makes us unable to take him seriously. Maybe it's vulnerability that doesn't work... think of Cary Grant at his most suave, and there's still this quality of the vulnerable - this uncertainty about the outcome, will he be okay or not? Anyway it's a fair story, and Clooney does an excellent job, as do many other cast members, but like I said, he is miscast, because once again, he's in a movie.",2,Pretty but not profound,1332720000,"03 26, 2012",2012,2330,"['loved', 'Sideways', 'thought', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'recent', 'years', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'amazed', 'when', 'read', 'novel', 'found', 'was', 'crude', 'dumb', 'had', 'been', 'transmuted', 'something', 'deep', 'true', 'Alexander', 'Payne', 'So', 'was', 'hopeful', 'when', 'streamed', 'ai', ""n't"", 'same', 'promising', 'story', 'somehow', 'manacled', 'rather', 'liberated', 'are', 'several', 'problems', 'First', 'Payne', 'labors', 'mightily', 'try', 'make', 'story', 'be', 'Hawaii', ""n't"", 'Sideways', 'was', 'wine', 'wine', 'country', 'two', 'most', 'important', 'characters', 'played', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'had', 'love', 'lore', 'wine', 'DNA', 'found', 'other', 'wine', 'Giamatti', 'character', 'was', 'even', 'symbolized', 'Pinot', 'Noir', 'Wine', 'more', 'character', 'movie', 'very', 'language', 'movie', 'also', 'litmus', 'test', 'character', 'wine', 'country', 'mission', 'Giamatti', 'escape', 'Haden', 'Church', 'souls', 'time', 'could', 'pull', 'main', 'story', 'Hawaii', 'would', 'be', 'same', 'how', 'physical', 'accident', 'can', 'expose', 'fault', 'lines', 'family', 'anywhere', 'endless', 'travelogue', 'scenery', 'poured', 'story', 'bad', 'Hollandaise', 'underdone', 'egg', 'Then', 'Clooney', 'money', 'guy', 'elevated', 'bad', 'casting', 'career', 'path', 'What', 'mean', 'even', 'when', 'fairly', 'good', 'performance', 'always', 'miscast', 'something', 'willing', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'mean', 'can', 'just', 'never', 'really', 'think', 'going', 'events', 'depicted', 'Sideways', 'never', 'thought', 'moment', 'was', 'seeing', 'acting', 'Clooney', 'always', 'think', 'Oh', 'George', 'pretending', 'be', '_____', 'most', 'roles', 'consistently', 'looked', 'man', 'who', 'camera', 'feels', 'smug', 'film', 'almost', 'nooses', 'just', 'something', 'face', 'especially', 'mouth', 'unable', 'take', 'seriously', 'Maybe', 'vulnerability', ""n't"", 'work', 'think', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'most', 'suave', 'still', 'quality', 'vulnerable', 'uncertainty', 'outcome', 'will', 'be', 'okay', 'not', 'Anyway', 'fair', 'story', 'Clooney', 'excellent', 'job', 'do', 'many', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'said', 'miscast', 'once', 'again', 'movie']",The Descendants
1429258,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B004UXUX4Q,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 2]","In the tradition of ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" and ""Ordinary People,"" ""The Descendants"" is a high-toned social drama centered around the complex dynamics of familial relationships. Like those other films, it also won wide critical praise and a boatload of award nominations the year it was released.Matt King is a wealthy, workaholic businessman living in Hawaii with his wife and two daughters, the older of whom is a rebellious teen who's recently been shipped off to boarding school on another island. As the movie opens, we learn that Matt's world has begun to crash in on him big time as his wife lies in a coma brought on by a boating accident. Matt struggles not only with the guilt of having been an emotionally distant husband but with raising two precocious and challenging children, who are deep in the throes of typical growing pains and whom he barely seems to know at this point. He also has to deal with the complications of selling some of the valuable property he inherited from his wealthy ancestors to developers who may not be as attuned as he is to the natural beauty and ecological richness of the land.With a thoughtful and insightful screenplay by Nat Faxon, Jim Rash and director Alexander Payne, based on the novel by Kaui Hart Hemmings, the movie neatly sidesteps all the potential melodrama inherent in the material. The plot constantly wanders off onto interesting and unexpected bypaths, and characters who seem as if they could become easily pigeonholed refuse to do or say what we expect them to do or say. No one is a hero or a villain; they're all just ordinary folks trying to lead decent lives, though often falling far short of that mark, as we all do. Indeed, there is an air of verisimilitude to this film that is a rare commodity in modern commercial moviemaking. At every moment, we feel as if are watching real people acting in real ways - just as if actual life were unfolding before us. In fact, there is not a single false moment to be found anywhere in the film.This is thanks, in no small measure, to George Clooney who has never given a truer or more deeply vulnerable performance than he does here, utilizing his innate good-guy persona to astonishing effect. Ditto for Shailene Woodley and Amara Miller who play his two daughters with unerring believability and conviction. Their interactions with one another are indeed a wonder to behold.With admirable restraint, director Alexander Payne is content to let the drama speak for itself. He has the decency to pull back and give the characters their space without feeling it necessary to push his points or exploit the audience's emotions. Yet, there is a lovely, hypnotic flow to the movie that draws us into both the tropical setting (how many movies set in Hawaii are about people who actually live there?) and the lives of these ordinary people who are suffering through an extraordinary - yet, at the same time, utterly universal - ordeal.A human drama that is as intimate as it is epic, ""The Descendants"" is one of the most profound and moving film-going experiences of recent years.",5,A human drama that is both intimate and epic,1336089600,"05 4, 2012",2012,3081,"['tradition', 'Kramer', 'vs.', 'Kramer', 'Ordinary', 'People', 'Descendants', 'high-toned', 'social', 'drama', 'centered', 'complex', 'dynamics', 'familial', 'relationships', 'other', 'films', 'also', 'won', 'wide', 'critical', 'praise', 'boatload', 'award', 'nominations', 'year', 'was', 'released.Matt', 'King', 'wealthy', 'workaholic', 'businessman', 'living', 'Hawaii', 'wife', 'two', 'daughters', 'older', 'whom', 'rebellious', 'teen', 'who', 'recently', 'been', 'shipped', 'boarding', 'school', 'island', 'movie', 'learn', 'Matt', 'world', 'begun', 'crash', 'big', 'time', 'wife', 'coma', 'brought', 'boating', 'accident', 'Matt', 'not', 'only', 'guilt', 'having', 'been', 'emotionally', 'distant', 'husband', 'raising', 'two', 'precocious', 'challenging', 'children', 'who', 'are', 'deep', 'throes', 'typical', 'growing', 'pains', 'whom', 'barely', 'know', 'point', 'also', 'deal', 'complications', 'selling', 'valuable', 'property', 'inherited', 'wealthy', 'ancestors', 'developers', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'attuned', 'natural', 'beauty', 'ecological', 'richness', 'land.With', 'thoughtful', 'insightful', 'screenplay', 'Nat', 'Faxon', 'Jim', 'Rash', 'director', 'Alexander', 'Payne', 'based', 'novel', 'Kaui', 'Hart', 'Hemmings', 'movie', 'neatly', 'potential', 'melodrama', 'inherent', 'material', 'plot', 'constantly', 'interesting', 'unexpected', 'bypaths', 'characters', 'who', 'seem', 'could', 'become', 'easily', 'pigeonholed', 'refuse', 'do', 'say', 'what', 'expect', 'do', 'say', 'one', 'hero', 'villain', ""'re"", 'just', 'ordinary', 'folks', 'trying', 'lead', 'decent', 'lives', 'though', 'often', 'falling', 'far', 'short', 'mark', 'do', 'Indeed', 'air', 'verisimilitude', 'film', 'rare', 'commodity', 'modern', 'commercial', 'moviemaking', 'moment', 'feel', 'are', 'watching', 'real', 'people', 'acting', 'real', 'ways', 'just', 'actual', 'life', 'were', 'unfolding', 'fact', 'not', 'single', 'false', 'moment', 'be', 'found', 'anywhere', 'film.This', 'thanks', 'small', 'measure', 'George', 'Clooney', 'who', 'never', 'given', 'truer', 'more', 'deeply', 'vulnerable', 'performance', 'here', 'utilizing', 'innate', 'good-guy', 'persona', 'astonishing', 'effect', 'Ditto', 'Shailene', 'Woodley', 'Amara', 'Miller', 'who', 'play', 'two', 'daughters', 'unerring', 'believability', 'conviction', 'interactions', 'one', 'are', 'indeed', 'wonder', 'behold.With', 'admirable', 'restraint', 'director', 'Alexander', 'Payne', 'content', 'let', 'drama', 'speak', 'decency', 'pull', 'back', 'give', 'characters', 'space', 'feeling', 'necessary', 'push', 'points', 'exploit', 'audience', 'emotions', 'Yet', 'lovely', 'hypnotic', 'flow', 'movie', 'tropical', 'setting', 'how', 'many', 'movies', 'set', 'Hawaii', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'actually', 'live', 'there', 'lives', 'ordinary', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'suffering', 'extraordinary', 'yet', 'same', 'time', 'utterly', 'universal', 'ordeal.A', 'human', 'drama', 'as', 'intimate', 'epic', 'Descendants', 'one', 'most', 'profound', 'moving', 'film-going', 'experiences', 'recent', 'years']",The Descendants

I didn't like it, but that's how parents are raising their kids to talk to them now and they're all in denial like they have these really good kids. That's one of the reasons why I was able to watch it and enjoy it because it was showing people for what they truly are.So many movies try and gloss over people's actual personalities and try and come across like the Cleavers, but most families are far far from anything like that. And so are people. Get over it and stop acting like it doesn't happen because it does.Now, as far as this movie goes, I liked it because it was different, but I loved it because of the acting and the writing. I loved it because it was shot beautifully. And I loved it because it told so many different stories in 2 hours. I just thought it was being truthful.

1429268,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B004UXUX4Q,Scott Schiefelbein,"[2, 3]","Alexander Payne knows how to make a character-driven film. In his previous movies ""Election"" and ""Sideways,"" the good guys are inherently flawed and the villains have many virtues, but people constantly get themselves into trouble by making those little decisions that have major, unforeseen consequences.""Everything just happens."" The line heard in Payne's latest film, ""The Descendants,"" neatly sums up the writer-director's philosophy. Much happens to Matt King (George Clooney) in this movie, set entirely in Hawaii, where King's life is teetering on the edge of picturesque seaside cliffs. His thrill-seeking wife lies in a coma following a powerboat accident, and her chances of recovery are slim. The couple's 10-year-old daughter, Scottie (Amara Miller), rages against the world, and King is so feckless a dad that he turns to his 17-year-old, Alex (Shailene Woodley), for help, even though he has already sent her to boarding school to wean her off alcohol, drugs and men.  The other potential source of help, King's father-in-law (Robert Forster), blames him for the accident.King's family brings another huge piece of baggage: a piece of Hawaii's soul. The King family are Haole descendants of King Kamehameha's family (Haole is Hawaiian for honkey) and King's cousins have each squandered their vast inheritances. King has preserved his share by living a comparably frugal life and, understandably, he is the sole trustee of the family's once-vast trust. The trust owns one major asset, an unspoiled 25,000-acre plot of paradise on Kauai that most of King's cousins want to sell to a developer. Such a sale would infuriate most of the state, but Cousin Hugh (Beau Bridges) makes it clear that a few hundred million soothes a wounded conscience quite nicely.To top it off (as we saw in the movie's trailer), King learns that his wife has been cheating on him. And so it is we see King's point when he observes, ""Paradise? Paradise can go . . ."" (Well, you know.)Ultimately, ""The Descendants"" is about King's quest for redemption: as a father, a husband, and a Hawaiian. In a lesser movie, he would move smoothly through the steps of healing and emerge triumphant with a big speech announcing his hard-won wisdom. ""The Descendants"" does not take any easy shortcuts. While King wants to connect with his daughters, he doesn't have a clue how to do it. He, naturally, is also consumed with tracking down his wife's lover (Matthew Lillard) and finds an unlikely ally in Alex; this is hardly the traditional bonding experience for a father and daughter. Clooney, a nominee for a best actor Oscar, is a perfect choice to play King. Looking a bit more haggard than his normal Danny Ocean self, Clooney is as vulnerable as we've ever seen him. We believe it when he turns to his daughter's stoner boyfriend (Nick Krause) for advice.As usual in a Payne movie, all the performances are first-rate, and Shailene Woodley is particularly strong as the frustrated older daughter. Ultimately a comedy, ""The Descendants"" is a rich character study steeped in the romance of Hawaii. Gorgeously shot (I watched the high-definition Blu-ray) and scored with a charming Hawaiian guitar soundtrack, the movie stands proudly next to Payne's best work, and that's high praise.A healthy dose of extras include deleted scenes and several small documentaries, including an exploration of the real-life ""Descendants,"" an examination of the Hawaiian mystique, and a discussion with Clooney and Payne.Review originally published on MyDVDInsider.com.",5,"Payne, Clooney, and team explore the meaning of family and paradise",1332460800,"03 23, 2012",2012,3529,"['Alexander', 'Payne', 'how', 'make', 'character-driven', 'film', 'previous', 'movies', 'Election', 'Sideways', 'good', 'guys', 'are', 'inherently', 'flawed', 'villains', 'have', 'many', 'virtues', 'people', 'constantly', 'get', 'trouble', 'making', 'little', 'decisions', 'have', 'major', 'unforeseen', 'consequences', 'Everything', 'just', 'line', 'heard', 'Payne', 'latest', 'film', 'Descendants', 'neatly', 'up', 'writer-director', 'philosophy', 'Much', 'Matt', 'King', 'George', 'Clooney', 'movie', 'set', 'entirely', 'Hawaii', 'where', 'King', 'life', 'teetering', 'edge', 'picturesque', 'seaside', 'cliffs', 'thrill-seeking', 'wife', 'coma', 'following', 'powerboat', 'accident', 'chances', 'recovery', 'are', 'slim', 'couple', '10-year-old', 'daughter', 'Scottie', 'Amara', 'Miller', 'world', 'King', 'so', 'feckless', 'dad', '17-year-old', 'Alex', 'Shailene', 'Woodley', 'help', 'even', 'already', 'sent', 'boarding', 'school', 'wean', 'off', 'alcohol', 'drugs', 'men', 'other', 'potential', 'source', 'help', 'King', 'father-in-law', 'Robert', 'Forster', 'accident.King', 'family', 'huge', 'piece', 'baggage', 'piece', 'Hawaii', 'soul', 'King', 'family', 'are', 'Haole', 'descendants', 'King', 'Kamehameha', 'family', 'Haole', 'Hawaiian', 'honkey', 'King', 'cousins', 'have', 'squandered', 'vast', 'inheritances', 'King', 'preserved', 'share', 'living', 'comparably', 'frugal', 'life', 'understandably', 'sole', 'trustee', 'family', 'once-vast', 'trust', 'trust', 'one', 'major', 'asset', 'unspoiled', '25,000-acre', 'plot', 'paradise', 'Kauai', 'most', 'King', 'cousins', 'want', 'sell', 'developer', 'sale', 'would', 'infuriate', 'most', 'state', 'Cousin', 'Hugh', 'Beau', 'Bridges', 'clear', 'few', 'hundred', 'million', 'soothes', 'wounded', 'conscience', 'quite', 'nicely.To', 'top', 'off', 'saw', 'movie', 'trailer', 'King', 'learns', 'wife', 'been', 'cheating', 'see', 'King', 'point', 'when', 'Paradise', 'Paradise', 'can', 'go', 'Well', 'know', 'Ultimately', 'Descendants', 'King', 'quest', 'redemption', 'father', 'husband', 'Hawaiian', 'lesser', 'movie', 'would', 'move', 'smoothly', 'steps', 'healing', 'emerge', 'triumphant', 'big', 'speech', 'announcing', 'hard-won', 'wisdom', 'Descendants', 'not', 'take', 'easy', 'shortcuts', 'King', 'connect', 'daughters', ""n't"", 'have', 'clue', 'how', 'do', 'naturally', 'also', 'consumed', 'tracking', 'down', 'wife', 'lover', 'Matthew', 'Lillard', 'unlikely', 'ally', 'Alex', 'hardly', 'traditional', 'bonding', 'experience', 'father', 'daughter', 'Clooney', 'nominee', 'best', 'actor', 'Oscar', 'perfect', 'choice', 'play', 'King', 'Looking', 'bit', 'more', 'haggard', 'normal', 'Danny', 'Ocean', 'Clooney', 'as', 'vulnerable', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'believe', 'when', 'daughter', 'stoner', 'boyfriend', 'Nick', 'Krause', 'advice.As', 'usual', 'Payne', 'movie', 'performances', 'are', 'first-rate', 'Shailene', 'Woodley', 'particularly', 'strong', 'frustrated', 'older', 'daughter', 'Ultimately', 'comedy', 'Descendants', 'rich', 'character', 'study', 'steeped', 'romance', 'Hawaii', 'Gorgeously', 'shot', 'watched', 'high-definition', 'Blu-ray', 'scored', 'charming', 'Hawaiian', 'guitar', 'soundtrack', 'movie', 'proudly', 'next', 'Payne', 'best', 'work', 'high', 'praise.A', 'healthy', 'dose', 'extras', 'include', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'several', 'small', 'documentaries', 'including', 'exploration', 'real-life', 'Descendants', 'examination', 'Hawaiian', 'mystique', 'discussion', 'Clooney', 'Payne.Review', 'originally', 'published', 'MyDVDInsider.com']",The Descendants

In deciding on whether or not I find a film good or not I focus on three key elements in my decision, whether or not it has likeable protagonists, whether or not it's boring, and whether or not the film achieves in what it sets out to do, as in being funny if it's a comedy, being serious and dramatic as a drama, and being frightening as a horror film, it succeeds at being dramatic, and it succeeds in not being boring, but it fails as far as characters go, I didn't particularly care for any of the characters and because of this I could really care less about what happened to them. In fact, it isn't surprising that the wife cheated on the George Clooney's character because he was such a prick. The acting was good I suppose and I enjoyed the setting, but it added very little to the plot or story, this film could just as easily have taken place in California or even Florida. Despite taking place in such a beautiful, paradise setting the story is too dark and serious, which further weakens the appeal of this film.

1429272,A38YDXWC0WCO4J,B004UXUX4Q,SeaGoddess2403,"[19, 47]","** MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS**This film gets only one star due to its beautiful scenery. Being filmed on location in Hawaii is the only thing that this movie has going for it. In fact, Hawaii is the only star of this movie worth watching.How can anyone like this film? The rave reviews confuse me. How it received nominations for both Golden Globes and now Academy Awards is mystifying. The only thing I can say about that is it's due to of Clooney's involvement that they included it at all. Hollywood and Clooney have a love affair, one that has been ongoing for quite some time. Try putting in a less Academy-loved actor (Leonardo DiCaprio? Ed Norton? Both extremely fine actors consistently overlooked by Hollywood) in the Clooney role and you would have a movie that no one heard of; without Clooney, The Descendants would have flown right under the radar onto DVD without so much as an utterance.Clooney is an actor that has made a few quality films and a bunch of stinkers. I am particularly fond of ""Up in the Air"" and ""Michael Clayton"" as being his best work. ""Up in the Air"" was a brilliant movie showcasing the hard times we are all facing in this economy. ""Michael Clayton"" had an incredibly strong, intricate script and superb acting. Both of those film show a much stronger sense of self for Clooney and showcased more emotional depth.""The Descendants"" is painfully bad, excrutiatingly boring, highly depressing, very shallow and tedious to watch. I try to view all movies with an open mind and find something about it to enjoy. Whether it be a fabulous script, great cast, beautiful cinematography, incredible score, there's usually one thing I can bring. Aside from its location, there is very little.Let me start with the characters. Clooney's character of Matt King is wooden, unsympathetic and, worst of all, a hypocrite. You'll have to see the movie to understand why. The children in this movie are spoiled, bratty, foul mouthed and highly annoying. Ungrateful best sums them up in one word, as they do have a good life but don't seem to care. Then, you have the friend of the eldest daughter who is smug, arrogant, stupid - just beyond awful. The rest of the cast is equally horrible, with the exception of a small but great turn by the fabulous Robert Forster as King's father-in-law.Then there is the script. There were unfunny jabs at Alzheimers and in poor taste comments about a woman lying in a coma (who, her husband so callously told her best friend, ""You just put makeup on a corpse""). Add to that the infinite walking and running. Two hours of Clooney running down the street; running on the beach; walking on the beach; jetting from one Hawaiian island to another and walking some more; around and around it went. And finally,the worst part of the story is the reason why he wants to find his dying wife's lover (which he spent more than half the movie doing). It's completely ridiculous and unrealistic, and he enlists the help of his teenage daughter to track this guy down. Way to father there, sir.So that's really all there is to say about this terrible film. If you are looking to see one of the Oscar nominated films, I would instead try ""Hugo"" or ""The Artist"". And for those who may not be aware, check out ""Margin Call"" (nominated for Best Original Screenplay), an outstanding straight-to-DVD release about the current banking crisis we are facing as a country.

In the beginning of the movie, it made me wish I was back in Maui because of the beautiful scenes and music. Then the movie started and it went downhill from there. Most of what I saw was about two incredibly bratty kids (one a college student) who curse, throw up their middle fingers, disrespect their father and think it's OK to completely ignore anything he says. Then the college student brought along her incredibly tacky guy friend who thinks jokes about mentally challenged people and the elderly are funny. That's in addition to making fun of a grandmother with Alzheimer's and not knowing how to greet a friend's father. I liked watching George Clooney, but the rest of this film was a waste of my time. By 56 minutes I gave up. I thought it was ridiculous to try to find the ""other man"" to let him know Clooney's character's wife was about to have the plug pulled. When I think of good movies that fight to get filming money and then see this kind of stuff make it to the big screen, I realize time and time again how Hollywood gets it wrong. I don't even care what the ending was. I didn't like any character but Clooney's and got tired of people chatting with him about Hawaiian property. If I was him in this movie, I'd pull the plug on myself. I definitely could've given this movie a better shot if the supporting actors' personalities weren't so irritating.

1429276,A35VI0H5AFHOJ5,B004UXUX4Q,Sharon Isch,"[1, 1]","What a great role for Clooney. His character is a wealthy Hawaiian lawyer who has just learned that his comatose wife's condition after a boating accident is not improving and they may have to pull the plug. His daughters--one 10, the other 17--are acting out in ways he hasn't a clue how to handle. He holds the reins of a family trust that owns a huge chunk of scenic land and the cousins are queuing up on both sides of the question of whether he should sell and make them all rich or hold on to it. Now his teenage daughter tells him she's seen evidence that she thinks indicates Mom had been cheating on him. Here's a man who's never met a situation he couldn't handle with ease. Now his life is threatening to come undone from every direction. Yet you know he's going to somehow figure out a way to handle all this. What you may not be expecting under the circumstances is just how very funny much of that will turn out to be.Add to all of the above a perfectly cast supporting cast. The kids who play his kids are required to play almost as wide a range of emotion as Clooney is and they play it with an ease and naturalness that is as believable as his. The young actor who plays the teenage daughter's dorky hang-around boyfriend provides delicious comic relief just when it's needed. The actors who play the grandparents are superb in small but important roles. Beau Bridges gets only a tiny bit of screen time as one of the cousins, but he makes the most of it. And then there's the marvelous Judy Greer. I've long loved her work in ditsy comic sidekick roles, but here she leaves the funny business to others and plays a serious role beautifully--both the quiet warmth and the heartbreaking bravado. And let us not forget the actress playing the comatose wife...that role couldn't have been easy either. Very highly recommended.",5,"Wow!

1429281,A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM,B004UXUX4Q,Stanley Crowe,"[1, 1]","This movie created considerable buzz when it was released, but it's hard to see exactly why at this distance.  It's well acted and well shot, but it seems thin, and a movie about the weight of the past on the present can't afford to seem thin.  There are two pasts in question: first, the past of the marriage of Matt and Elizabeth King (George Clooney is Matt); then there's the past of the Hawaiian island, a large chunk of which Matt's family has inherited and which is held under trust, with Matt the trustee.  We never see Matt's marriage; we have to take it for granted that it's at a crisis (because we're told), but Elizabeth is in an irreversible coma when George learns, from his elder daughter, that she was having an affair at the time of the accident that has made her comatose.  If ever flashbacks of a substantive kind were needed, it's in a situation like this.  Without them, we remain a bit disconnected from Matt's inner life.  Clooney has to try to suggest a complexity that the movie doesn't underwrite, and I don't think that an actor can easily do that.  We see the past of the island insofar as it effects Matt's family in the shots of the land they own -- beautiful unspoiled land.  We can see it, and we get a connection to it that we don't get to Matt's marriage (shots of his comatose wife don't do that).  The two come together when Matt learns that the man with whom his wife is having an affair stands to profit very handily for managing the transfer of property in the event that the sale goes through.  Matt as trustee has the power of decision -- he can make his rather wastrel relatives millionaires, or he can preserve the land (at least for a while).  If he doesn't sell, what's his motive?George Clooney has too little to work with here.  He does fine, but it's a thin role.  Matt's daughters, with less history, are more interesting, and the two young actors (Amara Miller and Shailene Woodley) are very good.  Beau Bridges, as one of Matt's cousins hoping for millions, is underused.  Judy Greer, as the wife of the man whom Elizabeth has been involved with, has a strong scene near the end.  It's credible because she plays a woman reacting to a history she doesn't really know, and she does it splendidly.The problems, then, are with the concept (and to a lesser degree with the writing).  Obviously, it's tonally challenging to blend comic elements with so many shots of a dying woman -- and Elizabeth takes the whole movie to die.  To an extent, Payne manages the blend reasonably -- thanks partly to Sid (Nick Krause), Matt's elder daughter's surfer dude boyfriend, a character who ends up being less stupid than he looks.  Clooney's contribution to the humor -- quite well done -- is his acting the part of a father who is learning on the job, so to speak.  Still -- it doesn't add up to much.  It lacks real emotional power.

1429282,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B004UXUX4Q,Steven Aldersley,"[3, 5]","The Descendants (2011)Comedy, Drama, 115 minutesDirected by Alexander PayneStarring George Clooney, Shailene Woodley, Nick Krause and Amara Miller***Spoilers within***It took me about two minutes to decide that The Descendants was going to be my kind of film. It happened during Clooney's opening voice-over in which he observed that, just because they live in paradise, Hawaiians aren't exempt from the usual problems people face. That statement caught my attention because it's true, but it also alerted me to the possibility that the script would be both truthful and more intelligent than most.Matt King (Clooney) is the kind of character that I can identify with. He's a lawyer and his job is more important to him than his family. He regularly travels to neighboring islands on business and hasn't had a proper relationship with his wife and two daughters for several years. When his wife has an accident which places her in a coma, Matt's life changes instantly. He has to be a father to his daughters and he's completely unprepared.His younger daughter, Scottie (Miller), is 10 years old. Matt last took care of her when she was three. His other daughter, Alex (Woodley), is 17 and is in a boarding school to help her overcome alcohol and drug problems. When Matt learns that his wife will never wake up, he takes Scottie to collect Alex from the school. Alex is drunk when he turns up and openly defies him early in the film.Place yourself in Matt's situation for a moment. How would you attempt to console your daughters? What would help you establish some kind of connection with them? If you're all they have left, how will you make them feel as if everything is going to be all right?Matt isn't happy with Alex because she argued with her mother the last time they spoke, but her reasoning is sound; she found out that her mother was cheating on Matt. Alex insists that her boyfriend, Sid (Krause), stays with her while she is home. Sid appears to be fairly dumb and occasionally stoned. Matt is not happy.The story really takes off when Matt takes Sid and his daughters to a neighboring island in search of his wife's lover. Another story thread explains that Matt and his many cousins are descended from Hawaiian royalty and own a piece of land worth around $500 million. Matt is the sole trustee and must organize the group of cousins and decide who to sell the land to. A complication emerges later in the story which could have a major impact on his decision, but I won't reveal any more of the film's secrets.I've watched Clooney develop as an actor over the past few years. He used to be criticized for ""always being Clooney"", but I think he's proved that there's a lot more to him. His timing is excellent and he always delivers his comedic lines well, but he has to show considerable range as Matt. Many of the scenes require him to show his feelings without the use of words. He goes through a lot of emotions during the film and pulls it off perfectly whether the situations are positive or negative. His performance is human, real, touching, emotional and understandable. I thought he should have won the Oscar for his performance in Up in the Air, but this latest oversight is a glaring error.What I really liked about the film was the character development. We see Matt grow as expected, but I was stunned by the development shown in Alex and Sid. They both have more to them than meets the eye and I ended up liking both characters tremendously.The conclusions that Matt reaches by the end of the story seem plausible and fit well with his development as a father and as a responsible adult. I might have reached the same conclusions if I were placed in his shoes.You'll definitely laugh during The Descendants and you may even be moved to tears.Alexander Payne, Nat Faxon and Jim Rash won the Oscar for their adaptation of Kaui Hart Hemmings' book and it was thoroughly deserved. It's rare to witness a film with such intelligent writing. The characters and situations are always believable. If you were in their position, you might find yourself behaving in the same way.The Descendants is my favorite film of 2011 and, in a few years, I suspect many will wonder why it didn't win for Best Picture when we find out whether The Artist has lasting appeal.",5,My favorite film of 2011,1331424000,"03 11, 2012",2012,4283,"['Descendants', '2011', 'Comedy', 'Drama', '115', 'minutesDirected', 'Alexander', 'PayneStarring', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Shailene', 'Woodley', 'Nick', 'Krause', 'Amara', 'Miller***Spoilers', 'within***It', 'took', 'two', 'minutes', 'decide', 'Descendants', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'kind', 'film', 'happened', 'Clooney', 'opening', 'voice-over', 'observed', 'just', 'live', 'paradise', 'Hawaiians', 'are', ""n't"", 'exempt', 'usual', 'problems', 'people', 'face', 'statement', 'caught', 'attention', 'true', 'also', 'alerted', 'possibility', 'script', 'would', 'be', 'truthful', 'more', 'intelligent', 'most.Matt', 'King', 'Clooney', 'kind', 'character', 'can', 'identify', 'lawyer', 'job', 'more', 'important', 'family', 'regularly', 'neighboring', 'islands', 'business', ""n't"", 'had', 'proper', 'relationship', 'wife', 'two', 'daughters', 'several', 'years', 'When', 'wife', 'accident', 'coma', 'Matt', 'life', 'changes', 'instantly', 'be', 'father', 'daughters', 'completely', 'unprepared.His', 'younger', 'daughter', 'Scottie', 'Miller', '10', 'years', 'old', 'Matt', 'last', 'took', 'care', 'when', 'was', 'three', 'other', 'daughter', 'Alex', 'Woodley', '17', 'boarding', 'school', 'help', 'overcome', 'alcohol', 'drug', 'problems', 'When', 'Matt', 'wife', 'will', 'never', 'wake', 'up', 'Scottie', 'collect', 'Alex', 'school', 'Alex', 'drunk', 'when', 'up', 'openly', 'early', 'film.Place', 'Matt', 'situation', 'moment', 'How', 'would', 'attempt', 'console', 'daughters', 'What', 'would', 'help', 'establish', 'kind', 'connection', ""'re"", 'have', 'left', 'how', 'will', 'make', 'feel', 'everything', 'going', 'be', 'right', 'Matt', ""n't"", 'happy', 'Alex', 'argued', 'mother', 'last', 'time', 'spoke', 'reasoning', 'sound', 'found', 'out', 'mother', 'was', 'cheating', 'Matt', 'Alex', 'boyfriend', 'Sid', 'Krause', 'home', 'Sid', 'be', 'fairly', 'dumb', 'occasionally', 'stoned', 'Matt', 'not', 'happy.The', 'story', 'really', 'off', 'when', 'Matt', 'Sid', 'daughters', 'neighboring', 'island', 'search', 'wife', 'lover', 'story', 'thread', 'Matt', 'many', 'cousins', 'are', 'descended', 'Hawaiian', 'royalty', 'own', 'piece', 'land', 'worth', 'around', '500', 'million', 'Matt', 'sole', 'trustee', 'must', 'organize', 'group', 'cousins', 'decide', 'who', 'sell', 'land', 'complication', 'later', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'major', 'impact', 'decision', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'more', 'film', 'secrets.I', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'Clooney', 'develop', 'actor', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'used', 'be', 'criticized', 'always', 'being', 'Clooney', 'think', 'proved', 'lot', 'more', 'timing', 'excellent', 'always', 'comedic', 'lines', 'well', 'show', 'considerable', 'range', 'Matt', 'Many', 'scenes', 'require', 'show', 'feelings', 'use', 'words', 'lot', 'emotions', 'film', 'pulls', 'off', 'perfectly', 'situations', 'are', 'positive', 'negative', 'performance', 'human', 'real', 'touching', 'emotional', 'understandable', 'thought', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'Up', 'Air', 'latest', 'oversight', 'glaring', 'error.What', 'really', 'liked', 'film', 'was', 'character', 'development', 'see', 'Matt', 'grow', 'expected', 'was', 'stunned', 'development', 'shown', 'Alex', 'Sid', 'have', 'more', 'eye', 'ended', 'up', 'liking', 'characters', 'tremendously.The', 'conclusions', 'Matt', 'end', 'story', 'seem', 'plausible', 'fit', 'well', 'development', 'father', 'responsible', 'adult', 'might', 'have', 'reached', 'same', 'conclusions', 'were', 'placed', 'shoes.You', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'Descendants', 'may', 'even', 'be', 'moved', 'tears.Alexander', 'Payne', 'Nat', 'Faxon', 'Jim', 'Rash', 'won', 'Oscar', 'adaptation', 'Kaui', 'Hart', 'Hemmings', 'book', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'deserved', 'rare', 'witness', 'film', 'such', 'intelligent', 'writing', 'characters', 'situations', 'are', 'always', 'believable', 'were', 'position', 'might', 'find', 'behaving', 'same', 'way.The', 'Descendants', 'favorite', 'film', '2011', 'few', 'years', 'suspect', 'many', 'will', 'wonder', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', 'Best', 'Picture', 'when', 'find', 'out', 'Artist', 'lasting', 'appeal']",The Descendants

1429285,ASF2Z8OJR0TP3,B004UXUX4Q,S. T. Peterson,"[3, 12]","The basic premise to this movie is a married father of two girls wife gets seriously injured in a boating accident. As she lays in a coma he finds out she had an affair.The problem is the father is a weak man. He is a horrible father. His two daughters are wild, out of control, foul, filthy mouthed brats that he blames on his wife's medical condition. He isn't a good husband from what we are told. Yes he provides the house and material things but we learn his wife fell in love with another man. Is that his fault? Well we are led to believe that. He doesn't get along with his relatives. There is in-fighting on what to do with inherited land.  This same situation puts a rift between him and his neighbors too. He doesn't really have any friends. We see his wife's friends but not his. He even has to go pry out of a couple of them that his wife is indeed been having an affair and that she was going to divorce him. And in the end he has to murder his wife by ""pulling the plug"" as they say. So who wants to watch a movie about such a person? I don't. I saw a review that said that this movie was depressing. It isn't so much as depressing as it is icky. It is uncomfortable watching the, now, proverbial train wreck in front of you.It isn't even sad. I mean it is sad in watching what appears to be common in America--immature parents raising out of control kids that mess up society forcing their dysfunctionalism on the rest of us. That is sad. But it is not sad in a tear jerker way. I suspect, for me, that the entire reason is not the weak characters we are watching but that George Looney is simply not a good actor in  my eyes> I think he is another born into stardom actor who can do a better job than say Madonna  or Princess Stephanie so he stays around. But in every movie I saw that he happened to be in he just stands around reading lines out loud half heartedly with the same mannerisms. In the movie he can't even pull off the ""I'm so cool and goodlooking"" mannerisms as he looks old (his age) and almost like a puffy faced drunk.If all of this is not reason enough to pass on paying 3.99 for a VOD rental then if you are like me you would want to know the liberal propaganda the movie spews. There is the native Hawaiian subtexts. Research that and find out what radicals float in those circles. I mean why not just have a movie set in Hawaii? It is everywhere in this movie down to the cheesy Don Ho (spelling?) songs . . . scratch ""cheesy"" . . . read annoying. There is the capitalism vs environmentalists issue that we hear daily on a national political level starting in 2009 to 2012. There is the anti-bullying stuff we hear in the news where kids are set up to be perpetual victims. Etc etc etc. The profanity is not just your typical curse word here and there. This is some vile language and what is disturbing is it was almost always the kid characters saying this stuff. The male teenage kid who acts, looks, and talks like a pot head and just as matter of factly comments on it.Weak characters. Weak political arguments/minds at play behind this movie. Weak movie.

If you want to see a film with young girls whose lines consisted almost entirely of obscenities and treating people, especially their father, with gross disrespect, this is the film for you. I felt so sorry for Clooney's character, whose main flaw seemed only to be that he worked too hard, but otherwise loved his daughters and his family and friends. None of them seem to return his affection, blaming him for his wife's infidelities and the accident that killed her. I wanted him to stand up to all of them, especially his daughters and his wife's best friend who wailed that the ""affair wasn't the wife's fault..."" to him, and he did confront his older daughter at the comatose mother's bedside, only to have both daughters hurl obscenities at each other, a few moments later, as the younger cretin child brings a friend in to display her mother. The ""wonderfully mellow"" Sid is also a completely brainless and mannerless waste of air as he laughs at the grandmother, who has Alzheimer's. The point of the film was that Clooney had been an absent father who had failed his daughters, but I certainly didn't see that the mother had been a stellar parent, with two hoodlum, filthy mouthed daughters. I actually didn't see the end of the film, I couldn't stand any more.

1429290,A1M0OSCFOAMAZO,B004UXUX4Q,taaj,"[4, 6]","I watched this looking for the funny best movie of the year that I was told was in store for me. I didn't find it. Here's what I got instead.Characters I can't respect or identify with- Clooney is an out-of-touch wimp with no healthy boundaries. When his daughter tells him that his wife, who is in a coma, has cheated on him, he decides to share all his next steps with his daughter and her friend. I suppose that is why his kids don't respect him and curse in front of him. SPOILER ALERT: His wife's lover's wife comes to the hospital (flying from another island) to see his dying wife because her husband won't because he doesn't love her. Then she tells the dying woman that she forgives her. That is just not realistic. It's bizarre.Wasted location- There are LOTS of movies where the location is a huge part of the movie. It's like a silent supporting actor. This film looks as it it were set up that way, but fails to make that happen. I don't know if it is the way it was shot or what, but Hawaii never comes across as this pristine, romantic landscape worth saving. Since a big chunk of the plot revolves around that, it's a huge disappointment.Lack of cohesiveness- It looks like this was supposed to be a movie about a family drama, death, love, life, the continuation of life, and healing. Bubbles of those things pop up, but they never blend. They never gel. They are just elements instead of ingredients woven into the fabric of the story that create a cohesive picture. It's like telling a story by saying, ""This and this, and then that and that. Get it?""There were funny moments that made my lips move to the side of my mouth, but nothing laugh-out-loud or even really smile cracking humor.It's not a complete waste.

But don't worry, he narrates for us so we don't forget he is in the film. His wife Elizabeth (Patricia Hastie) has a boating accident we don't get to see because Clooney wasn't there. She is in a coma and is going to die. Clooney has been so involved with his job (he has a big deal in the works) that he has alienated himself from his family. Now he is attempting to reconnect with his two daughters, the older of which has harsh feelings for her mother.The story develops to a point where Elizabeth's coma becomes almost secondary. Clooney's deal involves all of his cousins and a realtor Clooney would rather not deal with for personal reasons. In order to help her cope, the older daughter Alexandra (Shailene Woodley) has a boyfriend (Nick Krause) who hangs out with her during this interim.The movie is a drama, but the dysfunctional family provides for light humor and some dark humor to keep the film from getting too heavy.

1429297,A3NKKLHHSS1GNO,B004UXUX4Q,ThirtyMinuteReviews,"[1, 1]","There is a lot to like about The Descendants.  First, it stars George Clooney, who has become one of the best actors of the 2000s and 2010s with convincing performances like those in Michael Clayton and The Ides of March.  This go-round adds to the list of winning and memorable roles.  All are unique, but all uniquely Clooney.The man is a movie star, plain and simple.  He can cover the full gamut of emotions and affects from depressed to sad to annoyed to upset to angry, and everything in between.  In The Descendants he displays his acting chops for portraying sadness, confusion, rage, and remorse convincingly.  Although his protagonist is a faulted man, neglectful of his family and too focused on his finances and business, there is a reality and humanity that Clooney brings to Matt King.  With his universal winner personality and natural charm, Clooney makes King seem more burdened than burdensome.Second, you will feel transported to Hawaii.  Hawaii plays a big role here and one that only an experienced filmmaker could incorporate seamlessly.  The distinctive ukulele music, the lush tropical landscape, the omnipresent sense of separation from the mainland, the laid-back dress--all of these elements of The Descendants factor into painting a picture of a place that is very different from anywhere.  Different rules apply.  Lawyers don't wear powersuits; they sport goofy, floral short-sleeved button-downs.One thing that was striking to this Lower 48er is that, although Hawaii is perceived as a tropical vacation spot for most of the world, it is also a home to many people.  Along with being a ""home"" comes a number of generic and commonplace facets of the landscape that few consider.  There is rush hour traffic.  There are suburbs with cookie-cutter subdivisions.  Skyscrapers filled with offices dot the downtown of populated cities.  Most importantly, even in a green and temperate vacation climate, there are still places that its inhabitants go to escape from ""paradise.""  The Descendants does an excellent job of bringing these realities to the viewer in subtle ways, like by incorporating a mini-getaway to a beach house on another island into the plot.  No matter where you live, even in a touristy place like Hawaii, the inhabitants still like a change of scenery.  Humans try to escape their day-to-day perspective by changing scenery to contemplate, refocus, and reinvigorate, even in places where the scenery is amazing.  Hawaii is no different, and this film drives the point home.Third, the complexities of family are incorporated effectively in a few different ways.  King's daughters are at different places in their lives.  One is a preteen, just getting a minor taste of the difficulty of growing up with peer pressure, expectations, rejections, and bouncing emotions.  Another is firmly and typically teen, exhibiting a rebellious streak that King is forced to manage and harness to his advantage.  He does so even without the help, and you could say the hindrance, of his comatose and unfaithful wife.The Descendants also creatively explores and highlights the dynamics of extended-family relationships and wrangling over inheritances.  Without giving away the resolution, a number of different and diverse relatives have their say in a decision that King is forced to make.  The film reminds us that we do not pick these people in our lives.  They are family, and we are stuck with them.  Some we will appreciate and embrace.  Others we will merely tolerate and neglect, or even outright reject.  When those family ties also are bound up with monetary concerns, legacies, perceived wishes of descendants, and the future of all concerned parties, it gets messy, testy, and there are no easy solutions.  We see all of this in play through Matt King.Finally, The Descendants takes a complicated story and makes it easy to get drawn in.  There is a lot going on.  An extramarital affair, bubbling teen angst, plotted revenge, inconvenient death, family strife, business ventures, not to mention lots of names to remember and cross-relationships.  In the end, you realize that the focus is Matt King and his discombobulated and imperfect life.  We only see a slice of it over maybe a period of weeks, but it is enough to paint a multifaceted, challenging, and realistic painting of the highs and lows of life.",5,Clooney at his best.,1361491200,"02 22, 2013",2013,4349,"['lot', 'like', 'Descendants', 'First', 'George', 'Clooney', 'who', 'become', 'one', 'best', 'actors', '2000s', '2010s', 'convincing', 'performances', 'Michael', 'Clayton', 'Ides', 'March', 'go-round', 'list', 'winning', 'memorable', 'roles', 'are', 'unique', 'uniquely', 'Clooney.The', 'man', 'movie', 'star', 'plain', 'simple', 'can', 'cover', 'full', 'gamut', 'emotions', 'affects', 'depressed', 'sad', 'annoyed', 'upset', 'angry', 'everything', 'Descendants', 'acting', 'chops', 'portraying', 'sadness', 'confusion', 'rage', 'remorse', 'convincingly', 'protagonist', 'faulted', 'man', 'neglectful', 'family', 'too', 'focused', 'finances', 'business', 'reality', 'humanity', 'Clooney', 'Matt', 'King', 'universal', 'winner', 'personality', 'natural', 'charm', 'Clooney', 'King', 'seem', 'more', 'burdened', 'burdensome.Second', 'will', 'feel', 'transported', 'Hawaii', 'Hawaii', 'big', 'role', 'here', 'one', 'only', 'experienced', 'filmmaker', 'could', 'incorporate', 'seamlessly', 'distinctive', 'ukulele', 'music', 'lush', 'tropical', 'landscape', 'omnipresent', 'sense', 'separation', 'mainland', 'laid-back', 'dress', 'elements', 'Descendants', 'factor', 'painting', 'picture', 'place', 'very', 'different', 'anywhere', 'Different', 'rules', 'apply', 'Lawyers', 'do', ""n't"", 'wear', 'powersuits', 'sport', 'goofy', 'floral', 'short-sleeved', 'button-downs.One', 'thing', 'was', 'striking', 'Lower', '48er', 'Hawaii', 'perceived', 'tropical', 'vacation', 'spot', 'most', 'world', 'also', 'home', 'many', 'people', 'being', 'home', 'number', 'generic', 'commonplace', 'facets', 'landscape', 'few', 'consider', 'rush', 'hour', 'traffic', 'are', 'suburbs', 'cookie-cutter', 'subdivisions', 'Skyscrapers', 'filled', 'offices', 'dot', 'downtown', 'populated', 'cities', 'Most', 'importantly', 'even', 'green', 'temperate', 'vacation', 'climate', 'are', 'still', 'places', 'inhabitants', 'go', 'escape', 'paradise', 'Descendants', 'excellent', 'job', 'bringing', 'realities', 'viewer', 'subtle', 'ways', 'incorporating', 'mini-getaway', 'beach', 'house', 'island', 'plot', 'matter', 'where', 'live', 'even', 'touristy', 'place', 'Hawaii', 'inhabitants', 'still', 'change', 'scenery', 'Humans', 'try', 'escape', 'day-to-day', 'perspective', 'changing', 'scenery', 'contemplate', 'refocus', 'reinvigorate', 'even', 'places', 'where', 'scenery', 'amazing', 'Hawaii', 'different', 'film', 'point', 'home.Third', 'complexities', 'family', 'are', 'incorporated', 'effectively', 'few', 'different', 'ways', 'King', 'daughters', 'are', 'different', 'places', 'lives', 'One', 'preteen', 'just', 'getting', 'minor', 'taste', 'difficulty', 'growing', 'up', 'peer', 'pressure', 'expectations', 'rejections', 'bouncing', 'emotions', 'firmly', 'typically', 'teen', 'exhibiting', 'rebellious', 'streak', 'King', 'forced', 'manage', 'harness', 'advantage', 'so', 'even', 'help', 'could', 'say', 'hindrance', 'comatose', 'unfaithful', 'wife.The', 'Descendants', 'also', 'creatively', 'dynamics', 'extended-family', 'relationships', 'wrangling', 'over', 'inheritances', 'giving', 'away', 'resolution', 'number', 'different', 'diverse', 'relatives', 'have', 'say', 'decision', 'King', 'forced', 'make', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'pick', 'people', 'lives', 'are', 'family', 'are', 'stuck', 'will', 'appreciate', 'embrace', 'Others', 'will', 'merely', 'tolerate', 'neglect', 'even', 'outright', 'reject', 'When', 'family', 'ties', 'also', 'are', 'bound', 'up', 'monetary', 'concerns', 'legacies', 'perceived', 'wishes', 'descendants', 'future', 'concerned', 'parties', 'messy', 'testy', 'are', 'easy', 'solutions', 'see', 'play', 'Matt', 'King.Finally', 'Descendants', 'complicated', 'story', 'easy', 'get', 'drawn', 'lot', 'going', 'extramarital', 'affair', 'bubbling', 'teen', 'angst', 'plotted', 'revenge', 'inconvenient', 'death', 'family', 'strife', 'business', 'ventures', 'not', 'mention', 'lots', 'names', 'remember', 'cross-relationships', 'end', 'realize', 'focus', 'Matt', 'King', 'discombobulated', 'imperfect', 'life', 'only', 'see', 'slice', 'maybe', 'period', 'weeks', 'enough', 'paint', 'multifaceted', 'challenging', 'realistic', 'painting', 'highs', 'lows', 'life']",The Descendants

1429301,A4JHEO7H330AF,B004UXUX4Q,Tom Brody,"[1, 1]","THE DESCENDANTS (2011) is a psycho-drama that centers around one family. In addition to the family, the characters include a married couple (Mark and Kai) who are friends of the family, and a paramour (Brian Speer) and his wife (Julie). The family takes the form of George Clooney, his comatose wife who is eventually taken off life-support, and their two teenaged daughters. The older daughter is Shailene Woodley (a hottie) and the younger daughter is Amara Miller (a plump girl). Shailene has a charismatic boyfriend played by Nick Krause. The film trods the well-worn themes of grief and death, betrayal in marriage, and teen rebellion. The film integrates these themes together as an exceptionally unified whole, resulting in a unique work of art. The film also has the plot element of a wife who decides to have an affair because her husband spends too much time at work, and too little time with his family (but what family in the United States of America does not have this particular problem?). What is further unique about this film, is the 1950s-style Hawaiian music that serves as a divider between each theme. Many of the out-of-door scenes take place under overcast skies, where the landscape features plants found in Hawaii and mountain formations that are characteristic of Hawaii (for example, I noticed and admired the Waimanalo region of the Ko'olau Mountains).OPENING MONOLOGUE. The film begins with Clooney's wife, enjoying a motorboat ride in the ocean with Waikiki in the background. She is grinning as the boat bounces up and down on the waves, but she says nothing. Then, Clooney recites, ""My friends on the mainland think just because we live in Hawaii we're in paradise. Like a permanent vacation. We're all sipping mai tais, shaking our hips, catching waves. Are they insane? Do they think we're immune to life? How can they possibly think that our families are less screwed-up, our cancers less fatal, our heartaches less painful?"" (That is a great monologue, in my opinion.)OPENING SCENES. The first scene shows Clooney's wife in a long-term coma, due to her motorboat accident. At the time, the boat was being driven by a family friend named Troy. Clooney continues his monologue, and he reveals that he spends too much time at work, and sacrifices time with his family.AMARA ACTS UP. The next scene provides character development for Amara, the 10-year old daughter, and reveal that the mother's coma is causing Amara to ""act up."" Amara's school complains that Amara had submitted a photo scrapbook showing various photos of her comatose mother. Amara defends her scrapbook, and insists that it is ""art."" An irate mother complains to Clooney that Amara had sent her daughter a text message reading, ""WE ALL KNOW YOU GREW [bad word] OVER THE SUMMER."" Shortly after that, Amara is shown tossing lawn furniture into the family swimming pool.PRINCESS KE'ALOHE'ANI. Clooney resumes his monologue, and reveals that his great great grandmother was Princess Ke'alohe'ani, who was a descendent of King Kamahameha. Clooney reveals that he is the sole trustee of a large amount of land in Kauai, and that he is preparing to sell the land. A continuing issue in this movie is whether he should sell the land to a local developer, to a developer on the mainland, or to donate it as a park thereby preventing any commercial development (Don't worry, I do not reveal the fate of this land).DEALING WITH GRIEF. At 14 minutes into the film, we see a married couple (Mark and Kai) visiting the comatose wife. Kai is putting make-up on the comatose wife. At 16 minutes, Troy says to Clooney, ""I've been praying for her every day . . . last week I talked to her and she moved her hand and I was encouraged."" Clooney perceives that Troy is full of bull-bleep and he is annoyed, and snaps, ""That's enough!"" (It was not clear to me if Troy was expressing his grief, or if Troy was hoping to receive a greater portion of the sales money from the inherited property on Kauai.)SHAILENE ACTS UP. Shailene, who is a hot 17-year old, is shown at 19 minutes into the movie, at her private high school on the Big Island. Clooney visits her, in an effort to solidify his fraying family. Clooney's narrative reveals that Shailene is taking drugs and going out with older guys. In the next scene, taking place at their home on Oahu, Shailene displays her attitude in a dialogue with Clooney: ""I have gotten my act together, I was just drinking . . . what if I got drunk on the one night you stopped by, so [bad word] you."" Shailene continues, and complains to her father (George Clooney) about his perpetual absence from his family. Shailene says, ""Maybe if you spent more time with her [Amara] she wouldn't act like a complete [unintelligible].""HANKY-PANKY. At 25 minutes into the film, Clooney reveals to Shailene that the mother will be taken off life support. This dialogue takes place in the back yard, and Shailene is in the pool. Shailene immediately submerges herself, and we see that her face is contorted with pain, because of the bad news. Then she surfaces, and Clooney asks her to assist him in informing various friends and relatives about the plan to take the mother off life support. But Shailene does not want to cooperate and she scoffs at the idea. At first, the viewer will perceive Shailene as displaying attitude, but the viewer will be treated to a little surprise. Shailene exclaims, ""You really don't have a clue, do you. Dad, dad . . . mom was cheating on you. When I was home at Christmas, I caught her with a guy . . . you didn't even suspect, right? You were so busy . . . he had his hand on her ass, it was so gross . . . a few days later I knew what she was doing, like I'm [bad word] blind and then she got like super mad and yelled and denied it . . . I decided I didn't want anything more to do with her.""TURNING POINT IN THE STORY. After Shailene's revelation, Clooney asks, ""Who is he?"" This is a turning point in the story, because after this point, Clooney plays detective and seeks out the paramour's identity (it is Brian Speer, a real estate developer). At 30 minutes into the movie, Clooney runs down his street to a neighbor's house (Mark and Kai), and without any words of introduction, he demands, ""Who is he?"" Mark immediately understands the question, but he just rolls his eyes. Kai defends the wife's infidelity, because of Clooney's devotion to his work, and absences from home.PUTTING LIPSTICK ON A CORPSE. Clooney confronts Kai and demands, ""Who his he, did she love him?"" But Kai defends the cheating wife, ""I won't betray her because she is not here to defend herself . . . it's not her fault. Your marriage was not . . . she was lonely."" ""DON'T TALK TO ME IN CLICHES,"" retorts Clooney, feeling disgusted with Kai's rationalization of his wife's hanky-panky. Clooney angrily scolds Kai, ""You probably egged her on, in order to add a little drama to your life without any actual risk!"" Clooney then refers to the earlier visit by Mark and Kai, to the hospital, to see the comatose wife. Clooney refers to Kai's behavior at putting makeup on the comatose wife, and he exclaims, ""YOU WERE PUTTING LIPSTICK ON A CORPSE!"" Kai breaks down and cries. Then Clooney turns and leaves, and briskly walks back home. Marks runs out of his house and catches up with Clooney, and reveals the name of the paramour. Clooney pauses on a stone bridge, sobs for a moment, and then continues walking home. In the next scene, Nick Krause (Shailene's boyfriend) makes his entrance. Krause provides a bit of comic relief, now and then, for the rest of the movie. (I will not reveal any more of the story. As the plot continues, the film continues to reveal itself as a great work of art.)CONCLUSION. It is rare to encounter a movie with so much dialogue, where the dialogue is so skillfully and artfully wrought. In my opinion, THE DESCENDANTS is a true milestone in movie-making. There do exist a few other artfully-wrought psychological dramas that include hanky-panky as a theme. Of these, what I recommend is NO DOWN PAYMENT with Tony Randall, and RAGE TO LIVE with Suzanne Pleshette. FIVE STARS.By the way, it is the case that Amazon.com posted a review by Kathleen Fennessy (please see Fennessy's review above.).  Any person who has lived in Hawaii for a year or so will realize that Kathleen Fennessy is ABSOLUTELY CLUELESS.  Fennessy complains about the disheveled nature of the shirts worn by Mr. Clooney in the movie.  What Fennessy FAILS to realize is that the conventional and accepted business attire for businessmen, attorneys, and congressmen at the state and federal levels, is ""aloha shirts.""  Fennessy also fails to understand that aloha shirts are NOT to be tucked in (they are to be worn untucked, just like the Philippine barong shirt is to be worn untucked).",5,An excellent psychological

Such words might be interpreted either as high praise for Alexander or simply a damning comment about the puerile film culture in contemporary America.  Some will find ""The Descendents"" sentimental and soft.  I found it excruciatingly layered.  There were scenes in which one wants to laugh and cry-- and tear one's hair out-- all in the same breath.  The characters are perverse (sometimes in ways which feel contrived and slightly cute).  Yet they all attain a kind of dignity.  Some will find this formulaic.  I found it graceful.If comedy is the highest form of drama,  then what we are witnessing with Alexander Payne is a return to the greatness we used to take for granted in Hollywood.The Coen Brothers are often cited as evidence that a high film culture still exists, and indeed their greatest films (""Fargo,""  ""No Country for Old Men,"") are impressive.  But (with a few notable exceptions (""The Big Lebowski""),  they substitute a high style for a light touch.  The light touch is far harder to achieve, and Payne is working his way towards it.Incidentally, in ""The Descendents,""  Payne does pull off a couple of moments of pure visual poetry, especially when he tracks George Clooney as he stalks the grinning real estate goon with whom Clooney's wife had ""strayed.""

Then you're hit with news you never saw coming and expected to deal with it quietly.Matt King (played by George Clooney) is lawyer in Hawaii and, by virtue of his profession, the sole executor a family trust that controls 25,000 acres of untouched land on Kauai that they will lose relatively soon thanks to the rule against perpetuities. In addition, he is married with two daughters and their mother has been in a coma for six months since a boating accident and the terms of her living will dictate that she will soon be disconnected from life-support. His younger daughter, Scottie (played by Amara Miller), is unaware and is holding out hope that her mother will wake up. His seventeen year-old daughter, Alex (played by Shailene Woodley), is away at a reform school, of sorts, and stills bears a great deal of resentment for her mother as a result of being sent away. She claims the motivation for that decision was her discovery of her mother's infidelity and says as much to her father. First rejecting the idea, Matt (Clooney) eventually accepts it and then decides to confront the other man in her life, bringing his daughters along under the pretense of a much needed respite.Hawaiian music isn't really my taste. Perhaps it's the tone, perhaps it's that I don't speak and could never learn the language. On the other hand, it does set the mood beautifully as do the many shots showcasing Hawaii's natural majesty. Clooney brings the conflict to life with a typically gripping performance and the cast all back him to varying degrees. I will say the part of Brian Speer, the man King (Clooney's) wife was having an affair with was not very well-acted by Matthew Lillard but it's a part with little screen time and few lines so it's forgivable.

1429305,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B004UXUX4Q,Tsuyoshi,"[16, 17]","It is pretty difficult to describe what kind of a film Alexander Payne's new film ""The Descendants"" is. Some will think it is a comedy drama about messy nature of life. Others may feel the film is rather sad, dealing with life's most devastating moment. Perhaps both views are right.The story itself is simple. George Clooney plays Matt King, a successful Hawaiian lawyer and sole trustee of pristine land on Kauai Island. His wife Elizabeth has been in coma since the boating accident a few weeks ago. Having been too busy, he doesn't know how to talk to his two daughters, precocious 10-year-old Scottie (Amara Miller) and rebellious 17-year-old Alex (Shailene Woodley). In his voiceover Matt pleads with his wife to wake up.Ironically it is Matt who has to ""wake up."" He learns that his comatose wife had been ""seeing"" someone. With his wife's health deteriorating, Matt sets out to seek the truths about that guy, with his daughters and Alex's slacker friend Sid (Nick Krause) only to find unexpected consequences. And Matt has to make a grave decision about a tract of land in less than a week.With the beautifully shot on-location photography in Hawaii, ""The Descendants"" sometimes looks like a visual travelogue, but the beautiful images sometime hide uncomfortable surprises and facts Matt didn't want to know. The film is part Matt's spiritual journey that is, skillfully told by the director, is amusing and touching at the same time without relying on conventional settings. It may not be all that uplifting, but overall optimistic.The film is in a sense a character study of Matt (played superbly by George Clooney), but other characters are equally intriguing. While Alex tends to conceal what she really feels (like her father), her sister Scottie takes things as they seem and behaves accordingly. Looking at Matt and his daughters reminds us what we understand least is often someone very close to you.To me, the strength of ""The Descendants"" lies in these characters whose emotions seem often unaccountable (even to those who possess them), but still genuine and realistic nonetheless.

1429307,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B004UXUX4Q,Turfseer,"[4, 9]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***'The Descendants' was directed by Alexander Payne, who also was a co-producer on the recently released 'Cedar Rapids'. Both films fall under the rubric of 'quirky indie dramedy' and director Payne seems to be drawn to this sort of quirky subject matter. While the 'quirkiness' and the 'comedy' are present in 'The Descendants', it's more muted than some of the other films Payne has been involved in.'The Descendants' involves how a family copes after the mother winds up comatose, following a near fatal head injury while water skiing, off the coast of Wakikiki in Hawaii. The husband, Matt King, somewhat mechanically played by George Clooney, is a Honolulu-based attorney who refers to himself as the 'back-up' parent. The first part of 'The Descendants' involves some rather ordinary scenes of Matt attempting to reign in his rebellious daughters (10 year old Scottie bullies a classmate and 17 year old Alex is found drinking when Matt goes to fetch her at the exclusive boarding school she's been staying at).Matt begins his journey of self-discovery when he's forced to make a decision as the head of a large family that owns a large parcel of land on the Hawaiian island of Kuau'i. The family has seven years to dispose of 25,000 acres before the family trust expires. Matt has openly backed the family majority's decision to sell the land to a wealthy developer, over the objections of many of the locals who fear that the pristine land will be spoiled by over development.I'll repeat here my definition of the quirky indie dramedy--it's a film that features a ""quirky protagonist, who must go on a journey of self-discovery, shedding a repressed upbringing with the aid of quirky allies, while thwarting the goals of a reactionary group that wishes to maintain the status quo."" The reactionary group here is the developer and the family members who conspire to sell off their land, to the detriment of the community at large. The quirky protagonist is Matt, who generally resorts to inoffensive, quirky machinations, to achieve his goals. The only real negative note that casts Matt (as well as daughter Alex) in a bad light, is when they refuse to accept the apology of Troy, who was driving the boat, when the mother had her accident. Otherwise, he can be found engaging in such quirky and harmless stratagems, such as mouthing off to his comatose wife in the hospital room or giving a passionate kiss, instead of a peck on the cheek ,to the wife of a man who had an affair with his wife, prior to her devastating injury.When Alex reveals that her mother had an affair with a man, Matt is determined to seek him out. This constitutes the 'second act' of the film and we're curious to see what Matt decides to do. Along the way, Matt gains an unusual quirky ally in the form of Alex's tactless teenage friend, Sid, who ends up being punched in the eye by the comatose woman's father, who holds Matt responsible for his daughter's injury.Through perseverance and outright luck, Matt finally tracks down the man his wife had the affair with; he's Brian Speer, a real estate developer, who Matt finds on Kuau'i, vacationing with his wife and kids. Fortunately there are no violent recriminations as Matt merely gives Brian a tongue lashing and promises to keep the affair secret from his wife (kudos to the screenwriters for keeping things low key and light weight!).Things get wrapped up in 'The Descendants' also on a low key note. Matt simply changes his mind and decides not to sign off on having the family sell the land to the developer. There may have been a taste of revenge on Matt's part, since Brian was set to receive some hefty real estate commissions, had the land been sold to the developer. But Matt makes it clear that it's his love of the land that compels him to go against the majority of the family's wishes.'The Descendants' is very light weight but has its heart in the right place. Not only does Matt get in touch with his altruistic side by keeping the land but also learns to become a better father. The family also is able to 'move on' after the mother is taken off life support. Only the quirky comedy (that's not very funny) gets in the way, epitomized by Julie Speer's rant, at film's end, when she 'loses it', revealing that she's figured it out that husband Brian indeed had been having an affair all along, with Matt's wife.I'm not sure if 'The Descendants' deserves all the awards it's been nominated for, since a main part of the story, Matt's decision to seek out his wife's lover, turns out to be markedly inconsequential. Nonetheless, the film is mildly interesting, especially in light of the protagonist's self-discovery, where the community benefits and a family is made whole.",3,"Light weight, Payne quirky dramedy,

1429313,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B004UXUX4Q,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[26, 40]","In a similar vein to his earlier film Sideways, Alexander Payne's The Descendants is a film about people coping. The difference here is that in this film they are coping with the unacceptable and irresolvable. Based on the novel of the same name by Kaui Hart Hemmings and adapted by Payne, Nat Faxon and Jim Rash, The Descendants deals with the problems of a man discovering that his wife, who is now in a coma from which she will not recover, was unfaithful to him, with all of the ripple effects that something like that can create.Matt King (George Clooney) is a lawyer living on the island of Kaua'i in Hawaii. His wife Elizabeth (Patricia Hastie) is in a hospital where she lies in a coma resulting from a recent boating accident, and now Matt - who refers to himself as ""the back-up parent"" is suddenly thrust into the role of being the only parent to his two daughters, 17-year-old Alex (Shailene Woodley) and 10-year-old Scottie (Amara Miller), both of whom are exhibiting behavioral problems. To make matters worse, Matt is told that his wife is for all intents and purposes brain dead and will not recover and, in accordance with her wishes in her living will, must soon be taken off life support. And if that was not enough pressure to be under, Matt happens to be the sole trustee of a land trust worth hundreds of millions of dollars that he must soon make a decision on regarding its break-up and disposition, a decision of enormous interest to dozens of relatives who stand to benefit enormously from the sale of the land.As Matt begins to let Elizabeth's friends and family know of her impending death, he learns from Alex that Elizabeth was having an affair with another man. Which leaves Matt having to deal with feelings of anger, betrayal, and confusion, with no way to resolve them because the person he needs to resolve them with is in a coma from which she will never recover.Clooney does a deft turn as Matt, making him comical in the situations where he is clearly out of his depth and yet sympathetic as a man having to deal with anger and hurt seeking answers where there may not in fact be any. Shailene Woodley is outstanding, turning in a bravura performance as Alex who is caught in between:  in between her mother and her father when she discovers her mother's affair, in between her mother and her younger sister whom she tries to protect from the truth, in between her father and her boyfriend Sid (Nick Krause) a genial slacker who unfortunately has the habit of saying clueless things that make people want to punch him in the face, and most of all, in between still being a child and being forced to be an adult by the situation they are all now in. Matthew Lillard's Brian Speer, the real estate agent whom Elizabeth was having an affair with, is an interesting casting choice, putting a likeable character actor in an unsympathetic role. Lillard gives Speer just the right touch, a guy who isn't truly villainous, just foolish. Which is part of the problem for Matt. There are no real villains in the situation, no matter how much he and Alex and Elizabeth's blunt bull-headed father (Robert Forster) want there to be. There are only people who make unfortunate choices, the consequences of which are left to others to deal with.The Hawaiian setting is interesting in how it's presented, not showing just the usual idyllic version most people have of Hawaii as an island paradise but the current day side of things where rampant development has made much of it just like anywhere else, visually reinforcing a point Matt makes in the film's opening narration:""My friends think that just because we live in Hawaii, we live in paradise. We're all just out here sipping Mai Tai's, shaking our hips and catching waves. Are they insane? Do they think we're immune to life? How can they possibly think our families are less screwed up? Our heartaches, less painful? Our cancers less deadly? ... Paradise? Paradise can go f[***] itself.""Note: fair warning to parents.

But as is too often the case, he's just figuring out he and his wife have been estranged, when she feels the relationship was over a long time ago.We can't hear Elizabeth's side of the story however because she's been in a boating accident, and is now in a coma. As Matt deals with his guilt over the distance between them, he winds up having to raise his 10 year old daughter alone, and brings his troubled older daughter, Shailene Woodley in a stand out performance, home to help. Tragedy and comedy ensue as the older daughter, Alex, has to quickly become an adult, dealing with the news that her mother is being taken off life support, helping raise her younger sister, and confessing the source of the big fight with her mother. Her mother cheated on her father, and planned to leave him.To this cast of characters, add Elizabeth's bully father, a man who handles his grief by loudly bragging about his daughter's attributes, ignoring her faults, insulting everyone, and even attacking Alex's friend, and her friend, Sid, the guy who reminds you patience is a virtue.Matt becomes immediately obsessed with the other man, wanting to know who he is, where he lives, what he does. What he does is important because Matt is embroiled in a huge real estate deal. His family are heirs to thousands of acres of virgin Hawaiian real estate, and the end of the trust is marking the sale for Matt, who is control of the estate. The other man, Brian Speers, is involved and will make a large commission from the sale.Over the course of the movie, Matt and Alex drive by the man's home, dial his phone, follow him to Oahu and other stalkerish behaviors you can't really blame him for. In between, he becomes reacquainted with his daughters and learns to be a father all over again. At turns, sad and hilarious, Matt and the girls learn how to survive together.Anyone who has lost someone who wasn't perfect (that's all of us) know it's quite possible to be spitting angry at someone who is dying. You feel guilty at the same time. Matt is dealing with a complex hurricane emotions that could sink anyone.Tragically after Matt and Alex catch up to Brian, they find the whole thing was for nothing -- Brian didn't love Elizabeth afterall and had no intention of seeing her in the hospital.  But in a movie that seems to be about loss, Matt realizes, he really can control some things and he really can keep some things together. He decides to hang onto his inheritance, and the relationship with his girls, which you know from the last scene will keep growing.

The acting was good, but the characters were unlikable and unsympathetic, though the youngest daughter got more sympathetic midway through. I thought it a waste of my time and $2 rental price.The story was sappy and contrived.The husband (George Clooney) after living for years in a bad marriage finds out his wife has been cheating on him ~ after she's injured and put in a coma. He then invites his teen daughter along to set out to find the guy (great guidance dad ~ it's your wife you needed long ago to deal with before your daughter's got screwed up.) Anyway, they find him and via that the `other man's' wife learns about the affair.So she comes to the hospital with flowers to meet the `other woman.' A friendly looking gesture, that turns into a one-sided hospital bed confrontation. What? It would be hysterical, except that this was supposed to be a serious scene. The woman then goes into this incredibly nauseating speech about forgiveness, because she has to. As I'm watching, I'm wondering why go after the `other person?' Isn't it your husband (or wife as the case may be) that you should be screaming bloody murder and throwing out on their a__?

Yes, she's dying, you might want to send her off well, but he didn't need to pretend the marriage was something other than what he had been saying all the way through the movie ~ or was it guilt because he didn't let her buy her own boat ~ as his father-in-law repeatedly stated?All in all spend your time on something much more enriching and entertaining.",1,One word A-W-F-U-L!!!,1332028800,"03 18, 2012",2012,1719,"['Descendants', 'overall', '~', 'A-W-F-U-L', '~', 'story-wise', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'characters', 'were', 'unlikable', 'unsympathetic', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'got', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'midway', 'thought', 'waste', 'time', '2', 'rental', 'price.The', 'story', 'was', 'sappy', 'contrived.The', 'husband', 'George', 'Clooney', 'living', 'years', 'bad', 'marriage', 'out', 'wife', 'been', 'cheating', '~', 'injured', 'put', 'coma', 'then', 'teen', 'daughter', 'set', 'out', 'find', 'guy', 'great', 'guidance', 'dad', '~', 'wife', 'needed', 'long', 'ago', 'deal', 'before', 'daughter', 'got', 'screwed', 'up', 'Anyway', 'find', 'other', 'man', 'wife', 'affair.So', 'hospital', 'flowers', 'meet', 'other', 'woman', 'friendly', 'looking', 'gesture', 'one-sided', 'hospital', 'bed', 'confrontation', 'What', 'would', 'be', 'hysterical', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'serious', 'scene', 'woman', 'then', 'incredibly', 'nauseating', 'speech', 'forgiveness', ""'m"", 'watching', ""'m"", 'wondering', 'why', 'go', 'other', 'person', ""n't"", 'husband', 'wife', 'case', 'may', 'be', 'should', 'be', 'screaming', 'bloody', 'murder', 'throwing', 'out', 'a__', 'Clooney', 'character', 'according', 'was', 'very', 'bad', 'marriage', 'what', 'incredibly', 'sappy', 'love', 'speech', 'dying', 'wife', 'Yes', 'dying', 'might', 'want', 'send', 'off', 'well', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'pretend', 'marriage', 'was', 'something', 'other', 'what', 'had', 'been', 'saying', 'way', 'movie', '~', 'was', 'guilt', 'did', ""n't"", 'let', 'buy', 'own', 'boat', '~', 'father-in-law', 'repeatedly', 'stated', 'spend', 'time', 'something', 'much', 'more', 'enriching', 'entertaining']",The Descendants
1429318,AP3B615GM191G,B004UXUX4Q,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[19, 26]","Some films have the intention of creating a lush, emotionally-moving story that works on a number of different levels, but end up failing due to a lack of overall execution.  ""The Descendants"" is exactly that kind of movie.For a basic plot summary, ""The Descendants"" begins with Elizabeth King (Patricia Hastie) in a coma after a severe boating accident.  When husband Matt (George Clooney) learns that she will not be waking up from her coma, he must take his two daughters Alex (Shailene Woodley) & Scottie (Amara Miller) on a trip to inform the relatives.  Along the way, Matt discovers that Elizabeth was cheating on him, and alternatively confronts the man who she had the affair with.The biggest problem with this movie is that it utterly fails to tug at the emotions whatsoever.  We are supposed to become deeply involved with the King family, but instead the character development just falls flat.  It takes a great director to weave everything together, but in this case Alexander Payne just fails to get it done.  All the elements are present...but it just doesn't jell together as it should.It is also strange that, despite the very Hawaiian soundtrack & locale, Hawaii doesn't add anything to this movie.  If a movie is made that heavily features such a locale, it needs to be an integral part of the storyline.  Instead, the Hawaiian flavor doesn't add a thing to this film...only muddying the waters further.Overall, ""The Descendants"" was a big letdown for me considering its Oscar buzz earlier in 2012.  It is miles behind films like ""War House"", ""Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close"", and ""The Help"".  It doesn't even touch Clooney's earlier ""Up in the Air"" effort, which was one of the better films I saw that year.  Unfortunately, this one just falls flat.",2,Never Gets Off The Ground,1334448000,"04 15, 2012",2012,1772,"['films', 'have', 'intention', 'creating', 'lush', 'emotionally-moving', 'story', 'number', 'different', 'levels', 'end', 'up', 'failing', 'due', 'lack', 'overall', 'execution', 'Descendants', 'exactly', 'kind', 'movie.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Descendants', 'Elizabeth', 'King', 'Patricia', 'Hastie', 'coma', 'severe', 'boating', 'accident', 'When', 'husband', 'Matt', 'George', 'Clooney', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'waking', 'up', 'coma', 'must', 'take', 'two', 'daughters', 'Alex', 'Shailene', 'Woodley', 'Scottie', 'Amara', 'Miller', 'trip', 'inform', 'relatives', 'way', 'Matt', 'Elizabeth', 'was', 'cheating', 'alternatively', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'affair', 'with.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'movie', 'utterly', 'tug', 'emotions', 'whatsoever', 'are', 'supposed', 'become', 'deeply', 'involved', 'King', 'family', 'instead', 'character', 'development', 'just', 'flat', 'great', 'director', 'weave', 'everything', 'together', 'case', 'Alexander', 'Payne', 'just', 'get', 'done', 'elements', 'are', 'present', 'just', ""n't"", 'jell', 'together', 'also', 'strange', 'very', 'Hawaiian', 'soundtrack', 'locale', 'Hawaii', ""n't"", 'add', 'anything', 'movie', 'movie', 'made', 'heavily', 'features', 'such', 'locale', 'be', 'integral', 'part', 'storyline', 'Instead', 'Hawaiian', 'flavor', ""n't"", 'add', 'thing', 'film', 'only', 'muddying', 'waters', 'further.Overall', 'Descendants', 'was', 'big', 'letdown', 'considering', 'Oscar', 'buzz', 'earlier', '2012', 'miles', 'films', 'War', 'House', 'Extremely', 'Loud', 'Incredibly', 'Close', 'Help', ""n't"", 'even', 'touch', 'Clooney', 'earlier', 'Air', 'effort', 'was', 'one', 'better', 'films', 'saw', 'year', 'Unfortunately', 'one', 'just', 'flat']",The Descendants
