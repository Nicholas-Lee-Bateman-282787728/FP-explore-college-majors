Yeah, it's great to have the movie in widescreen, but at the very least would it have hurt them to include the trailer?I also think, if the recorded material of Janet Waldo as Judy does indeed exist, an ""alternate audio cut"" should've been made available as a bonus feature.

266364,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,6301795148,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[2, 3]","Jetsons: The Movie is like a long episode of the show - but with music.  It's a fun enough ride, but it never takes on the feel of an actual movie.  With its diverse set of characters and intergalactic creatures, it's an interesting enough story.  Judged solely as a movie, though, it comes up short (and not only in terms of its running time of 82 minutes, 7 of which are the end credits).  The film just never really managed to distinguish itself from old episodes of the show, making you wonder why they bothered to make a movie in the first place.After all these years, George Jetson's button-pushing prowess has finally been recognized.  Mr. Spaceley makes George a vice president and ships him off to run an orbiting sprocket production facility.  Mr. Spaceley really wants this facility up and running because cheap production costs mean higher profits, and the automated plant requires only two employees - a robot to keep everything up and working, and a vice president to push the start button every morning.  What George doesn't know is that four vice presidents have already come and gone, as the plant has continually run into major problems.  The kids aren't too wild about moving (Elroy has his basketball tournament coming up and Judy has fallen in love with a rock star), but the Jetsons soon settle in among their multi-species neighbors on the asteroid.  As they learn to adjust and make new friends, George finds his dream job cursed with major glitches.  Someone or something is sabotaging the machinery, and it's up to George to figure out what is really going on.I don't expect to see a lot of musical numbers when I watch The Jetsons, but this movie has more than its fair share of just that very thing, including what can only be called an abstract music video at one point.  I think a lot of viewers will not embrace the music very much at all.  There are actually two rap songs in here, and I just have to say there's no reason in the world George Jetson needs to start rapping about anything.  You also have three songs by Tiffany - now, I've always been a Tiffany fan, but I daresay that puts me in a definite minority.  Tiffany not only sings, though; she also serves as the voice of young Judy Jetson.  She's not half bad, but of course most of her dialogue consists mainly of futuristic teen slang.Basically, I'm going right down the middle on this one and labeling the movie perfectly average.  Kids will enjoy it, but I fear many a parent over the ensuing years has cringed every time one of their brood popped this thing back into the VCR for another viewing.",3,Feels more like a long TV episode than an actual movie,1144108800,"04 4, 2006",2006,2594,"['Jetsons', 'Movie', 'long', 'episode', 'show', 'music', 'fun', 'enough', 'ride', 'never', 'feel', 'actual', 'movie', 'diverse', 'set', 'characters', 'intergalactic', 'creatures', 'interesting', 'enough', 'story', 'Judged', 'solely', 'movie', 'though', 'up', 'short', 'not', 'only', 'terms', 'running', 'time', '82', 'minutes', '7', 'are', 'end', 'credits', 'film', 'just', 'never', 'really', 'managed', 'distinguish', 'old', 'episodes', 'show', 'making', 'wonder', 'why', 'bothered', 'make', 'movie', 'first', 'place.After', 'years', 'George', 'Jetson', 'button-pushing', 'prowess', 'finally', 'been', 'recognized', 'Mr.', 'Spaceley', 'George', 'vice', 'president', 'ships', 'off', 'run', 'orbiting', 'sprocket', 'production', 'facility', 'Mr.', 'Spaceley', 'really', 'facility', 'up', 'running', 'because', 'cheap', 'production', 'costs', 'mean', 'higher', 'profits', 'automated', 'plant', 'only', 'two', 'employees', 'robot', 'keep', 'everything', 'up', 'working', 'vice', 'president', 'push', 'start', 'button', 'morning', 'What', 'George', ""n't"", 'know', 'four', 'vice', 'presidents', 'have', 'already', 'come', 'gone', 'plant', 'continually', 'run', 'major', 'problems', 'kids', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'wild', 'moving', 'Elroy', 'basketball', 'tournament', 'coming', 'up', 'Judy', 'fallen', 'love', 'rock', 'star', 'Jetsons', 'soon', 'settle', 'multi-species', 'neighbors', 'asteroid', 'learn', 'adjust', 'make', 'new', 'friends', 'George', 'dream', 'job', 'cursed', 'major', 'glitches', 'Someone', 'something', 'sabotaging', 'machinery', 'up', 'George', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'see', 'lot', 'musical', 'numbers', 'when', 'watch', 'Jetsons', 'movie', 'more', 'fair', 'share', 'just', 'very', 'thing', 'including', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'called', 'abstract', 'music', 'video', 'one', 'point', 'think', 'lot', 'viewers', 'will', 'not', 'embrace', 'music', 'very', 'much', 'are', 'actually', 'two', 'rap', 'songs', 'here', 'just', 'have', 'say', 'reason', 'world', 'George', 'Jetson', 'start', 'rapping', 'anything', 'also', 'have', 'three', 'songs', 'Tiffany', 'now', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'Tiffany', 'fan', 'daresay', 'definite', 'minority', 'Tiffany', 'not', 'only', 'sings', 'also', 'voice', 'young', 'Judy', 'Jetson', 'not', 'half', 'bad', 'course', 'most', 'dialogue', 'mainly', 'futuristic', 'teen', 'slang.Basically', ""'m"", 'going', 'right', 'middle', 'one', 'labeling', 'movie', 'perfectly', 'average', 'Kids', 'will', 'enjoy', 'fear', 'many', 'parent', 'ensuing', 'years', 'cringed', 'time', 'one', 'brood', 'popped', 'thing', 'back', 'VCR', 'viewing']",N/A

I don't think enough people knew or cared about this to affect ticket sales anyways.

It wouldn't be hard to do, but movies like this rarely get much love on DVD.

Jetsons: The Movie is an homage to the Star Trek episode 'Devil in the Dark'. George Jetson and his family are sent to a remote Spacely Mining colony to find out who or what is sabotaging Spacely's factory. It's a fact that series regular Janet Waldo provided the voice for Judy Jetson. However, it was replaced with the voice of pop singer Tiffany. I guess the producers hoped that Tiffany's fans would flock to see the movie. A few Tiffany songs were tacked onto the film.By 1990, heavy metal and rap had eclipsed Tiffany's music in popularity.George O' Hanlon(the voice of George Jetson) was in ill health and struggled to finish his work on the movie. Mel Blanc(Mr. Spacely) also died during the making of the film. John Debney wrote a lush, epic music score for the film and he adapts Hoyt Curtin's Jetsons theme song. The film blends 2D animation with decent, 1990's style CGI. The film is also flavored with some rap music as it was trendy at the time.

I have to say, with all the stupid garbage animated movies coming out lately or good movies that turn out to be scandals (cough cough thelionking), its nice to see an old school animated film. And what better way to enjoy a calssic animated film than with the Jetsons. I enjoyed the use of synth 90's music with orchestra for the music score. It helped bring out the futuristic atmosphere of the film. I also enjoyed the CG animation blend with 2D animation. I thought it made the film look very modern and still keep the classic look to it. My only beef was that at times it seemed like one musiscal sequence after another. Of course this was back when EVERY animated movie was a musical. Although the characters never just randomly broke out into song, there were still musical sequences. They were quite creative though. I especially liked the song when the Jetsons were on their way to their new home. I also noticed that the pop singer Tiffany took the role of Judy Jetson. I understand that she wasn't exactly going for an Oscar worthy performance, but she's a much better singer than an actress. I admit though, it's not perfect. The message the movie sends is a little too strong and the cuteness level is way too high.

JETSONS:  THE MOVIE follows in this fine and funny tradition and gives a nice environmentally friendly lesson as well.  All the main characters from the series are here including nice working guy George, his pretty wife Jane, typical teenage daughter Judy, cute son Elroy, bossy robot maid Rosie, greedy boss Mr. Spaceley and loyal but slobbering dog Astro who foreshadowed Scooby Doo by starting almost every word with the r sound.  Some cute aliens are introduced in the movie that liberally borrow traits from both the Smurfs and the Ewoks.  The soundtrack is pure early 90s teen music (teen icon of the late 80's ""Tiffany"" voices daughter Judy) which is not a favorite style of mine but this is a decent representation.  Kids and younger adults who have never seen the original show will like this movie for its humorous moments, lovable characters and creative ""future"" view.

This time when I watched it though, I was surprised to see it drag in several places.  George goes through the same comic routine of getting caught in the sprocket machine several times, and it takes forever for someone to come up with an idea of staying in the plant after working hours to figure out what's causing all the trouble.Then again, the film has some definite highlights.  It's fun seeing the wonders of the Jetsons' new home, and most of the songs are surprisingly good, except for the one or two awful rap songs.  Rap was EVERYWHERE at this time.  Most embarassing thing of the 90's if you ask me.The movie starts getting a little environmentally preachy near the end, without much comic relief to lighten it up and make it easy to swallow.Good for a rental if you have kids I guess, but the TV show had to be a lot better.",3,Some Good and Some Blah,1154995200,"08 8, 2006",2006,958,"['was', 'so', 'excited', 'when', 'found', 'old', 'movie', 'shelf', 'remember', 'liking', 'lot', 'back', 'day', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'time', 'when', 'watched', 'was', 'surprised', 'see', 'drag', 'several', 'places', 'George', 'same', 'comic', 'routine', 'getting', 'caught', 'sprocket', 'machine', 'several', 'times', 'forever', 'someone', 'come', 'up', 'idea', 'staying', 'plant', 'working', 'hours', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'causing', 'trouble.Then', 'again', 'film', 'definite', 'highlights', 'fun', 'seeing', 'wonders', 'Jetsons', 'new', 'home', 'most', 'songs', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'one', 'two', 'awful', 'rap', 'songs', 'Rap', 'was', 'EVERYWHERE', 'time', 'Most', 'embarassing', 'thing', '90', 'ask', 'me.The', 'movie', 'getting', 'little', 'environmentally', 'preachy', 'end', 'much', 'comic', 'relief', 'lighten', 'up', 'make', 'easy', 'swallow.Good', 'rental', 'have', 'kids', 'guess', 'TV', 'show', 'had', 'be', 'lot', 'better']",N/A

The Jetsons are without a doubt, one of the most beloved television familes that have ever graced the small screen. Like the Simpsons, they are one of the very few to have graced the big screen in full animated glory.This movie is a very meaningful one for many reasons. It was the final performances of George O'Hannlon (George Jetson) and Mel Blanc (Mr. Spacely and a great deal of additional cartoon characters) Unfortunatly these gifted men lost their lives in the middle of the filming and you can definitely hear it in the voice of George in bit parts. This was also one of the first animated films to use a very primitive 3-D computer animation. Unfortunatly, I only got to see this movie when it was put on video so I cannot wait to try it out on my 42 inch plasma! It was also a movie that really kept the true elements of the Jetsons show intact with just a few new spins. Some examples would the new home, the music videos of songs done perfectly by Tiffany and also messages about perserving the environment which was just starting to become a topic of major concern in the late 1980's early 1990'sThe Jetsons The Movie is one of my all time favorites and it is classic in my eyes. It is non stop fun with a little of everything. This true space age family is one of the few that should be preserved for many generations to come to let them know that back then TV family was a true treasure to behold.Now that I finally have the movie in my hands I will say this.
