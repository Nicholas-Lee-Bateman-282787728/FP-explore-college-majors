898950,A3TJJHMWV3SFNI,B0008FPJK8,"Brett Heitkam ""DVD obsessed""","[2, 2]","Degrassi: The Next Generation is a school-centered soap opera aimed at both teens and adults.  It is a spinoff of the 80s TV show Degrassi Junior High and features a new group of students at Degrassi Community School as well as many characters from the original series that are now grown up and facing issues and problems of their own.There are so many things that make this show a success.  The cast is picture perfect.  This is not the type of series that casts 25-year-olds to play someone in 9th grade.  The team behind Degrassi goes for realism all the way.  Because a they have a 14-year-old actor play a 14-year-old character, it packs a more dramatic punch when we see the sometimes very troublesome situations the characters get themselves in.  This isn't a hilarious teen comedy show like Saved By the Bell.  The characters are all three-dimensional and you won't find any stereotypes.  The cast of young actors represents a true cross-section of the sort of kids you would see in real life.As far as the storylines go, the superb first season dealt with many issues, such as teen drinking, internet stalkers, final exam stress, and in the season finale, the show became darker as one of the main characters, Ashley, overdosed on Ecstasy at a party.Here, in the second season, the stories get even darker.  Ashley spends the majority of this season dealing with how her behavior in the season one finale ruined her social life.  Paige, the snobby rich girl with a heart of gold, learns the hard way that to some guys ""no"" doesn't always mean ""no.""  Marco, a new character introduced this season, must deal with his sexuality.  As for the adults, Emma's mother, Christine, decides to marry her boyfriend, science teacher Archie Simpson.  On the eve of her wedding, she finds out she is pregnant.  Archie has specifically told her he doesn't want kids so she freaks out...what should she do?  Joey Jeremiah deals with his dead wife's son Craig after it is revealed that Craig's father has been SEVERELY beating him (in one of Degrassi's most painful-to-watch scenes ever).  There are many more interesting stories weaving throughout this season and it never lets up.  This is definitely indicative of the even greater stories to come in the later seasons!On to the DVDs themselves.  Degrassi: The Next Generation is filmed in widescreen, but for some reason, the powers-that-be have decided to release the show on DVD in fullscreen pan and scan.  This is disappointing, because Degrassi is a bigger-budgeted show and every episode has a movie-like quality to it.  The cropping of the picture is obvious and to have the episodes as they were originally shot would be nice.  Otherwise, the picture quality is perfect, at least as good as originally broadcast.There are three discs of episodes and then a fourth disc with a TON of special features.  SuperFans of Degrassi (you know who you are) will eat this stuff up.  There are over 130 deleted scenes, audition tapes, and much more.All in all, Degrassi: The Next Generation is a wonderful series that anyone can enjoy.  Even though there's the whole annoying no-widescreen issue, this is definitely a solid DVD set.  Definitely buy this and the rest of the series! You won't be disappointed!",5,Degrassi Season 2......Enjoy!,1187395200,"08 18, 2007",2007,3249,"['Degrassi', 'Next', 'Generation', 'school-centered', 'soap', 'opera', 'aimed', 'teens', 'adults', 'spinoff', '80s', 'TV', 'show', 'Degrassi', 'Junior', 'High', 'new', 'group', 'students', 'Degrassi', 'Community', 'School', 'as', 'well', 'many', 'characters', 'original', 'series', 'are', 'now', 'grown', 'up', 'facing', 'issues', 'problems', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'make', 'show', 'success', 'cast', 'picture', 'perfect', 'not', 'type', 'series', '25-year-olds', 'play', 'someone', '9th', 'grade', 'team', 'Degrassi', 'realism', 'way', 'have', '14-year-old', 'actor', 'play', '14-year-old', 'character', 'more', 'dramatic', 'punch', 'when', 'see', 'sometimes', 'very', 'troublesome', 'situations', 'characters', 'get', ""n't"", 'hilarious', 'teen', 'comedy', 'show', 'Saved', 'Bell', 'characters', 'are', 'three-dimensional', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'stereotypes', 'cast', 'young', 'actors', 'true', 'cross-section', 'sort', 'kids', 'would', 'see', 'real', 'life.As', 'far', 'storylines', 'go', 'superb', 'first', 'season', 'dealt', 'many', 'issues', 'such', 'teen', 'drinking', 'internet', 'stalkers', 'final', 'exam', 'stress', 'season', 'finale', 'show', 'became', 'darker', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'Ashley', 'overdosed', 'Ecstasy', 'party.Here', 'second', 'season', 'stories', 'get', 'even', 'darker', 'Ashley', 'majority', 'season', 'dealing', 'how', 'behavior', 'season', 'one', 'finale', 'ruined', 'social', 'life', 'Paige', 'snobby', 'rich', 'girl', 'heart', 'gold', 'hard', 'way', 'guys', ""n't"", 'always', 'mean', 'Marco', 'new', 'character', 'introduced', 'season', 'must', 'deal', 'sexuality', 'adults', 'Emma', 'mother', 'Christine', 'marry', 'boyfriend', 'science', 'teacher', 'Archie', 'Simpson', 'eve', 'wedding', 'pregnant', 'Archie', 'specifically', 'told', ""n't"", 'want', 'kids', 'out', 'what', 'should', 'do', 'Joey', 'Jeremiah', 'deals', 'dead', 'wife', 'son', 'Craig', 'revealed', 'Craig', 'father', 'been', 'SEVERELY', 'beating', 'one', 'Degrassi', 'most', 'painful-to-watch', 'scenes', 'ever', 'are', 'many', 'more', 'interesting', 'stories', 'weaving', 'season', 'never', 'up', 'definitely', 'indicative', 'even', 'greater', 'stories', 'come', 'later', 'seasons', 'DVDs', 'Degrassi', 'Next', 'Generation', 'filmed', 'widescreen', 'reason', 'powers-that-be', 'have', 'decided', 'release', 'show', 'DVD', 'fullscreen', 'pan', 'scan', 'disappointing', 'Degrassi', 'bigger-budgeted', 'show', 'episode', 'movie-like', 'quality', 'cropping', 'picture', 'obvious', 'have', 'episodes', 'were', 'originally', 'shot', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'Otherwise', 'picture', 'quality', 'perfect', 'least', 'as', 'good', 'originally', 'are', 'three', 'discs', 'episodes', 'then', 'fourth', 'disc', 'TON', 'special', 'features', 'SuperFans', 'Degrassi', 'know', 'who', 'are', 'will', 'eat', 'stuff', 'up', 'are', '130', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'audition', 'tapes', 'much', 'more.All', 'Degrassi', 'Next', 'Generation', 'wonderful', 'series', 'anyone', 'can', 'enjoy', 'Even', 'whole', 'annoying', 'no-widescreen', 'issue', 'definitely', 'solid', 'DVD', 'set', 'Definitely', 'buy', 'rest', 'series', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed']","Degrassi: The Next Generation, Season 2"

898953,A1L0W5MGW0TKWV,B0008FPJK8,"C. Logan ""Missy""","[0, 0]","The second season of Degrassi: The Next Generation separates itself from the first by covering more grown up storylines, introducing interesting new characters, and taking the show to a new level overall. This season, half of the cast enters their freshmen year of high school, and a range of high school issues come to light.The season immediately starts off with an extremely difficult topic--child abuse. And we get an introduction to a great new character, Craig Manning, who get to see deal with the issue first hand. Craig is the new kid at Degrassi. Aside from being a mysterious loner, he has a dark side that he hides from the people around him. His dad abuses him. And this isn't the only extreme issue dealt with this season. We get our first closeted gay character, Marco Delrossi, whose coming out process is displayed wonderfully on screen. Another new character is Ellie Nash, a feisty punk rocker with an independent attitude.The new characters add a lot to season two, but the characters we grew to know and love in season one go through a lot this season as well. And the range of issues they go through are more grown up as well. Some of these issues include rape, an eating disorder, and underaged drinking. We also see some common issues that most teens face on a day to day basis; dating, homework or just fitting in with the right crowd. These are all important parts of high school, and we all know it because we've all been there.Degrassi continues to address major milestones that teenagers face everyday, while also giving us a bit of light hearted humor to go with it. The show never fails to present its characters and their issues in an honest, frank manner that fans of the show will relate to. This season shows more of a mature side to the characters we got to know in season one, as well as some new ones. If you enjoyed season one, I recommend buying season two to watch your favorite characters continue to grow and develop and face all the problems that come along with being a teenager.",4,Degrassi Grows Up,1216857600,"07 24, 2008",2008,2024,"['second', 'season', 'Degrassi', 'Next', 'Generation', 'first', 'covering', 'more', 'grown', 'up', 'storylines', 'introducing', 'interesting', 'new', 'characters', 'taking', 'show', 'new', 'level', 'overall', 'season', 'half', 'cast', 'enters', 'freshmen', 'year', 'high', 'school', 'range', 'high', 'school', 'issues', 'come', 'light.The', 'season', 'immediately', 'off', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'topic', 'child', 'abuse', 'get', 'introduction', 'great', 'new', 'character', 'Craig', 'Manning', 'who', 'get', 'see', 'deal', 'issue', 'first', 'hand', 'Craig', 'new', 'kid', 'Degrassi', 'Aside', 'being', 'mysterious', 'loner', 'dark', 'side', 'people', 'dad', ""n't"", 'only', 'extreme', 'issue', 'dealt', 'season', 'get', 'first', 'closeted', 'gay', 'character', 'Marco', 'Delrossi', 'coming', 'out', 'process', 'displayed', 'wonderfully', 'screen', 'new', 'character', 'Ellie', 'Nash', 'feisty', 'punk', 'rocker', 'independent', 'attitude.The', 'new', 'characters', 'add', 'lot', 'season', 'two', 'characters', 'grew', 'know', 'love', 'season', 'one', 'go', 'lot', 'season', 'as', 'well', 'range', 'issues', 'go', 'are', 'more', 'grown', 'up', 'as', 'well', 'issues', 'include', 'rape', 'eating', 'disorder', 'underaged', 'drinking', 'also', 'see', 'common', 'issues', 'most', 'teens', 'face', 'day', 'day', 'basis', 'dating', 'homework', 'just', 'fitting', 'right', 'crowd', 'are', 'important', 'parts', 'high', 'school', 'know', ""'ve"", 'been', 'there.Degrassi', 'address', 'major', 'milestones', 'teenagers', 'face', 'everyday', 'also', 'giving', 'bit', 'light', 'hearted', 'humor', 'go', 'show', 'never', 'present', 'characters', 'issues', 'honest', 'frank', 'manner', 'fans', 'show', 'will', 'relate', 'season', 'more', 'mature', 'side', 'characters', 'got', 'know', 'season', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'new', 'ones', 'enjoyed', 'season', 'one', 'recommend', 'buying', 'season', 'two', 'watch', 'favorite', 'characters', 'continue', 'grow', 'develop', 'face', 'problems', 'come', 'along', 'being', 'teenager']","Degrassi: The Next Generation, Season 2"

The action intensified during the second season. New characters were introduced. Craig Manning was the first new character introduced in a major way during season 2. Craig's father was extremely abusive. Craig is the half brother to Joey Jeremiah's daughter Angela. Joey eventually takes Craig under his roof. Craig had a lot of storylines during season 2. Two new characters who were introduced that had connected stories were Ellie and Marco. Ellie is a different girl. She isn't quite as Goth as Ashley becomes but she has piercings and a very unique look. Marco questions his sexuality. He and Ellie form a close bond during season 2.The most disturbing storyline of season 2 might be the date rape young Paige experiences. She was not a favorite with fans always because of her attitude, but her rape brought sympathy to her character. Paige also had to deal with the after burden of the rape when her attacker comes to Degrassi for a sports event.Little Emma is still cute and sweet during season two and her best friend Manny is still a bit innocent, although she does have a major crush on Craig. During season 2, Craig and Manny don't get very far in their relationship. Emma's mother Spike marries her teacher Archie, Mr. Simpson. The wedding brings back several cast members from Degrassi Junior High as Caitlin and Lucy show up to offer Spike support on her big day.Ashley deals with esteem issues. She feels like she needs to be a certain way to be friends with Ellie. Ellie explains to her that she doesn't have to get a piercing just to be her friend. Ashley also isn't sure if she wants to stay Goth or go back to her old look. When her and Jimmy reunite, it takes performing in a school play with Craig for her to realize what she really wants to do.Overall, Season 2 was quite enjoyable.

898958,A9YA983MXKCEL,B0008FPJK8,"Gregory Bartz ""Gregorius""","[16, 92]","(note: the following comments apply to all seasons)This is a really awful show. I mean, it's not as bad as most of the crap on Noggin, but it's still pretty awful. Which is sad really, because the writers do try to make it a good show in their own eyes. And, apparently, the eyes of any 12-year-olds who are dumb enough to believe this crap, which is nothing more than propaganda cheaply disguised as drama, encouraging kids to eat all their veggies and stay virgins for their whole lives.Okay, enough trash-talking. It's time for me to explain WHY this show is so awful. Sadly, it's not one big simple thing. It's a whole bunch of big simple things. I'll start with the one that bugs me the most: unforgivably inaccurate representations of every single ""issue"" (translation: newspaper headline) that the show ""deals with"" (translation: poorly uses as a plot device). For example, take the Season 1 finale ""Jagged Little Pill"". In this episode, a character named Ashley (the only tolerable one in the bunch) takes one hit of Ecstasy and starts speaking gibberish, losing motor control, and doing a few other things. The problem here is that Ecstasy doesn't do ANY of the things that happen to Ash in this episode! Ash then spends the entire summer in Rehab, which no one in the real world goes to unless they're ADDICTED to something. Example number two: a character named Toby, downcast about being circa 50 pounds overweight, forgoes solid food. He lasts about 2 or 3 days at the most before fainting. Sorry, but in the real world, you'd have to get to well below 100 pounds and stay there for a while before you pass out from a lack of calories. In this same episode, a girl who must weigh at least 200 pounds gets a job as a plus-size model and lays the smackdown on a fast food clerk who mocks her physical condition. What's the moral of the story here? That it's okay to be morbidly obese?Alright, second problem. The characters are all horribly one-dimensional stereotypes who lack the brainpower that God gave a jellyfish. Whenever a character is placed in a situation that involves any kind of decision-making, they can always be counted on to take the stupidest, most irrational course of action that the writers can get away with. Said characters are as follows: the Big Dumb Immature Jock (Spinner), the Glamour Queen With Minions (Paige), the Class Clown (JT? or is it TJ?), the Clueless Crusader (Emma), the Token Angry Black Guy (Jimmy), the Token Fruitcake (Marco), the Bad Boy From a Broken Family (Sean), two Smart People With Glasses Who Are Horribly Out Of Shape (Liberty and Toby), and two people (Ashley and Craig) who almost resemble real, normal people. There's also Manny, who originally had the personality of a toaster and was only on the show to give Emma someone to talk to other than her computer; later, the writers decided to make her the official Tramp Wannabe. Every single one of these characters has been seen on at least a dozen sitcoms before, and almost as many real-world high schools.Problem number three. Everyone gets busted. Always. For everything. This makes the plots EXTREMELY predictable, and predictable plots are never a good thing. Jimmy takes Spinner's Ritalin prior to a basketball game? Gee, he got kicked off the team, what a shock! Craig cheats on Ash with Manny? Oh, I'm sure Ash will NEVER find out... so boring. It's counterproductive, too: the characters never regret their actions out of guilt, only out of punishment. What's the lesson? It's only wrong because you got busted?Fourth problem. Lack of realism and balance. For example, the two smartest kids in the school, as previously mentioned, both wear glasses and are horribly out of shape. Smart people in the real world are just as physically fit and can see just as well as the rest of us. Also, I've noticed that the ONLY time the characters ever have sex is in the context of cheating. Nobody ever has sex with the person they're actually dating. Why? Because God forbid that anyone who watches this show get the impression that losing your virginity in High School won't totally ruin your life.Anyway... I have a million and one other gripes with this show, but I think I've said enough. I will admit that this show is EXTREMELY addictive, even for someone who hates it as much as I do, and it's a bit better than the likes of Boy Meets World or Beverly Hills 90210. And I do kind of have to respect what the writers are trying to do with all the Aesop's Fables B.S. But really, if you want a quasi-realistic High School drama, watch Boston Public, or at least Freaks and Geeks (a very overrated show IMO). But for the love of all that is good and holy, if you don't want your brain turned into grape pudding, then stay away from Degrassi.",1,"Like crack: addictive, but rots your brain",1127779200,"09 27,

If not for watching the second season while watching the first season, I would've never given this show this much attention regardless of how big of a Drake fan I am. The second season made this show a lot better. It had an edgy appeal towards the end of the first season with the ecstasy episode, but this was the season when I started seeing this show wasn't going to be your typical high school show (not that there's anything wrong with that). ""When Doves Cry"" with Craig's creepy father being abusive was the very first episode so I couldn't help but be ready for anything after that. Craig complimented the cast. I like how he made his way into the school, and I thought he was a better fit for Ashley than Jimmy. I never quite believed those two together. I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen Season 3, but the detention episode was the one where I got to see Jimmy with who seemed to fit more with. Liberty's crush on J.T. is too cute to me, and in Season 3 when she developed another crush, that was hilarious, too. Emma is still being a busybody and getting on my nerves, but I thought Sean may have helped her gain a few cool points. Sorta.Manny's character was the most interesting (and scandalous) for the season, and this is one of the reasons I like how this show is going. I would've never cast her as the character that she is because physically she's so perky and pretty, but whoa, this girl can act. She put soap operas like ""Dynasty"" to shame because she was ruthless when it came to Craig. I have to give the lady behind Manny's character all kinds of kudos for her acting chops.There were also some darker episodes with Paige and an athlete and Hazel's insecurities about her background that made me enjoy the show more. I like that they're taking on topics that usually don't get picked up. The one with Paige is something I've seen sparingly, but the one with Hazel was absolutely relevant and appreciated for today's generation especially because of a certain huge and current incident in our history within the past decade. (I won't spoil it for everyone but ""Don't Believe the Hype"" was a good episode.) ""Careless Whisper"" with Marco exploring his sexuality was another topic that I thought was necessary for today's generation. I just like this show. It's edgy. It's funny. It's believable.

I remember years ago hearing about Degrassi this and Degrassi that, all of it concerning ""The Next Generation"" cast of kids.  Little did I know that I was missing out on a terrific show that is so much more than pretty faces trying to pull off a soap opera.  This show puts to sleep all those fake shows and opens our eyes to pretty much the real deal of current times that kids face in public junior high & high schools.  Characters like Ellie and Craig (portrayed beautifully by Stacey Farber & Jake Epstein) show controversial situations that kids sometimes face and deal with on their own.  There are issues that arise in the show that are all too hauntingly common with the real deal.  Canada really has a brilliant show in their grasp and it is one I will stick with, as long as the dvds keep on coming out.  The dvds offer everything a Degrassi fan could hope for.

Ashley Kerwin's character has the biggest transformation then anyone from the original cast.  Gone is the Mandy Moore clone Ashley and in her place is an Emo looking more introspective Ashley.  Another interesting aspect of Season Two is the introduction of Craig Manning into the series.  Craig's character deals with physical abuse from his father which is dealt with in the first two episodes of the seasons and the last two.  Craig's interaction with Manny Santos and Ashley Kerwin are foreshadowing his relationship with them both in future seasons.  Season Two also deals with touchy subjects like teen drinking, eating disorders, racism, self-image, abortion, rape, sexual identity, and death.  This season also continues two of Degrassi great love affairs.  Liberty Van Zandt & J.T. Yorke.  Sean Cameron & Emma Nielson.
