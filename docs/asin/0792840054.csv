144761,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,0792840054,Acute Observer,"[3, 5]","It is night along the coast. Shots are heard, a man falls to the floor. A car drives away. A woman stands on a pier until a policeman talks to her. Then a man meets her and offers a free drink. They talk about the past, then return to the beach house. Wally's talk tells about his character. Wally finds a man's body, Mildred has left. The police arrive to find Wally leaving the house. When Mildred returns home she finds the police waiting to take her in for questioning about the dead man. A detective takes all the pieces about a murder, puts them together, finds out the motive for the murder, then arrests a suspect. [No scientific investigation at all? Not even a paraffin test? When they find the first likely suspect the investigation ends. But better investigatory techniques are coming from advances in criminalistics.]The film shows Mildred's past life with her first husband Burt Pierce. He is out of work. Mildred is devoted to her two daughters. Her married life breaks up over their difficulties. Burt's friend Wally comes over and invites himself in. Would Wally pull a cheap trick? Mildred's oldest daughter has expensive tastes. [Where did that come from?] Mildred learns it is hard to get a job without experience. But she finds a job as a waitress and does real good. At home she baked pies for the restaurant. Daughter Veda is a spoiled rotten snob. Mildred hopes to open her own restaurant, and finds a suitable property. Her business plan convinces Mr. Beragon to sell the house.Mildred works hard to make her restaurant a success. She applies for a liquor license. Her life seems to be improving. Beragon is a wealthy heir who has an empty life. Then her youngest daughter catches pneumonia, a fatal disease before antibiotics. Mildred's hard work and management made her restaurant a big success, with other locations. The story now jumps to the murder investigation. The police have learned more about Mildred's activities that night. Wally Faye warned Mildred about Beragon - he is a parasite. Veda has been borrowing money from Mildred's employees. The character of Monte Beragon is revealed by his actions.Mrs. Forester, Ted's mother, objects to Veda's romance with Ted. Veda has married Ted! But now Veda wants to end this marriage - for $10,000. Mildred learns about the horrible character of Veda and throws her out of her house. Mildred takes a vacation in Mexico [no reason given]. Mildred finds out that Veda is a singer at Wally Faye's bar; she has a new life. Monte Beragon is down to selling off the family mansion. [Is this a comment on his character?] Monte will make a deal for a marriage to Mildred. Will Mildred do anything for Veda? Soon Mildred's creditors are demanding payment, and she finds out how she was betrayed. [No surprise here?] The ending has a shocking surprise that follows logically from the actions viewed previously.There are morals to this story. Beware of the wealthy and their bad habits. Do not neglect your family so they get into trouble. The most important is to know when to cut your losses and avoid bad choices. Mildred should not have ripped up that $10,000 check, or gotten involved with sleazy Monte Beragon.

144762,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,0792840054,Alex Udvary,"[0, 0]","Before watching ""Mildred Pierce"" I knew almost nothing about it. All I knew was that it was a story about the relationship between a mother and daugther and that Joan Crawford won the Academy Award for her performance. As the credits rolled and I read the name James M.Cain I knew I was in for a surprise. At that point I figured out this was going to be a noir film. ""Mildred Pierce"" impressed me so much that I consider it one of the all-time great noir films.As I watched the film I started thinking about the Lana Turner\Tony Stompanato scandal. If you remember Turner's daughter said she shot Stompanato in self-defense. I thought perhaps the film was based on that incident. But thank goodness for the internet I was able to research the Lana Turner story and found out it happened in 1958. ""Mildred Pierce"" was made in 1945. So there went my theory. I guess what ""Mildred Pierce"" could be described as is a case of life imatating art. You have to admit, there are connections.""Mildred Pierce"" is kind of hard to describe. I'm afraid, if I haven't already, I'll reveal too much. But considering the fact the movie is considered a classic, many may already know the story. I'm not sure how much I should tell you. Maybe it's best I don't.It's odd for to to think that before this movie Joan Crawford was never even nominated for an Oscar. I'm not sure ""Pierce"" is really her best performance. Back in the 1930s when she was working for MGM Crawford made some truly amazing films. The movies dealth with taboo subjects. Think of her performance in ""Paid"" about a ""working girl"" who studies the law and actually outwits the police. After the production code set in you may have noticed one of the themes of most films was ""crime doesn't pay"". Here Crawford is showing maybe it does. Or what about ""Laughing Sinners"" (Clark Gable co-stars) that too dealt with touchy subjects. It's a shame to think Crawford's work had gone unappreciated by the Academy. But, isn't that the way it always goes. Actors and actress give one great performance after another and never win an award and when they finally do win it's for a ""lesser"" performance. I mean, do you mean to tell me ""Scent of A Woman"" is really Al Pacino's best performance? Crawford is good in ""Pierce"" don't get me wrong, but, I don't think it should have been the only performance she ever won for.""Mildred Pierce"" does such a great job creating a noir mood. Pay attention to the use of shadows and lighting. Look at the scene near the end with Pierce, Veda (Ann Blyth) and Monte (Zachary Scott) all in the basement. Notice how Crawford walks for out of the darkness (literally and metaphorically) to find out the truth about her daughter and Monte. Also pay attention to Crawford's shoulders. The more money and power she gets the broader her shoulders are made to look. Giving her an almost masculine look.""Mildred Pierce"" was nominated for 6 Oscars  including ""Best Picture"" (It lost that year to Billy Wilder's ""The Lost Weekend"") and Ann Blyth and Eva Arden were both up for ""best supporting actress"" as was the film's screenplay. Oddly though the movie's director Michael Curtiz (""Casablanca"") was not nominated. I wonder why?Bottom-line: One of the best noir films I've seen. A movie that leaves a lasting impression on the viewer. While I don't think it's Crawford's best performance, it is effective nonetheless.",4,"Movie Has  A ""Piercing"" Effect On The Viewer",1114819200,"04 30, 2005",2005,3380,"['watching', 'Mildred', 'Pierce', 'knew', 'almost', 'nothing', 'knew', 'was', 'was', 'story', 'relationship', 'mother', 'daugther', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'performance', 'credits', 'rolled', 'read', 'name', 'James', 'M.Cain', 'knew', 'was', 'surprise', 'point', 'figured', 'out', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'noir', 'film', 'Mildred', 'Pierce', 'impressed', 'so', 'much', 'consider', 'one', 'all-time', 'great', 'noir', 'films.As', 'watched', 'film', 'started', 'thinking', 'Lana', 'Turner\\Tony', 'Stompanato', 'scandal', 'remember', 'Turner', 'daughter', 'said', 'shot', 'Stompanato', 'self-defense', 'thought', 'perhaps', 'film', 'was', 'based', 'incident', 'thank', 'goodness', 'internet', 'was', 'able', 'research', 'Lana', 'Turner', 'story', 'found', 'happened', '1958', 'Mildred', 'Pierce', 'was', 'made', '1945', 'there', 'went', 'theory', 'guess', 'what', 'Mildred', 'Pierce', 'could', 'be', 'described', 'case', 'life', 'imatating', 'art', 'have', 'admit', 'are', 'connections', 'Mildred', 'Pierce', 'kind', 'hard', 'describe', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', ""'ll"", 'reveal', 'too', 'much', 'considering', 'fact', 'movie', 'considered', 'classic', 'many', 'may', 'already', 'know', 'story', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'much', 'should', 'tell', 'Maybe', 'best', ""don't.It"", 'odd', 'think', 'movie', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'was', 'never', 'even', 'nominated', 'Oscar', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'Pierce', 'really', 'best', 'performance', 'Back', '1930s', 'when', 'was', 'working', 'MGM', 'Crawford', 'made', 'truly', 'amazing', 'films', 'movies', 'dealth', 'taboo', 'subjects', 'Think', 'performance', 'Paid', 'working', 'girl', 'who', 'studies', 'law', 'actually', 'police', 'production', 'code', 'set', 'may', 'have', 'noticed', 'one', 'themes', 'most', 'films', 'was', 'crime', ""n't"", 'pay', 'Here', 'Crawford', 'showing', 'maybe', 'Or', 'what', 'Laughing', 'Sinners', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'co-stars', 'too', 'dealt', 'touchy', 'subjects', 'shame', 'think', 'Crawford', 'work', 'had', 'gone', 'unappreciated', 'Academy', ""n't"", 'way', 'always', 'Actors', 'actress', 'give', 'one', 'great', 'performance', 'never', 'win', 'award', 'when', 'finally', 'do', 'win', 'lesser', 'performance', 'mean', 'do', 'mean', 'tell', 'Scent', 'A', 'Woman', 'really', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'best', 'performance', 'Crawford', 'good', 'Pierce', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'only', 'performance', 'ever', 'won', 'Mildred', 'Pierce', 'great', 'job', 'creating', 'noir', 'mood', 'Pay', 'attention', 'use', 'shadows', 'lighting', 'Look', 'scene', 'end', 'Pierce', 'Veda', 'Ann', 'Blyth', 'Monte', 'Zachary', 'Scott', 'basement', 'Notice', 'how', 'Crawford', 'darkness', 'literally', 'metaphorically', 'find', 'out', 'truth', 'daughter', 'Monte', 'Also', 'pay', 'attention', 'Crawford', 'shoulders', 'more', 'money', 'power', 'broader', 'shoulders', 'are', 'made', 'look', 'Giving', 'almost', 'masculine', 'look', 'Mildred', 'Pierce', 'was', 'nominated', '6', 'Oscars', 'including', 'Best', 'Picture', 'lost', 'year', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'Lost', 'Weekend', 'Ann', 'Blyth', 'Eva', 'Arden', 'were', 'up', 'best', 'supporting', 'actress', 'was', 'film', 'screenplay', 'Oddly', 'movie', 'director', 'Michael', 'Curtiz', 'Casablanca', 'was', 'not', 'nominated', 'wonder', 'why', 'Bottom-line', 'One', 'best', 'noir', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'lasting', 'impression', 'viewer', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Crawford', 'best', 'performance', 'effective', 'nonetheless']",N/A
144763,AGEIT17HENDIS,0792840054,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 0]","Apparently the urge to overindulge one's children is not solely a recurring phenomenon of the ""baby-boomer"" generations. And just as apparently the object of those 1940s indulgences were, as in the film under review Mildred Pierce, just as ungrateful as the children of today's baby-boomers. At least in fiction just in case one of those current objects stumbles on to this review.Now the name of high- end steamy pot-boiler novelist  James M. Cain is well-known to this writer. His classic Double Indemnity and The Postman Always Rings Twice (and their film adaptations) have been fulsomely reviewed in this space. But here is the twist in Mildred Pierce. While saucy housewife waiting to break out from stifling suburban existence (1940s California suburban, there is a difference), that self-same Mildred Pierce (played by Joan Crawford) of the title, has her own qualifications for femme fatale-dom in a demure way the real femme here is strictly junior varsity, her daughter, Veda (played kittenishly by Ann Blyth). So it was a little disconcerting, after having seen the likes of Miss Cora (played by Lana Turner) in Postman and Barbara Stanwyck in Double Indemnity twist their men around so badly that they could not see straight and came back for more, and gladly, to see this junior varsity edition at work. But not for long.I better lay out the drift of story and you will see what I mean. California suburban housewife and devoted mother Mildred, up from poverty, or close to it, wanted to give her two daughters (although only Veda counts) what she didn't have. Fair enough. But apparently something got messed up in the Pierce gene pool or in any social or moral sensibilities as they passed to Veda. Veda, no matter what, wanted more and everything. Well Papa Pierce fell on hard times (and was doing a little two-timing as well) and the Pierces decided to divorce. Mildred decided, very unconventionally for the times, to open a restaurant to keep the wolves from the door (and keep Veda in things, many things, ungratefully accepted). Part of that process was to get backing, and a few breaks. The backing comes from Wally (a money mad real estate deal maker) and the breaks from Monte, scion to a descending family fortune but still capable of putting on the high society faux charm for Mildred (and Veda).The whole mix, the whole class mix, was wrong though, and because this is a crime film noir something bad had to happen. And the callous and very class-conscious Monte was the fall guy, a very dead fall guy with about six slugs in him. As the film unwinds backwards to find out who did the dastardly deed  about five different candidates emerge, including Mildred, ready to fall on their swords to protect someone. That someone of course being Veda who when Monte threw her over got, uh, a little high strung and wasted the poor guy. As always though in crime noir truth and justice will win out and Veda had to take her fall and will have many a lonely night to think over her errors in some dank California women's prison far from the bright lights of Los Angeles night clubs. Hey, nobody said every femme fatale, junior edition, was going made it to the ""bigs.""P.S. I don't  know about you but after watching some of these Cain film adaptations and a few other crime noir gems like Jane Greer in Out Of The Past and Rita Hayworth  in The Lady From Shang-hai somebody should take these femmes aside and give them a little instruction in shooting with guns. They all seem, and maybe it is because they are a little nervous or agitated, to feel the need to pump about six slugs in every guy that has wronged them. Terrible waste of ammo, terrible, although like I said maybe they were just the slightest bit angry at the time.",4,"Femme Fatale, Junior Edition",1341360000,"07 4, 2012",2012,3749,"['Apparently', 'urge', 'overindulge', 'one', 'children', 'not', 'solely', 'recurring', 'phenomenon', 'baby-boomer', 'generations', 'just', 'as', 'apparently', 'object', '1940s', 'indulgences', 'were', 'film', 'review', 'Mildred', 'Pierce', 'just', 'as', 'ungrateful', 'children', 'today', 'baby-boomers', 'least', 'fiction', 'just', 'case', 'one', 'current', 'objects', 'stumbles', 'name', 'high-', 'end', 'steamy', 'pot-boiler', 'novelist', 'James', 'M.', 'Cain', 'well-known', 'writer', 'classic', 'Double', 'Indemnity', 'Postman', 'Always', 'Rings', 'Twice', 'film', 'adaptations', 'have', 'been', 'fulsomely', 'reviewed', 'space', 'here', 'twist', 'Mildred', 'Pierce', 'saucy', 'housewife', 'waiting', 'break', 'out', 'stifling', 'suburban', 'existence', '1940s', 'California', 'suburban', 'difference', 'self-same', 'Mildred', 'Pierce', 'played', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'title', 'own', 'qualifications', 'femme', 'fatale-dom', 'demure', 'way', 'real', 'femme', 'here', 'strictly', 'junior', 'varsity', 'daughter', 'Veda', 'played', 'kittenishly', 'Ann', 'Blyth', 'was', 'little', 'disconcerting', 'having', 'seen', 'likes', 'Miss', 'Cora', 'played', 'Lana', 'Turner', 'Postman', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'Double', 'Indemnity', 'twist', 'men', 'so', 'badly', 'could', 'not', 'see', 'straight', 'came', 'back', 'more', 'gladly', 'see', 'junior', 'varsity', 'edition', 'work', 'not', 'long.I', 'better', 'lay', 'out', 'drift', 'story', 'will', 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'California', 'suburban', 'housewife', 'devoted', 'mother', 'Mildred', 'up', 'poverty', 'close', 'wanted', 'give', 'two', 'daughters', 'only', 'Veda', 'what', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'Fair', 'enough', 'apparently', 'something', 'got', 'messed', 'up', 'Pierce', 'gene', 'pool', 'social', 'moral', 'sensibilities', 'passed', 'Veda', 'Veda', 'matter', 'what', 'wanted', 'more', 'everything', 'Well', 'Papa', 'Pierce', 'fell', 'hard', 'times', 'was', 'doing', 'little', 'two-timing', 'well', 'Pierces', 'decided', 'divorce', 'Mildred', 'decided', 'very', 'unconventionally', 'times', 'open', 'restaurant', 'keep', 'wolves', 'door', 'keep', 'Veda', 'things', 'many', 'things', 'ungratefully', 'accepted', 'Part', 'process', 'was', 'get', 'backing', 'few', 'breaks', 'backing', 'Wally', 'money', 'mad', 'real', 'estate', 'deal', 'maker', 'breaks', 'Monte', 'scion', 'descending', 'family', 'fortune', 'still', 'capable', 'putting', 'high', 'society', 'faux', 'charm', 'Mildred', 'Veda', '.The', 'whole', 'mix', 'whole', 'class', 'mix', 'was', 'wrong', 'crime', 'film', 'something', 'bad', 'had', 'happen', 'callous', 'very', 'class-conscious', 'Monte', 'was', 'fall', 'guy', 'very', 'dead', 'fall', 'guy', 'six', 'slugs', 'film', 'backwards', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'did', 'dastardly', 'deed', 'five', 'different', 'candidates', 'emerge', 'including', 'Mildred', 'ready', 'fall', 'swords', 'protect', 'someone', 'someone', 'course', 'being', 'Veda', 'who', 'when', 'Monte', 'threw', 'got', 'uh', 'little', 'high', 'strung', 'wasted', 'poor', 'guy', 'always', 'crime', 'noir', 'truth', 'justice', 'will', 'win', 'out', 'Veda', 'had', 'take', 'fall', 'will', 'have', 'many', 'lonely', 'night', 'think', 'errors', 'dank', 'California', 'women', 'prison', 'far', 'bright', 'lights', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'night', 'clubs', 'Hey', 'nobody', 'said', 'femme', 'fatale', 'junior', 'edition', 'was', 'going', 'made', 'bigs.', 'P.S', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'watching', 'Cain', 'film', 'adaptations', 'few', 'other', 'crime', 'noir', 'gems', 'Jane', 'Greer', 'Out', 'Past', 'Rita', 'Hayworth', 'Lady', 'Shang-hai', 'somebody', 'should', 'take', 'femmes', 'aside', 'give', 'little', 'instruction', 'shooting', 'guns', 'seem', 'maybe', 'are', 'little', 'nervous', 'agitated', 'feel', 'need', 'pump', 'six', 'slugs', 'guy', 'wronged', 'Terrible', 'waste', 'ammo', 'terrible', 'said', 'maybe', 'were', 'just', 'slightest', 'bit', 'angry', 'time']",N/A
144764,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0792840054,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","Best known for bringing Joan Crawford to an Oscar win, `Mildred Pierce' is a nice slice of contemporary crime noir heaven complete with slick performances, witty dialog and subtle yet engaging direction.  It pretty much has everything that one could ask for from a film of this genre, despite the fact that it pretty short of believable.  It's beyond entertaining and certainly one of the more satisfying films of the 40's.The film opens with a gunshot and a dead body and a murder investigation that leads to quite a discovery.Crawford plays Mildred, a devoted mother of two who throws out her prideful husband Bert and slums it as a waitress in order to provide for her doting daughter Kay and her spoiled brat of a daughter Veda.  She eventually makes good on her savvy business sense and unwavering determination and opens a chain of successful restaurants that launch her into wealth; wealth that her daughter and new husband Monte are all to eager to squander.Crawford is serviceable as Mildred, although I must say that I found her to be the films weakest link, performance wise.  She doesn't do anything wrong, but she also doesn't do anything remarkable here either.  I have yet to find Crawford stunning, but supposedly she was so I guess I have more to watch from her.  I don't understand the Oscar win, but I'm not mad at it.  Jack Carson was perhaps my favorite performance here.  He really understood the style of the 40's film noir, and his enthusiastic and often suggestive delivery really complimented the direction of the film.  He just captured my attention from beginning to end.  Eve Arden has a few scenes, but she uses them to the full; chewing scenery left and right with a solid mix of wit and charm.  Zachary Scott is full of seductive charms, but he also brushes each frame with that snooty presence that screams ""SCOUNDREL"".Ann Blyth is a revelation as Veda.  She completely makes a character that I absolutely loathe someone I desired to see in every scene.  Veda will probably go down for me as one of the most unlikable and despise-worthy characters in the history of cinema and yet she was utterly delicious thanks to Blyth.Despite the fact that I wanted to ring her neck, I couldn't help but smile every time she walked into view.I wished that the script had been fleshed out a little more, for there is a very large story to tell here and it isn't told (at times) in the best way.

The mother is incorrectly labeled as the femme fatale by some critics as again it should have been the daughter who is the one. As for the cast, the acting is not really that great and is hammy at times, and Joan Crawford, winner of the Oscar, is in reality a poor actress and a schemer at heart. She displays a lot of the typical qualities that are fitting of a soap opera star. That's why her films are not very appealing to watch which probably also explains why Bette Davis hated her guts as evidenced in What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? As for Crawford's award-winning performance, I believe the mink coat complete with shoulder pads did all of the work for her. Meanwhile, Mildred Pierce has a slow start, is sometimes filled with longueurs, and contains several far-fetched ideas such as the immediate success of Mildred the entrepreneur. It is also a predictable movie because a bit while of getting know to the rules of the game, the twist becomes fairly foreseeable. By the way, notice the house by the oceanfront by the precipice. It was owned by Michael Curtiz, and the house apparently sank into the Pacific Ocean in 1983. Elsewhere, there is an iconic image of Joan Crawford in her white dress holding up the revolver. Yet this is never shown in the film at all. So, why bother making it part of Mildred Pierce?

""Mildred Pierce"" is a documentary about the licentious family behind the failed restaurant chain -- and it's a sad thing, too, because this take on the fast-food experience came furnished with a full-service bar! See, Veda's was kind of the New York Dolls (or The Ramones, if you're homophobic) of the mom-and-pop scene: trash-talking, back-stabbing, guns blazing; it was all there under the surface, behind the twinkling eyes and sparkling lips.Don't believe me? Try this on for size. When Mildred's ""good"" daughter dies, it's nothing more than a mere afterthought. It's a real-life Cinderella in reverse. Mildred vows never to forget the little twerp based solely on the fact that the last word Kay utters is ""mother"" as she is fed a lethal overdose of oxygen by a doctor who's been paid off. If Kay were allowed to continue her existence a while longer before being squashed out -- and with it, all of America's hopes to remain innocent as the last threads of Rockwellian values to which we clung become unravelled in yet another ""punk rock"" parallel -- her full sentence probably would have gone something like, ""Mother, Veda will never love you because you don't own 5-star restaurants, just a silly fast-food chain."" Wise words, indeed.For no matter how much Mildred worked to wash herself clean of her fast-food taint, no matter how many barons and dandies she swallowed up on her way to a White Castle in the sky, her eldest daughter Veda resented the Styrofoam empire her mother had built for her, and hit the road to be a showgirl, if you know what I mean.So when you eat your next hamburger, don't think about how it's mostly just spinal shavings sprinkled with ""meat-tasting"" magic dust fashioned by chemists at MIT. No, think about how you will never, ever connect with your children (unless you were born with a silver spoon sticking out of your mouth and it's still there when they pop out) because they will leave the nest as soon as they can out of shame, and probably ruin your marriage in the process.Cue sunset.

Carroll,"[9, 11]","Warner has done a wonderful job of restoring this magnificent melodrama, and whatever you think of Crawford, she was rarely given such a marvellous opportunity nor surrounded by so many great talents. Chief among these is director Michael Curtiz who proves yet again why he was one of the great directors of the era. His trade mark roving camera style which made Rick's cafe in CASABLANCA seem a real place that one wants to revisit over and over again, here creates an almost voyeurs view of events in 1940s LA, especially at Monty Berrigan's Beach House, a superb stylised set by the unsung genius of Hollywood Art Directors - Anton Grot. Add to all this, Steiner's magnificent score, Ernest Hallers deep focus photography and a witty, laconic script by Ranad MacDougall which offers so many memorable lines, and you have a defining example of Holywood's most glamorous noir style. Ann Blyth was nominated as Best Supporting Actress and should have won for her stomach-churning daughter-from-hell - and why she never got better parts afterwards is a mystery. Jack Carson is surprisingly effective as the oily Wally Fay [Carson was another wasted actor in Hollywood, rarely getting good roles), Eve Arden is sublime [she has so many great lines;e.g. as Jack Carson eyes her legs she says 'Leave SOMEthing on me!] and Zachary Scott is perfectly cast as the rich, slimy Monty Berrigan. Maybe it does water down the novel but it is so richly entertaining, who cares? Crawford seized this role (after arch-rival Bette Davis turned it down) and gives a superlative performance that is quintessential Crawford.The DVD is nicely done.

I can't think of a more despicable character than that played by Blyth, the selfishness and meanness of her is incredible.

Joan Crawford delivers a terrific performance as Mildred Pierce, a middle-aged women desperately trying to provide for her daughters as her marriage collapses. Told mostly in flashbacks, the film opens with a man being shot in a fancy Southern California beach house. The police pick-up Mildred and start questioning her, since it's her 2nd husband who is dead. Mildred recounts the ups and downs or her life and her inexplicable drive to win-over the love of her children, especially her spoiled, demanding eldest daughter named Veda.The acting in Mildred Pierce is incredible. Crawford hits all the right  notes as the workaholic mother with poor taste in men but a golden touch for running a business. She's almost overshadowed by Ann Blyth as the pampered, obnoxious teenage daughter Veda. Zachary Scott as Mildred's playboy second husband and a wisecracking Eve Arden add a lot of color to the cast.

Joan Crawford is in her element as the long suffering mother of a rotten child who drips with contempt for her mother's job as a waitress.

Then her second marriage to a penniless and money grubbing twerp who thinks nothing of seducing her daughter, and of course exhausting all means including body and soul just to win the affections and respect from her ungrateful, ruthless daughter. My only complaint is what's with the shoddy cardboard cases? Warner Brothers thinks this is a  good way to honor their star?

When her husband Bert (Bruce Bennett) moves on to greener pastures, Mildred has no other option than to fling on the shoulderpads and enter the workforce.  Despite her eventual success in opening a chain of restaurants, nothing she ever does or provides is ""good enough"" for Veda.  Her ego spinning wildly out of control, Veda manipulates her mother and everyone around her, with dire consequences...MILDRED PIERCE features some classic confrontation scenes between Crawford and Ann Blyth, who is so good as the evil Veda that you just want to throttle her!  Based on the novel by James M. Cain (who also wrote ""The Postman Always Rings Twice""), MILDRED PIERCE revived Joan Crawford's flagging film career and gave way to a series of similarly-themed noir drama roles at Warner Brothers.  The amazing cast also includes Jack Carson, Lee Patrick, Zachary Scott and Eve Arden as Mildred's wisecracking best friend (in what surprisingly turned out to be her sole Oscar-nominated performance).Followers of the infamous Joan Crawford/Bette Davis rivalry will be quick to notice that Max Steiner's musical score recycles portions of the main love theme from the 1942 Bette Davis vehicle ""Now Voyager"" (mostly during Crawford's love scenes).  Whether or not Crawford noticed this, it's another great twist in the story of the reportedly bitter feud during their days as Warner Brothers' premier leading ladies.The DVD includes a brilliantly-restored print of the movie (it's the best this title has ever looked on home video).  Bonus features (on the flipside of the disc) are just as good, with the acclaimed  feature-length TCM documentary ""Crawford: The Ultimate Movie Star"", narrated by Anjelica Huston, and featuring interviews with surviving co-stars and directors, biographers, historians, plus Crawford's adopted daughter Christina (who talks about the incidents in her book ""Mommie Dearest"").

Mildred worships Vida, in spie of the fact that Vida is moody, verbally abusive, and impossible to please.Vida wants to be &quot;rich&quot;, but when Mildred makes lots of money, it still  doesn't suit Vida because her mother worked (ew, yuck) for it.

For a film to be called film noir there needs to be a gritty realism to it. This is merely melodrama. Film noir penetrates deeply into character. This film is propelled not by character exigencies but by the Dumbest Possible Action theory, and also by having any real world issues too easily solved, as well as that old Hollywood standby- style over substance. But, because the work is immanently melodramatic, the foregrounding of style over any deeper elements, actually makes the film more enjoyable as a guilty pleasure. And, on that score, Mildred Pierce is terrific. No, it is not a film filled with cosmic profundities nor with great performances for the ages. But, it is a film loaded with charm and appeal, and a `who cares if it's over the top?' attitude that damns any claims of pretense, and frees the film into being itself, that guilty soap opera that you love, but don't want anyone else to know you love, unless you tell first.

I saw the murder take place, and I was hooked. I watched the rest of the film, glued to the screen. To say that Joan Crawford ruled this film is a major understatement. She thouroughly dominated the screen from beginning to end. In a way, she WAS Mildred, the story drew strong parallels to her own life. Ann Blyth was PERFECT as the wanna-be rich snob Veda. Eve Arden should have had more time in this film, she was needed relief from the seriousness of the story. All three principle female leads got academy award nominations for this film, Crawford won Best Actress, and there's no arguing she deserved it. As the plot has been dissected and gone over repeatedly before, I'll focus on the DVD release. The film transferred beautifully, with razor-sharp definition and wonderful light and dark areas. This film is true film noir, and the lighting played a major role in the movie. On the disc flip side, there is a wonderful documentary on Crawford's life called ""Joan Crawford: The Ultimate Movie Star"". The documentary is well-worth watching on its own, so to have it included is great. All in all, it's easy to see why Crawford was very proud of this film, it represented her commercial comeback after MGM put her out to pasture, saying she was too old, and box office poison.

Following Johnny Guitar (1954), her 82nd film, she turned her attention to television and to Pepsi, the firm her new husband was involved in.FWIW - Crawford made a career in the 30s playing a working girl who succeeds, so her role in Mildred Pierce was perfect.Beautiful Ann Blyth (1928) plays the ungrateful daughter. Blyth made more than 20 films before turning her attentions to TV in the late 50s. She was nominated for an Oscar for her role in this film and won a Laurel for ""The Helen Morgan Story"" (1957).There is an excellent supporting cast with Jack Carson, Zach Scott, Eve Arden, Bruce Bennett, and Butterfly McQueen.Handsome Zachary Scott (1914-65) often played a scoundrel in films like ""Flamingo Road"" (1949) and ""Shadow on the Wall"" (1950), often paired with Ann Sothern, Nancy Davis, or Joan Crawford. Scott plays Crawford's husband and this is one of the few ""homme fatale"" in film noir.Funnyman Jack Carson (1910-63) plays a man infatuated with Crawford. Carson made 50+ films before transitioning to TV in the early 50s where he had his own show (1954-5). He's best known for his films with Dennis Morgan (""Shine on, Harvest Moon"", ""Two Guys from Milwaukee"").Bruce Bennett (1906-2007) plays Crawford's first husband. Bennett was a staple in B films in the 40s and 50s.Funny and sarcastic Eve Arden (1908-90) plays a friend of Crawford. She was nominated for an Oscar for this film but she's best known for her Emmy winning role as ""Our Miss Brooks"" (1952-6).Director Michael Curtiz (1886-1962) is best known for his 7 films with Errol Flynn. He was nominated for an Oscar for their first collaboration (""Captain Blood"", 1935), and received 2 more nominations for films with Jimmy Cagney - ""Angels with Dirty Faces""(1938) and ""Yankee Doddle Dandy"" (1941) - and one win for a film with Bogart (""Casablanca"", 1942). Curtiz had a sense of humor about himself - he once declared ""The next time I want an idiot to do this, I'll do it myself.""FWIW - The Malibu beach house in the film was actually Curtiz' own home.Ernest Haller (1896-1970) provides beautiful black and white photography and tilts toward film noir even if he doesn't embrace it fully. Haller filmed more than 100 movies and was nominated for an Oscar 7 times, three times for films with Bette Davis (""Jezebel"" in 1938, ""All This and Heaven Too"" in 1940, and ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?"" in 1962), and won once for ""GWTW"" (1939).Max Steiner (1888-1971) did the musical score. Between 1935 and 1956 he was nominated for an Oscar 19 times, and won for ""Since You Went Away"" (1944), ""Now Voyager"" (1942), and ""The Informer"" (1935). He was so well known that he appeared on a 33 cent stamp (1999) along with Dimitri Tiomkin and Alfred Newman.1945 was not a banner year for films. The top grossing films were ""Mom and Dad"", ""The Bells of St. Mary's"", ""Leave Her to Heaven"", ""Spellbound"", and ""Anchors Aweigh."" The big Oscar and Golden Globe winner was ""The Lost Weekend"" (Picture, Director, Actor). Notable films released that year included film noir classic ""Scarlett Street"".Variety called the film ""a class feature"" and said ""the dramatics are heavy but so skillfully handled that they never cloy."" The NY Times praised Crawford - ""a sincere and generally effective characterization"" - and Curtiz - ""cunning dramatic artifice"" -  but found the plot unconvincing.The film was nominated for 6 Oscars (Picture, Screenplay, Supporting Actress, Cinematography) but only Crawford won.The film benefits not only from great direction, photography, and acting, it's one of the few twists on the classic film noir where the female is the hapless hero led down a tragic path, and the ""femme fatale"" is actually a man (Zach Scott). If the film has any fault it is that it is a bit too long at 111 minutes.Bottom line - this classic film noir with a twist benefits from great acting, direction, and photography making it a must see for film fans.",5,Classic film noir with a twist,1316390400,"09 19, 2011",2011,4618,"['Mildred', 'Pierce', '1945', 'black', 'white', 'film', 'noir', 'long', 'suffering', 'mother', 'ungrateful',

And so the story unravels as Mildred tells her &quot;story&quot; to the police. It's all a mysterious cover-up.  And is worth watching to the very end! I loved this movie!!! If you are a fan of the &quot;classics&quot;, this is one of the greatest I've seen.  Joan Crawford plays Mildred.  She has two daughters, Veda and Kay.  Her husband up and leaves them, and now Mildred must get a job.  Kay catches a bad case of pneumonia, and dies.  Veda, who is the older daughter, doesn't turn out to be such a nice girl.  She grows into a coniving young woman, who bribes someone for money so she can get away from her embarrassment of a mother. Veda is played by Ann Blyth...What an actress!!! Veda is evil to the core, and Blyth really pulls it off. I'd hate to give to much of this movie away!  It's a must see!! This movie is brilliantly photographed, and Joan Crawford is totally awesome as Mildred.  I haven't seen many of her films, but it's clear that Crawford is in her prime here.  She really plays this character to the extreme.  She certainly did deserve the Oscar! The screenplay of this movie is great for it's time, and has some hilarious lines that are delivered dead on by the actor's.  This is &quot;film noir&quot; at it's best.  Go rent it!!!

I visited my Dad here in Hammond (can it really be ten years?) when I rented it from Blockbuster Video. I watched it on a Saturday during the NCAA Basketball tournament and I can tell you that out of all of the movies that I've seen in my life ""Mildred Pierce"" is the most shocking movie I ever saw. The movie is filled with one stunning revelation after another, but none was no more bigger than the scene in which Mildred confronts her daughter Veda (Ann Blyth) and as Crawford's character tears up the paper into pieces (was it really money?) Veda slaps her mother so hard she falls down on the stairs (you may recall earlier in the movie Mildred slapped Veda by accident; now Veda was getting her revenge). That was the most shocking scene I ever saw in a film; no movie that I have seen, past or present, comes close to that lightning bolt between Joan Crawford and Ann Blyth. As that weren't enough the film has TWO different perspecives on how Pierce's second husband got killed! For those who haven't seen it, they have to.

Mildred is an unsatisfied wife and a devoted mother. Too bad that she lavishes too much of her love on the wrong daughter, the one who'd rather not have to work for a living. Ann Blyth is an excellent Veda. She makes evil seem glamorous. Joan Crawford's Oscar was well deserved. Eve Arden is her usual excellent sarcastic self, Jack Carson is the sleazy salesman.

Wally, Mildred's ex-husband's ex-business partner, seems to have the single minded goal of getting into Mildred's now vacant pants.  Monte is an aging spendthrift playboy, who is violently alergic to work, and vampirically latches on to Mildred's purse.  Veda, Mildred's airhead daughter, is pure spoiled brat - nothing redeeming there, only a mother could love her.  To polish off this soap opera quality, there is an awkwardly inserted scene of a child's death for added melodrama.Mildred ties all these threads together as a good little housewife, who is striking out on her own to provide only the best for her daughter Veda.  Her character has the most depth (any depth at all is a change in this movie).  She remains motherly and virtuous, as she reallizes that she can be shark at business to keep the funds flowing for Veda's expensive hobbies.  Similarly, Joan Crawford, who plays Mildred, holds the film together.  It's so corny - I reallized this as I watched - and yet so gripping.

As she enters a world of affluence including a glamorous beach house, she finds herself in competition with her daughter for the affections of her scoundrel husband. The lovely Ann Blyth and foppish Zachary Scott play the semi-incestuous duo. Michael Curtiz turns in a solid directorial drama. George James Hopkins designed some memorable sets for the beach house and Crawford's business. Composer Max Steiner turns in another of his wonderful scores. Steiner is the composer who gave us that familiar Warner Brother's sound.

This is an interesting mix of &quot;women's film&quot; and &quot;film noir.&quot;  No easy task since the genres are so opposite in many ways.  And no, it's not always a successful mix. But what makes it ultimately work  is the same kind of &quot;dissonance&quot; also found in Curtiz'  &quot;Casablanca,&quot;--the grim world of noir vs.the womanly concerns of  romance and family.Joan Crawford is, well, Joan Crawford. Her steeliness  belies the purported warmth and lovingness of the title character.  There  are hints that her self-sacrifice is a kind of self-glorification (as her  husband pretty much states flat out during the argument they have just  before they separate).  The commentary by so many of the reviewers of this  film is incisive and goes some distance toward answering one of my key  questions about this film: Just how dated is it?  Perhaps like me you  groaned just a little bit during the interrogation scenes, perhaps you  cringed a tad when Joan Crawford (of all people) started mouthing  platitudes about motherhood and sacrifice.  But if you're at all like me,  you couldn't help but get caught up in this melodramtic mix.  It gets campy  in parts, but camp has to have a core of emotional truth if it's going to  succeed.Mildred Pierce succeeds very well indeed.  It is indeed a  fascinating amalgam of two wildly divergent styles.  As with  &quot;Casablanca&quot; before it, director Michael Curtiz offers a bit of  romance, a lot of self-sacrifice, and just enough intrigue.  It does comes  off a little dated then, but it's hardly just a period curio.

In the 30's and 40's, Hollywood's ""Women's Picture's"" reigned supreme with Stars like Bette Davis, Ida Lupino, Olivia DeHavilland and, of course, Joan Crawford. MILDRED PIERCE is quite possibly the best women's picture of al time.This was the first picture that Joan Crawford made after she signed with Warner Brothers after being forced out of M.G.M. Joan actually went on suspension while she waited for the ""right script"" and in this case, her instincts were right and the script well worth waiting for.Mildred Pierce, while in the planning stages was said to have been offered to Ann Sheridan, Ida Lupino and even Bette Davis. Michael Curtiz's first choice for this role was Barbara Stanwyck, who would have been great, but when Joan saw the script, she gladly auditioned for Mildred and was awarded the part.The real triumph of Mildred Pierce was the script. The original James M. Cain novel was interesting in its own way but unexciting. The was no murder in the novel. That's right! The device of adding the murder and telling the story in flashbacks is unique to this picture. It added a sense of intrigue and suspense which the novel and the pointless remake did not share.At the center of all this is Joan Crawford in the title role and, if you've never seen Joan at the top of her form, this is the one film you should see.The supporting cast is superb: Ann Blythe; Eve Arden; Jack Carson; Zachary Scott; JoAnn Marlow; Lee Patrick and Butterfly McQueen all sparkle with Blythe and Arden receiving Oscar nods for their work.Directed in a slick Film Noir Style by Michael Curtiz (Casablanca).The disc also contains the best biography of Joan Crawford that has ever been made making this DVD a must have for your home library.",5,"The Ultimate ""Woman's Picture""",1373587200,"07 12, 2013",2013,1790,"['Yes', 'chick', 'flik', 'much', 'more', '30', '40', 'Hollywood', 'Women', 'Picture', 'reigned', 'supreme', 'Stars', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'Ida', 'Lupino', 'Olivia', 'DeHavilland', 'course', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'MILDRED', 'PIERCE', 'quite', 'possibly', 'best', 'women', 'picture', 'al', 'time.This', 'was', 'first', 'picture', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'made', 'signed', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'being', 'forced', 'M.G.M', 'Joan', 'actually', 'went', 'suspension', 'waited', 'right', 'script', 'case', 'instincts', 'were', 'right', 'script', 'well', 'worth', 'waiting', 'for.Mildred', 'Pierce', 'planning', 'stages', 'was', 'said', 'have', 'been', 'offered', 'Ann', 'Sheridan', 'Ida', 'Lupino', 'even', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'Michael', 'Curtiz', 'first', 'choice', 'role', 'was', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'when', 'Joan', 'saw', 'script', 'gladly', 'auditioned', 'Mildred', 'was', 'awarded', 'part.The', 'real', 'triumph', 'Mildred', 'Pierce', 'was', 'script', 'original', 'James', 'M.', 'Cain', 'novel', 'was', 'interesting', 'own', 'way', 'unexciting', 'was', 'murder', 'novel', 'right', 'device', 'adding', 'murder', 'telling', 'story', 'flashbacks', 'unique', 'picture', 'added', 'sense', 'intrigue', 'suspense', 'novel', 'pointless', 'remake', 'did', 'not', 'share.At', 'center', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'title', 'role', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Joan', 'top', 'form', 'one', 'film', 'should', 'see.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'superb', 'Ann', 'Blythe', 'Eve', 'Arden', 'Jack', 'Carson', 'Zachary', 'Scott', 'JoAnn', 'Marlow', 'Lee', 'Patrick', 'Butterfly', 'McQueen', 'sparkle', 'Blythe', 'Arden', 'receiving', 'Oscar', 'nods', 'work.Directed', 'slick', 'Film', 'Noir', 'Style', 'Michael', 'Curtiz', 'Casablanca', '.The', 'disc', 'also', 'best', 'biography', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'ever', 'been', 'made', 'making', 'DVD', 'must', 'have', 'home', 'library']",N/A

Great melodrama, and superbly acted by the entire cast. Joan Crawford's turn as the selfless, ambitious single mom is quite convincing, and Ann Blyth's performance as her selfish, spoiled, and unfeeling daughter is truly gut wrenching to watch. As the story unfolds, you wonder why mom continues to jump through flaming hoops to please her witch of a daughter. Eve Arden is at her scene stealing best as Ida, her restaurant manager. She is truly a joy to watch, and I found myself wishing her role would have been larger.This dvd also includes a documentary about the legendary Crawford, with interesting tidbits about the rift between Joan and Bette Davis, wonderfully narrated by Angelica Huston.

144827,A192KEPM0HW6AC,0792840054,"Interplanetary Funksmanship ""Swift lippin', e...","[4, 5]","Director Michael Curtiz (""The Adventures of Robin Hood,""  Casablanca"") brings another James M. Cain (""Double Indemnity,"" ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"") steamy pulp novel to life on the silver screen with the immortal ""Mildred Pierce.""With her portrayal as the title character, Joan Crawford gives a performance that places her in such august company as Barbara Stanwyck as the bottle blonde Phyllis Dietrichson in ""Double Indemnity"" (1944, dir: Billy Wilder) and Lana Turner's ambitious Cora in ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" (1946, dir: Tay Garnett).Mildred, like Cora, is a driven woman, bent on commercial success. Crawford rightly earned the Best Actress Oscar for her role as the modern businesswoman, a model of ruthless ambition, making her mark and her way in a traditionally man's world. Following her transformation from ditched housewife to waitress to restauranteurand tycoon, the viewer readily identifies with Mildred's struggle and sacrifice to make it big. ""Mildred Pierce"" is one of the screen's all-time inspirational portrayals of woman as efficacious heroine, a paragon of efficiency.Yet, it is also a deeply human tragedy of Shakeperian dimensions, for Mildred is also a flawed heroine, on the same scale as Othello or Hamlet. What drives Mildred is not a clean motivation such as personal fulfillment as a businesswoman nor even a simple one such as amassing a fortune to obtain financial security. Rather, Mildred is driven by a Fatal Flaw -- insecurity and fear of failure.For it is not the curse of the ancient Greek tragic heroes -- hubris -- but utter selflessness and altruism that brings down the House of Mildred. The object of Mildred's Mother Teresa-like compassion and sacrifice is the one person who holds veto power over her emotions and wallet, her conceited eldest daughter Veda, played by Ann Blyth. What Veda wants, Veda gets. The ultimate spoiled daughter, her lower middle-class parents give her ""the best of everything"" (pun intended -- another great Joan Crawford flick, also produced by Jerry Wald), from piano lessons to tailored dresses. Bent of giving Veda ""everything I couldn't have,"" Mildred's motivation is for her daughter to not only rise above, but to blot out the family's humble and plebian origins.After her husband, the wooden but commonsensical Bert (played by Bruce Bennett) leaves her for another woman, Mildred becomes a waitress in order provide for Veda. She even hires a maid, but never divulges to Veda the nature of how the money comes in to put food on the table. She is literally ashamed to face Veda with her workaday persona, and when confronted, makes up a story about being a waitress in order to learn the restaurant business.So, playing the role, Mildred opens a restaurant, and to her surprise, learns she's got the knack for it. But, as she becomes more successful, and as the money rolls in, Veda's avaricious appetite grows larger. The once innocent looking bobby soxerhigh-school girl has become ""a young lady of very expensive tastes,"" and naturally, Mildred caters to those tastes, even going so far as marrying a man she doesn't love in order to keep Veda in the lap of luxury. But that's not enough for Veda, who herself marries a boy she's not in love with, just to cash in on his fortune.""Mildred Pierce"" is an all around masterpiece: Ernest Haller's camerawork is classic 1940s noir, but with Jerry Wald's slick production, looks almost five years more modern than its later Warner's counterpart, Howard Hawks' ""The Big Sleep"" (1946) and looks forward to more great Wald noir with ""Key Largo"" and ""Dark Passage."" The supporting cast is stellar, in particular Eve Arden as Ida, Mildred's wisecracking pal and mentor in the restaurant business, Zachary Scott plays Monty Beragon, Mildred's weaselly Latin playboy husband, Jack Carson is the hard-nosed Wally, her slick and slippery business partner and Moroni Olson (a veteran Warner's contract player) as the detective who interrogates Mildred (a typical noir device, which sets the narrative for the movie, but with the twist that it's a woman telling the story, not the male detective, con, sap or sucker).Max Steiner's score sobs, throbs and rumbles, with its sweet violin strains underscoring Mildred's sacrifice and humanity and plenty of foreboding low strings and brass a la Richard Wagner intoning the movie's tragic violence.""Mildred Pierce"" more than holds its own in the Cain trilogy and is a unique and first-rate movie. It will leave Joan Crawford fans on their feet cheering.",5,Saint Joan,1051401600,"04 27, 2003",2003,4530,"['Director', 'Michael', 'Curtiz', 'Adventures', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'Casablanca', 'James', 'M.', 'Cain', 'Double', 'Indemnity', 'Postman', 'Always', 'Rings', 'Twice', 'steamy', 'pulp', 'novel', 'life', 'silver', 'screen', 'immortal', 'Mildred', 'Pierce', 'portrayal', 'title', 'character', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'performance', 'such', 'august', 'company', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'bottle', 'blonde', 'Phyllis', 'Dietrichson', 'Double', 'Indemnity', '1944', 'dir', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'Lana', 'Turner', 'ambitious', 'Cora', 'Postman', 'Always', 'Rings', 'Twice', '1946', 'dir', 'Tay', 'Garnett', '.Mildred', 'Cora', 'driven', 'woman', 'bent', 'commercial', 'success', 'Crawford', 'rightly', 'earned', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Oscar', 'role', 'modern', 'businesswoman', 'model', 'ruthless', 'ambition', 'making', 'mark', 'way', 'traditionally', 'man', 'world', 'Following', 'transformation', 'ditched', 'housewife', 'waitress', 'restauranteurand', 'tycoon', 'viewer', 'readily', 'Mildred', 'struggle', 'sacrifice', 'make', 'big', 'Mildred', 'Pierce', 'one', 'screen', 'all-time', 'inspirational', 'portrayals', 'woman', 'efficacious', 'heroine', 'paragon', 'efficiency.Yet', 'also', 'deeply', 'human', 'tragedy', 'Shakeperian', 'dimensions', 'Mildred', 'also', 'flawed', 'heroine', 'same', 'scale', 'Othello', 'Hamlet', 'What', 'Mildred', 'not', 'clean', 'motivation', 'such', 'personal', 'fulfillment', 'businesswoman', 'even', 'simple', 'one', 'such', 'amassing', 'fortune', 'obtain', 'financial', 'security', 'Rather', 'Mildred', 'driven', 'Fatal', 'Flaw', 'insecurity', 'fear', 'failure.For', 'not', 'curse', 'ancient', 'Greek', 'tragic', 'heroes', 'hubris', 'utter', 'selflessness', 'altruism', 'down', 'House', 'Mildred', 'object', 'Mildred', 'Mother', 'Teresa-like', 'compassion', 'sacrifice', 'one', 'person', 'who', 'veto', 'power', 'emotions', 'wallet', 'conceited', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'Veda', 'played', 'Ann', 'Blyth', 'What', 'Veda', 'Veda', 'ultimate', 'spoiled', 'daughter', 'lower', 'middle-class', 'parents', 'give', 'best', 'everything', 'pun', 'intended', 'great', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'flick', 'also', 'produced', 'Jerry', 'Wald', 'piano', 'lessons', 'tailored', 'dresses', 'Bent', 'giving', 'Veda', 'everything', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'Mildred', 'motivation', 'daughter', 'not', 'only', 'rise', 'blot', 'out', 'family', 'humble', 'plebian', 'origins.After', 'husband', 'wooden', 'commonsensical', 'Bert', 'played', 'Bruce', 'Bennett', 'woman', 'Mildred', 'waitress', 'order', 'provide', 'Veda', 'even', 'maid', 'never', 'Veda', 'nature', 'how', 'money', 'put', 'food', 'table', 'literally', 'ashamed', 'face', 'Veda', 'workaday', 'persona', 'when', 'confronted', 'up', 'story', 'being', 'waitress', 'order', 'learn', 'restaurant', 'business.So', 'playing', 'role', 'Mildred', 'restaurant', 'surprise', 'got', 'knack', 'more', 'successful', 'money', 'rolls', 'Veda', 'avaricious', 'appetite', 'grows', 'larger', 'once', 'innocent', 'looking', 'bobby', 'soxerhigh-school', 'girl', 'become', 'young', 'lady', 'very', 'expensive', 'tastes', 'naturally', 'Mildred', 'caters', 'tastes', 'even', 'going', 'so', 'far', 'marrying', 'man', ""n't"", 'love', 'order', 'keep', 'Veda', 'lap', 'luxury', 'not', 'enough', 'Veda', 'who', 'boy', 'not', 'love', 'just', 'cash', 'fortune', 'Mildred', 'Pierce', 'masterpiece', 'Ernest', 'Haller', 'camerawork', 'classic', '1940s', 'noir', 'Jerry', 'Wald', 'slick', 'production', 'almost', 'five', 'years', 'more', 'modern', 'later', 'Warner', 'counterpart', 'Howard', 'Hawks', 'Big', 'Sleep', '1946', 'forward', 'more', 'great', 'Wald', 'noir', 'Key', 'Largo', 'Dark', 'Passage', 'supporting', 'cast', 'stellar', 'particular', 'Eve', 'Arden', 'Ida', 'Mildred', 'wisecracking', 'pal', 'mentor', 'restaurant', 'business', 'Zachary', 'Scott', 'Monty', 'Beragon', 'Mildred', 'weaselly', 'Latin', 'playboy', 'husband', 'Jack', 'Carson', 'hard-nosed', 'Wally', 'slick', 'slippery', 'business', 'partner', 'Moroni', 'Olson', 'veteran', 'Warner', 'contract', 'player', 'detective', 'who', 'Mildred', 'typical', 'noir', 'device', 'narrative', 'movie', 'twist', 'woman', 'telling', 'story', 'not', 'male', 'detective', 'con', 'sap', 'sucker', '.Max', 'Steiner', 'score', 'sobs', 'throbs', 'rumbles', 'sweet', 'violin', 'strains', 'underscoring', 'Mildred', 'sacrifice', 'humanity', 'plenty', 'foreboding', 'low', 'strings', 'brass', 'la', 'Richard', 'Wagner', 'intoning', 'movie', 'tragic', 'violence', 'Mildred', 'Pierce', 'more', 'own', 'Cain', 'trilogy', 'unique', 'first-rate', 'movie', 'will', 'leave', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'fans', 'feet', 'cheering']",N/A

First of all,  I'm not a Crawford fan, although I will admit she's good in the movie.  Secondly, I have hard time believing this mother-daughter relationship  (it's too extreme).

Blyth never got much of a chance during her career to strut her stuff very much: with a piping soprano and a pretty smile, she was mostly stuck playing ingenue parts in Technicolor musicals or light comedy parts in popular fare like MR. PEABODY AND THE MERMAID. But here she got the role of a lifetime and she never lets it go: usually sugary-sweet, her Veda is capable of betraying hideous snobbery or cruelty without ever dropping the polite smirk. The writers (mostly the screenplay is the work of Ranald MacDougall, though William Faulkner had a hand in it) seemed to have risen to the occasion and give Blyth some of the funniest poisonous little lines of the era: ""My mother--a waitress!"" she hisses once she discovers the truth about how Joan Crawford has been supporting the family. This isn't Crawford's best work for Warner's (that would come two years later with POSSESSED), and at times she gives into her habit (as Pauline Kael memorably put it) of looking as if she has toothache when she intends to emote very heavily, but her hairstyle and outfits in this role are iconic, and she's fairly funny when she has to wait tables and issue snappy barking orders to her restaurant's cooks. Lots of fine character actors are about as fun as they ever were in their careers playing some of their most typical roles in this movie: Eve Arden as the heroine's smartmouthed best friend, Zacharty Scott as Mildred's oily lover, Jack Carson as the oafish chump who keeps hitting on Mildred and who gets in trouble for his pains. There's also a nice tiny performance by Lee Patrick as the vulgar but kindhearted Mrs. Biederhof, for whom Mildred's first husband leaves her.

Just some thoughts on this 1940s Joan Crawford classic...Mildred Pierce (1945) was Joan Crawford's one and only Academy Award winning performance.  I think she also should have won for either Possessed (1947) or Sudden Fear (1952), or both.  Mildred Pierce shows a 40-year-old Joan Crawford arguably at her peak in her acting career.  She gives a great performance in the leading role and definitely deserved to win her Oscar.  Watch this classic to see fine acting performances by the whole cast, especially Crawford.  The story is full of twists and turns and is flat out unpredictable.  Definitely a fun ride.  Everything in this movie is perfect.  If you want to see the biggest spoiled brat daughter in movie history, watch this movie!Crawford went through many incarnations over the years and kept reinventing herself (which is actually a smart thing to do for career survival).  Personally, I think she looked her best from the late 1920s through the 1940s.  Starting in the 1940s she began to change her appearance a little bit into what most people visualize when they think of Joan Crawford.  She started developing what became her signature look during this time and still looked great.  She changed again in the early 1950s.  Ironically, this was the period of time when her career started declining.  I've always wondered if there's a connection there - she changed her look (in the face) for the worse, in my opinion, and then her career started to decline.  By the 1960s she was starring in horror movies (not that it's a bad thing in my book).  Her drastic change in appearance made her look kind of scary in a way, which got her cast in horror movies, I think.  She developed a ""harder"" look during the '50s, and '60s.  In the '20s and '30s she had more of a pleasant, softer, inviting look.Mildred Pierce?

144851,A6ADO7B6FUVN,0792840054,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[8, 11]","Mildred Pierce, the novel, tells the story of the self-made homemaker Mildred Pierce sometime in the middle of the Great Depression who decides to fight against the destitute and indifferent era.  Through her honed skills in baking, she makes delightfully tasty cakes and pies, which leads her to the realization that she can become the breadwinner.  It also deals with several family issues such as divorce, parenting, and death.  Yet, the overshadowing theme that heavily hangs over the whole story seems to be responsibility, as the characters often shift their own responsibility to the motherly, strong, and independent woman Mildred.  The cinematic adaptation makes one significant change with the story by changing it from a drama to a thriller, or more precisely to murky genre film-noir by introducing a murder into the story.The heavy buzzing sound of an airplane departing from Chicago with Amsterdam as its designated destination served as the location for my screening.  The lights were out and people were sleeping, as I carefully placed the headphones over my ears and turned on my laptop to view this historical film-noir.  The opening credits emerging across the sand dunes while washed away by the waves of the ocean brought me the notion of life's cyclical pattern.  Maybe it serves the theme of a mother's nurturing care and idea for parental responsibility, or just tries to enhance the mysterious concept that surrounds film noir.  Anyway, the opening scene shows two brief night shots of an isolated luxury beach house with a third scene of a man falling over by a gun shot in the chest.  Undoubtedly, the opening smacks the audience with suspense from the first minute, as the perpetrator tosses the gun on top of the rapidly dying man.[Deductive Spoilers Ahead]In a coastal town not far from the luxurious beach house, a woman, who the audience eventually will identify as Mildred Pierce (Joan Crawford), stands by the railing of pier while teary-eyed staring down in the water.  She steps up on the edge, preparing herself for a plunge when a police office slams the railing with his club.  Stunned out of her miserable moment she stops, as the police officer asks her, ""What's on your mind, lady?"" She brushes him off by asking him to leave her alone.  Instead, the police officer provides a simplistic answer of responsibility and the consequences of her actions.  Yet, it is within this basic idea, which the films gem rests.When Mildred's first plan did not succeed, she attempts a second, by bringing the old friend and owner of a bar Wally Fay (Jack Carson) to the same beach house with the murdered man from a couple of scenes ago.  They have a long friendship that stem from his affectionate care and interest in her, which has soured over some business deals.  Due to the circumstances, hastily Mildred acts, as if she changed her mind about Wally and invites him to her beach house.  It is not the kind of invitation that was common in the thirty's, as she is married.  Yet, in some way, Mildred attempts to pin the murder on Wally.  However, things do not run as planned, as the police later picks her up.  From this moment on, things are getting even more complicated, which forces her to tell the true story about the murder.Through Mildred's voice-over, a flash back retells a lengthy tale starting from when she was a housewife.  Mildred goes into detail to share how her husband was laid-off, how and why she spoiled her daughters, and her husbands philandering. She also shares how she became a successful businesswoman, and how her success continued to grow.  Besides the success, Mildred also tells of her misfortunes such as losing both of her daughters.  It is within the story of her daughters where the poignant tragedy emerges, as she shares with the Chief Inspector how she neglected and spoiled them.  It is a guilt-ridden tale that sobs out Mildred's mouth; however, the audience cannot help to empathize with her while also seeing how she feels guilty.How damaging affection can actually be if not properly managed emerges through Mildred's relationship to her oldest daughter Veda (Ann Blyth).  Mildred's sense of responsibility seems overwhelming, as she always attempts to provide for Veda.  In the process, Veda gets a skewed sense of reality; as she always is sheltered by her mother and never gets to test her own wings.  Mildred is naturally to blame for Veda's blemishes.  However, the child also needs to learn the responsibility of ones own actions as an adult, which is a lesson that Mildred learns in a most profound manner.Mildred Pierce, as a film, employs a brilliant adapted narrative that encourages the audience to contemplate the actions of the main character.  It also allows the viewer to contemplate on personal improvement while it provides a fascinatingly dark thriller.  The camerawork and the mise-en-scene help bring out the oppressive and shadowy elements of film noir, which compels the story to feel even more intriguing.  On top of this, the cast performs radiantly with Joan Crawford and Ann Blyth providing dazzling performances.  Michael Curtiz's direction pulls it all together into a stunningly captivating story that keeps the audience in suspense and questioning the choices of Mildred Pierce.",5,Brilliantly Adapted Novel

In fact, having just read the book and just seen the movie, I'd have to say that this is a rather corny flick in a number of ways, and nowhere near as fine as Cain's superlative novel.There are indeed a number of fine performances here---Blyth, Arden, and Carson all deliver the goods---but even then only Carson comes close to drawing his character as finely as Cain does. Blyth is suitably painful but not as sharp as the truly hateful Veda in the book, and Arden's perfect foil to Crawford gets a mere few minutes here instead of the major part the novel gives to Ida. Sure, the book isn't hampered by a two-hour limit, but there are some choices made by the three screenwriters (including William Faulkner, a long way from Yoknapatawpha here) that just don't make much sense compared to Cain's original and much less Hollywood plot.{Spoilers aplenty on the way:} For instance, the ending is laughable next to the book's. Here of course we must have some sort of ""justice"", contrived though it may be, whereas Cain made the completely realistic yet ugly choice of Veda getting away with it all. And of course the murder is the central plot device of the film, yet nobody is killed in the book, much to the benefit of both plot and characters. The murder here takes away from much of the power of the original plot, and as far as film noir murders go, it's weak. And calling this one of the great film noirs is way off the mark: The Falcon, Double Indemnity, The Big Sleep, DOA and so many others are real noir with real grit; this is all too Hollywood and really not very noir at all, with its slick ending and refusal to confront most of the moral questions raised by Cain. It may be shot with noirish angles and lighting, but that doesn't make it hardboiled. In fact, of the three Cain novels put to film in the '40s, this is the least successful to my eyes and ears; Indemnity and Postman both feature sharper dialogue and better lead performances than Pierce.Uh oh, now I'm getting close to saying what seems to be anathema to the many worshippers of this film, which I tried to deny to myself for a while while rewatching it tonight for the first time in over a decade: Joan Crawford is a mediocre actress. There, I said it. Sorry, but she's wearing almost the same expression in every scene here: eyes wide open in shock/dismay/anger/joy/insert emotion here. Watch Arden and Crawford at work and then watch Joan: they bring subtlety and nuance to their portrayals, where Joan brings only an almost robotic feel to bear on myriad emotions. But then it seemed like she was more concerned with which hat to wear than how to honor Cain's incredibly complex Mildred with a similarly considered performance.She just hams it up over and over, or does the opposite, standing in blank dismay and letting her wardrobe do the acting. Curtiz' fine direction and Steiner's typically solid score lift the film onto a refined plane, and Crawford is in her way perfect here in her many imperfections; she has presence, to be sure, but she's just not a very convincing actress. Cain's Mildred has so much more intelligence and drive and verve and grace and wit than Crawford can begin to bring to this role, and that made it all feel rather empty for me.But I know that leaves me in the vast minority, so maybe I'm just missing her genius. Still, I'd recommend reading the book and then seeing this again to all who find Joan the perfect Mildred Pierce. I think in fact that Arden could have done a vastly superior job as Mildred; she can really act, while Joan can really only be Joan. And while that's a spectacle worth watching, it comes nowhere near the quality of Cain's heroine.The dvd does feature an excellent transfer, plus a decent doc on Crawford's life, and is wisely two-sided, which was common a few years ago until studios realized they could use two discs instead and milk the consumer for more cash. It's a nice little package and must be a delight for huge fans of this film; I too would have called myself one until reading the book. I still like the movie for its various qualities, but can't ignore its many flaws when held up to Cain's masterpiece.",4,"Good movie, great book",1270944000,"04 11, 2010",2010,4277,"['liked', 'film', 'lot', 'more', 'read', 'Cain', 'book', 'subtle', 'ironic', 'ways', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'match', 'fact', 'having', 'just', 'read', 'book', 'just', 'seen', 'movie', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'rather', 'corny', 'flick', 'number', 'ways', 'nowhere', 'near', 'as', 'fine', 'Cain', 'superlative', 'novel.There', 'are', 'indeed', 'number', 'fine', 'performances', 'here', '-Blyth', 'Arden', 'Carson', 'deliver', 'goods', '-but', 'even', 'then', 'only', 'Carson', 'close', 'drawing', 'character', 'as', 'finely', 'Cain', 'Blyth', 'suitably', 'painful', 'not', 'as', 'sharp', 'truly', 'hateful', 'Veda', 'book', 'Arden', 'perfect', 'foil', 'Crawford', 'mere', 'few', 'minutes', 'here', 'instead', 'major', 'part', 'novel', 'Ida', 'Sure', 'book', ""n't"", 'hampered', 'two-hour', 'limit', 'are', 'choices', 'made', 'three', 'screenwriters', 'including', 'William', 'Faulkner', 'long', 'way', 'Yoknapatawpha', 'here', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'compared', 'Cain', 'original', 'much', 'less', 'Hollywood', 'plot', 'Spoilers', 'aplenty', 'way', 'instance', 'ending', 'laughable', 'next', 'book', 'Here', 'course', 'must', 'have', 'sort', 'justice', 'contrived', 'may', 'be', 'whereas', 'Cain', 'made', 'completely', 'realistic', 'yet', 'ugly', 'choice', 'Veda', 'getting', 'away', 'course', 'murder', 'central', 'plot', 'device', 'film', 'nobody', 'killed', 'book', 'much', 'benefit', 'plot', 'characters', 'murder', 'here', 'away', 'much', 'power', 'original', 'plot', 'as', 'far', 'film', 'noir', 'murders', 'go', 'weak', 'calling', 'one', 'great', 'film', 'noirs', 'way', 'mark', 'Falcon', 'Double', 'Indemnity', 'Big', 'Sleep', 'DOA', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'are', 'real', 'real', 'grit', 'too', 'Hollywood', 'really', 'not', 'very', 'noir', 'slick', 'ending', 'refusal', 'confront', 'most', 'moral', 'questions', 'raised', 'Cain', 'may', 'be', 'shot', 'noirish', 'angles', 'lighting', ""n't"", 'make', 'hardboiled', 'fact', 'three', 'Cain', 'novels', 'put', 'film', ""'40s"", 'least', 'successful', 'eyes', 'ears', 'Indemnity', 'Postman', 'feature', 'sharper', 'dialogue', 'better', 'lead', 'performances', 'Pierce.Uh', 'oh', 'now', ""'m"", 'getting', 'close', 'saying', 'what', 'be', 'anathema', 'many', 'worshippers', 'film', 'tried', 'deny', 'myself', 'while', 'rewatching', 'tonight', 'first', 'time', 'decade', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'mediocre', 'actress', 'said', 'Sorry', 'wearing', 'almost', 'same', 'expression', 'scene', 'here', 'eyes', 'wide', 'open', 'shock/dismay/anger/joy/insert', 'emotion', 'here', 'Watch', 'Arden', 'Crawford', 'work', 'then', 'watch', 'Joan', 'bring', 'subtlety', 'nuance', 'portrayals', 'where', 'Joan', 'only', 'almost', 'robotic', 'feel', 'bear', 'myriad', 'emotions', 'then', 'seemed', 'was', 'more', 'concerned', 'hat', 'wear', 'how', 'honor', 'Cain', 'incredibly', 'complex', 'Mildred', 'similarly', 'considered', 'performance.She', 'just', 'up', 'opposite', 'standing', 'blank', 'dismay', 'letting', 'wardrobe', 'do', 'acting', 'Curtiz', 'fine', 'direction', 'Steiner', 'typically', 'solid', 'score', 'film', 'refined', 'plane', 'Crawford', 'way', 'perfect', 'here', 'many', 'imperfections', 'presence', 'be', 'sure', 'just', 'not', 'very', 'convincing', 'actress', 'Cain', 'Mildred', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'intelligence', 'drive', 'verve', 'grace', 'wit', 'Crawford', 'can', 'begin', 'bring', 'role', 'made', 'feel', 'rather', 'empty', 'me.But', 'know', 'vast', 'minority', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'just', 'missing', 'genius', 'Still', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'reading', 'book', 'then', 'seeing', 'again', 'who', 'find', 'Joan', 'perfect', 'Mildred', 'Pierce', 'think', 'fact', 'Arden', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'vastly', 'superior', 'job', 'Mildred', 'can', 'really', 'act', 'Joan', 'can', 'really', 'only', 'be', 'Joan', 'spectacle', 'worth', 'watching', 'nowhere', 'quality', 'Cain', 'heroine.The', 'dvd', 'feature', 'excellent', 'transfer', 'decent', 'doc', 'Crawford', 'life', 'wisely', 'two-sided', 'was', 'common', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'studios', 'realized', 'could', 'use', 'two', 'discs', 'instead', 'milk', 'consumer', 'more', 'cash', 'nice', 'little', 'package', 'must', 'be', 'delight', 'huge', 'fans', 'film', 'too', 'would', 'have', 'called', 'one', 'reading', 'book', 'still', 'movie', 'various', 'qualities', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ignore', 'many', 'flaws', 'when', 'held', 'up', 'Cain', 'masterpiece']",N/A

Cain) and photographed in moody black and white by ace cameraman Ernest Haller (HUMORESQUE, REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE). Aimed at the market for so-called 'women's pictures' which had emerged during the Second World War, the movie contains all the ingredients of a modern day soap opera, piling the agony on Crawford's tragic character until she's redeemed by a moment of happiness at the very end of the picture.Crawford is a tower of strength in the leading role, and she's given strong support by an exceptional cast, including Blyth (KISMET, THE HELEN MORGAN STORY) as her vicious, mean-spirited offspring, character actor Jack Carson as a wily businessman who pursues Crawford romantically and loses out to a succession of unsuitable paramours (including a deceptively suave Zachary Scott in one of his first screen appearances), and Eve Arden in a hilarious turn as Crawford's friend and business colleague who doles out the wisecracks like candy (after being leered over by Carson, she retorts: ""Leave SOMETHING on me, I might catch cold!""). Attentive viewers will be amused by some eyebrow-raising dialogue which hints at a lesbian subtext in Arden's character, having somehow managed to elude conservative-minded censors in 1945!By this stage in his long career, director Michael Curtiz was an old hand at this sort of thing (ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES, CASABLANCA, etc.), and he orchestrates the dramatic highlights with visual aplomb - the confrontations between Crawford and Blyth are particularly strong, though Crawford's stubborn devotion to such an ungrateful daughter seems faintly ridiculous at times - and the sumptuous production values represent Hollywood craftsmanship at its finest. Beautiful, doom-laden score by Max Steiner, incorporating a number of cues heard earlier in NOW, VOYAGER (1942), and vivid, expressionist set designs by Hollywood veteran Anton Grot.

144862,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,0792840054,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[1, 1]","I always greatly loved this film, even if it is really a terribly sad thing. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.A man is shot numerous times and falls on the floor. He just has the time to say ""Mildred"" before dying. Soon after a deeply shocked, but firmly resolved beautiful woman named Mildred Pierce (Joan Crawford) lures to the place of crime a certain Wally Fay (Jack Carson), a man who tried to seduce her many times in the past - and there she attempts to frame him for the murder of the man we saw dying earlier... Later, in the the police station, Mildred Pierce must explain to very inquisitive detectives her relations with both the dead man and Wally Fay - and that means we are going back in time, many years earlier, to listen to the story of her life...This movie is sometimes considered as a ""film noir"" - but even if the beginning seems borrowed from this genre, this is in fact  a very powerful - and surprisingly feminist in the best meaning of this term - social drama, with just a little touch of crime. This is the life story of a woman who in her young years was happy, cheerful and trusting - but then was betrayed, abandoned and left destitute... But far from succumbing she rose again and with courage, wits and iron will she towered over lesser people - before being betrayed and backstabbed in an even more cruel way again and again and again - and again...The novel ""Mildred Pierce"" published in 1941 by James McCain was a most excellent thing (this same author wrote the novels which gave us ""The postman always rings twice"" and ""Double Indemnity"") but for the needs of cinema was even upgraded, including even a contribution by no lesser a writer than William Faulkner! Therefore it is hardly surprising, that this story is very powerful - in fact with just a minimum of imagnation one could imagine that it was written by Shakespeare or Balzac and therefore alternate titles could be ""Queen Lear"" or ""Mere Goriot""...Joan Crawford very deservedly won the Oscar of the Best Actress for her role in this film, but she was greatly assisted by barely 17 years old Ann Blyth who plays brilliantly her older daughter Veda and also by 9 years old child actress Jo Ann Marlowe who plays her younger daughter Kay. Eve Arden is brilliant as her best friend Ida Corwin, a tough and cynical but very brilliant and ultimately rather likeable gal. Actors Jack Carson, Zachary Scott and Bruce Bennett, mostly forgotten nowadays, play excellently the three men who were part of Mildred's Pierce life - frequently with devastating results.I was also delighted to see (and especially HEAR!) black actress Butterfly McQueen who plays Lottie, a maid working in Mildred's Pierce house (later mansion) - she is here as delightful as in ""Gone with the wind"", where she portrayed Prissy, the harebrained Scarlett's servant.Director Michael Curtiz, today mostly remembered for the legendary ""Casablanca"", was at that time already a Hollywood veteran as he made his first film already in 1912 when still living in Hungary - born Kertesz Kaminer Mano in Budapest in 1886 he first used the name Michael Kertesz before changing it to Michael Curtiz after emigrating to United States.Those 33 years of experience are well visible on the screen as not only the actors are led with great mastery but the scenery is also magnificent - I was particularly impressed by his vision of the police station which in some scenes in this film seems almost to be an ancient temple, where truth will finally by established and justice served...Bottom line, this is an EXCELLENT film which I think never will age at all - EVER! To buy, watch and keep preciously!

When we first meet Mildred she's a beleagured houswife saddled with two daughters and an unfaithful husband. She bakes pies and sells them to the neighbors to make ends meet. When she finally throws her husband out, she gets a job as a waitress. But she has a bigger problem: her oldest daughter, Veda, is an ungrateful little wretch who is never satisfied. Mildred can't do anything right to please her. Mildred finally learns the restaurant business thanks to her friend---the matchless Eve Arden---and opens her own place. But Veda still isn't satisfied so Mildred expands her business into a chain of ""Mildreds'"". The youngest daughter dies and Mildred is devastated but Veda, bless her, is DELIGHTED. She can now have Mother all to herself and milk her for every cent she has. Veda turns into the daughter-from-hell as Mildred becomes a restaurant tycoon. But darker waters lay ahead for Mildred as she goes bankrupt thanks to the no-good playboy she marries for title to further please that worthless little tramp Veda. He even begins fooling around with Veda until she shoots him and tries to get Mildred to take the blame. Of all the rags-to-riches dames Crawford ever played this is the ultimate. Director Michael Curtiz didn't want Crawford for Mildred and humiliated her publicly but Crawford stuck it out and won him over. James M. Cains' novel had to be toned down for the screen but it still ranks as classic film noir and very sticky soap opera. Ann Blyth is mightily impressive as the evil Veda and matches Crawford scene for scene through all their confrontations. The film is a must see for Crawford, Blyth and the wonderful Eve Arden. Carol Burnett even parodied it in a classic sketch on one of her old TV shows.

144865,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,0792840054,Martin Asiner,"[5, 7]","Joan Crawford had been making successful movies since the silent era.  Her early career was full of singing and dancing, rarely showing the edginess that came to mark her later films.  Before she was forced to leave MGM, most often she played roles that demonstrated a lighter touch.  After signing with Warners, the Joan Crawford that most Americans came to know her by became evident.  With MILDRED PIERCE, she shows the quintessential gravitas that later generations came to revere.By 1945, Crawford's career was seen, mistakenly as it turned out, to be in eclipse.  Director Michael Curtiz saw in her the actress who could radiate the same ruthless business sense that marked her business life but was paradoxically absent from that of her personal life.  Just as Jay Gatsby came to symbolize the hollowness of the Jazz Age, so did Mildred do for the new spirit of American woman who had to struggle alone to build a life while their husbands were busy fighting overseas.  Oddly enough, the role of Mildred was first offered to Bette Davis, who unwisely turned it down.  Director Curtiz's instincts about Crawford were squarely on the mark as she went on to win an Oscar for Best Actress, beating out Ingrid Bergman, Greer Garson, and Gene Tierney.  The toughness of the Mildred Pierce from the novel by James Cain is evident in nearly every scene except when Crawford chooses to drop the mask of continuous self-sacrifice to reveal a woman who has been buffeted by one husband who fails to see her essential goodness, a second husband who sees her only as a meal ticket, and a daughter whose nastiness was rivalled only by Bette Davis as slutty Mildren Rogers from OF HUMAN BONDAGE.Crawford is Mildred Pierce,a tough-minded woman, abandoned by her husband (Bruce Bennet) to care for her two young daughters.  The younger of the two dies of pneumonia, forcing Mildred to find work as a waitress.  At this job, she starts at the very bottom of the restaurant totem pole.  The hours are long, her feet are killing her, and the tips are lousy.  But little by little, her life starts to fall into all the right places.  Eve Arden is Ida, the wisecracking manager of the restaurant who first hires her then goes on to steal the show with the acid witticisms that have come to mark her career.  What happens to Mildred is the downside of the American Dream that dictates that hard work, gumption, and feistiness lead to financial success.  Mildred quickly learns the ropes of How to Make a Buck.  She finds her success but at the cost of gaining an unscrupulous husband (Zachary Scott) while losing her remaining daughter Veda (Ann Blythe), whose ingratitude and moral sleaziness are immortalized in her parting lines to Mildred: 'I hate the smell of grease in your kitchen and on you.'  With the non-stop complaints of the harridan-like Veda, she succeeds in coming across as the fun-loving flapper of a previous generation who finds out to her dismay that when the partying is over, she is expected to clean up her own mess.  Veda and Mildred's new husband are the perfect pair: flashy on the outside, empty on the inside, and determined to climb the ladder of success on the other's respective back.The joy of watching MILDRED PIERCE is not just from seeing how well Crawford claws her way to success while trying all the while to have the personal life that her business life seems bent on withholding.  It also resides in the way the supporting cast bounces off each other at just the right pitch and the right moment.  One of the film's central ironies is that the man who abandons her at the film's start (Bennet) stands revealed as the only one of Mildred's inner circle who remains loyal by the closing credits.  Mildred, like Gatsby, learns a brutal truth about that tough climb up the ladder: wealth earned at the cost of losing one's family is a bleakly inadequate substitute for that loss.  Gatsby never had a chance to learn this.  Mildred did.",5,Mildred as Gatsby,1056240000,"06 22, 2003",2003,3956,"['Joan', 'Crawford', 'had', 'been', 'making', 'successful', 'movies', 'silent', 'era', 'early', 'career', 'was', 'full', 'singing', 'dancing', 'rarely', 'showing', 'edginess', 'came', 'mark', 'later', 'films', 'was', 'forced', 'leave', 'MGM', 'most', 'often', 'played', 'roles', 'demonstrated', 'lighter', 'touch', 'signing', 'Warners', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'most', 'Americans', 'came', 'know', 'became', 'evident', 'MILDRED', 'PIERCE', 'quintessential', 'gravitas', 'later', 'generations', 'came', 'revere.By', '1945', 'Crawford', 'career', 'was', 'seen', 'mistakenly', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'eclipse', 'Director', 'Michael', 'Curtiz', 'saw', 'actress', 'who', 'could', 'radiate', 'same', 'ruthless', 'business', 'sense', 'marked', 'business', 'life', 'was', 'paradoxically', 'absent', 'personal', 'life', 'Just', 'Jay', 'Gatsby', 'came', 'symbolize', 'hollowness', 'Jazz', 'Age', 'so', 'did', 'Mildred', 'do', 'new', 'spirit', 'American', 'woman', 'who', 'had', 'struggle', 'alone', 'build', 'life', 'husbands', 'were', 'busy', 'fighting', 'overseas', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'role', 'Mildred', 'was', 'first', 'offered', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'who', 'unwisely', 'turned', 'down', 'Director', 'Curtiz', 'instincts', 'Crawford', 'were', 'squarely', 'mark', 'went', 'win', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Actress', 'beating', 'out', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman', 'Greer', 'Garson', 'Gene', 'Tierney', 'toughness', 'Mildred', 'Pierce', 'novel', 'James', 'Cain', 'evident', 'nearly', 'scene', 'when', 'Crawford', 'drop', 'mask', 'continuous', 'self-sacrifice', 'reveal', 'woman', 'who', 'been', 'buffeted', 'one', 'husband', 'who', 'see', 'essential', 'goodness', 'second', 'husband', 'who', 'only', 'meal', 'ticket', 'daughter', 'nastiness', 'was', 'rivalled', 'only', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'slutty', 'Mildren', 'Rogers', 'OF', 'HUMAN', 'BONDAGE.Crawford', 'Mildred', 'Pierce', 'tough-minded', 'woman', 'abandoned', 'husband', 'Bruce', 'Bennet', 'care', 'two', 'young', 'daughters', 'younger', 'two', 'dies', 'pneumonia', 'forcing', 'Mildred', 'find', 'work', 'waitress', 'job', 'very', 'bottom', 'restaurant', 'totem', 'pole', 'hours', 'are', 'long', 'feet', 'are', 'killing', 'tips', 'are', 'lousy', 'little', 'little', 'life', 'fall', 'right', 'places', 'Eve', 'Arden', 'Ida', 'wisecracking', 'manager', 'restaurant', 'who', 'first', 'then', 'steal', 'show', 'acid', 'witticisms', 'have', 'come', 'mark', 'career', 'What', 'Mildred', 'downside', 'American', 'Dream', 'hard', 'work', 'gumption', 'feistiness', 'lead', 'financial', 'success', 'Mildred', 'quickly', 'ropes', 'How', 'Make', 'Buck', 'success', 'cost', 'gaining', 'unscrupulous', 'husband', 'Zachary', 'Scott', 'losing', 'remaining', 'daughter', 'Veda', 'Ann', 'Blythe', 'ingratitude', 'moral', 'sleaziness', 'are', 'immortalized', 'parting', 'lines', 'Mildred', 'hate', 'smell', 'grease', 'kitchen', 'non-stop', 'complaints', 'harridan-like', 'Veda', 'coming', 'fun-loving', 'flapper', 'previous', 'generation', 'who', 'out', 'dismay', 'when', 'partying', 'expected', 'clean', 'up', 'own', 'mess', 'Veda', 'Mildred', 'new', 'husband', 'are', 'perfect', 'pair', 'flashy', 'outside', 'empty', 'inside', 'determined', 'climb', 'ladder', 'success', 'other', 'respective', 'back.The', 'joy', 'watching', 'MILDRED', 'PIERCE', 'not', 'just', 'seeing', 'how', 'well', 'Crawford', 'way', 'success', 'trying', 'while', 'have', 'personal', 'life', 'business', 'life', 'bent', 'withholding', 'also', 'way', 'supporting', 'cast', 'bounces', 'off', 'other', 'just', 'right', 'pitch', 'right', 'moment', 'One', 'film', 'central', 'ironies', 'man', 'who', 'film', 'start', 'Bennet', 'revealed', 'only', 'one', 'Mildred', 'inner', 'circle', 'who', 'loyal', 'closing', 'credits', 'Mildred', 'Gatsby', 'brutal', 'truth', 'tough', 'climb', 'ladder', 'wealth', 'earned', 'cost', 'losing', 'one', 'family', 'bleakly', 'inadequate', 'substitute', 'loss', 'Gatsby', 'never', 'had', 'chance', 'learn', 'Mildred', 'did']",N/A

This movie is truly one of the finest made in the history of American cinema. Joan Crawford plays the title role, a woman who does what she can to succeed in her life. Mildred is married to a guy who gave her two daughters, Veda and Kay. Her husband, Bert, has an affair with another woman, and Mildred goes about getting a divorce. Meanwhile, Mildred ends up with a pile of unpaid bills, and that she must get herself a job in order to keep things going for herself and her daughters. As Mildred is at the police station regarding the murder of her second husband (the one who fell in love with Veda), she describes her story of trying to get a job.Everywhere she went looking for a job, she was told that ""they were looking for someone with experience"". Finally, about to give up, she ends up going to a restaurant for a break from her job search (after seeing a ""Help Wanted"" sign in the window). This is where we first see Ida (Eve Arden), who is dealing with waitresses arguing over who's been taking whose tips, etc. Mildred says she wants a job, Ida asks if she ever worked in a restaurant before, Mildred says no, so Ida takes her to the back, and issues a uniform and fills her in about the uniform, etc. Mildred then tells that within a while, she becomes an excellent waitress, and is so successful, she ends up opening up a chain of her own eateries.Veda is the character whom lots of viewers love to hate, because she is so unappreciative of the things Mildred gets and does for her. The story goes on and on to a certain extent, so I won't bore anyone with the excesses.I feel that this movie is one that must be in everyone's movie library.

Like several of film noir's most famous examples, ""Double Indemnity"" among them, ""Mildred Pierce"" is based on a novel by James M. Cain. In this case, the novel was adapted by Ranald MacDougall, with some uncredited assistance from William Faulkner. As the film opens, Mildred Pierce (Joan Crawford), a sophisticated woman, obviously distraught, makes an apparent attempt to frame a business associate for her husband's murder. She is taken to the police station, where she recounts the events of the past few years to an investigating officer. We see, in flashback, her split from her first husband, her preoccupation with providing an aristocratic lifestyle for her eldest daughter, her business success, and eventual marriage to her now-deceased second husband.""Mildred Pierce"" was Joan Crawford's first film for Warner Bros. Studios, after a pronounced lull in her career. Crawford's depiction of Pierce's ambition and pathological indulgence of her spoiled, selfish daughter Veda (Ann Blyth) is extraordinary. She makes Mildred Pierce one of the most thoroughly captivating characters ever to grace the screen. Crawford's performance is so fascinating that it might be easy to overlook the film's supporting performances. But ""Mildred Pierce"" wouldn't have been so great a success without the strong, sometimes slimy, characters that surround Mildred. Ann Blyth's performance as Veda Pierce, Zachary Scott's as rakish second husband Monty Baragon, Eve Arden (who earned an Academy Award nomination) as business manager Ida, and Jack Carson as businessman Wally Fay are all unforgettable in themselves. Truly exceptional performances, writing, and direction by Michael Curtiz (of ""Casablanca"" fame) make ""Mildred Pierce"" a must-see if there ever was one.The DVD: The flip side of the disc contains an hour-and-a-half long documentary entitled ""Joan Crawford: The Ultimate Movie Star"", produced by Turner Classic Movies.

After leaving MGM, Joan Crawford found a new studio and greater respect for her talents over at W.B.  She also took home the Best Actress Oscar for this flick.  Crawford is Mildred, a struggling single mom who has to battle a cut-throat business partner, philandering boyfriend and ungrateful child in this classic film noir who done it. About the transfer: Warner has taken great pains to restore both the picture and sound elements and their attention to detail shows.  The visuals are glorious, sharp and in pristine condition. Close ups reveal actor's make up and fine detail in the fabric of their costumes - the transfer is that good!  Included on side two is a heartbreaking documentary about the star that perhaps reveals more than one side to &quot;Mommy Dearest&quot;.

The movie is not completely true to  Cain's novel, but I find it far better.Mildred (Crawford) is a lower-class woman who dreams and schemes of attaining a higher status in life for her children.  Mildred separates from her unemployed husband.  Using hard work and some sexual perseverance, she opens a chain of restaurants and raises her financial status substantially.  Her spoiled teenaged daughter, Vida (Ann Blyth), wants even more, including Mildred's current playboy paramour/ future husband, Monte.  Mildred is so blinded by the sudden death of her youngest and sweetest child, that she continues to push harder and harder to please and win the ungrateful and spoiled Vida.  No amount of material wealth and hard work by Mildred seems to be respectable enough for Vida.Vida's conniving scheme to wed an unsuspecting, naive, rich boy for his money pushes Mother and daughter even farther apart in a violent argument.  So with no income, Vida winds up singing (scantily clad) in a ""dive"" bar on the waterfront.  (This seems rather of out of place, considering Vida's snobbish attitudes).  But it still makes for great, sleazy, melodrama.Poor Mildred just cannot stop trying to regain the love of Vida. She buys Monte's (now in debt) mansion, marries him, and redecorates the joint just to please her daughter.  Then invites Vida back ""home.""But the movie began with a murder and is told in flash-back. So, Who dunnit?  Vida? Mildred? Vida's father? Or Mildred's con-artist investor/advisor (Jack Carson)?  and where will Mildred end up after all of the drama?Crawford won an Academy Award for her aggressive, tough, and hard-edged ""scenery chewing"".  I also enjoyed the performance by Eve Arden, as Mildred's friend and partner in the restaurants.  As a ""strong woman"" in a small role, she coldly and sarcastically tells the shocked, prissy tax auditor, ""Come here and let me bite you, darling boy!""

You've got the drama of the loss of a child which shifts all the parenting focus onto the one remaining child. You can tell early on that the daughter is ashamed of her mother. Unfortunately, the shame and ungratefulness grow exponentially with the hard work and tough choices the mother has had to make. There are some things a mother wants and believes she will receive if she is a good mother:  to be loved, respected, admired, and appreciated by their daughter. But no matter how hard the mother tries, no matter how hard she works, and whatever personal sacrifices she makes; her child may not recognize the fine mother she has been given.

144888,A21VR7M8O55EF6,0792840054,Robin Friedman,"[2, 3]","Among the many cultural resources of the Washington D.C. area is the American Film Institute Silver which is in the middle of its annual retrospective of classic noir films called ""Noir City D.C: the 2011 Film Noir Festival"". The Festival is presenting 18 movies over a two week period, including ""Mildred Pierce"" the 1945 film starring Joan  Crawford. Crawford received the Academy Award for best actress for her portrayal of the title character. I saw the film in the AFI's large, period style ornate and upholstered 400 seat theater on a rainy afternoon. I find this a much more appealing way to view a classic film than watching a DVD.I wanted to see this movie because I read not long ago the novel on which it is based, Mildred Pierce (1941) by James M. Cain.Mildred Pierce (Movie Tie-in Edition  Vintage Crime/Black Lizard)Cain's novel and the movie were great popular successes when released, but the novel for a time drifted into obscurity. Then in 2011, HBO presented a mini-series of Mildred Pierce which I have not seen.  With the movie and HBO adaptation, Cain's novel gained additional attention. I think the book is an important work of American literature, as evidenced, among other ways, by the adaptations.Cain was a tough, hardboiled writer of noir. His novel, Mildred Pierce, is unique in the noir genre because its primary character is a woman and because the emphasis of the book is on understanding a complex individual. Most noir, movie or novel, does not delve deeply into character and still fewer works develop a female character. Unlike most noir, there is no murder in Cain's novel and no detective as a main character.Directed by Michael Curtiz and with dramatic music by Max Steiner, the movie changes Cain's story in many respects, primarily by opening the book with the murder of one of the main characters, a once wealty ne'r do well named Monte Baragon (Zachary Scott) who was Mildred's second husband.  Mildred is brought in for questioning and relates her story to the detective in the process of finding the murderer.  The story Mildred relates loosely tracks Cain's novel, again with several differences.  Character development is not emphasized nearly as fully in the movie as in the book. The movie becomes instead a fast-paced melodrama. It is something of a tear jerker in addition to noir.This is still an outstanding movie faithful in broad outline to Cain's book. In its portrayal of Depression era Los Angeles, the movie captures a great deal of the spirit of noir. The black and white photography and the shaded lighting add a great deal to the tension of the film.  The dialogue is short and clipped. Mildred Pierce in book and movie is a story of class conflict, greed, lust, betrayal, and ingratitude.  Mildred separates from her first husband Albert (Bruce Bennett) with little in the way of skills to support herself and her two daughters.  She secures a poorly paid job as a waitress in a hash house and rises to own a chain of restaurants called ""Mildred's"".  The death of her younger daughter and troubles with men bring Mildred sorrow.  But the focus of the book is on Mildred's relationship with her scheming, evil and jealous older daughter, Veda, (Ann Blyth). The portrayal of Veda in the movie is much sharper and less nuanced than in Cain's novel.This film version of Mildred Pierce is included in a reference work on film titled ""1001 Movies to See before you Die"".1001 Movies You Must See Before You DieHere is a portion of the book's description of the movie.""A definitive 1940's women's picture and a seething domestic soap opera, {Mildred Pierce]... is also a superbly nasty noir, one that plays havoc with the era's ideals of maternal devotion and mom's apple pie.  Mildred is admirable for her hard work and self-sacrifice. She is smart, ambitious, and driven, qualities respected and rewarded in the American ethic.  But gradually as she detaches from her decent but unsuccessful husband.... and as she favors the insolent Vera over her sweeter younger daughter, putting the child's death behind her with no evident afterthought, we begin to sesne an unhealthy, even pathological, aspect to Mildred's compulsion.  Throbbing melodrama does not come with more conviction."" (p. 202)Mildred Pierce would not be mistaken for a modern film about an independent career woman. Crawford's role is smoldering and her attentions are invariably taken and sought by men.  Yet Mildred's character is strongly portrayed.  The film shows her desire to make something of her life and to give her daughter the advantages Mildred herself lacked. Mildred is her own person in this movie rather than only the love interest of a male character. Mildred remains the heroine in this movie, albeit a sad, broken heroine.There sometimes is a tendency to downgrade products of American popular culture, whether in the forms of books or movies. Cain's novel will survive the pejorative terms of ""pulp"" or ""trash"" that it on occasion received. So too, the film, and Joan Crawford's acting will reward watching.  I was grateful to see this movie as part of a noir retrospective in a beautiful theater where it rightfully belongs.Robin Friedman",5,Women and Noir,1318982400,"10 19, 2011",2011,5183,"['many',

This is Crawford at her best, with a sharp, vicious script that only could have been conceived in Film Noir heaven.The story is told in flashback, with the movie beginning with a murder - - we will shortly know who the victim is but the murderer will only be revealed at the conclusion.  Crawford plays the title character, a thirty-something woman who married her husband Bert at 18, had daughters Veda and Kay and seems to ""always have been in the kitchen"".  Unemployed Bert has been seeing Mrs. Biederhof and so Mildred throws him out.  In order to bring money into the household, Mildred gets a job waiting tables, which within several months leads to her starting her own restaurant.  With the help of realtor Wally Fay, played with shifty aplomb by Jack Carson, and former rich boy Monte Baragon, played sleekly by Zachary Scott, who is having a closeout sale on his family's various properties, Mildred becomes the Martha Stewart businesswoman of her day.  However, none of it is good enough to win the approval of her spoiled, selfish daughter Veda.  In an effort to provide Veda with the lifestyle to which she so earnestly desires, Mildred, now divorced from Bert, marries Monte, whom she doesn't love but who has the family name and pedigree to give Veda status.  However, money (and pedigree) does not buy happiness and instead of the happy family portrait, there is a murder.Crawford won a richly deserved Oscar for her turn here and no matter how many times you watch this film, you are bound to be impressed by her.  Her acting is subtle, superb and her emotions seem genuine and heartfelt.  Angelic looking Ann Blyth as the bitchy daughter Veda makes you think, as Eve Arden's Ida quotes, ""alligators have the right idea, they eat their young.""  Eve Arden gives comic relief with her witty repartee and Michael Curtiz gets the best performances out of each and every member of the cast.Watch this film and you will wonder how Crawford was considered Box Office Poison just a few short years earlier and how the Academy overlooked her.

After MGM dumped her in the early forties citing she was ""boxoffice poison"", Warner Brothers signed Crawford to star in this potboiler about a woman who sacrifices everything to please her selfish, ungrateful child and to give her everything money can buy. Director Michael Curtiz didn't want Joan. He felt her shoulder pads and her stiff acting wasn't what was warranted for the role of Mildred. He actually wanted Babara Stanwyck, who turned the role down citing she could never play opposite a character as evil as the daughter Veda. After having a screen test (an embarrassement to Crawford after she had been in films for over 18 years) Curtiz was blown away by Crawford's performance. In one scene during preproduction Joan waited for Curtiz to yell ""cut, cut"", but didn't hear anything. She then looked over to the director's chair and noticed Curtiz crying. He told her, ""I love you baby...you've got the part"". ""Mildred Pierce"" is one of the best films from the 1940's, soap operish at best, but flawless in its cinematography and performances. It's also one of the best in the film noir series that shows a lot of shadows in its scenes, a common occurrence in french films that was brought to American movie making. The highlight to this DVD is also an informative documentary produced by Turner Broadcasting on Joan Crawford called ""Always The Star"", featuring interviews with many people who knew Crawford, including Betsy Palmer (her co-star in ""Queen Bee""), Christina Crawford (Joan's daughter and author of ""Mommie Dearest""), Vincent Sherman (former lover and director), and more.

144903,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,0792840054,Turfseer,"[1, 1]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***For those who believe that films must remain 'faithful' to their source material should take a look at the original 1945 film version of 'Mildred Pierce'; it's an example of the 'right' way to adapt a novel into a screenplay. Contrast it with the turgid, long-winded 2011 HBO version of 'Pierce'. There's actually no comparison: the 1945 version is wholly entertaining while the recent adaptation will bore you to tears.Mildred Pierce was the perfect vehicle for Joan Crawford. Ironically here she plays a mother whose love is pretty much unconditional toward her bad seed daughter Veda (in real life, however, Crawford used 'tough love' on her own children with disastrous results). Unlike the novel (and the recent HBO Version), the noirish murder scene constitutes the inciting incident and linchpin of the entire plot.The break into the Second Act begins during the police interrogation as Mildred recounts her break up with husband Bert and quest for financial independence. When a waitress is fired during an argument with another waitress over tips, Mildred just happens to be in the right place at the right time and is hired on the spot. It's these neat little scenes that add to the overall verisimilitude of the plot.Act two introduces us to Mildred's conflict with Wally, Bert's former real estate partner and daughter Veda. As for Wally--he's distinctively played by Jack Carson as the seedy salesman who can't resist trying to putting his paws all over Mildred (he's a serial groper!). Ann Blyth is brilliant, making the most of the chief supporting players' part, as the evil Veda. The character is so over the top that one can scarcely believe there are people like this in real life. Veda can't control her contempt for her mother and yes teenagers often do rebel against parental authority; but the disdain is usually a lot more subtle than what we see here. Still, Veda's exaggerated (and escalating) misbehavior is what makes the film so enjoyable (there is a catharsis of sorts as the audience gets to 'hiss the villain').If there is one sentimental sequence 'Mildred Pierce', it's when younger daughter Ray contracts pneumonia and dies. The scene is a bit drawn out but provides an explanation for Mildred's continuing attachment to Veda--the loss of Ray causes Mildred to try and protect the only child she has left!The stakes get higher in Act 2. Monte is temporarily thrown 'under the bus' when he refuses Mildred's request not to indulge Veda and stay away from her. Then Veda goes ahead and cons her new husband and his mother out of $10,000 by pretending that she's pregnant. There's that great iconic scene where Veda ends up slapping Mildred and she throws her out of the house. Meanwhile, Mildred finds success in the restaurant business by opening up a chain of restaurants. Should I mention that Mildred's former supervisor Ida (deliciously played by Eve Arden) is the comic relief with her sassy comments about men. Leave it to kind-hearted Bert (who finally has gotten his act together), to bring Veda and Mildred back together. This happens when he brings Mildred to a seedy nightclub where Veda now works as a low rent singer.The dark moment of Act 2 occurs after Mildred agrees to marry Monte and give him one third of the business (she does this to perhaps improve her social standing in Veda's eyes). Monte betrays Mildred by selling his share of the business along with Wally, which bankrupts her. The ultimate indignity of course is that Monte begins an affair with Veda.What makes Mildred Pierce so engaging is that not only is Veda damaged goods but so is Mildred. She's willing to send an innocent man to jail to save her daughter when she tries to set up Wally as the killer.Note that the story is not without a few false notes. How can the police arrest Bert at the beginning of the film? Yes, they have his gun and no denial that he was responsible; but they don't actually have a confession, so the evidence seems rather flimsy. Then there's the ending itself--the murder feels a bit tacked on as if the screenwriter couldn't come up with something more creative and needed to rush things to an almost immediate conclusion. It's really not much of a twist ending as Monte's murder seems rather predictable.Despite the minor pitfalls, 'Mildred Pierce' remains a highly entertaining part noir, part soap opera, that manages to thrill audiences even to this day.",4,Mother's unconditional love can't save bad seed offspring!,1303084800,"04 18, 2011",2011,4448,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***For', 'who', 'believe', 'films', 'must', 'remain', ""'faithful"", 'source', 'material', 'should', 'take', 'look', 'original', '1945', 'film', 'version', ""'Mildred"", 'Pierce', 'example', ""'right"", 'way', 'adapt', 'novel', 'screenplay', 'Contrast', 'turgid', 'long-winded', '2011', 'HBO', 'version', ""'Pierce"", 'actually', 'comparison', '1945', 'version', 'wholly', 'entertaining', 'recent', 'adaptation', 'will', 'bore', 'tears.Mildred', 'Pierce', 'was', 'perfect', 'vehicle', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'Ironically', 'here', 'mother', 'love', 'pretty', 'much', 'unconditional', 'bad', 'seed', 'daughter', 'Veda', 'real', 'life', 'however', 'Crawford', 'used', 'love', 'own', 'children', 'disastrous', 'results', 'novel', 'recent', 'HBO', 'Version', 'noirish', 'murder', 'scene', 'inciting', 'incident', 'linchpin', 'entire', 'plot.The', 'break', 'Second', 'Act', 'police', 'interrogation', 'Mildred', 'recounts', 'break', 'up', 'husband', 'Bert', 'quest', 'financial', 'independence', 'When', 'waitress', 'fired', 'argument', 'waitress', 'tips', 'Mildred', 'just', 'be', 'right', 'place', 'right', 'time', 'hired', 'spot', 'neat', 'little', 'scenes', 'add', 'overall', 'verisimilitude', 'plot.Act', 'two', 'introduces', 'Mildred', 'conflict', 'Wally', 'Bert', 'former', 'real', 'estate', 'partner', 'daughter', 'Veda', 'Wally', 'distinctively', 'played', 'Jack', 'Carson', 'seedy', 'salesman', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'resist', 'trying', 'putting', 'paws', 'Mildred', 'serial', 'groper', 'Ann', 'Blyth', 'brilliant', 'making', 'most', 'chief', 'supporting', 'players', 'part', 'evil', 'Veda', 'character', 'so', 'top', 'one', 'can', 'scarcely', 'believe', 'are', 'people', 'real', 'life', 'Veda', 'ca', ""n't"", 'control', 'contempt', 'mother', 'yes', 'teenagers', 'often', 'do', 'rebel', 'parental', 'authority', 'disdain', 'usually', 'lot', 'more', 'subtle', 'what', 'see', 'here', 'Still', 'Veda', 'exaggerated', 'escalating', 'misbehavior', 'what', 'film', 'so', 'enjoyable', 'catharsis', 'sorts', 'audience', ""'hiss"", 'villain', '.If', 'one', 'sentimental', 'sequence', ""'Mildred"", 'Pierce', 'when', 'younger', 'daughter', 'Ray', 'contracts', 'pneumonia', 'dies', 'scene', 'bit', 'drawn', 'out', 'explanation', 'Mildred', 'continuing', 'attachment', 'Veda', 'loss', 'Ray', 'causes', 'Mildred', 'try', 'protect', 'only', 'child', 'left', 'stakes', 'get', 'higher', 'Act', '2', 'Monte', 'temporarily', 'thrown', ""'under"", 'bus', 'when', 'Mildred', 'request', 'not', 'indulge', 'Veda', 'stay', 'away', 'Then', 'Veda', 'ahead', 'cons', 'new', 'husband', 'mother', '10,000', 'pretending', 'pregnant', 'great', 'iconic', 'scene', 'where', 'Veda', 'up', 'slapping', 'Mildred', 'house', 'Meanwhile', 'Mildred', 'success', 'restaurant', 'business', 'opening', 'up', 'chain', 'restaurants', 'Should', 'mention', 'Mildred', 'former', 'supervisor', 'Ida', 'deliciously', 'played', 'Eve', 'Arden', 'comic', 'relief', 'sassy', 'comments', 'men', 'Leave', 'kind-hearted', 'Bert', 'who', 'finally', 'gotten', 'act', 'together', 'bring', 'Veda', 'Mildred', 'back', 'together', 'when', 'Mildred', 'seedy', 'nightclub', 'where', 'Veda', 'now', 'low', 'rent', 'singer.The', 'dark', 'moment', 'Act', '2', 'occurs', 'Mildred', 'marry', 'Monte', 'give', 'one', 'third', 'business', 'perhaps', 'improve', 'social', 'standing', 'Veda', 'eyes', 'Monte', 'betrays', 'Mildred', 'selling', 'share', 'business', 'Wally', 'ultimate', 'indignity', 'course', 'Monte', 'affair', 'Veda.What', 'Mildred', 'Pierce', 'engaging', 'not', 'only', 'Veda', 'damaged', 'goods', 'so', 'Mildred', 'willing', 'send', 'innocent', 'man', 'jail', 'save', 'daughter', 'when', 'set', 'up', 'Wally', 'killer.Note', 'story', 'not', 'few', 'false', 'notes', 'How', 'can', 'police', 'arrest', 'Bert', 'beginning', 'film', 'Yes', 'have', 'gun', 'denial', 'was', 'responsible', 'do', ""n't"", 'actually', 'have', 'confession', 'evidence', 'rather', 'flimsy', 'Then', 'ending', 'murder', 'bit', 'tacked', 'screenwriter', 'could', ""n't"", 'come', 'up', 'something', 'more', 'creative', 'needed', 'rush', 'things', 'almost', 'immediate', 'conclusion', 'really', 'not', 'much', 'twist', 'ending', 'Monte', 'murder', 'rather', 'predictable.Despite', 'minor', 'pitfalls', ""'Mildred"", 'Pierce', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'part', 'noir', 'part', 'soap', 'opera', 'thrill', 'audiences', 'even', 'day']",N/A
144904,A2Q457CES5ZUZ,0792840054,William Hare,"[7, 8]","Joan Crawford had just left MGM for Warner Brothers and was determined to make a big hit for her new studio.  Michael Curtiz, who some three years earlier directed the studio's magnificent masterpiece, ""Casablanca"", was selected to join forces with the brunette star and the result was dynamite, as Crawford marched to a Best Actress Academy Award in ""Mildred Pierce.""The film was an adaptation by screenwriter Ronald McDougal of the James M. Cain novel, which marked one of three successive adaptive triumphs from one of his best sellers, glittering successes for three major female acting greats.  While ""Mildred Pierce"" was a soaring 1945 triumph for Crawford, Barbara Stanwyck had recently scaled the heights in ""Double Indemnity"" in 1944 and Lana Turner would receive her greatest plaudits for ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" in 1946.Crawford plays devoted mother Mildred Pierce, who is determined above all else to provide daughter Ann Blyth with all of the things she had been denied.  She begins by making pies for neighbors for extra money and struggles as a waitress in a busy downtown Los Angeles restaurant, but soon she scores a breakthrough and starts her own eaterie, which soon develops into a successful chain.The film begins with Crawford being interrogated after her disloyal husband, Zachary Scott, has been murdered at her beach house.  A flashback brings the story into the present, revealing the interesting array of characters who inhabit Mildred's life.  Bruce Bennett is sincere but luckless, having failed in the real estate business, after which the couple separates.  The daugher Bennett reveals as his favorite dies tragically of pneumonia, leaving only the spoiled Veda, played by Ann Blyth, concerning whom he warns Crawford, who fails to pay proper heed.  Crawford is forever and unsuccessfully pursued romantically by wise cracking and unethical Jack Carson, who makes a deal for her to obtain some property from Southern California socialite Zachary Scott on which she can start her first restaurant.  Eventually she will become romantically involved with Scott and ultimately marries him to satisfy Blyth, a social climber impressed with Scott's pedigree.Supplying wisecracking comments throughout is the inimitable Eve Arden, who serves as Crawford's Woman Friday in her restaurant operation.  It is Arden who delivers the brilliant script's premiere line when she tartly asserts, ""Veda (Blyth) is living proof that alligators have the right idea.  They eat their young.""Eventually the L.A. police solve the murder after many twists and turns of the complex series of relationships are exposed.  The film succeeds brilliantly into taking viewers inside the intricate world of a whole constellation of uniquely fascinating characters.  Audience members cannot help but feel that they know them much better than one could imagine over such a brief period of time, the result of strong plotting by Cain in his novel and excellent character revealing dialogue by McDougal.  The action moves throughout at a brisk pace, reflective of the brilliant Hungarian director Michael Curtiz.",5,Crawford Cops a Highly Deserved Oscar,1038614400,"11 30, 2002",2002,3115,"['Joan', 'Crawford', 'had', 'just', 'left', 'MGM', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'was', 'determined', 'make', 'big', 'hit', 'new', 'studio', 'Michael', 'Curtiz', 'who', 'three', 'years', 'earlier', 'directed', 'studio', 'magnificent', 'masterpiece', 'Casablanca', 'was', 'selected', 'join', 'forces', 'brunette', 'star', 'result', 'was', 'dynamite', 'Crawford', 'marched', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Mildred', 'Pierce', 'film', 'was', 'adaptation', 'screenwriter', 'Ronald', 'McDougal', 'James', 'M.', 'Cain', 'novel', 'marked', 'one', 'three', 'successive', 'adaptive', 'triumphs', 'one', 'best', 'sellers', 'glittering', 'successes', 'three', 'major', 'female', 'acting', 'greats', 'Mildred', 'Pierce', 'was', 'soaring', '1945', 'triumph', 'Crawford', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'had', 'recently', 'scaled', 'heights', 'Double', 'Indemnity', '1944', 'Lana', 'Turner', 'would', 'receive', 'greatest', 'plaudits', 'Postman', 'Always', 'Rings', 'Twice', '1946.Crawford', 'plays', 'devoted', 'mother', 'Mildred', 'Pierce', 'who', 'determined', 'else', 'provide', 'daughter', 'Ann', 'Blyth', 'things', 'had', 'been', 'denied', 'making', 'pies', 'neighbors', 'extra', 'money', 'waitress', 'busy', 'downtown', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'restaurant', 'soon', 'breakthrough', 'own', 'eaterie', 'soon', 'successful', 'chain.The', 'film', 'Crawford', 'being', 'interrogated', 'disloyal', 'husband', 'Zachary', 'Scott', 'been', 'murdered', 'beach', 'house', 'flashback', 'story', 'present', 'revealing', 'interesting', 'array', 'characters', 'who', 'inhabit', 'Mildred', 'life', 'Bruce', 'Bennett', 'sincere', 'luckless', 'having', 'failed', 'real', 'estate', 'business', 'couple', 'daugher', 'Bennett', 'favorite', 'dies', 'tragically', 'pneumonia', 'leaving', 'only', 'spoiled', 'Veda', 'played', 'Ann', 'Blyth', 'concerning', 'whom', 'Crawford', 'who', 'pay', 'proper', 'heed', 'Crawford', 'forever', 'unsuccessfully', 'pursued', 'romantically', 'wise', 'cracking', 'unethical', 'Jack', 'Carson', 'who', 'deal', 'obtain', 'property', 'Southern', 'California', 'socialite', 'Zachary', 'Scott', 'can', 'start', 'first', 'restaurant', 'Eventually', 'will', 'become', 'romantically', 'involved', 'Scott', 'ultimately', 'satisfy', 'Blyth', 'social', 'climber', 'impressed', 'Scott', 'pedigree.Supplying', 'wisecracking', 'comments', 'inimitable', 'Eve', 'Arden', 'who', 'Crawford', 'Woman', 'Friday', 'restaurant', 'operation', 'Arden', 'who', 'brilliant', 'script', 'premiere', 'line', 'when', 'tartly', 'Veda', 'Blyth', 'living', 'proof', 'alligators', 'have', 'right', 'idea', 'eat', 'young', 'Eventually', 'L.A.', 'police', 'solve', 'murder', 'many', 'twists', 'turns', 'complex', 'series', 'relationships', 'are', 'exposed', 'film', 'brilliantly', 'taking', 'viewers', 'intricate', 'world', 'whole', 'constellation', 'uniquely', 'fascinating', 'characters', 'members', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'feel', 'know', 'much', 'better', 'one', 'could', 'imagine', 'such', 'brief', 'period', 'time', 'result', 'strong', 'plotting', 'Cain', 'novel', 'excellent', 'character', 'revealing', 'dialogue', 'McDougal', 'action', 'brisk', 'pace', 'reflective', 'brilliant', 'Hungarian', 'director', 'Michael', 'Curtiz']",N/A

Any fan would agree that getting this movie alone is enough to race out and buy it.  Warner have gone the extra mile though and added a recent documentary on Crawford (and it's over an hour in length!), heaps of Crawford trailers for her other movies and also some snapshots of Awards she received for the film.  The film itself has been restored to pristine condition.  Still, there are some complaints  - when will Warner Bros move away from cardboard DVD cases? It is very annoying because these can get scratched! We want plastic cases, thanks.  The other complaint relates to the cover art.  Warner obviously didn't know their product because they have included a picture of Joan with a gun on the bottom of the cover with words referring that men wouldn't want to know her.  Wrong movie Warner!  I guess they'll fix it up, and for those who have this dud cover - well, it might be worth something in years to come because of this error!",5,Worth EVERY penny except for cardboard case,1046304000,"02 27, 2003",2003,1054,"['just', 'show', 'old', 'movie', 'can', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', 'lots', 'extra', 'features', 'take', 'note', 'Paramount', 'fan', 'would', 'agree', 'getting', 'movie', 'alone', 'enough', 'race', 'buy', 'Warner', 'have', 'gone', 'extra', 'mile', 'added', 'recent', 'documentary', 'Crawford', 'hour', 'length', 'heaps', 'Crawford', 'trailers', 'other', 'movies', 'also', 'snapshots', 'Awards', 'received', 'film', 'film', 'been', 'restored', 'pristine', 'condition', 'Still', 'are', 'complaints', 'when', 'will', 'Warner', 'Bros', 'move', 'away', 'cardboard', 'DVD', 'cases', 'very', 'annoying', 'can', 'get', 'scratched', 'want', 'plastic', 'cases', 'thanks', 'other', 'complaint', 'relates', 'cover', 'art', 'Warner', 'obviously', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'product', 'have', 'included', 'picture', 'Joan', 'gun', 'bottom', 'cover', 'words', 'referring', 'men', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'know', 'Wrong', 'movie', 'Warner', 'guess', ""'ll"", 'fix', 'up', 'who', 'have', 'dud', 'cover', 'well', 'might', 'be', 'worth', 'something', 'years', 'come', 'error']",N/A
