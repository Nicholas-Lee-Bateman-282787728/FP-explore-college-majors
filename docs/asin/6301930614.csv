He eventually is accounted as a suicide off a homebound train. In ""The Emperor's Club"" a teacher of long standing at a private school is passed over for a younger person to become the Dean. He resigns immediately but is compelled once again to return at the bequest of the younger Dean in pursuit of an alumni donation, where Mr. Hundert's services as a teacher are once again required.This is the same storyline but with a different approach. Our executive is Michael Caine and he, like Gart Williams is in the advertising business. In a great reverse effect, the main character becomes a murderer /hero as at first he executes an agressive and violence prone subway beggar by accident with a subtle push as a train just happens to come by.He leaves the subway like Paul Kersey in ""Death Wish"", climbing the stairwell amid the chaos as the Police run down the steps. This chance event now twists his mind and he begins to consider murder as a final solution with everyone in his way. Interesting and in some ways oddly funny, because you always know what is going through his mind at all times. The theme negates the term ""You can't always get what you want"" and it is somewhat of a fantasy of course. If there is anything negative to say  perhaps it  is that Caine seems very out of place using foul language here and there in the film.

Caine's wife, also well played by Swoosie Kurtz, one of the great unknown American stage and film actresses, is a serious [problem] to him. So he has two people in his life who are supremely annoying.What does he do? Well, let's just say that his solution to these two problems ends in the population of the world changing, shall we?The dialogue in this very smart blackly comic thriller is sharp as a razor; it's a lot of fun to watch Mr. Caine give us his best as a put upon exec who's more than capable of flying into a rage at the drop of a hat and of executing his very sneaky and well thought out plans for revenge. Also on hand is Elizabeth Perkins, an equally intelligent office colleague who attracts Caine in more ways than one, but does not suspect him of any wrongdoing at all. That is, until...One of the best office comedies around, A Shock to the System is a stinging portrait of greed and selfishness in America--for my money, far better than the somewhat overblown Wall Street.

Wishes that they could never in their right minds fulfill. A middle aged man has given his life to his job, to his marriage and, he finds himself in a messy mess. His reward for all this work is to find himself looked over in a promotion, and a wife who won't forgive him for not receiving that promotion.Michael Caine plays Graham Marshall , the man awaiting that promotion. His wife, played by Swoozie Kurts celebrates his anxiously awaited promotion. Frustrated that his hated life will never change, he devises a plan to take revenge on everyone who humiliated him, and he starts with his wife.  The film has several actors who will surprise you because they are so young!Michael Caine is a genius in this type of film. It is not a nice film, per se. Elizabeth McGovern plays a colleague, young, lithe and adoring. It takes awhile for her to realize what a new life with Graham would be all about. This is a film that keeps you off balance, I was never sure which way the wind would blow, so to speak. Will Patton, ( you will recognize him, right away), plays a Connecticut State Policemen.

He was impossibly beautiful as a young man, but middle aged Michael with serious bags under his eyes and a slight weight problem has an air of wounded vanity, as if he can't quite understand how things went wrong.Caine, as Graham Marshall, is a fairly successful marketing director with an expensive home, an expensive and slightly boring wife, and is desperately anticipating a promotion for his many years of diligence.  He is stunned when he is passed over for a young, brash associate.  Graham has an epiphany when a particularly smarmy panhandler enrages him, and Graham impulsively shoves him off the subway platform in the path of an oncoming train.  No one has seen him and Graham muses on his ""magical"" powers.  He quickly and cleverly dispatches the wife and the business rival, gets rid of his white elephant of a house in the suburbs, boards the pets and gets a tasteful apartment in Manhattan.  Though homicide Lt. Laker (Will Patton with a splendid Long Island accent) is suspicious, nothing can be proved.  Graham not only gets the promotion, he has his eye on taking over the company, dispatching his rivals on his upward climb.What keeps the tension intact is the victims are not cartoon-like villains.  The wife is irritating, but not evil.  The youngster who beat him out for the promotion is vulgar, but it is clear he is clever and competent.  We just cannot help but cheer Graham on his nefarious way.  Michael Caine's glee and satisfaction are catching.There is more than a whiff of Alec Guinness's ""Kind Hearts and Coronets"" in Caine's performance, but Michael Caine has a knack for villainy all his own. ""Shock to the System"" may be a trifle of a movie, but it is a highly enjoyable trifle. ....",4,Play Naughty; Win Big,1055721600,"06 16, 2003",2003,1778,"['Michael', 'Caine', 'marvelous', 'when', 'playing', 'happy', 'villain', 'was', 'impossibly', 'beautiful', 'young', 'man', 'middle', 'aged', 'Michael', 'serious', 'bags', 'eyes', 'slight', 'weight', 'problem', 'air', 'wounded', 'vanity', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'understand', 'how', 'things', 'went', 'wrong.Caine', 'Graham', 'Marshall', 'fairly', 'successful', 'marketing', 'director', 'expensive', 'home', 'expensive', 'slightly', 'boring', 'wife', 'desperately', 'anticipating', 'promotion', 'many', 'years', 'diligence', 'stunned', 'when', 'passed', 'young', 'brash', 'associate', 'Graham', 'epiphany', 'when', 'particularly', 'smarmy', 'panhandler', 'Graham', 'impulsively', 'off', 'subway', 'platform', 'path', 'oncoming', 'train', 'one', 'seen', 'Graham', 'muses', 'magical', 'powers', 'quickly', 'cleverly', 'wife', 'business', 'rival', 'rid', 'white', 'elephant', 'house', 'suburbs', 'pets', 'tasteful', 'apartment', 'Manhattan', 'Though', 'homicide', 'Lt.', 'Laker', 'Will', 'Patton', 'splendid', 'Long', 'Island', 'accent', 'suspicious', 'nothing', 'can', 'be', 'proved', 'Graham', 'not', 'only', 'promotion', 'eye', 'taking', 'over', 'company', 'dispatching', 'rivals', 'upward', 'climb.What', 'tension', 'intact', 'victims', 'are', 'not', 'cartoon-like', 'villains', 'wife', 'irritating', 'not', 'evil', 'youngster', 'who', 'beat', 'out', 'promotion', 'vulgar', 'clear', 'clever', 'competent', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'cheer', 'Graham', 'nefarious', 'way', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'glee', 'satisfaction', 'are', 'catching.There', 'more', 'whiff', 'Alec', 'Guinness', 'Kind', 'Hearts', 'Coronets', 'Caine', 'performance', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'knack', 'villainy', 'own', 'Shock', 'System', 'may', 'be', 'trifle', 'movie', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'trifle']",A Shock to the System VHS

It glorifies, yet vilifies, the face of corporate mobility, the infighting, the shifting loyalties, the costs and what it really takes to make it to the top.There are undeniable elements of dark humor in this movie. The other reviews are testament to this part of the movie. There is however more social commentary present. Corporate attitude and disparity in the social classes are plainly set out and exhibited. This can be seen in the many portions of the movie where Caine the corporate warrior walks past homeless people camped in the streets of New York. The superficial camaraderie and brutal, smiling infighting of corporate life has rarely been better captured on film.The movie features the music of Gary Chang played by the Turtle Island Quartet, which adds to the bittersweet atmosphere of this film.The topping of this movie is the acting of Michael Caine. Caine brilliantly portrays a corporate officer who has been turned down to a promotion. Through machinations and scheming, he covets the higher position and eliminates everyone in his way. His acting in this movie is a gem in a long and stellar career.",5,Another Michael Caine Triumph,1351814400,"11 2, 2012",2012,1234,"['movie', 'pitfalls', 'upwardly', 'mobile', '1990', 'movie', 'here', 'A', 'Shock', 'System', 'yet', 'vilifies', 'face', 'corporate', 'mobility', 'infighting', 'shifting', 'loyalties', 'costs', 'what', 'really', 'make', 'are', 'undeniable', 'elements', 'dark', 'humor', 'movie', 'other', 'reviews', 'are', 'testament', 'part', 'movie', 'however', 'more', 'social', 'commentary', 'present', 'Corporate', 'attitude', 'disparity', 'social', 'classes', 'are', 'plainly', 'set', 'out', 'exhibited', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'many', 'portions', 'movie', 'where', 'Caine', 'corporate', 'warrior', 'walks', 'past', 'homeless', 'people', 'camped', 'streets', 'New', 'York', 'superficial', 'camaraderie', 'brutal', 'smiling', 'infighting', 'corporate', 'life', 'rarely', 'been', 'better', 'captured', 'film.The', 'movie', 'music', 'Gary', 'Chang', 'played', 'Turtle', 'Island', 'Quartet', 'bittersweet', 'atmosphere', 'film.The', 'topping', 'movie', 'acting', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Caine', 'brilliantly', 'corporate', 'officer', 'who', 'been', 'turned', 'down', 'promotion', 'machinations', 'scheming', 'higher', 'position', 'everyone', 'way', 'acting', 'movie', 'gem', 'long', 'stellar', 'career']",A Shock to the System VHS
