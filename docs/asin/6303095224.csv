355907,A1X44LCV427TRE,6303095224,Elaine J. Campbell,"[17, 17]","Shirley Temple, whose career as a child star was over by the age of 10 (and who, according to her very good autobiography, reaped a mere $18.00 from it when she asked her father for her reapings upon her second marriage), shines and super-shines in this adorable and heart-rending film.She and her sister are orphans.  A mysterious benefactor adopts them and they enter a life of luxury, but also a life of love.  Rochelle Hudson is delicately beautiful as the sister, and John Boles is excellent and exceedingly handsome.  I wonder what happened to them both?&quot;Animal Crackers&quot; and &quot;When I Grow Up&quot; are the top numbers, as well as several sung by Boles and Hudson.  All works out as it should be.There's just something very moving about this movie.  It's a genuine heart-tugger.And Shirley is simply a delight!  So glad the camera caught this amazing little girl with such a natural talent shining through her girlhood.",5,GOTTA BE ONE OF SHIRLEY'S BEST.,1006646400,"11 25, 2001",2001,939,"['Shirley', 'Temple', 'career', 'child', 'star', 'was', 'age', '10', 'who', 'according', 'very', 'good', 'autobiography', 'reaped', 'mere', '18.00', 'when', 'asked', 'father', 'reapings', 'second', 'marriage', 'shines', 'super-shines', 'adorable', 'heart-rending', 'film.She', 'sister', 'are', 'orphans', 'mysterious', 'benefactor', 'enter', 'life', 'luxury', 'also', 'life', 'love', 'Rochelle', 'Hudson', 'delicately', 'beautiful', 'sister', 'John', 'Boles', 'excellent', 'exceedingly', 'handsome', 'wonder', 'what', 'happened', 'quot', 'Animal', 'Crackers', 'quot', 'quot', 'When', 'Grow', 'Up', 'quot', 'are', 'top', 'numbers', 'as', 'well', 'several', 'sung', 'Boles', 'Hudson', 'out', 'should', 'be.There', 'just', 'something', 'very', 'moving', 'movie', 'genuine', 'heart-tugger.And', 'Shirley', 'simply', 'delight', 'So', 'glad', 'camera', 'caught', 'amazing', 'little', 'girl', 'natural', 'talent', 'shining', 'girlhood']",Curly Top VHS
355908,A3AP6H48QHX8BR,6303095224,"Kimberly M. ""Kimberly""","[2, 2]","One of Shirley's earlier films it's also one of her best-- Shirley's curly hair isn't the only thing that is showcased in this film-- this one features more of her favorite songs including that famous""Animal Crackers In My Soup.""In this Shirley plays an orphan who is the troublemaker and joker of the orphanage. When Bole(""Littlest Rebel"") comes to visit the orphanage as one of the benifactors of the orphanage-- he becomes entranced by ""Curly Top"" who decides to adopt-- he learns that Shirley has an older sister as well so he decides to adopt both of them-- but, under the condition they never know who the rich benefactor is who adopted them making up ""Hireman Jones."" Well, the family slows blends together... Bole and Elizabeth's sister begin to fall in love-- when Elizabeth's sis becomes engaged to someone else it looks like the family will soon be split until a sudden moment of revalation.Bole does a wonderful job in this Shirley film and you see all that charisma by Bole and Shirley again.  There is not a ton of singing done by Shirley in this flick mainly by her on-screen sister and Bole but, it is still a good movie and features the famous ""Animal Crackers in my Soup.""

Soon enough she is adopted my mr.rich and she is living it large. it's like one of her normal orphan flicks with those cute dimples,smile,singing,and dancing. it's fun to watch her adjust to the new lifestyle complete with all her little toys,bed,and watching her at the beach.She also does a cute little song with a jump rope saying when she grows up .......  i say she should never have grown up...oh well",4,Shirley Curly,992995200,"06 20, 2001",2001,674,"['movie', ""n't"", 'greatest', 'have', 'very', 'cute', 'storyline', 'Elizabeth', 'orphan', 'sister', 'Mary', 'who', 'performer', 'parents', 'who', 'have', 'died', '.she', 'sings', 'way', 'trouble', 'well', 'good', 'life', 'actually', 'when', 'animal', 'crackers', 'soup', 'enough', 'adopted', 'mr.rich', 'living', 'large', 'one', 'normal', 'orphan', 'flicks', 'cute', 'dimples', 'smile', 'singing', 'dancing', 'fun', 'watch', 'adjust', 'new', 'lifestyle', 'complete', 'little', 'toys', 'bed', 'watching', 'beach.She', 'also', 'cute', 'little', 'song', 'jump', 'rope', 'saying', 'when', 'up', 'i', 'say', 'should', 'never', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'oh', 'well']",Curly Top VHS

Tagliaferro,"[13, 14]","Shirley Temple is pint-sized in this film and is fun to watch as she sings some of her number one theme songs &quot;Animal Crakers in my Soup&quot; and &quot;When I Grow Up.&quot;  Shirley plays Elizabeth, an orphan living at an orphange that her sister Mary works at.  Shirley charms one of the trustees and he imediately falls in love with her spunk.  The movie has some entertaining moments that strike us all.  I always laugh when Elizabeth is trying to adjust to her new rich and spoiled life.  All though Shirley seems to be sweet and innocent through the whole movie, she has a selfish point where she says she rather have a pair of roller skates when her gaurdian gives her a pearl necklace.  She saves that little rude comment by putting on a benefit for her orphan friends.  The story line at times is hard to follow, but as always ends happily.  Curly Top is a wonderful movie for young children, but doesn't have a moral or a point.  Shirley of course will dazzle you!",4,A delightful Shirley Temple Film!,979257600,"01 12, 2001",2001,980,"['Shirley', 'Temple', 'pint-sized', 'film', 'fun', 'watch', 'number', 'one', 'theme', 'songs', 'quot', 'Animal', 'Crakers', 'Soup', 'quot', 'quot', 'When', 'Grow', 'Up.', 'quot', 'Shirley', 'Elizabeth', 'orphan', 'living', 'orphange', 'sister', 'Mary', 'Shirley', 'one', 'trustees', 'imediately', 'love', 'spunk', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'moments', 'strike', 'always', 'when', 'Elizabeth', 'trying', 'adjust', 'new', 'rich', 'spoiled', 'life', 'Shirley', 'be', 'sweet', 'innocent', 'whole', 'movie', 'selfish', 'point', 'where', 'rather', 'have', 'pair', 'roller', 'skates', 'when', 'gaurdian', 'pearl', 'necklace', 'little', 'rude', 'comment', 'putting', 'benefit', 'orphan', 'friends', 'story', 'line', 'times', 'hard', 'follow', 'always', 'happily', 'Curly', 'Top', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'young', 'children', ""n't"", 'have', 'moral', 'point', 'Shirley', 'course', 'will', 'dazzle']",Curly Top VHS
