1251398,A2Z7UOGHVYUKBZ,B0026BTRUK,I Teach Typing,"[0, 0]","This video is a uniquely excellent study of art.  The quality of the video is good and the narration is perfect.  The historians who talk about the pictures do a brilliant job describing the construction of the images and these discussions are supplemented by superb animations that show the construction of perspective, color and shadows.However, there are two weaknesses here.  First the minor gripe, the historians clearly love Vermeer and when they are not talking about the technical aspects of his painting they do gush a bit.  A more serious weakness is the amount of material covered and the length of the video.  The video only shows about a dozen of his paintings and more than 10 percent of the video is environment/nature shots and credits. So, what is covered is as good at it gets but I feel a bit shortchanged....",4,Brilliantly done,1401235200,"05 28, 2014",2014,828,"['video', 'uniquely', 'excellent', 'study', 'art', 'quality', 'video', 'good', 'narration', 'perfect', 'historians', 'who', 'talk', 'pictures', 'do', 'brilliant', 'job', 'describing', 'construction', 'images', 'discussions', 'are', 'supplemented', 'superb', 'animations', 'show', 'construction', 'perspective', 'color', 'shadows.However', 'are', 'two', 'weaknesses', 'here', 'First', 'minor', 'gripe', 'historians', 'clearly', 'love', 'Vermeer', 'when', 'are', 'not', 'talking', 'technical', 'aspects', 'painting', 'do', 'gush', 'bit', 'more', 'serious', 'weakness', 'amount', 'material', 'covered', 'length', 'video', 'video', 'only', 'dozen', 'paintings', 'more', '10', 'percent', 'video', 'environment/nature', 'shots', 'credits', 'So', 'what', 'covered', 'as', 'good', 'feel', 'bit', 'shortchanged']",Vermeer: Master of Light

It was so very interesting to me to view this excellent video on the detailed engineering used by the masters of figurative painting to make sure every  placement of design and color were ""engineered"" to reflect the absolute to the human eye.

1251401,AK2FSJJ7GAN8B,B0026BTRUK,"Nancy C. De Young ""darthmader""","[6, 6]","I happen to love Vermeer's work...contrasts of light and everyday subjects. To get a flavor of life in his timethe movie Girl with a Pearl Earring is wonderful...done in the same tones as his work. This DVD narrated by MerylStreep is a great study of his works and she is joined by Art Historians who use modern techniques to explainhow he painted and how precise Vermeer was in color, composition, and most importantly, his use of LIGHT.Little is actually known of Vermeer..he left no letters etc,,,just his magnificent works of art, numbering 35 in all.There is so much mystery about his life, in fact, much is surmised from Dutch history and the culture of thetime, but nothing directly of his thoughts, feelings, motivations. What is known and accepted in the art world is thathe was a great Master artist and his use of light consistent and unique. I so liked the explanations of how scientific he wasin focus and use of color. His subjects were household members mostly, and are a visual comment of the times, mores,dress, and attitudes of the Dutch in the 1600's . He died at 43, was beholden to benefactors, and had many children.It seemed he was at home where he worked most of the time. Interesting so little is known of him.I would love to see more of these sorts of documentaries done by art experts about the Impressionists as well andgreat Masters..art history classes on dvd would be wonderful. I am lucky to live near the Smithsonian, one of America'streasures, as well as the Corcoran Gallery of  Art. If you find Vermeer's work interesting you will want to own this DVDand learn how incredibly talented he really was.
