1554371,A2582KMXLK2P06,B008J691HU,B. E Jackson,"[1, 3]","I went in expecting People Like Us to at least be a *little* better than this.  The description seemed so full of potential.  After a man loses his father, he discovers he has a sister (played by Elizabeth Banks) that he never knew about.  Well, what happens then isn't what I consider a coherent plot.  More like a bunch of disjointed awkwardly written segments that are neither captivating or movie-quality storytelling by any means.  It's confusing too, trying to keep yourself focused on the characters, their interactions and their intentions only to end up disappointed when the quality doesn't ever improve, so you end up not really caring what happens to anyone.  It's bad writing.I *think* the movie writers are trying to implement comedy involving the character of Chris Pine (the main character).  I almost thought he was Michael Weatherly from NCIS- the two men resemble each other quite a bit, and Chris portrays the same smarmy arrogant character as Michael in NCIS as well.  An unmistakable similarity.  A google search reveals several other people agree with me.The writing is just awful all around.  Chris and Elizabeth apparently fall in love which of course, is wrong on many levels.  So basically the first half is all about Chris arrogantly finding his way to a funeral and meeting up with his sister in the most uninteresting way imaginable, the middle part of the movie is about slow-moving, barely adequate romance between Chris and his sister (ugh, so terrible- WAY overlong too) and the third half?  Well by then it's obvious the movie is a complete failure.  The mother has health issues that are finally addressed, Elizabeth Bank's son expresses a violent outburst, Chris gets slapped around due to not revealing the ""really big secret"" earlier, MORE romance, MORE slow-moving drivel... ugh.  Enough is enough.Oh and, about the son- the only worthwhile segments are when Elizabeth's son causes trouble and has to see a shrink to help sort out his anger issues which eventually spills into a violent outburst later on, and this is supposed to be a small, insignificant subplot to the main story.  You know a movie isn't any good when *this* is the aspect that draws you in.  Of course the soundtrack is awesome since the music focuses on the 60's and 70's.  This means plenty of Clash, Bob Dylan, King Crimson, Television- all the artists people believe are the more legendary ones.  You hear this music mainly because the father (the dead guy Chris' character is supposed to care about) was a record producer, and so Chris Pine now has complete access to his fathers record collection.  Of course, I have a suspicion that this great music is *only* included as a way to cover up a weak storyline.  Nice try.  Even then, it completely goes away in the second half.Overall, highly recommend you skip this.  It says drama but it's actually romantic boredom with a feel good quality that's too tackily implemented to seem believable or have any meaning.  I'd feel really awful if I actually cried during the end of this one.  It'd mean a terrible movie actually had an impact on me.  Ha!",2,"ugh, awful writing",1371254400,"06 15, 2013",2013,3111,"['went', 'expecting', 'People', 'Us', 'least', 'be', '*little*', 'better', 'description', 'seemed', 'so', 'full', 'potential', 'man', 'father', 'sister', 'played', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'never', 'knew', 'Well', 'what', 'then', ""n't"", 'what', 'consider', 'coherent', 'plot', 'More', 'bunch', 'disjointed', 'awkwardly', 'written', 'segments', 'are', 'captivating', 'movie-quality', 'storytelling', 'means', 'confusing', 'too', 'trying', 'keep', 'focused', 'characters', 'interactions', 'intentions', 'only', 'end', 'up', 'disappointed', 'when', 'quality', ""n't"", 'ever', 'improve', 'end', 'up', 'not', 'really', 'caring', 'what', 'anyone', 'bad', 'writing.I', '*think*', 'movie', 'writers', 'are', 'trying', 'implement', 'comedy', 'involving', 'character', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'main', 'character', 'almost', 'thought', 'was', 'Michael', 'Weatherly', 'NCIS-', 'two', 'men', 'resemble', 'other', 'quite', 'bit', 'Chris', 'same', 'smarmy', 'arrogant', 'character', 'Michael', 'NCIS', 'as', 'well', 'unmistakable', 'similarity', 'google', 'search', 'reveals', 'several', 'other', 'people', 'agree', 'me.The', 'writing', 'just', 'awful', 'around', 'Chris', 'Elizabeth', 'apparently', 'fall', 'love', 'course', 'wrong', 'many', 'levels', 'So', 'basically', 'first', 'half', 'Chris', 'arrogantly', 'finding', 'way', 'funeral', 'meeting', 'up', 'sister', 'most', 'uninteresting', 'way', 'imaginable', 'middle', 'part', 'movie', 'slow-moving', 'barely', 'adequate', 'romance', 'Chris', 'sister', 'ugh', 'so', 'terrible-', 'WAY', 'too', 'third', 'half', 'Well', 'then', 'obvious', 'movie', 'complete', 'failure', 'mother', 'health', 'issues', 'are', 'finally', 'addressed', 'Elizabeth', 'Bank', 'son', 'violent', 'outburst', 'Chris', 'slapped', 'due', 'not', 'revealing', 'really', 'big', 'secret', 'earlier', 'MORE', 'romance', 'MORE', 'slow-moving', 'drivel', 'ugh', 'Enough', 'enough.Oh', 'son-', 'only', 'worthwhile', 'segments', 'are', 'when', 'Elizabeth', 'son', 'trouble', 'see', 'shrink', 'help', 'sort', 'out', 'anger', 'issues', 'eventually', 'violent', 'outburst', 'later', 'supposed', 'be', 'small', 'insignificant', 'subplot', 'main', 'story', 'know', 'movie', ""n't"", 'good', 'when', '*this*', 'aspect', 'course', 'soundtrack', 'awesome', 'music', '60', '70', 'plenty', 'Clash', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'King', 'Crimson', 'Television-', 'artists', 'people', 'believe', 'are', 'more', 'legendary', 'ones', 'hear', 'music', 'mainly', 'father', 'dead', 'guy', 'Chris', 'character', 'supposed', 'care', 'was', 'record', 'producer', 'so', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'now', 'complete', 'access', 'fathers', 'record', 'collection', 'course', 'have', 'suspicion', 'great', 'music', '*only*', 'included', 'way', 'cover', 'up', 'weak', 'storyline', 'Nice', 'try', 'Even', 'then', 'completely', 'away', 'second', 'half.Overall', 'highly', 'recommend', 'skip', 'drama', 'actually', 'romantic', 'boredom', 'feel', 'good', 'quality', 'too', 'tackily', 'implemented', 'seem', 'believable', 'have', 'meaning', ""'d"", 'feel', 'really', 'awful', 'actually', 'cried', 'end', 'one', ""'d"", 'mean', 'terrible', 'movie', 'actually', 'had', 'impact', 'Ha']",N/A

But in 2012, Kurtzman made his directorial debut with ""People Like Us"", which he co-wrote with Robert Orci (""Star Trek"", ""The Legend of Zorro"", ""Transformers"", ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"") and actor Jody Lambert.The film would star Chris Pine (""Star Trek"", ""This Means War"", ""Unstoppable""), Elizabeth Banks (""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"", ""The Hunger Games"", ""The 40-Year-Old-Virgin""), Michelle Pfeiffer (""Scarface"", ""Batman Returns"", ""What Lies Beneath""), Olivia Wilde (""TRON: Legacy"", ""In Time"", ""House M.D."") and Jon Favreau (portrayed by ""Iron Man"", ""Iron Man 2&#8243;, ""Swingers"").VIDEO:""People Like Us"" is presented at 1080p High Definition (2:35:1 aspect ratio).  I like the fact that Kurtzman wanted to show a different side of Los Angeles and not utilize the banal stock footage scenes to show the glitzier side of the city.  With plenty of outdoor scenes, the picture quality of this film is vibrant, really good detail when it comes to the closeups. Skin tones are natural, black levels are nice and deep and I didn't see any problems during my viewing of this film.  No artifacts or excessive DNR, picture quality for ""People Like Us"" on Blu-ray was great!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""People Like Us"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and 2.0 Dolby Digital, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital Language.  While the film is primarily a dialogue-driven film, there are scenes that do utilize the surround channels such as an explosion in the pool, speeding through traffic or crowd ambiance.  But ""People Like Us"" is primarily a front and center-channel driven film.Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES""People Like Us"" comes with the following special features:Number One with a Bullet: The Story Behind ""People Like Us"" - (14:28) Inspired by true events, filmmakers Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci talk about working on big budget films and going back to their roots to create a small film.Audio Commentary 1 - Audio Commentary with Writer/Director Alex Kurtzman and Actors Chris Pine and Elizabeth BanksAudio Commentary 2 - Audio Commentary with Writer/Director Alex Kurtzman and Writers Roberto Orci and Jody LambertSelected Scene Audio Commentary - Audio Commentary with Writer/Director Alex Kurtzman and Actress Michelle Pfeiffer for eight selected scenes.Taco Talk - (4:51) Improv takes featuring Chris Pine and Elizabeth Banks and Pine talking about filming at his favorite local taco stand, Henry's Tacos.Deleted Scenes/Extended Scenes - (18:25) Featuring introductions by Alex Kurtzman for each of the five deleted scenes.Bloopers - (3:24) Outtakes from ""People Like Us"".EXTRAS:""People Like Us"" comes with a DVD version of the film presented in 2:35:1 aspect ratio - enhanced for 169 televisions, English, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital, English DVS 2.0 Dolby Digital and Subtitles in English SDH, French and Spanish.JUDGMENT CALL:How far would you go in order to get to know more about a sibling that you never knew existed?  ""People Like Us"" a film inspired by real-life events of writer/director Alex Kurtzman discovering at the age of 30, that he had two half-siblings.A personal film for Kurtzman, but also for he and writer/partner Bob Orci, it was a way to step back and return to their roots of film writing and taking that experience to create their own film and for Alex, directing it.Taking eight years for Kurtzman to write, in many interviews, Kurtzman has said that this film was something he and Bob Orci wanted to create for themselves and allowing part of their lives to be incorporated into this story.  But most importantly, to create an independent film, which would eventually become a studio movie.  While a third writer and good friend of Kurtzman, Jody Lamber was brought into bring a voice outside of the ideas that he and Orci brought to the table.""People Like Us"" is a touching film with a pretty solid cast with Chris Pine, Elizabeth Banks, Olivia Wilde and Michelle Pfeiffer.  Amazing to have this cast, considering the film was shot with a low-budget in Los Angeles.But with family dramas such as ""People Like Us"" not really being made anymore for today's cinema, ""People Like Us"" is an interesting film about two broken individuals who happen to have a connection thanks to their father.  While Chris Pine held his own with wonderful performances by Michelle Pfeiffer, Elizabeth Banks and Olivia Wilde, part of the enjoyment of this film relies on the concept of relationships.Aside from the character of Sam trying to get to know his sister Frankie, by not telling her who he really is, there are other relationships that come to play in this film.  Sam and his girlfriend Hannah, Sam and his mother Lillian and Frankie and her son Josh.  Each of these relationships are troubled at one point, but somehow and someway they try to find a resolve to the pain that is affecting their relationship.While the relationship angle worked very well for the film, the whole story of Sam in trouble with the FTC felt unnecessary.  As the film tries to paint him as a man who would do anything for money, the whole trouble of him being in legal trouble felt unnecessary when the film's primary focus was on relationships and it became more of a distraction.And one scene that revolves around Frankie trying to threaten the Los Angeles school principal of a lawsuit for her son causing damage to the school pool, for anyone who attends school in Los Angeles know already that causing major damage by explosion at a LAUSD school will automatically lead to expulsion and other problems.  So, I found it a bit interesting for her son to even get a second chance.  And I felt that perhaps there could have been another way of showing that her son is troubled.But aside from these minor quips, I enjoyed the film and as for the Blu-ray release, how awesome to have three audio commentary tracks included plus other bonus featurettes.  Also, with the film being shot in Los Angeles, many scenes shot outdoors, picture quality looked great.  Colors were vibrant, skin tones were natural and I saw no problems with overall picture quality.  Of course, the film is primarily dialogue-driven but there are some scenes with crowds and the character of Sam in traffic that is carried over into the surround sounds via ambiance.  And last, the Blu-ray release also comes with a DVD version of the film.Overall, ""People Like Us"" is a touching and entertaining film with a wonderful cast.  While not too deep or emotional, I found Kurtzman and Orci's writing to be much better than a few of their big budget films.  And this return for them to get back to their roots worked to the film's efficacy and the fact they were able to get this cast with the budget they were given is amazing.  And I hope that both Kurtzman and Orci continue in doing more of these type of films or even indie films outside of the big budget sci-fi films which they have done many times throughout their writing oeuvre.Recommended!",4,"Touching and entertaining, ""People Like Us"" features the directorial debut of writer Alex Kurtzman",1354320000,"12 1, 2012",2012,7396,"['Alex', 'Kurtzman', 'best', 'known',

Zalewski ""Get it, try it, write about it.""","[45, 51]","When you grow up in a family that society doesn't consider to be ""normal"" you may wonder if there is anyone else like you. It often comes as a surprise that there are indeed People Like Us.Initially I looked forward to seeing Chris Pine (he's a cutie and I liked him in Star Trek) and Elizabeth Banks (she's pretty and funny in Zack and Miri and a few other comedy roles) but didn't expect such phenomenal acting. I figured it'd be ""okay"" but not moving. I was pleasantly surprised!At the start of the film, we meet Sam (Pine) who's a young hot shot driven by money but kind of a jerk. He gets into a jam when a business deal goes wrong (and violates a few laws) and is in desperate need of money to make things right. As he struggles to save his job, he finds out his father has died. His girlfriend expects him to be upset and fly across the country to be with his mother for the funeral.However, Sam doesn't think much of his father. When they arrive, the tension between him and his mother paints a broader picture. Sam hasn't been home in years. Then a bombshell is dropped on him... His dad wants him to deliver a large sum of cash to a half-sister he never knew existed.I expected Sam to take the money and run even though I knew there wouldn't be much of a movie of that happened!As he gets to know his sister and her son, Sam grows into a more mature man and eventually realizes his father wasn't the man he thought he was. As for his sister Frankie (Banks), it was amazing to watch how she tried her hardest as a working single mother despite all the crap life dealt her.My favorite scene is how she deals with the principal after Josh blew up the school's swimming pool...I really related to this movie. My own family is a bit different and there have been times I disliked family members and there's been drama. Over the years things have changed - we've all changed - and most barriers are overcome. The end scene with Sam and Frankie (I won't give it away!) brought tears to my eyes...tears of happiness and hope. It was such a touching moment and gave them (and me) a new perspective on their father.Most importantly, it reinforced the importance I have for my family. I won't call this a ""feel good"" movie exactly, but it shows a real, plausible, modern family situation.  It gives hope that people can make the best of their situation and choose to embrace it rather than fight it.  I wish I could better describe why I love this movie so much, but it's really hard for me to put into words. It's a movie that made me feel something in my heart.*This review originally appeared on my blog darcyandbrian.com after screening it on a media trip",5,Heartwarming - There ARE People Like Us,1348272000,"09 22, 2012",2012,2658,"['When', 'grow', 'up', 'family', 'society', ""n't"", 'consider', 'be', 'normal', 'may', 'wonder', 'anyone', 'else', 'often', 'surprise', 'are', 'indeed', 'People', 'Us.Initially', 'looked', 'forward', 'seeing', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'cutie', 'liked', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'pretty', 'funny', 'Zack', 'Miri', 'few', 'other', 'comedy', 'roles', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'such', 'phenomenal', 'acting', 'figured', ""'d"", 'be', 'okay', 'not', 'moving', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'start', 'film', 'meet', 'Sam', 'Pine', 'who', 'young', 'hot', 'shot', 'driven', 'money', 'kind', 'jerk', 'jam', 'when', 'business', 'deal', 'wrong', 'few', 'laws', 'desperate', 'need', 'money', 'make', 'things', 'right', 'save', 'job', 'out', 'father', 'died', 'girlfriend', 'be', 'upset', 'fly', 'country', 'be', 'mother', 'funeral.However', 'Sam', ""n't"", 'think', 'much', 'father', 'When', 'arrive', 'tension', 'mother', 'broader', 'picture', 'Sam', ""n't"", 'been', 'home', 'years', 'Then', 'bombshell', 'dropped', 'dad', 'deliver', 'large', 'sum', 'cash', 'half-sister', 'never', 'knew', 'existed.I', 'expected', 'Sam', 'take', 'money', 'run', 'even', 'knew', 'there', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'much', 'movie', 'happened', 'know', 'sister', 'son', 'Sam', 'more', 'mature', 'man', 'eventually', 'realizes', 'father', 'was', ""n't"", 'man', 'thought', 'was', 'sister', 'Frankie', 'Banks', 'was', 'amazing', 'watch', 'how', 'tried', 'hardest', 'working', 'single', 'mother', 'crap', 'life', 'dealt', 'her.My', 'favorite', 'scene', 'how', 'principal', 'Josh', 'blew', 'up', 'school', 'swimming', 'pool', 'really', 'related', 'movie', 'own', 'family', 'bit', 'different', 'have', 'been', 'times', 'disliked', 'family', 'members', 'been', 'drama', 'years', 'things', 'have', 'changed', ""'ve"", 'changed', 'most', 'barriers', 'are', 'overcome', 'end', 'scene', 'Sam', 'Frankie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'brought', 'tears', 'eyes', 'tears', 'happiness', 'hope', 'was', 'such', 'touching', 'moment', 'gave', 'new', 'perspective', 'father.Most', 'importantly', 'reinforced', 'importance', 'have', 'family', 'wo', ""n't"", 'call', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'exactly', 'real', 'plausible', 'modern', 'family', 'situation', 'hope', 'people', 'can', 'make', 'best', 'situation', 'choose', 'embrace', 'rather', 'fight', 'wish', 'could', 'better', 'describe', 'why', 'love', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'really', 'hard', 'put', 'words', 'movie', 'made', 'feel', 'something', 'heart', 'review', 'originally', 'appeared', 'blog', 'darcyandbrian.com', 'screening', 'media', 'trip']",N/A

People like Us had a great plot without quite perfect execution. The script tends to be a bit disjointed, though there are some really great scenes regardless.The acting is really superb all around given the limited material the actors had to work with. I was particularly impressed with Olivia Wilde, who is in only in a handful of scenes as Sam(Chris Pine)'s girlfriend, but is incredibly believable and develops a rather full caricature in a short amount of time. She really is one of the best actresses on screen today. Michael Hall D'Addario (Josh), as Frankie (Elizabeth Bank)'s son is remarkable. He is so much fun to watch. Chris Pine, Elizabeth Banks, and Michelle Pfeiffer bring to the screen all that you would expect of actors of their caliber. Although, if I'm perfectly honest, I would watch Chris Pine in just about anything. So maybe I'm a bit biased.As another review has noted, the scene with Sam giving Josh his 6 rules on life he got from his dad is fantastic. That alone makes it worth seeing the movie out.

1554395,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B008J691HU,Ed Uyeshima,"[0, 0]","A studio picture with a premise this contrived shouldn't work, but this 2012 family drama works in ways that are quite unexpected and emotionally resonant because a palpable level of truthfulness emerges with the characters even as the plot teeters precariously on credibility issues. First-time filmmaker Alex Kurtzman, a go-to screenwriter of uber-action fare likeStar TrekandMission: Impossible III, based his personal movie on events in his own life when he met his own half-sister for the first time as he turned thirty. The plot focuses on Sam, a slick, 31-year-old huckster of a salesman in the bartering business. Just as he gets snagged by a bad deal that costs him the huge bonus he just secured to pay off long-standing debts, Sam finds out his father, Jerry Harper, a legendary Laurel Canyon record producer, has died, which means he needs to come home to LA for the funeral against his will. Reuniting with his estranged mother Lillian becomes challenging enough, but Sam also discovers that his father left him $150,000 in his shaving kit.The catch is that it comes with instructions to deliver the cash to an 11-year-old named Josh, who happens to be the son of Frankie, a half-sister he didn't know he had. Tempted to keep the cash himself, Sam finds Frankie and follows her to an AA meeting where she shares the sudden news of her father's death and the hurtful anger she feels for not being publicly acknowledged as his daughter. Her pain is what becomes the common bond that she and Sam share and the beginning of a web of lies he tells her in order to build upon his newly discovered family ties. It's this thread of deception that propels Kurtzman's storyline, and the moment you start to feel the movie get phony, he manages to get it back on track through the burgeoning relationship that forms between Sam, Frankie and Josh. Of course, the further Sam delays in telling the truth, the more catastrophic the results. Perceptive performances are critical in pulling off this kind of drama, and Kurtzman coaxes strong work from his cast.Chris Pine captures Sam's manic energy and evasive nature to a T, and he manages to reveal the vulnerability underneath that shows he never quite gave up on his quest for his father's approval and love. Still etched in my memory as the hot-to-trot bookstore clerk inThe 40-Year-Old Virgin, Elizabeth Banks has matured as an actress and delivers a genuinely empathetic performance as Frankie, a single mother struggling with a hardscrabble life and a smart, troublemaking son. She and Pine manage a nice rapport that skirts the incest minefield that could have occurred in lesser hands. Too long off the screen and still looking like People Magazine's most beautiful woman, Michelle Pfeiffer makes her few scenes count as the newly widowed Lillian, who met Jerry back in the seventies when she was a former hatcheck girl at the Troubadour and dreamed of becoming the next Joni Mitchell. She succinctly shares her anger toward Sam for his indifference toward Jerry while slowly revealing her own secrets and fears. As the precocious Josh, Michael Hall D'Addario is given lines only an 11-year-old in a mainstream movie would speak, but he is such a likeable young actor that he manages to come across as authentic.Olivia Wilde has a thankless role as Sam's put-upon girlfriend Hannah, but she provides more depth than the plot device she represents, while indie mainstay Mark Duplass (Humpday) seems to be showing up everywhere these days, this time as Frankie's conveniently available downstairs neighbor. There are cameos from familiar character actor Philip Baker Hall (50/50) as Jerry's attorney friend and Jon Favreau as Sam's belligerent boss. A.R. Rahman (Slumdog Millionaire) provides the original music, while cinematographer Salvatore Totino (The Da Vinci Code) really captures the vibrancy of LA life beyond the stereotypical images. Kurtzman sometimes abuses quick cuts to emphasize Sam's restlessness, but when the truth is revealed in the story, it reinforces the message he sincerely conveys in appreciating the value of family and the importance of forgiveness. His clever use of home movies to bring this message home results in the heartbreaking impact that was obviously intended. I definitely recommend this surprising movie.",4,"A Contrived Concept Makes Way for a Surprisingly Worthwhile, Emotionally Resonant Drama",1349568000,"10 7, 2012",2012,4301,"['studio', 'picture', 'premise', 'contrived', 'should', ""n't"", 'work', '2012', 'family', 'drama', 'ways', 'are', 'quite', 'unexpected', 'emotionally', 'resonant', 'palpable', 'level', 'truthfulness', 'emerges', 'characters', 'even', 'plot', 'teeters', 'precariously', 'credibility', 'issues', 'First-time', 'filmmaker', 'Alex', 'Kurtzman', 'go-to', 'screenwriter', 'uber-action', 'fare', 'likeStar', 'TrekandMission', 'Impossible', 'III', 'based', 'personal', 'movie', 'events', 'own', 'life', 'when', 'met', 'own', 'half-sister', 'first', 'time', 'turned', 'thirty', 'plot', 'Sam', 'slick', '31-year-old', 'huckster', 'salesman', 'bartering', 'business', 'Just', 'snagged', 'bad', 'deal', 'huge', 'bonus', 'just', 'secured', 'pay', 'off', 'long-standing', 'debts', 'Sam', 'out', 'father', 'Jerry', 'Harper', 'legendary', 'Laurel', 'Canyon', 'record', 'producer', 'died', 'come', 'home', 'LA', 'funeral', 'will', 'Reuniting', 'estranged', 'mother', 'Lillian', 'challenging', 'enough', 'Sam', 'also', 'father', 'left', '150,000', 'shaving', 'kit.The', 'catch', 'instructions', 'deliver', 'cash', '11-year-old', 'named', 'Josh', 'who', 'be', 'son', 'Frankie', 'half-sister', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'had', 'Tempted', 'keep', 'cash', 'Sam', 'Frankie', 'AA', 'meeting', 'where', 'shares', 'sudden', 'news', 'father', 'death', 'hurtful', 'anger', 'not', 'being', 'publicly', 'acknowledged', 'daughter', 'pain', 'what', 'common', 'bond', 'Sam', 'share', 'beginning', 'web', 'lies', 'order', 'build', 'newly', 'discovered', 'family', 'ties', 'thread', 'deception', 'Kurtzman', 'storyline', 'moment', 'start', 'feel', 'movie', 'get', 'phony', 'get', 'back', 'track', 'burgeoning', 'relationship', 'Sam', 'Frankie', 'Josh', 'course', 'further', 'Sam', 'delays', 'telling', 'truth', 'more', 'catastrophic', 'results', 'Perceptive', 'performances', 'are', 'critical', 'pulling', 'off', 'kind', 'drama', 'Kurtzman', 'coaxes', 'strong', 'work', 'cast.Chris', 'Pine', 'Sam', 'manic', 'energy', 'evasive', 'nature', 'T', 'reveal', 'vulnerability', 'underneath', 'never', 'quite', 'gave', 'up', 'quest', 'father', 'approval', 'love', 'Still', 'etched', 'memory', 'hot-to-trot', 'bookstore', 'clerk', 'inThe', '40-Year-Old', 'Virgin', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'matured', 'actress', 'genuinely', 'empathetic', 'performance', 'Frankie', 'single', 'mother', 'struggling', 'hardscrabble', 'life', 'smart', 'troublemaking', 'son', 'Pine', 'manage', 'nice', 'rapport', 'incest', 'minefield', 'could', 'have', 'occurred', 'lesser', 'hands', 'Too', 'long', 'screen', 'still', 'looking', 'People', 'Magazine', 'most', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'few', 'scenes', 'count', 'newly', 'widowed', 'Lillian', 'who', 'met', 'Jerry', 'back', 'seventies', 'when', 'was', 'former', 'hatcheck', 'girl', 'Troubadour', 'dreamed', 'becoming', 'next', 'Joni', 'Mitchell', 'succinctly', 'shares', 'anger', 'Sam', 'indifference', 'Jerry', 'slowly', 'revealing', 'own', 'secrets', 'fears', 'precocious', 'Josh', 'Michael', 'Hall', ""D'Addario"", 'given', 'lines', 'only', '11-year-old', 'mainstream', 'movie', 'would', 'speak', 'such', 'likeable', 'young', 'actor', 'come', 'authentic.Olivia', 'Wilde', 'thankless', 'role', 'Sam', 'put-upon', 'girlfriend', 'Hannah', 'more', 'depth', 'plot', 'device', 'indie', 'mainstay', 'Mark', 'Duplass', 'Humpday', 'be', 'showing', 'up', 'everywhere', 'days', 'time', 'Frankie', 'conveniently', 'available', 'downstairs', 'neighbor', 'are', 'cameos', 'familiar', 'character', 'actor', 'Philip', 'Baker', 'Hall', '50/50', 'Jerry', 'attorney', 'friend', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'Sam', 'belligerent', 'boss', 'A.R', 'Rahman', 'Slumdog', 'Millionaire', 'original', 'music', 'cinematographer', 'Salvatore', 'Totino', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Code', 'really', 'vibrancy', 'LA', 'life', 'stereotypical', 'images', 'Kurtzman', 'abuses', 'quick', 'cuts', 'emphasize', 'Sam', 'restlessness', 'when', 'truth', 'revealed', 'story', 'message', 'sincerely', 'conveys', 'appreciating', 'value', 'family', 'importance', 'forgiveness', 'clever', 'use', 'home', 'movies', 'bring', 'message', 'home', 'results', 'heartbreaking', 'impact', 'was', 'obviously', 'intended', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'surprising', 'movie']",N/A

1554400,A328S9RN3U5M68,B008J691HU,Grady Harp,"[1, 1]","PEOPLE LIKE US is a film that allows us to examine a grossly dysfunctional family under a microscope and in the process learn quite a bit about why family is important despite the traumas and tragedies and underlying festering of personality quirks that affect the unit. The dialogue is smart (written by director Alex Kurtzman with Roberto Orci and Jody Lambert), the pacing is fast and furious at first but as the film lingers it slows to a slow dance that makes the whole plot come together, and the cast is uniformly excellent.Sam (Chris Pine, who continues to grow as an actor) is a fast talking salesman whose antics have resulted in some financial disasters that have placed his life in the panic mode.  He lives with a bright woman Hannah (Olivia Wilde) who is on the brink of leaving him because of the mess he is creating for himself and for their relationship.  Then of course comes the phone call: Sam's father, from whom Sam has been estranged for years, has died and Hannah insists they go to the funeral - much against Sam's inclination. But return to home in Los Angeles they do and there his mother Lillian (Michelle Pfeiffer) awaits her runaway son.  Things are strained to say the least. Sam's father's lawyer (Philip Baker Hall) informs Sam that instead of Sam's expected massive inheritance from his show biz father's death he instead is awarded all of this fathers massive record collection and accoutrements: the lawyer hands Sam a shaving kit inside which is $150,000 and a note asking Sam to deliver it to `Josh Davis'. Sam sleuths the name and discovers that Josh (Michael Hall D'Addario) is the young son of Frankie (Elizabeth Banks), a recovering alcoholic who happens to share Sam's father from a clandestine relationship the father had in the old days. Sam needs the money but he also sees the need for Josh to inherit the money to make up for the wretched life Frankie has endured due to the father's denying her existence. The remainder of the film is the working out of the secrets and truths that Sam and Frankie are brother and sister and the aspect that binds them is Sam's concern for Josh and for Frankie's future.Yes, there are errors within the film's script that confuse matters, but in the end the performances by Pine, Banks, Pfeiffer and D'Addario are so fine that little else matters.  A great movie this is not, but it IS a thoughtful film and makes the viewer rethink the concept of family.

1554404,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B008J691HU,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 2]","If you can get past that bit of folderol in which a character in the film unnecessarily withholds one crucial piece of information from another character, then PEOPLE LIKE US makes for engrossing cinema. All he had to do was tell her that she was his half-sister. But the plot conspires to throw up this and that obstacle, and so there's himself stringing her - and us - along. Still, the film is so effective in what it does and had me so riveted that this didn't dawn on me until much later.Now, maybe a plot SPOILER or two.So some days truly suck. Slick-talking ""corporate barterer"" (whatever that is) Sam Harper finds himself suddenly in deep hock and about to lose his job, what with one of his recent deals having calamitously gone bust (exploding cans of soup may have been involved). To top off his awful day, he learns that his long-estranged dad, a famous L.A. record producer, had just died. Sam fixes it so that he can miss his father's funeral, but that bit of manipulation, too, falls apart. So now he's back home in Los Angeles after all, where his life will change all over again.Imagine the bemusement Sam feels when the family lawyer meets him to go over his dad's will but then hands over a shaving kit containing $150,000. Imagine then that agonizing soul suck when Sam reads the note directing him to hand over the money to some absolute stranger. Who is Josh Davis, he who threatens to jeopardize Sam's sudden windfall?Sam Harper (Chris Pine) reminds me of any number of characters that Tom Cruise played when he was younger - the self-absorbed yuppie tool with the good looks and the smooth patter. Sam from jump set my teeth on edge. Which makes it all the more surprising that this film turns out to be unexpectedly moving. I liked it much more than I thought I would going in. It's inspired by true events in the life of writer/director Alex Kurtzman, who I am sure is more likable than his lead protagonist. It's hard to symphatize with Sam Harper, and I guess this is where the calm presence of Olivia Wilde is so key. She's terrific as Sam's good-hearted girlfriend Hannah. She earns respect by demonstrating the strength to not take guff from him. That she never quite gives up on him allows us to hope that just maybe there's something salvageable in Sam.He desperately wants to keep the money. Sam is in dire straits and he's that sort of a jerk. Is it some malnourished sense of decency then - or maybe pangs of guilt - that compels him to look in on Josh Davis on the sly? He learns that Josh is an eleven-year-old kid, and a troubled one. Still puzzling it out, he trails Josh's mom, Frankie (Elizabeth Banks), to an AA meeting, at which point he learns that Frankie is a recovering alcoholic AND also his sister.Sam Harper's go-to move, when things go fubar, is to run away. All these years he'd shunned his family. So maybe he should've thought things thru before effecting an ""accidental meet"" with Frankie. And even then it would've been a simple thing to, right then and there, let her know what's what. He doesn't, though, and we see the messy fallout to his reticence. PEOPLE LIKE US is a story about redemption and hope and reconnecting and taking on responsibility, all that good stuff. This movie is sometimes a tearjerker. It shamelessly manipulates your emotions, and I think I'm okay with that because it's done well and the actors are so good. It's gratifying to know that Chris Pine can handle a dramatic role. And Michelle Pfeiffer, she whom I'd adored ever since MARRIED TO THE MOB and THE FABULOUS BAKER BOYS? As Sam Harper's grieving mother, she is wise and pragmatic and fierce and vulnerable and a smartass. She doesn't disappoint.To me, though, Elizabeth Banks is the show. Other actresses maybe would've gone the overwrought route. But Banks from the start had the pulse of her character. On the surface, she keeps it light and a bit edgy, but you could sense the hurt and the brittleness underneath. And when she loses it finally, she manifests a powerful rawness that startles. She and Pine create such marvelous chemistry, it's a good thing we know what sort of movie this is, else you'd think their scenes are setting us up for some sizzly romance. Banks, in the audio commentary, gleefully points this out several times. By the way, if you've got the time, do watch the film with Kurtzman, Pine, and Banks' audio commentary.

This is one that I watch almost every time.  Be SURE to watch it from the very beginning.Chris Pine's character discovers when his horrible, negligent father dies that he had a family before he married his mother.  He is given money that his father saved up for the child he had previously, and Pine's character meets her at an AA meeting but wants so badly to get to know her and her son that he doesn't tell her that he is really her half brother right away.  He doesn't realize until too late what a horrible mistake it is to keep such a huge secret from her until after she and her son become quite attached to him.  Then the secret almost ruins any chance of a relationship.This movie is so good on so many levels.  It is well-written as a story about people making mistakes, people who find forgiveness in their hearts and people who find strength when a lot of us couldn't.

Only now that he's dead, does this big, big secret come out. In early June, writer/director Alex Kurtzman (""Star Trek"" 2009) told our 2012 Seattle International Film Festival audience that his heart-warming film is inspired by true events, so I'll bet he has a story to tell!Imagine how you would feel. This is the dilemma our hero faces when his father's attorney gives him a box of money with instructions about where to deliver it.We watch:* Chris Pine (""Bottle Shock"" and ""Star Trek"" 2009) is Sam, instructed by his father's will to deliver $150,000 to a sister he never knew he had. Sam is a wheeler-dealer who has hit a rough patch, so he could actually use that money himself! This is Pine's best work to date.* Elizabeth Banks (""The Hunger Games"") is Frankie, who only knows her father dropped out of her life and she never knew why. As a result, she has a pretty checkered past that only settled down after she herself became a parent.* Olivia Wilde (""The Change-Up"") is Hannah, the moral center to her husband Sam's world. She never loses sight of what is the best thing for him to do.* Michelle Pfeiffer (""Dark Shadows"") is Lillian, Sam's mother, who protected her own child to the detriment of any other. It is wonderful to see Pfeiffer playing an age-appropriate role and playing it well. Good for you, Michelle!When everyone in the cast turns in such a fine performance, we can look to the director. It seems to me that Mr. Kurtzman can direct both huge spectacles and intimate films. This one is touching, intelligent, and offers a full cast of characters for whom we come to care. No gunshots, no blowie uppie stuff, just decent people searching for a way to do the right thing. And the ending is a pleasant surprise.",4,Surprise!

Kurtzman, also with the prolific writing team of Roberto Orci (Star Trek 2009, Lost) and actor turned producer/writer Jodi Lambert (Dirty Sexy Money) created a sensitive and emotional screenplay that makes you wonder how many families out there are truly like this.Chris Pine (Star Trek 2009, Unstoppable) plays Sam and does an outstanding job with energy and emotion as the son of a now estranged father (who was a former record producer) - who because of different points of view - went their separate ways many years ago. Pine's acting chops along with a combined amazing performance by Elizabeth Banks (Zack and Miri Make A Porno, 40 Year Old Virgin) playing Frankie - who is a unannounced family member were emotionally energized with the heart ache that is family relations separated by time and distance. I am trying to be very vague as to not reveal the `story' of the story. The discovering in the films `surprise' is amazing in itself - but the performances carry you away with it all.The film has a strong opening and Kutzman and the other writers seemed to bring story points and other plot complications smack in the middle of the movie, that for me,  that drag the plot more than a little bit. By time you hit the third act....you can't take your eyes, and heart, off the screen.Another amazing performance, haunting and touching, came from Michelle Pfieffer (Hairspray, Batman Returns) as Chris mother who, has to deal with her husbands (his fathers) death and the issue of family separation and her own medical heath issues at the same time. Michelle and Chris have a riveting scene as `Mother and Son' reunite for the first time in a long time.It's got humor that mainly centers from Elizabeth's son Josh (given by an energetic performance by Michael Hall D'Addario  of Are We There Yet? and Sinister) who has some of the best key emotionally funny and heartwarming scenes that allow these separated family members to reconnect in some of the most unusual ways. Josh becomes a catalyst for a lot of the events that happen.Another stand-out performance came from Pine's girlfriend Hannah (played amazingly by Olivia Wilde (Tron: Legacy, House) who gave Pine a base from wish to sound off - and sometimes regret - his emotional needs verses his families pull on him. Again, given Chris Pine some amazingly emotionally charged scenes which he delivers with apparently such ease and simplicity.Not a bad job for Kurtzamn and his directorial debut and I am sure he will do great in future stories and humanizing them - the best thing he did was to resolve everything with a lot of heart and passion and the final scene should make the corners of your eyes more than a little moist. I haven't heard so much sniffling in the theatre since the 3-D re-release of Titanic. The difference - these are very `Happy' tears. If you can get through that middle 20 minutes of a little long-in-the-tooth drama - the ending makes up for the middle - big time.For me a great family film about a dysfunction family becoming functional again and unfortunately - the father never ends up knowing what actually happened - but who was the spark that lit the candle of love and passion to bring these two very different families together.",4,Chris Pine and Elizabeth Banks Have Passionate Chemistry!,1341187200,"07 2, 2012",2012,3436,"['MOVIE', 'REVIEW', '41', 'People', 'Us', 'Making', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Alex', 'Kurtzman', 'personal', 'introspective', 'story', 'based', 'real', 'situation', 'amazing', 'cast', 'true', 'drive', 'passion', 'Kurtzman', 'also', 'prolific', 'writing', 'team', 'Roberto', 'Orci', 'Star', 'Trek', '2009', 'Lost', 'actor', 'turned', 'producer/writer', 'Jodi', 'Lambert', 'Dirty', 'Sexy', 'Money', 'created', 'sensitive', 'emotional', 'screenplay', 'wonder', 'how', 'many', 'families', 'are', 'truly', 'this.Chris', 'Pine', 'Star', 'Trek', '2009', 'Unstoppable', 'Sam', 'outstanding', 'job', 'energy', 'emotion', 'son', 'now', 'estranged', 'father', 'who', 'was', 'former', 'record', 'producer', 'who', 'different', 'points', 'view', 'went', 'separate', 'ways', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'Pine', 'acting', 'chops', 'combined', 'amazing', 'performance', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'Zack', 'Miri', 'Make', 'A', 'Porno', '40', 'Year', 'Old', 'Virgin', 'playing', 'Frankie', 'who', 'unannounced', 'family', 'member', 'were', 'emotionally', 'energized', 'heart', 'ache', 'family', 'relations', 'separated', 'time', 'distance', 'am', 'trying', 'be', 'very', 'vague', 'not', 'reveal', 'story', 'story', 'discovering', 'films', 'surprise', 'amazing', 'performances', 'carry', 'away', 'film', 'strong', 'opening', 'Kutzman', 'other', 'writers', 'seemed', 'bring', 'story', 'points', 'other', 'plot', 'complications', 'smack', 'middle', 'movie', 'drag', 'plot', 'more', 'little', 'bit', 'time', 'hit', 'third', 'act', '.you', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'eyes', 'heart', 'screen.Another', 'amazing', 'performance', 'haunting', 'touching', 'came', 'Michelle', 'Pfieffer', 'Hairspray', 'Batman', 'Returns', 'Chris', 'mother', 'who', 'deal', 'husbands', 'fathers', 'death', 'issue', 'family', 'separation', 'own', 'medical', 'heath', 'issues', 'same', 'time', 'Michelle', 'Chris', 'have', 'riveting', 'scene', 'Mother', 'Son', 'reunite', 'first', 'time', 'long', 'time.It', 'got', 'humor', 'mainly', 'centers', 'Elizabeth', 'son', 'Josh', 'given', 'energetic', 'performance', 'Michael', 'Hall', ""D'Addario"", 'Are', 'Yet', 'Sinister', 'who', 'best', 'key', 'emotionally', 'funny', 'heartwarming', 'scenes', 'allow', 'separated', 'family', 'members', 'reconnect', 'most', 'unusual', 'ways', 'Josh', 'catalyst', 'lot', 'events', 'happen.Another', 'stand-out', 'performance', 'came', 'Pine', 'girlfriend', 'Hannah', 'played', 'amazingly', 'Olivia', 'Wilde', 'Tron', 'Legacy', 'House', 'who', 'gave', 'Pine', 'base', 'wish', 'sound', 'off', 'sometimes', 'regret', 'emotional', 'needs', 'families', 'pull', 'Again', 'given', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'amazingly', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'scenes', 'apparently', 'such', 'ease', 'simplicity.Not', 'bad', 'job', 'Kurtzamn', 'directorial', 'debut', 'am', 'sure', 'will', 'do', 'great', 'future', 'stories', 'humanizing', 'best', 'thing', 'did', 'was', 'resolve', 'everything', 'lot', 'heart', 'passion', 'final', 'scene', 'should', 'make', 'corners', 'eyes', 'more', 'little', 'moist', 'have', ""n't"", 'heard', 'so', 'much', 'sniffling', 'theatre', '3-D', 're-release', 'Titanic', 'difference', 'are', 'very', 'Happy', 'tears', 'can', 'get', 'middle', '20', 'minutes', 'little', 'long-in-the-tooth', 'drama', 'ending', 'up', 'middle', 'big', 'time.For', 'great', 'family', 'film', 'dysfunction', 'family', 'becoming', 'functional', 'again', 'unfortunately', 'father', 'never', 'up', 'knowing', 'what', 'actually', 'happened', 'who', 'was', 'spark', 'lit', 'candle', 'love', 'passion', 'bring', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'families', 'together']",N/A

Sam (very good Chris Pine) is the half-brother, unaware of his sibling.  Sam's relationship with his parents and especially his dad is strained to say the least.  He also has financial problems as well as some legal issues that arose from some business mismanagement.When Sam discovers that his father wanted him to deliver a large amount of cash to his unknown before now nephew and sister, he balks.  Why doesn't he just keep it?  He decides to learn more about the pair, and discovers that despite their quirks and differences, he wants to give them the money.  Unfortunately it takes him forever to drop the bomb and we all know, the longer it takes the bigger the explosion.The other concern is that we can see Frankie falling for Sam.  For his part Pine does his best to pull off the role, but really...why?  In spite of this procrastination of the tell, the film has a great heart, some nice acting and a satisfactory conclusion.

This is a film about the lack of dynamics in family relationships. A father removed from his son and from other people.Sam is called home to California because his father has died. He is a salesman trying to make a living, but deep in debt. His girlfriend, Hannah , played by Olivia Wilde has no idea about his finances, And, it seems Sam has kept a lot from her. They arrive late for the funeral, an upset mother, and try to settle in. Sam is asked to meet with the family attorney, and learns he has a half sister and his dad has left her $150,000 dollars. Now, the deceit begins, trying to find out who his sister, Frankie, played by Elizabeth Banks,  really is. They become friends, and the deceit continues. The film has a wonderful,storyline, but it goes on far too long. Secrets prevail in this family, no one really talks to each other. Yes, we have been there, done that.  Elizabeth Banks really livens up this film, she brings action and emotion. She is left out of the secrets for far too long.

Film Critic, 15-year-old Raven Devanney shares her review below:People like us is a heartfelt drama about a man who's life takes a turn for the worst and in unsuspecting events leads him to a sister he never knew he had. This film was exceptional. It stars Elizabeth Banks, Chris Pine and Michelle Pfeiffer. People like us made me laugh, cry and feel every emotion in between.The visuals in this film were great and the acting was superb. My favorite character was Frankie played by Elizabeth Banks because her performance was so solid and she definitely carried the comedy of this film as well as the heavier emotions. My favorite part of this film is when Sam played by Chris Pine is getting to know Frankie and her young son because I enjoyed watching their bond grow.It really bothered me that Sam wouldn't tell Frankie who he was until the end of the film because it just complicated their lives, but it gave the film a much needed twist. I recommend this film for ages 13 and up because of adult content and younger children may have a more difficult time fallowing along with the plot.

Bluray has lots more bonuses.Writers Alex Kurtzman and Jody Lambert are best know for their work on Star Trek and Transformers films than ""human personal dramas"" but, when Kurtzman learned that he had a cousin he never knew existed it sparked an idea which became this film which the package promotes as ""from the studio that brought you THE HELP"". Like that film, this one will will generate a lot of ""referrals from friends"" and by word of mouth. While not - as the package also states - ""one of the Year's Very Best"" (hey there's a lot of competition out there), it is engrossing and takes some interesting twists and turns, even when the ending seems almost certain.I see someone prior to me has already posted a ""spoiler"" which not stating that as their title. But, trust me, there's still another ""turn of events"" after that - which I didn't see coming. I will say no more about that.Though it's not apparent from either the advertising or the packaging,  records (you know those flat discs before CDs), especially 70s rock bands, play an important pop culture part of the film. Like the famous record scene in ""Diner"" or much of ""High Fidelity"", the music discussions in this film will ring true with anyone who was collecting during those days.The DVD version comes with ONE audio commentary with Kurtzman (who directed the film, as well as co-wrote it) and actors Elizabeth Banks and Chris Pine, plus selected scene commentary with Michelle Pfeiffer, who plays Pine's mother. The Bluray combo-pack includes the above plus some really useful bonus features like the 14-minute featurette on the story behind the film (where I learned the info in the first part of my review), a 5 minute ""extended scene in the taco shop"" (you'll understand when you see the film), the now-requisite ""blooper reel"" (4-minutes) and 18 minutes of deleted scenes (with helpful introductions by Kurtzman) which are well worth seeing. There's also ANOTHER full-length audio commentary with Kurtzman and Lambert. I did not listen to any of the three audio commentaries so I can't comment on them, but - for those with the time - they are there.Hidden in the script are what Pine's character calls "" The Six Rules"". You need to get nearly through the film to learn what they are but they really are useful. In fact, I wrote them down and have re-read them over the past day or two. I think many of you might as well. Give this film a chance. It's worth your time.

1554470,A3D6KZT0QG6UKB,B008J691HU,"Tim Lieder ""Founder of Dybbuk Press""","[1, 1]","One of the most common jokes about horror movies is that 90% of them are based on the characters being dumber than rocks. Even if the characters seem nominally intelligent, they tend to run into the woods, trip over their feet, go down into the spooky cellar, try petting the weird snake thing, etc.As much as this movie strives to be about decent people trying to make their lives better with moments of kindness and decency, there's a good portion of this movie that is based on people having secrets and keeping those secrets. This plot device means that the characters need to act incredibly stupid and deceptive. Instead of just going ""ok, here's the deal..."" the character lies and keeps things in the dark for most of the movie until it's absolutely necessary and then the standard scene happens.There's a real sweetness to this movie, but that stupid plot device places everything in a formula that would hinders the naturalness of the performances and the plot.",3,Plot devices nearly kill the movie,1379203200,"09 15, 2013",2013,970,"['One', 'most', 'common', 'jokes', 'horror', 'movies', '90', '%', 'are', 'based', 'characters', 'being', 'dumber', 'rocks', 'Even', 'characters', 'seem', 'nominally', 'intelligent', 'tend', 'run', 'woods', 'trip', 'feet', 'go', 'down', 'spooky', 'cellar', 'try', 'petting', 'weird', 'snake', 'thing', 'etc.As', 'much', 'movie', 'be', 'decent', 'people', 'trying', 'make', 'lives', 'better', 'moments', 'kindness', 'decency', 'good', 'portion', 'movie', 'based', 'people', 'having', 'secrets', 'keeping', 'secrets', 'plot', 'device', 'characters', 'need', 'act', 'incredibly', 'stupid', 'deceptive', 'Instead', 'just', 'going', 'ok', 'here', 'deal', 'character', 'things', 'dark', 'most', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'necessary', 'then', 'standard', 'scene', 'real', 'sweetness', 'movie', 'stupid', 'plot', 'device', 'places', 'everything', 'formula', 'would', 'hinders', 'naturalness', 'performances', 'plot']",N/A

The only reason it didn't merit five stars for me was that we found ourselves yelling, ""Tell her!"" at the screen about 2/3s of the way in.

Sam (Pine) just closed a huge deal at his job and has a commission of over $80,000 coming. His boss though as just informed him that he messed up the shipping and his entire commission is being taken from him and he may be sued. To top it off he comes home to find out that his father died. Reluctantly he returns home for the funeral where he is told that he has a sister and is to give $150,000 to her son. Sam is stuck between needing the money for himself or giving it to someone he doesn't even know. This is a very good movie that deserves to be seen by a bigger audience then it will get. This is a movie that is a solely character driven piece and only works if you believe the characters and their motives. The actors are so good in this that it is very easy to trust them. I recommend this movie but it is one you must be in the mood for. Overall, the movie is depressing, heartfelt, moving, inspiring and very much worth seeing.
