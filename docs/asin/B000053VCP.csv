Even though I find Baby Bear 10 times more annoying than Elmo, I can sit through this one as much as my toddler wants. It's also an excellent showcase of DVD technology with the interactive games and other special features on this disc. One minor issue I have with it though is the menu that requires two selections to get anywhere. (Almost as annoying as an ""Are you Sure?"" dialog box).",5,An excellent multimedia DVD,1044662400,"02 8, 2003",2003,434,"['Great', 'fun', 'toddlers', 'older', 'kids', 'adults', 'Even', 'find', 'Baby', 'Bear', '10', 'times', 'more', 'annoying', 'Elmo', 'can', 'sit', 'one', 'as', 'much', 'toddler', 'also', 'excellent', 'showcase', 'DVD', 'technology', 'interactive', 'games', 'other', 'special', 'features', 'disc', 'One', 'minor', 'issue', 'have', 'menu', 'two', 'selections', 'get', 'anywhere', 'Almost', 'as', 'annoying', 'Are', 'Sure', 'dialog', 'box']",Sesame Street Presents Elmo's Musical Adventures - Peter & The Wolf VHS

It's very educational and entertaining.  How many kids' dvd's can you say that about?To any and all Muppet fans of all ages, this is a instant classic.

He seems especially amused by seeing familiar characters like Elmo, Telly, and Zoe ""disguised"" as Peter, the Duck, and the Bird.  The Wolf is growly without being too scary for a little one.  The actors who play the musicians are really appealing -- the only false note is Keith Lockhart's incredibly stiff performance.  But he is a conductor, after all, not an actor, so that doesn't matter to my toddler, who sits enraptured through the whole thing, singing along with Elmo and his band, and then wants to see it again.

[We have owned this tape for about 2 years.]As we were going along my 3 year-old son was humming various --and appropriate!-- sections of the music that corresponded to the action on the page.In addition, my 5 year-old daughter was telling me about what instrument was used to portray the characters.  When I was humming she reminded me that I should try to sound more like an oboe (for the duck).So Five BIG Stars for this video.
