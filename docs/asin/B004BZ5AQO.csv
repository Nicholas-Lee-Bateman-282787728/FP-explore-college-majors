Mitch and Sara want to take their daughter Christina out to a cabin in the country to celebrate her birthday. It's a new cabin Mitch had built over Sara's old childhood home. The place is haunted by some Grudge-esque ghosts wandering around. I won't spoil the ending, but let's just say it ain't worth the trip.There are some issues with the soundtrack. First of all, there was a weird buzzing and hissing present throughout many of the scenes. Also, whoever created the score was under the impression that this was a real nail-biter, and the most dramatic of dramas. Totally over the top! The only thing missing was a wacky zinger sound effect from the waking-up-from-a-dream, from a dream, from a dream scene.",1,The Opposite of Ominous,1361318400,"02 20, 2013",2013,772,"['Ok', 'birthday', 'cake', 'scene', 'was', 'kind', 'ominous', 'got', 'Mitch', 'Sara', 'want', 'take', 'daughter', 'Christina', 'cabin', 'country', 'celebrate', 'birthday', 'new', 'cabin', 'Mitch', 'had', 'built', 'Sara', 'old', 'childhood', 'home', 'place', 'haunted', 'Grudge-esque', 'ghosts', 'wandering', 'around', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'ending', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'ai', ""n't"", 'are', 'issues', 'soundtrack', 'First', 'all', 'was', 'weird', 'buzzing', 'hissing', 'present', 'many', 'scenes', 'Also', 'whoever', 'created', 'score', 'was', 'impression', 'was', 'real', 'nail-biter', 'most', 'dramatic', 'dramas', 'Totally', 'top', 'only', 'thing', 'missing', 'was', 'wacky', 'zinger', 'sound', 'effect', 'waking-up-from-a-dream', 'dream', 'dream', 'scene']",Ominous
