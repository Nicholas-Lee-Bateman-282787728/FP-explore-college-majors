He frequently returns to the beloved Cheyenne, the Human Beings, as if for a respite from the crazy whites.

That's an apt summation used to promote the film in 1970. Cinematic exaggeration or not, it doesn't really matter too much.""Little Big Man"" offers something for every one. It's a masterpiece of absurdity and dark humour. It's a satirical film on revisionist history. It's a social commentary on the plight of the American Indian. Regardless of one's perspective, ""Little Big Man"" is comedy at its best. The (mis)adventures and lessons of Jack Crabb a.k.a. Little Big Man (Dustin Hoffman) in the old west will have you roaring with laughter, yet at the same time celebrating his triumphs as an underdog who overcame the challenges faced in his supposed 121 years.Dustin Hoffman shows off his versatility and depth as an actor by portraying Jack Crabb the Cheyenne brave, the storekeeper, the army scout, the born-again religionist, the travelling medicine man, the drunk, the hermit and the gunfighter. Robert Mulligan as an egotistical General George Armstrong Custer is equally good in his role and just as hilarious. Chief Dan George (Crabb's adopted grandfather - Old Lodge Skins) and Faye Dunaway (the minister's wife and fallen flower - Mrs. Pendrake) deliver fine performances and are a delight to watch too.To add authenticity to the old west, part of ""Little Big Man"" was filmed around Bighorn National Park, Montana. The sound track features some nice blues guitar.As a footnote to the film, a factual Little Big Man did exist. He lived in the period represented in the film, but all similarity ends there. He was an Oglala Lakota who fought alongside Crazy Horse against Bear Coat Miles. He opposed the treaty and the commission that wanted to take the Black Hills from the Sioux.

Thanks to those who do this.I can't believe I am the first to review this Blu-Ray (it was released on Tuesday the 8th, and this is 11/13/2011).The video quality varied.  The beginning had a lot of grain, which soon disappeared.  I sit about 7 feet away from a 52"" LCD, and I didn't notice any grain during most of the movie.  The lowest rating I have ever given to a Blu-Ray movie was 4.0 on a 10.0 scale.  The beginning was about a 6.5.  Most of the movie was about 8.5.  Some of the indoor shots were about 9.5.  Overall, very good for a movie made in 1970.I was happy to see that there was DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio; it just wasn't that good.  They didn't put much effort into the surround sound.The movie lasted 2 hours and 19 minutes.  I believe the aspect ration is 2.40:1, but it could be 2.35:1.  I was glad to see the widescreen format, instead of the 1.77:1 that is listed in the product description.  The movie had credits at the end.  The only person in the cast that I recognized, besides Dustin Hoffman, Faye Dunaway, and Chief Dan George, was E. Emmett Walsh, who was the ""Shot Gun Guard"".

229679,A3OEECMCM2T4KQ,6300251012,C. Middleton,"[3, 3]","Adapted to the screen from the Thomas Berger novel, Little Big Man tells the sweeping story of Jack Crabb (Dustin Hoffman) told by the character himself interviewed in an old folks home as a centenarian. (Well over 100 years of age).If there was one word to describe this film it would have to be charming, because it crosses many genres: drama, comedy, western, adventure, war, historical, biographical etc. One of the top twenty films made in the seventies, aside from The Godfather & Godfather 2, this movie would have to be one of the most memorable.Jack Crabb's story of his life is a collection of anecdotes from the time he was kidnapped by Indians and raised as one of their own, to then be thrown back into the ""white"" mans world.Really this film reveals the American Indians' civil and sane view of life over the white man's narrow and aggressive natures during that time.Leaving his tribe, Jack Crabb is placed with the Pendrake family, the father is the town's paster and his beautiful though sexually frustrated wife played wonderfully by the beautiful Faye Dunaway. It is here, witnessing Mrs. Louise Pendrakes adulterous nature that he first begins to discover the insanities and hypocrisies of the ""white man"".The saddest part of the film is Crabb's return to the Cheyenne, where he marries a lovely squaw and eventually has a child.It is here he reunites with ""Grandfather"" or ""Old Lodge Skins"" (Chief Dan George) who deservedly won the Oscar that year for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. The only way to describe ""grandfather"" is wise, simple, funny and confused about the white man's ways. He asks Little Big Man many questions about the white man's behaviour and customs and Jack Crabb, most of the time, does not have an answer.The United States Calvary one morning descends upon the native village and massacres every man, woman and child. This raid was led by the infamous George Armstrong Custer, (Richard Mulligan) and is based on true historical events. Crabb's wife and baby are brutally killed by the soldiers though Crabb escapes to return to the white man's world as a drunk.Many mishaps and circumstances finally lead Crabb to join the Seventh Calvary under Custer's command as a scout, and is known in the regiment as ""mule skinner"". It is here that Crabb seeks revenge for the murder of his family.Grabb takes part in the famous battle of The Little Big Horn, as the soldiers are massacred, his life is saved once again because of an Indian from his past recognizes him before he is scalped.My favourite and more than likely the funniest scene in the film is ""Grandfather's"" death, where he ""knows"" it is time for him to die and move to a better place. He lies down, closes his eyes and it begins to rain. He opens his eyes and asks if he has arrived to the great pastures...funny yet heartfelt.It has been said that the seventies was the decade where good filmmaking lost its way.Viewing Little Big Man once again, this statement is false beyond a doubt.""Little Big Man"" is a truly great film to own and view time and again.",5,One of most Memorable Films of the 70's,1194566400,"11 9, 2007",2007,3059,"['Adapted', 'screen', 'Thomas', 'Berger', 'novel', 'Little', 'Big', 'Man', 'sweeping', 'story', 'Jack', 'Crabb', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'told', 'character', 'interviewed', 'old', 'folks', 'home', 'centenarian', 'Well', '100', 'years', 'age', '.If', 'was', 'one', 'word', 'describe', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'charming', 'many', 'genres', 'drama', 'comedy', 'western', 'adventure', 'war', 'historical', 'biographical', 'etc', 'One', 'top', 'twenty', 'films', 'made', 'seventies', 'aside', 'Godfather', 'Godfather', '2', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'memorable.Jack', 'Crabb', 'story', 'life', 'collection', 'anecdotes', 'time', 'was', 'kidnapped', 'Indians', 'raised', 'one', 'own', 'then', 'be', 'thrown', 'back', 'white', 'mans', 'world.Really', 'film', 'American', 'Indians', 'civil', 'sane', 'view', 'life', 'white', 'man', 'narrow', 'aggressive', 'natures', 'time.Leaving', 'tribe', 'Jack', 'Crabb', 'placed', 'Pendrake', 'family', 'father', 'town', 'paster', 'beautiful', 'sexually', 'frustrated', 'wife', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'beautiful', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'here', 'witnessing', 'Mrs.', 'Louise', 'Pendrakes', 'adulterous', 'nature', 'first', 'discover', 'insanities', 'hypocrisies', 'white', 'man', 'saddest', 'part', 'film', 'Crabb', 'return', 'Cheyenne', 'where', 'lovely', 'squaw', 'eventually', 'child.It', 'here', 'Grandfather', 'Old', 'Lodge', 'Skins', 'Chief', 'Dan', 'George', 'who', 'deservedly', 'won', 'Oscar', 'year', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Supporting', 'Role', 'only', 'way', 'describe', 'grandfather', 'wise', 'simple', 'funny', 'confused', 'white', 'man', 'ways', 'Little', 'Big', 'Man', 'many', 'questions', 'white', 'man', 'behaviour', 'customs', 'Jack', 'Crabb', 'most', 'time', 'not', 'have', 'answer.The', 'United', 'States', 'Calvary', 'one', 'morning', 'native', 'village', 'massacres', 'man', 'woman', 'child', 'raid', 'was', 'led', 'infamous', 'George', 'Armstrong', 'Custer', 'Richard', 'Mulligan', 'based', 'true', 'historical', 'events', 'Crabb', 'wife', 'baby', 'are', 'brutally', 'killed', 'soldiers', 'Crabb', 'return', 'white', 'man', 'world', 'drunk.Many', 'mishaps', 'circumstances', 'finally', 'lead', 'Crabb', 'join', 'Seventh', 'Calvary', 'Custer', 'command', 'scout', 'known', 'regiment', 'mule', 'skinner', 'here', 'Crabb', 'revenge', 'murder', 'family.Grabb', 'part', 'famous', 'battle', 'Little', 'Big', 'Horn', 'soldiers', 'are', 'massacred', 'life', 'saved', 'once', 'again', 'Indian', 'past', 'scalped.My', 'favourite', 'more', 'likely', 'funniest', 'scene', 'film', 'Grandfather', 'death', 'where', 'time', 'die', 'move', 'better', 'place', 'down', 'eyes', 'rain', 'eyes', 'asks', 'arrived', 'great', 'pastures', 'funny', 'yet', 'heartfelt.It', 'been', 'said', 'seventies', 'was', 'decade', 'where', 'good', 'filmmaking', 'lost', 'way.Viewing', 'Little', 'Big', 'Man', 'once', 'again', 'statement', 'false', 'doubt', 'Little', 'Big', 'Man', 'truly', 'great', 'film', 'own', 'view', 'time', 'again']",N/A

THE ARRIVAL (sci-fi, 1996) Obsessed with discovering extraterrestrial life radio astronomer Zane (Charlie Sheen) devotes his time to scanning the universe for any trace. Then suddenly a strange signal is picked up. He  takes the evidence to project leader Giordan (Ron Silver). Without any  reason Giordan dismisses the sounds as fake and inexplicably closes down  the project. But Zane doesn't give up and continues the project on his own  terms. Setting up a house-made station he picks the signal up again and  finds the origin as being in Mexico. He sets out to find the mysterious  source.Critique: Once in a while the sci-fi genre produces a film that  to some extent redeems it self of some of the saddest, and most absurd  efforts ever filmed. The Arrival is one of those films and one of the  smartest too. Writer-Director David Twohy is better known for screenwriting  some nifty action films (e.g. 'The Fugitive'). But with this, his first  directorial effort, he completely departed the genre he seemed to be best  at. The result is an intriguing combination of high wire, action-packed  scenes, with some 50s-type 'cold war' movie cliches. Similarities to the  classic &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot; can easily be made.  Charlie Sheen is credible enough as the hectic Zane, as is Ron Silver in  the role of villain (characters that he has specialized in portraying). But  as in most futuristic thrillers the visual and make-up effects is the real  draw card here. After years of churning out creatures and 'aliens' of all  sorts and shapes we are still surprised by some uniquely designed  creations. Best of all every situation and special effect employed do serve  a purpose and are not only thrown in for genre's sake (watch for the  funky-rotating-vacuum-alien-ball). Let's hope David Twohy has another  sci-fi project up his sleeve.QUOTES: Giordan: &quot;If you can't tend to  your own planet none of you deserve to live here.&quot;",4,CULT MOVIES 54,917913600,"02 2, 1999",1999,1966,"['54', 'ARRIVAL', 'sci-fi', '1996', 'Obsessed', 'discovering', 'extraterrestrial', 'life', 'radio', 'astronomer', 'Zane', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'time', 'scanning', 'universe', 'trace', 'Then', 'suddenly', 'strange', 'signal', 'picked', 'up', 'evidence', 'project', 'leader', 'Giordan', 'Ron', 'Silver', 'reason', 'Giordan', 'sounds', 'fake', 'inexplicably', 'closes', 'down', 'project', 'Zane', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'project', 'own', 'terms', 'Setting', 'up', 'house-made', 'station', 'signal', 'up', 'again', 'origin', 'being', 'Mexico', 'out', 'find', 'mysterious', 'source.Critique', 'Once', 'sci-fi', 'genre', 'film', 'extent', 'self', 'saddest', 'most', 'absurd', 'efforts', 'ever', 'filmed', 'Arrival', 'one', 'films', 'one', 'smartest', 'too', 'Writer-Director', 'David', 'Twohy', 'better', 'known', 'screenwriting', 'nifty', 'action', 'films', 'e.g', 'Fugitive', 'first', 'directorial', 'effort', 'completely', 'departed', 'genre', 'seemed', 'be', 'best', 'result', 'intriguing', 'combination', 'high', 'wire', 'action-packed', 'scenes', '50s-type', ""'cold"", 'war', 'movie', 'cliches', 'Similarities', 'classic', 'quot', 'Invasion', 'Body', 'Snatchers', 'quot', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'made', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'credible', 'enough', 'hectic', 'Zane', 'Ron', 'Silver', 'role', 'villain', 'characters', 'specialized', 'portraying', 'most', 'futuristic', 'thrillers', 'visual', 'make-up', 'effects', 'real', 'draw', 'card', 'here', 'years', 'churning', 'out', 'creatures', ""'aliens"", 'sorts', 'shapes', 'are', 'still', 'surprised', 'uniquely', 'designed', 'creations', 'Best', 'situation', 'special', 'effect', 'employed', 'do', 'serve', 'purpose', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'thrown', 'genre', 'sake', 'watch', 'funky-rotating-vacuum-alien-ball', 'Let', 'hope', 'David', 'Twohy', 'sci-fi', 'project', 'sleeve.QUOTES', 'Giordan', 'quot', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tend', 'own', 'planet', 'none', 'deserve', 'live', 'here.', 'quot']",N/A

229683,A315K47GRB024C,6300251012,Daniel C. Markel,"[2, 2]","This review is for the 2003 Paramount DVD.Dustin Hoffman stars as Jack Crabb, a 121-year-old man who has a lot of stories to tell about his life as a boy and a young man in the Wild West.  He flashes back to when he was 10 years old and tells how he and his older sister were the only survivors of a hostile Indian attack, and was later rescued and taken in by a different Indian tribe.  From that point on, Crabb launches a long narrative story of incredible proportions with tales about living with Indians, western pioneers and even famous historical figures like General George Custer and Wild Bill Hickok.This film was made in 1970 and it's clearly more ""contemporary"" than westerns of the `40's and `50's.  First, there's clearly more sexual discussion and activity but none of it is graphic.  Also, it gives a lot more insight to the Indian tribal culture than I can ever recall seeing in a movie of this genre - far better than 'Dances With Wolves'.  Also, there's clearly more of a comedy element in this film compared to the westerns of years past.  I've never been a big fan of Dustin Hoffman, but I will say this is by far his best role and best movie.  The film does seem to have some political/social commentary such as typically portraying whites as the oppressors and Indians as the victims (I'm part native American - so I'm not biased either way).  But in spite of these minor criticisms, it's a terrific film and I strongly recommend it.  The cinematography of rural Montana and Western Canada is stunning!The DVD quality is great.  The widescreen picture is sharp, colorful and clean and the sound is excellent for a movie made in 1970.  There are no extra bonuses, which is a major shame for a film of this quality.Movie: A-DVD Quality:  A",5,A superbly entertaining western!,1135209600,"12 22, 2005",2005,1760,"['review', '2003', 'Paramount', 'DVD.Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Jack', 'Crabb', '121-year-old', 'man', 'who', 'lot', 'stories', 'tell', 'life', 'boy', 'young', 'man', 'Wild', 'West', 'back', 'when', 'was', '10', 'years', 'old', 'how', 'older', 'sister', 'were', 'only', 'survivors', 'hostile', 'Indian', 'attack', 'was', 'later', 'rescued', 'taken', 'different', 'Indian', 'tribe', 'point', 'Crabb', 'long', 'narrative', 'story', 'incredible', 'proportions', 'tales', 'living', 'Indians', 'western', 'pioneers', 'even', 'famous', 'historical', 'figures', 'General', 'George', 'Custer', 'Wild', 'Bill', 'Hickok.This', 'film', 'was', 'made', '1970', 'clearly', 'more', 'contemporary', 'westerns', '40', '50', 'First', 'clearly', 'more', 'sexual', 'discussion', 'activity', 'none', 'graphic', 'Also', 'lot', 'more', 'insight', 'Indian', 'tribal', 'culture', 'can', 'ever', 'recall', 'seeing', 'movie', 'genre', 'far', 'better', ""'Dances"", 'Wolves', 'Also', 'clearly', 'more', 'comedy', 'element', 'film', 'compared', 'westerns', 'years', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'will', 'say', 'far', 'best', 'role', 'best', 'movie', 'film', 'seem', 'have', 'political/social', 'commentary', 'such', 'typically', 'portraying', 'whites', 'oppressors', 'Indians', 'victims', ""'m"", 'part', 'native', 'American', 'so', ""'m"", 'not', 'biased', 'way', 'spite', 'minor', 'criticisms', 'terrific', 'film', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'cinematography', 'rural', 'Montana', 'Western', 'Canada', 'stunning', 'DVD', 'quality', 'great', 'widescreen', 'picture', 'sharp', 'colorful', 'clean', 'sound', 'excellent', 'movie', 'made', '1970', 'are', 'extra', 'bonuses', 'major', 'shame', 'film', 'quality.Movie', 'A-DVD', 'Quality']",N/A

Director Arthur Penn's sweeping film depicting the clash of the Indian and white cultures will have you chuckling one moment, then shaking your head sadly at man's inhumanity to man the next.Dustin Hoffman as the ever industrious Jack Crabb takes this movie on his shoulders and carries it superbly.  To say that the actor shows some &quot;range&quot; in this role is the epitome of an understatement:  from portraying an adolescent teenager to a fragile 121-year-old-man (phenomenal makeup job), from snake-oil salesman to mule skinner, Hoffman brings Jack's fascinating life to splendorous glory.  And Hoffman is funny--darn funny--with a wonderful knack for physical comedy.In addition to Hoffman, LITTLE BIG MAN offers other savory treats.  Richard Mulligan is absolutely delightful as a narcissistic General George Armstrong Custer--the stunning Faye Dunaway positively wicked as naughty Mrs. Pendrake.  Chief Dan George, who portrays Old Lodge Skins, Jack's adopted Cheyenne grandfather, delivers countless one-liners, yet lends a quiet, heartfelt dignity to his role.  In fact, this is a movie one will wish to savor again and again--a beautifully crafted, well-made film that is timeless in its ability to entertain.--D.

229702,A3A4WQL80WOTMH,6300251012,Green Manalishi,"[2, 2]","A happy/sad movie slash history lesson in the guise of an old man recalling his younger days growing up in the old west.  The scenes between Jack Crabb (Hoffman) and Gen Custer were my favorite.  The actor who played Custer was hilarious and perfectly cast for the part.  Actually all the acting and scenes in this movie were well-done.  I thought it started out kind of slow at first but found I was getting right into it after a little while.  This movie could probably be most appreciated by anyone familiar with the famous/infamous figures of the the American old west, and the movie is something of a marvel in that it seems to bring the old stories alive through the (tall?) tale of the narrator (Jack Crabb) who at one time or another seemed to have crossed paths with all of them.  As a testament to the rape of Native American culture this film is very moving, as the on-screen recreation of genocide usually is.

""Little Big Man"" starts you off  in 1970, with a reporter interviewing Mr. Crabb (Dustin Hoffman, in one of his great performances), the sole white survivor of the Battle of Little Big Horn, a wrinkled visage who is 121 years old at the time of the interview. In the course of his tall tale about the taming of the west, he recounts his career as a Cheyenne Indian, a bible thumper, a snake-oil salesman, a gunfighter, a drunk, and just about everything else one could be in those days. Since he was a white man raised by the Cheyenne, and spoke both languages fluently, he moved back and forth between the two worlds.His story is great when it is being funny. I laughed at the sight of Dustin Hoffman dressed as a gunfighter. He really was the fastest gun in the West, and also the surest shot. Only one little thing kept him from achieving gunfighter immortality. He didn't like shooting at any living things.Thankfully this was produced before the forces of political correctness could bowdlerize it. Today this would be watered down to avoid the epithets and stereotypes that add color and authenticity to this wonderful film. It is a obvious precursor to `Dances With Wolves', but also to a movie where the influence is less patent like `Forrest Gump' where famous persons are infused into a historical comic-drama. Numerous interesting characters infuse the picture: the epicene (though lustful) sister, the wise, yet pixilated Indian grandfather (played brilliantly by Chief Dan George), the unconscionable General Custer, the libertine Mrs. Pendrake (Faye Dunaway) and of course Dustin Hoffman's own character.A funny and sad study of a wild time in history mixed with modern sentiments.

Directed  by Arthur Penn(the classic &quot;Bonnie&amp;Clyde from 1967) and based on  the novel by  Thomas Berger, it stars Dustin Hoffman as Jack Crabb.The  story is told by Jack as a 121 year man to a writer who is interviewing him  and he narrates throughout the story. In the beginning of the story we see  the aftermath of a battle with white settlers after an Indian attack.Jack  and his sister are captured by the Cheyenne braves.His sister escapes but  he is adopted and raised by the tribe who call themselves &quot;the human  beings&quot;. As Jack grows into a young man he proves himself in battle  and is given the name &quot;Little Big Man&quot; by the elder of the tribe  &quot;Old Lodge Skins&quot; (well played by actual Native American ,Chief  Dan George),and what was most impressive was the fact that Chief Dan George  wasn't a professional actor.Jack is given that name because his size is  little but his bravery is big.Old Lodge Skins becomes Jack's adopted  Grandfather and their relationship is at the center of the story.The  movie features a first rate supporting cast including Martin Balsam as  Mr.Merriweather,Faye Dunaway as Mrs.Pendrake, Jeff Corey as Wild Bill  Hickok,Richard Mulligan as General George Armstrong Custer and Aimee Eccles  as Sunshine.The story has many funny moments,sad moments,and intense  moments, something not found in many westerns or many movies for that  matter.Chief Dan George was nominated for an Academy Award for Best  Supporting Actor for his role.A movie with a similar theme came out 20  years later in 1990 called &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot; directed and  starring Kevin Costner which won several Academy Awards.Some found that  film to be as good as &quot;Little Big Man&quot;,some didn't.The tagline on  the movie poster for &quot;Little Big Man&quot; read,&quot;Being the  adventures of Jack Crabb,either the most neglected hero of the American  West or a liar of insane proportions.&quot; Judge for yourself.",5,One of the truly all time greatest epic westerns,968976000,"09 15, 2000",2000,2343,"['quot', 'Little', 'Big', 'Man', 'quot', '1970', 'one', 'truly', 'time', 'great', 'epic', 'westerns.I', 'first', 'saw', 'theatre', 'back', 'early', ""'70"", 'was', 'really', 'impressed.I', 'later', 'added', 'video', 'library', 'back', ""'80"", 'first', 'Beta', 'then', 'later', 'VHS.The', 'movie', 'epic', 'scope', 'when', 'transferred', 'small', 'screen', 'however', 'still', 'powerful', 'Directed', 'Arthur', 'Penn', 'classic', 'quot', 'Bonnie', 'amp', 'Clyde', '1967', 'based', 'novel', 'Thomas', 'Berger', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Jack', 'Crabb.The', 'story', 'told', 'Jack', '121', 'year', 'man', 'writer', 'who', 'interviewing', 'story', 'beginning', 'story', 'see', 'aftermath', 'battle', 'white', 'settlers', 'Indian', 'attack.Jack', 'sister', 'are', 'captured', 'Cheyenne', 'braves.His', 'sister', 'escapes', 'adopted', 'raised', 'tribe', 'who', 'call', 'quot', 'human', 'beings', 'quot', 'Jack', 'young', 'man', 'battle', 'given', 'name', 'quot', 'Little', 'Big', 'Man', 'quot', 'elder', 'tribe', 'quot', 'Old', 'Lodge', 'Skins', 'quot', 'well', 'played', 'actual', 'Native', 'American', 'Chief', 'Dan', 'George', 'what', 'was', 'most', 'impressive', 'was', 'fact', 'Chief', 'Dan', 'George', 'was', ""n't"", 'professional', 'actor.Jack', 'given', 'name', 'size', 'little', 'bravery', 'big.Old', 'Lodge', 'Skins', 'Jack', 'adopted', 'Grandfather', 'relationship', 'center', 'story.The', 'movie', 'first', 'rate', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Martin', 'Balsam', 'Mr.Merriweather', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'Mrs.Pendrake', 'Jeff', 'Corey', 'Wild', 'Bill', 'Hickok', 'Richard', 'Mulligan', 'General', 'George', 'Armstrong', 'Custer', 'Aimee', 'Eccles', 'Sunshine.The', 'story', 'many', 'funny', 'moments', 'sad', 'moments', 'intense', 'moments', 'something', 'not', 'found', 'many', 'westerns', 'many', 'movies', 'matter.Chief', 'Dan', 'George', 'was', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'role.A', 'movie', 'similar', 'theme', 'came', 'out', '20', 'years', 'later', '1990', 'called', 'quot', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'quot', 'directed', 'starring', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'won', 'several', 'Academy', 'Awards.Some', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'quot', 'Little', 'Big', 'Man', 'quot', ""didn't.The"", 'tagline', 'movie', 'poster', 'quot', 'Little', 'Big', 'Man', 'quot', 'read', 'quot', 'Being', 'adventures', 'Jack', 'Crabb', 'either', 'most', 'neglected', 'hero', 'American', 'West', 'liar', 'insane', 'proportions.', 'quot', 'Judge']",N/A

Now im not a big fan of forrest gump but i couldn't help but notice the similarities and thought the analogy would be helpful. Now before anybody says anything im very well aware little big man came out at least twenty some years before hand. Now onto the movie its funny,sad,beautiful and touching all emotions are experienced in its running time. Dustin hoffman does a great job but the star of the show to me is chief dan george the scenes between him and dustin hoffman are my favorite and the fact there wasn't more screentime between the two is my biggest complaint about the movie. And i must mention the performance of the person who plays custer its great and probally close to what the real person was like arrogant,egotistical and cowardly. Mention must also go to the scene where they attack the indian village next to the river which spares no bloodshed of horror of the attack. The only thing that my brother could say when the scene was over was disgusting and to think the actual conduct of the soldiers was much worse than shown on the movie says it all.

229720,A34D06JL7LC6MU,6300251012,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[6, 6]","Dustin Hoffman gives one of his best performances (although, almost all of his performances are wonderful) in Little Big Man, a kind of western/comedy/road movie. You know those movies where you follow a character around from misadventure to misadventure while they meet a large share of quirky characters. Recent examples of those kind of films would be Jesus' Son and Breakfast on Pluto; Little Big Man is also one of those kinds of movies. When the film opens we meet 121-year old Jack Crabb (Dustin Hoffman), who looks like Grandpa from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre films. Jack is about to give an interview to a guy who wants to know about indians; Through flash-backs and voice-over Jack tells his story. As a boy, Jack and his family are ambushed by a group of indians but saved by another group (the Cheyenne). With only his sister and him, they go off to live with the indians but his sister escapes quickly leaving Jack all alone. As Jack proves his merit to the indians, he earns the nickname Little Big Man. After a battle where he is almost killed by a white man, he is brought into town and sent to live with two-overly religious people Mr. and Mrs. Pendrake. While Mr. Pendrake is an old religous man, Mrs. Pendrake (Faye Dunaway) is quite different. She appears to be a religious fanatic, but there's something else there as well. After catching her with another man, Jack ends up with a traveling ""healer"" named Mr. Meriweather who is prone to losing various body parts. After that debacle, he's reunited with his sister and becomes a gunslinger but after watching Will Bill Hickok (Jeff Corey) gun down a man, he quits that too. This is all in the first hour alone and this movie runs over two hours long. I'm not a big fan of movies involving cowboys and indians and such; But this movie is actually pretty good. It's very entertaining, all the characters are great, the performances are wonderful, the script is solid. Faye Dunaway isn't even in the movie that long, but she's a scene-stealer in this film for sure. This movie, which features Dustin Hoffman aging from 10 years old to 121 years old holds the world record for doing so. It's the longest anyone's lived on film apparently. It's an interesting film, it's funny and it's hard to not to enjoy.GRADE: A",5,Little Big Man,1156032000,"08 20, 2006",2006,2282,"['Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'almost', 'performances', 'are', 'wonderful', 'Little', 'Big', 'Man', 'kind', 'western/comedy/road', 'movie', 'know', 'movies', 'where', 'follow', 'character', 'misadventure', 'misadventure', 'meet', 'large', 'share', 'quirky', 'characters', 'Recent', 'examples', 'kind', 'films', 'would', 'be', 'Jesus', 'Son', 'Breakfast', 'Pluto', 'Little', 'Big', 'Man', 'also', 'one', 'kinds', 'movies', 'When', 'film', 'meet', '121-year', 'old', 'Jack', 'Crabb', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'who', 'Grandpa', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'films', 'Jack', 'give', 'interview', 'guy', 'who', 'know', 'indians', 'flash-backs', 'voice-over', 'Jack', 'story', 'boy', 'Jack', 'family', 'are', 'ambushed', 'group', 'indians', 'saved', 'group', 'Cheyenne', 'only', 'sister', 'go', 'off', 'live', 'indians', 'sister', 'escapes', 'quickly', 'leaving', 'Jack', 'alone', 'Jack', 'merit', 'indians', 'nickname', 'Little', 'Big', 'Man', 'battle', 'where', 'almost', 'killed', 'white', 'man', 'brought', 'town', 'sent', 'live', 'two-overly', 'religious', 'people', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Pendrake', 'Mr.', 'Pendrake', 'old', 'religous', 'man', 'Mrs.', 'Pendrake', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'quite', 'different', 'be', 'religious', 'fanatic', 'something', 'else', 'there', 'as', 'well', 'catching', 'man', 'Jack', 'up', 'traveling', 'healer', 'named', 'Mr.', 'Meriweather', 'who', 'prone', 'losing', 'various', 'body', 'parts', 'debacle', 'reunited', 'sister', 'gunslinger', 'watching', 'Will', 'Bill', 'Hickok', 'Jeff', 'Corey', 'gun', 'down', 'man', 'too', 'first', 'hour', 'alone', 'movie', 'two', 'hours', 'long', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'movies', 'involving', 'cowboys', 'indians', 'such', 'movie', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'very', 'entertaining', 'characters', 'are', 'great', 'performances', 'are', 'wonderful', 'script', 'solid', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', ""n't"", 'even', 'movie', 'long', 'scene-stealer', 'film', 'sure', 'movie', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'aging', '10', 'years', 'old', '121', 'years', 'old', 'world', 'record', 'doing', 'so', 'longest', 'anyone', 'lived', 'film', 'apparently', 'interesting', 'film', 'funny', 'hard', 'not', 'enjoy.GRADE']",N/A

229728,A1OBJ2263JCK5,6300251012,Kenneth M. Gelwasser,"[47, 51]","I remember seeing the original theatrical release of Arthur Penn's &quot;Little Big Man&quot; in the early 1970's. Now over thirty years later it has been released in DVD form and it is a film, that is both funny and tragic as ever.In the film, 121 year old Jack Crabb (played humorously by Dustin Hoffman) recounts his life (in narrated backflash) growing up among both the Cheyenne Indians and the white man in the old wild West.We follow the Crabb character as he goes through various phases as a Cheyenne warrior, a medicine show conman, a gunfighter, entrepreneurial business man, drunkard and finally a mule skinner/U.S. Army scout. Crabb is a man trapped between two cultures. He hilariously stumbles through the old west trying to find a place among his own kind, even though his heart is still with the Cheyenne Indians who adopted him. The movie leads up to Crabb's eventual, critical participation in the 'Battle of Little Bighorn', otherwise known as 'Custard's Last Stand'.The film is humorus as it shows how little people change over history. Just as today, people of the historical old West were driven by such things as love, lust, vanity, power and money.Unfortunatly they also were driven by bigiotry, hatred and violence.One of the main themes of &quot;Little Big Man&quot; is the terrible, almost genocidal treatment of the American Indian at the hands of the U.S. government.It's somewhat ironic, that the Cheyenne in the film refer to themselves as 'the human beings', yet the white men seem to treat them as anything but that. Arthur Penn (director of &quot;Bonnie &amp; Clyde&quot;) has created a sprawling, well directed, historical tapestry of a film, which makes you want to laugh and cry at the same time.The movie is a star vehicle for the then young, Dustin Hoffman. Like &quot;The Graduate&quot;, this film shows off, what a wonderful comic performer Hoffman can be.The large cast has many standout performances. Faye Dunaway is hilarious as Jack's religious, yet lascivious, adoptive mother, Mrs.Pendrake. The same goes for comic actor, Richard Mulligan, who puts in a very funny performance playing General George Armstong Custard as a pompous egomaniac, who's vanity leads to his imfamous place in history.But by far, one of the best performances in the film comes from Chief Dan George, who play's Hoffman's wise and mystical, yet somewhat scatological adoptive, indian grandfather.The character is intersting, because he always seems to be able tell us the obvious truth of the moment.He understands that this time in history is the begining of the end for his people. I love the speech he makes in which he explains, that &quot;there are endless amounts of white men, but only so many 'human beings'&quot; (indians).Its's a shame Chief George didn't get an Academy Award for his wonderful performance.The DVD for this movie has a good picture and sound transfer, but is absolutly bare bones in extras (not even a trailer). Still, it is great film, which I highly recommend.",4,"My Son , this Movie Makes My Heart Soar Like a Hawk",1053388800,"05 20, 2003",2003,3010,"['remember', 'seeing', 'original', 'theatrical', 'release', 'Arthur', 'Penn', 'quot', 'Little', 'Big', 'Man', 'quot', 'early', '1970', 'Now', 'thirty', 'years', 'later', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'form', 'film', 'funny', 'tragic', 'ever.In', 'film', '121', 'year', 'old', 'Jack', 'Crabb', 'played', 'humorously', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'life', 'narrated', 'backflash', 'growing', 'up', 'Cheyenne', 'Indians', 'white', 'man', 'old', 'wild', 'West.We', 'follow', 'Crabb', 'character', 'various', 'phases', 'Cheyenne', 'warrior', 'medicine', 'show', 'conman', 'gunfighter', 'entrepreneurial', 'business', 'man', 'drunkard', 'finally', 'mule', 'skinner/U.S', 'Army', 'scout', 'Crabb', 'man', 'trapped', 'two', 'cultures', 'hilariously', 'old', 'west', 'trying', 'find', 'place', 'own', 'kind', 'even', 'heart', 'still', 'Cheyenne', 'Indians', 'who', 'adopted', 'movie', 'up', 'Crabb', 'eventual', 'critical', 'participation', ""'Battle"", 'Little', 'Bighorn', 'otherwise', 'known', ""'Custard"", 'Last', ""Stand'.The"", 'film', 'humorus', 'how', 'little', 'people', 'change', 'history', 'Just', 'today', 'people', 'historical', 'old', 'West', 'were', 'driven', 'such', 'things', 'love', 'lust', 'vanity', 'power', 'money.Unfortunatly', 'also', 'were', 'driven', 'bigiotry', 'hatred', 'violence.One', 'main', 'themes', 'quot', 'Little', 'Big', 'Man', 'quot', 'terrible', 'almost', 'genocidal', 'treatment', 'American', 'Indian', 'hands', 'U.S.', 'government.It', 'somewhat', 'ironic', 'Cheyenne', 'film', 'refer', ""'the"", 'human', 'beings', 'white', 'men', 'seem', 'treat', 'anything', 'Arthur', 'Penn', 'director', 'quot', 'Bonnie', 'amp', 'Clyde', 'quot', 'created', 'sprawling', 'well', 'directed', 'historical', 'tapestry', 'film', 'want', 'laugh', 'cry', 'same', 'time.The', 'movie', 'star', 'vehicle', 'then', 'young', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'quot', 'Graduate', 'quot', 'film', 'off', 'what', 'wonderful', 'comic', 'performer', 'Hoffman', 'can', 'be.The', 'large', 'cast', 'many', 'standout', 'performances', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'hilarious', 'Jack', 'religious', 'yet', 'lascivious', 'adoptive', 'mother', 'Mrs.Pendrake', 'same', 'comic', 'actor', 'Richard', 'Mulligan', 'who', 'very', 'funny', 'performance', 'playing', 'General', 'George', 'Armstong', 'Custard', 'pompous', 'egomaniac', 'who', 'vanity', 'imfamous', 'place', 'history.But', 'far', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'film', 'Chief', 'Dan', 'George', 'who', 'play', 'Hoffman', 'wise', 'mystical', 'yet', 'somewhat', 'scatological', 'adoptive', 'indian', 'grandfather.The', 'character', 'intersting', 'always', 'be', 'able', 'tell', 'obvious', 'truth', 'moment.He', 'time', 'history', 'begining', 'end', 'people', 'love', 'speech', 'quot', 'are', 'endless', 'amounts', 'white', 'men', 'only', 'so', 'many', ""'human"", 'beings', 'quot', 'indians', '.Its', 'shame', 'Chief', 'George', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'Academy', 'Award', 'wonderful', 'performance.The', 'DVD', 'movie', 'good', 'picture', 'sound', 'transfer', 'absolutly', 'bare', 'bones', 'extras', 'not', 'even', 'trailer', 'Still', 'great', 'film', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A
229729,A1KT1GWCW8F80,6300251012,K. Gittins,"[16, 17]","Little Big Man is framed as a retrospective narration by Jack Crabb, who at age 120-plus, is the oldest living survivor of Custer's last stand at Little Big Horn, and in the 1960's (?) is being interviewed by a newspaper writer.As kids, Jack and sister Caroline are the only survivors of an Indian attack, and they are taken to an Indian village and meet ""Old Lodge Skins"", the chief. Caroline expects to be raped later (and is somewhat disappointed when she is not) and rides away at night. The Cheyenne (""human beings"") adopt Jack. Due to his small stature, Jack is named ""Little Big Man"" after he saves Younger Bear from a Pawnee attack.In a battle againt the cavalry, just before he is about to be killed, Jack ID's himself as a white man, and is put in the care of Reverend Pendrake, whose wife (Faye Dunaway) takes an interest in Jack. He is taught to to read and write, and takes up religion with Mrs. Pendrake. After he finds Mrs. Pendrake and a soda-shop man in bed, that ends his religion phase.Jack takes up with Mr. Meriwether, a con-man, and ends up getting tarred and feathered by a group led by his own sister. Jack moves in with Caroline and she teaches him to shoot (""Go snake-eyed""). Jack becomes a flashy gun-fighter known as the Soda Pop Kid after his drink of choice. He meets Wild Bill Hickok (""Might I ask who I are addressin'?"") but gives up gunfighting after Hickok kills a man in a bar. Caroline subsequently disowns him, so Jack gets a partner and becomes a store owner, and marries Olga, a large Swedish woman. Jack's partner is a crook, and they goes bankrupt.General Custer is passing by, takes pity on Jack and advises him to ""go west"" with his personal guarantee of safety - cut to Indians raiding a stage coach and riding off with Olga. Jack looks for her unsuccessfully while heading deeper into Cheyenne country, where he is ambushed. He convinces the Indians of his identity, and returns to their camp. He tells Old Lodge Skins about Custer.Jack then rides off, and joins up with Custer to be a scout to find his wife. Custer is snobby and gives him a job as ""mule-skinner"". He rides in a massacre against an Indian village which he tries to stop, then escapes himself. He meets ""Sunshine"" as she is about to give birth in the bushes, and returns to the Indians with her. Old Lodge Skins is now blind from a wound. Jack stays with Sunshine and she hooks him up with her 3 sisters, so he now has 4 wives as Old Lodge Skins once predicted. It turns out his competitive Indian arch-enemy has married Olga.After the birth of a son, the Indians are attacked and Sunshine and the baby are killed. Custer orders Jack hanged, but Jack identifies himself and talks his way out of it. Later at camp, Jack has the opportunity to kill Custer but chickens out. Custer insults him and Jack goes back to the white man as a common drunk. He meets Hickok again and learns Hickok was seeing Mrs. Pendrake, now a widow and prostitute. Hickok gives some money to Jack to give to the widow for a train ticket, then is shot and killed. Mrs. Pendrake flirts with Jack, but Jack just puts Hickok's money on her stomach and leaves.Jack becomes a drunk again, and sees Meriwether (now with a hook and peg-leg) but does not join him in buffalo hunting. He has reached his low-point, and goes into the wilderness to become a hermit. He sees an animal's gnawed off foot in a trap and ""snaps"". He goes to a cliff to commit suicide, but hears the passing cavalry.He decides to ""meet the devil head on"", and joins Custer again. Custer wants to use him as a ""perfect reverse barometer"" to out-fox the Indians. He asks Jack's advice on a proposed attack, which results in Custer's famous last stand at Little Big Horn.Jack rejoins the Indians. Old Lodge Skins gives a moving speech, and goes to the hilltop to die. The narration leads us back to the present as old Jack Crabb winds up his story.Originally R-Rated, the movie was re-rated PG-13, for violence and some sexual situations. The movie runs 138:35 minutes not counting end credits (listed as 139 on DVD, 147 at IMDB). I know they've cut the entire part of sleeping with the three extra wives when shown on TV.Spectacular cinematography including the snow-covered great plains. Nice harmonica/guitar-based score. Excellent acting by all, and direction by Arthur Penn. Richard Mulligan as Custer is one of the best characters on film.

229730,AGKPTMTR3UX1R,6300251012,"Konrei ""Everything I need is right here""","[4, 4]","LITTLE BIG MAN was one of the earliest (1970) and best films to take a revisionist stance regarding the American frontier experience. Dustin Hoffman plays Jack Crabb, the 121-year-old sole survivor of Custer's Last Stand at the Little Big Horn.LITTLE BIG MAN is a spectacular, beautiful film in that it has the viewer laughing uproariously one moment, bitterly weeping the next, and then angry, wistful and despairing in turns. Running the entire emotional range of any human being, LITTLE BIG MAN may well be one of the finest movies ever crafted. A fresh look at the frontier experience when it was produced, LITTLE BIG MAN is attractive for it's innate regard for the natural world and it's consideration of the Native American experience. A film with a strong antiestablishment cant to it (as are many films of the late 1960s and early 1970s), authority, in the form of the United States Military, is unyeilding, unthinking, and given to mindless destruction, a reflection of the Vietnam War era.As the film opens, Crabb, a nursing home resident, is being interviewed by a somewhat pompous young historian. When the historian disparages Crabb the ""Indian fighter""'s supposed attitude toward the Native Americans, Crabb launches into a long reminiscence of his life among the Cheyenne. As it transpires, Crabb, the victim of a Pawnee raid, was rescued by the Cheyenne (""The Human Beings"") as a child. Raised among them, he is given the name of Little Big Man by his Indian grandfather, Old Lodge Skins (Chief Dan George) who becomes the young man's mentor and teaches him the ways of the Human Beings, a spare, straightforward philosophy of respect for the natural world, a worldview in which every Human Being has a place.Captured by Buffalo Soldiers in a pitched battle against his band, Crabb is returned to white society. He soon discovers that the people of his birth live by a highly complex code of hypocrisy. In an episodic but hugely funny set of segments, Crabb is first adopted by the fanatically religious Pendrakes, where he soon becomes the amorous target of his adopted mother (Faye Dunaway in one of her sexiest roles). Running away from Mrs. Pendrake's advances, he takes up with the piratical Allardyce T. Merriweather (Martin Balsam), a snake-oil salesman. When they are tarred and feathered by an  outraged citizenry, Crabb leaves Merriweather's company, soon after becoming a gunfighter (""The Soda Pop Kid""). During his time as a feared gunman, Crabb meets and befriends Wild Bill Hickok (Jeff Corey) and Buffalo Bill. After being present at Hickok's death, Crabb turns in his gun, becomes a storekeeper, and marries Olga, a Swedish immigrant. The two go West at the advice of the megalomaniacal General Custer (Richard Mulligan in one of his best roles).Despite Custer's obvious hatred of the Indians, Crabb, now unsure of himself as a person, finds Custer's hard and fast certainty admirable. Thereafter, the pull of Cheyenne values, as typified by Old Lodge Skins, and American values, as typified by Custer, begin to tear Crabb in two.When Olga is kidnapped by Indians, the angry Crabb does briefly become an Indian fighter, but after witnessing an unprovoked slaughter of his own Cheyenne band, he reverts to his lifestyle as a Human Being. As a Human Being, Crabb is witness to the slow and inexorable defeat of his adopted people. Present at minor battle after minor battle, and then at genocidal disasters like the Washita River, Crabb loses his friends, his Indian wives, his children, and ultimately, his identity. Never able to commit fully to either the American world or the Cheyenne world, Jack Crabb becomes a tragic figure.In the end, his initial respect for Custer becomes loathing. When he is hired on by the Seventh Cavalry as a scout, he tells Custer of the Indians' rage and prophesies a disaster in Custer's future. Custer, who has become near-messianic in his own mind, dismisses Crabb's dark pronouncements and decides to attack the 7,000-strong encampment at Little Big Horn with only a few hundred men. The slaughter that followed is legendary.Rescued from certain death by Cheyenne who recognize him, Crabb returns to Old Lodge Skins and his band, though it is clear that ""the Human Beings will soon walk a road that leads nowhere."" Yet there is Hope. As Old Lodge Skins says, ""Sometimes the magic works, sometimes it doesn't. You wanna eat?"" Life goes on.",5,"""My heart soars like a hawk.""",1156032000,"08 20, 2006",2006,4407,"['LITTLE', 'BIG', 'MAN', 'was', 'one', 'earliest', '1970', 'best', 'films', 'take', 'revisionist', 'stance', 'regarding', 'American', 'frontier', 'experience', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Jack', 'Crabb', '121-year-old', 'sole', 'survivor', 'Custer', 'Last', 'Stand', 'Little', 'Big', 'Horn.LITTLE', 'BIG', 'MAN', 'spectacular', 'beautiful', 'film', 'viewer', 'laughing', 'uproariously', 'one', 'moment', 'bitterly', 'weeping', 'next', 'then', 'angry', 'wistful', 'despairing', 'turns', 'Running', 'entire', 'emotional', 'range', 'human', 'being', 'LITTLE', 'BIG', 'MAN', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'one', 'finest', 'movies', 'ever', 'crafted', 'fresh', 'look', 'frontier', 'experience', 'when', 'was', 'produced', 'LITTLE', 'BIG', 'MAN', 'attractive', 'innate', 'regard', 'natural', 'world', 'consideration', 'Native', 'American', 'experience', 'film', 'strong', 'antiestablishment', 'cant', 'are', 'many', 'films', 'late', '1960s', 'early', '1970s', 'authority', 'form', 'United', 'States', 'Military', 'unyeilding', 'unthinking', 'given', 'mindless', 'destruction', 'reflection', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'era.As', 'film', 'Crabb', 'nursing', 'home', 'resident', 'being', 'interviewed', 'somewhat', 'pompous', 'young', 'historian', 'When', 'historian', 'disparages', 'Crabb', 'Indian', 'fighter', 'supposed', 'attitude', 'Native', 'Americans', 'Crabb', 'long', 'reminiscence', 'life', 'Cheyenne', 'Crabb', 'victim', 'Pawnee', 'raid', 'was', 'rescued', 'Cheyenne', 'Human', 'Beings', 'child', 'Raised', 'given', 'name', 'Little', 'Big', 'Man', 'Indian', 'grandfather', 'Old', 'Lodge', 'Skins', 'Chief', 'Dan', 'George', 'who', 'young', 'man', 'mentor', 'ways', 'Human', 'Beings', 'spare', 'straightforward', 'philosophy', 'respect', 'natural', 'world', 'worldview', 'Human', 'Being', 'place.Captured', 'Buffalo', 'Soldiers', 'pitched', 'battle', 'band', 'Crabb', 'returned', 'white', 'society', 'soon', 'people', 'birth', 'live', 'highly', 'complex', 'code', 'hypocrisy', 'episodic', 'hugely', 'funny', 'set', 'segments', 'Crabb', 'first', 'adopted', 'fanatically', 'religious', 'Pendrakes', 'where', 'soon', 'amorous', 'target', 'adopted', 'mother', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'one', 'sexiest', 'roles', 'Running', 'away', 'Mrs.', 'Pendrake', 'advances', 'up', 'piratical', 'Allardyce', 'T.', 'Merriweather', 'Martin', 'Balsam', 'snake-oil', 'salesman', 'When', 'are', 'tarred', 'feathered', 'outraged', 'citizenry', 'Crabb', 'Merriweather', 'company', 'soon', 'becoming', 'gunfighter', 'Soda', 'Pop', 'Kid', 'time', 'feared', 'gunman', 'Crabb', 'meets', 'Wild', 'Bill', 'Hickok', 'Jeff', 'Corey', 'Buffalo', 'Bill', 'being', 'present', 'Hickok', 'death', 'Crabb', 'gun', 'storekeeper', 'marries', 'Olga', 'Swedish', 'immigrant', 'two', 'go', 'West', 'advice', 'megalomaniacal', 'General', 'Custer', 'Richard', 'Mulligan', 'one', 'best', 'roles', '.Despite', 'Custer', 'obvious', 'hatred', 'Indians', 'Crabb', 'now', 'unsure', 'person', 'Custer', 'hard', 'fast', 'certainty', 'admirable', 'Thereafter', 'pull', 'Cheyenne', 'values', 'typified', 'Old', 'Lodge', 'Skins', 'American', 'values', 'typified', 'Custer', 'begin', 'tear', 'Crabb', 'two.When', 'Olga', 'kidnapped', 'Indians', 'angry', 'Crabb', 'briefly', 'become', 'Indian', 'fighter', 'witnessing', 'unprovoked', 'slaughter', 'own', 'Cheyenne', 'band', 'lifestyle', 'Human', 'Being', 'Human', 'Being', 'Crabb', 'witness', 'slow', 'inexorable', 'defeat', 'adopted', 'people', 'Present', 'minor', 'battle', 'minor', 'battle', 'then', 'genocidal', 'disasters', 'Washita', 'River', 'Crabb', 'friends', 'Indian', 'wives', 'children', 'ultimately', 'identity', 'Never', 'able', 'commit', 'fully', 'either', 'American', 'world', 'Cheyenne', 'world', 'Jack', 'Crabb', 'tragic', 'figure.In', 'end', 'initial', 'respect', 'Custer', 'loathing', 'When', 'hired', 'Seventh', 'Cavalry', 'scout', 'Custer', 'Indians', 'rage', 'disaster', 'Custer', 'future', 'Custer', 'who', 'become', 'near-messianic', 'own', 'mind', 'Crabb', 'dark', 'pronouncements', 'decides', 'attack', '7,000-strong', 'encampment', 'Little', 'Big', 'Horn', 'only', 'few', 'hundred', 'men', 'slaughter', 'followed', 'legendary.Rescued', 'certain', 'death', 'Cheyenne', 'who', 'recognize', 'Crabb', 'Old', 'Lodge', 'Skins', 'band', 'clear', 'Human', 'Beings', 'will', 'soon', 'walk', 'road', 'nowhere', 'Hope', 'Old', 'Lodge', 'Skins', 'Sometimes', 'magic', ""n't"", 'wan', 'eat', 'Life']",N/A

Dustin Hoffman is just superb as Jack Crabb, who as a boy is adopted by the Cheyenne after his family was butchered by the Pawnee.  He grows up to become a full-fledged Cheyenne brave, but when is adoptive father, played by the great Chief Dan George, decides to wage war against the Whites, Crabb suddenly finds himself swept along in the events of the day.  He becomes--in rapid succession--a school boy, con man, gunfighter, store propriertor & husband, Cavalry soldier, drunk, and a scout for General Custer.  This movie abounds with humour, but ultimately I guess this was done in order to make the true message of the movie easier to take.

It's always a little reassuring when they film a movie about Indians and include Indians in its making. You would hope that the native Americans would have incentive to support a correct storyline.This epic movie is based on an epic novel, and as usual when you try to convert a novel, you have to do things differently in the movie version to catch the audience's attention. This isn't bad or good, it's just a different medium with different needs. A painting of a waterfall will be different than a written description of it.  It would have taken a mini-series to allow the novel to play out fully.The story consists of a long recollection of Jack, almost 120, and his years of moving between the white and Indian worlds. As this is a review with narration, you get some foreshadowing, some exaggeration, and touches of humor. The movie is billed as a comedy, and everyone (including the narrator) is flawed. This isn't glossed over or hidden; it's just laid out as the way things are. Here's the story, in all of its convoluted twistedness.When Jack is ten, his family is crossing the plains in a wagon. They are attacked and slain by the Pawnee. Only he and his sister survive. Luckily, a Cheyenne brave comes along and takes pity on them, bringing both back to his village. As with many Indian tribes, the Cheyenne name in their language means ""human beings"". Jack's sister, a young teen, is convinced she's going to be raped - but nobody tries. She takes off, abandoning her little brother. He doesn't mind - he's adopted and treated very well. You see throughout the story that this kid does what he has to in order to stay alive, to fit into what is going on. Jack gets his name Little Big Man when he slays an attacking Pawnee. He's still only about 11.Soon the Cheyenne are enraged by the US Army's wanton slaying of innocents and war against them - but it doesn't work out well. The Cheyenne try hitting the Army with sticks - ""taking coup"" to get victory without killing them - but the army of course is shooting to kill. Jack, to save himself, shows the soldiers he's white - and we start with his life as a white man.Jack is taken in by a pair of ""cultured Christians"" and the wife immediately begins going after him. Disillusioned, he joins up with a snake oil salesman, who Jack feels is ""more honest"". After a tarring and feathering, Jack's found by his sister who trains him in the ways of snake-eyed shooting. Soon he's the Soda Pop Kid, talking with Wild Bill. Jack realizes killing people isn't for him - and when he gets rid of his guns, his sister deserts him (again). So he settles down in a store with a Swedish wife - but they're taken in by swindlers and soon are destitute and heading west. He meets Custer just before they go, and are attacked by ""wild Indians"" on the coach ride. His wife is stolen, and Jack spends three years trying to find her, tracking across many states. He runs into his old tribe along the way.So back to Indian culture. You might think after all whites being shown as slimy cheats, that a movie tends to either be ""pro Indian"" or ""anti Indian"". This one straddles the fence. The Indians don't want to take Jack back in at first. You get glimpses of one Indian who walks, talks and does everything backwards ... while another, Little Horse, is very effeminate, in essence a transvestite. While the Cheyenne are monogamous, Jack's father has a dream where Jack has four wives. They're deliberately not showing a 'quiet happy Indian tribe' - they're making a strong attempt to show ""unusual"" Indians here!Jack joins the Custer forces to try to continue his search for his wife - but the troop ends up slaying innocent Indian women and children and Jack rebels against them. As the elder Jack comments in his narration, ""The world was too ridiculous to bother to live in it"". But then redemption comes - Jack finds a Cheyenne young woman giving birth and takes the pair in as his own. His grandfather convinces the family to stay with the Cheyenne. Jack's wife, Sunshine, starts to lay a guilt trip on Jack on how her sisters are lonely and have no husbands and she wants to bring them ""into the family"". About the same time, Jack realizes that his first wife, Olga, now is living with the Cheyenne, so he stops worrying about her. To add to his sexual woes, Jack is propositioned by Little Horse.As his wife trudges off, alone, in the snow to have her baby solo (the ""Indian way""), Jack gives in to temptation and goes into his teepee with the three sisters. This is one of the scenes that bugged me. I'm OK with the idea that Jack regularly switches sides to get out of trouble and easily falls into drunkenness / taking advantage of people / etc. He's not perfect, none of us are. But for him to sleep with three other women while his wife is in labor because it's ""the Indian way"" is a bit much. Especially when the Cheyenne way is monogamy, and the Indian way is to care about those you're joined with.Just as Jack is getting used to this decadent way of life, in comes the army. On an Indian reservation, where the Indians should be protected, the army shoots and slaughters everyone - women, children, ponies. But when Jack has the opportunity shortly afterwards to kill Custer, Jack doesn't have the courage. Custer realizes this and puts him down as not a worthy Cheyenne - and not worth hanging either. Jack collapses into despair.Wild Bill runs into the drunken Jack and tries to clean him up. In short order, Jack runs into just about every other character he'd known, gets ready to commit suicide, and sees the army. He decides his quest is to kill Custer. Custer recognizes him as the renegade and decides to hire him as a scout - and to do the exact opposite of anything Jack tells him to do. Apparently Custer wanted just ""one more victory"" and felt he'd then get elected president. In a Forrest Gump moment (just like the entire movie, pretty much), Jack tells Custer to go get himself killed at Little Big Horn, that it's doom for him. Custer chooses to believe Jack is lying, and we know the rest.The movie ends on a somber note - Jack's grandfather prepares to die, and in essence states that the entire Cheyenne nation is doomed to destruction. For a ""comedy"", it's got some pretty serious messages in it, tucked in between the corners. The key is to realize that this is the glossy, Hollywood version of the story. You're getting the storyline, and a few glimpses into the cultures involved. They're putting up caricatures in many cases, because the past-100 man telling the story is ... telling a story. Hopefully this will tweak the interest of many viewers, so that they get the more in depth view the book offers, or they go on to learn more about the real Native American cultures which offer so much.",5,A Great Introduction to the Old West,1169078400,"01 18, 2007",2007,6904,"['Little', 'Big', 'Man', 'was', 'filmed', 'Montana', 'California', 'Alberta', 'Canada', 'help', 'Crow', 'Cheyenne',

229736,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,6300251012,magellan,"[4, 4]","I saw this film again after a hiatus of 25 years recently, and it held up very well. No doubt the fans of the Berger book hated it, but as a movie it comes off very well. It stands as one of the great absurdist movies in the contrasts it draws between the white man and the Indians. And the Indians aren't all good--the Paiutes are portrayed as bad Indians--as bad as the whites. But the strength of the movie is in its hilarious and often tragic comparisons between the two cultures, and we see the absurdity and complexity of the white man's ways thrown into relief by comparison with the simplicity of the Indian ways. The dialog is sometimes totally demented and resembles nothing so much as the European theater of the absurd transplanted to the American west. In one of the greatest ironic/satirical movie roles of all time, Chief Dan George delivers many of these show-stopping lines, such as when he comments on one of his wives (I think I have it more or less correct, but cut me some slack): ""Snake woman cooks dog well, and has very soft skin. But the problem with snake women is that they copulate with horses. She denies it, of course, but she is lying. This is why I call her, ""woman who does not like horses""."" LOL. Some day I'm going to have to read the book just to see if it was toned down for the movie.The all-star cast all turn in great performances and Hoffman turns in possibly the best performance of his career, and certainly the most wide ranging one in going from a teenager to a 120-year old man during the course of the movie. The other stars were also great and there's not a false note among them. Martin Balsam doesn't always get as much credit as he should having spent his entire career in character-actor roles, but here he is superb as the eternally optimistic snake oil salesman who is continually losing body parts, eventually becoming peg-legged, one-handed, and one-eyed. Faye Dunaway plays a seductive and naughty preacher's wife and she's the perfect choice for this role. Also notable were Jeff Corey as Wild Bill Hickok and Richard Mulligan as the ambitious but narcissistic General Custer. By the way, just a little trivia here, Custer graduated at the bottom of his West Point class, but still made general at a very young age. One thing you could say about the Old West was that there were certainly opportunities for quick advancement that don't exist today. :-)Overall a great movie that has stood the test of time.",5,Classic tragic comedy,1267660800,"03 4, 2010",2010,2464,"['saw', 'film', 'again', 'hiatus', '25', 'years', 'recently', 'held', 'up', 'very', 'well', 'No', 'doubt', 'fans', 'Berger', 'book', 'hated', 'movie', 'off', 'very', 'well', 'one', 'great', 'absurdist', 'movies', 'contrasts', 'white', 'man', 'Indians', 'Indians', 'are', ""n't"", 'all', 'good', 'Paiutes', 'are', 'portrayed', 'bad', 'Indians', 'as', 'bad', 'whites', 'strength', 'movie', 'hilarious', 'often', 'tragic', 'comparisons', 'two', 'cultures', 'see', 'absurdity', 'complexity', 'white', 'man', 'ways', 'thrown', 'relief', 'comparison', 'simplicity', 'Indian', 'ways', 'dialog', 'sometimes', 'totally', 'demented', 'nothing', 'so', 'much', 'European', 'theater', 'absurd', 'transplanted', 'American', 'west', 'one', 'greatest', 'ironic/satirical', 'movie', 'roles', 'time', 'Chief', 'Dan', 'George', 'many', 'show-stopping', 'lines', 'such', 'when', 'comments', 'one', 'wives', 'think', 'have', 'more', 'less', 'correct', 'cut', 'slack', 'Snake', 'woman', 'dog', 'well', 'very', 'soft', 'skin', 'problem', 'snake', 'women', 'copulate', 'horses', 'course', 'lying', 'why', 'call', 'woman', 'who', 'not', 'like', 'horses', 'LOL', 'day', ""'m"", 'going', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'just', 'see', 'was', 'toned', 'down', 'movie.The', 'all-star', 'cast', 'turn', 'great', 'performances', 'Hoffman', 'possibly', 'best', 'performance', 'career', 'certainly', 'most', 'wide', 'ranging', 'one', 'going', 'teenager', '120-year', 'old', 'man', 'course', 'movie', 'other', 'stars', 'were', 'also', 'great', 'not', 'false', 'note', 'Martin', 'Balsam', ""n't"", 'always', 'get', 'much', 'credit', 'should', 'having', 'spent', 'entire', 'career', 'character-actor', 'roles', 'here', 'superb', 'eternally', 'optimistic', 'snake', 'oil', 'salesman', 'who', 'continually', 'losing', 'body', 'parts', 'eventually', 'becoming', 'peg-legged', 'one-handed', 'one-eyed', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'seductive', 'naughty', 'preacher', 'wife', 'perfect', 'choice', 'role', 'Also', 'notable', 'were', 'Jeff', 'Corey', 'Wild', 'Bill', 'Hickok', 'Richard', 'Mulligan', 'ambitious', 'narcissistic', 'General', 'Custer', 'way', 'just', 'little', 'trivia', 'here', 'Custer', 'graduated', 'bottom', 'West', 'Point', 'class', 'still', 'made', 'general', 'very', 'young', 'age', 'One', 'thing', 'could', 'say', 'Old', 'West', 'was', 'were', 'certainly', 'opportunities', 'quick', 'advancement', 'do', ""n't"", 'exist', 'today', 'Overall', 'great', 'movie', 'stood', 'test', 'time']",N/A

Morgan,"[0, 0]","This film came out during the peak of ""American New Wave Movies"" during their heyday of 1967-1975, such as ""Bonnie and Clyde"", ""Midnight Cowboy"", ""Cinderella Liberty"" , ""The Last Detail"" and ""Cinderella Liberty"".  Arthur Penn's earlier work: ""Bonnie and Clyde"", was not merely a tale of two bank robbers- it showed the anti authoritarian zeitgeist of the 1960's. Penn was a master of this genre, as were his contemporaries John Schlesinger and Robert Towne.  Native Americans were systematically cheated, decimated by disease and murdered by land grabbing (mostly White) settlers in America.  Native Americans had their cutlure and language stolen from them in the early part of the 20th century through the residential schooling of Native American chikldren. Native Americans were not considered by the US Government to be US citizens until 1924.  During much of the 20th century, Hollywood and TV more often than not showed Native Americans to be violnt savages.In this movie, as another reviewer has mentioned, oftentimes the Native Americans are shown to be ""geniuses and humanitarians"" while the White settlers are shown to be savages.Based on my reading of history I am cdertain that the truth was much more complex and nuanced. My guess is that there were indeed Whites that sought to deal with the Indians in a fair and hionest way of mutual respect, but as his often been the sad case- the people who are the greediest, most violent, and or the most connected to powerful people, run roughshod over the majority who believe in fairness. For example, in the early part of our history, the Quakers of Pennsylvania had amicable relations with American Indians.This film invariably shows White Americans to be corrupt, hypocritical,shallow,vain  false and oftentimes murderous brutes. Again I think this is a sort of ""historical"" compensation for the thousands of Hollywood films and TV ""Westerns of the 1950's-60's showing American Indians to be bloodthirsty savages.Dustin Hoffman's versatility and emotional intensity and authenticity are strong throughout the film.  Faye Dunaway is/ was very pretty and sexy- but her acting was in my view 2nd rate. The gal who played Dustin Hoffman's sister-I forget her name- was excellent.

the great plains by a tribe of Pawnee when he was only ten.He relates his incredible story throughout the movie in the form of narration to a disbelieving reporter, especially doubtful over Crabb's claim to being the sole white survivor of the Battle of Little Big Horn, in Crabb's own words, ""popularly knowed as Custer's Last Stand.""He and his sister are taken in by a tribe of Cheyenne (who call themselves the ""Human Beings""), where he spends his early years, until one of the many twists and turns of his life put him back in the company of whites, this time by a firey preacher and his less than virtuous wife, played by Faye Dunaway.I don't want to give away too much of the story by detailing more of odd turns his life subsequently takes, but he does go back and forth between the worlds of the whites and the Cheyenne.The other notable actors in this movie are Martin Balsam, Chief Dan George, Jeff Corey, and Richard Mulligan (what a performance!), who plays Custer.Crabb has multiple close brushes with death, and there are lots of funny situations, including one where he meets none other than William Butler ""Wild Bill"" Hickok, played beautifully by Jeff Corey.However, while very funny, there are some moments of sickening brutality, as the Cheyenne are steadily squeezed out by the likes of the ambitious Custer.This is a complex story that effectively uses the juxtaposition of humor with tragedy to give life to both.Hoffman's performance is simply astonishing, going from a very young teen, to a young man, to middle aged, to drunk, to hermit, to very old man.Hoffman's old man makeup is remarkable, and Hoffman himself screamed for an extended period before filming the parts with him in the makeup to give his voice that raspy and harsh old man's quality.This is one of those movies I always just come back to watch each year or so, as it is just so good.It is based on the excellent Thomas Berger novel, which I have also read, and there are a few key differences, notably the relationship between Crabb and Hickok, and what happens to Hoffman's ""grandfather"" Cheyenne chief Old Lodgeskins.Hoffman's skill as an actor is in little doubt, but his performance here is quite possibly his greatest in a long line (""Kramer vs. Kramer,"" ""Rainman,"" ""Tootsie,"" ""Midnight Cowboy"") of great performances.If you enjoy complexity in a story and a

As the pompous scholar begins to explain to his elderly interviewee about the `real' American West, the man becomes indignant and begins telling a fascinating tale. It is a very human story that he shares and unlike the professor's close-minded, simplistic view of the conflict between the American Indians and white men (a popular modern viewpoint that anything Indian was numinous and good and anything white was evil), it is a revealing of the fact that there was good and bad on both sides.Thankfully this was produced before the forces of political correctness could bowdlerize it. Today this would be watered down to avoid the epithets and stereotypes that add color and authenticity to this wonderful film. It is a obvious precursor to `Dances With Wolves', but also to a movie where the influence is less patent like `Forrest Gump' where famous persons are infused into a historical comic-drama. Numerous interesting characters infuse the picture: the epicene (though lustful) sister, the wise, yet pixilated Indian grandfather (played brilliantly by Chief Dan George), the unconscionable General Custer, the libertine Mrs. Pendrake (Faye Dunaway may possibly be the sexiest woman to ever appear on screen) and of course Dustin Hoffman's own character.A funny and sad study of a wild time in history mixed with modern sentiments.

His range here is incredible as he portrays a man torn between two cultures and his life weaves back and forth between the white world and the indian world in which he was raised. His performance is funny when appropriate and yet filled with pathos and emotion when the necessary. An absolute masterful job of acting.The Cheyenne scenes are moving and Ghief Dan george who plays Crabb's adoptive grandfather provides the film with gravity as he consistently demnonstrates wisdom and dignity despite the increasingly difficult circumstances that his tribe finds themselves in.I don't know the actor's name who plays Custer but he provides just the right amount of comic bravado to make Custer seem to be a pathetic character who's hubris led to his troops demise. While this may or may not be an historically acurate portrayal it certainly fits the mood of the film.Other famous western personalities such as Wild Bill Hickock are included in the story as Jack Crabb's life zig-zags it's way through the west.

This adaptation of the Thomas Berger novel, stands on its own quite well. Not as raw as the novel, but every bit as satisfying. Dustin Hoffman's portrayal of the 121 year old Jack Crabb, stands out as one of his, and filmdom's great screen performances. Even if one doesn't care much for Westerns, this film is more than just a Western; its an American epic. One of Hollywood's better portrayals of a more sympathetic and human side to the Native-American plight.From the tragic loss of most of his family at the hands of renegade Indians, to his being raised into his adolescent years by the Cheyenne, this story is both compelling, and at times extremely funny. Raised during his teen years with the strictly religious Pendrakes, Jack enters a new phase of life, and an end-to-innocence, after discovering the infidelity of Mrs. Pendrake(Faye Dunnaway), who never looked lovelier on the big screen. Experiencing life as a Medicine Man, Gunslinger, General Store owner, and taking on his first wife Olga, who he loses to the Indians, after taking the advice of General George Armstrong Custer(Richard Mulligan in his finest role)to ""go west.""Returning to his Cheyenne family, he takes his second wife Sunshine. Watching this film in the theater after its initial release, it was love-at-first-sight seeing the actress playing this young woman. It was also one of the most gut-wrenching moments in film history, to watch the brutal murder of Sunshine, and the newborn baby of Jack Crabb, gunned-down by the U.S. Calvary as she flees with baby-in-arm, during the cruel massacre of the Indian Nation. The entire audience was in total shocked silence. But he does manage to rescue his Grandfather, Old Lodge Skins, played by the Oscar nominated Chief Dan George. He then turns Hermit and nearly goes mad. He even manages the impossible, of being the ""sole white survivor of the Little Bighorn.""

229759,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,6300251012,Robert J. Crawford,"[2, 2]","Ever since I saw it when it came out, this has been one of my all-time favorite films.  I recently got to re-watch it with a family member who had never seen it before, which re-opened my eyes to this masterpiece.  It can be watched throughout one's life with great profit.It is hard for people to imagine when this came out, in 1970 or so.  At that time, Spaghetti Westerns were the norm, with tough heroes, 2-dimensional bad guys, unfailingly savage Indians, unambiguously just causes (of pioneer-colonizers), and very very little humor.  This film violated many of the norms of the genre.  As Jack Crabb went through his innumerable identities, it was both hilariously funny and extremely sad, an exploration of our notions of the wild west and a cry for understanding.Crabb starts as an adopted Cheyenne indian, introducing the viewer to a wonderful culture and, as the film progresses, to a deep philosophy that is radically different from the white American.  In particular, he has a wonderful relationship with the humourful though deeply concerned chief Lodge Skins.  This man was a revelation to me, a highly intelligent leader who was also a mystic seer, full of a unique brand of ancient wisdom.  Now you can argue that he is typical of 60s new agey romanticism, but he is far too subtle to be pegged.  Indeed, through Crabb's Cheyenne friends and later his wife, Sunshine, I got a sense - for the first time in my life - of what we lost in colonizing the west and wiping out the ancient cultures there.  I began to ask myself questions that have preoccupied me to this day.  I hope my children will do the same.  Indeed, I had not ever conceived of the idea that the indian tribes could have different cultures and customs in 1970. To be perfectly frank, I had not even considered the possibility that Indians could have individual personalities - a direct consequence of the way they were then portrayed in TV and film.In his white-man incarnations, Crabb explores the full gamut of identities available to him:  religious zealot, flimflam man, gunslinger, dry goods dealer, and indian scout.  While in many ways satiric, the portraits in my opinion are also extremely well drawn, getting the viewer to question the stereotypes with which we grew up of our civilization's path and our sense of moral righteousness.  It is a monument to the vision of Penn.  Even our heros, like the Custer whom I had idolized in the Errol Flynn film or Wild BIll Hickok, are thrown in relief against the incredible dignity, playfulness, of depth of the Cheyenne.Underneath it all is a humanistic philosophy that gets the viewer (or at least everyone I have ever discussed it with) to question their behavior and world view.  While unfailingly funny, the core of the film is horrifically tragic.Recommended with the greatest enthusiasm.",5,tragicomic take on the demise of the Indians and their culture,1289260800,"11 9, 2010",2010,2831,"['Ever', 'saw', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'been', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'films', 'recently', 'got', 're-watch', 'family', 'member', 'who', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 're-opened', 'eyes', 'masterpiece', 'can', 'be', 'watched', 'one', 'life', 'great', 'profit.It', 'hard', 'people', 'imagine', 'when', 'came', 'out', '1970', 'so', 'time', 'Spaghetti', 'Westerns', 'were', 'norm', 'tough', 'heroes', '2-dimensional', 'bad', 'guys', 'unfailingly', 'savage', 'Indians', 'unambiguously', 'just', 'causes', 'pioneer-colonizers', 'very', 'very', 'little', 'humor', 'film', 'violated', 'many', 'norms', 'genre', 'Jack', 'Crabb', 'went', 'innumerable', 'identities', 'was', 'hilariously', 'funny', 'extremely', 'sad', 'exploration', 'notions', 'wild', 'west', 'cry', 'understanding.Crabb', 'starts', 'adopted', 'Cheyenne', 'indian', 'introducing', 'viewer', 'wonderful', 'culture', 'film', 'deep', 'philosophy', 'radically', 'different', 'white', 'American', 'particular', 'wonderful', 'relationship', 'humourful', 'deeply', 'concerned', 'chief', 'Lodge', 'Skins', 'man', 'was', 'revelation', 'highly', 'intelligent', 'leader', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'mystic', 'seer', 'full', 'unique', 'brand', 'ancient', 'wisdom', 'Now', 'can', 'argue', 'typical', '60s', 'new', 'agey', 'romanticism', 'far', 'too', 'subtle', 'be', 'pegged', 'Indeed', 'Crabb', 'Cheyenne', 'friends', 'later', 'wife', 'Sunshine', 'got', 'sense', 'first', 'time', 'life', 'what', 'lost', 'colonizing', 'west', 'wiping', 'out', 'ancient', 'there', 'began', 'ask', 'questions', 'have', 'preoccupied', 'day', 'hope', 'children', 'will', 'do', 'same', 'Indeed', 'had', 'not', 'ever', 'conceived', 'idea', 'indian', 'tribes', 'could', 'have', 'different', 'cultures', 'customs', '1970', 'be', 'perfectly', 'frank', 'had', 'not', 'even', 'considered', 'possibility', 'Indians', 'could', 'have', 'individual', 'personalities', 'direct', 'consequence', 'way', 'were', 'then', 'portrayed', 'TV', 'film.In', 'white-man', 'incarnations', 'Crabb', 'full', 'gamut', 'identities', 'available', 'religious', 'zealot', 'flimflam', 'man', 'gunslinger', 'dry', 'goods', 'dealer', 'indian', 'scout', 'many', 'ways', 'satiric', 'portraits', 'opinion', 'are', 'also', 'extremely', 'well', 'drawn', 'getting', 'viewer', 'question', 'stereotypes', 'grew', 'up', 'civilization', 'path', 'sense', 'moral', 'righteousness', 'monument', 'vision', 'Penn', 'Even', 'heros', 'Custer', 'whom', 'had', 'idolized', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'film', 'Wild', 'BIll', 'Hickok', 'are', 'thrown', 'relief', 'incredible', 'dignity', 'playfulness', 'depth', 'Cheyenne.Underneath', 'humanistic', 'philosophy', 'viewer', 'least', 'everyone', 'have', 'ever', 'discussed', 'question', 'behavior', 'world', 'view', 'unfailingly', 'funny', 'core', 'film', 'horrifically', 'tragic.Recommended', 'greatest', 'enthusiasm']",N/A

It portrays the whites and indians in radically different ways, neither of which is probably very accurate.  At times one gets the impression of slapstick comedy almost.  There is a distinct sardonic and ironic outlook throughout this film, which works sometimes better than others.  I do give it credit for being rather unique in its presentation.  The coincidences of the main character being involved in all these events seems fantastic.  Still, this method serves as a means to provide a pastiche of the American West incorporating all the popular icons of the period that have come down to us over the years.The movie tries to show that both white and red man were crazy in their own ways.  The Indians come off looking more harmless in their eccentricities as compared to the whites, and one gets the impression this is the main the message this long epoch is trying to convey.  The scenes with Custer are amusing, and certainly exaggerated even for him!  I think if one takes into account that this was one man's view of history we can begin to see the film in a more realistic light.  Deffinitely a film of its time, one often gets the feeling that Dustin Hoffman is replaying ""The Graduate"" with Faye Dunaway on a different level.

Johnson,"[9, 10]","in history or a Liar of Insane Proportions!&quot;This is Dustin Hoffman's tour de force; his transformation from a young man into a very, very old one, and it is entirely believable and great to watch. All the cast members are terrific, and Jeff Corey and Robert Mulligan my favorites. When Hoffman joins Custer's 7th as a scout/mule skinner he deliberately gives Custer the information that causes him to make the ill-fated decision to ride into the waiting arms of several thousand Sioux/Cheyenne and consequently, history. His own scout,the Native American named White Man Runs Him, warned him on the day before the Battle: &quot;Tomorrow we go home by a different path.&quot;Interesting note:&quot;One of the facts surrounding the battle that has been largely overlooked is that it wasn't just Bluecoats against Indians. It was Indians against Indians. Without the Crow and Arikara scouts aiding the military, the Bluecoats would not even have been able to find the Sioux and Cheyenne. On June 17, when Crazy Horse and his warriors attacked General Crook's detachment at the Battle of the Rosebud, the battle favored the Sioux, although Crook called it a draw. He withdrew from the field to lick his wounds, taking himself out of the hunt for the ''hostiles,'' and neither Gibbon and his men, Terry and his men, nor Custer and his men knew that he had returned to base. But this is the real kicker about that battle: the Crow and Arikera scouts saved General Crook and his men from an even more absolute whipping.This, and other poignant details, are explored in a new book, ''Little Bighorn Remembered,'' by Herman J. Viola. He is the Curator Emeritus of the Smithsonian Institution and noted author of fifteen books on American Indians over the past quarter century. He is now the adopted brother of Joseph Medicine Crow, whose grandfather White Man Runs Him was a scout for Custer, helping him to find the large gathering of Sioux and Cheyenne at the Little Big Horn.&quot;The most haunting part of the entire movie, for me, was the massacre of Native Americans as a result of the Battle of the Little Big Horn. When the 7th rides into the camp they are accompanied by the stirring tune of &quot;Garryowens&quot; and slaughter men, women and children in one astounding, riveting scene, that horrifies and hypnotizes. You know it actually happened, it is historical and that makes it have far more impact, and it is very hard to watch, yet impossible not to.All the Native Americans portrayed are done so with great care and I liked the friend of Hoffman's who later became a &quot;Contrary&quot; and walked backwards and spoke backwards, and the one who was more female than male and allowed, quite generously and without prejudice of any kind, to remain with the women and children, and to dress like a woman.The elephant spigot in the drugstore was great, (that Old Lodge Skins saw in a dream) as was Faye Dunaway's portrayal of the good Christian wife with a side of lust.When Custer loses it on the Battlefield, it is something to see, and he literally goes insane in front of us. In accounts of the actual battle, there were reports of soldiers going insane and killing themselves first before the Sioux could get to them; not a bad idea, considering the way in which they were butchered. Another interesting factoid was that the battle itself took about twenty minutes, and was not the long, drawn out episode sometimes portrayed. An old Sioux watched from afar, and said the battle lasted as long as it took him to finish his pipe. There were mutilations too, and Custer was the only one relatively untouched; when the squaws came to the battlefield they pierced his ears so in the next life he would &quot;hear better, for he had been warned not to attack the Sioux again.&quot;All in all, a wonderful movie and really transports you to a another time, long gone.",5,&quot;Little Big Man was either the Most Neglected Hero,1052956800,"05 15, 2003",2003,3878,"['history', 'Liar', 'Insane', 'Proportions', 'quot', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'transformation', 'young', 'man', 'very', 'very', 'old', 'one', 'entirely', 'believable', 'great', 'watch', 'cast', 'members', 'are', 'terrific', 'Jeff', 'Corey', 'Robert', 'Mulligan', 'favorites', 'When', 'Hoffman', 'Custer', '7th', 'scout/mule', 'skinner', 'deliberately', 'Custer', 'information', 'make', 'ill-fated', 'decision', 'ride', 'waiting', 'arms', 'several', 'thousand', 'Sioux/Cheyenne', 'consequently', 'history', 'own', 'scout', 'Native', 'American', 'named', 'White', 'Man', 'Runs', 'Him', 'warned', 'day', 'Battle', 'quot', 'Tomorrow', 'go', 'home', 'different', 'path.', 'quot', 'Interesting', 'note', 'quot', 'One', 'facts', 'surrounding', 'battle', 'been', 'largely', 'overlooked', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'Bluecoats', 'Indians', 'was', 'Indians', 'Indians', 'Crow', 'Arikara', 'aiding', 'military', 'Bluecoats', 'would', 'not', 'even', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'find', 'Sioux', 'Cheyenne', 'June', '17', 'when', 'Crazy', 'Horse', 'warriors', 'attacked', 'General', 'Crook', 'detachment', 'Battle', 'Rosebud', 'battle', 'favored', 'Sioux', 'Crook', 'called', 'draw', 'withdrew', 'field', 'lick', 'wounds', 'taking', 'hunt', 'hostiles', 'Gibbon', 'men', 'Terry', 'men', 'Custer', 'men', 'knew', 'had', 'returned', 'base', 'real', 'kicker', 'battle', 'Crow', 'Arikera', 'saved', 'General', 'Crook', 'men', 'even', 'more', 'absolute', 'whipping.This', 'other', 'poignant', 'details', 'are', 'explored', 'new', 'book', 'Little', 'Bighorn', 'Remembered', 'Herman', 'J.', 'Viola', 'Curator', 'Emeritus', 'Smithsonian', 'Institution', 'noted', 'author', 'fifteen', 'books', 'American', 'Indians', 'past', 'quarter', 'century', 'now', 'adopted', 'brother', 'Joseph', 'Medicine', 'Crow', 'grandfather', 'White', 'Man', 'Runs', 'Him', 'was', 'scout', 'Custer', 'helping', 'find', 'large', 'gathering', 'Sioux', 'Cheyenne', 'Little', 'Big', 'Horn.', 'quot', 'most', 'haunting', 'part', 'entire', 'movie', 'was', 'massacre', 'Native', 'Americans', 'result', 'Battle', 'Little', 'Big', 'Horn', 'When', '7th', 'rides', 'camp', 'are', 'accompanied', 'stirring', 'tune', 'quot', 'Garryowens', 'quot', 'slaughter', 'men', 'women', 'children', 'one', 'astounding', 'riveting', 'scene', 'horrifies', 'hypnotizes', 'know', 'actually', 'happened', 'historical', 'have', 'far', 'more', 'impact', 'very', 'hard', 'watch', 'yet', 'impossible', 'not', 'Native', 'Americans', 'portrayed', 'are', 'done', 'so', 'great', 'care', 'liked', 'friend', 'Hoffman', 'who', 'later', 'became', 'quot', 'Contrary', 'quot', 'walked', 'backwards', 'spoke', 'backwards', 'one', 'who', 'was', 'more', 'female', 'male', 'allowed', 'quite', 'generously', 'prejudice', 'kind', 'remain', 'women', 'children', 'dress', 'woman.The', 'elephant', 'spigot', 'drugstore', 'was', 'great', 'Old', 'Lodge', 'Skins', 'saw', 'dream', 'was', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'portrayal', 'good', 'Christian', 'wife', 'side', 'lust.When', 'Custer', 'Battlefield', 'something', 'see', 'literally', 'insane', 'front', 'accounts', 'actual', 'battle', 'were', 'reports', 'soldiers', 'going', 'insane', 'killing', 'first', 'Sioux', 'could', 'get', 'not', 'bad', 'idea', 'considering', 'way', 'were', 'butchered', 'interesting', 'factoid', 'was', 'battle', 'took', 'about', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'was', 'not', 'long', 'drawn', 'out', 'episode', 'sometimes', 'portrayed', 'old', 'Sioux', 'watched', 'afar', 'said', 'battle', 'lasted', 'as', 'long', 'took', 'finish', 'pipe', 'were', 'mutilations', 'too', 'Custer', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'relatively', 'untouched', 'when', 'squaws', 'came', 'battlefield', 'pierced', 'ears', 'so', 'next', 'life', 'would', 'quot', 'hear', 'better', 'had', 'been', 'warned', 'not', 'attack', 'Sioux', 'again.', 'quot', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'really', 'transports', 'time', 'long', 'gone']",N/A

229768,A1FNES0QEBJZD1,6300251012,Steve Douglas,"[1, 2]","I have always enjoyed this film and finally got it on Blu Ray after many years of not seeing it.  The last time I watched it, I had it on VHS.  Plenty of opinions have been proffered on the acting, historical accuracy  and plots so I will not be redundant and give the same old summaries.  Instead, as I always do, I will focus strictly upon the actual quality of the BR.  Keep in mind that the quality of what you see and hear also depends upon the quality of TV monitor you are using and its accompanying home theater processor and speakers. I have a pretty high end, esoteric system and am judging the Blu Ray off of that.VIDEO....A fairly old movie originally shot on film, it still retains its theatrical legs.  The transfer to video displays life like colors in all areas, i.e. skin, environment as it pertains to the grassy plains.  Color resolution is good and does not pop as many of today's films do.  Blacks do not go very deep but contrast is fairly good.  Small details tend to vary depending upon the scene.  Close ups of Dustin Hoffman clearly show distinct skin pores, yet scenes with the prairie or hair on a persons head tend to be slightly soft as film often creates.  The average Mbps rate is in the high teens and low 20's.  There is a slight grain throughout but this is only noticeable when the sky is predominant in the image.  All in all, the transfer is quite good but I clearly do not believe that this was remastered for BR but simply transcoded. Never the less, I saw no artifacting or hairs, scratches or any other issue with the transfer.  A good film but you will probably not see that much of a significant improvement between the Standard Def format and the BR.AUDIO...The audio is a lossless DTS 5.1 which creates a transparent dialogue for the listener.  However, there is a very, very little use of the surrounds in your home theater setup.  Only at the end of the film, during the Custer's Last Stand scene was there any real panning of the audio between the front and rear stages.  The LFE channel gets no use at all since there really wasn't any deep bass recorded.  I do wish they had remastered the soundtrack as there would have been plenty of opportunities in this film for discreet channeling.EXTRAS...There are none other than a trailer.Glad I have this film and will watch it every once in a blue moon but do not expect a high end video or audio experience.I do hope that this review has been of some HELP to you in deciding your purchase.

229772,AQP1VPK16SVWM,6300251012,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[27, 29]","One of director Arthur Penn's finest films, Little Big Man combines satire with tragedy with a deft, sure hand. The screenplay by the talented Calder Willingham and direction are sharp as nails and actor Dustin Hoffman manages to pull off a coup playing Jack Crabb from teen years (it's actually Hoffman's voice you hear dubbed in as a young teen)to old age (with marvelous make up by Dick Smith). Is Crabb telling tall tales (ironic and appropriate given his small stature and his Indian name)or did much of what he speaks about occur? It doesn't really matter as the telling of the tale is so marvelous.BLU-RAY:There is dirt and debris that crop up. There are also occasional scratches. Colors are a bit subdued but the film has always looked that way--this isn't a movie that flashes bright colors on screen. It's a pity that this catalog title didnt fet a bit more love in this transfer but it does improve on the DVD. The aspect ratio here is 2.36:1 vs. the original theatrical aspect ratio of 2.35:1 so it's a tiny bit off but very close to the original.Detail is a huge improvement over the previous DVD and a moderate amount of depth is provided with the high def transfer.The original audio soundtrack is presented in mono and it's a nice, clear presentation.The only extra we get is a theatrical trailer. That's a pity because an interview with Hoffman on the making of the film and/or a documentary with interviews done before the death of director Arthur Penn would have been nice to privde some insight into the production of this deft satire.THE DVD:Penn and his collaborators use Jack as a social mirror reflecting the injustice, brutality and pettiness of the wild west. Staying true to the spirit of Thomas Berger's marvelous novel, the cast and crew manage to distill much of the essence of Berger while sacrificing some of the less important details. The loss is, surprisingly, not really felt for many of those who read the novel. The superb supporting cast includes Martin Balsam, Jeff Corey (in a funny, perceptive cameo as Wild Bill Hiccock), Faye Dunaway (as a religious hypocrite who lusts after her adopted son Jack), Chief Dan George (he has some of the funniest lines in the script)and the late Richard Mulligan playing a vain nearly psychopathic General Custer.The digital transfer preserves the original aspect ratio of the film and the nearly flawless print shows very little digital compression problems. This disc is enhanced for 16X9 widescreen TVs. The 139 minute production is presented on a dual layer disc for maximum picture quality. I didn't detect any analog artifacts (or at the very least very few). The color is fairly true to the original release as far as I can tell. The sound presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 surround and Stereo Surround has some compression problems and sounds a little bit flat but that could be due to the original recording as well. The packaging says nothing about the sound being remixed for 5.1 so it's difficult to say how much restorage and changes were done to the soundtrack.The drawbacks to this disc are few but important. There's no extras included. I'm sure the original theatrical trailer was available as were interviews with the stars and director during the film's original release. None of these vintage interviews are included. My guess is that Paramount chose to use the budget tp insure a high quality print and good sound. That's fine but it's a pity as Little Big Man is every bit the classic (and deserves the same treatment)as Casablanca, Patton and Dr. Strangelove. Paramount has been somewhat reluctant with many of their releases to DVD to provide extras (witness Chinatown, any of the Star Trek film releases--with the exception of the recently reissued films) Sure, there have been exceptions (The Godfather series)but most of those exceptions have been few and far between. If Paramount can't do justice to these classic films perhaps they should do an initial release and then license them to a specialty house (like Criterion or Anchor Bay)to provide a special features packed edition. Interviews with Dustin Hoffman and Faye Dunaway would have enhanced this classic film. Perhaps neither one of these surviving cast members was interested in participating.Little Big Man is one of Penn's finest films  along with Night Moves and Bonnie & Clyde).
