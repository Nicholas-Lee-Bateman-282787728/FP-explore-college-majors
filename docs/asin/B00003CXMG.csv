The Beatles are no longer speaking, the Rolling Stones are making the first of their many bad albums, Hendrix and Morrison have kicked the can and Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath and The Who are almost over.  The dust is settling and a decade of great music is quickly fading.&quot;Almost Famous&quot; is equally about the love of music as about the story of a band.  The characters and plot are well crafted and it's even more interesting to watch because it's Crowe's autobiography.  Anyone who has a deep love of music will probably enjoy this movie, especially the many references to (what I consider to be) good music (&quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, &quot;Raw Power&quot;, &quot;White Light/White Heat&quot;, etc).Whether you're just looking for good entertainment or furthur proof that you're not crazy for loving music as much as you do, you will like it.",5,A great tribute to the spirit of rock and roll,983491200,"03 2, 2001",2001,977,"['Lester', 'Bangs', 'main', 'character', 'William', 'Miller', 'quot', 'too', 'bad', 'missed', 'rock', 'roll.', 'quot', 'year', '1973', 'Beatles', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'speaking', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'are', 'making', 'first', 'many', 'bad', 'albums', 'Hendrix', 'Morrison', 'have', 'kicked', 'can', 'Led', 'Zeppelin', 'Black', 'Sabbath', 'Who', 'are', 'almost', 'dust', 'settling', 'decade', 'great', 'music', 'quickly', 'fading.', 'quot', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'quot', 'equally', 'love', 'music', 'story', 'band', 'characters', 'plot', 'are', 'well', 'crafted', 'even', 'more', 'interesting', 'watch', 'Crowe', 'autobiography', 'Anyone', 'who', 'deep', 'love', 'music', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'especially', 'many', 'references', 'what', 'consider', 'be', 'good', 'music', 'quot', 'Pet', 'Sounds', 'quot', 'quot', 'Raw', 'Power', 'quot', 'quot', 'White', 'Light/White', 'Heat', 'quot', 'etc', ""'re"", 'just', 'looking', 'good', 'entertainment', 'furthur', 'proof', ""'re"", 'not', 'crazy', 'loving', 'music', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'will', 'like']",Almost Famous

She also a charming relationship with the main character. Hudson's character is convincing and lovable, in spite of her obvious issues.Patrick Fugit does a great job as the teenage lead.

528830,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,B00003CXMG,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[4, 4]","Wow.  Finally a movie that got the early seventies right.  After suffering through 25 years of botched references, crummy plotting and themes that run either to the sticky-sweet or to the satanic, at last we have a film that is true to its era and will be enjoyed by the millions of people who remember it fondly--and, I hope, by millions of younger people too.The plot is pretty straightforward.  A sexually naive but musically sophisticated 15-year-old talks himself into writing an article about a (fictional) 1973 rock band called Stillwater for Rolling Stone magazine.  He goes out with the band on tour and has to wrestle with keeping his journalistic integrity intact in the face of his growing affection for the band.  Along the way are various plot twists and sexual hijinks that I don't want to spoil--let's just say that the film is a rollicking good time but it never seems forced--it's very true to life and in my opinion captures the wide-open mood of the late sixties/early seventies in good spirit.All the characters are great, especially Billy Crudup as the band's lead singer and Frances McDermott as the rock-hating intellectual mother.  Try, just try to find a visual anachronism.  I couldn't, and I'm usually pretty good at spotting a too-new car or clothing style or song.  This is a tremendous movie, extremely satisfying, and I can recommend it to anyone who qualifies for its MPAA rating.",5,"Almost perfect, if not downright perfect",970790400,"10 6, 2000",2000,1413,"['Wow', 'Finally', 'movie', 'got', 'early', 'seventies', 'right', 'suffering', '25', 'years', 'botched', 'references', 'crummy', 'plotting', 'themes', 'run', 'sticky-sweet', 'satanic', 'last', 'have', 'film', 'true', 'era', 'will', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'millions', 'people', 'who', 'remember', 'fondly', 'hope', 'millions', 'younger', 'people', 'too.The', 'plot', 'pretty', 'straightforward', 'sexually', 'naive', 'musically', 'sophisticated', '15-year-old', 'talks', 'writing', 'article', 'fictional', '1973', 'rock', 'band', 'called', 'Stillwater', 'Rolling', 'Stone', 'magazine', 'out', 'band', 'tour', 'wrestle', 'keeping', 'journalistic', 'integrity', 'intact', 'face', 'growing', 'affection', 'band', 'way', 'are', 'various', 'plot', 'twists', 'sexual', 'hijinks', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'film', 'rollicking', 'good', 'time', 'never', 'forced', 'very', 'true', 'life', 'opinion', 'wide-open', 'mood', 'late', 'sixties/early', 'seventies', 'good', 'spirit.All', 'characters', 'are', 'great', 'especially', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'band', 'lead', 'singer', 'Frances', 'McDermott', 'rock-hating', 'intellectual', 'mother', 'Try', 'just', 'try', 'find', 'visual', 'anachronism', 'could', ""n't"", ""'m"", 'usually', 'pretty', 'good', 'spotting', 'too-new', 'car', 'clothing', 'style', 'song', 'tremendous', 'movie', 'extremely', 'satisfying', 'can', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'MPAA', 'rating']",Almost Famous

528835,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00003CXMG,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","To be completely honest, when I first saw this film about five years ago I was under-whelmed.  It had been hyped up and won all sorts of awards and received so much attention, and really I didn't see why.  I was disappointed to say the least.  Then last night I decided to give it another shot.  Removing myself completely from the hype and praise and just amercing myself into the film was a huge plus for me, and I walked away from the experience singing it's praises like a church choir.  The film moved me in ways I didn't remember the first time; its rich sense of honesty ringing through with every frame.  The script is so real and raw, which I attest to the fact that director Cameron Crowe wrote this as a semi-autobiographic tale, and that first hand insight really gives `Almost Famous' an edge as possible his best film to date (and that's saying a lot since he has always been a genuinely talented director).`Almost Famous' tells the story of William Miller (a fictional representation of Cameron Crowe), a young kid sheltered by his mothers iron fist, the same fist that drove away his older sister Anita.  At fifteen Miller gets the chance of a lifetime, to follow around the rockband Stillwater and write an article for Rolling Stone about the band on the road.  What he finds within their world is something starkly contrasts to anything he imagined.  It is a world that entices and appeals to him, but at the same time it's a world that conflicts with his inner person, especially as he watches the fame tear the band apart and take out innocent bystanders in the wake.  Stillwater is still trying to find its sea-legs so-to-speak and the process proceeds to shake up the members and all those in their company.The performances by most the entire cast is strong and lends much support to Crowe's vision.  Billy Crudup and Jason Lee are effective as the feuding band leaders.  Crudup plays Russell Hammond, the lead guitarist filled with mystery, the one that everyone wants to be with.  Crudup does a good job of filtering through his characters inner contempt for the corruption within his profession.  When he's speaking with William's mother in the phone you can read in his voice his disgust with the whole `fame and fortune' aspect of his life.  Jason Lee is slightly less effective as Jeff Bebe, the jealous lead singer of Stillwater.  I didn't think he could completely sell his character.  I've never been impressed with Lee to tell the truth, and while his performance is not `terrible' it is merely passable here.  He tends to try and oversell things, and it got on my nerves a tad.  Patrick Fugit still seems a little green to me (but then again, when this was made he was green, right?) but he has a feeling of honesty in his performance that works well for what Crowe was attempting.  Fugit comes off uncomfortable with his performance, which I think aids in creating the vibe that he is a real fifteen-year-old kid who, lets face it, is pretty uncomfortable with himself.The three standouts here though are McDormand, Hoffman and especially Hudson, all of whom raise the bar for the rest of the actors in the film.  Philip Seymour Hoffman is rarely seen moving around, but his grasp of his characters idealisms has a strong influence on the film.  Frances McDormand really gets under her characters skin (that of William's overbearing mother Elaine) and draws out such unrestrained emotion that you can't help but feel for her in every scene, even the ones she doesn't embody.  For every scene she is not though, there is Kate Hudson, who is so effervescent as Penny Lane I can't help but adore her.  Her innocent devotion to a machine that just wants to use her, a machine that doesn't care enough about her to deserve her unwavering adoration is just so raw and believable and sympathetically captivating I just can't help but fall in love with her.Truth be told though, this film is all about Cameron Crowe.  His stamp of reality is felt on every frame.  The audience is allowed to become completely absorbed into the world in which he himself was found at such a young age (at eighteen Crowe wrote for Rolling Stone Magazine, and this film is based on his `adventures' so-to-speak).  His direction is flawless, but even more amazing is the script, which bleeds on every page the smell of honesty.

What was I thinking?Every now and then a movie grabs me, and I watch the DVD literally every day for a couple of months. Contact. L.A. Confidential. 54. That sort of thing. And now, Almost Famous. This movie works on so many levels and rings so absolutely true from start to finish that you don't watch it, you live it. If you were around in the 70's, and you didn't live under a rock, you knew this world, in the same way that a young boy feels he knows the players on his favorite baseball team. I read Creem Magazine all the time. It was like a sacrament. At last, I get to see the other side, the lives of not only the people who wrote those sacred words, but also the people they wrote them about.Although there is plenty of star power here, all the monumentally talented actors are still unknown enough to bring nothing but talent to their roles. There's no star baggage or hype. Even Kate Hudson, the archtypical Hollywood insider, is fresh and new and utterly believable. The exception, of course, is Frances McDormand. As an Oscar winner and three time nominee, she's nobody's unknown, but her gift for loosing herself in memorable roles shines again as the mother of a young Carmeron Crowe-like character angsting over the sudden maturity thrust upon her prodigal son.There are moments; the band on a bus singing ""Tiny Dancer"", the guitarist on the roof proclaiming ""I am a Golden God"" (once uttered in real life by Robert Plant), and just about every scene with Patrick Fugit, who is nothing short of amazing, where this movie transcends its medium, its message, and becomes something much more. It's a time portal and a crystal ball and a backstage pass all in one. It lets you relive your childhood and fill in the parts that were denied to you the first time around.Don't miss this movie, and don't wait too long before you see it.

528839,AK6UVFSU07NXH,B00003CXMG,Anthony Hinde,"[3, 3]","Cameron Crowe wrote and directed &quot;Almost Famous&quot;, which is fitting since it is largely about his own beginnings. Cameron was the youngest writer for Rolling Stone magazine and, as a teenage journalist, he followed numerous bands as they went on tour. In this film, these bands are rolled up into a four-man group called Stillwater. These guys get my vote for the best band that never was. Since I was just out of kindergarten when the story was set, you should forgive me for thinking, after my first viewing, that Stillwater was an authentic recreation of some famous group from the early 70's. The realism is that perfect!But this movie is not about a band, at least not predominantly. It is a  coming of age story. A young man raised in an unusual household, with an unusual mother, is taking his first steps to adulthood. The interesting thing is that his first steps are so large as to stretch past most people's entire careers. Through a combination of talent, luck and timing, young William Miller, played perfectly by Patrick Fugit, is recruited by Rolling Stone magazine to write an article on Stillwater. This strange occurrence actually makes sense when you watch the film despite sounding ridiculous as I write it.If William goes through dramatic changes in a short time, his mother is a rock of stability. Elaine Miller is able to &quot;freak out&quot; most people, with a few choice words but to her son, she is home, safety, love and in a way... imprisonment. She is very intense but caring and it is this combination which drives her eighteen year old daughter to a life of airline stewardship. We can see Elaine's true courage however, when she agrees to let the fifteen year old William go &quot;on the road&quot; with a drug taking,  womanizing rock band. This, after we have seen her characterize Simon and Garfuncle as &quot;stoned&quot; and forbidden their music from her house.One of the most important people William comes into contact with, on his journey, is Penny Lane. She is a beautiful, glowing, perfectly permed young dryad who follows the bands and has a following of her own. Adamant that she is not a groupie, Penny has created a concept called &quot;Band Aids.&quot; Her subscribers refrain from sex with the performers in an effort to more truly embrace the pure experience. She talks a good game but in the end, she's just a young woman in love. The object of her affection is Russell Hammond, the lead guitarist and Zen-master for Stillwater. Her situation is complicated after William falls in love with her, at first sight.Thus Alice enters Wonderland and many an adventure is had. Despite William's best intentions and the good advice of his mentor, Lester Bangs, the band manages to seduce him. His plan, to get in and out before missing a test, is soon discarded in the face of a larger than life rock and roll experience. There is one truly touching scene where the band, (and company), is riding their bus to the next gig and singing along to &quot;Tiny Dancer.&quot; William leans over to Penny and says, &quot;I have to go home!&quot; To which she replies, with a magical pass of her hand, &quot;You are home.&quot; That says it all.There are several contrasting character changes happening during the film.  One stands out more than most. William starts his professional career as a fan, loving the band, the music and the whole lifestyle. As the tour progresses and his eyes are opened, he becomes, not jaded but more worldly, professional and wise. Conversely, Penny Lane is introduced to us as the epitome of sophistication. She is young but knowing, and handles William as an older sister might. As the film progresses we discover that Penny is not so all knowing as she seemed. She is just as fragile and naively hopeful as any other girl her age. In the end, it is William that has to send her a reality check.Everything about this film is fascinating. The music is just wonderful, with Billy Crudup and Jason Lee bringing authenticity to every performance. The band's interpersonal dynamic is almost a character of its own. This climaxes during the famous plane crash scare, when each confesses their deepest secrets to the unrestrained laughter of the audience. William, his Mother and Penny are all unforgettable creations. Crowe is a wonderful writer, so good in fact, that I am disappointed he didn't turn this story into a book.

Funny, inspiring, and at times heartwarming, and backed by one of the best soundtracks ever, ""Almost Famous"" is a cinematic masterpiece that I would place right up there along with ""Goodfellas"" and ""The Godfather"". IT IS MY FAVORITE MOVIE.The film (based on Crowe's younger day) takes place in 1973. William Miller (Patrick Fugit) is a 15 year old amateur rock journalist for Cream Magazine. Mentored by world renowned rock writer Lester Bangs (a perfectly snide Philip Seymour Hoffman), he is given by the biggest assignment of his life. He is hired by Rolling Stone to pen an article of the up and coming rock band Stillwater. He is sent out on tour with them, much to the dismay of his overprotective mother (the always wonderful Francis McDormand). He becomes close with the band, but mostly with the band's disillusioned and drug addicted guitarist, Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup). He also meets the woman who will change his life: ""band aid"" Penny Lane (Kate Hudson, who steals the show). Over the course of the tour, William does a lot of growing up, and learns of the harsh realities of the music industry. By the time the tour is over, he is no longer the 15 year old boy he was when he left.This movie is amazing. The cast is wonderful, and the soundtrack is the greatest ever put onto a film (this can be said for several of Crowe's film soundtracks).

That this idea has merit is substantiated by this remarkable period piece both written and directed by Cameron Crowe. As he did in his quite captivating original screenplay for ""Fast Times At Ridgemont High"", he mines his personal background with an uncanny ear for realistic situations, dialogue, and personal experience to pull us deep into the quirky and sometimes surrealistic world of sixties rockThe protagonist of the film is a teen-something reporter for Rolling Stone magazine, and like Crowe, has an eyes-wide-open view of everything swirling around him, from sex, drugs and rock and roll to all the happenings associated with the rock and roll lifestyle itself. One finds William (newcomer Patrick Fugit) sucked into the vortex of a fictitious rock band's pulsating experience, and the moment to moment happenings surrounding Stillwater are so realistic, believable, and palpable that we roll along with it all, finding too much to remember from what we recall of the sixties. Also excellent are the ensemble of supposed Stillwater rock musicians, from Billy Crudup to Jason Lee, and the very lovely Kate Hudson showing her future potential as a leading lady in a powerful and convincing role here.This is the closest any of us are likely to come to living vicariously in a rock and roll band. The fact is that Cameron Crowe actually did experience a lot of what goes down here himself as a sixteen year old reporter, and the verve and energy in the film owes to this authentic recollection of those times, and to his uncanny ear for all the elements of the rock scene. This is a terrific movie, and although it is fiction, is also quite representative of the times it purports to describe.

So credit must go to the director for this scene.It might be too sugary for some tastes, but I found it just about sweet enough, i cringed in all the right places, i laughed a lot, i envied the main character and so generally fell into every emotional trap the director set for us, not once, but on repeat viewings also.In short an excellent feel good movie, not quite Jerry Maguire, but close enough, and more importantly, different.I should also note the special features, which were very good and added value to the dvd, especially so the Rolling Stones articles of a young Cameron Crowe, which consisted of in-depth interviews with (amongst others) Led Zeppelin, Joni Mitchell and Neil Young, fascinating reading, especially as I've already said, i have a soft spot for some artists from this time, these being some of them.",5,An excellent feel good movie,1006819200,"11 27, 2001",2001,2123,"['liked', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'other', 'well', 'known', 'effort', 'Jerry', 'Maguire', 'then', 'movie', 'will', 'probably', 'leave', 'same', 'satisfied', 'quot', 'quot', 'feeling', 'same', 'silly', 'grin', 'face.A', 'semi', 'autobiographical', 'work', 'humor', 'sentimentalism', 'strong', 'cast', 'ultimatly', 'leaving', 'affectionate', 'look', 'back', 'rock', 'culture', 'what', 'musicians', 'fans', 'alike.Patrick', 'Fugit', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'young', 'man', 'question', 'Billy', 'Crudrup', 'always', 'great', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'Chasing', 'Amy', 'Mallrats', 'are', 'equally', 'good', 'support.Kate', 'Hudson', 'revelation', 'Penny', 'Lane', 'same', 'beauty', 'strange', 'mixture', 'innoncence', 'yet', 'world', 'weariness', '70', 'Holly', 'Golightly', 'end', 'movie', 'feel', 'could', 'fall', 'love', 'instant', 'anything', 'credibility', 'fact', 'most', 'men', 'movie', 'seem', 'do', 'this.The', 'soundtrack', 'fantastic', 'do', 'have', 'soft', 'spot', 'kind', 'music', 'late', '60', 'early', '70', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'fan', 'artists', 'used', 'was', 'perfectly', 'complimentary', 'scene', 'tour', 'bus', 'Elton', 'John', 'quot', 'Tiny', 'Dancer', 'quot', 'never', 'make', 'smile', 'feel', 'good', 'i', ""'ve"", 'never', 'liked', 'music', 'slightest', 'credit', 'must', 'go', 'director', 'scene.It', 'might', 'be', 'too', 'sugary', 'tastes', 'found', 'just', 'sweet', 'enough', 'i', 'cringed', 'right', 'places', 'i', 'laughed', 'lot', 'i', 'envied', 'main', 'character', 'so', 'generally', 'fell', 'emotional', 'trap', 'director', 'set', 'not', 'once', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'also.In', 'short', 'excellent', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'not', 'quite', 'Jerry', 'Maguire', 'close', 'enough', 'more', 'importantly', 'different.I', 'should', 'also', 'note', 'special', 'features', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'added', 'value', 'dvd', 'especially', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'articles', 'young', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'consisted', 'in-depth', 'interviews', 'amongst', 'others', 'Led', 'Zeppelin', 'Joni', 'Mitchell', 'Neil', 'Young', 'fascinating', 'reading', 'especially', ""'ve"", 'already', 'said', 'i', 'have', 'soft', 'spot', 'artists', 'time', 'being']",Almost Famous

528858,A8TM0MI3D9T29,B00003CXMG,Brett Corkins,"[1, 3]","Before taking the plunge and buying the rather high-priced director's cut, I figured I'd watch the original version first. I have always known about this movie, but when it first came out I didn't appreciate classic rock like I do now. Knowing this had to do with a rock band, and also knowing all the hype that surrounded it during it's release, I finally decided to watch it. I wasn't completely sure of what to expect when I bought it, but being a Kate Hudson fan, I had a feeling it'd be good. I found I was completely correct in this assumption a mere 20 minutes into the film. But I also went into this movie thinking it was solely about Kate. I was a bit dissappointed to find it wasn't, but I feel that Patrick Fugit had a more compelling story behind his character.This movie follows William Miller (Fugit) through a once in a lifetime experience. By faking his age, Rolling Stone unknowingly hires him to do an article about an up-and-coming band called Stillwater. Along the way he meets, and befriends, a ""Band Aid"" who calls herself 'Penny Lane.' She basically shows him how a band functions. He also befriends the band's guitarist, Russell Hammond. While the rest of the band refers to William as 'the enemy,' Russell looks past that and becomes a kind of role model for him, taking him under his wing. But when it comes time to turn in his article, William finds he still hasn't had an interview with the most popular person in the band, Russell. So William writes about his experiences with the band. When the magazine calls to confirm the authenticity of the article, the band says it's all false. There's the basic story.But this movie is about more than just the story, it's also about the music. It features one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard, and the rousing sing-along of Elton John's 'Tiny Dancer' is worth the price alone.With memorable performances from everyone involved, this movie is without a doubt the best one I've seen in years. I wasn't expecting Patrick Fugit to do very good in a leading role (I saw 'Saved!' and didn't think he did as good as he could've), but he shows he can carry a movie as well as the next person. But the true standout is definitely Kate Hudson. She has the ability to make every one of her characters likeable and truthful to real life people, and it's no different in this film.

An age of music and of everything but music.It's the early 70's and 15 year old William Miller(Fugit) is infatuated by the immense world of rock and roll music. Such obsession is brought on by an early experience of his sister leaving home, giving him all her albumns(The Who, Led Zeppelin etc) to let the music set him free from his over-protective mother(McDormand).Miller follows the example of a cynical battle-hardened music critic Lester Bangs(Hoffman) and his own music reviews get noticed by Rolling Stone magazine. Rolling Stone, unaware of the fact he's 15, sends Miller on tour with &quot;Stillwater&quot; a ficticious band that might as well be a real one as it is portrayed expertly without cliches. On the road, he meets Penny Lane(Hudson) Shes not a groupie, shes a band-aid. Penny shows Miller the otherworldness of rock music. She shows him it's heart and soul personified by Stillwater. All the while being checked on by his mother, Miller desperatley tries to get an ever-growing story into Rolling stone on time. A crucial element to said story is an interview with the elusive yet emotional guitarist Russell Hammond(Crudup) The conflicts between the members of the band and the ever-present hysteria of 70's rock and roll bombard Miller in this powerful film with a wonderful pace and brilliant performances.

I was just starting to discover rock in the late seventies and aside from the actual LP's and AOR radio, Creem magazine was a guide and a bible.  I remember the dedication and memorial in Creem when Lester Bangs died.  It was great to see Philip Seymour Hoffman portraying the original &quot;gonzo rock journalist&quot; and getting to hear a sliver of Bangs's twisted, enthusiastic views on music and being a rock fan.  You can't hide the nerd music lover behind the facade of the cynical rock writer.  I also love his hatred of Rolling Stone, a magazine that regular readers of Creem always knew was a poser and pretender in the world of rock magazines.The cast are superb.  The boy, Patrick Fugit, is charming and perfectly cast as a shy, naive fledgling reporter.  A lot has been written about Kate Hudson's performance and it's all true.  She convey's self-assuredness and insecurity at the same time.  Billy Crudup's character is likable, despite his bad behavior.  the supporting cast are all outstanding.The movie, as Cameron Crowe points out in the featurette included on the DVD, is a love letter to seventies rock, the people who perform it and the fans that love it, as a result it's a lightweight film.

In the process of being confronted by such an individual, Joni happened to remember a night when she wanted to crash a party, and someone at the door, who had been dubious about letting any stranger in, suddenly realized that Joni Mitchell being there was more cool than anything that had ever happened in the young lives of the people who had been invited.  As I remember the interview, Joni was 36 and wondering if she might find a man who would be around long enough (six year minimum in modern times) for her to be an appropriate mother, and she wasn't likely to find him at that party, which was sometime when she was much younger, anyway.

528867,A2PBV1899CX3TE,B00003CXMG,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[3, 3]","I just readLet's Spend the Night Together: Backstage Secrets of Rock Muses and Supergroupies, by Pamela Des Barres, and one of the chapters was an interview with director Carmeron Crowe. There are 2 dozen interviews, and there is only one other male interviewed, male groupie Pleather. The book chronicles the exploits of groupie's, from Mary Magdalen, through Tura Satana, Pamela herself, Cynthia Plaster Caster, Gail Zappa, Sweet, Sweet Connie of Little Rock, Lori Lightning, Bebe Buell, and Pleasant Gehman, among others. The reason for the inclusion of Cameron is for the film, Almost Famous, and the character of Penny Lane, played by Kate Hudson. She is NOT a groupie, she is a Band-Aid, and the young journalist, William Miller (Patrick Fugit), in an early scene in the film, also claims he is NOT a groupie. I recently emailed Tura Satana, and she also claimed she wasn't a groupie either. She just happened to have had a fling with Elvis, among others. Sure, Tura wasn't a groupie, and maybe you could even say that Elvis was her groupie. Penny Lane, the non-groupie character in Almost Famous, says that groupies do it for the thrill of getting close to someone famous, but ""Band-Aids"" do it for the love of the music. A better term for them is ""Muse"" as in someone who inspires an Artist or Musician.Anywhat, Almost Famous is mostly a thinly veiled autobiography of Cameron Crowe, the film director who began writing for Rolling Stone at the tender age of 16. After such an auspicious beginning, he went on to directSay Anything,Jerry Maguire,Vanilla Sky,Singles, andFast Times at Ridgemont High (Widescreen Special Edition).Penny Lane, Polexia Aphrodisia (Anna Paquin), and the other women are somewhat peripheral. Elaine Miller (Frances McDormand), his mother, and his older sister Anita Miller (Zooey Deschanel), play just as pivotal a role in the young auteur's rite of passage. Mother and daughter can't get along, but before she splits to become a Stewardess, older sister leaves him a stash of Rock Albums that will transform his life. Important male figures are Rock Critic/mentor Lester Bangs (Philip Seymour Hoffman), Rolling Stone editors Ben Fong-Torres and Jan Wenner, and the members of Stillwater, who the young journalist is desperately trying to interview for his first feature story.The band Stillwater is totally fictional, yet they are somewhat of an amalgamation of The Allman Brothers and Led Zeppelin, say around the time ofEat a PeachandLed Zeppelin IV (aka ZOSO). Probably more Allman Brothers, though not nearly as Southern, with a charismatic guitarist, Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup), representing Duanne Allman, and a talented, though overshadowed, lead singer--shades of Greg Allman--Jeff Bebe (Jason Lee).Jason Lee is of course very familiar from the TV show My Name is Earl, but eerily, he also plays David Seville, manager of The Chipmonks, in the recent remake of that seminal prototype to The Monkees, The Archies, Josie and the Pussycats, Gorrilaz, and other pop music/cartoon, and/or television projects. What is eerie about it is that the opening scene of Almost Famous, the first music heard, is actually the aforementioned Chipmonks, as the young William Miller (Michael Angarano) listens on the radio. Back to Jason Lee, though, he not only sang well, he also acted his part superbly, bristling in the shadow of egomaniac Russell Hammond. Crudup's character is revealed when he attends a party with some mid-west locals, takes a psychedelic drug, and jumps off the house into a swimming pool, proclaiming ""I am a Golden God.""The DVD includes as a bonus some of Cameron's articles written for Rolling Stone, and they really shed a lot of light on the subject. The Allman Brothers story is written after Duanne Allman's fatal motorcycle accident. Perhaps, then, the Russell Hammond character is based on Jimmy Page, as another important interview of the young scribe was done of Led Zeppelin, who despite their huge success and tremendous album sales, were continuously slagged by critics, chief amongst them, Rolling Stone. There is a lot of mistrust and animus between musician and journalist. When they meet, they nickname him Enemy. Meanwhile, mentor Lester Bangs warns him, whatever you do, don't become their friend.The music for Stillwater was written by Cameron and his wife, Nancy Wilson, of female heavy metal group, Heart. The actors who played the band, Stillwater, were coached by Peter Frampton, who actually got them ready to perform within a few months with a little intense Rock Star Fantasy Boot Camp training. One of the Rolling Stone interviews is of Frampton, just after the huge success ofFrampton Comes Alive!, and just prior to the release of the ill-advised filmSgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. In the preface to that interview, he confesses that he broke the cardinal rule of Rock Journalism, as laid down by Lester Bangs: Don't befriend the musicians. Knowing what a fiasco and career wrecker the movie would be, one can only wonder why he would let his so-called friend make such a disastrous movie. But the amiable Frampton took his success in stride, and seems to have also taken his subsequent fall from grace quite well.But I digress, and just let me say here that the inclusion of the Rolling Stone articles is quite a bonus, as they not only illuminate what goes on in the movie, but also validate the protagonist's saga. Because, if he had sucked as a writer, what a silly story that would have been. But the writing is very impressive, and all the more so when you consider the author's tender age.Patrick Fugit, playing the Cameron Crowe/William Miller character does a fantastic job of acting as well. He yearns to be cool, but he is so not. He has a crush on Penny Lane, and one scene where he is deflowered by some of the other ""groupies"" is quite tastefully handled, well-acted, and what is most striking is that he makes eye contact with Penny Lane throughout, and you feel that there is some kind of strange love between them, however unrequited it may be. Another scene has Penny asking him if he wants to go to Morocco with her, and he says ""Yes,"" then asks her to ask him again. It was later revealed in the ""Making of"" footage that he was asking for another take, but they left it in because it was spontaneous and captured an ethereal quality of yearning. Another scene that shows Crowe's skill as a director was one in which Penny Lane (whose real name is finally revealed as Lady Goodman) is smashed on qualudes. As she rolls around vomiting in her diaphanous lingerie, and the young journalist calls for emergency medical assistance, the soundtrack plays Stevie Wonder singing My Cherie Amour.

It has wit, great pacing and editing, and a big heart.  The music is okay though it can never be mistaken for being the soul of the story; the soul belongs to the characters.  All the characters are fully realized but Kate Hudson, whose character Penny Lane insists she is the rock group's muse not its groupie, takes her role to greater depths without eating the scenery. She deserved the Oscar nomination.  Ultimately, the film is a bit gentle--it does not amend or revise our cultural insight into the era and environment it portrays; it is not a take-no-prisoners satire; it does not bleed--and that's why I'm giving it a 4 rather than a 5.

He meets Lester Bangs, a legendary critic/journalist who warns him of rock stars. He gives him an assignment to do a writing on a Black Sabbath concert and get an interview but he's not allowed backstage. Until up-and-coming band Stillwater decides to bring him in. He becomes so well-liked that Rolling Stone offers to send him on tour with the band and do a piece on them. And so the journey begins.With a largely 60's-70's soundtrack and many classic scenes, it's kind of hard not to like the film.

No one has ever put into words, song, and action the *precise* effect that music has had on my life, and I feel indebted toward him for expressing that love in ways that I can't. Which is why I swooned throughout the entire movie the very first time I saw it, falling in love with each of the characters (Penny Lane especially, for her motherly concern for the well being of others, her fragile facade of iron will while being so obviously soft, and her unbelievably real sweetness). Penny Lane is a falling leaf in this film, beautiful and fragile and adrift on the changing winds of other's emotions. Yet, behind this exquisite frailty lies a masked strength of character and an almost regretful understanding of &quot;when and where the real world occurs.&quot;I found it only fitting, then, that the movie ended on my favorite song -- Zeppelin's underrated &quot;Rain Song.&quot; I feel this is perfectly appropriate for the scene, for its underappreciated beauty and time-capsule capture of that one fleeting sense of drifting away from innocence and daydreams, wanting to hold on, yet understanding and saying goodbye anyway... and trying to understand you were better for the experience. Now, when I hear this song, I envision the scene of the weary kiss blown from the fingers a tired fan as she watches the tour bus drive away into the morning, Penny Lane skirting the desolate and littered post-concert grounds with a rose and a smile, spinning on a napkin, and the innocent, unabashed brown love gaze of William Miller through the colored scarves of the band-aides.I can watch this movie a million times and I would give it as many stars if I could.

So, let me say that amidst all of the rightfully glowing praise this movie has received, let me add this: this film is the greatest depiction of mother-son love ever displayed in cinema.  The bond between young William and his &quot;wise&quot; sage of a mother is the true heart and soul of this story.  It is interesting that Cameron Crowe is such a fan of &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird.&quot;  That film is the best father-son (and daughter) film ever.  Both stories spring (ultimately) from the realization that a parent has to let their child experience life--as painful and exacting as that realization is to the parent.  Both stories demonstrate the deep admiration we all have (or should have) to parents standing up to the conventions of the times (racism or consumerism).  William is &quot;allowed&quot; to enter into his journey by a mother forever providing advice (&quot;Don't use drugs!&quot;) and &quot;meaning well.&quot;  The ensuing phone calls from the road and scenes with the glorious Frances McDormand are priceless.  The scene where McDormand sees her son after his &quot;trip&quot; is Oscar worthy--look at her love and relief that he's. . . HOME.  Further, her dressing down of Billy Crudup's character is one of the funniest scenes in any film (&quot;ye-yes, ma'am.&quot;)There are so many wonderful scenes in this film and the acting is superb. The ensemble is as good as any I've seen.  Phillip Seymour Hoffman as the lonely, uncool mentor is perfect.  Jason Lee as the egomaniacal (but ultimately vapid) lead singer is pulled off with aplomb.  Billy Crudup as the &quot;soul&quot; of rock and roll is the best.  This guy will win an Oscar someday though &quot;his looks are becoming a problem!&quot;But ultimately, it comes back again and again to me as this:  watch this film and bear witness to the most difficult thing any of us have to do in our lives as a matter of course--watch our children grow up and become independent of us, their parents.Almost Famous is beautiful, loving ode to motherhood (parenthood).

Every performance is wonderful- not a weak actor in the film though I have to give a special nod to Philip Seymour Hoffman as rock critic Lester Bangs- just a great fit.

The sound (both Dolby Digital and DTS) is great as is the picture quality.  The extras are many and the disappointments few.  Crowe's mom rocks as she watches a part of her life on the screen.

Then the other night it was on Bravo and I figured I had time, I might as well watch it.  Let me say that I'm glad I can finally say I've seen it, and what a wonderful experience it was.  Despite my feelings about the lack of talent young Patrick Fugit has, he's quickly offset by the other talent on the screen.  Kate Hudson delivers the best performance here with her Penny Lane, groupie extraordinaire who follows her favorite band `Stillwater', the same band that William (Fugit) is traveling with in order to write an article for a rock magazine.  Penny is such a free spirit, and she's so devoted to the music she loves that you're instantly drawn to her.  Billy Crudup also does well as the bands lead singer and Penny's crush, and Jason Lee is hilarious as the lead guitarist.  As I'm sure all have read that this is a fictional tale based on Cameron Crowe's younger years as a reporter for Creem and Rolling Stone and so as the director Crowe makes sure that the film has those personal touches that lift it from sheer entertainment and create a realistic and homey feel throughout the film.

It isn't a family movie, but the story is very interesting no matter who you are and what your age is (not to mention, it is based on actual events). It shows a common high school student at the time, with common likes and dislikes, and with dreams. Unlike his other friends and enemies, Patrick Fugit's character William Miller gets to live out his dream. I haven't ever met a member of a famous rock group, or seen anything big about their private life, but this movie is very in-depth with the detail to all of the rock stars lives.  It shows the viewers that rock stars are human beings. They do have to face many problems, just like the average citizen. The publicity of rock stars is displayed well. The lives of real rock stars from that time era seem to be very accurate with the movie. From the bonding while on tours to everything else. Patrick Fugit does a convincing performance as a starstruck 15 year old journalist major. He shows respect to everybody and is polite, but acts very emotionally. The movie is funny too and isn't all that explicit.  It is about a rock band of the 70s, and the movie has talk about drugs and sex, but it is more informative than offensive.

Cameron Crowe amazingly reflects on his times as a writer while traveling with legendary bands(Led Zeppelin, Allman Brothers, The Eagles, etc.).  He takes certain events that occurred during each tour and gives it to the movie's band.  Every piece of that fits perfectly amongst one another to create one masterpiece movie.  It's great that Crowe can make some of those serious events and put some comedy in them. Therefore, he was well-deserving of his Oscar win for Best Original Screenplay.Patrick Fugit makes a triumphant debut as William Miller.  If he continues to do movies in this style, he'll go far with his acting career.  Why did Marcia Gay Harden win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress(""Pollock"") over Kate Hudson as ""Penny Lane""?  Who knows.  Frances McDormand performs wonderfully outside her usual style as William Miller's overprotective mother.  This is Billy Crudup and Jason Lee at their best as the lead guitarist and lead singer of Stillwater.  Though Fairuza Balk and Anna Paquin had minor roles as band aids, their acting shined.

528891,A36L1F0YECOAW8,B00003CXMG,David Grant,"[0, 0]","'Almost Famous' is as much about music as it is about growing up. It's about embracing what you love and finding the willingness to let go, to move on, to fit in. Cameron Crowe's first film since his smash hit 'Jerry Maguire', 'Almost Famous' is the story of young William Miller (newcomer Patrick Fugit), a music fan, who lies his way into his dream job: touring with a rock n roll band while composing an article about them for Rolling Stone Magazine. The band he tours with is named Stillwater, four guys on the verge of stardom. Along the way, William meets a group of 'band-aids' (aka. groupies), one of which, a ravishing young girl  named Penny Lane (played wit great charm by Kate Hudson) with whom he eventually grows to love. All the while, his mother (Oscar winner Frances McDormand) sits at home, her over-protective instincts running wild. What transpires through the film is beautiful coming-of-age tale with humor and wit to burn. I'm a bit hesitant to reveal many plot details about the film. It's something you're better off not knowing much about. Experiencing the maturing of William and the painful realizations of fame that the band goes through during the tour is half the fun of the movie. You will get to know each character through-out the film. They will become your friends, your heroes, and you will cheer them on and weep for them. Such is the brilliant simplicity of Cameron Crowe who, as both writer and director, has fictionalized a portion of his own life to share with us. And I for one am grateful. It's rare that a movie has the power to effects it's audience in a way this film does. Much like William, we are newcomers to the world he experiences. William's slow realization that these guys in Stillwater might be larger then life when they are on stage, but when they are not, they are just as vulnerable as we are and just as human, is pure magic. The members of the band include Billy Crudup as the charismatic guitarist whose good looks cast him in the limelight, Jason Lee as the lead singer whose desire for attention creates tension through-out the group, and real-life musicians Mark Kozelek and John Fedevich. Their music was written by Crowe's wife Nancy Wilson of the group 'Heart' and was actually performed by the actors themselves. And they are quite good, both musically and performance wise. Lee continues to show his versatility and Crudup delivers his second great performance of 2000, the other in the wonderfully skewed 'Jesus's Son'. The rest of the cast sparkles as well with McDormand and Fugit convincingly playing mother and son, one desperate to stay close while the other begs for a little room to grow. But the film belongs to Kate Hudson, whose grace and tenderness leap from the screen, and to Philip Seymour Hoffman as the wise and cynical rock critic Lester Bangs, stealing every scene his is in. And to Cameron Crowe, who continues to turn everything he touches into pure gold. This is the best film of 2000 and one you cannot afford to miss.",5,Pure bliss.

It is close to  flawless.As usual, Crowe's gotten a superb ensemble cast  together. Philip Seymour Hoffman, Jason Lee, and Billy  Crudup are predictably great, but the real joy is newcomer Patrick  Fugit, whose winsome, innocent portrayal  of a  teen coming of age is pitch perfect.The  plot is gripping and unpredictable. The subject matter is intimately  familiar for anyone over the age of  25 or so,  but younger folks will also identify with the characters' love for  music.But the real strength, as with all  of Crowe's work, is the *writing*. Good writing is rare in movies of any  sort,  particularly this summer's blockbuster  sludge, but Crowe nails all the details of dialogue, characterization,  and pacing with unparalleled skill. You will laugh  out loud, repeatedly, and cry too, many times simultaneously.

528893,A1FDW1SPYKB354,B00003CXMG,David Von Pein,"[1, 1]","I had the awful feeling that I was going to hate this movie when I popped in this DVD for my inaugural look at the film. But my initial apprehension toward the picture vaporized almost instantly upon watching the film's first scene.I couldn't believe how much I liked this movie.  In my view, Director/Producer/Writer Cameron Crowe has done the near-impossible with this motion picture.  That being: He's taken a group of people that could have been so easily looked down upon and intensely disliked, and instead turned this assorted band of musicians, groupies, mothers, sisters, and rock-n-roll managers into some of the most interesting and fun-to-watch individuals ever to share a movie set together.Add to this mix one very likeable-right-off-the-bat young 15-year-old would-be music journalist (played to perfection by Patrick Fugit), and what you have in your midst is a highly-entertaining movie about ambition, music, a devoted mother's love, soul-searching, friendships, and chasing dreams.Every scene in this film is a memorable one. The whole movie feels ""real"", in this writer's opinion. Nothing seems faked, or phonied, or Hollywoodized. A reason for this, of course, is in large part due to the fact that the film is a great deal auto-biographical, with Fugit portraying Crowe when Cameron was a teenaged writer for Rolling Stone Magazine.And while it's rated ""R"" (for language and drug content), the film never once bogs itself down with the cliched rock band negativity of drugs, sex, and booze.  Sure, these elements are shown through Mr. Crowe's camera lens; but it's never displayed in such a way as to be a turnoff.  If this film were in the form of a book, it would indeed be described as a real ""page turner"".  The viewer anxiously awaits the next ""page"" (scene).There are two scenes in this film that are true ""set pieces"" in my mind (and after just seeing the movie one time).  One such piece occurs as the fictional band with which our talented young ""Rolling Stone"" journalist (""William Miller"") is travelling encounters severe turbulence on an airplane flight taking the group to its next concert date.  As the severe thunderstorm batters the plane to the point where all aboard are nearly convinced they'll soon be meeting an untimely demise, one by one the passengers begin to confess their inner-most secrets and indiscretions. This fabulous scene is at the same time comical, bittersweet, and poignant.  As the aircraft finally breaks free of the turbulent air, much to the delight of the exuberant pilots, our band of passengers is too mentally drained from the confessions they've just offered up to each other to join in the celebration of the fact that they are, in fact, going to survive the ordeal.  The scene concludes comically with a member of the group, who has just informed everyone of a dark secret concerning sexual orientation, slamming the cockpit door closed to silence the cheers of the pilots.  Great, great scene!Another highly-memorable portion of the film takes place on the band's tour bus.  Elton John can be heard on the bus radio, singing ""Tiny Dancer"".  Gradually, the vehicle is filled with singing, as everyone begins joining Elton in belting out the tune.  This scene is one to play over and over again, as the feeling of togetherness and harmony fills the bus at that moment.The DVD presentation here is as flawless as the film contained on the disc.  Picture quality is exceptional via the nice 1.85:1 Widescreen Anamorphic transfer. And the Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround soundtrack is definitely robust enough to give those speakers a nice workout, especially during the many musical numbers heard throughout the movie.There's an adequate Making-Of featurette included as well, which contains several photos of a young Cameron Crowe ""on the road"" as a Rolling Stone scribe.For anyone who hasn't seen this picture who might be thinking (as I did before viewing it) that this is a movie filled with loud, obnoxious, cocaine-snorting booze-heads and the less-than-desirable environs that people of that ilk generally inhabit, let me assure you that ""Almost Famous"" will pleasantly surprise you.These characters are well-written, never ""over the top"", and totally engaging from the first chapter of this DVD until the last.It immediately has zoomed into my Top 25 of all-time favorite flicks!I still can't believe how truly good this movie is.  It's one that could easily be viewed time and again, and enjoyed just as much with each successive screening.",5,A Triumph!

Well, that ...... not only didn't get paused, I ended up reading those priceless Rolling Stone Interviews until 3 AM! While not quite American Graffiti, it was still an excellant movie. I agree that the voters for the Acadamy awards were too busy fawning over Russell Crowe to give this one a fair shot, but that's ok, we the folks who really appreciate Almost Famous, know a good movie when we see one. I am only two years younger than Crowe, and this movie took me right back to the 70's, and rock's last blast. Now, here is my only criticism of this movie, and it is a serious one. By naming the fictional band ""Stillwater"", they have stolen the identity of the real 70's band of that name. The real Stillwater was Capricorn Records' stablemate of the Allman Brothers., Fronted by Jimmy Hall, Stillwater had a hit with a song called ""Mindbender"" co-written by Buddy Buie of The Atlanta Rhythm Section back in 1977. Very cool song, the chorus, ""My daddy was a Gibson, my mama was a Fender, that's why they call me, Mindbender.."" was sung through a talkbox, ala Joe Walsh and Peter Frampton. (I am surprized that Cameron Crowe overlooked or ignored that. Plus, in a search on online, I have found another band named Stillwater, with a CD released in 1998. Hence, my opening question, Just how many Stillwaters are there? Well time to watch this one again, Almost Famous is 2 hours well spent.

Cameron Crowe has made a movie about a fictional rock band and all that goes with it (including groupies), and gotten it RIGHT!!! The characters all have heart and soul, no matter what their flaws.  As a result this movie is always entertaining, at times hilarious, and sometimes heartbreaking!  Every scene is excellent, all the main characters so fleshed out.  If Oliver Stone had directed this movie, you KNOW Penny Lane (the lead band-aid)would have been portrayed as a mindless bimbo.  Thank-gawd Cameron Crowe's in charge here!  Like the male characters, Penny is portrayed as a human being.  If you've enjoyed books by Pamela Des Barres (""I'm With The Band"") or Bebe Buell (""Rebel Heart""), you'll be especially thankful for Cameron's direction! All the actors are excellent.  I especially loved Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Lester Bangs, he really hit the nail on the head!  Equally colorful is Frances McDormand's performance as the over-protective mother.  The casting in this movie is perfect, as is the screenplay and direction!!!  It never stumbles!  Too bad Cameron Crowe didn't direct a movie on the Doors.

Well, we have a writer as the hero.  And...?  And he's in love.  And...?  Okay the rest is different except that he's really working hard to be a success and he's around performers and...  Anyway &quot;it's all happening.&quot;  By the way, that should be &quot;It's all happening at the zoo&quot; a lyric from the Simon and Garfunkel album in the opening scene.Okay, okay.  I'm having a little trouble with this one.  I thought it was just so, so cute, and so touching and warm, even though I know it's only &quot;[my] rock and roll fantasy.&quot;  However I don't care.  I watched practically the whole thing with tears in my eyes, partially from nostalgia from the music and the clothes and the hair styles done so perfectly, and partly because the story of &quot;Penny Lane,&quot; sweet flower child groupie, &quot;seamstress for the band&quot; (to borrow a lyric) who has a &quot;rock and roll record&quot; to borrow another lyric (Great White, this time) who wears her sophistication on her sleeve to cover her heart that's also there.  And for a slightly nerdish kid who grows up before our eyes and falls in love and is too young to really be loved in return, a nervous writer on his first assignment who overwrites and sees the best in people, even as they treat him like a little girl, a kid who is so, so unsure of himself.  (Is writer and director Cameron Crowe again reprising his youth as he did so well in the script for the now classic coming of ager, Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982)?)Kate Hudson (Goldie Hawn's daughter) is unforgettable in a completely original creation dreamed up (or better yet, probably remembered) by Crowe, who here improves on his fine directorial work in Jerry Maguire (1996).  I understand that Sarah Polley (The Sweet Hereafter 1997) was originally picked to play the part of Penny Lane, and she is a fine talent, but quite frankly Kate Hudson stole all the scenes she was in (she learned it from her mother!) and I don't think the movie would have been quite the beguiling, bittersweet experience it was without her.Billy Crudup (a name to look at twice) manages to look exactly like all the wanna-be rock stars of the seventies wished they had while exuding the kind of charm that breaks hearts as Russell Hammond, guitarist for the band and Penny's true love.  Patrick Fugit is William Miller the would be teenaged writer as hero who is charming, boyish, vulnerable and well, heroic.  Frances McDormand plays his mother with just the right combination of pigheaded earnestness and her unique sense of the comedic.The entire cast was terrific and the characters were truly original.  The Academy Award winning script was clever and at times profound, interspersed with sparkling lines.  (My favorite, from Lester Bangs on William's school mates: &quot;You'll meet them all again on their long journey to the middle.&quot;)  Also, and this is important, Crowe paid close attention to detail throughout and never lost his concentration.  Everything seemed amazingly authentic right down to the floral stitch on Russell's shirts and the bottles of Jack Daniels in his hands.  And nothing was done in a routine manner.  Every scene was carefully planned and even minor characters were roundly developed.  I'm thinking in particular of Lester Bangs, mentor and cynical rock critic brought to life in a fine performance by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, and William's sweet and slightly dippy sister, vividly portrayed by Zooey Deschanel.  Notice how Crowe even took the trouble to satirize flight attendants with the parody of the stewardess uniforms (day glow orange!).Yes, I loved this film, and I predict that the Academy, whose members obviously did not really SEE this film, will be rewarding the producers sometime down the road for the oversight.",5,"Warm, sweet and brilliant",988416000,"04 28, 2001",2001,3932,"['time', 'do', 'writer', 'story', 'get', 'choked', 'up', 'like', 'Shakespeare', 'Love', 'only', 'different', 'Shakespeare', 'Love', 'WHAT', 'Well', 'have', 'writer', 'hero', 'love', 'rest', 'different', 'really', 'working', 'hard', 'be', 'success', 'performers', 'Anyway', 'quot', 'happening.', 'quot', 'way', 'should', 'be', 'happening', 'zoo', 'quot', 'lyric', 'Simon', 'Garfunkel', 'album', 'opening', 'scene.Okay', 'okay', ""'m"", 'having', 'little', 'trouble', 'one', 'thought', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'cute', 'so', 'touching', 'warm', 'even', 'know', 'only', 'quot', '[', ']', 'rock', 'roll', 'fantasy.', 'quot', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'watched', 'practically', 'whole', 'thing', 'tears', 'eyes', 'partially', 'nostalgia', 'music', 'clothes', 'hair', 'done', 'so', 'perfectly', 'partly', 'story', 'quot', 'Penny', 'Lane', 'quot', 'flower', 'child', 'groupie', 'quot', 'seamstress', 'band', 'quot', 'borrow', 'lyric', 'who', 'quot', 'rock', 'roll', 'record', 'quot', 'borrow', 'lyric', 'Great', 'White', 'time', 'who', 'sophistication', 'sleeve', 'cover', 'heart', 'also', 'there', 'slightly', 'nerdish', 'kid', 'who', 'up', 'eyes', 'falls', 'love', 'too', 'young', 'really', 'be', 'loved', 'return', 'nervous', 'writer', 'first', 'assignment', 'who', 'best', 'people', 'even', 'treat', 'little', 'girl', 'kid', 'who', 'so', 'unsure', 'Is', 'writer', 'director', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'again', 'reprising', 'youth', 'did', 'so', 'well', 'script', 'now', 'classic', 'coming', 'ager', 'Fast', 'Times', 'Ridgemont', 'High', '1982', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'daughter', 'unforgettable', 'completely', 'original', 'creation', 'dreamed', 'up', 'better', 'yet', 'probably', 'remembered', 'Crowe', 'who', 'here', 'fine', 'directorial', 'work', 'Jerry', 'Maguire', '1996', 'understand', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'Sweet', 'Hereafter', '1997', 'was', 'originally', 'picked', 'play', 'part', 'Penny', 'Lane', 'fine', 'talent', 'quite', 'frankly', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'stole', 'scenes', 'was', 'learned', 'mother', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'quite', 'beguiling', 'bittersweet', 'experience', 'was', 'her.Billy', 'Crudup', 'name', 'look', 'twice', 'look', 'exactly', 'wanna-be', 'rock', 'stars', 'seventies', 'wished', 'had', 'exuding', 'kind', 'charm', 'hearts', 'Russell', 'Hammond', 'guitarist', 'band', 'Penny', 'true', 'love', 'Patrick', 'Fugit', 'William', 'Miller', 'would', 'be', 'teenaged', 'writer', 'hero', 'who', 'charming', 'boyish', 'vulnerable', 'well', 'heroic', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'mother', 'just', 'right', 'combination', 'pigheaded', 'earnestness', 'unique', 'sense', 'comedic.The', 'entire', 'cast', 'was', 'terrific', 'characters', 'were', 'truly', 'original', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winning', 'script', 'was', 'clever', 'times', 'profound', 'interspersed', 'sparkling', 'lines', 'My', 'favorite', 'Lester', 'Bangs', 'William', 'school', 'mates', 'quot', ""'ll"", 'meet', 'again', 'long', 'journey', 'middle.', 'quot', 'Also', 'important', 'Crowe', 'paid', 'close', 'attention', 'detail', 'never', 'lost', 'concentration', 'Everything', 'seemed', 'amazingly', 'authentic', 'right', 'down', 'floral', 'stitch', 'Russell', 'shirts', 'bottles', 'Jack', 'Daniels', 'hands', 'nothing', 'was', 'done', 'routine', 'manner', 'scene', 'was', 'carefully', 'planned', 'even', 'minor', 'characters', 'were', 'roundly', 'developed', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'particular', 'Lester', 'Bangs', 'mentor', 'cynical', 'rock', 'critic', 'brought', 'life', 'fine', 'performance', 'Phillip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'William', 'sweet', 'slightly', 'dippy', 'sister', 'vividly', 'portrayed', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'Notice', 'how', 'Crowe', 'even', 'took', 'trouble', 'satirize', 'flight', 'attendants', 'parody', 'stewardess', 'uniforms', 'day', 'glow', 'orange', '.Yes', 'loved', 'film', 'predict', 'Academy', 'members', 'obviously', 'did', 'not', 'really', 'SEE', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'rewarding', 'producers', 'sometime', 'down', 'road', 'oversight']",Almost Famous

The movie has a lot to say about this particular period in our country's history, taking us back in time to a place where happiness was achieved not solely through drugs and sexual practice, but also through bringing entertainment and joy into peoples' lives through music. The movie has a lot of sparkle and comedy to it, which makes it shine like no other film of this genre since &quot;Forrest Gump.&quot;The story is based on actual events of director Cameron Crowe's life, his interactions with a band just getting to know itself, and his own self-discovery as he becomes involved in more than he bargained for. The protagonist surrounded by all of this is William Miller, who lives with his mother and sister in San Diego. He was put in the first grade at the age of five, which makes him a senior at the age of fifteen. Without a father, his mother has become a control freak, dominating every aspect of her childrens' lives until his sister cannot take it anymore and leaves. This sets up the coming stages of William's life: he finds his sister's collection of record albums, which his mother describes as &quot;the poetry of drugs and promiscuous sex,&quot; at which point the movie shoots ahead to his fifteenth year.His introduction to the head of &quot;Creem&quot; magazine leads him to new heights: he is given an assigment to write a column about Black Sabbath, leading him to meet the band Stillwater as well as Penny Lane, part of a group of girls known as the Band Aids, who are basically groupies without that particular title. At this point in the film, William's character is seen in many different lights: he's vulnerable to the many degrading aspects that come along with the rock-n-role lifestyle, yet he is completely entranced by finally getting out and into the mix of it all, especially so close to the real action. Crowe is magnificent in bringing out his childish wonderment and awe, which will serve as the higher power for the rest of the film.After receiving a call from Rolling Stone magazine, William is given the opportunity to travel across the country with the band in order to write a full-length article on them. His experiences with the band and their followers provide us with an in-depth look at the music as well as the complications and arguments that arise from its creation. The band brinks on falling apart at various points throughout the film, and it's interesting to see all of this play out onscreen. William is thrown into a mix of things he has never experienced: drugs, sex, music, parties, screaming fans, to mention a few. He never does any drugs, but his resistance to them sets him apart from the rest of the crowd, and his struggle to fit in with everyone becomes hindered.From his first interactions with Penny Lane (which, by the way, is not her real name), he develops a deep interest in her, even though the feeling is not completely mutual. Penny is involved with Russell Hammond, the member of the band most focused on by William as well as the movie, and her relationship with him goes against everything she claims that the Band Aids stand for (&quot;Groupies sleep with rock stars because they want to be near someone famous. We're here because of the music&quot;).And that's what the movie is really all about: showing us that people are not what they say they are, or what they appear to be. Everyone in this movie has, beneath their thin veneer, has a deeper human feeling, or something that they haven't shared right away. The band's discord is one such example of this: they have problems with Russell, who they think is taking away from their fame, and their proclamation that they care more for satisfying their fans is countered by these very arguments. Penny and Russell's relationship will reveal something much fuller about both of their characters, as they come to terms with what they have experienced and what they really want in life.William's character is the most complex out of the group. His journey from a protective mother to the wilds and thrills of the rock scene becomes an engaging trip for the audience. His devotion to writing his article soon becomes less important, trading this plot point for William's coming-of-age in the midst of a revolution in musical history. He still retains his values and moral beliefs, and he even picks up new ones along the way.Everything about this movie is fun and entertaining. It's got lots of elements at work in it: there's lots of loud music that has meaning, there's a human story behind that music, there's a little bit of romance, themes about friendship, loyalty and trust... do I need to go on? Everything here comes to life in this movie, whether it be the bright and airy attitudes embodied in the characters, or the delightful costumes and set pieces that bring the beginning of the 70's to life in vivid detail. There are bursts of comedy and deep thought that combine in bringing this era to life as well, keeping the movie entertaining and meaningful all at the same time.Crowe also employs one of the best ensemble casts of 2000. Billy Crudup plays Russell Hammond deeply and with emotion, while Kate Hudson supplies cheeriness and bright wonderment to the movie. Frances McDormand is a nicely rendered controlling mother, while Philip Seymour Hoffman plays the voice of advice for William, who is portrayed exquisitely by newcomer Patrick Fugit. This is a dynamic collection of acting talent from all arenas, bringing a diversity and nostalgia to the movie that keeps it alive and frivolous.&quot;Almost Famous&quot; bubbles over with the sheer joy and happiness that the era was filled with, and it succeeds in bringing that joy to life. It tells an involving story about a boy who sees more than most were ever able to, giving us a unique view of a unique group of people. Its ideas are in the right place, as are its messages and elements. I felt a great sense of exhilaration in watching this movie; it has a little magic in it for everyone to share.",4,A well done film!,987465600,"04 17, 2001",2001,6447,"['am', 'quite', 'partial',

And Cameron Crowe's semi-autobiographical ALMOST FAMOUS captures this extraordinary time, when rock bands and their groupies explored communal love and carnal desires in tour buses and flea-bitten motels.  This film is a coming of age tale for 15-year-old William Miller (Patrick Fugit), a talented teen who gets a once-in-a-lifetime gig from 'Rolling Stone' magazine to cover the up-and-coming band Stillwater as the group embarks on a national tour.  Stillwater is led by lead guitarist Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup is sensational), a mega-diva who feels his considerable talents are wasted with his bandmates, and who keeps putting off interviews with the hero-worshipping William.  Yet the band is smart enough to allow William into their midst to befriend him--a strategy the members hope will result in a glowing article; and this midst includes the traveling groupies, including Russell's favorite, Penny Lane (Kate Hudson).  William becomes smitten with this flower child, and accordingly, comes to resent Russell's callous treatment of her.The interactions of the band, their fans, and William's eye-popping observations of all that transpire, are as believable as they are hysterical.  And during this journey, William is mentored by a cynical publisher (Philip Seymour Hoffman gives a terrific performance) and his progressive, yet overbearing mother (Frances McDormand ain't bad, either).  Over the course of three breathless weeks, William experiences love, euphoria, disappointment, and angst; for this teen, it's a life-altering experience.  Yet for Stillwater--in particular, Russell Hammond--their lives are forever altered, too.  And this tour causes Penny to do some serious soul searching of her own.  The music is terrific, the interactions totally credible, and the comedy flaunts a distinct, hard edge.  If you never got to experience the Seventies, ALMOST FAMOUS is one of the best ways to see for yourself how we old geezers used to get our grooves on.--D.

An overwhelming charm seeps from every frame of this movie, every character, every moment, making it impossible for me to imagine that Cameron Crowe ever had doubts about bringing this story to life.If you enjoyed the strengths of Almost Famous, I think the &quot;bootleg/Untitled&quot; cut of this movie will only make the movie better for you. It is essentially a more detailed, slightly slower-paced, but richer version of the movie, where the magic moments take more time to unfold, the sense of reality is more firmly established, and the characters are better explored. Billy Crudup and Jason Lee are absolutely wonderful as the feuding vocalist/guitarist team; Patrick Fugit brings much innocent charm and emotional honesty; Philip Seymour Hoffman, Fairuza Balk, Zooey Deschanel, Noah Taylor and Frances McDormand are all sublime; and of course, Kate Hudson steals the show as one of the most adorable characters I've ever seen, a combination of naive sensuality, sheer joie de vivre, and romantic longing. Crowe richly deserved his Best Screenplay Oscar, as well -- this movie contains magic moments aplenty, and the dialogue shifts effortlessly from the gloriously funny to the achingly heartfelt.The bonus materials are abundant -- this is more than just a bootleg, it's a veritable boxed set. A Stillwater music CD, an interview with Lester Bangs, outtakes (including one patience-testing, but still amusing sequence shot of Penny Lane -- smart not to include in either version of the movie), transcripts of Crowe's original Rolling Stone articles -- in a year of great DVD releases, this one stands on its own, even among Criterion's Hitchcock releases, the Godfather DVD set, and the second season of The Sopranos.Cameron Crowe's love of music has translated into cinematic form.

528910,A3UAVYY80HNFZW,B00003CXMG,drefractor,"[2, 2]","Almost Famous is a near note-perfect recreation of the rock music millieu before it had exhausted itself in excess in the middle to later 70's. Director Cameron Crowe weaves heavy doses of his personal experiences into a fictional tale of how a hard working band, Stillwater, rises to stardom aided by all sorts of willing dreamers.The interactions between the band members and all of the people whose lives they touch are simply mezmerizing. Especially interesting is the examination of the range of participation that people have with music. Crowe differentiates in many shades between the casual and the romantic aspects of music: On the casual side we see music as a business -- its creators and fans as product to be sold or reported on, to be seen with or to have casual relationships with; On the romantic side we see music as a revelation unto itself -- it generates love to be shared between people.The characters and actors (great casting!) are all believable and, in the end, inspiring. The sex and drugs aspects are sanitized a bit, but then this is a love story with a relatively happy ending, not a tale of failed music.Some of the lighter fun includes all sorts of visual and spoken references to many of the premier performers of the early seventies: Bowie, Sabbath, The Who, Led Zep, Elton John, Allman Brothers, Joni Mitchell, Lou Reed and a blur of others...If you like the theatrical version and are interested in the autobiographical aspects in more detail, I highly recommend the director's cut. The mother-son relationship that seems somewhat implausable in the film was apparently right on the money, and Cameron Crowe did in fact skip 3 grades (one skip instigated by a simple mistake!) and graduated high school at the age of 15. The near airplane crash, the Lester Bangs relationship, the sister who leaves Cameron with her music collection and her wisdom and then meets him sitting alone in an airport -- all true!Another interesting note from the director's cut is that Cameron is married to Nancy Wilson of Heart and they co-wrote the fictional Stillwater band's songs and she wrote other parts of the soundtrack as well. Cameron also comments on several reactions to Almost Famous from bands or individuals that were included on the excellent soundtrack of the movie.Finally, In addition to the autobiographical richness, the director's cut adds insightful personal and relational depth to virutually every major character in the movie.Unless you really dislike the aforementioned musical sources, I recommend you take a look at this movie as a cultural historical document, if nothing else.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[4, 4]","As I was born in the 1980s, I can only check out the era of blossoming rock'n'roll (Rolling Stones, the Doors, the Beatles, Led Zeppelin) through books and movies. ""Almost Famous,"" a semi-autobiographical movie about the 1970s rock scene, gives a glimpse of the life of a young reporter (based on Crowe himself). A must-see for music fans!When William's sister (Zooey Deschanel) left home, she gave him her collection of records: the Who, Cream, Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, and many others. When William (Patrick Fugit) is fifteen he manages to get a writing assignment with Creem, and then with Rolling Stone magazine to write about the rising rock band Stillwater (think a mixture of the Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin). William falls in with the Stillwater guys and their circle of adoring groupies, including an effervescent blonde, Penny Lane (Kate Hudson).Despite the displeasure of his controlling but loving mom (she claims adolescence is a marketing ploy), William accompanies Stillwater across the country. He keeps trying to get an interview with guitarist Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup), but Russell is too busy partying with Penny and diving off rooftops (literally) to give William his material. But some alarming incidents show William that the drugs, sex and rock'n'roll are only a veneer for what really matters.""Almost Famous"" is a fantastic mixture of expose and tribute -- there's music, there's romance, there's comedy. There isn't a lot of pratfall humor, although there is some (Anna Paquin running smack into a cement wall); the scene on the airplane where everyone confesses their sins is fantastic (Ed's only line is hysterically anticlimactic). We get to see inter-band conflict (who's the star?), groupies, rock journalism, and the unfortunate aftereffects for groupies. Yet the sort-of-romance between Penny and William is very sweet, rooted in genuine affection.Both the glamour and the grit is shown here. The dialogue sparkles (""Last words: I dig music... I'M ON DRUGS!"", ""Forgive me Father, for I may sin tonight,"" ""I'm about to boldly go where... many men have gone before""), and the direction is superb -- it cuts forward just when it needs to; the camera follows people out onto the dizzying stage and then zooms in for intimate close-ups. Nowhere else could a stomach-pumping scene actually contain an element of romance.Patrick Fugit is a surprisingly solid lead, with a sort of wide-eyed innocence that contrasts sharply with everyone else. Kate Hudson plays a sweet groupie who doesn't practice what she preaches (""Never take it seriously, you never get hurt."") and falls in love with Russell -- only to get tossed away. Her fragile ""why doesn't he love me?"" is one of the best lines in the movie.

Along the way, he makes friends and falls in love.  Miller, played so perfectly and brilliantly by Patrick Fugit, wants to be a rock journalist much to the chagrin of his mother.  Frances Mcdormand plays his overbearing, overprotective mother, and every scene she is in cracks me up.  She was also excellent in this movie, and definitely deserves her Oscar nomination.  Speaking of Oscar, Kate Hudson, who is also nominated in the same category, Best Supporting Actress, is also great in the movie.  She plays Penny Lane, a groupie..excuse me, &quot;Band aid&quot;, she says she is just a big fan of the music and wants to be around the band.  She would rather be around famous people cuz they are more interesting.  William gets his first professional gig as a writer for Rolling Stone.  He is to go on the road with a band and write a fantastic article about his journey with the band Stillwater.Does he ever get his whole story amidst the drugs, sex, and rock and roll?  You will have to watch this movie to find out.I am a huge fan of alot of the bands used in the movies soundtrack, which is awesome by the way.  There are a few songs you won't recognize, but you will know who's singing.  It is said that this film is a semi-autobiograpical account of Cameron Crowe's early days, before his career took off.He is both the director and writer of the movie.  The band Stillwater is a composite of the bands, yes there was more than one, that Crowe went on the road with.  This maybe not be the classic 70's film that Dazed and Confused is, but it is pretty darn close if you ask me.  I actually originally wanted to see this movie because Billy Crudup, who I admire as an actor and just like to look at, was in it.  I also wanted to see it because it was the latest Cameron Crowe flick as I have loved most of the films he has done: Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Say Anything, Singles.. I consider &quot;Almost Famous&quot; to be one of the best films of the year 2000.  It had a very endearing quality(especially to those who grew up in the 70s and loved the rock and roll that came out of it) and some of the best performances of the year.

This utopia where dreams in fact can and do come true, where if you just have some guts and some brawn and go with your heart, the road may lead to a different path than you first intended, where music placed in the most perfect of scenes can transport you to a time of endless love and karma and you can, if only for an hour or two, wonder why the world can be so cruel and unkind. Kate Hudson is radiant. I fell in love with Penny Lane. I wanted to run my fingers through her hair, let her cry on my shoulders, sing to her. I feel in love with Billy Crudup, his passion for music ignited another fire in me that was brewing for some time: to get out and see the small things that perhaps in the day to day heydey of living, I take for granted.

In the beginning, you meet his overbearing but well meaning mother, who surprisingly enough allows him to tour with Stillwater.  Frances McDormand steals several sceens with her wonderful acting.  Miller meets his favorite rock critic, Lester Bangs, and Bangs has Miller writing for Bangs's magazine, Creem.  The next thing Miller knows, Rolling Stone wants him to write for them!  That's how Miller ends up on the road with Stillwater and the wonderful Penny Lane (Kate Hudson).This movie is multi-faceted, has well developed characters and never gets bogged down in useless drivel.  I own both the VHS and DVD versions, and the DVD is definitely the one to own.  The uncut version is better than the original, and the extra material fills in a few very small gaps in the movie.  Also, with the DVD, you get both versions anyway.Plus, the music!

Cameron Crowe perfectly captures the entire essence of that not-really -too-long -ago-but-a-lifetime-ago-time. Yes, if you were there (circa early 1970's), this movie will totally fulfill any nostalgic yearnings. It brought back faces & places I hadn't thought about in 30 years. Those fabulous, jewel-bedecked, feathered creatures, standing off to the side of the stage, while Alice Cooper or Black Sabbath blew our minds at ear-splitting volume, I always wondered (and envied) what their lives were like. HOW did THEY get in?? (God, I was dumb.) And even if you weren't(there), the performances are all SO great, that this is the closest you can come to ""being there."" You WILL smell patchouli! Yes, I, like many, very much identify with the un-cool, rock star worshipping 15 year old, ""William"". (I even had that same awful, swept over, un-hair-do!) And was just as naive. We ALL wanted to hit the road, & follow around our favorite band, & this movie ALMOST fulfills that un-fulfilled desire. But it's about so much more. It is also a beautiful coming of age story. I had never seen Kate Hudson before, but from the moment she enters her first scene, you'll be enamored of her beauty, screen prescence, and obvious intelligence beyond her years. I deplore hype, but everything they've said about this actress is true (for once). Her ""Penny Lane"" is much more then a groupie. Really, all the players in this film are great, and there's not a wasted moment. That director Crowe based William on himself is obvious & now well known. How perfect that, in ""real"" life, he got his own rock goddess, in marrying Nancy Wilson, of the fabulous ""Heart"". Dreams really can come true. I haven't seen the un-issued version, but, after reading the reviews of those who have, I plan to. There's really so much to say about this great film, so, just SEE it. I suspect those few who REALLY disliked this film probably went into it with a bug up their...! Ignore them, they have no taste, & probably dress badly.

528921,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00003CXMG,"""flickjunkie""","[0, 0]","Writer/Director Cameron Crowe (""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"", ""Jerry Maguire"") has a knack for capturing the human condition in all its imperfect glory.  He is particularly insightful when he is writing from his own experiences.  To write ""Fast Times"", he went undercover at a high school posing as a student.  The result was an honest and genuine high school flick that was too real to be fiction.  He does the same with this film, drawing on his experience as a writer for Rolling Stone Magazine when he toured with Led Zeppelin at age 16.  Though the band and the most of the people in this film are fictitious, many of the situations are based on real events and the characters are composites of real people.Some people have compared this film to ""This is Spinal Tap"", but other than the fact that it follows a rock group, there is little similarity.  ""Tap"" was a spoof documentary with its tongue firmly in cheek.  AF is raw and real with a believable plot (except perhaps the silly airplane confession scene) and affecting characters.  Crowe went to great lengths to capture the rock scene precisely, sending the actors to band camp to get them to the point where they could actually perform.  Stillwater is literally a rock band created out of actors.  While some of the vocals are dubbed, Jason Lee really sings lead on a couple of tracks, and Billy Crudup and the band are actually playing.  Crowe was quoted as saying it was a pity that the band had to break up after the film was produced, because they were actually a pretty good band.  Nancy Wilson and Peter Frampton wrote most of the band's original music to give the songs an authentic sound.Crowe's direction is excellent.  Though the pacing of the film is a bit uneven, dragging at times, his ability to depict the feelings of the time through the performances of the actors is superb.  The sound track is rich in 1970's music that is enhanced by the use of the DTS format on the DVD.  The DVD also has numerous fascinating behind-the-scenes segments, including a copy of the original articles written by Crowe when he wrote for Rolling Stone Magazine.The acting by the ensemble cast is outstanding.  In keeping with the theme of the film, most of the actors are bright young talents who are almost famous.  Billy Crudup is the closest thing to a leading role actor, having starred in a few good but minor films (""Without Limits"", ""Waking the Dead"").  Crudup's performance as the self-absorbed and brilliant guitarist who holds the band together is first rate.  Frances McDormand is fabulous as always as William's oppressive mother.In a cast replete with fine performances, Kate Hudson stands out, giving a brilliant presentation of Penny Lane.  She brings enormous emotional power to a very demanding role that ranges from effervescent to suicidal.  Newcomer Patrick Fugit finds the right balance between nerdy and wise as William.  Jason Lee is wonderfully turbulent as the temperamental lead singer.This film is a winner.  By capturing the emotions rather than just a series of rock events, it takes us behind the scenes of the rock revolution in a way that no documentary ever has.  I rated it a 9/10.

I wanted more.What I didn't expect was how very the new material (typically extended scenes though there are a few new scenes as well) changed the tone and feel of this film. Penny Lane comes across as a tragic, lost soul. Stillwater comes across as a bunch of debauched, spoiled, poorly educated, brain challenged musicians. The &quot;suits&quot; - including the Rolling Stone &quot;hippy suits&quot; - come across as sharks. William Miller comes across as a well intentioned but naive quick learner. He seems vulnerable.  Alot of the ackward mysteries of the theatrical release (How did Lester Bangs and William end up at a pizza joint after they had just said good-bye?  Why did Russell deny everything after encouraging William to write what he wanted to?  What held Stillwater together after those shocking confessions on the plane? There are many other examples.)It almost like a different film!  In fact, a BETTER film I would have to say.Further, based on my experience in the music industry I found this director's cut to be more reality than fantasy -- the inverse was true of the theatrical release from my perspective. It's STILL not at a &quot;documentary&quot; level but, hey, this isn't suppose to be a horror flick is it?Also, I know it's kind of whacky (maybe I'm a brain challenged musician too) but I really dig Stillwater's music.  I have been listening to the Stillwater CD that comes in the package since I got it.  I agree with Cameron Crowe, if these guys toured I would go see them!

I found it in the five-dollar  bin at a nearby Wal-Mart. It was well worth the cost. Good movie. I've been a Rock 'n' Roll ever since the genre came into existence in the mid-fifties. Plus, for me, that was just about the time of leaving the nest. This story is a multi-layered account of a family where the children are in the process of leaving the nest. First to go is the young daughter who becomes a flight attendant.The second departure is by the young son who is interested in being a Rock and Roll reporter. It's a coming of age  time and the main story concerns the son who gets tied up with a tour of Stillwater, a rising band in need of good press. Of course there are Band Aides (most of us would call them Groupies) and it's party, party, party with the son's nervous and protective mother following every move, albeit at a distance. It's a fun story, and very well put  together. If you've ever wondered what it might be like to be on the inside of a rock 'n' roll tour, well, this is probably as close as most of you will ever get.The movie is well put together.  It seems overly long, but I can't recognize anything that needs to be cut. The photography is excellent. The soundtrack is a wonderful rock and roll collage that would fall into the ""oldies but goodies"" category. The flow of the story is quite good. The acting is well done and I especially appreciated Kate Hudson, one of the tender young Band Aides. It's a fun and uplifting movie. If you like rock and roll, you should love this one.

528925,A1RJJ56MBJMX87,B00003CXMG,Gavin Wilson,"[11, 12]","This movie is about what it was like to be a fan of 70s album music, albeit from the privileged viewpoint of a teenage journalist who had access to rock groups that most of us could only dream about.  Though I didn't see the movie in a cinema, I'm one of the fans who has gone a bundle with its release on video, buying both the DVD and the soundtrack CD.  Though there are already 268+ reviews of the DVD on this site, I feel I just have to say how much I too love it.What I love about the movie, besides its gentle humour, its superb choice of music and uplifting theme, is that the characters are so fully rendered that there is so much going on in each scene.  Take the moment where guitarist Russell first speaks to William's Mum on the phone -- though the key to the scene is that she manages to freak even him out, writer/director Crowe still finds space in the same moment for Penny Lane to fend off another groupie making herself too available to Russell.I also like the fact that the plot contains no bad guy or violence.  Though in the UK the DVD carries a '15' rating -- for the use of expletives -- I'm happy to let my ten-year-old daughter watch it with me.  (I'm using it mainly as a covert means of getting her to appreciate the 70s music that I enjoy so much!)Despite the fact that there's no bad guy and the superficial resemblance of the film to a road movie, we shouldn't allow our senses to be beguiled into ignoring the clever plot structuring, which is still based on the Hero's Quest map used for 'Star Wars', 'Lion King' etc.  Lester Bangs makes an excellent mentor in this movie -- far more wisdom spews from his lips than say, William's Mum's.  Setting the climax in an aircraft poised on the brink of crashing in an electrical storm was a brilliant stroke.The choice of songs for the movie was excellent. Camercon Crowe chose the high-quality album tracks of the period, rather than the dance-oriented oldies that most nostalgia movies go for. 1972-76 is the period in rock that I ought to know best, but there are several songs here, such as 'Tiny Dancer', 'Mr Farmer' and 'Every Picture Tells a Story', which I hadn't heard before. Even the Cat Stevens' track ('The Wind') was a revelation which has considerably increased the respect I have for the artist.  My appreciation of Led Zep's acoustic numbers and even Simon &amp; Garfunkel has also improved as a result of Crowe's highly intelligent juxtaposition of sound and vision. But I still loathe Rod Stewart!But the soundtrack sound quality is so good that I'm half-convinced that Crowe re-re-mastered many of the tracks specially for the movie.Much of today's expletive-loaded music seems to do nothing but encourage violence and bring out the worse in people.  (There I go sounding like William's Mum!) The late 60s and early 70s was a time when music tried to elevate our senses.  Many thanks, Cameron, for making this excellent tribute to the period.

I'd heard about ""Almost Famous"", that it was a rock'n'roll kind of film, but the moment I found out it was set in the 1970s, I kept my eye out for the DVDs. Being born in the 1980s, I can't say whether this was an accurate potrait of the music scene back then, but I certainly found it interesting.William Miller (Patrick Fugit) is a clever kid, so clever he's been skipped ahead two grades. He likes to write, it seems, and he loves rock music and the scene that surrounds it. He wants to become a rock journalist, so he finds a local writer, who gives him a few pointers, and his first job - to write an article. William writes his article, and it goes down really well. So well, in fact, that Rolling Stone magazine give him a call, asking him to go along with Stillwater on the road on their ""Almost Famous"" tour. He's underage, and has lots of exams to do at school, but with a deep voice over the phone and the help of a ""band-aid"" by the name of Penny Lane (Kate Hudson), he is off around America with the rock group. On the tour he sees the ups, the downs, the dirty and the cleaned up. He falls in love, learns a lot about himself and hears a little more than a music journalist is supposed to. To top it all off, his concerned mother keeps ringing around, trying to get him to come home!It's an intriguing, involving ride, I thought. You get to see the perspective of a 1970s band, a worried 1970s parent, a 1970s fan, and a 1970s groupie. That's a lot of points of view, and they're all handled thoughtfully, I thought. I like the look of the sets and the locations. The young extras are a nice touch too. The music playing in the background really helped set the scene, I felt. Led Zeppelin, The Who, Simon & Garfunkel, plus a song from a couple of my favorite 1970s groups like Jethro Tull and Yes.

When I finally rented it last weekend, I was quite dissapointed.  The fifteen year old genius seems out of place on the road with the fictitious band Stillwater.  This fifteen year old does not even have any passion for rock n roll music.  He is just a good writer who happens to be underaged.  The only reason he was into music was because his sister left him a handful of records.The comments about the rock n roll era being on its death bed and that Cameron Crowe arrived just in time for the death rattle is ludicrous.  1973 was the golden age of rock n roll as many styles of music were still considered cool.The road trip scenes were pretty interesting and the presence of the groupies seemed like they were depicted fairly accurately.

Over the years, William (Patrick Fugit) develops an interest and befriends legendary music critic Lester Bangs (Philip Seymour Hoffman: Flawless, Magnolia, The Talented Mr. Ripley), who asks him to cover a Black Sabbath concert for ""Creem"" magazine. His article earns the mature-sounding 15-year-old an assignment from Rolling Stone magazine to join the more accessible ""Stillwater"" band and interview lead guitarist Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup) and lead singer~~ Jeff Bebe (Jason Lee) during their ""Almost Famous"" concert tour. Postponing his obligations at school and at home, William develops emotional ties with the band and with the coquettish groupie Penny Lane (Kate Hudson), and discovers the contradictions of being a subjective journalist.Almost Famous constructs its plot with effective time constraints which create suspense and establish the film's sense of humor. This is explored within the arena of William's responsibilities toward his~~ editor (who thinks the writer he has hired over the phone is much older) and his mother (who wishes her boy is mature enough to resist peer pressure and drugs, but young enough to obey her). Both the editor and the mother, who require that William constantly check back with them and who impose deadlines (to submit the article outline or to return home), communicate with the protagonist via the phone throughout most of the film. Still, rather than interrupt the boy's tour/trip with the band, the~~ editor/mother interludes emphasize the main character's inability to escape from duty. The comedy rises from William's efforts to be seen as a free adult --a status the band members claim to have reached-- while he struggles with his evident inexperience. Never quite reaching a dramatic point, Almost Famous maintains a comfortable level of seriousness as it explores the main character's doubts and decisions in relation to his role as ""The Enemy"", or the critic who ""writes what he sees.""~~ Not letting his perceptions be influenced by the illusion of friendship, nor letting them deny the validity of his subjective reality, the protagonist finds freedom in those attempts that ""almost"" fail or ""almost succeed"". In this sense, Almost Famous finds a temperate --almost happy-- middle ground in its treatment of such commonly temperamental issues as sex, drugs and rock'n'roll.~",5,Almost Famous Shines!,1005696000,"11 14, 2001",2001,2863,"['~This', 'got', 'be', 'BEST', 'film', 'have', 'senn', 'time', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'Penny', 'Lane', 'literally', 'shines', 'scene.Set', 'San', 'Diego', 'early', '1970s', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'subtly', 'element', 'rock', ""n'roll"", 'music', 'venue', 'freedom', 'Finding', 'moral', 'support', 'lyrics', 'Simon', 'Garfunkel', '18-year-old', 'Anita', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'rebels', 'conservative', 'mother', 'Elaine', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'Deciding', 'leave', 'home', 'younger', 'brother', 'William', 'let', 'be', 'influenced~~', 'music', 'era', 'years', 'William', 'Patrick', 'Fugit', 'interest', 'legendary', 'music', 'critic', 'Lester', 'Bangs', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'Flawless', 'Magnolia', 'Talented', 'Mr.', 'Ripley', 'who', 'cover', 'Black', 'Sabbath', 'concert', 'Creem', 'magazine', 'article', 'mature-sounding', '15-year-old', 'assignment', 'Rolling', 'Stone', 'magazine', 'join', 'more', 'accessible', 'Stillwater', 'band', 'interview', 'lead', 'guitarist', 'Russell', 'Hammond', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'lead', 'singer~~', 'Jeff', 'Bebe', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'concert', 'tour', 'Postponing', 'obligations', 'school', 'home', 'William', 'emotional', 'ties', 'band', 'coquettish', 'groupie', 'Penny', 'Lane', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'contradictions', 'being', 'subjective', 'journalist.Almost', 'Famous', 'plot', 'effective', 'time', 'constraints', 'create', 'suspense', 'establish', 'film', 'sense', 'humor', 'explored', 'arena', 'William', 'responsibilities', 'his~~', 'editor', 'who', 'writer', 'hired', 'phone', 'much', 'older', 'mother', 'who', 'boy', 'mature', 'enough', 'resist', 'peer', 'pressure', 'drugs', 'young', 'enough', 'obey', 'editor', 'mother', 'who', 'require', 'William', 'constantly', 'back', 'who', 'impose', 'deadlines', 'submit', 'article', 'outline', 'return', 'home', 'communicate', 'protagonist', 'phone', 'most', 'film', 'Still', 'rather', 'interrupt', 'boy', 'tour/trip', 'band', 'the~~', 'editor/mother', 'interludes', 'emphasize', 'main', 'character', 'inability', 'escape', 'duty', 'comedy', 'William', 'efforts', 'be', 'seen', 'free', 'adult', 'status', 'band', 'members', 'claim', 'have', 'reached', 'evident', 'inexperience', 'Never', 'quite', 'reaching', 'dramatic', 'point', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'comfortable', 'level', 'seriousness', 'main', 'character', 'doubts', 'decisions', 'relation', 'role', 'Enemy', 'critic', 'who', 'what', '~~', 'Not', 'letting', 'perceptions', 'be', 'influenced', 'illusion', 'friendship', 'letting', 'deny', 'validity', 'subjective', 'reality', 'protagonist', 'freedom', 'attempts', 'almost', 'fail', 'almost', 'succeed', 'sense', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'temperate', 'almost', 'happy', 'middle', 'ground', 'treatment', 'such', 'commonly', 'temperamental', 'issues', 'sex', 'drugs', 'rock', ""n'roll.~""]",Almost Famous

Billy Crudup and Kate Hudson shine as the young, innocent and passionate teen couple who is discovering life through music and must face a new and complex world that forces them to make hard choices. &quot;Almost Famous&quot; is clearly a labour of love, since everyone seems to be enjoying what they`re doing, and the fact that some elements are based on Cameron Crowe`s experiences also helps.

The character that Crowe based on himself is William Miller (well played by Patrick Fugit). A reporter for his high school newspaper, the unpopular William dreams of writing for a rock and roll publication. He gets his big chance when he meets his idol, rock reporter Lester Bangs (Phillip Seymour Hoffman, in a great supporting role). Bangs tells William to write an interview for Cream Magazine.  That interview (with Black Sabbath) does not happen, but he meets the opening act, Stillwater.  Soon, Wlliam finds himself on the road with Stillwater, with an assignment to write an article about  them for Rolling Stone.  William is befriended by groupie Penny Lane (Kate Hudson, who deservedly won a Golden Globe and an Oscar nomination), whose boyfriend is the band's lead guitarist (Billy Crudup). What follows is William's sometimes funny and sometimes painful experiences with life on the road. He becomes friends with the band and falls in love with Penny, all while trying to write an objective article for the magazine. It is hard for him to stay objective about his new friends. As Lester observes:&quot;They made you feel cool. And I've met you. You are not cool.&quot;  These situations are all observed with a lot of heart and soul in Cameron Crowe's Oscar winning script.  Frances McDormand adds just the right touch as William's mother, who doesn't understand her son's dreams, but wants to be supportive anyway.  The &quot;bootleg&quot; edition DVD is loaded with lots of REALLY COOL extras. The first disc includes a director's cut with 35 extra minutes, including a birthday party scene for Penny, among others. The second disc includes the original film. The package also gives you commentary by Crowe and his mother Alice; behind-the-scenes foootage; unseen Stillwater concert footage; the original shooting script; an interview with Bangs from 1973; Crowe's top 10 albums of 1973; reprints of Crowe's articles for Rolling Stone; even a six track CD of Stillwater's songs. Only &quot;Fever Dog&quot; appears on both this CD and the soundtrack album. All the songs on the bonus CD are great. &quot;Almost Famous&quot; is one of my favorite movies in recent years.

Hopefully she'll get more dramatic parts, but I have a feeling this will be the crowning gem in her career.  She's absolutely luminous, and has you alternately saddened and infatuated at various times throughout the movie.Frances McDormand is also stellar in her supporting role; she gets the biggest laughs.

I probably won't be able to back the statement up in a few sentences.  You will have to watch Almost Famous to see for yourself.Cameron Crowe has always been my favorite movie writer/director.  Say Anything.  Singles.  Jerry Maguire.  And now, Almost Famous.  Crowe has an amazing ability to give his characters down to earth personalities.  From the way they give their lines to the expressions on their faces, it is as if the actors in Crowe's films go to &quot;The Cameron Crowe School for Acting&quot; before filming.  What makes this aspect of his films interesting for me is that each film is very different from the last, even though they are similar on many levels.Kate Hudson, Bully Crudup, Patrick Fugit and all the actors were perfectly cast.  Kate Hudson seems to be a natural.  She handled the character of Penny Lane like a pro.  Her facial expressions, the ways she moved and positioned her hands, and her laugh, made Penny Lane seem like an innocent yet mysterious and experienced groupie.I would like to give special props to Fairuza Balk.  Even though the part was small, Fairuza's Sapphire was a great addition to the film.  I love the scene in which William's Mother called the hotel and Sapphire spoke of what a great boy William was.  Fairuza seems like an old soul, perfect to play a groupie from the 70's.  She reminds me of my Mother's old hippy friends from when I was a kid.The soundtrack...PERFECT.

528951,A28ERDII8FZQQ9,B00003CXMG,J. Daniel,"[4, 4]","If you look closely, you can see the arc of Cameron Crowe's films as they mirror his own journey from precocious adolescent (FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH, SAY ANYTHING, SINGLES) to successful professional (JERRY MAGUIRE), with music always marking the trail he has taken. Now a successful 40-something, Crowe does what we all do at that stage. He looks backwards, with longing. And so, in ALMOST FAMOUS, he offers us a loving reflection on his youth and the music that lit the way. With this picture, Crowe does the impossible. he makes us nostalgic for the 70s. Somehow, thanks to Crowe, the era has taken on that burnished glow that only memory can endow.Crowe starts his film with credits... not an unusual technique. Except these credits are being written in pencil on a yellow note pad by a disembodied hand. The hand writes out each name, even misspelling `Frances McDormand' then erasing the error and fixing it. The credits have not even finished and I already love this movie. This in not some generic, Hollywood story, measured and sliced with a cookie-cutter called `market research.' This is a personal story being told by somebody. And a young somebody, to boot. inexperienced, but gamely writing as fast as he can, fixing his mistakes along the way. If the credits are this good, what will the movie be like, I wonder.Crowe was a teenager who wrote Rock criticism for Rolling Stone magazine in the 70s, before his FAST TIMES adventure. It is that period of his life that provides the basis for the movie's plot.Cast as the young Crowe is Patrick Fugit. He is Crowe as a decent, nerdy, talented boy (called William), who is barely surviving his loving, overbearing mother. As mom, Frances McDormand is simultaneously unnerving and endearing in her Oscar nominated performance. William's loving but irritating big sister clashes with mom and sis takes off with her boyfriend to become a stewardess. In an effort to save him from mom's influence, sis leaves behind her record collection. That pile of vinyl opens up a whole new universe for William. He is an `un-cool' high school kid, isolated and in pain, father-less, sister-less. but Rock n Roll becomes his world and his salvation.William becomes a writer, precociously penning music criticism for local papers. He is befriended by the burned-out editor of Creem Magazine, Lester Bangs, brilliantly played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Hoffman creates a curmudgeonly mentor for William, a sort of ghost of Christmas-yet-to-be, ranting that `Rock is dead' and providing other such heartening insights, while also giving him a willing ear and an encouraging word. Though based on an actual figure, Hoffman's Les Bangs is an original film creation. a Rock prophet-guru-nerd who, seeing his end in sight as he slouches toward Bethlehem, can't help but try to pass the torch.William is offered the chance to cover a touring band on the rise (the group a bit preciously named `Stillwater') for Rolling Stone magazine by an unsuspecting editor that doesn't know the kid is only 15. William joins the tour while his worried mother screams to anyone who'll listen that `musicians have kidnapped my son!' She has only let him go because she knows how much he needs this adventure, yet she is deathly afraid of losing her last child. Upon boarding the tour bus, young William/Cameron journeys like Dante into the inferno. He is doggedly pursued by worried messages from mom and accompanied only by his yellow note pad, his long-distance calls to mentor Bangs, and the `Stillwater' family that teaches him about who he is and who he can become. Still waters run deep, indeed.One of his Virgils is the band's enigmatic guitarist, Russell, brought to vivid life in actor Billy Crudup's breakthrough performance as the Rock n Roll hero with feet of clay. The other is the siren Penny Lane, the beautiful free spirit who, as a `band-aid', acts as both muse and sex toy for Crudup. She is ephemeral and damaged, living in devotion to the music. Of course, the Russell-Kate-William triangle is an eternal one, resulting in pain and growth for all concerned. Kate Hudson's Penny Lane is a magical character, and it's a star-making performance, worthy of her Oscar.But the key, supporting player in Crowe's tale is the music. There is a moment in the movie when everyone is on the bus, and it has been a long, bad night. Emotions are frayed. The mood is fragile. Elton John's song `Tiny Dancer' is heard and, one at a time, everyone starts to sing along. Music heals. Families can injure, but they can heal, too. Like his earlier films, music is the heart and soul of this film, both in the dramatic moments and concert scenes, dramatizing the effect on both the players and the audience as together they create, for a moment, a surrogate family for all who need one.It seems at first a small story to build a movie on. Nothing blows up. The sex is mostly off-screen. Like all of Crowe's other pictures, ALMOST FAMOUS is a character study in the coming-of-age genre. But, when seen through the context of his career to date, you realize it's about Crowe coming of age, as much as the characters in the film.Unlike film-school filmmakers, Crowe doesn't make films about films. He makes movies about life. And so, he tells stories about us. They are stories worth telling and he tells them wonderfully well. Like all of Crowe's other films, ALMOST FAMOUS is a tale both personal and universal. It made me reconsider the era I grew up in, and the person I was then and am today. goddamn him. That's the power of a great storyteller and, make no mistake, Crowe is perhaps the foremost auteur of his generation.",4,"A Great Movie...McDormand, Hudson, Fugit and Cast SHINE!",1034553600,"10 14,

Overall, I think the film gives us the image of coming of age, reaching that understanding of who we are and where we want to go.On one level, there are the three main characters who all must come to grips with the life they think they are living and the life they need to live.  The main character, William, is an uncool rock journalist.  He is younger than other kids in his grade at school, and probably too young to travel with the band.  He believes he is cool because that is how the band makes him feel.  After submitting his story, he begins to realize that what he thought about himself was not true.  His mentor helps him come to the realization.Penny Lane, the Band Aide, must also grow as a person.  She has her idealized life, but doesn't understand her place and importance.  After finding out that she has been &quot;traded&quot; and having William attack her dream of a far-off land, she realizes that she must move on.Russell, the guitarist, is trying to understand his place in the band as the leader and as a better musician.  He thinks that he will have what he wants with no repercussions.  He hurts Penny and thinks that he can correct this.  Her getting him with William shows him that he has responsibilities as a person and musician.On the next level, the rock band, Stillwater, is the quintessential band coming at the end of a generation of musicians.  The life they want is no longer there; the scene of rock and roll is progressing, and they must learn to adapt.  The idealized notions they have will hit the wall once they hear of the article on them.  Afterwards, they must mature to continue.This is a fine movie, and I would highly recommend seeing it.

A character who could so easily have turned into a two-dimensional, over-the-top cut-out in her hands becomes a quirky, yet sympathetic and lovable individual.

Following this and the overprotective attitude of his mother (Played by the always entertaining Francis McDormand), WilliamMiller goes on the road to interview the band Stillwater who isheaded by the lead guitarist (Billy Crudup), from then on he starts to travel with these people and meets an upbeat and verybeautiful road groupie named Penny Lane, who is played by thealways gorgeous Kate Hudson, who not only gives a breakthroughperformance, but delivers the performance of her career. I willstop talking here, just see this wonderful wonderful movie. Filmmaker Cameron Crowe may have been put on the map by Say Any-thing and Jerry Maguire, but it is Almost Famous that is hismain crowning achievement and to prove it, he won a more thanwell deserved oscar for best original screenplay.

528973,A1LP6O85Z894GT,B00003CXMG,"J. Remington ""John Remington""","[25, 28]","Cameron Crowe, former teenaged rock critic matured into essayist, screenwriter and film director,  created my favorite film of 2000 (tied with ""O Brother Where Art Thou"") by bottling a precious ingredient found in few movies- real magic.Drawing from his own rich autobiography, Crowe vividly relates the journey of a teenage Odysseus (played here with wide eyed purity by Patrick Fugit) who embarks on a journey of discovery, pain, love, maturation, loss and spiritual awakening.The magic of Almost Famous lies in its characters' abilities to reach that most heroic of human experience: transformation into a better self.Fugit plays William Miller, a fifteen year old genius based upon Crowe himself, who is given the impossible task of writing a ""think piece"" in Rolling Stone magazine about a fictitious rock and roll band called Stillwater. Forced to travel the road with the band and their entourage of ""professional girl friends/fans/groupies""- called band-aides here, Miller finds himself caught between staying true to his calling- writing honestly- and betraying new found friends.Crowe's genius, as previously expressed in his earlier films Say Anything, Jerry Maguire and Singles lies in his ability to craft through careful collaboration with his always superb casts, real people who despite great character flaws and warts, have the spark of goodness inside them. In a Cameron Crowe film, everyone has the chance to be saved- and in their own way- everyone does end up forgiven and transformed.Unlike many of his cold-hearted, mean spirited and cynical film making peers who actively seek out the sordid, the ugly and the destructive in society, Crowe possesses a sincere love not only for his characters and the world they inhabit but for the audience as well. That love radiates throughout every frame of every film he makes (this does not speak to his misstep ""Vanilla Sky"")Crowe also possesses an uncanny instinct to marry music with the film. The sequence fusing Elton John's ""Tiny Dancer"" to a Stillwater's collective forgiveness of Russell Hammond is pure bliss. Of course Crowe creates many other similar sequences with music and image.This is not to suggest Almost Famous sugarcoats the harsh realities of an early 1970's rock and roll experience. Crowe is too honest a storyteller to allow that.  Free sex, drugs and the related decadence are ever present as are the consequences for such behavior. There is a real general callous soulessness that lurks on the tip of each scene threatening to consume the frail humanity of this Odyssey. But that evil is held at bay and ultimately destroyed by the great good that certainly dwells in every character's heart.As consistent with all previous Crowe films, the acting ensemble is perfect. She has so many scenes that literally broke my heart while making me smile. Billy Crudup as self obsessed guitarist Russell Hammond, although far too good looking for any real rock star, swings gloriously unpredictable between sullen silence, affable congeniality and rage. He is a star in the making. Jason Lee, as lead singer Jeff Bebe, possesses just the right amount of shallow intellectual posings, narcissistic self promotion and paranoid uncertainty that prevails so many in his vocation. Frances McDormand is absolutely perfect as Miller's hyper-protective Mother.The director's cut DVD is a God Send. The commentary by Crowe and his mother is priceless as is the fleshed out sequences which manage to humanize and elevate the characters even more. Being able to read the complete script is fascinating also as a reference point. It proves the old addage that all good films must begin with a great script.Almost Famous is Absolute Magic.

As it turns out it is not a movie to loath but one to embrace at least for the moment as it transports you back to that heady time that was the early seventies.  It occurrs to me that this movie will make more sense and have more meaning to people in their forties as (we) lived it about the same time that Cameron Crowe did.  The movie is a bit of a &quot;cop out&quot; as it does not hold true to Crowe's actual/factual experience of being on tour with Led Zeppelin.  Now that would have been a 5 Star movie.  Instead we are treated to the on tour saga of a fictional Stillwater complete with a photograph of the band sitting on anvil cases a la Allman Bros. Band Live at Fillmore East.  Two stand out perfomances are Phillip Seymore as Lester Bangs and Jason Lee as the lead singer of Stillwater.  I read damn near every word Lester ever wrote and I do see him coming off as very cynical but not introverted and uncool as depicted in the film.  Lester/Phillip does have some good lines like:  &quot;Hey man I'm always home, I'm not cool.&quot;Some problems I have with Almost are constant references to the year 1973 when some of the soundtrack songs are from many years forward.  Russell on top of a house with a head full of acid shouting, &quot;i am a golden god&quot;.  A quote later attributed to Robert Plant in Hammer of the Gods.  Crowe's homage to his time with Led Zeppelin?  Not enough sex and drugs but plenty of booze and beer.

528977,A3BRHTAUBZUGK8,B00003CXMG,"Jym Cherry ""Writing Under The Influence of Ro...","[2, 2]","Almost Famous is the world of early 70's Rock `n' Roll when that first flash of the classic rock era had passed. Rock was settling into becoming a business, but still was young enough and still had a sense of innocence about itself that William Miller (Patrick Fugit) an overachieving, yet awkward teenager can be taken seriously as a rock writer, and be assigned by Rolling Stone to tour with and write about an up and coming band. Almost Famous is also my story. An innocent drawn to a world that looks glamorous to him and where he thinks and he'll be cool. It's the story of everyone's innocence of their teenage years.Almost Famous is based on writer/director Cameron Crowe's own experiences. William wants to fit in and his innocence is palpable and real. On his assignment from Rolling Stone to follow the fictional band Stillwater, he finds himself locked out of the Rock `n' Roll world he worships and wishes to be a part of. Even the girls his age, the Band-aids, leave him standing on the outside. The Band-aids lead by Penny Lane (Kate Hudson), don't consider themselves groupies but more like muses for the bands, but are much more learned and experienced than William . It takes the late arrival of his favorite band Stillwater to gain him access to the Rock `n' Roll world he seeks. When William walks into that first concert he is awkward, shy, doesn't know anyone or anything about that world. By the end of the concert he's so caught up in the rush and excitement, he's shouting knowing goodbyes to the bands and roadies. William seeking to be cool he tries to impress Stillwater guitarist Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup) by introducing him to Penny without knowing they have a history. Director Crowe really hits the nail on the head with William's feelings and experience.William's innocence continually betrays him. When he goes to L.A. with Penny, she goes off with Russell. William follows them only to discover them making out. You can see it William's face, he's crushed. He likes Penny but doesn't think someone as glamorous and sophisticated as her would be interested in him. Russell betrays William by promising an interview that never seems to happen. Stillwater betrays William. They befriend him hoping he'll write a favorable article of them for Rolling Stone, but when Rolling Stone verifies William's truthful story, the band disavows it.While William's innocence betrays him he never abandons it. That theme shows itself again and again during the movie. Phillip Seymour Hoffman as Lester Bangs tells William that rock is in it's death rattle since rock has started to become a business. The rock stars portrayed in Almost Famous espouse this, notably lead singer of Stillwater Jeff Beebe (Jason Lee). If one the band's fans could save the world, ""it means rock can save the world!""Frances McDormand as William's sincerely concerned but beleagured mother who fears she`s pushing her children away, William and daughter (Zooey Deschannel) and leads to unintentionally funny moments in her life such as when she tells a group of students ""my son has been kidnapped by rock stars!"" Or that Simon and Garfunkle are poets of drugs and promiscuous sex. Jimmy Fallon is almost unrecognizable as Dennis Hope the professional manager who takes over guiding Stillwater through the hazards of Rock `n' Roll. The casting of Almost Famous lives up to the title of the movie. Almost everyone in it was on the cusp of becoming stars or at the beginning of their careers.By the end of the tour William, who has seen and experienced more than he ever thought he could, and even understands the world better than Penny emerges with his innocence intact. He reunites his mother and sister, and when Russell shows up at William's house, William is still willing and able to get the interview from Russell that he always wanted. Even Russell and the band redeem themselves. Russell calls Rolling Stone and tells them William's story is true, and Stillwater rediscovers the innocence and joy of creating music when they step back from the high power business of Rock `n' Roll and go back to their roots of playing smaller venues.Crowe hits all the right notes in characterization and the times. Everyone seems perfect for their roles and they're delivered with sincerity that most viewers can identify with. The 70's are realistically evoked from the burbling of a bong to a light organ in a fan's bedroom. Almost Famous has a complexity in characters and plot rarely seen in movies. It's truly a movie where everything comes to together to make a near flawlessly executed film.",5,Innocence Betrayed But Not Abandoned,1266969600,"02 24, 2010",2010,4591,"['Almost', 'Famous', 'world', 'early', '70', 'Rock', 'n', 'Roll', 'when', 'first', 'flash', 'classic', 'rock', 'era', 'had', 'passed', 'Rock', 'was', 'settling', 'becoming', 'business', 'still', 'was', 'young', 'enough', 'still', 'had', 'sense', 'innocence', 'William', 'Miller', 'Patrick', 'Fugit', 'overachieving', 'yet', 'awkward', 'teenager', 'can', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'rock', 'writer', 'be', 'assigned', 'Rolling', 'Stone', 'tour', 'write', 'up', 'coming', 'band', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'also', 'story', 'innocent', 'drawn', 'world', 'glamorous', 'where', ""'ll"", 'be', 'cool', 'story', 'everyone', 'innocence', 'teenage', 'years.Almost', 'Famous', 'based', 'writer/director', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'own', 'experiences', 'William', 'fit', 'innocence', 'palpable', 'real', 'assignment', 'Rolling', 'Stone', 'follow', 'fictional', 'band', 'Stillwater', 'locked', 'Rock', 'n', 'Roll', 'world', 'wishes', 'be', 'part', 'Even', 'girls', 'age', 'Band-aids', 'leave', 'standing', 'outside', 'Band-aids', 'lead', 'Penny', 'Lane', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'do', ""n't"", 'consider', 'groupies', 'more', 'like', 'muses', 'bands', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'learned', 'experienced', 'William', 'late', 'arrival', 'favorite', 'band', 'Stillwater', 'gain', 'access', 'Rock', 'n', 'Roll', 'world', 'When', 'William', 'first', 'concert', 'awkward', 'shy', ""n't"", 'know', 'anyone', 'anything', 'world', 'end', 'concert', 'so', 'caught', 'up', 'rush', 'excitement', 'shouting', 'knowing', 'goodbyes', 'bands', 'roadies', 'William', 'seeking', 'be', 'cool', 'impress', 'Stillwater', 'guitarist', 'Russell', 'Hammond', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'introducing', 'Penny', 'knowing', 'have', 'history', 'Director', 'Crowe', 'really', 'nail', 'head', 'William', 'feelings', 'experience.William', 'innocence', 'continually', 'When', 'L.A.', 'Penny', 'Russell', 'William', 'only', 'discover', 'making', 'out', 'can', 'see', 'William', 'face', 'crushed', 'Penny', ""n't"", 'think', 'someone', 'glamorous', 'sophisticated', 'would', 'be', 'interested', 'Russell', 'William', 'promising', 'interview', 'never', 'happen', 'Stillwater', 'William', 'befriend', 'hoping', ""'ll"", 'write', 'favorable', 'article', 'Rolling', 'Stone', 'when', 'Rolling', 'Stone', 'William', 'truthful', 'story', 'band', 'it.While', 'William', 'innocence', 'never', 'theme', 'again', 'again', 'movie', 'Phillip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'Lester', 'Bangs', 'William', 'rock', 'death', 'rattle', 'rock', 'started', 'become', 'business', 'rock', 'stars', 'portrayed', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'espouse', 'notably', 'lead', 'singer', 'Stillwater', 'Jeff', 'Beebe', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'one', 'band', 'fans', 'could', 'save', 'world', 'rock', 'can', 'save', 'world', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'William', 'sincerely', 'concerned', 'beleagured', 'mother', 'who', 's', 'pushing', 'children', 'away', 'William', 'daughter', 'Zooey', 'Deschannel', 'unintentionally', 'funny', 'moments', 'life', 'such', 'when', 'group', 'students', 'son', 'been', 'kidnapped', 'rock', 'stars', 'Simon', 'Garfunkle', 'are', 'poets', 'drugs', 'promiscuous', 'sex', 'Jimmy', 'Fallon', 'almost', 'unrecognizable', 'Dennis', 'Hope', 'professional', 'manager', 'who', 'guiding', 'Stillwater', 'hazards', 'Rock', 'n', 'Roll', 'casting', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'up', 'title', 'movie', 'Almost', 'everyone', 'was', 'cusp', 'becoming', 'stars', 'beginning', 'careers.By', 'end', 'tour', 'William', 'who', 'seen', 'experienced', 'more', 'ever', 'thought', 'could', 'even', 'world', 'better', 'Penny', 'innocence', 'intact', 'mother', 'sister', 'when', 'Russell', 'up', 'William', 'house', 'William', 'still', 'willing', 'able', 'get', 'interview', 'Russell', 'always', 'wanted', 'Even', 'Russell', 'band', 'redeem', 'Russell', 'Rolling', 'Stone', 'William', 'story', 'true', 'Stillwater', 'innocence', 'joy', 'creating', 'music', 'when', 'step', 'back', 'high', 'power', 'business', 'Rock', 'n', 'Roll', 'go', 'back', 'roots', 'playing', 'smaller', 'venues.Crowe', 'right', 'notes', 'characterization', 'times', 'Everyone', 'perfect', 'roles', ""'re"", 'delivered', 'sincerity', 'most', 'viewers', 'can', 'identify', '70', 'are', 'realistically', 'evoked', 'burbling', 'bong', 'light', 'organ', 'fan', 'bedroom', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'complexity', 'characters', 'plot', 'rarely', 'seen', 'movies', 'truly', 'movie', 'where', 'everything', 'together', 'make', 'near', 'flawlessly', 'executed', 'film']",Almost Famous

On the surface it's about music and love, but dig deeper and you'll find so much more.

I adored the phone call and reply 'Has the acid kicked in yet?' and reply, 'How can you tell?' followed by the immediate shot of Russell on the top of a house screaming 'I am on drugs'.The director delivers a sensitivity to the film and the characters, and reveals beauty admist the drug culture and ideasof the 1960's and 1970's. Of particular note was the scene in which the bus sings Elton's classic 'Tiny Dancer' and the aeroplane scene in which members of the band admit their mutual dislike, love and homosexuality. As well as Pennylane's reply 'What kind of beer?' when it is revealed she is traded for $50 and a case of beer.

Gelwasser,"[1, 1]","&quot;Almost Famous&quot; is Cameron Crowe's semi-autobiographical story of how at the tender age of fifteen, he went on the road as a writer for Rolling Stone Magazine. It is also one of the finest movies ever made about the golden age of 1970's rock n'roll. Crowe's alter ego is William Miller (played admirably by Patrick Fugit)who goes on tour with the fictional band, StillWater (a composite of real life rockers the Allmand Brothers, Eagles and Led Zepplin).It is here on the road he must deal with his domineering but loving mother's phone calls, groupies and musicians with outsized egos.Throughout the film William walks a fine tightrope between becoming friends with people who are his heroes and maintaining his journalistic integrity. This film is a brilliant meditation on why we like music and what is the meaning of being a 'true fan'. &quot;Almost Famous Untitled&quot; is Crowe's director's cut of the film.The grapics of the packaging and on screen menus are made to look like that of a 1970's bootleg rock album. It includes over thirty minutes of footage not seen in the original theatrical or initial DVD release. In most films, scenes and dialogue have been originally deleted, because of pacing or the fact that they do not contribute to the story. Many of these director's cuts feel padded and have been put out just to make a quick buck off of fans. This is not the case with &quot;Almost Famous Untitled&quot;. Crowe's additional footage greatly adds to the story and gives us a greater understanding to the motivations and emotions of the characters. I would say this is an improvement over the original cut.This edition also includes many more extras then the initial DVD relese. One glaring ommission from the first DVD release was it's lack of commentary track.This edition makes up for this with Crowe giving us a both inciteful and hilarious commentary with his real life mother. These two laugh and reminice with great chemistry and make it very obvious, that their relationship was accurately captured in the movie.

528984,A3D822N1K2IAQD,B00003CXMG,Kenneth Stuart,"[0, 0]","The media has done an effective job of convincing the world that nothing existed between the Baby-Boomer generation and Generation-X, between the 1960s and the 1980s.However, there was indeed another generation in-between, that is quite different from those who came before and those who came after.  While the Baby-Boomers were (and still are) primarily concerned with ideology and rebelling against their parents, the generation that came of age in the 1970s was primarily concerned with art - especially rock music - and spirituality.Cameron Crowe is the first person from this generation to create an accurate portrayal of the 1970s and our generation.  How far off most previous depictions have been, is easily demonstrated by the media equating the 70s and .... disco !  Disco didn't start until the 1970s were OVER.All the characters in the film, from William Miller and Penny Lane, down through the Zeppelin fan to the partygoers in Topeka, are all amazing accurate and correspond closely to people who I knew at the time.All the locations in the film, particularly backstage at the San Diego Sports Arena and at the Continental Hyatt on the Sunset Strip, were also amazingly accurate - not only in terms of the look and feel , but also in terms of what went on there - as I was there, in both locations, during the 70s.  (The scenes were really shot on location, with current furnishings replaced by what used to be there in 1973.)And, furthermore, all the dialogue was precisely the way we talked in the 70s, as well as what we would talk about.  And, lastly, the music was really what we listened to.  You couldn't avoid hearing Elton John, Led Zeppelin, Neil Young and The Who, among many others.All this amazing accuracy is made possible by the film being an autobiography.  The claims that it is &quot;only semi-autobiographical&quot;, seem on close examination to be mainly for legal purposes, like the disclaimer at the end that all the characters are fictional, when in fact I've met personally more than one of the well-known named personalities in the film.What is remarkable is that Cameron was able to remember so clearly many of the tiny details, details which make the film like a time machine for those of us who &quot;came of age&quot; in the 1970s.It's very satisfying that now the record has been set straight, and that there is finally a true depiction of those times, that are of great significance in the lives of a generation who previously were not even acknowledged as existing!Many thanks to Cameron Crowe for putting us on the map!And please see all the other fine reviews on this page for descriptions of the excellent acting and filmmaking in this production.",5,The first accurate portrayal of the 1970s and its generation,987120000,"04 13, 2001",2001,2696,"['media', 'done', 'effective', 'job', 'convincing', 'world', 'nothing', 'existed', 'Baby-Boomer', 'generation', 'Generation-X', '1960s', '1980s.However', 'was', 'indeed', 'generation', 'in-between', 'quite', 'different', 'who', 'came', 'who', 'came', 'Baby-Boomers', 'were', 'still', 'are', 'primarily', 'concerned', 'ideology', 'rebelling', 'parents', 'generation', 'came', 'age', '1970s', 'was', 'primarily', 'concerned', 'art', 'especially', 'rock', 'music', 'spirituality.Cameron', 'Crowe', 'first', 'person', 'generation', 'create', 'accurate', 'portrayal', '1970s', 'generation', 'How', 'far', 'most', 'previous', 'depictions', 'have', 'been', 'easily', 'demonstrated', 'media', 'equating', '70s', 'disco', 'Disco', 'did', ""n't"", 'start', '1970s', 'were', 'OVER.All', 'characters', 'film', 'William', 'Miller', 'Penny', 'Lane', 'down', 'Zeppelin', 'fan', 'partygoers', 'Topeka', 'are', 'amazing', 'accurate', 'correspond', 'closely', 'people', 'who', 'knew', 'time.All', 'locations', 'film', 'particularly', 'backstage', 'San', 'Diego', 'Sports', 'Arena', 'Continental', 'Hyatt', 'Sunset', 'Strip', 'were', 'also', 'amazingly', 'accurate', 'not', 'only', 'terms', 'look', 'feel', 'also', 'terms', 'went', 'was', 'there', 'locations', '70s', 'scenes', 'were', 'really', 'shot', 'location', 'current', 'furnishings', 'replaced', 'what', 'used', 'be', 'there', '1973', 'furthermore', 'dialogue', 'was', 'precisely', 'way', 'talked', '70s', 'as', 'well', 'what', 'would', 'talk', 'lastly', 'music', 'was', 'really', 'what', 'listened', 'could', ""n't"", 'avoid', 'hearing', 'Elton', 'John', 'Led', 'Zeppelin', 'Neil', 'Young', 'Who', 'many', 'others.All', 'amazing', 'accuracy', 'made', 'possible', 'film', 'being', 'autobiography', 'claims', 'quot', 'only', 'semi-autobiographical', 'quot', 'seem', 'close', 'examination', 'be', 'mainly', 'legal', 'purposes', 'disclaimer', 'end', 'characters', 'are', 'fictional', 'when', 'fact', ""'ve"", 'met', 'personally', 'more', 'one', 'well-known', 'named', 'personalities', 'film.What', 'remarkable', 'Cameron', 'was', 'able', 'remember', 'so', 'clearly', 'many', 'tiny', 'details', 'details', 'make', 'film', 'time', 'machine', 'who', 'quot', 'came', 'age', 'quot', '1970s.It', 'very', 'satisfying', 'now', 'record', 'been', 'set', 'straight', 'finally', 'true', 'depiction', 'times', 'are', 'great', 'significance', 'lives', 'generation', 'who', 'previously', 'were', 'not', 'even', 'acknowledged', 'existing', 'Many', 'thanks', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'putting', 'map', 'please', 'see', 'other', 'fine', 'reviews', 'page', 'descriptions', 'excellent', 'acting', 'filmmaking', 'production']",Almost Famous

I was not disappointed.From Patrick Fugit as William Miller, the young writer, to Frances McDormand as his mother, to Billy Crudup as the lead guitarist of the band that William goes on tour with, the performances are extraordinary.  When you add in Kate Hudson in a luminescent role as Penny Lane, a groupie (excuse me, Band-aid) and Philip Seymour Hoffman as the editor of Creem magazine, you have a film that is like a great desert.  You savor each scene, and can't wait to see what happens next.The DVD is crisp in terms of audio and crystal clear in terms of video.  The soundtrack, which could have been either predictable or purposefully obtuse turns out to be just right.  If you can make it through the &quot;Tiny Dancer&quot; scene without a smile on your face, you are unsalvageable.I did not particularly enjoy the seventies.  I was exactly the age of William in this film, but actually enjoyed the music of the fifties and early sixties better at the time.  (I am the product of a family that listened to early Elvis, country, and classic fifties rock).  However, this film gives me an appreciation of the era.Cameron Crowe captures the feel of a segment of society that has come through the late sixties flower-power era and has developed a hard-edge, in things like their drug use and their attitudes towards money and success. At the same time, he portrays them as what they truly were - just kids who wanted to make music, write, be part of the scene, but, at the same time, realized that being successful at what they did was not necessarily a bad thing.Buy this DVD and enjoy it.

The story is fun and there are some fine performances by Patrick Fugit, Billy Crudup, Jason Lee and Phillip Seymour Hoffman.  However, I thought the characters played by Kate Hudson and Frances McDormand were extremely annoying and definitely not worthy of the Oscar nominations they have received for their performances.  I think Cameron Crowe must be friends with Goldie Hawn and agreed to get closeup after closeup of her little girl Kate so that she can become a star based on her beauty.  But she doesn't do much for the film in my opinion (the same goes for former Oscar winner Anna Paquin, who plays one of Kate's fellow &quot;band-aids&quot;).I also thought that since the character played by Fugit (Billy Miller) is essentially Cameron Crowe himself, he pretty much has portrayed himself as a perfect child with few faults.

And watching Patrick Fugit portray an intelligent, kind, passionate, and yet, uncool, music fan strikes a real chord in the heart of every aging teen misfit.The real blind spot of this movie lies with the lack of emotional substance: as a journalist, William has been warned to remain impartial to the celebrity of musicians, which he does, but he also seems distant from the music itself; Kate Hudson as Penny Lane idolizes the band, but mostly you see her involved in a damaged, temporary fling with no emotional component; Frances McDormand is the greatest success here, yet her maternal embraces kind of fall into a litany of &quot;don't do drugs, and remember you can't swim&quot; - you get the idea.Even with that, Cameron Crowe's films can't be held to that strict a standard.

This movie is by far one of his best films yet.Set in 1973, Almost Famous tells the story of 15-year-old William Miller (Patrick Fugit), who's dream is to become a great rock journalist while his overprotective mother strives for her son to go to law school. After writing some pieces for local magazines, the editor of Rolling Stone magazine contacts William (not knowing that he is only 15) and sets him up to go on tour with the up and coming band Stillwater. While on tour, William falls for a ""Band-Aid"" named Penny Lane (Kate Hudson). He becomes torn between wanting to belong with his new rock star friends and his wanting to be a ""honest and unmerciful"" rock journalist.Almost Famous is an adaptation of Cameron Crowe's real life. He was William Miller. Cameron Crowe actually did write for Rolling stone when he was in high school and really did tour with all kinds of rock stars (i.e.- Led Zepplin and the Allman Brothers). He even reveals in the commentary (which unfortunately is only located on the directors special two-disc edition) that there was a girl he knew while on tour who went by the name Penny Lane. The character of Penny Lane was derived from many girls who went on tour with the bands simply because they loved their music.Amazing movie, amazing performances by the actors, amazing music.

Billy Crudup, with his chiseled good looks plays the lead guitarist of the band and his role goes beyond the stereotype of a rock musician.  And then there is the lovely Kate Hudson, who adds sparkle and sensitivity to her role as a groupie.  William Seymour Hoffman also adds his talents as the writer/rock critic who the young William looks up to as his mentor.  It's a great cast.The best part of this film, though,  was the way the screenplay captured the time and place of the rock music scene of the 70s.  Some of the music was original and some were old favorites such as &quot;America&quot; by Simon and Garfunkel, &quot;Every Picture tells a Story&quot; by Rod Stewart and :The Wind&quot; by Cat Stevens.  The details were all there -- the attitude, clothing, and youthful energy that was so much a part of the times.  I couldn't help but notice though that even though drugs were talked about, there wasn't much on-screen drug use. This is to the film's credit which was, basically, about the relationships between the people as well as the music.The world that this film captures so well is long gone.  The characters have grown up and the young reporter is now a successful Hollywood screenwriter. The intensity of the times have faded and we now live in a world of computers and cell phones.  What a delight it was though to again feel the pulse of the 70s and hear the music once again.",5,"The time, the place and the music of the 70s recaptured",987033600,"04 12, 2001",2001,1993,"['original', 'screenplay', 'won', 'academy', 'award', 'year', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'lot', 'heart', 'based', 'writer/director', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'own', 'experience', 'teenage', 'writer', 'Rolling', 'Stone', 'Magazine.The', 'young', 'Patrick', 'Fugit', 'cast', 'William', 'Miller', '15-year-old', 'reporter', 'who', 'combination', 'pluck', 'luck', 'manages', 'get', 'assignment', 'write', 'fictional', 'rock', 'band', 'Stillwater', 'true', 'innocent', 'role', 'wide-eyed', 'wonder', 'up', 'traveling', 'band', 'much', 'upset', 'mother', 'played', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'chiseled', 'good', 'looks', 'lead', 'guitarist', 'band', 'role', 'stereotype', 'rock', 'musician', 'then', 'lovely', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'who', 'sparkle', 'sensitivity', 'role', 'groupie', 'William', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'also', 'talents', 'writer/rock', 'critic', 'who', 'young', 'William', 'up', 'mentor', 'great', 'cast.The', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'was', 'way', 'screenplay', 'captured', 'time', 'place', 'rock', 'music', 'scene', '70s', 'music', 'was', 'original', 'were', 'old', 'favorites', 'such', 'quot', 'America', 'quot', 'Simon', 'Garfunkel', 'quot', 'Every', 'Picture', 'Story', 'quot', 'Rod', 'Stewart', 'Wind', 'quot', 'Cat', 'Stevens', 'details', 'were', 'attitude', 'clothing', 'youthful', 'energy', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'part', 'times', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'notice', 'even', 'drugs', 'were', 'talked', 'about', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'on-screen', 'drug', 'use', 'film', 'credit', 'was', 'basically', 'relationships', 'people', 'as', 'well', 'music.The', 'world', 'film', 'so', 'well', 'long', 'gone', 'characters', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'young', 'reporter', 'now', 'successful', 'Hollywood', 'screenwriter', 'intensity', 'times', 'have', 'faded', 'now', 'live', 'world', 'computers', 'cell', 'phones', 'What', 'delight', 'was', 'again', 'feel', 'pulse', '70s', 'hear', 'music', 'once', 'again']",Almost Famous

528999,ADJXL0W0RJ7VV,B00003CXMG,Lord Chimp,"[12, 13]","Almost Famous is a charming movie with heart and soul rarely found in today's mire of blockbusters. I found Almost Famous appealing on many different levels, and while it wasn't a tremendously funny film, I wore a snug smile continually while watching it.On one level, it's a great movie about a talented and earnest teenager commissioned by Rolling Stone Magazine to write a feature on a rock band called Stillwater (they don't know he's only fifteen, of course). His name is William Miller, and he has become liberated from the vehement values of his mother through rock music. He develops a passion for it, and his role as a young rock critic garners the attention of Rolling Stone. On the road with the band, he meets (and becomes infatuated with) Penny Lane, a groupie whose character (played by the lovely Kate Hudson) is heartbreakingly delicate. She tries to rationalize her existence and rejects the notion of being emotionally damaged by this fantasy world lacking morality.  William is saddened by how Russell (Stillwater's guitarist) treats her, and helps her out in the end. William also befriends the aforementioned guitarist Russell, and their developing relationship allows them both to learn from each other.On an ancillary level, it's a movie about rock music. During William's travels with the band, the band scores with a successful record, endures battles of ego, and goes through management changes. Although Stillwater is a fictional band, the script and director's canny sense of time and the business could trick you into thinking they were real. It's about the pragmatics versus of ideals of the industry. It's about a critic's integrity, the cruelties of the biz, and more.Why this movie is so wonderful is that it's a great movie about growing up. William's exploits with the band parallel coming-of-age for most teenagers. He is a starry-eyed idealist who witnesses the broken hearts and inclemency of the real world, yet still steadfastly clutches at confidence and optimism. William is a smart kid, and his character is very well-acted with the right amounts of naivet&eacute; and youthful exuberance to add credence to his role.

Cameron Crowe is obviously an authentic student of the era.  If you don't know that the story is a rough autobiography of Crowe's own experience as the enfant terrible of rock journalism, you may find the plot to be unbelievable.Crowe admits to combining many of the elements of several rock bands that he chronicled for Creem and Rolling Stone to create Stillwater, the fictional rock band of this tale.  Sights, sounds, clothing and thought processes of the era are all faithfully reported in this gem of a movie.Watching the Crowe interview in the special features section, and checking out his Rolling Stone articles, you know that the casting director for the film was a genius.  Unknown Patrick Fugit has many of the mannerisms and wistfulness that made &quot;then-Cameron&quot; and &quot;now-Cameron&quot; delightful and admirable.The real star of the movie is the music, and the mix of authentic and pretend rock of the era, along with some of its unusual anthems (all of Elton John's early music touched cords in rock lovers - we weren't sure why we loved it, but we did).  The group scenes in the movie, most set to music, have an authentic camaraderie and sense of &quot;chilling&quot; that made ecletic groups of band members such memorable icons of the era.Crowe was obviously enamored of both his mom and Lester Bangs, an early mentor.  He cast them richly with the incredible Frances McDormand and a beautiful cameo piece by Phillip Seymour Hoffman.Many of the band members and wannabes were well cast, but the centerpiece is Kate Hudson, who illuminates the screen with her charisma and vulnerability.

Yet, much like an Old Navy commercial, this film fits into this rare category.There's something pre-9/11 about this movie's tone; some sort of vacuous innocence that wouldn't work in a movie made today.

He quickly discovers two things  - he needs to grow up fast - and he has a gift for getting out of jams by convoluting the truth (like all the best writers do). And this is before he has to deal with his overbearing potty mother who seems obsessed with him not doing anything - let alone having promiscuous sex and copious amounts of hallucinogenic drugs (what a meanie).Then one afternoon in hair-curlers and to the backdrop of Simon & Garfunkel's ""America"" his older sister Anita has finally had enough of `no' Mum and exits the nest (dialogue above) leaving young William a parting gift that will shape his whole life - a carry bag full of vinyl albums under his bed. Inside is - Crosby, Stills & Nash's self-titled debut from 1969 on Atlantic, The Rolling Stones ""Get Your Ya Ya's Out"" (1970), Led Zeppelin's ""II"" (1969), Joni Mitchell's ""Blue"" (1971) and The Who's double ""Tommy"". Lighting a candle as instructed by sis (an early part for the gorgeous Zooey Deschanel) - William puts the needle down on the original 1969 US Decca vinyl of The Who and is transformed...Written and Directed by Cameron Crowe - ""Almost Famous"" (2000) is his homage to Rock and a touchstone for suckers like me. I know all the references - all the feelings - all the inexplicably gorgeous women way out of your desert-boots reach. Why - because like so many of my generation - I lived it. And like many of us Crowe also seems to feel that something changed between 1973 and 1975 - Rock 'n' Roll somehow died and got replaced with pomposity and drugs and dumb Rock Stars as Gods who had no answers anymore - corrupted by a hard in their pants and an itch in their arms...Sporting a fantastic ensemble group of actors - soppy-faced Patrick Fugit (as William) does well to keep up with Kate Hudson, Billy Crudup, Jason Lee, Noah Taylor, Anna Paquin, Fairuza Balk and Frances McDormand. But you also forget just how good Philip Seymour Hoffman was (even then). He plays Rock Critic Lester Bangs with a relish and character accuracy that is astonishing. As he eyes with horrified insider knowledge the naivety of the now 15-year old William hustling for a career in Rock journalism - Lester correctly surmises that the icons William loves so much will eat him up and spit him out a truly sullied being. But the kid is just so damn earnest...so Lester tells him ""to be honest and unmerciful..."" and hopes he'll survive a tour with rising rock band Stillwater who are supporting Black Sabbath on a US tour. Cue tour bus rides with paperbacks of Ray Bradbury, Circle magazine, sexy girls with long flowing hair boogieing to The Allman Brothers and the most fantastic use of an Elton John song in any movie - ever (""Tiny Dancer"" from 1971's ""Madman Across The Water""). There follows spaced-out DJs, dodgy promoters, electrified mike stands, trashed hotel rooms, Rolling Stone magazine deadlines, band squabbles and his ever-present mother phoning about drugs every ten minutes (and she'd be right too). There's even an early but memorable cameo from Modern Family's Eric Stonestreet as Sheldon The Hotel Desk Clerk (he gets about 4 lines)...The BLU RAY picture quality is lovely (if not unremarkable) throughout and at 1.85:1 aspect ratio - fills the entire screen. Audio is English TrueHD 5.1 while Subtitles include Arabic, Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, English For The Hard Of Hearing, English, Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian, Icelandic, Korean, Mandarin, Polish, Portuguese (Brazilian), Romanian, Slovak, Slovene, Spanish (Latin American), Thai and Turkish. But the two extras are a major let down - ""Love Comes And Goes"" features the cast goofing about on sets without any dialogue to camera which is awkward and uninformative (although Nancy Wilson's demo of the rock song ""Love Comes And Goes"" is great) - while the ""Lester Bangs Interview"" features the real Creem Magazine writer in archive footage bitching about the vacuous nature of Bryan Ferry and ELP (it's good but last mere minutes - not enough of it).It should also be noted that this BLU RAY features only the half-hour more 'Extended Cut' of the film (2000 DVD has the original film at 122 minutes). It would have been better to include both versions - but at least the longer 'Director's Cut' does feature material that expands the fictional band's relationship with their fans and more of William's coming-of-age - and it genuinely adds rather than detracts.True - the album date lines are a bit screwed about with and careful scrutiny will reveal continuity problems - but none of that stops ""Almost Famous"" being magical to someone like me. And as you sit there - marvelling at just how truly gorgeous Led Zeppelin's acoustic ""That's The Way"" from ""III"" is - you're transported to a time when music could change the world and expand your horizons and record shops were places you stood in shaking with excitement at what new thrill you would find...""Now's the time to look again..."" Robert Plant sings on that lovely song (Track 3 on Side 2).Turns out that even in 1970 - one of Blighty's best ever singers was right...PS: Crowe went on to make the equally wonderful music-laden

Almost Famous follows the path of a 15 year-old writer for Rolling Stone as he tours with the almost famous rock band in the seventies called Stillwater.  Patrick Fugit plays the writer, named Wiliam Miller.  While he is with them, he meets up with Kate Hudson, a groupie with the band.  He falls in love with her, even though he knows that she'll be gone soon.  Stillwater is your typical rock band from the seventies: Sex, Drugs, and Rock &amp; Roll.  It is warming to see William see things for the first time in his life and just look around in awe with gleaming eyes.  One of the best scenes in the movie is when William's mother (played wonderfully by Frances Mcdormand) calls one of the members of the band (played by Billy Crudup) and disciplines him and says, &quot;You still have substance left in you.  Do something with your life.&quot;  Russell, (Billy Crudup) the wild drunkun guy, can only respond with &quot;Yes, Ma'am.&quot;  Almost Famous is enlightening and provocative.  This is a movie that you can sit down to in a bad mood, and emerge warm and happy. The music is also terrific with Simon and Garfunkel, Led Zeppelin, Cat Stevens, The Who, Yes, and Stillwater themselves all on the soundtrack.  Simon and Garfunkel's America especially sets the mood in one scene near the beginning.  There is terrific acting by all and a great plot.  This is a true story of the director Cameron Crowe, who also wrote this movie.  Crowe was actually a young reporter for Rolling Stone when he was 15.  Cameron Crowe does a terrific job of bringing his story to life on the screen. He develops the characters so well that you actually feel like you are traveling through the Rock and Roll world with William Miller.  Almost Famous is funny, touching, happy, enlightening, provocotive, and great in almost every way.

529011,A1HFIKNWLABJIN,B00003CXMG,"mark ""weeping_guitar""","[3, 3]","I guess it goes without saying that history is best told by those who lived and participated within it. It's never been more true than in Almost Famous, Cameron Crowe's film of a young journalist who gets sucked into the rock world, much like happened to Crowe in his teenage years. The film is a sentimental treat, even for those who didn't exist in the early '70s when it took place.William Miller (Patrick Fugit) is incredibly youthful looking for his class and soon learns why when he's told he's been skipped ahead a few times. His overprotective single mother (Frances McDormand) has finally driven his sister to leave home, but her one gift to William is the record collection she's been hiding from their mother. William's life is never the same as the likes of Bob Dylan and the Who navigate his life down a new, exciting path.While in high school William sends his writings out to various publications, gaining the attention of legendary critic Lester Bangs (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) of Creem Magazine. He schools William in the art of rock writing and reminds him that they are firstly not cool, secondly are to avoid becoming friends of the rock stars because it will destroy all sincerity of his writing, and lastly to watch out for big time magazines like Rollingstone who will end up editing up his stories. Rollingstone Magazine has taken notice of Mr. Miller and they offer to send him on the road with the band Stillwater if he'll get their story.Here's where all seems to go wrong. William quickly becomes friends of the lead guitarist of Stillwater, Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup), as well as Russell's mistress of the road, Penny Lane (Kate Hudson). The trouble William soon runs into not only trying to get his information and interviews but attempting to balance his journalist duties and his friendships is the bulk of the story and what ends up attaching us not only to William, but Penny and Russell as well. William knows he could make or break Stillwater but doesn't want to alienate the band or his magazine.Every sequence is filled with love, compassion, confusion of youth, and humanity. William is only 15 and he's trying to be this adult he's not ready to be yet. He's trying to make sure he doesn't get used by the band while trying to figure out why Penny can't see she's ultimately being used by Russell. William and Russell's relationship is one based on trust that they know when each is in their professional or friends mode and their actions and words jump around based on who is functioning as what. William and Penny's relationship is just as complex, they confide in each other all the things they can't with Russell and the band.As good as the central actors are, it's the supporting cast that steals the show. McDormand is flat out amazing as the worried mother who constantly is trying to keep track of her son a thousand miles away who she says has been kidnapped by rock stars. Hoffman is every bit the legendary Lester Bangs who is William's sole calming influence and his words are truer than William could have known as he sees all too well his prot&eacute;g&eacute; was suckered by the rock lifestyle.It's apparent Crowe would not have given up his experiences in the rock and roll world as a youngster up for anything. Throughout the film the one thing that everyone, no matter if they're on each other's side or not, can agree on is that music can make a difference and when they're having troubles music is the one thing that can bring them back together.",5,This Film is nearly a Golden God,1042934400,"01 19, 2003",2003,3510,"['guess', 'saying', 'history', 'best', 'told', 'who', 'lived', 'participated', 'never', 'been', 'more', 'true', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'film', 'young', 'journalist', 'who', 'sucked', 'rock', 'world', 'much', 'happened', 'Crowe', 'teenage', 'years', 'film', 'sentimental', 'treat', 'even', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'exist', 'early', ""'70s"", 'when', 'took', 'place.William', 'Miller', 'Patrick', 'Fugit', 'incredibly', 'youthful', 'looking', 'class', 'soon', 'learns', 'why', 'when', 'told', 'been', 'skipped', 'ahead', 'few', 'times', 'overprotective', 'single', 'mother', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'finally', 'driven', 'sister', 'leave', 'home', 'one', 'gift', 'William', 'record', 'collection', 'been', 'hiding', 'mother', 'William', 'life', 'never', 'same', 'likes', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'Who', 'navigate', 'life', 'down', 'new', 'exciting', 'path.While', 'high', 'school', 'William', 'writings', 'out', 'various', 'publications', 'gaining', 'attention', 'legendary', 'critic', 'Lester', 'Bangs', 'Phillip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'Creem', 'Magazine', 'schools', 'William', 'art', 'rock', 'writing', 'are', 'firstly', 'not', 'cool', 'secondly', 'are', 'avoid', 'becoming', 'friends', 'rock', 'stars', 'will', 'destroy', 'sincerity', 'writing', 'lastly', 'watch', 'out', 'big', 'time', 'magazines', 'Rollingstone', 'who', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'editing', 'up', 'stories', 'Rollingstone', 'Magazine', 'taken', 'notice', 'Mr.', 'Miller', 'offer', 'send', 'road', 'band', 'Stillwater', ""'ll"", 'get', 'story.Here', 'where', 'go', 'wrong', 'William', 'quickly', 'friends', 'lead', 'guitarist', 'Stillwater', 'Russell', 'Hammond', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'as', 'well', 'Russell', 'mistress', 'road', 'Penny', 'Lane', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'trouble', 'William', 'soon', 'not', 'only', 'trying', 'get', 'information', 'interviews', 'attempting', 'balance', 'journalist', 'duties', 'friendships', 'bulk', 'story', 'what', 'up', 'attaching', 'not', 'only', 'William', 'Penny', 'Russell', 'as', 'well', 'William', 'could', 'make', 'break', 'Stillwater', ""n't"", 'want', 'alienate', 'band', 'magazine.Every', 'sequence', 'filled', 'love', 'compassion', 'confusion', 'youth', 'humanity', 'William', 'only', '15', 'trying', 'be', 'adult', 'not', 'ready', 'be', 'yet', 'trying', 'make', 'sure', ""n't"", 'get', 'used', 'band', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'Penny', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'ultimately', 'being', 'used', 'Russell', 'William', 'Russell', 'relationship', 'one', 'based', 'trust', 'know', 'when', 'professional', 'friends', 'mode', 'actions', 'words', 'jump', 'around', 'based', 'who', 'functioning', 'what', 'William', 'Penny', 'relationship', 'just', 'complex', 'confide', 'other', 'things', 'ca', ""n't"", 'Russell', 'band.As', 'good', 'central', 'actors', 'are', 'supporting', 'cast', 'show', 'McDormand', 'flat', 'out', 'amazing', 'worried', 'mother', 'who', 'constantly', 'trying', 'keep', 'track', 'son', 'thousand', 'miles', 'away', 'who', 'been', 'kidnapped', 'rock', 'stars', 'Hoffman', 'bit', 'legendary', 'Lester', 'Bangs', 'who', 'William', 'sole', 'calming', 'influence', 'words', 'are', 'truer', 'William', 'could', 'have', 'known', 'too', 'well', 'prot', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'was', 'suckered', 'rock', 'lifestyle.It', 'apparent', 'Crowe', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'given', 'up', 'experiences', 'rock', 'roll', 'world', 'youngster', 'up', 'anything', 'film', 'one', 'thing', 'everyone', 'matter', ""'re"", 'other', 'side', 'not', 'can', 'agree', 'music', 'can', 'make', 'difference', 'when', ""'re"", 'having', 'troubles', 'music', 'one', 'thing', 'can', 'bring', 'back', 'together']",Almost Famous

529013,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00003CXMG,Matthew Horner,"[5, 6]","Sometimes a film comes along, and it enchants and excites you. It makes you believe in movie magic again. This may happen infrequently, but when it does, it reminds you of what made you fall in love with the movies to begin with. Of course, even the best movie triggers these feelings in only part of its audience. For me, Almost Famous is one of those pictures. Since the print media and the visual media are so different, I doubt this review can tell you if the film has the same in store for you.Writer and director Cameron Crowe has had a charmed life, and he knows it, as can be seen in this partly autobiographical and partly fictionalized tale. When he was just fifteen years old, he got the first of several writing assignment from Rolling Stone magazine. Almost Famous is the story of a kid on the road with a rock and roll band in the early 1970s.Young William Miller [Patrick Fugit] has come to the attention of Rolling Stone because of some articles he wrote for Creem magazine. The assignment comes via telephone, and the editors are unaware that they are hiring a teenager. William doesn't have much luck hooking up the band Stillwater until he gets a little help from a groupie called Penny Lane [Kate Hudson]. Penny is in love with Stillwater's lead guitarist, Russell [Billy Crudup]. Since he has a girlfriend back in New York, she tries to pretend she's just a friend, but everyone sees right through her. William's mother, Elaine [Frances McDormand], who has already alienated her daughter, Anita [Zooey Deschanel], is reluctant to let William go. She gives in when he promises to be back in time for high school graduation and swears he won't do drugs. He keeps his word on the drugs, but the tour and the group mesmerize the kid. He winds up on the road with them for weeks. It is, to say the least, an interesting trip.This is perhaps the best coming of age movie I have ever seen. It ranks arguably at the top of movies about rock and roll, and it certainly feels like the most authentic. The songs performed by Stillwater were written for the movie by Crowe and others, and they fit in seamlessly with the vintage rock and roll tunes played throughout the film. The look and the feel of the 70s is captured perfectly. It was a very different time for music. It was a period when talent and idealism ruled the scene. It would not be long until all pop music was all confiscated by vast corporations. You see the beginnings of this process in the movie when a creep from the record company comes in to replace the band's long time manager and friend.The acting is all world-class. Francis McDormand and Kate Hudson were deservedly nominated for Academy awards, but the whole cast is uniformly excellent.This movie has a lot of drama in it, but it also has a lot of laughs. It remains upbeat more often than not. It has heart, something that is lacking in many films, but it is never sappy or sentimental. it touches you without making you feel manipulated. It is, I suspect, the best movie of last year.Rated R for language, drug content and brief nudity. [I disagree with the MPAA on this one. I think Almost Famous is perfect for teens.

529017,APOUYO1BEPK22,B00003CXMG,"M. B Cole ""Kegrun""","[4, 4]","It's 1973 and William Miller (Patrick Fugit) is about to have one of the craziest adventures of his lifetime. He's writing a piece on the new up and coming rock band Stillwater for the magazine Rolling Stones. He's going to get to go on tour with them and write about anything he wants about them for the next month or so. First though he has to get permission from him mom (Frances McDormand)... because he's only 15.Before he gets this little gig, he's trying to get an interview with Black Sabbath when he meets Penny Lane (Kate Hudson), who's not just a groupie, but a Band-Aid. The difference being, she's in it for the music and not the sex with someone popular. Penny is definitely one of those `out of this world' types of girls. Not just in looks, but in her actions as well. She's a legend to the rock bands because she's just so much fun to have around, and she can always light up a room when she steps into it. She tugs on the tendrils of every heart of every man who comes into contact with her. But the only man she truly wants is Russell Hammond.Will is accepted as a friend and not just `the enemy' as usual by the band members of Stillwater. Most notably by Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup) and Jeff Bebe (Jason Lee). Jeff is the lead singer and Russell is the lead guitarist and also heart throb of the group. While Jeff is sort of an open book for Will, it's Russell he's a bit more interested in, mainly because Russ never really gives that interview he's looking for, but more than not just some one liner quotes. As time goes on, we see how the band has some inner turmoil due to Russell's looks. He's becoming the front man of the band when it was supposed to be Jeff, like the plan was. Just like a lot of bands, this one started off great, but slowly, it could be coming to an end.I absolutely love this movie. Every time I watch it I have a big smile on my face almost the whole the time. From the atmosphere to the music to the settings to the parties, everything just makes me happy. Maybe it's because somewhere deep down in me I'm a rock star myself. Sure I can't sing, nor play an instrument (recorders don't count!), but by god I'm a rock star! The whole story is so much fun to watch unfold. Getting to witness the first time William gets to go back stage to the first time he gets to hang out at a hotel party, all the while making sure he calls his mom in the morning to check in, is just so much fun.I actually watched `The Bootleg Cut' of this movie to do this review, and I'm pretty sure it was the first time I ever watched it. It's mostly the same, but more Penny Lane. Those parts were good but there were some parts that I still thought that should've been left out. For instance one scene has Will writing some paper, and his sisters ex comes in his window and starts talking to him about nonsense. It felt very weird and definitely should've been left out. Some scenes I could see why they were left out but were ok I guess. Like a scene that involves Stillwater going to a radio station and doing and interview with a drugged out DJ. It was kind of funny and also a little informative of the situation between Russ and Jeff. But they also left out some scenes. I don't remember them all, but I do remember one. It was the scene where Will is in the hotel room and has some of the girls jumping around him and basically it's left to us, but he has sex with them, which is his first time having sex. They left that out. That was a great scene, so I don't know why it was taken out. Oh well.Also all the actors were great. Kate Hudson was very good, and I love the scene where Will tells her someone sold her for 50 bucks and a case of beer. She starts to cry just a tad, and then asks, ""What kind of beer?"" and smiles with a tear still rolling down her face. That was awesome. Patrick Fugit was good also, being the nice, sweet, and innocent kid and getting introduced to the life of the rock star.  Jason Lee rocked his part perfectly. He just had that 70's rock band swagger with the long hair flowing and not a care in the world except for his band being awesome. I also liked Billy Crudup and really everyone that was in Stillwater. They just seemed like a real band. So real I'd love to get a faux poster of the actual actors in their get up with a big STILLWATER above them. And Frances McDormand was just phenomenal as the mom of William. You honestly couldn't help love her. She was a great mom, even though a little crazy. You could tell she loved her kids, but was just a little too protective (so the movie makes you think). I actually thought she wasn't that protective though like the movie makes her out to be. Seriously she let her 15 year old kid go on tour with Stillwater to write for the Rolling Stones. At 15 I had to be home by 8pm and 9pm on weekends.It was also fun to see a lot of cameos. Jimmy Fallon (a little more than a cameo), Nick Swardson, Peter Frampton, Zack Ward, Martin Starr, and a lot more.In the end, man I would definitely say own this movie and make it the bootleg edition. That way you can watch both movies versions. I would DEFINITELY watch the award winning Theatrical Version first though.P.S. - The bootleg edition comes with a 6 song EP of Stillwater. I love this CD. `Fever Dog' sounds so good as well as the other songs. I just wish I knew who really sang these songs.",5,I didn't invent the rainy day man.

Daneker,"[1, 1]","Almost Famous is Cameron Crowe's third time writing and directing and after Jerry McGuire he has a lot to accomplish here.This mostly Autobiographical story follows you William, a fifteen year old as he tours with an up and coming 70's rock band for a dream shot at writing for Rolling Stone. After finding out his mother lied to him about his age because he skipped ahead to years in school and didn't understand at 12 why he hadn't hit puberty - because she has let him believe he was 14. Sounds preposterous, yes, but it happened. Much of what you see here really did in some for.Fictional band Stillwater stands in as a composite of several bands Crowe actually interviewed as a teenager. Lead by Billy Cruduptand Jason Lee (of every Kevin Smith film but Clerks) the band rises, falls and faces reality as William grows up, looses he virginity (to three girls, including Anna Paquin, I think Crowe embellished a bit here?)  and falls in love with the lead guitarist favorite groupie/mistress/girlfriend, a self proclaimed Bandaide played to the hilt by the too-cute-for words Kate Hudson.The theatrical cut suffered from being too-long without enough character development and humor, this Longer version is better because it adds all the little things that hold a long film together. Simply put, it makes more sense and is more involving with the extra info.This is a watch it two-or-three times film where you can really notice different plot and character points with repeated viewings.

However, rumor of this ""Bootleg Cut""  kept me from purchasing the original.  When mom used to say ""patience is a virtue,"" this was one of those reasons to take her on her word!Writer/Producer/Director Cameron Crowe presents ""Almost Famous"" in it's original incarnation titled: ""Untitled!""  Yes, you heard right.  Crowe finally had the chance to insert the sequences that explained more of his characters, gave him a better piece of mind, and probably told things that wouldn't be understood by the audience (the film originally ran 2 hours long, and the 35 minutes that appear in ""Untitiled"" would probably make some squrim out of boredom in their seats).For those not sure of the film, here's the summary:  William Miller is a young man trapped in a family with an overbearing mother and her hope that one day, he will become a great lawyer.  But in actuality, William loves Rock and Roll, and he uses his love of music to write reviews and reports for several local and underground papers.  One day, Rolling Stone magazine gets ahold of his work, and asks William to do a story for them.  William then takes to the road with the up and coming band called ""Stillwater,"" where he meets the lead guitarist Russell Hammond(Billy Crudup), and even the infamous Penny Lane(Kate Hudson), a young girl who's the most enigmatic screen presence you may ever see.The extras that Crowe includes in this DVD set include audio commentary by himself and (possibly a first for an audio guest) his Mom!  She's very informative, and also helps keep the conversation lively.  There's also a longer cut of a scene featuring the band ""Still Water,"" as well as articles Crowe wrote for Rolling Stone in his youth (this film is actually a biopic of his life, with some fiction).  There is also a great interactive scene that requires you to have Led Zeppelin's ""Stairway to Heaven"" on audio, CD, Vinyl or any form you can get your hands on it.  Trust me, get a copy of ""Stairway"" if you get this DVD set. What it's for is a great scene that was cut because they couldn't get the copyright for the song.As an added bonus, there is a 6-song CD featuring the music written for the band ""Stillwater"" in the film.  Every single song is Excellent!  Not a bad one in the bunch.The set contains the original cut of the film on Disc 2, which is a great way to compare the cut for the big screen, and the true director's vision.The film has been known to off-put some people ( almost all my family didn't like it), but for those that like music, nostalgia, and a film that is really unlike what most people create or experience, this is a great set to get.",5,One of the greatest Director's cuts (and DVD sets) yet!,1011484800,"01 20, 2002",2002,2722,"['already', 'have', 'written', 'review', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'saw', 'earlier', 'part', '2001', 'However', 'rumor', 'Bootleg', 'Cut', 'kept', 'purchasing', 'original', 'When', 'mom', 'used', 'say', 'patience', 'virtue', 'was', 'one', 'reasons', 'take', 'word', 'Writer/Producer/Director', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'original', 'incarnation', 'titled', 'Untitled', 'Yes', 'heard', 'right', 'Crowe', 'finally', 'had', 'chance', 'insert', 'sequences', 'explained', 'more', 'characters', 'gave', 'better', 'piece', 'mind', 'probably', 'told', 'things', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'understood', 'audience', 'film', 'originally', 'ran', '2', 'hours', 'long', '35', 'minutes', 'appear', 'Untitiled', 'would', 'probably', 'make', 'squrim', 'boredom', 'seats', '.For', 'not', 'sure', 'film', 'here', 'summary', 'William', 'Miller', 'young', 'man', 'trapped', 'family', 'overbearing', 'mother', 'hope', 'one', 'day', 'will', 'become', 'great', 'lawyer', 'actuality', 'William', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'love', 'music', 'write', 'reviews', 'reports', 'several', 'local', 'underground', 'papers', 'One', 'day', 'Rolling', 'Stone', 'magazine', 'ahold', 'work', 'William', 'do', 'story', 'William', 'then', 'road', 'up', 'coming', 'band', 'called', 'Stillwater', 'where', 'lead', 'guitarist', 'Russell', 'Hammond', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'even', 'infamous', 'Penny', 'Lane', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'most', 'enigmatic', 'screen', 'presence', 'may', 'ever', 'see.The', 'extras', 'Crowe', 'DVD', 'set', 'include', 'audio', 'commentary', 'possibly', 'first', 'audio', 'guest', 'Mom', 'very', 'informative', 'also', 'keep', 'conversation', 'lively', 'also', 'longer', 'cut', 'scene', 'featuring', 'band', 'Still', 'Water', 'as', 'well', 'articles', 'Crowe', 'wrote', 'Rolling', 'Stone', 'youth', 'film', 'actually', 'biopic', 'life', 'fiction', 'also', 'great', 'interactive', 'scene', 'have', 'Led', 'Zeppelin', 'Stairway', 'Heaven', 'audio', 'CD', 'Vinyl', 'form', 'can', 'get', 'hands', 'Trust', 'get', 'copy', 'Stairway', 'get', 'DVD', 'set', 'What', 'great', 'scene', 'was', 'cut', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'copyright', 'song.As', 'added', 'bonus', '6-song', 'CD', 'featuring', 'music', 'written', 'band', 'Stillwater', 'film', 'single', 'song', 'Excellent', 'Not', 'bad', 'one', 'bunch.The', 'set', 'original', 'cut', 'film', 'Disc', '2', 'great', 'way', 'compare', 'cut', 'big', 'screen', 'true', 'director', 'vision.The', 'film', 'been', 'known', 'off-put', 'people', 'almost', 'family', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'music', 'nostalgia', 'film', 'really', 'what', 'most', 'people', 'create', 'experience', 'great', 'set', 'get']",Almost Famous

529030,A1JMQ88IMH0XJL,B00003CXMG,Mike,"[4, 4]","&quot;Almost Famous&quot; (2000)You may not know it, but Cameron Crowe - Almost Famous's director - is in love with music. Almost Famous is based on his experience with Led Zeppelin back in the 1970's, and it is a startling and amazing film that intrigued me with its developed characters and viewpoints of live in its set decade.Cameron Crowe is really getting on my good side. I loved Jerry Maguire, and thought it was one of the best films of 1996. Almost Famous is very different to Jerry Maguire, and I am thoroughly enjoying the way Crowe is changing his styles. He's done teen movies, romantic comedies and now Almost Famous is his tribute to music, that has a bit of everything - drama, funny and comical scenes and a mysterious romance. Crowe comes off as a natural in his directing department and his writing skills are even better. Crowe also wrote the film, and he shows true talent for bringing his stories to the screen.The acting in the movie is outstanding. It is headlined by a marvellous cast, including Billy Crudup, Kate Hudson, Jason Lee, Frances McDormand, Anna Paquin, Fairuza Balk and newcomer Patrick Fugit. Crudup and Lee are horribly underrated as actors. They gives a very realistic performance of band members struggling on the hard side of rock `n roll and still managing to party on and have a good time. McDormand is now one of my favourite actresses. She just has amazing on-screen presence. Fargo won her Oscar, this one gave her a nomination and in Wonder Boys her underwritten performance was very enjoyable. I strongly recommend seeing how this woman works. Fugit, the newcomer of the actors, is very human and sweet, however hard his character tries to be ""the enemy"", Fugit comes off as just a cutie on the edge of stardom. Hudson will be huge! Also starring in Gossip in 2000, Hudson pulls off a performance like no other actress this year. Her character is mischievous and mysterious, and Hudson is truly a perfectionist in her role. I couldn't imagine seeing anyone play Penny Lane better. Balk and Paquin are pretty much there just to look at, but they have some good scenes, especially Balk, who has a hilarious telephone conversation with William's (Fugit) mother. ""Is this Mary-Anne with the pot?""The chemistry between Fugit and Hudson is very believable. These two don't come across as 2 people who are meant to be together or anything on the outside, because one is a rock `n roll groupie and the other is a 15 year-old journalist, but because the script really allows you to go deep in Penny and William's souls, you see really these 2 would be hopeless lovers in real life. I'd love to see them do more work together.The Oscar nominated editing in the film is also a highpoint. The sequences in which the band perform use many techniques and extras to bring the concerts off as believable and exciting. The editing was used particularly in these scenes, but there are also little things you might notice too.To fully appreciate Almost Famous you have to at least like music a little, and I like music a lot. This movie worked for me on many levels, it had the power to engage me, I had lots of people to care about, and overall I just had a heck of a fun time.

529031,A27PSZX2SE0B51,B00003CXMG,Mike Stone,"[102, 113]","There's a moment early on in &quot;Untitled&quot;, Cameron Crowe's 'Bootleg' Director's Cut of &quot;Almost Famous&quot;, where rock critic Lester Bangs (Phillip Seymour Hoffman), in mid-rant, claims that the Box Tops' &quot;The Letter&quot; says more in less than two minutes, without even trying, than Jethro Tull can say in hours, while trying their damndest.  It got me thinking: why didn't Crowe take his own advice?  Why did he take a perfectly serviceable 122-minute movie that appeared to say everything, and turn it into a 162-minute movie?  Well, I've seen &quot;Untitled&quot;.  It blows up &quot;Almost Famous&quot;, makes it spectacle and spectacular, while never losing its intimate edge.This is a case where more of a good thing doesn't turn into too much of a good thing.What do you get with &quot;Untitled&quot;?  Well, more character.  Backstories are fleshed out, relationships are better defined, and the humanity becomes more human.  We see William's (Patrick Fugit) kleptomania, along with more examples of how his youth made him an outcast.  We get Penny Lane's (Kate Hudson) nurturing side, explicitly portrayed.  And we get a full-on glimpse of Jeff Bebe's (Jason Lee) envy, why it started and how it manifests itself.  A couple of full scenes are added, most notably a radio station appearance that's terribly funny, albeit irrelevant to the plot.  But most of the additional footage comes from existing scenes being lengthened.  More often than not, the point is clarified without boring the audience with tediousness.The audio commentary begins with Cameron Crowe outlining the two paths they might go down.  The first is the hemming-and-hawing path, where all the truths are covered up, in favour of banal stories and technical information.  The second path is the heart-on-your-sleeve path, where all the inspirations and backstories are owned up to, where mistakes are agonized over, and the truth is king.  If you've ever seen a Cameron Crowe movie, or heard the man speak more than two sentences, you'll know which path he chooses.Crowe dominates the track.  He's joined by a couple of execs (or PA's or something; they're never really introduced and don't say much).  But the real treat of the track is the inclusion of one Mrs. Alice Crowe, Cameron's mom (and Frances McDormand's doppelganger).  Besides being a doting mother, and quick to offer praise for her son, she also offers some real insights into the genesis of the film.  She appears to know the movie backwards and forwards, and acts as further proof of the film's accuracy.  It's amazing to see how much of the movie was really based on actual events.  Every scene appears to begin with either Cameron or Alice being taken aback by the memories it invokes.This is probably one of the best commentary tracks I've heard, for the inclusion, in equal measure, of technical information, on set anecdotes, and passion.Also included on Disc One is real life video footage of an interview with Lester Bangs.  Lester's vitriol is palpable, his menacing nature is enormous, but his warmth shines through.  It's an interesting tidbit, in that it offers further proof that Hoffman is one of the greatest actors working today, for he doesn't stoop to imitating Lester.  It's more like channeling.  Then, Cameron includes a list -- complete with fully-represented album covers -- of his top albums of 1973 (the year the film is set).  An interesting curiosity.  Some of the works actually inform specific scenes from the film, which is kind of a neat trick.  They've also put together a &quot;video&quot; for the Stillwater song &quot;Love Comes and Goes&quot;, which is basically a montage of behind-the-scenes moments from the Rock Camp the actors had to go through.  More of this can bee seen on &quot;B-Sides&quot;, another video montage.  Most interesting is the inclusion of seven of Crowe's Rolling Stone articles from the era, printed in their entirety.  It's not hard to see the nascent voice of Crowe the filmmaker shining through these passion-filled pieces.Disc Two has a lot less going for it.  Its main feature is the original theatrical version of the movie.  Also included is the full-length (15 minutes or so) Cleveland Concert, parts of which we see in the movie.  Despite the fact that Billy Crudup sometimes plays notes not actually in the songs, and that Jason Lee still has to work on his between song banter, this footage shows just how well the actors did in achieving their collective band persona.  The music's not that great, but the vibe, captured by on-stage camera work, is authentic.  The Production Notes section is basically the same essay you'll find in the box's liner notes, only with additional information.  There's an interesting little video moment, with Pete Droge and Elaine Summers singing &quot;Small Time Blues&quot; in a Hyatt House hotel room.  It's a moment quickly passed by in the actual movie.  But here you get to hear the whole song, from William's voyeuristic point-of-view, and it's just stunningly beautiful.  You can also scroll through Crowe's screenplay, peruse the cast and crew bios, and watch the theatrical trailer.Disc Three is an audio CD.  It's got the six Stillwater songs, written variously by Nancy Wilson, Cameron Crowe, and Peter Frampton, among others.  They're not very good songs, and I'm not sure they fit the era they're supposed to come from, but for an &quot;Almost Famous&quot; completist, like myself, it's neat to have them in all their (sub-)glory.A lot of effort was put into making this set look like a real bootleg, the kind of clandestine little document you'd pick up at a seedy record store.  I think the look and feel enhance the movie.  Which was pretty good to begin with.",5,&quot;Almost Famous&quot; DVDeserves This Loving &quot;Uncut&quot; Treatment,1026864000,"07 17, 2002",2002,5746,"['moment', 'early', 'quot', 'Untitled', 'quot',

I am too young to know anything about the 70's, and as the film mostly deals with teenagers, it would appear that it has no market.  Don't let that fool you, as this is one of the best movies of the year!It features star performances from Fugit as the young reporter and from McDormand as his mother.  It's also nice to see Fairuza Balk, such a greatly underrated actress.  The only remotely bad thing I could say about this movie is that Kate Hudson is not nearly as good as I had expected her to be.  She was still very good, just not as superb as I had been led to believe.Basically, although 'Almost Famous' deals with teens, it is far from your typical teen movie.  It raises questions of freedom and restriction alongside the failure of modern music to truly inspire any of us anymore (or that was the message I got anyway).  As William the young reporter leaves his home in hope of freedom, friendship and rock and roll, he slowly realises that this very world he's looking is being destroyed by the people he admires, attempting to overglorify themselves though... reporters.

Carnegie,"[10, 10]","Set in the early seventies and the time of endlessly touring British and American concept rock bands and told through the eyes of high school kid and wannabe rock journalist William Miller, the movie follows the lives of the up-and-coming fictionalised rock band Stillwater and one of their most special fans, Miss Penny Lane (the excellent Kate Hudson). Whether you were around in the seventies and remember this era (I wasn't and I don't) it is hard not to be moved be this rock odyssey as the band move from town to town, squabble to squabble and we watch William grow.This has everything you'd expect from a movie about a rock band, girls, drink, drugs, fighting and general excessive bad behaviour but it skilfully avoids ever falling into clich&eacute; because the characters here are not just rock stars or groupies, they are real people, with human weaknesses and human strengths. Crowe's writing and direction are both subtle and beguiling and he draws extraordinary performances out of all the main leads including Billy Crudup (as lead guitarist and charismatic star of Stillwater), Kate Hudson (as Penny Lane), young Patrick Fugit (as William) and great supporting turns from the finest young character alive at this moment, Philip Seymour Hoffman (as legendary rock journo. Lester Bangs) and Frances McDormand, as William's overprotective mother.I must admit to being a big fan of Cameron Crowe's work ever since seeing Say Anything and Jerry Maguire and unlike the, by all accounts, very disappointing Vanilla Sky, Almost Famous is up there with Crowe's finest work.

529052,A10X0JN8KTK89H,B00003CXMG,ninjasuperstar,"[1, 1]","I truly enjoyed this film, over-enjoyed it in fact.  There are far too many wonderful scenes, great joints of dialogue, and an overflow of brooding young men and women.  I felt like I had no character on which to focus my sympathy.  I wanted to focus on the perspective of the young writer, William Miller (played expertly by Patrick Fugit), but the film wouldn't let me.  I wanted to envision Russell Hammond (played genuinely by Billy Crudup), but I couldn't decide if he was a rock star, a little boy trapped in a man's body, or a surrogate father to William.  I didn't understand Kate Hudson's Oscar nomination, but I understood Frances McDormand's.  And why the hell Philip Seymour Hoffman wasn't nominated, I'll never understand.  Something was going on in this movie that confused me.I think the greatest flaw in this movie - the theatrical version, at least - is that there are simply too many great performances and too many fascinating characters for the film to center itself.  I'm positive that the director's cut is the version to see.  The theater cut was pieced together with an air of sadness in order to meet a marketable time limit.  I felt like I was missing a lot of back-story, supporting roles, and important moments.  If you have never seen this movie, avoid the theatrical version.  It is severely dismembered, and it's clear that the director (Cameron Crowe) had more to show the viewer.  The director's cut is over forty minutes longer, and I look forward to seeing it.I probably should at least attempt to place this movie.  The film covers the 1973-74 tours of the band Stillwater.  There were an actual band back then, but the majority of their representation is fabricated for the sake of the movie.  Most of the music in the film is representative of the time period and not so much from the band.  Thus, this is not a true biopic, but an imagined biopic, a movie about a band that was, as the title states, almost famous.",3,A Review of the Theatrical Version - please view the Director's Cut for a fuller experience,1180742400,"06 2, 2007",2007,1953,"['truly', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'over-enjoyed', 'fact', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'wonderful', 'scenes', 'great', 'joints', 'dialogue', 'overflow', 'brooding', 'young', 'men', 'women', 'felt', 'had', 'character', 'focus', 'sympathy', 'wanted', 'focus', 'perspective', 'young', 'writer', 'William', 'Miller', 'played', 'expertly', 'Patrick', 'Fugit', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'let', 'wanted', 'envision', 'Russell', 'Hammond', 'played', 'genuinely', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'could', ""n't"", 'decide', 'was', 'rock', 'star', 'little', 'boy', 'trapped', 'man', 'body', 'surrogate', 'father', 'William', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'understood', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'why', 'hell', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'was', ""n't"", 'nominated', ""'ll"", 'never', 'understand', 'Something', 'was', 'going', 'movie', 'confused', 'me.I', 'think', 'greatest', 'flaw', 'movie', 'theatrical', 'version', 'least', 'are', 'simply', 'too', 'many', 'great', 'performances', 'too', 'many', 'fascinating', 'characters', 'film', 'center', ""'m"", 'positive', 'director', 'cut', 'version', 'see', 'theater', 'cut', 'was', 'pieced', 'together', 'air', 'sadness', 'order', 'meet', 'marketable', 'time', 'limit', 'felt', 'was', 'missing', 'lot', 'back-story', 'supporting', 'roles', 'important', 'moments', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'movie', 'avoid', 'theatrical', 'version', 'severely', 'dismembered', 'clear', 'director', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'had', 'more', 'show', 'viewer', 'director', 'cut', 'forty', 'minutes', 'longer', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'it.I', 'probably', 'should', 'least', 'attempt', 'place', 'movie', 'film', '1973-74', 'tours', 'band', 'Stillwater', 'were', 'actual', 'band', 'back', 'then', 'majority', 'representation', 'fabricated', 'sake', 'movie', 'Most', 'music', 'film', 'representative', 'time', 'period', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'band', 'Thus', 'not', 'true', 'biopic', 'imagined', 'biopic', 'movie', 'band', 'was', 'title', 'states', 'almost', 'famous']",Almost Famous

Along the way he finds out about true friendship (and not so true), falls in love, and loses his virginity - all while trying to break free of his over-protective and worried sick mother. Kate Hudson plays Penny Lane, the gorgeous wild-child &quot;Band-Aid&quot; who steals the heart of William but has her own stolen by the self-centered guitarist of the band.This is a great movie - definitely one of my favorites of all time. Some say that it is losely based on the life of Cameron Crowe, who wrote the script and directed the movie.This director's edition bootleg cut is great to own - you get 2 discs (disc one is the movie with never before seen footage, an interview with Lester Bangs, behind the scenes footage, Cameron Crowe's top 10 albums of '73, and a music video; disc two is the special features disc which comes with Stillwaters Cleveland Concert, Deleted scenes with directors commentary, Oscar winning screenplay, theatrical trailer, production notes, cast &amp; crew info &amp; more) and it also comes with a Stillwater CD - songs of the band that you can take with you in the car!

And basing a film around the celebratedly outrageous Lester Bangs had to be a riot. Didn't it?Apparently not. Almost Famous doesn't even hint at some of the outrageous things which actually were going on in the rock scene at the time. Bangs is portrayed not as a odorous, loudmouthed, romilar-addicted wild-eyed preacher-man of rock journalism, but as an eccentric, slightly cranky uncle.What it boils down to it that this isn't a rock movie at all. It's a coming-of-age movie. It's about a 13 year old Cameron Crowe bluffing his way into writing for Rolling Stone. Now, that story *MIGHT* have been interesting if he'd decided to tell it straight - actually naming and shaming - but he doesn't. He wimps out by making up the characters and then double wimps out by making the characters dull. Stillwater - the fictional band at the heart of the action - are completely implausible as rock idols, having no streak of threat about them at all. They all wear brushed cotton shirts.If you ignore the cop-out plot headline, what you're left with is some silly treacly stuff between mother and son (not even Frances McDormand can save this one, having been given a stinker of a part as a college lecturer and highly-strung mom) and a highly improbable, depressingly sanitised sub-plot about a sixteen year old groupie who doesn't *do* it.Good one, Cameron.If you want a coming-of-age movie, watch River Phoenix in Stand By Me. If you want a rock 'n' roll spoof, then there's still only one contender - This is Spinal Tap.

I just wanted the film to keep going and going. But, sadly, it had to end. It's an amazing experience that will go down in film history forever. It has an amazing cast and amazing story. It's hilarious and sad at the same time.The story follows a young journalist's attempt for fame and recognition. He finally catches his break when Rolling Stone stumbles upon his writing and decides to give him a chance. His assignment: To write a story about Stillwater, the band he recently befriended.The movie really has some amazing performances. Phillip Seymour Hoffman has an incredible supporting role. It really is one of his best performances of his career. It's very memorable. Billy Crudup, has the best performance of his career, as the troubled guitarist of the band Stillwater. Frances McDormand and Kate Hudson both have amazing roles. Patrick Fugit, William Miller, has the best performance as the troubled young journalist. The supporting cast is also very good. It includes: Jason Lee, Anna Paquin, Jimmy Fallon, and Noah Taylor.The direction and writing of Cameron Crowe, are both flawless. That's basically all you can say about it. It's brilliantly done.Also, if you can, buy a copy of the Untitled addition. It is OOP, out of print, but if you can find a used copy, buy it.

It is on the level of American Beauty for me. It just has sense to it that makes it a good movie, and it's just pure fun!William is a 15 year old who wants to become a critic and he catches up with a rock n roll band StillWater and travels with them while he talks with his mom and she gives him details to not take drugs. And he gets a deal with Rolling Stone and fools them into thinking he's married and is in his 20s. SO he gets caught up in a friendship with guitarist Russ, and the band seems to always be fighting and Russ is sleeping with Penny, who claims she is a band-aid not a groupie. And William tries to cope when he looses his virginity and  tries to get his story by the deadline and make StillWater look like the best band in the world, while they get a new manager and almost get killed in an airplane in a electrical storm. And Penny tries to kill herself after Russ introduces his wife to her, and that is when William tells Penny that he is in love with her. Then the band tells Rolling Stone that the story William is trying to get published is 98% lies. So William goes home and the band is about to break up when Russ confirms that every word of the review was true. And Russ tries to talk to Penny and get her Address so they can meet and make things right, and PEnny ends up giving Russ Williams address instead.

529060,AWFPO0SDMD4QR,B00003CXMG,Paul,"[7, 8]","Myself, like many others, counted down the days until March 13th arrived.  Cameron Crowes &quot;Almost Famous&quot; has reassured me that this talanted director creates films unlike all others.  There is always SOMETHING unique about every movie this man has been a part of.  With Almost Famous, I had a constant 2-hour smile on my face, at the same time remembering a bunch of adolescent memories like my first girlfriend, my first kiss, the first time I got to experience real freedom away from home.  And I am sure I'm not alone here, because what made this film so wonderful is that it has provoked similar memories in those that saw this wonderful film.  OK, let's talk about this DVD.  As soon as I received mine, I immediately looked on the back for the 'extra features.'  Let me make this clear before I start my review, there is NO COMMENTARY and there is NO 30 MINUTES OF EXTRA FOOTAGE.  From what I hear, Cameron Crowe was too busy working on his next film to spend time on this DVD release.  So, I'm expecting a FUTURE release of this film with all those extras many of us were hoping for.  However, I DO recommend getting this DVD in its current state, because simply, it's just a GREAT film!  OK...NOW back to the DVD.  I opened the case up and was introduced to an attractive looking DVD with a picture of the cast on the DVD.  The pamphlet inside is nothing special.  It has 3 behind-the-scenes photos and a little background on the making of the film.  It also has chapter listings.  I popped the DVD into my player and was pleasantly surprised by the menu design, very easy navigation with eye popping moving menus and colors, all displayed with the background music of Stillwater.  The 'main menu' has a choice of 'special features', 'scene index',  'audio options' and 'subtitles'.  Under 'special features', you have the choice of watching an HBO special on the making of Almost Famous, the theatrical trailer and the &quot;Fever Dog&quot; music video.  You can also view production notes, cast and crew biographies and Rolling Stone articles written by the director.  The &quot;Making Of&quot; special is a nice look into the film, with interviews by many cast members.  Nothing we haven't seen before, but still nice to have.  The &quot;Fever Dog&quot; video is pretty bad.  Yes, it contains a few cuts not seen in the film, but 3/4 of it seems out of sync.  (I'm an editor, I notice stuff like this).  The whole video resembled an old 'Godzilla' TV show after a while....oh well.  The 'scene index' is wonderful.  It has a title for each scene and moving menus which create a very attractive screen.  You have 3 'audio options'.  DTS Digital Surround, 5.1 Dolby Digital and 2.0 Dolby Digital.  You also have a choice of having English 'subtitles' on or off.  My favorite 'special feature' were the articles written by Cameron Crowe.  Reading these articles makes you realize what a terrific writer Cameron Crowe is, and how much of a pleasure it must be to read his scripts.  OK....now to the technical stuff about the movie. I was very VERY impressed with this beautiful anamorphic widescreen transfer.  The cinematography in this film is wonderful.  Colors are beautifully rendered, blacks are rich and the concert footage is gorgeous.  No complaints about picture quality, it is excellent.  The audio is also wonderful.  Although the dialogue is pretty much center channeled, the movie sounds far from monaural.  Ambience sounds are surrounding and the music is outstanding.  If you watch this on a surround system, the concert footage will envelope your ears and bring you right into the show.  I was even impressed with the audio on a 2 speaker system.  Your subwoofer will kick in during the concert footage, other then that, this film is not one to test your system out.  Having the dialogue strictly centered makes the concert footage EXPLODE!  The sound design is terrific, clean, clear and beautifully recorded.  (Yes, I found myself singing Tiny Dancer.....again!)  In conclusion, Almost Famous is one of my favorite films from the past few years.  It's full of emotion and PERFECTLY casted with wonderful performance from all involved.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this DVD.  I give the film 5 stars, but the DVD loses a star for lacking the footage we were all hoping for.  Go get this DVD if you want to smile  for 2 hours straight.

529061,A1GN8UJIZLCA59,B00003CXMG,P Magnum,"[0, 0]","The main character in Almost Famous is a 15 year old rock journalist named William Miller. He gets the chance to write an article for Rolling Stone magazine about an up and coming rock band, Stillwater. He goes out on tour with the band and what starts out as a simple assignment, turns into a life altering experience for all involved. The character of William is director and writer Cameron Crowe's on screen alter ego. Mr. Crowe was a 15 year old who wrote for Rolling Stone and the story is based on his life. The film also involves William's overprotective and aggressive mother (played by Frances McDormand) and the battles she waged with his sister. They are based on Mr. Crowe's own family's struggles and the fact that he was willing to air his family's problems in public adds a touch of humanity and reality to the film. Stillwater is led by Jeff Bebe and Russell Hammond who bicker at one another about the band's future and possible fame. Billy Crudup plays Russell the lead guitarist and Jason Lee is Jeff the lead singer. They have a natural fear of the press and refer to William as the enemy. In fact, William struggles to get an one on one interview with Russell throughout the film. The band is followed on tour by a bunch of groupies who refer to themselves as Band-Aids. Their leader is Penny Lane played wonderfully by Kate Hudson. She is in love with Russell, but it is William whom she confides in. The tender relationship between Penny &amp; William is one of the film's great strengths. Throughout the film, William seeks and gets advice from legendary rock critic Lester Bangs. Mr. Bangs is played amazingly by Philip Seymour Hoffman. Mr. Hoffman provides the film's conscious and his brief time on the screen is electric. All the performances in the film are first-rate including Ms. Hudson who is luminous, Mr. Crudup is brooding and dark, Mr. Lee is self-righteous and Ms. McDormand is a fierce presence. But the most startling performance is that of Patrick Fugit as William. Mr. Fugit had never appeared in a movie before and had minimal acting experience, but he is the emotional center of the film, the link between al the characters. He plays William perfectly and captures the essence of what Mr. Crowe was trying to capture. Mr. Crowe guides the film with an eye for detail as the sets and feeling are completely real and harkens the spirit of the 70's. His screenplay perfectly balances drama and comedy and has some of the sharpest dialogue in a long time. Mr. Crowe took home a Best Original Screenplay Oscar at the 2000 Academy Awards for this great script. Almost Famous is Mr. Crowe's love letter to his youth and the 70's. The film is easily his most personal, but it is the personal touch he adds that gives the film its universal appeal.  This is an expanded three disk DVD that has everything one could want regarding the film including a disk of Stillwater's live performance that was filmed for the movie and vintage Cameron Crowe Rolling Stone work.  The DVD is as expansive as any released and worth the few extra bucks.",5,Crowe's Life,1007683200,"12 7, 2001",2001,3071,"['main', 'character', 'Almost', 'Famous', '15', 'year', 'old', 'rock', 'journalist', 'named', 'William', 'Miller', 'chance', 'write', 'article', 'Rolling', 'Stone', 'magazine', 'up', 'coming', 'rock', 'band', 'Stillwater', 'out', 'tour', 'band', 'what', 'out', 'simple', 'assignment', 'life', 'altering', 'experience', 'involved', 'character', 'William', 'director', 'writer', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'screen', 'alter', 'ego', 'Mr.', 'Crowe', 'was', '15', 'year', 'old', 'who', 'wrote', 'Rolling', 'Stone', 'story', 'based', 'life', 'film', 'also', 'William', 'overprotective', 'aggressive', 'mother', 'played', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'battles', 'waged', 'sister', 'are', 'based', 'Mr.', 'Crowe', 'own', 'family', 'struggles', 'fact', 'was', 'willing', 'air', 'family', 'problems', 'public', 'touch', 'humanity', 'reality', 'film', 'Stillwater', 'led', 'Jeff', 'Bebe', 'Russell', 'Hammond', 'who', 'bicker', 'one', 'band', 'future', 'possible', 'fame', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'Russell', 'lead', 'guitarist', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'Jeff', 'lead', 'singer', 'have', 'natural', 'fear', 'press', 'refer', 'William', 'enemy', 'fact', 'William', 'get', 'one', 'one', 'interview', 'Russell', 'film', 'band', 'followed', 'tour', 'bunch', 'groupies', 'who', 'refer', 'Band-Aids', 'leader', 'Penny', 'Lane', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'love', 'Russell', 'William', 'whom', 'tender', 'relationship', 'Penny', 'amp', 'William', 'one', 'film', 'great', 'strengths', 'film', 'William', 'advice', 'legendary', 'rock', 'critic', 'Lester', 'Bangs', 'Mr.', 'Bangs', 'played', 'amazingly', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'Mr.', 'Hoffman', 'film', 'conscious', 'brief', 'time', 'screen', 'electric', 'performances', 'film', 'are', 'first-rate', 'including', 'Ms.', 'Hudson', 'who', 'luminous', 'Mr.', 'Crudup', 'brooding', 'dark', 'Mr.', 'Lee', 'self-righteous', 'Ms.', 'McDormand', 'fierce', 'presence', 'most', 'startling', 'performance', 'Patrick', 'Fugit', 'William', 'Mr.', 'Fugit', 'had', 'never', 'appeared', 'movie', 'had', 'minimal', 'acting', 'experience', 'emotional', 'center', 'film', 'link', 'characters', 'William', 'perfectly', 'essence', 'what', 'Mr.', 'Crowe', 'was', 'trying', 'capture', 'Mr.', 'Crowe', 'film', 'eye', 'detail', 'sets', 'feeling', 'are', 'completely', 'real', 'spirit', '70', 'screenplay', 'perfectly', 'drama', 'comedy', 'sharpest', 'dialogue', 'long', 'time', 'Mr.', 'Crowe', 'took', 'home', 'Best', 'Original', 'Screenplay', 'Oscar', '2000', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'great', 'script', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'Mr.', 'Crowe', 'love', 'letter', 'youth', '70', 'film', 'easily', 'most', 'personal', 'personal', 'touch', 'film', 'universal', 'appeal', 'expanded', 'three', 'disk', 'DVD', 'everything', 'one', 'could', 'want', 'regarding', 'film', 'including', 'disk', 'Stillwater', 'live', 'performance', 'was', 'filmed', 'movie', 'vintage', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'Rolling', 'Stone', 'work', 'DVD', 'as', 'expansive', 'released', 'few', 'extra', 'bucks']",Almost Famous

Some of my favorite movies are Tootsie, Casablanca, Broadcast News, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and Say Anything.  So you can tell that I'm not a cult movie freak (I like Chasing Amy, Fletch, Slapshot, etc.) or a classics junkie (Citizen Kane and Gone with the Wind are overrated.), but a true believer in good cinema.  That being said, I'm a Cameron Crowe fan.  You know where I place  Say Anything.  I loved the cast of Singles and thought it was hilarious (Xavier McDaniel's line is my favorite.).  I saw Jerry Maguire with my wife at the movies when we were dating and I don't think I've ever left the theater feeling better.  Almost Famous, however, didn't quite measure up to my expectations.  It seemed too choppy, the characters underdeveloped, and when it was over, I didn't feel like I wanted to hang out with the people I'd just spent about 90 minutes getting to know.  But I'd heard good things about the fresh cut on the Untitled DVD, that it was the version CC wanted us to see, but the studio wouldn't let him release it.  Something about a 2 hour and 45 minute comedy being too long.  Anyway, I bought the disc and let me say that it is his best work.  Right up there with Say Anything. The extra 45 minutes add the chocolate chips to the bland cookie that was Almost Famous.  Now you will feel as if you are on tour with the band,  why William feels like his school hates him, and how much he cares about Penny Lane.  See this version.  Then watch it again while listening to the hilarious mother/son commentary by Cameron Crowe and his MOTHER.  If you're like me, you were disappointed in Almost Famous after Jerry Maguire.

If I hear, &quot;You had me at hello,&quot; again, I'll scream) did not overdo it here.  Crowe tells his story--pours his heart out on film, and does it with respect to his then profession--Journalism--and the rock scene of that time. Here, he takes the rock immortals and make them mortal and flawed. He kindly views the groupies--band-aids--as girls attached body and soul to musicians and their art and not as sexual intruments.  Each scene is emotional, but we're too captivated by all that we witness that we too surrender to it. In the end, it feels as if we went through a journey of profound wonder that just like the main character, we see the world as it really is--human. Rock stars--human. Groupies--human.

529067,A1LDIMQISH07WK,B00003CXMG,Rebecca,"[0, 2]","ALMOST FAMOUS is truly the greatest film ever made. I wanted desperately to see this ever since I saw the trailer. I never even knew I'd enjoy this kind of film. After all, me...a 17-year-old who doesn't normally like rock 'n' roll but a teen Pop fanatic who loves the Backstreet Boys instead of Led Zeppelin loved this film! So it doesn't really matter if you are not a huge fan of rock 'n' roll or lived in the 70s.Anyway, this is a feel-good, smart comedy that takes place in 1973. It's roughly about director/writer Cameron Crowe's life as a 15-year-old rock journalist. William Miller (Patrick Fugit) is an extremely smart young teenager who, even though he is only fifteen, is a senior in high school. William lives in San Diego with his hard, strict, down-to-earth mother, Elaine Miller (Frances McDormand), a college professor who can't seemed to understand why her children like rock music and stuff. He also lives with his older sister, Anita Miller (Zooey Deschanel), who is rebelious and decides to leave home so she can have more freedom.William's love for rock music urges him to become interested in journalism, and soon he meets the editor of Creem magazine, Lester Bangs (Philip Seymour Hoffman) who starts giving him tips on being a good rock journalist. Then Lester gives William an assignment: get an interview from the rock band, Black Sabbeth. William manages to get his reluclent mother to let him do this, and he goes to the Black Sabbeth concert. When that doesn't work, the band Stillwater shows up late for the concert since they are the opening act. William manages to get an interview from them instead by showing off his intelligence. Finally, Rolling Stone magazine calls William and asks him to do an interview with Stillwater, which takes him on an incredible journey-experience with Stillwater, where he eventually becomes friends with the band, especially close to the band's lead guitarist, Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup), and the beautiful, but mysterious &quot;band aid&quot; follower, Penny Lane (Kate Hudson).ALMOST FAMOUS has humor in it's own right. The cleaver, original script and screenplay is only a part of this masterpiece. The actors are a large piece of the masterpiece - the chemistry between all the actors is the thing that holds this film together. All the actors are perfect for their roles - from Patrick Fugit, who is a truly gifted actor, to Jason Lee, who plays the lead singer for Stillwater. I am ashamed that this film was, for the most part, over-looked by the Academy for Best Picture. I was glad that ALMOST FAMOUS won Best Original Screenplay, which it deserved, but it should have won more Awards.

The fictional band Stillwater have some great early 70s tunes that really take you back (or take you there, depending on how old you are...).But it's also worth watching even if you hate all that kind of thing. Almost famous is really an exploration of the meaning of friendship. In a rock-tour world where every relationship is as shallow as a one night stand, William unwittingly shows what real friendship can be, and calls those around him to live up to the best in themselves.

That is, unless they include great dialogue, comedy and drama, top-notch performances and a fantastic soundtrack. And that's exactly what multiple Oscar nominee ""Almost Famous"" has going for it. Of course, the fact that the main character lives out my dream of touring with a rock band doesn't hurt, either.""Almost Famous"" takes place during the early '70s, an era when rock legends such as Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath and The Who were in their prime. It's into this milieu that William Miller (Patrick Fugit), an earnest 15-year-old, finds himself thrust when he scores a Rolling Stone magazine assignment to cover a rising rock band called Stillwater. Against the odds, Fugit works his way into the inner circle of the band, initially winning their respect through his knowledge of their music.What begins as a short assignment turns into a multiple-month odyssey during which Patrick follows the band as it tours and grows from a second-tier rock group into superstars. Several compelling relationships develop along the way, including a unique friendship between William and the band's guitarist, Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup), and a touching bond between William and Penny Lane (Kate Hudson), a Stillwater groupie who prefers to be referred to as a Band-Aid. As dissension brews and excess rages within the band, Patrick is faced with a difficult decision: tell the band's real story and sell-out its members, or write a powder-puff boring article that might end his journalistic career.If the characters and their relationships with one another seem startlingly real in ""Almost Famous,"" that's because director/screenwriter Cameron Crowe (""Say Anything,"" ""Jerry Maguire"") based the story on his own experiences. As a result, Crowe gets every little detail right, from the band interactions to family dynamics to the music itself, to the point where you may start wondering whether this Stillwater band is real or fiction. Was ""Almost Famous"" robbed of a Best Picture nomination? You bet your a--.The brilliant ensemble cast wonderfully compliments Crowe's razor-sharp writing skills. In the lead role, the underrated Fugit is utterly believable. Academy Award nominee Hudson gives a performance that's simultaneously sexy, strong and vulnerable. Crudup is by turns obnoxious, kind, egotistical and funny. And Jason Lee again showcases his fine comic touch as Stillwater's lead singer, especially when he attacks Russell for hogging too much of the limelight: ""I'm the frontman, and you're the guitarist with mystique!""The best movies often draw you into their world and allow you to share their characters' fears, loves, sadness and joy. In ""Almost Famous,"" we share William's exhilaration as he lives the life of a rock star, and his sadness as he experiences the darker side of life and love. Ultimately, William loses his innocence, but manages to maintain his hopefulness.

I recall having a smile from ear to ear when watching that moment, and I cannot wait to see it again.  The film, taken from director Cameron Crowe's own experience as a teen journalist for Rolling Stone, centers around the day to day events on the road of a fictitious(?)rock band called Stillwater as seen through eyes of a budding 15 year old writer.  Almost Famous documents, in hearwarming detail, the crazy, almost surreal, aspects of the rock and roll lifestyle in the early 70's.  The parties.  The drugs.  The egos.  What I found most interesting was how the movie explored the relationship between journalist and celebrity and how one feeds off of and uses the other and vice versa.  Crowe, however, is too good of a writer/director to let his film fall into cynicism which it never does.

This is a wonderful, sensitive film that develops a number of themes:  finding a mentor, making your first foray into the world, discovering what (relative) failures most of us are as people, and of course, the decline of rock in the 1970s.  Not only was the psychology of the characters subtle and realistic, but the evocation of the time - when the 60s idealism gave way to crass commercialism and, well, genuine mediocrity - is vivid and accurate.I am almost the exact same age as the protagonist, so I identified with him on many levels:  rebelling against a parent he loved to go his own way, accomplishing something original by getting inside with his own talent and gall, and seeing the people behind the idols of cool.

529078,AW3FTPCBPVQNB,B00003CXMG,Robert J. Schneider,"[5, 5]","This is one of those rare films that brings you right back into the 1970's. I was just a kid in that decade, but I saw older kids and younger adults who looked and talked like some of the characters in this film, so the *feel* of the '70's just came back to me as I watched. The excitement, the decadence, the long hair and beards, the earth shoes, and the great rock 'n' roll music that was as thick in the air as the smoke; it was all there in front of me, but somehow most of it eluded me. As a member of 'Generation X', I missed out on all that fun--but also all the excess, the drugs, and the social sicknesses that defined the 'Me Decade'.This film has all of the above, but this is not merely a time warp.  It tells the story of how a repressed, yearning young boy became inspired to become a rock 'n' roll writer--at the tender age of 15 years old. It made me wish that I had pursued my dreams at that age! Based on writer-director Cameron Crowe's own life, the story of the adventures of young William Miller (played to innocent man-child perfection by Patrick Fugit), as he follows the fictional hard-rock band Stillwater during their romps with groupies, prostitutes, and assorted druggies, held my attention from beginning to end. It made me realize that my life may not have been all fun-and-games even if I HAD pursued my dreams in my teens!The reason why ALMOST FAMOUS is so wonderful? Let's begin with the excellent, and informative, writing from the pen of Cameron Crowe, who saw it all at such a tender young age. Let's continue on with the well-fleshed-out characters, who are so real and yet always seem to have that magical way of revealing something about themselves in nearly everything they say. Let's conclude with the always-compelling story, which has many twists and turns, yet never feels contrived.All in all, this film has it all.  Besides the brilliant low-key starring debut of Patrick Fugit, we have a wonderful, fully-realized performance from Billy Crudup (one of the best actors of his generation; look for his first Oscar within the next three years) as ""golden god"" lead guitarist Russell Hammond, who perhaps single-handedly personifies the various changes, and the vices, of the '70's.  Also impressive is the realistic performance of egotistical lead singer Jeff Bebe by Jason Lee.  Of course, no review of ALMOST FAMOUS would be complete without mentioning the star-making performance of Goldie Hawn's beautiful progeny, Kate Hudson, in an extremely well-realized performance as the ultimate rock groupie, Penny Lane.

529080,A1CGF9EUDEUQJA,B00003CXMG,Rodrigo Medina,"[5, 6]","Almost Famous is an autobiographical movie, based on Cameron Crowe memories. It is a story about a naive boy (William Miller) who has the most exciting experience of his life when he is given the chance to cover the US tour of a new band, stillwater, for Rolling Stone magazine. During this trip, William becomes more mature and aware of what happens on rock shows backstages, which represents a new world to him. Doing his job, he mets some &quot;groupie&quot; girls, who belong to music bands universe and make this film even better.The soundtrack is great and the characters have complex plots. The cast was very well chosen, and the best performers in scene are Kate Hudson, as the crazy groupie &quot;penny lane&quot;, and Philip Seymour Hoffman, who has a small part, but does it extremely well, as always.Frances McDormand is also great as William's repressive mother. Most part of the film she is worried with her son, and the influence sex, drugs and rock'n roll may cause in his teenage life.This movie has memorable moments, such as the dialogs between &quot;penny lane&quot; and william, and the airplane scene, when the stillwater, the groupies and even william start confessing their sins. I also enjoyed the &quot;groupies girls&quot;. Actually I know a few girls like that, which follow some local bands in my country and behave the same way as the characters of this film. Really unbelievable nowadays! I will never understand what makes these girls so devoted to group members and why they need to follow them and enjoy the sucess they do not deserve. It's kind of depressing, if you consider they have very low self steem, getting envolved with everybody in the bands.This DVD also brings HBO Behind the scenes, which I really recommend. In order to fully understand this movie, it is necessary to watch this special, in which Cameron Crowe reveals how autobiographical this film is, showing real pictures he took with rock stars on the 70's and also telling us about his early days experiences at show backstages.As over 150 critics agreed: Almost Famous is one of the top 10 films of the year!",4,a movie you won't forget,984700800,"03 16, 2001",2001,2114,"['Almost', 'Famous', 'autobiographical', 'movie', 'based', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'memories', 'story', 'naive', 'boy', 'William', 'Miller', 'who', 'most', 'exciting', 'experience', 'life', 'when', 'given', 'chance', 'cover', 'US', 'tour', 'new', 'band', 'stillwater', 'Rolling', 'Stone', 'magazine', 'trip', 'William', 'more', 'mature', 'aware', 'what', 'rock', 'shows', 'backstages', 'new', 'world', 'Doing', 'job', 'quot', 'quot', 'girls', 'who', 'belong', 'music', 'bands', 'universe', 'make', 'film', 'even', 'better.The', 'soundtrack', 'great', 'characters', 'have', 'complex', 'plots', 'cast', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'chosen', 'best', 'performers', 'scene', 'are', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'crazy', 'groupie', 'quot', 'lane', 'quot', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'who', 'small', 'part', 'extremely', 'well', 'always.Frances', 'McDormand', 'also', 'great', 'William', 'repressive', 'mother', 'Most', 'part', 'film', 'worried', 'son', 'influence', 'sex', 'drugs', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'may', 'cause', 'teenage', 'life.This', 'movie', 'memorable', 'moments', 'such', 'dialogs', 'quot', 'lane', 'quot', 'william', 'airplane', 'scene', 'when', 'stillwater', 'groupies', 'even', 'william', 'start', 'confessing', 'sins', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'quot', 'groupies', 'girls', 'quot', 'Actually', 'know', 'few', 'girls', 'follow', 'local', 'bands', 'country', 'behave', 'same', 'way', 'characters', 'film', 'Really', 'unbelievable', 'nowadays', 'will', 'never', 'understand', 'what', 'girls', 'so', 'devoted', 'group', 'members', 'why', 'need', 'follow', 'enjoy', 'sucess', 'do', 'not', 'deserve', 'kind', 'depressing', 'consider', 'have', 'very', 'low', 'self', 'steem', 'getting', 'envolved', 'everybody', 'bands.This', 'DVD', 'also', 'HBO', 'scenes', 'really', 'recommend', 'order', 'fully', 'understand', 'movie', 'necessary', 'watch', 'special', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'how', 'autobiographical', 'film', 'showing', 'real', 'pictures', 'took', 'rock', 'stars', '70', 'also', 'telling', 'early', 'days', 'experiences', 'show', 'backstages.As', '150', 'critics', 'agreed', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'one', 'top', '10', 'films', 'year']",Almost Famous
529081,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00003CXMG,Roland E. Zwick,"[4, 5]","What makes ""Almost Famous"" so much fun to watch is that it manages to capture a glimpse of the pop culture past without ever becoming heavy-handed, precious or sanctimonious in the process.  It clearly loves the rock music world it is exploring, yet the film is also clear-eyed enough to see that strange subculture in its totality - warts and all.  As he did in ""Jerry Maguire,"" writer/director Cameron Crowe shows himself to be a master at mixing disparate moods and exploring universal truths within the context of a light romantic comedy.Based on Crowe's own experiences as a teenaged rock journalist, ""Almost Famous"" tells the unusual story of a 15-year old writer named William Miller who finds himself composing a behind-the-scenes article for ""Rolling Stone"" on an up-and-coming rock band called Stillwater.  As a part of the tour, William is privy to all the backstage shenanigans, interpersonal conflicts and free-living excesses that are an integral and inevitable part of any rock band's existence.  William sees firsthand the conflicts that arise when one band member seems to be rising in prominence and popularity often at the expense of his band mates who can but look on in jealousy and wonder.  William also observes how fame, fortune and recognition often require a compromising of both artistic integrity and the musical purity that made the members want to be rock stars in the first place.  Like all the members of the team, as well as the hangers-on, groupies and roadies, William is drawn to rock and roll because it speaks to some indefinable need in his soul - yet, he also learns, through observation, that much of the glamour is really a cover for the insecurities and emotional emptiness of the individuals who comprise this strange, life-in-the-fast-lane world.Yet, all this makes ""Almost Famous"" sound dark and preachy - which it definitely is not.  On the contrary, Crowe keeps the proceedings light, airy and fast-paced thanks to the fact that William himself always remains such a clear-eyed, steady and likable young man.  William is the anchor that helps keep Crowe's movie real.  This wide-eyed fifteen year old seems far more mature and emotionally grounded than all the older people he is involved with.  These include the band's handsome lead guitarist, Russell Hammond, and a beautiful, sweet and radiant ""band-aid"" named ""Penny Lane.""  As Penny, Kate Hudson literally lights up the screen with warmth, sincerity and vulnerability every time she appears in a scene.  She is truly a natural.  The same can be said for young Patrick Fugit who never hits a false note as William, making him a character the audience can identify with from first moment to last.  Billy Crudup conveys just the right combination of arrogance and good-natured insecurity to make Russell a complex and believable individual.  And the wonderful Frances McDormand steals every scene she is in as William's fretful, up-tight, but obviously loving mother, who can do little but stand back in open-mouthed astonishment, aghast at the ""immoral"" lifestyle of the people who have ""kidnapped"" her child.  Yet, at the same time, something about her child makes her trust that, when the temptations come fast and furious, his innate moral strength - the strength she has imparted to him - will triumph in the end.  Thus, she reluctantly and anxiously allows him to fulfill his dream.Lovers of early `70's ""classic"" rock will adore the sound, the look and the general time capsule feel of the film.  Crowe has gotten all the ""accoutrements"" of the period absolutely right - from the shaggy hair, to the frenzied concerts, to the casual drug usage to the familiar tunes playing on the soundtrack.  ""Almost Famous"" is a movie to relax into, especially if you yourself came of age in that era.  It will gently carry you back to a past that seems both terribly recent and painfully long ago all at the same time.

529082,A2UR0J92JAR2TW,B00003CXMG,"Roman Martel ""R. Martel""","[0, 0]","The film captures the early 70's in lovely tint of nostalgia.  Everything from clothes, to dialogue feels authentic.  Adding to this is the excellent musical selections.  Not only do they fit the period, but they tie into the movie as well.Acting is solid all around.  Patrick Fugit inhabits the character of William Miller.  How much of the performance is based on Cameron Crowe, and how much is truly Miller, the world may never know.  It doesn't matter, he does a great job.  Billy Crudup delivers as Russell Hammond.  He's at times likable, annoying, and cruel (even if he doesn't know it).  In the end we like Russell, but we also want to have Elaine beat him upside the head a few times.  I'm not a huge fan of Kate Hudson, but she does a great job as Penny Lane.  It's still my favorite part she's played, and I think she'll have a hard time topping it.  The supporting cast is equally good, with Francis McDormand nearly stealing every scene she's in.Cameron Crowe's film is more than a little autobiographical.  The script does glorify the time period at times, but it never harms the film.  Instead it gives the viewer a cozy feeling.  The ending is never really in doubt, but the journey is what makes it work.  Crow's direction is solid and involving.This is one entertaining movie.  It skillfully combines comedy, romance, drama and nostalgia, balancing the mixture perfectly.  Any fans of music or coming of age stories will find plenty to enjoy here.  The theatrical cut seems a little too light at times, but the longer version (called ""Untitled"" by the director, and currently out of print) is more gritty and delivers a more satisfying film.

529083,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B00003CXMG,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[0, 0]","""Almost Famous"" is a sort of riff on Director Cameron Crowe's early years reporting for Rolling Stone.  You don't have to be a rock enthusiast to enjoy its sweetness.  Set in the early 1970's, when rock was drenched in a sort of easy-going, sun dried, alcohol and drug-fueled haze, and teenagers across America worshipped at the altar of Led Zeppelin with a fervor thought reserved by Star Trek fans, it tells the story of William Miller, a high-schooler trying to become a Rock N' Roll Journalist.  Preternaturally mature (by age 11, he's in the same class as 13 year olds, and they still hate him), and sheltered at home by a lovingly domineering mother (superb Frances Mcdormand), William falls in love with Rock yet is less determined to become a rocker himself than follow in the footsteps of  the legendary Lester Bangs, the self-appointed Dean of Rock Criticism.  Getting his first break writing for Bangs's ""Creem"" magazine, Miller gets his big break when he's tagged by Rolling Stone to cover the burgeoning band ""Stillwater"" on its ""Almost Famous '73"" tour.  Bangs remains ever present mentoring Miller through the process of covering the fast-rising band, an endeavor that requires Miller to remain aloof and objective, but not so distant that the band's suspicious members won't shun him as ""the enemy"".  Despite her better instincts, and on Miller's oath that he won't miss high-school graduation, Miller's mother allows the boy to go on tour with Stillwater, a fictional band loosely hinting such 70's confabs as Credence, the Allman Brothers and the Eagles.  A steady stream of sex with the band's dedicated groupies (called ""Band-aids"", young girls with fake names who insist that they're there for the music) and various feuds between band members helps to occupy Stillwater's principals, and frustrate Miller's attempts to get the band to say anything coherent on tape.  Too sweet (or uncool) to be insistent, Miller follows the band across America, watching self-imposed deadlines come and go.  Adding to Miller's stress is his own burgeoning love for Band-Aid in-chief, ""Penny Lane"" (Kate Hudson), whose adoration for Russel Hammond (Crudup), Stillwater Lead Guitar, blinds her to how the band uses its groupies.""Almost"" is a great movie, one of those understated gems from director Cameron Crowe. Though an anthem to 70's rock fandom, the film excels on its characters -  Stillwater's lead vocalist's pompous platitudes on the significance of Rock, Crudup's acid-induced meanderings at a party he crashes in Topeka, Phillip-Seymour Hoffman as the sage Bangs and especially Macdormand.  Like a band, the film excels not only on solo acts but also on how the characters impact each other - the look on the Topeka partygoers or (in one of the flick's running gags) the look on the faces of hotel workers who have to take messages from Miller's mother, or the lecture that Hammond receives from Mrs. Miller herself.

Cameron Crowe has led a fascinating life and now enjoys an exceptional career in film.  This movie and the stories written about it, allow you to see that the influence of his college professor mother may have developed a base of knowledge to springboard him into a writing career.  Having enjoyed Crowes' masterpieces such as &quot;Ridgemont High&quot; and &quot;Jerry McGuire&quot;, I'll always watch his work and feel privileged to have experienced his autobiography.The movie itself has exceptional casting.  Crudup as the rock star was perfect.  Kate Hudson as the groupie added an innocent charm that really pulled the movie together and generates the emotional response from the crowd.  And the newcomer who played a young Cameron Crowe really projected a sweetness of adolesence.There's really two overlapping parts to the movie, his life touring with rock bands which is funny and amazing, and his family's stuggles with how he and his sister handle growing up.  A less gifted writer would have just told the rock story.  But the family story adds a charm to the movie and makes you think to some of your interpersonal battle with loved ones.The surprise about this movie is why more people aren't going.

Most movies on this topic tend to be overly cynical or over romanticized, and I appreciated that it was done from such an honest perspective.I especially appreciated the line spoken by one of the old-timer band-aides while she was looking at the new girls so scornfully...""They don't even know what it is to be a fan. You know, to truly love some silly little piece of music, or some band, so much that it hurts...""Although I am not, and never have been a groupie by any stretch of the imagination I am an avid rock/pop music aficionado, I thought that line in the movie captured the spirit and sentiment of die-hard fandom perfectly...I liked the way Cameron Crowe humanized the groupies. Sure, some groupies and regular fans are definitely delusional, but many of them do have goals apart from sleeping with rock stars...and they do have feelings, just like anyone else...and I thought he demonstrated that well when developing the characer of ""Penny Lane.""At any rate, the music used in the movie is just awesome!

529093,A37O59DLEGDNTQ,B00003CXMG,SardonicCynic,"[1, 2]","&quot;Almost Famous&quot; has all the right ingredients to be a success; a nostalgic coming of age story about a young man who comes to terms with  himself and the world, an utterly appealing cast of actors, and a  writer/director who has already earned respect and praise through his  previous work. The movie is impossible to dislike it, mainly because it is  crafted with such heart-felt sincerity, and it helps greatly when the array  of performances shine from beginning to end. In terms of touching upon  issues such as growing up and realizing your own identity, &quot;Almost  Famous&quot; does a fairly effective job using the 70's rock-era as a  backdrop and a naive 15 year old as the emotional centre. It is evident  that Cameron Crowe is infusing the film with his own experiences, and it  generates a feel of affection (a bit TOO much at times) for the story and  it's characters. He has a great eye for detail, with both the physical and  emotional dynamics. I was genuinely impressed with Kate Hudson's  performance as Penny Lane, she helps build the most poignant moments, and  plays her role with beguiling nuance.

Aside from Philip Seymour Hoffman, who infuses life into every role he plays, these people were as interesting and compelling as a sack of hair.  The mom teaches something about the collective unconscious in college and yet thinks rock and roll is dangerous and evil?  The word Incongruous comes to mind.  And why is the mom, who banned her daughter from listening to Simon and Garfunkel of all things, allowing her son to skip school and join the tour bus?  How does that make any sense?  And Kate Hudson?  Vacuous as always.  Has she run away from home?  What is she doing on this tour?  She's one step away from the cheerleading squad which is fifty steps too far from a typical bus groupie at age 16.The movie started by being cute - a young kid gets a shot to do what all young, aspiring journalists want to do; interview the bands.  After that first shot of cute, the entire movie tries to ride it out for 2 hours.  I made it through one.  The reason this scenario is interesting is because it's potentially dangerous.  The only dangerous aspect of this rock and roll adventure was its bold and unceasing boredom.  Conversations that went nowhere, drug use that never materialized, the whole rock and roll fantasy here is about as adrenalin worthy as a tumbleweed blowing across state lines.

Of course, you have the love between men and women (Crudup and Hudson) First love (Fugit and Hudson) but also Mother's love for her child (McDormand and Fugit) bandmates love for eachother, the band's love of the rock-n-roll life and most importantly, Crowe's love for rock-n-roll. That's what the movie really is - an ode to rock-n-roll and why it's important to so many of us...Fugit comes of age and experiences love and loss in ways that are familar to us all, backed with a soundtrack of a lifetime.Music has always went hand-in-hand with life's little triumphs and loses for me, and it's beautifully examined in the movie. One of my favorite scenes is when the band are at a low point, Crudup and Jason Lee having just had a blow-out and Crudup having gone missing and coming down from an acid trip, when, on the bus, they all slowly join in singing &quot;Tiny Dancer&quot; and that just shows you how music can heal all wounds and make wrong things right again. Music will stick by you through good times and bad, and in those little quiet moments of reflection of past memories, who doesn't associate certain events with certain songs?It's funny, some of my friends don't 'get' the movie and to truly 'get it', I feel one must have that personal love affair with music that Crowe describes to a tee.

Even the name 'Stillwater' recalls a Lynyrd Skynyrd-type band from the mid-70's.  The scene in which William Miller becomes mesmerized by the album cover art while listening to The Who really hit a nerve with me.  This is exactly how rock fandom begins, the discovery of music and lyrics that seems to be speaking directly and only to you.  Much of the rock world that stays on the periphery of the familiar coming-of-age story is fascinating, and because it feels like it had been informed by insider knowledge, I felt like I had been brought along for the tour.  Moreover, Crowe inserts us into an eminently fascinating period of rock 'n roll, when it was going through one of its cyclical downturns.  On one side, rock music was being slowly strangled by the increasing pursuit of profits by music labels and their increasingly sinister treatment of their artists, and on the other side, there was the oncoming juggernaut of the more danceable, manufactured musical form of disco.  Another highlight for me is Phillip Seymour Hoffman as Lester Bangs.  Why Hoffman is not already a Hollywood star I have no clue.  Crudup, Hudson and McDormand are also very strong and they will certainly contend for Oscar recognition.  My only quibble about the film is that it is content with depicting everything through rose-coloured glasses.  Even the way the film ends with all the loose ends neatly tied up and everybody happy and intact seems a little too disingenuous.  Crowe seems to have ignored the rampant nihilism and misanthropy that existed at the time.  The only person in the whole film who comes off looking like an a**hole is the screeching associate editor of Rolling Stone, and she appears onscreen for only a couple of minutes.  It's strange that although Crowe's semi-alter-ego learns the important journalistic lesson of being &quot;honest and unmerciful&quot;, that advice appears to have escaped Crowe.

I rented it, then bought it.  This movie transcends your typical teenage rock movie by documenting the loss of innocence - both of the main character, William Miller (brilliantly under played by newcomer Patrick Fugit) and the music industry as a whole.Miller discovers the world of rock from listening to his older sister's albums and through circumstances ends up on an assignment for Creem magazine to write an article on Black Sabbath.  When he tries to gain entrance backstage to do the story, he ends up meeting band aid (NOT groupie) Penny Lane (played by Kate Hudson) and his life changes.  Instead of meeting Black Sabbath, he falls in with one of their opening acts, a fictitious band called Stillwater, and Miller's early career as a writer takes off.  Penny Lane befriends the young Miller and is his guide into the world of rock and roll.The achievement of this film is it manages to show the drugs and sex, the emptiness, and shallowness of the music industry without making the viewer lose fascination or obsession with its stars and glamour.  The people are human, talented, affected, and driven.  That's where the film so gloriously succeeds.  As Miller follows Stillwater on their Almost Famous Tour on assignment for Rolling Stone magazine, we see him fall in love and get used, and he just keeps coming out of the trenches to face more because in the end - every one is in it for the music and living for the moment.Some of the most magical moments in the film are between Patrick Fugit and Kate Hudson, Patrick Fugit and Billy Crudup, and Patrick Fugit and Frances McDormand.  I find it hard to imagine all the attention heaped on McDormand and Hudson to the exclusion of Fugit.  While the ensemble cast in this film is one of the best ever assembled (Altman eat your heart out), Fugit and director Crowe are the glue that hold this movie together and make it what promises to be one of the most enduring films ever made.  Not to mention Academy Award winner Anna Pacquin and Phillip Seymour Hoffman in Oscar-worthy roles.  And Jason Lee proved in this film that he should never go back to skateboarding.  Ever.Guitarist Peter Frampton was a technical consultant on this film, and Nancy Wilson (Mrs. Cameron Crowe) formerly of heart wrote the score for Almost Famous.  Cameron Crowe said as he was accepting the Academy Award for best original screenplay for Almost Famous that the film was his love letter to the music industry.  I just hope he sends a few more their way.  Or ours.  This movie proves he doesn't have to take a back seat to Harper Lee as long as he stays honest.  The more we see of Crowe in his work and the less of Cruise the better.  If dipping into his own experiences yields this kind of entertainment, I hope the well never runs dry.  In Almost Famous, he bared his soul and created a cinema masterpiece that captures more about the human spirit than anything put on celluloid in two decades.",5,The best film since To Kill a Mockingbird,1009324800,"12 26, 2001",2001,3066,"['movie', 'soul', 'honest', 'sensitive', 'raw', 'wonderfully', 'entertaining', 'drama', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'film', 'theater', 'rented', 'then', 'bought', 'movie', 'typical', 'teenage', 'rock', 'movie', 'documenting', 'loss', 'innocence', 'main', 'character', 'William', 'Miller', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'newcomer', 'Patrick', 'Fugit', 'music', 'industry', 'whole.Miller', 'world', 'rock', 'listening', 'older', 'sister', 'albums', 'circumstances', 'up', 'assignment', 'Creem', 'magazine', 'write', 'article', 'Black', 'Sabbath', 'When', 'gain', 'entrance', 'backstage', 'do', 'story', 'up', 'meeting', 'band', 'aid', 'NOT', 'groupie', 'Penny', 'Lane', 'played', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'life', 'changes', 'Instead', 'meeting', 'Black', 'Sabbath', 'one', 'opening', 'acts', 'fictitious', 'band', 'called', 'Stillwater', 'Miller', 'early', 'career', 'writer', 'off', 'Penny', 'Lane', 'young', 'Miller', 'guide', 'world', 'rock', 'roll.The', 'achievement', 'film', 'show', 'drugs', 'sex', 'emptiness', 'shallowness', 'music', 'industry', 'making', 'viewer', 'lose', 'fascination', 'obsession', 'stars', 'glamour', 'people', 'are', 'human', 'talented', 'affected', 'driven', 'where', 'film', 'so', 'gloriously', 'Miller', 'Stillwater', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'Tour', 'assignment', 'Rolling', 'Stone', 'magazine', 'see', 'fall', 'love', 'get', 'used', 'just', 'keeps', 'coming', 'trenches', 'face', 'more', 'end', 'one', 'music', 'living', 'moment.Some', 'most', 'magical', 'moments', 'film', 'are', 'Patrick', 'Fugit', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'Patrick', 'Fugit', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'Patrick', 'Fugit', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'find', 'hard', 'imagine', 'attention', 'heaped', 'McDormand', 'Hudson', 'exclusion', 'Fugit', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'film', 'one', 'best', 'ever', 'assembled', 'Altman', 'eat', 'heart', 'Fugit', 'director', 'Crowe', 'are', 'glue', 'hold', 'movie', 'together', 'make', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'enduring', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'Not', 'mention', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winner', 'Anna', 'Pacquin', 'Phillip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'Oscar-worthy', 'roles', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'proved', 'film', 'should', 'never', 'go', 'back', 'skateboarding', 'Ever.Guitarist', 'Peter', 'Frampton', 'was', 'technical', 'consultant', 'film', 'Nancy', 'Wilson', 'Mrs.', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'formerly', 'heart', 'wrote', 'score', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'said', 'was', 'accepting', 'Academy', 'Award', 'best', 'original', 'screenplay', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'film', 'was', 'love', 'letter', 'music', 'industry', 'just', 'hope', 'few', 'more', 'way', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'take', 'back', 'seat', 'Harper', 'Lee', 'as', 'long', 'honest', 'more', 'see', 'Crowe', 'work', 'less', 'Cruise', 'better', 'dipping', 'own', 'experiences', 'yields', 'kind', 'entertainment', 'hope', 'well', 'never', 'dry', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'bared', 'soul', 'created', 'cinema', 'masterpiece', 'more', 'human', 'spirit', 'anything', 'put', 'celluloid', 'two', 'decades']",Almost Famous

Well this is how it was, and full marks to Cam Crowe and his insanely talented team for blessing us with this dead-on insight into the world of a touring Rock band and the role of the journalistic 'Enemy'.Cameron and wife Nancy Wilson of Heart even wrote many of the songs, including the superb Fever Dog, with some additional contributions from music guru and Rock God, Peter Frampton. There is also a delightful cameo by Peter as the Humble Pie manager, Reg. Peter was the Pie's lead guitarist, along with the sadly late Stevie Marriott.Not only is this a flawless piece of casting, including the always excellent Frances McDormand as Pat's Mom, but the band are totally believable, even though Billy Crudup and the brilliant Jason Lee weren't even musicians at the outset. You don't get a piece of this quality without a great deal of hard work, research, and attention to detail, and between Peter Frampton and Cameron himself, they have ensured that the finished product is a work of Art.The Bootleg Cut is absurd value, featuring the extended version of the movie, plus the original and an excellent 6 track CD, which includes the Wilson-Crowe classics Fever Dog, Love Thing and Love Comes And Goes.Stillwater are totally believable as a band, musically and visually, and the Cleveland Concert (one of the numerous Special features) looks 100% genuine. Jason's Paul Rogers of Bad Company look is perfect, and his lip-synching is flawless. Likewise Billy's guitar playing.Kate Hudson absolutely shines, as does newcomer Patrick Fugit, who plays 'Cameron'. Naturally, to quote Jason, ""the chicks are good"", as you might expect with a collection of stunning and talented actresses that includes Kate, Fairuza Balk, Anna Paquin, Olivia Rosewood and Bijou Phillips.

The movie feels authentic, in part because the characters are drawn with flaws, with natural story arcs, as opposed to the cardboard cutouts that we have come to expect.William Miller, the boy at the heart of the story, has to balance his boyish desires to be one of the gang with his journalistic intentions to tell the brutal, honest truth.Kate Hudson's character, Penny Lane, injects poignancy into a movie that could have been just another ode to guitar-heads, booze and acid.Frances McDormand, as Miller's mother, also is great as a liberal counterculture mother who contends with her own desires to both protect her son and set him free.The DVD also has a number of interesting extras, including interviews, et al.

529106,A3U56M0Y8LYO6J,B00003CXMG,"Steven Y. ""Pop Culture Addict""","[1, 1]","Cameron Crowe's ""Almost Famous"" is a love letter to rock music.  You can feel his affection for the music and the culture that it spawned coursing through every scene of this film.  When creators talk of projects that are deeply personal to them, this is the type of project they are talking about.A teenager named William Miller (Patrick Fugit) is chosen by Rolling Stone magazine to write an article on an up-and-coming rock band called Stillwater.  The band finds it difficult to take the young writer seriously but eventually guitarist Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup) starts to warm up to him.  However, a groupie named Penny Lane (Kate Hudson) makes life difficult for the two men as her energetic spirit captures both of their hearts.  As William's journey with the band becomes more prolonged, he discovers more and more with each passing day that his romanticized perception of rock stars was a product of his youthful idealism.""Almost Famous"" is an enchanting work that is blessed with memorable performances.  Fugit, Crudup, and Hudson are great and the supporting work turned in by Frances McDormand, Jason Lee, and Philip Seymour Hoffman is equally solid.  Hudson in particular sparkles in her role and proves that she possesses that rare ability to light up the screen every time she appears in a scene.  Her work in this film is like an announcement to the Hollywood community that a new star has arrived.  Crowe must also be singled out for his good work.  It is oftentimes difficult for filmmakers to capture the essence of their subject matter, but Crowe admirably pulls it off with ""Almost Famous.""",3,&quot;I never said I was a golden god . . . or did I?&quot;,1078358400,"03 4, 2004",2004,1615,"['Cameron', 'Crowe', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'love', 'letter', 'rock', 'music', 'can', 'feel', 'affection', 'music', 'culture', 'spawned', 'coursing', 'scene', 'film', 'When', 'creators', 'talk', 'projects', 'are', 'deeply', 'personal', 'type', 'project', 'are', 'talking', 'teenager', 'named', 'William', 'Miller', 'Patrick', 'Fugit', 'chosen', 'Rolling', 'Stone', 'magazine', 'write', 'article', 'up-and-coming', 'rock', 'band', 'called', 'Stillwater', 'band', 'difficult', 'take', 'young', 'writer', 'seriously', 'eventually', 'guitarist', 'Russell', 'Hammond', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'warm', 'up', 'However', 'groupie', 'named', 'Penny', 'Lane', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'life', 'difficult', 'two', 'men', 'energetic', 'spirit', 'hearts', 'William', 'journey', 'band', 'more', 'prolonged', 'more', 'more', 'passing', 'day', 'romanticized', 'perception', 'rock', 'stars', 'was', 'product', 'youthful', 'idealism', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'enchanting', 'work', 'blessed', 'memorable', 'performances', 'Fugit', 'Crudup', 'Hudson', 'are', 'great', 'supporting', 'work', 'turned', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'equally', 'solid', 'Hudson', 'particular', 'sparkles', 'role', 'rare', 'ability', 'light', 'up', 'screen', 'time', 'scene', 'work', 'film', 'announcement', 'Hollywood', 'community', 'new', 'star', 'arrived', 'Crowe', 'must', 'also', 'be', 'singled', 'out', 'good', 'work', 'oftentimes', 'difficult', 'filmmakers', 'capture', 'essence', 'subject', 'matter', 'Crowe', 'admirably', 'off', 'Almost', 'Famous']",Almost Famous

All the elements are there. The 70's looks and attires, the drugs, the music (original songs written among others by P.Frampton and Cameron Crowe), the teeny ""rebellions"", the inner band strifes,the groupies and the developing rock industry, the then societal pulse, and the overall atmosphere set by the film's main characters, most notably the teen-reporter, star-groupie Penny Lane and of course the band members and last but not least the boy's ""crypto-conservative"" desperately-trying-to-be-progressive mother.""Almost famous"" is a brilliant film. Before you can even begin to care whether what the film depicts is accurate, you find yourself laughing endlessly, and being ""sucked-in"" by a story that at times has semi-documentary touches (makes sense, as the story is a semi-biographical account of Cameron Crowe's) and loving the main characters (all charismatic in their own sense).The film's main ""weapon"" is its superb humor. I dont merely mean one-liners but the overall feeling it has, you dont only laugh but this movie tends to have a feel-good sense all over it as well. It's supposed to, right? After all, this is the 70s when everything still had a ""purpose"" or when things seemed to be more upbeat (compare with the prozac ridden 90s and their ""nowhere to go from here"" sentiment).All the actors do a terrific job to make the time machine work here. The mother is great in portaying a representative of the mothers generation that first perceived music as an ""enemy"" and as a gateway to drugs and (oh my god) wild sex. The band members are going from cool to uncool all the time (as real band members very often do) as they try to act like rock stars (""make us look cool, man"") and at the same time try to maintain their human nature (...). The teeny reporter (in my opinion the least convincing of the lot) is decent too while the show is stolen by the enigmatic and pivotal character of groupie Penny Lane. She's is the one character that the others actually revolve around like satellites whether they realise it or not and also serves as a solid reminder of that period as well ( or maybe, not only of that period, in fact, why is rock music being mostly made if not to be ""cool and get chicks"")..The dialogue is great, the directing is great, the actors do a great job. Anything missing from Almost Famous to keep it from being a classic?? I would think not, but: because of the way this film works and of its very nature ppl will tend to see it as somewhat of a documentary. Is it? Tough question that one.The rock era of the 70s wasnt a monodimensional one. It wasn't only about bands that were Led Zepellin lookalikes and people who  were constantly professing ""it's all happening man"", and above all things were not always that lighthearted. In fact, a lot of people back then thought that there was a musical revolution going on which was going to -in turn- bring about an overall change of things. Ask anyone who's over 45 whether the music of that era did bring about a revolution and get prepared for some really long discussions with very differing conclusions.  Inotherwords, there were very many people around back then who took the whole thing very VERY seriously. Perhaps that is -epidermically- depicted by the rock critic in the film.It would be unfair though to criticize the film on that premise. After all you cant expect a film to fit in all that in 2 hours. And even if it somehow had done that it could've very easily been boring albeit more accurate.The fact of the matter is that ""Almost Famous"" is a wonderful film in very many respects. It goes from hilariously funny to touching with its dripping nostalgia. And yes it does have this ""things were better and purer back then"" feeling to it, but in the end the way people perceive the times they live in depend on very many different factors.I've seen this movie twice already and loved it both times and i hardly see how anyone could not love it actually no matter what other thoughts are to be had on the side.Almost famous is almost perfect",4,Almost a documentary..,1028160000,"08 1, 2002",2002,4368,"['Roll', 'back', '70s', 'teenaged', 'reporter', 'who', 'reviews', 'underground', 'rock-mag', 'Creem', 'sudden', 'break', 'when', 'employed', 'big-league-mag', 'Rolling', 'Stone', 'go', 'road', 'up', 'coming', 'Stillwater', 'deliver', 'report', 'them.During', 'wild', '3', 'weeks', 'road', 'inside', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'era', 'elements', 'are', 'there', '70', 'looks', 'attires', 'drugs', 'music', 'original', 'songs', 'written', 'others', 'P.Frampton', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'teeny', 'rebellions', 'inner', 'band', 'strifes', 'groupies', 'developing', 'rock', 'industry', 'then', 'societal', 'pulse', 'overall', 'atmosphere', 'set', 'film', 'main', 'characters', 'most', 'notably', 'teen-reporter', 'star-groupie', 'Penny', 'Lane', 'course', 'band', 'members', 'last', 'not', 'least', 'boy', 'crypto-conservative', 'desperately-trying-to-be-progressive', 'mother', 'Almost', 'famous', 'brilliant', 'film', 'can', 'even', 'begin', 'care', 'what', 'film', 'depicts', 'accurate', 'find', 'laughing', 'endlessly', 'being', 'sucked-in', 'story', 'times', 'semi-documentary', 'touches', 'sense', 'story', 'semi-biographical', 'account', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'loving', 'main', 'characters', 'charismatic', 'own', 'sense', 'film', 'main', 'weapon', 'superb', 'humor', 'dont', 'merely', 'mean', 'one-liners', 'overall', 'feeling', 'dont', 'only', 'laugh', 'movie', 'have', 'feel-good', 'sense', 'over', 'as', 'well', 'supposed', 'right', '70s', 'when', 'everything', 'still', 'had', 'purpose', 'when', 'things', 'seemed', 'be', 'more', 'upbeat', 'compare', 'prozac', '90s', 'nowhere', 'go', 'here', 'sentiment', 'actors', 'do', 'terrific', 'job', 'make', 'time', 'machine', 'work', 'here', 'mother', 'great', 'portaying', 'representative', 'mothers', 'generation', 'first', 'perceived', 'music', 'enemy', 'gateway', 'drugs', 'oh', 'god', 'sex', 'band', 'members', 'are', 'going', 'cool', 'uncool', 'time', 'real', 'band', 'members', 'very', 'often', 'do', 'try', 'act', 'rock', 'stars', 'make', 'look', 'cool', 'man', 'same', 'time', 'try', 'maintain', 'human', 'nature', 'teeny', 'reporter', 'opinion', 'least', 'convincing', 'lot', 'decent', 'too', 'show', 'stolen', 'enigmatic', 'pivotal', 'character', 'groupie', 'Penny', 'Lane', 'one', 'character', 'others', 'actually', 'revolve', 'satellites', 'realise', 'not', 'also', 'solid', 'reminder', 'period', 'as', 'well', 'maybe', 'not', 'only', 'period', 'fact', 'why', 'rock', 'music', 'being', 'mostly', 'made', 'not', 'be', 'cool', 'get', 'chicks', '..The', 'dialogue', 'great', 'directing', 'great', 'actors', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'Anything', 'missing', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'keep', 'being', 'classic', 'would', 'think', 'not', 'way', 'film', 'very', 'nature', 'ppl', 'will', 'tend', 'see', 'somewhat', 'documentary', 'Tough', 'question', 'one.The', 'rock', 'era', '70s', 'wasnt', 'monodimensional', 'one', 'was', ""n't"", 'only', 'about', 'were', 'Led', 'Zepellin', 'lookalikes', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'constantly', 'professing', 'happening', 'man', 'things', 'were', 'not', 'always', 'lighthearted', 'fact', 'lot', 'people', 'back', 'then', 'thought', 'was', 'musical', 'revolution', 'going', 'was', 'going', '-in', 'turn-', 'bring', 'overall', 'change', 'things', 'Ask', 'anyone', 'who', '45', 'music', 'era', 'did', 'bring', 'about', 'revolution', 'get', 'prepared', 'really', 'long', 'discussions', 'very', 'differing', 'conclusions', 'Inotherwords', 'were', 'very', 'many', 'people', 'back', 'then', 'who', 'took', 'whole', 'thing', 'very', 'VERY', 'seriously', 'Perhaps', '-epidermically-', 'depicted', 'rock', 'critic', 'film.It', 'would', 'be', 'unfair', 'criticize', 'film', 'premise', 'cant', 'expect', 'film', 'fit', '2', 'hours', 'even', 'somehow', 'had', 'done', 'could', ""'ve"", 'very', 'easily', 'been', 'boring', 'more', 'accurate.The', 'fact', 'matter', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'wonderful', 'film', 'very', 'many', 'respects', 'hilariously', 'funny', 'touching', 'dripping', 'nostalgia', 'yes', 'have', 'things', 'were', 'better', 'purer', 'back', 'then', 'feeling', 'end', 'way', 'people', 'perceive', 'times', 'live', 'depend', 'very', 'many', 'different', 'factors.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'twice', 'already', 'loved', 'times', 'i', 'hardly', 'see', 'how', 'anyone', 'could', 'not', 'love', 'actually', 'matter', 'what', 'other', 'thoughts', 'are', 'be', 'had', 'side.Almost', 'famous', 'almost', 'perfect']",Almost Famous

It's about a young boy, William Miller, who's healthy relationship with his mother is what's keeping him away from the experience of sex, drugs, and rock 'n roll. After his older sister leaves him with her collection of familiar 1970s records and a note explaining that one song by The Who can make him see his future, he grows up and dives into the rock culture of what the world once became. Sooner or later, Lester Bangs, a famous critic for rock music, becomes a mentor and leads William to his dream of living the ultimate behind the scenes life as a flourishing young journalist. Just as William enters the world and finds the true meaning of being on tour, he finds himself overwhelmed hanging out with a fictional hard rock band Stillwater. He also finds himself gorgeously infatuated with the openminded dreamer Penny Lane, a young band aid, which is a false name she takes on, and would never tell a soul.As soon as the hardship of the almost famous band and later confessions of secrets uncover, they sit quiet, put things behind them, and grow closer together. They also sing along together to Elton John's Tiny Dancer (a memorable scene). While the tour continues, and William's mother's concerned phone calls continue, William loses his virginity but gains the meaning of what it means to understand and appreciate life in general, and that you can't take the good without taking the bad.This movie is a classic instant winner, with a cast that shines, and music that catches you.

It concerns William, an endearing 15 year-old who is mature but nave and tags along with a rock band in order to write a profile of them for Rolling Stone.  The band's leader, Russell, is worldly but immature -- just the opposite of William.  Both have to enter the other's world, both physically and emotionally, to become complete.  Fluttering between them is Penny Lane, the groupie who is about William's age but can't see his love for her because of her infatuation with Russell, who is easily twice her age and who uses her as a plaything.  It reminds me a bit of the love story in Forrest Gump, where the woman goes for a series of manipulative men who embody the Zeitgeist of the kooky `70s while she ignores the simple and true love that is hers for the asking.  Almost Famous captures the crazy feeling of a rock band on tour and the strained dynamics that can almost break up a band.  Despite the debauched background of a mid-70s rock and roll tour, this is a sweet film that is by turns funny and touching.

Period pieces can be a gamble, they're usually inaccurate, or overly goofy, but this movie was very well done.  Billy Crudup does a killer job of playing a messed-up rock star.  He probably won't win any awards for it (the best ones never do), but he is definitely deserving of it.  Patrick Fugit is a likeable young actor, and Kate Hudson is extremely talented (not to mention very beutiful).  The story, basically, is of a young writer in the early 70's who goes on tour with a nascent rock band to interview them for a magazine article, during which he befriends the band members, and finds love with a mysterious female follower.  I found the story to be particularly enthralling, due to my love for music, and for the fact that I myself love to write, so it was easy for me to put myself into the place of the main character, and see the story through his eyes.  I also enjoyed the gritty depiction of the life of a rock star, it's important that people remember that it's not all glitz and glam.  The world has changed in the past thirty years, but this story could easily occur much the same way in the here and now.  I cannot recommend this movie enough.  It will surely stay in your mind for days after you have watched it.  Also, there are tons of great songs in this movie, many of which can be found on the soundtrack.  There's even a song by Stillwater, the fictitous band from the movie.  I know these guys are actors, not musicians, but they rock!  The part where they are singing &quot;Tiny Dancer&quot; on the bus is really cool, too, I'm guessing it symbolizes something, but I haven't figured out what yet.  It had to have some meaning.  Anyway, there are plenty of reasons why you should see this movie.  It is the greatest thing to come out in a long time.

529118,A1D2CY8YIHTDXM,B00003CXMG,Tim Chong,"[18, 19]","This is the rare instance where the director's post-release tinkering has improved what was already a fantastic film. Watching the &quot;Untitled&quot; cut (Director Cameron Crowe had such difficulty coming up with a title he almost released the film as &quot;Untitled&quot;) is like discovering long-lost chapters to your favorite book, or hearing outtakes from your favorite band. The additional scenes bring viewers further into both the hero's home life and the surreal life on the road of a touring rock band. The original cut of the movie is included in the set, but why anyone would want to see it after seeing this film in the longer form is beyond me.And the extras ... simply the best on a DVD I've ever come across. The commentary with Crowe and his mother is at turns insightful, touching and hilarious. The part where they discuss whether Crowe lost his virginity the same way his alter ego on screen did is worth the price of admission alone. The deleted scenes include one that invites the viewer to cue up &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; since that was supposed to be the soundtrack for the scene, but the rights was unavailable. The satisfaction of seeing the characters on screen react to your dubbing is incredible. And there's a bonus CD of songs by &quot;Stillwater,&quot; the faux band in the film. The songs are a great pastiche of 70s rock that heighten the believability of the film. You really think you're listening to a great undiscovered band from the time.As for the movie itself, the original film deservedly won an Oscar for best original screenplay and should have won more. Had more of Kate Hudson's performance as &quot;band aid&quot; Penny Lane been in the movie, she would have an Oscar today. Billy Crudup perfectly personifies both the innocence and the arrogance '70s rockers exuded, while Patrick Fugit's performance captures the uncool kid yearning to be cool we all were at that age.Put simply, if you even just mildly enjoyed &quot;Almost Famous,&quot; you owe it to yourself to give this a spin.

This is essentially a film about family, both actual families and adopted families of friends, with all the problems this entails.The performances range from really good, to decent.  Fugit does a passable job, although he still comes off as a kind of annoying kid.  While this doesn't kill the movie or anything, it does let him get overshadowed by much of the rest of the case.  MCDormand and Deschanel both put in great performances, and are really likable.  You feel that this is the guys family with them.  Hoffman of course steals the scenes he is in, but this is to be expected.  Jason Lee, who before this movie was know for comedy, also really carries his scenes, and it is easy to see how he keeps getting work and increasing notoriety.  The two real standouts for me were Billy Crudup and Kate Hudson.  Both delivered very real performances, showing a huge range of emotion though the film and really portraying broken people.The writing itself is for the most part good.  The story is very believable.  Since this is somewhat autobiographical, this is to be expected.  A problem this film does have is pacing.  It really drags in some parts and could have had a better flow.  It is a nice looking film, but not so to the point you will think about the visuals later.The music should also be mentioned.  There are some really good performances and some just good music scattered throughout.  The performance of Tiny Dancer in particular is spectacular.This is a good, if somewhat slow movie.

Scarillo ""music snob""","[3, 3]","REVIEW OF THE UK BLU-RAY IMPORT -- ""Almost Famous"" is a terrific movie that plays almost like a fan's love-letter to Rock N'Roll - this and ""High Fidelity"" are probably two of the best films that will remind you of why you love rock music so much (and both rank in my personal favorites for both films of the last 10 years or so, as well as rock n roll films).  I'll assume that if you've searched for ""Almost Famous""'s Blu-Ray version, you're probably already familiar with the movie (and like me, might be looking to upgrade), so i'll cut to the chase on the Blu-Ray version:  Overall, it's a good transfer, though i don't know that i'd say it's a spectacular transfer to the point of being revelatory in the visual sense.  The version of the film presented here is the 'Untitled' cut, which runs around 2 hours 40 min or so, and sound quality is very good.  This pressing is actually a UK pressing, though (as i learned) there doesn't seem to be regional-coding protections on Blu-Ray (as there are on DVD's) and this disc played fine in my US machine (no artifacts, etc).  There are very few extras: only a 2 minute Lester Bangs interview plus around 10 min of table readings/set rehearsal footage.  So if you popped for the 2 DVD/1CD ""Almost Famous"" so-called 'bootleg' edition, i'd recommend hanging onto that set (which is now out of print, i believe), if only for the extras, the audio CD, etc.  Overall, i guess i'm happy to have it on Blu-Ray, though the skimpy extras and the almost-negligible improvement in picture quality somewhat temper my satisfaction with this purchase.",3,"5-star movie, but Blu-Ray is bare-bones",1270944000,"04 11, 2010",2010,1587,"['REVIEW', 'THE', 'UK', 'BLU-RAY', 'IMPORT', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'terrific', 'movie', 'almost', 'fan', 'love-letter', 'Rock', ""N'Roll"", 'High', 'Fidelity', 'are', 'probably', 'two', 'best', 'films', 'will', 'remind', 'why', 'love', 'rock', 'music', 'so', 'much', 'rank', 'personal', 'favorites', 'films', 'last', '10', 'years', 'so', 'as', 'well', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'films', ""'ll"", 'assume', ""'ve"", 'searched', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'Blu-Ray', 'version', ""'re"", 'probably', 'already', 'familiar', 'movie', 'might', 'be', 'looking', 'upgrade', 'so', 'i', ""'ll"", 'cut', 'chase', 'Blu-Ray', 'version', 'Overall', 'good', 'transfer', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'i', ""'d"", 'say', 'spectacular', 'transfer', 'point', 'being', 'revelatory', 'visual', 'sense', 'version', 'film', 'presented', 'here', ""'Untitled"", 'cut', '2', 'hours', '40', 'min', 'so', 'sound', 'quality', 'very', 'good', 'pressing', 'actually', 'UK', 'pressing', 'though', 'i', 'learned', 'there', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'regional-coding', 'protections', 'Blu-Ray', 'are', 'DVD', 'disc', 'played', 'fine', 'US', 'machine', 'artifacts', 'etc', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'extras', 'only', '2', 'minute', 'Lester', 'Bangs', 'interview', '10', 'min', 'table', 'readings/set', 'rehearsal', 'footage', 'So', 'popped', '2', 'DVD/1CD', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'so-called', ""'bootleg"", 'edition', 'i', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'hanging', 'set', 'now', 'print', 'i', 'believe', 'only', 'extras', 'audio', 'CD', 'etc', 'Overall', 'i', 'guess', 'i', ""'m"", 'happy', 'have', 'Blu-Ray', 'skimpy', 'extras', 'almost-negligible', 'improvement', 'picture', 'quality', 'somewhat', 'temper', 'satisfaction', 'purchase']",Almost Famous

We are presented with a brown tri-fold package, much like the bootleg recordings of the seventies. Not a whole lot of artwork on the cover. Simply a small photo of Kate Hudson (Penny Lane).The first tri-fold presents us with a wonderful addition to this DVD set. Included is a STILLWATER Music CD. This music CD is only available in this collection and features songs from the film as performed by Stillwater. Four of the tracks are co written by Nancy Wilson ( of Heart ) and Cameron Crowe ( the director ). This little bonus CD is great and very appropriate to the theme of the set.I'll jump now to DISC 2 of this set which is the Original Theatrical Version of &quot;Almost Famous&quot;. This is the academy award winning version that was released and it's great. The story is well told and very engaging.DISC 1 is &quot;Untitled: Almost Famous : The Bootleg Cut&quot; which is not rated.This version is a gift.Cameron Crowe has taken the time to ( lovingly ) recut his film and include an additional 36 minutes of film. The addition of these precious minutes change the film but do not deminish it's impact or watchability.The additional 36 minutes add mostly to the character of Penny Lane ( Academy Award Nominee Kate Hudson ) and expand on her history.Unlike many extended versions which add little to character development, this version of &quot;Almost Famous&quot; brings more insight and depth to nearly all characters.The acting is outstanding, and it's clear that the scenes not in the original release were cut strictly due to time constraints as the acting is right on.This is a great cast. Kate Hudson is a stand out, as is newcomer Patrick Fugit. Billy Crudup is wonderful as well, this is the movie which should have made him a movie star. Jason Lee ( of &quot;Chasing Amy&quot; and other Kevin Smith films ) is hysterical and just enough over the top to be believable. The movie, this version, rests soundly with Kate Hudson and Patrick Fugit.I would think, had this Bootleg version been released theatrically, then perhaps Kate Hudson would have actually won the Academy Award rahter than just being nominated.

I didn't want to like this movie, but it's so very likeable.  Yeah, there are plenty of corny moments, but there are more moments of honesty than camp.  Kate Hudson was nominated for Best Supporting Actress for her role as Penny Lane.  Her performance is endearing, a little provocative, but ultimately vapid.  The real star here is Patrick Fugit.  If for no other reason, see this movie to see his performance.  You have to root for him 'cause he's so damn pure and true to himself despite all the people trying to sway him to their way of thinking.

Any number of films have benefited from this type of &quot;remake&quot;. Just as many, though, have had little added. In effect being able to go back and re-edit a film as allowed artistic second guessing. Sometimes it's to the disadvantage of a classic.Crowe's &quot;bootleg&quot; version of Almost Famous (released under it's original title &quot;Untitled&quot;) kind of falls between these two camps as nothing essential is really added back to the film. A pity this wasn't released like this previously as the running commentary between Crowe and his Mom is actually interesting.Still, kudos to Crowe (and the marketing folks at Dreamworks)for the way this package is put together. The CD of unreleased songs and having both versions of the film make this an interesting boxed set. A pity that Apocalypse Now Redux wasn't released in this format (there's a good example of a film that would benefit this type of packaging. It would have allowed the inclusion of the original film, the re-edited version --in the slightly different aspect ratio--along with the stunning documentary Hearts of Darkness by Coppola's wife).SInce music is so essential to all of Crowe's films I can't help but wonder what he will do as a film director/writer once he finishes mining the past.

It's not quite perfect enough to receive a 5 star rank, but it's better than just plain 4 stars.  Either way, this movie is awesome from star to finish.I look at a director like Cameron Crowe and wonder why more people have not heard of him.  From his 1996 blockbuster hit &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; to his newest movie: &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot;, he seems to be on a role; or at least good at directing them.  This movie tells the story of the 70's little-known rock band Stillwater.  It's a brilliant story that at many points trys to include you in the movie.  First time actor Patrick Fugit could not have played the part of a fan/writer any better.  He's stellar, and you can't help but fall in love with him.  Oh, that innocence.  We also see appearances by the famous (or infamous, which ever you prefer) 'Penny Lane', played by the beautiful, yet cute, Kate Hudson.  And if you know anything about the actual band, this movie strikes new hope into the based-on-a-true-stories era that never really amounts to much.  The two main stars of the band,  Russell Hammond (played by Billy Crudup) and Jeff Bebe (Jason Lee) work wonders with each other, even if they are just fighting throughout the movie.And as you see, the cast is just piling up with stars.  Along with Crudup, Hudson, Fugit, and Lee (who, by the way, stars in Cameron Crowes mentioned film &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot;) we have SNL star Jimmy Fallon and an underrated Philip Seymour Hoffman.  Philip plays the part of &quot;Lester Bangs&quot;; rock and roll star by way of musical taste.  All in all every part is covered, and covered well.I can't imagine why anyone who likes rock music, great movies, or a combination of both, wouldn't like this movie.

It's not that there's anything amazing in the extra stuff (or else it would have been in the theatrical version), but it's certainly fun to watch - especially the scene with a stoned DJ interviewing the band.--- The &quot;Cleveland Concert&quot; is actually just 3 songs, 15 minutes long.  Interesting to watch, good music, although it does sound like studio recordings with a bit of crowd noise before and after the songs.  (No crowd noise at moments during the songs where it might be appropriate.)--- The music CD has 6 songs by the fictional group Stillwater.  The last 3 sound as if they're the same exact recordings as in the &quot;Cleveland Concert.&quot;  Still, this is one of the attractions that got me to buy the set, and it's something to play in the stereo or in the car.  (I wonder why these songs weren't on the soundtrack CD though?)--- I enjoyed hearing Mr. Crowe's rundown of the &quot;Top Albums of 1973.&quot;  He explains the enduring value of each of CDs by Bowie, the Stones, Jackson Browne and others.--- The infamous &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; scene is finally released.

529138,A23IOPI0D1OG7V,B00003CXMG,"WILLIE A YOUNG II ""willow""","[3, 3]","...A great movie that manages to capture the joy, decadence, fun and earthy feel of the rock scene in the early 70's. While much is made of Kate Hudson and Billy Crudup (who are both solid actors in star-making performances)my favorite performances are by Jason Lee (he oozes real rock star appeal without being a jerk) and the always terrific Frances McDormand (is it me, or is she REALLY SEXY in this role?)both underrated actors who seem to flourish in these surroundings. While this is a semi-fictional account of an up and coming band starting to make waves and a loving homage to the music of Cameron Crowe's youth, many have questioned it's authenticity. You people are totally missing the point! This is a film made for music junkies like me who smile everytime we recognize a song (the movie is chock-full of those moments)and for those who were actually around during that magical era in music. Moments like Stillwater taking to the stage and ripping into ""Fever Dog"" or sitting around thier hotel strumming guitars and drinking with their women are classic! This film isn't meant to reflect everybody's reality, it's a fond remembrance of what that time was like for one young man who got the chance of a lifetime and lived it to the fullest. This is one of the best rock'n'roll movies ever made and gets better every time I watch it. ""Almost Famous"" is very enjoyable and hits all the right notes for a music/film geek like myself.

529140,A295P2KZIWUAWI,B00003CXMG,"W. Langan ""take403""","[3, 3]","This movie is a semi-autobiography of how Cameron Crowe (director of Almost Famous) got started as a rock journalist.It all begins in the Christmas of 1969 in San Diego (complete with the Chimpmunks singing ""Christmas Don't Be Late"" in the background), where 11 year old William Miller finds out an embarassing secret and his rebellious older sister Anita (Zooey Deschanel) leaves home to see the country.  She leaves him her record collection with a note ""Light a candle while listening to Tommy and you will see your future.""  Cut to 1973, William (Patrick Fugit) turns 15 and aspires to interview some rock bands, with his semi-understandably protective mother (Frances McDonald) as the reluctant chauffer.  Here he befriends the charismatic ""band aid"" Penny Lane, whom he naturally grows to have a crush on (Kate Hudson) and the rock band Stillwater against rock critic Lester Bangs'(played by Philip Seymour Hoffman) advice.  William and Penny wind up on tour with the band, with William trying hard to get interviews with each member with little success.  Lead singer Jeff Bebe (Jason Lee) is in love with fame (""Make me look cool, man!"") and Russell the guitarist just wants everything to be ""real, man!""  Based loosely on the adventures of the Allman Brothers and Led Zeppelin (""I'm a golden god!""), William sees the rise and near falls of Stillwater firsthand. Meanwhile, Mrs. Miller wants her son William home.  ""Rock stars have kidnapped my son!"" she exclaims, while attempting to teach college students.Then, of course, there's the music- The Who's ""Sparks"", Simon and Garfunkel's ""America"", The Guess Who's ""Albert Flasher"", Neil Young's ""Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere,"" Elton John's ""Tiny Dancer"" and ""Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters"", Stevie Wonder's ""Cherie Amour"", Black Sabbath's ""Paranoid"", Yes' ""Your Move"", Deep Purple's ""Burn"" (which came out in 1974), Zeppelin's ""Rain Song"", ""That's the Way"" and ""Tangerine"" and closing with the Beach Boys' surrealistic ""Feel Flows.""If you really liked the movie, I cannot recommend The Bootleg Cut enough.  In addition to the movie (both the director's cut and the cinema version), there are outtakes (one features William trying to defend that music is art with ""Stairway to Heaven"" in which you provide the musical soundtrack yourself!), the Stillwater concert in its entirety, Cameron Crowe's comments on some of his favorite albums of the 1970's, some of Crowe's interviews with Zep, Fleetwood Mac, Allman Bros and a CD of Stillwater's songs (written by Peter Frampton, Nancy Wilson and Cameron Crowe).  Last but not least is an introspective commentary given by Mr. Crowe (with support of his mother!).
