967419,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000E3L7E6,A Customer,"[8, 11]","The uneasy alliance between commerce, art, lust and love lies at the heart of Craig Lucas's mordantly pessimistic The Dying Gaul. Featuring three totally unsympathetic characters that viewers will love to hate, this movie is about what happens when people choose money and desire over artistic integrity, and ultimately sells out for the greater dollar.Robert (Peter Sarsgaard) is trying to sell his script of The Dying Gaul. It's a tragic love story; a semi-autobiographical tale about AIDS based on his relationship with his now-dead agent and partner Malcolm (Bill Camp).  Jeffrey (Campbell Scott) is a suave and slick bottom line-driven producer interested in Robert's (Peter Sarsgaard) script. But to make the project commercially viable, Jeffrey demands that Robert change the central couple from a homosexual to heterosexual duo.Robert is initially appalled that Robert would suggest such a thing, but Robert lays it on the line, saying that Americans won't go to see a movie about g*y people, and that ""America hates g*y people.""  Jettisoning his integrity, Robert eventually sells out and does as Jeffrey asks, in the process pocketing $1 million and establishing an intimate friendship with Jeffrey and his failed screenwriter and bored wife Elaine (Patricia Clarkson), whose spends most of her life in her multi-million dollar, palatial modernist home.Whilst Robert attends glamorous industry luncheons put on by the wealthy couple, Jeffrey begins to put the moves on the young screenwriter. And after learning that Robert frequents chat rooms, Elaine strikes up an in-disguise online conversation with her new friend and makes a devastating discovery, igniting a desire for retribution, and leading to a dangerous game of cyberspace cat-and-mouse in which Elaine poses as the back-from-the-dead spirit of Malcolm.As the three-way friendship begins to collapse in on itself, the less than savory personalities come to the forefront, highlighting their penchant for lies and duplicity.  Mr. Lucas and his director of photography, Bobby Bukowski, create stark compositions of cool blue and hot red light, the ice and fire that lurk within the characters. His protagonists make some tough, sad choices, their faade of moneyed contentment shattered by their manipulative and calculating games.The acting is superlative, with Scott, Clarkson and Sarsgaard turning in tour de force performances as the embattled trio. Sarsgaard is touching and fully engaged, Scott is astonishingly duplicitous playing a man of power, influence and a happy-go-lucky lack of conscience; and as Elaine, Clarkson makes every glimmer of sympathy, doubt and steely resolve register.The Dying Gaul offers no easy answers on the problems of compromised principles, the price of greed and the closeted nature of Hollywood, and in fact sometimes the movie may be a little too complicated and heavy handed for its own good. But as the tragic climax comes, and the characters reach their final denouement, we see that people will ultimately do crazy things when afflicted by loss, betrayal and rage.

And all rather beside the point.""Exactly.  Patricia Clarkson, Campbell Scott, Peter Sarsgaard are all spectacular here.  I thought Scott was the standout.  And, the movie looks incredible.  But the dark mood of the movie got darker and darker...and simply less likable.  By the end, you won't care for any of the three protagonists.  I watched the movie with two other people.  None of us liked the ending...nor did it matter by that point.  We just wanted it to end.  We were intrigued by the presence of an 'alternate ending' on the DVD.  It's basically the same ending, but it goes on a bit longer and only confirms that the ambiguity of the released ending was intended (one character expresses the ambiguity in a voice over).",2,"Great acting, but by the end you won't care for any of the three protagonists",1170720000,"02 6, 2007",2007,992,"['came', 'page', 'struggling', 'how', 'encapsulate', 'take', ""'Dying"", 'Gaul', 'see', 'amazon', 'reviewer', 'Josh', 'Lanyon', 'nailed', 'perfectly', 'actors', 'were', 'brilliant', 'thing', 'so', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'music', 'mood', 'little', 'touches', 'great', 'rather', 'point.', 'Exactly', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'Campbell', 'Scott', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'are', 'spectacular', 'here', 'thought', 'Scott', 'was', 'standout', 'movie', 'incredible', 'dark', 'mood', 'movie', 'got', 'darker', 'darker', 'simply', 'less', 'likable', 'end', 'wo', ""n't"", 'care', 'three', 'protagonists', 'watched', 'movie', 'two', 'other', 'people', 'None', 'liked', 'ending', 'did', 'matter', 'point', 'just', 'wanted', 'end', 'were', 'intrigued', 'presence', ""'alternate"", 'ending', 'DVD', 'basically', 'same', 'ending', 'bit', 'longer', 'only', 'ambiguity', 'released', 'ending', 'was', 'intended', 'one', 'character', 'ambiguity', 'voice']",N/A

 yes and no.  she punishes for the injustice done to her by the two men, but the way she does it is pure evil.  pretending to be the dead lover and getting a psychologically unstable sarsgaard to believe it is simply sadistic.  i love the way that sarsgaard portrays his emotional instability.  you can see it on display in an intimate moment with scott, you can see it when he talks to the mother of his child, you can see it when he is conflicted between what to do at the end of the movie.  was his revenge on clarkson justified?  yes and no.  she played the one thing against him that would hurt and injure the most.  it is the ultimate slap in the face to me it was the lowest that you could go.  should he have gone as far as he did, no there was colateral damage that was unnecessary.  did scott get what he deserved?  yes and no.  did he deserve to lose his family yes he did, he was willing to put his family in jeopardy for an affair and he got busted.  did he deserve to lose his family in the way they were lost, no, no one should lose people that way.  this is such an intertwining drama that i feel it is almost shakespearean.  the drama, coincidence, the cause and effect, simply put the humanity of it all.  kharma is mentioned in the movie and is a core theme to the movie, be careful what you do it will come back and kick you in the but.  i really like the movie, to me it is written very intelligently with very little excess or underdeveloped points.  all the actors turn in great performances and fill out the characters perfectly.  see it, it is worth the time and the effort, better than a lot of dramas that have come out lately.",4,SUBTLE YET MANIPULATIVE DRAMA,1146268800,"04 29, 2006",2006,2729,"['i', 'really', 'was', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'movie', 'friend', 'mine', 'told', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'yet', 'i', 'still', 'had', 'little', 'preconception', 'going', 'i', 'really', 'love', 'peter', 'sarsgaard', 'patricia', 'clarkson', 'are', 'great', 'actor/actress', 'sarsgaard', 'grieving', 'lover', 'aids', 'victim', 'grief', 'excellent', 'script', 'campbell', 'scott', 'make', 'change', 'same', 'time', 'two', 'bond', 'become', 'friends', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'sarsgaard', 'meets', 'clarkson', 'wife', 'campbell', 'odd', 'love', 'triangle', 'complete', 'fascinated', 'sarsgaard', 'two', 'become', 'close', 'sex', 'keep', 'mind', 'movie', 'set', '1995', 'advent', 'chat', 'room', 'still', 'relatively', 'new', 'chat', 'room', 'way', 'extracting', 'info', 'sarsgaard', 'generally', 'would', 'not', 'reveal', 'outright', 'end', 'received', 'more', 'information', 'bargained', 'now', 'let', 'say', 'general', 'i', 'women', 'when', 'let', 'manipulation', 'turn', 'evil', 'movie', 'clarkson', 'so', 'evil', 'however', 'evil', 'deserved', 'yes', 'injustice', 'done', 'two', 'men', 'way', 'pure', 'evil', 'pretending', 'be', 'dead', 'lover', 'getting', 'psychologically', 'unstable', 'sarsgaard', 'believe', 'simply', 'sadistic', 'i', 'love', 'way', 'sarsgaard', 'emotional', 'instability', 'can', 'see', 'display', 'intimate', 'moment', 'scott', 'can', 'see', 'when', 'mother', 'child', 'can', 'see', 'when', 'conflicted', 'what', 'do', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'revenge', 'clarkson', 'justified', 'yes', 'played', 'one', 'thing', 'would', 'hurt', 'injure', 'most', 'ultimate', 'slap', 'face', 'was', 'lowest', 'could', 'go', 'should', 'have', 'gone', 'as', 'far', 'did', 'was', 'colateral', 'damage', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'did', 'scott', 'get', 'what', 'deserved', 'yes', 'did', 'deserve', 'lose', 'family', 'yes', 'did', 'was', 'willing', 'put', 'family', 'jeopardy', 'affair', 'got', 'busted', 'did', 'deserve', 'lose', 'family', 'way', 'were', 'lost', 'one', 'should', 'lose', 'people', 'way', 'such', 'intertwining', 'drama', 'i', 'feel', 'almost', 'shakespearean', 'drama', 'coincidence', 'cause', 'effect', 'simply', 'put', 'humanity', 'kharma', 'mentioned', 'movie', 'core', 'theme', 'movie', 'be', 'careful', 'what', 'do', 'will', 'come', 'back', 'kick', 'i', 'really', 'movie', 'written', 'very', 'intelligently', 'very', 'little', 'excess', 'underdeveloped', 'points', 'actors', 'turn', 'great', 'performances', 'fill', 'out', 'characters', 'perfectly', 'see', 'time', 'effort', 'better', 'lot', 'dramas', 'have', 'come', 'out', 'lately']",N/A
967423,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000E3L7E6,Ed Uyeshima,"[8, 8]","A trio of superb performances ignites writer-director Craig Lucas's 2005 bludgeoning psychological thriller set in the deal-making, Machiavellian world of Hollywood filmmaking circa 1995. The plot focuses on an unconventional triangle - Robert is a young screenwriter who gets summoned to a meeting with Jeffrey, a powerful studio executive, who is very interested in adapting Robert's script into a movie. There's one catch - the script is a tribute to Robert's partner, who died recently of AIDS after going through painful medical treatments, and Jeffrey wants to change the story to a heterosexual love story to assure the movie has wider commercial appeal. With an offer of a million dollars upfront for the script, Robert begrudgingly accepts the change, but then he meets Jeffrey's wife, Elaine, who becomes drawn to Robert through his deeply felt script. Her attraction is platonic but increasingly obsessive. At the same time, Robert and Jeffrey become lovers, and the plot dives headlong into intriguing twists relating to Internet chat rooms and layering deceptions that lead to a fatalistic conclusion.Once again proving to be one of our most audacious actors, Peter Sarsgaard brings a fearlessly fey quality to Robert that allows his character to harden as the encroaching deceptions envelop him. Looking very much the part of the patrician, artistically frustrated Hollywood wife, Patricia Clarkson gives her typically sharp, insightful performance as Elaine especially as her efforts to manipulate Robert backfire into her own unfolding, painful situation. What she does very well is show the vulnerability of her character regardless of her misogynistic intentions. With his stentorian voice used in an ideal context, Campbell Scott finally shows some of the fire of his late parents (George C. Scott and Colleen Dewhurst) in exposing the deviously powerful character of Jeffrey ultimately rendered powerless by the circumstances.Although the movie takes advantage of Los Angeles locations, including a stunning hilltop home (complete with infinity pool, of course), it still feels very much like a play especially in Lucas's use of talking headshots and voiceovers to amplify the ennui of the chat room activity. Where the film goes somewhat awry is the series of developments in the last half-hour that lead to the ending where Robert's sense of paranoia brings certain facts to light and responses become increasingly contrived. Regardless, Lucas's gift for smart dialogue and the three performances lend credence to the wildly implausible developments. With the hoopla over the wondrous ""Brokeback Mountain"" (which I just saw), it will be interesting to see if Jeffrey's mercenary comments about the box-office poison of gay-themed films will remain true.",4,Twisted Triangle of Deception Smartly Rendered Even When It Spins Around Credibility,1134345600,"12 12, 2005",2005,2775,"['trio', 'superb', 'performances', 'writer-director', 'Craig', 'Lucas', '2005', 'bludgeoning', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'set', 'deal-making', 'Machiavellian', 'world', 'Hollywood', 'filmmaking', 'circa', '1995', 'plot', 'unconventional', 'triangle', 'Robert', 'young', 'screenwriter', 'who', 'summoned', 'meeting', 'Jeffrey', 'powerful', 'studio', 'executive', 'who', 'very', 'interested', 'adapting', 'Robert', 'script', 'movie', 'one', 'catch', 'script', 'tribute', 'Robert', 'partner', 'who', 'died', 'recently', 'AIDS', 'going', 'painful', 'medical', 'treatments', 'Jeffrey', 'change', 'story', 'heterosexual', 'love', 'story', 'assure', 'movie', 'wider', 'commercial', 'appeal', 'offer', 'million', 'dollars', 'upfront', 'script', 'Robert', 'begrudgingly', 'change', 'then', 'Jeffrey', 'wife', 'Elaine', 'who', 'drawn', 'Robert', 'deeply', 'felt', 'script', 'attraction', 'platonic', 'increasingly', 'obsessive', 'same', 'time', 'Robert', 'Jeffrey', 'become', 'lovers', 'plot', 'headlong', 'intriguing', 'twists', 'relating', 'Internet', 'chat', 'rooms', 'layering', 'deceptions', 'lead', 'fatalistic', 'conclusion.Once', 'again', 'proving', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'audacious', 'actors', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'fearlessly', 'fey', 'quality', 'Robert', 'character', 'harden', 'encroaching', 'deceptions', 'envelop', 'Looking', 'very', 'much', 'part', 'patrician', 'artistically', 'frustrated', 'Hollywood', 'wife', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'typically', 'sharp', 'insightful', 'performance', 'Elaine', 'especially', 'efforts', 'manipulate', 'Robert', 'backfire', 'own', 'unfolding', 'painful', 'situation', 'What', 'very', 'well', 'show', 'vulnerability', 'character', 'regardless', 'misogynistic', 'intentions', 'stentorian', 'voice', 'used', 'ideal', 'context', 'Campbell', 'Scott', 'finally', 'fire', 'late', 'parents', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'Colleen', 'Dewhurst', 'exposing', 'deviously', 'powerful', 'character', 'Jeffrey', 'ultimately', 'rendered', 'powerless', 'circumstances.Although', 'movie', 'advantage', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'locations', 'including', 'stunning', 'hilltop', 'home', 'complete', 'infinity', 'pool', 'course', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'play', 'especially', 'Lucas', 'use', 'talking', 'headshots', 'voiceovers', 'amplify', 'ennui', 'chat', 'room', 'activity', 'Where', 'film', 'somewhat', 'awry', 'series', 'developments', 'last', 'half-hour', 'lead', 'ending', 'where', 'Robert', 'sense', 'paranoia', 'brings', 'certain', 'facts', 'light', 'become', 'increasingly', 'contrived', 'Regardless', 'Lucas', 'gift', 'smart', 'dialogue', 'three', 'performances', 'lend', 'credence', 'wildly', 'implausible', 'developments', 'hoopla', 'wondrous', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'just', 'saw', 'will', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'Jeffrey', 'mercenary', 'comments', 'box-office', 'poison', 'gay-themed', 'films', 'will', 'remain', 'true']",N/A

967425,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000E3L7E6,Grady Harp,"[10, 11]","THE DYING GAUL, written and directed by Craig Lucas (writing credits include 'Longtime Companion', 'Prelude to a Kiss', 'Reckless') is a brilliant little film that stirred comment and appreciation during its unfortunately very brief run in the theaters (as one of the film's characters comments ""Most Americans hate gay people. If they hear it's about gay people, they won't go."")  And this in a year when films such as 'Brokeback Mountain', 'Transamerica', and 'Capote' drew focus.  As the oft used phrase states, 'Go figure'.The story is a bizarre triangle of interaction among three very bright, enlightened, yet passionately isolated people whose coming together is the stuff of tragedy on the grand scale.  Robert Sandrich (Peter Sarsgaard) is a grieving screenwriter (his lover recently died from complications of AIDS in a manner secretly gnawing at Robert).  His most recent screenplay 'The Dying Gaul' about a gay couple - one with AIDS - is a tribute to his lover, and while it is a brilliant script and is taken on by a top film producer Jeffrey Tishop (Campbell Scott), Jeffrey offers to buy the script for a million dollars IF Robert re-writes the script to make the couple a heterosexual one (see above for his reason).  Robert at first refuses to 'sell out' but eventually gives in and does the re-write.  Jeffrey is married to a very bright ex-screenwriter Elaine (Patricia Clarkson) who reads Robert's script, loves the original and becomes so obsessed with the script and with Robert that she plunges into an investigation of Robert's life.  Compounding the intrigue is the fact that Jeffrey begins to fall in love with Robert and Robert is so needy emotionally that he responds: the two become lovers.  Elaine enters Robert's private life via chat room discussion where she poses as the voice of Robert's dead lover and inadvertently discovers secrets that eventually bring the trio to a devastating climax: secrets are revealed that demand accountability and each character is permanently altered.Craig Lucas, in this his first directorial outing, proves to be an artist with style, with vision, and with guts to put tough material into visual form.  The pacing is tense; the ideas are well developed from the meaning of the title to the cruelty of the machine mode means of conversation via email chat rooms.  He handles sexuality variations as well as any director today.  He of course is blessed with a trio of superlative actors: Sarsgaard, Clarkson and Campbell give extraordinary performances. The cinematography by Bobby Bukowski revels in the brilliance of the California sun at poolside as well as the eerie light from the computer screen in darkened rooms - further underlining the alienation that medium demands.  And the crowning addition is a musical score by gifted composer Steve Reich (one of the finest of today's classical composers).  THE DYING GAUL is a tough film but one that is so refreshingly dedicated to its vision that it scores as a major work.  Highly Recommended.

Robert's story is based on the death of his lover Malcolm from AIDS. Jeffrey convinces Robert to change the gay characters to heterosexuals, saying that nobody goes to see movies about gay subjects. (I wonder what he would say post-BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN although I do not believe THE DYING GAUL got much attention by theater-goers. It should have.)The film makes statements about death, relationships, fidelity-- Jeffrey's contract with Elaine is that they do not talk about extramarital affairs and the person involved cannot be a mutual friend-- Buddhism, honesty-- weighty topics. The story has interesting turns with hints along the way as to the ending. Note that Jeffery in the closing frames takes the exact position of the famous Greek statue of the dying Gaul.The actors do a fine job. Peter Sarsgaard is particularly convincing as Robert. There are some beautiful sex scenes between Jeffrey and Robert done in silhouette to please the censors. My only complaint is that at times the soundtrack gets a little obtrusive.This film deserves a much larger audience.",5,A Movie Well Worth Watching,1145664000,"04 22, 2006",2006,1565,"['really', 'good', 'movie', 'directed', 'Craig', 'Lucas', 'first', 'go', 'directing', 'written', 'other', 'fine', 'films', 'including', 'LONGTIME', 'COMPANION', 'PRELUDE', 'TO', 'A', 'KISS', 'Robert', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'KINSEY', 'script', 'THE', 'DYING', 'GAUL', 'TO', 'Jeffrey', 'played', 'Scott', 'Campbell', 'LONGTIME', 'COMPANION', 'well-to-do', 'film', 'executive', 'wife', 'Elaine', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'seen', 'recently', 'GOOD', 'NIGHT', 'AND', 'GOOD', 'LUCK', 'live', 'home', 'were', 'designed', 'architect', 'Richard', 'Meier', 'Robert', 'story', 'based', 'death', 'lover', 'Malcolm', 'AIDS', 'Jeffrey', 'Robert', 'change', 'gay', 'characters', 'heterosexuals', 'saying', 'nobody', 'see', 'movies', 'gay', 'subjects', 'wonder', 'what', 'would', 'say', 'post-BROKEBACK', 'MOUNTAIN', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'THE', 'DYING', 'GAUL', 'got', 'much', 'attention', 'theater-goers', 'should', 'have', 'film', 'statements', 'death', 'relationships', 'fidelity', 'Jeffrey', 'contract', 'Elaine', 'do', 'not', 'talk', 'extramarital', 'affairs', 'person', 'involved', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'mutual', 'friend', 'Buddhism', 'honesty', 'weighty', 'topics', 'story', 'interesting', 'turns', 'hints', 'way', 'ending', 'Note', 'Jeffery', 'closing', 'frames', 'exact', 'position', 'famous', 'Greek', 'statue', 'dying', 'Gaul.The', 'actors', 'do', 'fine', 'job', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'particularly', 'convincing', 'Robert', 'are', 'beautiful', 'sex', 'scenes', 'Jeffrey', 'Robert', 'done', 'silhouette', 'please', 'censors', 'only', 'complaint', 'times', 'soundtrack', 'little', 'obtrusive.This', 'film', 'much', 'larger', 'audience']",N/A

967429,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000E3L7E6,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 3]","""The Dying Gaul"" is the name of an ancient Roman marble statue, which is believed to be a copy of a lost ancient Greek statue.  It is a realistic depiction of a dying Celt, naked except for neck torc, a wound in his side indicative of the deathblow that will claim his life.  ""The Dying Gaul"" is also the name of not only this 2005 film from writer-director Craig Lucas (writer of ""Prelude to a Kiss"" and ""Reckless""), but of the script that Robert Sandrich (Peter Sarsgaard) is shopping around Hollywood.  The script is the story of two gay men, one of whom is dying, and Robert sees the famous statue as a metaphor.However, Producer Jeffrey Tishop (Campbell Scott) loves the story, but sees no profit in making a movie about two gay guys in love.  After all, the two guys that ""Philadelphia"" was about were not the lovers and ""Brokeback Mountain"" is not in release yet.  The deal Jeffrey offers is to pay Robert $1 million to revise the script into a heterosexual love story, where ""Maurice"" becomes ""Maggie,"" who is dying of AIDS.  This cuts close to the heart with Robert because ""Maurice"" was based on Malcolm, his lover, who is now dead.  Consequently, agreeing to this deal is an act of betrayal on several levels for Robert.  But then we get to the first two twists in this one.I checked out this movie because it seemed every week its trailer was on a DVD I was watching.  So I thought this was a movie about a writer selling his soul to get a movie made.  The movie even begins with a quotation from Herman Melville's ""Moby Dick,"" which warns, ""Woe to him who seeks to please rather than to appall.""  But it turns out ""The Dying Gaul"" is about another deal, because Jeffrey turns out to want another part of Robert's anatomy.  That would be the first twist and we now realize that the producer's attempts to seduce the writer at that initial meeting literally was an attempt at seduction.  The second is when Jeffrey's wife, Elaine (Patricia Clarkson), discovers the two men are having an affair, and what she decides to do about it.This film was originally a play, which may well explain why it is that so many key scenes take place in an Internet chat room accompanied (in the film) by voiceovers.  But Lucas the director does not serve his cast as well as he does as a writer, and there are several scenes where the artistic elements overwhelm what is happening.  Still, the three main actors turn in fine performances and the ending is appropriately twisted given the situation that has been contrived.  People do not have to be monsters to do monstrous things, and the character arcs of Robert, Stephen and Elaine would suggest they are not monsters.  But in the jungle that is Hollywood evil must be repaid in kind.",4,Fine performances in a twisted psychological thriller from Craig Lucas,1144368000,"04 7, 2006",2006,2730,"['Dying', 'Gaul', 'name', 'ancient', 'Roman', 'marble', 'statue', 'believed', 'be', 'copy', 'lost', 'ancient', 'Greek', 'statue', 'realistic', 'depiction', 'dying', 'Celt', 'naked', 'neck', 'torc', 'wound', 'side', 'indicative', 'deathblow', 'will', 'claim', 'life', 'Dying', 'Gaul', 'also', 'name', 'not', 'only', '2005', 'film', 'writer-director', 'Craig', 'Lucas', 'writer', 'Prelude', 'Kiss', 'Reckless', 'script', 'Robert', 'Sandrich', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'shopping', 'around', 'Hollywood', 'script', 'story', 'two', 'gay', 'men', 'one', 'whom', 'dying', 'Robert', 'famous', 'statue', 'metaphor.However', 'Producer', 'Jeffrey', 'Tishop', 'Campbell', 'Scott', 'story', 'profit', 'making', 'movie', 'two', 'gay', 'guys', 'love', 'two', 'guys', 'Philadelphia', 'was', 'were', 'not', 'lovers', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'not', 'release', 'yet', 'deal', 'Jeffrey', 'pay', 'Robert', '1', 'million', 'revise', 'script', 'heterosexual', 'love', 'story', 'where', 'Maurice', 'Maggie', 'who', 'dying', 'AIDS', 'close', 'heart', 'Robert', 'Maurice', 'was', 'based', 'Malcolm', 'lover', 'who', 'now', 'dead', 'Consequently', 'agreeing', 'deal', 'act', 'betrayal', 'several', 'levels', 'Robert', 'then', 'get', 'first', 'two', 'twists', 'one.I', 'checked', 'out', 'movie', 'seemed', 'week', 'trailer', 'was', 'DVD', 'was', 'watching', 'thought', 'was', 'movie', 'writer', 'selling', 'soul', 'get', 'movie', 'made', 'movie', 'even', 'quotation', 'Herman', 'Melville', 'Moby', 'Dick', 'Woe', 'who', 'please', 'rather', 'appall', 'out', 'Dying', 'Gaul', 'deal', 'Jeffrey', 'out', 'want', 'part', 'Robert', 'anatomy', 'would', 'be', 'first', 'twist', 'now', 'realize', 'producer', 'attempts', 'seduce', 'writer', 'initial', 'meeting', 'literally', 'was', 'attempt', 'seduction', 'second', 'when', 'Jeffrey', 'wife', 'Elaine', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'two', 'men', 'are', 'having', 'affair', 'what', 'do', 'it.This', 'film', 'was', 'originally', 'play', 'may', 'well', 'explain', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'key', 'scenes', 'take', 'place', 'Internet', 'chat', 'room', 'accompanied', 'film', 'voiceovers', 'Lucas', 'director', 'not', 'serve', 'cast', 'as', 'well', 'writer', 'are', 'several', 'scenes', 'where', 'artistic', 'elements', 'overwhelm', 'what', 'happening', 'Still', 'three', 'main', 'actors', 'turn', 'fine', 'performances', 'ending', 'appropriately', 'twisted', 'given', 'situation', 'been', 'contrived', 'People', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'be', 'monsters', 'do', 'monstrous', 'things', 'character', 'arcs', 'Robert', 'Stephen', 'Elaine', 'would', 'suggest', 'are', 'not', 'monsters', 'jungle', 'Hollywood', 'evil', 'must', 'be', 'repaid', 'kind']",N/A
