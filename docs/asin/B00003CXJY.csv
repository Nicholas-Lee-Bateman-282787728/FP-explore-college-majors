The special agents Malcom(Martin Lawrence) and his other sidekick must get to Sherry in order to capture Lester. Malcom dresses as Sherry's grandmother.

The film is beyond wrong, it is not funny, very predictible, short, at least is short, and has not even one good joke. The story is not believable, come on. Martin Lawrence is and will never be a good actor, The only actor that passes is Paul Giamatti, but bearly. I would have fallen asleep if the sound wasn't loud in the movies. I was so sad the entire movie since I mised my chance of watching GLADIATOR again, which was the other movie in the cinema. I went with my cousin, and she loved it, I wanted to hit her, just as I want to hit the person responsible for this insult, I want my money back. Any one who likes this movie is a true stupid, which is what this movie is, an boring hour for stupids.

527492,AT54Q2ERA4PBR,B00003CXJY,Ben J Korgen,"[1, 1]","This movie has three distinct plots, not in order but overlaid with each other, intertwined with humor and timed to reach a belly-laughing and mind-blowing grand finale.  The plots are a comedy, a crime thriller and a serious love story.  A charming sub-plot involves a young boy's adjustment to developments in the love story.  The comedy centers around a real, 400 pound Big Momma (Ella Mitchell) and a fake Big Momma which is FBI agent Malcolm (Martin Lawrence)wearing an incredibly accurate and life-like fake Big Momma disguise.  Malcolm is intent on solving a major bank robbery crime and gets a lead that the thief's girlfriend Sherry (Nia Long) lives in a small Southern town across from the real Big Momma's home.  He learns that the real Big Momma will be out of town and decides that he and his assistant John (Paul Giamatti) should set up a stake-out in the real Big Momma's house across the street from Sherry's house, hoping that the thief will expose himself by visiting Sherry.  Malcolm also learns that Big Momma is close to Sherry, manages to hear and imitate Big Momma's voice, then dons the disguise as Big Momma and uses it to get close to Sherry.  This opens the possibility of a romance from Malcolm's side, but not from Sherry's perspective since she thinks she is talking to the real Big Momma.  This difficulty becomes comical and is made more comical by the ongoing friction-loaded and slapstick relationship that develops between Malcolm, who is creative and impulsive and John who is regulation-bound and filled with reservations concerning what could go wrong in their efforts. In time, Malcolm emerges from his disguise, allowing he and Sherry to fall in love.  The movie's ending reveals that Sherry has a son, who the son's father is, how the son acclimates to Malcolm's interest in his mother, who the thief is and where the money is hidden.  If you think endless belly laughs are essential to your health, see this one.",5,"Raja Gosnell Directs Martin Lawrence, Nia Long and Paul Giamatti In Hilarious Triple-Treat Movie",1380844800,"10 4, 2013",2013,1954,"['movie', 'three', 'distinct', 'plots', 'not', 'order', 'overlaid', 'other', 'intertwined', 'humor', 'timed', 'reach', 'belly-laughing', 'mind-blowing', 'grand', 'finale', 'plots', 'are', 'comedy', 'crime', 'thriller', 'serious', 'love', 'story', 'charming', 'sub-plot', 'young', 'boy', 'adjustment', 'developments', 'love', 'story', 'comedy', 'centers', 'real', '400', 'pound', 'Big', 'Momma', 'Ella', 'Mitchell', 'fake', 'Big', 'Momma', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Malcolm', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', 'wearing', 'incredibly', 'accurate', 'life-like', 'fake', 'Big', 'Momma', 'disguise', 'Malcolm', 'intent', 'solving', 'major', 'bank', 'robbery', 'crime', 'lead', 'thief', 'girlfriend', 'Sherry', 'Nia', 'Long', 'small', 'Southern', 'town', 'real', 'Big', 'Momma', 'home', 'real', 'Big', 'Momma', 'will', 'be', 'town', 'assistant', 'John', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'should', 'set', 'up', 'stake-out', 'real', 'Big', 'Momma', 'house', 'street', 'Sherry', 'house', 'hoping', 'thief', 'will', 'expose', 'visiting', 'Sherry', 'Malcolm', 'also', 'Big', 'Momma', 'close', 'Sherry', 'hear', 'imitate', 'Big', 'Momma', 'voice', 'then', 'disguise', 'Big', 'Momma', 'get', 'close', 'Sherry', 'possibility', 'romance', 'Malcolm', 'side', 'not', 'Sherry', 'perspective', 'talking', 'real', 'Big', 'Momma', 'difficulty', 'comical', 'made', 'more', 'comical', 'ongoing', 'friction-loaded', 'slapstick', 'relationship', 'Malcolm', 'who', 'creative', 'impulsive', 'John', 'who', 'regulation-bound', 'filled', 'reservations', 'concerning', 'what', 'could', 'go', 'wrong', 'efforts', 'time', 'Malcolm', 'disguise', 'allowing', 'Sherry', 'fall', 'love', 'movie', 'ending', 'reveals', 'Sherry', 'son', 'who', 'son', 'father', 'how', 'son', 'Malcolm', 'interest', 'mother', 'who', 'thief', 'where', 'money', 'hidden', 'think', 'endless', 'belly', 'laughs', 'are', 'essential', 'health', 'see', 'one']",Big Momma's House

If you've ever witnessed someone doing or saying something so stupid,low and crass that you had to laugh in spite of yourself, then this movie fits the bill. One of the strongest draws of this movie is its unusually strong cast of talented actors, who make the most out of what they are given. Like most comedies in this vein, you have to suspend your disbelief much of the time:  the plot of this situational comedy is highly improbable, but sometimes quite funny. Martin Lawrence won't make you forget Eddie Murphy's star turn in the First ""Nutty Professor"" remake, but he does have some surprisingly amusing moments impersonating ""Big Momma"" while in pursuit of a criminal who is on the lam. Nia Long, his love interest, is as cool and ravishing as ever. Ella Mitchell gamely plays the real Big Momma and, best of all, Anthony Anderson is uproariously funny as a bumbling security guard who moonlights giving self-defense classes to elderly women in the neighborhood community center.  As most reviewers here have indicated, ""Big Momma's House"" is definitely not worth agonizing about.  It's the film equivalent of pleasantly disposable junk food.

527515,A1Q1PP3Z4QDUQM,B00003CXJY,Farffleblex Plaffington,"[6, 6]","The biggest problem with Big Momma's house is that you can often see just how funny it should be, but the cast and crew are not able to sustain the occasional hilarious parts with any consistency.It doesn't seem to help that Big Momma's House wants to be more than a comedy.  Writers Darryl Quarles and Don Rhymer shoot for a combination of a crime comedy ala Beverly Hills Cop (1984) and a romantic comedy.  But the core comedy is absurdist, while the mostly serious crime stuff is so underwritten that it would be better absent, and the somewhat serious rom-com stuff is so generic and predictable that it has all the surprise of attending Mass.To me, the comedy being absurdist is a plus, but it doesn't mesh well with other modes.  It's ridiculous, of course, that Malcolm Turner (Martin Lawrence) is trying to pass himself off as ""Big Momma"" Hattie Mae Pierce (Ella Mitchell).  That's a large part of what makes it funny.  However, director Raja Gosnell's decision to play the rest of the cast as mostly deadpan is a strange one.  It leads the viewer to take the film in a more realist mode, but if you're doing that, you keep asking yourself why anyone else would believe that Turner is actually Big Momma.  Gosnell should have gone for another approach during the Turner as Big Momma scenes.  It's not that they're never funny, but too often the deadpan interaction breaks the humor.However, the deadpan attitude works wonders when Mitchell is Big Momma.  Mitchell is a fantastic here as a comic actress and especially Paul Giamatti as John is hilarious interacting with her.  Once those too-brief scenes ended, I was wishing they wouldn't have, and when they reappeared again at the end, it made me more fully realize how much better they were.  A whole film could have and should have been written around Mitchell as Big Momma with Giamatti and Lawrence interacting with her and beautiful co-star Nia Long via some other story.Even with these problems, Big Momma is an enjoyable film.  My wife enjoyed it even more than I did, we're looking forward to watching Big Momma's House 2, and we'll certainly watch this again in the future.

527527,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00003CXJY,Matthew Horner,"[2, 9]","Big Momma's House was a huge hit for Fox Studios, which had gone through a yearlong dry spell. Much of the reason for its success is that Hollywood has finally realized that there is a big urban market, composed mainly of young Afro-Americans, with plenty of disposable income and an obvious fondness for movies. What the industry may not know is that the novelty of having more movies aimed towards this audience will wear off. When this happens, the product will need to improve. Take Big Momma's House as an example. If it had had mainly a white cast and starred Robin Williams, it probably would have died after its opening weekend. Different audience groups vary in what they think is funny, but lazy movie making such as this effort eventually ends up discouraging the intended target.Martin Lawrence is Malcolm, a FBI agent whose skills include impersonating people. Nolan [Anthony Anderson] is a dangerous criminal who has just escaped from prison. The Feds assume he will head for the $2,000,000 he stole in his last heist. His old girlfriend Sherry [Nia Long] is put under surveillance because she may or may not know where the money is. Before they can properly stake her out, Sherry flees to Georgia with her young son. Malcolm and his partner are assigned to follow her. They think she is going to her grandmother's house. Before Sherry can contact Big Momma, the woman leaves town. Malcolm decides to impersonate her. Sherry winds up believing Malcolm is Big Momma, Malcolm falls for Sherry, and the movie gets progressively sillier.Seeing a man dressed as a woman is not in itself necessarily inherently funny. The humor resides in how the man reacts to being in this role, as in his getting accustomed to such attire and in his discovery that his feminine side is starting to show. Great examples of this are Dustin Hoffman in Tootsie, Eddie Murphy in The Nutty Professor and Robin Williams in Mrs. Doubtfire. In those movies, it was necessary for the actors to be convincing because the story depended on it. The plot of Big Momma's House also requires believability, But Martin Lawrence seems uncomfortable in his role. He often contorts his face and rolls his eyes as if to say to the audience that he is really a man. The audience knows this, and his tentative approach to being Big Momma becomes irritating.The people who wrote this movie should learn that, while humor can be crude, all things crude are not humorous. There is a scene near the beginning that takes bathroom humor to a new low, not that it was very high to begin with. I am not at all a prude. I realize we live in times which are basically wide open. I simply didn't find the scene amusing. Of course, I didn't find much of the movie to be that funny.",2,"Crude can be funny, but not in this 'House""",1016409600,"03 18, 2002",2002,2740,"['Big', 'Momma', 'House', 'was', 'huge', 'hit', 'Fox', 'Studios', 'had', 'gone', 'yearlong', 'dry', 'spell', 'Much', 'reason', 'success', 'Hollywood', 'finally', 'realized', 'big', 'urban', 'market', 'composed', 'mainly', 'young', 'Afro-Americans', 'plenty', 'disposable', 'income', 'obvious', 'fondness', 'movies', 'What', 'industry', 'may', 'not', 'know', 'novelty', 'having', 'more', 'movies', 'aimed', 'towards', 'audience', 'will', 'wear', 'off', 'When', 'product', 'will', 'need', 'improve', 'Take', 'Big', 'Momma', 'House', 'example', 'had', 'had', 'mainly', 'white', 'cast', 'starred', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'died', 'opening', 'weekend', 'Different', 'audience', 'groups', 'vary', 'what', 'think', 'funny', 'lazy', 'movie', 'making', 'such', 'effort', 'eventually', 'up', 'discouraging', 'intended', 'target.Martin', 'Lawrence', 'Malcolm', 'FBI', 'agent', 'skills', 'include', 'impersonating', 'people', 'Nolan', '[', 'Anthony', 'Anderson', ']', 'dangerous', 'criminal', 'who', 'just', 'escaped', 'prison', 'Feds', 'assume', 'will', 'head', '2,000,000', 'stole', 'last', 'heist', 'old', 'girlfriend', 'Sherry', '[', 'Nia', 'Long', ']', 'put', 'surveillance', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'know', 'where', 'money', 'can', 'properly', 'stake', 'out', 'Sherry', 'Georgia', 'young', 'son', 'Malcolm', 'partner', 'are', 'assigned', 'follow', 'think', 'going', 'grandmother', 'house', 'Sherry', 'can', 'contact', 'Big', 'Momma', 'woman', 'town', 'Malcolm', 'impersonate', 'Sherry', 'up', 'believing', 'Malcolm', 'Big', 'Momma', 'Malcolm', 'Sherry', 'movie', 'progressively', 'sillier.Seeing', 'man', 'dressed', 'woman', 'not', 'necessarily', 'inherently', 'funny', 'humor', 'resides', 'how', 'man', 'being', 'role', 'getting', 'accustomed', 'such', 'attire', 'discovery', 'feminine', 'side', 'starting', 'show', 'Great', 'are', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Tootsie', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'Nutty', 'Professor', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Mrs.', 'Doubtfire', 'movies', 'was', 'necessary', 'actors', 'be', 'convincing', 'story', 'depended', 'plot', 'Big', 'Momma', 'House', 'also', 'believability', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', 'uncomfortable', 'role', 'often', 'face', 'eyes', 'say', 'audience', 'really', 'man', 'audience', 'tentative', 'approach', 'being', 'Big', 'Momma', 'irritating.The', 'people', 'who', 'wrote', 'movie', 'should', 'learn', 'humor', 'can', 'be', 'crude', 'things', 'crude', 'are', 'not', 'humorous', 'scene', 'beginning', 'bathroom', 'humor', 'new', 'low', 'not', 'was', 'very', 'high', 'begin', 'am', 'not', 'prude', 'realize', 'live', 'times', 'are', 'basically', 'wide', 'open', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'scene', 'amusing', 'course', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'much', 'movie', 'be', 'funny']",Big Momma's House

527540,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00003CXJY,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 0]","In ""Big Momma's House,"" Martin Lawrence goes the &quot;Some Like it Hot/Tootsie/Mrs. Doubtfire&quot; route, dressing up in drag and embroiling himself in a mess of plot complications - just as Jack Lemmon, Tony Curtis, Dustin Hoffman, Robin Williams and a whole host of other comic actors have done before him.  This is practically a rite of passage for any movie comedian, harking back to a tradition that is as old as drama itself.  You really can't go too wrong with this cross dressing scenario, particularly if you happen to have a talented comic actor buried under all the makeup.  Luckily, this is the case here.  ""Big Momma's House"" may be far from original in its premise and execution, but the film does manage to deliver its fair share of laughs - enough, at least, to justify giving it a once-over if you happen to be in the mood for some undemanding, mindless entertainment.In terms of the setup, this film fails to deliver even the modicum of credibility that distinguished its predecessors.  This is mostly due to the fact that, in the previous films, the men in drag were portraying characters no one in the film had ever met before.  Lawrence, on the other hand, is playing the part of an undercover FBI agent who dresses up and passes himself off as a figure named Big Momma who is a well-known person in her family and in her neighborhood.  That he is able to bamboozle all these friends, family members and acquaintances into believing he is indeed Big Momma does require us to suspend our disbelief even more than usual with a story of this type.Be that as it may, the truth is that ""Big Momma's House"" is a fun, fast moving and enjoyable little comedy, due, in no small measure, to Lawrence's skill in bringing the character to life through the expert use of vocal inflections, facial expressions and mannerisms.  The script relies on some fairly conventional slapstick routines involving split second near-misses as well as dialogue that ranges from the clever and sassy to the crude and vulgar.  Still, in comparison to the truly raunchy ""Nutty Professor II,"" ""Big Momma's House"" seems like a genteel Sunday school picnic.""Big Momma's House"" certainly doesn't rank up there with the classics of the genre - ""Tootsie"" or  ""Some Like it Hot"" - but it does get the job done, which is more than can be said for lots of other comedies these days.",3,ridiculous but relatively entertaining,999907200,"09 8, 2001",2001,2365,"['Big', 'Momma', 'House', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', 'quot', 'Hot/Tootsie/Mrs', 'Doubtfire', 'quot', 'route', 'dressing', 'up', 'drag', 'embroiling', 'mess', 'plot', 'complications', 'just', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'Tony', 'Curtis', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'whole', 'host', 'other', 'comic', 'actors', 'have', 'done', 'practically', 'rite', 'passage', 'movie', 'comedian', 'harking', 'back', 'tradition', 'as', 'old', 'drama', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'too', 'wrong', 'cross', 'dressing', 'scenario', 'particularly', 'happen', 'have', 'talented', 'comic', 'actor', 'buried', 'makeup', 'Luckily', 'case', 'here', 'Big', 'Momma', 'House', 'may', 'be', 'far', 'original', 'premise', 'execution', 'film', 'manage', 'deliver', 'fair', 'share', 'laughs', 'enough', 'least', 'justify', 'giving', 'once-over', 'happen', 'be', 'mood', 'undemanding', 'mindless', 'entertainment.In', 'terms', 'setup', 'film', 'deliver', 'even', 'modicum', 'credibility', 'distinguished', 'predecessors', 'mostly', 'due', 'fact', 'previous', 'films', 'men', 'drag', 'were', 'portraying', 'characters', 'one', 'film', 'had', 'ever', 'met', 'before', 'Lawrence', 'other', 'hand', 'playing', 'part', 'undercover', 'FBI', 'agent', 'who', 'up', 'passes', 'off', 'figure', 'named', 'Big', 'Momma', 'who', 'well-known', 'person', 'family', 'neighborhood', 'able', 'bamboozle', 'friends', 'family', 'members', 'acquaintances', 'believing', 'indeed', 'Big', 'Momma', 'require', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'even', 'more', 'usual', 'story', 'type.Be', 'may', 'truth', 'Big', 'Momma', 'House', 'fun', 'fast', 'moving', 'enjoyable', 'little', 'comedy', 'due', 'small', 'measure', 'Lawrence', 'skill', 'bringing', 'character', 'life', 'expert', 'use', 'vocal', 'inflections', 'facial', 'expressions', 'mannerisms', 'script', 'relies', 'fairly', 'conventional', 'slapstick', 'routines', 'involving', 'split', 'second', 'near-misses', 'as', 'well', 'dialogue', 'clever', 'sassy', 'crude', 'vulgar', 'Still', 'comparison', 'truly', 'raunchy', 'Nutty', 'Professor', 'II', 'Big', 'Momma', 'House', 'genteel', 'Sunday', 'school', 'picnic', 'Big', 'Momma', 'House', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'rank', 'up', 'there', 'classics', 'genre', 'Tootsie', 'Hot', 'get', 'job', 'done', 'more', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'lots', 'other', 'comedies', 'days']",Big Momma's House
