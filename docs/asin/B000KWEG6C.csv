Tons of extras, such as deleted scenes, outtakes, a audio commentary and a Easter egg.  Of course, there is adult language and jokes, even in the commentary and this is not for little kids, babies, pets, people with heart problems and, no matter what they tell you, don't watch after getting drunk.

When he gets back to the Team the guys all tell him he picked out Pink.  Then there's Caboose and his famous Caboose-isms.
