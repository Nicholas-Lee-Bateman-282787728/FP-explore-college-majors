But the SOUL, that thing that animates a performance and brings life to it and makes it true art, was missing.

The brothers, whose sweet, close harmonies were seminal in early American rock and roll, rockabilly division, are now in their mid-40's, playing together for the first time in ten years: they take the stage with their acoustic guitars, and backing by a select group.  Early in the show, we see Don, the elder brother, answering the questions he must most often have been asked about it, such as why the Albert Hall; he answers that their last show there, ten years ago, was a great triumph, witnessed by their mother and father.  And that, though their parents are gone, they know there's still an appreciative audience there for them, -- and there was -- generations of loyal fans, and musicians they've inspired: Beach Boys, Beatles, and so forth.First and foremost, let it be said, as to the music: the brothers still can rock, and swing, too.  Nor has their famed close harmony suffered from the long absence, as the brothers lean their heads in together the better to work, obviously concentrating hard on the tune at hand.  They open on the lovely ballad ""Crying in the Rain;"" it will be followed-up that evening by several other sweet ballads, including the English folk song ""Barbara Allen,"" and a medley of ""Devoted,"" ""Ebony Eyes,"" and ""Love Hurts."" There's a gorgeous ""All I Have to Do Is Dream,"" delivered heads close together, harmony closer; they close with a quiet, supremely beautiful ""Let It Be Me.""  But the brothers rock, as well. ""Cathy's Clown"" sure swings; so do ""Love Is Strange,"" ""When Will I Be Loved,"" and ""Sad to Watch Good Love Go Bad.""  The brothers rock out on ""Bird Dog,"" ""Be-Bop-a-Lula,"" and ""Until I Kissed You,"" as well as they ever did.  They swing on the rockabilly ""Step It Up and Go,"" and, as they pulled out the stops on ""Lucille,"" they had the crowd standing and stomping.The DVD is a valuable document if you care for early rock, or rockabilly; you might want to add it to your collection.",4,What's Not to Like?,1190937600,"09 28, 2007",2007,2088,"['Everly', 'Brothers', 'Reunion', 'Concert', 'Live', 'Royal', 'Albert', 'Hall', 'London', '1983', 'documents', 'being', 'brought', 'back', 'together', 'long', 'nasty', 'quarrel', 'brothers', 'sweet', 'close', 'harmonies', 'were', 'seminal', 'early', 'American', 'rock', 'roll', 'rockabilly', 'division', 'are', 'now', 'mid-40', 'playing', 'together', 'first', 'time', 'ten', 'years', 'take', 'stage', 'acoustic', 'guitars', 'backing', 'select', 'group', 'Early', 'show', 'see', 'Don', 'elder', 'brother', 'answering', 'questions', 'must', 'most', 'often', 'have', 'been', 'asked', 'such', 'why', 'Albert', 'Hall', 'last', 'show', 'there', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'great', 'triumph', 'witnessed', 'mother', 'father', 'parents', 'are', 'gone', 'know', 'still', 'appreciative', 'audience', 'was', 'generations', 'loyal', 'fans', 'musicians', ""'ve"", 'inspired', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'Beatles', 'so', 'forth.First', 'foremost', 'let', 'be', 'said', 'music', 'brothers', 'still', 'can', 'rock', 'swing', 'too', 'famed', 'close', 'harmony', 'suffered', 'long', 'absence', 'brothers', 'lean', 'heads', 'together', 'better', 'work', 'obviously', 'concentrating', 'hard', 'tune', 'hand', 'open', 'lovely', 'ballad', 'Crying', 'Rain', 'will', 'be', 'followed-up', 'evening', 'several', 'other', 'sweet', 'ballads', 'including', 'English', 'folk', 'song', 'Barbara', 'Allen', 'medley', 'Devoted', 'Ebony', 'Eyes', 'Love', 'Hurts', 'gorgeous', 'Have', 'Do', 'Is', 'Dream', 'delivered', 'heads', 'close', 'together', 'harmony', 'closer', 'close', 'quiet', 'supremely', 'beautiful', 'Let', 'Be', 'Me', 'brothers', 'rock', 'as', 'well', 'Cathy', 'Clown', 'sure', 'swings', 'so', 'do', 'Love', 'Is', 'Strange', 'When', 'Will', 'Be', 'Loved', 'Sad', 'Watch', 'Good', 'Love', 'Go', 'Bad', 'brothers', 'rock', 'out', 'Bird', 'Dog', 'Be-Bop-a-Lula', 'Kissed', 'as', 'well', 'ever', 'did', 'swing', 'rockabilly', 'Step', 'Up', 'Go', 'pulled', 'out', 'stops', 'Lucille', 'had', 'crowd', 'standing', 'stomping.The', 'DVD', 'valuable', 'document', 'care', 'early', 'rock', 'rockabilly', 'might', 'want', 'add', 'collection']",The Everly Brothers Reunion Concert
