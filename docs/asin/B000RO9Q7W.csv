1083201,AMP7TQRWAIE84,B000RO9Q7W,"Adrian Cooper ""That Guy from Venus. :D""","[0, 0]","*MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD!!!*Twisted is what I would say to describe ""Perfect Stranger"". From the beginning, there are little twists that only get deeper as you go along.It starts off with the lead character and decent (enough) actress, Halle Berry, who plays the part of a ""reporter"" if you will, Rowena Price. She is onto something juicy as she tries to blackmail the soon-to-be-senator, Some-random-guy-who's-mildly-attractive-but-pretty-unimportant-until-he-shows-up-as-Senator-way-at-the-end. He's gay, but not openly, and he is pretty outspoken about his thoughts about other gays not being deserving of rights. He tries to get his point across by speaking out against them as a ""closeted straight"", but Rowena has dirt on him; he has written numerous letters to a hot, red-headed gay male (as far as we know, anyway) and she plans to make sure this guy speaks out about the truth, squashing the hypocrite-soon-to-be-Senator's whole image.But the movie gets deeper and more intriguing once Miles, the strangely average but hunky Giovanni Ribisi starts to intrude on other people's emails and IOL convos. She starts going into chat rooms and meets trublu (who we later find out to be Miles himself - he's IN LOVE with Halle's character; even notes later on in the movie, ""Why do strong women date weak men?"" Or something along those lines) and ADEX, who is big shot company owner, Harrison Hill. He's almighty and powerful, but mainly due to his rich wife's upbringing, Mia Hill. She's a very pretty but very, VERY jealous and suspicious wife. She plays behind the scenes mostly, and contacts Harrison's right winged woman and lesbian, Josie.He and Rowena eventually get themselves into trouble when they bite off more they can chew. But before that, a couple of things occur in Rowena's life; she loses her ""online virginity"" by making a screen name, or having one made for her by Miles, and chatting with two men in particular; trublu (who we later find out is Miles all along) and ADEX, the guy she is trying to get dirt on).Anyway, back to the ""bite off more than they can chew""; Miles brainstorms up a plan and thinks that it would be smart if Rowena, who now has a new job, working for someone who works for the current target, Harrison Hill, should install something into his PC to corrupt the data or something.I'm not gonna keep you here all day, but I wanted to hit on the major parts. Rowena ends up being someone you don't expect, as well as Miles himself. If anyone was ""innocent"" throughout this whole story, it was strangely Mr. Harrison Hill, who gets arrested in the end, nonetheless.These are my favorite lines from the movie, which occur at the end, and my new favorite quote!:It starts with a quiet hum, an empty screen inviting you, ""Come inside,"" it says, ""We're always open"". It's a world where you think actions have no consequences. where guilt is cloaked by animinouty (sp?), where there are no fingerprints, an invisible universe, filled with strangers; inter-connected online and disconnected in life. It will steal your secrets, corrupt your dreams and co-opt your identity. Because in this world, where you can be anything you want; Anyone you want. You just might lose sight of who you are...""Everybody has secrets...""If it means anything, I watched this movie twice and it's the best movie I've seen in a long while. I totally disagree with the rating it has right now by a long shot, but what can you do?Almost a 4-star movie.",3,A great movie by Hollywood's standards! 3.9 stars.,1189900800,"09 16, 2007",2007,3460,"['*MINOR', 'SPOILERS', 'AHEAD', '*Twisted', 'what', 'would', 'say', 'describe', 'Perfect', 'Stranger', 'beginning', 'are', 'little', 'twists', 'only', 'get', 'deeper', 'go', 'along.It', 'starts', 'lead', 'character', 'decent', 'enough', 'actress', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'who', 'part', 'reporter', 'will', 'Rowena', 'Price', 'something', 'juicy', 'blackmail', 'soon-to-be-senator', ""Some-random-guy-who's-mildly-attractive-but-pretty-unimportant-until-he-shows-up-as-Senator-way-at-the-end"", 'gay', 'not', 'openly', 'pretty', 'outspoken', 'thoughts', 'other', 'gays', 'not', 'being', 'deserving', 'rights', 'get', 'point', 'speaking', 'out', 'closeted', 'straight', 'Rowena', 'dirt', 'written', 'numerous', 'letters', 'hot', 'red-headed', 'gay', 'male', 'as', 'far', 'know', 'anyway', 'make', 'sure', 'guy', 'out', 'truth', 'squashing', 'hypocrite-soon-to-be-Senator', 'whole', 'image.But', 'movie', 'deeper', 'more', 'intriguing', 'once', 'Miles', 'strangely', 'average', 'hunky', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'intrude', 'other', 'people', 'emails', 'IOL', 'convos', 'going', 'chat', 'rooms', 'meets', 'trublu', 'who', 'later', 'find', 'out', 'be', 'Miles', 'IN', 'LOVE', 'Halle', 'character', 'even', 'later', 'movie', 'Why', 'do', 'strong', 'women', 'date', 'weak', 'men', 'something', 'lines', 'ADEX', 'who', 'big', 'shot', 'company', 'owner', 'Harrison', 'Hill', 'almighty', 'powerful', 'mainly', 'due', 'rich', 'wife', 'upbringing', 'Mia', 'Hill', 'very', 'pretty', 'very', 'VERY', 'jealous', 'suspicious', 'wife', 'scenes', 'mostly', 'Harrison', 'right', 'winged', 'woman', 'lesbian', 'Josie.He', 'Rowena', 'eventually', 'get', 'trouble', 'when', 'bite', 'off', 'more', 'can', 'chew', 'couple', 'things', 'occur', 'Rowena', 'life', 'online', 'virginity', 'making', 'screen', 'name', 'having', 'one', 'made', 'Miles', 'chatting', 'two', 'men', 'particular', 'trublu', 'who', 'later', 'find', 'out', 'Miles', 'all', 'along', 'ADEX', 'guy', 'trying', 'get', 'dirt', '.Anyway', 'back', 'bite', 'off', 'more', 'can', 'chew', 'Miles', 'up', 'plan', 'would', 'be', 'smart', 'Rowena', 'who', 'now', 'new', 'job', 'working', 'someone', 'who', 'current', 'target', 'Harrison', 'Hill', 'should', 'install', 'something', 'PC', 'corrupt', 'data', 'something.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'gon', 'keep', 'here', 'day', 'wanted', 'hit', 'major', 'parts', 'Rowena', 'up', 'being', 'someone', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'as', 'well', 'Miles', 'anyone', 'was', 'innocent', 'whole', 'story', 'was', 'strangely', 'Mr.', 'Harrison', 'Hill', 'who', 'arrested', 'end', 'nonetheless.These', 'are', 'favorite', 'lines', 'movie', 'occur', 'end', 'new', 'favorite', 'quote', 'quiet', 'hum', 'empty', 'screen', 'inviting', 'Come', 'inside', ""'re"", 'always', 'open', 'world', 'where', 'think', 'actions', 'have', 'consequences', 'where', 'guilt', 'cloaked', 'animinouty', 'sp', 'where', 'are', 'fingerprints', 'invisible', 'universe', 'filled', 'strangers', 'inter-connected', 'online', 'disconnected', 'life', 'will', 'steal', 'secrets', 'corrupt', 'dreams', 'co-opt', 'identity', 'world', 'where', 'can', 'be', 'anything', 'want', 'Anyone', 'want', 'just', 'might', 'lose', 'sight', 'who', 'are', 'Everybody', 'secrets', 'anything', 'watched', 'movie', 'twice', 'best', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'while', 'totally', 'disagree', 'rating', 'right', 'now', 'long', 'shot', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'Almost', '4-star', 'movie']",N/A

In trying too hard to have a twisted plot, the writers neglected to give us admirable characters. There is so much pin-pointing and flip-flopping, that Perfect Stranger becomes irrelevant as a movie.

Even Giovani Ribisi, who I consider one of the unsung, but one of the most talented actors of today, can't save this movie from sinking to new lows.I would only recommend this movie to Berry's die-hard fans, and then only when it plays on demand or as a Netflix rental.",2,How far would you go to keep this movie from being released?,1195516800,"11 20, 2007",2007,813,"['was', 'severely', 'disappointed', 'advance', 'screening', 'new', 'Halle', 'Berry-Bruce', 'Willis', 'vehicle', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'have', 'twisted', 'plot', 'writers', 'neglected', 'give', 'admirable', 'characters', 'so', 'much', 'pin-pointing', 'flip-flopping', 'Perfect', 'Stranger', 'irrelevant', 'movie', 'one', 'fate', 'characters', 'fate', 'inconsequential', 'audience', 'bored', 'movie.The', 'movie', 'stars', 'try', 'do', 'admirable', 'job', 'saving', 'script', 'efforts', 'can', 'go', 'only', 'so', 'far', 'Even', 'Giovani', 'Ribisi', 'who', 'consider', 'one', 'unsung', 'one', 'most', 'talented', 'actors', 'today', 'ca', ""n't"", 'save', 'movie', 'sinking', 'new', 'lows.I', 'would', 'only', 'recommend', 'movie', 'Berry', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'then', 'only', 'when', 'demand', 'Netflix', 'rental']",N/A

When will Hollywood get it through their very hard heads even the Interracial relationship could not save this bad movie.  Besides the fact Hollywood is single minded about race as it is anyway.  We see a great deal of Black female, White male, but no Black male, White female.  I mean why not Gweneth Paltrow, and Lawrence Fishburn?  No, well maybe Nicole Kidman, and Taye Diggs?  I mean come on interracial dating does go both ways, and even interracial marriage.Seems though Hollywood is unaware of these facts, and they can only present these relations one way.  Why?  What is really sad though movies which have attempted to reflect interracial relationships Black male, White female are not good quality movies.  A good high budget movie with a good plot, and a good story line.  It happens this way in real life, you know.Even worse this kind of one sided view of interracial relationships reach all the way into children's programming, and even Madison Avenue is guilty.  What message are we trying to send to our children, Black males are persona non gratae?When was the last time you saw a top White female star on screen with a Black man as her love interest?  Though believe me with this movie it would not have helped, this very tacky presentation, or make it profitable.  I do hope Hollywood will try to be more realistic in future presentations of this nature, and realize it is a good idea the show some true balance.

Great actors, an interesting and unique premise, just the right amount of excitement, and a halfway decent twist at the end!""Perfect Strangers"" takes audiences on a thrilling journey as one woman fights to uncover the truth behind the murder of a childhood friend. After evidence suggests Rowena's ex-friend, Grace, was murdered by a millionaire married man she had met on the internet, Rowena goes undercover at Harrison Hill's ad agency to try to gather enough evidence to put him away. With the help of her technologically savvy friend, Rowena begins an illicit online affair with the target of her investigation -- but as usual, things are not always what they seem...I really enjoyed this film. It held my attention, and kept me interested. A couple times I thought I had figured out the twist, but I was pleasantly surprised to discover I was wrong (don't worry, I won't give anything away!). Interestingly enough, they actually filmed 3 different endings -- each one with a different person as the killer. I'm satisfied with the ending they chose, but it would have been nice to see the other 2 alternate endings in the form of a special feature. Sadly, the only special features available on this disc are a ""making of"" featurette, and a couple trailers. I would have really liked to see more special features.As thrillers go, I think this is a solid film. Bruce Willis's character was a little stoic and one-dimensional, but in a quiet, creepy sort of way (which overall works to the benefit of the movie). Halle Berry is beautiful as ever, and even though I'm not sure the chemistry between Ms. Berry and Mr. Willis was exactly electric, I think they did what they could with the material, and played off each other fairly well.One of the things I liked most about this movie was that it was very adult. More and more often, studios are watering down the material to obtain a PG-13 rating in the hopes of appealing to a wider (i.e. old and young) audience. This movie is rated R, and it's not afraid to show it. There's sex, violence, and language -- but it also doesn't rely too heavily on disgusting gore to get it's point across (although, admittedly, there are a few disturbing images -- but again, it doesn't overdo it too much).Bottom line, don't miss out.

Too often these days, good movies are too few and far between. You can go to the video store and spend money out the wazzooo trying to find the good ones and usually end up being disappointed. I figured if all the critics hated it, then it was probably a safe bet disappointment. Yet, if PERFECT STRANGER hadn't had Bruce Willis on the cover, I probably wouldn't have taken the chance on it.My wife decided to put it in last night when I needed to sleep and get up early for work. Needless to say, I stayed up 2 hours later than I should have, watching this intriguing and constantly interesting film.PERFECT STRANGER delves into the life of a tabloid journalist who dives into her stories and rakes up the deepest of mud in the most prominent of personalities. So when a story she worked hard on is thrown away because it targeted a large contributor of her employer's and an old friend resurfaces with fresh dirt on a new subject, Rowena Price (Halle Berry) sinks herself into a new story.PERFECT STRANGER is one of those films that twists and turns and I appreciated the fact that it didn't insult our intelligence. It kept things in the realm of possibility and it was never dummied down. It was at times offensive and didn't hold back any punches. I also appreciated the fact that Bruce Willis, who played ad executive Harrison Hill, could have very well overpowered the film and its other actors, but he played his part wisely; low key at times, explosive at times, and always mysterious.PERFECT STRANGER was a complete surprise, that is if you listen to the critics. It is certainly a good film and better than most of the run of the mill junk out there. Rent. Buy.

But it may be difficult to like while viewing it for the first time because there are many relevant things in the plot that are not shown in the proper time sequence.  By that I mean that there are essential plot developments missing that take place very early in the childhood of Rowan (Halle Berry).  That is the missing link to the whole story which only becomes apparent at the very end, when Rowan's journalist partner Miles talks about them and other important event that happened later.  For that reason most of the movie has this strange feeling to it that the viewers will probably feel that they are missing something.  But it all becomes clear in the end, in a very drastic and suspensful way.  It is at the end when we are finally told why certain things happened, and why people acted the way they did.Like I wrote the movie may seem and is rather slow in its development towards explaining what is really going on, but you just have to stay with it until the end to find out what it is all about.What really surprised me was the end to this movie, and also the many negative reviews that this DVD got.

For one, there is way too much emphasis on the text scenes. Do we really need to see and hear EVERY single word of dialogue in chat? Such as ""Hi, how are you?"" ""Good and you?"" etc.  They could have easily cut out about fifteen minutes of the film wasted on this. Halle Berry, although a fine actress, seems one-dimensional and ineffective in her role as a reporter; rather than using emotion to act, she uses four letter words instead.Still, with its flaws rampant, I have to admit that this movie did seem mildly interesting until the logic-defying ending of the movie the last ten minutes, where everything is explained verbatim by one of the characters just to make sure we didn't miss any part of the explanation, exactly what everything the first hour and a half meant. (I had to roll my eyes as it all unfolded before me.) After we find this out, we realize that the last ten minutes of the film had nothing to do with the previous hour and a half we spent watching the film, and in fact, it had nothing much to do with the premise or plot of the story we were watching. The bottom line is that every character motive is illogical and a lie. Based on the information at the ending, there is no reason the characters should have acted this way throughout the movie.

1083229,AZAEJB1ECT9HC,B000RO9Q7W,Gary P. Cohen,"[1, 3]","This film opens in an interesting manner.  Halle Berry is a reporter going to interview a U.S. Senator.  We see on his door that he is a Republican from New York.  Being from New York, I wondered about this.  This is so Democrat a state that we cannot even find a decent Republican to run against a loathesome sleazebag like Chuck Schumer.  So why was this character a Republican?  We find out soon enough that he is an in the closet gay pedophile. Now it made sense to me.In the next scene, Halle is in her editor's office and there is an actual framed NY Daily News front page from 1975 (I believe) ""Ford to City: Drop Dead.""  This was when New York was going bankrupt in the early '70s and President Ford and the Federal Government refused to bail us out.  So we have 2 blatant slams against Republicans in the first 2 scenes in this picture.  And you know what?  They have absolutely nothing to do with the film itself.Halle plays a reporter probing the murder of her best friend.  She has a nerdy friend doing all the computer research for her.  He obviously is crazy about her but she ignores him sexually and instead screws her stud boyfriend Gary Dourdan (Warrick, late of CSI)  Halle figures that her friend was having an affair with her boss, a  rich advertizing agency owner, Bruce Willis and sets out to entrap him for her murder.Thats about it.  Nothing all that much happens before the somewhat surprizing conclusion.  Berry looks fantastic and may be the only saving grace of his film.  The director obviously agrees since he has at least 4 shots with the camera staring in close on her rear end.  Willis is unbelievingly and annoyingly miscast as her sleazy boss.  He has hair in this film and I'm not sure if his unflattering hairdo is a wig or whats left of his actual hair.The only extra is an unnecessary "" making of"" short wherein all the actors say great things about each other and slobber over what a genius the director James Foley is.Not such a genius since this incredible mediocrity was in and out of theaters in about 2 weeks.Avoid this one like the plague.",1,An Utterly Mediocre Thriller,1303603200,"04 24, 2011",2011,2086,"['film', 'interesting', 'manner', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'reporter', 'going', 'interview', 'U.S', 'Senator', 'see', 'door', 'Republican', 'New', 'York', 'Being', 'New', 'York', 'wondered', 'so', 'Democrat', 'state', 'can', 'not', 'even', 'find', 'decent', 'Republican', 'run', 'loathesome', 'sleazebag', 'Chuck', 'Schumer', 'So', 'why', 'was', 'character', 'Republican', 'find', 'out', 'soon', 'enough', 'closet', 'gay', 'pedophile', 'Now', 'made', 'sense', 'me.In', 'next', 'scene', 'Halle', 'editor', 'office', 'actual', 'framed', 'NY', 'Daily', 'News', 'front', 'page', '1975', 'believe', 'Ford', 'City', 'Drop', 'Dead', 'was', 'when', 'New', 'York', 'was', 'going', 'bankrupt', 'early', ""'70s"", 'President', 'Ford', 'Federal', 'Government', 'refused', 'bail', 'out', 'have', '2', 'blatant', 'slams', 'Republicans', 'first', '2', 'scenes', 'picture', 'know', 'what', 'have', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'do', 'film', 'itself.Halle', 'reporter', 'probing', 'murder', 'best', 'friend', 'nerdy', 'friend', 'doing', 'computer', 'research', 'obviously', 'crazy', 'sexually', 'instead', 'screws', 'stud', 'boyfriend', 'Gary', 'Dourdan', 'Warrick', 'late', 'CSI', 'Halle', 'friend', 'was', 'having', 'affair', 'boss', 'rich', 'advertizing', 'agency', 'owner', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'out', 'entrap', 'murder.Thats', 'Nothing', 'that', 'much', 'somewhat', 'surprizing', 'conclusion', 'Berry', 'fantastic', 'may', 'be', 'only', 'saving', 'grace', 'film', 'director', 'obviously', 'least', '4', 'shots', 'camera', 'staring', 'close', 'rear', 'end', 'Willis', 'unbelievingly', 'annoyingly', 'miscast', 'sleazy', 'boss', 'hair', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'unflattering', 'hairdo', 'wig', 'whats', 'left', 'actual', 'hair.The', 'only', 'extra', 'unnecessary', 'making', 'short', 'wherein', 'actors', 'say', 'great', 'things', 'other', 'slobber', 'over', 'what', 'genius', 'director', 'James', 'Foley', 'is.Not', 'genius', 'incredible', 'mediocrity', 'was', 'theaters', 'about', '2', 'weeks.Avoid', 'one', 'plague']",N/A

The movie seems to be a vehicle for the beautiful Halle Berry to show off her skills and other assets: Bruce Willis is billed as a co-star but his role is minor and unexpectedly underplayed - a nice little tour de force for the king of action flicks.Berry plays a reporter with a man's nom de plume that allows her to uncover secrets of famous people for newsy stories.  Once fired from her job for uncovering the deeds of a Senator who is promoted by her newspaper, she teams her good buddy Giovanni Ribisi, a wizard of information about the media and internet spying, and the two go after a wealthy ad executive (Bruce Willis) when the murder of one of Berry's old girlfriends stirs both her wrath and her own secret demons.  The chase is on with Berry playing games of deceit backed by the skills of Ribisi. And just when the plot seems to have uncovered the murderer, then another line of story involving Ribisi and Berry explodes the audience's tracking of the crime with a rather good ending.Berry is fine in her role as is Ribisi with his: Willis is not on the screen long enough to form an opinion, a fact that is actually rather a refreshing twist!  The camera loves Berry in all her glamour and manages to turn sordid when the plot elements necessitate that.  It is  a fair evening's diversion and were it not for all the 'dropped ideas' that plead development, it would be a stronger thriller.

1083239,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B000RO9Q7W,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[5, 7]","I gave this movie a chance and it wasn't working for me. Of course we have Halle, who plays Rowena, a crusading reporter for a great metropolitan newspaper, who finds herself swept up in a bizarre chain of events when a friend of hers, Grace (Nicki Aycox) is killed under mysterious circumstances. Just before her death, Grace had given Rowena documentation linking her to a wealthy and powerful ad exec, Harrison Hill, played by Bruce Willis. Does Rowena share any of this information with the police? Of course not, because obstruction of justice is much more fun. Instead, she and her friend-Giovanni Ribisi constructs a plan on Hill.Early on in this movie, it feels as if a reel or two has gone missing, as characters amble in and out of the story with no apparent reason for being there or real connection to anything. If you've ever overheard two strangers having a lengthy and in-depth conversation about people you don't know, you'll know exactly how the first half of this movie feels. Character? Not really. These people are mere constructs, brought on stage for a bit of exposition every now and again when the director wants to sledgehammer a little more ""plot"" into this picture.The rest of the film proceeds along similar lines, with things happening because the writers and director say they should happens, rather than one event organically and logically growing from events that precede it. The so-called ""evidence"" that Rowena gathers against Hill wouldn't even win her a game of Clue, much less actually result in an arrest and a conviction. There's as much tension as you're likely to get in a 15 film, and the ending, while straining cinematic elastic, isn't totally far-fetched, and could even explain Berry's performance.Sadly, the performances in Perfect Stranger are no better than the script. Halle Berry is probably bringing her ""A"" game to this production. Unfortunately, that's the same ""A"" game she's brought to most of her pictures, including the regrettableCatwoman (Widescreen Edition). Bruce Willis, who was fabulous in the first fewDie Hard Collection (Die Hard / Die Hard 2 - Die Harder / Die Hard with a Vengeance / Live Free or Die Hard - Bonus Disc)movies along with a couple of drama hits, is obviously just doing this one for the paycheck, as he doesn't even try to hide the fact that he's phoning it in. His attempts to seduce Rowena are just cold and creepy, rather than sexy and charismatic, with none of the charm he's shown in past roles. Gionvanni Ribisi, wonderful as Dex inSky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (Widescreen Special Collector's Edition), seems almost embarrassed to be a part of this production, as he takes refuge in the drunken, alcoholic aspects of his character more and more as the movie progresses.

Since Bruce was in it though I had to see it because I consider him to be the preeminent actor of this generation.Bruce Willis was (as usual) exceptional in this movie because he was believable and captured and conveyed the type of rage, aggression and dominance that the role demanded. I think his powers were under used though. Perhaps because ""Die Hard with a Vengeance"" came out only a month later he wasn't able to offer a lot of participation, so he basically gives a glorified supporting role. But every scene with him is like magic because he is such a professional. Watching Bruce work with the others in ""Perfect Stranger"" is like watching a master runner outrace his entire competition; no one can keep up with the man.Giovanni Ribisi was very fine in this movie because he was the most multi-faceted. His character was the most in-depth; he ran the gamut of both patsy and weirdo simultaneously. He was pretty hot, too. And there was even one scene when he had his shirt off that he looked exceptionally hot in.I've only seen 1 or 2 movies with Halle Berry and don't care for her one way or the other. She wasn't bad in ""Perfect Stranger."" Perhaps a little subdued at times because it appeared that she was just going through the motions (this is especially evident during the last several scenes).The ending wasn't bad. Perhaps a little overdone and somewhat anticlimactic because it just seemed like the premise, plot and purpse of the entire movie kept changing and there was very little info leading up to anything to form that ""aha moment.""Overall, if you like mystery, suspense and big-budget moving pictures that get their titles from '80s sitcoms about eccentric Myposians you may appreciate ""Perfect Stranger.""",3,the uninvited,1284768000,"09 18, 2010",2010,1804,"['Perfect', 'Stranger', 'not', 'type', 'movie', 'would', 'normally', 'watch', 'Bruce', 'was', 'had', 'see', 'consider', 'be', 'preeminent', 'actor', 'generation.Bruce', 'Willis', 'was', 'usual', 'exceptional', 'movie', 'was', 'believable', 'captured', 'conveyed', 'type', 'rage', 'aggression', 'dominance', 'role', 'demanded', 'think', 'powers', 'were', 'used', 'Perhaps', 'Die', 'Hard', 'Vengeance', 'came', 'out', 'only', 'month', 'later', 'was', ""n't"", 'able', 'offer', 'lot', 'participation', 'basically', 'glorified', 'supporting', 'role', 'scene', 'magic', 'such', 'professional', 'Watching', 'Bruce', 'work', 'others', 'Perfect', 'Stranger', 'watching', 'master', 'runner', 'entire', 'competition', 'one', 'can', 'keep', 'up', 'man.Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'was', 'very', 'fine', 'movie', 'was', 'most', 'multi-faceted', 'character', 'was', 'most', 'in-depth', 'ran', 'gamut', 'patsy', 'weirdo', 'simultaneously', 'was', 'pretty', 'hot', 'too', 'was', 'even', 'one', 'scene', 'when', 'had', 'shirt', 'looked', 'exceptionally', 'hot', 'in.I', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', '1', '2', 'movies', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'Perfect', 'Stranger', 'Perhaps', 'little', 'subdued', 'times', 'appeared', 'was', 'just', 'going', 'motions', 'especially', 'evident', 'last', 'several', 'scenes', '.The', 'ending', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'Perhaps', 'little', 'overdone', 'somewhat', 'anticlimactic', 'just', 'seemed', 'premise', 'plot', 'purpse', 'entire', 'movie', 'kept', 'changing', 'was', 'very', 'little', 'info', 'leading', 'up', 'anything', 'form', 'aha', 'moment', 'Overall', 'like', 'mystery', 'suspense', 'big-budget', 'moving', 'pictures', 'get', 'titles', ""'80s"", 'sitcoms', 'eccentric', 'Myposians', 'may', 'appreciate', 'Perfect', 'Stranger']",N/A

We believe this turkey is a strong candidate for the Razzie Awards. The abomination called Perfect Stranger starring no less than academy award winner Halle Berry and super star Bruce Willis. Despite Berry's looks, the film takes you to a long path of pain and suffering. Don't say we didn't warn you. It is a ""perfect"" mess.Brief Story Intro:Rowena (Halle Berry) is a sexy New York City reporter who is always looking for the truth, and apparently has an agenda. She fights to bring down corrupted rich and powerful white men--especially if they are republicans, which is very clich&eacute;. She is successful with the help of her sidekick, the annoying computer nerd Miles (Giovanni Ribisi) who has a big crush on her. Who wouldn't? Together, they are dynamite, but this kind of work is risky and sometimes doesn't go as expected.She gets suspended for few weeks for trying to bring down a gay US Senator--did you guess which political party? After the suspension, a long time friend Grace (Nicki Aycox) goes missing and ultimately found dead--Rowena saw her few days right before her death. Apparently the number one suspect is magnate Harrison Hill (Bruce Willis) who owns one of the biggest advertising companies in New York. He had an affair with her, but she was going to tell his wife. Grace was about to tell the truth. It is up to Rowena to infiltrate his company and find the facts about what happened to her lifelong friend. As the story progresses, we find more ugly truths about these characters and their real motives.Review:This is without a doubt, the worst movie of 2007.

Sometimes the film has a really good cast and no story, sometimes it's the other way around, and then there are those times when nothing in the movie works and it really makes one question the logic in releasing the movie. I for one hadn't seen a movie like that in a little while, that is, until I watched the Halle Berry and Bruce Willis thriller ""Perfect Stranger"".""Perfect Stranger"" is essentially a story of deception and lies, and how nothing is ever what it seems. When a high-profile advertising executive (Bruce Willis) has an affair that appears to end in the woman's murder, her friend Rowena (Halle Berry), who just so happens to conveniently be an investigative reporter, begins looking into the murder. Rowena believes that the ad exec is the most probable perpetrator of the crime, but he keeps himself so well guarded that there's no easy way to get access to him. So, using her good looks, charm, and investigative skills, Rowena hatches a plan to get close to the exec by any means necessary to bring her friend's killer to justice.""Perfect Stranger"" is the kind of movie that seemed to hold a decent amount of promise, and I must admit that from the previews I thought that this would actually be a really solid thriller. But sometimes, much like the basic theme of the movie, appearances can be deceiving, because not only was this movie not all that thrilling, but the story was rather blah. It didn't seem to contain a whole lot of substance, sure there were numerous plot twists that were intended to keep the audience enthralled and guessing as to what would come next, but not much else was going on. As a result, the twists (which were the only parts of the story worth paying attention to) left audiences with a feeling that each one was either a convenient plot device to push things in the right direction, or in the case of the final twist in the movie near the end, just a cheap attempt at surprising the audience with the unexpected, regardless of the fact that it didn't really fit in with the rest of the movie.Though the movie's story was lacking in depth and plausibility, and heavy on coincidence (which isn't always detrimental to a film's success, but it was here), it did boast two very good actors with Bruce Willis ('Die Hard' series) and Halle Berry ('X-Men' trilogy) in the lead roles. Numerous times Bruce Willis has made some not so hot choices in terms of movie roles he's taken, (""The Fifth Element"" is a good example), but he's been on a fairly decent streak lately with hits such as, ""16 Blocks"" and ""Hostage"", so I can cut him some slack. In the case of Halle Berry, she has also been on a decent hit streak of late with the 'X-Men' films and her turn as a Bond girl in ""007: Die Another Day"", but this Oscar winner is also the woman who made the stupid decision to star in the movie ""Catwoman"", so it's hard to say what she was thinking when she took this role. I would like to think that both of these two really solid actors were simply picking up a paycheck with this movie, basically wanting to fill some time in their schedule, and not really paying much attention to the story of the film. Because if these two actually thought that the story for ""Perfect Stranger"" was truly interesting after reading the script, I've really got to question their decision making capabilities, but like I said earlier I already do question Halle's just a little bit for making ""Catwoman"" (I know, I should let it go).What it all boils down to is that ""Perfect Stranger"", though it looked appealing from the trailers, was nothing more than an average movie (maybe a little below average). Featuring numerous convoluted plot twists that were way too convenient and flat-out annoying without adding any interest to the movie, and a rather boring story that failed to take off.""Perfect Stranger"" is rated R for violence, language, and nudity/sexuality.",2,"Do Yourself A Favor, Be A Stranger To This Movie...",1190419200,"09 22, 2007",2007,4029,"['year', ""'re"", 'pretty', 'much', 'guaranteed', 'Hollywood', 'will', 'release', 'least', '1', '2', 'movies', 'make', 'wonder', 'what', 'were', 'thinking', 'Sometimes', 'film', 'really', 'good', 'cast', 'story', 'other', 'way', 'then', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'nothing', 'movie', 'really', 'one', 'question', 'logic', 'releasing', 'movie', 'one', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'little', 'while', 'watched', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'thriller', 'Perfect', 'Stranger', 'Perfect', 'Stranger', 'essentially', 'story', 'deception', 'lies', 'how', 'nothing', 'ever', 'what', 'When', 'high-profile', 'advertising', 'executive', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'affair', 'end', 'woman', 'murder', 'friend', 'Rowena', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'who', 'just', 'so', 'conveniently', 'be', 'investigative', 'reporter', 'looking', 'murder', 'Rowena', 'ad', 'exec', 'most', 'probable', 'perpetrator', 'crime', 'so', 'well', 'guarded', 'easy', 'way', 'get', 'access', 'So', 'using', 'good', 'looks', 'charm', 'investigative', 'skills', 'Rowena', 'plan', 'get', 'close', 'exec', 'means', 'necessary', 'bring', 'friend', 'killer', 'justice', 'Perfect', 'Stranger', 'kind', 'movie', 'seemed', 'hold', 'decent', 'amount', 'promise', 'must', 'admit', 'previews', 'thought', 'would', 'actually', 'be', 'really', 'solid', 'thriller', 'sometimes', 'much', 'basic', 'theme', 'movie', 'appearances', 'can', 'be', 'deceiving', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'movie', 'not', 'thrilling', 'story', 'was', 'rather', 'blah', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'contain', 'whole', 'lot', 'substance', 'sure', 'were', 'numerous', 'plot', 'twists', 'were', 'intended', 'keep', 'audience', 'enthralled', 'guessing', 'what', 'would', 'come', 'next', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'was', 'going', 'result', 'twists', 'were', 'only', 'parts', 'story', 'paying', 'attention', 'left', 'audiences', 'feeling', 'one', 'was', 'convenient', 'plot', 'device', 'push', 'things', 'right', 'direction', 'case', 'final', 'twist', 'movie', 'end', 'just', 'cheap', 'attempt', 'surprising', 'audience', 'unexpected', 'regardless', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'fit', 'rest', 'movie.Though', 'movie', 'story', 'was', 'lacking', 'depth', 'plausibility', 'heavy', 'coincidence', ""n't"", 'always', 'detrimental', 'film', 'success', 'was', 'here', 'did', 'boast', 'two', 'very', 'good', 'actors', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Hard', 'series', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'X-Men', 'trilogy', 'lead', 'roles', 'Numerous', 'times', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'made', 'not', 'so', 'hot', 'choices', 'terms', 'movie', 'roles', 'taken', 'Fifth', 'Element', 'good', 'example', 'been', 'fairly', 'decent', 'streak', 'lately', 'hits', 'such', '16', 'Blocks', 'Hostage', 'can', 'cut', 'slack', 'case', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'also', 'been', 'decent', 'hit', 'streak', 'late', 'X-Men', 'films', 'turn', 'Bond', 'girl', '007', 'Die', 'Day', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'also', 'woman', 'who', 'made', 'stupid', 'decision', 'star', 'movie', 'Catwoman', 'hard', 'say', 'what', 'was', 'thinking', 'when', 'took', 'role', 'would', 'like', 'think', 'two', 'really', 'solid', 'actors', 'were', 'simply', 'picking', 'up', 'paycheck', 'movie', 'basically', 'wanting', 'fill', 'time', 'schedule', 'not', 'really', 'paying', 'much', 'attention', 'story', 'film', 'two', 'actually', 'thought', 'story', 'Perfect', 'Stranger', 'was', 'truly', 'interesting', 'reading', 'script', ""'ve"", 'really', 'got', 'question', 'decision', 'making', 'capabilities', 'said', 'earlier', 'already', 'do', 'question', 'Halle', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'making', 'Catwoman', 'know', 'should', 'let', 'go', 'down', 'Perfect', 'Stranger', 'looked', 'appealing', 'trailers', 'was', 'nothing', 'more', 'average', 'movie', 'maybe', 'little', 'below', 'average', 'Featuring', 'numerous', 'convoluted', 'plot', 'twists', 'were', 'way', 'too', 'convenient', 'flat-out', 'annoying', 'adding', 'interest', 'movie', 'rather', 'boring', 'story', 'failed', 'take', 'off', 'Perfect', 'Stranger', 'rated', 'R', 'violence', 'language', 'nudity/sexuality']",N/A

1083247,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B000RO9Q7W,Kevin Killian,"[0, 0]","My wife and I enjoyed this movie because finally, a movie comes along that lets Halle Berry do the thing that she does best, ie, wear beautiful clothes in every scene.She has never looked more beautiful and the designers gave her the real million dollar setup.  Playing a reporter, Berry acts all professional for the first five minutes of the movie, where her careful investigative skills catapult a US Senator into admitting on camera that he had slept with his teen interns.  Next thing you know, powerful higherups order the story squelched, considerably cutting into Berry's barroom celebration with her assistant, Giovanni Ribisi.  Is it me or when you see the two words ""Giovannu Ribisi"" on the screen you know you're going to be sitting through some kinky setups?  He's pretty upfront that he has a crush on ""Ro,"" that's not it, it's just him and his constantly moving eyes and the way he keeps licking his lips and adjusting himself inside his pants.OK, so as the plot turns out, Halle Berry is playing a woman with four different identities.  First she's herself, hotshot reporter Rowena Price, only for professional reasons she writes under a man's name, David Shade (or something like that).  Then for further professional reasons she goes undercover as ""Catherine Pogue"" and lands a job at a top advertising agency H2A, while establishing yet a fourth identity as a former staffer at H2A, Veronica, for when she chats online with the Bruce Willis character.  Berry's ingenious acting smooths out the wrinkles in my brain concerning these twists and turns while the movie is actually on the screen, but when I'm walking away I ask myself, ""Why did she have to pretend to be a man to write for the paper?  What was the point of that in the plot?""As every reviewer has pointed out, the movie asks you to make one giant leap of faith (as well as fifty or sixty minor ones).  What was the reason that the enormous frameup had to be engineered?  Why didn't the killer just let sleeping dogs lie after the initial murder was accepted a a suicide or whatever?  I don't want to ring any spoilers but you know going in, it's going to be one of those movies in which every last permutation of your sanity is going to be tested.

1083248,A22TZUXUKA11SQ,B000RO9Q7W,"K. Hinton ""avid reader""","[37, 48]","In the movie Perfect Stranger Halle Berry plays Rowena, a journalist dedicated to uncovering greed and corruption among people in positions of power (read: rich, white men) with the help of her tech-savvy partner in crime, Miles (Giovanni Ribisi). She writes under the name of David Shane, perhaps in an effort to give her stories more clout among those she seeks to bring to justice. Rowena is partying in a bar with Miles, celebrating the success of her latest story, a senator who has a penchant for sleeping with his male interns, when her boss comes in to tell her that the story is being shut down by the bigwigs at her paper. Rowena quits her job in a huff and runs out of the bar, only to be followed by a friend from her past, Grace.Grace seems to know all about Rowena's secret identity as David Shane, and hands Rowena a story that will help her rebuild her career and show the men at her paper that she really is a great journalist. Grace is involved with Harrison Hill (Bruce Willis), the owner of the largest advertising agency in New York, H2A. Grace met Hill in an Internet chat room and became sexually involved with him. Hill, a married man, breaks off their affair in due time, but Grace refuses to go away quietly. She wants Hill exposed as a cheater and a liar and she wants Rowena to do the exposing. Rowena takes Grace's evidence, but doesn't agree to do the story. When Grace turns up dead a week later, Rowena finally decides to investigate. She infiltrates H2A, with Miles's help, and poses as a temp to get closer to Hill. She wants to find out if he's the man behind Grace's death, but she doesn't suspect she might begin to fall for him in the interim...Coming from a person who likes bad movies and revels in the trash that Oscar winners go on to star in (eg, Catwoman, Aeon Flux), Perfect Stranger is virtually unwatchable. For starters, there's the director's penchant for extreme close-ups. And I mean extreme. At one point, I could see the inside of Bruce Willis's nostrils. Then, there's the newsboy cap that Halle Berry runs around in for most of the film, which I guess is meant to convince us that she's really a journalist. Also, we have Berry's gratuitous sex scenes with the hottie from CSI, which in no way add to the plot or continuity of the movie, but I guess if men don't get to hear Halle Berry talking dirty they won't feel they've gotten their money's worth. And let me not forget the fact that Halle Berry takes on a distinct lisp when she says the F-word (seriously, every single time it sounds like she might spit on someone), and she says it quite a few times over the course of the film. Finally, there was the end-of-the-movie voice-over wrap up, which I just cannot tolerate. You know what I mean (think Wild Things), when the movie's ending doesn't make any sense so instead a voice-over tells you all the clues you were supposed to have seen but didn't, so that the real story can be uncovered. It's a cop out and sloppy story-telling, and put the finishing touches on an already crappy film.There were 100 other things wrong with this movie that I might have been able to forgive if it had aired on Lifetime instead of in a movie theater. I laughed out loud more times than I can count, and this movie is billed as a ""psychological thriller,"" not a comedy. Take my advice and rent Wild Things or Gothika or heck, even Glitter, and you'll be guaranteed to have a better time than wasting $8 to see this drivel.",1,"So bad, I'd recommend Glitter before this trash",1176595200,"04 15, 2007",2007,3468,"['movie', 'Perfect', 'Stranger', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'Rowena', 'journalist', 'dedicated', 'uncovering', 'greed', 'corruption', 'people', 'positions', 'power', 'read', 'rich', 'white', 'men', 'help', 'tech-savvy', 'partner', 'crime', 'Miles', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'name', 'David', 'Shane', 'perhaps', 'effort', 'give', 'stories', 'more', 'clout', 'bring', 'justice', 'Rowena', 'partying', 'bar', 'Miles', 'celebrating', 'success', 'latest', 'story', 'senator', 'who', 'penchant', 'sleeping', 'male', 'interns', 'when', 'boss', 'tell', 'story', 'being', 'shut', 'down', 'bigwigs', 'paper', 'Rowena', 'job', 'huff', 'bar', 'only', 'be', 'followed', 'friend', 'past', 'Grace.Grace', 'know', 'Rowena', 'secret', 'identity', 'David', 'Shane', 'Rowena', 'story', 'will', 'help', 'rebuild', 'career', 'show', 'men', 'paper', 'really', 'great', 'journalist', 'Grace', 'involved', 'Harrison', 'Hill', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'owner', 'largest', 'advertising', 'agency', 'New', 'York', 'H2A', 'Grace', 'met', 'Hill', 'Internet', 'chat', 'room', 'became', 'sexually', 'involved', 'Hill', 'married', 'man', 'breaks', 'off', 'affair', 'due', 'time', 'Grace', 'go', 'away', 'quietly', 'Hill', 'exposed', 'cheater', 'liar', 'Rowena', 'do', 'exposing', 'Rowena', 'Grace', 'evidence', ""n't"", 'agree', 'do', 'story', 'When', 'Grace', 'up', 'dead', 'week', 'later', 'Rowena', 'finally', 'investigate', 'H2A', 'Miles', 'help', 'temp', 'get', 'closer', 'Hill', 'find', 'out', 'man', 'Grace', 'death', ""n't"", 'suspect', 'might', 'begin', 'fall', 'interim', 'Coming', 'person', 'who', 'bad', 'movies', 'revels', 'trash', 'Oscar', 'winners', 'go', 'star', 'eg', 'Catwoman', 'Aeon', 'Flux', 'Perfect', 'Stranger', 'virtually', 'unwatchable', 'starters', 'director', 'penchant', 'extreme', 'close-ups', 'mean', 'extreme', 'one', 'point', 'could', 'see', 'inside', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'nostrils', 'Then', 'newsboy', 'cap', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'around', 'most', 'film', 'guess', 'meant', 'convince', 'really', 'journalist', 'Also', 'have', 'Berry', 'gratuitous', 'sex', 'scenes', 'hottie', 'CSI', 'way', 'plot', 'continuity', 'movie', 'guess', 'men', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'hear', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'talking', 'dirty', 'wo', ""n't"", 'feel', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'money', 'worth', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'fact', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'distinct', 'lisp', 'when', 'F-word', 'seriously', 'single', 'time', 'might', 'spit', 'someone', 'few', 'times', 'course', 'film', 'Finally', 'was', 'end-of-the-movie', 'voice-over', 'wrap', 'up', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'tolerate', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'think', 'Wild', 'Things', 'when', 'movie', 'ending', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'so', 'instead', 'voice-over', 'tells', 'clues', 'were', 'supposed', 'have', 'seen', 'did', ""n't"", 'real', 'story', 'can', 'be', 'uncovered', 'cop', 'sloppy', 'story-telling', 'put', 'finishing', 'touches', 'already', 'crappy', 'film.There', 'were', '100', 'other', 'things', 'wrong', 'movie', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'forgive', 'had', 'aired', 'Lifetime', 'instead', 'movie', 'theater', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'more', 'times', 'can', 'count', 'movie', 'billed', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'not', 'comedy', 'Take', 'advice', 'rent', 'Wild', 'Things', 'Gothika', 'heck', 'even', 'Glitter', ""'ll"", 'be', 'guaranteed', 'have', 'better', 'time', 'wasting', '8', 'see', 'drivel']",N/A

Frankly, it's the kind of movie in a couple years you'll remember seeing it, but you'll find it very hard to remember what happened. Halle Berry wasted her talent, Giovanni Ribisi..same thing, Bruce Willis..ditto! With actors like this in this movie there is no way it should've been this disappointing. I guess the ending had a nice little twist, but nothing I can really say that shocked or impressed me. It just shows that once again ""There is no such thing as a perfect murder"". In a way, it was kind of predicatable because as we all learned in basic ""thriller movie"" 101 that the killer is not always the most likely person. So, going into this the viewers already know that whomever most of the evidence points to is most likely NOT! the killer. I think Halle Berry tried to do something different this time around, and it just didn't work. Whereas, in my opinion, Gothika, was different from her normal roles, but at least I thought it was good. I'm sorry, but this movie is like lukewarm water, and at some point your waiting for it to start boiling, but it never does, it remains flat and insipid.

This film was one I pulled from the video store because I hadn't seen it.  The big problem with the film is that there really isn't anyone to root for, no one with which the audience can identify.  The closest is Miles Haley, played by Giovanni Ribisi.  Ribisi is a talented character actor with power and emotional range.  His computer whizz character is somewhat charming and suffering from the unrequited love of Rowena Price; but his secret bedroom is too much information and his constant crossing of boundaries makes it impossible to really cheer for him.  Halle Berry plays the lead Rowena.  She is driven, uses her beauty as a tool, but seems unable to be nice to anyone.  One minute she turns on her boyfriend Cameron played by CSI's Gary Dourdan, then snaps at Miles who is helping her then is nasty to Bruce Willis.  Willis' character is Harrison Hill, a wealthy advertising tycoon who is a womanizer.  Other than hormonal romance, he is not a very nice guy, although he does talk about loyalty a lot, even as he cheats on his wife.  Nicki Aycox has a nice supporting role as Grace whose murder is the story's focal point and keeps reappearing in flashback.  Elizabeth Clayton, her mother, is played by the great actress Kathleen Chalfant in an emotional cameo.  While the intrigue of the story is well directed, it is the lack of a character to like that makes the story be one about which we cannot ultimately care.

Although the film seems a tad slow at times, it never made me feel like it was losing direction, and kept throwing enough suspenseful scenes and questionable possibilities at me that I was never bored with its overall style.Bruce Willis fans may be disappointed for the simple fact his character is not really a main focus in the film, but you better believe that the mere presence of this actor adds a lot to the character he plays.  The film starts picking up steam when Berry's character (Rowena) finds herself running into some deadly secrets that could mean trouble for her if they are let out into the open.  Rabisi's character (Miles) is a tech savvy friend who helps her out in many ways, but has some mysterious things going on in his own present day world.  Overall I really just liked the characters and especially enjoyed how well written this script was, it had a good depth within the back stories of the main characters and answered many questions at the end, although you may not like the way some answers come down the pipe!",4,"Secrets that grow, both offline...and on",1187827200,"08 23, 2007",2007,1618,"['Perfect', 'Stranger', 'very', 'interesting', 'film', 'few', 'different', 'topics', 'one', 'being', 'aura', 'anonymous', 'online', 'communication', 'other', 'main', 'topic', 'would', 'be', 'damage', 'person', 'psyche', 'childhood', 'experience', 'seen', 'main', 'character', 'movie', 'played', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'also', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi.From', 'previews', 'film', 'going', 'have', 'pretty', 'basic', 'plot', 'fortunately', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'more', 'things', 'going', 'terms', 'twists', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'especially', 'end', 'film', 'tad', 'slow', 'times', 'never', 'made', 'feel', 'was', 'losing', 'direction', 'kept', 'throwing', 'enough', 'suspenseful', 'scenes', 'questionable', 'possibilities', 'was', 'never', 'bored', 'overall', 'style.Bruce', 'Willis', 'fans', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed', 'simple', 'fact', 'character', 'not', 'really', 'main', 'focus', 'film', 'better', 'believe', 'mere', 'presence', 'actor', 'lot', 'character', 'film', 'picking', 'up', 'steam', 'when', 'Berry', 'character', 'Rowena', 'herself', 'running', 'deadly', 'secrets', 'could', 'mean', 'trouble', 'are', 'let', 'out', 'open', 'Rabisi', 'character', 'Miles', 'tech', 'savvy', 'friend', 'who', 'out', 'many', 'ways', 'mysterious', 'things', 'going', 'own', 'present', 'day', 'world', 'Overall', 'really', 'just', 'liked', 'characters', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'how', 'well', 'written', 'script', 'was', 'had', 'good', 'depth', 'back', 'stories', 'main', 'characters', 'answered', 'many', 'questions', 'end', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'way', 'answers', 'come', 'down', 'pipe']",N/A

As it is, it is a tired mess that harks back to far superior similar `thrillers' from the `90's.Halle Berry has a friend who is killed in an unusual way, just after confiding to Berry she was meeting and potentially blackmailing Bruce Willis, a married high flying executive with an eye for the ladies.Halle Berry, being an investigative journalist, pulls in her friend Giovanni Ribisi ( the best thing in the movie, and the only true acting with any ambiguity attached) to go under cover.  Or under the covers, might be more appropriate.  She poses online to meet him in his preferred chatroom, and as a temp in his office seducing him to get close enough to find out what she needs to know.Needless to say, twists and turns follow.  Let's just say right off - watching people type instant messages to each other is NOT exciting.  And if you are expecting some frisson of sexual tension or action on screen, you are also likely to be hugely disappointed.  Although advertised as an erotic thriller, the action is all of the internet kind and any supposed tension in the story is of the whodunit variety rather than whodunwho... and it's a good thing Willis and Berry don't get down and dirty, with the appalling lack of chemistry they appear to have, and lack of conviction in their roles they exude.Ribisi is the only successful wild card in the proceedings that leaves us in any doubt as to the outcome.  That ending may be a supposed twist, but lacks the credibility to be satisfying, as the facts all jump out at the end like a cheap trick in a funhouse, rather than thought provoking moment that puts pieces together strewn through the movie, in the way a better scripted effort might have achieved.Disappointing, with suitably flimsy `making of..' as the sole extra.

I thought that putting Halle and Bruce together would be actually a great idea since they appeared to actually look good side-by-side.I was totally wrong. I still think Halle and Bruce could have made this a great movie together if only the story they had to play along with was any good. It does again sound promising but the plot does fall apart in good time and quite terribly may I add. Not to mention Bruce isn't truly the center of the movie like they tried to make it as- matter of fact there is so little of Bruce that he ends up being just a weak and very boring character. It's more Halle and her creepy friend that helps her throughout that is given the most time together- and they are a weak combination. I wanted more of Halle with Bruce with a lot stronger dialogue together than they had so maybe they could put some life into Bruce's character. Didn't happen though which really killed the movie in my opinion.So yes it was a complete disappointment of a film.

""Perfect Stranger"" is just the latest in a long line of inferior films in which the actress has appeared since winning the Oscar a few years back for ""Monster's Ball.""Berry plays Rowena Price, an investigative reporter who goes undercover as a temp at an ad agency after a childhood friend of hers turns up dead in the Hudson River.  It appears that the friend had just broken up with the married CEO of the company (Bruce Willis) and was on the verge of exposing his wrongdoing to the public.""Perfect Stranger"" is an unimaginative, plodding thriller that believes it can redeem itself in its closing stages with one of those ""surprise"" - but actually utterly implausible - whipsaw endings that have become all the rage these days.  It doesn't work - and, in fact, all we feel is resentful, manhandled and cheated because we sense that the filmmakers have not been playing fair with us or abiding by the very same rules of logic that they themselves have laid down for us to follow.Berry may be one of the great beauties of modern cinema, but her acting, in this movie at least, leaves much to be desired.  Her shallow reactions and atonal reading of lines suggest that she needs to either hit some serious acting classes again or, at the very least, find roles that will challenge her to go beyond the surface in her performances.  Willis is his usual sturdy self, though the screenplay doesn't really give him all that much to do, while Giovanni Ribisi, as Rowena's fellow reporter, gets to perform most of the heavy lifting in the acting department.""Perfect Stranger"" is yet another disposable and instantly forgettable addition to the increasingly unimpressive oeuvre of Miss Halle Berry.",2,"""Imperfect"" would be more like it",1197763200,"12 16, 2007",2007,1803,"['point', 'career', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'should', 'probably', 'give', 'serious', 'consideration', 'firing', 'agent', 'Perfect', 'Stranger', 'just', 'latest', 'long', 'line', 'inferior', 'films', 'actress', 'appeared', 'winning', 'Oscar', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'Monster', 'Ball', 'Berry', 'Rowena', 'Price', 'investigative', 'reporter', 'who', 'undercover', 'temp', 'ad', 'agency', 'childhood', 'friend', 'hers', 'up', 'dead', 'Hudson', 'River', 'friend', 'had', 'just', 'broken', 'up', 'married', 'CEO', 'company', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'was', 'verge', 'exposing', 'wrongdoing', 'public', 'Perfect', 'Stranger', 'unimaginative', 'plodding', 'thriller', 'can', 'redeem', 'closing', 'stages', 'one', 'surprise', 'actually', 'utterly', 'implausible', 'whipsaw', 'endings', 'have', 'become', 'rage', 'days', ""n't"", 'work', 'fact', 'feel', 'resentful', 'manhandled', 'cheated', 'sense', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'playing', 'fair', 'abiding', 'very', 'same', 'rules', 'logic', 'have', 'laid', 'down', 'follow.Berry', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'great', 'beauties', 'modern', 'cinema', 'acting', 'movie', 'least', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'shallow', 'reactions', 'atonal', 'reading', 'lines', 'suggest', 'hit', 'serious', 'acting', 'classes', 'again', 'very', 'least', 'find', 'roles', 'will', 'challenge', 'go', 'surface', 'performances', 'Willis', 'usual', 'sturdy', 'self', 'screenplay', ""n't"", 'really', 'give', 'that', 'much', 'do', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'Rowena', 'fellow', 'reporter', 'perform', 'most', 'heavy', 'lifting', 'acting', 'department', 'Perfect', 'Stranger', 'yet', 'disposable', 'instantly', 'forgettable', 'addition', 'increasingly', 'unimpressive', 'oeuvre', 'Miss', 'Halle', 'Berry']",N/A

I was so disappointed by this movie that it is not even funny. The first thing that struck me was how bad the dialogues were. It is hard to believe somebody actually took the time to write these lines without trying to make them seem illogical on purpose. And talking about illogical, what about the ending? The final twist comes so far out from left field that I thought it was a joke, and even worse, it really makes little sense with the rest of the plot.I have a hard time believing that the Halle Berry I saw in this film is the same actress that won an Oscar a couple of years ago. Her performance was disastrous, and the way in which she delivered her lines was completely wooden. Maybe she had a hard time dealing with the outright bad script, but that cannot be an excuse. Especially because when you look at Bruce Willis and even Giovanni Ribisi, you see that these two actors overcame the low quality plot and delivered performances that at least were good enough to be believable.The story starts out as a good idea; a reporter (Berry) is trying to prove that ad mogul Harrison Hill (Willis) is the culprit in the murder of her childhood friend.

But there were too many inconsistent results. Without giving away the movie, one cannot kill someone with the weapon used into their back and then it only shows in the front. Even a half-wit killer would know where to hide a body, so if there was blackmail involved, the person who was blackmailed deserved it for being dumb. When a character finds out such disturbing information (think computer voice) about another person, chances are that they won't be so bold and confrontational after viewing all of this person's secrets. The pharmacy issue was not made very clear until the end. No one has drinks in public places if their wife is such a detective. And what kind of small town do these people live in where the media can hit up big-time people, but you can leave your key on top of a door?

From the horrible screenplay, the terrible acting, inept direction and dull cinematography Perfect Stranger is like a blue print for how not to make a movie. I can only hope every film teacher makes their students watch this just to point out all the rookie mistakes made by the professionals.Halle Berry is Ro, a hard-boiled reporter writing under the pseudonym David Shane. When her story to reveal a closeted senator is scuttled by her editor she quits her job. On her way home, Grace an old childhood friend seems to have a lead on another story Ad mogul Hamilton Hill has been sexually harassing his co-workers.The next day Grace is found dead. Ro seems to be working hard on ferreting out Hamilton Hill as the killer or so it seems. With the help of her Jimmy Olsen type partner Miles she lands a temp job at Ata or wherever Mr. Hill works. She has some online chat with Mr. Hill that is supposed to be steamy and even raunchy. Or so they want us to believe. Red Shoe Diaries this ain&iexcl;t. Most of the stuff they chat about wouldn&iexcl;t raise an eyebrow in a daytime soap.In between flashbacks of alleged molestation, Ro starts getting close to Hamilton, He starts getting close to her, after pretending to hide a note in his office. Shawn has to force his eyelids open to keep watching the movie. They have an encounter in the restaurant followed by a ride in Hamilton&iexcl;s BMW. Hill Fires Ro and she goes to visit her mother. Ro finds out Miles we get a cheesy explanation of Ro&iexcl;s mother committing murder to protect her. Somewhere someone in the editing room realized they were running out of time and the movie goes into overdrive to wrap up the story. Hill is arrested without an explanation and then we get a big voice over and here comes the Big twist-Ro is revealed to be the Grace&iexcl;s REAL killer because her Grace saw her bury her father&iexcl;s body. It&iexcl;s revealed Grace has been blackmailing Ro for years. Ro killed her to avoid going to jail and framed Hamilton Hill for it. Miles finds out about the hot mess and starts demanding favors from Ro. The cycle starts all over again when Ro kills Miles, makes it look like a rape. The movie ends with her her neighbor looking out the window witnessing the murder. Wonder what he&iexcl;s going to ask her for? I know what I want to ask the producers: WHY DID YOU GREENLIGHT THIS CRAP?Man oh man This movie stinks. Like rotting garbage. Like a cesspool. Like Industrial waste. Like-Well you get my drift. Throughout the predictable story there are a ton of unresolved plot threads left hanging like Grace&iexcl;s boyfriend, Hamilton&iexcl;s wife and well, Ro&iexcl;s big-time reporting Job that fell down a plot hole.As writer I haven&iexcl;t seen so many mistakes in a screenplay presented right in front of me. The whole film plays like a first draft that is in desperate need of a rewrite. Awkward dialogue that make no sense, on the nose lines and the clumsiest usage of profanity since Crocodile 2: Death Roll. Except in Crocodile 2: Death Roll the excessive profanity is kind of funny and adds a kind of camp factor to the movie. Here in PS it just comes off as a clumsy excuse to make the characters sound tough. Perfect Stranger is the perfect film for aspiring screenwriters to learn how to NOT write a screenplay.The acting here is flat and one note. Halle Berry  is horrible as Ro. Her performance is flat and one-dimensional; It&iexcl;s one of her worst performances EVER. I keep waiting for her to turn it around. I want to see a movie where she returns to form and acts like the actress who gave great performances in Introducing Dorothy Dandridge and Losing Isaiah. But with each film she finds new ways to disappoint me. She did look good in those clothes though. Bruce Willis is DEAD onscreen here as Hamilton Hill. Having seen what he can do in Sixth sense, this performance is far below an actor of his talents can do. Giovanni Ribisi Gary Dourdan is wasted here as the boyfriend. Nicki Acyox is boring as Grace.

It excels a bit more on the small screen than it did perhaps on the larger one because of its TV-Movie feel.Being a fan of both Berry and Willis must obviously color my perspective of the film, but I still think that it was well-acted, well-paced, and generally well-written although one can start to piece this mystery together before the end of the film (but not too much before the end).  This film has far too many twists and turns for me to adequately review it without giving away key elements in the story and other reviewers on here give away far too much without posting the appropriate ""Spoiler Alert"" at the top of their review.  Simply put, Berry is a journalist who consistently feels put down by controlling men in her life.  When her best friend is murdered, she sets out to work undercover for Bruce Willis who may or may not be the killer.  Giovanni Ribisi is her assistant who assists her with her tech problems, but he does so at a cost to Berry.  While fairly predicatable in multiple places, there are numerous unpredicatable moments with some clever twists to boot.For me, this was a well-crafted ""little"" thriller that admittedly has a TV-movie feel to it much like the old ABC Saturday Night Suspense Movie of the 1970's (where ""Fantasy Island"" got it's start).  Perhaps that is where most were unhappy with this flick in that it isn't that thrilling or graphic by any means.  It's a rather tame R rated film, but deserving of its R stamp nevertheless.  The story is familiar and has admittedly been done better in the past.  Willis has played this quiet but explosive underneath character before and Berry isn't doing any great acting stretch here either, so many may have dismissed this film a bit too off-handedly.  I can understand that, but the film is still enjoyable and the actors are definitely interesting and engaging.  Berry's sidekick, played by the ever watchable Ribisi [sp?], does steal the show a bit from the stars, but that's a positive aspect for the film, not a negative one.This film is definitely worth a renting, but being a Berry/Willis fan I'm off to purchase it.",4,"Not ""Perfect"", but still real good.",1189987200,"09 17, 2007",2007,2150,"['Give', 'little', 'thriller', 'chance', 'bit', 'more', 'small', 'screen', 'did', 'perhaps', 'larger', 'one', 'TV-Movie', 'feel.Being', 'fan', 'Berry', 'Willis', 'must', 'obviously', 'color', 'perspective', 'film', 'still', 'think', 'was', 'well-acted', 'well-paced', 'generally', 'well-written', 'one', 'can', 'start', 'piece', 'mystery', 'together', 'end', 'film', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'end', 'film', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'twists', 'turns', 'adequately', 'review', 'giving', 'away', 'key', 'elements', 'story', 'other', 'reviewers', 'here', 'give', 'away', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'posting', 'appropriate', 'Spoiler', 'Alert', 'top', 'review', 'Simply', 'put', 'Berry', 'journalist', 'who', 'consistently', 'put', 'down', 'controlling', 'men', 'life', 'When', 'best', 'friend', 'murdered', 'out', 'work', 'undercover', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'killer', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'assistant', 'who', 'tech', 'problems', 'so', 'cost', 'Berry', 'fairly', 'predicatable', 'multiple', 'places', 'are', 'numerous', 'unpredicatable', 'moments', 'clever', 'twists', 'boot.For', 'was', 'well-crafted', 'little', 'thriller', 'admittedly', 'TV-movie', 'feel', 'much', 'old', 'ABC', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Suspense', 'Movie', '1970', 'where', 'Fantasy', 'Island', 'got', 'start', 'Perhaps', 'where', 'most', 'were', 'unhappy', 'flick', ""n't"", 'thrilling', 'graphic', 'means', 'rather', 'tame', 'R', 'rated', 'film', 'deserving', 'R', 'stamp', 'nevertheless', 'story', 'familiar', 'admittedly', 'been', 'done', 'better', 'past', 'Willis', 'played', 'quiet', 'explosive', 'underneath', 'character', 'Berry', ""n't"", 'doing', 'great', 'acting', 'stretch', 'here', 'either', 'so', 'many', 'may', 'have', 'dismissed', 'film', 'bit', 'too', 'off-handedly', 'can', 'understand', 'film', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'actors', 'are', 'definitely', 'interesting', 'engaging', 'Berry', 'sidekick', 'played', 'ever', 'watchable', 'Ribisi', '[', 'sp', ']', 'steal', 'show', 'bit', 'stars', 'positive', 'aspect', 'film', 'not', 'negative', 'one.This', 'film', 'definitely', 'worth', 'renting', 'being', 'Berry/Willis', 'fan', ""'m"", 'purchase']",N/A
1083282,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B000RO9Q7W,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[1, 1]","Astonishingly tense and wickedly complex, Perfect Stranger manages to put a new twist on the murder-mystery genre. If you are under the assumption that every whodunit scenario has already been realized, this film shines a new light on previously exploited suspect-to-murder combinations. Superbly acted and stylishly scripted, Perfect Stranger is an engaging thriller guaranteed to keep you guessing until its shocking conclusion.When a close friend of muckraking journalist Rowena Price (Halle Berry) turns up brutally murdered after giving her damaging information about the scandalous affairs of bigwig executive Harrison Hill (Bruce Willis), Price suspects him of the crime and begins a dangerous quest to uncover the truth. With the help of her friend Miles, (Giovanni Ribisi) the cunning reporter becomes a temp for Hill and quickly exposes a web of lies, deceit, and disloyalty that force her into a deadly game of cat-and-mouse that may find her the perfect stranger - and the next victim.In a world where every murder and subsequent mystery seems to have already been exploited, and every scenario already drowned in a sea of endless repetition, it's refreshing to see a film that realizes this and purposely tricks its audience into surmising the incorrect assumptions. Though the basic foundation may be recognizable, the methods for revealing it haven't been seen in quite some time. The recent trend in movies centering on a mystery or an overly complex storyline is to spoon-feed the audience at the end, and while Perfect Stranger is no exception, its use of unpredictable characters and plot twists provide an instance where you won't feel too insulted by the deliberate explanation. The clever script also craftily pulls you in the opposite direction of the truth, only letting you wander back on track for a moment before unveiling a revelation that reveals you couldn't have been further from it. The only real flaw to the presentation of its mystery is the use of several overly ambiguous flashbacks that hint at something diabolical, but never really shows you enough to figure out its intentions. Perhaps its mission is to provide more of a twistedly shocking climax, but leaving the audience in the dark for too long might blind them from the catharsis of the conclusion, and certainly robs them of the hope of deducing the mystery themselves.As most murder mysteries are, Perfect Stranger is a character driven story and this one boasts a talented cast with a unique turn for both leads. Halle Berry provides a compelling performance as the troubled heroine hell-bent on bringing down the man responsible for her friend's death, and reveals a slightly sinister edge to her character that places an interesting spin on how much the audience may be rooting for her success. Bruce Willis lends his charismatic presence as an adulterous advertising executive and gives a convincing performance that complements the mood of the picture; though it's a shame his devious aggression appears somewhat subdued. Giovanni Ribisi steals the show as a nerdish computer tech aiding in Rowena's pursuits who also reveals a darker and more calculating side than one would expect from character who is essentially a sidekick. He also provides the film's only real comedy relief, and a fantastic effort he gives, often causing hysterical laughter with his fiendish antics.Don't be deceived by the lackluster trailer - Perfect Stranger is a taut cat-and-mouse thriller with strong performances, deviously entertaining characters, and enough twists and turns to keep the predictability low and the suspense high. Though not graced with too hard an ""R"" rating, it does support a more chillingly serious tone with conflicted characters whose morals remain a shade darker, and while the outcome may not be overly original, the process in reaching it certainly is. Unless you still haven't forgiven Berry for Catwoman, this Stranger is one worth meeting.- Joel Massie",3,Perfect Stranger Movie Review,1187481600,"08 19, 2007",2007,3966,"['Astonishingly', 'tense', 'wickedly', 'complex', 'Perfect', 'Stranger', 'put', 'new', 'twist', 'murder-mystery', 'genre', 'are', 'assumption', 'whodunit', 'scenario', 'already', 'been', 'realized', 'film', 'new', 'light', 'previously', 'exploited', 'suspect-to-murder', 'combinations', 'Superbly', 'acted', 'stylishly', 'scripted', 'Perfect', 'Stranger', 'engaging', 'thriller', 'guaranteed', 'keep', 'guessing', 'shocking', 'conclusion.When', 'close', 'friend', 'muckraking', 'journalist', 'Rowena', 'Price', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'up', 'brutally', 'murdered', 'giving', 'damaging', 'information', 'scandalous', 'affairs', 'bigwig', 'executive', 'Harrison', 'Hill', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Price', 'crime', 'dangerous', 'quest', 'uncover', 'truth', 'help', 'friend', 'Miles', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'cunning', 'reporter', 'temp', 'Hill', 'quickly', 'web', 'lies', 'deceit', 'disloyalty', 'deadly', 'game', 'cat-and-mouse', 'may', 'find', 'perfect', 'stranger', 'next', 'victim.In', 'world', 'where', 'murder', 'subsequent', 'mystery', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'exploited', 'scenario', 'already', 'drowned', 'sea', 'endless', 'repetition', 'refreshing', 'see', 'film', 'purposely', 'tricks', 'audience', 'surmising', 'incorrect', 'assumptions', 'basic', 'foundation', 'may', 'be', 'recognizable', 'methods', 'revealing', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'seen', 'quite', 'time', 'recent', 'trend', 'movies', 'centering', 'mystery', 'overly', 'complex', 'storyline', 'spoon-feed', 'audience', 'end', 'Perfect', 'Stranger', 'exception', 'use', 'unpredictable', 'characters', 'plot', 'twists', 'provide', 'instance', 'where', 'wo', ""n't"", 'feel', 'too', 'insulted', 'deliberate', 'explanation', 'clever', 'script', 'also', 'craftily', 'opposite', 'direction', 'truth', 'only', 'letting', 'wander', 'back', 'track', 'moment', 'unveiling', 'revelation', 'reveals', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'further', 'only', 'real', 'flaw', 'presentation', 'mystery', 'use', 'several', 'overly', 'ambiguous', 'flashbacks', 'hint', 'something', 'diabolical', 'never', 'really', 'enough', 'figure', 'out', 'intentions', 'Perhaps', 'mission', 'provide', 'more', 'twistedly', 'shocking', 'climax', 'leaving', 'audience', 'dark', 'too', 'long', 'might', 'blind', 'catharsis', 'conclusion', 'certainly', 'robs', 'hope', 'deducing', 'mystery', 'themselves.As', 'most', 'murder', 'mysteries', 'are', 'Perfect', 'Stranger', 'character', 'driven', 'story', 'one', 'talented', 'cast', 'unique', 'turn', 'leads', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'compelling', 'performance', 'troubled', 'heroine', 'hell-bent', 'bringing', 'down', 'man', 'responsible', 'friend', 'death', 'slightly', 'sinister', 'edge', 'character', 'interesting', 'spin', 'how', 'much', 'audience', 'may', 'be', 'rooting', 'success', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'charismatic', 'presence', 'adulterous', 'advertising', 'executive', 'convincing', 'performance', 'mood', 'picture', 'shame', 'devious', 'aggression', 'somewhat', 'subdued', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'show', 'nerdish', 'computer', 'tech', 'aiding', 'Rowena', 'pursuits', 'who', 'also', 'darker', 'more', 'calculating', 'side', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'character', 'who', 'essentially', 'sidekick', 'also', 'film', 'only', 'real', 'comedy', 'relief', 'fantastic', 'effort', 'often', 'causing', 'hysterical', 'laughter', 'fiendish', 'antics.Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'deceived', 'lackluster', 'trailer', 'Perfect', 'Stranger', 'taut', 'cat-and-mouse', 'thriller', 'strong', 'performances', 'deviously', 'entertaining', 'characters', 'enough', 'twists', 'keep', 'predictability', 'low', 'suspense', 'high', 'not', 'graced', 'too', 'hard', 'R', 'rating', 'support', 'more', 'chillingly', 'serious', 'tone', 'conflicted', 'characters', 'morals', 'remain', 'shade', 'darker', 'outcome', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'overly', 'original', 'process', 'reaching', 'certainly', 'still', 'have', ""n't"", 'forgiven', 'Berry', 'Catwoman', 'Stranger', 'one', 'worth', 'meeting.-', 'Joel', 'Massie']",N/A

Yes, she is gorgeous here again, but you know that's not surprising after all.  And don't forget the fashionable costumes of her.But ""Perfect Stranger"" is supposed to be a mystery, which is a sad thing because it is not mysterious at all. You may call it a noir, but noir needs atmosphere and intriguing characters, which ""Perfect Stranger"" doesn't have. There are only three marginally interesting characters here - Rowena Price, an ambitious news reporter played by Halle Berry, Harrison Hill, successful businessman played by Bruce Willis and Miles Haley, a nerdy computer wizard played, not surprisingly, by Giovanni Ribisi.I don't reveal anything about the film's unnecessarily convoluted plot except the first 20 minutes, which is not very good. Rowena suspects a foul play behind the strange death of her old friend and starts her investigation on her own, using an alias. Her biggest problem is how to get an access to the ""suspect""; our biggest problem while watching the film is that her logics are unconvincing in the first place, her methods impossible and results too good to be true. In this film not many characters are careful enough to hide important things in the right place or wise enough to distrust what is written and sent on the internet. By the time I saw the film's ending, I lost interest in what really happened.The biggest surprise for me during the long and twisted course of the story is the scene in which Bruce Willis' character literally hurls an employee across the room in his office in order to fire him.
