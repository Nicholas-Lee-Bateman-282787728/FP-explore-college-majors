Location photography and adept chiarscuro provide a palpable realism as fully fleshed-out characters cross paths through the nocturnal  gloom, in a busy precinct station, cacophonous cabaret, swank evildoers' digs, and cavernous office building.  Several less-developed, but colorful portrayals add to the texture of authenticity as they weave in and out of the action.  The most intriguing of these is a model cum mechanical man who lures the curious to a nightclub.  Whether he is real or not is a knottily noirish question....",4,Chicago After Midnight,1060819200,"08 14, 2003",2003,705,"['Film', 'noir', 'fans', 'will', 'positively', 'delight', 'sophisticated', 'police', 'drama', 'gritty', 'cityscapes', 'glaring', 'depictions', 'graveyard-shift', 'patrolling', 'lurid', 'nightlife', 'Location', 'photography', 'adept', 'chiarscuro', 'provide', 'palpable', 'realism', 'fully', 'fleshed-out', 'characters', 'cross', 'paths', 'nocturnal', 'gloom', 'busy', 'precinct', 'station', 'cacophonous', 'cabaret', 'swank', 'evildoers', 'digs', 'cavernous', 'office', 'building', 'Several', 'less-developed', 'colorful', 'portrayals', 'add', 'texture', 'authenticity', 'weave', 'action', 'most', 'intriguing', 'model', 'cum', 'mechanical', 'man', 'who', 'curious', 'nightclub', 'real', 'not', 'knottily', 'noirish', 'question']",N/A
243758,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,6301039017,David Baldwin,"[2, 3]","The most striking thing in this film is John L. Russell's evocative cinematography of Chicago's cityscape.  This is so overpowering that it threatens to overwhelm character and storytelling.  Your initial reaction here is there are too many characters, too many relationships, interrelationships and the film is overplotted.  There's a point, however, in the film where it achieves equillibrium.  In my opinion that is when we are introduced to a character named Hayes Stewart played by William Talman who would later be better known as Hamilton Burger on the old ""Perry Mason"" TV show.  On the surface Stewart is a common thug.  Talman imbues him with complexities that if you don't sympathize with him at least there is a glimmer of empathy.  Truth be told in the script by Steve Fisher there are shadings of good and bad in all the principal characters whether it be a patrolman (Gig Young) who is contemplating leaving his wife for a showgirl or the unscrupulous lawyer (Edward Arnold) dealing with the duplicities of his trophy wife.  The one thing I didn't buy was the introduction of a supernatural element that to me was an ill fit for the noir trappings.  I've read the other reviews on this page some more critical than others and even the ones I don't necessarily agree with have a point.  ""City That Never Sleeps"" is far from a perfect film but one that elicits a reaction so it is worth pursuing.",5,Chicago Rides Shotgun In My Patrol Car,1367020800,"04 27, 2013",2013,1409,"['most', 'striking', 'thing', 'film', 'John', 'L.', 'Russell', 'evocative', 'cinematography', 'Chicago', 'cityscape', 'so', 'overpowering', 'overwhelm', 'character', 'storytelling', 'initial', 'reaction', 'here', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'too', 'many', 'relationships', 'interrelationships', 'film', 'overplotted', 'point', 'however', 'film', 'where', 'equillibrium', 'opinion', 'when', 'are', 'introduced', 'character', 'named', 'Hayes', 'Stewart', 'played', 'William', 'Talman', 'who', 'would', 'later', 'be', 'better', 'known', 'Hamilton', 'Burger', 'old', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'TV', 'show', 'surface', 'Stewart', 'common', 'thug', 'Talman', 'complexities', 'do', ""n't"", 'sympathize', 'least', 'glimmer', 'empathy', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', 'script', 'Steve', 'Fisher', 'are', 'shadings', 'good', 'bad', 'principal', 'characters', 'be', 'patrolman', 'Gig', 'Young', 'who', 'contemplating', 'leaving', 'wife', 'showgirl', 'unscrupulous', 'lawyer', 'Edward', 'Arnold', 'dealing', 'duplicities', 'trophy', 'wife', 'one', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'was', 'introduction', 'supernatural', 'element', 'was', 'ill', 'fit', 'noir', 'trappings', ""'ve"", 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'page', 'more', 'critical', 'others', 'even', 'ones', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'agree', 'have', 'point', 'City', 'That', 'Never', 'Sleeps', 'far', 'perfect', 'film', 'one', 'reaction', 'worth', 'pursuing']",N/A

Of the two I think this is by far the best, and it has a rafter of people hitting up against a wall of noirish problems.  The basic story is a young patrolman wants to quit his job, and run off with his showgirl (taxi dancer) mistress and leave his loving wife behind: all because, darn it, she earns more money than he does.  His dad is a lifelong cop nearing retirement, and his kid brother is enraptured with thug life.  On top of the showgirl has another admirer, a fellow entertainer, who has daydreams that are both scary and pathetic, all of which center on the girl, who is due to take off with the cop.  Edward Arnold pulls many strings behind the scenes as a corrupt lawyer, William Talman is a desperate thug, and Marie Windsor (who else?) plays the bad girl to the hilt.

243766,A8BC52NCCFEWH,6301039017,"Spike Owen ""John Rouse Merriott Chard""","[4, 5]","Chicago cop Johnny Kelly wants to run away, from his job with the police force, and from his perceived mundane marriage. Hoping to flee Chicago with his stripper girlfriend Angel Face, he keeps putting it off with bouts of cold feet. Then one night when Johnny is assigned a new partner, Angel finally grows tired of false hopes and promises, just as Johnny is tempted by the dark side to finally realise both their dreams, but other factors are heading their way.....Directed by John H. Auer and starring Gig Young as Kelly, City That Never Sleeps was brought to us out of the low budget Republic Pictures studio. Oddly fusing film-noir with fantastical elements makes for a most intriguing watch, yet it's very much a slog to get to a point where you feel your time has been worth it. But crucially it is worth the wait, lots of character strands all thread together to give us an exciting, and well executed climax, tho the fantastical finish point is something of a head scratcher to me personally. It's a weird film in many ways, and one that probably needs repeat viewings to fully grasp {and appreciate} what the hell is going on with all these characters. The weird feel is emphasised by John L. Russell's {Psycho & The Cabinet of Caligari} grimly lighted photography, who utilises the sparseness of the actual Chicago locations to great effect.Known to be a favourite film of Martin Scorsese, City That Never Sleeps is actually a little better than it's B movie tagging. But it remains a film that one feels should have been much better. It's alright to fuse more than a couple of genre's, but you have to make it work convincingly within the structure of the plot{s}, and realistically they only just manage to pull it off, courtesy of a fine, if weird, ending. 6/10 but it could go either way upon a further viewing.",3,"It works, but it's very much an oddity.",1317254400,"09 29, 2011",2011,1827,"['Chicago', 'cop', 'Johnny', 'Kelly', 'run', 'away', 'job', 'police', 'force', 'perceived', 'mundane', 'marriage', 'Hoping', 'flee', 'Chicago', 'stripper', 'girlfriend', 'Angel', 'Face', 'putting', 'off', 'bouts', 'cold', 'feet', 'Then', 'one', 'night', 'when', 'Johnny', 'assigned', 'new', 'partner', 'Angel', 'finally', 'tired', 'false', 'hopes', 'promises', 'just', 'Johnny', 'tempted', 'dark', 'side', 'finally', 'realise', 'dreams', 'other', 'factors', 'are', 'heading', 'way', '..Directed', 'John', 'H.', 'Auer', 'starring', 'Gig', 'Young', 'Kelly', 'City', 'That', 'Never', 'Sleeps', 'was', 'brought', 'low', 'budget', 'Republic', 'Pictures', 'studio', 'Oddly', 'fusing', 'film-noir', 'fantastical', 'elements', 'most', 'intriguing', 'watch', 'very', 'much', 'slog', 'get', 'point', 'where', 'feel', 'time', 'been', 'crucially', 'wait', 'lots', 'character', 'strands', 'thread', 'together', 'give', 'exciting', 'well', 'executed', 'climax', 'tho', 'fantastical', 'finish', 'point', 'something', 'head', 'scratcher', 'personally', 'weird', 'film', 'many', 'ways', 'one', 'probably', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'fully', 'grasp', 'appreciate', 'what', 'hell', 'going', 'characters', 'weird', 'feel', 'emphasised', 'John', 'L.', 'Russell', 'Psycho', 'Cabinet', 'Caligari', 'grimly', 'lighted', 'photography', 'who', 'sparseness', 'actual', 'Chicago', 'locations', 'great', 'effect.Known', 'be', 'favourite', 'film', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'City', 'That', 'Never', 'Sleeps', 'actually', 'little', 'better', 'B', 'movie', 'tagging', 'film', 'one', 'feels', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'alright', 'fuse', 'more', 'couple', 'genre', 'have', 'make', 'work', 'convincingly', 'structure', 'plot', 's', 'realistically', 'only', 'just', 'manage', 'pull', 'off', 'courtesy', 'fine', 'weird', 'ending', '6/10', 'could', 'go', 'way', 'further', 'viewing']",N/A
243767,A2Q457CES5ZUZ,6301039017,William Hare,"[19, 21]","Gig Young was a highly talented film actor who suffered the misfortune of being type cast all too often as the ""other man"" rather than handling the lead, which he was more than capable of doing.  When he won a well-deserved Oscar for the Depression mood piece ""They Shoot Horses, Don't They?"" it was in the Best Supporting Actor category.In the brilliantly conceived and beautifully done 1953 Republic police drama ""City That Never Sleeps"" Young is the lead performer, and one with a challenging role of wearing his dissatisfaction as a Chicago policeman on his sleeve as he juggles two beautiful women, a loving wife at home and a nightclub exotic dancer with whom he considers fulfilling a dream of moving to California and starting a new life.Mala Powers plays the role of the dancer.  She has two men interested in marrying her and after Young initially fails to go the extra mile she tells him that she will instead go off with a co-worker who plays the role of a mechanical man in the window in front of the nightclub.When Young realizes that there is no tomorrow where Powers is concerned, he agrees to divorce his wife and marry her.  In conjunction with that decision Young will work his police beat one more night, resign, then face the music at home and tell his wife that their marriage is over.Before going out for his last night on patrol Young is corralled by fellow police officer and father Otto Hulett, who has heard from Young's wife and wonders what is wrong with him.  He gives his father a noncommittal response, deciding to face the music later.When he goes down to the garage Young is told that his regular partner has called in sick with an earache.  An officer he has never met, a stranger, enters the scene.  Chill Wills plays the sergeant who will ride along with Young for the evening.One senses a note of mystery with Wills from the beginning.  He asks questions without prodding, and quickly concludes that Young is a very miserable man.  Wills takes on the element of a Greek chorus and his full impact and station will not be revealed until the end of the film in an intriguing way.Young's evening turns into a wild roller coaster ride that tests his inner being and forces him to look inside himself to determine where and how his life will proceed from that point.  A pivotal event revolves around veteran criminal defense attorney, played by Edward Arnold, seeking to make a deal with Young to arrest his sleight-of-hand prot&eacute;g&eacute;, played by William Tallman.  Unknown to him, Tallman has plans for him, with the engineering being done by Arnold's faithless wife.Playing Arnold's wife is a veteran of film noir style roles, Marie Windsor, who directs the action as she makes a move toward Tallman and provides him with the goods to do her husband in professionally.  The trick lies in extracting the right price.Also thrown into the mix is the younger brother of Young, who idolizes shrewd con artist Tallman, who is a former magician, and wants to join forces with him.  When Tallman agrees to take him out on a job that night it throws the nave young man directly into the path of his policeman brother.To divulge anymore about what happens that night in Chicago would involve spoiling an intricate plot with plenty of surprise twists that should be experienced without tip-offs.  Veteran scenarist and crime writer Steve Fisher, who wrote the script for Robert Montgomery's excellent Raymond Chandler adaptation ""The Lady in the Lake,"" was in clever form on ""City That Never Sleeps"" while veteran director John Auer keeps the action moving while utilizing the city's fascinating scenery, with many effective night shots being supplied by cinematographer John L. Russell.One of the admirable features of this film is the way that all of the aforementioned principal players interact with Young as the evening progresses and life and death situations arise.  Each affects Young a certain way, and at the end he reevaluates his life and career in a profoundly different way, shaped by the events of that pivotal evening.",5,"Brilliant Police Drama, Superb Final Twist",1172188800,"02 23, 2007",2007,4067,"['Gig', 'Young', 'was', 'highly', 'talented', 'film', 'actor', 'who', 'suffered', 'misfortune', 'being', 'type', 'cast', 'too', 'often', 'other', 'man', 'rather', 'handling', 'lead', 'was', 'more', 'capable', 'doing', 'When', 'won', 'well-deserved', 'Oscar', 'Depression', 'mood', 'piece', 'Shoot', 'Horses', 'Do', ""n't"", 'was', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'category.In', 'brilliantly', 'conceived', 'beautifully', 'done', '1953', 'Republic', 'police', 'drama', 'City', 'That', 'Never', 'Sleeps', 'Young', 'lead', 'performer', 'one', 'challenging', 'role', 'wearing', 'dissatisfaction', 'Chicago', 'policeman', 'sleeve', 'two', 'beautiful', 'women', 'loving', 'wife', 'home', 'nightclub', 'exotic', 'dancer', 'whom', 'fulfilling', 'dream', 'moving', 'California', 'starting', 'new', 'life.Mala', 'Powers', 'role', 'dancer', 'two', 'men', 'interested', 'marrying', 'Young', 'initially', 'go', 'extra', 'mile', 'will', 'instead', 'go', 'off', 'co-worker', 'who', 'role', 'mechanical', 'man', 'window', 'front', 'nightclub.When', 'Young', 'tomorrow', 'where', 'Powers', 'concerned', 'divorce', 'wife', 'marry', 'conjunction', 'decision', 'Young', 'will', 'work', 'police', 'beat', 'one', 'more', 'night', 'resign', 'then', 'face', 'music', 'home', 'tell', 'wife', 'marriage', 'over.Before', 'going', 'out', 'last', 'night', 'patrol', 'Young', 'corralled', 'fellow', 'police', 'officer', 'father', 'Otto', 'Hulett', 'who', 'heard', 'Young', 'wife', 'wonders', 'what', 'wrong', 'father', 'noncommittal', 'response', 'deciding', 'face', 'music', 'later.When', 'down', 'garage', 'Young', 'told', 'regular', 'partner', 'called', 'sick', 'earache', 'officer', 'never', 'met', 'stranger', 'scene', 'Chill', 'Wills', 'sergeant', 'who', 'will', 'ride', 'Young', 'evening.One', 'note', 'mystery', 'Wills', 'beginning', 'questions', 'prodding', 'quickly', 'Young', 'very', 'miserable', 'man', 'Wills', 'element', 'Greek', 'chorus', 'full', 'impact', 'station', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'revealed', 'end', 'film', 'intriguing', 'way.Young', 'evening', 'wild', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', 'inner', 'being', 'forces', 'look', 'inside', 'determine', 'where', 'how', 'life', 'will', 'proceed', 'point', 'pivotal', 'event', 'revolves', 'veteran', 'criminal', 'defense', 'attorney', 'played', 'Edward', 'Arnold', 'seeking', 'make', 'deal', 'Young', 'arrest', 'sleight-of-hand', 'prot', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'played', 'William', 'Tallman', 'Unknown', 'Tallman', 'plans', 'engineering', 'being', 'done', 'Arnold', 'faithless', 'wife.Playing', 'Arnold', 'wife', 'veteran', 'film', 'noir', 'style', 'roles', 'Marie', 'Windsor', 'who', 'action', 'move', 'Tallman', 'goods', 'do', 'husband', 'professionally', 'trick', 'extracting', 'right', 'price.Also', 'thrown', 'mix', 'younger', 'brother', 'Young', 'who', 'shrewd', 'con', 'artist', 'Tallman', 'who', 'former', 'magician', 'join', 'forces', 'When', 'Tallman', 'take', 'out', 'job', 'night', 'nave', 'young', 'man', 'directly', 'path', 'policeman', 'brother.To', 'divulge', 'anymore', 'what', 'night', 'Chicago', 'would', 'involve', 'spoiling', 'intricate', 'plot', 'plenty', 'surprise', 'twists', 'should', 'be', 'experienced', 'tip-offs', 'Veteran', 'scenarist', 'crime', 'writer', 'Steve', 'Fisher', 'who', 'wrote', 'script', 'Robert', 'Montgomery', 'excellent', 'Raymond', 'Chandler', 'adaptation', 'Lady', 'Lake', 'was', 'clever', 'form', 'City', 'That', 'Never', 'Sleeps', 'veteran', 'director', 'John', 'Auer', 'action', 'moving', 'utilizing', 'city', 'fascinating', 'scenery', 'many', 'effective', 'night', 'shots', 'being', 'supplied', 'cinematographer', 'John', 'L.', 'Russell.One', 'admirable', 'features', 'film', 'way', 'aforementioned', 'principal', 'players', 'interact', 'Young', 'evening', 'progresses', 'life', 'death', 'situations', 'arise', 'Young', 'certain', 'way', 'end', 'life', 'career', 'profoundly', 'different', 'way', 'shaped', 'events', 'pivotal', 'evening']",N/A
