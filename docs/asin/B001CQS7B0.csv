First, the music is terrible--just awful. Second, the characters are unpleasant, inconsistent and STUPID. You show me a cop who is as dull-witted as this guy, and I will show you someone who does NOT GET PROMOTED!!  Third, there were so many holes in the plot and the logic that I found myself wondering who on earth they wrote this for. Do they really think viewers won't notice these idiotic gaps and facile gimmicks? Forth, so much was stolen from Dexter that they should be sued.I call it obscene not because of the prurient subject matter--sexual predators--but because of its utter lack of redeeming value. That is my definition of obscenity: to feed an audience this kind of drivel and expect them to lap it up and come back for more.

1177352,AFSTQOHFR6HFQ,B001CQS7B0,Gary Anderson,"[39, 41]","A few years ago I discovered this show called ""Durham County"" which is shown in Canada.  Soon after I began watching it I realized this is a special type show.  It was like nothing I had really watched before, as most shows, at least here in the US, tend to be ""Safe"".  There are exceptions such as Sons of Anarchy or Dexter or The Shield, but by and large most shows have a ""we won't cross this line"" mentality that prevents it from seriously going in a direction that might be seen as offputting to a number of viewers.Thankfully Durham County's network does not have that mentality, and so it has allowed this brilliant show to be crafted in a way that is unsettling and not at all ""safe"".  The show is completely unpredictable and in fact the one thing that IS predictable is how you will feel afterwards.  Kinda icky. And that's a great thing I think. Anytime a show can create these emotions inside you that make you question what you just watched is brilliant in my mind.The only show that really approaches this in the sense of ""oh my God he's not going to...oh he just did!"" is probably Dexter. Dexter is a show that essentially has you rooting for a serial killer to get away with it.  Perhaps because the people that he kills are all bad people.  We know this watching it, so when he kills a pedophile or a child killer or a guy who killed his wife, we don't really feel that bad.  We know killing is wrong, but we know 100% that the people he's killing are guilty and are getting away with it.  So that makes it okay, if even in a questionable morals type of way.Durham is much the same, only in a different way.  Durham is about Detective Mike Sweeney, played by Hugh Dillon (TV's Flashpoint) who after his partner is killed relocates with his family to the suburbs of Durham County.  Unknowingly he moves across the street from his old high school nemesis Ray Prager who is played by Justin Louis (TV's Stargate Universe).  Louis' Prager is a creepy and easily angered guy who never really made anything of himself.  His kid hates him, his marriage is falling apart, and as the show opens up he's spying on a man who kills two girls in the woods.And he does nothing.  Except watch. You get the impression that he's turned on by this combination of sex and violence, which can not be a good thing.  Anyone that's watched any episodes of Law & Order: SVU knows that this is not a healthy combo.Soon the girls are discovered, and Sweeney begins to set his sight on his old enemy, and has his motives questioned due to their uneasy history.The interactions between Hugh Dillon and Justin Louis are spectacular and you can absolutely just taste the dislike between their characters.  Their hatred of each other is palpable, all the while they dance around and and act like they want to make things work out.There's an especially great scene near the end of Season 1 where Prager is being interrogated by Sweeney and these two great actors just nail every single moment, making what could have been a routine scene that we've seen a hundred times, into something great with unbelievable tension hanging in the air thick as smoke.Unfolding over six episodes the series is filled with moments that make you squirm, that disturb you and make you want to take a shower quickly after it's over.  However what the show won't do is leave you without thinking about it.  It's so well done, so excellently shot and presented that it's impossible to watch this show and not have some thoughts about it.  It's not a show that you watch it and just forget about it.  It stays with you long after watching it, for good or for bad.  It is filled with moments that reach out and grab you and forces you to look at yourself and how you feel about the things you're seeing.It's not violent for violent's sake.  It's not brutal for the sake of brutality.  It's not done in a gratuitous way where you look at it and think ""now did they REALLY need that?""  It's all done in a deliberate way in order to provoke thought and discussion.Unlike many shows here in the states, there is only six episodes to a season, so there's no room for filler.  There's no episodes that don't further the mystery or the storylines, like you see in series that run on for 20+ episodes a season.  This means that every episode means something.  Every episode has something to say and it's up to you to pay attention and follow everything.Viewers should be warned that in addition to the disturbing content involving murders, there is also a good deal of adult language and there is some nudity/sexual situations.  This is DEFINITELY not for kids or those who are easily offended.However it IS for those who love intelligent television that doesn't treat it's audience like idiots that need everything handed to them on a plate in the way of an explanation. The show ends on a note that doesn't wrap everything up.  Some of the story continues in Season 2  especially concerning Ray Prager and his effects on Sweeney's family life.Both Sweeney and Louis were outstanding in this show and both were rightly nominated for Best Actor Gemini awards, (kind of like the Canadian Emmys) with Justin Louis winning it for his complex portrayal of a very bad person who perhaps has a reason for why he's so bad.Helene Joy (who portrays Mike Sweeney's wife) won for Best Actress as well, and Sonya Salomaa (Ray Prager's Wife) and Laurence LeBoeuf (Mike Sweeney's daughter) were both nominated for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress respectively.This is a brilliant show and is one of my top 5 all time (along with The Wire, Carnivale, Dexter, and Lost)",5,"Durham County is a brilliant, yet dark and disturbing

It's a great crime drama that I am really surprised hasn't had any advertising on any other channel.  It has great characters with depth, mystery/crime plots, along with some family drama, great sets, slightly creepy, sometimes super creepy, great acting...what can I say, I love the show.  I am so thrilled to have a second season coming out, the first on dvd, and that a non-big three station ran such a great new show...hopefully to inspire many great new shows that couldn't get aired by networks or get cancelled by networks etc.  Why should the non big 3 be stuck with re-runs of former big three shows when they can obviously do a great job choosing new series of their own?YAHOO...A LITTLE TV STATION/NON BIG-THREE WITH A GREAT NEW PRIMETIME SERIES!!!!I love that cable channels have had some successful series over the last few years  that have blown the networks away and now to have ION run a new series that is so much better than much of the BIG Three, it really makes me hopeful that the whole ""big three"" being the only people who get budget for new series runs and the only ones who get advertising money etc. will end fairly soon.  Some of the best series in recent years have been from networks other than the ""big three"" and yet, the industry still focuses on them and let them ""run the world"" in television.  I just want quality programming with quality stories and quality acting with the only agenda being....quality tv.  That can't be done in the big three anymore, or so it seems.  They would have never run Supernatural or Smallville, or Monk, Saving Grace would never have a chance on the big 3, Damages, they cancelled Friday Night Lights, sending them to Directv only to want them back because why? After DTV gave them more than one season to resonate with fans, it was successful.  They cancel so many shows in every genre after such a short time, even some with great ratings and fan bases, always thinking the grass is greener on the other side, but so rare is it to have a big hit after 2 episodes and then stay at number one that they constantly give up really quality programming with good ratings for the hope they will be number one next time and stay there....eventually ending in many failed series because they weren't any good, and many cancelled series that may have lasted years and years if given the chance.  My examples could go on endlessly, I watched The Nine and Smith and Davinci's Inquest on network tv only to have them all just disappear.  When DTV ran the rest of The Nine and Smith, I was even more bummed that they had been cancelled in the first place, they were both very good.  Davinci is in a league of it's own, some of the best ever tv, and only got a couple primetime eps aired in my area, then moved to 1:05am. then moved to 12 noon, and then disappeared...When SLEUTH started running the whole series (half of which I bought on dvd from Canada), I watched it over and over and found new things to appreciate everytime...it could have been huge here if it was given a solid, consistent timeslot for a season or two...........UGH, I get really worked up about the dreadful network monopolies that mess with my entertainment.Sadly, all the little channels and great cable networks will probably be bought out by the big three eventually and we'll be stuck with only what the same small gene pool of executives finds appealing  and a show like Durham County won't have a chance....WHERE'S my BEHopeful Attitude?!!! I slipped for a moment, it makes me hopeful that ion ran this show, a news primetime series, that is really good, very unique, suspensful, great acting...overall, a quality, creepy, Crime show!",5,"Wow, great series",1264118400,"01 22, 2010",2010,3847,"['only', 'caught', 'chance', 'when', 'searching', 'new', 'series', 'tv', 'past', 'fall', 'summer', 'whenever', 'started', 'as', 'soon', 'watched', 'first', 'episode', 'had', 'season', 'Pass', 'great', 'crime', 'drama', 'am', 'really', 'surprised', ""n't"", 'had', 'advertising', 'other', 'channel', 'great', 'characters', 'depth', 'mystery/crime', 'plots', 'family', 'drama', 'great', 'sets', 'slightly', 'creepy', 'sometimes', 'super', 'creepy', 'great', 'acting', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'love', 'show', 'am', 'so', 'thrilled', 'have', 'second', 'season', 'coming', 'out', 'first', 'dvd', 'non-big', 'three', 'station', 'ran', 'great', 'new', 'show', 'hopefully', 'inspire', 'many', 'great', 'new', 'shows', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'aired', 'networks', 'get', 'cancelled', 'networks', 'etc', 'Why', 'should', 'non', 'big', '3', 'be', 'stuck', 're-runs', 'former', 'big', 'three', 'shows', 'when', 'can', 'obviously', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'choosing', 'new', 'series', 'own', 'YAHOO', 'LITTLE', 'TV', 'STATION/NON', 'BIG-THREE', 'WITH', 'A', 'GREAT', 'NEW', 'PRIMETIME', 'SERIES', 'love', 'cable', 'channels', 'have', 'had', 'successful', 'series', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'have', 'blown', 'networks', 'away', 'now', 'have', 'ION', 'run', 'new', 'series', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'much', 'BIG', 'Three', 'really', 'hopeful', 'whole', 'big', 'three', 'being', 'only', 'people', 'who', 'get', 'budget', 'new', 'series', 'runs', 'only', 'ones', 'who', 'get', 'advertising', 'money', 'etc', 'will', 'end', 'fairly', 'soon', 'best', 'series', 'recent', 'years', 'have', 'been', 'networks', 'other', 'big', 'three', 'yet', 'industry', 'still', 'let', 'run', 'world', 'television', 'just', 'want', 'quality', 'programming', 'quality', 'stories', 'quality', 'acting', 'only', 'agenda', 'being', '.quality', 'tv', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'done', 'big', 'three', 'anymore', 'so', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'run', 'Supernatural', 'Smallville', 'Monk', 'Saving', 'Grace', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'chance', 'big', '3', 'Damages', 'cancelled', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'sending', 'Directv', 'only', 'want', 'back', 'why', 'DTV', 'gave', 'more', 'one', 'season', 'resonate', 'fans', 'was', 'successful', 'cancel', 'so', 'many', 'shows', 'genre', 'short', 'time', 'even', 'great', 'ratings', 'fan', 'bases', 'always', 'thinking', 'grass', 'greener', 'other', 'side', 'so', 'rare', 'have', 'big', 'hit', '2', 'episodes', 'then', 'stay', 'number', 'one', 'constantly', 'give', 'up', 'really', 'quality', 'programming', 'good', 'ratings', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'number', 'one', 'next', 'time', 'stay', 'there', '.eventually', 'ending', 'many', 'failed', 'series', 'were', ""n't"", 'good', 'many', 'cancelled', 'series', 'may', 'have', 'lasted', 'years', 'years', 'given', 'chance', 'examples', 'could', 'go', 'endlessly', 'watched', 'Nine', 'Smith', 'Davinci', 'Inquest', 'network', 'tv', 'only', 'have', 'just', 'disappear', 'When', 'DTV', 'ran', 'rest', 'Nine', 'Smith', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'bummed', 'had', 'been', 'cancelled', 'first', 'place', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'Davinci', 'league', 'own', 'best', 'ever', 'tv', 'only', 'got', 'couple', 'primetime', 'eps', 'aired', 'area', 'then', 'moved', '1:05am', 'then', 'moved', '12', 'noon', 'then', 'disappeared', 'When', 'SLEUTH', 'started', 'running', 'whole', 'series', 'half', 'bought', 'dvd', 'Canada', 'watched', 'found', 'new', 'things', 'appreciate', 'everytime', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'huge', 'here', 'was', 'given', 'solid', 'consistent', 'timeslot', 'season', 'two', '..UGH', 'get', 'really', 'worked', 'up', 'dreadful', 'network', 'monopolies', 'mess', 'entertainment.Sadly', 'little', 'channels', 'great', 'cable', 'networks', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'bought', 'out', 'big', 'three', 'eventually', ""'ll"", 'be', 'stuck', 'only', 'what', 'same', 'small', 'gene', 'pool', 'executives', 'finds', 'appealing', 'show', 'Durham', 'County', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'chance', '.WHERE', 'BEHopeful', 'Attitude', 'slipped', 'moment', 'hopeful', 'ion', 'ran', 'show', 'news', 'primetime', 'series', 'really', 'good', 'very', 'unique', 'suspensful', 'great', 'acting', 'overall', 'quality', 'creepy', 'Crime', 'show']",Durham County Ssn 1
