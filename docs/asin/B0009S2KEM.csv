I don't care how low budget a movie is, if the viewers can't SEE it then how can they like it.  It looks like it was shot on someone's home video.  There is no spit and polish to give the impression that any effort was made on this film.

911417,A2K7CVIVEWDOVN,B0009S2KEM,brian tunick,"[5, 8]","I read these reviews and I'm forced to wonder what people expected when the rented a movie called `Hood of the Living Dead'.  I mean, James Cameron clearly had nothing to do with this one.  It was shot on a very small budget and that was apparent from the cover.  We live in a great time when a 20 year fan of the genre that is `zombie' can walk in to a video store and rent a new zombie movie once a month.  We all know that one way to kill a zombie is to remove the head or destroy the brain.  However, my fear is that zombies will be rendered extinct by bad reviews.If you like zombies, you will like this movie.  It has that feeling of impending doom and apocalypse that made the genre successful in the first place.  The gore is not top-notch, but it is very passable.  It's racial (as should be expected) without being racist.  Zombies don't care about color, and that seems to be an underlying theme that runs throughout the movie.  The characters are believable, and there are very few plot flaws.  The movie has plenty of laughs without losing its generally serious tone.  And there's even homage to George Romero.  You can't have a zombie movie without borrowing from Romero's original; it's nice to see that acknowledged.`Hood of the Living Dead' is an enjoyable movie.  It does not rival anything ever in theatres for best special effect category, but let's face it, most zombie movies don't.  If you're a fan of the genre, check it out, if you like big budget, move along.  Just don't try to dissuade others who might not have unrealistic expectations of a B-movie.  The zombie species is currently thriving, but they need audiences as well as human flesh.",5,Zombies In Da Hood,1140134400,"02 17, 2006",2006,1669,"['read', 'reviews', ""'m"", 'forced', 'wonder', 'what', 'people', 'expected', 'when', 'rented', 'movie', 'called', 'Hood', 'Living', 'Dead', 'mean', 'James', 'Cameron', 'clearly', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'one', 'was', 'shot', 'very', 'small', 'budget', 'was', 'apparent', 'cover', 'live', 'great', 'time', 'when', '20', 'year', 'fan', 'genre', 'zombie', 'can', 'walk', 'video', 'store', 'rent', 'new', 'zombie', 'movie', 'once', 'month', 'know', 'one', 'way', 'kill', 'zombie', 'remove', 'head', 'destroy', 'brain', 'However', 'fear', 'zombies', 'will', 'be', 'rendered', 'extinct', 'bad', 'reviews.If', 'zombies', 'will', 'like', 'movie', 'feeling', 'impending', 'doom', 'apocalypse', 'made', 'genre', 'successful', 'first', 'place', 'gore', 'not', 'top-notch', 'very', 'passable', 'racial', 'should', 'be', 'expected', 'being', 'racist', 'Zombies', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'color', 'be', 'underlying', 'theme', 'movie', 'characters', 'are', 'believable', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'plot', 'flaws', 'movie', 'plenty', 'laughs', 'losing', 'generally', 'serious', 'tone', 'even', 'homage', 'George', 'Romero', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'zombie', 'movie', 'borrowing', 'Romero', 'original', 'nice', 'see', 'acknowledged.', 'Hood', 'Living', 'Dead', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'not', 'rival', 'anything', 'ever', 'theatres', 'best', 'special', 'effect', 'category', 'let', 'face', 'most', 'zombie', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", ""'re"", 'fan', 'genre', 'check', 'out', 'like', 'big', 'budget', 'move', 'along', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'dissuade', 'others', 'who', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'unrealistic', 'expectations', 'B-movie', 'zombie', 'species', 'currently', 'thriving', 'need', 'audiences', 'as', 'well', 'human', 'flesh']",Hood of the Living Dead

911421,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0009S2KEM,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 1]","Hood of the Living Dead (The Quiroz Brothers, 2004)It is only the fact that I saw Venice Underground and the remake of The Wicker Man in the same weekend as this that stops Hood of the Living Dead from garnering the title of Worst Movie I've Seen So Far This Year. I mean, this is abominable-- it's bad filmmaking without any of the benefits of Midnight Skater. In fact, I cannot think of a single thing to say in this movies defense except that it's not Venice Underground or the remake of The Wicker Man.In what passes thinly for something that may have at one time resembled a plot, Scott (Chris Angelo) and Ricky (Carl Washington, who has the bad fortune to have starred in both Quiroz Bros. And Daniel Zirrilli movies within a year of one another-- surely the kiss of death for any aspiring actor) are scientists working for Dr. Richards (Solo por Hoy's Victor Zaragoza) on a formula to speed cell regeneration. When Scotty's brother Jermaine (Dope Game 2's Brandon Daniels in his second appearance on film) is killed in a drive-by, Ricky and Scott use the formula on him. When it doesn't seem to work, Jermaine is taken away in an ambulance, and Ricky vows revenge on the shooters, recruiting Jermaine's gangsta-wannabe friends to gun them down. Which would normally start a gang war, but not here-- the formula did work, turning Jermaine into a zombie who's bent on his own revenge-- turning the shooters into zombies. Yes, I'm serious. Zombie gang wars, folks.Actually, think about it-- that would have been a pretty funny concept. However, the Quiroz Brothers never pick it up and run with it, instead focusing on the scientists and their hired-mercenary help trying to survive the zombie onslaught. (Read ""onslaught"" here as ""a handful of easily killed walking dead people"".) It's no-budget silliness, but as Midnight Skater showed, no-budget silliness can be great if you've got a meaty script and some original ideas. Hood of the Living Dead has neither; it stumbles into every convention there is and does nothing at all original with them. *",1,"If you need to ask if this movie is good, you're in the wrong place.",1173744000,"03 13, 2007",2007,2055,"['Hood', 'Living', 'Dead', 'Quiroz', 'Brothers', '2004', 'only', 'fact', 'saw', 'Venice', 'Underground', 'remake', 'Wicker', 'Man', 'same', 'weekend', 'Hood', 'Living', 'Dead', 'garnering', 'title', 'Worst', 'Movie', ""'ve"", 'Seen', 'So', 'Far', 'Year', 'mean', 'abominable', 'bad', 'filmmaking', 'benefits', 'Midnight', 'Skater', 'fact', 'can', 'not', 'think', 'single', 'thing', 'say', 'movies', 'defense', 'not', 'Venice', 'Underground', 'remake', 'Wicker', 'Man.In', 'what', 'thinly', 'something', 'may', 'have', 'one', 'time', 'resembled', 'plot', 'Scott', 'Chris', 'Angelo', 'Ricky', 'Carl', 'Washington', 'who', 'bad', 'fortune', 'have', 'starred', 'Quiroz', 'Bros.', 'Daniel', 'Zirrilli', 'movies', 'year', 'one', 'surely', 'kiss', 'death', 'aspiring', 'actor', 'are', 'scientists', 'working', 'Dr.', 'Richards', 'Solo', 'por', 'Hoy', 'Victor', 'Zaragoza', 'formula', 'speed', 'cell', 'regeneration', 'When', 'Scotty', 'brother', 'Jermaine', 'Dope', 'Game', '2', 'Brandon', 'Daniels', 'second', 'appearance', 'film', 'killed', 'drive-by', 'Ricky', 'Scott', 'use', 'formula', 'When', ""n't"", 'seem', 'work', 'Jermaine', 'taken', 'away', 'ambulance', 'Ricky', 'revenge', 'shooters', 'recruiting', 'Jermaine', 'gangsta-wannabe', 'friends', 'gun', 'down', 'Which', 'would', 'normally', 'start', 'gang', 'war', 'not', 'here', 'formula', 'did', 'work', 'turning', 'Jermaine', 'zombie', 'who', 'bent', 'own', 'revenge', 'turning', 'shooters', 'zombies', 'Yes', ""'m"", 'serious', 'Zombie', 'gang', 'wars', 'folks.Actually', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'pretty', 'funny', 'concept', 'However', 'Quiroz', 'Brothers', 'never', 'pick', 'up', 'run', 'instead', 'focusing', 'scientists', 'hired-mercenary', 'help', 'trying', 'survive', 'zombie', 'onslaught', 'Read', 'onslaught', 'here', 'handful', 'easily', 'killed', 'walking', 'dead', 'people', 'no-budget', 'silliness', 'Midnight', 'Skater', 'showed', 'no-budget', 'silliness', 'can', 'be', 'great', ""'ve"", 'got', 'meaty', 'script', 'original', 'ideas', 'Hood', 'Living', 'Dead', 'neither', 'convention', 'nothing', 'original', '*']",Hood of the Living Dead

911424,A2W82ICVTTYAOY,B0009S2KEM,Zombob,"[0, 0]","sigh...at least it was better than 'Zombiez'...1) ACTING: Pretty much, it was hit and miss. Some of the actors were okay, and some were pretty rough. The lead character needed to be played by someone with more acting experience. He would've have been okay as a supporting character, but as the lead (who was also a scientist) he wasn't convincing.2) PRODUCTION: This was filmed on whatever is the next film machine up from a camcorder. Some dark scenes not lit really well. So-so soundtrack, no heavy metal music, but some hip-hop songs here and there. I enjoyed the ""stunt phone."" It seemed whenever a cell phone needed to be dropped, it was always the same kind that hit the ground, even though we would see different cell phones with different characters at the time of use.3) ZOMBIES: Snyder runners all the way. Nothing new here, except zombie-Jermaine remains loyal to his brother when he is attacked by another zombie. ""Love transcends all bounderies""...?4) SPECIAL EFFECTS: Mad scientists with Mountain Dew in a beaker just doesn't cut it. The gore wasn't too bad, but reaching UNDER people shirts to gut them should only be used once or twice. Some of the budget should be spent on at least one good gut tearing scene. (IT IS a zombie movie, for pete's sake!) Having victims being attacked and seeing the aftermath of the victims just laying there with blood on them doesn't work either. (or, at least, not in abundance) And God forbid, I realize that white t-shirts show off the best blood, but when the majority of the cast is wearing them and then dying, it becomes noticable. (It was like the ""red shirts"" from 'Star Trek.')5) THE CAUSE: Man made experimental formula, trying to revitalize dying cells.Overall, a pretty typical lousy zombie movie.
