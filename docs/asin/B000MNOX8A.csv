1047856,A3HP7JU4ZORF52,B000MNOX8A,Anja Rebekka Schultze,"[0, 0]","This film is typical swords and sorcery fare, centuries before the start of the movie the conflict between a king's two sons split a nation into two and they have been at war since. At the start of the movie one of those nations is set to be annihilated by the other, in desperation the king have his court sorcerer summon the nation's old defender, a Gryphon, things however go downhill from there when the sorcerer uses his new pet monster to try to conquer both the nations and unite them under his rule. What follows is a fetch quest where the prince from one of the nations and the princess from the other have to join forces to try to destroy the sorcerer.This movie is one big fetch quest, but there is enough interesting characters and plot twists to keep it fun, this is a movie that do not stray from it's genre at all, but it do what it do fairly well. I had allot of fun watching the movie. Now if you are expecting Lord of the Rings then you will not get that here, however as a fun little flick to provide a hour and a half of entertainment then Attack of the Gryphon works well.My biggest problem with this movie is the special effects, the title character the Gryphon looks like it comes straight out of a Playstation 2 game, the computer graphics really is terrible. Now this usually can be excused as long as the story is good, however here the CG is so horrible it is really disturbing, especially when actors have to interact with their sprite monster. There is a scene where the sorcerer is petting the Gryphon on the beak, and seriously the actor's hand is 10 cm over the beak as not only have they made a bag CG creature they have integrated it into the film poorly to. I will say however that the creators of this movie have been smart enough to know their limitations, the Gryphon is not in that many scenes so the problem of the bad CG is limited.The acting of this film is so so, the actors overplay allot and the acting can be a bit uneven, but considering the type of movie we are talking about this can be forgiven. Attack of the Gryphon is a cheap swords and sorcery fantasy flick, but it works and a B movies go it is rather good.",3,Rather good swords and socery B movie.,1309219200,"06 28, 2011",2011,2162,"['film', 'typical', 'swords', 'sorcery', 'fare', 'centuries', 'start', 'movie', 'conflict', 'king', 'two', 'sons', 'split', 'nation', 'two', 'have', 'been', 'war', 'start', 'movie', 'one', 'nations', 'set', 'be', 'annihilated', 'other', 'desperation', 'king', 'have', 'court', 'sorcerer', 'summon', 'nation', 'old', 'defender', 'Gryphon', 'things', 'however', 'go', 'downhill', 'when', 'sorcerer', 'new', 'pet', 'monster', 'try', 'conquer', 'nations', 'unite', 'rule', 'What', 'fetch', 'quest', 'where', 'prince', 'one', 'nations', 'princess', 'other', 'have', 'join', 'forces', 'try', 'destroy', 'sorcerer.This', 'movie', 'one', 'big', 'fetch', 'quest', 'enough', 'interesting', 'characters', 'plot', 'twists', 'keep', 'fun', 'movie', 'do', 'not', 'stray', 'genre', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'fairly', 'well', 'had', 'allot', 'fun', 'watching', 'movie', 'Now', 'are', 'expecting', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'then', 'will', 'not', 'get', 'here', 'however', 'fun', 'little', 'flick', 'provide', 'hour', 'half', 'entertainment', 'then', 'Attack', 'Gryphon', 'well.My', 'biggest', 'problem', 'movie', 'special', 'effects', 'title', 'character', 'Gryphon', 'straight', 'Playstation', '2', 'game', 'computer', 'graphics', 'really', 'terrible', 'Now', 'usually', 'can', 'be', 'excused', 'as', 'long', 'story', 'good', 'however', 'here', 'CG', 'so', 'horrible', 'really', 'disturbing', 'especially', 'when', 'actors', 'have', 'interact', 'sprite', 'monster', 'scene', 'where', 'sorcerer', 'petting', 'Gryphon', 'beak', 'seriously', 'actor', 'hand', '10', 'cm', 'beak', 'not', 'only', 'have', 'made', 'bag', 'CG', 'creature', 'have', 'integrated', 'film', 'poorly', 'will', 'say', 'however', 'creators', 'movie', 'have', 'been', 'smart', 'enough', 'know', 'limitations', 'Gryphon', 'not', 'many', 'scenes', 'problem', 'bad', 'CG', 'limited.The', 'acting', 'film', 'so', 'so', 'actors', 'overplay', 'allot', 'acting', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'uneven', 'considering', 'type', 'movie', 'are', 'talking', 'can', 'be', 'forgiven', 'Attack', 'Gryphon', 'cheap', 'swords', 'sorcery', 'fantasy', 'flick', 'B', 'movies', 'go', 'rather', 'good']",Attack of the Gryphon

1047862,A2E5HOHZ6CFGZJ,B000MNOX8A,Matthew R. Olson,"[13, 13]","I had wondered what this film was - and I was impressed with it to a small degree. The production is that of a school play, with the strength of the film majorly on the good characters, especially Amber Benson's character.I was rather removed from the idea of the villain and his cronies - Nobody on the opposing side seemed believable, until they tried to thrawt the heroes, usually right in front of  them. The major character of the story, the mystical gryphon, doesn't feel really like it belongs in the film - it's not alive in the scene, it looks like it was animated and composed into the scene without a touch of realism.Condering the production was produced for the SCIFI Channel, the film is low-budget. However, I didn't consider the film ""bad"", but ""cheesy"", and it does deserve some attention. My best advice - Be an Amber fan, that way you won't be offended, and throw twenty dollars down the drain.",4,"A promising film, with a few major weak points..",1182038400,"06 17, 2007",2007,913,"['had', 'wondered', 'what', 'film', 'was', 'was', 'impressed', 'small', 'degree', 'production', 'school', 'play', 'strength', 'film', 'majorly', 'good', 'characters', 'especially', 'Amber', 'Benson', 'character.I', 'was', 'rather', 'removed', 'idea', 'villain', 'cronies', 'Nobody', 'opposing', 'side', 'seemed', 'believable', 'tried', 'thrawt', 'heroes', 'usually', 'right', 'front', 'major', 'character', 'story', 'mystical', 'gryphon', ""n't"", 'feel', 'really', 'film', 'not', 'alive', 'scene', 'was', 'animated', 'composed', 'scene', 'touch', 'realism.Condering', 'production', 'was', 'produced', 'SCIFI', 'Channel', 'film', 'low-budget', 'However', 'did', ""n't"", 'consider', 'film', 'bad', 'cheesy', 'deserve', 'attention', 'best', 'advice', 'Be', 'Amber', 'fan', 'way', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'offended', 'throw', 'twenty', 'dollars', 'drain']",Attack of the Gryphon
