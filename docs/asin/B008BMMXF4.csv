It explains how the human body evolved to store fat because of thousands of years of food scarcity on the planet. And in contrast, it explains that in a food-glutted society such as ours, there is never any famine to balance out all the excess food. Perhaps most importantly of all, the film reveals how the processed food industry purposely infuses its products with sugar, a highly addicting substance, to guarantee that customers will get hooked on their products, no matter how much harm it does to the health of those customers.For those who are inspired by this film to seek additional information on health and nutrition, many of the key persons appearing in this documentary have either written books or created health documentaries of their own, including the following:Jason Vale, known as ""the Juice Master"":Jason Vale 7 Lbs in 7 Days Super Juice Diet.David Wolfe:Superfoods: The Food and Medicine of the Future.Mike Adams:Natural Health Solutions.Joe Cross:Fat, Sick & Nearly Dead.Frank Ferrante, co-author of the book that the documentary is based on:Hungry for Change: Ditch the Diets, Conquer the Cravings, and Eat Your Way to Lifelong Health.Kris Carr:Crazy Sexy Cancer.",5,Amazing film that can change lives,1361923200,"02 27, 2013",2013,2136,"['enthralling', 'informative', 'documentary', 'directed', 'James', 'Colquhoun', 'Laurentine', 'Ten', 'Bosch', 'who', 'previously', 'directed', 'health-related', 'documentary', 'Food', 'Matters.In', 'only', 'hour', 'half', 'film', 'amazing', 'number', 'essential', 'nutritional', 'issues', 'seeking', 'achieve', 'healthier', 'life', 'healthier', 'diet', 'was', 'stunned', 'how', 'much', 'information', 'filmmakers', 'packed', 'such', 'relatively', 'short', 'space', 'time', 'wish', 'secondary', 'student', 'country', 'could', 'view', 'film', 'part', 'required', 'health', 'class', 'addition', 'viewings', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'regularly', 'scheduled', 'health', 'clubs', 'venue', 'where', 'weight', 'loss', 'concern.This', 'documentary', 'interest', 'everyone', 'not', 'just', 'newbies', 'health', 'nutrition', 'good', 'reminder', 're-inspiration', 'even', 'most', 'diehard', 'health', 'nuts', 'One', 'key', 'achievements', 'film', 'remove', 'shame', 'obesity', 'several', 'crucial', 'ways', 'how', 'human', 'body', 'evolved', 'store', 'fat', 'thousands', 'years', 'food', 'scarcity', 'planet', 'contrast', 'food-glutted', 'society', 'such', 'ours', 'never', 'famine', 'balance', 'out', 'excess', 'food', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'importantly', 'film', 'how', 'processed', 'food', 'industry', 'purposely', 'products', 'sugar', 'highly', 'addicting', 'substance', 'guarantee', 'customers', 'will', 'get', 'hooked', 'products', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'harm', 'health', 'customers.For', 'who', 'are', 'inspired', 'film', 'seek', 'additional', 'information', 'health', 'nutrition', 'many', 'key', 'persons', 'appearing', 'documentary', 'have', 'written', 'books', 'created', 'health', 'documentaries', 'own', 'including', 'following', 'Jason', 'Vale', 'known', 'Juice', 'Master', 'Jason', 'Vale', '7', 'Lbs', '7', 'Days', 'Super', 'Juice', 'Diet.David', 'Wolfe', 'Superfoods', 'Food', 'Medicine', 'Future.Mike', 'Adams', 'Natural', 'Health', 'Solutions.Joe', 'Cross', 'Fat', 'Sick', 'Nearly', 'Dead.Frank', 'Ferrante', 'co-author', 'book', 'documentary', 'based', 'Hungry', 'Change', 'Ditch', 'Diets', 'Conquer', 'Cravings', 'Eat', 'Way', 'Lifelong', 'Health.Kris', 'Carr', 'Crazy', 'Sexy', 'Cancer']",Hungry For Change

1549820,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B008BMMXF4,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[54, 57]","The new documentary ""Hungry For Change"" covers a familiar topic, but repackages the information in a nice user-friendly way.  In all honesty, I have now seen about a dozen different films that challenge the status quo and seek to enlighten the masses about the destructive nature of careless eating.  But despite what seems like a patently obvious message, we (as consumers) still choose to look the other way.  As a society, we have branded convenience as more important than health and big business has taken advantage of this decision in some pretty nefarious ways.  But like many, while I realize my faults, I still perpetuate the problem in my own lifestyle.  In truth, ""Hungry for Change"" really doesn't present anything I haven't seen before--but I guess a caustic reminder is appropriate every once in a while!  And if you have never given your food choices much thought, I'd definitely say this is worth a look.There are a lot of topics covered in this brief ninety minute presentation.  For me, the film starts on incredibly strong ground as it deals directly with concerns of diet and nutrition.  The section on dieting is both amusing and disturbing, and the criticisms presented about food manufacturers, distributors, and regulators hit the target mercilessly.  Just the facts about so-called fat-free products should be shown to every household in the world that thinks it's making smarter choices!  Sugar, of course, takes an expected (and warranted) beating by the experts.  We even see Jamie Oliver (flavored milk's biggest opponent) at the 2010 TED conference.  But if you follow this educational movement, you'll recognize many of this movie's participants (it is by the makers of Food Matters).The movie strays a bit from its central themes with discussions on skin products and there's even an endorsement for positive visualization.  It's as if the makers wanted to stuff so much material into the movie, it started to lose a bit of impact for me.  There is also an ongoing, but manufactured, dramatic arc that I found completely unnecessary.  Like a cheesy educational film, we watch a fictional woman at various points throughout the movie as she morphs from a shy frump to a confident woman.  It's a corny bit of filmmaking that detracted from the movie's essential themes.  But still, these are small gripes.  The important message in ""Hungry for Change"" should be seen and heard.  But at 4 stars, I'm judging the movie and not the primary message.  Beyond the movie itself, the DVD boasts almost a couple more hours of additional footage and interviews.

I believe that if you want to see a juicing infomercial or a bunch of pseudoscientists pimping their own products and philosophies, then that is exactly what you'll get. A thinking person will not simply watch this and take all claims as gospel truth and then buy every book every one of these claimants has published; What you should do is hear the claims and then check it out, realizing that the REAL truth about modern versions of food will likely be inaccessible to the average conscious consumer (let me put on my tin foil hat here...) because, as with pharma, and once, tobacco, there is a lot of money and vested interests in keeping consumers in the dark about what they are eating and where it comes from. Certainly a lot more money than some db hawking a juicer...Yes, unfortunately, they chose to weave in these bits with some random representation of the Everywoman and her neuroses about food, etc...Utterly useless padding.A lot of allusions are made to juicing and a vegetarian or vegan lifestyle, but I simply did not see it as being so overt as other reviews have made it out.

The idea of staying away from products that have ingredients that you CAN NOT EVEN PRONOUNCE is valid!

""Better eating through Science"" is not necessarily the best way to eat for anyone's long term health!I have always been (for the most part) a skeptic when it comes to new claims of what is best to eat or what drugs are best to have administered.  My personal skepticism stems from a very early age when I found that I am allergic to one food and then in my twenties finding I have a sensitivity or what can be a serious life threading allergy to medically prescribed drugs.  I approach all medicines with caution as everyone should do.The best policy when approaching eating is to use moderation and common sense and certainly not to believe immediately everything that is written anywhere at anytime about foods or medicines.

1549842,AR2ZNBYLIUYQ6,B008BMMXF4,Timegoesby,"[14, 19]","I have mixed feelings about this film. The beginning seemed promising since the film seemed like it was mostly talking about making healthy food choices, and how this food affects us. I was interested in watching another film concerning the importance of eating whole foods vs. processed, manufactured foods. Towards the middle and end of the film though, the film started to degenerate into some spiel about the importance of juicing, detoxing, self-love, not letting stress get to us, getting enough sleep and how when we are healthier inside, our skin and hair start to glow. Huh?! It was as if the film lost focus and decided to go into a few dozen little directions, really odd.This film seems like a blend of some facts mixed with motivational speakers doling out their upbeat beliefs, with a touch of hocus pocus. None of the films recommendations were really harmful: eat vegetables, more plant-based foods, less fried foods, less sugar, move more, but I really did not find the film to be cohesive in it's message.If you can watch this movie for free somewhere, it might make you feel good for abit (since it's message is saying you can make changes and feel better). But I really don't think this one is good enough to buy.

What's changed in the last 50 years?  This film was a sobering account of how the public is mass manipulated into believing what is healthy for us and what is in truth making us spend more $$$ to eat more(non nutritional foods) and become sicker so we spend more $$$ in search of a cure.  Let's put it this way, corporate greed is killing us, and this film explores the food side of it.  While the film became tedious in areas the message (albeit one that has been talked about over and over) is essential for anyone who really wants to be ""healthy"".This film explores the side of the food industry that is doing to us what the tobacco industry did to us in the 50's and 60's, making eating glamorous while lacing nutritionally empty franken-foods with chemicals that keep you hungry and addicted to them while your body is actually starving for nutrition and getting fat and sick in the process.  It also gave me a shock when they stated that infant cord blood testing revealed our babies are born with over 200 man made chemicals in them.  And you wonder why the autism numbers and food allergies are high now...Jamie Oliver has a bigger issue than our kids school lunches keeping them healthy, he should go after pregnant mothers lunches before they become pregnant!So, once the food companies make more and more money off of us while we get sicker and sicker, guess who's next in line to collect the rest of your money?  The mighty pharmaceutical companies!  We have become nothing but a planet of worker bees supporting a mass complex of corporate bottom lines.  Time to educate ourselves and our kids and stop the mad merry go round I would think.Realize Monsanto is the devil and Cargill and Bayer are the minions.Here's the scoop on this documentary; try to buy fresh local foods, forget the convenience and pre prepared foods, and try to cook like mom did using basic whole foods.  If it's already in a jar or bag ready to eat question what's actually in the package.  Additives in that package can trick you brain into hunger and processed foods are like processed drugs...dangerous.  My favorite example is the coca leaf...make a tea out of the leaf it's a very safe non addictive tea...process it like you would corn into high fructose corn syrup, it becomes cocaine.  Get it?
