700022,A2KZQY1VW9JDWV,B000065U2U,Absolem,"[1, 3]","....But his ""mate"" was.If you're even reading this review you've probably figured out that Stranded is loosely based on The Swiss Family Robinson and is about a family that ends up shipwrecked, etc.The film starts with the father (Liam Cunningham) of the family getting shipped off to a penal colony for being in lay-mens terms, a Bible thumper, and dragging his family along with him. His wife Lara (Brana Bajic), his three sons Fritz (Jesse Spencer), Ernst (Neil Newbon), and Jacob (Charlie Lucas and Andrew Lee Potts), and his daughter Sarah (Bonnie Wright and Emma Pierson). Cue the storm battering the hell out of the ship, and a slightly shorter haired Thomas Blunt (Roger Allam) in a stiff uniform (which he admits to hating during the last few minutes of the movie - I don't necessarily blame him) making an appearance to, among other things, make everyone incredibly uncomfortable. It could be the fact that he's hitting on the pastors wife, or it could be that he demands the head Robinson to be lashed for giving the other prisoners false hope through the concept of religion. Or something like that.A storm erupts, the ships captain takes a mast to the skull, a hole is busted through the deck and to the hold, and Thomas Blunt decides to play captain (what with the other one being 100% dead and all) and declares it time to abandon ship, which suits everyone just fine except for little Sarah, who has chosen to get stuck under a bit of wreckage in the hold. The majority of her family comes down to rescue her, but Jacob gets separated, ending up in a lifeboat with a myriad of passengers and sailors, including Blunt, and Blunts worse half, his mate, a stringy, sticky looking fellow that responds without question to the name ""Pickles"".The first hour and half of the film is devoted partially to the Robinsons discovering the island, despairing over their situation, fighting, whining, getting bit by things, and typically making any watcher yearn for the other party of Jacob and Co. Conniving and godless they may be (though this may be disputable as the eventual pirates do seem to worship themselves quite often), at least they aren't weak. The dirty sailors (as they aren't quite at pirate status at this point of the film) and a few straggling passengers are eventually rescued, then taken along on a voyage that serves the captain of this ship quite well, but nobody else seems to profit from his extracurricular dealings. In between becoming something of a surrogate father for Jacob and eyerolling at Pickles' lewd and poorly thought out ideas for monetary gain, Blunt disposes of this captain, and again places himself as first in command.The second hour and a half is a bit faster, louder, with more rope swinging and near throat-cutting and gunfights and dying. The sailors are now apparently pirates, though there is a distinct lack of peg-legs, eye patches, and hats. Again there is a bond between Blunt and Jacob that appears stronger than any bond Jacob might've had with his biological father, and both seem to benefit from it. There's a prisoner of course, the daughter of a captain that gets a good smack in the head and locked in a cupboard (which is better than the rest of his crew fared), because Blunt and his merry men have developed a fetish for all things shiny, though in doing so attracted the attention of the Navy. There is also a shaky love triangle around the 2 hour mark, a reunion half an hour later, and a bit of an unjustified death another half hour.The characters are well acted, though I worry I found myself hating the supposed good guys for being over-reactive, harsh, hypocritical, and too relying on prayers to save them; and too admiring of the bad guys. David and Lara Robinson are a bit irritating, and my god do they know how to be dramatic - though I guess on a deserted island dignity doesn't matter much. The two older boys are entertaining, one a challenger of his father and one completely unaware as long as he can have his books. Blunt is amusing and fascinating in a twisted sort of way, the kind of wolf that would rather play with his food just for fun than eat it, and obviously not good, but not a mass murderer or a malicious psychopath, though the only evidence there is of this is his attachment to Jacob and his unwillingness to engage in quite as much torture as his resident dimwit, Pickles.Good movie, a bit slow in parts, but vastly entertaining if you like adventure/survival movies and anything to do with the ocean and ships....I'm not too keen on the Navy's uniform either.",5,That one time we watched a

Now I am always willing to see a different take on a book. This version of Swiss Family Robinson is more closely related than some others. I went into this with an open mind and my wife watched as well. Both our conclusions were we probably wouldn't sit through it again. It is okay, but it is far to slow in developing the story. This should have had tighter editing. It does not need to be so long a movie, and some of the scenes were not well acted. The music isn't that great either. I know now why someone like Hallmark didn't pick this one to distribute. Overall I am disappointed so many rated this so well. I think this movie had good potential, but it wasn't realized during editing. The scripting is pretty good and I like the addition of the native that comes to the Island.

Sometimes things work out for the worse, but this time I was pleasantly surprised with the 180 minute version. I had to get that out because it allowed a lot of sub-plots that I can imagine were cut. We get to see how the Robinsons learned to subsist, as well as how the one son got along, being away from the family for all of those years. In fact, these were not just brief moments of showing what was going on in the son's life, but there were whole new plots involved that made this a very fulfilling movie and well worth the time invested. I could not name one of the actors in the movie. I did note someone named Liam. I could reach ten inches from here and grab the info, but the names would still mean little to me.

But then before I knew it, I was completely drawn into the film and didn't want to stop to watch the second half tomorrow as I planned-- I had to see what came next.  This was an interesting take on a great story, the acting was great, and the plot kept on moving.  This was no goofy family film, but not some violent movie by any means.  I'd think this would be a PG movie had it been rated, but maybe 9+ would start enjoying it more... but I always recommend pre-viewing a movie first before showing the children because a parent is the best judge for his/her child.Right now I am glad I decided to check out family films for down the road, because it's introducing me to films like this that I would have loved to see even if I had no kids!And... so many people in this film were gorgous yet had interesting looks.  The three sons, very very hot.  The mother was breathtaking, and the young blond girls were stunning.

The actors are superb and the film is long enough to do the story justice--175 minutes. It is great family entertainment and will hold the attention of young and old alike.

I was intrigued to find out how Liam Cunningham fared in this role after watching Falling For a Dancer and Dog Soldiers.  I really enjoy his acting.His wife, two older sons and a daughter land on the island with him.  He being bound for the convict island of Australia.A younger son, Jacob, had been put on a small boat escaping the wrecking of the ship.  He is not reunited with his family for 7 years.The one son is always going against his father's decisions if he makes better sense of his own instincts.  But the boys seem to work well with each other.Oh yes, there is an involuntary drop-off of another female to confuse the issue.  And daddy is hot on her trail.  Well, the trail of the pirates anyway.Then they meet a native [great body] and he helps them and also helps save Laura?  And becomes a saving factor in the end.The pirate Captian is a scoundrel and always putting the moves on Robinson's wife.  He also turns Jake, the Robinson's son into a pirate.Those pirates provide plenty of action - not necessarily good.The rescue and resolution was all that was hoped for.The actors were excellent - the scenery was spectacular - the story a classic - and definitely a credit to the Hallmark trademarkHIGHLY RECOMMENDED - great family movie -- tons of color - [grin, lots of water]",5,OH DEAR - I MUST HAVE SEEN A BETTER MOVIE THAN MOST,1110067200,"03 6, 2005",2005,1367,"['story', 'Robinson', 'family', 'shipwrecked', 'island', '[', 'not', 'Mars', ']', 'was', 'intrigued', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'Liam', 'Cunningham', 'fared', 'role', 'watching', 'Falling', 'Dancer', 'Dog', 'Soldiers', 'really', 'enjoy', 'acting.His', 'wife', 'two', 'older', 'sons', 'daughter', 'land', 'island', 'being', 'bound', 'convict', 'island', 'Australia.A', 'younger', 'son', 'Jacob', 'had', 'been', 'put', 'small', 'boat', 'escaping', 'wrecking', 'ship', 'not', 'reunited', 'family', '7', 'one', 'son', 'always', 'going', 'father', 'decisions', 'better', 'sense', 'own', 'instincts', 'boys', 'seem', 'work', 'well', 'other.Oh', 'yes', 'involuntary', 'drop-off', 'female', 'confuse', 'issue', 'daddy', 'hot', 'trail', 'Well', 'trail', 'pirates', 'anyway.Then', 'meet', 'native', '[', 'great', 'body', ']', 'also', 'save', 'Laura', 'saving', 'factor', 'end.The', 'pirate', 'Captian', 'scoundrel', 'always', 'putting', 'moves', 'Robinson', 'wife', 'also', 'Jake', 'Robinson', 'son', 'pirate.Those', 'pirates', 'provide', 'plenty', 'action', 'not', 'necessarily', 'good.The', 'rescue', 'resolution', 'was', 'was', 'hoped', 'for.The', 'actors', 'were', 'excellent', 'scenery', 'was', 'spectacular', 'story', 'classic', 'definitely', 'credit', 'Hallmark', 'trademarkHIGHLY', 'RECOMMENDED', 'great', 'family', 'movie', 'tons', 'color', '[', 'grin', 'lots', 'water', ']']",Stranded

I agree that i am going to get the dvd.  This a beautiful telling of a classic story.  A bit off from the earlier Disney version.  This family leaves to follow their father;  who is  banished for his religious convictions to not join the army.I could not take my eyes off it.  The amazing family making the best of a possibly  horrible future  exiled on a deserted island; a lost son; and if found several years in prison.  The actors were outstanding.  The locale made me wish i was stranded there.  Gorgeous men, amazing locale, wonderful story of people of faith making a life together.i think the one message that comes from this movie for families  watching this movie is that with faith in each other; tolerance and love that it doesnt matter where you live as long as you are together. Despite disagreements, the children respected their parents; honored them and in the end it made them an even more cohesive family unit.A wonderful action, adventure movie for a great night for the family.  There is something in it for everyone.
