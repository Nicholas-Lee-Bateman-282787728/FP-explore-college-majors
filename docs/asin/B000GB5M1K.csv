The only negative is that ""Murder is Easy"" is not a Miss Marple mystery and doesn't really star Helen Hayes--her role is only a cameo. The real stars of that one are Olivia de Havilland and Bill Bixby. The other two are Miss Marple mysteries and do star Helen Hayes as Miss Marple.

Menta, Jr.","[2, 4]","Of the three television movies featured in this set, I've only seen ""Murder With Mirrors"" (via a DVD rental service), and I felt it was pleasantly watchable.  Positives are a genuinely clever mystery and lots of notable actors, including Helen Hayes and Bette Davis.  Not-so-positive aspects include generally bland photography and direction and a too-cute musical score that regularly seeks to remind us that- fiery deaths and other unpleasant ends notwithstanding- we shouldn't take the murders all that seriously and should just enjoy the puzzle at hand.  I'm guessing that the other two movies in this set don't deviate too far from my description of this one.Of the two acting greats mentioned above, Helen Hayes does most of the heavy lifting and carries ""Murder With Mirrors"" almost single-handedly (though I also enjoyed the feisty redhead who chased men and drove too fast).  Ms. Davis, alas, is trotted out every fifteen minutes or so and capably delivers a few lines, though one gets the feeling that she was there for little else than to up the pedigree of the production.  Thankfully, Ms. Davis' later performance in the theatrical film ""The Whales of August"" demonstrated that she still had the acting chops to handle long sequences and complicated characterization.""Murder With Mirrors"" features a clean, full-screen TV image and there are no extras.
