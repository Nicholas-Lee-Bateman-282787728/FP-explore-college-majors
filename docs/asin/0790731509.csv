He puts on a fantastic performance here.  Basically the standard rebel film except  Newman doesn't act without a cause.  Put into jail for a seemingly minor  violation now, the system he encounters grates against his nature.  You  watch as the system wears him down and he wears the system down.  In the  end it is a kind of stalemate where both win and both lose.  George  Kennedy, who I admit seems like more of a comedy side from the movies I've  seen, is just unbelievable.  It is a shame he hasn't played more dramatic  roles.

96660,AGEIT17HENDIS,0790731509,Alfred Johnson,"[3, 3]","I hope, even when we have a much more equitable society than we do now, we still have ""free spirits"" like Cool Hand Luke (played, and played well with just enough 1960s sneer and `devil take the hinter post' bravado by the late Paul Newman). No, not the hard- scrabble, mad mother-loved, growing up kid part, not the wise, too wise, before his age part that made him cynical, not the world-weary and world- wary before his time part but the crafty, fidgety, authority can go to hell part. That is a trait, as this film makes abundantly clear, no well-valued in current bourgeois society interested as it in the well-oiled machine, and a sullen by-the-numbers mass of humanity.Of course, as the story line here unfolds, ""free spirit""-types take more than their share of beatings in life, and no where is that more true than in a prison. And given old Luke's brand of free spirit (and edginess) he was bound to wind up in prison, sooner or later, no matter how ""street smart"" he was, or brave in military service. However, nothing in his resume would make one think that even in prison, a notorious Southern work camp prison to boot, that old Luke would knuckle under. Something has to give. Throw in a sadistic warden (played by Strother Martin of the famous line used in the headline to this entry), some love/hate camaraderie with fellow inmates, especially ""big lug"" Oscar-winner George Kennedy and you have a volatile mix. Old Luke will keep running that rock up the mountain but you know in your bones, deep in your bones, that rock is coming back down one more time than it is going up. And right over him. Yet Luke still keeps doing it.

96663,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0790731509,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","One of Paul Newman's best performances, and truly one of his best films (I still don't know why I didn't nominate this in Best Picture for my personal awards); `Cool Hand Luke' is not only very, very cool; it is very, very impressive.  With powerful acting and one of the most poignant and powerfully moving endings of it's time, `Cool Hand Luke' is not just a staple for avid Newman fans, but this is a film for anyone who loves film; period.Paul Newman plays Luke, a rebellious young man doing some time for vandalism.  He's strong willed and very independent, qualities that don't mesh well with prison life.  He knocks heads with a few people, not the least of which is the Captain (a ruthless Strother Martin) and Dragline (Oscar winner George Kennedy).  Dragline and Captain are determined to break Luke, but for different reasons and in different ways.  Dragline, the prisons gang leader, wants to break Luke into submission, but soon he begins to admire Luke's unwavering pride.  The Captain wants to humiliate and destroy Luke (that midnight digging scene sends chills down my spine EVERY time I watch this movie).The films ending is really where the heart of the film lies, and where the characters that have been being developed become full and real and most impressionable.  I won't even get into the ending (I am not going to ruin this for anyone) but just know that Luke's final decision rings so true, even today.It's a pure and brutally honest depiction of our subconscious yearnings.The acting is a huge highlight here, and Paul Newman further cements himself as one of the finest actors to ever work in Hollywood (I've been known to confess him as my favorite actor of all time).  What he does with Luke is marvelous; constructing a man who is self inflicted with feelings he refuses to share, reserving himself until the end when his true afflictions are made bare.  Newman creates a perfect faade for Luke, a faux sense of security, which only adds to his eventual breakdown.  George Kennedy was amazing as Dragline, a truly inspired performance.  He's witty when needed, gruff when needed and even charming (he is the true definition of `buddy' here).  A lot of people have knocked his Oscar win in the years that followed it, but he was truly deserving (even if I would have given the award to Hackman).  I also want to point out Strother Martin for his devilish performance, truly spine chilling.So, like I said, this is a marvelous film and is one that I highly recommend to any and everyone I talk to.  I'm so glad my father ranted and raved about this long enough for me to finally commit to watching it (that Paul Newman TCM marathon didn't help either) and so, in like manner, I plan on ranting and raving this film until you see it too!",5,"One of the best, by one of the best...",1239148800,"04 8, 2009",2009,2765,"['One', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'best', 'performances', 'truly', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'nominate', 'Best', 'Picture', 'personal', 'awards', 'Cool', 'Hand', 'Luke', 'not', 'only', 'very', 'very', 'cool', 'very', 'very', 'impressive', 'powerful', 'acting', 'one', 'most', 'poignant', 'powerfully', 'moving', 'endings', 'time', 'Cool', 'Hand', 'Luke', 'not', 'just', 'staple', 'avid', 'Newman', 'fans', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'film', 'Newman', 'Luke', 'rebellious', 'young', 'man', 'doing', 'time', 'vandalism', 'strong', 'willed', 'very', 'independent', 'qualities', 'do', ""n't"", 'mesh', 'well', 'prison', 'life', 'heads', 'few', 'people', 'not', 'least', 'Captain', 'ruthless', 'Strother', 'Martin', 'Dragline', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'George', 'Kennedy', 'Dragline', 'Captain', 'are', 'determined', 'break', 'Luke', 'different', 'reasons', 'different', 'ways', 'Dragline', 'prisons', 'gang', 'leader', 'break', 'Luke', 'submission', 'soon', 'admire', 'Luke', 'unwavering', 'pride', 'Captain', 'humiliate', 'destroy', 'Luke', 'midnight', 'digging', 'scene', 'down', 'spine', 'EVERY', 'time', 'watch', 'movie', 'films', 'ending', 'really', 'where', 'heart', 'film', 'where', 'characters', 'have', 'been', 'being', 'developed', 'become', 'full', 'real', 'most', 'impressionable', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'ending', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'ruin', 'anyone', 'just', 'know', 'Luke', 'final', 'decision', 'rings', 'so', 'true', 'even', 'pure', 'brutally', 'honest', 'depiction', 'subconscious', 'yearnings.The', 'acting', 'huge', 'highlight', 'here', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'further', 'cements', 'one', 'finest', 'actors', 'ever', 'work', 'Hollywood', ""'ve"", 'been', 'known', 'confess', 'favorite', 'actor', 'time', 'What', 'Luke', 'marvelous', 'constructing', 'man', 'who', 'self', 'inflicted', 'feelings', 'share', 'reserving', 'end', 'when', 'true', 'afflictions', 'are', 'made', 'bare', 'Newman', 'perfect', 'faade', 'Luke', 'faux', 'sense', 'security', 'only', 'eventual', 'breakdown', 'George', 'Kennedy', 'was', 'amazing', 'Dragline', 'truly', 'inspired', 'performance', 'witty', 'when', 'needed', 'gruff', 'when', 'needed', 'even', 'charming', 'true', 'definition', 'buddy', 'here', 'lot', 'people', 'have', 'knocked', 'Oscar', 'win', 'years', 'followed', 'was', 'truly', 'deserving', 'even', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'award', 'Hackman', 'also', 'want', 'point', 'out', 'Strother', 'Martin', 'devilish', 'performance', 'truly', 'spine', 'chilling.So', 'said', 'marvelous', 'film', 'one', 'highly', 'recommend', 'everyone', 'talk', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'father', 'ranted', 'raved', 'long', 'enough', 'finally', 'commit', 'watching', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'TCM', 'marathon', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'either', 'so', 'like', 'manner', 'plan', 'ranting', 'raving', 'film', 'see', 'too']",N/A

96667,A1PASRZ81DY9C,0790731509,Austin Somlo,"[3, 14]","Viewed: 4/06Rate: 74/06: Cool Hand Luke had the making of a real classic but fell short. Overall, I wasn't drawn into the picture. The same year as Cool Hand Luke, Bonnie and Clyde was made. There was a sharp difference in both films. Bonnie and Clyde was about drawing me into the characters while I couldn't care less about anybody in Cool Hand Luke. It was like watching a person who chooses to piss his life away for no reason whatsoever. So, Cool Hand Luke became an mindless entertainment that ended predictably. I was not inclined to favor George Kennedy for his Oscar win as the Best Supporting Actor. It was just nothing. Anyway, I loved the story, the prison life, and the subplots including the tanned woman and the 50 eggs contest. After the couple of escapes, Cool Hand Luke lost its momentum and became a dull film to the end. Another fault of Cool Hand Luke was that it's too long. I can easily think of greater classic films in the same genre such as ever-lastingly awesome Papillon, The Great Escape, and The Shawshank Redemption. Cool Hand Luke didn't cut the cake for me. Steve McQueen of Papillon outperformed Paul Newman easily. So did Dustin Hoffman over George Kennedy. The ending wasn't moving either. Good riddance.

96676,A141HP4LYPWMSR,0790731509,Brian E. Erland,"[10, 11]","Released in '69, 'Cool Hand Luke' is in my opinion Paul Newman's signature film and one of the great classic films of all-time. Everything worked together perfectly in this movie; A marvelous directing job by Stuart Rosenberg, terrific contemporary soundtrack by Lalo Schifrin and and ensemble cast to die for. There are so many well known faces in this film and so many great, quotable lines you'll never forget.Newman plays the recently incarcerated Luke. Assigned to a chain gang to serve out a relatively short sentence for cutting the heads off parking meters, his non conformist ways earn the respect of the other inmates and the hatred of the guards and captain.What makes 'Cool Hand Luke' so memorable is the fact that it's a story within a story. On the one hand you have a mundane prison tale of a group of societal misfits serving time for their various indisgressions. However on a deeper level you have a Messianic parody with Luke as the Christ. As the inmates embrace him as their ""Chosen One"" the guards seek to destroy him for disturbing the established order. A great film on so many levels. For those who like to read into the story, or for those who are just looking for a little entertainment.George Kennedy received a well deserved Oscar for his supporting role, but it really should have won many more. Newman is magnificent and Martin Strother once again proves himself to be one of the greatest character actors of his generation.

96684,AGHJ9BMVMGIOL,0790731509,colinwoodward,"[3, 3]","This, the story of a Southern chain gang in the post-WWII South, is one of my top ten favorite movies. Growing up, it had legendary status in my household. My dad, my brother, and I quoted from it all the time. Even today, I can break into a Strother Martin impersonation (""When a man's mother dies...."") that gets my dad laughing. Simply put, this is just about a perfect movie. It contains the classic eating of 50 eggs scene (where, if you didn't get the Jesus symbolism by then, is made pretty obvious). But the car washing scene is pretty classic, too (even if the woman looks more ""60s"" than the rest of the movie). The script is fantastic, the locations are evocative of the time and place, and the actors all put in great performances. George Kennedy won an Oscar for his turn as the prison fixture, Dragline; and unfortunately, they don't make them like Strother Martin (dead) and Harry Dean Stanton (still acting) anymore. The cast is so good that Joe Don Baker and Dennis Hopper appear, though only on the margins. And as for this movie's star, well, Paul Newman gives his best performance as Luke, who epitomizes the American rebel. Think James Dean goes to prison and you have Cool Hand Luke. It's hard to believe Newman was around 40 when he made this movie. He looks a lot younger. The book the movie is based on was written by an ex-con safecracker, who had served time on a chain gang. The movie certainly has authenticity (even though it was filmed in Stockton, California, not the Deep South).

It is anti-authoritarian without being strident, a serious drama with whimsy, gritty and violent with a sexy side (who can forget the car wash scene?).  Newman plays the ""christ"" figure and his prisoners as his disciples and believers (after he wins them over).  The guards and the warden are the high priests and the Romans.  And of course, they kill him in the end.But we have some great fun along the way.  Luke strips the heads off of a street of parking meters and gets a sentence far out of proportion to such a silly crime.  To say that Luke chooses not to fit in is an understatement.  It isn't that he takes on the system. Rather, his mere presence and indifference to the system causes it to change or to try and eliminate him as if he were some invading virus.There are some wonderful and indelible scenes such as the egg eating, the fight with Dragline (George Kennedy), the race to the end of the road, the failure to communicate scene and the severe punishment Luke receives.  It seems like you can sit around talking about scenes from this movie longer than the movie itself.Paul Newman made Luke immortal, but George Kennedy as Dragline and Strother Martin as Captain are also essential to this movie's character and permanence.Today's viewers might fine the pacing of the movie a bit slow and see some seams that those of us who love it might ignore, but so what?

96691,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,0790731509,David Baldwin,"[1, 2]","I don't view ""Cool Hand Luke"" as an indictment of our penal system.  Rather, it's an allegory about senseless systemic control over a compliant underclass.  Most of the prisoners in the work prison are there for such minor offenses such as passing bad checks or in the case of Luke(Paul Newman) destroying parking meters while in a drunken state. The keepers at the prison resort their charges to demeaning degradation like having them ask permission to swat a fly otherwise it's a night in the sweatbox.  Along comes Luke to flaunt the authority and become a folk hero to the other inmates.  However, once his mother passes Luke's anti-authoritarian streak developes a purpose and the system becomes more sadistic to set an example to the other inmates about crossing the line.

I think the thing that appeals most of all to me is the unbelievable authenticity of all the characters. Except for Newman (because, hey, he's Paul Newman) nobody here appears to be acting. The guards are done just right--tough, good ol' boys who you don't wanna mess with. The prisoners meanwhile are a fairly diverse lot, some educated, some not, some with a whiff of femininity, but all have a refusal to be stripped of their dignity. Luke magnifies that element to the Nth degree.The second best thing is the dialogue: Like ""The Godfather"", ""Star Trek II"", ""Resoirovir Dogs"", and ""Jaws"", Cool Hand Luke has several scenes which you'll easily memorize in their entirety.Other elements: Boss Godfrey, The Man With No Eyes who doesn't say one word during the movie and who is one of the most chilling characters in a movie ever; Luke's mother, the car wash girl, the egg-eating contest, and Luke's excellent final monologue.Luke's story has been compared to that of Jesus. When you look at it, you see that if Luke is a savior, he's a terribly flawed one, one who can't save himself. He's anti-authority, he's got nerve, and some major cojones, but he's got no aims, no goals, no beliefs. He's a Rebel Without A Clue. If he'd been born about 15-20 years later he could have made a good hippie. But this is still the early '50s and men who fail to conform end up exactly where he does. IMHO, this film accomplishes what One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest tried to do and does it much, much, better.One final small note: The Lalo Schifrin score is great particularly during the ""tarring the road"" scene.

The late Paul Newman, who died just this last Friday, the 26 of September, lived and died like his character, Luke, in defiance but always smiling.  His defiance was in what people had pegged him for--the handsome movie star with beautiful blue eyes with a classical face.  Instead he channeled  this defiance into helping other less fortunate people than he was---the terminally ill children (the Hole in the Wall), relief funds for the people in the Gulf, various charities, etc.  Also he lived away from Hollywood, in Connecticut where he and his family were just folks. But another reason I've seen this movie countless times is because it was shot near my hometown of Stockton, California---those crossroads in the film sure remind of the Valley.

Playing an easy-going, aimless rebel, Newman brings his character to uber believability without even saying a word; just a grin, a smirk, a wink--and he has the audience in the palm of his hand.Yes, this is a prison flick, yet it's unique in that the setting is a rural prison in the Deep South that is stark and brutal and the inmates labor under a sweltering sun as a chain gang, their images reflected in the sunglasses of a rifle-toting, silent head guard.  The film is all at once humorous, compelling, menacing, and poignant; it's an anti-establishment film (there were several made during this period) where we as the audience root for the rebel--even though we know Authority is eventually going to take him down.  Playing ""Cool Hand"" Luke, Newman is completely likeable as he meanders through his role and bucks ""the system""; he's ultimately going to lose, which points to the inevitable pathos of the story.Newman is supported by a topnotch cast, led by a grinning, good ol' boy George Kennedy as his enthusiastic sidekick.

Not only is Newman spectacular here, but the rest of the cast pull it off nicely. George Kennedy gives an unforgettable performance as Dragline, who slowly supports Luke during the film. Strother Martin is compelling, even humorous, as the Captain. He is the one who says ""What we have here is . . . failure to communicate.""

Or, the woman washing her car with suds all over her breasts and DragLine's (G. Kennedy) great quote: &quot;Anyone with a face so sweet... and a body like that MUST be named Lucille&quot;! Unlike another reviewer, I was pleased to see a film about life in prison that did not include a rape scene.The notion of a rebel against authority (remember, though, that Luke was not too much of a rebel, because he won a Silver Star in the war) is one that resonates with lots of folks (and not just yuppies or baby boomers). How can one not identify with Newman, who is less than enthused about a &quot;lot of guys, spouting off a bunch of rules and regulations&quot;. ANYONE who ever wanted to say to a boss &quot;just because its your job don't make it right&quot; ought to be able to identify with Luke on some level.But like many great films (among which I count this one), its a simple film.

Nothing wrong with that, and like a slow lazy day, this film it can be enjoyed over and over again, and comes around far too infrequently.

He has had so many spectacularly great roles and performances to his credit that it's hard to choose just one.  And one of his best has to have been COOL HAND LUKE, that classic 1967 prison drama that was one of the defining films of that turbulent time and helped cement Newman's reputation.Based on the book of the same name by ex-con Don Pierson, who co-wrote the script with Frank Pierson and who has a cameo role here as a prisoner, the film stars Newman as an out-of-work drunk who is arrested in a small southern town for ""maliciously destroyin' municipal property while under the influence""--in other words, taking the heads off of dozens of parking meters.  This lands him a two-year sentence on a brutal chain gang, whose leader, named Dragline (George Kennedy, in an Oscar-winning performance), takes an almost instant dislike to him until he engages Newman in a boxing match in which Newman's Luke doesn't quit even when he's down.Newman gains the respect of his fellow prisoners for his ""don't give a damn"" attitude; but he soon raises the ire of the prison guards, especially after his escape attempts.  After the first one, the head prison chief known as the Captain, played by Strother Martin, upbraids him with the line etched into Hollywood immortality: ""What we've got here is...failure to communicate.""Just about the finest prison genre movie there has ever been, COOL HAND LUKE is directed in sterling fasion by Stuart Rosenberg, and features a perfect Americana score by Lalo Schifrin.  Alongside Newman and Kennedy are such future stars and character actors as Dennis Hopper, Ralph Waite, Harry Dean Stanton, Luke Askew, J.D. Cannon, Robert Donner, and Wayne Rogers.  Filmed almost completely on location in Stockton, California, and featuring many memorable scenes, including the famous egg-eating contest in which Newman consumes fifty eggs in 60 minutes, COOL HAND LUKE has lost none of its power in the thirty-seven years since its release, and is vigorously recommended, particularly alongside similar and more recent outings like THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION and DEAD MAN WALKING.",5,Good For A Five-Spot,1104451200,"12 31, 2004",2004,2155,"['Paul', 'Newman', 'not', 'acting', 'legend', 'nothing', 'had', 'so', 'many', 'spectacularly', 'great', 'roles', 'performances', 'credit', 'hard', 'choose', 'just', 'one', 'one', 'best', 'have', 'been', 'COOL', 'HAND', 'LUKE', 'classic', '1967', 'prison', 'drama', 'was', 'one', 'defining', 'films', 'turbulent', 'time', 'helped', 'cement', 'Newman', 'reputation.Based', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'ex-con', 'Don', 'Pierson', 'who', 'co-wrote', 'script', 'Frank', 'Pierson', 'who', 'cameo', 'role', 'here', 'prisoner', 'film', 'Newman', 'out-of-work', 'drunk', 'who', 'arrested', 'small', 'southern', 'town', 'maliciously', 'destroyin', 'municipal', 'property', 'influence', 'other', 'words', 'taking', 'heads', 'dozens', 'parking', 'meters', 'two-year', 'sentence', 'brutal', 'chain', 'gang', 'leader', 'named', 'Dragline', 'George', 'Kennedy', 'Oscar-winning', 'performance', 'almost', 'instant', 'dislike', 'Newman', 'boxing', 'match', 'Newman', 'Luke', ""n't"", 'quit', 'even', 'when', 'down.Newman', 'gains', 'respect', 'fellow', 'prisoners', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'damn', 'attitude', 'soon', 'ire', 'prison', 'guards', 'especially', 'escape', 'attempts', 'first', 'one', 'head', 'prison', 'chief', 'known', 'Captain', 'played', 'Strother', 'Martin', 'line', 'etched', 'Hollywood', 'immortality', 'What', ""'ve"", 'got', 'here', 'failure', 'communicate', 'Just', 'finest', 'prison', 'genre', 'movie', 'there', 'ever', 'been', 'COOL', 'HAND', 'LUKE', 'directed', 'sterling', 'fasion', 'Stuart', 'Rosenberg', 'perfect', 'Americana', 'score', 'Lalo', 'Schifrin', 'Alongside', 'Newman', 'Kennedy', 'are', 'such', 'future', 'stars', 'character', 'actors', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'Ralph', 'Waite', 'Harry', 'Dean', 'Stanton', 'Luke', 'Askew', 'J.D', 'Cannon', 'Robert', 'Donner', 'Wayne', 'Rogers', 'Filmed', 'almost', 'completely', 'location', 'Stockton', 'California', 'featuring', 'many', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'including', 'famous', 'egg-eating', 'contest', 'Newman', 'fifty', 'eggs', '60', 'minutes', 'COOL', 'HAND', 'LUKE', 'lost', 'none', 'power', 'thirty-seven', 'years', 'release', 'vigorously', 'recommended', 'particularly', 'alongside', 'similar', 'more', 'recent', 'outings', 'THE', 'SHAWSHANK', 'REDEMPTION', 'DEAD', 'MAN', 'WALKING']",N/A

Of course, he runs into problems with the law and gets thrown into the slammer for vandalism. That's only the beginning of a long and complicated downhill run.It's a rather depressing movie with a couple very funny and uplifting parts that are so good it makes watching the whole movie very worthwhile. One is the spot when the working prison gang passes by a scantly clad young lady washing a car and doing everything possible to attract the attention of the workers. Funny? Just amazing! A second very funny scene is where Luke claims that he can eat 50 eggs and then carries out the boast in an increasingly agonizing fashion. These two scenes save what might have been a rather dreary movie and turn it into a classic.The sound and photography are excellent.

One of the defining roles in Paul Newman's career in which he plays a likable convict put in prison for breaking into parking meters. Luke is a nonconformist which doesn't bode well for him in prison, a place that demands conformity to the rules. Luke evolves into a position of respect among the inmates, they look upon him as a leader though it's a role he doesn't want. He's constantly bucking the system which keeps him in trouble with the warden & guards. Things get worse after a successful escape & subsequent recapture. The warden & guards try to break Luke's spirit which they aren't very successful at. Luke finally tries another escape which leads to his demise.The movie has several defining moments in it; there's the egg eating scene where Luke eats fifty boiled eggs in one hour, there's the scene where the warden (Strother Martin) makes his famous speech: ""What we have here... is a failure to communicate..."" & the scene where, apparently, Luke's spirit is broken. The acting in this movie is outstanding elicited by the director Stuart Rosenberg who wasn't & never will be one of Hollywood's better known directors.There are many now famous actors in this movie with varying degrees of substantial roles.

Although George Kennedy won a much deserved Oscar for his role as Dragline, Paul Newman should have gotten one as well for he is as good in this film as any he has made. The critics I believe have underestimated his acting ability, probably in part because of his good looks. No one with eyes that blue can act too. Newman is cast here as the noncomformist Lucas Jackson who gets sent to prison for destroying parking meters while on a drinking rampage. Newman's egg-swallowing scene has become a classic, and the phrase ""what we're got here here is a failure to communicate"" has become part of our language. Newman really does a fine acting job here, even when he sings ""I don't care if it rains or freezes/As long as I've got my plastic Jesus,"" having just learned of the death of his mother.My one complaint about the film is no fault of Newman's. The religious overtones get a little heavy-handed. For example, there is one frame where Luke is lying wearing only his shorts with his arms stretched out and one foot over the other in a classic crucifixion pose. Then there is the scene where he runs into a deserted church complete with a wooden cross on top of it and laments his fate in a loud voice.This film is still very entertaining and much worth your viewing time.",5,The Movie Holds Up Well,1125446400,"08 31, 2005",2005,1328,"['1967', 'movie', 'up', 'well', 'years', 'George', 'Kennedy', 'won', 'much', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'role', 'Dragline', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'should', 'have', 'gotten', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'as', 'good', 'film', 'made', 'critics', 'believe', 'have', 'underestimated', 'acting', 'ability', 'probably', 'part', 'good', 'looks', 'one', 'eyes', 'blue', 'can', 'act', 'too', 'Newman', 'cast', 'here', 'noncomformist', 'Lucas', 'Jackson', 'who', 'sent', 'prison', 'destroying', 'parking', 'meters', 'drinking', 'rampage', 'Newman', 'egg-swallowing', 'scene', 'become', 'classic', 'phrase', 'what', ""'re"", 'got', 'here', 'here', 'failure', 'communicate', 'become', 'part', 'language', 'Newman', 'really', 'fine', 'acting', 'job', 'here', 'even', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'freezes/As', 'long', ""'ve"", 'got', 'plastic', 'Jesus', 'having', 'just', 'learned', 'death', 'mother.My', 'one', 'complaint', 'film', 'fault', 'Newman', 'religious', 'overtones', 'get', 'little', 'heavy-handed', 'example', 'one', 'frame', 'where', 'Luke', 'lying', 'wearing', 'only', 'shorts', 'arms', 'stretched', 'out', 'one', 'foot', 'other', 'classic', 'crucifixion', 'pose', 'Then', 'scene', 'where', 'deserted', 'church', 'complete', 'wooden', 'cross', 'top', 'fate', 'loud', 'voice.This', 'film', 'still', 'very', 'entertaining', 'much', 'viewing', 'time']",N/A

But if you are to analyze this movie objectively, I think you'd agree that it pretty much sucks.  I know you're thinking: ""What?!?  How can anyone say anything so outrageous!  It's a *classic*!""  Hear me out.First, Newman isn't very believable.  It's not just that he's too good-looking to be on a chain gang.  It's not that he's a lousy actor.  He's not, he's a great actor.  It's just that in this movie his acting is lousy.  Think of the scene where Luke is broken by the guard after digging a hole and being beaten.  Even a high school drama teacher would blush at that kind of overacting.  It's embarrassing.Another annoying thing is the stage play (placement of actors within the shot).  The movie was done in the style that I thought had died out by 1967, but apparently hadn't.  It's a stagey, overly-dramatic style that kills any verisimilitude (it's also the sole problem I have with ""The Searchers"").  A group of people are lined up on one side of the screen while observing the action on the other side.  It's very unrealistic.  After seeing this in the jailhouse among the inmates three of four times, I began to expect at any moment that the other inmates, being grouped together like that, would burst into a rendition of ""New York, New York, it's a Helluva Town!""I also didn't like Newman's character.  I know that a movie like this needs to be understood within its own cultural milieu, and 1967 was a very turbulent time, with lots of people feeling good about fighting the Pow-uh in a lot of really stupid ways.  But stupid acts of public destruction are just that, not the archetype of an individual's struggle against the Man.And heavy handed.  Jeez.  Lying him out on a table like he's been crucified?  Dressing in white?  Could you *be* more obvious?Overall, a really obnoxious, poorly-executed and shallow presentation on a number of levels.

Luke, who is arrested for maliciously destroying federal property, (cutting the heads off of parking meters) is sent to jail for two years. He is as his name implies-cool. He has very little to say, but when he speaks, the other cons listen. Suffice it to say that he's a man who can win lots of cigarettes and money in the big house. Many humorous moments can be found in the opening hour, such as Luke's consumption of fifty eggs ('nobody ever 'et fitty eggs before) but are used sparsely in the last half. The viewer, after an hour starts to see, that even though Luke is a messiah to the other inmates, he is essentially flawed. His family life is less than satisfactory, and when his mother dies, he is expected to 'lose it', and if numerous attempts of fleeing jail is 'losing it' Luke is crazier than Hannibal Lecter. Now, what I sincerely love about this movie is that Luke is an excellent guy, he is calm and clear-headed and refuses to be just another prisoner.

By the way, the scene in which Luke confronts his dying mother Arletta is one of my favorites of all-time.

I became entranced with the movie, even though I hadn't a clue what it was except that Paul Newman was in it and it was cool.  By the time it got to the &quot;failure to communicate&quot; speech and I realized &quot;Hey, that's from the Guns and Roses song&quot; I had figured out what the movie was.  When it was over, I sat there watching the credits role up the screen, thinking about what I had just experienced (yes, not WATCHED, but EXPERIENCED).This is one hell of a great movie.  It has so many great parts in it.  The infamous egg scene.  You actually can see that Luke's stomach looks ready to burst from all those eggs!  I wonder how they got it to look like that?  Also, the part where Luke is &quot;broken&quot; by the prison bosses. His fellow inmates try to help him while he is digging and filling the ditch again and again by playing music, but, after they see him break, they don't even talk to him.  They don't so much as look at him.  After all he did for them, they just let him collapse of exhaustion in the aisle between the beds.  They were with him when he was riding high, when he didn't need them, but when he hit his lowest point and needed them they were nowhere to be found (well, they were right there in the room with him of course, but you know what I mean).  You are really feeling for Luke in that scene.There are a few things in this movie that confuse me.  First of all, why is Luke sentenced to a chain gang for so long just for cutting the tops off of parking meters?  And, I think it is the second time he escapes, when he's shaking the bush, the one guard (the man with no eyes) starts trying to shoot at him almost immediately.  Wouldn't he wait at least a couple seconds?  What if he really was just taking a leak?  Anyway, those are just a few things I found confusing.This is really one the best movies around.  It also ranks extremely high on what I call the Rewatchability Scale.  I have only seen this three times, all on TV, but whenever it's on, no matter what else I had been planning on watching, it just pulls me in everytime, and I can't take my eyes off until the credits roll.  Everytime is like the first time.  It is that great.  Also, if you like this, get The Shawshank Redemption.  Another great prison movie, a little different than this maybe, but stil it's in the same vain.And now I'm going to go check my TV guide, because my copy of this movie still hasn't arrived yet, and after writing this review I really feel like watching it.",5,Nobody Can Eat Fifty Eggs,1011225600,"01 17, 2002",2002,2725,"['was', 'flipping', 'channels', 'one', 'day', 'came', 'AMC', 'saw', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'cutting', 'tops', 'parking', 'meters', 'thought', 'quot', 'What', 'hell', 'doing', 'quot', 'rather', 'odd', 'thing', 'became', 'entranced', 'movie', 'even', 'had', ""n't"", 'clue', 'what', 'was', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'was', 'was', 'cool', 'time', 'got', 'quot', 'failure', 'communicate', 'quot', 'speech', 'realized', 'quot', 'Hey', 'Guns', 'Roses', 'song', 'quot', 'had', 'figured', 'out', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'When', 'was', 'sat', 'there', 'watching', 'credits', 'role', 'screen', 'thinking', 'what', 'had', 'just', 'experienced', 'yes', 'not', 'WATCHED', 'EXPERIENCED', '.This', 'one', 'hell', 'great', 'movie', 'so', 'many', 'great', 'parts', 'infamous', 'egg', 'scene', 'actually', 'can', 'see', 'Luke', 'stomach', 'ready', 'burst', 'eggs', 'wonder', 'how', 'got', 'look', 'Also', 'part', 'where', 'Luke', 'quot', 'quot', 'prison', 'bosses', 'fellow', 'inmates', 'try', 'help', 'digging', 'filling', 'ditch', 'again', 'again', 'playing', 'music', 'see', 'break', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'talk', 'do', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'look', 'did', 'just', 'let', 'collapse', 'exhaustion', 'aisle', 'beds', 'were', 'when', 'was', 'riding', 'high', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'when', 'hit', 'lowest', 'point', 'needed', 'were', 'nowhere', 'be', 'found', 'well', 'were', 'right', 'there', 'room', 'course', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'are', 'really', 'feeling', 'Luke', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'movie', 'confuse', 'First', 'why', 'Luke', 'sentenced', 'chain', 'gang', 'so', 'long', 'just', 'cutting', 'tops', 'parking', 'meters', 'think', 'second', 'time', 'when', 'shaking', 'bush', 'one', 'guard', 'man', 'eyes', 'trying', 'shoot', 'almost', 'immediately', 'Would', ""n't"", 'wait', 'least', 'couple', 'What', 'really', 'was', 'just', 'taking', 'leak', 'Anyway', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'things', 'found', 'confusing.This', 'really', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'also', 'extremely', 'high', 'what', 'call', 'Rewatchability', 'Scale', 'have', 'only', 'seen', 'three', 'times', 'TV', 'matter', 'what', 'else', 'had', 'been', 'planning', 'watching', 'just', 'everytime', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'eyes', 'credits', 'roll', 'Everytime', 'first', 'time', 'great', 'Also', 'like', 'get', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'great', 'prison', 'movie', 'little', 'different', 'maybe', 'stil', 'same', 'vain.And', 'now', ""'m"", 'going', 'go', 'check', 'TV', 'guide', 'copy', 'movie', 'still', ""n't"", 'arrived', 'yet', 'writing', 'review', 'really', 'feel', 'watching']",N/A

He ends up bunking with a truly long list of established and upcoming actors, and being bossed around by several more big names. Ultimately, Luke's affable non-conformity gets the best of him after several failed escape attempts, but he is ingrained into the memory of his fellow prisoners (and guards, for that matter).Well-acted and directed, the movie was oscar-nominated for Best Actor (Newman), writing and music. Part of Lalo Shifrin's score was subsequently used as the intro music to some network TV newscasts. George Kennedy won a best supporting actor as ""Dragline"", the leader of the prisoners. The photography is great, too.Some say it is Newman's best role. Could be, though I prefer ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"".The movie has one of the most famous quotes in all cinema history.

96750,A2ICI500LRO01K,0790731509,Kyle Wells,"[2, 2]","This is one of the great, old films from the sixties.  A visual and emotional masterpiece that managed to capture both critical and commercial  success, proving its appeal to a wide range of audiences.  This is an old  Hollywood movie but with some new Hollywood themes and ideas.Stuart  Rosenberg's 1967 film ""Cool Hand Luke"" is a story about a loner who after  cutting some heads off of parking meters is sent to prison and forced to  work on a chain gang.  This is the basic story but the film itself is more  about a man who is destined always to be a loner.  He is similar to Ethan  Edwards in ""The Searchers"" or Travis Bickle in ""Taxi Driver"" in a way that  all three of these characters are complete and utter loners.  They never  really fit in, at least not for long, but are always very interesting.At the beginning of the movie Luke is alone, drunk and in an act of  rebellion against the government starts vandalizing property.  We never  find out what drove him to this but we know it was ""rules and regulations"".  We know he was a war hero so perhaps he couldn't adjust to regular life  when he got home, who knows, the point is that he is a loner.  He is sent  to prison and at the beginning of his sentence he is still a loner.  He  isn't a regular prisoner yet but is still quite different from the other  new guys.  He has a certain air of intelligence around him and a little  cockiness too.  He eventually gains the prisoner's respect and eventually  becomes a sort of God in their eyes through stuff he does (including a  savvy poker move and one crazy egg-eating contest).  Through all of this  though, he is still not really one of them.  He is however one of them in  one scene of the movie: the one where the prisoners are shoveling tarmac  onto a road and Luke manages to ruffle up their spirits and the men finish  the job in a very short time.  In this scene all of the men come together  in a kind of mis-guided rebellion against the guards.  Luke is equal to  them at this point but doom is on the horizon and as the viewer you sense  this.  The death of Luke's mother changes everything and he gets ""rabbit in  his blood"" and proceeds to try to escape.  He is a loner again at this  point.The film goes on until the final stand off with the prison guards.  What happens is inevitable.  I'm not going to say what it is but it will  seem necessary to prove a point.Acting wise this is Paul Newman's best  work to date.

96753,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,0790731509,Linda Linguvic,"[8, 13]","This 1967 film begins when Paul Newman, cast as Luke Jackson, is arrested for cutting the tops off parking meters and sent to a southern chain gang prison for a two-year sentence.  Life is harsh for the men who must toil in the sun building roads each day.  But Luke is cool, very cool.  Soon he gains the respect of his fellow prisoners and becomes a leader himself.  He rebels constantly.  Nothing can stop him, not even a double set of chains on his legs. He's the lovable maverick that we all admire.Performances are excellent, especially that of George Kennedy, cast as Luke's buddy.  A youthful Dennis Hopper has a small part also.  Best of all though is the one scene with Jo Van Fleet, cast as Luke's mother, who comes to visit him in prison.  She's clearly dying and is lying in the back of a truck, unable to walk.  She smokes cigarettes constantly and is full of wisdom and grit and gumption.  She talks about how she just can't be like a female dog who don't recognize her pups after they've grown and tells Luke that his old man wasn't much for sticking around but he sure did make her laugh.  She laughs then and gets into a fit of coughing.  Newman does his usual fine job in a challenging part that has him break down at times but yet never lets him lose his sprit.The reason for Luke's rebellion was always a little murky and that was the strength of the screenplay. He never did anything really wrong; he just confronted authority.  And every time he ran away, he kept getting caught.  It also seemed that life on the outside wasn't so great for him and he yearned for the camaraderie of his fellow prisoners, who, by the way were all white as this film takes place in the segregated south.  Sometime, though, the prison seemed more like an army barracks.  There was always plenty of food and they didn't have to work on Sunday.  The men played cards and had some slight recreational activity.  For example, at one point they all took bets on whether or not Luke would be able to eat 50 hard-boiled eggs in the period of one hour.  Guess who won?The story held my interest even though there were no real surprises.  Sometimes though I thought that the actors cast as members of the chain gang were just a little too handsome and well muscled to be a typical cross-section of prisoners, but - after all, this is Hollywood.  However, it's a good film, with good performances.

And like most folk, I've loved it and its indomitable spirit ever since.Fast-forward to September 2008, and it arrives on the shiny new Blu Ray format - and to see it all cleaned up and pucker like this - and on a juicy big plasma screen too - is a treat few movie fans will be able to resist.As close to 'beautiful' as a man could get, Newman shone from the second he smiled in the opening credits. The rest of the cast too were just fantastic - it's almost a case of spot the famous face now - Harry Dean Stanton and the young Dennis Hopper in early roles, George Kennedy in probably his best part, Strother Martin, JD Cannon, Lou Antonio, Joe Don Baker...the list is endless...and all of it with a top screenplay by DONN PEARCE and FRANK PIERSON and complimented by a cool LALO SCHIFFRIN soundtrack.But the real treat for lifetime fans of the film is the PRINT. From the moment you see the red steel ""violation"" sign fill the screen as a drunk Lucas Jackson chops the head off yet another parking meter in his hick home town with a steel cutter, you know this print has been seen to properly - and I mean properly - it's absolutely gorgeous to look at.Most of the action takes place in the blistering heat of a Florida prison and its daily work details, so there's a sort of heat haze over every outdoor shot, but the clarity of the restored print is still fantastic. When some of the prisoners are going through the compounds gates - beautifully clear. Paul Newman as he lays on his top bunk before the 8pm curfew looking at a bare light bulb just inches away...again so clean...And then there's the film itself...there are so many great scenes:...the full-on sex-kitten JOY HARMON (27 at the time, but looking more like 20) washing the car in that clinging floral dress while the boys sweat nearby digging a trench in the road (""I'm dying here..."") is probably one of the sexiest and most delicious scenes ever put to film (George Kennedy calls her Lucille).  Strother Martin's famous lines about ""communication"" when one of the prisoners gets shirty, the mirror shades of ""Boss"" reflecting everything from the birds he shoots to approaching trucks, the boisterous and loaded card games, the egg-eating contest, hiding out in the chapel at the end of the film as 'boss man' comes after Lucas...George Kennedy dying inside as the spirit of his new friend is close to being broken, but doesn't break (Kennedy won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Role)...all of it brill...and like its title...effortlessly cool.There's a ""Making Of"" and Audio Commentary (not on some rental versions) and the subtitles are in French and Spanish only.""Cool Hand Luke"" on Blu Ray is a triumph.

Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[22, 27]","Paul Newman portrays Lucas Jackson, an iconic film anti-hero, in this classic film.Luke seems to have wandered aimlessly after winning several medals in WWII, and in the beginning of the film he's arrested for ""maliciously destroying municipal property"" - using a pipe cutter to cut the heads off of parking meters.The film has little exposition and in the next scene plunges our anti-hero in the middle of Division of Corrections, Road Prison 36, in the south.  Strother Martin plays the ""Cap'n"", the warden of this group, and Luke is instructed that all the other guards are to be called ""Boss"".  The bosses are frighteningly sadistic. Morgan Woodward is terrifying as ""the man with no eyes"". He speaks no words from behind his mirror sunglasses, but has a rifle brought to him every so often so that he can demonstrate his sharp-shooter accuracy.George Kennedy won Best-Supporting Actor Oscar as ""Dragline"", bull of the herd of prisoners.  Dragline leads the group,  running gambling and the small barracks ""bank"", and all the other prisoners follow his example and look to him as the source of what little self-respect they have.Luke and Dragline knock heads, figuratively and later on, literally, when Dragline beats Luke nearly unconscious in a brawling boxing match.  Dragline and the other prisoners live a pretty vivid fantasy life.  They blow-up the smallest slivver of hope into a bright shining ray of hope.  In a famous scene the prisoners are working just down the road from a beautiful blonde who stretches and teases and caresses the car she is washing with a soaped up sponge (this scene has been copied many times since in more juvenile films).  The other prisoners immediately attach themselves to the fantasy image of ""Lucille"".  She is just some innocent, beautiful girl who ""didn't know what she was doin'"" while she postured her curvy side for the men.  ""Oh, she knew what she was doing, and she loved every minute of it"", Luke states plainly, bursting the fantasy balloon of the other prisoners.  This leads to the famous boxing match with Dragline.Luke is insolent and rebellious and talks back to the Bosses in a way the other prisoners wouldn't dare. He gradually earns the respect of the other prisoners, and one of the best scenes of the film occurs at a poker game where Dragline finally comes to respect Luke and gives him his nickname.Luke doesn't want responsibility, even the responsibility of the admiration of the prisoners.  The film charms it's way under your skin, though, and it's very easy to lose the perspective that by the end you've spent the entire movie rooting for a man who by almost any other definition would be a loser.Paul Newman has seldom been better.",5,Sometimes Nothin' is a real Cool Hand,1127692800,"09 26, 2005",2005,2706,"['Paul', 'Newman', 'Lucas', 'Jackson', 'iconic', 'film', 'anti-hero', 'classic', 'film.Luke', 'have', 'wandered', 'aimlessly', 'winning', 'several', 'medals', 'WWII', 'beginning', 'film', 'arrested', 'maliciously', 'destroying', 'municipal', 'property', 'using', 'pipe', 'cutter', 'cut', 'heads', 'parking', 'meters.The', 'film', 'little', 'exposition', 'next', 'scene', 'anti-hero', 'middle', 'Division', 'Corrections', 'Road', 'Prison', '36', 'south', 'Strother', 'Martin', 'Cap', 'n', 'warden', 'group', 'Luke', 'instructed', 'other', 'guards', 'are', 'be', 'called', 'Boss', 'bosses', 'are', 'frighteningly', 'sadistic', 'Morgan', 'Woodward', 'terrifying', 'man', 'eyes', 'words', 'mirror', 'sunglasses', 'rifle', 'brought', 'so', 'often', 'so', 'can', 'demonstrate', 'sharp-shooter', 'accuracy.George', 'Kennedy', 'won', 'Best-Supporting', 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'Dragline', 'bull', 'herd', 'prisoners', 'Dragline', 'group', 'running', 'gambling', 'small', 'barracks', 'bank', 'other', 'prisoners', 'follow', 'example', 'look', 'source', 'what', 'little', 'self-respect', 'have.Luke', 'Dragline', 'knock', 'heads', 'figuratively', 'later', 'literally', 'when', 'Dragline', 'Luke', 'nearly', 'unconscious', 'brawling', 'boxing', 'match', 'Dragline', 'other', 'prisoners', 'live', 'pretty', 'vivid', 'fantasy', 'life', 'blow-up', 'smallest', 'slivver', 'hope', 'bright', 'shining', 'ray', 'hope', 'famous', 'scene', 'prisoners', 'are', 'working', 'just', 'road', 'beautiful', 'blonde', 'who', 'teases', 'car', 'washing', 'soaped', 'up', 'sponge', 'scene', 'been', 'copied', 'many', 'times', 'more', 'juvenile', 'films', 'other', 'prisoners', 'immediately', 'attach', 'fantasy', 'image', 'Lucille', 'just', 'innocent', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'was', 'doin', 'postured', 'curvy', 'side', 'men', 'Oh', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'loved', 'minute', 'Luke', 'plainly', 'bursting', 'fantasy', 'balloon', 'other', 'prisoners', 'famous', 'boxing', 'match', 'Dragline.Luke', 'insolent', 'rebellious', 'talks', 'back', 'Bosses', 'way', 'other', 'prisoners', 'would', ""n't"", 'dare', 'gradually', 'respect', 'other', 'prisoners', 'one', 'best', 'scenes', 'film', 'poker', 'game', 'where', 'Dragline', 'finally', 'respect', 'Luke', 'nickname.Luke', ""n't"", 'want', 'responsibility', 'even', 'responsibility', 'admiration', 'prisoners', 'film', 'way', 'skin', 'very', 'easy', 'lose', 'perspective', 'end', ""'ve"", 'spent', 'entire', 'movie', 'rooting', 'man', 'who', 'almost', 'other', 'definition', 'would', 'be', 'loser.Paul', 'Newman', 'seldom', 'been', 'better']",N/A

That's how great this cast is, and Paul Newman leads it with aplomb, his handsome charm a mask for what a fine actor he was. That said, this movie lacks the visual style and sense of bloody menace that other films of this ilk and time (Bonnie and Clyde, Sam Peckinpah's ouevre) were managing to bring to the table. Instead, the film has a brightly-lit look, and the actors have a pretty sweatiness about them that is almost more Calvin Klein ad than gritty prison film.

96768,A2BHWOS5PUGU78,0790731509,Mercy Bell,"[78, 86]","This movie is anything but cool. The characters are rough, foul, and awkward. The setting is realistic and harsh. It takes place in the scorching sun and humidity. There's many a scene of sweat and overheating men. Luke, though, is cool. He's the figure of composure; he's classy, smart, proud, and witty, but he rarely talks, keeping aloof. Or he's independent free man who won't let anyone get him down.There's a scene when he bluffs his way to victory in a poker match, thus his nickname &quot;cool hand Luke&quot;. Another scene has him fighting with another inmate until he's nearly unconscious, but he never surrenders. Yet another has him eating 50 eggs in an hour for a bet, and he doesn't give up. And I think this is the metaphor for the rest of the film. You can either see him as a cocky stubborn man, or more appropriately, a man who won't give up his freedom. He's thrown in prison and chain gang labor for a case of petty vandalism during a drunken stupor, yet he never utters a word about it, even during the most humiliating or painful punishment, but his conviction and sentence are hardly a matter in this film. Here is a man who is troubled and dysfunctional (as the story slightly exposes), but is already in an advanced state of personal freedom. Though he'd like to be living a normal life, searches for it, and deserves as much, he doesn't need it. He's spiritually and mentally invincible, and eventually it leads to his ultimate fate.Cool Hand Luke is a marvelous film. It's one fourth romantic, three fourths gritty reality. Paul Newman and the gorgeous cinematography are the romance. Newman nearly carries the film. Here's this movie star, a charismatic leading man who liberally uses his smile to get himself through scenes, but he immerses himself into his character. I think Luke is one of the greatest, most complex male characters to grace the screen, and Newman is really the only actor who could ever do him justice. But he isn't playing Newman, he's playing Luke, every inch of Luke.  He IS Luke, he is this renegade rebel, this charming dapper Dan, and this tragic everyman.  Newman's supporting cast is superb, in one of the best acted films I've ever seen. George Kennedy is incredible as the only sizable supporting character, though the rest of the cast do their utmost to fit their roles, especially the various sinister and slimy wardens, and they do it beautifully. No actor wastes his time on screen. They create the atmosphere.I just have to mention the dialogue. This is one of those films with incredible dialogue. Nothing is sappy or soupy. It embraces wit and logic, a lovely razor sharpness, and a down to earth realism. Every sentence is perfectly placed, there are no superfluous words, every character with they're own style that still allow them to sound like real people. End of dialogue discussion.This film is simple. It's simply told, simply filmed, and on the outside it's a simple story, but I think it delves a lot deeper than at first appearance. It's unpretentious. Without us knowing it paints an environment, it paints a setting. It's a movie with certain faintly stylized points and flourishes, with a bit of a Southern storytelling air and lilt to it, and a definite love for fun. But it's intense, from the acting, to plot twists and character developements, to minor &quot;action&quot; sequences (a movie populated by inmates and movie stars has to have some excitement), it has incredible depth in it's subtle symbolism and it's layered messages and it's performances with their emotional tapestries. Thus, it has an immense replayability quotient.This is drama at it's finest. It is a complex intriguing film that can get under your skin in it's rawness, but can still entertain you, and send you into that dreamy mesmerized state of being in awe of a film and the characters portrayed in it.",5,"It's sweltering out there, in there, anywhere",1038355200,"11 27, 2002",2002,3865,"['movie', 'anything', 'cool', 'characters', 'are', 'rough', 'foul', 'awkward', 'setting', 'realistic', 'harsh', 'place', 'scorching', 'sun', 'humidity', 'many', 'scene', 'sweat', 'overheating', 'men', 'Luke', 'though', 'cool', 'figure', 'composure', 'classy', 'smart', 'proud', 'witty', 'rarely', 'talks', 'keeping', 'aloof', 'independent', 'free', 'man', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'anyone', 'get', 'scene', 'when', 'bluffs', 'way', 'victory', 'poker', 'match', 'thus', 'nickname', 'quot', 'cool', 'hand', 'Luke', 'quot', 'scene', 'fighting', 'inmate', 'nearly', 'unconscious', 'never', 'surrenders', 'eating', '50', 'eggs', 'hour', 'bet', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'think', 'metaphor', 'rest', 'film', 'can', 'either', 'see', 'cocky', 'stubborn', 'man', 'more', 'appropriately', 'man', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'freedom', 'thrown', 'prison', 'chain', 'gang', 'labor', 'case', 'petty', 'vandalism', 'drunken', 'stupor', 'yet', 'never', 'word', 'even', 'most', 'humiliating', 'painful', 'punishment', 'conviction', 'sentence', 'are', 'hardly', 'matter', 'film', 'Here', 'man', 'who', 'troubled', 'dysfunctional', 'story', 'slightly', 'already', 'advanced', 'state', 'personal', 'freedom', ""'d"", 'like', 'be', 'living', 'normal', 'life', 'searches', 'as', 'much', ""n't"", 'need', 'spiritually', 'mentally', 'invincible', 'eventually', 'ultimate', 'fate.Cool', 'Hand', 'Luke', 'marvelous', 'film', 'one', 'fourth', 'romantic', 'three', 'fourths', 'gritty', 'reality', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'gorgeous', 'cinematography', 'are', 'romance', 'Newman', 'nearly', 'film', 'Here', 'movie', 'star', 'charismatic', 'leading', 'man', 'who', 'liberally', 'smile', 'get', 'scenes', 'character', 'think', 'Luke', 'one', 'greatest', 'most', 'complex', 'male', 'characters', 'grace', 'screen', 'Newman', 'really', 'only', 'actor', 'who', 'could', 'ever', 'do', 'justice', ""n't"", 'playing', 'Newman', 'playing', 'Luke', 'inch', 'Luke', 'Luke', 'renegade', 'rebel', 'charming', 'dapper', 'Dan', 'tragic', 'everyman', 'Newman', 'supporting', 'cast', 'superb', 'one', 'best', 'acted', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'George', 'Kennedy', 'incredible', 'only', 'sizable', 'supporting', 'character', 'rest', 'cast', 'do', 'utmost', 'fit', 'roles', 'especially', 'various', 'sinister', 'slimy', 'wardens', 'do', 'beautifully', 'actor', 'time', 'screen', 'create', 'atmosphere.I', 'just', 'have', 'mention', 'dialogue', 'one', 'films', 'incredible', 'dialogue', 'Nothing', 'sappy', 'soupy', 'wit', 'logic', 'lovely', 'razor', 'sharpness', 'down', 'earth', 'realism', 'sentence', 'perfectly', 'placed', 'are', 'superfluous', 'words', 'character', ""'re"", 'own', 'style', 'still', 'allow', 'sound', 'real', 'people', 'End', 'dialogue', 'discussion.This', 'film', 'simple', 'simply', 'told', 'simply', 'filmed', 'outside', 'simple', 'story', 'think', 'lot', 'deeper', 'first', 'appearance', 'unpretentious', 'knowing', 'environment', 'setting', 'movie', 'certain', 'faintly', 'stylized', 'points', 'flourishes', 'bit', 'Southern', 'storytelling', 'air', 'lilt', 'definite', 'love', 'fun', 'intense', 'acting', 'plot', 'twists', 'character', 'developements', 'minor', 'quot', 'action', 'quot', 'sequences', 'movie', 'populated', 'inmates', 'movie', 'stars', 'have', 'excitement', 'incredible', 'depth', 'subtle', 'symbolism', 'layered', 'messages', 'performances', 'emotional', 'tapestries', 'Thus', 'immense', 'replayability', 'quotient.This', 'drama', 'finest', 'complex', 'intriguing', 'film', 'can', 'get', 'skin', 'rawness', 'can', 'still', 'entertain', 'send', 'dreamy', 'mesmerized', 'state', 'being', 'awe', 'film', 'characters', 'portrayed']",N/A

""movie watcher""","[7, 7]","I've seen this movie many times and caught it on TV again this weekend, only reminding me what a classic it is, easily among the best of all time.Paul Newman plays Luke, an unbreakable spirit trapped in a place, and among men, determined to break him.  That spirit, though, is as much his strength as it is his burden.  As the story progresses, the audience comes to identify, not so much with Luke himself, but with his prisonmates.  We're in silent awe of his guts when he won't stay down in the fight scene with George Kennedy, we root for him on the edge of our seats during the oft-referenced egg eating scene, we watch with pity as he digs and fills the ditch - the guards working him to the breaking point, and we cheer like mad as he takes off in the same guards' truck, shackles be damned.It could easily be regarded as Newman's best acting.  I wouldn't disagree with that, but won't go that far myself only out of respect for his other all time great performances (e.g. The Hustler, Butch Cassidy, The Color of Money, The Verdict, and so on).Also, as a ""prison movie"", as much as I hate to lump this classic into such a narrow sub-genre, it is by far the best I've seen and its influence on future films of that genre, the good ones and the bad ones (e.g. Escape From Alcatraz, The Shawshank Redemption, and so on), is blatantly obvious.In short . . . a classic, definitely in my personal top ten of all time.",5,An underrated classic,1127088000,"09 19, 2005",2005,1419,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'many', 'times', 'caught', 'TV', 'again', 'weekend', 'only', 'reminding', 'what', 'classic', 'easily', 'best', 'time.Paul', 'Newman', 'Luke', 'unbreakable', 'spirit', 'trapped', 'place', 'men', 'determined', 'break', 'spirit', 'as', 'much', 'strength', 'burden', 'story', 'audience', 'identify', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'Luke', 'prisonmates', ""'re"", 'silent', 'awe', 'guts', 'when', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stay', 'down', 'fight', 'scene', 'George', 'Kennedy', 'root', 'edge', 'seats', 'oft-referenced', 'egg', 'eating', 'scene', 'watch', 'pity', 'ditch', 'guards', 'working', 'breaking', 'point', 'cheer', 'like', 'mad', 'same', 'guards', 'truck', 'shackles', 'be', 'damned.It', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'regarded', 'Newman', 'best', 'acting', 'would', ""n't"", 'disagree', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'far', 'only', 'respect', 'other', 'time', 'great', 'performances', 'e.g', 'Hustler', 'Butch', 'Cassidy', 'Color', 'Money', 'Verdict', 'so', '.Also', 'prison', 'movie', 'as', 'much', 'hate', 'lump', 'classic', 'narrow', 'sub-genre', 'far', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'influence', 'future', 'films', 'genre', 'good', 'ones', 'bad', 'ones', 'e.g', 'Escape', 'Alcatraz', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'so', 'blatantly', 'obvious.In', 'short', 'classic', 'definitely', 'personal', 'top', 'ten', 'time']",N/A
96771,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,0790731509,mirasreviews,"[5, 5]","""Cool Hand Luke"" was adapted from the novel by Don Pearce, who spent some time on a Florida chain gang and based his leading character, Lucas Jackson, one-third on a real man he knew in prison, one-third on himself, and the rest is fiction. Lucas ""Luke"" Jackson (Paul Newman) is sent to a Southern prison camp for ""maliciously destroying municipal property while under the influence"" -busting parking meters, where the prisoners work on a chain gang doing road work. A big, boisterous inmate nicknamed ""Dragline"" (George Kennedy) at first sees Luke as a challenge to his position, but soon comes to admire Luke's daring and stubbornness. His fellow prisoners find Luke's fearlessness inspiring, but the prison warden and guards are uneasy with it.George Kennedy won the 1968 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of the friendly, simple country guy who idolizes Luke. He's one of many notable character actors in the film's large supporting cast. ""Cool Hand Luke"" harkens back to the prison films of the 1930s, also produced by Warner Brothers, in its social conscience message and antihero protagonist. It particularly reminds me of ""I Am a Fugitive from the Chain Gang"" (1932), written by another man with experience on a Southern chain gang. ""Cool Hand Luke"" is beautifully shot by cinematographer Conrad Hall, who would win an Academy Award much later for another Newman film, ""Road to Perdition"" (2002). I don't think I've ever seen a camera move so much on landscapes. It's captivating.One thing that characterizes films with enduring greatness is that they invite more than one reading of the material. ""Cool Hand Luke"" is a character study of Lucas Jackson, a man whose stubbornness is less a conviction than it is self-destruction. Or perhaps it is not about Luke at all, but about how those around him react to his unwillingness to conform. If we are to view Luke simply as an inmate, he is a masochistic fool. If we interpret the prison as a microcosm of the greater society, he is the nonconformist through whom the rest of the population lives vicariously and  whom authorities fear simply because he does not fear them. The prison has nitpicky rules, but there doesn't seem to be much reason to disobey them. Yet Luke cannot bring himself to live that way. Perhaps the conclusion is that we need people who are a little nuts to flout society's norms sometimes.The DVD (Warner Brothers 2008): Bonus features are one featurette, an audio commentary, and a theatrical trailer (3 min). ""A Natural-Born World Shaker: Making Cool Hand Luke"" (30 min) includes recent interviews with director Stuart Rosenberg, screenwriter Frank Pierson, Paul Newman biographer Eric Lax, novelist Dan Pearce, and many members of the cast and crew who talk about getting the film made, camaraderie on set, and filming. The audio commentary is by Newman biographer Eric Lax, who did not participate in the film, so he has a scholar's view, not personal recollections. He talks about the making of the film, its anti-authoritarian themes, characters, sets, and takes us through the film. Subtitles available in English SDH, French.

It was a different sort of a movie at a time when Hollywood specialized in different sorts of movies.  It took place in a Southern prison farm and it starred Paul Newman in the title role.  If he hadn't had a few other top-notch performances (""The Hustler"" quickly jumps to mind) this would easily be the pick as his all-time best.  He really is the personification of cool at a time we all thought we knew the real meaning of the term.The story is a rather simple one; a two-time loser joins a bunch of others on a chain gang.  We soon discover the hierarchy of the group which includes the leader; Dragline (played by George Kennedy in an Oscar-winning role).  Luke isn't taken all that seriously until he makes an incredible boast and then proceeds to back it up.  He becomes king of the hill but, when personal tragedy strikes, he escapes the prison.  His noteriety grows in his absence but he is eventually caught and discovers just how hot Hell can be.  There's more to the story but the ending is a bittersweet one that needn't be spoiled for the first-time viewer.  The story I did relate isn't giving much away because this movie's greatness lies in the characters themselves; the story is just a way for us to get to know them better.This is a movie that stays with you for a long time.

Hansen,"[4, 6]","One of the reasons that the late 60s/early 70s was such a powerful era in filmmaking is the emergence of the anti-hero (defined as an individual with heroic qualities, but not in a position we would usually find a hero). This is symbolized greatly in `Cool Hand Luke'. We can identify with Luke because his crime is venial and his concerns over the great questions of life are ours. It is because of this and his persuasive charm that the other prisoners (played remarkably well by Kennedy and a host of others to include Wayne Rogers, Ralph Waite, Dennis Hopper and one of the actors who played a crewmember on `Alien') live vicariously through him.Filled with memorable scenes (the boxing match, 50 eggs, the fealty of his fellow prisoners who help him finish his food after his stomach is shrunk in solitary confinement, `shakin' it here boss', the sneezing dogs, and of course the carwash) and outstanding character development (created by what is said and what is not said, i.e. the visiting brother), one of screen history's most repeated lines and the great acting of Newman, this movie deserves to be called a classic.

96795,AGZVS6M8XJGN6,0790731509,"Roberto Frangie ""Robert""","[4, 5]","The rebel character in Hollywood after the death of James Dean went through a period of transition and did not gain definite new characteristics until the late sixties...The three established rebel/anti-heroes in movies were Paul Newman, Warren Beatty, and Steve McQueen...In 1967, screen audiences were exposed to two new rebel hero characters, Clyde Barrow, a rebel without a cause with enough guts to strike out against any bank, and Luke Jackson, an anti-hero 'born to lose,' but a man full of pride and dignity...""Cool Hand Luke"" resumes Newman's career as another rebel, a non-conformist, a perfect hero who beats the system wherever...Superbly directed by Stuart Rosenberg, Newman exhibits a complete arrangement of emotions invading every nuance and implication... Resources of his true command of his technical acting are breathtaking in their impact... The motion picture (nominated for 4 Academy Awards) won him his 4th Academy Award nomination...Newman is again a cynical loner, but he's also charming, and everything is calculated to involve us with him; like ""Hombre,"" the film begins and ends with closeups of his face, but here, appropriately, he has an engaging smile...The opening, where he drinks beer, unscrews tops from parking meters and mumbles to the arriving cop, recalls Dean's drunken incoherence at the start of ""Rebel Without a Cause""--an apt title for Luke... He breaks rules for no apparent reason, wherever he is, including the chain gang to which he's sentenced...Unlike Paul Muni in ""I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang,"" who steals only to eat and is turned by society into a hardened criminal, Luke is a criminal from the start, and his crime isn't motivated by hunger... It's a meaningless anti-authority gesture--the existentialist ""gratuitous act,"" committed purely for the sake of committing it... Luke engages our sympathy not because he is economically deprived or the product of an unhappy home, but because for him the act of rebellion is its own justification: he's the perfect sixties hero...Initially, Luke alienates the prisoners by his indifference and sarcasm, and the top dog, Dragline (George Kennedy) picks a fight with him... Luke is severely beaten but keeps fighting, and this--plus his continual defiance of the guards--wins him the men's respect... Their admiration grows when he proves he can eat 50 hard-boiled eggs, one after the other, in only one hour, another gratuitous act (""somethin' to do"").But Luke gradually becomes a victim of the excessive admiration, rebelling because they expect him to, which leads to a pattern of escapes and captures... As the warden says, ""What we got here is a failure to communicate. Some men you just can't reach."" Even though Luke becomes subservient after torture, he again escapes... Dragline admires the way he fooled the guards while planning all along to escape... But Luke says he really did break down, and asserts: ""l never planned anything in my life."" Even his last act is motivated not by heroism but by impulse...The physical punishment Newman's characters often undergo reaches an extreme here, as Luke constantly invites pain (in his fight with Dragline, he says, ""You're gonna have to kill me.""). Underlying his sometimes vigorous rebelliousness is despair at a cruelly indifferent world... But the men need a hero, and Dragline perpetuates the myth, telling them that he had ""that Luke smile"" to the very end... We last see a montage of shots of Luke smiling--the men's vision of him as unbeaten and almost immortal...Newman's performance is among his best, and Luke is one of his definitive studies of non conformism... As in ""Hombre,"" he underplays, but in a loose, relaxed, ""cool"" manner... He's affecting in a wide range of moods: quiet detachment, wry contempt, raw courage, exhaustion, exuberance, gentleness, anger, resignation...There's a superb1y understated scene in which Luke's dying mother (Jo Van Fleet) visits him... Like Rocky Graziano, he says he tried to live cleanly, but could never find a way... But the mood is quite different here: instead of intense emotion, there are on1y ingenious expressions of uneasiness, regret, sadness, acceptance... Newman conveys his unspoken affection entirely through his glances and reactions, as she wistfully remarks that she once had high hopes for him...The actor even survives the film's pretentious attempts to make him a mock-Christ figure... Besides the obvious sacrifice-resurrection parallel, he's even shown in the exact crucifixion position following his fifty-egg (Last Supper?) ordeal... There are two badly conceived dialogs with a God he doesn't believe in--after which he realizes, ""l gotta find my own way,"" a rather unconcealed statement of existential despair--but Newman performs them with quiet conviction....His mock religion is better suggested by the bottle opener he wears in lieu of a religious medal... And the despair is effectively dramatized in his reaction to his mother's death... The men leave him by himself, and he sits on his bed, playing the banjo... With a sad, breaking voice, he sings a religious parody: ""l don't care if it rains or freezes, long as 1 got my plastic Jesus..."" He looks down and begins crying, but sings faster, obsessively, withdrawing into himself and expressing his utter loneliness in a world that has no God... It's one of the most moving scenes in all of Newman's work...Paralleled to ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"" ""Cool Hand Luke"" is a character study, which works beautifully, very well-made with sense of graphic imagery and cinema view, a good-looking film with superb photography in Color, extremely good as an entertainment...",4,Very well-made with sense of graphic imagery and cinema

The authority automatically has a problem with him for this petty crime and he spends the entire movie doing what he has done his whole life: being Cool Hand Luke. Cool Hand Luke does his manual labor with zeal and Cool Hand Luke takes insane bets. Cool Hand Luke doesn't give up. This is his one major flaw, because the authorities want to break Luke's spirit which cannot be broken. Herein lies the point of the film.Sure, Luke is a rebel, but his failure to conform is not thrown at the audience as if it were a message. The events just happen; Luke just happens. This makes for a much more realistic movie and a much more likable character.Luke could be compared to James Dean's character in Rebel Without a Cause, but that comparison would be flawed. Dean's character is much younger in age and in spirit. Luke has been hardened by age and experience; he was probably very similar to Dean's character in youth but has quieted down a bit. In consequence, Luke is less whiney and more to-the-point.Cool Hand Luke is a popular film because the character is one that people can relate to and respect immensely. If anyone has known someone similar, one can relate to this statement. Luke is the type of person that everyone wants to be but often fails to become.

96801,A1K94LXX833JTT,0790731509,Sanpete,"[0, 0]","Warner Home Video has announced the release of a new Deluxe Edition of Cool Hand Luke on standard DVD and Blu-ray, with new special features.  There will be a making-of featurette called ""A Natural-Born World-Shaker: Making Cool Hand Luke,"" which the press release describes as ""an in-depth look at the creation of an uncompromising classic.""  There will also be an audio commentary with Paul Newman biographer Eric Lax, and the theatrical trailer.  Only the theatrical trailer and some text production notes are on the old DVD.Cool Hand Luke is the story of a man (Newman) who, by a minor offense combined with stubborn if at times casually guided will, gets himself into increasingly deep trouble in a tough Southern prison.  It's played as part comedy, part gritty drama.  Luke's cool, fearless, devil-may-care attitude and escapades make him an icon among his fellow prisoners, until he is brought to abject desperation, ultimately rising again and falling to become a legend.The film is famous for a hard-boiled egg eating contest and, especially, a quote that has entered the pantheon of movie quotes: ""What we have here is a failure to communicate.""  The title character's nickname comes from another quote, made after he bluffs to win at poker: ""sometimes nothin' can be a real cool hand,"" a quote that has ironic punch in the context of the movie as a whole.  Newman was nominated for an Oscar, and George Kennedy won one for his supporting role.  Strother Martin is unforgettable as the twisted prison captain.I enjoy this movie, but I've never completely loved it the way many do.  Parts of it never seemed quite real to me (not ""uncompromising"" either), not with the truthful feel the similarly themed One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest has, for example.  But it is a classic, with memorable characters, scenes, and storyline.  I'd probably give it four or four and a half stars, but I'll round up for the new special features, which I look forward to.The new SD Deluxe Edition ishere.

is not Region A and it does say US and Canada only (confused)Moving on.Still looking to purchase a region free blu ray player in Asia when I can afford but was so excited this one run for me, thanks Warner.I was 11 years old when this was produced and first seen the movie in the cinema a few years later.My cinema experiance was on a wet Wed afternoon in the North East of England whilst skipping School at the local Odeon my place of escape as a confused teenager.What a fantastic story, just amazing and I then understood why I was a rebel of some sort who wanted more from Life and was willing to work for it.Romance over, grown up now and can still be a rebel at times.Not sure what the budjet was for this movie and how they even managed to edit it.Must have been a lot of dumped takes.For instance look at the boxing, the low camera angles in the early part of the fight on a Sat afternoon.Luke gets up from another knock down and peers at the ankle chains of a bystander, was that a mistake as later on all were seen to be free.The punch shots in your face, cinema at its best and we are talking the 1960 era here.The acting was fantastic, looks like they all had fun making this one.Wish I could see some out takes also.Before I move to the Blu Ray experiance I would say for one this movie has been underestimated as one of the greats since cinema rolled out the first.Place it in the action/story cat and over the las 50 years this one should be in the top ten if not top five.The movie story justs move on with great directing to a point in a cinema you will never leave your seat for a snack or the bathroom.Pee in the bottle you are holding empty (rebel)and starve as in my case I did not because some kind lady sold me something that used up my bus fare home.What a walk home though, give me time to think my rebel ways were not the way to go even though my Parents in my eyes did not understand me.I asked my Mother for boiled eggs and I think She gave me two fried with chips.Always like a boiled egg after this movie.I had to educate them on how smart I was (later)The blu Ray transforamtion is fantastic, my opinion as I have it on vcd, dvd, vhs.Look at the sweat coming off the guys on blu ray, amazing.The whole blu ray experiance is a must for such a great movie that has probably faded in the history of great movies.All I will say is buy it and you will play this again and again to lets say a visitor aud because you can never be bored with great acting and directing.Have some iced cool drinks on hand also as this will make you feel hot.My two teenage kids just watched it also and asking daddy who is Paul Newman.I told them He is the Brad Pitt of that era and it seemed to have gone down well.Cinemas world wide should have a day when they show epics on a grand scale to give the younger generation a chance to see movie making at its best without the usual digital imposed scenes that we see now.Oh well, I think you will all agree I am an old fart but an old person who loves cinema at its best and has seen the benefits of upscaling to blu ray to view old great movies like this without deleting.Enjoy.",5,Even more cool on Blu Ray,1328918400,"02 11,

Luke is a former war hero who when very drunk one night starts damaging parking meters (the very beginning of the film) and ends up serving time. Although apparently a very laid back character, the death of his mother changes Luke's attitude and the film hinges on this critical moment.I've always enjoyed the film in the past on TV, but was too young to have seen it at the cinema first time round. So to see it now on DVD, in widescreen, on a large TV only emphasised just how good it really is. There are many classic scenes, the most famous of which is the car wash (for the men anyway), and the attempt to eat 50 boiled eggs. Quite a few others will leave an impression on you as well.Its Newmans film all the way but George Kennedy (also still alive at the time of writing) pushes him close as 'dragline' in the acting honours. Also listen out for Lalo Schifrin's (Jazz Pianist and Film/TV Score writer - most famously Mission Impossible) superbly atmospheric music as well.The film is currently rank 118 in the IMDB list of the top 250 films of all time.

I saw this a few days ago on TV and was hooked within the first fifteen minutes and as I was unable to finish watching it I bought it straight away and I know already that this will be one film I will watch again and again. This has an amazing performance from Paul Newman as Luke, a loner who refuses to bow to the might of authority, whether it be in society or in the prison he is sent to. He manages to inspire his fellow inmates with his humour and quiet dignity in the face of the warders cruelty and you can't help but connect with his character. This has many memorable scenes and the egg eating scene is wonderfully funny and yet others scenes are especially poignant and emotional. The direction is pretty good, if a little dated and stylised, but this only adds to the character and classic nature of the film on offer. The supporting cast are very good in this film and the entire ensemble elevate this film from being merely good to being great. This also has an excellent 'making of' documentary included on the extras.

And he gets himself sentenced to a chain-gang, after he gets drunk and destroys some parking meters one night.The chain-gang camp, is run by a seemingly fatherly, yet ruthless Warden, called the Captain. Luke and his fellow inmates, are forced to perform back-breaking chain-gang duty, in the scorching southern heat every day. Under the directive of the Captain, brutal punishment is meted out by the prison guards, to any inmate who disobeys the stringent prison rules.Luke, rebellious soul that he is, refuses to knuckle-under to the sadistic guards. Luke's steely determination, wins him the reverent admiration of the other inmates. After two failed escape attempts, Luke is subjected to vicious torture, by the guards. The Captain, with the help of the monstrous guards, makes it his mission to break Luke's spirit.Paul Newman is amazing in his role as Luke. I couldn't imagine any other actor portraying the character of Luke, as deftly as Newman did. George Kennedy plays Luke's burly inmate pal, Dragline, with consummate skill. Jo Van Fleet, gives a wonderfully poignant performance, as Luke's dying mother, Arleta.

When I was twelve, I watched it; the next time it came on, I taped it, and watched it probably more than 50 times over the next few  years (I didn't know for a long time that the TV version has several scenes  cut out for length, so getting it on video was a new revelation). What is  it about &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot; that is so moving? Well, it starts with  Paul Newman's performance. Lucas Jackson is one of the most psychologically  complex characters in the history of cinema, and Newman, criminally denied  the Oscar for this film, makes him seem larger-than-life without saying  much. Everything that comes out of his mouth is a revelation. The Christ  allusions, which are fittingly done, heighten the sense of injustice that  Luke is being slowly crucified by the lawmen, simply because he won't bend  to their rules. On the surface, Luke seems self-destructive and ignorant,  but in repeated watchings of the film, it becomes apparent that Luke is  answering to a call that is bigger than the prison, bigger than the bosses,  bigger than the law itself. I could go on and on about the myriad other  ways in which this film is perfect, but why bother? I only get 1,000 words.  Suffice it to say that this is the movie that makes George Kennedy, of all  people, seem noble. YOU MUST SEE THIS FILM.

""Pop Culture Addict""","[5, 22]","The anti-establishment attitude of the Sixties is personified in the lead character of Stuart Rosenberg's ""Cool Hand Luke."" While Paul Newman is indeed ""cool"" in every sense of the word in the title role, the film unfortunately fails to recreate that same restless energy and urgency of ""Rebel Without A Cause"" (1955) - the spiritual predecessor of ""Cool Hand Luke"" from the decade prior.Luke Jackson (Newman) is caught vandalizing parking meters early one morning. As punishment for his deed, he is sentenced to a prison farm chain gang for two years. Unsurprisingly, Luke refuses to conform to the norms imposed on him by both the guards and the other prisoners. His defiance turns him into a folk hero among his fellow inmates but the prison staff is less amused by Luke's antics since his rebelliousness leads to repeated escape attempts from the camp. Defiant to the end, Luke eventually forces a final confrontation between himself and the system he so despises.""Cool Hand Luke"" is merely a serviceable vehicle for Newman. He turns in his usual stellar performance but the film is just one set piece after another interspersed with some occasional witty dialogue. The film does have some high-points - co-stars George Kennedy and Strother Martin are great and Dennis Hopper, Harry Dean Stanton and Wayne Rogers ably fill their smaller supporting roles. Also, the interplay between Luke and his mother (Jo Van Fleet) is genuinely touching and helps to add tremendous emotional depth to Luke's character. However, ""Cool Hand Luke"" does not take its exploration of conformity, individuality, and reform far enough.

The release year of this film reflects it's content - Hollywood was busy pushing aside film heroes like Jimmy Stewart who reflected and performed to traditional American values, and instead was promoting the anti-hero; for example, James Dean.Dialogue in this film when Newman's character, Luke, is conversing with his mother is a mishmash best understood as the screenwriter trapped between the wish to throw old conventions aside, and his fear that going too far would alienate the paying public.This film is leftism trying to emerge from the shellacking it took when The American Way emerged triumphant from World War II. Vietnam and Nixon's resignation would provide all the cover leftist needed to fully emerge out from under their rocks.

Luke (Newman) was somehow in that situation he's become such a hero to the other prisoners that he can't disappoint them. Even when he told the truth about the fake photo and the final escape (you've got to watch it for context), they turn it into something that will support their ""hero"" fantasy. In short they're into the image and not the person. In Luke's darkest hour they all left him, somehow implying their shallow relationship.The character Luke is enigmatic, it's really hard to tell with certainty why he is the way he is. Paul Newman embodied the role perfectly, this might be his most beloved role of his career probably even more than Butch Cassidy and ""Fast"" Eddie Felson. Paul Newman exhibited great range as an actor, he got to be this really intense guy and then play the ""cool"" guy and then he's got  to be really quietly moving without making any big acting dramatics. He is truly one of the best actors.There are lots of great moments particularly the now famous and infamous ""egg-eating contest"".

It reconnects them to the pre-Yuppie period of their lives when they saw themselves as James Dean/Paul Newman rebels against The Man.  Now they are The Man, but they can still get misty-eyed watching Cool Hand Luke and pretending to be like him.Plenty of posts have mentioned the Christ-allusions, which show that this film operates somewhere in the realm of myth and allegory.  The problem with cinematic myth and allegory is that characters easily become caricatures.  Luke has personality, but every other prisoner but Kennedy's character seems to be just an Everyman as foil to Luke's greatness.  Nobody else has any fight, intelligence, or charisma?  As every jeweler knows, it is a cheap trick to make a jewel look brighter by placing it amongst junk.This film is like a lazy stroll through a garden.  It can be slow going, but there are some real pleasures.  The oft-mentioned egg-eating scene is one example.  So too Luke's punishment digging, refilling, and redigging the ditch.I don't know what was going through the minds of the Oscar judges when they awarded the Best Supporting Actor trophy to George Kennedy.  His role is interesting and (as the Judas figure) crucial, but as always he overplays it.  Whereas Paul Newman and all of the prison officials give naturalistic performances, George Kennedy is a hambone.Also straining credulity is that these prisoners almost never fight.  (But there is one good fight scene between Newman and Kennedy.)  Indeed, this is the least menacing group of convicts you could hope to come across.  Also, for a prison film it is oddly asexual.  In one scene the prisoners lust after a busty blond washing her car, but she makes no further appearances.  Possible homosexuality amongst the prisoners might be hinted at, but it's hard to tell.  (Dancing together, jumping rope in tandem with the same rope.)

Paul Newman is at his peak both physically and as an actor portraying Luke Jackson, a man who is at odds with the authoritarian structure of life in general. Once a decorated war hero, he finds himself on a chain gang as punishment for his ill-advised revenge (beheading parking meters). Luke was obviously the hope of his family, and was the apple of his mother's eye. The story is set fully into motion when his beloved mother dies and Luke is denied leave to attend her funeral. This last act of arbitrary authoritarian heavy-handedness crystallizes in Luke the final desire to resist The Boss even if it kills him.The movie is beautiful to look at. It is entertaining to play ""spot the future star"" during the prison barracks scenes (look fast for Dennis Hopper and Wayne Rogers). However, the movie eventually becomes a thoughtful exploration of what it means to be a Christ-figure, and what it means to feel abandoned by your god.

96824,A2Q13PHEXGR48Q,0790731509,T O'Brien,"[4, 7]","Cool Hand Luke is a great movie from the 60s that features one of Paul Newman's best performances.  After slicing the heads off of parking meters, Lucas Jackson is sent to work on a chain gang for two years.  At first, Luke is disliked by many of his fellow inmates, but with time he comes to earn their respect.  However, Luke is the rebellious type and refuses to be broken down by authority.  This is a great movie about a rebel who refuses to give in to authority no matter what the consequences.  Luke is somewhat of an outcast who has never fit in with the ""norm"" of society.  Cool Hand Luke is full of famous scenes/lines like the ""What we have here is a failure to communicate"" line or the eating 50 eggs in an hour scene, but overall the movie is about one's man refusal to live the norm.  Highly recommended if you have not seen it.Paul Newman gives one of his best performances as Lucas Jackson, a rebellious prisoner on a chain gang who refuses to give up or be beaten down by authority.  Newman's Luke is a man who struggles with the hand he has been dealt in life, and tries to overcome those problems.  George Kennedy won a Best Supporting Oscar for his role as Dragline, a fellow member of the chain gang who becomes Luke's friend.  Strother Martin is excellent as the Captain, the warden of the facility who delivers the ""communication"" line.  In a brief, one-scene part, Jo Van Fleet is perfect as Arletta, Luke's dying mother.  The chain gang is a huge list of character actors including JD Cannon, Lou Antonio, Robert Drivas, Harry Dean Stanton, Wayne Rogers, and a young Dennis Hopper.  The movie also stars Morgan Woodward as Boss Godfrey, ""No Eyes,"" Luke Askew, Anthony Zerbe, and Clifton James.This is a movie that deserves a 2-disc special edition DVD, not the lousy cardboard Warner Brothers version with no extras other than a trailer and widescreen presentation.  Moviegoers obviously love this movie so why isn't there a Special Edition DVD out there?  Still, this is a classic movie and a must-have overall, so don't let this DVD scare you away.",5,What we have here is a failure to communicate,1112486400,"04 3, 2005",2005,2075,"['Cool', 'Hand', 'Luke', 'great', 'movie', '60s', 'one', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'best', 'performances', 'slicing', 'heads', 'parking', 'meters', 'Lucas', 'Jackson', 'sent', 'work', 'chain', 'gang', 'two', 'years', 'first', 'Luke', 'disliked', 'many', 'fellow', 'inmates', 'time', 'earn', 'respect', 'However', 'Luke', 'rebellious', 'type', 'be', 'broken', 'down', 'authority', 'great', 'movie', 'rebel', 'who', 'give', 'authority', 'matter', 'what', 'consequences', 'Luke', 'somewhat', 'outcast', 'who', 'never', 'fit', 'norm', 'society', 'Cool', 'Hand', 'Luke', 'full', 'famous', 'scenes/lines', 'What', 'have', 'here', 'failure', 'communicate', 'line', 'eating', '50', 'eggs', 'hour', 'scene', 'movie', 'one', 'man', 'refusal', 'live', 'norm', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'it.Paul', 'Newman', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'Lucas', 'Jackson', 'rebellious', 'prisoner', 'chain', 'gang', 'who', 'give', 'up', 'be', 'beaten', 'down', 'authority', 'Newman', 'Luke', 'man', 'who', 'hand', 'been', 'dealt', 'life', 'tries', 'overcome', 'problems', 'George', 'Kennedy', 'won', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Oscar', 'role', 'Dragline', 'fellow', 'member', 'chain', 'gang', 'who', 'Luke', 'friend', 'Strother', 'Martin', 'excellent', 'Captain', 'warden', 'facility', 'who', 'communication', 'line', 'brief', 'one-scene', 'part', 'Jo', 'Van', 'Fleet', 'perfect', 'Arletta', 'Luke', 'dying', 'mother', 'chain', 'gang', 'huge', 'list', 'character', 'actors', 'including', 'JD', 'Cannon', 'Lou', 'Antonio', 'Robert', 'Drivas', 'Harry', 'Dean', 'Stanton', 'Wayne', 'Rogers', 'young', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'movie', 'also', 'Morgan', 'Woodward', 'Boss', 'Godfrey', 'No', 'Eyes', 'Luke', 'Askew', 'Anthony', 'Zerbe', 'Clifton', 'James.This', 'movie', '2-disc', 'special', 'edition', 'DVD', 'not', 'lousy', 'cardboard', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'version', 'extras', 'other', 'trailer', 'widescreen', 'presentation', 'Moviegoers', 'obviously', 'love', 'movie', 'so', 'why', ""n't"", 'Special', 'Edition', 'DVD', 'there', 'Still', 'classic', 'movie', 'must-have', 'overall', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'DVD', 'scare', 'away']",N/A

Newman has had several memorable roles, but his turn in COOL HAND LUKE is one of his best and my favorite of Newman's movies. The movie is filled with unforgettable scenes (Lucile washing the car; the egg scene) and lines (&quot;What we got here is failure to communicate.&quot;). The film has a great supporting cast and George Kennedy won an Academy Award. The movie can be described as a typical 1960s antiestablishment rebellion movie. However, the film is much more than that. At it's core is a story of humanity shrouded in Christlike imagery.

Paul Newman shows in this film (And his earlier role in ""The Hustler"") why he is one of the greatest actors of all time. Surprisingly, he did not win an Academy Award for his role as Luke Johnson, a born loser who ends up on a chain gang for destroying parking meters. George Kennedy did however win an Academy Award as Dragline, who becomes a sort of mentor to Luke. Luke's problem is that he has a lot of guts, but has no brains. That's why I like the phrase I used for my title. It best shows the spirit of Luke: Keep fighting, even when you are beat.There are many other elements that make this movie great. Besides the acting, there is an authentic feel to the picture's depiction of the chain gang. We can actually feel the heat bearing down on us as the men work in the fields or tar roads (This feel can be attributed to co-author Donn Pearce, who was on a chain gang for two years). This film, however, is probably most remembered for the characters of ""The man with no eyes"" and the prison captain who utters the famous line ""What we've got here is...failure to communicate"".

""Cool Hand Luke"" appeared at a time when people were increasingly losing their respect for authority. So it's natural to see Lucas Jackson as a rebel against the establishment, and nothing more.But Lucas is, in a way, a lot less -- ""A 'nothing' hand can be cool"". As he says to Dragline, ""I've never planned anything in my life."" He has no goal or purpose, moving aimlessly from one thing to another (we learn he was promoted several times in the Army, but demoted to buck private before discharge), and the crime for which he's sentenced -- ""decapitating"" parking meters -- is a pointless prank committed during an evening of drunken boredom.Lucas's only purpose is to defy authority, and he does that right well. /Why/ isn't clear, but one could assume his motivation is ""If my life has no constructive purpose, I might as well give the bird to the powers that be"".One can also view Lucas as self-destructive. His sharp wit is not only that of an intelligent person, but of a morbid person. (I know this from personal experience.) And when his sweet mother -- who loves him, as she says, for no reason at all -- dies, his decline begins in earnest. It can be argued that his repeated attempts to escape are attempts to get himself killed. Which is what happens. (Didn't you know that?)Luke is neither hero nor anti-hero. He is a man who sacrifices himself on society's cross because he doesn't really fit in anywhere -- it's the only thing he /can/ do. And society is happy to oblige his desire for self-destruction.No doubt about it, this is a great film.The Blu-ray transfer is generally excellent, showcasing the outstanding cinematography, both in and out of the studio. The only disappointment is having to hear Lalo Schiffrin's imaginative score in mono. The ""making of"" featurette is outstanding, way-above-average for this sort of thing.PS: The correct phrase is ""What we have here is... failure to communicate.""
