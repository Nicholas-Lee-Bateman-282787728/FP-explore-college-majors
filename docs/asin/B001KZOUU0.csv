That would have been heroic in itself, but these three brothers didn't stop there, they used guerilla tactics against the Germans as well. Good quality DVD with plenty of replayability.

1212571,A3MWYPZBKL1NJ,B001KZOUU0,Jeffery Mingo,"[4, 10]","""The Diary of Anne Frank"" speaks to people across religious identities because the facts have suspense and danger in them.  Here, some brother made a place in the woods where they wanted Russian Jews to live outside of Nazi oppression.  There is an excitement in hearing about how they survived, how they kept their spirits up, how they avoided having too many people know, etc.Do you remember in ""Knocked Up"" when a Jewish character said he liked Spielberg's ""Munich"" because ""the Jews finally fought back!""?  [That's a quote, not my fabrication.]  Well, in this work, ""the Jews fought back"" too.  There are stories of Jewish people killing or beating up Nazis or the Russian gentiles who collaborated with them.  Michel Foucault's ideas about power apply here.Once, Oprah's show said many people, not just Black women, should relate to Toni Morrison's ""The Bluest Eye"" because many people have been told they are worthless due to their ethnic features or weight.  Here too, I was thinking about Quilombo, the runaway slave in Brazil, who started a village outside of Portugal's slave system.  Others may think about Harriet Tubman when watching this.The interviewees are diverse in terms of gender.  At first, I was very shocked that so many of them spoke English fluently, as it's harder for adults to pick up foreign languages.  However, at the end, it's suggested that most of thei interviewees have lived in Brooklyn for decades and they probably picked it up there.",4,This will speak to many viewers.,1238803200,"04 4, 2009",2009,1472,"['Diary', 'Anne', 'Frank', 'people', 'religious', 'identities', 'facts', 'have', 'suspense', 'danger', 'Here', 'brother', 'made', 'place', 'woods', 'where', 'wanted', 'Russian', 'Jews', 'live', 'Nazi', 'oppression', 'excitement', 'hearing', 'how', 'survived', 'how', 'kept', 'spirits', 'up', 'how', 'avoided', 'having', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'know', 'etc.Do', 'remember', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'when', 'Jewish', 'character', 'said', 'liked', 'Spielberg', 'Munich', 'Jews', 'finally', 'fought', 'back', '[', 'quote', 'not', 'fabrication', ']', 'Well', 'work', 'Jews', 'fought', 'back', 'too', 'are', 'stories', 'Jewish', 'people', 'killing', 'beating', 'up', 'Nazis', 'Russian', 'gentiles', 'who', 'collaborated', 'Michel', 'Foucault', 'ideas', 'power', 'apply', 'here.Once', 'Oprah', 'show', 'said', 'many', 'people', 'not', 'just', 'Black', 'women', 'should', 'relate', 'Toni', 'Morrison', 'Bluest', 'Eye', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'been', 'told', 'are', 'worthless', 'due', 'ethnic', 'features', 'weight', 'Here', 'too', 'was', 'thinking', 'Quilombo', 'runaway', 'slave', 'Brazil', 'who', 'started', 'village', 'Portugal', 'slave', 'system', 'Others', 'may', 'think', 'Harriet', 'Tubman', 'when', 'watching', 'this.The', 'interviewees', 'are', 'diverse', 'terms', 'gender', 'first', 'was', 'very', 'shocked', 'so', 'many', 'spoke', 'English', 'fluently', 'harder', 'adults', 'pick', 'up', 'foreign', 'languages', 'However', 'end', 'suggested', 'most', 'thei', 'interviewees', 'have', 'lived', 'Brooklyn', 'decades', 'probably', 'picked', 'up', 'there']",The Bielski Brothers

1212575,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B001KZOUU0,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[9, 10]","(4.75 stars)This History Channel DVD tells the rarely heard of story of how three strong and brave hearted Jewish men, the Bielski brothers, fled the Nazis to seek refuge in the forest near their village in Belorussia. It also tells of how the Bielskis allowed and encouraged any other Jew seeking refuge the right to join them in their forest camp. The documentary flows in chronological order and it is replete with stories from actual survivors of World War II who lived in the Bielski camps, archival film footage, commentaries by children of the Bielski brothers and even some comments by the youngest Bielski brother, Aron.The story is incredible. The Bielski brothers were tough--people all over their region in Belorussia knew of the Bielski brothers because they were THAT tough. When they initially hid in the forest, it was essentially just them. However, word travels; and so eventually more and more Jews risked their lives escaping from ghettos and trains to concentration camps to wander through the forest in the hopes of finding the Bielskis and their camp for refugee Jews. We see the Jewish group also working with Russian partisans against the Germans; and again they were very brave indeed. They did what they had to do to survive; and of course most of the stories we're told are not for very young children.In particular, I loved the comments we get from the children of the Bielski brothers and the survivors who lived in the Jewish refugee camp run by the Bielskis. It's so meaningful and touching; indeed they're frequently so emotional that you'd have to have a heart made of stone not to be moved by it.It may well seem like I've told you too much; but I left out much more so as not to spoil it for you. Believe me, the experience of watching this is extremely powerful and long-lasting; you won't forget this DVD anytime soon.I just wish this ran a little bit longer! The story is fascinating. The DVD comes with no bonus features either; I guess that is a minor disappointment.Overall, The Bielski Brothers is an outstanding installment in The History Channel series and I highly recommend this for anyone who wants to study World War II in general. People who are Jewish or studying Jewish history should get this as well.",5,"captivating story of resistance--EXCELLENT JOB, HISTORY CHANNEL !!!",1245801600,"06 24, 2009",2009,2254,"['4.75', 'stars', 'History', 'Channel', 'DVD', 'rarely', 'heard', 'story', 'how', 'three', 'strong', 'brave', 'hearted', 'Jewish', 'men', 'Bielski', 'brothers', 'fled', 'Nazis', 'seek', 'refuge', 'forest', 'village', 'Belorussia', 'also', 'how', 'Bielskis', 'allowed', 'encouraged', 'other', 'Jew', 'seeking', 'refuge', 'right', 'join', 'forest', 'camp', 'documentary', 'flows', 'chronological', 'order', 'replete', 'stories', 'actual', 'survivors', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'who', 'lived', 'Bielski', 'camps', 'archival', 'film', 'footage', 'commentaries', 'children', 'Bielski', 'brothers', 'even', 'comments', 'youngest', 'Bielski', 'brother', 'Aron.The', 'story', 'incredible', 'Bielski', 'brothers', 'were', 'tough', 'people', 'region', 'Belorussia', 'knew', 'Bielski', 'brothers', 'were', 'THAT', 'tough', 'When', 'initially', 'hid', 'forest', 'was', 'essentially', 'just', 'However', 'word', 'travels', 'so', 'eventually', 'more', 'more', 'Jews', 'risked', 'lives', 'escaping', 'ghettos', 'trains', 'concentration', 'camps', 'wander', 'forest', 'hopes', 'finding', 'Bielskis', 'camp', 'refugee', 'Jews', 'see', 'Jewish', 'group', 'also', 'working', 'Russian', 'partisans', 'Germans', 'again', 'were', 'very', 'brave', 'indeed', 'did', 'what', 'had', 'do', 'survive', 'course', 'most', 'stories', ""'re"", 'told', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'young', 'children.In', 'particular', 'loved', 'comments', 'get', 'children', 'Bielski', 'brothers', 'survivors', 'who', 'lived', 'Jewish', 'refugee', 'camp', 'run', 'Bielskis', 'so', 'meaningful', 'touching', 'indeed', ""'re"", 'frequently', 'so', 'emotional', ""'d"", 'have', 'have', 'heart', 'made', 'stone', 'not', 'be', 'moved', 'it.It', 'may', 'well', 'seem', ""'ve"", 'told', 'too', 'much', 'left', 'out', 'much', 'more', 'so', 'not', 'spoil', 'Believe', 'experience', 'watching', 'extremely', 'powerful', 'long-lasting', 'wo', ""n't"", 'forget', 'DVD', 'anytime', 'soon.I', 'just', 'wish', 'ran', 'little', 'bit', 'longer', 'story', 'fascinating', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'guess', 'minor', 'disappointment.Overall', 'Bielski', 'Brothers', 'outstanding', 'installment', 'History', 'Channel', 'series', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'study', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'general', 'People', 'who', 'are', 'Jewish', 'studying', 'Jewish', 'history', 'should', 'get', 'as', 'well']",The Bielski Brothers

Polish Catholics were targeted by the NKVD and executed or sent to the gulags. However, Jews were generally grasped to the Soviet bosom and frequently were given positions of authority.When Hitler broke the Molotov-Ribbentrop treaaty on June 22. 1941, the Germans invaded the Russian occupied Nowogrodek region where the Bielski family lived and the Jews were treated badly by the Nazis, as the Polish Catholics were badly treated both by the Nazis and the Soviets.In fact, the  Bielski Partisan group did little damage to the German army. They did, however, extort and terrorize the Christian population who were, like the Bielskis, Polish citizens. The murder of 128 Christians in the village of Naliboki is generally understood to have been a Bielski war crime, one of many. The Polish Catholics had formed an underground in 1939, the AK (home army) which actively fought both the Nazi and Soviet invaders at a cost of hundreds of thousands of Catholic lives. It did more damage to the Germans than partisan activities in any other country. At the end of World War II, the Bielski family was allowed to emigrate, and most finally wound up in the USA. Polish Catholics were not allowed to flee to the West but were subjected to 50 years of Soviet occupation, worse even than that of the Nazis.

The numbers grew and against all odds, about 1,200 Jews survived the war in the forest camp. The refugees had to move frequently, being constantly hunted by the Nazis, and though there were casualties, hundreds more survived which is amazing considering the constraints they were under.The documentary features archival records, and also interviews with survivors and the descendants of the Bielskis. This is a must-watch documentary as it tells the story of unsung heroes and more importantly of Jewish resistance against Nazis which was not prevalent during WW II for varying reasons.
