1529056,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B007ATHNLI,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[12, 12]","It's been a while since we've seen comedian Bobcat Goldthwait in front of the camera in any substantial way.  That's a fact that he slyly acknowledges with the title of this new LOL Comedy special shot in Glendale, California.  ""You Don't Look The Same Either"" puts an older (and even more strangely likable) Goldthwait back in front of a live audience, and it's actually quite good to see him!  He's been doing bit roles or directing work primarily in the last few years.  His two features 2006's Sleeping Dog Lies and 2009's World's Greatest Dad, if you've never heard of them, are dark and uncomfortable comedies which may not be wholly successful but show a lot of promise.  I have a particular soft spot for Sleeping Dogs Lie, which has some genuinely surprising realness (and laughs) when dealing with a topic not generally in evidence for mainstream movies!  A candid Goldthwait doesn't dwell too much on his contemporary resume, however, (shout outs to Jimmy Kimmel and Johnny Depp) and mainly sticks to the classic persona that people will recognize.Goldthwait is instantly disarming, admitting that this comedy revival is to help pay the bills.  But he certainly doesn't disappoint long time fans and references his trademark scream, Police Academy, and the notorious Tonight Show debacle throughout the performance.  If I had to pinpoint the principle focus of the set, it is Goldthwait sharing a lot of intimate and embarrassing stories from his career.  There is plenty of name dropping and a number of big names get skewered in the process.  When Goldtwaite speaks from experience (about 75%), he is a winning host.  When he sticks to more traditional jokes (25%), it appealed to me slightly less.  He is fearless and seems to be content to lay it all out, and the concert feels almost cathartic.Goldtwaite sometimes has a tendency, however, to derail his own momentum.  As everything seems a bit ""stream-of-consciousness"" in delivery, he'll often veer off a tangent and start a totally unrelated story in the middle of what he was saying.  Far from being off-putting, though, I found that quite endearing.  Truthfully, I was never a huge Bobcat fan.  But I certainly liked this veteran of the Hollywood Wars who wasn't afraid to dish and make himself look silly in the process.  I really enjoyed ""You Don't Look The Same Either.""  While not exactly the funniest thing I've ever seen, it was like spending time with an old and slightly cracked friend.
