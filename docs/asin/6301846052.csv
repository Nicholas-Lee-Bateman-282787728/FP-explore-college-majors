270768,A199545U14YERT,6301846052,"#1 Kiss Army Soldier ""Ramiro""","[1, 1]","I bought my copy yesterday, I was so excited that I saw from beginning to end. I personally think that Roger Waters is a true genius to have written and directed a masterpiece like such. The best concert you'll ever watch in your lives is this one, it's not only a concert, it's kind of like an opera too, specially on ""The Trial"", there are actors and tenors, the whole thing is just amazing. They also build a wall during the concert. It is amazing. So I think you should buy your copy today because if you are looking for masterpieces, concert and plenty of surprises all mixed together in one, then this is the PERFECT !!! DVD for you to own. If you loved the audio C.D ""The Wall"" from PINK FLOYD, you won't belive the quality and performances by many, many guest stars such as: BRYAN ADAMS, SCORPIONS, VAN MORISON and alot other geniuses too.I'm not saying anything more because I don't want to be ruing the concert for you guys.

270769,A10XJR7CWHNKWU,6301846052,Alan Caylow,"[169, 175]","Saturday, July 21, 1990 is a day I will never forget. Former Pink Floyd member Roger Waters & special guests performed a charity concert of the classic Floyd rock opera, ""The Wall,"" at Potsdamer Platz in Berlin, Germany, to celebrate the tearing down of the Berlin Wall. I just so happened to be in England at the time, and I watched the worldwide broadcast of this staggering rock concert on BBC TV that evening, and it left an impression on me that has never gone away. This phenomenal show was and IS the ultimate in rock theater, and has never been surpassed. Since I never got to see Pink Floyd perform ""The Wall"" live back in 1980, watching the Berlin concert more than made up for that. 13 years later, this landmark concert has finally been released on DVD at last, and it still holds up magnificently. Granted, Pink Floyd themselves had nothing to do with this concert, as Roger Waters was (and still is) not on good terms with his former bandmates, but Roger, the main composer of ""The Wall,"" is in top form in this show, and he alligned himself that evening with some pretty huge names in music---Joni Mitchell, Van Morrison, members of The Band, Bryan Adams, Sinead O'Connor, the Scorpions, Paul Carrack, James Galway, Ute Lemper, as well as 80's staples Cyndi Lauper & Thomas Dolby, and many more. Along with an orchestra & chorus conducted by Michael Kamen---as well as the Marching Band Of The Combined Soviet Forces---Roger & his own Bleeding Heart Band, including guitarists Rick DiFonzo & Snowy White, play this famous rock concept album superbly, and the vocal turns by Roger and all the guest vocalists are marvelous. The production values, including the mammoth Wall itself (reportedly measuring 550 feet wide and 82 feet high), the gargantuan inflatables of the Teacher and Pig characters, the colorful costumes, props, lighting effects, Gerald Scarfe animations and other provocative projections shown on the Wall itself are all absolutely astonishing. And when you see that mighty Wall come crashing down brick by brick at the concert's end, it is one of the most phenomenal sights you will ever see. ""The Wall: Live In Berlin"" is also outstanding in that it is probably the only concert ever staged that is actually *better* to watch on TV than if you had actually been there live. The camerawork throughout is amazing, and takes you places that the live audience couldn't go: into the specially-built living room in the high corner of the Wall as Roger sings ""One Of My Turns"" and ""Don't Leave Me Now,"" behind the Wall as Paul Carrack sings ""Hey You,"" and high atop the Wall as Difonzo & White do their awesome guitar solos on ""Comfortably Numb.""Admittedly, the video version of ""The Wall: Live In Berlin"" has a little bit of touch-up work done on it, or, what is affectionately known in the business as ""cheating."" The power went out early in the show during Ute Lemper's ""The Thin Ice,"" Roger's ""Another Brick In The Wall Part 1,"" and again during Sinead O'Connor's ""Mother,"" so the performances you see of ""The Thin Ice"" & ""Another Brick...Part 1"" were actually shot several hours *after* the concert had ended, and ""Mother"" was taken from footage of the final rehearsal that was done the previous night (Roger's lack of sunglasses during these songs is the giveaway). Also, Ute's portrayal of The Wife during ""The Trial"" sequence was also shot *after* the concert, as the camera malfunctioned during her live performance. But it certainly goes without saying that these touch-up performances were absolutely necessary in order to present the show in it's entirety, and besides, they blend in with the genuine live performances very seamlessly.Following in the footsteps of Pete Townshend, who brought The Who's classic rock opera ""Tommy"" to the Broadway stage, Roger Waters has been working for many years on a ""proper"" theatrical staging of Pink Floyd's ""The Wall."" Whether or not ""The Wall"" ever makes it to Broadway still remains to be seen, but, at the very least, Roger successfully brought the live rendition of the album to the masses in this landmark concert, blessedly recorded for posterity to be enjoyed again and again. ""The Wall: Live In Berlin"" is one of the most sensational rock concerts ever staged, and is a must-own DVD for every fan of this legendary concept album.

There's only one way to describe this concert: Epic!  I can't even imagine the logistics, the planning and practice it must have taken to pull this off.  And that The Scorpions open there in Berlin is appropriate on so many levels - they set the tone for the rest of the show as well.  It's powerful and the sound editing is beautiful.  There are so many elements here I could easily write 2 pages.  There's Broadway play, rock video, rock opera, theatrics, orchestral and chorus....it's mesmerizing. The guest artists make it seamless and the lighting and camerawork focus where they should without that annoying 2 second dizzying, flip flop video crap.  They even manage to work in crowd noise/audio on relevant tracks - and it was a huge crowd.  One of the very few concert DVDs I've watched that I couldn't get up from - I even found myself turning up the volume as the show progressed.

Here's my two cents...Let me start by saying THIS IS ONE GREAT SHOW!!! Rodger Waters as well as his band are just quite simply - PERFECT! Waters has assembled several(now)legendary guests to help perform The Wall in where else but Berlin.... The album is pretty much performed verbatum. FYI, these guests generally only perform one song and this is generally earlier on in the show before Rodger Waters takes over full-time. I have to admit I was a bit skeptical about even renting this because of some of these guests. I have mulled over this DVD and passed on it many times since discovering it's exsistence a couple years ago. Boy was I wrong. This concert really works overall and just keeps getting better and better while building up to a truly amazing finish!  It's impossible to give it justice with mere words. YOU HAVE TO SEE & HEAR THIS! By now, you guys probably already know who's in this. I'm not a big Cindy Laupner fan. She actually does a fine job on this and does so in her own classic Laupner style. It works, somehow..., but it works. And Apparently Rodger was a fan of The Last Waltz, as he invited several members of The Band, as well as some others from that classic concert, to do a couple songs from The Wall album - all in their own unique styles. I'm a big big fan of The Last Waltz and while it's nice to see these guys again, I'd have to say that they are somewhat out of place in this particular venue. They lend a country twang to the song they perform which, in my opinion, is questionable... The most suprising and impressive performance though, would have to be Sinead O'Conner(sp?) singing ""Mother"" w/ a little help from THE Band. Surprisingly, she may just be the best single guest artist of the entire show. I've always found her to be a bit odd..., but she really hits it on this night. It surprised the you know what out of me! Also, The Scorpians do a great job on all the songs they perform. But beyond the guest appearances, Rodger Walters performs & sings most of the songs himself w/ his band. Let me tell you something. This guy is not missing a beat. Everything he does, is spot on and he recreates the songs much like the actual album. He is definately the master of his domain! He, as well as the show and set are very theatrical & animated all at the same time - just as we've come to expect and then some... I may be wrong, but I don't sense any lip synching going on throughout the show other than ""The Trial"" song and I'll give them a free pass on that one - you'll see why...I love David Gilmour's stuff, but quite frankly, this show is done as only Rodger Walter's can do. Dark Side is Gilmour's and The Wall is Waters'. It's a shame they can't be on stage together, but if you've ever watched The Pulse and Rodger's The Wall, you'll see that they don't ""have"" to be. They are each very capable of producing a very satisfying result on their own!Do yourself a favor and at least rent this. Don't pass this gem by. I own it and I'm glad I do. It's a keeper and I love showing & sharing it with others and seeing their reactions.  This is a very very big production. The audio and video quality are very good! I'd be curious to know what this evening ended up costing. For it's time, I wouldn't be surprised if it was among the most expensive single concert productions of it's time.

I must admit that the one thing I truly regret in my life is the one thing I had no control over... I was born in 1987.  I regret it because I missed some of the most incredible times in music history: The Doors, Jimi Hendrix, The Beatles, Woodstock '69, Led Zeppelin, ELP, Pink Floyd, etc...And, of course, this.  I was 3 years old, here, and the only music I knew were the lullabies my Dad would sing to me before I went to sleep at night.I wish I had seen this amazing show live, but I had to settle for the DVD.Now, I have about five different video sources of Pink Floyd's The Wall Live, as well as tons of audio recordings (including the studio album and Is There Anybody Out There).  With the exception of Van Morrison's performance on ""Comfortably Numb,"" this is my favorite version of the show.Now, something I'd like to address:I noticed that, on here and on YouTube comments, a lot of people feel that this was ""over-acted,"" ""over-produced,"" etc.  I think what you all don't get is that The Wall is NOT a concert.  It is NOT something you simply perform with a band on stage.  This is a spectacle, a story, a show... this is a performance.  It is something that would work just as easily on a Broadway stage (and Roger Waters should consider that idea, IMO) as it did with Pink Floyd and as it does here.You can't simply play The Wall live.  You have to perform it.  You have to have scenes and props and actors.  Because that's what The Wall is.I always thought that Pink Floyd's performance would have been even better then it already was (and it was good) with actual actor's, especially during The Trial.  To see that here is an amazing thing.  The sheer power and performance of this piece astounds me.  I admit I thought the Judge on The Trial could have been a lot better, but he wasn't as bad as some people seem to think he was.  And Tim Curry was a great choice for the prosecutor, IMO (if Roger does take The Wall to Broadway, I think he should recast Tim Curry as the Prosecutor).Now, I must admit that I'm a Waters fan.  I was a fan of Gilmour until Floyd broke up.  Then I kind of lost all my respect for him as a person (he thinks Pink Floyd was rubbish!) and I can't stand his solo material (as well as Division Bell and Momentary Lapse of Reason), but I do consider him one of the greatest guitarists of all time and ""Comfortably Numb"" didn't just suffer from Van Morrison's performance, but from the lack of David Gilmour.  What I would have loved to see him play off of Snowy White.  And only David can sing that chorus correctly.That said, at the very least, Roger could have, and should have, gotten somebody other then Van Morrison to do that chorus, because Morrison and those other people all but killed it.However, Roger's performance on the song, and the guitar solo(s) almost make up for it, so they save the song and allow me to give this DVD and show the 5-Star rating it deserves.And finally, the ending.  I admit that I wish they had done ""Outside the Wall"" first, but I love ""The Tide is Turning"" and I'm glad it was performed here.  I also truly believe that Waters should perform ""The Tide is Turning"" at Barack Obama's Inauguration because it would fit perfectly.Over all, I truly enjoyed this performance and consider it the best live performance of The Wall I have ever seen (""Comfortably Numb"" excluded).",5,Amazing!,1225929600,"11 6, 2008",2008,3415,"['Roger', 'Waters', 'Wall', 'Live', 'Berlin', 'was', 'incredible', 'must', 'admit', 'one', 'thing', 'truly', 'regret', 'life', 'one', 'thing', 'had', 'control', 'was', 'born', '1987', 'regret', 'missed', 'most', 'incredible', 'times', 'music', 'history', 'Doors', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'Beatles', 'Woodstock', ""'69"", 'Led', 'Zeppelin', 'ELP', 'Pink', 'Floyd', 'etc', 'course', 'was', '3', 'years', 'old', 'here', 'only', 'music', 'knew', 'were', 'lullabies', 'Dad', 'would', 'sing', 'went', 'sleep', 'night.I', 'wish', 'had', 'seen', 'amazing', 'show', 'live', 'had', 'settle', 'DVD.Now', 'have', 'about', 'five', 'different', 'video', 'sources', 'Pink', 'Floyd', 'Wall', 'Live', 'as', 'well', 'tons', 'audio', 'recordings', 'including', 'studio', 'album', 'Anybody', 'Out', 'exception', 'Van', 'Morrison', 'performance', 'Comfortably', 'Numb', 'favorite', 'version', 'show.Now', 'something', ""'d"", 'like', 'address', 'noticed', 'here', 'YouTube', 'comments', 'lot', 'people', 'feel', 'was', 'over-acted', 'over-produced', 'etc', 'think', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'Wall', 'NOT', 'concert', 'NOT', 'something', 'simply', 'perform', 'band', 'stage', 'spectacle', 'story', 'show', 'performance', 'something', 'would', 'work', 'just', 'easily', 'Broadway', 'stage', 'Roger', 'Waters', 'should', 'consider', 'idea', 'IMO', 'did', 'Pink', 'Floyd', 'here.You', 'ca', ""n't"", 'simply', 'play', 'Wall', 'live', 'have', 'perform', 'have', 'have', 'scenes', 'props', 'actors', 'what', 'Wall', 'is.I', 'always', 'thought', 'Pink', 'Floyd', 'performance', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'better', 'then', 'already', 'was', 'was', 'good', 'actual', 'actor', 'especially', 'Trial', 'see', 'here', 'amazing', 'thing', 'sheer', 'power', 'performance', 'piece', 'admit', 'thought', 'Judge', 'Trial', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'better', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', 'people', 'seem', 'think', 'was', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'was', 'great', 'choice', 'prosecutor', 'IMO', 'Roger', 'take', 'Wall', 'Broadway', 'think', 'should', 'recast', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'Prosecutor', '.Now', 'must', 'admit', ""'m"", 'Waters', 'fan', 'was', 'fan', 'Gilmour', 'Floyd', 'broke', 'up', 'Then', 'kind', 'lost', 'respect', 'person', 'Pink', 'Floyd', 'was', 'rubbish', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'solo', 'material', 'as', 'well', 'Division', 'Bell', 'Momentary', 'Lapse', 'Reason', 'do', 'consider', 'one', 'greatest', 'guitarists', 'time', 'Comfortably', 'Numb', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'suffer', 'Van', 'Morrison', 'performance', 'lack', 'David', 'Gilmour', 'What', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'see', 'play', 'Snowy', 'White', 'only', 'David', 'can', 'sing', 'chorus', 'correctly.That', 'said', 'very', 'least', 'Roger', 'could', 'have', 'should', 'have', 'gotten', 'somebody', 'other', 'then', 'Van', 'Morrison', 'do', 'chorus', 'Morrison', 'other', 'people', 'killed', 'it.However', 'Roger', 'performance', 'song', 'guitar', 'solo', 's', 'almost', 'make', 'up', 'save', 'song', 'allow', 'give', 'DVD', 'show', '5-Star', 'rating', 'finally', 'ending', 'admit', 'wish', 'had', 'done', 'Wall', 'first', 'love', 'Tide', 'Turning', ""'m"", 'glad', 'was', 'performed', 'here', 'also', 'truly', 'believe', 'Waters', 'should', 'perform', 'Tide', 'Turning', 'Barack', 'Obama', 'Inauguration', 'would', 'fit', 'truly', 'enjoyed', 'performance', 'consider', 'best', 'live', 'performance', 'Wall', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Comfortably', 'Numb', 'excluded']",N/A

The only two performances that I didn't care for were Joni Mitchell (Goodbye Blue Sky) and Jerry Hall (Are All These Your Guitars?).

270813,A2HMB1IEBSGSHJ,6301846052,sneaky-sneaky,"[0, 0]","Roger Waters does not muck about.  In the process of creating a rock show he simultaneously pulls off a feat of engineering and artistry right at a central historical crossroads.  Potsdamer Platz was part of no-man's land between East and West Berlin, and had to be excavated to house the enormous show.  In the course of excavations munitions were dug up, and also the bunker where Hitler met his final end.  The appropriateness of the spot, and its time in history, can only be matched by the array of artists who contribute to the show; the notoriously prickly Van Morrison and Sinead O'Conner amongst them.  Roger Waters looks quite casual, but is undoubtably in extreme focus as he orchestrates a parade of musicians offering some of their finest work, Cyndi Lauper with a cracking rendition of ""Another Brick in the Wall"", and Bryan Adams does a great duet with Waters on ""Empty Spaces"" before shredding ""Young Lust.""  Bringing together such a variety of performers, including a shoddy Russian marching band, Tim Curry, and Albert Finney bespeak the technical brilliance of one of the world's premier musicians.Extras include a great documentary with the typically candid Waters, and his description of a crowd they stopped taking money from at about the 260,000 mark, ""and about another hundred thousand came in.""  Waters is left tap dancing to a crowd of over three hundred thousand when the power goes out, but he was typically prepared for his live broadcast to fifty countries, and switched to pre-recorded material for the live broadcast.  So while fans at the show waited about fiteen minutes for it to resume, fans around the world never noticed a thing.",5,As Relevant as Music Ever Gets,1158451200,"09 17, 2006",2006,1668,"['Roger', 'Waters', 'not', 'muck', 'about', 'process', 'creating', 'rock', 'show', 'simultaneously', 'off', 'feat', 'engineering', 'artistry', 'right', 'central', 'historical', 'crossroads', 'Potsdamer', 'Platz', 'was', 'part', 'no-man', 'land', 'East', 'West', 'Berlin', 'had', 'be', 'excavated', 'house', 'enormous', 'show', 'course', 'excavations', 'munitions', 'were', 'dug', 'up', 'also', 'bunker', 'where', 'Hitler', 'met', 'final', 'end', 'appropriateness', 'spot', 'time', 'history', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'matched', 'array', 'artists', 'who', 'contribute', 'show', 'notoriously', 'prickly', 'Van', 'Morrison', 'Sinead', ""O'Conner"", 'amongst', 'Roger', 'Waters', 'quite', 'casual', 'undoubtably', 'extreme', 'focus', 'parade', 'musicians', 'offering', 'finest', 'work', 'Cyndi', 'Lauper', 'cracking', 'rendition', 'Brick', 'Wall', 'Bryan', 'Adams', 'great', 'duet', 'Waters', 'Empty', 'Spaces', 'shredding', 'Young', 'Lust', 'Bringing', 'together', 'variety', 'performers', 'including', 'shoddy', 'Russian', 'marching', 'band', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'technical', 'brilliance', 'one', 'world', 'premier', 'musicians.Extras', 'include', 'great', 'documentary', 'typically', 'candid', 'Waters', 'description', 'crowd', 'stopped', 'taking', 'money', '260,000', 'mark', 'hundred', 'thousand', 'came', 'Waters', 'left', 'tap', 'dancing', 'crowd', 'three', 'hundred', 'thousand', 'when', 'power', 'out', 'was', 'typically', 'prepared', 'live', 'broadcast', 'fifty', 'countries', 'switched', 'pre-recorded', 'material', 'live', 'broadcast', 'So', 'fans', 'show', 'waited', 'fiteen', 'minutes', 'resume', 'fans', 'world', 'never', 'noticed', 'thing']",N/A

Never is this power more poignant than in this story of the mental breakdown of the rock star 'Pink'.  And never is this story more powerful than in this re-release of the live concert at the Berlin wall.  It's not the wonderfully mixed digital sound though, or the enhanced imagery, or even the all super - star cast.  It is the message of breaking down walls, personal walls, political walls, even physical walls.  Roger Waters should be proud that his music, and his message, can transend personal egos, and result in a synergistic moment that was, amazingly, caught on video.  Whew!

270817,A2ITPZOXVR7X6T,6301846052,Vinny,"[25, 30]","True there are some faults with this show, but come on folks, this was one great concert. Read the reviews and you will see how many people contradict one another. The only problem I had was Sinead was barely audible when singing &quot;Mother&quot;. Members of &quot;The Band&quot; singing the  mother's part was good. Roger in concert 7-13-00 at the Garden sings his  part and has the female vocalists sing the mother's part. I like to hear  good artists doing other people's music. The fact that so many major acts  of that time showed up, shows the respect that Roger Waters gets in the  music industry. I feel that they stayed as true to the music as possible.  His band, The Bleeding Heart Band can play this piece as well as Pink Floyd  did. Rick Difonzo plays his guitar almost exactly like Mr. Gilmour. Mr.  Waters still has some of these great musicians in his band today like  Graham Broad, Andy Fairweather Low and Snowy White. Rent the video and if  you don't like it then you don't know a classic show even if it bites you  on your behind. The Scorpions did an excellent job with &quot;In the  Flesh&quot; both parts and I'm not a Scorpions fan. Van Morrison did a very  soulful version of &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot;. The Orchestra was superb,  they probably never preformed in front of such a large audience. Any one  who claims to be a Waters fan or a Pink Floyd fan should enjoy this CD and  the video. I wish this would be released on DVD, then you have the best of  both worlds. Any chance to see Roger Waters in concert no matter what band  he has or music he chooses to perform should jump at the chance. This  concert was an historical event and is a must for any collector of live  shows.",5,Great Concert,964742400,"07 28, 2000",2000,1712,"['are', 'faults', 'show', 'come', 'folks', 'was', 'one', 'great', 'concert', 'Read', 'reviews', 'will', 'see', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'contradict', 'one', 'only', 'problem', 'had', 'was', 'Sinead', 'was', 'barely', 'audible', 'when', 'singing', 'quot', 'Mother', 'quot', 'Members', 'quot', 'Band', 'quot', 'singing', 'mother', 'part', 'was', 'good', 'Roger', 'concert', '7-13-00', 'Garden', 'sings', 'part', 'female', 'vocalists', 'sing', 'mother', 'part', 'like', 'hear', 'good', 'artists', 'doing', 'other', 'people', 'music', 'fact', 'so', 'many', 'major', 'acts', 'time', 'showed', 'up', 'respect', 'Roger', 'Waters', 'music', 'industry', 'feel', 'stayed', 'true', 'music', 'possible', 'band', 'Bleeding', 'Heart', 'Band', 'can', 'play', 'piece', 'as', 'well', 'Pink', 'Floyd', 'did', 'Rick', 'Difonzo', 'guitar', 'almost', 'exactly', 'Mr.', 'Gilmour', 'Mr', 'Waters', 'still', 'great', 'musicians', 'band', 'today', 'Graham', 'Broad', 'Andy', 'Fairweather', 'Low', 'Snowy', 'White', 'Rent', 'video', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'classic', 'show', 'even', 'behind', 'Scorpions', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'quot', 'Flesh', 'quot', 'parts', ""'m"", 'not', 'Scorpions', 'fan', 'Van', 'Morrison', 'did', 'very', 'soulful', 'version', 'quot', 'Comfortably', 'Numb', 'quot', 'Orchestra', 'was', 'superb', 'probably', 'never', 'preformed', 'front', 'such', 'large', 'audience', 'one', 'who', 'be', 'Waters', 'fan', 'Pink', 'Floyd', 'fan', 'should', 'enjoy', 'CD', 'video', 'wish', 'would', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'then', 'have', 'best', 'worlds', 'chance', 'see', 'Roger', 'Waters', 'concert', 'matter', 'what', 'band', 'music', 'perform', 'should', 'jump', 'chance', 'concert', 'was', 'historical', 'event', 'must', 'collector', 'live', 'shows']",N/A
