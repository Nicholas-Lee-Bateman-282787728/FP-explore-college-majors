First Position is one of those rare films which dancers probably won't want to miss and non- dancers could find surprisingly enjoyable. I'm surprised it hasn't received national attention and major press coverage- or has it and I somehow missed it?The director of First Position offers a close- up and intimate portrait of a group of young dancers preparing to compete in an elite (and potentially life changing)  competition and wisely steps back and lets the dancers, their instructors, and parents reveal the details of their lives.It is amazing that some have even had the opportunity to dance. Michaela was adopted from Sierra Leone, miraculously beating the odds to come to America. Joan Sebastian only sees his parents a few times a year because he has to live in New York instead of Columbia to pursue his dreams. One girl is home schooled so there is more time for dance class, a life which seems very isolated but she is so passionate about ballet that she doesn't appear to mind.Until watching this film, I had no idea that ballet could cause so many injuries. Pain is taken for granted.  I winced when I saw the blackened toenails, cuts and bruises which were revealed as the ballet shoes were removed.It was a brilliant decision to reveal the daily lives of these dancers and to ramp up the suspense and reveal unexpected challenges as the competition drew near.

Director Bess Kargman has a ballet background, having once attended the Boston Ballet School. She and her crew meet the young dancers and their families on four continents to find out how they prepare and what the life of an ambitious career-minded young ballet dancer is like. Of course, we get to see them dance too.The dancers who share their experiences are: 11-year-old Aran, son of an American naval physician living in Italy; 14-year-old Michaela, orphaned in Sierra Leone as a small child and adopted by an American family; 17-year-old high school senior Rebecca, who hopes to win a position in a ballet company; 16-year-old Joan Sebastian, a young man from Columbia who was training in New York; and Miko and Jules, 12 and 10-year-old sister and brother from California. Three male and three female dancers, one black, one Latino, two half-Japanese, some home-schooled, some public-schooled. The director may have deliberately chosen a diverse group here, but they are all talented, some exceptionally so.5,000 dancers enter the semi-finals of the Youth America Grand Prix every year, and 300 advance to the finals. We see abridged versions of these 6 dancers' performances, as well as that of a talented young friend of Aran's, Gaya from Israel. (Full footage of the performances are available as bonus features on the DVD.) Kargan also takes care to show the audience the realities of a young dancer's life: the tremendous financial cost to their families, the constant pain and frequent injuries, and the fact that dancers eat a lot. They burn calories like any other athlete in training, and they have to have high energy. ""First Position"" also creates suspense -who will win, what will they get? This is a nicely rounded look at young ballet dancers with great ambition and talent.The DVD (MPI 2012): There are ""Full-length Performances"" of the dances we see in the film, organized into Contemporary (7 dances, 20 min), Classical (7 dances), Additional Performances (6 dances, 11  min) that weren't in the film, and Competitors from Around the World (11 min), which are brief clips of many dancers. ""Training and Rehearsal"" goes into the studio with 5 dancers and their teachers and classmates. There is a trailer (2 min) and a teaser (1 min). And there is an audio commentary with director Bess Kargman, in which she talks about the score, the people -the dancers and their teachers, comments on the stories they tell, why she included what she did, and her choices about framing and reveals.

1539883,A1IPGSKANWKY0U,B007Y6CTSY,"Mrs. Sophie S. Bastas ""sophie's choice""","[2, 3]","This is a wonderful DVD to watch for all those that have budding boys and girls who are interested in the world of  Ballet as it depicts the trials and tribulations of young people from 9 to 19 trying their best to take place in the annual Youth America Grand Prix Competition where successful entrants get awarded scholarships with world leading Ballet companies.For those who don't know what the title of FIRST POSITION means, it is the first steps that young ballet dancers have to learn to get them started in their possible future careers.  I was lucky and privileged enough to work for the Sydney Opera House before it opened in 1973 and I spent nearly 30 years of my life enjoying and learning the world of artistic talents in all fields.My main love of all was ballet, as it is so extremely emotional, colourful and exciting to watch and so I was in seventh heaven, so to speak, for most of my life working as an usherette, witnessing so very many wonderful Ballets and watching visiting world class guest artists  such as Margot Fonteyn, Rudolf Nureyev and Carla Fracci as an example, performing leading roles with The Australian Ballet Company.  It was a great learning adventure for me as I got to know most of our own leading artists who also had the opportunity in becoming visiting artists to many foreign companies thus allowing them to gain elite experiences that they brought back to the Australian Ballet and made it a Ballet company, that can and now does, compete in reputation with the rest of the world. As they are a travelling company, they have thrilled American, Japanese and French and a few other foreign country audiences in past years.  They have also contributed in attaining positions as Artistic Directors of overseas companies as well, so we are all very proud of our company considering that they have just celebrated their 50 years young in existence.Whilst watching FIRST POSITION I was in awe of how many talented young people there are in the world coming to prominence.  In this DVD they highlight 6 of the very best young people from all over the world and walks of life that will make their mark at the end of their scholarships, particularly one, a young lad of 16 from Colombia whose family comes from meagre means, who was chosen by our own Gaileen Stock, who not only was a world class ballerina but was also one of the judges who awarded him the scholarship to dance with the Royal Ballet.These boys and girls have truly chosen one of the most gruelling and difficult professions in life that lies ahead for them and also a very glamorous and very rewarding one, but short lived, as they can only dance till they reach the age of maybe 35, but of course there are exceptions who danced way past that age, such as the great Margot Fonteyn and Rudolf Nureyev who became the world's best dancing couples of their time.  A ballet dancer's normal day starts very early in the morning approximately 8.30 am with classes, followed by rehearsals and then comes the actual performance which finishes most nights at approximately 10.30 pm with extra performances for matinees.I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD and the thrilling performances by the 6 winners, and so I do recommend it for all the Ballet enthusiasts of the world and for their children, to watch and witness the enthusiasm, devotion and the blood, sweat and tears that one must devote one's life, to reach the heights of such ambition.Sophia Bastas",5,FIRST POSITION,1354838400,"12 7, 2012",2012,3446,"['wonderful', 'DVD', 'watch', 'have', 'budding', 'boys', 'girls', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'world', 'Ballet', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'young', 'people', '9', '19', 'trying', 'best', 'take', 'place', 'annual', 'Youth', 'America', 'Grand', 'Prix', 'Competition', 'where', 'successful', 'entrants', 'get', 'awarded', 'scholarships', 'world', 'leading', 'Ballet', 'companies.For', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'title', 'FIRST', 'POSITION', 'first', 'steps', 'young', 'ballet', 'dancers', 'have', 'learn', 'get', 'started', 'possible', 'future', 'careers', 'was', 'lucky', 'privileged', 'enough', 'work', 'Sydney', 'Opera', 'House', 'opened', '1973', 'spent', 'nearly', '30', 'years', 'life', 'enjoying', 'learning', 'world', 'artistic', 'talents', 'fields.My', 'main', 'love', 'was', 'ballet', 'so', 'extremely', 'emotional', 'colourful', 'exciting', 'watch', 'so', 'was', 'seventh', 'heaven', 'so', 'speak', 'most', 'life', 'working', 'usherette', 'witnessing', 'so', 'very', 'many', 'wonderful', 'Ballets', 'watching', 'visiting', 'world', 'class', 'guest', 'artists', 'such', 'Margot', 'Fonteyn', 'Rudolf', 'Nureyev', 'Carla', 'Fracci', 'example', 'performing', 'leading', 'roles', 'Australian', 'Ballet', 'Company', 'was', 'great', 'learning', 'adventure', 'got', 'know', 'most', 'own', 'leading', 'artists', 'who', 'also', 'had', 'opportunity', 'becoming', 'visiting', 'artists', 'many', 'foreign', 'companies', 'thus', 'allowing', 'gain', 'elite', 'experiences', 'brought', 'back', 'Australian', 'Ballet', 'made', 'Ballet', 'company', 'can', 'now', 'compete', 'reputation', 'rest', 'world', 'are', 'travelling', 'company', 'have', 'thrilled', 'American', 'Japanese', 'French', 'few', 'other', 'foreign', 'country', 'audiences', 'past', 'years', 'have', 'also', 'contributed', 'attaining', 'positions', 'Artistic', 'Directors', 'overseas', 'companies', 'well', 'are', 'very', 'proud', 'company', 'considering', 'have', 'just', 'celebrated', '50', 'years', 'young', 'existence.Whilst', 'watching', 'FIRST', 'POSITION', 'was', 'awe', 'how', 'many', 'talented', 'young', 'people', 'are', 'world', 'coming', 'prominence', 'DVD', 'highlight', '6', 'very', 'best', 'young', 'people', 'world', 'walks', 'life', 'will', 'make', 'mark', 'end', 'scholarships', 'particularly', 'one', 'young', 'lad', '16', 'Colombia', 'family', 'meagre', 'means', 'who', 'was', 'chosen', 'own', 'Gaileen', 'Stock', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'world', 'class', 'ballerina', 'was', 'also', 'one', 'judges', 'who', 'awarded', 'scholarship', 'dance', 'Royal', 'Ballet.These', 'boys', 'girls', 'have', 'truly', 'chosen', 'one', 'most', 'gruelling', 'difficult', 'professions', 'life', 'ahead', 'also', 'very', 'glamorous', 'very', 'rewarding', 'one', 'short', 'lived', 'can', 'only', 'dance', 'till', 'reach', 'age', 'maybe', '35', 'course', 'are', 'exceptions', 'who', 'danced', 'way', 'age', 'such', 'great', 'Margot', 'Fonteyn', 'Rudolf', 'Nureyev', 'who', 'became', 'world', 'best', 'dancing', 'couples', 'time', 'ballet', 'dancer', 'normal', 'day', 'very', 'early', 'morning', 'approximately', '8.30', 'am', 'classes', 'followed', 'rehearsals', 'then', 'actual', 'performance', 'most', 'nights', 'approximately', '10.30', 'pm', 'extra', 'performances', 'matinees.I', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'DVD', 'thrilling', 'performances', '6', 'winners', 'so', 'do', 'recommend', 'Ballet', 'enthusiasts', 'world', 'children', 'watch', 'witness', 'enthusiasm', 'devotion', 'blood', 'sweat', 'tears', 'one', 'must', 'devote', 'one', 'life', 'reach', 'heights', 'such', 'ambition.Sophia', 'Bastas']",First Position

A professional ballet dancer is done by age 35 which means dedication at youth and full commitment to ballet, nothing else since there will be nothing else due to what is required to be the best in the business only for few lucky individuals. That truly is a demanding profession especially when you have to punish your body day in and day out to keep it flexible which becomes prone to injuries just like any other professional athlete but in more severe case. The director of this documentary has done a superb job capturing the lives of those individuals who strive their best to be at the top of their game at a age when they are suppose to be just kids having fun with other kids. I am in many sports and very dedicated to my sports and my health and I was certainly humbled watching this documentary. Those kids are so mature for their age and behave not only gracefully on the dance floor, but yet more importantly as a person when having a conversation face to face.

What I loved about this movie is that it really focused on very talented individuals.  The dancing alone was just extraordinary to watch.In addition, the film-makers clearly had an adequate budget to travel around - to Rome, to Colombia, among other places.  This is not a shoestring production; it's done right.Finally, the dancers themselves are just interesting - a girl adopted from Sierra Leone, a young male prodigy, a boy from Colombia trying to be successful to support his family.All in all, I just loved it.
