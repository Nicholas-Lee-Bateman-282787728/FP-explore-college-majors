I recommend to anyone to order/buy this dvd but buy the first season first to see and understand it. It begs the question how long will season three and four be coming out on dvd? I think that its the dvd sales that have made the show stop selling on dvd. So I think that its up to us the fans of the show to write, send email to the production companies to demained or request to have the rest of the season of Caroline on dvd. How come the UK has the complete set (not having the episodes in order) out on dvd without our region not sellin it?",5,"Amazing Second Season, where is the Thrid & fouth season?",1350777600,"10 21, 2012",2012,618,"['just', 'watch', 'season', 'two', 'Caroline', 'City', 'funnier', 'ever', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'order/buy', 'dvd', 'buy', 'first', 'season', 'first', 'see', 'understand', 'question', 'how', 'long', 'will', 'season', 'three', 'four', 'be', 'coming', 'out', 'dvd', 'think', 'dvd', 'sales', 'have', 'made', 'show', 'selling', 'dvd', 'think', 'up', 'fans', 'show', 'write', 'send', 'email', 'production', 'companies', 'demained', 'request', 'have', 'rest', 'season', 'Caroline', 'dvd', 'How', 'come', 'UK', 'complete', 'set', 'not', 'having', 'episodes', 'order', 'out', 'dvd', 'region', 'not', 'sellin']",Caroline in the City: Season 2

The relationships between the characters really blossomed in this season.
