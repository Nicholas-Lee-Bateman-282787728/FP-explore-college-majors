I have thoroughly enjoyed the whole series but will wait for season 6 before watching the color season (7) and hope that season 8 will be not too long in coming so I have the complete season.

1518305,A1UCSWDY9MRISV,B006OS1B8W,RM,"[1, 1]","Where do I start, the tin outer box prevents it from being stored with other DVDs.  The inner box is pressed cardboard, two of the ""pages"" had separated. DVDs are easily scratched if not properly handled, causing skips and picture freezing.  This set stores each DVD in slots in the cardboard.  They can be scratched going in and sliding the out, not to mention the fingerprints you have to put on them in the attempt to remove them.  If you plan on watching them more than once I suggest you provide your own storage cases.The series, however, is pretty good.  The picture quality is fine and so is the sound.
