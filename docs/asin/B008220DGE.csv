So much so, I felt as if Of Mice and Men was unfolding from time to time.  But then when a scene would end, I was thrown into a John Cassavettes film of explosive human emotion.  After that, I couldn't remember what I was watching.  Then they ride a motorcycle and then England and it's over.The large format and ambient light photography preach to high hopes.  The actors are all faultless.  And somewhere in there, there's a great film.  But this isn't it.All the good stuff is on the surface, below that, it's paper thin.  PTA pretty much left anything interesting on the editing floor, or for some other movie.  Essentially, you see what you want to believe in the Master.  So it may work for you or against the film.  But having seen it twice now, I can confirm the following.The photography and lighting are great.The performances are solidThat's it.He really is becoming more and more like Terrence Malick every day which is disappointing because the real Masters write their own book.",2,Jack of all trades.

I watched ""The Master"" for the first time on DVD last week, and I decided to give myself a full seven days before trying to respond to it in a review.  Similar in many ways - and yet ultimately less satisfying - to ""There Will Be Blood,"" Paul Thomas Anderson's newest character study is a complex, emotional portrait of a man lost in the aftermath of war, who makes a series of very poor choices, and in the process, gets sucked into and eventually spat out of a cult not unlike Scientology.There is no real reason for me to like ""The Master,"" and if it were not for the track record of Paul Thomas Anderson, I doubt I would have ever watched it.  It's bleak, confusing, and a bit troubling, yet I have to admit that I like it, to a degree, though it falls short of being compared to ""Boogie Nights"" or ""There Will Be Blood.""  Here's what works - it is beautifully photographed and really captures America in the post-war years with a great deal of detail and mood.  It boasts a wonderful cast, including an actor that I had all but given up on, Joaquin Phoenix.  As much as I love Philip Seymour Hoffman, I do not ever, at any point, understand his character.  And while the brilliant Amy Adams has very little to do during the film's rather bloated 140+ minutes, I enjoyed this change of pace.  Anyone who has seen Amy in her perkier roles will likely be impressed by her morose, domineering presence in this film.  The scene where she rather violently bombards Joaquin Phoenix with a series of sexually explicit language is both memorable and disturbing.In the end, after investing more than two hours of my life into this film, it just did not click.  What begins as a character study of a lost post-war American solider becomes stranger and murkier as it moves along to the point that the ending, if one can call it that, is a complete letdown.  If you're a Paul Thomas Anderson fan already, there is likely something here to appreciate.  I enjoyed aspects of the film, but felt it was too disjointed to love as an entire unit.

I was getting a bit nauseated from his forever odd stares into space that I was supposed to read 'into' somehow, lol. Meanwhile, I had to watch the characters around him act like they're in a different movie when he was holding court. I think Hoffman's character was primarily heavy and cloying, and the other actors acted like dissociated airheads in contrast. This is until Hoffman took off into 'seeming' dream sequences transforming into an airhead himself (some greater meaning for that contrast, I'm sorry I don't get it). I kept mentally nodding-off and tried to keep watching to justify the money I spent. DON'T BOTHER. Horrible! I actually can't stand the sight of Hoffman after seeing this movie. I saw the director/writer's intention to create a holocaust of 'either hate or love it' a mile away (I'm afraid that gambit now weighs in the favor of loathing it).

Yet if you pay attention, even the meandering narrative has a thematic function. Most of the disjointedness between scenes takes place whenever Freddy is in control of his own life, drifting from place to place seemingly at random and with no common thread other than Freddy himself. This is contrasted with how purposefully scenes build upon each other whenever Phillip Seymour Hoffman's character cohabits the screen with Freddy, creating a clear thematic parallel to Freddy's scattered inner life and the Master's plan to gradually build him towards something.Where the movie goes with that arc may not climax anything like Paul Thomas Anderson's previous films, but that's also part of the point PTA is trying to make - that real life doesn't always unfold in the tidy way we expect our Hollywood stories to.* (That said, I'm a hypocrite because if the ending was anywhere near as wildly climactic and entertaining as There Will Be Blood's this would probably have replaced that film as my favorite of all time.)A name to watch - Mihai Malaimare Jr, standing in as cinematographer for Anderson's usual collaborator, Robert Elswit, and somehow outdoing the Oscar winner. It's a shame that so much of the movie is relegated to an ordinary house, because every image shot outside of the confines of that damn window and wall is pure gold, from Freddy lounging on a ship's mast while sailors fling food at him to Freddy sprinting headlong into a field of crops with an angry, drunken mob at his heels.In particular I love how one of my favorite shots - a breezy, elegant glide through a mall as a sales model shows off her wares - is comically juxtaposed with Freddy's decidedly inelegant way of cutting short his date with that same sales model later that evening. That scene captures The Master's appeal in a nutshell - beautiful, bizarre, and driven by one hell of a character.",5,Beautiful. Painful. Frightening.

1544353,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B008220DGE,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","Paul Thomas Anderson is one of those directors that I can't help but respect, even if I don't always respond to his films in the way that I would expect to.  I've seen all of his theatrical offerings and I love the way he pieces his films together.  They are truly `director heavy' films that thrive on his knack for building tension with such visual and visceral flare.  Even when his films don't complete themselves in the way I want them to, Anderson colors so many of his frames with such rich backstory and character development that you can't help but be drawn to the film as a whole.  He's had two masterpieces as far as I'm concerned; `There Will be Blood' and `Boogie Nights', and after that his films run from messy (Punch Drunk Love) to cluttered (Magnolia) to sincere (Hard Eight) and I'd say that `The Master' is certainly sincere, if not a tad messy.  Anderson has so many ideas associated with his films that it takes a really steady hard to reign them all in, and he's managed that before but something about `The Master' feels incomplete, which is sad considering how much brilliance is here.There was a ton of hoopla made over this film before it was even released thanks to the obvious ties to Scientology and the fact that that particular `religion' (if that is what you call it) is all over the media thanks to Tom Cruise, and so there was an almost immediate interest in the film regardless of what camp you are in.  This is where my main issues with the film come in, because I don't feel as though the presence of `The Cause' (the film's version of Scientology) was developed enough.  As far as the character development is concerned, this film is marvelous.  The development of Freddie and Lancaster and even Dodd's wife are all marvelously entangled into the fabric of every frame and for that I was in awe, but `The Cause' itself and the meaning it symbolizes never felt wholly constructed.It felt secondary.The film centers on a relationship that builds between two men who are seemingly very different and yet ultimately very much the same, just at two polar ends of their life journeys.  Freddie Quell is a lost soul, damaged from his time serving in World War II and constantly searching for a place where he feels stable.  Lancaster Dodd has found that place.  Granted, he had to create it himself, but it is a place where he feels important and meaningful and necessary.  As `the master', Dodd heads a movement known as `The Cause' that practices some questionable tactics in the preservation of faith and life and is met with skepticism and downright loathing by some around him.  As his loyal wife notes, he's constantly under attack.  Both of these men are equally lost in their struggles to find worth and yet one of them has self-created a world in which he understands the meaning of life.  Through these men, the desperation to believe in something, anything, which can ground your life, is seen in spades.I chuck a lot of this up to the brilliant dual performances of Joaquin Phoenix and Philip Seymour Hoffman.  I don't think either man has ever been better.  These two performances really anchor this film and play such beautiful compliment to one another.  I'm just in awe of what these men were able to achieve.Philip Seymour Hoffman reigns in his usual antics to create a more internalized and complex portrait of a man trying desperately to compose himself.  I love how you can see in his more dramatic moments that he truly is the more polished version of Freddie Quell.  He was probably once a powder keg, exploding at the lightest brush with resistance, but over time he has built for himself this faade of a life where he is in control and people need him.  His smile, his versing, his steely determination; all fabrications to allude to a life understood when Dodd is obviously just as lost as all his `sheep'.He truly is making it all up as he goes along.Phoenix is a total revelation as Quell.  I'm completely speechless about this performance and yet I really feel as though I need to muster words to express how magnificent he is here.  I instantly call to mind Heath Ledger's performance in `Brokeback Mountain', and then obviously that very Oscar race.  This isn't to say that the two performances are similar in scope but that they are both complete characters created from the ground up but these actors.  Ledger was uncanny as Ennis, creating this man who was so wounded by a backstory never divulged that `every word was a struggle' and it showed.  Phoenix, like Ledger, colors Quell with so much backstory even if it is never uncovered completely.  Each mannered tick and obvious emotional imbalance is beautifully tuned into the core of this man.  The way he talks, the way he forms his words and fights with his own thoughts is miraculously detailed by Phoenix.  His processing scene alone is one of the most engrossing and wrenching movie moments of this year and any other.It's sad that in both of these cases, they lost the Oscar to mimicry.At the end of the day, `The Master' is a riveting experience.  The performances, the score (which is essential to the tone of the film), the cinematography and beautifully etched physicality of the film are all so powerful to witness.  Sadly, the script seems somewhat devoid of a complete thought.  It builds up to an ending that falls slightly short of revolutionary, which is sad considering that explosively rich ending tagged onto `There Will be Blood'.  That isn't to say that Hoffman's song to Quell isn't stirring (could honestly be Hoffman's best scene) but the fact that `The Cause' took such a backseat to all else in the film made the film's conclusion feel underwhelming.That being said, I'd highly recommend one watch this a few more times (myself included) before passing final judgment.",4,Up for processing...,1363564800,"03 18,

1544358,AI37X1O7K72FZ,B008220DGE,Anti-Hipster,"[5, 9]","""The Master"" is beautifully shot and well acted, but it lacks a satisfying climax. The film follows Freddie Quell, a recently discharged WWII vet, as he adapts to civilian life. His unstable personality and stupidity ill-suit him for steady employment, and before long he's on the run for poisoning a co-worker. Now a drifter, he comes across a yacht owned by Lancaster Dodd, a cult leader who takes Freddie in as one of his followers.It is puzzling the way the other characters take to Freddie. He is dim, incoherent and prone to unpredictable fits of rage. And yet, attractive women find him irresistible. He has a brief romance with a gorgeous redhead, makes out with a hot department store employee in a darkroom and gets a busty British chick in the sack merely by gesturing to her. One has to wonder though if Freddie is hallucinating these scenes. Before he is discharged from the military, he is questioned by a superior officer about some psychological issues he had during his service, including a vision of his mother. And there is a later scene where Dodd is singing and dancing in a room full of people, when suddenly all of the women in the room are nude. You never see the women undress; they are just suddenly naked. It is obvious that Freddie suffers from some kind of mental illness, maybe schizophrenia. So I have to wonder if the scenes with him making out with beautiful women weren't also hallucinations. After all, what woman wouldn't consider this guy to be a deranged freak?The nature of Dodd's relationship with Freddie is not clear. They are too unlike to be friends; it is not a student-teacher relationship; it's not exploitative either. Nor is Dodd's cult a surrogate family for Freddie, since no one is really attached to him except for Dodd. At times Dodd seems to use Freddie as a laboratory rat for his therapy techniques, but it is obvious by the end of the film that they have no effect on him. Is this what the film is saying? That Dodd's therapy doesn't work on genuinely disturbed people, and therefore Scientology (on which Dodd's cult is loosely based) is a fraud? In the end Freddie's experiences seem to add up to nothing; his is an aimless tale, and in that sense it is like Paul Thomas Anderson's other movies. ""The Master"" is a finely acted, finely written and beautifully filmed picture, but with no larger message overhanging the plot. Perhaps if Freddie's relationship with Dodd had taught us something, it would have been a great film.",3,A journey to nowhere,1348963200,"09 30, 2012",2012,2485,"['Master', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'well', 'acted', 'satisfying', 'climax', 'film', 'Freddie', 'Quell', 'recently', 'discharged', 'WWII', 'vet', 'civilian', 'life', 'unstable', 'personality', 'stupidity', 'ill-suit', 'steady', 'employment', 'long', 'run', 'poisoning', 'co-worker', 'Now', 'drifter', 'yacht', 'owned', 'Lancaster', 'Dodd', 'cult', 'leader', 'who', 'Freddie', 'one', 'followers.It', 'puzzling', 'way', 'other', 'characters', 'take', 'Freddie', 'dim', 'incoherent', 'prone', 'unpredictable', 'fits', 'rage', 'yet', 'attractive', 'women', 'find', 'irresistible', 'brief', 'romance', 'gorgeous', 'redhead', 'out', 'hot', 'department', 'store', 'employee', 'darkroom', 'busty', 'British', 'chick', 'sack', 'merely', 'gesturing', 'One', 'wonder', 'Freddie', 'hallucinating', 'scenes', 'discharged', 'military', 'questioned', 'superior', 'officer', 'psychological', 'issues', 'had', 'service', 'including', 'vision', 'mother', 'later', 'scene', 'where', 'Dodd', 'singing', 'dancing', 'room', 'full', 'people', 'when', 'suddenly', 'women', 'room', 'are', 'nude', 'never', 'see', 'women', 'undress', 'are', 'just', 'suddenly', 'naked', 'obvious', 'Freddie', 'suffers', 'kind', 'mental', 'illness', 'maybe', 'schizophrenia', 'So', 'have', 'wonder', 'scenes', 'making', 'out', 'beautiful', 'women', 'were', ""n't"", 'also', 'hallucinations', 'what', 'woman', 'would', ""n't"", 'consider', 'guy', 'be', 'deranged', 'freak', 'nature', 'Dodd', 'relationship', 'Freddie', 'not', 'clear', 'are', 'too', 'be', 'friends', 'not', 'student-teacher', 'relationship', 'not', 'exploitative', 'either', 'Dodd', 'cult', 'surrogate', 'family', 'Freddie', 'one', 'really', 'attached', 'Dodd', 'times', 'Dodd', 'use', 'Freddie', 'laboratory', 'rat', 'therapy', 'techniques', 'obvious', 'end', 'film', 'have', 'effect', 'what', 'film', 'saying', 'Dodd', 'therapy', ""n't"", 'work', 'genuinely', 'disturbed', 'people', 'therefore', 'Scientology', 'Dodd', 'cult', 'loosely', 'based', 'fraud', 'end', 'Freddie', 'experiences', 'seem', 'add', 'up', 'nothing', 'aimless', 'tale', 'sense', 'Paul', 'Thomas', 'Anderson', 'other', 'movies', 'Master', 'finely', 'acted', 'finely', 'written', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'picture', 'larger', 'message', 'overhanging', 'plot', 'Perhaps', 'Freddie', 'relationship', 'Dodd', 'had', 'taught', 'something', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'film']",N/A

In fact, the only other movie of his that I've seen is There Will Be Blood. A film that I loved, but can easily see how it's not for everyone, and even I can admit that it's boring at times. I didn't know much about The Master going into it and didn't have any hopes or expectations. The Master kept my interest from the very beginning, which immediately reminded me of There Will Be Blood, complete with Johnny Greenwood's music, and it never dragged on for a second! Then...in the final 30 minutes, I started to wonder where this was all going, because there didn't seem to be much progress happening. The ending didn't help much either.Freddie Quell is a World War 2 veteran who's having a hard time adjusting to post-war society. To say he's an alcoholic is an understatement, and he's obsessed with sex as well. When a doctor gives him a Rorschach test, everything looks like genitalia or an act of sex to Freddie. He works as a photographer at a department store for a little bit, until he gets into a fight while drunk with one of the customers. Then he does farm work, and is literally run out of the place after his booze poisons another worker. Leave it to the alcohol to once again take Freddie somewhere, as one night he stows away onto the yacht of Lancaster Dodd, a writer and the leader of a religious movement known as The Cause. Dodd sees something special in Freddie, and takes a liking to his magical brew. After inviting him to his daughter's wedding, Dodd gives Freddie a test known as Processing and finds out a lot about him, though he never reacts to the secrets Freddie probably up until that point never told anyone. Freddie is in awe and begins to travel with Dodd's group.There Will Be Blood had an incredible performance by Daniel Day-Lewis as Daniel Plainview, a character that was so despicable but too interesting to not want to see more of. Here, we get two characters almost as interesting as Plainview, but with no real payoff. THAT was my big problem with this movie and the sole reason I give it an average rating of 3 stars. I wasn't expecting a big action sequence, a dramatic climax, anything like that to break the movie's feel and pacing. I can't say that the movie was boring for me, because it wasn't. It's just that if you read the plot summary for this movie on any site, even there it sounds like nothing really happens. It's these two main characters going from place to place, doing tests and arguing with one another over and over. Why did so much time have to be spent on tests when we could have learned a lot more about either of the characters? I would have loved to know why Dodd's son feels that Lancaster is making everything up as he goes along. And I was even more interested in the relationship that Freddie had before he left for the war. As much as I did like the tests Freddie went through, there didn't appear to be any reason as to why he was doing it, and more importantly, what exactly it was that Dodd saw in him. I say this jokingly and at the same time I wonder if there's some truth to it- it must have been the booze!I can't go into more detail without spoiling the second half of the movie. Just like in his last movie, Anderson goes with a lot of lengthy shots. The Master's runtime could have been cut down by a good 30 minutes if the guy would have let an editor really do their thing. But I guess it wouldn't be his 'style' then, would it? And for what it's worth, above anything else, I want to thank the makers of this dvd for having it go -directly- to the main menu once you pop it. I haven't seen a movie do that since dvds in the late 90s when the format first started.For those looking for good acting from either lead, The Master delivers that in spades (although I'm curious as to how Amy Adams is praise do much for her role here). For an overall good movie going experience, look elsewhere.

Joaquin Phoenix is a tortured soul returning from the second World War. He was by turns a wild child but you can tell that for all the rebellious nature he exudes, he is relieved of all decisions in the service and comes to realize that it suits him. His mentor is played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman who as the pretentious leader of what he insists is not a cult but a revolutionary way of training people to think. Sound familiar? Amy Adams is the seemingly retiring no questions type but then she is not a women who tolerates indiscretion on the part of her husband. This could have been a movie about corporate America with Hoffman's character as the product.

Much like writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson's last film, There Will Be Blood, The Master is a character driven piece, but The Master moves at a much more languid pace and has a less defined and dramatic conclusion for its two male leads than Blood. Nevertheless, I found The Master an equally compelling film.The Master takes on big subjects like religion/cult, truth, love, acceptance, purpose, and reincarnation. The audience experiences these subjects via the post-WWII relationship between two very interesting, very angry men: Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix). Dodd is a middle-aged author and leader of a growing organization known as The Cause, and Quell is an alcoholic ex-sailor drifting through his life after the war. The performances are gripping, and Anderson does a wonderful job of showing the audience these two men rather than telling us about them.

1544372,A3OXRFCJI67IMN,B008220DGE,Bold Consumer,"[1, 1]","This movie is packed full of disgusting language and behavior. The storyline vividly demonstrates how people who are emotionally vulnerable can be drawn into a group with secrets that will be revealed to them over time. It all looks so innocent at the beginning. Everyone wants to help the new members by allowing them the privilege of mastering mystical 'truths' that only this group has discovered. There is 'The Master' who discovered all these truths and will use his own unconventional teaching methods, sometimes cruel and painful, to teach you these truths that will change as his methods develop.The leader of the organization is a master con artist with the skill of converting emotionally damaged/needy people into his organization and keeping them from leaving. His followers overlook the cult master's own emotional damage and depraved mind as they fall deeper into his methods and become even more emotional unstable. Occasionally someone seems to question just a little bit, but they are soon brought back under control. This is the brilliance of the cult master's power to control people.The characters in 'The Master' are warped, emotionally damaged people who stumbled onto the path of this megalomaniac and his growing organization. The movie was loaded with anything crude, disgusting, and vulgar they could cram into the story. Nothing was left to the imagination.There were no honorable characters, at least none who acted honorably for more than a few seconds, no uplifting ideas or behavior. No happy endings or solutions. There was hope at one point when one of his sons admits that his father just makes this stuff up as he goes along. Somehow though, he is unable to escape. We see him years later doing the tasks his father has assigned to him.There is another incident at a gathering when a man dares to speak up, but that ended badly for him. Other than that incident, there was more emotional abuse than physical violence. There was nothing inspiring or uplifting. There were no escapees from this organization, although we did hear very briefly about some ex-wives somewhere who were out to get him.The actors did a great job of portraying these depraved characters. The actual story line is interesting. The jovial cult master gets his power initially because he has the ability to make each person think they are the most important person in the world to him. He wants to be their best buddy, even at unpleasant times when he is letting them know how it will be for them if they leave the group.If I had known about the language and vulgarity, I would not have selected this movie.",1,It's an Ugly Story with No Redeeming Characteristics That I Could Find,1362268800,"03 3, 2013",2013,2614,"['movie', 'packed', 'full', 'disgusting', 'language', 'behavior', 'storyline', 'vividly', 'how', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'emotionally', 'vulnerable', 'can', 'be', 'drawn', 'group', 'secrets', 'will', 'be', 'revealed', 'over', 'time', 'so', 'innocent', 'beginning', 'Everyone', 'help', 'new', 'members', 'allowing', 'privilege', 'mastering', 'mystical', ""'truths"", 'only', 'group', 'discovered', ""'The"", 'Master', 'who', 'discovered', 'truths', 'will', 'use', 'own', 'unconventional', 'teaching', 'methods', 'sometimes', 'cruel', 'painful', 'teach', 'truths', 'will', 'change', 'methods', 'develop.The', 'leader', 'organization', 'master', 'con', 'artist', 'skill', 'converting', 'emotionally', 'damaged/needy', 'people', 'organization', 'keeping', 'leaving', 'followers', 'overlook', 'cult', 'master', 'own', 'emotional', 'damage', 'depraved', 'mind', 'fall', 'deeper', 'methods', 'become', 'even', 'more', 'emotional', 'unstable', 'Occasionally', 'someone', 'question', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'are', 'soon', 'brought', 'back', 'control', 'brilliance', 'cult', 'master', 'power', 'control', 'people.The', 'characters', ""'The"", 'Master', 'are', 'warped', 'emotionally', 'damaged', 'people', 'who', 'stumbled', 'path', 'megalomaniac', 'growing', 'organization', 'movie', 'was', 'loaded', 'anything', 'crude', 'disgusting', 'vulgar', 'could', 'cram', 'story', 'Nothing', 'was', 'left', 'imagination.There', 'were', 'honorable', 'characters', 'least', 'none', 'who', 'acted', 'honorably', 'more', 'few', 'seconds', 'uplifting', 'ideas', 'behavior', 'happy', 'endings', 'solutions', 'was', 'hope', 'one', 'point', 'when', 'one', 'sons', 'father', 'just', 'stuff', 'up', 'along', 'Somehow', 'unable', 'escape', 'see', 'years', 'later', 'doing', 'tasks', 'father', 'assigned', 'him.There', 'incident', 'gathering', 'when', 'man', 'speak', 'up', 'ended', 'badly', 'Other', 'incident', 'was', 'more', 'emotional', 'abuse', 'physical', 'violence', 'was', 'nothing', 'inspiring', 'uplifting', 'were', 'escapees', 'organization', 'did', 'hear', 'very', 'briefly', 'ex-wives', 'somewhere', 'who', 'were', 'out', 'get', 'him.The', 'actors', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'portraying', 'depraved', 'characters', 'actual', 'story', 'line', 'interesting', 'jovial', 'cult', 'master', 'power', 'initially', 'ability', 'make', 'person', 'think', 'are', 'most', 'important', 'person', 'world', 'be', 'best', 'buddy', 'even', 'unpleasant', 'times', 'when', 'letting', 'know', 'how', 'will', 'be', 'leave', 'group.If', 'had', 'known', 'language', 'vulgarity', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'selected', 'movie']",N/A

1544379,A6WZVL0SRQAPY,B008220DGE,Brian Driver,"[4, 11]","I really wanted to like this film.I'm a fan of director and writer Paul Thomas Anderson, who's had five years since ""There Will Be Blood"" to craft this film.  I absolutely LOVE Joaquin Phoenix and Philip Seymour Hoffman, and am also a fan of Amy Adams and Laura Dern and Rami Malek.  What could go wrong?Well, let me tell you...I was NOT a fan of this film, and it's a real shame.  While the acting was impeccable, the story line went nowhere, leaving me to wonder how a movie that ran so long could have so many holes in it.The opening thrilled me, even though there was much that had to be filled in by the astute viewer.  I didn't mind having to guess at the root of the problems facing anchorless ex-WWII sailor Freddie Quell (Phoenix)--there were enough clues throughout that I think a fair assessment can be made.  But it was how Phoenix displayed those trials through his body and face that floored me: his character is a man so uncomfortable in his own skin that he appears knotted. I will be shocked if he is not Oscar bound.As ""The Master"" of ""The Cause"" Hoffman, too, is at the top of his game, a charlatan who is so skilled with eloquent words and new age concepts that he carries himself like the cock of the walk, ebullient and charming and as smooth as the master salesman he is.  That his cockamamie ""product"" is as flimsy as gauze is beside the point: he tells his ""patients"" that he is helping them trace their souls through ""trillions"" of years of history...yes, TRILLIONS.That he--Lancaster Dodd--has a legion of supporters is not surprising; that he writes books, delivers lectures, travels, gains degrees, etc., etc., is not a mystery... snake oil salesmen would not exist without willing dupes eager to trade sane reason for quick cures.  What is fascinating is the interplay between Quell and  Dodd, both as a factor of the story and as two ""masters"" of their craft doing what they do best.So far, so good, as far as I have explained it.  Yet so much is left out or dropped from this tale that story lines are left hanging.  A minor example occurs in the opening scene in the movie: a shot in which a helmeted Quell peers timidly over a wall.  What that has to do with anything is absolutely unclear, and it is never developed why this navy man is seen as a helmeted soldier in the first place.Another, more telling one: the whole first two-thirds of the movie is wrapped around Quell's rampant alcoholism; yet at one point he is told to stop drinking and then the story line does nothing to detail whether he succeeds or fails.  That his behavior remains erratic is a non-clue: the movie has dwelled heavily on the details of his drinking, and then it is just dropped.There is a scene in which a furious Quell roughs up a person who questions The Master--what happened to that person, and to what extent the person was ""dealt with"" are left completely up to our imagination.  The same occurs again later in the film.  At one point there is a scene in which an important character sends signals that she is interested in an affair with Quell--what became of that, and why it was even included is a mystery.  The same goes for a scene in which Quell apparently imagines all of the women in the Cause naked.  Why is unclear.  One might argue that it is evidence of his intractable nature, but the scene is surprising and awkward and does nothing for storytelling.  Why it occurs there, at that time, seems ludicrous and smacks of sensationalism.There is a scene late in the movie in which Quell--who has run off from The Cause--is tracked down and is told that he must travel to England to see The Master.  Quell does, and appears shortly after in England (though the film does little to convince us that indeed this scene takes place there other than show some children in school uniforms).

At least it went to a worthy talent such as him, but Joaquin's performance in this is absolutely incredible!  I'm not too shocked that he didn't win best actor, but he was certainly deserving of it.  It's an un-Oscar like performance where the hero (maybe the anti-hero?) goes through incredible pain, confusion, turmoil.  He really has a way of understanding and nailing the characters he portrays.  Okay, so most of us knew that his one year ""I'm a rapper now"" stunt was probably baloney, but imagine what it takes to keep that up in public for as long he did.  His diverse characters as seen inGladiator [Blu-ray],Two Lovers [Blu-ray],Walk the Line [Blu-ray],Eight Millimeterand as far back asRusskies... all praise-worthy.  But honestly who really cares that much about the Oscars anyway?With the success ofThere Will Be Blood [Blu-ray], there were high expectations for this film from most.  Supposedly (and likely as depicted in the film) this was heavily based and inspired by Scientology.  When it comes to crazy cults and religions, they all kind of become the same at one point, but this film in particular has many parallels to the Tom Cruise Club.  Imagine a man so knotted up over a lost girlfriend and no direction in life, that he finds solace in a group led by charismatic Philip Seymour Hoffman.  Again, the performance here is brilliant as you truly can empathize with his different emotions.  As his character is written, there isn't much room for interpretation.  We like this character because it's Joaquin.  He doesn't do anything ""bad"" but he's such a passive character it makes it hard to care and understand exactly where the film is leading.  P.T. Anderson takes you on this ride for most of the film, leaving you wondering just what do I want to happen to this guy?  What CAN happen to this guy?  What's likely to happen to this guy?  This is where I feel the film is slightly flawed.  With a masterful array of well orchestrated scenes and an amazing ensemble of talented actors, it's hard to say this is a bad film in any respect... but there is a certain lack of story.  There is a strong theme that is prevalent, but it seems as though the character lacks a ""want"" in the story and accepts life as it unfolds in front of him.  It might not be a bad thing, but it left me curiously wishing there were more to hold onto.Very much a PT film, and it is worth purchase for Joaquin's performance alone.",4,Phoenix vs. Lewis,1361923200,"02 27, 2013",2013,2545,"['was', 'great', 'great', 'hope', 'Joaquin', 'would', 'steal', 'Oscar', 'flying', 'colors', 'went', 'Daniel-Day', 'least', 'went', 'worthy', 'talent', 'such', 'Joaquin', 'performance', 'absolutely', 'incredible', ""'m"", 'not', 'too', 'shocked', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', 'best', 'actor', 'was', 'certainly', 'deserving', 'un-Oscar', 'like', 'performance', 'where', 'hero', 'maybe', 'anti-hero', 'incredible', 'pain', 'confusion', 'turmoil', 'really', 'way', 'understanding', 'nailing', 'characters', 'Okay', 'most', 'knew', 'one', 'year', ""'m"", 'rapper', 'now', 'stunt', 'was', 'probably', 'baloney', 'imagine', 'what', 'keep', 'up', 'public', 'as', 'long', 'did', 'diverse', 'characters', 'seen', 'inGladiator', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'Two', 'Lovers', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'Walk', 'Line', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'Eight', 'Millimeterand', 'far', 'back', 'asRusskies', 'praise-worthy', 'honestly', 'who', 'really', 'much', 'Oscars', 'anyway', 'success', 'ofThere', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'were', 'high', 'expectations', 'film', 'most', 'Supposedly', 'likely', 'depicted', 'film', 'was', 'heavily', 'based', 'inspired', 'Scientology', 'When', 'crazy', 'cults', 'religions', 'kind', 'become', 'same', 'one', 'point', 'film', 'particular', 'many', 'parallels', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Club', 'Imagine', 'man', 'so', 'knotted', 'up', 'lost', 'girlfriend', 'direction', 'life', 'solace', 'group', 'led', 'charismatic', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'Again', 'performance', 'here', 'brilliant', 'truly', 'can', 'empathize', 'different', 'emotions', 'character', 'written', ""n't"", 'much', 'room', 'interpretation', 'character', 'Joaquin', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'bad', 'such', 'passive', 'character', 'hard', 'care', 'understand', 'exactly', 'where', 'film', 'leading', 'P.T', 'Anderson', 'ride', 'most', 'film', 'leaving', 'wondering', 'just', 'what', 'do', 'want', 'happen', 'guy', 'What', 'CAN', 'happen', 'guy', 'What', 'likely', 'happen', 'guy', 'where', 'feel', 'film', 'slightly', 'flawed', 'masterful', 'array', 'well', 'orchestrated', 'scenes', 'amazing', 'ensemble', 'talented', 'actors', 'hard', 'say', 'bad', 'film', 'respect', 'certain', 'lack', 'story', 'strong', 'theme', 'prevalent', 'character', 'want', 'story', 'accepts', 'life', 'front', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'bad', 'thing', 'left', 'curiously', 'wishing', 'were', 'more', 'hold', 'onto.Very', 'much', 'PT', 'film', 'worth', 'purchase', 'Joaquin', 'performance', 'alone']",N/A

Barten,"[2, 8]","This movie makes a big joke about trillions of years, as if anyone betting trillions of anything on the way he thinks should stand corrected. Now that Americans are bombarded with statistics that have already been rolling in the wrong direction to the tune of trillions of dollars, the idea that our energy comes from interactions long before the Earth had cosmic incipience during what has been merely the last ten billion uears, anyone who feels the need for a past that can be so nebulous is subject to ridicule. As a movie, The Master does not take a stand. It offers an invitation:Come back forever.I have been so concerned about differences between England and America that I am aware of books like Ralph Waldo Emerson'sEnglish Traits: A Portrait of 19th Century Englandand Michael Foot'sThe Politics of Paradise: A Vindication of Byron. People in America are likely to view anyone who offers a cure as worse than a fool unsupported by a scholarly team of equals all doing the same thing. For a leader of a cult, the only people likely to agree are the people who think they have come back forever to what they already lack from trillions of years ago. In the movie, the police in Philadelphia arrest Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman) for practicing medicine without a license because he considers delving into the past trillions of years a possible cure for some types of leukemia. Government in America is very protective of professions. As a doctor, Harry Stack Sullivan even seconded the motion to keep Otto Rank from practicing psychoanalysis in the United States because Otto Rank had never been trained as a physician. Laura Dern as Mrs. Sullivan in Philadelphia provides a perfect contrast to American men when it comes to attitudes about who is qualified to say whatever egotistical sublime rumination has revealed about what is wrong.On a totally different cultural level, the character Freddie is treated like Cosima Wagner had an opportunity to lecture Friedrich Nietzsche about how every man who is not completely domesticated is rotten at the core. This may make culture seem like a disaster to those who have been raised on entertainment values, but it also tends to show how Americans were on the verge of retreating 800 years in 1950, when Freddie still has not gone home after serving in World War Two.",4,Laura Dern was a fount of adoration,1348531200,"09 25, 2012",2012,2332,"['movie', 'big', 'joke', 'trillions', 'years', 'anyone', 'betting', 'trillions', 'anything', 'way', 'should', 'stand', 'corrected', 'Now', 'Americans', 'are', 'bombarded', 'statistics', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'rolling', 'wrong', 'direction', 'tune', 'trillions', 'dollars', 'idea', 'energy', 'interactions', 'long', 'Earth', 'had', 'cosmic', 'incipience', 'what', 'been', 'merely', 'last', 'ten', 'billion', 'uears', 'anyone', 'who', 'need', 'past', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'nebulous', 'subject', 'ridicule', 'movie', 'Master', 'not', 'take', 'stand', 'invitation', 'Come', 'back', 'forever.I', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'concerned', 'differences', 'England', 'America', 'am', 'aware', 'books', 'Ralph', 'Waldo', ""Emerson'sEnglish"", 'Portrait', '19th', 'Century', 'Englandand', 'Michael', ""Foot'sThe"", 'Politics', 'Paradise', 'Vindication', 'Byron', 'People', 'America', 'are', 'likely', 'view', 'anyone', 'who', 'cure', 'worse', 'fool', 'unsupported', 'scholarly', 'team', 'equals', 'doing', 'same', 'thing', 'leader', 'cult', 'only', 'people', 'likely', 'agree', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'think', 'have', 'come', 'back', 'forever', 'what', 'already', 'lack', 'trillions', 'years', 'ago', 'movie', 'police', 'Philadelphia', 'arrest', 'Lancaster', 'Dodd', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'practicing', 'medicine', 'license', 'delving', 'past', 'trillions', 'years', 'possible', 'cure', 'types', 'leukemia', 'Government', 'America', 'very', 'protective', 'professions', 'doctor', 'Harry', 'Stack', 'Sullivan', 'even', 'seconded', 'motion', 'keep', 'Otto', 'Rank', 'practicing', 'psychoanalysis', 'United', 'States', 'Otto', 'Rank', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'trained', 'physician', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'Mrs.', 'Sullivan', 'Philadelphia', 'perfect', 'contrast', 'American', 'men', 'when', 'attitudes', 'who', 'qualified', 'say', 'egotistical', 'sublime', 'rumination', 'revealed', 'what', 'wrong.On', 'totally', 'different', 'cultural', 'level', 'character', 'Freddie', 'treated', 'Cosima', 'Wagner', 'had', 'opportunity', 'lecture', 'Friedrich', 'Nietzsche', 'how', 'man', 'who', 'not', 'completely', 'domesticated', 'rotten', 'core', 'may', 'make', 'culture', 'seem', 'disaster', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'raised', 'entertainment', 'values', 'also', 'show', 'how', 'Americans', 'were', 'verge', 'retreating', '800', 'years', '1950', 'when', 'Freddie', 'still', 'not', 'gone', 'home', 'serving', 'World', 'War', 'Two']",N/A

Instead, it came to a sputtering (but merciful) ending that lent little to its excessive and relentless running time.

Many components are excellent, but it has no heart with which to give them life. This was the most disappointing film I have seen at the theater in several years.We love quirky, art-house films.

Since I have no actual knowledge of Scientology I am not coming to this film, as many may, as an expos&eacute; of Scientology, but rather just a film. If you wish to read about what happens in the film check Wikipedia. I'm coming at this another way. More of a  rorschach test interpretation.The Master may grow on me. For now it's a firm 4 star film. I enjoy films that are different and also well made. This is one such film. It's not typical. It takes chances. It is not a straight what you see is what you get film. What's on the surface is just a part of The Master. The poster is a rorschach test and with that I'm quite sure the film is meant to be interpreted, possibly in many ways. First and foremost I view the film as a metaphor for human existence and how we are basically all lost, finding our way, doing the best we can. Form there is is very easy to see where the film is coming from. It's easy to skew that interpretation and apply it to art creation, religion, or even as a mirror for America. Andersons last film, There Will Be Blood I saw very much also as a mirror for America. His films in general seem to analise aspects of the country. Beyond the wide human existence take on the film I specifically see this film pointing a flickering light on the dysfunctional, paranoid, grasping in the dark undercurrent of the way the United States basically operates. Maybe I'm far from the mark but this is a gut reaction of mine. The film needs to be seen again.Freddie Quell, to me, is a representation of any one of us, here in this wacky country, trying to find our way. The master can be seen as the government, constantly changing its mind, and most certainly making it all up as they go. The religion and creation process interpretation can easily fit over this too.It's a good film.

He has a need to find a belief, follow it and convert others to it. he is abaolutely committed to his work, especially the writings of it.jonny greenwood's music plays throughout and really heightens the weirdness of the whole movement,do the religion and its adherents seem abnormally weird? a little but one has to remember that the underpinnings of all organized religion require some out of this physical world leap of belief. we get into the past lives going back trillions of years but the alien aspect of scientology is mentioned only by a sceptic who says earth hasn't been around that long.  that's where scientology gets into the alien Thetans who its adherents need to expell, which reminds me of catholic exorcism, however, writer-director paul thomas anderson is content just to leave that aspect at the trillions of years comment.phoenix, hoffman, and the actor who plays hoffman's wife are all up for the oscar.  phoenix turns in an especially powerful performance of a tortured soul adrift (ironically we picking him up in the closing days of WWII as a sailor in the Navy.)this is a thinking person's movie.  if you are looking for an evening's entertainment, there is NO element of escapist relief to this film, which is rather the point of the whole thing.",5,lives of quiet desperation lived desperately with so few choices,1360108800,"02 6, 2013",2013,2347,"['very', 'sad', 'very', 'true', 'movie', 'even', 'major', 'talent', 'abounding', 'art', 'film', 'i', 'doubt', 'will', 'appeal', 'many', 'aside', 'art', 'house', 'crowd', 'fortunately', 'i', 'am', 'person', 'once', 'lot', 'little', 'going', 'film', 'pare', 'down', 'core', 'desperate', 'need', 'find', 'meaning', 'living', 'life', 'world', 'may', 'have', 'meaning', 'basically', 'have', 'choice', 'can', 'go', 'meaningless', 'route', 'what', 'joaquin', 'phoenix', 'character', 'can', 'carve', 'meaning', 'out', 'way', 'feasible', 'sell', 'ourselves', 'even', 'others', 'such', 'people', 'are', 'rarely', 'convinced', 'only', 'converting', 'specific', 'meaning', 'hence', 'get', 'MASTER', 'played', 'PS', 'Hoffman', 'based', 'LRon', 'Hubbard', 'author', 'DIANETICS', 'founder', 'Scientology.this', 'curious', 'blend', 'belief', 'part', 'psychiatry', 'part', 'religion', 'part', 'science', 'fiction', 'part', 'regression', 'therapy', 'whole', 'heck', 'lot', 'control', 'Hoffman', 'Lester', 'Dodd', 'not', 'con', 'man', 'would', 'be', 'far', 'different', 'movie', 'were', 'need', 'find', 'belief', 'follow', 'convert', 'others', 'abaolutely', 'committed', 'work', 'especially', 'writings', 'it.jonny', 'greenwood', 'music', 'really', 'weirdness', 'whole', 'movement', 'do', 'religion', 'adherents', 'seem', 'abnormally', 'weird', 'little', 'one', 'remember', 'underpinnings', 'organized', 'religion', 'require', 'physical', 'world', 'leap', 'belief', 'get', 'past', 'lives', 'going', 'back', 'trillions', 'years', 'alien', 'aspect', 'scientology', 'mentioned', 'only', 'sceptic', 'who', 'earth', ""n't"", 'been', 'long', 'where', 'scientology', 'alien', 'Thetans', 'who', 'adherents', 'need', 'expell', 'catholic', 'exorcism', 'however', 'writer-director', 'paul', 'thomas', 'anderson', 'content', 'just', 'leave', 'aspect', 'trillions', 'years', 'comment.phoenix', 'hoffman', 'actor', 'who', 'hoffman', 'wife', 'are', 'up', 'oscar', 'phoenix', 'especially', 'powerful', 'performance', 'tortured', 'soul', 'adrift', 'ironically', 'picking', 'up', 'closing', 'days', 'WWII', 'sailor', 'Navy', 'thinking', 'person', 'movie', 'are', 'looking', 'evening', 'entertainment', 'element', 'escapist', 'relief', 'film', 'rather', 'point', 'whole', 'thing']",N/A

1544388,A1N00127IDBHD6,B008220DGE,CConn,"[4, 8]","Admittedly, I'm a bit of a film snob. But I truthfully think most people really don't quite understand what a director actually does. To most, he's like a conductor of an orchastra; yes, we can see him waving his hands about; we know he's important, and we know the orchastra is following his direction, but beyond that, we're kinda clueless. The why's and how's are a bit of a mystery. If you're one of those people, there is no better film and no better director to really SEE the person's impact than The Master, and Paul W.S. Anderson's masterful writing and direction.Unlike most filmmakers, Anderson doesn't structure The Master to rely on its plotting, rather the real intrigue and quality of the film originates from the strong performances by its actors, its compelling characters, and, most importantly, the subtle, complex and downright confounding interaction and progression between those characters.The Master opens with one Freddie Quill, played wonderfully by Joaquin Phoenix. A former World War II sailor, from the beginning we see that Freddie is a particularly vulgar and disturbed individual; a drifter, with an obsession for sex and a tendency to become needlessly and senselessly violent. Then enters Philip Seymour Hoffman's Lancaster Dodds.In many ways, Lancester resolutely contrasts and contradicts Quill's character; whereas one exists as a rudderless, animalistic creature, the other exists as a supposed beacon of sophistication and intelligence. It's a feigned intelligence however, as it's quite obvious that Dodds is little more than a well-disguised con artist, masquerading as a doctor, physician and strangely religious figure to a handful of misguided by enthused followers.Freddie soon finds himself taken under Lancaster's wing and we journey with the two through their bizarre and long-arching relationship with each other. To not spill any of the movie's considerable secrets, this complex symmetry and contract between these two rather troubled characters drive the movie to its ultimate climax.To be perfectly honest, upon initially reading the film's synopsis - and even viewing its trailers - I found myself pretty wholly disinterested in its plot. I mean, what's so interesting about a drifter and a half-hearted approximation of L. Ron Hubbard? Conceptually, I really don't think there is anything. But its in this avenue that Anderson's try mastery of film and human drama really becomes evident.Due to his unique writing style, every scene becomes intriguing in its complex characterization of its performers; slipping only the subtlest of hints behind their motivations and psychologies, and every scene is made downright enthrawling due to the inspired acting of its cast.To say that Phoenix and Hoffman turn in great performances would be a stark understatement; they chew on every line and every syllable of their characters' dialogue, they imbibe a a strange and perplexing physicality into their performances, and ultimately, they give testament to the art and pure entertainment of acting itself.Of course, as already proven by his previous film, There Will Be Blood, Anderson continues to display a masterful hand at cinematography and visual filmmaking and, once again, chooses a brilliant composer to craft a score perfectly suited to the visual and thematic elements of his film.Ultimately, all of these considerable successes culminate in an ending and resolution that, honestly, most will probably find more confusing than rewarding, unfortunately. Requiring multiple viewings (or possibly simply googling &#34;what's the point behind the Master&#34;) to fully understand and appreciate.However, if you're willing to take the time and keep your mind open to the unconventional nature of The Master, I believe, it will very much be a worthwhile, and enlightening effort.",5,As brilliant as it is confounding.,1362009600,"02 28, 2013",2013,3830,"['Admittedly', ""'m"", 'bit', 'film', 'snob', 'truthfully', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'understand', 'what', 'director', 'actually', 'most', 'conductor', 'orchastra', 'yes', 'can', 'see', 'waving', 'hands', 'know', 'important', 'know', 'orchastra', 'following', 'direction', ""'re"", 'kinda', 'clueless', 'why', 'how', ""'s"", 'are', 'bit', 'mystery', ""'re"", 'one', 'people', 'better', 'film', 'better', 'director', 'really', 'SEE', 'person', 'impact', 'Master', 'Paul', 'W.S', 'Anderson', 'masterful', 'writing', 'direction.Unlike', 'most', 'filmmakers', 'Anderson', ""n't"", 'structure', 'Master', 'rely', 'plotting', 'rather', 'real', 'intrigue', 'quality', 'film', 'strong', 'performances', 'actors', 'compelling', 'characters', 'most', 'importantly', 'subtle', 'complex', 'downright', 'confounding', 'interaction', 'progression', 'characters.The', 'Master', 'one', 'Freddie', 'Quill', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'former', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'sailor', 'beginning', 'see', 'Freddie', 'particularly', 'vulgar', 'disturbed', 'individual', 'drifter', 'obsession', 'sex', 'tendency', 'become', 'needlessly', 'senselessly', 'violent', 'Then', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'Lancaster', 'Dodds.In', 'many', 'ways', 'Lancester', 'resolutely', 'Quill', 'character', 'one', 'rudderless', 'animalistic', 'creature', 'other', 'supposed', 'beacon', 'sophistication', 'intelligence', 'feigned', 'intelligence', 'however', 'quite', 'obvious', 'Dodds', 'little', 'more', 'well-disguised', 'con', 'artist', 'masquerading', 'doctor', 'physician', 'strangely', 'religious', 'figure', 'handful', 'misguided', 'enthused', 'followers.Freddie', 'soon', 'taken', 'Lancaster', 'wing', 'journey', 'two', 'bizarre', 'long-arching', 'relationship', 'other', 'not', 'spill', 'movie', 'considerable', 'secrets', 'complex', 'symmetry', 'contract', 'two', 'rather', 'troubled', 'characters', 'drive', 'movie', 'ultimate', 'climax.To', 'be', 'perfectly', 'honest', 'initially', 'reading', 'film', 'synopsis', 'even', 'viewing', 'trailers', 'found', 'pretty', 'wholly', 'disinterested', 'plot', 'mean', 'what', 'so', 'interesting', 'drifter', 'half-hearted', 'approximation', 'L.', 'Ron', 'Hubbard', 'Conceptually', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anything', 'avenue', 'Anderson', 'try', 'mastery', 'film', 'human', 'drama', 'really', 'evident.Due', 'unique', 'writing', 'style', 'scene', 'intriguing', 'complex', 'characterization', 'performers', 'slipping', 'only', 'subtlest', 'hints', 'motivations', 'psychologies', 'scene', 'made', 'downright', 'enthrawling', 'due', 'inspired', 'acting', 'cast.To', 'say', 'Phoenix', 'Hoffman', 'turn', 'great', 'performances', 'would', 'be', 'stark', 'understatement', 'chew', 'line', 'syllable', 'characters', 'dialogue', 'imbibe', 'strange', 'perplexing', 'physicality', 'performances', 'ultimately', 'give', 'testament', 'art', 'pure', 'entertainment', 'acting', 'itself.Of', 'course', 'already', 'proven', 'previous', 'film', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'Anderson', 'display', 'masterful', 'hand', 'cinematography', 'visual', 'filmmaking', 'once', 'again', 'brilliant', 'composer', 'craft', 'score', 'perfectly', 'suited', 'visual', 'thematic', 'elements', 'film.Ultimately', 'considerable', 'successes', 'culminate', 'ending', 'resolution', 'honestly', 'most', 'will', 'probably', 'find', 'more', 'confusing', 'rewarding', 'unfortunately', 'Requiring', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'possibly', 'simply', 'googling', '34', 'what', 'point', 'Master', '34', 'fully', 'understand', 'appreciate.However', ""'re"", 'willing', 'take', 'time', 'keep', 'mind', 'open', 'unconventional', 'nature', 'Master', 'believe', 'will', 'very', 'much', 'be', 'worthwhile', 'enlightening', 'effort']",N/A

(The film didn't quite make back its money at the box office.) The performances of Joaquin Phoenix, Philip Hoffman, and the rest of the cast were outstanding, along with the dialog which seems perfectly suited to its characters. Even the sets of the late 1940's and early 1950's were superb. And there are a number of surprising moments in which you don't know where the story is headed. However, by the film's end, I felt like there was something missing, as if the filmmakers were reluctant to take a risk with the material and say something about their subject through the story. About the last half of the film, the story meanders and never finds again its pace or goal.The film is about the obsession of cult groups which try to answer life's riddles for troubled people. In this case, the group and its leader appear very loosely inspired by Scientology and L. Ron Hubbard, called &#34;the Cause&#34; whose leader is Lancaster Dodd (Hoffman). Although Hoffman plays the title role, the story is really about an ex-naval officer Freddie Quell (Phoenix) who is suffering from PTSD as a result of his involvement in World War II. After the war, he is a lost soul roaming through life with a series of misadventures, such as attacking a customer when he works for a department store as a photographer, or accidentally offering a poisonous drink to a migrant worker.At his lowest point, he wakes up on board some kind of small yacht and meets a strange man, Lancaster Dodd, who informs him he's aboard his ship at Quell's request, although our protagonist can't remember having boarded. Quell learns about Dodd at their first meeting who states &#34;I am a writer, a doctor, a nuclear physicist and a theoretical philosopher, but above all, I am a man, a hopelessly inquisitive man, just like you.&#34; He also says people attack him for his &#34;dangerous&#34; ideas. Slowly, Quell learns that Dodd is head of some kind of an underground movement combining philosophy and pseudo-science and publishes books on some far-fetched ideas which probably have no scientific basis. Dodd is often referred to as simply &#34;Master&#34; by members of this group. Dodd and his group believe the way to &#34;heal&#34; troubled people is by cleansing their souls through a hypnotic process which attempts to heal injuries inflicted during past lives.Probably the most compelling part of the film is the first half, where we as the audience learn about Dodd and the Cause through the eyes of Quell. The most captivating moment is when Dodd is accused of not only illegally accepting a large donation from a philanthropist through a foundation, but practicing medicine without a license. I thought the film would focus on these accusations, but then the film leaves these indictments far behind. Afterwards, the film meanders, a bit like Quell at the beginning. The film becomes an episodic montage of interesting moments which are rather disconnected. By film's end, I didn't feel much more was revealed about Dodd and his Cause than when Quell first joined during the first third of the film.Although all the acting is right on the money including outstanding performances by Hoffman and Phoenix, and the script dialog was absolutely true the characters, the entire film was kind of dissatisfying. We as the audience are given hints of the politics of Dodd and his inner circle but often these ideas are never fully developed. Also, much screen time was devoted to many of the &#34;past life&#34; sessions conducted by Dodd, but I think at some point it became wasted screen time.

I couldn't understand what was great about it, what Paul Thomas Anderson was intending, what the goal was.  Still, through that first watching, I was completely gripped in some strange embrace, and I watched in horror of Joaquin Phoenix's character, not understanding why it seemed to reflect something so deep and so relevant to me.  I gave it a break.  A week later I came back to it, very intrigued to discover what I had missed.  It turned out that I had missed 90% of it in the first watch, as I often do with a really thoughtful film.  I don't mind making a comparison to Kubrick here.  As it turns out, and against my original judgement, this movie exceeds There Will Be Blood in provocation and, to me, in entertainment.  I know this sounds completely disagreeable, after all, TWBB is an ancient relic in film making even though it is new.  No one can really figure out how PT did it :-), unless you are a Master.PT Anderson does his best to reinvent character architypes in his films, and has taken it through the roof.  I think what people miss in the subtly of The Master is what PT did with characters.  There is no hero whatsoever.  There is no villian whatsoever.  There is no idealized character whatsoever.  There is no exaggerated character... whatsoever.  They are all imperfect.  They are all crazy, just like any given human.  In the context of this unprecedented (to my limited film knowlege) approach to characters with a major filmmaker, I could not fathom a more intriguing and unusual approach to character dynamics and story.  Phillip Seymour Hoffman plays a great inspirational figure, but an imperfect one.  He channels great wisdom and glow for others, but cannot manage to face his own petty issues.  This is a famous, or infamous tale in history, and far from one you would think of to make a leading character :-)  Joaquin Phoenix plays the beast within men basically.  Anyone who has ever wandered in dark thought, or has been traumatized, or had their mind partly wrecked by some force or other can relate to this character.  Maybe Sigmund Freud would call him an Id?  (I'm no expert on that).  It was so painful to me to relate to this beast, to see how ugly it is.  And at first glance, I was unimpressed with the performance.  I judged the actor as an addict-type in his personal life, and thought his performance was not all that difficult for him.  Now when see it, I feel the depth and trueness of his performance, and am stunned as can be.  And there cannot be a better performance that Amy Adams has done in her career btw.  Each of the actors in the movie were surely as inspired by the director as they were trying to measure up to the director's previous film, and yeah, they brought this tale to life.Regardless, I believe in owning so few movies, I hardly believe in movies anymore, just not worth the time.  The 3 top new movies in my mind for a month now are Cloud Atlas, Life of Pi and The Master.

1544403,A31YSTICHFYN7O,B008220DGE,"CPR ""xfilebuffyfan""","[5, 6]","PT Anderson is known for his great characters and the actors that portray them.  This film is no different.  I could probably watch Philip Seymour Hoffman speak at an insurance seminar - he's that good.  And Joaquin Phoenix & Amy Adams - they're among my favorites as well.  The cast is among the strongest features of this film.  I think the main thing to stress here is - you either know you're a PT Anderson fan or you're not.  Knowing that in advance will dictate a lot of how much you accept & follow this story.  His style of following the lives of flawed and often unlikeable characters (made likeable) is a staple.  The story itself seems meandering (of course).  Freddie Quell (Phoenix) struggles with living in the world around him after WWII, his desolate journey thus far dominated by mundane daily life, alcohol, violence.  In a chance encounter Freddie finds a mentor (Hoffman) which gives his life more focus & purpose, which is often less than perfect for Freddie.  I can say the story can seem slow or even pointless to those not accustomed to Anderson's style.  On the other hand, much like Freddie Quell's journey this movie takes you through the life of an interesting person - not necessarily a likeable person.  Keep that in mind.

1544404,A26N27LJVQNVI1,B008220DGE,crank,"[6, 9]","Well I guess people who rate this film one star are not the type of people who like to see actors at their best. It at least deserves two for that alone. I do happen to be one of these people and I still feel this film is not quit as mind boggling as others do and beyond that feel it did most things quite right.Dianetics and Scientology are clearly at play here but to what extent I'm not even sure, and nor is it totally clear what is good or bad in the film. PT Anderson seems to mix up a lot of real life events into this film. Hubbard had a lot of Navy experience and lied about a lot of it. He was sexually deviant no doubt. Freddy at times almost seems like another version of Hubbard created to show the differences between Man and Myth. Dianetics was changed or melded into Scientology later on, as Hubbard was worried about losing the rights to Dianetics, and a certain scene kind of reflects this in the film as well, though, this film is definitely no biography more a summary of the events through a different filter. I implore people to give Wikipedia or the like a spin about Hubbard and then watch the film. You might be amazed at all the connections you make.The Master, and any film like it, is going to experience the same exact criticism from the growing number of people who simply cannot watch a film for two hours without a large payoff. I credit all the digital happenings in our lives with leaving a culture unable to grasp the beauty and grace in a vision like this. And it isn't just this film. Many films which leave the viewer to ponder the events rarely set the audiences on fire these days. I honestly did not feel this film was slow at all as opposed to something like Lincoln which at times I felt needed to be edited better.Now this doesn't mean people need to rate this 4 stars or even 3. But 1 to me says a film is worthless, a bottom tier mess with no value. That cannot be further from the case here. I dare say that any supposed cinema lover who can't at least enjoy the spontaneous energy that runs through this film is off their rocker and should stick to Spielberg and the like who give you what you want at face value. Go watch a film you know will have a payoff, a happy ending, a quirky twist and good acting. You know where those films lie.What really gets me is all the people who feel the need to start off their one star reviews with personal anecdotes on how they love cinema and obscure films. It makes me think they don't believe in their review or their intentions are somehow not going to be understood by others. Almost like they are pleading to be heard and followed themselves. And in that voice you know you shouldn't trust them. I think everyone should at least view this film on bluray as it is meant to be seen to make up their own minds about its so called payoffs or not, all in all. Not unlike Malick's Tree of Life film, which in my mind needed two more hours to express all it had going, this one may have been edited almost too much but it certainly has enough going to explain itself unlike the other which simply felt incomplete to me.This is a tough film but obviously not as surreal or hard to crack as Lynch's Inland Empire or something of that sort. Even going into this I knew there wasn't going to be an ending that wrapped things up tidy but I was satisfied. Freddy seems to be the invocation of the rebellious and timeworn human spirit in all its flaws and addictions. The mind is left to wander and question the juxtapositions in the film but I feel they are fairly spot on in many instances at least from my point of view.Pertinent questions still remain of course but they do in all of PT's films. We still in reality don't know all that much about Scientology, where from the film gets a lot of its input. But like all questions we can piece them together to come up with answers we can be satisfied with. I compare this film, at opposite ends, to the masterpiece Inland Empire in that people who go into the film knowing what they want, needing something from this director based on passed appearances, could possibly be heavily disappointed. Time moves on. PT Anderson wants his viewers to think in abstract ways and to make symbolic connections. The party with the guests is HEAVILY dependent on your ability to recognize the symbols and so is the so called sand sculpture bookend with the film. If you can't do this or simply don't want to you might as well stop watching his films. There Will Be Blood and Magnolia were no different.The film is a work of the ensemble in that everyone here helps sell the vision. A true piece of passion that lives and dies by the moment. I had a wonderful time being introduced to these characters and settings and for that a director and cast need to be complimented. Is it my favorite film? No. But I lean towards a 4.5 rating. It's an enigma, unsettling, gracious, and pointed in its ability to keep my attention and make me think for myself at the notions it subtly reveals about human psychology and enterprise.I take one scene in particular to heart. The jailhouse scene where the two male leads are vociferously arguing against each other. How Freddy just for a minute pulls the master into his own world. Where the first and possibly only signs of a crack in the armor of his philosophy show themselves afoot in a world he is still sure of but may not be able to fully control. There is a lot to think about in this one scene away from the film. How people speak of this film as empty is beyond me. It certainly got me thinking about the way Scientology has produced a large swathe of followers. About how different people view time, personality, memory, leadership/friendship, and cults among other ideas.After this scene we are treated to a personal dining room scene with the master and his family and their concerns about Freddy. When he shows up the two male leads are wrestling friendly in the grass. The master is determined not to fail his friends and initiates. But in the end the master himself cannot reach into everyone's life and cannot control them for the sake of being guided and 'bettered'. Scenes like that described bring a smile to my face as they are played perfectly and yet still get you thinking deeply about the characters, about their lives off screen, about what else hides behind the veil, and about how it all might connect to actual people and ideas in reality.Look, I don't need a stop sign in front of me to know I need to stop for a child crossing the street. And I certainly don't want or need a handbook on screen to divulge everything but apparently a lot of people do. What they wanted was an edgier Spielberg type of pic. A Lincoln without the schmaltz and the boredom maybe, although, that film wasn't too bad it certainly was pretty straightforward with a decent ending. Another rather talky film but I didn't have nearly as much fun in that one. This film to me is purely a spectacle. I think it stands on its own. More a character study of the human than a biopic. I find it interesting among the many ideas it shifts and sifts through. It could have been longer even, containing more information about the characters, more detail into its philosophic ruminations, it could have been many things. For what it is I appreciate it. And I for one do not think Daniel Day Lewis deserved the award over Joaquin Phoenix. His portrayal of Freddy is amazing. As good as the former star's role in There Will Be Blood nearly.Anyway you have it this is an easy 4 star film. I am at about a 4.5 here. I have no problem recommending it and quite honestly have no idea why people didn't enjoy this one. All I can say is the attention spans are dull and intellect in this society is thread bare on the whole if this is a one star film. It isn't. Give it a try at least. And for god's sake don't watch a low-res DVD of this film.Note: The bluray hovers around 24Mbps and looks good to my eyes but could be better. A very fine layer of grain and great detail throughout the 2.5 hour runtime.",5,Amazon reviewers are hilarious.,1375056000,"07 29, 2013",2013,8044,"['Well', 'guess', 'people', 'who', 'rate', 'film',

The overhead shots of Freddie (Joaquin Phoenix) sleeping on deck, soldiers slowly walking up a staircase, and those various shots of the clear, blue ocean are just magnificent. The pride and joy comes down to the close-ups during Freddie's conversations with Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman). You not only see Freddie's awkward facial expressions and his mannerisms, but you can almost feel his sickness. You can tell something isn't right with Freddie right from the start, but being that close is like an intimate encounter with him. It's as if you're witnessing a snake eat itself. Seeing Freddie unravel is the bread and butter of ""The Master.""The score may divide its viewers, but it's still phenomenal. More often than not very little music is used during ""informal processing"" or the more heated exchanges and the lack of music lets their impact sink even deeper in your mind and your soul. When it is utilized, it's very 50s inspired. The film begins with a view of the ocean from the back of a boat with only a thunderous use of the score to welcome you. The rest of the score relies on strings, piano, and out of tune clarinets to enhance that uneasy feeling that Freddie always leaves you with. The bluesy undertones of the score fit the film like a glove.The performances are almost overpowering they are so incredible. This is the first film for Joaquin Phoenix after the faux documentary ""I'm Still Here"" and he's as impressive as ever. Freddie is so sex crazed and unpredictable that you can't help but be drawn to him. His alcoholism is out of control as he'll drink any booze within his vicinity in one gulp and his ""potions"" are practically the source of his undoing. The scene where Lancaster Dodd processes him for the first time is perhaps Phoenix's most powerful.Philip Seymour Hoffman is just as brilliant. He's so passionate about his work and his beliefs. His scene with John More (Christopher Evan Welch) where More calls Dodd out for his bizarre use of time travel that claims to cure forms of leukemia is extremely engrossing. And his heated exchange with Freddie in the jail cell is so well done and just amazing over all. Dodd is the only one who likes Freddie and wants to help him, but his desire to help Freddie is also causing Dodd and his family to deteriorate. It's a pretty intense downward spiral that is just spellbinding.Amy Adams seemed a little out of place. It's not that she did a bad job, but her performance doesn't seem to be on par with how strong she was in ""Trouble with the Curve."" It's a character you're not used to seeing her portray and it never really feels like a proper fit, but at the same time it doesn't necessarily take away from the overall message of the film.""The Master"" is not a film; it's a mesmerizing experience. Joaquin Phoenix reaches an entirely different level of greatness with his performance, the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous, and the score is downright incredible.

I loved Anderson's previous film, THERE WILL BE BLOOD, so was even more anxious to see it. It didn't disappoint. Beautifully scripted and directed, THE MASTER also boasts three amazing performances. Joaquin Phoenix's in particular was brilliant, so much so that I wished he'd have received the Best Actor Oscar rather than Daniel Day-Lewis, since Phoenix had to create his character out of whole cloth. Philip Seymour Hoffman is nearly as good as the character somewhat based on L. Ron Hubbard, and Amy Adams is fine as Hoffman's wife. Some of my friends have carped about the film being plotless or formless, with no resolution, but I disagree entirely. The relationship between Phoenix and Hoffman is enough in itself to carry the film, and I thought the ending was perfectly in keeping with we've learned about Phoenix's character.

1544411,A3EXIZWHSNVNME,B008220DGE,"Cynthia ""Andante Cantabile""","[1, 3]","This is an uneven movie.  It stars three of my favorite actors:  Joaquin Phoenix, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Amy Adams.  They all give outstanding performances in ""The Master"".  Joaquin is his quirky self though he's excessively thin and walks with a stoop throughout the movie.  The only time he straightens up is when he's running which he does with abandon, as if hell itself is after him...or the cameraman is a genius or Joaquin's stunt double is very fit.  Joaquin plays Freddie Quell a damaged alcoholic World War II vet who can't find his place in society after the war.  He's violent and unpredictable.  He's unlikable yet who could dislike Joaquin Phoenix?  He somehow makes this misfit a sympathetic character.  There's no way he can make us believe he's a 20 something Navy vet however.Philip Seymour Hoffman plays a megalomaniac cult leader.  He's his creepy self and VERY believable in this role.  Manipulative doesn't even begin to describe him.  Amy Adams plays his wife.  She manipulates through guilt and appeals where Hoffman uses brawn and intimidation to insure their flock's compliance.  I'm not sure how Adams did it but in this movie she manages to play an unpleasant woman without ever raising her voice or having a look of anger on her face.  She remains doe eyed and sincere the entire time.  All the same I wouldn't want to spend Thanksgiving dinner with her character.Though there's a standard disclaimer to negate it this plot reeks of Scientology.  Per the Master the books he writes either cause his readers see God or commit suicide.  He teaches them the influences of past lives.  He sets up challenges for them to prove themselves.  HE lets them know when they've `passed'.I'm still not sure how I feel about this movie.  There's something very compelling about it, perhaps that's attributable to the incredible actors, but it's also overlong and disjointed.  How much manipulation do we need to see?  We get it already.  Whatever you do be sure and watch the `extras' section that is included on this DVD.  It explains some of the vague plot points.I have to note the incredible musical score.  The opening is highlighted with a very unnerving contemporary classical piece by Jonny Greenwood, performed by The Aukso Chamber Orchestra.  I'd never heard it before.  It sets the tone for the entire movie and intermittently is reprised throughout.  It's as jarring and melodic as this story.  There's a wonderful contrast between the above and vintage World War II songs such as ""No Other Love"",  ""You Go to My Head"", ""Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree"", etc.  At one point Hoffman eerily sings ""On a Slow Boat to China"" to Joaquin's character who's at the very end of his fraying tether.  The contrast of sweetness and evil is chilling as are Phoenix's slowly changing facial expressions.  I was also impressed with the cinematography especially the many scenes of the ocean and the desert.To sum up ""The Master"" is disjointed, disturbing and hammers home something most people already know which is that that cults are damaging.  The acting is superb but over the top.  The weirdness factor is off the charts.  The aftermath of World War II wasn't all sweetness.  The musical score is wonderful and the cinematography is excellent.  My mind is reeling wondering what role Joaquin will follow this with.  I hope he still has that foil hat he wore in ""Signs' AND that he puts it on before reading possible scripts for his next project.",3,"Awesome acting, disjointed plot",1362960000,"03 11, 2013",2013,3465,"['uneven', 'movie', 'three', 'favorite', 'actors', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'give', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'Master', 'Joaquin', 'quirky', 'self', 'excessively', 'thin', 'walks', 'stoop', 'movie', 'only', 'time', 'up', 'when', 'running', 'abandon', 'hell', 'cameraman', 'genius', 'Joaquin', 'stunt', 'double', 'very', 'fit', 'Joaquin', 'Freddie', 'Quell', 'damaged', 'alcoholic', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'vet', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'place', 'society', 'war', 'violent', 'unpredictable', 'unlikable', 'yet', 'who', 'could', 'dislike', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'somehow', 'misfit', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'way', 'can', 'make', 'believe', '20', 'something', 'Navy', 'vet', 'however.Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'megalomaniac', 'cult', 'leader', 'creepy', 'self', 'VERY', 'believable', 'role', 'Manipulative', ""n't"", 'even', 'begin', 'describe', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'wife', 'guilt', 'appeals', 'where', 'Hoffman', 'brawn', 'intimidation', 'insure', 'flock', 'compliance', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'Adams', 'did', 'movie', 'play', 'unpleasant', 'woman', 'ever', 'raising', 'voice', 'having', 'look', 'anger', 'face', 'doe', 'eyed', 'sincere', 'entire', 'time', 'same', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'spend', 'Thanksgiving', 'dinner', 'character.Though', 'standard', 'disclaimer', 'negate', 'plot', 'reeks', 'Scientology', 'Master', 'books', 'cause', 'readers', 'see', 'God', 'commit', 'suicide', 'influences', 'past', 'lives', 'up', 'challenges', 'prove', 'HE', 'know', 'when', ""'ve"", ""passed'.I"", ""'m"", 'still', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'feel', 'movie', 'something', 'very', 'compelling', 'perhaps', 'attributable', 'incredible', 'actors', 'also', 'overlong', 'disjointed', 'How', 'much', 'manipulation', 'do', 'need', 'see', 'get', 'already', 'do', 'be', 'sure', 'watch', 'extras', 'section', 'included', 'DVD', 'vague', 'plot', 'points.I', 'have', 'note', 'incredible', 'musical', 'score', 'opening', 'highlighted', 'very', 'unnerving', 'contemporary', 'classical', 'piece', 'Jonny', 'Greenwood', 'performed', 'Aukso', 'Chamber', 'Orchestra', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'tone', 'entire', 'movie', 'intermittently', 'reprised', 'jarring', 'melodic', 'story', 'wonderful', 'contrast', 'above', 'vintage', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'songs', 'such', 'No', 'Other', 'Love', 'Go', 'Head', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Sit', 'Apple', 'Tree', 'etc', 'one', 'point', 'Hoffman', 'eerily', 'Slow', 'Boat', 'China', 'Joaquin', 'character', 'who', 'very', 'end', 'fraying', 'tether', 'contrast', 'sweetness', 'evil', 'chilling', 'are', 'Phoenix', 'slowly', 'changing', 'facial', 'expressions', 'was', 'also', 'impressed', 'cinematography', 'especially', 'many', 'scenes', 'ocean', 'desert.To', 'sum', 'up', 'Master', 'disjointed', 'disturbing', 'hammers', 'home', 'something', 'most', 'people', 'already', 'know', 'cults', 'are', 'damaging', 'acting', 'superb', 'top', 'weirdness', 'factor', 'charts', 'aftermath', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'was', ""n't"", 'sweetness', 'musical', 'score', 'wonderful', 'cinematography', 'excellent', 'mind', 'reeling', 'wondering', 'what', 'role', 'Joaquin', 'will', 'follow', 'hope', 'still', 'foil', 'hat', 'wore', 'Signs', 'reading', 'possible', 'scripts', 'next', 'project']",N/A

Drunk one night, he wanders aboard a boat mastered by the personable Lancaster Dodd, a man who has slowly gathered around him a tightly knit group of people.  Dodd's goals are lofty: to cure the world of everything he sees wrong with it, one individual person at a time.  Sensing a guiding light, Freddy latches onto Dodd much like a dog--loyal and eager, but feral at heart and ultimately unpredictable.THE MASTER is an actor's piece.  As usual, Joaquin Phoenix gives it his all; his performances can often be polarizing--sometimes he goes too far--but here, he shines.  Matching him step for step is Philip Seymour Hoffman; where Phoenix is over-the-top and theatrical, Hoffman keeps his performance subtle.  It's a perfect counterbalance, and the chemistry between the two is at times purposely unsettling.  Digging into their meager roles are the supporting cast: Amy Adams, Jesse Plemons, Laura Dern, and others, who rarely have much to do, though Adams gets a couple of moments to shine (enough to get her an Oscar nom).There's probably a reason the film's three Oscar nominations were for acting.  The script and directing are solid--make no mistake, this is a Paul Thomas Anderson film, and you're going to get something superbly put together.  But the film meanders; the central performances are never less than riveting, but the story takes a backseat somewhere along the way.  What made Anderson's previous efforts so successful was that they were character studies with flow and rhythm; here, we simply have a dual character study.  It's interesting, and it's rendered beautifully, but it's slow going.  If you can set aside a couple of hours (that will probably feel like a couple of hours), then you owe it to yourself to give THE MASTER a shot.  It's not a film about cultism, as has been feared; rather, it's a film about people, one that never passes judgment.  Some viewers will be a little unsettled by Anderson's ambiguity; most, hopefully, will appreciate a great filmmaker taking a stab at rendering his perceptions of humanity onto the screen.",4,A ponderous but thoughtful film.,1361836800,"02 26, 2013",2013,2404,"['Paul', 'Thomas', 'Anderson', 'master', 'pun', 'intended', 'slow-burner', 'Usually', 'off', 'MAGNOLIA', 'THERE', 'WILL', 'BE', 'BLOOD', 'are', 'true', 'wonders', 'filmmaking', 'other', 'times', 'such', 'THE', 'MASTER', 'technique', 'bit', 'uneven', 'film', 'WWII', 'vet', 'Freddy', 'driftless', 'sort', 'cast', 'ashore', 'world', ""n't"", 'quite', 'fit', 'Drunk', 'one', 'night', 'boat', 'mastered', 'personable', 'Lancaster', 'Dodd', 'man', 'who', 'slowly', 'gathered', 'tightly', 'knit', 'group', 'people', 'Dodd', 'goals', 'are', 'lofty', 'cure', 'world', 'everything', 'wrong', 'one', 'individual', 'person', 'time', 'Sensing', 'guiding', 'light', 'Freddy', 'Dodd', 'much', 'dog', 'loyal', 'eager', 'feral', 'heart', 'ultimately', 'unpredictable.THE', 'MASTER', 'actor', 'piece', 'usual', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'performances', 'can', 'often', 'be', 'polarizing', 'sometimes', 'too', 'far', 'here', 'Matching', 'step', 'step', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'where', 'Phoenix', 'over-the-top', 'theatrical', 'Hoffman', 'performance', 'subtle', 'perfect', 'counterbalance', 'chemistry', 'two', 'times', 'purposely', 'unsettling', 'Digging', 'meager', 'roles', 'are', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'Jesse', 'Plemons', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'others', 'who', 'rarely', 'have', 'much', 'do', 'Adams', 'couple', 'moments', 'shine', 'enough', 'get', 'Oscar', 'nom', 'probably', 'reason', 'film', 'three', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'were', 'acting', 'script', 'directing', 'are', 'solid', 'make', 'mistake', 'Paul', 'Thomas', 'Anderson', 'film', ""'re"", 'going', 'get', 'something', 'superbly', 'put', 'together', 'film', 'meanders', 'central', 'performances', 'are', 'never', 'less', 'riveting', 'story', 'backseat', 'somewhere', 'way', 'What', 'made', 'Anderson', 'previous', 'efforts', 'so', 'successful', 'was', 'were', 'character', 'studies', 'flow', 'rhythm', 'here', 'simply', 'have', 'dual', 'character', 'study', 'interesting', 'rendered', 'beautifully', 'slow', 'going', 'can', 'set', 'aside', 'couple', 'hours', 'will', 'probably', 'feel', 'couple', 'hours', 'then', 'owe', 'give', 'THE', 'MASTER', 'shot', 'not', 'film', 'cultism', 'been', 'feared', 'rather', 'film', 'people', 'one', 'never', 'judgment', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'little', 'unsettled', 'Anderson', 'ambiguity', 'most', 'hopefully', 'will', 'appreciate', 'great', 'filmmaker', 'taking', 'stab', 'rendering', 'perceptions', 'humanity', 'screen']",N/A

1544417,A2FEJIORC1MBG3,B008220DGE,D. Hartley,"[6, 7]","""Comparisons are not invariably odious, but they are often misleading,"" Orson Welles once wrote, in reference to the long-running debate over whether or not the many parallels in his film ""Citizen Kane"" to the real life story of William Randolph Hearst and the rise of his powerful publishing empire were purely coincidental. It is quite possible that current and future generations of critics and audiences will engage in similar debate regarding the parallels in writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson's latest film, ""The Master to the real life story of L. Ron Hubbard and the founding of his Church of Scientology.Despite a number of ""coincidences"", the answer to the most obvious question is, ""no"". This is neither a hagiography nor a smack down of any specific doyen or belief system (thinly disguised or otherwise). Anyone who would pigeonhole the film with such a shallow reading likely has not seen it (or is perhaps unfamiliar with certain prevalent themes running through all of PTA's previous films). What he has crafted is a thought-provoking and startlingly original examination of why human beings in general are so prone to kowtow to a burning bush, or an emperor with no clothes.  Is it a spiritual need? Is it an emotional need? Or...is it purely a lizard brain response, embedded in our DNA?As Inspector Clouseau once ruminated, ""Well you know, there are leaders...and there are followers."" At its most rudimentary level, ""The Master"" is a two-character study about a leader and a follower (and metaphorically, all leaders and followers. Anderson frames his narrative using the zeitgeist of America's existential post-WW2 malaise, in the person of ex-sailor Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix). Socially withdrawn, prone to dipsomania, odd sexual compulsions and unpredictable fits of rage, Freddie's transition back to civilian life has not been a smooth one. In fact, the character of Freddy strongly recalls the archetypal ""disillusioned vet"" protagonist who pops up time and again throughout the classic film noir cycle of the 1940s and 1950s.Freddie's laundry list of personality disorders has not endeared him to the 5 o'clock world; he drifts from job to job. Headed for a meltdown, Freddy skulks in the shadows of a San Francisco marina, where he crashes a shipboard wedding party, hoping to stow away. It turns out that the ship is captained by the father of the bride, Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman). Dodd is a self-described writer/doctor/nuclear physicist/ philosopher and ""...a hopelessly inquisitive man.""  He is also a burgeoning cult leader; the boat is chock-a-block with devotees in thrall with Dodd and his philosophy, referred to as ""The Cause"".Initially, the paranoid Dodd admonishes his uninvited guest, suspecting him to be some manner of government spook assigned to infiltrate his organization; but instead of giving him the heave-ho, ""something"" compels him to do a sudden 180 and invite the twitchy and troubled Freddie along for an imminent (Homeric?) ocean voyage with his family and followers to New York. And so begins the life-altering relationship between the two men, which vacillates tenuously between master/servant, mentor/apprentice, and father/son (the latter recalling Philip Baker Hall and John C. Reilly in ""Hard Eight"", Burt Reynolds and Mark Wahlberg in ""Boogie Nights"", Tom Cruise and Jason Robards in ""Magnolia"", and Daniel Day-Lewis and Dillon Freasier/Paul Dano in ""There Will Be Blood"").Not to denigrate Hoffman, who is mesmerizing as always; nor fine supporting performances from the likes of Amy Adams (as Dodd's subtly controlling wife, who plays a sort of shrewd Livia to his mercurial Augustus) or Laura Dern,but Phoenix achieves an Oscar-worthy transformation. I don't know if this was by accident or by design, but I swear he is channeling Montgomery Clift, not only replicating his acting tics and vocal inflection, but his physicality (right down to the hunched shoulders and sunken chest-it is downright eerie).The film is beautifully shot in 65mm by DP Mihai Malainare, Jr., and nicely scored by Jonny Greenwood.

Not because of its cinematography, sharp writing, or superb performances, but simple because I don't know what this film is suppose to be about. Or perhaps is simply isn't about what I want(ed) it to be about. It feels like Paul Thomas Anderson (a director whose work I appreciate immensely) wanted to make a movie about a broken, listless World War II veteran and take a fictional stab at the founding of Scientology. And yet, he wasn't brave enough to commit to either. Could Freddie (Joaquin Phoenix) been a cipher for so many returning Veteran's facing the(then little understood) effects of PTSD? Yes, but he really wasn't. He was personally self destructive. Could he have been indicative of the lost souls attracted to ""Cult"" like personalities as embodied by the Master (Phillip Seymour Hoffman)? Yes, but he really wasn't because even he finds shallow fleeting comfort in ""The Cause,"" P.T. Anderson's stand in for Scientology. Perhaps it finds soft purchase thematically because Anderson doesn't want to alienate the Hollywood Elite enamored with utterly ridiculous Church of Scientology. Or perhaps he told the story exactly as he wanted to and it failed to resonate with me. Of note is Phoenix's complete physical transformation. Have you ever seen someone coming in shadow and recognized them because of posture and gait? Imagine reshaping your own dramatically. Phoenix does this.

Although the conclusion of ""The Master"" is certainly less ominous than that which is affixed to ""A Serious Man"", the results will certainly be no less polarizing. For those looking for something similar to ""There Will Be Blood"", I would say that ""The Master"" is slightly less accessible to audiences but full of the same bravado performances (particularly from Phoenix and Hoffman, who amaze) and photographed every bit as spectacularly by cinematographer Robert Elswit (who was robbed of an Oscar nomination this year). ""The Master"" tells of a drifter with post-WWII PTSD symptoms who wanders onto a ship occupied by a religious ""cult"" led by The Master aka Phillip Seymour Hoffman. The rest of the film serves to focus on the relationship between Hoffman and his protege Phoenix, who struggles to fit that billing and who teeters between past regrets, love for the Master and his religion, and ultimately the defiance.

1544424,A280GY5UVUS2QH,B008220DGE,Doug Anderson,"[180, 224]","This is a film about people searching desperately for a key to unlock the secrets of existence. And it focuses on two characters: one who can find no such key and one who convinces himself and others that he has found such a key. The former is Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix) who we first meet on an unnamed beach in the South Pacific during the last days of WW11 and who we follow for some time as he unsuccessfully struggles to quell internal turmoil and establish some semblance of normalcy in post-War America; and the latter is Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman) who is also battling unnamed dragons but who seems to have found some form of inner peace as the leader of an order/cult that promises members that human perfection is achievable in this lifetime if members allow themselves to be unlocked by Lancaster Dodd's magic key (which he calls processing). When Quell stows away on Dodd's yacht the two seem to recognize some common quality in each other. Dodd takes an interest in Quell's curious life, and as Quell learns more about Dodd's methods so do we. Processing is essentially psychoanalytic questioning that seeks to help members identify and neutralize past traumas so that they can eliminate negativity from their present lives and achieve that hoped for perfection. Its psychoanalysis but its psychoanalysis with a difference, the difference being that members are encouraged not only to recall past experiences but also to recall past lives. A lot has been made of the fact that this philosophy is loosely based on L. Ron Hubbards Scientology, but the film is less interested in the specifics of the actual philosophy than in the need of its followers to believe in something. This desperation to believe in something, however outlandish, is what interests PT Anderson (and what will resonate with audiences). This film is as intense as they come but its long and is not as consistently entertaining as the directors previous work (although for all of the reasons just mentioned it is his most ambitious and interesting). Its most powerful moments come when Dodd plays psychoanalytical father to lost pupil Quell. Quell's desperation and Dodd's need to dominate his pupil is palpable in these scenes that are unlike any I've seen in an American film. Quell's need to accept Dodd as a father figure is matched by an equal need to reject him as  a guru. We're not asked to accept Quell as any kind of hero, just as an eternally lost soul. Freddie Quell, an existentially lost man for whom there are no answers, stands as the perfect antithesis to Lancaster Dodd, the man who refuses to live in a world where there are no answers (even if this means that he himself must invent those answers as he goes along). This is as existential as American filmmaking gets. There Will Be Blood may have wider appeal because it is about something all Americans can relate to, Greed. This film is about something fewer Americans will connect with: the meaninglessness of existence (or at least the difficulties of living without any existential certainties). This film is two hours long and there are no obvious payoffs, and some may hold PT Anderson accountable for the fact that there are no transcendent truths in The Master. But that is what makes this film so unusual and so daring.",5,"PT Anderson, an American Beckett",1348272000,"09 22, 2012",2012,3299,"['film', 'people', 'searching', 'desperately', 'key', 'unlock', 'secrets', 'existence', 'two', 'characters', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'find', 'such', 'key', 'one', 'who', 'others', 'found', 'key', 'former', 'Freddie', 'Quell', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'who', 'first', 'meet', 'unnamed', 'beach', 'South', 'Pacific', 'last', 'days', 'WW11', 'who', 'follow', 'time', 'unsuccessfully', 'quell', 'internal', 'turmoil', 'establish', 'semblance', 'normalcy', 'post-War', 'America', 'latter', 'Lancaster', 'Dodd', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'who', 'also', 'battling', 'unnamed', 'dragons', 'who', 'have', 'found', 'form', 'inner', 'peace', 'leader', 'order/cult', 'members', 'human', 'perfection', 'achievable', 'lifetime', 'members', 'allow', 'be', 'unlocked', 'Lancaster', 'Dodd', 'magic', 'key', 'processing', 'When', 'Quell', 'away', 'Dodd', 'two', 'seem', 'recognize', 'common', 'quality', 'other', 'Dodd', 'interest', 'Quell', 'curious', 'life', 'Quell', 'more', 'Dodd', 'methods', 'so', 'do', 'Processing', 'essentially', 'psychoanalytic', 'questioning', 'help', 'members', 'identify', 'neutralize', 'past', 'traumas', 'can', 'eliminate', 'negativity', 'present', 'lives', 'achieve', 'hoped', 'perfection', 'psychoanalysis', 'psychoanalysis', 'difference', 'difference', 'being', 'members', 'are', 'encouraged', 'not', 'only', 'recall', 'past', 'experiences', 'also', 'recall', 'past', 'lives', 'lot', 'been', 'made', 'fact', 'philosophy', 'loosely', 'based', 'L.', 'Ron', 'Hubbards', 'Scientology', 'film', 'less', 'interested', 'specifics', 'actual', 'philosophy', 'need', 'followers', 'believe', 'something', 'desperation', 'believe', 'something', 'however', 'outlandish', 'what', 'interests', 'PT', 'Anderson', 'what', 'will', 'resonate', 'audiences', 'film', 'as', 'intense', 'come', 'long', 'not', 'as', 'consistently', 'entertaining', 'directors', 'previous', 'work', 'reasons', 'just', 'mentioned', 'most', 'ambitious', 'interesting', 'most', 'powerful', 'moments', 'come', 'when', 'Dodd', 'psychoanalytical', 'father', 'lost', 'pupil', 'Quell', 'Quell', 'desperation', 'Dodd', 'need', 'dominate', 'pupil', 'palpable', 'scenes', 'are', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'American', 'film', 'Quell', 'need', 'accept', 'Dodd', 'father', 'figure', 'matched', 'equal', 'need', 'reject', 'guru', ""'re"", 'not', 'asked', 'accept', 'Quell', 'kind', 'hero', 'just', 'eternally', 'lost', 'soul', 'Freddie', 'Quell', 'existentially', 'lost', 'man', 'whom', 'are', 'answers', 'perfect', 'antithesis', 'Lancaster', 'Dodd', 'man', 'who', 'live', 'world', 'where', 'are', 'answers', 'even', 'must', 'invent', 'answers', 'along', 'as', 'existential', 'American', 'filmmaking', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'may', 'have', 'wider', 'appeal', 'something', 'Americans', 'can', 'relate', 'Greed', 'film', 'something', 'fewer', 'Americans', 'will', 'connect', 'meaninglessness', 'existence', 'least', 'difficulties', 'living', 'existential', 'certainties', 'film', 'two', 'hours', 'long', 'are', 'obvious', 'payoffs', 'may', 'hold', 'PT', 'Anderson', 'accountable', 'fact', 'are', 'transcendent', 'truths', 'Master', 'what', 'film', 'so', 'unusual', 'so', 'daring']",N/A

It's one to analyze and does not work terribly well as straight entertainment, so I can understand many people's reasons for disliking it. As my rating indicates, I like it a good bit even though I wish it had a more cohesive plot. This film combines a 1950s style, mood, setting, and soundtrack with expertly modern cinemagraphic techniques to very interesting effect. While it does not just try to be weird for weirdness's sake, I can only say that I have never seen anything remotely like it.Joaquin Phoenix gives a memorable performance as ""aberrated"" WWII veteran Freddie Quell, a unique if not particularly endearing character. The entire film centers around Quell's codependent relationship with Lancaster Dodd, the founder of the embryonic L. Ron Hubbardish ""Cause."" Although they are two very different people, the way the two men connect in their mutual fantasy is both fascinating and believable.THE MASTER could be interpreted many different ways.

(Is it REALLY just all about getting laid?)This film's detractors frequently accuse it of being an exercise in sophomoric pornography disguised as ""Art.""

1544426,ACW4P33TPKDWW,B008220DGE,Drew from Oregon,"[4, 9]","This review does contain spoilers.I was fortunate enough to receive a copy of this Blu-ray for review.  The Master is a post-WWII drama starring Philip Seymour Hoffman (Lancaster Dodd ""The Master""), Joaquin Phoenix (Freddie Quell), and Amy Adams (Peggy Dodd).  The movie starts where WWII ends basically and shows some war veterans being treated for PTSD as they are talking to doctors and trying to adjust to life after the war.  The movie suggests that life would be hard in the world after witnessing the horrors the war had to offer.Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix) is an alcoholic and likes to mix things together that is readily available to him to make his own alcoholic drinks.  At one point we see him mixing drinks with paint thinner.  Anyway, after the war, Freddie starts out as a photographer in a department store taking pictures of families and individuals.  He eventually gets into a fight with some guy and runs away.  After being a photographer for a while, he ends up in a cabbage field harvesting cabbage.  He gets run off by the people in the cabbage field because they accuse him of poisoning someone with one of his mixed alcoholic drinks.Eventually, Freddie ends up on a ship, although he doesn't really know how he got there, this is where he meets Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman), or ""The Master.""  Lancaster tells Freddie that he stumbled drunk onto the ship and that's why he doesn't really remember how he got there.  He also tells Freddie that he looks familiar or has some sort of familiarity about him.  Lancaster seems to be some sort of hypnotist on the ship as the movie shows him going through a session with a woman.  The woman, under hypnosis, seems to recall details about her past.Freddie and Lancaster sit together to talk a bit, but Lancaster has other plans.  Lancaster starts recording the conversation that he is having with Freddie and he starts to ask him numerous questions, in which we find out a lot about Freddie's background in this part of the film.  Lancaster calls this process of asking questions ""processing"".  During ""processing"", Freddie recalls his 16 year old girlfriend, Doris.  At this time, Freddie seemed to be hypnotized by Lancaster.After a while, the ship arrives in New York.  Lancaster is performing a session in front of a crowd of people where the woman he has hypnotized thinks she is a man for a brief moment.  A skeptic calls Lancaster out on his sessions and we find out a bit more about what is going on.  Lancaster says that people's spirits live on when they die and later they may take on a different form called a ""spirit vessel"".  We find out that Lancaster is performing some sort of past life hypnotization, which he calls it ""dehypnotization"" or an awakening.  The skeptic calls it ""time travel hypnosis,"" which he doesn't believe in.  After arguing a bit, things calm down.  Later that night, Freddie goes to the skeptic and beats him up for questioning ""The Master.""Lancaster has a warrant out for his arrest for operating a medical school without a license.  At this time, Freddie gets arrested as well for interfering with the police officers.  Lancaster gets out of jail before Freddie and this is where we find out about ""The Cause.""  At dinner later that night, Lancaster's family discuss ""The Cause"" and express concerns that Freddie is not totally committed.  Lancaster's son-in-law even goes as far as to say that Freddie is a spy or imposter.  Lancaster thanks them for their honesty and concerns.When Freddie gets out of jail, they all go to Phoenix, Arizona to release ""The Master's"" second book called, ""Split Sabre.""  Freddie talks to Lancaster's publisher about the book and the publisher voices his opinions that the book isn't very good at all.  Freddie takes him outside and attacks him.  While in Arizona, Freddie, Lancaster, Lancaster's daughter, and her husband all go to the desert and play a game.  The game is called, ""Pick a Point,"" where they must pick a point off in the distance of the desert and ride a motorcycle as fast as they can to that point.  Lancaster goes first and returns.  After Lancaster, Freddie goes.  Freddie keeps going and we don't see him coming back.  Some people see this as Freddie wrecking the motorcycle and dying; however, my interpretation of this part is that Freddie has finally escaped his past and has been awakened.  He is finally free of his demons.After the ""Pick a Point"" scene, we see Freddie going to Doris' house to find her.  He finds out that she is married in Alabama with two kids.  This does not seem to bother Freddie too much as he knew she was too young for him anyway.  The movie then shows Freddie asleep in a movie theater.  He receives a phone call from Lancaster telling him that he is in England and that he can help Freddie if he goes there.  After Freddie arrives in England, we find out that Lancaster and Freddie used to work together in a past life releasing messenger balloons.  That's where the familiarity comes into play for Lancaster.  After finding this out, Freddie leaves as Lancaster's wife says that he cannot be helped.  Freddie picks up a woman at a bar and eventually starts to ask her questions in the same way Lancaster asked him when he was ""processing"".  The movie ends with Freddie laying on a beach next to a woman made of sand that looked like the same woman made of sand at the beginning of the movie.Overall, this movie was, in my opinion, a very good movie.  It's really a movie that warrants at least two viewings in order to catch every detail that maybe you didn't catch the first time around.  The Blu-ray/DVD/EC Combo pack is loaded with 102 minutes of special features including: ""Back Beyond"", which are outtakes and additional scenes, teasers/trailers, ""Unguided Message"" an 8 minute behind-the-scenes short, and ""Let There Be Light"" (1946) John Huston's landmark documentary about WWII veterans.The acting in this movie is superb; however, I've always been a fan of Philip Seymour Hoffman and Joaquin Phoenix, so I may be a bit biased.  The story line is great as well; however may be hard to follow for some.  Overall, I give this movie a 5/5 rating.Overall Rating:  5/5",5,"The Master: A ""Must See"" Movie",1361232000,"02 19, 2013",2013,6181,"['review', 'contain', 'spoilers.I', 'was', 'fortunate', 'enough',

After that he really started putting his audiences through the paces and ""The Master"" is no exception.Here's the scoop. Joaquin Phoenix is in the Pacific during WWII. It's not really said if he is a screwed up guy naturally or if the war made him that way, but I suspect it's the former. Now stateside, he gets a job as a department store photographer. He also has a talent for making booze from just about anything at hand. Through a mishap with one of his concoctions he's on the run and ends up on a small ship captained by a New Age-ish guru who is, more than likely scamming his followers. He is taken on by said captain as an acolyte and the adventure begins.This is a character driven movie so the plot line is not laid out in, what one might consider, the normal fashion. I know it would take me at least one more viewing to get a better handle on what this was all about, but it's a fascinating watch nonetheless. Both Phoenix and Hoffman have created memorable characters. Amy Adams is also on hand as Hoffman's wife and a formidable force behind the man. She does a truly stand up job. All the second tier characters are also well drawn. Great attention is paid to period detail. Particularly the costuming. The viewer has no reason to believe he's not looking through a time portal. All the production values, especially the music, are as good as they get. This is a near seamless endeavor.But, getting back to it, this is a character driven film. These people are fascinating. You probably haven't seen the likes of them before, and, even if you don't quite 'get it' right off, it will still nail you to your chair. This is not for the casual movie goer. I heard some people in the theater complaining about the slow pacing but it didn't bother me in the least. I also wondered if it was based on ""The Process Church"" which was a Scientology splinter group in the 60s, but that's another story.

Sure, ""Argo"" proceeds at a break-neck pace and gets everything right, but ""The Master"" is Cinema with a capital C.  Fifty years from now, no one will be watching ""Argo"" or any of the other films coming out, but ""The Master"" feels like it will endure forever.  Speaking of forever:  The Cause at the heart of the film borrows a page from Scientology to posit that our souls were born trillions of years ago, only to be trapped into human bodies by aliens (I think).  ""This is something you're in for a billion years or not at all,"" Amy Adams-- the master's brilliantly humorless consort-- sneers at one point.  The dichotomy between our longing for freedom and our need for love and belonging, between loneliness and tyranny, is at the heart of the film.  ""If you figure a way to live without serving a master, then let the rest of us know... for you'll be the first person in the history of the world,"" L. Ron Hubbard (or Jim Jones-- pick any of your favorite American religious entrepreneurs), played by Philip Seymour Hoffman, tells the protagonist (Joaquin Phoenix).  Joaquin plays a WWII veteran, broken in body and mind; really, the only part of him to have survived intact is his eternal soul.  He is at once intensely human and sympathetic and absolutely terrifying, a loose cannon capable of any madness.The lack of certainty and direction is both this film's great strength and its weakness.

1544441,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B008220DGE,FNDNreview,"[1, 3]","Written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, The Master stars Joaquin Phoenix as Freddie Quell, a World War II vet turned drifter suffering from sex and alcohol addictions - not to mention post-traumatic stress disorder.  Unable to adapt to society after the war, Freddie inadvertently crosses paths with Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman), known as The Master.  Dodd is a founder of a moment, known as &#34;The Cause,&#34; an organization-like cult.  Dodd, the author of his own self-help book, claims he has the ability to cure people by putting in touch with the past via a type of hypnotic time travel - a process that Dodd's son even references as being made up.  Fascinated by the organization, Freddie attempts to adhere to their teachings, but finds himself unable to focus - often reminiscing about his ex-girlfriend, who said she'd wait for him prior to leaving for war.  Amy Adams, Laura Dern, Jesse Plemons and Rami Malek also star in supporting roles.The controversy surrounding The Master has been its comparison to Scientology.  However, writer Paul Thomas Anderson has made no admittance to that allegation, however, the seminaries and dates regarding the history of Scientology seem to match the plot pretty closely &#8211; even making one wonder whether the founder of Scientology is the basis for Philip Seymour Hoffman&#8217;s character.  Regardless, the film&#8217;s story is difficult to describe, often times hard to comprehend &#8211; certainly creating a film that&#8217;s completely different than anything else out there at the moment.  These elements create an engaging idea (plot wise), but once it&#8217;s over &#8211; you&#8217;ll have absolutely no desire to ever watch it again.  It&#8217;s good, but not great.  It&#8217;s horribly boring in spots, yet it&#8217;s hard to stop watching.  Obviously, the most bothersome part for most people will be the film&#8217;s slow-progressing, questionable direction &#8211; which doesn&#8217;t even give clean cut closure to the story.  It&#8217;s an absolutely absurd and perplexing tale, but it will leave you with a feeling of youth and invigoration.  If it sounds mind-blowing, you&#8217;re not wrong.  Themes of fatherhood, leadership, loyalty, and devotion are just a few of the resounding elements that will be left engrained in your mind once the credits role.There&#8217;s little doubt that this storyline provides an interesting take on one man&#8217;s psychological issues after coming back from war.  Joaquin Phoenix brings a sobering demonstration of post-traumatic stress to the screen.  He&#8217;s impeccably precise with his actions and brilliantly moving, often wearing his character&#8217;s emotions on his sleeve.  Pheonix&#8217;s performance was so close to perfection that you&#8217;d think it&#8217;s near impossible to upstage him in this role &#8211; but then there&#8217;s Philip Seymour Hoffman portraying the leader of this cult movement.  He brings a demanding style of leadership and devotion to the cause in this role.  His interactions with Pheonix bring out the best in both of them and it&#8217;s clearly evident that they just feed off one another &#8211; constantly making each other better with every passing scene.  Throw in Academy Award nominee Amy Adams and you&#8217;re filled with constant scenes of sheer enjoyment (to watch).

Couldn't have cared less about any of the characters. Tried to force myself through it just to be objective.Didn't care. Joaquin Phoenix's character is blunt, embarrassing. Looks like he sort of wandered in, doesn't know why he's there in the first place. Drinks anything and everything.Hoffman mumbles like an animated English sheepdog, talks about all sorts of random, different things and feels like a drunk Charlie Chaplin character with a perpetually florid face.The script sounds like it was written by an over-enthusiastic cubicle drone with too much time on his hands and an overinflated sense of Deathless Important Angst-Ridden Pomposity. Everything you see drives home just how hopeless, degenerate, shallow and ridiculous everyone and everything is. The soldiers are promiscuous, sex-starved freaks who in reality would get their @$$es kicked by their COs, department store workers are so flat and dull they're likely to suck the life right out of you - when they're not humping each other and poisoning themselves. For all that the film purports to be focused on redemption, it drives home how worthless and pointless people are.The interview in the first hour between Hoffman's character and a reporter had me somewhat listlessly amused. It sounds like a carefully prepped propaganda argument against religion out of today's news but this time, it doesn't end with the person 'reasonably, rationally, questioning' religion turning beet-red in the face and screaming like a loony. See BBC for appalling reference. The 'Reporter of Sterling Virtue' is calm, suave and erudite, ever-so-reasonable and 'concerned' for the public good. He comes off like a gollygeegosh cardboard cutout from the same era as the movie. One moment of humor in the first hour.Much as I hate to bring the word up again, this movie is pretty hollow propaganda.Will watch this when I feel the need to bore myself to death.

Joaquin Phoenix is an amazing actor who portrays a disturbed sailor, Freddie Quell, who completes his service in the Navy at the end of WWII. We learn that his psychotic mother is institutionalized. Freddie is an alcoholic, delusional drifter who finds himself on a ship with a kindly man, who calls himself ""The Master"" (Philip Seymour Hoffman). Hoffman's character, Dodd, claims to be a doctor, physicist, writer, claims to be able to cure Leukemia, and is another self-delusional individual who has managed to convince his wife, the ever brilliant Amy Adams, and wealthy people that he knows, including a financial underwriter of his exploits magnificently acted by Laura Dern, the secrets of the universe, existence, etc.  He is, in my view, a demonstrable charlatan and snake oil salesman. Dodd's son articulates this view in the film, ""he makes this stuff up as he goes along"".I found it helpful in my attempt to better get a grip on what this story was about to watch the cut scenes on the extra features on this DVD; I think some of the scenes should not have been deleted because they lend more to the story, purportedly having something to do with Scientology. One of the redacted scenes explains that Dodd was injured, underwent surgery during which he had a near-death experience.  I felt that this cut scene helped explain his evident brain damage that inspired his ideology.I have no idea why this film was produced and find it without serious merit. Even the background classical music suddenly intruded into my viewing. The scenes of naked women dancing informed me that insanity loomed and lurked every where in this film.Should you wish to experience living amongst the delusional and insane for two hours, do see the film.

1544454,A328S9RN3U5M68,B008220DGE,Grady Harp,"[3, 6]","Writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson is best known for his works `There Will Be Blood', `Punch-Drunk Love `, `Magnolia' and  `Boogie Nights'. His films often depict the suburban U.S. as a place of alienation, and his characters are often alienated people who must in some way or another learn to assimilate themselves into some kind of family environment. Anderson has certainly proven himself to be a director of formidable skill and power, but has not yet reached a particularly wide audience. THE MASTER has polarized audiences and will probably continue to do so until he manages to produce another mind-bending film the equal of his past successes.The film asks much from the audience: the script is at times confusing and the jumps in time make the film disconnect.  But then that is precisely the kind of world that is being described in this story about a cult leader who has `figured out' how we come to behave and respond the way we do - that it may be traumas or events in our past lives that are finally playing out in order to be purged.Returning from Navy service in World War II, Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix) drifts through a series of PTSD-driven breakdowns, alcoholism, uncontrollable rage, and is totally lacking in the ability to make consistent sense of the world he faces. Finally he stumbles upon a cult that engages in exercises to clear emotions and he becomes deeply involved with them. The Cause is lead by Master Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman) who works with his wife Peggy (Amy Adams) and his children Val (Jesse Plemons) who refuses to participate in his father's exercises because `he's making it up as he goes', Elizabeth (Ambyr Childers) and Elizabeth's new husband Clark (Rami Malek). Freddie first meets this strange group aboard a yacht where, being drunk, he has passed out. Freddie is a bruised soul - not only from his experience in the war, but also because of an abusive childhood (his mother is severely psychiatrically damaged and is hospitalized) and a disrupted ability to form relationships with both women and men. Master takes him in, works with him almost as a laboratory animal, and the Cause hits snags in various locations (in Philadelphia they are hosted by the wealthy Helen Sullivan played by Laura Dern), with moments that border on psychotic taste and credibility. There is no true resolution to the encounters between Freddie and Master except at film's end when the Master tells Freddie, `If you figure a way to live without serving a master, any master, then let the rest of us know, will you? For you'd be the first person in the history of the world.'THE MASTER disturbs but it makes us consider the concept of mind manipulation by cult leaders while at the same time opening the possibility to consider time travel, metaphysics, and spiritualism. The three leads  - Phoenix, Hoffman and Adams  - are exceptionally fine, and the huge supporting cast is ably manipulated by Anderson to achieve the mind-bending effects he desires. The musical score is compelling as assembled by Radiohead member Johnny Greenwood, a highly regarded composer who has collaborated with Polish composer Krzysztof Penderecki in the past, and the very strange cinematography (a characteristic of Anderson's films) is in the hands of Mihai Malaimare Jr.  THE MASTER will not appeal to everyone, but it is an experimental film that takes many risks and succeeds in proving its point of view.

They were upset that they paid good money and sat through more than 2 hours of this clap trap.Hoffman plays the master, the leader of a group of people who follow his teachings, sort of a past life regression to find out why they are so unhappy with their current life (because they realize they are trapped in this movie?) while Hoffman says things such as he is not hypnotizing them, he is waking them up to the past they forgot!Amy Adams plays his current wife and you're not quite sure if she is the loyal follower or the Lady Macbeth behind the movement.And then we have Joaquin Phoenix an aimless drifter, a mean drunk and a general waste of space who becomes the great project of redemption for Hoffman, who wants to prove his ideas can help anyone and not just bored socialites.All this sounds very good, but it's not. The film is aimless leaves many threads unanswered. Not such real mysteries as does Hoffman really believe what he's saying or is it a scam, so much as , ""Where the heck are the living now?"" A long montage of programming, I mean therapy, for Phoenix isn't moving or even creepy. It's just aimless, boring and manages to suck all life out of the film bringing what little plot we have to a screaming halt.Adams is great as the wife who has the glow of the true believer about her, the fanatic convert to her husband's beliefs. Hoffman sparkles. His portrayal is often the only thing that keep the film moving.  He gives a sense that his character have many, many levels to it, and we want to stick around to see them all.The problem is Phoenix. Not aging well he's unpleasant to look at and worse to listen to. He spends the entire film channeling Marlin Brando at his worst and speaking through clenched teeth in what we're supposed to think is a show of cool indifference to the world about him. What results though is a character so one dimensional that a semicolon has more personality. You get the feeling he spent the entire film waiting for someone to ask him ""What are you rebelling against johnny?"" just so he can give the brando answer 'What ah ya got?""A combination of an aimless plot and this horrific characterization in what is very nearly a two person drama, makes it an unwatchable mess.

1544458,A13TO5TU4A68LD,B008220DGE,Gryphonisle,"[1, 3]","Filmed in a size film that was typical to the period of its setting, but no longer used, ""The Master"" feels and looks like a mid-century, big studio film, lush and expensive.  Costumes and mannerisms seem to be point-on.  Just as a film, ""The Master"" is worth watching and easy to look at.  The subject matter is apparently Scientology, but the film is not peddling Scientology, although I understand that the more you know about it, the more you'll take away.  I know little, and don't feel I missed much.  I grew up in California, I live in San Francisco, so when someone comes up and tells me that ""This Rock"" is the new God, I'm neither impressed nor amazed;  I've seen a lot of such rocks.  Still, it is interesting to see a cult in action, from at it's inception...Joachim Phoenix got a lot of press for getting so deep in character and staying there.  The problem is that it seems he started a bit prematurely.  Freddie Quell is a loner, and one of those screwed up war veterans that we take for granted from WWI and Vietnam, but for which the narrative of WWII seems to have had all veterans stepping off the boat and going to school, and moving to a cul de sac.  The problem is, Freddie was messed up IN the Navy, and probably had issues before he was drafted.  So, now the War is over and Freddie can't get it together.  He blows one job as a department store photographer; he blows a job cutting cabbages---although in truth, that wasn't entirely his fault.  Then, walking down one of those docks by the bay, he stumbles upon a yacht party, and wakes up on the yacht, sailing out, beneath the Golden Gate Bridge.  But this isn't just any yacht, it's the yacht of Lancaster Dodd, who may or may not be L. Ron Hubbard.  This could be real scary, but when you're Freddie Quell and your life is a fruit bowl where the apples and oranges are discriminating against the bananas and mangos, as foreigners, Dodd comes across like a pineapple set in the middle of the table, in it's own space, and Freddie enter's his orbit, willingly.  For his part, Dodd (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) sees Freddie both as an oddball like himself;  entertainingly independent from him; and someone to prove his philosophy upon, by curing him.It doesn't quite work out that way, but the getting there is entertaining enough.As it turns out, Dodd is something of the figurehead for a cult of his wife's ideas, as played by Amy Adams.  He's got the bombast and stage presence to take her ideas to the Big People who will listen.  Although as the movie progresses, Freddie's loose-cannon mentality becomes more of an attack dog, acting on the behalf of his Master, but not always with the Master's orders.This is a relationship movie, about people and their relationships;  and how people will surrender themselves to other people, often with the least plausible reasons for doing so;  as a result, there's lots of talking, and very little action.  No special effects.  And, while it's a pretty movie to watch, you don't see a lot.  It takes place in San Francisco, New York, and Philadelphia, but much of it is filmed in Mare Island (navy ship yard) and Vallejo, so in many ways it's a studio backlot film, but with real places as the back lot, but still not an on-location film.  That works, for the most part, in setting the film in its own bubble of a lost reality, from another era;  you're never really where you are supposed to be, but then again, so are most of the characters in this film.If you can sit still for an action-free movie, and don't get all riled everytime someone talks about their religious ideas, this may well prove to be a quietly entertaining film for you.",3,"Elegant, Often Beautiful Period Film;  Convincing Story;  Cult Oriented Plot Line Will Discourage Some.",1362614400,"03 7, 2013",2013,3662,"['Filmed', 'size', 'film', 'was', 'typical', 'period', 'setting', 'no', 'longer', 'used', 'Master', 'feels', 'mid-century', 'big', 'studio', 'film', 'lush', 'expensive', 'Costumes', 'mannerisms', 'seem', 'be', 'point-on', 'Just', 'film', 'Master', 'worth', 'watching', 'easy', 'look', 'subject', 'matter', 'apparently', 'Scientology', 'film', 'not', 'peddling', 'Scientology', 'understand', 'more', 'know', 'more', ""'ll"", 'take', 'away', 'know', 'little', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'missed', 'much', 'grew', 'up', 'California', 'live', 'San', 'Francisco', 'so', 'when', 'someone', 'up', 'tells', 'Rock', 'new', 'God', ""'m"", 'impressed', 'amazed', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'such', 'rocks', 'Still', 'interesting', 'see', 'cult', 'action', 'inception', 'Joachim', 'Phoenix', 'got', 'lot', 'press', 'getting', 'so', 'deep', 'character', 'staying', 'there', 'problem', 'started', 'bit', 'prematurely', 'Freddie', 'Quell', 'loner', 'one', 'screwed', 'up', 'war', 'veterans', 'take', 'granted', 'WWI', 'Vietnam', 'narrative', 'WWII', 'have', 'had', 'veterans', 'stepping', 'off', 'boat', 'going', 'school', 'moving', 'cul', 'sac', 'problem', 'Freddie', 'was', 'messed', 'up', 'IN', 'Navy', 'probably', 'had', 'issues', 'was', 'drafted', 'So', 'now', 'War', 'Freddie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'together', 'one', 'job', 'department', 'store', 'photographer', 'job', 'cutting', 'cabbages', 'truth', 'was', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'fault', 'Then', 'walking', 'down', 'one', 'docks', 'bay', 'yacht', 'party', 'up', 'yacht', 'sailing', 'out', 'Golden', 'Gate', 'Bridge', ""n't"", 'just', 'yacht', 'yacht', 'Lancaster', 'Dodd', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'L.', 'Ron', 'Hubbard', 'could', 'be', 'real', 'scary', 'when', ""'re"", 'Freddie', 'Quell', 'life', 'fruit', 'bowl', 'where', 'apples', 'oranges', 'are', 'discriminating', 'bananas', 'mangos', 'foreigners', 'Dodd', 'pineapple', 'set', 'middle', 'table', 'own', 'space', 'Freddie', 'enter', 'orbit', 'willingly', 'part', 'Dodd', 'Phillip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'Freddie', 'oddball', 'entertainingly', 'independent', 'someone', 'prove', 'philosophy', 'curing', 'him.It', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', 'out', 'way', 'getting', 'entertaining', 'enough.As', 'out', 'Dodd', 'something', 'figurehead', 'cult', 'wife', 'ideas', 'played', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'got', 'bombast', 'stage', 'presence', 'take', 'ideas', 'Big', 'People', 'who', 'will', 'listen', 'movie', 'Freddie', 'loose-cannon', 'mentality', 'more', 'attack', 'dog', 'acting', 'behalf', 'Master', 'not', 'always', 'Master', 'orders.This', 'relationship', 'movie', 'people', 'relationships', 'how', 'people', 'will', 'surrender', 'other', 'people', 'often', 'least', 'plausible', 'reasons', 'doing', 'so', 'result', 'lots', 'talking', 'very', 'little', 'action', 'special', 'effects', 'pretty', 'movie', 'watch', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'lot', 'place', 'San', 'Francisco', 'New', 'York', 'Philadelphia', 'much', 'filmed', 'Mare', 'Island', 'navy', 'ship', 'yard', 'Vallejo', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'studio', 'backlot', 'film', 'real', 'places', 'back', 'lot', 'still', 'not', 'on-location', 'film', 'most', 'part', 'setting', 'film', 'own', 'bubble', 'lost', 'reality', 'era', ""'re"", 'never', 'really', 'where', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'then', 'again', 'so', 'are', 'most', 'characters', 'film.If', 'can', 'sit', 'still', 'action-free', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'riled', 'everytime', 'someone', 'talks', 'religious', 'ideas', 'may', 'well', 'prove', 'be', 'quietly', 'entertaining', 'film']",N/A

I saw it yesterday and I cannot help but be at the crossroads with this film. An actor is often born to do a role and PTA has a quality I most like in him to give feature, character and a hopelaiden finish to his characters.Be it Daniel Day Lewis, Mark Wahlberg, Paul Dano, Tom Cruise, Adam Sandler or even John Reily, PTA constructed them into characters and armed them and positioned them most well in his films. Their confidence, their overwhelming character portrayal, their dialogues, the derivation all was very well done.Now here's where I am at a sort of crossroad about THE MASTER, you see Hoffman not since Savages has played a role so well, so meant for him and Joaquin Phoenix has never played a more poignant unforgettable character than he does in here. BUT, and here's a huge but, the film left me with no answers.It isn't based on capitalism, it isn't based on the dogma of war, isn't necessarily based on anything but understanding psychology and character of the two center characters. You're often looking for clues to understand what to believe in, it's a tedious watch but after all those films, I'm left wondering if I should actually watch The Master again, did I miss something?I don't understand why people are praising Amy Adams, all she does is sit on a chair the whole film and express concern and worry. Maybe she was the only character who was easy to understand? I don't know. She was like furniture.Hoffman and Phoenix both act in some of their best roles in their lives. I don't think Phoenix could have been cast better. I did observe however that the latter half of the film doesn't offer many beautiful sets to look at like the first fifteen minutes of the film.There is an overwhelming sense of Americana in the film and I liked that about all PTA films. But the film while it contained a generous amount of drama, ends up being a bit too cynically clout in it's own delirium I hate to admit. Obviously PTA sees something here that I dont and never will. I was a bit exasperated after the film ended not knowing what to believe. I noticed the theme of changing partners present in the score the whole film and it finally played in the end.So to all viewers - I'd say ""take it easy"" , this is not at opinionated as any of his films. It's like that one book in the library that is falling into tatters...you go you pick it up and start reading very confused at first, you read ten chapters of what you understand...and then you wonder if you should go on or give up.",3,The Master.,1359849600,"02 3, 2013",2013,2607,"['waited', 'Master', 'longest', 'was', 'easily', 'most', 'anticipated', 'film', '2012', 'saw', 'yesterday', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'be', 'crossroads', 'film', 'actor', 'often', 'born', 'do', 'role', 'PTA', 'quality', 'most', 'give', 'feature', 'character', 'hopelaiden', 'finish', 'characters.Be', 'Daniel', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'even', 'John', 'Reily', 'PTA', 'constructed', 'characters', 'armed', 'positioned', 'most', 'well', 'films', 'confidence', 'overwhelming', 'character', 'portrayal', 'dialogues', 'derivation', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done.Now', 'here', 'where', 'am', 'sort', 'crossroad', 'THE', 'MASTER', 'see', 'Hoffman', 'not', 'Savages', 'played', 'role', 'so', 'well', 'so', 'meant', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'never', 'played', 'more', 'poignant', 'unforgettable', 'character', 'here', 'BUT', 'here', 'huge', 'film', 'left', 'answers.It', ""n't"", 'based', 'capitalism', ""n't"", 'based', 'dogma', 'war', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'based', 'anything', 'understanding', 'psychology', 'character', 'two', 'center', 'characters', ""'re"", 'often', 'looking', 'clues', 'understand', 'what', 'believe', 'tedious', 'watch', 'films', ""'m"", 'left', 'wondering', 'should', 'actually', 'watch', 'Master', 'again', 'did', 'miss', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'people', 'are', 'praising', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'sit', 'chair', 'whole', 'film', 'express', 'concern', 'worry', 'Maybe', 'was', 'only', 'character', 'who', 'was', 'easy', 'understand', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'like', 'furniture.Hoffman', 'Phoenix', 'act', 'best', 'roles', 'lives', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Phoenix', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cast', 'better', 'did', 'observe', 'however', 'latter', 'half', 'film', ""n't"", 'offer', 'many', 'beautiful', 'sets', 'look', 'first', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'film.There', 'overwhelming', 'sense', 'Americana', 'film', 'liked', 'PTA', 'films', 'film', 'contained', 'generous', 'amount', 'drama', 'up', 'being', 'bit', 'too', 'cynically', 'clout', 'own', 'delirium', 'hate', 'admit', 'Obviously', 'PTA', 'something', 'here', 'dont', 'never', 'will', 'was', 'bit', 'exasperated', 'film', 'ended', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'believe', 'noticed', 'theme', 'changing', 'partners', 'present', 'score', 'whole', 'film', 'finally', 'played', 'end.So', 'viewers', ""'d"", 'say', 'take', 'easy', 'not', 'opinionated', 'films', 'one', 'book', 'library', 'falling', 'tatters', 'go', 'pick', 'up', 'start', 'reading', 'very', 'confused', 'first', 'read', 'ten', 'chapters', 'what', 'understand', 'then', 'wonder', 'should', 'go', 'give', 'up']",N/A

Alcoholism is a symptom. Lack of normal human relationships another. Some, like Freddie Quell (2013 Oscar lead actor nomination for Joaquin Phoenix) look for a route to improvement--even a cult group like ""The Cause."" The sect's leader, Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman gets a 2013 supporting role Oscar nomination) called by the members ""The Master,"" leaches upon the weak and infirm.Even though memories are not invited-- they are never far behind.This film attempts-- to some degree succeeds-- to place the viewer into the emotional state of the troubled protagonist. There is no right or wrong answer as there is no logical path to a non-conclusive end of the torment. Flashbacks & memories comprise some of the footage that tells of one man's experiences rather than a story with a plot. A quite disturbing image of the inside psychological dimensions of a cult. The Master's' wife, Peggy (Amy Adams- `Julie & Julia') assists in the reprogramming of victims. Star Adams also received a nomination nod for 2013 Oscar supporting actress. The 3 primary roles were acted well, leaving viewers distressed to know the character.This is a 1950 period film, well done in the historical sense through sets, costumes, and props.

1544467,A1Y0HX12MCT6OR,B008220DGE,I'm Right,"[0, 0]","The Master is an amazing film in many different ways. Technically it's perfect, the setting, the music, the acting, the scenery is all lush and realistic. The acting is also phenomenal, particularly Phoenix. The story is what trips a lot of people up, hell the first time I saw this in theaters my mind felt scattered for the next couple of days trying to piece everything together to little avail. Finally got around to watching it again and it's still really damn complex all around.Freddy is a world war 2 veteran who aimlessly wanders into random jobs until he wakes up on a boat run by 'Master' Dodd, and Dodd senses an unspoken comradery between him and Freddy. Throughout the film Freddy is encourage by Dodd to adapt to their cult and drop his impulsive habits. Their relationship isn't mutual though, Dodd regards Freddy more as a dog or a son then a friend. Possibly due to his usual nature of being around yes-men and passively ordering people around. Near the end as Freddy makes the most progress to being a reformed member of the cult he finds that he simply can't do it and resumes being his usual self. Dodd, while acting passively condescending to Freddy, also admires his free spirited nature towards everything.Another relationship that isn't shown as in depth is Dodd and his wife Peggy. While Dodd is the leader and showman of the cult, Peggy is the one who's really running the show behind closed doors.She is the first one to basically ask Dodd ""what the hell is he doing here"" regarding Freddy, since everyone else never questions or doubts their master. So in regards to power and control: Peggy>Dodd>Freddy. However Freddy isn't interested in playing ball, despite his best efforts he eventually realizes that the cult isn't for him and drops out, much to Dodd's dismay. What's ironic is how in the beginning Dodd and Peggy regard all naysayers to their cause as ""scared"", yet Dodd is clearly intimidated by Freddy's apathy during the end and threatens that if he leaves again they'll be mortal enemies.God damn this movie, I could go on and on, so I will. Similar to Paul Thomas Anderson's prior movie There Will Be Blood, there are many themes in play throughout the movie. Unlike There Will Be Blood, The Master's are much more subtle and the movie is like a giant onion where you keep peeling layer after layer off the movie. But the main thing I saw in The Master is multiple contradicting dualities in human nature. Most notably Freddy's impulsive nature vs Dodd's intellectual nature, and various layers of the relationship. I noticed some people criticized this movie for not having a 'likable' character, which wasn't the point of this movie. Instead it shows all of these dualities and contradictions between many different people trying to work together. Instead of taking sides, Paul Thomas Anderson shows them all on a level playing field, and letting the audience decide for themselves regarding the character's motivations and such.This movie is mind wracking, and is perfect for watching and discussing afterwards at a coffeehouse or something. You can tell Paul Thomas Anderson purposely made the film this puzzling and complex without a very satisfying climax to the Master. Unfortunately therein lies the problem with the Master, it's not so much a film as it is a two hour rorschach test like the cover hints at. I've been on the fence regarding the Master for almost a year now, and I still don't really have a clear decision whether I liked it or not. What's certain is that it's definitely something to watch if you're a voracious movie goer and want something to chew on for days, weeks, or months afterward.",4,The Master of Layers,1371600000,"06 19, 2013",2013,3658,"['Master', 'amazing', 'film', 'many', 'different', 'ways', 'Technically', 'perfect', 'setting', 'music', 'acting', 'scenery', 'lush', 'realistic', 'acting', 'also', 'phenomenal', 'particularly', 'Phoenix', 'story', 'what', 'lot', 'people', 'up', 'hell', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'theaters', 'mind', 'felt', 'scattered', 'next', 'couple', 'days', 'trying', 'piece', 'everything', 'together', 'little', 'avail', 'Finally', 'got', 'watching', 'again', 'still', 'really', 'damn', 'complex', 'around.Freddy', 'world', 'war', '2', 'veteran', 'who', 'aimlessly', 'random', 'jobs', 'up', 'boat', 'run', ""'Master"", 'Dodd', 'Dodd', 'unspoken', 'comradery', 'Freddy', 'film', 'Freddy', 'encourage', 'Dodd', 'adapt', 'cult', 'drop', 'impulsive', 'habits', 'relationship', ""n't"", 'mutual', 'Dodd', 'Freddy', 'more', 'dog', 'son', 'then', 'friend', 'Possibly', 'due', 'usual', 'nature', 'being', 'yes-men', 'passively', 'ordering', 'people', 'end', 'Freddy', 'most', 'progress', 'being', 'reformed', 'member', 'cult', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'being', 'usual', 'self', 'Dodd', 'acting', 'passively', 'condescending', 'Freddy', 'also', 'free', 'spirited', 'nature', 'everything.Another', 'relationship', ""n't"", 'shown', 'depth', 'Dodd', 'wife', 'Peggy', 'Dodd', 'leader', 'showman', 'cult', 'Peggy', 'one', 'who', 'really', 'running', 'show', 'closed', 'doors.She', 'first', 'one', 'basically', 'ask', 'Dodd', 'what', 'hell', 'doing', 'here', 'regarding', 'Freddy', 'everyone', 'else', 'never', 'questions', 'doubts', 'master', 'So', 'regards', 'power', 'control', 'Peggy', '>', 'Dodd', '>', 'Freddy', 'However', 'Freddy', ""n't"", 'interested', 'playing', 'ball', 'best', 'efforts', 'eventually', 'cult', ""n't"", 'out', 'much', 'Dodd', 'dismay', 'What', 'ironic', 'how', 'beginning', 'Dodd', 'Peggy', 'regard', 'naysayers', 'cause', 'scared', 'yet', 'Dodd', 'clearly', 'intimidated', 'Freddy', 'apathy', 'end', 'again', ""'ll"", 'be', 'mortal', 'enemies.God', 'damn', 'movie', 'could', 'go', 'will', 'Similar', 'Paul', 'Thomas', 'Anderson', 'prior', 'movie', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'are', 'many', 'themes', 'play', 'movie', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'Master', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'subtle', 'movie', 'giant', 'onion', 'where', 'keep', 'peeling', 'layer', 'layer', 'movie', 'main', 'thing', 'saw', 'Master', 'multiple', 'contradicting', 'dualities', 'human', 'nature', 'Most', 'notably', 'Freddy', 'impulsive', 'nature', 'vs', 'Dodd', 'intellectual', 'nature', 'various', 'layers', 'relationship', 'noticed', 'people', 'criticized', 'movie', 'not', 'having', ""'likable"", 'character', 'was', ""n't"", 'point', 'movie', 'Instead', 'dualities', 'contradictions', 'many', 'different', 'people', 'trying', 'work', 'together', 'Instead', 'taking', 'sides', 'Paul', 'Thomas', 'Anderson', 'level', 'playing', 'field', 'letting', 'audience', 'decide', 'regarding', 'character', 'motivations', 'such.This', 'movie', 'mind', 'wracking', 'perfect', 'watching', 'discussing', 'afterwards', 'coffeehouse', 'something', 'can', 'tell', 'Paul', 'Thomas', 'Anderson', 'purposely', 'made', 'film', 'puzzling', 'complex', 'very', 'satisfying', 'climax', 'Master', 'Unfortunately', 'therein', 'problem', 'Master', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'film', 'two', 'hour', 'rorschach', 'test', 'cover', 'hints', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fence', 'regarding', 'Master', 'almost', 'year', 'now', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'clear', 'decision', 'liked', 'not', 'What', 'certain', 'definitely', 'something', 'watch', ""'re"", 'voracious', 'movie', 'goer', 'want', 'something', 'chew', 'days', 'weeks', 'months', 'afterward']",N/A

1544470,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B008220DGE,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[1, 1]","Paul Thomas Anderson is a filmmaker with one of the strangest resumes in film; he made a decent splash with his quiet modern noir HARD EIGHT, then made arguably his biggest splash with the Scorsese-flavored and ingenious BOOGIE NIGHTS and soon people were expecting greater and greater things. Then came MAGNOLIA, which was another ensemble film, but with sequences just too bizarre for most audiences to connect with, but with the people it did connect with, they found a ""cult"" filmmaker who was ready to get major Hollywood stars on board with a film with decidedly independent sensibilities. After that came the impossibly charming and heartfelt PUNCH-DRUNK LOVE, featuring Adam Sandler in what is a revelatory performance that should have been more career-defining than it turned out to be. It was another film that divided audiences because it showed Sandler as less of a clown and more of a deeply pained individual. After that was the critically-adored yet incredibly dark THERE WILL BE BLOOD, with another powerhouse performance by Daniel Day-Lewis. Now, Anderson has created another film that will be his most divisive yet; a film that seems to be about the birth of Scientology, simply called THE MASTER.It's hard to rehash some of the things in this film, because, while there is something of a Point-A-to-Point-B narrative structure, it seems as fractured and fragile as this film's main character, Freddie (Joaquin Phoenix), the shell-shocked drunkard WWII veteran who finds some semblance of family in the presence of the astute and magnetic writer-academic Lancaster Dodd aka ""The Master"" (Anderson regular Philip Seymour Hoffman), and his demure yet powerful wife Peggy (Amy Adams). The Master's psuedo-science/psuedo-religious/psuedo-psychological group The Cause is small, but incredibly devoted, with Freddie at the center of what could be considered its triumpths on one day and its failures on another. Dodd sees science and elements of science fiction in all life, and appears one day to be a powerful voice in a new era of reason and then the next, a charlatan who is simply leeching off the rich and powerful. No matter what, though, Peggy remains firmly at his side, content to be almost Shakespearean in her duties to her husband.One of the things so polarizing about this film is that the ""events"" in the film are almost incidental when it comes to the performances and the dialogue. The film itself first and foremost serves as the return of Joaquin Phoenix, rising from the ashes of his bizarre self-parody, to his almost Brando-esque magnetism we had seen on display from many of his previous films like the severly underrated WE OWN THE NIGHT, RESERVATION ROAD and QUILLS. His performance is so raw and so incredibly impassioned that we feel that this is no longer a performance we're watching, but almost the subject of a documentary. Say what you will about Day-Lewis as Lincoln or any of the other nominees for Best Actor, but this may very well be the performance of the year. Hoffman is a wonderful blend of antiseptic intellectual and fiercely passionate in his performance, and again, totally magnetic. It's hard to feel who's a more mesmerizing on-screen presence when the two of them share the screen. While Adams is indelible and excellent as Peggy, she sadly doesn't get to give much of an impression since her screentime is relegated to almost a background player against the titans of character that Freddie and The Master are.Visually, the film, shot in 70mm, is incredibly beautiful to look at. Cinematographer Mihai Malaimare Jr. (whose previous credits include the two most recent Francis Ford Coppola films TETRO and YOUTH WITHOUT YOUTH) gives the film such texture that you can see every line on the actors' faces and every grain of sand on a beach. Anderson has created a visually stunning film, if nothing else.And therein lies some of the problem. The film doesn't seem to have much of a narrative, which works both to its benefit and to its liabilities. It never makes a statement that this cult-like gathering of The Cause is either evil or good and leaves that to the audience to decide upon, which is a great benefit. But at the same time, there is no clear protagonist and no clear antagonist, unless you look at the film from a more philosophical point of view. That's all well and good, but anyone would have to admit that for a 2-plus hour film, it doesn't hurt to have a little bit of conflict. But again, the film's narrative can be viewed from a strictly philosophical and sociological point of view, and that is very much in the wheelhouse of the people who love this film.Think what you will about the film, but you can't really deny the raw power of the performances of Phoenix and Hoffman in THE MASTER, and based on the merits of that alone, this is a film worth seeing.",4,"Divisive, but

1544475,AI8X8Y6KU7XXK,B008220DGE,Jason Horsley,"[6, 10]","After watching The Master, I came away with the clear sense that Anderson was less interested in exploring the inner workings of Scientology, or of cult mentality in general, than he was in shaping a profound and personal character study with mythic dimensions (as he attempted with Blood). But as with Blood, though not to the same degree, he failed to develop his characters enough to fill out and drive the story, or to carry the deeper abstract meanings which he wanted to communicate, his ""mythic narrative."" The result, like Blood (though again not so critically), is that the film's storyline and its characters don't quite seem to meet. The film lacks the symbiotic flow of all good narratives, in which characters direct story and story shapes and brings out characters. As a result the movie, despite some brilliant scenes, never quite finds its momentum.Anderson's mythic narrative has to be guessed at, but it seems to have something to do with the sand mermaid at the film's start and with the opening two images of the ocean (femininity) and of Freddy's (Joaquin's Phoenix) helmet poking up over a sandbag, which is probably meant as a phallic symbol. In a subsequent scene, Freddy is given a Rorschach test and answers each time either by citing ""pussy"" or ""cock."" His sexually obsessive nature has already been spelled out in the first couple of scenes, when he mounts the sand mermaid and then masturbates into the ocean. The masturbatory scene is echoed later when Dobbs (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is masturbated by his wife, as a grisly kind of psychological conditioning, ostensibly to get him to quit alcohol. The film implies throughout that Dobbs is dominated and controlled by his wife, and that she is the real force behind ""The Cause."" In one scene, she is even seen dictating to him while he writes, material that presumably goes into one of his early books. Anderson has these Freudian and Jungian themes and images running through his movie, but they aren't especially well-shaped or brought sufficiently to the surface to deepen the dramatic tension between characters. It's not so much that they seem like an afterthought as the reverse: it's as though he is more interested in abstract themes, and considers story and character to be subservient to them. This is only a guess however, since these themes are never allowed to show themselves fully.Freddy's sexual addiction goes hand in hand with his alcoholism, a weakness shared by Dobbs and which bonds them together at the start of their relationship (when Dobbs has Freddy make hooch for him). Scientology partially established its reputation by claiming to cure alcoholism, so this may be intended as an ironic commentary. All substance addictions (if we include sex, which produces hormones that can be addictive) have to do with a desire to lose oneself, to immerse oneself in blissful, oceanic otherness, whether the otherness of a lover or a drug. The original blissful immersion is with the mother and the all-nurturing, all-comforting womb. Perhaps this is implied by the way Dobbs, for all his apparent mastery, is actually mastered by his wife, i.e., is still in thrall to (immersed in) his mother's psyche. These are all compelling readings of the film (for me at least), but since they only occurred to me while writing this piece, they perhaps shouldn't be seen as intrinsic to the film's meaning, especially since they aren't ever fully developed.The main problem with The Master is that it lacks a third act. The reason it lacks a third act I think has to do with the fact that the relationship between Freddy and Dobbs, the film's main element, is insufficiently developed. I presume that what Anderson is shooting for is a father-son story. If we allow this to be the overriding theme of the movie, that naturally incorporates all the other ones too. The major tension between a father and son is competition for the mother-wife's attention, and Dobb's wife is shown to be the hidden ""master"" of the film's title. But Anderson seems to have deliberately undermined his theme by casting Phoenix in the son role. Freddy has been written as a much younger man; he is shown as being in love with a sixteen year-old before going off to the Navy, seven years earlier. So by this logic, Freddy must be in his mid-twenties, where Dobbs is probably in his fifties. Joaquin Phoenix is just shy of forty and looks older.[1] Because of this, the two men are more like unequal brothers than a father and son; more critically still, they don't ever seem to be rivals, for Dobbs wife or anything else. We are never shown what draws the two men together, or what creates such an intense and passionate bond between them. (Or even exactly what Dobbs sees in Freddy that no one else does.) The core of the movie, where all the psychological tension, conflict, passion, and meaning should be found, is mysteriously empty.There are three levels (at least) to a great movie (and probably to any work of art): there's the story, the underlying mythic narrative, and then, sandwiched between text and subtext, making the whole thing cohere and giving it flavor, there's the psychology of the characters. Movies like Taxi Driver, The Godfather, Blue Velvet, or The Wild Bunch possess supreme coherence. There's no sense of the three layers existing separate from each other: it's a sandwich and you don't pick it apart to see what's in it, you just eat it (and let it consume you). The Master is not only missing a third act, it's missing that central cohesive material that fills out the sandwich. It's two-thirds of a great movie, which makes it less satisfying than even a really good movie. (For example, Killing Them Softly is a much less ambitious work than The Master, but it's all the more satisfying because of it.)Based on his last two films, I suspect Paul Thomas Anderson is falling prey to the Kubrick Syndrome. The Kubrick Syndrome is an often fatal disorder which happens when directors become consumed by their own desire for greatness and start to lose sight of the ordinary, everyday details--the nuance--that enrich a story and make it compelling, not only at a mythic level but at a more intimate, mundane one too. The Master lacks nuance and intimacy and as a result feels claustrophobic, stuffy, impersonal. It's missing a narrative arc or a satisfying climax because Anderson hasn't brought his characters sufficiently to life for them to tell him how the story should end (or, put differently: so he can tell his own story through them). Maybe it has to do with Anderson's own relationship with his father. Perhaps he felt drawn to explore the subject but, when it was time to go all the way in there, he shied away? We can only speculate. But considering the courage and audacity which Anderson must have summoned to tackle his subject at all, the movie feels timid. It shows us the torrid surfaces of the ocean, but it never drags us into the depths.For the last chunk of the film, Freddy wanders aimlessly about until Dobbs lures him back for a final showdown, only to tell him that he's not welcome there anyway. Did Dobbs feel rejected by Freddy and bring him back  to reject him, to ease his own sense of impotence? Was it Dobbs' way of regaining a feeling of dominance, of reassuring himself that he was still Freddy's ""master""? That would be in keeping with the father-son theme, and it's implied, even stated outright, by the final dialogue between the two men. Dobbs challenges Freddy to exist without a master, saying he will be the first person who ever lived to do so. He tells Freddy (rather petulantly) that, if they do meet in another life, he, Dobbs, will be Freddy's sworn enemy. This is father and son stuff, but since that Oedipal tension hasn't been properly developed between the two men, it never comes to an emotional climax, only an intellectual one. The final showdown seems flat,  shapeless, and inert.Anderson had a compelling enough story, and a plenty ambitious enough undertaking, to keep him busy without straining after subtext. If he had simply stuck to exploring the makings of a world-wide cult, and if he'd trusted his subject matter instead of trying to deepen it and mythologize it, the psychology and narrative drive would have naturally grown out of it. Like Kubrick, Anderson may not be satisfied to be a ""mere"" storyteller. He seems to be after bigger fish, even if they are the fishes of his own mind.This one got away.",3,Two Thirds of a Great Movie,1360540800,"02 11, 2013",2013,8463,"['watching', 'Master', 'came',

To show the weak directing and editing: In one scene something exciting is happening, and just when it starts to get really interesting, just when you start to think it may be related to a recent event, they cut away from it, and never mention it again! You will never know if the two events are connected, or what happened!!  Uh!  What a horrible movie!I see why critics and The Academy loved THE MASTER.  It's an edgy, uncomfortable, strangely directed expos&eacute; on the founder of one of the biggest cults in the world.  But in THE MASTER they show you the beginnings of one man's experiments on clearing emotional struggles by using time travel of the soul instead of hypnotherapy, which sounds like a great idea, but he talks about going back Billions of years.  Plus he makes irrational changes to the process early on.  And in this expos&eacute;, they don't show you much about the organization or really ""expose"" anything important or interesting.  We've all probably heard about the little bit they do show at some point in our lives, so not only is it not an enjoyable movie, it's a complete waste of time.While in CLOUD ATLAS we are shown - in a very enlightening, most fascinating, and brutally honest way - the consequences of the actions of human beings through the centuries, and what happens to people in future lives, when they had been kind to people, and when they had been cruel.So which is better?  I say the one that was more enjoyable, and vastly more important, CLOUD ATLAS.Which movie was nominated for an Oscar? THE MASTER received three Acting Nominations, while CLOUD ATLAS was not nominated for any Oscars at all.  That's typical.  But if you would like to see two great movies about re-incarnation in the next few months... I'd say buy or rent: ON A CLEAR DAY YOU CAN SEE FOREVER and then CLOUD ATLAS.And if you are in the mood for a strange little, dull story about the beginnings of a bizarre cult that's not even a good expos&eacute;, then see THE MASTER, by all means.

Joaquin Phoenix is simply brilliant and mesmerizing to watch as a mentally deranged drunk named Freddy who falls into the thrall of a cult leader named Lancaster Dodd:  Phoenix's expressions are captured like a Van Gogh self-portrait on film.  The cinematography is simple but supple, a visual feast of colors and contrasts that belie the complex psychology of the individuals.  Amy Adams is terrific as the loyal and domineering wife of Lancaster Dodd who single-handedly wills her husband to success.  And then there's the dark volatile chemistry between Freddy and Lancaster Dodd.Dodd anoints Freddy his guinea pig and his protege, and most of the movie is devoted to the eery tactics that Dodd employs to ""make better"" Freddy, mainly teaching him how to distort reality and how to disassociate with it, so that Freddy's anger and insanity become trapped inside with the intensity of a star that is about to go supernova.  What's intriguing about the relationship is how Freddy is merely an emaciated and erratic doppelganger of Dodd.  Both are insane and aggressive megalomaniacs in their own right -- it's just that Lancaster Dodd is more adept with words, spinning an illusion to snare those looking to be snared.But while there were many intriguing possibilities in the movie, it eventually spun out of control into incoherence.

1544482,AL9WKVMRI6GFB,B008220DGE,JMM,"[1, 2]","Paul Thomas Anderson's directorial efforts have always been somewhat slight.  He presents you with a world (supported by stunning cinematography and production design) and then leaves you to watch his characters interact.  Anderson's previous film, There Will Be Blood, was the same way - its more of a character piece than a plot-driven work.  Given that he writes his own material, you can tell that his films are perfectly-calibrated and well though out... but they often lack a driving narrative force.  This is not a criticism, but merely a unique difference between Anderson's films and most other movies.With The Master, I feel there is no inherent meaning in the film - I take away an increased awareness of the dangers of religions, cults, and the like.  But someone else could take away an entirely different message.  Anderson always has a lot to say in his films, but what we the audience wish to make of it is entirely up to us.The main reason I recommend this film is for the performances (three of which were Oscar nominated).  Joaquin Phoenix and Philip Seymour Hoffman in particular have great roles and make a big impression.  Hoffman's character, the one they call ""Master"", is the leader of an organization called The Cause.  But does he really believe what he says, or is he really making it up as he goes along?

They may also be missing something special. In addition to being glowing symbols more than they are conventional characters, neither Freddie Quell (Jochain Phoenix) or Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffmann) is especially likable.But the performances suggest emotional and historical truth in ways that are often moving, without pretension or sentimentality. Freddie Quell is a figure of the American male id, post World War II: violent, sensuous, insatiable. He's driven to drink drafts of American industry to quench his burning: the fuel of torpedoes, the fluids of photography, institutional cleaners, all mixed with the fruits of the earth. Dodd, ""The Master,"" is a new-model super ego who might tame and direct Quell. Dodd is smug as a baronial magnate, as full of literary pretensions as Tom Sawyer; his resolve is borrowed from his steely wife (Amy Adams).Hoffman's Dodd, contrary to rumors about the film, is not a charismatic, psychological autocrat, but is wounded, defensive, and dreamy. He lives out a fantasy of priestly insight and command, but few people really believe him; he gets the benefit of many doubts. As Quell is drawn to Dodd's fantasies of mind over history, Dodd is drawn to Quell's energy and chemical inventiveness. Together they suggest different means of achieving atomic-age versions of the old American goal of obliterating the past and standing alone in a new present. They also suggest the polar tensions of raw animal desire and magisterial fantasies of triumph present in many American men. Quell's desire to consume, dominate and love the earth (Quell is obsessed with a woman sculpted in sand) meets a rhetoric of platonic self-mastery in Dodd.The preposterous incongruity of the men and their desires does not result in a drama of control and exploitation, which audiences may expect, but in inchoate attempts at mutual understanding in several scenes that, if not more humanly intimate, are yet more dramatically resonant than most sexual episodes in movies. The 70mm ""real film"" photography in this movie is amazing; many of the film's strongest moments, including those with people, are wordless. An irony of the film is that lush and magnificent nature (the Pacific ocean, the Arizona desert, the San Francisco Bay) is often overlooked by Quell and Dodd in their self involutions. Nature in American writing often becomes a symbol of self; the oceanic and desert shots sometimes suggest the roiling interior energies and ideal spaces of these two men, but they barely acknowledge these colossal, external realities. But lived, human nature may have the last word, in an ending that is unexpectedly funny and tender.

The Master is a dense, brooding, immaculately produced (shot on jaw-dropping 70mm film--they do make it like they used to, only better!) and exquisitely acted pscyho-sexual drama/period piece that is 100% not for everyone. If you like literary works by people like Faulkner, Camus, or have a dirty penchant for Freud but don't know exactly where to aim it, this is your film. PTA doesn't spell things out, nor should he. The kind of movie goer who would find this movie endearing (and I use the word lightly, or at least in a way one wouldn't apply it to say, The Avengers), aren't the kind of folks who crave easy answers. Thankfully, the narrative structure is linear enough that you aren't going to be infuriated, only curious, when the credits roll. I have heard comparisons to Sofia Coppola which are facile and pretty much just plain wrong. Maybe her early work. But Somewhere, this ain't. The plot, as other reviewers have doubtlessly endumbaerated, is a pretty straightforward sex-obsessessed PTSD-stricken WWII soldier is absorbed into a Scientology-esque cult after running amok through post-war America kind of thing. Once in the cult, said soldier begins to become 'processed', ie brought into the fold in a dark and gradually psychologically unraveling sort of way that is supposed to break him down, condition him, pick him apart, but really, well...you'll see. All that you need to know is that the true crux symbolically lies between he who deems himself master over beast or boy and what that means for both parties. Hoffman is reliable as always, and Adams is, as usual, underused but stunning as the cruel but calculating wife waiting in the wings and perhaps pulling the strings for the big guy. It is Phoenix's show however, and God does he own every single scene as deplorable paint-thinner slurping, sand castle defiling Freddie Quell. That shambling simian walk and arms akimbo pose of reflection ought to have garnered him at least an oscar nod. For shame.

1544505,AKS9SJTHTU0OM,B008220DGE,K. Gordon,"[0, 0]","Perhaps our most fascinating American director continues his evolution in a fascinating and frustrating film that I view with a mix of feelings.It could well be argued that this is a step backwards from &#34;There Will Be Blood&#34;, and certainly, after 2 viewings, this lacks, for me the cohesivepower of the best of Anderson's earlier work.Some will just hate it. The pace is slow, the message often oblique, there's no catharsis, no easy answers. Just two riveting characters beinggiven riveting performances by two of our best actors, bouncing off each other, slowly giving us fragmentary glimpses into their souls.Philip Seymour Hoffman plays the Master, a charismatic charlatan quasi-religious leader who desperately needs adulation, and seems tohave long ago lost track of how much of what he says he really believes, and how much he's just making up as he goes along. JoaquinPhoenix plays Quell, an angry, possibly crazy young man suffering from what we'd probably now call PSTD after coming out of WW II.He seems to need a father figure as desperately as Hoffman's Lancaster Dodd needs to be adored as a father, so these two are drawntogether, and yet repelled as they both can see the damaged souls under the other's surface, and in the eyes of the other see the reflectionof their own wounds. So begins a non carnal love story between these two characters. Indeed, to me the film seems to be about love and howthe American male has such a hard time asking for it, accepting it, giving it or taking it in any direct manner, so we start religions or becomeacolytes (or become porn stars or heartless oil tycoons). The only thing these two polar opposites seem to have in common is that neitherof them can communicate without manipulation, or without burying their real meaning. And when they try to break through that, it inevitablypushes them apart.It's the tragedy of the American male, a theme Anderson has explored repeatedly (along with fathers and sons);we can't cope with our feelings,our vulnerability so we slowly pervert our need for love into quests for power, or violence, adulation, or domination or submissiveness. Whetherit's &#34;Hard 8&#34; or &#34;Boogie Nights&#34; or &#34;There Will Be Blood&#34;, Anderson's men are doomed by trying to be the men they think they have to be tosurvive, thus distorting their perceptions and their hearts.But there is a fuzziness here. One of Anderson's great strength as a film-maker has been his ability to make us sharply understand what's goingon viscerally, even if at moments it's hard to get on a literal level. But, at least for me, there were too many moments when I felt lost in the badway, not in a mystery, but a muddle. There are very interesting scenes, but in retrospect I'm not sure what some of them added to the story. Iexpected a second viewing to reveal greater depths, but for me instead it made the film feel a little more shallow, as if maybe some of the leapsin logic didn't actually have a point, but were just slightly unfocused storytelling.I would still urge anyone interested in film-making or acting to see it.

1544506,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B008220DGE,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[102, 116]","In an era when most studio movies are designed by consensus to appeal to the lowest common denominator, I have to acknowledge the true auteurs working within the system who are constructing distinctive and challenging projects.  That said, I am an absolute nut for Paul Thomas Anderson and his previous film efforts.  ""Boogie Nights,"" ""Magnolia"" and ""There Will Be Blood"" were all squarely on my favorites list in the respective years that they were released.  ""The Master,"" to my mind, was the can't miss proposition of the fall season.  While embraced by critics and awarded three Oscar nominations for its performances, the experience probably connected more with my mind than with my heart.  I'm thrilled that some people proclaim this a brilliant masterwork, but I'm not surprised by the negative reaction either.  It's a difficult movie that defies expectations at every turn.  I do credit Anderson with making his vision, in this case--it is not something that connected with me in that way that I had hoped.When I first heard of ""The Master,"" it was described as the first major film about Scientology that isn't really about Scientology.  Set in the 1950's, the story brings together a charismatic intellectual (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) and a troubled World War II veteran (Joaquin Phoenix).  Hoffman is the leader of a new religious order (some may say cult) designed to provide spiritual guidance for those they deem lost.  At first, Phoenix seems to welcome The Cause, as it is called, starting to fit in to the new movement.  But the more he learns and experiences, the more conflicted he becomes.  Is Hoffman a visionary or a charlatan?  When the two men play off one another, the film crackles with vitality.  Can Phoenix rise from the ashes to rebuild a semblance or normality or is he another lost cause?These are some of the questions that the screenplay flirts with.  In the end, though, ""The Master"" is never a movie that spells everything out for the viewer.  There are different ways that the film can be interpreted.  I found this approach intriguing as a mental exercise, but the movie remained too aloof to move me emotionally in the way that I might have liked.  Still, the performers are top notch.  Phoenix is impassioned and unpredictable, a powder keg ready to explode with little to no provocation.  Hoffman is steely and convincing.  Amy Adams plays a change-of-pace role as Hoffman's wife, a surprisingly understated leg to the film's central triangle.  Anderson proves, once again, that he's unafraid to buck the norm.  ""The Master"" isn't like any other film this year.  It's not a film to passively enjoy, but to actively engage in.  For serious minded film goers only, I respected ""The Master"" more than I loved it.

Joaquin Phoenix and Philip Seymour Hoffman were rightful lauded throughout the award season for their performances.  The cinematography works well here, making this movie feel both modern and period specific (in this case the 1950s).  My only real problem with the feel is that I don't understand it completely, but I don't hold that against it.  Paul Thomas Anderson's films have always been a bit oblique to me.  Even if I don't quite get all the messages that the film wants to deliver, I was enthralled throughout, mainly due to those acting performances that anchor the film.The DVD release is good (fantastic picture and audio), but I wish it had more special features.  I liked how the deleted scenes were presented.  Instead of just including the scenes, we get a 20 minute feature that edits together those scenes (including some alternate takes of existing scenes), while dialogue from the movie and music are layered throughout.  I found it to be a good way to present them.  There are also many teasers and trailers for this film included (16+ minutes worth).  Unfortunately there is only a short 8 minute behind the scenes feature, which doesn't go into the film-making process at all.  Instead it is just some footage of some of the sets and then some photos taken during filming.  It is interesting, but I was hoping for some more details on how the story came together or how the movie was shot.  Apparently the Blu-Ray has a 60 minute documentary on how WWII vets were given psychiatric treatments, but unfortunately that wasn't on the DVD.  There is a postcard with Philip Seymour Hoffman's picture on it (or rather, The Master's picture).If I had to rate the movie and DVD on Amazon's scale, I'd give the movie 4 stars out of 5 and the DVD 3 stars out of 5.

If you're coming in to this expecting a fluffy, sparkly tale where everything is wrapped up in a neat bow by the end or for pure entertainment purposes, you are sorely mistaken.This is a movie which unfolds slowly. The storyline, loosely based on the persona and ideas of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard (also channeled by the wonderful Philip Seymour Hoffman), deals with Hoffman's Lancaster Dodd taking troubled war veteran Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix) under his wing, as Dodd's ""Cause"" spreads its message across the country. Aided by his fierce wife Peggy (Amy Adams), the enigmatic Lancaster starts off friendly enough, until his message is questioned.So much has been said about the performances, but it really does bear repeating. The three main leads are incredible. Amy Adams brings a fright factor I never thought possible, since she usually plays perky, upbeat characters. I think Philip Seymour Hoffman brings his A-game with every project he's in, whether he's being silly or dramatic, and his interpretation of Lancaster Dodd is no exception. But the really standout performance here is Joaquin Phoenix. No stranger to making troubled characters come to life, Mr. Phoenix is flat out phenomenal in this role, one of his best to date.The cinematography is gorgeous.

1544518,A1YVPBDG2OFMD2,B008220DGE,Leif Sheppard,"[1, 2]","In a nutshell, THE MASTER tells the story of Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix), a strange alcoholic so consumed with sexual desire it borders on deviancy, who hobbles through his rather miserable existence with all the grace of a hunchback. A World War II veteran of the Pacific conflict, Quell ruins two post-war jobs because of his penchant for alcohol before stumbling aboard a ship while, you guessed it, inebriated. This ship happens to be owned (or, perhaps, commandeered) by Lancaster Dodd (Phillip Seymour Hoffman), a man every bit as odd as Quell, but significantly more charismatic and self-aware. I hesitate to use the term ""intelligent"", because that all becomes somewhat relative when you consider Dodd is the leader and mastermind behind a nutty cult he's dubbed ""The Cause"". Dodd sees an opportunity in Quell, to both treat the troubled man with his unorthodox methods and simultaneously reap the benefits of Quell's habit of making rotgut beverages.This isn't a film I would recommend for the narrative, because apart from an excellent first act, the film devolves into something meandering and frustratingly obtuse. Lengthy explorations of Dodd's 'therapy' for Quell are broken by the occasional assault Quell carries out on Dodd's critics, and apart from that the narrative is threadbare, choosing to focus on Dodd's Cause movement and the exploits of his collective, or lack thereof. Because by exploits, I mean squatting at the homes of people taken in by Dodd's charlatanism. There are some truly fantastic scenes, including a particularly articulate critic who confronts Dodd at a social gathering, but as the film moves along these become fewer until the last half hour is a bit of a slog. There are flashes of interesting characters, including one of Dodd's obsequious followers who begins to question The Cause, but this is never really explored. The film instead remains entrenched in detailing the odd relationship between Dodd and Quell to the very end.This is a film to watch solely for the performances by the cast as they are uniformly excellent. The cinematography is beautiful and the production design is superlative, but I found the score grating and often intrusive. The film would have been better served by nixing the score and leaving the wonderfully selected licensed music tracks.

Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Joaquin Phoenix are two of the most talented actors around today. Predictably, they turned in stellar performances. And the cinematography is at times breathtaking. Unfortunately, this project was a pointless failure. There is almost no plot whatsoever; there is only a collection of loosely fitting vignettes. The character that Phoenix had to play was so unredeemable, so hopelessly far gone into addictions and vice that it was painful to watch. And for some odd reason, the character played by Phoenix is also a physically repulsive hunchback whose posture is reminiscent of an 80-year old man; plus, he mumbles too much and you can't understand much of what he says. His alcoholism looks like it will take his life any day now, very soon, and yet, the character is so seedy the viewer wouldn't mind seeing him die off so the movie can continue without him--yet, there's nothing redeeming in the movie, either.The movie neither portrays a very negative image of L. Ron Hubbard, nor does it cast a very positive image of L. Rob Hubbard. Nor does it portray any kind of historical explanation of the origins of L. Ron Hubbard (whose OTO/Jack Parsons affiliations would make for a MUCH more interesting movie, but good luck having THAT uncomfortable history see the light of day!). But Hoffman's character is most definitely more than vaguely based on L. Ron Hubbard. So what's the point?There was no point. There was no point, other than to waste two hours of my life.And who cares about a homeless crazy decrepit drunk joining a cult anyway? Those aren't the kind of guys that Hubbard and other cult leaders pursue! No, they want the rich and famous dupes.

He pulled it off by making it very alligorical. Its not really a good film so much as a series of isolated scenes of tremendous quality. Its problem is that the alligorical approach means it doesn't really work in terms of telling a compelling overall story. Its an interesting and very challenging work.In my opinion, what this film is really about is the strange friendship between Errol Flynn toward the end of his life and L. Ron Hubbard. Its the story of two self-destructive men who are each walling themselves out of the world in different ways. Each man is the last ""ordinary"" person that the other will interact with. Errol Flynn, in the 1950s, had all the self-destructive attributes of the Joaquin Phoenix character. While the character is not a match for Flynn's personal charm, he is an incredibly close match in terms of Hubbard's personal history. If he isn't meant to be Flynn, the origins of the character concept seem to have been in Flynn. The ending in England also seems to parallel events as well.The friendship ends because neither man can function in the real world anymore and neither man can go back. The system around Hoffman both isolates and enables him. The anti-social behavior of Joaquin Phoenix will isolate him as well.The film is at its best when Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Joaquin Phoenix are playing off each other. The scenes were Phoenix is the silent observer in the shadows of the world Hoffman is building around himself are interesting. The worst bits are those where they repetitively establish the self-destructive personality of the Joaquin Phoenix character.I dont know how much of a broad appeal this has though. I could appreciate it because I was familiar with all the history involved. But its less clear what anyone who came into this fresh would get out of it other than the great acting in the Hoffman/Phoenix scenes. On the other hand, a certain group will find it difficult to really hate because they will not be able to understand it.Anderson was able to make a film that practically speaking could not be made. But its in a form that few will seemingly be able to understand. Its almost Oliver Stone's ""Wild Palms"" all over again.

1544541,A244Z9GPMIFOGK,B008220DGE,McGill,"[2, 5]","Paul Thomas Anderson's latest film begins with introductory sketchlike shots of Freddie Quell, a WWII soldier who it seems has spent a little too much time overseas.  The opening minutes of the movie reveal that he's freakishly obsessed with sex, has a serious drinking problem and very likely has nothing waiting for him back in the States.  His comrades feed his weaknesses gleefully, happy as schoolchildren to see the mindless animal perform.  Quell, borderline insane perhaps, goes home with his fellow soldiers sometime after we see him take great lengths to make moonshine.  After failing to keep a jobs as a department store photographer or as a farmer, Quell slips onto a yacht commanded by Lancaster Dodd.  Dodd claims to be many things--writer, doctor, physicist, philosopher--and says he knows about Quell's juice and has tried it and likes it very much and wants some more.  (This is an off-brand of booze that Quell has made with paint thinner.)  So a sort of bond is formed between the two men; the aimless Quell has nothing better to do than get schnozzed and do physical labor for Dodd, and Dodd sees something in Quell that he may be able to use in his life's work, ""The Cause,"" a movement which asks its followers to recall past lives in order to discover the answers to problems in their present states.The dark heart of the movie is the relationship between the unstable Quell and the charismatic Dodd.  Likened to L. Ron Hubbard by rumor-starters before Anderson's movie had even been shown once, Lancaster Dodd is wonderfully portrayed by Hollywood's great big man, Philip Seymour Hoffman, who smiles through his mustache at just the right moments to his character's listeners, and asks deeply personal questions to newcomers, unflinching to their responses.  As mysterious and layered as Dodd may be (and by the way, Hoffman's simply in top form), it's Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of the mumbling, frightening, possibly shell-shocked veteran Freddie Quell that will leave you astounded.  (If it's one nominee who could've rivaled Daniel Day-Lewis for the Oscar, it's Phoenix by far, and this lowly reviewer dares say the man was robbed.)  Phoenix simply disappears into the role; gone are the evil cool of his performance as Commodus in Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"" and the troubled badassery of Johnny Cash in ""Walk the Line.""  Here Phoenix plays a dangerous half-monster of a man, a curled-lip wino who simply can't get his act together and more or less doesn't care.  He has nothing to do, nothing to lose, nothing to believe in but the prescriptive demands of those around him, be it Dodd or Dodd's wife Peggy (played Amy Adams whose girl-next-door face makes the character really get to you when she does the things she does to the two lead males).  And a man with these qualities is unpredictable.What ""The Master"" is really about, thinks this worthless reviewer, is not ""The Cause"" or Lancaster Dodd or hardly even Freddie Quell, those it is arguably the latter character's story, but rather the battle one of them fights to keep him on a self-medicated track, and the attempt the other makes to stay in the left lane forever and do simply what he wants.  Which, you really have to hand it to Quell, since he doesn't seem to really live anywhere but with his hosts, themselves hosted.  The Dodds and their crew don't pay rent or for groceries; they make appearances, perform and are given the Rain Man suites.  Quell simply goes with the flow.  At first he looks more or less convinced that the experiences Dodd's patients are real, and then calls Dodd a fake when they are both thrown in prison (this happens a little after Dodd's own fresh-faced son whose actor's looks actually bear a resemblance to Hoffman's tells Quell the man's making things up as he goes).  All in all it doesn't matter if ""The Cause"" is BS or not.  What's more interesting is whether Quell thinks it is.  And what's more interesting than that is, after all of the troubling, furrow-eyed spectacles Anderson will show you with his new movie, whether Quell, man at man's worst, will try to help himself.",5,"You Can't Take This Life Straight, Can You?",1362009600,"02 28, 2013",2013,4106,"['Paul', 'Thomas', 'Anderson', 'latest', 'film', 'introductory', 'sketchlike', 'shots', 'Freddie', 'Quell', 'WWII', 'soldier', 'who', 'spent', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'overseas', 'opening', 'minutes', 'movie', 'reveal', 'freakishly', 'obsessed', 'sex', 'serious', 'drinking', 'problem', 'very', 'likely', 'nothing', 'waiting', 'back', 'States', 'comrades', 'feed', 'weaknesses', 'gleefully', 'happy', 'schoolchildren', 'see', 'mindless', 'animal', 'perform', 'Quell', 'borderline', 'insane', 'perhaps', 'home', 'fellow', 'soldiers', 'sometime', 'see', 'take', 'great', 'lengths', 'make', 'moonshine', 'failing', 'keep', 'jobs', 'department', 'store', 'photographer', 'farmer', 'Quell', 'yacht', 'commanded', 'Lancaster', 'Dodd', 'Dodd', 'be', 'many', 'things', 'writer', 'doctor', 'physicist', 'philosopher', 'Quell', 'juice', 'tried', 'very', 'much', 'more', 'off-brand', 'booze', 'Quell', 'made', 'paint', 'thinner', 'sort', 'bond', 'formed', 'two', 'men', 'aimless', 'Quell', 'nothing', 'better', 'do', 'get', 'schnozzed', 'do', 'physical', 'labor', 'Dodd', 'Dodd', 'something', 'Quell', 'may', 'be', 'able', 'use', 'life', 'work', 'Cause', 'movement', 'followers', 'recall', 'past', 'lives', 'order', 'discover', 'answers', 'problems', 'present', 'states.The', 'dark', 'heart', 'movie', 'relationship', 'unstable', 'Quell', 'charismatic', 'Dodd', 'Likened', 'L.', 'Ron', 'Hubbard', 'rumor-starters', 'Anderson', 'movie', 'had', 'even', 'been', 'shown', 'once', 'Lancaster', 'Dodd', 'wonderfully', 'portrayed', 'Hollywood', 'great', 'big', 'man', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'who', 'mustache', 'just', 'right', 'moments', 'character', 'listeners', 'deeply', 'personal', 'questions', 'newcomers', 'unflinching', 'responses', 'mysterious', 'layered', 'Dodd', 'may', 'be', 'way', 'Hoffman', 'simply', 'top', 'form', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'portrayal', 'mumbling', 'frightening', 'possibly', 'shell-shocked', 'veteran', 'Freddie', 'Quell', 'will', 'leave', 'astounded', 'one', 'nominee', 'who', 'could', ""'ve"", 'rivaled', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'Oscar', 'Phoenix', 'far', 'lowly', 'reviewer', 'dares', 'say', 'man', 'was', 'robbed', 'Phoenix', 'simply', 'role', 'gone', 'are', 'evil', 'cool', 'performance', 'Commodus', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'Gladiator', 'troubled', 'badassery', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'Walk', 'Line', 'Here', 'Phoenix', 'dangerous', 'half-monster', 'man', 'curled-lip', 'wino', 'who', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'act', 'together', 'more', 'less', ""n't"", 'care', 'nothing', 'do', 'nothing', 'lose', 'nothing', 'believe', 'prescriptive', 'demands', 'be', 'Dodd', 'Dodd', 'wife', 'Peggy', 'played', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'girl-next-door', 'face', 'character', 'really', 'get', 'when', 'things', 'two', 'lead', 'males', 'man', 'qualities', 'Master', 'really', 'about', 'worthless', 'reviewer', 'not', 'Cause', 'Lancaster', 'Dodd', 'hardly', 'even', 'Freddie', 'Quell', 'arguably', 'latter', 'character', 'story', 'rather', 'battle', 'one', 'fights', 'keep', 'self-medicated', 'track', 'attempt', 'other', 'stay', 'left', 'lane', 'forever', 'do', 'simply', 'what', 'Which', 'really', 'have', 'hand', 'Quell', ""n't"", 'seem', 'really', 'live', 'anywhere', 'hosts', 'hosted', 'Dodds', 'crew', 'do', ""n't"", 'pay', 'rent', 'groceries', 'make', 'appearances', 'perform', 'are', 'given', 'Rain', 'Man', 'Quell', 'simply', 'flow', 'first', 'more', 'less', 'convinced', 'experiences', 'Dodd', 'patients', 'are', 'real', 'then', 'Dodd', 'fake', 'when', 'are', 'thrown', 'prison', 'little', 'Dodd', 'own', 'fresh-faced', 'son', 'actor', 'looks', 'actually', 'bear', 'resemblance', 'Hoffman', 'tells', 'Quell', 'man', 'making', 'things', 'up', ""n't"", 'matter', 'Cause', 'BS', 'not', 'What', 'more', 'interesting', 'Quell', 'what', 'more', 'interesting', 'troubling', 'furrow-eyed', 'spectacles', 'Anderson', 'will', 'show', 'new', 'movie', 'Quell', 'man', 'man', 'worst', 'will', 'try', 'help']",N/A

What Paul Thomas Anderson pulls off here is nothing short of miraculous, and with a stunning performance from Joaquin Phoenix, there are no moments throughout its 143 minute running time that won't leave you fascinated.  With a fantastic score from Johnny Greenwood, Anderson has proven without a doubt that he is our modern day Kubrick.Comparing Anderson to Kubrick is irresponsible in many ways considering the differences in their styles.  The one most significant thread joining the two, though, is their uncanny knack for telling a story.  When an Anderson or Kubrick movie comes on the screen, there is no way you're turning it off.  Kubrick pulled off this magic by his eye for detail and visual sense, while Anderson truly has a gift of casting the perfect cast to unfold his tales.  Phoenix runs the show here, and wow, does he ever.  Phoenix's talent is no secret to anyone, but even I was surprised at the level of emotion and depth he was able to conjure in The Master.  He deserved an Oscar for this performance, pure and simple.  Philip Seymour Hoffman and Amy Adams are fine, but when Phoenix is on the screen, it's captivating to say the absolute least.Like with all Anderson films, there is no resolution, no happy and pat ending, and no major questions have been answered.  The director is proving to be the master of character study, and his sensitive eye and gift for story telling will leave moments of humor, shock, and melancholy with the viewer that won't leave for days.Greenwood's scores complement Anderson's vision perfectly, and give the films a sense of obtuse beauty that can't be explained.  The two create landscapes and soundscapes that defy definition in the realm of film.The closing shot of The Master is one of the most beautiful and disturbing conjurations I've ever seen in a movie, and I thought about it for days after I first saw it.  I've watched the film twice since, and it has lost none of its resonance.

Written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, this compelling, albeit imperfect film, is set in the early 1950s and casts Hoffman in the title role: a charismatic L.

Much of the film's action is viewed through his distorted perspective.On the road with no means of support, Phoenix stumbles upon Hoffman's organization, is drawn in and soon becomes his lieutenant, willing to resort to violence in order to protect his mentor.  Phoenix is excellent in the picture's central role, which is, actually, much showier than Hoffman's, yet when the pair share the screen, your eyes go to Hoffman.Also in the cast is Amy Adams, quite effective as Hoffman's cold, pragmatic wife; a role unlike the more perky characters she has played in the past.My problem with THE MASTER is that, in the theatrical version, the purpose and underlying philosophy of ""The Cause,"" Hoffman's organization, is never made clear.  Yet, in the ""Deleted Scenes"" that are among the extras on the Blu-Ray/DVD combo from Anchor Bay Entertainment, there is a scene in which the philosophy is explained so that the layman viewer can understand it.  It is unfortunate that this scene did not make the final cut in the film itself.Paul Thomas Anderson is a fine filmmaker and, like his earlier works (e.g. THERE WILL BE BLOOD, MAGNOLIA), THE MASTER is involving and enigmatic.  Its convoluted ending will certainly have you asking questions.  Yet, despite these reservations, what makes this movie worth watching are the Oscar-caliber performances by Hoffman, Phoenix and Adams.Also on the Blu-Ray/DVD is the legendary John Huston documentary, LET THERE BE LIGHT, which dealt with emotionally damaged WW2 veterans and was a strong influence on Anderson in the making of this picture.

In that, they are more like the books of novelists such as David Foster Wallace then like any movies currently being made (at least in America). ""The Master"" isn't the most elusive of Anderson's movies--for me, that will always be ""Magnolia""--but it will separate the Anderson lovers from the Anderson haters, with a large subgroup of viewers scratching their heads, unsure what they think of the movie but also unable to get it out of their minds.""The Master"" begins with the story of Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix), a shell-shocked sailor whose World War II service leaves him a feckless, sex-obsessed drunk. After various misadventures, he ends up by accident in the circle of Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a charismatic, self-proclaimed genius who loves Freddie's ability to create potent potables from whatever chemicals he has at hand. The rest of the story concerns Freddie's induction into Dodd's cult and the strange, love-hate relationship that develops between the two men.To say anything more about the plot after Freddie and Dodd's meeting would be giving away too much. It isn't just that the events are difficult to summarize; it's also that it would spoil the sheer, unadulterated shock Anderson wants the audience to feel. (Hint: you'll never regard the old folk song, ""I'll Go No More A-Roving,"" the same way again.) You may or may not like what Anderson presents, but you will not be bored. At the very least, Phoenix and Hoffman alone will keep you fascinated. If there's such a thing as bravura acting, it's what Phoenix and Hoffman do here. One brief scene, with Phoenix and Hoffman side-by-side in adjacent jail cells, alone is enough to establish both actors' claims for this year's Best Actor Oscar. (How will the Academy ever choose between them? After all, there have only been two ties in the Academy's history.)The closest I can come to describing the theme of ""The Master"" is that it concerns two recognizable American types: one who seeks to bind others to him, and another who cannot be bound. It turns out to be a bigger theme than one movie can contain, but Anderson makes an honorable effort, and to my mind a thrilling one. You be the judge.

The only time this approach has come close to working was 2007's ""There Will Be Blood"", which made no sense on any level but featured a darkly hilarious caricature by Daniel Day Lewis, whose talent was, incredibly, able to carry the whole mess. This time, it is left to Joaquin Phoenix and Philip Seymour Hoffman to carry the weight. Perhaps Hoffman could have, if his character had better dialogue and made a habit of histrionics, like Lewis' did.Shortly after World War II, navy veteran Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix) returns from the Pacific theater and finds it difficult to navigate everyday life. The Navy psychiatrists said he had a nervous disorder, which we would call post-traumatic stress, but Freddie was not entirely well to begin with. Now he's an alcoholic prone to violent outbursts who leaves a string of jobs in a hurry, until he stumbles upon a yacht belonging to one Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman). Dodd calls himself a ""scientist and a connoisseur"". He likes to help people with their problems, which he believes can be solved through past life regression. And he takes Freddie on as a ""guinea pig and prot&eacute;g&eacute;."" Freddie embarks on a life dedicated to ""The Cause"" and its master, Lancaster Dodd.Joaquin Phoenix received a Best Actor Academy Award nomination for his role. Hoffman and Amy Adams received nominations for ""supporting"" roles. Dodd is actually a principle character. Adams plays his outwardly sweet but privately ferocious wife. Freddie isn't credible at all, but that is consistent with Paul Thomas Anderson's ""style"". Joaquin Phoenix is conspicuously too old for the role -which hardly matters, as he's not believable anyway. But this is a physically demanding performance from Phoenix, whose manner is gaunt and hunched to the point of being grotesque. I have always thought that Philip Seymour Hoffman should give up the frumpy roles, as he would make the perfect sly, ruthless villain. He almost achieves that here, but the character is too flat.There is not a lot to be said about the narrative, except that it is nearly 2 hours and 20 minutes long and contains a lot of filler. ""The Master"" aspires to be a character study of people who don't come across as real characters but are not cartoonish enough to entertain. All of the significant female characters are redheads. I wonder what that means. I'm afraid that's the most tantalizing question that ""The Master"" will elicit. It's one of those movies that critics like, because they can't understand it, and they're afraid that someone else does. But there's nothing to understand.The DVD (Western Film Company 2013): Bonus features include 8 teasers and 1 theatrical trailer (16:30 minutes total), a short film called ""Unguided Message"" (8 min) that takes us behind the scenes, and ""Back Beyond"" (20 min), another short film of outtakes and additional scenes that have been strung together in a semi-coherent fashion and set to music by Jonny Greenwood.

Oleson,"[2, 6]","Come awards season, I certainly expect some acting nods to come to Joaquin Phoenix and Philip Seymour Hoffman for this Paul Thomas Anderson film saga.  Unfortunately for me, in spite of some great performances and technically wonderful artistry, I had problems with the story and where it was headed.In a long opening sequence, and on the eve of the end of World War II, Freddie Quell (Phoenix) is about to be discharged from the Navy.  His unusual behavior is questioned by the medical staff, but he is ultimately turned loose on society.  While in the Navy, he learned how to distill his own brand of hooch depending on what ingredients were available.  This includes a base of about anything that burns.  After a couple failed job opportunities due to his alcoholism, he stumbles upon a yacht being used by Lancaster Dodd (Hoffman), his family and an assortment of followers.Dodd is a successful leader of a new movement called ""The Cause"" which has a basic premise of individuals having past and future embodiment.  Dodd, known as Master by his followers, takes a liking to Quell and agrees to ""treat"" him for his need for booze as well as his violent and unpredictable behavior.  But why?  Is he so convinced of his beliefs and his ""healing"" power that he can convert Quell?  Is Dodd just a charlatan looking for a public example?  Or is there something more? There are no obvious answers although I have my own theory.While it is certainly not unusual for Thomas to take his time laying out his characters and the story, this time it didn't seem necessary.  Certainly of note is an excellent supporting cast including Amy Adams as Mrs. Dodd, Jesse Plemons as the son and Laura Dern as a financial supporter. The film is also buoyed by an excellent score written by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood.  Like most of Anderson's films, this one may resonate better upon an additional viewing.",3,3 1/2 stars for a P.

Characters are irritating, pacing is slow, and the plot is pieced together through flashbacks and the occasional hallucination. The movie will frustrate some and absorb others, but the gorgeous cinematography, evocative music, and fantastic acting make it a film worth seeing. Though much of the movie may be baffling, it raises valid questions about the human condition.The story follows Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix), an alcoholic and addled veteran of World War II. He stumbles across philosopher Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and his group of followers. Lancaster, everything Freddie is not, takes him under his wing and teaches him about ""The Cause,"" a way of living which includes acknowledging past lives.Phoenix is astounding as Freddie, an embodiment of the id. His poisonous moonshine exacerbates his mental disorders. Unusual for the movies, he is completely unglamorous. Freddie's hunched over, thin form and gnarled but enthralling face contrast with Lancaster's paunchy figure and composed expression. Hoffman is, of course, excellent. Amy Adams (or her character) is slightly over-the-top as Lancaster's uncompassionate and creepy wife Peggy.Freddie's existence disproves Lancaster's mantra, ""Man is not an animal,"" which may be why Lancaster is so drawn to him. Freddie is by and large loyal to Lancaster, dangerously so. Their relationship is a strange love story of sorts. In the end, though, Freddie is his own man, a chaotic force of nature. Will the brainwashing techniques of The Cause work on him?Deep, dark colors emphasize a sense of post-war paranoia, and the unique cinematography and music emphasize how strange people are. Everyone is searching for some kind of truth, be it through control or a connection.

In this one, Anderson examines the lives of Freddie Quell (played by Joaquin Phoenix), a down on his luck loser-like WW II veteran who has major trouble adjusting to life after the war. Much of the movie takes place in 1950. After drifting around, Quell drunkenly stumbles onto a ship where Lancaster Dodd (played by Philip Seymour Hoffman) is holding court. We soon find out that Dodd is the leader of a cult-like movement called The Cause, and as directionless as he is, Quell soon becomes part of the movement.Much has been made about whether this movie is a thin-veiled tale of/take on the Scientologist movement, but for me that is really besides the point. The movie instead focuses on the inter-relationship between Quell and Dodd, and at that, the movie truly shines. Yes, Philip Seymour Hoffman brings a great performance as the Cause leader, but Joaquin Phoenix simply blows everyone off the screen with his jaw-dropping performance. You may recall that he seemingly went off the deep end, and then some, in 2008-2009, captured in ""I'm Still Here"", only later to be revealed as just yet another performance. There are scenes in ""The Master"" that reveal/confirm Phoenix as being one of the best male actors of this time, check out the scene where he is jailed along with Hoffman, and Phoenix just goes beserk, just wow. As an aside for Radiohead fans, Jonny Greenwood scored the musical soundtrack (as he did in Anderson's 2007 ""There Will Be Blood"").The movie concludes on an open-ended note, and I suppose that is just right, as there can be no clear conclusion for these flawed characters. But more so than the story are the amazing performances in this movie. Besides the lead actors, Amy Adams also brings a steely, yet brilliant performance as the wife of Dodd.

When he meets Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman), the ""master"" of ""The Cause"", he succumbs to the charismatic leader who attempts to tame Freddie's animal nature. Perhaps in the end, the entire film is about the notion that one cannot change their true nature, although that assessment may seem too simplistic. The film, however, is frustrating in that it fails to fully explain just what Dodd's group is trying to accomplish or what their philosophy is.The film does have a mesmerizing quality which is achieved by the terrific acting (although some may find that the actors are trying too hard). Hoffman is very effective as Dodd and one of the best scenes in the film is a powerful session between him and Phoenix as they go through a ""processing"" interview. Phoenix hunches his shoulders, scrunches his face and walks around with his hands on his hips in a physical transformation that is sometimes unintentionally humorous (a friend says he reminded him of Martin Short's character, Ed Grimley) but he matches Hoffman's intensity and their relationship in the film is believable.In the end, this is probably a film that deserves more than one viewing to grasp some of its meanings.

It also harkens to an earlier time of visionary prophets of the late 1800's early 1900's (Baker Eddy, White).I loved Hoffman's take on the role and his live in the moment portrayal of the charismatic leader. The Amy Adams role was darker and I thought she handled a fairly small role very well. Phoenix was wonderful in the lost man role. As in so many of these movements you are either in 100% or left behind.Overall, enjoyable and thought provoking.

Philip Seymour Hoffman and Joaquin Phoenix both deliver Oscar worthy performances. Stylistically, the movie is similar to Paul Thomas Anderson's previous film, 2007's &#34;There Will Be Blood&#34; but is perhaps less accessible. The movie's often mesmerizing and delivers quite an emotional wallop. But it lacks a strong narrative. It feels more episodic and leaves it to the viewer to make up his or her own mind as to what its message is and what its characters are about. Phoenix completely transforms himself into Freddie Quell while Hoffman impresses with his charismatic and well rounded portrayal of the Master himself, Lancaster Dodd. Amy Adams is also very good as Dodd's wife. Watching the Blu-ray, I found the movie just as hypnotic as it was in theaters. There are several sequences in the movie which are just thrilling to watch. The combination of superb acting, writing, editing, music, and Anderson's precise direction prove endlessly fascinating. Each viewing provides a new perspective on the film's characters and meanings.The Blu-ray features a stunning transfer. The movie was largely shot in 65mm and the Blu-ray presents a film-like image with minimal grain but staggering detail, sharpness, and depth. The audio is immersive as well, presenting Jonny Greenwood's propulsive rhythmic score, the dialogue, and classic songs with great clarity.I appreciate Paul Thomas Anderson's control over his films' home video releases from the cover art & packaging down to the very simple menus. There's none of the typical promotional ads and mumbo jumbo found on this disc. The Blu-ray features a 20-minute montage of deleted scenes set to Greenwood's score, trailers and promos, behind the scenes footage, and John Huston's documentary &#34;Let There Be Light&#34; which inspired the movie. The disc lacks a commentary or relevant interviews with the cast & crew. I respect Anderson's decision to let the film speak for itself, but I would have welcomed a good discussion of the film. For example, there are a couple great Q&As; with the director and cast up on YouTube.",5,"A mesmerizing film, excellent video & audio",1366416000,"04 20, 2013",2013,2199,"['34', 'Master', '34', 'was', 'favorite', 'film', '2012', 'likely', 'not', 'everyone', 'taste', 'acting', 'amazing', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'deliver', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'performances', 'Stylistically', 'movie', 'similar', 'Paul', 'Thomas', 'Anderson', 'previous', 'film', '2007', '34', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', '34', 'perhaps', 'less', 'accessible', 'movie', 'often', 'mesmerizing', 'delivers', 'quite', 'emotional', 'wallop', 'strong', 'narrative', 'more', 'episodic', 'viewer', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'mind', 'what', 'message', 'what', 'characters', 'are', 'Phoenix', 'completely', 'Freddie', 'Quell', 'Hoffman', 'charismatic', 'well', 'rounded', 'portrayal', 'Master', 'Lancaster', 'Dodd', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'Dodd', 'wife', 'Watching', 'Blu-ray', 'found', 'movie', 'just', 'as', 'hypnotic', 'was', 'theaters', 'are', 'several', 'sequences', 'movie', 'are', 'just', 'thrilling', 'watch', 'combination', 'superb', 'acting', 'writing', 'editing', 'music', 'Anderson', 'precise', 'direction', 'prove', 'endlessly', 'fascinating', 'viewing', 'new', 'perspective', 'film', 'characters', 'meanings.The', 'Blu-ray', 'stunning', 'transfer', 'movie', 'was', 'largely', 'shot', '65mm', 'Blu-ray', 'presents', 'film-like', 'image', 'minimal', 'grain', 'staggering', 'detail', 'sharpness', 'depth', 'audio', 'immersive', 'as', 'well', 'presenting', 'Jonny', 'Greenwood', 'propulsive', 'rhythmic', 'score', 'dialogue', 'classic', 'songs', 'great', 'clarity.I', 'appreciate', 'Paul', 'Thomas', 'Anderson', 'control', 'films', 'home', 'video', 'cover', 'art', 'packaging', 'down', 'very', 'simple', 'menus', 'none', 'typical', 'promotional', 'ads', 'mumbo', 'jumbo', 'found', 'disc', 'Blu-ray', 'features', '20-minute', 'montage', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'set', 'Greenwood', 'score', 'trailers', 'promos', 'scenes', 'footage', 'John', 'Huston', 'documentary', '34', 'Let', 'Be', 'Light', '34', 'inspired', 'movie', 'disc', 'commentary', 'relevant', 'interviews', 'cast', 'crew', 'respect', 'Anderson', 'decision', 'let', 'film', 'speak', 'would', 'have', 'welcomed', 'good', 'discussion', 'film', 'example', 'are', 'couple', 'great', 'Q', 'As', 'director', 'cast', 'up', 'YouTube']",N/A
1544578,AJRFZ0VZ0LD26,B008220DGE,"Reader ""Eugenia""","[3, 5]","I wanted to see this movie since it first came out.  Everyone was praising Phillip Seymour's performance.  I must say Joaquin Phoenix delivers one of the best performance of his career.  These two strong actors are true match and they battle it out on the screen from start to end of this movie.This story is set in 1950s America.  WWII is over, but many veterns are still struggling with their post traumatic experiences.  Not to mention that many of them feel left out on the personal level.  Women they loved married other people and America is so concerned about the cold war and threat of Communism that society completely overlooks its veterans.  Freddie is former navy officer, shaken by the war.  He has no immediate family and girl he loved is married to someone else and has two children.  Freddie has no education and no calling and his displacement leads him to drinking that eases his emotional pain.  Very few have an understanding for Freddie's lifestyle, so he drifts from place to place unable to hold on to jobs, women and friendships.  Until one day, he comes across Lancaster Dodd (played by Seymour), so called Master who proclaims that he can help anyone find their true self in this lifetime and get read of their traumas that are sometimes carried to this life from the past lives.Dodd is complete opposite of Freddie.  He is educated, flamboyant, man who has been married many times and has many children.  He is also a fraud, manipulative scoundrel who uses people's (emotional) weaknesses and insecurities to make his own living.  Freddie is perfect specimen for Dodd's ""presentations"" about healing past traumas in order to gain new beginning free of burdens.I was amazed how savage both of these men are.  And each one of them expresses it differently.  Freddie is volatile, unable to contain his rage at the world.  Uneducated and vulnerable, the only way he knows how to express his emotions is through fist fight.  Dodd on the other way is manipulative and cruel and uses other people to achieve his own selfish means.Do not expect straight forward ending of this movie.  I am convinced that director wanted every person to make their own version of what happens to these characters. But I loved the fact that at the end of it all, Freddie is able to stand his own and create his own Cause - even if it means that he is the only one following it.  Perhaps that is the strength he was seeking all along.",5,Fabulous movie for a select few that get it,1376611200,"08 16, 2013",2013,2434,"['wanted', 'see', 'movie', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'Everyone', 'was', 'praising', 'Phillip', 'Seymour', 'performance', 'must', 'say', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'one', 'best', 'performance', 'career', 'two', 'strong', 'actors', 'are', 'true', 'match', 'battle', 'out', 'screen', 'start', 'end', 'movie.This', 'story', 'set', '1950s', 'America', 'WWII', 'many', 'veterns', 'are', 'still', 'struggling', 'post', 'traumatic', 'experiences', 'Not', 'mention', 'many', 'feel', 'left', 'out', 'personal', 'level', 'loved', 'married', 'other', 'people', 'America', 'so', 'concerned', 'cold', 'war', 'threat', 'Communism', 'society', 'completely', 'veterans', 'Freddie', 'former', 'navy', 'officer', 'shaken', 'war', 'immediate', 'family', 'girl', 'loved', 'married', 'someone', 'else', 'two', 'children', 'Freddie', 'education', 'calling', 'displacement', 'drinking', 'emotional', 'pain', 'Very', 'few', 'have', 'understanding', 'Freddie', 'lifestyle', 'place', 'place', 'unable', 'hold', 'jobs', 'women', 'friendships', 'one', 'day', 'Lancaster', 'Dodd', 'played', 'Seymour', 'so', 'called', 'Master', 'who', 'can', 'help', 'anyone', 'find', 'true', 'self', 'lifetime', 'get', 'read', 'traumas', 'are', 'sometimes', 'carried', 'life', 'past', 'lives.Dodd', 'complete', 'opposite', 'Freddie', 'educated', 'flamboyant', 'man', 'who', 'been', 'married', 'many', 'times', 'many', 'children', 'also', 'fraud', 'manipulative', 'scoundrel', 'who', 'people', 'emotional', 'weaknesses', 'insecurities', 'make', 'own', 'living', 'Freddie', 'perfect', 'specimen', 'Dodd', 'presentations', 'healing', 'past', 'traumas', 'order', 'gain', 'new', 'beginning', 'free', 'burdens.I', 'was', 'amazed', 'how', 'savage', 'men', 'are', 'one', 'differently', 'Freddie', 'volatile', 'unable', 'contain', 'rage', 'world', 'Uneducated', 'vulnerable', 'only', 'way', 'how', 'express', 'emotions', 'fist', 'fight', 'Dodd', 'other', 'way', 'manipulative', 'cruel', 'other', 'people', 'achieve', 'own', 'selfish', 'means.Do', 'not', 'expect', 'straight', 'forward', 'ending', 'movie', 'am', 'convinced', 'director', 'wanted', 'person', 'make', 'own', 'version', 'what', 'characters', 'loved', 'fact', 'end', 'Freddie', 'able', 'stand', 'own', 'create', 'own', 'Cause', 'even', 'only', 'one', 'following', 'Perhaps', 'strength', 'was', 'seeking', 'along']",N/A

More Qs than As abound, running on a parallel track as the movie unfolds and unwinds: who is the Master, what does he want, what is the recipe for Freddie's elixir, why does Freddie laugh just like Dennis Hopper, are the women really naked whilst the Master sings a sea shanty, what does the Operating Thetan of Tom Cruise who starred in another movie by this same director think of this one, have any of those involved in this movie attained or even come close to being Clear, if one never knew a darn thing about L. Ron Hubbard would this movie make any sense or even hold any interest at all, how does the Master find Freddie whilst Freddie is watching Casper movies in a theater - or is this just Freddie's drunk dream, and if it is truly a dream how are we supposed to realize that,and is man a spirit or a wind-breaking animal, why was the truly powerful music by Rachmaninoff used in the promos not used as score for this movie, why did the Master bury his unpublished works in the desert, why doesn't Freddie just break the glass window we see him touch and caress and describe a seemingly infinite amount of times, why does the Master really want to get Freddie on a slow boat to China and why does this film end at the beginning with Freddie and the lady made of sand on the beach?Who knows?  Who cares?  Should we know?  Should we care?I suppose that is writer and director Paul Thomas Anderson's point, to make people talk and think afterwards and try to figure out what it was all about.  Is it just junk - or is it a genuine jewel - or a bit of both, as is the Master, as was L. Ron Hubbard, the Hearst to this Kane.  Most people seek, no, crave answers.  Most people search and yearn, and live and die for a Master - or a God - to gift them and guide them. But is there ever truly a Master with all the answers?  By film's end, certainly not.  The Wizard, alas, is a small man behind a curtain we were advised to ignore. We see that the Master's master is his wife who deftly displays her mastery of the Master in the scene at the sink wherein she takes matters into her own had.  And the Master, I think, reveals his thralldom to Freddie in their final scene together, the ""slow boat to china"" moment that elicits tears from Freddie as he realizes the roles have been reversed and perhaps have always been so - and he weeps with realization that the Master and he never ever met before - as he has been led to believe throughout the course of the story - never shared an earlier history, only in the Master's past-life imagination which may, in truth, be simply made up.  Freddie cries for the loss of a Master's love and guidance and the loss of being a part of something bigger than himself.  So he returns to the booze and ends up making long-delayed love to a bar pick-up, falling out of her with his mind elsewhere, parroting the interview practices of the now vanished Master, trying perhaps to become that which he lost - and ending the film with a Rosebud-type fixated memory of the lady made of sand, the Dream and Desire made of shifting sand, Freddie's Master is the Past, enslaved to the promise of love and hope gone by, adrift in an unspoken sense that the final Answer...is the first Question.Finally, whether watching this for the first time or watching it again after the loss of Philip Seymour Hoffman, one may well and rightly be moved to tears. And if not tears straight from the eyes, then surely from the heart.

1544589,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B008220DGE,RMurray847,"[3, 4]","I need to stop thinking that there's more to Paul Thomas Anderson's films.  I watched THERE WILL BE BLOOD with great interest and great admiration.  I wondered what it would all mean, since it was so clearly fraught with deep meaning and was going to make an amazing statement about...something.  Then came the final, odd scene in the bowling alley.  The film was suddenly over.  I had no deep insights.  Surely Anderson wasn't simply saying something about ""American corporate greed"" or how religion/money are tied together in unhealthy ways, or something vaguely disparaging about America's thirst for oil?  For all the incredible effort, all the obtuseness, all the meaningful glances and pauses...surely it wasn't as simplistic as all that?Then I watched THE MASTER.  Brilliantly acted and engrossing throughout.  Surely this wasn't just a simplistic statement about how some can be gullible about religion, or about how a cult develops, or even something about the American spirit yearning for fulfillment in the wake of WWII?  Then comes the final scene, and my heart was already fearful that this was going to be THERE WILL BE BLOOD, PT. 2...and sure enough, the final scene served to confuse and confound more than to enlighten.  This carefully crafted and intensely acted and FRAUGHT film really wasn't about anything terribly astute.Every time I dare to criticize an ""artsy"" film, I get feedback saying things like ""you're obviously too stupid to get this...stick to action films.""  Well, I still have to call them like I see them.  I've praised many ""artsy"" films, including some difficult ones like SYNECDOCHE, NY, which I picked as the best film of its year.  Or even A SERIOUS MAN.  These were tough films to glean meaning from...but they both left me FEELING something specific, as though I had experienced and internalized someone else's world view.  The great absurdist play WAITING FOR GODOT is very tough to assign specific meaning to...yet it makes you feel you've reached a greater understanding of the human condition WITHOUT needing to know exactly what was going on.  I say all this to defend my ultimate critique about THE MASTER, because I don't believe I'm dumb or closed to challenging movie experiences.I'm sorry, but THE MASTER is the ultimate Emperor-Has-No-Clothes movie.  I enjoyed 95% of it immensely, but when the Emperor had completely finished walking by, I was angry that he deliberately wanted to make me feel like an idiot because I thought he was dressed when he really wasn't.By all means, see the film.  It has gorgeous cinematography.  Wonderful costumes and a great sense of style.  It recreates post-WWII American sumptuously.  The music is grating but surprisingly effective.  Philip Seymour Hoffman is riveting.  Amy Adams shows us some new stuff.  And Joaquin Phoenix gives one of the most compelling, draining performances I've seen in ages.  Honestly, the performances alone make the film well worth seeing.Phoenix plays Freddie Quell, a deeply troubled sailor who emerges from WWII a wreck of a man.  Phoenix embodies this role so fully, I was simply amazed.  I'm not sure I've ever seen a character so uncomfortable in his own skin.  You can't keep your eyes off this angry, twitchy, oddly compelling man.  Especially when he's with Lancaster Dodd (Hoffman), the pseudo-scientific, pseudo-religious cult leader who pulls Freddie into his inner circle and dazzles him with his faux insights and psycho-babble.  This cult leader is a mass of contradictions himself...but what he does is convince those around him that he's had great insights, that he's so much smarter than everyone else around him and that if THEY can't understand HIM, it's only because THEY are having a failure of comprehension, not because the beautiful words he's spouting are complete malarkey.  (Kinda like I feel Anderson is treating his audience here.)Quell & Dodd's relationship evolves over the years (as does their relationship with Dodd's wife, played by Amy Adams).  There are ups and downs.  Fights and reconciliations.  Steps forwards and backwards.  For ALL the characters.  It's all quite gripping and Anderson has written a wordy yet always compelling script.  His cast tears into it with gusto.  Yet for all the great melodrama unfolding, Anderson keeps a tight rein on things, never losing control of his tone.Anderson IS a great filmmaker.  His BOOGIE NIGHTS is one of my favorite films.  MAGNOLIA, equally obtuse as his later work, worked for me in the same way the films I mention above like SYNECDOCHE, NY did.  They resonated on an emotional level.  But Anderson, with each film, seems to strive for some emotional detachment.  BOOGIE NIGHTS is frantic, joyful, energetic & fun.  MAGNOLIA has moments of almost shattering emotion (Tom Cruise talking to his dying father, Julianne Moore losing it at a pharmacy)...but also moments of almost clinical coldness, such as in the narration that opens the film.  THERE WILL BE BLOOD takes another step towards emotional distance.  Daniel Day-Lewis plays his character is a towering, unforgettable way...yet the viewer never feels they are walking in his shoes.  And THE MASTER really challenges us not to connect emotionally.  It wants us to understand the emotions of the characters, but from arms length.  We've gone from a Beckett-like way of showing the human experience to a Brecht-like detachment.  For all his brilliance, Phoenix can't make Quell a recognizable person we can empathize with...Anderson doesn't quite give us what we need about Quell to make that leap.I recommend the movie...don't get me wrong.  I was just angry at it when all was said and done, and feel each viewer should go in expecting to be challenged and confounded.  For me, the challenge seemed a bit arbitrary or capricious on Anderson's part.  Perhaps you'll feel differently.",4,"Compelling, confounding, confusing.

1544592,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B008220DGE,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 4]","In ""The Master,"" set in 1950, Joaquin Phoenix plays Freddie Quell, a World War II vet apparently suffering from alcoholism and PTSD, who comes under the influence of a mind reprogramming cult called The Cause (modeled, obviously, on Scientology). Phillip Seymour Hoffman plays the Svengali-like leader who personally befriends Freddie while casting a spell over both him and his entire flock of believers.Paul Thomas Anderson will never be a crowd-pleasing filmmaker. His movies revel in ""strange"" plots and ""weird"" characters. The themes and narrative lines are not always clear-cut or easily discernible. But for the more adventurous moviegoer, there is always much to appreciate and mull over in a PTA film. And ""The Master"" is no exception. In fact, it may be his most demanding work to date.It certainly provides a challenge to the casual moviegoer, for ""The Master"" is one of those rare films that doesn't have even a single character who could be classified as sympathetic and likable - a fact that many in the audience may find off-putting, to put it mildly. This makes the performances by Phoenix and Hoffman particularly impressive since they are called upon to make generally unappealing central characters interesting and compelling.Anderson's screenplay does its best to keep the characters deliberately opaque. Freddie is both intrigued by and strangely resistant to Lancaster Dodd's influence, quick to defend him - even to the point of physical violence if necessary - when faced with one of the leader's many detractors, but strong-willed enough to make a run for it when the opportunity presents itself. It's hard to tell whether Freddie's uncontrolled outbursts and bouts of antisocial behavior are strictly the result of the PTSD from which he's suffering or whether he is just an S.O.B. by nature and the illness is just exacerbating those tendencies.Dodd is no less inscrutable a figure. He is clearly a power-hungry charlatan, but he seems to have a genuine fondness for this deeply troubled young man who has stumbled onto his path. Yet, since we never get to see Dodd in even one genuinely unguarded moment  - never once is the public mask dropped to reveal the man within - the movie becomes the cinematic equivalent of a Rorschach's Test, with the audience free to project whatever it sees fit onto the character in terms of personality and motive. This goes for the other characters as well. Dodd's wife (Amy Adams), daughter (Ambyr Childers), son (Jesse Plemons) and son-in-law (Rami Malek) remain largely peripheral figures in the drama - which is, I suspect, a deliberate move on the part of the writer, showing how living in the shadow of The Master has left them with no identity or persona that they can truly call their own.None of this is really intended as a criticism of the film, for I'd much rather grapple with a movie whose characters are filled with ambiguity than one in which they are too easily understood and read. But it does explain why the movie isn't always easy to like and relate to. But that is what makes movie watching interesting and rewarding, after all.And on a final side note, I'd like to point out that whoever hired dead-ringer Jesse Plemons for the role of Hoffman's son should have received a special Oscar for casting. Rarely have we seen a more fit choice to portray another actor's offspring.

While the movie never mentions it, it is clear that the movement is loosely based on scientology.Like the prior films from director PTA, it is a polarizing film, you either love it or hate it. Cinematography is great and the movie was actually photographed in 65mm, the DVD holds up pretty well when upscaled in a  Sony Bluray player. The acting, especially Philip Seymour Hoffman in the role of the charismatic movement leader, is superb (though I do not understand Amy Adams' nomination as she barely has any screen time)  This is definitely PTA's darker film to date, and that is already much to say considering he is the one who gave us films like 'Magnolia', 'There will be blood' and 'Boogie nights'Would I recommend it? If you are a PTA fan this is a must, casual viewers who liked PTA's prior films may have it easier watching this, but the story and the characters are so dark that I can understand why someone would be put off by this film. My personal opinion, while I liked it, it is my least favorite film from PTA's filmography.Should you get the Bluray or the DVD? Unlike prior films in which music was a factor ('Magnolia'). That is not the case with 'The master', the DVD version contains a Dolby  Digital 5.1 track that sounds great in a well configured Home Theater. The picture quality is actually pretty good, a Bluray will definitely deliver better sound and picture quality, but in my opinion, films like this one do not benefit that much from the HD, but that's just me.What is included in the DVD? The movie is presented in 1.85:1 letterbox format, anamorphic widescreen and contains subtitles both in English (for the hearing impaired) and Spanish. Only one audio track is included, English Dolby Digital 5.1Additionally, the extras include outtakes, teaser/trailers and a short behind the scenes titled ""Unguided message"". Fans of the film should be surprised by the inclusion of a picture of Philip Seymour Hoffman's character as an extra with the DVD, which is one of the pictures Freddie Quell takes in the movie (included an image in the product description)",3,"Like the prior films from director Paul Thomas Anderson, a polarizing film...",1364342400,"03 27, 2013",2013,2453,"['6th', 'movie', 'director', 'Paul', 'Thomas', 'Anderson', 'filmography', 'Master', 'story', 'world', 'war', 'II', 'naval', 'veteran', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'who', 'leader', 'religious', 'movement', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'known', ""'the"", 'cause', 'who', 'join', 'group', 'repercussions', 'relationship', 'lives', ""'the"", 'cause', 'movie', 'never', 'mentions', 'clear', 'movement', 'loosely', 'based', 'prior', 'films', 'director', 'PTA', 'polarizing', 'film', 'either', 'love', 'hate', 'Cinematography', 'great', 'movie', 'was', 'actually', 'photographed', '65mm', 'DVD', 'up', 'pretty', 'well', 'when', 'upscaled', 'Sony', 'Bluray', 'player', 'acting', 'especially', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'role', 'charismatic', 'movement', 'leader', 'superb', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'nomination', 'barely', 'screen', 'time', 'definitely', 'PTA', 'darker', 'film', 'date', 'already', 'much', 'say', 'considering', 'one', 'who', 'gave', 'films', ""'Magnolia"", 'will', 'be', 'blood', ""nights'Would"", 'recommend', 'are', 'PTA', 'fan', 'must', 'casual', 'viewers', 'who', 'liked', 'PTA', 'prior', 'films', 'may', 'have', 'easier', 'watching', 'story', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'dark', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'someone', 'would', 'be', 'put', 'off', 'film', 'personal', 'opinion', 'liked', 'least', 'favorite', 'film', 'PTA', 'filmography.Should', 'get', 'Bluray', 'DVD', 'prior', 'films', 'music', 'was', 'factor', ""'Magnolia"", 'not', 'case', ""'The"", 'master', 'DVD', 'version', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'track', 'great', 'well', 'configured', 'Home', 'Theater', 'picture', 'quality', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'Bluray', 'will', 'definitely', 'deliver', 'better', 'sound', 'picture', 'quality', 'opinion', 'films', 'one', 'do', 'not', 'benefit', 'much', 'HD', 'just', 'me.What', 'included', 'DVD', 'movie', 'presented', '1.85:1', 'letterbox', 'format', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'subtitles', 'English', 'hearing', 'impaired', 'Spanish', 'Only', 'one', 'audio', 'track', 'included', 'English', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1Additionally', 'extras', 'include', 'outtakes', 'teaser/trailers', 'short', 'scenes', 'titled', 'Unguided', 'message', 'Fans', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'surprised', 'inclusion', 'picture', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'character', 'extra', 'DVD', 'one', 'pictures', 'Freddie', 'Quell', 'movie', 'included', 'image', 'product', 'description']",N/A

Freddy and Dodd share a brotherly bond that is quite beautiful. In the end, their lives cannot really co-exist in union: Freddy cannot be persuaded by The Cause, ultimately -- his own master is booze and loose women; and Dodd's master is clearly opposed to Freddy's ways. Freddy is freer than some; and, yet, just as bound. He's akin to Diogenes: a citizen of the world, free to roam where he wishes -- usually causing unrest. Even with such freedom, he will always succumb to his vices -- the final moments reflect this.Whatever the case may be, Freddy is a beautiful character in all of his flaws -- child-like, even. And Dodd has the open arms of a welcoming father seeing his son return. However, the movie isn't just an exploration of both of those characters.

I was definitely right about that.When I watch a very serious movie like this, I look for its soul.  I have to care about someone or something in the story.  That something was definitely missing for me with this film.  Freddy is already so damaged and so alienated at the beginning of the film.  It's impossible to like him or care about what happens to him.  As The Master, Philip Seymour Hoffman has undeniable gravitas but no allure.  Amy Adams's performance as Peggy is incredibly restrained.  All three of these actors are undeniably accomplished, but their performances are not at all appealing.It's a well made movie, no question.  The cinematography is very fine.  The post-war costumes are really great.  The department store scene near the beginning of the movie is really a feast for the eyes.  Beyond that, this movie leaves me cold.

But what people seem to like about it varies - I hear sweeping statements of the gorgeous look of the film, and rave reviews of the acting . . . but the story of a cult leader (Philip Seymour Hoffman) taking a drifter (Joaquin Phoenix) under his wing in post-WWII America never seems to really grab people.When I ask, ""Do you want to see it again,"" I get a lot of shrugs.That's ultimately how ""The Master"" left me.  Perhaps I am too middlebrow to appreciate this movie, but I think of a movie like I think of a painting.  I have some art of my walls that is not exactly high-falutin' stuff, but I love it.  I'm thinking of a highly expressionistic portrait of a jazzman honking away on a clarinet, and I love it even though it's far too amateur to ever hang in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  But then I think back to some of the paintings I've seen in famous museums and I would never have them on my walls for any price.  I can admire their craftsmanship, I suppose, but I don't want to ponder them.""The Master"" is the same.  Chock full of terrific actors doing interesting things with complex characters, ""The Master"" is a film for film students.  I read the reviews online, trying to find what I should have loved in this movie, and I generally read reviewers who are trying to use their admiration for this movie to establish their own bona fides.I like Anderson's movies. I truly appreciated ""There Will Be Blood,"" and if it hadn't been for ""No Country for Old Men"" it may have been my favoriate movie of that year.  But this exploration of powerful men trying to shape the world somehow kept me at arm's length where ""TWBB"" brought me headfirst into its universe.Long story short, if you're going to be hanging with some cinephiles and want to establish your street cred, watch this movie and take extensive notes on the IMDB details.  I'm sure your ""friends"" will be impressed.  But I'd be shocked if you, on a surprise free evening, you peruse your film collection and say, ""Hey, I haven't seen 'The Master' in two months - let's watch it again!""  If you're honest, you'll skip it and watch ""Goodfellas"" for the 15th time.",3,Perhaps if I'd seen it before the hype . . .,1369267200,"05 23, 2013",2013,2363,"['Nothing', 'worse', 'trying', 'consume', 'popular', 'culture', 'been', 'designated', 'great', ""'ve"", 'lost', 'count', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'real', 'folks', 'film', 'critics', 'who', 'have', 'raved', 'Paul', 'Thomas', 'Anderson', 'Master', 'what', 'people', 'seem', 'like', 'hear', 'sweeping', 'statements', 'gorgeous', 'look', 'film', 'rave', 'reviews', 'acting', 'story', 'cult', 'leader', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'taking', 'drifter', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'wing', 'post-WWII', 'America', 'never', 'really', 'grab', 'people.When', 'ask', 'Do', 'want', 'see', 'again', 'get', 'lot', 'shrugs.That', 'ultimately', 'how', 'Master', 'left', 'Perhaps', 'am', 'too', 'middlebrow', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'think', 'movie', 'think', 'painting', 'have', 'art', 'walls', 'not', 'exactly', 'high-falutin', 'stuff', 'love', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'highly', 'expressionistic', 'portrait', 'jazzman', 'honking', 'away', 'clarinet', 'love', 'even', 'far', 'too', 'amateur', 'ever', 'hang', 'Metropolitan', 'Museum', 'Art', 'then', 'think', 'back', 'paintings', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'famous', 'museums', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'walls', 'price', 'can', 'admire', 'craftsmanship', 'suppose', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'ponder', 'Master', 'same', 'Chock', 'full', 'terrific', 'actors', 'doing', 'interesting', 'things', 'complex', 'characters', 'Master', 'film', 'film', 'students', 'read', 'reviews', 'online', 'trying', 'find', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'loved', 'movie', 'generally', 'read', 'reviewers', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'use', 'admiration', 'movie', 'establish', 'own', 'bona', 'fides.I', 'Anderson', 'movies', 'truly', 'appreciated', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'No', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'favoriate', 'movie', 'year', 'exploration', 'powerful', 'men', 'trying', 'shape', 'world', 'somehow', 'kept', 'arm', 'length', 'where', 'TWBB', 'brought', 'universe.Long', 'story', 'short', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'hanging', 'cinephiles', 'want', 'establish', 'street', 'cred', 'watch', 'movie', 'take', 'extensive', 'notes', 'IMDB', 'details', ""'m"", 'sure', 'friends', 'will', 'be', 'impressed', ""'d"", 'be', 'shocked', 'surprise', 'free', 'evening', 'peruse', 'film', 'collection', 'say', 'Hey', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', ""'The"", 'Master', 'two', 'months', 'let', 'watch', 'again', ""'re"", 'honest', ""'ll"", 'skip', 'watch', 'Goodfellas', '15th', 'time']",N/A
1544611,A1OUL0D9AGHPDY,B008220DGE,S. Craig Zahler,"[1, 4]","The core problems of this piece are problems of most Paul Thomas Anderson work. It works sometimes as allegory and cinematic diorama, but infrequently as drama. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is neither beguiling nor charismatic, the way this role requires. (Compare the various Hoffman speeches to any scene with John Hawkes in the far, far, far superior cult picture, Martha Marcy May Marlene.) From the beginning, we see Hoffman as quick to anger and a cold manipulator and there is no element of seduction in terms of bringing Joaquin Phoenix, and the audience, into the cult. Joaquin is neither charismatic nor very interesting, unless you find a mediocre love interest and drinking interesting.Both actors overdo it and get quite theatrical, though nothing like the abhorrent mugging and apoplectic histrionics of Daniel Day Lewis in There Will Be Blood. Maximum acting and method actor anger (the jail scene and singing bits are quite forced). I can engage in a movie with unlikable characters that are interesting, but these characters are neither and the actors do not bring enough personality to the roles to overcome the limitations of the script. Their relationship does not really work, and it's supposed to be a pillar of the movie--- see the failed melodrama at the end.Like the excellent opening sequences of There Will Be Blood and the Tom Cruise stuff in Magnolia, The Master has about 20+ minutes of material that is truly noteworthy--- the processing sequences. The drama and intensity of these scenes crackle vibrantly in comparison to the other sort of engaging two hours, which plays out like a vague biopic sans pathos. With the exception of the processing scenes and the overwrought acting, the overall piece is mild and less interesting than its subject.",2,"Yet another ambitious, mostly mediocre, occasionally excellent Paul Thomas Anderson picture",1382832000,"10 27, 2013",2013,1773,"['core', 'problems', 'piece', 'are', 'problems', 'most', 'Paul', 'Thomas', 'Anderson', 'work', 'sometimes', 'allegory', 'cinematic', 'diorama', 'infrequently', 'drama', 'Phillip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'beguiling', 'charismatic', 'way', 'role', 'Compare', 'various', 'Hoffman', 'speeches', 'scene', 'John', 'Hawkes', 'far', 'far', 'far', 'superior', 'cult', 'picture', 'Martha', 'Marcy', 'May', 'Marlene', 'beginning', 'see', 'Hoffman', 'quick', 'anger', 'cold', 'manipulator', 'element', 'seduction', 'terms', 'bringing', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'audience', 'cult', 'Joaquin', 'charismatic', 'very', 'interesting', 'find', 'mediocre', 'love', 'interest', 'drinking', 'interesting.Both', 'actors', 'overdo', 'get', 'quite', 'theatrical', 'nothing', 'abhorrent', 'mugging', 'apoplectic', 'histrionics', 'Daniel', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'Maximum', 'acting', 'method', 'actor', 'anger', 'jail', 'scene', 'singing', 'bits', 'are', 'quite', 'forced', 'can', 'engage', 'movie', 'unlikable', 'characters', 'are', 'interesting', 'characters', 'are', 'actors', 'do', 'not', 'bring', 'enough', 'personality', 'roles', 'overcome', 'limitations', 'script', 'relationship', 'not', 'really', 'work', 'supposed', 'be', 'pillar', 'movie', 'see', 'failed', 'melodrama', 'end.Like', 'excellent', 'opening', 'sequences', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'stuff', 'Magnolia', 'Master', 'about', '20+', 'minutes', 'material', 'truly', 'noteworthy', 'processing', 'sequences', 'drama', 'intensity', 'scenes', 'crackle', 'vibrantly', 'comparison', 'other', 'sort', 'engaging', 'two', 'hours', 'out', 'vague', 'biopic', 'sans', 'pathos', 'exception', 'processing', 'scenes', 'overwrought', 'acting', 'overall', 'piece', 'mild', 'less', 'interesting', 'subject']",N/A
1544612,A1WFEHAV42HTM5,B008220DGE,Scrimshaw,"[0, 8]","Paul Thomas Anderson is quite possibly one of the most overrated directors working today in Hollywood, sure he gets a lot of credit due to creating mostly mainstream drama films that they love to give awards to at the Oscars, but other than that, he isn't particularly innovative or talented when it comes to making films. His movies are filled with miserable, depressed, unhappy, people who are often searching for happiness or meaning in their lives, and his newest historical drama, The Master, is no exception. The Master follows a tortured soul named Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix), who despite being a supposed war veteran, actually looks more like a stroke victim, as he has an odd habit of talking out of one side of his mouth, and slurring his words, regardless of whether or not he's drunk. At the beginning and first half hour or so of the film he spends wandering aimlessly around the town or city in California where he lives, taking photographs of people, or harassing them and having sex with loose women. One night while intoxicated he finds his way on to a yacht owned by Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a local leader of a philosophical movement called ""The Cause"" which seems a lot like the infamous celebrity religion Scientology, as has been noted by other reviewers. After attending the wedding of Dodd's daughter he undergoes ""processing"" to uncover past trauma, and afterwards becomes somewhat of Dodd's right hand man, attacking or intimidating those who disagree with the beliefs and methods of The Cause. One man in the film notes how the group seems an awful lot like a cult, as Dodd often gets very defensive and angry when his beliefs or motives are questioned by others. He seems outwardly calm and composed but whenever he is questioned about his sincerity and truthfulness he becomes a raging storm almost as crazy as Quell. I guess the message of this film is the idea, which has been done to death, by the way, that religion is no more than a cult that requires blind obedience, brainwashing, and deception and that the founders of religions are in fact crazed cult leaders who only truly desire servants or slaves who will obey them, hence the films's title The Master. The acting was pretty good all around, I will admit, there was a certain intensity in many scenes, and the cinematography was also quite good, there were many beautiful shots of beaches, neighborhoods, and a desert, but that wasn't nearly enough. Quell's character wasn't very likable, but he was sympathetic, and most of the other characters such as Peggy (Amy Adams) and Elizabeth (Ambyr Childers), with the exception of Dodd, were also sympathetic, but it takes more than dozens of miserable, brainwashed characters you can sympathize with to make a good film. I understand that religions and people like Dodd and Quell do exist in real life and it is in fact very tragic what happens to many of these people but overall many of the themes and messages this films has are pretty obvious and well known, many religious people are in fact angry and miserable, but it's not like it's any big revelation. Any person who knows enough about organized religions such as Islam and Mormonism, knows that people like this exist and are attracted to belief systems like this. The fact that Anderson thought it was a good plot for a feature film often seems as though he believes most people are unaware or too stupid to realize this, and in effect it almost feels as though he is underestimating or insulting our intelligence. That definitely takes alot away from the quality of the film. Also, one last thing. Much of the dialogue and content of the film seemed out of place for it being the post world war 2 era. There are many unnecessary sex scenes, nudity, and crude dialogue scattered throughout, not to mention very strong, crude language, isn't this supposed to be the ""good old days"" when people were more decent and civilized, yet these characters, aside from the clothes and technology, seem like the kind of people you might meet in any given town in America nowadays in the 21st century!

Freddie Quell (Phoenix) is an able-bodied seaman who has trouble adapting to life after the war. He may have been mentally disturbed before that, but we aren't shown enough of his background to make that determination.We are shown something of Quell's attempts to hold down a regular job -- he seems to have a gift for photography -- but he's quick to anger and attacks one of his customers without apparent provocation. He's also an alcoholic, and we see him drinking all manner of questionable substances, some of which appear to be potentially lethal. When he's accused of poisoning someone with one of his concoctions, he seeks refuge on a ship.This is where the film gives the audience a glimmer of hope that it will develop into something interesting. This ship is run by Lancaster Dodd (Hoffman), who claims to be a writer, doctor, nuclear physicist, theoretical philosopher, and a great many more things. Dodd is fascinated by human beings and psychology, and wants to understand Quell and help him with his obvious anger issues. Dodd has his own way of doing things and his psychoanalysis produces the most memorable scenes in the movie.Dodd is married to Peggy (Adams), but she's just as unpleasant as the rest of the characters. She barely had any lines, and most of the ones she did have were obscene.Quell frequently fantasizes about women, as outlined in an early masturbation scene on the beach with a girl fashioned out of sand. This theme is continued when he pictures women naked at a gathering.If this were a story about Dodd's quest to heal Quell, I might be satisfied with it, but the plot meanders along without any obvious conclusion.I consider myself a patient viewer, and I appreciate all manner of films that have slow plots, hidden messages, and flawed characters. Unfortunately, The Master left me disappointed.The final 30 minutes were thought-provoking. I found myself thinking whether I should walk out, and whether anyone would mind if I were to take off my right shoe and scratch my foot. I also wondered whether time was moving differently all of a sudden, and if this was the same Paul Thomas Anderson who gave is There Will Be Blood and Magnolia.The individual components of the film were mostly in place; the acting was fine, the cinematography and score worked, and Anderson presented a convincing picture of New York in the 1950s. What wasn't present was a coherent story or a reason to care about these miserable characters.I doubt that Amy Adams will ever work for Disney again after some of the words that came out of her mouth.",2,Didn't work for me,1350086400,"10 13, 2012",2012,2994,"['once', 'while', 'film', 'created', 'visionary', 'director', 'top', 'game', 'memorable', 'performances', 'best', 'actors', 'working', 'today', 'resulting', 'cohesive', 'moving', 'powerful', 'story', 'fully', 'me.This', 'not', 'one', 'times.The', 'Master', 'populated', 'unlikable', 'characters', 'who', 'do', 'nothing', 'redeem', 'point', 'film.The', 'bulk', 'story', 'place', '1950', 'Freddie', 'Quell', 'Phoenix', 'able-bodied', 'seaman', 'who', 'trouble', 'adapting', 'life', 'war', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'mentally', 'disturbed', 'are', ""n't"", 'shown', 'enough', 'background', 'make', 'determination.We', 'are', 'shown', 'something', 'Quell', 'attempts', 'hold', 'down', 'regular', 'job', 'have', 'gift', 'photography', 'quick', 'anger', 'attacks', 'one', 'customers', 'apparent', 'provocation', 'also', 'alcoholic', 'see', 'drinking', 'manner', 'questionable', 'substances', 'appear', 'be', 'potentially', 'lethal', 'When', 'accused', 'poisoning', 'someone', 'one', 'concoctions', 'refuge', 'ship.This', 'where', 'film', 'audience', 'glimmer', 'hope', 'will', 'develop', 'something', 'interesting', 'ship', 'run', 'Lancaster', 'Dodd', 'Hoffman', 'who', 'be', 'writer', 'doctor', 'nuclear', 'physicist', 'theoretical', 'philosopher', 'great', 'many', 'more', 'things', 'Dodd', 'fascinated', 'human', 'beings', 'psychology', 'understand', 'Quell', 'help', 'obvious', 'anger', 'issues', 'Dodd', 'own', 'way', 'doing', 'things', 'psychoanalysis', 'most', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'movie.Dodd', 'married', 'Peggy', 'Adams', 'just', 'as', 'unpleasant', 'rest', 'characters', 'barely', 'had', 'lines', 'most', 'ones', 'did', 'have', 'were', 'obscene.Quell', 'frequently', 'women', 'outlined', 'early', 'masturbation', 'scene', 'beach', 'girl', 'fashioned', 'sand', 'theme', 'continued', 'when', 'women', 'naked', 'gathering.If', 'were', 'story', 'Dodd', 'quest', 'heal', 'Quell', 'might', 'be', 'satisfied', 'plot', 'meanders', 'obvious', 'conclusion.I', 'consider', 'patient', 'viewer', 'appreciate', 'manner', 'films', 'have', 'slow', 'plots', 'hidden', 'messages', 'flawed', 'characters', 'Unfortunately', 'Master', 'left', 'disappointed.The', 'final', '30', 'minutes', 'were', 'thought-provoking', 'found', 'thinking', 'should', 'walk', 'out', 'anyone', 'would', 'mind', 'were', 'take', 'off', 'right', 'shoe', 'scratch', 'foot', 'also', 'wondered', 'time', 'was', 'moving', 'differently', 'sudden', 'was', 'same', 'Paul', 'Thomas', 'Anderson', 'who', 'gave', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'Magnolia.The', 'individual', 'components', 'film', 'were', 'mostly', 'place', 'acting', 'was', 'fine', 'cinematography', 'score', 'worked', 'Anderson', 'presented', 'convincing', 'picture', 'New', 'York', '1950s', 'What', 'was', ""n't"", 'present', 'was', 'coherent', 'story', 'reason', 'care', 'miserable', 'characters.I', 'doubt', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'will', 'ever', 'work', 'Disney', 'again', 'words', 'came', 'mouth']",N/A

We get clarity and detail of a post-war America and the 50s with brilliant production design in clothes,department stores,music, cars, ships.Joaquin Phoenix plays Freddie Quell,a man with PTSD/alcoholism,drifting aimlessly and at odds with a family-friendly reality.He mixes up hooch from torpedo oil or paint thinner.He stows away on the boat (that happens to belong to Lancaster Dodd,The Master) that brings him into The Cause.Phoenix's acting is frenetic, twitchy,driven like Montgomery Clift out of Neil Cassidy.He is obsessed with sex and sees it everywhere.Dodd(Hoffman) is inspired by LRon Hubbard of Scientology fame,with a dash of Wellesian conman charm.He brings Freddie through processing sessions which are very well done with flash backs to Freddie's own Rosebud moments and buried traumas to excavate the past lives.Dodd is a patriarchal bon vivant with room in an extended family for Quell.One can't understand how these two men are drawn together,but when both are thrown in adjoining cells(for Dodds practising medicine without a license) they squabble like lovers.Dodds also is partial to Freddie's alcoholic mixtures and takes him on as a fighter in The Cause and as a photographer.Dodd while fund-raising in the Dowager set shows himself to be a song-and-dance man,razzle-dazzling his way through a roomful of pliant females,like a satyr in a visualization of naked women,from Freddie's or his wife Peggie's(Adams)POV.Peggy masturbating Dodd shows her proprietary claims to her `roving' partner.Dodd doesn't take too kindly to being questioned about his beliefs,losing his temper with a hostile interlocutor at a cocktail party in New York,or when questioned about the change of a simple word from `recall' to `imagine' by a gushing sponsor,Helen Sullivan(Dern).His large appetite for life has its limits.Phoenix gives an extraordinary,twisted,contorted,Method-like,performance, Hoffman is charismatic,beguiling.The edgy,propulsive score byJohnny Greenwood is effective.Beneath these two riveting performances there is a lack of substance to the film as if it retreated from subversion and pared back its ambitions.We are moved away from the cult's serious operations and corrupting forces,towards its central figures as characters not strictly defined by it.Quell's disinterest in the religion he embraces is the film's own detachment from it.We are all at sea like our surrogate, who(not Dodds) is at the centre of the drama.There is no content of belief only rhetoric, Dodd's has the power not the sermon, manipulating like all cult leaders, for whom we have no backstory.The film remains impenetrable,the characters's motivations remain vague even while richly endowed and believable,what really draws them together(friendship or suppressed romance,who knows?).The psychological robustness of the characters is not integrated into the operational substance of the cult,using one to dig into the other. These lead to moments when the film is treading the water of inaction and repetition, and the ending is like the air has been let out of a big galleon balloon riding over the landscape.Hollywood it seems remains kind to Scientology.",3,Missed chance or slow boat to China?,1364083200,"03 24, 2013",2013,3480,"['Anderson', 'big', 'subjects', 'only', 'Scorsese', 'taken', 'similar', 'big', 'subject', 'more', 'biography', 'Howard', 'Hughes', 'Aviator.He', 'often', 'father-son', 'relationship', 'Boogie', 'Nights', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'Hard', 'Eight', '.The', 'Master', 'been', 'shot', '65mm', 'film', 'epic', 'technique', 'what', 'chamber', 'piece', 'get', 'clarity', 'detail', 'post-war', 'America', '50s', 'brilliant', 'production', 'design', 'clothes', 'department', 'stores', 'music', 'cars', 'ships.Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Freddie', 'Quell', 'man', 'PTSD/alcoholism', 'drifting', 'aimlessly', 'odds', 'family-friendly', 'reality.He', 'mixes', 'up', 'hooch', 'torpedo', 'oil', 'paint', 'thinner.He', 'away', 'boat', 'belong', 'Lancaster', 'Dodd', 'Master', 'Cause.Phoenix', 'acting', 'frenetic', 'twitchy', 'driven', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'Neil', 'Cassidy.He', 'obsessed', 'sex', 'everywhere.Dodd', 'Hoffman', 'inspired', 'LRon', 'Hubbard', 'Scientology', 'fame', 'dash', 'Wellesian', 'conman', 'charm.He', 'Freddie', 'processing', 'sessions', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'flash', 'backs', 'Freddie', 'own', 'Rosebud', 'moments', 'buried', 'traumas', 'excavate', 'past', 'lives.Dodd', 'patriarchal', 'bon', 'vivant', 'room', 'extended', 'family', 'Quell.One', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', 'two', 'men', 'are', 'drawn', 'together', 'when', 'are', 'thrown', 'adjoining', 'cells', 'Dodds', 'practising', 'medicine', 'license', 'squabble', 'lovers.Dodds', 'also', 'partial', 'Freddie', 'alcoholic', 'mixtures', 'fighter', 'Cause', 'photographer.Dodd', 'fund-raising', 'Dowager', 'set', 'be', 'song-and-dance', 'man', 'razzle-dazzling', 'way', 'roomful', 'pliant', 'females', 'satyr', 'visualization', 'naked', 'women', 'Freddie', 'wife', 'Peggie', 'Adams', 'POV.Peggy', 'masturbating', 'Dodd', 'proprietary', 'claims', 'roving', 'partner.Dodd', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'kindly', 'being', 'questioned', 'beliefs', 'losing', 'temper', 'hostile', 'interlocutor', 'cocktail', 'party', 'New', 'York', 'when', 'questioned', 'change', 'simple', 'word', 'recall', 'imagine', 'gushing', 'sponsor', 'Helen', 'Sullivan', 'Dern', '.His', 'large', 'appetite', 'life', 'limits.Phoenix', 'extraordinary', 'twisted', 'contorted', 'Method-like', 'performance', 'Hoffman', 'charismatic', 'beguiling.The', 'edgy', 'propulsive', 'score', 'byJohnny', 'Greenwood', 'effective.Beneath', 'two', 'riveting', 'performances', 'lack', 'substance', 'film', 'retreated', 'subversion', 'pared', 'back', 'ambitions.We', 'are', 'moved', 'away', 'cult', 'serious', 'operations', 'corrupting', 'forces', 'towards', 'central', 'figures', 'characters', 'not', 'strictly', 'defined', 'it.Quell', 'disinterest', 'religion', 'film', 'own', 'detachment', 'it.We', 'are', 'sea', 'surrogate', 'who', 'not', 'Dodds', 'centre', 'drama.There', 'content', 'belief', 'only', 'rhetoric', 'Dodd', 'power', 'not', 'sermon', 'manipulating', 'cult', 'leaders', 'whom', 'have', 'backstory.The', 'film', 'impenetrable', 'characters', 'motivations', 'remain', 'vague', 'even', 'richly', 'endowed', 'believable', 'what', 'really', 'together', 'friendship', 'suppressed', 'romance', 'who', 'psychological', 'robustness', 'characters', 'not', 'integrated', 'operational', 'substance', 'cult', 'using', 'one', 'dig', 'other', 'lead', 'moments', 'when', 'film', 'treading', 'water', 'inaction', 'repetition', 'ending', 'air', 'been', 'let', 'big', 'galleon', 'balloon', 'riding', 'landscape.Hollywood', 'kind', 'Scientology']",N/A

Philip Seymour Hoffman as the Master with his arrogance, pretentiousness, and odd charisma seems to correlate well with the LRH that existed in real life. He even dresses and looks a bit like him.So to me, the subject matter was really interesting. The problem is, the movie went nowhere. The acting was excellent, yet the characters never grew or changed in any way. The Master was a static character who never changed. His wife started crazy and ended crazy.And Joaquin Phoenix as Freddie, the guy the movie is really about, goes nowhere. Unless you count going from crazy to crazier. There is no character arc in this movie. No one grows or changes in any way that we care about.Worst of all, the movie has no ending. It just stops. I prefer movies that actually have an ending. Even if I don't like the conclusion, I still prefer movies that have one. But this one has no ending or conclusion. The film just stops running, leaving you wondering, ""What did I just watch? And why did I watch it?""The big reveal at the end of the movie proved to be false and hollow, intentionally so. I could accept this, if it made for some heartfelt change in our main character. But it changed nothing in him, so it was ultimately meaningless.This movie was well-crafted, but it made me feel empty and hollow. Unfortunately, this movie is a good allegory for Scientology itself.

He believes Freddie's familiar face must be from one of them.Dodd is a cult leader of a movement called ""The Cause"" which gets it name from the fact that if they used ""Scientology"" they would get sued. The fact that Hollywood would make what is unmistakably an anti-Scientology film is remarkable in itself.Freddie is a wild cannon who threatens to derail the movement with his violent tendencies and lust. The Master sees him as a work in progress, one that he must conquer in order to justify his ideas to himself. His family doesn't see it that way.

It is not surprising; the film is awkward to say the least. For my part I loved it but I am not going to try to convince anyone about its merits. Several reviews here manage to do that; while several others point out its difficulties or shortcomings. I want to make a point about this unevenness / awkwardness.According to me this suits perfectly its subject matter: the need to belong to groups, religious, political or whatever and, associated with that, the cult of the messiah or savior (the master). Groups of any description can cross a point when they become more than a club and require from the members further commitment. This commitment can reach the point of &#34;faith&#34; and have profound positive or/and negative impacts on people and societies. It can be really fulfilling, enjoyable, exhilarating, but when it crosses a point it can become dangerous, destructive and fatal. The major problem is that it is not easy to pinpoint where the dividing line between the two aspects is; or perhaps there is no dividing line; the groups can be positive and negative at the same time.

1544637,ALJLONJXLA3OQ,B008220DGE,The People's Critic,"[3, 5]","Two things can be said with certainty about Paul Thomas Anderson's latest film, The Master. First, Anderson definitely knows his way around a camera; second, Joaquin Phoenix emphatically knows his way around appearing `disturbed.' Both of these elements are used to their absolute potential in order to challenge and entice the audience to look a little closer at this film than, perhaps, Anderson has asked in the past.The Master is Anderson's sixth stop on his cinematic journey through American culture and it may be his most polarizing one to date. Director, Anderson has mesmerized audiences with triumphantly engaging dissections of American culture in films like Boogie Nights, Magnolia, and of course 2007&#8242;s There Will Be Blood. The Master returns Anderson to his role as writer along with being director after his singular exception, adapting Upton Sinclair's Oil! into There Will Be Blood. This time Anderson takes an isolated and cold look at specific segment of post-World War II 1950s America. Phoenix plays Freddie Quell, a Naval veteran who struggles with alcoholism, anger issues, and repressed memories of a troubled upbringing which partially manifest in unhealthy sexual obsessions. After the war, Quell finds himself in a series of odd-jobs that he is in no way suited for, including one that results in his being chased off after one of his ""home-made"" alcoholic concoctions seemingly brings about the death, or near death, of one of his co-workers. It is here that Quell finds himself a stow-away on a yacht commanded by a charming, yet nefarious character by the name of Lancaster Dodd, played by Philip Seymour Hoffman (who stars in four of Anderson's six films). Dodd is at sea to officiate and celebrate the wedding of his daughter, but upon the discovery of Quell his interests turn to him and his story. Dodd's compassion for Quell unveils to reveal his role as leader of a cultest group known as The Cause. Dodd uses his wit, intellect, and charm to pray on the affluent, which in turn results in additional wealth, appreciation, and power for him and his group. He is quick to accept compliments, but resorts to shouting down and conceivably condoning violence against his critics. Quell, who has been wrestling with his uncertain future, is easily drawn in by their hypnotizing appeal.What follows is a slow-burn of a drama that gains all of its leisurely paced momentum from the conflicts that arise between Quell and Dodd. It is also a challenging film for the viewer. It is a cinematic puzzle on par with enigmatic films like Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life in 2011. We are forced to pay close attention as we constantly question a look, a question, or an action in an ongoing battle to understand these characters' true motivations. A follow-up to There Will Be Blood, it is hard to ignore the similarities between Blood's Daniel Plainview and Master's Lancaster Dodd; the names are iconically memorable for starters. Furthermore, Dodd's methodical and meticulous effort to distort and corrupt the psyche of Quell in order to vindicate or authenticate himself certainly rings a bell.The Master is not an easy film to understand, nor is it an easy film to watch given its 140 minute running time. What it is, is a beautifully acted and orchestrated character analysis filmed on 65 mm film stock. Anderson takes endless risks here and while the film drags, his criticisms on some of the supposed motivations of those who promise answers, faith, or comfort do stay with you after the credits role.

1544638,A3NKKLHHSS1GNO,B008220DGE,ThirtyMinuteReviews,"[3, 6]","It is difficult to know what to take from The Master (2012).  There are very good, maybe even great, performances by Philip Seymour Hoffman and Joaquin Phoenix.  But, the way the performances are combined in story is underwhelming.  While it has the look and feel of a potentially memorable film, it is a disappointment.Joaquin Phoenix plays Freddie Quell, a truly lost soul.  You'll remember his name after the first half hour of the movie because Phillip Seymour Hoffman's character makes him repeat his name a half-dozen times.  Hoffman is The Master, Lancaster Dodd.  (You don't learn his name until an hour and a half into the film, I think.)  Quell and Dodd form an odd, dependent friendship.Quell is an alcoholic, the son of an insane mother and drunkard father.  He has personality issues, to say the least.  Not that he doesn't have talent--a talent for concocting strong, vile booze from whatever paint thinner or rubbing alcohol he can get his hands on.  He also has a mean streak that really shows Phoenix's acting chops.  A scene in which Quell and Dodd are locked in the county jail probably wins Phoenix Best Actor for his violent, unhinged tirade.  By the end of the film I actually felt bad for Phoenix, who must have developed serious back and neck pain from playing a character that is habitually lurching slightly forward, back hunched, arms on his hips, elbows out.  That's Quell's physical signature--creepy miscreant, outcast, loner.  To top it off, it is never clear whether he has a legitimate psychological problem that makes his anti-social outbursts beyond his control.  It makes Quell's journey difficult to relate to, and the film's circling-back-on-itself conclusion a headscratcher.  We never know if Quell is better off after the events we witnessed.Dodd is the leader of a cult.  Hoffman does a stellar job playing a big cheese that revels in being the pious, pompous mystic that the film never truly destroys.  In other words, we don't get to peek under the hood and see whether Dodd has lingering self-doubt, or even whether he has many skeletons in his closet.  Amy Adams plays his supportive and steely-eyed wife, but she is so underutilized as a character that we don't learn much about Dodd through her, either.Dodd builds a Scientology-like organization called The Cause that engages in ""processing"" of adherents to work through problems from past lives.  The scene in which Dodd processes Quell is the bread and butter of this picture.  Quell breaks down emotionally through a series of well-executed flashbacks; Dodd presses him with a litany of patient, devastating, well-rehearsed inquiries.  This is two skilled actors milking a challenging, lengthy, intense scene for all its worth.  The payoff is real and helps to get the audience grounded.  However, the scene also builds expectations that Quell's paranoia and unhappiness will be resolved, either for good or for bad.  We never find out.This film is long (2 1/2 hours), but the last half hour seemed thrown together, leaving gaping plot holes and, frankly, it had me wishing that there was another hour to fill them in to create a message or moral.  The reunion in the last key scene harkens back to There Will Be Blood's ""I drink your milkshake!"" scene, but with a bizarre suggestion of a homosexual relationship between Dodd and Quell that is only hinted-at thinly earlier in the film.  Is Dodd gay?  Is Quell?  If either is gay, does it explain everything?  Um, no.When we leave Quell, he appears to have learned little from The Master.  The Master certainly learned little form Quell.  And we learn little from this movie, perhaps other than that two impressive performances don't add up to greatness when the story bringing them together lacks a hook.  This movie will not appeal to 75% of those that watch it.",3,"Masterful performances, amateur plot",1361491200,"02 22, 2013",2013,3816,"['difficult', 'know', 'what', 'take', 'Master', '2012', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'maybe', 'even', 'great', 'performances', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'way', 'performances', 'are', 'combined', 'story', 'underwhelming', 'look', 'feel', 'potentially', 'memorable', 'film', 'disappointment.Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'Freddie', 'Quell', 'truly', 'lost', 'soul', ""'ll"", 'remember', 'name', 'first', 'hour', 'movie', 'Phillip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'character', 'repeat', 'name', 'half-dozen', 'times', 'Hoffman', 'Master', 'Lancaster', 'Dodd', 'do', ""n't"", 'learn', 'name', 'hour', 'half', 'film', 'think', 'Quell', 'Dodd', 'form', 'odd', 'dependent', 'friendship.Quell', 'alcoholic', 'son', 'insane', 'mother', 'drunkard', 'father', 'personality', 'issues', 'say', 'least', 'Not', ""n't"", 'have', 'talent', 'talent', 'concocting', 'strong', 'vile', 'booze', 'paint', 'thinner', 'rubbing', 'can', 'get', 'hands', 'also', 'mean', 'streak', 'really', 'Phoenix', 'acting', 'chops', 'scene', 'Quell', 'Dodd', 'are', 'locked', 'county', 'jail', 'probably', 'Phoenix', 'Best', 'Actor', 'violent', 'unhinged', 'tirade', 'end', 'film', 'actually', 'felt', 'bad', 'Phoenix', 'who', 'must', 'have', 'developed', 'serious', 'back', 'neck', 'pain', 'playing', 'character', 'habitually', 'lurching', 'slightly', 'forward', 'back', 'hunched', 'arms', 'hips', 'out', 'Quell', 'physical', 'signature', 'creepy', 'miscreant', 'outcast', 'loner', 'top', 'off', 'never', 'clear', 'legitimate', 'psychological', 'problem', 'anti-social', 'outbursts', 'control', 'Quell', 'journey', 'difficult', 'relate', 'film', 'circling-back-on-itself', 'conclusion', 'headscratcher', 'never', 'know', 'Quell', 'better', 'off', 'events', 'witnessed.Dodd', 'leader', 'cult', 'Hoffman', 'stellar', 'job', 'playing', 'big', 'cheese', 'being', 'pious', 'pompous', 'mystic', 'film', 'never', 'truly', 'destroys', 'other', 'words', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'peek', 'hood', 'see', 'Dodd', 'lingering', 'self-doubt', 'even', 'many', 'skeletons', 'closet', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'supportive', 'steely-eyed', 'wife', 'so', 'underutilized', 'character', 'do', ""n't"", 'learn', 'much', 'Dodd', 'either.Dodd', 'Scientology-like', 'organization', 'called', 'Cause', 'processing', 'adherents', 'work', 'problems', 'past', 'lives', 'scene', 'Dodd', 'Quell', 'bread', 'butter', 'picture', 'Quell', 'down', 'emotionally', 'series', 'well-executed', 'flashbacks', 'Dodd', 'litany', 'patient', 'devastating', 'well-rehearsed', 'inquiries', 'two', 'skilled', 'actors', 'milking', 'challenging', 'lengthy', 'intense', 'scene', 'worth', 'payoff', 'real', 'get', 'audience', 'grounded', 'However', 'scene', 'also', 'expectations', 'Quell', 'paranoia', 'unhappiness', 'will', 'be', 'resolved', 'either', 'good', 'bad', 'never', 'find', 'out.This', 'film', 'long', '2', '1/2', 'hours', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'seemed', 'thrown', 'together', 'leaving', 'gaping', 'plot', 'holes', 'frankly', 'had', 'wishing', 'was', 'hour', 'fill', 'create', 'message', 'moral', 'reunion', 'last', 'key', 'scene', 'back', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'drink', 'milkshake', 'scene', 'bizarre', 'suggestion', 'homosexual', 'relationship', 'Dodd', 'Quell', 'only', 'hinted-at', 'thinly', 'earlier', 'film', 'Dodd', 'gay', 'Quell', 'gay', 'explain', 'everything', 'Um', 'leave', 'Quell', 'have', 'learned', 'little', 'Master', 'Master', 'certainly', 'learned', 'little', 'form', 'Quell', 'learn', 'little', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'other', 'two', 'impressive', 'performances', 'do', ""n't"", 'add', 'up', 'greatness', 'when', 'story', 'bringing', 'together', 'hook', 'movie', 'will', 'not', 'appeal', '75', '%', 'watch']",N/A

But Quell is literally and figuratively hitting his head against the wall.And this is a good analogy for how I felt after watching Paul Thomas Anderson's new film ""The Master"". I felt like I was hitting my head against the wall.I am a huge admirer of Anderson's films. ""Magnolia"" and ""There Will Be Blood"" are two of my favorite films. ""Punch Drunk Love"" remains the best and only watchable Adam Sandler film. ""Boogie Nights"" is a great film containing some of the best performances of many of the actor's careers.I also admire his films because he is one of a small handful of directors who make films they want to make in the way they want to make them. A three hour-plus look at the intersecting lives of people in the San Fernando Valley? Most studios would laugh in the director's face and slam the door behind them. A film about a turn-of-the-century oil prospector and the first section of the film will have no dialogue? Get out of here. Anderson is one of the few directors who can pull this off. He has only made six films in sixteen years and he tells complex, interesting and unusual stories in exactly the way he envisions.Anderson is one of a handful of directors who seem to have complete control over their films. The film opened a week early in two theaters in Los Angeles and a few theaters in New York. Because he shot the film in 70mm, he requested the film be shown in 70mm and 35mm in addition to the now prevalent Digital Projection. The theaters agreed because they know he goes to such great pains to compose his films, and that their clientele would probably want to see the film in 70mm. But really, how often do you hear of a director doing this? More important, how many studios and theaters would agree to the extra cost? When the film eventually rolls out to theaters across the country, it will inevitably play in shoebox theaters, but it is an indication of the passion of the director that he is willing and able to make such a request. It is a sign of the respect he has earned that such a request is honored.Because he makes each film with such care, and makes so few films, each new story arrives with a lot of anticipation attached. Buzz has been circulating about his newest film ""The Master"" almost from the moment it was announced. ""It is a biography of L. Ron Hubbard, the former science fiction pulp writer who founded Scientology, the home to Tom Cruise, John Travolta, Kirstie Alley and many other Hollywood stars."" ""It is a critique of Scientology, looking at the early days of the movement."" ""It isn't a critique of Scientology."" ""It has nothing to do with Scientology."" ""It isn't about L. Ron Hubbard."" And so on.All of these arguments and comments evaporated when Anderson screened the film for Cruise, to get his input and/ or approval. The film does seem like a pretty transparent look at L. Ron Hubbard and the early days of Scientology.But ""The Master"" does not reach the same heights as his previous films. And that's a shame, because it has a lot of good things going for it.The production design, the sound design, the performances of the two leads, all great.I would call Anderson an artist, despite this small misstep. He crafts every frame of his films with such exacting detail that you can't help but be transported to the time and place depicted. ""Master"" opens with a brief segment depicting Freddie's service in the Navy during the last days of World War II. The scenes show the men trying to stave off boredom and getting into mischief. And they give us a glimpse at the lengths Freddy will go to get buzzed on alcohol. These moments, influenced by Terrence Malick's ""The Thin Red Line"", are strangely beautiful in their depiction of the war; they almost seem like they could be pulled from a hyper-realistic revival of ""South Pacific"". When the story returns stateside, Freddy gets a job at a department store and you have no doubt the film is set in the 50s. Anderson recreates a grand old store (like an old Bullocks) with such beauty, it makes you feel as though you are actually walking through it. A beautiful yacht, a Manhattan socialite's apartment, a large home, a seedy storefront in Phoenix, each new setting adds to the rich look of the film.Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood composed the music for this film, as he did with ""There Will Be Blood"", and it is an unusual score adding a lot of the texture to the film. As Freddie tries to stave off boredom in the Navy, he pounds on a coconut, trying to get it open. These sounds join other bits of ambient noise to become part of the score, creating a music that seems unusual, yet unobtrusive because the sounds are coming from real life. Much like the old Warner Bros. cartoons when the characters would create an 'Anvil Chorus'. Greenwood continues this throughout. It is refreshing in a way, because it is so different from a Hans Zimmer, a Danny Elfman and most definitely very different from a John Williams score. Different in a good way because even my appreciation of Zimmer's and Elfman's work is waning because everything they do sounds so similar.Joaquin Phoenix is almost mercurial as Freddie Quell, the disillusioned serviceman who returns home feeling out of place. Drinking whatever form of alcohol he can get his hands on, he roams from job to job, while losing what little social standing he has, until he wanders onto a yacht being used by Lancaster Dodd for his daughter's wedding. He wakes up the next morning, confronted by Dodd. Apparently, before he passed out, Freddie whipped up a batch of hooch and Dodd is eager for more. Quell seems to find a peace Dodd's words and thoughts and eagerly follows him from stop to stop. In fact, he becomes so enamored of Dodd, he willingly engages anyone who criticizes the new movement in a fist fight.Phoenix's performance shouldn't work, but somehow he pulls it off. Theatrical and over-the-top, Freddie is full of grand gestures and shouts, but Phoenix also embellishes the character with tics and doubt, filtering the grander aspects of his character into something more human. And much more troubled. Freddie Quell is a man who has never lived with much guidance and now that the war is over, he finds himself drifting through life trying to find the next drunken binge. And when he finds Dodd, he also finds one more addiction to feed his lonely life.""I am a writer, a doctor, a nuclear physicist, a theoretical philosopher, but above all, I am a man, just like you."" There are few actors who could utter this line of dialogue and make us believe it. Thankfully, Philip Seymour Hoffman plays Lancaster Dodd, a former Science Fiction pulp writer who is slowly building a new religion. When he utters this line, you might expect yourself to laugh, but Hoffman is amazingly believable in the role. You believe in his conviction, in his strength, in his disappointment at criticism. He can see this religion so clearly, why can't every one else?When Dodd actually conducts some of the exercises he uses, I couldn't help but stare rapt at the screen. Hoffman's mostly calm, measured performance makes Dodd seem more real and believable. And when he gets upset, these moments simply round out the performance. The character really comes together when Dodd's group visits the apartment of a Manhattan socialite. She has arranged a party, full of wealthy people eager and willing to experience the Cause. Dodd and his entourage arrive and mingle. Later, Dodd begins to lead a woman through ""Processing"", the other party guests watching with rapt attention. A man stands to one side watching. As Dodd begins walking the women through the exercise, the man begins to interrupt. But Dodd doesn't acknowledge him and continues. The man interrupts a few times and each time Dodd ignores him. Finally, he can longer be ignored and Dodd angrily turns to him, listening to his criticisms and then answers back. As the story continues, we see Dodd demonstrate different aspects of his new religion and defend it against various attacks. And throughout, Hoffman brings a fine, modulated intensity to the role.If Phoenix is the showier of the two actors, he is perfectly complimented by Hoffman's more restrained, but also volatile performance.Amy Adams is also good as Peggy, Dodd's pregnant wife and most ardent supporter. She quietly stands in the background, always smiling, until she sees the effect Quell is having on Dodd and The Cause. Later, she reveals the level and intensity of her power, making her a suddenly much more interesting character.Even with all of these good things, the film is still missing something, something to tie it all together, to make the film as a whole work.Throughout, we see various degrees of Freddie's erratic behavior. But we never see what he is like in a normal state, or at least, a more normal state. From the beginning, he is bored, restless and on the hunt for the next binge. While it is interesting to watch such an all-consuming portrayal of a man's downward spiral, without some indication of where he started out the journey becomes unanchored and problematic. Freddie doesn't have the roundness of Anderson's other leads. An argument could be made that Freddie's days with the Navy are the beginning, but he is already acting so immature, so at ease, there has to be an earlier beginning which we don't have the opportunity to witness.The reason for Dodd's infatuation with Freddie is also lost on me. From the moment they meet, Dodd seems to feed off something within the drunk, lost soul of his new prot&eacute;g&eacute;. And while Freddie wholeheartedly embraces the ideals of The Cause, he seems to have difficulty actually living by these new ideals. Dodd views his new prot&eacute;g&eacute; as a project, someone he can make better and use as a poster child for his new movement. But Freddie never really improves, so why does Dodd remain infatuated? Peggy even question's her husband's devotion to Freddie.There are a few very brief moments when we begin to get a picture of Dodd's thought processes behind The Cause. But these moments are way too brief and aren't hard hitting or insightful enough to offer any sort of comment, critique or insight into the reasons behind this new religion.And when ""The Master"" is done, you still have questions. You still want more. You still need more to connect all the dots.And this has never happened during a Paul Thomas Anderson film before.",3,"2 1/2 Stars - Anderson's Problematic Film: Beautiful, but lacking",1348617600,"09

Philip Seymour Hoffman plays Lancaster Dodd, who is obviously loosely based on L Ron Hubbard and his cult of Scientology. When Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix), a World War II veteran who can't adjust to civilian life stumbles aboard Dodd's yacht party, the two find a sort of common bond with each other. Freddie has a need to find answers, The Master claims he has them. For the next two hours, the 2 men circle each other in a sort of tragic dance.""The Master"" explores the bond between Hoffman and Phoenix and it is a difficult bond to watch. Freddie has issues that run so deep that even Hoffman's ""processing"" can't draw them out. The two men metaphorically explore what it is like to be a cult follower and cult leader. Hoffman in particular exudes charisma even when other characters point out that ""The Cause"" seems like it is being made up as they go along. At the same time, Freddie is so desirous of a father figure/guiding light that not only is he willing to follow ""The Cause,"" he is willing to fight off anyone who dares question the Master's divinity.The movie does a great job in showing what willing followers will do in search of the ultimate answer. Phoenix, as the troubled young Freddie, runs through the movie like a powder keg just waiting to explode. Even in the end, as the two men try to mend their differences, Phoenix can't hide that he is wound up tighter than a watchspring, even as Hoffman attempts to console him one last time. ""The Master"" is not an easy movie to watch. Phoenix burns so darkly and with such intensity that it is hard to wonder if he's redeemable. He earned his Oscar nomination, as does Hoffman, as the bulk of the movie remains unflappable in the faith of his beliefs.

1544646,AJYGQV81FSFE2,B008220DGE,Timothy P. Scanlon,"[5, 9]","What's life without sex and alcohol? I don't know if this film will help answer that question...Freddie Quell (Joagin Phoenix) is in the navy in WWII. He's eccentric, and is discharged with, it seems, symptoms of mental--instability. (Some of the morbid humor of the film comes out when he's describing the psychiatrist's Rorschach test).To make a long story short, he loses jobs of all sorts, concocts alcoholic drinks that'd kill most of us, then ends up on a boat ""captained"" by cult leader Lancaster Dodd (Phillip Seymour Hoffman).First, in terms of acting, Phoenix and Hoffman are both off the scale incredible. But Freddie scared me. He was completely impulsive, had no control. Whether that was a symptom of alcoholism, I'm not sure. But each time he got into trouble because of it, I thought I'd take him off the the side--with at least bars between us--and say, ""Look, Freddie, you NEED to control yourself, or you'll be in one cell or another for the rest of your life."" He deserves the oscar...unless Hoffman gets it.Dodd was a manipulator. (Some of said the film was a commentator on Scientology. But a theatre I walked into had a staff member who adamantly denied it, fearing, I suspect, that I might have been a Scientology spyp; I wasn't far from the HQ). He had question and answer technigues for getting ""into"" you. And Freddie always wanted to go one step further.Lancaster's wife, Peggy (Amy Adams) was mesmerized by her husband and the culture of which she was a loyal robot.Indeed, that leaves to a little of the ""sexuality,"" what which gave the film an ""R"" rating. I'm not sure if she was as manipulative as her husband, but she had him by the....well, watch the film to see what I was going to say. (I don't want to give anything away).A couple of scenes confused me: the cult, ""The Cause,"" was all gathered in the house of a member in Philadelphia. Lancaster started singing a song, and all of the women in the cast were stark naked. I wasn't sure if that was Freddy's fantasy or if they were that manipulated that they all stripped for...the Master. I think the latter is true, but there was enough surreal about the screenplay that I wasn't sure. Then, at one point, Lancaster's daughter hit on Freddie, but later suggested in a private meeting with Lancaster and Peggy, that he was lusting after her. I'm not sure if the theme was that his daughter was just as conniving as he, or if that too was a sign of one of Freddie's fantasies (all related--hint--to the Rorschach test...)And toward the end of the film, after Freddy had found his own way, he was sitting in a movie theater and an usher brought him a telephone. It was Lancaster, calling form England, telling him to come and see him there. Was that another fantasy? Freddy's attempt at self-importance? Or did Lancaster somehow find Freddy? (That, and an usher in a movie theatre in 1950 bringing a patron the telephone, seemed far fetched).The film was about their relationship. Peggy and a few others warned Lancaster against Freddy. ""I think he may be a spy."" Lancaster, somewhat reliant on that relationship, considered the advice, and rejected it. Lancaster used Freddie as an example, then, of how maniuplative he can be. I don't want to give anything away. Suffice it to say I got tired while watching the scene!I'm not sure about the end. In a manner of speaking, the film ended back at the beginning--somewhat like what The Cause prescribed as ""therapy"" for its members. And the unreality of the relationship seemed on display then. Again, the film seemed to be ABOUT their relationship. I'll be reading other reviews to see what others felt of the film, and, heaven knows, I'll see it again a time or two to see what I might have missed.

Whilst on active duty he developed a penchant for making magic hooch type mixes to get through the stress and monotony of war. On his return Stateside it is clear that he has been traumatised by his experiences. He has to attend classes for what is now called `post traumatic stress disorder' or PTSD, and it is all a bit basic, so he leaves.After a succession of down at heel jobs and increasingly erratic behaviour, he stowaways on board the boat of charismatic cult leader, Philip Seymour-Hoffman playing Lancaster Dodd or `The Master'. He has some loyal followers who believe in his theories of time travel regress therapy. It is not long before Quell falls under the thrall of The Master, but as things develop so do the real basis for the relationship and all, as ever, is not what it seems.To say any more would indeed be a plot spoiler. This is essentially a character study of two people and the main leads both take their character studies to the enth degree making even Mr Day-Lewis seem a bit tardy by comparison when he wears his false beard. The central performances are quite rightly at the heart of this and it is their performances that make this so engrossing. It is also brilliantly framed in nigh on every shot, with use of interesting camera angles.Writer and director Paul Thomas-Anderson (`There Will Be Blood' and `Boogie Nights') has made a thought provoking and stylish study of the human spirit. This was Academy nominated, but got a no show. I was bemused by it at first as Quell was a bit unlikable and yet I wanted to see what happened to him. This is also a film about, essentially these two men and so is far from a rollicking adventure.

For those who like film, please keep in mind these critics are the types that think Matt Damon is a good actor, and the Bourne films are what cinema should be. In short, The Master is not for them.Who is it for? People who like something that is a little more contemplative, requiring some thought and patience. Despite what low-end critics say, this film has a crystal clear narrative with a deliberate conclusion. That it doesn't satisfy the Bourne crowd doesn't mean those elements aren't there. They are.This story is about the relationship between two postwar men who find an affinity for each other, both fighting their animal nature while striving for a more spiritual existence. A Scientology-like organization called ""The Cause"" is the backdrop for this relationship, but this is not a film about Scientology nor L. Ron Hubbard. Anyone looking for such an expose is going to be disappointed. Scientology (or ""The Cause"") is merely the backdrop for the main story, not dissimilar to the Vietnam War being the backdrop for the main story in Apocalypse Now.Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerizing throughout, a truly brave performance.

1544654,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B008220DGE,Turfseer,"[10, 28]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Watching a Weinstein Brothers distributed film is usually a hit or miss affair. The Weinsteins are usually on more solid ground when they promote films directly tied to historical events ('The King's Speech' and 'My Week with Marilyn' come to mind). On the other hand, when they promote films rooted in fiction (films such as 'Blue Valentine' and 'Submarine'), they're usually nice to look at but their stories sometime lack verisimilitude. 'The Master' is partially in the latter category.'The Master' is very loosely based on the life of L. Ron Hubbard and his Scientology cult. According to Harvey Weinstein, the film is not about Scientology although the film's writer/director, Paul Thomas Anderson, admitted that Hubbard was an inspiration for the character of Lancaster Dodd (played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman).Set principally in 1950, 'The Master' really should be titled 'The Disciple', as the film's protagonist is not Hoffman's character 'Dodd' but a navy veteran turned drifter named 'Freddie Quell' (played by Joaquin Phoenix). Quell is a bit of a nut case who learns how to mix really strong alcoholic drinks in the Navy by adding ingredients including jet fuel and paint thinner. When we first meet him before World War II ends, he's humping a sand sculpture of a sexy woman he's constructed on a beach. Later, due to his apparent unstable nature, he's the subject of a myriad of psychiatric evaluations by Navy psychiatrists prior to his discharge.Quell fares no better in civilian life. After obtaining a decent job as a photographer in a department store, he ends up getting into a physical fight with a customer after badgering the man by shining his bright photographer's lights in his face. Later, he's chased out of a migrant camp after poisoning one of the workers with one of his bizarre cocktails. Unable to form normal relationships, he leaves his girlfriend Doris high and dry and decides to resume his career as a seaman.Quell ends up on Dodd's yacht (actually illegally borrowed) who soon falls under the spell of 'The Master', whose intrusive interviews are dubbed 'The Process'. Anderson prefers to explain Dodd's nefarious brainwashing strategy in terms of his relationship to the unstable Quell---no conscription of other new potential converts is ever examined. Slant Magazine also points out that Dodd's particular cult hardly seems real at all: ""the film never otherwise endeavors to situate the cult in any film-specific cultural or historical context; as a result, we never gain any real sense of how large or influential the Cause is at any given time, which makes it feel like a function of the plot rather than a central, fully realized part of it.""Is there anything Mr. Anderson's could have done differently with his Hubbard stand-in? I imagine the real-life Hubbard to be far more sinister and charming than how Dodd comes off here. Perhaps his machinations are too much to be expected or simply not dramatic enough, to hold many viewers' interest. Dodd's initial 'processing' encounter with Freddie was interesting enough but eventually the control-freak persona, proves less compelling. With Dodd, there's little change in the character arc. Some may be impressed he turns his back on Freddie in the jail, his rebuff of Helen when she criticizes a word change in his book, his rigid stance in ordering Freddie to ride the motorcycle into the desert and then of course, Dodd's final ultimatum for Freddie to devote himself to 'The Cause' or leave the cult for good. But by film's end, Anderson's Dodd, is pretty much the standard Hubbard-like character we were expecting.Quell, the loose cannon with an uncontrollable drinking problem, is more interesting as the cult members are actually AFRAID of him. The twist here (and this is perhaps the most interesting aspect of the film), Dodd's cult is far more stable than the damaged goods veteran.What does Anderson want us to take away from 'The Master'? This has perplexed many people including myself. While Quell leaves the cult, he hardly can be viewed as having dissociated himself from their negative influence. In fact, while he has sex with the woman at film's end, he recites questions from his initial processing with Dodd.In the end, there are no great revelations here. As to Dodd's (Hubbard's) manipulative ways--we already knew about that, going into 'The Master'. As for Quell, I suppose he's supposed to be some kind of tragic figure that Anderson has given us the opportunity to ponder about. Some have suggested that he's a symbol of a post-war malaise. For my part, I would have much preferred to see a character who liked himself--that is, with some kind of ego--rather the hard-to-believe, empty shell seen here.Hoffman proffers up an Orson Welles-like performance but is saddled by the often ponderous script. Phoenix is too reflexively angry to be always believable. The female characters played by Amy Adams and Laura Dern have little to do, except reinforce our knowledge of Dodd's unceasing rigidity.By fictionalizing the real Scientology story behind it, 'The Master' avoids some of the more troubling issues that have become associated with cults today. The film's strength rests on its excellent cinematography, invoking a bleak, post-war canvas, reminiscent of some of the moody noirs of those days. But the slow-moving story often feels predictable especially in regards to the Svengali-like Dodd, who Anderson struggles to make sympathetic and different at the same time. Others will be confused by the film's overall point, as there's no one to root for, especially with such a grim protagonist, only perhaps very partially reflective of an actual, real person.",2,"Somewhat interesting but fairly predictable tale of Scientology-like cult afraid of alcoholic, loose cannon drifter",1348185600,"09 21, 2012",2012,5727,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain',

1544655,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B008220DGE,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[1, 1]","Very loosely based upon L. Ron Hubbard and the beginning of Scientology, THE MASTER revolves around the character of Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix). Although he is a Navy veteran who served in WWII, Freddie never really saw any actual combat. He's a troubled individual who just doesn't fit in no matter where he goes in the world. However, after sneakily stumbling aboard a yacht owned by the seemingly wealthy and mysterious Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman), Freddie finds an individual who seems to understand him. Dodd brings Freddie under his wing and uses him to help further his agenda in spreading the scientific religion Dodd started, The Cause. The Cause offers Freddie a purpose he has never had before, but it also threatens to stifle his wild and roustabout ways and destroy his very existence.At face value, THE MASTER has a lot going for it. Like most all of Paul Thomas Anderson films, the acting is top-notch. It's a thrill watching Hoffman and Phoenix go against each other on the screen. The scenes where they are together are thrilling. However, these two individuals are just the most prominent in a cast of notable actors and actresses and every single one of them delivers fine performances.Beyond acting, THE MASTER also offers some very impressive cinematography. Paul Thomas Anderson fills his films with cinematic visual treats and THE MASTER is no exception. In some ways watching THE MASTER is like watching a Terrence Malick movie, but a Terrence Malick movie with an actual story and plot.Unfortunately, though THE MASTER does have a story and a plot, it's a pretty paper-thin one. Also, despite the fine acting performances and the incredible beautiful images, THE MASTER really isn't a very good movie. I love movies and often enjoy watching films that other people consider boring. I'm not sure what it means, but there were several times during THE MASTER that I found myself bored and looking at my watch. In fact, I found the movie so boring, that I stopped the DVD about halfway through and finished watching the film a few days later. I thought that if I gave it some time and space to gel, I might enjoy it better. I was mistaken. The second half of the movie was almost as boring as the first.So, although THE MASTER has some great acting and impressive visuals, it fails to master the basics of storytelling.

1544661,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B008220DGE,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[5, 16]","The Master, written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson (There Will Be Blood, Magnolia, Boogie Nights), is one of those films that tend leave viewers in one of three distinct camps: enraptured, annoyed or baffled. The camp you will fall into depends largely on whether you're a fan of the director. In my case, I find myself in the baffled camp. On the plus side, The Master is beautifully shot, with meticulous attention to detail, and has truly outstanding performances by Philip Seymour Hoffman and Joaquin Phoenix. On the minus side, the further you get into the movie, the more you begin to wonder what the point is.The film begins at the end of WWII where we meet Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix), a Navy man stationed somewhere in the Pacific. Quell is a walking mess, seriously alcoholic and subject to crude sexual impulses.  He is also apparently dysfunctionally stressed as he ends up in some kind of mental treatment program prior to his discharge. After the war, he gets a job as a department store photographer, but this soon goes sour due to his worsening alcoholism, aggressive impulses and inability to control himself. After getting into a fight with a customer, he falls further down the spiral, ending up in a migrant farm worker camp in California where his home-made hooch ends up poisoning one of his fellow workers and he end up fleeing for his life. His flight takes him onto a moored yacht where he passes out, only awakening the next day when the ship is at sea. He is woken by a young woman named Elizabeth (Ambyr Childers) who takes him to meet her father, Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman).At first, Freddie doesn't know what to make of Dodd or of his situation. Expecting to be thrown off the ship, Freddie is puzzled to find that he's been taken under Dodd's wing and treated like a guest. What Dodd's status is is unclear. He's apparently a guest himself on the yacht, but everyone defers to him as if he in fact owned it and everyone on it. Gradually Freddie learns that Dodd is the head of a philosophical movement called The Cause which uses a technique Dodd has created called Processing to help people deal with remembering traumas so that they can deal with them, traumas from not only this life but from previous lives as well. Dodd has taken an interest in Freddie, partly because, as he confesses, he likes Freddie's home-made hooch, but also because he sees Freddie as the severely dysfunctional person he is, an ideal subject for his Processing technique which he starts on Freddie while they're on the yacht.In short order, Freddie ends up in Dodd's inner circle of The Cause, somewhat to the puzzlement and annoyance of those closest to Dodd: his wife Peggy (Amy Adams), his daughter Elizabeth, and his new son-in-law Clark (Rami Malek). When they travel to the east coast, Freddie sees Dodd at work, visiting his rather well-to-do followers who, Freddie discovers, tend to address Dodd as ""Master"". As Freddie's involvement in The Cause deepens and his relationship with Dodd grows more involved, he finds himself growing more protective of Dodd, to the point of physically assaulting anyone whom he sees as a threat to Dodd.  Even Dodd's teenaged son from a previous marriage ,Val (Jesse Plemmons), is subjected to Freddie's violently defensive impulses when he carelessly tells Freddie that Dodd is ""just making it all up as he goes along.""Joaquin Phoenix and Philip Seymour Hoffman are both outstanding in their roles. Phoenix in particular uses facial expression and sheer physicality to radiate just how damaged a man Freddie is, moving about at times like a nervous, disjointed scarecrow, barely able to hold his limbs together. You cringe just watching Phoenix's Freddie move about the screen, not really wanting to watch a man that messed up yet unable to look away because Pheonix's performance is so riveting.  Hoffman's Dodd is, on the surface, Freddie's polar opposite - smoother, charmingly personable, more than a little charismatic, and deftly manipulative.  But Hoffman gradually reveals Dodd to be in many ways as off-kilter internally as Freddie is, subject to similar impulses of anger, self-indulgence, and resentment of any authority but his own.  He's just better at keeping it concealed and functioning with it.  Hoffman manages to make his Dodd both affably winning even as he's clearly being manipulative, walking a line so fine that you're never quite sure of the extent to which Dodd really believes what he's saying to people.  If Dodd's feet are indeed made of clay, he himself seems blissfully unwilling to concede even the possibility of it, no matter how contradictory some of his actions are to the things he says.  It's impossible to have a cult if the leader of that cult has not conned himself into being his own first follower.In addition, as I noted at the beginning, the cinematography in The Master is superb, giving an almost palpable textured feel to each scene, whether it's a beach in the Pacific war zone, a late-40's department store, a luxury yacht, or an up-scale suburban bungalow, immersing you in Americana as it existed in the period.  Cinematographer Mihai Malaimare Jr., who also did the cinematography on Francis Ford Coppola's Youth Without Youth and Tetro, did an exquisite job here and deserves a nomination come Academy Award time.But as masterful as Phoenix and Hoffman's performances are and as good as the film looks on the screen, the further the film goes on, the more the script and editing let them down. Instead of things becoming clearer, they become more muddled, with character's attitudes and behavior seeming to change abruptly for no apparent reason. Plot threads seem to veer off into nowhere and we're never sure if they were supposed to lead anywhere or not. One thread that is brought up in a couple of scenes is a strange not-quite-relationship that Freddie almost had with the younger sister of a navy buddy, a teenage high school sophomore named Doris (Madisen Beaty). The scenes suggest this is relevant somehow but just how is never made clear.  Masturbation as both a lack of control (Freddie) and a means of control (Peggy on Dodd) shows up in a couple of scenes, but also never seems to go anywhere.Other scenes were confusing for different reasons. At one point Dodd is at a party singing the sea chanty ""Go No More A Roving"" to enthralled guests. In mid-scene, suddenly all of the women in the room - young and old - are naked even as Dodd keeps right on singing.  Is this real, or just Freddie having a sexual fantasy?  Given how few people in the film ever seem to react to strange behavior, it's hard to tell.  The waters are further muddied when later that night Peggy chastises Dodd in private for what sounds like his having dalliances with other women, but there's never been any hint of this in any of the rest of the film.  Other scenes just seem disjointed, like Dodd taking Freddie out into the desert to dig up what is apparently his manuscript for his second book.  Why is it there?  No explanation.  When it's published, one of Dodd's followers, Helen (Laura Dern), is upset to find that Dodd is apparently changing some aspects of his Processing teachings.  From a manuscript buried in the desert?  Why?  No explanation.  At one point Freddie impulsively takes off, leaving Dodd and The Cause for no apparent reason.  Then months later suddenly returns after apparently having a vision of receiving a phone call from Dodd while sleeping in a movie theater.Another part of the problem is that it felt like most of the other characters were not all that well thought out, not the fault of the actors but of the script. Amy Adams' Peggy in particular I found more than a little confusing. In a number of scenes, she comes across as something of a ruthless manipulator herself, somewhere between a Lady MacBeth and Angela Lansbury's Mrs. Iselin from The Manchurian Candidate. You wonder if she is in fact the force/power behind Dodd, but the hints are never explored and never lead anywhere. They're just there. Dodd's newlywed daughter is sexually suggestive towards Freddie in a couple of scenes, then suspicious of and hostile towards him in others, but nothing is made of either. Clark is openly hostile to Freddie, possibly because he sees Freddie as a rival, not only for Elizabeth but for the position of being Dodd's spiritual ""son"". But the reasons are never explored and Clark and Elizabeth essentially just vanish before the end of the film.The further along things went, the more I found myself wondering what the point of it all was, and at the end of the film, I found that that I really had no idea. Was Freddie changed by his encounter with Dodd, for better or for worse?  Was Dodd changed by his encounter with Freddie?  Was anyone changed by anything that happened?  It was never made clear.  The strong performances had kept me engaged throughout so that in spite of being frequently confused I was never bored, but in the end I just couldn't get a handle on what I'd seen.Recommended for fans of Paul Thomas Anderson, for Hoffman and Phoenix's performances, and for anyone interested in a somewhat disjointed look at leader-follower relationships and cultish manipulation, but with the caution that it may in the end leave you at best scratching your head or at worst feeling more than a little annoyed.",3,Master performances get lost in a muddled and meandering script,1349654400,"10

The other is a mastermind into weird ideas and managing a cult of devoted followers.Unfortunately, not much really goes on here.  The story is slow and boring, but paradoxically the character interactions are fascinating.  This is where the movies achieves value.  The acting.The acting in this film is absolutely inspiring, entertaining, riveting.  If you are an aspiring actor, you HAVE to see this film.  Each actor/actress BECOMES a new person.  Hoffman, Phoenix, Dern, and Adams are the most impressive.  From their posturing, use of eyes and expressions, body language, vocal affectations--everything they do should be studied by other actors.  Watching them interact as their characters is genuine entertainment.The story is kind of pointless and boring.  You may say I am not looking deep enough and interpreting the film as one interprets literature in a university, and OK.  Maybe.  But I expected more from this film.I have to recommend you see it if you are into thoughtful interpretation of film or incredible displays of acting prowess.
