(I love electric/electronic instruments, just not in jazz.) Pat Metheny's work is an exception for me. His work is pretty consistently interesting, tasteful, and musically sophisticated. Obviously, to some extent, one's enjoyment of this video will turn on how one likes ""The Way Up"" as music. But, the lovely thing about this video is a straightforward presentation of this group of amazing musicians presenting this rather complicated piece in concert. There are few distracting camera or editing tricks. Just a very competent and skillful job of documenting this performance. Almost all of the musicians play multiple instruments in this performance, and it's fascinating to watch the musicians move from instrument-to-instrument.",5,"Master musicians at work, beautifully documented.",1374969600,"07 28, 2013",2013,831,"['love', 'jazz', 'generally', 'avoid', 'fusion', 'efforts', 'performances', 'involving', 'electric', 'instruments', 'love', 'electric/electronic', 'instruments', 'just', 'not', 'jazz', 'Pat', 'Metheny', 'work', 'exception', 'work', 'pretty', 'consistently', 'interesting', 'tasteful', 'musically', 'sophisticated', 'Obviously', 'extent', 'one', 'enjoyment', 'video', 'will', 'turn', 'how', 'one', 'Way', 'Up', 'music', 'lovely', 'thing', 'video', 'straightforward', 'presentation', 'group', 'amazing', 'musicians', 'presenting', 'rather', 'complicated', 'piece', 'concert', 'are', 'few', 'distracting', 'camera', 'editing', 'tricks', 'Just', 'very', 'competent', 'skillful', 'job', 'documenting', 'performance', 'Almost', 'musicians', 'play', 'multiple', 'instruments', 'performance', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'musicians', 'move', 'instrument-to-instrument']",N/A

It's almost like having the musicians in the room with you.Sound quality: I can't comment on this, as I haven't connected it to my 5.1 system yet. Played through my Sony TV, the sound is at least OK!Content: 3/5. This is where this disc disappoints. It's great to see Metheny on Blu-Ray, but such a shame that the recording should be of one of his worst-ever compositions. Metheny will be remembered as one of the greatest composers of the last quarter of the 20th century, so posterity deserves a good record of concert performances of his greatest pieces.Those of us who saw the PMG perform 'The Way Up' will recall that after completing the marathon piece, the band then played many of their greatest hits -- almost as if it were a farewell tour. It is a great pity that this disc does not record a complete gig -- just the first half.Most of the close-up shots are well chosen. I just didn't need to see the podgy, half-committed Steve Rodby reading the music that the rest of the band had bothered to memorise. Bring back Richard Bona, a far better bassist!If ever the PMG go on tour again, you can bet that 'The Way Up' will be reduced to a 10-minute summary (if that).

Fantatsic clear picture. I assume thats the only difference between this and the DVD release. The sound is great like every other DVD I have of Pat's. If you own an HDDVD or Blu Ray player then you own it to yourself to buy this for one of those formats as the price on all three formats is similar. That being said if it was 10 dollars more I don't know if the difference in resolution is worth 10 bucks, 480P sure looks fine still, I'm starting to think this whole upgraded format war is overblown. For 5 bucks maybe worth it 10 no. Of course This latest concert is all his new material which was very enjoyable. Its a great HDDVD overall, not much extra content or special HDDVD stuff but thats not why you buy a Pat Metheny disc is it?

1019118,AW1493ZQTQ2ET,B000I5XD10,Irfan A. Alvi,"[1, 1]","When he emerged on the scene three decades ago, Pat Metheny was already a great and innovative jazz composer and guitarist.  Since then, he has only improved, and with this performance we encounter an artist possessing a sublime mastery of his craft.  And of course we shouldn't forget that this is the Pat Metheny Group, not a solo act, and Pat's collaborators are indeed all superb in their own right (Antonio Sanchez especially captivates me).I found the music itself to be simply breathtaking and transporting.  Like a work of classical music, this piece runs continuously for just over an hour, so it's demanding for both the artists and the audience, but we all benefit from rising to the challenge.  Of course the music has jazz roots and elements, but with that distinctive Pat Metheny feel (joyous, but with a tinge of some sort of sadness?).  The composition is often complex, but always in a measured way serving to enable richness of artistic expression, not complex for its own sake.  And the synergy among the band (and with the Korean audience) is perfect, with solos that take their moment to shine while still fitting seamlessly into the gestalt whole.Also be sure to watch the interview with Pat Metheny.  He speaks eloquently from his heart and mind, and in the process he conveys much profound insight and wisdom.  He also provides excellent context on how this piece was conceived, composed, and performed.  As a musician myself (guitar and drums), I gained a lot from his thoughts on the artist's journey.Finally, rest assured that the sound quality and camera work on this DVD are both excellent.Very highly recommended to Pat Metheny fans and to all other lovers of sophisticated (in the best sense) contemporary music.",5,An hour of heaven,1258761600,"11 21, 2009",2009,1743,"['When', 'emerged', 'scene', 'three', 'decades', 'ago', 'Pat', 'Metheny', 'was', 'already', 'great', 'innovative', 'jazz', 'composer', 'guitarist', 'then', 'only', 'improved', 'performance', 'encounter', 'artist', 'possessing', 'sublime', 'mastery', 'craft', 'course', 'should', ""n't"", 'forget', 'Pat', 'Metheny', 'Group', 'not', 'solo', 'act', 'Pat', 'collaborators', 'are', 'indeed', 'superb', 'own', 'right', 'Antonio', 'Sanchez', 'especially', '.I', 'found', 'music', 'be', 'simply', 'breathtaking', 'transporting', 'work', 'classical', 'music', 'piece', 'continuously', 'just', 'hour', 'demanding', 'artists', 'audience', 'benefit', 'rising', 'challenge', 'course', 'music', 'jazz', 'roots', 'elements', 'distinctive', 'Pat', 'Metheny', 'feel', 'joyous', 'tinge', 'sort', 'sadness', 'composition', 'often', 'complex', 'always', 'measured', 'way', 'serving', 'enable', 'richness', 'artistic', 'expression', 'not', 'complex', 'own', 'sake', 'synergy', 'band', 'Korean', 'audience', 'perfect', 'solos', 'take', 'moment', 'shine', 'still', 'fitting', 'seamlessly', 'gestalt', 'whole.Also', 'be', 'sure', 'watch', 'interview', 'Pat', 'Metheny', 'eloquently', 'heart', 'mind', 'process', 'much', 'profound', 'insight', 'wisdom', 'also', 'excellent', 'context', 'how', 'piece', 'was', 'conceived', 'composed', 'performed', 'musician', 'myself', 'guitar', 'drums', 'gained', 'lot', 'thoughts', 'artist', 'journey.Finally', 'rest', 'assured', 'sound', 'quality', 'camera', 'work', 'DVD', 'are', 'excellent.Very', 'highly', 'recommended', 'Pat', 'Metheny', 'fans', 'other', 'lovers', 'sophisticated', 'best', 'sense', 'contemporary', 'music']",N/A

The first three times I heard it, as well as the fourth time (live), I did love it.

It is less lyrical and flowing than other Metheny work, so if you like a more abstract and provocative style, you will like this a lot, and I think many do.  For me, I find the abstract intelectual stuff more accesible if it is within a context that is still harmonic and beautiful and where the tune finds ""resolution"".

Not my favorite PM album but the quality of this disc just shines all around. All of the band members are playing in top form. The DTS Master is about as good as it gets. Pat usually puts forth a well engineered disc and this is no exception. If you have a good system you will be very happy. My only complaint is that I wish the show was a bit longer.

1019127,A6FIAB28IS79,B000I5XD10,Samuel Chell,"[17, 23]","[The following review is written with the ""general"" listener in mind.  The Metheny fan (understandably there are legions) already knows that this is an indispensable item.]This is ""contemporary jazz"" on steroids, as Metheny and Mays have produced a kind of visual music that sweeps the listener along like a John Williams movie score.  It makes perfect sense, therefore, to go for the DVD over the CD.  In fact, the shot selection and editing are so tightly coordinated with the music, it's as though the cinematographer is an integral part of the production, as crucial to the whole as one of the musicians.  (Actually, he is--the bass player.  Wagner would call such an integration of music and drama a true ""gesamstwerk.""  The Russian filmmaking genius, Sergei Eisenstein, achieved a similar integration in his film ""Alexander Nevsky"" with the music of Prokofiev.  Perhaps the best integration of music and film yet is Trueba's ""Calle 54,"" which showcases Cuban and Brazilian musicians playing the Steinway as you've never experienced it before.)There's also a surprising amount of solo space--not much inventive or thoughtful improvisation, perhaps, but at least plenty of room for each musician to display monster chops on limited scale patterns.  There are even some ""walking-bass"" sections in 4/4, providing rhythmic variety and an acknowledgement, at least, of the mainstream jazz tradition (though perhaps not enough to satisfy Django or Wes purists).  At times the melodic lead of unison guitar, electronically enhanced piano, and harmonica synthesizer becomes repetitious (at least for someone raised on Ellingtonian textures) as do the heavy accents on the first beats of measures, but overall ""The Way Up"" holds the listener's attention, creating the sense of a crescendoing, ebbing and surging, rising and falling vortex that exerts a compelling Promethean pull.Throughout, Metheny plays his audience like another instrument, bringing them to predictable applause with each loud climax, then backing way off on dynamics, tempo, and texture before initiating another orgasmic build-up of mounting flame and heat, kicking in the foreplay with minimalist, Steve Reich-like pulsations underlying the atemporal sonic colors, each accentuated by ride-cymbal sprays.  Soon the pulsations take the foreground while the melodic fragments are elongated and intensified through echoplex and doubling devices.  Again, the climax is signaled by the band's cadence and moment of silence, during which the crowd cheers again, appreciative of yet another orgiastic completion.As a piano player who has been known to stay up all night studying a manual simply to ""split"" a keyboard effectively (at least these guys can afford to hire a bass player) or program three pedals to trigger as many keyboards, I can also appreciate the ""extra-musical"" talents, techniques, and patience required to harness the technology (let alone make it work in public performance as it did off-stage).Finally, for a price comparable if not less expensive than the CD, how can you pass this one up?  (Perhaps this is the industry's response to the file downloading that's replacing CD's.  Soon we'll all be hooked on music DVD's, and a musician hopeful is going to have to ""look good"" for the cameras, possibly even enroll at Juilliard, The Actor's Studio, and NYU Filmmaking School at the same time.)",4,The only way to go.,1161043200,"10 17, 2006",2006,3377,"['[', 'following', 'review', 'written', 'general', 'listener', 'mind', 'Metheny', 'fan', 'understandably', 'are', 'legions', 'already', 'indispensable', 'item', ']', 'contemporary', 'jazz', 'steroids', 'Metheny', 'Mays', 'have', 'produced', 'kind', 'visual', 'music', 'listener', 'John', 'Williams', 'movie', 'score', 'perfect', 'sense', 'therefore', 'go', 'DVD', 'CD', 'fact', 'shot', 'selection', 'editing', 'are', 'so', 'tightly', 'coordinated', 'music', 'cinematographer', 'integral', 'part', 'production', 'crucial', 'whole', 'one', 'musicians', 'Actually', 'bass', 'player', 'Wagner', 'would', 'call', 'such', 'integration', 'music', 'drama', 'true', 'gesamstwerk', 'Russian', 'filmmaking', 'genius', 'Sergei', 'Eisenstein', 'achieved', 'similar', 'integration', 'film', 'Alexander', 'Nevsky', 'music', 'Prokofiev', 'Perhaps', 'best', 'integration', 'music', 'film', 'yet', 'Trueba', 'Calle', '54', 'Cuban', 'Brazilian', 'musicians', 'playing', 'Steinway', ""'ve"", 'never', 'experienced', 'also', 'surprising', 'amount', 'solo', 'space', 'not', 'much', 'inventive', 'thoughtful', 'improvisation', 'perhaps', 'least', 'plenty', 'room', 'musician', 'display', 'monster', 'chops', 'limited', 'scale', 'patterns', 'are', 'even', 'walking-bass', 'sections', '4/4', 'providing', 'rhythmic', 'variety', 'acknowledgement', 'least', 'mainstream', 'jazz', 'tradition', 'perhaps', 'not', 'enough', 'satisfy', 'Django', 'Wes', 'purists', 'times', 'melodic', 'lead', 'unison', 'guitar', 'electronically', 'enhanced', 'piano', 'harmonica', 'synthesizer', 'repetitious', 'least', 'someone', 'raised', 'Ellingtonian', 'textures', 'do', 'heavy', 'accents', 'first', 'beats', 'measures', 'overall', 'Way', 'Up', 'listener', 'attention', 'creating', 'sense', 'crescendoing', 'ebbing', 'surging', 'rising', 'falling', 'vortex', 'compelling', 'Promethean', 'pull.Throughout', 'Metheny', 'audience', 'instrument', 'bringing', 'predictable', 'applause', 'loud', 'climax', 'then', 'backing', 'way', 'dynamics', 'tempo', 'texture', 'initiating', 'orgasmic', 'build-up', 'mounting', 'flame', 'heat', 'kicking', 'foreplay', 'minimalist', 'Steve', 'Reich-like', 'pulsations', 'underlying', 'atemporal', 'sonic', 'colors', 'accentuated', 'ride-cymbal', 'sprays', 'Soon', 'pulsations', 'take', 'foreground', 'melodic', 'fragments', 'are', 'elongated', 'intensified', 'echoplex', 'doubling', 'devices', 'Again', 'climax', 'signaled', 'band', 'cadence', 'moment', 'silence', 'crowd', 'cheers', 'again', 'appreciative', 'yet', 'orgiastic', 'completion.As', 'piano', 'player', 'who', 'been', 'known', 'stay', 'up', 'night', 'studying', 'manual', 'simply', 'split', 'keyboard', 'effectively', 'least', 'guys', 'can', 'afford', 'hire', 'bass', 'player', 'program', 'three', 'pedals', 'trigger', 'many', 'keyboards', 'can', 'also', 'appreciate', 'extra-musical', 'talents', 'techniques', 'patience', 'required', 'harness', 'technology', 'let', 'alone', 'make', 'work', 'public', 'performance', 'did', 'off-stage', '.Finally', 'price', 'comparable', 'not', 'less', 'expensive', 'CD', 'how', 'can', 'pass', 'one', 'up', 'Perhaps', 'industry', 'response', 'file', 'downloading', 'replacing', 'CD', 'Soon', ""'ll"", 'be', 'hooked', 'music', 'DVD', 'musician', 'hopeful', 'going', 'have', 'look', 'good', 'cameras', 'possibly', 'even', 'enroll', 'Juilliard', 'Actor', 'Studio', 'NYU', 'Filmmaking', 'School', 'same', 'time']",N/A
