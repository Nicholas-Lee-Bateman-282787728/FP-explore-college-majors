46969,A2EOE85SDD3ULP,078321894X,Alan Dean Foster,"[11, 14]","Once you can accept the 30ish Rogers as a twelve-year old (gland trouble in the family, as she explains in one scene), you can sit back and smile at the situations and crackling (wise-crackling) dialogue scribed by Billy Wilder and his co-writer Charles Brackett.It's amazing to observe how smooth Wilder is in his directoral debut, which is more like the work of a mature hand than that of a novice.  Rogers is simply wonderful as a Midwestern girl sick of all the lecherous big gorillas in New York (to paraphrase King Kong).  Deciding to return home, she discovers that the train fare has gone up and that she can only afford a child's fare.  Disguising herself as an unusually well-filled out twelve-year old she manages to make it on board.  The conductors are, um, suspicious and force her to make a run for it.Her frantic flight takes her right into the sleeping compartment of Major Kirby (Ray Milland).  Scrutinizing  this ""poor child"" out of his one bad eye and via innocence a bit shocking for an Army major in the early 40's, Kirby kindly  gives the poor girl shelter in his cabin.  Rogers' reactions as Kirby ""comforts"" her in bed during a lightning storm (with a meteorological explanation taken straight from Washington Irving) and she tries to maintain her pre-pubescent poise despite their intimate physical proximity are hilarious.Immediately attracted to the kindly, handsome (that uniform) Kirby, Rogers as ""Susu Applegate"" is easily persuaded to postpone her return home and linger awhile at the home of Kirby's ruthlessly predatory fiancee.  The fiancee's sister (wonderfully played by Diana Lynn in 13-year old Dorothy Parker mode) immediately sees through Applegate's ruse, but hating her older sister, agrees to help Roger's character in whatever way she can.Being 12 going on 30, Susu immediately stirs up more hormones at the military academy where Kirby is assigned than a mud-wrestling smackdown between Pamela Anderson and Jessica Simpson.  A more naked portrayal of teen male lust has never been shown on film than the scene in the academy mess hall where Rogers, as Susu, is introduced one by one to the leading cadets who have been assigned to keep her from becoming bored.  What follows is, among other things, a detailed explanation of the military strategy behind the Maginot Line...which proves to be a line in more ways than one.Rogers not only delivers a spectacularly warm and funny performance, she also gets to dance, imitate the voice of the Major's fiancee over the phone, and in one scene portray her own mother.  Adding to the mix her mother in the film is played by Rogers real mother, Lela Rogers.  In a small but important role, Robert Benchley is his usual all-pro bemused self.In the end, the Major's harpy of a fiancee is foiled and the benign Kirby ends up with the girl to whom he has been nervously attracted throughout the story.  Encountering Rogers, now dressed and acting appropriately for her age, on the train station platform, Kirby finally recognizes her via his bad eye and shouts delightedly, ""Susu!"". Wilder ends the film so quickly that it's over before its truly subversive nature has a chance to sink in to the audience (or the Hays Office).  Wilder never has Kirby challenge his paramour or ask her her real age. The two of them simply take off together.This wonderful comedy hails from the age of film when writers wrote dialogue for movie-goers over the age of 15.Nabakov would have approved.",4,Sexier than most of the porn out there,1133136000,"11 28, 2005",2005,3464,"['Once', 'can', 'accept', '30ish', 'Rogers', 'twelve-year', 'old', 'gland', 'trouble', 'family', 'one', 'scene', 'can', 'sit', 'back', 'smile', 'situations', 'crackling', 'wise-crackling', 'dialogue', 'scribed', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'co-writer', 'Charles', 'Brackett.It', 'amazing', 'observe', 'how', 'smooth', 'Wilder', 'directoral', 'debut', 'more', 'work', 'mature', 'hand', 'novice', 'Rogers', 'simply', 'wonderful', 'Midwestern', 'girl', 'sick', 'lecherous', 'big', 'gorillas', 'New', 'York', 'paraphrase', 'King', 'Kong', 'Deciding', 'return', 'home', 'train', 'fare', 'gone', 'up', 'can', 'only', 'afford', 'child', 'fare', 'Disguising', 'unusually', 'well-filled', 'twelve-year', 'old', 'make', 'board', 'conductors', 'are', 'um', 'suspicious', 'force', 'make', 'run', 'it.Her', 'frantic', 'flight', 'right', 'sleeping', 'compartment', 'Major', 'Kirby', 'Ray', 'Milland', 'Scrutinizing', 'poor', 'child', 'one', 'bad', 'eye', 'innocence', 'bit', 'shocking', 'Army', 'major', 'early', '40', 'Kirby', 'kindly', 'poor', 'girl', 'shelter', 'cabin', 'Rogers', 'reactions', 'Kirby', 'comforts', 'bed', 'lightning', 'storm', 'meteorological', 'explanation', 'taken', 'straight', 'Washington', 'Irving', 'maintain', 'pre-pubescent', 'poise', 'intimate', 'physical', 'proximity', 'are', 'hilarious.Immediately', 'attracted', 'kindly', 'handsome', 'uniform', 'Kirby', 'Rogers', 'Susu', 'Applegate', 'easily', 'persuaded', 'postpone', 'return', 'home', 'linger', 'awhile', 'home', 'Kirby', 'ruthlessly', 'predatory', 'fiancee', 'fiancee', 'sister', 'wonderfully', 'played', 'Diana', 'Lynn', '13-year', 'old', 'Dorothy', 'Parker', 'mode', 'immediately', 'Applegate', 'ruse', 'hating', 'older', 'sister', 'help', 'Roger', 'character', 'way', 'can.Being', '12', 'going', '30', 'Susu', 'immediately', 'up', 'more', 'hormones', 'military', 'academy', 'where', 'Kirby', 'assigned', 'mud-wrestling', 'smackdown', 'Pamela', 'Anderson', 'Jessica', 'Simpson', 'A', 'more', 'naked', 'portrayal', 'teen', 'male', 'lust', 'never', 'been', 'shown', 'film', 'scene', 'academy', 'mess', 'hall', 'where', 'Rogers', 'Susu', 'introduced', 'one', 'one', 'leading', 'cadets', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'assigned', 'keep', 'becoming', 'bored', 'What', 'other', 'things', 'detailed', 'explanation', 'military', 'strategy', 'Maginot', 'Line', 'be', 'line', 'more', 'ways', 'one.Rogers', 'not', 'only', 'spectacularly', 'warm', 'funny', 'performance', 'also', 'dance', 'imitate', 'voice', 'Major', 'fiancee', 'phone', 'one', 'scene', 'portray', 'own', 'mother', 'Adding', 'mix', 'mother', 'film', 'played', 'Rogers', 'real', 'mother', 'Lela', 'Rogers', 'small', 'important', 'role', 'Robert', 'Benchley', 'usual', 'all-pro', 'bemused', 'end', 'Major', 'harpy', 'fiancee', 'foiled', 'benign', 'Kirby', 'up', 'girl', 'whom', 'been', 'nervously', 'attracted', 'story', 'Encountering', 'Rogers', 'now', 'dressed', 'acting', 'appropriately', 'age', 'train', 'station', 'platform', 'Kirby', 'finally', 'bad', 'eye', 'shouts', 'delightedly', 'Susu', 'Wilder', 'film', 'so', 'quickly', 'over', 'truly', 'subversive', 'nature', 'chance', 'sink', 'audience', 'Hays', 'Office', 'Wilder', 'never', 'Kirby', 'challenge', 'paramour', 'ask', 'real', 'age', 'two', 'simply', 'take', 'off', 'together.This', 'wonderful', 'comedy', 'hails', 'age', 'film', 'when', 'writers', 'wrote', 'dialogue', 'movie-goers', 'age', '15.Nabakov', 'would', 'have', 'approved']",N/A

46977,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,078321894X,Bobby Underwood,"[2, 2]","""You know Sue-Sue, when I look at you with just my bum eye, you look almost grownup. Sue-Sue, you're a knockout!"" -- Milland to RogersGinger Rogers gave an enchanting performance in one of the most unusual films Billy Wilder ever helmed. He turned the worn out premise of children playing grownup on its ear by having Ginger Rogers portray a child. She masquerades as a twelve year old girl in order to get a half-fare train ticket back home to Iowa. The results proved to be one of the most charming, yet difficult to define romantic comedies ever filmed. The Austrian born director whose career in films began in Berlin as a screenwriter during the late 1920's, soon saw the writing on the wall and got out of Germany. He landed in Hollywood in the early 1930's with the help of Joe May. His ability to write a great story would remain an earmark of the director throughout his long and illustrious career.Writing with Charles Brackett for Major and the Minor, their wit provided the farce, but the execution rested entirely on the very lovely shoulders of Ginger Rogers. Just as in Kitty Foyle, this delightful romantic fluff is nothing without her. She is as important to this film as the script and director, and it is because of her we are left smiling and charmed when the end credits roll on a film so absurd, common sense must be completely cast aside in order to enjoy it. It is the most perfectly executed, perfectly absurd romantic comedy of the 1940's. This film belongs to Ginger Rogers, and it could not be in better hands.Susan Applegate is finished giving scalp treatments to lecherous Park Avenue husbands who want a different kind of treatment. It has taken her a year to save exactly the right amount for her train fare back to Stevenson, Iowa. Her plans to leave are given a damper, however, when she discovers the rates have changed and she is a bit short. A plan soon develops when she watches a mother purchasing a ticket for her daughter for much less. What follows is a delightful farce you can't stop watching as Ginger Rogers appears from the ladies room pretending to be twelve. It's delicious fun for the viewer watching her pretend once onboard the train. She finally gets caught having a smoke just outside the car she's riding in, and the real fun begins!Ducking into the birth of Major Philip Kirby (Ray Milland) during the chase, she finds herself a bit leery of her new 'uncle' but soon becomes attached, heading down the road towards what girls who are twelve would call a crush. Susan isn't twelve, however. To keep the protective Philip out of trouble with his fiancee, Pamela (Rita Johnson), when she discovers Susan in his train compartment, she happily agrees to accompany him to the military school so he can explain, continuing the charade. Pamela's little sister, Lucy (Diana Lynn), isn't buying any of the act, but soon becomes Susan's closest ally in trying to keep Pamela from squashing Philip's dreams. Rogers is hilarious fending off the battle plans of an entire school of young and amorous cadets. Milland is quite amusing as well, trying to shake off momentary lapses of inappropriate inclinations for a twelve year old for which he can't quite grasp the cause. His talk with her about the young cadets is very funny, Susan milking the situation for all it's worth.Pamela suspects there's something strange about Susan, and once Robert Benchley remembers where he's seen the little tike and passes it on, she sets a trap, prompting Susan to leave behind Phillip for the good of his career. Back in Stevenson, more charm and romance are to come, as well as more charades, as Philip makes a trip to deliver Lucy's gift to Sue-Sue. The final scene at a train station is a wonderful moment, pulled off beautifully by Rogers in an enchanting performance. Despite the premise, there is a charm and innocence about this film that is very much of the era in which it was filmed. Beautifully scripted, directed, and acted, this is a wonderful time capsule to romantic farce filmmakers of today could benefit from viewing. Diana Lynn is especially good as Rogers' pal. I highly recommend the region 4 version above this one, which has a terrific booklet about the film by Karli Lucas, and profiles of both Ginger Rogers and Ray Milland. If you need it on a region one DVD, however, this is a good print and the only one available. It is available used on VHS for region one as well, however.

Seeking refuge in the first-class compartment belonging to Major Philip Kirby (Ray Milland), ""Su-Su""'s kiddie act works and the near-sighted Major is completely charmed by the 'youngster'.  But all hell breaks loose when Kirby invites her to stay with his fiancee's family at their house in the cadet academy!  As Susan struggles to uphold her masquerade, she finds herself falling for the dashing Major...In my opinion, THE MAJOR AND THE MINOR is Ginger Rogers' best movie aside from her Academy Award-winning triumph in ""Kitty Foyle"".  She's an absolute riot with her performance, which runs the complete spectrum during her scenes as alter-ego ""Su-Su"".  Ray Milland likewise follows suit with a well-judged performance as Major Kirby.  The talented cast also boasts top performances from Diana Lynn and Rita Johnson.  The laugh-a-minute screenplay by Billy Wilder and frequent collaborator Charles Brackett is still remarkably fresh.  It was loosely-based on a story by Fanny Kilbourne entitled ""Sunny Goes Home""; later turned into a play (""Connie Goes Home"") by Edward Childs Carpenter.This movie has been a long time coming to DVD.

Girl even won a Best Actress Academy Award. Ginger always was a fair hand at her craft, with the acting and the hoofing. She wasn't too shabby with the comedy, either, as this film proves. In 1942, Paramount Pictures released THE MAJOR AND THE MINOR, which is delightful and was so well liked that it garnered a remake in 1955, YOU'RE NEVER TOO YOUNG (with Jerry Lewis playing the Ginger Rogers role), which pales in comparison. Note that THE MAJOR AND THE MINOR also launched Billy Wilder's career as a Hollywood director.This is a starring vehicle for Ginger Rogers who plays Susan Applegate. Susan, after one year and 25 jobs in New York, finally has had enough of the Big Apple and is heading back home to Iowa. At the train station, she finds that she doesn't have enough money to cover her train fare. And the bus line, she learns, is on strike. But then she stumbles on a way around: Children under twelve get their train tickets for half-price. So, a bit of tugging and adjusting and one pilfered balloon later, Susan the scalp massager turns into Su-su, a pig-tailed eleven-year-old girl (but turning twelve, next week).On the train but fleeing the conductors, she runs into Major Philip Kirby (Ray Milland), a military academy instructor and a concerned citizen, who allows the ""lost little girl"" to sleep in his room's bottom bunk. During a train delay, a misunderstanding involving Su-su lands Major Kirby in hot soup with his fiancee and her father (who also happens to be his commanding officer). Kirby then asks Su-su to accompany him to the military academy to straighten things out. This isn't the best of ideas...While I haven't seen too much of her stuff, I do count BACHELOR MOTHER and THE MAJOR AND THE MINOR as two of my favorite Ginger Rogers comedies. I don't know how Billy Wilder pulled it off, but this film ends up a totally enchanting picture. Plenty of innuendo, of disguised salaciousness, but Wilder, very mindful of his American debut status, somehow keeps it all in good taste. It's a sexual farce, yeah, but Wilder mutes it enough that the audience don't squirm outright.Featuring a sharp script and wonderful turns by Rogers and former child prodigy (pianist) Diana Lynn, this lighthearted comedy showcases several funny sequences, my two favorites being the hilarious Veronica Lake gag and the cadets' persistent ""Maginot Line"" ploy. Ray Milland is pretty good as the non-plussed Major Kirby, who finds himself at times oddly uneasy in Su-su's presence. Really, his performance can be second-guessed only when one learns that Wilder had had Cary Grant in mind for the Major Kirby role (and how great would that have been?). Ginger Rogers, who was around 30 years old at this time, physically doesn't really pass as a 12-year-old girl, but I'll take a cue from the film's original audience and be forgiving. Let's just say, she's convincing enough and wise enough as an actress that her Su-su doesn't once come off as annoying. Also, Ginger's talent for mimicry is put to very good use, not only with sounding like a child but also with aping a certain fiancee. Ginger and teenager Diana Lynn have some nice scenes together. Ironically, the most perceptive person in the film is Lynn's character, Lucy, who wastes no time in confronting Su-su (""Maybe you can bluff the grown-ups. You can't bluff me."").For the captains of trivia, know that Ginger Rogers' real life mother pops up in the later scenes to play Ginger's onscreen mom. A lecherous Robert Benchley shows up briefly to inject his wry brand of comedy and to get his scalp treatments. This dvd also offers an introduction by Robert Osborne, host of the awesome Turner Classic Movies channel and fount of cinematic fun facts.Ginger Rogers counted THE MAJOR AND THE MINOR as a favorite, of the pictures she made; it certainly was a hit with the moviegoers.

Rogers does as well as anyone could playing a twelve year old in pigtails, making it almost believable that she could fool everyone.  She's a lot of fun and well matched by Milland.  Diana Lynn is terrific as Milland's fiancee's young sister, the only one who sees through Rogers' masquerade.  There's a number of really funny moments, such as Rogers fending off the juvenile advances of the young cadets, and the hair &quot;epidemic&quot; of the girls at the dance (I don't want to give the funny visual away). Billy Wilder's clever dialogue is a treat to listen to (as usual) and deceptively adult.

46993,A3UGLMD1GKIZGR,078321894X,"Jason Robey ""horakhti""","[15, 38]","I wasn't quite as impressed with this film as others seem to be. It's highly watchable, and I recommend a viewing to fans of 1940s comedy. However, it's definitely not a ""classic"" and I don't think it should be rated as such. I've read the 5-star reviews here, and it seems these people are either big fans of Billy Wilder (director) or Ginger Rogers, or both. If you don't categorize yourself as such, I'd recommend renting this one (or catching it on TCM, like I did) instead of buying.As others have mentioned, this is Billy Wilder's American directorial debut. He would go on to make the best film I've ever seen, ""Sunset Boulevard"" (1950), but 1942's ""The Major and the Minor"" is far from his pinnacle. It starts off great, with Ginger Rogers playing a young 20-year-old, Susan Applegate, who's trying to make a living in the big city. She's on job #28 or so, and her customer has more on his mind than a scalp massage. Fed up, she gives him what for, throws in the towel and makes for home. Only she doesn't have enough for a return ticket, at least not at the adult fare, so she disguises herself as a 12-year-old.The disguise is funny at first because beautiful, classy Ginger Rogers (who was around 30 in real life) in no way looks 12. The wiseguy who buys her ticket was hilarious, and gets a much-deserved kick in the shin. The jerk she sits next to her on the train pops her balloon, and a furious Ginger quickly remembers to fake-cry.Up to now the quick pace and humor were wonderfully entertaining, but I feel that it goes a little sour when she meets Major Phillip Kirby (Ray Milland). As I said, Ginger is far too womanly for 12, so it's really only funny when she's fooling jerk-type characters you're not supposed to care about.So therein lies the fatal flaw. We're expected to care about this man who's too dimwitted to see through Ginger's ruse. Wilder pulls the same trick in ""Some Like it Hot,"" but in that film it works because Marilyn Monroe's character is supposed to be dumb (but adorable). But ""The Major and the Minor"" sets up Kirby as an intelligent person, both mentally and emotionally. At least, we're supposed to believe this so that Susan's love for him makes sense. But I feel that the Major's failure to see beneath the surface instead makes him empty-headed and shallow, at least it should, and a 5-star film would accept and explore this.So this film is enjoyable if you not only suspend disbelief but also forgive fatal story flaws. Once you do, it's a fun romp, and it definitely keeps you glued until the inevitable conclusion. Though you know what's coming, the film has you on the edge of your seat waiting to see how it plays out. There's little that's laugh-out-loud funny after the first 15-20 minutes, but the film is charming and keeps you smiling inwardly, especially Ginger Rogers, who's wonderful as Susan Applegate.So to conclude, ""The Major and the Minor"" is a thoroughly enjoyable but flawed film with some wonderful acting by Ginger Rogers. Fans of hers and of Billy Wilder, this is worth a purchase. For others, I suggest a rental or catching it on TV. I don't think the VHS is worth what it's going for used as of the time of this writing, but hey, it's your money.",3,"A Sober Review of ""The Major and the Minor""",1114732800,"04 29, 2005",2005,3222,"['was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'impressed', 'film', 'others', 'seem', 'be', 'highly', 'watchable', 'recommend', 'viewing', 'fans', '1940s', 'comedy', 'However', 'definitely', 'not', 'classic', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'should', 'be', 'rated', 'such', ""'ve"", 'read', '5-star', 'reviews', 'here', 'people', 'are', 'big', 'fans', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'director', 'Ginger', 'Rogers', 'do', ""n't"", 'categorize', 'such', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'renting', 'one', 'catching', 'TCM', 'did', 'instead', 'buying.As', 'others', 'have', 'mentioned', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'American', 'directorial', 'debut', 'would', 'go', 'make', 'best', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Sunset', 'Boulevard', '1950', '1942', 'Major', 'Minor', 'far', 'pinnacle', 'great', 'Ginger', 'Rogers', 'playing', 'young', '20-year-old', 'Susan', 'Applegate', 'who', 'trying', 'make', 'living', 'big', 'city', 'job', '28', 'so', 'customer', 'more', 'mind', 'scalp', 'massage', 'Fed', 'up', 'what', 'throws', 'towel', 'home', 'Only', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'return', 'ticket', 'least', 'not', 'adult', 'fare', '12-year-old.The', 'disguise', 'funny', 'first', 'beautiful', 'classy', 'Ginger', 'Rogers', 'who', 'was', 'around', '30', 'real', 'life', 'way', '12', 'wiseguy', 'who', 'ticket', 'was', 'hilarious', 'much-deserved', 'kick', 'shin', 'jerk', 'next', 'train', 'balloon', 'furious', 'Ginger', 'quickly', 'fake-cry.Up', 'now', 'quick', 'pace', 'humor', 'were', 'wonderfully', 'entertaining', 'feel', 'little', 'sour', 'when', 'Major', 'Phillip', 'Kirby', 'Ray', 'Milland', 'said', 'Ginger', 'far', 'too', 'womanly', '12', 'really', 'only', 'funny', 'when', 'fooling', 'jerk-type', 'characters', ""'re"", 'not', 'supposed', 'care', 'about.So', 'therein', 'fatal', 'flaw', ""'re"", 'expected', 'care', 'man', 'who', 'too', 'dimwitted', 'see', 'Ginger', 'ruse', 'Wilder', 'same', 'trick', 'Hot', 'film', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'character', 'supposed', 'be', 'dumb', 'adorable', 'Major', 'Minor', 'up', 'Kirby', 'intelligent', 'person', 'mentally', 'emotionally', 'least', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'believe', 'so', 'Susan', 'love', 'sense', 'feel', 'Major', 'failure', 'see', 'surface', 'instead', 'empty-headed', 'shallow', 'least', 'should', '5-star', 'film', 'would', 'accept', 'explore', 'this.So', 'film', 'enjoyable', 'not', 'only', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'also', 'forgive', 'fatal', 'story', 'flaws', 'Once', 'do', 'fun', 'romp', 'definitely', 'glued', 'inevitable', 'conclusion', 'know', 'what', 'coming', 'film', 'edge', 'seat', 'waiting', 'see', 'how', 'out', 'little', 'laugh-out-loud', 'funny', 'first', '15-20', 'minutes', 'film', 'charming', 'keeps', 'smiling', 'inwardly', 'especially', 'Ginger', 'Rogers', 'who', 'wonderful', 'Susan', 'Applegate.So', 'conclude', 'Major', 'Minor', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'flawed', 'film', 'wonderful', 'acting', 'Ginger', 'Rogers', 'Fans', 'hers', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'purchase', 'others', 'suggest', 'rental', 'catching', 'TV', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'VHS', 'what', 'going', 'used', 'time', 'writing', 'hey', 'money']",N/A

Some of the outside scenes were set at St. John's Military Academy in Delafield, Wisconsin.The dialogue is smart & mature enough to hold up well 60 years later. Ginger disguies herself as a 12 yearold to get half fare on a train taking her home to Iowa from NYC.Anyone who cannot see that she is a sexy, beautiful, full grown women is an idiot. But she fools the Major played by Ray Milland. She stumbles into his private compartment, fleeing the conductors.  They bond, in a way that would get him arrested today as a pervert. But it's all innocent & hilarious in 1942. He becomes Uncle Phil & falls in love with her, uncomfortable with the fact that he thinks she is 12 year old ""Zue Sue"".The scenes of her being pursued & kissed by eager, unknowing  cadets half her age, are kind of 'corny' especially the seduction scene when she breaks out in a brief tap dance.This is my second Ray Milland film in as many weeks.

47011,A16QODENBJVUI1,078321894X,Robert Moore,"[2, 2]","Although this film saw Billy Wilder's debut as a director, he was hardly a neophyte to American cinema.  He had already established himself as one of the most brilliant screenwriters in Hollywood, being the idea half of a writing team with Charles Brackett (Brackett's primary job was to smooth Wilder's heavily Germanic English into polished Americanized prose).  Between 1938 and 1941 working at Paramount, Wilder turned out a host of great scripts for such A-level directors as Ernst Lubitsch (NINOTCHKA, BLUEBEARD'S EIGHTH WIFE), Mitchell Leisen (HOLD BACK THE DAWN, ARISE MY LOVE, and MIDNIGHT), and Howard Hawks, (BALL OF FIRE).  Along with Preston Sturges, he had established himself as Paramount's top comic screenwriter, and after Sturges was given a shot at directing in 1940, Wilder was rewarded for his efforts by being allowed to direct his script for THE MAJOR AND THE MINOR.Even in contrast with Preston Sturges, Wilder was a pretty twisted fellow.  Both scripts he directed and ones he wrote for others show his very odd slant on things.  For instance, in BLUEBEARD'S EIGHTH WIFE, Claudette Colbert literally drives her husband (played by Gary Cooper) insane by refusing to have sex with him.  HOLD BACK THE DAWN has Charles Boyer, trapped in Mexico without a way to enter the U.S., pretending to love school marm Olivia de Havilland in order to marry her to become a U.S. resident.  SUNSET BOULEVARD begins with the leading character dead in a swimming pool.  SOME LIKE IT HOT has a man fall in love with a man pretending to be a woman, and refusing to retract his marriage proposal even after discovering his true gender.  In other words, Wilder was a tad perverse.  So, it isn't surprising that his first directorial effort is about a grown woman pretending to be a young girl, and having an adult male fall in love with her.  This would be an unusual situation for any other director, but it is merely typical Wilder.After the ending of her extraordinary string of films with Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers emerged as one of the great comediennes in Hollywood.  Here she gets to play an adult on the run from a man she is trying to avoid, and finding herself trapped on a train with him, dresses herself up as a small girl and pretends to be a pre-teen called Su-Su.  Is she convincing?  Of course not!  There isn't a moment n the film when she doesn't seem to be a grown woman, but this is the kind of film where there is supposed to be a compact between the viewer and the film that they will believe the unbelievable for the pay off that will come later.  Once this small point is conceded, the film and Rogers's performance are equally delightful.  There are many very, very funny moments, and many great comic moments.  There is some debate among the previous reviewers as to whether this is a classic or not.  I'm not sure that clear criteria for a ""classic"" exist, but I think there are a couple of fair things to say.  First, this is a thoroughly enjoyable film with a great central performance and several supporting ones.  However, it is also fair to say that the film in no way represents the very best work of any of the major participants.  Rogers made many much better films, as did Ray Milland and Robert Benchley, and Wilder wrote many stronger scripts and he definitely grew as a director.  Whether a film can be a classic despite those limitations is of no concern to me.  What is of concern that this is a marvelously entertaining film, and that is all that I think that matters.",5,A marvelous directorial debut for Billy Wilder,1123113600,"08 4, 2005",2005,3515,"['film', 'saw', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'debut', 'director', 'was', 'hardly', 'neophyte', 'American', 'cinema', 'had', 'already', 'established', 'one', 'most', 'brilliant', 'screenwriters', 'Hollywood', 'being', 'idea', 'half', 'writing', 'team', 'Charles', 'Brackett', 'Brackett', 'primary', 'job', 'was', 'smooth', 'Wilder', 'heavily', 'Germanic', 'English', 'polished', 'Americanized', 'prose', 'Between', '1938', '1941', 'working', 'Paramount', 'Wilder', 'turned', 'out', 'host', 'great', 'scripts', 'such', 'A-level', 'directors', 'Ernst', 'Lubitsch', 'NINOTCHKA', 'BLUEBEARD', 'EIGHTH', 'WIFE', 'Mitchell', 'Leisen', 'HOLD', 'BACK', 'THE', 'DAWN', 'ARISE', 'MY', 'LOVE', 'MIDNIGHT', 'Howard', 'Hawks', 'BALL', 'OF', 'FIRE', 'Preston', 'Sturges', 'had', 'established', 'Paramount', 'top', 'comic', 'screenwriter', 'Sturges', 'was', 'given', 'shot', 'directing', '1940', 'Wilder', 'was', 'rewarded', 'efforts', 'being', 'allowed', 'direct', 'script', 'THE', 'MAJOR', 'THE', 'MINOR.Even', 'contrast', 'Preston', 'Sturges', 'Wilder', 'was', 'pretty', 'twisted', 'fellow', 'scripts', 'directed', 'ones', 'wrote', 'others', 'show', 'very', 'odd', 'slant', 'things', 'instance', 'BLUEBEARD', 'EIGHTH', 'WIFE', 'Claudette', 'Colbert', 'literally', 'husband', 'played', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'insane', 'refusing', 'have', 'sex', 'HOLD', 'BACK', 'THE', 'DAWN', 'Charles', 'Boyer', 'trapped', 'Mexico', 'way', 'enter', 'U.S.', 'pretending', 'love', 'school', 'marm', 'Olivia', 'de', 'Havilland', 'order', 'marry', 'become', 'U.S.', 'resident', 'SUNSET', 'BOULEVARD', 'leading', 'character', 'dead', 'swimming', 'pool', 'SOME', 'IT', 'HOT', 'man', 'fall', 'love', 'man', 'pretending', 'be', 'woman', 'refusing', 'retract', 'marriage', 'proposal', 'even', 'discovering', 'true', 'gender', 'other', 'words', 'Wilder', 'was', 'tad', 'perverse', 'So', ""n't"", 'surprising', 'first', 'directorial', 'effort', 'grown', 'woman', 'pretending', 'be', 'young', 'girl', 'having', 'adult', 'male', 'fall', 'love', 'would', 'be', 'unusual', 'situation', 'other', 'director', 'merely', 'typical', 'Wilder.After', 'ending', 'extraordinary', 'string', 'films', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'Ginger', 'Rogers', 'emerged', 'one', 'great', 'comediennes', 'Hollywood', 'Here', 'play', 'adult', 'run', 'man', 'trying', 'avoid', 'finding', 'trapped', 'train', 'up', 'small', 'girl', 'pretends', 'be', 'pre-teen', 'called', 'Su-Su', 'convincing', 'course', 'not', ""n't"", 'moment', 'film', 'when', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'grown', 'woman', 'kind', 'film', 'where', 'supposed', 'be', 'compact', 'viewer', 'film', 'will', 'believe', 'unbelievable', 'pay', 'off', 'will', 'come', 'later', 'small', 'point', 'conceded', 'film', 'Rogers', 'performance', 'are', 'equally', 'delightful', 'are', 'many', 'very', 'very', 'funny', 'moments', 'many', 'great', 'comic', 'moments', 'debate', 'previous', 'reviewers', 'classic', 'not', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'clear', 'criteria', 'classic', 'exist', 'think', 'are', 'couple', 'fair', 'things', 'say', 'First', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'great', 'central', 'performance', 'several', 'supporting', 'ones', 'However', 'also', 'fair', 'say', 'film', 'way', 'very', 'best', 'work', 'major', 'participants', 'Rogers', 'made', 'many', 'much', 'better', 'films', 'did', 'Ray', 'Milland', 'Robert', 'Benchley', 'Wilder', 'wrote', 'many', 'stronger', 'scripts', 'definitely', 'grew', 'director', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'classic', 'limitations', 'concern', 'What', 'concern', 'marvelously', 'entertaining', 'film', 'think', 'matters']",N/A

They don't question her about her age, I guess in those days they really didn't care as long as they got some money.  Picture and think about all the stupid things that can happen when she is trying to convence all that she is a young girl.  It goes on like that until she falls in love with Ray Milland then it gets stupid as he try not to convey his feelings about her still beleiving she is a young girls.  It is a very dated story and would never work today unless you make it a X rated movie and sell it to a weird crowd.",4,"A very funny dated movie, wouldn't work in today's world",1368576000,"05 15, 2013",2013,708,"['very', 'funny', 'movie', 'top', 'stars', 'day', 'directed', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'Ginger', 'Rogers', 'woman', 'who', ""n't"", 'want', 'pay', 'full', 'price', 'train', 'ticket', 'minor', 'do', ""n't"", 'question', 'age', 'guess', 'days', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'as', 'long', 'got', 'money', 'Picture', 'think', 'stupid', 'things', 'can', 'happen', 'when', 'trying', 'convence', 'young', 'girl', 'love', 'Ray', 'Milland', 'then', 'stupid', 'not', 'convey', 'feelings', 'still', 'beleiving', 'young', 'girls', 'very', 'dated', 'story', 'would', 'never', 'work', 'today', 'make', 'X', 'rated', 'movie', 'sell', 'weird', 'crowd']",N/A

Although probably not alot of people have seen this movie, you should! In this movie Ginger Rogers stared as a woman who pretends to be a twelve-year little girl to afford a cheaper train fare and ends up falling for a handsome Major (Ray Millano). This movie is directed by the amazing Billy Wilder who also directed ""Sabrina"". The only drawback I can find in this movie is that it is highly unbelievable. The ending is probably the most unbelievable part, but from what I've heard lots of soldiers did that, so maybe I could be wrong. The comedy in the movie is hilarious and you even get to see Ginger tap dance for a little while in this movie. Although known most for being paired with Fred Astaire, Ginger can certainly prove she can stand on her own!",4,"See this ""lost"" movie.",1123545600,"08 9, 2005",2005,910,"['best', 'movies', 'are', 'being', 'lost', 'hype', 'focused', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'other', 'big', 'movies', 'probably', 'not', 'alot', 'people', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'should', 'movie', 'Ginger', 'Rogers', 'stared', 'woman', 'who', 'be', 'twelve-year', 'little', 'girl', 'afford', 'cheaper', 'train', 'fare', 'up', 'falling', 'handsome', 'Major', 'Ray', 'Millano', 'movie', 'directed', 'amazing', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'Sabrina', 'only', 'drawback', 'can', 'find', 'movie', 'highly', 'unbelievable', 'ending', 'probably', 'most', 'unbelievable', 'part', 'what', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'lots', 'soldiers', 'did', 'maybe', 'could', 'be', 'wrong', 'comedy', 'movie', 'hilarious', 'even', 'get', 'see', 'Ginger', 'tap', 'dance', 'little', 'while', 'movie', 'known', 'most', 'being', 'paired', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'Ginger', 'can', 'certainly', 'prove', 'can', 'stand', 'own']",N/A
