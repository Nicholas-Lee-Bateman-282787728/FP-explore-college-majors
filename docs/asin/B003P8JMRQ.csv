""Persons Unknown: Season 1"" has a rather simple premise, but it builds up plenty of claustrophobic, nightmarish tension and a looming conspiracy theory -- the only problem is the disappointing ending.Seven people wake in the bedrooms of a hotel in a dusty ghost town, with no idea how they got there. They are provided with food, shelter, medicine and clothing, but are closely monitored by microphones and hidden cameras. And if they try to leave the town, they are either knocked unconscious or shocked with a microwave gun.So the people have no choice but to try to figure out a way out of the town, only to discover that ""The Program"" has anticipated every one of their plans. Even worse, one of their number vanishes and is replaced by a new arrival, while another one turns out to be a plant by The Program.In the meantime, the ex-husband of one of the abductees becomes obsessed with finding out where these people vanished to. He and his editor/lover end up racing across three continents, searching for someone who can lead them to The Project. And at the same time, the abductees make a final desperate bid for freedom.""Persons Unknown"" is a little like ""Lost,"" except with no magical island and a much more malevolent, terrifying organization. There are lots of plot twists, mysteries and weird things that are going on, and you won't see most of this stuff coming.The writers do a good job balancing the two main storylines, one about the abductees and the other about the people searching for them. They paint it with a gritty, grimy atmosphere, with plenty of bloody violence and sudden outbursts of powerful emotion. And the Project's constant monitoring of everybody gives the series a very claustrophobic, paranoid feeling.The downside? The ending answers a few questions, but it definitely doesn't answer ALL of them... or even most of them. Instead it sets up a brilliant, hair-raising cliffhanger that is almost certain to never be handled.And the actors all give good performances, slowly revealing all the darker layers of their characters -- Tina Holmes as a peaceful mental patient, Chadwick Boseman as a mellow Marine, and Kandyse McClure as a violent ex-con are especially good. Unfortunately, Daisy Betts' Janet is painfully annoying -- you'll want to scream every time she whines about her daughter.Best performance of all: Jason Wiles gives a brilliant, star-worthy performance as a man with dozens of layers and facets, whose conscience is reawakened by his love for Janet. He's tragic, strong, sensitive and smart.""Persons Unknown: Season 1"" produces some brilliant twists and turns, and it's just a shame that we almost certainly won't get the full array of answers.

1356611,A30JVMVY6KL3EK,B003P8JMRQ,Robert D. Watson,"[40, 40]","The major problem that most people have with this series stem from the false advertising associated with it.  We were told multiple times that there would be complete answers by the end of summer, and let's just say that there were far more questions than answers, missing plot lines, and plenty of set up for some kind of sequel.  Now, we look online and we find out that this was not a ""mini-series"" as it was billed, but instead, a first season.  Add to this the fact that the show was often aired at different times each week, and that NBC completely missed airing one whole episode on TV, and you have one of the most messed-up releases of a new show that I've ever seen.  That answers a few of the problems that can be attributed to the show, but certainly not all.That being said, I was one of the few who tuned in weekly, and who saw the missing episode, and I have to say, I found this series rather intriguing.  It works like a combination of ""the Prisoner"" and ""Ten Little Indians"" by Agatha Christie, or perhaps you're aware of the movie ""Identity"", which shared many of the little idiosyncrasies.  Basically, it's a bunch of people who are kidnapped and put in a 1950's town, and you have to figure out just what's going on.  Various obstacles are thrown their way, from the town randomly shutting down rooms and gassing the inhabitants, to the arrival of six body bags, which was supposed to cause them to start to figure out that only one of them was to be left alive at the end of all this.  They try to escape, they try to fight back a bit, but we slowly see ""the Program"" slipping in and taking over for many of the characters.There are some things that I still struggle with, even after watching the finale.  A number of characters come back from the dead, some storylines tend to go nowhere, and as mentioned, there are very few definitive answers to be found.  That said, I felt OK with the finale after learning that this was probably planned as a test run for a series, much like Lost.  Anyone who has watched seasons of that knows that you don't solve much over the course of a single season, and yet that show garnered millions of viewers.  If you liked that, you'll probably find something to like with Persons Unknown as well, albeit on a much smaller scale.Overall, the show suffered from a few glaring plot holes, a bit of questionable storytelling, and occasional bad acting, but like I said, I tuned in to watch, every week, and as someone who has limited patience for television, that really says something.  And if the show is lucky enough to come back again, hopefully with a little more advertising and a little more consistency from NBC, I'd be happy to watch it again, despite it's shortcomings.",4,The way out is the way through,1283040000,"08 29, 2010",2010,2732,"['major', 'problem', 'most', 'people', 'have', 'series', 'stem', 'false', 'advertising', 'associated', 'were', 'told', 'multiple', 'times', 'would', 'be', 'complete', 'answers', 'end', 'summer', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'were', 'far', 'more', 'questions', 'answers', 'missing', 'plot', 'lines', 'plenty', 'set', 'up', 'kind', 'sequel', 'Now', 'look', 'online', 'find', 'out', 'was', 'not', 'mini-series', 'was', 'billed', 'instead', 'first', 'season', 'Add', 'fact', 'show', 'was', 'often', 'aired', 'different', 'times', 'week', 'NBC', 'completely', 'missed', 'airing', 'one', 'whole', 'episode', 'TV', 'have', 'one', 'most', 'messed-up', 'releases', 'new', 'show', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'few', 'problems', 'can', 'be', 'attributed', 'show', 'certainly', 'not', 'being', 'said', 'was', 'one', 'few', 'who', 'tuned', 'weekly', 'who', 'saw', 'missing', 'episode', 'have', 'say', 'found', 'series', 'rather', 'intriguing', 'combination', 'Prisoner', 'Ten', 'Little', 'Indians', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'perhaps', ""'re"", 'aware', 'movie', 'Identity', 'shared', 'many', 'little', 'idiosyncrasies', 'Basically', 'bunch', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'kidnapped', 'put', '1950', 'town', 'have', 'figure', 'out', 'just', 'what', 'going', 'Various', 'obstacles', 'are', 'thrown', 'way', 'town', 'randomly', 'shutting', 'down', 'rooms', 'gassing', 'inhabitants', 'arrival', 'six', 'body', 'bags', 'was', 'supposed', 'cause', 'start', 'figure', 'out', 'only', 'one', 'was', 'be', 'left', 'alive', 'end', 'try', 'escape', 'try', 'fight', 'back', 'bit', 'slowly', 'see', 'Program', 'slipping', 'taking', 'over', 'many', 'characters.There', 'are', 'things', 'still', 'struggle', 'even', 'watching', 'finale', 'number', 'characters', 'come', 'back', 'dead', 'storylines', 'tend', 'go', 'nowhere', 'as', 'mentioned', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'definitive', 'answers', 'be', 'found', 'said', 'felt', 'OK', 'finale', 'learning', 'was', 'probably', 'planned', 'test', 'run', 'series', 'much', 'Lost', 'Anyone', 'who', 'watched', 'seasons', 'do', ""n't"", 'solve', 'much', 'course', 'single', 'season', 'yet', 'show', 'garnered', 'millions', 'viewers', 'liked', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'find', 'something', 'like', 'Persons', 'Unknown', 'as', 'well', 'albeit', 'much', 'smaller', 'scale.Overall', 'show', 'suffered', 'few', 'glaring', 'plot', 'holes', 'bit', 'questionable', 'storytelling', 'occasional', 'bad', 'acting', 'said', 'tuned', 'watch', 'week', 'someone', 'who', 'limited', 'patience', 'television', 'really', 'something', 'show', 'lucky', 'enough', 'come', 'back', 'again', 'hopefully', 'little', 'more', 'advertising', 'little', 'more', 'consistency', 'NBC', ""'d"", 'be', 'happy', 'watch', 'again', 'shortcomings']",N/A
1356612,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B003P8JMRQ,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[4, 9]","8 people wake up in a strange hotel in a virtually deserted town..from which there is no escape.  It looks nice enough, but being trapped is bad enough.  The the tests start.  Our ""heroes"" - a mother, a soldier, a priest, a manipulator, an ambassador's spoiled daughter, a prisoner, a questionable tycoon and an asylum inmate who may also be a murderess - search for ways out, then begin to search themselves.  They quickly conclude that one of their number is actually working for someone else.  Cameras dotting the town keep a watch on everyone.  Paranoid hijinks follow.  Meanwhile, an investigative reporter follows clues linking his ex-wife's disappearance with those of other people.  As he gets closer to the truth (or at least the abductees) we see that the world outside the town is also dotted with cameras.We should be grateful that - given the success of ""Lost"" - we haven't been inundated with horribly uninspired rip-offs like ""Person's Unknown"".  Since the show hadn't more than a single, short season, its manifest sins can be broken down into two groups:1) Nothing in this show develops naturally.  Whether the plot turns or the character interactions, we're told what happens - who to suspect, who will connect, what to think.  On ""Lost"" it was quite typical for first (and successive) impressions to be proven wrong or at least valueless - inventive storylines and scripts redrew the characters.  Conmen were conmen, but it was easy to see how they could fill a bigger niche in the overall story.  On PU, what you see is what get.  Perhaps the writers of PU didn't have the luxury that writers for ""Lost"" had - taking up whole seasons just to establish back-story before confirming what kind of story they were populating.  Advantage or not, PU suffers - it's prefab and it shows.2) What is this show even about?  It's not long before we're introduced to the prime-movers of the abductions - shadowy, but powerful.  They refer to our characters' ordeal as ""The Program"".  They sound tough, all-powerful, with intellects vast, cool and unsympathetic.  The script relies so heavily on their presence for establishing the power they have and the desperation with which they excersize it that we never find out what it is that they are even talking about.  In fact, all of their dialog seems borrowed and generic.  The writers probably thought that they were being mysterious - but it's more likely that they had no idea what they were doing, where they were going, and just crafted a generic set of bad guys who'd fit any plot - biding their time to see if they;d be needed for a sequel to ""Golden Compass"" or a made-for-TV movie about Haliburton.  Maybe their aliens, or demons or just politicians - a Villain for All Seasons.""Persons Unknown"" is a throwback to the days when virtually all TV shows began and ended at the same time - there were mid-season replacements, and we didn't test shows out in the summer.  ""Person's Unknown"" is also like a summer vacation that didn;t quite work out - there was promise, but in the end, everybody involved just vegged out wishing they had something better to do.

1356613,A1SVS640YM7MG6,B003P8JMRQ,"Thomas Veil ""thomas_veil""","[2, 4]","Great series that revolve around paranoia come to TV once in a blue moon, at best.The one that started it all was, of course, ""The Prisoner"", Patrick McGoohan's 1968 magnum opus about an ex-spy who is kidnapped and held in a deceptively pleasant seaside town known only as The Village.Then there was 1995's ""Nowhere Man"", about an average guy who apparently took the wrong photo at the wrong time and found his entire life erased by a mysterious organization.  In a single moment, he ceases to exist as far as his wife, friends and the rest of the world are concerned.And now we have a trilogy.""Persons Unknown"" bears a closer resemblance to an ensemble version of ""The Prisoner"" than to ""Nowhere Man"", but the three programs together are destined to become the Triple Crown of paranoia.Primarily the show revolves around Janet (Daisy Betts), who -- in a neat twist -- is abducted from the park right under the nose of her preschool daughter.  Janet wakes up in a clean yet spooky hotel, locked in her room.  She soon gets free only to find that there are other people in the hotel too.  How many are abductees like her?  And are any of them in on it...whatever ""it"" is?And what's with the town in which the hotel is located?  It's almost artificial, and devoid of people except for our seven captives...and a few others.  And the surveillance cameras are everywhere.  Everywhere.As one might expect, the episodes in ""Persons Unknown"" revolve around who can be trusted, the reason behind the group's kidnapping, various escape attempts, and whether the group will work together or turn against each other.  Particularly troublesome in the latter aspect is car salesman Bill Blackham, the ""Dr. Smith"" of the group, whose actions are impulsive and irrational and work against the good of everyone else.  And then there's the creepy Night Manager, who is so charmingly helpful you just know he's got to be working for ""them"".As this thirteen episode series goes on, we come to know more about our victims, and find that virtually everybody in this nameless ghost town has a secret.  Are those secrets important...or are they red herrings?The town itself is arguably the real star of the show.  It's quaint, but from its center, it's exactly one block in each direction, where the roads end and meet up with nothing but wilderness.  Oh, and if you try to leave, you will be zapped by an intensely painful microwave barrier.  Nice.In spite, or even because, of the fact that the series' premise is so bizarre, its ultimate success depends upon whether it can keep piling on the weirdness.  And oh yeah, it can.  Objects appear from nowhere, and temptations of freedom are dangled.  Like our kidnapped heroes, we are kept constantly off balance, never knowing what to expect next.The feeling of hopelessness is palpable.  My favorite scene of the show's entire run is when an angry Janet shoots out one of the hotel's omnipresent surveillance cameras...and as she turns her back, the camera recedes into the ceiling and is immediately replaced by another one just like it.  Cripes....There are a couple of ways in which ""Persons Unknown"" is NOT like ""The Prisoner"".  In the latter series, the hero was almost immediately confronted by (one of) his captors and given the ostensible reason for his incarceration.  Here, our heroes have to struggle and claw to find out that information, and only manage to scratch the surface.  Also unlike ""The Prisoner"", there is a subplot, regarding a reporter and his editor on the outside who are trying to locate Janet.  Although this plot thread seems superfluous at the beginning of the series, it does come together nicely by the end.Ah, the end.  Some people have been whining about that ending.  I can't tell you anything about the ending except that (1) you DO find out a lot more answers than some of the complainers would lead you to believe, and (2) the ending will feel perfectly reasonable to anybody who's seen at least one episode of ""The Twilight Zone"".I can tell you, it sent a shudder down MY spine.Ultimately what makes this a much, much better series than ""Lost"" (another show some are comparing this to) is that it is clear by the end that the writers know where they are going with this thing.  The scripts are fairly taut and direct, and the action and dialogue are devoid of the nebulous new age BS that made ""Lost"" so annoying to follow.  We are never told to accept that things happen ""because that's the way it is.""  There are reasons behind everything.Had there been another season, we would no doubt have found out even more details about our heroes and their captors.  But as it is, the ending is satisfying enough, although admittedly it leaves you wanting more.  People who complain about ""Persons Unknown"" too much need to go back and take a refresher course in ""The Prisoner"", whose conclusion was literally surreal, and ""Nowhere Man"", which ended with a cliffhanger that turned the series' premise inside-out.  Both of those shows answered some questions, but left other things dangling.  Both of those shows are now considered TV classics.And even if you find you DON'T like the ending, hey...at least you only wasted thirteen episodes, not six years, right?",5,"Shorter, sweeter and more satisfying than ""Lost""",1283731200,"09 6, 2010",2010,5223,"['Great', 'series', 'revolve', 'come', 'TV', 'once', 'blue', 'moon', 'best.The', 'one', 'started', 'was', 'course', 'Prisoner', 'Patrick',
