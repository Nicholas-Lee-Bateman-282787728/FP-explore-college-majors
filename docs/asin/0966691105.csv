167300,ACXHNOC6L8LUO,0966691105,Artist & Author,"[18, 40]","It should first be pointed out that this movie is supposedly based on a true story, the daughter of one of the producers of the movie.  The premise is simple:  it is a (mortal) sin for a boy and girl to kiss before they are married.  So, the story follows Pamela from shortly after her mother dies until she is about to give her first kiss at her wedding.  While, the title is ""Pamela's Prayer,"" it would be better entitled, ""Pamela's Uptight Father's Prayer.""  He uses all kinds of psychological manipulation in the guise of religious piety to keep Pamela from going to Hell through kissing a boy before she is married.I would like to add that right after I first saw this movie I called the Christiano's about it.  I can't recall if I talked to Rich or Dave, but whichever one it was, it was the rudest phone call I have ever experienced in relation to the movies.  In essence, he told me that I was going to Hell for not agreeing with him that it is a sin for teens to kiss!  He also insinuated that I didn't know enough about the movie business to evaluate the quality of his firm's movies.  [I worked in the movie & TV industry for quite a few years.  I've been in feature movies with two Academy Awards ""Best Actors"" as well as a regular in two TV shows.  Even two of my daughters were regulars on a TV show, missing school two days a week during the filming season.]To say the least, I am not the least impressed with this movie, either its story or movie quality.  If you are a ""Pharisee Christian,"" one more interested in the rules than in love, then you might like this movie.  If you are a more typical Christian, even an Evangelical Christian, then this movie will seem bizarre or odd to you.  The only reason I gave it two stars is that it clearly shows how one can become more concerned with the rules than with living the Christian life of Truth, Freedom and Love.[I HAVE to add that the movie cuts off just as the bride Pamela is about to kiss her new husband, apparently because the actors are not married and they don't want to film them 'sinning!']",2,A Movie for Modern-day Pharisees,1158796800,"09 21, 2006",2006,2067,"['should', 'first', 'be', 'pointed', 'out', 'movie', 'supposedly', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'daughter', 'one', 'producers', 'movie', 'premise', 'simple', 'mortal', 'sin', 'boy', 'girl', 'kiss', 'are', 'married', 'So', 'story', 'Pamela', 'shortly', 'mother', 'give', 'first', 'kiss', 'wedding', 'title', 'Pamela', 'Prayer', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'entitled', 'Pamela', 'Uptight', 'Father', 'Prayer', 'kinds', 'psychological', 'manipulation', 'guise', 'religious', 'piety', 'keep', 'Pamela', 'going', 'Hell', 'kissing', 'boy', 'married.I', 'would', 'like', 'add', 'right', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', 'called', 'Christiano', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'talked', 'Rich', 'Dave', 'whichever', 'one', 'was', 'was', 'rudest', 'phone', 'call', 'have', 'ever', 'experienced', 'relation', 'movies', 'essence', 'told', 'was', 'going', 'Hell', 'not', 'agreeing', 'sin', 'teens', 'kiss', 'also', 'insinuated', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'enough', 'movie', 'business', 'evaluate', 'quality', 'firm', 'movies', '[', 'worked', 'movie', 'TV', 'industry', 'quite', 'few', 'years', ""'ve"", 'been', 'feature', 'movies', 'two', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'Best', 'Actors', 'as', 'well', 'regular', 'two', 'TV', 'shows', 'Even', 'two', 'daughters', 'were', 'regulars', 'TV', 'show', 'missing', 'school', 'two', 'days', 'week', 'filming', 'season', ']', 'say', 'least', 'am', 'not', 'least', 'impressed', 'movie', 'story', 'movie', 'quality', 'are', 'Pharisee', 'Christian', 'one', 'more', 'interested', 'rules', 'love', 'then', 'might', 'like', 'movie', 'are', 'more', 'typical', 'Christian', 'even', 'Evangelical', 'Christian', 'then', 'movie', 'will', 'seem', 'bizarre', 'odd', 'only', 'reason', 'gave', 'two', 'stars', 'clearly', 'how', 'one', 'can', 'become', 'more', 'concerned', 'rules', 'living', 'Christian', 'life', 'Truth', 'Freedom', 'Love', '[', 'HAVE', 'add', 'movie', 'off', 'just', 'bride', 'Pamela', 'kiss', 'new', 'husband', 'apparently', 'actors', 'are', 'not', 'married', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'film', ""'sinning"", ']']",Pamela's Prayer VHS

Wow what a movie. the movie focuses a lot on the father daughter relationship. where the father prays for his daughter every night even nights when he is away on a business trip he still intercedes for her. There are times when Pamela rebels against her father and goes out on a date behind her fathers back later only to regret it. The movies tapps upon topics of family, prayer, dating and purity.

167309,A2LNK434OR0WL2,0966691105,Sonny L,"[30, 36]","Pamela's mother died when she was young. But her father was dedicated to pray with her every day, even when he was out of town. He raised her with love and firm rules. She was not allowed to date, and her father expected her to save her first kiss for the altar of marriage. These are hard standards, especially for a youth in our culture. While she rebels against them at one point, she comes to see that her father is right. Especially when she meets and marries her husband. The movie is low budget, and has mediocre acting. However the beauty of the story overides these factors. Much of this story is told through the effective use of music and image rather than words.
