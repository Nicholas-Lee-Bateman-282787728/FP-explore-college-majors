1569814,A2TLCFD8RE12Z1,B008L0YMWS,"AGD ""Jonas Mac""","[1, 2]","This comedy of a young Irish-American Catholic family is a hoot `n' a half and a holler... And then some!I introduced this show to my two daughters when they were still in their early/mid teens and although they think my taste kinda sucks when it comes to TV, they absolutely loved this show, and adored the high-strung teenage Lilly.All the characters are top notch; not a weak link in the lot. Sean is amazingly funny; Uncle Edie, weird beyond words; Brad makes you cry with laughter; especially his Cosmo line (I can watch that again and again and it never gets old); the two boys are a scream and the mother is one of the funniest women ever portrayed on television.I already own all the seasons, but one or two of the discs had gone missing over the years (my girls borrowing them to take around to friends houses to watch and forgetting to return them). When I saw all five seasons on Amazon for a measly $20 I couldn't believe my eyes and had to buy it immediately.It arrived today and soon I hope to have a Finerty marathon.Trust me, if you like genuinely funny sitcoms that are original and close to genuine in their depiction of life with teens; this is the show for you and at twenty bucks you would be mad to pass it up.This will be one of the best buys you will ever part money with for and to those who are moaning about the packaging - It only cost $20! Get over it already!One of my favourite scenes, ( out of many, MANY scenes) is when Jimmy is complaining about only getting a C on a school paper; to which his father replies with such overwrought passion you have to literally choke back the laughter: ""When I was a kid I prayed for Cs""!Hilarious stuff!Do yourself a favour and go treat yourself to Grounded For Life and you will find yourself pretty much ""Grounded"" for at least the best part of 33 hours of top notch Americana humour at its very best.Cannot recommend this highly enough! If only more modern shows from the US were half this funny -They went from Grounded For Life to Two and a Half Men and dare to think of it as progress!",5,"""I PRAYED FOR C's""",1358985600,"01 24, 2013",2013,2060,"['comedy', 'young', 'Irish-American', 'Catholic', 'family', 'hoot', 'n', 'half', 'holler', 'then', 'introduced', 'show', 'two', 'daughters', 'when', 'were', 'still', 'early/mid', 'teens', 'think', 'taste', 'kinda', 'when', 'TV', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'show', 'adored', 'high-strung', 'teenage', 'Lilly.All', 'characters', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'not', 'weak', 'link', 'lot', 'Sean', 'amazingly', 'funny', 'Uncle', 'Edie', 'weird', 'words', 'Brad', 'cry', 'laughter', 'especially', 'Cosmo', 'line', 'can', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'never', 'old', 'two', 'boys', 'are', 'scream', 'mother', 'one', 'funniest', 'women', 'ever', 'portrayed', 'television.I', 'already', 'own', 'seasons', 'one', 'two', 'discs', 'had', 'gone', 'missing', 'years', 'girls', 'borrowing', 'take', 'around', 'friends', 'houses', 'watch', 'forgetting', 'return', 'When', 'saw', 'five', 'seasons', 'Amazon', 'measly', '20', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'eyes', 'had', 'buy', 'arrived', 'today', 'soon', 'hope', 'have', 'Finerty', 'marathon.Trust', 'like', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'sitcoms', 'are', 'original', 'close', 'genuine', 'depiction', 'life', 'teens', 'show', 'twenty', 'bucks', 'would', 'be', 'mad', 'pass', 'up.This', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'buys', 'will', 'ever', 'part', 'money', 'who', 'are', 'moaning', 'packaging', 'only', 'cost', '20', 'Get', 'already', 'One', 'favourite', 'scenes', 'many', 'MANY', 'scenes', 'when', 'Jimmy', 'complaining', 'only', 'getting', 'C', 'school', 'paper', 'father', 'replies', 'such', 'overwrought', 'passion', 'have', 'literally', 'choke', 'back', 'laughter', 'When', 'was', 'kid', 'prayed', 'Cs', 'Hilarious', 'stuff', 'Do', 'favour', 'go', 'treat', 'Grounded', 'Life', 'will', 'find', 'pretty', 'much', 'Grounded', 'least', 'best', 'part', '33', 'hours', 'top', 'notch', 'Americana', 'humour', 'very', 'best.', 'Can', 'not', 'recommend', 'highly', 'enough', 'only', 'more', 'modern', 'shows', 'US', 'were', 'funny', '-They', 'went', 'Grounded', 'Life', 'Two', 'Half', 'Men', 'dare', 'think', 'progress']",N/A

1569822,A30ZT36BEW89MT,B008L0YMWS,happyreader1,"[0, 0]","&#34;Grounded for Life&#34; was one of those TV series that was often shown opposite other highly-rated comedies.  Therefore, I do not believe that it got the attention it deserved. The stars are Megyn Price (from &#34;Rules of Engagement&#34;) and Donal Logue (from &#34;Blade.&#34;) They are 30-somethings who were teenage parents, and now have to deal with a sulky teenage daughter and a younger, active son.  The father-in-law butts into their lives all the time, with comic results.  There was a good reason that this series lasted five years -- it was funny!  Their kids attend a Catholic school, and many can relate to their arguments with the head nun, who still remembers both parents as disobedient teens! In one episode, the mom (Megan Price) objects to her daughter being suspended for having her uniform skirt too short.  The sneaky head nun counters this by saying, &#34;Since her parents have complained, you girls will now wear the jumper uniform that the littler girls have to wear.&#34;  Naturally, this makes their daughter even more miserable!  The complications and mistakes made in normal family life are accurately portrayed (&#34;Son, forget making your solar system model.  We're going to a reunion rock concert!&#34;), and the consequences are hilarious.  This is a great TV series for anyone who is a parent of a school-aged child, or who has a few regrets about questionable parental decisions!
