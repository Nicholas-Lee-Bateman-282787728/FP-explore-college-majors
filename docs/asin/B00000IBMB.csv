The best part of this film is the ever growing list of specialties that Lynn Belvedere (Webb) claims to have mastered, including fisticuffs when his dopey employer (Robert Young as Harry King) grows increasingly jealous over some incredible gossip concerning his wife (the effervescent Maureen O'Hara as Tacey King) and Mr. Belvedere.

It is another wonderful black and white movie. Clifton Webb, Maureen O'Hara and Robert Young are cast perfectly for their roles! Clifton Webb plays the role of a genius to a T. He can really carry off the ""I know everything and can do everything, so you should listen to what I say"" type of person. He comes off a little annoying but once you see that he really knows what he is talking about then you have great appreciation for his talents.In some ways I think this movie takes a look into a number of family homes. A mother who has her hands full with three active children, a dog, a home to maintain, cooking, cleaning and to top if off being the ""perfect"" corporate wife. I use the term corporate wife because part of her role includes going to the boss's house for a formal dinner and then playing cards. Her husband Robert Young is a lawyer working at a firm for a lecherous boss who has a Puritan like standard of behavior for his employees but not for himself. The boss's wife meanwhile is clueless about her husband's behavior at the office and thinks that he is the pillar of the community. There is a nosy neighbor who seems to take pleasure inserting himself in every situation with his neighbors then spreading gossip throughout the community. Like the old saying goes "" What comes around goes around"" Mr. Belvedere ( Clifton Webb) sets things right and all facades of these characters are exposed especially the nosy neighbor.

Robert Young (Father Knows Best) and  Maureen O'Hara (Miracle On 34th Street, The Quuiet Man), typical American parents living in the typical community of Hummingbird Hill, need a babysitter who can handle their three irrepressible boys.  Their advertisement is answered by professional genius Lynn Belvedere, played perfectly by Clifton Webb.Webb had previously starred in mysteries like Laura and The Dark Corner, but really left his mark with roles like this one, the fathers in Cheaper By The Dozen and The Titanic, and John Philip Souza in Stars And Stripes Forever.  It's primarily his talent - you'll easily beleive he's a jack of all trades from babysitter to beekeeper to novelist to genius -  that makes Sitting Pretty and other Belvedere movies still worth watching today, though of course he couldn't carry the movie alone without the tremendous support of great actors like O'Hara and Young, and Richard Haydn (Ball of Fire, Five Weeks In A Balloon) as a snoopy gossiping neighbor.

I number among those who love some of the older black and white movies.  This movie is about a Nanny named Lynn Belvedere who sight unseen was assumed to be a proper woman governess for 3 active little 1950's era boy's.This film occurs in the beginning of the golden heyday of post World War II 1950's Suburban Sprawl out of the city but still near the Beltway - America.  A typical 50's suburban family complete with working father and housewife mom need a nanny for three boys who prove too much for any ordinary donestic. In comes Lynn Belvedere sight unseen and seemingly the perfect woman for the job that is until of course HE shows up!Lynn Belvedere arrives a man who despite his self professed genius does not truly ""LIKE"" children.  Lynn Belvedere understands children diving into their proper rearing with an good engineer's sense of goal oriented purpose.  Misunderstood at first the children eventually come to love Lynn Belvedere and settle down.  Lynn Belvedere soon works is way into becoming part of what makes the family function correctly and is accepted by the parents with loud encouragement from the kids, bird and dog!  Lynn Belvedere cares for the children's health welfare and safety but love affection and such other matters are things he leaves to parents.Lynn Belvedere has some pretty strange habits like standing on his head to acheive inner peace.  Taking walks (constitutionals) to clear the mind.  Chewing food a specific number of times to aid in proper digestion dictums he insists the children follow and they do even the baby tries to stand on his head in his crib.Like any other 1950's suburban neighborhood this one was a regular Payton Place type hot bed of wagging tongues, shallow minds and idle gossip into which our family is soon enmeshed, NOT in a good way to say the least.  Nosey neighbors and puritanical community morrays shared by town hipocrytes force a few innocent situations to a head as sharp tongued lamers put an unplesant and incorrect spin on nasty gossip spread aboout inappropriate goings on between Lynn Belvedere Nanny and the lady of the house.However Lynn Belvedere self professed Genius is not one to be out done as he blows the lid off the quaint peaceful polite society by writing a Tell ALL Book about the towers of moral rectitude in the town as he shares in accurate detail each of their personal failings.  In Lynn Belvedere's book he chonicles the real trueful shameful goings on in the town and even though names were changed everyone knows the character in the book modeled after them.  Lynn Belvedere's book about his experiences and findings regards the goings on in the small town becomes a hit and the fun goes on from there.Sitting Pretty really does need to be released as a DVD because it is totally awesome for fans of movies of this era.  This is a harmless movie that just makes you laugh.  This movie is not great film but it is a nice helpful tonic for a rainy day when you just want easy laughs while you emerse yourself in a bygone 1950's age that never really was the Norman Rockwell, Suburban Utopia depicted here.  This movie is cheap innocent fun and to me that makes it worth a five star rating.",5,Lynn Belvedere Makes Sitting Pretty an Absolute HOOT & HOLLER!

None of his unconventional methods of child discipline would account for the doting behavior of the three boys, and that's mainly why I can't recommend this movie.  Every character has their appeal, but as a group, it's difficult to believe they interact as well as they do.  And the problems that do crop up are equally unbelievable: How could Robert Young be jealous of a rigid fop like Mr. Belvedere?  The fantasy of an uber-nanny appearing mysteriously to enrich our lives and control our household is worthy of a suburban comedy like this, but the story here just doesn't use the possibly delightful premise as well as it could.
