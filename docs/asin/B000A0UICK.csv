The touches of humor, the human relationships, the going back and forth between settings maintains a balance.It's a mix of detective story, sci-fi, love story, and more with a moral-laden ending.Must see! Would have given it 5 stars if the pacing was a little tighter.",4,Psyche and Violence,1237075200,"03 15, 2009",2009,382,"['offbeat', 'original', 'film', 'surprise', 'ending', 'did', 'NOT', 'find', 'violence', 'excessive', 'difficult', 'watch', 'touches', 'humor', 'human', 'relationships', 'going', 'back', 'forth', 'settings', 'balance.It', 'mix', 'detective', 'story', 'sci-fi', 'love', 'story', 'more', 'moral-laden', 'ending.Must', 'see', 'Would', 'have', 'given', '5', 'stars', 'pacing', 'was', 'little', 'tighter']",N/A
918336,A356RFKNIG043B,B000A0UICK,K. Swanson,"[3, 3]","4.5 starsA truly unique and mind-warping film. This is kind of like Plan Nine From Outer Space if it had actually worked on every level!I had no idea there would be moments of intense violence here, but must say that they don't detract much and in fact occasionally add to the overall psychotic weirdness of the script.I felt like I was really seeing another culture, which is a great feeling when living in a country that uses the media to tell its citizens that it's the only country worth living in (hence we can bomb whomever we please!). No pale imitation of Hollywood films here. This guy makes Tarantino look normal, and uses much less violence to much greater effect.The writer/director/auteur Jeong is definitely possessed by genius (and some other entities, no doubt). The plot is truly wacked, and the twists are gorgeously wrought. This is a beautifully-shot film, and on a pretty small budget. This guy deserves kudos and then some for how well he made this come together. It could have been a sick, twisted mess; instead it's a convincing look into an insane mind and and insane era of history on this ever-less-green planet. Just when it seems too weird to cope with any longer (about 90 minutes in or so) suddenly this film goes cinematically ballistic and becomes one of the wildest visual experiences you will ever have watching a film (no hyperbole, check it out!).Highly recommended for those tired of the kool-aid pouring out of Hollywood and D.C.Not many films are a genre unto themselves, but STGP certainly is.Extra half-star for the wonderfully subversive girlfriend character and the special relationship she puts at at the heart of this film.",4,"A fascinating look into another culture's weirdnesses, and one of filmdom's great endings",1203292800,"02 18, 2008",2008,1669,"['4.5', 'starsA', 'truly', 'unique', 'mind-warping', 'film', 'kind', 'like', 'Plan', 'Nine', 'From', 'Outer', 'Space', 'had', 'actually', 'worked', 'level', 'had', 'idea', 'there', 'would', 'be', 'moments', 'intense', 'violence', 'here', 'must', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'detract', 'much', 'fact', 'occasionally', 'add', 'overall', 'psychotic', 'weirdness', 'script.I', 'felt', 'was', 'really', 'seeing', 'culture', 'great', 'feeling', 'when', 'living', 'country', 'media', 'tell', 'citizens', 'only', 'country', 'worth', 'living', 'hence', 'can', 'bomb', 'please', 'pale', 'imitation', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'here', 'guy', 'Tarantino', 'look', 'normal', 'much', 'less', 'violence', 'much', 'greater', 'effect.The', 'writer/director/auteur', 'Jeong', 'definitely', 'possessed', 'genius', 'other', 'entities', 'doubt', 'plot', 'truly', 'wacked', 'twists', 'are', 'gorgeously', 'wrought', 'beautifully-shot', 'film', 'pretty', 'small', 'budget', 'guy', 'kudos', 'then', 'how', 'well', 'made', 'come', 'together', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'sick', 'twisted', 'mess', 'instead', 'convincing', 'look', 'insane', 'mind', 'insane', 'era', 'history', 'ever-less-green', 'planet', 'Just', 'when', 'too', 'weird', 'cope', 'longer', '90', 'minutes', 'so', 'suddenly', 'film', 'cinematically', 'ballistic', 'one', 'wildest', 'visual', 'experiences', 'will', 'ever', 'have', 'watching', 'film', 'hyperbole', 'check', 'out', '.Highly', 'recommended', 'tired', 'kool-aid', 'pouring', 'Hollywood', 'D.C.Not', 'many', 'films', 'are', 'genre', 'unto', 'STGP', 'certainly', 'half-star', 'wonderfully', 'subversive', 'girlfriend', 'character', 'special', 'relationship', 'heart', 'film']",N/A
918337,A17BUUBOU0598B,B000A0UICK,"Mark ""Technology, Music and Movies""","[4, 5]","Save The Green Planetis one of those movies that defies explanation or classification. This film is at once twisted, thought provoking and amazing.  I do think that this has been somewhat miscast as a *dark comedy*, which it could only be for the very darkest of people.  There is satire here, but also gruesome realism.  This is a difficult movie to watch at times, and definitely not for the squeamish or faint of heart.This movie is not *horror* in the strictest sense of the word, but it still certainly qualifies.  There are strong elements of science fiction and psychological drama, but there is also a very philosophical thriller within this film.  If you are watching this only at face value, you will miss 90% of the reason why I personally was so blown away with this movie.On the surface, our main character Byung Goo is the quintessential anti-hero.  He is clearly dealing with many psychological issues on top of his paranoia and obsession with wild conspiracy theories.  While normally some of his tendencies would make him unsympathetic, clues are expertly peppered through-out the script regarding the reasons for and meaning of his mental state. He focuses his sights on his boss Kang, believing him to be an alien, and enlists his girlfriend's help in undertaking his amazingly twisted and convoluted plan.The plot to this movie is definitely non-conventional, but I think the deeper questions it makes you ask are probably more interesting than a literal telling of this story.  Like, what is madness and what is sanity?  Who is good and who is evil?  Are the people who are there to protect us doing us good or harm?  And in the end, what good is love really when the world is so overrun with hate and the pain and violence it leaves in its wake?When I saw this recently, I couldn't believe that this movie had flown under my radar for so long. I am becoming more and more amazed by the depth and breadth of Korean film making over the past 10 years.  Dare I say, they may have collectively produced the very best horror out of any nation over that time period.  That's no small statement.This movie is expertly shot, well acted and by all indications well directed.  If you can stomach the gruesome torture, you will be rewarded with a film worthy of multiple viewings.  This is a movie that should be added to your collection if you are a fan of psychological horror movies and thrillers.Enjoy.",5,Save The Green Planet - One Of The Most Twisted And Interesting Movies I've Seen In Years,1231891200,"01 14, 2009",2009,2417,"['Save', 'Green', 'Planetis', 'one', 'movies', 'explanation', 'classification', 'film', 'once', 'twisted', 'thought', 'provoking', 'amazing', 'do', 'think', 'been', 'somewhat', 'miscast', '*dark', 'comedy*', 'could', 'only', 'be', 'very', 'darkest', 'people', 'satire', 'here', 'also', 'gruesome', 'realism', 'difficult', 'movie', 'watch', 'times', 'definitely', 'not', 'squeamish', 'faint', 'heart.This', 'movie', 'not', '*horror*', 'strictest', 'sense', 'word', 'still', 'certainly', 'are', 'strong', 'elements', 'science', 'fiction', 'psychological', 'drama', 'also', 'very', 'philosophical', 'thriller', 'film', 'are', 'watching', 'only', 'face', 'value', 'will', 'miss', '90', '%', 'reason', 'why', 'personally', 'was', 'so', 'blown', 'away', 'surface', 'main', 'character', 'Byung', 'Goo', 'quintessential', 'anti-hero', 'clearly', 'dealing', 'many', 'psychological', 'issues', 'top', 'paranoia', 'obsession', 'wild', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'normally', 'tendencies', 'would', 'make', 'unsympathetic', 'clues', 'are', 'expertly', 'peppered', 'script', 'regarding', 'reasons', 'meaning', 'mental', 'state', 'sights', 'boss', 'Kang', 'believing', 'be', 'alien', 'girlfriend', 'help', 'undertaking', 'amazingly', 'twisted', 'convoluted', 'plan.The', 'plot', 'movie', 'definitely', 'non-conventional', 'think', 'deeper', 'questions', 'ask', 'are', 'probably', 'more', 'interesting', 'literal', 'telling', 'story', 'what', 'madness', 'what', 'sanity', 'Who', 'good', 'who', 'evil', 'Are', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'there', 'protect', 'doing', 'good', 'harm', 'end', 'what', 'good', 'love', 'really', 'when', 'world', 'so', 'overrun', 'hate', 'pain', 'violence', 'wake', 'When', 'saw', 'recently', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'movie', 'had', 'flown', 'radar', 'so', 'long', 'am', 'becoming', 'more', 'more', 'amazed', 'depth', 'breadth', 'Korean', 'film', 'making', 'past', '10', 'years', 'Dare', 'say', 'may', 'have', 'collectively', 'produced', 'very', 'best', 'horror', 'nation', 'time', 'period', 'small', 'statement.This', 'movie', 'expertly', 'shot', 'well', 'acted', 'indications', 'well', 'directed', 'can', 'stomach', 'gruesome', 'torture', 'will', 'be', 'rewarded', 'film', 'worthy', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'added', 'collection', 'are', 'fan', 'psychological', 'horror', 'movies', 'thrillers.Enjoy']",N/A
918338,A2WV3PH046VUK8,B000A0UICK,"Pansori ""Lee M""","[5, 5]","I was unprepared for the level of violence in the film, and was *this close* to turning it off, but opted not to. I'm glad I didn't. STGP is about a deranged young man (Ha Kyun Shin) who is convinced that aliens from Andromeda are trying to destroy the world. His chubby girlfriend as his accomplice, he kidnaps the head of a business who he believes is the only one who can communicate with the Head Prince of Andromeda.I wasn't sure what to expect from Save the Green Planet, but one thing I was unprepared for was the amount of violence. I'm not much into violent movies (I shut off Ichi after the first ten minutes) but I stuck with it because I love Ha Kyun Shin. In the end, it turns out the violence is for a purpose, it is not meaningless, and it makes you think twice.Another thing I liked about this movie was the relationship between the deranged young man and his girlfriend. The girl was not your typical asian beauty that you would expect. She's chubby, homely and insecure, and the perfect match for Ha Kyun. Ha Kyun's character genuinely loves her, but does not realize how much until she is gone.There is a message in this movie, that is very clear at the end. And if you stick with the film through the ending credits you will see clips with the main characters that will break anyone's heart.",4,Not for the squeemish...,1149984000,"06 11, 2006",2006,1311,"['was', 'unprepared', 'level', 'violence', 'film', 'was', '*this', 'close*', 'turning', 'off', 'opted', 'not', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'STGP', 'deranged', 'young', 'man', 'Ha', 'Kyun', 'Shin', 'who', 'convinced', 'aliens', 'Andromeda', 'are', 'trying', 'destroy', 'world', 'chubby', 'girlfriend', 'accomplice', 'head', 'business', 'who', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'communicate', 'Head', 'Prince', 'Andromeda.I', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'Save', 'Green', 'Planet', 'one', 'thing', 'was', 'unprepared', 'was', 'amount', 'violence', ""'m"", 'not', 'much', 'violent', 'movies', 'shut', 'off', 'Ichi', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'stuck', 'love', 'Ha', 'Kyun', 'Shin', 'end', 'out', 'violence', 'purpose', 'not', 'meaningless', 'think', 'thing', 'liked', 'movie', 'was', 'relationship', 'deranged', 'young', 'man', 'girlfriend', 'girl', 'was', 'not', 'typical', 'asian', 'beauty', 'would', 'expect', 'chubby', 'homely', 'insecure', 'perfect', 'match', 'Ha', 'Kyun', 'Ha', 'Kyun', 'character', 'genuinely', 'not', 'realize', 'how', 'much', 'gone.There', 'message', 'movie', 'very', 'clear', 'end', 'stick', 'film', 'ending', 'credits', 'will', 'see', 'clips', 'main', 'characters', 'will', 'break', 'anyone', 'heart']",N/A
918339,A8QCB68UL50NX,B000A0UICK,Subterranean,"[12, 12]","""Save The Green Planet"" is many things. It is funny, parodic and innovative. It is well made, although the story isn't terribly well constructed. It is sickeningly violent and gruesome, maddeningly cagey about its plot points, and completely and utterly insane. It's also a great movie, because of everything above.It's important to note that this is not a film for everyone. The torture scenes are painful and plentiful, and make up the bulk of the film. They are NOT done in a slapstick fashion, as the title and opening sequence might suggest. There is repeated electroshock, stabbings, stranglings and an even gorier plot twist later on. Suffice it to say, this isn't a kids movie.""Save The Green Planet"" is about Byung Goo, a man who is even more messed up than is initially revealed when he begins saying that wealthy, successful industrialist Kang is an alien from the planet Andromeda. In fact, Byung Goo is patently psychotic, a kidnapper who cons his tightrope-dancing girlfriend into helping him carry out his paranoid schemes.All the while, he pops powerful metamphetamines, robs banks to take care of his comatose mother, raises bees and creates manniquins. Byung Goo becomes the movie's simultaneous hero and villain, and it's clear that our sympathies are supposed to lie with this utterly screwed up loser. The odd thing is, more often than not, we do sympathize with him.If you think that's weird enough as it is, the movie doesn't stop there. The tone swerves wildly from whacked-out comedy to brutal violence to teeth-on-edge suspense, swinging from one to the other as rapidly and disorientingly as possible. The plot is equally wobbly, the psychopathically quick and risky twists constantly threatening to lose the viewer. Some serious suspension of disbelief is required much of the time, just because it's unrealistic that several main characters haven't died from all the damage they've sustained.But as many things that can be said against it can also be said for it. ""Save the Green Planet"" is a true original, a movie that only a total mind-job could make and is interesting, if not always pleasant, to watch. It helps that there are a number of entertaining references dispersed every so often to keep the viewer going, and that there's the occaisional glimmer of sanity in everything that's so terribly off-kilter. The filmmaking is as good as anything else in the film, well-executed and often joltingly original. It's a visionary film, if an undeniably strange one.",4,"Twisted, strange and wrong...
