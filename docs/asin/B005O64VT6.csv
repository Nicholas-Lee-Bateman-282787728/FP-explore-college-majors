1496208,AQ2UN38CMK119,B005O64VT6,P. Mann,"[1, 1]","The teenage son of a mother who must work on Christmas and will soon lose her job has given up on Christmas spirit. One night, he is visited by an Angel, Hope, who tells him that he must spread the spirit. He ends up in Malibu at the modestly luxurious home of a family that sorely needs the spirit. Using the pretext that he is the friend of the daughter, he ingratiates himself with the family, all of whom are unhappy with each other, at least at the start.Like many Christmas movies, this one is entirely predictable, and it's suiting that Maureen McCormick has a brief role here since the predictability level here is on about the same level asA Very Brady Christmas. That said, there is still a warmth here, primarily because of the presence of Alexandra Paul and Jason Brooks as the married couple living in the Malibu home. They truly save the film, and their performances seem to be infectious, for everyone is better in the scenes with them. (This point is important since the film starts so awkwardly with scenes that simply are not convincing.)In the end, the film delivers on its promise and even has a few pleasant moments along the way, notably the arrival of the grandmother (Janet Carroll in one of the last roles of her life). There is nothing particularly surprising her, and there certainly are scenes that could have been improved and decisions (such as the voice over for the dog) that probably should not have been made. But there is a well-established blueprint for many Christmas movies, and as long as the movies stick to that blueprint, they work, at least to some degree.For those who are interested, this movie seems entirely family friendly. I cannot recall any swearing, and there is no violence. There is also, for those who care, no religious content except in a vague way with the existence of an angel.",3,"No surprises here, but there are a few good moments",1351555200,"10 30, 2012",2012,1837,"['teenage', 'son', 'mother', 'who', 'must', 'work', 'Christmas', 'will', 'soon', 'lose', 'job', 'given', 'up', 'Christmas', 'spirit', 'One', 'night', 'visited', 'Angel', 'Hope', 'who', 'must', 'spread', 'spirit', 'up', 'Malibu', 'modestly', 'luxurious', 'home', 'family', 'sorely', 'spirit', 'Using', 'pretext', 'friend', 'daughter', 'family', 'whom', 'are', 'unhappy', 'other', 'least', 'start.Like', 'many', 'Christmas', 'movies', 'one', 'entirely', 'predictable', 'suiting', 'Maureen', 'McCormick', 'brief', 'role', 'here', 'predictability', 'level', 'here', 'same', 'level', 'asA', 'Very', 'Brady', 'Christmas', 'said', 'still', 'warmth', 'here', 'primarily', 'presence', 'Alexandra', 'Paul', 'Jason', 'Brooks', 'married', 'couple', 'living', 'Malibu', 'home', 'truly', 'save', 'film', 'performances', 'seem', 'be', 'infectious', 'everyone', 'better', 'scenes', 'point', 'important', 'film', 'so', 'awkwardly', 'scenes', 'simply', 'are', 'not', 'convincing', 'end', 'film', 'delivers', 'promise', 'even', 'few', 'pleasant', 'moments', 'way', 'notably', 'arrival', 'grandmother', 'Janet', 'Carroll', 'one', 'last', 'roles', 'life', 'nothing', 'particularly', 'surprising', 'certainly', 'are', 'scenes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'improved', 'decisions', 'such', 'voice', 'dog', 'probably', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'well-established', 'blueprint', 'many', 'Christmas', 'movies', 'as', 'long', 'movies', 'stick', 'blueprint', 'work', 'least', 'degree.For', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'movie', 'entirely', 'family', 'friendly', 'can', 'not', 'recall', 'swearing', 'violence', 'also', 'who', 'care', 'religious', 'content', 'vague', 'way', 'existence', 'angel']",Christmas Spirit
