747510,AP1RICQOPPTQ1,B00008V2UT,C.,"[0, 0]","A lot of people say this movie isn't part of the &#34;Zombie&#34; series (&#34;Zombi 2,&#34; &#34;Zombi 3,&#34; &#34;Zombie 4: After Death,&#34; &#34;Zombie 5: Killing Birds,&#34; or more accurately &#34;Zombie,&#34; &#34;Zombie 2,&#34; &#34;Zombie 3,&#34; and &#34;Zombie 4,&#34; respectively.) However, given that it was later given the dominant title &#34;Zombie 5&#34; (despite it being the fourth film in the series) over &#34;Killing Birds,&#34; I do see the connections between this film and the two Lucio Fulci &#34;Zombie&#34; (&#34;Zombi 2&#34; and &#34;Zombi 3&#34; or &#34;Zombie&#34; and &#34;Zombie 2,&#34; respectively) movies and Claudio Fragasso's &#34;Zombie 4: After Death&#34;/&#34;Zombie 3.&#34; This one was filmed about a year before &#34;After Death&#34; was released, and what happened, I think, was that the Italian backers of the film panicked and decided to have bits and pieces of the screenplay rewritten to tie in with the &#34;Zombie&#34; movies-- if you watch the film as closely as I did, you'll see exactly what I'm talking about. About a quarter into the movie the seemingly dominant avian theme is thrown out the window in favor of a supernatural thriller/undead slasher type film. So, what's &#34;Zombie 5: Killing Birds&#34; about? Well, I'll tell you...The movie begins sometime after or perhaps during the Vietnam War, a war veteran returns to his home in the swampland boondocks of Florida, bearing a gift for his wife, only to find her in bed with another man. He proceeds to go on a killing rampage, murdering his wife, her lover and an elderly couple with a baby (but not the baby) in cold blood before the birds in his enclosed porch in fanciful cages begin to shriek with terror and birds descend from the sky and pluck out his eyes. We move ahead about twenty-some years to a college where a Doctor Green (played by a real life Doctor named John H. Green) is helping a college student named Anne investigate the dwindling species of a rare bird. She assembles a team of five other people to go and seek out the last few people who have seen the bird, the only known living witness of this rare creature being an elderly, blind war veteran played by Robert Vaughn, named Doctor Fred Brown. The trip's benefactor, Doctor Green hires a driver named Brian, who drives them deep into the Florida marshes. One of the students is named Steven, and when Steven and Anne go to Doctor Brown's house and meet him, they begin to suspect things are decidedly not as they seem as the man, a gentleman, albeit an uncouth recluse, seems to be hiding something. They leave Doctor Brown and venture deeper into the marshes where they discover an ancient pickup truck that seems to have been in a state of neglect for decades. The nerdy girl in the group, Jennifer, opens the door of the pickup truck and a corpse falls out. Their own van is in need of some repairs to the team takes up shelter in an abandoned house-- that just happens to be the site of the murders at the beginning of the movie.Brian and the inexplicable computer geek of the group, Rob, get a generator in the basement running and get the lights on in the house. Rob carries around what must be an eighty pound laptop (circa 1987) and uses it to make Vector-graphics based pornography because as he explains to Steve earlier in the movie &#34;It's what puts bread on the table.&#34; Meanwhile, the jock-type jerk of the group, Paul and the loose girl of the group, Mary quickly find a bed to copulate in, and that's when the weirdness starts. As they engage in intercourse, Steve begins to hallucinate, he has a rather surreal vision of Anne being crucified to the wall of one of the rooms near the empty aviary (which is full of empty birdcages in which the birds at the beginning of the movie were seen going insane), after that, Mary begins to hallucinate and then all hell breaks loose when Jennifer gets killed by a zombie and the bodies start piling up like meat on the scale at the deli.I don't want to give too much else away about the film itself, if you really want to know, you either will buy the film or you already own the video. The film is of Italian design, as are all the films in the &#34;Zombie&#34; series, but where the first three in the series are all connected by certain directors, writers and actors, &#34;Zombie 5: Killing Birds&#34; is connected by a thread, in that, as I already stated, it went into the production the year before &#34;After Death&#34; was released and I believe that the film's two directors, who are primarily known for being pornographers (perhaps echoed by Rob's computer animations in the film) saw an opportunity to cash in on the success of the &#34;Zombie&#34; films and had parts of a preexisting screenplay rewritten or even parts of their finished film reshot in order to tie in with the &#34;Zombie&#34; series. But how does it tie in with the &#34;Zombie&#34; series? Well, for starters, it features zombies-- a lot of people are claiming that zombies don't show up until the last ten minutes of the film, which is a common misconception, as there are plenty of zombies seen throughout the course of the movie, but it's only in the final ten minutes of the film that full-blown zombie chaos occurs. The zombies in this movie are far closer to the kind of zombies first seen in Fulci's &#34;Zombi 3&#34; (&#34;Zombie 2&#34;) and later expanded upon in Fragasso's &#34;Zombie 4: After Death&#34; (&#34;Zombie 3&#34;), that kind of zombie being agile, quick, unusually intelligent and not necessarily flesh eating. Following in &#34;After Death&#34;'s footsteps, the zombies are of a more supernatural origin than they're portrayed as being in the first two films (although a case could be argued for or against the supernatural origin in the first and second films, especially the first with the prominent voodoo theme being prevalent in all of them). As well as capitalizing upon the &#34;Zombie&#34; franchise, &#34;Killing Birds&#34; also takes nods from the &#34;Evil Dead&#34; films, particularly seen in Steve's big hallucination sequences when doors open as the camera chases an unseen force around the house in an almost &#34;Looney Toons&#34; fashion &agrave; la &#34;The Shining.&#34;The make-up effects in the movie range from brilliant to dreadful, the more prominent being the latter. Most of the zombies seen in the film are so heavily decayed that the make-up artist must have been confused by what direction to take them in and rushed the process in the end leaving much to be desired. That said, some of the gore effects are extremely well done, the beheading of one of the characters towards the very end of the film comes to mind, as does another character getting his hand caught in the spinning gears of the basement generator in another scene earlier in the movie. The same can be said of the special effects, some of them are absolutely gorgeous, especially considering the budget, others have no excuse to be so poor. The best effect in the movie by far is the scene where one of the characters is completely immolated by fire and runs screaming into the darkness-- it looks very real, probably because it IS real. I don't think they could even afford a fire-retardant suit so they just doused the actor in kerosene and lit him on fire and yelled &#34;ACTION!&#34; But then there's the overlay birds, which are the 1980s equivalent of dangling a bat on a string in front of the camera and calling it a dragon. But what it all comes down to in the end is, is it worth watching?The answer, surprisingly, is yes. It acts somewhat as a 'prequel' to the rest of the &#34;Zombie&#34; movies, perhaps even giving a viable explanation for the zombies' presence on Earth. They're referred to as &#34;lost souls&#34; who &#34;feed on fear,&#34; and they seem to travel in and out of different planes of reality, inter-dimensional tripping and gateways between the human mind and the Gates of Hell itself. If you make a few free associations, one can be lead to assume that these creatures' presence opened doorways around the world which caused the zombie outbreaks seen in the first and third films in the series, the second film being a scientific take on everything, yet in the end ultimately being taken over by the hoodoo voodoo magic of the living dead seen in every film in the series. While the movie has an incredibly heavy &#34;Scooby Doo&#34; feel to it and it takes on the basic structure of your garden variety slasher film, it is better than say, &#34;Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen&#34; or &#34;The Sum of All Fears.&#34; Did I like the movie? Yes, I liked a lot.Like I've said in my reviews for the other three movies in the series, Shriek Show does an excellent job with the DVD, here. The artwork on the cover is gorgeous, as is the disc for the film itself inside a standard keep case. There aren't many special features to write home about, except for a ten minute interview with Robert Vaughn about his role in the film and some of his other films, like &#34;Teenage Caveman&#34; and &#34;Battle Beyond the Stars.&#34; There's a &#34;picture gallery&#34; which is just a few shots of some one-sheets for the movie set to music from the film's score. Then there's four trailers, &#34;Zombi 2,&#34; &#34;Killing Birds,&#34; &#34;Black Demons&#34; and &#34;Flesh For The Beast.&#34; Now, I watched all the trailers, but as soon as the trailer for &#34;Flesh For the Beast&#34; (a movie completely unrelated to &#34;Zombie 5: Killing Birds!&#34;) was over, a THIRTY FIVE MINUTE LONG DOCUMENTARY on the making of &#34;Flesh For The Beast&#34; began to play. I'm not sure if this is a glitch on the DVD I got, like, maybe it's a misprint or something or a goof, but a thirty five minute documentary about the making of this completely unrelated movie plays after you watch the trailer for it. It's just weird and I'm not sure why it's on there at all. That's all the special features on the DVD. I'm a little disappointed there were no subtitles as the actress who portrayed Anne speaks with a heavy German accent and they didn't bother to dub her the way they dubbed some of the Italian actors in the film who probably spoke their lines phonetically. I digress.If I were to try to look for a message in the movie, I'd say it's that the Vietnam War was just bad for everyone, but that's something said in so many movies, already. Maybe you want to think of it as a movie about heritage, legacy, bloodlines and family, all themes loosely portrayed in the film. It can be whatever you want it to be, I guess. It's not a zombie film you need, but one you deserve. All in all, &#34;Zombie 5: Killing Birds,&#34; or, as it is by its proper title, &#34;Zombie 4,&#34; is a movie that probably isn't going to satisfy everyone and is for completionists and die-hard fans of Italian horror or Robert Vaughn. But for the low price, there really isn't a reason not to own the movie if you're an avid horror movie fan and/or DVD collector. If you see it, pick it up, it makes for a good way to pass some time on a rainy Wednesday afternoon with your friends over a few drinks and some Chinese food.",5,"The Origins of the Living Dead and

747511,A37OOQQLMMKYR8,B00008V2UT,Dave. K,"[1, 1]","This movie is the type that makes you wanna rip your eyes out and stab yourself in the ears so you don't have to see or hear anything.After the movie is over you cannot wait to get it out of your DVD player, but when you look back you'll see it's actually kind of fun, so all is not lost.Lets face it horror movies aren't know for having the smartest characters, but when in a situation like that it's quite possible to do things you shouldn't. But the characters in Killing Birds are some of the dumbest I have ever seen.They are just total morons. Normally something like that can be fun, but here it's a bit annoying.One of my favorite parts is when one guy gets stuck in the generator and his friend just looks on in horror. Seriously the guy just stands there and watches. How about maybe you try and help him?? That is just an idea, but yeah maybe try and save the guy?Then when he goes and tells the others he says, ""they got him."" Who are they? Ain't nobody got him you idiot. He got stuck in the generator and you just watched.The biggest problem with Killing Birds is it's just too damn slow. The movie starts off with some action and after that nothing happens. We meet the main characters follow them around a bit. Still nothing happening, finally towards the very end the action starts up.I'm all for slow burn movies, but this was just boring.Claudio Lattanzi is credited as director, but Killing Birds was actually directed by Joe D'Amato. I'm not sure if Lattanzi co-directed, but it was D'Amato. His name was left off due to over-exposure.Though if you watch the movie in the credit sequence Lattanzi isn't credited, but another name is, that is very common in Italian movies. They often use names that sound more American.Hard to believe Joe D'Amato who did the classic Beyond the Darkness is responsible for this. Joe D'Amato has had a strange career.Some classics and a lot of trash like this. Joe D'Amato was also a producer and the director of photography so he has to get a lot of the blame. The script is terrible if you can even call it a script.To D'Amato's credit he does try and build some tension and had the movie been more interesting with more likeable characters maybe it would have sort of worked. Killing Birds wouldn't keep you on the edge of your seat or anything, but D'Amato does manage some decent tension.There is a lot of other problems here, for instance what the hell is the deal with this movie?It starts out as a slsher flick than it seems it has something to do with birds than in the middle it has a little bit of a haunted house style than a zombie flick and finally we go back to the birds. All I wanna know is what the birds had to do with anything?This was truly a low point in the career of Robert Vaughn; also his character at the end is the hero. Um didn't he brutally kill some people in the beginning?Also his relation to the character of Steve is quite idiotic. The acting here is quite bad and at times the actors sort of mumble their lines. You might have to rewind a bit so you know what they said. But I suppose it doesn't really matter since nothing they say or do for that matter is worth rewinding for.The gore here is also rather tame. Killing Birds has maybe one or two decent gore scenes.Even though this movie is called Zombie 5: Killing Birds it actually came out before Zombie 3 & 4.A lot of Italian movies are billed as sequels even I they really aren't. So I'm not sure if Media-Blasters through on the Zombie 5 or if that was just one of the alternate titles, which like I said is very common with Italian horror flicks.Killing Birds is just an idiotic movie, all we get is a bunch of idiots doing nothing interesting than just throw some zombies in there.Sorry Joe you tried, but it just wasn't working this time.For those who plan to buy this I suggest you order the Zombie Pack. You get this movie plus Zombie 3 & 4. The price for the set is cheaper than any of the movies on their own.As I said Killing Birds is quite bad, but when you think back you'll get a good laugh, but won't be in a rush to see it again.

747512,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,B00008V2UT,Jeffrey Leach,"[7, 8]","You simply must hand it to the late Joe D'Amato. During his long career in the Italian film business, good old Joe made dozens and dozens of low budget films in genres ranging from pornography to graphic exploitation to extreme horror. ""Emanuelle in America"" is a Joe D'Amato production, as is ""Anthropophagous,"" ""Buio Omega,"" ""Ator,"" and the best ""so bad it's good"" film ever made, ""Troll 2."" Sure, Joe made a lot of clinkers in his time, but what do you expect? D'Amato's films weren't crafted to win Hollywood awards. Most of his movies raked in the bucks in overseas markets, in places where the crowds filling the theater could care less about what type of schlock they're watching. A few of his movies surprisingly appeared on movie screens here in the States; I saw ""Ator"" at the local cinema in the early 1980s. Moreover, and probably most importantly, Joe's films also made money in America when the videocassette craze broke in the early 1980s. Yep, Joe D'Amato is a beloved figure to fans of schlock cinema, horror cinema, exploitation cinema, and anyone else who loves movies that wander far off the beaten path.I should start by saying ""Killing Birds"" isn't a very good film. In fact, it is at times an atrocious piece of junk best relegated to the trash heap of bad cinema. ""Killing Birds"" as a Joe D'Amato film is closer to ""Troll 2"" than it is to ""Buio Omega,"" with important exceptions. Where ""Troll 2"" was hilarious because of its badness, ""Killing Birds"" is decidedly bad in an unfunny way. Imagine, if you will, a story about a Vietnam veteran who returns to his house in the bayous of Louisiana only to find his wife cheating on him with another man. Enraged by this blatant infidelity, the vet goes on a bloody rampage. He kills his wife, her lover, and a couple of neighbors unfortunate enough to appear on the scene. The murderer does, however, spare the couple's young son. For some reason that I still cannot adequately explain, some birds living on the grounds viciously attack the vet, tearing his eyeball out of his head and thus leaving him crippled for life. All of these scenes unfold against the backdrop of lush foliage in one of those stately old mansions you often see in shows about the South. Sounds like a great premise for a horror film, doesn't it? That's what I thought. I was wrong.Flash forward twenty years or so to a college campus where a gaggle of young adults plan an expedition into the bayou to research a biology project, something about the mating call of a rare bird. The group consists of your usual young people in a horror movie. There are a few loudmouths, the scholarly chick, the oversexed cutie, and a few other stock characters. You get the idea. After heading into the wilds of Louisiana, the kids meet a blind guy (Robert Vaughn!) who lives in a rotting mansion. This man spends his days recording the sounds of the wildlife in the area, so he gives the kiddies a few tips about what they seek and then promptly disappears for a large part of the film. Too bad, by the way, because Vaughn is about the only good thing about ""Killing Birds."" Even in the short time he appears onscreen he gets all the best lines, does a competent job with a bad script, and even manages to look and act creepy. Anyway, the young adults head out into the bayou, set up base in an abandoned house, and promptly die in cheesy ways as a host of weird zombies appear on the scene. It's all really lame in the strictest sense of the word, with cheap looking gore effects, bad acting, and dumb dialogue. The movie doesn't end as much as it skids to a halt.Most of the elements we take for granted in other films fail to materialize in this one. The pacing of ""Killing Birds"" is glacial, a molasses like mess that moves with all the speed of a snail on tranquilizers. I didn't just glance at my watch once in awhile with this turkey; I looked at my timepiece so often I developed a serious case of whiplash. I would like to tell you the pacing was the worst part of the film. It's not. Check out the music for this mess. Never, in all my years of watching bad films, have I seen such a schizophrenic score. The scenes at the beginning of the movie, when we meet the kids, employs an interesting (cough) blend of bland pop music that you must simply hear to believe. Pure treacle of the most abysmal sort, like ""Dreamweaver"" but worse to the nth degree. Then, an abrupt change takes place. Maybe D'Amato dug up Jan Hammer to score most of the film because what we hear when the researchers encounter the zombies sounds a lot like ""Miami Vice."" I'm not even going to go into some of the outfits the guys wear in the film. Let's just say I had serious questions about their sexuality. I wonder why the girls in the group didn't have the same thought.I can't give ""Killing Birds"" one star, though. The movie did manage to dredge up some creepy atmosphere in the end, and Robert Vaughn's appearance helped salvage the film. The DVD version is your typical Media Blasters/Shriek Cinema disc: trailers for several other schlock classics, an extended interview with Robert Vaughn about his role in the movie (!), and some other stuff. I cannot recommend this movie without feeling guilty, and I certainly cannot do so to viewers unaccustomed to cheesy movies. Horror fans should steel themselves for an unpleasant experience before popping this one in the DVD player. All others need to stay away.

747513,A2Q5K1G3S8RLWX,B00008V2UT,"Lunar Strain ""Thrash, don't mind if I do""","[11, 13]","First off I will say this is NOT a film that is part of the Italian ""Zombie"" franchise. It was originally released in the United States as ""Killing Birds"" and the film on the DVD itself portrays this title. Shriek Show/Media Blasters Entertainment slapped the title ""Zombie 5"" on the box art to fool people into thinking this is a fifth entry into the series so they would sell more copies. Zombi 3 & 4 were both released in 1988 but Killing Birds was released in 1987...uh that doesn't make sense. Very deceptive indeed. What's next? Is Black Demons going to have the title Suspiria 2: Black Demons scrawled on the box!Now with that out of the way, let's review the Killing Birds movie itself. Killing Birds was made when the Italian horror market was starting to die off. Many of the genre's worst films were released in this time period of the late 80's and the really early 90's. The genre greats like Lucio Fulci and Dario Argento were showing signs of decline. Even with all the other bad Italian films released during this period, Killing Birds comes out as being one of the worst. This film by Joe D'Amato was filmed in the United States with American Actors so it isn't dubbed like most Italian efforts. The movie however does start off promising as it has a Vietnam vet returning home only to find his wife and lover in bed together. He murders them and her parents that happen to pull up during the incident. While cleaning up the mess in the family Avery, the killer gets his eyes gouged out by one of the family birds. Other than poor gore effects, the scene was done well and the sequence is very Italian. Right after that moment the film takes a huge nosedive as it introduces us to a handful of college students (who can't act) on a campus that apparently are majoring in some ""Bird"" like degree. They get a grant to go find some rare bird which happens to reside near the house where the first four murders took place. They run into a blind Robert Vaughn who is wearing some dreadful prosthetic makeup over his eyes. I have always liked Robert Vaughn as he can usually make bad B-Movies bearable. Sadly he isn't able to here and his character is severely underused. While in the house, the students begin to encounter weird happenings and suddenly two stiff zombies appear. The zombies (who always appear with a very fake ""White Light"" behind them) come out every so often to kill off the students one by one. Towards the end when only two students remain, Vaughn appears again saying ""It's me they want"".A lot of Italian films sacrifice cohesion of story for style but they are still great. Killing Birds however is very incoherent with no style. Who are these two zombies? Are they two of the people who were killed in the beginning? If so, why are they killing off students that had nothing to do with their murder? Are they vengeful spirits like in ""The Grudge"" who kill everyone who enters the house? Who knows as nothing is ever explained. Even the title ""Killing Birds"" is deceptive. That title and the rather cool cover art make you think this is going to be an Italian variation of Alfred Hitchcock's ""The Birds"", which it is not. The beginning has the murderer get his eyes gouged out by a bird, but he wasn't killed. The ending (Spoiler alert) has a badly matted shot of birds flying in the air applied over a shot of a house and with a scream we can safely assume the birds killed Robert Vaughn's character. Ok...these Killer (not killing) birds killed one person! And again, what is the connection between the birds and the zombies? grrrr....this film is just so mind numbing! Yes it's bad but is it so bad it's good? Frankly no. Sometimes these Italian films are so bad they are hilarious. Zombi 3 and After Death (aka Zombi 4) are so bad they are funny and entertaining as hell, but Killing Birds is not.On the up side, the DVD content is good. We get trailers and an interview with Robert Vaughn. The DVD artwork is great (other than the dismal ""Zombie 5"" tagged at the top) and Media Blasters did a fine job at remastering this dismal film. If you HAVE to see this movie and you haven't already purchased Zombi 3 and Zombie 4: After Death, then get the Zombie Pack box set as it is real cheap and then you can consider this movie as a ""bonus"".",1,"This my friend, is no zombie movie",1066780800,"10 22, 2003",2003,4277,"['First', 'off', 'will', 'say', 'NOT', 'film', 'part', 'Italian', 'Zombie', 'franchise', 'was', 'originally', 'released', 'United', 'States', 'Killing', 'Birds', 'film', 'DVD', 'title', 'Shriek', 'Show/Media', 'Blasters', 'Entertainment', 'slapped', 'title', 'Zombie', '5', 'box', 'art', 'fool', 'people', 'thinking', 'fifth', 'entry', 'series', 'would', 'sell', 'more', 'copies', 'Zombi', '3', '4', 'were', 'released', '1988', 'Killing', 'Birds', 'was', 'released', '1987', 'uh', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'Very', 'deceptive', 'indeed', 'What', 'next', 'Black', 'Demons', 'going', 'have', 'title', 'Suspiria', '2', 'Black', 'Demons', 'scrawled', 'box', 'Now', 'way', 'let', 'review', 'Killing', 'Birds', 'movie', 'Killing', 'Birds', 'was', 'made', 'when', 'Italian', 'horror', 'market', 'was', 'starting', 'die', 'off', 'Many', 'genre', 'worst', 'films', 'were', 'released', 'time', 'period', 'late', '80', 'really', 'early', '90', 'genre', 'greats', 'Lucio', 'Fulci', 'Dario', 'Argento', 'were', 'showing', 'signs', 'decline', 'Even', 'other', 'bad', 'Italian', 'films', 'released', 'period', 'Killing', 'Birds', 'out', 'being', 'one', 'worst', 'film', 'Joe', ""D'Amato"", 'was', 'filmed', 'United', 'States', 'American', 'Actors', ""n't"", 'dubbed', 'most', 'Italian', 'efforts', 'movie', 'however', 'start', 'off', 'promising', 'Vietnam', 'vet', 'returning', 'home', 'only', 'find', 'wife', 'lover', 'bed', 'together', 'parents', 'happen', 'pull', 'up', 'incident', 'cleaning', 'up', 'mess', 'family', 'Avery', 'killer', 'eyes', 'gouged', 'out', 'one', 'family', 'birds', 'Other', 'poor', 'gore', 'effects', 'scene', 'was', 'done', 'well', 'sequence', 'very', 'Italian', 'Right', 'moment', 'film', 'huge', 'nosedive', 'handful', 'college', 'students', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'campus', 'apparently', 'are', 'majoring', 'Bird', 'degree', 'get', 'grant', 'go', 'find', 'rare', 'bird', 'reside', 'house', 'where', 'first', 'four', 'murders', 'took', 'place', 'run', 'blind', 'Robert', 'Vaughn', 'who', 'wearing', 'dreadful', 'prosthetic', 'makeup', 'eyes', 'have', 'always', 'liked', 'Robert', 'Vaughn', 'can', 'usually', 'make', 'bad', 'B-Movies', 'bearable', 'Sadly', ""n't"", 'able', 'here', 'character', 'severely', 'underused', 'house', 'students', 'begin', 'encounter', 'weird', 'happenings', 'suddenly', 'two', 'stiff', 'zombies', 'appear', 'zombies', 'who', 'always', 'appear', 'very', 'fake', 'White', 'Light', 'come', 'out', 'so', 'often', 'kill', 'off', 'students', 'one', 'one', 'Towards', 'end', 'when', 'only', 'two', 'students', 'remain', 'Vaughn', 'again', 'saying', 'want', '.A', 'lot', 'Italian', 'films', 'sacrifice', 'cohesion', 'story', 'style', 'are', 'still', 'great', 'Killing', 'Birds', 'however', 'very', 'incoherent', 'style', 'Who', 'are', 'two', 'zombies', 'Are', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'killed', 'beginning', 'so', 'why', 'are', 'killing', 'off', 'students', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'murder', 'Are', 'vengeful', 'spirits', 'Grudge', 'who', 'kill', 'everyone', 'who', 'house', 'Who', 'nothing', 'ever', 'explained', 'Even', 'title', 'Killing', 'Birds', 'deceptive', 'title', 'rather', 'cool', 'cover', 'art', 'make', 'think', 'going', 'be', 'Italian', 'variation', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'Birds', 'not', 'beginning', 'murderer', 'get', 'eyes', 'gouged', 'out', 'bird', 'was', ""n't"", 'killed', 'ending', 'Spoiler', 'alert', 'badly', 'matted', 'shot', 'birds', 'flying', 'air', 'applied', 'shot', 'house', 'scream', 'can', 'safely', 'assume', 'birds', 'killed', 'Robert', 'Vaughn', 'character', 'Killer', 'not', 'killing', 'birds', 'killed', 'one', 'person', 'again', 'what', 'connection', 'birds', 'zombies', 'grrrr', '.this', 'film', 'just', 'so', 'mind', 'numbing', 'Yes', 'bad', 'so', 'bad', 'good', 'Frankly', 'Sometimes', 'Italian', 'films', 'are', 'so', 'bad', 'are', 'hilarious', '3', 'Death', 'aka', 'Zombi', '4', 'are', 'so', 'bad', 'are', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'hell', 'Killing', 'Birds', 'not.On', 'up', 'side', 'DVD', 'content', 'good', 'get', 'trailers', 'interview', 'Robert', 'Vaughn', 'DVD', 'artwork', 'great', 'other', 'dismal', 'Zombie', '5', 'tagged', 'top', 'Media', 'Blasters', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'remastering', 'dismal', 'film', 'HAVE', 'see', 'movie', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'purchased', 'Zombi', '3', 'Zombie', '4', 'Death', 'then', 'get', 'Zombie', 'Pack', 'box', 'set', 'real', 'cheap', 'then', 'can', 'consider', 'movie', 'bonus']",Zombie 5: Killing Birds
747514,ADTUS88NFTW23,B00008V2UT,"Melkor ""dark lord""","[4, 5]","I like bad movies.  I like really bad movies.  Some movies like ""Zombie 3"" are so bad that they end up being good in a comedic way.  Some movies, like ""Zombie 5: Killing Birds"", are so bad that they're not even fun.This is a case of false advertising.  First, the ""Zombie"" part of the title.  The first ""zombie"", if that's what you can call it, appears 45 minutes into the movie, and that one is only a dream, or vision, or something.  The first zombie attack happens about 50 minutes into the movie.  The second one about 69 minutes into the move, and that's about it.  Under closer examination, the creatures aren't even zombies.  Yeah, they're walking dead, but these are not the George Romero variety, which is something that even ""Zombie 4"" got kind-of right.  They're more like ghosts, and really bad ones at that.O.k., well maybe they just slapped the ""Zombie"" name on a movie that was really titled ""Killing Birds"" so they could sell it.  Do you want to hear about these killer birds?  The cover of the DVD shows the first bird attack that happens about three minutes into the movie.  The second bird attack (which they don't even show) happens right before the closing credits roll.  That's it.  There are no killing birds in this movie.So, what happens in the first 50 minutes of this movie?  Nothing.  Absolutely nothing.

747515,A3OTSL449WSX64,B00008V2UT,"Michael E. Mitchell ""a Son of Lugosi""","[0, 0]","From the other reviewers, you get the idea of what the ""story"" is about.  Let me add emphatically that said ""story"" can be observed from the perspective of great amusement...or perplexed boredom.  Starts out OK, until the throat-slitting scene appears with a beyond-cheap make-up appliance that appears on a few other throats in the course of the film(but some may not notice as it isn't always on the same side of the throat...but observe closely, I'll swear on a stack of Marduk albums that it is INDEED the exact same appliance throughout!)  We've all seen ultra-cheap special effects before (hopefully you have, if not you should never even consider uttering the words ""Zombie 5""!)...my problem is this: it was already 1987, not 1897.  ANY kid who has toyed around with fake blood could easily produce a more convincing(and gruesome) throat-slitting effect than this; if Joe D'Amato had anything to do with approving this effect, he should be dug up and....well, he'd probably like that.  ANYWAY, after the hokey slaughter-fest of the first few minutes (laughed hard when the hapless neighbors just happened to show up at the perfect time to witness and experience human butchery IN PERSON!...also the birds ripping out the eye---I only saw one being ripped out---was an pretty good effect...probably not done by the same kindergartner who was responsible for the throat effects!), the ""plot"" of the movie develops, with some oddly blase' main characters/victims.  The only real obvious stereotype shared with other films of that vintage is the guy who was obsessed with wearing headphones and bopping his head to (thankfully) inaudible and no-doubt EXCELLENT music; think the obnoxious half-shirt dork in ""Jason Lives"", but nowhere near that annoying.  The rest are just pretty lacking in personality (though there is a busdriver who demonstrates a bit of rampant libido, but not nearly up to the period's standards).  Yes, I did laugh hard at most of their clothes (though some look pretty normal); lotsa ""Miami Vice"" pastel (yellow pants, buddy? hmmmm...), and really weird pants on some of the girls, which I find hard to believe were ever a fad that women thought they looked good in!  Unfortunately, no REALLY ridiculous hair (which always adds to the fun).  Bad film fans may enjoy the lack of acting skill...for about 13 minutes.  After that, it does become tedious because it IS so dreadful!  And, yes, there are way too many scenes of idiots searching for other idiots, calling each others' names.  Put yourself in a director or editor's shoes: can you imagine EVER having the notion that this is a good, suspense-building technique?  Robert Vaughn does elevate this briefly, with his odd menacing presence; fun thing to watch for: his first appearance has ""hideous"" make up over his eyes, after which he dons shades.  Subsequent appearances don't bother with the make-up...after all, he's wearing shades!  Mr. Vaughn doesn't appear with enough frequency to save this wreck, though. I will go on record saying that the zombies seen briefly are utterly unexplained (one can speculate that they are the victims from the beginning of the film, or one can speculate that they just happened to be in Louisiana for Mardi Gras...or that, since this IS Louisiana, just happened to wander over from some other super-evil voodoo ritual).  We don't really get a good look at them, which probably lends itself to their slight effectiveness, but they look ""ok""; I've seen much worse.  And the ""unknown corpse"" the vapid main characters discover looks pretty good, too.  The reason these dopes get stuck in this slaughter-house is because they lose their ""camper""...which, oddly, is actually a van.  SPOILER ALERT!!! the ""camper"" turns out to be almost within sight of the house.  But before all this, we get to develop a ""relationship"" with these characters as we watch them in their fascinating bird-watching (and scientific recording of) techniques, INCLUDING a ""beautiful, pastoral"" song that begins with the bus driver playing the harmonica, resulting in winning smiles and head-bobbing from the appreciative companions, while bird-watching ensues.  WHAT?????  There is an atmosphere of shadowy dread that almost builds, but is constantly shattered by the utter dullness and stupidity of the characters AND the ""film-makers"".  I DID appreciate the few goofy things that did occur, and some of the corpses, and SPOILER ALERT!!! trying to guess EXACTLY when the clodhopper with the dangling compass amulet was going to get it caught on/in something that would ultimately prove unhealthy.  OH, and I forgot to mention that one of these ornithological oafs is also a proto-laptop geek, who prompts one of the only realistic lines in the film: while running from/barricading against zombies, the surviving group is urged to wait while geeky-boy revs up his clunky laptop, because ""it might know what to do"", to which a character responds in a frighteningly ALMOST LIKE REAL LIFE MANNER ""I don't need that to tell me exactly what our chances are""(or something along those lines), in an attack of what could almost have been called acting!  On the technical end, the audio was very shrill/trebly, though there is a low-end present, too, mostly in the weirdly incongruous soundtrack (the dialogue is sometimes difficult to hear, probably more likely due to poor film-making skills!), but the picture is very good.  Not recommended for ALL fans of ultra-bad cinema (it does fall flat and is mostly unendurable, though has a few rewarding parts), but if you wanna pick it up, I highly suggest you follow the other reviews' advice and get it in the ""Zombie Pack"".  Could be fun to sit around with your fiends and heckle at, IF you were all drunk on ripple.

747516,A1RHM4JTUYXKSG,B00008V2UT,"Michael Noga ""Jumping kings and making Haste ...","[1, 1]","ZOMBIE 5: KILLING BIRDS-Robert Vaughn (yeah, Napoleon Solo himself) must have really needed plastic surgery money to have taken this job. A soldier returns home after Viet Nam, sees his wife in bed with another dude and goes a little bit nuts, killing wife, the other guy, family , friends and everyone he can get his hands on except his infant son, who is given up for adoption. 20 years later the now adult son is making a documentary about an endangered Louisiana bird and so visits a Dr. Fred Brown, ornithologist and DUM DUM DUM..... his real father! (The crazy murderous loon who now studies loons,)He brings an annoying film crew with him and at some point for some reason zombies attack! They were the re-animated bodies of the people Dr. Brown killed all those years ago!I think one reason people dislike this movie is that the title is fairly misleading. The monsters aren't the usual Hollywood zombie. They aren't the Modern Zombie ala Dawn of the Dead, nor are the they Classic Zombie, as seen in old movies like White Zombie; I Walked with a Zombie or even Zombies on Broadway. They are more like vengeful spirits who have taken on fleshy form to exact their terrible revenge against the guy who horribly murdered them all those years ago, In that regard it reminds me of the Barbara Steele treat, ""Terror-Creatures from the Grave"". The monsters in Terror Creatures were plague victims, intentionally infected, who eventually rise from the grave and avenge themselves against the descendent of the rotten louse that infected and then buried them under his castle.There is a lot of cheesy acting and dialogue. The gore effects are few but reasonably well done.If you are looking for standard zombie action as we know it today then you might want to give this one a pass. It won't satisfy that appetite for gore. But if you'd like to try something a little offbeat, a little downbeat and containing  about a wheel and a half of Italian genre cheese, then you might want to look into this film.

Now, as much as I adore Zombi 2--it's on my list of the best movies ever made--I recognize that it is almost painfully cheesy. To me, that just adds to the charm. I expected the following films to be at best pale imitations of the quality of Zombi 2, and the trailers steeled me for these being bad, bad movies. And yet still I found myself stunned when I popped in Killing Birds (also known, entirely inaccurately, as Zombie 5: Killing Birds). This is a movie that not only suffers from mismarketing of the highest order, but is also well beyond painfully bad and into the category of mind-shatteringly awful. I should also note that I have a deep and abiding fondness for truly bad movies; I've seen Shriek of the Mutilated more times than I can count, and Kingdom of the Spiders has been a favorite of mine for decades. But Killing Birds doesn't have the level of cheesiness that would allow me to put it on a shelf with movies like that; it's a Z-grade giallo that someone decided to throw a couple of zombies into to try and attract a crossover market. And those killing birds? Oh, don't get me started on those killing birds.The plot involves a baby who was kidnapped from a house twenty years previous by a mysterious killer in an army jacket who dispatches the mom, dad, and two random people who just had sex. Fast-forward to the present day (well, 1987), and a group of college kids, aided by an old, blind retired professor (is that really Robert Vaughn? Did he need the money that much?), go off to hunt for a rare bird, and stumble upon the house where the murders happened. I'm quite sure you can guess what the big plot twist is. And yeah, a zombie appears about an hour into the movie, and I assume he's got a pal (because there's one scene where there have to be at least two zombies involved), but the zombie connection here is tenuous at best.The best part of this movie is Robert Vaughn's eye makeup; he supposedly had his eyes torn out by birds years before. It's not that the make-up effects are all that great (even in 1987, you'd already seen much better in Italian cinema), but that it changes every scene. There are a couple of side shots when he's wearing the dark glasses when you can tell they just didn't bother with make-up that day at all. Awesome. And no, I'm not being sarcastic--that really is the best part of the movie. The dubbing is lackluster at best, the script is a dog's dinner, the acting is bad, bad, bad. Claudio Lattanzi (later a directorial assistant on Soavi's La Chiesa, an infinitely superior film) is credited as director here, but it all starts to make sense when you realize the controlling directorial hand was that of Joe D'Amato, who made every Emmanuelle movie that's just plain awful. (In fact, he made over two hundred films, and of those I've seen, only one--1980's Anthropophagous--has actually been worth watching.)A horrible, horrible piece of work, though (by a hair) not the worst movie I've seen this week.
