265507,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,6301777387,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[3, 8]","""M.A.S.H."", both successful on the big screen and its many years performing in our smaller living rooms, is an ensemble film that uses surgery, comedy, drama, fear, and football to finally tell its off-the-map story.  There is no denying that Altman's film was funny - it was a comedy - but where it failed here yet succeeded in the smaller screen was the cohesiveness of the story and the development of our central characters.  In small thirty-minute segments, we learn more about our ""M.A.S.H."" in habitants than throughout the nearly two hours in the film.  From Donald Sutherland, to Eliot Gould, to even Robert Duvall, Altman's film never quite left the ground.  The story (or at least the little vignettes of it) were simple, the characters could have been multi-dimensional (yet simple), and the environment could have added to that overwhelming need for comedy, but instead Altman did nothing to connect these simple ideas.  Perhaps it was pioneering to see surgeons during the Korean War at work, but it added nothing to the overall film - no comedy, no insight, no charm - just a way to prove to the viewers that these men were actually men of medicine.  This was a cheap ploy that Altman did not use wisely.  ""M.A.S.H."" had all the inner-workings of a great comedy, the scene was set, and the overhead announce had his funny lines, but, sadly, this film never quite found its stride.  From the actors to the continuity to the muddled themes, ""M.A.S.H."" was genuine for its time, but watching it now, in 2008, it feels dated and overwhelmingly tiresome.What a treat it was to see the groundlings of such great actors like Donald Sutherland, Eliot Gould, Robert Duvall, and even Tom Skerritt.  To see these infamous character actors in their youthful prime is worth one star already, but that may be it.  We cannot fault Altman for not giving these characters souls, because they did.  Hawkeye had his whistle and martini, Gould had his brutal honesty, and well, Frank had his religion and his ""Hot Lips"", but alas, our guys never took them further.  These characters were strong in their individual moments, such as when Hawkeye is borrowing the Jeep at the beginning of the film, but, like the others, he suddenly falls flat and uncharismatic throughout the rest of the film.  Duvall's Frank was another character that could have been a staple through the rest of the film, but again, just jumped without reason and walked off the screen.  While we were not hoping for other war films just to be reinvented, we were hoping for some form of structure with our characters that would allow us to see their growth, see their souls, and give us a reason to follow them into the operating room or, oddly, onto the football field.  They had jokes that would make us laugh, words that would inspire, and goofiness that would only befit Altman, but there was something desperately lacking with our guy near the front line.  Sutherland was fun, but as I watched, he was Donald Sutherland in a G.I. outfit.  It was Duvall pre-""The Apostle"".  It was Tom Skerritt being, well, Tom Skerritt.  This was the ultimate shortfall for this cast.  They could not shake their own personalities - their own selves for these roles.  Concluding with this feeble football game that came from nowhere (supposedly fitting in with the tangents of war), that gave us no emotional throwback for these characters - we were left with shells of what could have been.  This was a good movie, maybe lower than good, but greatness was in an earshot if only these fine actors would have tried.Aside from the actors, the story itself seemed a failure from the beginning.  Not knowing the original ""theme song"" to this film, the ""suicide"" song set the wrong tone for the beginning of this film.  Sure, the morbid nature seemed to fit with what was happening in the operating room, but during the off chance that we knew what was happening in there, it just didn't seem to fit.  Then, when the dentist has his moment of sanity, we are returned to that same song.  It felt like one big clich&eacute; that Altman didn't want to acknowledge.  While the television music could not be shaken from my mind, this little ditty needed to be erased completely.  Aside from the song, mentioned before, there was just no story to this Korean caper.  ""M.A.S.H."" would have been a stronger outing as smaller stories within one connecting story instead of trying to just keep it all continuous.  At one moment we are listening to Hot Lips and Frank, in another we are fighting for a Korean boy to not join his national army, and then to wrap it up, we are playing in a clich&eacute; football match-up with an outcome everyone expected.  It felt like Altman had the ideas; he just didn't know how to connect them all cohesively.  The thought probably being that he could connect them through the surgery room banter was not worth the printed reel, while the guy doing the announcements at camp was not a close enough second place.  I wanted to like the quirkiness of the characters; I wanted to see the juxtaposition of the tragedy of the war, with the comedy of the doctors.  I wanted to see Sutherland use humor to alleviate the blood of war - alas - this never happened.  I chuckled once during the big Hot Lips shower scene, and that was it.  There was a level of brevity with Altman's war-torn camp, but at times it felt more along the lines of apathy.  Nobody cared, nobody had heart, nobody showed emotion except for Frank, and he was less than a secondary character.  What was needed to make ""M.A.S.H."" a stand out film was a big emotional element or characters with flaws, not the cheapened suicide song coupled with sexual escapades.  It just didn't work.Overall, I cannot say that I was impressed with the praise that Altman has received for this film.  ""M.A.S.H."" may have been a pioneering film for the time, but over the years it has become more and more chaotic, and less meaningful.  Altman's control over his characters and story is non-existent, as he just added short story over non-connective short story in hopes to make at least a two-hour long feature film.  Add in Sutherland's semi-annoying whistle, and we have monumental film that seemed avante-guard for the time, but now just feel misleading.  Remember, this was pre-""M.A.S.H."" the television show, which was a defined comedy/drama show.  Looking back at the film, it did work in simple 30 minute segments, so perhaps Altman was thinking television while he made this - that would make stronger sense for the continuity issue.  Either way, ""M.A.S.H."", with the cast and director had bigger hopes in my eyes, but was let down in the long run.  Time has nearly corrupted this film, and even with our current war standings - it just doesn't relate.Grade: ** out of *****",2,M.A.S.H. the TV Series ... Great.

I had looked at Amazon's special offers of the box set but was put off by the reviews regarding the packaging and how it damaged the disks. When Amazon put this collection - the individual boxed set up for a deal of the day I snatched it up, and have no regrets in doing so.I watched MASH when it was originally released when I was young living in England. It was a show that aired on BBC2 at 9.00pm and because I was younger I did not get all of the jokes, but did enjoy the show. I stopped watching MASH after several seasons when the BBC decided to include the laughter track on its broadcasts. I hated the laughter track, the show is funny enough so we don't need these cues of when to laugh. When I heard the DVD release has the option to turn off the canned laughter I rejoiced.So far I have watched season 1 on the DVD set and I am loving this trip back to my youth, the humor on this show works even better not. Although the quality is not fantastic and is in 4:3 aspect ratio, it is a sign of the times this show was released. The added bonus is that this set comes with the movie too, my wife (who is American born and bred) did not even know there was a movie and so we enjoyed this together with many a lol!I would recommend this individually boxed set of MASH, especially if you can get it on the deal of the day!",5,Fantastic,1377648000,"08 28, 2013",2013,1411,"['have', 'been', 'looking', 'add', 'complete', 'MASH', 'series', 'm', 'y', 'collection', 'time', 'had', 'looked', 'Amazon', 'special', 'offers', 'box', 'set', 'was', 'put', 'off', 'reviews', 'regarding', 'packaging', 'how', 'damaged', 'disks', 'When', 'Amazon', 'put', 'collection', 'individual', 'boxed', 'set', 'up', 'deal', 'day', 'snatched', 'up', 'have', 'regrets', 'doing', 'so.I', 'watched', 'MASH', 'when', 'was', 'originally', 'released', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'living', 'England', 'was', 'show', 'aired', 'BBC2', '9.00pm', 'was', 'younger', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'jokes', 'did', 'enjoy', 'show', 'stopped', 'watching', 'MASH', 'several', 'seasons', 'when', 'BBC', 'decided', 'include', 'laughter', 'track', 'broadcasts', 'hated', 'laughter', 'track', 'show', 'funny', 'enough', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'cues', 'when', 'laugh', 'When', 'heard', 'DVD', 'release', 'option', 'turn', 'off', 'canned', 'laughter', 'rejoiced.So', 'far', 'have', 'watched', 'season', '1', 'DVD', 'set', 'am', 'loving', 'trip', 'back', 'youth', 'humor', 'show', 'even', 'better', 'not', 'quality', 'not', 'fantastic', '4:3', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'sign', 'times', 'show', 'was', 'released', 'added', 'bonus', 'set', 'movie', 'too', 'wife', 'who', 'American', 'born', 'bred', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'know', 'was', 'movie', 'so', 'enjoyed', 'together', 'many', 'lol', 'would', 'recommend', 'individually', 'boxed', 'set', 'MASH', 'especially', 'can', 'get', 'deal', 'day']",M*A*S*H VHS

This comic and absurdist film captured and helped form the blithe irreverence of the 60's counterculture.

Its spirit is caught perfectly in one short take.

A couple of his films that have withheld the test of time, Nashville and California Split, come readily to mind. Those slice of life films still ""speak"" to the subjects at hand, the glitter of country music stardom and its underside reality and the fight to get rich quick at the gambling tables. No so this film, M.A.S.H., a film that on first viewing I was very impressed with. On a recent re-viewing I found myself distracted most of the time. Not that the film's ""follies of war"" theme in a front-line Army medical unit (then the Vietnam War, although the earlier Korean War is the thinly-veiled locale of the film, and not to be confused with the handful of American wars since then) has lost its significance. If anything that theme is more relevant that ever. What has lost power, and punch, is the notion that through the antics, and frankly this thing is filled with antics, that would embarrass even the lowliest ""frat rat"", can draw those lessons about the folly of war. Sex, sacrifice, more sex, some off-hand skilled surgery, more hi-jinks and booze, and then off to home (and presumably a soft, country club life) do not make that same impression that first drew me to the film.

They have done their best there, and I can report to you without reservation that they are splendid in every way.I now close my military career and just fade away, an old soldier who tried to do his duty as God gave him the light to see that duty. Goodbye"" -- Gen. Douglas MacArthurThis is the Korean War (1950-1953). We are visiting and passionate on the front line and observing the many lives of the very people that make the M*A*S*H (The 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital) unit possible. This film is touted as a thinly veiled Vietnam War satire.Some great one-liners as ""You forgot your shingle doctor ""as he holds up a piece of toast with creamed chipped beef on it. Or as Frank Burns is being hauled off in a straight jacket, the loud speaker is playing ""it's time to say sayonara"" May military inside jokes and even the clich&eacute;s have a basis in reality.  Although this film takes place, in Korea, it draws a very close parallel to the environment I was in Vietnam and I suspect there have been other wars with other environments similar and may again in the future. It's the laughs that we clean out of these types of films that make those situations tolerable.For many movies especially older ones Blu-Ray is really just a gimmick and does not really add to or subtract from the storyline or the acting itself. However occasionally the visuals and sounds of Blu-Ray can contribute to earlier movies that were designed before Blu-Ray was conceived; this is one of those movies.

Upon repeated viewings it began to grow on me and over the years has become one of my favorite films. In fact, I bought a laserdisc player in 1995 just to be able to own a widescreen copy of it. Seeing it in widscreen was like seeing it for the first time. Seeing it this past week on the DVD brought the same experience. Both picture and sound restoration are simply marvelous and bring a fresh appreciation to a film I have seen at least 50 times. There are plenty of extra features. I too was a little disappointed in Altman's commentary but it does not spoil the overall package. A five star film, a five star DVD set.This film ain't for everyone. It has no conventional story line and the overlapping dialogue may require reapeating viewings to pick up everything--although I still get something new everytime I see it. It's gory, sometimes mean, sometimes crude and sometimes slapstick. Drop your paradigms on movies, forget what you know and expect about film, forget the TV series, and just enjoy the experience. Give it a chance. You may hate it at first but if you are somehow drawn to it as I was, give it another chance. It just may grow on you. And one day you too may realize that Altman created one of the most brilliantly made films ever. There is nothing else like it.

The 1970 film came out at a time when the United States was being blown apart in political and social upheaval, the massacre at Kent State University erupted, and films like Patton, Tora.Tora.Tora, Kelly's Heroes, The Ballad Of Cable Hogue, The Cheynne Social Club, Start the Revolution Without Me, Beneath The Planet Of The Apes, the re-releases of 2001:A Space Odyssey and The Wild Bunch, along with the X - rated comedy Beyond The Valley Of The Dolls, were hitting the big screens all across the nation.Director Robert Altman, along with a cast that consists of Donald Sutherland, Elliott Gould, Tom Skerritt, Sally Kellerman, Rene Auberjonois, Robert Duvall, Fred Williamson, Gary Burghoff, and countless others make their mark on cinema history, with a film that really hits the subject of war on the dot.

The result could've been a royal mess, but really turned out to be inspired, kicking off a decade of cinematic innovation.

265545,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,6301777387,David Baldwin,"[3, 6]","Though I do not agree with the politics of director Robert Altman, I am a great admirer of his artistry and most of all the independence of his from the cookie-cutter style of film-making that is prevalent in Hollywood.  Though he's hit more singles than homeruns, his films are rarely un-interesting.  One of the few times that he tackled a studio product, ""Popeye"", he made it seem like an independent film.  Those not familiar with the theme of this film or the long-running TV series based on this film, it involves the hi-jinks of a group of army surgeons during the Korean War trying to cope with the horrors that surround them.  This film does not so much have a story but a series of comic vignettes (the shower scene, the football game, etc.)  These comic episodes are effectively juxtaposed with the operating room scenes that illustrate why these surgeons have to engage in such outrageous behaviour; if they weren't laughing, they'd be crying.  Altman gathers an impressive cast here, many making their film debuts.  Donald Sutherland as Hawkeye, Elliott Gould as Trapper John, and Sally Kellerman as Hotlips are effectively funny in the leading roles.  Altman gives an excellent commentary here as he has done on other DVDs.  Altman states in his comments his distaste for the TV series that spun-off from this film.

Gannon,"[1, 2]","MASH was a breakthrough movie on many fronts.It was Roger Altman's personal breakthrough movie after several years apprenticeship in TV and smaller feature film work.  It was a breakthrough for the ensemble film format.  Yes, there had been successful ensemble films before this, but all were largely dependent on the ""All Star Cast"" format.  MASH represented the first major successful film, both commercially and artistically, that relied on an entirely on a relatively unknown cast.  And, finally, MASH broke through as the first major success as an anti Vietnam War vehicle to gain mass appeal.  In a way, it marked a major turning point in popular attitudes toward the Vietnam War.Set during the Korean Conflict, MASH tells the story of the 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital.  The MASH was an agglomeration of regular Army personnel and drafted civilian doctors unindoctrinated to-and often intellectually antipathetic towards, army practice and procedure and authority.The movie graphically depicts the brutality of war, though it shows no actual war scenes per se.  (The only gun fired during the entire movie is when an official shoots a pistol into the air to mark the end of the period during a football game.)  What you see is an unending string of dead and horrible wounded soldiers brought to the MASH from the front to be worked on at the hospital.  Te constant scenes of battered and maimed bodies in surgery is sufficient enough to convey the horrors of the field of battle and the inherent cruelty and inhumanity of modern warfare.One also sees the toll that is taken on the doctors and staff of the MASH unit itself.The various mad-cap antics the doctors and staff engage in to blow off steam are hilarious and immensely entertaining yet there is a dark, unsettling edge to the humor.  You know that the fact that they are surrounded by insanity of all sorts and inhumanity of all kinds leads even the doctors-so disciplined and value driven in ordinary circumstances-into acts that are ethically dubious to the extreme.  It is definitely funny-it's also somewhat sad.The resulted one of the best movies of all time and the very best antiwar movie ever made.This is a 30th anniversary edition that has been restored and contains several retrospective clips as well.

THAT IS CUSTOMER SERVICE OF THE HIGHEST ORDER!!!This is one of the greatest TV shows of all time IMHO. All the actors did their job just about as good as possible. And the writing was even better than that. The directing was superb and so was the cinematography. The show was realtively realistic in showing what the Drs and RNs went through - losing lives - saving lives - 14 - 16 or more hour days under intense pressure. Being a pharmacist myself I understand a bit of the spot they were in. I'm NOT trying to say I understand completely as even through I have been involved in life or death situtations it certainly wasn't like what they experienced.Those of you who have watched any of these will have their favorite characters - be it Hawkeye, BJ, Radar, Klinger, Col Potter, etc. This show was filled with memorable characters which allowed it to share the 'wealth' and keeps the show interesting. To me this is a key feature of this show - no one actor had to carry the entire load in each show. This kept the show fresh even if a character would die (as for Lt Col Blake) or just leave as Radar did.I don't believe I've ever seen a MASH that wasn't at the very least very, very good. You can't say that about very many shows - that they were at least extremely good. And even thro they were made 30 years ago or so about a war that was more than 50 years ago almost of the stories as still pertinent to today problems.But yet - they still managed to have fun - mostly to keep from cracking under all the pressure.I would rate this show a near perfect scores of 9.75 to 10.0 out of 10HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR NEARLY EVERYONE!",5,One of the best shows EVER!,1374624000,"07 24, 2013",2013,1728,"['1st', 'ordered', 'evening', '7/22/13', 'was', 'doorstep', '7/23/13', '6pm', 'CUSTOMER', 'SERVICE', 'THE', 'HIGHEST', 'ORDER', 'one', 'greatest', 'TV', 'shows', 'time', 'IMHO', 'actors', 'did', 'job', 'just', 'about', 'as', 'good', 'possible', 'writing', 'was', 'even', 'better', 'directing', 'was', 'superb', 'so', 'was', 'cinematography', 'show', 'was', 'realtively', 'realistic', 'showing', 'what', 'Drs', 'RNs', 'went', 'losing', 'saving', '14', '16', 'more', 'hour', 'days', 'intense', 'pressure', 'Being', 'pharmacist', 'understand', 'bit', 'spot', 'were', ""'m"", 'NOT', 'trying', 'say', 'understand', 'completely', 'even', 'have', 'been', 'involved', 'life', 'death', 'situtations', 'certainly', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'experienced.Those', 'who', 'have', 'watched', 'will', 'have', 'favorite', 'characters', 'be', 'Hawkeye', 'BJ', 'Radar', 'Klinger', 'Col', 'Potter', 'etc', 'show', 'was', 'filled', 'memorable', 'characters', 'allowed', 'share', ""'wealth"", 'show', 'interesting', 'key', 'feature', 'show', 'one', 'actor', 'had', 'carry', 'entire', 'load', 'show', 'kept', 'show', 'fresh', 'even', 'character', 'would', 'die', 'Lt', 'Col', 'Blake', 'just', 'leave', 'Radar', 'did.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'MASH', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'least', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'about', 'very', 'many', 'shows', 'were', 'least', 'extremely', 'good', 'even', 'thro', 'were', 'made', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'so', 'war', 'was', 'more', '50', 'years', 'ago', 'almost', 'stories', 'still', 'pertinent', 'today', 'problems.But', 'yet', 'still', 'managed', 'have', 'fun', 'mostly', 'keep', 'cracking', 'pressure.I', 'would', 'rate', 'show', 'near', 'perfect', 'scores', '9.75', '10.0', '10HIGHLY', 'RECOMMENDED', 'FOR', 'NEARLY', 'EVERYONE']",M*A*S*H VHS

On the one hand, you could point to ""M*A*S*H"" as an irreverent black comedy with serious political/social undertones; culmination of a sub-genre launched in the 1960s with Stanley Kubrick's pointedly satirical ""Dr. Strangelove"", and continuing with the more abstract European anti-war films ""King Of Hearts"" and ""How I Won The War"". On the other hand, you could also say that ""M*A*S*H"", with its generous helping of bawdy frat-boy sex pranks and expletive-rich insult humor (something American audiences hadn't seen much in major studio releases up to that point in time) also could have helped pave the way for the likes of ""Porky's"", ""Caddyshack"" and the ""American Pie"" franchise, i.e. the general ""dumbing down"" of Hollywood. (I have to chuckle at some of the younger reviewers making comments to the effect of: ""This movie is weird and boring-its not ANYTHING like the TV show..."" I rest my case.) ""M*A*S*H"" is the first truly ""Altmanesque"" film that Altman made- a huge cast, overlapping (and frequently improvised) dialogue, busy set pieces and a patented mix of high and low comedy. Also notable for launching the careers of Bud Cort, Tom Skeritt, Sally Kellerman, Michael Murphy, and at least a half dozen more actors whose names are credited with the phrase ""And introducing..."" The single-disc 2004 DVD version released by Fox features a sparkling widescreen transfer, decent sound and director commentary. Altman's commentary track is sporadic but worthwhile for film buffs.

From Bluray dot com comes the great description of the movie- &#34;One of the world's most acclaimed comedies, M*A*S*H focuses on three Korean War Army surgeons brilliantly brought to life by Donald Sutherland, Tom Skerritt and Elliott Gould. Though highly skilled and deeply dedicated, they adopt a hilarious, lunatic lifestyle as an antidote to the tragedies of their Mobile Army Surgical Hospital, and in the process infuriate Army bureaucrats. Robert Duvall, Gary Burghoff and Sally Kellerman co-star as a sanctimonious Major, an other-worldly corporal, and a self-righteous yet lusty nurse&#34;Now that you know what the movie is let's move on to discuss the presentation. MASH is not a movie that &#34;Pops&#34; in high definition, such as &#34;Wizard of OZ,&#34;  for much of the movie uses Army drab colors to paint the dreary life in a Korean War MASH unit. The movie is fairly clean and clear and looks good, and the football game between the MASH unit and a General's special &#34;Unit&#34; shows off the contrast between the vibrant football uniforms and the usual drabness just fine. I have to give a solid 4 out of 5 for this movie appearance, while the content gets a 4.5/5.Bobby Troup makes a cameo as a jeep driver in the scene where Hawkeye and Pierce get to go to Japan for some surgery on a congressman's son and some golf.The movie is vastly different than the TV show in some ways in that the protagonists, Hawkeye and Pierce got to leave the MASH unit at the end and return home.

(Mobile Army Surgical Hospital - Korean War).  The first 2 were high budget, Star Studded and on location.  Mash was low budget, unknown cast and filmed on the Universal Ranch.MASH became the sleeper hit of 1970 receiving 5 Oscar nominations and winning 1 (Best Screenplay).This 2 DVD disk digitally remastered Widescreen (Letterbox)set has an extensive history and background information about the Korean War, Mash Units and the people who served during these difficult times.Actually MASH was an Anti-War film against the Vietnam War, but was done very effectively to be a very Dark Comedy in a war time environment.  With the Humane Medical Teams showing the carnage of War through surgery and the horror of war and death.  The movie conveys the story, cast and war time setting very effectively so we can enjoy the black humor, sex and horror.  We get the message wihout the anti-protesters in our face.  We see how war destroys us one way or another.Summary: The 4077th M.A.S.H. Unit is stationed 3 miles form the Korean front lines.  The Cast of characters are drafted Medical Personell that find a way of serving and existing in this environment through humor, defying authority, sex and friendships.  This movie is fast paced, a highly intense drama/comedy which allows us to enter the combat front through the humanity of medicine and the miracle of life.  The cast is outstanding!You must see this movie.  It is a historical statement of 1970 and it remains a timeless classic!

MASH effectively is a commentary against war and is seemingly as somber as it is funny. However, up to the end you are left with a smile on your face. The climatic moments during the football game will have all riled up and fittingly we see Captain Pierce (Sutherland) ride away in the same stolen jeep he had when arriving.

265576,A2C7BOQVFH1HLE,6301777387,Frederick Baptist,"[2, 4]","For its time, this was an entertaining comedy with an anti-war message that was loved for its ability to express the feelings of most Americans at the time on the Vietnam War.  This is a film about the Korean War only in name but as you will see throughout, the de facto Vietnam theme is prevalent throughout sometimes subtly but even blatantly for instance in the downtown ""Korea"" scene where the women are all wearing Vietnamese-style conical hats which is not indigenous to Korea.Overall, this comedy doesn't age well for modern viewers although its anti-war message is very clear and resonates even today.  Some parts are simply boring and I especially found the whole football scene totally sleep-worthy and I didn't see how it added to the overall theme unless it's a way to show how Americans try to impose their culture on Asians with a sport that even today is struggling to find acceptance outside the U.S. and certainly within Asia.One scene that I found very powerful and which made this film at least watchable for me was the suicide scene.  The U.S. is this big superpower that everyone respects (Painless) and yet the truth is that it is insecure and needs to express its ""manhood"" to regain its potency and the way they decided to do this is to commit ""suicide"" by going to war and it takes his friends (allies) to show him the way and to stop him from going through with his plans.  In a way this movie's premise represent the allies and the Vietnam War/U.S. government is ""Painless"".  The Hotlips/Frank Burns humiliation scene is also powerful in that it exposes the hypocrisy of the U.S. government in trying to tell other nations how to live and govern themselves when it itself is inherently corrupt and filled with major problems of its own as is shown in another scene with Duke exhibiting his racist tendencies for example.Otherwise, the film is rather disjointed and comes across as a collection of anti-war skits that doesn't flow very well.  This dvd package is also disappointing as it unnecesarily puts into 2 discs what can be put onto one as the special features are not that long and the only reason I can think of why they would do this is to have the excuse to charge you more for the 2 discs.  The picture quality is slightly above VHS quality and there are still frames with white spots and other imperfections despite the heroic attempts at restoration of which they go through great pains to tell you on the second disc and in the accompanying booklet.The sound quality is okay coming in Dolby Digital THX mastered stereo although they really should have provided 5.1 surround options as well.  However, the documentary ""Enlisted: The Story of MASH"" is a gem as it relates the true life of a MASH unit in Korea and this accounts for one full star of my rating.  This movie is also important though as it started the highly successful and in my mind much better long-running television series where you get much better script writing and hence jokes than you get here.Still, this is an entertaining film that in a number of collected skits successfully shows us the futility and insanity of war.Updated on 6 June 2011:As Amazon will not allow me to review this separately, I'll have to append this here.  This blu-ray version of the film is certainly worth the double-dip as both the picture and sound qualities have improved vastly over the dvd version that I reviewed above.  While not pristine perfect the picture quality in 1080p looks a lot better than before and the sound in DTS HD MA 5.1 Surround is light years better than the dvd.  While the special feature documentaries haven't improved over the dvd on the strength of both the picture and sound quality improvements this blu-ray version of the film is worth the upgrade.Recommended!",3,Irreverent Anti-War Comedy that's Almost As Good As Catch-22!,1219536000,"08 24, 2008",2008,3782,"['time', 'was', 'entertaining', 'comedy', 'anti-war', 'message', 'was', 'loved', 'ability', 'express', 'feelings', 'most', 'Americans', 'time', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'film', 'Korean', 'War', 'only', 'name', 'will', 'see', 'de', 'facto', 'Vietnam', 'theme', 'prevalent', 'sometimes', 'subtly', 'even', 'blatantly', 'instance', 'downtown', 'Korea', 'scene', 'where', 'women', 'are', 'wearing', 'Vietnamese-style', 'conical', 'hats', 'not', 'indigenous', 'Korea.Overall', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'age', 'well', 'modern', 'viewers', 'anti-war', 'message', 'very', 'clear', 'even', 'today', 'parts', 'are', 'simply', 'boring', 'especially', 'found', 'whole', 'football', 'scene', 'totally', 'sleep-worthy', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'added', 'overall', 'theme', 'way', 'show', 'how', 'Americans', 'try', 'impose', 'culture', 'Asians', 'sport', 'even', 'today', 'struggling', 'find', 'acceptance', 'U.S.', 'certainly', 'Asia.One', 'scene', 'found', 'very', 'powerful', 'made', 'film', 'least', 'watchable', 'was', 'suicide', 'scene', 'U.S.', 'big', 'superpower', 'everyone', 'respects', 'Painless', 'yet', 'truth', 'insecure', 'express', 'manhood', 'regain', 'potency', 'way', 'decided', 'do', 'commit', 'suicide', 'going', 'war', 'friends', 'allies', 'show', 'way', 'stop', 'going', 'plans', 'way', 'movie', 'premise', 'represent', 'allies', 'Vietnam', 'War/U.S', 'government', 'Painless', 'Hotlips/Frank', 'Burns', 'humiliation', 'scene', 'also', 'powerful', 'hypocrisy', 'U.S.', 'government', 'trying', 'tell', 'other', 'nations', 'how', 'live', 'govern', 'when', 'inherently', 'corrupt', 'filled', 'major', 'problems', 'own', 'shown', 'scene', 'Duke', 'exhibiting', 'racist', 'tendencies', 'example.Otherwise', 'film', 'rather', 'disjointed', 'across', 'collection', 'anti-war', 'skits', ""n't"", 'flow', 'very', 'well', 'dvd', 'package', 'also', 'disappointing', 'unnecesarily', '2', 'discs', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'put', 'onto', 'one', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'not', 'long', 'only', 'reason', 'can', 'think', 'why', 'would', 'do', 'have', 'excuse', 'charge', 'more', '2', 'discs', 'picture', 'quality', 'slightly', 'VHS', 'quality', 'are', 'still', 'frames', 'white', 'spots', 'other', 'imperfections', 'heroic', 'attempts', 'restoration', 'go', 'great', 'pains', 'tell', 'second', 'disc', 'accompanying', 'booklet.The', 'sound', 'quality', 'okay', 'coming', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'THX', 'mastered', 'stereo', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'provided', '5.1', 'surround', 'options', 'well', 'However', 'documentary', 'Enlisted', 'Story', 'MASH', 'gem', 'true', 'life', 'MASH', 'unit', 'Korea', 'accounts', 'one', 'full', 'star', 'rating', 'movie', 'also', 'important', 'started', 'highly', 'successful', 'mind', 'much', 'better', 'long-running', 'television', 'series', 'where', 'get', 'much', 'better', 'script', 'writing', 'hence', 'jokes', 'get', 'here.Still', 'entertaining', 'film', 'number', 'collected', 'skits', 'successfully', 'futility', 'insanity', 'war.Updated', '6', 'June', '2011', 'Amazon', 'will', 'not', 'allow', 'review', 'separately', ""'ll"", 'have', 'append', 'here', 'blu-ray', 'version', 'film', 'certainly', 'worth', 'double-dip', 'picture', 'sound', 'qualities', 'have', 'improved', 'vastly', 'dvd', 'version', 'reviewed', 'not', 'pristine', 'picture', 'quality', '1080p', 'lot', 'better', 'before', 'sound', 'DTS', 'HD', 'MA', '5.1', 'Surround', 'light', 'years', 'better', 'dvd', 'special', 'feature', 'documentaries', 'have', ""n't"", 'improved', 'dvd', 'strength', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'improvements', 'blu-ray', 'version', 'film', 'upgrade.Recommended']",M*A*S*H VHS

Taylor ""GFT""","[3, 5]","Although M*A*S*H is probably his most audience-friendly film, Robert Altman's style of over-lapping dialogue and multiple themes provokes a divided reaction even in this early work: you either like it or you don't.  Perhaps more significant, however, are expectations raised by the popular and long-running television series the film inspired: the series concerned likable characters playing situation comedy with a dramatic spin, and viewers who expect to see this repeated in the film will be disappointed--and very probably outraged as well.  Like most Altman films, M*A*S*H is character-driven, and there is no plot in any traditional sense.  In general, the film concerns three surgeons (Hawkeye, Trapper, and Duke, here played by Donald Sutherland, Elliot Gould, and Tom Skerritt) who are drafted to serve in Korea.  Sharing a mutual fondness for martinis and a complete disrespect for all things military, they run riot through the M*A*S*H 4077, mocking the efforts of by-the-book military officers to make them toe the line and using the army's need of their skills to prevent higher authority from penalizing them for their antics.  Most of the characters (including the three leads) are at best unsympathetic, and the film's comic elements are deliberately grotesque, mean-spirited, blasphemous, sexist, and vulgar.Altman clearly intends us to read the Korean setting as a metaphor for Vietnam and the disrespect for an inept military authority as a metaphor for America's increasing disenchantment with military intervention in Vietnam; at the same time, the film's graphic surgery scenes provide us with a clear vision of the human toll war requires.  Because the film mixes these points of view with comic elements, it is frequently described as an anti-war black comedy--but the film is so profoundly bitter that the word comedy, even when codified as ""black,"" is rather misleading.  There are certainly comic elements and even a few laugh-out-loud moments (most centering upon Margaret ""Hotlips"" O'Houlihan, brilliantly played by Sally Kellerman), but the tone of the film is so bitter that the laughter induced is very rueful indeed. Seen today, M*A*S*H feels slightly uneven in execution and very much of its place and time--but even so the cast performs with an extremely compelling immediacy and Altman's dark and multi-layered vision makes a powerful statement.  The DVD release features a superb restoration of the film, a rather dismissable director's commentary track, and four short documentaries re the film which are extremely interesting but often redundant.  Fans of Altman in general or this film in particular will find the DVD a must-have.  While I do recommend the film to newcomers, I offer the warning that response to the film varies considerably from individual to individual.  Whatever the case, M*A*S*H was and is a landmark film that deserves a place in any serious DVD library.",5,"Ugly, Blasphemous, Vulgar, Mean-Spirited--and Brilliant",1016841600,"03 23, 2002",2002,2917,"['M*A*S*H', 'probably', 'most', 'audience-friendly', 'film', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'style', 'over-lapping', 'dialogue', 'multiple', 'themes', 'provokes', 'divided', 'reaction', 'even', 'early', 'work', 'either', 'do', ""n't"", 'Perhaps', 'more', 'significant', 'however', 'are', 'expectations', 'raised', 'popular', 'long-running', 'television', 'series', 'film', 'inspired', 'series', 'concerned', 'likable', 'characters', 'playing', 'situation', 'comedy', 'dramatic', 'spin', 'viewers', 'who', 'expect', 'see', 'repeated', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'very', 'probably', 'outraged', 'as', 'well', 'most', 'Altman', 'films', 'M*A*S*H', 'character-driven', 'plot', 'traditional', 'sense', 'general', 'film', 'concerns', 'three', 'surgeons', 'Hawkeye', 'Trapper', 'Duke', 'here', 'played', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Elliot', 'Gould', 'Tom', 'Skerritt', 'who', 'are', 'drafted', 'serve', 'Korea', 'Sharing', 'mutual', 'fondness', 'martinis', 'complete', 'disrespect', 'things', 'military', 'run', 'riot', 'M*A*S*H', '4077', 'mocking', 'efforts', 'by-the-book', 'military', 'officers', 'make', 'toe', 'line', 'using', 'army', 'need', 'skills', 'prevent', 'higher', 'authority', 'penalizing', 'antics', 'Most', 'characters', 'including', 'three', 'leads', 'are', 'best', 'unsympathetic', 'film', 'comic', 'elements', 'are', 'deliberately', 'grotesque', 'mean-spirited', 'blasphemous', 'sexist', 'vulgar.Altman', 'clearly', 'read', 'Korean', 'setting', 'metaphor', 'Vietnam', 'disrespect', 'inept', 'military', 'authority', 'metaphor', 'America', 'increasing', 'disenchantment', 'military', 'intervention', 'Vietnam', 'same', 'time', 'film', 'graphic', 'surgery', 'scenes', 'provide', 'clear', 'vision', 'human', 'toll', 'war', 'film', 'mixes', 'points', 'view', 'comic', 'elements', 'frequently', 'described', 'anti-war', 'black', 'comedy', 'film', 'so', 'profoundly', 'bitter', 'word', 'comedy', 'even', 'when', 'codified', 'black', 'rather', 'misleading', 'are', 'certainly', 'comic', 'elements', 'even', 'few', 'laugh-out-loud', 'moments', 'most', 'centering', 'Margaret', 'Hotlips', ""O'Houlihan"", 'brilliantly', 'played', 'Sally', 'Kellerman', 'tone', 'film', 'so', 'bitter', 'laughter', 'induced', 'very', 'rueful', 'indeed', 'Seen', 'today', 'M*A*S*H', 'slightly', 'uneven', 'execution', 'very', 'much', 'place', 'time', 'even', 'cast', 'performs', 'extremely', 'compelling', 'immediacy', 'Altman', 'dark', 'multi-layered', 'vision', 'powerful', 'statement', 'DVD', 'release', 'superb', 'restoration', 'film', 'rather', 'dismissable', 'director', 'commentary', 'track', 'four', 'short', 'documentaries', 're', 'film', 'are', 'extremely', 'interesting', 'often', 'redundant', 'Fans', 'Altman', 'general', 'film', 'particular', 'will', 'find', 'DVD', 'must-have', 'do', 'recommend', 'film', 'newcomers', 'offer', 'warning', 'response', 'film', 'varies', 'considerably', 'individual', 'individual', 'Whatever', 'case', 'M*A*S*H', 'was', 'landmark', 'film', 'place', 'serious', 'DVD', 'library']",M*A*S*H VHS

265587,A1N40I9TO33VDU,6301777387,Grant A Thompson,"[83, 92]","M*A*S*H is one of the zaniest and most intelligent satires ever produced by Hollywood.  This is a war movie in which only two shots are fired -- as signals in a football game.  It is a masterpiece of wider appeal -- even to veterans -- than is suggested by its setting in Korean War military hospitals, or by its director's explicit aim of promoting liberal opposition to the Vietnam war during the '60s and '70s.The 2002 two-disk M*A*S*H special edition from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment in many ways is a benchmark for DVD releases of cult movies.  Picture and sound quality are high.  The special feature content is entertaining and insightful.This content includes extensive retrospective comment by director Robert Altman, producer Ingo Preminger, former studio boss Richard Zanuck, scriptwriter Ring Lardner Jr, actors including Donald Sutherland, Elliott Gould, Sally Kellerman, Tom Skerritt, John Schuck and Gary Burghoff, and medical veterans of the Korean War.  We see the 30th anniversary M*A*S*H reunion at Fox, and presentation of a studio life achievement award to Altman.The special content gives fascinating insights into the driving half-mad genius that so often makes a great director, and of egos and bigheartedness in movie making.Almost everyone, from the scriptwriter to the studio executives and the actors, lined up against the director at some time.  Donald Sutherland and Elliott Gould once even tried to get Altman fired, fearing that he would damage their careers.  In the M*A*S*H special edition features they eat their words and graciously pay tribute to Altman.  Former studio boss Richard Zanuck says that until Altman came along other directors were afraid of the screenplay or didn't like it.  'Altman came in, and seemed unruly enough to be able to understand this subject matter.'M*A*S*H was made on a shoestring budget with Fox's Century Ranch standing in for Korea.  It emerged from chaotic creative tension as an enormous artistic and financial success.  Altman accepted a salary of only $75,000.  His son Mike is reputed to have made more money from writing the lyric to the keynote ballad, 'Suicide Is Painless', with Johnny Mandel.  Altman kept costs down by casting the movie with mostly unknown and out-of-work actors.  14 of the movie's 30 speaking roles were played by actors making their screen debut.  Shooting finished three days ahead of schedule in 1969, and almost half a million dollars under budget.  M*A*S*H went on to earn more than $80 million at the box office, a Palme d'Or at Cannes and an Oscar (for the heavily reworked script of formerly blacklisted scriptwriter Ring Lardner Jr), and to inspire a long-running popular TV series.This is a rare thing: a five star classic movie in a five star DVD release.",5,M*A*S*H - intelligent satire in a benchmark DVD release,1030147200,"08 24, 2002",2002,2774,"['M*A*S*H', 'one', 'zaniest', 'most', 'intelligent', 'satires', 'ever', 'produced', 'Hollywood', 'war', 'movie', 'only', 'two', 'shots', 'are', 'fired', 'signals', 'football', 'game', 'masterpiece', 'wider', 'appeal', 'even', 'veterans', 'suggested', 'setting', 'Korean', 'War', 'military', 'hospitals', 'director', 'explicit', 'aim', 'promoting', 'liberal', 'opposition', 'Vietnam', 'war', ""'60s"", ""'70s.The"", '2002', 'two-disk', 'M*A*S*H', 'special', 'edition', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'Home', 'Entertainment', 'many', 'ways', 'benchmark', 'DVD', 'releases', 'cult', 'movies', 'Picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'high', 'special', 'feature', 'content', 'entertaining', 'insightful.This', 'content', 'extensive', 'retrospective', 'comment', 'director', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'producer', 'Ingo', 'Preminger', 'former', 'studio', 'boss', 'Richard', 'Zanuck', 'scriptwriter', 'Ring', 'Lardner', 'Jr', 'actors', 'including', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Elliott', 'Gould', 'Sally', 'Kellerman', 'Tom', 'Skerritt', 'John', 'Schuck', 'Gary', 'Burghoff', 'medical', 'veterans', 'Korean', 'War', 'see', '30th', 'anniversary', 'M*A*S*H', 'reunion', 'Fox', 'presentation', 'studio', 'life', 'achievement', 'award', 'Altman.The', 'special', 'content', 'fascinating', 'insights', 'driving', 'half-mad', 'genius', 'so', 'often', 'great', 'director', 'egos', 'bigheartedness', 'movie', 'making.Almost', 'everyone', 'scriptwriter', 'studio', 'executives', 'actors', 'lined', 'up', 'director', 'time', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Elliott', 'Gould', 'once', 'even', 'tried', 'get', 'Altman', 'fired', 'fearing', 'would', 'damage', 'careers', 'M*A*S*H', 'special', 'edition', 'features', 'eat', 'words', 'graciously', 'pay', 'tribute', 'Altman', 'Former', 'studio', 'boss', 'Richard', 'Zanuck', 'Altman', 'came', 'other', 'directors', 'were', 'afraid', 'screenplay', 'did', ""n't"", 'came', 'seemed', 'unruly', 'enough', 'be', 'able', 'understand', 'subject', 'matter', 'was', 'made', 'shoestring', 'budget', 'Fox', 'Century', 'Ranch', 'standing', 'Korea', 'emerged', 'chaotic', 'creative', 'tension', 'enormous', 'artistic', 'financial', 'success', 'Altman', 'accepted', 'salary', 'only', '75,000', 'son', 'Mike', 'reputed', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'money', 'writing', 'lyric', 'keynote', 'ballad', 'Painless', 'Johnny', 'Mandel', 'Altman', 'kept', 'costs', 'down', 'casting', 'movie', 'mostly', 'unknown', 'out-of-work', 'actors', '14', 'movie', '30', 'speaking', 'roles', 'were', 'played', 'actors', 'making', 'screen', 'debut', 'Shooting', 'finished', 'three', 'days', 'ahead', 'schedule', '1969', 'almost', 'million', 'dollars', 'budget', 'M*A*S*H', 'went', 'earn', 'more', '80', 'million', 'box', 'office', 'Palme', ""d'Or"", 'Cannes', 'Oscar', 'heavily', 'reworked', 'script', 'formerly', 'blacklisted', 'scriptwriter', 'Ring', 'Lardner', 'Jr', 'inspire', 'long-running', 'popular', 'TV', 'series.This', 'rare', 'thing', 'five', 'star', 'classic', 'movie', 'five', 'star', 'DVD', 'release']",M*A*S*H VHS

Movies like French Connection have already made the list, and now Fox debuts the greatest anti-war movie of all time, M*A*S*H.  The basis for the long-running TV series (which also debuted recently on DVD), M*A*S*H introduces us to the antics of Hawkeye Pierce (Donald Sutherland), Trapper John (Elliot Gould), Hot Lips (Sally Kellerman), and Radar (Gary Burghoff).Altman's black comic masterpiece doesn't have a solid plot so much as a series of skits and sketches about life during the war.  From golfing 5 miles from the front to suspension of marital promises to trying to figure out why people are dying all around, M*A*S*H handles the gruesomeness of stupidity of war in the only way possible - if you're not laughing, then you're going to be crying, so it's probably better to laugh.And what a way to bring this classic to DVD - the movie has never looked so good.  For being 30 years old, it looks great after Fox's extensive restoration and is presented in its original theatrical ratio of 2.35:1 with an anamorphic transfer.  There's some grain here and there, but the colors are exceptionally vibrant, with great contrast on the blacks and whites especially.  The sound mix is a decent DD 2.0, which is fine considering that the movie is mostly dialogue, but the lack of a more dynamic soundtrack was noticeable during the football game and any time there was music.  There are enough extras to make up for it, though, including Altman's commentary track, three featurettes including A&E;'s ""The Story of M*A*S*H"" and a 30-year cast reunion that's both touching and funny.The lack of the DD 5.1 soundtrack doesn't sully the otherwise pristine quality of the rest of this 2-disc set.

265608,A3VV4GUGLUVUP1,6301777387,Joel R. Bryan,"[0, 0]","Robert Altman's ""M*A*S*H"" is certainly an anti-war film in that it's set in an army hospital near the frontlines of Korea, and features battered bodies and at least once, a geyser of blood from a severed artery.  Its main characters, Hawkeye Pierce (Donald Sutherland), Trapper John McIntyre (Elliott Gould), find themselves patching together the battered remains of what were once young soldiers.But in between marathon sessions in the OR, Hawkeye and Trapper John wage their own witty war against incompetence, confomity, hypocrisy and overbearing authority.  They carouse, drink and mercilessly bully anyone who gets in their way.  Their first target is Maj. Frank Burns (a memorable performance by Robert Duvall), an overly religious and self-righteous man given to blaming others for his mistakes.  Hawk and Trap set their sights on him and never let up, and, like its protagonists, ""M*A*S*H"" proceeds to take no prisoners.There's no plot in the classic sense.  Things happen, the wounded come in waves, and our doctor heroes proceed to mock anything and everything that comes their way.  Sutherland and Gould are an amazingly funny team, quoting old movies and dropping into strange characterizations to meet every new challenge, be it recalcitrant regular Army nurse ""Hot Lips"" O'Houlihan (Sally Kellerman), befuddled CO Col. Henry Blake (Roger Bowen), or a football-crazy general (G. Bowen).Among their schemes:  faking a suicide to give a friend back his self-confidence, blackmailing an officer to save a sick child, and bringing in a ringer to win the football game that makes up the movie's uproarious climax.  In between, we get to meet such memorable characters as ""Radar"" O'Reilly (Gary Burgoff), the almost-psychic corporal, ""Painless Pole,"" (John Schuck) the ""best equipped dentist in the Army,"" and Lt. ""Dish"" (Jo Ann Pflug).  Plus Swamp-mate Duke Forrest (Tom Skerritt) and the ineffectual but well-meaning Father Mulchahy (Rene Auberjonois).Altman packs the movie with dense, overlapping dialogue.  The result is chaotic, frenzied and hilarious.  Hollywood would never dare make a movie like this today, in which traditional values are so thoroughly and hilariously trounced; ""M*A*S*H"" is a truly dangerous and subversive film.  Its doctors (and ""M*A*SH"" itself, by extension) love only honesty, intelligence, freedom... and very dry mar-tin-eyes.  With olives!  Plus, the occasional nurse.Finally, this classic has the treatment it deserves.  This ""Five Star Collection"" release (on two disks) contains a gorgeous widescreen version of the movie, Altman's commentary, the ""Backstory"" documentary, two other docus, and a restoration demo.  A brilliant film in an excellent package.",5,"""This isn't a hospital!

It has been called the first great movie of the 1970's, a seminal flic in that decade of great American cinema (perhaps the greatest.) And it shows Robert Altman at his finest, with natural dialogue and multi-layered scenes. Throw in the all-star ensemble cast and you you should have a winner.What I really liked was the hyper realism of the operating room and the medical scenes. I'm sure people thought it was pretty gory for its time, but the realism is far less ostentatiously bloody than a recent movie, like say Academy Award best picture ""The Departed.""Mind you, my opinion has now changed.First, the movie is undeniably sexist. Women are objects in the movie, and we are talking the absolutely vital nurses that, as we now know, are the real backbone of any hospital. And there is a whiff of homophobia.Additionally, I read a NYT review that suggested that this was the first mainstream movie to openly mock organized religion. Now I like a good laugh at the expense of a holy roller just as much as the next guy, for sure. But, while there are few very humourous moments, mostly these scenes come off as cruel and disrespectful.I know that this movie was really a critique of the Vietnam War dressed up as Korea (while that war was going on!) but there are just too many sour bits for me to enjoy the movie anymore.Perhaps the most annoying thing is that the movie vacillates been hyper-realistic seriousness (which it does with panache and really well,) and plain silly comedy. You know, if I was the editor, I would have taken out a few of the sillier scenes, and a lot of the sexism, and I think you'd have the ""classic"" that many people feel M*A*S*H is.But I'm not the editor, and I won't be watching it again.",1,"My, how times change, and me too!",1356134400,"12 22, 2012",2012,1888,"['Well', 'decided', 'watch', 'M*A*S*H', 'again', 'three', 'decades.My', 'how', 'times', 'change', 'saw', 'movie', 'several', 'times', 'teen', 'back', '70', 'just', 'loved', 'been', 'called', 'first', 'great', 'movie', '1970', 'seminal', 'flic', 'decade', 'great', 'American', 'cinema', 'perhaps', 'greatest', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'finest', 'natural', 'dialogue', 'multi-layered', 'scenes', 'Throw', 'all-star', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'should', 'have', 'winner.What', 'really', 'liked', 'was', 'hyper', 'realism', 'operating', 'room', 'medical', 'scenes', ""'m"", 'sure', 'people', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'gory', 'time', 'realism', 'far', 'less', 'ostentatiously', 'bloody', 'recent', 'movie', 'say', 'Academy', 'Award', 'best', 'picture', 'Departed', 'Mind', 'opinion', 'now', 'changed.First', 'movie', 'undeniably', 'sexist', 'Women', 'are', 'objects', 'movie', 'are', 'talking', 'absolutely', 'vital', 'nurses', 'now', 'know', 'are', 'real', 'backbone', 'hospital', 'whiff', 'homophobia.Additionally', 'read', 'NYT', 'review', 'suggested', 'was', 'first', 'mainstream', 'movie', 'openly', 'mock', 'organized', 'religion', 'Now', 'good', 'laugh', 'expense', 'holy', 'roller', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'next', 'guy', 'sure', 'are', 'few', 'very', 'humourous', 'moments', 'mostly', 'scenes', 'come', 'off', 'cruel', 'disrespectful.I', 'know', 'movie', 'was', 'really', 'critique', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'dressed', 'up', 'Korea', 'war', 'was', 'going', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'many', 'sour', 'bits', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'most', 'annoying', 'thing', 'movie', 'been', 'hyper-realistic', 'seriousness', 'panache', 'really', 'well', 'plain', 'silly', 'comedy', 'know', 'was', 'editor', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'out', 'few', 'sillier', 'scenes', 'lot', 'sexism', 'think', ""'d"", 'have', 'classic', 'many', 'people', 'feel', 'M*A*S*H', 'is.But', ""'m"", 'not', 'editor', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'watching', 'again']",M*A*S*H VHS

Every episode is it's own, and you have to go up menu levels to get back to the main page to pick the next episode.  For me, there is NOTHING more irritating with a TV collection than the lack of a ""Play all episodes"" option on each disc...I got this on a gold box deal, so the price was right, but not impressed with the quality of the product itself.Update - the lack of a ""Play All"" option was  resolved at Season 5, and the seasons after all have that option on each disc.  The downside is that where up to that point you could use the next track button on a remote to skip the intro song and get right to the first chapter of the actual show, after season 5, it gets random.

265615,AK81WLVD5KGUX,6301777387,"John S. Ryan ""Scott Ryan""","[43, 52]","This is one of the finest films ever made, 'countercultural' or otherwise. It's antiwar, antiauthoritarian, irreverent, sacrilegious, and utterly without anything conventionally regarded as a Redeeming Feature.It is, in short, a great, great piece of cinematic art. When it's over, not a sacred cow is left standing. And its antiwar satire, though full of wonderfully crass and tasteless comedy, is also quite serious and spot-on.If you haven't read the book by 'Richard Hooker' (Dr. Richard Hornsberger), do so. It's a good book, and it's very different from the TV series you're probably familiar with if you were alive during the 1970s. The original tale centered on three surgeons, not two, and it wasn't (as the TV series became) a vehicle for the smarmy phildonahuing of sensitive-'70s-guy Alan Alda.In fact the book and the movie are both 'racist' in the same sense as Mark Twain's timeless _Huckleberry Finn_ -- that is, not at all, but also not exactly designed to slip in under the radar of the PC Police, who wouldn't recognize _real_ racism if it bashed them in the heads with a billy club. (Likewise 'sexism'.) In developing the TV series, developer/scriptwriter Larry Gelbart toned a lot of this stuff down, but here in the film you can see it in all of its original glory.And then some. The film actually partakes more of the spirit of Joseph Heller's great _Catch-22_ and, along those lines, develops the Hooker novel's mild irreverence to the level of a take-no-prisoners martial art. (The film officially takes place during Hooker's Korean War, but just as with the screen adaptation of Heller's nominal World War II setting, everybody knew the Vietnam War was the unofficial target. And at an abstract level, _M*A*S*H_ is a better screen adaptation of _Catch-22_ than the film version of that novel itself.)Even other satire isn't immune from 'meta-satire'. This film was produced at a time when other countercultural books and movies regularly relied on Christian imagery (_Cool Hand Luke_, _One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest_, _The Omega Man_) to turn their central heroes/antiheroes into savior-figures. Here, Robert Altman and Ring Lardner, Jr., had the temerity to skewer even their artistic allies by turning the Painless Pole (John Schuck in his first major film role) into the central figure at a suicidal 'Last Supper'. (Even here, in thus expanding on Painless's suicide, they took a lead from the book's own irreverence. In the novel, the guys paraded around the South Korean countryside with a longhaired and bearded Trapper hanging from a cross.) _Nobody_ is safe around this cinematic buzz saw.You probably already know who's in it, but I'd better give a quick nod to the marvelous performances by the Big Three: Donald Sutherland as Hawkeye Pierce, Elliot Gould as 'Trapper' John McIntyre, and Tom Skerritt as Duke Forrest. (I particularly call your attention to Skerritt, who seldom gets the credit he deserves for this role because -- under the influence of the TV series -- people tend to think the movie is mainly about Hawkeye and Trapper.) Everybody else is wonderful too, and I won't try to mention the entire cast by name here.In general this rambling masterpiece isn't susceptible to easy summarization.

It's considered to be one of, director, Robert Altman's greatest artistic achievements. The movie even inspired the hit TV show of the same name. I've never watched that show, so all this material is new to me. But this film deserves all the praise it got. This is a great film. Donald Sutherland (who looked a lot like son Kiefer Sutherland when he was younger) plays Hawkeye; Elliot Gould plays Trapper; and Tom Skeritt plays Duke. All the men are highly skilled Army surgeons, but they don't look like it. They frequently drink, play pranks on one-another, make jokes; Which, of course, pisses a lot of people off. When they're put into a tent with the overly-religious Major Burns (Robert Duvall), they do everything they can to get him out. When they learn he's having an affair with the new nurse (Sally Kellerman), they affectionately nickname her Hot Lips. True, most of the humor is sexual humor which will turn a lot of people off...But this is truly a classic comedy. It's funny, never dull, and all the actors are so good at playing these characters. Elliot Gould and Donald Sutherland in particular, are truly really good. I don't know how it holds up to the TV show, as I said earlier, but this is a great movie.

Of course, I had heard of MASH though and was looking forward to this video of the original 1969 screenplay. I expected to enjoy it completely.  WRONG!Directed by Robert Altman, the screenplay was written by Ring Lardner Jr., adapted from the novel by Richard Hooker. It takes place in a medical facility during the Korean War and shows doctors working with war victims, saving lives daily in a primitive operating room. It's a comedy though, and everything is exaggerated, from the extraordinary amount of blood in the operating room scenes to the practical jokes these doctors play. They are often covered in blood and some of the scenes are not for the squeamish as they wisecrack and flirt and oppose military authority throughout, drinking and drugging and romping with the bimbo nurses.  It's all is supposed to be great fun.Donald Sutherland plays Hawkeye and Elliott Gould plays trapper.  They are both surgeons who use every bit of their spare time partying.  Robert Duvall is also a surgeon but he sprouts dogmatic religious philosophy and blames others for his mistakes. Early on, he's eliminated after a practical joke that makes him and the head nurse, played by Sally Kellerman, the laughing stock of the company.  In one of the overlapping stories, the men cure a potential suicide victim who questions his manhood by letting a nurse use her body to cure him of his delusion.  And then there's a football game in which the MASH team wins by cheating.I know this is all supposed to really be about the stupidity of the Vietnam War.  It's supposed to make us sympathize and identify with the hard-working doctors who have to put up with petty military rules.  It's supposed to be funny.  I even cracked a smile or two.  But I didn't laugh when they humiliated a nurse by exposing her nakedness while taking a shower.  I didn't laugh when the decision to commit suicide seemed an all-right solution for someone who thought he was gay.  I didn't laugh when the MASH team won the football game because they used hypodermic needles on the opposing team.  Instead, I raised an eyebrow and wondered about the mindset of people in 1969 -- when it was funny to see women as mindless, gay people has having to be cured, and drugs the answer to every question.  I, myself, would have thought it was funny then.  I don't now.I can't really give MASH a bad recommendation.  After all, it was a classic in its time.  The acting was excellent, the timing of the jokes perfect.  And it certainly captured the absurdity of war.  It's an interesting historical study of America then.  And it's worth seeing for that alone.  But then was then.  And now is now.  I just can't help it if it's 2002.",3,It might have been funny in 1969.

Featuring many of the same characters, MASH is about a crew of doctors and nurses at an army hospital near the front lines. While supposedly set in Korea, this was made in 1970 and is fairly clearly pointed at the Vietnam war. It shows just how pointless war can be, how people live and die almost by chance, and how the characters struggle to keep their sanity amongst it all.It's not a ""story"" as much as almost a reality show, and apparently portions of the dialogue were ad-libbed as the actors got into their characters. You see how relationships and loyalties get tested, how playing golf on a helicopter landing pad seems to make perfect sense, and how the doctors try their best to save their young friend from going into the army. If you watched the TV series it can be hard, sometimes, to separate how the characters were in the TV series with how they are here - there are numerous differences.There are all sorts of subtle items in here. For example, in one scene the actors pose in an exact replica of The Last Supper.Well worth watching to get a sense of what people thought about the Vietnam War in the 70s, and just to immerse yourself in absurdity for a while. MASH helps to illustrate that even amongst death and carnage, people tend to go on with life as best they can, finding love, joy, and moments of peace.In terms of the Bechdel test, MASH passes - barely. An opening scene has a table of nurses all talking with each other, and two of them end up being minor characters with names. They are talking about nursing activity. However, that is really it. Through the rest of the movie there are really only three female characters. One is a blonde who sleeps with the commanding officer, one is a feistier nurse that ends up ""saving"" the Dentist by sleeping with him, and then one is the infamous Hot Lips who falls for Major Burns. So we do have three females - but they really don't talk with each other at all after that opening scene. They are just there to be slept with by the guys.",5,Great View into Vietnam (via Korea),1327449600,"01 25, 2012",2012,2146,"['MASH', 'also', 'known', 'M*A*S*H', 'perhaps', 'better', 'known', 'long', 'running', 'TV', 'series', 'was', 'award', 'winning', 'movie', 'came', 'first', 'Featuring', 'many', 'same', 'characters', 'MASH', 'crew', 'doctors', 'nurses', 'army', 'hospital', 'front', 'lines', 'supposedly', 'set', 'Korea', 'was', 'made', '1970', 'fairly', 'clearly', 'pointed', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'just', 'how', 'pointless', 'war', 'can', 'be', 'how', 'people', 'live', 'die', 'almost', 'chance', 'how', 'characters', 'struggle', 'keep', 'sanity', 'all.It', 'not', 'story', 'as', 'much', 'almost', 'reality', 'show', 'apparently', 'portions', 'dialogue', 'were', 'ad-libbed', 'actors', 'got', 'characters', 'see', 'how', 'relationships', 'loyalties', 'get', 'tested', 'how', 'playing', 'golf', 'helicopter', 'landing', 'pad', 'make', 'perfect', 'sense', 'how', 'doctors', 'try', 'best', 'save', 'young', 'friend', 'going', 'army', 'watched', 'TV', 'series', 'can', 'be', 'hard', 'sometimes', 'separate', 'how', 'characters', 'were', 'TV', 'series', 'how', 'are', 'here', 'are', 'numerous', 'differences.There', 'are', 'sorts', 'subtle', 'items', 'here', 'example', 'one', 'scene', 'actors', 'pose', 'exact', 'replica', 'Last', 'Supper.Well', 'worth', 'watching', 'get', 'sense', 'what', 'people', 'thought', 'Vietnam', 'War', '70s', 'just', 'immerse', 'absurdity', 'while', 'MASH', 'illustrate', 'even', 'amongst', 'death', 'carnage', 'people', 'tend', 'go', 'life', 'can', 'finding', 'love', 'joy', 'moments', 'peace.In', 'terms', 'Bechdel', 'test', 'MASH', 'barely', 'opening', 'scene', 'table', 'nurses', 'talking', 'other', 'two', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'minor', 'characters', 'names', 'are', 'talking', 'nursing', 'activity', 'However', 'really', 'rest', 'movie', 'are', 'really', 'only', 'three', 'female', 'characters', 'One', 'blonde', 'who', 'commanding', 'officer', 'one', 'feistier', 'nurse', 'up', 'saving', 'Dentist', 'sleeping', 'then', 'one', 'infamous', 'Hot', 'Lips', 'who', 'Major', 'Burns', 'do', 'have', 'three', 'females', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'talk', 'other', 'opening', 'scene', 'are', 'just', 'there', 'be', 'slept', 'guys']",M*A*S*H VHS

Donald Sutherland (Hawkeye) and Elliot Gould (Trapper) are both brilliant as the crazy surgeons trying to keep sane among the chaos of war. The tone of the film is wilder than in the TV series, of the original movie cast only Gargy Burghoff (Radar) went on to star in the Tv version. These days I find I prefer Donald Sutherland's Hawkeye, Alan Alda's unrelenting niceness gets on my nerves a bit. In the film version there are two other surgeons who share Trapper and Hawkeye's anarchic activities, Duke Forrest and Spearchucker Jones (you will recall there was a halfhearted attempt to make Spearchucker a regular character in the early TV episodes, but he soon faded from view). I love the bit in the movie when Duke, a southerner is told they are going to be sharing their accomodation with a black surgeon and he remarks plaintively &quot;It's bad enough having to share with you two Yankees&quot;. Uptight army nurse Margaret Houlihan is subjected to much rougher treatment than she gets on TV, as in the scene where her all is exposed when the doctors cause the shower to collapse while she's using it, in order to settle an argument over whether she is a natural blonde or not. Then there's the grand climatic football match, where some very dirty tactics are brought into play to make sure the M.A.S.H. team win.

Those who loved the TV series.  Those who loved the movie.  Each group has its reasons why one is better than the other. I read Hooker's two MASH books and  found them funny and in the second one,touching. I enjoyed parts of the TV series, but the movie changed me.  MASH is one of those few movies that people know exactly where they were when they saw this movie and these types of  movies are very rare. I saw MASH in 1970 as a sneak preview to a B motorcycle movie[see my other reviews].  The house was packed because of the first movie and there were very few women there.  The movie started and the  music began and I had no idea what the h__l was going on. As the movie went on I found myself lost in every scene. I laugh because I wanted too, the laughter wasn't forced.  I can remember each scene clearly even today. But as I was watching the movie, I was thinking this isn't Korea, but a jab at Viet Nam.  I slowly realized that I was being shown an anti war movie.  A very good anti war movie that wasn't beating me over the head, but softly creaping into my mind.  In the late 60s and early 70s there were many anti war movies and they were not subtle at all.  People found them to be a big turn off, but not this movie.Looking back at it now, this movie pole vaulted Sutherland and Gould to superstar status.  We began to see movies with * in the titles, i.e S*P*Y*S, which was horrible.  WIFFS starting Gould was another anti war comedy, I am joking here it was terrible. But these two did do many very good movies, DON""T LOOK NOW [best sex scene ever} and the LONG GOODBYE.MASH opened my eyes to power of movie making, from the great script by Larnder, acting, filming, and theme song.  I never watched this movie again because of the strong impression it left on me.  It colored my view of the TV series and lead me to the books by Richard Hooker.  Don't mention those MASH GOES TO whatever series.This generation now remembers only the TV series and then only a lttle.  The kids today may see the TV series on some channel in the afternoon, but go on to something else.  This is to bad because this movie still holds up.  I have listen to students, who saw MASH at their college or in a film study class, rave about how funny it is and how much better it is than the TV series.  They ask me if I have seen it?  I smile and and shake my head.  I have asked them,"" Is that all it is ?  A comedy?""  The answer is always yes.  Today with the wars that are going on, MASH is just a comedy?

265642,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,6301777387,magellan,"[3, 5]","In this review I compare MASH with Catch-22, and then include a little plug for another funny, anti-war movie at the end which you may not have heard about that's worth seeing too.I'd never seen the original movie all the way through until I watched it for the first time last week, so for me this was truly a blast from the past. I was familiar with some of the funniest moments, such as the broadcast of Dr. Burns's and Hot Lips' little tete a tete, but had never actually seen it. Having watched the TV series, I was familiar with the concept, but the legendary original Altman flick that the series was based on was something I'd somehow missed.As a previous writer here said, it's really a series of four vignettes rather than a coherent movie with a real plot, and the whole movie is an irreverent, sacreligious, and anti-authoritarian and satirical spoof from beginning to end. In other words, it's a very funny movie perhaps lacking any redeeming qualities whatsoever except for that. :-)For me it was a bit of a shock to see all these actors 30 years younger, as I mostly knew them from their later work, such as Rene Aberjonois, who I mostly knew from Star Trek Deep Space Nine as the constable Shape Shifter. Gary Burghoff was the only member of the original cast who ended up in the TV series, and Donald Sutherland still looks the same. And I really only knew Bud Cort from his classic movie, Harold and Maude.I made the same comment to a friend about the movie, that it's reminiscent of Joseph Heller's Catch-22, but my friend, who's much more knowledgeable about movies than I, pointed out that they're really two very different flicks both in spirit and in content. Although both are ostensibly anti-war, Catch-22 is a much more cynical and dark movie which sees little good in human behavior and society and doesn't even hold forth the hope let alone the promise of something better. In that sense it's a truly nihilistic film.MASH is much more lighthearted and shows the characters trying to make the best of a horrible situation as they stumble through the trials and tribulations of the war with, as someone once said about Cary Grant, a sort of ""goofy exasperatedness."" As one of the characters said, we're all basically crazy anyway, and in MASH that's how everyone keeps their sanity.So overall, if not a great movie, a great period piece that is still worth your time and money to rent it.Since we're on the subject of anti-war movies, I can't resist plugging another of my favorites, since it's a great flick and is much less known than the above two. This is The King of Hearts, a French film starring a very young looking Alan Bates and Genevieve Bujold, who are known the U.S., but the other main actors mostly aren't, although some people will remember Adolpho Celli as the heavy in Goldfinger, the James Bond film.As with MASH, the film is a darkly satiric comedy that pokes fun at the absurdity and futility of war. The main plot concerns a group of inmates from a local insane asylum who escape during the chaos and confusion into an abandoned French town, which sets the stage to ironically contrast the insanity of war brought by supposedly sane people with the harmless behavior of the supposedly insane inmates who are acting out the roles of normal town citizens. And yet it is the innocuous and inoffensive inmates who are caged and the supposedly sane people are making war.The inmates wander into the town and assume various roles, acting like typical citizens, from the barber to the mayor. The inmates do this so convincingly that the young corporal (played by Bates) who is sent to warn them of the approaching Germans at first doesn't realize they are escaped mental patients, which becomes a metaphor for the real question in the move, which is, who is really crazier: the inmates, or the ""normal"" people and soldiers fighting the war?Unfortunately, although he tries, Bates is unable to avert the confrontation between the British and German companies who march into town, and when the two contingents shoot it out (everyone is killed to the last man), the inmates realize the fun is over, that they don't belong in ""sane society,"" and it's time for them to go back to their former home in the asylum.As I said, I didn't know most of the cast, except for Adolpho Celi, Alan Bates, and Genevieve Bujold, but I thought all the performances were superb, especially Jean- Claude Brialy, who played the mayer, Pierre Brasseur, who played General Geranium, and the barber (unfortunately I don't recall his real name.

265650,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,6301777387,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[2, 3]","When most people think of ""M*A*S*H"", they often think of the 1970's television sitcom that ran for 11-years on CBS and continues to be aired in syndication to this day.  The series acquired and continues to maintain millions of fans, but many of the fans have never seen the original film that inspired the series.  The original film is much darker than the series.From the 1960's atmosphere of cultural revolution, civil rights, the Cold War and anti-war sentiment exacerbated by the carnage of the Vietnam War, the director Robert Altman created a brilliant and realistic vision of the human tragedy of war in his film ""M*A*S*H"", but in a very humorous way.  Unlike its war film predecessors, ""M*A*S*H"" does not glorify generals, battles, or politicians.  Instead, ""M*A*S*H"" portrays the lives of doctors and nurses at Mobile Army Surigcal Hospital 4077 attempting to maintain their sanity while struggling to save the lives of the young soldiers fighting and dying in the Korean War.""M*A*S*H"" opens with the well-known theme song, but it includes lyrics that may take many by surprise: ""suicide is painless, it brings on many changes"".  We then see the initial arrival of Captain Benjamin Franklin ""Hawkeye"" Pierce (portrayed by Donald Sutherland) in Korea at a military airbase that is very dirty, muddy and gray.  When he arrives at MASH 4077, we see a very hairy Captain Francis Xavier ""Trapper John"" McIntyre (portrayed by Elliot Gould) sitting in the mess tent.  Hawkeye and Trapper John find their irreverance for the military and authority in common and become close friends as time passes, and that friendship is also shared with Captain Augustus Bedford ""Duke"" Forrest (portrayed by Tom Skerritt).  Duke was the only major film character that was not included in the TV series.Two majors at MASH 4077 don't share the irreverance for authority that Hawkeye, Trapper & Duke have: Major Frank Burns (portrayed by Robert Duvall) who is often seen reading from the bible, and military-career-minded Major Margaret ""Hot Lips"" O'Houlihan (portrayed by Sally Kellerman).  On the surface, each of the majors is quite dedicated to their belief in the military, but the reality is that each is quite hypocritical.  They give in to their passions one night (Frank is married), but it does not go unnoticed; and Margaret earns her knickname of ""Hot Lips"".In command of this motley group is the inept Lieutenant Colonel Henry Blake (portrayed by Roger Bowen), who is assisted by the faithful company clerk Corporal Walter ""Radar"" O'Reilly (portrayed by Gary Burghoff--the only film cast member to play the same role in the long-running TV series).The brilliant collage of scenes, including the bloody operating room scenes, and the stark cinematography create a powerful message from the mind of Robert Altman--war is a mixture of death, physical suffering and emotional torment, not all glory and honor.If you're a long time fan of the television series and have never seen the original film, there is a good chance that you won't like the film; but if you're a serious cinema aficionado, ""M*A*S*H"" should be in your collection because it is probably one of the best films of all time.The rendering of the film on DVD is very well done and the commentaries and documentaries on the second DVD are a great bonus.

We're willing to accept anything, absolutely anything, in real life.  But we demand order from our fantasies"".That is so true because at first watching the movie and having been in the military i was like there is no way they could punch a higher ranking officer, sexually harass anyone let alone a superior, have mustaches and haircuts like that and wear the clothes they wear and i wasn't one of the uptight guys in the military by any means.Then about halfway through i thought to myself I'm finding it hard to accept a haircut and a mustache that's in a movie, yet i could watch the bloodiest war film and not question it or for that matter watch war any night of the week for real on the news.  When you think about it what should be harder to accept?Maybe we shouldn't accept just anything in real life and have it be our fantasies that run wild.Speaking of fantasy, i was done writing this review hours ago and i got this idea.  M.A.S.H could've been in the minds of me, my friends, or other guys in the military during all the hurry up and waiting.  The movie could be two guys that are in this unit who talk and have conversations about ""oh i'd like to do this or i'd like to punch that guy"" and we could be seeing their imaginations and their conversations played out for us.The fact that I'm still analyzing it shows how great a director Altman was  and what a good movie can do.

265657,A3IB1W0SVED0Z3,6301777387,"Mike Powers ""mkp51""","[73, 79]","Probably no cinematic comedy produced by Hollywood in the last half of the twentieth century is as irreverent, disdainful of authority, critical of war and its effects, and, incidentally, as funny as ""M*A*S*H"", that 1970 comedic masterpiece starring Donald Sutherland, Elliott Gould, Tom Skerritt, Gary Burghoff, and Sally Kellerman; written by Ring Lardner, Jr.; and directed by Robert Altman, in his directorial debut.""M*A*S*H"" is actually a very difficult film to review for a variety of reasons. First and foremost, it's darned near impossible to provide an adequate synopsis for readers who've never seen the movie. Because, unlike most modern films that contain a linear story line, an easy-to-follow plot, and well developed characters that one can either root for or vilify with ease, ""M*A*S*H"" is a film that can only be described as a series of loosely joined comic vignettes, featuring a set of very true-to-life characters that are all BOTH very likeable and flawed.""M*A*S*H"" is one of the best comedies ever made, and for good reason. It is genuinely funny. It is artistically produced; it contains great writing and acting; and it proclaims an important social message to viewers.Having said all that, ""M*A*S*H"" is very likely NOT a movie that will appeal to everyone's tastes - even now, 32 years after it was first released. How the movie was written and produced has a lot to do with that fact.As the story goes, the idea for producing a movie version ""M*A*S*H"" got its start when literary agent Ingo Preminger referred Dr. Richard Hooker's famous novel of the same name to 20th Century Fox executive Richard Zanuck. Zanuck enthusiastically supported the idea, hired Preminger as the movie's producer, and set out to find a screen writer and director. Ring Lardner Jr. (son of the famous 1930s sports writer) was brought in to write the script. Robert Altman was hired to direct. (As Altman tells it, he was about the ""13th choice"" of the studio to direct.)Shooting began during the summer of 1969. At the same time, the films ""Patton"" and ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" were in production. Altman, eager to be successful in his first major film, decided to ""hide out"" on a back lot of the studio, where he would escape the watchful eyes of studio executives.As a result, Altman was able to apply many innovative techniques to the film. He wanted his actors to improvise as much as possible in each scene. He wired each actor with an individual microphone and encouraged them to talk over one another. He incorporated several bloody operating room scenes in the film. He tried to mask the fact that the film was supposed to be set during the Korean War. He wanted audiences to assume that this was a film about Vietnam, and he wanted them to understand his clear message about the monstrosity of war.(By the way, Altman's technique enraged Lardner, who thought Altman had basically thrown away the script. Lardner came perilously close to disassociating himself from the project, but in the end, accepted both the sole writing credit for the film... and the Oscar for Best Screenplay at the 1971 Academy Awards.).Because of Altman's innovative (some say crazy) filmmaking techniques, ""M*A*S*H"" succeeds as a brilliant film that achieves almost all of Altman's goals. The film is deeply imbued with a lifelike realism that allows viewers to ""feel"" what it was like in the fictional 4077th MASH. The actors speak like one would expect them to when confronted with the reality of war and the boredom of inactivity.Comedy scenes are uniformly uproariously funny, employing jokes and gags that range from subtle to coarse to borderline lewd. Interspersed with the comedy scenes are operating room sequences that are bloody to the point of horrific, but that bring home with full force the full brutality of war... so much so that, for a short time, the Defense Department banned the ""M*A*S*H"" from being shown in military theaters worldwide.I've read some reviews of ""M*A*S*H"" in which a criticism is leveled that the movie's characters are not well developed. I disagree with this judgment. I found I was readily able to identify with all the characters, whether they were likeable or not. Hawkeye, Duke, Trapper, Frank, Hot Lips, Henry, Radar, and all the others were completely believable, and fleshed out in detail... no small feat since the actors who played these parts were directed to perform their roles in such a highly improvisational manner.""M*A*S*H"" is one of those rare films that gives viewers everything they could ask for from a great film: wonderfully realistic acting; a great script; brilliantly funny comedy; superb drama, important social commentary; and artful, innovative filmmaking techniques. ""M*A*S*H"" has steadfastly stood the test of time for thirty years, never becoming outdated or irrelevant. Whether you've never seen it, or, like me, you've seen it many times: RUN, don't walk, to your nearest video store and check it out!",5,"""The game of life is hard to play, I'm gonna lose it

265658,A27PSZX2SE0B51,6301777387,Mike Stone,"[6, 7]","The Robert Altman style, so familiar to moviegoers over the last thirty years, was unleashed from the womb here.  The documentary-style camera work, laying back from the action but given license to zoom in and out as it sees fit, works its wonders best in the operation scenes.  Three tables of patients and doctors, all acting at once, and the camera still manages to capture every piece of relevant information, without making the whole mess confusing.  The overlapping dialogue, which I imagine gave those charged with subtitling the DVD version fits, works in much the same way.  No one would ever confuse ""M*A*S*H"" for anything but a Robert Altman film.Despite the absence of battle, ""M*A*S*H"" is not devoid of blood.  The surgery sequences are filled to the brim with the red stuff, and serve as a stark contrast to the movie's more goofy comedic moments.  Sometimes within the same scene.  One notable example: Hawkeye, with a note of apprehension on his face, must saw off a wounded man's leg.  After a few strokes back and forth -- complete with cringe-inducing, nails-on-the-blackboard-style sound effects -- he asks the nurse for a clamp.  What for? she asks.  To scratch his nose, he cheekily replies, and the laugh they share perfectly diffuses the horrific moment.  This scene, to me, is ""M*A*S*H"" in a nutshell.When thinking of the characters who inhabit ""M*A*S*H""s landscape I am reminded of the realization I had while watching George Cukor's ""The Philadelphia Story"".  It's a film that makes its audience root for the stuck-up rich girl and the spoiled rude millionaire layabout, two character types often cast in roles of villainy, while fostering resentment towards a man who earned his fortune by pulling himself up by his bootstraps, usually the hero.  It's a neat trick that that movie pulls off cleanly.  And so does this one.  Hawkeye, Trapper, Duke, et al., are terribly mean men.  They are type-A personalities all, unwillingly to accept anyone who doesn't conform to their lofty, intellectual standards, or their well-developed sense of anarchy.  But just as the humour of the film is a defense mechanism against the insanity of war, this cruelty also serves a purpose.  Anyone without a strong character and an affinity for the kind of team these men are building must be weeded out and destroyed.  It's this realization that allows the audience to sympathize with the tormentors rather than the tormentees.  And it allows you to let down your moralistic guard and like them just the same.Still, there are some moments here that go so far over the line that even a liberal observer like myself, one who can casually accept immorality in movies because art must exist in an amoral state, gasping.  ""Can I still like these men, given their actions?"" I often found myself asking.  There are facets of the film that embrace casual sexuality bordering on harassment and casual racism worn as a badge of honour.  An example of the former is the way the men treat Hot Lips, ""army clown"" that she is, as an object of both desire and ridicule.  An example of the latter can be found in some of the self-imposed nicknames the men give themselves: Painless Pole, Dago Red, Spearchucker Jones, etc.  True, the obscenity of warfare is a much harsher villain than the obscenities the men practice ('obscenity' is too judgmental a word for my tastes, but I'll let it stand in the absence of anything better), which is why the film is allowed to go to such lengths.  But be warned that much here is designed to make the audience uncomfortable, and to question their beliefs.Balancing this discomfort is a dramatis personae full of characters that are wonderfully likable despite their flaws.  Hawkeye Pierce is probably the most developed character, brought to life by some witty dialogue and some fine acting by then-unknown Donald Sutherland.  Hawkeye is a man of many mannerisms: he calls everyone ""Babe"", he's constantly hiding behind his downturned cap and thick spectacles, and, with apologies to Karen Silkwood and Woodward & Bernstein, he's cinema's greatest whistleblower, punctuating each moment with the same simple three-note phrase.  There's a casual elegance that Sutherland brings to Hawkeye (and every other role he's ever played) that shines through even the swampiest of settings here.  Elliott Gould's Trapper is a Zen-like shaggy dog, ravenous in his appetites but dedicated to his surgery.  Gould has a calmness about him that belies the man's manic nature, but it all fits together so well.  Hawkeye and Trapper are one of film's greatest subversive comedy teams; they seem to share a brain, so easily are their plans hatched and executed.The rest of the cast, primarily made up of unknowns, are mostly spotless.  Duvall, as Frank Burns, brings dignity and composure to a man who is supposed to be inept as a surgeon and as a man.  Sally Kellerman is loud and abrasive and stiff as Hot Lips Houliahan, a woman who, despite her sexy exterior, is supposed to be loud and abrasive and stiff.  Tom Skerritt brings some southern charm, and a hint of incongruity, to Duke Forrest, Hawkeye and Trapper's cohort in cruelty.  Roger Bowen, Rene Auberjonois, Gary Burghoff, John Schuck and Bud Cort all get about the same amount of screentime, fill up the backgrounds admirably, and do yeoman's work when they're called to the front.Robert Altman, a director whose work and style I've never been able to give my heart to, managed to craft a wonderfully satiric and entertaining little anti-war picture, that I can wholeheartedly endorse.  To top off this particularly tasty confection, he's added one of the most self-aware closing credit sequences ever put on film.  They are meta-credits, if you'll allow me to coin a phrase.  ""Attention,"" comes the squawk of the loudspeaker, ""tonight's movie has been 'M*A*S*H'.""  Before introducing the ensemble, Altman and Co. soften the blow and provide one final laugh.",5,"I've Been Drafted Into The Army Of ""M*A*S*H"" Fans",1029110400,"08 12, 2002",2002,5934,"['Robert',

By fusing the free love attitude of the counterculture and the lack of regard for authority of most of the 4077th's surgeons into a humorous film, he made light of things to hammer home his point that war is madness and people will do anything to cope.  M*A*S*H made stars of several young actors like Donald Sutherland and Elliot Gould who played the two irreverent leads, Hawkeye Pierce and Trapper John McIntyre respectively.  Mr. Sutherland is the backbone of the film and his portrayal of the Hawkeye is superb.  Mr. Gould is extremely funny and glib as Trapper John.  Other standout performances include Tom Skerritt as Duke, Robert Duvall as the fanatical Frank Burns and Sally Kellerman as the uptight Hop Lips Houlihan.  Mr. Altman wasn't well known at the time, but after the huge commercial and critical success of M*A*S*H, he became a major player and went on to make several hallmark films.

Despite so many reviewers complaining about film grain and shoddy picture quality/clarity, the main problem is that the image has been tampered with in regard to size. The picture quality is perfectly fine, considering that this film was not shot in hi-def and not even with a very big budget (this is as clear as M*A*S*H will get...and the image clarity is better than ever).The only problem I have, is that the film's title did NOT fit on the screen (the left leg of the letter ""M"" and half of the right leg of the letter ""H"" are off screen when the title is shown during the film's opening). I immediately threw on my old standard DVD for a comparison, and that one fit perfectly. In fact, on the standard DVD, there is a comfortable margin of space on screen to the left and right of the title. This sizing error continues throughout the entire Blu-Ray version of the film. At one point, Altman holds a shot which is intended to be a take on ""The Last Supper"", and the character sitting on the far right end of the table is only half in the frame (this compromises the artistic intent of the director).

265696,A29G5EPQLSY06G,6301777387,Ron Heck,"[6, 6]","I've been a fan of MASH (the movie, not the TV show) since I first saw it at about age 14 or 15 on DVD.  Recently, I've been getting into the rest of Altman's movies, so when I saw the blu ray I knew I had to check it out.  If you haven't seen it yet, MASH is a bit of a (pardon me) mash up of a war movie, medical drama, and Animal House.  Okay, it's really just a lot like Animal House.  Some reviews I've seen online have pegged this movie as being sexist and outdated, but the film is really about the attitudes of a bunch of really talented and really bored twenty something male doctors BS-ing and causing trouble.  Unlike the most of Altman's other work, this is very much a guy movie.  I used to think this movie was just effortlessly brilliant and an easy going good time with a bunch of funny actors just doing whatever they felt like.  On subsequent viewing after all these years, I can see just how much Altman's distinctive style had already taken shape in his first film.  The scene towards the ends of the movie in long shot with Hawkeye getting news from Radar is absolutely astonishing in how much it conveys with no words at all.  Even though I still remembered all the jokes and cringed at the awkwardness of some of the characters, I still found myself laughing out loud at some of the more subtle moments.Of course, these little bits might have gone unnoticed had I not sprung for the HD version.  Again, other reviews on the films picture quality range from decent to miserable and the real result is somewhere in between.  Immediately after watching the disc, I popped in the old THX mastered DVD, upconverted by my blu ray player.  I'll admit I was a bit surprised.  The major problem with the blu ray is an excessive amount of blooming on any scenes with white clothing.  They give off a glow a few centimeters out from the characters.  I first thought this was haloing, but no, they were just really bright in comparison with the dark backgrounds.  On the DVD, this effect was a lot less noticeable, but everything else picture-wise was worse.  For one, the image was a lot darker, smudging out a lot of fine detail.  The rest was lost in the digital noise and non-film related pixelated graininess.  However, in stripping away the murk on the blu ray, it revealed Altman's almost vaseline-like filter on the camera and color timing intended to accentuate the drab military greens.The first thing I looked for on the blu ray was just how much grain they did or didn't leave on the image.  Thankfully, they left most of it in, but it does get a little overwhelming at times, with it seeming to snow over background scenery.  There's a lot more surface detail on fabrics and the stubble on the actors' faces stands out a bit more.  There's a scene near the beginning of the movie with nurses looking into a tent giggling that was less apparent on DVD, since it was so quick and more difficult to read facial expressions.  I'm once again going to repeat the mantra of almost every reviewer covering HD movies from the 70's - this is probably the best this movie is going to look.  The main reason I bought this was just to see what 70s Altman movie can look like in high definition.  I assure you that now I'm going to hold out for the HD version of Nashville, instead of buying the DVD.As far as sound goes... well, I honestly couldn't tell you if it was an improvement or not.  I don't have a surround sound system to really put the track to test, but I don't think there can be that much of an improvement over the 5.1 mix on the original DVD.  I do think I could follow the rapid overlapping better than I used to, but that probably just comes from repeated viewing, rather than a real technical achievement.  All of the extras were ported over from the previous disc, which is good, since it was a fairly packed two disc set.  However, there's no real new stuff to be had.  Overall, I'm really just jonesing to see how McCabe and Mrs. Miller, Brewster McCloud, and Nashville hold up on the format.  It may not look perfect, or even that good, but this disc shows just what a little TLC can do towards making great murky-looking 70s films watchable on HD sets.",4,A considerable improvement (I think),1255392000,"10 13, 2009",2009,4187,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'MASH', 'movie', 'not', 'TV', 'show', 'first', 'saw', 'about', 'age', '14', '15', 'DVD', 'Recently', ""'ve"", 'been', 'getting', 'rest', 'Altman', 'movies', 'when', 'saw', 'blu', 'ray', 'knew', 'had', 'check', 'out', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'MASH', 'bit', 'mash', 'war', 'movie', 'medical', 'drama', 'Animal', 'House', 'Okay', 'really', 'just', 'lot', 'Animal', 'House', 'reviews', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'online', 'have', 'pegged', 'movie', 'being', 'sexist', 'outdated', 'film', 'really', 'attitudes', 'bunch', 'really', 'talented', 'really', 'bored', 'twenty', 'something', 'male', 'doctors', 'BS-ing', 'causing', 'trouble', 'most', 'Altman', 'other', 'work', 'very', 'much', 'guy', 'movie', 'used', 'think', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'effortlessly', 'brilliant', 'easy', 'going', 'good', 'time', 'bunch', 'funny', 'actors', 'just', 'doing', 'whatever', 'felt', 'subsequent', 'viewing', 'years', 'can', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'Altman', 'distinctive', 'style', 'had', 'already', 'taken', 'shape', 'first', 'film', 'scene', 'ends', 'movie', 'long', 'shot', 'Hawkeye', 'getting', 'news', 'Radar', 'absolutely', 'astonishing', 'how', 'much', 'words', 'Even', 'still', 'remembered', 'jokes', 'cringed', 'awkwardness', 'characters', 'still', 'found', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'more', 'subtle', 'moments.Of', 'course', 'little', 'bits', 'might', 'have', 'gone', 'unnoticed', 'had', 'not', 'sprung', 'HD', 'version', 'Again', 'other', 'reviews', 'films', 'picture', 'quality', 'range', 'decent', 'miserable', 'real', 'result', 'somewhere', 'Immediately', 'watching', 'disc', 'popped', 'old', 'THX', 'mastered', 'DVD', 'upconverted', 'blu', 'ray', 'player', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'was', 'bit', 'surprised', 'major', 'problem', 'blu', 'ray', 'excessive', 'amount', 'blooming', 'scenes', 'white', 'clothing', 'give', 'off', 'glow', 'few', 'centimeters', 'out', 'characters', 'first', 'thought', 'was', 'haloing', 'were', 'just', 'really', 'bright', 'comparison', 'dark', 'backgrounds', 'DVD', 'effect', 'was', 'lot', 'less', 'noticeable', 'everything', 'else', 'picture-wise', 'was', 'worse', 'one', 'image', 'was', 'lot', 'darker', 'smudging', 'out', 'lot', 'fine', 'detail', 'rest', 'was', 'lost', 'digital', 'noise', 'non-film', 'related', 'pixelated', 'graininess', 'However', 'stripping', 'away', 'murk', 'blu', 'ray', 'revealed', 'Altman', 'almost', 'vaseline-like', 'filter', 'camera', 'color', 'timing', 'intended', 'accentuate', 'drab', 'military', 'greens.The', 'first', 'thing', 'looked', 'blu', 'ray', 'was', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'grain', 'did', 'did', ""n't"", 'leave', 'image', 'Thankfully', 'left', 'most', 'get', 'little', 'overwhelming', 'times', 'seeming', 'snow', 'over', 'scenery', 'lot', 'more', 'surface', 'detail', 'fabrics', 'stubble', 'actors', 'out', 'bit', 'more', 'scene', 'beginning', 'movie', 'nurses', 'looking', 'tent', 'giggling', 'was', 'less', 'apparent', 'DVD', 'was', 'so', 'quick', 'more', 'difficult', 'read', 'facial', 'expressions', ""'m"", 'once', 'again', 'going', 'repeat', 'mantra', 'almost', 'reviewer', 'covering', 'HD', 'movies', '70', 'probably', 'best', 'movie', 'going', 'look', 'main', 'reason', 'bought', 'was', 'just', 'see', 'what', '70s', 'Altman', 'movie', 'can', 'look', 'high', 'definition', 'assure', 'now', ""'m"", 'going', 'hold', 'out', 'HD', 'version', 'Nashville', 'instead', 'buying', 'DVD.As', 'far', 'sound', 'well', 'honestly', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'was', 'improvement', 'not', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'surround', 'sound', 'system', 'really', 'put', 'track', 'test', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'can', 'be', 'much', 'improvement', '5.1', 'mix', 'original', 'DVD', 'do', 'think', 'could', 'follow', 'rapid', 'overlapping', 'better', 'used', 'probably', 'just', 'repeated', 'viewing', 'rather', 'real', 'technical', 'achievement', 'extras', 'were', 'ported', 'previous', 'disc', 'good', 'was', 'fairly', 'packed', 'two', 'disc', 'set', 'However', 'real', 'new', 'stuff', 'be', 'had', 'Overall', ""'m"", 'really', 'just', 'jonesing', 'see', 'how', 'McCabe', 'Mrs.', 'Miller', 'Brewster', 'McCloud', 'Nashville', 'hold', 'up', 'format', 'may', 'not', 'look', 'perfect', 'even', 'good', 'disc', 'just', 'what', 'little', 'TLC', 'can', 'do', 'towards', 'making', 'great', 'murky-looking', '70s', 'films', 'watchable', 'HD', 'sets']",M*A*S*H VHS

Robert Altman's movie begins with the army hospital in sync. Thechoppers bring the wounded into the hospital as the Johnny Mandel instrumental plays.Like a lot of war movies, the film gets right into action. There is more extensivemovie credits in the beginning of the movie than you normally see. ""Suicide Is Painless""is instantly identified as the movie theme. Movie themes have a special place in myheart, and sometimes directors don't use them. You get to see the same song performedat the Hawkeye's version of ""The Last Supper"". I don't really know if Hawkeyeorchestrated all that. The hi-jinx all were probably a combined effort of Trapper,Hawkeye, and Dr. Forrest. Anyhow, the whole memorial service thing had a reason. Tohelp a guy out with his ""Manowar"" stallion complex. What? Jawbreaker fail? In my opinion,the Dental Don Juan didn't need any help.MASH is R. I have to wonder, who were they protecting? Good movie to see if yousneaked some liquor into the theater, got drunk with friends, or the girlfriend,the wife, but no kids under 21. At least in your opinion. You don't want yourdescendants or your neighbor's kids there. That's the real reason you wanted to gowith a bunch of adults to see the movie about the 4077th. After 1956 videocassetteswent on sale. So you could go into the room where the set is and watch MASH againwith Junior. You could explain hypocrisy, or try, like why Major Burns is not a""godless be-fool"" but everyone else in the camp is. You could try to get pointersyourself on how to pick up women the way Duke Forrest does. The surgeon lacks realSouthern charm with the female staff. But he knows how to do meatball surgery withthe best.In all, there are roughly six different stories or chronicles in the Mash film, andyou should watch the movie several times before you select your favorites.

265701,A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM,6301777387,Stanley Crowe,"[0, 2]","Robert Altman's 1969 anarchic comedy still holds up very well.  Set during the Korean War and made during the Vietnam War, it's main comic focus is on the irrelevance of authority -- that, more than anything, caused it to resonate when it first came out, at a time when the public was beginning to realize that the political authorities prosecuting the Vietnam War were systematically deceiving the people with false body counts overseas and efforts to stifle dissent at home.  The movie depends on the good-heartedness and professional competence of the military doctors and nurses to let us see that authority has really nothing to do with whether or not the M*A*S*H unit is doing its job of saving lives and that in that basic human concern rank and hierarchy mean nothing.  Hawkeye's insistence on being addressed by his nickname even by ""subordinates"" is just one example of that.  Col. Blake's refusal to see that a M*A*S*H unit isn't simply ""the army""  drives him into hypocrisy and craziness -- he refuses to see that he is basically under the same pressures as his men, and when he is humiliated by being very publicly caught in a liaison with ""Hot Lips"" Houlihan he can't laugh it off and is carted away in straitjacket.  Houlihan, who starts as a stickler for order and discipline, is publicly humiliated twice -- and finally joins in the anarchic spirit, which means that she can go on doing what she's really good at: being a nurse.  So ironically, the anarchy is enabling and life-enhancing, not destructive.  Burns's replacement. Col. Blake, is presented as wise enough to turn a blind eye to all but the essentials, which here is simply keeping the field hospital going.The anarchic spirits are played by Donald Sutherland (Hawkeye), Elliott Gould (Trapper John), and Tom Skerritt (Duke), all in their golden youths.  Sally Kellerman is ""Hot Lips"" and Robert Duvall has in effect a cameo as the unfortunate Col. Burns -- he would have his own destructive anarchic time a little later in ""Apocalypse Now"" (""I love the smell of napalm in the morning . . ."").  All are marvelous.  Altman is also not afraid to play for some sheer old-fashioned Three-Stooges-like physical schtick (the MPs when Hawkeye steals the jeep, and the football game with the 325th), but grounding it all are the wounded bodies that the men work on -- not grossly presented but bloody enough to keep it real.None of that thematic stuff is articulated in the movie itself -- it's all rendered through action.  Were it to be made explicit, by having a character explain it all, the movie would become preachy and sanctimonious.  The TV series spun off from this movie was good but didn't always avoid sentimentality and sanctimony.  It's often said by pundits, especially on the right, that Americans have never recovered from the general lack of respect for authority that began to be questioned during the 1960s.  Arguably we haven't -- and arguably most of those who still set themselves up as moral authorities especially end up showing their hypocrisy or venality or pettiness.

265702,A3FDEI5P21XX6S,6301777387,"Steve Kuehl ""SLV Video""","[20, 20]","I have to be honest - this movie and resulting series both have an important hold on my memories of growing up and discovering what was going to make me laugh in watching TV. I also love BD and what it has done for our industry, so I went into this release with great expectations, and really, I was not disappointed (though it could always be better). If you already have the special edition that Altman cleaned up, this appears to be an identical transfer with no significant changes.The picture looks great compared to the original releases as most of the artifact has been removed and the color has been saturated extensively - but in a good way. There is an apparent softness throughout, but compared to what the original product was, I don't mind. The DTS was not the greatest, and the front three channels get all the work. I even tried the football game and some jeep scenes but nothing gets around to the rear channels much. The supplements are identical to the special edition release (roughly 5 hours of docus and extras on all the other DVD sets) with a couple exceptions here:* Still Gallery - 70 pics that had to be taken from the BD transfer as they are very crisp. Screen saver worthy.* Complete Interactive Guide: A fun tally on all things done by the characters. When activated, a headshot pic pops up while that person is on screen and a cumulative number appears referencing how many drinks or fights partaken, and/or court martials that should be happening. When there are large volumes of people on the screen the shots take up the whole top and bottom half of the set, but it helps keep track of who enters and leaves each scene. Worth doing once you have watched the film and have time to kill. Customers walking by the screening actually liked this option as it is a nice review of the supporting actors.There are subs in Spanish, Cantonese, Mandarin and Thai. Dubbed in Spanish and French with an English 2.0 option. A Portguese trailer was thrown in for good measure. Overall, the picture turned out nice and the sound better than before, and this would be a nice upgrade if you did not already get the other set. I noticed much more grain on a larger display but the smaller LCD panels showcased a solid preservation.

265706,A3U56M0Y8LYO6J,6301777387,"Steven Y. ""Pop Culture Addict""","[4, 10]","For the generation that grew up with the television series, ""MASH"" the film is a little disorienting.  Sure, all the names are familiar:  Hawkeye, Trapper John, Hot Lips, Frank Burns, Col. Blake, and Father Mulcahy.  Yet, the faces from your memory do not match the names.  The only recognizable face is that of Radar O'Reilly (Gary Burghoff).  It, therefore, becomes quickly apparent that the film is a completely different creature from the television series and must be judged on its own merits.  In that regard, ""MASH"" is a pretty good film.Robert Altman's film opens with with doctors ""Hawkeye"" Pierce (Donald Sutherland) and ""Duke"" Forrest (Tom Skerritt) arriving in Korea.  They are told to report to the MASH 4077th but can't find any available transportation.  They decide to steal a jeep to solve their problem and the fun begins.  Soon ""Trapper John"" McIntyre (Elliott Gould) arrives on the scene and the drinking, partying, and womanizing kicks into high gear.  Like the early seasons of the television series, the targets of most of the swampmates' practical jokes are the uptight duo of Major Frank Burns (Robert Duvall) and nurse ""Hot Lips"" Houlihan (Sally Kellerman).""MASH"" essentially is a series of comedy segments patched together to come up with the 116 minute running time.  Some of these segments are hilarious while others fall flat.  The shower tent victimizing of Hot Lips and the visit to Japan are probably the two high points of the film.  The film's satire also seems a little tame compared to today's standards.  When it is compared to the satire of the recent South Park film, you can see just how much edge the film has lost.  Yet, Altman has included enough quality material to keep you entertained.  Sutherland and Gould make a good comedy team and there's enough wackiness from beginning to end to keep a goofy grin on your face.  In terms of cultural impact, the film version of ""MASH"" will never match the legacy left behind by its television counterpart but it is still an amusing film taken on its own.",3,"""This isn't a hospital!

265707,A29RZ88ME47XEK,6301777387,Straight Shaun,"[20, 76]","Heresy or not, all I can say is that a large segment of today's population must be comprised of nostalgic, angry ex-hippies, if this film can still glow for so many when examined under modern light. The rampant, idiotic sexism and ill-natured tone of the film is just sickening, not because of any duty to political correctness, but for the simple reason that a jerk is a jerk, no matter what the era(!).  And this film really is shockingly ill-willed throughout.  Trapper and Hawkeye (not to mention Skeritt's stomach-turning Duke Forrest) have to be among the most repulsive ""protagonists"" you'll ever see.  They aren't just ""anti-authority"", as the spun marketing would have you believe, they are just complete, utter, cretins.  Seriously, before the movie's half over, you'll be HOPING they get shot or hit by a bomb or something.  It's beyond belief.  This is certainly in contrast to the TV show, which was terrifically good-natured while still managing to portray hellish war conditions, and which I think was light-years superior to this ""original"".  All of the hype aside, this film is just so ignorant and offensive (sexism, racism, the hateful and angry tone, etc.) that I think its main, if not only, fans are primarily those who grew up with the film and are conveniently blinded by nostalgia.  Its ""popularity"" (if it even really exists anymore) will be infathomable to most modern viewers.  It makes for ugly, distasteful viewing, on many counts.  And it reminded me why just about everyone I grew up with from my generation never looked up to most of our flower-child precursors except with a healthy chunk of disdain.  What a shame.Now that I write this review and actually notice this film's cover graphic for the first time instead of paying attention only to the endless lauding by reviewers, I have to admit: who can be surprised by any of this.

265710,A1K3NQAO49LXL2,6301777387,"Surferofromantica ""S.O.R.""","[2, 2]","The great Robert Altman film, and what an excitement to watch it again. Donald Sutherland is weird with his strange face and his lanky demeanor, Sally Kellerman is absurd as a regular army clown, Tom Skeritt is hard to take without his signature mustache (he seems out of place as a 4077th Swamp wise-ass) and Robert Duvall is a freaky Frank Burns. Best of all is Elliot Gould, the man who brings a jar of olives to Korea for his martinis. I love the classic scene where he drops an olive into a martini glass that is sitting on the ground of his tent. Nice scene when Margaret ""Hot Lips"" Houlihan is getting out of the helicopter, you get a view of her garters, then see her stand up straight to salute the commanding officer, before ducking down in order to not get decapitated by the chopper blades (Sally Kellerman did that stunt herself, by the way). Funny thing about Painless Paul's prick. The scenes in surgery are pure black comedy, with the cast murmuring and adlibbing while there's blood all over the linens. Great dialogue too:Hawkeye (to Hot Lips, after she's berated him for letting the nurses call him Hawkeye, etc.) Oh come off it, Major. You put me right off my fresh fried lobster, do you realize that? I'm now going to go back to my bed, I'm going to put away the best part of a bottle of scotch... And under normal circumstances, you being normally what I would call a very attractive woman, I would have invited you back to share my little bed with me and you might possibly have come. But you really put me off. I mean you... You're what we call a regular army clown.Hot Lips: I wonder how a degenerated person like that could have reached a level of responsibility in the medical corps.Father Mulcahey: He was drafted.Then there's the great scene where Frank and Hot Lips get together- God meant us to find each other.- His will be done.Mad necking and groping ensues. Hawkeye corners Frank on the matter, asks ""Was she better than self abuse?"" When Frank attacks Hawkeye, Trapper yells out ""Watch out for your goodies, Hawkeye, the man's a sex maniac. I don't think Hot Lips satisfied him. Don't let him kiss you."" Classic. The madness of Frank Burns, the pain of Painless Paul agonising of the ""latent homosexuality"" that he must expose his three fiancees back home to, the recreation of Michelangelo's Last Supper scene before curing Paul with a faked suicide, it's all aces.The movie goes so quickly through so many classic scenes that you think it's done its job only an hour in. But wait, there's more. The mystery of Hot Lips' hair - is she a real blonde (we can find out in so many ways). Then there's the great harangue ""This is not a hospital, this is an insane asylum."" The Japan scenes are hot, full of insubordinance, mock-bad dialogue, and fantastic irreverence (not to mention the umbrella fencing scene. Nobody spoke authentic Japanese (or Korean, for that matter). The story fills out with a football game, which includes some of the crappiest scenes of the movie, the only ones that are relatively plot-driven. Oh well. It's funny anyway - tokin' on the bench, general chaos, civil war on the field, it's a mini war that doesn't need Korea to produce injuries and lost lives. Funny scenes, like Father Mulcahey praying for the safety of each jeep, or ""Tokyo Shoeshine Boy"" coming over the loudspeakers.Then there's also a 20-minute documentary on the first disc, then three documentaries (40 minutes, 40 minutes, 30 minutes) on the second disc. Let's see if I can get to all of them.On the first disc there's an interesting documentary giving the background of the production. It seems like the director took out all references to Korea, even adding rice farmers hats from Vietnam into the crowd in some scenes. The film had a small budget, only $3.5 million, director Robert Altman only took $75,000. Twentieth Century Fox at the time had two other war films, each one more patriotic: ""Patton"" and ""Tora, Tora, Tora."" Altman kepta low profile while filming, and used new actors, or relatively unknown actors. Donald Sutherland had taken a small role in The Dirty Dozen, and Elliott Gould had been in a few pictures. Tom Skerrit had been with Altman in a few projects, the only actor who had previously worked with Altman. There is a great scene with Altman telling Sutherland at a party that the guy he plays calls himself Hawkeye. ""Hawkeye?"" the young Canadian asks. The role was good for Sutherland, who was struggling financially at the time, although he and Gould eventually went on to fight Altman with their agents and the studio. Altman used new actors and unknowns to keep his budget low, and he turned in the footage two days early and under-budget by $500,000. The documentary also has a screen test of Kim Atwood and Elliott Gould in 1969. ""A crazy camp, a mad set."" Mumbling in the background ""pushes journalism to its outer limits."" The zoom keeps actors on their toes, because you never know when you could ruin a shot, even if you're behind the scenes somewhat. The rift between Altman and Sutherland/Gould unwittingly led them to give great performances. Altman and Burghoff went naked for Sally. The studio was shocked at what they got, and the non-linear film needed a thread in the editing. They finally realised that they could use the speaker announcements to provide that, the wording of which comes from Korean war almanacs and military manuals. Ironically, the old-school screenwriter objected most to the film's release, due to the massive liberties taken with his script, but ended up being the only one to get an Oscar for the film.There were two long documentaries I didn't have time for, but I did watch the 30th Anniversary Cast reunion, which was good, although it didn't have Donald Sutherland. It's not very good, as it shows how nonchalantly they gave an award to Robert Altman (who looks exactly like he did when he was making M*A*S*H*), but it has some interesting lines. Seems like Altman hated the series, thought that it was racist. ""Everybody's a racist. We're all racists."" Apparently Michael Altman only wanted a guitar as payment for his involvement in the movie, but he got a contract after all and probably ended up making more money than his dad did.",5,The only one

265717,A3AUECYM0M0YSX,6301777387,The Man in the Hathaway Shirt,"[1, 1]","The other day it struck me what an incredible intellectual concept MASH is: a war movie without any combat, without a gun being fired onscreen (save for the referee's pistol in the football game), a movie about the futility of war where no one talks about the futility of war, a movie that protests Viet Nam without ever mentioning Viet Nam.  Has anyone else ever made such a daring and unconventional war film?MASH was the first time director Robert Altman made a rambling, ensemble piece without a storyline, but it was not his last. For many years, however, I could not figure out why I felt the approach worked so much better here than in other efforts, either by Altman or other directors.One day I realized the very simple answer--the structure, or *lack* of one, compliments the point of the story. Altman managed to make a film that showed the aimlessness, waste, and futility of war, without ever having a character SAY that the action they were involved in was aimless, wasteful and futile. Instead he SHOWED it, with a spontaneous camera technique and a script that (deliberately) went nowhere. (For all those who are bellowing ""There's no plot!"" some of the best films ever made and books ever written have no plot, at least in the conventional sense.)  It's as if he is saying our boys wasted two years of their lives over there (and were also then wasting years of their lives in Viet Nam, if they weren't losing them) and he showed this waste on the screen through the series of unconnected, seemingly pointeless stories--an example of form matching function perfectly. And that's the fundamental reason I think MASH is one of the great films of all time. Unlike films such as Thin Red Line, unlike the very TV series that came from this movie, there is no moralizing here, and no irony. It isn't needed, and would have brought the movie down.Also interesting is how many of the then-radical techniques have now become part of everyday film and TV language.  With ad-libbed dialogue, ""floating"" camera in the documentary style just gaining in popularity, and the absence of ""movie"" lighting (and probably move makeup for that matter), this film must have looked bold in 1970, although today you can see these techniques on everything from commercials to crime dramas.  True, some of the crude sexual humor and the obsession with ""bedding the nurses"" dates the film badly, and there are a few too many substories that deal with the obsession with reproductive organs.  I understand these were young men away from home for the first time, in a unit with young, attractive nurses, and it doesn't matter if you're married or engaged, what are you going to do between shifts?  Still, I think the one misfire is that Altman hit on the sex theme too repetitively.  There are times where the film is in danger of becoming insignificant and childish.But there are also some unforgettable moments: the first visit to the OR (shocking then and still shocking now), the moment where they face a critical blood shortage in the OR because of bureaucratic conflicts, the scene where Hawkeye and Trapper perform an operation to save a little Japanese-American baby, the vignette where Hawkeye is interviewed on the street by a TV reporter and says hi to his dad, or a few moments later where Ho-Jon is inducted into the Korean army, despite Hawkeye's crude attempt to keep him out.  *These* scenes speak out against war in a way that the preachiness of later anti-war films never could, and for this reason I think MASH is the best anti-war film, period.The DVD release is excellent.  For once, Fox must think they're Criterion.  You get a beautifully-restored film (soundtrack is as good as can be expected for the time) and lots of goodies: not one but several documentaries, of varying quality. There is a lot of overlap--some of the interviews are the same in each--and they probably were not all necessary, but I'd rather have too many extras than not enough. One documentary has a lot of material on the real Korean War and shows actual MASH unit footage that you can compare to the movie. There's even a featurette that contrasts the restored print of MASH with the faded original. The final program, a cast reunion 30 years later in which Altman is given an award by Fox, is the weakest, but it's amusing to see that at 64, Sally Kellerman thinks she can still dress like a 22-year-old. (She almost gets away with it; she's had so much plastic surgery it's amazing she doesn't melt under the lights.)  We also get an ""Easter Egg"" that I didn't find until I owned this disc quite a while--if you right-click a bit with your remote on the first disc, you'll get an icon of a helicopter without explanation.  Click on it for a trailer to the movie in Portugese.  Finally, there's a *booklet* with an essay tucked in the box that reveals even more details not dealt with in the supplements!  A *booklet!*  I thought only Criterion did booklets!The only dud is the director's commentary track:  Altman is dull, and just about everything he says here he's already said in the aforementioned documentaries.  Commentaries from others (Gould, Sutherland, Kellerman, etc.) interspersed with the Altman comments are needed, because there are *long* pauses between Altman's statements, and he repeats things even within the commentary.  (""As I've said before..."")  Still, this is the definitive MASH.  More recently, Fox has reissued it again in a Gold Box packaging as part of the ""Award Collection.""  It's the same set as this release; only the color of the box is changed.  Get whatever version is cheapest, and you'll be satisfied to know you're getting the most comprehensive edition of MASH on home video you could ask for.",5,Form and function meet perfectly in this

M*A*S*H was actually a great American movie, in fact, one of the best, before it turned into that sappy, melodramatic, crap fest it turned into on seventies TV. I have suggested this movie to my peers, countless times, only to be responded with countless groans...""Wally, c'mon.. don't make us watch this..""Oh man! You guys are all missing out. This movie is awesome! It is a comedy all the way, but it is a film also. Worthy of the academy.. and it's kick ass! Sharp and slick, and as another reviewer stated a few spots down, much to my delight.. offensive.Now I know how some of you feel. I was forced to watch countless hours of the TV show when I was a kid. I hated it. Oh man, did I hate that show. I figured I'd hate the movie too, but I was way wrong. I first saw this film when I was around twelve, and instantly became a fan.First of all the cast is stellar. And the characters are a lot different. Donald Sutherland plays a much cooler Hawkeye than Alan Alda ever could. Ditto Robert Duvall as Frank... and Elliot Gould as Trapper. The TV show didn't even have Trapper for more than a season, he was replaced by B.J... What a geek that guy was! Lets not forget Tom Skerrit, and Sally Kellerman.. the REAL ""HotLips"" Houllihan...Exhibit Two: The theme song. How many nights have you turned off your TV, just because you can't bare to hear that awful theme song. Well, it's actually a song called ""Suicide is Painless"".. which actually has lyrics, and is actually a pretty great theme song to the movie. A little bit deppressing, but also a little inspirational at the same time.Exhibit three: The book. Based on true stories from a man who was actually in a MASH unit during the Korean War. Richard Hooker. He despised the TV show as much as you and me. He considered it a disgrace towards his own work. I couldn't agree more. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE!!!

However, some parts of this movie were just a little weird. One particular example is when the base dentist wants to commit suicide.

265735,AMMEMPM9MPS55,6301777387,www.DavidLRattigan.com,"[0, 1]","The title song sums up perfectly the mood of the film:The game of life is hard to play;I'm going to lose it anyway;The losing card I'll someday lay;So this is all I have to say:Suicide is painless;It brings on many changes;And I can take or leave it if I please.The only way to win is cheatAnd lay it down before I'm beat;And to another give my seatFor that's the only painless feat.Suicide is painless;It brings on many changes;And I can take or leave it if I please.And you can do the same thing if you please.Robert Altman's seminal film gives us an inside look at how a group of surgeons at a military base during the Korean War cope with the reality of conflict and human violence. Suicide is an apt metaphor for the stepping outside of conventions (the American way, authority and regulations, morality) the soldiers undertake in order to deal with the harshness of war. They choose anonymity, opting to forget the outside world, instead forming their own society, the mechanics of which eschew authority and convention. Altman's characters lay aside obligations, loyalties, and traditional codes of conduct. Along with them, we almost forget that these are men with families and histories; that is, until the final moments when they, along with us, are abruptly brought back to reality as they prepare to leave and go back to 'ordinary life'.The movie plays like a series of variations on this theme, many of the film's episodes functioning as allegories of human conflict and its corollaries. It certainly doesn't major on plot, but rather is sustained by a host of interesting characters, sharp and often hilarious dialogue and excellent performances. Altman brings a certain naturalism out of his actors, and impeccable timing in the more comedic moments.It would be a mistake, however, to see the comedy as a trivializing of violence and death. On the contrary, this is a deeply serious film, whose tone is clear from the outset, where Johnny Mandel's melancholy rhythms and harmonies suggest pain beneath the comedic exterior. Throughout the film, tragedy is never far from laughter. Comedy has always been the vehicle of serious comment. So it is with M*A*S*H. Not only is the absurdity of war itself brilliantly satirized, but Altman takes a poke at how Hollywood has dealt with the subject. The score frequently recalls the kind of stirring, patriotic tunes heard in old war movies, only to offset the effect by highlighting the farce of war, smashing false notions of glory and romance to pieces. This is a highly introspective film, and several of Altman's touches are there to remind us of the power of film, and perhaps the responsibility upon the shoulders of film-makers. There are frequent references to the old war movies, reminding us that M*A*S*H, at least in the eyes of its makers, stands in a different category together, a new subset of the war genre.It will be up to the viewer to decide whether Altman's new treatment of the themes of war and violence is really any more truthful than those of a few decades earlier. Some have found M*A*S*H merely offensive. Others have found it refreshing and astute in its perceptions. Watch it and decide for yourself.",4,Suicide is Painless,1025222400,"06 28, 2002",2002,3186,"['title', 'song', 'sums', 'up', 'perfectly', 'mood', 'film', 'game', 'life', 'hard', 'play', ""'m"", 'going', 'lose', 'anyway', 'losing', 'card', ""'ll"", 'someday', 'lay', 'So', 'have', 'say', 'Suicide', 'painless', 'many', 'changes', 'can', 'take', 'leave', 'please.The', 'only', 'way', 'win', 'cheatAnd', 'lay', 'down', ""'m"", 'beat', 'give', 'seatFor', 'only', 'painless', 'feat.Suicide', 'painless', 'many', 'changes', 'can', 'take', 'leave', 'please.And', 'can', 'do', 'same', 'thing', 'please.Robert', 'Altman', 'seminal', 'film', 'inside', 'look', 'how', 'group', 'surgeons', 'military', 'base', 'Korean', 'War', 'cope', 'reality', 'conflict', 'human', 'violence', 'Suicide', 'apt', 'metaphor', 'stepping', 'outside', 'conventions', 'American', 'way', 'authority', 'regulations', 'morality', 'soldiers', 'undertake', 'order', 'deal', 'harshness', 'war', 'choose', 'anonymity', 'opting', 'forget', 'outside', 'world', 'instead', 'forming', 'own', 'society', 'mechanics', 'eschew', 'authority', 'convention', 'Altman', 'characters', 'lay', 'aside', 'obligations', 'loyalties', 'traditional', 'codes', 'conduct', 'almost', 'forget', 'are', 'men', 'families', 'histories', 'final', 'moments', 'when', 'are', 'abruptly', 'brought', 'back', 'reality', 'prepare', 'leave', 'go', 'back', ""'ordinary"", ""life'.The"", 'movie', 'plays', 'series', 'variations', 'theme', 'many', 'film', 'episodes', 'functioning', 'allegories', 'human', 'conflict', 'corollaries', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'major', 'plot', 'rather', 'sustained', 'host', 'interesting', 'characters', 'sharp', 'often', 'hilarious', 'dialogue', 'excellent', 'performances', 'Altman', 'certain', 'naturalism', 'actors', 'impeccable', 'timing', 'more', 'comedic', 'moments.It', 'would', 'be', 'mistake', 'however', 'see', 'comedy', 'trivializing', 'violence', 'death', 'contrary', 'deeply', 'serious', 'film', 'tone', 'clear', 'outset', 'where', 'Johnny', 'Mandel', 'melancholy', 'rhythms', 'harmonies', 'suggest', 'pain', 'comedic', 'exterior', 'film', 'tragedy', 'never', 'far', 'laughter', 'Comedy', 'always', 'been', 'vehicle', 'serious', 'comment', 'M*A*S*H.', 'Not', 'only', 'absurdity', 'war', 'brilliantly', 'satirized', 'Altman', 'poke', 'how', 'Hollywood', 'dealt', 'subject', 'score', 'frequently', 'kind', 'stirring', 'patriotic', 'tunes', 'heard', 'old', 'war', 'movies', 'only', 'offset', 'effect', 'highlighting', 'farce', 'war', 'smashing', 'false', 'notions', 'glory', 'romance', 'pieces', 'highly', 'introspective', 'film', 'several', 'Altman', 'touches', 'are', 'there', 'remind', 'power', 'film', 'perhaps', 'responsibility', 'shoulders', 'film-makers', 'are', 'frequent', 'references', 'old', 'war', 'movies', 'reminding', 'M*A*S*H', 'least', 'eyes', 'makers', 'stands', 'different', 'category', 'together', 'new', 'subset', 'war', 'genre.It', 'will', 'be', 'up', 'viewer', 'decide', 'Altman', 'new', 'treatment', 'themes', 'war', 'violence', 'really', 'more', 'truthful', 'few', 'decades', 'earlier', 'have', 'found', 'M*A*S*H', 'merely', 'offensive', 'Others', 'have', 'found', 'refreshing', 'astute', 'perceptions', 'Watch', 'decide']",M*A*S*H VHS
