He was a Polish director of cartoons and in France he made some films like Immoral Tales. One of the tales became interesting and they decided to make a film with the idea of a beast, this beast became a  kind of metaphor of masculinity and voyeurism.

I am a self-professed film geek, and I had never heard of this obscure Polish director until I purchased this 3-disc limited edition of ""The Beast"" on a whim. Billed as an 'erotic' updating of ""Beauty And The Beast"", this 1974 gothic soaper mixes the unsettling sexual pathos of ""Equus"" with the bestial Freudian imagery of ""The Company of Wolves"". I think it is significant to note that this film was released the same year as ""Emmanuelle""; it utilizes a silmilar soft-focus Bob Guccione style of eroticism. The first hour of the film may try your patience, with it's poor-man's ""Upstairs Downstairs"" intrigues set at a crumbling French manor; but it is basically padding leading up to the film's infamous (and 'controversial', according to package notes) erotic dream sequence/frolic in the forest that takes up the final 20 minutes. Some reviewers have referred to this portion of the film as 'hardcore', but since the sequence in question stars a prosthetic about as 'realistic' as Mark Wahlberg's ""Boogie Nights"" enhancement, as well as other, er, 'special effects', can this he technically defined as 'pornographic'? (Discuss.). The 2004 limited edition (10,000 numbered copies) features a director's cut, a 'newly discovered' slightly longer version, and a third disc of interviews and 'making of' featurettes.

673257,A2BPDFR58H9575,B00005OW2P,Galina,"[3, 4]","Another variation and improvisation on the famous and beloved children tale, La Bete (1975) aka The Beast tries to imagine (in very graphic and what may seem offensive and disturbing but in reality rather silly and comical way), what actually happened between Beauty and the Beast? I am amused by many reviews and comments that seem to look too deeply into this movie. I would not go so far as saying that it is a serious and dark exploration of such subjects as sexual frustration, longing, fulfillment, or satirical criticizing of the catholic Religion. I would not even call it a horror-erotic movie. It's more of the parody on all genres it touches or mentions even though it's got some shocking moments in all departments that sure will stay in your memory.The long (way too long) scene between an Aristocratic young woman and the supposedly horrifying but the most laughable I've ever seen in the movies creature with truly impressive...well anatomy, is set to the clavichord music of Scarlatti and is hysterical. My husband and I both laughed out loud at the exaggerated details of the encounter. The moral of the scene is - beauty can and will defeat the monster. The question is - who is the target audience for the film? For an erotic picture, it is too verbose; for an art movie - it's got too many jaw-dropping scenes of sheer madness and I'd say an abrupt ending. IMO, the film creator did not mean for it to be a serious drama. As a parody of art house/horror/erotica, it is funny and certainly original. Have a good laugh and try not to look for some deep meaning. This story of the curious Beauties and the lustful Beasts certainly is not recommended for co-viewing with the children.

My latest disappointment is Borowczyk's THE BEAST.  It pretty easy to see which scenes contained the original footage and which were added to bring the film up to feature length.I liked the original scenes, but found the added footage a rather dull elongation of the basic theme.  And it certainly doesn't take an Einstein to figure out the conclusion.A young girl, along with her mother, arrive at the villa of a seedy count whose only son seems to be girl shy.  Around this point we see flashbacks about a female ancestor of the Count who was raped by a strange beast------who looks like a cross between a bear and a gorilla.  The flashbacks showing the beast chasing the Countess and ejaculating constantly at the sight of her, take up most of the original footage.  Oddly, if the struggles of the Countess to get away from the beast had been calculated to arouse him further, they couldn't have hit the mark any better.  Regrettably for the future, the countess finds the beast is the man for her and excites him to a marathon encounter in the woods.  Meanwhile, in the present, the son constantly keeps one hand bandaged with the excuse that he had an accident.  Ahhh, the sins of the mothers.OK.  It's different.

""A New Yorker""","[11, 13]","If, like me, you like your films to be unique, and unlike the majority of other movies, then I wholly recommend that you check out The Beast. The film is a grotesque, erotic, fantasy fairytale that centers around a mythological 'Beast' that is rumored to wander the grounds of a French mansion and lusts after women. The film is very daring with it's subject material, and that is something to give it credit for. The theme of bestiality is a definite taboo, and for good reason, I might add; but the film conveys it; straight and to the point. Like other films that handle a taboo subject at their center, The Beast could have gone around it, and made us use our imagination to fill in the gaps, but Borowczyk didn't do that, and he is brave in that respect, especially as making a film like this will leave him open to all kinds of criticisms, but the fact that he went ahead with it, in my view, means a big thumbs up for the guy.Many criticize the scenes around the film's shocking sex sequences for being boring, but these scenes are important to the film's story. Without these scenes, we wouldn't get to know the characters or the story of the beast, and, most importantly; the story of 'beauty and the beast' would not be able to have it's horrifying conclusion dealt to the audience, and as that is one of the key elements of the film; it would be a real shame. Besides that, Borowczyk keeps his audience entertained through these scenes, not with shocks, but with dialogue and the upper class persona of the family, along with the beautiful shots of the mansion's ground would not be seen, and therefore the stark contrast between that and the events later on in the film would not exist either.Overall, The Beast is a shocking film. It's portrayal of a taboo subject and the shocking way it is portrayed will ensure that this film is not for everyone. However, if you can get over the film's shock, and embrace The Beast; what awaits is a skillful and beautiful piece of art that should not be missed by anyone that is willing to give this film a chance.",3,"The images on this film is  wild, perverse, and strange.",1138492800,"01 29, 2006",2006,2065,"['films', 'be', 'unique', 'majority', 'other', 'movies', 'then', 'wholly', 'recommend', 'check', 'out', 'Beast', 'film', 'grotesque', 'erotic', 'fantasy', 'fairytale', 'centers', 'mythological', ""'Beast"", 'rumored', 'wander', 'grounds', 'French', 'mansion', 'lusts', 'women', 'film', 'very', 'daring', 'subject', 'material', 'something', 'give', 'credit', 'theme', 'bestiality', 'definite', 'taboo', 'good', 'reason', 'might', 'add', 'film', 'conveys', 'straight', 'point', 'other', 'films', 'handle', 'taboo', 'subject', 'center', 'Beast', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'made', 'use', 'imagination', 'fill', 'gaps', 'Borowczyk', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'brave', 'respect', 'especially', 'making', 'film', 'will', 'leave', 'open', 'kinds', 'criticisms', 'fact', 'went', 'ahead', 'view', 'big', 'thumbs', 'up', 'guy.Many', 'criticize', 'scenes', 'film', 'shocking', 'sex', 'sequences', 'being', 'boring', 'scenes', 'are', 'important', 'film', 'story', 'scenes', 'would', ""n't"", 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'story', 'beast', 'most', 'importantly', 'story', ""'beauty"", 'beast', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'have', 'horrifying', 'conclusion', 'dealt', 'audience', 'one', 'key', 'elements', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'real', 'shame', 'Borowczyk', 'audience', 'entertained', 'scenes', 'not', 'shocks', 'dialogue', 'upper', 'class', 'persona', 'family', 'beautiful', 'shots', 'mansion', 'ground', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'seen', 'therefore', 'stark', 'contrast', 'events', 'later', 'film', 'would', 'not', 'exist', 'either.Overall', 'Beast', 'shocking', 'film', 'portrayal', 'taboo', 'subject', 'shocking', 'way', 'portrayed', 'will', 'ensure', 'film', 'not', 'everyone', 'However', 'can', 'get', 'film', 'shock', 'embrace', 'Beast', 'what', 'skillful', 'beautiful', 'piece', 'art', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'anyone', 'willing', 'give', 'film', 'chance']",The Beast

673263,A3GKPMHV4U64IY,B00005OW2P,Joshua Koppel,"[7, 10]","Said to be a retelling of Beauty and the Beast, I have to say that while there is a beauty and a beast, there is no curse mentioned.  This is a very strange tale that takes place in two different time periods.  In the present we have a planned wedding between and noble and an American girl.  In the flashes of the past, we see a young virgin ravished by the title creature.  These flashes are given in a way that they might be dreams of the American girl.Other than the American girl most of the characters are very strange.  We have the father who shaves the son and then baptizes him in secret.  We have the priest who allows the baptism and kisses his alter boys.  The girl's mother does an astounding change of personality and rips the clothes off of another character.  The son is strange in more ways than I can describe.  There is no explanation given for the beast or any real connection to the present.  It is not even known if it is real or a fanciful dream explanation.  Whatever the case, the beast is literally fornicated to death during these flashes.  The American girl, while having her dreams, keeps trying to sneak into the bedroom of her intended, but keeps getting scared away.In the end we have a strange film that seems to have had little point than to try and get by the censors.  Although the story takes place at a grand estate almost everything happens in two small rooms.  Once the film was over I found myself wondering just what was supposed to be conveyed to the audience.  The lack of substance made it almost qualify as a psychedelic film.  There is plenty in this film that could offend viewers from the opening scenes of horses mating to the antics of the beast himself.

673265,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,B00005OW2P,K. Driscoll,"[21, 22]","Walerian Borowczyk's explicit and insane la Bte (The Beast) is a directly adult reflection of the sexual undertones in many fairy tales.  There are segments in la Bte that are unflinching enough to be deemed pornographic but they are done in such a silly and shocking way we cannot assume that Borowcyzk's goals are to titillate.  I mean come on, the film opens with a close-up of a female horse's private parts and a male horse jumps right into the mix soon thereafter.  There is also a tremendous amount of (human) nudity in la Bte and while gratuitous, it does seem to be appropriate within the film, even though it isn't necessarily erotic.  I don't think it is possible to categorize this movie and that in and of itself is a strength for me.  From beginning to end, I had no idea what to expect.The film takes place in the Esperance house that is awaiting a wedding between the family's son and Lucy.  The family is full of chaos and everyone seems to have something to hide.  Lucy becomes fascinated with the family's notorious ancestor Romilda, who apparently had a sexual encounter that Lucy reads about with a very well endowed beast in the woods nearby.  Lucy imagines the experience Romilda went through graphically, and she almost seems to fantasize about the ordeal.  We see the sequence almost in its entirety.  It consists of Romilda (Sirpa Lane) running around gradually losing her clothes with some harpsichord music playing and eventually she succumbs to the beast's advances and gets it on with his giant prosthetic phallus.  It is graphic enough that it would be nearly impossible to say it isn't shocking, but it is funny enough that the audience will laugh uncomfortably until it concludes.  You certainly won't forget this sequence and there are several more memorable parts before and after.Just because someone may care I won't reveal how la Bte ends.  Walerian Borowcyzk actually does seem to have a way with making movies.  His other films are for the most part straight-forward erotica but he has the ability to make beautiful shots and here he even puts together an interesting, albeit strictly comedic, commentary on human and animal sexual impulse.  I don't want to mislead anyone here; the priorities of this movie are by no means it's potentially significant insights.  I don't know what Borowcyzk's intentions are but la Bte is certainly one of a kind.The Cult Epics three disc release is worth owning if you enjoy rare and unique films.  Especially ones that push the limit like this one.  We have the dubbed version and the director's cut in here, as well as a great stills gallery and a hilarious trailer that shows almost the entire sequence with the beast and Sirpa Lane, but with a black bar over the graphic footage...as if we don't know what could be happening.  On the third disc we have over one hundred minutes of silent behind the scenes footage and several other interesting features.  The book that comes with this edition is probably the best aspect of the Cult Epics release.  It has stills of some of the more noteworthy content and explains the film in far better detail than I have.  This is recommended for collectors and definitely for those of us not easily offended.",3,Extremely Bizarre Cult Film,1185148800,"07 23, 2007",2007,3224,"['Walerian', 'Borowczyk', 'explicit', 'insane', 'la', 'Bte', 'Beast', 'directly', 'adult', 'reflection', 'sexual', 'undertones', 'many', 'fairy', 'tales', 'are', 'segments', 'la', 'Bte', 'are', 'unflinching', 'enough', 'be', 'deemed', 'pornographic', 'are', 'done', 'such', 'silly', 'shocking', 'way', 'can', 'not', 'assume', 'Borowcyzk', 'goals', 'are', 'titillate', 'mean', 'come', 'film', 'close-up', 'female', 'horse', 'private', 'parts', 'male', 'horse', 'jumps', 'right', 'mix', 'soon', 'thereafter', 'also', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'human', 'nudity', 'la', 'Bte', 'gratuitous', 'seem', 'be', 'appropriate', 'film', 'even', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'erotic', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'possible', 'categorize', 'movie', 'strength', 'beginning', 'end', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'expect.The', 'film', 'place', 'Esperance', 'house', 'awaiting', 'wedding', 'family', 'son', 'Lucy', 'family', 'full', 'chaos', 'everyone', 'have', 'something', 'hide', 'Lucy', 'fascinated', 'family', 'notorious', 'ancestor', 'Romilda', 'who', 'apparently', 'had', 'sexual', 'encounter', 'Lucy', 'very', 'well', 'endowed', 'beast', 'woods', 'nearby', 'Lucy', 'experience', 'Romilda', 'went', 'graphically', 'almost', 'fantasize', 'ordeal', 'see', 'sequence', 'almost', 'entirety', 'Romilda', 'Sirpa', 'Lane', 'running', 'around', 'gradually', 'losing', 'clothes', 'harpsichord', 'music', 'playing', 'eventually', 'beast', 'advances', 'giant', 'prosthetic', 'phallus', 'graphic', 'enough', 'would', 'be', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'say', ""n't"", 'shocking', 'funny', 'enough', 'audience', 'will', 'laugh', 'uncomfortably', 'certainly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'forget', 'sequence', 'are', 'several', 'more', 'memorable', 'parts', 'after.Just', 'someone', 'may', 'care', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'how', 'la', 'Bte', 'Walerian', 'Borowcyzk', 'actually', 'seem', 'have', 'way', 'making', 'movies', 'other', 'films', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'straight-forward', 'erotica', 'ability', 'make', 'beautiful', 'shots', 'here', 'even', 'together', 'interesting', 'albeit', 'strictly', 'comedic', 'commentary', 'human', 'animal', 'sexual', 'impulse', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'mislead', 'anyone', 'here', 'priorities', 'movie', 'are', 'means', 'potentially', 'significant', 'insights', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'Borowcyzk', 'intentions', 'are', 'la', 'Bte', 'certainly', 'one', 'kind.The', 'Cult', 'Epics', 'three', 'disc', 'release', 'worth', 'owning', 'enjoy', 'rare', 'unique', 'films', 'Especially', 'ones', 'push', 'limit', 'one', 'have', 'dubbed', 'version', 'director', 'cut', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'great', 'stills', 'gallery', 'hilarious', 'trailer', 'almost', 'entire', 'sequence', 'beast', 'Sirpa', 'Lane', 'black', 'bar', 'graphic', 'footage', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'happening', 'third', 'disc', 'have', 'over', 'one', 'hundred', 'minutes', 'silent', 'scenes', 'footage', 'several', 'other', 'interesting', 'features', 'book', 'edition', 'probably', 'best', 'aspect', 'Cult', 'Epics', 'release', 'stills', 'more', 'noteworthy', 'content', 'film', 'far', 'better', 'detail', 'have', 'recommended', 'collectors', 'definitely', 'not', 'easily', 'offended']",The Beast

If it is done well there is nothing better to read or watch. This movie is not a retelling of ""Beauty and the Beast"" as its title and premise would indicate. I own several versions of ""Beauty and the Beast"" on DVD and in print. And after reading the reviews here I was really looking forward to adding this movie to my collection and I was excited to have the chance to watch this movie. I thought it was going to be great! BUT IT IS THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER PURCHASED. I was prepared for the horses and I was prepared for the nudity and the eroticism. I was not prepared for the filmmaker's mangling of ""Beauty and the Beast"".  That is what the blurb on the box suggests. But instead of getting the Beauty and the Beast message of the redeeming power of love, you get a half-hearted sermon against bestiality. I didn't know that was such a problem in this world. I mean I have never had the urge and I don't know of anyone who has. There have been no reports on the news about people sexually assaulting livestock that I have heard. I am sure I would have heard something if such was the case. There is no excuse for what Borowczyk has done here.

673273,A36L47A45ZF3WP,B00005OW2P,"R. Grubb ""Malevolent Child""","[11, 12]","I understand completely why some people would hate this movie, as is evidenced in the negative reviews.  But this is one of those what-you-see-is-what-you-get deals, so I can't understand why these people would look at the cover art, and read the back, which describes, ""a beast possessed by a giant phallus and an insatiable lust,"" and say to themselves, ""now that sounds like the feel-good hit of the year!""  If ""giant phallus"" and ""insatiable lust"" is not something you want to see, then please don't watch this movie, because they aren't fooling around.The opening scene depicts horses mating, and it's painfully real.  I'm not exactly sure why the director wanted to open the movie that way.  And like many others have expressed, it's not something I really want to see, sex film or not, but I have to give him props, if only because it must have been very difficult to film!  How do you direct animals mating?  ""Cut!  Back up a minute, I'm not believing it!""The story is an erotic take on the Beauty and the Beast tale.  An American heiress, Lucy, travels to Paris to meet with her arranged fiance so that they can marry and produce an heir.  The version I saw was a 3 disc special edition with a newly recovered complete version of the film with four minutes of extra dialog.  Gee, it's a good thing they found that, because I'm sure that is exactly what fans of this movie wanted to see--more dialog!  Lucy finds the diary of the Lady of the house from the 18th century, in which she describes being attacked by a beast living in the woods.  And you know what's so special about this beast...While Lucy is in bed feeling lonely, since she can't marry her new husband until tomorrow, she imagines what happened that day in the woods.  We see a woman in a powdered wig being chased by what looks like a guy in a grizzly bear costume with a giant you-know-what protruding out the front of him.  It seems that his problem is that he ejactulates over and over again, and never goes limp, hence the ""insatiable lust.""Lucy's fiance, Mathuin, is feeling insecure about meeting her, because he feels ugly.  He should really relax, because a woman who fantasizes about doing it with a ""beast"" isn't too particular about physical appearance.  He sends a rose to her bedroom, which she makes use of in her nether regions.  This didn't look like such a sexy idea to me, what with all the thorns and everything.  But she's careful, and only uses the petals.  The tight closeups mostly keep everything obscured by the petals, but offer breif glimpses of her womanhood.  I appreciated that, just because I could imagine the no-lifers who rent this pervy thing rewinding, freeze framing, and getting more and more frustrated, until they realize they should just have stuck with the back room for their viewing pleasure.  They could have their choice of DVD's that don't get convoluted with all the other garbage contained in ""La Bete,"" that us more evolved members of the human race like to call, ""story.""While all this is going on, we flash back to the woman in the woods.  After being attacked, and taken by force, she changes course, and begins pleasuring the beast in a variety of ways.  Her change in attitude is not sudden, and if you watch the actress, you can actually see it happen gradually.  If this sounds disturbing, that's because it is.  But I find it to be a very interesting reading of Beauty and The Beast.  While the fairy tale has become a story of a female who learns to see inner beauty in a male she initially finds hideous, (while being valued mainly for her physical beauty by the male) it can also be interpreted as a story of sadism.  A female has an undesirable situation forced upon her until she learns to embrace it.As I'm watching the beast and the woman perform every sex act in graphic detail, I'm not sure what I'm supposed to think of it.  Is it supposed to be funny?  Erotic?  Scary?  Shocking?  I don't know.  But I've always enjoyed erotic horror movies from the 70's that are neither sexy nor scary for reasons I can't explain.I'll probably never watch La Bete again.  Although I would recommend it, provided you're into this kind of thing, and you know what you're getting yourself into.

673276,A145B8OHVNNFAJ,B00005OW2P,Steward Willons,"[11, 13]","""La Bete"" has a reputation as a classic erotic art film, but I'm not entirely convinced that it is in fact art. Walerian Borowszyk got his start in animation and I believe that's where he built his reputation. Later in life, he began direction films, but they tended to be fairly straightforward European softcore films that may possess artistic pretension, but not necessarily artistic quality.Borowszyk's films sometimes evoke the feelings of classic literature with a degree of sophistication. During some of the more explicit scenes, one sometimes gets the same sense of high-brow decadence found in the more scandalous, but classic literature. Unfortunately, Borowszyk doesn't know when to stop and frequently shows up things that are unnecessary. Certain images are powerful, but then he'll cheapen the effect by showing us things from a different angle, if you understand what I'm saying. We can deal with these taboo issues, but we don't need to see them in the type of detail Borowszyk is often happy to provide. I get the sense that he's trying to make an art film, but is just too self-indulgent to abide by the bounds of good taste.I understand that this story is deeply perverse and deals with ""unspeakable"" acts of transgression. That part doesn't offend me. It's the manner in which Borowsczyk approaches these issues. The Beauty and the Beast idea is almost skillfully developed in the first two thirds of the film, but inevitably we must actually witness an encounter between the two and it is there that we see the beast is actually a guy in a cheesy, generic, hairy monster costume with one important (and pronounced) addition. If that's not enough, we then witness the two in a variety of positions borrowed straight from much lesser films.Ultimately, I see Borowsczyk in the same way I see Tinto Brass. Brass will develop a very sensual environment, but then he'll indulge himself by showing more detail than necessary, or by showing something from either an improbable angle, or from an improbable situation. Borowsczyk has a similar problem with restraint, as if he doesn't know when to stop. There's no doubt - Tinto Brass is an auteur with a consistent stylistic output, but he's not a master or a great filmmaker by any stretch. If Borowsczyk ever had an artistic sense, he has since discarded it in favor of pursuing his obsessions.The three-disc set would naturally seem like the way to go since more is better, right? In this case, more is not better. The middle disc contains the special features including the massively long ""Beast Bis"", billed as a behind-the-scenes documentary. It's actually just an collection of all sorts of behind-the-scenes film that plays continuously with no chapter index, no explanations of what we're seeing, and no sound. That's right, no sound at all. The footage is grainy, often out of focus, and dull. The cameraman is often filming nothing but the set while things are supposedly happening elsewhere. Maybe we get to see some rehearsals and out takes, but who can say? There's no sound to help us understand what we're seeing! I highly doubt anyone can sit through it. There's also a brief interview with Walerian Borowczyk, but it's mostly him talking extremely slow and not saying much that we didn't already know.The third disc contains the ""complete version"", as opposed to the director's cut on the first disc. The complete version hasn't been remastered and it looks just awful. The frames jump around and grit obscures the images. It's pretty painful to watch, and seeing as there's only a four minute difference, most viewers will decide it's not worth their time. Besides, it's not like anything was trimmed to get an ""R"" rating in the director's cut. From what I can tell, there's a little extra dialogue, and a few of the more boring scenes go on just a little bit longer. The director cut these four minutes for a reason.""La Bete"" has some deep flaws, but it's also worth seeing at least once, provided you're okay with some of the images contained within. This not a film for everyone and those with delicate tastes would do well to avoid this. It's interesting look at one of the classic acts of transgression, but even if its motives are entirely pure, it doesn't quite work. I would recommend renting this before you consider buying it. If you do decide to add it to your collection, I would also recommend the single disc version since the extra features and alternate edition have essentially nothing of interest.",3,A classic with an undeserved reputation - 2.5 stars,1217203200,"07 28, 2008",2008,4497,"['La', 'Bete', 'reputation', 'classic', 'erotic', 'art', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'entirely', 'convinced', 'fact', 'art', 'Walerian', 'Borowszyk', 'got', 'start', 'animation', 'believe', 'where', 'built', 'reputation', 'Later', 'life', 'began', 'direction', 'films', 'tended', 'be', 'fairly', 'straightforward', 'European', 'softcore', 'films', 'may', 'possess', 'artistic', 'pretension', 'not', 'necessarily', 'artistic', 'quality.Borowszyk', 'films', 'sometimes', 'evoke', 'feelings', 'classic', 'literature', 'degree', 'sophistication', 'more', 'explicit', 'scenes', 'one', 'sometimes', 'same', 'sense', 'high-brow', 'decadence', 'found', 'more', 'scandalous', 'classic', 'literature', 'Unfortunately', 'Borowszyk', ""n't"", 'know', 'when', 'stop', 'frequently', 'up', 'things', 'are', 'unnecessary', 'Certain', 'images', 'are', 'powerful', 'then', ""'ll"", 'cheapen', 'effect', 'showing', 'things', 'different', 'angle', 'understand', 'what', ""'m"", 'saying', 'can', 'deal', 'taboo', 'issues', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'see', 'type', 'detail', 'Borowszyk', 'often', 'happy', 'provide', 'get', 'sense', 'trying', 'make', 'art', 'film', 'just', 'too', 'self-indulgent', 'abide', 'bounds', 'good', 'taste.I', 'understand', 'story', 'deeply', 'perverse', 'deals', 'unspeakable', 'acts', 'transgression', 'part', ""n't"", 'offend', 'manner', 'Borowsczyk', 'issues', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'idea', 'almost', 'skillfully', 'developed', 'first', 'two', 'thirds', 'film', 'inevitably', 'must', 'actually', 'witness', 'encounter', 'two', 'there', 'see', 'beast', 'actually', 'guy', 'cheesy', 'generic', 'hairy', 'monster', 'costume', 'one', 'important', 'pronounced', 'addition', 'not', 'enough', 'then', 'witness', 'two', 'variety', 'positions', 'borrowed', 'straight', 'much', 'lesser', 'films.Ultimately', 'see', 'Borowsczyk', 'same', 'way', 'see', 'Tinto', 'Brass', 'Brass', 'will', 'develop', 'very', 'sensual', 'environment', 'then', ""'ll"", 'indulge', 'showing', 'more', 'detail', 'necessary', 'showing', 'something', 'improbable', 'angle', 'improbable', 'situation', 'Borowsczyk', 'similar', 'problem', 'restraint', ""n't"", 'know', 'when', 'stop', 'doubt', 'Tinto', 'Brass', 'auteur', 'consistent', 'stylistic', 'output', 'not', 'master', 'great', 'filmmaker', 'stretch', 'Borowsczyk', 'ever', 'had', 'artistic', 'sense', 'discarded', 'favor', 'pursuing', 'obsessions.The', 'three-disc', 'set', 'would', 'naturally', 'seem', 'way', 'go', 'more', 'better', 'right', 'case', 'more', 'not', 'better', 'middle', 'disc', 'special', 'features', 'including', 'massively', 'long', 'Beast', 'Bis', 'billed', 'behind-the-scenes', 'documentary', 'actually', 'just', 'collection', 'sorts', 'behind-the-scenes', 'film', 'continuously', 'chapter', 'index', 'explanations', 'what', ""'re"", 'seeing', 'sound', 'right', 'sound', 'footage', 'grainy', 'often', 'focus', 'dull', 'cameraman', 'often', 'filming', 'nothing', 'set', 'things', 'are', 'supposedly', 'happening', 'elsewhere', 'Maybe', 'get', 'see', 'rehearsals', 'who', 'can', 'say', 'sound', 'help', 'understand', 'what', ""'re"", 'seeing', 'highly', 'doubt', 'anyone', 'can', 'sit', 'also', 'brief', 'interview', 'Walerian', 'Borowczyk', 'mostly', 'talking', 'extremely', 'slow', 'not', 'saying', 'much', 'did', ""n't"", 'already', 'know.The', 'third', 'disc', 'complete', 'version', 'opposed', 'director', 'cut', 'first', 'disc', 'complete', 'version', ""n't"", 'been', 'remastered', 'just', 'awful', 'frames', 'jump', 'around', 'grit', 'images', 'pretty', 'painful', 'watch', 'seeing', 'only', 'four', 'minute', 'difference', 'most', 'viewers', 'will', 'decide', 'not', 'worth', 'time', 'not', 'anything', 'was', 'trimmed', 'get', 'R', 'rating', 'director', 'cut', 'what', 'can', 'tell', 'little', 'extra', 'dialogue', 'few', 'more', 'boring', 'scenes', 'go', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'longer', 'director', 'cut', 'four', 'minutes', 'reason', 'La', 'Bete', 'deep', 'flaws', 'also', 'worth', 'seeing', 'least', 'once', 'provided', ""'re"", 'okay', 'images', 'contained', 'not', 'film', 'everyone', 'delicate', 'tastes', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'avoid', 'interesting', 'look', 'one', 'classic', 'acts', 'transgression', 'even', 'motives', 'are', 'entirely', 'pure', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', 'would', 'recommend', 'renting', 'consider', 'buying', 'do', 'decide', 'add', 'collection', 'would', 'also', 'recommend', 'single', 'disc', 'version', 'extra', 'features', 'alternate', 'edition', 'have', 'essentially', 'nothing', 'interest']",The Beast
