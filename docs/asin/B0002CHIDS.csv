The gags are funny, but they could have been done by any other able bodied comedian of the time.  He HAD no character, and that is precisely the problem.  I still gave this set 4 stars because the prints are gorgeous, the films are fun, and they are definitely worth preserving (KINO does an amazing job).  My only negative comment has to do with Stan himself...who, if he wanted to continue as a performer, really needed Ollie a lot more than I'd realized.  As for Ollie, well, he more than likely would have continued as a wonderful comic supporting character actor, just as Eugene Pallete did (another Roach veteran).",4,"Everything is funny, but Stan.",1130371200,"10 27, 2005",2005,816,"[""'d"", 'have', 'go', 'pretty', 'far', 'find', 'more', 'devoted', 'Laurel', 'Hardy', 'fan', 'watched', 'great', 'collection', 'realized', 'Stan', 'wound', 'up', 'exactly', 'where', 'belonged', 'camera', 'gags', 'are', 'funny', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'other', 'able', 'bodied', 'comedian', 'time', 'HAD', 'character', 'precisely', 'problem', 'still', 'gave', 'set', '4', 'stars', 'prints', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'films', 'are', 'fun', 'are', 'definitely', 'worth', 'preserving', 'KINO', 'amazing', 'job', 'only', 'negative', 'comment', 'do', 'Stan', 'who', 'wanted', 'continue', 'performer', 'really', 'needed', 'Ollie', 'lot', 'more', ""'d"", 'realized', 'Ollie', 'well', 'more', 'likely', 'would', 'have', 'continued', 'wonderful', 'comic', 'supporting', 'character', 'actor', 'just', 'Eugene', 'Pallete', 'did', 'Roach', 'veteran']",N/A

Still, there just feels like something missing without his partner.  There are quite a number of funny moments, but overall they're just not as laughter-inducing as when he and Ollie were together.  I agree that part of the reason is because, while brilliantly-written and acted, Stan just hadn't developed into the character he later became.  In most of these shorts he plays the well-meaning kind-hearted simpleton we know and love, but that character isn't as developed or concrete as it is in the Laurel and Hardy shorts.  I like him because the character he played onscreen is so easy to relate to and like, but that persona just isn't there to relate to in some of the shorts, however well-crafted, and when it is there, it just isn't as constant, well-honed, and perfected as it was later to become.

830214,A3QIW6ULPIPM2V,B0002CHIDS,Chip Kaufmann,"[11, 12]","This new 2 DVD set from Kino from their SLAPSTICK SYMPOSIUM series showcases the talents of a pre-Oliver Hardy Stan Laurel and it's definitely a mixed bag. Laurel (born Arthur Stanley Jefferson) began as an English Music Hall comedian who was Chaplin's understudy when they came to America. While Chaplin quickly went on to fame and fortune, Stan labored for a number of outfits as a gag writer, director and performer. This collection features his work for Hal Roach in the early 20's and his own series of Stan Laurel comedies from the mid 20's.The biggest problem with many of these shorts especially the later ones is that Stan had yet to find a character that worked for him and he had yet to develop his comic timing. Since we don't identify with his character, he wears out his welcome way too soon. Many of the gags are brilliant and the situations quite funny but they go on far too long. The best shorts are the parodies such as THE SOILERS, ROUGHEST AFRICA, and especially DR PYCKLE AND MR PRYDE which is a truly hilarious send-up of the 1920 John Barrymore film. Others indulge in ethnic humor (SHORT KILTS, NEAR DUBLIN) and a few are downright bizarre and very hard to follow (HALF A MAN, THE SLEUTH).As good as he was, Stan needed someone to play off of and his teaming with Oliver Hardy allowed his comic genius to reach its full potential. A lot of the material on display here and many of Stan's mannerisms would be put to much better use in the L&H; comedies. And so despite the 3 star rating I recommend this set for the Hal Roach shorts and for the opportunity of watching Stan honing his craft. Most of the shorts are in good condition considering how rare they are and the piano accompaniment by Neil Brand is a perfect fit. By the way you can catch Ollie (billed as ""Babe"" sans mustache) in the last short YES YES NANETTE where he's directed by Stan.",3,Definitely A Mixed Bag.,1092960000,"08 20, 2004",2004,1873,"['new', '2', 'DVD', 'set', 'Kino', 'SLAPSTICK', 'SYMPOSIUM', 'series', 'talents', 'pre-Oliver', 'Hardy', 'Stan', 'Laurel', 'definitely', 'mixed', 'bag', 'Laurel', 'born', 'Arthur', 'Stanley', 'Jefferson', 'began', 'English', 'Music', 'Hall', 'comedian', 'who', 'was', 'Chaplin', 'understudy', 'when', 'came', 'America', 'Chaplin', 'quickly', 'went', 'fame', 'fortune', 'Stan', 'labored', 'number', 'outfits', 'gag', 'writer', 'director', 'performer', 'collection', 'work', 'Hal', 'Roach', 'early', '20', 'own', 'series', 'Stan', 'Laurel', 'comedies', 'mid', ""20's.The"", 'biggest', 'problem', 'many', 'shorts', 'especially', 'later', 'ones', 'Stan', 'had', 'yet', 'find', 'character', 'worked', 'had', 'yet', 'develop', 'comic', 'timing', 'do', ""n't"", 'identify', 'character', 'out', 'welcome', 'way', 'too', 'soon', 'Many', 'gags', 'are', 'brilliant', 'situations', 'quite', 'funny', 'go', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'best', 'shorts', 'are', 'parodies', 'such', 'THE', 'SOILERS', 'ROUGHEST', 'AFRICA', 'especially', 'DR', 'PYCKLE', 'AND', 'MR', 'PRYDE', 'truly', 'hilarious', 'send-up', '1920', 'John', 'Barrymore', 'film', 'Others', 'indulge', 'ethnic', 'humor', 'SHORT', 'KILTS', 'NEAR', 'DUBLIN', 'few', 'are', 'downright', 'bizarre', 'very', 'hard', 'follow', 'HALF', 'A', 'MAN', 'THE', 'SLEUTH', '.As', 'good', 'was', 'Stan', 'needed', 'someone', 'play', 'teaming', 'Oliver', 'Hardy', 'allowed', 'comic', 'genius', 'reach', 'full', 'potential', 'lot', 'material', 'display', 'here', 'many', 'Stan', 'mannerisms', 'would', 'be', 'put', 'much', 'better', 'use', 'L', 'H', 'comedies', 'so', '3', 'star', 'rating', 'recommend', 'set', 'Hal', 'Roach', 'shorts', 'opportunity', 'watching', 'Stan', 'honing', 'craft', 'Most', 'shorts', 'are', 'good', 'condition', 'considering', 'how', 'rare', 'are', 'piano', 'accompaniment', 'Neil', 'Brand', 'perfect', 'fit', 'way', 'can', 'catch', 'Ollie', 'billed', 'Babe', 'mustache', 'last', 'short', 'YES', 'YES', 'NANETTE', 'where', 'directed', 'Stan']",N/A

Postage Due, in which Stan causes mayhem by just mailing a letter. Roughest Africa, where Laurel is a professor on an African Safari, and manages to anger some wildlife. Several of the films feature James Finlayson as a nemeis to Stan. Fin would play similar roles in several Laurel and Hardy films.
