Lewis experts, many of whom are from Wheaton College, discuss Lewis' relationship with Mrs. Moore, the influence of his colleagues like Tolkien, and Lewis' profound effect and affect on Christian thought through his writings and lectures.Some of the dialogue is really of little use like speculating about his relationship with Mrs. Moore, for the relationship is a pre-occupation with sensationalism more than rigorous thought; however, many of the discussions do provide a nice framework for understanding Lewis's writings and life.  I think it is interesting to see Debra Winger interviewed since she is not a Christian.  In this case, it adds to the discussion since she brings a positive perspective about Lewis' approach.It was nice to see Lewis' stepson, Douglas Gresham, who brings an eye-witness account to the discussion as well as Walter Hooper.  Overall, this is a nice production and interesting hour spent discussing C.S. Lewis and his profound influence on Christian culture.The narration by Sir Ben Kingsley properly fits this DVD.",4,A Nice Overview of C.S.

Not only do you get to see where Lewis lived, played, wrote and worked, but you get a real sense of the mood of the era. Coupled with very professional production, there are great interviews of folks who studied with Lewis, knew him from other venues or were otherwise profoundly shaped by his works. Each interview sheds light on the value of Lewis for both his own age and ours, and why he gains more respect and readers each year.Also, if you like the dvd, get the book by the same title.

757389,A13FFOP88CJ4JC,B00009RGBN,Name Here,"[33, 33]","I saw this last night on PBS and was very pleased with the presentation.  I was almost afraid to watch as I am used to seeing the courage and faith and humanity of well known people debunked (probably in an effort to make the documentary more interesting) but it didn't happen here.  Even the wild speculation about a possible intimate relationship between Lewis and Mrs. Moor was handled as it probably is (the usual spontaneous curiousity that springs into the mind when unmarried and unrelated individuals of the opposite sex live under one roof...gosh, aren't we liberated though).I think that the factual material about Lewis's theology and conversion and faith, and his relationship with his wife Joy waswas treated in a most believable (read: true) way.  It was surprising that, as used to sensationalist reporting as I am,  the presentation did not come off boring.  Maybe I'm weird, but the documentary kept me hanging on every word.",5,One of the best!,1134086400,"12 9, 2005",2005,942,"['saw', 'last', 'night', 'PBS', 'was', 'very', 'pleased', 'presentation', 'was', 'almost', 'afraid', 'watch', 'am', 'used', 'seeing', 'courage', 'faith', 'humanity', 'well', 'known', 'people', 'debunked', 'probably', 'effort', 'make', 'documentary', 'more', 'interesting', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'here', 'Even', 'wild', 'speculation', 'possible', 'intimate', 'relationship', 'Lewis', 'Mrs.', 'Moor', 'was', 'handled', 'probably', 'usual', 'spontaneous', 'curiousity', 'mind', 'when', 'unmarried', 'unrelated', 'individuals', 'opposite', 'sex', 'live', 'one', 'roof', 'gosh', 'are', ""n't"", 'liberated', '.I', 'think', 'factual', 'material', 'Lewis', 'theology', 'conversion', 'faith', 'relationship', 'wife', 'Joy', 'waswas', 'treated', 'most', 'believable', 'read', 'true', 'way', 'was', 'surprising', 'that', 'used', 'sensationalist', 'reporting', 'am', 'presentation', 'did', 'not', 'come', 'off', 'boring', 'Maybe', ""'m"", 'weird', 'documentary', 'kept', 'hanging', 'word']",The Magic Never Ends - The Life and Work of C.S.

This documentary goes into more details and shows C.S. Lewis' home on a sunny day with a garden in full bloom. The camera sweeps across Oxford, showing statues, focusing in on the detailing on iron gates and shows people wandering about on Addison's walk.Within the story of his life, Lewis Scholars present their ideas about his life and give glowing testimonials of his work. They explain how the unifying elements in his writing gives them appeal to all denominations and comment on how he would have reacted to his work being adapted for film.It is fun to learn about how he loved to read Medieval romances and that he responded to all his letters while he continued to teach and publish even more books. His friendship with Tolkien is briefly discussed and they mention how Tolkien disliked the mixing of mythologies. They also show original drawings and pictures from the The Chronicles of Narnia.In the past few years I've been researching more of the life of C.S. Lewis and have begun to read more of his work. ""The Magic Never Ends"" is perhaps the perfect C.S. Lewis Biography for those interested in his scholarly pursuits. There are also quite a few extras to enjoy:Introduction to C.S. LewisTour of The KilnsTour of the Cotswolds and Oxford UniversityInterview with the Writer/DirectorBibliography - A section that includes a listing of 38 books written by C.S.
