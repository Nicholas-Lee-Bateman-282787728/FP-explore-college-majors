Benz ""CJB""","[2, 2]","One of the big surprises for me in watching ""Sell Out"" was that the album tracks can be fairly faithfully recreated on stage with a simple 4 piece band. They sound so busy on their recordings - and Joey Santiago plays live his catalogue of punk infused, spaced out guitar licks which I could've sworn on record were the result of numerous overdubs.This is a scaled down tour by DVD standards. It's really 4 bandmembers cranking it out, night after night, around the world - a no frills affair. But I can't imagine how it could've been better.They're not the sort of band who establish raport with the audience through sets, costumes, lighting or even consumate musicianship. It's about raw feeling, and this is here, almost surprisingly in abundance.You get 28 songs from a concert in Belfort, France, plus another 14 songs from various gigs all over the world (8 of the 14 tracks are not songs from the original 28). As you would expect, some songs are on the money, others are not. Although, I'd say more than half are spectacular renditions ""Ed is Dead"" is better than the original and I love the UK Surf version of ""Wave of Mutilation"". Kim Deal is fantastic on ""In Heaven"".There are a number of interviews in the bonus track section but not with the band, only tour mangagers etc, but worth watching at least once, and you have the option of watching the bonus tracks without them if you wish.There's also a terrific version of Monkey Gone to Heaven in which you can select which of 6 cameras you want to watch and can change during the song. It's quite fun, like directing your own clip.The best news is that all  of the bands chops are still intact. Deal, Lovering and Santiago all sound terrific and Frank Black can still scream with the best in the business.Reunion tours aren't often as spirited as this one.

931228,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B000AQKUF4,Cubist,"[14, 15]","It was the tour that no one thought would ever happen. In 1992, the Pixies were on top of the world. While they hadn't quite broken through into the mainstream in the United States, they were a huge hit in England, almost reaching stadium status. They played some of the largest European rock `n' roll festivals and even opened for U2. And then their lead singer Black Francis announced that the band had broken up.Black Francis and Kim Deal seemed as if they would never bury the hatchet and fans would never see their beloved band together again. And then it was announced last year that the Pixies were indeed going to be re-forming for a tour in select cities in Europe and the U.S. Anticipation was high and, if you were lucky enough to see them live, reportedly they did not disappoint. Now, you can get an idea of what it was like with this new DVD that gives you a sample of the band live in concert.Black Francis' voice sounds as ferocious as it ever did. He gives it a good workout on ""Something Against You"" and ""U-Mass,"" the latter a giddy, psychotic ode to the University of Massachusetts. Later on, he tears it up on ""Tame,"" alternating between almost-whispered verses and deranged howling choruses. Joey is still the unsung, low-key guitar god he always was, delivering the insanely catchy riffs that the Pixies were revered for.They pull out such memorable hits like ""Monkey Gone to Heaven"" and ""Here Comes Your Man"" along with underrated gems like the surreal ""Subbacultcha."" The only minor, personal caveat I have with the DVD is the short shrift given to the criminally underrated and much maligned Bossanova album. Only a dreamy, surf-soaked rendition of ""Velouria"" is played in their set. Also, their misunderstood swan song, Trompe Le Monde is also largely ignored in favour of older material.There is a selection of 14 songs performed on the 2004 tour all over the world with optional interview segments from two of their long-time tour crew members. One of my personal favourites, ""Planet of Sound"" gets a fine workout in New Orleans while the Bossanova album is shown more love with a nice rendition of ""Is She Weird"" in Lowell, MA.Finally, there is ""MX Monkey's Choice"" which allows you to switch from six different angles with your DVD remote while watching a live version of ""Monkey Gone to Heaven.""",4,Good if you missed them on this last tour...,1130976000,"11 3, 2005",2005,2327,"['was', 'tour', 'one', 'thought', 'would', 'ever', 'happen', '1992', 'Pixies', 'were', 'top', 'world', 'had', ""n't"", 'quite', 'broken', 'mainstream', 'United', 'States', 'were', 'huge', 'hit', 'England', 'almost', 'reaching', 'stadium', 'status', 'played', 'largest', 'European', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'festivals', 'even', 'opened', 'U2', 'then', 'lead', 'singer', 'Black', 'Francis', 'announced', 'band', 'had', 'broken', 'up.Black', 'Francis', 'Kim', 'Deal', 'seemed', 'would', 'never', 'bury', 'hatchet', 'fans', 'would', 'never', 'see', 'beloved', 'band', 'together', 'again', 'then', 'was', 'announced', 'last', 'year', 'Pixies', 'were', 'indeed', 'going', 'be', 're-forming', 'tour', 'select', 'cities', 'Europe', 'U.S', 'Anticipation', 'was', 'high', 'were', 'lucky', 'enough', 'see', 'live', 'reportedly', 'did', 'not', 'disappoint', 'Now', 'can', 'get', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'new', 'DVD', 'sample', 'band', 'live', 'concert.Black', 'Francis', 'voice', 'sounds', 'as', 'ferocious', 'ever', 'did', 'good', 'workout', 'Something', 'Against', 'U-Mass', 'latter', 'giddy', 'psychotic', 'ode', 'University', 'Massachusetts', 'Later', 'up', 'Tame', 'alternating', 'almost-whispered', 'verses', 'deranged', 'howling', 'choruses', 'Joey', 'still', 'unsung', 'low-key', 'guitar', 'god', 'always', 'was', 'delivering', 'insanely', 'catchy', 'riffs', 'Pixies', 'were', 'revered', 'for.They', 'pull', 'out', 'such', 'memorable', 'hits', 'Monkey', 'Gone', 'Heaven', 'Here', 'Man', 'underrated', 'gems', 'surreal', 'Subbacultcha', 'only', 'minor', 'personal', 'caveat', 'have', 'DVD', 'short', 'shrift', 'given', 'criminally', 'underrated', 'much', 'maligned', 'Bossanova', 'album', 'Only', 'dreamy', 'surf-soaked', 'rendition', 'Velouria', 'played', 'set', 'Also', 'misunderstood', 'swan', 'song', 'Trompe', 'Le', 'Monde', 'also', 'largely', 'ignored', 'favour', 'older', 'material.There', 'selection', '14', 'songs', 'performed', '2004', 'tour', 'world', 'optional', 'interview', 'segments', 'two', 'long-time', 'tour', 'crew', 'members', 'One', 'personal', 'favourites', 'Planet', 'Sound', 'fine', 'workout', 'New', 'Orleans', 'Bossanova', 'album', 'shown', 'more', 'love', 'nice', 'rendition', 'Is', 'Weird', 'Lowell', 'MA.Finally', 'MX', 'Monkey', 'Choice', 'switch', 'six', 'different', 'angles', 'DVD', 'remote', 'watching', 'live', 'version', 'Monkey', 'Gone', 'Heaven']",N/A

Their set is packed with 28 Pixies favorites. It may seem like a lot, but after watching, you realize they're short songs. The band sounds great, especially in 5.1 sound. Included as bonus material are 15 more live performances from various stops along their reunion tour route. Fortunately, most of them are selections that were not included in the main show. You have the option of watching the bonus performances intertwined with interviews from various members of the group. Another interesting feature (mostly for video nuts) is the ability to change your view through six different cameras.The BadThis is my first introduction to the Pixies, and I must say I was not that impressed with their music. It just seemed a little to artsy and bland for me. Some of the up-tempo tracks were cool, but for the most part I found myself advancing to the next. The performance itself wasn't very exciting.

Of course they knew that they had continued to be revered as one of the great bands of the past twenty years.  Moreover, with time their stature had only grown, so that they were bigger in 2004 than they were in 1994.  Their return found them headlining festivals, playing arenas and even athletic fields.As this DVD shows, they did not return as mere relics.  All of them were still completely on top of their game musically, on top of all of their chops, and in great voice.  Charles Thompson aka Black Francis still is one of the great screamers in the history of rock, which is a miracle in and of itself (why hasn't he had 3 or 4 throat operations?).  They may not have aged especially gracefully--Kim Deal's weight gain would be alarming except that Charles Thompson may have become the most overweight performer in the history of indie rock, rivaled only by past non-indie rockers Leslie West, Lowell George, and Meatloaf, and all three of the guys shave their heads to disguise receding hairlines--but they still play as well as ever.I didn't search hard for any omissions, but I think every Pixies song that one would like to hear appears either on the concert that is at the heart of the disc or in the generous group of extra performances included as Special Features.  Being live footage, the sound isn't as crisp as the studio albums, but otherwise the DVD could serve as an excellent compilation disc for the uninitiated.  For live performances, the sound is quite good and the disc sounded great on 5.1 surround sound.  I was less happy with the film footage.  It was crisp and sharp with many interesting shots, but the best concert film footage always contains as few cuts as possible.  The editor should allow the camera to linger over an instrument, focus on hands on the neck of a guitar or bass, or spend extra time with a vocalist.  Here the cutting was nervous and somewhat frenetic, moving from one performer to another, shifting to the crowd, or rapidly shifting from one to another.  I find this not only not especially interesting but a tad stressful.  I have always thought that would-be or actual directors of concert film should study Jonathan Demme's film of the Talking Heads STOP MAKING SENSE ad nausea and emulate it as closely as possible, with side trips to Martin Scorcese's THE LAST WALTZ of the Band.  These are two major directors and yet their films are refreshingly devoid of rapid cutting.  Their cutting is languid and leisurely, giving the viewer time to take in what they are seeing.  These lessons were not learned by the makers of this DVD.Nonetheless, this is a thoroughly satisfying concert DVD and demonstrates just why the Pixies one of the most influential bands of recent decades.",4,Fine film footage of one of the most important bands of the past two decades,1146441600,"05 1, 2006",2006,2822,"['How', 'satisfying', 'must', 'Pixies', '2004', 'world', 'have', 'been', 'members', 'band', 'course', 'knew', 'had', 'continued', 'be', 'revered', 'one', 'great', 'bands', 'past', 'twenty', 'years', 'Moreover', 'time', 'stature', 'had', 'only', 'grown', 'were', 'bigger', '2004', 'were', '1994', 'return', 'found', 'headlining', 'festivals', 'playing', 'arenas', 'even', 'athletic', 'fields.As', 'DVD', 'shows', 'did', 'not', 'return', 'mere', 'relics', 'were', 'still', 'completely', 'top', 'game', 'musically', 'top', 'chops', 'great', 'voice', 'Charles', 'Thompson', 'Black', 'Francis', 'still', 'one', 'great', 'screamers', 'history', 'rock', 'miracle', 'why', ""n't"", 'had', '3', '4', 'throat', 'operations', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'aged', 'especially', 'gracefully', 'Kim', 'Deal', 'weight', 'gain', 'would', 'be', 'alarming', 'Charles', 'Thompson', 'may', 'have', 'become', 'most', 'overweight', 'performer', 'history', 'indie', 'rock', 'rivaled', 'only', 'past', 'non-indie', 'rockers', 'Leslie', 'West', 'Lowell', 'George', 'Meatloaf', 'three', 'guys', 'shave', 'heads', 'disguise', 'receding', 'hairlines', 'still', 'play', 'as', 'well', 'ever.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'search', 'hard', 'omissions', 'think', 'Pixies', 'song', 'one', 'would', 'like', 'hear', 'concert', 'heart', 'disc', 'generous', 'group', 'extra', 'performances', 'included', 'Special', 'Features', 'Being', 'live', 'footage', 'sound', ""n't"", 'as', 'crisp', 'studio', 'albums', 'otherwise', 'DVD', 'could', 'serve', 'excellent', 'compilation', 'disc', 'uninitiated', 'live', 'performances', 'sound', 'quite', 'good', 'disc', 'sounded', 'great', '5.1', 'surround', 'sound', 'was', 'less', 'happy', 'film', 'footage', 'was', 'crisp', 'sharp', 'many', 'interesting', 'shots', 'best', 'concert', 'film', 'footage', 'always', 'few', 'cuts', 'possible', 'editor', 'should', 'allow', 'camera', 'linger', 'instrument', 'focus', 'hands', 'neck', 'guitar', 'bass', 'spend', 'extra', 'time', 'vocalist', 'Here', 'cutting', 'was', 'nervous', 'somewhat', 'frenetic', 'moving', 'one', 'performer', 'shifting', 'crowd', 'rapidly', 'shifting', 'one', 'find', 'not', 'only', 'not', 'especially', 'interesting', 'tad', 'stressful', 'have', 'always', 'thought', 'would-be', 'actual', 'directors', 'concert', 'film', 'should', 'study', 'Jonathan', 'Demme', 'film', 'Talking', 'Heads', 'STOP', 'MAKING', 'SENSE', 'ad', 'nausea', 'emulate', 'as', 'closely', 'possible', 'side', 'trips', 'Martin', 'Scorcese', 'THE', 'LAST', 'WALTZ', 'Band', 'are', 'two', 'major', 'directors', 'yet', 'films', 'are', 'refreshingly', 'devoid', 'rapid', 'cutting', 'cutting', 'languid', 'leisurely', 'giving', 'viewer', 'time', 'take', 'what', 'are', 'seeing', 'lessons', 'were', 'not', 'learned', 'makers', 'DVD.Nonetheless', 'thoroughly', 'satisfying', 'concert', 'DVD', 'just', 'why', 'Pixies', 'one', 'most', 'influential', 'bands', 'recent', 'decades']",N/A

931235,A25JHXYK10F0A6,B000AQKUF4,"Thomas D. Ryan ""American Hit Network""","[7, 8]","Watching this video sort of makes me feel like Rip Van Winkle. The band was at its (original) peak of fame while I was busy doing research for my first book on pop music history, so when the Pixies became the darlings of indie-rock, I was immersed in the Dixie Cups, the Corsairs, Eddie Cochran and God only knows what else. For a few years, I was decidedly out of touch with contemporary culture, and this video pretty much proves that it was my loss. I have been playing catch-up ever since, so in a sense, the reunion tour (and this corresponding video product) makes me feel as though the band did it specifically for my own sake. Thanks, guys.In a sense, this is truer than it sounds. When the Pixies were together and releasing new albums on a fairly regular basis, the size of their audience was respectable, but not particularly huge. For reasons that may have surprised the band as well as everyone else, the `sell-out' reunion tour provided the band with an audience that seems to have increased tenfold in their absence. This DVD helps to explain how and why this happened.If you liked the Pixies then, then you are fairly certain to be happy about the ""Sellout 2004 Reunion Tour"" DVD. It features rock solid performances with an impressive degree of continuity, and most importantly, it never lapses into nostalgia or self-congratulatory reminiscing. The main part of the disk is dedicated to a single performance filmed in Belfort, France. The band rolls through twenty-eight tracks, and it would be difficult to not be impressed by the overall body of work that is presented here, especially the songwriting. I admit that I didn't find their performance style particularly compelling, and the musicianship and vocals aren't stellar, either. There's more here than meets the eye, though, and the sum is apparently greater than the individual parts, especially if I am to judge from the audience enthusiasm that accompanies the entire performance.For me, the 'bonus' bits are more interesting than the complete show, because they are more varied (Different venues! Different cities!), and more informative (Interviews with band staff), with lots of cool, relevant historical information about the band. Even better, it fills in some of the key `missing' tracks from the Belfort show. I didn't know very much by this band, but ""Debaser"" is immediately recognizable to me. For whatever reason, it was not included in the Belfort set list, so it's great to see the band perform a great version of the song from a show Scotland. ""Caribou"", taken from their Coachella performance, is fabulous, and the version of ""Here Comes Your Man"", taken from a performance at the More Festival in England, is superior to the French version. The excerpts from their Japanese performances are totally great, too (and the Japanese music fans are incredibly enthusiastic). The bonus disk works so well because it does the best job of conveying the triumphal nature of this reunion tour, while providing context that helps me to better understand a band that I previously knew very little of. I'm a decade late and a few bucks short, but it's cool to get this chance to redeem myself.
