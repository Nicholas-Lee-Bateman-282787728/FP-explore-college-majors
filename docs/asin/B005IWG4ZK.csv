In a practical sense, it was painful to watch.  There were too many artistic transitions from scene to scene (i.e. landscape shots with thematic music).  The dialogue was hard to follow; often the actors were talking with food in their mouths.  To me this movie is a dramatic documentary without a narrator.  It's a very very slow-burn without a boom at the end.  Instead you'll get a quick summary of the resolution of the investigation into the murders.",1,Too slow to be entertaining,1334361600,"04 14, 2012",2012,558,"['love', 'watching', 'non-traditional', 'films', 'imports', 'technical', 'sense', 'was', 'excellent', 'movie', 'practical', 'sense', 'was', 'painful', 'watch', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'artistic', 'transitions', 'scene', 'scene', 'i.e', 'landscape', 'shots', 'thematic', 'music', 'dialogue', 'was', 'hard', 'follow', 'often', 'actors', 'were', 'talking', 'food', 'mouths', 'movie', 'dramatic', 'documentary', 'narrator', 'very', 'very', 'slow-burn', 'boom', 'end', 'Instead', ""'ll"", 'get', 'quick', 'summary', 'resolution', 'investigation', 'murders']",Snowtown

After about 30 minutes I realized I'd been suckered in by a shill.The sound quality is so poor, you'll find yourself desperately trying to find the right audio, trying to actually hear what the actors are saying so you turn the volume up, only to have the scene switch quickly and have loud music BLASTED in your ears.  I would normally suggest you watch such films with CC, however, predictably, nobody has taken the time to do the CC, probably because they couldn't suffer through the entire film.I can't say anything about the acting, either way, as the script was so poor, and the lines mumbled so badly (note: this is a reflection upon both the director and producer of the film, as when we see a professionally produced film, if the actor DID mumble a line badly, they will have to read the line again directly into the microphone so it can be edited in) I can't tell if I should blame the acting because the production value is so low, or tell if the actors did a great job at portraying vapid, vaguely creepy characters (though by the end of the film, it's clear EVERY character in it comes off as creepy).  Note, I'm not saying anything about the story, because frankly, without being able to hear the characters talk no matter HOW many times I adjusted the volume or tried to adjust for better mid range, etc.., I never really figured out what the story was supposed to be.  Some kid was sadly molested by a neighbor, then by his brother, and eventually people die. That's about all I can tell you for certain.This is an utterly disturbing movie, though I can't tell if I found it so because I found the entire film disturbing, or if it was the director's obvious desire to shock you (it did accomplish this.  I'm shocked I'm even taking the time to write this) I found disturbing, or maybe it was just the fact this film somehow managed to get onto Amazon.  Whatever the reason, I've wasted almost 2 hours of my life on this, and it's the last 2 hours I will ever spend worrying about it.Just know, before you watch this, you were warned you would LEGITIMATELY wish you could get those 2 hours back afterwards.

The story is essentially about how sociopaths can influence others to become sociopaths at some level.  It may even influence reviewers such as the earlier review where the he states that he enjoys this type of film.  That mankind can attain such sickness as to perform acts of extreme cruelty to others is nothing new to the film industry and I viewed the film expecting some degree of unpleasantness.  My overall emotion was one of pity for most of the characters because of their lack of intelligence that left them unexpecting of their demise or unknowing of the happiness to which a better life might lead.  But I was also expecting something new or different in the presentation of the subjects.  Given the favorable reviews the film received, I was disappointed.Furthermore, I do not need to be told by other reviewers what types of films I should watch just because I did not like a particular film.

It was frustrating. And having just watched it  I wish I knew what happened in the details  and did I guess right. Loss of nuance by loss of dialogue really annoying.However credit goes to holding my attention despite. It is a gripping realistic enaction of mental abuse and how it turns the abused into the abuser.Abuse normalises and increasingly normalises what we would otherwise run screaming from straight to the police. It is called mental darkness because parameters are gradually eroded . Bunting erodes and moulds Jamie. The film is primarily about this process between the two. I never lost empathy for Jamie as the film is clear how its happening against his will. He becomes so traumatised he can't think in a straight line and walk right out that door and keep on walking away with his mother ( in denial but she's lost too).It was chilling how more and more of Bunting's character unravelled from cheery cajoler to eyes as dead as a sharks.Yet then show him as someone capable of paternal feelings and fellowy comradeship although did he or did he not bump off one of his most loyal mates?The film does a good job of showing how normal and human the victims could be. I mean the little nerd kid didn't deserve to die man! ! Likewise Jamie's friend. Another poignant scene when Jamie was looking over the porch at a beautiful calm and sunny day......out of reach because he was being called in to finish watching Bunting torture someone in the bathroom. The film does not show the actual torture scenes. If it did it would de-sensitise and sensationalise.Menace is real enough throughout the film so it didn't need to. Plus what I'd imagine took place is worse than anything they'd show ( tailor-made)Well just goes to show- I thought Jamie WAS Bunting as a youngster for most of the film and Bunting was just an abusive ""uncle"" of his mother's.Power Full Film.

I was pretty disgusted by it and would expect that most normal people would be.  Yet as the movie wound on I couldn't help but admire the ""acting"" that felt so seamlessly real.  It's one of the reasons the film gets under your skin so much - the people and locations come off so realistically.  Which of course makes everything else that happens all the more horrific.  I didn't even realize it was based on a true story until the end which again only increased my appreciation for the elements that made this picture so believable.Bunting, in the tradition of Manson and Hitler, was the kind of psychopath that got others to help him.  The violence in the movie is not so much bloody as psychological - yes there is certainly blood (physical violence), and male rape scenes. Bunting himself starts off with a seemingly reasonable distaste for child molesters. Part of the disturbing nature of the film is that a part of you may not completely fault him his desiring of vigilante justice.  On the other hand, what starts as a certain amount of desire for revenge and distaste for criminals, turns simply to psycopathic blood lust and sadism.  It's interesting and harrowing to watch the shift from one to the other, and to watch the hapless victims in his life that willingly or unwillingly become a part of his madness.  One has to step away and realize that the work that went into this was the work of actors, screenwriters and a director - a depiction of what happened and not the actual events themselves - before one can realize what was accomplished here.

Based on a true story coming out of South Australia in the nineties, this film looks at the role played by a charismatic, self-serving vigilante named John Bunting who inserted himself into a family living in a low-end suburb of Adelaide and proceeded to enlist its members in an effort to `clean up' the neighbourhood of its degenerates: druggies, pimps, perverts, and drifters. What is really chilling about this dreary movie is that the filmmaker tends to focus a lot on how Bunting, the psychopathic ringleader, disposes of his victims with such calm and deliberate dispatch. The family whom he has befriended are so taken up with their own victimization(the sons have been molested by a neighbour)that it fails to see his true motives. He is a hardwired, sadistic killer hell-bent on taking the law into his own hands and making unwitting people do his evil bidding. His ability to make others do his dirty work with relative ease is the most visceral part of this film. In demagogic fashion, Bunting creates a familial co-dependency in the community where people actually start believing that he will make life better for them even if they already know what he is really up to behing the scenes. It will take incredible courage for someone to step up and break this terrible cycle of fear, violence and murder. The cast-setting in this production adequately represents the criminal element in society that loves to bully, torture, and manipulate weak-willed people into submission.",4,The Power to Coerce,1376092800,"08 10, 2013",2013,1640,"['Natural', 'Born', 'Killers', 'Australian', 'flick', 'many', 'different', 'psychological', 'facets', 'serial', 'killing', 'human', 'relationships', 'Based', 'true', 'story', 'coming', 'South', 'Australia', 'nineties', 'film', 'role', 'played', 'charismatic', 'self-serving', 'vigilante', 'named', 'John', 'Bunting', 'who', 'inserted', 'family', 'living', 'low-end', 'suburb', 'Adelaide', 'proceeded', 'enlist', 'members', 'effort', 'clean', 'up', 'neighbourhood', 'degenerates', 'druggies', 'pimps', 'perverts', 'drifters', 'What', 'really', 'chilling', 'dreary', 'movie', 'filmmaker', 'focus', 'lot', 'how', 'Bunting', 'psychopathic', 'ringleader', 'disposes', 'victims', 'such', 'calm', 'deliberate', 'dispatch', 'family', 'whom', 'befriended', 'are', 'so', 'taken', 'up', 'own', 'victimization', 'sons', 'have', 'been', 'molested', 'neighbour', 'see', 'true', 'motives', 'hardwired', 'sadistic', 'killer', 'hell-bent', 'taking', 'law', 'own', 'hands', 'making', 'unwitting', 'people', 'do', 'evil', 'bidding', 'ability', 'make', 'others', 'do', 'dirty', 'work', 'relative', 'ease', 'most', 'visceral', 'part', 'film', 'demagogic', 'fashion', 'Bunting', 'familial', 'co-dependency', 'community', 'where', 'people', 'actually', 'start', 'believing', 'will', 'make', 'life', 'better', 'even', 'already', 'know', 'what', 'really', 'up', 'behing', 'scenes', 'will', 'take', 'incredible', 'courage', 'someone', 'step', 'up', 'break', 'terrible', 'cycle', 'fear', 'violence', 'murder', 'cast-setting', 'production', 'adequately', 'criminal', 'element', 'society', 'bully', 'torture', 'manipulate', 'weak-willed', 'people', 'submission']",Snowtown
1462053,A1Y0HX12MCT6OR,B005IWG4ZK,I'm Right,"[1, 1]","Snowtown is based off of an actual serial killer in Australia (of which I know nothing about) where an abused family of boys go through a paternal figure transition, and the phrase ""out of the frying pan and into the fire"" applies here, but if you happen to not know anything about this story it's best I just leave it here.Not since Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer have I seen such an intimate and disturbing look into a murderer's psyche. But what I found most interesting about Snowtown was how one of the characters just switches from 'lovable family man' to 'sadistic psychopath"" as if he had a switch in his mind. Another thing that was interesting was the neighborhood having dinner together and getting into a really heated discussion of just how severe the punishment for pedophiles should be (a discussion I'm sure everyone's been in before), and you really start to see the warning signs of how far one of the characters takes the conversation to.Also another thing I liked about Snowtown was how claustrophobic the whole thing felt if you put yourself into the main character's shoes. Whenever I watch something like this I always think about what I would've done in that situation, but Snowtown just shows you how helpless some very unfortunate souls are, and it makes it all the more disturbing that the kid is basically forced to become a psychopath, nurture wins this one.Snowtown is a disturbing and ugly film, yet you can't deny it's very well done in every regard.

There are things that could have been done to make the movie better, but what we got is well worth your time as long as you can stomach some of the more brutal scenes (and even at its worst, Kurzel kept the bloodflow relatively light on this one; it is far more In Cold Blood than it is Wolf Creek).Plot: Jamie Vlassakis (Lucas Pittaway in his screen debut--as is everyone listed in the summary without a credit) is twelve years old as we open. He describes a recurring dream he has; this is not a mentally stable individual. His mother Elizabeth (Louise Harris)'s boyfriend, one night when babysitting, convinces the boys to undress and have pictures taken of them, which leaks out into the community. Elizabeth is angry and, desiring revenge, turns to local in-the-know guy Barry (The Last Confession of Alexander Pearce's Richard Green), who introduces her to virulent, angry, charismatic anti-pedophile John Bunting (Not Suitable for Children's Daniel Henshall). Bunting, with the help of his friend Robert (Aaron Viergever), Jamie, and a few others from the neighborhood, start a campaign aimed at driving the boyfriend out of the neighborhood. While this is occurring, Jamie starts bonding with John, who starts seeming like the father figure Jamie never had, and Robert. John hangs around, stirring up the natives, getting involved with Elizabeth, and further befriending Jamie. And when John's tactics turn more violent, up to and including murder, John offers Jamie the chance to finish off someone whose crimes hit very close to home indeed.In a reversal from my usual complaint about movies like this, it's the first half of the movie that worked for me--the slow part that shows how John Bunting not only ingratiated himself into a family, but into an entire neighborhood, many of whom were more than willing to condone his activities as time went on. Shaun Grant's examination of Bunting's infiltration of lower-class society, while less fact-based than the latter half of the film, is persuasive and thoughtful. Once the movie tries to get down to brass tacks, it seems almost as if Kurzel is trying to court broadcast television; I'm amazed the film was given an R when submitted for rating in America given how non-explicit it is, save a scene or two. This certainly doesn't make it not worth watching, but don't go into it expecting nastiness. ***",3,I can't sleep 'cause my bed's on fire...,1366070400,"04 16, 2013",2013,2890,"['Snowtown', 'Justin', 'Kurzel', '2012', 'Given', 'director', 'Justin', 'Kurzel', 'screenwriter', 'Shaun', 'Grant', 'were', 'making', 'feature-film', 'debuts', 'Snowtown', 'very', 'impressive', 'piece', 'work', 'biopic', 'line', 'exploitation', 'education', 'successfully', 'have', 'stuck', 'close', 'actual', 'story', 'based', 'what', ""'ve"", 'read', 'other', 'making', 'Jamie', 'Vlassakis', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'wrung', 'fine', 'performances', 'cast', 'have', 'been', 'aggressively', 'recruited', 'world', 'non-professional', 'actors', 'are', 'things', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'make', 'movie', 'better', 'what', 'got', 'well', 'time', 'as', 'long', 'can', 'stomach', 'more', 'brutal', 'scenes', 'even', 'worst', 'Kurzel', 'kept', 'bloodflow', 'relatively', 'light', 'one', 'far', 'more', 'Cold', 'Blood', 'Wolf', 'Creek', '.Plot', 'Jamie', 'Vlassakis', 'Lucas', 'Pittaway', 'screen', 'debut', 'everyone', 'listed', 'summary', 'credit', 'twelve', 'years', 'old', 'open', 'recurring', 'dream', 'not', 'mentally', 'stable', 'individual', 'mother', 'Elizabeth', 'Louise', 'Harris', 'boyfriend', 'one', 'night', 'when', 'babysitting', 'boys', 'undress', 'have', 'pictures', 'taken', 'out', 'community', 'Elizabeth', 'angry', 'desiring', 'revenge', 'local', 'in-the-know', 'guy', 'Barry', 'Last', 'Confession', 'Alexander', 'Pearce', 'Richard', 'Green', 'who', 'virulent', 'angry', 'charismatic', 'anti-pedophile', 'John', 'Bunting', 'Not', 'Suitable', 'Children', 'Daniel', 'Henshall', 'Bunting', 'help', 'friend', 'Robert', 'Aaron', 'Viergever', 'Jamie', 'few', 'others', 'neighborhood', 'start', 'campaign', 'aimed', 'driving', 'boyfriend', 'neighborhood', 'occurring', 'Jamie', 'bonding', 'John', 'who', 'seeming', 'father', 'figure', 'Jamie', 'never', 'had', 'Robert', 'John', 'around', 'stirring', 'up', 'natives', 'getting', 'involved', 'Elizabeth', 'further', 'befriending', 'Jamie', 'when', 'John', 'tactics', 'turn', 'more', 'violent', 'up', 'including', 'murder', 'John', 'Jamie', 'chance', 'finish', 'off', 'someone', 'crimes', 'hit', 'very', 'close', 'home', 'indeed.In', 'reversal', 'usual', 'complaint', 'movies', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'worked', 'slow', 'part', 'how', 'John', 'Bunting', 'not', 'only', 'ingratiated', 'family', 'entire', 'neighborhood', 'many', 'whom', 'were', 'more', 'willing', 'condone', 'activities', 'time', 'went', 'Shaun', 'Grant', 'examination', 'Bunting', 'infiltration', 'lower-class', 'society', 'less', 'fact-based', 'latter', 'half', 'film', 'persuasive', 'thoughtful', 'movie', 'get', 'down', 'brass', 'tacks', 'almost', 'Kurzel', 'trying', 'court', 'broadcast', 'television', ""'m"", 'amazed', 'film', 'was', 'given', 'R', 'when', 'submitted', 'rating', 'America', 'given', 'how', 'non-explicit', 'save', 'scene', 'two', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'make', 'not', 'worth', 'watching', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'expecting', 'nastiness', '***']",Snowtown
1462064,A1WFEHAV42HTM5,B005IWG4ZK,Scrimshaw,"[1, 4]","The Snowtown Murders is quite possibly one of the darkest, bleakest films I've ever seen, and I've seen alot of dark films. It is directed by Justin Kurzel and takes place in a low-income Adelaide Suburb called Salisbury North. It focuses on thoroughly cruel and unlikable characters interacting with and getting killed by even more cruel and unlikable characters, with a few exceptions. I understand this was a true story, but I don't understand why this film, and indeed films like it are made, which focus endlessly on the darker, more brutal side of humanity and leave little hope for light and comfort, and is a large part of the problem of much of modern western society. It had very strong language and one particularly brutal scene that I found hard to watch. This film is incredible bleak and almost nightmarish in it's quality. Many people claim that there needs to be more films like this that focus on ""reality"" but as Terry Gilliam once said, ""the world is a million possible things"". I think that there need to be less films like this and more that focus on the brighter, benevolent, side of humanity, and our full potential. Reality can indeed be very joyful and beautiful. The Snowtown Murders focus on two characters, teenage Jamie and adult John and how their relationship quickly takes a very dark turn when John and a friend of his begin murdering other people brutally. It was never particularly good to begin with, with John, who seems at first very amiable and charismatic, helps Jamie and his brothers to harass a pedophile neighbor who took indecent pictures of them. If the film has one strong point, it's that they only depicted the brutal murder of one of the victims, Jamie's half-brother.

1462069,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B005IWG4ZK,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[27, 34]","This is a film by director Justin Curzel who, with Warp Pictures, had to get reporting restrictions lifted on the real life case that this film depicts, in order to screen his work. It is about the `Bodies in Barrels' murders that took place in South Australia between 1992 and 1999. In the film we start with a low rent family in Adelaide's suburbs, a place that is beyond bleak, full of slots, smokes and squalor.  The mother (Elizabeth Harvey) has three sons and an elder one (half brother) who comes in later. They have a `special uncle' who lives across the road, and whilst he seems to be interested in Elisabeth, he is actually abusing the young boys. She finds out and goes `ape' to coin an oft used vernacular.Enter new guy John Bunting (Daniel Henshall) he appears as a knight in rusting armour and sets about ousting the paedophile. Now ensconced as a vigilante hero, he takes on the mantle of local moral guardian and enlists the help of others in his `work'. Jamie (Lucas Pittaway) is sixteen and has more troubles than most of that age, John decides he needs to `grow a pair' and thus he gets sucked into a world of violence, torture and murder.This is a beautifully shot film and has been accused of being too arty, lingering shots, periods of no dialogue etc. However the seeming ordinariness of those moments is the perfect juxtaposition for the brutal things that are happening on screen. All of the actors are totally convincing, even the world ropiest transvestite and the guy with learning difficulties. The music is minimal but potent and we have a full grotesquery of supporting characters, plus scenes of kangaroo butchery which is pretty disturbing.I was so gripped by this that I felt I had only been watching for about an hour when it had finished, when this is a two hour film. I then checked out the real case and it is actually worse than what the film depicts, which is probably a good thing. The film leaves it up to the viewer to judge the people and whilst you are clear who the guilty parties are, as things progress the clear lines of guilt and innocence get blurred to beyond recognition.Once again Screen Australia has brought us an excellent film that whilst many will find disturbing still  makes a powerful statement and an engrossing film into the bargain. I can only recommend with the caveat that the violence is disturbing, but despite that is far from gratuitous, this is not `torture porn'.

I can only agree to several points which have been raised before, chiefly among them the at times incomprehensible accents, and the publisher of this BR deemed wise not to include subtitles. Bravo.Other than that, this attempt at gritty and crude reality has been seen time and time again before, with usually better results. The thing drags and drags on and on, with interminable scenes including a bunch of people who are never introduced in the first place (who'll only vanish later, without further explanations) bantering and chit chatting back and forth for what seems forever.From time to time, though, the perpetrator of this celluloid waste does try to wake the spectator with some violent scenes, the most gruesome of which involving (real) animal cruelty. Excuse me? Dude (yes I'm talking to you, beginner Kurzel), the happy days of Cannibal Holocaust and all are over, hello? To have real animal cruelty in a movie today is totally inexcusable. If the producers of this crap didn't have the doughs necessary to plod forward with special effects, they should have abstained. Period. Notwithstanding the cynics, you don't take lives for the sake of entertainment. And this thing is not even entertaining.Lastly, if you want to understand ANY of this mess, you'd better have a solid grasp on the John Bunting events before you watch this.
