415534,A1LBF5XZNYD6QR,6304341202,Brett Johnson,"[19, 40]","I think ""Foxfire"" is trying to make a positive stand about young women defending their rights.  The problem is...it goes about it all wrong.The fresh, young cast is wonderful.  Yes, Angelina Jolie shows what kind of talent she has.  Jolie plays a character nicknamed Legs.  Legs literally shows up out of nowhere and struts into a high school biology class.  She pulls the pins out of a live (!!) frog that is about to be dissected and tosses the frog out a window to freedom.  She then climbs out the window herself.  Legs has this odd habit of showing up at the school even though she apparently has no connection to it.Anyway, she befriends four girls at the school.  She soon finds out that the scummy biology teacher has been sexually harassing and fondling some of his female students.  They decide to get a bit of revenge and end up beating him up.  The girls are then suspended for a few weeks.  They find an abandoned home in pretty good shape and they decide to make it their hangout.Some female bonding and hijinks take place.  They give each other tattoos.  They break into the school and carelessly start a fire.  Implausibly, one of the girls is almost abducted by a bunch of guys from the school.  Luckily, a couple of her friends had been hiding behind some bushes or something and one of them pulls a knife on the guys.  Then they steal the main abductor's vehicle.  They end up being arrested and charged with several serious felonies.  Extremely weak plotting if you ask me.Ultimately, the film tailspins out of control.  As the movie progresses, the viewer loses more and more sympathy for the girls.  It should be the other way around.  You should care more about characters once you get to know them.  These girls make such awful and selfish decisions that you end up feeling that they deserve whatever comes to them.

The plot moves so fast and the characters become so close so quickly, I didn't know how and why they got from point A to point B.  To answer my questions I went straight to the source and read the book, then I re-viewed the movie.  It was then that I fell in love.  The adaption was brilliant, the story was slightly different but the movie kept the book's important elements, the most important being the characters.  The producers of this film couldn't have picked anyone better than Angelina Jolie, who displays many of the same qualities of her character, Legs. Angelina Jolie's portrayal is so real, yet she is so dreamlike, etherial, and addictive.  These people put together as one is a lethal combination for both the audience and the other characters within the story.

Jolie becomes a mother figure  for the girls, however, has to leave them when their adventures extend too  far.  Jolie's performance is a bit, shall we say, nonexistant.  I've never  seen a performance from her so cold, and airy.  It's just.....well.....not  good.  However she came back and proved herself with &quot;Girl,  Interrupted&quot;, and carried home an Oscar for it.  Actress Jenny Lewis  gives a good performance as the goody goody redhead.

I'm probably having a very nostalgic reaction as I haven't seen this one in years.  To a lesbian, it's another one of those frustrating teasers like Fried Green Tomatoes or Boys on the Side where you know some of the characters are gay but nothing overtly gay is ever allowed to happen... Maddie is straight and can't even SAY the word ""lesbian,"" lol.  The plot is kinda silly.  The ending was sad and basically sucked.  I'm sure the book is far better, even if the setting is different (50s as opposed to 90s) and the girls are less pretty.  Yet it still blows on the 2012 movie version that was truer to the book.This works because Angelia Jolie makes it work.  She is the sensual and androgynous stranger (""Legs"") who comes from nowhere and draws together a group of women who fight against the men and societal rules that wrong them... their group is named Foxfire.  And she's got the charisma and seductive appeal to do exactly that.  I love her boyish clothes and short hair and the way the camera introduces her via those long, long legs and tough boots.  Dreamy!  She is that delicious mix of femme and butch all wrapped into one powerfully irresistible package.Angela Jolie in her Hackers and Foxfire days was just too cool.  And when she broke out in Gia a couple years later all long-haired femme and drop dead gorgeous, there just wasn't a more beautiful woman on the planet.  It's her beauty and unique persona that brings this film to life... her chemistry with Maddie was palpable.  Maddie is completely seduced by Legs.  Because Angelina completely embodies that mysterious cool chick in high school that completely immobilized you with her attentions.  And that's why this movie works.  That's why it's still better than every crappy element about it suggests it should be.Some of the straights don't consider this a ""lesbian"" movie at all... I wouldn't call it that either.  It's a story about bonding between women, really.  But the presence of Angelina and her seductive appeal to men and women alike... along with the introduction of Jenny Shimizu (as Goldie)... definitely gave the story a lez presence in a relatively recent time when we had very little presence at all in movies.  Nothing more than hugging and flirting/sexual tension between Legs and Maddie.  And one shirtless/boob shot of Angelina and some of the other girls during the tattooing scene.Nostalgic stuff and worth a watch if you missed it back in the day.

415545,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,6304341202,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[11, 12]","When Foxfire first came out, I had no interest to watch it at all. Recently I became a huge Angelina Jolie fan. The main reason to watch the movie was her. Jolie is great as usual. She gives everything into her character and is very good. The reason that films like these don't get as much publicity as their male counterparts is because they are all are so stereotyped and labeled. And while the generalization about most ""female bonding"" films is true, the same could be said about the men. And what makes each film stand apart is the emotion and ideas of the characters. The plot is based on real life situations, and the characters and the charisma they deliver is what makes the film so liberating and exciting to watch. The girls are learning life lessons, growing up, experimenting, facing hard issues and learning to cope and understand each other.Angelina Jolie has some brilliant lines and poses as an almost Mother-like figure, affecting their lives forever, sheltering and explaining, and persuading the girls to take an extra risk, or risks, rather. It's very intimate and she does an incredible job playing ""Legs"". It isn't meant to represent what all girls do, and don't bother looking for a movie about lesbians guys. It gets very ethereal at points and made a point about bonding and unity. Don't bother looking for deep intellectual comments either, because the most poignant scenes are sullen and the actresses use their eyes over words.The opening scenes are good, the way they introduce the oppressed victims, and you see the wide-eyed looks as are often given by people who are afraid - but who will later look for comfort in Legs and her new-found posse. It is all set up very well. And the touching ending scenes provide closure, showing how very real, and sincere, everything has been. It's not sugar coated in any way and let's you take a glimpse into a female perspective that does not revolve around whether or not they have a boyfriend, and whether their hair and make-up look okay. And if at least 1 girl can watch a movie like that, or read a book like that, and be inspired enough to raise her self-esteem and not let anyone walk over her, then it has made a good impact.

The movie is in a nice package.. music, dressing, etc., down to the minute details.  those details wouldn't be so insignificant if they ended in some sort of thing.. a climax, something useful.  Sometimes it seems like a nuttin dressed up, trying, trying really hard to be something real.  To mimic kids; hopefully not mocking; be symbolic, or just another teen flick.  But who is the exact target audience of this thing? Young girls... no too obvious.  It wouldn't hold the average 13 yr. old's interest, trust me on this one. Young women, certainly they would have gone past that by watching Clueless a few dozen times.  Any Male; perhaps, but only if the individual were poetic or in order to check out the cast with the likes of Angelina Jolie. Dont Worry Though, there is a bright side.  Even though there isnt much of a plot, if you are in an appropriate mood, the superb acting (by such a wonderful cast, such great actors), music, ideas, potential or hopefully its essense will keep your attention sealed. It has plot twists, but predictable ones.  (As far as poetic..) Well, I think the movie is what you make of it. It does have something about it; something I can't quite pinpoint, that makes it enjoyable.  And the chemistry between the girls is fabulous as they do things like saving each other from abusive teacher relationships, breaking into a school, and discovering each individual soul the way it should be.

It demonstrates and celebrates the separate identity that a woman must sometimes have. She by spends most of her time in the shadow of men, reliving what they have already done by the eyes of society and this scene showed them far removed from man all together. If a woman is thought of as strong, she is either a dyke or a ball buster. But a woman is never seen as strong and a woman. I feel this scene showed the true depth a woman is and by far the most incredible truth of a woman; she can be strong yet feminine. By revealing ONLY her breasts, she shows the nature of being a woman. By showing only the chest, she shows how separate she is from man. By showing only her breasts, she shows the essence of womanhood. And nothing is removed from her, not even a little bit. She shares her vulnerability enough to show that she really isn't vulnerable at all. It is a myth man places on women in order to keep them subdued and domestic. Foxfire is a celebration of two things, womanhood and friendship. This movies shows women taking back what most men don't see as valuable, a female's sexuality.

Not horribly wrong, really, just wrong.It starts off well enough. Honestly, ""well enough"" describes Haywood-Carter's first (and, to date, only) full-length feature for most of its length. Rita Faldes (Pleasantville's Jenny Lewis) is a mousy high school student who nearly has a breakdown in biology class when frog dissection day rolls around. That day, a stranger shows up and drops in on class-- Legs (Angelina Jolie). Everyone assumes she's a new student, so she passes without remark, at least until she stands up for Rita, then escapes through a window (with the frog). In detention after school, the teacher, Mr. Buttinger (Point Pleasant's John Diehl), puts the moves on Rita, and is stopped by a Legs-led cabal that also contains Maddy Wurtz (Boston Common beauty Hedy Burress), Violet Kuhn (Slaughter Party's Sarah Rosenberg)-- whom said teacher had also accosted-- and, as a latecomer, Goldie Goldman (The New Women's Jenny Shimizu). The five of them, flush with success, end up suspended for three weeks, during which time they bond at an abandoned house on the woods where Maddy often goes to indulge in her photography habit. As they grow more self-sufficient, however, they find themselves increasingly unable to fit into the conventional society beyond the woods.What is fundamentally wrong with the film is not, actually, the film itself-- most of it, anyway. The parallel between the growing power and self-assurance of the girls and their increasing outcast status is exceptionally well-handled, and that power and self-assurance is depicted with just the right amount of discomfort on both the parts of the girls and the parts of the viewers. As should be expected in any movie based on a novel by the redoubtable Joyce Carol Oates, there is a great deal of subtext to be had, and it all works quite nicely. For ninety-seven of the film's hundred two minutes, this is some good stuff, here.Then come the last five minutes, and everything goes down the tubes. Storylines simply disappear. Things which had been depicted subtly and effectively earlier in the film come back, and their symbolism is rammed down the viewer's throat. Characters disappear. It's as if a different, and incompetent, director took over for the film's final scenes.Final score: ** ?.

The inspiration for their newfound rebellion is from the 5th girl that brings the 4 others together, Legs, played phenomenally by Angelina Jolie. I must say this: I really don't care much for Ms. Jolie, and perhaps the media is to blame by making stories like her & Billy Bob and their whole blood thing the top news story, more recently her husband-stealing with Brad Pitt, but I cast aside those feelings for an hour and 40 minutes and found myself absolutely loving her performance. If you are like me and don't like her, please do give her a chance in this film. She's astonishingly good and I kept having to remind myself it was Angelina.As a matter of fact, the entire cast turns in memorable performances. I think this is a great movie for women to watch but I don't know if men will enjoy it quite as much. I did see one male reviewer claiming he didn't find it to be just a chick flick, but he might be the minority. Guy or gal, if the story sounds intriguing to you, and it really is, then Foxfire is definitely worth checking out. I give it only 4 stars simply because the character of Maddy (wonderfully played by Hedy Burress) has a boyfriend but she nevers breaks up with him and he kind of fizzles into the background. Left me wondering why he was even in the movie to begin with, but that's my only criticism.At this price, it's a fabulous addition to your collection, though believe it or not, the low price right here on Amazon has been beaten by Wal-Mart...it's in the $5.50 bin. This is a great movie that reminds us that sometimes people will make it difficult for you to do the right thing, but you must believe in yourself and stand for what you believe.

415564,AHG40G02AIW01,6304341202,"The Doughball ""Connoisseur of Fine Media""","[6, 7]","Foxfire is a film about the intense nature of friendship forged in unusual events, and about what friendship really is and isn't. Five girls come together who weren't previously friends when one confesses that a teacher sexually abuses her. Another of the five confirms her story and they decide to make it stop. What happens next is that they all risk a great deal to be there for the abused girls, and the friendship that comes out of the experience is unbreakable. Throughout the film they take care of each other in a way that you'd expect from family, which is telling of the fact that by taking risks for each other and being true friends they have formed bonds of real sisterhood. This is a movie that adolescent girls will appreciate especially, but all people will enjoy. The chord it strikes in people who seek true friends is something not easily forgotten. This movie is more than a chick flick, and it's more than a story about female rebellion, it's a celebration of the nature of real friendship.",4,I'm not one for chick flicks but I love this movie...,1033776000,"10 5, 2002",2002,1011,"['Foxfire', 'film', 'intense', 'nature', 'friendship', 'forged', 'unusual', 'events', 'what', 'friendship', 'really', ""n't"", 'Five', 'girls', 'come', 'together', 'who', 'were', ""n't"", 'previously', 'when', 'one', 'teacher', 'sexually', 'five', 'confirms', 'story', 'decide', 'make', 'stop', 'What', 'next', 'risk', 'great', 'deal', 'be', 'there', 'abused', 'girls', 'friendship', 'experience', 'unbreakable', 'film', 'take', 'care', 'other', 'way', ""'d"", 'expect', 'family', 'telling', 'fact', 'taking', 'risks', 'other', 'being', 'true', 'friends', 'have', 'formed', 'bonds', 'real', 'sisterhood', 'movie', 'adolescent', 'girls', 'will', 'appreciate', 'especially', 'people', 'will', 'enjoy', 'chord', 'people', 'who', 'seek', 'true', 'friends', 'something', 'not', 'easily', 'forgotten', 'movie', 'more', 'chick', 'flick', 'more', 'story', 'female', 'rebellion', 'celebration', 'nature', 'real', 'friendship']",Foxfire VHS

I'm a guy and I've loved this movie since the first time I saw it. Initially, I'll admit I was attracted to it because it featured two of my favorite  actresses(Jolie, Burress) but it was the story itself that has made me a  devoted viewer of this movie ever since.  The movie is miles and away  different from the book it's based on, and not just due to the setting. The  relationships between the girls are slightly altered, not to mention a good  number of the girls are left out. That in no way diminishes how dead on the  emotions each character portrays are played out.  Thelma and Louise?  Definitely a film made solely for the female audience.
