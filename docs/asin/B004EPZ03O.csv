1402547,A28PQ9EX1MDCXP,B004EPZ03O,A. Brattoli,"[17, 147]","I sat through this painful mess of a movie when it was released in the theatres. Honestly, I thought it wasn't possible to ruin a Muppet movie, or anything involving the Muppets for that matter, but this director and screenwriter managed to pull it off. It was so terrible I don't know where to start. Oh, let's try right from the beginning.Almost THIRTY MINUTES to develop a main character who is a Muppet playing a human being who wants to be a Muppet? THAT'S the big lead in? It should have taken 10 minutes of screen time, including the horrific song and dance which should have been shortened by two thirds. None of these characters, the aforementioned Muppet human, his human brother and his brother's fiance' are interesting in the least. This is the best story line the author could come up with? My girlfriend and I came up with 3 better storylines, which included much more screen time and jokes for the Muppets, during the 20 minute drive back home.The best parts of this movie required no thought, and that's exactly what it appears the author and director put into actually putting it on screen. A recreation of the old Muppets show (again, which could have been MUCH better), didn't have nearly enough gags (where was Lew Zealand? The Electric Mayhem? Pigs in Space?!?!), and wasted what could have been a GREAT guest star slot with Jack Black. The whole ""Telethon"" bit falls flat on its face. The best parts of the recreated show and this movie in its entirety are remakes of scenes lifted straight out of the Muppet Movie. The old songs, like the wonderful Why Are There So Many Songs About Rainbows, are also the best in this film. For all those who love the Muppets (including me) this was a travesty and an insult to Jim Henson and all the memories he created for us. Muppet lovers are better served by petitioning for the release of The Muppet Movie on Blu-ray and buying up copies of Muppets Take Manhattan (a disappointing second Muppet feature that is worlds away better than this mess of a film) and Muppets In Space.When I first saw the trailer for this film, I was ecstatic.

If you love the muppets, you'll enjoy this.This is good old fashioned leave your brains at the door corn regarding the beloved marionette puppets (thus the origin of the name if you've ever wondered) and their puppet within a human world admirer Walter. Walter and his human brother (don't ask) and the latter's girlfriend go on a mission to meet the Muppets, when he learns that their old theater may be taken over by a crooked oil tycoon (note-one of the fools at Faux Noose has accused this film of promoting anti-capitalism among the kiddies-moving right along). As was the case with the band in ""The Blues Brothers,"" the beloved Muppets are scattered all over the place at crummy jobs that they hate, and Walter tries to get them together on this mission to stop the crook.The film never takes itself too seriously. The crooked tycoon has a group of crude, pseudomuppets called ""The Moopets"" (the gangster rapping Fozzie Bear counterpart is a real hoot) that he intends to replace the lovable Muppets with. One song in the film is actually called ""Am I a Man or a Muppet"" and is sung straight (which makes it all the more funny). The song and dance numbers are jaw droppingly cornball. One really hilarious movement has a group of chickens clucking the lyrics to Cee Lo Greene's (Forget) You.Aduilts who grew up with the Muppets will enjoy this best. Tons of self-referencing humor. There is even a segment reviving ""The Rainbow Connection"" from the 1979 Muppet Movie and ""Manomenop"" from their pre-Sesame Street appearances on the Ed Sullivan Show in the late 60s. Incidentally, a kid sitting next to us asked his parents where were Elmo, Big Bird, and the rest of the Sesame Street crew. Kermit aside, legal issues prevented this and Frank Oz (the original voice of Fozzie Bear) did not care for the fart jokes (that and a scene involving moldy fruit are the only remotely offensive things about the film, its okay for the kids) and some aspects of the script. The kiddies will have a good time though. Overall, if you don't take it too seriously and let your inner child come out while watching this, you will enjoy it too.

1402559,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B004EPZ03O,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","Growing up on a healthy dose of The Muppets, I was so excited when I heard that Jason Segel was heading a revamp of the franchise.  It was like the little boy inside of me jumped for joy at the very thought of seeing one of these films through fresh eyes.  I told my daughter that I was taking her to see this film and she stared at me with this blank expression and uttered four words that stuck a dagger in my soul.""Who are The Muppets?""What has happened to children's entertainment?  Why are they fed nonsense in such an ingratiating manner, and if Sesame Street can survive, why have The Muppets all but died off?  I blame myself for not being assertive enough to force feed my daughter the shows I grew up on, and yet times have changed and I'm really busy!  Still, I was going to educate her, and so I thank Jason Segel for making my job a little easier.  I swooped up my daughter, called up my friend (who happens to have fathered her best friend) and we made our way to the local cinema for a daddy/daughter Muppet extravaganza.Totally worth it.My initial reaction after leaving the theater was one of unbridled glee.  I was in love with this movie.  From the moment Segel and company burst into song, dancing through the streets in brightly clad attire, I was brought back to my youth (early youth) and I honestly wanted to get up and dance.  I was so happy when my little angel actually did!  The film follows a little Muppet named Walter who grew up in a human house with his brother and best friend Gary.  When Walter and Gary learn that an oilman wants to destroy Muppet Theater in order to drill for oil, they set off to prevent that from happening.  Along the way, Walter finds his place in life, which is something he's struggled with growing up, never truly feeling at home even when he was at home.The way that the characters are explored here is fun and fresh, and Segel has fun integrating common movie clich&eacute;s in a way that is bright and humorous (as a way at poking fun at the typical rom-com).  There is so much joy in this film.  Upon reflection though, I have to admit that I was a tad let down by the finale.  I was waiting with baited breath for the actual `show' and when they finally put it one I was left wanting.  Sure, not at the moment (because, while in the moment, I was lapping it all up) but later as I thought about it, and when I saw it a second time, I was left with this feeling of disappointment, albeit slight.  The musical numbers were maybe too modern (clucking `Forget You' was a bit meh in my opinion) and it just didn't last long enough.That said, the original songs (including the Oscar winning `Muppet or a Man') are delicious and Chris Cooper is hilarious as the villain, Tex Richman.Maniacal laugh!!!!",4,Like a slice of my childhood!,1342483200,"07 17, 2012",2012,2760,"['Growing', 'up', 'healthy', 'dose', 'Muppets', 'was', 'so', 'excited', 'when', 'heard', 'Jason', 'Segel', 'was', 'heading', 'revamp', 'franchise', 'was', 'little', 'boy', 'jumped', 'joy', 'very', 'thought', 'seeing', 'one', 'films', 'fresh', 'eyes', 'told', 'daughter', 'was', 'taking', 'see', 'film', 'stared', 'blank', 'expression', 'uttered', 'four', 'words', 'stuck', 'dagger', 'soul', 'Who', 'are', 'Muppets', 'What', 'happened', 'children', 'entertainment', 'Why', 'are', 'fed', 'nonsense', 'such', 'ingratiating', 'manner', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'can', 'survive', 'why', 'have', 'Muppets', 'died', 'blame', 'not', 'being', 'assertive', 'enough', 'force', 'feed', 'daughter', 'shows', 'grew', 'up', 'yet', 'times', 'have', 'changed', ""'m"", 'really', 'busy', 'Still', 'was', 'going', 'educate', 'so', 'thank', 'Jason', 'Segel', 'making', 'job', 'little', 'easier', 'swooped', 'up', 'daughter', 'called', 'up', 'friend', 'who', 'have', 'fathered', 'best', 'friend', 'made', 'way', 'local', 'cinema', 'daddy/daughter', 'Muppet', 'extravaganza.Totally', 'worth', 'it.My', 'initial', 'reaction', 'leaving', 'theater', 'was', 'one', 'unbridled', 'glee', 'was', 'love', 'movie', 'moment', 'Segel', 'company', 'burst', 'song', 'dancing', 'streets', 'brightly', 'clad', 'attire', 'was', 'brought', 'back', 'youth', 'early', 'youth', 'honestly', 'wanted', 'get', 'up', 'dance', 'was', 'so', 'happy', 'when', 'little', 'angel', 'actually', 'did', 'film', 'little', 'Muppet', 'named', 'Walter', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'human', 'house', 'brother', 'best', 'friend', 'Gary', 'When', 'Walter', 'Gary', 'learn', 'oilman', 'destroy', 'Muppet', 'Theater', 'order', 'drill', 'oil', 'set', 'off', 'prevent', 'happening', 'way', 'Walter', 'place', 'life', 'something', 'struggled', 'growing', 'up', 'never', 'truly', 'feeling', 'home', 'even', 'when', 'was', 'home.The', 'way', 'characters', 'are', 'explored', 'here', 'fun', 'fresh', 'Segel', 'fun', 'integrating', 'common', 'movie', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'way', 'bright', 'humorous', 'way', 'poking', 'fun', 'typical', 'rom-com', 'so', 'much', 'joy', 'film', 'reflection', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'tad', 'let', 'down', 'finale', 'was', 'waiting', 'baited', 'breath', 'actual', 'show', 'when', 'finally', 'put', 'one', 'was', 'left', 'wanting', 'Sure', 'not', 'moment', 'moment', 'was', 'lapping', 'up', 'later', 'thought', 'when', 'saw', 'second', 'time', 'was', 'left', 'feeling', 'disappointment', 'slight', 'musical', 'numbers', 'were', 'maybe', 'too', 'modern', 'clucking', 'Forget', 'was', 'bit', 'meh', 'opinion', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'last', 'long', 'enough.That', 'said', 'original', 'songs', 'including', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'Muppet', 'Man', 'are', 'delicious', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'hilarious', 'villain', 'Tex', 'Richman.Maniacal', 'laugh']",The Muppets

Jason Segel is a great foil for these Muppets, while Walter himself is not a bad addition to the Muppets character lineup. The plot is easy to follow, and will hold everyone's attention spans for the running time (approx 1.75 hours). The only major complaint I have against the film is a really bad rap sequence somewhere in the middle that you'll know it when you see it. Fortunately, that's why there is a 'Skip' button on DVD or Blu-ray remotes. There are MANY great celebrity cameos which are a hallmark of Muppet movies.

1402561,A3F2VVIQIY6U64,B004EPZ03O,Armando N. Roman,"[3, 5]","If you were one of the unfortunate ones that saw The Muppets Wizard of Oz a few years ago, I don't think I need to explain why I went into this movie with very, very low expectations. Face it- the Muppets haven't done much since the early 90s, and to me, the last decent thing they had was The Muppet Christmas Carol. When I was younger, I'd always rent VHS tapes of The Muppet Show and Muppet Babies was one of the regular shows I'd watch on tv, but I can't say I was really a huge fan of them. All the bland movies over the last 10 years didn't help my stance on the matter. Sure, there were a couple of sketches and characters I liked a lot, but that was about it. When The Muppets hit theaters just a few months ago, there were seemingly no bad reviews- just tons of praise from viewers who had nothing but fond memories of the Muppets from their childhood. Honestly, it seemed like they made this movie seem better than it actually was, not letting go of the nostalgia. But I knew that this movie would be even slightly better than Muppets Wizard of Oz if only because of Jason Segel, someone who genuinely cares about puppetry.The Muppets' plot is simple Muppet-ish stuff: Gary is a human and his brother, Walter, is a Muppet (don't ask). They're close, always do things together, and both of them are huge fans of The Muppet Show. When the two go with Gary's girlfriend, Mary, on a little vacation, they take a trip to the original Muppet Studios- a dream come true! But when they get there, everything is in shambles. Buildings are dusty and devoid of life, and it turns out that a rich Texan oil man, Tex Richman, has bought the land that the studio is on, and plans to destroy everything to make way for oil drilling. Unless ten million dollars is raised within a few days to negate the contract, the studio is toast. So Walter and Gary find Kermit and convince him to get the gang back together and put on a show to save everything. Fozzie, Gonzo, Rowlf, Piggy, the Electric Mayhem Band, even secondary Muppets like Crazy Harry, Lips and Lew Zealand join the gang once more for what could be their last hurrah. Unfortunately, Gary's so distracted by this Muppet business that he forgets all about spending time with Mary, despite being a full-grown adult, and seems more concerned with Walter fitting in with the Muppet gang than anything. How will the relationship go with their 10th anniversary coming up?Yeah, it's nothing new, but it sure could've been worse (seriously, go watch The Muppets Wizard of Oz if you don't believe me). Something that worried me was that a lot of time would've been spent with Gary and Mary instead of the focus being on the Muppets, but that wasn't quite the case. Time is split between the two plots very well, with Kermit and the gang getting a good 75% of the screen time. The movie moves at a fast pace, and it was fun seeing them recruit everyone. Gonzo being a big time plumbing supply business man was nice, Fozie having a wanna-be group of Muppets to go on stage with was a good joke, and what happened to Animal is so good that I won't ruin the gag here. Really, there isn't any kind of big problem I have with the movie other than they played it too safe, and that jokes were a lot tamer than some of what was on The Muppet Show and a few of the better movies. There were a few times where I laughed a little bit, namely the Animal bit, what Rowlf was doing when they recruited him, a kidnapping bit that just plain looked funny in how a certain character moved, and a few minor sight gags. The Muppets is easily accessible to people of all ages. My daughter is 5 years old, and she LOVES this movie, already having the songs memorized, and cracks up during the 'Muppet Or A Man' bit.Even though I say there's no big problem I have with the movie, it's still pretty plain. Walter is as generic as you can get, and his big talent that comes into play towards the end is so lame that I thought it was a joke, and that his real talent was going to be revealed after what he did. I also can't stand the new voice actor for Rowlf. Yes, I get that he was silent for so many years after Jim Henson's death out of respect, and I appreciate that, but this guy sounds nothing like Rowlf. He was better off staying silent in all honesty. Some of the Muppet movements are off too, and this isn't coming from some hardcore Muppet fanatic. Kermit's signature arm shaking isn't as crazy as it should be, and there were a lot of times where certain Muppets' mouth movements were off. These are just little nitpicks, and won't apply to most people, but it distracted me from enjoying the movie. Oh well, at least Uncle Deadly, one of my favorites, finally got some good screen time! And for those worried about the use of CG in the movie, don't worry- it's used sparingly, and was mostly used to eliminate wires/rods on the Muppets' arms, but is also used for a couple of scenes.Something I never liked about the old Muppet movies was how dark and faded everything looked. It always put me down to see such a lively cast of characters like that. Well, that problem is long gone on the blu-ray. Colors pop out at you, are lush and will really make use of your tv. Leave it to Disney to make sure the picture quality is top notch on home releases. You can see every tiny detail on the Muppets if you look hard enough. The audio quality gets equally good treatment with a 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track. Yes, it's more than the movie needs, since there aren't giant robots flying around blowing things up, so what? It helps the musical numbers more than anything else.As far as the special features go, this combo pack got a good amount of extras, though it's not as much as you might expect for the first major Muppet movie in years. First up is a commentary track with Jason Segel, executive producer/co-writer Nicholas Stoller, and director James Bobin. The guys give out tons of fun facts and information about how the film came to be, and it's always good to hear from Segel, who really knows his stuff when it comes to puppetry and the Muppets. He's been good on commentary tracks before, and he continues to be fun to listen to here. There's an 8 minute 'The Longest Blooper Reel Ever. At Least In Muppet History...We Think', and I'll just let the name of this feature speak for itself. It's amusing, but goes on longer than it should. Also on here are 13 minutes of deleted scenes and an alternate ending which is a little unsettling compared to what they went with for the final cut. Finally are a quick faux script reading, a short featurette about the making of the movie (way better than any 'making of' I've seen over the last couple of years), and some spoof trailers, which to me were the best thing on here. And it's worth noting that every time you pause the movie, you get one of many different intermission sequences with Statler and Waldorf, live action sequences or previews of other extras. It's quality over quantity here. And if you go with the 3 disc package, there's also a code to download the soundtrack, but you have to get it through the Disney Movie Rewards site, where you get to download a Zip file after entering the code. It's annoying, but hey, you still get the soundtrack for free.I watched the movie just a few hours ago, and when it was over, I went on with the rest of my night, not thinking much about it. There wasn't a lasting impression that was left on me, but again, it's still a heck of a lot better than say...Muppets Wizard of Oz. To me, the movie could've been better if they ditched the Walter and Gary characters and made it be 100% about the Muppets. Amy Adams was more or less wasted, apart from showing off her singing talents a few times, and the slew of celebrity guests are mostly in blink-and-you-miss-them roles. Still, there are worse ways to spend an hour and a half of your time, and no matter what I say, hardcore Muppet fans will adore his no matter what. If you're a casual fan, it's worth a rental.",3,No drums! No drums!

1402563,A35X5JMZE3MPKY,B004EPZ03O,"Astral ""Astral""","[3, 17]","The Muppets were beloved because everyone liked to see bits about their favorite characters - be at interaction between the Swedish chefs, Fonzie's bad jokes or the play between Kermit and Miss Piggy.  This new Muppets movie ditches most of that for new characters, a few humans and a Muppet that was raised as a human (a manly muppet?).  The Muppet theater is in danger and of course this man muppet newcomer is the only one who can save it, by bringing the crew back together again.  A few musical numbers and some shallow political digs, and the movie is basically over, with a slap dash ending to put the beast to rest.Through the years the muppets all have carved lives out for themselves, more or less, and even the successful Miss Piggy tosses it all away for a chance to save the little muppet theater.  A grand notion of course, but not a realistic one (but then again, when is this supposed to be realistic?).  The first musical number is charming and quaint with some cute sight gags but it is the only one... the rest are unbearably cheesy and predictable.  And that's probably the best word for the movie right there, predictable.  It feels false, fabricated and made simply to play on nostalgic emotions.  Everything is seen through rose colored glasses and when they finally get their chance to make themselves ""relevant"" once again (after Kermit continually points out how washed up and forgotten they are), their grand return pretty much fizzles.  Jack Black as the captive host for their Muppet telathon, could have been a savior, but he's left as a set piece that is more window dressing and presence than anything else.Will you like it?  If you enjoyed The Muppets in the past, you might find this sappy, slapped together movie a half-hearted romp through days gone by.

1402565,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B004EPZ03O,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[11, 14]","Let me start right off by saying that ""The Muppets"" is a great, big, warm hug of a movie. It's the kind of movie they just don't make anymore. Joyous, uplifting, funny, sweet, touching, entertaining, etc. You can have all your newer cartoons and CGI creations. Give me Kermit and the gang any day of the week. It's been a long time since the gang were in such a major movie, and this is one of the best 'Welcome Back' movies I have ever seen.Jason Segal (who also co-wrote) the movie stars as Gary, a nice guy with a muppet brother named Walter. Walter is a big fan of the Muppets. When Gary and his girlfriend, Mary (Amy Adams), take a trip to Los Angeles, Walter gets to come along. They tour the now derelict Muppet studios where, Walter learns, an evil oil tycoon (the game Chris Cooper) plans of tearing down the studios. In a last ditch effort, Walter and Gary go to Kermit to try to get the old gang back together again. Kermit agrees and he rounds up the old gang and stages a telethon to save the Muppet studios.""The Muppets"" is a movie for the kid in everyone. It is certainly a movie that the kids will love, but it's a movie their parents will love. In fact, it may mean more to them than the kids. The Muppets' history goes back decades, and this movie definitely coasts on the nostalgia factor of the old ""Muppet Show"" television series. A lot of that storyline, as well as some jokes and cameos, will be only for the adults and over most kids' heads. Don't think that this will divide the audience for the movie. You don't need to know everything. You just need to know how to have fun and be entertained. This movie delivers in spades. There is a lot of referential humor here and, like past movies, is littered with celebrity cameos. Some will be unknown to the kiddies (Mickey Rooney, Alan Arkin), but others will be more universal (Jack Black, Whoopi Goldberg, Selena Gomez, Neil Patrick Harris) and others. But the real draw, of course, are the Muppets. It is a joy to see these characters again in all their glory. The only disappointing thing is that maybe got a shorter end of the stick than others. Still, everyone has their moment, and it's just good to see them again. Human-wise, Segal and Adams are so likeable and game for anything in their roles. You know they just had a blast making this movie. Music-wise, the movie delivers. The new songs are wonderful, there are classic hits, and the famous Muppet song, ""The Rainbow Connection"" makes an appearance as well.""The Muppets"" is a movie that does nostalgia right. It delivers all the watm, fond memories, but also keeps things current(the gang has to deal with how irrelevant the world now sees them as). It touches your heart, tickles your funny bone, and lifts your spirits. There have not been many movies like this in years. ""The Muppets"" is a treat. Plain and simple.

Amy Adams is the beautiful and innocent love interest. Rotten Tomatoes gave the movie a 97% movie critic positive rating.So, what happened? Why did this movie fail at the box office. Did it have anything to do with the Fox News controversy about the bad guy being an oil tycoon. Absolutely not. This movie failed at the box office because it really doesn't have a heart. All of the muppets are there, and there is singing and dancing. Funny jokes and quality writing abound, but I never found one moment to latch on to, one moment that felt real.I may be wrong on why this movie didn't win over the public, but you can't deny that something is missing. Maybe, the movie didn't take itself seriously enough. There are a few times when Segal or the muppets talk directly to the audience about major plot points or the movie budget.Bottom line, this is an enjoyable movie.

However, the story was incredibly basic, you can pretty much boil it down to being a redemption story where Kermit, inspired by the actions of two brothers and an evil oil magnate, reforms the Muppets and they put on a benefit show. There were also several unbelievable parts (for example there being millions of dollars of oil under the Muppets Studio in LA, and a dues ex machina ending where the evil character has a change of heart), but let's face it, this is a Muppet movie and no one expects an interesting or complex realistic story. I did however, have some problems with the musical numbers. Most of the new songs mainly featured the mediocre humans (even though I love Jason Segel), with the Muppets everyone loves either not being featured at all or only as cameos. Then most of the musical numbers that did feature the main Muppets were rehashed Classics, which while I still love and elicit fond memories, I can experience the higher quality versions (with the original voices) when I watch the older Muppet movies.Still, it was great to see the Muppets in action again, and I'm happy that today's young generation now has their own Muppet movie to watch.",4,Welcome Back Muppets,1338249600,"05 29, 2012",2012,1254,"['Being', 'fan', 'Muppets', 'pretty', 'much', 'entire', 'life', 'course', 'loved', 'movie', 'However', 'story', 'was', 'incredibly', 'basic', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'boil', 'down', 'being', 'redemption', 'story', 'where', 'Kermit', 'inspired', 'actions', 'two', 'brothers', 'evil', 'oil', 'magnate', 'Muppets', 'put', 'benefit', 'show', 'were', 'also', 'several', 'unbelievable', 'parts', 'example', 'being', 'millions', 'dollars', 'oil', 'Muppets', 'Studio', 'LA', 'dues', 'ex', 'machina', 'ending', 'where', 'evil', 'character', 'change', 'heart', 'let', 'face', 'Muppet', 'movie', 'one', 'interesting', 'complex', 'realistic', 'story', 'did', 'however', 'have', 'problems', 'musical', 'numbers', 'Most', 'new', 'songs', 'mainly', 'featured', 'mediocre', 'humans', 'even', 'love', 'Jason', 'Segel', 'Muppets', 'everyone', 'not', 'being', 'featured', 'only', 'cameos', 'Then', 'most', 'musical', 'numbers', 'did', 'feature', 'main', 'Muppets', 'were', 'rehashed', 'Classics', 'still', 'love', 'elicit', 'fond', 'memories', 'can', 'experience', 'higher', 'quality', 'versions', 'original', 'voices', 'when', 'watch', 'older', 'Muppet', 'movies.Still', 'was', 'great', 'see', 'Muppets', 'action', 'again', ""'m"", 'happy', 'today', 'young', 'generation', 'now', 'own', 'Muppet', 'movie', 'watch']",The Muppets

They are one thing that should make us proud as humans, a tradition that shall never die, a source of happiness that shall never end. Maybe for that reason several movies and TV shows about the Muppets have been done since the first film in 1979, which was released before season four of ""The Muppet Show."" This new 2011 version, simply called ""The Muppets,"" lives up to its expectations and carries the spirit of its predecessors. It is one truly fun and delightful film for all the family.""The Muppet"" is described as a ""live-action musical feature film,"" which means that, in addition to the story, there are some musical elements to it. On this occasion, the story begins in a town simply referred to as SmallTown, USA. It is there that we find brothers Gary (Jason Segel) and Walter (the Muppet). We see them when they are small, and as they grow and mature. The problem is, Gary grows up, but Walter stays small. Despite their differences, they love each other and live a happy life. Both of them, too, enjoyed watching ""The Muppet Show"" on TV. But for Walter it was much more than a TV show -- it was a revelation. He indentified with the Muppets - he was one of them --, and Kermit the Frog became his hero.One day, Gary tells Walter the he and Mary (Amy Adams), his girlfriend, were going to Hollywood and that he was invited to go with them. Walter was told that one of the stops while visiting town was the famous Muppets Studio. As you can imagine, Walter was very happy and couldn't wait to get there. Once they visit the studios, they become disillusioned because the place was almost in ruins and forgotten. Walter silently gets away from the studio tour, and sneaks inside one of the buildings. He hears voices and hides. One of the voices that hears is that of Tex Richman (Chris Cooper), a powerful businessman that wants to buy the studios, so that he can demolish them and pump the oil reserve that lies beneath. This, of course, upsets Walter, who notifies Gary and Mary about Richman's cruel intentions. The three of them go to Kermit's mansion, to convince him to try to stop Richman. Kermit is now retired from show business. However, Walter manages to convince him to get the gang together. Enter all of our friends - Fozzie Bear, Animal, Swedish Chef, Gonzo, Scooter, and, of course, Miss Piggy --, and, with the involuntary help of Veronica Martin (Rashida Jones), they will save the day.I really enjoyed ""The Muppets,"" and, at this point, it seems that I don't get tired of them. Never mind that the film is loaded with guests, such as Jack Black, Whoopi Goldberg, Alan Arkin, Emily Blunt, James Carville, Neil Patrick Harris, Sarah Silverman, and more.

1402578,A2VRYMER23944K,B004EPZ03O,CAS MARINO,"[0, 0]","On a bored and nappy afternoon, I rented this on Amazon Prime.I love this movie. I love the Muppets in general. And above all, I love the fact that the Muppet's brand of self-effacing humor not only pleases the youngest AND the oldest members of the family with jokes and entendres that land where they're intended on each audience, but it also realizes how lucky a franchise is to hold its appeal with a viewer who grew up on ""Sesame Street"" and now has youngsters that find the same family of creatures just as heartwarming and engaging.Kermit, as their leader, never assumes you still adore him; rather, he keeps giving you reasons to find him lovable, and he thanks you for that. And these furry beings don't behave (as many Disney creations do) as if it's still the 1960s. They know their time and potential untimeliness, and they work hard to overcome the generation gaps that make so many other former favorites obsolete.This is a movie that pokes as much fun at itself as possible, and it's all the more endearing because of how conscious it is of how unendearing it could have been.I'll watch this every couple of months.

1402583,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B004EPZ03O,Chris Kennison,"[8, 11]","The Muppet's last movie, ""Muppet's from Space"" was released in 1999 and ""The Muppet Show"" finished its television run in 1981 and this is the premise of the ""Muppets 2011"" revival movie. After years of absence, the Muppet's are back. For many people who grew up in the late 70's and early 80's, this isn't just a children's movie, this is a return to their childhood. Those who remember ""The Muppet Show"" will be reminded how a collection of felt characters with all different personalities, would attempt to put on a variety show every week.""The Muppets"" 2011 is an absolute delight for a child who hasn't been exposed to the characters yet, as well as the child at heart who was longing for their return and didn't even realize it. The spirit of the Muppets is quickly established with a lighthearted delivery, song and dance and doing what the Muppets have always done by making puppets made of felt and cloth come to life. We are introduced to a Muppet named Walter who's brother, a human, changed and grew over time, while he stayed his same old Muppet self. Ever since the television show left the air in 1981, Walter had longed to be a part of a television show that was put on by people, or Muppets, like him. Out of place and never having his dream fulfilled, he finally gets his chance.The new movie is a collage of real life and movie. In the movie, we watch as the Muppets who have had a 12-year hiatus and are leading private sector lives, come together to bring back their television show and that is exactly what is happening in real life. The Muppets are back! There are moments in the movie too that made me feel how much I missed them. There are also moments that made me think of how the creators, Jim Hensen and Frank Oz are also gone and can't see how much the Muppets meant to us growing up.""The Muppets"" is quite simply a joy worthy of repeat viewing. There are people who break out into song and dance at the most inappropriate times, like sitting at a diner or chickens clucking to C-Lo Green's ""Forget You"". The songs are catchy. The story is fun. The Muppets personalities are just like we remembered them. It was like dusting off an old record and letting yourself go. I had almost forgot how long it had been since a movie had done that to me.The only thing I can say negatively about ""The Muppets"" is that it will leave you with a sense of disappointment. It is inevitable, especially for those who remember the show. Although it is disappointment in a good way because you know how much there is to the Muppets and you can't help but want more. Hopefully there will be more and hopefully they will continue to bring the Muppets back into our lives on a regular basis.",5,MUPPETS ARE BACK,1322352000,"11 27, 2011",2011,2698,"['Muppet', 'last', 'movie', 'Muppet', 'Space', 'was', 'released', '1999', 'Muppet', 'Show', 'finished', 'television', 'run', '1981', 'premise', 'Muppets', '2011', 'revival', 'movie', 'years', 'absence', 'Muppet', 'are', 'back', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'late', '70', 'early', '80', ""n't"", 'just', 'children', 'movie', 'return', 'childhood', 'who', 'remember', 'Muppet', 'Show', 'will', 'be', 'reminded', 'how', 'collection', 'felt', 'characters', 'different', 'personalities', 'would', 'attempt', 'put', 'variety', 'show', 'week', 'Muppets', '2011', 'absolute', 'delight', 'child', 'who', ""n't"", 'been', 'exposed', 'characters', 'yet', 'as', 'well', 'child', 'heart', 'who', 'was', 'longing', 'return', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'realize', 'spirit', 'Muppets', 'quickly', 'established', 'lighthearted', 'delivery', 'song', 'dance', 'doing', 'what', 'Muppets', 'have', 'always', 'done', 'making', 'puppets', 'made', 'felt', 'come', 'life', 'are', 'introduced', 'Muppet', 'named', 'Walter', 'who', 'brother', 'human', 'changed', 'grew', 'time', 'stayed', 'same', 'old', 'Muppet', 'self', 'Ever', 'television', 'show', 'left', 'air', '1981', 'Walter', 'had', 'longed', 'be', 'part', 'television', 'show', 'was', 'put', 'people', 'Muppets', 'place', 'never', 'having', 'dream', 'fulfilled', 'finally', 'chance.The', 'new', 'movie', 'collage', 'real', 'life', 'movie', 'movie', 'watch', 'Muppets', 'who', 'have', 'had', '12-year', 'hiatus', 'are', 'leading', 'private', 'sector', 'lives', 'come', 'together', 'bring', 'back', 'television', 'show', 'exactly', 'what', 'happening', 'real', 'life', 'Muppets', 'are', 'back', 'are', 'moments', 'movie', 'too', 'made', 'feel', 'how', 'much', 'missed', 'are', 'also', 'moments', 'made', 'think', 'how', 'creators', 'Jim', 'Hensen', 'Frank', 'Oz', 'are', 'also', 'gone', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'much', 'Muppets', 'meant', 'growing', 'up', 'Muppets', 'quite', 'simply', 'joy', 'worthy', 'repeat', 'viewing', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'break', 'out', 'song', 'dance', 'most', 'inappropriate', 'times', 'sitting', 'diner', 'chickens', 'clucking', 'C-Lo', 'Green', 'Forget', 'songs', 'are', 'catchy', 'story', 'fun', 'Muppets', 'personalities', 'are', 'just', 'remembered', 'was', 'dusting', 'off', 'old', 'record', 'letting', 'go', 'had', 'almost', 'forgot', 'how', 'long', 'had', 'been', 'movie', 'had', 'done', 'me.The', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'negatively', 'Muppets', 'will', 'leave', 'sense', 'disappointment', 'inevitable', 'especially', 'who', 'remember', 'show', 'disappointment', 'good', 'way', 'know', 'how', 'much', 'Muppets', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'want', 'more', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'hopefully', 'will', 'continue', 'bring', 'Muppets', 'back', 'lives', 'regular', 'basis']",The Muppets

1402594,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B004EPZ03O,DanD,"[2, 2]","I expected to like THE MUPPETS.  I did not expect to love it.  And yet, I do.  Family films are a hard sell for me, I'll admit this right off the bat.  The laughs usually come at the expense of intelligence, and the heartwarming ending is usually tacked on.  I prefer my movies gritty and bitter, and decidedly non-child-friendly.Leave it to the Muppets to break the rules and create a family film that is actually good.  It's a simple story rooted in the idol worship many of us feel towards our felt friends: young man Walter is a huge fan of the Muppets; in them, he sees everything he is meant to be.  But when Walter discovers that the Muppets are has-beens, and that an oil tycoon wants to tear it down to drill for oil (""There's oil under this theater; I can smell it, and more importantly, the geological survey says there definitely is""), he and his older brother Gary set out, along with Gary's reluctant fiancee, to reunite the Muppets and raise ten million dollars.  ....And cue the Muppet shenanigans!This is Jason Segal's love letter to his childhood.  His pure, unadulterated joy helps propel the film; matching him step-for-step is Amy Adams, who's done this sort of thing before.  Chris Cooper makes a delightful villain (and seeing the studious actor break into a rap song is just...well, it's just awesome), and the slew of celebrity cameos helps keep things interesting.  The real stars here, of course, are the Muppets themselves, and it's nice to see them in fine theatrical form, parodying their former fame while recapturing it perfectly via sight-gags, intricate and hilarious song numbers (""Man or Muppet"" won a Best Song Oscar for a reason), and heaping helpings of nostalgia.Make no mistake though: for the young'uns, there's quite a bit of conventional humor; and for those of you who are older and maybe unfamiliar with the Muppets (you heathens), there are quite a few more adult-oriented jokes: meta-humor, quick gags, parodies of other films, an all-chicken rendition of Cee-Lo Green's ""F*** You"" (in a kids movie! Genius!).  The end result is a film that actually manages to equal more than the sum of its parts: it's a truly great family film, one that can be enjoyed by everyone from tots, to teens, to adults, to puppets.  Cue up THE MUPPETS, sit back, and prepare to spend the next hour and a half laughing your socks off.  And if you start to feel something warm growing around your heart?  Don't panic.

1402595,AQLPABVVH2WF7,B004EPZ03O,Daniel S Tommie,"[10, 13]","There is a wide spread misunderstanding on what a family film is. Most people don't know, and unfortunately it seems most movie studios don't know. A family film is not a kid movie. A kid movie is almost literally a poor man's family film.A kid movie only sets out to entertain children, and that doesn't take much. Bright colors and upbeat music is enough to make kids happy most times. As movies go, kid movies are a pretty safe bet. They're usually cheap, quick and easy to make and usually make money. Someone may be able to prove me wrong, but I don't think there is a such things as a good kid movie. Throw a rock at a movie marquee and you'll hit about three kid movies.A family film is a completely different animal. They are meant for the entire family, and not just trying to appeal to the lowest common denominator. They supply things that the intelligent movie goer expect to find. Characters with depth and progression. A story with a beginning, middle and end. A mediocre family film will have moments come and go which are recognizable as peddling to certain demographics. A good family film will feel as if every moment is for everyone. The Muppets is such a movie.I expected to enjoy this movie. I did not expect to love it. Oh man, was this movie good. I don't really know how to start. Well, I guess the beginning is a good a place as any. There's a few things you could say The Muppets is about. It's a little bit of a coming of age story, a little bit of a movie about the relationship between brothers and a little bit about the relationship between a man and a woman. Or occasionally a frog and a pig.In the first case the movie is about Walter [Peter Linz (puppeteer and voice)], a newly introduced... well... Muppet, but that's not entirely correct in the mythology of this film, as Muppet refers solely to the performers of The Muppet Show, kind of like despite popular belief every Englishman is not in Monty Python. Here's what we'll do: muppet (small `m') will refer to the Henson created puppet, while Muppet (big `M') will refer to a member of The Muppets.Starting over. In the first case the movie is about Walter [Peter Linz (puppeteer and voice)], a newly introduced muppet who grew up watching The Muppet Show. Being the only muppet in his idyllic Real America small town, The Muppet Show gave him something to relate to. In that regard I suppose The Muppet Show is kind of like muppexploitation. As such Walter leaps at the chance to join his brother Gary [Jason Segel] and his girlfriend Mary [Amy Adams] on their big trip to LA. For Walter it is very much a pilgrimage to... Mupecca.The relationship between Walter and Gary (not a muppet, by the way) is charming. Also a little cutesy as the two seem to live in a bit of a state of arrested development. This is for three reasons, I'd say. Gary's devotion to his muppet brother, their existence in this town plucked straight from Leave it to Beaver and lastly because I think they're both kind of man-boys. Or occasionally muppet-boy. In that regard the movie is as much of a coming of age story for Gary as it is for Walter.Interestingly the relationship between Gary and Mary feels flatter than the one between Kermit and Miss Piggy. But that's more praise for the ability of the muppets to come across as real characters with real emotion than it is an indictment of the human performance. The human romance is given a sense of reality by the difficulty it's faced to overcome, but the muppet equivalent has very parallel themes while also being performed by hands in felt.The Muppets does just about everything right. The cameos are just good fun. The musical numbers are generally great, one or two of them struck me as falling just below the mark, but not enough to really take me out of it. The level of nostalgia felt just about right. It plucked the right heart strings without seeming like it was excluding the younger crowd for who wouldn't understand the history. I really enjoyed Jack Black in this movie. That's the first time I've been able to say that for years. I was constantly impressed with how much character and emotion could be delivered from a puppet which so often you just don't get from computer animated characters. Hear that Lucas?There are very many places in this movie where it could have gone horribly wrong. I think the movie is protected by that it knows what it is and knows what it isn't. It has no problem poking a little fun at itself or light heartedly breaking the fourth wall. For example, the antagonist is a very stereotypical evil rich guy. But instead of playing it straight and being a glaring fault the film has fun with it. The dude's name is Mr Richman. He doesn't maniacally laugh. He says ""Maniacal laugh.""The movie is also very aware, and in some cases about, that The Muppets have largely been out of the public eye for a long time and that people might not care about them. I don't know how much of that was an actual concern in the making of the movie, but it seems that people have responded by saying ""Yes we do.""5 out of 5 hands in felt.",5,It's time to raise the

1402598,A3UUGZRTBS81YN,B004EPZ03O,David W. Jones,"[1, 1]","What a fun movie!  Thirty years have passed since The Muppet Show aired its last episode.  Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear and the rest of the cast have all scattered to individual pursuits.  Their old television studio sits in ruins.  A young fan named Walter (actually a muppet himself) visits the studio with his brother Gary (Jason Segel) and Gary's longtime girlfriend Mary (Amy Adams), to fulfill a lifetime dream.  While there, he overhears the evil plot of oil baron Tex Richman (Chris Cooper), who is planning to take over the studio and destroy it for the oil that lies underneath.  The only way out is to raise $10 million . . . and soon.  Walter purposes to reunite the Muppets for a fund-raising telethon to save the studio and thereby the Muppet legacy.  Can they raise the money in time?  Or does no one care anymore about the Muppets?This movie has it all--sympathetic characters, action, comedy, romance and musical numbers.  And it all works.  Particularly hilarious are the multiple times that the actors ""break the fourth wall"" and speak directly to the audience about the movie.  An extensive number of cameos by well-known actors round out the fun.Critics were pleased as well.  Rotten Tomatoes gives it an impressive 96% rating.  With this film, Segel has successfully reinvigorated the Muppet franchise.  A sequel has already been announced.The blu-ray transfer is top-notch.  Audio and visual are both strong.

1402599,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B004EPZ03O,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[0, 0]","It all began back in 1954.A high school student named Jim Henson was working at WTOP-TV and creating puppets for a children's show known as ""The Junior Morning Show"".  Henson would continue making puppets as a Freshman at the University of Maryland, College Park as the teenager would go on to create the financially successful show ""Sam and Friends"" for WRC-TV.  The five minute show would feature a prototype of a character known as ""Kermit the Frog"".This would lead to Henson working on a public television children's shown known as ""Sesame Street"" in the late '60s where Kermit the Frog would appear as a news reporter.This would lead to Jim Henson creating a British/American television show known as ""The Muppets"" which premiered in 1976 and a total of five series were produced until March 1981 and lasting 120 episodes.  The show known for its parodies and slapstick would feature many celebrity guests and through the series, Jim Henson and Frank Oz would create additional characters to join Kermit the Frog such as Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, Scooter, Gonzo, the Swedish Chef, Rowlf the Dog, Dr. Bunsen Honeydew, Beaker, the band Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem, Camilla the Chicken, Sam the Eagle, Statler and Waldorf, Link Hogthrob, Rizzo the Rat and many more.Although the television series ended, ""The Muppets"" would continue in the big screen with ""The Muppet Movie"" (1979), ""The Great Muppet Caper"" (1981), ""The Muppets Take Manhattan"" (1984), ""The Muppet Christmas Carol"" (1992), ""Muppet Treasure Island"" (1996) and ""Muppets from Space"" (1999).While a musical telefilm was created in 2005 titled ""The Muppets' Wizard of Oz"", the masses have not seen ""The Muppets"" for a long time and the last film was back in 1999.  Many have felt the characters have run its course and it was over, while others felt that without Jim Henson (who passed away in 1990), it would be difficult to continue ""The Muppets"" legacy.In 2008, actor Jason Segel (""How I Met Your Mother"", ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"") and writer/filmmaker Nicholas Stoller (""Fun with Dick and Jane"", ""Get Him to the Greek"", ""Yes Man"") wanted to bring back the Muppets and so the two pitched the concept to Walt Disney and next thing you know, the film would be greenlighted and filmmaker James Bobin (""The Flight of the Conchords"", ""Da Ali G Show"") would directed, while Jason Segel and Nicholas Stoller would be responsible for writing (Segel would also star in the film).Cast alongside Jason Segel would be Amy Adams (""The Fighter"", ""Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian"", ""Julie & Julia"", ""Enchanted"") and Chris Cooper (""American Beauty"", ""The Bourne Identity"", ""Adaptation"") as the antagonist.  The film would also feature talents such as Jack Black, Rashida Jones, Alan Arkin, Zach Galifianakis, Ken Jeong, Jim PArsons, Kristen Schaal, Eddie Pepitone, Sarah Silverman, Donald Glover, Emily Blunt, Leslie Feist, Whoopi Goldberg, Selena Gomez, Neil Patric Harris, Judd Hirsch, Kohn Krasinski, Mickey Rooney and more.The film would receive positive reviews from film critics and would be a success at the box office making over $158 million.  And now, ""The Muppets"" will be released on Blu-ray and DVD in March 2012.VIDEO:""The Muppets"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1).  The film looks absolutely fantastic on Blu-ray.  You can literally see the detail in the fur of the Muppets, to the skin pores of the human talent.  The clarity, the detail and the beautiful colors featured throughout the film are vibrant and because the film utilizes a lot of color, reds and greens really do pop.  Skintones are natural and black levels are nice and deep.I didn't see any banding or artifacts, if anything, videophiles should be happy with the overall picture quality is flawless!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:I absolutely love how Disney is focusing on 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio lossless soundtracks.  As expected from this film that utilizes so much music, dialogue and music is crystal clear coming through the center and front channels.  There is good use of surround channels as well from the audience of the live show to the music being utilized.The soundtrack is absolutely immersive, especially panning from varying sides coming from the surround channels (especially during the fireworks scene). Also, the LFE is used during scenes of accidents and there is also a good amount of ambiance that utilizes the surround channels as well.  I was pretty impressed as even when the scenes are shown backstage, you can then hear the audience still in the background from the rear or surround channels, you can hear the flickering of the lights to even when one gets on the stage.Like the video, audiophiles will enjoy this lossless soundtrack because it is equally flawless and no hissing or any audio problems were detected at all.SPECIAL FEATURES""The Three Musketeers"" comes with the following special features:Disney Intermission - Groundbreaking Blu-ray feature. Pausing a movie will never be this much fun, as the Muppets take over the screen every time you stop the disc!  Whenever you pause, you get an intermission with music, audio from the Muppets, or the Muppets themselves showing up on screen or even a theater like look at the special features.Scratching The Surface: A Hasty Examination of the Making of Disney's ""The Muppets."" - (15:56) Hosted by unit production manager monster J.G., the cast and crew take a behind the scenes look at making Muppet and movie history.The Longest Blooper Reel Ever Made (In Muppet History--We Think) - (8:33) Featuring funny gaffs and gags from behind the scenes of making Disney's ""The Muppets.""A Little Screen Test on the way to the Read Through. - (3:19) This hilarious footage follows the Muppet gang as they go to their first table reading of the script.Explaining Evil: The Full Tex Richman Song -(2:38) This is the longer rap sequence featuring Tex Richman which goes into details of why he dislikes the Muppets.Deleted Scenes - (10:01) Featuring eight deleted scenes: ""Walter's Nightmare,"" ""Life's A Happy Song Missing Verse,"" ""A Hero in Hollywood,"" ""Credit Card Club,"" ""Muppets in Jail,"" ""Bowling for Beaker,"" ""The Strip Mall Awards"" and ""The Complete Muppet Telethon Opening & More"".Theatrical Spoof Trailers - (9:00) Featuring seven spoof trailers: ""Rise of the Muppets,"" ""Never"" ""Green with Envy,"" ""The Fuzzy Pack,"" ""Being Green,"" ""The Piggy with the Froggy Tattoo"" and ""Green with Envy, the Spoof Spoof Trailer.""Audio Commentary with Jason Segel, James Bobin and Nicholas Stoller - A not-so-serious audio commentary by Jason Segel (executive producer/co-writer/actor , executive producer/co-writer Nicholas Stoller and director James Bobin.  The three discuss the movie but also joke around a lot during the commentary as well.  It would have been great to feature another commentary track with the puppeteers and crew, to give a more in-depth commentary on the making of the film.EXTRAS:""The Muppets: The Wocka Wocka Value Pack"" comes with a Blu-ray, DVD version of the film, Digital Copy and a code to download the film's soundtrack online.

In fact, back in junior high and my earlier years of high school, watching the show every Monday through Friday was like an addictive ritual before heading off to school.But like many children who grew up with ""The Muppets"", I got older and ""The Muppets"" became nothing more but a memory of my childhood and early teenage years.So, when I first heard of ""The Muppets"" making a return to the big screen and that Jason Segel and Nick Stoller were involved in rejuvenating the franchise, I have to admit that I was a bit of a skeptic.In today's society, Saturday and Sunday morning children shows are a rarity, even during the afternoons, you can't find anything.  Today's children to young adult series have been replaced by real characters and if there was any form of puppetry, it has long since disappeared from television and video games and the Internet have now become sources for children's entertainment.""The Muppets"" have become nothing more but a memory for those of us who were able to watch the series while younger.  So, I had no idea what I would think about the film.  Especially having seen a variety of shows that I grew up with such as ""The Transformers"", ""G.I. Joe"", ""The Smurfs"" all receiving movie adaptations, ""The Muppets""...how can they attract today's audience?So, I watched this film with my nine-year-old son.  His familiarity with Kermit the Frog would probably be from our Christmas ritual of watching ""Emmet Otter's Jugband Christmas"" (and due to licensing, Kermit the Frog has since been removed from later DVD releases) but together we watched and I was touched by the storyline of Walter.The character represents the child inside many of us who grew up and was captivated by these characters, but unlike Walter, I stopped watching the series and for the last 20-years, I forgot about them.So, I was touched by seeing the character of Walter wanting to reunite the Muppets but also captivated once again by the camaraderie and the music.  From the opening song of ""The Muppet Theme"" and even hearing ""Rainbow Connection"", I had nothing but a smile on my face because it was like returning to the days of my youth.  I admit, I probably laughed much more than my child because of my familiarity with the characters but we both enjoyed this film immensely and the additional cameos also added to the excitement.Also, Jason Segel and Amy Adams brought a warmth to this film that was enjoyable, humorous and so much fun!  Sure, the musical segments may seem corny to some, but in the sense of how things relate to ""The Muppets"" and the quirkiness and craziness of the show, the musical numbers were perfect.  In fact, I have to say that I really enjoyed the music and the overall soundtrack.  For me, having grown up with the film, just to hear ""Rainbow Connection"" was quite sentimental as I have not heard Kermit the Frog sing that song since I was a child.Also, another positive that I found with this film is that it's a childrens film that doesn't have to utilize the latest in technology.In this day and age of CG graphics and technology, despite the characters being puppets, each character still retains their personality and watching them today, it still hasn't grown old to me.  I've read that Pixar helped out in the storyline department, and if that is indeed the case, you do get some of that Pixar-style sentimental scenes included in the film.  From brotherly relationships, dysfunctional relationships and of course, those who may have wondered what happened between Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy is featured in this film.And while Jim Henson is no longer with us, nor is Frank Oz involved in voicing the characters any longer,  it does help that the voices today don't sound too different from the original voices.  Eric Jacobson, David Goelz, Bill Barretta, David Rudman and Matt Vogel do a wonderful job with the voice acting for this film.But everything came together for this film, a script that touches upon nostalgia but also an appealing, captivating story for the young and old and a wonderful film that will entertain the multiple generations who experienced ""The Muppets"" on television and film.As for this Blu-ray release of ""The Muppets: The Wocka Wocka Value Pack"", you get a Blu-ray, DVD, Digital Copy plus a downloadable soundtrack.  But for Blu-ray enthusiasts, this film looks absolutely fantastic in HD, and the immersive lossless audio soundtrack is equally impressive.  This is a magnificent Blu-ray release if you are fans of ""The Muppets"".Overall, ""The  Muppets"" is a film that I enjoyed a lot.  For so long my friends have told me to watch it, but part of me rolled my eyes and felt, it was a part of my life a long time ago and I don't know if I can get into talking puppets ever again.  I was wrong.I watched this film with my son and we both enjoyed it a lot.  For him, it was because of its crazy characters, the crazy antics and storyline.  For me, deep inside...I was happy because I can easily remember those times of watching ""The Muppets"" everyday and it was one thing for me to enjoy this as a child, but now to enjoy it as a father with my children and knowing friends who are also sharing it with their children or grandchildren makes me happy, because it's one thing from our past that a newer generation of fans can enjoy.""The Muppets"" was definitely a crazy, entertaining and fun film.  The musical elements, the characters and the overall storyline worked perfectly.  Was there anything I didn't like?  Not really, but aside from the quacking chickens to the music of Cee Lo Green's ""Forget You"", I felt the film was entertaining and fun!  Granted, It all depends on one's appreciation for ""The Muppets"", otherwise if you never liked them to begin with, not sure if that's going to change your opinion today.While I don't know what will happen to ""The Muppets"" from here on in, I will say that the James Bobin, Jason Segel and Nicholas Stoller got this film right.  Looking back at the past Muppets films, a lot of them were kitsch and really going downhill.  Because the familiarity of the Muppets are primarily with its older viewers, Segel and Stoller realize that, as they are fans themselves and wanted a film that can appeal to both young and old, like Pixar films.  And they succeeded.So for those who are wondering about this film, what I can tell you is that ""The Muppets"" is a fantastic family film that the younger generation and the older fans can really appreciate. And with this awesome Blu-ray release with wonderful PQ, AQ which is bundled with plenty of enjoyable special features (plus the Blu-ray, DVD and digital copy) plus an entertaining soundtrack, makes the ""The Muppets: The Wocka Wocka Value Pack"" release worth owning.""The Muppets: The Wocka Wocka Value Pack"" is highly recommended!",5,"(4.5 stars) ""The Muppets: The Wocka Wocka Value Pack"" is a

I'm not often one for musicals, but this one - aided by the brilliant combination of fuzzy puppet singers and Flight of the Conchords composition - hits all the right notes.

Loaded with unexpected cameos and sly winks at the troupe's long history, it's clear that a lot of love went into the making of this picture; the screen positively resonates from beginning to end.

1402604,AISYM33PLBYLX,B004EPZ03O,"D. Surine ""Stanley""","[1, 2]","My two favorite Muppet movies are ""The Muppet Movie"" and ""The Great Muppet Caper,"" 2 of the 4 full length movies Jim Henson made while he was alive.  Since then, there have been many short videos and made-for-TV movies that just haven't measured up.  Thankfully, Jason Segel decided he was going to take on the challenge of writing another great movie for the Muppets.  What we end up with is classic Muppet magic.Muppet movies tend to fit into the stereotypical sappy feel-good movie format.  ""The Muppets,"" rather than trying to ignore that fact, decides to embrace it and that becomes a running joke throughout the film.  So instead of having a diabolical laugh, the character actually says, ""Diabolical laugh.""  After the happy ending, everything wraps up and the villian has a change of heart, all during the closing credits.If you're a fan of the Muppets from ""the good old days,"" you'll find that pretty much all of them make an appearance, but we are still introduced to a new Muppet, Walter, who becomes our main character.  And, just like the classic movies, this film would be considered a musical, and we have a GREAT soundtrack.Although, the movie is not flawless.  Even though this is a children's movie, I feel the story was a little rushed and could have easily been another 15-20 minutes.  Because of this, there were some aspects of the story that weren't fully explained in the interest of time.  The most notable being the relationship between Piggy and Kermit.  Though you could make the arguement that since this isn't the point of the film, it's not as important.These few weak points are still not enough to take away a star.  The movie was funny, entertaining, and fit very well into the classic Muppet style.  Muppet fans, young and old, will love this movie.",5,"Thank you, Jason Segel",1331683200,"03 14, 2012",2012,1785,"['two', 'favorite', 'Muppet', 'movies', 'are', 'Muppet', 'Movie', 'Great', 'Muppet', 'Caper', '2', '4', 'full', 'length', 'movies', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'made', 'was', 'alive', 'then', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'short', 'videos', 'made-for-TV', 'movies', 'just', 'have', ""n't"", 'measured', 'up', 'Thankfully', 'Jason', 'Segel', 'decided', 'was', 'going', 'take', 'challenge', 'writing', 'great', 'movie', 'Muppets', 'What', 'end', 'up', 'classic', 'Muppet', 'magic.Muppet', 'movies', 'tend', 'fit', 'stereotypical', 'sappy', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'format', 'Muppets', 'rather', 'trying', 'ignore', 'fact', 'embrace', 'running', 'joke', 'film', 'So', 'instead', 'having', 'diabolical', 'laugh', 'character', 'actually', 'Diabolical', 'laugh', 'happy', 'ending', 'everything', 'wraps', 'up', 'villian', 'change', 'heart', 'closing', 'credits.If', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Muppets', 'good', 'old', 'days', ""'ll"", 'find', 'pretty', 'much', 'make', 'appearance', 'are', 'still', 'introduced', 'new', 'Muppet', 'Walter', 'who', 'main', 'character', 'just', 'classic', 'movies', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'considered', 'musical', 'have', 'GREAT', 'soundtrack.Although', 'movie', 'not', 'flawless', 'Even', 'children', 'movie', 'feel', 'story', 'was', 'little', 'rushed', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', '15-20', 'minutes', 'were', 'aspects', 'story', 'were', ""n't"", 'fully', 'explained', 'interest', 'time', 'most', 'notable', 'being', 'relationship', 'Piggy', 'Kermit', 'could', 'make', 'arguement', ""n't"", 'point', 'film', 'not', 'important.These', 'few', 'weak', 'points', 'are', 'still', 'not', 'enough', 'take', 'away', 'star', 'movie', 'was', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'fit', 'very', 'well', 'classic', 'Muppet', 'style', 'Muppet', 'fans', 'young', 'old', 'will', 'love', 'movie']",The Muppets
1402605,A3DBUN9EMFMUV1,B004EPZ03O,"Elias B. ""The Atlanta Fried Critic""","[4, 7]","It takes a special movie to make me get fired up, to make me cry, to make me laugh, and to make me feel genuinely happy. It takes an even more special movie to be absolutely perfect, from top to bottom, in terms of acting, direction, effects, sounds, and music. A movie like this doesn't come along all that often, and when it does, I shout it's praise from the rooftops. And I cannot think of a more perfect movie to shout praise towards than Walt Disney Picture's The Muppets, which is undoubtedly the best film I've seen all year.This loving revitalization of Jim Henson's legendary creations kicks off with Gary (Jason Segal, who puts on his best good-boy act here) and his younger brother Walter (a Muppet), who have both been lifelong fans of The Muppet Show. Along with Gary's girlfriend of ten years, Mary (a charming Amy Adams), they travel to California to see just where the Muppets have been since the cancellation of the show. The answer isn't pretty. Kermit is a reclusive shut-in, living in a house built for him and Miss Piggy, who has now given up her beloved frog for a fashion magazine in France. Fozzy is cracking bad jokes at a sadsack casino with a Muppets cover group, Animal has attended anger therapy classes, and Gonzo runs a plumbing business. But the whole gang has to be brought back together for one last show in order to save the Muppet Theater, which is about to be torn down and tapped for oil by tycoon Tex Richman (Chris Cooper at his menacing best.)The Muppets would have been an easy movie to turn into a tongue-and-cheek parody of the source material, like 2009's Land of the Lost. James Bobin, of Da Ali G Show and Flight of the Conchords fame, could have easily pulled off putting sexual themes in different shots. Jason Segal and Nicholas Stoller, who have teamed up for R-rated comedies like Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Get Him to the Greek, could have put in subtle pot jokes to elicit laughs from people old enough to get them.However, they didn't. What they did do was make a pure, light-hearted movie that captures everything you've ever loved about Jim Henson's creations, and amplifies it to the umpteenth degree. They've taken the characters we've grown up with and made them more modern, with added layers of pathos that make you genuinely feel for them. Kermit and Piggy's on-again, off-again relationship no longer feels like a running gag, but comes across a genuinely real affair. Hell, even Animal's love of drumming comes across as a primordial desire that he's destined to fulfill. I never thought I'd be saying this, but the Muppets feel like real people.That's especially true for newcomer Walter, who idolizes the Muppets for the way they make him feel empowered and normal. The story between him and Gary is perhaps the crowning achievement of the movie, as he learns to stake out his independence and uncover talents he never knew he had. Jason Segal reacts remarkably well for somebody acting side-by-side with a puppet, conveying a true sense of brotherhood with Walter. That sibling bond is one of the movie's driving strengths.Another strength is just how damned innocent the whole affair is. As I mentioned, this isn't a ""modern reboot"" of the Muppets. It's a Muppet movie made with modern technology and actors, still holding onto the same sensibilities that were on display back in 1979's The Muppet Movie. You've got your music numbers, which are very infectious and will surely be lodged in your skull for weeks. You've got your good-natured humor, which is easily grasped by children and still uproariously funny to adults. But most importantly, you've got your strong moral when all's said and done.Most movie morals are pretty simple, but special attention should be drawn The Muppets' excellent message to kids and adults at the end. That message, without spoiling too much, is that there is honor in losing. As long as you're willing to pick everything back up again and stick by your family and friends, you have a fighting chance, no matter how hard you're kicked down. And even if you don't win, you've at least got people who'll stay by you until the very end. That type of moral has been seen in movies like Remember the Titans and Friday Night Lights, but rarely in a film with puppets geared towards kids.And it's a moral that applies to The Muppets as well. Opening the same weekend as the utterly dreadful, but sadly bankable Breaking Dawn Part One, Jason Segal's love letter to his childhood may not come in first this winter. But it's put up a better fight than any film I've seen in a while, and shown such effort at crafting a purely entertaining and heartwarming experience that I can't find fault in it. Out of everything I've watched in theaters this year, this has been the only movie to make me walk out feeling completely fulfilled. It is utter perfection, one of the best films I've seen to date.And with that being said, then it should be entirely clear that The Muppets is the best movie I've seen this year. Run, don't walk, to your local theater and shell out the money for this charming, heartwarming, and hilarious landmark.Grade: A+(note: This review originally appeared on my Tumblr blog, Dem

The film sets up a clever way to get the Muppets back together, both acknowledging their long absence and making a story out of it. The villains and story seem like they could have come out of the 1980s classics. Best of all, we get some of the Muppets' classic humor, including breaking the 4th wall. If I had one disappointment, it was with the human actors. Jason Segal is relatively new, but Amy Adams I'd always loved for her unbridled energy and enthusiasm. However, they're mostly used in the song and dance numbers. In fact, I think the movie tried to do too much by forcing their love drama into the movie along with all of the other plot elements.

1402613,A3OZ7RXT1XGZR9,B004EPZ03O,freeismylife,"[40, 52]","On Saturday (11/19), my son and I attended an advance screening of the new movie ""The Muppets"".  From the moment I received the invitation, I started going back in time to when my entire family would gather in the family room to watch The Muppets on TV.I remember the show format being similar to ""Laugh In"" and 'Sonny and Cher"" (if you are old enough to remember back that far).  I was in love with Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog and Fozzie's silly jokes cracked me up. Everyone was rooting for Gonzo to finally do one of his hair brained stunts right and the dancing chickens were the hit of the evening. And each show was always hosted by one of the biggest stars in Hollywood. When I told my son that I was a few years older that he is now when the show first came on TV, he said ""Dang! The Muppets are that old?"" Don't you just love kids...The movie ""The Muppets"" starts out back in the day when the TV show was still a major hit. A little boy (well, more puppet than boy) named Walter who doesn't fit in with the rest of the kids in the neighborhood discovers The Muppets Show on TV and lives and breathes everything Muppets related all the way into adulthood. His brother Gary (played by Jason Segel) it very protective of Walter, much to the chagrin of his very, very long time girlfriend Mary (played by Amy Adams). What was suppose to be romantic getaway to LA for Mary and Gary, turns into a trip to the old Muppets studios by the threesome.The Muppet Theater is now in major disrepair because the gang has all gone their separate ways.  Kermit is in seclusion. Miss Piggy is now a Vogue editor in Paris. Fonzie Bear is living foul doing bad theater in Reno and Animal is in a mental institution with actor Jack Black. When a evil oilman plans to take over the Muppet Studios and tear it down, Gary talks the Muppet gang into getting back together to raise enough money to save the studio from ruin.The movie is a totally cute vehicle for introducing a new audience to The Muppets while also taking the people who grew up watching the show in the 1970's back down memory lane.  My son thought all the silly gags and fart jokes were great and I was singing The Muppets song and totally enjoying getting re-acquitted with all the characters from my youth.My favorite character is still Miss Piggy and she was adorable with all her clothing and hair changes throughout the movie. My son was rolling when Miss Piggy started karate chopping everyone. And when Kermit started singing ""The Rainbow Connection"" I was singing right along with him.Just like in the original series, his movie had cameo appearances from major Hollywood stars like Mickey Rooney, Alan Arkin, Selena Gomez, Whoopi Goldberg, and Neil Patrick Harris.If you were not a Muppets fan before, you will be after seeing this cute movie.  And don't say I did not warn you when you start singing ""The Rainbow Connection"" and ""Mahna Mahna"" on your way home :)""The Muppets"" opens in theaters Wednesday November 23, 2011 and is rated PG due to signature Muppets fantasy violence.",4,It took me down memory lane...,1321920000,"11 22, 2011",2011,3046,"['Saturday', '11/19', 'son', 'attended', 'advance', 'screening', 'new', 'movie', 'Muppets', 'moment', 'received', 'invitation', 'started', 'going', 'back', 'time', 'when', 'entire', 'family', 'would', 'gather', 'family', 'room', 'watch', 'Muppets', 'TV.I', 'remember', 'show', 'being', 'similar', 'Laugh', ""'Sonny"", 'Cher', 'are', 'old', 'enough', 'remember', 'back', 'far', 'was', 'love', 'Miss', 'Piggy', 'Kermit', 'Frog', 'Fozzie', 'silly', 'jokes', 'cracked', 'up', 'Everyone', 'was', 'rooting', 'Gonzo', 'finally', 'do', 'one', 'hair', 'brained', 'stunts', 'right', 'dancing', 'chickens', 'were', 'hit', 'evening', 'show', 'was', 'always', 'hosted', 'one', 'biggest', 'stars', 'Hollywood', 'When', 'told', 'son', 'was', 'few', 'years', 'older', 'now', 'when', 'show', 'first', 'came', 'TV', 'said', 'Dang', 'Muppets', 'are', 'old', 'Do', ""n't"", 'just', 'love', 'kids', 'movie', 'Muppets', 'out', 'back', 'day', 'when', 'TV', 'show', 'was', 'still', 'major', 'hit', 'little', 'boy', 'well', 'more', 'puppet', 'boy', 'named', 'Walter', 'who', ""n't"", 'fit', 'rest', 'kids', 'neighborhood', 'Muppets', 'Show', 'TV', 'lives', 'breathes', 'everything', 'Muppets', 'related', 'way', 'adulthood', 'brother', 'Gary', 'played', 'Jason', 'Segel', 'very', 'protective', 'Walter', 'much', 'chagrin', 'very', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'girlfriend', 'Mary', 'played', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'What', 'was', 'suppose', 'be', 'romantic', 'getaway', 'LA', 'Mary', 'Gary', 'trip', 'old', 'Muppets', 'studios', 'threesome.The', 'Muppet', 'Theater', 'now', 'major', 'disrepair', 'gang', 'gone', 'separate', 'ways', 'Kermit', 'seclusion', 'Miss', 'Piggy', 'now', 'Vogue', 'editor', 'Paris', 'Fonzie', 'Bear', 'living', 'foul', 'doing', 'bad', 'theater', 'Reno', 'Animal', 'mental', 'institution', 'actor', 'Jack', 'Black', 'When', 'evil', 'oilman', 'take', 'over', 'Muppet', 'Studios', 'tear', 'down', 'Gary', 'Muppet', 'gang', 'getting', 'back', 'together', 'raise', 'enough', 'money', 'save', 'studio', 'ruin.The', 'movie', 'totally', 'cute', 'vehicle', 'introducing', 'new', 'audience', 'Muppets', 'also', 'taking', 'people', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'show', '1970', 'back', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'My', 'son', 'thought', 'silly', 'gags', 'fart', 'jokes', 'were', 'great', 'was', 'singing', 'Muppets', 'song', 'totally', 'enjoying', 'getting', 're-acquitted', 'characters', 'youth.My', 'favorite', 'character', 'still', 'Miss', 'Piggy', 'was', 'adorable', 'clothing', 'hair', 'changes', 'movie', 'son', 'was', 'rolling', 'when', 'Miss', 'Piggy', 'started', 'karate', 'chopping', 'everyone', 'when', 'Kermit', 'started', 'singing', 'Rainbow', 'Connection', 'was', 'singing', 'right', 'him.Just', 'original', 'series', 'movie', 'had', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'major', 'Hollywood', 'stars', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'Selena', 'Gomez', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'Neil', 'Patrick', 'Harris.If', 'were', 'not', 'Muppets', 'fan', 'will', 'be', 'seeing', 'cute', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'did', 'not', 'warn', 'when', 'start', 'singing', 'Rainbow', 'Connection', 'Mahna', 'Mahna', 'way', 'home', 'Muppets', 'theaters', 'Wednesday', 'November', '23', '2011', 'rated', 'PG', 'due', 'signature', 'Muppets', 'fantasy', 'violence']",The Muppets

I was really pleased with this movie, and how it tastefully breathes new life into the old franchise. I was particularly pleased to see that this was not a ""reboot""- which is by far the easiest and most popular mannner by which old series are revisited. Rather, ""The Muppets"" continues the long running story, with all the characters having left the theater decades ago, now pursuing their own, weird lives in different parts of the country.Most important of all, this movie successfully captures the laugh-out-loud good times for which the Muppets became famous. It starts out a little slow, but before long, I was clutching my sides with laughter as the movie delved into the bizarre with things such as the ""eighties robot"" and Tex Richman's elaborate way of declining business propositions (which includes a rap song and dancers busting out of his office closet). Jason Seagall and Amy Adams keep things ""human""  and heartfelt, propelling the movie along with their delightful song and dance numbers, such as the hilarious ""Me Party"".

1402615,A2UBSGFCP2QFNV,B004EPZ03O,"Greg Ehrbar ""'MouseTracksOnline'""","[3, 3]","Last year, three major films paid tribute to beloved genres, all largely delighting their proponents and enlisting new audiences as to why they were great in the first place. One is the Oscar-winning Best Picture, ""The Artist,"" capturing Hollywood's golden age with no cynicism or irony, as seen through the eyes of young French filmmakers discovering the joys of classic moviedom; another is ""Hugo,"" an impassioned gateway to a master of celluloid magic, this time drawing the uninitiated into not-to-be-forgotten wonders through his discovery by young people.The third is ""The Muppets,"" the first Muppet project to fire on nearly every cylinder and recapturing the shameless lunacy of Jim Henson's iconic variety show-- once the most popular TV show in the world. Other attempts to bring back their spark have had their moments and should not be dismissed (believe it or not, one project that best captured it in recent years was ""Elmo's Christmas Countdown"" with Ben Stiller, which was as much in the spirit of ""The Muppet Show"" as ""Sesame Street."")It took superfan Jason Segel's A-list clout to get the movie greenlit and Flight of the Conchords director James Bobin's encyclopediac passion for ""The Muppet Show"" to make it work. And in the tradition of the self-reflexive, we-know-we're-in-a-movie tradition of the Muppets, the plot is a surprisingly direct address at whether anybody still cares about Kermit, Miss Piggy and the gang.Even Disney, who owns the franchise and released the movie, isn't spared if you know the history: the villain's claim that he owns the names of our friends and they have no rights to them anymore is reminiscent of the attitude attributed to a Disney regime of the past. (But of course, in the words of Basil Fawlty, ""We're all friends now!"")Bobin was an inspired selection as director. Though ""Flight of the Conchords"" may not seem, at first, to be a cousin in comedy to The Muppet Show (and it's certainly not for children), but the wide-eyed naivete, the shameless absurdity and the earnestness of its main characters is very much in the same vein. ""Conchords"" star Bret McKenzie's Muppet songs are very much like sanitized versions of his comic tunes for the ""Conchords"" BBC Radio series and HBO TV show.McKenzie's ""Man or Muppet"" has made history as the first Oscar winner for the Muppets. Not ""Rainbow Connection"" nor ""The First Time it Happens"" won their statuettes -- there hasn't even been a special Oscar for Jim Henson. The song is funny and memorable but I really like ""Life's a Happy Song"" and Amy Adams' ""Party of One.""Speaking of the radiant Ms. Adams, she has little to do in the film (as is the tradition in Muppet productions, after all) but she makes every moment shine. I can't help draw a parallel, this time to another loving tribute film in which she starred -- ""Enchanted"" -- which has a lot of similarities in tone and sincerity to The Muppets.The DVD/Blu-ray/movie & music download package, aka the ""Wocka Wocka"" edition, certainly offers a lot for the money. Once again, DVD owners will not get every feature as Blu-ray owners, which still seems not nice.One thing DVD owners do not get, besides a nicer-looking picture,is the entertaining audio commentary (thank you!) with Segel, Bobin and co-writer Nick Stoller. Segel constantly ribs the Disney folks in the studio with them by relentlessly cross-promoting in classic Disney synergy fashion, as well as remind us of almost every film in Adams' resume.One interesting Blu-ray feature is also quite curious: whenever the disc is paused, an ""intermission"" sequence pops on. Each time, it rests on a different point in a series of connecting gags. It's a nice idea-- but it also prevents the viewer from freezing a frame to catch a quick Muppety gag in the background (a funny sign, inside joke, etc.) So ironically, the DVD owner can freeze frames while the Blu-ray watcher cannot.Wocka wocka, indeed!",5,ONE OF 2011'S BIGGEST & BEST BIG-SCREEN TRIBUTES,1333152000,"03 31, 2012",2012,3918,"['Last', 'year', 'three', 'major', 'films', 'paid', 'tribute', 'beloved', 'genres', 'largely', 'delighting', 'proponents', 'enlisting', 'new', 'audiences', 'why', 'were', 'great', 'first', 'place', 'One', 'Oscar-winning', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Artist', 'capturing', 'Hollywood', 'golden', 'age', 'cynicism', 'irony', 'seen', 'eyes', 'young', 'French', 'filmmakers', 'discovering', 'joys', 'classic', 'moviedom', 'Hugo', 'impassioned', 'gateway', 'master', 'celluloid', 'magic', 'time', 'drawing', 'uninitiated', 'not-to-be-forgotten', 'wonders', 'discovery', 'young', 'people.The', 'third', 'Muppets', 'first', 'Muppet', 'project', 'fire', 'nearly', 'cylinder', 'recapturing', 'shameless', 'lunacy', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'iconic', 'variety', 'show', 'once', 'most', 'popular', 'TV', 'show', 'world', 'Other', 'attempts', 'bring', 'back', 'spark', 'have', 'had', 'moments', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'dismissed', 'believe', 'not', 'one', 'project', 'best', 'captured', 'recent', 'years', 'was', 'Elmo', 'Christmas', 'Countdown', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'was', 'much', 'spirit', 'Muppet', 'Show', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'took', 'superfan', 'Jason', 'Segel', 'A-list', 'clout', 'get', 'movie', 'greenlit', 'Flight', 'Conchords', 'director', 'James', 'Bobin', 'encyclopediac', 'passion', 'Muppet', 'Show', 'make', 'work', 'tradition', 'self-reflexive', ""we-know-we're-in-a-movie"", 'tradition', 'Muppets', 'plot', 'surprisingly', 'direct', 'address', 'anybody', 'still', 'Kermit', 'Miss', 'Piggy', 'gang.Even', 'Disney', 'who', 'franchise', 'released', 'movie', ""n't"", 'spared', 'know', 'history', 'villain', 'claim', 'names', 'friends', 'have', 'rights', 'anymore', 'reminiscent', 'attitude', 'attributed', 'Disney', 'regime', 'past', 'course', 'words', 'Basil', 'Fawlty', ""'re"", 'friends', 'now', 'Bobin', 'was', 'inspired', 'selection', 'director', 'Flight', 'Conchords', 'may', 'not', 'seem', 'first', 'be', 'cousin', 'comedy', 'Muppet', 'Show', 'certainly', 'not', 'children', 'wide-eyed', 'naivete', 'shameless', 'absurdity', 'earnestness', 'main', 'characters', 'very', 'much', 'same', 'vein', 'Conchords', 'star', 'Bret', 'McKenzie', 'Muppet', 'songs', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'sanitized', 'versions', 'comic', 'tunes', 'Conchords', 'BBC', 'Radio', 'series', 'HBO', 'TV', 'show.McKenzie', 'Man', 'Muppet', 'made', 'history', 'first', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Muppets', 'Not', 'Rainbow', 'Connection', 'First', 'Time', 'won', 'statuettes', 'there', ""n't"", 'even', 'been', 'special', 'Oscar', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'song', 'funny', 'memorable', 'really', 'Life', 'Happy', 'Song', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'Party', 'One', 'Speaking', 'radiant', 'Ms.', 'Adams', 'little', 'do', 'film', 'tradition', 'Muppet', 'productions', 'moment', 'shine', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'draw', 'parallel', 'time', 'loving', 'tribute', 'film', 'starred', 'Enchanted', 'lot', 'similarities', 'tone', 'sincerity', 'Muppets.The', 'DVD/Blu-ray/movie', 'music', 'download', 'package', 'Wocka', 'Wocka', 'edition', 'certainly', 'lot', 'money', 'Once', 'again', 'DVD', 'owners', 'will', 'not', 'get', 'feature', 'Blu-ray', 'owners', 'still', 'not', 'nice.One', 'thing', 'DVD', 'owners', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'nicer-looking', 'picture', 'entertaining', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Segel', 'Bobin', 'co-writer', 'Nick', 'Stoller', 'Segel', 'constantly', 'Disney', 'folks', 'studio', 'relentlessly', 'cross-promoting', 'classic', 'Disney', 'synergy', 'fashion', 'as', 'well', 'remind', 'almost', 'film', 'Adams', 'resume.One', 'interesting', 'Blu-ray', 'feature', 'also', 'quite', 'curious', 'whenever', 'disc', 'paused', 'intermission', 'sequence', 'pops', 'time', 'different', 'point', 'series', 'connecting', 'gags', 'nice', 'idea', 'also', 'viewer', 'freezing', 'frame', 'catch', 'quick', 'Muppety', 'gag', 'background', 'funny', 'sign', 'joke', 'etc', 'So', 'ironically', 'DVD', 'owner', 'can', 'freeze', 'frames', 'Blu-ray', 'watcher', 'can', 'not', '.Wocka', 'wocka', 'indeed']",The Muppets

1402617,A13O1YCZCYT76I,B004EPZ03O,Greg,"[8, 21]","...because that's the bulk of what this movie has to offer.The Muppets (2011) is a true Meta-movie; a movie about reviving the Muppets that was, itself, an attempt to breathe life back into those old fabric characters.  It holds a lot of promise - Jason Segel is a talented and funny writer, Amy Adams has been really succesfull in this type of 'fun for the whole family' movie. In fact, the whole project feels like it was brought up with a lot of love and devotion, as apposed tomany,many,manyother nostalgia exploiting endeavors over the past decade that feel more like they've been cooked up in cold, unfeeling offices by ad executives and money hungry moguls.  I have to admit, my hopes were high!But the Muppets falls flat.  So flat that I'm a little taken a-back by the overwhelmingly positive reviews.  It's strange to chalk that all up to fond memories of yester-year and an overwhelming hunger to see the Muppets back in their former, razor whitted, unnappologetically insane, glory... but I can't see what else would keep your interest throughout.  It's not a bad movie, not by any means. But I can only see it being a 'great' movie if you really, really want it to be.It's hard to point the finger at any specific problem... Oh, wait, no it's not: our three leads - Gary (Segel), Mary (Adams) and Walter, Gary's twin (?) brother who's a Muppet... or something.  He's a puppet, but maybe he's not a 'Muppet'?  Something like that.  Point is we spend a lot of time with them - the actual Muppets don't show up for maybe twenty minute, and even then it's just Kermit sounding like he's already taken his Valium for the evening.  We spend so much time following these three around and focusing on their needs (Marriage, identity, family) that it almost stops feeling like a Muppet movie and more like a mediocre kids movie about letting go and growing up.  And the worst part is that these three non-muppet protagonists were ABSOLUTELY NECCESSARY.  We needed SOMETHING to drag the muppets into the 2010's, they couldn't just show up - too much time has passed.  And that something turned out to be mostly uniteresting and unsatisfying.The greatest failing of this new Muppet movie is that it's boring.  There are jokes (some good ones), but they're too far and few between.  The character arcs (there are character acrs: credit where credit is due) are mostly thin and hastily wrapped up in-part because there's so many of them.  The celebrity cameos are neat and sort of a novelty, but mostly brief and rarely funny.  The song and dance numbers involve more humans than Muppets and are a little too silly and kiddish to get involved in.  I was bored frequently, the kids around me in the theatre were noticably (often vocally) bored.  It was kind of a shame...But...What if this is exaclty what this movie NEEDED to be?  What if this is followed by two or three or even four Muppet movies not bogged down by excess exhibition or boring characters?  I should certainly mention and respect the fact that it was no small feet to (almost literally) drag these throwback chacaters of 80's nostalgia into a modern scene.

Since then they have mostly stagnated with straight-to-DVD and TV movies. Someone at Disney reckoned a reboot was in order so now we have the unimaginatively-titled ""The Muppets"". I was surprised to see Jason Segal's name as a writer in the opening credits, and I had hopes that it would feel original and inspired rather than something made by a Disney committee.With the gang disbanded and pursuing their own paths their theatre is at risk of falling into the hands of a greedy oil magnate. A young misfit Muppet decides to get them together and save their legacy. Sound familiar? It's virtually the exact same plot fromIt's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie, by way of many repeated scenes fromthe original Muppet Movie. I have to say I wasn't smitten, despite really wanting to like it. The human interaction with the mop-puppets didn't seem natural (you know what I mean) and felt stilted and difficult. They're just in the background with no decent story.There were too many songs, a couple being completely superfluous. Despite the numerous cameos I just didn't feel that this movie had any star power. I longed for Michael Caine to show up and add some credibility to it. Sadly it was just too TV-ish, with many TV actors filling out the various parts. This ranks somewhere towards the bottom of the Muppets long list of movies, even beneath The Muppets Go Medieval starring Troy McClure.The Blu-ray looks very good in 1.78:1 1080p with Jason Segel's many warts and moles offending my delicate eyes.

1402629,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B004EPZ03O,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[6, 7]","I can remember as a kid watching THE MUPPET SHOW with my family, and we all liked it for various reasons, but no matter the age difference, we all laughed and loved the creations of the dear departed Jim Henson and Frank Oz. During the late 70's and into the early 80's, The Muppets were heavily ingrained in pop culture, with the show and with the feature films THE MUPPET MOVIE, THE GREAT MUPPET CAPER and THE MUPPETS TAKE MANHATTAN, where Oz made his directing debut. But in the years following, something happened. The further away from the lovable characters we were, the less we thought of them. After a few attempts to bring the Muppets to the big screen again after the passing of Jim Henson, with films like A MUPPET CHRISTMAS CAROL and MUPPET TREASURE ISLAND, nothing really became of them. The Muppets went from being universally beloved to ""Out of sight; out of mind"" in just one generation.But leave it to the creative minds of co-writer/co-star Jason Segel, and THE FLIGHT OF THE CONCHORDS Bret McKenzie and director James Bobit to not only reintroduce The Muppets to a whole new generation, but to also remind those of us who had forgotten the great wonder and joy that we experienced watching The Muppets. Like some of the greatest of the Disney/Pixar films, they transplant the ideology of that company which is to always aim for the smartest person in the audience and allow the rest to be taken in by the joy of the spectacle.But in their genius, Bobit, Segel and McKenzie actually engage us with these characters again, but not with a reboot or a reimagining or a sequel. They actually recognize, as does the film itself, that The Muppets haven't been a thing for quite some time, and their efforts to save their studio from demolishing by the diabolical villain of the piece, oil baron Tex Richman (played with tongue firmly planted in cheek by Chris Cooper) are shot down at nearly every turn by television executives who find they can get more mileage out of lowest-denomiator abusive reality TV than a program that is intelligent and charming (the film works on several levels; one of them being biting satire). As a writer, Segel sells his humor well, as well as the director Bobit, who directs the film with great verve and smarts. The songs by McKenzie are outrageous (the Oscar-Winning ""Man or Muppet""), infectious (""Life's a Happy Song""), and surprisingly poignant (""Pictures in My Head""). Also working her many charms here is Amy Adams, the perfect girl-next-door schoolteacher who can also fix a V-12 engine and is Segel's character's girlfriend of 10 years.Also along side the many fuzzy characters (obvious returns by Kermit, Fozzie, Gonzo, Rolf, Animal, Beaker, and the indomitable Miss Piggy among many many others) is the new character of Walter, Segel's younger brother, who, along with Segel, finds his destiny with the help of The Muppets.What could literally be the most telling moment of the whole film is as members of the Muppet cast sing an abridged and incredibly amusing version of Nirvana's eponymous classic, ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" in the presence of an angry Jack Black, calling them out as ruining one of the greatest songs of all time. This would probably be lost on most audience members the first time around, but when I rewatched it again just a few days ago, I saw there was something more going on. The song itself is considered the ultimate song of teen angst and volatile cynicism, but the way that the song is performed is outrageous, filled with lively humor and vacant of the vitriol of the original song. This is essentially the message of the film, and I'm paraphrasing Joss Whedon here: ""The ultimate expression of defiance is joy."" The film basically tells us all to deny what the societal norms are of cynicism, derision and snark and embrace the things that give us the greatest happiness; the things that are free of all of what our culture has become. For this reason above all, THE MUPPETS is a film for the ages, young and old.",5,It's THE MUPPETS!!

1402630,AIO247KHD2O40,B004EPZ03O,James N Simpson,"[0, 0]","I got this DVD purely as I am a fan of Jason Segel, as well as quite a few of the modern TV shows that I knew had actors in cameo roles in this movie. I was a fan of the Muppets as a kid, although the fresh spin off show was Fraggle Rock (there was also a cartoon with the Muppets in diapers), The Muppet Show itself was well and truly into the rerun stage by my childhood, and some of the Muppet characters, especially the band, were sort of like they portray them all in this a film, a bit dated, but I still liked and enjoyed watching The Muppet Show. Plus there was the odd movie out on video or on TV every now and then when I was growing up.So I found this a nice nostalgic trip, where when each different Muppet would appear, I would remember a scene from the TV show or their other movies such as Sweetums picking up and eating a girl with her legs kicking as she went down his mouth. That's a good thing about this movie, there's heaps of characters, so you do get to see them all. However this is also a bad thing as other than Kermit (and Walter the new Muppet of course), in an effort to fit them all into the movie none of the characters really have much air time. I don't remember in any detail but I'm pretty sure the other movies concentrated on say a group of ten Muppets (Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie, Gonzo, Rowlf and Animal plus maybe a couple of others) for most of the plot, with a lot of action and dialogue between the core group, with the other Muppets just having cameos or being in the group scenes. That's not the case here, this film doesn't really have much of a plot at all, it's a just a really basic skeleton plot of a couple taking a holiday to LA, where the girl hopes her ten year relationship boyfriend will finally propose and ultimately spend more time with her and less time with his brother. Unfortunately for her, he has bought an extra bus ticket for Walter, the brother who is obsessed with The Muppets. So of course they have to visit the old studios. By trespassing where he shouldn't be, the brother learns the ownership of the studios is about to be acquired by an evil oil man who wants demolish the place and drill for oil. The Muppets have a couple of days to raise 10 million dollars or ownership goes to him. Problem is the Muppets have all moved on with their lives, no one seems to care but Walter with the help of his brother and brother's girlfriend are determined to make them care and one by one come out of retirement and do a one off show to raise the cash.The overly simple plot and constant introduction of new characters works for an audience who are familiar with all the characters and have memories from their childhood. I don't know though that it has enough substance for a new generation of kids unfamiliar with these particular puppets to get much out of it, or to make them want to know and see more, as a lot of the funny lines are the characters making fun of the past, or the subtle references to the sexual harassment by Miss Piggy on Kermit and things like this which aren't in this film. Incidentally it hasn't been diluted totally from the show that it was on TV by the PC movement. (There's some plot spoilers here if you haven't seen it yet) Piggy does jump another Muppet taking him to the floor in a giant hug to make Kermit uncomfortable and leave her dressing room if he doesn't want to watch them doing that act, when he had gone in there to beg her to move on from their past and perform a duet on stage with him. She also brutally assaults another pig who they have employed to perform her part when she changes her mind and now wants to be a part of the show after the other pig tells Miss Piggy too bad, she's now doing the part. Gonzo also murders all his employees for no apparent reason instead of simply selling the business and negating the whole need for the fund raiser concert.The cameo actors don't for the most part have many if any lines which is a bit disappointing, they are also from mostly adult of TV sitcoms such as Community, Big Bang Theory, Modern Family and How I Met Your Mother so kids of the age the Muppets target market is probably won't be that familiar with them so may get no enjoyment from seeing them on the screen at all simply because they don't know who they are.Jason Segel the main human character (Gary) pretty much plays the same character he does on How I Met Your Mother and every movie he's been in so far throughout his career. Amy Adams (Mary) plays the neglected girlfriend, including performing a few choreographed musical type numbers such as Me Party extremely well. There's a few catchy new songs in this movie such as Life's a Happy Song and Man or Muppet done well by Segel, Adams and the Muppet voice actor singers, as well as few classics from past movies designed to help with the recall of memory flow such as Rainbow Connection.The movie's villain and the other main human actor Tex Richman is a bit tacky and a cliche. There needed to be some sort of motivation besides being an oil man to give his actions in wanting to wipe the Muppets history for the modern day some substance. A childhood flashback where Kermit or some Muppet ran over his dog or something to motivate him down his path of hate. I also found Walter's special talent to be pretty average after it was being built up throughout a large portion of the movie.What was really entertaining is the special feature The Longest Blooper Reel Ever Made, where the Muppets are playing their non character fictional actors stuffing up lines and interacting with each other. I guess I liked this so much because it was so much fresher, original and different to what the movie itself was going for.On its own this movie is unlikely to bring The Muppets a fresh generation of fans who have Shrek, Toy Story and other franchises to compete for their entertainment. In short if you're old enough to have grown up with the Muppets, you'll enjoy this trip down memory lane, although I don't know how many times you'll watch the DVD again in the future, which you may have if it had a plot with a bit more meat to it.",4,"Nice Nostalgic Trip, as Well as Spot the Mostly TV Star Cameos Experience, Don't Know That Would Attract New Generation Though",1344297600,"08 7,

1402632,A27RFBMPCWGZSZ,B004EPZ03O,Jason Waldman,"[8, 11]","As much as I love Jason Segel, I wasn't entirely sure how he would do with ""The Muppets"" given that he usually works in more adult territory.  After seeing the movie in theaters, my apologies to Mr. Segel, because he did an absolutely amazing job bringing ""The Muppets"" back to the big screen!You can tell how much of a labor of love this movie was for Segel.  ""The Muppets"" are treated with a reverance that most ""re-launches"" of franchises don't have.  All of the characters have the same characteristics and features (both physically and emotionally) that they did in the original ""Muppet Show"".  Even the situations that they find themselves in now are believable, from Fozzy performing in Reno to Gonzo owning a plumbing company to Miss Piggy editing a fashion magazine.  Even the minor characters are the same as they once were.The best part about this movie is that the Muppets really are the centerpiece.  While there's the backstory about Segel's ""brother"" (who is a Muppet) and the relationship between Segel and Amy Adams, the focus is on how the Muppets are going to save their theater.  Even with all of the celebrity cameos (and there are a ton), you never get the feeling that Segel wanted to make a blockbuster with an all-star cast.  He knows that the Muppets are big enough stars in their own right.The movie isn't perfect, with Chris Cooper's villain being just a little too over-the-top (the ""maniacal laugh"" joke falls flat the first time out, and doesn't get any funnier the next five) and Segel's brother being just a little too obsessed at times.  But these are all minor flaws in what really is an excellent movie.""The Muppets"" isn't so much a movie as a tribute to a group of characters that we all grew up with.  There's a great feeling of nostalgia throughout the whole movie that adults will appreciate, with more than enough laughs to satisfy young and old alike.  Segel's homage is a very moving tribute to characters he obviously adores and also a nice way to introduce an entire new generation to the magic of the Muppets.",5,Fantastic Homage to the Muppets,1326758400,"01 17, 2012",2012,2055,"['As', 'much', 'love', 'Jason', 'Segel', 'was', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'sure', 'how', 'would', 'do', 'Muppets', 'given', 'usually', 'more', 'adult', 'territory', 'seeing', 'movie', 'theaters', 'apologies', 'Mr.', 'Segel', 'did', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'job', 'bringing', 'Muppets', 'back', 'big', 'screen', 'can', 'tell', 'how', 'much', 'labor', 'love', 'movie', 'was', 'Segel', 'Muppets', 'are', 'treated', 'reverance', 'most', 're-launches', 'franchises', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'characters', 'have', 'same', 'characteristics', 'features', 'physically', 'emotionally', 'did', 'original', 'Muppet', 'Show', 'Even', 'situations', 'find', 'now', 'are', 'believable', 'Fozzy', 'performing', 'Reno', 'Gonzo', 'owning', 'plumbing', 'company', 'Miss', 'Piggy', 'editing', 'fashion', 'magazine', 'Even', 'minor', 'characters', 'are', 'same', 'once', 'were.The', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'Muppets', 'really', 'are', 'centerpiece', 'backstory', 'Segel', 'brother', 'who', 'Muppet', 'relationship', 'Segel', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'focus', 'how', 'Muppets', 'are', 'going', 'save', 'theater', 'Even', 'celebrity', 'cameos', 'are', 'ton', 'never', 'get', 'feeling', 'Segel', 'wanted', 'make', 'blockbuster', 'all-star', 'cast', 'Muppets', 'are', 'big', 'enough', 'stars', 'own', 'right.The', 'movie', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'villain', 'being', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'over-the-top', 'maniacal', 'laugh', 'joke', 'flat', 'first', 'time', 'out', ""n't"", 'get', 'funnier', 'next', 'five', 'Segel', 'brother', 'being', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'obsessed', 'times', 'are', 'minor', 'flaws', 'what', 'really', 'excellent', 'movie', 'Muppets', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'movie', 'tribute', 'group', 'characters', 'grew', 'up', 'great', 'feeling', 'nostalgia', 'whole', 'movie', 'adults', 'will', 'appreciate', 'more', 'enough', 'satisfy', 'young', 'old', 'alike', 'Segel', 'homage', 'very', 'moving', 'tribute', 'characters', 'obviously', 'also', 'nice', 'way', 'introduce', 'entire', 'new', 'generation', 'magic', 'Muppets']",The Muppets

This is a sweet and hilarious film, perhaps the best Muppets effort ever.Now for sure, the absence of Jim Henson and Frank Oz are felt here -- but so are the Muppets!  Wocka wocka!Seriously, though, this movie will be welcome to all the fans of the Muppet TV series and movies, and serve as a superior introduction to a younger generation who may wonder just what magic muppetry can provide in the age of CGI.The jokes here work -- even Fozzy's!  The songs are cute -- and they don't go on too long!  There are many cameos of celebrities both young and old!  (And I'm dating myself when I admit that I didn't have a clue who the young man portraying the human version of Walter the Muppet is -- I didn't recognize his face or his name.  Is this guy a pop star?  A reality TV person?  He looks too slight to be an athlete and too young to be a politician. Ah well...)In addition, the muppetry has never been more seamless -- the Muppet performances and fluid direction combine to make you forget you're looking at marionettes from the git go.Of the human performers on display here, the Muppets deploy a secret weapon -- Amy Adams.  She is simply sensational in her role as the hapless Gary the human's dear and long-suffering fiancee -- and she can also fix a car or an electrical system without breaking a nail!I can't pay Ms. Adams a higher tribute than to say that she more than holds her own sharing a song with Miss Piggy.  Only the most charismatic and adept performers can accomplish that, given the porcine performer's prodigious scene-stealing prowess!And like the very best family movies, this one will bring a tear (or two or three) to the eyes of generations who have grown up with these endearing felt creations.I have deducted one star only because this DVD has only one bonus feature, a ""Blooper Reel"" that runs a scant ten minutes or so.I'm sorry, but there is simply no excuse for the omission of the director's commentary and making-of featurette that appear in the Blu-Ray edition, and the Disney Company seems not to have paid any attention to the movie's essential message: that an attempt to try and do something worthwhile in the company of old and dear friends trumps any venal grab for money or power.So forty lashes with a wet noodle for Disney execs -- and kudos and props and a hearty welcome back for the Frog, Pig, Bear, Daredevil, Drummer, Chickens, Chef, and all their colleagues and collaborators here.",4,Frog and Pig Make Beautiful Music Again...,1334620800,"04 17, 2012",2012,2608,"['was', 'so', 'disappointed', 'Disney', 'recent', 'attempt', 'revive', 'Winnie', 'Pooh', 'franchise', 'had', 'little', 'faith', 'would', 'do', 'better', 'Muppets.Was', 'wrong', 'sweet', 'hilarious', 'film', 'perhaps', 'best', 'Muppets', 'effort', 'ever.Now', 'sure', 'absence', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'Frank', 'Oz', 'are', 'felt', 'here', 'so', 'are', 'Muppets', 'Wocka', 'wocka', 'Seriously', 'though', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'welcome', 'fans', 'Muppet', 'TV', 'series', 'movies', 'serve', 'superior', 'introduction', 'younger', 'generation', 'who', 'may', 'wonder', 'just', 'what', 'magic', 'muppetry', 'can', 'provide', 'age', 'CGI.The', 'jokes', 'here', 'work', 'even', 'Fozzy', 'songs', 'are', 'cute', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'too', 'long', 'are', 'many', 'cameos', 'celebrities', 'young', 'old', ""'m"", 'dating', 'when', 'admit', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'clue', 'who', 'young', 'man', 'portraying', 'human', 'version', 'Walter', 'Muppet', 'did', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'face', 'name', 'guy', 'pop', 'star', 'reality', 'TV', 'person', 'too', 'slight', 'be', 'athlete', 'too', 'young', 'be', 'politician', 'Ah', 'well', 'addition', 'muppetry', 'never', 'been', 'more', 'seamless', 'Muppet', 'performances', 'fluid', 'direction', 'combine', 'make', 'forget', ""'re"", 'looking', 'marionettes', 'git', 'go.Of', 'human', 'performers', 'display', 'here', 'Muppets', 'secret', 'weapon', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'simply', 'sensational', 'role', 'hapless', 'Gary', 'human', 'dear', 'long-suffering', 'fiancee', 'can', 'also', 'fix', 'car', 'electrical', 'system', 'breaking', 'nail', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pay', 'Ms.', 'Adams', 'higher', 'tribute', 'say', 'more', 'own', 'sharing', 'song', 'Miss', 'Piggy', 'Only', 'most', 'charismatic', 'adept', 'performers', 'can', 'accomplish', 'given', 'porcine', 'performer', 'prodigious', 'scene-stealing', 'prowess', 'very', 'best', 'family', 'movies', 'one', 'will', 'bring', 'tear', 'two', 'three', 'eyes', 'generations', 'who', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'endearing', 'felt', 'creations.I', 'have', 'deducted', 'one', 'star', 'only', 'DVD', 'only', 'one', 'bonus', 'feature', 'Blooper', 'Reel', 'scant', 'ten', 'minutes', 'so.I', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'simply', 'excuse', 'omission', 'director', 'commentary', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'appear', 'Blu-Ray', 'edition', 'Disney', 'Company', 'not', 'have', 'paid', 'attention', 'movie', 'essential', 'message', 'attempt', 'try', 'do', 'something', 'worthwhile', 'company', 'old', 'dear', 'friends', 'trumps', 'venal', 'grab', 'money', 'power.So', 'forty', 'lashes', 'wet', 'noodle', 'Disney', 'execs', 'kudos', 'props', 'hearty', 'welcome', 'back', 'Frog', 'Pig', 'Bear', 'Daredevil', 'Drummer', 'Chickens', 'Chef', 'colleagues', 'collaborators', 'here']",The Muppets
1402638,AYUS0J47E85KQ,B004EPZ03O,Jesse Willey,"[10, 13]","When I was really little some of my earliest memories were of my whole family, and sometimes our friends, gathering in front of the TV with some popcorn and Kool Aid to watch The Muppet Show.  I remember being four years old jostling around in the back seat of my dad's Ford Fiesta as he raced us down a bumpy road in order to get us home so we wouldn't miss the opening credits to a TV broadcast of The Muppet Movie.  Unlike the rest of America, we didn't have a VCR in 1984.I remember being at Grandma's and my cousins introducing me to Fraggle Rock which I couldn't see at home because we didn't have cable.  Consequently it is only been in the last year or so that I finally saw that whole series.Most of those  memories of the Muppets involve laughter and surprisingly-- my family.  As we got older, around the time I was eight or so, my sister and I didn't agree on much. She was the one who gave me the news on May 16th 1990. I remember crying until I thought my head would explode.The Muppets films after that- which I didn't like at the time but I found grew on me when I gave them more of a fair shot-- were not quite the same. Okay, not Muppets from Space.  Let's forget that one.  I accepted you could do a good Muppets story without Jim Henson and Frank Oz.  What I worried about was what would the loss of Jerry Juhl mean for the Muppets?I went to The Muppets expecting a middle grade Muppets film that my niece and nephew would probably enjoy more than I would.

The Muppets have to re-unite and put on a telethon show to bring in enough cash to save the theater. However, due to old relationship problems between Kermit and Miss Piggy, bringing Piggy back might be harder than expected and finding a celebrity host for their show is also much harder than Kermit expected.The Muppets marks the return of the beloved puppets that  haven't been on the big screen since the 1999 film, Muppets in Space.

1402651,A1DJMQJ3NY7TV5,B004EPZ03O,Jordan David,"[4, 7]","To be universally acknowledged - let alone renowned - without the weight of cultural boundaries is a feat achieved by few. Really...for all of our cultural phenomenons, how many have been pelted with incessant, albeit perhaps constructive, criticism? Even the immortal Harry Potter, our most recent and prodigious media titan, is not without his own naysayers who hiss of the irresponsibility of praising witchcraft and false magic to our future generations. Come on, I know I wasn't the only one in elementary school.The point is this: Every titan at the cinematic forefront, every defining franchise of every era was not exempt of some subsequent backlash that, however obscure, was favored by the snowball effect as the few discouraged ones finally saw a buoy to keep their vehement objections afloat. It's happened to our young wizards and jedis; our plastic cowboys and lanky Na'Vis. And yet, if there were one crew to stand unstained, simply and quietly smiling until their names were called, it has to be the Muppets.Nearly unmatched in their uncharacteristic nature of being both innocent and daring - clever and humble - these indefinable creatures have printed their legacy with crayons and cursive. Precursors to the Sesame Street monsters, who first appeared amidst a manic and mutating America in 1969, the Muppets first came to fruition in 1955 by the incomparable Jim Henson, who's influence has since then gone on to truly monopolize the operational puppet industry. Seemingly in their prime long after I was born, what greater testament could there be than to have myself acknowledge that I know every name and idiosyncrasy of these puppets with nary a second thought. I needed to process this before writing my review, because it would appear to be almost impossible to speculate as to how someone would respond to a muppet had they never been introduced to one prior.Director Jason Bobin's movie is funny, touching, and wickedly aware of its own long-expired tricks...but is it a piece of good cinematic storytelling? Overall, the answer is yes, although not emphatically. To revel in simplicity is to make complexity an outlier and, for all of its charm, the best example of a joke that caters to an audience above ten boils down to frequent breaks in the fourth wall. It's worthy of a chuckle, and it certainly works towards giving this entire crew credit in understanding that they are dinosaur fossils in a new mammalian culture, but it's never unclear what this is all about and what this is all for: The kids. Take them and show them what they've missed all of these years, because there should never come a time when ""Muppet"" isn't a household name anymore.The movie is a bittersweet recalling of the Muppets' past, with a very slim and, frankly, redundant love story tucked on the underside between Segel and Adams. I've simply come to accept that Adams works exceptionally well in these roles, while Segel's investment in the film itself shows with every earnest dance step. Beyond that...yes, there are cameos and, yes, they are welcome, but the film knows who we love, and they don't disappoint. Kermit and company stand the test of time, even if they likely cannot stand alongside the great pillars which contemporary entertainment has been built upon. And the film makes it clear that they understand and accept this. The Muppets (2011) is not a bolt of electricity intended to rejuvenate the franchise. Rather, it's a heartfelt and honest swan song that echoes good faith to those who have believed in them, and even to those who haven't.There will never be a Gonzo on Cribz; there will never be a Miss Piggy guest appearing alongside Ashton Kutcher and his men. Kermit prefers the cool swamp waters to the limelight of Conan's stage. The Swedish Chef doesn't need Ramsey's tips to be successful.

Kermit is still my hero.  That said, I have been looking forward to seeing this latest Muppet movie.  I really like Amy Adams (she was great in &#34;Enchanted&#34;!)  On the positive side, I liked the story, liked seeing some of the older Muppets, and was glad to see/hear that Steve Whitmire is doing an admirable job (better than initially) as Kermit.  The cameos were fun, and Jack Black was a good choice to be starring with the Muppets.I know that Muppet features are made to appeal to kids and adults, on different levels, which this accomplished, but not to the degree of the Henson era.  Maybe I was comparing this one too much with the original &#34;Muppet Movie,&#34; with its wonderful cameos and puns and special effects.  The only word I can think of to describe this feature is &#34;hokey.&#34;  Yeah; I know it's supposed to be corny, and I expect (and enjoy) the corniness.  And there's probably a fine line between corny and hokey.  In my opinion, this movie crossed the line.  I miss the chemistry of Henson and Oz, and to me, you can definitely sense the difference between the original and current performers.  It was an OK movie to see once, but I probably won't watch it again.

If Henry Ford (that evil guy who made it possible for the non-elite to own automobiles, according to Time Magazine's ""50 Worst Cars of All Time"") could move buildings from all over the world to his museum in Detroit, then ""Tex Richguy"" could probably scoot the little Muppets building a bit to make room for his oil wells, couln't he?  Of course not!  In Hollywood, being from Texas is strike one and making money from burning dinosaurs is strikes two and three.  Why not make the bad guy a developer of those tacky condo complexes that all look the same and have blighted most every once-charming little neighborhood business district in the city where I live?But I digress.  Second, why didn't Rizzo the Rat get a little scene for himself?  I saw rats in the rafters of the old Muppet Theater but I didn't see Rizzo featured in any scene.  What happened?  This is Rizzo who was the lead Muppet for the Muppet Christmas Carol.  (Now there's a classic!)  What if Rizzo had been married for thirty years and had 100 generations of descendants living in that theater, and he got them to clean the place up.  Now that would be funny, and it would not have required so much of the movie's time in the theater-cleaning segment.  Anyone think of that?Nits aside, a beautifully done movie that I'll likely see at least one more time, and hopefully will be accompanied with cool bonus features, like maybe that Toy Story cartoon that was shown before the movie; almost worth the price of admission in and of itself!",5,The theater experience qualifies me to review an unreleased DVD product!,1325548800,"01 3, 2012",2012,2468,"['movie', 'Muppets', 'fans', 'what', 'first', 'Star', 'Trek', 'movie', 'back', '1979', 'did', 'original', 'Trek', 'fans', 'attempted', 'bridge', 'generations', 'giving', 'old', 'Muppets', 'fans', 'nice', 'warm', 'fuzzy', 'blast-from-the-past', 'next', 'generation', 'reason', 'become', 'Muppets', 'fans', 'thought', 'accomplished', 'splendidly', 'was', 'totally', 'entertained', 'movie', 'will', 'likely', 'see', 'again', 'DVD', 'members', 'family', 'who', 'were', 'not', 'movie', 'theater', 'yesterday.Two', 'nit', 'picks', 'First', 'making', 'villians', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'profit', 'traditional', 'sources', 'energy', 'oil', 'sooooo', 'cliche', 'now', 'Believe', 'not', 'being', 'Texas', 'making', 'money', 'finding', 'bringing', 'oil', 'surface', 'not', 'make', 'person', 'just', 'sort', 'who', 'would', 'raze', 'Muppet', 'museum', 'Besides', ""n't"", 'lone', 'oil', 'well', 'still', 'being', 'pumped', 'somewhere', 'middle', 'LA', 'metropolitan', 'area', ""'ve"", 'been', 'seen', ""n't"", 'take', 'up', 'much', 'space', 'Henry', 'Ford', 'guy', 'who', 'made', 'possible', 'non-elite', 'own', 'automobiles', 'according', 'Time', 'Magazine', '50', 'Worst', 'Cars', 'Time', 'could', 'move', 'buildings', 'world', 'museum', 'Detroit', 'then', 'Tex', 'Richguy', 'could', 'probably', 'scoot', 'little', 'Muppets', 'building', 'bit', 'make', 'room', 'oil', 'wells', 'coul', ""n't"", 'course', 'not', 'Hollywood', 'being', 'Texas', 'strike', 'one', 'making', 'money', 'burning', 'dinosaurs', 'strikes', 'two', 'three', 'Why', 'not', 'make', 'bad', 'guy', 'developer', 'tacky', 'condo', 'complexes', 'look', 'same', 'have', 'blighted', 'most', 'once-charming', 'little', 'neighborhood', 'business', 'district', 'city', 'where', 'live', 'digress', 'Second', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'Rizzo', 'Rat', 'get', 'little', 'scene', 'saw', 'rats', 'rafters', 'old', 'Muppet', 'Theater', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'Rizzo', 'featured', 'scene', 'What', 'happened', 'Rizzo', 'who', 'was', 'lead', 'Muppet', 'Muppet', 'Christmas', 'Carol', 'Now', 'classic', 'What', 'Rizzo', 'had', 'been', 'married', 'thirty', 'years', 'had', '100', 'generations', 'descendants', 'living', 'theater', 'got', 'clean', 'place', 'up', 'Now', 'would', 'be', 'funny', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'required', 'so', 'much', 'movie', 'time', 'theater-cleaning', 'segment', 'Anyone', 'think', 'Nits', 'aside', 'beautifully', 'done', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'likely', 'see', 'least', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'hopefully', 'will', 'be', 'accompanied', 'cool', 'bonus', 'features', 'maybe', 'Toy', 'Story', 'cartoon', 'was', 'shown', 'movie', 'almost', 'price', 'admission']",The Muppets
1402667,A2W00XKTTF1G0Z,B004EPZ03O,"Lorenzo M. in the Hollywood CA Area ""Movie Wa...","[5, 8]","MOVIE NOTE #14: THE MUPPETS. Disney and Jim Henson Productions have presented a very timely, heartwarming (in the Muppet way) and very funny film! I have been a Muppet fan for a long time and it's was in 1999's ""Muppets In Space' since we last have seen them on the big screen.Having loved their past features (""A Muppet Christmas Carol' 1992 and the original `The Muppet Movie' 1979 are my favorites) Director James Bobin (BBC TV's own director of `Da Ali G Show' and `Flight of the ConChords') has brought the intelligent adult humor and gags in the way only the Muppets can deliver them! Co-written by it's leading man and Executive Producer Jason Segal (`How I Met Your Mother', `Bad Teacher' and more!) created what a lot of the early expectations of this film were worried about when it was announced  which was will the Muppets work today?Since 1999 the Muppets have only been seen in two TV Movies, `A Ver Mery Muppet Christmas' in 2002  and `The Muppets Wizard f  OZ' in 2005 (also  the last episode of  `The Muppet Show'  (1976-1981) and `Muppets Tonight' (1996-1998)) - there was some speculation whether they could survive their former popularity. Guess what - They do and they did!Jason Segal , an admittingly GINORMOUS Muppet fan - like so many of us - thought he could develop a story that would capture all the magic of the original Muppet timing with the modern day - more intelligent - audiences of today. It basically is the story of two brothers - Garry and Walter. One human (Gary is Jason Segal) one Muppet (Walter is masterfully voiced by Peter Linz who has been a Muppet puppeteer and voice for the franchise since 1999).Gary and Walter are dear brothers and each of them have to deal with where they belong in their respective lives. Gary wants to take his relationship with Mary (hysterically played by Amy Adams - `Enchanted', `Julie & Julia') to the next level - and Walter just wants to visit the Muppet Studios (now deflated and in disrepair) only to discover the Muppet legacy is doomed for destruction by the evil Tex Richman. Tex is played surprisingly convincingly by Chris Cooper (`Jarhead', `Seabiscut' & `American Beauty') who even surprises the audience by Rapping a song. Yes...rapping!Walter, Mary and Gary set out to do the only thing they can - tell Kermit - The Frog. What's going to happen? Kermit is broken hearted in what to do. There is a deadline, obstacles and challenges for the Green Amphibian as he reunites - hysterically - the old gang. Everyone is back with the exception of Miss Piggy. The reason she doesn't want to help become clear...and even understandable. (That's all I'll say about that!)The movie is sprinkled with the perfect amount of song, dance numbers and `Muppetisms' that make the story, fun, adventurous and even heartwarming.The songs are memorable, story driven and in some cases great nods to songs like Academy Award winning ""The Rainbow Connection' from the original film. In fact - that song even peaks its head in this film in a most appropriate way!All the voice talents are brilliantly back!Steve Whitman - (as Kermit / Beaker / Statler / Rizzo / Link Hogthrob / The Newsman)Eric Jacbson - (as Miss Piggy / Fozzie Bear / Animal / Sam Eagle / Marvin Suggs)Dave Goetz  - (as Gonzo / Dr. Bunsen Honeydew / Zoot / Beauregard)Bill Barretta - (as Sweedish Chef / Rowlf / Doctor Teeth / Pepe the Prawn)David Rudman - (as Scooter / Janice / Miss Poogy)Also, as there are in all Muppet movies, tons of cameos including; Adam Arkin, Bill Cobbs, Zach Gaifianakis, Ken Jeong, Sarah Silverman, Emily Blundt, Rashida Jones, James Carville, Whoopi Goldberg, Salena Gomez, David Grohl, Neil Patrick Harris, Judd Hirsch, John Krasinski, Rico Rodriguez, Mickey Rooney and many more! An amazing (and hysterical) surprise was where they cast `The Big Bang Theory's' own Jim Parsons! Wait till you see where he is!I think the late Mr. Jim Hensen would really love this film. If you are a fan of these felt-covered puppets - the movie delivers everything you expect - laughter, fun and warmth that can only be The Muppets. If you are not a fan, you will become one because the humor is intelligent, sarcastic and witty and this will put a smile on every family members face. This is my favorite comedy of the year!

Since then, someone else in my household rented the film on Netflix and so I did get to see it. What a disappointment. The premise that a Muppet character, such as Walter, could be born into a human family is just a bit too hard to swallow. It reminded me of the joke in The Great Muppet Caper in which Kermit and Fozzie are supposed to be brothers - which is helped when you see that their father was a composite of both characters. At least that was plausible in a way this was not. I'm also one of those who find the voices of the characters too different from the old days. Kermit and Piggy are alright and Gonzo is still Gonzo, but Stadler and Waldorf, two of my oldest favorites, just don't sound like themselves anymore. They're supposed to be crotchety old men but they sound like middle-aged goons. I also had trouble believing that Uncle Deadly, villainous though he is, would be willing to even consider selling the Muppet Theatre - he's The Phantom of the Muppet Show, for crying out loud! There, I've done it. Treating Muppets like real people. The truth is that to people like me, they do have a real existence which was part of their charm. At least we got a bit of the real old Muppet Show with the telethon sequence, which was just too short. Though it was a fun idea, I thought it was just too cruel to take Animal's drums away for most of the film.On a final note, one reason I found the voices so jarring was that they were even different from the ones in the recent vignettes to be found on YouTube. Any one of these is more like the classic Muppets than this film. I recommend the Swedish Chef bits ""Popcorn"" and ""Pumpkin Pie"", ""Habanera"" from Carmen, ""Carol of the Bells"" with Beeker, Animal and others, and the fantastic rendering of ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" featuring the original musical track produced by Queen. THIS is what the Muppets are really about.By the way, even though I really don't like the movie, I do like the new character of Walter. He's very much reminiscent of my inner child and after all, he did make a plea for Disney to release the final two seasons of the old Muppet Show.

1402674,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B004EPZ03O,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[8, 11]","""The Muppets"" is a wonderful movie that manages effortlessly to appeal to both the younger adult and mid-life crowd who watched them on TV years ago (and saw their previous films in theaters) as well as young kids who laugh at Fozzie's jokes (sometimes so bad that they're funny anyway) including the one about ""fart shoes."" The plot moves along at a good rate, never too fast or too slow; and the song and dance numbers kept me very entertained. The cameos by Mickey Rooney, Alan Arkin, Zach Galifianakis, Whoopi Goldberg and many more add to the movie's charm and excitement. I also liked the numerous references to days gone by: Kermit has a Rolodex for his contacts and no computer; there's an ""80's"" robot with that awfully annoying screeching ""handshake"" when the modem starts up; and the old posters from the days of ""The Muppet Show"" are great to see in this film, too.When the action starts, we quickly meet two sweethearts Mary (Amy Adams) and Gary (Jason Segel, who also co-wrote the script) as well as Gary's brother Walter (voiced by Peter Linz). Gary is rather close and sometimes too protective of his brother Walter; this sometimes irks Mary because she wants romantic time alone with Gary--not to mention a marriage proposal from him. Walter soon realizes that he has a lot in common with the Muppets--in fact, it turns out that he is actually one of them himself! (That may seem like a spoiler but when you see the film it's immediately obvious as Walter looks very, very much like a Muppet.)When their coveted vacation to Los Angeles finally comes, Gary and Mary take Walter along with them to Los Angeles where Walter wants to tour the Muppet Studios and see everything that has to do with Muppets. Much to Walter's horror, they discover that the old Muppet Studios is barely alive save for a few brief tours by a burnt-out guide (Alan Arkin). Walter steals away to secretly explore Kermit's old office but has to hide under the table when people enter--and that's when Walter discovers that bad guy Tex Richman (Chris Cooper) and his flunkies plan to tear down Muppet Studios to drill for oil and incredible wealth. Walter, with the help of his brother and Mary, must then try to find Kermit or at least one other Muppet to let them know what danger their old studio is in--and what the Muppets must do to save the studio provides the rest of the plot. Needless to say, there's plenty of problems just finding and recruiting the old gang of Muppets; Fozzie is doing a really bad tribute act in Reno with the not so pleasant ""Moopets;"" Miss Piggy is working at a Vogue magazine office in Paris and Rowlf has retired quite happily.Watch ""The Muppets"" for the nostalgia; and let your children experience the wonder of this fine troupe of puppets and actors.

1402675,ATDBWYU6MJNQ3,B004EPZ03O,"M Bardi ""med""","[8, 40]","I was looking forward to the Muppets with much excitement, I was thinking how i used to like the older show from the 70s, and so was eager to watch this new movie with high hopes and big expectations.However, the Muppets really let me down, I was very disappointed with this terrible terrible movie.and where do i start to explain how bad this movie is, and what went wrong !!I guess everything about it was very badly done and poorly executed. there was clearly a lack of imagination and lack of Muppets magic !!Now I know that this movie is a family one, and is mainly aimed at kids and the young ones, however, it doesn't even appeal to kids as well, in fact, my kids lost interest early on and after only a few minutes from starting the movie.So the movie starts with an introduction to a muppet named Walter, who for some unexplained reason is living with  Humans and has a human as brother, Gary played by Jason Segel.Walter is a big fan of the Muppets "" obviously !! "" and never misses a show during the 70s, soon the show stops and the Muppets are no more and are forgotten by the world, so years pass by and we are jumped to our current time, where Walter and Gary are all grown up and are ready to take a trip to Los Angeles to visit the Muppets studios and bring back the Muppets to life !!Jason Segel was just not made for a role like this, he does not have the talent of a dancing and lively performer needed for such a role, and he looked uninterested as ever !! his acting looked so fake and unreal.we are also introduced to Gary's love interest and girlfriend, Mary played by Amy Adams, and here the love story is devoid of any believable emotions and is as boring as ever. I think the character development was poorly done for these two main characters and so no real attachment from the viewers towards them.And while Amy was slightly better than Segel here, she still looked uninterested and her character lacked the charm needed. probably not Amy's fault but rather to the lack of creativity in character development in the script.speaking of characters, almost every Muppet is brought back here, which might be a bad thing, because so much characters were squeezed into the film not allowing enough time for viewers to connect to certain Muppet characters. It was clearly aimed at focusing on Kermit, but even him was rushed into the film quickly without explanation to where he was and why he is living the way he was all alone.the plot was flat and silly, with a mixture of the Muppets reuniting and struggling to get back into show business and having to have to deal with an evil rich businessman who wants to take over the Muppet studios and turn it into some oil producing company or whatever. that villain role went to Chris Cooper, who also seemed out of place here and was one of the worst villains of all time in movie history, a Cliche of a villain with the obvious "" ill get you Muppets "" and "" I will destroy the Muppets "" lines !It was clear that the people behind the movie were concentrating more on which celebrity to bring in as a Cameo rather than focusing on the plot. there were plenty of Cameo appearances including Selena Gomez and Zack Galifiankis which did not add anything special to the film.the worst part of the film, is as i mentioned, the lack on imagination, magic and life in the movie. the dances and songs seemed lifeless and lacking the magic or spirit needed for such movies. it ended up dull and very very boring.sorry to say this, but this gets a fat zero, avoid it !![...]",1,"Very bad movie, lacking in imagination and in Muppets magic",1334966400,"04 21, 2012",2012,3533,"['was', 'looking', 'forward', 'Muppets', 'much', 'excitement', 'was', 'thinking', 'how', 'i', 'used', 'older', 'show', '70s', 'so', 'was', 'eager', 'watch', 'new', 'movie', 'high', 'hopes', 'big', 'expectations.However', 'Muppets', 'really', 'let', 'down', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'terrible', 'terrible', 'movie.and', 'where', 'do', 'i', 'start', 'explain', 'how', 'bad', 'movie', 'went', 'wrong', 'guess', 'everything', 'was', 'very', 'badly', 'done', 'poorly', 'executed', 'was', 'clearly', 'lack', 'imagination', 'lack', 'Muppets', 'magic', 'Now', 'know', 'movie', 'family', 'one', 'mainly', 'aimed', 'kids', 'young', 'ones', 'however', ""n't"", 'even', 'appeal', 'kids', 'as', 'well', 'fact', 'kids', 'lost', 'interest', 'early', 'only', 'few', 'minutes', 'starting', 'movie.So', 'movie', 'introduction', 'muppet', 'named', 'Walter', 'who', 'unexplained', 'reason', 'living', 'Humans', 'human', 'brother', 'Gary', 'played', 'Jason', 'Segel.Walter', 'big', 'fan', 'Muppets', 'obviously', 'never', 'show', '70s', 'soon', 'show', 'Muppets', 'are', 'more', 'are', 'forgotten', 'world', 'years', 'pass', 'are', 'jumped', 'current', 'time', 'where', 'Walter', 'Gary', 'are', 'grown', 'up', 'are', 'ready', 'take', 'trip', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'visit', 'Muppets', 'studios', 'bring', 'back', 'Muppets', 'life', 'Jason', 'Segel', 'was', 'just', 'not', 'made', 'role', 'not', 'have', 'talent', 'dancing', 'lively', 'performer', 'needed', 'such', 'role', 'looked', 'uninterested', 'ever', 'acting', 'looked', 'so', 'fake', 'unreal.we', 'are', 'also', 'introduced', 'Gary', 'love', 'interest', 'girlfriend', 'Mary', 'played', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'here', 'love', 'story', 'devoid', 'believable', 'emotions', 'as', 'boring', 'ever', 'think', 'character', 'development', 'was', 'poorly', 'done', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'so', 'no', 'real', 'attachment', 'viewers', 'towards', 'them.And', 'Amy', 'was', 'slightly', 'better', 'Segel', 'here', 'still', 'looked', 'uninterested', 'character', 'lacked', 'charm', 'needed', 'probably', 'not', 'Amy', 'fault', 'rather', 'lack', 'creativity', 'character', 'development', 'script.speaking', 'characters', 'almost', 'Muppet', 'brought', 'back', 'here', 'might', 'be', 'bad', 'thing', 'so', 'much', 'characters', 'were', 'squeezed', 'film', 'not', 'allowing', 'enough', 'time', 'viewers', 'connect', 'certain', 'Muppet', 'characters', 'was', 'clearly', 'aimed', 'focusing', 'Kermit', 'even', 'was', 'rushed', 'film', 'quickly', 'explanation', 'where', 'was', 'why', 'living', 'way', 'was', 'alone.the', 'plot', 'was', 'flat', 'silly', 'mixture', 'Muppets', 'reuniting', 'struggling', 'get', 'back', 'show', 'business', 'having', 'have', 'deal', 'evil', 'rich', 'businessman', 'who', 'take', 'over', 'Muppet', 'studios', 'turn', 'oil', 'producing', 'company', 'whatever', 'villain', 'role', 'went', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'who', 'also', 'seemed', 'place', 'here', 'was', 'one', 'worst', 'villains', 'time', 'movie', 'history', 'Cliche', 'villain', 'obvious', 'ill', 'get', 'Muppets', 'will', 'destroy', 'Muppets', 'lines', 'was', 'clear', 'people', 'movie', 'were', 'concentrating', 'more', 'celebrity', 'bring', 'Cameo', 'rather', 'focusing', 'plot', 'were', 'plenty', 'Cameo', 'appearances', 'including', 'Selena', 'Gomez', 'Zack', 'Galifiankis', 'did', 'not', 'add', 'anything', 'special', 'film.the', 'worst', 'part', 'film', 'i', 'mentioned', 'lack', 'imagination', 'magic', 'life', 'movie', 'dances', 'songs', 'seemed', 'lifeless', 'lacking', 'magic', 'spirit', 'needed', 'such', 'movies', 'ended', 'up', 'dull', 'very', 'very', 'boring.sorry', 'say', 'fat', 'zero', 'avoid', '[', ']']",The Muppets

1402680,A326BC7L4JGEZ0,B004EPZ03O,"Michael B. Mctighe ""MMcTighe""","[14, 43]","I really like the Muppets. Not only during my childhood but as an adult. Jim Henson's Muppets are very unremarkable puppets, but through his genius he gave them dynamic personalities that contrasted their bland exteriors. If you watch some of the original movies like The Muppet Movie, Muppets Take Manhattan, and Muppets in space you'll notice a subtle brilliance. The Muppets work not only as entertainment, but also as satire of entertainment in general. Specifically as a commentary of what it is really like to work in Hollywood. About the failures, the obstacles and the individuals who just haven't made it yet.This movie has none of this. None of the spirit, the heart and the warmth.When I heard Segal (and Adams) were involved, I was excited. Segal shows a lot of fandom towards the Muppets, but being a fan isn't enough. Much of what pours through in the writing seems like Segal's own private fantasy. Like some wild adventure he would've liked to have had with the Muppets that really has nothing to do with the Muppets. The movie never seems to be about the Muppets, but rather seems like it's about Segal, Adams and his Muppet brother. The three least interesting additions.These problems show up in the musical numbers, which usually drag on far to long, are bland and uninspired, and feature whole chorus lines of dancing humans. Dancing humans? The original Muppet movies typically got by with incidental human interactions. The musical numbers were almost always Muppet driven. Not these. They look like something more appropriate for Hairspray.This is confusing for me. When I started the movie I was offended by the glaring lack of focus on The Muppets. Where is the whirlwind romance between Piggy and Kermit? Where is the Rizzo side story? Where is the hilarious stand up of Fozzy Bear, or for that matter, where is the not-so-hilarious stand up of Fozzy Bear? The Electric Mayhem? I remember laughing in previous Muppet installments, now I sit anxiously waiting for musical numbers to wrap it up.The story is cliche' at best, which isn't even a problem, but becomes one since the movie lacks any heart. The Muppets were never particularly plot driven anyways, but the characters are important, and with their noticeable absence from the plot it's forced to rely on it's weak plot and forced cameos. Cameos used to be reserved, by the by, for real talents who added to the movie's Variety Show feel, but now their just Tween icons who awkwardly try to fit in where they don't belong.This movie, at best, is a passable musical. Sadly The Muppets are a VARIETY show, and it's that variety displayed through unique personalities who all represents various aspects of ""the business"" that made the Muppets so special. Also this movie removed the edge and grit that brought the Muppets so close to home. The overly polished atmosphere of this film gets away from the Indie atmosphere that was always present during the Henson era. The Muppets always felt like a charming low budget variety troupe' on the verge of making it, and when you have a back up crew of 40 dancers you lose that. When you lose that, you really lose the novelty of it all.If there is any consolation in the two star review it's that I believe Segal did his best. I think the nostalgia element is there, and certainly I appreciate that he is a fan, and not some Hollywood Exec just trying to make a buck (how ironic). I think he unwittingly proved that without Henson, or a much stronger understanding of Henson, that any attempt to revive this franchise is probably not worth it. My suspicion always has been that without Henson this franchise is dead, and from the looks of it, it is. He still left us many wonderful hours of the old Muppets on DVD. If I were anyone I would rewatch some old Muppets if they wish to relive the glory. Skip this little number, it ain't worth it.",2,Walka Walka Walka out of the theater,1330300800,"02 27, 2012",2012,3868,"['really', 'Muppets', 'Not', 'only', 'childhood', 'adult', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'Muppets', 'are', 'very', 'unremarkable', 'puppets', 'genius', 'gave', 'dynamic', 'personalities', 'contrasted', 'bland', 'exteriors', 'watch', 'original', 'movies', 'Muppet', 'Movie', 'Muppets', 'Take', 'Manhattan', 'Muppets', 'space', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'subtle', 'brilliance', 'Muppets', 'work', 'not', 'only', 'entertainment', 'also', 'satire', 'entertainment', 'general', 'Specifically', 'commentary', 'what', 'really', 'like', 'work', 'Hollywood', 'failures', 'obstacles', 'individuals', 'who', 'just', 'have', ""n't"", 'made', 'yet.This', 'movie', 'none', 'None', 'spirit', 'heart', 'warmth.When', 'heard', 'Segal', 'Adams', 'were', 'involved', 'was', 'excited', 'Segal', 'lot', 'fandom', 'Muppets', 'being', 'fan', ""n't"", 'enough', 'Much', 'what', 'writing', 'Segal', 'own', 'private', 'fantasy', 'wild', 'adventure', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'have', 'had', 'Muppets', 'really', 'nothing', 'do', 'Muppets', 'movie', 'never', 'be', 'Muppets', 'rather', 'Segal', 'Adams', 'Muppet', 'brother', 'three', 'least', 'interesting', 'additions.These', 'problems', 'show', 'up', 'musical', 'numbers', 'usually', 'drag', 'far', 'long', 'are', 'bland', 'uninspired', 'feature', 'whole', 'chorus', 'lines', 'dancing', 'humans', 'Dancing', 'humans', 'original', 'Muppet', 'movies', 'typically', 'got', 'incidental', 'human', 'interactions', 'musical', 'numbers', 'were', 'almost', 'always', 'Muppet', 'driven', 'Not', 'look', 'something', 'more', 'appropriate', 'Hairspray.This', 'confusing', 'When', 'started', 'movie', 'was', 'offended', 'glaring', 'lack', 'focus', 'Muppets', 'Where', 'whirlwind', 'romance', 'Piggy', 'Kermit', 'Where', 'Rizzo', 'side', 'story', 'Where', 'hilarious', 'stand', 'Fozzy', 'Bear', 'matter', 'where', 'not-so-hilarious', 'stand', 'Fozzy', 'Bear', 'Electric', 'Mayhem', 'remember', 'laughing', 'previous', 'Muppet', 'installments', 'now', 'sit', 'anxiously', 'waiting', 'musical', 'numbers', 'wrap', 'up.The', 'story', 'cliche', 'best', ""n't"", 'even', 'problem', 'one', 'movie', 'heart', 'Muppets', 'were', 'never', 'particularly', 'plot', 'driven', 'anyways', 'characters', 'are', 'important', 'noticeable', 'absence', 'plot', 'forced', 'rely', 'weak', 'plot', 'forced', 'cameos', 'Cameos', 'used', 'be', 'reserved', 'real', 'talents', 'who', 'added', 'movie', 'Variety', 'Show', 'feel', 'now', 'just', 'Tween', 'icons', 'who', 'awkwardly', 'try', 'fit', 'where', 'do', ""n't"", 'belong.This', 'movie', 'best', 'passable', 'musical', 'Sadly', 'Muppets', 'are', 'VARIETY', 'show', 'variety', 'displayed', 'unique', 'personalities', 'who', 'various', 'aspects', 'business', 'made', 'Muppets', 'so', 'special', 'Also', 'movie', 'removed', 'edge', 'grit', 'brought', 'Muppets', 'so', 'close', 'home', 'overly', 'polished', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'away', 'Indie', 'atmosphere', 'was', 'always', 'present', 'Henson', 'era', 'Muppets', 'always', 'felt', 'charming', 'low', 'budget', 'variety', 'troupe', 'verge', 'making', 'when', 'have', 'back', 'up', 'crew', '40', 'dancers', 'lose', 'When', 'lose', 'really', 'lose', 'novelty', 'consolation', 'two', 'star', 'review', 'believe', 'Segal', 'did', 'best', 'think', 'nostalgia', 'element', 'there', 'certainly', 'appreciate', 'fan', 'not', 'Hollywood', 'Exec', 'just', 'trying', 'make', 'buck', 'how', 'ironic', 'think', 'unwittingly', 'proved', 'Henson', 'much', 'stronger', 'understanding', 'Henson', 'attempt', 'revive', 'franchise', 'probably', 'not', 'worth', 'suspicion', 'always', 'been', 'Henson', 'franchise', 'dead', 'looks', 'still', 'left', 'many', 'wonderful', 'hours', 'old', 'Muppets', 'DVD', 'were', 'anyone', 'would', 'rewatch', 'old', 'Muppets', 'wish', 'relive', 'glory', 'Skip', 'little', 'number', 'ai', ""n't"", 'worth']",The Muppets

1402682,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B004EPZ03O,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[1, 1]","The Muppets have always been a curious relic of a bygone era of entertainment, much like Bugs Bunny and the rest of the Looney Tunes gang.  They still carry the torch for vaudeville, only in the case of the Muppets it's a show about putting on a show.  The ""Muppet Show"" regularly broke the fourth wall in a way that only stage performers can, but that meta-awareness has since become rote in the age of hyper-media saturation. Can the Muppets still be relevant in the Internet era?""The Muppets"" wisely doesn't try to update the titular puppets so much as resurrect them, reintroducing Kermit (Steve Whitmire) and company in a ""get the gang back together to save the show"" plot.  It works, because it's the Muppets, and cheesy is what they do.Less successful are the dual narratives at the center of the film.  Gary (Jason Segel) and Walter (Peter Linz) are brothers with one important difference: Gary is a human and Walter is a Muppet.  Gary has grown up and has a girlfriend Mary (adorable Amy Adams, who looks like she was pregnant through most of the film).  Walter has...his obsession with the Muppets.  These two worlds are destined to collide on a fateful road trip Hollywood.The abandoned Muppet studio is in a sorry state, and it soon becomes clear that Kermit and Miss Piggy (Eric Jacobson) have broken up. With the rest of the Muppets scattered, it's up to our heroes to convince Kermit to reunite with his beloved, get the band back together (literally), and put on a show that will raise $10 million before villainous oil baron Tex Richman (Chris Cooper) can get his hands on the plot.What ensues is a series of madcap homages to other films, subtle references to Muppet canon, and lots of plot-bending gags like ""traveling by map."" These jokes aren't so much funny as they are ironic, which is what the Muppet always excelled at.  Jack Black, playing himself, demonstrates the brilliance of the Muppets when Fozzie Bear (Eric Jacobson) begins a lame routine and Black reacts by mocking him.  The audience eats it up, and we do too - not because the Muppets are always funny, but because they're always game, often lame, and in on the joke.Different plot points resolve at their own pace, and to Segel's writing credit, almost all of them resolve in a satisfactory fashion.  Villains are defeated, romances rekindled, and our beloved Muppets play all the songs we remember best.  The funniest gags comes from a new Muppet, 80's Robot (Matt Vogel), who is there exclusively to keep us Gen Xers entertained.Unfortunately the weakest link is central to the film.  Walter is a generic Muppet with almost no character development other than his adoration of Kermit.

1402686,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B004EPZ03O,mirasreviews,"[0, 0]","Thirty years after ""The Muppet Show"" went off  the air, I wondered what a new Muppet movie would have to offer. Apparently, its creators were wondering the same thing, because ""The Muppets"" asks, literally, if the Muppets are still relevant in today's world. Walter (Peter Linz) is a Muppet who grew up with a human brother Gary (Jason Segel), and he is a huge fan of The Muppets well into adulthood. Gary plans an anniversary trip to Los Angeles with his girlfriend Mary (Amy Adams) and Walter. There they discover that the Muppets have disbanded, and Muppet Studios will fall into the hands of an oil baron (Chris Cooper) who wants to tear it down unless Kermit the Frog (Steve Whitmire) can buy the theater back for $10 million. They only way to do that is to host a Muppet Telethon with all the old gang.Though ""The Muppet Show"" was intended to entertain children and adults alike, it always seemed like the words were intended for the adults and the actions were aimed at the children in the audience. ""The Muppets"", the movie, actually parodies children's programming at times. The self-consciously corny musical numbers are all parodies of something. There is some stinging humor and vicious mockery here, couched in smiling song and dance numbers. There are also the requisite comic interactions between the Muppet performers: Kermit, Miss Piggy (Eric Jacobson), Fozzie Bear (Eric Jacobson), Gonzo (David Goelz), and the rest. I have to admit it's nice to see the Muppets again, especially once the Telethon gets underway.I was surprised by how reflexive ""The Muppets"" is, but the relevance or irrelevance of The Muppets is an obvious choice of theme, isn't it? If the filmmakers were wondering how much audience a Muppet movie could possibly have in 2011, why not make the movie about that very subject? It's more economical than searching for other inspiration. When Kermit wants to host a Muppet Telethon to raise money to save the studio, no network wants him. The motley crew of fuzzy puppets are assumed to no longer be relevant. Even Tex Richman, the oil baron, says so. Well, Kermit gets a break and a chance to find out if The Muppets can play to a modern audience.

Writer and star Jason Segel clearly puts the characters in an exalted place with this lovely reunion.  He plays Gary, from Smalltown, USA where he grew up along with his ""brother,"" a Muppet who doesn't know it, named Walter.  His longtime girlfriend Mary (Amy Adams, who perfected her song and dance role in 2007's ""Enchanted"") is eager to spend some alone-time with Gary but relents when he takes along Walter to a trip to The Muppet Studio.  When they get there, they find it in total disrepair and pledge to find Kermit in an effort to put the group back together again.The studio is about to be acquired by an evil investor named Tex Richman (Chris Cooper) unless the gang can raise $10 million.  The film is lightweight fare of course but there is no denying the affection for Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie, Gonzo and the rest.  There are enough jokes for the adults to appreciate and enough of a message to instill in the youngsters.  The film is laden with cameos including Zach Galifianakis, Jim Parsons, Dave Grohl (Foofighters), James Carville, Selena Gomez, Neil Patrick Harris, and many others.

1402691,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,B004EPZ03O,Monty Moonlight,"[4, 4]","After what seemed like a lifetime without anything up to their usual standards coming from the Muppets (even their attempt at a Muppet Wizard of Oz film was somehow botched), a very serious fan approached Disney Studios with a desire to make a movie that would restore the fantastic, felt funnymen to their former glory. That man was actor Jason Segel (""Forgetting Sarah Marshall""), and that film would come to be known as ""The Muppets"".The plot initially sounded like a bad idea. The Muppets have to reunite to put on a show in order to save the Muppet Studios from a greedy oil tycoon who wants to tear it down for drilling. Seemed like something we'd seen a hundred times before, even in ""It's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie"", let alone the Blues Brothers"". But, hey, that's sort of the joke. Even the oil tycoon here is played as a complete parody of the greedy businessman villain role, and in this film, it all works! The plot, of course, is meant to harken back to those old Mickey Rooney/Judy Garland ""let's put on a show"" classics, Mickey even doing one of the many brief celebrity cameos in the film. It's all very nostalgic and charming, which is a big part of what this film means to be and achieves wonderfully. This movie is about the Muppets, and putting on a show is what they do best. It's also a very smart film about reclaiming something you've lost while still staying true to yourself and what you love. It's about not giving up, but trying your best and facing the outcome either way. And, to be totally blunt, it's about how The Muppets lost their fame and how they try to gain it back. And, in a way, the film makes its own true story.To get into detail here, Walter is a puppet born into a human family (no, we don't see how). His human brother Gary (Jason Segel) is also his best friend. Growing up, Walter was clearly a bit different, and this was a struggle for him until he discovered the original Muppet Show. Walter and Gary became big fans, but especially Walter. Kermit was his hero. After we see this bit of Gary and Walter history, we come to present day, in which Walter and Gary are adults, and Gary is planning to propose to his girlfriend, Mary (the beautiful and adorable Amy Adams), on an anniversary trip they are taking to Los Angeles. Mary is a bit disappointed that Walter is coming along, though she doesn't let it show. But, Gary has promised to take Walter to tour the Muppet Studios, and so they all plan to have a great time together. Once there however, they discover the Muppet Studios is a wreck, and the tour is a dud. Walter sneaks away from the group and into Kermit's old office though, and there he overhears a business deal selling the Muppet Studios to greedy oil tycoon Tex Richman (Chris Cooper). He then hears Richman brag to his lackeys that, rather than make a museum out of the place, he really intends to tear it down and drill for oil! A traumatized Walter returns to Gary and Mary with the news, and the three friends seek out Kermit the Frog to save the Muppet Studios from destruction. Unfortunately, Kermit has lost touch with the other Muppets, and so begins a quest to gather them up and put on a telethon (if they can get a celebrity host) to save the Studios and the very Muppet name!The whole film is hilarious and heartwarming, with scenes that will bring tears to nostalgic eyes and even newcomers. This truly is an ""old school"" Muppet film (complete with a recreation of the Muppet Show opening and very true to the show yet very modern sketches), and it is successful on all fronts. The cast is perfect, the cameos and return of classic Muppets are delightful, and don't get me started on the songs. They were done by none other than ""Flight of the Conchords"" genius Bret McKenzie, and if you're a fan of that show, you'll be able to tell (if you're not familiar, trust me, it's a good thing, a very good thing). One of them even took home the Oscar for Best Song, and deservedly so. ""Man or Muppet"" is simply brilliant, as are the visuals that go with it. It's probably everyone's favorite scene in this film full of great moment after great moment, and tons of wonderful music.Now, I'm not saying the film is flawless. It is brilliant, wonderful, a joyous and touching experience, but here is a little list of the only things I could possibly nitpick about off the top of my head. First, the old complaint about the Muppets' new voices still rings true. Kermit sounds better than he has in a while, though I've also gotten more used to him, but now we have to deal with the loss of Frank Oz, who just turned into a tremendous jerk at some point (if what I hear is true) and had to be replaced. Now, we have a Miss Piggy that sounds more manly than ever and a Fozzie who only sometimes sounds like Fozzie. It's tough, but you'll deal with it. This movie is too good not to. Second issue, there is one song in this film the villain performs. It's a rap, and it's not really a necessary song, and it could be funnier. Still, it's okay. The problem? On the Blu-Ray's deleted scenes, we can see the full scene/song rather than the edited version that is in the final film, and ya know what, it is so much better and it actually gives the song purpose. It tells us why he really hates the Muppets, explains his ""maniacal laugh"" joke (he actually doesn't know how to laugh, which has to do with why he hates the Muppets but isn't the whole story), and it has funnier lyrics than we get in the shorter version. So, yeah, cutting that song short was a mistake. Thirdly, where was Robin? Or Bean Bunny? And not a single line for Rizzo? Robin is too important to have zero lines, and Rizzo by now is too. I realize they had a lot of Muppets to try and stick in here, and there was a desire to give screen time to those that haven't had any for a while, and that is much appreciated, but I wish Rizzo had at least one joke, much like the one given to Pepe. That was perfect handling of Pepe, whom I enjoy but has gotten way too much spotlight in past several years. Rizzo perhaps was becoming too important too, but he deserved at least a joke. As for Robin and Bean, Robin is classic, and Bean I just don't want to see totally disappear. He takes me back to Jim's last years with us. And finally, the complaint so popular with internet reviewers, the ending of the film resolves a few loose ends rather quickly and in a way that, some might say, cheapens the overall message. I can see how they kinda had to do it that way. I mean, it didn't have to be such a contrived, quicky-quick way of going about it, but they certainly couldn't leave things the way the were. Maybe if the Muppet name hadn't been part of the contract, but that's how it is and, again, it's not something I can't live with. And, those are really the only things I can nit-pick about this still completely fantastic film. But, the real question now is, what will they do for the next big Muppet film? They're already planning it, Segel's co-writer from this one, Nicholas Stoller, is back on board to write and James Bobin, director of this film, will return to direct as well, but no Jason Segel. I've heard entirely that he was the heart and soul of this project and it's truth to the classic Muppets, so here's hoping Stoller and Bobin had a healthy hand in that as well, in reality. I'm really wondering what sort of plot they'll have though. This time it's going to have to be a lot more original, probably.Now, about the ""Wocka Wocka Value Pack"" Blu-Ray, DVD, Digital Copy, and Soundtrack release. First, I'll say that I would have been quite satisfied with just the Blu-Ray and DVD. I don't even need the DVD, but I think it's nice to have in the more basic format if I wanna take it to watch at someone else's house or something. A lot of people don't have Blu-Ray players even today. I couldn't care less about digital copies. I don't have anything to play them on and wouldn't want to watch a movie on a tiny screen anyway. As for the soundtrack (which is also only a digital version), I already bought it on CD. BUT, with the online coupon from DisneyMovieRewards, the price made it cheaper than buying the non-Wocka Wocka version, so that's cool. Anyway, naturally, great, anamorphic picture, great sound, and the extras here are brilliant (incidentally, I found at least one Easter Egg). The ""Making Of"" documentary is done in a clever, British educational film style. Very funny, and as with all the bonus features, the Muppet performers stay in character. Even in the blooper reel, which is also fantastically entertaining. There are plenty of deleted scenes too, full of cut cameos. As I mentioned before, we get the great, full length Tex Richman song as a bonus feature as well. There's also a great screen test that doubles as a comedic short film about screen tests, all those great Muppet movie trailer parodies (save for that most recent ""Hunger Games"" one to promote this Blu-Ray), and certainly the most significant bonus feature, the audio commentary with writer and star Segel, co-writer Stroller, and director James Bobin. The audio commentary is one of those really fun commentaries, even if the Muppets don't take part (a Muppet commentary would have been fun too though). Segel's endless, joking Disney plugs are pretty delightful. There's a ton of joking, but we do get insight into the film as well.Oh, and before I forget, this Disney Blu-Ray is equipped with something new, ""Disney Intermission"". This new enhancement has its good and bad points. Basically, when you press pause in a film, the screen switches to an intermission mode in which you are entertained by teasers from the bonus features. This is actually a great idea, and you can press pause a second time to pause the intermission mode if you don't want to see it (ENTER takes you back to the film). The issue you might have with it though, is if you are pausing the film to get a better look at something. Luckily, you CAN turn off the ""Disney Intermission"", and I assume that would remedy this issue after a bit of a hassle.All in all, this film is a must, and I believe it's something Jim Henson would smile down upon. It's of course particularly good for the Muppet fanatic, but, hey, I know someone who had never seen the Muppets before this and absolutely loved it, so I say everyone should see this!

I wonder how much research Jason Segel and Nicholas Stoller had to do to write this script...it definitely paid off big time and they must have fulfilled ten of their lifelong dreams.  This film brought back the Muppets we know and love while properly setting them in our modern society.  Moopet also stepped into the ""leading man's"" shoes alongside a brand-new Muppet named Walter, the two of them believable playing loving brothers...it'd have been more believable if they feuded now and again, but it's a Muppet movie.  A movie can never go wrong with casting Amy Adams, especially if there's singing involved, and this leading lady did not disappoint.  I did find her introduction scene a bit weird.  Yes, having her play a shop teacher made perfect sense down the line, but the students being disappointed about going on spring break was definitely far-fetched, even by the Muppets' standards.  Then again, if Amy Adams was my teacher...okay, I'll just keep it PG...let's move on.  Chris Cooper and his Muppet/Moopet minions were perfectly slimy and villainy and you'll love what happens with all of them in the end.  Like its predecessors, this film restricted using CGI effects as much as possible and instead gave us our beloved Muppets live and in color...and fur.  And you could never fault them for that, mainly because it worked just as well as it always has.  Whether this is your first Muppet movie or you're a long-time fan, this film will undoubtedly prove that the Muppets still got it...and let's take a moment and welcome Walter (applause.)

On a trip to LA with Gary and his long-time girlfriend Mary, Walter, who was so excited to see the Muppet Theater, finds it in disarray. What's worse, he overhears a conversation implying an oil tycoon will tear down the theater and drill for oil if the Muppets can't raise $10 million. Walter appeals to Kermit and together they bring the old gang back together. However, with only 48 hours left until showtime, and the feeling that America may have forgotten their one time beloved characters, Walter finds that he may be the Muppets' only hope. New musical numbers and interspersed with classic tunes, in this lovable, quirky, and downright cheesy movie!For me, the Muppets represent a timeless brand of humor and entertainment that has survived decades.

Jason Segel (Marshall from HIMYM) co-wrote and co-starred in this, and there were several cameos from other talented actors: Whoopi Goldberg, Emily Blunt, Segel's fellow HIMYM actor Neil Patrick Harris, Selena Gomez, Jim Parsons, Mickey Rooney...as well as others.Even though a vast majority of the actors in this are puppets, they stir in you deep emotions that you can't help but feel. You will definitely be touched by their passion and perseverance, courage and camaraderie.This is definitely something I will watch again.

1402721,A1BPCX5TX2HNRQ,B004EPZ03O,Russ Nickel,"[5, 8]","The Muppets was incredible! While the movie is light-hearted enough to appeal to children, it also spends a great deal of its time making fun of how ridiculously upstanding it is, all the while tossing in plenty of humor for adults. It's the first movie I've ever seen in theaters where I walked out of there sure that only a monster could dislike such unadulterated greatness (my apologies to all you non-monstrous Muppet-dislikers out there. I'm sure you have good reasons).The basic plot of this movie is genius. An oil Baron cleverly named Tex Richman is planning on buying the rights to The Muppets Studio, pretending that he wants to build a museum when really the studio sits on vast quantities of oil. He knows this because he ""Can smell it. Also, the geological surveyors said there was."" Our hero and new addition to the Muppets cast, Walter, is the only one who overhears the evil madman, and it's up to him to help get the Muppets back together for one last show so they can raise the ten million dollars necessary to buy back the studio and simultaneously prove that the Muppets still have what it takes in this ever-changing world.The crew has to be tracked down, Animal must reacquire his inner rage in order to drum, Kermit and Ms. Piggy must reconcile their rocky relationship, a celebrity host must be secured, and Walter has to find a talent, all in two weeks!One of the main reasons I got such a kick out of The Muppets is because it was relentlessly meta. I recently found out that this was a term unknown to my parental units, so for all you un-meta-educated out there, something is considered meta when it breaks the fourth wall. It describes that whole play-within-a-play routine where the characters are aware that they aren't real and constantly acknowledge that it's all just a show. In The Muppets, this manifests itself in a number of hilarious ways. For example, they'll have a huge song and dance number, standard for a kids' movie. But as soon as it ends, all the back-up dancers collapse in exhaustion, finally happy that the main characters are gone and their duties to the audience are over.Even more amusing is when the two old guys (probably the funniest Muppets), read out the key details of the oil baron's contract, stating that it's fool-proof except for one minor detail. If the Muppets can manage to raise the money in time, they have first right of purchase. One old guy then says, ""It sounds like you just explained an important plot point,"" and the other responds, ""I sure hope so! Otherwise I just bored the audience half-to-death for no reason!""The movie falls into all the traps of an easy-to-follow children's film, but it's well-aware of it, and by pointing out its ridiculousness, The Muppets can have its cake and eat it too. The kids are happy with the simplistic plot, and the adults can crack up at the way that simple plot is parodied. In fact, the entire movie is one giant endeavor in meta-narrative. The film is about the Muppets being able to prove that they're still relevant, that they can still make people laugh. They want to show the world that in a time when television and film are shifting toward either the unintelligent, irreverent comedy of things like Dinner of Schmucks, or the dark gritty edge of new superhero reboots, the wholesome and clever entertainment of the Muppets still has a place. Children are not as stupid as we think, and the Muppets believe they deserve well-written film with a positive message. In this case, that is the message, and The Muppets proves its point with every top-notch joke and clever spoof.As you watch the film, you're sure to enjoy it, and that very fact proves the film right. Realizing that will make you enjoy the film more, thus proving it right further. They've managed to create an endless feedback loop!As always, Jason Segel is eminently lovable, and his man-child character is no different here. He plays Walter's brother, and his conflict is that he cares too much about his furrier sibling, sometimes accidentally ignoring girlfriend Amy Adams. Chris Cooper's Tex Richman is a fantastic villain, and his one song catches you totally off-guard, then proceeds to be hilarious. In fact, with the exception of one Ms. Piggy/Amy Adams duet that I found slightly off, the songs were fantastic.Like I said, you will enjoy this movie, and the more of that childish joy you still have within yourself, the more you'll like it. I would recommend this to everyone, and I'm doing so now (though if you're extremely put-off by kids' movies, you'll probably just find it to be one of the more excellent examples of such, rather than anything that will knock your socks off). The film deftly balances genres, managing to be a perfect kids' movie whilst simultaneously parodying dozens if not hundreds of movie conventions.Check out more on ""The Nickel Screen""",4,The Muppets

I reluctantly watched this movie just because my wife insisted on it.  By the time it was over I was saying ""We are going to have to own this"".The writers did an incredible job bringing the Muppets into this era.  If this had been a standard Muppet movie, with all of the Muppets being the main cast and centered around another ""Muppet Caper""  it would have been a straight to DVD release.  The writers were very smart to bring the Muppets back by making the story ABOUT bringing the Muppets back.  Another great aspect of this was the balance of nostalgia and new material.  I'd say, off the top of my head, that the music in the movie was split into thirds, one part classic Muppet songs, one part new material and one part popular songs of this era performed by the Muppets.  It was a perfect balance of ""Oh man, I haven't heard that song in decades"" (and then not being able to get it out of your head for days) and listening to new songs that give the movie a fresh feel.  It was heartwarming to see the Muppets ""get back together"" throughout the course of the story.I will say that it was only my wife and I that watched this, no kids.  I believe she liked it because of the nostalgic aspects and I liked it just because it was damn good writing.  To be able to balance nostalgia, bring an otherwise outdated concept into a modern context and breath some new life into it with original material couldn't have been an easy feat, but these guys did it.  I can't comment on how kids would feel about this movie though.The parallel story of the two humans in the story is pretty basic.  I would have loved to see more out of Amy Adams, I believe her to be a great actress, but it was a Muppet Movie so it's not like there was room for heavy emotional conflict.The one thing about the movie that I didn't like was the main Villain.  I hate to say it, but part of me buys into the whole idea of the evil oil baron being written into the script as a stab at the political right.  I personally don't care, but it was a little out of place to think that an oil rig would have been built on half a block in Hollywood.  There would have been so many more plausible scenarios for that.  I don't believe that it was a conspiracy to brainwash our youth, as some apparently do, but I can't see it as anything other than a conscious political decision.  Still, at the end of the day I think I could watch this movie 5 more times before I even start getting bored with it so I'll keep it at 5 stars.",5,And I didn't even want to watch it in the first place,1335139200,"04 23, 2012",2012,2652,"['grew', 'up', 'Muppets', 'watched', 'TV', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'definitely', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'have', 'kind', 'soft', 'spot', 'heart', 'reluctantly', 'watched', 'movie', 'just', 'wife', 'insisted', 'time', 'was', 'was', 'saying', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'own', 'writers', 'did', 'incredible', 'job', 'bringing', 'Muppets', 'era', 'had', 'been', 'standard', 'Muppet', 'movie', 'Muppets', 'being', 'main', 'cast', 'centered', 'Muppet', 'Caper', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'straight', 'DVD', 'release', 'writers', 'were', 'very', 'smart', 'bring', 'Muppets', 'back', 'making', 'story', 'bringing', 'Muppets', 'back', 'great', 'aspect', 'was', 'balance', 'nostalgia', 'new', 'material', ""'d"", 'say', 'off', 'top', 'head', 'music', 'movie', 'was', 'split', 'thirds', 'one', 'part', 'classic', 'Muppet', 'songs', 'one', 'part', 'new', 'material', 'one', 'part', 'popular', 'songs', 'era', 'performed', 'Muppets', 'was', 'perfect', 'balance', 'Oh', 'man', 'have', ""n't"", 'heard', 'song', 'decades', 'then', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'get', 'head', 'days', 'listening', 'new', 'songs', 'give', 'movie', 'fresh', 'feel', 'was', 'heartwarming', 'see', 'Muppets', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'course', 'story.I', 'will', 'say', 'was', 'only', 'wife', 'that', 'watched', 'kids', 'believe', 'liked', 'nostalgic', 'aspects', 'liked', 'just', 'was', 'damn', 'good', 'writing', 'be', 'able', 'balance', 'nostalgia', 'bring', 'otherwise', 'outdated', 'concept', 'modern', 'context', 'breath', 'new', 'life', 'original', 'material', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'easy', 'feat', 'guys', 'did', 'ca', ""n't"", 'comment', 'how', 'kids', 'would', 'feel', 'movie', 'though.The', 'parallel', 'story', 'two', 'humans', 'story', 'pretty', 'basic', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'see', 'more', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'believe', 'be', 'great', 'actress', 'was', 'Muppet', 'Movie', 'not', 'was', 'room', 'heavy', 'emotional', 'conflict.The', 'one', 'thing', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'was', 'main', 'Villain', 'hate', 'say', 'part', 'whole', 'idea', 'evil', 'oil', 'baron', 'being', 'written', 'script', 'stab', 'political', 'right', 'personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'was', 'little', 'place', 'think', 'oil', 'rig', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'built', 'block', 'Hollywood', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'many', 'more', 'plausible', 'scenarios', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'was', 'conspiracy', 'brainwash', 'youth', 'apparently', 'do', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'anything', 'other', 'conscious', 'political', 'decision', 'Still', 'end', 'day', 'think', 'could', 'watch', 'movie', '5', 'more', 'times', 'even', 'start', 'getting', 'bored', 'so', ""'ll"", 'keep', '5', 'stars']",The Muppets

The Muppets manage to produce a blend of entertainment that is funny and engaging (and appropriate) for kids, while having another layer that makes it equally entertaining for adults.For example, in this new installment, during one of the opening song and dance numbers, the crowd of singing/dancing people and Muppets move down a backlot city street, and they pass a hippy who looks very much like Willie Nelson, who pipes up to sing the word ""high"" in the song.Now, for our toddler daughter this meant nothing (other than a funny looking guy singing), but my wife and I cracked up.Similarly, during the finale when the Muppets are putting on a show, there is a number performed solely by chickens, and it's a cover of Cee Lo Green's song 'Forget You'.  Sung by chickens.  Chickens who cluck.  As in, cluck you, which is remarkably close to the uncensored version of that song.Again, that will fly over younger kid's heads, but I had to pause the movie and LOL for a bit, then rewind and see it again.  Classic Muppet stuff.And it's not just about the subversive bits, or the cameos, either.  The film feels true to the sensibilities of the Muppets, and, frankly, I've been worried about them becoming assimilated by Disney and turned into...well, who knows what, but not what they were.

I take a great deal of pride in my love of the muppets, more than any grown man in his thirties probably should, but I suspected that Jason Siegal did more so. He did a loving and funny homage to the gang fronted by Kermit the Frog in his star vehicleForgetting Sarah Marshall (Unrated), so I had high hopes and a good feeling when I learned that he was writing this new incarnation for a new generation. Alas, the writing just may be this movies biggest flaw. It's packed with weak jokes, recycled from old muppet shows and films, a storyline that is blah, and new characters who are flat (even by muppet standards) and uninteresting.Take the new muppet and central character of the film, I hesitate to call him a hero, his name is Walter and he is neither funny nor interesting. He seems like a reject muppet character who finally landed a role because he's friends with the director or the writer(!). Though Siegal himself fairs little better, with dumb jokes and a bland personality, poor Amy Adams, a great talent who looks confused much of the time, but still does her best to put her game face on and seems at home in her musical numbers. Chris Cooper, an Oscar winner is the one dimensional villain, with an unimaginative name, Tex Richman, he's also not funny, but he does keep a straight face while performing a misguided rap number. There are also a lot of pointless cameos, why James Carvell(?), I don't even think that most of them are meant to be funny.There are charming moments, a lot of smiles, but few genuine laughs. Kermit and the gang are always welcome visitors for me, but it takes Kermie twenty minutes to even show up in this movie and Miss Piggy has more an extended guest appearance, she's also not voiced by her muppeteer maestro Frank Oz.

1402734,A1GZ34D8AEE0SW,B004EPZ03O,"S. Stevenson ""FictionAddict""","[4, 7]","When I first saw the trailers for the new Muppet movie simply titled THE MUPPETS, I was worried. Let's just say the Muppets haven't had the best track record since switching over to Walt Disney Studios ownership. Or for that matter, since the beloved Jim Henson passed away. And while THE MUPPET CHRISTMAS CAROL and MUPPET TREASURE ISLAND were decent pictures, they really could never match the magic of the 1979 THE MUPPET MOVIE or THE GREAT MUPPET CAPER even. And as the years passed from the abysmal MUPPETS FROM SPACE, I wrote off any future Muppet releases ever being good again.Until I finally caved and went to see THE MUPPETS with a friend. And I am so glad I did. Jason Segel and Nicholas Stoller have really delivered an amazing script that takes viewers back to what Jim Henson had always hoped the Muppets would bring: that wonderful happiness melded with a childhood nostalgia that really doesn't fade away after the credits roll.The story begins with bright eyed Gary and his Muppet brother Walter who are planning a trip with Gary's girlfriend Mary (played by Amy Adams) to Los Angeles. While there, Muppet fan Walter plans on visiting the Muppet Studios. But when the threesome arrives, they discover the entire place is completely abandoned and rundown. But that's also when they discover that an evil oil baron, Tex Richman (Chris Cooper) plans on destroying the Muppet Studios and drilling for oil. What ensues is a wild romp to regather the Muppet family and put on one last show to raise ten million dollars and save the Studios.The best part of this entire venture is how the Muppets can get away with poking fun at themselves while remaining completely innocent in doing so. The best jokes come from moments where we find out what has happened to all the Muppets -- and the constant poking at not being in popular culture any longer. It's absolutely perfect. I found myself laughing harder than any kids in the audience as small moments popped through referencing previous films and THE MUPPET SHOW itself. From the wonderful 1980's Robot using its modem to the offbeat ""Moopets"" -- replacements for the original Muppets -- the humor is spot on.The music is spectacular. It really harkens back to what Paul Williams used to do not only on THE MUPPET SHOW, but also in THE MUPPET MOVIE. The dancing and singing is well executed and I kept feeling amazed at the song lyrics. Not only are they great musically, but the writing was smart and never clich&eacute;. And as the opening number, ""Life's A Happy Song"" begins, I could not stop smiling. I knew it from those first moments: the Muppets I knew and loved were back. And hopefully this time for good.Acting is top notch -- as Amy Adams and Jason Segel play bright and cheery adults who never come across as being cornball. It definitely has a hair of camp factor, but Adams and Segel pull it off brilliantly. The cameo performances are perfect -- never overwhelming, and always at the right moments. Some are definitely highly laugh-worthy, such as while Walter sings through his conflicts, a human version of himself appears in the mirror played by THE BIG BANG THEORY's Jim Parsons.Be warned: there are not only numerous moments of laughter, but also some tear-inducing moments. Such as when Kermit walks around his empty mansion and reminisces on the past. THE MUPPET MOVIE inspired me as a kid in so many ways, and THE MUPPETS has the power to do that for a whole new generation of kids. And I know that this is exactly the sort of film Jim Henson would be extremely proud of. I know I am. And for all the lovers and dreamers who grew up on The Muppets, this is not a film to miss.",5,"The Lovers, The Dreamers, And Me",1322352000,"11 27, 2011",2011,3659,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'trailers', 'new', 'Muppet', 'movie', 'simply', 'titled', 'THE', 'MUPPETS', 'was', 'worried', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'Muppets', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'best', 'track', 'record', 'switching', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Studios', 'ownership', 'matter', 'beloved', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'passed', 'away', 'THE', 'MUPPET', 'CHRISTMAS', 'CAROL', 'MUPPET', 'TREASURE', 'ISLAND', 'were', 'decent', 'pictures', 'really', 'could', 'never', 'match', 'magic', '1979', 'THE', 'MUPPET', 'MOVIE', 'THE', 'GREAT', 'MUPPET', 'CAPER', 'even', 'years', 'passed', 'abysmal', 'MUPPETS', 'FROM', 'SPACE', 'wrote', 'off', 'future', 'Muppet', 'releases', 'ever', 'being', 'good', 'again.Until', 'finally', 'caved', 'went', 'see', 'THE', 'MUPPETS', 'friend', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'did', 'Jason', 'Segel', 'Nicholas', 'Stoller', 'have', 'really', 'delivered', 'amazing', 'script', 'viewers', 'back', 'what', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'had', 'always', 'hoped', 'Muppets', 'would', 'bring', 'wonderful', 'happiness', 'melded', 'childhood', 'nostalgia', 'really', ""n't"", 'fade', 'away', 'credits', 'roll.The', 'story', 'begins', 'bright', 'eyed', 'Gary', 'Muppet', 'brother', 'Walter', 'who', 'are', 'planning', 'trip', 'Gary', 'girlfriend', 'Mary', 'played', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'there', 'Muppet', 'fan', 'Walter', 'visiting', 'Muppet', 'Studios', 'when', 'threesome', 'discover', 'entire', 'place', 'completely', 'abandoned', 'rundown', 'also', 'when', 'discover', 'evil', 'oil', 'baron', 'Tex', 'Richman', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'destroying', 'Muppet', 'Studios', 'drilling', 'oil', 'What', 'wild', 'romp', 'regather', 'Muppet', 'family', 'put', 'one', 'last', 'show', 'raise', 'ten', 'million', 'dollars', 'save', 'Studios.The', 'best', 'part', 'entire', 'venture', 'how', 'Muppets', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'poking', 'fun', 'remaining', 'completely', 'innocent', 'doing', 'so', 'best', 'jokes', 'come', 'moments', 'where', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'Muppets', 'constant', 'poking', 'not', 'being', 'popular', 'culture', 'longer', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'found', 'laughing', 'harder', 'kids', 'audience', 'small', 'moments', 'popped', 'referencing', 'previous', 'films', 'THE', 'MUPPET', 'SHOW', 'wonderful', '1980', 'Robot', 'using', 'modem', 'offbeat', 'Moopets', 'replacements', 'original', 'Muppets', 'humor', 'spot', 'on.The', 'music', 'spectacular', 'really', 'back', 'what', 'Paul', 'Williams', 'used', 'do', 'not', 'only', 'THE', 'MUPPET', 'SHOW', 'also', 'THE', 'MUPPET', 'MOVIE', 'dancing', 'singing', 'well', 'executed', 'kept', 'feeling', 'amazed', 'song', 'lyrics', 'Not', 'only', 'are', 'great', 'musically', 'writing', 'was', 'smart', 'never', 'clich', 'eacute', 'opening', 'number', 'Life', 'A', 'Happy', 'Song', 'could', 'not', 'stop', 'smiling', 'knew', 'first', 'moments', 'Muppets', 'knew', 'loved', 'were', 'back', 'hopefully', 'time', 'good.Acting', 'top', 'notch', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'Jason', 'Segel', 'play', 'bright', 'cheery', 'adults', 'who', 'never', 'come', 'being', 'cornball', 'definitely', 'hair', 'camp', 'factor', 'Adams', 'Segel', 'pull', 'off', 'brilliantly', 'cameo', 'performances', 'are', 'perfect', 'never', 'overwhelming', 'always', 'right', 'moments', 'are', 'definitely', 'highly', 'laugh-worthy', 'such', 'Walter', 'sings', 'conflicts', 'human', 'version', 'mirror', 'played', 'THE', 'BIG', 'BANG', 'THEORY', 'Jim', 'Parsons.Be', 'warned', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'numerous', 'moments', 'laughter', 'also', 'tear-inducing', 'moments', 'Such', 'when', 'Kermit', 'walks', 'empty', 'mansion', 'reminisces', 'past', 'MUPPET', 'MOVIE', 'inspired', 'kid', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'THE', 'MUPPETS', 'power', 'do', 'whole', 'new', 'generation', 'kids', 'know', 'exactly', 'sort', 'film', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'would', 'be', 'extremely', 'proud', 'know', 'am', 'lovers', 'dreamers', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'Muppets', 'not', 'film', 'miss']",The Muppets
1402735,A1C9GCHR99WX3F,B004EPZ03O,Stephen Verhaeren,"[0, 0]","The Muppets are back with a movie that went to movie theaters for the first time since 1999's Muppets From Space even through they did have a couple of made for TV movies. And you might also expect that the Muppets have broken up and are apart from each other. The movie also got its first Oscar for the song Man or a Muppet, which can be unbelievable as some from earlier movies you might have thought would have gotten, but maybe they were not worthy for them. The movie even has Amy Adams that was no near as famous as she is now the last time the Muppets had a movie that went to movie theaters. As the movie opens you see a character that looks like a Muppet named Walter (Peter Linz) growing up in Smalltown with his brother Gary (Jason Segel) and they grow up as high fans of the Muppets even with a tape of their old TV show. And now as adults Gary and his girlfriend Mary (Amy Adams) have now been a couple for 10 years, and as part of it he is taking her to Los Angeles for a vacation. And Walter sounds down about not getting to go, until Gary pulls a surprise  that he has got him a ticket to go too which includes a tour of the Muppets Studios. Mary works as a teacher at a school, that she is going on a 2 week spring break. And that begins when Gary picks her up for the trip. THen they take a bus to Los Angeles, which they hit to the first stop which is and you guessed it the Muppet Studios, where they met a short tour group which is led by Alan Arkin. The tour stops includes the outside of  Kermit's office, when nobody is looking Walter enters the office, and is hidden under a table, where he sees Statler and Waldorf selling the Muppets Studios to Tex Richman (Chris Cooper ) and his henchmen Bobo the Bear and Uncle Deadly, and even explains that if the Muppets can raise 10 million dollars, before their contract expires they can purchase back the Muppet Studios which includes the Muppet theater of where did their show from. And when they are gone, and when Tex Richman thinks that his and his henchman are alone, he explains to them ""there is oil under the theater, and his plan is to destroy the theater, and drill for it. Unaware that Walter is under the table, and overheard his plan, and he catches up with Gary and Mary and is still screaming about what he has heard. And now the plan is to find Kermit the Frog, and to tell them what Walter has heard. They do mange to find his house, which Walter faints when he sees me, and reawakens in his home. He tells him about the plan, and Kermit says the only thing can can be done is to get the Muppets back and do a show,  and that is what they do. They mange to get most of the Muppets back, expect for Miss Piggy and now starts looking at channels to present their show on, which all gets rejected until they met with CDE executive Veronica (Rashida Jones) which she says no at first, and shows them what is popular, and where they are on as far as poplar which is not a big precent. But she does give them a timeslot of Punch Teacher, when they suddenly walk out and she has nothing else to replace it with. But the big condition she gives to the Muppets is to find a celebrity guest host. That is all that I am going to revel, and I am going to leave it up to you to find out what will happen. But I would have loved it if the movie had explained, well first how are Walter and Gary are brothers since when is a human, and the other a Muppet, and just what did happen that led to the break up of the Muppets even if it could have been explained to where it doesn't take up  a lot of the story.",5,The Muppets are back,1377993600,"09 1, 2013",2013,3577,"['Muppets', 'are', 'back', 'movie', 'went', 'movie', 'theaters', 'first', 'time', '1999', 'Muppets', 'Space', 'even', 'did', 'have', 'couple', 'made', 'TV', 'movies', 'might', 'also', 'expect', 'Muppets', 'have', 'broken', 'up', 'are', 'apart', 'other', 'movie', 'also', 'got', 'first', 'Oscar', 'song', 'Man', 'Muppet', 'can', 'be', 'unbelievable', 'earlier', 'movies', 'might', 'have', 'thought', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'maybe', 'were', 'not', 'worthy', 'movie', 'even', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'was', 'near', 'as', 'famous', 'now', 'last', 'time', 'Muppets', 'had', 'movie', 'went', 'movie', 'theaters', 'movie', 'see', 'character', 'Muppet', 'named', 'Walter', 'Peter', 'Linz', 'growing', 'up', 'Smalltown', 'brother', 'Gary', 'Jason', 'Segel', 'grow', 'up', 'as', 'high', 'fans', 'Muppets', 'even', 'tape', 'old', 'TV', 'show', 'now', 'adults', 'Gary', 'girlfriend', 'Mary', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'have', 'now', 'been', 'couple', '10', 'years', 'part', 'taking', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'vacation', 'Walter', 'down', 'about', 'not', 'getting', 'go', 'Gary', 'surprise', 'got', 'ticket', 'go', 'too', 'tour', 'Muppets', 'Studios', 'Mary', 'teacher', 'school', 'going', '2', 'week', 'spring', 'break', 'when', 'Gary', 'up', 'trip', 'take', 'bus', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'hit', 'first', 'stop', 'guessed', 'Muppet', 'Studios', 'where', 'met', 'short', 'tour', 'group', 'led', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'tour', 'stops', 'outside', 'Kermit', 'office', 'when', 'nobody', 'looking', 'Walter', 'office', 'hidden', 'table', 'where', 'Statler', 'Waldorf', 'selling', 'Muppets', 'Studios', 'Tex', 'Richman', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'henchmen', 'Bobo', 'Bear', 'Uncle', 'Deadly', 'even', 'Muppets', 'can', 'raise', '10', 'million', 'dollars', 'contract', 'can', 'purchase', 'back', 'Muppet', 'Studios', 'Muppet', 'theater', 'where', 'did', 'show', 'when', 'are', 'gone', 'when', 'Tex', 'Richman', 'henchman', 'are', 'alone', 'oil', 'theater', 'plan', 'destroy', 'theater', 'drill', 'Unaware', 'Walter', 'table', 'overheard', 'plan', 'up', 'Gary', 'Mary', 'still', 'screaming', 'what', 'heard', 'now', 'plan', 'find', 'Kermit', 'Frog', 'tell', 'what', 'Walter', 'heard', 'do', 'mange', 'find', 'house', 'Walter', 'faints', 'when', 'reawakens', 'home', 'plan', 'Kermit', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'get', 'Muppets', 'back', 'do', 'show', 'what', 'do', 'mange', 'get', 'most', 'Muppets', 'back', 'expect', 'Miss', 'Piggy', 'now', 'looking', 'channels', 'present', 'show', 'rejected', 'met', 'CDE', 'executive', 'Veronica', 'Rashida', 'Jones', 'first', 'what', 'popular', 'where', 'are', 'as', 'far', 'poplar', 'not', 'big', 'precent', 'give', 'timeslot', 'Punch', 'Teacher', 'when', 'suddenly', 'walk', 'out', 'nothing', 'else', 'replace', 'big', 'condition', 'Muppets', 'find', 'celebrity', 'guest', 'host', 'am', 'going', 'revel', 'am', 'going', 'leave', 'up', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'movie', 'had', 'explained', 'well', 'first', 'how', 'are', 'Walter', 'Gary', 'are', 'brothers', 'when', 'human', 'other', 'Muppet', 'just', 'what', 'did', 'happen', 'led', 'break', 'Muppets', 'even', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'explained', 'where', ""n't"", 'take', 'up', 'lot', 'story']",The Muppets

I downgraded my review because some of songs didn't ""work"" aurally and I was taken to task by a few folks because, at the time of my review, I had not seen the film. I was told that if I saw the film the songs would make sense. Well, I missed it in the theater but, based on the new Bluray DVD""Wocka-Wacka Pack"", I now understand the comments. And fully agree that the CD does work - if you've seen the film.But we are discussing the DVD here so I'll get to that. As of today there are over 80 reviews posted on Amazon. But Amazon has a policy of combining ALL reviews of a film, whether in theaters or on DVD. And with DVD all reviews are combined whether the single DVD or BD or special editions. I'm commenting here on the 3-Sisc Combo Pack which includes the DVD version with ONE bonus feature - The Blooper reel"", disc with a digital copy of the film and the BD with about 35 minutes of featurettes plus the Director's Commentary. The longest feature is the 15 minute ""Making of"" the film, there are nine deleted scenes totaling 10 minutes, The blooper reel runs eight minutes and the very funny ""trailer spoofs"" fill another nine minutes.The film is great and is perfect for ALL AGES. I certainly don't have to explain the Muppets to anyone. They are icons. The new songs this time are by Bret McKenzie (half of the ""Flight of the Conchords"" duo) and are really tuneful. (One of the featurettes has him discussing the styles he was trying to use). The plot goes back to the old Mickey (Rooney, not Mouse) and Judy (Garland) film musicals with the theme ""Let's put on a show and save the (insert cause here)!""I found the menu prompts a bit difficult to use and never was able to get the new ""Disney Intermission"" feature (where the Muppets take over the screen if you pause the film) but I'm not a technophile either. The Muppet ""Screen Tests"" were another fun feature.So it's now a few days since I watched the film and I'm still humming the tunes. (Oh yes, if you don't have the soundtrack CD you get a digital copy of the soundtrack with the ""Wocka-Wocka"" version.Kermit and Miss Piggy rule!

The three travel to Hollywood, where they learn that Kermit, Miss Piggy and other Muppet characters are not popular anymore. To protect their Muppet Studio from the greedy billionaire, the three travelers and Kermit plan to organize a show once again with other Muppet character to raise the money.With Gary, Mary and Walter as the main characters, the script (by Jason Segel and Nicholas Stoller) does not give much time for each Muppet character to shine. Chris Cooper plays ""Tex Richman,"" a villain attempting to sabotage the show. I am a fan of Chris Cooper, but with all respect he is hardly the right choice for the comedic role.But to me the biggest problem of ""The Muppets"" is the key concept of the film - people have forgotten the Muppets.

1402752,ARFCORBCTKX1J,B004EPZ03O,"William Sommerwerck ""grizzled geezer""","[0, 6]","I grew up in Baltimore County. We watched Washington TV as well as Baltimore's, and the Muppets were a delight. Their five-minute nightly show, ""Sam and Friends"", mostly comprised the Muppets doing goofy or weird versions of popular songs. (For example, Kermit plays with an inchworm that turns out to be the tip of the tail of a huge monster that swallows him.) Jim Henson also produced brilliant Muppet-based commercials for local businesses. (You can see these on YouTube. They are startlingly violent and downright nasty, even by modern standards.)As with Mickey Mouse cartoons, the Muppets were never intended as kiddie entertainment. But Americans -- whose ""taste"" in entertainment is virtually non-existent -- associate puppets and animated films with children. This, combined with the success of the Muppets as part of ""Sesame Street"", and their //failure// on SNL, cemented the view that the Muppets existed to provide cute, family-safe entertainment.Since then, the Muppets have done nothing the least-bit subversive (other than Sam the Eagle, who is an obvious poke at conservatives). Worse, almost everything they do is in a shallow show-biz vein. ""The Muppets"" is a rehash of their first film, when they try to break into show business. Only /this/ version is suffused with a maudlin sentimentality that gets worse as it progresses.Which isn't to say ""The Muppets"" doesn't have some very funny moments (I particularly liked the slap at Universal Orlando), but Brian Henson, et al, need to find a way to make the Muppets appealing to an intelligent adult audience. ""The Muppets Take South Park"", perhaps?PS: Note that Walter's discovering his attraction to the Muppets can be interpreted as a metaphor for ""something else"".PPS: Last night I saw a few minutes of Disney's ""The Country Bears"". Is it any surprise that both films share the same plot elements (""I'm not like the rest of my family"" + ""We've got to save the theater!"")?",3,the same old same-old,1333411200,"04 3, 2012",2012,1942,"['grew', 'up', 'Baltimore', 'County', 'watched', 'Washington', 'TV', 'as', 'well', 'Baltimore', 'Muppets', 'were', 'delight', 'five-minute', 'nightly', 'show', 'Sam', 'Friends', 'mostly', 'comprised', 'Muppets', 'doing', 'goofy', 'weird', 'versions', 'popular', 'songs', 'example', 'Kermit', 'inchworm', 'out', 'be', 'tip', 'tail', 'huge', 'monster', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'also', 'produced', 'brilliant', 'Muppet-based', 'commercials', 'local', 'businesses', 'can', 'see', 'YouTube', 'are', 'startlingly', 'violent', 'downright', 'nasty', 'even', 'modern', 'standards', 'Mickey', 'Mouse', 'cartoons', 'Muppets', 'were', 'never', 'intended', 'kiddie', 'entertainment', 'Americans', 'taste', 'entertainment', 'virtually', 'non-existent', 'associate', 'puppets', 'animated', 'films', 'children', 'combined', 'success', 'Muppets', 'part', 'Sesame', 'Street', '//failure//', 'SNL', 'cemented', 'view', 'Muppets', 'existed', 'provide', 'cute', 'family-safe', 'entertainment.Since', 'then', 'Muppets', 'have', 'done', 'nothing', 'least-bit', 'subversive', 'other', 'Sam', 'Eagle', 'who', 'obvious', 'poke', 'conservatives', 'Worse', 'almost', 'everything', 'do', 'shallow', 'show-biz', 'vein', 'Muppets', 'rehash', 'first', 'film', 'when', 'try', 'break', 'show', 'business', 'Only', '/this/', 'version', 'suffused', 'maudlin', 'sentimentality', 'worse', ""n't"", 'say', 'Muppets', ""n't"", 'have', 'very', 'funny', 'moments', 'particularly', 'liked', 'slap', 'Universal', 'Orlando', 'Brian', 'Henson', 'et', 'al', 'need', 'find', 'way', 'make', 'Muppets', 'appealing', 'intelligent', 'adult', 'audience', 'Muppets', 'Take', 'South', 'Park', 'perhaps', 'PS', 'Note', 'Walter', 'discovering', 'attraction', 'Muppets', 'can', 'be', 'interpreted', 'metaphor', 'something', 'else', '.PPS', 'Last', 'night', 'saw', 'few', 'minutes', 'Disney', 'Country', 'Bears', 'surprise', 'films', 'share', 'same', 'plot', 'elements', ""'m"", 'not', 'rest', 'family', ""'ve"", 'got', 'save', 'theater']",The Muppets

I also watched the movies as well and they were good too!  When I saw this movie was going to come out I was very glad to go see it.It was great in theaters and on DVD it was just as good!  The jokes were great and all my obscure favorites were there!  Statler and Waldorf, Sam the Legal Eagle, and Gonzo.I loved the in-jokes, the songs, the dancing, the cameos made by today's celebrities, and even when they constantly broke the 4th wall I couldn't stop laughing!  The introduction of Walter was good and Jason Segle did an amazing job with this movie!I also loved how they made the Muppets more modern.  Miss Piggy's hair became a modern straight style instead of her usual curls, and she was shaplier the way a modern woman is.The ending as great too, I was hoping to see the Manamana again and we did!
