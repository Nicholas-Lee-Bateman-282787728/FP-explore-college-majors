If one focuses on the hero, then the movie is a terrible waste.  But if one focuses on the female characters, then the movie takes on a completely different tone.The Good:* Special effects, most of them very colorful and appropriate.* The music is moving and powerful* The introduction of the movie retells human history, and the ending wraps the story up in a similarly ambitious way.The Bad:* A few of the effects are overdone and some are inappropriate.  For example, gigantic explosions are scaled-down and placed into a firefight.* The same music is repeatedly used and begins to lose its impact.* The story is essentially that of Battlestar Galactica (old or new series), so it is not original.* Many of the scenes involve sophmoric dialogue and humor that are uncomfortable to watch.The Interesting:* The hero is immature, crude, and has no redeeming qualities.  Every other character has more charm than he does.  And this is what makes the movie different; he is intentionally scripted as an unsympatheic, immature character.* The hero is analogous to the Christ of the Christian New Testament.* The female characters are the actual heroines of the story.

It has a nearly incomprehensible plot, what little there is of it, about a future where there are constructs, neanderthals, nephilim, and biobots, robots, and regular humans.  There is some war or something, and some groups fighting other groups.  The story seems to revolve around a ship called the Blue Whale, or something like that, which looks a lot like a WW2 German Uboat on steroids.There are space ships, gun fights, bombs, and explosions, all done is very poor special effects and with almost no meaning at all to what is happening.  There also is a sperm carrying teddy bear.  I kid you not.The acting is very bad, but the script is worse.  The extremely long and boring intro to the movie goes through some ""lost history"" of humanity.  It is so convoluted and bizarre that it is not easily followed.The characters are uneven and some suddenly change attitudes and styles right in the middle of the movie, without any explanation??!??

1263940,A3CNGVESY19NAU,B002DQL364,MovieGeekFeed.com,"[4, 5]","Have you ever watched a movie and said to yourself ""This is like a Frankenstein's monster of a film""? What I mean by that is you're watching the movie and it is painfully obvious that all the writer or director or whoever did was take different parts of other movies and put them in his own. That's basically what you get with Humanity's End.The movie was actually a lot more intelligent than your run of the mill SyFy Channel Saturday Night fodder. It had a story that at least attempted to be a bit more original than everything else out there, but it's handicap of basing elements on other films really does affect it in the end. The lead character is basically a caricature of Han Solo. He's got the swagger, the sarcasm, the blatant disregard of the ""rules"", and any other personality traits you can think of the captain of the Millennium Falcon having. The bad guys look like cheap versions of the Borg from Star Trek - literally to the T.The special effects have this weird kind of Chronicles of Riddick meets Mutant Chronicles meets Sin City CGI thing going on. It actually kind of looks cool and not as goofy as a lot of straight-to-DVD effects. The scenery is definitely pretty clean. Even the insides of the ships don't look like they were shot in a rented storage unit that they just kept moving the props around in to make it look like a different set.The beginning voiceover and synopsis of what has happened up until the movie starts is a bit long-winded and annoying, but I really did have to give them props for trying to make this film epic and, like I said before, not just some straight-up copycat sci-fi drivel. Even the music was more sophisticated. It was actually symphonic and emotional versus the typical techno or beat driven synth soundtrack you get accompanying these types of films.I can't really recall every movie this brought to mind as I watched it, but I can tell you that if you do see it, you to will get that feeling of deja vu. Humanity's End is an entertaining, humorous, and somewhat serious attempt at doing something original in the science fiction genre.

1263942,APPG3AAIJLF1,B002DQL364,Stokie Dave,"[19, 23]","Considering this had a low-budget of just $2m ($3m if you add the marketing) it's a remarkably cohesive and fun film. Certainly the best indie SF B-movie I've seen since Immortal - and I daresay people will have similarly mixed reactions to it.  These days we're all dazzled by the gloss and audience-measured plotlines of $50m epics, I suspect, and so we gripe when we see some indie grit. But if you can get past that, there's a decent entertainment to be had here. Overall the film feels rather like a long episode of Firefly, only with a 'reveal' that the Reavers were just bluffing and are actually the long-time immortal overlords of humanity rather than space brigands. But Humanity's End sprinkles that Firefly mix with the humanised-robots from Battlestar Galactica, and a few small touches of Star Wars (not much, just a Han Solo-alike, and some Scout Walker-alikes). The introduction to the film, narrating the history of humanity for seven minutes, has a rather poor choice of stock images and an annoying narrator - I would have thought any budding fantasy artist would have been happy to apply their skills here at little cost.  But after the introduction, there's a lot to like.  Except in a few explosions and laser-fire, the world of the film looks believable. The plot is a little stretched at times, especially towards the end, and I would have thought a little more SF inventiveness could have added a few subtle twists and thus avoided some illogicality. And the films threatens to bog down a little in the middle with an appropriately SF love-triangle, but the acting manages to keep it afloat.  The acting throughout is convincing, and I can't understand other reviews that moan that the acting is very poor. So, some of the baddies are hamming it up - but it comes with the territory. The dialogue might have been snappier, but the writers seem to have taken useful tips from Joss Whedon, and they're obviously trying their best. My test of a solid SF B-movie is - would I watch it again. I'd watch Humanity's End again, and happily.  I'm not sure I'd watch it a third time, though.",3,"If you liked Firefly, and a can accept this is a $2m indie, you'll like it",1251676800,"08 31, 2009",2009,2106,"['Considering', 'had', 'low-budget', 'just', '2m', '3m', 'add', 'marketing', 'remarkably', 'cohesive', 'fun', 'film', 'Certainly', 'best', 'indie', 'SF', 'B-movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Immortal', 'daresay', 'people', 'will', 'have', 'similarly', 'mixed', 'reactions', 'days', ""'re"", 'dazzled', 'gloss', 'audience-measured', 'plotlines', '50m', 'epics', 'suspect', 'so', 'gripe', 'when', 'see', 'indie', 'grit', 'can', 'get', 'past', 'decent', 'entertainment', 'be', 'had', 'here', 'Overall', 'film', 'feels', 'rather', 'long', 'episode', 'Firefly', 'only', ""'reveal"", 'Reavers', 'were', 'just', 'bluffing', 'are', 'actually', 'long-time', 'immortal', 'overlords', 'humanity', 'rather', 'space', 'brigands', 'Humanity', 'End', 'Firefly', 'mix', 'humanised-robots', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'few', 'small', 'touches', 'Star', 'Wars', 'not', 'much', 'just', 'Han', 'Solo-alike', 'Scout', 'Walker-alikes', 'introduction', 'film', 'narrating', 'history', 'humanity', 'seven', 'minutes', 'rather', 'poor', 'choice', 'stock', 'images', 'annoying', 'narrator', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'budding', 'fantasy', 'artist', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'happy', 'apply', 'skills', 'here', 'little', 'cost', 'introduction', 'lot', 'like', 'few', 'explosions', 'laser-fire', 'world', 'film', 'believable', 'plot', 'little', 'stretched', 'times', 'especially', 'end', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'little', 'more', 'SF', 'inventiveness', 'could', 'have', 'added', 'few', 'subtle', 'twists', 'thus', 'avoided', 'illogicality', 'films', 'bog', 'down', 'little', 'middle', 'appropriately', 'SF', 'love-triangle', 'acting', 'keep', 'afloat', 'acting', 'convincing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'other', 'reviews', 'moan', 'acting', 'very', 'poor', 'So', 'baddies', 'are', 'hamming', 'up', 'territory', 'dialogue', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'snappier', 'writers', 'seem', 'have', 'taken', 'useful', 'tips', 'Joss', 'Whedon', ""'re"", 'obviously', 'trying', 'best', 'test', 'solid', 'SF', 'B-movie', 'would', 'watch', 'again', ""'d"", 'watch', 'Humanity', 'End', 'again', 'happily', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', ""'d"", 'watch', 'third', 'time', 'though']",Humanity's End
