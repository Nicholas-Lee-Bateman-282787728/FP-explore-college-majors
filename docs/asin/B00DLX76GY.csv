Schneider,"[5, 5]","Ok, I will have to admit, though a daily exerciser I do have to &#34;like&#34; what I'm doing in order to keep at it and make it a part of my routine.  After losing 40#'s 9 years ago, the big &#34;take away&#34; was I won't do what I don't like, no matter how awesome it makes you look/feel, etc.Tracy's precision toning workout falls in this category for me.  Likes:  effective, yes, I do feel all of the parts I worked on today-today I did the butt and abs (Yesterday was arms and legs) + a ten minute all over toning routine from another dvd.  So effective?  Yes!  Here is where I come into an issue.....leg lifts etc, that seemingly go on forever, counting up to 40 repetitions.....don't people in hell do this?  Yeah, I was not a fan.  It was very cut and dried and I just am not motivated enough by looking at how awesome she looks at 40 to add this into my rotation.  I prefer exercise that is more &#34;fun&#34; which for me is anything dance oriented, kickboxing or yoga with the occasional pilates thrown in for good measure.  The seemingly endless repetitions just were too much for me.On an off topic, what is with the workout pants....I'm working out thinking &#34;Is Tracy really wearing pants that say &#34;I Love Tracy&#34;&#34;.....sorry, weird and also very distracting.So, I would have to say from an exercise standpoint if you do not mind repetition, this is definitely effective.  If you need more to inspire you, this probably is not it.  Fun factor on this one is a 0 out 5, effectiveness is a 4 out of 5.  Overall, I would not purchase this video, and after borrowing it once I don't plan to borrow it again.  There are too many dvd's that I truly enjoy that also give me great results.  As far as cuing and good technique she gets an A, but still, not enough for me to actually want to do this again or purchase it.",2,"effective, but the most boring routine on earth....",1397606400,"04 16, 2014",2014,1840,"['Ok', 'will', 'have', 'admit', 'daily', 'exerciser', 'do', 'have', '34', '34', 'what', ""'m"", 'doing', 'order', 'keep', 'make', 'part', 'routine', 'losing', '40', '9', 'years', 'ago', 'big', '34', 'take', 'away', '34', 'was', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'matter', 'how', 'awesome', 'look/feel', 'etc.Tracy', 'precision', 'toning', 'workout', 'category', 'Likes', 'effective', 'yes', 'do', 'feel', 'parts', 'worked', 'today-today', 'did', 'butt', 'abs', 'Yesterday', 'was', 'arms', 'legs', '+', 'ten', 'minute', 'toning', 'routine', 'dvd', 'So', 'effective', 'Yes', 'Here', 'where', 'come', 'issue', '..leg', 'lifts', 'etc', 'seemingly', 'go', 'forever', 'counting', 'up', '40', 'repetitions', '..do', ""n't"", 'people', 'hell', 'do', 'Yeah', 'was', 'not', 'fan', 'was', 'very', 'cut', 'dried', 'just', 'am', 'not', 'motivated', 'enough', 'looking', 'how', 'awesome', '40', 'add', 'rotation', 'prefer', 'exercise', 'more', '34', 'fun', '34', 'anything', 'dance', 'oriented', 'kickboxing', 'yoga', 'occasional', 'pilates', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure', 'seemingly', 'endless', 'repetitions', 'just', 'were', 'too', 'much', 'me.On', 'off', 'topic', 'what', 'workout', 'pants', '.I', ""'m"", 'working', 'out', 'thinking', '34', 'Tracy', 'really', 'wearing', 'pants', 'say', '34', 'Love', 'Tracy', '34', '34', '..sorry', 'weird', 'also', 'very', 'distracting.So', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'exercise', 'standpoint', 'do', 'not', 'mind', 'repetition', 'definitely', 'effective', 'need', 'more', 'inspire', 'probably', 'not', 'Fun', 'factor', 'one', '0', '5', 'effectiveness', '4', '5', 'Overall', 'would', 'not', 'purchase', 'video', 'borrowing', 'once', 'do', ""n't"", 'plan', 'borrow', 'again', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'dvd', 'truly', 'enjoy', 'also', 'give', 'great', 'results', 'As', 'far', 'cuing', 'good', 'technique', 'A', 'still', 'not', 'enough', 'actually', 'want', 'do', 'again', 'purchase']",Tracy Anderson: Precision Toning

You can choose to do just one segment, or you can play all of them together, for a 60-minute workout.To do the workout you'll need the following equipment:*  a yoga mat*  a pair of 3-pound and 5-pound dumbbells*  a chair*  ankle weights (optional)If you're new to Tracy Anderson, I would definitely get this and/or her newMethod for Beginnersworkouts before jumping into her other programs.  In these two new workouts, Tracy takes more time to explain proper form and she cues much more than she does in her older ones.  She even counts the reps on this one, and explains all of the various angles that she uses to target your legs and arms.  In fact, this would be a great one to get and do a few times before doing one of the Metamorphosis sets since she explains the positioning of your body so much better.The music was a disappointment since some of it (in the legs segment) is from Metamorphosis, and I've heard it so often that it made me a little insane!  :-)  I love the music on her Mat and dance cardio workouts, and had been hoping for similar music on this one since she has such great taste in that area!Tracy's method is very different, and I've had mixed results with it.  (I've posted lengthy reviews of my experiences withTracy Anderson's Metamorphosis - GlutecentricandTracy Anderson's Metamorphosis - Hipcentricin those links.)Because of my experiences, I'm not sure if I would do an entire TA rotation again, but I really like mixing in her workouts with other instructors, and I've found the arms segment on Mat to be one of the best arm workouts I have.  The arms segment on this new DVD is equally good.  (On Facebook recently, someone in a fitness group I belong to posted her results from doing 30 days in a row of just TA Mat arms, and her arms looked amazing!  Now that I have this second DVD, I might try alternating the two segments to see if I can get similar results.)Overall, this is a good workout to start with if you're curious about trying Tracy Anderson's muscular structure work or if you want to add something new from her into the mix.

You can mix and match, but they're really designed to be done together as the warm up is included in the arms workout. The contents of each workout are quite similar to her Mat dvd from the Tracy Anderson Method, but there are enough variations to make buying this DVD worthwhile. The arms section is quite fast-paced, and has the addition of 5 pound weights. This is pretty weird in some ways as Tracy used to be so insistent that women never use more than 3 pound weights. EVER. She doesn't explain this sudden change in her beliefs, but whatever. Your arms get an amazing workout.The thigh and butt workouts are extremely challenging. In the thigh workout, you rely on a chair for balance the whole time as you do 25 reps of every move. Your leg muscles are completely exhausted by the end. The butt workout is on the floor, on all fours. Tracy's thinking is that if she exhausts your leg muscles in the thigh routine, by the time you do the butt the correct muscles will switch on. This is probably true, but you can really feel your legs screaming the whole way through the butt section. Your glutes also burn so much as you do 40 reps of every move. It's extremely sweaty work, and you pant the whole way through. Great workout.The abs section is also very difficult with lots of small range of motion sit-ups and leg raises. You also do plank twists which are super challenging.Highly recommended DVD for anyone who wants to get super toned and lean.
