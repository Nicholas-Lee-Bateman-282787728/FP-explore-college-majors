With the U.S. version of the DVD's though, don't get your hopes up when it comes to any extras because there aren't any.  The discs are about as plain as they come.  So as long as you aren't expecting anything other than the show itself, you won't be disappointed.  The picture quality is the same as when it first aired on television.  Other than that, the DVD's came out fine, just check to make sure nothing is wrong with the discs as some of them tend to shift during shipping.I have heard that if you can afford it, get another country's version of the sets, such as the Canadian version, because it has better picture quality and it actually has extras on the DVD's.

I'd ignore the debate regarding the new Ray and the old Ray because the good news is that doesn't really matter as the shows are still fun and make for a light, happy and engaging viewing experience.  In the end, the character change works out fine anyhow.Although the first couple shows or so started a little slow for me, Season 3 picked up steam as it continued and got better and better as we all rolled along.  I hated to see ""Due South"" end because I so enjoyed the characters, especially Frazier's boss, when she let loose. In Season 3, all the characters were starting to develop more and have more air time, which created a more varied and interesting aspect to the series. Good for the whole family to enjoy together.

789916,A3PJQ4742VN84H,B0000YWKFO,"Hope this helps ""help""","[0, 0]","For me, &#34;Due South&#34; is definitely a show that carries a lot of nostalgic weight.  I remember seeing the show a long long time ago without ever knowing the title...only to suddenly remember its existence and find out it's name this year.  It really was my first &#34;crime drama&#34;.  Seeing it year later, the show still has a certain charm and appeal...while being quite refreshing in the rareness of it's themes, today.CONTENT ISSUES:  Well, by today's standards, the show is very &#34;family friendly&#34; and clean...BUT not without qualifiers.  Sometimes the characters do cuss (though it does not go much further than &#34;D****** t&#34;).  There really isn't much innuendo and such, but sometimes when they depict some criminals, at times there are cases like when there is, shall we say, a &#34;woman-for-hire&#34; wrapped in a blanket in the background to further accentuate the criminal archetype of that episode's antagonist.  But honestly, it's still quite tame.PLOT (ABSOLUTELY NO SPOILERS):Well, for one thing, this Canadian production earns major props for having a Mountie as one of the main protagonists of the show.  It's not often that we get televised depictions of them.  But beyond that aspect, this show carries a wonderful blend of both real-life-down-to-earth Cop show, to smile-inducing comedies, to straight up serious dramatic moments.  To top it all off, it wonderfully adds a touch of fantasy (that works ironically well, especially considering a lot of the show takes place in the depths of Chicago).  The show certainly has an immense sense of variety...though of course it ultimately comes down (most of the time) to apprehending the episode's criminal.  It is largely episodic by nature (meaning episodes can stand alone), but they do well to reference events from past episodes...and at times have an overarching direction.  The character chemistry is also an experience in of itself since each of the actors really defines their respective characters quite well.VIDEO:The video quality is not bad...but it really carries the visual quality it had during the 90s (more specifically: the best video quality you could have had during that decade).  It doesn't bother me and I find the video to still be quite clear, but for some that is worth noting.SOUND:It's good.  It's decent.  I have no problems with it.PACKAGING:All 26-episodes are found on three discs.  The case is a standard sized plastic DVD case (cheaper plastic, it seems), with the discs stored in flip book fashion.  This next part is the one reason I knocked off a star: You CANNOT select individual episodes from the menu.  Rather, they are generally grouped in threes.  For example, Disc 1 has nine episodes...but those episodes are divided into 3 groups (ex. Group A: ep 1-3; Group B: ep. 4-6, Group C: ep.7-9).  You select the group.  I honestly can't fathom the reasoning for this when most others allow you to select individual episodes...but at least it just takes 2 or 3 (I forget) chapter-forwards to move to the next episode.  Also, just to note, the episodes are around 45 minutes each.This is definitely a gem of a show.  The wonderful character chemistry.  Also, the seamless blending of themes and multiple genres (comedy, drama, fantasy, etc.) is truly astounding.  And especially the way that Fraser and Ray both compliment and contrast each other is a great conversation starter.  &#34;Due South&#34; maybe underrated...but it can be a thrilling and thought provoking ride to those who find it.",4,A fun 26 episode romp through the Chicago Wilderness,1392249600,"02 13, 2014",2014,3519,"['34', 'Due', 'South', '34', 'definitely', 'show', 'lot', 'nostalgic', 'weight', 'remember', 'seeing', 'show', 'long', 'long', 'time', 'ever', 'knowing', 'title', 'only', 'suddenly', 'remember', 'existence', 'find', 'name', 'year', 'really', 'was', 'first', '34', 'crime', 'drama', '34', 'Seeing', 'year', 'later', 'show', 'still', 'certain', 'charm', 'appeal', 'being', 'quite', 'refreshing', 'rareness', 'themes', 'today.CONTENT', 'ISSUES', 'Well', 'today', 'standards', 'show', 'very', '34', 'family', 'friendly', '34', 'clean', 'BUT', 'not', 'qualifiers', 'Sometimes', 'characters', 'do', 'cuss', 'not', 'go', 'much', 'further', '34', 'D******', 't', '34', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'innuendo', 'such', 'sometimes', 'when', 'depict', 'criminals', 'times', 'are', 'cases', 'when', 'shall', 'say', '34', 'woman-for-hire', '34', 'wrapped', 'blanket', 'background', 'further', 'accentuate', 'criminal', 'archetype', 'episode', 'antagonist', 'honestly', 'still', 'quite', 'tame.PLOT', 'ABSOLUTELY', 'NO', 'SPOILERS', 'Well', 'one', 'thing', 'Canadian', 'production', 'major', 'props', 'having', 'Mountie', 'one', 'main', 'protagonists', 'show', 'not', 'often', 'get', 'televised', 'depictions', 'aspect', 'show', 'wonderful', 'blend', 'real-life-down-to-earth', 'Cop', 'show', 'smile-inducing', 'comedies', 'straight', 'up', 'serious', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'top', 'off', 'wonderfully', 'touch', 'fantasy', 'ironically', 'well', 'especially', 'considering', 'lot', 'show', 'place', 'depths', 'Chicago', 'show', 'certainly', 'immense', 'sense', 'variety', 'course', 'ultimately', 'down', 'most', 'time', 'apprehending', 'episode', 'criminal', 'largely', 'episodic', 'nature', 'meaning', 'episodes', 'can', 'stand', 'alone', 'do', 'well', 'reference', 'events', 'past', 'episodes', 'times', 'have', 'overarching', 'direction', 'character', 'chemistry', 'also', 'experience', 'actors', 'really', 'defines', 'respective', 'characters', 'quite', 'well.VIDEO', 'video', 'quality', 'not', 'bad', 'really', 'visual', 'quality', 'had', '90s', 'more', 'specifically', 'best', 'video', 'quality', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'decade', ""n't"", 'bother', 'find', 'video', 'still', 'be', 'quite', 'clear', 'worth', 'noting.SOUND', 'good', 'decent', 'have', 'problems', 'it.PACKAGING', '26-episodes', 'are', 'found', 'three', 'discs', 'case', 'standard', 'sized', 'plastic', 'DVD', 'case', 'cheaper', 'plastic', 'discs', 'stored', 'flip', 'book', 'fashion', 'next', 'part', 'one', 'reason', 'knocked', 'off', 'star', 'CAN', 'NOT', 'select', 'individual', 'episodes', 'menu', 'are', 'generally', 'grouped', 'threes', 'example', 'Disc', '1', 'nine', 'episodes', 'episodes', 'are', 'divided', '3', 'groups', 'ex', 'Group', 'ep', '1-3', 'Group', 'B', 'ep', '4-6', 'Group', 'C', 'ep.7-9', 'select', 'group', 'honestly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fathom', 'reasoning', 'when', 'most', 'others', 'allow', 'select', 'individual', 'episodes', 'least', 'just', '2', '3', 'forget', 'chapter-forwards', 'move', 'next', 'episode', 'Also', 'just', 'note', 'episodes', 'are', '45', 'minutes', 'each.This', 'definitely', 'gem', 'show', 'wonderful', 'character', 'chemistry', 'Also', 'seamless', 'blending', 'themes', 'multiple', 'genres', 'comedy', 'drama', 'fantasy', 'etc', 'truly', 'astounding', 'especially', 'way', 'Fraser', 'Ray', 'compliment', 'contrast', 'other', 'great', 'conversation', 'starter', '34', 'Due', 'South', '34', 'maybe', 'underrated', 'can', 'be', 'thrilling', 'thought', 'provoking', 'ride', 'who', 'find']",DUE SOUTH - SEASON 3

It's a drama with lots of comedy about a mounty coming to the city... Season three was probably not the best of the three/four but once you get hooked to the characters/story you have to watch it through to the end. You have to be careful when you are buying the episodes because there are two or three versions of the seasons. Some versions divide it up into only three seasons, some four, and some include the mini movie special on a separate disc and others count it as a normal episode. As long as you get the discs from the same release you should end up with every show. The last season is a bit chaotic because they thought they were being cancelled and even tore down some of the set already, also Ray is replaced with an ""imposter"" for most of the season (which they explain). ""Ride forever"" is my favorite (a two parter) but there are several outstanding episodes in there. Benton and Dieff are so easy to love, and all the supporting characters do a great job  - especially ray and franchesca. The music is really well done as well.

789927,ARI2C0G2PPBO,B0000YWKFO,RENS,"[12, 12]","I am at a loss to understand the confusions and quibbles of some of the reviewers of this final set of Due South CDs.  Paul Gross's portrayal of Benton Frazer is more refined than ever, and his new partner, Ray Kowalski, is played by Callum Keith Rennie to perfection.  Like Gross, Rennie is a master actor.  The two of them clearly formed a close bond making these episodes.  Their relationship as Benton and Ray undergoes a series of transformations right to the close of the final episode, perhaps one of the most open and perplexing and hopeful and beautiful closing episodes of any series, matched perhaps by the final episode of Six Feet Under in which quite the opposite occurs and every character's destiny is made perfectly clear.The shifting from the first Ray to the second was a situational, contractural necessity.  The writers brilliantly turned it into a splendid plot twist, confusing Benton Frazer and the viewer quiet thoroughly for most of the first episode of the season - and then resolving the mystery as both silly and sinister and letting us get on with the season.I commend to all who read this the other tv series and films in which either Paul Gross or Callum Keith Rennie appear.  Most of them are good films, and Gross and Rennie can even make the Grade B ones shine with their acting.  Happily, most of them are currently available.  Just search on Paul Gross or Callum Keith Rennie.Canada has a thriving, first-rate film ""industry.""  We in the United States tend to remain ignorant of the great Canadian directors (such as Denis Arcand), writers (such as Paul Haggis) and actors (such as those in Due South and Slings and Arrows). Yes, you too, Draco, the masterful, hunky-husky canine actor who played Diefenbaker with a wolfy woof.Maybe that's why the DVDs sell so inexpensively - their value is underrated to begin with.  Our loss if we ignore them; our great delight if we get to know them.My Canadian brothers and sisters:  I thank you very kindly.Writing this review reminds me of the time when, making our way north of Vancouver, my partner and I were on the track of - well, a story for another occasion.",5,The superb final season of Due South!

789929,A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB,B0000YWKFO,"Sarah ""Eat Dessert First""","[36, 43]","I found out about the domestic release of Due South on Amazon.com, and rushed out to buy all three seasons. The Canadian box sets are $80 Canadian, so buying all four seasons from Canada is an expensive proposition. The American release costs a third of that, and contains the pilot to boot, which wasn't included until the Season 3 box set in Canada.Due South followed the misguided adventures of Benton Fraser, a constable in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, as he tracked his father's killers to Chicago. After closing the case, his Canadian superiors advised him to lie low, so he remains in Chicago as a liaison at the Canadian consulate and works cases with Ray Vecchio, Chicago cop, along with his deaf wolf Diefenbaker (named after a former Canadian Prime Minister). The Canadian/American and wilderness/city culture clash leads to some humorous moments along the way.The picture quality is noticeably grainy since it was taken from videotape rather than the masters, but for the great price (I now have all the seasons for less than one season of the Canadian box set), it's a compromise that was worth it. Like the Canadian set, there are no extras, also no closed captioning. Menus are bare bones and include episodes and chapter menus (hardly ""interactive"" menus as stated on the box). The packaging is a big step from the clunky Canadian design, featuring an attractive foldout cardboard case with large photos of Ray, Benton, and Dief.The DVDs are single sided, meaning easier handling. All 26 third season episodes are here, including the two part ""Mountie on the Bounty"" and two part series finale ""Call of the Wild."" Nicknamed ""The show that would not die,"" Due South was resurrected from the dead for the third season, when they were already destroying sets and many of the original cast had other work. David Marciano (Ray) was replaced by Canadian tough guy Callum Keith Rennie from Hard Core Logo. Marciano's absence was explained by having him on an undercover drug bust in Mexico, and Callum was a stand-in as Ray. Paul Gross took on the triple hats of actor, director, and producer, as well as doing most of his own stunts. And the show took a much darker, gritter, sexually charged tone in its final reincarnation. Citing reading Due South slash fiction (homoerotic fan fiction), Gross included elements (real or implied, your call) of homoerotic tension between Kowalski and Fraser, more violence, explicit songs on the soundtrack, and a less family friendly tone in general. My greatest disappointment was with the series finale, in which the storylines are wrapped up in an improbable, flippant way that insulted fans of the first two seasons. Et tu, Benton?Hardcore fans will want the third season (originally split into two seasons in the US), but the best episodes are in the first two seasons with the ""real"" Ray. And what's up with the packaging? All the box art shows David Marciano instead of Callum Keith Rennie--not a major gripe, but inaccurate to say the least.",3,"Three stars for content, three for video quality...and what's up with the packaging?
