987516,A33L7G4E8CID3,B000FBH3WW,"Adam Dukovich ""colts_19""","[55, 60]","The 1990s were a notoriously bad decade for sitcoms. Hundreds of Seinfeld- and Wayans-wannabes flooded the airwaves and, in general, aside from Seinfeld and Sports Night, few had any originality or staying power. NewsRadio is a glorious exception, a bright and occasionally very biting comedy about the workplace which is kindred to Mary Tyler Moore and Newhart more so than to Just Shoot Me. NewsRadio's laughs came from brilliant observations, recurring gags, well-defined characters and logical but wacky plotlines. It was close in vein to Seinfeld's unsentimentality, but far more vicious: one example is in season 3's Daydream episode, for those who saw it, has all the characters experiencing revealing daydreams. It features a vendor whose dream is to be one of the ""gang"" at WNYX, but as it turns out is hardly known and barely tolerated. NewsRadio invests more in its characters than do most dramas, and never settles for the half-assed laugh-track banality of its contemporaries. This is why it developed such a following, even if it was a very small percentage of the population.The fourth season of NewsRadio is once again a triumph. With every season, the show kept building upon itself and getting better. There were notable guest appearances: Jon Lovitz has another guest appearance, this time as a suicide jumper exactly one year before joining the cast. Additionally, a pre-Gilmore Girls Lauren Graham begins a stint in this season as an efficiency expert. There were some departures as well: first, Khandi Alexander left the show, despite the fact that her initially poorly-written character had improved a great deal; and, of course, Phil Hartman was murdered by his wife after this season. The knowledge of this invariably tints the experience of watching this season. Nevertheless, these episodes show Hartman at his imperious best: taking over the office (in Who's the Boss?), getting a butler (in The Secret of Management), and becoming a Bob Roberts-type performer (in The Public Domain). Other highlights: Matthew (Andy Dick) gets fired, Dave (Dave Foley) and Lisa (Maura Tierney) split again and then switch jobs, and then switch again. This doesn't stop Lisa from trying to pick the brain of the station's owner, Mr. James (Stephen Root), with hilarious results. I could go on, but ultimately, this is a sitcom that is better enjoyed the less you know going in. Even so, it rewards multiple viewings, which is surprising since many sitcoms don't even reward single viewings. With the release of this show on DVD, it will likely become more popular than ever, and hopefully take its rightful place in the pantheon of great comedy.",5,Another Superb Installment of NewsRadio,1146355200,"04 30, 2006",2006,2656,"['1990s', 'were', 'notoriously', 'bad', 'decade', 'sitcoms', 'Hundreds', 'Seinfeld-', 'Wayans-wannabes', 'flooded', 'airwaves', 'general', 'aside', 'Seinfeld', 'Sports', 'Night', 'few', 'had', 'originality', 'staying', 'power', 'NewsRadio', 'glorious', 'exception', 'bright', 'occasionally', 'very', 'biting', 'comedy', 'workplace', 'kindred', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'Newhart', 'more', 'so', 'Just', 'Shoot', 'Me', 'NewsRadio', 'laughs', 'came', 'brilliant', 'observations', 'recurring', 'gags', 'well-defined', 'characters', 'logical', 'wacky', 'plotlines', 'was', 'close', 'vein', 'Seinfeld', 'unsentimentality', 'far', 'more', 'vicious', 'one', 'example', 'season', '3', 'Daydream', 'episode', 'who', 'saw', 'characters', 'experiencing', 'revealing', 'daydreams', 'vendor', 'dream', 'be', 'one', 'gang', 'WNYX', 'out', 'hardly', 'known', 'barely', 'tolerated', 'NewsRadio', 'invests', 'more', 'characters', 'do', 'most', 'dramas', 'never', 'settles', 'half-assed', 'laugh-track', 'banality', 'contemporaries', 'why', 'developed', 'following', 'even', 'was', 'very', 'small', 'percentage', 'population.The', 'fourth', 'season', 'NewsRadio', 'once', 'again', 'triumph', 'season', 'show', 'kept', 'building', 'getting', 'better', 'were', 'notable', 'guest', 'appearances', 'Jon', 'Lovitz', 'guest', 'appearance', 'time', 'suicide', 'jumper', 'exactly', 'one', 'year', 'joining', 'cast', 'Additionally', 'pre-Gilmore', 'Girls', 'Lauren', 'Graham', 'stint', 'season', 'efficiency', 'expert', 'were', 'departures', 'well', 'first', 'Khandi', 'Alexander', 'left', 'show', 'fact', 'initially', 'poorly-written', 'character', 'had', 'improved', 'great', 'deal', 'course', 'Phil', 'Hartman', 'was', 'murdered', 'wife', 'season', 'knowledge', 'invariably', 'experience', 'watching', 'season', 'Nevertheless', 'episodes', 'show', 'Hartman', 'imperious', 'best', 'taking', 'office', 'Who', 'Boss', 'getting', 'butler', 'Secret', 'Management', 'becoming', 'Bob', 'Roberts-type', 'performer', 'Public', 'Domain', 'Other', 'highlights', 'Matthew', 'Andy', 'Dick', 'fired', 'Dave', 'Dave', 'Foley', 'Lisa', 'Maura', 'Tierney', 'split', 'again', 'then', 'switch', 'jobs', 'then', 'switch', 'again', ""n't"", 'stop', 'Lisa', 'trying', 'pick', 'brain', 'station', 'owner', 'Mr.', 'James', 'Stephen', 'Root', 'hilarious', 'results', 'could', 'go', 'ultimately', 'sitcom', 'better', 'enjoyed', 'less', 'know', 'going', 'Even', 'so', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'surprising', 'many', 'sitcoms', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'reward', 'single', 'viewings', 'release', 'show', 'DVD', 'will', 'likely', 'become', 'more', 'popular', 'ever', 'hopefully', 'take', 'rightful', 'place', 'pantheon', 'great', 'comedy']",Newsradio - The Complete Fourth Season
987517,A20IIR0422G3A5,B000FBH3WW,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[1, 1]","It is satisfying to read about the ""Newsradio"" fourth season, and to see many of one's hunches confirmed. The third season, which I really believed was better than the first two, was the lowest rated season of its five season run, and one can see in season 4 exactly the kind of changes, giving things I found missing in previous seasons. The most obvious is the addition of two to four episode arcs in the plot. The first was when an efficiency expert had Matthew (Andy Dick) fired to eliminate wasteful expenses. The second arc was when Lisa (Maura Tierney) replaced Dave (Dave Foley) as News Director. It may not be surprising if none of these arcs worked very well, since they were done at the urging of the network, against the wishes of the principle writers. None came even within shouting distance of the great arc in the relationship between Diane and Sam on ""Cheers"", which had us going for the better part of two seasons, with enough bumps in the road to make the genuine attraction between the two that much more engaging. I suggest the writers knew what they were doing, since the most memorable episodes were ""standalone"", such as episode 17 ""Balloon"" and ""President"", episode 1 of season 3, both highlighting Jimmy James (Stephen Root). The last episode, of which I will avoid giving away any spoilers, was possibly a classic example of what has been described as ""jumping the shark"", where a series is in trouble, and it tries something gimmicky to recoup viewers. One thing from which the show did not recover is the loss of Khandi Alexander, about a third of the way through the season. She never played a big role, but her character was a great contrast to the assortment of misfits and inept managers.That loss removed the basis for about four or five good lines per episode.Unlike some other reviewers, I believe the show was very good, but not great, in the same class as other ensemble cast comedies such as ""Taxi"", ""Cheers"", ""Frazier"", ""Seinfeld"", and ""Friends"". It seems as if it delivered all it best stuff early, and it never made good use of the characters of Joe, Beth, and Catherine. But then, its differences are what make it so much fun to watch, especially with the relatively low price of the complete season sets.",5,Changes from third season don't add.

The cast goes PERFECTLY together and it is hard to find a show without any serious faults.  It is a seriously star studded cast and that is maybe where they went wrong though none of the original members ever brought down the show.  Lauren Graham ended up beign a great edition where Matthew gets fired though becomes maybe an even bigger part of the show.  Doesn't make sense, well Newsradio is pretty unique.  When Lauren finished her 6 episodes it was most likely the executives at NBC who decided they needed another cast member.  This and having Jon Lovitz for Season 5 are really the only things in the show that never made sense to me.  Everybody on the show had their 'thing'.  Matthew's and Bill are cray, though in different ways, Joe and Beth are stupid, Catherine hates Bill and acts like she hates Joe, Lauren Graham was really weird and scary at times...  But they never really came up with anything for the new guy.  I guess he is just something to look at for the ladies.The commentaries are going to give you a lot of good insight on what was going on with the executives of NBC but overall they are pretty boring.  I honestly found all of the commentaries boring from season 1 to 4 but still worth a watch if you have nothing better to do.  Literally no actors are on the commentaries for this season except one I think.  They call them on the phone a couple times but it would have been nice to have at least one commentary with Joe Rogan or Khandi Alexander.  The gag reel is great.  Kind of dissapointing there are only 22 episodes since season 3 had 25 episodes and way more special features.
