733312,A2JUR4XQAHSXT6,B0000844IC,Amazon Customer,"[23, 46]","This film is horribly depressing.  The main actor plays his character like a raving lunatic and , if he acted this way in public, would have been locked up.I was hoping this DVD would be a series of shorts, like arabian nights, or even the 10th kingdom, but no.  Instead it was a thinly disguised biography of han's christian anderson.  In fact the acting of the main character is so bad, you do not even want to see the fairy tales.  They too are gloomy and depressive.Skip this one, and if you must get a hall mark faerie tale try the following:10th KingdomArabian nightsThe Snow QueenDinotopiaJack and the Bean Stalk the true storyMerlinIn that order.Sincerely:  David C.

To those who cherish Andersen and those have not been spoiled by this present world of in-your-face theatrics and slam-bang storytelling. All is not happy in this tale.

733317,AGRR05FH945HR,B0000844IC,Steven Cain,"[8, 8]","I take David Eberhart's point about the depressing quality that weaves its way though this movie - the front end, during his early years, being the most depressing by far.The almost Shakespearean tragedy of mis-placed affection and obsessive love that led Andersen to pursue the wrong woman is captured well, while various fairytales are woven into the real-life a story span.Bew is almost over the top as a wacky but gifted Andersen, although his craziness gradually diminishes as the movie progresses.Emily Hamilton gives a heartbreakingly sweet and sensitive performance as his 'adoptive' sister, whom any man in his right mind would have married in an instant.By the time Andersen works out that he really loved Emily's character after all, it is too late...When it works, it works beautifully, and the cast, which includes the superb James Fox and Alison Steadman (who turns in a couple of delicious cameos) all delivered admirable performances.Not perfect, but worth a look.",4,"Magical, but uneven film...",1157587200,"09 7, 2006",2006,980,"['take', 'David', 'Eberhart', 'point', 'depressing', 'quality', 'way', 'movie', 'front', 'end', 'early', 'years', 'being', 'most', 'depressing', 'far.The', 'almost', 'Shakespearean', 'tragedy', 'mis-placed', 'affection', 'obsessive', 'love', 'led', 'Andersen', 'pursue', 'wrong', 'woman', 'captured', 'well', 'various', 'fairytales', 'are', 'woven', 'real-life', 'story', 'span.Bew', 'almost', 'top', 'wacky', 'gifted', 'Andersen', 'craziness', 'gradually', 'movie', 'progresses.Emily', 'Hamilton', 'heartbreakingly', 'sweet', 'sensitive', 'performance', ""'adoptive"", 'sister', 'whom', 'man', 'right', 'mind', 'would', 'have', 'married', 'instant.By', 'time', 'Andersen', 'out', 'really', 'loved', 'Emily', 'character', 'too', 'late', 'When', 'beautifully', 'cast', 'superb', 'James', 'Fox', 'Alison', 'Steadman', 'who', 'couple', 'delicious', 'cameos', 'delivered', 'admirable', 'performances.Not', 'perfect', 'look']",Hans Christian Andersen - My Life as a Fairytale
