I also got my husband addicted to the show as well, so we now have all the seasons, except for 10, which we are anxiously awaiting its arrival!

Some of the episodes in this season seemed a little clunky or forced like the one where Frasier is haunted by his ex-wives' memories or the one where he attends a retirement party for Cliff of Cheers. However, there are some really good episodes too. I think part of the issue the show faced in seasons 8 and 9 was the partial resolution of the Daphne-Niles relationship and how that affected the story lines. However, the final scene of the final episode is a highly emotional and effective hook based on these two characters that makes you want to rush out and buy season 10.

1051678,ATP9LYGM6D3RO,B000MX7V5W,"McGillicutty ""DVD Fan""","[0, 1]","Following the erratic Season 8, Frasier bounded back strongly with a solid run of fine episodes for this, the 9th season of this great series. While not up to the prime days, this season still has some funny moments & fine performances.We begin with ""Don Juan in Hell"", featuring Lilith, Diane, Nannie G, & the return of Rita Wilson as Frasier's mother.  Despite the talent and interesting premise, the episode does languish at times.But ""Room Full of Heroes"" is a real winner and all the cast looking like they had a great time making it with Niles dressing up as Martin being the highlight.  Disc 2 features ""Bla-Z-Boy"" with the great visual of Martin and Daphne walking down the sidewalk only to have a certain beloved item drop from the sky.  Adam Arkin is Frasier's Number One fan in ""The Two Hundredth Episode"" and we have the welcome return of Bebe in ""Junior Agent"".Frasier also gets an arch ""enemy"" in the form of Cam Winston (now there's a name) in the two part ""Mother Load"" which also brings back the wonderful Anthony LaPaglia as Daphne's wayward brother Simon. Disc 3 features a nice turn by Michael Keaton in ""Wheels of Fortune"", though his identity as Lilith's half brother seems rather half baked. Sadly, ""War of the Words"" may be one of, if not the worst episode in the entire history of ""Frasier"".Disc 4 brings back some of the ""Cheers"" gang in ""Cheerful Goodbyes"" as the Crane clan return to Boston just in time for Cliff's retirement party. The final two episodes introduce us to Daphne's father played with much aplomb by Brian Cox. And while Daphne's parents have apparently parted ways for the final time, the episode ends with Daphne demanding the Niles marry her right now.Like previous seasons, this DVD has no extras but you can skip the previews and go straight to the main menu. The DVD case cover uses a rather odd purple color which is also seen on the menu screens. We get the usual official photos of the cast and the one of Roz on the Disc 2 menu screen is rather nice.This is another okay, but not exceptional effort on the part of CBS Video.  Where oh where are the extras or the bloopers? Even an extra menu screen showing the nominations and awards would've been nice.Tidbits:- Moose makes his return to the DVD spine in this edition.  So far, only Eddie `n Frasier's picture have been on the spine of the DVD case.- In a flashback sequence for ""The Return of Martin Crane"" we get to see Marty walk without a cane.-  One of the best character entries has to be Niles riding in on a Segway (it's even a photo on the DVD case).  Interestingly enough, he wears a hat very similar to one he wore in the Fifth Season's ""Bad Dog"".  In that episode, Frasier chides him about his choice of hats.- You probably know this, but in ""Cheerful Goodbyes"" the older gentleman playing Phil (not ""Al"" as he proclaims) is actually Rhea Pearlman's father.- When Daphne greets her father, he calls her ""Stilts"".

1051683,AHPCWHAKOVZXS,B000MX7V5W,"Peter Andronas ""Petros""","[0, 0]","Since season eight there has been a different direction to the series that steers away from its initial formula; it keeps digging deeper into psychiatry, the personal psychology and relationships of the characters. Season nine literally starts off where season eight left off with a two-part episode where he battles with his affections for Claire and his lust for Lana. And in a following episode, all his ex-wives, fianc&eacute;s and his Mother come to nest in his confused mind and try to answer the old-age Frasier question; why can't he hold a relationship with a woman? When Frasier tries to escape the self- inflicted analysis which he has manifested; he opens a door to escape and all the women from his past are waiting for him on the other side...yikes!!!In this classic season Roz finally starts dating the real thing after meeting Roger played by the charming and talented Tony Goldwyn whom Frasier describes as `a combination of gentility and brute strength'. In this relationship Roz learns to deal with her prejudices; you see Roger works for the city collecting garbage and that stinks according to her.Lana's son Kirby is still part of the scene and appears in a few episodes; watch Kirby organize Niles' library with cheese puffs on one hand and a soft drink on the other. Meanwhile Martin and Frasier are dealing with old demons as opposed to Daphne and Roz who are dealing with new demons as well as old ones; Daphne becomes jealous of a female patient being treated by Niles when she accidentally reads a confidential file and makes things worse when she spies on the woman; you've never seen Niles this upset with Daphne and you've never seen Daphne more disoriented than during her Mother and brother's visit; her Mother's comment to her brother `it's you who'll have your leg over any filth that moves' with his response `I don't care if they're moving'; is comedy heaven and her Mother's constant insults when she decides to roost in Seattle followed by Daphne giving her a piece of her mind is inspired while Simon's crude behaviour upset the Crane household in `Mother Load', topped off with Frasier throwing Simon out on the street with luggage intact!SPOILERS AHEAD!The icing on the cake is `The Proposal' which digs into the Crane's dirty laundry while Niles is preparing an engagement party for his proposal to Daphne; the scene where the three Cranes help Niles buy the ring ends up with Frasier on his knees, Niles wearing the ring and Martin shaking his head as he shuffles out of the jewellers. That scene is soon followed by a narrow emergency escape of musicians, chefs, waiters and angels from Niles home when the party has to be cancelled; which puts a new spin on TV comedy!The character is one of the most original on television and that's why it's been a successful series; watching this tormented man who needs to control everything, fall to pieces `like scrambled eggs, all over the place' in every episode has been a fun albeit frustrating ride; gee it almost resembles parts of my life...been there, done that!Bibi shows up for a short stint and only one scene with a new and very handsome client, Doctor Zach played by Chris Berg; who is becoming fierce competition for Frasier's radio show. Frasier gets all hot and bothered but not as hot and bothered when an insistent and persistent agent corners him and Kenny in the locker room of his club, with fire in her eyes and a few squats to convince him that she can take his career to the next level. Frasier inherits a new fiery agent and Doctor Zach loses his pants; literally!Bulldog only shows up later in the season for standard fare and a short scene. The supporting cast are generally absent; even Eddie, Martin's dog has fewer scenes except in the episode `Juvenilia' where he gets to shine in an inspired scene with Niles!A few highlights are; `Frasier Has Spokane' where Frasier tries to host in a hostile city and Daphne becomes a carpenter for a day while Niles tries to be her submissive aid and Martin takes a back seat to her skills, `The Guilt Trippers' where Frasier sleeps with Roz, flies to Wisconsin and entertains Roz's family also `Moons Over Seattle' where Niles having flown to Britain puts up being manhandled so he can convince Daphne's father played by Brian Cox to join him for a family reunion which ends up with a dog jumping Niles leg, a fire in the middle of St. Henri, Frasier getting ousted out of his favourite restaurant and Daphne's touching declaration of love! This season also boasts the return of most of the Cheers cast in `Cheerful Goodbyes' it is painful for me to watch my favourite characters age; I always loved their energy and comic timing.In the final analysis this season is one for the archives; one of the best in the series!",5,all over the place!!!!,1281225600,"08 8, 2010",2010,4774,"['season', 'eight', 'been', 'different', 'direction', 'series', 'away', 'initial', 'formula', 'digging', 'deeper', 'psychiatry', 'personal', 'psychology', 'relationships', 'characters', 'Season', 'nine', 'literally', 'where', 'season', 'eight', 'left', 'off', 'two-part', 'episode', 'where', 'affections', 'Claire', 'lust', 'Lana', 'following', 'episode', 'ex-wives', 'fianc', 'eacute', 's', 'Mother', 'come', 'nest', 'confused', 'mind', 'try', 'answer', 'old-age', 'Frasier', 'question', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hold', 'relationship', 'woman', 'When', 'Frasier', 'escape', 'self-', 'inflicted', 'analysis', 'manifested', 'door', 'escape', 'women', 'past', 'are', 'waiting', 'other', 'side', 'classic', 'season', 'Roz', 'finally', 'dating', 'real', 'thing', 'meeting', 'Roger', 'played', 'charming', 'talented', 'Tony', 'Goldwyn', 'whom', 'Frasier', 'combination', 'gentility', 'brute', 'strength', 'relationship', 'Roz', 'deal', 'prejudices', 'see', 'Roger', 'works', 'city', 'collecting', 'garbage', 'stinks', 'according', 'her.Lana', 'son', 'Kirby', 'still', 'part', 'scene', 'few', 'episodes', 'watch', 'Kirby', 'organize', 'Niles', 'library', 'cheese', 'puffs', 'one', 'hand', 'soft', 'drink', 'other', 'Meanwhile', 'Martin', 'Frasier', 'are', 'dealing', 'old', 'demons', 'opposed', 'Daphne', 'Roz', 'who', 'are', 'dealing', 'new', 'demons', 'as', 'well', 'old', 'ones', 'Daphne', 'jealous', 'female', 'patient', 'being', 'treated', 'Niles', 'when', 'accidentally', 'confidential', 'file', 'things', 'worse', 'when', 'woman', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Niles', 'upset', 'Daphne', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Daphne', 'more', 'disoriented', 'Mother', 'brother', 'visit', 'Mother', 'comment', 'brother', 'who', ""'ll"", 'have', 'leg', 'filth', 'response', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', ""'re"", 'moving', 'comedy', 'heaven', 'Mother', 'constant', 'insults', 'when', 'roost', 'Seattle', 'followed', 'Daphne', 'giving', 'piece', 'mind', 'inspired', 'Simon', 'crude', 'behaviour', 'Crane', 'household', 'Mother', 'Load', 'topped', 'off', 'Frasier', 'throwing', 'Simon', 'street', 'luggage', 'intact', 'SPOILERS', 'AHEAD', 'icing', 'cake', 'Proposal', 'Crane', 'dirty', 'laundry', 'Niles', 'preparing', 'engagement', 'party', 'proposal', 'Daphne', 'scene', 'where', 'three', 'Cranes', 'help', 'Niles', 'buy', 'ring', 'up', 'Frasier', 'knees', 'Niles', 'wearing', 'ring', 'Martin', 'shaking', 'head', 'jewellers', 'scene', 'soon', 'followed', 'narrow', 'emergency', 'escape', 'musicians', 'chefs', 'waiters', 'angels', 'Niles', 'home', 'when', 'party', 'be', 'cancelled', 'new', 'spin', 'TV', 'comedy', 'character', 'one', 'most', 'original', 'television', 'why', 'been', 'successful', 'series', 'watching', 'tormented', 'man', 'who', 'control', 'everything', 'fall', 'pieces', 'scrambled', 'eggs', 'place', 'episode', 'been', 'fun', 'frustrating', 'ride', 'gee', 'almost', 'parts', 'life', 'been', 'there', 'done', 'Bibi', 'up', 'short', 'stint', 'only', 'one', 'scene', 'new', 'very', 'handsome', 'client', 'Doctor', 'Zach', 'played', 'Chris', 'Berg', 'who', 'becoming', 'fierce', 'competition', 'Frasier', 'radio', 'show', 'Frasier', 'hot', 'bothered', 'not', 'hot', 'bothered', 'when', 'insistent', 'persistent', 'agent', 'corners', 'Kenny', 'locker', 'room', 'club', 'fire', 'eyes', 'few', 'squats', 'convince', 'can', 'take', 'career', 'next', 'level', 'Frasier', 'new', 'fiery', 'agent', 'Doctor', 'Zach', 'pants', 'literally', 'Bulldog', 'only', 'up', 'later', 'season', 'standard', 'fare', 'short', 'scene', 'supporting', 'cast', 'are', 'generally', 'absent', 'even', 'Eddie', 'Martin', 'dog', 'fewer', 'scenes', 'episode', 'Juvenilia', 'where', 'shine', 'inspired', 'scene', 'Niles', 'A', 'few', 'highlights', 'are', 'Frasier', 'Has', 'Spokane', 'where', 'Frasier', 'host', 'hostile', 'city', 'Daphne', 'carpenter', 'day', 'Niles', 'tries', 'be', 'submissive', 'aid', 'Martin', 'back', 'seat', 'skills', 'Guilt', 'Trippers', 'where', 'Frasier', 'Roz', 'Wisconsin', 'Roz', 'family', 'also', 'Moons', 'Seattle', 'where', 'Niles', 'having', 'flown', 'Britain', 'up', 'being', 'manhandled', 'so', 'can', 'convince', 'Daphne', 'father', 'played', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'join', 'family', 'reunion', 'up', 'dog', 'jumping', 'Niles', 'leg', 'fire', 'middle', 'St.', 'Henri', 'Frasier', 'getting', 'ousted', 'favourite', 'restaurant', 'Daphne', 'touching', 'declaration', 'love', 'season', 'also', 'return', 'most', 'Cheers', 'cast', 'Cheerful', 'Goodbyes', 'painful', 'watch', 'favourite', 'characters', 'age', 'always', 'loved', 'energy', 'comic', 'timing.In', 'final', 'analysis', 'season', 'one', 'archives', 'one', 'best', 'series']",Frasier: Season 9

Season 9 is one of the better seasons of this eleven seasons series.During this season, Frasier, on a getaway at a rustic cabin, has a hallucination of his three previous girlfriends/wives. He also manages to accidentally destroy the arm chair of Martin. The reconstructed arm chair ironically is the most expensive item in his exquisitely assembled drawing room - oh the irony! Niles and Daphne plans to move in together and their plans are thwarted by the arrival of Daphne's mother. Frasier tries to un-mask Lilith's (his ex-wife) brother, a con-artist. In one memorable episode, Cliff's (a character from Cheers) farewell party introduces Niles to Frasier's past exploits at Cheers. During the season finale, Roz and Frasier sleep together, forever immortalized by the comment from Martin (""Big story about how Roz's purse spent the night on the coffee table""). And Niles is off to England to try and convince the alcoholic father of Daphne to reunite with his family.A strongly recommended season and those of you not familiar with the characters, I have added a small summary of the main characters of the show.Frasier Crane (Kelsey Grammer): The lead character. He holds degrees in psychology from Harvard University and lives in Seattle. His list of selective hobbies include playing the piano, attending the opera and expensive charity events, collecting expensive art and participating in wine tasting events. Of course his main past time is unsuccessfully trying to curb his competitive nature - especially when it comes to his brother Niles.Niles Crane (David Hyde Pierce): The undoubted star of the show IMHO. Frasier's brother and practicing psychiatrist. Niles shares similar interests and educational background to Frasier (he was however educated at Yale University) and is probably even more finicky than his brother. Niles has an aversion to bugs and has several weird characteristics (extreme ethical standards, strong food allergies, dusting the chair before sitting and so on).Martin Crane (John Mahoney): Frasier and Niles' father. He was in the police force for long until he was shot in the hip during an armed robbery. Martin moves in with Frasier (bringing his dog and a battered armchair into the life of Frasier and Daphne into the life of Niles). Martin's no-nonsense attitude and straightforward outlook on life often lead to confrontations with Frasier and Niles, who aspire to greater levels of sophistication.Daphne Moon (Jane Leeves): An immigrant from Manchester, England. Daphne was hired by Frasier to be Martin's physiotherapist. Daphne often relates bizarre tales involving her family.Roz Doyle (Peri Gilpin): Roz is the producer of Frasier's radio show. Roz is known for her relaxed attitude (especially when it comes to men) and quick-witted remarks, and enjoys deflating Frasier's ego - a favor often reciprocated by Frasier.Any way the episodes for season 9 are:Episode 1: Don Juan in Hell: Part 1Episode 2: Don Juan in Hell: Part 2Episode 3: The First Temptation of DaphneEpisode 4: The Return of Martin CraneEpisode 5: Love StinksEpisode 6: Room Full of HeroesEpisode 7: Bla-Z-BoyEpisode 8: The Two HundredthEpisode 9: Sharing KirbyEpisode 10: Junior AgentEpisode 11: Bully for MartinEpisode 12: Mother Load: Part 1Episode 13: Mother Load: Part 2Episode 14: JuveniliaEpisode 15: The ProposalEpisode 16: Wheels of FortuneEpisode 17: Three Blind DatesEpisode 18: War of the WordsEpisode 19: DeathtrapEpisode 20: The Love You FakeEpisode 21: Cheerful GoodbyesEpisode 22: Frasier Has SpokaneEpisode 23: The Guilt TrippersEpisode 24: Moons Over SeattleEnjoy!",5,Season 9 - The renaissance after season 8,1170374400,"02 2, 2007",2007,3643,"['Frasier', 'one', 'time', 'great', 'shows', 'Season', '9', 'one', 'better', 'seasons', 'eleven', 'seasons', 'series.During', 'season', 'Frasier', 'getaway', 'rustic', 'cabin', 'hallucination', 'three', 'previous', 'girlfriends/wives', 'also', 'accidentally', 'destroy', 'arm', 'chair', 'Martin', 'reconstructed', 'arm', 'chair', 'ironically', 'most', 'expensive', 'item', 'exquisitely', 'assembled', 'drawing', 'room', 'irony', 'Niles', 'Daphne', 'move', 'together', 'plans', 'are', 'thwarted', 'arrival', 'Daphne', 'mother', 'Frasier', 'un-mask', 'Lilith', 'ex-wife', 'brother', 'con-artist', 'one', 'memorable', 'episode', 'Cliff', 'character', 'Cheers', 'farewell', 'party', 'introduces', 'Niles', 'Frasier', 'past', 'exploits', 'Cheers', 'season', 'finale', 'Roz', 'Frasier', 'sleep', 'together', 'forever', 'immortalized', 'comment', 'Martin', 'Big', 'story', 'how', 'Roz', 'purse', 'spent', 'night', 'coffee', 'table', 'Niles', 'England', 'try', 'convince', 'alcoholic', 'father', 'Daphne', 'reunite', 'family.A', 'strongly', 'recommended', 'season', 'not', 'familiar', 'characters', 'have', 'added', 'small', 'summary', 'main', 'characters', 'show.Frasier', 'Crane', 'Kelsey', 'Grammer', 'lead', 'character', 'degrees', 'psychology', 'Harvard', 'University', 'Seattle', 'list', 'selective', 'hobbies', 'include', 'playing', 'piano', 'attending', 'opera', 'expensive', 'charity', 'events', 'collecting', 'expensive', 'art', 'participating', 'wine', 'tasting', 'events', 'course', 'main', 'past', 'time', 'unsuccessfully', 'trying', 'curb', 'competitive', 'nature', 'especially', 'when', 'brother', 'Niles.Niles', 'Crane', 'David', 'Hyde', 'Pierce', 'undoubted', 'star', 'show', 'IMHO', 'Frasier', 'brother', 'practicing', 'psychiatrist', 'Niles', 'shares', 'similar', 'interests', 'educational', 'background', 'Frasier', 'was', 'however', 'educated', 'Yale', 'University', 'probably', 'even', 'more', 'finicky', 'brother', 'Niles', 'aversion', 'bugs', 'several', 'weird', 'characteristics', 'extreme', 'ethical', 'standards', 'strong', 'food', 'allergies', 'dusting', 'chair', 'sitting', 'so', '.Martin', 'Crane', 'John', 'Mahoney', 'Frasier', 'Niles', 'father', 'was', 'police', 'force', 'long', 'was', 'shot', 'hip', 'armed', 'robbery', 'Martin', 'Frasier', 'bringing', 'dog', 'battered', 'armchair', 'life', 'Frasier', 'Daphne', 'life', 'Niles', 'Martin', 'no-nonsense', 'attitude', 'straightforward', 'outlook', 'life', 'often', 'lead', 'confrontations', 'Frasier', 'Niles', 'who', 'aspire', 'greater', 'levels', 'sophistication.Daphne', 'Moon', 'Jane', 'Leeves', 'immigrant', 'Manchester', 'England', 'Daphne', 'was', 'hired', 'Frasier', 'be', 'Martin', 'physiotherapist', 'Daphne', 'often', 'bizarre', 'tales', 'involving', 'family.Roz', 'Doyle', 'Peri', 'Gilpin', 'Roz', 'producer', 'Frasier', 'radio', 'show', 'Roz', 'known', 'relaxed', 'attitude', 'especially', 'when', 'men', 'quick-witted', 'remarks', 'deflating', 'Frasier', 'ego', 'favor', 'often', 'reciprocated', 'Frasier.Any', 'way', 'episodes', 'season', '9', 'are', 'Episode', '1', 'Don', 'Juan', 'Hell', 'Part', '1Episode', '2', 'Don', 'Juan', 'Hell', 'Part', '2Episode', '3', 'First', 'Temptation', 'DaphneEpisode', '4', 'Return', 'Martin', 'CraneEpisode', '5', 'Love', 'StinksEpisode', '6', 'Room', 'Full', 'HeroesEpisode', '7', 'Bla-Z-BoyEpisode', '8', 'Two', 'HundredthEpisode', '9', 'Sharing', 'KirbyEpisode', '10', 'Junior', 'AgentEpisode', '11', 'Bully', 'MartinEpisode', '12', 'Mother', 'Load', 'Part', '1Episode', '13', 'Mother', 'Load', 'Part', '2Episode', '14', 'JuveniliaEpisode', '15', 'ProposalEpisode', '16', 'Wheels', 'FortuneEpisode', '17', 'Three', 'Blind', 'DatesEpisode', '18', 'War', 'WordsEpisode', '19', 'DeathtrapEpisode', '20', 'Love', 'FakeEpisode', '21', 'Cheerful', 'GoodbyesEpisode', '22', 'Frasier', 'Has', 'SpokaneEpisode', '23', 'Guilt', 'TrippersEpisode', '24', 'Moons', 'SeattleEnjoy']",Frasier: Season 9
