58078,A20LY8E9NGYA4M,0783227280,Alejandro Cortes,"[2, 3]","""The Boxer"" is another collaboration between director Jim Sheridan and the fantastic actor Daniel Day-Lewis, with nice results once again.After a 14 year prison sentence for IRA activities, Danny Flynn (Daniel Day-Lewis), a former boxer decides to make a return to the boxing world. Danny, now 32 years old, decides to be both a veteran boxer and an assistant coach for the kids interested in learning the sport. Danny is now struggling to return to a good shape, and in addition he sees a former girlfriend, Maggie (Emily Watson), an attractive woman that in Danny's absence, married with another militant IRA member, now in prison. Danny and Maggie still feel something about each other, but the encountering opposition from militant IRA members and political tensions will prove hard to beat.Following the line of ""In The Name Of The Father"", ""The Boxer""  is another well acted and interesting political drama, also with the Sheridan / Day-Lewis team.

It's hard not to get involved in the life of Danny Flynn, played by Daniel Day-Lewis and Maggie, played beautifully by the amazing Emily Watson.  This is probably my favorite film to address the conflict in Northern Ireland.  The film reeks of the tension and brooding atmosphere of that troubled area of the world.  Flynn is a boxer who has just been released from prison after fourteen years.  He returns to a home where nothing is what it once was; his girlfriend is married and has a son, his neighbors are suspicious of him, the neighborhood goons attempt to suck him back into his old life.  All he wants to do is run a gym and box.  The development of the story is heartbreaking as Maggie and Danny begin to rediscover old feelings for each other in the midst of the turmoil.  Maggie's husband is in prison himself, and Danny must tread carefully to avoid upsetting anyone.  Loyalties change and are questioned.  When Danny bucks the system things begin to get interesting...A beautiful film with gorgeous color and a high quality DVD transfer in every respect.

And Daniel Day-Lewis becomes another victim to the long line of actors. So, the real question is: did he succeed in it? Well, he did well for what he could do, and it was a good Daniel Day-Lewis performance, but it's not in the same league as My Left Foot and The Last of the Mohicans. After doing The Boxer, he wouldn't do another film for next five years. Probably it was a very unsatisfying role for him. On the other side, the whole I.R.A. crap and the silly war of religions really killed the film for me because I couldn't care less. Even worse was the weak chemistry between Daniel Day-Lewis and (or should I say the non-existent acting from) Emily Watson. At least Brian Cox was pretty good himself in it. I do remember seeing The Boxer after it came out in 1997, and it was an unremarkable picture back then. And it still is now. In fact, we still have no idea what Danny Flynn served fourteen years for. One aspect of the screen I am so sick and tired of is how blue (green, gray, brown, yellow, whatever) the vision is. Just use a clear lens, please.

(The latter plays the role of Danny Flynn, a man imprisoned for 14 years for his role in an IRA bombing.)More fool me. THE BOXER slowly impresses the viewer with its complex storyline, quiet demeanor and subtle dialogue. Watson and Lewis absolutely nail their roles as lovers who were separated at the age of 18, and now find themselves in the awkward roles of adults resuming a teenaged courtship. In a Hollywood film, the two would ultimately hop into bed with a rousing musical score; not so here.While Watson and Lewis bring uncanny eloquence to their soft-spoken characters, perhaps most fascinating about THE BOXER is the culture of Ireland, specifically the political etiquette and sectarian hatred that each character has to dance around with.SIDELIGHTS: This film is only nominally about boxing.

58085,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,0783227280,C. B Collins Jr.,"[1, 1]","This film about the conflict in Northern Ireland between the British and the Irish is extremely well done with a balance between the lives of the characters and the larger structural historic forces that impact their relationships.Daniel Day Lewis plays the character of Danny Flynn, a 32 year old man who has just spent 14 years in prison for IRA activities. When Danny was 18, and an outstanding promising young boxer, he engaged in IRA activities and took a longer sentence so as to protect his colleagues. He returns from prison, not defeated and soul-dead, but philosophically centered. He finds his old boxing coach, who has become a homeless alcoholic, and together they try to establish a sectarian boxing school that allows both Catholic and Protestant boys the opportunity to learn how to box.He leaves prison at a time when critical strategic negotiations are occurring between the IRA and the Belfast Police. Prior to his imprisonment Danny was in love with young Maggie Hamill. After his incarceration she married another IRA man, whom she never really loved. This man is currently imprisoned. There is an IRA social norm that no one courts or has affairs with women whose husbands are imprisoned for the IRA cause, thus strengthening the social norms around terrorist activities. A man who thought his wife might leave him for another man while he was imprisoned would be less likely to commit acts of violence against the British. Thus the IRA maintains a strong social network to ensure that fighters remain loyal. Entire housing projects have been modified so that hidden passages between apartments have been created to allow IRA member to enter one apartment and exit another. The leader, Joe Hamill, played by Brian Cox, is under constant surveillance and therefore must live and operate in this maze.The film's strength is that it perfectly displays the point in an insurrection whereby the insurrection splits between those that are ready to negotiate and end conflict and those that wish to continue the conflict. Joe Hamill has finally reached a point in the negotiation whereby some progress can be made toward peace. The release of Danny Flynn, who has become a neutral partisan after his long incarceration, who at first be an advantage for Joe Hamill. However, the mounting and increased attraction between Danny, and the daughter of Joe, played very well by Emily Watson, violates the IRA norm against courtship of IRA women with imprisoned husbands. This gives the IRA camp that wishes to increase and continue the conflict the very cards they need to play to undermine Joe Hamill.The film has the viewer moving up and down on emotional roller coasters as you become invested in the relationship between Danny and Emily, in Danny's school for young boxers, in Joe's delicate negotiation process, and in the forces that wish to undermine it all because they are so filled with hatred that they emotionally can never give up the desire for revenge. The ending is tense, surprising, and plausible and I don't want to spoil it for future viewers.In the end the screen writers, film makers and actors have give us an incredible gift. The tragedy that surrounds the situation in Northern Ireland is made more real through the struggles of the characters. The complexities of the political situations are made more real through the plot and subplots that move the film forward. You will finish the film with mixed emotions with hope that one day Ireland will be at peace and yet with real knowledge that peace is only obtainable through the work of human intervention, a process fraught with failability.",5,A classic film  that is under-rated yet excellent,1200096000,"01 12, 2008",2008,3627,"['film', 'conflict', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'British', 'Irish', 'extremely', 'well', 'done', 'balance', 'lives', 'characters', 'larger', 'structural', 'historic', 'forces', 'impact', 'relationships.Daniel', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'character', 'Danny', 'Flynn', '32', 'year', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'just', 'spent', '14', 'years', 'prison', 'IRA', 'activities', 'When', 'Danny', 'was', '18', 'outstanding', 'promising', 'young', 'boxer', 'engaged', 'IRA', 'activities', 'took', 'longer', 'sentence', 'so', 'protect', 'colleagues', 'prison', 'not', 'defeated', 'soul-dead', 'philosophically', 'centered', 'old', 'boxing', 'coach', 'who', 'become', 'homeless', 'alcoholic', 'together', 'try', 'establish', 'sectarian', 'boxing', 'school', 'Catholic', 'Protestant', 'opportunity', 'learn', 'how', 'box.He', 'leaves', 'prison', 'time', 'when', 'critical', 'strategic', 'negotiations', 'are', 'occurring', 'IRA', 'Belfast', 'Police', 'Prior', 'imprisonment', 'Danny', 'was', 'love', 'young', 'Maggie', 'Hamill', 'incarceration', 'married', 'IRA', 'man', 'whom', 'never', 'really', 'loved', 'man', 'currently', 'imprisoned', 'IRA', 'social', 'norm', 'one', 'affairs', 'women', 'husbands', 'are', 'imprisoned', 'IRA', 'cause', 'thus', 'strengthening', 'social', 'norms', 'terrorist', 'activities', 'man', 'who', 'thought', 'wife', 'might', 'leave', 'man', 'was', 'imprisoned', 'would', 'be', 'less', 'likely', 'commit', 'acts', 'violence', 'British', 'Thus', 'IRA', 'strong', 'social', 'network', 'ensure', 'fighters', 'remain', 'loyal', 'Entire', 'housing', 'projects', 'have', 'been', 'modified', 'hidden', 'passages', 'apartments', 'have', 'been', 'created', 'allow', 'IRA', 'member', 'enter', 'one', 'apartment', 'exit', 'leader', 'Joe', 'Hamill', 'played', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'constant', 'surveillance', 'therefore', 'must', 'live', 'operate', 'maze.The', 'film', 'strength', 'perfectly', 'point', 'insurrection', 'whereby', 'insurrection', 'splits', 'are', 'ready', 'negotiate', 'end', 'conflict', 'wish', 'continue', 'conflict', 'Joe', 'Hamill', 'finally', 'reached', 'point', 'negotiation', 'whereby', 'progress', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'peace', 'release', 'Danny', 'Flynn', 'who', 'become', 'neutral', 'partisan', 'long', 'incarceration', 'who', 'first', 'be', 'advantage', 'Joe', 'Hamill', 'However', 'mounting', 'increased', 'attraction', 'Danny', 'daughter', 'Joe', 'played', 'very', 'well', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'IRA', 'norm', 'courtship', 'IRA', 'women', 'imprisoned', 'husbands', 'IRA', 'camp', 'increase', 'continue', 'conflict', 'very', 'cards', 'need', 'play', 'undermine', 'Joe', 'Hamill.The', 'film', 'viewer', 'moving', 'up', 'down', 'emotional', 'roller', 'coasters', 'become', 'invested', 'relationship', 'Danny', 'Emily', 'Danny', 'school', 'young', 'boxers', 'Joe', 'delicate', 'negotiation', 'process', 'forces', 'wish', 'undermine', 'are', 'so', 'filled', 'hatred', 'emotionally', 'can', 'never', 'give', 'up', 'desire', 'revenge', 'ending', 'tense', 'surprising', 'plausible', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'future', 'viewers.In', 'end', 'screen', 'writers', 'film', 'makers', 'actors', 'have', 'give', 'incredible', 'gift', 'tragedy', 'situation', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'made', 'more', 'real', 'struggles', 'characters', 'complexities', 'political', 'situations', 'are', 'made', 'more', 'real', 'plot', 'subplots', 'move', 'film', 'forward', 'will', 'finish', 'film', 'mixed', 'emotions', 'hope', 'one', 'day', 'Ireland', 'will', 'be', 'peace', 'yet', 'real', 'knowledge', 'peace', 'only', 'obtainable', 'work', 'human', 'intervention', 'process', 'fraught', 'failability']",N/A

The trailers that I saw in theaters a few years back almost suggested one of those &quot;lovers-torn-apart-in-a-world-gone-mad&quot; films that we've all come to know and find suspect.  But the tone of the actual film is really quite muted.What makes &quot;The Boxer&quot; ring true is the very tentativeness of the relationship between Daniel Day-Lewis and Emily Watson's characters.  One time teenage lovers, they have been separated for 14 years while Danny Flynn (Day-Lewis) served a prison term for unspecified political activity.  Released now, at the age of 32, he wants only to be left alone and to resume his boxing career.  To Sheridan's credit, the irony that the BOXER has, in fact, become a man of peace is not dwelled upon.  Nor is the tentative reunion with his lost love exactly the stuff of Sturm und Drang.There is an overall sense of Irish reserve in the film, a sense that brutal political realities have left all of its characters emotionally stunted.

The film assumes we know and we are on the side of the Irish Catholics who are trying to get out of the war because there is no real solution in the war, but also, though with less emphasis, on the side of the Protestants who know that time is just playing against their majority which will be a forgotten illusion within a few years and then the reversal of majorities would be the bitterest and direst catastrophe for these very Protestants. A peaceful negociated solution must be found. But the film looks at the problem, at the Good Friday Agreement through the eyes of persons, of individuals, both Catholics who have political or military power and Catholics who are just plain simple ordinary men, women or children. At the top level some cleansing is necessary, some military leaders who do not want to undestand that the political leaders must always have the last word and the last decision, have to be eliminated or neutralized. That is not very easy nor comfortable nor clean. At the bottom level, the emotions and feelings and sentiments of simple people are both pathetic because of their powerlessness, and admirable because of their total commitment to their fulfilment. I love him or her and I will love him or her no matter who says I should not and no matter what it may cost me. Thus the film becomes universal and speaks of all social and civil wars with the participation of some foreign troops. The precise civil and social cause is demultiplied by the national sentiment that is provoked on one side by what they consider as an invasion and an occupation. The film is admirable in its reserve and moderation : it shows the situations, the passions of all these people but it keeps some dignity even in cases when butchery would be a better word for assassination. And more than ten years later the situation has not yet come to an agreed upon and duly negociated settlement.

58096,AYPS4RCXEFSJP,0783227280,K. Boullosa,"[1, 3]","I'm not quite sure why ""The Boxer"" isn't better than it is, given its sterling credentials: directed and co-written by Jim Sheridan, and a cast that stars Daniel Day Lewis and Emily Watson, supported by a magnificent group of deservedly well-known character actors. This is one of those odd instances in which a work ends up being less, rather than more, than the sum of its parts.However, ""The Boxer"" is most certainly still worth your time at least for one viewing, if only for the performances, my admiration for which is by no means limited to the expectedly fine ones of Day-Lewis as sometime boxer and IRA soldier, Danny Flynn, and Emily Watson as Maggie Hamill, the love of his life.  See this also, among others, for the deeply affecting, sad, and powerful, if brief, performance of Scottish actor Ken Stott (perhaps more familiar to American audiences for his work on a grim BBC Crime series ""The Vice"") as Ike Weir, Danny's boyhood boxing trainer.The movie takes place in the rough Catholic neighborhoods of Belfast, as Flynn is released from a 15-year prison sentence for involvement with IRA activities.  During his prison term, Flynn refused to invite any leniency by revealing anything or anyone else he knew in connection with those activities, which has earned him grudging respect from his former IRA mates.  However, they also know that Danny is disillusioned with the Cause and unlikely to return to the fight.  He is only alive and left alone, at least at first, because of his silence while in prison.Flynn's two primary goals after his release are to return to boxing (he is shown keeping himself in shape while in prison), and to see what has become of the girl he left behind, Maggie Hamill.  Maggie feels as strongly toward Danny as he does toward her, and wanted to wait for him, but fearing she would waste her life, he released her and she married another IRA soldier and had a son with him, 12-year-old Liam. The marriage proved to be loveless, but, ironically, Maggie's husband is now also in prison, which is bad luck for Danny and Maggie, for there is no sin more grievous in this culture than to take up with a Prisoner's Wife (the film opens with a prison wedding).Maggie's father, Joe (Brian Cox), is a high-ranking IRA leader trying to negotiate a viable peace settlement with the British. He is hampered in this by the intransigence of one of his District leaders, Harry (Gerard McSorley) who is not interested in peace with concessions, and wants to keep fighting until the British are completely out of Northern Ireland. Harry has lost his young son in ""the Troubles"" and his heartbroken wife, Agnes, has never really recovered.Flynn goes back to the old neighborhood gym where he trained in his youth, virtually pulling his old trainer, Ike, out of the gutter as he does so.  The two set up a boxing club that welcomes both Catholic and Protestant youth, that is enthusiastically received by the boys it serves.  This does not sit well with those like Harry, who don't want peace on these terms.  Inevitably, Danny's and Ike's attempt to bring some healing to the community opens up other rifts, violence ensues, and the gym is burned.  To Maggie's horror, she finds out that her son Liam participated in the arson, out of loyalty to his jailed father, because he sees his mother becoming close again to Danny and fears she will desert him and flee with Danny.Maggie's newly revived relationship with Danny is not lost on her father or Danny's former IRA compatriots - even though the two have not actually slept together.  Both are threatened with violence, but Danny refuses to leave the neighborhood or give up Maggie, especially after Ike is murdered by Harry.  At last, Maggie's father and some of his lieutenants take matters into their own hands and kill Harry just before he ""executes"" Danny - not as a favor to Danny or Maggie, but because Harry will foment violence if he is not stopped, to undo the peace settlement just negotiated with Britain.  The movie ends suddenly here, with even Liam seen as  understanding the complexity of his mother's situation, and dropping his anger toward Danny.The film has affecting moments, but the script is curiously lacking in depth vis-a-vis both the political and personal situations.  The tie-up at the end occurs much too quickly and is a bit pat.  As noted, the performances are wonderful, the cinematography likewise, and the film has a beautiful score.

Many of the films show the IRA as the protagonist, when, in fact, they share in the guilt that comes along with 30 years of untractable social and political conflict. It's nice to know that some of the paramilitaries have changed with the times, but it's still a concern that so many of them still feel the gun is the only answer to Northern Ireland's problems.

I assume that's the real Day-Lewis in this flick about the rebellion in Northern Ireland, revenge and absolution. His romantic interest, Emily Watson, puts in a good performance too. Day-Lewis looks a lot different than he did in &quot;Gangs of New York&quot;, &quot;The Unbearable Lightness of Being&quot;, &quot;My Left Foot&quot; and &quot;Last of the Mohicans&quot; but he is just as compelling in his performance.

58099,A2NQUGGYM0DBM1,0783227280,L.A. Scene,"[4, 6]","Back in the 1980s, I became a huge fan of Barry McGuigan.  McGuigan not only dethroned a long-time champion in Eusebio Pedroza to capture the World Featherweight Championship, but he had a most interesting story as well.  McGuigan was a Catholic from Clones Ireland.  At a time when Catholics and Protestants were in a deeply-rooted conflict in Northern Ireland, McGuigan married his Protestant girlfriend.  Both had a desire to bring peace to both the Protestants and Catholics.  As McGuigan would make a run for the World Title, he would soon succeed in bringing the factions together.  My interest in McGuigan and McGuigan's story was always high - so when I found out that McGuigan was going to be involved in Jim Sheridan's film, ""The Boxer"" - I immediately took an interest.  McGuigan's story would loosely be part of the story of ""The Boxer"" and McGuigan would serve as a Boxing Consultant for the film's star - Daniel Day-Lewis.  In terms of Boxing being the vehicle between uniting Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland - that will the common thread of ""The Boxer"" to McGuigan's story.  It really turns out that Boxing is the secondary story to a complex story of love and war in terms of the conflict that went on in the 1990s in Northern Ireland.  The complexities of the story are about the only weak point of what is a very good movie.The politics of the conflict in Northern Ireland are probably what makes the movie very complex.  I wasn't very familiar with the politics behind the situation.  After watching the movie a few times and reading some background on the turmoil that took place, I soon really began to appreciate what a great story this is.  Day-Lewis plays Danny Flynn.  The movie opens with Flynn being released from a Belfast prison for being involved with IRA activities.  Prior to his arrest, Flynn was a promising boxer.  During his prison stay, Flynn could have ""squealed"" on others, but chose to keep quiet.  It was during his time in prison that Flynn became disenchanted with the whole Protestant-Catholic conflict.  Upon returning from prison, Flynn not only seeks to resurrect his Boxing career, but he wishes to renew his relationship with his former girlfriend, Maggie (played by Emily Watson).  Getting back with Maggie is not easy - Maggie has since married and had a son.  It turns out that Maggie's husband has been imprisoned as well.  While Maggie was in a loveless marriage, it isn't easy to get back with Flynn because the IRA forbids prisoner's wives to cheat (there are deadly consequences).  Things are even more complicated because it is Maggie's father, Joe Hamill (played by Brian Cox) is an IRA leader who is trying to negotiate a peaceful settlement with the British (Protestants).  Joe is facing internal turmoil because one of his District leaders, Harry (played by Gerard McSorley) doesn't believe in peace and prefers to keep the conflict going.  As Flynn's career resurrects, his performances in the ring suddenly begin to bring the Catholics and Protestants together - much to Flynn's satisfaction.  It's Harry who doesn't believe in Flynn's peaceful motives.  Joe is now in a difficult spot because his daughter (a prisoner's wife) is getting close to Flynn.  At the same time Harry is not only frowning on that, but frowning on Flynn's ""peaceful"" motives.  It is this web that is going to lead to the film's emotional climax.Much of this movie is a ""dark"" movie.  While I have not been to Belfast and am not familiar with the neighborhoods in Belfast, I have heard from some people who have lived there that the neighborhood that is shown in ""The Boxer"" is greatly exaggerated.  I have no way of knowing if this is true or not, I'm just going by the words of others.  It is the neighborhood that is portrayed in this movie that helps contribute to the ""dark element"".Day-Lewis was an actor in the 1990s who was considered the best in the business.  His role in ""The Boxer"" is no exception, however I think Day-Lewis' performance as Danny Flynn isn't in his words - but in his actions.  Sure, the McGuigan coached Boxing sequences are terrific, but as a ""gentle pugilist and peacemaker"", it is Day-Lewis' quiet mannerisms and intensity that are really going to merit this performance.  Sometimes acting is more than just memorizing the words of the script - and this movie proves that theory true.Perhaps the movie's best performance is delivered by Scottish actor Ken Stott.  Stott plays Ike Weir - a Belfast drunk who once worked with Flynn in the ring who will now once again become his trainer as he resurrects his career.  Obviously Ike's drunken moments are going to be the highlights of the movie - but Ike as a character is going to have other moments.  In particular, I like how Sheridan develops Ike's character into one that isn't going to be afraid to ""run away"" from Belfast.Although the Boxing angle is going to be the secondary story here, the Boxing is going to be excellent.  Sure the Boxing choreography of Sylvester Stallone in the ""Rocky"" movies are going to be more entertaining, but the Boxing choreography in ""The Boxer"" is real.  If you have seen Barry McGuigan fight, you are going to see Day-Lewis emulate his style - and the fight sequences are done with realism.  You aren't going to see many Big Arena championship matches in this movie.  Most of the sequences are club fights - and that just adds to the whole charm of the movie.This is a terrific movie.  As I mentioned, if you can understand the politics of the situation - and in particular understand Joe and Harry's role in the IRA, you will soon see the pieces of the movie put together.  Even if you aren't a Sports fan, the story should still be appealing.  Highly recommended.",5,A Different Kind of Sports Movie,1122768000,"07 31, 2005",2005,5738,"['Back', '1980s', 'became', 'huge', 'fan', 'Barry', 'McGuigan', 'McGuigan', 'not', 'only', 'dethroned',

The setting is Belfast, where the Catholic and Protestant sections are divided by concrete walls, barb-wire fences, and machine-gun toting soldiers. Danny Flynn, played by Daniel Day-Lewis, is a Catholic former IRA member who is released from prison after serving 14 years. He comes home with the intention of resuming his boxing career, and staying out of trouble. He immediately starts up his old gym, and at first, things are going well. Along with his own training, the gym becomes a sort of refuge for neighborhood kids, and boxing becomes a constructive outlet in an otherwise negative environment. But when the gym starts trying to bring together Catholics and Protestants in the name of boxing, some of Flynn's old IRA comrades think he has gone too far. On top of this, Flynn manages to ruffle more feathers by falling back in love with his old girlfriend, who has since married another imprisoned IRA member. Naturally, in the underworld culture of the IRA, this is a big no-no. Realizing his predicament, Flynn decides to leave for London where he attempts to resume his boxing career. But deciding that no one will run him out of his home, he soon returns to Belfast determined to stand his ground and follow his heart.This film was right up my alley. I am of Irish descent, I'm a huge boxing fan, and also an aspiring historian. So naturally, a boxing film, set in war-torn Northern Ireland would seem to be my kind of movie. I was not disappointed. The boxing scenes were very well done, and Day-Lewis comes off as a very convincing fighter. He is, in my opinion, one of the best and most under-rated actors in the business. His performance here only reinforced that belief. Overall, the acting in the film was fantastic, with several outstanding performances.

The picture was filmed in spherical and shown at 1.85:1, however, the DVD framing is excellent as I did not encounter any striking  crop. Images are sharp in the usual DVD standard, but there are some dirts  on the print, some slight shimmering on the brighter objects, and few noise  on background scenes. Colors are warm and well saturated with cool blue  lighting as the predominant color. The picture is shot in a perpetual state  of dreariness as there aren't many bright settings. Black and shadow detail  are well defined.The encoded soundtrack is limited in the surrounds,  but has a wide frontal stage. Some decent panning effects provide by the  constant sound of helicopter whizzing overhead. Bass extension is forceful  on the few explosions, but is otherwise restrained. The well recorded score  generates most of the dynamic responses. Dialogue is well integrated.The  supplemental materials are quite a package. For starter, you get two  commentary tracks by the director and producer, but I've to say that it's  kind of overkill for this movie. I would rather have a single track with  them together. There is a 22-minute featurette that takes you  behind-the-scenes with interviews from the leading actors, director, and  trainer Barry McGuigan. The most interesting bit is the part on training  Daniel Day-Lewis to be a boxer. His sheer determination and relentless  workout amazed the trainer. McGuigan declares that Day-Lewis is good enough  to fight the top ten fighters in Ireland. I'll pay to see that. Then there  are about 15 minutes worth of deleted scenes, some of which revealed more  insight to the story, such as the scene showing Maggie visiting her husband  Tommy in jail, he is often refered to but not shown in the final cut. There  is also an alternate ending, which I will explain on the bottom of the  page. Both the production notes and biography are well in-depth.Director Jim Sheridan (Some Mother's Son, In the Name of the Father)  obviously has a tremendous insight and account to the political conflict  and struggle in Ireland as all his previous films demonstrated; The Boxer  is no exception. Amidst the chaotic backdrop is an earnest love story and  the lives of those that are needlessly victimized by the insane political  conflict.

His wounded slow burn as Danny Flynn, a man recently released from prison after more than a decade, returning to his old neighborhood and trying to escape the ghosts of his past but confronted by the woman he (still) loves, who has married and had a child and a host of friends still separated by the politics of war is a quiet revelation. While his attempt to revive his career as a fighter fizzles and his life is under constant threat, Danny makes the most of his situation by standing up against the opression and laws that have cost so many of his friends their freedom and in some cases, their lives. Emily Watson is note perfect as his former love interest and she brings a quiet dignity to her role as a single mother torn between devotion to her imprisoned husband, protecting her pre-teen son, and her resurging feelings for Danny. While many won't like the tone and pacing of this film, I find it entrancing and marvel at Day-Lewis vulnerable, quiet power.
