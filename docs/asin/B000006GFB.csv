The story is pretty basic- guy likes girl who seems to have no problem de-flowering him despite the fact that he is the dorky loser virgin nice guy. His best and only friend is the cool cat new to town who has the hots for a girl out of his price league. Not much really exciting happens unless you count the sex scene where the virgin loses his virginity to the slutty girl who happens to be a very fully naked Kelly Preston way before she became Mrs. John Travolta. I saw WAY more than I wanted to see of Mrs. Travolta whose rug, by the way, does NOT match the curtains. Don't know why but I always thought she was a natural blonde. But NOOOO! Anyway this is just a cute little high school movie with a love triangle since the geeky Jami Gertz has a crush on the nerdy virgin.

Set in the 1950s, the film exudes this happy-go-lucky innocence that is absolutely charming.The cast is great, featuring Doug McKeon as a ""Fonzie"" type guy who wears a leather jacket, and Chris Nash as a nerdy (let's make that VERY nerdy) teenager who is trying his best to lose his virginity.  The friendship that develops between this unlikely pair is a treat to see.  It makes the movie a feel-good kind of experience that you will savor for days after the credits roll.The female side includes the lovely Catherine Marie Stewart, playing a wholesome 1950s girl.  Kelly Preston plays a shallow & superficial babe who acts as a foil to Stewart's personage.  As tender as this all sounds, I would not recommend this film for family viewing.  Preston does a nude scene and I must concede.......she has one of the most incredible bodies I've ever seen.The 1950s Rock & Roll songs in the movie are a wonderful complement to the story on-screen.  In truth, I've never cared too much for 50's Rock.  However, in this movie I found the songs very refreshing.  They did a lot to re-inforce the 1950s feel.  In fact, the songs comprise the whole soundtrack - there is no incidental music @ all in the entire film.If you're looking for an RC movie that covers different territory than the present day movies, you may well like this one.

494266,AZ1UFPNARPZD2,B000006GFB,"Jeffrey Ellis ""bored recluse""","[150, 155]","This isn't a great film but its still one of my personal favorites.  Basically, this storyline is familiar from anyone who saw any teen films in the mid-80s.  Likeable but nerdy boy falls for the school beauty and, with the help of a much cooler James Dean type, pursues her against tremendous odds (well, against her football player boyfriend anyway) and in the end, discovers that beauty is only skin deep.  However, this film manages to take that basic concept and actually liven it up with a sharp script, breezy direction that keeps the story moving, and finally some really winning performances, especially from Doug McKeon (the likeable geek in question who is hardly portrayed as an angel here), Catherine Mary Stewart as the type of girl we all actually loved in high school but didn't know how to talk to until college, and especially a talented actor named Chris Nash who takes on the stereotypical James Dean/rebel-without-a-cause role and actually reveals to us a vulnerable, genuinely likeable human being.  Nash's genius is that even though he's playing Dean's character, he doesn't allow himself to fall into a slavish imitation of Dean as so many other young actors have a tendency to do.  Instead, he creates his own, unique rebel.  Whatever happened to Nash after this film?  Of course, the film's real claim to popularity seems to be that McKeon's dream girl is played by Kelly Preston, back in her days when she was the hot blonde in every teen movie and had yet to marry John Travolta.  Though underrated as an actress, the true key to Preston's success in those films was her willingness to do more nudity than other young actresses and this film contains what is probably her best and most celebrated nude scene.  Of course, it helps that its also one of the rare explicit movie scenes that actually makes sense in terms of the plot, doesn't feel like exploitation, and actually has an unexpected payoff.  This is a film about sex and at times, its fairly explicit but its also very humorous and honest.  Watching this film, the characters truly come alive and you actually feel like you are just watching a bunch of teenage friends living the best years of their lives.",4,A personal favorite,1001635200,"09 28, 2001",2001,2194,"[""n't"", 'great', 'film', 'still', 'one', 'personal', 'favorites', 'Basically', 'storyline', 'familiar', 'anyone', 'who', 'saw', 'teen', 'films', 'mid-80s', 'Likeable', 'nerdy', 'boy', 'school', 'beauty', 'help', 'much', 'cooler', 'James', 'Dean', 'type', 'tremendous', 'odds', 'well', 'football', 'player', 'boyfriend', 'anyway', 'end', 'discovers', 'beauty', 'only', 'skin', 'deep', 'However', 'film', 'take', 'basic', 'concept', 'actually', 'liven', 'up', 'sharp', 'script', 'breezy', 'direction', 'story', 'moving', 'finally', 'really', 'winning', 'performances', 'especially', 'Doug', 'McKeon', 'likeable', 'geek', 'question', 'who', 'hardly', 'portrayed', 'angel', 'here', 'Catherine', 'Mary', 'Stewart', 'type', 'girl', 'actually', 'loved', 'high', 'school', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'talk', 'college', 'especially', 'talented', 'actor', 'named', 'Chris', 'Nash', 'who', 'stereotypical', 'James', 'Dean/rebel-without-a-cause', 'role', 'actually', 'reveals', 'vulnerable', 'genuinely', 'likeable', 'human', 'being', 'Nash', 'genius', 'even', 'playing', 'Dean', 'character', ""n't"", 'allow', 'fall', 'slavish', 'imitation', 'Dean', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'young', 'actors', 'have', 'tendency', 'do', 'Instead', 'own', 'unique', 'rebel', 'happened', 'Nash', 'film', 'course', 'film', 'real', 'claim', 'popularity', 'be', 'McKeon', 'dream', 'girl', 'played', 'Kelly', 'Preston', 'back', 'days', 'when', 'was', 'hot', 'blonde', 'teen', 'movie', 'had', 'yet', 'marry', 'John', 'Travolta', 'Though', 'underrated', 'actress', 'true', 'key', 'Preston', 'success', 'films', 'was', 'willingness', 'do', 'more', 'nudity', 'other', 'young', 'actresses', 'film', 'what', 'probably', 'best', 'most', 'celebrated', 'nude', 'scene', 'course', 'also', 'one', 'rare', 'explicit', 'movie', 'scenes', 'actually', 'sense', 'terms', 'plot', ""n't"", 'feel', 'exploitation', 'actually', 'unexpected', 'payoff', 'film', 'sex', 'times', 'fairly', 'explicit', 'also', 'very', 'humorous', 'honest', 'Watching', 'film', 'characters', 'truly', 'come', 'alive', 'actually', 'feel', 'are', 'just', 'watching', 'bunch', 'teenage', 'friends', 'living', 'best', 'years', 'lives']",Mischief VHS

It is better than the average for this genre due to several factors. Mostly, it is because is well done.The subject matter lends itself to course treatment but that is not what is presented here. Instead, the situations are depicted with as much dignity as possible from hormone driven teenagers and is is presented with comedy.The time of the film is the 50s. Society was more innocent back then but boys still had the same thing on their minds that they always have and always will. In this case, the school geek has a bad case for the school beauty queen. He is aided in his quest by the cool loner from out of town who has his own heart set on ""the nice girl"". Meanwhile, the unpopular girl has a bad case herself for the geek.The geek achieves his goal and learns that the decorative aspects of women sometimes cover up the less desirable traits. The loner finds that the nice girl really is a nice girl and that love is something special. The unpopular girl undergoes a hormone miracle and becomes a prize catch.

494275,A1RP0XAYQEEMDM,B000006GFB,"M. Curtis ""Dr. Zaius""","[0, 1]","Once upon a time in the late eighties (1986 or so.) I was channel surfing as many of us do.  I turned on HBO to see a movie that I had heard of but did not see titled ""Mischief"" was on.  In a case of very good timing, I had turned on HBO just as Kelly Preston was stripping naked.  Needless to say I was amazed at what I saw.  Kelly Preston was so beautiful I could not believe it (What's even better was she did a full frontal scene.  Something you rarely see, at least at the time the movie was made, 1985 specifically.).  I changed channels right after that scene.  My thought was, who needs to see anything else after that!I did not think much of it for a long time afterwards.  Recently I saw the movie was available through Netflix and decided to see it just for the sake of seeing it.  As a whole ""Mischief"" is a harmless movie in the sense that it has a very good cast who does well.  In addition he producers did a very good job of recreating the time period of 1956 Ohio where the movie is set.  Once the movie was over I felt "" I have seen better I have seen worse."".  I believe that is what you will think as well.The movie gets off to a very clever start with a spoof of ""Star Wars"".  After the 20th Century Fox logo appears, you see the famous opening sentence from every ""Star Wars"" movie:  ""A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...."".  After approximately five seconds the words ""Ohio 1956"" appear on the end of the sentence.  That got a small laugh out of me.  The saying ""It's all downhill from there."" thankfully does not apply here, but as I said it's not all that great.As I said previously you can't knock the cast because they do well in their respective roles.  The standouts are Catherine Mary Stewart and, despite the fact that she only has a small part, Jami Gertz.  Speaking of Gertz, her character is one of the reasons why this movie is not all that great.  Not because of her personally or her acting ability, she does quite well in that area as I mentioned, it's just because her character uses old tired plot devices.  At the start of the movie she is an ugly nerd with braces, large glasses and her hair in pigtails.  At the movie's climax (The prom.  That's been done before.) her braces and glasses are gone and she lets her hair down to show she is actually quite attractive.  That's been done too many times before, on an episode of ""The Brady Bunch"" for example.Jonathan (Doug McKeon) spends the whole movie lusting after the stunning Marilyn (Kelly Preston).  When he finally gets her, he realizes she is not the woman for him (Yawn.).  Plot devices such as this hurt the movie, but don't kill it all together.If you're looking for something to pass a little time with on a day when you have nothing else to do, ""Mischief"" is the movie for you.  However, after you have finished watching it, you will forget about it pretty fast (Except for...).",3,"Well Made and Acted, but Forgettable (Except for One Scene).",1356566400,"12 27, 2012",2012,2889,"['Once', 'time', 'late', 'eighties', '1986', 'so', 'was', 'channel', 'surfing', 'many', 'do', 'turned', 'HBO', 'see', 'movie', 'had', 'heard', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'titled', 'Mischief', 'was', 'case', 'very', 'good', 'timing', 'had', 'turned', 'HBO', 'just', 'Kelly', 'Preston', 'was', 'stripping', 'naked', 'Needless', 'say', 'was', 'amazed', 'what', 'saw', 'Kelly', 'Preston', 'was', 'so', 'beautiful', 'could', 'not', 'believe', 'What', 'even', 'better', 'was', 'did', 'full', 'frontal', 'scene', 'Something', 'rarely', 'see', 'least', 'time', 'movie', 'was', 'made', '1985', 'specifically.', 'changed', 'channels', 'right', 'scene', 'thought', 'was', 'who', 'see', 'anything', 'else', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'much', 'long', 'time', 'afterwards', 'Recently', 'saw', 'movie', 'was', 'available', 'Netflix', 'decided', 'see', 'just', 'sake', 'seeing', 'whole', 'Mischief', 'harmless', 'movie', 'sense', 'very', 'good', 'cast', 'who', 'well', 'addition', 'producers', 'did', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'recreating', 'time', 'period', '1956', 'Ohio', 'where', 'movie', 'set', 'movie', 'was', 'felt', 'have', 'seen', 'better', 'have', 'seen', 'worse.', 'believe', 'what', 'will', 'think', 'well.The', 'movie', 'off', 'very', 'clever', 'start', 'spoof', 'Star', 'Wars', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'logo', 'see', 'famous', 'opening', 'sentence', 'Star', 'Wars', 'movie', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'galaxy', 'far', 'far', 'away', 'approximately', 'five', 'seconds', 'words', 'Ohio', '1956', 'appear', 'end', 'sentence', 'got', 'small', 'laugh', 'saying', 'downhill', 'there', 'thankfully', 'not', 'apply', 'here', 'said', 'not', 'great.As', 'said', 'previously', 'ca', ""n't"", 'knock', 'cast', 'do', 'well', 'respective', 'roles', 'standouts', 'are', 'Catherine', 'Mary', 'Stewart', 'fact', 'only', 'small', 'part', 'Jami', 'Gertz', 'Speaking', 'Gertz', 'character', 'one', 'reasons', 'why', 'movie', 'not', 'great', 'Not', 'personally', 'acting', 'ability', 'quite', 'well', 'area', 'mentioned', 'just', 'character', 'old', 'tired', 'plot', 'devices', 'start', 'movie', 'ugly', 'nerd', 'braces', 'large', 'glasses', 'hair', 'pigtails', 'movie', 'climax', 'prom', 'been', 'done', 'before', 'braces', 'glasses', 'are', 'gone', 'hair', 'show', 'actually', 'quite', 'attractive', 'been', 'done', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'before', 'episode', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'example.Jonathan', 'Doug', 'McKeon', 'whole', 'movie', 'lusting', 'stunning', 'Marilyn', 'Kelly', 'Preston', 'When', 'finally', 'not', 'woman', 'Yawn.', 'Plot', 'devices', 'such', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'kill', 'together.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'pass', 'little', 'time', 'day', 'when', 'have', 'nothing', 'else', 'do', 'Mischief', 'movie', 'However', 'have', 'finished', 'watching', 'will', 'forget', 'pretty', 'fast']",Mischief VHS

494286,A26WVK274IA7DN,B000006GFB,Sarah Bellum,"[8, 10]","(3.5/5 stars)  Something that distinguishes a good coming-of-age film from your average teen sex comedy is the ability of the filmmakers to convince the audience the experience of making the film was nostalgic, even therapeutic for them. Whether it is ""A Christmas Story,"" ""Cinema Paradiso,"" ""My Life as a Dog,"" or ""Mischief,"" the product seems like a memoir, a romanticized trip down memory lane. OK, so ""Mischief"" isn't quite the caliber of the first three; nonetheless, this little story does a good job of evoking the atmosphere of Small Town, USA in 1956. Being successful takes more than simply adding hit songs from that period of time or getting the clothing or automobile styles correct; the story needs to pull us in and get us to sympathize with some of the characters, and this film succeeds in this. The actors all do a fine job in creating this sincere tale of an average teen, Jonathan (played by Doug McKeon), who reluctantly accepts help from the cool new greaser, Gene (Chris Nash), in getting his dream girl, Marilyn (Kelly Preston). Eventually Jonathan realizes friendship means more to him than his fantasies, which would have been better left unfulfilled. Look for Terry O'Quinn, who currently plays John Locke on ""Lost,"" in a brief role as Gene's father.

His neighbor is a simpering coward with a crush on the hottest blond at school. Soon the greaser has taken charge of the wimp's sexual campaign.

494288,A3LXKO2S6G2DBI,B000006GFB,"Stephen Kaczmarek ""Educator, Writer, Consultant""","[7, 9]","I must confess a soft spot for what should have been just another throw-away 80s teenage comedy--""Mischief"" rises above the usual raunchy, unauthentic junk that pervaded the decade of my own high school experience.  With a sweet center that belies its sometimes very adult (but refreshingly honest) presentation, the film walks a fine line between maudlin and moving and in the end is just plain satisfying.  Doug McKeon (""On Golden Pond"") is Jonathan, a smart but socially awkward teenager growing up in bucolic Nelsonville, Ohio (a real place, though rather more drab and gray than presented here).  His ongoing quest for a lusty encounter with the class sexpot (the lovely, lovely Kelly Preston) gets a boost when a thoughtful ""bad boy,"" Gene (Chris Nash), moves into the neighborhood, and the two outcasts become good friends.  Gene agrees to teach Jonathan some better moves and when Gene falls in love with the girl-next-door (Catherine Mary Stuart), it's Jonathan's turn to help make a relationship happen.  There's not much in the story that isn't predictable--and today's jaded teenagers will likely find the plot corny and simplistic--but the execution in ""Mischief"" is so charming that viewers get treated to a rarity:  a teen comedy with a heart.  Great performances, a wonderful 1950s-style production, and a stellar soundtrack (that appears to have never been released in any form . . . pity) certainly help, but it's probably the fact that the teenagers here actually seem like teenagers, with that strange mixture of innocence, neediness, and horniness, rather than cynical, know-it-all adults, that makes the film work.  Believe me, in 1985, that feat alone was remarkable.  That it fizzled at the box office may have had more to do with poor marketing than poor filmmaking.",5,A Great Coming-of-Age Movie,1100131200,"11 11, 2004",2004,1791,"['must', 'confess', 'soft', 'spot', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'throw-away', '80s', 'teenage', 'comedy', 'Mischief', 'rises', 'usual', 'raunchy', 'unauthentic', 'junk', 'pervaded', 'decade', 'own', 'high', 'school', 'experience', 'sweet', 'center', 'sometimes', 'very', 'adult', 'refreshingly', 'honest', 'presentation', 'film', 'fine', 'line', 'maudlin', 'moving', 'end', 'just', 'plain', 'satisfying', 'Doug', 'McKeon', 'Golden', 'Pond', 'Jonathan', 'smart', 'socially', 'awkward', 'teenager', 'growing', 'up', 'bucolic', 'Nelsonville', 'Ohio', 'real', 'place', 'rather', 'more', 'drab', 'gray', 'presented', 'here', 'ongoing', 'quest', 'lusty', 'encounter', 'class', 'sexpot', 'lovely', 'lovely', 'Kelly', 'Preston', 'boost', 'when', 'thoughtful', 'bad', 'boy', 'Gene', 'Chris', 'Nash', 'neighborhood', 'two', 'outcasts', 'become', 'good', 'friends', 'Gene', 'teach', 'Jonathan', 'better', 'moves', 'when', 'Gene', 'love', 'girl-next-door', 'Catherine', 'Mary', 'Stuart', 'Jonathan', 'turn', 'help', 'make', 'relationship', 'happen', 'not', 'much', 'story', ""n't"", 'predictable', 'today', 'jaded', 'teenagers', 'will', 'likely', 'find', 'plot', 'corny', 'simplistic', 'execution', 'Mischief', 'so', 'charming', 'viewers', 'get', 'treated', 'rarity', 'teen', 'comedy', 'heart', 'Great', 'performances', 'wonderful', '1950s-style', 'production', 'stellar', 'soundtrack', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'released', 'form', 'pity', 'certainly', 'help', 'probably', 'fact', 'teenagers', 'here', 'actually', 'seem', 'teenagers', 'strange', 'mixture', 'innocence', 'neediness', 'horniness', 'rather', 'cynical', 'know-it-all', 'adults', 'film', 'work', 'Believe', '1985', 'feat', 'alone', 'was', 'remarkable', 'fizzled', 'box', 'office', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'do', 'poor', 'marketing', 'poor', 'filmmaking']",Mischief VHS

A sweet AMERICAN GRAFFITI knock-off with some teen 80's sex?  They changed the title to MISCHIEF to try and lure some of the PORKY's crowd, I think.Any way you look at it, this movie doesn't work.  The kid from ON GOLDEN POND makes a surly little lead character.  The tough biker kid from the wrong side of the tracks is Fonzie-lite.  You reach a point in this film where you pretty much dislike everyone and couldn't care less what happens to them.That point, for me, is the famous sex scene with the incredible Kelly Preston.  She is beyond hot and she looks spectacular naked.  This one scene is probably the only reason anyone now shows this film any interest.But afterward, all rooting interest in anyone is lost.
