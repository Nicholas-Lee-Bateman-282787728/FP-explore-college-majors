Christina Milian is so adorable and beautiful in this movie!!! The film takes place in Brooklyn,NY. The story is about a magic snowglobe and how Angela transports back & forth there. Inside the snowglobe it is the perfect Christmas! At first Angela loves the snowglobe village, but be careful what you wish for! Eventually, Angela comes to realize that nothing is perfect & she accepts her family just the way they are. At the end of the day, family is the most important thing in life. Who eats goose anyway? I'd take Lasagna anyday! lolThe interview with the cast was a nice feature because we get to see more of Christina Milian!!! The thing that made this movie cute was Xtina Milian!!! She is adorable talking with a Brooklyn accent (she was channeling Rosie Perez!) lol. If I had to be trapped in a snowglobe, I wouldn't mind it if Christina Milian was there as well!!! There are some cool Christmas songs in the movie too!!! There's a Britney Spears Xmas song and a Spice Girls Xmas song!!
