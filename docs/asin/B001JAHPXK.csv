1205625,AT1EGRXDI3NUK,B001JAHPXK,Amazon Customer,"[70, 76]","And so it ends, although there were of course two reunion sequels, one better than the other.  This year was the last one for Dallas, and the cast departures for budget cuts translating to decreased ratings obviously reached it's breaking point.  This season saw many players gone or with a reduced episode count, and the result was of course those viewers who were fans leaving.  Despite this, I feel that anytime a soap is ending, it by definition won't be as fun as when it was going on.  In retrospect, I think the only way to go was to have a sort of tragic finale where the remaining characters sort of faced their destiny.  JR deals with losing everything, Bobby loses his new wife but gains Southfork, and Cliff Barnes finally gets control of Ewing Oil.  The year is really about the tragedy of the two brothers as they slowly come to grips with losing much of all they ever thought was important in life-one being able to deal with it and the other not, in retrospect very well done.  The series finale features JR and a devil played by Joel Grey visiting an alternate reality where JR was never born and many familiar faces from the past returned.  Ultimately it is kind of a fun ride, but I must agree that it was rather unsatisfying as an ending.  Fortunately we got the first reunion in 96, JR Returns, and that was a much better conclusion for fans of the show, and that will thankfully be released soon as well.  So, for what it is, the last season of Dallas is really appropriate and as good as it could have been really.  With Barbara Bel Geddes, Charlene Tilton, and Lesley Anne Down leaving and Barbara Stock added to the main title, also starring Jared Martin as Dusty Farlow, Gayle Hunnicut as Vanessa Beaumont, Clifton James as Duke Carlisle, and John Harkins as Control, with special appearances by Susan Lucci, Barbara Eden, Mary Crosby, Linda Gray, Joel Grey, Steve Kanaly, Jack Scalia, Ted Shackelford, and Joan Van Ark.",5,The Final Season of an Epic Show,1240272000,"04 21, 2009",2009,1946,"['were', 'course', 'two', 'reunion', 'sequels', 'one', 'better', 'other', 'year', 'was', 'last', 'one', 'Dallas', 'cast', 'departures', 'budget', 'cuts', 'translating', 'decreased', 'ratings', 'obviously', 'reached', 'breaking', 'point', 'season', 'saw', 'many', 'players', 'gone', 'reduced', 'episode', 'count', 'result', 'was', 'course', 'viewers', 'who', 'were', 'fans', 'leaving', 'feel', 'soap', 'ending', 'definition', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'as', 'fun', 'when', 'was', 'going', 'retrospect', 'think', 'only', 'way', 'go', 'was', 'have', 'sort', 'tragic', 'finale', 'where', 'remaining', 'characters', 'sort', 'faced', 'destiny', 'JR', 'deals', 'losing', 'everything', 'Bobby', 'new', 'wife', 'gains', 'Southfork', 'Cliff', 'Barnes', 'finally', 'control', 'Ewing', 'Oil', 'year', 'really', 'tragedy', 'two', 'brothers', 'slowly', 'come', 'grips', 'losing', 'much', 'ever', 'thought', 'was', 'important', 'life-one', 'being', 'able', 'deal', 'other', 'not', 'retrospect', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'series', 'finale', 'features', 'JR', 'devil', 'played', 'Joel', 'Grey', 'visiting', 'alternate', 'reality', 'where', 'JR', 'was', 'never', 'born', 'many', 'familiar', 'past', 'returned', 'Ultimately', 'kind', 'fun', 'ride', 'must', 'agree', 'was', 'rather', 'unsatisfying', 'ending', 'Fortunately', 'got', 'first', 'reunion', '96', 'JR', 'Returns', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'conclusion', 'fans', 'show', 'will', 'thankfully', 'be', 'released', 'soon', 'as', 'well', 'So', 'what', 'last', 'season', 'Dallas', 'really', 'appropriate', 'as', 'good', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'Barbara', 'Bel', 'Geddes', 'Charlene', 'Tilton', 'Lesley', 'Anne', 'Down', 'leaving', 'Barbara', 'Stock', 'added', 'main', 'title', 'also', 'starring', 'Jared', 'Martin', 'Dusty', 'Farlow', 'Gayle', 'Hunnicut', 'Vanessa', 'Beaumont', 'Clifton', 'James', 'Duke', 'Carlisle', 'John', 'Harkins', 'Control', 'special', 'appearances', 'Susan', 'Lucci', 'Barbara', 'Eden', 'Mary', 'Crosby', 'Linda', 'Gray', 'Joel', 'Grey', 'Steve', 'Kanaly', 'Jack', 'Scalia', 'Ted', 'Shackelford', 'Joan', 'Van', 'Ark']",Dallas:S14 (DVD)

But I thought the story lines  were wrapped up a little to quickly and neatly compared to the previous ones. From the death of April to all of the family members who just conveniently went on vacation at the same time I felt like the writers were scrambling there at the end to keep it going. Not sure if they ran out of ideas or kept trying to resurrect the show to contine for another season. Why would Miss Ellie leave her beloved family and SF? Why would she not rush home to be with Bobbi when April died? So out of character for her. Also, JR basically just rolled over and played dead when he found out he had another son with Callie, when his eldest one decided to leave the ranch and John Ross left to be with his mother. The JR we all grew to love, and hate,  would never let them go! He would also never have let Ewing Oil go without putting up a fierce fight. We just didn't see that spark with him during this season.

1205642,A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ,B001JAHPXK,Kasey G,"[1, 2]","This final season of the original ""Dallas"" finds the series in a no-win situation on most counts: The only original remaining cast members have turned ""Dallas"" into the J.R./Bobby/Cliff hour and despite the relative newcomers, most of the situations are re-hashed from the glory days long past.Continuing from Season 13, J.R. is still committed to the sanitarium thanks to James, who has plans to seize control of Ewing Oil. There are a few highlights here in the form of humpy Mitch Pileggi (who showed up on the 2012 reboot) as well as a touching scene where J.R. gifts his fellow patients with goodbye presents.Bobby and April's newly-wedded bliss is cut short on a Paris honeymoon when April is abducted by the mysterious Sheila Foley (Susan Lucci) who has plans to force Bobby in assisting her in an International protest that turns into a nightmare. This storyline doesn't get resolved until the very end of the season and you can skip through the entire middle section here without missing much.Even the terrific Kimberly Foster seems more fizzle-than-sizzle this season as most of her scenes are dragged down since she's paired with the lethargic James (Sasha Mitchell).There's a boring plot involving Cliff's new love (Barbara Stock) who has mysterious mob ties, but this just comes across as an inverse of the Sue-Ellen and Nick scenario from Season 11. Barbara Eden's reunion with Larry Hagman here is a little surreal to watch since we can't help but imagine her folding her arms and blinking him onto a spit in their rotisserie oven instead of having her hatch an elaborate revenge plan that lasts a half-dozen episodes.Tellingly, even the characters remark on how empty and static the show has become with J.R. stating how quiet Southfork seems and John-Ross and Christopher chuckling ""Things are finally getting fun around here again"" when they witness a catfight in the pool between Michelle and one of James' one-night-stands.The brief return of Clayton (Howard Keel) is most telling as his bored expression and awkwardness display when he gives the news that Miss Ellie is not returning and has decided to bequeath the ranch to Bobby.It was past the time to lay ""Dallas"" to rest and everything here seems very anti-climactic. For completists only: everyone else should just watch the first few episodes set in Paris and the last three or four. You won't be missing much in between.THREE STARS but still better than the 2012 remake.",3,As Satisfying As a Plate of Cold Leftovers,1365206400,"04 6, 2013",2013,2449,"['final', 'season', 'original', 'Dallas', 'series', 'no-win', 'situation', 'most', 'counts', 'only', 'original', 'remaining', 'cast', 'members', 'have', 'turned', 'Dallas', 'J.R./Bobby/Cliff', 'hour', 'relative', 'newcomers', 'most', 'situations', 'are', 're-hashed', 'glory', 'days', 'long', 'past.Continuing', 'Season', '13', 'J.R.', 'still', 'committed', 'sanitarium', 'thanks', 'James', 'who', 'plans', 'seize', 'control', 'Ewing', 'Oil', 'are', 'few', 'highlights', 'here', 'form', 'humpy', 'Mitch', 'Pileggi', 'who', 'showed', 'up', '2012', 'reboot', 'as', 'well', 'touching', 'scene', 'where', 'J.R.', 'gifts', 'fellow', 'patients', 'goodbye', 'presents.Bobby', 'April', 'newly-wedded', 'bliss', 'cut', 'short', 'Paris', 'honeymoon', 'when', 'April', 'abducted', 'mysterious', 'Sheila', 'Foley', 'Susan', 'Lucci', 'who', 'plans', 'force', 'Bobby', 'assisting', 'International', 'protest', 'nightmare', 'storyline', ""n't"", 'get', 'resolved', 'very', 'end', 'season', 'can', 'skip', 'entire', 'middle', 'section', 'here', 'missing', 'much.Even', 'terrific', 'Kimberly', 'Foster', 'more', 'fizzle-than-sizzle', 'season', 'most', 'scenes', 'are', 'dragged', 'down', 'paired', 'lethargic', 'James', 'Sasha', 'Mitchell', 'boring', 'plot', 'involving', 'Cliff', 'new', 'love', 'Barbara', 'Stock', 'who', 'mysterious', 'mob', 'ties', 'just', 'across', 'inverse', 'Sue-Ellen', 'Nick', 'scenario', 'Season', '11', 'Barbara', 'Eden', 'reunion', 'Larry', 'Hagman', 'here', 'little', 'surreal', 'watch', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'imagine', 'folding', 'arms', 'blinking', 'spit', 'rotisserie', 'oven', 'instead', 'having', 'hatch', 'elaborate', 'revenge', 'plan', 'half-dozen', 'episodes.Tellingly', 'even', 'characters', 'remark', 'how', 'empty', 'static', 'show', 'become', 'J.R.', 'stating', 'how', 'quiet', 'Southfork', 'John-Ross', 'Christopher', 'chuckling', 'Things', 'are', 'finally', 'getting', 'fun', 'around', 'here', 'again', 'when', 'witness', 'catfight', 'pool', 'Michelle', 'one', 'James', 'one-night-stands.The', 'brief', 'return', 'Clayton', 'Howard', 'Keel', 'most', 'telling', 'bored', 'expression', 'awkwardness', 'display', 'when', 'news', 'Miss', 'Ellie', 'not', 'returning', 'decided', 'bequeath', 'ranch', 'Bobby.It', 'was', 'time', 'lay', 'Dallas', 'rest', 'everything', 'here', 'very', 'anti-climactic', 'completists', 'only', 'everyone', 'else', 'should', 'just', 'watch', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'set', 'Paris', 'last', 'three', 'four', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'missing', 'much', 'between.THREE', 'STARS', 'still', 'better', '2012', 'remake']",Dallas:S14 (DVD)

1205644,A23FBI8U8IU5MM,B001JAHPXK,Les G. Solomon,"[1, 3]","There is no doubt that the final season of ""Dallas""is something of a disappointment. A mediocre and at times sad attempt to keep the show going that revs up in moments , then gets lazy and drones down again to the all too irrelevant conclusion. What a shame they could not have brought some of the regulars back for a real final episode instead of this gloomy, silly muddle with Joel Grey. Very few long running series have ever ended well and ""Dallas"" is no exception with a cliff hanger that looked like it would never be resolved until after Larry Hagman thankfully survived  his health problems, was able some years later to return and tie up the loose ends with a TV movie that came close to finishing up in  a way that the final episode could and should have been resolved.Having said all this, there are some fine moments here, the season starts very badly as the producers go to no end of expense and plot contrivance to kill off Sheree Wilson (they couldnt kill her off the season before which ended with her wedding to Bobby)once the crazy and poorly and rather insultingly written Dallas version of ""Cuckoos Nest"" together with the last gasps of Ms Wilson are over, the storyline was quite fine for the next few episodes with the delightful addition  of Barbara Eden. She and Larry have a ball together and their scenes and their plotline is as strong, camp and amusing as anything in the last few years of ""Dallas"" Unfortunately Patrick Duffy's tedious storyline (looking to revenge Ms Wilson's death, didnt he know she wanted to leave!!!??)brings most of the last season down. The addition of Susan Lucci's daughter is slow, tiresome, lacks any sort of sexual spark or dramatic pulse and it goes on and on and on, probably the weakest storyline in the history of the series. Finally in the last few episodes, plots are tied up, actors leave and it all starts to wind down to what should have been a cheery and likeable final couple of episodes (Victoria Principal was going to come back and resolve the Bobby Pam storyline till no one could guarantee to her that this was definitely the final episode)Instead ""Conundrum"" is a trivial, silly, unbelievable version of ""Its a Wonderful Life' that brings the series crashing down in flames. What a wasted opportunity and what a shame the producers could not see it. At least they redeemed themselves much later with ""Jr Returns"", but that could all have been played into the final episode and the series would have ended on a high.",3,It Goes Like It Goes,1297728000,"02 15, 2011",2011,2490,"['doubt', 'final', 'season', 'Dallas', 'something', 'disappointment', 'mediocre', 'times', 'sad', 'attempt', 'keep', 'show', 'going', 'up', 'moments', 'then', 'lazy', 'drones', 'down', 'again', 'too', 'irrelevant', 'conclusion', 'What', 'shame', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'brought', 'regulars', 'back', 'real', 'final', 'episode', 'instead', 'gloomy', 'silly', 'muddle', 'Joel', 'Grey', 'Very', 'few', 'long', 'running', 'series', 'have', 'ever', 'ended', 'well', 'Dallas', 'exception', 'cliff', 'hanger', 'looked', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'resolved', 'Larry', 'Hagman', 'thankfully', 'survived', 'health', 'problems', 'was', 'able', 'years', 'later', 'return', 'tie', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'TV', 'movie', 'came', 'close', 'finishing', 'up', 'way', 'final', 'episode', 'could', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'resolved.Having', 'said', 'are', 'fine', 'moments', 'here', 'season', 'very', 'badly', 'producers', 'go', 'end', 'expense', 'plot', 'contrivance', 'kill', 'off', 'Sheree', 'Wilson', 'couldnt', 'kill', 'off', 'season', 'ended', 'wedding', 'Bobby', 'once', 'crazy', 'poorly', 'rather', 'insultingly', 'written', 'Dallas', 'version', 'Cuckoos', 'Nest', 'together', 'last', 'gasps', 'Ms', 'Wilson', 'are', 'storyline', 'was', 'quite', 'fine', 'next', 'few', 'episodes', 'delightful', 'addition', 'Barbara', 'Eden', 'Larry', 'have', 'ball', 'together', 'scenes', 'plotline', 'strong', 'camp', 'amusing', 'anything', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'Dallas', 'Unfortunately', 'Patrick', 'Duffy', 'tedious', 'storyline', 'looking', 'revenge', 'Ms', 'Wilson', 'death', 'didnt', 'wanted', 'leave', 'most', 'last', 'season', 'down', 'addition', 'Susan', 'Lucci', 'daughter', 'slow', 'tiresome', 'sort', 'sexual', 'spark', 'dramatic', 'pulse', 'probably', 'weakest', 'storyline', 'history', 'series', 'Finally', 'last', 'few', 'episodes', 'plots', 'are', 'tied', 'up', 'actors', 'leave', 'wind', 'down', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'cheery', 'likeable', 'final', 'couple', 'episodes', 'Victoria', 'Principal', 'was', 'going', 'come', 'back', 'resolve', 'Bobby', 'Pam', 'storyline', 'till', 'one', 'could', 'guarantee', 'was', 'definitely', 'final', 'episode', 'Instead', 'Conundrum', 'trivial', 'silly', 'unbelievable', 'version', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'series', 'crashing', 'down', 'flames', 'What', 'wasted', 'opportunity', 'what', 'shame', 'producers', 'could', 'not', 'see', 'least', 'redeemed', 'much', 'later', 'Jr', 'Returns', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'played', 'final', 'episode', 'series', 'would', 'have', 'ended', 'high']",Dallas:S14 (DVD)

Despite the few episodes that stalled things slightly while James Beaumont dissolved his marriage to Michelle, the entire season had a wide range of plot directions and introduced some new characters smoothly enough, (including a warmer and wiser family oriented J.R.), to have been a decent installment in the show's continued success. Of course, it would have been a much different product by then, and ""Old J.R."" would need to be up to his skillfully crafted tricks every so often...but they could have been based in his new desire to rebuild the Ewings as a family unit on South Fork, gaining a stake in the ranch for his sons and his grandson from Bobby, or wrestling Ewing Oil back from Cliff and Michelle. After reading that Season 14 was such a low point for the series that I was surprised by how good it was and I did not find it boring at all. All good things indeed must come to an end, but it didn't seem to me that Season 14 was destined to be 'it' for Dallas at all.
