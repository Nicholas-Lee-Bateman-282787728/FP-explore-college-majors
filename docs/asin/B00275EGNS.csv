I didn't really need to. This film rocked! It was Brett Easton Ellis captured perfectly. I think everyone who hated it either didn't understand it or they just aren't into the author's work. If you haven't seen it, I'll describe it as a dreamy, perhaps inebriated, (chemically induced for sure) look at rich L.A. kids and their parents, who are all under the influence of something, during the early 80's.

That said, I think there is a reason that it's obscure.  It's a difficult movie to categorize;  it's depressing but not necessarily supposed to be as such.  It is certainly a throwback to the 80s and will therefore be somewhat nostalgic for those of us who grew up during that era.LikeCrash (Widescreen Edition), the movie does not really have a plot, per-se.  Instead, there are a bunch of sub-plots which rub against each other.  However, unlike CRASH, where the stories made a seamless whole, to me the disparate stories in this movie made the storyline seem disjointed and a bit chaotic.  There are also disturbing images of violence against women & children which are thrown in for no good reason.Of course, seeing Amber Heard dance around topless is worth several times the price of admission.  Full disclosure:  that was the primary impetus for my picking up this DVD and it did NOT disappoint in that regard.  I've been a HUGE fan of her's ever since watching Nick Cage's potboilerDrive Angry.  Amber is one of the few actresses in Hollywood who is able to make a subpar movie worth your trouble!All in all, this seems to be a movie about spoiled rich kids who get bored with life & their boredom leads to apathy.  On the opposite side of the spectrum are people who are desperate to get a bigger piece of the pie and will not let anything stand in their way ~ including common decency & the law-of-the-land.

This film was based on a collection of short stories by Bret Easton Ellis; at least that explains the several different plot lines that are mostly related only tangentially, even artificially (the Mickey Rourke story seems to belong in a different film altogether, other than the fact that he used to work in the studio which Billy Bob Thornton heads). We are in Bret Easton Ellis (American Psycho) land - LA in the early 1980s, with rich and privileged parents and their rich and privileged kids, all of whom are buff and beautiful, with virtually everyone overindulging in booze, drugs, and sex (hetero-, homo- and bi-) in various combinations and permutations. Since Ellis did the screenplay he has no one to blame but himself for the film's complete lack of focus. The acting ranges from okay to pretty good, with the exception of Billy Bob, who seems to be sleepwalking through the whole film (or is he supposed to be always drugged up?). The film takes place just as AIDS was coming into people's consciousness, and one of the characters, indeed, has obviously contracted the disease, so are we supposed to take this film as a warning of what unchecked hedonism leads to? If so, it doesn't work, because all the characters are so superficial that it is impossible to care about any of them. The Informers (and I guess I'm just not with it, but I have no idea what the title is supposed to mean) might have worked as a collection of individual short stories loosely tied together by a common theme (think of Robert Altman's vastly superior Shirt Cuts), but here, at least, that loose connection just doesn't work cinematically.",2,A Train Wreck,1341964800,"07 11, 2012",2012,1791,"['train-wreck', 'movie', 'only', '1', 'star', 'gave', '2', 'messiness', 'film', 'made', 'least', 'almost', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'film', 'was', 'based', 'collection', 'short', 'stories', 'Bret', 'Easton', 'Ellis', 'least', 'several', 'different', 'plot', 'lines', 'are', 'mostly', 'related', 'only', 'tangentially', 'even', 'artificially', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'story', 'belong', 'different', 'film', 'altogether', 'other', 'fact', 'used', 'work', 'studio', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'heads', 'are', 'Bret', 'Easton', 'Ellis', 'American', 'Psycho', 'land', 'LA', 'early', '1980s', 'rich', 'privileged', 'parents', 'rich', 'privileged', 'kids', 'whom', 'are', 'buff', 'beautiful', 'virtually', 'everyone', 'overindulging', 'booze', 'drugs', 'sex', 'hetero-', 'homo-', 'bi-', 'various', 'combinations', 'permutations', 'Ellis', 'did', 'screenplay', 'one', 'blame', 'film', 'complete', 'lack', 'focus', 'acting', 'ranges', 'okay', 'pretty', 'good', 'exception', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'who', 'be', 'sleepwalking', 'whole', 'film', 'supposed', 'be', 'always', 'drugged', 'up', 'film', 'place', 'just', 'AIDS', 'was', 'coming', 'people', 'consciousness', 'one', 'characters', 'indeed', 'obviously', 'contracted', 'disease', 'so', 'are', 'supposed', 'take', 'film', 'warning', 'what', 'unchecked', 'hedonism', 'so', ""n't"", 'work', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'superficial', 'impossible', 'care', 'Informers', 'guess', ""'m"", 'just', 'not', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'title', 'supposed', 'mean', 'might', 'have', 'worked', 'collection', 'individual', 'short', 'stories', 'loosely', 'tied', 'together', 'common', 'theme', 'think', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'vastly', 'superior', 'Shirt', 'Cuts', 'here', 'least', 'loose', 'connection', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'cinematically']",N/A

1252438,A3TY1C8ZHY5THP,B00275EGNS,"Inept Editor ""TheIneptOwl.com""","[1, 1]","""Adjust my dreams for me."" It's a short phrase, but can be interpreted in so many ways. Some people may find it a lazy request; some may see it as the catch-phrase of drug culture; others may see it as the words of a talented writer telling his future self to change the names, places, and most of the activities of a novel in order to make it even more confusing as a movie.Introducing, The Informers.For better or for worse, ""adjust my dreams for me"" is the main character's cry for salvation from what his life has become in the Bret Easton Ellis book-turned-movie, The Informers. Unfortunately, the rest of the story is so messy that you feel that some of the plot-lines should have been made into short films.In Bret Easton Ellis' book of the same name, you are given a multitude of short story-type chapters, where characters are cross referenced in those chapters and even in other Ellis books. What is created is literary confusion, as most of the characters are part of an elite troupe of the LA scene and, with one exception, everyone is about sex, drugs and rock n' roll. The movie is much like the book, except the names are traded around to make someone like me who has read the book even more confused. Half the time I was watching The Informers, I was pausing and referencing the book to figure out who the hell is who.To summarize, the movie is about a dead playboy, a kid and his estranged drunken father, a separated couple in the midst of faking a reunion, a guy fed up with sleeping around and having his girlfriend sleep around(specifically with the guy's best friend. There's a nifty post-threesome scene), an out of work actor and his convict uncle, and a confused rockstar. The stories interwine with each other throughout the movie as the characters try to find some peace. Or, something. Whatever it is, no one finds it. Not exactly the feel good movie of the year.The acting isn't half-bad. Mickey Rourke steals the show with the minimal screen time he has as Uncle Pete, the loving soul that sells kids into sex slavery, along with since deceased Brad Renfro as an out of work actor trying to do the right thing no matter what the cost. In a better world, this could have been the next Another Day In Paradise, but instead it is just part of The Informers. Billy Bob Thornton and Kim Bassinger play very well as a separated couple trying to patch their life back up. Unfortunately, their story doesn't measure up to what is going on in the rest of the movie.Amber Heard, playing Christie, is naked for half the movie, which is awesome, but her interaction with her boyfriend, Graham, and his best friend are perfect in allowing Graham to get to that point where he's had enough, but just can't seem to break away from the cycle that his life has become. In the final scene of the movie, Graham goes to Christie as she's sick, lying on the beach. The interaction is intense when Graham meets Nina, the woman who called him to get Christie:Graham: ""Why me?""Nina: ""Well aren't you the one that loves her?""Graham: ""What's that gonna fix. Is that gonna help her?""It's not really going to help anyone in this movie, but as a hammer to the head as a realization that these characters will never get out of their own ways, it helps us as the audience, and somewhat saves this movie.The story-line of the rockstar Bryan Metro is so stereotypical it barely makes a dent. Think Trent Reznor rumors right before ""The Downward Spiral"" was released.In fact, the only really bad actor in the movie was Chris Isaak as a drunken father. Sure, he seemed drunk, forcefully, annoyingly drunk. Maybe he really was drunk because his acting was even worse sober. Who knows?So does one actor ruin a movie? No. What killed this movie was  too much content, and not enough depth. Ellis got away with having multiple storylines co-existing. He had a lot of space to play with in the book. But in a movie, we have 2 hours. While it can be done(like in Crash), it needs a distinct story to keep it moving, and a balance of cuts as me are movied from story, and unfortunately, this movie was lacking both of these.I'd go as far as to say that the story of Graham and Christie and the story of Uncle Pete and Jack could easily have been great as short films, or even as feature films. I'd go as far as o say that these two stories could have co-existed together in this film if only the rest of the film was cut.I give this movie 1-1/2 face-palming authors.",2,Better if it were 3 Different Films,1300838400,"03 23, 2011",2011,4454,"['Adjust', 'dreams', 'short', 'phrase', 'can', 'be', 'interpreted', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'people', 'may', 'find', 'lazy', 'request', 'may', 'see', 'catch-phrase', 'drug', 'culture', 'others', 'may', 'see', 'words', 'talented', 'writer', 'telling', 'future', 'self', 'change', 'names', 'places', 'most', 'activities', 'novel', 'order', 'make', 'even', 'more', 'confusing', 'movie.Introducing', 'Informers.For', 'better', 'worse', 'adjust', 'dreams', 'main', 'character', 'cry', 'salvation', 'what', 'life', 'become', 'Bret', 'Easton', 'Ellis', 'book-turned-movie', 'Informers', 'Unfortunately', 'rest', 'story', 'so', 'messy', 'feel', 'plot-lines', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'short', 'films.In', 'Bret', 'Easton', 'Ellis', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'are', 'given', 'multitude', 'short', 'story-type', 'chapters', 'where', 'characters', 'are', 'cross', 'referenced', 'chapters', 'even', 'other', 'Ellis', 'books', 'What', 'created', 'literary', 'confusion', 'most', 'characters', 'are', 'part', 'elite', 'troupe', 'LA', 'scene', 'one', 'exception', 'everyone', 'sex', 'drugs', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'movie', 'much', 'book', 'names', 'are', 'traded', 'make', 'someone', 'who', 'read', 'book', 'even', 'more', 'confused', 'time', 'was', 'watching', 'Informers', 'was', 'pausing', 'referencing', 'book', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'hell', 'who.To', 'summarize', 'movie', 'dead', 'playboy', 'kid', 'estranged', 'drunken', 'father', 'separated', 'couple', 'midst', 'faking', 'reunion', 'guy', 'fed', 'up', 'sleeping', 'around', 'having', 'girlfriend', 'sleep', 'specifically', 'guy', 'best', 'friend', 'nifty', 'post-threesome', 'scene', 'out', 'work', 'actor', 'convict', 'uncle', 'confused', 'rockstar', 'stories', 'interwine', 'other', 'movie', 'characters', 'try', 'find', 'peace', 'something', 'one', 'Not', 'exactly', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'year.The', 'acting', ""n't"", 'half-bad', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'show', 'minimal', 'screen', 'time', 'Uncle', 'Pete', 'loving', 'soul', 'kids', 'sex', 'slavery', 'deceased', 'Brad', 'Renfro', 'work', 'actor', 'trying', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'matter', 'what', 'cost', 'better', 'world', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'next', 'Day', 'Paradise', 'instead', 'just', 'part', 'Informers', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'Kim', 'Bassinger', 'play', 'very', 'well', 'separated', 'couple', 'trying', 'patch', 'life', 'back', 'up', 'Unfortunately', 'story', ""n't"", 'measure', 'up', 'what', 'going', 'rest', 'movie.Amber', 'Heard', 'playing', 'Christie', 'naked', 'movie', 'awesome', 'interaction', 'boyfriend', 'Graham', 'best', 'friend', 'are', 'perfect', 'allowing', 'Graham', 'get', 'point', 'where', 'had', 'enough', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'break', 'away', 'cycle', 'life', 'become', 'final', 'scene', 'movie', 'Graham', 'Christie', 'sick', 'lying', 'beach', 'interaction', 'intense', 'when', 'Graham', 'Nina', 'woman', 'who', 'called', 'get', 'Christie', 'Graham', 'Why', 'Nina', 'Well', 'are', ""n't"", 'one', 'Graham', 'What', 'gon', 'fix', 'gon', 'help', 'not', 'really', 'going', 'help', 'anyone', 'movie', 'hammer', 'head', 'realization', 'characters', 'will', 'never', 'get', 'own', 'ways', 'audience', 'somewhat', 'movie.The', 'story-line', 'rockstar', 'Bryan', 'Metro', 'so', 'stereotypical', 'barely', 'dent', 'Think', 'Trent', 'Reznor', 'rumors', 'right', 'Downward', 'Spiral', 'was', 'released.In', 'fact', 'only', 'really', 'bad', 'actor', 'movie', 'was', 'Chris', 'Isaak', 'drunken', 'father', 'Sure', 'seemed', 'drunk', 'forcefully', 'annoyingly', 'drunk', 'Maybe', 'really', 'was', 'drunk', 'acting', 'was', 'even', 'worse', 'sober', 'Who', 'So', 'one', 'actor', 'movie', 'No', 'What', 'killed', 'movie', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'content', 'not', 'enough', 'depth', 'Ellis', 'got', 'away', 'having', 'multiple', 'storylines', 'co-existing', 'had', 'lot', 'space', 'play', 'book', 'movie', 'have', '2', 'hours', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'Crash', 'distinct', 'story', 'keep', 'moving', 'balance', 'cuts', 'are', 'movied', 'story', 'unfortunately', 'movie', 'was', 'lacking', 'these.I', ""'d"", 'go', 'as', 'far', 'say', 'story', 'Graham', 'Christie', 'story', 'Uncle', 'Pete', 'Jack', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'short', 'films', 'even', 'feature', 'films', ""'d"", 'go', 'as', 'far', 'o', 'say', 'two', 'stories', 'could', 'have', 'co-existed', 'together', 'film', 'only', 'rest', 'film', 'was', 'cut.I', 'give', 'movie', '1-1/2', 'face-palming', 'authors']",N/A

1252440,A3CM1985CV46CD,B00275EGNS,John Ashley Nail,"[2, 2]","In glamorous L.A. during the early 1980s, bisexual drug dealer Graham (Jon Foster, this generation's Andrew McCarthy) thinks he might be in love with his girlfriend (Amber Heard), even while his girlfriend seems to be spending more time with their man-wh*re pal Martin, who sometimes joins the couple for three-ways. Graham's dad (Billy Bob Thornton), a studio exec, wants to get back together with Graham's mother but he can't quit his neurotic newscaster mistress (Winona Ryder, looking surprisingly frumpy as the other woman). Graham's mother (Kim Basinger) doesn't seem to know what she wants but she's sure she doesn't want to get back with her husband, instead whiling away her days in a medicated fog, occasionally breaking up the monotony of her existence with some afternoon sexing from Martin. In addition to Graham's screwed up family you have a boozy skirt chaser (Chris Isaak) trying -- and failing -- to bond with his son during a trip to Hawaii; a wasted rock star (Mel Raido) wreaking sexual havoc while on tour in L.A.; and, on the other side of the tracks, Brad Renfro, in his final film, as a pathetic doorman whose life becomes a whole lot more desperate when his criminal uncle (Mickey Rourke, almost upstaged by facial hair that resembles a fungal growth) shows up at his house with a teen girlfriend and kidnapped boy in tow.Just from reading those story elements one might think ""The Informers"" is based on a Burt Hirschfeld novel. If only. Instead, the movie is based on a book of stories by Bret Easton Ellis, which means all this debauchery is slathered with generous helpings of self-loathing and ennui. Though not a sequel to Ellis' debut novel ""Less than Zero,"" the movie could just as easily be titled, ""Less than Zero 3: The Informers"" (""Less than Zero 2"" would be ""Rules of Attraction"").Slickly directed by Gregor Jordan, ""The Informers'"" disjointed narrative, with all its sex, drugs and sleaze, should be more intriguing than it is. Supposedly this is satire, but it's a decidedly unfunny one. Parents are self-absorbed and immature; their neglected children are bored sociopaths. To say these characters are lost souls would imply they have souls to lose. Only Brad Refro's doorman seems to have any humanity, though to be fair Graham appears to at least *wish* he had feelings. In lieu of emotions, most characters in ""The Informers"" settle for sensations, be they from lines of cocaine or passionless sex (for all the beautiful naked bodies in this movie, the sex scenes are about as arousing as a deodorant commercial). It's telling that the only display of pure joy in the movie is when Graham makes a drug delivery to a music video shoot.""The Informers"" isn't a bad movie so much as it's a pointless and dreary one. By the time I reached the final credits I felt as dead inside as its characters. It's a shame the vampire story thread from Ellis' book didn't make it into the movie; the actual undead might have livened up this parade of walking corpses.",2,"Sex, Drugs and Self-loathing",1359504000,"01 30, 2013",2013,2995,"['glamorous', 'L.A.', 'early', '1980s', 'bisexual', 'drug', 'dealer', 'Graham', 'Jon', 'Foster', 'generation', 'Andrew', 'McCarthy', 'might', 'be', 'love', 'girlfriend', 'Amber', 'Heard', 'even', 'girlfriend', 'be', 'spending', 'more', 'time', 'man-wh*re', 'pal', 'Martin', 'who', 'sometimes', 'couple', 'three-ways', 'Graham', 'dad', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'studio', 'exec', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'Graham', 'mother', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quit', 'neurotic', 'newscaster', 'mistress', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'looking', 'surprisingly', 'frumpy', 'other', 'woman', 'Graham', 'mother', 'Kim', 'Basinger', ""n't"", 'seem', 'know', 'what', 'sure', ""n't"", 'want', 'get', 'back', 'husband', 'instead', 'whiling', 'away', 'days', 'medicated', 'fog', 'occasionally', 'breaking', 'up', 'monotony', 'existence', 'afternoon', 'sexing', 'Martin', 'addition', 'Graham', 'screwed', 'up', 'family', 'have', 'boozy', 'skirt', 'chaser', 'Chris', 'Isaak', 'trying', 'failing', 'bond', 'son', 'trip', 'Hawaii', 'wasted', 'rock', 'star', 'Mel', 'Raido', 'wreaking', 'sexual', 'havoc', 'tour', 'L.A.', 'other', 'side', 'tracks', 'Brad', 'Renfro', 'final', 'film', 'pathetic', 'doorman', 'life', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'desperate', 'when', 'criminal', 'uncle', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'almost', 'upstaged', 'facial', 'hair', 'fungal', 'growth', 'up', 'house', 'teen', 'girlfriend', 'kidnapped', 'boy', 'tow.Just', 'reading', 'story', 'elements', 'one', 'might', 'think', 'Informers', 'based', 'Burt', 'Hirschfeld', 'novel', 'only', 'Instead', 'movie', 'based', 'book', 'stories', 'Bret', 'Easton', 'Ellis', 'debauchery', 'slathered', 'generous', 'helpings', 'self-loathing', 'ennui', 'not', 'sequel', 'Ellis', 'debut', 'Less', 'Zero', 'movie', 'could', 'just', 'easily', 'be', 'titled', 'Less', 'Zero', '3', 'Informers', 'Less', 'Zero', '2', 'would', 'be', 'Rules', 'Attraction', '.Slickly', 'directed', 'Gregor', 'Jordan', 'Informers', 'disjointed', 'narrative', 'sex', 'drugs', 'sleaze', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'intriguing', 'Supposedly', 'satire', 'decidedly', 'unfunny', 'one', 'Parents', 'are', 'self-absorbed', 'immature', 'neglected', 'children', 'are', 'bored', 'sociopaths', 'say', 'characters', 'are', 'lost', 'souls', 'would', 'imply', 'have', 'souls', 'lose', 'Only', 'Brad', 'Refro', 'doorman', 'have', 'humanity', 'be', 'fair', 'Graham', 'least', '*wish*', 'had', 'feelings', 'lieu', 'emotions', 'most', 'characters', 'Informers', 'settle', 'sensations', 'be', 'lines', 'cocaine', 'passionless', 'sex', 'beautiful', 'naked', 'bodies', 'movie', 'sex', 'scenes', 'are', 'as', 'arousing', 'deodorant', 'commercial', 'telling', 'only', 'display', 'pure', 'joy', 'movie', 'when', 'Graham', 'drug', 'delivery', 'music', 'video', 'shoot', 'Informers', ""n't"", 'bad', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'pointless', 'dreary', 'one', 'time', 'reached', 'final', 'credits', 'felt', 'dead', 'characters', 'shame', 'vampire', 'story', 'thread', 'Ellis', 'book', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'movie', 'actual', 'undead', 'might', 'have', 'livened', 'up', 'parade', 'walking', 'corpses']",N/A
1252441,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B00275EGNS,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[3, 5]","The Informers is based on a novel by Bret Easton Ellis, the novelist behind the book American Psycho. I don't pretend to be familiar with Ellis' work, as I've never read a book by the man and I've only seen two film adaptations of his work. One was American Psycho, the other The Rules of Attraction. The Informers is the first film adaptation that Ellis had a hand in, co-writing the script with Nicholas Jarecki. It's a period piece of sorts, set in Los Angeles in 1983 among the Hollywood scene. It's got an all-around reliable cast including Billy Bob Thornton, Kim Basinger, Mickey Rourke, Winona Ryder, Rhys Ifans, and the late Brad Renfro...How can this be a bad film? Well, it's not...But it's not a very good one either.The time frame this movie takes place in is a very decadent time. In the opening scene, we meet a few of the main characters at a party. They're all engaged in drinking, sex, and soon one of their friends is struck by a vehicle and killed. At his funeral, only one of his friends reacts and the others seem indifferent. ""Bruce was an [...],"" says one character. This is a film filled with character's that are indifferent to their lives and the world as a whole. Graham (Jon Foster) is the son of studio head William (Thornton) and Laura (Basinger), who just lounges around her home occasionally having sex with Graham's friend Martin (Austin Nichols). It's not uncommon for Graham to wake up next to his girlfriend Christie (Amber Heard) and Martin. Meanwhile Jackson (Renfro), an aspiring actor and hotel courtesy clerk, is confronted by his Uncle Pete (Rourke), a despicable man who tells Jackson he has a plan and doesn't allow Jackson to object.The film has interweaving storylines, obviously, including one about a drugged-out rock star Bryan Metro (Mel Raido) and one of Graham's friends Tim Price (Lou Taylor Pucci) who is forced to travel to Hawaii with his estranged father (Chris Isaak), who frequently asks him if he's gay. When Tim actually meets a girl there, his father hits on her.It runs a mere 98 minutes and has too many storylines going to really do any of them justice. Apparently, the original novel had more (including one with vampires), but a novel's a novel. The film simply doesn't really flesh out any of these character's nor does its running time allow it enough time to do so...And, as many people have mentioned already, the characters are not sympathetic. The performances here are good all around, but none of the character's have any depth for the actor to work with. The only sympathetic character here is Jackson and the performance by Renfro makes one realize how tragic a loss this was for movies. Renfro plays Jackson as a troubled young man, afraid of his Uncle Pete and the man's actions...This character doesn't seem like a deep, multi-layered character but it's not an easy part to play. Watch the scene where Jackson tries to tell the blonde man who arrives at his apartment that he doesn't know what the man is talking about. That's acting, folks.As I said, the performances are good here but not a single one (except Renfro's) really makes any connection with the audience. Without feeling something for the characters, you don't really care what happens to them. This complaint of mine goes along with other's complaint about the abrupt ending...It does end abruptly, with little optimism for anyone involved. This didn't bother me very much, but it would've been much less bothersome if the character's had been fleshed out before the ending. While I don't want to exclude Basinger and Thornton, Mickey Rourke is fun to watch here. I love Rourke and I always enjoy seeing him play the sweaty, charismatic-in-a-dirty-way character with his hair lazily slicked back. Rourke has that charisma that he mixes with subtle threatening overtones. It's nothing Award-worthy, but a fun performance.The film does capture the `80s vibe very well and credit should be given to director Gregor Jordan for capturing an era that isn't the easiest to capture on film without going into self-parody territory. I would not call The Informers a waste of time, but the poor characterization and predictable dialogue (there's some dialogue in this film where you know exactly what the character's are going to say to each other) bog it down. It's certainly not ""one of the worst movie's of this or any year"" as Peter Travers branded it.My advice to you is approach The Informers without expecting American Psycho or a masterpiece. The Informers is entertaining enough; it'll pass the time, but it's nothing special nor is it anything memorable.GRADE: C+",3,Here to Inform You: This Isn't a Horrible Movie,1255305600,"10 12, 2009",2009,4609,"['Informers', 'based', 'novel', 'Bret', 'Easton', 'Ellis', 'novelist', 'book', 'American', 'Psycho', 'do', ""n't"", 'pretend', 'be', 'familiar', 'Ellis', 'work', ""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'book', 'man', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'two', 'film', 'adaptations', 'work', 'One', 'was', 'American', 'Psycho', 'other', 'Rules', 'Attraction', 'Informers', 'first', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Ellis', 'had', 'hand', 'co-writing', 'script', 'Nicholas', 'Jarecki', 'period', 'piece', 'sorts', 'set', 'Los', 'Angeles', '1983', 'Hollywood', 'scene', 'got', 'all-around', 'reliable', 'cast', 'including', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'Rhys', 'Ifans', 'late', 'Brad', 'Renfro', 'How', 'can', 'be', 'bad', 'film', 'Well', 'not', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'either.The', 'time', 'frame', 'movie', 'place', 'very', 'decadent', 'time', 'opening', 'scene', 'meet', 'few', 'main', 'characters', 'party', ""'re"", 'engaged', 'drinking', 'sex', 'soon', 'one', 'friends', 'struck', 'vehicle', 'killed', 'funeral', 'only', 'one', 'friends', 'reacts', 'others', 'seem', 'indifferent', 'Bruce', 'was', '[', ']', 'one', 'character', 'film', 'filled', 'character', 'are', 'indifferent', 'lives', 'world', 'whole', 'Graham', 'Jon', 'Foster', 'son', 'studio', 'head', 'William', 'Thornton', 'Laura', 'Basinger', 'who', 'just', 'around', 'home', 'occasionally', 'having', 'sex', 'Graham', 'friend', 'Martin', 'Austin', 'Nichols', 'not', 'uncommon', 'Graham', 'wake', 'up', 'next', 'girlfriend', 'Christie', 'Amber', 'Heard', 'Martin', 'Meanwhile', 'Jackson', 'Renfro', 'aspiring', 'actor', 'hotel', 'courtesy', 'clerk', 'confronted', 'Uncle', 'Pete', 'Rourke', 'despicable', 'man', 'who', 'Jackson', 'plan', ""n't"", 'allow', 'Jackson', 'object.The', 'film', 'interweaving', 'storylines', 'obviously', 'including', 'one', 'drugged-out', 'rock', 'star', 'Bryan', 'Metro', 'Mel', 'Raido', 'one', 'Graham', 'friends', 'Tim', 'Price', 'Lou', 'Taylor', 'Pucci', 'who', 'forced', 'travel', 'Hawaii', 'estranged', 'father', 'Chris', 'Isaak', 'who', 'frequently', 'gay', 'When', 'Tim', 'actually', 'girl', 'there', 'father', 'hits', 'her.It', 'mere', '98', 'minutes', 'too', 'many', 'storylines', 'going', 'really', 'do', 'justice', 'Apparently', 'original', 'novel', 'had', 'more', 'including', 'one', 'vampires', 'novel', 'novel', 'film', 'simply', ""n't"", 'really', 'flesh', 'out', 'character', 'running', 'time', 'enough', 'time', 'do', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'mentioned', 'already', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'sympathetic', 'performances', 'here', 'are', 'good', 'none', 'character', 'have', 'depth', 'actor', 'work', 'only', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'here', 'Jackson', 'performance', 'Renfro', 'one', 'realize', 'how', 'tragic', 'loss', 'was', 'movies', 'Renfro', 'Jackson', 'troubled', 'young', 'man', 'afraid', 'Uncle', 'Pete', 'man', 'actions', 'character', ""n't"", 'seem', 'deep', 'multi-layered', 'character', 'not', 'easy', 'part', 'play', 'Watch', 'scene', 'where', 'Jackson', 'tell', 'blonde', 'man', 'who', 'apartment', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'man', 'talking', 'acting', 'folks.As', 'said', 'performances', 'are', 'good', 'here', 'not', 'single', 'one', 'Renfro', 'really', 'connection', 'audience', 'feeling', 'something', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'what', 'complaint', 'mine', 'along', 'other', 'complaint', 'abrupt', 'ending', 'end', 'abruptly', 'little', 'optimism', 'anyone', 'involved', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'very', 'much', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'much', 'less', 'bothersome', 'character', 'had', 'been', 'fleshed', 'out', 'ending', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'exclude', 'Basinger', 'Thornton', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'fun', 'watch', 'here', 'love', 'Rourke', 'always', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'play', 'sweaty', 'charismatic-in-a-dirty-way', 'character', 'hair', 'lazily', 'slicked', 'back', 'Rourke', 'charisma', 'subtle', 'threatening', 'overtones', 'nothing', 'Award-worthy', 'fun', 'performance.The', 'film', 'capture', '80s', 'vibe', 'very', 'well', 'credit', 'should', 'be', 'given', 'director', 'Gregor', 'Jordan', 'capturing', 'era', ""n't"", 'easiest', 'capture', 'film', 'going', 'self-parody', 'territory', 'would', 'not', 'call', 'Informers', 'waste', 'time', 'poor', 'characterization', 'predictable', 'dialogue', 'dialogue', 'film', 'where', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'character', 'are', 'going', 'say', 'other', 'down', 'certainly', 'not', 'one', 'worst', 'movie', 'year', 'Peter', 'Travers', 'branded', 'it.My', 'advice', 'approach', 'Informers', 'expecting', 'American', 'Psycho', 'masterpiece', 'Informers', 'entertaining', 'enough', ""'ll"", 'pass', 'time', 'nothing', 'special', 'anything', 'memorable.GRADE', 'C+']",N/A

1252444,A1WBJZ4DXQCM14,B00275EGNS,"Kirby L. Wallace ""kirby at  wallaceinfo dee-o...","[18, 20]","As I began watching this movie, the immeidate parallel that I drew was ""Less Than Zero.""  I didn't know until it was over, and googled the cast, that I found out that it was written by the same guy.  Very similar in mood.In fact, I think the mood is more the point of the movie than anything else, and in that respect I can testify for it's accurate portrayal since I was exactly the age of characters at exactly that time.  The dress, the look, the ""searching"", the feel of opulent loneliness, or exquisite desperation...  It really did feel exactly like that in the early to mid eighties club scene.Others have criticized the story line for being shallow, but hey, we were shallow.  There were a couple of places that I thought seemed a bit ""contrived"", but even those mirrored some of my own sentiments from that time.  I'm speaking of one instance where two of the guys are talking, and one of them is beginning to question his lifestyle and the other is definately not.  He begins talking how he needs ""someone to tell him what's right and what's wrong..."" and I'm thinking, ""Well, that came out of nowhere...""  But when I look back, I did a lot of the same questioning myself, after coming home from a night on the beach clubs.The movie is a series of pretty much independent character stories, in the same sort of vein as ""Crash"", but without the obviously clear connections between all the characters.  They seem less connected to each other than in Crash.  I'm not sure what Renfro's and Rourke's characters had to do with anything, though, and that whole plot line could  have been dropped from the movie entirely with no sense of loss at all.  Not sure what they were there for other than to perhaps lend a hand to the feeling of depression which I think this movie is intentionally trying to create.  Same for Bassingers and Thornton's character line.In fact, so independent are the stories from each other that you could drop almost any of them with no noticeable impact.  The movie is the sum total of it's parts, but the sum would certainly be a bit less with any of them missing.  Altogether, they create an ""air"" of emptiness, loathing and desperation that really were the mood of 80's nightlife.  ""To Live and Die in LA"" has the same sort of grittiness to it.What will help you survive this movie is to look at it differently than you are accustomed to. If you go in expecting the characters introduced at the beginning are going to be redeemed by the end, you will be disappointed.  If you expect this to be a movie where all the knots are untangled by the end, where the rough edges are made smooth, the dillemas resolved, and harsh reality eased and made more bearable... you will be disappointed.  This movie goes the other way and makes the smooth edges rough - the closing scene is particularly jagged.Also of note is the soundtrack.  It includes a lot of the ""big names"", but it's nice to see a movie about the 80s that doesn't neglect to remind you that there was lots of music on the scene other than ""Flock of Seagulls"".  The soundtrack includes a lot of the other 99% of songs that never really made it to the Top Ten.  This has the effect of intensifying the feeling of authenticity.  You recall the music being like that, but not necessarily who did it.  And that's the way 80's music really was.  It was ubiquitous yet largely unknown; extremely transient.  The only thing I can think of conspicuously missing is any reference to Miami Vice, although a character in the opening scene is dressed much like Don Johnson just before he gets killed.SPOILER!The sex is gratuitous and I could have done with less - a LOT less, in fact.  But I think it may have been made excessive, but not specifically gratuiotous.  I think there was a reason: it was to make a very hard impact on the closing scene.  The dying Christie, laying on a cold, sunless beach, pale, ravaged now with AIDS.  And on her pale, bruised covered thigh, a fly lands and crawls about for a while, while her former lover looks at her.  This is the same beautiful body we were seeing before, now only weeks later cold and nearly dead with flies crawling on it.

Plot spoilers.Short Attention Span Summary:1. The movie opens with someone being hit by a car. No explanation.2. Later on, we see people engaged in various sexual acts. There is a Decadent Rock Star that seems to have sex with anything that moves (of either sex). At one point, he wakes up in bed with two teenagers and calls the security guards to get them out of his bed.3. Later still, a Bad Guy (Mickey Rourke) looks up his brother/ friend/ acquaintance (he has with him some strung out girl that is tagging along). The Bad Guy kidnaps a child to sell him to some people who plan to do some ungodly things (we are never clear on who the people are or what they plan to do).4. Some woman who is in some relationship with some person/ people apparently has HIV (this is before they quite knew what the disease was-- so it is only hinted at). Eventually her lover meets her laying on the beach (not lucid) and kisses her and leaves here there.5. The Decadent Rock Star one night comes back to his hotel room to find his wife sitting there. He kisses her then punches her. We are later told that someone is holding his wife hostage with a gun (and presumably it is Decadent Rock Star), but this plot line was never resolved or explained in any way during the movie.6. There is some young man in some bad relationship with his father. The young man finds women and his father steals them from him. There is some type of hostility in the relationship, but we don't know its genesis.7. There is some diabetic husband (Thornton) that has a wife that is strung out on prescription medication (Basinger) that he wants to come back to him (all the while having a piece on the side).Review: I honestly just don't know what this movie is about. Even in the worst case scenario of movies (I've seen a lot of bad movies), I can say that the movie will be worth it if it goes onto the dollar shelf. But this movie isn't even that promising (because you would have to spend the time that it took to go get it).The plots overlapped, but were not developed. For that matter, they seemed to start in the middle of the story and just run until the movie ended, with no resolution. (And any one of these subplots, taken on its own and developed, could have made a good film that showcased the Decadent 80s.) Perhaps there were some plot details that were too esoteric for most viewers to get. But after it was all said and done, I just ended up confused.This movie is awful. Save your time. The single best part was the shocking hairstyles that were in vogue in the 80s. But we can look at any VH1 I Love the 80s to see the same thing for free-- and even hear a good song or two while snickering at the hairstyles.",1,WTF was this about?,1253404800,"09 20, 2009",2009,2808,"['Short', 'Attention', 'Span', 'Summary', 'will', 'seem', 'bit', 'disconnected', 'movie', 'was', 'same', 'way', 'Plot', 'spoilers.Short', 'Attention', 'Span', 'Summary:1', 'movie', 'someone', 'being', 'hit', 'car', 'explanation.2', 'Later', 'see', 'people', 'engaged', 'various', 'sexual', 'acts', 'Decadent', 'Rock', 'Star', 'have', 'sex', 'anything', 'sex', 'one', 'point', 'up', 'bed', 'two', 'teenagers', 'security', 'guards', 'get', 'bed.3', 'Later', 'still', 'Bad', 'Guy', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'up', 'brother/', 'friend/', 'acquaintance', 'strung', 'out', 'girl', 'tagging', 'along', 'Bad', 'Guy', 'child', 'sell', 'people', 'who', 'plan', 'do', 'ungodly', 'things', 'are', 'never', 'clear', 'who', 'people', 'are', 'what', 'plan', 'do', '.4', 'woman', 'who', 'relationship', 'person/', 'people', 'apparently', 'HIV', 'quite', 'knew', 'what', 'disease', 'was', 'only', 'hinted', 'Eventually', 'lover', 'laying', 'beach', 'not', 'lucid', 'here', 'there.5', 'Decadent', 'Rock', 'Star', 'one', 'night', 'back', 'hotel', 'room', 'find', 'wife', 'sitting', 'there', 'then', 'are', 'later', 'told', 'someone', 'holding', 'wife', 'hostage', 'gun', 'presumably', 'Decadent', 'Rock', 'Star', 'plot', 'line', 'was', 'never', 'resolved', 'explained', 'way', 'movie.6', 'young', 'man', 'bad', 'relationship', 'father', 'young', 'man', 'women', 'father', 'steals', 'type', 'hostility', 'relationship', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'genesis.7', 'diabetic', 'husband', 'Thornton', 'wife', 'strung', 'out', 'prescription', 'medication', 'Basinger', 'come', 'back', 'while', 'having', 'piece', 'side', '.Review', 'honestly', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'movie', 'Even', 'worst', 'case', 'scenario', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'bad', 'movies', 'can', 'say', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'dollar', 'shelf', 'movie', ""n't"", 'even', 'promising', 'would', 'have', 'spend', 'time', 'took', 'go', 'get', 'plots', 'overlapped', 'were', 'not', 'developed', 'matter', 'seemed', 'start', 'middle', 'story', 'just', 'run', 'movie', 'ended', 'resolution', 'one', 'subplots', 'taken', 'own', 'developed', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'good', 'film', 'showcased', 'Decadent', '80s', 'Perhaps', 'were', 'plot', 'details', 'were', 'too', 'esoteric', 'most', 'viewers', 'get', 'was', 'said', 'done', 'just', 'ended', 'up', 'confused.This', 'movie', 'awful', 'Save', 'time', 'single', 'best', 'part', 'was', 'shocking', 'hairstyles', 'were', 'vogue', '80s', 'can', 'look', 'VH1', 'Love', '80s', 'see', 'same', 'thing', 'free', 'even', 'hear', 'good', 'song', 'two', 'snickering', 'hairstyles']",N/A

Also on the plate here are an empty-souled rock star (Mel Raido), a distant father (Chris Isaak) and son (Lou Taylor Pucci), and a lonely belhop (Brad Renfro in his final film role) caught in a dangerous web with his amoral, ex-con uncle (Mickey Rourke).  While there is certainly to truly enjoy in The Informers, what the film does manage to accomplish is being an accurate enough adaptation of Ellis' own novel.

The daughter - Susan Sloan - is supposed to be providing the only moral voice of this dysfunctional group - but she is so annoying I found her to be sort of disposable. The talent of Billy Bob Thornton and Kim Basinger are almost completely wasted in these roles, as is Wynona Ryder.3) Mickey Rourke as ""Peter"" in an absolutely pointless kidnapping and ransom subplot whose only tie to the previous two is as a hotel attendant at Christy's apartment (what's his name? who cares....).  I cannot for the life of me figure out why this plot is even part of this movie.  Maybe the book makes that more clear - I don't know.4) Another pointless subplot about a debauched rock star with an estranged wife and kid who snorts coke (in a movie like this.... who doesn't?) abandons his band in the middle of a concert (nobody notices) and hops into bed with 2 underage groupies.  His tie to the rest of the movie?  The estranged wife is friends with Christy - apparently....5) A father (played by Chris Isaak - another wasted talent) tries to make amends to his son by taking him to Hawaii for some sun & fun.  In what promises to be another uplifting moment, the son tells the father that there is no chance for him to earn his forgiveness for some crime that goes unspecified.  The son is friends with Graham.Whatever this movie was intended to be, it comes across instead as a patchwork of messy situations that are a joyless for us to experience as they are for the characters.  It seems that by assembling an all-star cast and putting together a great soundtrack, the producers were hoping that they could overcome the movie's less logical elements through sheer stylistic determination, but they fail dreadfully.What you have here instead is nothing more or less than a car crash that ends with (spoiler alert - for those who have no predictive capabilities) one of the main characters dying with aids.  When the end credits started to role, the only thing on my mind was the question of why they made this movie as it offers nothing new to the genre - essentially a form of pornography for those obsessed with misery brought on by moral depravity.If you're looking for movies about the horrific results of excess through the eternal search for short-term gratification, here are a few superior alternatives I could suggest off the top of my head -1) Requiem for a dream - just as depressing but infinitely more true.2) Trainspotting3) Kids4) Blow",2,A pointless display of self-destructive excess which leaves little to ponder,1303516800,"04 23, 2011",2011,3235,"['have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'movie', 'based', 'feelings', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'summed', 'up', 'following', 'statement', 'reason', 'watch', 'movie.Sure', 'are', 'nice', 'things', 'good', 'soundtrack', 'authentic', '80', 'look', 'entertaining', 'party', 'sequences.But', 'then', 'bad', '-5', 'subplots', 'are', 'only', 'loosely', 'tied', 'together', 'seem', 'contrived', 'give', '5', 'different', 'views', 'wretched', 'excess', 'point.1', 'drug-dealing', 'college', 'protagonist', 'Graham', 'Sloan', 'sexy', 'more', 'not', 'topless', 'girlfriend', 'Christy', 'who', 'sleeping', 'friend', 'Martin', 'who', 'Graham', 'also', 'sleeping', '2', 'William', 'Laura', 'Sloan', 'Graham', 'parents', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'reunite', 'family', 'William', 'actively', 'lusting', 'old', 'mistress', 'Cheryl', 'Moore', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'daughter', 'Susan', 'Sloan', 'supposed', 'be', 'providing', 'only', 'moral', 'voice', 'dysfunctional', 'group', 'so', 'annoying', 'found', 'be', 'sort', 'disposable', 'talent', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'are', 'almost', 'completely', 'wasted', 'roles', 'Wynona', 'Ryder.3', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'Peter', 'absolutely', 'pointless', 'kidnapping', 'ransom', 'subplot', 'only', 'previous', 'two', 'hotel', 'attendant', 'Christy', 'apartment', 'what', 'name', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'life', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'plot', 'even', 'part', 'movie', 'Maybe', 'book', 'more', 'clear', 'do', ""n't"", 'know.4', 'pointless', 'subplot', 'debauched', 'rock', 'star', 'estranged', 'wife', 'kid', 'who', 'coke', 'movie', 'who', ""n't"", 'band', 'middle', 'concert', 'nobody', 'notices', 'bed', '2', 'underage', 'groupies', 'tie', 'rest', 'movie', 'estranged', 'wife', 'friends', 'Christy', 'apparently', 'father', 'played', 'Chris', 'Isaak', 'wasted', 'talent', 'make', 'amends', 'son', 'taking', 'Hawaii', 'sun', 'fun', 'what', 'be', 'uplifting', 'moment', 'son', 'father', 'chance', 'earn', 'forgiveness', 'crime', 'unspecified', 'son', 'friends', 'Graham.Whatever', 'movie', 'was', 'intended', 'be', 'across', 'instead', 'patchwork', 'messy', 'situations', 'are', 'joyless', 'experience', 'are', 'characters', 'assembling', 'all-star', 'cast', 'putting', 'together', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'producers', 'were', 'hoping', 'could', 'overcome', 'movie', 'less', 'logical', 'elements', 'sheer', 'stylistic', 'determination', 'fail', 'have', 'here', 'instead', 'nothing', 'more', 'less', 'car', 'crash', 'spoiler', 'alert', 'who', 'have', 'predictive', 'capabilities', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'dying', 'aids', 'When', 'end', 'credits', 'started', 'role', 'only', 'thing', 'mind', 'was', 'question', 'why', 'made', 'movie', 'nothing', 'new', 'genre', 'essentially', 'form', 'pornography', 'obsessed', 'misery', 'brought', 'moral', 'depravity.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'movies', 'horrific', 'results', 'excess', 'eternal', 'search', 'short-term', 'gratification', 'here', 'are', 'few', 'superior', 'alternatives', 'could', 'suggest', 'off', 'top', 'head', '-1', 'Requiem', 'dream', 'just', 'depressing', 'infinitely', 'more', 'true.2', 'Trainspotting3', 'Kids4', 'Blow']",N/A

There has definitely been a split view out there on how good or bad this story worked in the 98 minutes it was given, and admittedly I felt a little shorted when the credits suddenly appeared. But as a Blu product, this did quite well.The picture quality throughout was excellent, the night footage showed no grain in any sequence and the overhead city shots were succinct. There was only one sequence of sunlight bleeding the lens, otherwise all of the green screen shots were competent (and only after watching the making-of did I realize there were a few extra CGI shots I missed). There was such clean depth to the flesh tones (and there is a lot of flesh in this), that the make-up caking and flaws were unfortunately obvious. As a whole though, I loved watching a great clean picture. As always for a music laden film, I would have preferred DTS, but the TrueHD thumped through adequately and often - and I loved the music choices.The main supplement is a 15 minute making-of that has some candid material from the cast and crew, and helped highlight some interesting film making tidbits (most of the film was in Uruguay, Billy Bob would not go there to film, the CGI/green screen usages, and so on). The commentary has Jordan's monologue plus two of the younger cast but he dominates the discussions with some good material.The performances were filled with believable and some more solid than other attempts, and for it being Renfro's last film (died a week later) he showcased a fitting role to that end. For the most part I liked what everyone did, but there just was not enough time for any one role to stand up and take center stage (would have liked to see Chris Isaak and Mickey Rourke a bit more, but with 14 characters being covered, I now realize the much sought after extra forty minute version would be worth the time). Three and a half for the film and Blu clarity, 1/2 for the supplements, but once those credits popped up in that sudden last scene, I could not give it a five.EDIT: One last thing I remembered, is that this film is actually represented perfectly by the red band trailer - and so few film trailers are accurate to the actual film.

Compounding this lack of intrigue is a storyline that is all introduction and setup, leaving the audience waiting for a third act that never comes. The Informers does dissect many of the clich&eacute;s of the classes, but for all the sex, drugs, and rock `n' roll, there's still an overwhelming tediousness to such futile redemptions.Multiple lives are explored during the early `80s, from the rich and famous to the desperate and despondent, all stripped bare by the unglamorous addiction to perpetual self-destruction. William (Billy Bob Thornton) is a powerful movie producer unfaithful to his equally adulterous wife Laura (Kim Basinger), and fickle in his decision to reunite with her as he pines for newscaster Cheryl (Winona Ryder). Their son Graham (Jon Foster) endlessly parties with his girlfriend Christie (Amber Heard) and their mutual friend Martin (Austin Nichols), though he is first to realize the loss of intimacy in their flagrant promiscuity. Lead singer of popular rock band The Informers, Bryan Metro's (Mel Raido) constant indulgence in mind-shattering decadency has all but eradicated his sense of morality. Tim (Lou Taylor Pucci) attempts to connect with his estranged father in a paradisiacal locale and hotel doorman Jack (Brad Renfro) must cope with a surprise visit from dangerous criminal Peter (Mickey Rourke). Though all are not immediately connected, every life examined shares a similar struggle to grasp the last shreds of humanity they have all but forsaken.The Informers seems to say that indulgence in drugs, alcohol, sex and leisure can lead to a path of self-destructive horror. And for the wayward characters presented in the film that partake in an orgy of decadence, there is no hope for redemption or purification. It is nonstop free-spirited extravagance that bewitches the major parties in The Informers, and a sinking realization that order cannot be reacquired for the dysfunction that saturates the estranged families.The whole film seethes with dark despondency, failing to present any comic relief or bright moments amongst the desperate criminals, unprotected lovers and uncontrollable rock stars. Rampant with random acts of debauchery, a total lack of supervision (which Graham practically begs for), and unexplainable violence, The Informers suffers from dire need of significance. With too many characters, representing the top and bottom of 1980's LA life, along with inconsequential dialogue and relations to fill in the gaps, the reasons behind any of the characters or their multiple narrative subplots is painfully obscure. Much is explored but nothing is explained.

1252464,A3JTBJC5WSEZ7Q,B00275EGNS,Thomas M. Sipos,"[1, 3]","What a mess!This film reminded me of Jay McInterney's novel (later a film), BIG LIGHTS, BRIGHT CITY, another story of 1980s decadence.  Except that that book was coherent, and the lead character, while initially annoying, became sympathetic toward the end.But THE INFORMERS is a mess.  A film about mostly twentysomething white guys, and a few gals, living decadent lives in Los Angeles, on the fringes of the movie and music businesses.  Also some divorced middle-aged folks (none happily married) preying on the young, and on each other.This film tries SO HARD to shock us.  But it's tough to shock an audience these days.  The film's overkill approach only makes us feel contempt for these characters.One young guy is run over by a car. His friends are callous at the funeral.A divorced dad takes his son to Hawaii.  Then dad flirts with the son's date, and mocks his own son in other to impress the date.  This young woman actually responds, preferring dad to son!  Sleazy dad, shallow woman.There's the divorced rock star who sleeps with underage kids of both sexes, at the same time.  He awakes from a drugged stupor, finds the kids in his bed, and, having finished with them, calls security to toss the kids into the hall.There's the aspiring actor.  His uncle, who sexually abused the actor when the actor was a child, shows up with a kidnapped child that he plans to sell to drug lords.There's the obligatory AIDS victim.  A young druggie girl who has a strange new sickness which baffles everyone.  We know she will die.  I guess this is meant to be poignant, but we don't get to know her, and can't admire what little we do see.  Filmmakers have to realize that giving a character AIDS does not automatically confer sympathy.Everyone's drinking, doing drugs, divorced, cheating on their significant other. But apart from the shallow, vain, low-life, creepy characters, the film is further hampered by the story -- there isn't any.There are so many characters, the film couldn't provide meaty story arcs for any of them.  We see only brief sketches, dropping in on one creepy character after another.  We see them betraying, drugging, drinking, and abusing one another, then it's on to the next low-life.  Mostly rich low-lifes, but low-lifes nonetheless.What's the point of this ""slice of life,"" lacking any story or characters of interest.  Is the filmmaker telling us, ""But it's real!  People like this exist!""Yeah, we know.  Films (and reality TV shows) have shown us that for decades.  Such ""slices of life"" are no longer enough.  Your film has to do more.Winona Ryder, once again, has only a tiny cameo.  She's not had many significant roles this decade, and has appeared in mostly  bad films.  A few okay films, but mostly bad.",1,"so, so BORING",1274054400,"05 17, 2010",2010,2744,"['What', 'mess', 'film', 'reminded', 'Jay', 'McInterney', 'novel', 'later', 'film', 'BIG', 'LIGHTS', 'BRIGHT', 'CITY', 'story', '1980s', 'decadence', 'book', 'was', 'coherent', 'lead', 'character', 'initially', 'annoying', 'became', 'sympathetic', 'end.But', 'THE', 'INFORMERS', 'mess', 'film', 'mostly', 'twentysomething', 'white', 'guys', 'few', 'gals', 'living', 'decadent', 'lives', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'fringes', 'movie', 'music', 'businesses', 'Also', 'divorced', 'middle-aged', 'folks', 'none', 'happily', 'married', 'preying', 'young', 'other.This', 'film', 'tries', 'SO', 'HARD', 'shock', 'tough', 'shock', 'audience', 'days', 'film', 'overkill', 'only', 'feel', 'contempt', 'characters.One', 'young', 'guy', 'run', 'over', 'car', 'friends', 'are', 'callous', 'funeral.A', 'divorced', 'dad', 'son', 'Hawaii', 'Then', 'flirts', 'son', 'date', 'own', 'son', 'other', 'impress', 'date', 'young', 'woman', 'actually', 'preferring', 'dad', 'son', 'Sleazy', 'dad', 'shallow', 'divorced', 'rock', 'star', 'who', 'underage', 'kids', 'sexes', 'same', 'time', 'drugged', 'stupor', 'kids', 'bed', 'having', 'finished', 'security', 'toss', 'kids', 'hall.There', 'aspiring', 'actor', 'uncle', 'who', 'sexually', 'abused', 'actor', 'when', 'actor', 'was', 'child', 'up', 'kidnapped', 'child', 'sell', 'drug', 'obligatory', 'AIDS', 'victim', 'young', 'druggie', 'girl', 'who', 'strange', 'new', 'sickness', 'everyone', 'know', 'will', 'die', 'guess', 'meant', 'be', 'poignant', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'know', 'ca', ""n't"", 'admire', 'what', 'little', 'do', 'see', 'Filmmakers', 'have', 'realize', 'giving', 'character', 'AIDS', 'not', 'automatically', 'confer', 'sympathy.Everyone', 'drinking', 'doing', 'drugs', 'divorced', 'cheating', 'significant', 'other', 'apart', 'shallow', 'vain', 'low-life', 'creepy', 'characters', 'film', 'further', 'hampered', 'story', ""n't"", 'are', 'so', 'many', 'characters', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'provide', 'meaty', 'story', 'arcs', 'see', 'only', 'brief', 'sketches', 'dropping', 'one', 'creepy', 'character', 'see', 'betraying', 'drugging', 'drinking', 'abusing', 'one', 'then', 'next', 'low-life', 'Mostly', 'rich', 'low-lifes', 'low-lifes', 'point', 'slice', 'life', 'lacking', 'story', 'characters', 'interest', 'filmmaker', 'telling', 'real', 'People', 'exist', 'Yeah', 'know', 'Films', 'reality', 'TV', 'shows', 'have', 'shown', 'decades', 'Such', 'slices', 'life', 'are', 'longer', 'enough', 'film', 'do', 'more.Winona', 'Ryder', 'once', 'again', 'only', 'tiny', 'cameo', 'not', 'had', 'many', 'significant', 'roles', 'decade', 'appeared', 'mostly', 'bad', 'films', 'few', 'okay', 'films', 'mostly', 'bad']",N/A

The result however was completely underwhelming, and left me feeling disappointed and annoyed at wasting my time on it. The movie plays out ala ""Crash"" in the sense that you have all these characters that are kind of linked with each other through certain circumstances. There's a Hollywood honcho [Billy Bob] who has a tumultuous and strained relationship with his wife [Kim Basinger] because of his dalliances with a newscaster [Winona Ryder]. His son [Jon Foster] is heavily involved in a world of sex and drugs, a world which includes his promiscuous girlfriend [Amber Heard]. There's a father-son pair who can't seem to connect with each other [Chris Isaak and Lou Taylor Pucci], a disillusioned rock star [Mel Raido], and a doorman [Brad Renfro, whose appearance in this movie was his last prior to his death] who is forced to put up with his con artist/criminal uncle [Mickey Rourke] and his nefarious activities [which include the kidnapping of minors].The story arcs seem compelling, but they are never explored with any great level of depth, and the connection between these various arcs are at best, tenuous. I just felt underwhelmed by most of the performances - Billy Bob just seems to have this vacant expression on his face for most of the movie, Amber Heard's performance highlight was exposing her delectable bits and pieces, Brad Renfro blubbers throughout, and the list goes on. The exception was Kim Basinger who is actually quite compelling and credible in the role of the betrayed wife.""The Informers"" tries its best to engage viewers' attention and elicit sympathy, but I felt emotionally disconnected from the major players, and felt the movie was shallow and under-developed in its' theme and characters portrayals.
