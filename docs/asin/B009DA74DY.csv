1595262,A189VV6P4IZJXI,B009DA74DY,Anthony McGill,"[3, 3]","Season seven of Gunsmoke brought about the biggest change in the program. Episodes were extended to one hour and whilst many fans may have preferred the shorter version, I think the longer ones were better, allowing plot lines and characterizations to be more developed.  This batch of episodes includes wonderful guests like John Dehner, Lois Nettleton, John Larch, Buddy Ebsen, Peter Whitney and R.G. Armstrong.  Dennis Weaver who directed three programs in the previous season gets to helm one of the best &#34;Marry Me&#34;,  but most of the directing chores are handled by the accomplished Harry Harris Jr. and Andrew McLaglen and the quality scripts are mainly by the brilliant John Meston and Kathleen Hite.They may not have existed in real life but Matt, Chester, Kitty and Doc, as played by James Arness, Dennis Weaver, Amanda Blake and Milburn Stone made these characters so imprinted in our conscience that most of us are convinced that they really did inhabit Dodge City.  The image of Dodge will always revolve around this superb series which is a credit to all the fine crafts people associated with it during twenty meritorious years.",5,THE BEST OF THEM ALL,1397347200,"04 13, 2014",2014,1149,"['Season', 'seven', 'Gunsmoke', 'brought', 'biggest', 'change', 'program', 'Episodes', 'were', 'extended', 'one', 'hour', 'whilst', 'many', 'fans', 'may', 'have', 'preferred', 'shorter', 'version', 'think', 'longer', 'ones', 'were', 'better', 'allowing', 'plot', 'lines', 'characterizations', 'be', 'more', 'developed', 'batch', 'episodes', 'wonderful', 'guests', 'John', 'Dehner', 'Lois', 'Nettleton', 'John', 'Larch', 'Buddy', 'Ebsen', 'Peter', 'Whitney', 'R.G', 'Armstrong', 'Dennis', 'Weaver', 'who', 'directed', 'three', 'programs', 'previous', 'season', 'helm', 'one', 'best', '34', 'Marry', 'Me', '34', 'most', 'directing', 'chores', 'are', 'handled', 'accomplished', 'Harry', 'Harris', 'Jr.', 'Andrew', 'McLaglen', 'quality', 'scripts', 'are', 'mainly', 'brilliant', 'John', 'Meston', 'Kathleen', 'Hite.They', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'existed', 'real', 'life', 'Matt', 'Chester', 'Kitty', 'Doc', 'played', 'James', 'Arness', 'Dennis', 'Weaver', 'Amanda', 'Blake', 'Milburn', 'Stone', 'made', 'characters', 'so', 'imprinted', 'conscience', 'most', 'are', 'convinced', 'really', 'did', 'inhabit', 'Dodge', 'City', 'image', 'Dodge', 'will', 'always', 'revolve', 'superb', 'series', 'credit', 'fine', 'crafts', 'people', 'associated', 'twenty', 'meritorious', 'years']","Gunsmoke: Season 7, Vol. 1"

While some people state its done in order to make more money for the studio , My main gripe is when it is all said Ill have 40 DVD cases when 20 would have sufficed Not to mention 40 seperate shipments , orders etc... and it seems to take alot longer to get things released. I dont mind paying more for Gunsmoke than other shows since Gunsmoke is a BETTER show than others... Check out the Cost on Star Trek seasons compared to Gunsmoke....Another thing that bothers me and this is about the show itself in Season 7 .... While I like the unpredictability of the endingss it seems like they all end on a sad note ( season 7, Vol 1)... My wife finds this particular Season overall to be depressing . I have to agree ..

She left acting after suffering what was described in the newspapers of the time as a nervous breakdown.  Milly is the story of a teenaged girl who lives in poverty with her younger brother because their father spends all his money on drink.  Milly's friend excaped poverty when she married a rancher and Milly decides the way out of poverty for her and her brother is for her to marry a rich older man.  She visits three men and each rejects her proposal, mainly because they don't take her seriously.  Once rejected Milly seeks revenge by vandalizing their property.  Two of the men hate each other and blame one another for the vandalism, which leads to a life-threatening result for the two men.  The thing I found interesting about Gunsmoke as a TV series is that often the stars to supporting roles in the stories and the guests, Jena Engstrom in this case, were given opportunities to shine.",5,Jean Engstrom as Milly,1401062400,"05 26, 2014",2014,1087,"['bought', 'DVD', 'set', 'one', 'episode', 'Milly', '1961', 'presented', 'young', 'actress', 'named', 'Jena', 'Engstrom', 'what', 'beleive', 'was', 'best', 'acting', 'opportunity', 'short', '4-year', 'career', 'left', 'acting', 'suffering', 'what', 'was', 'described', 'newspapers', 'time', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'Milly', 'story', 'teenaged', 'girl', 'who', 'poverty', 'younger', 'brother', 'father', 'money', 'drink', 'Milly', 'friend', 'excaped', 'poverty', 'when', 'married', 'rancher', 'Milly', 'way', 'poverty', 'brother', 'marry', 'rich', 'older', 'man', 'three', 'men', 'proposal', 'mainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'seriously', 'Once', 'rejected', 'Milly', 'revenge', 'vandalizing', 'property', 'Two', 'men', 'hate', 'other', 'blame', 'one', 'vandalism', 'life-threatening', 'result', 'two', 'men', 'thing', 'found', 'interesting', 'about', 'Gunsmoke', 'TV', 'series', 'often', 'stars', 'supporting', 'roles', 'stories', 'guests', 'Jena', 'Engstrom', 'case', 'were', 'given', 'opportunities', 'shine']","Gunsmoke: Season 7, Vol. 1"

When I started watching the first episode, I couldn't figure out why it seemed like I had seen it recently. Same thing with the second episode. Then I read about the rest of the episodes - these were the episodes shown on Encore Western, so they were rerun many times on Encore. I agree with everyone else...the fact they ""split"" the seasons ends up making Gunsmoke a little pricey in the long run, but it's easier for me (personally) to come up with $25 a hit than $50. But then we have to wait twice as long for the rest of the season to come out too. It's a trade off. At any rate, Gunsmoke was a great show. Personally, I will only ""probably"" buy up to (and including) season 10, as they were in B/W. I feel the stories were better.
