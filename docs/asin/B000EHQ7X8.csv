972747,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000EHQ7X8,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[0, 0]","Like many a horror fan, I have a special place in my little black heart for actor Jeffrey Combs of Re-Animator fame.  You'll notice he gets top billing in Satanic, but don't let that marketing ploy fool you.  The fact is that Jeffrey Combs turns up in only three scenes in this film; you can count his onscreen minutes on one hand.  I knew that going in (it's sort of an open secret), yet the film seemed to hold potential promise for other reasons - sadly, that potential is, for the most part, wasted in this effort.  I liked what the filmmakers tried to do here; the basic idea could have made for an entertaining, even suspenseful film capable of delivering a hammer blow of a final twist.  The cast and crew behind Satanic, though, just weren't up to the task.Annie Sorell (whom many will recognize from the shower scene with her twin sister Alicia in Cruel Intentions 2) plays Michelle, a mixed-up teen recovering from a horrendous automobile accident that took the life of her father.  She has no memory of her past, yet she is haunted by increasingly disturbing nightmares.  Her doctor, Dr. Barbary (Angus Scrimm) has to reconstruct her seriously injured face from photographs, and I think all will agree he does a super-bang-up job of it.  Once the bandages come off, she is moved to Harmony House, a half-way house for problem kids.  (The accident seems to have changed her whole personality because she was reportedly quite a rebel in the past.)  The place is run by a weird, borderline pervert (Rick Dean) and his - well, I don't want to say she's ugly, so I'll just say she's ferociously unattractive - wife (Diane Goldner).  Eliza Swenson seriously heats up the film as Michelle's hot redheaded roommate.  In the grip of her worsening nightmares, Michelle comes to the reluctant conclusion that she not only killed someone, she sacrificed her victim as part of some satanic ritual.  As you no doubt would expect, death soon comes calling at Harmony House, and the whole series of deadly events leads Michelle ever closer to the truth about her past - a truth which will come as no surprise to virtually anyone paying the least bit of attention to the film.Some critics have pretty much raked this film over the coals - and not without reason.  Making people think Jeffrey Combs plays a significant role in the film is rather dirty pool, some of the acting in the film is not very good, and the story never really comes together in an effective way.  All of these things are true, yet I certainly didn't hate this film, nor did I ever finding myself tuning it out.  Satanic just never achieves the cohesion it needs to really work.  I cared very little for any of the characters (except the sultry redhead, of course) and thus felt almost nothing, least of all suspense, as the movie progressed.  The film poses different questions for the viewer to consider, but these essential questions never seem all that important.  The killings were quite unsatisfying, usually taking place off-screen and involving minimal amounts of blood, the film features one of the most boring catfight scenes ever filmed, and the ending is just far too predictable.  All of the pieces for a good psychological horror film are there; director Dan Golden just couldn't put all of them together effectively in the time allotted.",3,Yet another horror film that fails to live up to its potential,1153526400,"07 22, 2006",2006,3318,"['many', 'horror', 'fan', 'have', 'special', 'place', 'little', 'black', 'heart', 'actor', 'Jeffrey', 'Combs', 'Re-Animator', 'fame', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'top', 'billing', 'Satanic', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'marketing', 'ploy', 'fool', 'fact', 'Jeffrey', 'Combs', 'up', 'only', 'three', 'scenes', 'film', 'can', 'count', 'onscreen', 'minutes', 'one', 'hand', 'knew', 'going', 'sort', 'open', 'secret', 'yet', 'film', 'seemed', 'hold', 'potential', 'promise', 'other', 'reasons', 'sadly', 'potential', 'most', 'part', 'wasted', 'effort', 'liked', 'what', 'filmmakers', 'tried', 'do', 'here', 'basic', 'idea', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'entertaining', 'even', 'suspenseful', 'film', 'capable', 'delivering', 'hammer', 'blow', 'final', 'twist', 'cast', 'crew', 'Satanic', 'though', 'just', 'were', ""n't"", 'up', 'task.Annie', 'Sorell', 'whom', 'many', 'will', 'recognize', 'shower', 'scene', 'twin', 'sister', 'Alicia', 'Cruel', 'Intentions', '2', 'plays', 'Michelle', 'mixed-up', 'teen', 'recovering', 'horrendous', 'automobile', 'accident', 'took', 'life', 'father', 'memory', 'past', 'haunted', 'increasingly', 'disturbing', 'nightmares', 'doctor', 'Dr.', 'Barbary', 'Angus', 'Scrimm', 'reconstruct', 'seriously', 'injured', 'face', 'photographs', 'think', 'will', 'agree', 'super-bang-up', 'job', 'bandages', 'come', 'off', 'moved', 'Harmony', 'House', 'half-way', 'house', 'problem', 'kids', 'accident', 'have', 'changed', 'whole', 'personality', 'was', 'reportedly', 'quite', 'rebel', 'past', 'place', 'run', 'weird', 'borderline', 'pervert', 'Rick', 'Dean', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'say', 'ugly', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'ferociously', 'unattractive', 'wife', 'Diane', 'Goldner', 'Eliza', 'Swenson', 'seriously', 'up', 'film', 'Michelle', 'hot', 'redheaded', 'roommate', 'grip', 'worsening', 'nightmares', 'Michelle', 'reluctant', 'conclusion', 'not', 'only', 'killed', 'someone', 'sacrificed', 'victim', 'part', 'satanic', 'ritual', 'doubt', 'would', 'expect', 'death', 'soon', 'calling', 'Harmony', 'House', 'whole', 'series', 'deadly', 'events', 'Michelle', 'ever', 'truth', 'past', 'truth', 'will', 'come', 'surprise', 'virtually', 'anyone', 'paying', 'least', 'bit', 'attention', 'film.Some', 'critics', 'have', 'pretty', 'much', 'raked', 'film', 'coals', 'not', 'reason', 'Making', 'people', 'think', 'Jeffrey', 'Combs', 'significant', 'role', 'film', 'rather', 'dirty', 'pool', 'acting', 'film', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'story', 'never', 'really', 'together', 'effective', 'way', 'things', 'are', 'true', 'yet', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'hate', 'film', 'did', 'ever', 'finding', 'tuning', 'out', 'Satanic', 'just', 'never', 'cohesion', 'really', 'work', 'cared', 'very', 'little', 'characters', 'sultry', 'redhead', 'course', 'thus', 'felt', 'almost', 'nothing', 'least', 'suspense', 'movie', 'progressed', 'film', 'different', 'questions', 'viewer', 'consider', 'essential', 'questions', 'never', 'seem', 'important', 'killings', 'were', 'quite', 'unsatisfying', 'usually', 'taking', 'place', 'off-screen', 'involving', 'minimal', 'amounts', 'blood', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'boring', 'catfight', 'scenes', 'ever', 'filmed', 'ending', 'just', 'far', 'too', 'predictable', 'pieces', 'good', 'psychological', 'horror', 'film', 'are', 'there', 'director', 'Dan', 'Golden', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'put', 'together', 'effectively', 'time', 'allotted']",Satanic

Annie Sorell who plays Michelle, is a minor (even though she's in her late twenties) and is placed in a halfway house for problem children after a car wreck where she developed amnesia. She is plagued by visions of her dead father and has a fancy looking ouija board that was in the car with her during the time of the accident. Michelle tries to understand her past and why she is being tormented by her horrible visions.The acting was really quite horrible, but I did enjoy the performances by the house mother. Eliza Swenson, a sexy redhead, played a pierced out problem teen and she was very entertaining as her character Dalia. The teens in the house go about their day to day business and Michelle has visions and everyone keeps telling her to forget about them because nobody really cares. But she does damn it, and she?s going to get to the bottom of it!The twist at the end of the movie was really unique, but the story was just not really there.
