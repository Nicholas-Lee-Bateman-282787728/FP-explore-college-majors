She seems to have it all--a great job as a web designer and an English boyfriend who is nice, normal person. One morning she locks eyes with a mysterious stranger named Adam Tallis (Joseph Fiennes) and falls instantly in lust. She tracks him down and they have hot sex a couple of times, and Alice quickly ditches her sweet boyfriend who wanted to marry her. The English boyfriend seems like someone who really cares about her and would probably make a great husband, but shallow Alice abruptly dumps him for another man who obviously has a few screws loose. She also impulsively marries this dark, intense man only to find out that all his girlfriends end up dead or missing. Is Adam a murderer?I had a hard time feeling much sympathy for Alice, since she seems selfish and has no sense whatsoever. She likes Adam because he's dangerous and lives on the edge, but it's obvious that their relationship is based on lust, not love, and will burn itself out.There is a ""twist"" at the end, but I've seen similar stuff in other thrillers, and it just lands with a thud.

Now, I'm really easy to please when it comes to movies. But lest anyone wonder why Heather Graham is a one-flick wonder, look no further than ""Killing Me Softly."" Her portrayal of the complex heroine created in the French novel (on which the movie was based) is downright wretched. In the book, Alice is complex -- torn, thoughtful and mature as she subtly comes to doubt Adam's character. In the film version, Graham putzes around looking embarrassingly gauche as she tries to mold Roller Girl into a semblance of something savvy. Instead, she ends up coming across as a giggly, histrionic goof with bad taste in clothes. Fiennes does a superb job with a stinker of a script, and this only acts as a foil to Graham's lack of ability to channel her own character. The sex scenes are just about as erotic as a ""Girls Gone Wild"" teaser, but not for lack of trying. As others have mentioned, there is absolutely zero chemistry between the leads.The French novel had a different and more believable ending, and had the film stuck with the original plot, it would have been far more powerful. It is also a psychological thriller, which are incredibly difficult to translate into film unless you have really great actors and a dazzling script. ""Killing Me Softly"" could have been a much better film with some tweaking and a different female lead.

735566,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B00008972O,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[3, 5]","This film is quite gripping in many ways, but particularly so in one : it tricks us into believing something that is nothing but a preconceived idea. Love may be a very strong, sudden and even violent passion. It is shown in all its splendor and beauty. When love becomes passionate it can lead to extreme adventures, and in this film it does, though moderately for the audience not to be unsettled too much. Just enough for the audience to believe that this passion can lead the man, who is becoming suspicious and jealous, to dream of, and to have dreamed of and even performed, a crime or even several to prevent a woman, or maybe several, from going away, abandoning him. So why not another one. The present wife of this man galops into this avenue without even thinking or pondering the issue one single minute : after all it is nothing but the rewriting or the remake of Blue Beard. Panick and fear. And of course she runs into the arms of the real criminal, the one who has really eliminated so many women, out of jealousy of course. But the real end is more than ambiguous. Passion is transient and cannot last very long. Sooner or later it wears out and it does in this case, of course, after such a fright. So the ending is sad though we may feel relieved. Such men who inspire extreme and total love must be rejected and isolated. A sign that our world is not standing on its feet. But the suspense is quite well built if you just try to let yourself be taken along by the story and not to anticipate what may be coming, the end in other words.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",4,Love is a passionate mousetrap !,1102550400,"12 9, 2004",2004,1576,"['film', 'quite', 'gripping', 'many', 'ways', 'particularly', 'so', 'one', 'believing', 'something', 'nothing', 'preconceived', 'idea', 'Love', 'may', 'be', 'very', 'strong', 'sudden', 'even', 'violent', 'passion', 'shown', 'splendor', 'beauty', 'When', 'love', 'passionate', 'can', 'lead', 'extreme', 'adventures', 'film', 'though', 'moderately', 'audience', 'not', 'be', 'unsettled', 'too', 'much', 'Just', 'enough', 'audience', 'believe', 'passion', 'can', 'lead', 'man', 'who', 'becoming', 'suspicious', 'jealous', 'dream', 'have', 'dreamed', 'even', 'performed', 'crime', 'even', 'several', 'prevent', 'woman', 'maybe', 'several', 'going', 'away', 'abandoning', 'So', 'why', 'not', 'one', 'present', 'wife', 'man', 'avenue', 'even', 'thinking', 'pondering', 'issue', 'one', 'single', 'minute', 'nothing', 'rewriting', 'remake', 'Blue', 'Beard', 'Panick', 'fear', 'course', 'arms', 'real', 'criminal', 'one', 'who', 'really', 'eliminated', 'so', 'many', 'women', 'jealousy', 'course', 'real', 'end', 'more', 'ambiguous', 'Passion', 'transient', 'can', 'not', 'last', 'very', 'long', 'Sooner', 'later', 'out', 'case', 'course', 'fright', 'ending', 'sad', 'may', 'feel', 'relieved', 'Such', 'men', 'who', 'inspire', 'extreme', 'total', 'love', 'must', 'be', 'rejected', 'isolated', 'sign', 'world', 'not', 'standing', 'feet', 'suspense', 'quite', 'well', 'built', 'just', 'try', 'let', 'be', 'taken', 'along', 'story', 'not', 'anticipate', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'coming', 'end', 'other', 'words.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",Killing Me Softly R-Rated Edition
735567,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B00008972O,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[2, 2]","""Killing Me Softly"" has one of those scripts that just don't give the audience a break - not only does it set up an improbable situation, but the big ""twist"" at the end is also mind-numbingly predictable (unless perhaps you haven't seen a thriller before in your life). The chemistry between the two leads is also lacking; Fiennes brings some physical magnetism to his role but as far as his acting is concerned, he's an inexpressive bloke, while Heather Graham is ALL TOO expressive - she overemphasizes every emotion her character is supposed to feeling by making faces at the camera. Besides, she's not even that attractive; even her co-star in this particular film, Natascha McElhone, blows her out of the water in that department. The ending is like when you have a 'jawbreaker' candy in your mouth, sweet and good in the beginning but when you get to the inside its bitter and sour. It was obvious towards the end of the movie that it would turn out like it did, I have seen quite a number of bad movies to figure it out so quicklyIn spite of all that, Chen Kaige's direction is good, and he creates some suspenseful moments. So I give the film a generous ""** out of 5"" rating.

Not made for serious film watchers and critics, this movie is more for the MTV generation and is in the same league of ""Wild Things"" and ""Cruel Intentions"".However, as perverted as this may sound, this film easily features some of the best sex scenes ever to be captured in a commerical film. Heather Graham plays Alice. Alice is an American living in England who designs websites and CD roms for a living and lives with Jake. She loves Jake and feels comfortable around him, but overall she's not satisfied. Then in a few seconds her life changes. While crossing a street, she catches the eye of Adam (Joseph Fiennes) and before they've barely uttered a word they're at his apartment having passionate sex. Soon after, she leaves Jake and moves in with Adam and soon after that...She marries him. Everything's great for a while, until disturbing things begin to happen. She recieves letters, meets a woman who claims that Adam raped her, and finds letters from a lover of Adam's who has disappeared. If you have any knowledge of movies, you can pretty much see where this is going. Wife is scared of husband and tries to unravel whether her husband really is a murderer and is simply not satisfied with what she finds, so she delves deeper into the mystery only to discover something a bit more disturbing. Simply insert a couple different names and you have a story that (for the most part) has been told several times before.

She works for a company in which she makes discs for games. On one morning, she meets a total stranger Adam (Joseph Fiennes). For that split second, she falls in love. They go back to his place and fool around passionatly. The sex scenes, are pretty good for a direct video release. After that she lives with him, and one day, he asks her to marry him. They get married at his familys own church. They go hiking for their honeymoon (not very romatic).After this happens, Alice gets letters from a person saying ""How fare will you let him go""?

""Artist/Designer/Kibitzer""","[55, 61]","Perhaps I got wrapped up in the sex scenes, it was easy to do but I thought this was a first rate well done soft porn movie, perhaps the best I've seen. Killing Me Softly opens a sensuous window into the highly erotic coupling and de-coupling (literally and metaphorically) of two most attractive individuals. Though this movie failed to capture the imagination of most movie reviewers, it did capture mine!Though there are many actors in this movie, it is centered on and revolves around the trinity of Adam, Alice and Deborah (Adam's sister). Alice is a normal girl with a live in boyfriend and a good eight to five job, that is until, on the way to work one morning, she runs into Adam.Adam (Joseph Fiennes) and Alice (Heather Graham) meet at a crosswalk, while she's waiting to cross the street to work. Their eyes lock, Adam smiles and Alice is smitten. Within two minutes, after a taxi ride to Adam's home, with animalistic urgency, our lustful pair is energetically copulating on the living room floor. Is this a courtship made in heaven? I don't think so. Alice didn't even find out his name until the next day, when she went over to a book store across the street from where she works, where she had seen him in the previous day and found out he's the subject of a book, a famous a famous mountain climber, Adam Tallis.After a couple of penetrating sexual-therapy sessions and after dumping her dumpy live in boyfriend, Alice returns for another encore and meets Adam's sister Deborah (Natascha McElhone), who looks suspiciously like a young Jane Seymour. After some pleasant enough girlie talk she sends Alice off the Adam's real house. It seems Adam was using her flat while she was out of town.Soon the newly free Alice moves in with Adam and their romance blossoms and they are in love but then she gets what appears to be a crank letter and that gets her thinking, what does she know about Adam and then there's that padlocked closet in his bedroom.After, Adam saves an overwhelmed and grateful Alice from a mugger, she agrees to get hitched but even after their marriage the letters keep coming and then she finds out that Adam's girlfriend was killed in a climbing accident. All of a sudden Alice is in a panic trying to find out everything she can about the man she's married to.SUMMARYOne has to wonder whether this is a thriller with a wildly erotic undertone woven in or a pleasantly erotic film with a suspenseful base. I think of it as the latter. The film, at one hundred minutes, seems to move quite well with no flat spots and the actors appear to be well suited for their parts. Fiennes did an excellent job of portraying a serious, intense individual with a powerful personality. One could understand why the slightly nave, sensitive character of Alice would gravitate to the overpowering personality of Adam. Graham and McElhone also nailed their respective parts of Alice and the sister Deborah.I also thought the director did a good job although to hear a lot of the critics, you think he failed miserably, in fact of the critics of moviedom only about twenty percent gave this movie a favorable rating overall.CONCLUSIONSorry I'm going to respectfully agree to disagree with the critics and reviewers. There is just too much passionate lusty sex and too much nudity to not consider this film Softcore and in comparison to the many other Softcore movies I've seen, this should be up for a Softcore Academy Award.If you're wondering why you never saw this movie in the theater(I'm speaking to American readers), it's because after showing in theaters in Europe and elsewhere it was released directly on DVD in the states.",5,A Softcore/Thriller - Killing Me Softly,1117584000,"06 1, 2005",2005,3650,"['Perhaps', 'got', 'wrapped', 'up', 'sex', 'scenes', 'was', 'easy', 'do', 'thought', 'was', 'first', 'rate', 'well', 'done', 'soft', 'porn', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Killing', 'Me', 'Softly', 'sensuous', 'window', 'highly', 'erotic', 'coupling', 'de-coupling', 'literally', 'metaphorically', 'two', 'most', 'attractive', 'individuals', 'movie', 'failed', 'capture', 'imagination', 'most', 'movie', 'reviewers', 'did', 'capture', 'mine', 'are', 'many', 'actors', 'movie', 'centered', 'revolves', 'trinity', 'Adam', 'Alice', 'Deborah', 'Adam', 'sister', 'Alice', 'normal', 'girl', 'live', 'boyfriend', 'good', 'eight', 'five', 'job', 'way', 'work', 'one', 'morning', 'Adam.Adam', 'Joseph', 'Fiennes', 'Alice', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'meet', 'crosswalk', 'waiting', 'cross', 'street', 'work', 'eyes', 'lock', 'Adam', 'Alice', 'smitten', 'two', 'minutes', 'taxi', 'ride', 'Adam', 'home', 'animalistic', 'urgency', 'lustful', 'pair', 'energetically', 'copulating', 'living', 'room', 'floor', 'courtship', 'made', 'heaven', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'Alice', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'find', 'out', 'name', 'next', 'day', 'when', 'went', 'book', 'store', 'street', 'where', 'where', 'had', 'seen', 'previous', 'day', 'found', 'subject', 'book', 'famous', 'famous', 'mountain', 'climber', 'Adam', 'Tallis.After', 'couple', 'penetrating', 'sexual-therapy', 'sessions', 'dumping', 'dumpy', 'live', 'boyfriend', 'Alice', 'encore', 'Adam', 'sister', 'Deborah', 'Natascha', 'McElhone', 'who', 'suspiciously', 'young', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'pleasant', 'enough', 'girlie', 'talk', 'Alice', 'Adam', 'real', 'house', 'Adam', 'was', 'using', 'flat', 'was', 'town.Soon', 'newly', 'free', 'Alice', 'moves', 'Adam', 'romance', 'blossoms', 'are', 'love', 'then', 'what', 'be', 'crank', 'letter', 'thinking', 'what', 'know', 'Adam', 'then', 'padlocked', 'closet', 'bedroom.After', 'Adam', 'overwhelmed', 'grateful', 'Alice', 'mugger', 'get', 'hitched', 'even', 'marriage', 'letters', 'keep', 'coming', 'then', 'out', 'Adam', 'girlfriend', 'was', 'killed', 'climbing', 'accident', 'sudden', 'Alice', 'panic', 'trying', 'find', 'out', 'everything', 'can', 'man', 'married', 'to.SUMMARYOne', 'wonder', 'thriller', 'wildly', 'erotic', 'undertone', 'woven', 'pleasantly', 'erotic', 'film', 'suspenseful', 'base', 'think', 'latter', 'film', 'one', 'hundred', 'minutes', 'move', 'quite', 'well', 'flat', 'spots', 'actors', 'appear', 'be', 'well', 'suited', 'parts', 'Fiennes', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', 'serious', 'intense', 'individual', 'powerful', 'personality', 'One', 'could', 'understand', 'why', 'slightly', 'nave', 'sensitive', 'character', 'Alice', 'would', 'gravitate', 'overpowering', 'personality', 'Adam', 'Graham', 'McElhone', 'also', 'nailed', 'respective', 'parts', 'Alice', 'sister', 'Deborah.I', 'also', 'thought', 'director', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'hear', 'lot', 'critics', 'think', 'failed', 'miserably', 'fact', 'critics', 'moviedom', 'only', 'twenty', 'percent', 'gave', 'movie', 'favorable', 'rating', 'overall.CONCLUSIONSorry', ""'m"", 'going', 'respectfully', 'agree', 'disagree', 'critics', 'reviewers', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'passionate', 'lusty', 'sex', 'too', 'much', 'nudity', 'not', 'consider', 'film', 'Softcore', 'comparison', 'many', 'other', 'Softcore', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'should', 'be', 'up', 'Softcore', 'Academy', 'Award.If', ""'re"", 'wondering', 'why', 'never', 'saw', 'movie', 'theater', ""'m"", 'speaking', 'American', 'readers', 'showing', 'theaters', 'Europe', 'elsewhere', 'was', 'released', 'directly', 'DVD', 'states']",Killing Me Softly R-Rated Edition

735588,A2C3GGKSWI4OZB,B00008972O,S. A. S. L.,"[1, 2]","Crazy, animal sex.I received this from Amazon yesterday and watched it last night.  I already knew what I was getting into after reading about 'Killing Me Softly'. But, reviews from critics and viewers mean nothing in the end because, it all boils down to opinion. And everyone's got one.My opinion:  I liked it.  Sometimes, we women just want to see some skin, too.  My motivation for buying this wasn't to see Heather Graham naked.  She could've been dressed the whole time as far as I'm concerned and it would make no difference. The main reason I got this can be summed up in three words:  Joseph Fiennes.  Naked.Having been in a situation almost 90% like Adam and Alice, I 'got' the movie. The only difference was that we shared more than a cab ride and six words and I didn't marry him.And, let's face it ladies, if Joseph or a man that looked like him opened the cab door with that dark, brooding, feral look, resistance would be pretty futile. If that's all he did the whole movie, I still would have been happy. One of my favorite scenes was the autoerotic asphyxiation with the silk scarves. Yeah, I thought it was hot. Maybe because I'm just slightly on this side of crazy? No. Not really. I think the the whole 'it's not normal, so it must be wrong' bit is pretty absurd.  As long as it's done safely and consensually, I don't see a problem.  But when a man is that passionate, surely there's anger just below the surface.  In fantasy, it does the job.  But, in real life, we know it almost never works out with a happy ending.  What a pity.Adam Tallis, played by Joseph Fiennes, is a famous mountain climber with dark secrets in his past. He's controlling and somewhat sadistic but a very passionate and tortured individual. When he meets Alice, played by Heather Graham, the sparks fly. He only knows her first name and she knows nothing about him.  But that doesn't stop them from giving into that instant, sizzling chemistry. No, it's not love at first sight. I don't think it's possible.  Lust, however, is a whole different story.Alice and Adam eventually get married when Alice starts receiving some disturbing notes about Adam. She starts getting suspicious and goes snooping in his locked cabinet and finds old love letters from Adele, who's been missing for 8 months. Then another woman, Michelle, accused him of rape some years back. It wasn't confirmed in the movie but if I had to go on Adam's anger, possessiveness and the need for power, I'm leaning towards a 'yes' on the rape.One of Adam's darkest secrets, in my opinion, was his sister, Deborah. It wasn't the accusation of rape and murder that turned my stomach. It was the fact that Adam and Deborah had more than sibling rivalry going on between them when they were younger. That made her possessive of Adam, thinking that since they had shared the bed, she owned him always. Just another sick, twisted perversion.Some downsides:  I didn't like the music.  When I saw the trailer on the 'Special Features', I wondered why they didn't use that music instead.  Being the Enigma Freak that I am, I would've loved to have heard some 'Mea Culpa', 'Sadeness' or even 'I Love you...I'll Kill You'. But, then again, I think Enigma fits with everything. The movie moved along too fast for my tastes.  I wanted more back story to Adam's life.  Why was he a sadist?  What made him want to do the things he did?  Why did he have trust issues?  What happened in his past to leave him so emotionally scarred?  Did the shared incest make his outlook on women turn negative? I'm willing to bet that it did.  I'd be willing to cut a sex scene or two--minus the silk scarf scene--if they had added 20 minutes extra to delve into the rape, murders and Adele and Adam's story. I understood enough from Alice that I needed no more into her life. I love a mysterious man, but when he's too mysterious, it's easy to get suspicious.  Adam just wanted Alice's trust.  But why?  What was he hiding?I give an overall 4 stars because all in all, I wanted to see Fiennes in all his dark, brooding, grunting glory.  And because, sometimes, you just want to watch movies like this.

Other than the film itself, the DVD also has a Special Features section which has the film's Trailer and some other MGM trailers.The film stars Heather Graham (as Alice; License to Drive, Boogie Nights), Joseph Fiennes (as Adam; Elizabeth, Shakespeare in Love, The Merchant of Venice), and Natascha McElhone (as Deborah; Ronin, Solaris, Laurel Canyon, TV: Revelations).  The film is directed by Chen Kaige (Yellow Earth, Farewell My Concubine, Mo gik), and is based on the book by Nicci French.The movie is about Alice and Adam falling in love, and a jealous sister.  Alice and Adam instantly fall in love, and Alice hurriedly leaves her current living together relationship to move in with Adam.  After a very quick courtship, they get married, but very quickly Alice begins to become suspicious about Adam's past, helped along by some comments by Adam's sister Deborah and some anonymous notes left for her.  Oh, and the movie is narrated by Alice and some man (it is later revealed what that narration is about).The movie opens with Adam up on a snowy mountain climb and Alice living with a man and noting how boring her life has become in London.  Relatively quickly, Alice livens up her life when she bumps into Adam, and they both have an instant spark.  Alice continues into her work building and Adam continues to a bookstore.  That bookstore is selling Adam's new book, about his mountain climbing experiences that includes a death that occurred on his most recent climb. Conveniently, the bookstore was right outside Alice's office building.  Eventually Alice leaves the building, spots Adam, and they get into a taxi together to go to Adam's apartment for some mid-afternoon excitement.Rather quickly Adam and Alice marry, and rather quickly it is revealed that Adam likes to tie up, and/or control the breathing of his partners, and Alice seems to like this type of activity.  Don't want to get too detailed, but Alice quickly becomes suspicious of Adam's past and future plans, and investigates some negative allegations made about Adam.I believe that this was the director's first American film, after finding success over in Asia (I believe in China or maybe Hong Kong; he was born in Beijing China).

735600,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00008972O,Tsuyoshi,"[117, 142]","""Killing Me Softly"" is not that Roberta Flack song Hugh Grant sang on stage in ""About a Boy.""  It is the film version of thriller of the same name written by Nicci French (a pen name of husband-wife team Nicci Gerrard and Sean French).  But what is most attractive is not the origin of the film; it is the first English-speaking film by the critically acclaimed Chinese director Chen Kaige, known for his masterpieces like ""Farewell My Concubine"" and ""Yellow Earth.""  And this thriller set in modern London stars Heather Graham and Jeseph Fiennes (credits in that order), plus Natascha McElhone (""Ronin"") and special appearance of Ian Hart (the first ""Harry Potter"") .  So, you ask me, why should I give only two stars?  Wait a minute, please, but I tell you the story first.Heather Graham is Alice, an American, living in London for 18 months and working as a web site designer there.  She has an English boyfriend (who watches football games on TV), but one morning on her way to office she meets Joseph Fiennes's world-famous mountain climber Adam when Alice accidentally touches his hand, waiting for the signal on the street.  She instantly falls in love with him madly; even in her office she cannot shake off his image; and finally she follows him, goes to his house, and just wants him.  All these things happen in about 5 hours of a day.And they get married.  But soon Alice learns that she does not know anything about his past, not surprisingly.  Then, anonymous letters warning her about him start to come.  Then, Alice begins to suspect that Adam, behind his wild character, is trying to hide some horrible secret that might be connected with the terrible accident that happened on the mountain.  Or is that really an accident?OK.  This is a thriller which uses a premise: ""Can you trust your husband?""  Yes, once Hitchcock did it (the title should remain unnamed, but you might remember that breathtaking car-running-by-the-cliff scene).  For the reasons below, ""Killing Me Softly"" never achieves that height.  The film is thrill-free, and is saddled with incredible plot and creaky dialogues.  I don't like to talk like this especially when I like Heather Graham very much, but before I write this review, I checked it on video, and sorry, but I cannot still change my mind.  (I am a Japanese, and was lucky to see the film earlier than many people in the world as the film was theatrically released here in Feb. 2002, one year before American release).  Yes, thrill is gone.What happened?  Joseph Fiennes does his best, so does Heather Graham, but there is no chemistry between them that might make us believe in their love-turns-fear relation.  Furthermore, the director Chen Kaige is too intent on portraying the sex scenes of them, many of them describing ... how do you say in English ... a sort of kinky stuff.  (So, if you really want to see my point, see the unrated version.)  Besides, what can we audience do but giggle when we see usually great Fiennes holds a poor panting goldfish on his palm, to illustrate the lack of oxygen up among the high mountains?  Or when Heather is mugged in the street of London, robbed of her bag, and Fiennes chases the robber desperately, hits the guys's head against the telephone booth (breaking the glass), and beats the hapless criminal (but which?) to pulp?  And see what they would do after that (I keep that part secret for you).  In short, everything is too unbelievable, even by the standard of melodrama or potboiler.There is, however, some good points about the film.  The photography is very beautiful, capturing the lively feelings of the streets of London, and it is no so-called ""postcard"" beauty.  British photographer Micheal Coulter is famous for his works like ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" ""Notting Hill,"" and ""Sense and Sensibility"" and his London is strangely other-worldly feeling, I mean, totally different London.  The film is always stylish, and the soundtrack is by Patrick Doyle even though his music (good itself) tends to hammer as if to instruct us what to feel.It is cruel to say this, I know, but ""Killing Me Softly"" is, considering the talent involved, a great disappointment.  The film may gain a cult status, and if you ask me whether I like it or not, I say I like it.  But will I recommend this to my friends?  No.One last curious thing; one of the executive-producers is Ivan Reitman (""Evolution"" ""Twins"" and others).",2,"Considering the Talent Involved, the Film is Disappointing",1043712000,"01 28, 2003",2003,4415,"['Killing', 'Me', 'Softly', 'not', 'Roberta', 'Flack', 'song', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'sang', 'stage', 'Boy', 'film', 'version', 'thriller', 'same', 'name', 'written', 'Nicci', 'French', 'pen', 'name', 'husband-wife', 'team', 'Nicci', 'Gerrard', 'Sean', 'French', 'what', 'most', 'attractive', 'not', 'origin', 'film', 'first', 'English-speaking', 'film', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'Chinese', 'director', 'Chen', 'Kaige', 'known', 'masterpieces', 'Farewell', 'My', 'Concubine', 'Yellow', 'Earth', 'thriller', 'set', 'modern', 'London', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'Jeseph', 'Fiennes', 'credits', 'order', 'Natascha', 'McElhone', 'Ronin', 'special', 'appearance', 'Ian', 'Hart', 'first', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'So', 'ask', 'why', 'should', 'give', 'only', 'two', 'stars', 'Wait', 'minute', 'please', 'tell', 'story', 'first.Heather', 'Graham', 'Alice', 'American', 'living', 'London', '18', 'months', 'working', 'web', 'site', 'designer', 'there', 'English', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'watches', 'football', 'games', 'TV', 'one', 'morning', 'way', 'office', 'Joseph', 'Fiennes', 'world-famous', 'mountain', 'climber', 'Adam', 'when', 'Alice', 'accidentally', 'hand', 'waiting', 'signal', 'street', 'instantly', 'love', 'madly', 'even', 'office', 'can', 'not', 'shake', 'off', 'image', 'finally', 'house', 'just', 'things', 'happen', 'about', '5', 'hours', 'day.And', 'get', 'married', 'soon', 'Alice', 'not', 'know', 'anything', 'past', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'Then', 'anonymous', 'letters', 'warning', 'start', 'come', 'Then', 'Alice', 'suspect', 'Adam', 'wild', 'character', 'trying', 'hide', 'horrible', 'secret', 'might', 'be', 'connected', 'terrible', 'accident', 'happened', 'mountain', 'really', 'accident', 'OK', 'thriller', 'premise', 'Can', 'trust', 'husband', 'Yes', 'once', 'Hitchcock', 'did', 'title', 'should', 'remain', 'unnamed', 'might', 'remember', 'breathtaking', 'car-running-by-the-cliff', 'scene', 'reasons', 'Killing', 'Me', 'Softly', 'never', 'height', 'film', 'thrill-free', 'saddled', 'incredible', 'plot', 'creaky', 'dialogues', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'talk', 'especially', 'when', 'like', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'very', 'much', 'write', 'review', 'checked', 'video', 'sorry', 'can', 'not', 'still', 'change', 'mind', 'am', 'Japanese', 'was', 'lucky', 'see', 'film', 'earlier', 'many', 'people', 'world', 'film', 'was', 'theatrically', 'released', 'here', 'Feb.', '2002', 'one', 'year', 'American', 'release', 'Yes', 'happened', 'Joseph', 'Fiennes', 'best', 'so', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'chemistry', 'might', 'make', 'believe', 'love-turns-fear', 'relation', 'Furthermore', 'director', 'Chen', 'Kaige', 'too', 'intent', 'portraying', 'sex', 'scenes', 'many', 'describing', 'how', 'do', 'say', 'English', 'sort', 'kinky', 'stuff', 'So', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'point', 'see', 'unrated', 'version', 'what', 'can', 'audience', 'do', 'giggle', 'when', 'see', 'usually', 'great', 'Fiennes', 'poor', 'panting', 'goldfish', 'palm', 'illustrate', 'lack', 'oxygen', 'high', 'mountains', 'when', 'Heather', 'mugged', 'street', 'London', 'robbed', 'bag', 'Fiennes', 'robber', 'desperately', 'guys', 'head', 'telephone', 'booth', 'breaking', 'glass', 'hapless', 'criminal', 'pulp', 'see', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'keep', 'part', 'secret', 'short', 'everything', 'too', 'unbelievable', 'even', 'standard', 'melodrama', 'potboiler.There', 'however', 'good', 'points', 'film', 'photography', 'very', 'beautiful', 'capturing', 'lively', 'feelings', 'streets', 'London', 'so-called', 'postcard', 'beauty', 'British', 'photographer', 'Micheal', 'Coulter', 'famous', 'works', 'Four', 'Weddings', 'Funeral', 'Notting', 'Hill', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'London', 'strangely', 'other-worldly', 'feeling', 'mean', 'totally', 'different', 'London', 'film', 'always', 'stylish', 'soundtrack', 'Patrick', 'Doyle', 'even', 'music', 'good', 'hammer', 'instruct', 'feel.It', 'cruel', 'say', 'know', 'Killing', 'Me', 'Softly', 'considering', 'talent', 'involved', 'great', 'disappointment', 'film', 'may', 'gain', 'cult', 'status', 'ask', 'like', 'not', 'say', 'will', 'recommend', 'friends', 'No.One', 'last', 'curious', 'thing', 'one', 'executive-producers', 'Ivan', 'Reitman', 'Evolution', 'Twins', 'others']",Killing Me Softly R-Rated Edition
