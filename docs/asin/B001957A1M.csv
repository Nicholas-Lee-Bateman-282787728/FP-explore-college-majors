I think they tried to &#34;tug at the heartstrings&#34; with fabricated myths when the truth is much more touching and interesting.  I was VERY disappointed with this movie, so much I kept fast forwarding thru the cook beating the boy scenes and then thru the evil American captain scenes until I finally just gave up and turned it off.  I would recommend you skip this horrible movie and go and read Susan Orleans book.  It's VERY well written and much more interesting.",1,"hokey, childish, VERY loosely based on the truth",1399334400,"05 6, 2014",2014,1123,"['Well', 'was', 'expecting', 'something', 'bit', 'more', 'mature', 'depth', 'realistic', 'biography', 'one', 'Hollywoods', 'biggest', 'animal', 'stars', 'instead', 'mostly', 'watched', 'pratfall', 'leaden', 'overly', 'childish', 'fable', 'finding', 'Rin', 'Tin', 'TIn', 'actors', 'did', 'best', 'script', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'sad', 'say', 'characters', 'were', 'either', 'made', 'up', 'whole', 'cloth', 'pantomime', 'noble', 'broad', 'be', 'real', 'were', 'NO', 'characters', 'either', 'completely', 'evil', 'white', 'charger', 'good', 'how', 'did', 'mute', 'slavey', 'little', 'boy', 'evil', 'fat', 'cook', 'ever', 'get', 'development', 'so', 'much', 'slapstick', 'schtick', 'even', 'Laurel', 'Hardy', 'movie', 'think', 'tried', '34', 'tug', 'heartstrings', '34', 'fabricated', 'myths', 'when', 'truth', 'much', 'more', 'touching', 'interesting', 'was', 'VERY', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'kept', 'fast', 'forwarding', 'cook', 'beating', 'boy', 'scenes', 'then', 'thru', 'evil', 'American', 'captain', 'scenes', 'finally', 'just', 'gave', 'up', 'turned', 'off', 'would', 'recommend', 'skip', 'horrible', 'movie', 'go', 'read', 'Susan', 'Orleans', 'book', 'VERY', 'well', 'written', 'much', 'more', 'interesting']",Finding Rin Tin Tin

Keeping and training a German Shepard pup isn't all that simple but it offers lessons for us all. Of course Rin Tin Tin has a story complete with a French soldier's good luck charm, a 'little boy lost,' a greedy cook, and a German soldier (POW) who knows how to help. A soldier's tale that warms the heart. There are the good guys, the bad guys and a way to tell the difference!One reviewer commented that it 'was a bit over the top.' Of course it is but in a good way. Good cast and well presented.Another review mentioned how much Rin Tin Tin was incorporated within the history of television.
