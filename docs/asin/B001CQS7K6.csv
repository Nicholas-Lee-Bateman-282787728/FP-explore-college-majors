1177359,A1BMQA5PIZKU1P,B001CQS7K6,"Bryan ""Dragonboots""","[19, 21]","The cover of this dvd says 'the complete season 3' - it is NOT.  Missing is the one hour 'Roast' episode.  They have the moments leading up to the show, the planning of it, etc. and at the end of the episode it says 'To be continued...' hmm, well it did not continue on this dvd apparantly.  It is nowhere to be found.  On the 4th disc is an episode called 'Fan Favorites"" and, to add insult to injury, they show clips from the Roast...that's riiiight the one missing from this DVD.  This is very deceptive of A&E home video and the producers of the show and being a fan of the show, do not appreciate and feel duped just by seeing the world 'complete' on the dvd cover.  So be warned - this does NOT have every episode of season 3.  Why they would leave out the funniest moment of the show and leave us feeling let down is beyond me.  My guess is they want to release it seperately and gouge us a second time with the price.  Very dissapointing.  I suppose the next dvd set of this show they will change the opening music and edit down episodes and not tell anyone just like a lot of the TV show dvds that come out these days.  I wish deceptive practices like this would stop.  This is my only complaint with this dvd.  I'm a huge Kiss/Gene Simmons fan but I was really ticked off by this.

Never gone to a concert.I started watching the show on ""A & E"".It is enjoyable.Now, we can all tell a lot of this stuff is just staged for TV.  You just know because of what you are watching.Example. 1st episode of this season ""Gene's Best Friend"" when their dog Snippy gets lost.  They end up at that night's concert.  Shannon, Nick & Sophie are there.  Nick's friend who we have seen earlier in this episode & in a previous episode got permission from Gene to come & get in free due to his being Nick's friend.  THEN THIS COMPLETELY STAGED SECURITY GUARD WON'T LET THE FRIEND IN, WON'T LISTEN TO NICK OR THE SHOW CREW.  We NEVER see Nick call his parents about this problem.  Then, just all of a sudden Snippy is found & brought to the concert so we can see a staged chase scene.And, the same concert Paul was taken to the hospital.Back of DVD it says this I found interesting  ""their surprisingly charming teenage children"".  That is a surprise?DVD package.  NO chapter or episode list inside so you can see which episodes on a disc if you are looking for certain episode.4 discs & they all have the same photo of Gene on them.  Why not 1 for Gene, 1 for Shannon, 1 for Nick & 1 for Sophie?A few extra features.Decent DVD package.  IF you are a fan of the show, Kiss fan or both you should enjoy the DVD package.

This one, obviously, is also staged, but done very well.  Funny and it looks like the cast is really having a great time working at it.  Seeing Gene's house and family is a treat.  The kids are fun and well raised.  If all families had all this fun, what a great world it could be.  AND, the show does give us a sense of what Gene gives back to his community, other communities in other states and cities, AND to the world.  Not only his talent, but his sharing what he has earned over time to put back into helping others.  Hey Gene!  I could use a little help here, if you ever get around to coming out to the southwestern part of NM.

If I was being picky I'd have to say that it is of course becoming a tad repetitive but it really comes down to if you like the family and enjoy spending a half hour with them at a time...and I do.
