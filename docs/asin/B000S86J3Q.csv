1085557,A2I17T9XB6LSGW,B000S86J3Q,Andrew McCaffrey,"[0, 2]","The Film Crew consists of three alumni of the great movie-mocking TV show, MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000. The premise for this project is not that Mike Nelson, Kevin Murphy and Bill Corbett are trapped in an orbiting satellite; instead, they're three lowly employees at a DVD distributor, charged by their boss to create a commentary track for every movie they release, no matter how obscure or painful.WILD WOMEN OF WONGO is the third film to be subjected to the mocking of The Film Crew.  And once again, the producers have found a movie that is more than silly enough for their purposes.The movie is set in prehistoric times.  Wongo is a tribe populated by ugly men and beautiful women (although their beauty is obvious, their wildness of the title is not).  They are contacted by a prince from the neighboring tribe of Goona who warns that their shared geographical region is shortly to be threatened by a strange race of violent ape-men.  Although the two tribes are within spitting distance, the populations know virtually nothing about each other, and it turns out that Goona is home to very handsome men and extremely unattractive women.  If you can't already figure out where that particular subplot is headed, then you may be the only person to be surprised at the film's conclusion.Judging by the various plot summaries available on the web, one might expect a lot of cheesy battles between regular film extras and film extras in monkey suits.  Unfortunately, the ape-men plot point is more of a MacGuffin than anything else.  We're only ever treated to one ape-men attack.  And we only ever see two ape-men.  And it turns out that they aren't really ape-men at all; they look exactly the same as everyone else in the cast.WONGO is the type of film where it isn't clear what age group the producers are aiming for.  If you were a teenager watching this film you would think the storyline so simplistic as to be aimed at someone half your age.  But if your parents walked into the room, they'd tell you that you're too young to watch a film with such scantily clad models.Of course, the real reason one is purchasing this DVD is not for the lameness of the feature presentation, but for the mocking commentary track provided by the comedians.  And here I felt a little let down in comparison to the previous two films in the series.  There are many very funny jokes; I fell about the place in laughter whenever they noted the similarity one actor had to a specific cartoon character.  But overall, the riffing never fully engaged me, and many times I was simply overwhelmed by the boredom of the film.  There are quality gags sprinkled in the mix, but there isn't the driving force of jokes -- jokes that build and build on each other, keeping the laughter going -- that one finds with the best of MST3k.Although this was my least favorite of the first three Film Crew releases, I'm not going to say that it isn't worth a look.  Even sub-par material from Mike Nelson, Kevin Murphy and Bill Corbett is better than most of what's out there.  I wouldn't start my Film Crew journey here, but if you've already seen the other DVDs and are looking for more, then you should be happy with this.",3,The Wild Wild Women of Wongo,1209340800,"04 28, 2008",2008,3197,"['Film', 'Crew', 'three', 'alumni', 'great', 'movie-mocking', 'TV', 'show', 'MYSTERY', 'SCIENCE', 'THEATER', '3000', 'premise', 'project', 'not', 'Mike', 'Nelson', 'Kevin', 'Murphy', 'Bill', 'Corbett', 'are', 'trapped', 'orbiting', 'satellite', 'instead', ""'re"", 'three', 'lowly', 'employees', 'DVD', 'distributor', 'charged', 'boss', 'create', 'commentary', 'track', 'movie', 'release', 'matter', 'how', 'obscure', 'painful.WILD', 'WOMEN', 'OF', 'WONGO', 'third', 'film', 'be', 'subjected', 'mocking', 'Film', 'Crew', 'once', 'again', 'producers', 'have', 'found', 'movie', 'more', 'silly', 'enough', 'purposes.The', 'movie', 'set', 'prehistoric', 'times', 'Wongo', 'tribe', 'populated', 'ugly', 'men', 'beautiful', 'women', 'beauty', 'obvious', 'wildness', 'title', 'not', 'are', 'contacted', 'prince', 'neighboring', 'tribe', 'Goona', 'who', 'shared', 'geographical', 'region', 'shortly', 'be', 'threatened', 'strange', 'race', 'violent', 'ape-men', 'two', 'tribes', 'are', 'spitting', 'distance', 'populations', 'know', 'virtually', 'nothing', 'other', 'out', 'Goona', 'home', 'very', 'handsome', 'men', 'extremely', 'unattractive', 'women', 'ca', ""n't"", 'already', 'figure', 'out', 'where', 'particular', 'subplot', 'headed', 'then', 'may', 'be', 'only', 'person', 'be', 'surprised', 'film', 'conclusion.Judging', 'various', 'plot', 'summaries', 'available', 'web', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'lot', 'cheesy', 'battles', 'regular', 'film', 'extras', 'film', 'extras', 'monkey', 'suits', 'Unfortunately', 'ape-men', 'plot', 'point', 'more', 'MacGuffin', 'anything', 'else', ""'re"", 'only', 'ever', 'treated', 'one', 'ape-men', 'attack', 'only', 'ever', 'see', 'two', 'ape-men', 'out', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'ape-men', 'look', 'exactly', 'same', 'everyone', 'else', 'cast.WONGO', 'type', 'film', 'where', ""n't"", 'clear', 'what', 'age', 'group', 'producers', 'are', 'aiming', 'were', 'teenager', 'watching', 'film', 'would', 'think', 'storyline', 'so', 'simplistic', 'be', 'aimed', 'someone', 'half', 'age', 'parents', 'walked', 'room', ""'d"", 'tell', ""'re"", 'too', 'young', 'watch', 'film', 'such', 'scantily', 'clad', 'models.Of', 'course', 'real', 'reason', 'one', 'purchasing', 'DVD', 'not', 'lameness', 'feature', 'presentation', 'mocking', 'commentary', 'track', 'provided', 'comedians', 'here', 'felt', 'little', 'let', 'down', 'comparison', 'previous', 'two', 'films', 'series', 'are', 'many', 'very', 'funny', 'jokes', 'fell', 'place', 'laughter', 'whenever', 'noted', 'similarity', 'one', 'actor', 'had', 'specific', 'cartoon', 'character', 'overall', 'riffing', 'never', 'fully', 'engaged', 'many', 'times', 'was', 'simply', 'overwhelmed', 'boredom', 'film', 'are', 'quality', 'gags', 'sprinkled', 'mix', ""n't"", 'driving', 'force', 'jokes', 'jokes', 'build', 'build', 'other', 'keeping', 'laughter', 'going', 'one', 'best', 'MST3k.Although', 'was', 'least', 'favorite', 'first', 'three', 'Film', 'Crew', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'say', ""n't"", 'worth', 'look', 'Even', 'sub-par', 'material', 'Mike', 'Nelson', 'Kevin', 'Murphy', 'Bill', 'Corbett', 'better', 'most', 'what', 'out', 'there', 'would', ""n't"", 'start', 'Film', 'Crew', 'journey', 'here', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'other', 'DVDs', 'are', 'looking', 'more', 'then', 'should', 'be', 'happy']",The Film Crew: Wild Women of Wongo

Yes it sounds like MST3K all over again and besides the lack of silohouettes it basically is.For this feature the guys watch a movie called ""The Wild Women of Wongo"", a bargain basement piece of shlock where we see what happens when Mother Nature and Father Time try to screw with the human race, or maybe thats just cause of the bad screen writers and lack of any interesting or actors period. There's an island called Wongo inhabited by beautiful women and ugly guys and another one called Guna with good looking guys and ugly women, each person is expected to wed someone from their island but they are horrified by those potential mates around them. Enter a good looking dope from the other island and the women of Wongo take to him right away.What are the chances these people from each island find a mate? Pretty good actually as the story is really nothing more than what I've described. Oh I forgot there's also a really annoying parrot and a couple of other stock footage animals. This is really, really ultra cheap. If they spent more than $1,000 on it I would be stunned. The one good thing about the film is the beautiful beach locations, which are obviously Florida locations, it even thanks the state in the opening credits.The crew get a lots of good jokes out of it. They really do rip apart the parrot as it just becomes more and more annoying as the film goes on, and they just shred the actors and horrible dance numbers. They also are baffled by the ending which is just like the worst outtakes from a bad ""Mentos"" commercial. This film gives ""Manos"" a run for its money in the horrid film category.Its quite funny, though not as good as ""The Giant of Marathon"", but about on par with their other release ""Killers From Space"".",4,A good one from the crew,1313020800,"08 11, 2011",2011,1934,"['Mystery', 'Science', 'Theater', '3000', 'other', 'solo', 'projects', 'Mike', 'Nelson', 'Kevin', 'Murphy', 'Bill', 'Corbett', 'teamed', 'up', '4', 'DVD', 'set', 'making', 'fun', 'really', 'terrible', 'movies', 'Yes', 'MST3K', 'over', 'again', 'lack', 'silohouettes', 'basically', 'feature', 'guys', 'watch', 'movie', 'called', 'Wild', 'Women', 'Wongo', 'bargain', 'basement', 'piece', 'shlock', 'where', 'see', 'what', 'when', 'Mother', 'Nature', 'Father', 'Time', 'try', 'screw', 'human', 'race', 'maybe', 'thats', 'just', 'cause', 'bad', 'screen', 'writers', 'lack', 'interesting', 'actors', 'period', 'island', 'called', 'Wongo', 'inhabited', 'beautiful', 'women', 'ugly', 'guys', 'one', 'called', 'Guna', 'good', 'looking', 'guys', 'ugly', 'women', 'person', 'expected', 'wed', 'someone', 'island', 'are', 'horrified', 'potential', 'mates', 'Enter', 'good', 'looking', 'dope', 'other', 'island', 'women', 'Wongo', 'take', 'right', 'are', 'chances', 'people', 'island', 'find', 'mate', 'Pretty', 'good', 'actually', 'story', 'really', 'nothing', 'more', 'what', ""'ve"", 'described', 'Oh', 'forgot', 'also', 'really', 'annoying', 'parrot', 'couple', 'other', 'stock', 'footage', 'animals', 'really', 'really', 'ultra', 'cheap', 'spent', 'more', '1,000', 'would', 'be', 'stunned', 'one', 'good', 'thing', 'film', 'beautiful', 'beach', 'locations', 'are', 'obviously', 'Florida', 'locations', 'even', 'thanks', 'state', 'opening', 'credits.The', 'crew', 'get', 'lots', 'good', 'jokes', 'really', 'do', 'rip', 'apart', 'parrot', 'just', 'more', 'more', 'annoying', 'film', 'just', 'shred', 'actors', 'horrible', 'dance', 'numbers', 'also', 'are', 'baffled', 'ending', 'just', 'worst', 'outtakes', 'bad', 'Mentos', 'commercial', 'film', 'Manos', 'run', 'money', 'horrid', 'film', 'category.Its', 'quite', 'funny', 'though', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Giant', 'Marathon', 'par', 'other', 'release', 'Killers', 'From', 'Space']",The Film Crew: Wild Women of Wongo

To describe the plot of this ""movie"" (and I use that term loosely) is pretty futile, but here goes;The Wongo tribe has decent looking women, but so-called ""brutes"" for men. The Guna tribe has decent looking men, but not so decent looking women (this is the 50's after all). One Guna guy visits the Wongo tribe and warns them of about vicious ""ape-men""...all two of them...that threaten their existence.  One thing leads to another and with the approval of KISS's Paul Stanley in drag, the pretty people are segregated from the ugly ones and all is right with the world.  ""Highlights"" include a six-hour wrasslin' match between a Wongo girl and a 2 foot gator, an eight hour attempted kidnapping scene by the ape men, & a rather large Guna girl giving off a scream so ridiculous that it threatens to take the crown from Big McLargeHuge's scream in the MST3K classic ""Space Mutiny"" for the goofiest moment in film history.Shot with a home movie camera through a cheese cloth, ""Wongo"" is a trial to get through but fortunately we have ""The Film Crew"" to help us along. The riffing is pretty good, especially when it's focused on a rather annoying parrot that seems to fly instantaneously to each scene while squawking one goofy comment after another. The skits are up to snuff, although I found the ""lunch break"" one rather tiresome.  The ""Bonus Features"" are probably the lamest of the three DVDs released so far, but any excuse to have Bill Corbett throw punches is good enough for me.If you're new to ""The Film Crew"" experience, this isn't a bad place to start. If you're already a fan, what are you waiting for?Tidbits:- ""Wongo"" was filmed in Florida...all three acres of it apparently.- The Adrienne Bourbeau in this flick is NOT Adrienne Barbeau of ""The Fog"" or ""Escape from New York"" fame.

I call it an empire because it, and it alone, allowed Comedy Channel, later to become Comedy Central, to survive for so many years.  For years it WAS the only thing on that was fresh, new and funny.Then the show went to the Sci-Fi Channel, which allowed it to be reborn, and giving it a few more years of life.  The Sci-Fi Channel did force them to do more sci-fi, but hey, I like sci-fi, so that's good.Now the show is gone.  But the people behind the show, the people with the minds, the souls, the heart that created the empire are back in The Film Crew.This seems to be the third DVD put out by Mike Nelson, Kevin Murphy and Bill Corbett in which they... well, mist bad movies.

Robot and gone is the iconic front row sillouette where they and Joel/Mike would sit subjecting themselves to all means of cinematic trash.Gone too are the patented MST between movie skits that made the stink-weed films go down easy.Instead, we have The Film Crew-3 humans(Bill, Mike and Kevin-the 2nd MST crew)voicing their comments for the film from off-screen rather than nestled comfortably in a row of theater chairs.Even though there are no Tom Servo or Crow and no comforting front row sillouette this is STILL excellent MST material. Both in the film itself for being such PERFECT riff-fodder and Bill's, Mike's and Kevin's cruise-control expert ribbing of this turkey.The funniest,craziest scene in WWoW,about half way through,involves a trance-like tribal dance by the Wongo women under the spell of a high priestess who repeatedly screams at them to ""DANCE!!!!!!!!!!!!"" and then ""DANCE!!!!!!!!!!!"" yet more. The women are helpless to resist. She yells yet again  ""DANCE!!!!!!!!"" with Bill throwing back a ""Ok, right, because right now we're balancing our check books, waddaya THINK we're doing!""There is a annoying parrot featured throughout the film that isn't CUTE anymore:""Go to parrot hell""-Kevin.But the funniest thing I have EVER seen in ALL of MST history takes place on WWoW's bonus feature where we witness Mike, Kevin and Bill forced to D A N C E by the movie's high priestess as she shrieks ""DANCE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"".I can honestly say I am now a fan of The Film Crew with a viewing of their Hollywood After Dark cementing the deal.The Film Crew are the next best thing to the grand daddy of them all-Mystery Science Theater 3000",4,"""DANCE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!""",1272326400,"04 27, 2010",2010,2162,"['disc', 'nice', 'summation', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'collection', '4', 'Film', 'Crew', 'catalog-highlights', '4', 'films', 'Very', 'enjoyable-a', 'real', 'good', 'editing', 'job', 'Very', 'good', 'promo.There', 'also', 'Zack', 'Galifinackas', 'promo', 'stand-up', 'show', 'made', 'want', 'see', 'brother', 'ADD', 'Ford', 'Focus', 'then', 'main', 'feature.Being', 'fan', 'Mystery', 'Science', 'Theater', 'was', 'first', 'foray', 'Film', 'Crew', 'land', 'so', 'was', 'little', 'concerned.Well', 'course', 'gone', 'are', 'lovable', 'Tom', 'Servo', 'Crow', 'T.', 'Robot', 'gone', 'iconic', 'front', 'row', 'sillouette', 'where', 'Joel/Mike', 'would', 'sit', 'subjecting', 'means', 'cinematic', 'trash.Gone', 'too', 'are', 'patented', 'MST', 'movie', 'skits', 'made', 'stink-weed', 'films', 'go', 'down', 'easy.Instead', 'have', 'Film', 'Crew-3', 'humans', 'Bill', 'Mike', 'Kevin-the', '2nd', 'MST', 'crew', 'voicing', 'comments', 'film', 'off-screen', 'rather', 'nestled', 'comfortably', 'row', 'theater', 'chairs.Even', 'are', 'Tom', 'Servo', 'Crow', 'comforting', 'front', 'row', 'sillouette', 'STILL', 'excellent', 'MST', 'material', 'film', 'being', 'such', 'PERFECT', 'riff-fodder', 'Bill', 'Mike', 'Kevin', 'cruise-control', 'expert', 'ribbing', 'turkey.The', 'funniest', 'craziest', 'scene', 'WWoW', 'way', 'trance-like', 'tribal', 'dance', 'Wongo', 'women', 'spell', 'high', 'priestess', 'who', 'repeatedly', 'screams', 'DANCE', 'then', 'DANCE', 'yet', 'more', 'women', 'are', 'helpless', 'resist', 'yet', 'again', 'DANCE', 'Bill', 'throwing', 'back', 'Ok', 'right', 'right', 'now', ""'re"", 'balancing', 'check', 'books', 'waddaya', 'THINK', ""'re"", 'doing', 'annoying', 'parrot', 'featured', 'film', ""n't"", 'CUTE', 'anymore', 'Go', 'parrot', 'hell', 'funniest', 'thing', 'have', 'EVER', 'seen', 'ALL', 'MST', 'history', 'place', 'WWoW', 'bonus', 'feature', 'where', 'witness', 'Mike', 'Kevin', 'Bill', 'forced', 'D', 'A', 'N', 'C', 'E', 'movie', 'high', 'priestess', 'DANCE', '.I', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'am', 'now', 'fan', 'Film', 'Crew', 'viewing', 'Hollywood', 'Dark', 'cementing', 'deal.The', 'Film', 'Crew', 'are', 'next', 'best', 'thing', 'grand', 'daddy', 'all-Mystery', 'Science', 'Theater', '3000']",The Film Crew: Wild Women of Wongo

I thought that was a particularly crappy move. That's why there were no more Film Crew productions after the initial 4 DVD's.Thankfully, Mike & co. worked their way around it and Rifftrax seems to be thriving, evidently having nothing to do with Shout factory or the Mallon issue.

1085571,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B000S86J3Q,Robert I. Hedges,"[6, 7]","In the latest release from The Film Crew, the guys take on not one, but two, disparate island cultures. The premise is simple: two tribes, Goona and Wongo, inhabit an island. The women of Wongo are beautiful, while the men are ugly (by which I mean average looking), while, predictably, the women of Goona are ugly (really ugly; one of them looks like Divine on a bad day) and the men are handsome. This paves the road for great conflict, but also paves the way for long boring stretches of canoe paddling and stupid subversive plotting just yearning to be mocked.The film opens with amusing credits done in a cave painting motif, and notes that one of the star Wongo women, Wana, is ""Adrienne Bourbeau"" (Barbeau) in a very early role. The other Wongo women get monikers like ""Omoo"" and ""Ahtee."" Needless to say, these names are mocked extensively, with Bill even referring to one woman as ""Mitochondria"" at one point. The central fixture of Wongo life is worshipping a ""dragon god"" which is actually a small alligator. (This was filmed at various tourist traps in Florida.) Women go talk to the alligator, and then interpret the alligator's instructions for the tribal leaders in between frolicking in their authentically native sun dresses and bikinis.This film has loads of filler, and manages to get boring at an alarming pace. Frequently featured is a highly annoying parrot that mostly squawks, but also encourages the women to wrestle each other (with much hair pulling.) The parrot is so annoying that it turns Bill Corbett against the entire animal kingdom before the end.Of course a man from Goona shows up on Wongo and the Wongo women swoon while the men plan to kill him. The women foil their efforts in one of the least plausible screen moments in history. Trivia buffs please note that as the Goona man makes his escape (by canoe) the background music is the exact same music as used during the ""resurrection of the dead"" scene in Ed Wood's infamous ""Plan Nine From Outer Space."" This is at least a welcome break from the rest of the soundtrack, which is highly tuba and bassoon intensive.As the film winds down we see a woman wrestling a small alligator for what seems like an hour, followed by a call-and-response sacrifice ceremony reminiscent of the loyalty vows in ""The Wild, Wild World of Batwoman."" This leads ultimately to a unique fight scene featuring men with clubs against women with spears against an alligator. (The alligator wins.)Of course everyone knows how this is going to work out: the ugly men and women pair up, and the attractive men and women pair up. This leads to much rejoicing, mostly from the audience, as the conclusion draws ever nearer.This is a very lame movie that gets big laughs from the commentary track. There are also extras on the disc, most of which involve very bad interpretative dance, as well as a ""Wongo goodbye"" from The Film Crew, which is hilarious. The ""sacrifice dance"" scene, which features the Wongo women writhing about led by a Queen in an alligator headdress combined with the great commentary earns this a five star rating. I have not laughed quite so hard in a while: I highly recommend it, especially to fans of ""Mystery Science Theater 3000.""I'm looking forward to the next Film Crew releases already!",5,"""Nothing Says 'Caveman' Like Tuba Music.""",1192492800,"10 16, 2007",2007,3275,"['latest', 'release', 'Film', 'Crew', 'guys', 'take', 'not', 'one', 'two', 'disparate', 'island', 'cultures', 'premise', 'simple', 'two', 'tribes', 'Goona', 'Wongo', 'inhabit', 'island', 'women', 'Wongo', 'are', 'beautiful', 'men', 'are', 'ugly', 'mean', 'average', 'looking', 'predictably', 'women', 'Goona', 'are', 'ugly', 'really', 'ugly', 'one', 'Divine', 'bad', 'day', 'men', 'are', 'handsome', 'road', 'great', 'conflict', 'also', 'way', 'long', 'boring', 'stretches', 'canoe', 'paddling', 'stupid', 'subversive', 'plotting', 'just', 'yearning', 'be', 'mocked.The', 'film', 'amusing', 'credits', 'done', 'cave', 'painting', 'motif', 'notes', 'one', 'star', 'Wongo', 'women', 'Wana', 'Adrienne', 'Bourbeau', 'Barbeau', 'very', 'early', 'role', 'other', 'Wongo', 'women', 'get', 'monikers', 'Omoo', 'Ahtee', 'Needless', 'say', 'names', 'are', 'mocked', 'extensively', 'Bill', 'even', 'referring', 'one', 'woman', 'Mitochondria', 'one', 'point', 'central', 'fixture', 'Wongo', 'life', 'worshipping', 'dragon', 'god', 'actually', 'small', 'alligator', 'was', 'filmed', 'various', 'tourist', 'traps', 'Florida', 'Women', 'go', 'talk', 'alligator', 'then', 'interpret', 'alligator', 'instructions', 'tribal', 'leaders', 'frolicking', 'authentically', 'native', 'sun', 'dresses', 'bikinis.This', 'film', 'loads', 'filler', 'get', 'boring', 'alarming', 'pace', 'Frequently', 'featured', 'highly', 'annoying', 'parrot', 'mostly', 'also', 'women', 'wrestle', 'other', 'much', 'hair', 'pulling', 'parrot', 'so', 'annoying', 'Bill', 'Corbett', 'entire', 'animal', 'kingdom', 'end.Of', 'course', 'man', 'Goona', 'up', 'Wongo', 'Wongo', 'women', 'swoon', 'men', 'plan', 'kill', 'women', 'foil', 'efforts', 'one', 'least', 'plausible', 'screen', 'moments', 'history', 'Trivia', 'buffs', 'please', 'note', 'Goona', 'man', 'escape', 'canoe', 'background', 'music', 'exact', 'same', 'music', 'used', 'resurrection', 'dead', 'scene', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'infamous', 'Plan', 'Nine', 'From', 'Outer', 'Space', 'least', 'welcome', 'break', 'rest', 'soundtrack', 'highly', 'tuba', 'bassoon', 'intensive.As', 'film', 'down', 'see', 'woman', 'wrestling', 'small', 'alligator', 'what', 'hour', 'followed', 'call-and-response', 'sacrifice', 'ceremony', 'reminiscent', 'loyalty', 'Wild', 'Wild', 'World', 'Batwoman', 'ultimately', 'unique', 'fight', 'scene', 'featuring', 'men', 'clubs', 'women', 'spears', 'alligator', 'alligator', 'course', 'everyone', 'how', 'going', 'work', 'out', 'ugly', 'men', 'women', 'pair', 'up', 'attractive', 'men', 'women', 'pair', 'up', 'much', 'rejoicing', 'mostly', 'audience', 'conclusion', 'ever', 'nearer.This', 'very', 'lame', 'movie', 'big', 'laughs', 'commentary', 'track', 'are', 'also', 'extras', 'disc', 'most', 'involve', 'very', 'bad', 'interpretative', 'dance', 'as', 'well', 'Wongo', 'goodbye', 'Film', 'Crew', 'hilarious', 'sacrifice', 'dance', 'scene', 'Wongo', 'women', 'writhing', 'led', 'Queen', 'alligator', 'headdress', 'combined', 'great', 'commentary', 'five', 'star', 'rating', 'have', 'not', 'laughed', 'quite', 'so', 'hard', 'while', 'highly', 'recommend', 'especially', 'fans', 'Mystery', 'Science', 'Theater', '3000', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'next', 'Film', 'Crew', 'already']",The Film Crew: Wild Women of Wongo

Josef,"[3, 3]","Three of the masterminds behind MST3K return to skewer the mind-bogglingly ridiculous, absurd and sexist 1950's anti-classic ""The Wild Women of Wongo"". The premise -- a tribe with ugly men and beautiful (in this case, only in the loosest sense of the term) women meet a tribe where the converse is true -- is incredibly lame, even for the time. Mike, Kevin and, especially, Bill, tear this thing to pieces with some truly hilarious remarks worthy of some of the best MST3K episodes, although with a slightly more risque tone than on the TV series.The only problem that I found is with the comedy sketch the guys insert halfway through the film. It's similar in tone to those on MST3K. This sort of thing could be cute and silly when the actors were voicing robot puppets. However, when they're, basically, playing versions of their real selves, it comes off as a bit juvenile and embarassing. The brief bonus material, on the other hand, is fun, because they do some funny take-offs on a couple of the dumber aspects of the film.Still, that's only a minor nitpick -- you can always just skip the sketch, because the commentary on the film is so entertaining.

1085573,A2UR0J92JAR2TW,B000S86J3Q,"Roman Martel ""R. Martel""","[2, 2]","I ended up getting the final round of Film Crew discs after enjoying The Giant of Marathon"" and ""Hollywood After Dark"".  This is the final of the four discs, ""The Wild Women of Wongo"".  Judging from the title and the number for animal print bikinis on the cover I had a feeling this was going to be really funny or really painful.Turns out ""Wild Women of Wongo"" is both.  This movie's budget was really low, with most of the money going to hire women willing to wander around in furry underwear for 90 minutes and the rest spent on renting a parrot and maybe even an alligator or two.  This left roughly a quarter or maybe fifty cents for a script and crew.  The result is a movie in the most basic sense of the word.  The pictures move and there is sound, but the plot is well... dumb.You see Mother Nature shows up and tells us a long time ago she and Father Time created the tribe of Wongo.  It was comprised of lovely women and ugly men.  Then on a neighboring island they set up just the opposite.  Then they stood back and watched the sparks fly.  And fly they do.  One of the pretty boys shows up in Wongo and the women go ga-ga over him.  The Wongo men won't stand for this so they plot to kill the young punk.  Well this doesn't sit well with the women and things go wrong - an alligator god is toppled and the girls are sent off to become human sacrifices.But the movie doesn't end there.  You still have to have an invasion of ape men, a crazy priestess who loves interpretive dance, men getting roped by Wongo women and lots of people running round in fur clothing.This is a bad movie.  No use in beating around the bush here.  Compared to the previous three Film Crew discs, ""Wild Women of Wongo"" is the worst film of the bunch.  It's production values are bargain basement, the script is wretched, the acting is worse, the dancing is hilarious and the ending is so stupid you'll be scanning back to see if you just witnessed a proto-Mentos wink-a-thon.  Add a really annoying talking parrot into the mix and you've got a movie that is punishing.It's perfect for the Film Crew and they jump right in, riffing at everything in sight.  And boy is there plenty to work with.  Unlike the previous three flicks, there are no dull spots in this film.  Each new scene brings forth something perfect for mocking.  It could be the strange hair die on the Wongo men - is that supposed to make them ugly?  It could be the Wongo women who can't seem to remember any of their lines and were obviously chosen for other assists than acting ability.  It could be the endless fight with a pigmy alligator.  It could be priestess who is so over the top and yet so bad of an actress that every line is pure riffing gold.This disc felt most like Mike, Bill and Kevin's previous work at MST3K and future work at Rifftrax.  And that means it's a real winner.  If you're a fan of these guys and want to give Film Crew a try, this is the disc I recommend - lots of laughs to be found here.The three host segments break down this way.  The first is the intro with Bob Honcho telling the crew about the film.  The second has Kevin interrupting lunch again with a detailed discussion on exactly where the island of Wongo is.  Kevin knows it's somewhere on the map near the Island of misfit toys and Narnia.  The finale has Bill with a machine that will match anyone up with his or her perfect mate based only on appearance.  Yeah, I don't see e-harmony using that any time soon.The extras include the Film Crew being compelled to dance, just like the characters in the movie.  Hey if that nutzoid priestess was shouting at me, I'd obey her commands too.  There is also a bit where the Crew attempts to recreate the ending using cardboard hula girls and lots of cheesy facial expressions.This was my favorite disc by the Film Crew.  The previous three movies all had slow spots in them, and these ended up thwarting the riffing.  But ""Wild Women of Wongo"" is full of odd moments, goofy acting and well, just poor film making.  With all that to work with the Film Crew strikes gold.  Not quite a five start effort, but really damn close.",4,The Cult of Izod will Rise Again,1247443200,"07 13, 2009",2009,4121,"['ended', 'up', 'getting', 'final', 'round', 'Film', 'Crew', 'discs', 'enjoying', 'Giant', 'Marathon', 'Hollywood', 'Dark', 'final', 'four', 'discs', 'Wild', 'Women', 'Wongo', 'Judging', 'title', 'number', 'animal', 'print', 'bikinis', 'cover', 'had', 'feeling', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'really', 'funny', 'really', 'out', 'Wild', 'Women', 'Wongo', 'movie', 'budget', 'was', 'really', 'low', 'most', 'money', 'going', 'hire', 'women', 'willing', 'wander', 'around', 'furry', 'underwear', '90', 'minutes', 'rest', 'spent', 'renting', 'parrot', 'maybe', 'even', 'alligator', 'two', 'left', 'roughly', 'quarter', 'maybe', 'fifty', 'cents', 'script', 'crew', 'result', 'movie', 'most', 'basic', 'sense', 'word', 'pictures', 'move', 'sound', 'plot', 'well', 'dumb.You', 'see', 'Mother', 'Nature', 'up', 'tells', 'long', 'time', 'Father', 'Time', 'created', 'tribe', 'Wongo', 'was', 'comprised', 'lovely', 'women', 'ugly', 'men', 'Then', 'neighboring', 'island', 'set', 'up', 'just', 'opposite', 'Then', 'stood', 'back', 'watched', 'sparks', 'fly', 'fly', 'do', 'One', 'pretty', 'boys', 'up', 'Wongo', 'women', 'go', 'ga-ga', 'Wongo', 'men', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stand', 'so', 'plot', 'kill', 'young', 'punk', 'Well', ""n't"", 'sit', 'well', 'women', 'things', 'go', 'wrong', 'alligator', 'god', 'toppled', 'girls', 'are', 'sent', 'become', 'human', 'sacrifices.But', 'movie', ""n't"", 'end', 'there', 'still', 'have', 'have', 'invasion', 'ape', 'men', 'crazy', 'priestess', 'who', 'interpretive', 'dance', 'men', 'getting', 'roped', 'Wongo', 'women', 'lots', 'people', 'running', 'round', 'fur', 'clothing.This', 'bad', 'movie', 'use', 'beating', 'bush', 'here', 'Compared', 'previous', 'three', 'Film', 'Crew', 'discs', 'Wild', 'Women', 'Wongo', 'worst', 'film', 'bunch', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'bargain', 'basement', 'script', 'wretched', 'acting', 'worse', 'dancing', 'hilarious', 'ending', 'so', 'stupid', ""'ll"", 'be', 'scanning', 'back', 'see', 'just', 'witnessed', 'proto-Mentos', 'wink-a-thon', 'Add', 'really', 'annoying', 'talking', 'parrot', 'mix', ""'ve"", 'got', 'movie', 'punishing.It', 'perfect', 'Film', 'Crew', 'jump', 'right', 'riffing', 'everything', 'sight', 'boy', 'there', 'plenty', 'work', 'previous', 'three', 'flicks', 'are', 'dull', 'spots', 'film', 'new', 'scene', 'brings', 'forth', 'something', 'perfect', 'mocking', 'could', 'be', 'strange', 'hair', 'die', 'Wongo', 'men', 'supposed', 'make', 'ugly', 'could', 'be', 'Wongo', 'women', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'remember', 'lines', 'were', 'obviously', 'chosen', 'other', 'assists', 'acting', 'ability', 'could', 'be', 'endless', 'fight', 'pigmy', 'alligator', 'could', 'be', 'priestess', 'who', 'so', 'top', 'yet', 'so', 'bad', 'actress', 'line', 'pure', 'riffing', 'gold.This', 'disc', 'felt', 'most', 'Mike', 'Bill', 'Kevin', 'previous', 'work', 'MST3K', 'future', 'work', 'Rifftrax', 'real', 'winner', ""'re"", 'fan', 'guys', 'want', 'give', 'Film', 'Crew', 'try', 'disc', 'recommend', 'lots', 'laughs', 'be', 'found', 'here.The', 'three', 'host', 'segments', 'break', 'down', 'way', 'first', 'intro', 'Bob', 'Honcho', 'telling', 'crew', 'film', 'second', 'Kevin', 'interrupting', 'lunch', 'again', 'detailed', 'discussion', 'exactly', 'where', 'island', 'Wongo', 'Kevin', 'somewhere', 'map', 'Island', 'misfit', 'toys', 'Narnia', 'finale', 'Bill', 'machine', 'will', 'match', 'anyone', 'up', 'perfect', 'mate', 'based', 'only', 'appearance', 'Yeah', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'e-harmony', 'using', 'time', 'soon.The', 'extras', 'include', 'Film', 'Crew', 'being', 'compelled', 'dance', 'just', 'characters', 'movie', 'Hey', 'nutzoid', 'priestess', 'was', 'shouting', ""'d"", 'obey', 'commands', 'too', 'also', 'bit', 'where', 'Crew', 'attempts', 'recreate', 'ending', 'using', 'cardboard', 'hula', 'girls', 'lots', 'cheesy', 'facial', 'expressions.This', 'was', 'favorite', 'disc', 'Film', 'Crew', 'previous', 'three', 'movies', 'had', 'slow', 'spots', 'ended', 'up', 'thwarting', 'riffing', 'Wild', 'Women', 'Wongo', 'full', 'odd', 'moments', 'goofy', 'acting', 'well', 'just', 'poor', 'film', 'making', 'work', 'Film', 'Crew', 'strikes', 'gold', 'Not', 'quite', 'five', 'start', 'effort', 'really', 'damn', 'close']",The Film Crew: Wild Women of Wongo

The movie itself, Wild Women of Wongo, is less dark and disturbing than Hollywood After Dark (easy to do!) and less dull than Killers From Space (also really easy to do!), so while this is not saying much, it is a ""better"" movie all on its own than the other two from a light amusement standpoint. That said, however, no one is buying these DVDs for the movies alone, but for the hilarious Film Crew commentary that's been added and Kevin, Mike and Bill deliver some pretty good laughs on this one. Besides delivering great commentary during one of the goofiest movies ever made, the host segments are also very entertaining. I particularly liked the ""lunch break"" segment in the middle of the film wherein Kevin Murphy presents his map of how to get to Wongo and the final host segment in which the Crew says goodbye in the style of the final scene of the film is a blast. The extra feature, which recalls the ""Dance...DANCE!"" scene from the film also proves that these fellows still have a knack for physical comedy. Wild Women of Wongo is a forgettable little film that fails miserably at its deliberate attempts at humor, but The Film Crew turn it into an entertaining comedy treat in spite of that.

1085579,A20WKQ948WZOQJ,B000S86J3Q,Wes Saylors Jr.,"[8, 9]","The Beatles had 'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band' and the Beach Boys had 'Pet Sounds'.  And so it is with The Film Crew and 'Wild Women of Wongo.'  Of their output so far, this one is the most satisfying through and through.  As one reviewer said, the movie is just bad and fun enough to be watchable and Mike, Kevin and Bill are highly amusing as they riff on a film that looks like it was shot with a Super 8 mm camera on a public-access beach.  Even the bumper segments are funny (Mike and Bill take lunch appreciation to new heights).  I think, too, for me, the appeal is the fact that Mike and Kevin and Bill have some age on them.  In a decade when comedy is represented by hair gel and those slim, black faux horn-rimmed glasses, these three still 'keep it real'.  It's jeans and t-shirts and not the merest hint of hair coloring in the 'world headquarters of Bob Honcho.'  Like MST3K, we never forget that this venture is home-grown and put together by talented people who are also friends.  You can imagine them calling it a wrap and then going out together with their wives and sharing an appetizer at Applebees (though Bill did go to Yale and may not actually be familiar with chain restaurants).  Film Crew and 'Wild Women of Wongo' is, to date, the best mix of bad movie and comedy talent.  I am optimistic that things will continue to get better.  After all, the Beatles managed to get in a White Album.  And p.s. -- The Wongo good-bye as demonstrated by Mike and Kevin and Bill is hilarious.",5,The Sgt.
