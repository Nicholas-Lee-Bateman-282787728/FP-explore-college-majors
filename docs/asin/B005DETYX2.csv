I didn't even think about it being released on DVD, so when I stumbled upon it here on Amazon, I jumped on it and bought two copies! One was for me and the other copy I gave to one of my older sisters for Christmas. She's 34 and loves a good fun, romantic, fairytale chick flick as much as I do, and I am such a sap for anything even remotely romantic.Lucy Liu is a great leading lady. She plays Rae - a smart, funny, quirky, beautiful and hopeless romantic. I think that is one of the main reasons I like this movie so much, because I'm a hopeless romantic as well, and I can totally relate to Rae. I want everything she wants, and I don't think it's fair for people to tell you that you can't or won't have the fairytale romance of your dreams. Not only is she a dreamer, though, she is a do-gooder, and she plays the role of a charming social worker with ease. It's hard not to like a caring, giving person.The chemistry between the lead characters is undeniable, they seem to fit so naturally together. I kind of thought there might be something going on off screen, that's how good they are at making me believe they are really in love. The character of Imogene is very likable, and she keeps the movie grounded in reality. I liked her jokes and her meddling. Her story is the source for some tears as well, though. Lifetime movies gotta make you cry, right?This movie is filled with good jokes, good romance, adventure, little bit of mystery, those what-will-happen-next moments, attractive characters, tearful moments, a cute little dog and much more. It's great!

1455326,AW3VZ5O895LRK,B005DETYX2,"carol irvin ""carol irvin""","[0, 0]","This was just too much of a rom com movie for me but I can see where lots of women will love it.  Thus, it would lead viewers astray to give it any less than four stars.  It is about a woman social worker-artist, played by Lucy Liu, who dithers over three men that she may or may not wish to marry.  Actually, I think this film is a remake of a film from the fifties starring Jane Powell called The Girl Most Likely (1958).  In that she too was debating over three guys including one rich one, just like in this film.  That is the jist of the movie, she goes from being dumped at the start to having three guys who want to marry her. One is played by dramatic acting powerhouse Bobby Canavale who is wasted in this film. The guy who had a big role in the firefighter show RESCUE ME plays Luke, a clear frontrunner but almost too good to be true. There are some sideplots involving a troubled teenage girl and a sister with a cheating husband but the best supporting role is her mother played by Annie Potts.  If you love romance, chick lit, etc., then this is probably for you.  If you want to see Liu present day in something even better, catch her in ELEMENTARY, where she is Sherlock Holmes's partner, Dr. Joan Watson.",4,Lucy Liu before her smash hit in ELEMENTARY,1385510400,"11 27, 2013",2013,1221,"['was', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'rom', 'com', 'movie', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'lots', 'women', 'will', 'love', 'Thus', 'would', 'lead', 'viewers', 'astray', 'give', 'less', 'four', 'stars', 'woman', 'social', 'worker-artist', 'played', 'Lucy', 'Liu', 'who', 'three', 'men', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'wish', 'marry', 'Actually', 'think', 'film', 'remake', 'film', 'fifties', 'starring', 'Jane', 'Powell', 'called', 'Girl', 'Most', 'Likely', '1958', 'too', 'was', 'debating', 'three', 'guys', 'including', 'one', 'rich', 'one', 'just', 'film', 'jist', 'movie', 'being', 'dumped', 'start', 'having', 'three', 'guys', 'who', 'want', 'marry', 'One', 'played', 'dramatic', 'acting', 'powerhouse', 'Bobby', 'Canavale', 'who', 'wasted', 'film', 'guy', 'who', 'had', 'big', 'role', 'firefighter', 'show', 'RESCUE', 'ME', 'Luke', 'clear', 'frontrunner', 'almost', 'too', 'good', 'be', 'true', 'are', 'sideplots', 'involving', 'troubled', 'teenage', 'girl', 'sister', 'cheating', 'husband', 'best', 'supporting', 'role', 'mother', 'played', 'Annie', 'Potts', 'love', 'romance', 'chick', 'lit', 'etc.', 'then', 'probably', 'want', 'see', 'Liu', 'present', 'day', 'something', 'even', 'better', 'catch', 'ELEMENTARY', 'where', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'partner', 'Dr.', 'Joan', 'Watson']",Marry Me

I used to watch Lifetime in college, but now I don't even bother except for Frasier reruns. But I digress.I saw the preview for this on Hallmark (I think) and as a fan of LL's from back in the Ally McBeal days, and this movie seemed light and fun, so I made plans to tune in. I was verrry pleasantly surprised! The writing was great, the actors were great (very rare that not a single character irritates me), and it was just a great miniseries to watch.From the previews, I thought it was going to be fantasy-based, but it wasn't. One thing I liked about this romance is that they acknowledged that everything was happening fast. One thing I hate about TV movies/romcoms is that everything usually happens in less than a week, so it just seems weird, but even though this one probably took place in 3 months, that fact was lampshaded enough...and then... SPOILER.....Lucy's character still waited a year to get married. So you can imagine that whichever of the guys she married, she still took the time to get to know him. Another pleasant surprise was that, it was only 50/50 percent predictable. I had my #1 guy, but I honestly thought they were going to switch it up...so I was somewhat on the edge of my seat.This could become a Lifetime classic, and I prefer movies like this one and The 12 Men of Christmas to all the killing movies they show. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that I could have done w/o the subplot with the frog boyfriend.P.S. If I may have a shallow moment: I really loved Lucy's wardrobe!

Then the producers just kept complicating it.  I realize that this is part of the romantic comedy formula.  The couple falls in love and then there is some obstacle that they have to overcome in order to be together, but this was too involved and ultimately tedious to watch.  It would have profited from a simpler storyline without the old boyfriend coming back.  For Liu's character even to contemplate giving up the new guy, who is wonderful to her, for the old guy, who treated her shabbily, makes her look like a simpleton.  By the end of the movie, I was so tired of it all that I barely cared which guy she chose.  She's supposedly smart as a whip on her job, but in her love life she's so dumb and indecisive it's annoying.  I wasn't especially impressed with the acting on the part of either boyfriend, but I thought Enrique Murciano's character was captivating.
